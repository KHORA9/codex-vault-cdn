BALLANTYNE.\r\n\r\nIntroduction.\r\n\r\nThe following story is intended to illustrate one of the many phases of\r\nthe fur-trader's life in those wild regions of North America which\r\nsurround Hudson's Bay.\r\n\r\nMost of its major incidents are facts--fiction being employed chiefly\r\nfor the purpose of weaving these facts into a readable form.\r\n\r\nIf this volume should chance to fall into the hands of any of those who\r\nacted a part in the first settlement of Ungava, we trust that they will\r\nforgive the liberty that has been taken with their persons and\r\nadventures, remembering that transpositions, modifications, and\r\ntransformations are necessary in constructing a tale out of the \"raw\r\nmaterial.\"\r\n\r\nWe take this opportunity of expressing to the Leader of the adventurous\r\nband our grateful acknowledgements for his kindness in placing at our\r\ndisposal the groundwork on which this story has been reared.\r\n\r\nR.M.  Ballantyne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE FOREST, AND THE LEADERS OF THE FOLORN-HOPE--A GOOD SHOT--A\r\nCONSULTATION--AN ICE-FLOE, AND A NARROW CHANCE OF ESCAPE IN A SMALL WAY.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! where are you!\" shouted a voice that rang through the glades of\r\nthe forest like the blast of a silver trumpet, testifying to lungs of\r\nleather and a throat of brass.\r\n\r\nThe ringing tones died away, and naught was heard save the rustling of\r\nthe leafy canopy overhead, as the young man, whose shout had thus rudely\r\ndisturbed the surrounding echoes, leaned on the muzzle of a long rifle,\r\nand stood motionless as a statue, his right foot resting on the trunk of\r\na fallen tree, and his head bent slightly to one side, as if listening\r\nfor a reply.  But no reply came.  A squirrel ran down the trunk of a\r\nneighbouring pine, and paused, with tail and ears erect, and its little\r\nblack eyes glittering as if with surprise at the temerity of him who so\r\nrecklessly dared to intrude upon and desecrate with his powerful voice\r\nthe deep solitudes of the wilderness.  They stood so long thus that it\r\nseemed as though the little animal and the man had been petrified by the\r\nunwonted sound.  If so, the spell was quickly broken.  The loud report\r\nof a fowling-piece was heard at a short distance.  The squirrel\r\nincontinently disappeared from the spot on which it stood, and almost\r\ninstantaneously reappeared on the topmost branch of a high tree; while\r\nthe young man gave a smile of satisfaction, threw the rifle over his\r\nshoulder, and, turning round, strode rapidly away in the direction\r\nwhence the shot proceeded.\r\n\r\nA few minutes' walk brought him to the banks of a little brook, by the\r\nside of which, on the projecting root of a tree, sat a man, with a dead\r\ngoose at his feet and a fowling-piece by his side.  He was dressed in\r\nthe garb of a hunter; and, from the number of gray hairs that shone like\r\nthreads of silver among the black curls on his temples, he was evidently\r\npast the meridian of life--although, from the upright bearing of his\r\ntall, muscular frame, and the quick glance of his fearless black eye, it\r\nwas equally evident that the vigour of his youth was not yet abated.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Stanley,\" exclaimed the young man as he approached, \"I've been\r\nshouting till my throat is cracked, for at least half an hour.  I verily\r\nbegan to think that you had forsaken me altogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"In which case, Frank,\" replied the other, \"I should have treated you as\r\nyou deserve, for your empty game-bag proves you an unworthy comrade in\r\nthe chase.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, so, friend, do not boast,\" replied the youth with a smile; \"if I\r\nmistake not, that goose was winging its way to the far north not ten\r\nminutes agone.  Had I come up half an hour sooner, I suspect we should\r\nhave met on equal terms; but the fact is that I have not seen hair or\r\nfeather, save a tree-squirrel, since I left you in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, to say truth, I was equally unfortunate until I met this luckless\r\ngoose, and fired the shot that brought him down and brought you up.  But\r\nI've had enough o' this now, and shall back to the fort again.  What say\r\nyou?  Will you go in my canoe or walk?\"\r\n\r\nThe young man was silent for a few seconds; then, without replying to\r\nhis companion's question, he said,--\"By-the-bye, is it not to-night that\r\nyou mean to make another attempt to induce the men to volunteer for the\r\nexpedition!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" replied Stanley, with a alight frown.  \"And what if they still\r\npersist in refusing to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try once more to shame them out of their cowardice.  But if they\r\nwon't agree, I'll compel them to go by means of more powerful arguments\r\nthan words.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis not cowardice; you do the men injustice,\" said Frank, shaking his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, I believe I do, lad; you're right,\" replied Stanley, while\r\na smile smoothed out the firm lines that had gathered round his lips for\r\na few seconds.  \"No doubt they care as little for the anticipated\r\ndangers of the expedition as any men living, and they hesitate to go\r\nsimply because they know that the life before them will be a lonely one\r\nat such an out-o'-the-way place as Ungava.  But we can't help that,\r\nFrank; the interests of the Company must be attended to, and so go they\r\n_must_, willing or not willing.  But I'm annoyed at this unexpected\r\ndifficulty, for there's a mighty difference between men who volunteer to\r\ngo and men who go merely because they must and can't help it.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man slowly rubbed the stock of his rifle with the sleeve of\r\nhis coat, and looked as if he understood and sympathised with his\r\nfriend's chagrin.\r\n\r\n\"If Prince were only here just now,\" said he, looking up, \"there would\r\nbe no difficulty in the matter.  These fellows only want a bold, hearty\r\ncomrade to step forward and show them the way, and they will follow to\r\nthe North Pole if need be.  They look upon our willingness to go as a\r\nmere matter of course, though I don't see why we should be expected to\r\nlike banishment more than themselves.  But if Prince were--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, Prince is _not_ here, so we must do the best we can without\r\nhim,\" said Stanley.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the trumpet note of a goose was heard in the distance.\r\n\r\n\"There he goes!--down with you!\" exclaimed Frank, darting suddenly\r\nbehind the stump of the tree, while his companion crouched beside him,\r\nand both began to shout at the top of their voices in imitation of the\r\ngoose.  The bird was foolish enough to accept the invitation\r\nimmediately, although, had it been other than a goose, it would have\r\neasily recognised the sound as a wretched counterfeit of the goose\r\nlanguage.  It flew directly towards them, as geese always do in spring\r\nwhen thus enticed, but passed at such a distance that the elder\r\nsportsman was induced to lower his piece.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! he's too far off.  You'd better give him a shot with the rifle,\r\nFrank; but you're sure to miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"To hit, you mean,\" cried his companion, flushing with momentary\r\nindignation at this disparaging remark.  At the same moment he took a\r\nrapid aim and fired.  For a few yards the goose continued its forward\r\nflight as if unhurt; then it wavered once or twice, and fell heavily to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\"Bravo, boy!\" cried Stanley.  \"There, don't look nettled; I only jested\r\nwith you, knowing your weakness on the score of rifle-shooting.  Now,\r\npick up your bird, and throw it into the canoe, for I must away.\"\r\n\r\nFrank finished reloading his piece as his friend spoke, and went to pick\r\nup the goose; while the other walked down to the edge of the rivulet,\r\nand disengaged a light birch-bark canoe from the long grass and sedges\r\nthat almost hid it from view.\r\n\r\n\"Make haste, Frank!\" he shouted; \"there's the ice coming up with the\r\nflood-tide, and bearing down on the creek here.\"\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from the spot where the sportsmen stood, the\r\nstreamlet already alluded to mingled its waters with a broad river,\r\nwhich, a few miles farther down, flows into James's Bay.  As every one\r\nknows, this bay lies to the south of Hudson's Bay, in North America.\r\nHere the river is about two miles wide; and the shores on either side\r\nbeing low, it has all the appearance of an extensive lake.  In spring,\r\nafter the disruption of the ice, its waters are loaded with large floes\r\nand fields of ice; and later in the season, after it has become quite\r\nfree from this wintry encumbrance, numerous detached masses come up with\r\nevery flood-tide.  It was the approach of one of these floes that called\r\nforth Stanley's remark.\r\n\r\nThe young man replied to it by springing towards the canoe, in which his\r\ncompanion was already seated.  Throwing the dead bird into it, he\r\nstooped, and gave the light bark a powerful shove into the stream,\r\nexclaiming, as he did so, \"There, strike out, you've no time to lose,\r\nand I'll go round by the woods.\"\r\n\r\nThere was indeed no time to lose.  The huge mass of ice was closing\r\nrapidly into the mouth of the creek, and narrowing the only passage\r\nthrough which the canoe could escape into the open water of the river\r\nbeyond.  Stanley might, indeed, drag his canoe up the bank, if so\r\ndisposed, and reach home by a circuitous walk through the woods; but by\r\ndoing so he would lose much time, and be under the necessity of carrying\r\nhis gun, blanket, tin kettle, and the goose, on his back.  His broad\r\nshoulders were admirably adapted for such a burden, but he preferred the\r\ncanoe to the woods on the present occasion.  Besides, the only risk he\r\nran was that of getting his canoe crushed to pieces.  So, plunging his\r\npaddle vigorously in the water, he shot through the lessening channel\r\nlike an arrow, and swept out on the bosom of the broad river just as the\r\nice closed with a crash upon the shore and ground itself to powder on\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\n\"Well done!\" shouted Frank, with a wave of his cap, as he witnessed the\r\nsuccess of his friend's exploit.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" replied Stanley, glancing over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nIn another moment the canoe disappeared behind a group of willows that\r\ngrew on the point at the river's mouth, and the young man was left\r\nalone.  For a few minutes he stood contemplating the point behind which\r\nhis companion had disappeared; then giving a hasty glance at the priming\r\nof his rifle, he threw it across his shoulder, and striding rapidly up\r\nthe bank, was soon lost to view amid the luxuriant undergrowth of the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS--THE MEN--DISPUTATION AND UNCERTAINTY--NEW USES FOR THE\r\nSKINS OF DEAD BOYS!--MUTINOUS RESOLVES.\r\n\r\nMoose Fort, the headquarters and depot of the fur-traders, who prosecute\r\ntheir traffic in almost all parts of the wild and uninhabited regions of\r\nNorth America, stands on an island near the mouth of Moose River.  Like\r\nall the establishments of the fur-traders, it is a solitary group of\r\nwooden buildings, far removed beyond the influences--almost beyond the\r\nken--of the civilised world, and surrounded by the primeval wilderness,\r\nthe only tenants of which were, at the time we write of, a few scattered\r\ntribes of Muskigon Indians, and the wild animals whose flesh furnished\r\nthem with food and whose skins constituted their sole wealth.  There was\r\nlittle of luxury at Moose Fort.  The walls of the houses within the\r\nstockade, that served more as an ornament than a defence, were of\r\npainted, in some cases unpainted, planks.  The floors, ceilings, chairs,\r\ntables, and, in short, all the articles of furniture in the place, were\r\nmade of the same rough material.  A lofty scaffolding of wood rose above\r\nthe surrounding buildings, and served as an outlook, whence, at the\r\nproper season, longing eyes were wont to be turned towards the sea in\r\nexpectation of \"the ship\" which paid the establishment an annual visit\r\nfrom England.  Several large iron field-pieces stood before the front\r\ngate; but they were more for the sake of appearance than use, and were\r\nnever fired except for the purpose of saluting the said ship on the\r\noccasions of her arrival and departure.  The first boom of the cannon\r\nunlocks the long-closed portals of connection between Moose Fort and\r\nEngland; the second salvo shuts them up again in their frozen domains\r\nfor another year!  A century and a half ago, the band of \"adventurers\r\ntrading into Hudson's Bay\" felled the first trees and pitched their\r\ntents on the shores of James's Bay, and successive generations of\r\nfur-traders have kept the post until the present day; yet there is\r\nscarcely a symptom of the presence of man beyond a few miles round the\r\nestablishment.  Years ago the fort was built, and there it stands now,\r\nwith new tenants, it is true, but in its general aspect unchanged; and\r\nthere it is likely to remain, wrapped in its barrier of all but\r\nimpregnable solitude, for centuries to come.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Moose is a comfortable place in its way, and when\r\ncontrasted with other trading establishments is a very palace and temple\r\nof luxury.  There are men within its walls who can tell of log-huts and\r\nstarvation, solitude and desolation, compared with which Moose is a\r\nterrestrial paradise.  Frank Morton, whom we have introduced in the\r\nfirst chapter, said, on his arrival at Moose, that it appeared to him to\r\nbe the very fag-end of creation.  He had travelled night and day for six\r\nweeks from what he considered the very outskirts of civilisation,\r\nthrough uninhabited forests and almost unknown rivers, in order to get\r\nto it; and while the feeling of desolation that overwhelmed him on his\r\nfirst arrival was strong upon him, he sighed deeply, and called it a\r\n\"horrid dull hole.\"  But Frank was of a gay, hearty, joyous disposition,\r\nand had not been there long ere he loved the old fort dearly.  Poor\r\nfellow! far removed though he was from his fellow-men at Moose, he\r\nafterwards learned that he had but obtained an indistinct notion of the\r\nsignification of the word \"solitude.\"\r\n\r\nThere were probably about thirty human beings at Moose, when Mr George\r\nStanley, one of the principal fur-traders of the place, received orders\r\nfrom the governor to make preparations, and select men, for the purpose\r\nof proceeding many hundred miles deeper into the northern wilderness,\r\nand establishing a station on the distant, almost unknown, shores of\r\nUngava Bay.  No one at Moose had ever been there before; no one knew\r\nanything about the route, except from the vague report of a few Indians;\r\nand the only thing that was definitely known about the locality at all\r\nwas, that its inhabitants were a few wandering tribes of Esquimaux, who\r\nwere at deadly feud with the Indians, and generally massacred all who\r\ncame within their reach.  What the capabilities of the country were, in\r\nregard to timber and provisions, nobody knew, and, fortunately for the\r\nsuccess of the expedition, nobody cared!  At least those who were to\r\nlead the way did not; and this admirable quality of total indifference\r\nto prospective dangers is that which, to a great extent, insures success\r\nin a forlorn hope.\r\n\r\nOf the leaders of this expedition the reader already knows something.\r\nGeorge Stanley was nearly six feet high, forty years of age, and endued\r\nwith a decision of character that, but for his quiet good humour, would\r\nhave been deemed obstinacy.  He was deliberate in all his movements, and\r\nexercised a control over his feelings that quite concealed his naturally\r\nenthusiastic disposition.  Moreover, he was married, and had a daughter\r\nof ten years of age.  This might be thought a disadvantage in his\r\npresent circumstances; but the governor of the fur-traders, a most\r\nenergetic and active ruler, thought otherwise.  He recommended that the\r\nfamily should be left at Moose until an establishment had been built,\r\nand a winter passed at Ungava.  Afterwards they could join him there.\r\nAs for Frank Morton, he was an inch taller than his friend Stanley, and\r\nequally powerful; fair-haired, blue-eyed, hilarious, romantic,\r\ntwenty-two years of age, and so impulsive that, on hearing of the\r\nproposed expedition from one of his comrades, who happened to be present\r\nwhen Stanley was reading the dispatches, he sprang from his chair, which\r\nhe upset, dashed out at the door, which he banged, and hurried to his\r\nfriend's quarters in order to be first to volunteer his services as\r\nsecond in command; which offer was rendered unnecessary by Stanley's\r\nexclaiming, the moment he entered his room--\r\n\r\n\"Ha, Frank, my lad, the very man I wanted to see!  Here's a letter from\r\nheadquarters ordering me off on an expedition to Ungava.  Now, I want\r\nvolunteers; will you go!\"\r\n\r\nIt is needless to add that Frank's blue eyes sparkled with animation as\r\nhe seized his friend's hand and replied, \"To the North Pole if you like,\r\nor farther if need be!\"\r\n\r\nIt was evening.  The sun was gilding the top of the flagstaff with a\r\nparting kiss, and the inhabitants of Moose Fort, having finished their\r\ndaily toil, were making preparations for their evening meal.  On the end\r\nof the wharf that jutted out into the stream was assembled a picturesque\r\ngroup of men, who, from the earnest manner in which they conversed, and\r\nthe energy of their gesticulations, were evidently discussing a subject\r\nof more than ordinary interest.  Most of them were clad in corduroy\r\ntrousers, gartered below the knee with thongs of deer-skin, and coarse,\r\nstriped cotton shirts, open at the neck, so as to expose their sunburnt\r\nbreasts.  A few wore caps which, whatever might have been their original\r\nform, were now so much soiled and battered out of shape by long and\r\nsevere service that they were nondescript; but most of these hardy\r\nbackwoodsmen were content with the covering afforded by their thick,\r\nbushy locks.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" exclaimed a short, thick-set, powerful man, with a somewhat\r\nascetic cast of countenance; \"I've seen more than enough o' these\r\nrascally Huskies [Esquimaux].  'Tis well for me that I'm here this\r\nblessed day, an' not made into a dan to bob about in Hudson's Straits at\r\nthe tail of a white whale, like that poor boy Peter who was shot by them\r\nvarmints.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's a dan?\" asked a young half-breed who had lately arrived at\r\nMoose, and knew little of Esquimau implements.\r\n\r\n\"What a green-horn you must be, Francois, not to know what a dan is!\"\r\nreplied another, who was inclined to be quizzical.  \"Why, it's a sort of\r\nsea-carriage that the Esquimaux tie to the tail of a walrus or sea-horse\r\nwhen they feel inclined for a drive.  When they can't get a sea-horse\r\nthey catch a white whale asleep, and wake him up after fastening the dan\r\nto his tail.  I suppose they have conjurers or wizards among them, since\r\nMassan told us just now that poor Peter was--\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! gammon,\" interrupted Francois with a smile, as he turned to the\r\nfirst speaker.  \"But tell me, Massan, what is a dan?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a sort o' float or buoy, lad, used by the Huskies, and is made out\r\no' the skin o' the seal.  They tie it with a long line to their whale\r\nspears to show which way the fish bolts when struck.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did they use Peter's skin for such a purpose?\" inquired Francois\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\n\"They did,\" replied Massan.\r\n\r\n\"And did you see them do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did.\"\r\n\r\nFrancois gazed intently into his comrade's face as he spoke; but Massan\r\nwas an adept at what is usually called drawing the long bow, and it was\r\nwith the most imperturbable gravity that he continued--\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I saw them do it; but I could not render any assistance to the\r\npoor child, for I was lying close behind a rock at the time, with an\r\narrow sticking between my shoulders, and a score o' them oily varmints\r\na-shoutin', and yellin', and flourishing their spears in search o' me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us how it happened, Massan.  Let's hear the story,\" chorused the\r\nmen, as they closed round their comrade.\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" began the stout backwoodsman, proceeding leisurely to fill\r\nhis pipe from an ornamented bag that hung at his belt, \"here goes.  It\r\nwas about the year--a--I forget the year, but it don't matter--that we\r\nwere ordered off on an expedition to the Huskies; 'xactly sich a one as\r\nthey wants us to go on now, and--but you've heerd o' that business,\r\nlads, haven't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, we've heard all about it; go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued Massan, \"I needn't be wastin' time tellin' you how we\r\nfailed in that affair, and how the Huskies killed some of our men and\r\nburnt our ship to the water's edge.  After it was all over, and they\r\nthought they had killed us all, I was, as I said, lyin' behind a great\r\nrock in a sort o' cave, lookin' at the dirty villains as they danced\r\nabout on the shore, and took possession of all our goods.  Suddenly I\r\nseed two o' them carry Peter down to the beach, an' I saw, as they\r\npassed me, that he was quite dead.  In less time than I can count a\r\nhundred they took the skin off him, cut off his head, sewed up the hole,\r\ntied his arms and legs in a knot, blew him full o' wind till he was fit\r\nto bu'st, an' then hung him up to dry in the sun!  In fact, they made a\r\n_dan_ of him!\"\r\n\r\nA loud shout of laughter greeted this startling conclusion.  In truth,\r\nwe must do Massan the justice to say, that although he was much in the\r\nhabit of amusing his companions by entertaining them with anecdotes\r\nwhich originated entirely in his own teeming fancy, he never actually\r\n_deceived_ them, but invariably, either by a sly glance or by the\r\nastounding nature of his communication, gave them to understand that he\r\nwas dealing not with fact but fiction.\r\n\r\n\"But seriously, lads,\" said Francois, whose intelligence, added to a\r\ngrave, manly countenance and a tall, muscular frame, caused him to be\r\nregarded by his comrades as a sort of leader both in action and in\r\ncouncil, \"what do you think of our bourgeois' plan?  For my part, I'm\r\nwilling enough to go to any reasonable part o' the country where there\r\nare furs and Indians; but as for this Ungava, from what Massan says,\r\nthere's neither Indians, nor furs, nor victuals--nothin' but rocks, and\r\nmountains, and eternal winter; and if we do get the Huskies about us,\r\nthey'll very likely serve us as they did the last expedition to Richmond\r\nGulf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" cried one of the others, \"you may say that, Francois.  Nothin'\r\nbut frost and starvation, and nobody to bury us when we're dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except the Huskies,\" broke in another, \"who would save themselves the\r\ntrouble by converting us all into dans!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tush, man! stop your clapper,\" cried Francois, impatiently; \"let us\r\nsettle this business.  You know that Monsieur Stanley said he would\r\nexpect us to be ready with an answer to-night.--What think you, Gaspard?\r\nShall we go, or shall we mutiny?\"\r\n\r\nThe individual addressed was a fine specimen of an animal, but not by\r\nany means a good specimen of a man.  He was of gigantic proportions,\r\nstraight and tall as a poplar, and endowed with the strength of a\r\nHercules.  His glittering dark eyes and long black hair, together with\r\nthe hue of his skin, bespoke him of half-breed extraction.  But his\r\ncountenance did not correspond to his fine physical proportions.  True,\r\nhis features were good, but they wore habitually a scowling, sulky\r\nexpression, even when the man was pleased, and there was more of sarcasm\r\nthan joviality in the sound when Gaspard condescended to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be shot if I go to such a hole for the best bourgeois in the\r\ncountry,\" said he in reply to Francois' question.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be dismissed the service if you don't,\" remarked Massan with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nTo this Gaspard vouchsafed no reply save a growl that, to say the best\r\nof it, did not sound amiable.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think that we're all pretty much of one mind on the point,\"\r\ncontinued Francois; \"and yet I feel half ashamed to refuse after all,\r\nespecially when I see the good will with which Messieurs Stanley and\r\nMorton agree to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose _you_ expect to be a bourgeois too some day,\" growled Gaspard\r\nwith a sneer.\r\n\r\n\"Eh, tu gros chien!\" cried Francois, as with flashing eyes and clinched\r\nfists he strode up to his ill-tempered comrade.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, Francois; don't quarrel for nothing,\" said Massan,\r\ninterposing his broad shoulders and pushing him vigorously back.\r\n\r\nAt that moment an exclamation from one of the men diverted the attention\r\nof the others.\r\n\r\n\"Voila! the canoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, it's Monsieur Stanley's canoe.  I saw him and Monsieur Morton start\r\nfor the swamp this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what Dick Prince would have done in this business had he been\r\nhere,\" said Francois to Massan in a low tone, as they stood watching the\r\napproach of their bourgeois' canoe.\r\n\r\n\"Can't say.  I half think he would have gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no chance of him coming back in time, I fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"None; unless he prevails on some goose to lend him a pair of wings for\r\na day or two.  He won't be back from the hunt for three weeks good.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes more the canoe skimmed up to the wharf.\r\n\r\n\"Here, lads,\" cried Mr Stanley, as he leaped ashore and dragged the\r\ncanoe out of the water; \"one of you come and lift this canoe up the\r\nbank, and take these geese to the kitchen.\"\r\n\r\nTwo of the men instantly hastened to obey, and Stanley, with the gun and\r\npaddles under his arm, proceeded towards the gateway of the fort.  As he\r\npassed the group assembled on the wharf, he turned and said--\r\n\r\n\"You'll come to the hall in an hour, lads; I shall expect you to be\r\nready with an answer by that time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" replied several of the men.\r\n\r\n\"But we won't go for all your expectations,\" said one in an undertone to\r\na comrade.\r\n\r\n\"I should think not,\" whispered another.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be hanged, and burnt, and frozen if _I_ do,\" said a third.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mr Stanley walked briskly towards his dwelling, and\r\nleft the men to grumble over their troubles and continue their debate as\r\nto whether they should or should not agree to go on the pending\r\nexpedition to the distant regions of Ungava.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nSHOWS HOW STANLEY DEIGNED TO CONSULT WITH WOMANKIND--THE OPINIONS OF A\r\nCHILD DEVELOPED--PERSUASION FAILS--EXAMPLE TRIUMPHS--THE FIRST\r\nVOLUNTEERS TO UNGAVA.\r\n\r\nOn reaching his apartment, which was in an angle of the principal\r\nedifice in the fort, Mr Stanley flung down his gun and paddles, and\r\ndrawing a chair close to his wife, who was working with her needle near\r\na window, took her hand in his and heaved a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Why, George, that's what you used to say to me when you were at a loss\r\nfor words in the days of our courtship.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, Jessie,\" he replied, patting her shoulder with a hand that rough\r\nservice had rendered hard and long exposure had burnt brown.  \"But the\r\nproducing cause then was different from what it is now.  _Then_ it was\r\nlove; _now_ it is perplexity.\"\r\n\r\nStanley's wife was the daughter of English parents, who had settled many\r\nyears ago in the fur countries.  Being quite beyond the reach of any\r\nschool, they had been obliged to undertake the instruction of their only\r\nchild, Jessie, as they best could.  At first this was an easy matter,\r\nbut as years flew by, and little Jessie's mind expanded, it was found to\r\nbe a difficult matter to carry on her education in a country in most\r\nparts of which books were not to be had and schoolmasters did not exist.\r\nWhen the difficulty first presented itself, they talked of sending\r\ntheir little one to England to finish her education; but being unable to\r\nbring themselves to part with her, they resolved to have a choice\r\nselection of books sent out to them.  Jessie's mother was a clever,\r\naccomplished, and lady-like woman, and decidedly pious, so that the\r\nlittle flower, which was indeed born to blush unseen, grew up to be a\r\ngentle, affectionate woman--one who was a lady in all her thoughts and\r\nactions, yet had never seen polite society, save that of her father and\r\nmother.  In process of time Jessie became Mrs Stanley, and the mother\r\nof a little girl whose voice was, at the time her father entered,\r\nringing cheerfully in an adjoining room.  Mrs Stanley's nature was an\r\nearnest one, and she no sooner observed that her husband was worried\r\nabout something, than she instantly dropped the light tone in which she\r\nat first addressed him.\r\n\r\n\"And what perplexes you now, dear George?\" she said, laying down her\r\nwork and looking up in his face with that straightforward, earnest gaze\r\nthat in days of yore had set the stout backwoodsman's heart on fire, and\r\nstill kept it in a perennial blaze.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing very serious,\" he replied with a smile; \"only these fellows\r\nhave taken it into their stupid heads that Ungava is worse than the land\r\nbeyond the Styx; and so, after the tough battle that I had with you this\r\nmorning in order to prevail on you to remain here for a winter without\r\nme, I've had to fight another battle with them in order to get them to\r\ngo on this expedition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you been victorious?\" inquired Mrs Stanley.\r\n\r\n\"No, not yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really mean to say they are _afraid_ to go?  Has Prince refused?\r\nare Francois, Gaspard, and Massan cowards?\" she inquired, her eye\r\nkindling with indignation.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, my wife, not so.  These men are not cowards; nevertheless they\r\ndon't feel inclined to go; and as for Dick Prince, he has been off\r\nhunting for a week, and I don't expect him back for three weeks at\r\nleast, by which time we shall be off.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Stanley sighed, as if she felt the utter helplessness of woman in\r\nsuch affairs.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Jessie, that's what you used to say to me when you were at a loss\r\nfor words in the days of our courtship,\" said Stanley, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, George, like you I may say that the cause is now perplexity; for\r\nwhat can _I_ do to help you in your present difficulty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly not much.  But I like to tell you of my troubles, and to make\r\nmore of them than they deserve, for the sake of drawing forth your\r\nsympathy.  Bless your heart!\" he said, in a sudden burst of enthusiasm,\r\n\"I would gladly undergo any amount of trouble every day, if by so doing\r\nI should secure that earnest, loving, anxious gaze of your sweet blue\r\neyes as a reward!\"  Stanley imprinted a hearty kiss on his wife's cheek\r\nas he made this lover-like speech, and then rose to place his\r\nfowling-piece on the pegs from which it usually hung over the fireplace.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the door opened, and a little girl, with bright eyes and\r\nflaxen hair, bounded into the room.\r\n\r\n\"O mamma, mamma!\" she said, holding up a sheet of paper, while a look of\r\nintense satisfaction beamed on her animated countenance, \"see, I have\r\ndrawn Chimo's portrait.  Is it like, mamma?  Do you think it like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come here, Eda, my darling, come to me,\" said Stanley, seating himself\r\non a chair and extending his arms.  Edith instantly left the portrait of\r\nthe dog in her mother's possession, and, without waiting for an opinion\r\nas to its merits, ran to her father, jumped on his knee, threw her arms\r\nround his neck, and kissed him.  Edith was by no means a beautiful\r\nchild, but miserable indeed must have been the taste of him who would\r\nhave pronounced her plain-looking.  Her features were not regular; her\r\nnose had a strong tendency to what is called snubbed, and her mouth was\r\nlarge; but to counterbalance these defects she had a pair of large,\r\ndeep-blue eyes, soft, golden hair, a fair, rosy complexion, and an\r\nexpression of sweetness at the corners of her mouth that betrayed\r\nhabitual good-nature.  She was quick in all her movements, combined with\r\na peculiar softness and grace of deportment that was exceedingly\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to go, my pet,\" said her father, \"to a country far, far\r\naway in the north, where there are high mountains and deep valleys,\r\ninhabited by beautiful reindeer, and large lakes and rivers filled with\r\nfish; where there is very little daylight all the long winter, and where\r\nthere is scarcely any night all the long, bright summer?  Would my Eda\r\nlike to go there?\"\r\n\r\nThe child possessed that fascinating quality of being intensely\r\ninterested in all that was said to her.  As her father spoke, her eyes\r\ngradually expanded and looked straight into his, while her head turned\r\nslowly and very slightly to one side.  As he concluded, she replied,\r\n\"Oh! very, very, _very_ much indeed,\" with a degree of energy that made\r\nboth her parents laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my darling! would that my lazy men were endued with some of your\r\nspirit,\" said Stanley, patting the child's head.\r\n\r\n\"Is Prince a lazy man, papa?\" inquired Edith anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No, certainly, Prince is not.  Why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I love Prince.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you not love all the men?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Edith, with some hesitation; \"at least I don't love them\r\n_very_ much, and I hate one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hate one!\" echoed Mrs Stanley.  \"Come here, my darling.\"\r\n\r\nEda slipped from her father's knee and went to her mother, feeling and\r\nlooking as if she had said something wrong.\r\n\r\nMrs Stanley was not one of those mothers who, whenever they hear of\r\ntheir children having done anything wrong, assume a look of intense,\r\nsolemnised horror, that would lead an ignorant spectator to suppose that\r\nintelligence had just been received of some sudden and appalling\r\ncatastrophe.  She knew that children could not be deceived by such\r\npieces of acting.  She expressed on her countenance precisely what she\r\nfelt--a slight degree of sorrow that her child should cherish an evil\r\npassion, which, she knew, existed in her heart in common with all the\r\nhuman race, but which she expected, by God's help and blessing, to\r\nsubdue effectually at last.  Kissing Eda's forehead she said\r\nkindly,--\"Which of them do you hate, darling?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gaspard,\" replied the child.\r\n\r\n\"And why do you hate him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he struck my dog,\" said Eda, while her face flushed and her\r\neyes sparkled; \"and he is always rude to everybody, and very, _very_\r\ncruel to the dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very wrong of Gaspard; but, dearest Eda, do you not remember\r\nwhat is written in God's Word,--`Love your enemies?'  It is wrong to\r\n_hate_ anybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that, mamma, and I don't wish to hate Gaspard, but I can't help\r\nit.  I wish if I didn't hate him, but it _won't_ go away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my pet,\" replied Mrs Stanley, pressing the child to her bosom,\r\n\"but you must pray for him, and speak kindly to him when you meet him,\r\nand that will perhaps put it away.  And now let us talk of the far-off\r\ncountry that papa was speaking about.  I wonder what he has to tell you\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\nStanley had been gazing out of the window during the foregoing colloquy,\r\napparently inattentive, though, in reality, deeply interested in what\r\nwas said.  Turning round, he said--\r\n\r\n\"I was going to tell Eda that you had arranged to follow me to that\r\ncountry next year, and that perhaps you would bring her along with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, George, you mistake.  I did not arrange to do so--you only\r\nproposed the arrangement; but, to say truth, I don't like it, and I\r\ncan't make up my mind to let you go without us.  I cannot wait till next\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, Jessie, I have exhausted all my powers of persuasion.  I\r\nleave it entirely to yourself to do as you think best.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the sound of deep voices was heard in the hall, which was\r\nseparated from Stanley's quarters by a thin partition of wood.  In a few\r\nseconds the door opened, and George Barney, the Irish butler and general\r\nfactotum to the establishment, announced that the \"min wos in the hall\r\nawaitin'.\"\r\n\r\nGiving Eda a parting kiss, Stanley rose and entered the hall, where\r\nFrancois, Massan, Gaspard, and several others were grouped in a corner.\r\nOn their bourgeois entering, they doffed their bonnets and bowed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, lads,\" began Stanley, with a smile, \"you've thought better of it,\r\nI hope, and have come to volunteer for this expedition--\" He checked\r\nhimself and frowned, for he saw by their looks that they had come with\r\nquite a different intention.  \"What have you to say to me?\" he continued\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\nThe men looked uneasily at each other, and then fixed their eyes on\r\nFrancois, who was evidently expected to be spokesman.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Francois, speak out,\" said Stanley; \"if you have any objections,\r\nout with them; you're free to say what you please here.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, and ere Francois could reply, Frank Morton entered the\r\nroom.  \"Ah!\" he exclaimed, as he deposited his rifle in a corner and\r\nflung his cap on the table, \"in time, I see, to help at the council!\"\r\n\r\n\"I was just asking Francois to state his objections to going,\" said\r\nStanley, as his young friend took his place beside him.\r\n\r\n\"Objections!\" repeated Frank; \"what objections can bold spirits have to\r\ngo on a bold adventure?  The question should have been, `Who will be\r\nfirst to volunteer?'\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door of Stanley's apartment opened, and his wife\r\nappeared leading Eda by the hand.\r\n\r\n\"Here are two volunteers,\" she said, with a smile; \"pray put us at the\r\nhead of your list.  We will go with you to any part of the world!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" shouted Frank, catching up Eda, with whom he was a great\r\nfavourite, and hugging her tightly in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but, wife, this is sheer folly.  You know not the dangers that\r\nawait you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not,\" interrupted Mrs Stanley; \"but _you_ know them, and that\r\nis enough for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, Jessie, I know them not.  I can but guess at them.--But, ah!\r\nwell, 'tis useless to argue further.  Be it so; we shall head the list\r\nwith you and Eda.\"\r\n\r\n\"And put my name next,\" said a deep-toned voice from behind the other\r\nmen.  All turned round in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Dick Prince!\" they exclaimed; \"you here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, lads,\" said a tall man of about forty, who was not so remarkable\r\nfor physical development (though in this respect he was by no means\r\ndeficient) as for a certain decision of character that betrayed itself\r\nin every outline of his masculine, intelligent countenance--\"ay, lads,\r\nI'm here; an' sorry am I that I've jist comed in time to hear that\r\nyou're sich poor-spirited rascals as to hang back when ye should jump\r\nfor'ard.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how came you so opportunely, Prince?\" inquired Stanley.\r\n\r\n\"I met an Injin, sir, as told me you was goin' off; so I thought you\r\nmight want me, and comed straight back.  And now, sir, I'm ready to go;\r\nand so is Francois,\" he continued, turning to that individual, who\r\nseized his hand and exclaimed, \"That am I, my boy--to the moon if ye\r\nlike!\"\r\n\r\n\"And Massan, too,\" continued Prince.\r\n\r\n\"All right; book me for Nova Zembla,\" replied that worthy.\r\n\r\n\"So, so,\" cried Mr Stanley, with a satisfied smile.  \"I see, lads, that\r\nwe're all of one mind now.  Is it not so?  Are we agreed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed! agreed!\" they replied with one voice.\r\n\r\n\"That's well,\" he continued.  \"Now then, lads, clear out and get your\r\nkits ready.--And ho!  Barney, give these men a glass of grog.--Prince, I\r\nshall want to talk with you this evening.  Come to me an hour hence.--\r\nAnd now,\" he added, taking Eda by the hand, \"come along, my gentle\r\nvolunteers; let's go to supper.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nEXPLANATORY, BUT NOT DRY!--MURDEROUS DESIGNS THWARTED BY VIGOROUS\r\nTREATMENT--THE CATTLE PAY FOR IT!--PREPARATIONS FOR A LONG, LONG VOYAGE.\r\n\r\nIn order to render our story intelligible, it is necessary here to say a\r\nfew words explanatory of the nature and object of the expedition\r\nreferred to in the foregoing chapters.\r\n\r\nMany years previous to the opening of our tale, it was deemed expedient,\r\nby the rulers of the Hudson's Bay Fur Company, to effect, if possible, a\r\nreconciliation or treaty of peace between the Muskigon Indians of\r\nJames's Bay and the Esquimaux of Hudson's Straits.  The Muskigons are by\r\nno means a warlike race; on the contrary, they are naturally timid, and\r\nonly plucked up courage to make war on their northern neighbours in\r\nconsequence of these poor people being destitute of firearms, while\r\nthemselves were supplied with guns and ammunition by the fur-traders.\r\nThe Esquimaux, however, are much superior to the Muskigon Indians\r\nphysically, and would have held their adversaries in light esteem had\r\nthey met on equal terms, or, indeed, on any terms at all; but the evil\r\nwas that they never met.  The Indians always took them by surprise, and\r\nfrom behind the rocks and bushes sent destruction into their camps with\r\nthe deadly bullet; while their helpless foes could only reply with the\r\ncomparatively harmless arrow and spear.  Thus the war was in fact an\r\nannual raid of murderers.  The conceited Muskigons returned to their\r\nwigwams in triumph, with bloody scalps hanging at their belts; while the\r\nEsquimaux pushed farther into their ice-bound fastnesses, and told their\r\ncomrades, with lowering brows and heaving bosoms, of the sudden attack,\r\nand of the wives and children who had been butchered in cold blood, or\r\nled captive to the tents of the cowardly red men.\r\n\r\nAt such times those untutored inhabitants of the frozen regions vowed\r\nvengeance on the Indians, and cursed in their hearts the white men who\r\nsupplied them with the deadly gun.  But the curse was unmerited.  In the\r\ncouncils of the fur-traders the subject of Esquimau wrongs had been\r\nmooted, and plans for the amelioration of their condition devised.\r\nTrading posts were established on Richmond Gulf and Little Whale River;\r\nbut owing to circumstances which it is unnecessary to detail here, they\r\nturned out failures, and were at length abandoned.  Still, those in\r\ncharge of the districts around Hudson's Bay and Labrador continued to\r\nuse every argument to prevail on the Indians to cease their murderous\r\nassaults on their unoffending neighbours, but without much effect.  At\r\nlength the governor of East Main--a territory lying on the eastern\r\nshores of James's Bay--adopted an argument which proved eminently\r\nsuccessful, at least for one season.\r\n\r\nHis fort was visited by a large band of Muskigons from Albany and Moose\r\ndistricts, who brought a quantity of valuable furs, for which they\r\ndemanded guns and ammunition, making no secret of their intention to\r\nproceed on an expedition against their enemies the Esquimaux.  On\r\nhearing of this, the governor went out to them, and, in a voice of\r\nextreme indignation, assured them that they should not have an ounce of\r\nsupplies for such a purpose.\r\n\r\n\"But we will pay you for what we ask.  We are not beggars!\" exclaimed\r\nthe astonished Indians, into whose calculations it had never entered\r\nthat white traders would refuse good furs merely in order to prevent the\r\ndeath of a few Esquimaux.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" cried the angry governor, snatching up the nearest bale of\r\nfurs--\"see, that's all I care for you or your payment!\" and hurling the\r\npack at its owner's head, he felled him therewith to the ground.  \"No,\"\r\nhe continued, shaking his fist at them, \"I'll not give you as much\r\npowder or shot as would blow off the tail of a rabbit, if you were to\r\nbring me all the skins in Labrador!\"\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this vigorous conduct was that the Indians retired\r\ncrestfallen--utterly discomfited.  But in the camp that night they\r\nplotted revenge.  In the darkness of the night they slaughtered all the\r\ncattle around the establishment, and before daybreak were over the hills\r\nand far away in the direction of their hunting-grounds, loaded with\r\nfresh beef sufficient for the supply of themselves and their families\r\nfor the winter!  It was a heavy price to pay; but the poor Esquimaux\r\nremained unmolested that year, while the Indians received a salutary\r\nlesson.  But the compulsory peace was soon broken, and it became\r\napparent that the only effectual way to check the bloodthirsty\r\npropensity of the Indians was to arm their enemies with the gun.  The\r\ndestruction of the first expedition to the Esquimaux, and the bad\r\nfeeling that existed in the minds of the natives of Richmond Gulf\r\nconsequent thereon, induced the fur-traders to fix on another locality\r\nfor a new attempt.  It was thought that the remote solitudes of Ungava\r\nBay, at the extreme north of Labrador,--where the white man's axe had\r\nnever yet felled the stunted pines of the north, nor the ring of his\r\nrifle disturbed its echoes,--would be the spot best suited for the\r\nerection of a wooden fort.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, it was appointed that Mr George Stanley should select a\r\ncoadjutor, and proceed with a party of picked men to the scene of action\r\nas early in the spring as the ice would permit, and there build a fort\r\nas he best could, with the best materials he could find; live on\r\nwhatever the country afforded in the shape of food; establish a trade in\r\noil, whalebone, arctic foxes, etcetera, etcetera, if they were to be\r\ngot; and bring about a reconciliation between the Esquimaux and the\r\nIndians of the interior, if that were possible.  With the careful\r\nminuteness peculiar to documents, Stanley's instructions went on to\r\npoint out that he was to start from Moose--with two half-sized canoes,\r\neach capable of carrying ten _pieces_ or packages of 90 pounds weight\r\neach, besides the crew--and _bore_ through the ice, if the ice would\r\nallow him, till he should reach Richmond Gulf; cross this gulf, and\r\nascend, if practicable, some of the rivers which fall into it from the\r\nheight of land supposed, but not positively known, to exist somewhere in\r\nthe interior.  Passing this height, he was to descend by the rivers and\r\nlakes (if such existed) leading to the eastward, until he should fall\r\nupon a river reported to exist in these lands, and called by the natives\r\n_Caniapuscaw_, or South River, down which he was to proceed to the scene\r\nof his labours, Ungava Bay; on reaching which he was considerately left\r\nto the unaided guidance of his own discretion!  Reduced to their lowest\r\nterm and widest signification, the instructions directed our friend to\r\nstart as early as he could, with whom he chose, and with what he liked;\r\ntravel as fast as possible over _terra incognita_ to a land of ice--\r\nperhaps, also, of desolation--and locate himself among bloody savages.\r\nIt was hoped that there would be found a sufficiency of trees wherewith\r\nto build him a shelter against a prolonged winter; in the meantime he\r\nmight enjoy a bright arctic summer sky for his canopy!\r\n\r\nBut it was known, or at least supposed, that the Esquimaux were fierce\r\nand cruel savages, if not cannibals.  Their very name implies something\r\nof the sort.  It signifies _eaters of raw flesh_, and was bestowed on\r\nthem by their enemies the Muskigons.  They call themselves _Innuit_-men,\r\nor warriors; and although they certainly do eat raw flesh when necessity\r\ncompels them--which it often does--they asserted that they never did so\r\nfrom choice.  However, be this as it may, the remembrance of their\r\nmisdeeds in the first expeditions was fresh in the minds of the men in\r\nthe service of the fur-traders, and they evinced a decided unwillingness\r\nto venture into such a country and among such a people,--an\r\nunwillingness which was only at length overcome when Mrs Stanley and\r\nher little daughter heroically volunteered to share the dangers of the\r\nexpedition in the manner already narrated.\r\n\r\nStanley now made vigorous preparations for his departure.  Some of the\r\nmen had already been enrolled, as we have seen, and there were more than\r\nenough of able and active volunteers ready to complete the crews.\r\n\r\n\"Come hither, lads,\" he cried, beckoning to two men who were occupied on\r\nthe bank of the river, near the entrance to Moose Fort, in repairing the\r\nside of a canoe.\r\n\r\nThe men left their work and approached.  They were both Esquimaux, and\r\ngood stout, broad-shouldered, thick-set specimens of the race they were.\r\nOne was called Oolibuck, [_This name is spelt as it should be\r\npronounced.  The correct spelling is Ouligbuck_], the other Augustus;\r\nboth of which names are now chronicled in the history of arctic\r\nadventure as having belonged to the well-tried and faithful interpreters\r\nto Franklin, Back, and Richardson, in their expeditions of north-west\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to see you busy at the canoe, boys,\" said Stanley, as they\r\ncame up.  \"Of course you are both willing to revisit your countrymen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, we is.  Glad to go where you choose send us,\" answered\r\nOolibuck, whose broad, oily countenance lighted up with good-humour as\r\nhe spoke.\r\n\r\n\"It will remind you of your trip with Captain Franklin,\" continued\r\nStanley, addressing Augustus.\r\n\r\n\"Me no like to 'member dat,\" said the Esquimau, with a sorrowful shake\r\nof the head.  \"Me love bourgeois Franklin, but tink me never see him\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that, old fellow,\" returned Stanley, with a smile.\r\n\"Franklin is not done with his discoveries yet; there's a talk of\r\nsending off another expedition some of these days, I hear, so you may\r\nhave a chance yet.\"\r\n\r\nAugustus's black eyes sparkled with pleasure as he heard this.  He was a\r\nman of strong feeling, and during his journeyings with our great arctic\r\nhero had become attached to him in consequence of the hearty and\r\nunvarying kindness and consideration with which he treated all under his\r\ncommand.  But the spirit of enterprise had been long slumbering, and\r\npoor Augustus, who was now past the prime of life, feared that he should\r\nnever see his kind master more.\r\n\r\n\"Now I want you, lads, to get everything in readiness for an immediate\r\nstart,\" continued Stanley, glancing upwards at the sky; \"if the weather\r\nholds, we shan't be long off paying your friends a visit.  Are both\r\ncanoes repaired?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, they is,\" replied Oolibuck.\r\n\r\n\"And the baggage, is it laid out?  And--\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon, monsieur,\" interrupted Massan, walking up, and touching his\r\ncap.  \"I've jest been down at the point, and there's a rig'lar\r\nnor'-wester a-comin' down.  The ice is sweepin' into the river, an'\r\nit'll be choked up by to-morrow, I'm afraid.\"\r\n\r\nStanley received this piece of intelligence with a slight frown, and\r\nlooked seaward, where a dark line on the horizon and large fields of ice\r\nshowed that the man's surmise was likely to prove correct.\r\n\r\n\"It matters not,\" said Stanley, hastily; \"I've made arrangements to\r\nstart to-morrow, and start we shall, in spite of ice or wind, if the\r\ncanoes will float!\"\r\n\r\nMassan, who had been constituted principal steersman of the expedition,\r\nin virtue of his well-tried skill and indomitable energy, felt that the\r\ntone in which this was said implied a want of confidence in his\r\nwillingness to go under _any_ circumstances, so he said gravely--\r\n\r\n\"Pardon, monsieur; I did not say we could not start.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, true, Massan; don't be hurt.  I was only grumbling at the\r\nweather,\" answered Stanley, with a laugh.\r\n\r\nJust then the first puff of the coming breeze swept up the river,\r\nruffling its hitherto glassy surface.\r\n\r\n\"There it comes,\" cried Stanley, as he quitted the spot.  \"Now, Massan,\r\nsee to it that the crews are assembled in good time on the beach\r\nto-morrow.  We start at daybreak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oui, monsieur,\" replied Massan, as he turned on his heel and walked\r\naway.  \"Parbleu! we shall indeed start to morrow, an it please you, if\r\nall the ice and wind in the polar regions was blowed down the coast and\r\ncrammed into the river's mouth.  C'est vrai!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nICE LOOKS UNPROPITIOUS--THE START--AN IMPORTANT MEMBER OF THE PARTY\r\nNEARLY FORGOTTEN--CHIMO.\r\n\r\nStanley's forebodings and Massan's prognostications proved partly\r\nincorrect on the following morning.  The mouth of the river, and the sea\r\nbeyond, were quite full of ice; but it was loose, and intersected in all\r\ndirections by lanes of open water.  Moreover, there was no wind.\r\n\r\nThe gray light of early morning brightened into dawn, and the first\r\nclear ray of the rising sun swept over a scene more beautiful than ever\r\nfilled the fancy of the most imaginative poet of the Temperate Zones.\r\nThe sky was perfectly unclouded, and the surface of the sea was\r\ncompletely covered with masses of ice, whose tops were pure white like\r\nsnow, and their sides a delicate greenish-blue, their dull, frosted\r\nappearance forming a striking contrast to the surrounding water, which\r\nshone, when the sun glanced upon it, like burnished silver.  The masses\r\nof ice varied endlessly in form and size, some being flat and large like\r\nfields, others square and cornered like bastions or towers--here a\r\nminiature temple with spires and minarets, there a crystal fortress with\r\nembrasures and battlements; and, in the midst of these, thousands of\r\nbroken fragments, having all the varied outlines of the larger masses,\r\nappearing like the smaller houses, cottages, and villas of this floating\r\ncity of ice.\r\n\r\n\"Oh how beautiful!\" exclaimed little Edith, as her father led her and\r\nMrs Stanley towards the canoes, which floated lightly in the water,\r\nwhile the men stood in a picturesque group beside them, leaning on their\r\nbright red paddles.\r\n\r\n\"It is indeed, my pet,\" replied Stanley, a smile almost of sadness\r\nplaying around his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Come, George, don't let evil forebodings assail you to-day,\" said Mrs\r\nStanley in a low tone.  \"It does not become the leader of a forlorn hope\r\nto cast a shade over the spirits of his men at the very outset.\"  She\r\nsmiled as she said this, and pressed his arm; but despite herself, there\r\nwas more of sadness in the smile and in the pressure than she intended\r\nto convey.\r\n\r\nStanley's countenance assumed its usual firm but cheerful expression\r\nwhile she spoke.  \"True, Jessie, I must not damp the men; but when I\r\nlook at you and our darling Eda, I may be forgiven for betraying a\r\npassing glance of anxiety.  May the Almighty protect you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the country we are going to like this, papa?\" inquired Eda, whose\r\nintense admiration of the fairy-like scene rendered her oblivious of all\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear, more like this than anything else you have ever seen; but\r\nthe sun does not always shine so brightly as it does just now, and\r\nsometimes there are terrible snow-storms.  But we will build you a nice\r\nhouse, Eda, with a very large fireplace, so that we won't feel the\r\ncold.\"\r\n\r\nThe entire population of Moose Fort was assembled on the beach to\r\nwitness the departure of the expedition.  The party consisted of fifteen\r\nsouls.  As we shall follow them to the icy regions of Ungava, it may be\r\nworth while to rehearse their names in order as follows:--\r\n\r\n  MR. AND MRS. STANLEY and EDITH.\r\n  FRANK MORTON.\r\n  MASSAN, the guide.\r\n  DICK PRINCE, principal hunter to the party.\r\n  LA ROCHE, Stanley's servant and cook.\r\n  BRYAN, the blacksmith.\r\n  FRANCOIS, the carpenter.\r\n  OOLIBUCK, AUGUSTUS, and MOSES, Esquimau\r\n  interpreters.\r\n  GASPARD, labourer and fisherman.\r\n  OOSTESIMOW and MA-ISTEQUAN, Indian guides\r\n  and hunters.\r\n\r\nThe craft in which these were about to embark were three canoes, two of\r\nwhich were large and one small.  They were made of birch bark, a\r\nsubstance which is tough, light, and buoyant, and therefore admirably\r\nadapted for the construction of craft that have not only to battle\r\nagainst strong and sometimes shallow currents, but have frequently to be\r\ncarried on the shoulders of their crews over rocks and mountains.  The\r\nlargest canoe was sixteen feet long by five feet broad in the middle,\r\nnarrowing gradually towards the bow and stern to a sharp edge.  Its\r\nloading consisted of bales, kegs, casks, and bundles of goods and\r\nprovisions; each bale or cask weighed exactly 90 pounds, and was called\r\na _piece._ There were fifteen pieces in the canoe, besides the crew of\r\nsix men, and Mr Stanley and his family, who occupied the centre, where\r\ntheir bedding, tied up in flat bundles and covered with oiled cloth,\r\nformed a comfortable couch.  Notwithstanding the size and capacity of\r\nthis craft, it had been carried down to the beach on the shoulders of\r\nMassan and Dick Prince, who now stood at its bow and stern, preventing\r\nit with their paddles from rubbing its frail sides against the wharf;\r\nfor although the bark is tough, and will stand a great deal of tossing\r\nin water and plunging among rapids, it cannot sustain the slightest blow\r\nfrom a rock or other hard substance without being cracked, or having the\r\ngum which covers the seams scraped off.  To those who are unacquainted\r\nwith travelling in the wild regions of the north it would seem\r\nimpossible that a long journey could be accomplished in such tender\r\nboats; but a little experience proves that, by judicious treatment and\r\ncareful management, voyages of great length may be safely accomplished\r\nin them--that they are well adapted for the necessities of the country,\r\nand can be taken with greater ease through a rough, broken, and\r\nmountainous region than ordinary wooden boats, even of smaller size,\r\ncould be.\r\n\r\nThe second canoe was in all respects similar to the one we have\r\ndescribed, excepting that it was a few inches shorter.  The third was\r\nmuch smaller--so small that it could not contain more than three men,\r\nwith their provisions and a few bales, and so light that it could with\r\nthe greatest ease be carried on the shoulders of one man.  It was\r\nintended to serve as a sort of pioneer and hunting craft, which should\r\nlead the way, dart hither and thither in pursuit of game, and warn the\r\nmain body of any danger that should threaten them ahead.  It was manned\r\nby the two Indian guides, Oostesimow and Ma-istequan, and by Frank\r\nMorton, who being acknowledged one of the best shots of the party, was\r\nby tacit understanding regarded as commissary-general.  It might have\r\nbeen said that Frank was the best shot, were it not for the fact that\r\nthe aim of Dick Prince was perfect, and it is generally admitted that\r\nperfection cannot be excelled.\r\n\r\nAlthough differing widely in their dispositions and appearance, the men\r\nof the expedition were similar at least in one respect--they were all\r\nfirst-rate, and had been selected as being individually superior to\r\ntheir comrades at Moose Fort.  And a noble set of fellows they looked,\r\nas they stood beside their respective canoes, leaning on their little,\r\nbrilliantly coloured paddles, awaiting the embarkation of their leaders.\r\nThey all wore new suits of clothes, which were sufficiently similar to\r\ngive the effect of a uniform, yet so far varied in detail as to divest\r\nthem of monotony, and relieve the eye by agreeable contrast of bright\r\ncolours.  All of them wore light-blue cloth capotes with hoods hanging\r\ndown behind, all had corduroy trousers gartered below the knee, and all\r\nwore moccasins, and had fire-bags stuck in their belts, in which were\r\ncontained the materials for producing fire, tobacco, and pipes.  So far\r\nthey were alike, but the worsted belts of some were scarlet, of others\r\ncrimson, and of others striped.  Some gartered their trousers with\r\nthongs of leather, others used elegant bands of bead-work--the gifts,\r\nprobably, of sorrowing sweethearts, sisters, or mothers--while the\r\nfire-bags, besides being composed some of blue, some of scarlet cloth,\r\nwere ornamented more or less with flowers and fanciful devices elegantly\r\nwrought in the gaily-dyed quills of the porcupine.\r\n\r\nOn seeing Stanley and his wife and child approaching, Massan gave the\r\norder to embark.  In a moment every man divested himself of his capote,\r\nwhich he folded up and placed on the seat he was to occupy; then,\r\nshaking hands all round for the last time, they stepped lightly and\r\ncarefully into their places.\r\n\r\n\"All ready, I see, Massan,\" said Stanley, as he came up, \"and the ice\r\nseems pretty open.  How say you? shall we make a good day of it?\"\r\n\r\nMassan smiled dubiously as he presented his thick shoulder as a support\r\nto Mrs Stanley, while she stepped into her place.  He remembered the\r\nconversation of the previous evening, and determined that, whatever\r\nshould happen, he at least would not cast the shadow of a doubt on their\r\nprospects.  But in his own mind he suspected that their progress would\r\nbe interrupted ere long, as the wind, although very light--almost\r\nimperceptible--was coming from the north-west.\r\n\r\n\"It'll be full flood in less nor half an hour,\" he replied, \"and--(take\r\ncare, Miss Edith, give me your little hand; there, now, jump light)--and\r\nwe'll be past the p'int by that time, and git the good o' the ebb till\r\nsun-down.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear,\" said Frank Morton, approaching, \"that the ice is rather thick\r\nfor us; but it don't much matter, it will only delay us a bit--and at\r\nany rate we'll make good way as far as the point.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, true,\" said Stanley; \"and it's a great matter to get fairly\r\nstarted.  Once off we must go forward.  All ready, lads?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Frank, into your canoe and show us the way; mind we trust to your\r\nguidance to keep us clear of blind alleys among these lanes of water in\r\nthe ice.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Edith--who had been for the last few minutes occupied in\r\nalternately drying her eyes and kissing her hands to a group of little\r\nchildren who had been her play-fellows during her sojourn at the fort--\r\nuttered a loud exclamation.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! oh! papa, mamma--Chimo!--we've forgot Chimo!  Oh me! don't go away\r\nyet!\"\r\n\r\n\"So we have!\" said her father; \"dear me, how stupid to forget our old\r\nfriend!--Hallo!  Frank, Frank, we've forgot the dog,\" shouted Stanley to\r\nhis young comrade, who was on the point of starting.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, Frank gave a long, shrill whistle.  \"That'll bring him\r\nif he's within ear-shot.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the well-known sound broke upon Chimo's ear, he was lying coiled up\r\nin front of the kitchen fire, being privileged to do so in consequence\r\nof his position as Edith's favourite.  The cook, having gone out a few\r\nminutes previously, had left Chimo to enjoy his slumbers in solitude, so\r\nthat, when he started suddenly to his feet on hearing Frank's whistle,\r\nhe found himself a prisoner.  But Chimo was a peculiarly strong-minded\r\nand strong-bodied dog, and was possessed of an iron will!  He was of the\r\nEsquimau breed, and bore some resemblance to the Newfoundland, but was\r\nrather shorter in the legs, longer in the body, and more powerfully\r\nmade.  Moreover, he was more shaggy, and had a stout, blunt,\r\nstraightforward appearance, which conveyed to the beholder the idea that\r\nhe scorned flattery, and would not consent to be petted on any\r\nconsideration.  Indeed this was the case, for he always turned away with\r\nquiet contempt from any of the men who attempted to fondle him.  He made\r\nan exception, however, of little Edith, whom he not only permitted to\r\nclap him to any extent, but deliberately invited her to do so by laying\r\nhis great head in her lap, rubbing himself against her, and wagging his\r\nbushy tail, as if to say, \"Now, little girl, do what you will with me!\"\r\nAnd Eda never refused the animal's dumb-show request.  When she was very\r\nyoung and had not much sense--at which time Chimo was young too, but\r\npossessed of a great deal of sense--she formed a strong affection for\r\nthe Esquimau dog, an affection which she displayed by putting her little\r\narms round his neck and hugging him until he felt a tendency to\r\nsuffocation; she also pulled his ears and tail, and stuffed her fat\r\nlittle hands into his eyes and mouth,--all of which dreadful actions she\r\nseemed to think, in her childish ignorance, must be very pleasant to\r\nChimo, and all of which the dog appeared really to enjoy.  At all\r\nevents, whether he liked it or not, he came regularly to have himself\r\nthus treated every day.  As Eda grew older she left off choking her\r\nfavourite and poking out his eyes, and contented herself with caressing\r\nhim.  Chimo also evinced a partiality for Mr Stanley and Frank Morton,\r\nand often accompanied the latter on his hunting excursions; but he\r\nalways comported himself towards them with dignified hauteur, accepting\r\ntheir caresses with a slight wag of acknowledgment, but never courting\r\ntheir favour.\r\n\r\nOn jumping up, as we have already said, and observing that the door was\r\nshut, the dog looked slowly and calmly round the apartment, as if to\r\ndecide on what was best to be done; for Chimo was a dog of great energy\r\nof character, and was never placed in any circumstances in which he did\r\nnot pursue some decided course of action.  On the present occasion there\r\nwas not a hole, except the key-hole, by which he could hope to make his\r\nescape.  Yes, by-the-bye, there was a hole in the window, which was made\r\nof parchment; but as that was merely the bullet-hole through which the\r\nanimal that had given his skin for a window had been shot, and was not\r\nlarger than a shilling, it did not afford much hope.  Nevertheless Chimo\r\nregarded it with a steady gaze for a minute or two, then he turned to\r\nthe fire, and having satisfied himself that the chimney was\r\nimpracticable, being full of flames and smoke, he faced the window once\r\nmore, and showed his teeth, as if in chagrin.\r\n\r\n\"Whew-ew!  Chimo-o-o!\" came Frank's voice, floating faintly from afar.\r\nChimo took aim at the bullet-hole.  One vigorous bound--a horrible\r\ncrash, that nearly caused the returning cook to faint--and the dog was\r\nfree.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, here he comes!--good dog!\" cried Frank, as the animal came bounding\r\nover intervening obstacles towards the canoes.  Chimo made straight for\r\nthe small canoe, in answer to his master's call; but, like many dogs and\r\nnot a few men, he owned a higher power than that of a master.  The voice\r\nof his little mistress sounded sweetly in his ear, like the sound of a\r\nsilver bell.  \"O Chimo, Chimo! my darling pet! come here--here.\"  It was\r\na soft, tiny voice at the loudest, and was quite drowned amid the\r\ntalking and laughter of the men, but Chimo heard it.  Turning at a sharp\r\nangle from his course, he swept past the light canoe, and bounding into\r\nthat of Mr Stanley, lay down beside Eda and placed his head in her lap,\r\nwhere it was immediately smothered in the caresses of its young\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nMr Stanley smiled and patted his little girl on the shoulder, as he\r\nsaid, \"That's right, Eda; the love of a faithful dog is worth having and\r\ncherishing.\"  Then turning towards the stern of the canoe, where Massan\r\nstood erect, with his steering paddle ready for action, he said to that\r\nworthy--\r\n\r\n\"Now, Massan, all ready; give the word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho, ho, boys; forward!\"\r\n\r\nThe paddles dipped simultaneously in the water with a loud, gurgling\r\nsound; the two large canoes shot out into the stream abreast of each\r\nother, preceded by the light one, which, urged forward by the powerful\r\narms of Frank and the two Indians, led the way among the floating fields\r\nof ice.  The people on shore took off their caps and waved a last\r\nfarewell.  Dick Prince, who possessed a deep, loud, sonorous voice,\r\nbegan one of those beautiful and wild yet plaintive songs peculiar to\r\nthe _voyageurs_ of the wilderness.  The men joined, with a full, rich\r\nswell, in the chorus, as they darted forward with arrow-like speed--and\r\nthe voyage began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER PARTIALLY DEVELOPED--DUCKS FOR SUPPER--A THREATENED \"NIP\"--\r\nBUNDLED OUT ON THE ICE.\r\n\r\nFortunately the wind veered round to the south-east soon after the\r\ndeparture of the canoes from Moose Fort, and although there was not\r\nenough of it to ruffle the surface of the river, it had the effect of\r\nchecking the influx of ice from James's Bay.  The tide, too, began to\r\nebb, so that the progress of the canoes was even more rapid than it\r\nappeared to be; and long before the sun set, they were past the point at\r\nthe mouth of the river, and coasting along the shores of the salt ocean.\r\n\r\nOutside of them the sea was covered with hummocks and fields of ice,\r\nsome of which ever and anon met in the cross currents caused by the\r\nriver, with a violent shock.  Close to the shore, however, the thickness\r\nof the ice caused it to strand, leaving a lane of open water, along\r\nwhich the canoes proceeded easily, the depth of water being much more\r\nthan sufficient for them, as the largest canoe did not draw more than a\r\nfoot.  Sometimes, however, this space was blocked up by smaller\r\nfragments, and considerable difficulty was experienced in steering the\r\ncanoes amongst them.  Had the party travelled in boats, they would have\r\neasily dashed through many of these checks; but with canoes it is far\r\notherwise.  Not only are their bark sides easily broken, but the seams\r\nare covered with a kind of pitch which becomes so brittle in ice-cold\r\nwater that it chips off in large lumps with the slightest touch.  For\r\nthe sea, therefore, boats are best; but when it comes to carrying the\r\ncraft over waterfalls and up mountain sides, for days and weeks\r\ntogether, canoes are more useful, owing to their lightness.\r\n\r\n\"Take care, Massan,\" said Mr Stanley, on approaching one of these\r\nfloes.  \"Don't chip the gum off if you can help it.  If we spring a\r\nleak, we shan't spend our first night on a pleasant camping-ground, for\r\nthe shore just hereabouts does not look inviting.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear, sir,\" replied Massan.  \"Dick Prince is in the bow, and as long\r\nas his mouth's shut I keep my mind easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You appear to have unlimited confidence in Prince,\" said Stanley, with\r\na smile.  \"Does he never fail in anything, that you are so sure of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fail!\" exclaimed the steersman, whose paddle swept constantly in a\r\ncircle round his head, while he changed it from side to side as the\r\nmotions of the canoe required--\"fail! ay, that does he sometimes.\r\nMortal man must get on the wrong side o' luck now and then.  I've seen\r\nDick Prince fail, but I never saw him make a mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've no doubt that he deserves your good opinion.  Nevertheless,\r\nbe more than ordinarily careful.  If you had a wife and child in the\r\ncanoe, Massan, you would understand my anxiety better.\"  Stanley smiled\r\nas he said this, and the worthy steersman replied in a grave tone,--\"I\r\nhave the wife and child of my bourgeois under my care.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, true, Massan,\" said Stanley, lying back on his couch and\r\nconversing with his wife in an undertone.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis curious,\" said he, \"to observe the confidence that Massan has in\r\nPrince; and yet it would be difficult to say wherein consists the\r\nsuperiority of the one over the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it is the influence of a strong mind over a weaker,\" suggested\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n\"It may be so.  Yet Prince is an utterly uneducated man.  True, he\r\nshoots a hair's-breadth better than Massan; but he is not a better\r\ncanoe-man, neither is he more courageous, and he is certainly less\r\npowerful: nevertheless Massan looks up to him and speaks of him as if he\r\nwere greatly his superior.  The secret of his power must lie in that\r\nsteady, never-wavering inflexibility of purpose, that characterises our\r\ngood bowman in everything he does.\"\r\n\r\n\"Papa,\" said Edith, who had been holding a long conversation with Chimo\r\non the wonders of the scene around them--if we may call that a\r\nconversation where the one party does all the talking and the other all\r\nthe listening--\"papa, where shall we all sleep to-night?\"\r\n\r\nThe thought seemed to have struck her for the first time, and she looked\r\nup eagerly for an answer, while Chimo gave a deep sigh of indifference,\r\nand went to sleep, or pretended to do so, where he was.\r\n\r\n\"In the woods, Eda.  How do you think you will like it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure I shall like it very much,\" replied the little one.  \"I've\r\noften wished to live in the woods altogether like the Indians, and do\r\nnothing but wander about and pull berries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Jessie,\" said Stanley, \"what an idle little baggage your daughter\r\nis!  I fear she's a true chip of the old block!\"\r\n\r\n\"Which do you consider the old block,\" retorted Mrs Stanley--\"you or\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, wife; we'll leave that an open question.--But tell me, Eda,\r\ndon't you think that wandering about and pulling berries would be a very\r\nuseless sort of life?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Edith, gravely.  \"Mamma often tells me that God wants me\r\nto be happy, and I'm quite sure that wandering about all day in the\r\nbeautiful woods would make me happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my darling,\" said Stanley, smiling at the simplicity of this\r\nplausible argument in favour of an idle life, \"don't you know that we\r\nought to try to make others happy too, as well as ourselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" replied Eda, with a bright smile, \"I know that, papa; and I\r\nwould try to make everybody happy by going with them and showing them\r\nwhere the finest flowers and berries were to be found; and so we would\r\nall be happy together, and that's what God wants, is it not?\"\r\n\r\nMr Stanley glanced towards his wife with an arch smile.  \"There,\r\nJessie, what think you of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, husband, what think you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" he replied in an undertone, \"that your sagacious teaching\r\nagainst idleness, and in favour of diligence and attention to duty, and\r\nso forth, has not taken very deep root yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"And _I_ think,\" said Mrs Stanley, \"that however wise you men may be in\r\nsome things, you are all most incomprehensibly stupid in regard to the\r\ndevelopment of young minds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care now, Jessie; you're verging upon metaphysics.  But you have\r\nonly given me your opinion of men as yet; you have still to say what you\r\nthink of Eda's acknowledged predilection for idleness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Mrs Stanley, \"I think that my sagacious teaching, as\r\nyou are pleased to call it, has taken pretty firm root already, and that\r\nEda's speech is one of the first bright, beautiful blossoms, from which\r\nwe may look for much fruit hereafter; for to make one's self and one's\r\nfellow-creatures happy, _because such is the will of God_, seems to me a\r\nsimple and comprehensive way of stating the whole duty of man.\"\r\n\r\nStanley's eyes opened a little at this definition.  \"Hum! _multum in\r\nparvo_; it may be so,\" he said; and casting down his eyes, he was soon\r\nlost in a profound reverie, while the canoe continued to progress\r\nforward by little impulsive bounds, under the rapid stroke of the\r\npaddles.  Eda rested her fair cheek on the shaggy brow of Chimo, and\r\naccompanied him to the land of nod, until the sun began to sink behind\r\nthe icebergs on the seaward horizon, where a dark line indicated an\r\napproaching breeze.\r\n\r\nMassan cast an uneasy glance at this from time to time.  At length he\r\ncalled to his friend in the bow, \"Hello, Prince! will it come stiff;\r\nthink ye?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Prince, rising and shading his eyes with his hand; \"it'll\r\nbe only a puff; but that's enough to drive the ice down on us, an' shut\r\nup the open water.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's my 'pinion,\" said Massan, \"that we should hold away for the p'int\r\nyonder, an' camp there.\"\r\n\r\nDick Prince nodded assent, and resumed his paddle.\r\n\r\nAs he did so the report of a gun came sharply over the water.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed Stanley, looking out ahead; \"what's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only Mr Frank,\" said Massan; \"he's dowsed two birds.  I see'd them\r\nsplash into the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" said Stanley; \"we shall have something fresh for the\r\nkettle to-night.  And, by the way, we'll need all we can kill, for we\r\nhaven't much provision to depend on, and part of it must be reserved in\r\ncase of accidents, so that if Frank does not do his duty, we shall have\r\nto live on birch bark, Massan.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be rayther tough.  I'm afeerd,\" replied the steersman,\r\nlaughing.  \"I've tried the tail o' a deer-skin coat afore now, an' it\r\nwasn't much to boast of; but I niver tried a birch-bark steak.  I doubt\r\nit would need a power o' chewin?\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the two large canoes had drawn gradually nearer to the\r\nleading one.  As they approached, Frank ordered his men to cease\r\npaddling.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Frank, what success?\" said Stanley, as they came up.\r\n\r\n\"There's our supper,\" cried Frank, tossing a large duck into the canoe;\r\n\"and there's a bite for the men,\" he added, sending a huge gray goose\r\ninto the midst of them.  \"I saw a herd of reindeer on the other side of\r\nthe point; but the ice closed up the passage, and prevented me from\r\ngetting within range.  It will stop our further progress for to-night\r\ntoo; so I waited to advise you to camp here.\"\r\n\r\n\"There it comes!\" cried Dick Prince.  \"Jump out on the ice, lads, and\r\nunload as fast as you can.\"\r\n\r\nAs Dick spoke he sprang on to a field of ice which was attached to the\r\nshore, and drawing the canoe alongside, began hastily to remove the\r\ncargo.  His example was instantly followed by the men, who sprang over\r\nthe gunwales like cats; and in less than five minutes the cargoes were\r\nscattered over the ice.  Meanwhile, the breeze which Massan had observed\r\ncontinued to freshen, and the seaward ice bore rapidly down on the\r\nshore, gradually narrowing and filling up the lanes of water among which\r\nthe travellers had been hitherto wending their way.  Dick Prince's\r\nsudden action was caused by his observing a large, solid field, which\r\nbore down on them with considerable rapidity.  His warning was just in\r\ntime, for the goods were scarcely landed and the three canoes lifted out\r\nof the water, when the ice closed in with a crash that would have ground\r\nthe frail barks to pieces, and the passage was closed up.  So completely\r\nwas every trace of water obliterated, that it seemed as though there\r\nnever had been any there before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nSHOWS HOW THE PARTY MADE THEMSELVES AT HOME IN THE BUSH--TALK ROUND THE\r\nCAMP FIRE--A FLASH OF TEMPER--TURNING IN.\r\n\r\nThe spot where they were thus suddenly arrested in their progress was a\r\nsmall bay, formed by a low point which jutted from the mainland, and\r\nshut out the prospect in advance.  There was little or no wood on the\r\npoint, except a few stunted willows, which being green and small would\r\nnot, as La Roche the cook remarked, \"make a fire big enough to roast the\r\nwing of a mosquito.\"  There was no help for it, however.  The spot on\r\nwhich Massan had resolved to encamp for the night was three miles on the\r\nother side of the point, and as the way was now solid ice instead of\r\nwater, there was no possibility of getting there until a change of wind\r\nshould drive the ice off the shore.  Moreover, it was now getting dark,\r\nand it behoved them to make their preparations with as much speed as\r\npossible.  Accordingly, Massan and Prince shouldered one canoe, Francois\r\nand Gaspard carried the other, and the light one was placed on the\r\nshoulders of Bryan the blacksmith; La Roche took the provision-basket\r\nand cooking utensils under his special charge; while the three Esquimau\r\ninterpreters and the two Indian guides busied themselves in carrying the\r\nmiscellaneous goods and baggage into camp.  As for Chimo, he seated\r\nhimself quietly on a lump of ice, and appeared to superintend the entire\r\nproceedings; while his young mistress and her mother, accompanied by\r\nFrank and Stanley, crossed the ice to the shore, to select a place for\r\ntheir encampment.\r\n\r\nBut it was some time ere a suitable place could be found, as the point\r\nhappened to be low and swampy, and poor Eda's first experience of a life\r\nin the woods was stepping into a hole which took her up to the knees in\r\nmud and water.  She was not alone, however, in misfortune, for just at\r\nthe same moment Bryan passed through the bushes with his canoe, and\r\nstaggered into the same swamp, exclaiming as he did so, in a rich brogue\r\nwhich many years' residence among the French half-breeds of Rupert's\r\nLand had failed to soften, \"Thunder an' turf! such a blackguard counthry\r\nI niver did see.  Och, Bryan dear, why did ye iver lave yer native\r\nland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pourquoi, why, mon boy? for ver' goot raison,\" cried La Roche, in a\r\nhorrible compound of French and broken English, as he skipped lightly\r\npast, with a loud laugh, \"for ver' goot raison--dey was tired of you to\r\nhome, vraiment.  You was too grande raskale; dey could not keep you no\r\nlonger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thrue for ye, La Roche,\" replied the blacksmith, \"thrue for ye, boy;\r\nthey sartinly could not keep me on nothin', an' as the murphies was all\r\nsp'iled wi' the rot, I had to lave or starve.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, after a long search, Frank Morton found a spot pretty well\r\nadapted for their purpose.  It was an elevated plot of gravel, which was\r\ncovered with a thin carpet of herbage, and surrounded by a belt of\r\nwillows which proved a sufficient shelter against the wind.  A low and\r\nrather shaggy willow-tree spread its branches over the spot, and gave to\r\nit a good deal of the feeling and appearance of shelter, if not much of\r\nthe reality.  This was of little consequence, however, as the night\r\nproved fine and comparatively mild, so that the black vault of heaven,\r\nspangled with hosts of brilliant stars, amply compensated for the want\r\nof a leafy canopy.\r\n\r\nUnder the willow-tree, Frank and La Roche busied themselves in spreading\r\na very small white tent for Mr Stanley and his family.  Frank himself,\r\nalthough entitled from his position in the Company's service to the\r\nluxury of a tent, scorned to use one, preferring to rough it like the\r\nmen, and sleep beneath the shelter of the small canoe.  Meanwhile, Mr\r\nStanley proceeded to strike a light with his flint and steel; and Bryan,\r\nhaving deposited his burden near the tent, soon collected a sufficiency\r\nof driftwood to make a good fire.  Edith and her mother were not idle in\r\nthe midst of this busy scene.  They collected a few bundles of dried\r\ntwigs to make the fire light more easily, and after the blaze was\r\ncasting its broad glare of light over the camp, and the tent was\r\npitched, they assisted La Roche in laying the cloth for supper.  Of\r\ncourse, in a journey like this, none but necessary articles were taken,\r\nand these were of the most homely character.  The kettle was the\r\ntea-pot, the cups were tin pannikins, and the table-cloth was a large\r\ntowel, while the table itself was the ground, from the damp of which,\r\nhowever, the party in the tent were protected by an ample oil-cloth.\r\n\r\nWhen all the things were carried up, and the men assembled, the camp\r\npresented the following appearance: in the centre of the open space,\r\nwhich nature had arranged in the form of a circle, blazed the fire; and\r\na right jovial, sputtering, outrageous fire it was, sending its sparks\r\nflying in all directions, like the artillery of a beleaguered fortress\r\nin miniature, and rolling its flames about in fierce and wayward\r\ntongues, that seemed bent on licking in and swallowing up the entire\r\nparty, but more especially La Roche, who found no little difficulty in\r\npaying due attention to his pots and kettles.  Sometimes the flames\r\nroared fiercely upwards, singeing off the foliage of the overhanging\r\nwillow as they went, and then, bursting away from their parent fire,\r\nportions of them floated off for a few seconds on the night air.  On the\r\nweather side of this fire stood Mr Stanley's tent, under the\r\nwillow-tree, as before described, its pure white folds showing strongly\r\nagainst the darkness of the sky beyond.  The doorway, or curtain of the\r\ntent, was open, displaying the tea-equipage within, and the smiling\r\ncountenances of Stanley and his wife, Frank and Eda, who, seated on\r\nblankets and shawls around the towel, were preparing to make an assault\r\non the fat duck before mentioned.  This duck had been split open and\r\nroasted on a piece of stick before the blaze, and now stood with the\r\nstumps of its wings and legs extended, as if demanding urgently to be\r\neaten--a demand which Chimo, who crouched near the doorway, could scarce\r\nhelp complying with.\r\n\r\nTo the right of the tent was placed the small canoe, bottom up, so as to\r\nafford a partial protection to the bedding which Oostesimow was engaged\r\nin spreading out for Frank and himself and his comrade Ma-Istequan.\r\nFacing this, at the other side of the fire, and on the left of the tent,\r\nthe largest canoe was turned up in a similar manner, and several of the\r\nmen were engaged in covering the ground beneath it with a layer of\r\nleaves and branches, above which they spread their blankets; while\r\nothers lounged around the fire and smoked their beloved pipes, or\r\nwatched with impatient eyes the operations of Bryan, who, being\r\naccustomed to have familiar dealings with the fire, had been deemed\r\nworthy of holding the office of cook to the men, and was inducted\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nIt is due to Bryan to say that he fully merited the honour conferred\r\nupon him; for never, since the days of Vulcan, was there a man seen who\r\ncould daringly dabble in the fire as he did.  He had a peculiar\r\nsleight-of-hand way of seizing hold of and tossing about red-hot coals\r\nwith his naked hand, that induced one to believe he must be made of\r\nleather.  Flames seemed to have no effect whatever on his sinewy arms\r\nwhen they licked around them; and as for smoke, he treated it with\r\nbenign contempt.  Not so La Roche: with the mercurial temperament of his\r\nclass he leaped about the fire, during his culinary operations, in a way\r\nthat afforded infinite amusement to his comrades, and not unfrequently\r\nbrought him into violent collision with Bryan, who usually received him\r\non such occasions with a strong Irish growl, mingled with a disparaging\r\nor contemptuous remark.\r\n\r\nBeyond the circle of light thrown by the fire was the belt of willows\r\nwhich encompassed the camp on all sides except towards the sea, where a\r\nnarrow gap formed a natural entrance and afforded a glimpse of the ocean\r\nwith its fields and hummocks of ice floating on its calm bosom and\r\nglancing in the faint light of the moon, which was then in its first\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n\"How comfortable and snug everything is!\" said Mrs Stanley, as she\r\npoured out the tea, while her husband carved the duck.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, isn't it, Eda?\" said Frank, patting his favourite on the head, as\r\nhe held out her plate for a wing.  \"There, give her a bit of the breast\r\ntoo,\" he added.  \"I know she's ravenously hungry, for I saw her looking\r\nat Chimo, just before we landed, as if she meant to eat him for supper\r\nwithout waiting to have him cooked.\"\r\n\r\n\"O Frank, how can you be so wicked?\" said Eda, taking up her knife and\r\nfork and attacking the wing with so much energy as almost to justify her\r\nfriend's assertion.\r\n\r\n\"Snug, said you, Jessie? yes, that's the very word to express it,\" said\r\nStanley.  \"There's no situation that I know of (and I wasn't born\r\nyesterday) that is so perfectly snug, and in all respects comfortable,\r\nas an encampment in the woods on a fine night in spring or autumn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or winter,\" added Frank, swallowing a pannikin of tea at a draught,\r\nnodding to Chimo, as much as to say, \"Do that if you can, old fellow,\"\r\nand handing it to Mrs Stanley to be replenished.  \"Don't omit winter--\r\ncold, sharp, sunny winter.  An encampment in the snow, in fine weather,\r\nis as snug as this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather cold, is it not?\" said Mrs Stanley.\r\n\r\n\"Cold! not a bit,\" replied Frank, making a reckless dive with his hand\r\ninto the biscuit-bag; \"if you have enough wood to get up a roaring fire,\r\nsix feet long by three broad and four deep, with a bank of snow five\r\nfeet high all around ye, a pine-tree with lots of thick branches\r\nspreading overhead to keep off the snow, and two big green blankets to\r\nkeep out the frost--(another leg of that widgeon, please)--you've no\r\nnotion how snug it is, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum!\" ejaculated Stanley, with a dubious smile, \"you forgot to add--a\r\nyouthful, robust frame, with the blood careering through the veins like\r\nwildfire, to your catalogue of requisites.  No doubt it is pleasant\r\nenough in its way; but commend me to spring or autumn for thorough\r\nenjoyment, when the air is mild, and the waters flowing, and the woods\r\ngreen and beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you speak of summer, papa?\" said Eda, who had been listening\r\nintently to this conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Summer, my pet! because--\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to explain,\" interrupted Frank, laying down his knife and\r\nfork, and placing the forefinger of his right hand in his left palm, as\r\nif he were about to make a speech.  \"Because, Eda, because there is such\r\na thing as heat--long-continued, never-ending, sweltering heat.  Because\r\nthere are such reprehensible and unutterably detestable insects as\r\nmosquitoes, and sand-flies, and bull-dogs; and there is such a thing as\r\nbeing bitten, and stung, and worried, and sucked into a sort of partial\r\nmadness; and I have seen such sights as men perpetually slapping their\r\nown faces, and scratching the skin off their own cheeks with their own\r\nnails, and getting no relief thereby, but rather making things worse;\r\nand I have, moreover, seen men's heads swelled until the eyes and noses\r\nwere lost, and the mouths only visible when opened, and their general\r\naspect like that of a Scotch haggis; and there is a time when all this\r\naccumulates on man and beast till the latter takes to the water in\r\ndesperation, and the former takes to intermittent insanity, and that\r\ntime is--_summer_.--Another cup, please, Mrs Stanley.  'Pon my\r\nconscience, it creates thirst to think of it.\"\r\n\r\nAt this stage the conversation of the party in the tent was interrupted\r\nby a loud peal of laughter mingled with not a few angry exclamations\r\nfrom the men.  La Roche, in one of his frantic leaps to avoid a tongue\r\nof flame which shot out from the fire with a vicious velocity towards\r\nhis eyes, came into violent contact with Bryan while that worthy was in\r\nthe act of lifting a seething kettle of soup and boiled pork from the\r\nfire.  Fortunately for the party whose supper was thus placed in\r\njeopardy, Bryan stood his ground; but La Roche, tripping over a log,\r\nfell heavily among the pannikins, tin plates, spoons, and knives, which\r\nhad been just laid out on the ground in front of the canoe.\r\n\r\n\"Ach! mauvais chien,\" growled Gaspard, as he picked up and threw away\r\nthe fragments of his pipe, \"you're always cuttin' and jumpin' about like\r\na monkey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! pauvre crapaud,\" cried Francois, laughing; \"don't abuse him,\r\nGaspard.  He's a useful dog in his way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tare an' ages! you've done it now, ye have.  Bad luck to ye! wasn't I\r\nfor iver tellin' ye that same.  Shure, if it wasn't that ye're no bigger\r\nor heavier than a wisp o' pea straw, ye'd have druve me and the soup\r\ninto the fire, ye would.  Be the big toe o' St. Patrick, not to mintion\r\nhis riverince the Pope--\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, Bryan,\" cried Massan, \"don't speak ill o' the Pope, an'\r\ndown wi' the kettle.\"\r\n\r\n\"The kittle, is it?  Sorra a kittle ye'll touch, Massan, till it's cool\r\nenough to let us all start fair at wance.  Ye've got yer mouth and\r\nthroat lined wi' brass, I believe, an' would ate the half o't before a\r\nsoul of us could taste it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't insult me, you red-faced racoon,\" retorted Massan, while he and\r\nhis comrades circled round the kettle, and began a vigorous attack on\r\nthe scalding mess; \"my throat is not so used to swallowin' fire as your\r\nown.  I never knowed a man that payed into the grub as you do.--Bah! how\r\nhot it is.--I say, Oolibuck, doesn't it remember you o' the dogs o' yer\r\nown country, when they gits the stone kettle to clean out?\"\r\n\r\nOolibuck's broad visage expanded with a chuckle as he lifted an enormous\r\nwooden spoonful of soup to his ample mouth.  \"Me tink de dogs of de\r\nInnuit [Esquimaux] make short work of dis kettle if 'e had 'im.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do the dogs of the Huskies eat with their masters?\" inquired Francois,\r\nas he groped in the kettle with his fork in search of a piece of pork.\r\n\r\n\"Dey not eat _wid_ der masters, but dey al'ays clean hout de kettle,\"\r\nreplied Moses, somewhat indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed Massan, pausing for a few minutes to recover breath;\r\n\"yes, they always let the dogs finish off the feast.  Ye must know,\r\ncomrades, that I've seed them do it myself--anyways I've seed a man that\r\nknew a feller who said he had a comrade that wintered once with the\r\nHuskies, which is pretty much the same thing.  An' he said that\r\nsometimes when they kill a big seal, they boil it whole an' have a\r\nrig'lar feast.  Ye must understand, mes garcons, that the Huskies make\r\nthumpin' big kettles out o' a kind o' soft stone they find in them\r\nparts, an' some o' them's big enough to boil a whole seal in.  Well,\r\nwhen the beast is cooked, they take it out o' the pot, an' while they're\r\ntuckin' into it, the dogs come and sit in a ring round the pot to wait\r\ntill the soup's cool enough to eat.  They knows well that it's too hot\r\nat first, an' that they must have a deal o' patience; but afore long\r\nsome o' the young uns can't hold on, so they steps up somewhat desperate\r\nlike, and pokes their snouts in.  Of course they pulls them out pretty\r\nsharp with a yell, and sit down to rub their noses for a bit longer.\r\nThen the old uns take courage an' make a snap at it now and again, but\r\nvery tenderly, till it gits cooler at last, an' then at it they go,\r\nworryin', an' scufflin', an' barkin', an' gallopin', just like Moses\r\nthere, till the pot's as clean as the day it wos made.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha! oh, ver' goot, tres bien; ah! mon coeur, just tres\r\nsplendiferous!\" shouted La Roche, whose risibility was always easily\r\ntickled.\r\n\r\n\"It's quite true, though--isn't it, Moses?\" said Massan, as he once more\r\napplied to the kettle, while some of his comrades cut up the goose that\r\nFrank had shot in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Moses, what a capacity you have for grub!\" said Francois.  \"If\r\nyour countrymen are anything like you, I don't wonder that they have\r\nboiled seals and whales for dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll take a screamin' kittle for a whale,\" spluttered Bryan, with his\r\nmouth full, \"an' a power o' dogs to drink the broth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You tink you funny, Bryan,\" retorted Moses, while an oily smile beamed\r\non his fat, good-humoured countenance; \"but you not; you most dreadful\r\nstupid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thrue for ye, Moses; I was oncommon stupid to let you sit so long\r\nbeside the kittle,\" replied the Irishman, as he made a futile effort to\r\nscrape another spoonful from the bottom of it.  \"Och! but ye've licked\r\nit as clane as one of yer own dogs could ha' done it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mind your eye!\" growled Gaspard, at the same time giving La Roche a\r\nviolent push, as that volatile worthy, in one of his eccentric\r\nmovements, nearly upset his can of water.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! pardon, monsieur,\" exclaimed La Roche, in pretended sorrow, at the\r\nsame time making a grotesque bow that caused a general peal of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Why, one might as well travel with a sick bear as with you, Gaspard,\"\r\nsaid Francois half angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your jaw,\" replied Gaspard.\r\n\r\n\"Not at your bidding,\" retorted Francois, half rising from his reclining\r\nposture, while his colour heightened.  Gaspard had also started up, and\r\nit seemed as if the little camp were in danger of becoming a scene of\r\nstrife, when Dick Prince, who was habitually silent and unobtrusive,\r\npreferring generally to listen rather than to speak, laid his hand on\r\nGaspard's broad shoulder and pulled him somewhat forcibly to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Shame on you, comrades!\" he said, in a low, grave voice, that instantly\r\nproduced a dead silence; \"shame on you, to quarrel on our first night in\r\nthe bush!  We've few enough friends in these parts, I think, that we\r\nshould make enemies o' each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's well said,\" cried Massan, in a very decided tone.  \"It won't do\r\nto fall out when there's so few of us.\"  And the stout voyageur thrust\r\nhis foot against the logs on the fire, causing a rich cloud of sparks to\r\nascend, as if to throw additional light on his remark.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, mes comrades,\" cried Francois; \"I did not intend to\r\nquarrel;\" and he extended his hand to Gaspard, who took it in silence,\r\nand dropping back again to his recumbent posture, resumed his pipe.\r\n\r\nThis little scene was witnessed by the party in the tent, who were near\r\nenough to overhear all that was said by the men, and even to converse\r\nwith them if they should desire to do so.  A shade of anxiety crossed\r\nMr Stanley's countenance, and some time after, recurring to the\r\nsubject, he said--\r\n\r\n\"I don't feel quite easy about that fellow Gaspard.  He seems a sulky\r\ndog, and is such a Hercules that he might give us a deal of trouble if\r\nhe were high-spirited.\"\r\n\r\nA slight smile of contempt curled Frank's lip as he said, \"A strong arm\r\nwithout a bold heart is not of more value than that of my Eda here in\r\nthe hour of danger.  But I think better of Gaspard than you seem to do.\r\nHe's a sulky enough dog, 'tis true; but he is a good, hard worker, and\r\ndoes not grumble; and I sometimes have noticed traces of a better spirit\r\nthan usually meets the eye.  As for his bulk, I think nothing of it; he\r\nwants high spirit to make it available.  Francois could thrash him any\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so,\" replied Stanley; \"I hope they won't try their mettle on\r\neach other sooner than we expect.  Not that I care a whit for any of the\r\nmen having a round or two now and then and be done with it; but this\r\nfellow seems to `nurse his wrath to keep it warm.'  On such an\r\nexpedition as ours, it behoves us to have a good understanding and a\r\nkindly feeling in the camp.  One black sheep in the flock may do much\r\ndamage.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's only piebald, not black,\" said Frank, laughing, as he rose to quit\r\nthe tent.  \"But I must leave you.  I see that Eda's eyes are refusing to\r\nkeep open any longer, so good-night to you all, and a sound sleep.\"\r\n\r\nFrank's concluding remarks in reference to him were overheard by\r\nGaspard, who had risen to look at the night, and afterwards kneeled near\r\nthe tent, in order to be at some distance from his comrades while he\r\nsaid his prayers; for, strange though it may seem, many of the rough and\r\nreckless voyageurs of that country, most of whom are Roman Catholics,\r\nregularly retire each night to kneel and pray beneath a tree before\r\nlying down on their leafy couches, and deem the act quite consistent\r\nwith the swearing and quarrelling life that too many of them lead.  Such\r\nis human nature.  As Gaspard rose from his knees Frank's words fell upon\r\nhis ear, and when he drew his blanket over his head that night there was\r\na softer spot in his heart and a wrinkle less on his brow.\r\n\r\nWhen Frank stepped over to the place where his canoe lay, the aspect of\r\nthe camp was very different from what it had been an hour before.  The\r\nfire had burned low, and was little more than a mass of glowing embers,\r\nfrom which a fitful flame shot forth now and then, casting a momentary\r\nglare on the forms of the men, who, having finished their pipes, were\r\nall extended in a row, side by side, under the large canoe.  As they\r\npossessed only a single green blanket each, they had to make the most of\r\ntheir coverings, by rolling them tightly around their bodies, and\r\ndoubling the ends down under their feet and over their heads; so that\r\nthey resembled a row of green bolsters, all their feet being presented\r\ntowards the fire, and all their heads resting on their folded capotes.\r\nA good deal of loud and regular snoring proved that toil and robust\r\nhealth seldom court the drowsy god long in vain.  Turning to his own\r\ncanoe, Frank observed that his Indian friends were extended out under\r\nit, with a wide space between them, in which his own bedding was neatly\r\narranged.  The grave sons of the forest had lain down to rest long\r\nbefore their white comrades, and they now lay as silent and motionless\r\nas the canoe that covered their heads.  Being a small canoe, it did not\r\nafford protection to their legs and feet; but in fine weather this was\r\nof no consequence, and for the morrow they cared not.\r\n\r\nBefore lying down Frank kneeled to commend himself and his comrades to\r\nthe protection of God; then stirring up the embers of the fire, he\r\npulled out a small Bible from his breast pocket and sat down on a log to\r\nread.  Frank was a careless, rollicking, kind-hearted fellow, and how\r\nmuch there was of true religion in these acts none but himself could\r\ntell.  But the _habit_ of reading the Word, and of prayer, had been\r\ninstilled into him from infancy by a godly mother, and he carried it\r\nwith him into the wilderness.\r\n\r\nWhen he drew his blanket over him and laid his head on his capote the\r\nstars were still twinkling, and the moon still sailed in a clear sky and\r\ngave silver edges to the ice upon the sea.  All was calm and solemn and\r\nbeautiful, and it seemed as if it could never be otherwise in such a\r\ntranquil scene.  But nature does not always smile.  Appearances are\r\noften deceitful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nBRYAN'S ADVENTURE WITH A POLAR BEAR, ETCETERA.\r\n\r\nIce, ice, ice! everything seemed to have been converted into ice when\r\nthe day broke on the following morning and awoke the sleepers in the\r\ncamp.  A sharp frost during the night, accompanied by a fall of snow,\r\nhad, as if by magic, converted spring into winter.  Icy particles hung\r\nupon and covered, not only the young leaves and buds of the bushes, but\r\nthe branches also, giving to them a white and extremely airy appearance.\r\nSnow lay on the upper sides of the canoes, and weighed heavily on the\r\ntent, causing its folds, once seemingly so pure and white, to look dirty\r\nby contrast.  Snow lay on the protruding legs of the men, and encircled\r\nthe black spot where rested the ashes of last night's brilliant fire.\r\nIce grated on the pebbles of the shore; ice floated on the sea; icy\r\nhummocks and mounds rose above its surface; and icebergs raised their\r\npinnacles on the far-off horizon, and cut sharply into the bright blue\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nIt was cold, but it was not cheerless; for when Eda put out her head at\r\nthe curtain doorway of the tent, and opened her eyes upon the magic\r\nscene, the sun's edge rose above the horizon, as if to greet her, and\r\nsent a flood of light far and near through the spacious universe,\r\nconverting the sea into glass, with islands of frosted silver on its\r\nbosom.  It was a gorgeous scene, worthy of its great Creator, who in His\r\nmysterious working scatters gems of beauty oftentimes in places where\r\nthere is scarce a single human eye to behold their excellence.\r\n\r\nAlthough the sea was covered with ice, there were, nevertheless, several\r\nlanes of open water not far from the shore; so that when Stanley called\r\na council, composed of Frank Morton, Dick Prince, and Massan, it was\r\nagreed unanimously that they should attempt to proceed.  And it was well\r\nthat they did so; for they had not advanced many miles, winding their\r\nway cautiously among the canals of open water, when they doubled a\r\npromontory, beyond which there was little or no ice to be seen, merely a\r\nfew scattered fragments and fields, that served to enhance the beauty of\r\nthe scene by the airy lightness of their appearance in contrast with the\r\nbright blue of the sea and sky, but did not interrupt the progress of\r\nthe travellers.  The three canoes always maintained their relative\r\npositions during the journey as much as possible.  That is to say, Frank\r\nand the two Indians went first in the small canoe, to lead the way,\r\nwhile the two large canoes kept abreast of each other when the open\r\nwater was wide enough to permit of their doing so.  This, besides being\r\nmore sociable, enabled the two crews to join in the chorus of those\r\nbeautiful songs with which they frequently enlivened the voyage.\r\n\r\nDuring all this day, and for many days following, they continued to\r\nenjoy fine weather and to make rapid progress.  Sometimes the ice was\r\npretty thick, and once or twice they narrowly escaped being nipped by\r\ncollapsing masses, which caused them to jump out, hastily throw the\r\nbaggage on the ice, and haul the canoes out of the water.  On these\r\noccasions the men proved themselves to be sterling fellows, nearly all\r\nof them being cool, prompt, and collected in the moment of danger.  No\r\ndoubt there were exceptions.  La Roche, when any sudden crisis of danger\r\narose, usually threw himself blindly over the side of the canoe on to\r\nthe ice with the lightness and agility of a harlequin.  He recked not\r\nwhether he came down on his head or his feet, and more than once nearly\r\nbroke his neck in consequence of his precipitancy.  But La Roche was no\r\ncoward, and the instant the first burst of excitement was over he rushed\r\nto render effective assistance.  Bryan, too, although not so mercurial\r\nas La Roche, was apt to lose self-command for about five minutes when\r\nany sudden danger assailed him, so that he frequently sat still, staring\r\nwildly straight before him, while the others were actively unloading the\r\ncanoes; and once, when the danger was more critical than usual, having\r\nsat till the canoe was empty, and paid no attention to a prompt, gruff\r\norder to jump ashore, he had been seized by the strong arms of Gaspard\r\nand tossed out of the canoe like a puppy dog.  On these occasions he\r\ninvariably endeavoured to make up for his fault by displaying, on\r\nrecovery, the most outrageous and daring amount of unnecessary\r\nrecklessness,--uttering, at the same time, an amazing number of strange\r\nexpressions, among which \"Tare an' ages!\"  \"Och! murder!\" and several\r\nothers less lucid in signification, predominated.  Chimo was always\r\nfirst ashore, and instantly wheeled round to greet Eda, who was also\r\n_always_ second, thanks to the strong and prompt arm of Francois, who\r\nsat just in front, and by tacit agreement took her under his special\r\ncharge.  As for Mrs Stanley, the arm that was rightfully her own, and\r\nhad been her shield in many a scene of danger, proved ever ready and\r\nable to succour the \"first volunteer\" to Ungava.\r\n\r\nAt times the sea was quite free of ice, and many miles were soon added\r\nto the space which separated the little band of adventurers from the\r\nrest of the human world.  Their encampments varied according to the\r\nnature of the coast, being sometimes among pine-trees, or surrounded by\r\ndwarf willows; at other times on the bare sand of the sea-shore; and\r\noccasionally at the extremity of long-projecting capes and promontories,\r\nwhere they had to pitch their tent and make their beds in the clefts of\r\nthe solid rock.  But wherever they laid them down to rest--on the rock,\r\nor on the sand, or within the shade of the forest--it was always found,\r\nas Mrs Stanley remarked of the first night's encampment, that they were\r\nextremely comfortable and eminently snug.\r\n\r\nThey were successful, too, in procuring an ample supply of fresh\r\nprovisions.  There were ducks and geese of various kinds, and\r\ninnumerable quantities of plover, cormorants, gulls, and eider-ducks,\r\nthe eggs of which they found in thousands.  Many of these birds were\r\ngood for food, and the eggs of most of them, especially those of the\r\neider-duck, were excellent.  Reindeer were also met with; and, among\r\nother trophies of his skill as a hunter, Frank one day brought in a\r\nblack bear, parts of which were eaten with great gusto by the Esquimaux\r\nand Indians, to the immense disgust of Bryan, who expressed his belief\r\nthat the \"haythens was barely fit to live,\" and were most justly locked\r\nout from society in \"thim dissolate polar raygeons.\"  There were many\r\nseals, also, in the sea, which put up their ugly, grotesque heads ever\r\nand anon, gazed at the canoes with their huge, fishy eyes, as in\r\nsurprise at the sight of such novel marine monsters, and then sank\r\nslowly beneath the wave.  These animals were never molested, out of\r\nrespect to the feelings of the two Indians, who believed them to be\r\ngods, and assured Stanley that the destruction of one would infallibly\r\nbring down ill-luck and disaster on the heads of the party.  Stanley\r\nsmiled inwardly at this, but gave orders that no seals should be shot--\r\nan order which all were very willing to obey, as they did not require\r\nthe animals either for food or any other purpose.  Several white polar\r\nbears were seen, but they also were spared, as they require a great deal\r\nof shot to kill them, if not hit exactly behind the ear; and besides,\r\nneither their bodies nor skins were of any use to the travellers.\r\n\r\nThus all went favourably for a time.  But life is a chequered story, and\r\nthe sun of prosperity does not always shine, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nOne fine morning, as they were paddling cheerfully along in the\r\nneighbourhood of Cape Jones, it struck Mr Stanley that he might prove\r\nthe correctness of his sextant and other instruments before entering\r\nupon the country which to most of the party was _terra incognita_.  This\r\nwas the more necessary that he could not depend on the guidance of\r\nOostesimow and Ma-Istequan, they having travelled only once, long ago,\r\nthrough part of the country, while the latter part of it was totally\r\nunknown to them.  It was one of those beautiful mornings that are\r\npeculiar to arctic regions, when the air is inexpressibly still, and all\r\ninanimate nature seems hushed in profound repose--a repose which is\r\nrather rendered more effective than otherwise by the plaintive cries of\r\nwild-fowl or the occasional puffing of a whale.  There was a peculiar\r\nbrilliancy, too, in the atmosphere, caused by the presence of so many\r\nfields and hummocks of white ice, looming fantastically through a thin,\r\ndry, gauze-like haze, which, while it did not dim the brightness of the\r\nsolar rays, lent an additional charm to every object by shrouding it in\r\na veil of mystery.\r\n\r\nOn passing the point the men ceased rowing, and proceeded to solace\r\nthemselves with a five-minutes' pipe--an indulgence which voyageurs\r\nalways claim as their due after a long spell at the oars or paddles.\r\n\r\n\"Put ashore here, Massan,\" said Stanley, turning to the guide; \"I shall\r\ntake an observation, if possible, and you can set the men to hunt for\r\neggs.  We shall want them, as the larder is rather low just now.\"\r\n\r\nMassan muttered assent, and, shouting to the other canoe to put ashore,\r\nran alongside the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better hail the little canoe,\" said Stanley, as he landed.  \"I\r\nshall want Mr Morton to assist me.\"\r\n\r\nMassan stepped upon an elevated rock, and, shading his eyes with his\r\nhands, looked earnestly ahead where he observed the little canoe almost\r\nbeyond vision, and just going to double a point of land.  Transferring\r\nhis hands to his mouth, he used them as a trumpet, and gave forth a\r\nshout the like of which had never startled the echoes of the place\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use, sir,\" said Massan; \"he's past hearin'.  I'm afeerd that\r\nthey're off in the direction o' the White Bear Hills, in hopes o'\r\ngittin' a shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try again, Massan,\" urged Stanley; \"raise your pipe a little higher.\r\nPerhaps it will reach them.\"\r\n\r\nMassan shook his head.  \"Try it, Bryan,\" he said, turning to the\r\nIrishman, who was sitting on a rock leisurely filling his short, black\r\npipe.\r\n\r\n\"Is it to halloo ye want me?\" replied Bryan, rising.  \"Shure the great\r\ngun of Athlone itself could niver hold a candle to ye, Massan, at\r\nyellin'; but I'll try, anyhow;\" and putting his hands to his mouth he\r\ngave forth a roar compared to which Massan's was nothing.  There was a\r\nsort of crack in the tone of it, however, that was so irresistibly\r\nridiculous that the whole party burst incontinently into a fit of\r\nlaughter.  Loud though it was, it failed to reach the ears of those in\r\nthe little canoe, which in a few seconds doubled the point and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, bad luck to it!\" said Bryan, in disgust; \"the pipe's damaged\r\nintirely.  Small pace to ye, Bob Mahone; for shure it was howlin' and\r\nscreechin' at your wake like a born scrandighowl that broke it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, lad; what remains of it is not bad,\" said Stanley,\r\nlaughing, as he proceeded to open the box containing his scientific\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his wife and Edith wandered along the rocks picking up shells\r\nand pebbles; and the men dispersed, some to smoke and chat, others to\r\nsearch for eggs.  Bryan and La Roche, who were both aspiring geniuses,\r\nand had formed a sort of rough attachment to each other, asked\r\npermission to take a walk to the point ahead, where they would wait for\r\nthe canoes.  Having obtained it, they set off at a good round pace, that\r\nwould have been \"throublesome to kape up,\" as Bryan remarked, \"with\r\npayse in yer shoes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why you come for to jine de company?\" inquired La Roche, as they jogged\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\"Why? bekase I'd nothin' else to do, as the ould song says.  Ye see,\r\nLosh,\" (Bryan had invented a contraction for his friend's name, which he\r\nsaid was \"convanient\")--\"ye see, Losh, there may be more nor wan raison\r\nfor a gintleman lavin' his native land in order to thravel in furrin\r\nparts.  It's thrue I had nothin' in the univarse to do, for I could\r\nniver git work nohow, an' whin I got it I could niver kape it.  I niver\r\ncould onderstan' why, but so it was.  Nivertheless I managed to live\r\nwell enough in the ould cabin wid the murphies--\"\r\n\r\n\"Vat is murphies?\" inquired La Roche.\r\n\r\n\"Bliss yer innocent face, don't ye know it's praties?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis vat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Praties, boy, or pit-taties, if I must be partic'lar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! goot, goot, I understan'--pettitoes.  Oui, oui, ye call him _pomme\r\nde terre_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum! well, as I was sayin', I got on pretty well wid the pumdeterres\r\nan' the pig, but the pig died wan day--choked hisself on a murphy--that\r\nis, a pumbleterre; an' more betoken, it was the last murphy in the\r\nhouse, a powerful big wan that my grandmother had put by for supper.\r\nAfter this ivery thin' wint to smithereens.  The rot came, and I thought\r\nI should have to list for a sodger.  Well, Bob Mahone died o' dhrink and\r\nstarvation, an' we had a beautiful wake; but there was a rig'lar shindy\r\ngot up, an' two or three o' the county p'lice misbehaved themselves, so\r\nI jist floored them all, wan after the other, an' bolted.  Well, I wint\r\nstraight to Dublin, an' there I met wid an ould friend who was the\r\nskipper o' a ship bound for New York.  Says he, `Bryan, will ye go?'\r\nSays I, `Av coorse; 'an 'shure enough I wint, an' got over the say to\r\n'Meriky.'  But I could niver settle down, so, wan way or another, I came\r\nat last to Montreal and jined the Company; an' afther knockin' about in\r\nthe Columbia and Mackenzie's River for some years, I was sint to Moose,\r\nan' here I am, Losh, yer sarvant to command.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goot, ver' goot, mais peculiaire,\" said La Roche, whose intimacy with\r\nthis son of Erin had enabled him to comprehend enough of his jargon to\r\ngrasp the general scope of his discourse.\r\n\r\n\"Av ye mane that lavin' the ould country was _goot_,\" said Bryan,\r\nstooping to pick up a stone and skim it along the smooth surface of the\r\nsea, \"p'raps ye're right; but there's wan thing I niver could make my\r\nmind aisy about,\" and the blacksmith's voice became deep and his face\r\ngrave as he recalled these bygone days.\r\n\r\n\"Vat were dat?\" inquired La Roche.\r\n\r\n\"Why, ye see, Losh, I was so hard druve by the p'lice that I was forced\r\nto lave wid-out sayin' good day to my ould mother, an' they tould me it\r\nalmost broke her heart; but I've had wan or two screeds from the priest\r\nwid her cross at them since, and she's got over it, an' lookin' out for\r\nmy returnin'--bliss her sowl!--an' I've sint her five pounds ivery year\r\nsince I left: so ye see, Losh, I've great hope o' seein' her yit, for\r\nalthough she's ould she's oncommon tough, an' having come o' a\r\nlong-winded stock, I've great hopes o' her.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Bryan! it never entered into his reckless brain to think that,\r\nconsidering the life of almost constant peril he led in the land of his\r\npilgrimage, there was more hope of the longevity of his old mother than\r\nof himself.  Like many of his countrymen, he was a man of strong,\r\npassionate, warm feelings, and remarkably unselfish.\r\n\r\n\"Is your contry resemblance to dat?\" inquired La Roche, pointing, as he\r\nspoke, towards the sea, which was covered with fields and mountains of\r\nice as far out as the eye could discern.\r\n\r\n\"Be the nose o' my great-grandmother (an' that was be no manes a short\r\nwan), no!\" replied Bryan, with a laugh.  \"The say that surrounds ould\r\nIreland is niver covered with sich sugar-plums as these.  But what have\r\nwe here?\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke they reached the point at which they were to await the\r\ncoming up of the canoes, and the object which called forth Bryan's\r\nremark was the little canoe, which lay empty on the beach just beyond\r\nthe point.  From the manner in which it lay it was evident that Frank\r\nand his Indians had placed it there; but there was no sign of their\r\npresence save one or two footprints on the sand.  While La Roche was\r\nexamining these, his companion walked towards a point of rock that\r\njutted out from the cliffs and intercepted the view beyond.  On turning\r\nround this, he became suddenly rooted to the spot with horror.  And\r\nlittle wonder, for just two yards before him stood an enormous polar\r\nbear, whose career was suddenly arrested by Bryan's unexpected\r\nappearance.  It is difficult to say whether the man or the beast\r\nexpressed most surprise at the rencounter.  They both stood stock still,\r\nand opened their eyes to the utmost width.  But the poor Irishman was\r\nevidently petrified by the apparition.  He turned deadly pale, and his\r\nhands hung idly by his sides; while the bear, recovering from his\r\nsurprise, rose on his hind legs and walked up to him--a sure sign that\r\nhe was quite undaunted, and had made up his mind to give battle.  As for\r\nLa Roche, the instant he cast his eyes on the ferocious-looking\r\nquadruped, he uttered a frightful yell, bounded towards a neighbouring\r\ntree, and ceased not to ascend until its topmost branches were bending\r\nbeneath his weight.  Meanwhile the bear walked up to Bryan, but not\r\nmeeting with the anticipated grapple of an enemy, and feeling somewhat\r\nuneasy under the cataleptic stare of the poor man's eyes--for he still\r\nstood petrified with horror--it walked slowly round him, putting its\r\ncold nose on his cheek, as if to tempt him to move.  But the five\r\nminutes of bewilderment that always preceded Bryan's recovery from a\r\nsudden fright had not yet expired.  He still remained perfectly\r\nmotionless, so that the bear, disdaining, apparently, to attack an\r\nunresisting foe, dropped on his forelegs again.  It is difficult to say\r\nwhether there is any truth in the well-known opinion that the calm,\r\nsteady gaze of a human eye can quell any animal.  Doubtless there are\r\nmany stories, more or less authentic, corroborative of the fact; but\r\nwhether this be true or not, we are ready to vouch for the truth of\r\n_this_ fact--namely, that under the influence of the blacksmith's gaze,\r\nor his silence it may be, the bear was absolutely discomfited.  It\r\nretreated a step or two, and walked slowly away, looking over its\r\nshoulder now and then as it went, as if it half anticipated an onslaught\r\nin the rear.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that Bryan was no craven, and that when his\r\nfaculties were collected he usually displayed a good deal of reckless\r\nvalour on occasions of danger.  Accordingly, no sooner did he see his\r\nshaggy adversary in full retreat, than the truant blood returned to his\r\nface with a degree of violence that caused it to blaze with fiery red,\r\nand swelled the large veins of his neck and forehead almost to bursting.\r\nUttering a truly Irish halloo, he bounded forward like a tiger, tore\r\nthe cap off his head and flung it violently before him, drew the axe\r\nwhich always hung at his belt, and in another moment stood face to face\r\nwith the white monster, which had instantly accepted the challenge, and\r\nrose on its hind legs to receive him.  Raising the axe with both hands,\r\nthe man aimed a blow at the bear's head; but with a rapid movement of\r\nits paw it turned the weapon aside and dashed it into the air.  Another\r\nsuch blow, and the reckless blacksmith's career would have been brought\r\nto an abrupt conclusion, when the crack of a rifle was heard.  Its echo\r\nreverberated along the cliffs and floated over the calm water as the\r\npolar bear fell dead at Bryan's feet.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Frank Morton, as he sprang from the bushes, knife in\r\nhand, ready to finish the work which his rifle had so well begun.  But\r\nit needed not.  Frank had hit the exact spot behind the ear which\r\nrenders a second ball unnecessary--the bear was already quite dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nA STORM BREWING--IT BURSTS, AND PRODUCES CONSEQUENCES--THE PARTY TAKE TO\r\nTHE WATER PER FORCE--ALL SAVED.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Bryan! `a friend in need is a friend indeed,'\" said Frank, as he\r\nsat on a rock watching the blacksmith and his two Indians while they\r\nperformed the operation of skinning the bear, whose timely destruction\r\nhas been related in the last chapter.  \"I must say I never saw a man\r\nstand his ground so well, with a brute like that stealing kisses from\r\nhis cheek.  Were they sweet, Bryan?  Did they remind you of the fair\r\nmaid of Derry, hey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! thrue for ye,\" replied the blacksmith, as he stepped to a rock for\r\nthe purpose of whetting his knife; \"yer honour was just in time to save\r\nme a power o' throuble.  Bad skran to the baste! it would have taken\r\nthree or four rounds at laste to have finished him nately off, for\r\nthere's no end o' fat on his ribs that would have kep' the knife from\r\ngoin' far in.\"\r\n\r\nFrank laughed at this free-and-easy way of looking at it.  \"So you think\r\nyou would have killed him, do you, if I had not saved you the trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Av coorse I do.  Shure a man is better than a baste any day; and\r\nbesides, had I not a frind at my back ridy to help me?\"  Bryan cast a\r\ncomical leer at La Roche as he said this, and the poor Frenchman\r\nblushed, for he felt that his conduct in the affair had not been very\r\npraiseworthy.  It is due to La Roche to say, however, that no sooner had\r\nhe found himself at the top of the tree, and had a moment to reflect,\r\nthan he slid rapidly to the bottom again, and ran to the assistance of\r\nhis friend, not, however, in time to render such assistance available,\r\nas he came up just at the moment the bear fell.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour afterwards the two large canoes came up, and Bryan and\r\nhis little friend had to undergo a rapid fire of witticism from their\r\nsurprised and highly-amused comrades.  Even Moses was stirred up to say\r\nthat \"Bryan, him do pratty well; he most good 'nuff to make an Eskimo!\"\r\n\r\nHaving embarked the skin of the bear, the canoes once more resumed their\r\nusual order and continued on their way.  The carcass of the bear being\r\nuseless for food, was left for the wolves; and the claws, which were\r\nnearly as large as a man's finger, were given by Frank to the\r\nblacksmith, that he might make them into a necklace, as the Indians do,\r\nand keep it in remembrance of his rencounter.\r\n\r\nBut the weather was now beginning to change.  Dick Prince, whose black\r\neye was ever roving about observantly, told Massan that a storm was\r\nbrewing, and that the sooner he put ashore in a convenient spot the\r\nbetter.  But Stanley was anxious to get on, having a long journey before\r\nhim, at the termination of which there would be little enough time to\r\nerect a sufficient protection against the winter of the north; so he\r\ncontinued to advance along shore until they came to a point beyond which\r\nthere was a very deep bay that would take them many hours to coast.  By\r\nmaking a traverse, however, in a direct line to the next point, they\r\nmight cross it in a much shorter time.\r\n\r\n\"How say you, Prince? shall we cross?\" asked Stanley, as they rested on\r\ntheir paddles and cast furtive glances up at the dark clouds and across\r\nthe still quiet bay.\r\n\r\nPrince shook his head.  \"I fear we won't have time to cross.  The clouds\r\nare driving too fast and growin' black.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, we had better encamp,\" said Stanley.--\"Is there a proper\r\nplace, Massan, hereabouts?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" replied the guide.  \"The stones on the beach are the only\r\npillows within six mile o' us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho! then, forward, boys, make a bold push for it,\" cried Stanley; \"if\r\nit does begin to blow before we're over, we can run back again at all\r\nevents.\"\r\n\r\nIn another moment the canoes swept out to sea, and made for the point\r\nfar ahead like race-horses.  Although the clouds continued to gather,\r\nthe wind did not rise, and it seemed as though they would get over\r\neasily, when a sudden gust came off the shore--a direction whence, from\r\nthe appearance of the clouds, it had not been expected.  Ruffling the\r\nsurface of the water for a few seconds, it passed away.\r\n\r\n\"Give way, boys, give way,\" cried Massan, using his large steering\r\npaddle with a degree of energy that sent the canoe plunging forward.\r\n\"We can't go back, an' if the storm bursts off the shore--\"\r\n\r\nA loud peal of thunder drowned the remainder of the sentence, and in a\r\nfew seconds the wind that had been dreaded came whistling violently off\r\nthe shore and covered the sea with foam.  The waves soon began to rise,\r\nand ere long the frail barks, which were ill calculated to weather a\r\nstorm, were careering over them and shipping water at every plunge.\r\n\r\nIt now became a matter of life and death with them that they should gain\r\nthe point, for, deeply loaded as they were, it was impossible that they\r\ncould float long in such a sea.  It is true that a wind off the shore\r\ndoes not usually raise what sailors would consider much of a sea; but it\r\nmust be remembered that, although it was off shore, the bay which they\r\nwere crossing extended far inland, so that the gale had a wide sweep of\r\nwater to act upon before it reached them.  Besides this, as has already\r\nbeen explained, canoes are not like boats.  Their timbers are weak, the\r\nbark of which they are made is thin, the gum which makes their seams\r\ntight is easily knocked off in cold water, and, in short, they cannot\r\nface a sea on which a boat might ride like a sea-gull.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time the men strained every nerve to gain the\r\nwished-for point of land, but with so little success that it became\r\nevident they would never reach it.  The men began to show signs of\r\nflagging, and cast uneasy glances towards Stanley, as if they had lost\r\nall hope of accomplishing their object, and waited for him to suggest\r\nwhat they should do.  Poor Mrs Stanley sat holding on to the gunwale\r\nwith one hand and clasping Edith round the waist with the other, as she\r\ngazed wistfully towards the cape ahead, which was now almost lost to\r\nview under the shadow of a dark cloud that rolled towards them like a\r\nblack pall laden with destruction.\r\n\r\n\"God help us!\" murmured Stanley, in an undertone, as he scanned the\r\nseaward horizon, which was covered with leaden clouds and streaks of\r\nlurid light, beneath which the foaming sea leaped furiously.\r\n\r\n\"Call upon Me in the time of trouble, and I will deliver thee,\" said\r\nMrs Stanley, who overheard the exclamation.\r\n\r\nStanley either heard her not or his mind was too deeply concentrated on\r\nthe critical nature of their position to make any reply.  As she buried\r\nher face in her hands, Edith threw her trembling arms round her mother\r\nand hid her face in her bosom.  Even Chimo seemed to understand their\r\ndanger, for he crept closer to the side of his young mistress and whined\r\nin a low tone, as if in sympathy.  The waves had now increased to such a\r\ndegree that it required two of the men to bail incessantly in order to\r\nprevent their being swamped, and as Stanley cast a hurried glance at the\r\nother canoes, which were not far off, he observed that it was as much as\r\nthey could do to keep afloat.  \"Could we not run back, Massan?\" asked\r\nStanley, in despair.\r\n\r\n\"Unposs'ble, sir,\" replied the guide, whose voice was almost drowned by\r\nthe whistling of the wind.  \"We're more nor half-way over, an' it would\r\nonly blow us farther out to sea if we was to try.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the guide spoke, Stanley was gazing earnestly in the direction of\r\nthe horizon.\r\n\r\n\"Round with you, Massan,\" he exclaimed suddenly; \"put the canoe about\r\nand paddle straight out to sea.--Hallo!\" he shouted to the other canoes,\r\n\"follow us out to sea--straight out.\"\r\n\r\nThe men looked aghast at this extraordinary order.  \"Look alive, lads,\"\r\ncontinued their leader; \"I see an island away there to leeward.  Perhaps\r\nit's only a rock, but any way it's our only chance.\"\r\n\r\nThe canoes' heads were turned round, and in another moment they were\r\ndriving swiftly before the wind in the direction of the open sea.\r\n\r\n\"Right, right,\" murmured Dick Prince, as they made towards this new\r\nsource of hope; \"mayhap it's only a bit o' ice, but even that's better\r\nthan nothin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"If 'tis only ice,\" cried La Roche, \"ye have ver' pauvre chance at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shure, an' if we are to go ashore at all, at all,\" said Bryan, whose\r\nspirits had suddenly risen with this gleam of hope from fifty degrees\r\nbelow to fifty above zero--\"if we are to go ashore at all, at all, it's\r\nbetter to land on the ice than on the wather.\"\r\n\r\nWith such a breeze urging them on, the three canoes soon approached what\r\nappeared to be a low sand-bank, on which the sea was dashing in white\r\nfoam.  But from the tossing of the waves between them and the beach, it\r\nwas difficult to form a conjecture as to its size.  Indeed, at times\r\nthey could scarcely see it at all, owing to the darkness of the day and\r\nthe heavy rain which began to fall just as they approached; and more\r\nthan once Stanley's heart sank when he lost sight of the bank, and he\r\nbegan to think that he had made a mistake, and that they were actually\r\nflying out to the deep sea, in which case all hope would be gone for\r\never.  But God's mercy was extended to them in this hour of peril.  The\r\nisland appeared to grow larger as they neared it, and at last they were\r\nwithin a stone's-throw of the shore.  But a new danger assailed them\r\nhere.  The largest canoe, which neared the island first, had begun to\r\nleak, and took in water so fast that the utmost efforts of those who\r\nbailed could not keep it under, and from the quantity that was now\r\nshipped they made very little way.  To add to the horror of the scene,\r\nthe sky became very dark, and another crash of thunder pealed forth\r\naccompanied by a blinding flash of lightning.\r\n\r\n\"Paddle, boys, paddle for your lives!\" cried Stanley, throwing off his\r\ncoat, and seizing a tin dish, with which he began to throw out the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe canoe rose on a huge wave which broke all round it.  This nearly\r\nfilled it with water, and carried it towards the shore with such\r\nvelocity that it seemed as if they should be dashed in pieces; but they\r\nfell back into the trough of the sea, and lay motionless like a heavy\r\nlog, and in a sinking condition.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads, look out for the next wave, and give way with a will,\" cried\r\nMassan.  The worthy steersman acted rather too energetically on his own\r\nadvice, for he dipped his paddle with such force that it snapped in two.\r\n\r\n\"Be ready to jump out,\" cried Dick Prince, standing up in the bow in\r\norder to give more power to his strokes.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Stanley turned to his wife, and said, \"Jessie, hold on by\r\nmy collar; I'll take Eda in my arms.\"  At that instant the canoe gave a\r\nlurch, and before Stanley could grasp his child, they were all\r\nstruggling in the sea!  At this awful moment, instead of endeavouring to\r\ndo as her husband directed, Mrs Stanley instinctively threw her arms\r\naround Edith, and while the waves were boiling over her, she clasped the\r\nchild tightly to her bosom with her left arm, while with her right she\r\nendeavoured to raise herself to the surface.  Twice she succeeded, and\r\ntwice she sank, when a box of merchandise providentially struck her arm.\r\nSeizing this, she raised herself above the water, and poor Edith gasped\r\nconvulsively once or twice for air.  Then the box was wrenched from her\r\ngrasp by a wave, and with a wild shriek she sank again.  Just then a\r\nstrong arm was thrown around her, her feet touched the ground, and in a\r\nfew seconds she was dragged violently from the roaring waves and fell\r\nexhausted on the beach.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks be to God, we are saved!\" murmured Mrs Stanley, as her husband\r\nassisted her to rise and led her beyond the reach of the waves, while\r\nEdith still clung with a deadly grasp to her mother's neck.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, Jessie, thank God indeed!  But for His mercy we should have all\r\nbeen lost.  I was floundering about beside the canoe when your scream\r\nshowed me where you were, and enabled me to save you.  But rest here, in\r\nthe lee of this bale.--I cannot stay by you.  Frank is in danger still.\"\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for a reply, he sprang from her side and hurried down to\r\nthe beach.  Here everything was in the utmost confusion.  The two large\r\ncanoes had been saved and dragged out of the reach of the waves, and the\r\nmen were struggling in the boiling surf to rescue the baggage and\r\nprovisions, on which latter their very lives depended.  As Stanley\r\nreached the scene of action, he observed several of the men watching the\r\nsmall canoe which contained Frank and his two Indians.  It had been left\r\nsome distance behind by the others, and was now approaching with arrow\r\nspeed on the summit of a large wave.  Suddenly the top of the billow\r\ncurled over, and in another moment the canoe was turned bottom up!  Like\r\na cork it danced on the wave's white crest, then falling beneath the\r\nthundering mass of water, it was crushed to pieces and cast empty upon\r\nthe beach.  But Frank and his men swam like otters, and the party on\r\nshore watched them with anxious looks as they breasted manfully over the\r\nbillows.  At last a towering wave came rolling majestically forward.  It\r\ncaught the three swimmers in its rough embrace, and carrying them along\r\non its crest, launched them on the beach, where it left them struggling\r\nwith the retreating water.  Those who have bathed in rough weather on an\r\nexposed coast know well how difficult it is to regain a firm footing on\r\nloose sand while a heavy wave is sweeping backward into its parent\r\nocean.  Frank and the two Indians experienced this; and they might have\r\nstruggled there till their strength had been exhausted, were it not for\r\nStanley, Prince, and Massan, who rushed simultaneously into the water\r\nand rescued them.\r\n\r\nAs the whole party had now, by the goodness of God, reached the land in\r\nsafety, they turned their undivided energies towards the bales and boxes\r\nwhich were rolling about in the surf.  Many of these had been already\r\ncollected, and were carried to the spot where Mrs Stanley and Edith lay\r\nunder the shelter of a bale.  As the things were successively brought up\r\nthey were piled around the mother and child, who soon found themselves\r\npretty well sheltered from the wind, though not from the rain, which\r\nstill fell in torrents.  Soon after Frank came to them, and said that\r\nall the things were saved, and that it was time to think of getting up\r\nsome sort of shelter for the night.  This was very much needed, for poor\r\nEdith was beginning to shiver from the wet and cold.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, Francois, Massan,\" shouted Frank, \"lend a hand here to build\r\na house for Eda.  We'll be all as snug as need be in a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the cold and her recent terror, the poor child could not help\r\nsmiling at the idea of building a house in a few minutes, and it was\r\nwith no little curiosity that she watched the operations of the men.\r\nMeanwhile Mr Stanley brought some wine in a pannikin, and made Edith\r\nand his wife drink a little.  This revived them greatly, and as the rain\r\nhad now almost ceased they rose and endeavoured to wring the water out\r\nof their garments.  In less than half an hour the men piled the bales\r\nand boxes in front of the largest canoe, which was turned bottom up, and\r\nsecured firmly in that position by an embankment of sand.  Over the top\r\nof all, three oil-cloths were spread and lashed down, thus forming a\r\ncomplete shelter, large enough to contain the whole party.  At one end\r\nof this curious house Mr Stanley made a separate apartment for his wife\r\nand child, by placing two large bales and a box as a partition; and\r\nwithin this little space Edith soon became very busy in arranging\r\nthings, and \"putting the house to rights,\" as she said, as long as the\r\ndaylight lasted, for after it went away they had neither candles nor\r\nfire, as the former had been soaked and broken, and as for the latter no\r\nwood could be found on the island.  The men's clothes were, of course,\r\nquite wet, so they cut open a bale of blankets, which had not been so\r\nmuch soaked as the other goods, having been among the first things that\r\nwere washed ashore.\r\n\r\nAt the time they were wrecked the dashing spray and the heavy rain,\r\ntogether with the darkness of the day, had prevented the shipwrecked\r\nvoyageurs from ascertaining the nature of the island on which they had\r\nbeen cast; and as the night closed in while they were yet engaged in the\r\nerection of their temporary shelter, they had to lie down to rest in\r\nignorance on this point.  After such a day of unusual fatigue and\r\nexcitement, they all felt more inclined for rest than food; so, instead\r\nof taking supper, they all lay down huddled together under the canoe,\r\nand slept soundly, while the angry winds whistled round them, and the\r\ngreat sea roared and lashed itself into foam on the beach, as if\r\ndisappointed that the little band of adventurers had escaped and were\r\nnow beyond the reach of its impotent fury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nTHE SAND-BANK--DISMAL PROSPECTS--CONSULTATIONS--INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS\r\nEXPOSED AND DETAILED.\r\n\r\nOf all the changes that constantly vary the face of nature, the calm\r\nthat succeeds a storm is one of the most beautiful, and the most\r\nagreeable, perhaps, to the feelings of man.  Few conditions of nature\r\nconvey to the mind more thoroughly the idea of complete repose--of deep\r\nrest after mortal strife, of sleep after exhausting toil; and those who\r\nhave passed through the violence of the storm and done battle with its\r\ndangers are, by the physical rest which they enjoy after it is over, the\r\nmore fitted to appreciate and sympathise with the repose which reigns\r\naround them.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun rose, on the morning after the storm, it shone upon a scene\r\nso calm and beautiful, so utterly unconnected with anything like the sin\r\nof a fallen world, and so typical, in its deep tranquillity, of the mind\r\nof Him who created it, that it seemed almost possible for a moment to\r\nfancy that the promised land was gained at last, and that all the dark\r\nclouds, the storms and dangers, the weary journeyings and the troubles\r\nof the wilderness, were past and gone for ever.  So glorious was the\r\nscene that when Edith, rising from her rude couch and stepping over the\r\nprostrate forms of her still slumbering companions, issued from the\r\nshelter of the canoe and cast her eyes abroad upon the glassy sea, she\r\ncould not restrain her feelings, and uttered a thrilling shout of joy\r\nthat floated over the waters and reverberated among the glittering crags\r\nof the surrounding icebergs.\r\n\r\nThe island on which the travellers had been cast was a mere knoll of\r\nsand, not more than a few hundred yards in circumference, that scarcely\r\nraised its rounded summit above the level of the water, and at full tide\r\nwas reduced to a mere speck, utterly destitute of vegetation.  The sea\r\naround it was now smooth and clear as glass, though undulated by a long,\r\nregular swell, which rolled, at slow, solemn intervals, in majestic\r\nwaves towards the sand-bank, where they hovered for a moment in curved\r\nwalls of dark-green water, then, lipping over, at their crests, fell in\r\na roar of foam that hissed a deep sigh on the pebbles of the beach, and\r\nleft the silence greater than before.  Masses of ice floated here and\r\nthere on the surface of the deep, the edges and fantastic points of\r\nwhich were tipped with light.  Not far from the northern extremity of\r\nthe sand-bank a large iceberg had grounded, from the sides of which\r\nseveral pinnacles had been hurled by the shock and now lay stranded on\r\nthe beach.\r\n\r\nThe shout with which Edith had welcomed the morning roused the whole\r\nparty, and in a few minutes they were all assembled outside of their\r\nlittle hut, some admiring the scene, others--of a less enthusiastic and\r\nmore practical turn--examining the circumstances of their position, and\r\nconsidering the best course that should be pursued in their difficulty.\r\n\r\nMr Stanley, Dick Prince, and Massan, as was their wont, held a council\r\nupon the existing state of things, and after much gazing round at the\r\nsea and up at the sky, and considerable grunting of his deep voice and\r\nrubbing of his capacious chin, on the part of the latter, he turned to\r\nDick Prince, as if appealing to his superior sagacity, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Well, ye see, my 'pinion's jist this: yonder's the mainland there\"\r\n(pointing to the eastward, where, about ten miles distant, the rocks and\r\ntrees were seen distorted and faintly looming through a tremulous haze),\r\n\"an' there's our canoes _there_\" (jerking his thumb over his shoulder in\r\nthe direction of the large canoes, whose torn sides and damaged ribs, as\r\nthey lay exposed on the sand, bore sad testimony to the violence of the\r\nprevious night's storm), \"and there's the little canoe yonder,\"\r\n(glancing towards the craft in question, which lay on the beach a\r\nhopelessly-destroyed mass of splinters and shreds of bark that projected\r\nand bristled in all directions, as in uncontrollable amazement at the\r\nsuddenness and entirety of its own destruction).  \"Now, that bein' the\r\ncase, an' the baggage all wet, an' the day parfitly beautiful, an' the\r\nsun about hot enough to bile the sea, we can't do better nor stay where\r\nwe are, an' mend the canoes, dry the goods, an' start fair to-morrow\r\nmornin'.\"\r\n\r\nStanley looked at Prince, as if expecting a remark from him; but the\r\ngrave countenance of the silent bowman indicated that he was absorbed in\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis quite evident, Massan,\" said Stanley, \"that we must repair the\r\ncanoes; but a few hours could do that, and I don't like the idea of\r\nstaying another night on a strip of sand like this, which, I verily\r\nbelieve, another stiff nor'-wester would blow away altogether.--But what\r\nsay you, Prince?  Do you advise our remaining?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Dick, \"I do.  Ye see there's no fear of another storm\r\nsoon.  'Tis a good chance for dryin' the goods, so I vote for stoppin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, we shall stay,\" replied Stanley.  \"To say truth, I agreed\r\nwith you at first, Massan, but it's always advisable to look at both\r\nsides of a question--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and `in the multitude of counsellors there is wisdom,'\" said Frank\r\nMorton, coming up at the moment, and tapping his friend on the shoulder.\r\n\"If you will include me in your confabulation, you shall have the\r\nbenefit of deep experience and far-sighted sagacity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, then, Master Frank,\" replied Stanley, \"what does your sagacity\r\nadvise on the point of our staying on this sandbank?  Shall we spend\r\nanother night on it in order to dry the goods, or shall we up and away\r\nto _terra firma_ as soon as the canoes are seaworthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay, of course,\" said Frank.  \"As to the sand-bank, 'tis firm enough,\r\nto my mind, after resisting the shock of the wave that dashed me ashore\r\nlast night.  Then we have everything we need--shelter and food, and even\r\nfuel.\"  As Frank mentioned the last word, he glanced round with a rueful\r\ncountenance and pointed to the bark and timbers of his broken canoe.\r\n\r\n\"True, Frank, we have wherewith to boil the kettle, and as the\r\nwater-cask was full when we started yesterday morning, there will be\r\nenough at least for one or two days.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way, that reminds me that Eda and your wife are particularly\r\ndesirous of having breakfast,\" said Frank.  \"In fact they sent me\r\nspecially to lay their melancholy case before you; and I have great\r\nfears that Eda will lay violent hands on the raw pork if her morning\r\nmeal is delayed much longer.  As for Chimo, he is rushing about the\r\nisland in a state of ravenous despair; so pray let us be going.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so, Frank,\" said Stanley, taking his friend's arm, and sauntering\r\ntowards the canoe, while Massan and Prince went to inform their comrades\r\nof the determination of their leader.\r\n\r\nIn an hour after the above discourse breakfast was over, and the men,\r\nunder Stanley's inspection, arranged and examined the baggage, which,\r\nconsidering that it had been rolled about by the surf for a considerable\r\ntime, was not so much soaked as might have been expected.  The two kegs\r\nof gunpowder were first inspected, being the most valuable part of the\r\ncargo, as on them depended much of their future livelihood.  They were\r\nfound to be quite dry, except a small portion of powder at the seams of\r\nthe staves, which, having caked with the moisture, had saved the rest\r\nfrom damage.  Some of the bales, however, containing knives and other\r\nhardware, were very wet, and had to be opened out and their contents\r\nwiped and spread out to dry.  Blankets, too, and other woollen garments\r\nthat had suffered, were also spread out on the sand, so that in a short\r\ntime the little island was quite covered with a strange assortment of\r\nmiscellaneous articles, that gave to it the appearance of a crowded\r\nstore.  The entire wealth of the fur-traders was now exposed to view,\r\nand it may perhaps be interesting to enumerate the different articles,\r\nin order to give some idea of the outfit deemed necessary on such an\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, there were two kegs of gunpowder, as before mentioned,\r\ncontaining each thirty pounds, with four bags of ball and three of shot\r\nof various sizes--in all, about 250 pounds of lead.  Six nets of four\r\nand a half inch mesh.  A large quantity of twine for making nets--most\r\nof the men being able to construct these useful articles.  A small bag\r\nof gun-flints.  Sixty pounds of roll tobacco.  Twelve large axes.  Six\r\naugers.  Seven dozen scalping-knives.  Six pounds of variously-coloured\r\nbeads.  Two dozen fire-steels, and a pretty large assortment of awls,\r\nneedles, thread, nails, and such like small articles, which, though\r\nextremely useful, were too numerous and comparatively insignificant to\r\nmention in detail.  Besides these, there was a small bale containing\r\ngaudy ornaments and attractive articles, which were intended as\r\npropitiatory presents to the Esquimaux when they should be met with.\r\nThen there were two runlets of salt pork, containing about ninety pounds\r\neach, and in the centre of each runlet were two hams.  A barrel of flour\r\nand a barrel of oatmeal constituted all their provision, if we except a\r\nsmall cask of hard biscuit, and a little tea and sugar, which were the\r\nprivate property of Stanley and Frank Morton.  There was also a large\r\ndeerskin tent, capable of holding from twenty to thirty men, which was\r\nintended to be used while they were engaged in building their winter\r\nresidence at Ungava.  As to arms, each man had one of the long\r\nsingle-barrelled fowling-pieces that are supplied by the Fur Company to\r\nthe natives, and are styled Indian guns.  Stanley had a double-barrelled\r\nflint fowling-piece; and Frank had a rifle, besides a single gun of a\r\ndescription somewhat finer than that supplied to the Indians.  Of course\r\neach man carried a scalping-knife and an axe in his belt, not for the\r\npurpose of self-defence, but for carving their food and cutting their\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to remark here that the goods and provisions which we\r\nhave detailed above were merely intended as a supply for their immediate\r\nnecessities, and to enable them to commence active operations at once on\r\narriving at their destination, while the heavy stores and goods\r\nnecessary for the year's trade were to be forwarded in a small sloop\r\nfrom the depot direct through Hudson's Straits to Ungava Bay.\r\n\r\nWhen the work of unpacking and exposing the things to dry in the sun was\r\naccomplished, it was long past noon, and high time for dinner; so a fire\r\nwas lighted by Bryan, who cut up another portion of Frank's canoe for\r\nthe purpose.  A rasher of pork and a flour cake were disposed of by each\r\nof the party in a surprisingly short time, and then the men bestirred\r\nthemselves in mending the canoes.  This was a more troublesome job than\r\nthey expected, but being accustomed not only to mend but to make canoes,\r\nthey worked with a degree of skill and diligence that speedily put all\r\nto rights.  In Massan's canoe there was a hole large enough, as Bryan\r\nremarked, to stick his head through, though it was a \"big wan, an' no\r\nmistake.\"  Taking up a roll of bark, which was carried with them for the\r\npurpose, Massan cut from it a square patch, which he _sewed_ over the\r\nhole, using an awl for a needle and the fibrous roots of the pine tree,\r\ncalled wattape, for thread.  After it was firmly sewed on, the seams\r\nwere covered with melted gum, and the broken spot was as tight and\r\nstrong as ever.  There were next found several long slits, one of them\r\nfully three feet, which were more easily managed, as they merely\r\nrequired to be sewed and covered with gum.  Several broken ribs,\r\nhowever, were not so easily repaired.  Had there been any wood on the\r\nisland, Massan's quick knife would have soon fashioned new ribs; as it\r\nwas, he had to make the best job he could, by splicing the old ones with\r\nseveral pieces abstracted from Frank's little canoe.\r\n\r\nIt was sunset before all was put in complete order, the goods repacked,\r\nand placed in readiness for a start at daybreak on the following\r\nmorning.  After all was done, the remains of the small canoe were\r\nconverted into a bonfire, round which the tired and hungry travellers\r\nassembled to smoke and chat, while supper was being prepared by the\r\nindefatigable Bryan and his friend La Roche.  As the day faded away the\r\nstars came out, one by one, until they glittered in millions in the sky,\r\nwhile the glare of the fire became every moment more and more intense as\r\nthe darkness deepened.  It was a strange, wild scene,--especially when\r\nviewed from the extremity of the little sand-bank, which was so low as\r\nto be almost indiscernible in the dark night, and seemed scarce a\r\nsufficient foundation for the little busy group of human beings who\r\nstood radiant in the red light of their camp-fire, like a blazing gem\r\ncast upon the surface of the great, cold sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nSTART AFRESH--SUPERSTITIOUS NOTIONS--THE WHIRLPOOL--THE INTERIOR--\r\nFISHING IN THE OLD WAY ON NEW GROUND, AND WHAT CAME OF IT--A COLD BATH--\r\nTHE RESCUE--SAVED--DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE WILDERNESS.\r\n\r\nAs if to make amends for its late outrageous conduct, the weather, after\r\nthe night of the great storm, continued unbrokenly serene for many days,\r\nenabling our travellers to make rapid progress towards their\r\ndestination: It would be both tiresome and unnecessary to follow them\r\nstep by step throughout their journey, as the part of it which we have\r\nalready described was, in many respects, typical of the whole voyage\r\nalong the east coast of Hudson's Bay.  Sometimes, indeed, a few\r\nincidents of an unusual character did occur.  Once they were very nearly\r\nbeing crushed between masses of ice; twice the larger canoe struck on a\r\nhummock, and had to be landed and repaired; and frequently mishaps of a\r\nslighter nature befell them.  Their beds, too, varied occasionally.  At\r\none time they laid them down to rest on the sand of the sea-shore; at\r\nanother, on the soft turf and springy moss of the woods.  Sometimes they\r\nwere compelled to content themselves with a couch of pebbles, few of\r\nwhich were smaller than a man's fist; and, not unfrequently, they had to\r\nmake the best they could of a flat rock, whose unyielding surface seemed\r\nto put the idea of anything like rest to flight, causing the thin men of\r\nthe party to growl and the fat ones to chuckle.  Bryan was one of the\r\nwell-favoured, being round and fleshy; while his poor little friend La\r\nRoche possessed a framework of bones that were so sparingly covered with\r\nsofter substance, as to render it a matter of wonder how he and the\r\nstones could compromise the matter at all, and called forth from his\r\nfriend frequent impertinent allusions to \"thridpapers, bags o' bones,\r\nidges o' knives, half fathoms o' pump water,\" and such like curious\r\nsubstances.  But whatever the bed, it invariably turned out that the\r\nwhole party slept soundly from the time they lay down till the time of\r\nrising, which was usually at the break of day.\r\n\r\nOwing to the little Indian canoe having been wrecked on the sand-bank,\r\nFrank and his men had to embark in the smaller of the large canoes; a\r\nchange which was in some respects a disadvantage to the party, as Frank\r\ncould not now so readily dash away in pursuit of game.  However, this\r\ndid not much matter, as, in a few days afterwards, they arrived at the\r\nmouth of the river by which they intended to penetrate into the interior\r\nof the country.  The name of the river is Deer River, and it flows into\r\nRichmond Gulf, which is situated on the east shore of Hudson's Bay, in\r\nlatitude 56 degrees North.  Richmond Gulf is twenty miles long, and\r\nabout the same in breadth; but the entrance to it is so narrow that the\r\ntide pours into it like a torrent until it is full.  The pent-up waters\r\nthen rush out on one side of this narrow inlet while they are running in\r\nat the other, causing a whirlpool which would engulf a large boat and\r\ngreatly endanger even a small vessel.  Of course it was out of the\r\nquestion to attempt the passage of such a vortex in canoes, except at\r\nhalf flood or half ebb tide, at which periods the waters became quiet.\r\nOn arriving at the mouth of the gulf, the travellers found the tide out\r\nand the entrance to it curling and rolling in massive volumes, as if all\r\nthe evil water-spirits of the north were holding their orgies there.\r\nOostesimow and Ma-Istequan, being by nature and education intensely\r\nsuperstitious, told Stanley--after they had landed to await the flow of\r\nthe tide--that it was absolutely necessary to perform certain ceremonies\r\nin order to propitiate the deities of the place, otherwise they could\r\nnot expect to pass such an awful whirlpool in safety.  Their leader\r\nsmiled, and told them to do as they thought fit, adding, however, that\r\nhe would not join them, as he did not believe in any deities whatever,\r\nexcept the one true God, who did not require to be propitiated in any\r\nway, and could not be moved by any other means than by prayer in the\r\nname of Jesus Christ.  The red men seemed surprised a little at this,\r\nbut, with their proverbial stoicism, refrained from any further or more\r\ndecided expression of feeling.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Indians sufficiently showed their faith in their own\r\ndoctrines by immediately setting about a series of curious and elaborate\r\nceremonies, which it was impossible to comprehend, and decidedly\r\nunprofitable to describe.  They appeared, however, to attach much\r\nimportance to their propitiatory offerings, the chief among which seemed\r\nto be a few inches of tobacco, with which it was fondly hoped the\r\ndeities of the gulf would condescend to smoke the pipe of peace while\r\ntheir red children ventured to trespass a little on their domain; and\r\nhard indeed must have been the hearts of the said spirits had they\r\nrefused so valuable an offering, for tobacco is the life and marrow, the\r\nquintessence of terrestrial felicity, the very joy and comfort of a\r\nvoyageur, and the poor Indians had but little of it to spare.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, Bryan stood with his back to the fire, a\r\nremarkably short and peculiarly black pipe in his mouth, and his head\r\ninclined sagaciously to one side, as if he designed, by dint of a\r\ncombination of intense mental abstraction, partial closing of his eyes,\r\nsevere knitting of his brows, and slow but exceedingly voluminous\r\nemission of smoke, to come to a conclusion in regard to the unfathomable\r\nsubject of Indian superstition.  La Roche, steeped in unphilosophic\r\nindifference on such matters, and keenly alive to the gross cravings of\r\nhunger, busied himself in concocting a kettle of soup; while the rest of\r\nthe party rambled about the beach or among the bushes in search of eggs.\r\nIn this latter search Frank and Edith were very successful, and\r\nreturned with pockets laden with excellent eggs of the eider-duck, which\r\nwere immediately put into the kettle, and tended not a little to\r\nincrease the excellence of the soup and the impatience of the men.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the tide rose, the power of the current was gradually checked,\r\nand towards noon they passed the dangerous narrows in safety.  From the\r\nview that was now obtained of the interior, it became evident that the\r\nworst of their journey yet lay before them.  On arriving at the mouth of\r\nDeer River, the mountains were seen to rise abruptly and precipitously,\r\nwhile far away inland their faint blue peaks rose into the sky.  Indeed\r\nfrom this point the really hard work of the voyage may be said to have\r\ncommenced; for scarcely had they proceeded a few miles up the river,\r\nwhen their further progress, at least by water, was effectually\r\ninterrupted by a rapid which came leaping madly down its rocky bed, as\r\nif the streams rejoiced to escape from the chasms and mountain gorges,\r\nand find rest at last on the ample bosom of the great deep.\r\n\r\n\"What think ye of that, boy?\" said Stanley to Frank Morton, as they\r\nleaped from their respective canoes, and stood gazing at the rugged glen\r\nfrom which the rapid issued, and the wild appearance of the hills\r\nbeyond.  \"It seems to me that report spoke truly when it said that the\r\nway to Clearwater Lake was rugged.  Here is no despicable portage to\r\nbegin with; and yonder cliffs, that look so soft and blue in the far\r\ndistance, will prove to be dark and hard enough when we get at them, I\r\nwarrant.\"\r\n\r\n\"When we get at them!\" echoed Mrs Stanley, as she approached, leading\r\nEdith by the hand.  \"Get at them, George!  Had any one asked me if it\r\nwere possible to pass over these mountains with our canoes and cargoes,\r\nI should have answered, `Decidedly not!'\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet you were so foolish and reckless as to be the first to\r\nvolunteer for this decidedly impossible expedition!\" replied Stanley.\r\n\r\n\"There you are inconsistent,\" said Mrs Stanley, smiling.  \"If reckless,\r\nI cannot be foolish, according to your own showing; for I have heard you\r\ngive it as your opinion that recklessness is one of the most essential\r\nelements in the leaders of a forlorn hope.  But really the thing does\r\nseem to my ignorant mind impossible.--What think you, Eda?\"\r\n\r\nMrs Stanley bent down and looked into the face of her child, but she\r\nreceived no reply.  The expanded eyes, indeed, spoke volumes; and the\r\nparted lips, on which played a fitful, exulting smile, the heightened\r\ncolour, and thick-coming breath, told eloquently of her anticipated\r\ndelight in these new regions, which seemed so utterly different from the\r\nshores of the bay: but her tongue was mute.\r\n\r\nAnd well might Mrs Stanley think the passage over these mountains\r\nimpossible; for, except to men accustomed to canoe travelling in the\r\nAmerican lakes and rivers, such an attempt would have appeared as\r\nhopeless as the passage of a ship through the ice-locked polar seas in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nNot so thought the men.  Already several of the most active of them were\r\nscrambling up the cliffs with heavy loads on their backs; and, while\r\nStanley and his wife were yet conversing, two of them approached\r\nrapidly, bearing the large canoe on their shoulders.  The exclamation\r\nthat issued from the foremost of these proved him to be Bryan.\r\n\r\n\"Now, bad luck to ye, Gaspard! can't ye go stidy?  It's mysilf that'll\r\nbe down on me blissid nose av ye go staggerin' about in that fashion.\r\nSure it's Losh, the spalpeen, that would carry the canoe better than\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nGaspard made no reply.  Bryan staggered on, growling as he went, and in\r\nanother minute they were hid from view among the bushes.\r\n\r\n\"What do you see, Frank?\" inquired Stanley; \"you stare as earnestly as\r\nBryan did at the white bear last week.  What is't, man?  Speak!\"\r\n\r\n\"A fish,\" replied Frank.  \"I saw him rise in the pool, and I'm certain\r\nhe's a very large one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely, Frank; there ought to be a fish of some sort there.  I've\r\nbeen told--hist! there he's again.  As I live, a salmon! a salmon,\r\nFrank!  Now for your rod, my boy.\"\r\n\r\nBut Frank heard him not, for he was gone.  In a few minutes he returned\r\nwith a fishing-rod, which he was busily engaged in putting up as he\r\nhurried towards the rocks beside the pool.\r\n\r\nNow, Frank Morton was a fisher.  We do not mean to say that he was a\r\nfisher by profession; nor do we merely affirm that he was rather fond of\r\nthe gentle art of angling, or generally inclined to take a cast when he\r\nhappened to be near a good stream.  By no means.  Frank was more than\r\nthat implies.  He was a steady, thorough-going disciple of Izaak Walton;\r\none who, in the days of his boyhood, used to flee to the water-side at\r\nall seasons, in all weathers, and despite all obstacles.  Not only was\r\nit his wont to fish when he could, or how he could, but too often was he\r\nbeguiled to fish at times and in ways that were decidedly improper;\r\nsometimes devoting those hours which were set apart expressly for the\r\nacquirement of Greek and Latin, to wandering by mountain stream or tarn,\r\nrod in hand, up to the knees in water, among the braes and woodlands of\r\nhis own native country.  And Frank's enthusiasm did not depend entirely\r\non his success.  It was a standing joke among his school-fellows that\r\nFrank would walk six miles any day for the chance of a nibble from the\r\nghost of a minnow.  Indeed he was often taunted by his ruder comrades\r\nwith being such a keen fisher that he was quite content if he only\r\nhooked a drowned cat during a day's excursion.  But Frank was\r\ngood-natured; he smiled at their jests, and held on the even tenor of\r\nhis way, whipping the streams more pertinaciously than his master\r\nwhipped _him_ for playing truant; content alike to bear ignominy and\r\nchastisement, so long as he was rewarded by a nibble, and overjoyed\r\nbeyond expression when he could return home with the tail of a\r\ntwo-pounder hanging over the edge of his basket.  Far be it from us to\r\nhold up to ridicule the weakness of a friend, but we cannot help adding\r\nthat Master Frank made the most of his tails.  His truthful and manly\r\nnature, indeed, would not stoop to actual deception, but he had been\r\nknown on more than one occasion to offer to carry a friend's waterproof\r\nfishing-boots in his basket, when his doing so rendered it impossible to\r\nprevent the tails of his trout from protruding arrogantly, as if to\r\ninsinuate that there were shoals within.  Another of Frank's weaknesses\r\nwas, upon the hooking of every fish, to assert, with overweening\r\nconfidence and considerable excitement, that it was a tremendously big\r\none.  Experience had, during all his piscatorial career, contradicted\r\nhim ninety-nine times out of every hundred; but Frank's firm belief in\r\nhis last minnow being a big trout--at least until it lay gasping on the\r\nbank at his feet--was as unshaken after long years of mistaken\r\ncalculation as when first he sallied forth to the babbling brook with a\r\nwillow branch, a fathom of twine, and a crooked pin!\r\n\r\nSuch untiring devotion, of course, could not fail to make Frank\r\nparticularly knowing in all the details and minutiae of his much-loved\r\nsport.  He knew every hole and corner of the rivers and burns within\r\nfifteen miles of his father's house.  He became mysteriously wise in\r\nregard to the weather; knew precisely the best fly for any given day,\r\nand, in the event of being unhappily destitute of the proper kind, could\r\ndress one to perfection in ten minutes.  As he grew older and taller,\r\nand the muscles on his large and well-made limbs began to develop, Frank\r\nslung a more capacious basket on his back, shouldered a heavier rod,\r\nand, with a pair of thick shoes and a home-spun shooting suit, stretched\r\naway over the Highland hills towards the romantic shores of the west\r\ncoast of Scotland.  Here he first experienced the wild excitement of\r\nsalmon-fishing; and here the Waltonian chains, that had been twining and\r\nthickening around him from infancy, received two or three additional\r\ncoils, and were finally riveted for ever.  During his sojourn in\r\nAmerica, he had happened to dwell in places where the fishing, though\r\ngood, was not of a very exciting nature; and he had not seen a salmon\r\nsince the day he left home, so that it is not matter for wonder that his\r\nstride was rapid and his eye bright while he hurried towards the pool,\r\nas before mentioned.\r\n\r\nHe who has never left the beaten tracks of men, or trod the unknown\r\nwilderness, can have but a faint conception of the feelings of a true\r\nangler as he stands by the brink of a dark pool which has hitherto\r\nreflected only the antlers of the wild deer--whose dimpling eddies and\r\nflecks of foam have been disturbed by no fisher since the world began,\r\nexcept the polar bear.  Besides the pleasurable emotions of strong hope,\r\nthere is the additional charm of uncertainty as to what will rise, and\r\nof certainty that if there be anything piscatine beneath these\r\nfascinating ripples it undoubtedly _will_ rise--and bite too!  Then\r\nthere is the peculiar satisfaction of catching now and then a drop of\r\nspray from, and hearing the thunder of, a cataract, whose free, surging\r\nbound is not yet shackled by the tourist's sentimental description; and\r\nthe novelty of beholding one's image reflected in a liquid mirror whose\r\ngeographical position is not yet stereotyped on the charts of man.  Alas\r\nfor these maps and charts!  Despite the wishes of scientific geographers\r\nand the ignorance of unscientific explorers, we think them far too\r\ncomplete already; and we can conceive few things more dreadful or\r\ncrushing to the enterprising and romantic spirits of the world than the\r\narrival of that time (if it ever shall arrive) when it shall be said\r\nthat _terra incognita_ exists no longer--when every one of those\r\nfairy-like isles of the southern seas, and all the hidden wonders of the\r\npolar regions, shall be put down, in cold blood, on black and white,\r\nexposed profanely on the schoolroom walls, and drummed into the thick\r\nheads of wretched little boys who don't want to learn, by the\r\nunsympathising hands of dominies who, it may be, care but little whether\r\nthey do or not!\r\n\r\nBut to return.  While Frank stood on the rocks, attaching to the line a\r\nsalmon-fly which he had selected with much consideration from his book,\r\nhe raised his eyes once or twice to take a rapid glance at his position\r\nand the capabilities of the place.  About fifty yards further up the\r\nriver the stream curled round the base of a large rock, and gushed into\r\na pool which was encircled on all sides by an overhanging wall, except\r\nwhere the waters issued forth in a burst of foam.  Their force, however,\r\nwas materially broken by another curve, round which they had to sweep\r\nere they reached this exit, so that when they rushed into the larger\r\npool below they calmed down at once, and on reaching the point where\r\nFrank stood, assumed that oily, gurgling surface, dimpled all over with\r\nlaughing eddies, that suggests irresistibly the idea of fish not only\r\nbeing there, as a matter of course, but being there expressly and solely\r\nfor the purpose of being caught!  A little further down, the river took\r\na slight bend, and immediately after, recurring to its straight course,\r\nit dashed down, for a distance of fifty yards, in a tumultuous rapid,\r\nwhich swept into sudden placidity a few hundred yards below.  Having\r\ntaken all this in at a glance, Frank dropped the fly into the water and\r\nraised his rod to make a cast.  In this act he almost broke the rod, to\r\nhis amazement; for, instead of whipping the fly lightly out of the\r\nwater, he dragged a trout of a pound weight violently up on the bank.\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" cried Stanley, laughing heartily at his friend's stare of\r\nmingled wonder and amazement,--\"bravo, Frank!  I'm no fisher myself, but\r\nI've always understood that fish required a little play before being\r\nlanded.  However, you have convinced me of my ignorance.  I see that the\r\nproper way is to toss them over your head!  A salmon must be rather\r\ntroublesome to toss, but no doubt, with your strong arms, you'll manage\r\nit easily, hey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what an appetite they must have!\" replied Frank, answering his\r\nfriend's badinage with a smile.  \"If the little fellows begin thus, what\r\nwill not the big ones do?\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he disengaged the fish and threw it down, and made the next\r\ncast so rapidly, that if another trout was waiting to play him a similar\r\ntrick, it must have been grievously disappointed.  The line swept\r\nlightly through the air, and the fly fell gently on the stream, where it\r\nhad not quivered more than two seconds when the water gurgled around it.\r\nThe next moment Frank's rod bent like a hoop, and the line flew through\r\nthe rings with whirring rapidity, filling these lonely solitudes for the\r\nfirst time with the pleasant \"music of the reel.\"  Almost before Frank\r\nhad time to take a step in a downward direction, fifty yards were run\r\nout, the waters were suddenly cleft, and a salmon sprang like a bar of\r\nburnished silver twice its own height into the air.  With a sounding\r\nsplash it returned to its native element; but scarcely had its fins\r\ntouched the water, when it darted towards the bank.  Being brought up\r\nsuddenly here, it turned at a tangent, and flashed across the pool\r\nagain, causing the reel to spin with renewed velocity.  Here the fish\r\npaused for a second, as if to collect its thoughts, and then coming,\r\napparently, to a summary determination as to what it meant to do, it\r\nbegan steadily to ascend the stream, not, indeed, so rapidly as it had\r\ndescended, but sufficiently so to give Frank some trouble, by means of\r\nrapidly winding up, to keep the line tight.  Having bored doggedly\r\ntowards the head of the rapid, the fish stopped and began to shake its\r\nhead passionately, as if indignant at being foiled in its energetic\r\nattempts to escape.  After a little time, it lay sulkily down at the\r\nbottom of the pool, where it defied its persecutor to move it an inch.\r\n\r\n\"What's to be done now?\" asked Stanley, who stood ready to gaff the fish\r\nwhen brought near to the bank.\r\n\r\n\"We must rouse him up,\" said Frank, as he slowly wound up the line.\r\n\"Just take up a stone and throw it at him.\"\r\n\r\nStanley looked surprised, for he imagined that such a proceeding would\r\nfrighten the fish and cause it to snap the line; but seeing that Frank\r\nwas in earnest, he did as he was directed.  No sooner had the stone sunk\r\nthan the startled fish once more dashed across the river; then taking a\r\ndownward course, it sped like an arrow to the brink of the rough water\r\nbelow.  To have allowed the salmon to go down the rapid would have been\r\nto lose it, so Frank arrested the spinning of his reel and held on.  For\r\na second or two the rod bent almost in a circle, and the line became\r\nfearfully rigid.\r\n\r\n\"You'll break it, Frank,\" cried Stanley, in some anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"It can't be helped,\" said Frank, compressing his lips; \"he must not go\r\ndown there.  The tackle is new; I think it will hold him.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately the tackle proved to be very good.  The fish was arrested,\r\nand after one or two short runs, which showed that its vigour was\r\nabated, it was drawn carefully towards the rocks.  As it drew near it\r\nrolled over on its side once or twice--an evident sign of being much\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Stanley, be careful,\" said Frank, as his friend stepped cautiously\r\ntowards the fish and extended the gaff.  \"I've seen many a fine salmon\r\nescape owing to careless gaffing.  Don't be in a hurry.  Be sure of your\r\ndistance before you strike, and do it quickly.  Now, then--there--give\r\nit him!  Hurrah!\" he shouted, as Stanley passed the iron hook neatly\r\ninto the side of the fish, and lifted it high and dry on the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe cheer to which Frank gave vent, on this successful termination to\r\nthe struggle, was re-echoed heartily by several of the men, who, on\r\npassing the spot with their loads, had paused and become deeply\r\ninterested spectators of the sport.\r\n\r\n\"Powerful big fish, sir,\" said Bryan, throwing down his pack and taking\r\nup the salmon by the gills.  \"Twinty pounds at laste, av it's an ounce.\"\r\n\r\n\"Scarcely that, Bryan,\" said Stanley; \"but it's not much less, I\r\nbelieve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! oui, 'tis ver' pritty.  Ver' superb for supper,\" remarked La Roche.\r\n\r\nThe little Frenchman was right in saying that it was pretty.  Unlike the\r\nordinary salmon, it was marked with spots like a trout, its head was\r\nsmall and its shoulders plump, while its silvery purity was exceedingly\r\ndazzling and beautiful.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a Hearne-salmon,\" said Massan, approaching the group.  \"I've seed\r\nlots o' them on the coast to the south'ard o' this, an' I've no doubt\r\nwe'll find plenty o' them at Ungava.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the men were discussing the merits of the fish, Frank had hooked\r\nanother, which, although quite as large, gave him much less trouble to\r\nland; and before the men had finished carrying the canoes and goods over\r\nthe portage, he had taken three fish out of the same pool.  Wishing,\r\nhowever, to try for a larger one nearer the sea, he proceeded to take a\r\ncast below the rapid.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, La Roche, whose activity had enabled him to carry over his\r\nportion of the cargo long before his comrades, came to the pool which\r\nFrank had just left, and seating himself on a large stone, drew forth\r\nhis tobacco-pouch.  With a comical leer at the water which had so\r\nrecently been deprived of its denizens, he proceeded leisurely to fill a\r\npipe.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to foresee, and difficult to account for, the actions\r\nof an impulsive human being.  La Roche sat down to smoke his pipe, but\r\ninstead of smoking it, he started to his feet and whirled it into the\r\nriver.  This apparently insane action was followed by several others,\r\nwhich, as they were successively performed, gradually unfolded the drift\r\nof his intentions.  Drawing the knife which hung at his girdle, he went\r\ninto the bushes, whence he quickly returned, dragging after him a large\r\nbranch.  From this he stripped the leaves and twigs.  Fumbling in his\r\npocket for some time, he drew forth a piece of stout cord, about four\r\nyards long, with a cod-hook attached to the end of it.  This line had\r\nbeen constructed some weeks before when the canoes were wind-bound at a\r\npart of the coast where La Roche, desirous of replenishing the kettle,\r\nhad made an unsuccessful attempt at sea-fishing.  Fastening this line to\r\nthe end of his extemporised rod, La Roche proceeded to dress his hook.\r\nThis he accomplished by means of the feather of a duck which Frank shot\r\nthe day before, and a tag from his scarlet worsted belt; and, when\r\nfinished, it had more the appearance of some hideous reptile than a gay\r\nfly.  However, La Roche surveyed it for a moment or two with an\r\nexpression of deep satisfaction, and then, hurrying to the brink of the\r\nwater, made a violent heave.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! cent milles tonnerres!\" he exclaimed angrily, as the enormous hook\r\ncaught in the leg of his trousers.  The large and clumsy barb was deeply\r\nimbedded, so there was no help for it but to use the knife.  The second\r\nthrow was more successful, and the hook alighted in the water with a\r\nsplash that ought to have sent all the fish in the pool away in\r\nconsternation.  Instead of this, however, no sooner did the reptile\r\ntrail upon the stream than a trout dashed at it in such violent haste\r\nthat it nearly missed it altogether.  As it was, it hooked itself very\r\nslightly, and the excitable Frenchman settled the matter by giving the\r\nline a violent tug, in his anxiety to land the fish, that pulled the\r\nhook entirely out of its mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! c'est dommage, ver' great; mais try it encore, my boy,\" exclaimed\r\nthe mortified angler.  The next throw, although well accomplished,\r\nproduced nothing; but at the third attempt, ere the reptile had settled\r\non the water for a second, it was engulfed by a salmon fully six pounds\r\nweight, and La Roche's rod was almost drawn out of his grasp.\r\n\r\n\"Hilloa, Losh! what have ye got there?\" exclaimed Bryan, as, with\r\nseveral of the men, he approached to where the Frenchman and the salmon\r\nstrove in uncertain conflict.\r\n\r\n\"By the mortial, he's hucked a whale!  Out with it, boy, afore it pulls\r\nye in!\" said the Irishman, running to the rescue.\r\n\r\nJust then the salmon gave a pull of more than ordinary vigour, at the\r\nsame moment La Roche slipped his foot, and, ere Bryan could lay hold of\r\nhim, fell headlong into the water and disappeared.  Bryan's hands hung\r\nhelplessly down, his jaw dropped, and his eyes opened wide, as he gazed\r\nin mute wonderment at the spot where his friend's toes had vanished.\r\nSuddenly he wrenched off his cap and flung it down, and proceeded to\r\ntear off his coat, preparatory to leaping into the river to the rescue,\r\nwhen his arms were pinioned to his sides by the powerful grip of Massan.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Bryan,\" said he, \"you know very well that you can't swim; you'd\r\nonly make things worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och! murder! _he_ can't swim neither.  Let me go, ye black villain.\r\nThunder an' turf! will ye see the poor lad drownded forenint yer two\r\neyes?\" cried the poor Irishman, as he made violent but unavailing\r\nstruggles to get free.  But Massan knew that to allow him to escape\r\nwould only add to the number requiring to be saved, and as he himself\r\ncould not swim, he saw at once that the only service he could render\r\nunder the circumstances would be to hold the Irishman down.  Clasping\r\nhim, therefore, as in a vice, he raised his head and gave a shout for\r\nhelp that rolled in deep echoes among the overhanging cliffs.  Another\r\nshout was uttered at the same instant.  Edith, who happened to come up\r\njust as La Roche's head emerged from the water gasping for breath,\r\nuttered a wild shriek that made more than one heart among the absentees\r\nleap as they flew to the rescue.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile La Roche rose and sank several times in the surges of the\r\npool.  His face on these occasions exhibited a mingled expression of\r\nterror and mischievous wildness; for although he could not swim a\r\nstroke, the very buoyancy of his mercurial temperament seemed partially\r\nto support him, and a feeling of desperate determination induced him to\r\nretain a death-like gripe of the rod, at the end of which the salmon\r\nstill struggled.  But his strength was fast going, and he sank for the\r\nfourth time with a bubbling cry, when a step was heard crashing through\r\nthe adjacent bushes, and Dick Prince sprang down the slope like a deer.\r\nHe did not pause when the scene burst upon his view, but a smile of\r\nsatisfaction played upon his usually grave face when he saw Edith safe\r\non the banks of the stream.  Another spring and an agile bound sent him\r\nheadlong into the pool about a yard from the spot where La Roche had\r\nlast sunk.  Scarcely had he disappeared when the dog Chimo bounded\r\ntowards the scene of action, and, with what intent no one could tell,\r\nleaped also into the water.  By this time Frank, Stanley, and nearly all\r\nthe party had assembled on the bank of the river, ready to render\r\nassistance.  In a few seconds they had the satisfaction of seeing Dick\r\nPrince rise, holding poor La Roche by the collar of his capote with his\r\nleft hand, while he swam vigorously towards the shore with his right.\r\nBut during the various struggles which had taken place they had been\r\ngradually sucked into the stream that flowed towards the lower rapid,\r\nand it now became apparent to Prince that his only chance of safety was\r\nin catching hold of the point of rock that formed the first obstruction\r\nto the rush of water.  Abandoning all effort, therefore, to gain the\r\nbank beside him, he swam with the current, but edged towards the shore\r\nas he floated down.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!  La Roche!\" he exclaimed loudly.  \"Do you hear? do you\r\nunderstand me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! oui, vraiment.  I not dead yit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let go that rod and seize my collar, and mind, sink deep in the\r\nwater.  Show only enough o' your face to breathe with, or I'll drown\r\nye.\"\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman obeyed to the extent of seizing Dick's collar and sinking\r\ndeep in the water, so as not to overburden his friend; but nothing could\r\ninduce him to quit the rod to which he had clung so long and so\r\nresolutely.  Prince's arms being now free, one or two powerful strokes\r\nplaced him beyond the influence of the strong current, and as he passed\r\nthe rocks before mentioned, he seized an overhanging branch of a small\r\nshrub, by which he endeavoured to drag himself ashore.  This, however,\r\nhe found to be impossible, partly owing to the steepness of the shelving\r\nrock, and partly to the fact that Chimo, in his ill-directed attempts to\r\nshare in the dangers of his friends, had seized La Roche by the skirts\r\nof the coat in order to prevent himself from going down the stream.\r\nThose on shore, on seeing Prince make for the rock, ran towards the\r\nspot; but having to make a slight detour round the bend of the river,\r\nthey did not reach it until he seized the branch, and when Frank, who\r\nwas the first, sprang down, the slope to the rescue, he found them\r\nstreaming out and waving to and fro in the current, like some monstrous\r\nreptile--Dick holding on to the branch with both hands, La Roche holding\r\non to Dick, Chimo holding on by his teeth to La Roche, and the\r\nunfortunate salmon holding on to the line which its half-drowned captor\r\nscorned to let go.\r\n\r\nA few seconds sufficed to drag them dripping from the stream; and the\r\nenergetic little Frenchman no sooner found his feet on solid ground than\r\nhe hauled out his fish and landed it triumphantly with his own hand.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a pretty fish, La Roche,\" said Frank, laughing, as he busied\r\nhimself in taking down his rod, while several of the men assisted Dick\r\nPrince to wring the water out of his clothes, and others crowded round\r\nLa Roche to congratulate him on his escape--\"'tis a pretty fish, but it\r\ncost you some trouble to catch it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Throuble, indeed!\" echoed Bryan, as he sat on a rock smoking his pipe;\r\n\"troth it's more nor him came to throuble by that same fish: it guve me\r\nthe throuble o' bein' more nor half choked by Massan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Half choked, Bryan! what mean you?\" asked Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Mane?  I just mane what I say; an' the raison why's best known to\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\nA loud peal of laughter greeted Massan's graphic explanation of the\r\nforcible manner in which he had prevented the Irishman from throwing\r\nhimself into the river.\r\n\r\nThe party now turned earnestly to the more serious duties of the\r\njourney.  Already too much time had been lost in this \"playing\r\nthemselves with fish,\" as Stanley expressed it, and it behoved them to\r\nembark as speedily as possible.  About a mile above the pool which had\r\nnearly proved fatal to La Roche was the head of a series of\r\ninsurmountable rapids, which extended all the way down to the waterfall.\r\nBeyond this was a pretty long reach of calm water, up which they\r\nproceeded easily; but as they advanced the current became so strong that\r\nno headway could be made with the paddles, and it was found necessary to\r\nsend a party of the men ashore with a long line, by means of which the\r\ncanoes were slowly dragged against the current.  At length they came to\r\nshallow water, which necessitated another portage; and as it was about\r\nsunset when they reached it, Stanley ordered the tent to be pitched for\r\nthe night, and the fire lighted, under the shadow of a stupendous\r\nmountain, the rocky sides of which were sprinkled with dwarf pine trees,\r\nand partially covered with brush and herbage.  Here Edith and her mother\r\ndiscovered multitudes of berries, the most numerous being cloud and crow\r\nberries; both of which were found to be good, especially the former, and\r\na fragrant dish of these graced the towel that evening at supper.\r\n\r\nThus, day by day, our adventurous travellers penetrated deeper and\r\ndeeper into the heart of the wilderness, which became more savage and\r\nmountainous as they left the coast.  Stanley drew forth his quadrant and\r\ncompass, wherewith he guided the party towards their future home.  At\r\nnight, after the labour of the day was over, he and Frank would spread\r\ntheir charts in the blaze of the camp fire, and study the positions of\r\nthe land so far as it was laid down; while Edith sat beside her mother,\r\nhelping her to repair the torn and way-worn habiliments of her husband\r\nand Frank, or listening with breathless interest to the men, as they\r\nrecounted their experiences of life in the different regions through\r\nwhich they had travelled.  Many of these tales were more or less\r\ncoloured by the fancy of the narrators, but most of them were founded on\r\nfact, and proved an unfailing source of deep interest to the little\r\nchild.  Frank's fishing-rod was frequently in requisition, and often\r\nsupplied the party with more than enough of excellent fish; and at every\r\nnew bend and turn of the innumerable lakes and rivers through which they\r\npassed, reindeer were seen bounding on the mountain-sides, or trotting\r\ndown the ravines to quench their thirst and cool their sides in the\r\nwaters; so that food was abundant, and their slender stock of provisions\r\nhad not to be trenched upon, while the berries that grew luxuriantly\r\neverywhere proved a grateful addition to their store.  Thus, day by day,\r\nthey slowly retreated farther and farther from the world of mankind--\r\nliving in safety under the protection of the Almighty, and receiving the\r\ndaily supply of all their necessities from His fatherly and bountiful\r\nhand; thus, day by day, they rose with the sun, and lay down at night to\r\nrest upon the mountain's side or by the river's bank; and thus, day by\r\nday, they penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of the unknown\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nA NEW SCENE--THE ESQUIMAU--DEER-SLAYING--ENEMIES IN THE BUSH.\r\n\r\nTurn we now to another, a more distant, and a wilder scene.  Near the\r\nbleak shores of Hudson's Straits there flows a river which forms an\r\noutlet to the superfluous waters of the almost unknown territory lying\r\nbetween the uninhabited parts of Labrador and that tract of desert land\r\nwhich borders Hudson's Bay on the east, and is known to the fur-traders\r\nby the appellation of East Main.  This river is called the Caniapuscaw,\r\nand discharges itself into Ungava Bay.\r\n\r\nThe scene to which we would turn the reader's attention is upwards of\r\ntwenty miles from the mouth of this river, at a particular bend, where\r\nthe stream spreads itself out into a sheet of water almost worthy of\r\nbeing called a lake, and just below which two bold cliffs shut out the\r\nseaward view, and cause an abrupt narrowing of the river.  The scene is\r\npeculiar, and surpassingly grand.  On each side of the stream majestic\r\nmountains raise their bald and rugged peaks almost into the clouds.\r\nLittle herbage grows on the more exposed places, and nothing, save here\r\nand there a stunted and weather-worn pine, breaks the sharp outline of\r\nthe cliffs.  But in the gorges and dark ravines--for there are no\r\nvalleys--clumps of small-sized spruce--fir and larch trees throw a\r\nsoftness over some of the details of a spot whose general aspect is one\r\nof sterility.  The mountains rise in a succession of irregular steps or\r\nterraces, whose faces are so precipitous that they cannot be ascended.\r\nTo accomplish the feat of scaling the mountain-tops it would be\r\nnecessary to clamber up a ravine until the first terrace should be\r\ngained, then, walking along that, ascend the next ravine, and so on.  At\r\nthe upper end of the lake (as we shall hereafter call this wide part of\r\nthe river) lies a low island, fringed with a scanty growth of willows;\r\nand not far from this, on the eastern bank of the river, lies a small\r\npatch of level sand.  This spot is somewhat peculiar, inasmuch as it is\r\nbacked by a low platform of rock, whose surface is smooth as a table.\r\nAt the foot of this rock bubbles a little spring, which, meandering\r\nthrough a tangled spot of stunted shrubbery ere it mingles with the\r\nsand, gives unusual green-ness and vitality to the surrounding herbage.\r\nOn the edge of this rocky platform sat the figure of a man.\r\n\r\nIt was evening.  The declining sun shot its last few rays over the brow\r\nof the opposite mountains, and bathed him in mellow light, as he sat\r\napparently contemplating the scene before him.  The man's costume\r\nbespoke him a native of the savage region in the midst of which he\r\nseemed the only human being.  But although an Esquimau, he exhibited\r\nseveral physical peculiarities not commonly supposed to belong to that\r\npeople.  To an altitude of six feet three he added a breadth of shoulder\r\nand expansion of chest seldom equalled among men of more highly-favoured\r\nclimes; and his real bulk being very greatly increased by his costume,\r\nhe appeared to be a very giant--no unfitting tenant of such giant\r\nscenery.  The said costume consisted of an extremely loose coat or shirt\r\nof deerskin, having the hair outside, and a capacious hood, which\r\nusually hung down behind, but covered his head at this time, in order to\r\nprotect it from a sharp north-west breeze that whirled among the gullies\r\nof the mountains, and surging down their sides, darkened the surface of\r\nthe water.  A pair of long sealskin boots encased his limbs from foot to\r\nthigh; and a little wallet or bag of sealskin, with the hair outside,\r\nhung from his shoulders.  Simple although this costume was, it had a\r\nbulky rotundity of appearance that harmonised well with the giant's\r\nfrank, good-humoured countenance, which was manly, firm, and massive,\r\nbesides being rosy, oily, and fat.  In the latter peculiarity he partook\r\nof the well-known characteristic of his tribe; but the effeminacy in\r\nappearance that is produced by a round, fat face was done away in the\r\ncase of our giant by a remarkably black though as yet downy moustache\r\nand beard, of a length suitable to twenty-three winters.  His hair was\r\nlong, straight, and black, besides being uncommonly glossy--an effect\r\nattributable to the prevalence of whale-oil in these regions.  On the\r\nforehead the locks were cut short, so as to afford free scope to his\r\nblack eyes and sturdy-looking nose.  By his side lay a long hunting\r\nspear, and a double-bladed paddle, fully fifteen feet long; which latter\r\nbelonged to a kayak, or Esquimau canoe, that lay on the sand close to\r\nthe water's edge.  Sitting there, motionless as the rocks around him,\r\nthe giant looked like a colossal statue of an Esquimau.  He was no\r\nfigure of stone, however, but a veritable human being, as was proved by\r\nhis starting suddenly from his reverie and hastening towards the spring\r\nbefore mentioned, at which he stooped and drank rapidly, like one who\r\nhad to make up for lost time.\r\n\r\nAfter a few hurried gulps, the man strode towards his canoe; but as he\r\nwent his restless eye became fixed on the branching antlers of a deer,\r\nthat were tossed in the air on the summit of a neighbouring cliff.  Like\r\none who is suddenly paralysed, the Esquimau stood transfixed in the\r\nattitude in which he had been arrested.  He did not even seem to\r\nbreathe, as the antlers moved to and fro, clearly defined against the\r\nblue sky.  At length they disappeared, and the animal to which they\r\nbelonged slowly descended a ravine towards the river.  Then, as if set\r\nfree from a spell, the man glided into his kayak, and swept rapidly but\r\nnoiselessly behind a projecting point of rock, where he waited patiently\r\ntill the deer took to the water.  He had not long to wait, however, for\r\nin a few minutes afterwards the deer, followed by several companions,\r\nwalked out upon the patch of sand, snuffed the air once or twice, and\r\nentered the stream with the intention of crossing.\r\n\r\nBut there was an enemy near whom they little dreamed of--not an enemy\r\nwho would dash excitedly into the midst of them, or awaken the thunders\r\nof the place with his noisy gun, but a foe who could patiently bide his\r\ntime, and take cool and quiet advantage of it when it came.  When the\r\ndeer had proceeded about a hundred yards into the river, the Esquimau\r\ndipped his paddle twice, and the narrow, sharp-pointed canoe, which, at\r\na short distance, seemed little more than a floating plank, darted\r\nthrough the water and ranged alongside of the startled animals.  The\r\nfattest of the herd was separated from its fellows and driven towards\r\nthe shore from which it had started, while the others struggled across\r\nthe river.  Once or twice the separated deer endeavoured to turn to\r\nrejoin its comrades--an attempt which was frustrated by the Esquimau,\r\nwho could paddle infinitely faster over the water in his skin canoe than\r\nthe deer could swim.  As they neared the shore, the giant cast on it one\r\nor two glances, and having made up his mind as to the most convenient\r\nspot for landing, he urged the point of his canoe between the antlers of\r\nthe deer, and steered it in this manner to the sand-bank.  The deer,\r\nthus directed, had no resource but to land where its persecutor chose;\r\nbut no sooner did its foot touch ground, than it sprang convulsively\r\nforward in the vain hope to escape.  The same instant its captor's canoe\r\nshot beside it.  Grasping the long lance before mentioned in his hand,\r\nhe placed its glittering point on the deer's side, tickled it slowly to\r\nascertain that it was between two ribs, and, with a quick thrust,\r\nstabbed it to the heart.  A convulsive shudder, as the deer's head sank\r\nin the stream, proved that, though cold-blooded in appearance, the\r\naction was more effective and less cruel than many other more approved\r\nmethods of killing game.\r\n\r\nOur Esquimau thought neither of the method of slaying his deer nor of\r\nman's opinion regarding it.  His sole object was to procure supper,\r\nhaving tasted nothing since early morning; and the manner in which he\r\nate showed at once the strength of his appetite and his total\r\nindifference to cookery, for he ate it raw.  There was a certain\r\nappearance of haste in all his actions which, however, seemed\r\nunaccountable, considering the peaceful nature of the vast solitudes\r\naround him.  Scarcely had he cut off and devoured a portion of the deer\r\nthan he hastened again to his canoe, and darted like an arrow from the\r\nshore.  This is no exaggerated simile.  The long, thin, sharp Esquimau\r\nkayak is highly suggestive of an arrow in its form, and much more so in\r\nits extraordinary speed.  It consists of an extremely light framework of\r\nwood covered with sealskin parchment, which is stretched upon it all\r\nover as tight as a drum.  The top of the canoe being covered as well as\r\nthe bottom, it is thus, as it were, decked; and a small hole in the\r\nmiddle of this deck admits its occupant.  The kayak can only hold one\r\nperson.  The paddle, as already said, is a long pole with a blade at\r\neach end.  It is dipped alternately on each side, and is used not only\r\nto propel the kayak, but to prevent it from upsetting.  Indeed, so\r\nliable is it to upset that nothing but the wonderful adroitness of its\r\noccupant prevents it from doing so with every swing of his body.\r\n\r\nQuick, however, though the kayak sped over the rippling wave, it could\r\nnot have escaped the messenger of death that seemed about to be\r\ndispatched after it by a dark-skinned, red-painted Indian, who, at the\r\nmoment the vessel left the shore, leapt from behind a rocky point, and,\r\nlevelling a long gun, took a steady aim at the unconscious Esquimau.  A\r\nlittle puff of powder answered to the click of the lock, as the gun\r\nmissed fire.  With an exclamation of anger the savage seized his\r\npowder-horn to reprime, when a rude grasp was laid on his shoulder, and\r\nanother Indian, who, from the eagle feather in his hair, and his general\r\nbearing, appeared to be a chief, exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"Fool! you have the impatience of a woman, and you have not yet shown\r\nthat you have the heart of a man.  Would the scalp of yon\r\nEater-of-raw-flesh pay us for coming so far from our hunting-grounds?\r\nIf your gun had spoken among these mountains, we would have found the\r\nempty wigwams of his people, instead of fringing our belts with their\r\nscalps.\"\r\n\r\nWith a frown of anger the chief turned on his heel and retraced his\r\nsteps into the ravine from which he had emerged, followed by his abashed\r\nand silent companion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Esquimau, ignorant of the fate from which he had just\r\nescaped, continued to ply his paddle with right good will.  The little\r\ncraft, obedient to the powerful impulse, combined as it was with the\r\ncurrent of the ebb-tide, flew rather than floated toward the narrows,\r\nthrough which it passed, and opened up a view of the ice-encumbered\r\nwaters of Ungava Bay.  Directing his course along the western shores of\r\nthe river, the Esquimau speedily reached the coast at a point where\r\nseveral low, rough-built summer huts clustered near the shore.  Here he\r\nran his kayak into a little creek, and, having lifted it beyond tide\r\nmark, betook himself to his dwelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nSAVAGE LOVE--A WIFE PURCHASED--THE ATTACK--THE FLIGHT--THE ESCAPE--THE\r\nWOUNDED MAN.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the stout Esquimau proceeded a few steps along the shore,\r\nwhen he was met by a young girl who laid her hand on his arm.  Taking\r\nher gently by the shoulders, he drew her towards him and kissed her on\r\nboth cheeks--an action which caused her to blush deeply as, with a half\r\nsmile half frown on her face, she pushed him away.\r\n\r\nLove is the same all the world over, whether it glows beneath the\r\nbroad-cloth and spotless linen of a civilised gentleman, or under the\r\ndeerskin coat of a savage.  And its expression, we suspect, is somewhat\r\nsimilar everywhere.  The coy repulse of pretended displeasure came as\r\nnaturally from our plump little arctic heroine as it could have done\r\nfrom the most civilised flirt, and was treated with well-simulated\r\ncontrition by our arctic giant, as they walked slowly towards the huts.\r\nBut the Esquimau had other matters than love in his head just then, and\r\nthe girl's face assumed a grave and somewhat anxious look as he\r\ncontinued to whisper in her ear.\r\n\r\nAt the little hamlet they separated, and the maiden went to her\r\ngrandfather's abode; while her lover, lifting the skin-curtain door of a\r\nrudely-constructed hut, entered his own humble dwelling.  The room was\r\nempty, and its owner did not seem as if he meant to cheer it with his\r\npresence long.  In one corner lay a pile of miscellaneous articles,\r\nwhich he removed, and, taking the tusk of a walrus which lay near his\r\nhand, began to dig with it in the sand.  In a few seconds it struck a\r\nhard substance, and the Esquimau, putting his hand into the hole, drew\r\nforth a glittering axe, upon which he gazed with supreme satisfaction.\r\n\r\nNow be it known to you, reader, that among the Esquimaux of the frozen\r\nnorth iron is regarded with about as much delight as gold is by\r\nourselves.  And the reason is simple enough.  These poor people live\r\nentirely upon the produce of the chase.  Polar bears, seals, walruses,\r\nand whales are their staff of life.  To procure these animals, spears\r\nare necessary; to skin and cut them up, knives are needful.  But bone\r\nand stone make sorry knives and spears; so that, when a bit of iron, no\r\nmatter how poor its quality or small its size, can be obtained, it is\r\nlooked on as the most valuable of possessions; and the ingenuity\r\ndisplayed by Esquimaux in fashioning the rudest piece of metal into the\r\nmost useful of implements is truly astonishing, proving, in the most\r\nsatisfactory way, that necessity is indeed the mother of invention.  The\r\nprecious metal is obtained in two ways: by the discovery of a wreck,\r\nwhich is extremely rare; and by barter with those tribes which sometimes\r\nvisit the Moravian settlements of Labrador.  But neither source is very\r\nproductive.  Even a nail is treasured as a blessing, while an axe is a\r\nfortune!  When our giant, therefore, drew forth the shining implement,\r\nand gazed with delight at its keen edge, he experienced as great\r\nsatisfaction as a miser does when gloating over his banker's book!\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied himself that the axe was free from all approximation to\r\nrust, he stuck it into a belt of raw hide, which he put on for the\r\nexpress purpose of sustaining it, as Esquimaux do not generally wear\r\nbelts.  He then sallied forth, and walked with the air of a man who\r\nwears the grand cross of the Legion of Honour.  As he went to the hut in\r\nwhich lived the oldest man of the tribe, the shade of anxiety, which had\r\nclouded his brow more than once during the day, again rested on his\r\nface.  On entering, he observed the old Esquimau listening with anxious\r\ncountenance to the young girl whom we have already introduced to the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nNow this girl--Aneetka by name--was by no means an angel in Esquimau\r\nhabiliments.  Among civilised folk probably she would not have been\r\ndeemed even pretty.  Nevertheless, in the eyes of her lover she was most\r\ndecidedly beautiful, and round, and fat, and rosy, and young, awkward,\r\nand comfortable!  And the giant loved her--never so strongly, perhaps,\r\nas when he saw her striving to allay the fears of her old grandfather.\r\nBut this same grandfather was obstinate.  He wanted her to become the\r\nwife of an Esquimau who lived far to the westward, and who once had\r\ndealings with the fur-traders, and from whom he expected to derive\r\nconsiderable advantages and gifts of bits of hoop-iron and nails.  But\r\n_she_ wanted to become the giant's wife; so there the matter stood.\r\n\r\n\"The spirits o' the wind and sea protect us, and may the god o' the mist\r\ncover us!\" said the old man, as the young Esquimau sat down on a dead\r\nseal beside him.  \"Is it true that you saw the men of fire?\"\r\n\r\nThis was, of course, said in the language of the Esquimaux, and we\r\nrender it as literally as possible.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is true,\" replied the young man.  \"I saw them at the rapid\r\nwater in Caniapuscaw, and I took kayak to bring the news.\"\r\n\r\nVarious exclamations of mingled surprise and anger escaped from the\r\ncompressed lips of several stalwart natives, who had crowded into the\r\ntent on hearing of the arrival of their comrade.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued the young man, \"we must go away this night.  They had\r\nfire-tubes, and there were thirty men.  We have only ten.\"\r\n\r\nAgain a murmur ran through the listeners, but no one spoke for a few\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\n\"Did they see you?\" asked the old man anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No.  I came on them suddenly, when I was chasing deer, and almost ran\r\ninto their camp; but I saw, and fell in the grass.  I thought the chief\r\nraised his head quickly when I fell; but he looked down again, and I\r\ncrawled away.\"\r\n\r\nIn this the young Esquimau was mistaken.  He knew little of the craft\r\nand the quickness of the Red Indian, and easily fell into the snare of\r\nhis savage enemy, who, having been momentarily startled by the sudden\r\nsound of the Esquimau approach, had endeavoured to throw him off his\r\nguard, by pretending that although he heard the sound he thought nothing\r\nof it.  But no sooner had the Esquimau retired than he was closely\r\nfollowed and watched by the whole party.  They could have easily shot\r\nhim, but refrained from doing so, that he might unwittingly be their\r\nguide to the habitations of his people.  The rapid flight of his kayak\r\ndistanced his pursuers at first, but they made up for this during an\r\nhour or two in the night, when the tired Esquimau allowed himself a\r\nshort season of repose to recruit his energies for the following day's\r\njourney.  During this period the Indians shot far ahead of him, and when\r\nhe arrived at the coast next day they were not much in the rear.\r\n\r\n\"And now, old man,\" said our young Esquimau, \"it is time that I should\r\nhave my wife.  If the Allat [see note 1] come here to-night, as I know\r\nthey will, I want to have a right to defend her, and carry her away when\r\nwe flee.  Are you willing?\"\r\n\r\nThe young giant said this with a degree of roughness and decision that\r\nat any other time would have made the obstinate old grandfather refuse\r\npoint blank; but as there was every probability of having to flee for\r\nhis life ere the break of another day, and as his old heart trembled\r\nwithin him at the thought of the dreaded guns of the Indians, he merely\r\nshook his head and pondered a little.\r\n\r\n\"What will you give me?\" he said, looking up.\r\n\r\nThe young man answered by drawing the axe from his belt and laying it on\r\nthe ground before him.  The old man's eyes glistened with pleasure as he\r\nsurveyed the costly gift.\r\n\r\n\"Good; that will do.  Take her and go.\"\r\n\r\nA second bidding was not needed.  The young man arose hastily, took his\r\nblushing bride by the hand, and led her from the tent of her grandfather\r\ntowards his own.  Here she set to work instantly to assist her husband\r\nin hurriedly packing up their goods and chattels; and, immediately\r\nafterwards, the little village became a perfect Babel of confusion, as\r\nthe alarmed inhabitants, on learning the threatened danger, prepared for\r\ninstant flight.  In less than an hour the most of them were ready.  The\r\nmen launched their kayaks, while the women, having loaded their oomiaks\r\nwith their goods, tossed their dogs and children on the top of them.\r\n\r\nThe oomiak, or women's boat, is quite a different affair from the kayak,\r\nin which the men travel singly.  It is usually made large and capacious,\r\nin order to hold the entire household of the Esquimau.  Like the kayak\r\nit is made of skin, but has no covering above, and is propelled by means\r\nof short single-bladed paddles, which are worked by the women, upon whom\r\ndevolves the entire care and management of the oomiak.  It is a clumsy\r\naffair to look at, but, like the boats of savages generally, it is\r\nuncommonly useful and a good sea-boat.\r\n\r\nWhile the Esquimaux were busied in completing their arrangements, one of\r\nthe dogs rushed towards the bushes that lined the shore just behind the\r\nvillage, and barked vociferously.  Instantly it was joined by the whole\r\npack, and the Esquimaux, who, ever since they had heard of the proximity\r\nof their Indian foes, were in a state of the utmost trepidation, made a\r\ngeneral rush towards their canoes.  Before they reached them, however, a\r\nvolley of musketry was fired from the bushes, and three of their\r\nnumber--a man and two women--filled the air with their death-shriek, as\r\nthey fell dead upon the beach; while the Indians sprang from their\r\nconcealment, and, brandishing their knives and tomahawks, rushed with a\r\nfearful yell upon the terror-stricken Esquimaux.\r\n\r\nShrill and terrible though the Indian war-cry is proverbially known to\r\nbe, it was excelled in appalling wildness by the shriek which arose from\r\nthe Esquimaux, as they hurried tumultuously into their canoes and put\r\noff to sea.  These poor creatures were naturally brave--much more so,\r\nindeed, than their assailants; but the murderous effects of the terrible\r\ngun caused the sternest brow among them to blanch and the stoutest heart\r\nto quail.  The arrow and the spear, however rapid, could be avoided, if\r\nobserved in time; but this dreaded implement of destruction was so\r\nmysterious to them, and its death-dealing bullet so quick, and the\r\nsmoke, the fire, and the loud report so awful, that they shuddered even\r\nwhen they thought of it.  No wonder, then, that they uttered a\r\ndespairing cry when it actually sounded in their ears.\r\n\r\nWhen the dogs first gave tongue, our tall Esquimau was alone in his hut,\r\nhaving just sent his wife down with a bundle to the oomiak.  When the\r\nvolley rang in his ears, he rushed towards the beach, supposing that she\r\nwas there before him.  This was not the case, however.  Aneetka had gone\r\ntowards her grandfather's hut, and when the Indians fired she rushed in\r\nto assist him to fly.  But the old man was already gone.  Turning\r\ninstantly, she sprang nimbly towards the shore.  At that moment a single\r\nshot was fired, and she saw her husband stumble forward and fall\r\nheadlong to the earth, where he lay motionless.  Her first impulse was\r\nto run towards the body and throw herself upon it; but this intention\r\nwas effectually checked by a strong, dark-skinned arm which encircled\r\nher waist, and, despite her cries and struggles, bore her away into the\r\nbushes.  Her captor was the Indian whose gun once before on that day had\r\nbeen levelled at her lover's head.\r\n\r\nWhen the young Esquimau fell, as already related, he was so close to the\r\nwater that he stumbled into it, and, fortunately, not a yard distant\r\nfrom an oomiak which the women were frantically thrusting into the sea.\r\nThey had no time to lift so heavy a weight on board, but, as the light\r\ncraft darted from the shore, an old woman, who had often received kind\r\nattentions from the good-natured youth, leant over the stern and seized\r\nhim by the hair.  In this manner he was dragged through the water until\r\nthey were out of gun-shot, when he was lifted inside and laid beside the\r\ndogs and children.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Indians had rushed into the water up to their middle, in\r\nthe hope of catching the last of the little fleet, but without success.\r\nMad with disappointed rage, they waded back to the shore, and, standing\r\nin a line along the edge of the waves, reloaded their guns with the\r\nutmost rapidity.  The poor Esquimaux knew well what would follow, and\r\nstrained every nerve to increase their distance.  Once more the guns\r\nbelched forth their leaden shower, which went skipping over the water\r\ntowards the flotilla.  Only one kayak was hit by the discharge.  It was\r\nthat of the old grandfather already mentioned.  The ball ripped up the\r\nside of the canoe, which filled and upset, and the poor old man would\r\ncertainly have been drowned but for the opportune coming up of the\r\noomiak containing his wounded grandson.  The old woman who had already\r\nsaved the life of the young giant of the tribe, again put forth her\r\nskinny hand and grasped the patriarch, who was soon hauled on board in\r\nsafety.  A few minutes more placed the whole party out of danger.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Indians, furious with disappointment, scalped the\r\nthree dead bodies and tossed them into the sea; after which they went\r\ninto the huts in order to collect all the valuables that might have been\r\nleft behind.  Very little, however, was to be found, as the entire\r\nproperty of an Esquimau is not worth much to a red man.  The most useful\r\nthing they laid hands on was the axe which the old grandfather had left\r\nbehind in his hurried flight.  Having taken all they could carry, the\r\nsavages destroyed the rest; and then, setting fire to the village, they\r\nreturned to the bush.  Here a fire was made, and a council of war held.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indian who had captured the Esquimau girl led her forward\r\ntowards the fire, there was a general yell of indignation.  Tomahawks\r\nwere grasped, and more than one knife was unsheathed.  But the chief\r\ncommanded silence.\r\n\r\n\"What does White Heart mean to do with the Eater-of-raw-flesh?\" he\r\ninquired, turning to the young man.\r\n\r\n\"He will take her to the hunting-grounds of the Crees.\"\r\n\r\n\"That cannot be,\" said the chief.  \"The girl must die, and White Heart\r\nmust kill her.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man made no reply.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" continued the chief sarcastically, \"White Heart is afraid to see\r\nblood on his knife, another warrior will show him how to do it!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, a dark-visaged savage drew his scalping-knife, and, with\r\none stride, stood beside the trembling girl, who, during the\r\nconsultation of the savages, had stood silently beside her captor\r\nlistening intently to the words which she did not comprehend.\r\n\r\nSeizing her by the shoulder, the savage plunged his knife at her bosom;\r\nbut, ere the keen point reached it, the arm was caught by the young\r\nIndian, and the scowling savage was hurled violently back.  With dilated\r\neye and expanded nostril, the young man, not deigning to bestow a glance\r\nupon his fallen comrade, turned to his chief and said--\r\n\r\n\"Did not I take her?  The girl is mine.  I will carry her to my tent and\r\nmake her my _wife_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so,\" replied the chief abruptly.  Then turning to his followers,\r\nhe gave orders to start immediately.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes all was ready.  The chief led the way into the bush.\r\nThe Esquimau girl and her captor followed; and the whole band, silently\r\nand in single file, commenced to retrace their steps to the far distant\r\nhunting-grounds of the Cree Indians.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNote 1.  Esquimau name for Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE PURSUIT--SEAL-SPEARING--THE GIANT'S DESPAIR.\r\n\r\nWhen the young Esquimau began to recover from the lethargic state into\r\nwhich his wound had thrown him, he found himself lying at the bottom of\r\nthe women's oomiak with his old grandfather by his side, and a noisy\r\ncrew of children and dogs around him.  Raising himself on his elbow, he\r\nbrushed the clotted blood and hair from his temples, and endeavoured to\r\nrecall his scattered faculties.  Seeing this, the old crone who had\r\nsaved his life laid down her paddle and handed him a sealskin cup of\r\nwater, which he seized and drank with avidity.  Fortunately the wound on\r\nhis forehead, although it had stunned him severely at first, was\r\ntrifling, and in a few minutes after partaking of the cool water, he\r\nrecovered sufficiently to sit up and look around him.\r\n\r\nGradually his faculties returned, and he started up with a troubled\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n\"Where are the Allat?  Where is my wife?\" he exclaimed vehemently, as\r\nhis eye fell on the prostrate form of his still insensible grandfather.\r\n\r\n\"Gone,\" answered several of the women.\r\n\r\n\"Gone!\" repeated the youth, gazing wildly among the faces around him in\r\nsearch of that of his wife.  \"Gone!  Tell me, is she in one of the other\r\noomiaks?\"\r\n\r\nThe women trembled as they answered, \"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have the Allat got her?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no reply to this question, but he did not need one.  Springing\r\nlike a tiger to the stern of the oomiak, he seized the steering paddle,\r\nand turning the head of the boat towards the shore, paddled with all his\r\nenergy.  Nearly two hours had elapsed since they had commenced their\r\nflight, and as all danger of pursuit was over the moment the Indians\r\nturned their backs on the sea, the Esquimaux had gradually edged\r\nin-shore again, so that a few minutes sufficed to run the prow of the\r\noomiak on the shingle of the beach.  Without saying a word, the young\r\nman sprang over the side, drew a hunting-spear from the bottom of the\r\nboat, and hurried back in the direction of the deserted village at the\r\ntop of his speed.  The women knew that nothing could stop him, and\r\nfeeling that he was quite able to take care of himself, they quietly put\r\nto sea again, and continued their voyage.\r\n\r\nThe limbs of the young Esquimau, as we have already said, were gigantic\r\nand powerful, enabling him to traverse the country at a pace which few\r\nof his fellows could keep up with; and although a stern-chase is\r\nproverbially a long one, and the distance between two parties travelling\r\nin opposite directions is amazingly increased in a short space of time,\r\nthere is no doubt that he would have overtaken his Indian foes ere many\r\nhours had passed, but for the wound in his head, which, although not\r\ndangerous, compelled him more than once to halt and sit down, in order\r\nto prevent himself from falling into a swoon.  Hunger had also something\r\nto do with this state of weakness, as he had eaten nothing for many\r\nhours.  In his hasty departure from the boat, however, he had neglected\r\nto take any provisions with him, so that he had little hope of obtaining\r\nrefreshment before arriving at the village, where some scraps might\r\nperhaps be picked up.\r\n\r\nSlowly, and with a reeling brain, he staggered on; but here no relief\r\nawaited him, for every scrap of food had been either taken away or\r\ndestroyed by the Indians, and it was with a heavy sigh and a feeling\r\nakin to despair that he sat down beside the blackened ruins of his late\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nBut Esquimaux, more than other men, are accustomed to reverses of\r\nfortune, and the sigh with which he regarded the ruins of his hut had no\r\nreference whatever to the absence of food.  He knew that about this time\r\nthe mouth of the river would be full of ice, carried up by the\r\nflood-tide, and that seals would, in all probability, be found on it; so\r\nhe started up, and hastening along the beach soon gained the floes,\r\nwhich he examined carefully.  A glance or two sufficed to show him that\r\nhe was right in his conjecture.  On a sheet of ice not more than a\r\ncouple of hundred yards from shore were two seals fast asleep.  These he\r\nprepared to stalk.  Between the floe and the shore ran a stream of water\r\ntwenty yards broad.  Over this he ferried himself on a lump of loose\r\nice; and, on reaching the floe, he went down on his hands and knees,\r\nholding the spear in his right hand as he advanced cautiously towards\r\nhis victim.\r\n\r\nThe Esquimau seal-spear is a curious weapon, and exhibits in a high\r\ndegree the extraordinary ingenuity of the race.  The handle is sometimes\r\nmade of the horn of the narwal, but more frequently of wood.  It has a\r\nmovable head or barb, to which a long line of walrus hide or sealskin is\r\nattached.  This barb is made of ivory tipped with iron, and is attached\r\nto the handle in such a way that it becomes detached from it the instant\r\nthe animal is struck, and remains firmly imbedded in the wound with the\r\nline fastened to it, while the handle floats away on the water or falls\r\non the ice, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nWhen the Esquimau had approached to within a hundred yards, he lay down\r\nat full length and slowly worked himself forward.  Meanwhile the seals\r\nraised their heads, but seeing, as they imagined, a companion coming\r\ntowards them, they did not make for their holes, which were a few yards\r\ndistant from them.  Having drawn near enough to render the animals\r\nsuspicious, the young giant now sprang up, rushed forward, and got\r\nbetween one seal and its hole just as its more active companion dived\r\ninto the water.  In another moment the deadly lance transfixed its side\r\nand killed it.  This was a fortunate supply to the Esquimau, whose\r\npowers of endurance were fast failing.  He immediately sat down on his\r\nvictim, and cutting a large steak from its side, speedily made a meal\r\nthat far exceeded the powers of any alderman whatsoever!  It required\r\nbut a short time to accomplish, however, and a shorter time to transfer\r\nseveral choice [junks] chunks to his wallet; with which replenished\r\nstore he resumed his journey.\r\n\r\nAlthough the man's vigour was restored for a time, so that he travelled\r\nwith great speed, it did not last long, owing to the wound in his head,\r\nwhich produced frequent attacks of giddiness, and at last compelled him,\r\nmuch against his will, to halt for a couple of hours' repose.  Glancing\r\nround, in order to select a suitable camping ground, he soon observed\r\nsuch a spot in the form of a broad, overhanging ledge of rock, beneath\r\nwhich there was a patch of scrubby underwood.  Here he lay down with the\r\nseal blubber for a pillow, and was quickly buried in deep, untroubled\r\nslumber.  In little more than two hours he awoke with a start, and,\r\nafter a second application to the contents of the wallet, resumed his\r\nsolitary march.  The short rest seemed to have quite restored his wonted\r\nvigour, for he now stalked up the banks of the river at a rate which\r\nseemed only to accelerate as he advanced.  As has been already said,\r\nthese banks were both rugged and precipitous.  In some places the rocks\r\njutted out into the water, forming promontories over which it was\r\ndifficult to climb; and frequently these capes terminated in abrupt\r\nprecipices, necessitating a detour in order to advance.  In other places\r\nthe coast was indented with sandy bays, which more than doubled the\r\ndistance the traveller would have had to accomplish had he possessed a\r\nkayak.  Unfortunately in his hasty departure he neglected to take one\r\nwith him; but he did his best to atone for this oversight by making\r\nalmost superhuman exertions.  He strode over the sands like an ostrich\r\nof the desert, and clambered up the cliffs and over the rocks--looking,\r\nin his hairy garments, like a shaggy polar bear.  The thought of his\r\nyoung and pretty bride a captive in the hands of his bitterest foes, and\r\ndoomed to a life of slavery, almost maddened him, and caused his dark\r\neye to flash and his broad bosom to heave with pent-up emotion, while it\r\nspurred him on to put forth exertions that were far beyond the powers of\r\nany member of his tribe, and could not, under less exciting\r\ncircumstances, have been performed even by himself.  As to what were his\r\nintentions should he overtake the Indians, he knew not.  The agitation\r\nof his spirits, combined with the influence of his wound, induced him to\r\nact from impulse; and the wild tumult of his feelings prevented him from\r\ncalculating the consequences or perceiving the hopelessness of an attack\r\nmade by one man, armed only with knife and spear, against a body of\r\nIndians who possessed the deadly gun.\r\n\r\nAlas! for the sorrows of the poor human race.  In all lands they are\r\nmuch the same, whether civilised or savage--virtue and vice alternately\r\ntriumphing.  Bravery, candour, heroism, in fierce contest with\r\ntreachery, cowardice, and malevolence, form the salient points of the\r\nrecord among all nations, and in all ages.  No puissant knight of old\r\never buckled on his panoply of mail, seized his sword and lance, mounted\r\nhis charger, and sallied forth singlehanded to deliver his mistress from\r\nenchanted castle, in the face of appalling perils, with hotter haste or\r\na more thorough contempt of danger than did our Esquimau giant pursue\r\nthe Indians who had captured his bride; but, like many a daring spirit\r\nof romance, the giant failed, and that through no fault of his.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the rocky platform beside the spring where we first\r\nintroduced him to the reader, the Esquimau sat down, and, casting his\r\nspear on the ground, gazed around him with a look of despair.  It was\r\nnot a slight matter that caused this feeling to arise.  Notwithstanding\r\nhis utmost exertions, he had been unable to overtake the Indians up to\r\nthis point, and beyond this point it was useless to follow them.  The\r\nmountains here were divided into several distinct gorges, each of which\r\nled into the interior of the country; and it was impossible to ascertain\r\nwhich of these had been taken by the Indians, as the bare, rocky land\r\nretained no mark of their light, moccasined feet.  Had the pursuer been\r\nan Indian, the well-known sagacity of the race in following a trail,\r\nhowever slight, might have enabled him to trace the route of the party;\r\nbut the Esquimaux are unpractised in this stealthy, dog-like quality.\r\nTheir habits and the requirements of their condition render it almost\r\nunnecessary; so that, in difficult circumstances, their sagacity in this\r\nrespect is not equal to the emergency.  Add to this the partial\r\nconfusion created in the young giant's brain by his wound, and it will\r\nnot appear strange that despair at length seized him, when, after a\r\nsevere journey, he arrived at a spot where, as it were, half a dozen\r\ncross-roads met, and he had not the most distant idea which he had to\r\nfollow.  It is true the valley of the river seemed the most probable\r\nroute; but after pursuing this for a whole day without coming upon a\r\nvestige of the party, he gave up the pursuit, and, returning to the\r\nspring beside the rock, passed the night there with a heavy heart.  When\r\nthe sun rose on the following morning he quitted his lair, and, taking a\r\nlong draught at the bubbling spring, prepared to depart.  Before setting\r\nout, he cast a melancholy glance around the amphitheatre of gloomy\r\nhills; shook his spear, in the bitterness of his heart, towards the dark\r\nrecesses which had swallowed up the light of his eyes, perchance for\r\never; then, turning slowly towards the north, with drooping head, and\r\nwith the listless tread of a heart-broken man, he retraced his steps to\r\nthe sea-coast, and, rejoining his comrades, was soon far away from the\r\nbanks of the Caniapuscaw River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE VOYAGE--PLANS AND PROSPECTS--EXPLORING PARTIES SENT OUT.\r\n\r\nThree weeks alter the departure of the Esquimaux from the neighbourhood\r\nof Ungava Bay, the echoes of these solitudes were awakened by the merry\r\nsong of the Canadian voyageurs, as the two canoes of Stanley and his\r\ncomrades swept down the stream and approached the spring at the foot of\r\nthe flat rock.\r\n\r\nAs the large canoe ran its bow lightly on the sand, the first man who\r\nleaped ashore was La Roche.  He seemed even more sprightly and active\r\nthan formerly, but was a good deal darker in complexion, and much\r\ntravel-stained.  Indeed, the whole party bore marks of having roughed it\r\npretty severely for some time past among the mountains.  Edith's face\r\nwas decidedly darker than when she left Moose, and her short frock\r\nconsiderably shorter in consequence of tear and wear.\r\n\r\n\"Bad luck to ye, Losh!  Out o' the way, an' let yer betters land before\r\nye,\" exclaimed Bryan, as he jumped into the water, and dragged the canoe\r\ntowards the beach.\r\n\r\nThe only marks that rough travelling had put on Bryan were one or two\r\nadditional wrinkles in his battered white hat; as for his face, it was\r\nalready so thoroughly bronzed by long exposure, that a week or two more\r\nor less made no difference in its hue.\r\n\r\n\"Jump into my arms, Miss Edith,\" said Francois, as he stood in the water\r\nbeside the canoe.\r\n\r\n\"Steady, boy; mind the gum,\" cried Massan, as Oolibuck strained the\r\ncanoe roughly in shouldering a package.\r\n\r\n\"Look out ashore, there,\" cried Dick Prince, throwing the tent poles on\r\nthe beach as he spoke.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the warning, Gaspard did not \"look out,\" and received a\r\nrap on the leg from one of the poles, whereat he growled savagely, and\r\nthrew down a sack, which rested on his shoulder, so violently that it\r\nnearly knocked over Ma-istequan, who was passing at the time with the\r\ncamp-kettle in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"What an ould buffalo it is!\" exclaimed Bryan, pushing Gaspard rudely\r\naside with his left shoulder, and hitching off La Roche's cap with his\r\nright, as he sprang back to the canoe for another load.  \"Pardonay mwa,\r\nLosh, may garson,\" he exclaimed, with a broad grin.  \"Now thin, boys,\r\nout wid the fixin's.  Faix it's mysilf is plazed to git ashore anyhow,\r\nfor there's nothin' gone into my intarior since brickfust this mornin'.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the bow of the other canoe grated on the sand, and Frank\r\nMorton leaped ashore.\r\n\r\n\"Capital place to camp, Frank,\" said Stanley, who had just finished\r\npitching the tent on the scrimp herbage that forced its way through the\r\nsand.  \"There's a splendid spring of pure water below yonder rock.  I've\r\njust left my wife and Eda busy with the tea-cups, and La Roche\r\npreventing them from getting things ready, by way of helping them.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does indeed seem a good place,\" replied Frank, \"and might do for\r\ntemporary headquarters, perhaps, while we make excursions to the coast\r\nto fix on a spot for our new home.\"\r\n\r\nStanley gazed contemplatively around him as his friend spoke.  \"Hand me\r\nthe telescope, Frank; it strikes me we are nearer the sea than you\r\nthink.  The water here is brackish, and yonder opening in the mountains\r\nmight reveal something beyond, if magnified by the glass.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthened survey of the surrounding hills, Frank and Stanley\r\ncame to the conclusion that they could make nothing of it, at least that\r\nnight; and as it was becoming gradually dark, they resolved to postpone\r\nall further consideration of the subject till the next day.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the men busied themselves in preparing supper, and Chimo\r\nunexpectedly lent them some assistance by bringing into camp a ptarmigan\r\nwhich he had just killed.  True, Chimo had, in his innocence, designed\r\nthis little delicacy of the season for his own special table; but no\r\nsooner was he seen with the bird between his teeth, than it was snatched\r\nfrom him and transferred to the pot forthwith.\r\n\r\nThe following day was an era in the existence of the travellers.  For\r\nthe first time since commencing their arduous voyage, the cargoes were\r\nleft behind, and the canoes paddled away, light and buoyant, on a trip\r\nof investigation.  Stanley had rightly judged that they were now near\r\nthe sea, and the great breadth of the river led him to believe that\r\nthere might be water sufficient to float the vessel in which the goods\r\nfor the station were to be forwarded.  If this should turn out as he\r\nexpected, there could not be a better spot for establishing a fort than\r\nthat on which they had encamped, as it was situated just below the last\r\nrapids of the river; had a fine spring of fresh water in its vicinity;\r\nand was protected from the cold blasts of winter, to some extent at\r\nleast, by the surrounding mountains.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Frank,\" added Mr Stanley, after stating his opinion on this\r\npoint, \"what I mean to do is this: I shall take the large canoe, with\r\nDick Prince, Francois, Gaspard, La Roche, and Augustus--the last to\r\ninterpret should we fall in with Esquimaux, whom I am surprised not to\r\nhave found hereabouts.  With these I will proceed to the sea, examine\r\nthe coast, observe whether there be any place suitable for building on,\r\nand, if all goes well, be back to supper before sunset.  You will take\r\nthe other canoe, with Bryan, Massan, Oolibuck, and Ma-istequan, and\r\nproceed down the opposite side of the river a short way.  Examine the\r\nshores there, and above the island; see whether there be any place\r\nbetter than where we stand for a permanent residence; and at night we\r\nshall compare notes.  My wife and Eda shall remain in camp under the\r\ncare of Oostesimow and Moses.\"\r\n\r\n\"And pray who is to defend your poor wife and innocent child in the\r\nevent of an attack by a band of savage natives?\" inquired Mrs Stanley,\r\nas she joined her husband and Frank.\r\n\r\n\"No fear of the wife and child,\" replied Stanley, patting his better\r\nhalf on the shoulder.  \"If Indians should find out the camp, Oostesimow\r\ncan palaver with them; and should Esquimaux pay you a visit, Moses will\r\ndo the polite.  Besides, had you not interrupted, I was going to have\r\ngiven special instructions to Frank regarding you.  So, Master Frank, be\r\npleased to take Eda off your shoulder, and give ear to my instructions.\r\nWhile you are examining the other side of the water, you will keep as\r\nmuch as possible within eye-shot, and always within ear-shot, of the\r\ncamp.  In a still day like this a gun-shot can be heard five or six\r\nmiles off; and should you see any sign of the natives having been here\r\nrecently, return instantly to the camp.\"\r\n\r\nFrank promised implicit obedience to these instructions, and the whole\r\nparty then set to work to pile the goods on a ledge in the steep cliffs\r\nbehind the spring, so that a fortress was soon formed, which, with two\r\nsuch stout and courageous men as Moses and Oostesimow, armed with two\r\nguns each, a brace of pistols, two cutlasses, and an ample supply of\r\nammunition, could have stood a prolonged siege from much more practised\r\nenemies than Indians or Esquimaux.  After having completed these\r\ndefensive arrangements, and provided occupation for those who remained\r\nin camp, by laying on them the duty of having the goods examined, in\r\norder to see that nothing had been damaged by wet or rough usage, the\r\ntwo canoes pushed from the shore, and bounded lightly away, while the\r\nmen sang merrily at their easy labour; for now that the canoes were\r\nlight, they might have been propelled by two men.  Frank directed his\r\ncourse obliquely up the river, towards the island already alluded to,\r\nand Stanley proceeded with the current towards the narrows beyond which\r\nhe expected to catch sight of the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter passing above the island, which was found to be low and thinly\r\ncovered with vegetation and a few scrubby bushes, Frank and his men\r\npushed over to the other side and proceeded carefully to examine the\r\ncoast.  It was found to be much the same as that which they had just\r\nleft.  A narrow belt of sandy and shingly beach extended along the\r\nmargin of the river, or, as it might be more appropriately termed, the\r\nlake, at least in as far as appearance went.  This strip or belt was\r\nindented here and there with numerous bays and inlets, and in many\r\nplaces was intersected by rocky capes which jutted out from the\r\nmountains.  These mountains were bare and precipitous, rising abruptly,\r\nlike those on the other side, from the edge of the sand, and ascending\r\nin a succession of terraces, whose faces were so steep that it was\r\nalmost impossible to scale them.  They could be ascended in succession,\r\nhowever, by means of the ravines and numerous gullies which rose in\r\nrugged and zigzag lines from the beach to the mountain tops.  In the\r\nvery first of these gullies in which the exploring party landed, they\r\nfound the remains of an Esquimau summer encampment.  These consisted of\r\na few stunted trees, which appeared to have been built in the form of\r\nrude huts; but they were thrown about in some confusion, and altogether\r\nbore evidence of having remained in a state of ruin for many years.\r\nAnother discovery of a more satisfactory kind was made--namely, the\r\ntracks of deer, which were so fresh as to induce Frank to take his rifle\r\nand mount the ravine in search of the animals, accompanied by Massan,\r\nwhose natural temperament was exceedingly prone to enjoy the excitement\r\nof the chase.  So much, indeed, was this the case, that the worthy guide\r\nhad more than once been on the point of making up his mind to elope to\r\nthe backwood settlements of the States, purchase a rifle and ammunition\r\nthere, don a deerskin hunting-shirt, and \"make tracks,\" as he styled it,\r\nfor the prairies, there to dwell and hunt until his eye refused to draw\r\nthe sight and his finger to pull the trigger of a Kentucky rifle.  But\r\nMassan's sociable disposition came in the way of this plan, and the\r\nthought of leading a solitary life always induced him to forego it.\r\n\r\n\"It's my 'pinion, sir,\" remarked the guide, as he followed Frank up the\r\nravine, the sheltered parts of which were covered with a few clumps of\r\nstunted pines--\"it's my 'pinion that we'll have to cut our logs a long\r\nbit up the river, for there's nothin' fit to raise a fort with\r\nhereabouts.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, Massan,\" replied Frank, glancing from side to side, hunter\r\nfashion, as he walked swiftly over the broken ground; \"there's not a\r\ntree that I can see big enough to build a backwoods shanty with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, master, 'twill do for firewood, if it's fit for nothin' else, and\r\nthat's a blessin' that's not always to be comed by everywhere.  Let's be\r\nthankful for small matters.  I see sticks growin' up them gullies\r\nthat'll do for stakes for the nets, an' axe handles, an' paddles, an'\r\nspear shafts, an'--\"\r\n\r\nThe honest guide's enumeration of the various articles into which the\r\nsmall timber of the place might be converted was brought to a sudden\r\npause by Frank, who laid his hand on his shoulder, and while he pointed\r\nwith the butt of his rifle up the ravine, whispered, \"Don't you see\r\nanything else up yonder besides trees, Massan?\"\r\n\r\nThe guide looked in the direction indicated, and by an expressive grunt\r\nshowed that his eye had fallen on the object referred to by his\r\ncompanion.  It was a deer which stood on an overhanging ledge of rock,\r\nhigh up the cliffs--so high that it might easily have been mistaken for\r\na much smaller animal by less practised sportsmen.  Below the shelf on\r\nwhich it stood was a yawning abyss, which rendered any attempt to get\r\nnear the animal utterly hopeless.\r\n\r\n\"What a pity,\" said Frank, as he crouched behind a projecting rock,\r\n\"that it's out of shot!  It would take us an hour at least to get behind\r\nit, and there's little chance, I fear, of its waiting for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No chance whatever,\" replied Massan decidedly.  \"But he's big enough to\r\ncover from where we stand.\"\r\n\r\n\"To cover!  Ay, truly, I could point straight at his heart easy enough--\r\nindeed I would think it but slight boasting to say I could cover his eye\r\nfrom this spot--but the bullet would refuse to go, Massan; it's far\r\nbeyond shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try, sir, try,\" exclaimed the guide quickly, for as they spoke the deer\r\nmoved.  \"I've been huntin' on the Rocky Mountains afore now, an' I know\r\nthat distance cheats you in sich places.  It's not so far as you\r\nthink--\"\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely finished speaking when Frank's rifle poured forth its\r\ncontents.  The loud echoes of the crags reverberated as the smoke\r\nfloated away to leeward.  The next instant the deer sprang with one wild\r\nbound high into the air--over the cliff--and descending with lightning\r\nspeed through the dark space, was dashed almost in pieces on the rocks\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nMassan gave a low chuckle of satisfaction as he walked up to the mangled\r\nanimal, and pointing to a small round hole just over its heart, he said,\r\n\"The old spot, Mr Frank; ye always hit them there.\"\r\n\r\nHaving paid Frank this compliment, Massan bled the animal, which was in\r\nprime condition, with at least two inches of fat on its flanks, and\r\nhaving placed it on his shoulders, returned with his companion to the\r\ncanoe.\r\n\r\nWhile Frank was thus engaged, Stanley had descended towards the shores\r\nof Ungava Bay, which he found to be about twenty-five miles distant from\r\nthe encampment beside the spring.  He made a rapid survey of the coast\r\nas they descended, and sounded the river at intervals.  When he reached\r\nits mouth he had made two important discoveries.  The one was, that\r\nthere did not seem to be a spot along the whole line of coast so well\r\nfitted in all respects for an establishment as the place whereon their\r\ntents were already pitched.  The other was, that the river, from its\r\nmouth up to that point, was deep enough to float a vessel of at least\r\nthree or four hundred tons burden.  This was very satisfactory, and he\r\nwas about to return to the camp when he came upon the deserted Esquimau\r\nvillage which, a few weeks before, had been the scene of a murderous\r\nattack and a hasty flight.  On a careful examination of the place, the\r\nmarks of a hasty departure were so apparent that Stanley and his men\r\nmade a pretty near guess at the true state of affairs; and the former\r\nrightly conjectured that, having made a precipitate flight in\r\nconsequence of some unexpected attack, there was little probability of\r\ntheir returning soon to the same locality.  This was unfortunate, but in\r\nthe hope that he might be mistaken in these conjectures, and that the\r\nnatives might yet return before winter, he set up a pole on a\r\nconspicuous place, and tied to the top of it a bag containing two dozen\r\nknives, one dozen fire-steels, some awls and needles, several pounds of\r\nbeads, and a variety of such trinkets as were most likely to prove\r\nacceptable to a savage people.\r\n\r\nWhile Bryan was engaged in piling a heap of stones at the foot of this\r\npole to prevent its being blown down by the wind, the rest of the party\r\nre-embarked, and prepared to return home; for although the camp beside\r\nthe spring was scarcely one day old, the fact that it was likely to\r\nbecome the future residence of the little party had already invested it\r\nwith a species of homelike attraction.  Man is a strange animal, and\r\nwhatever untravelled philosophers may say to the contrary, he speedily\r\nmakes himself \"at home\" _anywhere_!\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, Bryan!\" shouted Stanley from the canoe, \"look sharp; we're\r\nwaiting for you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, yer honour,\" replied the Irishman, lifting a huge mass of rock;\r\n\"jist wan more, an' it'll be stiff an' stidy as the north pole himself.\"\r\nThen in an undertone he added, \"`Look sharp,' is it ye say?  It's blunt\r\nye are to spake that way to yer betters.  Musha! but it's mysilf\r\nwouldn't give a tinpinny for all that bag houlds, twinty times doubled;\r\nan' yit thim haythens, thim pork-faced Huskimos, 'll dance round this\r\nhere pole wi' delight till they're fit to dhrop.  Och! but salvages is a\r\nquare lot; an', Bryan, yer a cliver boy to come this far all the way to\r\nsee thim.\"\r\n\r\nWith this self-complimentary conclusion, Bryan resumed his place at the\r\npaddle, and the party returned to the camp.\r\n\r\nHere they found things in a most satisfactory state.  Frank and his\r\nparty had returned, and the deer, now cut up into joints and steaks, was\r\nimpaled on a number of stakes of wood, and stuck up to roast round a\r\nlarge and cheering fire.  The savoury steam from these, with the\r\nrefreshing odour of the tea-kettle, produced a delectable sensation in\r\nthe nostrils of the hungry explorers.  Stanley's tent was erected with\r\nits back towards the mountains and its open door towards the fire, which\r\nlighted up its snug interior, and revealed Mrs Stanley and Edith\r\nimmersed in culinary operations, and Chimo watching them with a look of\r\ndeep, grave sagacity--his ears very erect, and his head a good deal\r\ninclined to one side, as if that position favoured the peculiar train of\r\nhis cogitations.  La Roche was performing feats of agility round the\r\nfire, that led one to believe he must be at least half a salamander.  At\r\na respectful distance from Stanley's tent, but within the influence of\r\nthe fire, the men were employed in pitching, for the first time, the\r\nlarge skin tent which was to be their residence until they should build\r\na house for themselves; and on a log, within dangerous proximity to the\r\nmercurial La Roche, sat Frank Morton, busily employed in entering in his\r\njournal the various events of the day.\r\n\r\nThere was much talk and loud laughter round the fire that night, for the\r\ndifferent parties had much to tell and much to hear regarding the\r\ndiscoveries that had been made, and discussions as to the prospects of\r\nthe expedition were earnest and long.  It was generally admitted that\r\nfirst appearances were, upon the whole, favourable, although it could\r\nnot be denied that the place looked dreadfully barren and rugged.  Under\r\nthe happy influence of this impression, and the happier influence of the\r\nsavoury steaks on which they had supped, the entire party lay down to\r\nrest, and slept so profoundly that there was neither sound nor motion to\r\nindicate the presence of human beings in the vast solitudes of Ungava,\r\nsave the fitful flame of the fire as it rose and fell, casting a lurid\r\nlight on the base of the rugged mountains, and a sharp reflection on the\r\ndark waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY BEGIN TO DEVELOP--BRYAN DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF--\r\nFISHING EXTRAORDINARY.\r\n\r\nThere is a calm but deep-seated and powerful pleasure which fills the\r\nheart, and seems to permeate the entire being, when one awakens to the\r\nconviction that a day of arduous toil is about to begin--toil of an\r\nuncertain kind, perhaps connected with danger and adventure, in an\r\nunexplored region of the earth.  Ignorance always paints coming events\r\nin glowing colours; and the mere fact that our adventurers knew not the\r\nnature of the country in which their tent was pitched--knew not whether\r\nthe natives would receive them as friends or repel them as foes--knew\r\nnot whether the nature and capabilities of the country were such as\r\nwould be likely to convert the spot on which they lay into a comfortable\r\nhome or a premature grave;--the mere fact of being utterly ignorant on\r\nthese points was, in itself, sufficient to fill the poorest spirit of\r\nthe band (had there been a poor spirit among them) with a glow of\r\npleasurable excitement, and a firm resolve to tax their powers of doing\r\nand suffering to the uttermost.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun rose on the following morning the whole party was astir,\r\nthe fire lighted, and an early breakfast in course of preparation.  Much\r\nhad to be done, and it behoved them to set about it with energy and at\r\nonce, for the short autumn of these arctic regions was drawing on apace,\r\nand a winter of great length and of the utmost severity lay before them.\r\n\r\nThere was also one consideration which caused some anxiety to Stanley\r\nand Frank, although it weighed little on the reckless spirits of the\r\nmen, and this was the possibility of the non-arrival of the ship with\r\ntheir winter supply of provisions and goods for trade.  Without such a\r\nsupply a winter on the shores of Ungava Bay would involve all the\r\nhardships and extreme perils that too often fall to the lot of arctic\r\ndiscoverers; and he who has perused the fascinating journals of those\r\ngallant men, knows that these hardships and perils are neither few nor\r\nlight.  The leaders of the expedition were not, indeed, men to\r\nanticipate evils, or to feel unduly anxious about possible dangers; but\r\nthey would have been more or less than human had they been able to look\r\nat Mrs Stanley and little Edith without a feeling of anxiety on their\r\naccount.  This thought, however, did not influence them in their\r\nactions; or, if it did, it only spurred them on to more prompt and\r\nvigorous exertions in the carrying out of their undertaking.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Stanley assembled his men, and gave each special\r\ndirections what to do.  One of the most important points to ascertain\r\nwas whether there were many fish in the river.  On this hung much of the\r\nfuture comfort and well-being, perhaps even the existence, of the party.\r\nGaspard was, therefore, ordered to get out his nets and set them\r\nopposite the encampment.  Oolibuck, being officially an interpreter of\r\nthe Esquimau language, and, when not employed in his calling, regarded\r\nas a sort of male maid-of-all-work, was ordered to assist Gaspard.  The\r\nnext matter of primary importance was to ascertain what animals\r\ninhabited the region, and whether they were numerous.  Dick Prince,\r\nbeing the recognised hunter of the party, was directed to take his gun\r\nand a large supply of ammunition, and sally forth over the mountains in\r\nsearch of game; and as Massan was a special friend of his, a good shot,\r\nand, moreover, a sagacious fellow, he was ordered to accompany him.\r\nThey were also directed to observe particularly the state of the woods\r\nand the quality of the timber growing therein; but as this last required\r\nspecial attention, the style and size of the future fort being dependent\r\non it, Francois, the carpenter, was appointed to make a journey of\r\nobservation up the Caniapuscaw River, in company with Augustus the\r\nEsquimau and Ma-istequan the Indian--it being thought probable that if\r\nnatives were to be met with at all, they would be on the banks of the\r\nriver rather than in the mountains.  It was further arranged that Frank\r\nMorton should ascend the mountains in company with Bryan, and ascertain\r\nif there were any lakes, and whether or not they contained fish.  As for\r\nMr Stanley, he resolved to remain by the camp.  On entering his tent\r\nafter dispatching the several parties, he said to his wife--\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to stay by you to-day, Jessie.  All the men, except Moses,\r\nOostesimow, Gaspard, and La Roche, are sent off to hunt and fish in the\r\nmountains, and I have kept these four to paddle about this\r\nneighbourhood, in order to take soundings and examine the coast more\r\ncarefully; because, you see, it would be an unfortunate thing if we\r\nbegan our establishment in a place not well suited for it.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Stanley and Edith were, of course, quite pleased with this\r\narrangement, and while the males of the party were absent, the former\r\nemployed herself in dressing the skin of the deer that had been shot the\r\nday before.  She accomplished this after the Indian fashion, by scraping\r\nand rubbing it with the animal's brains.  Afterwards she smoked it over\r\na fire of green wood, and in this way produced a soft, pliant substance\r\nsimilar to chamois leather, but coarser and stouter.  As for Edith, she\r\nrambled at will among the bushes of the nearest ravine, under the\r\nfaithful guardianship of Chimo, and hurried back to the camp almost\r\nevery hour, laden with cloudberries, cranberries, blaeberries, and\r\ncrowberries, which grew in profusion everywhere.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the camp the water was found to be eight fathoms deep.  This\r\nwas of great importance, as affording facility for unloading the ship\r\nabreast of the establishment.  Higher up the river the ground was more\r\nfavourable for building, both on account of its being more sheltered and\r\nbetter wooded with timber fit for the construction of houses; but the\r\nwater was too shallow to float the ship, and the island before\r\nmentioned, which was named Cross Island, proved an effectual barrier to\r\nthe upward progress of any craft larger than a boat.  But as Stanley\r\nsurveyed the spot on which the tent was pitched, and observed the\r\nsheltering background of mountains, with their succession of terraces;\r\nthe creek or ravine to the right, with its growth of willows and stunted\r\npines; the level parcel of greensward, with the little fountain under\r\nthe rock; and the fine sandy bay in which Gaspard and Oolibuck were\r\nbusily engaged in setting a couple of nets,--when he surveyed all this,\r\nhe felt that, although not the best locality in the neighbourhood, it\r\nwas, nevertheless, a very good one, and well suited in many respects for\r\nthe future establishment.\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, the net him set,\" shouted Oolibuck from the shore to his\r\nmaster, who floated in the bay at the distance of a hundred yards,\r\nbusily engaged with the sounding-line.  On receiving this piece of\r\ninformation, Stanley ran the canoe on the beach, and said to his\r\nfollower--\r\n\r\n\"Oolibuck, I have been thinking much about that river which we saw\r\nyesterday, off the mouth of this one; and I cannot help fearing that the\r\nship will run into it, instead of into this, for the land is very\r\ndeceptive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me t'ink dat is true,\" answered the Esquimau, with a look of grave\r\nperplexity.  \"If de ship go into dat riv'r he t'ink we no arrive, and so\r\nhe go 'way, and we all starve!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Oolibuck, I trust that such would not be the sad result of the\r\nship failing to find us; but in order to prevent this, if possible, I\r\nintend to send you down to the coast, with a few days' provisions, to\r\nkeep a look-out for the ship, and light a fire if you see her, so that\r\nshe may be guided to the right place.  So get a blanket and your gun as\r\nfast as you can, and be off.  I can only afford you four days'\r\nprovisions, Oolibuck, so you will have to prove yourself a good hunter,\r\nelse you'll starve.  Will four days' provisions do?\"\r\n\r\nOolibuck's eyes disappeared.  We do not mean to say that they flew away,\r\nor were annihilated.  But Oolibuck was fat--so fat that, when he\r\nlaughed, his eyes reduced themselves into two little lines surrounded by\r\nwrinkles; a result which was caused by a physical incapacity to open the\r\nmouth and eyes at the same time.  As a general rule, when Oolibuck's\r\nmouth was open his eyes were shut, and when his eyes were open his mouth\r\nwas shut.  Being a good-humoured fellow, and of a risible nature, the\r\nalternations were frequent.  It was the idea of Stanley doubting the\r\nsufficiency of four days' provisions that closed the eyes of the\r\nEsquimau on the present occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Two days' grub more dan 'nuff,\" said Oolibuck.  \"Give me plenty powder\r\nand shot, and me no starve--no fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" rejoined Stanley, laughing, \"take as much ammunition as you\r\nrequire, but be careful of it; if the ship fails us we shall need it\r\nall.  And don't be too eager after the deer, Oolibuck; keep a sharp\r\nlook-out seaward, be on the hill-tops as much as you can, and keep your\r\neyes open.\"\r\n\r\nOolibuck replied by closing the said eyes with a smile, as he hurried\r\ntowards the tent to prepare for his expedition.  In the meantime Stanley\r\ndirected Oostesimow and La Roche to set about building a small canoe out\r\nof the birch bark which they had carried with them for the purpose, the\r\nlarge canoes being too cumbrous for the purpose of overhauling the nets.\r\n\r\nThe nets had been set by Gaspard in the usual way--that is, with stones\r\nattached to the lower lines to act as sinkers, and floats attached to\r\nthe upper lines to keep them spread; and it was with no little\r\nimpatience that the party in the camp awaited the issue.  Indeed they\r\nscarcely permitted an hour to pass without an inspection being ordered;\r\nbut to their chagrin, instead of finding fish, they found the nets\r\nrolled up by the conflicting currents of the river and the tide into the\r\nform of two ropes.\r\n\r\n\"This will never do,\" cried Stanley, as they brought the nets ashore.\r\n\"We must set stake-nets immediately.  It is nearly low tide now, so if\r\nwe work hard they may be ready to set up before the tide has risen\r\nmuch.\"\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this plan, Stanley and his men went to the ravine, of\r\nwhich mention has been already made, and proceeded to cut stakes for the\r\nnets; while Oolibuck, having explained to Mrs Stanley and Edith that he\r\nwas \"going to look _h_out for de ship,\" shouldered his wallet and gun,\r\nand ascending the ravine, speedily gained the first terrace of the\r\nmountains, along which he hastened in the direction of the sea-coast.\r\n\r\nWhile the party in the camp were thus engaged, Frank Morton and Bryan\r\ninstituted a thorough investigation of the country that lay directly in\r\nthe rear of the camp, in the course of which investigation they made\r\nsundry interesting discoveries.\r\n\r\nAfter ascending the ravine in which we left Stanley and his men cutting\r\nstakes for the nets, Frank and Bryan reached the first terrace, and\r\nproceeded along it in the opposite direction from that pursued by\r\nOolibuck.  A walk of a quarter of a mile, or less, brought them to\r\nanother ravine, into which they turned, and the first thing that greeted\r\nthem as they pushed their way through the stunted willows that thickly\r\ncovered this gorge in the mountains was a covey of ptarmigan.  These\r\nbirds are similar in form and size to ordinary grouse, perhaps a little\r\nsmaller.  In winter they are pure white--so white that it is difficult\r\nto detect them amid the snow; but in summer their coats become brown,\r\nthough there are a few of the pure white feathers left which never\r\nchange their colour.  Being unaccustomed to the sight of man, they stood\r\ngazing at Frank and Bryan in mute surprise, until the latter hastily\r\nthrew forward his gun, when they wisely took to flight.  But Frank\r\narrested his follower's arm.\r\n\r\n\"Don't waste your powder and shot, Bryan, on such small game.  There may\r\nbe something more worthy of a shot among the mountains; and if you once\r\nraise the echoes among these wild cliffs, I fear the game will not wait\r\nto inquire the cause thereof.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe not, sir,\" replied Bryan, as he fell back a pace, and permitted\r\nFrank to lead the way; \"but there's an ould proverb that says, `A bird\r\nin the hand's worth two in the buss,' an' I've great belaif in that\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true, Bryan, there is much wisdom in old proverbs; but there are\r\nexceptions to every rule, and this is a case in point, as you will admit\r\nif you cast your eyes over yonder valley, and observe the edge of the\r\nmountain-top that cuts so clear a line against the sky.\"\r\n\r\nFrank pointed, as he spoke, to the shoulder or spur of one of the\r\nmountains which rose at a considerable distance in the interior, and\r\nfrom which they were separated by a dark glen or gorge; for none of the\r\nravines in this part of the country merited the name of valley, save\r\nthat through which flowed the Caniapuscaw River.  The ravine up which\r\nthey had been toiling for some time led into this darksome glen, and it\r\nwas on rounding a bold precipice, which had hitherto concealed it from\r\nview, that Frank's quick eye caught sight of the object to which he\r\ndirected the attention of his companion.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a crow,\" said Bryan, after a gaze of five minutes, during which he\r\nhad gone through a variety of strange contortions--screwing up his\r\nfeatures, shading his eyes with his hand, standing on tip-toe, although\r\nthere was nothing to look over, and stooping low, with a hand on each\r\nknee, though there was nothing to look under, in the vain hope to\r\nincrease by these means his power of vision.\r\n\r\nFrank regarded him with a quiet smile, as he said, \"Look again, Bryan.\r\nSaw you ever a crow with antlers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anthlers!\" exclaimed the Irishman, once more wrinkling up his\r\nexpressive face, and peering under his palm; \"anthlers, say you?  Sorra\r\na thing duv I see 'xcept a black spot on the sky.  If ye see anthlers on\r\nit, ye're nothin' more nor less than a walkin' spy-glass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless I see them, Bryan; and they grace the head of a noble\r\nbuck.  Now, you see, it is well you did not fire at the ptarmigan.  Away\r\nwith you, lad, down into that ravine, and clamber up the mountain\r\nthrough yonder gap with the fallen rock in the middle of it--d'ye see?--\r\nand wait there, lest the deer should turn back.  In the meantime I'll\r\nrun round by the way we came, and descend to the water's edge, to\r\nreceive him when he arrives there.  Now don't lose yourself, and take\r\ncare not to fire at smaller game.\"\r\n\r\nAs Frank concluded these orders, which he issued in a quick low voice,\r\nhe threw his gun into the hollow of his left arm and strode rapidly\r\naway, leaving his companion gazing after him with an expression of blank\r\nstupidity on his face.  Gradually his cheeks and brow were overspread\r\nwith a thousand wrinkles and a smile took possession of his lips.\r\n\r\n\"`Don't lose yersilf!'  Faix, Master Frank, ye're free an' aisy.  Arrah\r\nnow, Bryan dear, don't lose yersilf; you that's crossed the salt saes,\r\nan' followed the Red Injins to the prairie, and hunted in the Rocky\r\nMountains, and found yer way to Ungava--not to mintion havin' comed\r\noraginally from ould Ireland--which ov itsilf secures ye agin mistakes\r\nof every kind whatsumdiver.  Lose yersilf!  Musha, but ye had better git\r\nsome wan to look after ye, Bryan boy.  Take care now; go softly and kape\r\nyer eyes open, for fear ye lose yersilf!\"\r\n\r\nAs Bryan mumbled forth this bantering soliloquy, he lifted up a large\r\nbag which contained a couple of fishing-lines and a few hooks, and\r\nthrowing it across the stock of his gun, and both across his shoulder,\r\nhe took his way down the rugged but well-beaten deer-path which led to\r\nthe ravine or glen.  The idea of losing himself seemed to have taken\r\nsuch a hold of Bryan's mind, and afforded him so much amusement and such\r\nscope for the continued flow of bantering soliloquy to which he was in\r\ntruth much addicted, that he failed to note the fact that he was walking\r\nalong the edge of a steep declivity, at the foot of which lay a small,\r\ndark sheet of water, which was connected by a short river or strait with\r\na larger lake, whose wavelets rippled at the base of the mountain\r\nbeyond.  The scene was magnificently wild and lonely, and would have\r\nriveted the attention and excited the admiration of any one less absent\r\nthan Bryan.  High, rugged, and to all appearance inaccessible mountains\r\nsurrounded the vale on all sides; and although there were several\r\noutlets from it, these were so concealed by the peculiar formation of\r\nthe wild mountains that they could not be seen until they were actually\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nHad Bryan's eyes been more active, he would have seen that the fringe of\r\nbushes by the side of the deer-track, along which he walked, concealed a\r\ndeclivity so steep that it almost merited the name of a precipice.  But\r\nBryan was lost in philosophic contemplation, and the first thing that\r\nawakened him to the fact was the slipping of a stone, which caused him\r\nto trip and fall headlong over the bank!  The Irishman grasped\r\nconvulsively at the bushes to arrest his fall, but the impetus with\r\nwhich he had commenced the descent tore them from his grasp, and after\r\none or two unpleasant bounds and a good deal of crashing through shrubs\r\nthat tore his garments sadly, he found himself stretched at full length\r\non the margin of the river that connected the two lakes.  So nearly had\r\nhe been hurled into this strait by the violence of his descent that his\r\nhead was hanging over the bank ere he stopped!  Being partially stunned\r\nby the fall, Bryan lay for a few seconds motionless.  As his shaken\r\nfaculties returned, however, he became aware of the fact that a fish of\r\nfully two feet long lay at the bottom of the pool over which his head\r\nhung.  Starting up, and totally forgetting his bruises, he turned to\r\nlook for the bag containing the fishing-lines, and observing it lying on\r\nthe ground not far distant, still wrapped round the gun, he ran to pick\r\nit up.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! wow! poor thing!\" he exclaimed, on lifting up his gun, which,\r\nthough fortunately not broken, was sadly bent, \"ye're fit for nothin'\r\nbut shootin' round the corner now!  It's well for you, Bryan, ye\r\nspalpeen, that your backbone is not in the same fix.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he thus muttered to himself, Bryan drew from the bag a stout\r\ncod-line, to which he fastened a hook of deadly dimensions, and dressed\r\nit into the form of a fly, much in the same manner as was formerly done\r\nby La Roche.  This line and fly he fastened to the end of a short stout\r\npole which he cut from a neighbouring tree, and approaching cautiously\r\nto the bank of the strait--for there was too little motion in it to\r\nentitle it to be called a stream--he cast the fly with a violent splash\r\ninto the water.  The violence was unintentional--at least the\r\nexclamations of reproach that followed the cast would lead us to suppose\r\nso.  The fish here were as tame as those caught in Deer River.  In a few\r\nseconds the fly was swallowed, and Bryan, applying main force to the\r\npole, tossed a beautiful trout of about two pounds weight over his head.\r\n\r\n\"Och! ye purty crature,\" exclaimed the delighted Irishman, rubbing his\r\nhands with glee as he gazed at the fish after having unhooked it.\r\n\"Shure ye'll make a beautiful fagure in the kittle this night.  An'\r\nmusha! there's wan o' yer relations to kape ye company,\" he added, as,\r\nexerting an enormous degree of unnecessary force, he drew another trout\r\nviolently from the water.  The second trout was larger than the first,\r\nand Bryan soon became so excited in the sport that he totally forgot\r\nFrank's orders, and the deer, and everything else in the world, for the\r\ntime being.  Having caught six or seven trout, varying from two to four\r\npounds in weight, he changed his position a little, and made a cast over\r\na deep pool nearer to the large lake.  As heretofore, the fly was\r\nengulfed the instant it fell on the water; but Bryan did not, as\r\nheretofore, haul the fish violently out of its native element.  It is\r\ntrue he attempted to do so, but the attempt proved utterly futile;\r\nmoreover, the fish darted with such velocity and strength towards the\r\nlake, that the angler, albeit entirely ignorant of his art, experienced\r\nan inward conviction that the thick cord would snap altogether if not\r\neased of the enormous strain.  He therefore followed the fish at the top\r\nof his speed, uttering incomprehensible sounds of mingled rage and\r\namazement as he went, and tripping over rocks and bushes in his headlong\r\ncareer.  After a smart run of half a minute the fish stopped, turned,\r\nand darted back so rapidly that Bryan tripped in turning and fell into\r\nthe water!  The place was shallow, but having fallen on his back, he was\r\nthoroughly drenched from head to foot.  He did not lose the grasp of his\r\nrod, however.  Spluttering, and gasping, and dripping, he followed the\r\nfish in its wild career until it turned again at a tangent, and darted\r\ntowards the bank on which he stood.  There was a shelving bed of\r\npebbles, where the water shoaled very gradually.  Bryan saw this.\r\nAvailing himself of the fish's impetus, and putting all his force to the\r\nrod, he dragged it into two inches of water, when the line broke.\r\nInstantly the fish struggled towards deep water; but it was so large,\r\nand the place to which it had been dragged so shallow, that it afforded\r\nthe excited angler time to rush forward and throw himself bodily on the\r\ntop of it!\r\n\r\nThe battle that now ensued was of an energetic and deadly character on\r\nthe part of both man and fish.  Those who have not grasped a live salmon\r\nin their arms have no conception of the strength of a fish; and perhaps\r\nit may be said with equal truth that those who have never wielded a\r\nforehammer have but a faint conception of the strength of a blacksmith's\r\nknuckles.  Bryan had thrown his whole weight on the fish, and grasped\r\nit, as with a vice, in both hands; but at every struggle of its powerful\r\nframe he felt how uncertain was the hold he had of its slippery body.\r\nOnce it almost escaped, and dashed the spray over its adversary's face\r\nwith its tail, as it wriggled out of his grasp; but with a desperate\r\nplunge Bryan seized it by the head and succeeded in thrusting his thumb\r\nunder its gill and choking it, while himself was well-nigh choked at the\r\nsame moment by unintentionally swallowing a gulp of the muddy compound\r\nwhich they had stirred up in their struggles.  Slowly and with caution\r\nBryan rose on one knee, while he crushed the fish against the bottom\r\nwith both hands; then making a last exertion, he hurled it up the bank,\r\nwhere it fell beyond all hope of return to its native element.\r\n\r\nThe fish thus captured was a beautiful trout of about twenty pounds\r\nweight.  The lake trout of North America are, some of them, of enormous\r\nsize, being not unfrequently taken of sixty pounds weight, so that as a\r\nspecimen of those inhabiting these lakes this was by no means a large\r\none.  Nevertheless it was a splendid fish, and certainly the largest\r\nthat had ever been captured by the worthy son of Vulcan.\r\n\r\nThe thick coat of liquid mud with which his face was covered could not\r\nentirely conceal the smile of intense satisfaction with which he\r\nregarded his prize, as he sat down on the bank before it.\r\n\r\n\"Kape quiet now, honey!\" he exclaimed, as the trout made a last\r\nfluttering attempt to escape; \"kape quiet.  Have patience, darlint.\r\nIt's o' no manner o' use to hurry natur'.  Just lie still, an' it'll be\r\nsoon over.\"\r\n\r\nWith this consolatory remark, Bryan patted the fish on the head, and\r\nproceeded to wring the water from his upper garments, after which he\r\nrepaired his broken tackle, and resumed his sport with an eagerness and\r\nzest that cold and water and mud could not diminish in the smallest\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nSUCCESSES AND ENCOURAGEMENT--BRYAN LOST AND FOUND.\r\n\r\nIt was evening before the tide began to fall and uncover the stake-nets,\r\nwhich were eagerly and earnestly watched by those who had remained in\r\nthe camp.  Mrs Stanley and Edith were seated on an empty box by the\r\nmargin of the sandy bay; Mr Stanley sat on a nail-keg beside them; La\r\nRoche and the Indian were still working at the small canoe a few yards\r\nfrom the tent; and Gaspard, with folded arms, and an unusual smile of\r\ngood humour playing on his countenance, stood close behind Stanley.\r\n\r\nNone of the hunting and exploring parties had returned, although the sun\r\nhad long since disappeared behind the mountains, and the mellow light of\r\nevening was deepening over the bay.\r\n\r\n\"There's a tail, sir,\" said Gaspard, as he hurried towards the net.\r\n\r\n\"So it is!\" cried Stanley, leaping up.  \"Come along, Eda, and take the\r\nfirst fish.\"\r\n\r\nEdith needed no second invitation, but bounded towards the edge of the\r\nwater, which was now gradually leaving the nets.  Gaspard had already\r\ndisengaged a white fish from the mesh, and wading to the beach, gave it\r\nto the little girl, who ran with it joyously to her mother.  Meanwhile,\r\nanother and another fish was left by the tide, and Stanley soon after\r\nbrought up a splendid salmon of about twenty-five pounds weight, and\r\nlaid it at Edith's feet.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how very beautiful!\" cried the child, as she gazed in delight at\r\nthe silvery scales of the fish.\r\n\r\n\"My mind is much relieved by this, Jessie,\" said Stanley, reseating\r\nhimself on the keg, while Oostesimow and La Roche carried the fish\r\nashore as Gaspard freed them from the nets.  \"I now see that there are\r\nplenty of fish in the river, and if the hunters bring in a good report\r\nto-night, our anxiety on the score of food will be quite removed.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough none of the party had ever set a net on stakes before, they had\r\nfrequently heard of this manner of fishing, and their first attempt\r\nproved eminently successful.  At low tide stakes had been driven into\r\nthe sand, extending from the edge of the water towards high-water mark.\r\nOn these the nets had been spread, and thus the misfortune which had\r\nattended the setting of the nets with floats and sinkers was avoided.\r\nThe quantity of fish taken gave promise of an ample supply for the\r\nfuture.  There were two Hearne-salmon (that is, spotted like trout), and\r\none large common salmon, besides thirty white-fish, averaging between\r\ntwo to six pounds weight each, all of which were in excellent condition.\r\nThe white-fish is of the salmon species, but white in the flesh, and\r\nbeing less rich than the salmon, is much preferred by those who have to\r\nuse it constantly as an article of food.\r\n\r\n\"This is a most fortunate supply,\" remarked Stanley, \"and will prevent\r\nthe necessity of putting the men on short allowance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Short allowance!\" exclaimed his wife; \"I thought we had more than\r\nenough of food to last us till the arrival of the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, so we have.  But until now I did not feel at liberty to use it; for\r\nif through any accident the ship does not come, and if there had chanced\r\nto be no fish in the river, the only course open to us would be to\r\nretrace our steps, and as that would be a long and slow process, we\r\nwould require to economise our food.  In fact, I had resolved to begin\r\noperations by putting the men on short allowance; but this haul of fish\r\nshows me that we shall have more than enough.\r\n\r\n\"But who comes here?\" he added, on observing the figure of a man\r\napproaching the camp.  \"He seems to carry a burden on his back, as far\r\nas I can make out in the uncertain light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did any of the men go out alone?\" inquired Mrs Stanley.\r\n\r\n\"No; but I suppose that this one must have separated from his comrade.--\r\nHallo! who goes there?\"\r\n\r\nThe man tossed the bundle from his shoulders, and hastening forward\r\nrevealed the flushed countenance of Frank Morton.\r\n\r\n\"What!  Frank! why, man, you seem to have had a hard day of it, if I may\r\njudge by your looks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so hard but that a good supper will put its effects to flight,\"\r\nreplied Frank, as he rested his gun against a rock and seated himself on\r\nthe keg from which Stanley had risen.  \"The fact is, I have slain a\r\nnoble buck, and being desirous that the men should have as much of it as\r\npossible, I loaded myself rather heavily.  The ground, too, is horribly\r\nbad; but pray send Gaspard for the bundle.  I should have been here\r\nsooner but for the time required to dissect the animal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Bryan, Frank?\" inquired Mrs Stanley.  \"You went away\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bryan!  I know not.  He and I parted in the mountains some hours ago;\r\nand as he failed to keep his appointment with me, I concluded that he\r\nmust have become foot-sore and returned to camp.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has not returned,\" said Stanley; \"but I have no fear for the honest\r\nblacksmith.  He's too old a nor'wester to lose himself, and he's too\r\ntough to kill.  But come, Frank, let us to our tent.  I see that La\r\nRoche has already prepared our salmon for the kettle, and so--\"\r\n\r\n\"Salmon!\" interrupted Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, lad, salmon! a twenty-five pounder too!  But come, change your\r\nfoot-gear, and then we shall have our supper, in the course of which we\r\nshall exchange news.\"\r\n\r\nAs they proceeded towards the camp the voices of some of the men were\r\nheard in the distance; it was now too dark to see them.  In a few\r\nminutes Francois, followed by Augustus and Ma-istequan, strode into the\r\ncircle of light around the fire, and laying aside their guns proceeded\r\nto light their pipes, while they replied to the questions of Frank and\r\nStanley.\r\n\r\n\"You do not come empty-handed,\" remarked the latter, as Francois and his\r\ncomrades threw down several fat ducks and a few grouse, which, after the\r\nfashion of hunters, they had carried pendent by the necks from their\r\nbelts.\r\n\r\n\"We only shot a few, monsieur,\" replied Francois, \"to put in the kettle\r\nfor supper.  We might have loaded a canoe had we chosen.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is well,\" said Stanley; \"but the kettle is full already, and\r\nsupper prepared.  See, Frank has shot a deer, so that we shall fare well\r\nto-night.--Ah, Prince! come along.  What! more game?\" he added, as Dick\r\nand Massan entered the halo of light, and threw down the choice morsels\r\nof a fat deer which they had killed among the mountains.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! oui, monsieur,\" said Massan, chuckling as he laid aside his axe and\r\ngun; \"we might ha' killed three o' them if we had been so minded; but we\r\ncouldn't ha' brought them into camp, an', as Dick said, 'tis a pity to\r\nkill deer to feed the wolves with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" exclaimed Frank; \"but did any of you see Bryan?  He gave me the\r\nslip in the mountains, and, I fear, has lost himself.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the men replied in the negative, and some of them smiled at the\r\nidea of the blacksmith being lost.\r\n\r\n\"No fear, vraiment!  He no lost,\" cried La Roche with a laugh, as he\r\nlifted the huge kettle from the fire and placed it in the midst of the\r\nmen, having previously abstracted the best portions for the special\r\nbenefit of his master.  \"No fear of Bryan, certainment; he like one bad\r\nshilling--he come up toujours.  Ah! mauvais chien, him give me all de\r\ntrouble ov get supper ready mylone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust it may be so,\" said Stanley.  \"We are all here except him and\r\nOolibuck, whom I have sent to the coast for a few days to watch for the\r\nship.  But let us have supper, La Roche, and spread ours nearer the fire\r\nto-night--it is rather cold; besides, I want to hear the reports of the\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this order, the lively Frenchman spread the supper\r\nfor his master's family close beside that of the men, and in a few\r\nminutes more a most vigorous attack was made on the viands, during the\r\nfirst part of which the hungry travellers maintained unbroken silence.\r\nBut as the cravings of nature began to be satisfied, their tongues found\r\ntime to remark on the excellence of the fare.  The salmon was superb.\r\nEven Edith, who seldom talked about what she ate, pronounced it very\r\ngood.  The white-fish were better than any of the party had ever eaten\r\nin their lives, although most of them had travelled over the length and\r\nbreadth of the North American wilderness.  The ducks were perfect.  Even\r\nthe ptarmigan were declared passable; and the venison, with an inch of\r\nfat on the haunches--words were not found sufficiently expressive to\r\ndescribe it.  Those who are philosophically inclined may suspect that\r\nsome of this super-excellence lay in the keen appetites of the men.\r\nWell, perhaps it did.\r\n\r\nWhile the travellers were in the midst of this, and ere yet their\r\ntongues were fairly loosened, a loud unearthly shout rang with appalling\r\nreverberations among the surrounding cliffs, causing the entire party to\r\nstart up and rush for their arms.  Again the cry was heard.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! bad skran to ye, Losh!--Hould on, Moses, ye fat villain.  Lave me\r\nwan mouthful, jist wan, to kape me from givin' up the ghost intirely.\"\r\n\r\nA shout of laughter greeted the advent of Bryan's voice, but it was\r\nnothing to the peals that burst forth on the appearance of that\r\nindividual in _propria persona_.  To say that he was totally dishevelled\r\nwould convey but half the truth.  Besides being covered and clotted with\r\nmud, he was saturated with water from head to foot, his clothes rent in\r\na most distressing manner, and his features quite undistinguishable.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Bryan, what ails you?  Where have you been?\" inquired Stanley, in\r\na tone of sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"Bin, is it?  Sorra wan o' me knows where I've bin.  It's mysilf is glad\r\nto be sartin I'm here, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you're certain of it,\" said Frank, \"for if it were not for the\r\nsound of your voice, I should doubt it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah monsieur,\" said La Roche, \"make your mind easy on dat.  No von but\r\nBryan ever regard de kettle dat way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Taizy voo, ye petit varmint,\" said Bryan, approaching the said kettle,\r\nand smiling rapturously through the mud that encrusted his face on\r\nbeholding its contents.  Without waiting to change his garments the\r\nhungry blacksmith began supper, having first, however, directed\r\nattention to the bag which he had brought in.  From this bag La Roche\r\nnow extracted about a dozen trout, some of which were of great size--\r\nespecially one, whose bulk exceeded that of the large salmon.\r\n\r\n\"There's plinty more where thim comed from,\" said Bryan, through a\r\nmouthful of venison; \"but I'll tell ye ov it afther supper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, true! don't let us interrupt him just now,\" said Stanley.  \"In the\r\nmeantime, Francois, since you seem to be about done, tell us what you\r\nhave seen, and let us hear what you have to say of the country.\"\r\n\r\nFrancois having lighted his pipe, cleared his throat and began:--\r\n\r\n\"Well, monsieur, after we had paddled a short bit beyond the point below\r\nthe last rapid in Caniapuscaw River, we shoved the canoe ashore, and\r\nlanded Prince and Massan, who set off to look for game, leavin'\r\nAugustus, Ma-istequan, and me to paddle up the river as well as we\r\ncould.  But we soon found that three men in a big canoe could not make\r\nmuch way agin the strong current of the river, so we put ashore again\r\nand took to our legs.\r\n\r\n\"After making a long tramp up the banks o' the river, we fell in with\r\nsome good-sized pines; but although they are big for this part of the\r\ncountry, they are not big enough for building.  Then we pushed into the\r\ngullies, which are sheltered from the cold winds off the bay, and here\r\nwe found the trees a good deal bigger.  There are pines and larch in\r\nabundance, and some of the larch are even bigger than we require.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they far inland?\" inquired Stanley.\r\n\r\n\"No, monsieur, they are only a few hundred yards from the banks of the\r\nriver, and growin' on the edge of a small creek, which I noticed is deep\r\nenough to float them down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, very good,\" said Stanley, filling his pipe with a fresh charge of\r\ntobacco; \"that is most fortunate, for it will save time, and take fewer\r\nmen to bring them here.  Go on, Francois.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bien, monsieur.  Then I felled one or two o' the trees, to see what\r\nlike they are; and I found that they are very tough and good.  The pines\r\nare firmer and tougher than any I ever saw in the Indian country, owing,\r\nI suppose, to their stunted growth.  While I was thus employed, Augustus\r\nshot the grouse we brought home, and we saw a great many coveys of them.\r\nIn fact, we might have shot many more; but as we did not know how far\r\nwe should have to walk, we thought it best not to burden ourselves too\r\nmuch.  We also saw a great many ducks, and shot a few, as you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see goose?\" inquired La Roche, whose mind had a natural\r\ntendency to culinary matters.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Francois, \"I saw no geese; but I did not go out of my way\r\nto look for them.  I was more taken up with the timber than replenishing\r\nthe kettle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that ver' great pity.  Oui, grand dommage.  De kittle toujours de\r\nmost importance t'ing on de voyage.  If you forget him, you goot for\r\nnot'ing.  Mais, Francois, did you look into the deep clear pool at de\r\nfoot of de rapid?\"\r\n\r\nFrancois emitted a cloud of smoke with a negative in the middle of it.\r\n\r\n\"An!\" said La Roche with a sigh, \"I thought not; mais it was pity.  You\r\nsee one goose for certain, if you have look straight down into dat\r\npool.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bien,\" continued Francois, turning to Stanley.  \"I then went into one\r\nor two more gullies, and saw some more sticks fit for building; but\r\nafter all it is only in the gullies they grow, and there are not very\r\nmany.  The trees on the banks of the river are chiefly pines, and only\r\nfit for firewood.\"\r\n\r\n\"And an important item is firewood, as we shall find ere long,\" remarked\r\nStanley.  \"Your account of the timber is very satisfactory, Francois.\r\nDid you see traces of Indians or Esquimaux?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I saw none.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you did, Prince,\" continued Stanley, turning to that worthy,\r\nwho was stretched, along with Massan, at full length before the blaze,\r\nand had been listening attentively to the conversation while he solaced\r\nhimself with his pipe.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, we seed the marks they left behind them,\" answered Prince,\r\nwhile he glanced towards Massan, as if to invite him to give the desired\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, we saw their marks, no doubt,\" said the guide, knocking the ashes\r\nout of his pipe, and raising himself from his reclining posture to that\r\nof a tailor, the more conveniently to recharge that beloved implement.\r\n\"Ay, we saw their marks, and they was by no means pleasant to look on.\r\nAfter we had landed above the p'int, as Francois told ye, Dick Prince\r\nand me went up one o' the gullies, an' then gettin' on one o' them flat\r\nplaces that run along the face of all the mountains hereabouts, we\r\npushed straight up the river.  We had not gone far when, on turnin' a\r\np'int, we both clapped eyes at the same moment on the most ill-lookin'\r\nblackguard of a wolf I ever saw.  Up went both our guns at once, and I\r\nbelieve we were very near puttin' a bullet in each of his eyes, when we\r\nnoticed that these same eyes were not bookin' at us, but starin', most\r\nawful earnest like, up a gully in the mountains; so we looked up, an',\r\nsure enough, there we saw a deer on the mountain-top, tossin' its head\r\nand snuffin' round to see that the coast was clear before it came down\r\nto the water.  We noticed that a regular beaten deer-track passed down\r\nthis gully, and master wolf, who knowed the walk very well, was on the\r\nlookout for his dinner; so we waited quiet till the deer came down, an'\r\nDick put a bullet in its heart, an' I put one into the wolf's head, so\r\nthey both tumbled down the cliffs together.  The shot made another deer,\r\nthat we had not seen, start off into the river; but before it got a few\r\nyards from the shore, Dick loaded again and put a bullet into its head\r\ntoo, an' it was washed ashore at the p'int below us.\r\n\r\n\"Havin' fixed them off comfortably, we cut up the deer, and put all we\r\ncould carry on our shoulders, for we knowed that if we left them we'd\r\nfind nothin' but the bones when we came back.  About an hour after this\r\nwe came upon a deserted camp of Indians.  It was so fresh that we think\r\nthey must have passed but a few weeks ago.  The whole camp was strewed\r\nwith bones of deer, as if the red varmints had been havin' a feast.  An'\r\nsure enough, a little farther on we came upon the dead carcasses of\r\nninety-three deer!  The rascals had taken nothin' but the tongues an'\r\ntit-bits, leavin' the rest for the wolves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, they're a reckless, improvident set,\" remarked Stanley.  \"I've been\r\ntold that the Esquimaux are quite different in this respect.  They never\r\nkill what they don't require; but the redskins slaughter the deer by\r\ndozens for the sake of their tongues.\"\r\n\r\n\"We also found the broken head of an Esquimau seal-spear, and this\r\nlittle bit of sealskin.\"  Massan handed these as he spoke to Stanley.\r\n\r\n\"I fear,\" said Frank, \"this looks as if they had made an attack on the\r\nEsquimaux very recently.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear it much,\" said Stanley, examining the little shred of sealskin,\r\nwhich had beautifully glossy hair on one side, and on the other, which\r\nwas dressed, there were sundry curious marks, one of which bore a rude\r\nresemblance to an Indian wigwam, with an arrow pointing towards it.\r\n\r\n\"I found the bit o' sealskin hanging on a bush a little apart from the\r\nplace where they camped, an' from what I've seen o' the ways o'\r\nredskins, it's my 'pinion that it was put there for some purpose or\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely.--Take care of it, Jessie,\" said Stanley, throwing it to\r\nhis wife; \"it may be explained some day.--Well, Massan, did you see any\r\nother animals?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, lots o' them.  We saw deer on the hill-tops, and might ha'\r\nshot more o' them if we could have brought them into camp.  An' we saw\r\nporcupines in all the pine bluffs.  An' we saw fish in the lakes among\r\nthe mountains.  There are lots o' them lakes--small things some o'\r\nthem--in all the gullies, and fish in most o' them; but we had neither\r\nlines nor hooks, so we catched none.\"\r\n\r\n\"Faix, if ye catched none, yer betters catched plinty,\" said Bryan, who,\r\nhaving concluded supper and changed his garments, was now luxuriating in\r\na smoke.  The blacksmith pointed as he spoke to the bag of splendid\r\ntrout which lay at a short distance from the fire.  \"'Tis mysilf's the\r\nboy to catch them.  I would have brought ye two times as much, if it\r\nwasn't that I lost my hook and line.  I think it must have bin a\r\nfresh-water whale, the last wan, bad luck to it! for it pulled me into\r\nthe wather three times, an' wint off at last with two fathom o' cod-line\r\ntrailin' behind it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So then, Bryan,\" said Frank, \"it must have been the yells with which\r\nyou accompanied your fishing that frightened the deer I was after and\r\ncaused me to lose him.  However, as I got another soon afterwards which\r\nmust have been frightened towards me by the same halloos, I forgive\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nFrank now gave the party an account of what he had seen, but as his\r\nexperience merely corroborated that of Dick Prince and Massan, we will\r\nnot trouble the reader with the details.  The evidence of the various\r\nexploring parties, when summed up, was undoubtedly most satisfactory,\r\nand while it relieved the mind of the leaders of the band, it raised and\r\ncheered the spirits of the men.  Timber, although not plentiful or very\r\nlarge, was to be had close to the spot where they proposed to erect\r\ntheir fort; game of all kinds swarmed in the mountains in abundance; and\r\nthe lakes and rivers were well stocked with excellent fish: so that,\r\nupon the whole, they considered that they had made an auspicious\r\ncommencement to their sojourn in the land of the Esquimaux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nOUTPOST-BUILDING--FORT CHIMO--AN UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL, WHICH CAUSES MUCH\r\nJOY.\r\n\r\nThe band of fur-traders now set earnestly about the erection of their\r\nwinter dwelling.  The season was so far advanced that the men could no\r\nlonger be spared from the work to hunt or fish in the mountains, so that\r\nthey lived chiefly on the produce of the stake-nets in front of the\r\ncamp, and a small allowance of the provisions with which they had\r\nstarted from Moose Fort.  Occasionally Frank sallied forth and returned\r\nwith the best parts of a deer on his shoulders; but these excursions\r\nwere rare, as both he and Stanley worked with the men in the erection of\r\nthe fort.  No one was idle for a moment, from the time of rising--\r\nshortly after daybreak--to the time of going to rest at night.  Even\r\nlittle Edith found full occupation in assisting her mother in the\r\nperformance of a host of little household duties, too numerous to\r\nrecapitulate.  The dog Chimo was the only exception to the general rule.\r\nHe hunted the greater part of the forenoon, for his own special\r\nbenefit, and slept when not thus occupied, or received with\r\nphilosophical satisfaction the caresses of his young mistress.\r\n\r\nThe future fort was begun on the centre of the level patch of\r\ngreen-sward at the foot of the flat rock by the spring, where the party\r\nhad originally encamped.  A square was traced on the ground to indicate\r\nthe stockade; and within this, Stanley marked off an oblong patch, close\r\nto the back stockade, for the principal dwelling-house, facing the\r\nriver.  Two other spaces were on either side of this--one for a store,\r\nthe other for a dwelling for the men.  When finished, the fort would\r\nthus have the form of three sides of a square surrounded by a stockade.\r\nIn the centre of this, and the first thing that was erected, was a\r\nflag-staff, on which the H.B.C.--Hudson's Bay Company--flag was hoisted,\r\nand saluted with three cheers as its crimson folds fluttered out in the\r\nbreeze for the first time.  The plan on which the houses were\r\nconstructed was that on which all the dwellings of the fur-traders are\r\nbuilt--namely, a framework of timber, the interstices of which are\r\nfilled up with logs sliding into grooves cut in the main posts and\r\nbeams.  This manner of building is so simple that a house can be erected\r\nwithout any other instruments than an axe, an auger, and a large chisel;\r\nand the speed with which it is put up would surprise those whose notions\r\nof house-building are limited to stone edifices.\r\n\r\nThe axes of the wood-cutters resounded among the gullies and ravines of\r\nUngava, and awakened the numerous echoes of the mountains.  The\r\nencampment no longer presented a green spot, watered by a tiny rill, but\r\nwas strewn with logs in all stages of formation, and chips innumerable.\r\nThe frameworks of the dwelling-houses began to rise from the earth,\r\npresenting, in their unfinished condition, a bristling, uncomfortable\r\nappearance, suggesting thoughts in the beholder's mind highly\r\ndisparaging to art, and deeply sympathetic with outraged nature.  The\r\ntents still stood, and the campfire burned, but the superior proportions\r\nof the rising fort threw these entirely into the shade.  A rude wharf of\r\nunbarked logs ran from the beach into the river.  It had been begun and\r\nfinished in a couple of days, for the convenience of Gaspard while\r\nvisiting his nets, as he sometimes did before the water left them.\r\nEverything, in short, bore evidence of the most bustling activity and\r\npersevering energy; and in a few weeks from the time of their first\r\nlanding, the dwelling-houses were sufficiently weather-tight to be\r\nhabitable, and the other portions of the establishment in an advanced\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe openings between the logs of the houses were caulked with a mixture\r\nof mud and moss, and left in that condition in the meantime, until the\r\npit-saw could be set to work to produce boards for the better protection\r\nof the walls without and within.  The window and door frames were also\r\nmade, and covered temporarily with parchment, until the arrival of the\r\nship should enable them to fill the former with glass and the latter\r\nwith broad panels.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the parchment-covered door, however, was found to be\r\nsomewhat troublesome.  Being large, and tightly covered, it sounded,\r\nwhen shut violently, with a noise so strongly resembling the report of a\r\ndistant cannon that, during the first day after its erection, the men\r\nmore than once rushed down to the beach in the expectation of seeing the\r\nlong and ardently wished-for ship, which was now so much beyond the time\r\nappointed for her arrival that Stanley began to entertain serious\r\napprehensions for her safety.  This ship was to have sailed from York\r\nFort, the principal depot of the fur-traders in Hudson's Bay, with\r\nsupplies and goods for trade with the Esquimaux during the year.  She\r\nwas expected at Ungava in August, and it was now September.  The frost\r\nwas beginning, even at this early period, to remind the expedition of\r\nthe long winter that was at hand, and in the course of a very few weeks\r\nHudson's Straits would be impassable; so that the anxiety of the traders\r\nwas natural.\r\n\r\nJust before the partitions of the chief dwelling-house were completed,\r\nStanley went to the tent in which his wife and child were busily\r\nemployed in sewing.\r\n\r\n\"Can you spare Edith for a short time, wife?\" said he, as his partner\r\nlooked up to welcome him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for a short time; but she is becoming so useful to me that I\r\ncannot afford to spare her long.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid,\" said Stanley, as he took his child by the hand and led her\r\naway, \"that I must begin to put in my claim to the services of this\r\nlittle baggage, who seems to be so useful.  What say you, Eda; will you\r\nallow me to train you to shoot, and fish, and walk on snow-shoes, and so\r\nmake a trader of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would like very much, papa, to learn to walk on snowshoes, but I\r\nthink the gun would hurt me--it seems to kick so.  Don't you think I am\r\ntoo little to shoot a gun off?\"\r\n\r\nStanley laughed at the serious way in which the child received the\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, we won't teach you to shoot yet, Eda; but, as you say, the\r\nsnow-shoe walking is worth learning, for if you cannot walk on the long\r\nshoes when the snow falls, I fear you'll not be able to leave the fort\r\nat all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and Francois has promised to make me a pair,\" said Edith gaily,\r\n\"and to teach me how to use them; and mamma says I am old enough to\r\nlearn now.  Is it not kind of Francois?  He is always very good to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed it is very kind of him, my pet; but all the men seem to be very\r\ngood to you--are they not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes!--all of them.  Even Gaspard is kind now.  He never whips Chimo,\r\nand he patted me on the head the other day when I met him alone in the\r\nravine--the berry ravine, you know, where I go to gather berries.  I\r\nwonder if there are berries in all the other ravines?--but I don't care\r\nmuch, for there are thousands and thousands of all kinds in my own\r\nravine, and--where are you going, papa?\"\r\n\r\nThis abrupt question was caused by her father turning into the square of\r\nthe new fort, in which the most of the men were at work.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to show you our house, Eda, and to ask you to fix on the\r\ncorner you like best for your own room.  The partitions are going to be\r\nput up, so we must fix at once.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke they passed through the open doorway of the new dwelling,\r\nwhich was a long, low building; and, placing his little daughter in the\r\ncentre of the principal hall, Stanley directed her to look round and\r\nchoose a corner for herself.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes Edith stood with an expression of perplexity on her\r\nbright face; then she began to examine the views from each of the corner\r\nwindows.  This could only be done by peeping through the bullet-hole in\r\nthe parchment skins that in the meantime did duty for glass.  The two\r\nwindows at the back corners looked out upon the rocky platform, behind\r\nwhich the mountains rose like a wall, so they were rejected; but Edith\r\nlingered at one of them, for from it she saw the spring at the foot of\r\nthe rock, with its soft bed of green moss and surrounding willow-bushes.\r\nFrom the front corner on the left hand Cross Island and the valley of\r\nthe river beyond were visible; but from the window on the right the view\r\nembraced the whole sweep of the wide river and the narrow outlet to the\r\nbay, which, with its frowning precipices on either side, and its bold\r\nflanking mountains, seemed a magnificent portal to the Arctic Sea.\r\n\r\n\"I think this is the nicest corner,\" said Edith, turning with a smile to\r\nher father.\r\n\r\n\"Then this shall be yours,\" said Stanley.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" exclaimed Edith, as a sudden thought occurred to her, \"perhaps\r\nFrank would like this corner.  I would not like to have it if Frank\r\nwants it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frank doesn't want it, and Frank shan't have it.  There now, run to\r\nyour mother, you little baggage; she can't get on without you.  Off you\r\ngo, quick!\"\r\n\r\nWith a merry laugh Edith bounded through the doorway, and disappeared\r\nlike a sunbeam from the room.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of September, Stanley was standing on the beach, opposite\r\nthe fort, watching with a smile of satisfaction the fair, happy face of\r\nhis daughter, as she amused herself and Chimo by throwing a stick into\r\nthe water, which the latter dutifully brought out and laid at her feet\r\nas often as it was thrown in.  Frank was also watching them.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we call the fort, Frank?\" said his companion.  \"We have a\r\nFort Good Hope, and a Fort Resolution, and a Fort Enterprise already.\r\nIt seems as if all the vigorous and hearty words in the English language\r\nwere used up in naming the forts of the Hudson's Bay Company.  What\r\nshall we call it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Chimo!  Chimo!  Chimo!\" shouted Edith to the dog, as the animal bounded\r\nalong the beach.\r\n\r\nBoth gentlemen seemed to be struck with the same idea simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\"There's an answer to your question,\" said Frank; \"call the fort\r\n`Chimo.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The very thing!\" replied Stanley; \"I wonder it did not occur to me\r\nbefore.  Nothing could be more appropriate.  I salute thee, Fort Chimo,\"\r\nand Stanley lifted his cap to the establishment.\r\n\r\nIn order that the peculiar appropriateness of the name may appear to the\r\nreader, it may be as well to explain that Chimo (the _i_ and _o_ of\r\nwhich are sounded long) is an Esquimau word of salutation, and is used\r\nby the natives when they meet with strangers.  It signifies, _Are you\r\nfriendly_? by those who speak first, and seems to imply, _We are\r\nfriendly_, when returned as an answer.  So well known is the word to the\r\nfur-traders who traffic with the natives of Hudson's Straits that they\r\nfrequently apply it to them as a name, and speak of the Esquimaux as\r\nChimos.  It was, therefore, a peculiarly appropriate name for a fort\r\nwhich was established on the confines of these icy regions, for the\r\ndouble purpose of entering into friendly traffic with the Esquimaux, and\r\nof bringing about friendly relations between them and their old enemies,\r\nthe Muskigon Indians of East Main.\r\n\r\nAfter playing for some time beside the low wharf, Edith and her dog left\r\nthe beach together, and rambled towards a distant eminence, whence could\r\nbe obtained a commanding bird's-eye view of the new fort.  She had not\r\nsat many minutes here when her eye was arrested by the appearance of an\r\nunusual object in the distance.  Frank, who was yet engaged in\r\nconversation with Stanley on the beach, also noticed it.  Laying his\r\nhand on the arm of his companion, he pointed towards the narrows, where\r\na small, white, triangular object was visible against the dark cliff.\r\nAs they gazed, a second object of similar form came into view; then a\r\nfore and top sail made their appearance; and, in another second, a\r\nschooner floated slowly through the opening!  Ere the spectators of this\r\nsilent apparition could give utterance to their joy, a puff of white\r\nsmoke sprang from the vessel's bow, and a cannon-shot burst upon the\r\nmountains.  Leaping on from cliff to crag, it awakened a crash of\r\nmagnificent echoes, which, after prolonged repetitions, died away in low\r\nmutterings like distant thunder.  It was followed by a loud cheer from\r\nthe schooner's deck, and the H.B.C. flag was run up to the main, while\r\nthe Union Jack floated at the peak.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Frank, give the word,\" cried Stanley, taking off his cap, while\r\nthe men ran down to the beach _en masse_.\r\n\r\n\"Hip, hip, hurrah!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" echoed the men, and a cheer arose among the cliffs that moved\r\nto the very centre the hearts of those who heard and gave it.\r\n\r\nAgain and again the stirring shout arose from the fort, and was replied\r\nto from the schooner.  It was no matter of form, or cheer of ceremony.\r\nThere was a deep richness and a prolonged energy in the tone, which\r\nproved that the feelings and lungs of the men were roused to the\r\nuttermost in its delivery.  It told of long gathering anxieties swept\r\nentirely away, and of deep joy at seeing friendly faces in a sterile\r\nland, where lurking foes might be more likely to appear.\r\n\r\nAt all times the entrance of a ship into port is a noble sight, and one\r\nwhich touches the heart and evokes the enthusiasm of almost every human\r\nbeing; but when the ship arriving is almost essential to the existence\r\nof those who watch her snowy sails swelling out as they urge her to the\r\nland--when her keel is the first that has ever ploughed the waters of\r\ntheir distant bay--and when her departure will lock them up in solitude\r\nfor a long, long year--such feelings are roused to their utmost pitch of\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\nCheer upon cheer rose and fell, and rose again, among the mountains of\r\nUngava.  Even Edith's tiny voice helped to swell the enthusiastic shout;\r\nand more than one cheer was choked by the rising tide of emotion that\r\nforced the tears down more than one bronzed cheek, despite the iron\r\nwills that bade them not to flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nBUSTLE AND BUSINESS--A GREAT FEAST, IN WHICH BRYAN AND LA ROCHE ARE\r\nPRIME MOVERS--NEW IDEAS IN THE ART OF COOKING.\r\n\r\nThe scene at Fort Chimo was more bustling and active than ever during\r\nthe week that followed the arrival of the schooner.  The captain told\r\nStanley, as they sat sipping a glass of Madeira in the hall of the new\r\nfort, that he had been delayed by ice in the straits so long, that the\r\nmen were afraid of being set fast for the winter, and were almost in a\r\nstate of mutiny, when they fortunately discovered the mouth of the\r\nriver.  As had been anticipated by Stanley, the ship entered False River\r\nby mistake, unseen by Oolibuck, notwithstanding the vigilance of his\r\nlookout.  Fortunately he observed it as it came out of the river, just\r\nat the critical period when the seamen began to threaten to take the law\r\ninto their own hands if the search were continued any longer.  Oolibuck\r\nno sooner beheld the object of his hopes than he rushed to the top of a\r\nhill, where he made a fire and sent up a column of smoke that had the\r\nimmediate effect of turning the vessel's head towards him.  Soon\r\nafterwards a boat was sent ashore, and took the Esquimau on board, who\r\nexplained, in his broken English, that he had been watching for them for\r\nmany days, and would be happy to pilot the vessel up to the fort.\r\n\r\n\"You may be sure,\" continued the captain, \"that I was too happy to give\r\nthe ship in charge to the fellow, who seemed to understand thoroughly\r\nwhat he was about.  He is already quite a favourite with the men, who\r\ncall him Oily-buss, much to his own amusement; and he has excited their\r\nadmiration and respect by his shooting, having twice on the way up shot\r\na goose on the wing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not an unusual exhibition of skill among fur-traders,\" said Stanley;\r\n\"but I suppose your men are not much used to the gun.  And now, captain,\r\nwhen must you start?\"\r\n\r\n\"The moment the cargo is landed, sir,\" replied the captain, who was\r\ndistinguished by that thorough self-sufficiency and prompt energy of\r\ncharacter which seem peculiar to sea-captains in general.  \"We may have\r\ntrouble in getting out of the straits, and, after getting to Quebec, I\r\nam bound to carry a cargo of timber to England.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do my best to help you, captain.  Your coming has relieved my\r\nmind from a load of anxiety, and one good turn deserves another, so I'll\r\nmake my fellows work night and day till your ship is discharged.\"\r\n\r\nStanley was true to his word.  Not only did the men work almost without\r\nintermission, but he and Frank Morton scarce allowed themselves an\r\nhour's repose during the time that the work was going on.  Night and day\r\n\"yo heave ho\" of the Jack Tars rang over the water; and the party on\r\nshore ran to and fro, from the beach to the store, with bales, kegs,\r\nbarrels, and boxes on their shoulders.  There were blankets and guns,\r\nand axes and knives, powder and shot, and beads and awls, and nets and\r\ntwine.  There were kettles of every sort and size; cloth of every hue;\r\ncapotes of all dimensions, and minute etceteras without end: so that,\r\nhad it been possible to prevail on the spirits of the ice to carry to\r\nthe Esquimaux intelligence of the riches contained in the store at\r\nChimo, an overwhelming flood of visitors would speedily have descended\r\non that establishment.  But no such messengers could be found--although\r\nBryan asserted positively that more than \"wan o' them\" had been seen by\r\nhim since his arrival; so the traders had nothing for it but to summon\r\npatience to their aid and bide their time.\r\n\r\nWhen the work of discharging was completed, and while Stanley and the\r\ncaptain were standing on the beach watching the removal of the last\r\nboat-load to the store, the former said to the latter: \"Now, captain, I\r\nhave a favour to request, which is that you and your two mates will dine\r\nwith me to-morrow.  Your men will be the better of a day's rest after\r\nsuch a long spell of hard work.  You could not well get away till the\r\nevening of to-morrow at any rate, on account of the tide, and it will be\r\nsafer and more pleasant to start early on the day after.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be most happy,\" replied the captain heartily.\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" said Stanley.  \"Dinner will be ready by four o'clock\r\nprecisely; and give my compliments to your crew, and say that my men\r\nwill expect them all to dinner at the same hour.\"\r\n\r\nTen minutes after this, Stanley entered his private apartment in the\r\nfort, which, under the tasteful management of his wife, was beginning to\r\nlook elegant and comfortable.\r\n\r\n\"Wife,\" said he, \"I will order La Roche to send you a box of raisins and\r\nan unlimited supply of flour, butter, etcetera, wherewith you will be so\r\nkind as to make, or cause to be made--on pain of my utmost displeasure\r\nin the event of failure--a plum-pudding large enough to fill the largest\r\nsized washing-tub, and another of about quarter that size; both to be\r\nready boiled by four to-morrow afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, your commands shall be obeyed.  I suppose you intend to regale the\r\nsailors before they leave.  Is it not so?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have guessed rightly for once; and take care that you don't let Eda\r\ndrown herself in the compost before it is tied up.  I must hasten to\r\nprepare the men.\"\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later and Stanley stood in the midst of his men, who, having\r\nfinished their day's work, were now busy with supper in their new house,\r\ninto which they had but recently moved.\r\n\r\n\"Lads,\" said Stanley, \"you have stuck to your work so hard of late that\r\nI think it a pity to allow you to fall into lazy habits again.  I expect\r\nyou all to be up by break of day to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och! musha!\" sighed Bryan, as he laid down his knife and fork with a\r\nlook of consternation.\r\n\r\n\"I have invited the ship's crew,\" continued Stanley, \"to dine with you\r\nbefore they leave us.  As the larder is low just now, you'll all have to\r\ntake to the hills for a fresh supply.  Make your arrangements as you\r\nplease, but see that there is no lack of venison and fish.  I'll\r\nguarantee the pudding and grog.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he turned and left the house, followed by a tremendous cheer.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! parbleu! vat shall I do?\" said La Roche, with a look of affected\r\ndespair.  \"I am most dead for vant of sleep already.  C'est impossible\r\nto cook pour everybody demain.  I vill be sure to fall 'sleep over de\r\nfire, prehaps fall into him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och, Losh, Losh, when will ye larn to think nothin' o' yoursilf?  Ye'll\r\nonly have to cook for the bourgeois; but think o' me!  All the min, an'\r\nthe ship's crew to boot!\"\r\n\r\nThe blacksmith concluded by knocking La Roche's pipe out of his mouth,\r\nin the excess of his glee at the prospective feast; after which he\r\nbegged his pardon solemnly in bad French, and ducked his head to avoid\r\nthe tin can that was hurled at it by the indignant Frenchman.\r\n\r\nAt the first streak of dawn the following morning, and long before the\r\nsun looked down into the ravines of Ungava, Massan and Dick Prince were\r\nseen to issue with noiseless steps from the fort, with their guns on\r\ntheir shoulders, and betake themselves to the mountains.  Half an hour\r\nlater Bryan staggered out of the house, with a bag on his shoulder,\r\nscarcely half awake, rubbing his eyes and muttering to himself in a low\r\ntone, as he plunged rather than walked into the ravine which led to the\r\nfirst terrace on the mountain.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun rose over the mountain-tops and looked down upon the calm\r\nsurface of the river, there was not a man remaining in the fort, with\r\nthe exception of Stanley and Frank, and their active servant La Roche.\r\n\r\nA deep calm rested on the whole scene.  The sailors of the vessel,\r\nhaving risen to dispatch breakfast, retired to their hammocks again and\r\nwent to sleep; Stanley, Frank, and their household, were busy within\r\ndoors; Chimo snored in the sunshine at the front of the fort; and the\r\nschooner floated on a sheet of water so placid, that every spar and\r\ndelicate rope was clearly reflected.  Nothing was heard save the soft\r\nripple on the shore, the distant murmur of mountain streams, and, once\r\nor twice through the day, the faint reverberation of a fowling-piece.\r\n\r\nBut as the day advanced, evidences of the approaching feast began to be\r\napparent.  Early in the forenoon Massan and Prince returned with heavy\r\nloads of venison on their shoulders, and an hour later Bryan staggered\r\ninto the fort bending under the weight of a well-filled bag of fish.  He\r\nhad been at his favourite fishing quarters in the dark valley, and was\r\ndripping wet from head to foot, having fallen, as usual, into the water.\r\nBryan had a happy facility in falling into the water that was quite\r\nunaccountable--and rather enviable in warm weather.  As the cooking\r\noperations were conducted on an extensive scale, a fire was kindled in\r\nthe open air in the rear of the men's house; round which fire, in the\r\ncourse of the forenoon, Bryan and La Roche performed feats of agility so\r\nextravagant, and apparently so superhuman, that they seemed to involve\r\nan element of wickedness from their very intensity.  Of course no large\r\ndinner ever passed through the ordeal of being cooked without some\r\naccidents or misfortunes, more or less.  Even in civilised life, where\r\nthe most intricate appliances are brought to bear on the operation by\r\n_artistes_ thoroughly acquainted with their profession, infallibility is\r\nnot found.  It would be unjust, therefore, to expect that two\r\nbackwoodsmen should be perfectly successful, especially when it is\r\nremembered that their branch of the noble science was what might be\r\ntechnically termed plain cookery, the present being their first attempt\r\nin the higher branches.\r\n\r\nTheir first difficulty arose from the larger of the two plum-puddings,\r\nwhich La Roche had compounded under the directions of Mrs Stanley and\r\nthe superintendence of Edith.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Losh,\" cried Bryan to his companion, whose head was at the\r\nmoment hid from view in a cloud of steam that ascended from a large pot\r\nover which he bent, apparently muttering incantations.\r\n\r\n\"Vell, fat you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Faix, and it's just _fat_ that I don't want,\" said Bryan, pointing, as\r\nhe spoke, to the large pudding, which, being much too large for the\r\nkettle, was standing on the rim thereof like the white ball of foam that\r\ncaps a tankard of double X.  \"It's more nor twice too fat already.  The\r\nkittle won't hould it, no how.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, stuff him down, dat is de way,\" suggested La Roche.\r\n\r\n\"Stuff it down, avic, an' what's to come o' the wather?\" said Bryan.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! true, dat is perplexible, vraiment.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the large pot boiled over and a cloud of scalding steam\r\nengulfed the sympathetic Frenchman, causing him to yell with mingled\r\npain and rage as he bounded backwards.\r\n\r\n\"Musha! but ye'll come to an early death, Losh, if ye don't be more\r\ncareful o' yer dried-up body.\"\r\n\r\n\"Taisez vous, donc,\" muttered his companion, half angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Taisin' ye? avic, sorra wan o' me's taisin' ye.  But since ye can't\r\nhelp me out o' me throubles, I'll try to help mysilf.\"\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this noble resolve, Bryan went to the store and fetched\r\nfrom thence another large tin kettle.  He then undid the covering of the\r\nunwieldy pudding, which he cut into two equal parts, and having squeezed\r\nthem into two balls, tied them up in the cloth, which he divided for the\r\npurpose, and put them into the separate kettles, with the air of a man\r\nwho had overcome a great difficulty by dint of unfathomable wisdom.  It\r\nwas found, however, that the smaller pudding, intended for Stanley's\r\ntable, was also too large for its kettle; but the energetic blacksmith,\r\nwhose genius was now thoroughly aroused, overcame this difficulty by\r\ncutting off several pounds of it, and transferring the pudding thus\r\nreduced to the kettle, saying in an undertone as he did so, \"There's\r\nmore nor enough for the six o' ye yit, av yer only raisonable in yer\r\nappetites.\"\r\n\r\nBut the superfluity of the pudding thus caused became now a new source\r\nof trouble to Bryan.\r\n\r\n\"What's to be done wid it, Losh?  I don't like to give it to the dogs,\r\nan' it's too small intirely to make a dumplin' of.\"\r\n\r\n\"You better heat him raw,\" suggested La Roche.\r\n\r\n\"Faix, an' I've half a mind to; but it would spile my dinner.  Hallo!\r\nlook out for the vainison, Losh.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, oui; oh! misere!\" cried La Roche, springing over the fire, and\r\ngiving a turn to the splendid haunch of venison which depended from a\r\nwooden tripod in front of the blaze, and, having been neglected for a\r\nfew minutes, was beginning to singe.\r\n\r\n\"What have ye in the pot there?\" inquired Bryan.\r\n\r\n\"Von goose, two duck, trois plovre, et von leetle bird--I not know de\r\nname of--put him in pour experiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, Losh; out wid the goose and we'll cram the bit o' dumplin'\r\ninto him for stuffin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! superb, excellent,\" cried La Roche, laughing, as he lifted out the\r\ngoose, into which Bryan thrust the mass of superfluous pudding; after\r\nwhich the hole was tied up and the bird re-consigned to the pot.\r\n\r\nEverything connected with this dinner was strikingly suggestive of the\r\ncircumstances under which it was given.  The superabundance of venison\r\nand wild-fowl; the cooking done in the open air; the absence of women,\r\nand the performance of work usually allotted to them by bronzed and\r\nstalwart voyageurs; the wild scenery in the midst of which it took\r\nplace; and the mixture of Irish, English, French, Indian, Esquimau, and\r\ncompound tones, that fell upon the ear as the busy work went on,--all\r\ntended to fill the mind with a feeling of wild romance, and to suggest\r\npowerfully the idea of being, if we may so express it, _far, far away_!\r\nAs the proceedings advanced towards completion, this feeling was rather\r\nincreased than removed.\r\n\r\nTables and chairs were a luxury that still remained to be introduced at\r\nFort Chimo, when the men found leisure from more urgent duties to\r\nconstruct them.  Therefore the dining-table in Stanley's hall was\r\ncomposed of three large packing-cases turned bottom up.  There was no\r\ncloth wherewith to cover its rough boards; but this was a matter of\r\nlittle importance to the company which assembled round it, punctually at\r\nthe hour of four.  In place of chairs there were good substantial\r\nnail-kegs, rather low, it is true, and uncommonly hard, but not to be\r\ndespised under the circumstances.  Owing to the unusual demand for\r\ndishes, the pewter plates and spoons and tin drinking-cups--for they had\r\nlittle crockery--were of every form and size that the store contained;\r\nand the floor on which it all stood was the beaten ground, for the\r\nintended plank flooring was still growing in the mountain glens.\r\n\r\nBut if the equipage was homely and rude, the fare was choice and\r\nabundant; and an odour that might have gladdened the heart of an epicure\r\ngreeted the nostrils of the captain and his two mates when they entered\r\nthe hall, dressed in blue surtouts with bright brass buttons, white duck\r\ntrousers, and richly flowered vests [waistcoats].  There was a splendid\r\nsalmon, of twenty pounds weight, at one end of the board; and beside it,\r\non the same dish, a lake-trout of equal size and beauty.  At the other\r\nend smoked a haunch of venison, covered with at least an inch of fat;\r\nand beside it a bowl of excellent cranberry jam, the handiwork of the\r\nhostess.  A boiled goose and pease-pudding completed the catalogue.\r\nAfterwards, these gave place to the pudding which had caused Bryan so\r\nmuch perplexity, and several dishes of raisins and figs.  Last, but not\r\nleast, there was a bottle of brandy and two of port wine; which, along\r\nwith the raisins and figs, formed part of the limited supply of luxuries\r\nfurnished by the Hudson's Bay Company to Stanley, in common with all the\r\ngentlemen in the service, in order to enable them, now and then, on\r\ngreat occasions, to recall, through the medium of a feast, the\r\nremembrance of civilised life.\r\n\r\nThe display in the men's house was precisely similar to that in the\r\nhall.  But the table was larger and the viands more abundant.  The\r\nraisins and figs, too, were wanting; and instead of wine or brandy,\r\nthere was a small supply of rum.  It was necessarily small, being the\r\ngift of Stanley out of his own diminutive store, which could not, even\r\nif desired, be replenished until the return of the ship next autumn.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the guests a strange contrast was presented.  The\r\nsailors, in white ducks, blue jackets with brass buttons, striped\r\nshirts, pumps, and straw hats, landed at the appointed hour, and in\r\nhearty good-humour swaggered towards the men's house, where they were\r\npolitely received by the quiet, manly-looking voyageurs, who, in honour\r\nof the occasion, had put on their best capotes, their brightest belts,\r\ntheir gayest garters, and most highly-ornamented moccasins.  The French\r\nCanadians and half-breeds bowed, shook hands, and addressed the tars as\r\n_messieurs_.  The sailors laughed, slapped their entertainers on the\r\nshoulders, and called them messmates.  The Indians stood, grave and\r\nsilent, but with looks of good-humour, in the background; while the\r\nEsquimaux raised their fat cheeks, totally shut up their eyes, and\r\ngrinned perpetually, not to say horribly, from ear to ear.  But the\r\nbabel that followed is beyond the powers of description, therefore we\r\nwon't attempt it.\r\n\r\nHere, however, the characteristic peculiarity of our scene ceases.  The\r\nactual demolition of food is pretty much the same among all nations that\r\nare not absolutely savage; and, however much contrast might have been\r\nobserved in the strange mixture of human beings assembled under the\r\nhospitable roof of Fort Chimo, there was none whatever in the manner in\r\nwhich they demolished their viands.  As the evening advanced, a message\r\nwas sent to Monsieur Stanley for the loan of his violin.\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" said he, as the instrument was delivered to Bryan, who happened to\r\nbe the messenger and also the performer--\"ay, I thought it would come to\r\nthat ere long.  Don't be too hard on the strings, lad.  'Twill be a\r\nrough ball where there are no women.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thrue, yer honour,\" replied the blacksmith, as he received the\r\ninstrument, \"there's a great want of faymales in thim parts; but the\r\nsailors have consinted to ripresint the purty craytures on the present\r\noccasion, which is but right, for, ye see, the most o' thim's shorter\r\nnor us, an' their wide breeches are more like the pitticoats than our\r\nleggin's.\"\r\n\r\nMany were the stories that were told and retold, believed, disbelieved,\r\nand doubted, on that memorable night; and loud were the songs and long\r\nand strong the dancing that followed.  But it was all achieved under the\r\ninfluence of pure animal spirits, for the rum supplied afforded but a\r\nthimbleful to each.  The consequence was that there were no headaches\r\nthe following morning, and the men were up by break of day as fresh and\r\nlight as larks.  A feeling of sadness, however, gradually crept over the\r\nband as the dawn advanced and the schooner prepared for her departure.\r\n\r\nBy six o'clock the flood-tide turned, and a few minutes later all the\r\nsailors were aboard, hoisting the sails and anchor, while the men stood\r\nsilently on the beach where they had just parted from their guests.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye once more, Mr Stanley; good-bye, Mr Morton,\" said the\r\ncaptain, as he stepped into his boat.  \"I wish you a pleasant winter and\r\na good trade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, thank you, captain,\" replied Stanley; \"and don't forget us\r\nout here, in this lonely place, when you drink the health of absent\r\nfriends at Christmas time.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the anchor was up, and the schooner, bending round with\r\na fair wind and tide, made for the narrows.\r\n\r\n\"Give them a cheer, lads,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\nObedient to the command, the men doffed their caps and raised their\r\nvoices; but there was little vigour in the cheer.  It was replied to\r\nfrom the schooner's deck.  Just as the flying-jib passed the point a gun\r\nwas fired, which once more awakened the loud echoes of the place.  When\r\nthe smoke cleared away, the schooner was gone.\r\n\r\nThus was severed the last link that bound the civilised world to the\r\ninhabitants of Fort Chimo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nWINTER APPROACHES--ESQUIMAUX ARRIVE--EFFECT OF A WORD--A SUCKING BABY--\r\nPROSPECTS OF TRADE.\r\n\r\nFor many days after the ship's departure the work of completing the fort\r\nwent forward with the utmost rapidity, and not until the houses and\r\nstores were rendered weather-tight and warm did Stanley consider it\r\nadvisable to send out hunting and fishing parties into the mountains.\r\nNow, however, the frosts continued a great part of the day as well as\r\nduring the night, so it was high time to kill deer and fish, in order to\r\nfreeze, and so preserve them for winter's consumption.\r\n\r\nUp to this time no further traces of Esquimaux had been discovered, and\r\nStanley began to express his fears to Frank that they had left the\r\nneighbourhood altogether, in consequence of the repeated attacks made\r\nupon them by Indians.  Soon after this, however, the fur-traders were\r\nsurprised by a sudden visit from a party of these denizens of the north.\r\n\r\nIt happened on the afternoon of a beautiful day towards the close of\r\nautumn, that charming but brief season which, in consequence of its\r\nunbroken serenity, has been styled the Indian summer.  The men had all\r\nbeen dispatched into the mountains in various directions, some to fish,\r\nothers to shoot; and none were left at the fort except its commandant\r\nwith his wife and child, and Oolibuck the Esquimau.  Stanley was seated\r\non a stone at the margin of the bay, admiring the vivid alterations of\r\nlight and shade, as the sun dipped behind the mountains of the opposite\r\nshore, when his eye was attracted towards one or two objects on the\r\nwater near the narrows.  Presently they advanced, and were followed by\r\nseveral others.  In a few minutes he perceived that they were Esquimau\r\ncanoes.\r\n\r\nJumping hastily up, Stanley ran to the fort, and bidding his wife and\r\nchild keep out of sight, put two pair of pistols in his pockets and\r\nreturned to the beach, where he found Oolibuck gazing at the approaching\r\nflotilla with intense eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Oolibuck, here come your countrymen at last,\" said Stanley.  \"Do\r\nthey look friendly, think you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me no can tell; they most too quiet,\" replied the interpreter.\r\n\r\nEsquimaux in general are extremely noisy and full of animated\r\ngesticulation on meeting with strangers, especially when they meet on\r\ndecidedly friendly terms.  The silence, therefore, maintained by the\r\nnatives as they advanced was looked upon as a bad sign.  The fleet\r\nconsisted of nine kayaks, and three large oomiaks full of women and\r\nchildren; and a curious appearance they presented at a distance, for the\r\nlow kayaks of the men being almost invisible, it seemed as if their\r\noccupants were actually seated on the water.  The oomiaks being much\r\nhigher, were clearly visible.  On coming to within a quarter of a mile\r\nof the fort, the men halted to allow the women to come up; then forming\r\nin a crescent in front of the oomiaks, the whole flotilla advanced\r\nslowly towards the beach.  When within a hundred yards or so, Stanley\r\nsaid, \"Now, Oolibuck, give them a hail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chimo!  Chimo!  Chimo-o-o!\" shouted the interpreter.\r\n\r\nThe word acted like a talisman.\r\n\r\n\"Chimo!\" yelled the Esquimaux in reply, and the kayaks shot like arrows\r\nupon the sand, while the women followed as fast as they could.  In\r\nanother minute a loud chattering and a brisk shaking of hands was taking\r\nplace on shore.\r\n\r\nThe natives were dressed in the sealskin garments with which arctic\r\ntravellers have made us all more or less acquainted.  They were stout\r\nburly fellows, with fat, oily, and bearded faces.\r\n\r\n\"Now tell them, Oolibuck, the reason of our coming here,\" said Stanley.\r\n\r\nOolibuck instantly began, by explaining to them that they had come for\r\nthe purpose of bringing about peace and friendship between them and the\r\nIndians; on hearing which the Esquimaux danced and shouted for nearly a\r\nminute with joy.  But when the interpreter went on to say that they\r\nintended to remain altogether among them, for the purpose of trading,\r\ntheir delight knew no bounds; they danced and jumped, and whooped and\r\nyelled, tossed up their arms and legs, and lay down on the sand and\r\nrolled in ecstasy.  In the midst of all this, Mrs Stanley rushed out of\r\nthe house, followed by Edith, in great terror at the unearthly sounds\r\nthat had reached her ears; but on seeing her husband and Oolibuck\r\nlaughing in the midst of the grotesque group, her fears vanished, and\r\nshe stood an amused spectator of the scene.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Stanley went down and stepped into the midst of one of the\r\noomiaks, with a few beads and trinkets in his hands; and while Oolibuck\r\nentertained the men on shore, he presented gifts to the women, who\r\nreceived them with the most childish demonstrations of joy.  There was\r\nsomething irresistibly comic in the childlike simplicity of these poor\r\nnatives.  Instead of the stiff reserve and haughty demeanour of their\r\nIndian neighbours, they danced and sang, and leaped and roared, embraced\r\neach other and wept, with the most reckless indifference to appearances,\r\nand seemed upon all occasions to give instant vent to the feelings that\r\nhappened to be uppermost in their minds.  As Stanley continued to\r\ndistribute his gifts, the women crowded out of the other oomiaks into\r\nthe one in which he stood, until they nearly sank it; some of them\r\nextending their arms for beads, others giving a jolt to the hoods on\r\ntheir backs, which had the effect of bringing to light fat, greasy-faced\r\nlittle babies, who were pointed to as being peculiarly worthy of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nAt length Stanley broke from them and leaped ashore, where he was soon\r\nfollowed by the entire band.  But here new objects--namely, Mrs Stanley\r\nand Edith--attracted their wondering attention.  Approaching towards the\r\nformer, they began timidly to examine her dress, which was indeed very\r\ndifferent from theirs, and calculated to awaken curiosity and surprise.\r\nThe Esquimau women were dressed very much like the men--namely, in long\r\nshirts of sealskin or deerskin with the hair on, short breeches of the\r\nsame material, and long sealskin boots.  The hoods of the women were\r\nlarger than those of the men, and their boots much more capacious; and\r\nwhile the latter had a short stump of a tail or peak hanging from the\r\nhinder part of their shirts, the women wore their tails so long that\r\nthey trailed along the ground as they walked.  In some cases these tails\r\nwere four and six inches broad, with a round flap at the end, and\r\nfringed with ermine.  It was, therefore, with no little surprise that\r\nthey found Mrs Stanley entirely destitute of a tail, and observed that\r\nshe wore her upper garment so long that it reached the ground.  Becoming\r\ngradually more familiar, on seeing that the strange woman permitted them\r\nto handle her pretty freely, one of them gently lifted up her gown to\r\nsee whether or not she wore boots; but receiving a somewhat prompt\r\nrepulse, she began to caress her, and assured her that she did not mean\r\nto give offence.\r\n\r\nBy this time Frank and some of the men had joined the group on the\r\nshore, and as it was getting late Stanley commanded silence.\r\n\r\n\"Tell them I have somewhat to say to them, Oolibuck.\"\r\n\r\nThe interpreter's remark instantly produced a dead silence.\r\n\r\n\"Now ask them if they are glad to hear that we are going to stay to\r\ntrade with them.\"\r\n\r\nA vociferous jabbering followed the question, which, by Oolibuck's\r\ninterpretation, meant that their joy was utterly inexpressible.\r\n\r\n\"Have they been long on the coast?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; they had just arrived, and were on their way up the river to obtain\r\nwood for building their kayaks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did they see the bundle of presents we left for them at the coast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they had seen it; but not knowing whom it was intended for, they\r\nhad not touched it.\"\r\n\r\nOn being told that the presents were intended for them, the poor\r\ncreatures put on a look of intense chagrin, which, however, passed away\r\nwhen it was suggested to them that they might take the gifts on their\r\nreturn to the coast.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Stanley, in conclusion, \"'tis getting late.  Go down to\r\nthe point below the fort and encamp there for the night.  We thank you\r\nfor your visit, and will return it in the morning.  Good-night.\"\r\n\r\nOn this being translated, the Esquimaux gave a general yell of assent\r\nand immediately retired, bounding and shouting and leaping as they went,\r\nlooking, in their gleesome rotundity, like the infant progeny of a race\r\nof giants.\r\n\r\n\"I like the look of these men very much,\" said Stanley, as he walked up\r\nto the house with Frank.  \"Their genuine trustfulness is a fine trait in\r\ntheir character.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt of it,\" replied Frank.  \"There is much truth in the proverb,\r\n`Evil dreaders are evil doers.'  Those who fear no evil intend none.\r\nHad they been Indians, now, we should have had more trouble with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt it not, Frank.  You would have been pleased to witness the\r\nprompt alacrity with which the poor creatures answered to our cry of\r\nChimo, and ran their kayaks fearlessly ashore, although, for all they\r\nknew to the contrary, the rocks might have concealed a hundred enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" said Frank, with an air of perplexity, \"the Esquimau\r\ncharacter seems to me a difficult problem to solve.  When we read the\r\nworks of arctic voyagers, we find that one man's experience of the\r\nEsquimaux proves them to be inveterate thieves and liars, while another\r\nspeaks of them as an honest, truthful people--and that, too, being said\r\nof the same tribe.  Nay, further, I have read of a tribe being all that\r\nis good and amiable at one time, and all that is bad and vile at\r\nanother.  Now the conduct of these good-natured fellows, in reference to\r\nthe bundle of trinkets we left at the mouth of the river, indicates a\r\ndegree of honesty that is almost too sensitive; for the merest exertion\r\nof common-sense would show that a bundle hung up in an exposed place to\r\npublic view must be for the public good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless they seem both honest and friendly,\" returned Stanley,\r\n\"and I trust that our experience of them may never change.  To-morrow I\r\nshall give them some good advice in regard to procuring furs, and show\r\nthem the wealth of our trading store.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the morrow came the visit of the Esquimaux was returned by the\r\nentire force of Fort Chimo, and the childish delight with which they\r\nwere received was most amusing.  The childishness, however, was only\r\napplicable to these natives when expressing their strong feelings.  In\r\nother respects, particularly in their physical actions, they were most\r\nmanly; and the thick black beards and moustaches that clothed the chins\r\nof most of the men seemed very much the reverse of infantine.  The\r\nchildren were so exactly like to their parents in costume that they\r\nseemed miniature representations of them.  In fact, were a child viewed\r\nthrough a magnifying glass it would become a man, and were a man viewed\r\nthrough a diminishing glass he would become a child--always, of course,\r\nexcepting the beard.\r\n\r\nBryan became a special favourite with the natives when it was discovered\r\nthat he was a worker in iron, and the presents with which he was\r\noverwhelmed were of a most extraordinary, and, in some cases, perplexing\r\nnature.  One man, who seemed determined to get into his good graces,\r\noffered him a choice morsel of broiled seal.  \"No, thankee, lad,\" said\r\nBryan; \"I've had my brickfust.\"\r\n\r\nSupposing that the broiling had something to do with the blacksmith's\r\nobjection, the Esquimau hastily cut off a slice of the raw blubber and\r\ntendered it to him.\r\n\r\n\"D'ye think I'm a haythen?\" said Bryan, turning away in disgust.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, try it, Bryan,\" cried La Roche, turning from an Esquimau baby, in\r\nthe contemplation of which he had been absorbed--\"try it; 'tis ver'\r\ngoot, I 'sure you.  Ver' goot for your complaint, Bryan.  But come,\r\nhere, vitement.--Just regardez dat hinfant.  Come here, queek!\"\r\n\r\nThus urged, Bryan broke away from his host (who had just split open the\r\nshinbone of a deer, and offered him the raw marrow, but without\r\nsuccess), and, going towards La Roche, regarded the baby in question.\r\nIt was a remarkably fine child, seemingly about ten months old, with a\r\nround, rosy, oily face, coal-black hair, and large, round, coal-black\r\neyes, with which it returned the stare of the two men with interest.\r\nBut that which amused the visitors most was a lump of fat or blubber,\r\nwith a skewer thrust through it, which its mother had given to the child\r\nto suck, and which it was endeavouring to thrust down its throat with\r\nboth hands.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, Oolibuck; pourquoi is de stick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho, ho, ho!\" laughed Oolibuck.  \"Dat is for keep de chile quiet; and de\r\nstick is for no let him choke; him no can swallow de stick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Musha! but it would stick av he did swallow it,\" said Bryan, turning\r\naway with a laugh.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day Stanley and Frank conducted the natives to the\r\nfort, and having given them all an excellent dinner and a few gifts of\r\nneedles, scissors, and knives, led them to the store, where the goods\r\nfor trade were ranged temptingly on shelves round the walls.  A counter\r\nencompassed a space around the entrance-door, within which the natives\r\nstood and gazed on wealth which, to their unsophisticated minds, seemed\r\na dream of enchantment.\r\n\r\nHaving given them time to imbibe a conception of the room and its\r\ntreasures, Stanley addressed them through the interpreter; but as\r\nreference to this worthy individual is somewhat hampering, we will\r\ndiscard him forthwith--retaining his style and language, however, for\r\nthe benefit of his fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\n\"Now, you see what useful things I have got here for you; but I cannot\r\ngive them to you for nothing.  They cost us much, and give us much\r\ntrouble to bring them here.  But I will give them for skins and furs and\r\noil, and the tusks of the walrus; and when you go to your friends on the\r\nsea-coast, you can tell them to bring skins with them when they come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye vill do vat you vish.  Ye most happy you come.  Ye vill hunt very\r\nmush, and make your house empty of all dese t'ings if ye can.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's well.  And now I am in need of boots for my men, and you have a\r\ngood many, I see; so, if you can spare some of these, we will begin to\r\ntrade at once.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, the natives dispatched several of their number down to\r\nthe camp, who soon returned laden with boots.  These boots are most\r\nuseful articles.  They are neatly made of sealskin, the feet or soles\r\nbeing of walrus hide, and perfectly waterproof.  They are invaluable to\r\nthose who have to walk much in ice-cold water or among moist snow, as is\r\nthe case in those regions during spring and autumn.  In winter the frost\r\ncompletely does away with all moisture, so that the Indian moccasin is\r\nbetter at that season than the Esquimau boot.\r\n\r\nFor these boots, and a few articles of native clothing, Stanley paid the\r\nnatives at the rates of the regular tariff throughout the country; and\r\nthis rate was so much beyond the poor Esquimau estimate of the relative\r\nvalue of boots and goods, that they would gladly have given all the\r\nboots and coats they possessed for what they received as the value of\r\none pair.\r\n\r\nOverjoyed at their good fortune, and laden with treasure, they returned\r\nto their camp to feast, and to sing the praises of the _Kublunat_, as\r\nthey termed the fur-traders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nSILENT CONVERSATION--RAW FOOD--FEMALE TAILS--A TERRIBLE BATTLE\r\nTERMINATED BY THE INTERPOSITION OF A GIANT.\r\n\r\nOf all the people at Fort Chimo no one was more interested in the\r\nEsquimaux than little Edith.  She not only went fearlessly among them,\r\nand bestowed upon them every trinket she possessed, but, in her\r\nchildlike desire for the companionship and sympathy of human beings of\r\nher own age and sex, she took forcible possession of two little girls\r\nwho happened to be cleaner, and, therefore, prettier than the others,\r\nand led them away to her own ravine, where she introduced them to her\r\nfavourite berries and to her dog Chimo.  At first the dog did not seem\r\nto relish the intrusion of these new favourites, but seeing that they\r\ndid not induce his mistress to caress him less than before, he\r\nconsiderately tolerated them.  Besides, the Esquimaux had brought their\r\ndogs along with them; and Chimo, being of an amicable disposition, had\r\nentered into social fellowship with his own kind.  We have said that\r\nChimo was sagacious, and it is quite possible he may have felt the\r\npropriety of granting to Edith that liberty which he undoubtedly claimed\r\nfor himself.\r\n\r\nBut Edith's intercourse with her little Esquimau _protegees_ was\r\nnecessarily confined to looks--the language of the eye making up for the\r\nabsence of that of the tongue.  There were many things, however, in\r\nwhich language was not required as a medium of communication between the\r\nchildren.  When the berries were good, the brightening eyes and smacking\r\nlips spoke a language common to all the human race.  So, also, when the\r\nberries were sour or bitter, the expression of their faces was\r\npeculiarly emphatic.  The joyous shout, too, as they discovered a new\r\nscene that pleased their eyes, while they roved hand in hand through the\r\nravines, or the shrinking glance of fear as they found themselves\r\nunexpectedly on the edge of a precipice, was sufficiently intelligible\r\nto the trio.  The little friends presented a striking and grotesque\r\ncontrast.  It would have been difficult to say whether the little\r\nEsquimaux were boys or girls.  If anything, the costume seemed more to\r\nindicate the former than the latter.  Like their mothers, they wore\r\nloose deerskin shirts with the hair on the outside, which gave them a\r\nround, soft, burly appearance--an appearance which was increased by\r\ntheir little boots, which were outrageously wide, and quite as long as\r\ntheir legs.  The frocks or shirts had hoods and tails, which latter,\r\naccording to fashion, were so long that they trailed on the ground.  The\r\ninconvenience of the tail is so great that the women, while travelling\r\non a journey, get rid of it by drawing it between their legs, and,\r\nlifting up the end, fastening it in front to a button sewed to their\r\nfrock for the purpose.  In travelling, therefore, Esquimau women seem to\r\nbe destitute of this appendage; but, on arriving at camp, they undo the\r\nfastening, and walk about with flowing tails behind them!\r\n\r\nEdith's costume consisted of a short frock made of dark blue cloth, and\r\na head-dress peculiar to the Indian women among the Crees.  It was\r\npreferred by the little wearer to all other styles of bonnet, on account\r\nof the ease with which it could be thrown off and on.  She also wore\r\nornamented leggings and moccasins.  Altogether, with her graceful\r\nfigure, flaxen curls, and picturesque costume, she presented a strong\r\ncontrast to the fat, dark, hairy little creatures who followed her by\r\nbrook and bush and precipice the livelong day.\r\n\r\nOne morning, about two weeks after the arrival of the Esquimaux, Edith\r\nwent down to the camp after breakfast, and found her two companions\r\nengaged in concluding their morning meal.  The elder, whose name was\r\nArnalooa, was peering with earnest scrutiny into the depths of a\r\nmarrowbone, from which she had already extracted a large proportion of\r\nthe raw material.  The younger, Okatook, seized a lump of raw seal's\r\nflesh, as Edith entered their hut, and, cutting therefrom a savoury\r\nmorsel, put it into her mouth as she rose to welcome her visitor.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! how _can_ you?\" said Edith, with a look of disgust at this ravenous\r\nconduct on the part of her friend.  But Edith had said, \"Oh! how _can_\r\nyou?\" and \"Oh! shocking!\" and \"Oh! why don't you give up eating it raw?\"\r\nand \"Oh! why _won't_ you have it cooked?\" nearly every day for the last\r\ntwo weeks, without producing any other effect than a gleeful laugh from\r\nthe little Esquimaux; for, although they did not comprehend her words,\r\nthey clearly understood her looks of disapproval.  But although they\r\nwould not give up the habit of eating raw flesh, which they had been\r\naccustomed to from their infancy, they were prevailed on so far to break\r\nthrough the habits of their people as to wash their hands and faces\r\nbefore going out to play.  This they did because Edith positively\r\nrefused to go with them unless they did so.\r\n\r\nLifting up the end of her tail and wiping her mouth therewith, Arnalooa\r\nsmiled at Edith's look of reproach, and ran laughing towards the shore,\r\nwhere she and Okatook washed their hands, after which they followed\r\nEdith and Chimo to their favourite ravine.  Although she knew that they\r\ndid not understand a word of what she said, Edith invariably kept up a\r\nrunning fire of small talk, in reference chiefly to the objects of\r\nnature by which they were surrounded.  To this the little hairy\r\ncreatures listened intently with smiling faces, and sometimes they\r\nlaughed prodigiously, as though they understood what was said, so that\r\ntheir companion felt as if she were really conversing with them,\r\nalthough she was sadly perplexed at the utter impossibility of obtaining\r\nan intelligible reply to a question when she chanced to put one.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what a lovely glen!\" cried Edith, her eyes beaming with delight,\r\nas, on turning the point of a projecting crag, she and her companions\r\nfound themselves in a spot which they had not before seen during their\r\nrambles.  It was a wild, savage gorge, full of fallen rocks, hemmed in\r\nwith high cliffs, fringed here and there with willows and mosses, among\r\nwhich were a few brilliant wild-flowers.  The lights and shadows of the\r\nspot were thrown into powerful contrast by a gleam of sunshine which\r\nflashed down among the rugged masses, lighting up peaks and sharp edges\r\nin some spots, while in others they were thrown into the profoundest\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! is it not a delightful place?\" cried Edith, as she bounded up the\r\nrugged path, followed by Chimo, while the two Esquimau girls buttoned up\r\ntheir tails, and followed her as fast as their more cumbrous habiliments\r\nwould permit.\r\n\r\nFor a quarter of an hour the party toiled up the steep ascent, pausing\r\nnow and then to pluck a flower, or to look back on the wild path by\r\nwhich they had come, until they reached a ridge of rock, beyond which\r\nlay a small lake or pool.  So dark and still did it lie within the\r\nshadow of the overhanging cliffs that it resembled a pool of ink.  Here\r\nthe adventurous explorers sat down to recover breath, and to gaze in\r\nchildish delight, not unmixed with awe, at the wild scene around them.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar wildness of the spot seemed to exercise an unusual\r\ninfluence over the dog; for, instead of lying down, as it was wont to\r\ndo, at the feet of its young mistress, it moved about uneasily, and once\r\nor twice uttered a low growl.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, Chimo,\" said Edith, when these symptoms of restlessness had\r\nattracted her attention; \"what is the matter with you, my dear dog?\r\nSurely you are not frightened at the appearance of this wild place!\r\nSpeak, dog; see, Arnalooa is laughing at you.\"\r\n\r\nEdith might have said with more propriety that Arnalooa was laughing at\r\nherself, for the little Esquimau was much amused at the serious manner\r\nin which her Kublunat friend spoke to her dog.  But Chimo refused to be\r\ncomforted.  He raised his snout, snuffed the air once or twice, and\r\nthen, descending the gorge a short distance, put his nose close to the\r\nground and trotted away.\r\n\r\n\"That is very odd of Chimo,\" said Edith, looking into Arnalooa's face\r\nwith an expression of perplexity.\r\n\r\nAs she spoke Okatook pointed, with an eager glance, up the ravine.\r\nTurning her eyes hastily in the direction indicated, Edith beheld a deer\r\nbounding towards them.  It was closely followed by a savage wolf.  The\r\ndeer seemed to be in the last stage of exhaustion.  Its flanks were wet\r\nwith moisture, its eyes starting from their sockets, and its breath\r\nissued forth in deep sobs, as it bounded onwards, seemingly more by the\r\nforce of its impetus than by any voluntary exertion.  More intent on the\r\ndanger behind than on that which lay before it, the deer made straight\r\nfor the pass in which the three girls stood, and scarcely had they time\r\nto spring to the sides of the cliff, when it swept by like an arrow.\r\nInstantly after, and ere it had taken two bounds past them, the wolf\r\nsprang forward; caught it by the throat, and dragged it to the ground,\r\nwhere in a few seconds it worried the noble animal to death.  It is\r\nprobable that the chase now terminated had begun at early dawn that day,\r\nfor deer being fleeter than wolves they prolong the chase until overcome\r\nby the superior strength and dogged perseverance of their ravenous\r\nenemies.  Over mountain and hill they had bounded along together,\r\nthrough glen and gorge, across river and lake, bursting headlong through\r\nbush and brake, or under the shadow of frowning cliffs, and toiling, at\r\na foot pace and with panting sides, up the steep hills, in the fierce\r\nblaze of the sun, the one impelled by hunger, the other by fear, until\r\nat length the scene closed in the wild pass, almost at the feet of the\r\nthree children.\r\n\r\nBut retribution was in store for the savage destroyer.  Ere yet the\r\nlife's blood had teased to flow from the throat of the dying deer, and\r\nwhile the wolf's fangs were still dripping with its gore, a fierce bark,\r\nfollowed by a terrific growl, rang among the cliffs, and Chimo, with his\r\nears laid back and his formidable row of teeth exposed, rushed up the\r\ngorge and seized the wolf by the neck!  Thus assailed, the wolf returned\r\nthe bite with interest, and immediately a fight of the most energetic\r\ncharacter ensued.\r\n\r\nThe wolf was much larger and more powerful than Chimo, but was greatly\r\nexhausted by its long chase, while the dog was fresh and vigorous.  Once\r\nor twice Chimo tossed his huge adversary by main strength, but as often\r\nhe was overturned and dreadfully shaken, while the long fangs of the\r\nwolf met in his neck, and mingled the blood of the deer, which\r\nbespattered his black muzzle, with the life's blood that began to flow\r\ncopiously from Chimo's veins.  At this moment a shout was heard farther\r\nup the ravine.  The three girls turned hastily, and saw, on a point of\r\nrock which projected from the mountain side and overhung the dark pool,\r\nthe figure of a man, of such immense proportions that they instinctively\r\nshrank back with terror.  The position in which he stood made him appear\r\nlarger than he really was.  The scattered gleams and slant rays of\r\nsunshine that played around the spot invested him as with a supernatural\r\nhalo, while a bright glow of light on the cliff behind detached him\r\nprominently from the surrounding shadows.  He poised a spear in his\r\nright hand, and, while Edith gazed at him in terror, the weapon flew\r\nwhistling through the air and was buried in the side of the wolf.  But\r\nso close did the spear pass, that Edith involuntarily stepped back as\r\nshe heard it whiz.  In doing so she lost her balance and fell over the\r\ncliff.  Fortunately, Arnalooa caught her by the dress and partially\r\nbroke her fall, but the descent was sufficiently steep and rugged to\r\nrender the child insensible.\r\n\r\nWhen Edith recovered consciousness, her first emotion was that of\r\nterror, on beholding a large, dark-bearded face bending over her; but a\r\nsecond glance showed her that the eyes of the stranger gazed upon her\r\nwith a look of tenderness, and that Arnalooa and Okatook were kneeling\r\nbeside her with an expression of anxiety.  Had anything further been\r\nwanting to allay her fears, the sight of Chimo would have done it.  It\r\nis true the sturdy dog panted heavily, and occasionally licked his\r\nwounds, as he sat on his haunches at her feet; but he was wonderfully\r\ncalm and collected after his recent mortal conflict, and regarded his\r\nyoung mistress from time to time with an air of patronising assurance.\r\n\r\nAs Edith opened her eyes, the stranger muttered some unintelligible\r\nwords, and, rising hastily, went to a neighbouring spring, at which he\r\nfilled a rude cup with water.  In doing this, he revealed the huge\r\nproportions of the gigantic Esquimau whom we introduced to our reader in\r\na former chapter.  He was dressed in the same manner as when we first\r\nsaw him, but his face was somewhat altered, and his black eyebrows were\r\nmarked by that peculiar curve which is expressive of deep melancholy.\r\nReturning quickly from the spring, he kneeled beside the little girl,\r\nand, raising her head on his broad hand, held the goblet to her lips.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Edith faintly, as she swallowed a few drops; \"I think\r\nI had better go home.  Is Chimo safe?  Chimo!\"  She started up as the\r\nrecollection of the fight with the wolf flashed upon her; but the fall\r\nhad stunned her rather severely, and scarcely had she risen to her feet\r\nwhen she staggered and fell back into the arms of the Esquimau.\r\n\r\nSeeing that she was quite unable to walk, he raised her in his powerful\r\narm as if she had been a young lamb.  Catching the dead wolf by the neck\r\nas he passed, and springing from rock to rock with catlike agility, he\r\nbore his burden down the ravine, and strode towards the fort under the\r\nguidance of Okatook and Arnalooa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nMAXIMUS--DEER SPEARING--A SURPRISINGLY BAD SHOT--CHARACTER OF THE\r\nNATIVES.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! what have we here?\" exclaimed Stanley, starting from his seat in\r\namazement, as the giant entered the hall of Fort Chimo--his left hand\r\ngrasping a blood-stained wolf by the throat, and Edith resting in his\r\nright arm.\r\n\r\nAt first the startled father imagined his child must have been wounded,\r\nif not killed, by the savage animal; but his mind was immediately\r\nrelieved on this point by Edith herself, who was no sooner laid on her\r\nbed than she recovered sufficiently to narrate the circumstances\r\nattending her fall.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Maximus,\" said Stanley, returning to the hall and applying to the\r\nbulky savage the term that seemed most appropriate to him, \"shake hands\r\nwith me, my good fellow.  You've saved Chimo's life, it seems; and\r\nthat's a good turn I'll not forget.  But a--.  I see you don't\r\nunderstand a word I say.  Hallo!  Moses, Moses! you deaf rascal, come\r\nhere!\" he shouted, as that worthy passed the window.\r\n\r\n\"Yis, mossue,\" said Moses, entering the hall.  \"Oh, me! what a walrus am\r\ndis!  Me do b'lieve him most high as a tree an' more broader nor\r\niveryt'ing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold thy tongue, Moses, and ask the fellow where he came from; but tell\r\nhim first that I'm obliged to him for saving Chimo from that villainous\r\nwolf.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Moses interpreted, Arnalooa and Okatook, being privileged members\r\nof the tribe, crossed over to Edith's room.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what says he?\" inquired Stanley, at the end of a long address\r\nwhich the giant had delivered to Moses.\r\n\r\n\"Him say he heered we have come to trade, from Eskeemo to west'ard, and\r\nso him come for to see us.\"\r\n\r\n\"A most excellent reason,\" said Stanley.  \"Has he brought any furs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis; him brought one two fox, and two t'ree deer.  No have much furs in\r\ndis country, him say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to hear that.  Perhaps his opinion may change when he sees the\r\ninside of our store.  But I would like him to stay about the fort as a\r\nhunter, Moses; he seems a first-rate man.  Ask him if he will consent to\r\nstay for a time.\"\r\n\r\n\"P'raps he fuss-rate, p'raps not,\" muttered Moses in a disparaging tone,\r\nas he turned to put the question.\r\n\r\n\"Him say yis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good; then take him to your house, Moses, and give him some food\r\nand a pipe, and teach him English as fast as you can, and see that it is\r\ngrammatical.  D'ye hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, mossue, me quite sure for to teach him dat.\"\r\n\r\nAs Moses turned to quit the hall, Stanley called him back.  \"Ask\r\nMaximus, by-the-bye, if he knows anything of a party of Esquimaux who\r\nseem to have been attacked, not long ago, by Indians in this\r\nneighbourhood.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner was this question put than the face of Maximus, which had worn\r\na placid, smiling expression during the foregoing conversation, totally\r\nchanged.  His brows lowered, and his lips were tightly compressed, as he\r\nregarded Stanley for a few moments ere he ventured to reply.  Then, in a\r\ndeep, earnest tone, he related the attack, the slaughter of his people,\r\ntheir subsequent escape, and the loss of his bride.  Even Moses was\r\nagitated as he went on, and showed his teeth like an enraged mastiff\r\nwhen the Esquimau came to speak of his irreparable loss.\r\n\r\n\"Stay one moment,\" said Stanley, when Maximus concluded.  \"I have\r\nsomething to show you;\" and hastening into his room, he quickly returned\r\nwith the little piece of sealskin that had been found at the deserted\r\nIndian camp.  \"Do you know anything of this, Maximus?  Do you understand\r\nthese marks?\"\r\n\r\nThe Esquimau uttered a cry of surprise when his eye fell on the piece of\r\nskin, and he seemed much agitated while he put several quick, earnest\r\nquestions to Moses, who replied as earnestly and quickly; then turning\r\nrapidly on his heel, he sprang through the doorway, and was soon lost to\r\nview in the stunted woods of the ravine above the fort.\r\n\r\n\"That fellow seems in a hurry,\" exclaimed Frank Morton, entering the\r\nroom just as the savage made his exit.  \"Who is he, and wherefore in so\r\ngreat haste?\"\r\n\r\n\"As to who he is,\" answered Stanley, \"I'll tell you that after Moses has\r\nexplained the cause of his sudden flight.\"\r\n\r\n\"He say that him's wife make dat skin, and de arrow on him skin show dat\r\nde Injuns take her to deir tents.\"\r\n\r\n\"But did you not tell him that we found the skin long ago, and that the\r\nIndians must be far, far away by this time--nobody knows where?\"\r\ndemanded Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Yis, me tell him.  But he go for to see de spot.  T'ink him find more\r\nt'ings, p'raps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, messieurs, voila!\" shouted La Roche, pointing towards the river, as\r\nhe rushed, breathless with haste, into the hall; \"les Esquimaux, dem\r\nkill all de deer dans le kontry.  Oui, voila! dans les kayak.  Two dozen\r\nat vonce--vraiment!\"  Without waiting a reply, the excited Frenchman\r\nturned round and rushed out of the house, followed by Stanley and Frank,\r\nwho seized their guns, which always hung ready loaded on the walls of\r\nthe apartment.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the water's edge, the scene that met their eye was indeed\r\nsufficient to account for the excitement of La Roche.  A herd of perhaps\r\nfifty or sixty deer, on their way to the coast, and ignorant of the foes\r\nwho had so recently invaded their solitudes, had descended the ravine\r\nopposite the fort, with the intention of crossing the river.  The\r\nEsquimaux had perceived this, and keeping themselves and their kayaks\r\nconcealed until most of the animals were in the water, and the leaders\r\nof the herd more than two-thirds over, they then gave chase, and getting\r\nbetween the deer and the opposite shore, cut off their retreat, and\r\ndrove them towards their encampment.\r\n\r\nHere the slaughter commenced, and Stanley and Frank arrived at the scene\r\nof action while they were in the midst of the wholesale destruction.  In\r\nall directions the kayaks, with their solitary occupants, were darting\r\nabout hither and thither like arrows in the midst of the affrighted\r\nanimals; none of which, however, were speared until they were driven\r\nquite close to the shore.  In their terror, the deer endeavoured to\r\nescape by swimming in different directions; but the long double-bladed\r\npaddles of the Esquimaux sent the light kayaks after them like\r\nlightning, and a sharp prick on their flanks turned them in the right\r\ndirection.  There were so many deer, however, that a few succeeded in\r\ngaining the land; but here the guns of the traders awaited them.  In the\r\nmidst of this wild scene, Frank's attention was arrested by the cool\r\nproceedings of an Esquimau, whose name was Chacooto.  He had several\r\ntimes exhibited a degree of shrewdness beyond his fellows during his\r\nresidence near the fort, and was evidently a man of importance in the\r\ntribe.  Chacooto had collected together a band of the herd, amounting to\r\nfifteen, and, by dint of cool decision and quick movements, had driven\r\nthem to within a few yards of the shore, exactly opposite the spot\r\nwhereon his tent stood.  One young buck, of about two years old, darted\r\naway from the rest more than once, but, with a sweep of the paddle and a\r\nprick of the lance, Chacooto turned it back again, while a quiet\r\nsarcastic smile played on his countenance.  Having driven the herd close\r\nenough in for his purpose, the Esquimau ended the career of the\r\nrefractory buck with a single thrust of his lance, and then proceeded\r\ncoolly to stab them all one after another.\r\n\r\n\"Och, the spalpeen!\" said a voice at Frank's ear.  \"'Tis himsilf knows\r\nhow to do it, an' no mistake.  Musha! his lance goes out and in like a\r\nthailor's needle; an' he niver strikes more nor wance, the haythen!\"\r\n\r\n\"He certainly does know how to do it, Bryan,\" replied Frank; \"and it's a\r\ncomfort to know that every thrust kills in a moment.  I like to see as\r\nlittle of the appearance of cruelty as possible in work of this kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrah! there's wan that'll chate 'im, anyhow,\" cried Bryan, throwing\r\nforward his gun in nervous haste, as one of the deer gained the land,\r\ndespite Chacooto's rapidity, and bounded towards the hills.\r\n\r\nFrank smiled at the eager haste of his companion, who was one of the\r\npoor shots of the party, and, consequently, always in a hurry.  \"Now,\r\nBryan, there's a chance.  Take your time.  Just behind the shoulder; a\r\nlittle low, for that gun kicks horribly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Murder and blazes, she won't go off!\" cried the exasperated Irishman,\r\nas, after a wavering effort to take aim, he essayed unsuccessfully to\r\npull the trigger.\r\n\r\n\"Half-cock, man!  Cock it!\" said Frank quickly.\r\n\r\n\"So 'tis, be the mortial!  Och, Bryan, yer too cliver, ye are!\" he\r\nexclaimed, rectifying his error with a force that nearly tore off the\r\ndog-head.  At that instant there was a sharp crack, and the deer,\r\nbounding into the air, fell dead on the sand at the edge of the willows.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, Bryan,\" said Massan, chuckling and reloading his piece as\r\nhe walked up to his comrade.  \"I would not ha' taken't out o' yer teeth,\r\nlad, if ye had been ready; but one bound more would ha' put the beast\r\nbeyond the reach o' a bullet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Faix, Massan, ye desarve to be hanged for murther.  Shure I was waitin'\r\ntill the poor crayture got into the bushes, to give it a chance o' its\r\nlife, before I fired.  That's the way that gintlemen from the ould\r\ncountry does when we're out sportin'.  We always put up the birds first,\r\nand fire afterwards; but you salvages murther a poor brute on the sand,\r\nwhin it's only two fathoms from ye.  Shame on ye, Massan.\"\r\n\r\n\"See, Massan,\" cried Frank, pointing to another deer, which, having\r\nescaped its pursuers, had gained the heights above.  \"That fellow is\r\nbeyond us both, I fear.  Be ready when it comes into view beyond the\r\ncliff there.\"\r\n\r\nBut Massan did not move; and when Frank threw forward his gun, he felt\r\nhis arm arrested.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, monsieur,\" said Massan respectfully; \"there's a sure bullet\r\nabout to start for that deer.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he pointed to Dick Prince, who, ignorant of the fact that\r\nthe deer had been seen by Frank, was watching its reappearance from\r\nbehind a neighbouring rock, at some distance from where they stood.  In\r\na second it came into view--the bullet sped--and the deer bounded\r\nlightly into the bushes, evidently unhurt!\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say whether Dick Prince or his comrades exhibited\r\nmost amazement in their looks at this result.  That the crack shot of\r\nthe party--the man who could hit a button in the centre at a hundred\r\nyards, and cut the head off a partridge at a hundred and fifty--should\r\nmiss a deer at ninety yards, was utterly incomprehensible.\r\n\r\n\"Is it yer own gun ye've got?\" inquired Bryan, as the discomfited\r\nmarksman walked up.\r\n\r\n\"No; it's yours,\" replied Prince.\r\n\r\nA smile, which resolved itself into a myriad of wrinkles, flitted over\r\nthe blacksmith's face as he said--\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Prince! ye'll requare long practice to come to the parfect use o'\r\nthat wipon.  I've always fired three yards, at laste, to the left, iver\r\nsince we fell over the hill togither.  If it's a very long shot, it\r\nrequares four to take the baste in the flank, or four an' a half if ye\r\nwant to hit the shoulder, besides an allowance o' two feet above its\r\nhead, to make up for the twist I gave it the other day in the forge, in\r\ntryin' to put it right!\"\r\n\r\nThis explanation was satisfactory to all parties, especially so to\r\nPrince, who felt that his credit was saved; and if Prince had a weakness\r\nat all, it was upon this point.\r\n\r\nThe deer were now all killed, with the exception of those of the band\r\nthat had been last in entering the river.  These, with a few stragglers,\r\nhad returned to the shore from which they started.  The remainder of the\r\nevening was devoted to skinning and cutting up the carcasses--an\r\noperation requiring considerable time, skill, and labour.\r\n\r\nWhile the people at the fort were thus employed, Maximus (who adopted at\r\nonce the name given to him by Stanley) returned from his fruitless\r\njourney to the Indian camp, and assisted the men at their work.  He made\r\nno allusion whatever to his visit to the deserted Indian camp; but, from\r\nthe settled expression of deep sadness that clouded his countenance, it\r\nwas inferred that what he had seen there had not tended to raise his\r\nhopes.\r\n\r\nThe supply of deer obtained at this time was very seasonable, for the\r\nfrost had now begun to set in so steadily that the meat could be hung up\r\nto freeze, and thus be kept fresh for winter's consumption.  Some of it,\r\nhowever, was dried and stored away in bales; while a small quantity was\r\npounded after being dried, made into pemmican, and reserved for future\r\njourneys.\r\n\r\nAs for the Esquimaux, they gave themselves up, during the first night,\r\nto feasting and rejoicing.  During the short time that they had been at\r\nthe fort, they had converted the promontory on which they were encamped\r\ninto a scene of the utmost confusion and filth.  A regard for truth\r\nconstrains us to say, that although these poor creatures turned out to\r\nbe honest, and simple, and kind-hearted, they did not by any means turn\r\nout to be cleanly; quite the reverse.\r\n\r\nThey had erected four summer tents on the beach, which were composed of\r\nskins sewed together, and supported on poles in such a way as to afford\r\nample room for the accommodation of their families.  The entrance to\r\neach tent was through a passage, which was also made of skins, hung over\r\na line fastened to a pole at the distance of twelve or fifteen feet from\r\nthe tent.  Each side of this entrance was lined with piles of\r\nprovisions--seals, fish, ducks, and venison, in various stages of decay,\r\nwhich rendered the passage into the interior a trying operation.  True,\r\nit was intended that the frost should prevent this decay; but,\r\nunfortunately, the frost did not always do its duty.  The manner in\r\nwhich they cut up their deer and prepared them for future use was\r\ncurious.  After cutting the animals into two, without skinning them,\r\nthey pinned up the front half with the heart and liver in the cavity.\r\nThe other half they treated in a similar way, minus the heart and liver,\r\nand then put them out to freeze until required.  When frozen, they were\r\nfrequently used in their tents as seats, until the gradual diminution of\r\nthe larder demanded that they should be appropriated to their proper\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe tribe of Esquimaux who resided near Fort Chimo at this time were\r\npossessed of an enormous stone kettle, in which they boiled an entire\r\ndeer at one time; and while the good people luxuriated on the flesh of\r\nthe animal in their tents, the dogs assembled round the boiler to await\r\nthe cooling of the soup--thus verifying the assertion formerly made by\r\nMassan on that head.\r\n\r\nThe dogs resembled those of the Newfoundland breed in some respects, but\r\nwere scarcely so large or good-looking, and had erect instead of pendent\r\nears.  There were about a dozen of them; and it was wonderful to observe\r\nthe patience with which they sat in a circle round the kettle, gazing\r\nearnestly at the soup, licking their chaps the while, in anticipation of\r\nthe feast.\r\n\r\nThe successful hunt was regarded as worthy of being specially celebrated\r\nby the distribution of a glass of grog to the men, and also to the\r\nEsquimaux; for at the time we write of, the Hudson's Bay Company had not\r\nyet instituted the wise and humane regulation which has since become a\r\nstanding order throughout all parts of the country, except where there\r\nis opposition--namely, that ardent spirits shall not be given to the\r\nnatives.  However, Stanley's natural disposition led him to be very\r\ncircumspect in giving spirits to the men and natives, and the supply now\r\nissued was very small.\r\n\r\nIn the men it produced a desire for the violin, and created a tendency\r\nto sing and tell stories.  In the Esquimaux it produced at first\r\ndislike, and afterwards wild excitement, which, in the case of Chacooto,\r\nended in a desire to fight.  But his comrades, assisted by his wives,\r\noverpowered him, tied him in a sack made of sealskin, and left him to\r\nroar and kick till he fell asleep!\r\n\r\nThe honesty of these natives was exhibited very strikingly in all their\r\ndealings with the fur-traders.  Although iron tools of every description\r\nwere scattered about the fort, while the men were engaged in erecting\r\nthe several buildings, not one was missed; and even the useless nails\r\nand scraps of metal that were thrown away, when they were found by\r\nchance by the Esquimaux, were always brought to the house, and the\r\nquestion asked, \"Were they of any use?\" before being appropriated.  They\r\nwere great beggars, however; which was not surprising, considering the\r\nvalue of the articles possessed by the traders, and their own limited\r\nmeans of purchasing them.  Their chief wealth at this time lay in boots\r\nand deerskins, which the women were constantly employed in preparing;\r\nbut Stanley urged them to go into the interior and hunt, as, although\r\ndeerskins and boots were useful, furs were infinitely more valuable.\r\nBut the Esquimaux had much too lively a dread of the Indians to venture\r\naway from the coast, and seemed inclined to hang about the place in\r\ncomparative idleness much longer than was desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nMORE ARRIVALS--HONESTY--INDIANS COME UPON THE SCENE--THE TRIBES\r\nRECONCILED--DISEASE AND DEATH CHANGE THE ASPECT OF THINGS--PHILOSOPHIC\r\nDISCOURSE.\r\n\r\nA day or two after the successful deer-hunt above related, several bands\r\nof Esquimaux arrived at Fort Chimo, and encamped beside their comrades.\r\nThis unusual influx of visitors soon exhausted the venison that had been\r\nprocured; but hunting parties were constantly on the alert, and as game\r\nof all kinds was plentiful, they lived in the midst of abundance.  To\r\nall of these Stanley made small presents of beads and tobacco, and\r\nrecommended them strongly to go and hunt for furs.  But they seemed to\r\nlike their quarters, and refused to move.  The new arrivals, along with\r\nthose who had first come, formed a band of about three hundred, and were\r\nfound, almost without exception, to be a quiet, inoffensive, and honest\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAs a proof of this latter quality, we may mention a circumstance that\r\noccurred a few days after the arrival of the last band.  Being desirous\r\nof taking some additional soundings, Stanley launched his boat by the\r\nhelp of the Esquimaux, for his own men were all absent hunting and\r\nfishing.  The boat referred to had been sent to the fort in the ship,\r\nand was a most useful and acceptable gift from the Governor of the Fur\r\nCompany to the gentleman in charge of Ungava.  Stanley hoisted his\r\nsails, and prepared to run down the river; but ere he had advanced a\r\nhundred yards, he was startled by a burst of loud cries from the shore,\r\nand, looking back, he observed the whole band of natives pouring like a\r\ntorrent into the fort!  His heart leaped within him as he thought of his\r\nunprotected wife and child.  Turning the boat towards the shore, he ran\r\nit on the beach, and, leaving it with all the sails standing, he rushed\r\ninto the square of the fort, forcing his way through the crush of\r\nnatives, whose vociferous talking rendered what they said, for a time,\r\nunintelligible.  At length Moses forced his way through the crowd,\r\nfollowed by one of the natives, who led a large dog by a line fastened\r\nround its neck.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Moses? what's wrong?\" cried Stanley.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not'ing at all,\" replied Moses, casting a look of pity at his\r\ncountrymen.  \"Dem are great gooses.  Die man here wid de dog, him say\r\ndat de child'n was play in de square of dis fort, an' one o' dem trow\r\nstone and broke a window.  It was de son ob dis man what do it, an' him\r\nsay he most awful sorry--an' all de people sorry, so dey bring de dog to\r\npay for de broken window.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad it's nothing worse,\" cried Stanley, much relieved.  \"Tell them\r\nI'm happy to find they are sorry, and I hope they will keep the children\r\nout of the square in future; but I don't want the dog.  It was an\r\naccident, and not worth making such a noise about.\"\r\n\r\nThe Esquimaux, however, would not agree to look upon this accident as a\r\nlight matter.  They said truly, that glass was not to be got so easily\r\nas the ice-blocks with which they formed windows to their own winter\r\nhouses, so they insisted on the dog being accepted; and at length\r\nStanley gave in, but took care that the native who gave it should not be\r\na loser in consequence of his honesty.  Moreover, Stanley begged of them\r\nto send up several of their best dogs, saying that he would purchase\r\nthem, as he was in want of a team for hauling the winter firewood.\r\n\r\nNext day, while Stanley was engaged in the trading store with a party of\r\nEsquimaux, he was surprised by hearing a volley of musketry fired at the\r\nback of the fort.  Snatching up a loaded gun as he ran hastily out, he\r\nfound that the shots had been fired by a band of Indians as a salute to\r\nthe fort on their arrival.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time that Indians had made their appearance since the\r\narrival of the fur-traders; and their advent at the present time was\r\nmost fortunate, as it afforded Stanley an opportunity of commencing his\r\nnegotiations as peacemaker in the presence of a considerable band of\r\nboth parties.  The Indians, fifteen in number, were all clothed, with\r\nthe exception of their chief, in deerskin hunting shirts, ornamented\r\nmoccasins of the same material, and cloth leggings.  They wore no\r\nhead-dress, but their long, straight, black hair was decorated with\r\nfeathers and small metallic ornaments, among which were several silver\r\nthimbles.  Their powder-horns and shot-pouches were gaily ornamented\r\nwith bead and quill work; and they were all armed with long guns, on\r\nwhich they leaned as they stood silently, in a picturesque group, on the\r\nflat, rocky platform above the spring, which has been more than once\r\nalluded to.\r\n\r\nThis platform overlooked the fort, and was a favourite promenade of the\r\ntraders.  At present it formed a sort of neutral ground, on which the\r\nIndians took their stand.  The red men were overawed by the very\r\nsuperior number of the Esquimaux, and felt that they were safe only so\r\nlong as they stood on the flat rock, which was the only path leading to\r\nthe ravine, through which, if need be, they could easily escape into the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the Indians, unlike his fellows, was dressed in a costume\r\nof the most grotesque and brilliant character, and, certainly, one\r\nwhich, however much it might raise the admiration of his savage\r\ncompanions, did not add to his dignity in the eyes of the traders.  He\r\nwore a long, bright scarlet coat, richly embroidered with gold lace,\r\nwith large cuffs, and gilt buttons; a pair of blue cloth trousers, and a\r\nvest of the same material; a broad worsted sash, and a hat in the form\r\nof the ordinary beaver or silk hat of Europe.  The material, however,\r\nwas very coarse; but this was made up for by the silver, and gilt cords,\r\nand tassels with which it was profusely decorated.  He evidently felt\r\nhis own importance, and stood with a calm, dignified gaze, waiting to be\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\nHailing Ma-istequan, who leaned on the axe with which he had been\r\ncutting firewood when the volley of the Indians arrested him, Stanley\r\nbade him invite them to enter the fort.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot come down,\" replied the chief, after Ma-istequan had given\r\nthe invitation.  \"The Eskimos are in numbers like the stars; we are few.\r\nIf the pale-faces are our friends, let them come up here and take us by\r\nthe hand and bring us down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very reasonable,\" said Stanley to Frank, who stood beside him; \"we must\r\ntake care that the Esquimaux do not take advantage of their numbers to\r\navenge their ancient wrongs.\"\r\n\r\nThen, turning to the natives, who had now crowded in large numbers into\r\nthe fort, Stanley addressed them in a serious tone; told them that the\r\ntime had now come when he hoped to reconcile the Innuit and the Allat\r\n[Esquimau name for Indians] together; and that he expected they would\r\nshow their gratitude for his many kindnesses to them by treating the\r\nIndians, who were his friends, with hospitality.  The Esquimaux promised\r\nobedience, after which Stanley ascended to the promenade, and taking the\r\nIndian chief by the hand, led him towards the fort, followed by the\r\nwhole band in single file.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to detail the speeches that followed on both sides\r\non this occasion, and the eloquence that was expended that evening in\r\nthe cause of peace.  Suffice it to say that the Indians and Esquimaux\r\nshook hands and exchanged gifts in the presence of the assembled\r\ngarrison of Fort Chimo.  But although the traders had reason to\r\ncongratulate themselves on having so far succeeded in the establishment\r\nof peace, they could not conceal from themselves the fact that while, on\r\nthe one hand, the Esquimaux appeared to be perfectly sincere and cordial\r\nin their professions, on the other hand the Indians evinced a good deal\r\nof taciturnity at first, and even after their reserve was overcome,\r\nseemed to act as men do who are constrained to the performance of a\r\ndistasteful action.\r\n\r\nIn general character, the Indians of Labrador do not contrast well with\r\nthe Esquimaux--at least this may with truth be said of those who\r\nafterwards became attached to the district of Ungava.  The Indian is\r\nreserved and taciturn, while the Esquimau is candid, frank, and\r\ncommunicative.  Of course there are exceptions on both sides.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the same day, Stanley had much difficulty in\r\novercoming the reserve of the Indians, so as to procure information\r\nregarding the interior; and it was not until their hearts were opened by\r\nthe influence of tobacco, that they condescended to give the required\r\ninformation.  This was to the effect that there were not many\r\nfur-bearing animals in the immediate vicinity of Ungava, but that there\r\nwere a good many in the wooded country lying to the southward and\r\neastward.  Here, however, the Indians do not care to hunt, preferring\r\nrather to keep to the heights of land, and near the coast, where the\r\ndeer are numerous.  In fact, Stanley afterwards found that the facility\r\nwith which the Indians procured deer in this part of the country was a\r\nserious drawback to the fur trade, as they contented themselves with\r\ntrapping just enough of otters, foxes, etcetera, to enable them to\r\nprocure a supply of ammunition with which to hunt the deer.\r\n\r\nThe Indians had brought a few beaver and other furs to trade, and, after\r\nreceiving a good meal and a few presents, they took up their quarters on\r\na plot of ground close to the fort.  Here they lived a short time in\r\nperfect friendship with the Esquimaux, visiting them, and hunting in\r\ncompany; but more than once they exhibited their natural disposition by\r\nstealing the goods of their neighbours.  On one occasion, two Esquimau\r\nchildren were missed from the camp, and in the course of the day they\r\nreturned to their parents clothed in Indian costume!  This was a very\r\npolite piece of attention on the part of the Indians, but the effect of\r\nit was much marred, the same day, by the abstraction of a knife from an\r\nEsquimau tent.  Stanley insisted on the article being restored, and\r\nseverely reprimanded the offender.  But, although the general harmony of\r\nthe camp was sometimes broken by such events, the friendship between the\r\ntwo parties seemed to be gradually increasing, and Stanley saw with\r\nsatisfaction that the Allat and the Innuit bade fair to become fast\r\nfriends for the future.\r\n\r\nBut an event occurred at this time which put an end to their\r\nintercourse, and very much altered the aspect of affairs.  For some time\r\npast the men at the fort had been subject to rather severe attacks of\r\ncold, or a species of influenza.  This they unfortunately communicated\r\nto the Esquimaux, who seemed to be peculiarly susceptible of the\r\ndisease.  Being very fat and full-blooded, it had the most dreadful\r\neffect on the poor creatures, and at a certain stage almost choked them.\r\nAt last one night it was reported that ten of their number had died\r\nfrom absolute suffocation.  All of these had been strong and robust, and\r\nthey died after two days' illness.\r\n\r\nOne of those who were attacked was Edith's little friend, Arnalooa, and\r\njust before the ten Esquimaux died, Edith had gone down to the camp with\r\na present of beads to console her.  She found her much better, and,\r\nafter talking to her for some time, she took her leave, promising to pay\r\nher another visit next day.  True to her promise, Edith sallied forth\r\nafter breakfast with a little native basket on her arm.  About half an\r\nhour afterwards, while Stanley was sitting in the hall with his wife and\r\nFrank, they were startled by the sudden appearance of Edith, out of\r\nbreath from the speed with which she had run home, and her face\r\noverspread with a deadly paleness.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, my darling?\" cried her mother, starting up in\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! the Esquimaux are lying dead on the sand,\" gasped Edith, as she\r\nlaid her head on her mother's breast, \"and the rest are all gone.\"\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to hear more, Frank and Stanley took down their guns and\r\nhastened to the camp.  Here a scene of the most horrible kind presented\r\nitself.  The whole camp exhibited evidences of a hasty flight, and eight\r\nof the people who had died during the night were lying exposed on the\r\nrocks, with their white faces and ghastly eyeballs turned towards the\r\nsky.  The other two had been buried on the rocks under a heap of stones,\r\nwhich did not conceal them entirely from view.\r\n\r\n\"No wonder poor Edith was alarmed,\" said Stanley sadly, as he leaned on\r\nhis fowling-piece and surveyed the scene of desolation and death.\r\n\r\n\"I have been told,\" remarked Frank, \"that the Esquimaux have a\r\nsuperstitious dread of this river.  Oolibuck mentioned to me this\r\nmorning that he has had a good deal of conversation with the natives\r\nabout this disease, and they told him that it invariably attacks them\r\nwhen they enter this river, and carries them off by dozens; so that they\r\nnever come into it except when they require wood, and always stay as\r\nshort a time as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that's bad,\" said Stanley; \"I fear that it will go much against the\r\nsuccess of the establishment.  But we must hope better things; and,\r\ntruly, with this exception, all has gone well hitherto.  Said they\r\nanything more, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; they hinted, it seems, their intention of flying away from this\r\nfatal spot, and taking up their abode for the winter at the mouth of\r\nFalse River, where they can obtain a livelihood by seal-fishing; but\r\nOolibuck thought they did not mean to put the threat in execution, and\r\ndid not imagine that they were in such alarm that they would go off\r\nwithout burying their dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must do that for them, Frank,\" said Stanley, turning to retrace his\r\nsteps to the fort; \"send down as many of the men as you can spare\r\nto-day, and get it done at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" said Frank, as they walked along the beach, \"it seems that\r\nmany years ago the Moravian missionaries came to the mouth of this\r\nriver, and talked of setting up a trading-fort here; but, from some\r\ncause unknown, they gave up their design and went away.  Maximus has\r\nbeen telling me all he knows about the matter; but his reports are\r\nvague, and the event must have occurred, if it occurred at all, when he\r\nwas a child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very possibly, Frank.  You know the Moravians have settlements along\r\nthe coasts of Labrador, to the eastward of this.  They may have made an\r\nattempt long ago to push as far as this.  I have always had a high\r\nopinion of the energy and perseverance of these missionaries, but I\r\ncannot get over the incongruity of their strange way of mingling trade\r\nwith religion.  It seems to me an unnatural sort of thing for\r\nmissionaries to be fur-traders.  I do not mean by this to object to\r\ntheir system, however; I daresay it works well, but I've had no means of\r\njudging.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is strange,\" replied Frank; \"yet it seems a good plan.  The\r\nmissionaries trade there in order that they may live and preach.\r\n'Twould be a good thing for the Indian country if the same principles\r\nand practice actuated the traders; with this difference, that instead of\r\nmissionaries becoming fur-traders, the fur-traders would become\r\nmissionaries.  It does seem a species of infatuation,\" continued Frank,\r\nenergetically, as he warmed with the subject, \"that men, calling\r\nthemselves Christians, should live for years and years among the poor\r\nIndians of America and never once name to them the great and saving name\r\nof Christ.  Of course I do not wonder at those who make little or no\r\nprofession of Christianity; but there are men in the fur-trade who seem\r\nto be deeply impressed with the truths of God's Word--who are alive to\r\nthe fact that there is no name under heaven given among men whereby we\r\ncan be saved except the name of Christ--who know and feel that the\r\nIndians around them are living without God, and therefore without hope\r\nin the world--who feel that _Christ_ is _all in all_, and that the\r\nChristian religion, however perfect and beautiful as a code of morals,\r\nis utterly worthless as to salvation unless there be in the heart the\r\nspecial love of Jesus Christ;--men who admit and profess to believe all\r\nthis, yet never speak of Christ to the natives--never mention the name\r\nthat can alone save them from eternal destruction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be not hasty, Frank,\" replied Stanley.  \"I agree with you, that it is\r\nstrange indeed we do not see and hear more of this missionary spirit\r\namong the traders, and I, for one, take your words as a deserved rebuke\r\nto myself; but if there are, as you say, many among us who are deeply\r\nimpressed with the truths of God's Word, how know you that we never\r\nmention our Saviour's name to the Indians?  Although fur-traders do not\r\nmount the pulpit, they may, in private, make mention of that name, and\r\ndo an amount of good that will only be fully known when the trader, the\r\ntrapper, and the Indian shall stand side by side before the\r\njudgment-seat of Christ.  Observe, I do not say that this is actually\r\nthe case; I only suggest that it is possible--may I not add, probable?\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be so,\" returned Frank, \"it may be so, and God forgive me if I\r\nhave judged the men of the fur-trade unjustly; but I certainly know one\r\nwho has made somewhat of a profession of Christianity in his day, and\r\nyet has done next to nothing, and that one is Frank Morton.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll not gainsay that, Frank,\" said Stanley, with a quiet smile; \"and I\r\nthink we are not likely to err much when we apply censure to ourselves.\r\nIt is curious that you and I should have been thinking of the very same\r\nsubject.  A few days ago, while my wife and I were conversing together\r\nabout the Esquimaux, we agreed to devote a good deal of our leisure time\r\nnext winter to reading and explaining the Bible to our Esquimau\r\ninterpreters, in the hope that they may afterwards be the means of much\r\ngood among their poor countrymen.\"\r\n\r\nWhether or not the good resolutions made at this time were ever put in\r\npractice we cannot say.  Let us hope that they were.\r\n\r\nNot long after the sudden flight of the Esquimaux, the Indians struck\r\ntheir tents and took their departure for the interior, with the\r\nintention, as they said, of hunting for furs, but more probably, as\r\nMa-istequan suggested, to hunt the deer.  During all the time of their\r\nresidence at the fort, Maximus had kept out of their way as much as\r\npossible.  He seldom met them without a frown of hatred, for he regarded\r\nthem as the representatives of a race which had robbed him of his bride;\r\nand there were times when the giant's spirit chafed so fearfully at the\r\nsight of the red men, that nothing but the remembrance of his promise to\r\nStanley, to offer them no injury, prevented him from stirring up his\r\ntribe to overwhelm and destroy them.  It was, therefore, with a feeling\r\nof relief that Maximus beheld them march single file over the rocky\r\nplatform, and disappear in the ravine that led into the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe traders of Ungava were once more left in solitude, and from this\r\ntime forward, until the winter set in, they devoted all their energies\r\nto laying up a stock of provisions sufficient to last till spring.\r\n\r\nDick Prince and Massan were sent after the deer in company.  Augustus\r\nand Bryan were dispatched to a small lake to establish a fishery; in\r\nwhich they were very successful, and soon caught a large supply of\r\nexcellent white-fish, trout, and carp, which they gutted and hung up by\r\ntheir tails to dry and freeze.  Frank and Moses went to another small\r\nlake, about ten miles down the river, and built a hut of willows, in\r\nwhich they dwelt while engaged at the fishery.  As there was still much\r\nto be done in the way of completing the fort, and making furniture,\r\nStanley retained La Roche, Oolibuck, and the two Indians to assist him\r\nin this, as well as in the performance of the miscellaneous minor duties\r\nabout the station, such as cutting up firewood, covering the roofs of\r\nthe stores with tarpaulin, shooting such birds and animals as came near\r\nthe fort, constructing rude chairs and tables, cooking, etcetera,\r\netcetera; while Francois and Gaspard were sent up the river to fell\r\ntrees, for the purposes both of building and firewood.  Edith and her\r\nmother found ample occupation--the latter in the use of her needle and\r\nthe cares of the household; the former in learning her lessons, visiting\r\nher berry-ravine, dressing her doll (for she had a doll, as a matter of\r\ncourse), and in holding long and frequent converse with Chimo.\r\n\r\nThus they spent their time; too busily occupied to take much note of its\r\nrapid flight, and scarce noticing the lengthening nights and shortening\r\ndays, until needles of ice began with slow and silent progress to shoot\r\nacross and solidify the waters of the bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF SNOW ON THE FEELINGS, NOT TO MENTION THE LANDSCAPE--A\r\nWONDERFUL DOME OF ICE.\r\n\r\nThere are times and seasons, in this peculiar world of ours, when the\r\nheart of man rejoices.  The rejoicing to which we refer is not of the\r\nordinary kind.  It is peculiar; and, whether its duration be long or\r\nshort, its effect powerful or slight, it is quite distinct and emphatic.\r\nWe do not intend to enter into a detail of the occasions that call\r\nforth this feeling of exultation.  Far be it from us to venture into\r\nsuch perilous depths of philosophy.  Our sole reason for making these\r\npreliminary observations is, that we may, with proper emphasis,\r\nintroduce the statement, that one of these occasions of rejoicing is,\r\nwhen man arises from his couch, on a brilliant, sunny, sparkling\r\nmorning, gazes forth from his window, and beholds the landscape--which\r\nyesterday was green, and red, and brown, and blue--clad in a soft mantle\r\nof whitest snow!\r\n\r\nWhat! you don't agree with us?  You shudder at the preposterous idea of\r\nsuch a sight being fitted to rejoice the heart of man in any degree\r\nwhatever?  Well, well; do not sneer at our weakness.  If we cannot\r\nsympathise with each other on this subject, perchance there are other\r\nthings in which we can.  But whatever be _our_ opinion in regard to\r\nthis, the point that we have to deal with at present is, the opinion of\r\nEdith Stanley, who, on rising hastily one morning, and looking forth\r\nfrom her little window, evinced the rejoicing of her heart most\r\nemphatically, by her loud exclamation of delight and the sparkling of\r\nher bright blue eyes.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the cheerful lightness and the virgin purity of the\r\nmantle, which in itself tended to awaken emotions of gladness in Edith's\r\nheart, there was something in its sudden appearance that carried her\r\nback violently and vividly to bygone days.  The winter garb had no\r\nassociations, yet, with Ungava; but it had with Moose Fort, and the dear\r\ncompanions she used to play with there.  It recalled the time when she\r\nand her little friends sallied forth, each with her small wooden sledge\r\ndrawn after her by a line, to slide thereon down the banks of the frozen\r\nriver with headlong speed, and upset at the bottom amid shouts of\r\nlaughter.  It recalled the time when she made the first attempt to walk\r\nin snow-shoes, upon which occasion she tripped and fell into the snow,\r\nas a matter of course, and was advised to wait till she was older.  It\r\nrecalled the memory of her father's team of dogs, and the delightful\r\ndrives she used to have over the frozen river; which drives often\r\nresulted in an upset, perhaps several, and always resulted in fun.  It\r\nrecalled the house in the old fort that used to be her home; the row of\r\nhouses belonging to the men, to which she often went, and was always\r\nwelcomed as a great favourite; the water-hole on the river from which\r\nthe old Canadian drew his daily supply; and the snow-house in the yard\r\nwhich she built in company with Frank Morton, and which stood the whole\r\nwinter through, but gave way at last before the blazing sun of spring,\r\nand fell--as ill luck would have it--when she and Chimo were sitting\r\nthere, so that she and the dog together had a hard struggle ere they got\r\nfree.  All these, and many more thick-coming memories of other days,\r\nwere aroused by the vision of snow that met Edith's gaze that morning,\r\nand caused her heart with peculiar fervour to rejoice.\r\n\r\nWinter had now descended with iron grasp upon Ungava.  For some weeks\r\nthe frost had been so intense that every lake and pool was frozen many\r\ninches thick, and the salt bay itself was fringed with a thick and\r\never-accumulating mass of ice.  The snow which now fell was but the\r\nceremonial coronation of a king whose reign had commenced in reality\r\nlong before.\r\n\r\nBut the sunshine did not last long.  The rolling fogs and vapours of the\r\nopen and ice-laden sea beyond ascended over the wild mountains, obscured\r\nthe bright sky, and revealed the winter of the north in all its stern,\r\ncold reality.  Every cliff and crag and jagged peak had its crown of\r\nsnow, and every corrie, glen, and gorge its drifted shroud.  In places\r\nwhere the precipices were perpendicular, the grey rocks of the mountains\r\nformed dark blotches in the picture; but, dark although they were, they\r\ndid not equal in blackness the river, on which floated hundreds of\r\nmasses of ice and several ponderous icebergs, which had been carried up\r\nfrom the sea by the flood-tide.  Over this inky expanse the frost-smoke\r\nhung like a leaden pall--an evil spirit, as it were, which never left\r\nthe spot till protracted and intense frost closed the waters of the\r\nriver altogether, and banished it farther out to sea.  But this entire\r\nclosing of the river very seldom happened, and never lasted long.\r\n\r\nFort Chimo itself, at least as much of it as remained unburied, was a\r\nmere speck on the edge of the white plain at the mountain's foot, scarce\r\ndistinguishable, at a short distance, from the straggling black pines\r\nand willow bushes that seemed thrust out into the waste from the ravines\r\nabove and below the fort.  But on a nearer approach, the fort assumed an\r\nair of greater importance; the influences, too, of the cold, cheerless\r\nscene we have described, were broken and dissipated by the sights of\r\ncomfort and sounds of cheerfulness within.  The shout of the\r\nwater-drawer, as he roused the dogs and went forth with his empty cask,\r\nhauled on a little sledge, to draw from the bubbling spring behind the\r\nfort; the sounds of the hammer, the chisel, and the axe, in the\r\ncarpenter's shop; the merry clank of Bryan's hammer, and the bright\r\nflame that gleamed from the window of the forge,--all bore evidence of\r\nthe fact, that however powerful the influence of winter might be\r\nwithout, it had little power within the wooden walls of Fort Chimo, and\r\ncould not check the life, or heart, or industry of man.\r\n\r\nThe only other human being visible in the open air, besides the\r\nwater-drawer, was La Roche, who, with a fur cap covering his head and\r\nears, and leathern mittens on his hands, hewed and hacked the billets\r\nwith which he purposed to replenish the fire for cooking the mid-day\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nPausing in his labour, and dusting off the hoar-frost that covered his\r\neyebrows and whiskers, he looked at the edge of his hatchet for a few\r\nseconds with an expression of contempt.  Then, throwing the implement on\r\nhis shoulder, he crossed the yard and entered the blacksmith's shop.\r\n\r\n\"Bryan,\" said he, seating himself on the edge of the forge and filling\r\nhis pipe, while Vulcan's votary scattered a shower of gems from a\r\nwhite-hot bar of iron at every blow of his hammer--\"Bryan, you no fit\r\nfor not'ing.  Dat axe is blont encore.  Oui, c'est vrai.  Now dat is\r\ntres mal.  How you not can temper him edge better?\"\r\n\r\n\"Timper it better, is it?\" answered Bryan, putting the iron bar in the\r\nfire, and regarding his companion earnestly while he blew the bellows.\r\n\"Faix, 'tis mysilf I'd need to timper better, in order to put up wi' the\r\nlikes o' you, ye wretched crature.  How can ye expict it to kape its\r\nidge when ye lave it for iver lyin' among yer pots and kittles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat is not it,\" replied La Roche, applying a glowing coal to his pipe.\r\n\"'Tis de mauvais steel.  But I not com for to fight wid you.  Your\r\ntongue trop long pour dat.  I com for ax you to give me turn ov de\r\ngrindstone, s'il vous plait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye don't desarve it, Losh; but wait till I've finished this job and\r\nI'll lind ye a hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be-the-bye,\" resumed Bryan, when the metal was cooled, \"has Francois\r\nfinished that sled for Miss Edith?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oui,\" replied La Roche, seating himself at the grindstone. \"(Ah! pas si\r\nvite, a leet more slow, Bryan.)  Oui, him make it all ready; only want\r\nde ring-bolts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thin it won't want thim long.  Ye can take thim over to the shop when\r\nye go across.  There they are on the binch.\"\r\n\r\nBryan continued to turn the handle of the stone for some time in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"D'ye know, Losh,\" he resumed, \"whin Mister Frank is goin' to the\r\nfishery?\"\r\n\r\n\"He go demain, I b'lieve, and Mademoiselle Edith go too.\"\r\n\r\n\"None o' the min goin'?\" inquired the blacksmith.\r\n\r\n\"Non.  Monsieur Frank just go for to try if dere be any fish to be cotch\r\nby de hook; and I t'ink he go more for to give Edith one drive dan dat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely, Losh.  The poor purty little crature.  She's very fond o'\r\nsledgin' and walkin' in snow-shoes.  'Tis well for her, bekase there's a\r\nwant o' companions for her here intirely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! mercy, dat is superb, magnifique!\" said the Frenchman, feeling the\r\nedge of the axe with his thumb.  \"It sharp 'nuff to shave de hair off\r\nyour ogly face, Bryan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thin be off wid ye, an' don't kape me longer from my work.  An' shut\r\nthe door quick behind ye; there's cowld enough in the place already.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Bryan resumed his hammer, and La Roche, following the\r\nsnow-track across the yard, recommenced his labour of chopping firewood.\r\n\r\nNext day, Frank and Edith made preparations for the excursion alluded to\r\nin the foregoing conversation.\r\n\r\nThe object for which this excursion was undertaken was twofold--first,\r\nto ascertain if there were any fish in a large lake about ten miles\r\ndistant from the fort; and, secondly, to give little Edith a drive for\r\nthe good of her health.  Not that her health was bad, but several weeks\r\nof bad weather had confined her much to the house, and her mother\r\nthought the change would be beneficial and agreeable; and tenderly did\r\nthat mother's heart yearn over her little child, for she felt that,\r\nalthough she was all to Edith that a mother could be, nature had\r\nimplanted in her daughter's mind a longing desire for the companionship\r\nof little ones of her own age, which could not be satisfied by any\r\nsubstitute--not even that of a tender mother, who sought, by all the\r\nmeans in her power, to become a child again for Edith's sake.\r\n\r\nImmediately after breakfast that day Frank took Edith by the hand, and\r\nled her round by the back of the fort, towards the kennel where the dogs\r\nwere kept, intending to release Chimo, who was to have the honour of\r\nhauling the sledge of his young mistress.  In passing the spring, Edith\r\npaused, as she had often done before during the winter, to gaze with\r\nwonder on the transformation that had taken place in the appearance of\r\nthe once green and fertile spot.  Not only was it covered with deep\r\nsnow, but over the spring there was formed a singular dome of ice.  This\r\ndome was a subject of continual astonishment to every one at Ungava.  It\r\nhad commenced to rise soon after the first hard frosts had sealed up the\r\nlittle fountain from the open air.  As time passed by, the covering\r\nbecame thick ice, and was bulged gradually up above the surrounding\r\nwaste, until it reached an elevation of not much less than twelve or\r\nthirteen feet.  Inside of this the spring bubbled up as of yore.\r\n\r\n\"What think you, Edith?\" said Frank, as a sudden thought occurred to\r\nhim; \"shall I cut a doorway into that crystal house, and see if the\r\nspirit of the spring dwells there?\"\r\n\r\nEdith clapped her hands with delight at the idea, and urged her\r\ncompanion to begin at once.  Then, checking him as he was about to\r\ncommence the work with his hatchet, she said earnestly--\r\n\r\n\"Do spirits really dwell in the springs, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Eda, we must send to England for a lot of fairy tales to teach you\r\nwhat I mean.  I do but jest when I speak of spirits living there.  But\r\nmany books, have been written about pretended spirits and fairies, which\r\ntell us of their wonderful adventures, and what they said and did long\r\nago.  I shall tell you some of these stories one of these days.  But I\r\ndaresay there are no spirits in this spring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Faix, an' it would be a rale misfortune if there was, sir,\" remarked\r\nBryan, who came up at this moment, and touched his cap; \"for it would be\r\nonly sperits and wather, which wouldn't kape in this cowld climate.\r\nI've finished the ring-bolts for the sled, sir, an' came to see when ye\r\nwould have them fixed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put them in your pocket, Bryan, for a few minutes, and lend a hand here\r\nto cut a hole through this dome.\"\r\n\r\nAs Frank spoke, he drew a small axe from his belt, and began to lay\r\nabout him so vigorously that the icy splinters flew in all directions\r\nlike a shower of broken crystal.  Bryan seconded his efforts, and in\r\nless than half an hour a block of solid ice, about four feet high and\r\ntwo broad, was cut out and detached from the side of the dome.\r\n\r\n\"That'll do, Bryan,\" said Frank, when their work was nearly completed;\r\n\"I'll finish it myself now.  Go to the carpenter's house, and Francois\r\nwill show you what to do with the sled.\"\r\n\r\nAs Bryan walked away, Frank dealt the mass of ice a blow that split it\r\ninto several pieces, which he quickly removed, revealing to the\r\nastonished and eager gaze of his young companion a cavern of a most\r\nbeautiful light blue colour.  Taking Edith by the hand, he led her into\r\nthis icy cave.  Its walls were quite luminous and delicately blue,\r\nexcept in places where the green moss and earth around the spring had\r\nbeen torn from the ground and lifted up along with the dome.  Icicles\r\nhung in various places from the roof, and the floor was hard and dry,\r\nexcept in the centre, where the spring bubbled up through it, and cut a\r\nchannel across towards one side of the icy wall, where it disappeared\r\nunder the snow.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what a beautiful palace!\" cried Edith, with delight, after she had\r\ngazed around her for a few minutes in silent wonder and admiration.  \"I\r\nshall come and live here, Frank.  Oh! do come, and let us get chairs and\r\na small table, and make it our sitting-room.  We can come every day when\r\nthe sun shines and read, or you can tell me the tales about spirits and\r\nfairies you spoke of!\"\r\n\r\n\"A good idea, Eda; but I fear we would need a stove to keep us warm.  It\r\nstrikes me it will make a capital ice-house in spring to keep our fresh\r\nmeat in.  It will last long after the snow is melted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall make a palace of it in winter and a meat-store in\r\nspring,\" cried Edith, laughing, as she walked round this\r\nnewly-discovered house, examining its blue walls and peeping into the\r\ncold black spring.  Meanwhile Frank examined it with a view to the\r\nutilitarian purpose, and, after both of them had gone round it several\r\ntimes, they continued on their way towards the dog-kennel.\r\n\r\nThe sledge which Francois had constructed for Edith was made after the\r\nmodel of those used by the Esquimaux.  There were two stout runners, or\r\nskates, made of wood, for sliding over the snow.  These were slightly\r\nturned up, or rather _rounded_ up, in front, and attached to each other\r\nby means of cross bars and thin planks of wood; all of which were\r\nfastened, not by nails (for iron-work snaps like glass in such a cold\r\nclimate as that of Ungava), but by thongs of undressed sealskin, which,\r\nalthough they held the fabric very loosely together in appearance, were,\r\nnevertheless, remarkably strong, and served their purpose very well.\r\nTwo short upright bars behind served as a back to lean against.  But the\r\nmost curious part of the machine was the substance with which the\r\nrunners were shod, in order to preserve them.  This was a preparation of\r\nmud and water, which was plastered smoothly on in a soft condition, and\r\nthen allowed to freeze.  This it did in a few minutes after being\r\nexposed to the open air, and thus became a smooth, hard sheathing, which\r\nwas much more durable and less liable to break than iron, or indeed any\r\nother sheathing that could be devised.  This substance is, of course,\r\neasily repaired, and is always used by the Esquimaux in winter.\r\n\r\nEsquimau sledges being heavy, and meant for carrying a number of people,\r\nrequire large teams of dogs.  But Edith's sledge--or sled, as the men\r\ncalled it--was little.  Moreover, Edith herself was little and light,\r\ntherefore Chimo was deemed sufficiently powerful to draw it.  So\r\nthoroughly correct were they in this supposition, that when Edith was\r\nseated in her sledge for a trial trip, and Chimo harnessed, he ran away\r\nwith her and gave Frank a chase of half a mile over the river ere he\r\ncondescended to stop in his wild career.\r\n\r\nBut the intended excursion was suddenly interrupted and postponed, by an\r\nevent which we shall relate in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nBURIED ALIVE--BUT NOT KILLED--THE GIANT IN THE SNOW-STORM.\r\n\r\nThe event which prevented the excursion referred to in the last chapter\r\nwas neither more nor less than a snowstorm.  \"Was that all?\" say you,\r\nreader?  Nay, that was not all.  Independently of the fact that it was a\r\nsnowstorm the like of which you have never seen, unless you have\r\ntravelled in northern climes, it was a snow-storm that produced results.\r\nOf these, more hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe storm began with a sigh--a mysterious sigh, that swept over the\r\nmountains of Ungava with a soft, mournful wail, and died slowly away in\r\nthe distant glen of the Caniapuscaw, as if the spirit of the north wind\r\ngrieved to think of the withering desolation it was about to launch upon\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nThe gathering clouds that preceded and accompanied this sigh induced\r\nFrank Morton to countermand his orders for the intended journey.  In\r\norder to console Edith for the disappointment, he went with her into the\r\nhall, and, drawing a low stool towards the blazing stove, placed a\r\ndraught-board upon it.  Then he placed another and a lower stool beside\r\nthe first, on which he seated Edith.  Spreading a deerskin robe upon the\r\nground, he stretched himself thereon at full length, and began to\r\narrange the men.\r\n\r\nThe hall, which was formerly such a comfortless apartment, was now\r\ninvested with that degree of comfort which always gathers, more or less,\r\nround a place that is continually occupied.  The ceiling was composed of\r\na carpet of deerskin stretched tightly upon the beams.  The walls were\r\nhung all round with the thick heavy coats and robes of leather and fur\r\nbelonging to the inmates, and without which they never ventured abroad.\r\nThe iron stove in the centre of the apartment, with its pipe to conduct\r\naway the smoke, and its radiant fire of logs, emitted a cheerful glow in\r\nits immediate vicinity; which glow, however, was not intense enough to\r\nmelt the thick ice, or rather hoar-frost, an inch deep, with which the\r\ntwo windows were encrusted, to the almost total exclusion of the view\r\nand the serious diminution of the light.  The door was padded all round\r\nits edges with fur, which tended to check the bitter wind that often\r\nblew against it, and tempered the slight draught that did force its way\r\nthrough.  Altogether the hall at Fort Chimo was curious and\r\ncomfortable--rather shaggy in its general appearance, but sound and\r\ntrustworthy at bottom.\r\n\r\nA small rough table, the work of Frank Morton, stood close to the stove;\r\nand beside it was seated Mrs Stanley, with a soft yellow deerskin\r\nbefore her, which she was carefully transforming into a hunting coat for\r\nher husband.  On another and a larger table was spread the tea equipage.\r\nThose who would understand this aright must for _tea_ read _supper_.\r\nAmong fur-traders the two are combined.  Candles--dips made at the\r\nfort--had been brought some time ago by La Roche, who entered the hall\r\nby a back door which communicated with a passage leading to the kitchen\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\"What can have become of papa, I wonder?\"  Mrs Stanley designated her\r\nhusband by this epithet, in consequence of her desire to keep up the\r\nfiction of her being Edith's little sister or playfellow.\r\n\r\nFrank looked up from the board.  \"I know not,\" said he.  \"I left him\r\ngiving some orders to the men.  We have been getting things made snug\r\nabout the fort, for we expect a pretty stiff breeze to-night.--Take\r\ncare, Eda; your crown's in danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! so it is,\" cried Edith, snatching back her piece, and looking with\r\nintense earnestness at the board.\r\n\r\nFrank might have observed, had he not been too deeply engaged with his\r\ngame, that the expected stiff breeze had already come, and was whistling\r\nround the fort with considerable vigour.\r\n\r\n\"You'll beat me, Eda, if you play so boldly,\" said Frank, with a smile.\r\n\"There, give me another crown.\"\r\n\r\n\"And me too,\" said Edith, pushing up her piece.  As she spoke, the door\r\nburst open, and Stanley sprang into the room.\r\n\r\n\"Whew! what a night!\" he cried, shutting the door with a forcible bang,\r\nin order to keep out the snow-drift that sought to enter along with him.\r\n\r\nTwo moves would have made Frank the conqueror, but the gust of wind\r\nupset the board, and scattered the men upon the floor.\r\n\r\nStanley looked like a man of white marble, but the removal of his cap,\r\ncoat, and leggings produced a speedy and entire metamorphosis.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!  La Roche!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oui, monsieur.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, take my coat and shake the snow off it, and let's have supper as\r\nspeedily as may be.  The draughts without, Frank, are a little too\r\npowerful for the draughts within, I fear.--What, wife, making another\r\ncoat?  One would think you had vowed to show your affection for me by\r\nthe number of coats you made.  How many have you perpetrated since we\r\nwere married?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind; go and put on one now, and come to supper while it is hot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad it is hot,\" cried Stanley from his bedroom.  \"One needs\r\nunusual heat within to make up for the cold without.  The thermometer is\r\nthirty below.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the party in the hall were enjoying their evening meal, the men\r\nwere similarly employed beside the stove in their own habitation.  There\r\nwas not much difference in the two apartments, save that the confusion\r\nin that of the men was much greater, in consequence of the miscellaneous\r\nmass of capotes, caps, belts, discarded moccasins, axes, guns, and\r\nseal-spears, with which they saw fit to garnish the walls.  The fumes of\r\ntobacco were also more dense, and the conversation more uproarious.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a howlin' night,\" observed Massan, as a gust of more than usual\r\nviolence shook the door on its hinges.\r\n\r\n\"Me t'ink de snow-drift am as t'ick in de sky as on de ground,\" said\r\nOolibuck, drawing a live coal from the fire and lighting his pipe\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\n\"Hould on, boys!\" cried Bryan, seizing his chair with both hands, half\r\nin jest and half in earnest, as another blast shook the building to its\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nThe two Indians sat like statues of bronze, smoking their calumets in\r\nsilence, while Gaspard and Prince rose and went to the window.  But the\r\nfrozen moisture on the panes effectually prevented their seeing out.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed an awful night--such a night as had not, until now,\r\nvisited the precincts of Fort Chimo.  Viewed from the rocky platform on\r\nthe hill, the raging of the storm was absolutely sublime.  The wind came\r\nsometimes in short, angry gusts, sometimes in prolonged roars, through\r\nthe narrows, sweeping up clouds of snow so dense that it seemed as\r\nthough the entire mass had been uplifted from the earth, hurling it\r\nupwards and downwards and in circling eddies, past the ravines, and\r\nround the fort, and launching it with a fierce yell into the valley of\r\nthe Caniapuscaw.  The sky was not altogether covered with clouds, and\r\nthe broken masses, as they rolled along, permitted a stray moonbeam to\r\ndart down upon the turmoil beneath, and render darkness visible.\r\nSometimes the wind lulled for a second or two, as if to breathe; then it\r\nburst forth again, splitting through the mountain gorges with a shriek\r\nof intensity; the columns of snow sprang in thousands from every hollow,\r\ncliff and glen, mingled in wild confusion, swayed, now hither, now\r\nthither, in mad uncertainty, and then, caught by the steady gale, pelted\r\non, like the charging troops of ice-land, and swept across the frozen\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nCould human beings face so wild a storm as this?  Ay, they could--at\r\nleast they could dare to try!\r\n\r\nThere was one traveller out upon the hills on that tremendous night.\r\nThe giant was in the midst of it; but weak as the bulrush were the\r\nmighty limbs of Maximus before the rushing gale.  Several days previous\r\nto this the Esquimau had been sent down to his brethren at False River,\r\nto procure some seal-meat for the dogs, and to ascertain the condition\r\nof the natives and their success in fishing.  On arriving, he found that\r\nthey had been so far successful, that starvation (their too frequent\r\nguest) had not yet visited their dwellings of snow.  But Maximus found\r\nthe old woman who had formerly saved his life very ill, and apparently\r\nabout to die.  Having learned from experience the efficacy of Stanley's\r\nmedicines, he resolved to procure some for the old woman, whom he had\r\ntenderly watched over and hunted for ever since the eventful day of the\r\nattack.  His dogs were exhausted, and could not return.  But the bold\r\nEsquimau was in the prime of life, and animated by the fire of vigorous\r\nyouth.  The storm was beginning to mutter in the distance.  What then?--\r\nHad he not faced the blasts of the frozen regions many a time before?--\r\nWithout saying a word, he threw a junk of seal-flesh into his wallet,\r\nand, striding back upon his track at the mountain's base, he disappeared\r\nin the driving snow.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching the fort, however, the full fury of the storm had burst\r\nupon him.  It cast him headlong into the snow; but he rose and staggered\r\non.  Again it burst forth, and again he fell before it like a stately\r\npine.  Rising to his knees, Maximus draw the hood of his hairy garment\r\nclose round his head and face, and tried to peer through the driving\r\nsnow; but he could not see until a slight lull came; then he observed a\r\nhummock of ice at a short distance, and, rising, made towards it.  The\r\nlulls were short-lived, however.  The storm threw him down again;\r\ninstantly he was drifted over with snow; another blast came, lifted the\r\ndrift into the air, and left the Esquimau exposed to all its fury.  But\r\nMaximus was not conquered.  He rose again, panting, it is true, but\r\nsturdy as ever, and ready to take advantage of the next lull.  It came\r\nsoon; and he saw a rock, or, it might be, the base of a cliff close at\r\nhand.  With a quick run he reached it; and, going down on his knees,\r\nbegan with his gloved hands to scrape a hollow in the snow.  Having made\r\na hole big enough to contain his body, he lay down in it, and, pulling\r\nthe superincumbent snow down upon him, was almost buried in the ruin.\r\nScarcely had he drawn the hood of his coat well over his face, when\r\nanother burst of the storm dashed a column of curling drift upon the\r\nrock, and the place where he lay was covered up; not a wrinkle in the\r\ndrift remained to mark the spot where he was buried!\r\n\r\nAll that night the storm roared among mountains with bitter fury; but\r\nnext day the wind was subdued, and the sun shone brightly on the grey\r\nrocks and on the white wreaths of snow.  It shone in all the lustre of\r\nan unclouded winter sky.  Not only did the sun smile upon the scene, but\r\ntwo mock suns or parhelia, almost as bright as himself, shone on either\r\nside of him.  Yet no ray of light illuminated the dwellings of the\r\nfur-traders.  All was darkness there, until Stanley rose from his couch\r\nand lighted a candle, for the purpose of examining his watch.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!  Frank, Frank!\" he cried, entering the hall, while he hastily\r\nthrew on his garments; \"turn out, man; there's something wrong here.\r\n'Tis past noon, and dark as midnight.  Bring your watch; perhaps I'm\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\nFrank yawned vociferously, and sprang from his bed.  In two seconds more\r\nhe made his appearance in his trousers and shirt.\r\n\r\n\"Past twelve, no doubt of--yea-o-ow!  That accounts for my waking three\r\ntimes and going off again; but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey! what have we here?\" cried Stanley, as he opened the front door,\r\nand disclosed to view a solid wall of snow.\r\n\r\n\"Snowed up; dear me! eh! that's odd,\" said Frank, beginning to\r\ncomprehend the state of matters.\r\n\r\nSnowed up they were, undoubtedly; so thoroughly snowed up that there was\r\nnot a ray of daylight within their dwelling.  Had Frank been above the\r\nsnow, instead of below it, he would have seen that the whole fort was so\r\ncompletely buried that nothing was visible above the surface except the\r\nchimneys and the flagstaff.  After the first few moments of surprise had\r\npassed, it occurred to Stanley that they might ascend to the regions\r\nabove by the chimney, which was wide enough, he thought, to admit a man;\r\nbut on looking up, he found that it also was full of drifted snow.\r\nThis, however, could have been easily removed; but there was a bar of\r\niron stretching across, and built into the clay walls, which rendered\r\nescape by that passage impossible.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing for it, Frank, but to dig ourselves out, so the sooner\r\nwe begin the better.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time they were joined by Edith and her mother, who, although\r\nmuch surprised, were not at all alarmed; for rough travelling in a wild\r\nland had taught them to regard nothing as being dangerous until it was\r\nproved to be so.  Besides, Stanley had assured them that they had\r\nnothing to fear, as the only evil he anticipated would be the trouble\r\nthey were sure to have in getting rid of the superabundant snow.  While\r\nthey were talking, the back door was opened violently, and La Roche, in\r\na state of dishabille, burst into the room.\r\n\r\n\"O messieurs, c'est fini!  Oui, le world him shut up tout togedder.  Oh,\r\nmisere!  Fat shall ye to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue, La Roche,\" said Frank, \"and bring the kitchen\r\nshovel.\"\r\n\r\nThe cook instantly turned to obey, and as he rushed towards the kitchen\r\nhis voice was heard exclaiming in the passage--\r\n\r\n\"Ah, c'est terrible!  Mais I ver' moshe fear de shovel be out in de\r\nneige.  Ah, non; here it is.  C'est bien.\"\r\n\r\nReturning in haste to the hall, he handed a much dilapidated iron shovel\r\nto Frank, who threw off his coat and set to work with vigour.  The\r\ntables and chairs, and all the furniture, were removed into the inner\r\napartments, in order to afford room for the snow which Frank dug from\r\nthe open doorway and shovelled into the centre of the room.  As only one\r\nat a time could work in the narrow doorway, the three men wrought with\r\nthe shovel by turns; and while one was digging the tunnel, the other two\r\npiled the debris in a compact mound beside the stove.  As no fire had\r\nyet been kindled, the snow, of course, did not melt, but remained crisp\r\nand dry upon the floor.  Meanwhile Edith looked on with deep interest,\r\nand occasionally assisted in piling the snow; while her mother, seeing\r\nthat her presence was unnecessary, retired to her own room.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" cried Frank, pausing and surveying an immense cavern which he\r\nhad dug into the drift, \"that's a good spell.  Take a turn now, La\r\nRoche, and dig upwards; we should see daylight soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, vraiment, it be time, for it am von o'clock,\" replied La Roche, as\r\nhe plied the shovel.\r\n\r\nThe tunnel was cut in such a way as that, while it ran outwards, it also\r\nsloped upwards; and, from the angle at which it lay, Stanley calculated\r\nthat thirty feet or thereabouts would bring them to the surface.  In\r\nthis he was correct, for when La Roche had worked for half an hour, the\r\nsnow above became slightly luminous.  But the labour of conveying it\r\nfrom the end of the tunnel into the hall became, of course, greater as\r\nthe work advanced.  At length the light penetrated so clearly that La\r\nRoche was induced to thrust his shovel upwards, in the expectation of\r\npenetrating the mass.  The effect of this action was striking and\r\nunexpected.  Instantly the roof fell in, and a flood of sunshine poured\r\ninto the tunnel, revealing the luckless Frenchman struggling amid the\r\nruins.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, pull me hout!\" he spluttered, as Frank and Stanley stood laughing\r\nheartily at his misfortune.  One of his legs happened to protrude from\r\nthe mass as he made this earnest request; so Frank seized it, and\r\ndragged the poor man by main force from his uncomfortable position.\r\nImmediately afterwards they all three scrambled through the aperture,\r\nand stood in open day.\r\n\r\nThe sight that met their eyes was a curious though not a satisfactory\r\none.  All that remained visible of Fort Chimo were, as we have said, the\r\nchimneys and the flagstaff.  In regard to the general aspect of the\r\nneighbourhood, however, there was little alteration; for the change of\r\nposition in the drifts among the mountain gorges, and the addition to\r\ntheir bulk, made no striking alteration in the rugged landscape.  In\r\nsome places the gale had cleared the sides of the mountains and left\r\ntheir cliffs exposed to view; in other spots the gorges and ravines were\r\nchoked up, and the pine tops nearly covered; and the open water in the\r\nlake was more encumbered than usual with icebergs.\r\n\r\n\"Now, La Roche,\" said Stanley, after they had surveyed the desolate\r\nscene for a few minutes in silence, \"go fetch the shovel and we'll dig\r\nout the men.  I daresay, poor fellows, they're beginning to wonder at\r\nthe length of the night by this time.\"\r\n\r\nLa Roche prepared to descend into the tunnel, when their attention was\r\narrested by a strange sound beneath the snow.  In a few minutes the\r\ncrust began to crack at a spot not more than two yards from where they\r\nstood; then there was a sudden rupture, accompanied by a growl, and\r\nfollowed by the appearance of the dishevelled head and arms of a man.\r\n\r\n\"Musha, boys, but I'm out!\"  Bryan coughed the snow from around his\r\nmouth, and winked it from his eyes, as he spoke.  The first sight that\r\nmet his bewildered gaze was three pair of expanded eyeballs and three\r\ndouble rows of grinning teeth, a few feet from his face.  Uttering a cry\r\nof terror, he fell back into the hole, the snow closed over him, and he\r\nwas gone!\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be added that Frank and Stanley commenced to dig into\r\nthis hole with as much vigour as their frequent explosions of laughter\r\nwould allow.  In a few minutes it was re-opened, and the men issued one\r\nby one from durance vile.\r\n\r\n\"Och, sirs, ye gave me a mortial start!\" exclaimed Bryan, as he rose to\r\nview the second time.  \"I thought for sartin ye were all polar bears.\r\nFaix we've had a job o't down there.  I'll be bound to say there's\r\ntwinty ton o' snow--bad luck to it--in the middle o' the floor.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's work for us here that'll last two weeks, I guess,\" said Massan,\r\nas he and several of the others stooped down and gazed into the tunnel\r\nleading to the hall, at the end of which Edith's laughing face met their\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\"When did you awake, and begin to suspect that something was wrong?\"\r\ninquired Stanley of Dick Prince.\r\n\r\n\"Awake!\" cried Bryan, answering the question; \"we awoke at laste a dozen\r\ntimes.  I suppose it must have bin the time for brikfust; for, ye see,\r\nalthough we could ha' slept on long enough; our intariors couldn't, be\r\nno manes, forgit their needcessities.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to work a bit yet ere these necessities are attended to,\r\nI fear,\" said Stanley.  \"Go, Francois, and one or two of you, and open\r\nup the dog-kennel.  The rest of you get all the shovels you can lay\r\nhands on, and clear out the houses as fast as you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clear out de chimbleys fust, mes garcons,\" cried La Roche, looking up\r\nfrom the tunnel.  \"Den ve vill git dejeuner ready toute suite.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will we, lad,\" said Bryan, shouldering a spade and proceeding\r\ntowards the chimney of the hall; while the rest of the party, breaking\r\nup into several groups, set to work, with spades, shovels, and such\r\nimplements as were suitable, to cut passages through the square of the\r\nfort towards the doors of the several buildings.  As Massan had said, it\r\nproved to be no light work.  The north-west gale had launched the snow\r\nupon the exposed buildings of Fort Chimo until the drift was fifteen or\r\nsixteen feet deep, so that the mere cutting of passages was a matter of\r\nconsiderable time and severe labour.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Maximus awoke, and sought to raise himself from his lair at\r\nthe foot of the rock.  But his first effort failed.  The drift above him\r\nwas too heavy.  Abandoning, therefore, the idea of freeing himself by\r\nmain force, he turned round on his side and began to scrape away the\r\nsnow that was directly above his head.  The masses that accumulated in\r\nthe course of this process he forced down past his chest; and, as his\r\nmotions tended to compress and crush the drift around him in all\r\ndirections, he soon made room enough to work with ease.  In ten minutes\r\nhe approached so near to the surface as to be able, with a powerful\r\neffort, to burst it upwards, and step out of his strange dormitory into\r\nthe sunshine.\r\n\r\nThis method of spending the night has been resorted to more than once by\r\narctic travellers who had lost their way; and it is sad to think that\r\nmany who have perished might have saved their lives had they known that\r\nburrowing could be practised with safety.  The Esquimaux frequently\r\nspend the night in this manner, but they prefer building a snow-house to\r\nburrowing, if circumstances will permit.\r\n\r\nCutting a slice of seal-meat, and eating as he went, Maximus resumed his\r\njourney, and soon afterwards arrived at the fort, where he found the men\r\nbusied in excavating their buried dwellings.\r\n\r\nHere he stated the case of the old woman, and received such medicines as\r\nStanley, in his amateur medical wisdom, saw fit to bestow.  With these\r\nhe started immediately to retrace his steps, having been directed to\r\nproceed, after administering them, to the lake where Frank meant to try\r\nthe fishing under the ice.  A family of Esquimaux had been established\r\non another lake not so far distant from the fort; and having been taught\r\nby the fur-traders how to set nets under the ice, they succeeded in\r\nprocuring more than enough for their subsistence.  It was hoped,\r\ntherefore, that the larger lake would afford a good supply; and, the\r\nweather having become decidedly fine, Frank prepared to set out on the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nAN EXCURSION--IGLOO BUILDING, AND FISHING UNDER THE ICE--A SNOW-TABLE\r\nAND A GOOD FEAST--EDITH SPENDS THE NIGHT UNDER A SNOW-ROOF FOR THE FIRST\r\nBUT NOT THE LAST TIME.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, Edith,\" cried Frank, looking in at the door of the hall,\r\n\"your carriage waits, and Chimo is very restive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Coming, coming,\" exclaimed a treble voice within; \"I'm getting new\r\nlines put to my snow-shoes, and will be ready in two minutes.\"\r\n\r\nTwo minutes, translated into female language, means ten, sometimes\r\ntwenty.  Frank knew this, and proceeded to re-adjust the sash that\r\nsecured his leathern capote, as he walked towards the little sledge in\r\nfront of the fort.  He then tied down the ear-pieces of his fur cap more\r\ncarefully, for it was very cold, though clear and sunny.  The frost had\r\nset fast the lake opposite the fort, and, by thus removing the\r\nfrost-cloud that overhung the open water farther out to sea, relieved\r\nthe fort from the mists in which it was usually enveloped.  By this time\r\nfifteen out of the \"two\" minutes having elapsed, he re-examined the lock\r\nof his gun, and adjusted the warm deerskin robe on Edith's little\r\nsledge, patted Chimo on the head, looked up at the clouds, and began to\r\nwhistle.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Frank, here I am,\" cried Edith, running towards him with her\r\nsnow-shoes in her hand, followed by her father and mother.\r\n\r\n\"Quiet, Chimo--down, sir!\" said Frank, restraining the dog as it sought\r\nto bound towards its mistress.  Being harnessed to the sledge, this was\r\na very improper proceeding and was rebuked accordingly; so Chimo was\r\nfain to crouch on the snow and look back at Edith as Frank placed her in\r\nthe sledge, and arranged the deerskin robes round her.\r\n\r\nEdith wore a long fur cloak and cloth leggings.  Her feet were protected\r\nfrom the cold by two pair of blanket socks, besides very thick moccasins\r\nof deerskin.  The usual head-dress of civilised females in these regions\r\nis a round fur cap; but Edith had a peculiar affection for the Cree\r\nIndian headdress, and, upon the present occasion, wore one which was\r\nlined with fur and accommodated with ear-pieces, to defy the winter\r\ncold.  The child's general appearance was somewhat rotund.  Painters\r\nwould probably have said there was a little too much breadth, perhaps,\r\nin the picture.  Her pointed cap, however, with the little bow of ribbon\r\non the top, gave her a piquant air, and did away with the heavy\r\nappearance of her costume to some extent; in fact, Edith looked like a\r\nfat little witch.  But if she looked fat before being wrapped up in the\r\nsledge furs, she looked infinitely fatter when thus placed, and nothing\r\nof her visible except her two twinkling eyes.  So grotesque was she that\r\nthe whole party burst into a loud laugh as they surveyed her.  The laugh\r\nmade Chimo start off at full gallop, which caused Frank to grasp the\r\nline of the sledge that trailed behind, and hurry over the snow at a\r\nmost undignified pace.\r\n\r\n\"Take care of her,\" cried Mr Stanley.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" shouted Frank.--\"Softly, Chimo--softly, you rascal!\"\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes the travellers were round the point and fairly out of\r\nsight; but the shouts of Frank, and an occasional howl from Chimo,\r\nfloated back on the breeze as Stanley and his wife returned leisurely to\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\nThe road, or rather the ground, over which Frank Morton drove Edith that\r\nday was exceedingly rough and rugged--so rough that we will not try the\r\nendurance of the reader by dragging him over it.  We will merely\r\nindicate its general features.  First of all, they drove about three\r\nmiles along the level snow at the foot of the mountains.  So far the\r\nroad was good; and Chimo went along merrily to the music of the little\r\nthimble-like brass bells with which his harness was garnished.  Then\r\nthey came to a ravine, and Edith had to get out, put on her snow-shoes,\r\nand clamber up, holding by Frank's hand; while Chimo followed, dragging\r\nthe sledge as he best could.  Having gained one of the terraces, Edith\r\nslipped her feet out of the snow-shoe lines, jumped into the sledge, and\r\nwas swept along to the next ravine, where she got out again, resumed her\r\nsnow-shoes, and ascended as before.  Thus they went up the ravines and\r\nalong the terraces until the summit of the first mountain range was\r\nreached.  Having rested here a few minutes, Edith once more got into the\r\nsledge, and Chimo set off.  But as there was now a long piece of level\r\nground over which for some miles they could travel in the direction of\r\nthe coast, Frank took the sled-line in his hand, and held the dog at a\r\nquick walking pace.  Afterwards they turned a little farther inland, and\r\ncame into a more broken country, where they had sometimes to mount and\r\nsometimes to descend the hills.  There were many gorges and narrow\r\nfissures in the ground here, some of which were covered over and so\r\nconcealed with snow that the travellers ran some risk of falling into\r\nthem.  Indeed, at one place, so narrow was their escape that Chimo fell\r\nthrough the crust of snow, and disappeared into a fissure which\r\ndescended a hundred feet sheer down; and the sledge would certainly have\r\nfollowed had not Frank held it back by the line; and Chimo was not\r\nhauled up again without great difficulty.  After this, Frank went in\r\nfront with a pole, and sounded the snow in dangerous-looking places as\r\nhe went along.\r\n\r\nTowards the afternoon they arrived at the lake where they intended to\r\nencamp, and, to their great delight, found Maximus there already.  He\r\nhad only arrived a few minutes before them, and was just going to\r\ncommence the erection of a snow-house.\r\n\r\n\"Glad to see you, Maximus,\" cried Frank, as he drove up.  \"How's the old\r\nwoman, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"She small better,\" replied Maximus, assisting Edith to alight.  \"Dis\r\ngoot for fish.\"\r\n\r\nMaximus was a remarkably intelligent man, and, although his residence at\r\nthe fort had been of short duration as yet, he had picked up a few words\r\nof English.\r\n\r\n\"A good lake, I have no doubt,\" replied Frank, looking round.  \"But we\r\nneed not search for camping ground.  There seems to be very little wood,\r\nso you may as well build our hut on the ice.  We shall need all our\r\ntime, as the sun has not long to run.\"\r\n\r\nThe lake, on the edge of which they stood, was about a mile in\r\ncircumferenee, and lay in a sort of natural basin formed by\r\nsavage-looking hills, in which the ravines were little more than narrow\r\nfissures, entirely devoid of trees.  Snow encompassed and buried\r\neverything, so that nothing was to be seen except, here and there, crags\r\nand cliffs of gray rock, which were too precipitous for the snow to rest\r\non.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Eda, I will take a look among these rocks for a ptarmigan for\r\nsupper; so you can amuse yourself watching Maximus build our house till\r\nI return.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Frank,\" said Edith; \"but don't be long.  Come back before\r\ndark; Chimo and I will weary for you.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Frank disappeared among the rocks upon the shore; and\r\nMaximus, taking Edith by the hand, and dragging her sledge after him,\r\nled her a couple of hundred yards out on to the ice, or, more properly\r\nspeaking, the hard beaten snow with which the ice was covered.  Chimo\r\nhad been turned loose, and, being rather tired after his journey, had\r\ncoiled himself up on a mound of snow and fallen fast asleep.\r\n\r\n\"Dis place for house,\" said Maximus, pausing near a smooth, level part\r\nof the lake.  \"You stop look to me,\" he added, turning to the little\r\ngirl, who gazed up in his large face with an expression half of wonder\r\nand half of fun.  \"When you cold, run; when you hot, sit in sled and\r\nlook at me.\"\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this request, Edith sat down in her sledge, and from\r\nthis comfortable point of view watched the Esquimau while he built a\r\nsnow-hut before her.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, he drew out a long iron knife, which had been constructed\r\nspecially far him by Bryan, who looked upon the giant with special\r\nfavour.  With the point of this he drew a circle of about seven feet in\r\ndiameter; and so well accustomed was he to this operation that his\r\ncircle, we believe, could not have been mended even by a pair of\r\ncompasses.  Two feet to one side of this circle he drew a smaller one,\r\nof about four feet in diameter.  Next, he cut out of the snow a number\r\nof hard blocks, which were so tough that they could not be broken\r\nwithout a severe blow, but were as easily cut as you might have sliced a\r\nsoft cheese with a sharp knife.  These blocks he arranged round the\r\nlarge circle, and built them above each other, fashioning them, as he\r\nproceeded, in such a manner that they gradually rose into the form of a\r\ndome.  The chinks between them he filled compactly with soft snow, and\r\nthe last block, introduced into the top of the structure, was formed\r\nexactly on the principle of the key-stone of an arch.  When the large\r\ndome was finished, he commenced the smaller; and in the course of two\r\nhours both the houses--or, as the Esquimaux call them, igloos--were\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nLong before this, however, Frank had returned, from an unsuccessful\r\nhunt, to assist him; and Edith had wondered and wearied, grown cold and\r\ntaken to running with Chimo, and grown warm and returned to her sledge,\r\nseveral times.  Two holes were left in the igloos to serve as doors;\r\nand, after they were finished, the Esquimau cut a square hole in the top\r\nof each, not far from the key-stones, and above the entrances.  Into\r\nthese he fitted slabs of clear ice, which formed windows as beautiful\r\nand useful as if they had been made of glass.  There were two doorways\r\nin the large igloo, one of which faced the doorway of the smaller.\r\nBetween these he built an arched passage, so that the two were thus\r\nconnected, and the small hut formed a sort of inner chamber to the\r\nlarger.\r\n\r\n\"Now, dem done,\" said Maximus, surveying his work with a satisfied\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"And very well done they are,\" said Frank.  \"See here, Eda, our\r\nsnow-fort is finished.  The big one is to be the grand hall and\r\nbanqueting-room, and yonder little hut is your private boudoir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine!\" exclaimed Edith, running away from Chimo, with whom she had been\r\nplaying, and approaching the new houses that had been so speedily put\r\nup.  \"Oh, how nice! what fun! only think!--a snow bedroom!  But won't it\r\nbe cold, Frank?  And is the bed to be of snow too?\"\r\n\r\nThe black moustache of the giant curled with a smile at the energy with\r\nwhich this was said.\r\n\r\n\"We will make the bedsteads of snow, Eda,\" replied Frank, \"but I think\r\nwe shall manage to find blankets of a warmer material.--Now, Maximus,\r\nget the things put inside, and the lamp lighted, for we're all tired and\r\nvery hungry.\"\r\n\r\nThe lamp to which Frank referred was one which Maximus had brought,\r\nalong with a few other articles, from the Esquimau camp.  It was made of\r\nsoft stone, somewhat in the form of a half moon, about eight inches long\r\nand three broad, and hollowed out in the inside.  Esquimaux burn\r\nseal-fat in it, and in winter have no other means of warming their\r\nhouses or cooking their food.  But for both purposes it is quite\r\nsufficient.  The heat created by these lamps, combined with the natural\r\nwarmth of the inhabitants, is frequently so great in the igloos of the\r\nEsquimaux that they are fain to throw off a great portion of their upper\r\ngarments, and sit in a state of partial nudity; yet the snow-walls do\r\nnot melt, owing to the counteracting influence of the intense cold\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nMaximus had brought some seal-fat, or blubber, along with him.  A\r\nportion of this he now put into the lamp, and, placing the latter on a\r\nsnow-shelf prepared expressly for it, he set it on fire.  The flame,\r\nalthough not very steady, was bright enough to illuminate the large\r\nigloo, and to throw a strong gleam into the smaller one.  Over this lamp\r\nFrank placed a small tin kettle, filled with snow, which was speedily\r\nconverted into water; and while this was being boiled, he assisted Edith\r\nin spreading out the bedding.  As we have already said, the floor of\r\nthis snow-house was of the same material as the walls.  But one-half of\r\nit was raised about a foot above the other half, according to Esquimau\r\nrules of architecture.  This elevated half was intended for the bed,\r\nwhich consisted of a large deer-skin robe, spread entirely over it, with\r\nthe soft hair upwards.  Another large robe was placed above this for a\r\nblanket, and a smaller one either for a pillow or an additional covering\r\nif required; but both of these were tossed down in a heap at the present\r\ntime, to form a luxuriant seat for Frank and Edith.  As their legs hung\r\nover the edge of the elevated couch, they were thus seated, as it were,\r\non an ottoman.  A mat of interlaced willows covered the floor, and on\r\nthis sat Maximus, towering in his hairy garments like a huge bear, while\r\nhis black shadow was cast on the pure white wall behind him.  In the\r\nmidst stood a small table, extemporised by Frank out of a block of snow,\r\nand covered with the ample skirt of his leathern topcoat, which the\r\nincreasing temperature of the air inside the igloo rendered too warm.\r\n\r\nBeside Edith, on the most comfortable portion of the ottoman, sat Chimo,\r\nwith an air of majestic solemnity, looking, as privileged dogs always do\r\nlook under like circumstances, as if the chief seat belonged to him as a\r\nmatter not of favour but of right.  On the table was spread a solid lump\r\nof excellent pemmican--excellent, because made by the fair hands of Mrs\r\nStanley.  It stood _vis-a-vis_ to a tin plate whereon lay three large\r\nsteaming cuts of boiled fresh salmon--fresh, because, although caught\r\nsome months before, it had been frozen solid ever since.  There was a\r\nlarge tin kettle of hot tea in the centre of the board--if under the\r\ncircumstances we may use the term--and three tin cups out of which to\r\ndrink it; besides a plate containing broken pieces of ship-biscuit and a\r\nsmall quantity of sugar wrapped up in a morsel of paper.  Also a little\r\nsalt in a tin box.\r\n\r\nAll these things, and tempting delicacies, had up till now been\r\ncontained within the compass of a small, compact, insignificant-looking\r\nparcel, which during the journey had occupied a retiring position in the\r\nhinder part of Edith's sledge--so true is it that the really _great_ and\r\nthe _useful_ court concealment until duty calls them forth and reveals\r\ntheir worth and their importance to an admiring world.  The admiring\r\nworld on the present occasion, however, consisted only of Frank, Edith,\r\nMaximus, and Chimo; unless, indeed, we may include the moon, who at that\r\nmoment poured her bright beams through the ice-window of the hut and\r\nflooded the centre of the snow-table with light.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't we snug, Eda?\" cried Frank, as he filled her tin with tea.\r\n\"What a charming house! and so cheap, too!  There's sugar beside you.\r\nTake care you don't use salt by mistake.--Maximus, hold out your\r\npannikin.  That's the true beverage to warm your heart, if you take it\r\nhot enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tankee, sur,\" said the giant, extending his cup with one hand, while\r\nwith the other he forced into his capacious mouth as much pemmican as it\r\ncould hold.\r\n\r\n\"Frank,\" said Edith, \"we must build an igloo at the fort when we\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we will, now that I know how to do it.  Hand me the salt, please,\r\nand poke Chimo's nose away from the salmon.  Yes, and we'll invite papa\r\nand mamma to come and take supper at _our_ house.--Maximus, is this the\r\nexact way your friends build their winter houses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, sur,\" answered the Esquimau, looking up from the cut of salmon\r\nwhich he lifted with his fingers in preference to a fork or knife.  \"Dey\r\nalways buil' um so.  But not dis t'ing,\" he added, touching the\r\nsnow-table.\r\n\r\n\"No, I suppose not,\" said Frank.  \"I flatter myself that that is a\r\nrecent improvement.\"\r\n\r\n\"We do great many igloo sometime,\" continued Maximus, \"vid two, t'ree,\r\nfour--plenty pass'ges goin' into von a-doder.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does he mean by that?\" inquired Edith, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he means that they connect a number of their igloos together\r\nby means of passages.--And do they keep them as clean and snug as this,\r\nMaximus?\"\r\n\r\nThe Esquimau replied by a loud chuckle, and a full display of his\r\nmagnificent teeth, which Frank understood to signify a decided negative.\r\n\r\nWhen supper was ended Chimo was permitted to devour the scraps, while\r\nFrank assisted Edith to arrange her little dormitory.  It was much the\r\nsame in its arrangements as the larger apartment, and was really as\r\ncomfortable and warm as one could desire.  Returning to the large\r\napartment, Frank spread out the couch on which he and Maximus were to\r\nrepose; and then, sitting down beside the stone lamp, he drew forth his\r\nBible, as was his wont, and began to read.\r\n\r\nSoon after lying down Edith heard the deep voices of her companions\r\nengaged in earnest conversation; but these sounds gradually died away,\r\nand she fell asleep, to dream of her berry-ravine at Fort Chimo.  As the\r\nnight wore on, the deep breathing of the men told that they, too, had\r\nsought and found repose.  The lamp burned slowly down and went out, and,\r\nwhen the moon threw her parting rays over the scene, there was nothing\r\nto tell of the presence of human beings in that cold, wild spot, save\r\ntwo little white mounds on the frozen lake below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nFRANK MORTON GETS INTO DIFFICULTIES.\r\n\r\nChimo's loud bark and the angry snarl of a large wolf, as it darted away\r\nto seek the shelter of the kills, were the sounds that awoke our\r\ntravellers in the grey dawn of the following morning.\r\n\r\nFrank started up, seized his gun, and darted through the doorway of the\r\nigloo; in doing which he dashed the door of snow to atoms.  He had only\r\nthe satisfaction, however, of seeing the wolf's tail flourish in the\r\nair, as the animal bounded over a snow-drift and disappeared in a\r\nravine.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! how cold it is!\" he exclaimed, re-entering the igloo hastily; far\r\nhaving issued forth without his coat or cap, the two minutes during\r\nwhich he stood exposed to the open air cooled him down nearly to the\r\nfreezing point.  \"Hallo, Maximus! jump up; light the lamp while I fill\r\nthe kettle.  Heyday! it solidifies the very marrow in one's bones.  Ho,\r\nEdith! up with you, lazy thing; there has been a wolf to bid you\r\ngood-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Frank rattled on thus he belted his leathern coat round him, put\r\non his fur cap, and prepared breakfast; while Edith rose and resumed the\r\ncap and cloak which she had put off on lying down to rest.\r\n\r\n\"Maximus,\" said Frank, after the first duties of the day were concluded,\r\n\"we must now go and set the hooks; but as cutting holes in the ice will\r\noccupy you some time, I'll take a short walk along the margin of the\r\nlake with my gun.  Be careful of Edith till I return.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Frank went off, taking Chimo along with him; while Maximus\r\nseized the axe and ice-chisel, and began the laborious process of\r\ndigging through to the water.  The ice on the lake was five feet thick,\r\nbut by dint of great perseverance the Esquimau succeeded in making\r\nseveral holes through it ere Frank returned.  Each hole was large enough\r\nto contain the body of a man, but a little wider above than below.  In\r\nthese holes were set stout cod-lines, with hooks of about half an inch\r\nor more in diameter.  They were made of white metal, and clumsy enough\r\nto look at; but fish in the lakes of Ungava are not particular.  These\r\nhooks were baited with lumps of seal-fat, and ere half an hour elapsed\r\nthe success of the anglers was very decided and satisfactory.\r\n\r\nFrank hauled up a white-fish of about six pounds weight at the first\r\ndip, and scarcely had he thrown it on the ice when Maximus gave a\r\ngalvanic start, hauled up his line a few yards with laughable eagerness,\r\nthen stopped suddenly, under the impression, apparently, that it was a\r\nfalse alarm; but another tug set him again in motion, and in three\r\nseconds he pulled a fine lake-trout of about ten pounds weight out of\r\nthe hole.  Edith, also, who had a line under her care, began to show\r\nsymptoms of expectation.\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\" cried Frank, beating his hands violently against his\r\nshoulders; for handling wet line, with the thermometer at twenty below\r\nzero is decidedly cold work--\"capital! we must set up a regular fishery\r\nhere, I think; the fish are swarming.  There's another,--eh? no--he's\r\noff--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! oh!! oh!!!\" shrieked Edith in mingled fear and excitement, as, at\r\neach successive \"oh!\" she received a jerk that well-nigh pulled her into\r\nthe ice-hole.\r\n\r\n\"Hold hard!\" cried Frank; \"now then, haul away.\"  Edith pulled, and so\r\ndid the fish; but as it was not more than five pounds weight or so, she\r\novercame it after a severe struggle, and landed a white-fish on the ice.\r\n\r\nThe next shout that Edith gave was of so very decided and thrilling a\r\ncharacter that Frank and Maximus darted to her side in alarm, and the\r\nlatter caught the line as it was torn violently from her grasp.  For a\r\nfew minutes the Esquimau had to allow the line to run out, being unable\r\nto hold the fish--at least without the risk of breaking his tackle; but\r\nin a few seconds the motion of the line became less rapid, and Maximus\r\nheld on, while his huge body was jerked violently, notwithstanding his\r\nweight and strength.  Soon the line relaxed a little, and Maximus ran\r\naway from the hole as fast as he could, drawing the line after him.\r\nWhen the fish reached the hole it offered decided resistance to such\r\ntreatment; and being influenced, apparently, by the well-known proverb,\r\n\"Time about's fair play,\" it darted away in its turn, causing the\r\nEsquimau to give it line again very rapidly.\r\n\r\n\"He must be an enormously big fellow,\" said Frank, as he and Edith stood\r\nclose to the hole watching the struggle with intense interest.\r\n\r\nThe Esquimau gave a broad grin.\r\n\r\n\"Yis, he most very biggest--hie!\"\r\n\r\nThe cause of this exclamation of surprise was the slacking of the line\r\nso suddenly that Maximus was induced to believe the fish had escaped.\r\n\r\n\"Him go be-off.  Ho yis!\"\r\n\r\nBut he was wrong.  Another violent tug convinced him that the fish was\r\nstill captive--though an unwilling one--and the struggle was renewed.\r\nIn about a quarter of an hour Maximus dragged this refractory fish\r\nslowly into the hole, and its snout appeared above water.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! _what_ a fish!\" exclaimed Edith.\r\n\r\n\"Put in de spear,\" cried the Esquimau.\r\n\r\nFrank caught up a native spear which Maximus had provided, and just as\r\nthe fish was about to recommence the struggle for its life, he\r\ntransfixed it through the gills, and pinned it to the side of the\r\nice-hole.  The battle was over; a few seconds sufficed to drag the fish\r\nfrom its native element and lay it at full length on the ice.\r\n\r\nAnd few anglers have ever had the pleasure of beholding such a prize.\r\nIt was a trout of fully sixty pounds weight, and although such fish are\r\nseldom if ever found in other parts of the world, they are by no means\r\nuncommon in the lakes of North America.\r\n\r\nHaving secured this noble fish, Maximus cut it open and cleaned it,\r\nafter which it was left to freeze.  The other fish were then similarly\r\ntreated; and while the Esquimau was thus engaged, Frank and Edith\r\ncontinued their sport.  But daylight in these far northern regions is\r\nvery short-lived in winter, and they were soon compelled unwillingly to\r\nleave off.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Maximus,\" said Frank, as they rolled up their lines, \"I don't\r\nintend to keep you longer with us.  Edith and I can manage the fishing\r\nvery well, so you may return to your friends at False River, and take\r\nthe seal-flesh for the dogs up to the fort.  Get the loan of some of\r\ntheir dogs and a sled to haul it; and come round this way in passing, so\r\nas to pick up any fish we may have ready for you.  The moon will be up\r\nin a little, so be off as fast as you can.\"\r\n\r\nIn obedience to these orders, Maximus packed up a small quantity of\r\nprovisions, and bidding good-bye to his two friends, set off to make the\r\nbest of his way to the coast.\r\n\r\nThat night Frank and his little charge sat down to sup together in the\r\nigloo at the head of their snow-table, and Chimo acted the part of\r\ncroupier in the room of the Esquimau.  And a pleasant evening they\r\nspent, chatting, and laughing, and telling stories, by the light of the\r\nstone lamp, the mellow flame of which shed a warm influence over the\r\nsparkling dome of snow.  Before retiring to rest, Frank said that they\r\nmust be up with the first light, for he meant to have a hard day's\r\nfishing; but man little knows what a day may bring forth.  Neither Frank\r\nnor Edith dreamed that night of the events that were to happen on the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nOn awaking in the morning they were again roused by the voice of the\r\nwolf which had visited them the day before.  In order to catch this\r\nwolf, Maximus had, just before starting, constructed a trap peculiar to\r\nthe Esquimaux.  It was simply a hole dug down through the ice at the\r\nedge of the lake, not far from the igloo.  This hole was just wide\r\nenough to admit the body of a wolf, and the depth sufficient to render\r\nit absolutely impossible for the animal to thrust his snout to the\r\nbottom, however long his neck might be.  At the bottom a tempting piece\r\nof blubber, in very _high_ condition, was placed.  The result of this\r\ningenious arrangement was most successful, and, we may add, inevitable.\r\nAttracted by the smell of the meat, our friend the wolf came trotting\r\ndown to the lake just about daybreak, and sneaked suspiciously up to the\r\ntrap.  He peeped in and licked his lips with satisfaction at the\r\ncharming breakfast below.  One would have thought, as he showed his\r\nformidable white teeth, that he was laughing with delight.  Then,\r\nspreading out his fore legs so as to place his breast on the ice, he\r\nthrust his head down into the hole and snapped at the coveted blubber.\r\nBut he had mistaken the depth, and blaming himself, no doubt, for his\r\nstupidity, he slid a little further forward, and pushed his head deeper\r\ndown.  What! not at it yet?  Oh! this is preposterous!  Under this\r\nimpression he rose, shook himself, and advancing his shoulders as far as\r\nprudence would allow, again thrust down his head and stretched his neck\r\nuntil the very sinews cracked.  Then it was, but not till then, that the\r\nconviction was forced on him that that precious morsel was totally and\r\nabsolutely beyond his reach altogether.  Drawing himself back he sat\r\ndown on his haunches and uttered a snarling bark of dissatisfaction.\r\nBut the odour that ascended from that hole was too much for the powers\r\nof wolfish nature to resist.  Showing his teeth with an expression of\r\nmingled disappointment and ferocity, he plunged his head into the hole\r\nonce more.  Deeper and deeper still it went, but the blubber was yet\r\nthree inches from his eager nose.  Another shove--no! dislocation alone\r\ncould accomplish the object.  His shoulders slid very imperceptibly into\r\nthe hole.  His nose was within an inch of the prize, and he could\r\nactually touch it with his tongue.  Away with cowardly prudence! what\r\nrecked he of the consequences?  Up went his hind legs, down went his\r\nhead, and the tempting bait was gained at last!\r\n\r\nAlas for wolfish misfortunes!  His fore legs were jammed immovably\r\nagainst his ribs.  A touch of his hind foot on the ice would remedy this\r\nmishap, but he was too far in for that.  Vigorously he struggled, but in\r\nvain.  The blood rushed to his head, and the keen frost quickly put an\r\nend to his pains.  In a few minutes he was dead, and in half an hour he\r\nwas frozen, solid as a block of wood, with his hind legs and tail\r\npointing to the sky.\r\n\r\nIt was at the consummation of this event that another wolf, likewise\r\nattracted by the blubber, trotted down the wild ravine and uttered a\r\nhowl of delighted surprise as it rushed forward to devour its dead\r\ncompanion--for such is the custom among wolves.  And this was the howl\r\nthat called Frank forth in time to balk its purpose.\r\n\r\nFrank happened to be completely dressed at the time, and as he saw the\r\nwolf bound away up the mountain gorge, he seized his gun and snow-shoes,\r\nand hastily slung on his powder-horn and shot-belt.\r\n\r\n\"Edith,\" he cried, as he was about to start, \"I must give chase to that\r\nwolf.  I won't be gone long.  Light the lamp and prepare breakfast,\r\ndear--at least as much of it as you can; I'll be back to complete it.--\r\nHallo, Chimo! here, Chimo!\" he shouted, whistling to the dog, which\r\nbounded forth from the door of the hut and followed his master up the\r\nravine.\r\n\r\nEdith was so well accustomed to solitary wanderings among the rugged\r\nglens in the neighbourhood of Fort Chimo that she felt no alarm on\r\nfinding herself left alone in this wild spot.  She knew that Frank was\r\nnot far off, and expected him back in a few minutes.  She knew, also,\r\nthat wild animals are not usually so daring as to show themselves in\r\nopen ground after the break of day, particularly after the shouts of\r\nhuman beings have scared them to their dens; so, instead of giving a\r\nthought to any possible dangers that might threaten her, she applied\r\nherself cheerfully and busily to the preparation of their morning meal.\r\nFirst she lighted the lamp, which instantly removed the gloom of the\r\ninterior of the igloo, whose little ice-window as yet admitted only the\r\nfaint light of the grey dawn.  Then she melted a little snow, and\r\ncleaned out the kettle, in which she placed two cuts of fresh trout; and\r\nhaving advanced thus far in her work, thought it time to throw on her\r\nhood and peep out to see if Frank was coming.  But there was no sign of\r\nFrank, so she re-entered the igloo and began to set things to rights.\r\nShe folded up the deerskins on which she had reposed, and piled them at\r\nthe head of the willow matting that formed her somewhat rough and\r\nunyielding mattress, after which she arranged the ottoman, and laid out\r\nthe breakfast things on the snow-table.  Having accomplished all this to\r\nher entire satisfaction, Edith now discovered that the cuts of salmon\r\nwere sufficiently well boiled, and began to hope that Frank would be\r\nquick, lest the breakfast should be spoiled.  Under the influence of\r\nthis feeling she threw on her hood a second time, and going out upon the\r\nlake, surveyed the shore with a scrutinising gaze.  The sun was now so\r\nfar above the natural horizon that the daylight was pretty clear, but\r\nthe high mountains prevented any of his direct rays from penetrating the\r\ngloom of the valley of the lake.  Still there was light enough to enable\r\nthe solitary child to distinguish the objects on shore; but Frank's tall\r\nform was not visible anywhere.\r\n\r\nHeaving a slight sigh, Edith returned to the hut, soliloquising thus as\r\nshe went--\"Dear me! it is very strange that Frank should stay away so\r\nlong.  I fear that the trout will be quite spoiled.  Perhaps it would be\r\nvery good cold.  No doubt of it.  We shall have it cold, and then I can\r\nget the tea ready.\"\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this plan, the anxious little housekeeper removed the\r\ntrout from the kettle, which she cleaned out and refilled with snow.\r\nWhen this was melted and boiled, she put in the tea.  In due time this\r\nalso was ready, and she sallied forth once more, with a feeling\r\napproaching to anxiety, to look for Frank.  Still her companion did not\r\nmake his appearance, and for the first time a feeling of dread touched\r\nher heart.  She strove to avert it, however, by considering that Frank\r\nmight have been obliged to follow the wolf farther than he expected or\r\nintended.  Then a thrill of fear passed through her breast as the\r\nthought occurred, \"What if the wolf has attacked and killed him?\"  As\r\ntime wore on, and no sound of voice or gun or bark of dog broke the\r\ndreary stillness of that gloomy place, a feeling of intense horror took\r\npossession of the child's mind, and she pictured to herself all kinds of\r\npossible evils that might have befallen her companion; while at the same\r\ntime she could not but feel how awful was her unprotected and helpless\r\ncondition.  One thought, however, comforted her, and this was that\r\nMaximus would certainly come to the hut on his return to the fort.  This\r\nrelieved her mind in regard to herself; but the very relief on that\r\npoint enabled her all the more to realise the dangers to which Frank\r\nmight be exposed without any one to render him assistance.\r\n\r\nThe morning passed away, the sun rose above the hills, and the\r\nshort-lived day drew towards its close; still Frank did not return, and\r\nthe poor child who watched so anxiously for him, after many short and\r\ntimid wanderings towards the margin of the lake, returned to the igloo\r\nwith a heart fluttering from mingled anxiety and terror.  Throwing\r\nherself on the deerskin couch, she burst into a flood of tears.  As she\r\nlay there, sobbing bitterly, she was startled by a noise outside the\r\nhut, and ere she could spring from her recumbent position, Chimo darted\r\nthrough the open doorway, with a cry between a whine and a bark, and\r\nlaid his head on Edith's lap.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! what is it, my dog?  Dear Chimo, where is Frank?\" cried the child\r\npassionately, while she embraced her favourite with feelings of mingled\r\ndelight and apprehension.  \"Is he coming, Chimo?\" she said, addressing\r\nthe dumb animal, as if she believed he understood her.  Then, rising\r\nhastily, she darted out once more, to cast a longing, expectant gaze\r\ntowards the place where she had seen her companion disappear in the\r\nmorning.  But she was again doomed to disappointment.  Meanwhile Chimo's\r\nconduct struck her as being very strange.  Instead of receiving with his\r\nusual quiet satisfaction the caresses she heaped upon him, he kept up a\r\ncontinual whine, and ran about hither and thither without any apparent\r\nobject in view.  Once or twice he darted off with a long melancholy howl\r\ntowards the hills; then stopping short suddenly, stood still and looked\r\nround towards his young mistress.  At first Edith thought that the dog\r\nmust have lost his master, and had come back to the hut expecting to\r\nfind him there.  Then she called him to her and examined his mouth,\r\nexpecting and dreading to find blood upon it.  But there were no signs\r\nof his having been engaged in fighting with wolves; so Edith felt sure\r\nthat Frank must be safe from _them_ at least, as she knew that Chimo was\r\ntoo brave to have left his master to perish alone.  The dog submitted\r\nwith much impatience to this examination, and at last broke away from\r\nEdith and ran yelping towards the hills again, stopping as before, and\r\nlooking back.\r\n\r\nThe resolute manner with which Chimo did this, and the frequency of its\r\nrecurrence, at length induced Edith to believe that the animal wished\r\nher to follow him.  Instantly it occurred that he might conduct her to\r\nFrank; so without bestowing a thought on the danger of her forsaking the\r\nigloo, she ran in for her snow-shoes, and putting on her hood and thick\r\nmittens, followed the dog to the margin of the lake.  Chime's impatience\r\nseemed to subside immediately, and he trotted rapidly towards the ravine\r\ninto which Frank had entered in pursuit of the wolf that morning.  The\r\ndog paused ever and anon as they proceeded, in order to give the child\r\ntime to come up with him; and so eager was Edith in her adventure, and\r\nso hopeful was she that it would terminate in her finding Frank, that\r\nshe pressed forward at a rate which would have been utterly impossible\r\nunder less exciting circumstances.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the ravine she found the remains of the wolf which had\r\nbeen caught in the snow-trap that morning.  Frank had merely pulled it\r\nout and cast it on the snow in passing, and the torn fragments and\r\nscattered bones of the animal showed that its comrades had breakfasted\r\noff its carcass after Frank had passed.  Here Edith paused to put on her\r\nsnow-shoes, for the snow in the ravine was soft, being less exposed to\r\nthe hardening action of the wind; and the dog sat down to wait patiently\r\nuntil she was ready.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Chimo, go forward, my good dog.  I will follow you without fear,\"\r\nshe said, when the lines were properly fastened to her feet.\r\n\r\nChimo waited no second command, but threaded his way rapidly up the\r\nravine among the stunted willow bushes.  In doing so he had frequent\r\noccasion to wait for his young mistress, whose strength was rapidly\r\nfailing under the unwonted exertion she forced herself to make.  At\r\ntimes she had to pause for breath, and as she cast her eyes upwards and\r\naround at the dreary desolation of the rugged precipices which\r\neverywhere met her view, she could with difficulty refrain from shedding\r\ntears.  But Edith's heart was warm and brave.  The thought of Frank\r\nbeing in some mysterious, unknown danger, infused new energy into her\r\nsoul and strengthened her slight frame.  Having now recovered somewhat\r\nfrom the nervous haste which urged her to travel at a rate much beyond\r\nher capacity, she advanced into the ravines of the mountains with more\r\nof that steady, regular tramp which practice in the use of her\r\nsnow-shoes had taught her to assume; so that, being of a robust\r\nconstitution naturally, she became stronger and more able for her\r\nundertaking as she advanced.\r\n\r\nFor nearly two hours Chimo led Edith into the midst of the mountains.\r\nThe scenery became, if possible, more savage as they proceeded, and at\r\nlength grew so rugged and full of precipices and dark gorges, or rather\r\n_splits_ in the hills, that Edith had much difficulty in avoiding the\r\ndanger of falling over many of the latter, which were partially\r\nconcealed by, and in some places entirely covered over with, a crust of\r\nsnow.  Fortunately, as daylight waned, a brilliant galaxy of stars shone\r\nforth, enabling her to pick her steps.\r\n\r\nHitherto they had followed Frank's snow-shoe track undeviatingly, but\r\nnear the top of a cliff Chimo suddenly diverged to the left, and led his\r\nmistress by a steep and tortuous natural path to the bottom.  Here he\r\nran quickly forward, uttering a low whine or whimper, and disappeared\r\nround the corner of the precipice.  Hastening after the dog with a\r\nbeating heart, Edith speedily gained the projection of the cliff, on\r\nturning which she was startled and terrified by hearing a loud snarling\r\nbark mingled with a fierce growl.  In another moment she beheld Chimo\r\nbounding towards a gaunt savage-looking wolf, which stood close beside\r\nthe body of a man extended at full length upon the snow.\r\n\r\nAt first the wolf did not seem inclined to retreat, but the shriek which\r\nEdith uttered on suddenly beholding the scene before her induced him to\r\nturn tail and fly.  In another moment the terrified child sank exhausted\r\non the snow beside the insensible form of Frank Morton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nEDITH BECOMES A HEROINE INDEED.\r\n\r\nThe shock which Edith received on beholding the bloodstained countenance\r\nof her companion completely paralysed her at first, but only for a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of certainty that Frank would perish if assistance were not\r\nrendered tended to restore her scattered faculties, and nerve her heart\r\nfor the duties now required of her; and she rose with a feeling of\r\ndetermination to save her companion or die beside him.  Pour child! she\r\nlittle knew the extent of her own feebleness at that moment; but she\r\nbreathed an inward prayer to Him who can, and often does, achieve the\r\nmightiest results by the feeblest means.\r\n\r\nRaising Frank's head from the snow, she placed it in her lap, and with\r\nher handkerchief removed the blood from his forehead.  In doing this she\r\nobserved, to her inexpressible relief, that he breathed freely, and\r\nseemed rather to be in a state of stupor than insensibility.  The place\r\nwhere he lay was a dark rent or split in the mountain, the precipices of\r\nwhich rose on either side to a height of between thirty and forty feet.\r\nThe top of this chasm was entirely covered over with a crust of snow,\r\nthrough which there was a large gap immediately above the spot where\r\nFrank lay, revealing at once the cause of his present sad condition.  He\r\nhad evidently been crossing the ravine by means of the deceptive\r\nplatform of snow, unaware of the danger of his position, and had been\r\nsuddenly precipitated to the bottom.  In descending, his head had struck\r\nthe side of the cliff, which cut it severely; but the softness of the\r\nsnow into which he fell saved him from further injury, except the\r\nstunning effect of the fall.  How long he had lain in this state Edith\r\nhad no means of knowing, but it must have been a considerable time, as\r\nChimo could not have left him until after his fall.  Fortunately the\r\nwolf had not touched him, and the wound in his head did not appear to be\r\nvery deep.  Observing that parts of his face were slightly frostbitten,\r\nEdith commenced to rub them vigorously, at the same time calling upon\r\nhim in the most earnest tones to speak to her.  The effect of this\r\nroused him a little.  In a few minutes he opened his eyes, and gazed\r\nlanguidly into the child's face.\r\n\r\n\"Where am I, Eda?\" he said faintly, while a gentle smile played about\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n\"You are in the mountains, Frank.  Dear Frank! do open your eyes again.\r\nI'm so glad to hear your voice!  Are you better now?\"\r\n\r\nThe sound of his voice attracted Chimo, who had long ago abandoned the\r\npursuit of the wolf, and was seated beside his master.  Rising, he\r\nplaced his cold nose on Frank's cheek.  The action seemed to rouse him\r\nto the recollection of recent events.  Starting up on his knees, with an\r\nangry shout, Frank seized the gun that lay beside him and raised it as\r\nif to strike the dog; but he instantly let the weapon fall, and\r\nexclaiming, \"Ah, Chimo, is it you, good dog?\" he fell back again into\r\nthe arms of his companion.\r\n\r\nEdith wept bitterly for a few minutes, while she tried in vain to awaken\r\nher companion from his state of lethargy.  At length she dried her tears\r\nhastily, and, rising, placed Frank's head on her warm cloak, which she\r\nwrapped round his face and shoulders.  Then she felt his hands, which,\r\nthough covered with thick leather mittens, were very cold.  Making Chimo\r\ncouch at his feet, so as to imbue them with some of his own warmth, she\r\nproceeded to rub his hands, and to squeeze and, as it were, shampoo his\r\nbody all over, as vigorously as her strength enabled her.  In a few\r\nminutes the effect of this was apparent.  Frank raised himself on his\r\nelbow and gazed wildly round him.\r\n\r\n\"Surely I must have fallen.  Where am I, Edith?\"  Gradually his\r\nfaculties returned.  \"Edith, Edith!\" he exclaimed, in a low, anxious\r\nvoice, \"I must get back to the igloo.  I shall freeze here.  Fasten the\r\nlines of my snowshoes, dear, and I will rise.\"\r\n\r\nEdith did as she was desired, and immediately Frank made a violent\r\neffort and stood upright; but he swayed to and fro like a drunken man.\r\n\r\n\"Let me lean on your shoulder, dear Eda,\" he said in a faint voice.  \"My\r\nhead is terribly confused.  Lead me; I cannot see well.\"\r\n\r\nThe child placed his hand on her shoulder, and they went forward a few\r\npaces together--Edith bending beneath the heavy weight of her companion.\r\n\r\n\"Do I lean heavily?\" said Frank, drawing his hand across his forehead.\r\n\"Poor child!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he removed his hand from her shoulder; but the instant he\r\ndid so, he staggered and fell with a deep groan.\r\n\r\n\"O Frank! dear Frank! why did you do that?\" said Edith, anxiously.  \"You\r\ndo not hurt me.  I don't mind it.  Do try to rise again.\"\r\n\r\nFrank tried, and succeeded in walking in a sort of half-sleeping,\r\nhalf-waking condition for about a mile--stumbling as he went, and often\r\nunwittingly crushing his little guide to the ground.  After this he fell\r\nonce more, and could not again recover his upright position.  Poor Edith\r\nnow began to lose heart.  The utter hopelessness of getting the wounded\r\nman to advance more than a few yards at a time, and her own gradually\r\nincreasing weakness, induced the tears once more to start to her eyes.\r\nShe observed, too, that Frank was sinking into that state of lethargy\r\nwhich is so dangerous in cold climates, and she had much difficulty in\r\npreventing him from falling into that sleep which, if indulged in, is\r\nindeed the sleep of death.  By persevering, however, she succeeded in\r\nrousing him so far as to creep a short distance, now and then, on his\r\nhands and knees--sometimes to stagger a few paces forward; and at\r\nlength, long after the cold moon had arisen on the scene, they reached\r\nthe margin of the lake.\r\n\r\nHere Frank became utterly powerless, and no exertion on the part of his\r\ncompanion could avail to rouse him.  In this dilemma, Edith once more\r\nwrapped him in her warm cloak, and causing Chimo to lie at his feet,\r\nhastened over the ice towards the igloo.  On arriving she lighted the\r\nlamp and heated the tea which she had made in the morning.  This took at\r\nleast a quarter of an hour to do, and during the interval she\r\nendeavoured to allay her impatience by packing up a few mouthfuls of\r\npemmican and biscuit.  Then she spread the deerskins out on the couch;\r\nand when this was done, the tea was thoroughly heated.  The snow on the\r\nriver being quite hard, she needed not to encumber herself with\r\nsnow-shoes; but she fastened the traces of her own little sledge over\r\nher shoulders, and, with the kettle in her hand, ran as fast as her feet\r\ncould carry her to the place where she had left Frank and Chimo, and\r\nfound them lying exactly as they lay when she left them.\r\n\r\n\"Frank!  Frank! here is some hot tea for you.  Do try to take some.\"\r\n\r\nBut Frank did not move, so she had recourse to rubbing him again, and\r\nhad soon the satisfaction of seeing him open his eyes.  The instant he\r\ndid so, she repeated her earnest entreaties that he would take some tea.\r\nIn a few minutes he revived sufficiently to sit up and sip a little of\r\nthe warm beverage.  The effect was almost magical.  The blood began to\r\ncourse more rapidly through his benumbed limbs, and in five minutes more\r\nhe was able to sit up and talk to his companion.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Frank,\" said Edith, with an amount of decision that in other\r\ncircumstances would have seemed quite laughable, \"try to get on to my\r\nsled, and I'll help you.  The igloo is near at hand now.\"\r\n\r\nFrank obeyed almost mechanically, and creeping upon the sled with\r\ndifficulty, he fell instantly into a profound sleep.  Edith's chief\r\nanxiety was past now.  Harnessing Chimo to the sled as well as she\r\ncould, she ran on before, and a very few minutes brought them to the\r\nsnow-hut.  Here the work of rousing Frank had again to be accomplished;\r\nbut the vigour which the warm tea had infused into his frame rendered it\r\nless difficult than heretofore, and soon afterwards Edith had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing her companion extended on his deerskin couch,\r\nunder the sheltering roof of the igloo.  Replenishing the lamp and\r\nclosing the doorway with a slab of snow, she sat down to watch by his\r\nside.  Chimo coiled himself quietly up at his feet; while Frank, under\r\nthe influence of the grateful warmth, fell again into a deep slumber.\r\nAs the night wore on, Edith's eyes became heavy, and she too, resting\r\nher head on the deerskins, slept till the lamp on the snow-shelf expired\r\nand left the hut and its inmates in total darkness.\r\n\r\nContrary to Edith's expectations, Frank was very little better when he\r\nawoke next day; but he was able to talk to her in a faint voice, and to\r\nrelate how he had fallen over the cliff, and how afterwards he had to\r\nexert his failing powers in order to defend himself from a wolf.  In all\r\nthese conversations his mind seemed to wander a little, and it was\r\nevident that he had not recovered from the effects of the blow received\r\non his head in the fall.  For two days the child tended him with the\r\naffectionate tenderness of a sister, but as he seemed to grow worse\r\ninstead of better, she became very uneasy, and pondered much in her mind\r\nwhat she should do.  At last she formed a strange resolution.  Supposing\r\nthat Maximus must still be at the Esquimau village at the mouth of False\r\nRiver, and concluding hastily that this village could not be very far\r\naway, she determined to set out in search of it, believing that, if she\r\nfound it, the Esquimau would convey her back to the igloo on the lake,\r\nand take Frank up to Fort Chimo, where he could be properly tended and\r\nreceive medicine.\r\n\r\nFreaks and fancies are peculiar to children, but the carrying of their\r\nfreaks and fancies into effect is peculiar only to those who are\r\nprecocious and daring in character.  Such was Edith, and no sooner had\r\nshe conceived the idea of attempting to find the Esquimau camp than she\r\nproceeded to put it in execution.  Frank was in so depressed a condition\r\nthat she thought it better not to disturb or annoy him by arousing him\r\nso as to get him to comprehend what she was about to do; so she was\r\nobliged to commune with herself, sometimes even in an audible tone, in\r\ndefault of any better counsellor.  It is due to her to say that, in\r\nremembrance of her mother's advice, she sought the guidance of her\r\nheavenly Father.\r\n\r\nLong and earnest was the thought bestowed by this little child on the\r\nsubject ere she ventured to leave her companion alone in the snow-hut.\r\nFrank was able to sit up and to assist himself to the articles of food\r\nand drink which his little nurse placed within his reach, so that she\r\nhad no fear of his being in want of anything during the day--or two at\r\nmost--that she expected to be absent; for in her childlike simplicity\r\nshe concluded that if Maximus could travel thither in a few hours, she\r\ncould not take much longer, especially with such a good servant as Chimo\r\nto lead the way.  Besides this, she had observed the way in which the\r\nEsquimau had set out, and Frank had often pointed out to her the\r\ndirection in which the camp lay.  She knew also that there was no danger\r\nfrom wild animals, but determined, nevertheless, to build up the door of\r\nthe igloo very firmly, lest they should venture to draw near.  She also\r\nput Frank's loaded gun in the spot where he was wont to place it, so as\r\nto be ready to his hand.\r\n\r\nHaving made all her arrangements, Edith glided noiselessly from the hut,\r\nharnessed her dog, closed the door of the snow-hut, and jumping into the\r\nfurs of her sledge, was soon far away from the mountain lake.  At first\r\nthe dog followed what she thought must be the track that Maximus had\r\ntaken, and her spirits rose when, after an hour's drive, she emerged\r\nupon a boundless plain, which she imagined must be the shores of the\r\nfrozen sea where the Esquimaux lived.  Encouraging Chimo with her voice,\r\nshe flew over the level surface of the hard frozen snow, and looked\r\nround eagerly in all directions for the expected signs of natives.\r\n\r\nBut no such signs appeared, and she began to fear that the distance was\r\ngreater than she had anticipated.  Towards the afternoon it began to\r\nsnow heavily.  There was no wind, and the snow fell in large flakes,\r\nalighting softly and without any sound.  This prevented her seeing any\r\ngreat distance, and, what was worse, rendered the ground heavy for\r\ntravelling.\r\n\r\nAt length she came to a ridge of rocks, and supposing that she might see\r\nto a greater distance from its summit, she got out of the sledge and\r\nclambered up, for the ground was too rough for the sledge to pass.  Here\r\nthe view was dreary enough--nothing but plains and hummocks of ice and\r\nsnow met her view, except in one direction, where she saw, or fancied\r\nthat she saw, a clump of willows and what appeared to be a hut in the\r\nmidst of them.  Running down the rugged declivity, she crossed the plain\r\nand reached the spot; but although the willows were there, she found no\r\nhut.  Overcome with fatigue, fear, and disappointment, she sat down on a\r\nwreath of snow and wept.  But she felt that her situation was much too\r\nserious to permit of her wasting time in vain regrets, so she started up\r\nand endeavoured to retrace her steps.  This, however, was now a matter\r\nof difficulty.  The snow fell so thickly that her footsteps were almost\r\nobliterated, and she could not see ten yards before her.  After\r\nwandering about for a few minutes in uncertainty, she called aloud to\r\nChimo, hoping to hear his bark in reply.  But all was silent.\r\n\r\nChimo was not, indeed, unfaithful.  He heard the cry and responded to it\r\nin the usual way, by bounding in the direction whence it came.  His\r\nprogress, however, was suddenly arrested by the sledge, which caught\r\nupon and was jammed amongst the rocks.  Fiercely did Chimo strain and\r\nbound, but the harness was tough and the sledge immovable.  Meanwhile\r\nthe wind arose, and although it blew gently, it was sufficient to\r\nprevent Edith overhearing the whining cries of her dog.  For a time the\r\nchild lost all self-command, and rushed about she knew not whither, in\r\nthe anxious desire to find her sledge; then she stopped, and restrained\r\nthe pantings of her breath, while with both hands pressed tightly over\r\nher heart, as if she would fain stop the rapid throbbing there, she\r\nlistened long and intently.  But no sound fell upon her ear except the\r\nsighing of the cold breeze as it swept by, and no sight met her anxious\r\ngaze save the thickly falling snow-flakes.\r\n\r\nSinking on her knees, Edith buried her face in her hands and gave full\r\nvent to the pent-up emotions of her soul, as the conviction was at\r\nlength forced upon her mind that she was a lost wanderer in the midst of\r\nthat cold and dreary waste of snow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY NINE.\r\n\r\nA DARK CLOUD OF SORROW ENVELOPS FORT CHIMO.\r\n\r\nThree days after the events narrated in the last chapter the fort of the\r\nfur-traders became a place of weeping; for on the morning of that day\r\nMaximus arrived with the prostrate form of Frank Morton, whom he had\r\ndiscovered alone in the igloo on the lake, and with the dreadful news\r\nthat little Edith Stanley was nowhere to be found!\r\n\r\nIt may be more easily imagined than described the state of mind into\r\nwhich the parents of the child were thrown; but after the first burst of\r\nemotion was past, Stanley felt that a thorough and immediate search was\r\nthe only hope that remained to him of finding his little one alive.\r\nStill, when he considered the intensity of the cold to which she must\r\nhave been exposed, and the length of time which had already elapsed\r\nsince she was missed, his heart sank, and he could scarcely frame words\r\nof comfort to his prostrated partner.  Maximus had examined the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the lake, in the hope of finding the tracks\r\nof the lost one; but a heavy fall of snow had totally obliterated these,\r\nand he wisely judged that it would be better to convey the sick man to\r\nthe fort as quickly as possible and give the alarm, so that parties\r\nmight be sent out to scour the country in all directions.\r\n\r\nFrank was immediately put to bed on his arrival, and everything done in\r\norder to restore him.  In this attempt they succeeded so far as to\r\nobtain all the information he could give concerning his fall; but he\r\nremembered nothing further than that Edith had been the means of\r\nbringing him to the snow-hut, where he lay in a deep, torpid slumber,\r\nuntil the voice and hand of Maximus awakened him.  When Frank was told\r\nthat Edith was lost, he sprang from his bed as if he had received an\r\nelectric shock.  The confusion of his faculties seemed swept away, and\r\nhe began to put on his garments with as much vigour as if he were well\r\nand strong; but ere he belted on his leather coat his cheek grew pale,\r\nhis hand trembled, and he fell in a swoon upon the bed.  This convinced\r\nhim of the impossibility of doing anything in the search, and he was\r\nprevailed on, after two or three similar failures, to leave the work to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the mountains and valleys of Ungava were traversed far and\r\nnear by the agonised father and his men.  The neighbourhood of the lake\r\nwas the first place searched, and they had not sought long ere they\r\ndiscovered the little sledge sticking fast among the rocks of the\r\nsea-coast, and Chimo lying in the traces almost dead with cold and\r\nhunger.  The dog had kept himself alive by gnawing the deerskin of which\r\nthe traces were made.  Around this spot the search was concentrated, and\r\nthe Esquimaux of the neighbouring camp were employed in traversing the\r\ncountry in all directions; but, although scarce a foot of ground escaped\r\nthe eager scrutiny of one or other of the party, not a vestige of Edith\r\nwas to be seen--not so much as a footprint in the snow.\r\n\r\nDays and nights flew by, and still the search was continued.  Frank\r\nquickly recovered under the affectionate care of the almost heartbroken\r\nmother, who found some relief from her crushing sorrow in ministering to\r\nhis wants.  But the instant he could walk without support, and long\r\nbefore it was prudent to do so, Frank joined in the search.  At first he\r\ncould do little, but as day after day passed by his strength returned so\r\nrapidly that the only symptoms that remained to tell of his late\r\naccident were his pale cheek and the haggard expression of his\r\ncountenance.  But the mysterious disappearance of Edith had more to do\r\nwith the latter than illness.\r\n\r\nWeeks passed away, but still the dark cloud of sorrow hung over Fort\r\nChimo, for the merry young voice that was wont to awake the surrounding\r\nechoes was gone.  The systematic search had now been given up, for every\r\nnook, every glen, and gorge, and corrie within fifteen miles of the spot\r\nwhere they had found the little sledge, had been searched again and\r\nagain without success.  But hope clung with singular tenacity to the\r\nparents' hearts long after it had fled from those of the men of the fort\r\nand of the Esquimaux.  Every alternate day Stanley and Frank sallied\r\nforth with heavy steps and furrowed brows to explore more carefully\r\nthose places where the child was most likely to have strayed, expecting,\r\nyet fearing, to find her dead body.  But they always returned to the\r\nbereaved mother with silent lips and downcast looks.\r\n\r\nThey frequently conversed together about her, and always in a hopeful\r\ntone, each endeavouring to conceal from the other the real state of his\r\nown mind.  Indeed, except when necessity required it, they seldom spoke\r\non any other subject.\r\n\r\nOne day Stanley and Frank were seated by the blazing stove in the hall\r\nconversing as usual about the plan of the search for that day.  Mrs\r\nStanley was busied in preparing breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis going to blow hard from the north, Frank,\" said Stanley, rising\r\nand looking out of the window; \"I see the icebergs coming into the river\r\nwith the tide.  You will have a cold march, I fear.\"\r\n\r\nFrank made no reply, but rose and approached the window.  The view from\r\nit was a strange one.  During the night a more than usually severe frost\r\nhad congealed the water of the lake in the centre, and the icebergs that\r\nsailed towards the Caniapuscaw River in stately grandeur went crashing\r\nthrough this young ice as if it had been paper, their slow but steady\r\nprogress receiving no perceptible check from its opposition.  Some of\r\nthese bergs were of great size, and in proceeding onwards they passed so\r\nclose to the fort that the inhabitants feared more than once that a\r\nfalling pinnacle might descend on the stores, which were built near to\r\nthe water's edge, and crush them.  As the tide gradually rose it rushed\r\nwith violence into the cavities beneath the solid ice on the opposite\r\nshore, and finding no escape save through a few rents and fissures, sent\r\nup columns or spouts of white spray in all directions, which roared and\r\nshrieked as they flew upwards, as if the great ocean were maddened with\r\nanger at finding a power strong enough to restrain and curb its might.\r\nAt intervals the main ice rent with a crash like the firing of\r\nartillery; and as if nature had designed to carry on and deepen this\r\nsimile, the shore was lined with heaps of little blocks of ice which the\r\nconstantly recurring action of the tide had moulded into the shape and\r\nsize of cannon balls.\r\n\r\nBut such sights were common to the inhabitants of Fort Chimo, and had\r\nlong ago ceased to call forth more than a passing remark.\r\n\r\n\"May it not be possible,\" murmured Stanley, while he leant his brow on\r\nhis hand, \"that she may have gone up False River?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" said Frank.  \"I know not how it is, but I have a strange\r\nconviction that she is yet alive.  If she had perished in the snow, we\r\nshould certainly have found her long ago.  I cannot explain my feelings,\r\nor give a reason for them, but I feel convinced that darling Eda is\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, God grant it!\" whispered Stanley in a deep voice, while his wife\r\nhastened from the room to conceal the tears which she could not\r\nrestrain.\r\n\r\nWhile Frank continued to gaze in silence on the bleak scene without, a\r\nfaint sound of sleigh-bells broke upon his ear.\r\n\r\n\"Hark!\" he cried, starting, and opening the door.\r\n\r\nThe regular and familiar sound of the bells came floating sweetly on the\r\nbreeze.  They grew louder and louder, and in a few seconds a team of\r\ndogs galloped into the fort, dragging a small sled behind them.  They\r\nwere followed by two stalwart Indians, whose costume and manner told\r\nthat they were in the habit of associating more with the fur-traders\r\nthan with their own kindred.  The dogs ran the sled briskly into the\r\ncentre of the fort, and lay down panting on the snow, while the two men\r\napproached the hall.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a packet,\" cried Stanley, forgetting for the moment his sorrow in\r\nthe excitement of this unexpected arrival.\r\n\r\nIn a moment all the men at the fort were assembled in the square.\r\n\r\n\"A packet!  Where come you from?\"\r\n\r\n\"From Moose Fort,\" replied the elder Indian, while his comrade\r\nunfastened from the sled a little bundle containing letters.\r\n\r\n\"Any news?  Are all well?\" chorused the men.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, all well.  It is many day since we left.  The way is very rough,\r\nand we did not find much deer.  We saw one camp of Indian, but they\r\n'fraid to come.  I not know why.  But I see with them one fair flower\r\nwhich grow in the fields of the Esquimaux.  I suppose the Indian pluck\r\nher, and dare not come back here.\"\r\n\r\nStanley started, and his cheek grew pale.\r\n\r\n\"A fair flower, say you?  Speak literally, man: was it a little white\r\ngirl that you saw?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the Indian, \"it was no white girl we saw.  It was one\r\nyoung Esquimau woman.\"\r\n\r\nStanley heaved a deep sigh and turned away, muttering, \"Ah!  I might\r\nhave known that she could not have fallen into the hands of Indians so\r\nfar to the south.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, lads, take care of these fellows,\" he cried, crushing down the\r\nfeelings that had been for a brief moment awakened in his heart by the\r\nIndian's words, \"and give them plenty to eat and smoke.\"  So saying he\r\nwent off with the packet, followed by Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Niver fear ye; come along, honey,\" said Bryan, grasping the elder\r\nIndian by the arm, while the younger was carried off by Massan, and the\r\ndogs taken care of by Ma-istequan and Gaspard.\r\n\r\nOn perusing the letters, Stanley found that it would be absolutely\r\nnecessary to send a packet of dispatches to headquarters.  The\r\ndifficulties of his position required to be more thoroughly explained,\r\nand erroneous notions corrected.\r\n\r\n\"What shall I do, Frank?\" said he, with a perplexed look.  \"These\r\nIndians cannot return to Moose, having received orders, I find, to\r\njourney in a different direction.  Our own men know the way, but I\r\ncannot spare the good ones among them, and the second-rate cannot be\r\ndepended on without a leader.\"\r\n\r\nFrank did not give an immediate reply.  He seemed to be pondering the\r\nsubject in his mind.  At length he said, \"Could not Dick Prince be\r\nspared?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; he is too useful here.  The fact is, Frank, I think I must send\r\nyou.  It will do you good, my dear boy, and tend to distract your mind\r\nfrom a subject which is now hopeless.\"\r\n\r\nFrank at first objected strongly to this plan, on the ground that it\r\nwould prevent him from assisting in the forlorn search for Edith; but\r\nStanley pointed out that he and the men could continue it, and that, on\r\nthe other hand, his (Frank's) personal presence at headquarters would be\r\nof great importance to the interests of the Company.  At length Frank\r\nwas constrained to obey.\r\n\r\nThe route by which he purposed to travel was overland to Richmond Gulf\r\non snow-shoes; and as the way was rough, he determined to take only a\r\nfew days' provisions, and depend for subsistence on the hook and gun.\r\nMaximus, Oolibuck, and Ma-istequan were chosen to accompany him; and\r\nthree better men he could not have had, for they were stalwart and\r\nbrave, and accustomed from infancy to live by the chase, and traverse\r\ntrackless wastes, guided solely by that power of observation or instinct\r\nwith which savages are usually gifted.\r\n\r\nWith these men, a week's provisions, a large supply of ammunition, a\r\nsmall sledge, and three dogs, of whom Chimo was the leader, Frank one\r\nmorning ascended the rocky platform behind the fort, and bidding adieu\r\nto Ungava, commenced his long journey over the interior of East Main.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY.\r\n\r\nAN OLD FRIEND AMID NEW FRIENDS AND NOVELTIES--A DESPERATE BATTLE AND A\r\nGLORIOUS VICTORY.\r\n\r\nThe scene of our story is now changed, and we request our patient reader\r\nto fly away with us deeper into the north, beyond the regions of Ungava,\r\nand far out upon the frozen sea.\r\n\r\nHere is an island which for many long years has formed a refuge to the\r\nroedeer during the winter, at which season these animals, having\r\nforsaken the mainland in autumn, dwell upon the islands of the sea.  At\r\nthe time of which we write the island in question was occupied by a\r\ntribe of Esquimaux, who had built themselves as curious a village as one\r\ncould wish to see.  The island had little or no wood on it, and the few\r\nwillow bushes that showed their heads above the deep snow were stunted\r\nand thin.  Such as they were, however, they, along with a ledge of rock\r\nover which the snow had drifted in a huge mound, formed a sort of\r\nprotection to the village of the Esquimaux, and sheltered it from the\r\ncold blasts that swept over the frozen sea from the regions of the far\r\nnorth.  There were about twenty igloos in the village, all of which were\r\nbuilt in the form of a dome, exactly similar to the hut constructed by\r\nMaximus on the lake.  They were of various sizes, and while some stood\r\napart with only a small igloo attached, others were congregated in\r\ngroups and connected by low tunnels or passages.  The doorways leading\r\ninto most of them were so low that the natives were obliged to creep out\r\nand in on their hands and knees; but the huts themselves were high\r\nenough to permit the tallest man of the tribe to stand erect, and some\r\nof them so capacious that a family of six or eight persons could dwell\r\nin them easily.  We may remark, however, that Esquimau ideas of\r\nroominess and comfort in their dwellings differ very considerably from\r\nours.  Their chief aim is to create heat, and for this end they\r\ncheerfully submit to what we would consider the discomfort of crowding\r\nand close air.\r\n\r\nThe village at a little distance bore a curious resemblance to a cluster\r\nof white beehives; and the round, soft, hairy natives, creeping out and\r\nin continually, and moving about amongst them, were not unlike (with the\r\naid of a little imagination) to a swarm of monstrous black bees--an idea\r\nwhich was further strengthened by the continuous hum that floated on the\r\nair over the busy settlement.  Kayaks and oomiaks lay about in several\r\nplaces supported on blocks of ice, and seal-spears, paddles, dans,\r\nlances, coils of walrus-line, and other implements, were intermingled in\r\nrare confusion with sledges, sealskins, junks of raw meat and bones, on\r\nwhich latter the numerous dogs of the tribe were earnestly engaged.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this village stood a hut which differed considerably\r\nfrom those around.  It was built of clear ice instead of snow.  There\r\nwere one or two other igloos made of the same material, but none so\r\nlarge, clean, or elegant as this one.  The walls, which were\r\nperpendicular, were composed of about thirty large square blocks,\r\ncemented together with snow, and arranged in the form of an octagon.\r\nThe roof was a dome of snow.  A small porch or passage, also of ice,\r\nstood in front of the low doorway, which had been made high enough to\r\npermit the owner of the mansion to enter by stooping slightly.  In front\r\nand all around this hut the snow was carefully scraped, and all\r\noffensive objects--such as seal and whale blubber--removed, giving to it\r\nan appearance of cleanliness and comfort which the neighbouring igloos\r\ndid not possess.  Inside of this icy residence, on a couch of deerskin\r\nwas seated Edith Stanley!\r\n\r\nOn that terrible night when the child lost her way in the dreary plain,\r\nshe had wandered she knew not whither, until she was suddenly arrested\r\nby coming to the edge of the solid ice on the shores of Ungava Bay.\r\nHere the high winds had broken up the ice, and the black waters of the\r\nsea now rolled at her feet and checked her progress.  Terrified at this\r\nunexpected sight, Edith endeavoured to retrace her steps; but she found\r\nto her horror that the ice on which she stood was floating, and that the\r\nwind, having shifted a point to the eastward, was driving it across to\r\nthe west side of the bay.  Here, in the course of the next day, it\r\ngrounded, and the poor child, benumbed with cold and faint with hunger,\r\ncrept as far as she could on to the firm land, and then lay down, as she\r\nthought, to die.\r\n\r\nBut it was otherwise ordained.  In less than half an hour afterwards she\r\nwas found by a party of Esquimaux.  These wild creatures had come from\r\nthe eastward in their dog-sledges, and having passed well out to the\r\nseaward in order to avoid the open water off the mouth of False River,\r\nhad missed seeing their countrymen there, and therefore knew nothing of\r\nthe establishment of Fort Chimo.  In bending towards the land again\r\nafter passing the bay they came upon Edith's tracks, and after a short\r\nsearch they found her lying on the snow.\r\n\r\nWords cannot convey an adequate impression of the unutterable amazement\r\nof these poor creatures as they beheld the fair child, so unlike\r\nanything they had ever seen or imagined; but whatever may have been\r\ntheir thoughts regarding her, they had sense enough to see that she was\r\ncomposed of flesh and blood, and would infallibly freeze if allowed to\r\nlie there much longer.  They therefore lifted her gently upon one of the\r\nlarge sleighs, and placed her on a pile of furs in the midst of a group\r\nof women and children, who covered her up and chafed her limbs\r\nvigorously.  Meanwhile the drivers of the sledges, of which there were\r\nsix, with twenty dogs attached to each, plied their long whips\r\nenergetically; the dogs yelled in consternation, and, darting away with\r\nthe sledges as if they had been feathers, the whole tribe went hooting,\r\nyelling, and howling away over the frozen sea.\r\n\r\nThe surprise of the savages when they found Edith was scarcely, if at\r\nall, superior to that of Edith when she opened her eyes and began to\r\ncomprehend, somewhat confusedly, her peculiar position.  The savages\r\nwatched her movements, open-mouthed, with intense curiosity, and seemed\r\noverjoyed beyond expression when she at length recovered sufficiently to\r\nexclaim feebly,--\"Where am I? where are you taking me to?\"\r\n\r\nWe need scarcely add that she received no reply to her questions, for\r\nthe natives did not understand a word of her language, and with the\r\nexception of the names of one or two familiar objects, she did not\r\nunderstand a word of theirs.  Of how far or how long they travelled\r\nEdith could form no idea, as she slept profoundly during the journey,\r\nand did not thoroughly recover her strength and faculties until after\r\nher arrival at the camp.\r\n\r\nFor many days after reaching the Esquimau village poor Edith did nothing\r\nbut weep; for, besides the miserable circumstances in which she was now\r\nplaced, she was much too considerate and unselfish in her nature to\r\nforget that her parents would experience all the misery of supposing her\r\ndead, and added to this was the terrible supposition that the natives\r\ninto whose hands she had fallen might never hear of Fort Chimo.  The\r\ndistracted child did her utmost by means of signs to make them\r\nunderstand that such a place existed, but her efforts were of no avail.\r\nEither she was not eloquent in the language of signs, or the natives\r\nwere obtuse.  As time abated the first violence of her grief, she began\r\nto entertain a hope that ere long some wandering natives might convey\r\nintelligence of her to the fur-traders.  As this hope strengthened she\r\nbecame more cheerful, and resolved to make a number of little ornaments\r\nwith her name inscribed on them, which she meant to hang round the necks\r\nof the chief men of the tribe, so that should any of them ever chance to\r\nmeet with the fur-traders, these ornaments might form a clue to her\r\nstrange residence.\r\n\r\nA small medal of whalebone seemed to her the most appropriate and\r\ntractable material, but it cost her many long and weary hours to cut a\r\ncircular piece of this tough material with the help of an Esquimau\r\nknife.  When she had done it, however, several active boys who had\r\nwatched the operation with much curiosity and interest, no sooner\r\nunderstood what she wished to make than they set to work and cut several\r\nround pieces of ivory or walrus-tusk, which they presented to their\r\nlittle guest, who scratched the name EDITH on them and hung them round\r\nthe necks of the chief men of the tribe.  The Esquimaux smiled and\r\npatted the child's fair head kindly as they received this piece of\r\nattention, which they flattered themselves, no doubt, was entirely\r\ndisinterested and complimentary.\r\n\r\nWinter wore gradually away, and the ice upon the sea began to show\r\nsymptoms of decay opposite to the camp of the Esquimaux.  During the\r\nhigh winds of spring the drift had buried the village so completely that\r\nthe beehives were scarcely visible, and the big black bees walked about\r\non the top of their igloos, and had to cut deep down in order to get\r\ninto them.  For some time past the natives had been unsuccessful in\r\ntheir seal-hunting; and as seals and walruses constituted their chief\r\nmeans of support, they were reduced to short allowance.  Edith's\r\nportion, however, had never yet been curtailed.  It was cooked for her\r\nover the stone lamp belonging to an exceedingly fat young woman whose\r\nigloo was next to that of the little stranger, and whose heart had been\r\ntouched by the child's sorrow; afterwards it was more deeply touched by\r\nher gratitude and affection.  This woman's name was Kaga, and she, with\r\nthe rest of her tribe, having been instructed carefully by Edith in the\r\npronunciation of her own name, ended in calling their little guest\r\nEeduck!  Kaga had a stout, burly husband named Annatock, who was the\r\nbest hunter in the tribe; she also had a nephew about twelve or fourteen\r\nyears old, named Peetoot, who was very fond of Edith and extremely\r\nattentive to her.  Kaga had also a baby--a mere bag of fat--to which\r\nEdith became so attached that she almost constituted herself its regular\r\nnurse; and when the weather was bad, so as to confine her to the house,\r\nshe used to take it from its mother, carry it off to her own igloo, and\r\nplay with it the whole day, much in the same way as little girls play\r\nwith dolls--with this difference, however, that she considerately\r\nrestrained herself from banging its nose against the floor or punching\r\nout its eyes!\r\n\r\nIt was a bright, clear, warm day.  Four mock suns encircled and emulated\r\nin brilliancy their great original.  The balmy air was beginning to melt\r\nthe surface of the snow, and the igloos that had stood firm for full\r\nhalf a year were gradually becoming dangerous to walk over and unsafe to\r\nsit under.  Considerable bustle prevailed in the camp, for a general\r\nseal-hunting expedition was on foot, and the men of the tribe were\r\npreparing their dog-sledges and their spears.\r\n\r\nEdith was in her igloo of ice, seated on the soft pile of deerskins\r\nwhich formed her bed at night and her sofa by day, and worrying Kaga's\r\nbaby, which laughed vociferously.  The inside of this house or apartment\r\nbetokened the taste and neatness of its occupant.  The snow roof, having\r\nbegun to melt, had been removed, and was replaced by slabs of ice,\r\nwhich, with the transparent walls, admitted the sun's rays in a soft,\r\nbluish light, which cast a fairy-like charm over the interior.  On a\r\nshelf of ice which had been neatly fitted into the wall by her friend\r\nPeetoot lay a rude knife, a few pieces of whalebone and ivory (the\r\nremains of the material of which her medals had been made), and an ivory\r\ncup.  The floor was covered with willow matting, and on the raised half\r\nof it were spread several deerskins with the hair on.  A canopy of\r\nwillow boughs was erected over this.  On another shelf of ice, near the\r\nhead of the bed, stood a small stone lamp, which had been allowed to go\r\nout, the weather being warm.  The only other articles of furniture in\r\nthis simple apartment were a square table and a square stool, both made\r\nof ice blocks and covered with sealskins.\r\n\r\nWhile Edith and her living doll were in the height of their uproarious\r\nintercourse, they were interrupted by Peetoot, who burst into the room,\r\nmore like a hairy wild-man-o'-the-wood than a human being.  He carried a\r\nshort spear in one hand, and with the other pointed in the direction of\r\nthe shore, at the same time uttering a volley of unintelligible sounds\r\nwhich terminated with an emphatic \"Eeduck!\"\r\n\r\nEdith's love for conversation, whether she made herself understood or\r\nnot, had increased rather than abated in her peculiar circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Peetoot?  Why do you look so excited?  Oh dear, I wish I\r\nunderstood you--indeed I do!  But it's of no use your speaking so\r\nfast.--(Be quiet, baby darling.)--I see you want me to do or say\r\nsomething; what can it be, I wonder?\"\r\n\r\nEdith looked into the boy's face with an air of perplexity.\r\n\r\nAgain Peetoot commenced to vociferate and gesticulate violently; but\r\nseeing, as he had often seen before, that his young friend did not\r\nappear to be much enlightened, he seized her by the arm, and, as a more\r\nsummary and practical way of explaining himself, dragged her towards the\r\ndoor of the hut.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the baby!\" screamed Edith, breaking from him and placing her charge\r\nin the farthest and safest part of the couch.  \"Now I'll go with you,\r\nthough I don't understand what you want.  Well, I suppose I shall find\r\nout in time, as usual.\"\r\n\r\nHaving led Edith towards the beach, Peetoot pointed to his uncle's\r\nsledge, to which the dogs were already harnessed, and made signs that\r\nEdith should go with them.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I understand you now.  Well, it is a charming day; I think I will.\r\nDo you think Annatock will let me?  Oh, you don't understand.  Never\r\nmind; wait till I put on my hood and return the baby to its mother.\"\r\n\r\nIn two minutes Edith reappeared in her fur cloak and Indian hood, with\r\nthe fat baby sprawling and laughing on her shoulder.  That baby never\r\ncried.  It seemed as though it had resolved to substitute laughing in\r\nits stead.  Once only had Edith seen tears in its little black eyes, and\r\nthat was when she had given it a spoonful of soup so hot that its mouth\r\nwas scalded by it.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the sledges had already left the island, and were flying at\r\nfull speed over the frozen sea, deviating ever and anon from the\r\nstraight line in order to avoid a hummock of ice or a gap of open water\r\ncaused by the separation of masses at the falling of the tide, while the\r\nmen shouted, and the dogs yelled as they observed the flourish of the\r\ncruelly long and heavy lash.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I get in?\" said Edith to Annatock, with an inquiring look, as she\r\napproached the place where the sledge was standing.\r\n\r\nThe Esquimau nodded his shaggy head, and showed a row of remarkably\r\nwhite teeth environed by a thick black beard and moustache, by way of\r\nreply to the look of the child.\r\n\r\nWith a laughing nod to Kaga, who stood watching them, Edith stepped in\r\nand seated herself on a deerskin robe; Annatock and Peetoot sat down\r\nbeside her; the enormous whip gave a crack like a pistol-shot, and the\r\nteam of fifteen dogs, uttering a loud cry, bounded away over the sea.\r\n\r\nThe sledge on which Edith was seated was formed very much in the same\r\nmanner as the little sled which had been made for her at Fort Chimo.  It\r\nwas very much larger, how ever, and could have easily held eight or ten\r\npersons.  The runners, which were shod with frozen mud (a substance that\r\nwas now becoming nearly unfit for use owing to the warm weather), were a\r\nperfect wonder of ingenuity--as, indeed, was the whole machine--being\r\npieced and lashed together with lines of raw hide in the most\r\ncomplicated manner and very neatly.  The dogs were each fastened by a\r\nseparate line to the sledge, the best dog being placed in the centre and\r\nhaving the longest line, while the others were attached by lines\r\nproportionably shorter according to the distance of each from the\r\nleading dog, and the outsiders being close to the runners of the sledge.\r\nAll the lines were attached to the front bar of the machine.  There\r\nwere many advantages attending this mode of harnessing, among which were\r\nthe readiness with which any dog could be attached or detached without\r\naffecting the others, and the ease with which Annatock, when so\r\ninclined, could lay hold of the line of a refractory dog, haul him back\r\nwithout stopping the others, and give him a cuffing.  This, however, was\r\nseldom done, as the driver could touch any member of the team with the\r\npoint of his whip.  The handle of this terrible instrument was not much\r\nmore than eighteen or twenty inches long, but the lash was upwards of\r\nsix yards!  Near the handle it was about three inches broad, being thick\r\ncords of walrus-hide platted; it gradually tapered towards the point,\r\nwhere it terminated in a fine line of the same material.  While driving,\r\nthe long lash of this whip trails on the snow behind the sledge, and by\r\na peculiar sleight of hand its serpentine coils can be brought up for\r\ninstant use.\r\n\r\nNo backwoodsman of Kentucky was ever more perfect in the use of his\r\npea-rifle or more certain of his aim than was Annatock with his\r\nmurderous whip.  He was a dead shot, so to speak.  He could spread\r\nintense alarm among the dogs by causing the heavy coil to whiz over them\r\nwithin a hair's-breadth of their heads; or he could gently touch the\r\nextreme tip of the ear of a skulker, to remind him of his duty to his\r\nmaster and his comrades; or, in the event of the warning being\r\nneglected, he could bring the point down on his flank with a crack like\r\na pistol-shot, that would cause skin and hair to fly, and spread yelping\r\ndismay among the entire pack.  And how they did run!  The sledge seemed\r\na mere feather behind the powerful team.  They sprang forth at full\r\ngallop, now bumping over a small hummock or diverging to avoid a large\r\none, anon springing across a narrow gap in the ice, or sweeping like the\r\nsnowdrift over the white plain, while the sledge sprang and swung and\r\nbounded madly on behind them; and Annatock shouted as he flourished his\r\ngreat whip in the excitement of their rapid flight, and Peetoot laughed\r\nwith wild delight, and Edith sat clasping her hands tightly over her\r\nknees--her hood thrown back, her fair hair blown straight out by the\r\nbreeze, her cheeks flushed, her lips parted, and her eyes sparkling with\r\nemotion as they whirled along in their mad and swift career.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour the low village was out of sight, and in half an hour\r\nmore they arrived at the place where a number of the Esquimaux were\r\nscattered in twos and threes over the ice, searching for seal-holes, and\r\npreparing to catch them.\r\n\r\n\"What is that man doing?\" cried Edith, pointing to an Esquimau who,\r\nhaving found a hole, had built a semicircular wall of snow round it to\r\nprotect him from the light breeze that was blowing, and was sitting,\r\nwhen Edith observed him, in the attitude of one who listened intently.\r\nThe hood of his sealskin coat was over his head, so that his features\r\nwere concealed.  At his feet lay a stout, barbed seal-spear, the handle\r\nof which was made of wood, and the barb and lower part of ivory.  A\r\ntough line was attached to this, and the other end of it was fastened\r\nround the man's waist; for when an Esquimau spears a seal, he prepares\r\nto conquer or to die.  If he does not haul the animal out of the hole,\r\nthere is every probability that it will haul him into it.  But the\r\nEsquimau has laid it down as an axiom that a man is more than a match\r\nfor a seal; therefore he ties the line round his waist,--which is very\r\nmuch like nailing the colours to the mast.  There seems to be no\r\nallowance made for the chance of an obstreperously large seal allowing\r\nhimself to be harpooned by a preposterously small Esquimau; but we\r\nsuppose that this is the exception to the rule.\r\n\r\nAs Edith gazed, the Esquimau put out his hand with the stealthy motion\r\nof a cat and lifted his spear.  The next instant the young ice that\r\ncovered the hole was smashed, and, in an instant after, the ivory barb\r\nwas deep in the shoulder of an enraged seal, which had thus fallen a\r\nsacrifice to his desire for fresh air.  The Esquimau immediately lay\r\nback almost at full length, with his heels firmly imbedded in two\r\nnotches cut in the ice at the edge of the hole; the seal dived, and the\r\nman's waist seemed to be nearly cut in two.  But the rope was tough and\r\nthe man was stout, and although the seal was both, it was conquered in\r\nthe course of a quarter of an hour, hauled out, and thrown exultingly\r\nupon the ice.\r\n\r\nThis man had only watched at the seal-hole a couple of hours, but the\r\nnatives frequently sit behind their snow walls for the greater part of a\r\nday, almost without moving hand or foot.\r\n\r\nHaving witnessed this capture, Annatock drove on until the most of his\r\ncountrymen were left behind.  Suddenly he called to the dogs to halt,\r\nand spoke in a deep, earnest tone to his nephew, while both of them\r\ngazed intently towards a particular quarter of the sea.  Edith looked in\r\nthe same direction, and soon saw the object that attracted their\r\nattention, but the only thing it seemed like to her was an enormous cask\r\nor barrel.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said she to Peetoot, as Annatock selected his largest\r\nspear and hastened towards the object.\r\n\r\nOf course Edith received no reply save a broad grin; but the little\r\nfellow followed up this remark, if we may so call it, by drawing his\r\nfingers through his lips, and licking them in a most significant manner.\r\nMeanwhile Annatock advanced rapidly towards the object of interest,\r\nkeeping carefully behind hummocks of ice as he went, and soon drew near\r\nenough to make certain that it was a walrus, apparently sound asleep,\r\nwith its blunt snout close to its hole, ready to plunge in should an\r\nenemy appear.\r\n\r\nAnnatock now advanced more cautiously, and when within a hundred yards\r\nof the huge monster, lay down at full length on his breast, and began to\r\nwork his way towards it after the manner of a seal.  He was so like a\r\nseal in his hairy garments that he might easily have been mistaken for\r\none by a more intellectual animal than a walrus.  But the walrus did not\r\nawake, and he approached to within ten yards.  Then, rising suddenly to\r\nhis feet, Annatock poised the heavy weapon, and threw it with full force\r\nagainst the animal's side.  It struck, and, as if it had fallen on an\r\nadamantine rock, it bounded off and fell upon the ice, with its hard\r\npoint shattered and its handle broken in two.\r\n\r\nFor one instant Annatock's face blazed with surprise; the next, it\r\nrelapsed into fifty dimples, as he roared and tossed up his arms with\r\ndelight at the discovery that the walrus had been frozen to death beside\r\nits hole!\r\n\r\nThis catastrophe is not of unfrequent occurrence to these _elephants_ of\r\nthe northern seas.  They are in the habit of coming up occasionally\r\nthrough their holes in the ice to breathe, and sometimes they crawl out\r\nin order to sleep on the ice, secure, in the protection of their\r\nsuperabundant fat, from being frozen--at least easily.  When they have\r\nhad enough of sleep, or when the prickling sensation on their skin warns\r\nthem that nothing is proof against the cold of the Polar Seas, and that\r\nthey will infallibly freeze if they do not make a precipitate retreat to\r\nthe comparatively warm waters below, they scramble to their holes, crush\r\ndown the new ice with their tusks and thick heads, and plunge in.  But\r\nsometimes the ice which forms on the holes when they are asleep is too\r\nstrong to be thus broken, in which case the hapless monster lays him\r\ndown and dies.\r\n\r\nSuch was the fate of the walrus which Annatock was now cutting up with\r\nhis axe into portable blocks of beef.  For several days previous to the\r\nthaw which had now set in, the weather had been intensely cold, and the\r\nwalrus had perished in consequence of its ambitious desire to repose in\r\nthe regions above.\r\n\r\nNot far from the spot where this fortunate discovery had been made,\r\nthere was a large sheet of recently-formed black ice, where the main ice\r\nhad been broken away and the open water left.  The sheet, although much\r\nmelted by the thaw, was still about three inches thick, and quite\r\ncapable of supporting a man.  While Annatock was working with his back\r\nto this ice, he heard a tremendous crash take place behind him.  Turning\r\nhastily round, he observed that the noise was caused by another enormous\r\nwalrus, the glance of whose large round eyes and whose loud snort showed\r\nclearly enough that he was not frozen like his unfortunate companion.\r\nBy this time the little boy had come up with Edith and the sledge.  So\r\nAnnatock ordered him to take the dogs behind a hummock to keep them out\r\nof sight, while he selected several strong harpoons and a lance from the\r\nsledge.  Giving another lance to Peetoot, he signed to Edith to sit on\r\nthe hummock while he attacked the grisly monster of the deep.\r\n\r\nWhile these preparations were being made, the walrus dived; and while it\r\nwas under water, the man and the boy ran quickly forward a short\r\ndistance, and then lay down behind a lump of ice.  Scarcely had they\r\ndone so when the walrus came up again with a loud snort, splashing the\r\nwater with its broad, heavy flippers--which seemed a sort of compromise\r\nbetween legs and fins--and dashing waves over the ice as it rolled about\r\nits large, unwieldy carcass.  It was truly a savage-looking monster, as\r\nlarge as a small elephant, and having two tusks of a foot and a half\r\nlong.  The face bore a horrible resemblance to that of a man.  Its crown\r\nwas round and bulging, its face broad and massive, and a thick,\r\nbristling moustache--rough as the spines of a porcupine--covered its\r\nupper lip, and depended in a shaggy dripping mass over its mouth.  After\r\nspluttering about a short time it dived again.\r\n\r\nNow was Annatock's time.  Seizing a harpoon and a coil of line, he\r\nmuttered a few words to the boy, sprang up, and running out upon the\r\nsmooth ice, stood by the edge of the open water.  He had not waited here\r\nmore than a few seconds when the black waters were cleft by the blacker\r\nhead of the monster, as it once more ascended to renew its elephantine\r\ngambols in the pool.  As it rose, the Esquimau threw up his arm and\r\npoised the harpoon.  For one instant the surprised animal raised itself\r\nbreast-high out of the water, and directed a stare of intense\r\nastonishment at the man.  That moment was fatal.  Annatock buried the\r\nharpoon deep under its left flipper.  With a fierce bellow the brute\r\ndashed itself against the ice, endeavouring in its fury to reach its\r\nassailant; but the ice gave way under its enormous weight, while\r\nAnnatock ran back as far as the line attached to the harpoon would\r\npermit him.\r\n\r\nThe walrus, seeing that it could not reach its enemy in this way, seemed\r\nnow to be actually endued with reason.  It took a long gaze at Annatock,\r\nand then dived.  But the Esquimau was prepared for this.  He changed his\r\nposition hastily, and played his line the meanwhile, fixing the point of\r\nhis lance into the ice, in order to give him a more effective hold.\r\nScarcely had he done so than the spot he had just left was smashed up,\r\nand the head of the walrus appeared, grinning and bellowing as if in\r\ndisappointment.  At this moment Peetoot handed his uncle a harpoon, and,\r\nere the animal dived, the weapon was fixed in his side.  Once more\r\nAnnatock changed his position; and once again the spot on which he had\r\nbeen standing was burst upwards.  It was a terrible sight to see that\r\nunearthly-looking monster smashing the ice around it, and lashing the\r\nblood-stained sea into foam, while it waged such mortal war with the\r\nself-possessed and wary man.  How mighty and strong the one! how\r\ncomparatively weak and seemingly helpless the other!  It was the triumph\r\nof mind over matter--of reason over blind brute force.  But Annatock\r\nfought a hard battle that day ere he came off conqueror.  Harpoon after\r\nharpoon was driven into the walrus; again and again the lance pierced\r\ndeep into its side and drank its life-blood; but three hours had passed\r\naway before the dead carcass was dragged from the deep by the united\r\nforce of dogs and man.  During this terrible combat Edith had looked on\r\nwith such intense interest that she could scarcely believe her eyes when\r\nshe found, from the position of the sun, that the day was far advanced.\r\nIt was too late now to think of cutting up the carcasses without\r\nassistance, so Annatock determined to return home and tell his\r\ncountrymen of his good fortune.\r\n\r\nIt is a custom among the Esquimaux to consider every animal that is\r\nkilled as the common property of all--the successful hunter being\r\nentitled to all the titbits, besides his portion of the equal dividend;\r\nso that Annatock knew he had only to give the signal, and every\r\nable-bodied man in the village, and not a few of the women and children,\r\nwould descend like vultures on the spoil.  Jumping into his sledge, he\r\nstretched out his exhausted frame at full length beside Edith, and\r\ncommitted the whip to Peetoot.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so glad,\" cried Edith, with a beaming face, \"that we have killed\r\nthis beast.  The poor people will have plenty to eat now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha! _ha_!\" roared Peetoot, giving increased emphasis to each\r\nsuccessive shout, and prolonging the last into a yell of delight, as he\r\ncracked the ponderous whip from side to side like a volley of pistolry.\r\n\r\n\"O Peetoot!\" exclaimed Edith, in a remonstrative tone, as the sledge\r\nswayed to and fro with the rate at which they were sweeping over the\r\nplain, \"don't drive so fast; you will kill the poor dogs!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho! ho! _ho-o-o_!  Eeduck!\" roared the boy, aiming a shot at the\r\nleader's left ear, and bringing the thick end of the whip down on the\r\nflanks of the six hindmost dogs.\r\n\r\nThus, amid a volley of roars, remonstrances, yells, yelps, and pistolry,\r\nEdith and her friends scoured over the frozen sea, and swept into the\r\nEsquimau camp like a whirlwind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY ONE.\r\n\r\nANOTHER DESPERATE BATTLE, AND A DECIDED VICTORY--THE ESQUIMAUX SUFFER A\r\nSEVERE LOSS.\r\n\r\nThe night that followed the day of which we have given an account in the\r\nlast chapter was a night of rest to Edith, but not to the Esquimaux.\r\n\r\nScarcely allowing themselves time to harness their dogs, after the news\r\nreached them, they set off for the scene of action in a body.  Every\r\nsledge was engaged, every able-bodied male and female started.  None\r\nwere left in camp except the sick, of whom there were few; and the aged,\r\nof whom there were fewer.  While engaged in the hurried preparations for\r\ndeparture the women sang with delight, for they had been living on very\r\nshort allowance for some weeks past, and starvation had been threatening\r\nthem; so that the present success diffused among these poor creatures a\r\nuniversal feeling of joy.  But their preparations were not numerous.  A\r\nshort scene of excited bustle followed Annatock's arrival, a few yells\r\nfrom the dogs at starting, and the deserted camp was so silent and\r\ndesolate that it seemed as if human beings had not been there for\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nIt did not continue long, however, in this state.  Two or three hours\r\nlater, and the first of the return parties arrived, groaning under the\r\nburdens they carried and dragged behind them.  The walrus-flesh was\r\npacked on the dog-sledges; but as for the few seals that had been\r\ncaught, they were sledges to themselves--cords being tied to their\r\ntails, to which a dozen natives attached themselves, and dragged the\r\ncarcasses over the snow.\r\n\r\nPeetoot, whose spirit that night seemed to be intoxicated with success,\r\nand who felt that he was the lion of the night (after Annatock!), seated\r\nhimself astride of one of the dead seals, and was dragged into camp on\r\nthis novel sledge, shouting a volley of unintelligible jargon at the top\r\nof his voice, in the midst of which \"Eeduck\" frequently resounded.  At\r\nlength the last lingerer arrived, and then began a feast of the most\r\nextraordinary kind.  The walrus-flesh was first conveyed to the igloo of\r\nAnnatock, where it was cut up and distributed among the natives.  The\r\nwomen seemed quite frantic with joy, and went about from hut to hut\r\nembracing one another, by way of congratulation.  Soon the lamps of the\r\nvillage were swimming with oil, the steaks stewing and roasting, the\r\nchildren provided with pieces of raw blubber to keep them quiet while\r\nthe larger portions were being cooked, and the entire community\r\ngormandising and rejoicing as savages are wont to do when suddenly\r\nvisited with plenty in the midst of starvation.\r\n\r\nDuring all this scene, Edith went about from hut to hut enjoying\r\nherself.  Nay, reader, be not horrified; thou knowest not the pliable\r\nand accommodating nature of humanity.  Edith did not enjoy the filth by\r\nwhich she was surrounded--far from it; neither did she enjoy the sight\r\nof raw blubber being sucked by little babies, especially by her own\r\nfavourite; but she _did_ enjoy the sight of so much plenty where, but a\r\nfew hours ago, starvation had begun to threaten a visit; and she did\r\nenjoy and heartily sympathise with the undoubted and great happiness of\r\nher hospitable friends.  A very savoury dish, with a due proportion of\r\nlean to the fat, cut specially to suit her taste, smoked on Eeduck's\r\ntable that night, and Peetoot and the baby helped her to eat it.  Really\r\nit would be a matter of nice calculation to ascertain whether Peetoot or\r\nthe baby laughed most on this jovial occasion.  Undoubtedly the former\r\nhad the best of it in regard to mere noise; nevertheless the pipe of the\r\nlatter was uncommonly shrill, and at times remarkably racy and\r\nobstreperous.  But as the hours flew by, the children throughout the\r\ncamp generally fell asleep, while their seniors sat quietly and\r\ncontentedly round their kettles and lamps, eating and slumbering by\r\nturns.  The amount of food consumed was enormous, and quite beyond the\r\nbelief of men accustomed to the appetites of temperate zones; but we beg\r\nthem to remember that arctic frosts require to be met with arctic\r\nstimulants, and of these an immense quantity of unctuous food is the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nNext morning the Esquimaux were up and away by daybreak, with their dogs\r\nand sledges, to bring home the remainder of the walrus-meat; for these\r\npoor people are not naturally improvident, and do not idle their time in\r\nluxurious indolence until necessity urges them forth again in search of\r\nfood.  In this respect they are superior to Indians, who are notoriously\r\nimprovident and regardless of the morrow.\r\n\r\nThis day was signalised by another piece of success on the part of\r\nAnnatock and his nephew, who went to the scene of yesterday's battle on\r\nfoot.  Edith remained behind, having resolved to devote herself entirely\r\nto the baby, to make up for her neglect of the previous day.  On\r\nreaching the place where the walrus had been slain, Annatock cut off and\r\nbound up a portion with which he intended to return to the camp.  While\r\nhe was thus employed, along with a dozen or more of his countrymen,\r\nPeetoot came running towards him, saying that he thought he saw a seal\r\nlying on the ice far ahead.  Having a harpoon and two spears with them,\r\nAnnatock left his work and followed his nephew to the spot where it was\r\nsupposed to be lying.  But on reaching the place they found that it was\r\ngone, and a few bells floating at the surface of the hole showed where\r\nit had made its descent to the element below.  With the characteristic\r\nindifference of a man accustomed to the vicissitudes and the\r\ndisappointments of a hunter's life, the elder Esquimau uttered a grunt\r\nand turned away.  But he had not proceeded more than a few paces when\r\nhis eye became riveted on the track of some animal on the ice, which\r\nappeared to his practised eye to be quite fresh.  Upon examination this\r\nproved to be the case, and Annatock spoke earnestly for a few minutes\r\nwith his nephew.  The boy appeared from his gestures to be making some\r\ndetermined remarks, and seemed not a little hurt at the doubting way in\r\nwhich his uncle shook his head.  At length Peetoot seized a spear, and,\r\nturning away, followed the track of the animal with a rapid and\r\ndetermined air; while Annatock, grasping the other spear, followed in\r\nthe boy's track.\r\n\r\nA brisk walk of half an hour over the ice and hummocks of the sea\r\ncarried them out of sight of their companions, but did not bring them up\r\nwith the animal of which they were in chase.  At length Peetoot halted,\r\nand stooped to scrutinise the track more attentively.  As he did so an\r\nenormous white bear stalked out from behind a neighbouring hummock of\r\nice, and after gazing at him for a second or two, turned round and\r\nwalked slowly away.\r\n\r\nThe elder Esquimau cast a doubtful glance at his nephew, while he\r\nlowered the point of his spear and seemed to hesitate; but the boy did\r\nnot wait.  Levelling his spear, he uttered a wild shout and ran towards\r\nthe animal, which instantly turned towards the approaching enemy with a\r\nlook of defiance.  If Annatock had entertained any doubts of his\r\nnephew's courage before, he had none now; so, casting aside all further\r\nthought on the subject, he ran forward along with him to attack the\r\nbear.  This was a matter attended with much danger, however, and there\r\nwas some reason in the man feeling a little uncertainty as to the\r\ncourage of a youth who, he was aware, now faced a bear for the first\r\ntime in his life!\r\n\r\nAt first the two hunters advanced side by side towards the\r\nfierce-looking monster, but as they drew near they separated, and\r\napproached one on the right, the other on the left of the bear.  As it\r\nwas determined that Annatock should give the death-wound, he went\r\ntowards the left side and hung back a moment, while Peetoot advanced to\r\nthe right.  When about three yards distant the bear rose.  The action\r\nhad a powerful and visible effect upon the boy; for as polar bears are\r\ncomparatively long-bodied and short-legged, their true proportions are\r\nnot fully displayed until they rear on their hind legs.  It seemed as if\r\nthe animal actually grew taller and more enormous in the act of rising,\r\nand the boy's cheek blanched while he shrank backwards for a moment.  It\r\nwas only for a moment, however.  A quick word of encouragement from\r\nAnnatock recalled him.  He stepped boldly forward as the bear was\r\nglancing savagely from side to side, uncertain which enemy to attack\r\nfirst, and, thrusting his lance forward, pricked it sharply on the side.\r\nThis decided the point.  With a ferocious growl the animal turned to\r\nfall upon its insignificant enemy.  In doing so its left shoulder was\r\nfully exposed to Annatock, who, with a dart like lightning, plunged his\r\nspear deep into its heart.  A powerful shudder shook the monster's frame\r\nas it fell dead upon the ice.\r\n\r\nAnnatock stood for a few minutes leaning on his spear, and regarding the\r\nbear with a grim look of satisfaction; while Peetoot laughed, and\r\nshouted, and danced around it like a maniac.  How long he would have\r\ncontinued these wild demonstrations it is difficult to say--probably\r\nuntil he was exhausted--but his uncle brought them to a speedy\r\ntermination by bringing the butt-end of his spear into smart contact\r\nwith Peetoot's flank.  With a howl, in which consternation mingled with\r\nhis glee, the boy darted away over the ice like a reindeer to convey the\r\nglad news to his friends, and to fetch a sledge for the bear's carcass.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the village there was immediately instituted another\r\nroyal feast, which continued from day to day, gradually decreasing in\r\njoyous intensity as the provender decreased in bulk, until the walruses,\r\nthe bear, and the seals were entirely consumed.\r\n\r\nSoon after this the weather became decidedly mild, and the power of the\r\nsun's rays was so great that the snow on the island and the ice on the\r\nsea began to be resolved into water.  During this period several\r\nimportant changes took place in the manners and customs of the\r\nEsquimaux.  The women, who had worn deerskin shoes during the winter,\r\nput on their enormous waterproof summer boots.  The men, when out on the\r\nice in search of seals, used a pair of wooden spectacles, with two\r\nnarrow slits to peep through, in order to protect their eyes from the\r\nsnow-blindness caused by the glare of the sun on the ice and snow--a\r\ncomplaint which is apt to attack all arctic travellers in spring if not\r\nguarded against by some such appliance as the clumsy wooden spectacles\r\nof the Esquimaux.  Active preparations were also made for the erection\r\nof skin summer tents, and the launching of kayaks and oomiaks.\r\nMoreover, little boys were forbidden to walk, as they had been wont to\r\ndo, on the tops of the snow-houses, lest they should damage the\r\nrapidly-decaying roofs; but little boys in the far north inherit that\r\ntendency to disobedience which is natural to the children of Adam the\r\nworld over, and on more than one occasion, having ventured to run over\r\nthe igloos, were caught in the act by the thrusting of a leg now and\r\nthen through the roofs thereof, to the indignation of the inmates below.\r\n\r\nA catastrophe of this sort happened to poor Peetoot not long after the\r\nslaying of the polar bear, and brought the winter camp to an abrupt\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\nEdith had been amusing herself in her house of ice all the morning with\r\nher adopted baby, and was in the act of feeding it with a choice morsel\r\nof seal-fat, partially cooked, to avoid doing violence to her own\r\nprejudices, and very much under-done in order to suit the Esquimau\r\nbaby's taste--when Peetoot rushed violently into the hut, shouted Eeduck\r\nwith a boisterous smile, seized the baby in his arms, and carried it off\r\nto its mother.  Edith was accustomed to have it thus torn from her by\r\nthe boy, who was usually sent as a messenger when Kaga happened to\r\ndesire the loan of her offspring.\r\n\r\nThe igloo in which Kaga and her relations dwelt was the largest in the\r\nvillage.  It was fully thirty feet in diameter.  The passage leading to\r\nit was a hundred yards long, by five feet wide and six feet high, and\r\nfrom this passage branched several others of various lengths, leading to\r\ndifferent storehouses and to other dwellings.  The whiteness of the snow\r\nof which this princely mansion and its offices were composed was not\r\nmuch altered on the exterior; but in the interior a long winter of\r\ncooking and stewing and general filthiness had turned the walls and\r\nroofs quite black.  Being somewhat lazy, Peetoot preferred the old plan\r\nof walking over this palace to going round by the entrance, which faced\r\nthe south.  Accordingly, he hoisted the fat and smiling infant on his\r\nshoulder, and bounded over the dome-shaped roof of Kaga's igloo.  Alas\r\nfor the result of disobedience!  No sooner had his foot touched the\r\nkey-stone of the arch than down it went.  Dinner was being cooked and\r\nconsumed by twenty people below at the time.  The key-stone buried a\r\njoint of walrus-beef, and instantly Peetoot and the baby lay sprawling\r\non the top of it.  But this was not all.  The roof, unable to support\r\nits own weight, cracked and fell in with a dire crash.  The men, women,\r\nand children struggled to disentomb themselves, and in doing so mixed up\r\nthe oil of the lamps, the soup of their kettles, the black soot of the\r\nwalls and roof, the dogs that had sneaked in, the junks of cooked,\r\nhalf-cooked, and raw blubber, and their own hairy-coated persons, into a\r\nconglomerate so atrocious to behold, or even think upon, that we are\r\nconstrained to draw a curtain over the scene and spare the reader's\r\nfeelings.  This event caused the Esquimaux to forsake the igloos, and\r\npitch their skin tents on a spot a little to the southward of their\r\nwintering ground, which, being more exposed to the sun's rays, was now\r\nfree from snow.\r\n\r\nThey had not been encamped here more than three days when an event\r\noccurred which threw the camp into deep grief for a time.  This was the\r\nloss of their great hunter, Annatock, the husband of Kaga.  One of those\r\ntremendous north-west gales, which now and then visit the arctic seas\r\nand lands with such devastating fury, had set in while Annatock was out\r\non the ice-floe in search of seals.  Many of his comrades had started\r\nwith him that day, but being a bold man, he had pushed beyond them all.\r\nWhen the gale came on the Esquimau hunters prepared to return home as\r\nfast as possible, fearing that the decaying ice might break up and drift\r\naway with them out to sea.  Before starting they were alarmed to find\r\nthat the seaward ice was actually in motion.  It was on this ice that\r\nAnnatock was employed; and his countrymen would fain have gone to warn\r\nhim of his danger, but a gap of thirty feet already separated the floe\r\nfrom the main ice, and although they could perceive their friend in the\r\nfar distance, busily employed on the ice, they could not make their\r\nvoices heard.  As the gale increased the floe drifted faster out to sea,\r\nand Annatock was observed running anxiously towards the land; but before\r\nhe reached the edge of the ice-raft on which he stood, the increasing\r\ndistance and the drifting clouds of snow hid him from view.  Then his\r\ncompanions, fearful for their own safety, hastened back to the camp with\r\nthe sad news.\r\n\r\nAt first Kaga seemed quite inconsolable, and Edith exerted herself as a\r\ncomforter without success; but as time wore on the poor woman's grief\r\nabated, and hope began to revive within her bosom.  She recollected that\r\nthe event which had befallen her husband had befallen some of her\r\nfriends before in exactly similar circumstances, and that, although on\r\nmany occasions the result had been fatal, there were not a few instances\r\nin which the lost ones had been driven on their ice-raft to distant\r\nparts of the shore, and after months, sometimes years, of hardship and\r\nsuffering, had returned to their families and homes.\r\n\r\nStill this hope was at best a poor one.  For the few instances there\r\nwere of return from such dangers, there were dozens in which the poor\r\nEsquimaux were never heard of more; and the heart of the woman sank\r\nwithin her as she thought of the terrible night on which her husband was\r\nlost, and the great, stormy, ice-laden sea, over whose surging bosom he\r\nwas drifted.  But the complex machinery of this world is set in motion\r\nand guided by One whose power and wisdom infinitely transcend those of\r\nthe most exalted of His creatures; and it is a truth well worthy of\r\nbeing reiterated and re-impressed upon our memories, that in His hands\r\nthose events that seem most adverse to man often turn out to be for his\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY TWO.\r\n\r\nEDITH WAXES MELANCHOLY, BUT HER SADNESS IS SUDDENLY TURNED INTO JOY; AND\r\nTHE ESQUIMAUX RECEIVE A SURPRISE, AND FIND A FRIEND, AND LOSE ONE.\r\n\r\nThe sea!  How many stout hearts thrill and manly bosoms swell at the\r\nsound of that little word, or rather at the thought of all that it\r\nconveys!  How many there are that reverence and love thy power and\r\nbeauty, thy freedom and majesty, O sea!  Wherein consists the potent\r\ncharm that draws mankind towards thee with such irresistible affection?\r\nIs it in the calm tranquillity of thy waters, when thou liest like a\r\nsheet of crystal, with a bright refulgent sky reflected in thy soft\r\nbosom, and the white ships resting there as if in empty space, and the\r\nglad sea-mews rippling thy surface for a brief moment and then sailing\r\nfrom the blue below to the deeper blue above, and the soft song of thy\r\nwavelets as they slide upon the shingly shore or lip among the caves and\r\nhollows of the rocks!  Or is it in the loud roar of thy billows, as they\r\ndash and fume and lash in fury on the coasts that dare to curb thy\r\nmight?--that might which, commencing, mayhap, in the torrid zone of the\r\nsouth, has rolled and leaped in majesty across the waste of waters,\r\ntossed leviathans as playthings in its strength, rushed impetuously over\r\nhalf the globe, and burst at last in helplessness upon a bed of sand!\r\nOr does the charm lie in the yet fiercer strife of the tempest and the\r\nhurricane, when the elements, let loose, sweep round the shrinking world\r\nin fury; or in the ever-changing aspect of thy countenance, now bright\r\nand fair, now ruffled with the rising breeze, or darkened by the\r\nthunder-cloud that bodes the coming storm!\r\n\r\nAh yes! methinks not one but all of these combined do constitute the\r\ncharm which draws mankind to thee, bright ocean, and fills his soul with\r\nsympathy and love.  For in the changeful aspects of thy visage there are\r\ntalismans which touch the varied chords that vibrate in the hearts of\r\nmen.  Perchance, in the bold whistle of thy winds, and the mad rolling\r\nof thy waves, an emblem of freedom is recognised by crushed and chafing\r\nspirits longing to be free.  They cannot wall thee round.  They cannot\r\nmap thee into acres and hedge thee in, and leave us naught but narrow\r\nroads between.  No ploughshare cleaves thee save the passing keel; no\r\nprince or monarch owns thy haughty waves.  In thy hidden caverns are\r\ntreasures surpassing those of earth; and those who dwell on thee in\r\nships behold the wonders of the mighty deep.  We bow in adoration to thy\r\ngreat Creator; and we bow to thee in love and reverence and sympathy, O\r\nsea!\r\n\r\nEdith sat on the sea-shore.  The glassy waves were no longer encumbered\r\nwith ice, but shone like burnished gold in the light of the summer sun.\r\nHere and there, however, a large iceberg floated on the deep--a souvenir\r\nof winter past, a guarantee of winter yet to come.  At the base of these\r\nblue islands the sea, calm though it was, broke in a continual roar of\r\nsurf, and round their pinnacles the circling sea-birds sailed.  The\r\nyellow sands on which the child sat, the green willows that fringed the\r\nbackground of brown rocks, and the warm sun, contrasted powerfully with\r\nthe vestiges of winter on the sea, while a bright parhelia in the sky\r\nenriched and strengthened these characteristics of an arctic summer.\r\n\r\nThere was busy life and commotion in the Esquimau camp, from which Edith\r\nhad retired to some distance to indulge in solitude the sad reveries of\r\nhome, which weighed more heavily on her mind as the time flew by and the\r\nhope of speedy delivery began to fade.\r\n\r\n\"O my own dear mother,\" sighed the child aloud, while a tear trickled\r\ndown each cheek, \"shall I never see you more?  My heart is heavy with\r\nwishing, always wishing.  But no one comes.  I never see a boat or a\r\nship on that wide, wide sea.  Oh, when, when will it come?\"\r\n\r\nShe paused, and, as she had often done before, laid her face on her\r\nhands and wept.  But Edith soon recovered.  These bursts of grief never\r\nlasted long, for the child was strong in hope.  She never doubted that\r\ndeliverance would come at _last_; and she never failed to supplicate at\r\nthe throne of mercy, to which her mother had early taught her to fly in\r\nevery time of trouble and distress.\r\n\r\nSoon her attention was attracted from the sea, over whose wide expanse\r\nshe had been gazing wistfully, by the loud voices of the Esquimaux, as a\r\nnumber of them prepared to embark in their kayaks.  Several small whales\r\nhad been descried, and the natives, ever on the alert, were about to\r\nattack them.  Presently Edith observed Peetoot running along the beach\r\ntowards her with a seal-spear or harpoon in his hand.  This youth was a\r\nremarkably intelligent fellow, and had picked up a few words and\r\nsentences of English, of which he made the most.\r\n\r\n\"Eeduck!  Eeduck!\" he cried, pointing to one of the oomiaks which the\r\nwomen were launching, \"you go kill whale--funny; yes, Eeduck.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it will be very funny,\" said Edith, laughing; \"but I'll\r\ngo to please you, Peetoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goot, Eeduck; you is goot,\" shouted the boy, while he flourished his\r\nharpoon, and seizing his companion by the hand, dragged her in the\r\ndirection of the kayaks.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Edith was ensconced in the centre of the oomiak amid a\r\npack of noisy Esquimau women, whose tongues were loosed and spirits\r\nraised by the hope of a successful hunt.  They went merely for the\r\npurpose of witnessing the sport, which was to be prosecuted by twelve or\r\nthirteen men, each in his arrow-like kayak.  The women sat round their\r\nclumsy boat with their faces to the bow, each wielding a short, broad\r\npaddle, with which they propelled their craft at good speed over the\r\nglassy wave; but a few alternate dips of the long double-bladed paddles\r\nof the kayaks quickly sent the men far ahead of them.  In the stern of\r\nthe oomiak sat an old grey-headed man, who filled the office of\r\nsteersman; a duty which usually devolves upon old men after they become\r\nunfit to manage the kayak.  Indeed, it requires much vigour as well as\r\npractice to paddle the kayak, for it is so easily upset that a man could\r\nnot sit in it for a minute without the long paddle, in the clever use of\r\nwhich lies the security of the Esquimau.\r\n\r\nWhen the flotilla had paddled out a short distance a whale rose, and lay\r\nas if basking on the surface of the water.  Instantly the men in the\r\nkayaks shot towards it, while the oomiak followed as fast as possible.\r\nOn drawing near, the first Esquimau prepared his harpoon.  To the barb\r\nof this weapon a stout line, from eight to twelve fathoms long, was\r\nattached, having a _dan_, or float, made of a sealskin at the other end\r\nof it.  The dan was large enough to hold fifteen gallons or more.\r\n\r\nHaving paddled close to the whale, the Esquimau fixed the harpoon deep\r\nin its side, and threw the dan overboard.  The whale dived in an agony,\r\ncarrying the dan down along with it, and the Esquimau, picking up the\r\nliberated handle of the harpoon as he passed, paddled in the direction\r\nhe supposed the whale must have taken.  In a short time the dan\r\nre-appeared at no great distance.  The kayaks, as if shot from a bow,\r\ndarted towards the spot, and before the huge fish could dive a second\r\ntime, it received two more harpoons and several deep stabs from the\r\nlances of the Esquimaux.  Again it dived, carrying two additional dans\r\ndown with it.  But the dragging tendency of these three large floats,\r\ncombined with the deep wounds it had received, brought the fish sooner\r\nthan before to the surface, where it was instantly met and assailed by\r\nits relentless pursuers, who, in the course of little more than an hour,\r\nkilled it, and dragged it in triumph to the shore.\r\n\r\nThe natives were still occupied in towing the captured fish, when one of\r\nthe men uttered a wild shout, and pointed eagerly out to sea.  At first\r\nEdith imagined that they must have seen another whale in the distance;\r\nbut this opinion was quickly altered when she observed the eager haste\r\nwith which they paddled towards the land, and the looks of surprise with\r\nwhich, ever and anon, they regarded the object on the horizon.  This\r\nobject seemed a mere speck to Edith's unaccustomed eyes; but as she\r\ngazed long and earnestly at it, a thought flashed across her mind.  She\r\nsprang up; her sparkling eyes seemed as though they would burst from\r\ntheir sockets in her eager desire to make out this object of so great\r\ninterest.  At this moment the oomiak touched the land.  With a bound\r\nlike a gazelle Edith sprang on shore and ran panting with excitement to\r\nthe top of a rocky eminence.  Here she again directed her earnest gaze\r\nout to sea, while her colour went and came as she pressed her hands upon\r\nher breast in an agony of hope.  Slowly but surely the speck came on;\r\nthe wind shifted a point, which caused a gleam of sunlight to fall upon\r\na sail.  It was a boat! there could be no doubt of it--and making\r\ndirectly for the island!  Unable to contain herself, Edith, uttering a\r\npiercing cry, sank upon the ground and burst into a passionate flood of\r\ntears.  It was the irresistible impulse of hope long deferred at length\r\nrealised; for the child did not entertain a doubt that this was at\r\nlength the answer to her prayers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Esquimaux ran about in a state of extraordinary\r\nexcitement.  These people had very probably heard of the ships which\r\nonce a year pass through Hudson's Straits on their way to the depots on\r\nthe shores of Hudson's Bay; but they had never met with them, or seen a\r\nKublunat (white face) before that great day in their annals of discovery\r\nwhen they found little Edith fainting in the snow.  Their sharp eyes had\r\nat once detected that the approaching boat was utterly different from\r\ntheir own kayaks or oomiaks.  And truly it was; for as she drew near\r\nwith her white sails bending before the evening breeze that had recently\r\nsprung up, and the Union Jack flying from her peak, and the foam curling\r\nbefore her sharp prow, she seemed a very model of grace and symmetry.\r\n\r\nThere were only three figures in the boat, one of whom, by the violent\r\ngesticulations that he made as they approached, bespoke himself an\r\nEsquimau; the other two stood erect and motionless, the one by the\r\ntiller, the other by the sheet.\r\n\r\n\"Let go,\" said a deep soft voice, when the boat was within a\r\nstone's-cast of the shore.\r\n\r\nThe sheet flapped in the wind as the peak fell, and in another instant\r\nthe keel grated on the sand.\r\n\r\nFor one moment a feeling of intense disappointment filled Edith's heart\r\nas she sought in vain for the face of her father or Frank; then with a\r\ncry of joy she sprang forward and flung herself into the arms of her old\r\nenemy, Gaspard!\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" said Dick Prince, with a tremulous voice, as he leaped\r\nlightly from the boat and clasped the child in his arms; \"thank God we\r\nhave found you, Miss Edith!  This will put new life into your poor\r\nmother's heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! how is she?  Why did she not come with you?\" sobbed Edith; while\r\nDick Prince, seating himself on a rock, drew her on his knee and stroked\r\nher fair head as she wept upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Annatock was being nearly devoured by his wife and child and\r\ncountrymen, as they crowded round him to obtain information, and to heap\r\nupon him congratulations; and Gaspard, in order to restrain, and at the\r\nsame time relieve his feelings, essayed to drag the boat out of the\r\nwater, in which attempt, giant though he was, being single-handed, he\r\nutterly failed.\r\n\r\nAfter the first eager questions were answered on both sides, the natives\r\nwere informed by their comrade of the nature and objects of the\r\nestablishment at Ungava, and they exhibited the most extravagant signs\r\nof joy on hearing the news.  When their excitement was calmed down a\r\nlittle, they conducted the party to their principal tent, and set before\r\nthem the choicest viands they possessed, talking vehemently all the\r\nwhile, and indulging in a few antics occasionally, expressive of\r\nuncontrollable delight.\r\n\r\n\"Ye see, Miss Edith,\" began Prince, when he and Gaspard were seated\r\nbefore a round of walrus-beef, \"the way we came to know your whereabouts\r\nwas this: Gaspard and me was sent down to the coast to hunt seals, for\r\nwe were getting short o' blubber, and did not like to be obleeged to\r\ngive deer's-meat to the dogs.  Your father gave us the boat; `for,' says\r\nhe, `Prince, it'll take ye down faster than the canoe with this wind;\r\nand if ye see any o' the natives, be sure ye don't forget to ask about\r\n_her_, Prince.'  Ye see, Miss Edith, ever since ye was lost we never\r\nliked to mention your name, although we often spoke of you, for we felt\r\nthat we might be speakin' o' the dead.  Hows'ever, away we went for the\r\nshores o' the bay, and coasted along to the westward a bit.  Then we\r\nlanded at a place where there was a good lot o' field-ice floatin', with\r\nseals lyin' on it, and we began to catch them.  One day, when we was\r\ngoin' down to the ice as usual, we saw a black object sittin' on a floe\r\nthat had drifted in the night before with a stiff breeze.\r\n\r\n\"`That's a queer-lookin' seal,' says Gaspard.\r\n\r\n\"`So 'tis,' said I.  `If there was ever black bears up hereabouts, I\r\nwould say it was one o' them.'\r\n\r\n\"`Put a ball in yer gun,' says Gaspard; for ye see, as we had been\r\nblazin' at small birds the day before, there was nothing but shot in it.\r\nSo I put in a ball, and took aim at the beast, intendin' to give it a\r\nlong shot.  But I was mercifully prevented from firin'.  Jist as I\r\nsquinted along the barrel, the beast rose straight up, and held up both\r\nits fore paws.  `Stop!' roars Gaspard, in an awful fright; and sure\r\nenough I lowered my gun, and the beast hailed us in the voice of a man,\r\nand began to walk to the shore.  He seemed quite worn out when he\r\nlanded, and I could understand enough of his jargon to make out that he\r\nhad been blown out to sea on the floe, and that his name was Annatock.\r\n\r\n\"While we were talkin' to the Esquimau, Gaspard cries out, `I say,\r\nPrince, look here!  There's a sort o' medal on this chap's neck with\r\nsomethin' written on it.  You're a larned fellow, Prince; see if ye can\r\nmake it out.'  So I looked at it, and rubbed my eyes once or twice, I\r\ncan tell you, for, sure enough, there was EDITH as plain as the nose on\r\nmy face.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed Edith, smiling through her tears, \"that was the medal I\r\nhung round his neck long, long ago!  I hoped that it might be seen some\r\nday by people who knew me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so, miss,\" returned Prince--\"I thought as much, for I knew\r\nthat the Esquimau could never have invented and writ that out of his own\r\nhead, ye see.  But Gaspard and me had most awful trouble to get him to\r\nexplain how he came by it, and where he came from.  Howsoever, we made\r\nout at last that he came from an island in this direction; so we just\r\nmade up our minds to take the boat and come straight away for the\r\nisland, which we did, takin' Annatock to pilot us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then does my father not know where you are, or anything about your\r\nhaving heard of me?\" inquired Edith, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Why, no, Miss Edith,\" replied Prince.  \"You see, it would have lost us\r\ntwo or three days to have gone back to Fort Chimo; and, after all, we\r\nthought it might turn out a false scent, and only raise your poor\r\nmother's hopes for nothin'.  Besides, we were sent away for a week or\r\ntwo, so we knew they wouldn't wonder at our absence; so we thought, upon\r\nthe whole, it would be best to come at once, specially since it was sich\r\na short distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"A short distance!\" repeated Edith, starting up.  \"I thought we must be\r\nmiles and miles, oh, ever so far away!  Is the distance really short?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that it is, little one,\" said Prince, patting the child on the\r\nhead.  \"It is not more than three days' rowing from this island, and a\r\nstiff breeze on the quarter would carry us there in less than two.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Frank, where is Frank?\" said Edith,--with a look of eager inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, miss,\" replied Prince, \"he has been away almost as long as\r\nyourself.  Soon after you were lost a packet came from the south, and he\r\nwas obleeged to give up the sarch after you--though he was loath to do\r\nit--and set out with three o' the men for Moose.  From that day to this\r\nwe've heerd nothin' of him.  But the journey he had to make was a long\r\none--havin' to go round all the way to York Fort--so we didn't expect to\r\nhear o' him afore now.  But I'll tell ye more about all your old friends\r\nwhen we git--things ready for a start to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe remainder of that day was spent in making preparation for setting\r\nsail on the following morning.  The first intimation of the existence of\r\nthe new trading-fort had thrown the child-like natives into rapturous\r\ndelight; but when Prince told them he intended to go off the next day\r\nwith the child who had been as a bright spirit in their camp so long,\r\nthey fell into the depths of grief.  Indeed, there was manifested a\r\nslight desire to offer forcible opposition to this; but when Edith told\r\nthem, through the medium of Peetoot, who acted as her interpreter, that\r\nthe distance to her father's fort was not great, and that she would\r\nexpect them to come often there, and stay long, they became reconciled\r\nto her departure; and when she sought to turn their minds (a work of no\r\ngreat difficulty at any time) away from that subject by describing to\r\nthem the treasures of the trading-store, they danced and laughed and\r\nsang like very children.  Even Kaga's baby crowed with a racy richness\r\nof feeling, and smiled with an oily brilliancy of expression, compared\r\nwith which all its former exhibitions were mere child's play.\r\n\r\nBut when the hour of departure really came, and Edith bade farewell to\r\nher kind friends, whose rude but warm hospitality she had enjoyed so\r\nlong, they were again plunged into the deepest distress; and when the\r\nlittle boat finally put to sea, there was not a tearless eye among the\r\ntribe, while Edith was swiftly borne from their island shore before a\r\nstrong and favouring breeze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE CLOUDS ARE BROKEN, THE SUN BURSTS THROUGH AND ONCE MORE IRRADIATE\r\nPORT CHIMO--HOPES AND FEARS FOR MAXIMUS.\r\n\r\nThe wings of time moved slowly and heavily along at Fort Chimo.  Hope\r\nlong deferred, expectation frequently reviving and as often\r\ndisappointed, crushed the spirits of the little party.  The song, and\r\njest, and laugh seldom sounded from the houses of the men, who went\r\nthrough their daily avocations almost in silence.  Not only had the loss\r\nof Edith--the bright spirit of the place, the tender rosebud in that\r\nsavage wilderness--cast an overwhelming gloom upon the fort, but the\r\nfailure of the trade, to a great extent, had added to the general\r\ndepression, and now fresh anxiety was beginning to be felt at the\r\nnon-appearance of Frank Morton.\r\n\r\n\"Jessie,\" said Stanley one day, as he rose from the desk at which he had\r\nbeen writing, and put on his cap with the intention of taking a stroll\r\nalong the beach, \"will you come with me today?  I know not how it is,\r\nbut every time I go out now I expect to hear the ship's gun as it comes\r\nthrough the narrows.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Stanley rose, and throwing on a shawl and hood, accompanied her\r\nhusband in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" she said at length, \"you expect to hear the gun because the\r\nvessel _ought_ to be here by this time.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, La Roche came up and touched his cap.  \"Please, madame,\r\nvat you vill have pour dinner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you please, La Roche.  Repeat yesterday's,\" answered Mrs\r\nStanley, with the air of one who did not wish to be troubled further on\r\nthe subject.  But La Roche was not to be so easily put down.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, madame! pardonnez moi.  Dat is impossible.  Ve have fresh fish\r\nyesterday, dere be no fresh fish to-day.  More de pity.  C'est dommage--\r\ndat Gaspard him gone away--\"\r\n\r\nLa Roche was interrupted by a sudden exclamation from his master, who\r\npointed, while he gazed earnestly, towards the narrows of the river.  It\r\nseemed as if the scene of last year were repeated in a vision.  Against\r\nthe dark rock appeared the white, triangular sail of a vessel.  Slowly,\r\nlike a phantom, it came into view, for the wind was very light; while\r\nthe three spectators on the beach gazed with beating hearts, scarcely\r\ndaring to credit their eyes.  In a few seconds another sail appeared--a\r\nschooner floated into view; a white cloud burst from her bows, and once\r\nagain the long, silent echoes of Ungava were awakened by the roaring of\r\nartillery.  The men of the fort left their several employments and\r\nrushed to the beach to welcome the vessel with a cheer; but although it\r\nwas heartfelt and vigorous, it was neither so prolonged nor so\r\nenthusiastic as it was on the first occasion of the ship's arrival.\r\n\r\nAs the vessel dropped anchor opposite the fort, Frank Morton leaped on\r\nher bow, and along with the crew returned the cheer with a degree of\r\nenergy that awakened memories of other days.\r\n\r\n\"There's Frank!\" cried Stanley, turning on his wife a glance of joy.\r\n\"Bless the boy!  It warms my heart to see him.  He must have picked up\r\nsome Indian woman by the way.  I see the flutter of a petticoat.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the boat pushed off from the vessel's side, and a few rapid\r\nstrokes sent it bounding towards the shore.\r\n\r\n\"Eh! what's this?\" exclaimed Stanley, as his wife broke from him, and\r\nwith a wild shriek rushed into the lake.\r\n\r\nThe figure of a child stood on the boat's bow, with her arms extended to\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah, lads! give way!\" shouted Frank's deep voice.\r\n\r\n\"Mother! mother!\" cried the child.\r\n\r\nIn another moment Frank bounded over the boat's side and placed Edith in\r\nher mother's arms!\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nReader, there are incidents in the histories of men which cannot be\r\nminutely described without being marred.  Such an one was the meeting\r\nbetween the father and mother and their long-lost child.  We refrain\r\nfrom attempting to draw aside the curtain further than to say that the\r\njoy and gratitude in more than one heart at Ungava found vent that night\r\nin thanksgiving to Him who can bring light out of darkness and turn\r\nsorrow into joy.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the day was spent at the fort in that feverish\r\nexcitement which cannot calm down to steady conversation, but vents\r\nitself in eager, rambling questions and abrupt replies.  Meanwhile, the\r\nnecessity of discharging the cargo of the vessel, and preparing the furs\r\nfor shipment, served to distract the attention and occupy the hands of\r\nthe whole party.\r\n\r\nAs evening advanced, La Roche, true to his duty, placed supper on the\r\ntable, and Stanley and his wife, along with Edith and Frank, while they\r\npartook of the meal, continued their inquiries.\r\n\r\n\"Whereabouts was it, Frank, that you fell in with the boat?\" said\r\nStanley.\r\n\r\n\"Not more than five miles from the mouth of the river, at about six this\r\nmorning.  We observed the boat beset by a pretty solid pack of ice, and\r\nyou may be sure we were not a little surprised when we saw the Union\r\nJack run up to her peak; so I ordered our boat to be lowered, intending\r\nto go to her assistance.  While the men were doing this, I examined her\r\nwith the glass, and then it was that I found, to my amazement and\r\ninexpressible joy, that the boat contained Prince, Gaspard, and Edith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  Frank,\" said Mrs Stanley, \"was it not a strange providence that\r\nyou, who were so sad at being compelled to give up the search, should be\r\nthe one appointed to find our beloved child, and bring her back to us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" replied Frank, \"it was not I who found her.  Let me not rob Dick\r\nPrince and Gaspard of the honour and gratitude which they have nobly\r\nwon.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you think of the non-arrival of Maximus?\" said Stanley,\r\nwhose feelings were still too much perturbed to allow him to dwell for\r\nmore than a few minutes at a time on any subject.  Frank shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I know not what to think,\" said he.  \"As I have told you already, we\r\nleft him at Moose Fort with his recovered bride, and we got the\r\nmissionary to marry them there in due form.  Next day they started in a\r\nsmall canoe on their return voyage to Ungava, and the day following I\r\nleft for Lake Superior.  I fully expected to find them here on my\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\nStanley looked grave.  \"I fear much,\" said he, \"that some mischance has\r\nbefallen the good-hearted Esquimau.  He was well armed, you say, and\r\namply supplied with provisions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, most certainly.  He took two guns with him, saying that his wife\r\nwas as good a shot as himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"The men wish to know where the heavy goods are to be put,\" said Massan,\r\nas he opened the door, and stood, cap in hand, awaiting orders.\r\n\r\nStanley rose to leave the room.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be with you in a minute, Massan.--Then, Frank, we'll expect an\r\naccount of your journey to-night.  Eda is very anxious that we should be\r\ntold all about your wonderful adventures in the mountains.  Meanwhile I\r\nshall be off to look after the men.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the sun had set that night, and the song of the sailors had ceased,\r\nand most of the wearied inhabitants of Fort Chimo were enjoying a\r\nfragrant pipe after the labours of the day, Frank and Stanley seated\r\nthemselves, one on either side of the fire-place, with Mrs Stanley and\r\nEdith in front of the hearth between them.  An extra pine-knot was\r\nthrown on the fire, which, in a few minutes, rendered the candle on the\r\ntable unnecessary.  Stanley lit his pipe, and after drawing one or two\r\nwhiffs to make sure that it would keep alight, said,--\"Now, Frank, my\r\nboy, we're ready for you; fire away.\"\r\n\r\nFrank fired away, literally, for he applied a piece of glowing charcoal\r\nto his pipe, and fired off half a dozen rapid puffs in reply, as it\r\nwere, to his friend opposite.  Then he began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nROUGH AND TUMBLE--A POLAR BEAR MADE USEFUL--FISHING AND FLOUNDERING, AND\r\nNARROW ESCAPES--AN UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY, PRODUCTIVE OF MINGLED\r\nPERPLEXITY AND JOY.\r\n\r\n\"You remember, I daresay, that the day on which I left Ungava, last\r\nspring, was an unusually fine one--just such a day, Eda, as those on\r\nwhich you and I and Chimo were wont to clamber up the berry-glen.  But\r\nthe clambering that we went through there was nothing to the work we\r\nwent through on our third day from the fort.  Maximus and Oolibuck were\r\nfirst-rate climbers, and we would have got over the ground much faster\r\nthan we did but for the dogs, which could not travel easily over the\r\nrough ground with their loaded sled.  Chimo, indeed, hauled like a hero,\r\nand if the other dogs had been equal to him we would have been here\r\nbefore to-day.  Well, as I said, our third day was one of considerable\r\ntoil.  Leaving the river we struck into the mountains, but after nearly\r\nbreaking our sled to pieces, and endangering our necks more than once,\r\nwe found it necessary to return to the river and follow its windings\r\ninto the interior.\r\n\r\n\"After many days of as rough travelling as I ever experienced, we came\r\nto the lake district on the height of land, and travelled for some time\r\nmore rapidly and with much greater ease.  There were plenty of ptarmigan\r\nhere, so that we saved our provisions--a matter of importance, as you\r\nknow, in a country where we might have found nothing fit for food.  One\r\nevening, towards sunset, as we were crossing a large lake, it came on to\r\nsnow heavily, and ere long we could not see the land.\r\n\r\n\"`What shall we do, Maximus?' said I; `it seems to me that if we go on\r\nwe may wander out of our course and lose much time ere we find it again.\r\nShall we turn back?'\r\n\r\n\"`Better go on,' replied Maximus.\r\n\r\n\"Oolibuck seemed to be of the same opinion, so I gave my whip a flourish\r\nto urge on the dogs, which were beginning to flag, owing to the\r\ndifficulty of drawing the sled through the deepening snow.  But the two\r\nrear dogs could hardly be prevailed on to move.  Even Chimo was knocked\r\nup.  In this dilemma Maximus came to my aid.  He hung one of the\r\nptarmigan at his belt, and letting the dogs smell it, walked on before.\r\nThe hungry animals brightened up instantly, and went forward for a\r\nconsiderable distance with alacrity.\r\n\r\n\"But after trudging on for two or three miles, the snow fell so thickly\r\nthat we thought proper to call a halt and hold another council of war.\r\n\r\n\"`Now,' said I, `it is my opinion that we should encamp on the ice;\r\nthere is no use in wearying the dogs, and ourselves in uncertainty; what\r\nthink you, lads?'\r\n\r\n\"`Me t'ink so too,' said Oolibuck.\r\n\r\n\"Maximus nodded his head by way of assent, so we immediately set to work\r\nto make our encampment.  You recollect the hut we built on the lake when\r\nI was so badly hurt, and when you were lost, Eda?  Well, we made a\r\nsnow-house just like that one; and as we worked very hard, we had it up\r\nand were all snug under its shelter in little more than two hours.\r\nMeanwhile, the dogs were fed; and a small piece of wood, that we\r\nfortunately brought with us on the sled, was cut up, and a fire kindled.\r\nBut this only served long enough to boil the kettle; and then it went\r\nout, leaving us to eat our supper in the dark, for by this time the sun\r\nhad set.  However, we did not mind that much; and when we had finished,\r\nand were stretched out side by side on the snow, smoking our pipes,\r\nwhile the dogs lay at our feet and kept us warm, I thought that a palace\r\ncould not have been more comfortable than our snow-house.\r\n\r\n\"As we had no wood wherewith to make another fire, and so could not\r\nprocure water except by the tedious process of digging through the ice,\r\nI resolved to try an experiment which I had once heard had been\r\nattempted with success.  This was, to fill a bottle with snow and take\r\nit to bed with me.  During the night the heat of my body melted the\r\nsnow, and in the morning we had sufficient water to give us each a\r\ndraught at breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"When morning came we found that it was blowing and drifting so hard\r\nthat we could not venture to move; so we made up our minds to remain\r\nwhere we were until the weather should moderate.\r\n\r\n\"`Maximus,' said I, after our breakfast of cold boiled ptarmigan was\r\nover, `set to work outside and dig a hole through the ice.  I have no\r\ndoubt we shall find fish in this lake.  If we do, they will form an\r\nexcellent addition to our fare.  I will prepare the lines and hooks.'\r\n\r\n\"Maximus, whose huge body was stretched out at full length, while he\r\nenjoyed his pipe, rose to obey; but as he was about to leave the hut\r\nOolibuck said a few words to him.\r\n\r\n\"`Please, sir,' said Oolibuck, with his usual oily smile, `my countrymen\r\nfish in igloo when blow hard.  Pr'aps ve make hole here, if you like.'\r\n\r\n\"`Very good,' said I; `make the hole where you please, and look sharp\r\nabout it, else I shall have my lines prepared before you reach the\r\nwater.'\r\n\r\n\"The two Esquimaux immediately set to work, and in less than an hour a\r\nhole about six feet deep was yawning in the middle of our floor.\r\nThrough this we set two lines, and our usual luck attended us\r\nimmediately.  We caught five or six excellent white-fish, and one or two\r\ntrout, in the first half-hour, so that we were enabled to give the dogs\r\na capital feed.  Moreover, we froze as many as we could carry along with\r\nus for future use; but we had not the satisfaction of having a good\r\ndinner of them that day, as we had no wood wherewith to make fire.  You\r\nwould have been greatly amused had you peeped in at the ice-window of\r\nour igloo that day, as we sat round the hole in the floor with eager,\r\nexcited looks.  I confess, however, that I left the work principally to\r\nthe two men, who seemed to relish it amazingly.  Maximus was earnest and\r\nenergetic, as he always is; but the expression of Oolibuck's face\r\nunderwent the most extraordinary transformations--now beaming with\r\nintense hope, as he felt, or thought he felt, a _tug_; anon blazing with\r\nexcitement, while his body jerked as if a galvanic shock had assailed\r\nit, under the influence of a decided _pull_.  Then his visage was\r\nelongated as the fish escaped, and was again convulsed by another pull,\r\nor shone in triumph as he hauled the wriggling captive into the light of\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"Towards evening the wind fell, and we resumed our journey.  We were not\r\nagain interrupted by weather for more than a week after this, but were\r\nmuch perplexed by the chains of small lakes into which we came.  At last\r\nwe reached Clearwater Lake, and had a long consultation as to the best\r\ncourse to pursue, because it was now a question whether we should follow\r\nthe chain of lakes by which we came up to Ungava in our canoes, or make\r\na straight cut for the coast and take our chance of finding it.  While\r\nwe were yet uncertain what to do, our course was decided by a polar\r\nbear!\"\r\n\r\n\"A polar bear!\" cried Edith, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Ay; a polar bear and her cub settled the question for us, as you shall\r\nhear presently,\" replied Frank.  \"But first hand me papa's\r\ntobacco-pouch, please, as my pipe is exhausted.\r\n\r\n\"There, now,\" continued Frank, re-lighting his pipe, and throwing a\r\nfresh log on the fire, \"that's comfortable.  Well, as I said, we were\r\nsomewhat perplexed as to what we should do, when, in wandering about the\r\nlake endeavouring to find the outlet, I came upon the track of a polar\r\nbear; and by the side of it were little foot-prints, which showed me\r\nthat it was a she-bear with her cub.  I observed that the tracks were\r\nquite fresh.\r\n\r\n\"`Now, then, Maximus,' said I, pointing to the tracks, which went to the\r\nwestward, `there is a sure guide who will conduct us by the quickest\r\nroute to the coast.'  I could tell this, Eda, because I knew that the\r\nbear had found food rather scarce in those high regions, and would\r\ndescend Clearwater River in order to fish in the open water at the\r\nfalls, which are very numerous in that river.  On reaching the coast it\r\nwould find plenty seals in the sea.  In the meantime I had nothing to do\r\nbut follow its track to be conducted by the shortest route to Clearwater\r\nRiver, the commencement of which was difficult to find owing to the\r\nflatness of the margin of the lake at this end.  Away we went then, and,\r\nas I had expected, were soon led to the river, down the banks of which\r\nwe scrambled, over rocks and crags, through bushes and snow, until we\r\ncame to the coast at Richmond Gulf.\r\n\r\n\"But it took us many weeks to accomplish the journey which I have\r\nbriefly sketched thus far, and when we reached the coast, worn with hard\r\ntravel, and our clothing uncomfortably ragged, the spring was well\r\nadvanced--rivers were breaking up, ducks and geese were passing to the\r\nnorth, and there were thousands of deer, so that we found ourselves\r\nsuddenly in the midst of abundance.  Just before reaching the gulf I\r\nwitnessed the breaking up of a river, which was one of the grandest\r\nsights I ever saw.\r\n\r\n\"The river was not a very large one.  On reaching it we were much struck\r\nwith a curious barrier of ice that was jammed across it.  On examination\r\nI saw that the ice had given way some time before we arrived there, and\r\nan enormous cake, of many yards surface and fully six feet thick, had,\r\nwhile being hurled along by the swelling water, caught upon the rugged\r\nrocks and been tilted upon end.  Thus it formed a temporary barrier,\r\nagainst which other masses were forced until the outlet was completely\r\nchecked, and the water began to rise with great rapidity.  As we stood\r\non the high cliff, looking down on the wild ravine in which this was\r\ngoing on, I heard a loud crack.  In another instant the obstructing\r\nbarrier burst like a thunderclap, and the pent-up waters leaped with one\r\nmighty roar into their accustomed channel!  The devastation created was\r\ninconceivably grand.  Rocks of many tons weight were torn up, cast like\r\nplaythings on the rushing ice, and hurled on the cliffs below, while\r\ntrees, and ice, and water swept down the gorge in a mad whirl, that made\r\nmy brain reel as I gazed at it.  In an hour the worst of this awful\r\nscene was over, but the unutterable desolation that was left will remain\r\nfor centuries, I believe, to tell of the mighty _rush_ that happened\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\"Our first experience of Richmond Gulf was not by any means pleasant.\r\nWhen we arrived it was covered with ice; but we did not know that,\r\nalthough it appeared to be solid enough, it was in reality little better\r\nthan frozen sludge or foam.  Oolibuck happened to be walking first, with\r\nthe line of his little sled over his shoulder.  For a short distance we\r\nplodded on, intending to cross the gulf; but I was suddenly aroused from\r\na reverie by a shout from Maximus.  Looking hastily up, I beheld nothing\r\nof Oolibuck except his head above the ice, while Maximus was trying to\r\npull him out by hauling at the tail-line of the sled.  Luckily Oolibuck\r\nhad kept fast hold of the line which was over his shoulder, and after\r\nmuch trouble we succeeded in dragging him out of the water.  A sharp\r\nfrost happened to have set in, and before we got back to the shore the\r\npoor fellow's garments were frozen so stiff that he could not run.\r\n\r\n\"`This is a bad job, Maximus,' said I; `we must carry him.  Do you lift\r\nhis head, and I'll take the feet.'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh be queek!  I is frizzen up,' cried Oolibuck, casting a rueful look\r\nthrough his tangled locks, which were a mere mass of icicles!\r\n\r\n\"Maximus gave a loud chuckle, and before I could assist him he seized\r\nhis comrade in his powerful arms, heaved him over his shoulder like a\r\nsack, and ran towards the shore as lightly as if his burden were a child\r\ninstead of a big over-fed Esquimau!\r\n\r\n\"Arrived at the woods, we wrapped Oolibuck in our blankets; then we\r\nkindled a fire, and in two hours after his clothes were dried and\r\nhimself ready to proceed.  This might have turned out a more serious\r\naccident, however, and we felt very thankful when we had our damp\r\ncompanion steaming beside a good fire.  The lesson was not thrown away,\r\nfor we coasted round Richmond Gulf instead of attempting to cross it.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" continued Frank, stirring the fire and re-lighting his pipe,\r\nwhich invariably went out at the interesting parts of his\r\nnarrative--\"now I come to that part of my story which bears on the fate\r\nof Maximus.\r\n\r\n\"As I have said, we had arrived at the coast, and began to look forward\r\nto Moose Fort as the first resting-place on our journey.  By far the\r\ngreater part of the journey lay before us, Eda; for, according to my\r\ncalculation, I have travelled since last spring a distance of three\r\nthousand miles, nearly a thousand of which have been performed on foot,\r\nupwards of a thousand in boats and canoes, and a thousand by sea; and in\r\nthe whole distance I did not see a civilised spot of ground or a single\r\nroad--not so much as a bridle-path.  As Bryan's favourite song has it--\r\n\r\n\"`Over mountains and rivers I was pelted to shivers.'\r\n\r\n\"But I'm happy to say I have not, as the same song continues, `met on\r\nthis land with a wathery grave.'  I was very near it once, however, as\r\nyou shall hear.\r\n\r\n\"Well, away we went along the coast of James's Bay, much relieved to\r\nthink that the mountains were now past, and that our road henceforth,\r\nwhatever else it might be, was level.  One evening, as we were plodding\r\nwearily along, after a hard day's march over soft snow alternated with\r\nsandy beach--for the spring was fast advancing--we came suddenly on a\r\ncamp of Indians.  At first I thought they must be some of the Moose\r\nIndians, but on inquiry I found that they were a party of Muskigons, who\r\nhad wandered all over East Main, and seemed to be of a roving, unsettled\r\ndisposition.  However, we determined to encamp along with them for that\r\nnight, and get all the information we could out of them in regard to\r\ntheir hunting-grounds.\r\n\r\n\"We spent a great part of the night in the leathern wigwam of the\r\nprincipal chief, who was a sinister-looking old rascal, though I must\r\nsay he received us hospitably enough, and entertained us with a good\r\ndeal of small-talk, after time and the pipe had worn away his reserve.\r\nBut I determined to spend part of the night in the tent of a solitary\r\nold woman who had recently been at Moose Fort, and from whom I hoped to\r\nhear some news of our friends there.  You know I have had always a\r\npartiality for miserable old wives, Eda; which accounts, perhaps, for my\r\nliking for you!  This dame had been named Old Moggy by the people at\r\nMoose; and she was the most shrivelled, dried-up, wrinkled old body you\r\never saw.  She was testy too; but this was owing to the neglect she\r\nexperienced at the hands of her tribe.  She was good-tempered by nature,\r\nhowever; a fact which became apparent the longer I conversed with her.\r\n\r\n\"`Well, Old Moggy,' said I, on entering her tent, `what cheer, what\r\ncheer?'\r\n\r\n\"`There's no cheer here,' she replied peevishly, in the Indian tongue.\r\n\r\n\"`Nay, then,' said I, `don't be angry, mother; here's a bit o' baccy to\r\nwarm your old heart.  But who is this you have got beside you?'  I\r\nasked, on observing a good-looking young girl, with a melancholy cast of\r\ncountenance, seated in a dark corner of the wigwam, as if she sought\r\nconcealment.  I observed that she was whiter than Indians usually are,\r\nand supposed at first that she was a half-breed girl; but a second\r\nglance convinced me that she had little if any of the Indian blood in\r\nher veins.\r\n\r\n\"`She is my only friend,' said Old Moggy, her dark eye brightening as\r\nshe glanced towards the girl.  `She was to have been my son's wife, but\r\nthe Great Spirit took my son away.  She is all that is left to me now.'\r\n\r\n\"The old woman's voice trembled as she spoke the last few words, and she\r\nspread her skinny hands over the small fire that smouldered in the\r\ncentre of the floor.\r\n\r\n\"I was proceeding to make further inquiries into this girl's history,\r\nwhen the curtain-door of the tent was raised and Oolibuck thrust in his\r\nshaggy head.\r\n\r\n\"`Please, sir, de ole chief him wants baccy.  I have smoke all mine.\r\nVill you give some?'\r\n\r\n\"`Here you are,' said I, throwing a lump to the Esquimau.  `Send Maximus\r\nto me; I want to speak with him.'\r\n\r\n\"`I is here,' said Maximus, outside the tent.\r\n\r\n\"`Ah! that's right.--Now, Old Moggy, I'll be back in a few minutes, so\r\ndon't go to sleep till I return.'\r\n\r\n\"As I was about to issue from the tent, the young girl passed me\r\nhastily, and, drawing the hood over her head and face, darted through\r\nthe opening.  I found Maximus gazing after her in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"`Hallo, Maximus! what's wrong?  Do you think the girl's a witch?'\r\n\r\n\"`No; but I t'ink she be funny.  She look close into my face, and fly\r\n'way when you come hout o' tent.'\r\n\r\n\"`That's odd.  Did you ever see her before?'\r\n\r\n\"`I not see her yet.  She keep face covered up.'\r\n\r\n\"`Well, come along, it doesn't signify.  I want you to go with me to the\r\nchief's wigwam, to ask where we are to put the dogs for the night, and\r\nto see about our own quarters.'\r\n\r\n\"Old Moggy's wigwam stood at the distance of several hundred yards from\r\nthe other tents of the village, from which it was separated by a belt of\r\nstunted trees and willows.  Through this copsewood Maximus and I took\r\nour way, following one of the many beaten tracks made by the Indians.\r\nThe night was clear, and we found no difficulty in picking our steps\r\namong the low shrubs.  When we were about half-way through this wood, I\r\nobserved a female form gliding among the bushes.  She ran towards\r\nMaximus, who walked in advance and concealed me with his bulky form.\r\nBut a slight bend in the road revealed my figure, and the woman paused,\r\nas if uncertain what to do.\r\n\r\n\"`Surely that is your unknown friend again,' said I, as we both halted.\r\nThen I beckoned her to approach.  At first she appeared unwilling to do\r\nso; but suddenly she seemed to change her mind, and walking boldly up to\r\nMaximus, she threw back her hood and stood before him.  I observed that\r\nshe was Moggy's young friend, but a wondrous change had come over her.\r\nThe pale cheeks were now covered with a bright blush, and the sad eyes\r\nwere sparkling with animation, as she gazed intently into the face of\r\nthe Esquimau.  For a few seconds Maximus looked like one thunder-struck.\r\n`Aneetka!' he exclaimed vehemently, and, striding forward with a\r\nsuppressed cry, clasped the girl in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"You may easily conceive my surprise at this scene.  Immediately the\r\nrecollection of the attack by the Indians on the Esquimau camp, and of\r\nMaximus's young bride having been carried off, flashed upon me, and I\r\nhad no doubt that the Esquimau girl now stood before me.  Indeed, the\r\nfact of the broken exclamations uttered by the pair being in the\r\nEsquimau tongue put this beyond a doubt.  A feeling of great delight\r\nfilled my heart as I looked upon the couple thus unexpectedly reunited;\r\nwhile they, quite oblivious of my presence, poured out a flood of\r\nquestion and reply, in the midst of which they ever and anon embraced,\r\nto make sure, no doubt, of their physical identity.  Then it suddenly\r\noccurred to me that I was behaving very ill, so I wheeled about and\r\nsauntered away to a little distance in the direction of the shore, in\r\norder to take some astronomical observations of the sky, and gaze\r\ninquiringly up at the moon, which at that moment broke through a bank of\r\nclouds, tipping the icebergs on the sea and the branches of the\r\noverhanging trees with silver light.\r\n\r\n\"In quarter of an hour Maximus came to me and presented his long-lost\r\nbride, Aneetka, whose pretty face beamed with joy, while her lover's\r\nframe appeared to expand with felicity until he looked like an\r\nexaggerated Hercules.  But we had no time to waste in talking of the\r\npast.  The present required our instant and earnest attention; so we sat\r\ndown on the stem of a fallen tree to consult as to how we were to get\r\nAneetka out of the hands of her Indian captors.  Her brief history,\r\nafter she was captured at Ungava, was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"The Indian who had intended to make her his bride found her resolved\r\nrather to die than to marry him; but hoping that time would overcome her\r\nobjection, he placed her under the care of his widowed mother, Old\r\nMoggy, on returning to his village in the interior.  Soon afterwards\r\nthis Indian was killed by a brown bear, and the poor mother became a\r\nsort of outcast from the tribe, having no relations to look after her.\r\nShe was occasionally assisted, however, by two youths, who came to sue\r\nfor the hand of the Esquimau girl.  But Aneetka, true to her first love,\r\nwould not listen to their proposals.  One of these lovers was absent on\r\na hunting expedition at the time we discovered Aneetka; the other, a\r\nsurly fellow, and disliked by the most of his comrades, was in the camp.\r\nFrom the day of her son's death, a feeling of sympathy had sprung up\r\nbetween Old Moggy and the Esquimau girl, and this had gradually\r\nstrengthened into affection.\r\n\r\n\"Thus matters stood when we fell in with her.  After much deliberation,\r\nit was resolved that I should go to the old chief and tell him that Old\r\nMoggy and her adopted child wished to quit the tribe and go to Moose\r\nwith us, to live there; while Aneetka should go and acquaint her old\r\nprotectress with our plans and her own altered circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"`Adieu, then, Aneetka,' said I, as the girl pushed her lover away and\r\nbounded into the woods.--`Now, Maximus, nothing will do for it but stout\r\nhearts and strong arms.  Come along, lad.'\r\n\r\n\"I found, to my surprise, that the old chief had no objection to the\r\narrangement I proposed.  A few of the others did not seem inclined to\r\npart with their captive; but I explained to them the advantage it would\r\nbe to them to have friends at court, as it were, and said that the\r\nfur-traders would be glad to support Moggy in her old age--which was\r\ntrue enough, for you all know as well as I do that there is not a post\r\nin the country where there are not one or more old or otherwise helpless\r\nIndians supported gratuitously by the Hudson's Bay Company.  The only\r\nman who resolutely opposed the proposal was Meestagoosh, the rejected\r\nlover; but I silenced him in a novel manner.  He was a tall, powerful\r\nfellow, of about my own size.\r\n\r\n\"`Come,' said I to his assembled comrades, in the Indian language, for I\r\nfound they understood my bad mixture of Cree and Sauteaux very\r\nwell--`come, friends, let us deal fairly in this matter.  My man there\r\nhas taken a fancy to the girl--let Meestagoosh and Maximus wrestle for\r\nher.'\r\n\r\n\"A loud laugh greeted this proposal, as the Indians surveyed the huge\r\nproportions of my Esquimau.\r\n\r\n\"`Well, then,' I continued, `if Meestagoosh is afraid of the Esquimau, I\r\nhave no objections to try him myself.'  The Indian looked at me with an\r\nangry glance, and seemed, I thought, half inclined to accept the\r\nchallenge; so, to cut the matter short, I took him by the throat and\r\nhurled him to the ground--a feat which was evidently enjoyed by his\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\n\"Meestagoosh rose and retired with a savage scowl on his face, and I saw\r\nno more of him.  Indeed, I believe he left the camp immediately.\r\n\r\n\"After this no opposition was offered, and I made the matter sure by\r\ndistributing a large quantity of powder, shot, and tobacco to the\r\nchiefs.  Old Moggy made no objection to our plan, so we set out the next\r\nday with an additional dog purchased from the Indians in order to make\r\nour team strong enough to haul the old woman when she got knocked up\r\nwith walking.  Six days brought us to Moose Fort, just as the ice on the\r\nriver was breaking up.  Here, as I have already told you, Maximus and\r\nAneetka were married in due form by the Wesleyan missionary, after they\r\nhad received some instruction and expressed their desire to become\r\nChristians.  Then they were supplied with a canoe and all necessary\r\nprovisions, and sent off to go round the coast to Ungava, accompanied by\r\nour good dog Chimo, for whom we had now no further use, and by Old\r\nMoggy, who would not consent to be separated from her friend Aneetka.\r\nThey started along the coast on a fine spring day, and the back of his\r\nsealskin coat, shining in the sun's rays like velvet, as the canoe swept\r\nout to sea, and disappeared behind a low point, was the last that I saw\r\nof Maximus.\r\n\r\n\"I will not weary you just now,\" continued Frank, \"with the details of\r\nmy subsequent journeying, as, although full of incidents, nothing of a\r\nvery thrilling character occurred except once.  At Moose I remained till\r\nthe rivers were clear of ice, and then set off into the interior of the\r\ncountry with a small canoe and five men, Oolibuck being bowsman.  For\r\nmany days we voyaged by rivers and lakes, until we arrived at the\r\nMichipicoten River, which is a very rough one, and full of tremendous\r\nfalls and rapids.  One day, while we were descending a rapid that rushed\r\nthrough a dark gorge of frowning rocks, and terminated in a fall, our\r\ncanoe was broken in two, and the most of us thrown into the water.  We\r\nall swam ashore in safety, with the exception of one man, who clung to\r\nthe canoe, poor fellow, and was carried along with it over the fall.  We\r\nnever saw him more, although we searched long and carefully for his\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\"We now found ourselves in a very forlorn condition.  We were dripping\r\nwet, without the means of making a fire, and without provisions or\r\nblankets, in the midst of a wild, uninhabited country.  However, we did\r\nnot lose heart, but set off on foot to follow the river to its mouth,\r\nwhere we knew we should find relief at Michipicoten Fort.  The few days\r\nthat followed were the most miserable I ever passed.  We allayed the\r\ncravings of hunger by scraping off the inner bark of the trees, and by a\r\nfew of last year's berries which had been frozen and so preserved.  Once\r\nor twice we crossed the river on rafts of drift-wood, and at night lay\r\ndown close to each other under the shelter of a tree or cliff.  At\r\nlength we arrived at the fort on Lake Superior, quite worn out with\r\nfatigue and starvation.  Here we waited until the canoes from Canada\r\npassed; and after a somewhat similar voyage, through woods, rivers, and\r\nlakes, arrived at length, about the beginning of autumn, at York Fort,\r\non Hudson's Bay.\r\n\r\n\"Here I spent some weeks in recalling to memory and recording on paper\r\nthe contents of my dispatches, which had been lost, along with our canoe\r\nand baggage, in Michipicoten River; and when these were finished and\r\ndelivered, I embarked, along with our outfit of goods, in the _Beaver_,\r\nand sailed for Ungava.  I need scarcely add that the voyage was a\r\nprosperous one, and that the brightest day in it all was that on which\r\nwe found the boat, with our dear little Edith, beset among the ice near\r\nthe entrance to Ungava Bay.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Frank was thus occupied in narrating the events of his long\r\njourney in the hall of Fort Chimo, Oolibuck was similarly employed in\r\nentertaining the men.  After the day's toil of unloading the ship was\r\nover, he was placed in the middle of the circle, directly in front of\r\nthe blazing fire, by Dick Prince and Massan; while Moses, Oostesimow,\r\nGaspard, and Ma-istequan sat on his right; and Bryan, La Roche,\r\nFrancois, and Augustus supported him on the left--all having pipes in\r\ntheir mouths, which were more or less blackened by constant use.  A pipe\r\nwas then handed to Oolibuck, and the order given, generally by Bryan,\r\n\"to blaze away.\"\r\n\r\nThis the oily-visaged Esquimau did with right good-will; and the shouts\r\nof laughter which issued from the house occasionally, as he proceeded\r\nwith his interminable narration, proved that the spirit and humour of\r\nthe stout voyageur had not been crushed by the trials and dangers of his\r\nlong, eventful journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nA STIRRING PERIOD IN THE LIFE OF MAXIMUS.\r\n\r\nIntermingled joy and sorrow is the lot of man.  Thus it has ever been;\r\nthus, no doubt, it shall continue to be until the present economy shall\r\nhave reached its termination.  \"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do\r\nright?\" is a sufficient reply to those who would fain have it otherwise.\r\nBut, independently of this view of the subject, may we not, with the\r\npainter's eye, regard joy as the light, sorrow as the shade, in the\r\npicture of life?  And who would have a painting _all_ light or _all_\r\nshadow?\r\n\r\nMaximus found it so in his experience.  The shadows in the picture of\r\nhis life had of late been broad and dark, but a flash of vivid\r\nbrilliancy had crossed it when he found his bride.  Afterwards the light\r\nand shade were chequered, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Moose, Maximus proceeded a day's journey along the coast, and\r\nat night, as the weather was fine, he encamped with his wife and Old\r\nMoggy and Chimo on the open seashore.  Here he held a consultation as to\r\ntheir future proceedings.  As long as they were on the shore of James's\r\nBay they were in danger of being found by Indians; but once beyond\r\nRichmond Gulf they would be comparatively safe, and in the land of the\r\nEsquimaux.  After mature deliberation it was resolved that they should\r\ntravel during the night, and rest and cook their food during the\r\ndaytime, when a fire would not be so likely to attract attention if\r\nkindled in sequestered places.\r\n\r\nThis plan answered very well, and they passed stealthily along the coast\r\nwhen the Indians, if there were any there, were buried in repose.  On\r\napproaching the camp of the tribe, however, from whom Aneetka had been\r\ntaken, Maximus deemed it advisable to paddle far out to sea--the weather\r\nbeing fortunately calm--and to rest for a day and a night as well as\r\nthey could in their frail bark.  Maximus sat in the stern of the canoe\r\nand steered; his wife sat in the bow and paddled day after day as\r\nvigorously as if she had been a man.  As for poor Old Moggy, she sat in\r\nthe middle and paddled a little when she felt cold; but she slept during\r\nthe greater part of the journey.  Chimo conceived it to be his duty to\r\nenjoy himself, and did so accordingly, at all times and in every\r\npossible way.\r\n\r\nDuring that livelong day and night, and all the following day, the\r\ngiant's arm never flagged; Aneetka, too, rested only once or twice at\r\nthe earnest request of her husband; but the little bark never once\r\nslackened its speed until the second night.  Then Old Moggy was\r\nawakened.\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" said Aneetka, who acted as interpreter between her husband and\r\nthe old woman, \"we want to sleep for an hour or two.  You seem to have\r\nrested well.  Will you wake and watch?\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman yawned, rubbed her eyes, and assented, after the question\r\nhad been twice repeated.  Then laying their heads on opposite sides of\r\nthe canoe, without otherwise changing their positions, the husband and\r\nwife sank into repose.\r\n\r\nTwo hours afterwards the old Indian woman, who had remained motionless\r\nas a dark statue all the time, uttered a slight sound.  Instantly the\r\nsleepers awoke, for those who are in the midst of danger sleep lightly.\r\n\r\n\"It is time to go on,\" said the old woman, as she lay back again in her\r\nlair, rolled herself up into a bundle, and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nMaximus and his wife resumed their paddles, and the light craft glided\r\nswiftly on its way to the far north.\r\n\r\nAs the sun rose they neared the land, and soon after they were seated\r\nnot far from a high cliff, eating their breakfast beside a small fire,\r\nwhich sent so thin a column of smoke into the air that it was almost\r\ndissipated ere it reached the tree-tops.  It was hoped that the Indians\r\nhad been now so far overshot that there was no danger of even a\r\nstraggler being near them.  But they took the precaution to load their\r\ntwo guns with ball, and lean them against a tree within reach of their\r\nhands.  When the meal was over, Maximus retired from the fire a few\r\npaces, and throwing himself at full length on the green moss beneath a\r\ntree, he fell into a sound sleep.\r\n\r\nHe had not lain thus more than quarter of an hour when he was startled\r\nby the report of a gun, which was followed by a wild scream and a chorus\r\nof unearthly yells.  At the same instant, and ere he could attempt to\r\nrise, his legs and arms were pinioned to the ground by four powerful\r\nIndians.  For an instant Maximus was paralysed.  Then the terrible\r\nreality of his position, the scream of Aneetka, and the sight of the\r\nthong with which his captors were about to bind him, caused his spirit\r\nto rebound with a degree of violence that lent him for the moment the\r\nstrength of a giant.  With a shout, in which even a tone of contempt\r\nseemed to mingle the Esquimau hurled his captors right and left, and\r\nsprang to his feet.  The Indians fled; but one, who was a moment later\r\nin rising than the others, received a blow that felled him instantly.\r\nMaximus glanced quickly round in search of his wife, and observed her\r\nbeing hurried away by two Indians.  As the arrow leaps from the bow the\r\nEsquimau sprang forward in pursuit.  The Indians saw him coming.  In\r\nbitter anger they prepared to let her go and fly, for having dropped\r\ntheir guns in the scuffle they were unable to fire upon their\r\napproaching foe.  But there were other Indians in the bush whose weapons\r\nwere levelled at the breast of Maximus, and the next moment would have\r\nbeen his last, but for a stone thrown from the cliffs above, which\r\nstruck him on the forehead and stretched him bleeding and insensible\r\nupon the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen Maximus recovered from the effects of the blow, he found himself\r\nlying on the cold earth in total darkness, and firmly bound hand and\r\nfoot.  It is impossible to describe the agony of that bold spirit as he\r\nlay writhing on the ground, in the vain effort to burst the cords that\r\nbound him.  He thought of Aneetka and his own utter helplessness, while\r\nshe was, no doubt, in urgent need of his strong arm to deliver her.  The\r\nthought maddened him, and again he strove in vain to burst his fetters,\r\nand yelled aloud in despair.  The echoing rocks gave back his cry, and\r\nthen all was silence.  The dreadful thought now flashed across him that\r\nthe Indians had buried him alive in some dark cavern, and brave though\r\nhe was, he trembled in every limb with agony.\r\n\r\nThus Maximus lay until the grey dawn shone in upon him, and showed that\r\nhe was in a cave.  Scarcely had he noted this fact when the figure of a\r\nman darkened the cave's mouth and approached him.  As the Indian bent\r\nover his helpless foe he revealed the savage features of Meestagoosh.\r\nFor an instant he cast a look of mingled hatred and triumph on his\r\nenemy; then drawing a scalping-knife from his girdle, he stooped and cut\r\nthe thong that bound his feet, at the same time signing to him to rise,\r\nfor he knew that Maximus did not understand Indian.  The Esquimau\r\nobeyed, and was led by the Indian through the woods towards the cliff\r\nwhere the struggle of the previous night had taken place.  Here they\r\ncame suddenly into view of the Indian camp.\r\n\r\nThere were no tents: several green blankets that lay on the moss under\r\nthe trees indicated where the party had lain during the night; and at a\r\nconsiderable distance apart from these sat Old Moggy, with her face\r\nburied in her skinny hands.  Beside her stood Aneetka, with a calm but\r\nslightly anxious expression on her pale countenance.  Chimo was held in\r\na leash by an Indian.  From the fact of the Indians being without tents\r\nor women, and having their faces daubed with red paint, besides being\r\narmed with knives, guns, and tomahawks, Maximus concluded that they\r\ncomposed a war party.\r\n\r\nOn seeing her husband, Aneetka uttered a suppressed cry and bounded\r\ntowards him; but ere she had proceeded two paces an Indian laid his hand\r\non her arm, and led her back to where the old woman sat.  Meestagoosh\r\nled Maximus to the same spot, and having confronted him with his wife,\r\nhe said to the latter,--\"Now, she-bear of the north, translate between\r\nus.  If I think you tell lies, the dogs shall have your bones to pick.\"\r\n\r\nAneetka replied meekly, \"You cannot hurt one hair of our heads unless\r\nthe Great Spirit permit you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall see,\" retorted the Indian with a scornful laugh.  \"Tell the\r\npolar bear,\" continued Meestagoosh, in a contemptuous tone, \"that I did\r\nnot expect to catch him so soon.  I have been fortunate.  It was kind of\r\nhim to come in my way, and to bring his she-bear with him.  Tell him\r\nthat I and my braves are going to pay a visit to his nation, to take a\r\nfew scalps.  I let him know this piece of good news because he will\r\nnever know it from his friends, as he shall be food for dog very soon.\"\r\n\r\nOn this being translated, the face of Maximus assumed an expression of\r\ndeep gravity mingled with sadness.  His mind flew to the far north, and\r\nhe thought of the midnight assault and the death-cry of women and\r\nchildren.  The nature of the Esquimau was too noble and generous to be\r\neasily ruffled by the contemptuous tone of such a man as Meestagoosh;\r\nbut his heart sank within him when he thought of the power as well as\r\nthe will that the Indian had to put his threat into execution.\r\n\r\n\"Tell him,\" said Maximus quietly, \"that I have no wish to talk with him,\r\nbut remind him that Indians are not gods; they are men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he says truly,\" retorted Meestagoosh, \"the Indians are men, but\r\nEsquimaux are dogs.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation was going on, and the Indians were intent upon\r\nthe scene, Old Moggy, who was not deemed worthy of being noticed,\r\ncontrived unobserved to possess herself of a knife, and springing\r\nsuddenly towards Maximus with an agility of which she seemed utterly\r\nincapable, she endeavoured to cut the thongs that bound his arms.  Her\r\nhand was caught, however, by Meestagoosh, in time to frustrate her\r\nintention.  Without deigning a word of remark, the Indian struck her a\r\nheavy blow on the cheek with the back of his open hand, which nearly\r\nstunned her.  Staggering backward, she fell upon the ground with a low\r\nwail.\r\n\r\nThe bosom of Maximus felt as if it would burst with rage.  Before any\r\none could prevent him, he raised his foot and struck Meestagoosh so\r\nviolently on the chest that he fell as if he had been shot.  In a moment\r\nhe recovered, drew his knife, and springing like an infuriated tiger at\r\nhis enemy, drove it with deadly force at his throat.  Fortunately the\r\narms of Maximus were tied in front of him, so that by raising them he\r\nwas enabled to guard his chest and receive the stab on his wrist.  The\r\nknife passed quite through the fleshy part of his left arm, but in doing\r\nso it severed one of the cords that bound him.  Thought is not quicker\r\nthan the mighty wrench with which the Esquimau burst the remaining cord\r\nand dashed his opponent to the ground.  Before the astonished Indians\r\ncould level their guns, Maximus had seized Aneetka in his arms and was\r\nbounding madly towards the cliff, which was not more than fifty yards\r\ndistant.  Every gun poured forth its deadly contents before he gained\r\nit; but his very nearness to the Indians seemed to contribute to his\r\nsafety, and the suddenness of his flight rendered their hasty aim\r\nuncertain.  In another moment he was round the point and behind the\r\nsheltering cliff, while the Indians uttered a terrific yell and darted\r\nforward in pursuit.  Just about thirty paces beyond the point of the\r\ncliff that hid him for a few moments from view was the cave in which\r\nMaximus had spent the night.  Quick as thought he sprang up the steep\r\nshort ascent that led to its narrow entrance and darted in.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he placed Aneetka behind a projection that formed an ample\r\nshelter at the mouth of the cave, when Chimo, who had broken from his\r\ncaptors, also darted in and crouched at his master's feet.  Meanwhile\r\nthe Indians came sweeping round the point, and seeing by the entrance of\r\nthe dog where the fugitives had taken shelter, they bounded up the\r\nascent.  The first who reached the cave's mouth rashly passed the\r\nentrance.  Ere he could fire his piece he received a blow from the fist\r\nof the Esquimau that fractured his skull, hurled him down the steep\r\nascent, and dashed him against his comrades in the rear.  This sudden\r\nrepulse effectually checked the Indians, who are notoriously bad at\r\nstorming.  Indeed they would never have ventured to enter the cave in\r\nthis manner had they not known that Maximus was totally unarmed.\r\n\r\nWithdrawing to a distance of about forty yards, the Indians now formed\r\nin a line, and loading their guns, fired volley after volley into the\r\ncave's mouth.  But Maximus and his wife crouched with the dog behind the\r\nledge of rock at the entrance, and remained there in perfect safety.  In\r\na few minutes the Indians ceased firing, and one of their number\r\ncautiously approached the cave, supposing, no doubt, that the fusillade\r\nmust have wounded if it had not killed those within; but the instant he\r\npassed the entrance, knife in hand, he was caught in the powerful arms\r\nof Maximus and hurled down the slope.\r\n\r\nA yell of indignation from the Indians followed this feat, and another\r\nvolley was fired into the cave, but without effect; and the savages,\r\nseeing that it was impossible in this way to dislodge their foe,\r\nassembled in a group to consult.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Old Moggy had made good use of the opportunity thus afforded\r\nher to effect her escape.  She darted into the bushes and made for the\r\nrocky ground in the rear of the camp.  In doing so she happened to pass\r\nthe tree against which leaned the two guns belonging to her friends.\r\nThey had escaped notice during the _melee_ of the previous day, and,\r\nwith the shot-belts and powder-horns, remained where they had been\r\nplaced when she and her companions landed.  The old woman eagerly seized\r\nthese, and clambered with them over the rocks at a rate that would have\r\ndone credit to more youthful limbs.  On reaching a ridge of rock that\r\noverlooked the cave where Maximus was sheltered, Old Moggy became aware\r\nof how matters stood.  She could also see, from her elevated position,\r\nthat a track, or the bed of a dried-up watercourse, led through the\r\nbushes towards the cave.  Without a moment's delay she descended it;\r\nbut, on drawing near to the cave, she found that there was a barren spot\r\nof about thirty yards in extent between the place of refuge and the edge\r\nof the bushes.  This open space was completely exposed to the view of\r\nthe natives, who at that time were firing across it into the cavern;\r\nfor, after their consultation, they had changed their position and\r\nrenewed the fusillade.  Moggy was now in despair.  She knew that it\r\nwould be impossible to pass the open ground without being shot, and she\r\nalso felt certain that, when the Indians found their present attempts\r\nwere fruitless, they would resort to others, in prosecuting which they\r\nwould in all probability discover her.  While she meditated thus, she\r\nlooked earnestly towards the cave, and observed the astonished gaze of\r\nMaximus fixed upon her; for, from his position behind the ledge of rock,\r\nhe could see the old woman without exposing himself to the Indians.\r\nWhile they gazed at each other a thought occurred to Old Moggy.  She\r\nmade a series of complicated signs, which, after frequent repetition,\r\nwere understood by Maximus to mean that he was to expose himself to the\r\nview of the Indians.  Instantly comprehending her meaning, the Esquimau\r\nstepped boldly from his place of concealment and shook his fist\r\ncontemptuously in the face of his enemies.  A shower of bullets and a\r\nyell of rage followed the act.  This was just what Old Moggy had\r\nexpected and desired.  Not a gun remained undischarged, and before they\r\ncould reload, she passed quickly over the open ground and bounded into\r\nthe cave, where she turned and shook aloft the two guns with a hoarse\r\nlaugh of triumph ere she sought the shelter of the ledge of rock.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were so filled with fury at being thus outwitted by an old\r\nwoman, that they forgot for a moment their usual caution, and rushed in\r\na body up the slope; but ere they had accomplished half the distance two\r\nof their number fell, to rise no more.  This was sufficient to check\r\ntheir career.  Howling with baffled rage, and without waiting to pick up\r\ntheir fallen comrades, they darted right and left to seek the shelter of\r\nthe bushes, for they could no longer remain in the open ground, now that\r\ntheir enemies were armed.\r\n\r\nFor nearly an hour after this all was silence.  Maximus and his\r\ncompanions could only form conjectures as to the movements of the\r\nIndians, for none of them were to be seen.  However, as they had no\r\nresource but to remain in their retreat until night-fall, they\r\nendeavoured to make the place as comfortable as possible, and busied\r\nthemselves in cleaning their arms.\r\n\r\nIt happened that from the cave's mouth they could see their canoe, which\r\nstill lay on the beach where they had originally left it; and, while\r\nthey were looking at it, they perceived one of the Indians stealing down\r\ntowards it.  Fortunately Maximus had a gun in his hand ready loaded, and\r\nthe instant the Indian appeared he fired and shot him.  No second Indian\r\ndared to venture towards the little craft, although it lay only a few\r\nyards distant from the edge of the forest; for they knew that the\r\nwatchful eye of the Esquimau was upon them, and that instant death would\r\nbe the fate of him who should make the attempt.  The little canoe now\r\nbecame an object of intense interest to both parties.  The Indians knew\r\nthat if their foe should succeed in reaching it he could easily escape.\r\nThis, of course, he could not hope to do as long as daylight lasted; nor\r\neven when night should arrive, unless it were a very dark one.  But, on\r\nthe other hand, they knew that they did not dare to venture near it so\r\nlong as there was sufficient light to enable Maximus to take aim at them\r\nwith his deadly gun.  Both parties, therefore, remained silent and\r\napparently inactive during the remainder of the day.\r\n\r\nBut the busy brains both of Indians and Esquimaux were, during this\r\nweary interval, employed in planning how to circumvent each other.  As\r\nthe shades of night deepened, each became more watchful.  Once only did\r\nMaximus move from his post, in order to go to the farther end of the\r\ncave, where the large powder-horn had been placed for safety.  As he did\r\nso, Chimo, who was tied to a rock, tried to follow him, and on finding\r\nthat he was restrained, uttered a loud, mournful howl.  This cry sent a\r\nthrill to the heart of Maximus, for it immediately occurred to him that\r\nany attempt to leave the cave stealthily would instantly be intimated to\r\nthe watchful foe by the dog, and to take Chimo with them was impossible.\r\n\r\n\"The dog must die,\" said Old Moggy, who divined at once what was passing\r\nin the man's mind.\r\n\r\nMaximus shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot kill Chimo,\" he said to Aneetka; \"he is Edith's dog.\"\r\n\r\nAneetka made no reply, for she felt the power of her husband's objection\r\nto injure the dog of his little favourite; yet she could not but\r\nperceive that the cry--which was invariably repeated when any of the\r\nparty moved away from the animal--would betray them in the moment of\r\ndanger.  Nothing further was said for some time, but Old Moggy, who had\r\nno tender reminiscences or feelings in regard to the dog, proceeded\r\nquietly and significantly to construct a running-noose on the stout\r\nthong of leather that encircled her waist and served as a sash.\r\n\r\nWhile she was thus engaged the sun's last rays faded away and the night\r\nbegan to deepen around them.  To the satisfaction of both parties the\r\nsky was draped with heavy clouds, which gave promise of a night of\r\nintense darkness.  This was absolutely essential not only to the Indians\r\nbut to Maximus, who had at length formed a plan by which he hoped to\r\nturn the dreaded cry of the dog to good account, although he had little\r\nhope of saving it from the Indians, should he succeed in escaping with\r\nthe women.  As the night grew darker he began to put this plan in\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nTaking his station at the entrance of the cave, he took a long and\r\nsteady aim at the bow of the canoe, which could now be only seen dimly.\r\nHaving adjusted the gun to his satisfaction he marked its position\r\nexactly on the rock, so that, when the canoe should be entirely hid from\r\nsight, he could make certain of hitting any object directly in front of\r\nit.  Then he ordered Moggy and his wife to keep moving about the cave,\r\nso that the howling of Chimo should be kept up continually, and thus not\r\nappear unusual when they should really forsake the cave and attempt\r\ntheir escape.  In order to show that he was still on the alert, he\r\nshortly after aimed at the canoe, which was now quite invisible, and\r\nfired.  The effect was more startling than had been expected.  A\r\ndeath-cry rent the air and mingled with the reverberations of the shot,\r\nproving that it had taken deadly effect on one of the Indians, who,\r\nunder cover of the darkness, had ventured to approach the coveted canoe.\r\nA volley was instantly fired in the direction of the cave from various\r\nparts of the bushes, but without effect.\r\n\r\nMaximus now kept up a continued fire, sometimes discharging a succession\r\nof rapid shots, at other times firing at irregular intervals of from\r\nthree to ten minutes.  This he did purposely, with a view to his future\r\nplans.  In the meantime the dog was made to keep up a continuous\r\nhowling.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Aneetka,\" said Maximus, as the ring of his last shot died away,\r\n\"go, and may the Great Spirit guide thee!\"\r\n\r\nWithout a word of reply, the two women glided noiselessly like shadows\r\ninto the thick darkness.  About two minutes after they had disappeared,\r\nMaximus again fired several shots, taking care, however, to point\r\nconsiderably to the right of the canoe.  Then he ceased for three\r\nminutes, and again fired several shots irregularly.  At the last shot he\r\npassed from the cave so silently and quickly that even Chimo was\r\ndeceived, and snuffed the air for a moment ere it renewed its sad\r\nwailing.  In less than two minutes the Esquimau had glided, with the\r\nnoiseless tread of a panther, to the spot where the canoe lay.  Here he\r\nfound his wife and the old woman crouching beside it.  The water's edge\r\nwas about ten yards distant.  A few seconds would suffice to lift the\r\nlight bark in his powerful arms and launch it.  Aneetka and the old\r\nwoman, who had already received minute instructions what to do, had\r\nglided quietly into the sea the instant Maximus touched them; for, as we\r\nhave said, it was intensely dark and they could not see a yard before\r\nthem.  The women now stood up to the knees in water, with their paddles\r\nin their hands ready to embark.\r\n\r\nStooping down, the Esquimau seized the canoe; but, just as he was about\r\nto lift it, he observed a tall dark object close to his side.\r\n\r\n\"Wah!\" whispered the Indian, \"you are before me.  Quick! the Esquimau\r\ndog will fire again.\"\r\n\r\nThe words of the Indian were cut short by the iron gripe of Maximus on\r\nhis throat, and the next instant he was felled by a blow that would have\r\nstunned an ox.  So decided and quick was the action that it was not\r\naccompanied by more noise than might have been caused by the Indian\r\nendeavouring to lift the canoe, so that his comrades were not alarmed.\r\nNext moment the canoe was in the water.  But the long silence, which had\r\nnow been unbroken for eight or ten minutes, except by the howling of\r\nChimo in the cave, began to arouse the suspicion of the red men; and no\r\nsooner was this the case than they glided from the bushes in all\r\ndirections with noiseless tread.  In a second or two the body of their\r\nfallen comrade was discovered, and a yell of fury rent the air (for\r\nconcealment was now unnecessary), while they dashed into the water in\r\npursuit.  The darkness favoured the fugitives for a few seconds, and\r\nenabled the women to embark; but just as Maximus was about to step into\r\nhis place, Meestagoosh seized him by the throat!\r\n\r\nMaximus was possessed of that ready presence of mind and prompt energy\r\nof character which are so necessary to a warrior, especially to him who\r\nwars with the prowling and stealthy savage.  Almost in the same instant\r\nhe gave the canoe a shove that sent it bounding out to sea, and raised\r\nhis hand to catch the invisible arm which he knew must be descending\r\nwith the deadly knife towards his heart.  He succeeded so far that,\r\nalthough he did not arrest it, he turned the blow aside, receiving only\r\na slight wound on the shoulder.  Ere it could be repeated, he dealt his\r\nadversary a blow on the forehead, and hurled him back insensible into\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nThe Esquimau immediately glided out into deep water; and now, for the\r\nfirst time in his life, he felt keenly the disadvantage of not being\r\nable to swim.  This is an art which the inhabitants of the icy seas have\r\nnever acquired, owing probably to the shortness of the season of open\r\nwater, and the intense cold of the ice-laden seas, even in summer.  The\r\nIndians, on the contrary, who live beside the warm lakes and rivers of\r\nthe interior, are many of them pretty expert swimmers.  Thus it happened\r\nthat Maximus was obliged to stand up to his neck in the water, not\r\ndaring to move or utter a sound, while his friends and foes alike sought\r\nin vain for him in the darkness.\r\n\r\nWhile he stood thus, uncertain how to act, he heard the water rippling\r\nnear to him, and distinguished the hard breathing of a swimmer.  Soon he\r\nobserved a dark head making straight towards him.  A sarcastic smile\r\nplayed for a moment on the face of the gigantic Esquimau, as he thought\r\nof the ease with which he should crush his approaching foe; and his hand\r\nwas already raised to strike when it was arrested by a low whine, and\r\nthe next moment Chimo was endeavouring to clamber upon his shoulder!\r\n\r\nIt instantly occurred to Maximus that he might turn the dog's swimming\r\npowers to good account.  Seizing Chimo by the flanks with both hands, he\r\nturned its head out to sea, and keeping it in that position, was dragged\r\ninto deep water.  When he had been thus conveyed what appeared to be\r\nabout fifty yards, he uttered a low cry.  He was heard by the Indians as\r\nwell as by those in the canoe; but the latter happened to be nearer to\r\nthe spot, and a few strokes of the paddles sent them alongside of their\r\ncomrade, who quickly caught the stern of the bark.  The women plied\r\ntheir paddles, the Esquimau gave a shout of triumph, and half immersed\r\nin the water, was dragged away from shore.  A yell of anger, and, soon\r\nafter, a desultory discharge of firearms, told that the Indians had\r\ngiven up the chase.\r\n\r\nBut it was now a question how Maximus was to be got into the canoe.  The\r\nfrail bark was so crank that a much lighter weight than that of the\r\nburly Esquimau would have upset it easily; and as the stern was sharp,\r\nthere was no possibility of climbing over it.  This was a matter of\r\nconsiderable anxiety, for the water was excessively cold, being laden\r\nwith ice out at sea.  While in this dilemma, the canoe grated on a rock,\r\nand it was discovered that in the dark they had well-nigh run against a\r\nlow cape that jutted far out from the land at this part of the coast.\r\nHere Maximus and the dog landed, and while the one shook its wet sides,\r\nthe other wrung the moisture from his garments; after which necessary\r\noperation he leaped, with his canine friend, into the canoe, and they\r\npushed well out to sea.\r\n\r\nWhen daylight returned, they were far beyond the reach of their Indian\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY SIX.\r\n\r\nHAPPY MEETINGS AND JOYOUS FEASTINGS--LOVE, MARRIAGE, DESERTION,\r\nDESOLATION, AND CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nAfter the escape narrated in the last chapter, the stout Esquimau and\r\nhis companions travelled in safety; for they had passed the country of\r\nthe Indians, and were now near the lands of their own people.\r\n\r\nBut if Maximus had not now to fight with men, he was not exempted from\r\ndoing fierce battle with the elements of these inhospitable climes.  For\r\nhundreds of miles he travelled along the east coast of Hudson's Bay and\r\nthe southern shores of the Straits, now driven ashore by the storm, anon\r\ninterrupted by drift-ice, and obliged to carry his canoe for miles and\r\nmiles on his shoulders, while the faithful Aneetka trudged by his side,\r\nhappy as the day was long; for, although her load was necessarily a\r\nheavy one, her love for Maximus made it rest lighter than the eider-down\r\nthat floated from her fingers when she plucked the wild birds for their\r\nevening meal.  Moggy, too, waddled along after her own fashion, with a\r\nresolution and energy that said much for her strength and constitution.\r\nShe only carried the light paddles and a few trifling articles that did\r\nnot incommode her much.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring and summer and autumn they pursued their arduous\r\njourney, living from hand to mouth on the produce of their guns, nets,\r\nseal-spears, and fishing-lines, which generally supplied them with\r\nenough for their daily wants, sometimes with abundance, but not\r\nunfrequently with just sufficient to keep them alive.  Three or four\r\ntimes they met with Esquimaux, and rendered essential service to them,\r\nand to the fur-traders, by telling them of the new fort at Ungava,\r\nrecounting the wonders of the store there, and assuring them that the\r\nchief desire of the traders, after getting their furs, was to do them\r\ngood, and bring about friendly intercourse between them and the Indians.\r\n\r\nLate in the autumn the three voyageurs drew near to Ungava Bay, and in\r\npassing along the coast opposite to the island on which Edith had spent\r\nthe winter, they overtook Annatock and his whole tribe, with a flotilla\r\nof oomiaks and kayaks, on their way to the same place.  At the mouth of\r\nthe bay they were joined by the Esquimaux of False River, who were\r\ncarrying supplies of seal-blubber to the fort for the use of the dogs in\r\nwinter, and a few deerskins to trade.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright and beautiful autumn afternoon (a rare blessing in that\r\ndreary clime) when they passed the narrows of the river, and came in\r\nsight of Fort Chimo.\r\n\r\nOn that day an unusually successful deer-hunt had taken place, and the\r\nfiddle had, as Bryan expressed it, been \"sarved out\" to the men, for the\r\npurpose of rejoicing their hearts with sweet sounds.  On that day a\r\nsmall band of Indians had arrived with a rich and unusually large stock\r\nof furs, among which there were one or two silver foxes and a choice lot\r\nof superb martens.  This tended to gladden the heart of Stanley; and\r\ntruly he needed such encouragement.  At one of the Company's inland\r\ntrading-posts such a bundle of furs would have been received as a matter\r\nof common occurrence; but it was otherwise with the poverty-stricken\r\nUngava, from which so much had been expected before its dreary, barren\r\ncharacter was known.\r\n\r\nOn that day, too, a picturesque iceberg had grounded near the fort at\r\nhigh water, and Frank took Edith in the small canoe to paddle her among\r\nits peaked and fantastic fragments.\r\n\r\n\"You will be steersman and sit in the stern, Eda,\" said Frank, as they\r\nembarked.  \"I will stand in the bow and keep you clear of ice-tongues.\"\r\n\r\n\"How beautiful!\" exclaimed the delighted child, as their light craft\r\nglided in and out among the icy pinnacles which overhung them in some\r\nplaces as they passed.  \"Don't you hear a strange noise, Frank?\"\r\n\r\nTruly Frank did hear a strange noise, and beheld a strange sight, for at\r\nthat moment the Esquimau flotilla passed the narrows and swept round the\r\nbay; while the natives, excited by their unusual numbers and the\r\nunexpected return of Maximus, yelled and screamed and threw about their\r\narms in a manner that defies description.\r\n\r\n\"There must be strangers among them,\" said Frank, as he paddled towards\r\nthe shore; \"they are too numerous for our friends of False River.\"\r\n\r\n\"That seems to be an Indian canoe coming on ahead,\" remarked Stanley,\r\nwho, along with his wife and most of the men, had hurried to the beach\r\non hearing the shouts of the approaching multitude.\r\n\r\n\"Can it be possible?\" exclaimed Frank, as the canoe drew near; \"does it\r\nnot look like Maximus--eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! o-o-o-oh! there's Chimo!\" screamed Edith, her eyes dancing with\r\nmingled amazement and delight.\r\n\r\nThe dog in his anxiety to reach the shore had leaped into the water; but\r\nhe had miscalculated his powers of swimming, for the canoe instantly\r\ndarted ahead.  However, he was close on the heels of Maximus.\r\n\r\n\"Give him a chare, bays,\" cried Bryan, as he ran down to the beach\r\nwaving a large hammer round his head.  \"Now thin, hooray!\"\r\n\r\nThe appeal was responded to with heartfelt energy by the whole party, as\r\ntheir old comrade sprang from the canoe, and leaving his wife to look\r\nafter herself, ran toward Stanley and Frank and grasped them warmly by\r\nthe hands, while his huge face beamed with emotion.\r\n\r\n\"I hope that's your wife you've brought with you, Maximus,\" said\r\nStanley.\r\n\r\n\"I can answer for that,\" said Frank; \"I know her pretty face well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! le poor chien,\" cried La Roche; \"it vill eat Miss Edith, I ver'\r\nmuch b'lieve, voila!\"\r\n\r\nThis seemed not unlikely, for the joy manifested by poor Chimo at the\r\nsight of his young mistress was of a most outrageous character, insomuch\r\nthat the child was nearly overturned by the dog's caresses.\r\n\r\n\"Musha! what have ye got there, Maximus?\" said Bryan, who had been\r\ngazing for some time past in solemn wonder at the figure of Old Moggy,\r\nwho, regardless of the noise and excitement around her, was quietly\r\ncarrying the goods and chattels from the canoe to the beach.  \"Shure\r\nye've found yer ould grandmother.  She's the mortial parsonification of\r\nmy own mother.  Faix if it wasn't that her proboscis is a taste longer,\r\nI'd swear it was herself.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point Massan stepped forward and took Maximus by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Come along, lad; there's too much row here for a comfortable palaver;\r\nbring your wife wi' you.  Ye've run out o' baccy, now?  Of coorse ye\r\nhave.  Come, then, to the house; I'll fill yer pipe and pouch, too,\r\nboy.--See after his canoe, La Roche; and bring the old ooman, Bryan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mind yer own consarns an' let yer shupariors proceed ye,\" said Bryan,\r\nas he shoved past, and tucking Old Moggy's arm within his own, marched\r\noff in triumph to the fort.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the main body of Esquimaux had landed, and the noise and\r\nconfusion on the shore were so great that scarcely an intelligible sound\r\ncould be heard.  In the midst of all this, and while yet engaged in\r\ncaressing Chimo, Edith felt some one pluck her by the sleeve, and on\r\nlooking round she beheld the smiling faces of her old friends Arnalooa\r\nand Okatook.  Scarcely had she bestowed a hearty welcome on them, when\r\nshe was startled by an ecstatic yell of treble laughter close to her\r\near; and turning quickly round, she beheld the oily visage of Kaga with\r\nthe baby--_the_ baby--in her hood, stark naked, and revelling in mirth\r\nas if that emotion of the mind were its native element--as indeed it\r\nwas, if taken in connection with seal-fat.\r\n\r\nScarcely had she recovered from her delight at this meeting, when she\r\nwas again startled by a terrific shout, and immediately after Peetoot\r\nperformed a violent dance around her, expressive of unutterable joy, and\r\nfinished off by suddenly seizing her in his arms, after which he fled,\r\nhorrified at his own presumption.\r\n\r\nTo escape from this scene of confusion the traders returned to the fort,\r\nhaving directed the Esquimaux to pitch their camp on the point below;\r\nafter which they were to assemble in the yard, for the double purpose of\r\npalavering and receiving a present of tobacco.\r\n\r\nThat night was spent by the inhabitants of Fort Chimo in rejoicing.  In\r\nher own little room Edith entertained a select tea-party, composed of\r\nArnalooa, Okatook, Peetoot, Chimo, and the baby; and really it would be\r\ndifficult to say which of them made most noise or which behaved most\r\nobstreperously.  Upon mature consideration we think that Chimo behaved\r\nbest; but that, all things considered, is not saying much for him.  We\r\nrather think the baby behaved worst.  Its oily visage shone again like a\r\nlustrous blob of fat, and its dimples glided about the surface in an\r\nendless game of hide-and-seek!  As for Peetoot, he laughed and yelled\r\nuntil the tears ran over his cheeks, and more than once, in the excess\r\nof his glee, he rubbed noses with Chimo--a piece of familiarity which\r\nthat sagacious animal was at length induced to resent and put a stop to\r\nby a gentle and partial display of two tremendous rows of white ivory.\r\n\r\nIn the hall Stanley held a levee that lasted the greater part of the\r\nevening; and in the men's house a ball was got up in honour of the\r\ngiant's return with his long-lost Aneetka.\r\n\r\nAh, reader! although the countenances of the men assembled there were\r\nsunburnt and rough, and their garments weather-worn and coarse, and\r\ntheir language and tones unpolished, think not that their hearts were\r\nless tender or sympathetic than the hearts of those who are nurtured in\r\nsofter scenes than the wilds of Ungava.  Their laugh was loud and\r\nuproarious, it is true, but there was genuine, heartfelt reality in it.\r\nTheir sympathy was boisterously expressed, mayhap, if expressed at all,\r\nbut it was truly and deeply felt, and many an unbidden tear glanced from\r\nthe bronzed cheeks of these stalwart men of the north, as they shook\r\ntheir gigantic comrade by the hand and wished him joy, and kissed his\r\nblooming bride.\r\n\r\nAneetka had long since laid aside her native garb, and wore the more\r\ngraceful and womanly costume of the Indian women, and Maximus wore the\r\ncapote and leggings of the voyageur.  But there were not wanting\r\ngentlemen from the camp at the point whose hairy garments and hoods,\r\nlong hair and beards, did honour to the race of the Esquimaux; and there\r\nwere present ladies from the same place, each of whom could a _tail_\r\nunfold that would have been the admiration and envy of tadpoles, had any\r\nsuch creatures been there to see them.  They wore boots too, to which,\r\nin width at least, those worn by fishermen are nothing.  Some of them\r\ncarried babies in their hoods--little naked imps, whose bodies and heads\r\nwere dumplings (suet dumplings, we may add, for the information of the\r\ncurious), and whose arms and legs were sausages.\r\n\r\nBryan was great that night--he was majestic!  The fiddle all but spoke,\r\nand produced a sensation of dancing in the toes of even those who\r\nhappened to be seated.  Bryan was great as a linguist, too, and\r\nexhibited his powers in this respect with singular felicity in the vocal\r\nentertainment that followed the dancing.  The Esquimau language seemed a\r\nmere trifle to him, and he conversed, while playing the violin, with\r\nseveral \"purty craytures\" in their native tongue, with an amount of\r\nvolubility quite surprising.  Certainly it cannot be said that those\r\nwhom he addressed expressed much intelligence; but Esquimaux are not\r\nusually found to be quick in their perceptions.  Perchance Bryan was\r\nmetaphysical!\r\n\r\nMirth, hearty, _real_ mirth reigned at the fort, not only that day, but\r\nfor many a day afterwards; for the dangers, and troubles, and anxieties\r\nof the first year were past.  Hope in the future was strong, despite the\r\npartial failures that had been experienced; and through the goodness of\r\nGod, all those who composed the original band of the \"forlorn hope\" were\r\nreunited, after many weary months of travel, danger, and anxiety, during\r\npart of which a dark and dreary cloud (now happily dispelled) had\r\nsettled down on Fort Chimo.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYears have rolled away since the song and shout of the fur-trader first\r\nawakened the echoes of Ungava.  Its general aspect is still the same,\r\nfor there is no change in the everlasting hills.  In summer the deer\r\nstill wander down the dark ravines and lave their flanks in the river's\r\nswelling tide, and in winter the frost-smoke still darkens the air and\r\nbroods above the open water of the sea; but Fort Chimo, the joy and\r\nwonder of the Esquimaux and the hope of the fur-trader, is gone, and a\r\ngreen patch of herbage near the flat rock beside the spring alone\r\nremains to mark the spot where once it stood.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time the changes that took place in the arrangements of\r\nthe Fur Company required the presence of Stanley at another station, and\r\nhe left Ungava with his wife and child.  The gentleman who succeeded him\r\nwas a bold, enterprising Scottish Highlander, whose experience in the\r\nfur trade and energy of character were a sufficient guarantee that the\r\nbest and the utmost would be done for the interests of the Company in\r\nthat quarter.  But however resolute a man may be, he cannot make furs of\r\nhard rocks, nor convert a scene of desolation into a source of wealth.\r\nVigorously he wrought and long he suffered, but at length he was\r\ncompelled to advise the abandonment of the station.  The Governor of the\r\nCompany--a man of extraordinary energy and success in developing the\r\nresources of the sterile domains over which he ruled--was fain to admit\r\nat last that the trade of Ungava would not pay.  The order to retreat\r\nwas as prompt and decisive as the command to advance.  A vessel was sent\r\nout to remove the goods, and in a brief space of time Fort Chimo was\r\ndismantled and deserted.\r\n\r\nThe Esquimaux and Indians soon tore down and appropriated to their own\r\nuse the frames of the buildings, and such of the materials of the fort\r\nas had been left standing; and the few remnants that were deemed\r\nworthless were finally swept away and every trace of them obliterated by\r\nthe howling storms that rage almost continually around these desolate\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nAnd now, reader, it remains for me to dismiss the characters who have\r\nplayed their part in this brief tale.  Of most of them, however, I have\r\nbut little to say, for they are still alive, scattered far and wide\r\nthroughout the vast wilderness of Rupert's Land, each acting his busy\r\npart in a new scene; for it is frequently the fate of those who enter\r\nthis wild and stirring service to be associated for a brief season under\r\none roof, and then broken up and scattered over the land, never again to\r\nbe reunited.\r\n\r\nGeorge Stanley, after a long sojourn in the backwoods, retired from the\r\nservice, and, with his family, proceeded to Canada, where he purchased a\r\nsmall farm.  Here Edith waxed strong and beautiful, and committed\r\nappalling havoc among the hearts of the young men for thirty miles\r\naround her father's farm.  But she favoured no one, and at the age of\r\nseventeen acquired the name of being the coldest as well as the most\r\nbeautiful and modest girl in the far west.\r\n\r\nThere was a thin young man, with weak limbs and a tendency to fall into\r\na desponding state of mind, who lived about three miles from Mr\r\nStanley's farm.  This young man's feelings had been so often lacerated\r\nby hopes and fears in reference to the fair Edith, that he mounted his\r\npony one evening in desperation, and galloped away in hot haste to\r\ndeclare his passion, and realise or blast his hopes for ever.  As he\r\napproached the villa, however, he experienced a sensation of emptiness\r\nabout the region of the stomach, and regretted that he had not taken\r\nmore food at dinner.  Having passed the garden gate, he dismounted,\r\nfastened his pony to a tree, and struck across the shrubbery towards the\r\nhouse with trembling steps.  As he proceeded, he received a terrific\r\nshock by observing the flutter of a scarf, which he knew intuitively\r\nbelonged to Edith.  The scarf disappeared within a bower which stood not\r\nmore than twenty yards distant from him, close beside the avenue that\r\nled to the house.  By taking two steps forward he could have seen Edith,\r\nas she sat in the bower gazing with a pensive look at the distant\r\nprospect of hill and dale, river and lake, in the midst of which she\r\ndwelt; but the young man could as easily have leaped over Stanley's\r\nvilla, farm and all, as have taken these two steps.  He essayed to do\r\nso; but he was rooted to the ground as firmly as the noble trees under\r\nwhich he stood.  At length, by a great effort, he managed to crawl--if\r\nwe may so express it--to within a few yards of the bower, from which he\r\nwas now concealed only by a few bushes; but just as he had screwed up\r\nhis soul to the sticking point, and had shut his eyes preparatory to\r\nmaking a rush and flinging himself on his knees at Edith's feet, he was\r\nstruck powerless by the sound of a deep sigh, and, a moment after, was\r\nall but annihilated by a cough!\r\n\r\nSuddenly the sound of horse-hoofs was heard clattering up the avenue.\r\nOn came the rider, as if in urgent haste.  In a few seconds a curve in\r\nthe avenue brought him into view.  He was a man of handsome and massive\r\nproportions, and bestrode a black charger that might have carried a\r\nheavy dragoon like a feather.  A wheel-barrow had been left across the\r\ntrack, over which the steed went with an easy yet heavy bound,\r\nbetokening well-balanced strength and weight; and a bright smile lighted\r\nup the rider's bronzed face for an instant, as his straw-hat blew off in\r\nthe leap and permitted his curling hair to stream out in the wind.  As\r\nhe passed the bower at a swinging gallop, an exclamation of surprise\r\nfrom Edith attracted his attention.  The charger's hoofs spurned the\r\ngravel while he was reined up so violently that he was thrown on his\r\nhaunches, and almost before the thin young man could wink in order to\r\nclear his vision, this slashing cavalier sprang to the ground and\r\nentered the bower.\r\n\r\nThere was a faint scream, which was instantly followed by a sound so\r\npeculiar that it sent a thrill of dismay to the cavity in which the\r\nheart of the weak young man had once lodged.  Stretching out his hand he\r\nturned aside the branches, and was brought to the climax of\r\nconsternation by beholding Edith in the arms of the tall stranger!\r\nBewildered in the intellect, and effectually crippled about the knees\r\nand ankles, he could only gaze and listen.\r\n\r\n\"So you have come--at last!\" whispered Edith, while a brilliant blush\r\noverspread her fair cheek.\r\n\r\n\"O Edith!\" murmured the stalwart cavalier, in a deep musical voice, \"how\r\nmy heart has yearned for this day!  How I have longed to hear your sweet\r\nand well-remembered voice!  In the desolate solitudes of the far north I\r\nhave thought of you.  Amid the silent glades of the forest, when alone\r\nand asleep on my mossy couch or upon my bed of snow, I have dreamed of\r\nyou--dreamed of you as you were, a fair, sweet, happy child, when we\r\nwandered together among the mountains of Ungava--and dreamed of you as I\r\nfancied you must have become, and as I now find you to be.  Yes, beloved\r\ngirl, my heart has owned but one image since we parted, years ago, on\r\nthe banks of the Caniapuscaw River.  Your letters have been my bosom\r\nfriends in all my long, long wanderings through the wilderness; and the\r\nhope of seeing you has gladdened my heart and nerved my arm.  I have\r\nheard your sighs in every gentle air that stirred the trees, and your\r\nmerry laugh in the rippling waters.  Even in the tempest's roar and the\r\nthundering cataract I have fancied that I heard you calling for\r\nassistance; and many a time and oft I have leaped from my couch to find\r\nthat I did but dream.  But they were pleasant and very precious dreams\r\nto me.  O Edith!  I have remembered you, and thought of you, and loved\r\nyou, through months and years of banishment!  And now--\"\r\n\r\nAgain was heard the peculiar sound that had thrilled with dismay the\r\nbosom of the weak young man.\r\n\r\n\"Halo! whence came this charger?\" shouted a hale, hearty voice, as\r\nStanley walked towards the bower.  \"Eh! what have we here?\" he\r\nexclaimed, rushing forward and seizing the stranger in his\r\narms,--\"Frank--Frank Morton!\"\r\n\r\nThis was too much.  The weak young man suddenly became strong as\r\nHercules.  He turned and fled down the avenue like a deer.  The pony,\r\nhaving managed to unfasten its bridle, stood in the centre of the way\r\ngazing down the avenue with its back towards its master.  Unwonted fire\r\nnerved the youth's limbs; with one bound he vaulted leap frog over the\r\nanimal's back into the saddle, dashed his spurs into its sides, and fled\r\nlike a whirlwind from the scene of his despair.\r\n\r\nFrank Morton and George Stanley, being both men of promptitude and\r\ndecision, resolved that one month was long enough to make preparations\r\nfor the marriage; and Edith, being the most dutiful daughter that ever\r\nlived, did what she was bid.\r\n\r\nThat beautiful cottage which stands in the midst of most exquisite\r\nscenery, about two miles from Stanley's villa, is inhabited by Frank\r\nMorton and his family.  That crow which you have just heard proceed from\r\nthe nursery was uttered by the youngest of five; and yonder little boy\r\nwith broad shoulders, who thrusts his hands into his pockets in a\r\ndecided manner, and whistles vociferously as he swaggers down the\r\navenue, is Master George F. Morton, on his way to school.\r\n\r\nLa Roche and Bryan were so fortunate as to be appointed to the same\r\nestablishment after leaving Ungava--somewhere near the mouth of the\r\nMackenzie River, and within the region of all but perpetual frost and\r\nsnow.  They are sometimes visited by Esquimaux, which is fortunate; for,\r\nas Bryan says, \"it guves him an opportunity o' studyin' the peecoolier\r\ndialects o' their lingo.\"\r\n\r\nDick Prince was the only one who lost his life in the \"forlorn-hope.\"\r\nHe was drowned while out shooting in the bay alone in his canoe.  A\r\nsudden storm upset his frail bark and left him struggling in the water.\r\nPrince was a strong swimmer, and he battled long for his life; but the\r\nice-laden sea benumbed his hardy limbs, and he sank at last, without a\r\ncry, to rise no more.  He was a noble specimen of his class--a brave,\r\nmodest, unobtrusive son of the forest, beloved and respected by his\r\ncompanions; and when his warm heart ceased to beat, it was felt by all\r\nthat a bright star of the wilderness had been quenched for ever.  His\r\nbody was found next day on the beach, and was interred by his mourning\r\ncomrades in a little spot of ground behind the fort.  It was many a long\r\nday after this melancholy event ere Massan could smile; and when the\r\nfort was finally deserted, he put in practice his long-meditated\r\nintention of becoming a hunter and taking to the Rocky Mountains, where\r\nhe wanders now, if he has escaped the claws of the dreaded grizzly bear\r\nand the scalping-knife of the Red Indian.\r\n\r\nMoses, finding the life of a fur-trader not quite to his taste, rejoined\r\nhis countrymen, and reverted to killing seals and eating raw blubber.\r\nThe two Indians also returned to a purely savage life, which, indeed,\r\nthey had only forsaken for a time.  Augustus and Oolibuck died; and the\r\nlatter left a son, who has already rendered good service as interpreter\r\nto the arctic expeditions, as his worthy father did before him.\r\nFrancois and Gaspard are still together at one of the posts of the\r\ninterior.  They are now fast friends, and have many a talk over the days\r\nwhen they quarrelled and messed together at Fort Chimo.\r\n\r\nAs for the poor Esquimaux, they were for a time quite inconsolable at\r\nthe departure of the fur-traders, and with a species of childlike\r\nsimplicity, hung about the bay, in the hope that they might, after all,\r\nreturn.  Then they went off in a body to the westward, and the region of\r\nUngava, to which they had never been partial, was left in its original\r\ndreary solitude.  It may be that some good had been done to the souls of\r\nthese poor natives during their brief intercourse with the traders.  We\r\ncannot tell, and we refrain from guessing or speculating on a subject so\r\nserious.  But of this we are assured--if one grain of the good seed has\r\nbeen sown, it may long lie dormant, but it _cannot_ die.\r\n\r\nMaximus accompanied his countrymen, along with Aneetka and Old Moggy,\r\nwho soon assumed the native costume, and completely identified herself\r\nwith the Esquimaux.  Maximus was now a great man among his people, who\r\nregarded with deep respect the man who had travelled through the lands\r\nof the Indians, had fought with the red men, single-handed, and had\r\nvisited the fur-traders of the south.  But the travelled Esquimaux was\r\nin reality a greater man than his fellows supposed him to be.  He fully\r\nappreciated the advantages to be derived from a trading-post near their\r\nice-girt lands, and resolved, when opportunity should offer, to do all\r\nin his power to strengthen the friendship now subsisting between the\r\nIndians and the Esquimaux of Ungava, and to induce his countrymen, if\r\npossible, to travel south towards the establishment on James's Bay.\r\n\r\nHe still retains, however, a lingering affection for the spot where he\r\nhad spent so many happy days, and at least once a year he undertakes a\r\nsolitary journey to the rugged mountains that encircled Fort Chimo.  As\r\nin days of yore, with wallet on shoulder and seal-spear in hand, the\r\ngiant strides from rock to rock along the now silent banks of the\r\nCaniapuscaw River.  Once again he seats himself on the flat rock beside\r\nthe spring, and gazes round in sadness on those wild, majestic hills, or\r\nbends his eye upon the bright green spot that indicates the ancient site\r\nof the trading-post, not a vestige of which is now visible, save the\r\nlittle wooden cross that marks the lonely grave of Dick Prince; and the\r\nbroad chest of the giant heaves with emotion as he views these records\r\nof the past, and calls to mind the merry shouts and joyous songs that\r\nused to gladden that dreary spot, the warm hearth at which he was wont\r\nto find a hearty welcome, and the kind comrades who are now gone for\r\never.  Ungava spreads, in all its dark sterility, around him, as it did\r\nin the days before the traders landed there; and that bright interval of\r\nbusy life, in which he had acted so prominent a part, seems now but the\r\nfleeting fancy of a bright and pleasant dream.\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
