The whole has been revised, and much new matter is added\r\nthroughout. A new Chapter at the end on the Past, the Present, and the\r\nFuture of Indian Tea will, it is hoped, be found interesting. An Index\r\n(a great want to the First Edition) is added, so that all information\r\non any point can be at once found. The manufacture of Green Tea, of\r\nwhich I was ignorant when I last wrote, is given, and the advisability\r\nof that manufacture is discussed.\r\n\r\nIn its present form I hope and believe this little work will be found\r\nuseful and interesting to all connected with Tea.\r\n\r\n          EDWARD MONEY.\r\n\r\n  DARJEELING,\r\n  _May, 1874_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following Essay was written with, _firstly_, the object of\r\ncompeting for the Gold Medal and the Money Prize offered by the\r\nAgricultural and Horticultural Society of India for the best treatise\r\non the cultivation and manufacture of Tea; and, _secondly_, with the\r\nview of arranging the hundreds of notes on these subjects, which, in\r\nthe course of eleven years, I had collected.\r\n\r\nDuring all these years I have been a Tea planter, making first for\r\nmyself and others a garden in the Himalayas, and for the last six years\r\ndoing the same thing for myself in the Chittagong district.\r\n\r\nWhenever I have visited other plantations (and I have seen a great\r\nnumber in many districts), I have brought away notes of all I saw. Up\r\nto the last, at every such visit, I have learnt _something_--if rarely\r\nnothing to follow, something at least to avoid. I have now tested all\r\nand everything connected with the cultivation and manufacture of Tea\r\nby my own experience, and I can only hope that what I have written\r\nwill be found useful to an industry destined yet, I believe, in spite\r\nof the late panic--the natural result of wild speculation--to play an\r\nimportant part in India.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to adapt this Essay to the wants of a beginner, as\r\nthere are many of that class now, and may yet be more in days to come,\r\nwho must feel, as I often have, the want of a really practical work on\r\nTea.\r\n\r\nTo those who have Tea properties in unlikely climates and unlikely\r\nsites, I would say two words. No view I have taken of the advantages of\r\ndifferent localities _can_ in any way affect the results of enterprises\r\nalready entered upon. But if the note of warning, sounded in the\r\nfollowing pages, checks further losses in Tea, already so vast, while\r\nit fosters the cultivation on remunerative sites, I shall not have\r\nwritten in vain.\r\n\r\n          EDWARD MONEY.\r\n\r\n  SUNGOO RIVER PLANTATION,\r\n  CHITTAGONG,\r\n  _November, 1870_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                           PAGE\r\n\r\n       I.

Simply\r\n  because nothing will pay, which is embarked on without the requisite\r\n  knowledge; and this was pre-eminently the case with Tea.\r\n\r\nNothing was known of Tea formerly, when everybody rushed into it; not\r\nmuch is known even now. Still, with those drawbacks and many others,\r\nthe enterprise has survived, and it is very certain the day will never\r\ncome that Tea cultivation will cease in India.\r\n\r\nI believe there is nothing will pay better than Tea, if embarked on\r\nwith the necessary knowledge in suitable places, but failing either of\r\nthese success must not be hoped for.\r\n\r\nIt was madness to expect aught but ruin, under the conditions which the\r\ncultivation was entered on in the Tea-fever days. People who had failed\r\nin everything else were thought quite competent to make plantations.\r\n’Tis true Tea was so entirely a new thing at that time, but few could\r\nbe found who had any knowledge of it. Still, had managers with some\r\npractice in agriculture been chosen, the end would not have been so\r\ndisastrous. But any one--literally any one--was taken, and tea planters\r\nin those days were a strange medley of retired or cashiered army and\r\nnavy officers, medical men, engineers, veterinary surgeons, steamer\r\ncaptains, chemists, shop-keepers of all kinds, stable-keepers, used-up\r\npolicemen, clerks, and goodness knows who besides!\r\n\r\nIs it strange the enterprise failed in their hands? Would it not have\r\nbeen much stranger if it had not?\r\n\r\nThis was only one of the many necessities for failure. I call them\r\n“necessities” as they appear to have been so industriously sought after\r\nin some cases. I must detail them shortly, for to expatiate on them\r\nwould fill a book.\r\n\r\nNo garden should exceed 500 acres under Tea. If highly cultivated one\r\nof even half that size will pay enormously, far better than a larger\r\narea with low cultivation. Add, say, 400 acres for charcoal, &c.,\r\nmaking 900 or say 1,000 acres the outside area that can be required,\r\nand the outside that should ever have been purchased for any one\r\nestate. Instead of this, individuals and Companies rushing into Tea\r\nbought tracts of five, ten, fifteen, and twenty thousand acres. The\r\nidea was that, though it might not be all cultivated, by taking up\r\nso large an area all the local labour where there was any would be\r\nsecured. Often, however, these large tracts were purchased where local\r\nlabour there was none, and what the object there was is a mystery.\r\nI conceive, however, there was a hazy idea that _if_ 500 acres paid\r\nwell, 1,000 would pay double, and that eventually even two or three\r\nthousand acres would be put under Tea and make the fortunate possessor\r\na _millionaire_. In short, there were no bounds, in fancy, to the size\r\na garden might be made, and thus loss No. 2 took place when absurdly\r\nlarge areas were bought of the Government and large areas cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe only fair rules for the sale of waste lands were those of Lord\r\nCanning, which the Secretary of State at home, who could know nothing\r\nof the subject, chose to modify and upset. Instead of Rs. 2-8 per acre\r\nfor all waste lands (by no means a low price, when the cost of land\r\nin the Colonies is considered) and that the applicant for the land\r\n(who had, perhaps, spent months seeking for it) should have it, the\r\nilliberal and unjust method of putting the land up to auction with an\r\nupset price of Rs. 2-8 was adopted, the unfortunate seeker, finder,\r\nand applicant, through whose labour the land had been found, having no\r\nadvantage over any other bidder. The best, at least the most successful\r\nplan in those days, though as unfair and illiberal as the Government\r\naction, was to wait till some one, who was supposed to know what good\r\nTea land was, applied for a piece, and then bid half an anna more than\r\nhe did, and thus secure it. It _paid_ much better than hunting about\r\nfor oneself, and it was kind and considerate on the part of Government\r\nto devise such a plan!\r\n\r\nIn those fever days, with the auction system, lands almost always sold\r\nfar above their value. The most absurd prices, Rs. 10 and upwards\r\nper acre, were sometimes paid for wild jungle lands. Tracts, which\r\nnatives could have, and in some cases _did_ lease from Government for\r\ninconceivably small sums, representing, say, at thirty years’ purchase,\r\n4 annas per acre, were put up for auction with a limit of Rs. 2-8, and\r\nsold perhaps at Rs. 8 or 10 per acre. Had the Government given land\r\n_gratis_ to Tea cultivators the policy would have been a wise one. To\r\ndo what they did was scarcely acting up to their professed wish “to\r\ndevelope the resources of the country.”\r\n\r\nSince the above was written, new rules have been published for the sale\r\nof waste lands. The objectionable auction system is continued, and the\r\nupset price is much enhanced, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Schedule of Rates of Upset Prices._\r\n\r\n                                           Upset price per acre.\r\n  Districts of the Assam Division                Rs. 8\r\n  Districts of Cachar and Sylhet                     8\r\n  Districts of the Chittagong Division               6\r\n  Districts of the Chota Nagpore Division            5\r\n  The Soonderbuns                                    5\r\n  All other Districts                               10\r\n\r\nIt is not likely that Government will sell much land at such exorbitant\r\nrates.[1]\r\n\r\nSecurity of title, it is generally thought, is one of the advantages\r\nof buying land from the State; but I grieve to state my experience is\r\nthat the reverse is the case, and will so remain until the following is\r\ndone:--\r\n\r\n_First._ The Government should learn _what is and what is not theirs to\r\nsell_. Such an absurdity, then, as Government ascertaining, years after\r\nthe auction, that they had sold lands they had no right to sell, could\r\nnot be.\r\n\r\n_Secondly._ That before land is sold it be properly surveyed and\r\ndemarcated; and what might so easily have been done, and which alone\r\nwould have compensated for much of bad procedure in other respects,\r\nthat the simple and obvious plan before the sale, of sending a European\r\nofficial to show the neighbouring villagers and intending purchasers\r\nthe boundaries of the land to be sold, be resorted to.\r\n\r\nThis last simple expedient would have saved some grantees years of\r\nlitigation, and many a hard thought of the said grantees against the\r\nGovernment. It would naturally occur to any one at all conversant with\r\nthe subject; but, _alas!_ in India this is often not the condition\r\nunder which laws are made.\r\n\r\nBut there is another difficulty at the back of all this.\r\n\r\nThough the Waste Land Rules enact that the Government, and not the\r\ngrantee, shall be the defendant in any claim for land within a lot\r\nsold, practically the said enactment in no way saves grantees from\r\nlitigation. Claimants for land always plead that it is _not_ within\r\nthe boundaries of the land sold, and _ergo_ the grantee is made the\r\ndefendant to prove that it is. The villagers never having been shown\r\nthe boundaries by any Government official (for it is not enacted in the\r\nWaste Land Rules), the question whether the land claimed is within or\r\nwithout the boundaries is an open one, not always easily decided, and\r\nthe suit runs its course.\r\n\r\nI even know of cases where, though survey has been charged for at\r\nthe exorbitant rate of four annas an acre, the outer boundaries of\r\nthe lot have never been surveyed at all, but merely copied from old\r\nCollectorate maps, which showed the boundaries between the zemindaree\r\nand waste lands.[2] Is it strange, then, if buying lands from\r\nGovernment is often buying litigation, worry, loss of time and money.\r\n\r\nIn many countries, for example Prussia (there I know it is so, for I\r\nhave tested it again and again), there are official records which can\r\nand do show to whom any land in question belongs. This may scarcely be\r\npracticable in India, but surely the question of title being, as it\r\nis, in a far worse state in India than in most countries, any change\r\nwould be for the better. Anyhow, the present mode the Government adopts\r\nin selling lands is a grievous wrong to the purchasers. Words cannot\r\ndescribe the worry and loss some have suffered thereby, and it might\r\nall be so easily avoided.\r\n\r\nI have above detailed two of the drawbacks Tea had to contend with in\r\nits infancy; the absurdly high price paid for land was the third.\r\n\r\nAgain, companies and proprietors of gardens wishing to have large\r\nareas under cultivation gave their managers simple orders to extend,\r\nnot judiciously, but in any case. What was the result? Gardens might\r\nbe seen in those days with 200 acres of so-called cultivation, but\r\nwith 60 or even 70 per cent. vacancies, in which the greater part of\r\nthe labour available was employed in clearing jungle for 100 acres\r\nfurther extension in the following spring. I have seen no garden in\r\nAssam or Cachar with less than 20 per cent. vacancies, many with far\r\nmore; and yet most of them were extending. I do not believe _now_ any\r\ngarden in all India exists with less than 12 per cent. vacancies, but\r\na plantation as full as this did _not_ exist formerly.\r\n\r\nAs the expenditure on a garden is in direct proportion to the area\r\ncultivated, and the yield of Tea likewise in direct proportion to the\r\nnumber of plants, it follows the course adopted was the one exactly\r\ncalculated to entail the greatest expenditure for the smallest yield.\r\nThis unnecessary, this wilful extension, was the fourth and a very\r\nserious drawback.\r\n\r\nUnder this head the fourth drawback may also be included--the fact\r\nthat the weeds in all plantations were _ahead_ of the labour; that is\r\nto say, that gardens were not kept clean. This is more or less even\r\nthe case to-day; it was the invariable rule then. The consequence was\r\ntwo-fold--_first_, a small yield of Tea; _secondly_, an increased\r\nexpenditure; for it is a fact that the land fifty men can keep always\r\nclean, if the weeds are never allowed to grow to maturity and seed,\r\nwill take nearer one hundred if the weeds once get ahead. The results,\r\ntoo, differ widely: in the first case the soil is always clear; in\r\nthe second clear only at intervals. The first, as observed, can be\r\naccomplished with fifty, the latter will take nearly double the men.\r\n\r\nThe fifth drawback I shall advert to again later, _viz._, the selection\r\nof sloping land, often the steepest that could be found, on which to\r\nplant Tea. The great mischief thus entailed will be fully described\r\nelsewhere. It was the fifth, and not the least, antagonistic point to\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nNumber six was the difficulty in the transport of seed to any new\r\nlocality, for nine times out of ten a large proportion failed; and\r\nagain the enormous cost of Tea seed in those days, Rs. 200 a maund (Rs.\r\n500 at least, deducting what failed, was its real price). This item of\r\nseed alone entailed an enormous outlay, and was the sixth difficulty\r\nTea cultivation had to contend with. It was, however, a source of great\r\nprofit to the old plantations, and principally accounts for the large\r\ndividends paid for years by the Assam Company.\r\n\r\nAgain, many managers at that time had no experience to guide them in\r\nthe manufacture of Tea; each made it his own way, and often turned out\r\nmost worthless stuff. There is great ignorance on the subject at the\r\npresent time, but those who know _least_ to-day, know _more_ than the\r\nbest informed in the Tea-fever period. Indian Tea was a new thing then;\r\nthe supply was small, and it fetched comparatively much higher prices\r\nthan it does now. Still much of it was so bad that the average price\r\nall round was low.\r\n\r\nTea manufacture, moreover, as generally practised then, was a much\r\nmore elaborate and expensive process than it is now.\r\n\r\nThis will be explained further on, under the head of “Tea Manufacture;”\r\nI merely now state the fact in support of the assertion that the bad\r\nTea made in those days, and the expensive way it was done, was the\r\nseventh hindrance to successful Tea cultivation.\r\n\r\nOften in those days was a small garden made of 30 or 40 acres, and sold\r\nto a Company as 150 or 200 acres! I am not joking. It was done over\r\nand over again. The price paid, moreover, was quite out of proportion\r\nto even the supposed area. Two or three lakhs of rupees (20,000_l._ or\r\n30,000_l._) have been often paid for such gardens, when not more than\r\ntwo years old, and 40 per cent. of the existing area, vacancies. The\r\noriginal cultivators “retired” and the Company carried on. With such\r\ndrags upon them (apart from all the other drawbacks enumerated) could\r\nsuccess be even hoped for? Certainly not.\r\n\r\nI could tell of more difficulties the cultivation had to contend with\r\nat the outset, but I have said enough to show, as I remarked, “that it\r\nwas not strange Tea enterprise failed, inasmuch as it would have been\r\nmuch stranger if it had not.”\r\n\r\nDo any of the difficulties enumerated exist now? And may a person\r\nembarking in Tea to-day hope, with reasonable hope, for success? Yes,\r\ncertainly, I think as regard the latter--the former let us look into.[3]\r\n\r\nPeople who understand more or less of Tea are plentiful, and a good\r\nmanager, who knows Tea cultivation and Tea manufacture well, may be\r\nfound. It will scarcely pay to buy land of the Government at the\r\npresent high rates, but many people hold large tracts in good Tea\r\nlocalities, and would readily sell.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of flat land to be got, so no evil from slopes need be\r\nincurred.\r\n\r\nTea seed is plentiful and cheap.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of Tea (though still progressing) is simple,\r\neconomical, and more or less known. Anyhow a beginner now will commence\r\nwhere others have left off.\r\n\r\nOf course to buy a made garden cheap is better than to make one; but\r\nthe result in this case is of course no criterion of what profit may be\r\nexpected from Tea cultivation.\r\n\r\nAs many of the items to be calculated under the heads of cultivation,\r\nmanufacture, and receipts will be better understood after details on\r\nthese subjects are gone into, I shall reserve the consideration of “how\r\nmuch profit Tea can give” to the end of this treatise.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Since the Second Edition went to press, further Rules for Waste\r\nLands have been enacted. Generally speaking, they are only now leased\r\nto applicants.\r\n\r\n[2] I need scarcely observe it is impossible to define lands from maps\r\nalone without the field-book.\r\n\r\n[3] Note to Third Edition.--Since the above was written, Teas, both\r\nIndian and Chinese, have had a heavy fall, due to the simple fact that\r\nthe supplies have exceeded the demands. But with increased knowledge\r\nand experience, producers can afford to sell cheaper, and the present\r\nabsurdly low prices ruling will, I think, work their own cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLABOUR, LOCAL AND IMPORTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the very large amount of labour required to carry on a plantation\r\nis considered, it is evident that facilities for it are a _sine quâ\r\nnon_ to success. Assam and Cachar, the two largest Tea districts,\r\nare very thinly populated, and almost entirely dependent on imported\r\nlabour.[4] The expense of this is great, and it is the one, and\r\nconsequently a great drawback to those provinces. The only district\r\nI know of with a good Tea climate and abundance of local labour is\r\nChittagong.[5] Several other places have a good supply of local labour,\r\nbut then their climates are not very suitable.\r\n\r\nEach coolie imported costs Rs. 30 and upwards (it used to be much more)\r\nere he arrives on the garden and does any work. After arrival he has\r\nto be housed; to be cared for and _physicked_ when sick; to be paid\r\nwhen ill as when working; to have work found for him, or paid to sit\r\nidle when there is no work; and in addition to all this every death,\r\nevery desertion, is a loss to the garden of the whole sum expended in\r\nbringing the man or woman. Contrast this with the advantages of local\r\nlabour. In many cases no expense for buildings is necessary, as the\r\nlabourers come daily to work from adjacent villages, and in such cases\r\nno expense is entailed by sick men, for these simply remain at home.\r\nThere is no loss by death or desertions. When no work is required on\r\nthe garden, labour is simply not employed. All this makes local labour,\r\neven where the rate of wages is high, very much cheaper than imported.\r\n\r\nThe action of Government in the matter of imported labour has much\r\nincreased the difficulties and expense necessarily attendant on it.\r\nIt is a vexed and a very long question which I care not to enter into\r\nminutely, for it has been discussed already _ad nauseam_; still I must\r\nput on record my opinion, after looking very closely into it, that the\r\nGovernment has not acted wisely, inasmuch as any State interference in\r\nthe relations of employer and employed (outside the protection which\r\nthe existing laws give) is a radical mistake. As for the law passed\r\non the subject to the effect that a coolie who has worked out his\r\nagreement and voluntarily enters into a new one shall be, as before,\r\nunder Government protection, and his employer answerable as before to\r\nGovernment, for the way he is housed, treated when sick, &c., it is not\r\neasy to see why such enactments are more necessary in his case than in\r\nthat of any other hired servant or labourer throughout all India.\r\n\r\nAll evidence collected, all enquiries made, tend to show that\r\ncoolies are well treated on Tea estates. It is the interest of the\r\nproprietors and managers to do so, and self-interest is a far more\r\npowerful inducement than any the Government can devise. The meddling\r\ncaused by the visits of the “Protector of Coolies”[6] to a garden\r\nconduces to destroy the kind feelings which should (and in spite of\r\nthese hindrances often do) exist between the proprietor or manager\r\nand his men. I do not hesitate in my belief that imported coolies on\r\nTea plantations would be better off in many ways were all Government\r\ninterference abolished.\r\n\r\nI do not decry Government action to the extent of seeing the coolies\r\nunderstand their terms of engagements, and are cared for on their\r\njourney to the Tea districts; but once landed on the garden, all\r\nGovernment interference should cease.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the State laying down how many square yards of jungle each\r\ncoolie shall clear in a day, how many square feet he shall dig, &c.,\r\n&c.! Can _any_ certain rates be laid down for such work? Is all jungle\r\nthe same, all soil the same; and even if such rates _could_ be laid\r\ndown, how can the rules be followed? Bah! they are _not_, never will\r\nbe, and the whole thing is too childish for serious discussion.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to sit at a desk and frame laws and rules that\r\nlook feasible on paper. It is quite another thing to carry them out.\r\nOver-legislation is a crying evil in India, but there is still a worse,\r\nnamely, legislation and official action on subjects of which the said\r\nofficials are utterly ignorant.\r\n\r\nI have said enough to show imported labour cannot vie with local, nor\r\nwould it do so were all the evils of Government interference removed.\r\nI therefore believe Tea property in India will eventually pay best\r\nwhere local labour exists. This will naturally be the case when other\r\nconditions are equal, but so great are the advantages of local labour,\r\nI believe it will also be the case in spite of _moderate_ drawbacks.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Not so much so now as when this was first written.\r\n\r\n[5] Note to Third Edition.--A portion of the Western Dooars may perhaps\r\nbe added, but the labour, though adjacent, is not strictly local. Up\r\nto the present, however, I have had but little expense in importing\r\ncoolies to the gardens there in which I am interested.\r\n\r\n[6] What a designation! Who invented it, I wonder? A clever man,\r\ndoubtless, for Government interference was probably his hobby, and he\r\nquickly perceived the very title would, more or less, render the office\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTEA DISTRICTS AND THEIR COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES, CLIMATE, SOIL, ETC., IN\r\nEACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tea districts in India, that is, where Tea is grown in India\r\nto-day, are--[7]\r\n\r\n   1. Assam.\r\n   2. The Dehra Dhoon.\r\n   3. Kumaon (Himalayas).\r\n   4. Darjeeling (Himalayas).\r\n   5. Cachar and Sylhet.[8]\r\n   6. Kangra (Himalayas).\r\n   7. Hazareebaugh.\r\n   8. Chittagong.\r\n   9. Terai below Darjeeling.\r\n  10. Neilgherries (Madras Hills).\r\n  11. Western Dooars.\r\n\r\nIn fixing on any district to plant Tea in, four things have to be\r\nconsidered--viz., soil, climate, labour, and means of transport.\r\nWhen--the district being selected--a site has to be chosen, all but\r\nthe second of these have to be considered again, and the lay of land,\r\nnature of jungle, water, and sanitation are also of great importance in\r\nchoosing a site.\r\n\r\nI will first, then, discuss generally the Tea districts given above\r\nas regards the advantages of each for Tea cultivation. I have seen and\r\nstudied Tea gardens in all the districts named, except No. 2. What I\r\nknow of the Dehra Dhoon is from what I have read, and what is generally\r\nknown of the climate.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, comparing each district, we should know what are\r\nthe necessities of the Tea plant as regards climate and soil. Tea,\r\nespecially the China variety, will grow in very varying climates and\r\nsoils, but it will not flourish in all of them, and if it does not\r\nflourish, and flourish well, it will certainly not pay.\r\n\r\nThe climate required for Tea is a hot damp one. As a rule, a good Tea\r\nclimate is not a healthy one. The rainfall should not be less than 80\r\nto 100 inches per annum, and the more of this that falls in the early\r\npart of the year the better. Any climate which, though possessing\r\nan abundant rainfall, suffers from drought in the early part of the\r\nyear is not, _cæteris paribus_, so good as one where the rain is more\r\nequally diffused. _All_ the Tea districts would yield better with more\r\nrain in February, March, and April; and therefore some, where fogs\r\nprevail in the mornings at the early part of the year, are so far\r\nbenefited.\r\n\r\nAs any drought is prejudicial to Tea, it stands to reason hot winds\r\nmust be very bad. These winds argue great aridity, and the Tea plant\r\nluxuriates in continual moisture.\r\n\r\nThe less cold weather experienced where Tea is, the better for the\r\nplant. It can stand, and will grow in, great cold (freezing point,\r\nand lower in winter, is found in some places where Tea is), but I do\r\nnot think it will ever be grown to a profit on such sites. That Tea\r\nrequires a temperate climate was long believed and acted upon by many\r\nto their loss. The climate _cannot_ be too hot for Tea if the heat is\r\naccompanied with moisture.\r\n\r\nTea grown in temperate climes, such as moderate elevations in the\r\nHimalayas, is quite different to the Tea of hot moist climates, such as\r\nEastern Bengal. Some people like it better, and certainly the flavour\r\nis more delicate; but it is very much weaker, and the value of Indian\r\nTea (in the present state of the home market, where it is principally\r\nused for giving “body” to the washy stuff from China) consists in its\r\nstrength. Another all-important point in fixing on a climate for Tea\r\nis the fact, that apart from the strength the yield is double in hot,\r\nmoist climes, what it is in comparatively dry and temperate ones. A\r\nreally pleasant climate to live in _cannot_ be a good one for Tea. I\r\nmay now discuss the comparative merits of the different Tea districts.\r\n\r\n\r\nASSAM.\r\n\r\nThis is the principal home of the indigenous plant. The climate in\r\nthe northern portions is perfect, superior to the southern, as more\r\nrain falls in the spring. The climate of the whole of Assam, however,\r\nis very good for Tea. The Tea plant yields most abundantly when hot\r\nsunshine and showers intervene. For climate, then, I accord the first\r\nplace to Northern Assam. Southern Assam is, as observed, a little\r\ninferior.\r\n\r\nThe soil of this province is decidedly rich. In many places there is a\r\nconsiderable coating of decayed vegetation on the surface, and inasmuch\r\nas in all places where Tea has been or is likely to be planted it is\r\nstrictly virgin soil, considerable nourishment exists. The prevailing\r\nsoil also is light and friable, and thus, with the exception of the\r\nrich oak soil in parts of the Himalayas, Assam in this respect is\r\nsecond to none.\r\n\r\nAs regards labour we must certainly put it the last on the list. The\r\nAssamese, and they are scanty, won’t work, so the planters, with few\r\nexceptions, are dependent on imported coolies; and inasmuch as the\r\ndistance to bring them is enormous, the outlay on this head is large,\r\nand a sad drawback to successful Tea cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe Burhampootra--that vast river which runs from one end of Assam to\r\nthe other--gives an easy mode of export for the Tea, but still, owing\r\nto the distance from the sea-board, it cannot rank in this respect as\r\nhigh as some others.\r\n\r\n\r\nCACHAR.\r\n\r\nThe indigenous Tea is also found in a part of this province. The\r\nclimate differs but little from Assam. In one respect it is better;\r\nmore rain falls in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe soil is not equal to Assamese soil; it is more sandy, and lacks the\r\npower. Again, there is much more flat land fit for Tea cultivation in\r\nAssam, and there can be no doubt as to the advantage of level surfaces.\r\n\r\nAs regards transport Cachar has the advantage, for it has equally a\r\nwater-way, and is not so distant from Calcutta.\r\n\r\nThe labour aspect is much the same in the two provinces, both being\r\nalmost entirely dependent on imported coolies; but Cachar is nearer the\r\nlabour fields than Assam.\r\n\r\nHowever, after discussing separately the advantages of each province,\r\nI propose to draw up a tabular statement, which will show at a glance\r\nthe comparative merits of each on each point discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHITTAGONG.\r\n\r\nThis is a comparatively new locality for Tea. The climate is better\r\nthan Cachar in the one respect that there is less cold weather,\r\nbut inferior in the more important fact that much less rain falls\r\nin the spring. In this latter respect it is also inferior to Assam,\r\nparticularly to Northern Assam. There is one part of Chittagong, the\r\nHill Tracts (Tea has scarcely been much tried there yet), which, in\r\nthe fact of spring rains, is superior to other parts of the province,\r\nas also in soil, for it is much richer there. On the whole, however,\r\nChittagong must yield the palm to both Assam and Cachar on the score\r\nof climate, and also, I think, of soil. For though good rich tracts\r\nare occasionally met with, they are not so plentiful as in the two\r\nlast-named districts. Always, however, excepting the Hill Tracts of\r\nChittagong; there the soil is, I think, quite equal to either Assam or\r\nCachar.\r\n\r\nAs regards labour (a very essential point to successful Tea\r\ncultivation), Chittagong is most fortunate. With few exceptions (and\r\nthose only partial) all the plantations are carried on with local\r\nlabour, which--excepting for about two months, the rice-time--is\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nFor transport (being on the coast with a convenient harbour, a\r\ncontinually increasing trade, ships also running direct to and from\r\nEngland), it is very advantageously situated.\r\n\r\nChittagong possesses another advantage over all other Tea districts\r\nin its large supply of manure. The country is thickly populated, and\r\nnecessarily large herds of cattle exist. The natives do not use manure\r\nfor rice (almost the sole cultivation), and, consequently, planters can\r\nhave it almost for the asking. The enormous advantages of manure in\r\nTea cultivation are not yet generally appreciated: it will certainly\r\ndouble the ordinary yield of a Tea garden. A chapter is devoted to this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERAI BELOW DARJEELING.\r\n\r\nI have seen this, and the Tea in it, since I wrote the first edition of\r\nthis Essay.\r\n\r\nThe soil is _very_ good for Tea. The climate is also a good one, but\r\nthere is not as much rain in the early part of the year as planters\r\ncould wish. Much difficulty exists about labour, owing to the very\r\nunhealthy climate. As the jungle is cleared, however, this last\r\nobjection will be in a measure got over. As it stands now, it is\r\nperhaps the most unhealthy Tea locality in India.\r\n\r\nCommunication will be very easy when the Northern Bengal Railway is\r\nfinished, which it will be immediately.\r\n\r\nExcept in the point of salubrity (which is, however, an important one),\r\nI think this locality a favourable one for Tea.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEHRA DHOON.\r\n\r\nI have heard the first Tea in India was planted here. The lucky men,\r\ntwo officers, who commenced the plantation, sold it, I believe, in its\r\ninfancy, to a company for five lakhs of rupees. What visions did Tea\r\nhold forth in those days!\r\n\r\nIn climate the Dehra Dhoon is far from good. The hot dry weather of the\r\nNorth-west is not at all suited to the Tea plant. Hot winds shrivel it\r\nup, and though it recovers when the rains come down, it cannot thrive\r\nin such a climate. One fact will, I think, prove this. In favourable\r\nclimates, with good soil and moderate cultivation, 18 flushes or crops\r\nmay be taken from a plantation in a season. With like advantages, and\r\n_heavy_ manuring, 22 or even more may be had. In the “Selections from\r\nthe Records of the Government of India” on Tea, published in 1857 (a\r\nbook to which many owe their ruin), the following appears, showing how\r\nsmall are the number of flushes in the North-west:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Three general gatherings.]\r\n\r\n  _Method of gathering Tea Leaves._--The season for gathering leaves\r\n  generally commences about the beginning of April, and continues until\r\n  October; the number of gatherings varies, depending on the moistness\r\n  and dryness of the season. If the season be good, that is to say,\r\n  if rain falls in the cold weather and spring, and the general rains\r\n  be favourable, as many as five gatherings may be obtained. These,\r\n  however, may be reduced to three general periods for gathering--viz.,\r\n  from April to June, from July to August 15, and from September to\r\n  October 15. If the season be a dry one, no leaves ought to be taken\r\n  off the bushes after October 1, as by doing so they are apt to be\r\n  injured. If, however, there are good rains in September, leaves can\r\n  be pulled until October 15, but no later, as by this time they have\r\n  got hard and leathery and not fitted for making good Teas, and it\r\n  is necessary to give the plants good rest in order to recruit. Some\r\n  plants continue to throw out new leaves until the end of November;\r\n  but those formed during this month are generally small and tough.\r\n\r\nWhen this was written, the experience detailed related to Dehra Dhoon,\r\nthe Kumaon, and Kangra gardens, and we see that five flushes or\r\ngatherings are thought good. It however makes matters in this respect\r\n(far from a general fault in the said “Records”) worse than they are.\r\nTen and twelve flushes, with _high_ cultivation, can be got in the\r\nNorth-west. But what is this as against twenty and twenty-five?\r\n\r\nLabour is plentiful and cheap. The great distance from the coast makes\r\ntransport very expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\nKANGRA.\r\n\r\nThis is a charming valley, with a delightful climate more favourable\r\nto Tea than the Dehra Dhoon, still it is not a perfect Tea climate. It\r\nis too dry and too cold. The soil is good for Tea, better than that\r\nof the Dhoon, but inferior to some rich soils in the Himalayan oak\r\nforests. Local labour is obtainable at cheap rates. Distance makes\r\ntransport for export very difficult; but a good local market now exists\r\nin the Punjab, and a good deal of Tea is bought at the fairs, and taken\r\naway by the wild tribes over the border. With the limited cultivation\r\nthere, I should hope planters will find a market for all their produce.\r\nManure must be obtainable (manure had not been thought of for Tea when\r\nI visited Kangra), and if liberally applied, it will increase the yield\r\ngreatly.\r\n\r\nKangra is strictly a Himalayan district, but the elevation is moderate,\r\nif I remember right, about 3,000 feet, and the land is so slightly\r\nsloping it may almost be called level. A great advantage this over the\r\nsteep lands, on which most of the Himalayan gardens, many in Cachar,\r\nand some in Assam and Chittagong, are planted.\r\n\r\nKangra is _not_ the best place for a man who wants to make money by\r\nTea; but for one who would be content to settle there, and content to\r\nmake a livelihood by it, a more desirable spot with a more charming\r\nclimate could not be found. Land, however, is not easily procured.\r\n\r\nThe Teas produced in Kangra are of a peculiarly delicate flavour, and\r\nare consequently highly esteemed in the London market.\r\n\r\n\r\nDARJEELING.\r\n\r\nThis, too, I have seen since I published the first edition of this\r\nEssay. The elevation of the station, 6,900 feet, is far too great;\r\nbut plantations lower down do tolerably well (that is, well for hill\r\ngardens). The climate, like all hill climates, is too cold. As regards\r\ntransport the Darjeeling plantations will be well situated when the\r\nrailroad now constructing is finished. Like elevations in Darjeeling\r\nand Kumaon are in favour of the former, _first_, because the latitude\r\nis less; _secondly_, because Darjeeling has much more rain in the\r\nspring. I believe, therefore, that the hill plantations of Darjeeling\r\nhave a better chance of paying than the gardens in Kumaon, but, as\r\nstated before, no elevated gardens, that is, none in the Himalayas,\r\nhave any chance in the race against plantations in the plains, always\r\nproviding the latter are in a good Tea climate.\r\n\r\nIn two respects, however, Darjeeling is behind Kumaon. The soil is not\r\nso good, and the land is much steeper. It is more than absurd, some of\r\nthe steeps on which Tea is planted in the former; and such precipices\r\ncan, I am sure, never pay. Gardens, barely removed above the Terai\r\n(and there are such in Darjeeling), can scarcely be called “elevated,”\r\nand for them the remarks applied to the Terai are more fitting. As a\r\nbroad rule it should be recognised that the lower Tea is planted in the\r\nHimalayas the better chance it has.\r\n\r\nAll the plants in the Darjeeling gardens, with but few exceptions, are\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nThe China plant makes by far the best Green Tea, and I believe the\r\nDarjeeling gardens would pay much better than they do if they altered\r\ntheir manufacture from black to green. (See further on, under the head\r\nof Hazareebaugh, what has been done in this way.) All Himalayan gardens\r\nshould, in my opinion, make Green Tea (Kumaon has awoke to the fact),\r\nfor all have China plants, and can therefore make far better Green Tea\r\nthan can be produced from the Hybrid which is so general in plain\r\ngardens.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\nKUMAON.\r\n\r\nIt was in this district (a charming climate to live in, with\r\nmagnificent scenery to gaze at) I first planted Tea in India, and I\r\nmuch wish for my own sake, and that of others, I had not done so. I\r\nknew nothing of Tea at the time, and I thought a district selected by\r\nGovernment for inaugurating the cultivation must necessarily be a good\r\none. No hill climate _can_ be a good one for Tea; but the inner part of\r\nKumaon, very cold, owing to its elevation, high latitude, and distance\r\nfrom the plains, is a peculiarly bad one. Yet there it was Government\r\nmade nurseries, distributed seed gratis, recommended the site for\r\nTea (see the “Records” alluded to), and led many on to their ruin by\r\ndoing so. The intention of the Government was good, but the officers\r\nin charge of the enterprise were much to blame, perhaps not for making\r\nthe mistake at first (no one _at the first_ knew what climate was\r\nsuitable), but for perpetuating the mistake, when later very little\r\nenquiry would have revealed the truth. I believe it was guessed at by\r\nGovernment officials long ago, but it was easier to sing the old tune;\r\nand a very expensive song it has proved to many.[10]\r\n\r\nI need scarcely, after this, add that I do not approve of Kumaon for\r\nTea. An exhilarating and bracing climate for man is not suited to\r\nthe Tea plant. The district has one solitary advantage--rich soil.\r\nI have never seen richer, more productive land than exists in some\r\nof the Kumaon oak forests, but even this cannot in the case of Tea\r\ncounter-balance the climate. Any crop which does not require much heat\r\nand moisture will grow to perfection in that soil. Such potatoes as\r\nit produces! Were the difficulties of transport not so great, a small\r\nfortune might be made by growing them.\r\n\r\nCould any part of Kumaon answer for Tea it would be the lower\r\nelevations in the outer ranges of the hills, but these are precisely\r\nthe sites that have _not_ been chosen. Led, as in my own case, partly\r\nby the Government example, partly by the wish to be _out_ of sight of\r\nthe “horrid plains,” and _in_ sight of that glorious panorama the snowy\r\nrange, planters have chosen the interior of Kumaon. Some wisely (I was\r\nnot one of them) selected low sites, valleys sheltered from the cold\r\nwinds; but even their choice has not availed much. The frost in winter\r\nlingers longest in the valleys, and though doubtless the yield there is\r\nlarger, owing to the increased heat in summer, the young plants suffer\r\nmuch in the winter. The outer ranges, owing to the heat radiating from\r\nthe plains, are comparatively free from frost, but there again the soil\r\nis not so rich. Still they would unquestionably be preferable to the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nLabour is plentiful in Kumaon and very cheap--Rs. 4 per mensem.\r\nTransport is very expensive. It costs not a little to send Tea from the\r\ninterior over divers ranges of hills to the plains. It has then some\r\ndays’ journey by cart ere it meets the rail, to which 1,000 miles of\r\ncarriage on the railroad has to be added.\r\n\r\nSince the above was written, Kumaon has secured a good local market,\r\nand I believe sells most of its Tea unpacked to merchants who come from\r\nover the border to buy it.\r\n\r\nIt has also improved its position greatly by making Green Teas, for\r\nwhich, as observed before, the China plant is so well fitted. With\r\nthose two advantages, though the climate is inferior, I suspect that\r\nTea there now pays better than in Darjeeling.\r\n\r\nGurhwall is next to Kumaon, and so similar that I have not thought it\r\nnecessary to discuss it separately. The climate is the same, the soil\r\nas a rule not so good. There is one exception though, a plantation near\r\n“Lohba,” the Teas of which (owing, I conceive, to its peculiar soil)\r\ncommand high prices in the London market. The gardens, both in Kumaon\r\nand Gurhwall, have been generally much better cared for than those in\r\nEastern Bengal. As a rule they are private properties managed by the\r\nowners.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAZAREEBAUGH.\r\n\r\nThis district I have resided in since I wrote the first edition of this\r\nEssay. The climate is too dry, and hot winds are felt there. A great\r\ncompensation, though, is labour; it is more abundant and cheaper in\r\nthis district than in any other. The carriage is all by land, and it\r\nis some distance to the rail. But the Tea gardens at Hazareebaugh can\r\nnever vie with those in Eastern Bengal, inasmuch as the climate is very\r\ninferior. The soil is very poor.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEILGHERRIES.\r\n\r\nThe climate is superior to the Himalayan, for the frost is very slight.\r\nWere, however, more heat there in summer, it would be better.\r\n\r\nSome of the Teas have sold very well in the London market, for as\r\nregards delicacy of flavour they take a high place.\r\n\r\nThe soil is good, but the temperate climate which holds on these “blue\r\nmountains” is not favourable to a large produce.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN DOOARS.\r\n\r\nWhen the second edition of this work was printed, this district was\r\nunknown as Tea locality.\r\n\r\nMy attention was directed to it in 1874; I was the second who planted\r\nTea in it, and I have now completed a garden there.\r\n\r\nAs regards climate, soil, and lay of land, it is perfect, and I believe\r\nit will eventually prove the most paying district in India for Tea.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Bengal Railway, just opened, gives it great advantages for\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\nHaving now discussed each district, all of which, except the Dehra\r\nDhoon, I have seen, I give, in further elucidation, Meteorological\r\nTables. For those not mentioned in the tables I have failed to acquire\r\nthe necessary information.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are due to Dr. Coates, at Hazareebaugh, for his kindness in\r\nsupplying me with much of the data from which the following tables are\r\nframed:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF ELEVATION AND TEMPERATURE OF TEA LOCALITIES.\r\n\r\n_N.B.--The exact temperature of other Tea Districts not being known, I\r\nhave confined myself to these; but general remarks on the elevation and\r\ntemperature of other Tea localities will be found elsewhere._\r\n\r\n  +----------+-------------+---------+--------+---------+---------+-------\r\n  |Districts |  Place      |Elevation| Details|January  |February |  March\r\n  |          |             | in feet |        |         |         |\r\n  +----------+-------------+---------+--------+---------+---------+-------\r\n  |          |             |        {|Monthly}|   61·7  |   63·0  |   72·6\r\n  |         {|             |        {| Temp. }|         |         |\r\n  |         {|Goalparah    |   386  {|Do.

tabular statement of the respective\r\nadvantages of the various Tea districts as regards climate, labour, lay\r\nof land, soil, facilities of procuring manure and transport.\r\n\r\nIn importance I regard them in the order given. I place labour before\r\nsoil, because the fact is, in all the provinces suitable and good soil\r\nfor Tea can be found _somewhere_; and therefore, while soil is all\r\nimportant in selecting a site, it is secondary to labour in deciding\r\non a district. Lay of land comes after labour. When my information on\r\nany point is not sure I place a note of interrogation. Where advantages\r\nare equal, or nearly so, I give the same number, and the greater the\r\nadvantage of a district on the point treated in the column the smaller\r\nthe number. Thus, under the head of Climate, Assam is marked 1.\r\n\r\nAs the following table gives no information as to which of all the\r\ndistricts possesses the greatest advantages, _all things considered_,\r\nbut only gives my opinion of each under each head, and the subject\r\nclosed in this way would be unsatisfactory, I may state that, in my\r\nopinion, the choice should lie between the three first and the last on\r\nthe list; and my choice would be the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Comparative advantages of the Tea Districts in India as regards\r\nclimate, labour, lay of land, soil, manure, and transport._\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+-------+------+-----------+----+------+------------+\r\n  |    Tea Districts     |Climate|Labour|Lay of Land|Soil|Manure|  Transport |\r\n  +----------------------+-------+------+-----------+----+------+------------+\r\n  |Assam                 |  1    |  4   |     1     |  1 |   4  | 3}         |\r\n  |Cachar                |  2    |  4   |     2     |  2 |   4  | 2} Water   |\r\n  |Chittagong            |  3    |  2   |     2     |  2 |   1  | 1} carriage|\r\n  |Chittagong Hill Tracts|  3    |  3   |     3     |  1 |   2  | 1}         |\r\n  |Terai below Darjeeling|  2    |  4   |     1     |  1 |   3  | 5}         |\r\n  |Darjeeling            |  4    |  3   |     5     |  3 |   3  | 6}         |\r\n  |Hazareebaugh          |  6    |  1   |     1     |  4 |   2  | 4}         |\r\n  |Kangra                |  4    |  3   |     1     |  3 |   3  | 9} Land    |\r\n  |Dehra Dhoon           |  5    |  3   |     1     |  3 |   3  | 7} carriage|\r\n  |Kumaon                |  5    |  3   |     4     |  2 |   3  | 8}         |\r\n  |Neilgherries          |  4    |  3   |     2     |  2 |   3  | 4}         |\r\n  |Western Dooars        |  1    |  3   |     1     |  1 |   4  | 1}         |\r\n  +----------------------+-------+------+-----------+----+------+------------+\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Note to Third Edition.--I give them, as far as I know, in the\r\norder they became Tea districts. Though in the said order there is,\r\nI believe, no great error, I may be open to correction in one or two\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\n[8] These are virtually one, and I shall allude to both as Cachar.\r\n\r\n[9] When this was written the demand for Green Teas in Europe was\r\ngreater than it is now. Still Kumaon has found a local market for Green\r\nTea over the border, that is, among the Asiatic tribes, and Darjeeling\r\nmight do the same.\r\n\r\n[10] Is it possible that the continued deception (it was nothing less)\r\nwas owing to the fact that Government had gardens to sell there? They\r\nwere advertised for sale a long time at absurd prices.\r\n\r\n[11] The rainfall given for the Western Dooars cannot be relied on.\r\nPerhaps more than the average fell in 1869, but anyhow, I should think\r\n83 inches registered for August is an error. I know the yearly fall\r\nthere is _not_ 252 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo pronounce as precisely on soil as to climate is not easy. The Tea\r\nplant will grow on almost any soil, and will flourish on many. Still\r\nthere are broad general rules to be laid down in the selection of soils\r\nfor Tea, which no one can ignore with impunity.\r\n\r\nWhen first I turned my attention to Tea, I collected soils from many\r\ngardens, noting in each case how the plants flourished. I then sat\r\ndown to examine them, never doubting to arrive at some broad practical\r\nconclusions. I was sadly disappointed. I found the most opposing soils\r\nnourished, apparently, equally good plants. I knew not then much about\r\nTea, and judged of the Tea bushes mostly by the size (a very fallacious\r\ntest); still, after-experience has convinced me I was more or less\r\nright in the conclusion I then came to, that several soils are good for\r\nTea.\r\n\r\nNothing, then, but broad general rules can be laid down on this point,\r\nfor I defy anyone to select any one soil as the best for Tea, to the\r\nexclusion of others.\r\n\r\nA light sandy loam is perhaps as good a soil as any _out_ of the\r\nHimalayas. It ought to be deep, and the more decayed vegetable matter\r\nthere is lying on its surface the better. If deep enough for the\r\ndescent of the tap-root, say 3 feet, it matters not much what the\r\nsubsoil is, otherwise a yellowish red subsoil is an advantage. This\r\nsubsoil is generally a mixture of clay and sand. Much of Assam, Cachar,\r\nand Chittagong is as the above, but, as a rule, it is richest in Assam,\r\npoorest in Chittagong.\r\n\r\nWhere the loam is of a greasy nature (very different to clay), with a\r\nmixture of sand in it, it is superior to the above, for it has more\r\nbody. All good Tea soils must have a fair proportion of sand, and if\r\nnot otherwise apparent, it may be detected by mixing a little of the\r\nsoil with spittle and rubbing it on the hand. If the hand be then held\r\nup towards the sun, the particles of sand will be seen to glisten.\r\n\r\nThe soil so common in Kumaon, that is, light rich loam with any amount\r\nof decayed vegetable matter on it, and with a ferruginous reddish\r\nyellowish subsoil, is, I consider, the finest soil in the world for\r\nTea. The rich decayed vegetable matter is the produce for centuries of\r\noak leaves in the Himalayan forests, and, as all the world knows, oak\r\nonly grows in temperate climes.\r\n\r\nIt was long believed that Tea would thrive best on poor soil. The idea\r\nwas due to the description of Tea soils in China to be found in the\r\nfirst books that treated of Tea. But the fact that Tea, as a rule, is\r\nonly grown in China on soil which is useless for anything else quite\r\nalters the case. If a soil is light and friable enough, it cannot be\r\ntoo rich for Tea.\r\n\r\nBall’s book “On the Cultivation and Manufacture of Tea in China” has\r\nmuch on Tea soils, but the opinions the author collected are sadly at\r\nvariance, and on the whole teach nothing.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I will attempt to point out the qualities in soils in\r\nwhich the Tea plant delights, as also the qualities it abhors.\r\n\r\nIt loves soils friable, that is, easily divided into all their atoms.\r\nThis argues a fair proportion of sand, but this should not be in\r\nexcess, or the soil will be poor. The soil should be porous--imbibing\r\nand parting with water freely. The more decayed vegetable matter on its\r\nsurface the better.\r\n\r\nTo be avoided are stiff soils of every kind, as also those which\r\nwhen they dry, after rain, cake together and split. Avoid also\r\nblack-coloured, or even dark-coloured earths. All soils good for the\r\nTea plant are light coloured. If, however, the dark colour arises\r\nfrom decayed vegetation, that is not the colour of the soil, and, as\r\nobserved, vegetable matter is a great advantage. Judge of colour when\r\nsoil is dry--for even light-coloured soil looks dark when wet. Soil\r\nwhich will make bricks will not grow Tea; and though I have sometimes\r\nseen young plants thrive on stiff soil, I do not believe in any stiff\r\nsoil as a permanence.\r\n\r\nStones, if not in excess, are advantageous in all soils inclined to\r\nbe stiff, for they help to keep them open. But then they must not be\r\nlarge, as if so they act as badly as a rocky substratum preventing the\r\ndescent of the tap-root.\r\n\r\nThe reason, I take it, why Tea thrives best in light soils is that the\r\nspongioles or ends of the feeding roots are very tender, and do not\r\neasily penetrate any other.\r\n\r\nThere is more nourishment in stiffer soils, but for this reason the Tea\r\nplant cannot take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nIf a chosen soil be too stiff, it may be much improved for Tea by\r\nmixing sand with it. However, even where sand is procurable near, the\r\nexpense of this is great. When done, the sand should be mixed with the\r\nsoil taken out of the holes in which the plants are to be placed (see\r\nTransplanting), and it may be done again later by placing sand round\r\nthe plants and digging it in. All this though is extra labour and very\r\nexpensive, so none but a good Tea soil should ever be selected, and\r\nit is very easily found, for it exists in parts of all the districts\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nNATURE OF JUNGLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have not much to say under this head. I have heard many opinions\r\nas to the kind of trees and jungle that should exist in contemplated\r\nclearances, but I attach little or no weight to them, at all events in\r\nBengal.\r\n\r\nIn the Himalayas it is somewhat different. There oak trees should be\r\nsought for; their existence invariably makes rich soil.[12] Fir, on the\r\ncontrary, indicates poor soil. At elevations, however, the desideratum\r\nof a warm aspect interferes, for the best oak forests are on the colder\r\nside. I speak of course of elevations practicable, say three or four\r\nthousand feet; above this it is a waste of money to try and cultivate\r\nTea.\r\n\r\nIn Bengal I do not think the nature of the jungle on land contemplated\r\nsignifies much. As a rule, the thicker the jungle the richer the\r\nsoil; but in seeking for a site large trees should not be a _sine quâ\r\nnon_. Much of the coarse grass land is very good, and large trees add\r\nenormously to the expense of clearings.[13] It is not cutting them down\r\nwhich is so expensive, it is cutting them up and getting rid of them by\r\nburning, or otherwise, after the former is done.\r\n\r\nI have discussed soil fully already, and need only add here that if the\r\nknowledge to do so exists, it is better to judge of soil from the soil\r\nitself than from the vegetation on it, though doubtless a fact that\r\nluxuriant vegetation indicates rich soil.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] The oak tree leaves cause a rich deposit of vegetable matter.\r\n\r\n[13] The Western Dooars are in many parts covered with this coarse\r\ngrass, and nowhere is there better soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nWATER AND SANITATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese may be discussed together and shortly.\r\n\r\nOf course adjacent water-carriage is a great advantage for a garden,\r\nand it should be obtained, if possible, in selecting a site. The\r\nexpense of land-carriage, where there is no rail, is great, and Tea\r\ncultivation requires all advantages to make it pay well.\r\n\r\nBut it is water for a garden that particularly concerns us now. It\r\nis not easy to find land that can be irrigated (this is discussed\r\nelsewhere), but no labour or expense in getting such land would be\r\nthrown away. Irrigation, combined with high cultivation in other\r\nrespects, will give a yield per acre undreamt of.\r\n\r\nIn no case should a plantation be made except where a running stream\r\nis handy. Water is a necessity for seedlings, and a plentiful adjacent\r\nsupply of it is a great desideratum for the comfort and health of every\r\nsoul on the garden. We all know how dependent the natives are on water,\r\nand it is evident facilities in this respect will conduce much (whether\r\nthe labour be local or imported) both to get and keep coolies. Norton’s\r\ntube wells--a cheap and most efficient mode of procuring water--will,\r\nI doubt not, be eventually much used on Tea plantations.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that, as a rule, a good Tea climate is not a\r\nhealthy one. There is no getting over the fact, and we can only make\r\nthe best of it. The house, the factories, and all the buildings should\r\nbe placed as high as possible, and not very close to each other, both\r\nfor the sake of health and in the event of fire. The locality should\r\nbe well drained, and cleanliness be attained in every possible way.\r\nGive the coolies good houses, with raised mechans to sleep on, and\r\nsprinkle occasionally carbolic acid powder in your own house and those\r\nof others.\r\n\r\nSanitation is, however, a large subject. It can be studied elsewhere.\r\nGeneral ideas on it, and on the properties of the commonest medicines,\r\nare a great advantage to any intending Tea planter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nLAY OF LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first idea prevailing about Tea was that it should be planted on\r\nslopes. It was thought, and truly, that the plant was impatient of\r\nstagnant water, and so it is, but it is not necessary to plant it\r\non slopes in consequence. Pictures of Chinese, suspended by chains\r\n(inasmuch as the locality could not be otherwise reached), picking\r\nTea off bushes growing in the crevices of rocks, somewhat helped this\r\nnotion; and when stated, as it was, that the Tea produced in such\r\nplaces was the finest, and commanded the highest price--which was\r\nnot true--intending planters in India went crazy in their search for\r\nimpracticable steeps! Much of the failure in Tea has arisen from this\r\nfact, for a great part of many, the whole of some, gardens have been\r\nplanted on land so steep that the Tea can never last or thrive on it.\r\nThis is especially the case in parts of the Darjeeling district.\r\n\r\nSloping land is objectionable in the following respects. It cannot\r\nbe highly cultivated in any way (I hold Tea will only pay with high\r\ncultivation), for high cultivation consists in frequent digging, to\r\nkeep the soil open and get rid of weeds, and liberal manuring. If\r\nsuch soil is dug in the rainy season, it is washed down to the foot\r\nof the hill, and if manure is applied at any time of the year, it\r\nexperiences the same fate when the rain comes. As it cannot be dug,\r\nweeds necessarily thrive and diminish the yield by choking the plants.\r\n\r\nThe choice is therefore of two evils: “low cultivation and weeds,”\r\nor “high cultivation which bares the roots of the plants in a\r\ntwelvemonth.” Of the two, the first _must_ be chosen, for if the latter\r\nwere pursued, the plants, getting gradually more and more denuded of\r\nsoil, would simply topple over in two or three years. But choosing the\r\nlesser evil, the mischief is not confined to the bad effects of low\r\ncultivation. Dig the land as little as you will, the great force of the\r\nrains washes down a good deal of soil. The plants do not sink as the\r\nsoil lowers, and the consequence is that all Tea plants on slopes have\r\nthe lower side bare of earth and the roots exposed. This is more and\r\nmore the case the steeper the slope. These exposed roots shrivel up as\r\nthe sun acts on them, the plant languishes and yields very little leaf.\r\n\r\nAttempts are made to remedy the mischief by carrying earth up from\r\nbelow yearly, and placing it under the plant; but the expense of doing\r\nthis is great, and the palliation is only temporary, for the same thing\r\noccurs again and again as each rainy season returns.\r\n\r\nThe mischief is greater on stiff than on sandy soils, for on the former\r\nthe earth is detached in great pieces and carried down the hill. I know\r\none garden in Chittagong, a large one, where the evil is so great, that\r\nthe sooner the cultivation is abandoned the better for the owners.\r\n\r\nA great many gardens in India, indeed the majority, are on slopes; a\r\nfew in Assam, the greater number in Cachar, some in Chittagong, and\r\nalmost all the Himalayan plantations. Such of these as are on _steep_\r\nslopes will, I believe, never pay, and instead of improving yearly (as\r\ngood gardens, highly cultivated, should do even after they have arrived\r\nat full bearing) such, I fear, will deteriorate year by year.\r\n\r\nPlantations on moderate slopes need not fail because of the slopes. The\r\nevils slight slopes entail are not great, but the sooner the fact is\r\naccepted that sloping cannot vie against flat land for the cultivation\r\nof Tea the better.\r\n\r\nWhere only the lower parts of slopes are planted, the plants do very\r\nwell. The upper part being jungle the wash is not great, and the plants\r\nbenefit much by the rich vegetable matter the rain brings down from\r\nabove. I have often seen very fine plants on the lower part of slopes,\r\nwhere the upper has been left in jungle, and I should not hesitate to\r\nplant such portions _if_ the slope was moderate.\r\n\r\nWhere teelah land, in Eastern Bengal, or sloping land in the Himalayas,\r\nChittagong, or elsewhere, has to be adopted, aspect is all-important.\r\nA good aspect in one climate is bad in another. In Assam, Cachar,\r\nChittagong, and all warm places, choose the coolest; at high elevations\r\n(temperate climes), the warmest.\r\n\r\nIn the Himalayas, moreover, the warmer aspects are, as a rule, the\r\nmost fertile; _vice versâ_ in warm localities. Many a garden, which\r\nwould have done very well on the moderate slopes chosen had _only_ the\r\nproper aspects been planted, has been ruined by planting all sides of\r\nteelahs or hills indiscriminately. The southern and western slopes\r\nof plantations in warm sites are generally very bare of plants. Not\r\nstrange they should be so, when the power of the reflected rays of the\r\nafternoon sun is considered. Again, in cold climates plants cannot\r\nthrive on northern aspects, for their great want in such climes is heat\r\nand sunshine. Let the above fault, then, be avoided in both cases, for\r\nthough doubtless a garden is more handy, and looks better in one piece\r\nplanted all over without any intervening jungle, even patches of jungle\r\nlook better, and are decidedly cheaper, than bare cultivated hills.\r\n\r\nOf flat land, after what I have written, I need not add much. It is\r\nof two kinds, table and valley land; the former is very rare in Tea\r\ndistricts, at least of any extent, which makes it worth while to plant\r\nit. There are two gardens in Chittagong on such flat table land, and\r\nthey are both doing very well. Table land cannot be too flat, for the\r\nnatural drainage is so great no stagnant water can lie.[14]\r\n\r\nValley land is not good if it is _perfectly_ flat. It will then be\r\nsubject to inundation and stagnant water. There is nothing that kills\r\nthe plant so surely and quickly as the latter. Even quite flat valleys\r\ncan be made sweet by artificial drainage, but to do this a lower level,\r\nnot too far distant, must exist, and the danger is not quite removed\r\nthen. Valleys in which no water-course exists, and which slope towards\r\nthe mouth _alone_, are to be avoided, for the plants near the mouth\r\nalways get choked with sand. The best valleys are those with a gentle\r\nslope both ways, one towards the lowest line of the valley, be it a\r\nrunning water-course, or a dry nullah which carries off rain, the other\r\ntowards the mouth of the valley. Such valleys drain themselves, or at\r\nleast very little artificial drainage is necessary. A valley of this\r\nkind, with a running stream through it, is _most_ valuable for Tea, and\r\nif the other advantages of soil and climate are present it is simply a\r\nperfect site. Such however are not frequent. If in such valleys, as is\r\ngenerally the case, the slope from the head to the mouth is enough, the\r\nrunning stream can be “bunded” (shut up) at a high level, and brought\r\nalong one side at a sufficient elevation to irrigate the whole.\r\n\r\nI have never seen but one garden in a valley that fulfils all these\r\nconditions exactly. It is in Chittagong; the soil is good, labour\r\nplentiful, and manure abundant. It ought to do great things, for the\r\npossibility of irrigating plants in the dry season (which, as observed,\r\nis very trying in Chittagong) will give several extra flushes in the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nOf course in the wet season on such land the water must be allowed to\r\nresume its natural course.\r\n\r\nNarrow valleys are not worth planting. No narrow tracts of land, with\r\njungle on both sides, are worth the expense of cultivation, for the\r\ncontinual encroachment of the jungle gives much extra work. The plants,\r\nmoreover, in very narrow valleys get half-buried with soil washed down\r\nfrom the adjacent slopes. Narrow valleys are therefore, in any case,\r\nbetter avoided.\r\n\r\nTo conclude shortly, flat lands can be highly cultivated, steep\r\nslopes cannot. Tea pays best (perhaps not at all otherwise) with high\r\ncultivation--_ergo_, flat lands are preferable.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[14] I am now commencing a second garden in the Western Dooars on flat\r\ntable land, and the site is an exceptionally favourable one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nLAYING OUT A GARDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this I mean, so dividing it when first made into parts, that\r\nlater the said parts shall be easily recognised, and separately or\r\ndifferently treated, as they may require it.\r\n\r\nThe usual custom is to begin at one end of a plantation, and dig it\r\nright through to the other. In the same way with the pruning and\r\nplucking, and I believe the system is a very bad one. Different\r\nportions of gardens require different treatment, inasmuch as they\r\ndiffer in soil, and otherwise. One part of a plantation is much more\r\nprolific of weeds than another--how absurd that it should be cleaned no\r\noftener! This is only one exemplification of difference of treatment,\r\nbut in many ways it is necessary, most of all in plucking leaf.\r\n\r\nAll parts of a plantation, owing in some places to the different ages\r\nof the plants, in others to the variety in the soil and its productive\r\npowers, in others to slopes or to aspect, do not yield leaf equally,\r\nthat is, flush does not follow flush with equal rapidity. In some\r\nplaces (supposing each part to be picked when the flush is ready) seven\r\ndays’ interval will exist between the flushes, in others nine, ten, or\r\ntwelve; but no attention, as a rule, is paid to this. The pickers have\r\nfinished the garden at the west end, the east end is again ready, and\r\nwhen done, the middle part will be taken in hand, be it ready or be it\r\nnot! It may be that the middle part flushes quicker than any other; in\r\nthis case the flush will be more than mature when it is taken, in fact\r\nit will have begun to harden; or it may be the middle part does _not_\r\nflush as quickly as the others; in this case it will be picked before\r\nit is ready, that is, when the flush is too young, and the yield will\r\nconsequently be smaller.\r\n\r\nI believe the yield of a plantation may be largely increased by\r\nattending to this. Every Tea estate should be divided into gardens of,\r\nsay, about five to ten acres each.[15] If no natural division exists,\r\nsmall roads to act as such should be made. More than this cannot be\r\ndone when the plantation is first laid out, but when later the plants\r\nyield, any difference between the productive powers of different\r\nparts of the same garden should be noted, and these divided off into\r\nsections. To do this latter with roads would take up too much space,\r\nand small masonry pillars, whitewashed, are the best. Four of these,\r\none at each corner of a section, are enough, and they need not be\r\nmore than 3 feet high and 1 foot square. Thus each garden may, where\r\nnecessary, be divided into two sections, which, in a 300-acre estate,\r\npartitioned off into thirty gardens, would give about forty to sixty\r\nsections. No matter where a section may be, directly the flush on it\r\nis ready it should be picked. Where the soil on any one garden is much\r\nthe same, and observation shows the plants all over it flush equally,\r\nit may be left all in one. I only lay down the principle, and I am\r\nvery certain it works well, the proof of which is that, where I have\r\npractised it, some sections during the season give three, four, and\r\nfive flushes more than others. Had the usual plan of picking from one\r\nend to the other been adopted, they would have been all _forced_ to\r\ngive the same number; in other words, the said extra flushes would have\r\nbeen lost, and further loss occasioned by some flushes being taken\r\nbefore they were ready, others after a portion of the tender leaf had\r\nhardened.\r\n\r\nThe best plan is simply to number the gardens from 1 upwards, and the\r\nsections in each garden the same way. Thus supposing No. 5 garden is\r\ndivided into three sections, they will be known respectively as 5-1,\r\n5-2, and 5-3. This is the best way for the natives, and I find they\r\nsoon learn to designate each section. I have a man whose special duty\r\n(though he has other work also) it is to see each day which sections\r\nare ready to pick the following, and those, and those alone, are\r\npicked. Practice soon teaches the number of pickers required for any\r\ngiven number of sections, and that number only are put to the work.\r\nIf a portion is not completed that day, it is the first taken in hand\r\nthe next, and if any day on no sections is the flush ready, no leaf is\r\npicked the following.\r\n\r\nApart from leaf-picking, the garden and section plan detailed is useful\r\nin many ways. Each garden, if not each section which most requires\r\nit, is dug, pruned, or manured at the best time, and any spot on the\r\nplantation is easily designated. The plan facilitates the measurement\r\nof work, and enables correct lists of the flushes gathered to be kept.\r\nIt is thus seen which gardens yield best, and the worst can, by extra\r\nmanuring, be brought to equal those.\r\n\r\nIn short, the advantages are many, too numerous to detail.\r\n\r\nOf course all this can be better done on a flat garden than on one\r\nplanted on slopes, and though it may not be possible to work it out\r\nas much in detail on the latter, still a good deal in that way can be\r\ndone, and I strongly recommend it.\r\n\r\nIn laying out a plantation keep it all as much together as possible,\r\nthe more it is in one block the easier it is supervised, the cheaper\r\nit is worked. Still do not, with a view to this, take in any bad land,\r\nfor bad land will never pay.\r\n\r\nLet your lines of Tea plants, as far as practicable, run with\r\ngeometrical regularity. You will later find, both in measuring work\r\nand picking leaf, great advantages therefrom. In gardens where the\r\nlines are not regular portions are continually being passed over in\r\nleaf-picking, and thereby not only is the present flush from such parts\r\nlost, but the following is also retarded.\r\n\r\nIf your different gardens are so situated that the roads through them,\r\nthat is from one garden to the other, can be along _the side_ of any\r\ngarden without increasing the length of the road, by all means adopt\r\nthat route. There is no such good boundary for a garden as a road that\r\nis being continually traversed. It will save many rupees by preventing\r\nthe encroachment of jungle into a garden, and more space is thus also\r\ngiven for plants. It is, however, of no use to do it if a road through\r\nthe middle of a garden is shorter, as coolies _will_ always take the\r\nshortest route.\r\n\r\nThe lines of plants on sloping ground should neither run up and down,\r\nnor directly across the slope. If they run up and down, gutters or\r\nwater-courses will form between the lines, and much additional earth\r\nwill be washed away thereby. If they run right across the hill the same\r\nthing will occur _between the trees in each line_, and the lower side\r\nof each plant will have its roots laid very bare. It is on all slopes\r\na choice of evils, but if the lines are laid diagonally across the\r\nhill, so that the slope _along the lines_ shall be a moderate one, the\r\nevil is reduced as far as it can be by any arrangement of the plants.\r\nNo, I forgot; there is one other thing. The closer the lines to each\r\nother, and the closer the plants in the lines to each other, in short,\r\nthe more thickly the ground on slopes is planted the less will be the\r\nwash, for stems and roots retain the soil in its place, and the more\r\nthere are the greater the advantage.\r\n\r\nWhere slopes are steep (though, remember, steep slopes are to be\r\navoided) terracing may be resorted to with advantage, as the washing\r\ndown of the soil is much checked by it.\r\n\r\nOn flat land, of course, it does not really signify in which directions\r\nthe lines run, but such a garden looks best if, when the roads are\r\nstraight, the lines run at right angles to them.\r\n\r\nIn laying out a garden, choose a central spot with water handy for\r\nyour factory, bungalow, and all your buildings; let your Tea-houses\r\nbe as close to your dwelling-house as possible, so that during the\r\nmanufacturing time you can be in and out at all hours of the day\r\nand night. Much of your success will depend upon this. Let all your\r\nbuildings be as near to each other as they can, but still far enough\r\napart, that any one building may burn without endangering others. You\r\nneed not construct any Tea-buildings until the third year.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[15] A garden I have just finished in the Western Dooars is 300 acres\r\nin extent, all on flat land without any breaks in the cultivation, and\r\nall divided into sections of 5 acres each. Being in one large block it\r\nis not divided into gardens at all, only sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nVARIETIES OF THE TEA PLANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are many, but they all arise from two species: the China\r\nplant, the common Tea-bush in China; and the indigenous plant, first\r\ndiscovered some forty years ago in Assam.\r\n\r\nThese are quite different species of the same plant. Whether the\r\ndifference was produced by climate, by soil, or in what way, no one\r\nknows, and here we have only to do with the facts that they _do_ differ\r\nin every respect. A purely indigenous plant or tree (for in its wild\r\nstate it may more properly be called the latter) grows with one stem\r\nor trunk, and runs up to 15 and 18 feet high. It is always found in\r\nthick jungle, and would thus appear to like shade. I believe it does\r\nwhen young; but I am quite sure, if the jungle were cleared round an\r\nindigenous Tea-tree found in the forest, it would thrive better from\r\nthat day. The China bush (for it is never more) after the second year\r\nhas numerous stems, and 6 or 7 feet would seem to be its limit in\r\nheight. The lowest branches of a China plant are close to the ground,\r\nbut in a pure cultivated indigenous, from 9 inches to 1 foot above the\r\nsoil the single stem is clean.\r\n\r\nThe indigenous grows quicker after the second or third year than the\r\nChina, if it has not been over-pruned or over-plucked when young. In\r\nother words, it flushes quicker, for flushing is growing.\r\n\r\nThe indigenous does not run so much to wood as the China. Indigenous\r\nseedlings require to be watered oftener than China, for the latter do\r\nnot suffer as quickly from drought. The indigenous tree has a leaf\r\nof 9 inches long and more. The leaf of the China bush never exceeds 4\r\ninches. The indigenous leaf is a bright pale green, the China leaf a\r\ndull dark green colour. The indigenous “flushes,” that is, produces new\r\ntender leaf, much more copiously than the China, and this in two ways:\r\n_first_, the leaves are larger, and thus if only even in number exceed\r\nin bulk what the China has given; and _secondly_, it flushes oftener.\r\nThe infusion of Tea made from the indigenous species is far more\r\n“rasping” and “pungent” than what the China plant can give, and the\r\nTea commands a much higher price. The young leaves, from which alone\r\nTea is made, are of a much finer and softer texture in the indigenous\r\nthan in the China; the former may be compared to satin, the latter to\r\nleather. The young leaves of the indigenous, moreover, do not harden so\r\nquickly as those of the China; thus, if there is any unavoidable delay\r\nin picking a flush, the loss is less with the former. In the fact that\r\nunpruned or unpicked plants (for picking is a miniature pruning) give\r\nfewer and less succulent young leaves which harden quicker than pruned\r\nones, the two varieties would seem to be alike. The China variety is\r\nmuch more prolific of seed than the indigenous; the former also gives\r\nit when younger, and as seed checks leaf, the China is inferior in this\r\nas in other respects. The China is by far the hardier plant; it is much\r\neasier to rear, and it will grow in widely differing climates, which\r\nthe indigenous will not.\r\n\r\nA patch of indigenous with a mature flush on it is a pretty sight. The\r\nplants all appear as if crowned with gold (they are truly so if other\r\nadvantages exist), and are a great contrast to the China variety if it\r\ncan also be seen near.\r\n\r\nI have now, I think, pointed out the leading characteristics of the\r\ntwo original varieties of the Tea plant, and it stands to reason no\r\none would grow the China who could get indigenous. But the truth is,\r\na pure specimen of either is rare. The plants between indigenous and\r\nChina are called “hybrids.” They were in the first instance produced by\r\nthe inoculation, when close together, of the pollen of one kind into\r\nthe flower of the other, and the result was a true hybrid, partaking\r\nequally of the indigenous and China characteristics; but the process\r\nwas repeated again and again between the said hybrid and an indigenous\r\nor China, and again later between hybrids of different degrees, so\r\nthat now there are very many varieties of the Tea plant--100 or even\r\nmore--and no garden is wholly indigenous or wholly China. So close do\r\nthe varieties run, no one can draw the line and say where the China\r\nbecomes a hybrid, the hybrid an indigenous. Though as a rule the young\r\nleaves are light green or dark green, as the plant approaches the\r\nindigenous or China in its character, there are a certain class of\r\nbushes all hybrid, whose young leaves have strong shades of crimson and\r\npurple. Some even are quite red, others quite purple. These colours do\r\nnot last as the leaf hardens, and the matured leaves of these plants do\r\nnot differ from others. Plants with these coloured leaves are prolific.\r\n\r\nThe nearer each plant approaches the indigenous, the higher its class\r\nand excellence, _ergo_ one plantation is composed of a much better\r\nclass of plants than another. Had China seed never been introduced into\r\nIndia, a very different state of things would have existed now. The\r\ncultivation would not have been so large, but far more valuable. The\r\npropagation and rearing of the indigenous, as observed, is difficult;\r\nthe China is much hardier while young. So difficult is it to rear\r\nsuccessively the _pure_ indigenous, perhaps the best plan, were it\r\nall to come over again, would be to propagate a high-class hybrid and\r\ndistribute it, never allowing any China seed or plants to leave the\r\nnursery, which should have been a Government one. But we must take\r\nthings as they are. The Government nurseries in the Himalayas and the\r\nDehra Dhoon (there have never been any elsewhere, and worse sites could\r\nnot have been chosen) were planted entirely with China seeds, the\r\nseedlings distributed all over the country, and thus the mischief was\r\ndone. The Indian Tea is vastly superior to the Chinese, and commands\r\na much higher price at home, but it is still very inferior to what it\r\nwould have been, had not Chinese seed been so recklessly imported and\r\ndistributed over the country.\r\n\r\nThe home of the indigenous Tea tree is in the deep luxurious jungles\r\nof Assam and Cachar.[16] There it grows into a good-sized tree. I have\r\nseen it 20 feet high. These are of no use, except for seed, until\r\nthey are cut down. When this is done, they throw out many new shoots,\r\ncovered with young tender leaves, fit for Tea. They are, of course,\r\nfar too big to transplant, but on some sites where they were numerous,\r\nthat spot was chosen for the plantation, and some of these are the best\r\ngardens in Assam and Cachar.\r\n\r\nThe indigenous plant and high-class hybrid require a hot moist climate,\r\nand will not therefore flourish in any parts of India outside Eastern\r\nBengal. I have tried them in the Himalayas, there the cold kills them.\r\nIn Dehra Dhoon and Kangra the climate is far too dry; besides, the hot\r\nwinds in the former, and the cold in the latter, are prejudicial. The\r\nTerai under Darjeeling suits them. In Assam, Cachar, and Chittagong,\r\nthe indigenous and the highest class hybrids will thrive, for the\r\nclimate of all three is suitable, but perhaps Northern Assam possesses\r\nthe best climate of all for such plants.\r\n\r\nThe Himalayan gardens consist entirely of Chinese plants mixed\r\noccasionally with a low class of hybrid. They were all formed from the\r\nGovernment Nurseries where nothing but Chinese was reared. Occasional\r\nimportations of Assam and Cachar seed will account for the sprinkling\r\nof low class hybrids which may be found. The same may be said of Dehra\r\nDhoon and Kangra. In some gardens in the Terai below Darjeeling a high\r\nclass of plant exists. In Assam, Cachar, and Chittagong the plantations\r\nvary much, but all have some indigenous and high class hybrids, while\r\nmany gardens are composed of nothing else.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, then, that the value of a garden depends much on the\r\nclass of its plants, and that a wise man will only propagate the best.\r\nOnly the seed from good varieties should be selected, and gradually\r\nall inferior bushes should be rooted out and a good kind substituted.\r\nWhen this shall have been systematically done for a few years on a good\r\ngarden, which has other advantages, the yield per acre will far exceed\r\nanything yet realised or even thought of.\r\n\r\nGovernment action in the matter of Tea has been prejudicial in many\r\nways, but in none more so than when they were doing their best to\r\nfoster the cultivation by distributing Chinese seed and seedlings\r\ngratis. No one can blame here (would the Government were equally free\r\nfrom blame in all Tea matters!), but the mischief is none the less. It\r\nwill never be possible to undo the harm then done.\r\n\r\nThe seed of indigenous, hybrid, and Chinese is like in appearance,\r\nand cannot be distinguished. Thus, when seed formerly was got from a\r\ndistance, the purchaser was at the mercy of the vendor.\r\n\r\nHigh cultivation improves the class of a Tea plant. Thus, a purely\r\nChina bush, if highly cultivated and well manured, will in two or\r\nthree years assume a hybrid character. High cultivation will therefore\r\nimprove the class of _all_ the plants in a garden; but the cheapest\r\nand best plan with low class Chinese plants is to root them out and\r\nreplace them with others, as will be explained hereafter. Low class\r\nseedlings should also be rooted out of nurseries.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude this chapter better than by giving an extract from\r\nthe “Government Records” alluded to in a previous chapter, and I add a\r\nfew remarks at foot, as otherwise the reader might be puzzled with some\r\nopinions expressed which are so much at variance with the generally\r\nreceived opinions on Tea to-day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Several varieties.]\r\n\r\n  _Kinds of Tea Plants cultivated._--“When Government resolved on\r\n  trying the experiment of cultivating Tea in India, they deputed Dr.\r\n  Gordon to China to acquire information respecting the cultivation\r\n  and manufacture of Teas, and to procure Tea seeds. Aided by Dr.\r\n  Gutzlaff he procured a quantity of seeds from the mountains in the\r\n  Amoy districts. These seeds were sent to the Calcutta Botanical\r\n  Garden, where they were sown in boxes. On germinating they were sent\r\n  up the country in boats, some to Assam and some to Gurhmuktesur,\r\n  and from thence to Kumaon and Gurhwal. From these plants date the\r\n  commencement of the Tea plantations in the Himalayas.[17] Tea was\r\n  first made in Kumaon in 1841, and the samples sent to England, and\r\n  were pronounced to be of good quality, fitted for the home markets,\r\n  and similar to the Oolong Souchong varieties. Thus Messrs. Thompson,\r\n  of Mincing Lane, report on a sample sent by us to Dr. Royle in 1842:\r\n  ‘The samples of Tea received belong to the Oolong Souchong kind,\r\n  fine-flavoured and strong. This is equal to the superior black Tea\r\n  generally sent as presents, and better for the most part than the\r\n  Chinese Tea imported for mercantile purposes.’[18] By many it was\r\n  supposed that there were different species of the Tea plant, and that\r\n  the species cultivated in the south districts of China was different\r\n  from that met with in the north. To solve this mystery, and at the\r\n  same time procure the best varieties of the Tea plant, Mr. Fortune\r\n  was deputed to China. By him large numbers of Tea plants were sent\r\n  from different districts of China celebrated for their Teas, and\r\n  are now thriving luxuriantly in all the plantations throughout the\r\n  Kohistan of the North-west Provinces and Punjab. Both green and\r\n  black Tea plants were sent, the former from Whey Chow, Mooyeen,\r\n  Chusan, Silver Island, and Tein Tang, near Ningpo, and the latter\r\n  from Woo-e San, Tein San, and Tsin Gan, in the Woo-e district. But\r\n  so similar are the green and black Tea plants to each other, and the\r\n  plants from the Amoy districts, that the most practised eye, when\r\n  they are mixed together, cannot separate them, showing that they\r\n  are nothing more than mere varieties of one and the same plant, the\r\n  changes in the form of the leaf being brought about by cultivation.\r\n  Moreover, throughout the plantation fifty varieties might easily\r\n  be pointed out; but they run so into each other as to render it\r\n  impossible to assign them any trivial character, and the produce of\r\n  the seed of different varieties does not produce the same varieties\r\n  only, but several varieties, proving that the changes are entirely\r\n  owing to cultivation; nor do the plants, cultivated at 6,000 feet\r\n  in the Himalayas, differ in the least in their varieties from those\r\n  cultivated at 2,500 feet of altitude in the Dehra Dhoon.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Assam species.]\r\n\r\n  “That the Assam plant is a marked species is true, it being\r\n  distinguished by its large membranous and lanceolate leaf, small\r\n  flower, and upright growth.\r\n\r\n  “It is a very inferior plant for making Tea, and its leaves are\r\n  therefore not used.[19] Though the plants received from the different\r\n  districts of China do not differ from those first sent to the\r\n  plantations, it is highly important to know that the Tea plants\r\n  from well-known green and black Tea districts of China now exist in\r\n  the plantations, as it is stated that local causes exert a great\r\n  influence in the quality of the Teas as much as the manufacture\r\n  does. The expense, therefore, incurred in stocking the Government\r\n  plantations with the finest kinds and varieties of Tea plants\r\n  procurable in China, though great, will be amply repaid. From them\r\n  superior kinds of Tea are produced.”\r\n\r\nThe above extract is a sample of the said “Records.” They abound in\r\nerrors and highly coloured statements, which induced many to embark\r\nin Tea on unfavourable sites, and “the red book” (it is bound in a\r\nred cover) is not exactly blessed by the majority of the Himalayan\r\nplanters!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] It is a singular fact that none exists in Northern Cachar, that\r\nis, on the northern side of the river.\r\n\r\n[17] And also the introduction of a bad class of plants.--E. M.\r\n\r\n[18] A single small sample of Tea very carefully made, and with an\r\namount of labour which could never be bestowed on the mass, is little\r\nor no criterion. Tea is better made in Kumaon in 1878 than it was in\r\n1842, but Kumaon Tea does not vie in price with Eastern Bengal produce.\r\nAll the Himalayan Tea is weak, though of a delicate flavour; all Tea\r\ngrown at high elevation _must_ be so.--E. M.\r\n\r\n[19] A little enquiry would have shown this was not true, even when it\r\nwas written. All Tea planters, brokers, and all interested in Tea, know\r\nnow (many knew it then) that the “Assam species,” viz., the indigenous,\r\nmakes the most valuable Tea produced.--E. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTEA SEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough there is a great difference in Tea plants (see last chapter) the\r\nseed of all is the same, and it is therefore impossible to say from\r\nwhat class of plants it has been gathered.\r\n\r\nWhen Tea seed was very valuable (it has sold in the Tea-fever days as\r\nhigh as Rs. 200 and Rs. 300 per maund) it was the object of planters to\r\ngrow as much as possible.\r\n\r\nHigh class plants do not give much seed, a plantation therefore with\r\nmuch on it should be avoided in purchasing seed.\r\n\r\nThe Tea flower (the germ of next year’s seed) appears in the autumn,\r\nand the seed is ripe at the end of the following October or early\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nIt takes thus one year to form.\r\n\r\nSeed is ripe when the capsule becomes brown, and when breaking the\r\nlatter the inner brown covering of the seed adheres to the seed and\r\n_not_ to the capsule.\r\n\r\nOne capsule contains 1, 2, 3, and sometimes even 4 seeds.\r\n\r\nThough the mass ripens at the end of October, some ripen earlier; the\r\ncapsule splits and the seed falls on the ground. If, therefore, all\r\nthe seed from a garden is required, it is well to send round boys all\r\nOctober to pick up such seeds.\r\n\r\nWhen the seed is picked at the end of October or early November the\r\nmass is still in capsules. It should be laid in the sun for half an\r\nhour daily for two or three days until most of the capsules have\r\nsplit. It is then shelled, and the clean seed laid on the floor of\r\nany building where it will remain dry. Sunning it _after_ shelling is\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\nThe sooner it is sown after it is shelled the better.\r\n\r\nIf for any reason it is necessary to keep it, say a fortnight or three\r\nweeks before sowing, it is best kept _towards_ germinating in layers\r\ncovered with dry mould. But if to be kept longer leave it on the dry\r\nfloor as above, taking care it is thinly spread (not more than one seed\r\nthick if you have space) and collected together, and re-spread every\r\nday to turn it.\r\n\r\nFor transport to a distance it should be placed in coarse gunny bags\r\nonly one-third filled. If these are shaken and turned daily during\r\ntransit a journey of a week will not very materially injure the seed.\r\n\r\nFor any long journey it is best placed in layers in boxes with\r\nthoroughly dry and fine charcoal between the layers, and sheets of\r\npaper here and there to prevent the charcoal running to the bottom.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to consider how Tea seed can be utilized when\r\nnot saleable, for seed prevents leaf, and therefore it should not be\r\ngrown if there is no market for it. It will, however, make oil, but\r\nthe price it would fetch for this purpose would not compensate for\r\nthe diminished yield of leaf it had caused. It is also valuable as\r\nmanure mixed with cattle-dung, but it would not pay to grow it for this\r\npurpose either.\r\n\r\nMy advice therefore is to allow no more seed on the garden than you\r\nrequire for your own use (even the fullest gardens require some yearly)\r\nor than you can sell at a remunerative price.\r\n\r\nIf the object is to produce a considerable quantity of seed, set apart\r\na piece of the plantation for it, and do not prune it at all. A large\r\nnumber will then be produced on that piece.\r\n\r\nIf the object is to grow as little seed as possible after the pruning\r\nin the cold weather, which destroys the greater part, send round boys\r\nto pick off such of the germs as remain.\r\n\r\nIf this is done ever so carefully, some will escape, enough say to give\r\none maund seed from 10 acres of garden, and this as a rule is enough to\r\nfill up vacancies in a good garden.\r\n\r\nThe following figures regarding seed will be found useful, but remember\r\nthe higher the class of plant the less durable the seed:--\r\n\r\nSeven maunds seed, with capsules, give 4 mds. clean seed.\r\n\r\n  One maund clean seed (fresh)           =26,000 seeds.\r\n        „      „         (ten days old)  =32,000   „\r\n        „      „         (one month old) =35,000   „\r\n\r\nSay therefore, in round numbers, that one maund Tea seed=30,000 seeds.\r\n\r\nWith good Tea seed, sown shortly after it is picked, about 20,000 will\r\ngerminate.\r\n\r\nIf you get 8,000 to germinate with seed that has come a long distance,\r\nyou are lucky.\r\n\r\nAfter a two months’ journey 3,000 is probably the outside which will be\r\nrealised.\r\n\r\nMy experience, with seed imported into another District from Assam or\r\nCachar, is that more than 4,500 Seedlings cannot be expected from each\r\nmaund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON BETWEEN SOWING IN NURSERIES AND IN SITU.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the one case the seed is placed in nurseries at the close of the\r\nyear, and the young plants transplanted into the garden at beginning of\r\nthe following rains.\r\n\r\nIn the other the seed is (at the same time, viz., close of the year, if\r\nyou can get it so soon) sown at once in the plantation where the plants\r\nare intended to grow.\r\n\r\nEach of these plans has its advocates, who don’t believe in the other\r\nplan at all! The question is which is the better?\r\n\r\nTheir respective advantages may be shortly summed up as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSERIES.\r\n\r\n_Advantages._--The seed may be made to germinate early by watering.\r\nAfter it germinates the plants can be watered from time to time as they\r\nrequire it. Artificial shade (a great help to the germination of Tea\r\nseed) can be given. The soil can be frequently opened, and the plants\r\nin every way better tended in nurseries.\r\n\r\n_Disadvantages._--The plants lose at least three months’ growth when\r\ntransplanted, and may die. The transplanting necessitates labour at\r\nthe time of the year it is much wanted for other work. The expense is\r\ngreater than the other plan, for there are the nurseries to make and\r\nthe labour of transplanting.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN SITU.\r\n\r\n_Advantages._--The plants gain some three months in growth by not being\r\nmoved. It saves labour at the busy time, viz., early in the rains.\r\nIt saves all the labour of transplanting, that is, it _saves_ labour\r\nabsolutely, and _gives_ labour when, as stated, it is much required.\r\n\r\n_Disadvantages._--If the early rains (that is, rain in December,\r\nJanuary, and February) fail, but few seeds germinate. In the case of\r\na new garden, the soil must be kept clean six or seven months before\r\nit would be necessary by the nursery plan. No artificial shade can be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the advocates of both plans have much to urge\r\nin their respective favours. Which is better?\r\n\r\nThe advocates of each plan are guided by the climate they have planted\r\nTea in, and the truth is simply that the better plan for one place is\r\nnot adapted to another. Planting _in situ_ where it will succeed is\r\nby far the cheaper and better, and it will do so wherever there are\r\ncertainly cold weather and spring rains. Thus (see rain table) it will\r\noften succeed in Assam, Cachar, Darjeeling, the Western Dooars, and\r\nperhaps the Terai below Darjeeling. It will fail in Chittagong, Dehra\r\nDhoon, Kumaon, Kangra, and Hazareebaugh. In Chittagong, for instance,\r\na garden could never be made by planting _in situ_, or, as it is\r\ngenerally called, at stake.[20]\r\n\r\nIn this and other matters adapt your operations to the existing climate.\r\n\r\nI will now describe the above two methods of sowing seed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[20] In no climate is the success of it certain, for early rains often\r\nfail, and then it is all loss. I would, therefore, in all cases advise\r\nnurseries in reserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSOWING SEED IN SITU, ID EST, AT STAKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is named “at stake” because stakes are put along in lines to show\r\nwhere the Tea trees are to be, and the seed is sown at those spots.\r\n\r\nThe _modus operandi_ is very simple. A month before the sowing time\r\n(which should be as soon as you can get the seed), at each stake dig a\r\nhole at least 9 inches diameter and 12 inches deep, put the soil taken\r\nout on the sides, taking care, however, if it be on a slope, to put\r\nnone _above_ the hole. Do not put the soil near enough to the pit to\r\nmake it likely it will be washed back. Such soil as should be washed in\r\nought to be the new rich surface soil. For this reason the upper side\r\nof the hole should be left free on slopes. The pits are made a month\r\nbeforehand to admit of this, and to allow the action of the air on the\r\nopen sides to improve the mould.\r\n\r\nIf lucky enough to have one or two falls of rain during the month, the\r\nholes will be more or less filled up with soil eminently calculated\r\nto instigate rapid growth. Just before sowing fill up the pit with\r\nsurrounding _surface_ soil. Whether to mix a little manure with it\r\nor not is a question. If it is virgin soil, and rich in decayed\r\nvegetation, I say no; if not virgin soil, and rather poor, yes; but it\r\nmust be strictly in moderation--not more, say, than a man can hold in\r\nboth hands to each hole. In filling up the hole, press the soil down\r\nlightly two or three times, or it will all sink later, and your seeds\r\nbe far too deep.\r\n\r\nWhen the above is all done, there is a perfect spot for the reception\r\nof the seed. The tap-root can readily descend in search of moisture,\r\nand the lateral rootlets can spread likewise. They (the latter) will\r\nnot reach the outer walls of the pit for six months, and will then be\r\nstrong enough to force their way through.\r\n\r\nNow sow the seed. Put in, say, two or three, as the seed is good or\r\nbad, six inches apart; push them into the soft soil one inch, and put\r\nup the stake in the centre to mark the spot.\r\n\r\nKeep the place clean till following rains, but allow only hand-weeding\r\nnear the young seedlings, and occasionally open the soil with some\r\nlight hand-instrument, as a “koorpee,” to the depth of half-an-inch.\r\n\r\nIf all the seeds germinate, and the seedlings escape crickets, and all\r\nlive, at commencement of the rains leave the best and transplant the\r\nothers to any vacant spot. You will succeed with some, not with others;\r\nbut do not be too anxious to take up the spare ones with earth round\r\nthe roots, and thus endanger the one plant left. That the seedling left\r\nbe not injured is the _great_ point, the others must take their chance.\r\n\r\nSome people believe in two, or even three seedlings together, and would\r\nthus advise them to be all, or perhaps two, left. I do not approve of\r\nthe plan, except, perhaps, with Chinese plants. Plant as close as you\r\nwill in the lines, but give each plant its own home.\r\n\r\nThere is another mode of planting at stake, which is, I think, better\r\nthan the above.\r\n\r\nLay the seed in alternate layers of seed and mould in beds. The seeds\r\nmay be laid _close_ to each other, but not _above_ each other, with\r\nmould, say, two inches thick, above, and then seed again. When they\r\nbegin to burst, ready to shoot out their roots, examine the seeds, by\r\ntaking off the soil from each layer, every three or four days. Take\r\nout those that _have_ burst, and plant with the eye or root side of\r\nthe seed downwards. Put all that have _not_ burst back again. Repeat\r\nthe operation again and again every second or third day. Be careful and\r\ntake them up before the root projects--that is, directly the coating\r\nhas cracked.\r\n\r\nBy this means only one seed need be put at each stake, for it is\r\ncertain to germinate, and seed may thus be made to go much further.\r\nGreat care is, however, necessary in this operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nNURSERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nChoose a level site, with, if possible, the command of water\r\nat a higher level--anyhow with water handy. Either irrigating\r\nor hand-watering for seed beds is a necessity if vigorous and\r\nwell-developed plants are to be looked for.\r\n\r\nThe soil should be of the light, friable kind recommended for the\r\nTea-plant (see “Soil”) and of the same _nature_ as the soil of the\r\ngarden, the ultimate home of the plants. This latter is all-important,\r\nfor seedlings will never thrive (probably not live) transplanted into\r\na new kind of mould, particularly a poorer kind.\r\n\r\nIf possible, the soil of the seed beds should be poorer than the soil\r\nof the garden--on no account richer. Taking care it is of the same\r\n_nature_ as the garden soil, choose the poorest you can find. The\r\nprinciple is well known in England, and it applies equally to India.\r\nFrom poor to rich soil plants thrive, but never the other way.\r\n\r\nFor the above reason, if you manure seed beds, do it very sparingly.\r\n\r\nArtificial shade for seed beds is a necessity; at least very many more\r\nseeds will germinate when it is given.\r\n\r\nNatural shade over seed beds is _very_ bad; for, _firstly_, “the\r\ndrippings” are highly injurious; and, _secondly_, shade is only\r\nrequired till the plants are two or three inches high; after that _any_\r\nshade is bad, for plants brought up to the time of transplanting in\r\nshade are never very hardy.\r\n\r\nSeed beds, where water is handy, should not be dug deep. If so dug,\r\nand the soil is consequently loose a long way down, the tap-root will\r\ndescend quickly, and will be too long when transplanted. As water can\r\nbe given when it is necessary, there is no need for the tap-root to go\r\ndown low in search of moisture.[21] A long tap-root is generally broken\r\nin “lifting” the seedling from the bed.\r\n\r\nSeed beds raised, as is the usual custom, above the paths that run\r\nbetween them, are objectionable. They part with moisture too freely.\r\nThey should, on the contrary, be below the level of the paths, and\r\nthere is another advantage in this, for the said paths can then be used\r\npartly as supports for the artificial shade, and thus do away with the\r\nexpense of long wooden stakes.\r\n\r\nAs the seed beds are only required until the beginning of the following\r\nrains, there is no possibility of their suffering from excessive\r\nmoisture. When they are required to remain later, of course this plan\r\nof making the beds lower than the paths will not do.\r\n\r\nSeed is best sown in drills, six inches apart, and each seed two,\r\nor if space can be got, even three inches from its neighbour. This\r\nfacilitates each seedling being taken up later, with more or less\r\nof a ball of earth round the roots--an all-important point (see\r\nTransplanting, page 76).\r\n\r\nThe length of the beds does not signify, but the breadth must not be\r\nmore than five feet, so that a man on the path on either side can reach\r\nto the middle while hand-weeding or opening the soil.\r\n\r\nAfter what has been said no lengthy directions for making the beds are\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nCut down, burn, or carry off all jungle, and then take out all roots,\r\nwhether grass or other. Now make the surface level. After this mark\r\noff the beds and paths, the latter one foot broad only, with string\r\nand pegs. Then raise the path six inches above the spots marked off\r\nfor the beds. This latter must not be done by earth from the beds, but\r\nby earth from outside the intended nursery. Next dig and pulverise the\r\nsoil of the beds to a depth of six or seven inches, no more, and level\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nAll is now ready for the seed. A string, five feet long, with a small\r\npeg at either end, is given to two men who stand on the path at either\r\nside of the bed. Each man has a six-inch measure. The string is laid\r\nacross the bed, beginning at one end and pegged down on either side.\r\nA drill is then made along the string about one inch deep, and this\r\ndone the string is, by means of the six-inch measure on either side,\r\nremoved, and pegged down again in the place for the next drill. Seeds\r\nare then sown or placed along the first drill made, two or three inches\r\napart, and the earth filled in. This is repeated again and again till\r\nthe whole bed is sown.\r\n\r\nIf the character of the seed is doubtful it must be laid in thicker,\r\nbut with good seed two-and-a-half to three inches is the best distance.\r\n\r\nThe sowing finished the artificial shade has to be given. Along the\r\npaths, at five feet apart, put in forked stakes, two feet long--viz.,\r\nsix inches into the path, and eighteen inches above it. Connect these\r\nwith one another by poles laid in the forks; now lay other (but\r\nthinner) poles attached to the first poles at either end _across_\r\nand above the bed; and again across these latter, that is along _the\r\nlength_ of the beds, split bamboos, and then bind the whole framework\r\nhere and there. The said framework made will then be two feet above\r\nthe beds--viz., eighteen inches of stake support, and the six-inch\r\nraised paths. The eighteen inches of opening all round, under the\r\nframe, that is, between the frame and the path, allows the necessary\r\nair to circulate; while the expense, danger from high winds, and the\r\nobjectionable entrance of the sun at the sides, all of which high\r\nartificial shade is subject to, are avoided by this low frame-work.\r\n\r\nMats are the best to cover the frame-work. In case of accidental or\r\nincendiary fire they are not so objectionable as grass, for they burn\r\nless and slower, but mats are expensive. Any coarse grass (freed from\r\nseed) will answer, and it should be laid on as thin as will suffice to\r\ngive shade.\r\n\r\nThe beds may be watered, if there is no rain, a fortnight after the\r\nseed is sown, and from time to time during the dry season, whenever the\r\nsoil at a depth of three or four inches shows no moisture.\r\n\r\nThe soil should also be kept free of weeds, and after the plants are\r\nthree or four inches high, the spaces between the drills should be\r\nslightly stirred every now and then.\r\n\r\nAfter the seed has germinated, and the seedlings have, say, four leaves\r\non them, the artificial shade should be taken away. But it must be done\r\ngradually, taking off portions of the grass first, so that the young\r\nseedlings may by degrees be inured to the hot sun.\r\n\r\nThough cultivation, as described, by watering and opening the soil at\r\ntimes is well, these should not be done much, or the seedlings will\r\nbe too large when the time comes to transplant them. Large seedlings\r\ndo not, as a rule, thrive as well as moderate-sized ones, after being\r\ntransplanted.\r\n\r\nAmong the many very absurd mistakes made in the cultivation of the\r\nTea plant, none exceeds the ridiculous way Tea seed used to be sown\r\nin the Government plantations in the North-western Himalayas. The\r\nseed was sown in drills, as I have advised, but in six linear inches\r\nof the drills, where it is right to put two, or at most three, seeds,\r\nperhaps thirty were placed! I do not exaggerate; the drill, six inches\r\ndeep, was filled with them. Many and many lacs of seed, in those days\r\nworth many thousand rupees, were thus sacrificed. Private planters in\r\nthe Himalayas, taught by the Government method, once did the same. I\r\nbelieve the absurd practice is exploded now.\r\n\r\nSeed cannot be sown too soon after being picked. It is ripe early in\r\nNovember, so the beds should be all ready by November, and if the seed\r\nhas not far to come it can thus be sown early that month.\r\n\r\nTo each maund there are in round numbers 30,000 seeds, (see page 56).\r\nThe number of plants it will take to fill an acre depends, of course,\r\non the distances they are set apart (see page 72), but having decided\r\nthis point, also the area to be planted, and consequently the number of\r\nmaunds of seeds to be sown (see page 56), the following table will be\r\nfound useful in calculating the size of nursery required:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Table showing the size of nursery required for one maund and ten\r\n  maunds seed, the drills being 6 inches apart, and each seed 3 inches\r\n  or 2 inches from its neighbour._\r\n\r\n  -------------+-----------+------------------+---------------+----------------\r\n  Distance each|Area in sq.|Area, in sq. feet,|Area, including|Size of nursery,\r\n  seed is set  |inches each|of beds without   |paths required |including the\r\n  apart in the |seed   will|paths required for|for each md.   |paths to take in\r\n  drill.       |occupy.    |each md.          |               |for 10 mds.\r\n  -------------+-----------+------------------+---------------+----------------\r\n   3 inches    |       18  |        3,763     |4,513 sq. feet |  100 yards\r\n               |           |                  |       or      |      by\r\n               |           |                  | 501 sq. yards.|   50 yards.\r\n               |           |                  |               |\r\n   2 inches    |       12  |        2,500     |2,995 sq. feet |  100 yards\r\n               |           |                  |       or      |      by\r\n               |           |                  | 332 sq. yards.|   33 yards.\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf nurseries for more than ten maunds are required, then allow 100\r\nyards to be the breadth, and for each extra ten maunds add respectively\r\nfor 3 or 2 inches (see 1st column) 50 or 33 yards to the length. Thus\r\nfifty maunds will require nurseries 100 yards by 250 yards, or 100\r\nyards by 165 yards, according as it is decided to plant the seed 3\r\ninches or 2 inches apart in the lines.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[21] In planting “at stake” (see last Chapter) the conditions are\r\ndifferent. There the plant is in its permanent home, and the more\r\nquickly and deeper the tap-root descends the better, as the plant will\r\nthen draw moisture from low down when the soil is dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nMANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn idea existed formerly--got, I believe, from stray Chinamen, who I\r\ndon’t think knew much about Tea in any way--that manure, though it\r\nincreased the yield, spoilt the flavour of Tea. The idea is opposed to\r\nall agricultural knowledge, for high cultivation, which in no case can\r\nbe carried out to perfection without manure, much improves the strength\r\nand flavour of all edibles, the product of mother-earth.\r\n\r\nMy first experience of manure to the Tea plant was obtained in the\r\nChittagong district from a small garden close to the station, which has\r\nbeen for some years highly manured. I was struck with the frequency and\r\nabundance of the flushes and the strength and flavour of the Tea. My\r\nhigh opinion of the Tea was later borne out by the Calcutta brokers. I\r\nallude to the “Pioneer” garden, close to the Chittagong station. During\r\nthe best Tea months flush succeeded flush at intervals of less than a\r\nweek, while eight to ten maunds (640 to 800 lbs.) was the yearly yield\r\nper acre! The soil was very sandy and poor.\r\n\r\nAfter-experience showed me that manuring nearly doubles the yield of\r\nplants, and that so far from injuring the flavour of Tea it improves\r\nit, while it adds greatly to the strength.\r\n\r\nI shall therefore beg the question that manure _is_ an advantage. If\r\nany planter doubts, let him try it, and his doubts will soon be solved.\r\n\r\nAny manure is better than none, but I believe one of the best manures\r\nfor the Tea plant (always excepting night-soil and the excrements of\r\nbirds, which cannot be procured) is cattle manure. It is not heating,\r\nlike horse-dung, and may be applied in large quantities without any\r\nrisk. The fresher it is applied, in my opinion, the better, for it has\r\nthen far more power. If mixed with any vegetable refuse, the bulk being\r\nincreased, it will go further, but I do not think it is intrinsically\r\nany the better for it.\r\n\r\nThere are several chemical manures advertised for Tea plants. “Money\r\nand Ponder’s Chemical Manure,” lately patented by Mr. Ponder and\r\nmyself, is said to have been very successful on several gardens. It is\r\nmanufactured by Mr. J. Thompson, Kooshtea, Bengal, who will supply all\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nAll garden refuse should be regarded as manure and buried between the\r\nplants. I allude to the prunings of the bushes and the weeds at all\r\ntimes from the land. To carry these off the ground, as I have sometimes\r\nseen done, is simply taking off so much strength from the soil. The\r\ngreener, too, all this is buried the better.\r\n\r\nWhen it is considered how much is taken from the Tea plant, it is\r\nevident the soil will be exhausted, sooner or later, if no means are\r\nadopted to repair the waste. Where manure cannot be got the waste must\r\nbe made up, as far as possible, by returning all other growth to the\r\nsoil. But manure _should_ be got if possible, for it will double the\r\nyield of a garden; and highly concentrated chemical manures will, I am\r\nsure, be eventually much used on Tea gardens.\r\n\r\nThe best way to apply it, if enough manure is procurable, is round each\r\nplant; not close to the stem (the rootlets by which the plant feeds\r\nare not there) but about 1 foot from it. Dig a round trench with a\r\n_kodalee_, about 9 inches wide and 6 inches deep, at the above distance\r\nfrom the stem, lay in the manure, and replace the soil at top. If\r\nthe plants are young the trench should be narrower, shallower, and 6\r\ninches, instead of 1 foot, from the stems.\r\n\r\nIf enough manure is not procurable for this (the best) plan, the most\r\nmust be done with what can be got, as follows:--If the plants are full\r\ngrown, and there is say 4 feet between the lines, dig a trench down the\r\ncentre and lay in the manure. The plants will then be manured on two\r\nsides. If the plants are young lay the manure _near_ them on two sides,\r\nif possible, but failing that even on one side. The principle is to lay\r\nthe manure at the distance the feeding rootlets are, and the older the\r\nplant the greater distance these are from its stem.\r\n\r\nAs to the quantity of cattle manure. Say for plants four years old and\r\nupwards (if younger, less will be an equivalent) one maund to 20 trees\r\nis a moderate dose, one maund to 15 trees a good dose, and one maund to\r\n10 trees highly liberal manuring, and as much as the plants can take up.\r\n\r\nSay in round numbers each acre contains 2,500 plants (4 by 4--a usual\r\ndistance--gives 2,722 plants, as shown at page 72), and say the manure\r\nis procurable at three annas a maund.[22]\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the expense of each degree of manuring, viz.,\r\n10, 15, and 20 trees per maund:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Table showing the possible cost and result of manuring with cattle\r\nmanure._\r\n\r\n  Key:\r\n\r\n  A: Maunds of manure per acre at 2,500 plants per acre\r\n  B: Cost of manure at 3 annas per maund _N.B._--Ans. omitted\r\n  C: Probable extra yield of Tea per acre\r\n  D: Value of extra yield of Tea at Rs. 50 per maund\r\n  E: Profit by manuring per acre\r\n  F: Deducting the probable cost of putting in the manure, the following\r\n        profit is shown per acre\r\n\r\n  --------------------+------+-----+-------+------+-----+----\r\n                      |      |     |       |      |     |\r\n  Rate of Manuring    |      |     |       |      |     |\r\n                      | A    |  B  |  C    | D    |  E  |  F\r\n                      |      |     |       |      |     |\r\n                      |      |     |       |      |     |\r\n  --------------------+------+-----+-------+------+-----+----\r\n                      | Mds. | Rs. |  Mds. |  Rs. | Rs. | Rs.\r\n  One md. to 10 plants| 250  | 47  | 2-1/2 | 125  | 78  | 70\r\n  One md. to 15 plants| 166  | 31  |   2   | 100  | 69  | 62\r\n  One md. to 20 plants| 125  | 23  | 1-1/2 |  75  | 52  | 46\r\n  --------------------+------+-----+-------+------+-----+----\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to calculate that this will add respectively 1-1/2,\r\n2, and 2-1/2 maunds of Tea per acre to the yield, and I have carried\r\nthis out in the table and shown the results.\r\n\r\nI quite believe the results shown will be obtained by manuring, and I\r\nbase my opinion on practice not theory.\r\n\r\n_N.B._--I have deducted Rs. 8 for the first, Rs. 7 for the second, and\r\nRs. 6 for the third, as the probable cost of putting in the manure, as\r\nit may have to be carried from the factory to the garden.

Cultivation here means digging, and space enough for this must\r\nbe left between the lines. Giving so much, what is then the principle\r\nthat should guide us? Clearly, with a view to the largest yield\r\nobtainable, to place as many plants on the land as it will bear.\r\n\r\nFour or 4-1/2 feet are, I think, the best distances between the lines.\r\n\r\nThey give space enough for air to cultivate, and to pass along, even\r\nwhen the trees are full grown.\r\n\r\nWhere manure is obtainable and the soil can be kept up to a rich state\r\nby yearly applications, a garden can scarcely be planted too close.\r\n\r\nI see no objection to trees touching each other in the lines.\r\n\r\nOn considerable slopes, to prevent the wash of soil, the plants should\r\nbe placed as close as possible, say 3-1/2 feet between and 2 feet in\r\nthe lines.\r\n\r\nA closely planted garden will grow less weeds than a widely planted\r\none, and will consequently be cheaper to work.\r\n\r\nAs the expenditure on a garden is in direct proportion to the area,\r\nand the yield in direct proportion to the number of plants (always\r\nsupposing there is power enough in the soil to support them), it\r\nfollows that a closely planted garden _must_ be very much more\r\nprofitable than the reverse.\r\n\r\nHybrid plants grow to a larger size than Chinese, and should therefore\r\nhave more room.\r\n\r\nThe following is a useful table:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Table showing the Plants to an Acre, and the Area one lakh of\r\nseedlings will cover, at the distances named._\r\n\r\n  -------------+---------+----------+---------------+------------------\r\n               | Square  |          |The area in    |\r\n  Distances in | ft.     |Plants in |acres one lakh |   REMARKS\r\n      feet     |to each  | one acre |of seedlings   |\r\n               | plant   |          |will cover     |\r\n  -------------+---------+----------+---------------+------------------\r\n  6    by 6    |  36     |  1,210   |   82-1/2}     |\r\n  6     „ 5    |  30     |  1,452   |   69    }     |\r\n  6-1/2 „ 4    |  26     |  1,675   |   59-3/4}     | Too wide for any\r\n  5     „ 5    |  25     |  1,742   |   57-1/2}     |      plants.\r\n  6     „ 4    |  24     |  1,815   |   55    }     |\r\n               |         |          |               |\r\n  6     „ 3-1/2|  21     |  2,074   |   48    }     | For Hybrids, but\r\n  5     „ 4    |  20     |  2,178   |   45-1/2}     | still I think too\r\n               |         |          |               |      wide.\r\n               |         |          |               |\r\n  6     „  3   |  18     |  2,420   |   41-1/4}     |  Good distances\r\n  4     „  4   |  16     |  2,722   |   36-3/4}     |    for Hybrids.\r\n  5     „  3   |  15     |  2,904   |   34-1/2}     |\r\n               |         |          |               |\r\n  4     „  3   |  12     |  3,630   |   27-1/2}     | Chinese for early\r\n               |         |          |               |      return.\r\n  3-1/2 „ 3-1/2|  12-1/4 |  3,555   |   28    }     |\r\n  3-1/2 „ 3    |  10-1/2 |  4,148   |   24    }     |      Chinese.\r\n               |         |          |               |\r\n  6     „ 3-1/4|  19-1/2 |  2,233   |   44-3/4}     |      Hybrid.\r\n               |         |          |               |\r\n  5     „ 3-1/4|  16-1/4 |  2,726   |   36-3/4}     |     Chinese.\r\n  5     „ 3-1/2|  17-1/2 |  2,489   |   40    }     |\r\n               |         |          |               |\r\n  3-1/2 „ 2    |   7     |  6,223   |   16          | Best distance for\r\n               |         |          |               | Chinese on steep\r\n               |         |          |               |       slopes.\r\n  -------------+---------+----------+---------------+------------------\r\n\r\n    On flat lands I advise--\r\n\r\n                  Hybrid, if high-class  4 × 3-1/2 or 4-1/2 × 4\r\n                  Chinese                            3 × 3\r\n\r\n    All the following equal one acre:--\r\n\r\n                       4 roods. 4,840 square yards.\r\n                     160 poles. 43,560  „    feet.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[23] Land _before_ it is planted can be cultivated with ploughs.

He finds the latter the\r\nbest. After ploughing he uses English harrows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMAKING A GARDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have not very much to say on this head, as most of the operations\r\nentailed are treated separately. Still a few directions on primary\r\nmatters are required.\r\n\r\nHaving selected a site and made arrangements for the Tea seed required\r\nfor the first year’s planting, you should commence operations early in\r\nOctober, either by constructing the nursery, or clearing land on the\r\nproposed site of the garden, as you may decide which mode of planting,\r\nviz., “nurseries,” or “sowing at stake,” to adopt.[24]\r\n\r\nIf the latter, you should begin to cut the jungle somewhat earlier, but\r\nit is no use beginning to do this before the middle of September in any\r\ncase, for before that the jungle would spring up again so soon that it\r\nwould be labour lost.\r\n\r\nBefore you do _anything_ decide how much you will cultivate the first\r\nyear, and make your arrangements for seed accordingly. Here let me\r\nadvise you in no case to attempt more than 100 acres. If you do 100\r\nreally well the first year you will have done _very_ well. Remember you\r\nhave also buildings (though few) to construct, and trying to do too\r\nmuch you may simply fail in all.\r\n\r\nPrevious to October you should have made yourself thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith all your land, so that you can then fix with knowledge on the best\r\nsites for your buildings, nursery, and Tea plantation.\r\n\r\nYou will find much on these matters in other chapters which should be\r\nread carefully.\r\n\r\nThese respective sites having been fixed upon, and supposing you are\r\ngoing to plant in both ways, from nurseries and _in situ_, construct\r\nthe nurseries as advised under that head, page 62, and also cut the\r\njungle on the intended garden site.\r\n\r\nThere is not much to say about cutting jungle. Cut all the brushwood\r\nfirst near the ground, and the big trees later, so that when they fall\r\nthey may lie on the underwood. In the portion you intend to plant at\r\nstake you will not have time to cut down the big trees, and had better\r\nsimply “ring” them. If this is properly done, that is, if the ring\r\nis broad enough and deep enough (less than one foot broad and five\r\ninches deep for large trees is not safe), they will certainly die in\r\na twelvemonth, and will not give objectionable shade more than half\r\nthat time. In the part to be planted “at stake” you must burn all the\r\ncut jungle by the end of October, and it will be well, if you have\r\nlabour enough, to send men up the big trees to cut off the branches\r\nbeforehand, so that they will more or less burn with the rest. Doing\r\nthis, and piling up the underwood to be burnt round the base of the big\r\ntrees, will cause earlier death, and diminish the objectionable shade.\r\n\r\nHaving burnt the jungle, that is, as much as will burn, and carried off\r\nthe rest from the parts to be planted at stake, dig out all the small\r\nroots, and that done, dig the whole some 4 or 5 inches deep. Then stake\r\nit off with small bamboo stakes 18 inches long, showing where the Tea\r\ntrees are to be (see page 72 as to the best distances), and then make\r\nyour holes and plant your seed at each stake as directed at page 59.\r\n\r\nSee the way it is recommended to stake land as regards its lay at pages\r\n45 and 46.\r\n\r\nYou will probably not have the ground ready before the end of November\r\n(do not attempt more than you can do to that date), and then take care\r\nand keep the seed, as directed at page 55, until it is sown.\r\n\r\nFor the part to be planted from nurseries the following June you have\r\nplenty of time. Nowhere have I, or anyone, seen large vigorous Tea\r\nplants under trees. It is therefore evident trees are hurtful, and no\r\nmore should be left in a garden than are required for the labourers to\r\nsit under occasionally, and to collect leaf under before it is taken\r\nto the Tea-house. The trees that are left should be those on the sides\r\nof roads. One to every two or three acres is ample. After therefore\r\ncutting down all the low jungle, cut down all but the said few trees\r\n(it is cheaper in the end than ringing them), and then cut off and cut\r\nup all the branches into sizes that will burn readily. Cut up the large\r\ntrunks also into lengths, for all that will not burn must be carried\r\noff later. Leave all so lying until February, then choose a day with a\r\nhigh wind and fire it from the windward side. It may burn some days.\r\nThen collect all unburnt into heaps, and fire again and again until\r\nnothing more will burn. Now take out all roots, big and small, and when\r\nwell dry, stack all these, and what was left before, and fire again and\r\nagain. The land should now be tolerably clear, and can be dug at once.\r\nThe roads should be marked off before this, for they are better not dug.\r\n\r\nNow stake the land at the distances determined on, and a month before\r\nthe rains, or even more, if you are so far advanced, make holes for\r\nthe young seedlings at each stake, precisely like those recommended\r\nfor “planting at stake,” page 59. Only, if possible, these should be a\r\nlittle larger each way than there advised, say 10 inches diameter and\r\n15 inches deep.\r\n\r\nRead carefully the direction as to those pits, and follow them out\r\nhere. Much of the success of your planting depends on these holes.\r\n\r\nAt the first commencement of the rains transplant, as directed under\r\nthat head in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nAny large heavy trunks, which cannot be easily carried off the land,\r\nmay be placed longways between the lines, but the less of dead timber\r\nyou leave lying about the gardens the better.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[24] In no case trust to the latter alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTRANSPLANTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the pits for the plants have been all prepared, as directed at pages\r\n59 and 75, this operation is simple enough.\r\n\r\nA fortnight or so before it commences tip all the seedlings in the\r\nnursery. Take off only the closed leaf at the head of each young plant\r\n(see a leaf diagram, page 104), so that the bud at the base of the next\r\nleaf be not injured. Doing this will make the seedlings hardier and\r\nenable them earlier to recover the transplanting.\r\n\r\nOn the day you intend to take up the seedlings from any bed, if you\r\nhave water enough at command, flood the bed. This, as you take up each\r\nseedling, will cause the soil, being moist, to adhere better to the\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nThe difference between young plants transplanted with a ball of earth\r\nround the roots, and those moved with their roots bare, is no less than\r\nthree months’ growth, if even it does not make the difference between\r\nlife and death.\r\n\r\nProceed thus to ensure the former. At one short end of the bed, the\r\nlowest if it is on a slope, dig close to the first row of seedlings a\r\ntrench so deep that its base shall be lower than the lowest end of the\r\ntap-roots. Then with a five or six-pronged steel fork (this is better\r\nthan a spade, for it does not cut the rootlets) put in between the\r\nfirst and second row, and pressed down with the foot to its head, force\r\ncarefully so much of the row down into the trench. Then with the hand\r\ntake up each seedling separately, helping the soil with a very light\r\npressure (so light that it shall not change the lateral direction of\r\nany of the rootlets) to adhere, and place it in a low basket sloping.\r\nDo this again and again, till two baskets are full, when they will be\r\ncarried, banghy fashion, to the garden.\r\n\r\nWhen the first row is finished clear away the loose soil, so that a\r\nsimilar trench to the first shall be formed, and then proceed as above\r\nwith the second row, and so on.\r\n\r\nNo further directions for lifting the seedlings out of the nurseries\r\nare required.\r\n\r\nAll is ready for their reception in the garden if the directions at\r\npages 59 and 75 have been followed out. The work now to be detailed\r\nmust be done by careful men well superintended.\r\n\r\nIn the soft soil of the lately filled up pit, described at page 59, a\r\nhole is made either with the hand or a narrow kodalee (the former, if\r\nthe soil has not settled much, will suffice), large enough and deep\r\nenough to take in the seedling with all the earth attached to it. The\r\nseedling is then put in and the soil filled in and round it, which\r\ncompletes the operation.\r\n\r\nThe manner, though, in which this is done is of great consequence. Four\r\nthings are all important:--(1) That the tap-root shall not be turned\r\nup at the end because the hole is too shallow. (2) That any rootlets\r\nprojecting outside the attached earth shall be laid in the hole, and\r\nshall preserve, when the soil is filled in, their lateral direction.\r\n(3) That the collar of the plant (the spot where the stem entered the\r\nearth in the nursery) shall be, when the pit is filled up, about 1-1/2\r\ninch higher than the surface of the surrounding earth. (4) That in\r\nfilling in the hole the soil is pressed down enough to make it unlikely\r\nto sink later, but not enough to “cake” the mould.\r\n\r\nThe following is the consequence of failure in these four points:--\r\n\r\n1. Probably death, in any case very much retarded growth. I have\r\nplanted some seedlings so purposely, the majority died; those that\r\nlived recovered very slowly, and digging them up later the tap-root was\r\nfound to have gone down after all by assuming the shape of the letter\r\nS, the growth downwards being from the head of the letter.\r\n\r\n2. Rootlets, turned away from their lateral direction, interfere with\r\nother rootlets, and though they eventually grow right if the plant\r\nlives, they retard it.\r\n\r\n3. Fill in as you may (unless you “cake” the soil, which induces worse\r\nevils) the plant sinks a little; thus, if not placed a little high, it\r\nwill eventually be too deep. If on the other hand placed too high, the\r\nrootlets and collar will be exposed, which is an evil.\r\n\r\n4. Unless this is attended to the plant will sink too much and the\r\ncollar be buried; likewise an evil, which it takes the young seedling\r\nsome time to recover.\r\n\r\nOnly first teaching and then practice will enable either European or\r\nNative to plant well. This is how it should be done.\r\n\r\nTake the seedling in the left hand, holding it by the stem just above\r\nthe collar; then take the very end of the tap-root between the second\r\nand third fingers of the right hand, and thus put it down into the hole\r\n(you thus insure the tap-root being straight). Now judge exactly the\r\nheight of the collar that it be as directed. Rest the left arm then on\r\nthe ground to keep the plant steady, release the tap-root, and fill up\r\nthe hole about one-third, pressing the soil lightly. The plant will\r\nthen be fixed, and you can employ both hands to fill up the remainder,\r\nand keep the rootlets in a lateral position. Press the soil lightly\r\nas you do so, and when all is filled up press it down a little harder\r\nround the stem of the plant.\r\n\r\nAll the transplanting should be finished as early in the rains as\r\npossible. A seedling, planted in the first fifteen days of June, is\r\nworth two planted in July, and after the latter month it is generally\r\na case of seedlings and labour lost.\r\n\r\nDays with heavy rain are not good to plant in. Those with showers or\r\nlight drizzling rain are best. When there is very heavy rain the soil\r\n“cakes” much. Fine days, if the ground is wet, and if more rain may\r\nsoon be looked for, are good, better though if cloudy than sunny.\r\n\r\nWhere much planting has to be done, of necessity planting must be\r\ncarried on daily, for, as observed, it _must_ all be finished by end of\r\nJuly at latest.\r\n\r\nIn case of a sunny break in the weather, stop planting after the second\r\nday, for early rain to young transplants is a necessity.\r\n\r\nIn making a garden too much care cannot be given to the way seedlings\r\nare placed in their homes.\r\n\r\nJust before sending the third edition to press, I saw in the _Indian\r\nTea Gazette_ some details of “new transplanting and transporting\r\ntools,” patented by Mr. Jeben. I hope these will prove a success, for\r\nsuch are much wanted, and if they will do all it is said they can do, a\r\ngreat boon will have been conferred by Mr. Jeben on the Tea industry.\r\n\r\nMr. J. W. Mountjoy, of Pandawbrang, Arracan, writes as follows\r\nregarding these tools:--\r\n\r\n  “The Transplanter has, in working, proved to be a complete success.\r\n  Almost all the remaining seedlings have been transplanted by the\r\n  aid of your instrument, without the slightest injury to their roots\r\n  or check to their growth. The fact is, the young plants do not know\r\n  that they have been transplanted, and now that sunshine has succeeded\r\n  the late very heavy rains, new and vigorous growth is ‘bursting\r\n  out’ from all the seedlings that were transplanted by means of your\r\n  Transplanter. No manager of a Tea or Coffee plantation, who had once\r\n  seen this instrument at work, would ever again be likely to recur\r\n  to transplanting by hand, and not a single seedling should die when\r\n  removed from the nursery and carried to its place of ultimate growth\r\n  by means of your Transplanter. Your transplanting apparatus is better\r\n  than baskets, and has moreover the great recommendation of being very\r\n  economical. Your Transplanter will, with moderate care, last for many\r\n  years, and combines thorough economy with thorough efficiency.”\r\n\r\nI am glad to give the above extract, for I look on the invention, if\r\nsuccessful, as a most important one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF MADE GARDENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs manuring, which is part of this, is treated separately, we have here\r\nonly to consider the best means of stirring the soil to give air to the\r\nroots of the plants, and to keep down weeds, which, if allowed, injure\r\nthe yield vastly.\r\n\r\nUnless when plants are full blown and in full bearing (and not even\r\nthen unless they are planted close) it is not only not necessary, but\r\na waste of labour and money, to open the soil all over the garden with\r\na view of stimulating or cultivating the plants. Much money has been\r\nwasted in this way: for instance, in a garden planted 6 by 6 or 6 by 5,\r\nand the plants but two years old, I have seen the whole dug many times\r\nin the year. The roots of the said plants did not protrude at that age\r\nmore than 1 foot or so, what good could they possibly derive from the\r\nextra space dug?\r\n\r\nThe soil _over_ the rootlets of Tea plants cannot be stirred too often.\r\nThe oftener it is done the oftener the trees flush, and when young the\r\nmore vigorously will they grow. What is the best way to do it?\r\n\r\nI believe simply by digging _round_ each plant. I go to show why this\r\nis, I believe, the best.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the waste incurred in digging a whole garden when not\r\nnecessary, the way the soil is then dug near the plants is, I think,\r\nobjectionable. The ground is dug in a straight line _up to the plant_,\r\nand in doing so, if the digging is deep, roots are very apt to be cut.\r\nAgain, when the work is task-work, the men shirk as much as possible\r\ndigging close up to the stems under the branches, and thus the soil\r\nover much of the roots, is not stirred at all. This is not easy to\r\ndetect, for you must look under the branches of each tree to see how\r\nthe work has been done.\r\n\r\nIn “digging round plants” the men should _follow_ the kodalee round the\r\ntree, and _the position of the blade in the same line as the roots_\r\nmakes any injury very unlikely. Even if tasked, as when the work is\r\nexamined, it is _only_ round the plants, it is more readily perceived\r\nif the ground has not been stirred close up to the stems.\r\n\r\nI therefore prefer digging round plants, with the view of cultivating\r\nthem, to digging the whole garden. I believe the object is better\r\nattained. That it is much cheaper is evident.\r\n\r\nThe annulus, or space to be dug round, beginning 9 inches from the\r\nstem, varies with the age of the plant. Up to two years one kodalee in\r\nwidth will do, and after that say 2 feet.\r\n\r\nThe draw-hoe of 8 inches wide is a better tool for the above than\r\nthe kodalee, especially as it is work well suited to boys, and the\r\n“draw-hoe” is a lighter tool.\r\n\r\nTill plants from seed at stake are a year old, and till seedlings from\r\nnurseries are the same age, calculating in the latter case from the\r\ntransplanting, no kodalee or even draw-hoe should come near them. The\r\nsoil round for 6 inches should be slightly opened once a month or so,\r\nbut it should be done with the “koorpee.”\r\n\r\nWe have now discussed the cultivation of the plants. The above often\r\ndone, say once a month, if possible, during the season, with judicious\r\npruning and liberal manuring, constitutes high cultivation. Did weeds\r\nnot grow there would be no need to do more, but weeds _do_ grow, and\r\nmust not be allowed. The richer the soil the more weeds, the more\r\nmanure you apply the more weeds also.\r\n\r\nWeeds choke the plant and diminish the yield. Weeds take from the\r\nsoil, and from manure, when given, the strength you want for your\r\nconstantly recurring flushes. If, therefore, you have a large crop of\r\nweeds you have a small yield of Tea.\r\n\r\nHow to stop this? There is one golden rule, “never let them get ahead\r\nof you.” This, it is true, argues ample labour; but unless you _have_\r\nample labour for the area you cultivate, better let your money lie in\r\nthe Bank and not grow Tea. Reduce your area until you _can_ keep ahead\r\nof your weeds, for keep ahead you must if you wish for success.\r\n\r\nThe secret of keeping ahead of weeds is to destroy them when young, to\r\ndo this again and again, as often as they come up, never allowing them\r\nto bear seed. The kodalee, an excellent digging tool, is not good for\r\nthis: you want a lighter instrument, which can go over more ground and\r\nwill not open the soil in the dry season to any depth. The Dutch hoe,\r\nthe widest procurable in the blade, with a long lithe handle of 6 feet,\r\nis perfect for this.\r\n\r\nWith weeds at the height fit for a Dutch hoe, viz., 3 or 4 inches, and\r\nnot numerous (which they will not be if you have “kept ahead”), a man\r\nwill easily do 45 square nulls, _id est_, 720 square yards. He would\r\nnot do more than 30 nulls with a kodalee.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch hoe must be well known. It is used for weeding drives and\r\nwalks in England.\r\n\r\nTo conclude shortly, for “hoeing and weeding” I recommend as follows:--\r\n\r\nDig the whole garden thrice in the year, viz., spring, rains, and\r\nautumn. Bury all weeds as you dig in trenches between the lines.\r\n\r\nIn the intervals use the Dutch hoe as often as weeds appear.\r\n\r\nCultivate the plants by digging round them once a month if possible.\r\n\r\nDo all this and you will find your garden is kept clean and well\r\ncultivated, at far less cost than you incurred for cultivation when it\r\nwas choked with weeds for months together, while your yield will be at\r\nthe same time much increased.\r\n\r\nIf you keep your garden thus clean, and do not allow the weeds to\r\nget ahead of you, the following table shows about the cost of each\r\ncultivation operation each time you do it:--\r\n\r\n  Key:\r\n\r\n  A: Digging the whole surface\r\n  B: Digging round plants\r\n  C: Dutch hoeing or weeding\r\n  ----------------+----------+--------+---------+---------+------+------\r\n                  | Headman  | Men at |  Women  | Boys at |Total |Say in\r\n   Detail of work | at 4-1/2 | 3-1/2  |   at    | 2-1/2   |cost  | Rs.\r\n                  |  annas   |  annas | 3 annas |  annas  |      |\r\n  ----------------+  --------+--------+---------+---------+------+------\r\n          A       |   3/4    |    12  |    5    |   ..    |2|13|6|  3\r\n          B       |   1/2    |    ..  |    4    |    5    |1|13|9|  2\r\n          C       |   1/2    |     4  |   ..    |   ..    |1|14|3|  2\r\n  ----------------+----------+--------+---------+---------+------+------\r\n\r\nIf weeds get ahead the cost in each case will be nearly double the\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThe following table, which is as near the mark as any such estimate can\r\nbe, will be found useful. It will also be made use of when calculating\r\nthe cost of making a garden in Chapter XXIX., pages 164, 165, and 166.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Table showing the cost per annum of keeping up at its best 100 acres\r\n  of Tea from the year it is planted until the sixth year inclusive._\r\n\r\n  ------+-------------+-------------+----------------------------------\r\n   Year |Rate per acre|Per 100 acres|    Remarks\r\n        |  per annum  |             |\r\n  ------+-------------+-------------+----------------------------------\r\n        |     Rs.     |     Rs.     |\r\n  First |      50     |    5,000    |The year the seed is sown at stake\r\n  Second|      60     |    6,000    |\r\n  Third |      70     |    7,000    |\r\n  Fourth|      80     |    8,000    |\r\n  Fifth |      90     |    9,000    |\r\n  Sixth |     100     |   10,000    |The plants should be large plants\r\n        |             |             | now, but they will not be at full\r\n        |             |             | bearing until the eighth year.\r\n  ------+-------------+-------------+----------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe above rates in the case of a 300-acre garden making will include\r\n_everything_ but buildings.\r\n\r\nThe rates are progressive, because the expenditure on the following\r\nincreases, or should increase, yearly.\r\n\r\n  1. Manager’s pay (say every second year).\r\n  2. Assistant (first entertained, say third year).\r\n  3. Cost and wear of tools.\r\n  4. Cost of pruning.\r\n  5. Cost of cultivation.\r\n  6. Cost of manure.\r\n  7. General expenses.\r\n\r\nNo cost for Tea manufacture is included in the above, as this is\r\nestimated for separately. See table at pages 160, 161, and 162.\r\n\r\nKeeping up high cultivation in every way and manuring liberally, a made\r\ngarden in full bearing can be kept up to its highest producing powers\r\n(including the pay of the manager, establishment, and everything else)\r\nfor Rs. 100 per acre per annum.\r\n\r\nAn acre of Tea may, I am aware, be kept up in a manner for Rs. 50 or so\r\nyearly, but the profit on such a plantation must be nil.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, with the above expenditure per acre, on a good and\r\nfavourably located garden, the profit will be very large. See table at\r\npage 172.\r\n\r\nIt is with Tea as with all other cultivation. It has been proved in\r\nEngland, and in all other countries where really high cultivation is\r\nfollowed out, that the higher the system followed the greater the\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nPRUNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is stated elsewhere at length (page 102) _why_ I conceive pruning to\r\nbe necessary for the Tea plant. Whether I am right or not, the fact is\r\ncertain that without pruning very little leaf is produced.\r\n\r\nPruning must be done in the cold weather when the plant is hybernating,\r\nthat is to say, when the sap is down. The sooner _after_ the sap goes\r\ndown it is done the better, for the sooner the tree will then flush in\r\nthe spring.\r\n\r\nThere have been many theories about pruning Tea bushes, but none, I\r\nthink, worth much _practically_, for the simple reason that it is\r\nimpossible to prune 250,000 plants (the number in a 100-acre garden,\r\nat 2,500 to the acre)[25] with the care and system a gardener prunes\r\na favourite fruit tree. The operation _must_ be a coarse one, done by\r\nignorant men, in large numbers at one time, who can in a measure be\r\nmore or less taught, and the nearer they do right the better: still,\r\nreally careful and scientific pruning can never be carried out on a Tea\r\nplantation.\r\n\r\nThe time to do it, too, is very limited. It cannot be begun before the\r\ntrees have done flushing, say, at the earliest, middle of November, or\r\ncontinued, if early flushes and a large yield next season is looked\r\nfor, beyond end of January, at the latest. Thus at the most two months\r\nand a half is all the time given.\r\n\r\nI shall confine myself therefore to giving such directions as will be\r\npractically useful.\r\n\r\nThe best instrument is the common “pruning knife.” It cuts far cleaner\r\nthan the “shears,” besides which the natives very seldom use the latter\r\nwell. What is called in England a “hedge-bill” is useful to trim the\r\noutsides of the trees. If required it must be got from England, as I do\r\nnot think it is procurable in Calcutta. Whatever instruments are used\r\nshould be kept very sharp, and for this purpose, besides sharpening\r\nthem every morning on the grinding stone, each pruner should be\r\nprovided with a small pocket “hone.”\r\n\r\nThe theory, and it is correct, is in pruning, to cut near above a bud\r\nor branch, but not near enough to injure them. The cut should be quite\r\nclean and sloping upwards, so that nothing can lodge on it. This theory\r\ncan be, and must be, strictly carried out in cutting the thick stems\r\nand branches, but it is quite impossible to do it with the slender\r\nbranches or twigs of the tree.\r\n\r\nPrune so as to cause lateral growth. A Tea plant should never be\r\nallowed to exceed, say, 4 feet in height, but the wider it is the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nPrune off all lower branches tending downwards,[26] for the plant\r\nshould, if possible, be clean underneath to a height of, say, 6 inches.\r\nThis clean stem high class plants have naturally, not so the Chinese,\r\nor the Chinese cast of hybrid.\r\n\r\nPlants should be more or less pruned out in the centre. In the\r\nfollowing spring young wood is then formed in the heart of the tree,\r\nand it is only young wood and shoots that give leaf.\r\n\r\nPlants, if above two years old (see foot note next page), exceeding\r\n2-1/2 feet in height at the end of the season (and all plants of any\r\nage will) may be pruned down to 20 inches, but the thick wood must be\r\npruned down to varying heights several inches lower.\r\n\r\nSmall plants must naturally be more lightly pruned.\r\n\r\nThe best plan is, I think, to have two gangs:\r\n\r\nThe first to go ahead and cut out the thick wood (here judgment is\r\nnecessary, so let them be the best men) to varying heights, from about\r\n11 to 18 inches. The second gang to follow, each with a rod 20 inches\r\nlong, to cut down all the light wood left to that level.\r\n\r\nAll plants, how low or how young soever they may be, must be pruned\r\nsomewhat.[27] The lower their stature and the less their age the less\r\npruning they require.\r\n\r\nOf the two extremes, at least with the Tea plant, it is probably\r\nbetter to over than to under-prune. The treatment of the plants, with\r\nreference to the leaf to be taken in the spring, must be a good deal\r\nregulated by the way, or rather the extent, to which they have been\r\npruned. On this point see page 103.\r\n\r\nThe cost of pruning depends on whether it is high or low, and whether\r\nthe plants are large, middling, or small. The greatest cost is about\r\nRs. 6, the least about Rs. 3 per acre.\r\n\r\nLet all prunings be buried between the lines of plants, if possible,\r\nbefore the leaves have even withered. They make capital manure, but\r\nmuch of the virtue escapes if they are allowed to lie on the ground any\r\ntime before they are buried.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] In a 500-acre garden the number is 1,250,000, which _ought_ all to\r\nbe pruned in two months!\r\n\r\n[26] The best plan with the lowest branches is to _pull_ them off, with\r\na sharp downward action, as then they will not grow again.\r\n\r\n[27] But not before the end of 18 months after transplanting, as the\r\nobject at first is to get a long tap-root to draw moisture from low\r\ndown, and this is best attained by allowing the plant to grow as it\r\nwill. I look on this as all-important. I care not how high a plant may\r\ngrow, for 18 months I would in no way interfere with its growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nWHITE ANTS, CRICKETS, AND BLIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese insects (for blight, too, is said to be an insect) are very\r\ndestructive to the Tea plants. The cricket, however, only injures it\r\nwhen quite young, so we will consider that little pest first.\r\n\r\nWhen Tea seed germinates, and the young seedling is 2 or 3 inches high,\r\nthe cricket delights to cut the stem and carry, or try to carry, the\r\ntwo or three green leaves attached to the upper part into its hole.\r\nEven after seedlings are planted out, if the stems are slender, it cuts\r\nthem. To the young seedlings, in nurseries or planted “at stake,” they\r\noften do great harm, killing in some places one-third or so.\r\n\r\nIt is much easier to prevent their ravages in nurseries than in this\r\nlatter case, simply because the spot in which they must be sought and\r\ndestroyed is circumscribed in the one, almost unlimited in the other.\r\n\r\nOnly one thing can be done. Employ boys (they soon get clever enough\r\nat the work) to hunt for their holes and dig them out. The holes are\r\nminute, but run down a long way. The only plan to follow them is to\r\nput in a thin pliable stick and remove the soil along it. On getting\r\nto the bottom of the stick, if it is not the bottom of the hole, you\r\nrepeat the operation till you _do_ get to the bottom, and there you\r\nwill generally find the cricket.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning they can be often found and caught outside their\r\nholes. The boys employed should be paid for them by the number they\r\ncatch. They can be placed alive and brought to the factory in a hollow\r\nbamboo, and then killed in some merciful way.\r\n\r\nWhen once a Tea plant has got a stem as thick as a thick pencil no\r\ncricket can hurt it.\r\n\r\nThey are much worse in some places than others, and in my experience I\r\nhave found them worse on low lands.\r\n\r\nThe white ant is a much more formidable enemy than the cricket. They\r\n_do_ (as all planters know) attack and destroy living bushes.[28]\r\nWhether they first attack some small dead portion or not is a question,\r\nbut practically it does not signify the least, for if they do they\r\nmanage to find such in about one-third of the trees in a garden.\r\nBeginning with the minute dead part they kill ahead of them as they go,\r\nand will, eventually, in many cases, if left alone, kill the largest\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThey have a formidable enemy in the small black ant which exists in\r\nmyriads, and kills the white ant whenever the latter is not protected\r\nby the earthen tunnels he constructs. In many places so great is the\r\npest that, did this small black ant not exist, I believe no Tea Garden\r\ncould stand.\r\n\r\nFrom the close of the rains to the cold weather is the worst time for\r\nwhite ants, and the time the planter should guard particularly against\r\ntheir ravages. At that time if he examines his trees closely he will\r\nvery likely find white ants on a quarter of the whole.\r\n\r\nDigging round the plant where they are disturbs their runs and does\r\nmuch good. At the same time they should be brushed off any part of the\r\ntree they have attacked, and the tree should be well shaken.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, only does temporary good, for they often are found\r\nas thick as ever on the plant a week later.\r\n\r\nTobacco water is beneficial, but in wet weather it is soon washed off.\r\n\r\n\r\nKerosene oil is _very_ efficient. A little is put round the stem,\r\nbut it is expensive. The next best thing I know is the earth oil\r\n(petroleum) from Burmah, and this is cheap enough. It is thick, but\r\nused from a bottle it gets heated by the sun and is then quite limpid.\r\n\r\nWhen white ants are found on a tree, a little with a small brush is put\r\non the part they have attacked. They are also well shaken off, and a\r\nring of oil is placed round the stem. My experience is that they will\r\nnot attack that tree again for a long time. I was at first fearful that\r\nboth it and the kerosene (the one, I believe, is only a manufacture\r\nof the other) would injure the trees, but both are safe. I strongly\r\nrecommend others to try it, if they doubt, on a small spot only in the\r\nfirst instance.\r\n\r\nWhatever is used, or whatever is done, white ants must not be left to\r\nwork their will in the autumn. All the trees should then be examined\r\nonce at least, and once again, if possible, the following spring.\r\n\r\nBlight (a serious matter, I hear, in Cachar) I know but little of. I\r\ndo not remember hearing anything about it when I was there, now some\r\nfourteen years ago. It is rare in the Chittagong district, but I have\r\nseen one or two trees attacked with it. Under its influence the young\r\nleaves get covered with brown spots and shrivel. It is most destructive\r\nto the yield of a garden.\r\n\r\nFrom one or two experiments made I believe pruning off all the diseased\r\nbranches, and scraping back the soil for a space of 2 feet round the\r\nstem, so as almost to lay the roots bare, will be found beneficial, but\r\nI do not speak with certainty.\r\n\r\nAll the Himalayan gardens are free from these three pests detailed,\r\nexcept that occasionally a few crickets have been seen.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[28] A long controversy on this point lately took place in the papers;\r\nthat is to say, the point discussed was, whether white ants do or do\r\nnot attack living tea trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nFILLING UP VACANCIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo difficult is this to do, that I have heard several planters declare\r\nthey would attempt it no further, but, on the contrary, accept the\r\nvacancies in their gardens as an unavoidable evil.\r\n\r\nThat it is difficult I, too, can certify. Seedlings put into vacant\r\nspots year after year die, either in the rains they are planted or in\r\nthe following spring. If, however, a few yards off a fresh piece of\r\nland is taken in and planted, the plants live. What is the reason? It\r\ncan be nothing connected with the soil, for on adjacent spots they live\r\nand die.\r\n\r\nIt puzzled me a long time, but I _believe_ I can now explain it.\r\n_First_, seedlings planted in vacant spots in a garden are never\r\n_safe_. When in the rains there are many weeds in the gardens, and it\r\nis being dug, the young seedlings are not observed, are either dug up,\r\nor injured so by the soil being dug close to them, that they shortly\r\nafter die. This is, I believe, the _principal_ cause of the failure,\r\nand it may be in a great measure, if not entirely, obviated by putting,\r\n_first_, a high stake on either side of the seedling, and taking care\r\nit remains there all through the rains. _Secondly_, as an additional\r\nprecaution, and a very necessary one, before any such land is dug, send\r\nround boys with “koorpies” to clean away the jungle round the young\r\nplants, and at the same time open the soil slightly over their roots.\r\nDoing this “cultivates” them, and the plants being apparent, with the\r\nnewly-stirred vacant spaces round them, are seen by the diggers, and\r\nare not likely to be damaged.\r\n\r\nThe second cause of failure I attribute to the old plants on either\r\nside of the young seedling, taking to themselves all the moisture\r\nthere may be in the soil during any drought. The young seedling, whose\r\ntap-root at the time is not a long one (for it is in the spring of the\r\nyear following the year of planting that this occurs), is dependent\r\nfor life entirely on the small amount of moisture that exists in the\r\nsoil, at that insignificant depth (say 8 inches). But on two sides\r\nof the said seedling’s tap-root, and in fact surrounding it, if the\r\nneighbouring Tea bushes are full grown, are the feeding rootlets of the\r\nbig plants, sucking up all the moisture attainable (the necessities of\r\n_all_ plants being then great), and leaving none for the poor young\r\nseedling, which consequently dies in the unequal contest.\r\n\r\nThis last evil (in climates where there is a deficiency of spring\r\nrains, and, in fact, more or less in all Tea localities, for in none\r\nis there as much rain as the plants require in the spring) there is\r\nno means of avoiding as long as seedlings, after transplanting, _lose\r\ntime_, the effect of the transplanting, and thus fail to attain a good\r\ndepth before the said dry season.\r\n\r\nIn fact, unless something is devised, I believe with many, trying to\r\nfill up vacancies is a loss of time and money.\r\n\r\nThe pits to plant in, advised at page 59, should of course be made in\r\nthese vacant spots, for they help much towards the early descent of the\r\ntap-root. Still they can scarcely avail sufficiently to avoid the evil,\r\nif the plant is lying inert, as is generally the case for two or three\r\nmonths after planting; this delay being, moreover, in the rains, the\r\nbest growing time.\r\n\r\nIf we can devise any means to avoid this delayed growth in the young\r\nseedling after it is transplanted, then the tap-root, before the\r\ndrought of next spring, will have descended low enough to gather\r\nmoisture for itself; that is, from _lower_ depth than the greater\r\nnumber of the rootlets of the neighbouring big plants traverse. Could\r\nthis be done, and if the means above detailed are resorted to, to\r\nprevent the young plants being injured when the gardens are dug, I see\r\nno reason why vacancies should not be successfully filled up. Then\r\nmight be seen, what nowhere can be seen now, a Tea garden full of\r\nplants, that is, with _no_ vacancies.\r\n\r\nWhen it is considered that many gardens in all the districts have 30 or\r\neven 40 per cent. vacancies, none less than say 12 per cent., we may\r\nstrike a fair average and roughly compute the vacancies in Tea gardens\r\nthroughout the country at 20 per cent. In other words, the yield of\r\nTea from India, with the _same_ expenditure now incurred, would be\r\none-fifth more were plantations full!\r\n\r\nI have shown how the first evil can be obviated. I _think_ the\r\nfollowing will obviate the second.\r\n\r\nGet earthen pots made 7-1/2 inches diameter at the head and 7-1/2\r\ninches deep, like the commonest flower pots, only these should be\r\nnearly as wide at the bottom as at the top. A circular hole, 2 inches\r\ndiameter, must be left in the bottom. Fill these with mould of the same\r\n_nature_ as the soil of the garden where the vacancies exist. Put two\r\nor three seeds in each, all near the centre, and not more than half an\r\ninch below the surface. Place these pots, so filled, near water, and\r\nbeneath artificial shade, as described in Chapter XIII.\r\n\r\nWhen the seeds have germinated, and the seedlings have two or three\r\nleaves, so that you can judge which is the best class of seedlings in\r\neach pot,[29] root out all but one, the best one. Now remove the shade\r\ngradually, water from time to time, and let the seedlings grow in the\r\npots till the rains. Having, before the rains, made the holes at the\r\nvacancies as before described, after the first fall carry the pots to\r\nthe garden and place each one near a hole.\r\n\r\nThen plant as follows. Stand the pot on the brink of the hole, having\r\npreviously with a hammer broken the bottom. Then crack the sides also\r\ngently, and deposit pot and all in the hole at the proper depth. If\r\nnot enough broken, the sides of the pot may now be further detached,\r\nnay, even partially removed. Now fill up with earth to the top. Pieces\r\nof the pot left in the hole will do no harm; but it, the pot, must\r\nbe sufficiently broken at the bottom to allow of the free descent of\r\nthe tap-root, as also enough broken at the sides to allow of the free\r\nspreading of the rootlets.\r\n\r\nIf all this has been carefully done, so that the mould in the pot shall\r\nnot have been shaken free of the rootlets, the seedlings will not even\r\n_know_ it has been transplanted. Its growth will not be delayed for a\r\nday, instead of two or three months; and by the time the dry season\r\ncomes, the tap-root will have descended far enough to imbibe moisture.\r\n\r\nAnother plan to effect the same object. Instead of pots, use coarse\r\nbamboo open wicker-work baskets. The split bamboo forming the said\r\nwicker-work about half an inch wide, the interstices about one quarter\r\nof an inch square. Let the diameter of the basket be the same at top\r\nand bottom, viz., 9 inches; the depth of the basket 10 inches.\r\n\r\nWhen the seedlings in the nursery are large enough to enable you\r\nto select a good class of plant, transplant one into each basket\r\npreviously filled with soil.[30] This being done when the plants are\r\nvery young, and there being _then_ no difficulty in taking them up\r\nwith earth attached to their short tap-roots and rootlets, they will\r\nscarcely be thrown back at all. Being near water they can also be well\r\ntended. Put basket and all into the vacant hole at the beginning of the\r\nrains, and fill up as directed for the pots. The interstices will allow\r\nthe feeding rootlets to pass through, besides the basket rots quickly\r\nunder ground, so quickly it cannot impede the plant.\r\n\r\nSeed is not sown at once in the baskets as in the pots, because the\r\nbaskets would not last so long. Even putting the seedling in it during\r\n(say) February, the basket, with the occasional watering necessary,\r\nwill, more or less, have rotted before it is put into the hole.\r\n\r\nI have concluded a contract for ten thousand pots and five thousand\r\nbaskets at half an anna each for both kinds. Two pice, to ensure the\r\nfilling up of a vacancy, is not a large outlay.\r\n\r\nSince writing the above I have had experience of both the above plans.\r\nThe pot system is far the better, and answers very well.[31] I am\r\nnow trying to improve this still further by making the pots a little\r\nlarger, and placing a thin inner lining of tin inside each about half\r\nan inch from the sides. This space is first filled with sand, then the\r\npot is filled with mould, and the tin pulled out. The same tin will\r\ntherefore do for any number of pots. The seed is then put in.\r\n\r\nI think by this plan if, when about to plant, the mould in the pot is\r\nwell wetted, that it, with the seedling, can be turned out whole in one\r\npiece, and then put in the hole _without_ the pot.\r\n\r\nThe same pots would then answer year after year, and the expense would\r\nbe quite nominal.\r\n\r\nIf well done, the seedling in this, as in the former case, would not\r\neven _know_ it had been transplanted.[32]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] By “best class” I mean the most indigenous class.\r\n\r\n[30] Mind again this be of the same nature as the garden soil.\r\n\r\n[31] The baskets are too frail; being often wetted, they fall to pieces\r\nbefore the planting time.\r\n\r\n[32] It may be that the transplanting and transporting tools invented\r\nby Mr. Jeben (see page 79) will solve the difficulty of filling up\r\nvacancies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nFLUSHING AND NUMBER OF FLUSHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tea plant is said to flush when it throws out new shoots and\r\nleaves. The young leaves thus produced are the only ones fit to make\r\nTea, and the yield of a plantation depends therefore entirely on the\r\nfrequency and abundance of the flushes.\r\n\r\nThe way a flush is formed is fully explained under the head of “leaf\r\npicking” (pages 103, 104, and 107).\r\n\r\nThe number of flushes in different plantations varies enormously,\r\nowing, _first_, to climate; _secondly_, to soil; _thirdly_, to the\r\npruning adopted; _fourthly_, to the degree of cultivation given; and\r\n_fifthly_, though not least, to the presence or absence of manure.\r\n\r\nHow to secure all these advantages to their fullest extent is shown\r\nunder those heads, and we have here only to consider what is a low, a\r\nmedium, and a high rate of flushing per season.\r\n\r\nIn doing this we must speak of elevated (as Himalayan) gardens\r\nseparately. The cool climate of heights makes it impossible for Tea to\r\nflush there as on the plains.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally of elevated gardens (the higher they are the\r\nshorter the period, and _vice versâ_), seven months may be considered\r\nas the average producing period, viz., from beginning of April to end\r\nof October, and during that time twelve to fifteen flushes may be\r\nobtained, which, I believe, with high cultivation and liberal manuring,\r\ncan be increased to eighteen.\r\n\r\nIn all localities, with favourable Tea climates, the plants flush\r\nboth for a longer period and oftener. Speaking generally also, in this\r\ncase, of the five best localities, viz., Assam, Cachar, Chittagong,\r\nthe Terai below Darjeeling, and the Western Dooars (for even in these\r\ndistricts many advantages exist in one garden which do not in another),\r\nthe following is an approximation to the flushing periods:--\r\n\r\n_Upper Assam._--February 25th to November 15th.\r\n\r\n_Lower Assam._--February 20th to November 20th.\r\n\r\n_Cachar._--February 20th to November 20th.\r\n\r\n_Chittagong._--March 10th to December 20th.\r\n\r\n_Terai below Darjeeling and Western Dooars._--March 1st to November\r\n20th.\r\n\r\nThe opening period is a little late in Upper Assam on account of the\r\ncold, and closes a little earlier for the same reason.\r\n\r\nLower Assam and Cachar are much alike.\r\n\r\nThe opening in Chittagong is later than in the two just mentioned from\r\nwant of early rains, but the season continues longer on account of the\r\nlow latitude and consequent deferred cold weather.\r\n\r\nRoughly, then, rather more than nine months may be assumed as the\r\nflushing period for these districts. The next point is how _often_ do\r\ngardens in these localities flush in that time.\r\n\r\nNot very many planters can say, certainly, how often their gardens have\r\nflushed in a season, because they are picked so irregularly, and no\r\naccount of the different flushes kept. Enquiring on this point, when\r\nI was in Cachar some thirteen years ago, 9 to 24 were the minimum and\r\nmaximum numbers given me at different gardens, showing how little was\r\nreally known about it.\r\n\r\nSuch knowledge as I have on the subject is mostly derived from\r\ncarefully kept records of my own garden in the Chittagong district. The\r\nplantation is all worked in sections, in the way described previously,\r\nand the dates given in the table below are the days each flush was\r\nfinished (that is, the picking was finished) during the seasons 1869\r\nand 1870; 1869 being carried up to the end of the season, 1870 up to\r\nthe date I wrote the first edition of this Essay.\r\n\r\nIn the table it will be observed there is a great difference between\r\nthe two years. The section for which the dates are given was planted\r\nfrom seed beds in the month of June, 1866. In 1869 it was therefore\r\nonly three years old. This will partly account for the first flush\r\noccurring a month earlier in 1870, as it was then a year older; but\r\nfortunate early rains in 1870 had also much to do with it.\r\n\r\n  --------+-------------+----------+-------------+-------------\r\n          |    1869     | Interval |    1870     | Interval\r\n  Flushes +-------------+ in days  +-------------+ in days\r\n          |    Dates    |          |    Dates    |\r\n  --------+-------------+----------+-------------+-------------\r\n     1    | March    22 |    ..    | February 22 |    ..\r\n     2    | May       6 |    44    | March    30 |    35\r\n     3    | „        29 |    23    | April    13 |    10\r\n     4    | June     11 |    12    | „        25 |    12\r\n     5    | „        23 |    12    | May       5 |     9\r\n     6    | July      5 |    11    | „        14 |     9\r\n     7    | „        17 |    12    | „        25 |    11\r\n     8    | „        31 |    14    | June      4 |     9\r\n     9    | August   10 |     9    | „        12 |     8\r\n    10    | „        21 |    11    | „        22 |    10\r\n    11    | Sept.     2 |    11    | July      1 |     8\r\n    12    | „        12 |    10    | „         8 |     7\r\n    13    | „        25 |    13    | „        16 |     8\r\n    14    | October   9 |    13    | „        25 |     9\r\n    15    | „        22 |    13    | August    2 |     7\r\n    16    | Nov.      2 |    10    | „        11 |     9\r\n    17    | „        11 |     9    | „        21 |    10\r\n    18    | „        19 |     8    | „        29 |     8\r\n    19    | Dec.      4 |    14    | Sept      7 |     8\r\n    20    |      ..     |    ..    | „        18 |    11\r\n    21    |      ..     |    ..    | „        27 |     9\r\n    22    |      ..     |    ..    | October   5 |     7\r\n  --------+-------------+----------+-------------+-------------\r\n    Average intervals   | Nearly 14|             |Very little\r\n    between Flushes.    |  days.   |      ..     |over 10 days.\r\n  ----------------------+----------+-------------+-------------\r\n\r\nIn 1869 there was no flush between March 22nd and May 6th, a period of\r\n44 days; and in 1870, none between February 22nd and March 30th, a\r\nperiod of 35 days, a very long time in both cases, which is entirely\r\naccounted for by the dry weather prevailing at Chittagong in the spring\r\n(see under head of Climate), for in Cachar, Assam, and the Western\r\nDooars two or three flushes would have occurred in that time.\r\n\r\nThere were 19 flushes in all in 1869, and 22 in 1870, up to the time I\r\nwrote, so there were probably in all 27 in the latter year.\r\n\r\nIn the table I give the intervals between each flush. It shows an\r\naverage of 14 days in 1869 to 10 days in 1870; the difference is due to\r\nthe increased age of the plants, and the liberal manuring given in the\r\ncold weather 1869-70.\r\n\r\nSuch a result as is shown for 1870, and the probable result of 27\r\nflushes to the end of that season, could not be obtained without high\r\ncultivation and liberal manuring. The land in question had been manured\r\nevery year since it was planted, but an extra dose was given in the\r\ncold weather of 1869-70. The ground was therefore very rich.\r\n\r\nI think, therefore, 25 flushes in the season may be looked for on\r\ngardens in good Tea climates, when high cultivation and liberal\r\nmanuring are resorted to. Where manure cannot be obtained, I think,\r\neven if in other respects the land is highly cultivated, more than 22\r\nflushes will not be obtained. Where neither manure nor high cultivation\r\nis given, above 18 flushes will not be got.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a general idea with planters (see diagram, page 104)\r\nthat when a flush is picked the succeeding flush, at an interval of say\r\nseven to ten days, consists of shoots from the axis of the leaf down\r\nto which the previous flush was picked. Thus in the diagram, supposing\r\nthe shoot to be picked down to the black line above 2, the idea is the\r\nnext flush will be a shoot springing from the same place, viz., the\r\naxis of leaf _d_. But it is _not_ so. In the above case it will take a\r\nwhole month, after the said shoot has been picked, before the new shoot\r\nfrom the base of the leaf _d_ is ready to take, probably six weeks in\r\nHimalayan gardens.\r\n\r\n’Tis true the flushes in favourable Tea climates follow at about\r\nseven to ten days from each other, but these are _other_ shoots. The\r\nreplacement of the actual shoot taken is a whole month in developing.\r\nI have carefully watched this, and am sure I am right.\r\n\r\nWith similar treatment, gardens in Cachar, Assam, and the Western\r\nDooars would probably give two or three more flushes in the season than\r\nChittagong, because there the spring rains are much more abundant; and\r\nI am very certain that, if the day ever comes that manure in large\r\nquantities is procurable in those districts and is applied, the yield\r\non those gardens will be very large.[33]\r\n\r\nThe difference between very small and very large profits is represented\r\nby 18 and 25 flushes, so I strongly advise all planters to cultivate\r\nhighly, and to get all the manure they possibly can. If even procured\r\nat a high figure, it (the manure) will pay hand over hand.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[33] Where new gardens are made on rich virgin soil, to manure them at\r\nall for the first few years is, I think, unnecessary. But the richest\r\nsoils on Tea gardens get exhausted in time, and manure should be\r\napplied _before_ this point is arrived at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nLEAF PICKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first consideration is how to get the largest quantity of leaf\r\nwithout injuring the trees.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent, it is true that the more a Tea bush is pruned and\r\npicked the more it will yield. It appears as if Nature were always\r\ntrying to repair the violence done to the tree by giving new mouths or\r\nleaves to breathe with in place of those taken away. I may exemplify my\r\nmeaning in another way. A Tea bush which has as many leaves on it as\r\n_it requires_ will throw out tardily new shoots, and their number will\r\nbe small. In other words, a plant which is not pruned, and from which\r\nthe young leaves are not taken, grows gradually large and bushy, and\r\nthen gives up flushing altogether. It has all the leaves it _requires_,\r\nand it has no necessity to throw out more.\r\n\r\nIf, however, Nature is too much tried, that is, if too much violence\r\nis done to her, she sulks and will exert herself no more. Up to this\r\npoint, therefore, it is well to urge her. How can we know when we have\r\nreached it?\r\n\r\nOnly general rules can be laid down. Experience is the great\r\n_desideratum_ on this and many other subjects connected with Tea.[34]\r\n\r\nIf the plant can always be kept in such a state that the foliage,\r\nwithout being _very much so_, is still less than Nature requires, I\r\nconceive the object will be attained.\r\n\r\nThe greatest violence is done to the plant when it is pruned, and\r\nreason would seem to argue that when this violence is repairing, that\r\nis, when the first shoots in the spring show themselves, and until\r\nnew mouths (or leaves) in sufficient quantities exist, until then but\r\nlittle leaf should be picked.\r\n\r\nFortunately, moreover, while in the interests of the plant this is the\r\nbest plan, it also is the mode by which the largest yield of leaf will\r\nbe secured in the season. I go to show this.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary size of a good full-grown Tea plant, at the end of the\r\nseason, is, say, 3-1/2 or 4 feet high, and 5 feet diameter. It is\r\npruned down, say, to a height of 2 feet, with a diameter of 3 feet.\r\nIt is then little more than wooden stems and branches, and to anyone\r\nignorant of the _modus operandi_ in Tea gardens, it would appear as\r\nif a plantation so pruned has been ruined. The tree remains so during\r\nall its hybernating period, that is, during the time it is resting and\r\nthe sap is down (this period is longer or shorter, as the climate is\r\na warm or cold one, and it is always during the coldest season), but\r\non the return of spring new shoots start out from the woody stems and\r\nbranches in the following way:--At the axis or base of each leaf is a\r\nbud, the germ of future branches, these develop little by little, until\r\na new shoot is formed of, say, five or six leaves, with a closed bud at\r\ntop. Then if it be not picked the said bud at top hardens. At the axis\r\nor base of each of the said five or six leaves are other buds, and the\r\nnext step is for one, two, or three of these to develop in the same way\r\nand form new shoots. The original shoot grows thicker and higher until\r\nit becomes a wooden branch or stem. The same process, in their turn,\r\nis repeated with the new shoots. A diagram (see next page) will make\r\nmy meaning clear. We here have a shoot fully developed, of six leaves,\r\ncounting the close leaf _a_ at top as one, viz., the leaves _a_, _b_,\r\n_c_, _d_, _e_, _f_. The shoot has started and developed from what was\r\noriginally a bud at _K_, at the axis or base of the leaf _H_. In the\r\nsame way as formerly at _K_ a bud existed, which has now formed the\r\ncomplete shoot or flush _K a_, so at the base of the leaves _c_, _d_,\r\n_e_, _f_, exist buds 1, 2, 3, 4, from which later new shoots would\r\nspring. These again would all have buds at the base of the leaves,\r\ndestined to form further shoots, which again would be the parents of\r\nothers, and so on to the end of the season, or until the tree is pruned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt will readily be seen the increase is tremendous. It is only limited\r\nby the power of the soil to fling out new shoots, and the _necessities_\r\nof the plant, for, as I have explained, when as much foliage exists as\r\nthe plant requires, but few new shoots are produced.\r\n\r\nNow supposing the shoot in the diagram to be (with perhaps another not\r\nshown at _L_) the first on the branch _I I_ in the spring (the said\r\nbranch having been cut off or pruned at the upper _I_). It is then\r\nevident the said shoot is destined to be the parent and producer of all\r\nthe very numerous branches and innumerable shoots into which the plant\r\nwill extend in that direction. It is, in other words, the goose which\r\nwill lay all the future eggs. If, eager to begin Tea making early, the\r\nplanter nips it off, the extension on that part of the tree is thrown\r\nback many weeks. It may be taken off at 1, 2, or 3 (the back lines\r\ndrawn show the proper way to pick leaf); the least damage will be done\r\nif it is taken off at 1, the most at 3.\r\n\r\nThe said shoot _K a_ is the first effort of Nature to repair the\r\nviolence done to the tree by pruning. It is the germ of many other\r\nbranches and shoots, and it ought _never_ to be taken. I have, I hope,\r\nmade so much plain.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another consideration. Any shoot, left to fully\r\ndevelop and harden, does not throw out new shoots from the existing\r\nbuds 1, 2, 3, 4 so quickly as one checked in its upward growth\r\nby nipping off its head. For instance, supposing the shoot under\r\nconsideration _not_ to be the first of the season, but on the contrary\r\nto be a shoot when the plant has developed sufficiently to make picking\r\nsafe, if taken off at 2, then the new growth from 2, 3, 4 will be much\r\nquicker than it would be had the whole shoot been left intact.\r\n\r\nOur object then with _first_ shoots should be to secure this advantage\r\nwithout destroying any buds, and this we can do by taking off simply\r\nthe closed leaf at the top _a_. This must be done so as not to injure\r\nthe bud at the base of the second leaf _b_ (I have not numbered it, for\r\nthere is no room in the diagram to do so), and we shall thus leave all\r\nthe buds on the shoot intact.\r\n\r\nAgain here the interests of the plant, and profit to the planter,\r\ngo hand in hand. The closed bud _a_ in this case will be found very\r\nvaluable. I go to show this.\r\n\r\nThe value of Tea is increased when it shows “Pekoe tips.” Only the\r\nleaves _a b_ make these. They are covered with a fine silky whitish\r\ndown, and, if manufactured in a particular way, make literally white\r\nor very pale yellow Tea,[35] which, mixed with ordinary black Tea, show\r\nas “Pekoe tips.” In ordinary leaf-picking these two leaves are taken\r\nwith all the others, but unfortunately, when manufactured with them,\r\nthey lose this white or pale yellow colour, and come out as black as\r\nall the other Tea.\r\n\r\nAs the season goes on, this is less and less the case, till towards\r\nthe end nearly all the _a b_ leaves show orange-coloured in the\r\nmanufactured Tea. Still they are not _white_ (the best colour) as they\r\ncan be made when treated separately. No means have yet been devised\r\nto separate them _before_ manufacture from the other leaf, and though\r\nsometimes picked separate, the plan has serious objections (see next\r\npage). In the case, however, of the first two or three flushes the\r\nwelfare of the plants demands that no more should be taken, and though\r\nthe quantity obtained will be small, it will, if carefully manufactured\r\nso as to make “white Pekoe tips,” add one or two annas a lb. to the\r\nvalue, when mixed with it, of one hundred times its own weight of black\r\nTea!\r\n\r\nMore will be found under this head in the Tea manufacturing part. I\r\nnow beg the question that the said downy leaves taken alone are very\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nIn detailing the mode of picking I advocate, it would be tedious to go\r\nminutely into the reasons for each and everything. I have said enough\r\nto explain a good deal, but will add anything of importance. Of the\r\nlatter are the following.\r\n\r\nTea can be made of the young succulent leaves only. The younger and\r\nmore succulent the leaf the better Tea it makes. Thus _a_ will make\r\nmore valuable Tea than _b_, _b_ than _c_, and so on; _e_ is the lowest\r\nleaf to make Tea from, for though a very coarse kind can be made from\r\n_f_, it does not pay to take it. The stalk also makes good Tea, as far\r\nas it is really succulent, that is, down to the black line just above\r\n2.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are named as follows from the Teas it is supposed they would\r\nmake:--\r\n\r\n  _a._--Flowery Pekoe.\r\n  _b._--Orange Pekoe.\r\n  _c._--Pekoe.\r\n  _d._--Souchong, 1st.\r\n  _e._--  „       2nd.\r\n  _f._--Congou.\r\n\r\n                 _a_, _b_, _c_--Pekoe.\r\n  Mixed together\r\n                 _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_--Pekoe Souchong.\r\n\r\nIf there be another leaf below _f_, and it be taken, it is named, and\r\nwould make Bohea.\r\n\r\nEach of these leaves was at first a flowery Pekoe leaf (_a_), it then\r\nbecame _b_, then _c_, and so on.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, as the shoot developed, and a new flowery Pekoe leaf\r\nwas born, each of the leaves below assumed the next lowest grade.\r\n\r\nCould the leaves fit to make each kind of Tea it is proposed to make\r\nbe picked and kept separate, and each be manufactured in the way most\r\nsuitable to its age, and the Tea to be produced, the very best of every\r\nkind could easily be manufactured. But this cannot be; the price of\r\nTea will not allow it, and the labour to do it would moreover fail. It\r\nhas been attempted again and again to do it, partly to the extent of\r\ntaking the Pekoe leaves _a_, _b_, _c_ separate from the others (for\r\nthe manufacture best suited to these upper leaves is not suited to the\r\nlower), but it has been as often abandoned, and I doubt if it is now\r\npractised anywhere. I am sure it will never pay to do it.\r\n\r\nPicking leaf is a coarse operation. It is performed by 80 or 100 women\r\nand children together, and it is impossible to follow each, and see\r\nit is done the best way. They must be taught, checked, and punished\r\nif they do wrong, and then it will be done more or less right; but\r\nperfection is not attainable.\r\n\r\nI advise the following plan in picking. Please refer to the diagram:--\r\n\r\nIf the garden has been severely pruned (as it ought to be) take only\r\nthe bud _a_ for _two_ flushes; then for _two_ more nip the stalk above\r\n1, taking the upper part of leaf _c_, as shown (done with one motion of\r\nthe fingers). But from the fifth flush take off the shoot at the line\r\nabove 2, and by a separate motion of the fingers take off the part of\r\nleaf _e_ where the black line is drawn. By this plan, when the rains\r\nbegin, the trees will show a large picking surface, for plenty of buds\r\nwill have been preserved for new growth. After the month of August\r\nyou may pick lower if you like, as you cannot hurt the trees. For\r\ninstance, you may nip the stalk and upper part of leaf _e_ together,\r\nand separately the upper part of _f_.\r\n\r\nThe principle of picking is to leave the bud at the axis of the leaf\r\ndown to which you pick intact.\r\n\r\nSome planters pick all through the season at the line above 1, and take\r\nthe _d_ and perhaps the _e_ leaf separately. I do not like the plan,\r\nfor though it will make strong Teas, the yield will be small. Moreover,\r\nthe plants will form so much foliage; they will not flush well; and\r\nagain, they will grow so high that boys who pick will not readily reach\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\nShortly, the principle I advocate is to prune severely, so that the\r\nplant in self-defence _must_ throw out many new shoots; to be sparing\r\nand tender with these until the violence done to the tree is in a\r\nmeasure, but not quite, repaired; then, till September, to pick so much\r\nthat the wants of the plant in foliage are never quite attained; and\r\nafter September to take all you can get.\r\n\r\nI believe this principle (for the detailed directions given may be\r\nvaried, as for instance when trees have _not_ been heavily pruned)\r\nwill give the largest yield of leaf, and will certainly not injure the\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34] See foot-note, page 86, which shows that for 18 months after\r\ntransplanting, young bushes should not be pruned or picked at all.\r\n\r\n[35] I mean manufactured Tea. The infusion is called liquor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURE. MECHANICAL CONTRIVANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo manufacture your leaf into good Tea is certainly one of the first\r\nconditions for success. It will avail little to have a good productive\r\ngarden if you make inferior Tea. The difference of price between well\r\nand ill-manufactured Tea is great, say 4 as. or 6d. a lb., and this\r\nalone will, during a season, represent a large profit or none.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Tea enterprise, the more manufacture is studied the\r\nmore does it appear that to make good Tea is a very simple process. The\r\nmany operations or processes formerly considered necessary are now much\r\nreduced on all gardens. As there was then, that is formerly, so there\r\nis now, no _one_ routine recognized by all, or even by the majority;\r\nstill simplicity in manufacture is more and more making its way\r\neverywhere; and as the real fact is that to make the best Tea, but very\r\nfew, and very simple, processes are necessary, it is only a question of\r\ntime ere the fact shall be universally recognised and followed out.\r\n\r\nFor instance, panning the “roll”[36] was formerly universally\r\npractised. Some panned once, some twice, some even three times! But,\r\nto-day, pans are not used in most gardens at all!! Other processes,\r\nor rather in most cases the repetition of them, have been also either\r\ndiscarded or abridged. But a short statement of manufacture in old\r\ndays, and the simplest mode of manufacture, will best illustrate my\r\nmeaning:--\r\n\r\n  -----+--------------------------------+----------------------------------\r\n       |    One and a common old plan   |One plan to-day by which the best\r\n       |                                |         Tea can be made\r\n  -----+----------+---------------------+-----+----------+-----------------\r\n       |  Number  |                     |     |  Number  |\r\n  Days |    of    |    Detail           |Days |    of    |   Detail\r\n       |operations|                     |     |operations|\r\n  -----+----------+---------------------+-----+----------+-----------------\r\n  1st  |     1    |Withering.           |1st  |    1     |Withering.\r\n      {|     2    |1st Rolling.         |    {|    2     |Rolling.\r\n      {|     3    |2nd  „               |2nd {|    3     |Fermenting.\r\n      {|     4    |Fermenting.          |    {|    4     |Sunning (if sun).\r\n      {|     5    |1st Panning.         |    {|    5     |Firing (Dholing).\r\n  2nd {|     6    |3rd Rolling.         |     |          |\r\n      {|     7    |2nd Panning.         |     |          |\r\n      {|     8    |4th Rolling          |     |          |\r\n      {|     9    |Sunning.             |     |          |\r\n      {|    10    |1st Firing (Dholing).|     |          |\r\n      {|    11    |Cooling and crisping.|     |          |\r\n  3rd  |    12    |2nd Firing (Dholing).|     |          |\r\n  -----+----------+---------------------+-----+----------+-----------------\r\n    3  |    12    |  Total days and     |  2  |    5     | Total days and\r\n       |          |    operations.      |     |          |   operations.\r\n  -----+----------+---------------------+-----+----------+-----------------\r\n\r\nSo much for simplicity, and I affirm that no more than the five\r\noperations detailed are necessary. I shall try to show this further on.\r\n\r\nIn studying Tea manufacture I first tried, in order to get reliable\r\ndata to go on, to ascertain the effect of each and every operation,\r\nand not only that, but the effect on the made Tea of each operation\r\nexaggerated and diminished. It would be tedious, and of no use, to set\r\nout in detail all the experiments I conducted, the results only I will\r\ntry to give.\r\n\r\nI began at the beginning. Why wither at all? I made Tea (following out\r\nin each case all the other processes detailed in the old plan) of 1st,\r\ntotally unwithered leaves; 2nd, of leaves but little withered; 3rd, of\r\nleaves medium-withered; and 4th, of leaves over-withered.\r\n\r\nI arrived at the following results:--Unwithered or under-withered\r\nleaves break in the rolling and give out large quantities of a light\r\ngreen coloured juice during the same process. The Tea is much broken\r\nand of a reddish grey colour. The liquor is very pale in colour,\r\ncloudy, weak, soft, and tasteless.\r\n\r\nOver-withered leaf on the other hand takes a good twist in the rolling,\r\ngives out but little juice, which is of a thick kind, and of reddish\r\nyellow colour. The tea is well twisted, “chubby” in appearance, and\r\nblacker than ordinary. The liquor of an ordinary depth of colour,\r\nclear, with a mawkish taste.\r\n\r\nThe medium-withered leaves make good Tea, but I found the withering\r\nshould be rather in excess of what is generally done to ensure\r\nstrength. I will show later to what extent I think leaf should be\r\nwithered.\r\n\r\nThe next point was rolling. I knew some planters rolled the leaf hard,\r\nothers lightly. That is, some rolled with force till much juice was\r\nexpressed, others with a light hand, allowing little or no juice to be\r\npressed out. Which was the better?\r\n\r\nAfter many experiments I arrived at the following:--Hard rolling gives\r\ndarker coloured and stronger liquor than light rolling. Hard rolling\r\ndestroys Pekoe tips,[37] inasmuch as the juice expressed stains them\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nLight rolled Tea has therefore many more Pekoe tips than hard rolled.\r\n\r\nHard rolled Tea is somewhat blacker than light rolled.\r\n\r\nIn all, therefore, but the point of Pekoe tips hard rolling is better.\r\n\r\nThe next question was, what is the advantage of repeated rolling? I\r\nrolled twice, panning once between, _vide_ old plan, and found the Tea\r\nas well made and as strong as that rolled three or four times. I then\r\ndecided to roll _no more_ than twice. The second time was, I _then_\r\nthought, necessary, as I found the leaf of the roll opened in the pan,\r\nand a second rolling was requisite to twist it again.\r\n\r\nBut what did panning do? I heard pans had been discontinued in some\r\ngardens. In what way was panning an advantage? I made Tea, fermenting\r\nit between the two rollings, but _not_ panning it, and it was\r\nequally good. I tried again and again, but never could detect that\r\npanning caused any difference to either the Tea, the liquor, or the\r\nout-turn.[38] In short, though I never found panning did any harm, I\r\nequally found it never did any good. Its use is, in fact, simply barren\r\nof _all_ results.\r\n\r\nI therefore dispensed with it. Having done so, why roll the second\r\ntime at all? I experimented, and found the second rolling as barren of\r\nresults as the panning.\r\n\r\nI had now got rid of operations 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 in the old plan. The\r\nnext was No. 9--“sunning.” I made Tea with and without it, and found as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nSunning between the fermenting and firing processes has no effect\r\nwhatever on the liquor or the out-turn, but it makes the Tea rather\r\nblacker, and as it drives off much of the moisture in the roll, the\r\nfiring process after it is shorter and does not consume so much\r\ncharcoal. What little effect therefore it has is good (for if not\r\ncontinued too long, it does not make the Tea too black) and it is\r\neconomical. I therefore decided on retaining it.[39]\r\n\r\nNext came the operations 10, 11, and 12, viz., “first firing, cooling\r\nand crisping, and second firing.” Where these are done (and they are\r\ndone in some gardens now) the usual thing is to _half-fire_ the roll\r\nthe same afternoon and evening it is made, then allow it to “cool and\r\ncrisp” all night, and finish the firing next day. I tried this plan,\r\nand also the plan I have now adopted, of doing the whole firing at one\r\ntime the same evening. I tried the experiment again and again, and\r\nalways found the Tea, the liquor, and the out-turn were the same in\r\nboth cases. In short, that the three operations did no more and no less\r\nthan the one. As the three entail extra labour and extra expense in\r\ncharcoal I abandoned them.\r\n\r\nI thus reduced the twelve operations detailed to five, and naturally by\r\nso doing much decreased the cost of manufacturing Tea. I in no way lay\r\nclaim to having devised this simplicity myself. Part had been done by\r\nothers before I even turned my attention to it, and I have done no more\r\nthan help with many to make the manufacture of Tea a simple process.\r\n\r\nI was now convinced that (though I had still much to learn regarding\r\nthe said five processes) success was comprised therein, and that to\r\nmultiply them could not avail.\r\n\r\nThe next consideration is--What are the qualities desired in Tea to\r\nenable it to command a good price at the public auctions either in\r\nCalcutta or London? The brokers in these cases judge of the Tea first,\r\nvalue it, and give their report and valuation to intending purchasers\r\nand sellers. From what appearances and qualities do they judge?\r\n\r\nThey judge from three things, _first_, the Tea; _secondly_, the liquor;\r\n_thirdly_, the out-turn.\r\n\r\n_The Tea._--The colour should be black, but not a dead black, rather a\r\ngreyish black with a gloss on it. No red leaf should be mixed with it,\r\nit should be all one colour. The Tea should be regular: that is, each\r\nleaf should be about the same length, and should have a uniform close\r\ntwist, in all but “broken Teas.” (These latter are called “broken”\r\n_because_ the leaf is more or less open and broken.) The Tea should\r\nalso be regular of _its kind_, that is, if Pekoe all Pekoe, if Congou\r\nall Congou; for any stray leaves in a Tea of another kind, if even of\r\na _better_ kind or class, will reduce its value. In the higher class\r\nof Teas, viz., Pekoes and broken Pekoes, the more Pekoe tips that are\r\npresent the higher, in consequence, will its price be.\r\n\r\n_The Liquor._--In taste this should be strong, rasping, and pungent,\r\nwith, in the case of Pekoes, a “Pekoe flavour.” There are other words\r\nused in the trade to particularise certain tastes, but the words\r\nthemselves would teach nothing. Tea tasting cannot be learnt from\r\nbooks. _If_ the liquor is well flavoured, as a rule, the darker it is\r\nin the cup the better. But to judge of Teas by the colour of the liquor\r\nalone is impossible, for some high-class Teas have naturally a very\r\npale liquor.\r\n\r\n_The Out-turn._--A good out-turn is generally indicative of a good Tea.\r\nIt should be all, or nearly all, one colour. No black (burnt) leaves\r\nshould appear in it. A greenish tinge in some of the leaves is not\r\nobjectionable, and is generally indicative of pungent liquor, but the\r\nprevailing colour should be that of a bright new penny.\r\n\r\nEvery planter should be more or less of a Tea-taster, and should taste\r\nhis Teas daily. After a time (particularly if he gets other Teas to\r\ntaste against his own) he will learn to recognise, at all events, a\r\ngood as against a bad Tea, a strong as against a weak Tea, &c. No Tea\r\nshould be put away with the rest until it has been tasted. It may be\r\nburnt or have other defects, not apparent till infused, and one day’s\r\nbad Tea will bring down considerably the value of a whole bin of good\r\nTea.\r\n\r\nThe fancy, amongst brokers and dealers, for “Pekoe tips,” in all Pekoe\r\nTeas, constitutes the _one_ great difficulty in Tea manufacture. If the\r\nleaves which give “Pekoe tips” (see page 106) are separated from the\r\nother leaves, and manufactured separately and differently, that is\r\nrolled _very_ little and _very_ lightly, not allowed to ferment at all,\r\nbut sunned at once after rolling, and, if there is sun enough, finished\r\nin the sun, otherwise by a very light and gradual heat--best placed\r\n_above_ the drawers in the Dhole-house; if this is done, I say, these\r\nwill come out perfect “Pekoe tips” of a white colour, which is the best.\r\n\r\nIf _not_ separated from the other leaf, but manufactured with it, the\r\nsap from the other leaves, expressed in the rolling, stains these said\r\nleaves, which are covered with a fine white silk down, and makes them\r\nblack like all the rest of the Tea; the whole of which is then valued\r\nlower _because_ there are no “Pekoe tips.”\r\n\r\nNow, in the latter case the “Pekoe tips” are there all the same, only\r\nthey don’t _show_. The Tea is really just as good, in fact a shade\r\n_better_, with black than with white or orange tips,[40] but it does\r\nnot sell so well, and as we cannot argue the brokers or dealers into\r\na rational view of the case, we must humour their fancy (they are\r\nvirtually our masters) and give them the Pekoe tips--_if we can_.\r\n\r\nHow are we to do it? The plan of picking these small leaves separately,\r\nin order to manufacture them separately, does not answer; it is too\r\nexpensive; it diminishes the yield of a garden, and labour for it\r\nfails. All this is shown at pages 107 and 130. Is there any other way?\r\n\r\nIt may be done during some periods of the season when there is not\r\nleaf enough on the garden to employ all the leaf-pickers, by setting a\r\nnumber of them to separate the said two leaves from the others _after_\r\nthe whole leaf is brought to the factory. This is expensive, but it\r\npays when there is labour to do it, for then the Teas can be made very\r\nshowy and rich with white Pekoe tips.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious planter, a Mr. McMeekin, in Cachar, invented a rolling\r\ntable with the object of separating the said leaves. It is constructed\r\nof battens, and while rolling the leaf on it, many of the small leaves\r\nfall through. The said table is now well known in Cachar, and is in use\r\nin several gardens. I have tried it and find that it in a great measure\r\nanswers its object, but the objection to it is that the leaf _must_ be\r\nrolled lightly, and lightly-rolled leaf, as observed, does not make\r\nstrong Tea.\r\n\r\nThe Pekoe tips may be, in a great measure, preserved by rolling _all_\r\nthe leaf lightly on a common table. But then again the Tea is weak, and\r\nthe plan will not give so many Pekoe tips as McMeekin’s table.\r\n\r\nIn short, in the present state of our knowledge, except by the hand\r\nprocess (a tedious and expensive one for separating the leaf), strong\r\nTeas and Pekoe tips are incompatible.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is just where it was, and will so remain until dealers\r\ngive up asking for Pekoe tips (not a likely thing), or till a machine\r\nis invented to separate quickly and cheaply the two said small leaves\r\nfrom the others _after_ they have been all picked together. That such a\r\nmachine is possible I am certain, and the inventor would confer a boon\r\non the Tea interest far beyond the inventor of any other machine, for\r\nall the other processes _can_ be done by hand without much expense,\r\nthis cannot.\r\n\r\nI may here notice such machines and contrivances as exist for\r\ncheapening the manufacture of Tea, or rather such as I know of.\r\n\r\nRolling-machines have for their object the doing away with hand labour\r\nentirely for rolling the leaf. Kinmond’s rolling-machine is first on\r\nthe list, for it is the best yet invented.[41]\r\n\r\nKinmond’s consists of two circular wooden discs, the upper one moving\r\non the lower, which is stationary, with an eccentric motion. The\r\nadjacent faces of the said discs are made rough by steps in the wood,\r\ncut in lines diverging from the centre to the circumference, and over\r\nthese rough faces is nailed coarse canvas.\r\n\r\nThe leaf is placed between the discs and rolled by the motion\r\ndescribed. The lower disc is arranged by means of weights running\r\nover pulleys, so that it shall press against the upper with any force\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nThe motive power, as designed by the inventor, is either manual,\r\nanimal, or steam.\r\n\r\nMr. Kinmond showed me this machine, just after he had invented it, at\r\nthe Assam Company’s Plantations in Assam, and I have since seen it\r\nworking by manual and steam power. With the former it is quite useless,\r\nfor by no arrangement can sufficient or regular force enough be\r\napplied. With the latter it does very well, and on a large garden which\r\nwill render the outlay for the machine and engine justifiable (the\r\nformer is, for such a simple machine, very expensive), it may probably\r\neventually prove an economy.\r\n\r\nNot having seen it under animal power, I can give no positive opinion\r\nas to how it would answer, but I see no reason why it should not do\r\nwell. I believe wind or water power might, on suitable sites, be easily\r\napplied to it, and they would certainly be the cheapest of any.\r\n\r\nAnother rolling-machine was invented by a Mr. Gibbon, and a good deal\r\nused in Cachar. I have never seen it.\r\n\r\nKinmond’s is, I believe, the best rolling-machine yet invented (though\r\nit is fair to state I know no other except by report), but I do not\r\nbelieve in any Tea rolling-machine superseding _entirely_ the necessity\r\nof hand-rolling.[42] A rolling-machine may be, and is, very useful to\r\nroll the leaves partly, that is, to break the cells, and bring the leaf\r\ninto that soft _mashy_ state that very little hand labour will finish\r\nit. No rolling-machine yet invented can, I think, do more than this,\r\nand it is, I think, doubtful if any will ever be invented that will do\r\nmore. Machines do not give the nice final twist which is obtained by\r\nthe hand. I was told lately that most of the gardens in Cachar that had\r\nmachines had dropped them and gone back to hand-rolling. I cannot help\r\nthinking this is a mistake. They should use both, the hand-rolling for\r\nthe final part alone. Very few rolling-men would then suffice, with the\r\naid of the machine, to manufacture a large quantity of leaf.\r\n\r\nI only know of one other Tea rolling-machine, which is Nelson’s. It\r\ndoes not profess to do more than _prepare_ the green leaf for rolling,\r\nwhich, as stated above, is, I think, all that any machine will ever do.\r\nI have never seen it working, but it appears simple, being nothing more\r\nthan a mangle. The leaf is placed in bags, and then compressed under\r\nrollers attached to a box, weighted with stones. The prospectus states,\r\nit will prepare 80 lbs. green leaf in fifteen minutes, and that one\r\nman can then finish as much of such prepared leaf in three minutes as\r\nwould occupy him twelve minutes if the same had not been prepared. I\r\nsee nothing unlikely in this. The machine, though inferior to Kinmond’s\r\nin its arrangement, _ought_ to be cheap enough to bring it within the\r\nreach of all.[43]\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of one of McMeekin’s inventions. His\r\nchest-of-drawers for firing Tea is, I think, superior to his batten\r\ntable. It is now so well known, and in such general use, that I\r\nshall describe it very shortly. It is nothing more than a low\r\nchest-of-drawers, or trays fitted in a frame one above the other, the\r\nbottom of each tray being fine iron wire, so that the heat of the\r\ncharcoal, in the masonry receptacle over which it is placed, ascends\r\nthrough all the drawers and thus dries or fires a large quantity of\r\n“roll” at the same time. By the old plan, a single wicker sieve was\r\ninserted inside a bamboo frame called a “dhole,” which was placed over\r\na charcoal fire made in a hole in the ground. On the sieve the roll was\r\nplaced, and all the heat, after passing through this _one_ sieve, was\r\nwasted. Mr. McMeekin’s idea was to economise this heat by passing it\r\nthrough several drawers.\r\n\r\nMost planters use these drawers, and there is no doubt in the space\r\nsaved, and the economy of heat: it is a great step in advance over the\r\nold barbarous method, where not only was the heat wasted after passing\r\nthrough _one_ sieve, but a great deal was lost through the basket work\r\nof the “dhole” itself.\r\n\r\nStill I do not advocate four, still less five drawers one above the\r\nother. I think the steam ascending from the lower drawers must, more\r\nor less, injure the roll in the upper ones. I confine myself to two,\r\nand even then in the top tray leave a small circular space vacant by\r\nwhich the steam from the lower drawer can escape. I utilize the heat\r\nthat escapes, partially, by placing “dhallas” in tiers above, with roll\r\nin them. These are supported by iron rods let into the wall, and are\r\nuseful not only for partly drying the roll, but also for withering leaf\r\nwhen there is no sun.\r\n\r\nSome planters have proposed to do away with charcoal altogether under\r\nMcMeekin’s drawers, supplying its place by hot air. The first point\r\nin considering this invention is the question whether the fumes of\r\ncharcoal, as some assert, _are_ necessary to make good Tea. If they\r\nare _not_ necessary (that is, if they produce no chemical effect on\r\nthe Tea, and therefore heat from wood devoid of smoke would do as\r\nwell) there can be no doubt such heat would be cheaper, and more under\r\ncommand, by this or some other plan. Are then the fumes of charcoal\r\nnecessary?\r\n\r\nI do not know that anyone can answer the query. I certainly cannot,\r\nfor I have never made Tea with any other agent than charcoal, and I\r\nhave never met with more than one planter who had. He said the Tea was\r\nnot good. Still it would, I think, require very careful and prolonged\r\nexperiments to establish the fact either way. Speaking theoretically,\r\nas it _appears_, the only effect of charcoal is to drive all the\r\nmoisture out of the roll and thus make it Tea, I cannot but believe\r\nother heat would do as well. It is, however, a question that only\r\nexperience can solve.[44]\r\n\r\nI have now (four years since the above was written, and at the time\r\nI am preparing the second edition of this essay) been for some time\r\nemployed on experiments with a view to settle the above question.\r\nWhether I shall be able to devise a simple apparatus to effect the\r\nmanufacture of Tea without charcoal is doubtful, but I can, I think,\r\nnow safely affirm that the fumes of charcoal are _not_ necessary to\r\nmake Tea. On this point I am myself quite satisfied. The advantages\r\nof making Tea with any fuel (wood, coal, or anything else) would be\r\nnumerous:--\r\n\r\n1.--Economy.\r\n\r\n2.--Absence of charcoal fumes.\r\n\r\n3.--Less chance of fire in Tea Houses.\r\n\r\n4.--Probably reduced temperature in Factories.\r\n\r\n5.--Great saving of labour.\r\n\r\n6.--Saving of fuel--for it takes much wood to make a given weight of\r\ncharcoal.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all the above, the wholesale destruction of forests that\r\nnow takes place in all Tea Districts, in order to supply the charcoal\r\nfor Tea, would be much lessened.[45]\r\n\r\nI have seen a machine advertised for packing Tea, that is to say, for\r\nso pressing it down that a large quantity shall go into a chest. I\r\nhave never seen the machine, and so cannot say how it works, but I do\r\nnot think such a machine at all necessary. By the mode of packing,\r\ndescribed at page 150, as much Tea as a chest will hold _with safety_\r\ncan be put into it. If more were forced in, the chest would probably\r\ncome to pieces in transit.\r\n\r\nI see a sifting machine is now being advertised--“Jackson’s sifting\r\nmachine.” I have seen drawings of it, but not the machine itself. In\r\nthe one respect, that it is much larger than anything used hitherto, it\r\nis more likely to succeed.\r\n\r\nThere is a machine for sifting and fanning Tea at one and the same\r\ntime. I know not who invented it. It is a simple winnowing machine\r\nwith sieves placed in front of the fan. By means of a rod and crank\r\nattached to the axle of the revolving fan the sieves are made to shake\r\nfrom side to side when the fanners are turned. The Tea is put into the\r\nupper sieve, a coarse one, and passing successively through finer ones,\r\nis thus sorted into different Teas. The open leaf at the same time is\r\nblown out by the fan.\r\n\r\nI purchased one, but I do not find it does the work well. Sifting Tea\r\nis a nice process, and I did not find it sorted the Teas with any\r\nnicety. I have taken out the sieves, and use it now only for fanning,\r\nwhich it does very well, though no better than an apparatus which could\r\nbe constructed at one-third the cost.\r\n\r\nI do not believe in _any_ present or future machine for sifting Tea,\r\ninasmuch as it is an operation which, to be well done, has to be\r\ncontinually varied. More will be said on this head further on.\r\n\r\nI have now detailed shortly all the Tea machines or contrivances I\r\nknow, or have heard of, and I think there is plenty of room yet for\r\ninventors.[46] The machine, as before observed, most to be desired is\r\none to separate the small Pekoe leaves from the others, ere the rolling\r\nof the leaf is commenced. If such a machine existed, it would much\r\nincrease the value of all Indian Teas, and if the Agricultural and\r\nHorticultural Society are inclined to offer a prize for any machine, it\r\nshould be this.\r\n\r\nAt the point where the separation should take place, the stalk is much\r\ntenderer than elsewhere, and this led me to think a blow or concussion\r\non the mass of green leaf might effect the object. I attached a bow by\r\nthe centre to an immovable board, placed at right angles to the plane\r\nof a table (like the back of a dressing table), and then, causing leaf\r\nto drop from above, subjected it to sharp strokes from the string\r\nof the bow. It effected the object partially, for many Pekoe ends\r\nwere detached, but it bruised and cut the other leaf too much also.\r\nI believe a revolving barrel, with blunt but thin narrow iron plates\r\ninside, which would strike the leaf placed within, as the barrel was\r\nturned, would perhaps answer. I give the above idea for what it is\r\nworth, for any inventive genius to improve on.\r\n\r\nAs it is impossible, as far as I can see, to construct any machine\r\nwhich should _cut_ the stalk _only_ in the right place, _ergo_, I\r\nbelieve some arrangement which would take advantage of the fact, that\r\nthe stalk is tenderer there than elsewhere, is the only one that could\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nNow to return to the manufacture of Tea. I will consider each of the\r\nfive operations detailed, which I believe are all that are necessary to\r\nmake good Tea, separately.\r\n\r\n_Withering._--There are several tests to show when leaf is withered.\r\nFresh leaf squeezed in the hand, held near the ear, crackles, but no\r\nsound should be heard from withered leaf. Again, fresh leaf, pressed\r\ntogether in the palm of the hand, when released, springs back to nearly\r\nits original bulk, but withered leaf, in like circumstances, retains\r\nthe shape into which it has been pressed. The stalk of withered leaf\r\nwill bend double without breaking, but fresh leaf stalks, if bent very\r\nlittle, break. Practice, though, soon gives a test superior to all\r\nthese, viz., the feel of the leaf. Properly withered leaves are like\r\nold rags to lay hold of, and no further test, after a time, than the\r\nfeel of the leaf is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe agents for withering leaf are sun, light, heat, and air. Of these\r\nthe most powerful is sun, for it combines all the others with it. Light\r\nis a powerful agent, for if some leaf be placed in a partially dark\r\nroom, and some in a well-lighted verandah, the latter will wither in\r\nhalf the time the former will take. If light and moderate ventilation\r\nbe present, heat is a rapid accessory to rapid withering.\r\n\r\nThere is often great difficulty in withering leaf in the rain. It\r\n_can_ be withered in Tea pans, but “the out-turn” is then more or less\r\ninjured, for after infusion the out-turn comes out green instead of the\r\nproper “new penny” colour. Withering in dholes is also objectionable\r\nfor the same reason, though if the heat is moderate the green effect is\r\nless. It is further a long and tedious operation.\r\n\r\nSpace and light are the great wants for withering leaf in wet weather.\r\nBamboo mechans, tier above tier, should be constructed in every\r\navailable space. Large frames, covered with wire mesh, may also be made\r\n(by means of weights running over pulleys) to run up to the roof of any\r\nTea building. The leaf withers well in such frames, for heat ascends,\r\nand much heat is given out by dholes.\r\n\r\nIt signifies not though where leaf is spread as long as there is space\r\nand light. Houses made of iron and glass would be far the best for\r\nwithering leaf, for, if well ventilated, all the necessary agents for\r\nwithering, detailed in the last page, would be present. I do not doubt\r\nthe day will come when these will be used, for properly withered leaf\r\nis a necessity for good Tea.[47]\r\n\r\nIn dry weather, when leaf comes in from the garden, spread it thinly\r\nanywhere and turn it once early in the night. It will generally be\r\nwithered and ready to roll next morning. If not quite ready, then put\r\nit outside in the sun. Half an hour’s sunning will probably finish it.\r\n\r\nIn wet weather, if there is any sun when it comes in, or any time that\r\nday, take advantage of the sun to wither the leaf _partly_, so much\r\nthat, with the after withering all night under cover, it will be ready\r\nnext morning. If not ready next morning, put it out in the sun, if\r\nthere is any, till it is ready.\r\n\r\nIn very wet and cloudy weather, when there is no sun and continual\r\nrain, so that the leaf _cannot_ be put outside (for remember that\r\noutside, when there is no sun, the light alone will wither it),\r\nartificial withering of some kind must be resorted to. I have mentioned\r\nthe only means I know of for doing this.\r\n\r\nAs properly withered leaf is an important point in making good Tea, it\r\nis well worth while to keep one or two men, according to the quantity\r\nof leaf, for that work alone. They soon learn the best way to do it,\r\nand if made answerable the leaf is properly ready for the rollers,\r\nthe object is generally attained. In this and every thing else in Tea\r\nmanufacture, give different men different departments, and make them\r\nanswerable. Much trouble to the manager, who should supervise all, and\r\nmuch loss to the proprietor from bad Tea, will then be avoided.\r\n\r\n_Rolling._--This is a simple operation enough when the men have got the\r\nknack of it. Some planters advocate a circular motion of the hands when\r\nrolling, under the impression it gives the leaf a better twist. Some\r\nlike rolling it forward, but bringing it back without letting it turn\r\nduring the backward motion. I believe in neither way, for it appears\r\nto me to be rolled no better, or no worse, by these plans than by the\r\nordinary and quicker mode of simply rolling it _any way_. The forward\r\nand backward motion is the simplest and quickest, and the way all\r\nrollers adopt, who are given a certain quantity of leaf (say 30 lbs. a\r\nfair amount) to roll for their day’s work. In this ordinary rolling the\r\nball in the hand, ’tis true, does not turn much in the backward motion,\r\nfor ’tis more or less _pulled_ back, but whether it turns or not does\r\nnot, I believe, signify the least.\r\n\r\nRolling in hot pans was formerly extensively practised. It is not much\r\ndone now. I have tried the plan, but found no advantage in it.\r\n\r\nRolling on coarse mats, placed on the floor, might be seen also. When\r\nI visited the Assam Company’s gardens near Nazerah, in Assam, I saw it\r\ndone there. It is a great mistake. The coarse bamboo mat breaks the\r\nleaf sadly, and much of the sap or juice from the leaf, which adds much\r\nto the strength of the Tea, runs through the coarse mat, and is lost.\r\n\r\nOne and the principal reason why Indian Tea is stronger than Chinese is\r\nthat in India the sap or juice is generally retained, while in China it\r\nis, strange to say, purposely wasted!\r\n\r\nA strong immovable smooth table, with the planks of which it is formed\r\nwell joined together, so that no apertures exist for the juice of the\r\nleaf to run through, is the best thing to roll on. If covered with\r\na fine seetul pattie mat, nailed down over the edges of the table,\r\na still greater security is given against the loss of any sap, and\r\nI believe the slightly rough surface of the mat enables the leaf to\r\nroll better. An edging of wood one inch above the surface of the table\r\nshould be screwed on to the edges over the mat, if there is one, to\r\nprevent leaf falling off.\r\n\r\nThe leaf is rolled by a line of men on each side of such a table (4-1/2\r\nfeet is a good width for it) passing up from man to man, from the\r\nbottom of the table to the top. The passage of each handful of roll\r\nfrom man to man is regulated by the man at the end, who, when the roll\r\nin his hand is ready (that is, rolled enough), forms it into a tight\r\ncompressed ball (a truncated shape is the most convenient) and puts it\r\naway on an adjacent stand. When he does this, the roll each man has\r\npasses up one step.\r\n\r\nThe roll is ready to make up into a ball, when it is in a soft _mashy_\r\nstate, and when in the act of rolling it gives out juice freely. None\r\nof this juice must be lost, it must be mopped up into the roll, again\r\nand again in its passage up the table, and finally into the ball, when\r\nmade up.\r\n\r\nThere will be some coarse leaves in the roll which cannot be twisted.\r\nThese, if left, would give much red leaf in the Tea. They should be\r\npicked out by, say, the third or fourth man from the head of the table,\r\nfor it is only when the leaf has been partly rolled that they show. The\r\nman who picks out the coarse leaf should not roll at all. He should\r\nspread the roll, and pick out as much as he can, between the time of\r\nreceiving and passing it on. In no case allow roll to accumulate by\r\nhim, for if so kept it hardens and dries, and gives extra work to the\r\nlast rollers to bring it into the mashy state again. Besides which\r\nI rather think, any such lengthened stoppage in the rolling helps\r\nto destroy Pekoe ends, and is certainly injurious to the perfect\r\nafter-fermentation, inasmuch as it (the fermentation) partly takes\r\nplace then.\r\n\r\nThis finishes the rolling process. Each man as stated can do 30 lbs.,\r\nbut there is further work for him to be now described.\r\n\r\n_Fermenting._--The balls accumulated are allowed to stand until\r\nfermented. I look on this being done to the right extent and no more,\r\nas perhaps the most important point in the whole manufacture.\r\n\r\nSome planters collect the roll after rolling in a basket, and there\r\nlet it ferment, instead of making it up into balls for that purpose\r\nas described. I much prefer the ball system for the following\r\nreasons:--When a quantity is put into a basket together and allowed\r\nto ferment a certain time, what was put in first is naturally more\r\nfermented than what was put in last, the former probably over, the\r\nlatter under-done. The balls, on the contrary, can be each taken in\r\nsuccession _in the order they were laid on the table_, and thus each\r\nreceive the same amount of fermentation. I think further the twist in\r\nthe leaf is better preserved by the ball plan, and also that a large\r\nquantity in a basket is apt to ferment too much in the centre.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe, so that practical use shall be made of\r\nit, _when_ the balls are sufficiently fermented. The outside of the\r\nball is no good criterion. It varies much in colour, affected by the\r\nextent the leaf was withered.[48] You must judge by the inside.\r\n\r\nPerhaps as good a rule as any is that half the twisted leaves inside\r\nshall be a rusty red, half of them green. Practice alone, however, will\r\nenable you to pronounce when the balls are properly fermented. There is\r\nno time to be fixed for it. The process is quicker in warm than cool\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThe fermentation should be stopped in _each_ ball just at the right\r\ntime. Great exactitude in this is all-important, and therefore, as I\r\nsay, the balls should be taken in rotation as they were laid down.\r\n\r\nThe fermentation is stopped by breaking up the ball. The roll is spread\r\nout _very_ thin, and at the same time any remaining coarse leaves are\r\npicked out.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the fermenting process.\r\n\r\n_Sunning._--The roll is then without _any_ delay put out in the sun,\r\nspread _very_ thin on dhallas or mats. When it has become blackish in\r\ncolour it is collected and re-spread, so that the whole of it shall be\r\naffected by the sun. With bright sunshine, an hour or even less suns it\r\nsufficiently. It is then at once placed in the dholes, which must be\r\nall ready to receive it.\r\n\r\nIf the weather is wet, it must, _directly_ the balls are broken up, and\r\nthe coarse leaf is picked out, be sent to the dholes. This is the only\r\nplan in wet weather, but the best Tea is made in fine weather.\r\n\r\n_Firing or Dholing._--In the case of wet weather, unless you have very\r\nmany dholes, fresh roll will come in long before the first is finished.\r\nThe only plan in this case is to half do it. Half-fired the roll does\r\nnot injure with _any_ delay, but even half an hour’s delay, between\r\nbreaking up the balls and commencing to drive off the moisture, is\r\nhurtful.\r\n\r\nIn any but wet weather necessitating it the roll can be fired at one\r\ntime, that is, not removed from the drawer until it has become Tea.\r\n\r\nThe roll in each drawer must be shaken up and re-spread two or three\r\ntimes, in the process of firing. The drawer must be taken off the fire\r\nto do this, or some of the roll would fall through into the fire, and\r\nthe smoke thus engendered would be hurtful. If the lowest drawer is\r\nmade to slide in and out a framework covered with zinc should be made\r\nto run into a groove below it, and this zinc protector should be always\r\nrun in before the lower drawer is moved. This is part of Mr. McMeekin’s\r\ninvention, and is very necessary to prevent roll from the lowest drawer\r\nfalling into the fire when it (the lower drawer) is moved.\r\n\r\nThe roll remains in the drawers, subject to the heat of the charcoal\r\nbelow, until it is quite dry and crisp. Any piece then taken between\r\nthe fingers should break with the slightest attempt to bend it.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture is now completed. The roll has become Tea.\r\n\r\nAll the above operations should be carefully conducted, but I believe\r\nthe secret of good Tea consists simply in, _first_, stopping the\r\nfermentation at the right moment; and, _secondly_, in commencing to\r\ndrive off the moisture immediately after.\r\n\r\nI do not say that the manufacture here detailed may not be improved\r\nupon later, but I do say that in the results of economy, strong liquor,\r\nand well twisted leaf, its results are very satisfactory, and not\r\nsurpassed by any other mode at present in vogue. I do not pretend that\r\nit will give Teas rich in Pekoe tips. To attain this, light rolling as\r\nshown must be resorted to, but just as far as Pekoe tips are procured\r\nso far must strength be sacrificed. Until the small Pekoe leaves can be\r\ndetached and manufactured separately, this must always be the case.\r\n\r\nFrom the Tea made as described by sifting and sorting, all the ordinary\r\nblack Teas of commerce, as detailed at page 137, can be produced,\r\nexcepting “Flowery Pekoe.”\r\n\r\nTo make Flowery Pekoe the closed bud and the one open leaf of the shoot\r\nare alone taken, and these are manufactured alone. It does not, as a\r\nrule, pay to make this Tea at all, though it fetches a long price. It\r\ndoes not pay for the following reasons:--\r\n\r\n1. After the head of the flush is taken the pickers that follow do not\r\nreadily recognise the remainder of the shoot, and consequently omit to\r\npick many of them. A heavy loss in the yield is thus entailed.\r\n\r\n2. The after Teas, made without these small leaves, are very inferior,\r\nas they are much weaker, and totally devoid of Pekoe tips.\r\n\r\n3. The labour, and _ergo_ the expense of picking the flush, is double.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of Flowery Pekoe is simple enough. When the two leaves\r\nfrom each shoot of which it is made are collected they are exposed to\r\nthe sun, spread out very thin, until they have well shrivelled. They\r\nare then placed over small and slow charcoal fires, and so roasted very\r\nslowly. If the above is well done, the Pekoe tips (and there is little\r\nelse) come out a whitish orange colour. The whiter they are the better.\r\nIf the leaf is rolled _very lightly_ by the hand _before_ sunning, the\r\nliquor will be darker and stronger, but the colour of the tips will not\r\nbe so good.\r\n\r\nFlowery Pekoe is quite a fancy Tea, and for the reasons given above it\r\ncan never pay to make it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Green Tea._\r\n\r\nThe pans for this should be 2ft. 9in. diameter and 11in. in depth. They\r\nshould be thick pans, which will not, therefore, cool quickly. Many\r\nare required for this manufacture, four or five for every maund of Tea\r\nto be made daily. They should be set up in a sloping position, and the\r\narrangement of the fireplaces such that the wood to burn under them\r\ncan be put in through apertures leading into the verandah. One chimney\r\nwill do for every two pans, and it should be built high so as to give\r\na good draught, for hot fires are necessary.\r\n\r\nFlat-bladed sticks are used to stir both the leaf and the Tea in the\r\npans, for the hand cannot bear the heat.\r\n\r\nThe men when working the Tea in the pans should have high stools to sit\r\non, for it is a nine hours’ job.\r\n\r\nThe bags in which “the roll” is placed at night should be made of No.\r\n3 canvas, 2 feet long and 1 foot broad.\r\n\r\nI will now detail the manufacture.\r\n\r\nTo make Green Tea the leaf must be brought in twice in the day. What\r\ncomes in at one o’clock is partly made the same day. The evening leaf\r\nis left till the following morning, laying it thick (say 6 inches), so\r\nthat it will _not_ wither. But if the one o’clock or the evening leaf\r\ncomes in wet, they must both be dried, the former _before_ being put\r\ninto the pans, the latter _before_ being laid out for the night.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture thus begins twice daily, viz., morning and one o’clock,\r\nbut “the roll” of both these is treated together up to the time “the\r\nroll” is ready to place in the bags.\r\n\r\nThe leaf having no moisture in it is placed first in hot pans, at\r\na temperature of say 160°, and stirred with sticks for about seven\r\nminutes, until it becomes moist and sticky. It is then too hot to hold\r\nin the hand.\r\n\r\nIt is then rolled for two or three minutes on a table until it gets a\r\nlittle twisted.\r\n\r\nThen lay it out on dhallas in the sun (say 2 inches thick) for about\r\nthree hours, and roll it thrice during that time, always in the sun. It\r\nis ready to roll each time when “the roll” has become blackish on the\r\nsurface. It is not rolled more than three minutes each time, and then\r\nspread out as before. If you put on a proper number of men to do this\r\nthey do each dhalla in succession, and when they have done the last,\r\n“the roll” in the first dhalla will be blackish on the surface again,\r\nand ready to roll again.\r\n\r\nWhen three rollings are done, the roll should have a good twist on it.\r\n\r\nIt is then placed in the pans, at the same heat as before, and worked\r\nwith sticks as before for two or three minutes, until it becomes too\r\nhot to hold.\r\n\r\nIt is then stuffed, as tight as it _can_ be stuffed, into the bags\r\ndescribed above, putting as much into each bag as you can possibly get\r\nit to hold. The mouth is then tied up and the bag beaten with a flat\r\nheavy stick to consolidate the mass inside, and so it is left for the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nNext morning it is taken out of the bags, and worked with the flat\r\nsticks as before in the pans for nine hours without intermission. The\r\ntemperature 160° at first down to 120° at the last.\r\n\r\nDuring and owing to this last process the green colour is produced.[49]\r\nIt is worked quicker and quicker as the hours pass.\r\n\r\nThe following are the kinds of Tea into which it is best sorted:--\r\n\r\n  1. Ends         }\r\n  2. Young Hyson  }\r\n  3. Hyson        }   The relative value is in the order\r\n  4. Gunpowder    } in which they are numbered.\r\n  5. Dust         }\r\n  6. Imperial     }\r\n\r\nThe sorting of Green Tea is a nicer operation, and takes twice as long\r\nas sorting Black Tea.\r\n\r\nIf there are pans enough, and the work is well arranged, there should\r\nbe no night-work with Green Tea, for all should be over by 5 P.M.;\r\nwhereas with Black Tea night-work is generally a necessity.\r\n\r\nThe price obtained for Green Tea is more dependent on its _appearance_\r\nthan in the case of Black.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to make Black and Green Tea in the same factory.\r\n\r\nGreen Tea, if well made, pays much better than Black Tea; and, as\r\nbefore observed, I think all gardens with Chinese plants should adopt\r\nthe manufacture.[50] When once the building is fitted for it, and the\r\nroutine established, the Green Tea manufacture is always preferred by\r\nthose who have tried both.\r\n\r\nThe Hybrid plant makes the best Black, the Chinese the best Green Tea.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] In describing manufacture I shall call the leaf brought in “Leaf,”\r\nuntil it enters on the rolling process; from that time until the drying\r\nover charcoal is concluded, “Roll;” and after that, “Tea.”\r\n\r\n[37] Pekoe tips are the whitish or orange-coloured ends that may be\r\nseen in Pekoe Tea. See pages 105, 106, and 116.\r\n\r\n[38] The out-turn consists of the Tea leaves after infusion.\r\n\r\n[39] At the end of the season, however, sunning has more than the above\r\neffect. It then makes the Tea “Chubby” in form, of a reddish colour,\r\nand improves the strength of the liquor.\r\n\r\n[40] It is better, because the “tips” having been hard-rolled give\r\nstronger liquor.\r\n\r\n[41] It _was_ the best, but is superseded by a new rolling-machine\r\n(Jackson’s) I have seen quite lately.\r\n\r\nNote to Third Edition.--Jackson’s rolling-machine, by a late Calcutta\r\nlegal decision, is declared to be simply Kinmond’s, with alterations.\r\nAs Jackson is now prohibited from selling his machines, I presume the\r\ntwo inventors will come to some understanding as to the alterations,\r\nwhich are most certainly improvements.\r\n\r\n[42] I had not seen Jackson’s machine when I thought as above.\r\n\r\n[43] Unfortunately it is not. It is advertised at Rs. 300, with a\r\nyearly royalty of Rs. 50 the first year and 20 after. The royalty\r\nshould be dropped, and the machine sold for Rs. 150, which would give\r\nthe inventor a good profit.\r\n\r\n[44] Note to 3rd edition.--It is a question no longer. Many besides\r\nmyself have now proved that charcoal fumes are in no way necessary.\r\n\r\n[45] See this subject further discussed in the Addenda.\r\n\r\n[46] I now believe Jackson’s rolling-machine, previously alluded to,\r\nwill finish the rolling entirely.\r\n\r\n[47] Note to 3rd edition--I am now sending out the glass necessary for\r\na glass withering house to be erected on the garden just finished in\r\nthe Western Dooars.\r\n\r\n[48] The more the leaf is withered the thicker in consistency and the\r\nsmaller in quantity the juice that exudes, as also the yellower in\r\ncolour. Further, the more the leaf is withered the darker the outside\r\nof the balls. Bright rusty red is the colour produced with moderately\r\nwithered leaf; very dark greenish red with much withered leaf.\r\n\r\n[49] Much Green Tea is coloured, but none from India has been so\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\n[50] Note to Third Edition.--Since this was written Green Teas have\r\ngone down considerably in value. They are still much used in America,\r\nbut in Great Britain there is but little demand for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nSIFTING AND SORTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nSifting is a very important item in the manufacture of Tea. Careful\r\nand judicious sifting, as contrasted with the reverse, may make a\r\ndifference of two or three annas a lb. in the sale of Teas.\r\n\r\nI was shown some Tea quite lately which, as regards “liquor,” was\r\nvalued by the brokers at Re. 1-3 per lb., but the “Tea” at only 14\r\nannas! This was entirely owing to faulty sifting and sorting.\r\n\r\nI don’t believe in _any_ machine for Tea sifting, simply because it is\r\nnot a regular process.[51] For example, you cannot say that, to make\r\nPekoe, you must first use one sieve, then another, and so on. The sizes\r\nof sieves to be used, and the order in which they are to be used, will\r\nvary continually, as both are decided by varying causes, viz., the\r\ncomparative fineness or coarseness of the Tea made daily, the greater\r\nor less presence of red leaf in it, and (because Tea varies much during\r\nthe season, and gets coarse towards the end) by the time of the year.\r\nThese points all necessitate changes in the sizes, and the order of the\r\nsieves.\r\n\r\n’Tis true sieves might be changed in a machine as required, but the\r\nonly machine that could even pretend to save labour would be one in\r\nwhich all the sieves were arranged one below the other, and thus the\r\nTea would fall through each alternately, the motion being common to\r\nall. But this won’t do for Tea sifting. Judgment must be used to\r\ndecide _the length of time_ each sieve is to be shaken; further, with\r\n_how much motion_ it shall be shaken, &c., &c. But this is simply\r\nimpossible with any machine, though all necessary to sift Tea well.\r\n\r\nThe cost of Tea sifting by hand (see page 161) is not eight annas _per\r\nmaund_, including picking out red leaf, which _must_ be hand-work. Good\r\nand bad sifting will affect the value three annas per lb. or Rs. 15 per\r\nmaund!\r\n\r\nWith all parts of Tea manufacture it is well to employ the same men\r\ncontinually in each department, but above all, perhaps, should this be\r\ndone in Tea sifting. A good sifter is a valuable man. He knows each\r\nkind of Tea by name; he knows what sieves to use, and the order in\r\nwhich to use them for each Tea; what the effect a larger or smaller\r\nmesh will have on each kind, &c., &c. In fact, he knows much more of\r\nthe _practical_ part of sifting than his master can, though the latter\r\nis, probably, a better judge how far the Teas are perfect when made.\r\n\r\nTea sieves are of two kinds, both round. One made of brass wire, with\r\nwooden sides, 3-1/2 inches high, the other cane, with bamboo sides,\r\n1-1/4 inches high only. The latter are called “Chinese sieves,” and\r\nthough the brass ones are used in many places, there is no possible\r\ncomparison between them, for the labour required in the use of the\r\nbrass ones is much greater, and the results, as regards well sorted\r\nTea, much better with the Chinese.\r\n\r\nBoth kinds are numbered according to the number of orifices in one\r\nlinear inch. Thus a No. 6 sieve has six orifices to the inch in both;\r\nbut in the brass kind, a No. 6 has six orifices _including_ the wire;\r\nin the Chinese kind, the cane between each aperture is _not_ included\r\nin the measure. Thus the orifice in a No. 6 Chinese sieve is exactly\r\n1/6th of an inch square, but somewhat less in a brass sieve.\r\n\r\nAs I well know brass sieves cannot remain in favour after the others\r\nhave been only once tried, I shall confine my directions to the Chinese\r\nkind.[52]\r\n\r\nI practise, and I advise, Tea to be sifted daily. The Tea made one day,\r\nsifted the day after, and in fact stored away in the bins ready sifted.\r\nI find it is more carefully done this way, for by the other plan a\r\nlarger quantity being done at once by several men, they cannot, from\r\nwant of practice, be expert. But by the daily plan one, two, or three\r\nmen, as necessary, can always be kept on the work, and consequently\r\nthey learn and do it well.\r\n\r\nTo sift the following, Chinese sieves are required; and if daily\r\nsifting is resorted to, they will be found ample for any ordinary-sized\r\ngarden:--\r\n\r\n  4 of No. 4\r\n  6 of No. 6\r\n  6 of No. 7\r\n  9 of No. 9\r\n  9 of No. 10\r\n  6 of No. 12\r\n  4 of No. 16.\r\n\r\nPrevious to sifting all red leaf should be picked out of the Tea. This,\r\nas stated under the head of “Manufacture,” should be done twice before\r\nthe “roll” is fired; but towards the end of the season especially, some\r\nwill still remain in the made Tea, and this must be carefully separated.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have said it is evident that no rules can be laid down as\r\nto what sieves to employ to get out certain Teas. Only practice can\r\nteach this.\r\n\r\nFurther, practice can only enable you to judge in a Tea broker’s\r\npoint of view of different classes of Tea. This essay would,\r\nhowever, be incomplete did it not contain a description of these.\r\nSuch a description has been ably given by Mr. J. H. Haworth in his\r\n“Information and Advice for the Tea Planter from the English Market”\r\n(_Journal, A. & H. Society of India, Vol. XIV._), and, as his knowledge\r\non the subject is far in advance of mine, and consequently more to the\r\npoint than any description I could give, I will close this chapter with\r\nthe following extract from his valuable pamphlet, and trust he will\r\nexcuse my doing so:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Different Classes of Tea._\r\n\r\n  Teas are arranged in various classes according to the size, make,\r\n  and colour of the leaf. I treat first and principally of the Black\r\n  descriptions, as Green Teas are manufactured in only a few of the\r\n  Tea-growing districts of India.\r\n\r\n  The following classes come under the name of Black Tea:--\r\n\r\n  Flowery Pekoe.                        { Broken Pekoe.\r\n  Orange Pekoe.                         { Pekoe Dust.\r\n  Pekoe.             The various broken { Broken Mixed Tea.\r\n  Pekoe Souchong.      kinds, viz.:--   { Broken Souchong.\r\n  Souchong.                             { Broken Leaf.\r\n  Congou.                               { Fannings.\r\n  Bohea.                                { Dust.\r\n\r\n  We occasionally meet with other names, but they are generally\r\n  original, and ought not to be encouraged, as a few simple terms like\r\n  the above are sufficiently comprehensive to describe all classes\r\n  manufactured.\r\n\r\n  Perhaps before entering into a detailed description of the various\r\n  classes it will be well to explain the term “Pekoe” (pronounced\r\n  Pek-oh), which as we see occurs in so many of the names above quoted.\r\n  It is said to be derived from the Chinese words “Pak Ho,” which are\r\n  said to signify white down. The raw material constituting Pekoe when\r\n  manufactured is the young bud just shooting forth, or the young\r\n  leaf just expanded, which on minute examination will be found to be\r\n  covered with a whitish velvety down. On firing these young leaves,\r\n  the down simply undergoes a slight change in colour to grey or\r\n  greyish yellow, sometimes as far as a yellowish orange tint.\r\n\r\n  When the prepared Tea consists entirely of greyish or greenish\r\n  greyish Pekoe, with no or very little dark leaf mixed, it is called\r\n  Flowery Pekoe.\r\n\r\n  Flowery Pekoe is picked from the shrub entirely separate from the\r\n  other descriptions of Tea, only the buds and young leaves being\r\n  taken. In the preparation it is not subjected so severely to the\r\n  action of heat as the other classes of Tea, and generally preserves\r\n  a uniform greenish grey or silvery grey tint. Its strength in liquor\r\n  is very great, flavour more approaching that of Green Teas, but\r\n  infinitely superior, having the strength and astringency, without the\r\n  bitterness, of the green descriptions. The liquor is pale, similar to\r\n  that of Green Tea, and the infused leaf is of a uniform green hue. In\r\n  many instances, where too much heat has been employed, we find dark\r\n  leaves intermixed, and the prevailing colour, green, is sprinkled\r\n  with leaves of a salmony brown tinge, which is the proper colour for\r\n  the out-turn of any other ordinary black leaf Tea. A very common\r\n  mistake is to call an ordinary Pekoe, that may contain an extra\r\n  amount of Pekoe ends, Flowery Pekoe. When this class of Tea is strong\r\n  and of Flowery Pekoe flavour, it is called by the trade a Pekoe of\r\n  Flowery Pekoe kind. In England Flowery Pekoe sells, as a rule, from\r\n  4_s._ 6_d._ to 6_s._ 6_d._ per lb. One parcel has sold as high as\r\n  7_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n  By many people the expediency of making Flowery Pekoe is much\r\n  doubted. The true Flowery Pekoe leaf is the one undeveloped bud at\r\n  the end of each twig. To pick this alone, without any ordinary Pekoe\r\n  leaves, involves a great deal of trouble and expense, and I think\r\n  though the Flowery Pekoe be very valuable, that the account would\r\n  hardly balance when we consider the deterioration of the Pekoe by the\r\n  abstraction of the young leaves.\r\n\r\n  The ordinary Pekoe is a Tea of blackish or greyish blackish aspect,\r\n  but dotted over with greyish or yellowish leaves which, on close\r\n  inspection, will be found to possess the downy appearance which\r\n  gives the name to Pekoe. In general we do not find the whole leaf\r\n  covered with down, but only part of it, which in its growth has been\r\n  developed later than the other parts. These are called by the trade\r\n  “Pekoe ends” when very small Pekoe tips. A Pekoe is generally of good\r\n  to fine flavour, and very strong, and its liquor dark. Its value is\r\n  from 2_s._ 9_d._ to 3_s._ 8_d._ per lb.\r\n\r\n  When the Pekoe ends are of yellowish or orange hue, and the leaf is\r\n  very small and even, the Tea is called Orange Pekoe. In flavour it is\r\n  much the same as an ordinary Pekoe, and many growers do not separate\r\n  the two varieties, but send them away in the finished state mixed\r\n  together. Its value is from 2_d._ to 4_d._ per lb. more than Pekoe.\r\n\r\n  The term Pekoe Souchong is generally applied to a Pekoe that is\r\n  deficient in Pekoe ends, or to a bold, Souchong class leaf with a\r\n  few ends mixed. We often meet with it applied to an unassorted Tea,\r\n  including perhaps Souchong, Congou, a few Pekoe ends, and some broken\r\n  leaves. Prices range from 2_s._ 3_d._ to 2_s._ 10_d._\r\n\r\n  The name of Broken Pekoe indicates at once what class of Tea it is,\r\n  namely, Pekoe which has been broken in the manipulation or otherwise.\r\n  It possesses the strength and fine flavour of a full leaf of Pekoe,\r\n  being therefore only inferior to it in point of leaf. In value it is\r\n  very little inferior to Pekoe, sometimes as valuable, or even more\r\n  so, as owing to the frangibility of the tender Pekoe ends, they are\r\n  sometimes broken off in very large quantity, thus adding to the value\r\n  of the broken Tea, though at the same time deteriorating the Pekoe.\r\n  Prices from 2_s._ 6_d._ to 3_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\n  Pekoe dust is still smaller broken, so small in fact as actually to\r\n  resemble dust. It is of great strength, though often not pure in\r\n  flavour, as frequently any dust or sweepings from other Tea is mixed\r\n  with it to make the lot larger. The price of Pekoe dust may range\r\n  from 1_s._ 6_d._ to 2_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\n  A Tea only slightly broken is often called by the planter Pekoe\r\n  Dust; again an Orange Pekoe is often called Broken Pekoe, and the\r\n  converse. A knowledge of the signification of these and other terms\r\n  would teach the grower to be very careful in marking his Teas, as the\r\n  nomenclature influences to a great extent the sale in the home market.\r\n\r\n  Having described the finer Teas, we now come to the consideration of\r\n  the classes of Tea which form the bulk of the manufacture of a garden.\r\n\r\n  Souchong may be taken as the medium quality, and when experience and\r\n  skilled labour are employed in the manufacture as the bulk of the\r\n  produce of an estate. The qualifications for being comprehended under\r\n  this term are just simply an even, straight, or slightly curved leaf,\r\n  in length varying say from 1/2 inch to 1-1/2 inch. It has not the\r\n  deep strength of Pekoe, but is generally of good flavour and of fair\r\n  strength. The prices of Souchong are from 1_s._ 10_d._ to 2_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\n  Congou comes next. It may be either a leaf of Souchong kind, but too\r\n  large to come under that class, or though of smallish-sized leaf,\r\n  too unevenly made, or too much curled (so as to resemble little\r\n  balls) to be so classified. The flavour is much the same as that of\r\n  Souchong, but the Tea has not so much strength. Some of the lower and\r\n  large leaf kinds may be only worth perhaps from 1_s._ 3_d._ to 1_s._\r\n  6_d._, whereas the finer qualities sell as high as 2_s._ to 2_s._\r\n  3_d._ per lb.\r\n\r\n  Bohea is again lower than a Congou. It may be either of too large\r\n  a leaf to be called Congou, or, as is generally the case, it may\r\n  consist principally of old leaf, which on being fired does not attain\r\n  the greyish blackish colour which is so desirable for all the black\r\n  leaf kinds except Flowery Pekoe, but remains of a brownish or even\r\n  pale yellowish hue. It has scarcely any strength, and is generally\r\n  of coarse flavour, sometimes not, but is never of much value unless\r\n  of _Namuna_ kind (a term which will be described hereafter). We may\r\n  quote prices at from 3_d._ to 1_s._ 2_d._ per lb.\r\n\r\n  We now come to the broken descriptions of these middle and lower\r\n  classes of Tea.\r\n\r\n  Broken Mixed Tea is, as its name imports, a mixture of the various\r\n  kinds of Tea broken. It may have a very wide range, include some of\r\n  the lower classes or approach Broken Pekoe in character and value,\r\n  but the kind usually thus named is a Tea worth from 1_s._ 8_d._ to\r\n  2_s._ 6_d._, generally of a blackish aspect, and containing a few\r\n  Pekoe ends.\r\n\r\n  The term Broken Souchong is commonly and appropriately applied to a\r\n  Tea which, though broken, has some approach to a full leaf, and that\r\n  of the even Souchong character. Its value may vary, say from 1_s._\r\n  6_d._ to 2_s._ 2_d._\r\n\r\n  Broken leaf is a term of great comprehensiveness, but generally is\r\n  used to signify a Tea worth from 8_d._ to 1_s._ 1_d._ per lb. It\r\n  may be of a brownish, brownish blackish, or blackish colour. Its\r\n  strength is seldom great, but its flavour may be fair or good, but in\r\n  the lower qualities it is generally poor, thin, or coarse. It would\r\n  be better to employ this term only as a general name of Broken Tea,\r\n  and not to use it to signify any particular class, as it is very\r\n  indefinite.\r\n\r\n  Fannings is similar in colour and class of leaf to broken leaf as\r\n  described above; in value also much the same, perhaps on the average\r\n  a little lower. I suppose, in most cases, the mode of its separation\r\n  from the other classes of Tea is, as its name implies, by fanning.\r\n\r\n  Dust is a very small broken Tea, so small, in fact, as to approach\r\n  the minuteness of actual dust. It is often very coarse, or “earthy”\r\n  in flavour, owing perhaps to sweepings and dust having become mixed\r\n  with it. Its value is from 6_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ In any Tea of this\r\n  class worth more than these quotations, a few Pekoe ends or tips\r\n  will generally be found, which bring it under the name of Pekoe Dust.\r\n\r\n  We will now look at Black Teas in a body, and point out what is\r\n  desirable and what is objectionable in them.\r\n\r\n  We have seen that all Teas which contain Pekoe fetch higher prices\r\n  than others, consequently we infer that Pekoe is a desideratum. If\r\n  we glance at the descriptions of the various classes of Tea which\r\n  have been given above, we shall find that it is an element of\r\n  strength and good flavour. I do not mean to say that any Pekoe is\r\n  stronger or of better flavour than any Tea which does not contain\r\n  Pekoe, as the soil, the climate, the cultivation, the manufacture,\r\n  and various other causes, may influence the strength and flavour of\r\n  different Teas; but, as a rule, in Teas that are produced under the\r\n  same circumstances, the classes containing Pekoe are stronger and of\r\n  better flavour than those without it.\r\n\r\n  There is another class of Tea which I have not yet described that\r\n  possesses very great strength and very fine flavour. This is the\r\n  class known as the “Namuna” kind. All readers of these pages who\r\n  have been connected with India any time will recognise the word,[53]\r\n  though they may not quite see how it comes to occupy the position\r\n  in which we consider it. It is said that its first application in\r\n  this manner arose from a planter having sent to England some sample\r\n  boxes of Tea with the ticket “namuna” on them. These Teas happened\r\n  to be of the peculiar description which now goes by that name, and\r\n  which I proceed to describe. The London brokers have always since\r\n  then applied the name “namuna” to this class of Tea. The leaf may\r\n  have, perhaps, the ordinary greyish blackish aspect, with generally\r\n  a greenish tinge. In the pot it produces a very pale liquor, but\r\n  on tasting it its quality belies the poor thin appearance of the\r\n  infusion. It is very strong, stronger by far than ordinary Pekoe; in\r\n  flavour, say, about half-way between a Flowery Pekoe and a Green Tea,\r\n  quite distinct from the Flowery Pekoe flavour, possessing somewhat\r\n  of the rasping bitterness of the Green Tea class with the flavour a\r\n  little refined. The out-turn is generally green, sometimes has some\r\n  brownish leaves mixed. Any of the black leaf Teas may be of this\r\n  Class, from the Pekoe to the lowest dust, and all throughout the\r\n  scale, if the flavour be distinct and pure, may have their value\r\n  enhanced from 4_d._ to 10_d._ per lb.\r\n\r\n  Similar in every respect, except one, is the Oolong kind. The one\r\n  wanting quality is the strength, sometimes, by-the-bye, the flavour\r\n  is a little different. It may have the greenish, greyish blackish\r\n  leaf (though generally the green leaves are distinct from black ones,\r\n  the Tea thus being composed of greyish blackish leaves with a few\r\n  green ones intermixed), always has the pale liquor, generally the\r\n  greenish infused leaf; but sometimes it is sadly intermingled with\r\n  black leaves, as it is a Tea whose flavour is frequently burnt out,\r\n  though its weakness and green appearance are no doubt often caused\r\n  by deficient firing. Teas of this kind on the average sell below the\r\n  ordinarily-flavoured Teas of the same class of leaf.\r\n\r\n  In Teas of ordinary flavour the following rules hold good:--The\r\n  darker the liquor the stronger the Tea, and the nearer the approach\r\n  of the colour of the infused leaf to a uniform salmony brown, the\r\n  purer the flavour. Whenever we see any black leaves mixed with\r\n  it (the out-turn) the Tea has been over-fired, and we may either\r\n  expect to find the strength burnt out of it, or else to find it\r\n  marred by having a burnt or smoky flavour incorporated with it.\r\n  When you come across an altogether black or dirty brown out-turn,\r\n  you may be certain of pale liquor containing little or no strength\r\n  and no flavour to speak of, unless sometimes it be sour. This is a\r\n  quality which I shall now touch upon, and regret that I cannot with\r\n  any certainty give any reliable information whereby the planter\r\n  may guard against this greatest of faults. It may have various\r\n  grades,--slightly sourish, sourish, and sour, depreciating the value\r\n  of the Tea, say, from 3_d._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ per lb. The flavour of a\r\n  sour Tea is hardly capable of description. It is not so acid as sour\r\n  milk, in fact, not acid at all, rather a sweet flavour than otherwise\r\n  being blended with the sourness. It is extremely unpleasant in its\r\n  more developed grades, and cannot be easily understood except by\r\n  actual tasting. To the uninitiated this fault is only perceptible in\r\n  the more strongly marked instances, but to one of the trade the least\r\n  tendency to it not only condemns the parcel at once, but also causes\r\n  him to suspect any other lots made at the same or any other time by\r\n  the same grower, and it is a curious but unaccountable fact that some\r\n  two or three gardens (or growers?) almost always produce Teas having\r\n  this fault. I will not cite all the different explanations that have\r\n  been offered on this subject; I will simply quote the one which\r\n  seems to have gained most ground, and leave those more competent than\r\n  myself to express any opinion on the subject. The cause assigned to\r\n  which I refer is that the Tea leaf after being picked is allowed to\r\n  remain too long in the raw state before being fired, during which\r\n  time it undergoes a process of fermentation; some then say that\r\n  this causes sourness, while others maintain that the fermentation\r\n  is absolutely necessary for the production of a Black Tea. The fact\r\n  that we never meet with sourness in a Green Tea, one feature in the\r\n  preparation of which being that it is fired almost immediately on\r\n  being gathered, goes to corroborate this view.\r\n\r\n  Burntness I have already referred to. As I said before, it may either\r\n  destroy the strength and flavour altogether, or sometimes, without\r\n  destroying the strength, add an unpleasant burnt flavour to it.\r\n  When the Tea has the flavour of smoke about it, it is called smoky\r\n  or smoky burnt. By being burnt, a Tea may be deteriorated in value,\r\n  say from 2_d._ to 1_s._ per lb. The symptoms of burntness are a dead\r\n  black leaf (as opposed to the greatly-desired greyish, blackish\r\n  colour) having a burnt smell which often entirely neutralises the\r\n  natural aroma of the Tea. In looking over a broker’s character of\r\n  a parcel of Teas, you may occasionally meet with the terms “fresh\r\n  burnt,” “brisk burnt,” or “malty burnt.” These phrases do not carry\r\n  a condemnatory meaning with them. The meaning of the word burnt, as\r\n  used here, would be better expressed by the term “fired.” The term\r\n  “malty” means of full rich flavour, perhaps from the aroma of this\r\n  class of Tea resembling somewhat that of malt. Teas of the three\r\n  above descriptions, you may have noticed, often fetch very good\r\n  prices. The meaning of the word “full,” applied to a liquor, is\r\n  hardly appreciable except by tasting. It does not signify strength\r\n  or flavour, but is opposed to thinness. A Green Tea may be strong or\r\n  of good flavour, but its liquor is never full. Fulness is generally\r\n  characterised by a dark liquor. The quality known as “body” in a wine\r\n  is somewhat akin to fulness in a Tea. We speak of a “full” leaf Tea\r\n  in contradistinction to a broken leaf. “Chaffy” is generally used in\r\n  connection with Bohea and other brown leaf classes of Tea. A light\r\n  (in weight) brown, open or flat leaf, in fact, one resembling chaff,\r\n  would be called chaffy. The lower classes of Tea, especially the\r\n  dusts, are often described as “earthy” in flavour. By this a coarse\r\n  low flavour is understood, perhaps often caused by the admixture of\r\n  real dust.\r\n\r\n  When the make of a Tea is spoken of as a “well made,” “fairly made,”\r\n  &c., leaf, the effect of the manipulation or rolling is referred\r\n  to. We may have a “well made even,” or a “well made mixed large and\r\n  small,” leaf. We may have a “straight” or “curled,” or, as the latter\r\n  is generally expressed when applied to a large leaf Tea, “twisted”\r\n  leaf. It may be “flattish made,” indicating that though the leaf is\r\n  not open it wears a flattish aspect, or it may be open, which betrays\r\n  a want of sufficient or skilful manipulation. A “wiry” leaf is small,\r\n  perfectly rolled, and very thin (in diameter), generally rather\r\n  curled, so as in fact to resemble small pieces of bent wire. It\r\n  will be seen at once that only the finer Teas can have a wiry leaf,\r\n  principally the Orange Pekoes and Pekoes. Sometimes we meet with a\r\n  fine Souchong that may be thus described.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Green Teas._\r\n\r\n  As in the North-west Provinces Green Teas form the bulk of the\r\n  produce, it will be well to give a short description of them, though\r\n  the tenor of my remarks below will show the general opinion as to the\r\n  desirability of making them.[54]\r\n\r\n  Gunpowder is the most valuable description, its price ranging from\r\n  2_s._ 8_d._ to 3_s._ 8_d._ per lb. Instead of possessing the long and\r\n  thin finished leaf, which is the desideratum of Black Teas, it is\r\n  rolled into little balls more or less round, varying from one-eighth\r\n  to one-quarter of an inch in diameter. Sometimes it is not altogether\r\n  composed of round leaf, but has some long leaf mixed.\r\n\r\n  When the Tea is of the shape of Gunpowder, but is larger than the\r\n  size above quoted, it is called Imperial. Prices of Imperial are from\r\n  10_d._ to 2_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n  Amongst Green Teas Hyson may be taken as the parallel of Souchong\r\n  of the black leaf descriptions. Undoubtedly there is often much\r\n  young Pekoe leaf in it, but all chance of _discriminating_ it in the\r\n  finished leaf is done away with by the change in colour. Hysons sell\r\n  from 1_s._ 2_d._ to 3_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n  Young Hyson is smaller than Hyson, occasionally slightly broken. It\r\n  fetches from 7_d._ to 2_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n  Hyson skin consists of the bold broken leaf of Hyson and Young\r\n  Hyson. A small broken Green Tea is seldom sent on the home market.\r\n  The reason of this is obvious. When we consider that Hyson skin only\r\n  fetches from 7_d._ to 1_s._, it is apparent that anything approaching\r\n  a dust would give very little chance of a profit. I have seen one or\r\n  two parcels, too much broken to come under the title of Hyson skin,\r\n  sell at 3_d._ to 6_d._ per lb. in London. It would be well if some\r\n  of the Indian planters would take a lesson from the Chinese, and\r\n  not send home their very low Teas, black or green, as they are very\r\n  difficult of sale in London, and in many cases cannot pay the cost\r\n  of packing and shipping. The Chinese make a great quantity of their\r\n  broken Teas into Brick Tea, and send it into the Central Provinces of\r\n  Asia, where it meets with a ready sale. I do not see why this should\r\n  not be done by the Indian growers. There is a large consumption of\r\n  Tea on the other side of the Himalayas, not very far from Darjeeling\r\n  and Assam. I hear also that in the neighbourhood of the growing\r\n  districts, especially in the North-west Provinces, the natives are\r\n  beginning to consume largely, and will pay 8 as. to 1 rupee for a\r\n  Tea that could not possibly fetch more than 1_s._ to 1_s._ 6_d._ per\r\n  lb. in England. Whether the natives of India, as a whole, do or do\r\n  not take to drinking Tea will have a material effect on the future\r\n  prospects of the article.\r\n\r\n  Before dropping the subject of Green Teas, I will say a word or two\r\n  as to the expediency of making Green Tea. I have questioned several\r\n  experienced people on the subject, but none can tell me their\r\n  especial object in manufacturing their leaf into Green Tea. One\r\n  gentleman told me that he thought it was because their Tea-makers\r\n  (Chinamen) knew better how to make greens than blacks. I have\r\n  carefully examined the leaf of several of the North-west Green Teas,\r\n  and, noticing their English sale prices, consider that they would\r\n  have sold on the average at least 3_d._ per lb. higher had they been\r\n  made into Black Tea. The best way to test this would be to have a\r\n  Green and a Black Tea made from the same leaf, and then to value the\r\n  one against the other. I regret that I have never had the opportunity\r\n  of doing this. We notice that the largest and most experienced\r\n  producers never make Green Tea.[55]\r\n\r\n  I must not pass over Caper without a short description. It is a Tea\r\n  which is made in large quantity in China, though I have only seen one\r\n  parcel of Indian growth. It forms a link between the black and green\r\n  descriptions. The colour of the leaf is a very dark green; in form it\r\n  is similar to a gunpowder, Imperial, or round leaf Congou. The liquor\r\n  is pale, and the out-turn green; flavour perhaps nearer to that of a\r\n  green than of a Black Tea.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[51] We have yet to see what Jackson’s machine can do.\r\n\r\n[52] Even to break Tea on them it is a mistake to use brass sieves. Tea\r\nis best broken by a wooden roller, heavily weighed with lead, run in.\r\nThe glaze or gloss on Tea is thus preserved.\r\n\r\n[53] I need hardly remark that the Hindustani word _Namuna_ (pronounced\r\n_Nemoona_) means _sample_.\r\n\r\n[54] I think I need hardly pause to correct the popular error that the\r\nGreen and Black Teas are made from two different species of plant. Most\r\nof my readers will know that they are both made from the same leaf, the\r\ndifference lying only in the manufacture.\r\n\r\n[55] Note to Third Edition.--As previously stated in foot-note page\r\n133, Green Teas are now but little used in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nBOXES. PACKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy far the best Tea boxes are the teak ones made at Rangoon. The\r\nwood is impervious to insects of all kinds, even white ants. Sawn by\r\nmachinery the pieces sent to compose each box are very regular. The\r\nplank is half inch, and each chest made up measures inside 23 by 18 by\r\n18-1/2 inches, and necessarily outside 24 by 19 by 19-1/2 inches. The\r\ninner cubical contents are 7,659 cubic inches, and this suffices for\r\nabove one maund of fine, and under a maund of coarse Tea.\r\n\r\nEach box is composed of fourteen pieces--viz., for the two long sides\r\nthree each, for the two short sides two each, two for the bottom, and\r\ntwo for the lid. By the arrangement of three pieces in the long sides,\r\nand two only in the short sides, the centre piece of each long side is\r\nattached to _both_ the short end pieces, and thus great strength in the\r\nbox is ensured, there being no place where it can possibly separate at\r\nthe joints.\r\n\r\nThese boxes are not made to “dovetail.” Each piece (and they are sawn\r\nwith mathematical regularity as to length, breadth, and thickness) must\r\nbe nailed to its neighbour. The best nails for this are the kind called\r\n“French Pins,” 1-3/4 inches long.\r\n\r\nThe wood is sold at Rangoon in bundles, and could be landed in Calcutta\r\nfor about Re. 1-8 or 1-12 per box. The boxes need not be made up till\r\nshortly before they are wanted, and in this form, of compact bundles of\r\nshort pieces, are very convenient for transport and stowage.\r\n\r\nOf course in many districts these boxes are not procurable, and local\r\nones must be made. If so, use hard wood, and make your boxes _about_\r\nthe size given above, for small boxes add much to the cost of freight.\r\n\r\nLet the planks be 5/8 inch thick, for 1/2 inch, that is, 4/8 inch\r\nboards are not strong enough, except they are of teak or any other very\r\ngood wood.\r\n\r\nTake care the joints of the several pieces composing the sides and ends\r\ndo _not_ coincide at the corners, for if they do the box is very apt to\r\ncome asunder.\r\n\r\nThe best way to arrange the pieces is as described above in the Rangoon\r\nboxes.\r\n\r\n“A form” must be made on which the inner leaden case shall be\r\nconstructed, that is, a well-made smooth box, to fit _exactly_ into the\r\nbox you pack in. It must be some 3 inches higher than the interior of\r\nthe original box, and have bars running across inside, for handles to\r\nlift it up, and let the lead case slip off it, after it (the lead case)\r\nis finished.\r\n\r\nSolder your lead case, over your form, in the way to waste least lead.\r\nIn the Rangoon boxes described, two large, two small sheets,[56]\r\nand one piece, 22 by 9 inches (let in between the two large sheets)\r\nsuffices, and there is little or no waste.\r\n\r\nThe lead case ready, hold up the form by the inner rods, and let the\r\ncase slide off. Put it at once into the packing-box, taking care no\r\nnails protrude inside, or anything else which will hurt it, and thus\r\nprepare all the boxes for the break of Tea you are about to pack.\r\n\r\nOne great advantage the Rangoon boxes, and in fact all machine-sawn\r\nboxes, have is their equal, or nearly equal, weight. Purchasers of\r\nTeas, at the public auctions, require “the tare” of boxes to be as\r\nnear the same weight as possible. If the tares differ, say more than\r\nhalf-a-pound, the Tea will be depreciated in value.[57] It is well\r\nthere should be about the same weight of Tea in all the boxes that\r\ncontain any one kind, but this is not essential, which equality in\r\ntares is.\r\n\r\nYour boxes all ready and lined with lead, choose a fine day for\r\npacking. Do this whether you finally dry the Tea in the sun or over the\r\ndholes; for even in the latter case it is well to avoid a damp day.\r\n\r\nBut before you pack you must bulk. That is, you must mix all the Tea,\r\nof any one kind, so intimately together that samples taken out of any\r\nnumber of chests shall agree exactly. This can be done by turning out\r\nall the Tea on a large cloth placed on the floor, and turning it over\r\nand over. No two days’ Teas are exactly alike, and you have perhaps a\r\nmonth’s Teas to pack; it is therefore necessary to mix them well.\r\n\r\nThough I know many planters think the fumes of charcoal necessary and\r\nbeneficial for the last drying, I do not. I have tried both sun and\r\ncharcoal, and no difference was perceptible. The former costs nothing,\r\nis more commodious, and I always apply it when possible. The sun cannot\r\nburn the Teas; the charcoal, if the heat is too great, may.\r\n\r\nWhether you use sun or charcoal, put the Tea hot into the boxes. The\r\n_only_ object of the final drying is to drive off the moisture, which\r\nthe Tea will certainly, in a more or less degree, have imbibed since\r\nits manufacture. Even the large zinc-lined bins which should be fitted\r\nup in all Tea stores, and in which the Tea is placed after manufacture,\r\nwill not entirely prevent damp, so in all cases a final drying is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nKeep it in the sun, or over the charcoal, until it is hot throughout,\r\nhot enough to ensure all the moisture having been driven off. Then put\r\ninto the box enough to about one-quarter fill it. Now let two men rock\r\nthe box, over a half-inch round iron bar, placed on the ground, until\r\nthe Tea has well settled. Then place a piece of carpet over the Tea,\r\nthe exact size of the box, and let a man stand inside and press it down\r\na minute or two with his feet. Now fill up nearly another quarter, and\r\npress it again over the carpet as before. Repeat this, putting less and\r\nless into the box each time, as you near the top, until it is quite\r\nfull, but do not rock it at all the last two or three times, only press\r\nit with the feet as described. No patent screw press, or anything else,\r\nwill pack the Tea better or more closely than this plan, and when the\r\nmen are practised at it, you will find there will not be a difference\r\nof more than two or three lbs. in the Teas of any one kind put into the\r\nboxes.[58]\r\n\r\nThe box full, just even with the top, and well pressed down to the\r\nlast, lay over the Tea a piece of the silver paper, which is found\r\ninserted between each sheet in the lead boxes. This prevents any solder\r\nor resin getting on the Tea when soldering the top. Now fit on the lead\r\nsheet top, solder, and nail on the wooden lid.\r\n\r\n_Weight of Tea in each box._--The boxes ready lined, with a lead cover\r\nloose, must be all weighed _before_ the Tea is packed, and again\r\n_after_ they are filled and soldered down, but _before_ the wooden lid\r\nis put on. The difference of these weights, minus the weight of the\r\nlittle solder used in fastening down the top lead (for which allow say\r\none pound to give a margin also), will be the net weight of Tea in each\r\nbox.\r\n\r\nThin iron hooping, put round both ends of the boxes, much increases\r\ntheir strength, and is not expensive.[59]\r\n\r\nStamp each box on its lid and on one end.[60] Use for this zinc plates,\r\nwith the necessary marks cut out in them. A brush run over these with\r\nthe colouring matter does the work well and quickly.\r\n\r\nLet the stamp comprise the kind of Tea, the plantation or owner’s mark,\r\nthe number of the box, and the year; for instance--\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n        Pekoe.\r\n\r\n        \\ A /\r\n         \\ /\r\n       D  X  C\r\n         / \\\r\n        / B \\\r\n  No. 80     1871\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe invoice you send with the break must give for each box the number,\r\nthe gross weight, the tare, the net Tea, and the kind of Tea, with a\r\ndeclaration at foot that the Teas of each kind have been respectively\r\nwell bulked and mixed together before packing.\r\n\r\nRemember the larger the quantity of Tea, of any one kind, to be sold\r\nat one auction, the higher the price it will probably fetch. Sell, if\r\npossible, twenty or thirty chests of one kind of Tea at the same time,\r\nfor small quantities as a rule sell below large, both in Calcutta and\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nEquality of tares is the most important point to attend to in packing\r\nTeas. It may be difficult, but with machine-sawn boxes, nearly the\r\nsame weight, any difference must be made up with extra hooping, lead,\r\nsolder, or nails. Anyhow it _must_ be done, so that no tares shall\r\ndiffer more than half-a-pound (see foot-note page 149).\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[56] Large lead is 37 by 22 inches; small lead, 25 by 19 inches.\r\n\r\n[57] Note to Third Edition.--This matter of equal tares is very\r\nimportant. If they differ more than half-a-pound all the Tea is turned\r\nout and re-weighed in London, which is a great loss in many ways.\r\n\r\n[58] It is not essential that the same quantity of Tea shall be in each\r\nbox.\r\n\r\n[59] This should, except the lid part, be put on the boxes before the\r\nTea is packed.\r\n\r\n[60] The object of stamping the end, as well as the lid, is that when\r\nthe boxes are piled one above the other the mark can be read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT. ACCOUNTS. FORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem and order, a good memory, a good temper, firmness, attention to\r\ndetails, agricultural knowledge, industry, all these, combined with\r\na thorough knowledge of Tea cultivation and Tea manufacture, are the\r\nrequisites for the successful management of a Tea plantation.\r\n\r\nTo find men with _all_ these qualities is, I allow, not very easy,\r\nstill they do exist, and such a one must be had if success in Tea is\r\nlooked for.\r\n\r\nBefore the work is given out each day, the manager should decide\r\nexactly what is most required, and apply it to that. He should write\r\ndown, when distributing the men, the works, and the number employed on\r\neach. This paper he should carry in his pocket, and he can then verify\r\nthe men at work at each or any place when he visits it during the day.\r\n\r\nThe writer, the moonshee, and the jemadar (if there is one), should\r\nwrite similar papers when the coolies are mustered in the morning, and\r\nthe manager should detail to each of these men which work they are\r\nparticularly responsible for. This should also be shown in the “Morning\r\nPaper.”\r\n\r\nEach of the above men then measures out the work to the coolies; visits\r\nit once or oftener in the day, and measures all that remains undone at\r\nnight. A daily report of the work is kept, written by the writer in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThe two forms given below are those I have adopted. The latter is\r\nsuited to local labour paid daily, but it can easily be altered to\r\nsuit either local labour paid monthly or imported coolies.\r\n\r\nThis is the Morning Paper.\r\n\r\n  ===================================================================\r\n  _Work to be done on                                         188 ._\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Detail|No. of Garden|In whose charge|Headman on | Probable | Actual\r\n        |             |               | the Work  | number   | number\r\n  ------+-------------+---------------+-----------+----------+-------\r\n        |             |               |           |          |\r\n        |             |               |           |          |\r\n        |             |               |           |          |\r\n        |             |               |           |          |\r\n        |             |               |           |          |\r\n        |             |               |           |          |\r\n        |             |               |           |          |\r\n        |             |               |           |          |\r\n  ------+-------------+---------------+-----------+----------+-------\r\n                                               Total Coolies |\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe column of “Probable numbers” is given so that before it is known\r\nexactly how many men will be present for work they can be divided in\r\nthe most likely way.\r\n\r\nEach headman (called “Mate,” “Mangee,” &c., in different districts) is\r\nbest designated by a letter or number.

It entails a loss of time, and further a depreciation in the leaf,\r\nif it is kept long in a close mass in one basket, which is the case\r\nwhen each picker brings his or her leaf to the factory twice a day. The\r\npickers are paid so much per basket, holding in any case 2-1/2 lbs. I\r\nfind the most convenient plan is to give the mangee in charge of the\r\npickers tickets of any kind for this, which tickets are changed for\r\nmoney in the evening. As each load of leaf comes in through the day it\r\nis weighed, and this gives a check on the tickets given by the mangee\r\nor mate. This is the meaning of the two columns in the form below,\r\n“tickets by leaf” and “tickets paid.”\r\n\r\nIn the form the first column of “leaf results” shows the condition of\r\nthe leaf when picked, whether wet (W) or dry (D). Unless this were\r\nnoted the proper amount of Teas the leaf _ought_ to make could not be\r\nknown, and there would be no check against theft, which is carried on\r\nto a great extent in many gardens.\r\n\r\nAs explained previously, only the sections ready in each garden are\r\npicked. The sections are not entered in the form, only the number of\r\nthe garden. The flushes now noted are the 20th, in some the 21st, or\r\n22nd in others.\r\n\r\nThe Tea is calculated from the leaf. It should be 25 per cent. if the\r\nleaf is picked dry, and 22 per cent. if picked wet. As each load comes\r\nin a memorandum is made as to whether it is dry or wet, and the figures\r\nin the column “Tea should be” are thus found.\r\n\r\nThe Tea is weighed the morning after it is made and entered in the\r\ncolumn “Tea made.” The percentage it bears to the leaf is then\r\ncalculated and entered in the account column.\r\n\r\nAfter sifting the whole is weighed again, and the result entered in the\r\ncolumn “Tea after sifting.” Doing this is very important, for it checks\r\ntheft. Directly after it is weighed this second time it is put in the\r\nbins in the store.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Daily Leaf and Tea Account._\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------\r\n                            TEA RESULTS.\r\n  --------------+------+---------+---------+---------\r\n                |Tea   |         |         |Tea after\r\n        Date    |should|         |         |it is\r\n                |be    |Tea made |Per cent.|sifted\r\n  --------------+------+---------+---------+---------\r\n  October       |      |         |         |\r\n  Sunday, 1st   |„     |  „      |   „     |   „\r\n                |      |         |         |\r\n                |      |         |         |\r\n                |      |         |         |\r\n  Monday, 2nd   |198   |  200    |   24    |   199\r\n                |      |         |         |\r\n                |      |         |         |\r\n                |      |         |         |\r\n  Tuesday, 3rd  |231   |  230    |   25    |   233\r\n                |      |         |         |\r\n  Wednesday, 4th|      |         |         |\r\n  Thursday, 5th |      |         |         |\r\n  Friday, 6th   |      |         |         |\r\n  Saturday, 7th |      |         |         |\r\n                |      |         |         |\r\n  Total for     |„     |Mds. lbs.|         |\r\n    the week    |      |  1632   |         |\r\n  --------------+------+---------+---------+---------\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------\r\n                 LEAF RESULTS.\r\n  -----+--------------+-------+-----------------+-----\r\n  State|   Tickets    | Number|     Flushes     |\r\n  of   +-------+------+ of    +-----+-----+-----+Total\r\n  leaf |By leaf|Paid  | Garden|  20 |  21 |  22 |leaf\r\n  -----+-------+------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-----\r\n  220W |       |     {|   3   | „   | 170 | „   |\r\n  600D |  410  |360  {|   5   | 310 | „   | „   |\r\n       |       |     {|   7   | 112 | „   | „   |\r\n       |       |     {|   8   | „   | „   | 228 | 820\r\n       |       |      |       |     |     |     |\r\n   D   |  462  |440  {|   3   | „   | 515 | „   |\r\n       |       |     {|   9   | 410 | „   | „   | 925\r\n       |       |      |       |     |     |     |\r\n       |       |     {|   1   | 430 | „   | „   |\r\n   W   |  200  |180  {|   2   | „   | „   | 160 |\r\n       |       |     {|   3   | „   | 210 | „   | 800\r\n       |       |      |       |     |     |     |\r\n       |       |      |       |     |     |     |\r\n       |       |      |       |     |     |     |\r\n       |       |      |       |     |     |     |\r\n       |       |      |       |     |     |     |\r\n       |       |      |       |     |     |     |\r\n       |       |      |       |     |     |     |\r\n  -----+-------+------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-----\r\n\r\nIf this system is carried out, no Tea (exceeding a pound or so) can be\r\nstolen without its being at once missed, and the importance of this\r\ncannot be exaggerated. Tea proprietors do not guess _how_ much is lost\r\nin this way. Maunds upon maunds might be stolen in many gardens, and\r\nunless the theft were accidentally discovered there is nothing in the\r\nTea accounts to show it to the manager.\r\n\r\nI have suppositiously filled up the three first days of the form. The\r\n820 lbs. leaf picked on Sunday is made into Tea on Monday. The 198\r\nis written down Sunday evening. On Tuesday morning, when the Tea is\r\nweighed and found to be 200 lbs., that is entered in the Monday line,\r\nas also the percentage. On Tuesday evening, after it is sifted and made\r\ninto different Teas, it is weighed again and found to be 199 lbs., and\r\nso entered.\r\n\r\nIn dry weather after sifting, owing to dust flying off, it is always a\r\nlittle less. In wet weather, on the contrary, it increases in weight.\r\nIn the Tuesday line where “W” shows it was a wet day and the Tea 230\r\nlbs. before sifting it, is 233 afterwards. This is owing to moisture\r\nimbibed, and it is the only objection to sifting daily, whatever\r\nthe weather. The advantages of the plan, though, are so great, as\r\nexplained, that I put up with this, and practically I do not find it\r\ndetrimental. Of course, as previously explained, all moisture is driven\r\noff before the Tea is _packed_. However, to make all quite safe, after\r\na very wet damp day, the Teas might be re-dried for a few minutes over\r\ncharcoal before being put into their respective bins. I do not do this\r\nmyself though, and do not think it necessary.\r\n\r\nI hope now I have made the above form plain. It is in a book, and each\r\npage will hold one week. The total of the Tea made in the week is added\r\nup and shown at foot, and that amount is then transferred to the credit\r\nside of the Tea store account. Thus (see both forms) 16 maunds 32 lbs.\r\nis credited.\r\n\r\nThe form given on the next page is also kept in a book, and the total\r\nof right-hand side subtracted from the left gives at any time the\r\nquantity of Tea in store.\r\n\r\n_Tea Store Account._\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------\r\n               RECEIPTS\r\n  ------------+-----------+-----------\r\n              |  Tea made |\r\n  Week ending |  in week  |   Total\r\n  on Saturday +-----+-----+-----+-----\r\n              | Mds.| lbs.| Mds.| lbs.\r\n  ------------+-----+-----+-----+-----\r\n  Brought     |     |     |     |\r\n   over    .. |  .. |  .. | 405 |   8\r\n  October 7th |  16 |  32 |     |\r\n    „     14th|  15 |   0 |     |\r\n    „     21st|  17 |  10 |     |\r\n    „     28th|  14 |  40 |     |\r\n              |-----|-----|  63 |   2\r\n              |     |     |     |\r\n              |     |     |     |\r\n              |     |     |     |\r\n              |     |     |     |\r\n              |     |     |     |\r\n  ------------+-----+-----+-----+-----\r\n        Carried over      |     |\r\n  ------------------------+-----+-----\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n                            EXPENDITURE\r\n  -----------+--------------+-------+-----------+------------\r\n             |              |       |Tea in each|\r\n     Date    |No. of Invoice|To whom|  Invoice  |   Total\r\n             |              |       +-----+-----+-----+------\r\n             |              |       | Mds.| lbs.| Mds.| lbs.\r\n  -------+---+--------------+-------+-----+-----+-----+------\r\n         |   |              |Brought|     |     |     |\r\n         |   |              | over  |  .. |  .. | 351 |  14\r\n  October| 3 |      15      |-------|  40 |  15 |     |\r\n    „    |20 |      16      |-------|  33 |  10 |     |\r\n         |   |              |       |-----|-----|  73 |  25\r\n         |   |              |       |     |     |     |\r\n         |   |              |       |     |     |     |\r\n         |   |              |       |     |     |     |\r\n         |   |              |       |     |     |     |\r\n         |   |              |       |     |     |     |\r\n         |   |              |       |     |     |     |\r\n         |   |              |       |     |     |     |\r\n  -------+---+--------------+-------+-----+-----+-----+------\r\n                Carried over        |     |     |     |\r\n  ----------------------------------+-----+-----+-----+------\r\n\r\nRegarding accounts between the manager and his employers, I think they\r\nshould be of the simplest kind. If a man _can_ be trusted he _should_\r\nbe trusted; if he cannot, no system of accounts will restrain him, and\r\nhe should be kicked out. A simple account current, furnished monthly,\r\nshowing under few heads the receipts and expenditure, is all that can\r\nbe required. It is not by _any_ papers received from a manager that\r\nan opinion can be expressed as to how he does his work, and how the\r\nplantation progresses. A competent person visiting the garden can\r\neasily ascertain, and in default of this, and combined with this, the\r\nonly true test is the balance sheet at the end of each season.\r\n\r\nShortly, it is not by the form, the nicety, the detail of accounts\r\nbetween manager and employer, that success is ensured or even\r\nforwarded. It is, as far as accounts are concerned, by the forms and\r\n_system_ the manager adopts as between him and his subordinates, and\r\nthese he should be able to show are good to the employer, or anyone\r\ndeputed by him to visit the garden.\r\n\r\nThe profit shown yearly, whether it is large or small, all things\r\nconsidered, is, however, the only true ultimate test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nCOST OF MANUFACTURE, PACKING, TRANSPORT, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are as follow:--They will vary more or less according to the\r\ndistrict, rate of wages, &c., but in the form the tables are given, if\r\nnot suitable to any case, they can easily be made so.\r\n\r\nI have added sorting, packing, freight to Calcutta, and broker’s\r\ncharges in Calcutta, to the cost, so that all is included from the\r\nmoment the green leaf is picked off the trees till the hammer falls at\r\nthe public auction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Table cost of Manufacture, Sorting, Packing, Transport to Calcutta,\r\nand Broker’s Charges for each maund of Tea._\r\n\r\n              _Manufacture._                 RS.

See page 70, where\r\nit will be seen that each maund of Tea is worth to the manufacturer\r\n(after deducting all costs) Rs. 50.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] In practice the basket in which the leaf is measured being made to\r\nhold 2-1/2 lbs., for which a ticket is given, representing 2 pice, the\r\nleaf to make a maund of Tea does not really cost so much.\r\n\r\n[62] After experience has shown me this amount, when any quantity of\r\nTea is made, is too high--Rs. 12 to 13 would be nearer the mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nCOST OF MAKING A 300-ACRE TEA GARDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following estimate 100 acres are supposed to be planted the\r\nfirst year, 100 acres the second, and 100 acres the third.\r\n\r\nTo elucidate a table I shall draw up in the next chapter showing the\r\nprobable receipts and expenditure on such a garden for a series of\r\nyears, I shall suppose this plantation to be begun in 1875, and number\r\nthe years accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe expenditure would truly, in the supposed case, begin in the latter\r\npart of 1874, but it is more convenient to regard it as commencing 1st\r\nJanuary, 1875.\r\n\r\nI estimate all new cultivation as planted “at stake,” that is, the seed\r\nsown _in situ_. Nurseries are only to fill up vacancies.\r\n\r\nI shall not pretend in this to go into minute details, such as are\r\ngiven at page 84, for it is simply impossible to do so. The cost of\r\nmaking a plantation must vary greatly, being determined by climate,\r\navailable labour and its rates, lay of land, nature of jungle to clear,\r\n&c., &c.

It would have been very inconvenient to\r\ndo so. The cost is so much per maund of Tea, and I prefer estimating\r\nthe Tea at its market rate _minus_ the cost of manufacture shown at\r\npages 70 and 162.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[63] The cost for seed, nurseries, and transplanting increases each\r\nyear as the area over which vacancies may exist enlarges.\r\n\r\n[64] See note 63 p. 163.\r\n\r\n[65] The expenditure for planting the 100 acres each year includes\r\ncutting and clearing jungle, removing roots, digging, staking, pitting,\r\nand sowing the seed. In fact _all_ expenditure including part of the\r\npay of Manager and Establishment. The rate per acre _decreases_ each\r\nyear, because each year there is more expenditure of other kinds, which\r\nhelps to pay for the Manager and Establishment.\r\n\r\n[66] The reason why the rate for cultivation on the 100 acres planted\r\neach of the three first years increases each year is given in the table\r\nand remarks at pages 84 and 85.\r\n\r\n[67] See note 65, p. 164.\r\n\r\n[68] See note 66, p. 164.\r\n\r\n[69] The seed to be bought is now less each year, as it is produced\r\non the garden, and after the fifth year no more has to be purchased.\r\nFrom the fourth, and all subsequent years, nurseries for vacancies\r\nare calculated at Rs. 500, which is enough, as the garden has been\r\npreviously yearly replenished. This expenditure will be continual as\r\nlong as the garden lasts, for there will always be some vacancies to\r\nreplace.\r\n\r\n[70] Rupees 500 is a fair sum to estimate for ordinary annual repairs\r\nto buildings, and it will be required as long as the garden lasts. A\r\ntemporary Factory was made in 1877, and a permanent building is now\r\nallowed for in 1881. Permanent Manager’s and Assistant’s houses are\r\nalso allowed for in 1882. The garden can afford this now, for the\r\nprofits are large.

We must now ascertain how much Tea that area\r\nwill give yearly.\r\n\r\nIt is a very wide question what produce an acre of Tea will give.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from the “Report of the Commissioners\r\nappointed to enquire into the state and prospects of Tea cultivation\r\nin Assam and Cachar,” addressed to the Government of Bengal, and dated\r\nMarch, 1868:--\r\n\r\n  “_Average produce per acre._”\r\n\r\n  “The returns of actual produce of gardens in 1867 which we have\r\n  obtained are so few in number that it is impossible to take any\r\n  general average from them. The produce in these varies from\r\n  three-and-a-half maunds to one-and-a-half maunds per acre, omitting\r\n  the more recently formed gardens.\r\n\r\n  “From information received during our tour we have reason to believe\r\n  that some gardens produce more than the highest rate per acre here\r\n  mentioned; but, in the absence of returns of exact acreage and\r\n  out-turn, we cannot notice these instances.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Haworth, in his pamphlet already quoted, speaks of the produce\r\n  of Cachar gardens as follows:--\r\n\r\n  “‘I believe that three maunds per acre is fully one-third more than\r\n  the present average yield of gardens in Cachar, after deducting the\r\n  area of plant under yielding age.\r\n\r\n  “‘There is no reason, that I am aware of, why the yield of Tea should\r\n  not soon be raised to four maunds, and more gradually six maunds per\r\n  acre, equal to twenty-four maunds of leaf per acre (less than one\r\n  ton per acre for a green crop, which is still a very small one).\r\n  Even now there are gardens in Cachar which give an average of from\r\n  five to six maunds per acre this season. Some of these gardens have\r\n  really no apparent advantage over their less fortunate neighbours,\r\n  beyond that of a somewhat better system of cultivation and pruning;\r\n  and these improvements even are to such a small degree ahead of the\r\n  general practice, that I feel justified in saying I cannot place a\r\n  limit on what the increased yield should be under a more rational\r\n  system of cultivation, and the application of manures on a liberal\r\n  scale, leaving out of consideration altogether what might reasonably\r\n  be expected from a good system of drainage in addition.’\r\n\r\n  “Mr. James Stuart, Manager of the Bengal Tea Company’s gardens in\r\n  Cachar, has also given two maunds an acre as the general average of\r\n  Cachar gardens for the past season, including young gardens of two,\r\n  three, and four years old.\r\n\r\n  “We do not think it necessary to quote in detail the opinions of all\r\n  the gentlemen examined by us on the subject of average produce per\r\n  acre. A garden that can give four maunds per acre is undoubtedly a\r\n  good one, and we have no doubt there are such, or even better; but we\r\n  do not think they are so common as to warrant our taking more than\r\n  three maunds as a safe average.”\r\n\r\nMr. A. C. Campbell, Extra Assistant Commissioner at Burpettah, in his\r\n“Notes on Tea Cultivation in Assam,” published in the Journal of the\r\nAgricultural and Horticultural Society of India, part 3, vol. xii.,\r\npage 309, says:--“Good Tea land can be made to yield as high as seven\r\nmaunds per poora.” I forget exactly how much a poora is, but I believe\r\nit is nearly an acre.\r\n\r\nIn the Report to Government by the Commissioners, quoted above, at page\r\n9, Mr. T. Burland, after estimating the cost of cultivation per acre\r\nper mensem at Rs. 9-10-2, adds:--“With the above expenditure per acre\r\nit is probable that much more than five maunds of Tea will be obtained\r\nfrom an acre of fair plant.”[78]\r\n\r\nAll these estimates, however, are based on the cultivation of Tea as\r\ncarried on hitherto with few exceptions, that is to say, on gardens\r\ncovered with weeds for many months in the year, and to which no manure\r\nhas ever been given. With such cultivation, particularly on gardens\r\nplanted on slopes, I think myself that the yield will not exceed four\r\nmaunds _at the outside_.\r\n\r\nHigh cultivation and liberal manuring will, I believe, at least double\r\nthe above, if the plants are of a high class. However, here I give a\r\ntable on the subject which I have carefully framed.\r\n\r\n  _Estimate of probable yield per acre on flat land, good soil, in a\r\n  good Tea climate, and with hybrid plants, if really high cultivation\r\n  and liberal manuring is carried out._\r\n\r\n  +----+-------------+-------------------+\r\n  |Year|Supposed Year|Estimated yield per|\r\n  |    |             | acre in maunds[79]|\r\n  +----+-------------+-------------------+\r\n  | 1st|    1875     |        --         |\r\n  | 2nd|    1876     |        --         |\r\n  | 3rd|    1877     |        1/2        |\r\n  | 4th|    1878     |         2         |\r\n  | 5th|    1879[80] |         4         |\r\n  | 6th|    1880     |         5         |\r\n  | 7th|    1881     |         6         |\r\n  | 8th|    1882     |         7         |\r\n  | 9th|    1883     |       7-1/2       |\r\n  |10th|    1884[81] |         8         |\r\n  +----+-------------+-------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not think plants reach to perfect maturity under eight or ten\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThat eight maunds per acre as estimated in the table just given _can_\r\nbe realised, under the conditions stated, I have no doubt whatever, but\r\nI am equally certain that the size of some gardens in India must be\r\nmuch reduced if even five or six maunds are looked for.[82] Not only\r\nmust they be reduced in size, but they must be highly cultivated, must\r\nbe manured, and no vacancies allowed. However, I have dwelt on all\r\nthese points before, and need not repeat here, for unless the reader is\r\nconvinced before this that a large area and low cultivation won’t pay,\r\nit were waste to write more.\r\n\r\nI now give a table showing the result for twelve years of a plantation\r\nsuch as I have advised.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE ESTIMATED RESULTS FOR 12 YEARS OF A

|\r\n   table as follows:--              |\r\n  1. About Rs. 90,000 of capital    |\r\n   is necessary to make a plantation|\r\n   as quick as this. If             |\r\n   made more gradually, very        |\r\n   much less would suffice.         |\r\n  2. There is no yearly profit      |\r\n   until the fifth year.            |\r\n  3. By the eighth year all the     |\r\n   outlay is recovered.             |\r\n  This table has been prepared      |\r\n   with great care, and the         |\r\n   authority for the figures        |\r\n   assumed has been arrived         |\r\n   at in previous parts. (_See_     |\r\n   headings of the Cols. for the    |\r\n   pages and note at foot.)         |\r\n  I believe this table represents   |\r\n   truly what Tea, with             |\r\n   all the necessary advantages     |\r\n   detailed in the next             |\r\n   page, can do.                    |\r\n  ----------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n  At the following pages will be found the calculations for the figures\r\n  assumed:--Col. 2, page 170; Col. 8, pages 70 and 162; Col. 10, pages 164,\r\n  165, 166.\r\n\r\nThe necessities for success in Tea are:--\r\n\r\n  1. A good climate.\r\n\r\n  2. A good site.\r\n\r\n  3. Perfect knowledge in Tea cultivation and Tea manufacture on the\r\n  proprietor’s part or that of his manager.\r\n\r\n  4. Seed from a high class of plants.\r\n\r\n  5. Local or cheap imported labour.\r\n\r\n  6. Facilities for manuring.\r\n\r\n  7. Cheap transport.\r\n\r\nDo not dispense, though, with even _one_ of the seven points named, for\r\nthe truth is simply, that Tea will pay _very_ well with all the above\r\nadvantages, but will utterly fail without them.\r\n\r\nSuch is my advice to intending beginners. To those who have gardens, I\r\nsay, reduce your areas till of the size you can really cultivate them\r\nhighly, and procure manure at any cost.\r\n\r\nI shall not have written in vain, and Tea enterprise in India will\r\nflourish, if the motto of planters in future be--\r\n\r\n  “A full area, highly cultivated.”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[78] See my estimate for cultivation at page 84. I there estimate Rs.\r\n100 per acre per annum from the sixth year, so that Mr. Burland six\r\nyears ago had come to the same opinion about high cultivation that I\r\nhold.\r\n\r\n[79] Calculating Tea by maunds is convenient, inasmuch as pounds\r\nnecessitate such lengthy figures for all calculations. The maund here\r\nemployed is, however, quite an arbitrary measure. It is _not_ the\r\nIndian maund, it equals and is represented exactly by 80 lbs. Any\r\nnumber of maunds multiplied by 80 will naturally give the lbs. of Tea.\r\n\r\n[80] Up to this point, viz., the fifth year inclusive, the figures\r\ngiven have been much more than realised, and that on a garden with\r\n15 per cent. vacancies. It has been, though, highly cultivated and\r\nliberally manured from the first.\r\n\r\n[81] From the fifth to the tenth year is assumption, except that I know\r\none garden which, to my certain knowledge, has given _more_ then ten\r\nmaunds an acre, and this in spite of about 15 per cent. vacancies. The\r\ngarden is an old one, planted about 18 years ago. It is also a very\r\nsmall one. The soil is _very_ poor, but the plants are of the highest\r\nclass. It was much neglected till about eight years ago. From that\r\ntime it has been highly cultivated in every way except in the point of\r\nirrigation, for it has not that advantage. It has been _most_ liberally\r\nmanured.\r\n\r\n[82] Note to Third Edition.--With high cultivation on a favourable site\r\nand in a really good Tea climate, I now believe 10 maunds per acre will\r\neventually be realised.\r\n\r\n[83] With interest, _see_ pages 164 and 165.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nPAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF INDIAN TEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few words on the past, the present, and the future of Indian Tea will\r\nnow conclude this Essay, and will, I hope, be acceptable to the reader.\r\n\r\nThe subject is one of growing importance, but being a new one, there\r\nare points connected with it on which the public are very ignorant, and\r\nshould be enlightened.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the following facts are not disputed by those who know\r\nanything of the subject:--\r\n\r\n1. Indian Teas have far more body, that is strength, than Chinese Teas.\r\n\r\n2. Indian Teas consequently command a higher price at the London sales\r\nthan Chinese Teas.\r\n\r\n3. In spite of its higher price, it is far more economical than the\r\nChinese produce, as, generally speaking, one-third of the quantity\r\nsuffices.\r\n\r\n4. There are lands enough in India to grow all the Tea required for\r\nEngland’s use, and, indeed, for all her colonies.\r\n\r\nIf these _are_ facts, and I confidentially affirm they are so, how is\r\nit that the following holds in England?\r\n\r\n1. Indian Tea is not known to the public.\r\n\r\n2. Except in one or two shops in London and Glasgow, unknown to the\r\nmass of the people, not an ounce of pure Indian Tea can be bought in\r\nall England.\r\n\r\n3. That India is even a Tea-producing country is scarcely known in\r\nEngland.[84]\r\n\r\nI think I can explain some of these anomalies.\r\n\r\nTea is an acquired taste: by which I mean, not only that the adult who\r\nhad never tasted Tea would not like it when first offered to him, but\r\nalso that, with those who consume it regularly, any Tea that differs in\r\nflavour from what is habitually drunk is not relished.\r\n\r\nIt matters not whether it is intrinsically better or worse, enough that\r\nthe flavour is different, for that reason it is not liked.\r\n\r\nIndian Tea differs widely from Chinese Tea, and for that reason is\r\nrarely appreciated by those accustomed to the latter.\r\n\r\nFor a long time it appeared as if this difficulty would be a bar to the\r\ngeneral introduction of Indian Teas in England, and so indeed it would\r\nhave proved, had the short-sighted policy adopted at the commencement\r\nby one or two Indian Companies that their Teas should be sold retail\r\nand pure, that is, unmixed with Chinese, been followed out. It did not\r\navail to tell John Bull it was better Tea, that it was far stronger,\r\nthat it was in no way adulterated; for he simply shook his head, the\r\nflavour was different to what use had made him familiar with, and he\r\nwould none of it.\r\n\r\nBut little by little, in spite of the above, it made its way. Grocers\r\nsoon found that the worst, _id est_, the weakest class of Chinese Teas\r\nreceived _body_ and were made saleable by an addition of Indian Tea.\r\nIt was not long after this that the trade discovered that pretty well\r\n_all_ Chinese Teas were improved, if proportions of Indian Teas were\r\nmixed with them. In short, the fact was recognised by Tea vendors that\r\nChinese Teas were weak, and much improved if mixed with Indian.\r\n\r\nThe public were thus _educated_ to relish the superior flavour of\r\nIndian Tea, and did so, when the quantity mixed with the Chinese was\r\nnot so great as to make the new flavour too _prononcé_. Little by\r\nlittle the custom of so mixing became very general, so much so that it\r\nmay almost be said to-day that if Indian Teas cannot be purchased pure,\r\nno more can Chinese. A mixture of Chinese and Indian Tea, the latter\r\nsmall as compared with the former, is what is now generally used in\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nThis is the case to-day. What will it be in the future?\r\n\r\nAs the English palate is educated to like the flavour of Indian Tea,\r\nmore and more of it will be demanded in the mixture made up for the\r\npublic, and though the day is distant, nay, may never arrive, on\r\naccount of its greater cost, when it will be generally drunk pure, I do\r\nnot myself doubt that the demand for it will go on steadily increasing\r\nfor years to come, as it has for years past.[85]\r\n\r\nIt is an important query if, with a largely increased demand, the\r\nsupply will be equal to it. Very far from all India has a good Tea\r\nclimate, which is a peculiar one, and only exists in perfection in\r\nAssam, Cachar, Chittagong, and lands in Bengal close to the foot of the\r\nHimalayas.\r\n\r\nBut in these districts alone there are lands sufficient to supply\r\nnearly the whole world with Tea, so that it is not the lands which are\r\nwanting, though the Government prices for the lands are prohibitory and\r\nwill check cultivation. But in Assam, Cachar, and the Terai below the\r\nHimalayas labour is very scarce, while in Chittagong the area fit for\r\nTea is not large, so that I do not anticipate any very sudden increase\r\nof the cultivation, though year by year it is on the increase and will\r\nso continue.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I do not--for the reasons stated, viz., that\r\nTea is an acquired taste and thus a new kind is not at first\r\npalatable--anticipate any very sudden increase in the demand. If,\r\nhowever, I am wrong, and from a largely increased demand the prices of\r\nIndian Teas rise, I do not doubt that the cultivation will be greatly\r\nextended, and that after an interval of four years (it takes that time\r\nfor the Tea plant to produce) the supply will be equal to the then\r\nwants of the English market.\r\n\r\nThe future of Indian Tea is, I think, a bright one, and I know nothing\r\nin which capital can be more profitably invested if the business is\r\nconducted with knowledge and experience, but to embark in it without\r\nthese two requisites is ruin.\r\n\r\nA few figures may be given here. The imports into Great Britain of\r\nIndian Teas have been yearly increasing, till in 1873 they amounted to\r\n18,367,000 lbs., and, judging from the estimate out here of the produce\r\nthis year, viz., 1874, the imports into Great Britain in 1874 will not\r\nbe far short of 20,000,000 lbs.[86]\r\n\r\nBut as the annual consumption of Tea in the United Kingdom is not less\r\nthan 130,000,000 lbs., India is still very far from supplying enough to\r\ngive a mixture of three-fourths Chinese and one-fourth India Tea.[87]\r\n\r\nThe finest Chinese Tea sells in London in bond at 2_s._ 4_d._ to 2_s._\r\n6_d._, while the finest Indian in bond fetches 3_s._ to 3_s._ 6_d._[88]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, will be the future of Indian Tea? It is an important query.\r\nThe industry is one which, if successful, might attain to wide limits,\r\nand help not a little to relieve the Indian State Exchequer, while it\r\nwould afford occupation to many a class of Englishmen who at present\r\nlook about in vain for employment.\r\n\r\nTea speculation has passed through the first two preliminary phases\r\nto which most new ventures are liable. First, we had the wild rush,\r\nthe mad fever, when every man thought that to own a few Tea bushes\r\nwas to realise wealth. In those days existing plantations were bought\r\nat eight and ten times their value; nominal areas of 500 acres were\r\npaid for which, on subsequent measurement, proved to be under 100; new\r\ngardens were commenced on impossible sites, and by men as managers who\r\nnot only did not know a Tea plant from a cabbage, but who were equally\r\nignorant of the commonest rules of agriculture. Boards highly paid,\r\nwith secretaries still more liberally remunerated, were formed both in\r\nCalcutta and London to carry on the enterprise; and, in short, money\r\nwas lavished in every conceivable way, while mismanagement ran rampant\r\nin each department. It is not strange that the whole thing collapsed:\r\nthe wonder is it did not do so earlier.\r\n\r\nThe second stage was then entered upon. Numbers had been bitten, and\r\nthe idea, once formed, grew apace, that Tea could not pay at all.\r\nEveryone wanted to sell, and down went all Tea shares to a figure\r\nwhich only increased the general panic. Many companies, and not a few\r\nindividuals, unable to carry on, had to wind up and sell their estates\r\nfor whatever they would fetch. Gardens that had cost lakhs were sold\r\nfor as many hundreds, and the very word “Tea” stank in the nostrils of\r\nthe commercial public. A few of the best companies held on, as also\r\nsuch individuals embarked in the speculation as could weather the\r\nstorm; but some of the companies were bowed down with heavy debts, and\r\nit has been with many, from that cause, a losing race ever since.\r\n\r\nThis great smash occurred in 1867. I purpose, therefore, to examine\r\ninto the future prospects of the industry, now that time has been given\r\nto test its vitality. Naturally the mistakes made at the first have not\r\nbeen repeated since, so the speculation has had more or less of a fair\r\nchance to show what it can do.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the share list of Tea companies in the public\r\nprints does not at all represent the true position of Tea property\r\nto-day. It only gives the dividends declared and the value of the\r\nshares in those few limited liability companies which were able to\r\nweather the storm, but who, in common with all the others, were bowed\r\ndown with debt, and are suffering up to the present time, both from\r\nthat and the numberless mistakes made at the commencement of the\r\nenterprise. There are a few notable exceptions, even among the Tea\r\ncompanies. Some of these have done very well, pay large dividends, and\r\nare quoted at a high premium, which shows that Tea can and will pay\r\neven with the disadvantages attached to limited liability companies.\r\nI mean that in these latter work is always expensively done, and that\r\nmuch of the profits are swallowed up by secretaries, directors, &c.,\r\nbesides which, generally from interested motives, the Teas are sent\r\nhome for sale which private planters know from experience is _not_ the\r\nbest plan.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the share list. The very many gardens held by firms\r\nor private individuals are absent, and inasmuch as many of these were\r\nbegun more lately, and consequently, the blunders made in other gardens\r\nwere avoided, it is evident that _their_ position, if it could be\r\nascertained, would give the true picture needed.\r\n\r\nThere is one class of plantations which it would be by no means fair to\r\ninclude. I mean those gardens bought for a mere song during the panic.\r\nOn many of these necessarily enormous profits have been made, but it\r\nproves nothing, inasmuch as the profits, to be legitimate profits for\r\ncriticism, should on the debit side include the whole cost incurred in\r\nmaking the plantation. To form a fair appreciation of the profits Tea\r\nplanting can give, we must select gardens constructed after knowledge\r\non the subject was attained, where good management, combined with\r\neconomy in all details, has been carried out, and where the necessary\r\nnatural conditions for success exist--and such are rare.\r\n\r\nBut first let me explain what I mean by the “necessary natural\r\nconditions for success.” Manageable areas; flat or nearly flat land\r\nfor the garden; a good class of indigenous and hybrid plants; local\r\nlabour, or anyhow a good proportion of this; facilities for manuring; a\r\ngood soil; a good Tea climate; and cheap means of transport constitute\r\nthese, and where they exist I hold Tea _must_, and _does_, pay well. I\r\ndon’t believe in plantations of 600 or 800 acres; some of these pay,\r\nbut they would pay much better if reduced in size. A garden of 300\r\nacres, yielding even at the rate of four maunds an acre, will pay much\r\nbetter than another of 500 acres, yielding but two and a-half or three\r\nmaunds.\r\n\r\nThe reason is obvious, the larger produce is against a smaller\r\nexpenditure. Were I to commence a Tea plantation to-day, it should\r\nnot exceed 300 or 400 acres in size. This passion for large areas is\r\nthe rock on which, more than any other, Tea Companies have wrecked\r\nthemselves; experience has already shown this, and will show it more,\r\nas time goes on.\r\n\r\nFlat land for Tea gardens is a great desideratum. Steep lands are\r\ndifficult to cultivate; the soil is continually washing away from the\r\nroots of the plants; it is impossible to manure them successfully, and\r\nthe consequence of all this is that the Tea bushes do not thrive.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese plant gives a small and inferior produce, the indigenous\r\nand hybrid kind a larger and very superior one; thus I think the latter\r\none of the “necessary conditions for success.” On the other points,\r\nwith the exception of manuring, nothing need be said, inasmuch as\r\ntheir necessity is evident; but on the point of manure I must say a\r\nfew words. The Tea plant is being continually denuded of its leaves;\r\nnothing is returned to the soil; and consequently in process of\r\ntime that soil is exhausted. It was held once that manure destroyed\r\nthe flavour of Tea. This idea, at variance with all agricultural\r\nexperience, is now completely exploded, like many others received from\r\nthe Chinamen who first came from the Flowery Land to teach the art of\r\nTea cultivation and Tea manufacture to the Indian public. Many of them\r\nhad never perhaps seen a Tea bush, anyhow in many respects theirs was\r\nfaulty teaching, and all experienced planters are convinced, and it is\r\ntruth, that more knowledge on Tea exists in India than China at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the subject of manure. It is, and is now generally\r\nallowed to be, a necessity to the lengthened and successful maintenance\r\nof a plantation. Means for its production are now largely adopted in\r\nAssam and Cachar, and the results will be a yield per acre the most\r\nsanguine have never dreamt of. Chittagong, on this head, has great\r\nadvantages; manure in any quantity can there be procured for a trifle,\r\nand the results have shown its great value.\r\n\r\nWe have scarcely yet entered on the third stage to which any new\r\nspeculation, after the two first (the wild venture, and the unreasoning\r\npanic have passed), tends; but as knowledge of the financial results of\r\nTea plantations in the hands of private firms and private individuals\r\nincreases, that third stage will dawn, if it has not done so already.\r\nIt consists in a sober appreciation of the subject opposed to both the\r\nextremely exulting and depressing views passed through, and when it\r\narrives, the great and successful future of Indian Tea will be only a\r\nquestion of time.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[84] Note to Third Edition.--The above three statements, quite true\r\nwhen written, are not so now. The heavy fall in the value of both\r\nIndian and Chinese Teas in 1877, while pressing hard on the Indian\r\nproducer, has certainly had the one good effect for him of making\r\nIndian Teas more widely known. They _are_ generally known now, in many\r\ncases sold pure as Indian Tea, and used by all retail dealers to give\r\nthe body, or strength lacking in most Chinese kinds.\r\n\r\n[85] Note to Third Edition.--Yes; the demand has largely increased,\r\nbut, alas! production has increased in a greater ratio. In short, the\r\nsupply exceeds the demand, and hence the low prices now ruling. As\r\nregards the use of Indian Teas, so much have the English public been\r\nnow made familiar with their flavour, they, as a rule, reject any Teas\r\nwhich have it not more or less. In fact, the English public, as I\r\npredicted years ago, have now begun to like the new flavour, and even\r\npure Indian Teas are now relished by many.\r\n\r\n[86] Note to Third Edition.--The imports have been as follows during\r\nthe last three years:--\r\n\r\n  1875           25,615,000.\r\n  1876           29,384,000.\r\n  1877           31,882,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n[87] Note to Third Edition.--The annual consumption of all Teas in\r\nGreat Britain in 1877 was:--\r\n\r\n  Chinese       158,000,000\r\n  India          28,000,000\r\n                -----------\r\n  Total         186,000,000\r\n\r\n\r\n[88] Note to Third Edition.--In 1876 the _average_ prices of the two\r\nkinds in bond were:--Chinese, 1_s._ 2_d._; Indian, 1_s._ 10_d._ per lb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ADDITIONS TO THE FOURTH EDITION._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nCOUNTRIES OUTSIDE CHINA AND INDIA THAT PRODUCE TEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much has the industry marched since the Third Edition was published\r\nin 1878 that I think it well to add the following pages to my book.\r\n\r\nI will first consider the countries _outside_ India and China which\r\nproduce Tea, or wish to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEYLON.\r\n\r\nThis is likely to prove a formidable competitor. As far as I can\r\ngather, Tea plants (of both the Assam and China kinds) were introduced\r\ninto Ceylon in 1841, but it is only during the last few years Tea\r\nplanting has been taken up in earnest. A Mr. Shand, who seems to have\r\nstudied Tea in Ceylon, estimates 500 lbs. per acre as the produce when\r\nin full bearing. This is 6-1/4 maunds, and though less than the best\r\nIndian gardens give, it is considerably above the average all over\r\nIndia. Ceylon Tea finds a ready market in London. The parcels vary\r\nmuch, as they do from India, but in the past year (1882) many very\r\ndesirable lots were sent home. I believe, take it all in all, Ceylon\r\nTea is no better, and no worse, than Indian Tea.\r\n\r\nWith Tea prices as they are to-day, I would not myself _commence_ Tea\r\ncultivation in India, Ceylon, or _anywhere_. I feel sure, therefore,\r\nif Ceylon planters rush into Tea, as they did in India in times past,\r\nthey will regret it. But I hear that made Tea gardens can be bought\r\nthere cheap, and under these circumstances Tea will probably pay the\r\npurchasers well.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHORE.\r\n\r\nH.H. the Maharajah there has started a small Tea garden, but as there\r\nare in it only two acres of Tea, the whole thing is quite an experiment\r\nyet. The climate is said to be favourable, and land easily acquired.\r\nCheap labour is the difficulty. May it long continue so! There is too\r\nmuch Tea already; the low prices ruling result simply from supply\r\nexceeding demand. Thus I hope Johore will _not_ produce Tea. The\r\nfollowing is from the _Tea Gazette_:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  TEA IN JOHORE.\r\n\r\n  We have lately published several articles on the subject of Tea in\r\n  Johore and the prospects of Tea plantations in the Malay Peninsula.\r\n  The soil and climate are all that can be desired for the successful\r\n  cultivation of the Tea plant; there is abundance of land lying\r\n  idle which can be obtained on advantageous terms; but all hopes of\r\n  establishing the Tea industry on a prosperous footing are frustrated\r\n  by the want of cheap Indian labour. A correspondent writes on this\r\n  subject to the _Ceylon Observer_ as follows:--\r\n\r\n  “I was pretty well disgusted with Johore at first. I got such fever\r\n  as nearly finished me up twice. A new comer from Ceylon says he had\r\n  Wellawaya fever and all other fevers in Ceylon, but he never felt\r\n  anything to come near the severity of Johore fever. Liberian coffee\r\n  does first-class in the low country. Cocoa is being tried with\r\n  apparent success. Tea is also promising. You may have seen about some\r\n  samples sold in London, at a high figure. All this is nice enough,\r\n  but what’s the good of it when we have not a plentiful supply of\r\n  labour over which we can have complete control? So you see, the\r\n  burden of my letter is an indefinite supply of labour.”\r\n\r\n  Strenuous efforts are, however, being made to arrange with the\r\n  Government for the importation of labourers from this country, which,\r\n  if successful, will inevitably result in the cultivation on a large\r\n  scale of the Tea plant in Johore. In another column will be found a\r\n  description of the Maharajah of Johore’s experimental Tea plantation\r\n  at Tanjong Putri, Johore.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPAN.\r\n\r\nSends its Teas principally to America. The Tea is of a greenish nature,\r\nand experiments to manufacture black Tea have not, it seems, been\r\nsuccessful. The following should give a hope to Indian Tea planters:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  JAPAN TEA.\r\n\r\n  To the Editor of the _Japan Herald_.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir,--I read your article on Tea contained in last Saturday’s\r\n  paper, anent the deterioration in quality of one of the country’s\r\n  principal articles of export, and can fully confirm the chief points\r\n  contained therein.\r\n\r\n  But in addition, from my personal experience, there appears to exist\r\n  a steadily increasing disregard of care in the preparation of the\r\n  leaf up country, and the evil, though existing for the last three\r\n  or four years, is much more manifest this season, and is worthy of\r\n  being brought under the especial notice of parties interested in the\r\n  welfare of this country’s produce.\r\n\r\n  I submit for your inspection a sample of coarse leaf sifted out of\r\n  a parcel of good quality, and the proportion of similar stuff in\r\n  the chop amounts to fully 3 per cent., very much affecting the good\r\n  appearance of the fired leaf. This defect no doubt arises from the\r\n  attempted production of too great an amount of cured leaf for each\r\n  hand employed per diem in the process, to be attributed no doubt\r\n  to the enhanced cost of labour in the interior. But the defect is\r\n  of vital importance for the future of Japan Teas in America. The\r\n  buyer for distribution amongst consumers in that country is greatly\r\n  influenced by the “appearance” of the leaf, despite its relative\r\n  intrinsic quality in infusion, in comparison with a Tea of worse\r\n  appearance, hence the high facing and colouring at present so much\r\n  in vogue. If the Japanese producers continue the present style of\r\n  manufacturing the leaf up country, so surely will Japan Teas decline\r\n  in favour in America, as the foreign shipper here cannot make up the\r\n  leaf prepared up country to the standard required by the American\r\n  buyers, and with the prospect of a possibility of Oolongs and even\r\n  blacks becoming ere long dangerous rivals with consumers in the\r\n  United States, it behoves the Japanese Tea growers to turn their\r\n  attention towards an improvement in production in their own country\r\n  before they attempt to rival foreign competitors at this side.--Yours\r\n  faithfully,\r\n\r\n          YAMATO.\r\n\r\n  Yokohama, _Aug. 19, 1881_.\r\n\r\n  [We have inspected the sample of coarse leaf referred to in the above\r\n  letter, and though we cannot pretend to any critical knowledge of\r\n  Tea, we can confirm the statements of our correspondent, and hold the\r\n  specimen at our office, where it can be seen by anyone desirous of\r\n  doing so.--_Editor, Japan Herald._]\r\n\r\nI know not where this next extract came from, but it appears they\r\nunderstand adulteration in Japan:--\r\n\r\n  Mr. Yanagiya might, however, have gone a step farther, and have given\r\n  particulars of the various analyses, and have mentioned that the\r\n  “leaf” of the various samples showed a large proportion of leaves\r\n  quite different to those of the Tea shrub, and for the presence\r\n  of which not even the astute foreigner--that bugbear of Japanese\r\n  commerce--can be held accountable.\r\n\r\n  We have heard this season loud complaints of the presence of leaves\r\n  entirely distinct from those of the Tea plant amongst purchases.\r\n  These consisted principally of wisteria, willow and a species of ash,\r\n  but the native growers were impartial, and several other species of\r\n  shrubs also contributed their quota to the frauds practised by the\r\n  Japanese.\r\n\r\n  The probable reason of the falling off in the quantity of one of the\r\n  leading articles of export from Japan is not difficult to guess at,\r\n  nor can the Japanese say that they have not received full and timely\r\n  warning of the danger threatening the popularity of Japan Tea. A\r\n  reckless over-production, excessive and close picking of the shrubs,\r\n  and great carelessness in pruning and manuring the tree--caused,\r\n  no doubt, in no small degree by the high rate of wages in the\r\n  interior--is militating against the realisation of a good crop,\r\n  and the peasant is too intent upon immediate profits to forego the\r\n  picking of the third crop of a season under existing circumstances.\r\n  The result of all this has been that--at the close of last season--a\r\n  quantity of worthless leaf was poured upon the market, finally sold\r\n  at almost nominal figures, and shipped across to the United States,\r\n  where it remains an incubus on the figures of stock, and a source\r\n  of future abhorrence to any unfortunate purchaser towards anything\r\n  bearing the name of Japan Tea.\r\n\r\nThe following is from the report of the Japanese Consul at San\r\nFrancisco. I should have thought the Americans were too sensible “to\r\nprefer coloured Teas:”\r\n\r\n  It has however come to my knowledge that in the Eastern States the\r\n  Tea was analyzed, and adulteration was discovered; such as the\r\n  admixture of other leaves and poisonous ingredients which are used\r\n  for colouring the Tea before it is exported, and that the markets\r\n  in the Eastern States being overstocked, no Tea, unless of the best\r\n  quality, can find purchasers. This is a very deplorable state of\r\n  affairs. The colouring is made by the foreign merchants residing\r\n  in Japan, for Americans prefer coloured Tea, and a few Japanese\r\n  merchants may have imitated them, and exported on their own account.\r\n\r\nThe exports of Japan Tea to America have declined from seventeen to\r\nfourteen million in one year! Not strange if all the above is true.\r\n\r\nThe following from the _Tea Gazette_ bears out what I say above as to\r\nJapan black Tea:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  JAPAN BLACK TEA.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Consul Euslie writes from Kanagawa (Japan) as follows concerning\r\n  black Tea:--This has, on the whole, proved a failure, although the\r\n  production continues on a limited scale. The climate and soil of this\r\n  country appear unfitted to the growth of plants producing a leaf of\r\n  the quality necessary to make good black. Teas resembling good leaf\r\n  congous can be made with good and even handsome leaf, several samples\r\n  being in appearance very similar to Indian Teas of pekoe class,\r\n  but lacking strength, and not being nearly equal to good Chinese\r\n  Foochow Teas in that respect. A small amount of these Teas has been\r\n  shipped to Germany on native account, a German financier providing\r\n  the necessary funds; but thus far the outcome of these shipments has\r\n  not transpired. The results generally of 1881 have not proved as\r\n  satisfactory as those of the preceding year; the whole crop, and more\r\n  particularly the first picking, shows signs of hasty and careless\r\n  preparation. The amount of Tea exported from Japan was decidedly\r\n  in excess of the requirements of the United States and Canada, and\r\n  a considerable portion of the shipments for the year had to be\r\n  sacrificed at prices which did not cover laying down cost.\r\n\r\nAll this is hopeful for our Indian Teas, as we _can_ manufacture the\r\ngreenish Tea they like--that is, we can do it if they won’t take our\r\nblack, but they have begun to do so.\r\n\r\nThe above mode of manufacture in Japan is new to us in India.\r\n\r\n  The process of steaming the Tea is as follows:--As soon as picked\r\n  it is at once steamed, all damp or wet leaves being thrown on one\r\n  side, excepting those that may be a little wet with dew. In order\r\n  to obtain the proper application of heat, a few leaves are put into\r\n  a shallow basket, spread out evenly, and the lid put on; the basket\r\n  is then placed over a charcoal fire box or stove, a perfume is at\r\n  once perceived. When the greeny smell has subsided, the leaves are\r\n  removed, spread on a piece of new matting, and fanned briskly so as\r\n  to draw out the heat. After the lapse of some little time the Tea is\r\n  placed in a tray, and then undergoes a firing process, the length of\r\n  which is regulated either by the minute hand of a watch or the beats\r\n  of a pulse, and depends a good deal on the manipulator’s own ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAVA.[89]\r\n\r\nMuch of this Tea goes to Holland and Northern Germany. I know\r\nTea cultivation in Java is carried out very carefully and very\r\nsuccessfully, but this one fact is all I know as to Java or its Teas.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA.\r\n\r\nThat the proper climate for Tea can be found there (a huge Continent to\r\nchoose from!) goes without saying. But equally sure is it that Tea will\r\nnot pay except labour is cheap.\r\n\r\nBy the extract below, it appears Georgia has been selected for\r\nexperimental Tea cultivation, and I doubt not it is a good selection:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  TEA PLANTING IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n  Successful experiments have been made in this branch of cultivation\r\n  in the United States, as is shown by a report just published by\r\n  Mr. Jackson, a Scotch gentleman now settled in America, who was at\r\n  one time manager of the estates of the Scottish Assam Company. The\r\n  Commissioner of Agriculture has, at Mr. Jackson’s advice, selected\r\n  a tract of land in Georgia for an experimental farm, on which the\r\n  raising of Tea on an extended scale will be carefully and thoroughly\r\n  tried. Samples of the Teas already produced by Mr. Jackson have been\r\n  sent to Messrs. Thompson, tea merchants, Mincing Lane, London, to be\r\n  examined. The reply was that--“They represented Teas of a high type.\r\n  The flavour, though not strong, is remarkably fragrant. In appearance\r\n  they resemble Indian Tea, but the flavour is more like that of the\r\n  finest Chinese black Tea, or of the hill Teas of India.”\r\n\r\nNo reason why the Teas should not be good, but the labour difficulty\r\nwill, I think, prevent Tea paying there, as elsewhere in America, for\r\nMr. Jackson himself, who continues the above, asks further on, “Can we\r\nafford to pay our labourers four times as much as they pay in India and\r\nstill make Tea a success?” He, strange to say, tries to prove “yes.” I\r\nsay no, a thousand times no, in spite of all Mr. Jackson says. I like,\r\nhowever, to give both sides of a question, and so will let Mr. Jackson\r\nspeak for himself:--\r\n\r\n  The stock cry continually raised against Tea culture in this country\r\n  is, how can you raise Tea in a country where wages are so high?\r\n  You can cultivate Tea at a profit only in a country where labour\r\n  is at the lowest possible minimum, and so on. And so it is taken\r\n  for granted that the Tea culture is to be allowed to retain its\r\n  antiquated forms and systems for all time, and that the skill and\r\n  intelligence of a civilized nation can do nothing to raise it to a\r\n  level with corresponding branches of agriculture, such, for instance,\r\n  as rice growing. What would the people of South Carolina say if\r\n  told that the only way to cultivate rice at a profit was to sow all\r\n  their seed in nursery beds and, when sprouted, to transplant their\r\n  entire crop, seed by seed, by hand, as is done in India? What would\r\n  a Minnesota farmer say if told that the only implement with which\r\n  he could profitably rear a crop of corn was the hoe, wielded by an\r\n  attenuated skeleton of a man? If the hundreds of wealthy Tea planters\r\n  in Assam were told that they must return to the original system of\r\n  manufacturing their Teas by hand, they would throw up their farms in\r\n  despair. Seventy million pounds of Tea are now annually manufactured\r\n  by machinery in India and Java, and I have satisfied myself that\r\n  green Teas, suitable for the American market, can be manufactured at\r\n  one-third the cost of the black Teas prepared by machinery for the\r\n  English market. There is but one division of Tea culture into which\r\n  the labour question would enter at all, and that is the picking of\r\n  the leaves. Everything else can be carried on with the mechanical\r\n  precision of the cultivator, reaper, and floutring mill. Is not the\r\n  real truth of the matter to be found in the fact that the American\r\n  people know nothing--absolutely nothing--of the modern system of Tea\r\n  culture and manufacture, and are therefore in no position to form a\r\n  sound judgment of the possibilities of their country and countrymen\r\n  in regard to Tea? I say again, as I have often said before, that the\r\n  question of labour will prove no barrier to successful Tea culture\r\n  in America. Let any who are interested enough in this subject to\r\n  feel sceptical about it favour me with a call at No. 229 East Fourth\r\n  Street and I will take pleasure in showing them what achievements\r\n  modern skill and mechanical genius have already attained and what may\r\n  very easily be accomplished in America. I believe that then there is\r\n  a bright future in store for successful Tea culture.\r\n\r\nIn another place Mr. Jackson says he has always cultivated with\r\nploughs, and done it successfully. Naturally this would make his\r\ncultivation much cheaper, and it is high time, as I say elsewhere, that\r\nwe in India should try and do the same thing.\r\n\r\nWe, all the world knows, how ingenious, how inventive the Americans\r\nare, and thus it is _possible_ they may by the use of machinery for\r\nall branches of manufacture, by improved steam-ploughs and other\r\nagricultural instruments which shall dispense with hand labour for\r\ncultivation, so cheapen the cost of Tea that its production will pay\r\nin spite of the high rate of wages ruling. Only in this way, however,\r\n_can_ the industry succeed in America, and if it be done (I hope it\r\nmay, for we in India shall then benefit by the ideas carried out), the\r\nUnited States will add one more laurel to the many they have achieved\r\nalready in other branches of commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATAL.\r\n\r\nTea here too! Where, alas! is it not? The following is in a report from\r\nNatal:--\r\n\r\n  We have glanced at the past and seen the present condition of the\r\n  Tea enterprise. The most important matter is still before us--the\r\n  future of Tea in Natal. It must be remembered that an industry may\r\n  be profitable to encourage for local consumption, and yet fail when\r\n  it comes to be exported. This production (Tea) must be looked at as\r\n  one which, if it progresses, must shortly be exported. Three hundred\r\n  acres of Tea in full bearing will supply to the full the present need\r\n  of the Colony and its surroundings, _i.e._, taking the import returns\r\n  as our guide; and even with increasing demand, that demand can soon\r\n  be met. Therefore the importance attaching to the question, “Can\r\n  we in Natal grow Tea to pay, so as to compete with other countries\r\n  in the markets of the world?” The Tea-growing districts of India,\r\n  till lately confined to Assam, Cachar, and neighbourhood, have now\r\n  been extended to the Neilgherries and Ceylon, and these places,\r\n  till lately confining themselves to coffee, are leaving that most\r\n  precarious crop and growing Tea and cinchona. Both these districts\r\n  at present export Tea to England. It is said that Tea is to be\r\n  introduced into Queensland and the northern territory of Australia;\r\n  and that the Southern States of the Union and California contemplate\r\n  Tea growing. Are we justified, then, in believing that Tea may be\r\n  profitably exported from Natal? Before considering this, we have\r\n  to bear in mind that Tea is placed in the London market in large\r\n  quantities at a very low price; China Teas as low as 5-1/2_d._ per\r\n  lb. in bond, and Indian Teas as low as 8_d._ per lb. in bond; but\r\n  again the price extends to 3_s._ and even 4_s._ per lb. in bond. All\r\n  these things have to be weighed and well considered by anyone before\r\n  embarking in this enterprise to any great extent. In all matters of\r\n  agriculture the labour question is the foremost, after it is known\r\n  that the plant will flourish. To attempt to base the success of this\r\n  particular industry upon any other than that of coolie labour would\r\n  be foolish, as we all know that Kafirs are not to be relied upon;\r\n  therefore the cost of labour has to be considered. We well know\r\n  that all the Tea estates of India have to be supplied with imported\r\n  coolies--the natives of the districts concerned will not work unless\r\n  casually--but the cost of coolies in Natal must be more than the\r\n  cost of coolies in Assam--therefore in that item the advantage must\r\n  be in favour of the Indian planter. Countries such as Queensland\r\n  and the United States of America must either import labour, or pay\r\n  a much higher rate than we do; hence so far as these countries are\r\n  concerned, Natal will hold its own.\r\n\r\nI have not done yet. Here is another place where it seems they mean to\r\ntry Tea. I do hope that climate, soil, labour, something will be found\r\nunsuitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FIJI TEA.\r\n\r\n  Mr. J. E. Mason, of the Alpha Tea and Coffee Estate, Taviuni, Fiji,\r\n  has forwarded to Mr. J. O. Moody, the expert, of Melbourne, samples\r\n  of the first Fijian Tea produced in his part of the world; at the\r\n  same time writing that early next year he hoped to pluck off 30 acres\r\n  planted with Tea, and that the samples sent were hastily made in a\r\n  barrel with a frying-pan of charcoal. Mr. J. O. Moody reports:--“Fiji\r\n  Pekoe leaf: Handsome, small, even, golden tipped, evenly and well\r\n  fermented. Fiji Pekoe liquor: Very strong, full, rich, and pungent\r\n  pekoe flavour, thick, with deep red infusion. An invaluable Tea for\r\n  mixing, and worth about 2_s._ 6_d._ per lb. in bond. Fiji Pekoe\r\n  Souchong leaf: Well made, wiry, twisted, rich, black tippy leaf,\r\n  evenly and well fermented Fiji Pekoe Souchong flavour, with good,\r\n  bright, red infusion. A fine Tea to drink alone, and worth about\r\n  1_s._ 9_d._ per lb. in bond. These Teas have the character of good\r\n  Ceylon growths, and are in every respect suitable Teas for general\r\n  consumption, and such samples are sure to meet with ready sale in\r\n  Australasia or Great Britain.”\r\n\r\nHere again, I am told, the labour question is the doubtful point. Tea\r\ncannot be made to pay without cheap labour, and the sooner all these\r\nnew Tea countries learn the lesson the better for the pockets of the\r\nprojectors. I may add, the better for the Indian planter’s pocket too,\r\nfor _any_ increase in the supply is hurtful.\r\n\r\nIn closing this chapter, I would give one word of advice to intending\r\nTea planters in India, or indeed anywhere. There is too much Tea\r\nalready, why plant more? If you must “go into Tea” you may do so and\r\nprobably make money, but it will not be by _planting_ it. If you look\r\nabout you can buy a plantation ready made for far less than you could\r\nmake such, and in doing so there is no reason why it should not pay,\r\nand pay well. If you make a garden you will have five or six years to\r\nwait for any return; you attempt what requires knowledge and experience\r\nto succeed in, and begging your success, who can say what the market\r\nwill be then?\r\n\r\nI have far from exhausted the subject of these new Tea fields, but my\r\nspace is limited, and several other points demand attention.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[89] Much about Java and its Teas can be found in a book entitled\r\n“Java, or How to Manage a Colony,” by J. W. B. Money. Crown 8vo, 2\r\nvols. Hurst and Blackett.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS REGARDING INDIAN TEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs early as 1780 a few Chinese plants were to be seen in Calcutta\r\ncultivated by a Colonel Kyd.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of cultivating Tea in India was first mooted in\r\n1835-36, and the Indian Government started an experimental garden at\r\nLukimpore (Assam) at that time.\r\n\r\nIndigenous Tea was first discovered in Assam by a Mr. Bruce in 1830.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 and following years the Government imported large quantities of\r\nChina seed and established nurseries on the Himalayas.\r\n\r\nTea planting was commenced in India by the Assam Company about 1840,\r\nand the cultivation was undertaken in other districts in the following\r\nyears:--Kumaon and Gurwhal, 1850; Cachar, 1855; Dehra-Dhoon, 1855;\r\nSylhet, 1857; Kangra, 1858; Darjeeling, 1860; Terai, 1860; Chittagong,\r\n1860; Neilgherries, 1862; Chota Nagpore, 1872; Dooars, 1875.\r\n\r\nThus it may be said Tea planting in India dates from 1840 by one\r\nCompany, but 1850 by individuals.\r\n\r\nThe following figures show the imports of Indian Teas into Great\r\nBritain since 1870 in millions of pounds:--\r\n\r\n  +----+----------+\r\n  |    | Millions |\r\n  |Year|of Pounds |\r\n  +----+----------+\r\n  | 70 |    13    |\r\n  | 71 |  15-1/4  |\r\n  | 72 |    17    |\r\n  | 73 |  18-1/4  |\r\n  | 74 |  17-1/4  |\r\n  | 75 |  25-1/2  |\r\n  | 76 |  29-1/4  |\r\n  | 77 |  31-3/4  |\r\n  | 78 |    36    |\r\n  | 79 |  38-1/2  |\r\n  | 80 |    44    |\r\n  | 81 |  45-3/4  |\r\n  | 82 |  54-3/4  |\r\n  +----+----------+\r\n\r\nI may here remark that while the imports of Indian Teas have, since\r\n1877, increased by 23 million pounds, the imports of China Teas have\r\nincreased by 4 million pounds only in the same time.\r\n\r\nThe deliveries and stocks were as follows for 1881 and 1882 in millions\r\nof pounds:--\r\n\r\n                                 1881.    1882.\r\n  Deliveries                    48-3/4   50-1/2\r\n  Stocks on 31st December       18-1/2   21-3/4\r\n\r\nDuring the _last 3 months of_ 1882 the deliveries averaged 5 million\r\npounds per month. In January, 1883, they were 5-1/2 millions, and in\r\nFebruary (I write in March) 5 millions.\r\n\r\nDeliveries at this rate mean 60 millions a year.\r\n\r\n    I estimate Indian produce for 1883 at about 62     millions.\r\n    Deduct the probable quantity to be sent  }\r\n  to countries outside the United Kingdom,   }   5-1/2   „\r\n  and local consumption in India             }\r\n                                              ------------------\r\n    Leaving available for the home market    }  56-1/2 millions.\r\n                                              ==================\r\n\r\nThus, if deliveries continue at the present rate, demand must soon\r\nequal, if not exceed, supply, and the consequence naturally must be\r\nenhanced prices, which, however, will surely to some extent check the\r\ndeliveries.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a hopeful feature regarding Indian Teas. The taste\r\nfor them is increasing greatly. A very small per centage of the public\r\ndrink them pure (a large per centage in Ireland), but the public\r\ngenerally are now accustomed to the strength attained only by mixing,\r\nsay one third of Indian to two thirds China, and _will_ nothing weaker.\r\nThus retail dealers must continue to use them, and thus though, as\r\nremarked, increased prices _will_ check deliveries, they will not do so\r\nwith Indian Teas to the same extent they would with China.\r\n\r\nAnother hopeful feature is (for details see further on) a growing\r\ndemand for Indian Tea is now established in Australia, and has quite\r\nlately commenced in America. Thus, I think, the increased produce from\r\nIndia (which in no case can be large for some years[90]) will probably\r\nbe met by this outside demand, leaving no greater quantity than now\r\navailable for the home market. True Ceylon (a new field) will increase\r\nthe supply, but it will not be by much for some time. Take it all in\r\nall, I look hopefully at the prospects of Indian Tea in the future. I\r\nnever anticipate a range of prices as good even as ruled in 1881, but\r\na good deal better than we had in 1882, and thus enough to make the\r\nindustry a paying one.\r\n\r\nI have lately received a valuable paper on Indian Tea statistics from\r\nMessrs. Gow and Wilson, Indian Tea brokers. I cannot transcribe the\r\ndiagram they allude to, but otherwise I give the complete paper as sent\r\nme:--\r\n\r\n  19, Little Tower Street, Mincing Lane,\r\n      London, _15th February, 1883_.\r\n\r\n      “INDIAN TEA STATISTICS.”\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir,--Now that the annual figures are made up, we beg to submit\r\n  a statement showing the continued progress made by Indian Tea in\r\n  public estimation, together with comparative figures relating to the\r\n  consumption of China and Indian Teas,--And remain, dear Sir, yours\r\n  faithfully,\r\n\r\n  GOW AND WILSON, _Indian Tea Brokers_.\r\n\r\n  The very considerable increase in the home consumption of Indian\r\n  Tea during the last quarter of 1882, and January this year, once\r\n  more attracts attention to the growing importance of India as a\r\n  field of production, and the increasing appreciation of the British\r\n  public for Indian Teas, whether used alone or mixed with China sorts.\r\n  Notwithstanding the check to consumption in the early part of 1882,\r\n  when Indian medium and common Teas were just 50 per cent. dearer\r\n  than they now are, the average monthly deliveries of the first three\r\n  months were 3,670,000 lbs., or 230,000 lbs. a month more than the\r\n  average of the first quarter of 1880, with prices much the same at\r\n  both periods. Quotations last year receded step by step, and, as\r\n  prices dropped, so we found the consumption grew, till for the last\r\n  quarter of 1882, with its very low range of prices, the average\r\n  monthly deliveries reached the unprecedented figures of over 5-1/4\r\n  million pounds.\r\n\r\n  The average monthly deliveries in each quarter of the last five years\r\n  have been as follows:--\r\n\r\n  (In thousands of lbs., 000’s omitted.)\r\n\r\n           Jan-Mar.   April-June.  July-Sept.   Oct-Dec.\r\n  1878      3,216       3,129        2,869       3,041\r\n  1879      3,444       2,688        2,461       3,155\r\n  1880      3,441       3,418        3,522       4,228\r\n  1881      4,197       4,172        3,824       4,094\r\n  1882      3,670       4,125        4,116       5,254\r\n\r\n  During the year 1878, out of every 100 lbs. of all descriptions of\r\n  Tea consumed in this country, 23, or one in about four-and-a-third,\r\n  was Indian Tea. Last year the proportion was 31 per cent., or nearly\r\n  one in three.\r\n\r\n  These figures show, in the clearest manner, how steadily Indian Tea\r\n  is becoming popular.\r\n\r\n  The unevenness of the quarterly deliveries of China Tea in the year\r\n  1878 and 1879 is due to the apprehensions felt in those years that\r\n  the duty would be increased. In consequence, clearances were hastily\r\n  made before the Budget announcement, and the deliveries immediately\r\n  after sank to very low figures, increasing again as stocks of\r\n  retailers were depleted. In March, 1880, again there was a pressure\r\n  to clear Teas, which brought up the total deliveries of the first\r\n  quarter to a high level. A considerable check was given to deliveries\r\n  of Indian Teas during the latter part of 1881 and the early part of\r\n  1882 through the rise of prices during that period.\r\n\r\n  The most noticeable feature of the last three calendar years is the\r\n  stationariness of deliveries of China Teas at the reduction from the\r\n  level of both 1878 and 1879. Approximately the deliveries of China\r\n  and Indian Teas in the five years ending 31st December in each case\r\n  may be given, in millions of pounds, as follows:--\r\n\r\n             1878.   1879.   1880.   1881.   1882.\r\n  China       121     125     115     111     113\r\n  Indian       37      35      44      49      51\r\n\r\n  The deliveries of China Tea have _receded_ from 125 million pounds\r\n  in 1879 to 113 million pounds in 1882, while the home consumption\r\n  of Indian Tea has _increased_ from 35 million pounds to 51 million\r\n  pounds in the corresponding years.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding the supply of Indian Tea for the season 1882-3 is\r\n  estimated at the unprecedented figure of 55 million pounds against\r\n  the actual imports in the previous two season years of about 50\r\n  million and 46 million pounds respectively, it appears not unlikely\r\n  the consumption of 1882-3 will once again, as in 1880-81, overtake\r\n  the supply and reduce the stocks by July next to the equivalent of\r\n  less than three months’ deliveries.\r\n\r\n  We find that there has been received to the 31st December last,\r\n  33,218,000 lbs., leaving to arrive 21,782,000 lbs. for the six\r\n  months ending 30th June next, to make up the estimated supply of\r\n  55 million pounds which, according to Indian advices, will be\r\n  available for shipment to this country. The imports of the current\r\n  six months, therefore, will be but slightly in excess of those of\r\n  the corresponding half-year, when 20,948,000 lbs. were received; for\r\n  although the shipments of 1882-3 are expected to show an excess of\r\n  more than five million pounds over 1881-2, exporters this season have\r\n  hurried forward their Teas early and in the six months ended December\r\n  31st the arrivals in the United Kingdom were 32,218,000 lbs. against\r\n  only 28,947,000 lbs. in the corresponding half of 1881.\r\n\r\n  The significant feature of the movement, however, is the very\r\n  agreeable surprise, month by month, caused by the publication of the\r\n  delivery figures. These compare for the last few months as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Deliveries of the last Four Months compared with corresponding\r\n  Months._\r\n\r\n             October.    November.

Part of the decrease may be\r\n  attributed to the then higher range of medium and common Indian Teas.\r\n\r\n  The net result of the above statistics is that--with no materially\r\n  larger arrivals visible, even with the liberal allowance of 5,000,000\r\n  lbs. increased shipments for the crop year--the deliveries give every\r\n  promise of showing very considerable expansion, and, as we have said,\r\n  threaten for the complete year to more than absorb the extra supply.\r\n\r\n  To enable anyone to check and form an independent opinion on the\r\n  forecast we venture to give, we present below the imports and\r\n  deliveries, half-year by half-year, for the four seasons 1879-80 to\r\n  1882-83 inclusive, with the totals of each crop year:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  IMPORTS OF INDIAN TEA.\r\n\r\n                 1879-80.      1880-81.      1881-82.      1882-83.\r\n                   lbs.          lbs.          lbs.          lbs.\r\n  1st July to}\r\n    31st Dec.}  23,537,000    29,142,000    28,947,000     33,218,000\r\n\r\n  1st Jan. to}\r\n    30th June}  15,868,000    16,819,000    20,948,000 [91]21,782,000\r\n                ----------    ----------    ----------     ----------\r\n  Season year   39,405,000    45,961,000    49,895,000 [91]55,000,000\r\n\r\n\r\n  DELIVERIES OF INDIAN TEA.\r\n\r\n                 1879-80.       1880-1.       1881-2.       1882-3.\r\n                   lbs.           lbs.          lbs.          lbs.\r\n  1st July to}\r\n   31st Dec. }  16,847,000    24,352,000    23,755,000     27,109,000\r\n\r\n  1st Jan. to}\r\n   30th June }  19,465,000    25,106,000    23,386,000 [92]28,802,000\r\n                ----------    ----------    ----------     ----------\r\n  Season year   36,312,000    49,458,000    47,141,000 [92]55,911,000\r\n\r\n  These figures show an estimated supply to the end of June next of\r\n  21,782,000 lbs., and an estimated consumption of 28,802,000. The\r\n  former is based on the statements that the available supply for\r\n  the United Kingdom will be 55 million pounds, and the latter on\r\n  the actual delivery to January inclusive, and estimated average\r\n  deliveries of 4,500,000 lbs. a month for the remainder of the\r\n  half-year. Having these figures before us, we can proceed to\r\n  calculate the effect on stocks.\r\n\r\n  At 31st December last we had in warehouse            lbs.\r\n    a stock of                                      21,716,000\r\n  Add six months’ imports to June 30th              21,782,000\r\n                                                    ----------\r\n          Total supply                              43,498,000\r\n  Deduct estimated deliveries six months            28,802,000\r\n                                                    ----------\r\n  Leaving probable stock at 30th June               14,696,000\r\n  Which will compare with (at 30th June, 1882)      15,991,000\r\n\r\n  In stating the deliveries at an average of 4,500,000 lbs. for the\r\n  next five months, we have taken this amount merely for the purpose\r\n  of arriving at a conclusion. In case the deliveries of the months\r\n  of February to June inclusive average, as is generally expected,\r\n  5,000,000 lbs. a month, the stocks at 1st July next will be under\r\n  12,200,000 lbs., or 3-3/4 million lbs. less than at the corresponding\r\n  date.\r\n\r\n  We can but consider this a very healthy outlook, especially as it is\r\n  simultaneous with the estimated decrease in the supply of China Tea,\r\n  and the possibility that the shipments to the United Kingdom may not\r\n  reach the estimate. With respect to the latter contingency, we must\r\n  recollect that new markets are being rapidly developed for Indian\r\n  Tea. Australia, America, and other parts than the United Kingdom took\r\n  over three million pounds from 1st May to 31st December last year,\r\n  compared with less than a third of that quantity shipped thence from\r\n  India in the corresponding period of 1881. A continuance of this\r\n  rapid rate of outside demand would considerably curtail our supply,\r\n  and develope the growing Indian industry.\r\n\r\n      GOW AND WILSON,\r\n  _19, Little Tower Street, London, E.C._\r\n\r\nThe diagram omitted shows as follows: it gives the results quarterly,\r\nI only give them yearly in millions of pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSUMPTION OF CHINA AND INDIAN TEAS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM FOR THE LAST\r\nFIVE YEARS.\r\n\r\n  -------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-----------------\r\n         |  1878. |  1879. |  1880. |  1881. |  1882. |\r\n  -------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-----------------\r\n  China  | 128-1/2| 125-1/4| 114-1/2| 111-1/4| 114    |}All are Millions\r\n  Indian |  36    |  35-1/2|  43-3/4|  48-1/2|  51-1/2|}  of Pounds.\r\n  -------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-----------------\r\n  TOTALS.| 164-1/2| 160-3/4| 158-1/4| 159-3/4| 165-1/2|\r\n  -------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-----------------\r\n\r\nThus, while China Tea consumption has decreased in five years by\r\nfourteen and a-half millions of pounds, Indian has increased by fifteen\r\nand a-half millions!\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the former table given at page 194 deals\r\nwith imports, this with consumption, and thus the difference in the\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the _Tea Gazette_ (January, 1883) is\r\ninteresting in a statistical point of view:--\r\n\r\n  The exports to Australia (which, as it is well known, have increased\r\n  more than twenty-fold in six years) now occupy a position only second\r\n  to that of the United Kingdom; and if the P. and O. Company would see\r\n  its own interest, it would facilitate by every means in its power so\r\n  important a development of a great industry.\r\n\r\n  The Straits Settlements, in spite of their proximity to China,\r\n  took last year ten times the quantity they took six years ago;\r\n  and Persia, strange to say, has taken 54,712lbs. against 334lbs.\r\n  in 1876-77--Turkey in Asia and Egypt, together, having taken also\r\n  21,488lbs. against 886lbs. in the same period.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Liotard is of opinion that these are not a tithe of the openings\r\n  that might be found; and it is to be hoped that at the Amsterdam\r\n  Exhibition and elsewhere the Tea Syndicate will in no way relax its\r\n  efforts.\r\n\r\n  The imports of China Tea to India have, in the six years also above\r\n  referred to, increased about 60 per cent. Speaking on this point, we\r\n  are of opinion that the Syndicate might well make efforts to increase\r\n  the local consumption of Indian Tea to the replacement of Chinas, and\r\n  we feel sure that such organised exertion would be followed by very\r\n  satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n  The re-export of China Tea from India shows four times the quantity\r\n  of six years ago--by far the greater quantity going to Persia and\r\n  Turkey in Asia. Mr. Liotard thinks that the N.-W. P. and the Punjab\r\n  might appropriate a good deal of this trade; and from the character\r\n  of the Teas of these districts we are disposed to agree with him.\r\n  The great increase of export from Karachi shows that this, to some\r\n  extent, is being done.\r\n\r\n  The abolition of the duty on China Tea imported to India, under\r\n  the recent free trade policy, appears to have had a prejudicial\r\n  effect on the planters in Northern India--who can ill afford it.\r\n  The figures given at the commencement of the pamphlet show that\r\n  the number of plantations in Northern India has increased in six\r\n  years from 851 to 1,422, and the area from 4,246 to 7,466 acres;\r\n  the outturn from 1,311,113 lbs. to 2,271,773 lbs. These figures\r\n  speak of great activity in production, and show the necessity for\r\n  every exertion being employed to open out new markets. A combined\r\n  Syndicate for all the districts in Northern India, on the lines of\r\n  the one now established in Calcutta, is suggested, but how far this\r\n  is practicable we are not at present prepared to say.\r\n\r\nThe following, too, from the _Tea Gazette_ this year is in some\r\nrespects hopeful:--\r\n\r\n  We see from the _North China Herald_ that the exports of Tea from\r\n  Shanghai and the Yang-tse ports to England during the current year\r\n  have fallen off some six and a-half million pounds (8-1/2 per cent.),\r\n  and that there is also a decrease of some six million pounds in the\r\n  quantity sent to America this last year--making a difference of\r\n  nearly thirty per cent.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, there has been an increase of nearly three million\r\n  pounds (45 per cent.) in the direct export to Russian ports. Two\r\n  large cargoes--one of nearly three million pounds destined for\r\n  England, and one of almost two million pounds bound for Russia--were\r\n  lost, so that the real increase of China Tea sent to Russia is only\r\n  one million pounds, which would reduce the increase to about 15 per\r\n  cent. The decrease of Tea sent to England becomes even greater,\r\n  reducing the receipts as compared with last year by nearly ten\r\n  million pounds. Another aspect of the question must, however, be\r\n  considered, namely, that the real displacement, _i.e._, in the amount\r\n  of Tea destined for the English market, would be only six and a-half\r\n  million pounds, and it is not safe to reckon on a recurrence of loss\r\n  of such a heavy quantity by shipwreck.\r\n\r\n  The decrease of China Tea sent to America is almost entirely in green\r\n  Teas, there being only a falling off of 40,000lbs. in black, as\r\n  compared with one of over six millions in green Tea. The falling off\r\n  as regards the English market is much more evenly distributed between\r\n  the two varieties, the difference being greater in that of black than\r\n  of green Tea.\r\n\r\n  While America takes from the Shanghai ports over four times as much\r\n  green as black Tea, England, on the other hand, takes eleven times as\r\n  much black Tea as it does of green Tea.\r\n\r\n  These last facts might make it worth the while of planters in the\r\n  North-West Provinces and in the Punjab to combine to exploit the\r\n  American markets with half-chests of green Tea, for the manufacture\r\n  of which those districts are famous, and for which there is so little\r\n  demand at present in the Central Asian market. We merely throw out\r\n  the suggestion, knowing that most of the planters in these parts\r\n  could ill afford to risk much in such an experiment. It is possible\r\n  that the Syndicate here, which already ships largely to America,\r\n  might arrange to ship green Tea for such of the planters in Northern\r\n  India as cared to join the Calcutta body.\r\n\r\n  The American demand for green Tea is so large, that a quantity\r\n  representing the entire outturn of Northern India would form but\r\n  a small percentage of the whole, and if Indian green Tea from the\r\n  Himalayas were taken up in that market, a demand for the whole\r\n  quantity produced might easily arise. Whether it would ever be able\r\n  to compete with China green Tea in the matter of price we do not\r\n  know, and we should think it would be up-hill work, and attended with\r\n  some loss--in the first instance at any rate.\r\n\r\nThe more Tea each individual drinks, the better doubtless for the\r\nproducers. It is satisfactory therefore to find the consumption _per\r\nhead_ is increasing in the United Kingdom as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1870.     1875.     1880.\r\n   lbs.      lbs.      lbs.\r\n  3.81      4.44      4.59\r\n\r\nNearly 1 lb. per head more in 1880 than 1870!\r\n\r\nA few figures as to Indian Teas in Australia and America will finish\r\nthis Chapter of Statistics.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of Indian Tea in Australia and the Colonies stands as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  1880-81       Little under 3/4 of a million lbs.\r\n  1881-82       Nearly        1       million „\r\n  1882-83       Estimated     2       million „\r\n\r\nThis is a satisfactory increase, but when we consider how vast is the\r\ngreat Australasian field, it stands to reason two millions is but a\r\nsmall fraction of what it eventually may be.\r\n\r\nThe outdoor rough life, led more or less in the Colonies, makes its\r\ninhabitants the largest Tea drinkers in the world. For instance, each\r\nwhite denizen in New Zealand drinks nearly three times as much Tea as\r\neach person in Great Britain!\r\n\r\nThe following was the consumption in lbs. per head in 1878:--\r\n\r\n   United                                               New\r\n  Kingdom.   Victoria.   N. S. Wales.   Queensland.   Zealand.\r\n    4.66       6.92         7.53           9.16        11.05\r\n\r\nI now give, in millions of lbs., the consumption in 1880 in the same\r\nColonies:--\r\n\r\n  Victoria.    N. S. Wales.    Queensland.    New Zealand.\r\n    5-1/2           5              2               3\r\n\r\nBut what vast tracts exist outside these. The total consumption of all\r\nthe Colonies must be very large. We make the best Tea in the world in\r\nIndia, why should we not have a large share of the market?\r\n\r\nThe population of Australia is nearly 2-1/4 millions, and of Tasmania\r\nand New Zealand nearly 3/4 million, say three millions in all, or say\r\nthree-quarters of the population of London. What a field exists there\r\nfor Indian Tea!\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA.\r\n\r\nThe yearly consumption (Canada is included) is over eighty million\r\npounds, nearly all supplied by China and Japan. It is quite lately\r\nIndian Teas have been sent to America; so far, their reception has been\r\nfavourable. But the Americans are accustomed to a greener Tea than we\r\nmake in India, and this will prove a difficulty. Still we can make the\r\nTea they like, _if_ they will buy it. It is early to speculate much as\r\nto America, but I think we shall succeed little by little, especially\r\nas in the States they are awaking to the fact that both China and Japan\r\nTeas are adulterated.\r\n\r\nIn closing this chapter I must put on record the fact, known to all in\r\nIndia, that the great success achieved in Australia, and the opening\r\nthus early attained in America, is entirely due to the labours of the\r\nCalcutta Tea Syndicate, and that I firmly believe, much as they have\r\ndone, they would have done still more had they been properly supported\r\nby larger supplies of Tea by the planters in India, who, as a class,\r\nare strangely blind to the advantages of co-operation. I can only hope\r\nin this respect they will do better in future.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[90] It will not be large because much in the way of extensions has not\r\nbeen executed lately. A higher range of prices will doubtless cause\r\nmore land to be cultivated, but no produce from such will be available\r\nfor four or five years.\r\n\r\n[91] Estimated on basis of 55,000,000 lbs. available for shipment to\r\nthe United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n[92] Estimated on average monthly deliveries, February to June\r\ninclusive, of 4,500,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nMARKETS OUTSIDE GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have forestalled a good deal on the above in the last chapter, so\r\nthis will be short, but, I hope, cheering.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\nThis, from the correspondent of the _Tea Gazette_ in Melbourne, as to\r\nthe size of chests, should be attended to:--\r\n\r\n  If the planter wishes to get his Tea direct into consumption, the\r\n  packages must be small, to suit buyers. In the Colonies a large trade\r\n  is done in 38lb. half-chests. They are within the purchasing power of\r\n  a numerous class, and are easy to handle.\r\n\r\nA fierce fight has been going on in Melbourne between the advocates of\r\nChina and Indian Tea. The latter say China Tea is often adulterated,\r\nbut this is disputed by the former. Of course _I_ cannot say which is\r\nright, but chemical analysis, to which China Teas have been subjected\r\nin Melbourne, would seem to prove that in some cases they are _not_\r\npure. We all know China Teas in London have, in several instances, been\r\npronounced unfit for consumption, so it is _possible_, of course, that\r\nsimilar Teas are sent to Australia.\r\n\r\nThe Tea trade in China has taken alarm at our attempts on the\r\nAustralian market. This is what the _North China Herald_ (an organ of\r\nthe China Tea trade) said lately:--\r\n\r\n  There are no squeezing mandarins in India; there is European\r\n  supervision in the packing and firing of the leaf, and the\r\n  plantations are connected with civilisation by the railway and the\r\n  telegraph. Everything is done to give India an unfair advantage over\r\n  China. Consequently, India tea of the same quality is far cheaper in\r\n  London than the ill-regulated produce of Hankow and Foochow, and it\r\n  is only the conservatism of the consumer, _who is not yet entirely\r\n  habituated to the Indian flavour_, that prevents our losses being\r\n  much heavier than they are. Every year this preference for the leaf\r\n  that has been longer known is wearing away, and our buyers will soon\r\n  have to reckon with its disappearance. As yet, Indian Tea is hardly\r\n  taken on the continent of Europe at all; but here, too, it will\r\n  penetrate sooner or later, as it is doing into America and Australia,\r\n  and then there will be no corner of the earth where the sway of China\r\n  Tea will be undisputed. Until foreigners can supervise the packing\r\n  of the leaf in China as they do in India, the produce of the latter\r\n  country will continue to have an unfair advantage. The time no doubt\r\n  will come when we shall be able to go up and buy the raw leaf on\r\n  its native hills, pack it by our own methods, and bring it down by\r\n  railway to Shanghai for shipment; but _for years yet we labour under\r\n  the disadvantage of having to buy it just as the Chinamen choose to\r\n  prepare it, without any real knowledge of the total crop at any time,\r\n  or any immediate power to manipulate the Teas to suit the tastes of\r\n  consumers_.\r\n\r\nMark you, this is an enemy’s opinion. May his prognostications be\r\naccomplished to the letter!\r\n\r\nThe following is from the _Tea Gazette_ lately received:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE CALCUTTA TEA SYNDICATE.\r\n\r\n  We are glad to learn that this most useful body intends to continue\r\n  its operations in opening up, wherever possible, new markets,\r\n  although there will be no more soliciting supplies of Tea for\r\n  Australia--the feeling being that the trade in this direction may now\r\n  be left to take care of itself.\r\n\r\n  The Tea Syndicate has done a great good, and those able to ship to\r\n  Australia should at once arrange to take the fullest advantage of the\r\n  opening made for them. We would have wished that the Syndicate had\r\n  continued actively its operations there, but perhaps they are right\r\n  in leaving, now, the further development of the trade they have so\r\n  successfully founded to private enterprise. It will be the fault of\r\n  owners themselves if they do not take advantage of the large market\r\n  opened to them.\r\n\r\nI conclude my notice of Australia as a market by the following, also\r\nfrom the _Tea Gazette_. Matters there certainly look promising for the\r\nIndian planter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE NEW AUSTRALIAN TEA ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\n  Our friends in Australia, now that they are convinced of the purity\r\n  and good quality of our Indian Teas, have determined, we are glad to\r\n  see, to follow in the wake of the Calcutta Tea Syndicate, and push\r\n  by _united_ effort Indian Teas throughout the Australian Colonies.\r\n  Knowing full well that no half-hearted measures would be likely to\r\n  succeed, and that the efforts of a few individuals would not meet\r\n  the requirements of the market, our friends in Victoria and New\r\n  South Wales have _combined_, and formed an association under the\r\n  title of the “Calcutta Tea Association,” for the sale of pure and\r\n  unadulterated Indian Teas to wholesale merchants, storekeepers, and\r\n  customers in general. Large and handsome premises have been taken in\r\n  King Street, Melbourne, and Charlotte Place, Sydney, in which the\r\n  operations of the Association are to be carried on on a large scale.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA.\r\n\r\nThe following is from the _Daily News_--a Calcutta paper:--\r\n\r\n  We were glad to note that our American cousins were being induced to\r\n  give some orders. If only Indian Tea was once taken up, and became\r\n  popular, its future would be secured. The teeming masses of people\r\n  in the States would consume more Tea we should imagine than all\r\n  the English public, provided Indian Tea took the place of China.\r\n  Australia so far has done well, but the market there would be easily\r\n  glutted, whereas, if its use became general, it would be almost\r\n  impossible to glut the American market. The millions of settlers\r\n  in America and in Canada all use Tea at their meals very much as\r\n  an Englishman takes his beer, so that the inland consumption must\r\n  be very large. In Australia, every shepherd carries his pannikin\r\n  of Tea, and the amount he swallows in twelve months must be pretty\r\n  considerable. In the backwoods of America and Canada, each woodcutter\r\n  consumes nearly half a pound of Tea weekly, so that, with its\r\n  millions of people, America could easily dispose of millions of\r\n  pounds of Tea, which would not only clear off all the surplus Tea in\r\n  the London market, but would probably cause a deficit. We wonder if\r\n  in our time this golden era will take place.\r\n\r\nThis from the TEA GAZETTE:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  TEA IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n  A petition has been presented to the United States Congress asking\r\n  for the prohibition of the importation of adulterated Teas from\r\n  China and Japan, which are at present extensively sold. This, it is\r\n  thought, will lead to increased attention being paid to Indian Teas,\r\n  which are well known to be pure and unadulterated.\r\n\r\nAgain from same paper:--\r\n\r\n  The circular lately addressed to the local Tea planting interest by\r\n  the Committee of the Calcutta Syndicate, reporting the results of Mr.\r\n  Sibthorp’s efforts to create a market for Indian Teas in America,\r\n  opens up a vista of unprecedented prosperity in the future.\r\n\r\n  That the population of America, the bulk of which consist of the same\r\n  races among whom Indian Tea has grown in favour so rapidly in the\r\n  United Kingdom, should persist in rejecting it after a fair trial was\r\n  _à priori_ highly improbable. It was, therefore, reasonably to be\r\n  presumed that whatever difficulty might beset the opening up of this\r\n  new market would consist chiefly in the obstacles to securing such a\r\n  trial.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Sibthorp’s report not only bears out this view of the case, but\r\n  justifies a confident expectation that the obstacles in question,\r\n  so far as they have any real existence, will speedily disappear. In\r\n  Chicago, so far from having had to encounter any of those strong\r\n  trade prejudices which were met with at first in Australia, Mr.\r\n  Sibthorp found the leading importers, Messrs. J. Doane and Co., ready\r\n  to render every assistance and confident of being able to dispose\r\n  of five thousand half chests the first season, without forcing the\r\n  market. Similar success seems to have attended his efforts in New\r\n  York, and a telegram has been received from him ordering a thousand\r\n  half chests for shipment to that port.\r\n\r\n  The importance of this new market is immensely enhanced by the\r\n  circumstance that the American consumption of Tea is destined to\r\n  increase, owing to mere growth of population, at a rate not to be\r\n  looked for in any other country; at such a rate, in fact, that if\r\n  India could only secure the annual addition to the demand from this\r\n  cause, she would probably have to double her production in less than\r\n  a generation to enable her to meet it.\r\n\r\n  So far from seeing any reason why she should not secure this amount\r\n  of custom in the New World, we see none why the proportion of India\r\n  to other Teas consumed in America should not ultimately be as large\r\n  as in England, where there was once a strong prejudice against Indian\r\n  Tea.\r\n\r\nWhat possible foreign markets have we besides Australia and America?\r\nRussia and many European countries are on the cards, and if the\r\nCalcutta Syndicate will continue its work great results may ensue.\r\nThose who know the Continent often say, and it is true, that no good\r\nTea can be had in France, Germany, or Italy (it is _not_ so in Russia),\r\nand retail dealers have offered again and again (made the offers to\r\nme) to take large quantities of the Indian Tea of which I have shown\r\nthem samples. As this is so, why not supply them? But it cannot be done\r\nwell to any extent by individual planters. The Calcutta Syndicate could\r\neasily do it, and I quite believe they would find the work in Europe\r\neasier than in America.\r\n\r\nThe Amsterdam Exhibition, so soon to take place, affords a great\r\nopening, and from all I hear it will be taken advantage of. Inhabitants\r\nfrom all countries will be there, and the fame of our Teas should thus\r\nspread throughout Europe. The _Tea Gazette_ says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE AMSTERDAM EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n  It is intended to have Indian Tea well represented at the forthcoming\r\n  Exhibition at Amsterdam; and we trust that the most will be made of\r\n  the opportunity. There is no reason why we should not succeed in\r\n  Holland as well as we have succeeded in _America_ and _Australia_.\r\n  The rapid strides going on in production must be met by exceptionally\r\n  active exertions to open out new markets, and to see that those\r\n  recently opened out are not allowed to drop for want of fostering.\r\n\r\n  The effect of this opportunity will be by no means limited to\r\n  Holland, as in all probability thousands will flock to the Exhibition\r\n  from adjacent countries, and many from all parts of the world.\r\n\r\n  We hope that every advantage will be taken of future International\r\n  Exhibitions in any part of the world by an adequate quasi-permanent\r\n  organization in Calcutta, and we sincerely trust that the existing\r\n  Calcutta Tea Syndicate will not cease its most useful operations\r\n  until all the world bows to the great god Indian Tea. The operations\r\n  in countries other than Great Britain during the last few years show\r\n  what important developments in the Tea trade of this country are\r\n  now taking place, and every exertion is necessary to maintain these\r\n  successful results--for which the industry is so much indebted to the\r\n  Syndicate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIBET.\r\n\r\nThis is a large, mountainous, and table land country on the northern\r\nside of the Himalayas. It is at a very high elevation, intensely cold,\r\nand very thinly populated. The Thibetans drink much Tea per head, but\r\nthey use Brick Tea; this is made of the coarsest leaves compressed with\r\nsome glutinous substance.\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty in its manufacture. At present it is supplied by\r\nChina, which is close by, but not nearer than India. Many think much\r\nof our coarse Tea (particularly from the Himalayan gardens) might find\r\na market in Thibet, and I incline to the belief they are right. The\r\nquantity would not be very large, “but every little helps.”\r\n\r\nFormerly much Tea was sold to the native tribes over the northern\r\nborder by the gardens in Kumaon, Gurwal, and Kangra. Why I know not,\r\nbut I hear the trade has fallen off to some extent; the Teas are taken\r\nto the Central Asian markets.\r\n\r\nI have done with foreign markets, but there is yet another and a very\r\nlarge one regarding which nothing has yet been done: I allude to the\r\nmarket among the natives of India, in other words\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOCAL MARKET.\r\n\r\nThe following is from the _Calcutta Englishman_ on the subject:--\r\n\r\n  The letter of our correspondent “A. E. T.” calls attention for the\r\n  hundredth time to the failure of the planting interest to make the\r\n  most of the local demand for Indian Teas. It is only necessary to\r\n  compare the prices realised at the public auctions with those at\r\n  which even the most liberal of our retail firms offer to supply\r\n  their customers with such Teas to see that but a very small fraction\r\n  of the difference between the prime cost of the Tea and what the\r\n  consumer has to pay for it goes into the pocket of the planter. It is\r\n  probably no exaggeration to say that while the consumer pays, on the\r\n  average, from twelve annas to a rupee per pound more than the actual\r\n  cost of the Tea laid down in Calcutta, the planter may think himself\r\n  fortunate if he can appropriate from half an anna to an anna of this\r\n  sum. By whatever course of argument the fact may be justified, it is\r\n  certainly not justifiable by the equity of the case as it appears\r\n  to ordinary minds. For it is the planter who has borne the heat and\r\n  burden of the day, and the proportion which the capital invested by\r\n  him bears to the ultimate return is immensely greater in his case\r\n  than in that of the retail dealer.\r\n\r\n  On whom does the blame for the continuance of this state of things,\r\n  if blame there be in the matter, rest? Hardly on the public. They\r\n  would only be too glad to allow the Tea planter, say, four times\r\n  his present profit instead of allowing twelve times that profit to\r\n  a middleman or a series of middlemen. The public, however, can give\r\n  their custom only to those who bid for it, and who consult their\r\n  convenience in the arrangements they make to secure it.\r\n\r\n  It is evidently the planter, and the planter alone, who can move in\r\n  the matter. But whether out of regard for the interests of the retail\r\n  dealer, or from a belief that the game is not worth the candle, he\r\n  does not move. If there were a retail Tea trade worthy of the name,\r\n  in the proper sense of the term, in Calcutta, it would probably not\r\n  be to the interest of planters to enter into competition with it.\r\n  But though we have many retail establishments who deal in Tea, its\r\n  sale is, in the great majority of cases, only one item of a very\r\n  multifarious business, the profit on which, as a whole, is probably\r\n  not excessive under all the circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n  As to the game not being worth the candle, that is possibly the case\r\n  if only the present demand is considered. But we are persuaded that\r\n  it is otherwise if regard is had to the expansion of which that\r\n  demand is capable.\r\n\r\n  If Indian Tea were procurable in the bazaars in parcels of moderate\r\n  size at a reasonable advance on auction prices, we believe that\r\n  a large native demand for it would rapidly grow up. As it is, an\r\n  extensive business goes on in China Tea of the most wretched quality,\r\n  some of it sold in packets of a few ounces, and some of it loose in\r\n  still smaller quantities. Even in Calcutta this Tea is sold at prices\r\n  which would pay the Indian Tea planter a handsome profit, while in\r\n  the interior it is sold at rates which would have been high fifty\r\n  years ago.\r\n\r\n  Surely a Syndicate which extends its efforts for the popularisation\r\n  of Indian Tea to such distant and widely separated markets as\r\n  Australia and America might profitably make some systematic effort to\r\n  promote its use among the vast population at its doors.\r\n\r\n  The time may be far distant when the great bulk of this population\r\n  will adopt Tea as an ordinary beverage; but the way in which the\r\n  habit of using it has spread during the last ten or fifteen years,\r\n  among all classes of the vast population of Calcutta, affords an\r\n  indication of possibilities very well worth testing.\r\n\r\nWhen last in India I wrote on this subject largely, but all to no\r\navail. The following was one of my letters which appeared in the _Tea\r\nGazette_:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE MARKET AT OUR DOORS.--CONSUMPTION OF CHINA TEA IN INDIA.\r\n\r\n  The _Statesman_, in a recent article, observes as follows, while\r\n  discussing the maritime trade of British India:--\r\n\r\n  “Perhaps the most anomalous import we have is Tea. It is hardly\r\n  conceivable that while Indian Tea continues to advance in public\r\n  estimation at home, we should not only use China Tea in India, but\r\n  that in increasing quantities.”[93]\r\n\r\n  In 1876-77 the imports of China Teas were a little _under_ two\r\n  millions, but in 1880-81 as much _over_ three millions! The\r\n  _Statesman_ states, and truly, that the reason of this is simply\r\n  “that Indian Tea is sold in too large packets to be easily obtainable\r\n  by the general public, for it seems, as regards Indian Tea, the\r\n  smallest quantity that can be bought is one pound, whereas an ounce\r\n  of China Tea can be purchased.”\r\n\r\n  Further on, the _Statesman_ kindly alludes to my advocacy in the _Tea\r\n  Gazette_ of a company to sell Tea in small packages to the natives,\r\n  stating also that such a trade is “capable of almost unlimited\r\n  expansion at a fair profit,” which is exactly what I have, for some\r\n  time, been trying to hammer into the heads of those interested in the\r\n  Tea industry of India.\r\n\r\n  Now, Sir, is it not absurd that while the _bête noir_ of our industry\r\n  is “supply in excess of demand,” and while, with this dread, we\r\n  are trying (it seems with success) to open up new markets at the\r\n  Antipodes and in America, we are neglecting a market at our very\r\n  doors, the limits of which, I hold, no man can foresee, for is it not\r\n  a market where the possible buyers number 200 millions?\r\n\r\n  Is it not also more than absurd, nay a very shame to those interested\r\n  in our industry, that while we have a better article than China Tea,\r\n  we allow, by our supineness and lack of enterprise, more than three\r\n  million pounds of an inferior article to be sold in the birth place\r\n  of the better? And why? simply because we _will_ not supply it in the\r\n  form the teeming crowd of natives willing, nay anxious, to buy can\r\n  avail themselves of it!\r\n\r\n  Since I advocated in your paper the formation of a company to sell\r\n  Tea to natives in small packets, and showed, I thought conclusively:\r\n  1--That the capital required was not large (say one and a-half\r\n  lakhs). 2--That the shareholders might expect very fair dividends.\r\n  3--That there was no assignable limit to the trade which might be\r\n  developed. 4--That if such a company was started and worked well, all\r\n  fear for the future of Indian Tea would be at an end. 5--That every\r\n  Tea owner, who became a shareholder, would advance his own interests\r\n  by many times more than the dividends he would receive--since then I\r\n  have obtained from England estimates of all the machinery required to\r\n  bulk and pack the Teas, advice from the best firms as to _the mode_\r\n  so successful in England, and I am more than ever convinced that the\r\n  company would be a money-making one, and that, in two words, we shall\r\n  sadly neglect our own interests if we do not accomplish it.\r\n\r\n  Again, since my former articles I have spoken to dozens of Tea\r\n  planters and Tea owners on the subject, and all of them think highly\r\n  of the scheme, while many only wait for the company to be launched\r\n  to take shares. I could name more than one influential native also\r\n  who is willing to join, and this is a good sign, for, in my opinion,\r\n  a moiety of the directors should be natives. I will myself become a\r\n  large shareholder, though I cannot offer my services on the board,\r\n  for it must be in Calcutta, and I do not reside there.\r\n\r\n  I am convinced, if the company is launched, the shares will be taken\r\n  up in a week.\r\n\r\n  But if no one in Calcutta is public-spirited enough to launch such\r\n  a company, why should not an association of a few individuals try\r\n  to carry out the scheme. I quite believe Tea proprietors would help\r\n  them, at starting, by supplying, on reasonable credit, the coarse\r\n  Teas suitable. Were this done, the thin edge of the wedge would\r\n  be driven in, and, if the association succeeded, they might later\r\n  transfer the business at a fair profit to a company.\r\n\r\n  I had written so far when I saw your remarks on the same subject in\r\n  your last issue. I cannot agree with you in thinking an association\r\n  would be _better_ than a company, but I say, failing the last let us\r\n  have the first--in fact, let us make a beginning.\r\n\r\n  I give here below, to save the trouble of reference, the last part of\r\n  my former article:--\r\n\r\n  “I will now, in conclusion, shortly estimate for how much two and\r\n  four ounce packets could be sold to the consumer.\r\n\r\n  “Supposing suitable Teas could be bought at six annas per lb. (and\r\n  all Tea planters know that a very large supply of broken Teas with\r\n  some red leaf would be available at that price), one ounce would\r\n  equal 4-1/2 pie or 9 pie for 2 ounces. We may then calculate thus for\r\n  each 2 ounce packet:\r\n\r\n                                                           R. A.

M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nMAKING INDIAN TEA KNOWN IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral plans have at times been proposed in India with a view to make\r\nthe merits of pure Indian Teas known in England. When I was last out\r\nthere I saw the following letter in the _Calcutta Statesman_, and it\r\nappeared to me the plan suggested was in every way an excellent one:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  HOW TO PUSH THE SALE OF TEA.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor “Statesman.”_\r\n\r\n  Sir,--Referring to your leader of to-day on the subject of selling\r\n  Tea at home, I agree with you that Tea-growers should combine for\r\n  retailing, as they have, through the Syndicate, combined for opening\r\n  up new markets, but there must be the same spirit of enterprise in\r\n  the one case as in the other. Now, the mere opening up of shops for\r\n  the sale of Indian Teas, involving, as it would, rents, expensive\r\n  establishments, and bad debts, would not afford the necessary scope,\r\n  nor would it meet the case.\r\n\r\n  The system of auction in Mincing Lane must with all its drawbacks\r\n  continue, but it is surely possible to extract some good from it. Let\r\n  agencies for such a combination as you propose be established in all\r\n  the large towns in Great Britain, and weekly auctions of packets of\r\n  Tea from 2 ounces to 5 lbs. or so be held in different parts of each\r\n  town, so that every day except Sunday there would be an auction going\r\n  on somewhere. Let the sales be _bonâ fide_ to the highest bidder\r\n  and for cash on the nail, and I will promise that before a year is\r\n  over, as high prices will be paid at these auctions as are at present\r\n  realised by Cooper and Cooper, whilst the demand would soon greatly\r\n  exceed the supply.\r\n\r\n  If something of the same kind were done in the bazaars of India, the\r\n  taste which so decidedly exists among natives would develop rapidly.\r\n\r\n          MATT. DREWS.\r\n  Calcutta, _January 4th, 1882_.\r\n\r\nI wrote the following remarks on the above to the same paper:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  INDIAN TEA SALES AT HOME.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor “Statesman.”_\r\n\r\n  Sir,--Your article of Wednesday on the above, and a letter from Mr.\r\n  Drews in Thursday’s paper, have interested me much. As you truly say,\r\n  it is more than absurd that the public at home should pay 150 per\r\n  cent. for our Teas above the prices at which they are sold in Mincing\r\n  Lane, and that this tremendous profit, minus 6_d._ duty, should all\r\n  go into the hands of the retail dealer. Absurd as it is, it is still\r\n  a great fact, and the absurdity can only be increased in one way, and\r\n  that is, if we remain quiet, accept the position, and do nothing.\r\n\r\n  That we ought to move, and move quickly, is very certain. How best to\r\n  act requires serious consideration, and ample discussion.\r\n\r\n  You advocate a company or association to sell our Teas retail in all\r\n  the large towns in Great Britain, and advocate a subscription of\r\n  Rs. 10 per month by each garden in India, until the business could\r\n  support itself. Nothing _can_ be done unless we all subscribe a\r\n  small sum to set it going, and the amount you mention (Rs. 120 for\r\n  one year; the necessity would most assuredly last no longer) should\r\n  frighten no one, while, if done generally by the Indian gardens, it\r\n  would be ample. I would suggest, therefore, that we should begin the\r\n  matter as set out below.\r\n\r\n  The following none of the very many interested in Tea can deny:--\r\n\r\n  1. The large profits made on Indian Teas at home are not realised by\r\n  the producers, but by the retail dealers.\r\n\r\n  2. We can easily undersell the said retail dealers, to the tune of 50\r\n  per cent. or more, and still work at a large profit.\r\n\r\n  3. If the retail dealers were so undersold, an enormous custom would\r\n  ensue to us, or rather the agents we employed.\r\n\r\n  4. If Indian Teas were procurable at a fair price all over Great\r\n  Britain, because Indian Tea is superior to China, because those who\r\n  have drunk Indian never revert to China, because thousands would then\r\n  taste our Teas for the first time, and continue their use--I say,\r\n  because of all this, little by little, the consumption would increase\r\n  in a ratio we do not dream of now.\r\n\r\n  5. The consumption so increased, we should necessarily, because\r\n  demand exceeded supply, get good prices at the public marts in\r\n  Calcutta and London, and in consequence thereof the value of all Tea\r\n  property in India would be greatly enhanced.\r\n\r\n  I believe all the above would _certainly_ follow on a general\r\n  well-combined movement on our part; but let us take the worst view.\r\n  No one can deny that they _might_ do so. Would Rs. 120 be a large\r\n  stake from each garden for even the chance? Let us _begin_ thus:\r\n  Open a list in your office for the names of those gardens willing to\r\n  join. One year’s subscription, at Rs. 10 per month, should be the\r\n  limit from each garden. When enough names are collected to warrant\r\n  further movement, call a meeting in Calcutta, and let the next steps\r\n  be decided on, and in the interval--agitate; I will help to the best\r\n  of my power, and collect opinions from all sides.\r\n\r\n  Open the list with the names of the three gardens I represent (as per\r\n  enclosure), equivalent at once to a subscription of Rs. 360.\r\n\r\n  Now, as to the question--_how_ to do it? I give you my views, but let\r\n  them be criticised and discussed. We want to do it, and to do it the\r\n  best way.\r\n\r\n  What I have been suggesting for months in the _Tea Gazette_, as\r\n  the best thing to do in India--_viz._, to sell Tea by auction in\r\n  convenient forms as to quantity for native consumption--is really\r\n  what I advise for England. I am quite at one with Mr. Drews on this\r\n  point. (I wish you would reprint his valuable letter above, and then\r\n  my allusions to it would be understood.) Retail shops and all they\r\n  would entail, _viz._, intricate supervision, rents, establishments,\r\n  and what not, necessitate details quite outside our legitimate\r\n  sphere as producers. No organisation we could devise would carry on\r\n  successfully two or three hundred shops at home. We (that is, the\r\n  company or the association) _could_ not efficiently superintend such\r\n  a complicated business, and we should be cheated right and left. But\r\n  let others, I say, do the work for us at their own risk, as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Sell Teas in whole, half, and quarter chests, in tins of 10, 5, and\r\n  1 lbs., in packets of 8, 4, and 2 ounces once a week (the market\r\n  day) in country towns; daily, in different localities in London,\r\n  Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, and such like cities--all by\r\n  auction to the highest bidder for _cash_, in lots which would suit\r\n  both retail dealers and retail purchasers. Never mind if there be a\r\n  loss at the commencement; the quantities sold, till we felt our way,\r\n  need not be large.\r\n\r\n  What would be the result? Retail dealers would shortly sell as much\r\n  Indian as China Tea, _if they could get it_. Our Teas would go into\r\n  thousands of houses where it has never been tasted yet. The demand\r\n  would increase on all sides; prices in Mincing Lane, and consequently\r\n  in Calcutta, would rise, and no fear of a glutted market could then\r\n  exist. In two words, Indian Teas would, I believe, six months after\r\n  such operations were commenced, become the rage in England, and we,\r\n  the owners of Tea property, would add 50 per cent. to the value of\r\n  our estates.\r\n\r\n  Is not even the _chance_ of all this worth an outlay of Rs. 120 for\r\n  each garden? I am proud to head the list with my Rs. 360, and I do\r\n  beg of all interested in Tea to follow my lead.\r\n\r\n  In the plan I have sketched, like Mr. Drews, all the operations would\r\n  be simple. The necessary supervision would be small: the details\r\n  easily arranged. The Teas would of course be bought in the open\r\n  market in London and distributed for public auction to the different\r\n  localities. There might be some loss at first (it is for this the\r\n  capital is wanted), but if always sold to the highest bidder, there\r\n  would be none--nay, a handsome profit after a time; and though I do\r\n  _not_ think with Mr. Drews, nor should I wish, that the prices would\r\n  eventually equal Cooper and Cooper’s, I do think that the said firm\r\n  would soon find it useless to advertise their _cheapest_ Indian Tea\r\n  at 3 shillings a pound--Tea for which they certainly paid no more\r\n  than 13 pence!\r\n\r\n  I may add that I quite agree with the last paragraph of Mr. Drews’\r\n  letter; but a sale for India and a sale for England are two different\r\n  things, and I will not treat of both together.\r\n\r\n  EDWARD MONEY.\r\n\r\n  Western Dooars, _January 7, 1882_.\r\n\r\nAlas! in this case, like the one of supply of Tea to natives, nothing\r\npractical came of it. A _very few_ gardens agreed to subscribe, and the\r\nmatter dropped.\r\n\r\nOf all the plans that have been mooted, this of Mr. Drews I believe to\r\nbe the best. I wish a small company in England would try to initiate\r\nit. No greater boon, in my opinion, could be conferred on the Indian\r\nTea industry; and were such a Company, with good names, launched in\r\nEngland, a large proportion of the shares would probably be taken in\r\nIndia. A very moderate capital would suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nTEA MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much has it been extended and improved since the Third Edition was\r\npublished, I have much to say on this subject.\r\n\r\nI will divide it into two headings, “Tea Cultivation” and “Tea\r\nManufacture.” Of course the machines for the last far outnumber the\r\nfirst, which are very few, but much of great importance to the industry\r\nwill find its place under the first heading--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Machinery and Implements for Tea Cultivation._\r\n\r\nFormerly, with prices as they ruled, Tea paid under most circumstances.\r\nIt is _not_ so now. Unless Tea, and good Tea, can be made cheap it is\r\nhopeless to look for profit from a Tea garden. To cultivate cheaply,\r\nand efficiently, is therefore all important (far more important than\r\nhas hitherto been recognized), and assuredly the more machinery can\r\nbe made to take the place of hand labour, the sooner shall we attain\r\nthat end. On this point I need only observe that in most of the Tea\r\ndistricts in India labour has to be imported at a great cost, varying\r\nfrom Rs. 50 to Rs. 100 per coolie, and anything which would lessen this\r\nwant would materially help to success.\r\n\r\nThe following, signed “Nil Desperandum,” appeared in the _Tea Gazette_\r\nin August, 1881. I quite agree with the writer and have myself often\r\nexpressed the same opinions:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLOUGHING AND HOEING MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir,--On looking over your columns I have been surprised to\r\n  see the small attention paid to agricultural machinery: in fact, I\r\n  can’t find the subject mentioned, although one would imagine it was\r\n  as important if not more so than manufacturing machinery. Various\r\n  agricultural instruments, such as ploughs, &c., have, I know, been\r\n  tried in old times, and not with the best results to the bushes; but\r\n  there is no reason why, because the ordinary machines have failed,\r\n  that planters should be sunk in the belief that that costly article\r\n  the coolie must endure as long as Tea does.[94]\r\n\r\nI will now consider the cultivation implements I know of.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Planting Pots._--These are made of clay, cow dung, and cut straw. They\r\nare placed in the nurseries and the Tea seed planted in them. When the\r\nseedlings are big enough to put out, pot and all is buried where the\r\nTea bush is to be. The pot being broken a little when placed in the\r\nground, the rain soon destroys it. The seedling _does not know_ it has\r\nbeen transplanted, and the check of six weeks or more, experienced by\r\nall transplants, is entirely avoided. I know not who invented the pots,\r\nbut the idea is an excellent one.\r\n\r\n_Jebens Transplanter._--This is an implement for lifting seedlings\r\nwithout injuring the rootlets or disturbing the soil around them. It\r\nis noticed at page 79 favourably: since that time (1878) it has been\r\nused more or less in all Tea districts. I have seen many opinions both\r\nfor and against it. I believe the truth is it works very well in light\r\nsoil, and with smallish seedlings, but does not answer in hard soil or\r\nwith plants above 2-1/2 feet high. Where the soil and size of seedlings\r\nare suitable, it certainly saves much of the check experienced\r\notherwise by transplants.\r\n\r\nI know of no other peculiar implements for Tea cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe greatest expense connected with cultivation is, naturally, opening\r\nthe soil or digging; the spade is never used in India and would not\r\nanswer. Coolies dig with a kodali, a thing something like a spade,\r\nwith the handle set at right angles to the blade. Could we dispense\r\nwith this, and cultivate between the lines of Tea with ploughs of any\r\nsuitable pattern, whether worked by steam or animal power, an enormous\r\nsaving would be effected. I am sure the _whole_ space between two lines\r\nof Tea can never be so done, round each and every bush the soil _must_\r\nbe opened by hand; but the centre space, say about 2-1/2 to 3 feet,\r\ncould, I am convinced, be so worked, and I think it is only a question\r\nof time when it will be so treated.\r\n\r\nThe planting community are gradually appreciating the fact that\r\nsomething _may_ be done in this way. The following appeared in the _Tea\r\nGazette_, end of 1881, _re_ ploughing by steam:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLOUGHING _v._ HOEING.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir,--I am glad to see by the letter of a “Man in the Kundah”\r\n  that some managers have taken up the idea of ploughing instead of\r\n  hoeing. It is an idea which I have been dinning into the ears of Tea\r\n  planters ever since I saw a Tea garden. Mr. Lyell deserves credit,\r\n  and so will everyone who assists to introduce ploughing instead of\r\n  hoeing. The saving of labour would be immense. The gentlemen who are\r\n  interested in the subject will be glad to learn that I wrote home\r\n  last month to several leading agricultural machinery people asking\r\n  the fullest particulars as to _steam ploughing machinery_, with a\r\n  view to seeing how far suitable it would be for Tea cultivation. As\r\n  soon as all my information arrives, and I have thought the matter\r\n  out, I will give the planting community my opinion. I have, as far as\r\n  I am personally concerned, already formed it, and am confident that\r\n  at no very distant date the steam plough will supersede the _dhangar_\r\n  or other hand labour. But of course I must make out a strong case for\r\n  it, or my opinions would be supposed to arise from a professional\r\n  predilection for machinery.\r\n\r\n  F.\r\n\r\n  Siligoorie, _27th November, 1882_.\r\n\r\nAgain, “Nil Desperandum,” quoted above, continues:--\r\n\r\n  I enclose a report on Darby’s Digger from the _Times_ and _Pioneer_,\r\n  which shows that it is an instrument possessing the principle we\r\n  require in deep hoeing, _viz._, turning the earth completely over,\r\n  and bringing the subsoil to the surface, although of course far too\r\n  unwieldy, costly, and weighty to be used in Tea. It is, however, the\r\n  first step in the right direction, as it closely copies spade action;\r\n  and we may hope that before long a machine with that principle, and\r\n  capable of being worked in a Tea khet, will be brought out. For light\r\n  hoeing, last cold weather I procured from Messrs. Vipan and Headly,\r\n  Church Gate, Leicester, England, two expanding horse hoes, which I\r\n  worked all the hot weather, and which did their work admirably and\r\n  at a much cheaper rate than can be done by hand labour. Two of these\r\n  hoes hoe a 12-acre khet in six days up the lines of Tea and across\r\n  them, but to make a thorough job it is better to go over the work\r\n  again. The total cost of this:--\r\n\r\n                     Planted 4′ × 4′\r\n              { Pay of boy and man 12 days         =  3  6  0\r\n  For one hoe { Food of bullocks @ 4 as. per}\r\n              { diem, Barley @ 24 per Rupee }      =  2  0  0\r\n                                                      -------\r\n  Cost of light hoeing 12-acre khet                =  5  6  0\r\n                                                            2\r\n                                                      -------\r\n                   Against                           10 12  0\r\n                                                     ========\r\n  Nirrikh for 136 bildars, light hoeing, 240 spaces,\r\n    4′ × 4′, per diem @ 0-2-9 each                 = 23  6  0\r\n                                                     ========\r\n  Or a saving of more than 100 per cent.\r\n\r\n  I gave one 12-acre khet four of these light hoeings during the hot\r\n  weather, which so thoroughly destroyed the grass seeds that, although\r\n  heavy rain has fallen here for the last month and a-half, the grass\r\n  in this khet is thin and not more than 6″ high, a fact which, to\r\n  those who know how the jungle springs up in cultivated ground in\r\n  the Doon when the rains set in, will be a sufficient proof of the\r\n  success of these instruments. The frame of the hoe is only 7″ high,\r\n  and when the blades are buried in the ground is only 4″, and as the\r\n  handle projects from the centre of the back of the hoe and not from\r\n  the sides, there is no danger of the bushes being injured. The hoe\r\n  will expand from 14″ to 20″ at back, and from 3″ to 7″ in front;\r\n  and as the standards of the blades are curved outwards, the hoe in\r\n  its greatest expansion cultivates a breadth of 27″ of ground. I\r\n  found that one bullock was too weak to drag a hoe, although a good\r\n  pony was quite equal to the work, so put in a pair of bullocks. The\r\n  bullocks and hoe take up between them three rows of Tea at once, the\r\n  bullocks on each outside row and the hoe in the centre one. A boy\r\n  walking up the centre row leads the bullocks, which are harnessed to\r\n  the hoe in the same manner as bullocks are harnessed to the country\r\n  ploughs, but with longer julas of course. These hoes are, I find,\r\n  useless during wet weather, as they clog dreadfully, but during hot\r\n  dry weather they are invaluable. What we now want is a machine that,\r\n  either by bullock, horse, or steam power, will do our deep hoeing as\r\n  well as the light hoe does the light hoeing. This is a matter which\r\n  I consider of vital interest to owners and shareholders, as, unless\r\n  in these days of very low prices we can reduce the cost of production\r\n  considerably, we cannot hope that Tea will pay a fair interest on the\r\n  money expended, and great length of time lost in getting up a garden.\r\n\r\n  NIL DESPERANDUM.\r\n\r\nIn the above, two bullocks to drag the plough or digger are evidently\r\ncontemplated. My experience is, that two draught cattle cannot be used,\r\nsimply because there is not room for them between the lines of Tea.[95]\r\nIf animal power is used, it must be a single bullock alone. How to\r\nharness a single bullock to the plough is the question. A collar with a\r\nhinge below, which allows it to open at top, may be put on from below,\r\nand then the sides fastened together at the top. But I advise another\r\nplan, which I have seen most successfully practised in Austria. The\r\ntraces, joining together, and thus becoming one behind the bullock,\r\nare fastened to the horns, and tightly connected with a leather pad\r\nacross the animal’s forehead. The bullock thus pulls by his head, and\r\nI am sure he can pull in no more efficient or easier way to himself.\r\nBullocks in pairs, or singly, are thus harnessed for plough work in\r\nAustria, and I have seen single animals dragging ploughs of much\r\ngreater weight and power than we should require in our Tea gardens.\r\n\r\nGiven a proper plough, and I feel sure a large strong bullock thus\r\nharnessed would be successful.\r\n\r\nA really good Tea garden plough has yet to be invented. All that is\r\nnecessary is to give some agricultural machinists here at home the\r\nconditions necessary for success, and I predict what we want would be\r\nsoon forthcoming. I will myself try to do so, let others do the same;\r\none of us is sure to succeed.\r\n\r\nI give all these extracts to show that many think as I do.\r\n\r\nCultivation with ploughs of any kind can never be feasible except on\r\nflat land. The hill gardens in India must in no case hope to introduce\r\nit; but I sincerely trust the planters in India who own level gardens\r\nwill not rest till they have solved the problem, and that Messrs.\r\nKinmond, Jackson, and other inventors of Tea machinery will give their\r\nvaluable aid. The following two letters from the _Tea Gazette_ show the\r\ndifficulties to be encountered in steam cultivation:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  STEAM CULTIVATION FOR TEA.\r\n\r\n  Sir,--As promised in your last issue, I now write to say that I have\r\n  received from England the catalogues and price lists of Messrs.\r\n  Howard, of Bedford, Messrs. Barford and Perkins, and other makers\r\n  of steam ploughing machinery. Messrs. Howard seem to think that\r\n  the greatest difficulty would be in lifting the return rope over\r\n  the bushes. This would be certainly a difficulty, but the idea of\r\n  steam cultivation for Tea is so valuable that it is well worth\r\n  while thinking this out. I will in your first issue for January\r\n  give a _resumé_ of all the information gleaned from the illustrated\r\n  catalogues and the letters from the engineers at home on the subject\r\n  of steam ploughing, and will then be glad to co-operate with any\r\n  gentlemen interested in Tea by giving my professional opinion and\r\n  assistance without fee in endeavouring to solve this matter. I\r\n  trust, should I ever have to write another series of articles on\r\n  Tea machinery for the _Tea Gazette_, the steam plough may figure as\r\n  one of the machines which I will have to describe as in use on Tea\r\n  gardens.\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile the principal difficulty in the way seems to be the\r\n  shifting of the long wire pulling rope over the row of bushes. Let\r\n  those interested in the subject try to devise a speedy and economical\r\n  method of doing this.--Yours, &c.,\r\n\r\n  C. B. FERGUS, C.E.\r\n\r\n  Siligori, _17th December, 1882_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  AS TO STEAM-PLOUGHING ON TEA GARDENS.\r\n\r\n  Sir,--As promised, I give you a letter regarding the question as\r\n  to whether steam-ploughing could be wholly or partially introduced\r\n  as a substitute for manual labour in Tea gardens. I have been in\r\n  communication with several of the leading makers of steam-ploughing\r\n  machinery in England, but notably with Messrs. Howard, of Bedford,\r\n  and Messrs. Barford and Perkins, of Peterborough. These gentlemen\r\n  forwarded me their illustrated catalogues in duplicate, one set of\r\n  which I sent to you.\r\n\r\n  The first question that ensues in regard to the subject is, “Would it\r\n  pay, even if found feasible?”\r\n\r\n  In Assam, Cachar, Sylhet and other places, where labour is scarce,\r\n  it is probable that the introduction of steam cultivation would be a\r\n  great boon to the Tea planter. The first cost of a steam-ploughing\r\n  apparatus with ropes, plough, and everything complete as in use in\r\n  England on what is called the “single system,” that is, working\r\n  with only one engine, is about £950. This is heavy, but as a much\r\n  lighter cultivator would be used for Tea, I think the cost might\r\n  be reduced to £800--say Rs. 10,000 on the garden. Under moderately\r\n  favourable circumstances the machinery, making all allowances for\r\n  native attendants, and the usual difficulties we have to encounter\r\n  in India through their laziness and stupidity, should cultivate 800\r\n  to 1,000 acres per month of twenty working days. The remaining ten\r\n  days might be occupied in the rains by taking the engine and gear\r\n  from place to place where it might be required; for, as the expense\r\n  of a steam-ploughing engine and apparatus would be too much for any\r\n  concern, except a very large one, to bear, I suggest that two, three,\r\n  or four gardens unite and purchase one. There need be no clashing\r\n  or quarrelling about terms at the end of the season: each should\r\n  pay his share of the cost of fuel, up-keep, wages, &c., according\r\n  to the number of days it was on each garden. It would thus be to\r\n  the interest of each manager to forward it on to the man whose turn\r\n  was next, without delay. Remember, please, that in saying that it\r\n  would cultivate so many acres in such a time, I mean that it would\r\n  cultivate two ways--that is up and down and across. There would\r\n  remain a little hand-hoeing, &c., round the inner part of the roots\r\n  of the bushes, but not much, as the cultivator I would design would\r\n  go partly underneath the laterals and still not hurt the roots, the\r\n  outer lines being much shorter than the inner ones.\r\n\r\n  Now it is a simple matter to calculate, according to the rates of\r\n  the district in which the reader may be, the comparative cost of\r\n  cultivating 1,000 acres of Tea by hand and by the steam-plough. The\r\n  plough would be worked for Tea by an 8-H. P. portable engine of\r\n  any maker’s manufacture. Wages for one engineman, one cooly to cut\r\n  wood, possibly one pair bullocks and cart-driver to bring barrels\r\n  of water, two coolies to shift the anchors, and two more to assist\r\n  them (possibly) in shifting the rope, added to the cost of fuel, and\r\n  15 per cent. per annum added for repairs and deterioration, seems\r\n  to be the cost of working. This would be lessened by the rope and\r\n  anchor-men and the woodcutter on the days when the plough was not at\r\n  work. Add, however, the cost of elephants or bullocks to take the\r\n  engine, &c., from garden to garden, and I think it will be found\r\n  that the saving in expense would be very great on the side of the\r\n  steam-plough as regards cooly labour.\r\n\r\n  Now, as to the feasibility of the scheme. It is difficult, without\r\n  the aid of plates, to describe how steam-ploughing is done. The\r\n  engine remains stationary at one corner of the field. Near it is a\r\n  large double windlass, which, when the cultivator is at work, winds\r\n  up the dragging rope with one barrel of the windlass, whilst from\r\n  the other the rope is uncoiling, which will drag the plough down the\r\n  next furrow. When the plough comes to the end of the furrow, two\r\n  men, one at each end of the rope, shift the anchors, on which are\r\n  the pulleys round which the rope runs: one furrow breadth forward\r\n  the plough is double, one set of coulters and shears being at work,\r\n  while the other set is tilted up in the air by the weight of a man\r\n  who sits on and guides the plough. When the plough is to return it is\r\n  not turned round, but the man simply tilts up into the air the set\r\n  of ploughs that have done their work, and brings down the others. Of\r\n  course ploughs like this would not do for Tea: a special cultivator\r\n  would be needed. At the end of the furrow the motion of the windlass\r\n  is reversed, and the drag rope becomes in its turn the following\r\n  rope. In England there is an ingenious mechanical contrivance for\r\n  shifting the anchors, which does away with two men, as it works\r\n  automatically. Now the greatest difficulty in the whole matter, will\r\n  be best explained to the reader in Messrs. Howard’s own language in\r\n  their letter to me. They say:--\r\n\r\n  “The obstacle to the use of steam-ploughs through rows of bushes or\r\n  trees is the practical difficulty of bringing the slack or following\r\n  rope into position for following the implement back on its return\r\n  journey. The rope cannot be lifted over the intervening row of\r\n  bushes, and to employ draught animals to take the rope up the next\r\n  alley between the bushes would add to the expense of the work, and\r\n  would impede it.” They continue: “If it is important that the land be\r\n  broken up to a depth of 9 inches, and the obstacles to effecting this\r\n  by animal power are practically insuperable, the steam plough worked\r\n  on the single system, with animals to convey the slack from end to\r\n  end of the land, would probably be the most effectual and economical\r\n  method of working.”\r\n\r\n  Now if this difficulty could be overcome (and I confess it is a\r\n  rather formidable one), I quite believe that on fairly straight land,\r\n  even if somewhat sloping, with straight rows of bushes, and the land\r\n  clear of stumps, steam cultivation would be easy. On hill gardens,\r\n  or gardens where the Tea is irregularly planted, on ground much\r\n  traversed by nullahs or having stumps left in, the steam cultivator\r\n  could not work. There may be some method of lifting the rope over\r\n  the bushes. Coolies might be stationed at intervals along the row,\r\n  and with the aid of a very light block and tackle might hoist long\r\n  bights of the rope high enough to clear the bushes. The block and\r\n  tackle would be fastened to the top of a light pole. One man would\r\n  hold the pole while the other hove up, and (the pole being midway\r\n  between the two rows) might incline it over till above the next row\r\n  and then lower away. A strong 10 ft. bamboo, a pair of light wooden\r\n  blocks, and an inch and a half Manilla rope, would be all that would\r\n  be requisite. Other projects for effecting this may strike some of\r\n  your readers, and what I want is, that those who may think the idea\r\n  of steam-ploughing of any value should co-operate together to work it\r\n  out in a practical form: I will give every assistance in my power.\r\n\r\n  We can scarcely hope, in the present depressed state of the Tea\r\n  market, that proprietors will club together to subscribe to bring\r\n  out a set of steam cultivating apparatus in order to institute\r\n  experiments on the subject. Should 1883 bring better times,\r\n  something of the sort might be done, and it is as well to have the\r\n  matter well thought out and discussed beforehand, so that should a\r\n  series of experiments take place, people would be prepared for any\r\n  contingencies which might arise, and perhaps be better prepared to\r\n  overcome these difficulties through the matter having been previously\r\n  well discussed.\r\n\r\n  It is now the season for opening out Tea gardens, and one piece of\r\n  advice I would give to planters--that is this. It is quite possible\r\n  that steam ploughing for Tea cultivation is a thing of the future,\r\n  or may be nearer than you imagine: therefore be careful to have your\r\n  lines of Tea very straight, both along and across, so that there\r\n  would be no obstacle to the plough or cultivator working. If you\r\n  object to the expense of taking out stumps, they may remain in, as\r\n  they could be taken out afterwards.\r\n\r\n  I trust your readers, Mr. Editor, will not view this subject with\r\n  indifference, but will co-operate in endeavouring to solve the\r\n  problem.--I am yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n  “TEA MACHINERY.”\r\n\r\nThough the signatures differ, I conceive Mr. C. B. Fergus, C.E., wrote\r\nthe second as well as the first. He has evidently pondered the matter\r\nwell. Let others do so too, and I foretell that the day is not far\r\ndistant when _flat_ Tea gardens will, in a great measure, be cultivated\r\nby steam or animal power. When this is so, even 8 annas (say 10_d._)\r\nper lb. for our Tea all round should pay us well.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tea Manufacturing Machinery._\r\n\r\nThe processes in Tea manufacture, as generally practised in India\r\nto-day, are--\r\n\r\n  1. Plucking.\r\n  2. Withering.\r\n  3. Sorting green leaf in a measure, and separation of Pekoe Tips.\r\n  4. Rolling.\r\n  5. Fermenting.\r\n  6. Drying or firing.\r\n  7. Sorting.\r\n  8. Final heating before packing.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 is not always done, the others invariably.\r\n\r\nI will consider the machines invented for each process, in the order of\r\nthe said processes.\r\n\r\n_Plucking._--No machine has ever been invented for this, and I do not\r\nthink any is possible.\r\n\r\n_Withering._--In any but continued wet weather no artificial means are\r\nnecessary. The leaf, spread thinly and exposed to the action of the\r\nair below and around (former attained by any kind of mesh), withers\r\nperfectly.[96] In continued wet weather artificial means are sometimes\r\nrequired. The various Dryers in use (see further on) are sometimes\r\nsupposed to furnish the means, but their use necessitates much labour,\r\nnor is the result satisfactory. A good withering machine (it must be\r\non a large scale) might, I think, be easily invented; there is none at\r\npresent. Why do none of the inventors of other Tea machinery try to\r\nsucceed in this?\r\n\r\n_Sorting Green Leaf._--This is sometimes attempted in a rough way by\r\nthe use of sieves of different meshes. To separate the fine from the\r\ncoarse leaf, and in some cases to eliminate the Pekoe tips, is the\r\nobject. A machine by John Greig and Co., of Edinburgh, professes to do\r\nthe latter. I have never seen it, but I doubt any machine abstracting\r\nthe Pekoe tips alone. A machine which would, however, separate the fine\r\nfrom the coarse leaf previous to rolling is, I think, quite feasible,\r\nand it would conduce much to good Tea. This, again, is an opening for\r\ninventors.\r\n\r\n_Rolling._--This is perhaps the most important of all processes in Tea\r\nmanufacture. The object of it is to break the cells in the Tea and\r\nliberate the sap (fermentation could not take place otherwise), and\r\nfurther to give a tight roll or twist to the leaf. Formerly this was\r\nalways done by hand (it is so done in China, I believe, to this day),\r\nbut the process was lengthy, expensive and dirty. I might perhaps add\r\ninefficient, for doubtless machine-rolled Tea is better done (better in\r\nappearance, better in liquor) than hand-rolled.\r\n\r\nI will now consider--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tea Rolling Machines._\r\n\r\nThe inventors are Jackson, Kinmond, Haworth, Lyle, Greig and Thompson.\r\nThere may be others, but I have not heard of them.\r\n\r\n_Jackson_ has invented five machines. The details of each, how much\r\neach can do, the testimonials regarding them, &c., would fill many\r\npages. All can be seen in the illustrated catalogue he supplies, so\r\nI will only offer a few general remarks. All planters know Jackson’s\r\nrollers, and they are held in high estimation. His last invention (if\r\nI mistake not) is the Rotary Tea Roller, which is on quite a different\r\nprinciple to the others. It consists of an elongated revolving barrel\r\nor cylinder, with a polygonal _internal_ surface, and a roller with a\r\nfluted _external_ surface, mounted within the said barrel its whole\r\nlength. These revolve in opposite directions (the roller the quicker)\r\nand the leaf is rolled in the annulus between. It is not yet known\r\nwhat the success of this last invention will be. Not so with his\r\nCross-action and Excelsior Rollers. These are first-rate machines, and\r\nall who have tried speak well of them.\r\n\r\n_Kinmond_ invented the first Tea roller (see page 117), many years ago.\r\nMany improvements resulted, eventually, in his “Improved Double Action\r\nTea Roller,” which is a very good machine and has given satisfaction to\r\nthe many who have used it. From all I have heard and seen, however,\r\nI doubt if, take it all in all, it is equal to Jackson’s Cross Action\r\nExcelsior. Kinmond, some two years ago, invented a “Centrifugal\r\nRoller.” It was made in two sizes. The smaller seems to have done well,\r\nnot so the larger; one of the latter on the Phoolbarry garden (in which\r\nI am interested) has proved a failure. But Mr. Kinmond has quite lately\r\nmaterially altered the said Centrifugal machines, and is confident\r\nthat they _will_ do well. He is now leaving for India with one, and\r\nanticipates good results.\r\n\r\nTea machinery is still so much in its infancy that the best machines\r\nare likely to be improved upon, and perhaps superseded by others, but\r\nas things are now, I think, though some do not agree with me, that\r\nJackson has carried off the palm in rollers.\r\n\r\nThe following two letters on rollers appeared in the _Tea Gazette_, and\r\nare well worth attention:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  KINMOND’S IMPROVED PATENT DOUBLE ACTION TEA ROLLING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n  Sir,--You have so repeatedly asked planters to supply you with\r\n  information regarding “Tea machinery” that it is a matter of surprise\r\n  to me you have not been flooded with letters on the subject. I know\r\n  very little about Tea machinery, as I am not an engineer, but I\r\n  gladly contribute my quota of knowledge on the subject. I have been\r\n  rolling leaf for some time past in one of Kinmond’s old machines,\r\n  styled his “Improved Patent Double Action Tea Rolling Machine.” A\r\n  machine for _fine_ leaf I do not believe there is in existence.\r\n  I have seen several machines at work on different factories, and\r\n  I should say for _fine_ leaf this machine of Kinmond’s cannot be\r\n  beat.[97] A few improvements could no doubt be made, and I feel sure\r\n  Mr. Kinmond himself is aware of this, and is quite competent to\r\n  make them. I have seen Mr. Kinmond’s “Compound Action Centrifugal”\r\n  at work. I do not consider it a success. It certainly cannot hold\r\n  a candle to his “Patent Double Action.” I would strongly recommend\r\n  Mr. Kinmond to improve the latter, and forego the former, unless he\r\n  can make some very material alterations to it. The roll from the\r\n  “Centrifugal” comes out hot and flat, whereas that from his “Patent\r\n  Double Action” is turned out not only perfectly cool, but has a\r\n  perfect twist.[98] For _coarse_ leaf, Jackson’s “Excelsior” is a\r\n  splendid machine. I should say a factory could not want two better\r\n  machines than one of Kinmond’s “Patent Double Action” and one of\r\n  Jackson’s “Excelsior” Rollers--the former for _fine_, the latter for\r\n  _coarse_ leaf. Will some of my brother planters kindly give their\r\n  experience, and thus further enlighten an anxious\r\n\r\n  ENQUIRER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TEA ROLLING MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir,--I will be glad if some of your numerous readers will\r\n  kindly furnish results of trials, or of experience, of Kinmond’s\r\n  Compound Action Centrifugal Tea Rolling Machine. I have tried it\r\n  repeatedly, and find it not only heats the green leaf a great deal\r\n  too much, but in addition cuts, I may say into mincemeat, about 5%\r\n  of the leaf in the process of rolling. I am not an engineer, and\r\n  therefore cannot state for certain where the fault lies, but I fancy\r\n  the ribs of the two revolving plates are somewhat at fault. If they\r\n  were broader and bolder, the machine might, perhaps, be a better\r\n  success. The green leaf does not come out sufficiently rolled. The\r\n  major portion of the roll is too flat. Perhaps Mr. Kinmond will\r\n  kindly help by giving a hint or two to a perplexed Tea-house\r\n\r\n  “ASSISTANT.”\r\n\r\n_Haworth’s Roller._--This machine was invented long ago. The leaf is\r\nplaced in bags and so rolled. In some respects the machine resembles\r\na mangle. It has not been largely used, and thus is not much known.\r\nI have no personal experience of its worth, but have heard much of\r\nit from an old friend of mine, Mr. Carter, of the Chandpore Tea\r\nEstate, Chittagong. He has, I believe, had one from the first on his\r\nplantation, and thinks very well of it. Mr. Carter is a first-rate\r\njudge on all Tea matters. He conducted some experiments to test the\r\nvalue of Tea rolled by Jackson’s and Haworth’s Rollers, and did it with\r\ngreat care, that the quality of leaf, the withering, the drying, all\r\nbut the two modes of rolling should be _exactly_ the same. The samples\r\nwere then sent to Calcutta and valued. Results as below:--\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Carritt and Co.’s report on the samples is dated Calcutta,\r\n  29th October, 1881, _viz._:--\r\n\r\n  Chandpore leaf rolled by Haworth’s machine:--Large irregular open\r\n  unassorted leaf, brisk, fair flavour, little strong--Re. 0-9-9.\r\n\r\n  Chandpore leaf rolled by Jackson’s machine:--Leaf preferable, closer\r\n  rolled, liquor inferior, not very strong--Re. 0-9-0.\r\n\r\n  Sungoo leaf rolled by Haworth’s machine:--Rather large irregular\r\n  loosely twisted unassorted leaf, flavoury, little brisk--Re. 0-9-3.\r\n\r\n  Sungoo leaf rolled by Jackson’s machine:--Leaf little preferable,\r\n  liquor inferior, wanting briskness--Re. 0-8-9.\r\n\r\nBy above it appears Haworth’s gave better liquor, and Jackson’s the\r\nbest Tea in appearance. From all I have heard I think it likely\r\nHaworth’s roller has not received the attention it deserves.\r\n\r\n_Lyle’s Roller._--I have never seen this. From the drawing before me\r\nit has no resemblance to other rollers. The inventor claims for it\r\nsimplicity, cheapness, strength, durability, good rolling, and large\r\noutturn with a minimum of labour. One testimonial I have seen speaks\r\nvery highly of its capabilities.\r\n\r\n_Greig’s Roller._--This I have not seen or heard of. I can only give\r\nthe description sent me by the inventor:--\r\n\r\n  The Greig Link and Lever Tea Rolling Machine, worked by one man,\r\n  and suitable for rolling the finest nibs without breaking them, or\r\n  to crush the coarsest leaf into broken black at will. It can roll\r\n  a large or small quantity equally well. Price £70, delivered in\r\n  Edinburgh. Small size suitable for cattle gear, £45. Cattle gear,\r\n  £20, delivered in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n  The Calcutta Agent of the Luckea Moung Lung Tea Estate, Sonada,\r\n  Darjeeling, in sending remittance for a large size machine which has\r\n  been working there all the past season, says: “I am informed the\r\n  machine does its work in a most satisfactory manner, rolling better\r\n  than by hand: I am pleased to have to state this.”\r\n\r\n_Thompson’s Challenge Roller._--This (quite lately invented) though\r\ngiven last is likely, by all I hear, to stand well among rollers.\r\nI have no drawing or description of it, but _why_ I think well of\r\nit is that a Tea engineer, Mr. Ansell, of Kurseong, who thoroughly\r\nunderstands Tea machinery, thinks so highly of the machine that he\r\nhas recommended its purchase by the Phoolbarry Tea Company. I have\r\nevery faith in Mr. Ansell’s judgment, and feel confident therefore the\r\nmachine must be a good one. One feature and advantage claimed for it\r\nis, “free contact of the leaf throughout the roll with the outer air.”\r\n\r\nI may conclude my remarks on rollers with a quaint letter (from _Tea\r\nGazette_) by a native. If he can judge of Tea machinery as well as he\r\ncan write English his opinion is worth preserving:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  TEA ROLLING MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir--On the subject of Tea-leaf rolling machinery, the (to all\r\n  appearance) strangely opposite results I have obtained from machines\r\n  of the same make have led me to the following conclusions, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  1. All “genuses” of machines are equally good.\r\n\r\n  2. There are hardly two “species” of the same genus which give\r\n  similar results.\r\n\r\n  3. Changing the “fixings” of a machine makes all the difference in\r\n  the world.\r\n\r\n  _Ergo_ a good mechanic will have a good machine whether he patronize\r\n  Jackson, Kinmond, Haworth, or any other inventor.\r\n\r\n  I think with your correspondent “A Voice from Assam” that the machine\r\n  that gives the roll quickly, and in a continuous supply, is the best.\r\n\r\n  I would defy any man to prove that any _inventor_ has it “all his own\r\n  way,” for I certainly have not found it so in my experience.\r\n\r\n  Yours truly,\r\n      KOL MISTRY.\r\n\r\nBefore going to press I received drawing and description of “Thompson’s\r\nChallenge Roller.” It is impossible to judge of its merits by the\r\ndrawing, but some very strong testimonials are appended--one much in\r\nits favour from Mr. Ansell, the Tea engineer above mentioned. By the\r\ntestimonials (more than one from men I know) the following advantages\r\nappear to have been obtained:--\r\n\r\n  “Balling” of the leaf is avoided.\r\n  The tips are kept quite bright.\r\n  Heating prevented.\r\n  Simplicity of “feed” and “discharge.”\r\n  One attendant, a minimum of motive power, and low priced.\r\n  A good twist attained.\r\n  Simplicity in the machine, and ease of transport and erection.\r\n\r\n_If_ all the above are facts, I quite think the “Challenge” will prove\r\na great success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following, written by me to the _Tea Gazette_, may be worth the\r\nattention of Tea-rolling machine inventors:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING THE DRUMS AND THE FACES OF THE ROLLERS IN\r\n  TEA ROLLING MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n  Sir,--The following idea, suggested to me by a planter up here,\r\n  may be practicable or not, but in any case it is worth letting the\r\n  patentees of Tea-rolling machines know it.\r\n\r\n  In days gone by when iron worked in contact with iron on the faces of\r\n  rollers the colour of the outturn (that is the infused Tea leaves)\r\n  was quite destroyed. That is now remedied, but there is still an evil\r\n  of less importance. The wood on the said faces of the rollers absorbs\r\n  the sap of the leaf, and unless they are washed very clean, the said\r\n  old sap is apt to contaminate, more or less, the new leaf. Could not\r\n  this be rectified by making the faces of the rollers of porcelain or\r\n  iron (like camp crockery) and the drums of opaque coarse glass? Both\r\n  these, if they would stand, could easily be washed quite clean.\r\n\r\n  I give the idea, given to me, for what it is worth, and would invite\r\n  the opinion of other planters on it.\r\n\r\n  EDWARD MONEY.\r\n\r\n  Darjeeling, _November 10th, 1880_.\r\n\r\n_Fermenting_ is the next process in the list. After the leaf is rolled\r\nit is put together; some make it up in truncated balls, some put it\r\nin baskets, but in either case it is allowed to stand until a given\r\namount of fermentation has set in. This is done in the warm atmosphere\r\nof the factory. Naturally no machine is required for this process;\r\nbut shelves, at varying height from the factory floor, are useful to\r\nregulate the fermentation, inasmuch as the higher the shelf the warmer\r\nthe air, and warmth hastens the process. This plan of shelves was\r\ndevised by Mr. J. Fleming, at the Phoolbarry Garden, and it seemed to\r\nme to answer well.\r\n\r\n_Drying_ or _Firing_ comes next. Up to this point the leaf is of a\r\nbrownish green colour, and soft. After the drying it is black and\r\ncrisp, in fact, made Tea. By the drying process all the moisture in\r\nthe mass is driven off. For many years charcoal only was used to fire\r\nTea, and it was an established belief that _the fumes_ given out by\r\nthe said charcoal had some chemical effect on the Tea--in fact, that\r\ngood Tea could not be made without it. When, twelve years ago, I\r\npublished the First Edition of this Essay, I had begun to doubt the\r\nsoundness of the above belief, and four years later I had thoroughly\r\nsatisfied myself of its fallacy. It was not, however, till 1877-78 that\r\nI devised _a means_ of firing Teas without charcoal. The invention\r\nwas well received, and thought well of. At all events, it _proved_\r\nwhat I had long urged--viz., that any fuel, if contact with the smoke\r\nwas avoided, would dry Tea. My invention was a very crude one, and\r\nquickly superseded by far more perfect designs; still I have the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that on this head I have done much to perfect\r\nTea manufacture, and that the conviction I had attained to in 1874 is\r\nnow general and practised throughout India. (Pages 119-121, 295, to end\r\nof Addenda, bear out the above remarks.)\r\n\r\nI will now consider the various\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tea-Drying Machines_.\r\n\r\n_Robertson’s Typhoon._--This is a late invention: it was noticed in the\r\n_Tea Gazette_ in 1881. It had, however, made a great noise at end of\r\n1880, and so well was it spoken of, many, in the early part of 1881,\r\npurchased it. The following was the report as to its merits (_Tea\r\nGazette_, September, 1881):--\r\n\r\n\r\n  ROBERTSON’S TYPHOON.\r\n\r\n  Mr. J. M. Robertson, manager of the Arcuttipore Tea Company’s\r\n  Gardens, has invented a new Tea-drying apparatus which he has named\r\n  the “Typhoon.” A number of the planters of his district met at his\r\n  garden, by invitation, to test the merits of his machine. We quote\r\n  the verdict recorded by them in their own words, and also append the\r\n  brokers’ report on the Teas which were manufactured in their presence\r\n  during the trial.\r\n\r\n  The “Typhoon” is a simple and inexpensive construction of brick\r\n  and iron, which can be erected without skilled labour. The heating\r\n  material used is coke, and the quantity of coke required for a maund\r\n  of Tea is stated to be one quarter of a maund.\r\n\r\n  The out-turn from the “Typhoon” we found to be at the rate of one\r\n  half maund of thoroughly dried Tea per hour, and the manner in which\r\n  the work was done was to our entire satisfaction, some of us thinking\r\n  that the apparatus was capable of doing more.\r\n\r\n  The inventor leads us to understand that the entire cost of\r\n  construction and material will not be over Rs. 300, and we do not see\r\n  that this sum need be exceeded.\r\n\r\n  We are unanimously of opinion that unless the dryers at present in\r\n  use are very materially reduced in price, they will be beaten off the\r\n  field by the “Typhoon.”\r\n\r\n  Messrs. William Moran & Co.’s report on the Teas is as follows:--\r\n\r\n                          Typhoon Teas.           London      Cal. Equi.\r\n                                                  value.     Ex. 1-8-1/2.\r\n  Pekoe, very well made leaf, with ends, good\r\n    brisk flavour                                   1 10        14\r\n  Orange Pekoe, very well twisted leaf, good\r\n    amount of tip, very good brisk flavour          2  0        15-1/4\r\n  Br. Pekoe, leafy black Br. Pekoe, some\r\n    ends strong                                     2  1         1\r\n  Pekoe Souchong, well twisted leaf, some ends\r\n    good flavour                                    1  3         9\r\n  Souchong, small good even grey leaf, brisk        1  1         7-1/2\r\n\r\n  The above are very desirable Teas as regards leaf and liquor.\r\n\r\n  The following are some of the chief features and advantages of this\r\n  machine:\r\n\r\n  1. The low cost.\r\n\r\n  2. Durability, there being nothing except the trays that can suffer\r\n  from wear and tear.\r\n\r\n  3. The small quantity of fuel required--about 1/4 maund of coke for\r\n  kutcha firing 1 maund of Tea.\r\n\r\n  4. Ease in stoking, the furnace not requiring attention oftener than\r\n  once every one and a-half to two hours.\r\n\r\n  5. Absolute and immediate control over the temperature, which can be\r\n  raised or lowered instantaneously.\r\n\r\n  6. No “getting up heat” required. In fifteen minutes after beginning\r\n  to light the fire the apparatus is ready for work.\r\n\r\n  7. Requires no troublesome cleaning out.\r\n\r\n  8. Quantity. The apparatus is capable of drying at least 40 lbs. an\r\n  hour, and has frequently dried over 50 lbs.\r\n\r\n  9. Quality of Tea is equal to that obtained by any process hitherto\r\n  introduced.\r\n\r\nOf course all the above was very favourable, and its low price gained\r\nit many purchasers. I think, as a _first_ success, it beat any machine\r\nyet invented. But, alas! its fall was sudden as its rise, for, judging\r\nfrom several letters in the _Tea Gazette_, the purchasers were not\r\nsatisfied with its capabilities, and I doubt consequently if it is now\r\nmanufactured; still I may be wrong.\r\n\r\n_Allen’s Tea Drying Apparatus._--I have never seen this, and have not\r\nheard much about it. Advantages claimed for it are--1. Quick drying.\r\n2. Coke can be used as a drying agent, 10 seers to one maund of Tea.\r\n3. Only manual labour required. 4. Not necessary to turn the Tea. 5.\r\nPerfect control over temperature. I have three testimonials to its\r\nmerits before me, one from an engineer, and all three speak highly of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from the inventor to the _Tea Gazette_ gives\r\nfurther information:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  ALLEN’S PATENT DRYING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir,--Some time back your valuable paper contained a description\r\n  and rough drawing of my Patent Drying Machine. I now beg to say that\r\n  the machine is in the market.\r\n\r\n  I will simply state here that it can dry one maund of Tea per hour,\r\n  or about equivalent to four maunds of leaf.\r\n\r\n  It cannot burn the Tea as in other machines, yet it thoroughly dries\r\n  it at one fill of the machine.\r\n\r\n  It takes half a maund of Tea at each fill, and every leaf of this is\r\n  done in exactly the same time; no turning over, changing of trays, or\r\n  further looking after the Tea, after the roll has been placed in the\r\n  machine on the trays.\r\n\r\n  Temperature can be lowered from 300° to 100° in two or three seconds,\r\n  and run up again in five to seven minutes.\r\n\r\n  It will burn any fuel. Fireplace 2-1/2′ × 3′, when kept regularly\r\n  three quarters full of firewood or coal about 6 to 8 inches thick,\r\n  while machine is drying, will suffice (half a maund of fuel to a\r\n  maund of Tea should be ample). The appearance and fine flavour of\r\n  Tea dried in this machine by fan beats charcoal; no gloss is lost on\r\n  the Tea from shaking up and turning over, and the Tea is black, with\r\n  glossy appearance and good flavour.\r\n\r\n  The following are valuation and reports on this machine’s dried Tea,\r\n  by Messrs. William Moran and Co., to whom some of bulk or rough Tea\r\n  was sent.--Yours, &c.,\r\n\r\n  J. C. ALLEN.\r\n\r\nI omitted to extract the broker’s reports, but they were favourable.\r\nI think it likely this Dryer is well suited to small gardens, which\r\ncannot afford steam motive power.\r\n\r\n_Davidson’s Sirocco._--Many of these, over 200, have been set up in all\r\nthe Tea districts; it has done good work in its time: had it not done\r\nso it would not so long (some years) have commanded attention. When it\r\ncame out it was, I think, the best machine going. I doubt much that\r\nbeing the case now. It requires no motive power, and is thus, in that\r\nrespect, cheap to work. The following letter to the _Tea Gazette_ in\r\nmany respects embodies my views of the machine:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE SIROCCO.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir,--As both sides of a question, _viz._ for and against,\r\n  should be stated before the public for their judgment, I think I\r\n  may say that, as far as we have seen _in print_, the “Sirocco” is a\r\n  “first rate Tea-drying machine.” I beg to state that _all_ does not\r\n  appear in print, though what does appear there may be quite true,\r\n  and quite right too for the seller to get as many sales of it as he\r\n  can, for who would be such an ass as to cry down his own invention\r\n  or anything else he wished to profit by. The “Sirocco,” as I have\r\n  seen (and I have seen over ten, and amongst them the latest improved\r\n  ones), does not thoroughly fire off the Tea without burning it: the\r\n  Tea must be taken out of the machine when three parts fired, and\r\n  allowed to cool, when its own heat, and the fact of it being gathered\r\n  in one place, give sufficient heat to finish the kutcha firing, but\r\n  pucka batti is required after that. Again, the advertisement would\r\n  lead one to suppose that the drying is effected by means of the\r\n  draught of hot air entirely: now if this were the case, when the\r\n  fires are first lighted in the machine, the hot air would at once\r\n  be of sufficient heat to dry Tea; but this is not the case, for the\r\n  whole iron work, in fact, the whole apparatus, iron work, &c., has\r\n  to be heated up by fire, and when a little off red hot, the Tea is\r\n  put in and fired. I do not mean to say that hot air does not ascend\r\n  through the Tea, but I contend that the heat of the iron has more\r\n  to do with the drying; there is no detriment to the Tea, I feel\r\n  convinced, whether it is dried by hot iron or hot air, but there is a\r\n  very considerable detriment to the machine. Let purchasers ask any\r\n  engineer, or even blacksmith, how quickly iron burns away, and he can\r\n  tell them.\r\n\r\n  Up to date no doubt the “Sirocco” has seen its run: over 200 are\r\n  advertised as in use, but it is now beaten by two machines which\r\n  have come out lately, and which beat the “Sirocco” entirely as to\r\n  quantity dried and simplicity of working, and for durability should\r\n  last any time by careful looking after. One is Robertson’s, which is\r\n  firebrick, and the other Allen’s; both these machines for durability\r\n  cannot be surpassed: the difference in results between the two is,\r\n  that one dries every tray of Tea in the same time without turning\r\n  over, and the other requires to have the Tea turned over and the\r\n  trays changed, &c., as in the “Sirocco.”\r\n\r\n  The “Sirocco,” no doubt, was a good Tea-drying machine in its time,\r\n  and the inventor deserves the greatest credit for it, but it has been\r\n  improved upon, as is always inevitably the case in machinery.\r\n\r\n  I trust no offence will be taken by the “Sirocco” inventor, as such\r\n  is not intended. Any answer of his will be gladly read.\r\n\r\n  Cachar.       Yours faithfully,       PUCKA TEA.\r\n\r\nThere may have been an answer, but I did not see it.\r\n\r\n_Gibbs and Barry’s Tea Dryer._--This machine has been lately invented.\r\nI saw it when not as complete as it is now. I have tried to get\r\ndetails, but failed. It must have merit, however, for though a late\r\nmachine, some thirty-six are now in operation; I heard one good judge\r\nspeak very well of it. More are, I hear, being despatched to India. No\r\ntrays are used with this Dryer.\r\n\r\n_Shand’s Dryer._--This hails from Ceylon. Steam for drying Tea is not\r\nquite a new idea. I saw an apparatus to use steam in Cachar years ago.\r\nThe great advantage claimed for this Dryer is that Tea cannot be burnt.\r\nIt is quite a new invention. This, from the _Tea Gazette_, describes\r\nit:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  A NEW TEA DRYER.\r\n\r\n  A gentleman in Colombo, Ceylon, a Mr. C. Shand, as we mentioned in\r\n  our last, has invented a new patent Tea Dryer. The following is a\r\n  description of his invention:--\r\n\r\n  The barbacue-shaped steam-heated Tea Dryer is the cheapest, most\r\n  economical and safest drying machine.\r\n\r\n  As this machine can be made any length and width, the quantity of\r\n  leaf which can be manufactured is only limited by the extent of\r\n  drying surface. One, 5 feet wide, and 15 feet long, will admit of\r\n  about forty pounds of Tea being spread as thinly as on Sirocco trays,\r\n  and, if heated to 150° Fahrenheit, would dry a maund per hour. The\r\n  steam for heating thin galvanized iron drying surface is generated in\r\n  the space (3 inches) between it and the thin boiler plate bottom.\r\n\r\n  The machine, which is made steam-tight, is partially filled with\r\n  water, and placed on a fire stove. It is evident that a comparatively\r\n  small quantity of fuel will generate sufficient steam to heat a large\r\n  surface, especially if the smoke flue is placed under the whole\r\n  length of the machine.\r\n\r\n  As it is impossible to fire-burn the Tea, dried by the steam-heated\r\n  Dryer, the enormous advantage of being independent of the care and\r\n  judgment of coolies, and of the necessity of uninterrupted European\r\n  supervision, is too evident to require comment.\r\n\r\n  Then comes the figure of the Dryer with the following note:--\r\n\r\n  “Barbacue-shaped Tea Dryer.--The far end should be slightly higher\r\n  than that over the fire, to allow the space over it to be full of\r\n  water.\r\n\r\n  An apparatus for escape of steam and supplying water is inserted in\r\n  the end plate covering the boiler.”\r\n\r\n  The _Ceylon Observer_, referring to the above, asks the following\r\n  questions:--\r\n\r\n  Is it really impossible by means of steam to over-heat, though we may\r\n  not, indeed cannot, “fire-burn” Tea? And when a boiler is employed\r\n  to generate steam, do we become quite independent of the care and\r\n  judgment of coolies, and avoid the necessity of uninterrupted\r\n  European supervision? Will not a thermometer be necessary to indicate\r\n  the proper degree of heat, will it not require close watching, and\r\n  will there not be danger of the boiler exploding if neglected? The\r\n  danger may be reduced to a minimum, but we should be glad of proof\r\n  that it cannot exist.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Shand in reply writes--With reference to your remarks and queries\r\n  regarding my Tea-drying machine, will you allow me to mention that,\r\n  as it is not intended to sustain any pressure of steam, the drying\r\n  surface cannot easily be heated over 150 degrees.\r\n\r\n  As a matter of course, the Tea takes a longer time to dry than when\r\n  made by Siroccos, in which the temperature is maintained at 275\r\n  degrees, but the extent of drying surface available makes this a\r\n  matter of secondary importance.\r\n\r\n  I did not mean that no care or attention is required to keep up\r\n  fire and supply boiling water periodically from a cistern placed\r\n  over the flue; but you can understand that the same care, judgment\r\n  and observation is not required to dry Tea at a comparatively low\r\n  temperature as at a very high one: for instance, it does not injure\r\n  coffee to allow it to remain on the barbacue after it is thoroughly\r\n  dry; but put it in a roaster, and what care and judgment is not\r\n  required to perfect the roasting!\r\n\r\n  No doubt, by the use of Siroccos and other modern appliances,\r\n  the risk of fire-burning is now greatly diminished, but these\r\n  still require great care in shifting the trays and watching the\r\n  thermometer. This constant watching is obviated by the use of my\r\n  machine, and all the superintendent has to do is to feel when the Tea\r\n  becomes crisp and dry. He has the security that, if this is neglected\r\n  to be done at the moment it is sufficiently dry, no injury takes\r\n  place by its remaining on the heated surface.\r\n\r\n  The machine is especially adapted for redrying Tea before packing,\r\n  this being an operation carried on at a low temperature, and\r\n  requiring a good deal of care.\r\n\r\n  There are, it is well known, two difficulties connected with the\r\n  proper manufacture of Tea, requiring at present the constant\r\n  supervision of the superintendent: these are fermentation and\r\n  firing. If the necessity of closely watching the latter can be\r\n  dispensed with, it gives the superintendents more time to direct\r\n  the fermentation, on which the colour of the infused leaf, and\r\n  consequently the value, so greatly depends.\r\n\r\nI have now considered all the Dryers I know of except Kinmond’s and\r\nJackson’s. I have purposely left these to the last. While in the case\r\nof Rollers I thought Jackson had done best, in Dryers I most decidedly\r\naward the first place to Kinmond.\r\n\r\n_Jackson’s Dryer._--A long and exhaustive report upon it from Mr.\r\nCarter, of the Chandpore Garden, Chittagong, appears in the _Tea\r\nGazette_, November 7, 1881. It is too long to insert here. No one can\r\nread it and doubt that the trials were most carefully conducted, and\r\nwithout bias of any kind. The results are not in favour of the machine.\r\nMoreover, were Jackson’s Dryers a real success I should have been aware\r\nof the fact long ago. I incline to the belief Mr. Jackson thinks he\r\ncan do better, for he has lately brought out a Self-acting Tea Dryer\r\nregarding which the following appeared in the _Tea Gazette_:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  JACKSON’S NEW SELF-ACTING TEA DRYER.\r\n\r\n  Messrs. W. and J. Jackson have invented a new apparatus that will\r\n  deal with the Tea itself throughout the drying process, and thus,\r\n  they submit, secure a perfection in the dessication of the leaf not\r\n  hitherto obtained. The objects arrived at by the new invention are as\r\n  follows:--\r\n\r\n  1.--After the leaf is fed into the machine it requires no more\r\n  attention until it is discharged dry.\r\n\r\n  2.--Every individual leaf is simultaneously exposed in precisely a\r\n  similar manner to the action of the heated air, thus producing an\r\n  unvaried and perfectly even dried leaf.\r\n\r\n  3.--The Tea is steadily but very slowly kept in motion, thereby\r\n  dispensing with the tedious and tiring watchfulness of attendants,\r\n  hitherto required in Tea drying on the tray system.\r\n\r\n  4.--There are no trays about the machine to handle, and it is,\r\n  therefore, thoroughly durable and cannot get out of order.\r\n\r\n  In operating with the machine, a boy or attendant has simply to\r\n  spread the leaf on a slowly moving feeding web or band, which carries\r\n  it forward and places it in the machine, where it is steadily but\r\n  inactively kept in motion, and in due course is discharged dry and\r\n  crisp from a shoot at the delivery end; so long, therefore, as\r\n  the attendant continues to supply the machine with leaf, it will\r\n  steadily dry and discharge it, and should he have occasion to leave\r\n  the machine at any time, no injury can take place to the leaf in the\r\n  apparatus, as it must pass on and be discharged.\r\n\r\n  The leaf is continuously, but very slowly, turned over, disentangled\r\n  and individually presented to the action of the heated air by a\r\n  peculiar combination of concentric cylinders, thus ensuring not only\r\n  the most uniform fermentation, but the drying of each leaf being\r\n  simultaneously effected alike must produce an unvaried briskness and\r\n  quality of liquor not obtainable from any of the methods of drying at\r\n  present known.\r\n\r\n  The machine will dry about forty maunds of green leaf per day, and\r\n  will be approximately 9′ long, 3-1/2′ wide, and 8′ high.\r\n\r\n  The apparatus will take very little driving, which can either be\r\n  effected by steam or hand power. It is very simple, easily erected,\r\n  and self-contained.\r\n\r\nI know nothing about this new Dryer beyond what is printed above, and I\r\nrather doubt if any have yet been set up. _If_ the advantages detailed\r\nare truly all realised, they are doubtless of much value.\r\n\r\n_Kinmond’s Dryer._--I shall devote extra space to this, for I _believe_\r\nin it. I have seen it working for a long time on the Phoolbarry Garden,\r\nand I continue since I left India to receive good reports of it. This\r\nis what the inventor himself says of it recently:--\r\n\r\n  This Tea-drying machine continues to give great satisfaction. The\r\n  improvements made last year considerably increased the out-turn of\r\n  Tea, and reduced the amount of fuel required. Further improvements\r\n  have this year been introduced in fastening the iron plates at the\r\n  corners of the trays with copper rivets, and otherwise strengthening\r\n  the trays, remedying many small defects suggested by planters who\r\n  are using the Dryers, and in improving the arrangement of the\r\n  fire-bricks over the furnace. The latter, as well as some of the\r\n  smaller alterations, were suggested by Mr. Ansell (inventor of the\r\n  sifting machine which bears his name), an engineer who has had great\r\n  experience in and around Darjeeling in erecting and working all the\r\n  three sizes of these Dryers.\r\n\r\n  This is the only Tea-drying machine which can keep pace with the\r\n  largest rolling machines. It is made in three sizes. The capacity of\r\n  the smallest or No. 1 Dryer is one maund of pucka Tea per hour. The\r\n  capacity of No. 2 Dryer is two maunds per hour, and that of No. 3\r\n  Dryer is three maunds per hour. The consumption of fuel is less than\r\n  one maund of wood fuel to one maund of pucka Tea dried.\r\n\r\n  One of the great advantages of this Tea Dryer is the facility it\r\n  gives for _final firing_ before packing. The enhanced price of Tea\r\n  which has been dried and final fired in this Dryer is well shewn in\r\n  the high average of 1_s._ 6_d._ per lb., which the Scottish Assam\r\n  Company’s Teas have fetched this season. See letters annexed from\r\n  their superintendent in Assam, Mr. Cruickshanks, and their secretary\r\n  in Edinburgh, Mr. Moffat.\r\n\r\n  When _final_ firing Tea with the Dryer, it is found convenient to\r\n  place a fine gauze cover over the top trays in each compartment, to\r\n  prevent any of the Tea dust being carried away with the hot air which\r\n  passes through the Tea.\r\n\r\n  In order to get the maximum quantity of work from the Dryer, the\r\n  trays must be spread with rolled leaf twice as thick as that used\r\n  when Tea is dried over charcoal, where there is no forced current of\r\n  air, and after the Tea has been _half-dried_, then the Tea on _two_\r\n  trays should be spread on _one_ tray, and the drying finished. In\r\n  the Dryers now in course of construction, the trays have been made\r\n  one-half deeper, so that the half-dried Tea on _three_ trays should\r\n  be finished in _one_ tray. The out-turn of the machine is greatly\r\n  diminished when the foregoing method is not observed; and owing to\r\n  its non-observance, many of the Dryers in use have never been worked\r\n  to their greatest capacity.\r\n\r\n  The Dryer should be lined outside with one thickness of bricks--they\r\n  are the cheapest and best non-conductors of heat--inferior or\r\n  badly-burned bricks may be used. Both ends of the Dryer should be\r\n  lined, and both sides and elbows as high as the trays. The top may\r\n  either have a lining of bricks, or four inches thick of sand or\r\n  clay. When the Dryer is lined round with bricks, it not only greatly\r\n  reduces the consumption of fuel, but by preventing the radiation of\r\n  heat, it enables the men to increase the out-turn of pucka Tea.\r\n\r\n  The Dryer is extremely simple and compact--the No. 2 size occupies\r\n  a space of about 7 feet long and 3 feet wide. The fan of this Dryer\r\n  requires about half a horse-power to drive it.\r\n\r\n  The fan should be driven at a speed of 500 revolutions per minute.\r\n  The pulley on the fan spindle is 7-1/2 inches diameter and 4 inches\r\n  wide.\r\n\r\n  Owing to the satisfaction given by these Dryers this season, an\r\n  exceptionally large number of orders are on hand, and although a\r\n  number of each size is generally kept in stock, the patentee will be\r\n  obliged to those requiring Dryers for next season to kindly send in\r\n  their orders early.\r\n\r\n  No. 1 Dryer, capable of drying one maund of pucka Tea per hour, £150;\r\n  No. 2 Dryer, capable of drying two maunds of pucka Tea per hour,\r\n  £220; No. 3 Dryer, capable of drying three maunds of pucka Tea per\r\n  hour, £300. These prices are f.o.b. in London.\r\n\r\n  London Agents--Messrs. Geo. Williamson and Co., 7, East India Avenue;\r\n  Calcutta Agents--Messrs. Williamson, Magor and Co., 4, Mangoe Lane.\r\n\r\nThe best of the three sizes is No. 3. I have quite lately sent out two\r\nof them, one for the Phoolbarry, one for the Leesh Company’s Gardens,\r\nboth in the Western Dooars. I think the prices are much too high, and\r\nmight with advantage (to both inventor and planters) be reduced; but\r\nas to the excellence of the machine there can, I think, be no doubt.\r\nMy opinion is shared by many. I have before me many testimonials as to\r\nits excellence. Space forbids me inserting them here, but Mr. Kinmond\r\nor his agents will send them on application.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1881, so satisfied was I even then with the Dryer (both the\r\nmanager, Mr. Pillans, at Phoolbarry, and I am still more so _now_), I\r\nwrote the following to the _Tea Gazette_, and I give it here as details\r\nare embodied:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  KINMOND’S TEA DRYER.\r\n\r\n  To all interested in Tea in India, and their name is legion, Tea\r\n  manufacturing machinery and its capabilities must be a subject of\r\n  great interest.\r\n\r\n  Though Tea prices may, and I think to a certain extent will, revive,\r\n  the old scale which existed previous to the late serious fall\r\n  will never probably return. How serious the fall has been will be\r\n  appreciated when I state that gardens which previously realised 14\r\n  annas to 1 rupee for their produce think now they do well if they\r\n  obtain an average of 10 annas. Thus, an average of 12 annas (even\r\n  if the partial rise I hope for takes place) will probably be more\r\n  than most Indian plantations will get in the future. In two words,\r\n  the Tea industry of India is passing through a period of depression\r\n  and a crisis which argues “the survival of the fittest.” Not only\r\n  must plantations, destined to last, produce largely, they must\r\n  also make good Teas at a small cost. This latter, I hold, both as\r\n  regards quality and economy, _can_ only be attained by the use of\r\n  machinery; and thus, what is the best kind of rolling machine, the\r\n  best description of dryer, equaliser, and sifting apparatus, is an\r\n  all-important point.\r\n\r\n  Tea machinery is still quite in its infancy. Various as are the\r\n  machines in use, and superior as some are to others, perhaps none of\r\n  them are yet quite perfect. Still, planters cannot afford to wait\r\n  for ultimate perfection, for though any machines bought to-day will\r\n  probably be more or less out of date in a few years’ time, he who\r\n  waits _must_ go to the wall in the meanwhile. Realising this fact, as\r\n  those who know the subject do, they (and they are many) ask eagerly:--\r\n\r\n  “Which of the several machines for the different processes in Tea\r\n  manufacture shall we buy?”\r\n\r\n  I have not now, perhaps, the knowledge to discuss fairly the several\r\n  merits of the various machines for each different process, but as Tea\r\n  Dryers hold an important place in the list, and I have, perhaps, an\r\n  exceptional experience of one kind, I purpose to give your readers\r\n  the benefit thereof.\r\n\r\n  Years ago, when I first mooted the idea that Tea could be fired\r\n  without charcoal, it was scouted. It was said, “The fumes of charcoal\r\n  had some chemical and necessary effect.” “The Chinese would not\r\n  have used it from time immemorial had a substitute, and a cheaper\r\n  one, been practicable.” Such were the objections. It is now no\r\n  longer a question. A great part, perhaps the greater part, of the\r\n  Indian produce is to-day worked with other fuel, and it is only\r\n  a question of time when _all_ of it will be so. It is generally\r\n  admitted that Tea prepared in Dryers is more valuable than that fired\r\n  over charcoal; and begging the question that the fumes of charcoal\r\n  are _not_ necessary (the old idea is very nearly exploded), it is\r\n  reasonable that it should be so; for, if there is one thing certain\r\n  in Tea manufacture, it is that speed is necessary. Charcoal drying\r\n  took on an average 45 minutes; Tea is fired in the best Dryers in\r\n  eight minutes. In respect of speed, Kinmond’s Dryer (which is the one\r\n  I advocate) is certainly unequalled.\r\n\r\n  When, as in large factories, 30 or 40 maunds of Tea have to be made\r\n  daily, it is evident that, _cæteris paribus_, the machine which will\r\n  do most in a given time and given space must be the best. In these\r\n  respects also Kinmond’s Dryer stands well, for the small size (No.\r\n  1) will do one maund, and the larger size (No. 2) will turn out two\r\n  maunds per hour. In other words, in a working day of 12 hours (and I\r\n  allow no more, for I do not believe in night work) 12 and 24 maunds\r\n  daily are the capacities of the two sizes. Considering that the said\r\n  two sizes, with necessary stokehole, tables, &c., occupy respectively\r\n  not more than 200 and 260 square feet of space in a factory, the\r\n  satisfactory results, in both the above respects, are unquestionable.\r\n\r\n  Tea made at night, both because the colour of it in its different\r\n  stages cannot be well seen (let the light be what it will), and also\r\n  because superintendence cannot then be so close, is never so good as\r\n  day-made Tea. This is _why_ I do not believe in night work; and it is\r\n  also a very important extra reason why machinery (which by its speed\r\n  enables all the necessary Tea to be made by daylight) will prove such\r\n  a great and lasting advantage.\r\n\r\n  When Kinmond’s Dryer was first constructed, it was proposed to work\r\n  it at 300 degrees. Later experience has proved 260 degrees is better\r\n  and sufficient; but of course more time is thus taken, and with the\r\n  old sizes one and two maunds per hour could not be turned out at the\r\n  lower temperature. The machines are now made one-fifth larger to\r\n  obviate this.\r\n\r\n  The fan is worked at 600 revolutions per minute, and this is found to\r\n  be the best speed.\r\n\r\n  Several alterations, and important ones, have been made since the\r\n  first machines were constructed, but I will mention them shortly,\r\n  for they will only be understood by those who know the Dryer--1. The\r\n  trays now take out alternately both sides. 2. The fine Tea or dhole\r\n  trays take out independently. 3. Outside bearings are supplied to\r\n  the fan shaft or spindle: thus the lubricating oil cannot now run\r\n  down into the fan casing. 4. The chimney is moved forward, and thus\r\n  heats a larger amount of air and reduces fuel. After the necessary\r\n  temperature has once been obtained, one maund of wood will fire one\r\n  maund of Tea. This is an outside estimate.\r\n\r\n  The great feature in Kinmond’s Dryer is the fact that a _separate_\r\n  blast of hot air is forced through the Tea on each tray. In all\r\n  other Dryers I have heard of, the _same_ hot air passes through each\r\n  tray successively, and moisture is consequently more or less carried\r\n  upwards through each. It is principally in this respect, and in the\r\n  large quantity of work it executes, that I consider the excellence of\r\n  Kinmond’s Dryer to consist.\r\n\r\n  It remains only to give shortly the results of a long series of\r\n  experiments with Kinmond’s Dryer. The valuations were made by more\r\n  than one Calcutta broker:--\r\n\r\n         _Class._   _Charcoal dried._  _Machine dried._\r\n\r\n  Pekoe               Rs. 0 11  0        Rs. 0 14  0\r\n  Broken Pekoe        Rs. 0 10  0        Rs. 1  1  6\r\n  Pekoe                £  0  1  6         £  0  1 10\r\n  Broken Pekoe         £  0  1  5         £  0  2  7\r\n\r\n  These were made from the same leaf, at the same time, with every\r\n  care. In one of my gardens, after Kinmond’s Dryer was obtained, the\r\n  Teas averaged upwards of 2 annas per lb. more all round.\r\n\r\n  The Dryer can also be used for withering leaf, but in my opinion no\r\n  Tea Dryer is fit for that work, inasmuch as to do a large quantity\r\n  takes far too much time.\r\n\r\n  Artificial withering is only necessary when the weather is wet and\r\n  cold, and the machine to do it should do a large quantity _at a\r\n  time_. No Tea Dryer _can_ do this. A machine fitted for that work has\r\n  yet to be invented, unless Baker’s Wet Leaf Dryer, of which I have\r\n  heard good accounts, but have not seen, would answer.\r\n\r\n  EDWARD MONEY.\r\n\r\nSince the above was written, further improvements and alterations\r\n(suggested by Mr. Ansell, the Tea engineer, and Mr. Pillans, manager at\r\nPhoolbarry) have been carried out. The machine is now very perfect, and\r\nI consider it the best Dryer at present in the market.\r\n\r\nMr. Kinmond has invented quite lately a coke-burning Dryer. He is now\r\ntaking this with him to India to try it, and has sent me the following\r\nprospectus of it:--\r\n\r\n  The Coke Burning Tea Dryer has been made to meet the want of Tea\r\n  districts where wood fuel is scarce, and coke can be obtained at a\r\n  reasonable price. The upper part of the Coke Burning Tea Dryer is\r\n  exactly the same as the No. 2 Wood Burning Dryer, which is adapted to\r\n  burn any kind of fuel, but its capacity is a little more, being from\r\n  2-1/4 to 2-1/2 maunds pucka Tea per hour. One maund of pucka Tea can\r\n  be dried with the consumption of about 1/4 maund of coke. Besides its\r\n  large capacity for doing work, and its small consumption of coke, the\r\n  Coke Burning Dryer has other advantages. It is nearly one-half less\r\n  in weight than the Wood Burning Dryer, which means one-half saving\r\n  in freight. It requires no foundation or brickwork of any kind; and\r\n  taking into consideration the quantity of work it does, it is the\r\n  cheapest Dryer in the market--costing only £180, f.o.b. in England.\r\n\r\nI know nothing of this Coke Dryer. Its price compares favourably with\r\nhis other Dryers.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1881, the following leader, written by me, appeared in the\r\nCalcutta _Statesman_. Though other Tea matters are included (all\r\nof interest), I give it here as further testimony to the merits of\r\nKinmond’s Dryer:--\r\n\r\n  The days are passed when Tea planters hoped to make a fortune in\r\n  a few years. There are mainly two reasons for this. Firstly, the\r\n  prices of Tea have fallen greatly, in many cases 30 and 40 per cent.\r\n  This is due to the fact that supply, in the case of Indian Tea, has\r\n  overtaken demand. Still, there is some comfort to all interested\r\n  in the industry to be derived from the low prices which have ruled\r\n  during the last two years. So cheap have Indian Teas been that\r\n  the attention of the trade has thereby been directed to them, and\r\n  consequently the deliveries of the last few months have exceeded any\r\n  known previously.[99] It is calculated by those best able to judge,\r\n  that if the present rate of deliveries in London continues, the stock\r\n  in June next will not exceed twelve million pounds, and the truth is,\r\n  strange as it may appear, that below this point it is not well that\r\n  the stock in hand should fall, because, if it does, dealers will not\r\n  be able to meet their requirements, and will then perforce buy more\r\n  China. Low as prices are, we therefore, nevertheless, consider the\r\n  statistical position of Tea to-day as good. There is another point\r\n  which should give comfort and hope to the Indian planter, in spite\r\n  of the fact that we are heavily handicapped in our race with China,\r\n  inasmuch as owing to more expensive labour our cost of production\r\n  _must_ exceed theirs. This source of hope is the great point now\r\n  generally admitted, that Indian Tea is better and goes further than\r\n  China Tea. The experience of each of us can quote instances of\r\n  individuals dropping China Tea, and taking to India; who knows of\r\n  anyone doing the reverse? We admit the taste for Indian Tea is more\r\n  or less an acquired one. Still, the public at home have already been\r\n  educated to the taste by the yearly increasing proportion of Indian\r\n  mixed with China Tea. Speaking generally (though the exceptions\r\n  are many and increase yearly), it is true that Indian Tea is not\r\n  obtainable pure, but no more is China. The bulk of the Tea now sold\r\n  to the public in the United Kingdom is a mixture, three parts China\r\n  and one Indian, and all points to the fact that in a few more years\r\n  the general mixture will be half-and-half.\r\n\r\n  We are thus surely paving the way, in other words, teaching the\r\n  English public to like Indian Tea, and the broad fact that, once\r\n  used, it is never abandoned for its rival is surely a very hopeful\r\n  feature. The truth is that were it possible to _make_ the population\r\n  of England, Australia, and America drink Indian Tea for one week\r\n  only, the demand after that week would be enormous, and we should\r\n  hear no more of “supply exceeding demand;” nay, more, many thousands\r\n  of, acres would at once be added to the present cultivation in India.\r\n\r\n  But we have somewhat wandered from the question we set out with,\r\n  _viz._, _why_ Tea does not pay now as it once did. The first reason\r\n  we have given; the second is that there is now no market for Tea\r\n  seed. This last reason is little dwelt on, but it is a very important\r\n  factor. The days were when Rs. 300 per maund, and even more, were\r\n  paid for Tea seed, and though this did not last long, the price for\r\n  many years up to 1878 was about Rs. 100. Now it is simply unsaleable.\r\n  The receipts for Tea seed, during all these years, formed a large\r\n  part of mature garden earnings, and, to quote one instance, thereto\r\n  in a great measure were due the big dividends paid by the Assam\r\n  Company.\r\n\r\n  But though Tea prices may, and we think will, improve, it is not\r\n  likely we shall ever again see the rates obtainable formerly. This\r\n  being so, it is probable that only those plantations in the future\r\n  will pay that produce Tea cheaply. How is this to be done? Those\r\n  gardens that are heavily weighted by unsuitable climates, by a bad\r\n  class of plant, by slopes which are too steep, by inordinately\r\n  expensive labour, or other causes, will have a hard time of it, but\r\n  plantations with natural advantages need in no way despair. Though,\r\n  as we said above, we cannot, in the matter of cheap labour, vie with\r\n  China, we have a great advantage over the Flowery Land as regards\r\n  economy of production in another respect. We allude to the use of\r\n  machinery, which does much now, and will do more and more as each\r\n  year passes, to reduce the cost of production. Machinery in the\r\n  manufacture of Tea is, we believe, almost unknown in China. There\r\n  each and every operation is performed by hand; here in India many now\r\n  do, and eventually all will, wither, roll, fire, and sort by the\r\n  help of machines. It says not a little for the enterprise and the\r\n  inventive genius of the Anglo-Saxon race that, while in China the\r\n  manufacture of Tea dates back many centuries, and yet all the Tea is\r\n  still made by hand, we in India, who have only planted Tea some forty\r\n  years, have invented machines and use them to-day for each and every\r\n  operation in manufacture. It is but as yesterday that we imported\r\n  Chinamen to teach us the _modus operandi_. We now know far more than\r\n  they do on the subject, and verily the pupil has beaten his master.\r\n\r\n  Though machinery reduces the cost of production, and in more than\r\n  one case improves the quality of Tea, and planters know it, the\r\n  difficulty before them to-day is to know which is the best machine\r\n  for each operation. Unanimity on this point is not to be expected\r\n  yet. One swears by Jackson, another by Kinmond, others by Ansell,\r\n  Barry, Lyle, the inventor of the Sirocco, and so on. The machines\r\n  and names of inventors are many, and each has its disciples. Perhaps\r\n  the most favourite rolling machines are Jackson’s and Kinmond’s, but\r\n  we see the latter has just produced what he calls a “Centrifugal\r\n  Rolling Machine” which he thinks will supersede all others. We have\r\n  not seen it, though it is at work on several gardens, and so can give\r\n  no opinion about it; but another of Kinmond’s machines, his Dryer,\r\n  we know well. It was long a moot point if Tea could be efficiently\r\n  fired by any other agent than charcoal. Many affirmed that the fumes\r\n  of charcoal were necessary; and when, years ago, Colonel Money, so\r\n  well known by his writings in Tea matters, affirmed from experiments\r\n  that charcoal was not necessary, but that any fuel would do the\r\n  work, few believed him, for people said it was impossible to credit\r\n  that the Chinese would have gone on using charcoal (so much more\r\n  expensive than other fuel) for centuries, were it not a necessity.\r\n  What Colonel Money then predicted has already come to pass. Much of\r\n  the Tea now produced in India never sees charcoal at all, and it is\r\n  very certain that in two or three years all Indian Tea will be fired\r\n  by machinery. We say this is certain simply because, apart from the\r\n  saving effected by using other fuel, the value of Teas fired by\r\n  machinery is increased. It is natural it should be so because, by the\r\n  use of the best machines invented for that purpose, the heat can be\r\n  regulated to a nicety, an impossibility by the old mode of charcoal\r\n  firing.\r\n\r\n  Kinmond’s Dryer is, in our opinion, the best Tea Dryer machine\r\n  yet invented. Space forbids our describing it minutely (besides,\r\n  only those, and they are few, who understand Tea machinery would\r\n  appreciate our description), but its general features we will shortly\r\n  touch on. In the comparatively small space it occupies in a factory,\r\n  and in the large quantity of work it does in a given time, we think\r\n  it unrivalled. This last feature does away with the necessity of\r\n  night-work, which, apart from other drawbacks, is prejudicial to the\r\n  excellence of Tea, because, among other reasons, its colour cannot\r\n  then be appreciated in its several stages. Tea made at night is\r\n  never very good. With sufficient motive power, sufficient rolling\r\n  machinery, and Kinmond’s Dryers, the factory (let the leaf gathered\r\n  be what it may) can be shut up at dark. Kinmond’s Dryer may yet\r\n  be improved upon by himself or by others, but as it now stands it\r\n  possesses a feature peculiar to itself, and all important. The hot\r\n  air, driven by a fan (the speed of which, under control, regulates\r\n  the temperature), does not pass successively through the different\r\n  trays, for the hot air, drying the Tea in each tray, has a separate\r\n  inlet and outlet. By this means is avoided the objection of carrying\r\n  the moisture absorbed by the hot air from one tray to the other.\r\n  Another peculiarity in the machine is, that the same air is used\r\n  again and again, being re-dried and re-heated each time. By this two\r\n  advantages are obtained: (1) fuel is saved, it is easier to heat air\r\n  which still retains caloric than fresh air; (2) the aroma of Tea is\r\n  very volatile, and when hot air, which dries it, passes away, some of\r\n  the essence and strength of the Tea goes with it. But here the same\r\n  air being used again and again, the volatile essence (how much who\r\n  can say?) is returned to the Tea. It is reasonable to suppose that\r\n  this will increase the value of the Tea; indeed, we know it did so\r\n  materially in one garden last season.\r\n\r\n  We do not doubt that the unanimity wanting at present amongst\r\n  planters as regards machinery will more or less come with time, but\r\n  only long experience can settle the merits of rival machinery. One\r\n  thing, however, is very certain--if the exports of Indian Tea ever\r\n  vie in quantity with China, it will be due to the use of machinery in\r\n  manufacture.\r\n\r\nI may state that Kinmond and some other inventors of Dryers claim for\r\nthem that in wet weather green leaf may be withered by their means.\r\nBut, as I stated some pages back, I do not think any Dryers suitable\r\nfor withering. _That_ machine has yet to be invented.\r\n\r\nTo conclude my remarks on dryers, I give (again from the _Tea Gazette_)\r\nan estimate of the cost of drying by the old primitive mode with\r\ncharcoal, and with machines. There was no signature to the letter. I\r\ncannot say if the figures assumed are quite correct, but in any case\r\nthe machines have much the best of it:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  TEA DRYING MACHINERY _v._ CHARCOAL.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir,--Tea drying by machinery _versus_ Tea drying by charcoal\r\n  fires over choolahs is, I believe, still discussed as to the relative\r\n  merits of each. I will try and give you a fair estimate of cost, and\r\n  speak from experience as far as I know relative to the merits, ills,\r\n  &c., &c., of both modes of firing.\r\n\r\n  _1st.

All do not divide it\r\nthus, for some make other kinds also. In the body of this Essay (page\r\n122) I say, “I do not believe in any present or future machine for\r\nsifting Tea.” I did not then; that was in the early days of Tea; but I\r\nwas wrong. A sifting machine, on the large scale on which Tea is now\r\nmade, is essential for every garden.\r\n\r\n_Jackson’s Sifter._--I have seen this, and heard it well spoken of, but\r\nI have no experience of it.\r\n\r\n_Greig’s Sifter._--This I have not seen, but from the drawing I have I\r\nshould doubt if it would sift enough per day for a large garden.\r\n\r\n_Pridham’s Sifter._--This is quite a new thing. I know nothing of it.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the manager at Phoolbarry and I have been so thoroughly\r\nsatisfied with the Sifter we use there (Ansell’s) I could conceive\r\nnothing better, and I have not therefore looked into the matter of\r\nSifters.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1881, I sent an article to the _Tea Gazette_ describing\r\n_Ansell’s Sifter_, and as I thought then I think now. I believe it is\r\nby far the best Tea Sifter yet invented. Many are the testimonials,\r\ntoo, in its favour. The price, £80, is too high; but the manufacturers\r\n(Ransomes, Head and Jeffries, of Ipswich) advise me they propose\r\nreducing it to £70. Even that, I think, is too much; but there can be\r\nno question the use of it effects a great saving in a factory.\r\n\r\n  This is my article:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANSELL’S SIFTING, SORTING, AND FANNING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n  _January 27, 1881._\r\n\r\n  In the days gone by, Tea cultivation was, to those commencing a\r\n  Tea career, _the_ thing to study. Those days are passed. None\r\n  are embarking in new gardens, and but few are extending existing\r\n  cultivation. Prices have fallen so wofully that all that Tea planters\r\n  think of to-day is how to make what they have _pay_. _I_ believe in\r\n  Tea still. I think the present low range of prices cannot last, and I\r\n  think so simply because I know Tea will not be cultivated year after\r\n  year at a loss. But the present crisis is very serious: it means,\r\n  in five words, “the survival of the fittest,” and even the fittest\r\n  will not succeed, unless every advantage is taken of all existing Tea\r\n  knowledge.\r\n\r\n  Tea manufacture is now the most important branch in the industry. We\r\n  have advanced greatly in the last few years; but Tea manufacture, as\r\n  regards economy in doing it, is yet comparatively in its infancy.\r\n  Still we have done a great deal since the indigenous plant was\r\n  discovered in the jungles of Assam, now nearly fifty years ago; we\r\n  have advanced more in Tea manufacture than the Chinese, who have\r\n  been making Tea many centuries. That is to say, I affirm that the\r\n  Indian Tea planter of ordinary intelligence knows more of both Tea\r\n  cultivation and Tea manufacture to-day than any of his Chinese\r\n  contemporaries. The Chinaman grows Tea, and makes Tea, as he taught\r\n  _us_ to do it twenty to thirty years ago. The pupil in this case\r\n  has certainly beaten his master. We have made some improvements\r\n  in Tea planting and Tea cultivation, but where we have left our\r\n  teachers far behind is in manufacture. “Johnny” makes his Tea as\r\n  his father made it before him, taught by his grandfather who made\r\n  it the same way; and, for aught we know, no improvements, in that\r\n  way, have taken place in the course of many centuries. All is hand\r\n  labour; machinery to them is unknown. The most primitive ideas in Tea\r\n  manufacture are still adhered to. In support of the latter, I will\r\n  quote one instance: Tea, from time immemorial, has always been dried\r\n  by charcoal in China; no other way is known there now. How is it\r\n  here in India? A large proportion of the produce is fired with other\r\n  fuel, aided by machinery; and it is only a question of time (and a\r\n  very short time) when the whole of it will be thus prepared. I could\r\n  quote other instances: let this suffice, for no comparison can be\r\n  drawn between Tea manufacture as followed out in China and India in\r\n  this year 1881. The former is as crude as it was two or five hundred\r\n  years ago: the latter (though still far from perfection) in its many\r\n  details, in its numerous machines cleverly contrived to save labour\r\n  and better the Teas, is a striking illustration of the activity, the\r\n  energy, the inventive genius of the Anglo-Saxon race!\r\n\r\n  An Indian Tea factory, well set up with machinery--that is to say\r\n  with a green-leaf drying apparatus, rolling machines, Tea dryers,\r\n  equalisers, and sifting and sorting machines, all driven by an\r\n  engine of 15-horse power--offers a wonderful contrast to a Chinese\r\n  Tea factory, where all is handwork. But more strange still is the\r\n  comparison alongside of the fact, that in the former case the\r\n  industry dates back only some thirty years; in the latter many\r\n  centuries.\r\n\r\n  Tea machinery is destined to work great results in India. When\r\n  brought to perfection (it is far on the road now), it will so cheapen\r\n  the cost of manufacture that, though labour is dearer with us than\r\n  in China, we shall, thanks thereto, be able to lay down our Teas at\r\n  cheaper rates than the produce of the Flowery Land. If Indian Tea\r\n  ever vies in quantity with China in the Tea-consuming countries of\r\n  the world, it will be due entirely to the economy effected by our\r\n  machinery. I do not myself anticipate that Indian Teas will ever\r\n  beat China out of the field, but, inasmuch as our Teas are better,\r\n  because the taste for Indian Tea is growing apace, I do believe the\r\n  day will come (it will scarcely be in our time) that the Tea exports\r\n  from India will equal those from China; and, as I said before, to\r\n  machinery, far more than to anything else, will that end be due.\r\n\r\n  There is therefore no question of more importance to the Indian\r\n  planter to-day than Tea machinery. It is a difficult question too,\r\n  because so many machines, for each of the different necessary\r\n  processes, are vieing in competition for public favour. “Which is\r\n  the best machine to buy?” is the question one hears asked daily.\r\n  I propose, with your leave, to write a series of articles on Tea\r\n  machinery, pointing out, as far as in me lies, the advantages and\r\n  defects of those which commend themselves most to me, for I wish to\r\n  give planters, through your paper, the advantage of my experience;\r\n  and as my expressing an opinion in no way precludes others from\r\n  doing the same, and I know your columns are open to all, I would\r\n  invite discussion on rival merits, and thus certainly benefit the Tea\r\n  industry.\r\n\r\n  I will to-day describe what, I think, is the best Tea sifting and\r\n  fanning machine extant. It is true it is the last machine used in\r\n  manufacture, but that does not signify; I will take all the others in\r\n  turn.\r\n\r\n  The said machine is the invention of an able man and engineer, Mr. C.\r\n  W. Ansell, well known in the Darjeeling district for his knowledge of\r\n  Tea machinery. He has been for many years employed as an engineer in\r\n  Tea factories. I heard of his machine when I was lately in England,\r\n  and went down to Ipswich to the manufactory of Messrs. Ransomes,\r\n  Sims, and Head to see it. Though difficult to judge of it, as there\r\n  was no Tea wherewith to test it, I was so pleased with the principle\r\n  that I ordered one. The cost was £80. It has now been working on one\r\n  of my gardens some thirteen months, and in every way it has proved a\r\n  great success. But to describe it, as far as I can, in a few words:--\r\n\r\n  Its length is 19 feet, its breadth 5 feet. The Tea, in bulk, is\r\n  delivered through a hopper from an upper floor, on what I will call\r\n  the A end of the machine, to distinguish it from the other end, which\r\n  I will name B. The principle of all other sifters (except Jackson’s),\r\n  as far as I know, is, that the succeeding trays of differing wire\r\n  mesh are arranged one below the other, the slope all being the\r\n  same way, that is--from A to B. This plan is objectionable in the\r\n  following way: if the Tea has been well rolled and clings together, a\r\n  good deal of the fine Teas that are in the mass or bulk often passes\r\n  some distance down, perhaps over half the tray or wire-mesh length,\r\n  before falling through. If they do so, and the object is to sift out\r\n  any particular class on the next succeeding tray, there is only half\r\n  the length of mesh left to traverse to effect the object, instead of\r\n  the whole length of the tray. This is obviated in practice by pushing\r\n  the Teas continually back up the inclined tray; but this is done at\r\n  the expense of extra labour and making the Teas dusty and grey.\r\n\r\n  The above objection is obviated in Ansell’s machine. It consists\r\n  of four slopes, but each of these incline downwards, alternately,\r\n  different ways--_viz._, No. 1 (the upper), from A to B; No. 2, from\r\n  B to A; No. 3, from A to B; No. 4, from B to A, and below the mesh\r\n  of each slope is a carrying tin tray, sloping the same way, which\r\n  carries all the Tea which falls through each mesh down to _the head_\r\n  of the succeeding slope, while in each case the Tea which will _not_\r\n  pass through the mesh is delivered separately. The above arrangement,\r\n  however, does _not_ hold with the upper or No. 1 slope. This consists\r\n  of two wire trays or meshes, with the carrying tray below the lower\r\n  one. Such of the bulk as will not pass through the upper tray is\r\n  delivered on the head of No. 2 slope, at the B end of the machine.\r\n  What passes through the upper tray, but will not pass through the\r\n  lower, is delivered by a side shoot at the B end of the machine, and\r\n  is “No. 1 Pekoe.” What passes through both sieves on to the carrying\r\n  tray is also delivered by an opposite side shoot from the B end of\r\n  the machine, and is “Broken Pekoe.” Between Nos. 1 and 2 slopes is\r\n  an air chamber, which, as the bulk left on the upper sieve of No. 1\r\n  slope falls on the head of slope No. 2 (a blast being sent through it\r\n  by a fan at the A end of the machine), drives out of the said falling\r\n  bulk all red leaf, stalks, fannings, &c.\r\n\r\n  No. 2 slope receives the bulk at the B end of the machine, after the\r\n  red leaf and fannings are taken out as stated above, and what will\r\n  not pass through the mesh is delivered at the back of the A end of\r\n  the machine, and is “Congou;” while what does fall through the mesh\r\n  into the carrying tray below it (which is still bulk, consisting of\r\n  “Pekoe,” “Pekoe Souchong,” and “Souchong” mixed) is delivered at the\r\n  A end of the machine on to the head of No. 3 slope.\r\n\r\n  What will not pass through the mesh of No. 3 slope is delivered at\r\n  the B end of the machine in front, and is “Souchong;” while what does\r\n  pass through the mesh of No. 3 slope on to the carrying tray below\r\n  (still bulk, consisting of “Pekoe” and “Pekoe Souchong”) is delivered\r\n  on to the head of No. 4 slope at the B end of the machine.\r\n\r\n  No. 4 slope has no carrying tray: it would be useless. What will not\r\n  pass through the mesh is delivered at the A end of the machine, and\r\n  is “Pekoe Souchong;” while what does pass through the mesh falls\r\n  on the floor of the factory and is the remaining “Pekoe,” that is,\r\n  “Pekoe No. 2.”\r\n\r\n  The sorting is so far finished, and the results are the following\r\n  Teas, placed round the machine thus:--“Pekoe No. 1,” at the left\r\n  side of B end; “Broken Pekoe,” at right side of B end; “Red Leaf\r\n  and Fannings,” some distance in front of B end; “Souchong,” also in\r\n  front of B end, but nearer to the machine; “Congou,” at back of A\r\n  end; “Pekoe Souchong,” also at back of A end, but nearer the machine;\r\n  “Pekoe No. 2,” on the floor below the machine.\r\n\r\n  With Teas thus minutely sorted, all possible requirements are\r\n  provided for, and the planter can, by mixing or otherwise, make any\r\n  number of classes he may choose.\r\n\r\n  It will be observed that “Pekoe” is taken out twice, resulting in\r\n  “Nos. 1 and 2 Pekoe.” These differ slightly, but are better mixed\r\n  together. “Why take them out separately,” some exclaim, “to mix them\r\n  together again?” But there are three very good reasons: firstly,\r\n  the “Pekoe” is taken out at the commencement, previous to fanning,\r\n  to prevent the small or broken Pekoe tips being blown out in that\r\n  process; secondly, the “1st Pekoe” being taken out thus early,\r\n  its appearance is not injured by passing over a large amount of\r\n  sieve-mesh area; and thirdly, _all_ the “Pekoe” is thus extracted,\r\n  which it could not be, as far as I can see, by any other process.\r\n\r\n  From all the kinds detailed above, I make only four--viz., “Pekoe,”\r\n  “Broken Pekoe,” “Pekoe Souchong,” and “Broken Tea;” but others can do\r\n  as they will.[101]\r\n\r\n  The machine is of course driven by steam.[102] The movement of all\r\n  the trays is a backward and forward one of 3 inches longitudinal\r\n  semi-circular motion, the latter movement being imparted by the steel\r\n  spring hangers. Only a small amount of power is required to drive the\r\n  machine, viz., under half horse.\r\n\r\n  I must here conclude my description.\r\n\r\n  Now as to the amount of work the machine will do. I speak from actual\r\n  experience when I state what follows:--\r\n\r\n  It will sift and fan seven maunds of Tea per hour. The only hand\r\n  labour required to supplement it is a few (a very few) women to pick\r\n  out any foreign substances out of the “Congou.”\r\n\r\n  At our garden in Western Dooars, 1,260 maunds of Tea were made in\r\n  1880, and all sifted by this machine, the hand labour besides being\r\n  only 44 women during the whole season, or about one-fifth of a woman\r\n  per day.\r\n\r\n  The machine requires only two men to work it continually, and one boy\r\n  to feed it from the upper floor.\r\n\r\n  I can think of no possible objection to this machine, or even of any\r\n  possible improvement. I believe, in the case of a 300-acre garden\r\n  with a decent amount of produce, the machine, in its saving of\r\n  hand labour, pays for itself in one year, whilst the Teas are much\r\n  improved in appearance by its use, and fetch higher prices.\r\n\r\n  EDWARD MONEY.\r\n\r\nI add two more letters in favour of the machine from the same paper:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANSELL’S PATENT TEA SORTING AND WINNOWING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n  Sir,--In respond to your call for information regarding Tea\r\n  machinery, I am happy to supply you with my experience of Ansell’s\r\n  Patent Tea Sorting and Winnowing Machine. I have been sifting the\r\n  whole of my Teas, through it this season, and am therefore in a\r\n  position to state what I think of it. I consider it a most useful\r\n  machine, and a great saver of labour. With four men, I do with it in\r\n  one day an amount of work which without it I would have to employ\r\n  from twenty to twenty-five men to accomplish.--Yours, &c.,\r\n\r\n  “SIFTER.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANSELL’S SIFTING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n  A correspondent writes from London to the _Ceylon Observer_ as\r\n  follows:--Ansell’s Patent Tea Sorter seems to be an article which\r\n  will later be much used in Ceylon. In a memo. before me there is\r\n  an extract from Messrs. George Williamson and Co., who say:--“The\r\n  manager of our Majilighur Garden writes:--‘I have now had sufficient\r\n  experience of Ansell’s Sifter to be able to report very favourably\r\n  upon it. It does its work thoroughly and cleanly, and, owing to the\r\n  comparatively small space it occupies, little or no loss occurs even\r\n  of the finest dust. Sixteen maunds in nine hours is what I find to be\r\n  about its capabilities, and four boys do all the work connected with\r\n  it. It has effected a great saving in the Tea house this year, and\r\n  has quite done away with hand-sieving, except equalizing the broken\r\n  Pekoe and broken Tea--a very trivial operation.’”\r\n\r\n_Packing._--This is the final process. Unless Teas are packed directly\r\nthey are made, they require to be heated once more to drive off any\r\nmoisture imbibed. This can be done in a way in most of the dryers\r\ndescribed, perhaps in Kinmond’s best of all.[103]\r\n\r\nThis concludes my remarks on Tea machinery; but I shall not have a more\r\nappropriate place than this to mention the ornamental tin boxes devised\r\nby Messrs. Harvey Bros. and Tyler, as a new mode of packing Teas. The\r\nfollowing is an article of mine on the subject to the _Tea Gazette_,\r\nwritten in 1880:--\r\n\r\n  I saw lately tin Tea boxes made to hold 20 lbs., which are\r\n  manufactured by Messrs. Harvey Brothers and Tyler, 21, Mincing Lane.\r\n  I was much pleased with them, for I foresaw that by their use great\r\n  good to the Indian Tea industry would accrue. I went to Mincing Lane,\r\n  and had a long talk with the firm, and came away convinced that the\r\n  fact of the said boxes should be known far and wide in India.\r\n\r\n  The boxes measure 15-3/4 by 10 15/16ths by 10 5/16ths. They are\r\n  handsomely illustrated with Indian Tea plantation subjects.[104]\r\n  Each piece runs into a groove in the adjoining one, so that one\r\n  minute will put a box together, and a touch of solder here and there\r\n  completes it; they are then perfectly air-tight. The boxes are very\r\n  sightly. Price is now 2_s._ 5_d._ per box. Boxes sent to Calcutta\r\n  up to this have been charged 2_s._ 7_d._ The price is dependent on\r\n  the fluctuating price of tin, which is somewhat lower now. Of course\r\n  they are sent out in pieces. Cases holding pieces for 100 boxes weigh\r\n  4 cwt. The firm tell me that Messrs. Schœne, Kilburn and Co., and\r\n  Messrs. Begg, Dunlop and Co., in Calcutta, have consignments of the\r\n  boxes, so any of your readers can see them.\r\n\r\n  In my opinion there are several advantages, to be derived from their\r\n  use:--\r\n\r\n  1. They will help to open up new markets. The ungainly, unwieldly\r\n  packages we have used hitherto are certainly detrimental, at least\r\n  where Indian Teas are not known. By the use of these tin boxes the\r\n  sale of our Teas would, I am sure, be extended at home, and they\r\n  would also give great facilities for successfully introducing Indian\r\n  Tea into Australia, Canada, the United States, the Cape, &c. It seems\r\n  some Indian Tea has already been sent home in these tins, and I am\r\n  told it met with a ready sale, quite to 8_d._ per lb. over what it\r\n  would have brought in chests. This is, of course, too good to last,\r\n  but less than one penny a lb. increase would pay for their use.\r\n\r\n  2. The sale of Indian Tea in India would be developed by using them.\r\n\r\n  3. The tares of these boxes is and must be exact, viz., 3 lbs. 15-1/2\r\n  oz., so only a few would be opened at the Custom House,[105] and the\r\n  great loss by the deterioration of Tea being exposed (few know _how_\r\n  great it is) would be avoided.\r\n\r\n  4. There is no doubt Tea will keep better in transit in these boxes\r\n  than in our old packages. How often are the latter broken and the\r\n  lead torn! This evil would be quite avoided.\r\n\r\n  There seems to me to be but one doubtful point. The boxes cannot be\r\n  sent loose on board ship: how then are they to be packed? Chests\r\n  holding four tin boxes were recommended, but they do not smile on me.\r\n  True, they might be made very light: still they would add to the\r\n  size, weight, and cost considerably. I think crates of strong light\r\n  battens would answer perfectly, and six, or perhaps eight boxes might\r\n  then be placed in each. However, this is a matter of detail, which\r\n  experience would quickly decide. To continue the advantages:\r\n\r\n  5. Teas packed in these boxes, and so sold, would not be used for\r\n  bolstering up China rubbish. They would be drunk pure, and thus the\r\n  great desideratum of teaching the public, both here and abroad, to\r\n  use Indian Tea by itself, would be, in a measure, attained.\r\n\r\n  I do not say that any planter should pack _all_ his Teas in this\r\n  new way. The mass of Indian Tea, do what we may, will still be used\r\n  to mix with China. Again, the highest class of Indian Teas are not\r\n  the ones to commence with. As a rule they are too expensive for the\r\n  public to use them alone. Ordinary Teas, or perhaps a mixture which\r\n  could be sold cheaply, and would be a good household Tea, is what I\r\n  should recommend. It is just this kind which is now such a drug in\r\n  the market, and necessarily the diversion of some of this into other\r\n  channels would help us greatly.\r\n\r\n  6. A considerable saving in the loss of Tea at the Custom House would\r\n  result by the use of these boxes, as the following figures will show.\r\n  To begin with, the trade allowance of 1 lb. per package which is now\r\n  allowed the buyer, and which is of course a loss to the producer,\r\n  would be avoided; for this allowance does not apply to any package\r\n  under a gross weight of 28 lbs., and these tins with 20 lb. 2 oz. of\r\n  Tea in them, will weigh gross only 24 lbs. 1-1/2 oz.\r\n\r\n  To make the figures below clear, I must state that the rule of the\r\n  Custom House is to discard fractions of a pound both in the gross\r\n  and the tare. But in the gross the number _below_ is written, in\r\n  the tare the number _above_. Thus, if the gross weight of a package\r\n  is 132-1/2 lbs., the gross is written 132. If the tare of a package\r\n  is 37-1/4 lbs., it is written 38. Now to take one extreme case, to\r\n  show the loss on our ordinary Indian packages: a chest weighs gross,\r\n  say, 132 lbs. 15 oz.; it is still written 132 lbs. The tare of the\r\n  said package weighs, say, 37 lbs. 1 oz.: it is written 38. The tare\r\n  deducted from the gross gives the net weight of Tea. In this case 132\r\n  minus 38 equals 94 lbs., which is all the producer is paid for. But\r\n  the net weight of Tea in the box is 132 lbs. 15 ozs., minus 37 lbs.\r\n  1 oz., equals 95 lbs. 14 ozs., and thus on such a package there is a\r\n  loss of exactly 1 lb. 14 ozs. Add to this the trade allowance of one\r\n  pound, and the whole loss is 2 lbs. 14 ozs., which is about 3 per\r\n  cent.\r\n\r\n  It will be observed that by this custom the advantage, as regards\r\n  the duty of 6_d._ per lb., is on the side of the payee, but none the\r\n  less is it to the loss of the producer. The case quoted above is,\r\n  of course, an extreme one, but in practice I believe the loss of\r\n  Tea on Indian packages, including the trade allowance, is not much\r\n  under 2 lbs. In the case of our ordinary Indian packages, if we could\r\n  regulate our tares exactly, so as to make the gross weight only one\r\n  ounce above the whole number, and the tare one ounce below the whole\r\n  number, the loss would necessarily be much decreased. This, however,\r\n  is impossible, for, as a rule, the tares are one or two pounds less\r\n  when they arrive in England than when they left the garden, owing to\r\n  the wood drying in transit; and thus it is quite a chance what the\r\n  real tares come out here.\r\n\r\n  But, with the tin boxes in question, the tares, that is their weight,\r\n  being fixed and equal, and not liable to change, we can so arrange\r\n  the weights that the loss will be very trifling, thus:--\r\n\r\n                                      lbs.  ozs.\r\n\r\n  The box weighs                        3   15-1/2\r\n  We put in Tea                        20    2\r\n                                       --------\r\n           Gross Weight                24    1-1/2\r\n                                       --------\r\n\r\n  In the Customs the gross is written  24 lbs.\r\n  And the tare is written               4 „\r\n                                       ------\r\n          The Tea paid for will be     20 lbs.\r\n\r\n  that is a loss of only 2 ounces, or not much above half per cent.,\r\n  instead of three per cent., as shown in the old packages.\r\n\r\n  Shortly, to conclude this point. In the case of the old packages by\r\n  no means can we help ourselves; but, as shown, with the tin boxes,\r\n  the loss need be very little.\r\n\r\n  Roughly, the cost of using these tin boxes would be, all told, from\r\n  1-1/2_d._ to 1-3/4_d._ per lb., and with our lead-lined boxes it\r\n  averages perhaps per penny. The difference of a halfpenny, or even\r\n  three farthings, one pound would not be much for the advantages\r\n  detailed.\r\n\r\n  One point I have forgotten. If 500 boxes are ordered, the plantation\r\n  mark is put on the ends of the boxes gratis. If less than 500 are\r\n  ordered, the additional cost for this would be about £5.\r\n\r\n  I hope the Syndicate in Calcutta will try these boxes. I shall\r\n  certainly do so.\r\n\r\n  I enclose the directions for making up the tins, and hope you will\r\n  insert them at the foot of this letter.\r\n\r\n  Reading over the above, there is one point I find not observed on\r\n  as regards the loss of Tea at the Custom House. By the mode of\r\n  weighing, as explained, the producer often loses 2 or 3 per cent.,\r\n  but still, strange to say, in practice, this loss is sometimes more\r\n  than counterbalanced by the increased weight of the Tea due to the\r\n  moisture imbibed while exposed (if boxes are broken in the transit)\r\n  anyhow at the Custom House. But I need not point out that this gain\r\n  is dearly bought by the deterioration of the Tea. The Custom House\r\n  procedure is bad in every way. More on this subject later.\r\n\r\n  EDWARD MONEY.\r\n\r\nThe following is also from the _Tea Gazette_, and is much in favour of\r\nthe boxes:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  PACKING OF TEA IN TIN BOXES.\r\n\r\n  In our issue of November 7th, 1881, we inserted a short editorial\r\n  note questioning, on the authority of certain correspondents, the\r\n  advisability of using tin Tea boxes for the packing of Tea, at the\r\n  same time asking our readers to favour us with their opinions on\r\n  the subject, in case we were misinformed. Our invitation has met\r\n  with a response from several quarters, and the correspondence we\r\n  have received leads us to alter the opinion we formerly held on\r\n  the subject. A gentleman largely interested in Tea, but in no way\r\n  connected with the manufacturers of the patent tin boxes, writes to\r\n  us from England:--\r\n\r\n  “I made enquiries as to the condition in which Tea packed in Messrs.\r\n  Harvey Brothers and Tyler’s lacquered tin boxes is turned out in\r\n  London. I found that the Tea was not at all injured by this method\r\n  of packing, but that its condition is quite as good as that of Tea\r\n  packed in chests. Messrs. W. J. and H. Thompson assured me that you\r\n  were entirely mistaken in your remarks as to the contamination,\r\n  but they thought that an objection to the packing in the lacquered\r\n  tin boxes was the labour of putting up in these boxes. Catalogues\r\n  were shown me in which I saw that the Teas in the lacquered tin\r\n  boxes fetched higher rates than the same Teas packed in chests, the\r\n  difference being in one case 3_d._ per lb.”\r\n\r\n  This is certainly a most favourable testimony, and coming as it does\r\n  from a disinterested party, who writes simply in defence of what he\r\n  considers the right, we cannot but accept of his statement in its\r\n  entirety.\r\n\r\n  Another correspondent writes:--\r\n\r\n  “I now give you a few of the sales of these boxes made at public\r\n  auction during the last month, shewing the preference of the trade\r\n  for Tea so packed, and the higher prices realised.\r\n\r\n                _Public Sale 3rd November._  _s._  _d._\r\n\r\n  Koliabar.    {28 chests Pekoe               1   10-1/2 per lb.\r\n  K.

The narrower the hooping, the more difficult is it to\r\n  manufacture.”\r\n\r\nIt is also not so strong.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[94] “Nil Desperandum” evidently foresees what must be sooner or later.\r\nAll interested in Tea, owners, planters, and inventors, should aid to\r\nachieve the result.\r\n\r\n[95] “Nil Desperandum” takes up three spaces--one bullock in each\r\noutside space and the hoe in the centre. I don’t like the plan. It\r\n_could not_ be done where the tea plants are high.\r\n\r\n[96] In wet weather especially the warm air generated in the factory by\r\nthe fires in it helps the process.\r\n\r\n[97] This, after the previous sentence, is obscure.--E.

None\r\nof the Dryers notified are large enough. A special machine should be\r\ndevised.\r\n\r\n[104] Top is “The Tea Garden;” front, “Weighing Leaf;” back, “Packing;”\r\nends, “Elephant with Howdah,” or, if desired, the plantation mark.\r\n\r\n[105] The following are the numbers to be opened by the Custom House\r\nregulations:--\r\n\r\n  From    1  to   5              1 to be turned out.\r\n   „      6 „    40              3   „    „\r\n   „     41 „    80              4   „    „\r\n   „     81 „   120              5   „    „\r\n   „    121 „   200              6   „    „\r\n   „    201 „   300              8   „    „\r\n   „    301 „   500             10   „    „\r\n   „    501 „   800             12   „    „\r\n   „    801 and upwards         16   „    „\r\n\r\nThis applies to packages of all sizes and kinds, if the tares are equal\r\nor nearly so. If the difference in the tares are not great, an average\r\nis struck. If tares are various all are turned out!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nWEIGHING AND BULKING OF INDIAN TEAS AT CUSTOM HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne misapprehension with some exists on this head. The _weighing_ is\r\ndone by the Customs to ascertain the amount for duty. The _bulking_ is\r\ndone at the request of the vendor, the broker who is to sell it, or the\r\npurchaser, and it has to be paid for.\r\n\r\nTwo distinct injuries are inflicted on the producer by the present\r\nCustom House system--\r\n\r\n  1. The Tea is much damaged by exposure.\r\n  2. The quantity found is _always_ less than the actual.\r\n\r\nNow as to No. 1. When we consider how damp the London atmosphere is\r\nat the best, how in foggy days it teems with moisture, is it not very\r\ncertain that Teas exposed to it, often for days, deteriorate? What\r\ncare we take in India heating before packing--carefully with lead\r\nand solder, excluding all air--and then the Teas on arrival here are\r\ntreated as above! It is simply monstrous.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a letter to _Home and Colonial Mail_ sets\r\nout the case forcibly:--\r\n\r\n  The blame ought not entirely to be laid upon the planter, however,\r\n  for certain facts have come to our knowledge during the present week\r\n  as regards the manner in which Indian Teas are bulked at some of\r\n  the London warehouses, which somewhat explains how depreciation in\r\n  quality comes about. We bought several breaks of Tea in the sales\r\n  this week, which were stated to be bulked and ready for sampling six\r\n  days before the sale; and yet we know for a fact that some of those\r\n  very Teas were not put back into the chest till the day after the\r\n  sale, if even then. More or less moisture is always to be found in\r\n  the London atmosphere, particularly in rainy weather, and there can\r\n  be no question that incalculable injury would be done to a fine Tea\r\n  by seven days’ exposure on the floor of a warehouse. The damage and\r\n  loss falls entirely on the buyer. The effects of it are not seen at\r\n  once, but there can be little doubt that a gradual depreciation sets\r\n  in, consequent on the absorption of moisture. No redrying process\r\n  follows; the Tea is simply filled back into the chests when seven\r\n  days of neglect have done what mischief is possible. Is it to be\r\n  wondered at that samples drawn from such a break of Tea a few months\r\n  after it has been bulked in London will have lost all their freshness\r\n  and malty smell?\r\n\r\n  J. C. TAYLOR AND COLMAN.\r\n\r\nI have no reason to think the delay above is very unusual, and I must\r\nadd to the above, that when the chests are closed no attempt is made\r\neven to cover the top with lead, much less to resolder it. Some paper\r\non top is all attempted. I need say no more to prove that the quality\r\nof Indian Teas is _most_ seriously damaged at the Custom House.\r\n\r\nNow as to No. 2. The loss in quantity to producer.\r\n\r\nThe following article, which I wrote to the _Indian Tea Gazette_ in\r\n1881, shows how invariable the loss must be:--\r\n\r\n  The loss of Tea by the mode adopted at the Custom House in England is\r\n  great.\r\n\r\n  When Teas are sold at Calcutta, though the English Custom House\r\n  regulations do not then affect us immediately, they do so indirectly.\r\n  If purchasers in Calcutta gain by our Teas, they will bid more; if\r\n  they lose, they will bid less. Besides, many Teas are sold in London.\r\n\r\n  To understand what follows, it is necessary to remember that--\r\n\r\n  Garden Invoices _never_ go to Custom House. Custom House arrives at\r\n  weight of Tea by weighing the package for “gross,” and then turning\r\n  out Tea, weighing box, lead, nails, iron hooping, in fact all but\r\n  Tea, for “tare;” gross weight, minus tare, is the weight of Tea they\r\n  demand duty on, and the weight so found by Custom House is all the\r\n  producer or importer gets paid for.[106] It follows, therefore, that\r\n  the less Tea declared by Customs means a loss to producer and a gain\r\n  to buyer. To the latter in two ways, _viz._, less Tea to pay for\r\n  than is really there, and a saving of 6d. per lb. duty! But to show,\r\n  now, how the loss occurs. When weighing for gross, the fractions of\r\n  a pound are discarded; when weighing for tares, the pounds above the\r\n  actual weight are written. The _greatest_ loss that can occur by\r\n  this method, on one package, is 1 pound 14 ounces of Tea. It (this\r\n  greatest loss) _must_ always occur when the gross is 1 ounce short of\r\n  a pound, and the tare 1 ounce more than the pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NO. 1 EXAMPLE.\r\n\r\n  Gross and tare can be put at any figures as to pounds. It will always\r\n  come out the same. Say, therefore,\r\n\r\n                              lbs.   oz.\r\n    Gross                     132    15} actual weights taken at\r\n    Tare (deducted)            37     1}  Custom House.\r\n                              ----------\r\n  Actual Tea in chest          95    14\r\n\r\n  By rule quoted the gross and tare weights are set down at Custom\r\n  House--\r\n\r\n                                lbs.\r\n    Gross                       132\r\n    Tare (deducted)              38\r\n                               -----\r\n  Actual Tea thus paid for  =    94 pounds--on which duty is also paid.\r\n\r\n  Therefore the loss on the chest is 1 pound 14 ounces.\r\n\r\n  The _least_ loss that can take place (when ounces occur in gross and\r\n  tare) is 2 ounces. To insure this the gross must be 1 ounce more than\r\n  the pound, and the tare 1 ounce below.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NO. 2 EXAMPLE.\r\n\r\n  Say any figures in pounds.\r\n\r\n                                lbs.  oz.\r\n    Gross                       133    1}  actual weights taken at\r\n    Tare (deducted)              36   15}   Custom House.\r\n                                --------\r\n  Actual Tea in chest            96    2\r\n                                ========\r\n\r\n  But again, by rule quoted, it is written by Customs--\r\n\r\n                                lbs.\r\n    Gross                       133\r\n    Tare (deducted)              37\r\n                              -----\r\n  Actual Tea paid for            96 pounds, on which duty is also paid.\r\n                              =====\r\n\r\n  Therefore the loss on chest is 2 ounces only.\r\n\r\n  Now did weights turn out the same in London that they were on the\r\n  garden, we could, by doing as in last example, insure only the above\r\n  trifling 2 ounce loss. But it is _not_ so. The wood dries and thus\r\n  makes both the gross and tare less. The loss then comes out anything\r\n  between 2 ounces and 1 pound 14 ounces.\r\n\r\n  I find the following simple rule will give the exact loss on each and\r\n  every weight of both gross and tare.\r\n\r\n  _Rule._--Add the ounces above a pound in the gross to the ounces\r\n  short of a pound in the tare. The sum of the two, in ounces, will be\r\n  the loss of Tea on the package.\r\n\r\nThis is only part of the article. I break off here to add a few remarks\r\nmore appropriate now than what I then wrote.\r\n\r\nThere are means by which this varying loss, of which the maximum is\r\n1 pound 14 ounces, can be reduced to 4 ounces only on each and every\r\nchest.\r\n\r\nI admit the procedure is scarcely practical, but as nothing can\r\ndemonstrate better the absurdity of the system as pursued at the\r\nCustoms, I give it here.\r\n\r\nHow can we insure the _least_ loss, taking into consideration the fact\r\nthat the weights of both the gross and tare, because of the wood drying\r\nand lightening in transit, can never come out the same at the Custom\r\nHouse in London as they were on the garden.\r\n\r\nWe can do it thus: the Tea if well packed in a chest in no way\r\nalters in weight during transit. If dry, when put up, it cannot\r\nbecome lighter; if the leaden covering is air-tight, it can absorb\r\nno moisture, which would of course make it heavier. I therefore beg\r\nthe question that it is a _fixed_ quantity, for it must be so if well\r\npacked.\r\n\r\nWe have therefore only to consider the gross and the tare, and, as\r\nshown, the loss in Tea, varying from 2 ounces to 1 pound 14 ounces,\r\ndepends entirely on the weights these are found to be at the Custom\r\nHouse. In other words, if we can insure the gross there being but\r\nlittle over any even number of pounds, and the tare there being but\r\nlittle below any other even number of pounds, we attain (approximately)\r\nthe least loss we can be mulcted in.\r\n\r\nBegging the question that we can add to, or detract from, the gross\r\nweight of each chest in the Custom House (before it is put into the\r\nscales by the officer there) by the addition or subtraction of a few\r\nnails if the weight is nearly what we want, or pieces of hoop iron if\r\nthe actual varies much from the desired weight--I say, if we can do\r\nthis, we can insure approximately the minimum of loss. I go to show how\r\nthis is to be done.\r\n\r\nPack the Tea in the usual way, but whatever the quantity it is desired\r\nto put into the chest (it can be varied with each class, for it matters\r\nnot what the weight is in pounds) add to it 4 ounces, and be very\r\ncareful that the whole weight of Tea is exactly the number of pounds\r\nrequired, plus 4 ounces--for the whole success of the plan depends on\r\nthis weight being exact. Nothing more is required to be done at the\r\nFactory than has been done hitherto, for it matters not one straw,\r\nas regards the success of the plan, what the gross and tare of each\r\npackage is, nor what the weight of Tea is, as long as exactly 4 ounces\r\nabove an even number of pounds is there; neither does it signify how\r\nmuch the wood lightens in transit, and thus decreases the weights which\r\nwere found at Factory for gross and tare.\r\n\r\nThe next step must be taken at the Custom House in London. Let the\r\nimporter or the producer’s agent attend and weigh each package himself\r\nnicely, any time before the weights are to be taken by the Customs.\r\nThen let him _make_ each package 2 ounces above the even number of\r\npounds. This will be easy enough, by the addition or subtraction of\r\na few nails or hoop iron. For instance, suppose the chest to weigh\r\n140 pounds 6 ounces, he would take away nails or hoop iron weighing\r\n4 ounces. If it weighed 140 pounds 13 ounces, he would, by adding 5\r\nounces more nails or hoop iron, make it 141 pounds 2 ounces. All would\r\nthen be finished, and each and every package so treated would give a\r\nloss in Tea of 4 ounces only.\r\n\r\nIf my plan could be carried out (as the minimum loss otherwise is 2\r\nounces, and the maximum 1 pound 14 ounces the mean is one pound),\r\nwe save a loss of the said pound on _each_ chest, minus the loss we\r\ncompound for, _viz._, 4 ounces. That is to say, we gain 12 ounces on\r\neach package which, in a break of 2 or 3 hundred chests, means a good\r\ndeal to the producer or Customs!\r\n\r\nI will give one example in figures. Any other possible figures can be\r\ntried: it will always come out the same, _if_ the weight of Tea is\r\nexactly 4 ounces above any given number of pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 3.

Say this year (1883), fifty-seven million pounds are imported,\r\nand ninety pounds per chest is taken as the average, this gives over\r\n600,000 chests, and 12 ounces saved on each = 450,000 pounds, of Tea,\r\nwhich at 12 annas per pound, Rs. 3,37,000.\r\n\r\nThe gain to the Customs would be 450,000 sixpences = £11,250.\r\n\r\nThis increase to the Customs would be attained by simply (though still\r\nkeeping under the actual weight of Tea in each chest) taking the\r\ncontents more correctly.\r\n\r\nThe above shows, if figures will show anything, that a great loss to\r\nboth the producer and Customs takes place by the system in vogue. As\r\nthe only object of the Customs _should_ be to arrive at the true weight\r\nof Tea in the most expeditious and simple way, how very absurd is the\r\nsystem pursued! What the _tare_ is can in no way signify to them; all\r\nthey really want is the weight of the Tea. The absurdity of the system\r\nis proved by the fact (demonstrated) that the results to both producer\r\nand Customs _can_ be altered by the addition or subtraction in the\r\nCustom-house of a few nails! How easy to weigh the Tea itself! What\r\npossible objection can exist?\r\n\r\nThe Indian Tea Districts Association having failed to move the Customs,\r\nhave quite lately addressed the following Memorial to the Secretary of\r\nState for India:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF KIMBERLEY, HER MAJESTY’S\r\n  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.\r\n\r\n  The Petition of the Indian Tea Districts Association sheweth--\r\n\r\n  That your Petitioners are a body representing the interests connected\r\n  with the cultivation of Tea in British India, in which enterprise\r\n  British capital to the extent of over fifteen millions sterling has\r\n  been invested.\r\n\r\n  That the industry dates from the year 1838, when the first\r\n  consignment of Indian Tea, consisting of 456 lbs., reached the London\r\n  market.\r\n\r\n  That the imports of Indian Tea for the year ending 30th June,\r\n  1882, were 49,503,000 lbs., having a value of more than £3,300,000\r\n  sterling; while the estimated importation for the current season\r\n  is upwards of 55,000,000 lbs., or fully one-third of the entire\r\n  consumption of the United Kingdom for the year.\r\n\r\n  That the contribution to the Revenue accruing from Customs’ import\r\n  duty on the above quantity of Tea will exceed a million and a quarter\r\n  sterling.\r\n\r\n  That the whole of this large quantity is manufactured and packed on\r\n  between 2,700 and 2,800 separate estates, situated on various parts\r\n  of H.M.’s Indian dominions.\r\n\r\n  That the boxes in which the Teas are packed are in great part made\r\n  of such wood as can be obtained on the several estates, or purchased\r\n  from the neighbouring Forest Department, and it is very important on\r\n  economic grounds, as also in the manifest interests of the districts,\r\n  that this should be exclusively the case.\r\n\r\n  That it has been found, under these conditions, practically\r\n  impossible to meet the imperative Custom-house standard of close\r\n  uniformity of tare weight when the chests reach the Bonded Warehouses\r\n  here.\r\n\r\n  That your Petitioners have reason to complain of the system of\r\n  weighing the Teas in the said warehouses for the purpose of levying\r\n  the duty.\r\n\r\n  That the present system of weighing is to weigh each package in the\r\n  gross, then to turn out the contents, weigh the empty case, and thus\r\n  arrive at the nett weight of the contents.\r\n\r\n  That the only exception to this rule is when the package, _i.e._, the\r\n  empty cases, in a Break closely approximate in weight.\r\n\r\n  That by the said system of weighing, two serious injuries are\r\n  inflicted on the grower and importer of Indian Tea, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  In the first place, a loss of weight is sustained by the fractions\r\n  over the even pound in both gross and tare being given against the\r\n  seller, and in favour of the buyer, amounting, it may be, to 1 lb.\r\n  15 oz., or an average of about 1 lb. in every package weighing over\r\n  28 lbs. gross, in addition to the usual trade allowance of 1 lb. per\r\n  package.\r\n\r\n  Secondly, and by far the more serious grievance, very great injury\r\n  is caused to the Teas by the process of turning them out of the\r\n  packages, in which they arrive hermetically sealed, for the purpose\r\n  of weighing the empty packages. The Teas are thus exposed to the\r\n  atmosphere, the humidity of which they readily absorb, and sustain\r\n  further serious injury and depreciation by breakage from rough\r\n  handling in the process of repacking: the lead linings also are so\r\n  torn in the process as to be rendered comparatively useless for the\r\n  purpose for which they were intended, eliciting loud complaints from\r\n  the trade of the rapid loss of condition of the Teas.\r\n\r\nThat the concession of this Petition, by rendering it unnecessary to\r\nturn out more than a small percentage of the chests to test the correct\r\nweight of contents, would admit of the Teas being bulked in India;\r\nand while it would free the industry from an injurious and vexatious\r\nrestriction, and admit of the Teas reaching the consumer in a purer and\r\nsounder condition, it would also greatly simplify and reduce the work\r\nof the Customs.\r\n\r\nThat the foregoing statistics significantly demonstrate the importance\r\nof the Indian Tea industry to both England and India, and constitute a\r\nclaim to the favourable consideration of both Governments, especially\r\nthat of India, on the ground of the benefit accruing to the districts\r\nin which it is conducted, and the increment of State revenue to which\r\nit has directly and indirectly conduced.\r\n\r\nThat having regard to the existing close and hardening competition\r\nwith China, Japan, and other Tea producing countries, your Petitioners\r\nnaturally feel aggrieved that the important industry they represent\r\nshould be hampered in the contest by the restrictive and superfluous\r\nimpediment forming the subject of their petition.\r\n\r\nThat your Petitioners have unsuccessfully urged on the Commissioners\r\nof Her Majesty’s Customs the adoption of this change of system, and\r\ntherefore venture to address your Lordship.\r\n\r\nThat your Petitioners beg to refer to the accompanying copies of\r\ncorrespondence between the Association and the Commissioners of Her\r\nMajesty’s Customs annexed to this Petition.\r\n\r\nThat the accompanying Memorial signed by the leading mercantile firms\r\nand others in Calcutta, interested in the growth and export of Indian\r\nTea, is an illustration of the feeling in India on the subject of this\r\nPetition.\r\n\r\nYour Petitioners therefore pray--\r\n\r\nThat your Lordship will kindly take such steps as may be necessary to\r\nsecure for your Petitioners the relief sought for.\r\n\r\n  And your Petitioners will ever pray, &c.\r\n\r\n      T. D. FORSYTH,\r\n          Chairman of the Association.\r\n\r\n      ERNEST TYE,\r\n          Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe following reply was received:--\r\n\r\n  INDIA OFFICE, S.W.,\r\n      28th February, 1883.\r\n\r\n  SIR,--I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council\r\n  to acknowledge the receipt of the Memorial addressed to the EARL\r\n  OF KIMBERLEY by the Indian Tea Districts Association, respecting\r\n  the method of weighing Indian Tea at the Custom House. In reply, I\r\n  am to inform you that the Memorial has been forwarded to the Lords\r\n  Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury, with the expression of LORD\r\n  KIMBERLEY’S hope that whatever is practicable may be done to remedy\r\n  the grievance complained of by the memorialists in the interests of\r\n  the Indian Tea trade.\r\n\r\n      I am, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n          (Signed)       J. K. CROSS.\r\n\r\n  The Secretary, Indian Tea Districts Association.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, therefore, that some improvement will now be\r\naccomplished.[107]\r\n\r\nBut at the CRUTCHED FRIARS Warehouse (belonging to the East and West\r\nIndia Docks) a great advance has already been made. The Tea there is\r\nnow bulked, and re-packed by machinery. The Directors most kindly\r\ninvited me to come and witness the process. I went, and was more than\r\npleased with what I saw. The machinery, and all connected with the\r\nprocess, is so well described in an article in the _Home and Colonial\r\nMail_, I cannot do better than give it here:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  TEA BULKING AT THE EAST AND WEST INDIA DOCK COMPANY’S WAREHOUSES, IN\r\n  CRUTCHED FRIARS.\r\n\r\n  It is not a little strange that the importance of effecting\r\n  improvements in the present system of Tea bulking, which has\r\n  exercised the minds of Tea growers and importers so much of late,\r\n  should have hitherto been neglected or ignored by the proprietors of\r\n  the various bonded warehouses in London wherein the Tea is bulked\r\n  and stored. That Tea may be, and only too commonly is, bulked by an\r\n  antiquated and unsatisfactory process is a fact which is well known\r\n  to all who are interested in the matter. How this result is arrived\r\n  at will be seen later on; at present we desire to show that at least\r\n  at one warehouse the question has received the attention which it\r\n  deserves, and to explain, so far as may be possible, the steps which\r\n  have been taken in the matter.\r\n\r\n  It is, then, that old and powerful body, the East and West India Dock\r\n  Company, who have taken up the matter. At the instance of Mr. Du Plat\r\n  Taylor, the able and energetic secretary of the company, supported\r\n  by the equally energetic warehouse superintendent, Mr. Robert Adams,\r\n  the arrangements for bulking Tea at the warehouse of the Company have\r\n  been very greatly improved. More than this; there has been invented\r\n  and set up a special and very ingenious machine for the bulking of\r\n  Tea in a manner which avoids all the failings of the old system. What\r\n  this machine is, and what its peculiar merits are, will best, and\r\n  perhaps only, be clearly understood by a brief description of the\r\n  two systems as we lately saw them in operation at the warehouses of\r\n  the company in Crutched Friars, which we may mention are nearer than\r\n  any others to Mincing-lane, an advantage securing to planters and\r\n  importers the certainty that their Teas will be sampled by the trade\r\n  generally.\r\n\r\n  Under the old system, then, each chest of a break, after having been\r\n  subjected to certain preliminary formalities, is opened, and the\r\n  Tea turned out in a heap on the floor of the warehouse. When this\r\n  is done the Tea is bulked by means of wooden spades, each spadeful\r\n  being thrown to the top of the central heap, so that it falls over\r\n  and on all sides. Here the Tea lies until it is placed back again in\r\n  the chests after they are tared, there being a considerable interval\r\n  at some of the London warehouses between the bulking and refilling.\r\n  The refilling is thus accomplished. The Tea is first put into bags\r\n  and weighed on a machine at the side of the bulk. The bag and chest\r\n  are then taken off the weighing machine and the contents of the bag\r\n  are emptied into the chest. The Tea, however, requires some pressure\r\n  to force it into the chest, and this pressure is obtained by an\r\n  expedient of a very primitive kind. When the chest is partly filled\r\n  a man gets in and presses down the Tea by treading on it. So soon as\r\n  the Tea is all in the chest the package is properly secured, and the\r\n  operation is completed.\r\n\r\n  Now the serious faults of this plan are at once apparent. In the\r\n  first place the Tea, being in heaps on the floor of the warehouse\r\n  with a large surface exposed to the atmosphere, runs the risk of\r\n  losing a great deal of its freshness and aroma, this risk being\r\n  largely increased by the doors of the warehouse being kept open in\r\n  order to discharge or to receive merchandise in all weathers. No\r\n  atmospheric influences are calculated to benefit Tea. Then, again,\r\n  the shovelling of the Tea by means of wooden spades, and the treading\r\n  into the chests, can hardly do otherwise than injure the Tea--the\r\n  filling in a minor degree and the treading to a more serious extent,\r\n  the result being, of course, that the Tea is depreciated.\r\n\r\n  The East and West India Dock Company have made the best of this\r\n  primitive method of Tea bulking. In the first place it is insisted\r\n  on in their warehouses that previous to trampling the Tea into the\r\n  chests, a cloth shall be placed over it to preserve it from the dirt\r\n  of the man’s boots, and to some extent from injury--a precaution\r\n  which, strange as it may seem, is not taken in every bonded\r\n  warehouse. Then, again, Mr. Adams, the warehouse superintendent--who\r\n  could hardly have the interests of planters and importers more at\r\n  heart were he “in Tea” himself--uses his best endeavours to refill\r\n  the boxes with as little delay as possible, and thus to prevent it\r\n  from being injured by undue exposure to the atmosphere. He also keeps\r\n  the floors of the warehouse as clean as practicable. But feeling\r\n  that the best efforts, however well devised, and however strenuously\r\n  carried out, must necessarily be attended with but partial success,\r\n  the East and West India Dock Company have erected--as has already\r\n  been mentioned--a Tea bulking machine, a device which is ingenious\r\n  and meritorious, and which seems to be, so far as it has been tried,\r\n  a great success.\r\n\r\n  This machine, designed by Mr. Tydeman, of the company’s engineering\r\n  staff, and constructed under his supervision, consists, firstly, of\r\n  a large hollow revolving drum weighing nearly two and a-half tons,\r\n  and of sufficient capacity to thoroughly bulk about 50 chests of Tea.\r\n  The drum is made to hold about 100 chests of Tea, which leaves ample\r\n  space for the bulking of the above quantity. Inside this drum are\r\n  frames fitted at intervals with iron rods, and extending at varying\r\n  angles from the axle of the drum to its extremity. Externally the\r\n  drum has two openings for the reception of the Tea, and two smaller\r\n  ones for its discharge. In a line with the axle of the drum, some\r\n  height from the floor, is a platform to which the chests are conveyed\r\n  by a double lift which simultaneously ascends with a full chest and\r\n  brings down an empty one. Adjuncts to the machine are a weighing\r\n  machine, a presser, and four beaters--of the two latter the nature\r\n  and object will be immediately apparent. The process of bulking\r\n  as effected by this machine is briefly as follows: The drum being\r\n  revolved till its receiving openings are level with the platform,\r\n  a chest of Tea is raised, as before explained, and the contents\r\n  examined on the door of the drum, which falls back into a horizontal\r\n  position for that purpose, then by closing the tray or door the Tea\r\n  is passed into the drum. The lift then brings up another full chest\r\n  and takes down the emptied one, which is at once taken to a scale for\r\n  taring purposes, and so the process is continued till the break is\r\n  exhausted. This filling process can be carried on at both sides of a\r\n  drum at once, as there are two openings and two lifts. The Tea being\r\n  in, the drum is made to revolve, when the iron frames thoroughly mix\r\n  the Tea in a very few revolutions--three would suffice.\r\n\r\n  The drum has now to be emptied, and this operation is effected in\r\n  the following manner:--The revolution of the drum is stopped when\r\n  the openings through which the Tea is released are brought over the\r\n  weighing machines--there are two for greater expedition--on which are\r\n  placed the chests ready to receive it. The delivery doors (worked\r\n  by levers) being opened, the Tea is allowed to descend till the\r\n  chest is about half full, when the presser and beaters are brought\r\n  into play by hydraulic pressure. The presser is a piece of flat\r\n  iron about an inch in thickness, removable at pleasure, and varies\r\n  in size to fit either a chest or a box. The beaters are four pieces\r\n  of the same metal, which support the chest so soon as it is on the\r\n  weighing machine. When the chest is partly filled, the beaters are\r\n  released, and, by the action of a wheel, are made to strike all four\r\n  sides of the chest, and thus shake the Tea down. The presser is\r\n  also brought down to press the Tea in. The action of both of these\r\n  agents can be regulated to any required degree of force. Thus by\r\n  degrees the chest is filled, and (the supporting beaters having been\r\n  released and the presser raised) is weighed and ultimately removed.\r\n  Such, in brief, is the action of the new Tea bulking machine. One\r\n  or two points, however, remain to be mentioned. The power by which\r\n  the machine is actuated is hydraulic. The presser will not injure\r\n  the Tea. The beaters serve the triple purpose of holding the chest\r\n  in position on the weighing machine, of supporting it should it be\r\n  of weak construction, and of materially assisting the repacking of\r\n  the Tea. The beating action does not in any way injure the chests.\r\n  Our readers will also be pleased to know that certain very marked\r\n  improvements even upon the above described are already in hand by\r\n  this Dock Company--improvements which will greatly increase the value\r\n  and usefulness of their machinery for bulking Teas.\r\n\r\n  To descant on the advantages over the old system of bulking which are\r\n  possessed by the machine which has been described would be little\r\n  better than a waste of time. Yet some few points may be briefly\r\n  referred to. First, cleanliness is secured, for from first to last\r\n  the Tea is never touched by hand or foot. Again, the Tea cannot be\r\n  injured, nor can it lose its aroma, for it is never exposed to the\r\n  atmosphere at all. Instead of being allowed to lie on the floor\r\n  of the warehouse for any period, the entire process of bulking is\r\n  completed without break or delay. The Directors of the East and West\r\n  India Dock Company are not, of course, so sanguine as to imagine that\r\n  the old system of bulking will be at once abandoned; indeed, they\r\n  have, as has been mentioned, taken steps to improve that system;\r\n  they do, however, think that it should be abandoned, and to that end\r\n  have adopted the Tea Bulking Machinery as an alternative, and an\r\n  immeasurably superior process. That they are justified in this view\r\n  there can be no doubt in the minds of those who have witnessed both\r\n  the systems in operation.\r\n\r\nThe said machinery is at the CRUTCHED FRIARS Warehouse alone, and it\r\nis, of course, very desirable the machinery should be adopted in all\r\nTea warehouses. This end will be quickly brought about if those who\r\nsend their Tea home, and the importers here, insist on their Tea being\r\nsent to this one warehouse that has the machinery.\r\n\r\nWhat an advantage to owners and managers of Tea estates is the fact\r\nthat Tea bulked by machinery at CRUTCHED FRIARS is not exposed to the\r\nchangeable English atmosphere, or at least not for more than a few\r\nminutes, and consequently is not so likely to be classed as “flat.”\r\nHow many planters are there who, after taking especial care in the\r\nmanufacture of their crop, find to their chagrin that on arrival in\r\nLondon (and after exposure probably for some days), the shipment is\r\ndescribed as “flat,” and worth so many pence per lb. less than if the\r\natmospheric exposure had not occurred.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that very little, added to the help this new machinery\r\ngives, would now do away with _all_ the injury the producer and the Tea\r\nhas hitherto borne in the Customs. So much has now been accomplished\r\nby this machinery, the Tea is well bulked, and _receives no injury\r\nwhatever thereby_. But two further improvements are required:--\r\n\r\n  1. That the actual weight of Tea in each chest (discarding ounces)\r\n  be recorded, and that thus the loss to the producer and the Customs,\r\n  detailed above, be avoided.\r\n\r\n  2. That the lead at top of the Tea be carefully replaced and\r\n  resoldered, so that every chest shall leave the Custom House in as\r\n  good condition as it entered it.\r\n\r\nVery little addition to the machinery detailed above would accomplish\r\nthe first. The chest ready to receive the Tea, plus the lid and top\r\nlead (which should have been carefully removed), might be weighed on\r\nthe platform at the side of the big drum (by simply making the said\r\nplatform a weighing machine) and weighed again when filled, with the\r\nlid and lead laid on it. The difference of the two weights would, of\r\ncourse, be the weight of the Tea.\r\n\r\nThe second is a question of expense; it would not be great if done\r\nsystematically. The chest should be carefully opened, and the top lead\r\nremoved in a square piece _nearly the size of the box_. When replaced,\r\na narrow strip of lead, soldered down on either side, would make the\r\ncovering complete.\r\n\r\nJustice will not be done to Indian Teas till this last is accomplished.\r\n\r\nWho should bear the expense? The chests are received into the Customs\r\nfor the benefit of the Revenue, and who can doubt, were the question\r\ntried in a Court of Law, that they are bound to return them in as good\r\ncondition as they were received. They do _not_, and have never done\r\nso, and I only wonder the trade has stood it so long, and has not sued\r\nthem. Were the course I advise followed out, there would remain no\r\ncause of complaint, and the trifling cost of soldering on the lid again\r\nshould doubtless, therefore, be borne by the Customs.\r\n\r\nBut in reality the Customs would sustain no loss--in fact, the other\r\nway. I have shown clearly at page 278 _that were the weight of Tea\r\ncorrectly recorded, the Customs would receive in duty upwards of\r\n£11,000 each year from Indian Tea more than it does now_. To re-solder\r\nthe lids on the boxes would cost nothing like that; and highly as\r\nIndian Tea is thought of now, how much higher still would it stand were\r\nit not injured to the frightful extent it is in passing through the\r\nCustoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nI lit on the following in the _Home and Colonial Mail_ just before\r\ngoing to press, and it is too pertinent to much in preceding pages to\r\nomit:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE CHINA TEA TRADE.\r\n\r\n  The influence of the expansion of the Indian Tea enterprise on the\r\n  trade in China is being felt. We have more than once adverted to the\r\n  fact that the growing use of the well-flavoured Teas of India would\r\n  diminish the consumption of the better grades of China Tea, and that\r\n  the effect of the competition between the two countries would be\r\n  first seen in the falling off in the demand for so-called fine China\r\n  Tea.\r\n\r\n  The following letter, which appeared in the _Times_ Money article\r\n  lately, confirms this view, and refers to the present unsound\r\n  condition of the China Tea trade:--\r\n\r\n  “Sir,--In view of the opening of the Tea season in China, a few\r\n  remarks upon the present position and future prospects of this\r\n  important trade may not be inopportune.\r\n\r\n  “It is no secret that for some years past the losses of merchants\r\n  have been serious, and that while most of the wealthy firms so long\r\n  known as connected with China have either entirely ceased to import\r\n  Tea, or have reduced their operations to a very small compass,\r\n  the trade has been carried on by new houses possessing but little\r\n  capital, who are enabled, by the competition of the banks, to do a\r\n  large business by drawing bills on China, not only for the whole\r\n  cost of the Teas purchased, but also for their commissions on these\r\n  purchases--that is to say, for an unrivalled profit of 3 per cent.\r\n  The question, Who has so far paid the losses of the past two years?\r\n  is one that greatly exercises the minds of the trade. Many suppose\r\n  that large balances are being carried over in the books of some of\r\n  the banks, or by the Chinese, and that it is the hope of recouping\r\n  a portion of this loss that induces the banks or the Chinamen to\r\n  support those who would otherwise be obliged to relinquish the\r\n  trade. The Chinese have also a further inducement to support such\r\n  firms, since it is partly through them that those high prices are\r\n  established in China at the opening of the season which entail so\r\n  much loss afterwards. As a result of these prices, about 30 per cent.\r\n  more fine Congou is produced than (on account of the competition of\r\n  the Indian growth) can be consumed except at the price of medium Tea.\r\n  How large the excess is may be gathered from the fact that, although\r\n  5,000,000 lbs. of this class of Tea was lost last July in the\r\n  ‘Moskwa’ and the ‘Fleurs Castle,’ yet stocks in Russia have increased\r\n  by about 30,000 half-chests, and there is still so large a quantity\r\n  on this market that it can only be realized at a loss of from 5_d._\r\n  to 6_d._ per lb. on the China cost; thus some Teas, said to have cost\r\n  in Hankow 1_s._ 8_d._ to 1_s._ 9_d._, have been recently sold as low\r\n  as 1_s._ 3_d._, and others costing 1_s._ 7_d._ in Foochow, have been\r\n  sold at 1_s._ 1_d._ per lb.\r\n\r\n  “It is evident from the above that merchants as a rule do not realize\r\n  the immense change that has been brought about in the conditions\r\n  of the trade by the enormous increase in the use of Indian Tea,\r\n  which now forms about one-third of the entire home consumption, and\r\n  competes mostly with the finer qualities of China congou; nor the\r\n  fact that all engaged in the trade are becoming year by year more\r\n  averse to holding stock on account of the heavy charges involved,\r\n  and the risk of deterioration in quality. Yet, as the whole twelve\r\n  months’ supply of first crop Tea arrives within three months of\r\n  the opening of the season, it is plain that some one must hold the\r\n  balance, which can only be done with safety if the Tea be bought at\r\n  a very low price.\r\n\r\n  “The one remedy for the present condition of things is that the great\r\n  bulk of the so-called fine Teas should be bought in China at their\r\n  present value on this market--viz., at about 5_d._ to 6_d._ below the\r\n  prices given for them in recent years. With the large accumulated\r\n  stocks in Russia, and consequently reduced orders from that country,\r\n  the yearly-increasing supply of Indian Tea, and the present prices\r\n  here, one would think that such a course would at once be adopted.\r\n  Unfortunately, however, so much of the Tea is bought on commission,\r\n  and the Russian agents seem so reckless as to the prices which they\r\n  give, that any such prudent action can hardly be hoped for. It would,\r\n  therefore, be wise for holders of shares in Eastern banks, as well\r\n  as all who have been in the habit of intrusting orders to buying\r\n  agents in China, to ponder the foregoing facts, which can be easily\r\n  verified by a reference to any of the trade circulars lest their\r\n  money should be lost in the crash which must certainly take place if\r\n  the past policy of Tea buyers in China be continued.--I am, &c.,\r\n\r\n  “A. B.”\r\n\r\nWill those warned be wise in time, and not swamp the Home Market with\r\nChina Teas certain to be sold at a loss? Who can say? But “A. B.” is\r\nevidently master of the subject, and if his advice in not taken, the\r\nChina Tea “crash” he predicts will not be a small one.\r\n\r\nWhen China Teas are _not_ sent home to realise a certain loss, our\r\nIndian Teas will have fairer play.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude without acknowledging the great help I have derived\r\nfrom the pages of the _Tea Gazette_ in writing these additions to my\r\nFourth Edition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince my remarks on Ceylon were printed, I have acquired much further\r\ninformation regarding the Tea industry in that island, and the\r\nprospects certainly seem very favourable. Anyhow, there seems to be no\r\ndoubt that Ceylon for Tea offers quite as good a field as any part of\r\nIndia, always supposing that good sites are selected and the area to\r\nchoose from is large.\r\n\r\nThe future market for Tea is really, as regards Ceylon, the only\r\ndoubtful point, and consequently (as at page 183) I advise the planters\r\nthere to act with caution.\r\n\r\nWhere it is proposed to put coffee lands under Tea, of course one\r\ngreat advantage in economy will be gained, inasmuch as there will be\r\nno jungle clearing or previous cultivation. But here again caution is\r\nnecessary. Make sure the soil is not worn out, for Tea, though it will\r\ngrow, will not yield largely on such.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _June, 1883._\r\n\r\nP.S.--The following are the new rules lately issued by the Customs\r\nregarding the future treatment of Indian Teas.\r\n\r\n  The weight of Indian Tea for duty may, if desired by the importers,\r\n  be ascertained under the following regulations:--\r\n\r\n  1. The Tea on arrival to be weighed to ascertain the gross weight of\r\n  each package.\r\n\r\n  2. With each entry the importer to give an endorsement of the net\r\n  contents of each package.\r\n\r\n  3. To test the accuracy of this endorsement, 10 per cent. of each\r\n  break to be turned out and weighed net.\r\n\r\n  4. If the difference between the weight given of any package and the\r\n  weight found exceeds or is less than 3 lbs., the whole parcel should\r\n  be weighed net.\r\n\r\n  5. Duty to be charged on the average weight of the packages weighed\r\n  net, unless the importer elects to weigh the whole parcel in the\r\n  usual way.\r\n\r\n  6. When the average of the packages weighed net amounts to so many\r\n  pounds and a-half, an additional pound will be charged on each of the\r\n  whole parcel; when the fraction is less than half a pound it is to be\r\n  rejected.\r\n\r\n  7. The new system to come into operation on July the 1st next.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[106] If tares are nearly equal, and if Teas are well bulked in India,\r\nonly some packages (about 10 per cent.) are opened, and an average tare\r\nstruck. But this in no way saves the loss in _quantity_ of Tea, though,\r\nof course, less Tea is thus _injured_.\r\n\r\n[107] Since I wrote the above the Customs have framed new rules for\r\nIndian Teas. The absurd tare system is done away with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA\r\n\r\n_TO THE THIRD EDITION_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following from the _Indian Economist_, regarding Indian Teas in\r\ngeneral and Neilgherry Teas in particular, is not out of place here. At\r\nthe same time I do not agree with the writer, for I believe that in the\r\nstrength and pungency of Indian Teas consists their value:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  INDIAN TEA.\r\n\r\n  “That the Teas of India have at length come to be fully appreciated\r\n  in England may be taken, we presume, as an admitted fact; and it\r\n  is of importance that planters should direct their attention to\r\n  modifying their methods of manufacture so as to suit the public\r\n  taste, and, if possible, turn out an article free from the objections\r\n  still advanced against the Indian leaf as a daily beverage. There\r\n  are, we know, those who argue that enough has been done, and that\r\n  consumers will acquire a taste for the produce of our gardens in\r\n  time; but we have daily evidence that in the most trivial matters\r\n  there is no greater tyrant than the public. It behoves those then who\r\n  cater for this tyrant to consult its taste and satisfy its demands,\r\n  however exacting and capricious they may be. The remarks we are about\r\n  to make are based on experiments and enquiries extending over some\r\n  years in this country and in England, and we leave those engaged in\r\n  the enterprise to estimate their value. All Teas grown in the plains\r\n  of India are known to the trade in London under the general name of\r\n  Assam, and are chiefly used for mixing, seldom reaching the consumer\r\n  in a pure state. When they do, the objections raised are that the\r\n  leaf is too pungent and rough for most palates; and purchasers are\r\n  in the habit of mixing it with Chinese to tone down those astringent\r\n  qualities. In other words, it wants the delicacy of flavour which\r\n  is the chief characteristic of the Chinese leaf, meaning of course\r\n  that vended by respectable houses, not the abominable trash that\r\n  formed part of the cargoes of the _Lalla Rookh_ and _Sarpedon_,\r\n  containing, according to Dr Letheby’s Analysis, ‘40 to 45 per\r\n  cent. of iron filings and 19 per cent. of silica.’ Nor is this lack\r\n  of delicacy of flavour to be lightly regarded, for the efforts of\r\n  our manufacturers have been directed unwittingly and indirectly\r\n  to foster the peculiarity, as the test of Indian Tea has hitherto\r\n  been its strength and pungency, to fit it for _salting_ weak, thin,\r\n  inferior sorts of Chinese. This is what the dealers have demanded,\r\n  and what, consequently, brokers in their turn have insisted on, with\r\n  the result that the out-turn of our Assam and Cachar plantations is\r\n  now, if anything, too powerful to suit public taste. Whether means\r\n  of manipulation may be hit upon by which aroma can be retained\r\n  without sacrificing strength, we leave those most interested to\r\n  determine; but it is worthy of note that this objection to strength\r\n  and roughness is almost confined to women, the sterner sex preferring\r\n  Assam unmixed, while the working classes of both sexes are unanimous\r\n  in favour of the unadulterated Indian article. Experiments were\r\n  further tried by substituting Neilgherry Tea, and after a short\r\n  interval the verdict of the majority was in its favour. We need\r\n  now only point out the difference in the manufacture between the\r\n  two Teas, leaving others to decide questions regarding the bearing\r\n  of climate or altitude. Up to the time of finishing rolling, the\r\n  manipulation of the leaf is identical, care being taken to retain the\r\n  juice; but that made on the hills instead of being almost immediately\r\n  placed over _choolas_ was spread out thinly on tables all night, in\r\n  a temperature of 54 deg., sustaining consequent loss of strength by\r\n  evaporation, but developing an aroma that established it at once in\r\n  favour. So successful has this Neilgherry Tea been at home, that\r\n  offers are now received by plantation proprietors for their produce\r\n  at half-a-crown per lb. free on board, in Madras. This would seem to\r\n  indicate that the aroma is generated by the action of cold upon the\r\n  damp leaf while in a state of ‘suspended fermentation;’ for, previous\r\n  to experimenting with consumers, the samples were submitted to\r\n  Mincing Lane brokers and pronounced sound, in corroboration of which\r\n  opinion the bulk from which they were taken sold at auction for 2_s._\r\n  2-1/2_d._, so that fermentation (_i.e._ sourness) had been carefully\r\n  avoided. We know that the climate of Assam and temperature of the\r\n  Tea-houses render the keeping of rolled leaf even for an hour fatal\r\n  to soundness; but should the development of this aroma be really due\r\n  to ‘suspension of fermentation’ is it not worth while adopting some\r\n  contrivance for cooling down a chamber set aside for the purpose of\r\n  spreading out the rolled leaf to the temperature required?\r\n\r\n  “The question whether delicacy is due to altitude alone and not\r\n  to manufacture might be ascertained by experiment. Let a quantity\r\n  of green leaf be sent _down_ from one of the Neilgherry gardens,\r\n  and worked up in the plains at the foot of the hills, and an equal\r\n  quantity sent _up_ from one of the Assam gardens, say to Shillong,\r\n  and manufactured on the Neilgherry principles there, and the result\r\n  then compared. This experiment would cost little and determine a not\r\n  unimportant question: for all engaged in Tea are interested in using\r\n  their best endeavours to fit it for public consumption, and to guard\r\n  it against Chinese in any shape or form whatever.”\r\n\r\n  _Note by the Author._--That “delicacy of flavour,” and “want\r\n  of strength” with it, _is_ due to altitude has long ago been\r\n  admitted, and any experiments on that head would, I think, be quite\r\n  unnecessary. The experiments as to manufacture on the Neilgherries\r\n  are interesting, and should be further looked into.\r\n\r\n  E. M.\r\n\r\n  I have at last completed experiments with a view to do away with the\r\n  use of charcoal in Tea manufacture, and I think with success.\r\n\r\n  The “Furnace Teas,” for so I purpose naming them, have in most cases\r\n  been pronounced by the Calcutta brokers to be superior to similar\r\n  samples of the same day’s leaf, made in the usual way over charcoal.\r\n\r\n  Nothing but the heat generated by _any_ fuel placed in furnaces sunk\r\n  under ground outside the Tea-house is used. No motive power of any\r\n  kind is employed. The apparatus is very simple. It is cheap to erect\r\n  and very durable in character.\r\n\r\n  As the apparatus with which the Teas up to the present time have been\r\n  made is a rude and imperfect one, having disadvantages which must\r\n  tell more or less on the excellence of the Teas so manufactured, and\r\n  as, even with these disadvantages, the Teas are pronounced by the\r\n  brokers _at least_ equal to charcoal-dried Teas, it is not too much\r\n  to hope that with a perfect apparatus (one of which will be erected\r\n  immediately) Teas will be improved in value by this new invention.\r\n  The following will be shortly the advantages of this new process,\r\n  even supposing the Teas are no better:--\r\n\r\n  1. _Economy._--This will possibly be even greater than what is set\r\n  out in the extract of the local paper below; for the fact that the\r\n  Tea is never placed over charcoal until the whole is ignited, and has\r\n  become “live charcoal,” is not there recognized, much of the caloric\r\n  thus escapes.\r\n\r\n  2. Cleanliness and absence of charcoal dust.\r\n\r\n  3. Absence of the objectionable fumes of charcoal.\r\n\r\n  4. Immunity from fire in Tea-houses.\r\n\r\n  5. Greater speed in the firing process, and the saving of all the\r\n  labour employed to make charcoal.\r\n\r\n  6. Reduced temperature in Tea-houses.\r\n\r\n  If all the advantages are, as I expect they will be, attained, the\r\n  life of a Tea planter will be more pleasant than hitherto.\r\n\r\n  The following is the opinion of the new process expressed by the\r\n  _Darjeeling News_ of 1st August:--\r\n\r\n  “It has long been a question, which all planters were desirous to\r\n  solve, if the fumes of charcoal were necessary to make Tea, that is\r\n  to say, if any chemical action was produced on the Tea by the said\r\n  fumes, and if not, whether it would not be possible to do the firing\r\n  in some other and far cheaper way.\r\n\r\n  “The question has, we believe, been solved by Colonel Edward Money,\r\n  and if so, for the invention is quite a new one, a boon of great\r\n  magnitude will have been conferred on the Tea interest of India. We\r\n  congratulate this district as being the birthplace of the improvement.\r\n\r\n  “The apparatus at present in use at Soom, and which we have seen\r\n  working, is a rough and crude one made on the spot. This, and the\r\n  more perfect plans from which larger and better ones are to be made,\r\n  are readily shown by Colonel Money to anyone visiting Soom; but until\r\n  the invention is patented, it is not well to describe it in print.\r\n  Suffice if we say the invention is a remarkably simple one--cheap to\r\n  erect--durable in its character, and the working thereof unattended\r\n  with any expense whatever, beyond the cost of the fuel (which may\r\n  be of any kind), and which of course will be many times less than\r\n  charcoal.\r\n\r\n  “If true, as we hear, that it takes 3-1/2 maunds of wood generally\r\n  to make one maund of charcoal, and if also true, as Colonel Money\r\n  suggests, that the caloric in one maund of wood equals the caloric\r\n  in two maunds of charcoal, it then follows that each maund of wood,\r\n  put into Colonel Money’s furnace, equals seven maunds of wood to make\r\n  charcoal.\r\n\r\n  “Of course the above are more or less random figures, but they\r\n  suffice to show that the saving of fuel will be very great--a boon\r\n  of course to planters, but a boon also to the Forest Department and\r\n  to India.\r\n\r\n  “We knew of the invention some time back, but we forbore to notice\r\n  it until the brokers’ reports on the Tea so made had been received.\r\n  We have now seen these. Samples of ‘charcoal’ and ‘furnace’ Tea were\r\n  sent down, made from the same leaf, the same day, and manufactured\r\n  in one up to the “firing” process. Two brokers give the higher value\r\n  to the furnace Tea, one to the charcoal kind--but the difference is\r\n  small.\r\n\r\n  “We believe, as one of our most experienced planters, who has tasted\r\n  the Teas, been to Soom, and seen the brokers’ reports, says, that\r\n  ‘the Tea dried by the furnace apparatus will be _at least_ equal to\r\n  that prepared over charcoal.’\r\n\r\n  “As Colonel Money is already known as an authority in Tea, and as\r\n  he has stated to us his belief that ‘charcoal days’ for Tea are\r\n  now at an end, we await with confidence the ultimate success of\r\n  his invention, which even if it makes no better Tea will certainly\r\n  make it far cheaper, while the dirt from charcoal dust will be done\r\n  away with, the temperature of the Tea-houses much reduced, and the\r\n  deleterious fumes of charcoal, so very objectionable from a sanitary\r\n  point of view in Tea manufacture, will be known no more.”\r\n\r\n  Again, 29th August, a month later, the _Darjeeling News_ further\r\n  remarks:--\r\n\r\n  “We alluded recently to Colonel Money’s very ingenious plan for\r\n  drying Tea without charcoal. Since then his apparatus has been\r\n  in full work at Soom, and has been inspected by numbers of the\r\n  Darjeeling planters, one and all of whom have, we understand,\r\n  reported most favourably on its working. Samples of Tea manufacture\r\n  have been from time to time sent to Calcutta brokers for their\r\n  opinion, and reports have been received from fifteen, of whom seven\r\n  are in favour of Tea made by the old charcoal process, seven are in\r\n  favour of the new furnace process, and one reports that the Tea made\r\n  by each process is exactly the same.\r\n\r\n  “Colonel Money is now taking steps to erect his improved furnace,\r\n  which will be in working order by the end of September, and the whole\r\n  October crop of Soom Tea will be fired by the new furnace.\r\n\r\n  “Colonel Money has applied for a patent, and as soon as this is\r\n  granted we hope to give our readers a description of the apparatus.\r\n  For obvious reasons it would not be advisable to do so before then.\r\n  We may mention here that one of the most intelligent and practical\r\n  planters in this district has ordered one of Colonel Money’s flues\r\n  for his private garden.\r\n\r\n  “Of the commercial success of Colonel Money’s apparatus we have no\r\n  doubt whatever, and we trust that Colonel Money will reap a handsome\r\n  profit from his very ingenious invention, which will be an undoubted\r\n  boon not only to this district, but to all the Tea-producing\r\n  districts of India.\r\n\r\n  “One point which has struck us as good in Colonel Money’s apparatus\r\n  is that the temperature of the Tea-house is considerably lowered\r\n  during the firing process as compared with the open _chulas_, and\r\n  that there is no free carbonic acid gas allowed to escape into the\r\n  Tea-house, so that those very unpleasant symptoms of slow poisoning\r\n  which often show themselves in planters and Tea-makers will be\r\n  unknown in future. At our suggestion Colonel Money has decided to\r\n  keep a register of the maximum temperature of the Tea-house, whilst\r\n  the open _chulas_ continue in use, and to compare it with the\r\n  temperature when the new apparatus has superseded them, also to test\r\n  for free carbonic acid gas in the air with each process.\r\n\r\n  “We are convinced that when the figures are available our readers\r\n  will be rather astonished at the difference from a sanitary point of\r\n  view.\r\n\r\n  “On the whole, we think that Colonel Money’s invention is by far the\r\n  most important application of _common sense_ and scientific knowledge\r\n  to Tea manufacture that we have yet seen, and we are almost certain\r\n  that his apparatus will before long be adopted throughout the Indian\r\n  Tea districts.”[108]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[108] Note to Third Edition.--No. The furnace has been erected but\r\non two or three gardens. Other inventions have since been brought\r\nforward, and the whole matter is still in an uncertain state--I mean\r\nas to which of the several apparatuses is the best. I believe in mine\r\nstill, and intend to erect it on the Western Dooar Gardens in which I\r\nam interested, but, of course, I am not an impartial judge! One thing,\r\nhowever, I lay claim to, and that is, that I was the first to show by\r\npractical results that the fumes of charcoal are in no way necessary to\r\nmake Tea.\r\n\r\nNote to Fourth Edition.--Since the above note was written (now five\r\nyears ago) many Tea Drying Machines have been invented (see pages 240\r\nto 259), and I most willingly admit they are _all_ better than my\r\nfurnace apparatus. The first inventor rarely attains perfection, and\r\nas in my case, he generally labours for the benefit of those who come\r\nafter!--EDWARD MONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Area required

EDWARD MONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPINIONS OF THE PRESS ON THE THIRD EDITION.\r\n\r\nThe ~Saturday Review~, in the course of an extended notice, says:--“We\r\nthink that Col. Money has done good service by throwing into the form\r\nof a book an essay which gained the Prize awarded by the Agricultural\r\nand Horticultural Society of India, in 1872. The author is one of a\r\nwell-known Anglo-Indian family.... He has had plenty of practical\r\nexperience, and has tested the labours of other men.... Col. Money’s\r\ngeneral rules and principles, as far as we can form a judgment, seem to\r\nhave reason as well as experience on their side.... No tea planter can\r\nafford to disregard his experience.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Indian Agriculturist~ says:--“Col. Money has advanced with the\r\ntimes, and the work under review may well be considered the standard\r\nwork on the subject, and it ought to be in every tea planter’s hand in\r\nIndia, Ceylon, Java, Japan, China or America; the merit and sterling\r\nvalue of his essay has been universally and deservedly acknowledged....\r\nWe recommend our readers who require full information and sound advice\r\non the subject to procure Col. Money’s book.”\r\n\r\n~Allen’s Indian Mail~ says:--“The particulars of this great industry,\r\nwhich comprises (Tea) Cultivation and Manufacture, are given in the\r\nwork of Col. Money. The Third Edition expanded from the original prize\r\nEssay published in 1872, by the results of the author’s practical\r\nexperience and observations up to the present time, supplies full\r\ndetails of the origin and progress of an Indian Tea Garden, and that\r\nin a very lucid and readable form.... The publication of so thorough,\r\nclear and instructive a directorium as Col. Money’s work is in itself a\r\nproof of the attention devoted to this important industry, which has a\r\ngreat future before it. No one who desires to understand the condition\r\nof its development; still more--no one who has a pecuniary interest in\r\na Tea Garden, can feel that the subject of tea is known until this work\r\nhas been studied.”\r\n\r\nThe ~China Express~ says:--“The experience gained since 1872 is added\r\nto the work, and it now forms a most complete guide to the tea planter.\r\nThe great progress the cultivation of tea is making in India renders\r\na practical work of this kind very valuable; and the method in which\r\nColonel Money deals with the subject shows his thorough knowledge of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Scotsman~ says:--“With respect to the conditions of climate and\r\nsoil necessary for successful tea cultivation, the requirements of the\r\nplant in the way of water, &c., the varieties best suited for culture\r\nin the various districts, the laying out of the tea garden, and all the\r\nvarious details of cultivation and manufacture, Colonel Money writes\r\nwith the authority derived from many years of experience; and in the\r\npresent edition the fruits of his latest experience are embodied. To\r\nnew beginners in tea cultivation this book must be of the greatest\r\nvalue, while it will be found full of interest by outsiders who may\r\nbe desirous of information about the condition and prospects of an\r\nimportant department of agricultural industry.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Produce Markets Review~ says:--“Colonel Money is a practical tea\r\nplanter, and his work is the standard work on the subject, so that it\r\nshould be procured by all who are interested in the subject. The new\r\nedition is greatly enlarged, and corrected by the experience of the\r\npast six years.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Planters’ Gazette~ says:--“The cultivation of tea in the British\r\ndominions is becoming a rapidly extending industry, and we are glad to\r\nsee that Colonel Money’s prize essay has reached a third edition, for\r\nit is full of practical information and deserves to be studied by every\r\ntea planter.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Manchester Examiner~ says:--“During the last few years the fact\r\nthat India is a tea-producing country has become more generally known\r\nin England; but few people know that the finest Indian teas are more\r\nexpensive than the best of Chinese growth, and, that the average price\r\nof the tea grown in India is higher than that which comes from the\r\nFlowery Land. Another piece of information given in this book is not\r\nless suggestive; we mean that which assures us that India is capable of\r\nproducing as much tea as would meet the wants of great Britain and all\r\nher colonies. But the culture is yet in its infancy. Colonel Money’s\r\ntreatise is one of the most complete and exhaustive of the kind we\r\nhave ever read. He seems to anticipate all possible difficulties; his\r\nwarnings and his counsels embrace every branch of the subject, and\r\nonly a practical man could have written them. One would think that a\r\ntea grower of common sense could scarcely make blunders with such an\r\nadmirable guide before him; and the commercial side of the enterprise\r\nis discussed in the same careful manner as the agricultural.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Broad Arrow~ says:--“In this work we have the results of eighteen\r\nyears’ experience of a tea planter in India, and the author has so\r\nwritten it that the beginner will find it invaluable, for he has had\r\nhis wants specially in view. It is, so far as we know, the best, as\r\nit is certainly the most practical, book about tea that has been\r\npublished.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Third Edition. Crown 8vo. Cloth, ~3~s. ~6~d._\r\n\r\n  THE ART OF TEA BLENDING.\r\n\r\n  A Handbook for the Tea Trade; a Guide to Tea Merchants, Brokers,\r\n  Dealers and Consumers, in the Secret of Successful Tea Mixing.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPINIONS OF THE PRESS.\r\n\r\nThe ~Field~ says:--“This is a practical and authentic little text book\r\non the principles involved in Tea Blending.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Grocer’s Chronicle~ says:--“The book ought to be in the hands of\r\nevery grocer of the United Kingdom.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Grocer’s Journal~ says:--“We cordially recommend ‘The Art of Tea\r\nBlending’ to our readers as giving useful instruction and guidance.”\r\n\r\n~Allen’s Indian Mail~ says:--“The author gives full technical\r\ninstructions for the professional tea-blender and tea-taster; and in\r\ndoing so, he imparts much information that will be found both valuable\r\nand interesting to the tea-drinking public.”\r\n\r\n~Broad Arrow~ says:--“A trader should be able by its aid to make a name\r\nas a teaman, and realise the result which the housewife only needs--a\r\ngentle hint as to the opportunity of exercising real judgment and\r\ncorrect taste in a matter of such important family interest as tea.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Grocer~ says:--“This is the third edition of a book which we have\r\npreviously noticed with favour, and which has met with considerable\r\nsuccess. Although the art of successful tea-blending is not one\r\nwhich can well be gleaned from mere book-lore--practical experience\r\nbeing essential to its acquisition--there are many young beginners,\r\nand possibly also some older hands, who will derive a good deal of\r\ninformation from the work now under notice. It has evidently been\r\nprepared with much care, and in its way is a very useful handbook.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Daily Chronicle~ says:--“This capital handbook, which will prove\r\nof great service to merchants, brokers, and all engaged in the tea\r\ntrade, has reached a third edition. For consumers we may extract the\r\ninformation that water for making tea should be soft and pure; it\r\nshould be boiled quickly, and used when at the boiling point; the tea\r\nwill be at its best in rather less than ten minutes, losing part of its\r\nflavour if allowed to stand longer.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Grocer’s Gazette~:--“This is a work which has now reached its\r\nthird edition, and which fully bears out its claim as an excellent\r\nhandbook on the subject. Not only is it a useful book to all\r\nprofessionally engaged in the trade, but it is also calculated to\r\neducate those who have not had the benefit of a practical experience,\r\nby teaching them how to obtain a knowledge of the different classes of\r\nteas and the proper method of mixing them. To the mature grocer the\r\nwork will be of interest, while the uninitiated may by its aid learn\r\nhow to select proper teas, please his customer’s palate, and sustain\r\nhis reputation by keeping up the character of his mixings.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Price ~28~s._\r\n\r\n  THE TEA CYCLOPÆDIA.\r\n\r\n  A Compilation, by the Editor of the _Indian Tea Gazette_, of\r\n  Information on Tea, Tea Science and Cultivation, Soils and Manures,\r\n  Statistics, &c., with Coloured Plates on Blights. 350 pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ~Grocer~ says:--“One of the most valuable and exhaustive\r\ncontributions to tea literature which we remember to have seen.... The\r\ncultivation of the plant in the different districts and provinces, the\r\nselection of soils and manures, and buildings for its manufacture, &c.,\r\nare all ably treated in this work; and as it deals thoroughly with the\r\nscientific, statistical, and domestic branches of the subject, it is a\r\nmanual deserving the attention of the tea planter, importer, dealer,\r\nand consumer. The experience of practical growers and cultivators is\r\nhere fully narrated, the opinions of the most competent authorities\r\non disputed points are clearly given and explained; and, in short,\r\nevery matter connected with the history of the tea trade, as a growing\r\nindustry and a widening channel of commerce, is gone into with a\r\ncompleteness and precision which leave nothing to be desired.”\r\n\r\nThe ~American Grocer~ says:--“The Tea Cyclopædia is one we can commend\r\nto our importers, grocers, and dealers, as being the most complete work\r\nof its kind on Indian teas, as well as furnishing innumerable items of\r\ninterest to those engaged in the sale of China and Japan teas.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fancy boards, price ~2~s.

With Frontispiece.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPINIONS OF THE PRESS.\r\n\r\nThe ~Times~ says:--“‘Jemima,’ by Adelaide, is another tale that girls\r\nshould care to read, with sufficient proportion of story, and of a more\r\noriginal type than girls’ books generally are. The humour, of which\r\nthere is an unusual proportion for such works, is not, perhaps, of a\r\nvery subtle or rich quality, but it is easy and simple, and appropriate\r\nto the characters. Any humour, so long as it is neither vulgar nor\r\nobscene, is surely preferable to the long-drawn melancholy which is too\r\napt to pervade girls’ books--for what reason we could never understand;\r\ngirls are no more naturally prone to sadness than boys.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Scotsman~ says:--“A better story of its kind than ‘Jemima’ cannot\r\neasily be met with. The book is written with a freshness and exuberant\r\nbuoyancy of manner that suit the subject admirably.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Academy~ says:--“‘Jemima’ is a very natural and charming story of\r\na very natural and charming little girl. It is exactly what it pretends\r\nto be--‘a story of English family life’--but it has a distinctness of\r\nquality which is by no means common in stories of English family life.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Daily Chronicle~ says:--“The story of English family life told\r\nby Adelaide, under the title of ‘Jemima,’ is of a much more realistic\r\ncharacter. Lively and amusing throughout, there is also an element\r\nof good sense introduced, which keeps the juvenile escapades within\r\nreasonable bounds, and extracts a lesson even from naughtiness.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crown 8vo. 2 vols. ~10~s. each_.\r\n\r\n  VOCABULARY OF THE ENGLISH-MALAY LANGUAGES--\r\n\r\n  With Notes.

It is\r\nastonishing how, by the help of a slight vein of paradox and a nimble\r\nfancy, he can pass, almost imperceptibly, from mild fun to very sad\r\nearnest, touching not a few of our most ingrained faults in the most\r\nefficient way.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Scotsman~ says:--“A clever, wholesome, readable little book.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Homilist~ says:--“The sermons are really good. They have satire,\r\nbut it is satire which consumes religious rubbish and nonsense. They\r\nhave fun and humour, but you are made to laugh in order that you may\r\nthink with more vigour and seriousness.”\r\n\r\nThe ~Freeman~ says:--“The ‘Familiar Texts’ are the old nursery rhymes\r\ntreated homiletically. In the styles adopted we fancy we can trace\r\nresemblances to those of some of the popular preachers of our day. The\r\nwit is not without wisdom. The satire is not destitute of sense. It\r\nis the sort of book that a reader with any humour in him will find it\r\ndifficult to lay down before he has read it right through.”\r\n\r\n~Capital and Labour~ says:--“A droll book and yet containing much\r\nquaint wisdom in searching out and applying principles of truth and\r\ncommon sense....

In all the\r\ndetails of horse management the author is perfectly at home, and the\r\npractical way in which he deals with his subject cannot fail to be\r\nappreciated by equestrians or those who keep studs. The first portion\r\nof the volume is devoted to a lengthy dissertation on the all-important\r\nsubject of Seats and Saddles. These chapters afford much valuable\r\ninformation gained by a careful study, not only of the framework of\r\nthe animal considered from a mechanical point of view, but also of the\r\ninfluence of the saddle in its relation to the seat of the rider.... We\r\nassure our readers that the whole contents of the book are well worth\r\nperusal.
