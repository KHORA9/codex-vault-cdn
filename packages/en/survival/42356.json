THOMAS WILTSHIRE, M.A., F.G.S.,\r\nEtc., President.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersons in general take as the type or representative of chalk the\r\nmaterial which mechanics employ for tracing out rough lines and figures.\r\nIt is a substance of a bright white colour, somewhat yielding to the\r\ntouch, and capable of being very easily abraded or rubbed down.\r\n\r\nBut the geologist gives a much wider interpretation to the term, not\r\nlimiting it by these few characteristics; and, accordingly, he includes\r\nunder the same title many strata which would hardly be so grouped\r\ntogether by the uninitiated.\r\n\r\nFor instance, there is at the base of the upper portion of the\r\ncretaceous system a certain hard, often pebbly, and highly coloured\r\nband, which, notwithstanding its great departure from the popular type,\r\nis nevertheless styled in geological language the \"Red Chalk.\" This\r\nstratum, the subject of the present paper, nowhere forms a mass of\r\nany great thickness or extent; perhaps if thirty feet be taken as its\r\nmaximum of thickness, four feet as its minimum, and one hundred miles\r\nas its utmost extent in length, the truth will be arrived at. It may be\r\nsaid, also, to be peculiar to England, for the _Scaglia_, or Red Chalk\r\nof the Italians, has little in common with that of our country. The two\r\ndiffer widely in appearance, in situation, and in fossils.\r\n\r\nThe first view of the seam in the north is to be obtained about six\r\nmiles north-west of Flamborough Head, in Yorkshire, near the village\r\nof Speeton, where its structure, dip, and general appearance can be\r\nremarkably well studied.\r\n\r\nSpeeton is a small village, a place of no great note in the\r\nbusiness-world, yet of much fame amongst the lovers of geology, inasmuch\r\nas in its neighbourhood there are several interesting formations, to one\r\nof which--the Speeton clay--it gives a name.\r\n\r\nIn these days of rapid travelling, the village has the great convenience\r\nof a railway-station, from whence the cliffs below can be reached\r\nwithout the slightest difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 1.--Map of Part of Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and\r\nNorfolk, showing the Outcrop and Range of the Red Chalk.]\r\n\r\nAs I wish to conduct the members of the Association to the Red Chalk _in\r\nsitû_, let us suppose that, starting from some locality near the Hull\r\nand Scarborough Railway, we have taken tickets for Speeton station, and\r\nhave in due time arrived at that latter place. On alighting from the\r\ntrain we must direct our steps to the houses in front, and then inquire\r\nthe way to the sea-shore, above which we shall be standing at some\r\nconsiderable height--say four hundred feet. We shall be told to walk\r\nby the church, to turn to the right along a little lane, and then to\r\nlook for an obscure path which passes across the fields. We shall soon\r\nafterwards, being on high ground, be able, by the light of nature, to\r\nfind a way down to the sands below.\r\n\r\nWhilst descending, let us survey the scene that lies before us. It is a\r\ngrand one, rendered picturesque by the broken ground, the solitude, and\r\nthe sounding of the waves. Right ahead, there is the open Bay of Filey;\r\non the left hand, the town of Filey and its Brig; not a ship, as one\r\nmight imagine, but a huge mass of rocks of the coralline oolite, jutting\r\nout to sea at right angles from the shore, like a pier formed by human\r\nhands, and crowned on the land-side by strangely cut pinnacles of pink\r\nand rugged drift. On the right hand there are the high and perpendicular\r\nwhite chalk cliffs of the Flamborough range. As we pass down we shall\r\nmeet with a gulley or bed of a small stream, in all probability quite\r\ndry, by following the winding course of which we shall reach the shore.\r\nThis gulley passes over an escarpment of diluvial matter (the whole\r\nplace being in confusion through the effects of small landslips),\r\nand traverses the Red Chalk itself, the first trace of which will be\r\nrendered visible by means of rolled fragments, which the force of the\r\nstream has at different times detached.\r\n\r\nIt will be only here and there that we shall find the Red Chalk _in\r\nsitû_, because sometimes vegetation, sometimes diluvium, sometimes\r\nfallen masses, entirely conceal its real position. However, there will\r\nbe plenty of rounded pieces at the feet. Some of these had better be\r\nexamined on the spot, in order that we may gain a clear perception of\r\nthe appearance of the bed, should we meet with it again. These pieces\r\nare found to be hard and rough to the touch, and of a bright red tinge,\r\nthough occasionally marked with streaks of white. Most likely on some\r\nof their sides a fossil or two will be seen peeping out; a blow from a\r\nhammer will divulge still more. So plentiful are the rolled fragments,\r\nthat a few hours' work will satisfy the conscience, and fill the pockets\r\nof the traveller.\r\n\r\nIf I might be permitted to give advice to any member of our Association\r\nwho should hereafter visit the place, it would be this--that it would\r\nbe well for him to carry away moderate sized boulders entire, rather\r\nthan to break them on the spot. The fossils will best be developed at\r\nleisure. The material is so hard, and the fossils so brittle (especially\r\nthe belemnites and serpulæ), that imperfect specimens only will result\r\nfrom the quick and rough treatment of the hammer. The \"find\" will not\r\nproduce any very great variety, only numbers; terebratulæ, serpulæ, and\r\nbelemnites will be all that will be obtained.\r\n\r\nHaving now procured specimens, we had better walk southward along the\r\nshore; after a short time will be seen a fine perpendicular section of\r\nthis particular stratum; we shall notice it is bounded on the one side\r\nby the White Chalk, to which it is parallel; on the other by the Speeton\r\nclay, which is not conformable to it, that is, not parallel.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the bed of the Red Chalk is at this place, as I said\r\njust now, about thirty feet. First of all, taking it in descending\r\norder, that is to say, having reached its limit at the White Chalk, and\r\nretracing our steps in the direction of Filey, we notice about twelve\r\nfeet of red matter containing serpulæ, and we note that the upper\r\nportion of this division is much filled with greyish nodules, showing\r\nthat the change from the White Chalk to the Red is gradual. Next comes\r\na bed of about seven feet thick, of darkish White Chalk; and finally,\r\nanother bed of about twelve feet thick, of bright Red Chalk, containing\r\nbelemnites and terebratulæ. The whole is followed by the Speeton clay,\r\nof which a short and accurate account will be found in No. 13 of THE\r\nGEOLOGIST magazine. The line of division between these two being\r\nwell marked by runs of water, which are caused by the percolation\r\nthrough the chalk being stopped by the impervious clay.\r\n\r\nThe Speeton clay is singular in some of its characteristics. At its\r\nupper portion, in contact with the Red Chalk, it contains fossils\r\nbelonging to the Neocomian or Greensand era, whilst at the lower part\r\nthere are the representatives of the Kimmeridge clay. And thus it would\r\nappear to be one of those peculiar formations which have resulted from\r\na number of beds thinning out, and becoming absorbed into each other.\r\nThree of the well-marked fossils of the Speeton clay may be adduced:\r\n_Belemnites jaculum_; a small crustacean, _Astacus ornatus_; and a large\r\nhamite, called _Hamites Beanii_.\r\n\r\nTo the south of the Red Chalk at Speeton, and adjoining it, occurs,\r\nas I lately mentioned, the White Chalk. The fossils in this part are\r\nnot numerous; an inoceramus, a terebratula, and rarely an ammonite,\r\nare found. But the White Chalk higher up, that is, farther south,\r\nbelow Flamborough Head, near Bridlington Quay, is very fossiliferous,\r\ncontaining corals, echini, a bed of marsupites, as well as that very\r\nremarkable and extensive collection of marine forms, the silicified\r\nsponges, thousands of which can be seen at low water scattered up and\r\ndown, and imbedded in the scars, or rocks. This chalk, however, has its\r\ndrawbacks, for being very hard--indeed, so much so as to ring under the\r\nstrokes of a hammer--specimens cannot be obtained without much trouble.\r\nI must make an exception with regard to the sponges. They are composed\r\nof silex; hence, long soaking in very dilute hydrochloric acid will do\r\nmore and better work after the fossils have been brought home, than\r\nfifty chisels. The calcareous matter is slowly dissolved away, and then\r\nforms come into view as delicate and lovely as any that can be noted in\r\nthe modern sponge tribe. Most of the common kinds of the Flamborough\r\nsponges will be found figured and named in Professor Phillips' Geology\r\nof Yorkshire; the rarer in the Magazine of Natural History for 1839.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the village of Speeton, and endeavour to follow the\r\nwinding course of the Red Chalk to its visible termination, some hundred\r\nmiles to the south-east, in the county of Norfolk.\r\n\r\nBy a reference to the map (page 2), where the bed is laid down, it\r\nis seen that the Red Chalk adjoins the White Chalk during its entire\r\nlength; that it first takes a westerly direction for about twenty miles,\r\nand then suddenly turning at a sharp angle proceeds south-east for the\r\nremainder of its course.\r\n\r\nSome persons might suppose when they see the map, that if they were to\r\ntravel to any of the towns or villages near the line, they would of\r\nnecessity be able to see the Red Chalk _in sitû_. No such thing; the\r\nupper soil, or vegetation, or man's work, may quite conceal all traces.\r\nIt is only at natural sections like the cliffs just spoken of, or by\r\nother means, such as wells, &c., that we can acquire a true idea of the\r\nground beneath us. Who, for example, that lives in the City of London,\r\ncould imagine, unless he had seen the fact for himself, when sewers were\r\nopened, or foundations cut, that he was dwelling over beds of gravel as\r\nbright and yellow as any that cover the paths of a flower-garden?\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the nature of the surface of the ground is such that\r\nthe eyes cannot detect traces of any particular formation we may be in\r\nsearch of, we must seek other testimony, we must ask what have other men\r\nseen, and what have they recorded, and in whose custody have they placed\r\nthe keeping of those facts.\r\n\r\nIn the present case I can refer to two excellent works, to help\r\nus,--Professor Phillips' Geology of Yorkshire, and Young and Bird's\r\nSurvey of the Yorkshire Coast.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to the latter. The authors write that in the year 1819 a\r\nMr. George Rivis, of Sherburn, bored for coal in a deep dale about a\r\nmile and a half south of Staxton; the boring was continued for some\r\nconsiderable depth. First they passed through the White Chalk, next came\r\nupon the Red seam, and finally, at the depth of 288 feet from the mouth\r\nof the bore, reached the Speeton clay. Thus then near Staxton, a few\r\nmiles west of Speeton, the Red Chalk exists; there it is, though it may\r\nnot be visible.\r\n\r\nIf we proceed still farther west along the northern foot of the\r\nYorkshire Wolds, it is possible that at Knapton we shall actually see\r\nthe Red and White Chalk again _in sitû_; for Young and Bird tell us\r\nthat, at a clay-pit near that village, it was to be seen in their day.\r\nAt North Grimston, they add, the coloured chalk seems to be wanting, for\r\nat a copious spring issuing on the hill-side, about a mile above the\r\nvillage, the White Chalk is seen lying immediately over the blue clay.\r\n\r\nThis statement is not to be wondered at. Look at the map (page 2). Not\r\nfar from North Grimston there must evidently be great unconformity of\r\nstrata. Notice several of the formations, instead of running parallel\r\nto one another, actually are at right angles. For instance, we have\r\nthe Speeton clay, the oolites, and the lias, almost perpendicular in\r\ndirection to the White Chalk, a little to the west of Great Driffield.\r\nSuch a condition of affairs must have resulted from great disturbances,\r\nand there would be nothing strange in a part of the series being\r\ndisplaced or altogether wanting.\r\n\r\nSome miles to the south, near the town of Pocklington, the strata are\r\nagain parallel in direction to each other, and accordingly the Red Chalk\r\nis found, as before, at the base of the Wolds. Professor Phillips, in\r\nhis work on the Geology of Yorkshire, figures some Red Chalk fossils\r\nfrom Goodmanham, near Market Weighton, and alludes to their also\r\noccurring at Brantingham, not far from the River Humber, the boundary of\r\nthe county.\r\n\r\nThus, then, the Red Chalk has been traced through Yorkshire; speaking\r\nroughly one might say, that it for the most part takes an undulating\r\ncourse at the base of the Wolds; that it rises with a very gentle\r\ninclination from the sea near the village of Speeton; that it proceeds\r\nnearly due west until it approaches the neighbourhood of Malton, that\r\nit then suddenly changes its direction, and advances south-east until\r\nit sinks below the marsh-land six or seven miles to the west of Hull,\r\nhaving occupied a distance of about fifty miles.\r\n\r\nWe now cross the river Humber, and find the Red Chalk again near the\r\nbanks at a place called Ferraby, to the west of Barton in Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\nThe Museum of the Geological Society of London possesses specimens taken\r\nfrom that part, and in a note attached to them there is this remark,\r\nthat first came White Chalk, then Red Chalk, then a blue clay; thus it\r\nis evident there is the same state of things prevailing as we had at\r\nSpeeton; and the same observation will apply to the appearance of the\r\nspecimens themselves.\r\n\r\nBut as we travel along the western base of the Lincolnshire Wolds, or\r\nChalk Downs (for Londoners would so term them), although we find the\r\nRed Chalk underneath the White, yet the blue clay beneath the Red Chalk\r\nis wanting; its place is supplied by a thick series of brown coloured\r\nsands, with included beds of sandy limestone, full of fossils like the\r\nKentish Rag, only not possessing echini and belemnites. These beds have\r\nbeen referred to the lower greensand.\r\n\r\nOnly a few remarks can be offered in reference to Lincolnshire. My\r\nintention was to have visited the base of the chalk-hills, and have\r\ngathered together new facts; I have not been able to do so; neither have\r\nI been successful in discovering any authors who have written much about\r\nthat county. There is a great geological darkness over that land, and\r\nmuch remains to be done in working out its fossiliferous deposits. I\r\ncan, however, speak confidently regarding Louth.\r\n\r\nOne might fancy, as the town is placed to the right of the dark line on\r\nthe map, which marks the position of the Red Chalk, that Louth could\r\nhave nothing to do with the latter. But a friend who made some inquiries\r\nfor me on the spot has forwarded two specimens, and says he saw them\r\ntaken out of a chalk-pit at that town. They ran in veins, he writes,\r\nthe lighter coloured over the darker, and were dug at no great distance\r\nbelow the surface. The bright red piece was just above where the springs\r\narise--facts which correspond with evidence in other places.\r\n\r\nAs the inclination of the plane of the strata is small, and rising\r\ntowards the south-west (the direction of the strata being north-west),\r\nit is easily comprehended that the Red Chalk may exist under Louth, and\r\nyet not appear at the surface of the ground until at some distance to\r\nthe west of the town.\r\n\r\nAt Brickhill, near Harrington, the seam also has been met with; a\r\nspecimen of it can be seen in the Museum of the Geological Society of\r\nLondon. This last and those from Louth differ little in appearance or\r\ncharacter from what may be obtained at the Speeton beds.\r\n\r\nI have no more to say about Lincolnshire, except that, according to the\r\nauthority of geological maps, the Red Chalk of that county sinks and\r\ndisappears below the marsh-lands, a few miles before reaching the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd now it is time to cross the Wash, that great sea-bay, and land at\r\nHunstanton, a little village on the north-western coast of Norfolk. As\r\nI am addressing a company of working geologists, I ought perhaps to say\r\nhow in practice the locality can be arrived at, for it is not quite so\r\neasy to reach a place in reality as it is to see it on a map.\r\n\r\nTo go to Hunstanton, in the most ready way, a person must first reach\r\nLynn; whence an omnibus, starting in the afternoon, at three or four\r\no'clock, from the Lynn station, will convey passengers to the village.\r\n\r\nAt Hunstanton there are two hotels, and several lodging-houses. I should\r\nrecommend the Le Strange Arms, as being an old-fashioned comfortable\r\ninn, and nearer than the other to the section we are in quest of.\r\nPerhaps it may be thought, Why dwell so much upon Hunstanton--its\r\nhotel--and its omnibus? I do so because at that village there is a most\r\nexcellent natural section of the Red Chalk, better almost than at\r\nSpeeton, and different certainly in many respects.\r\n\r\nWe will suppose that we have arrived at Hunstanton, and are walking\r\ntowards the shore in front of the Le Strange Arms. A very few minutes\r\nwill convey us to the wonderful cliff. I say wonderful, not from its\r\nheight or length; for at its greatest height, under the lighthouse, it\r\nis not more than sixty feet; and it extends little more than a mile in\r\nlength; but wonderful from its curious colour and general effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 2.--Hunstanton Cliff (looking to the North)]\r\n\r\nThe woodcut, copied from a water-colour drawing, made last autumn by a\r\nfriend, will afford an idea of its appearance; but in it the absence of\r\ncolour, of course, takes away from the beauty of the scene.\r\n\r\nThe cliff itself may be divided into five portions: first, White Chalk,\r\nforty feet thick; secondly, bright Red Chalk, four feet; thirdly, a\r\nyellow sandy mass, ten feet; fourthly, a dark brown pebbly stratum,\r\nforty feet; and, lastly, twenty feet of a bed almost black.\r\n\r\nThese divisions do not run one into the other, as is the case in most\r\ngeological strata, but keep quite distinct. Thus the Red Chalk is as\r\nclearly separated from the White, as though the one had been covered by\r\na broad band of paint. The same observation will hold good with respect\r\nto the others.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be understood that when the sun shines upon the cliff,\r\nand lights up the bright white, the bright red, the pale yellow, and the\r\ndark brown and black, and casts a shadow over the mass of gaily tinted\r\nmaterials at the base, a picture is produced not easy to be surpassed in\r\nbeauty, and certainly not to be fully appreciated unless it be actually\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe bed of White Chalk above the Red is, at Hunstanton, very\r\nfossiliferous; though rendered somewhat useless, like that of Yorkshire,\r\nto the geologist, from its extreme hardness. Amongst other shells, may\r\nbe mentioned several kinds of serpulæ, belemnites, and ammonites. These\r\nlast are occasionally very large: when I was at Hunstanton, in the\r\nautumn, I found an example two feet in diameter; with great difficulty I\r\nextricated it from its matrix, breaking it in half during the operation;\r\nand, finally, had the mortification of discovering that its weight was\r\nso great I could not carry it away.\r\n\r\nThe Red Chalk beneath, which is nearly four feet in thickness, is very\r\nfull of fossils: belemnites, serpulæ, terebratulæ, corals, and many\r\nothers, not to mention bones. The number of specimens on the table will\r\ntestify to its richness in organic remains.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is soft and crumbling; but, generally speaking, it is very\r\nhard, gritty, of a bright red shade, and full of small dark-coloured\r\nsiliceous pebbles; in this respect differing considerably from the Red\r\nChalk of Speeton--in which I have not seen pebbles. Professor Tennant,\r\nwho has examined the Hunstanton pebbles, informs me that they consist of\r\n_chalcedony_, _quartz_, _flint_, _slate_, and _brown spar_ or _carbonate\r\nof iron_.\r\n\r\nIt also contains a great quantity of fragments of inocerami, and a\r\ncurious ramifying sponge-like structure (there is one on the table),\r\nwhich also occurs in the White Chalk above.\r\n\r\nSomething very similar to the ramifying sponge is seen on the surface\r\nof blocks on the sea-shore at the back of the Isle of Wight in the\r\ngreensand formation, and one very like it on the calcareous grit of the\r\nYorkshire shore. You will observe these last to the north of Filey, but\r\nnothing of the same appearance exists in the White Chalk at Speeton.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the Red Chalk of Hunstanton occurs a yellow and brown pebbly\r\nsandstone, which was formerly supposed to contain no organic remains.\r\nMr. C. B. Rose of Yarmouth, however, has obtained many.\r\n\r\nThis bed is termed in those parts \"carstone,\" and much employed as\r\na building-material. The cottages in that neighbourhood and on the\r\nroad from Lynn seem at a distance as though they had been constructed\r\nof masses of gingerbread, so great is the similarity in colour and\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe length of the Red Chalk, from end to end, at the Hunstanton Cliff\r\nis about 1,000 yards, and its greatest elevation at the point where it\r\nattains the top and quits the cliff is thirty-seven feet; hence its rise\r\nis very gradual, since its first appearance is nearly on a level with\r\nthe beach.\r\n\r\nThere are two other things worth observing at Hunstanton. One is the\r\nlighthouse, which is upon the dioptric principle, the light being\r\ntransmitted out to sea by means of glass prisms instead of the ordinary\r\nmetal reflectors; and the other is a vestige of a raised sea-beach\r\non the cliffs composed of rounded fragments of White and Red Chalk\r\nimmediately reposing on the greensand. It is situated at the southward\r\nof the point where the Red Chalk crops out.\r\n\r\nWe will now, if you please, quit Hunstanton, and proceed towards Lynn,\r\nkeeping in the neighbourhood of the coach-road.\r\n\r\nIf we could dig up the ground when we were within eight or nine miles\r\nof Lynn, we should still see our old companion at our feet, for the\r\nRed Chalk has been recognised at the villages of Ingoldsthorpe and\r\nDersingham.\r\n\r\nWe shall soon meet it no more. At Leziate, a little to the north-east\r\nof Lynn, it becomes extinct. Mr. C. B. Rose, who always thought the Red\r\nChalk would prove to be the equivalent of the gault, and who argued\r\nfrom the evidence of fossils and from the direction of the outcrops\r\nthat the true gault and the Red Chalk must ultimately meet,--Mr. Rose,\r\nI say, has informed me that he has observed the Red Chalk and the gault\r\nincorporated together at Leziate. Henceforward to the south the Red\r\nChalk is no more seen.\r\n\r\nThus, then, we have come to the termination of our journey. We have\r\nnoted the beginning and the ending of the Red Chalk, we have also\r\ntaken some account of its neighbours. We have noticed, too, that in\r\nYorkshire it for the most part reposes on the Speeton clay, though in\r\ncertain localities it is next the lias and Kimmeridge clay, and that in\r\nLincolnshire and Norfolk it rests on a dark brown pebbly mass supposed\r\nto belong to the lower greensand formation of the south of England.\r\n\r\nThe Red Chalk has also been discovered in a very unexpected place,\r\nalthough not _in sitû_. I allude to the drift of Muswell Hill. In that\r\ncollection of different materials, comprising examples from every\r\nformation from the London clay to the mountain limestone in a stratum of\r\neighteen feet, the Red Chalk has been seen in a bouldered condition.\r\n\r\nBy the kindness of Mr. Wetherell of Highgate, I am enabled to exhibit\r\nspecimens from the drift of Muswell Hill. Any person who compares them\r\nwith others from Hunstanton, would declare they came from the same bed,\r\nso alike are they in appearance.\r\n\r\nThere was a time no doubt when this Red Chalk had a more extended range:\r\nits presence in the drift of Muswell Hill, as well as in the drift of\r\nother places, implies as much. Perhaps it may still exist elsewhere,\r\ndeep down in the earth.\r\n\r\nIn a well sunk at Stowmarket a red substance was found under the White\r\nChalk, at a depth of 900 feet; and in another well sunk at Kentish Town,\r\nthe workmen met, at a depth of 1,113 feet below the surface, beneath\r\nthe gault, a bed of red matter 188 feet thick--some of this red matter\r\nappeared to contain belemnites.\r\n\r\nGeologists are divided in opinion with respect to this deep-sunk red\r\nbed, which certainly is not always continuous (for instance, it was not\r\nfound at a boring at Harwich), and some incline to the opinion that it\r\nbelongs to the New Red, others that it is the equivalent of what is\r\nstyled the Red Chalk. But it is difficult to give a solution at present.\r\nIt is certain that in the gault formation, or near it, beds of a red\r\ncolour are occasionally found. Near Dorking the lower greensand is\r\ncapped by a local bed of bright red clay, eight feet thick. And examples\r\nof red clays from the gault of Ringmer in Sussex and Charing in Kent can\r\nbe seen in the Museum of the Geological Society of London. Whether they\r\nhave any relation with the Red Chalk proper of England depends upon the\r\nposition which is given to that formation.\r\n\r\nGeologists generally consider the Red Chalk as really equal to the\r\nGault. Many of the fossils certainly are gault species; others no doubt\r\nbelong to the Lower Chalk; and, therefore, probably it is better to\r\nregard it as an intermediate formation between the Lower Chalk and\r\nthe Lower Greensand, which comes into being when the Gault and Upper\r\nGreensand have almost thinned out.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of our Committee, Mr. Rickard, has been good enough\r\nto make me an analysis of the Red Chalk of Speeton and Hunstanton. The\r\nSpeeton is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Carbonate of lime, with a little alumina       81.2\r\n    Peroxide of iron                                4.3\r\n    Silica                                         14.5\r\n                                                  -----\r\n                                                  100.\r\n                                                  -----\r\n\r\nFrom Hunstanton--\r\n\r\n    Carbonate of lime, with a little alumina       82.3\r\n    Peroxide of iron                                6.4\r\n    Silica                                         11.3\r\n                                                  -----\r\n                                                  100.\r\n                                                  -----\r\n\r\nThe latter of which agrees remarkably well with the colour of the\r\nspecimen, for the Red Chalk of Hunstanton is brighter than that of\r\nSpeeton.\r\n\r\nTwo specimens of the borings of Kentish Town, one a red argillaceous and\r\nthe other a siliceous mass, gave the following results:--\r\n\r\nArgillaceous--\r\n\r\n    Peroxide of iron                               6.5\r\n    Carbonate of lime                             13.5\r\n    Silica and alumina (chiefly the latter)       80.0\r\n                                                 -----\r\n                                                 100.\r\n                                                 -----\r\n\r\nSiliceous--\r\n\r\n    Peroxide of iron                              2.5\r\n    Carbonate of lime                            23.5\r\n    Silica, with a little alumina                74.0\r\n                                                -----\r\n                                                100.\r\n                                                -----\r\n\r\nWhether any connexion can be traced between these last two and the two\r\nformer, I leave for others to decide.\r\n\r\nThe following list of books may perhaps be useful to those who wish to\r\nfurther investigate the subject:--In\r\n\r\n     Professor Phillips' Geology of Yorkshire,\r\n\r\n     Young and Bird's Survey of the Yorkshire Coast,\r\n\r\n     Dr. Fitton's Memoir of the Strata below the Chalk,\r\n\r\n     Taylor's Hunstanton Cliff (Phil.

The former\r\n     occurs only at Speeton and the latter at Hunstanton; in order to\r\n     distinguish the two, the title \"irregularis\" may be applied to the\r\n     latter as a variety.\r\n\r\n     Serpula triserrata, a species found on a specimen of Ammonites\r\n     complanatus, is distinguishable by its three serrate longitudinal\r\n     ridges. A similar form occurs on ostreæ from the Kimmeridge clay of\r\n     West Norfolk.\r\n\r\n     Terebratula semiglobosa is common at Speeton, but very rare at\r\n     Hunstanton. T. biplicata is very common at Hunstanton, but is not\r\n     known at Speeton.\r\n\r\n     Inoceramus læviusculus, Bean, a large smooth species something\r\n     like I. Cuvieri.\r\n\r\n     The Ammonites alternatus of Woodward is now lost; it was\r\n     probably a variety of A. serratus, Park.\r\n\r\n     Belemnites minimus is sometimes two inches long in the\r\n     Hunstanton Cliff.\r\n\r\n     The vertebra of Polyptychodon would be, if perfect, about six\r\n     inches in diameter and three in thickness.\r\n\r\n     The small specimen shown in Plate II. fig. 9 evidently belongs\r\n     to the Turbinolian family of corals, and possibly to the genus\r\n     Trochocyathus instituted by Messrs. Milne-Edwards and J. Haime, in\r\n     1848. The specimens as yet obtained are not sufficiently numerous\r\n     nor perfect for a rigid comparison with other forms, or to admit\r\n     of a sufficiently detailed description should the species prove\r\n     to be new. The constricted form of growth is very common in the\r\n     Parasmilia of the Upper Chalk, and has no specific value.\r\n\r\n     The characteristic fossils of the Red Chalk at Speeton are\r\n     Terebratula semiglobosa, Belemnites minimus, and Vermicularia\r\n     elongata; and at Hunstanton, Terebratula biplicata, Belemnites\r\n     minimus, and Spongia paradoxica.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have endeavoured all along to confine myself to\r\nfacts, and to abstain from theories, because I think the Geologists'\r\nAssociation ought rather to follow in the steps of learned men than to\r\nwish to take the lead. I am sure by doing so we shall gain respect. If\r\nthe strictly scientific workers see we wish to acquire information,\r\nrather than to purchase an empty name, they will hold out the right hand\r\nof fellowship and help us mightily; whilst, on the contrary, if they\r\nperceive we aspire too much, and attempt to grasp what we cannot hold,\r\nthen well-merited ridicule will undoubtedly be ours. The Geologists'\r\nAssociation was only formed to bring amateurs together, to give them a\r\nplace to meet in, and a room where they could speak on kindred subjects.\r\nI trust the members will always use the opportunity, and not be afraid\r\nto speak, ever remembering that each one has some little knowledge which\r\nhis neighbour has not, and that when each helps his fellow, much must be\r\nthe gain at last.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pl.
