For one, I’m tired of this stuffy railroad\r\ncar.”\r\n\r\n“That isn’t all our trouble by a long shot, Andy Bowles. You must\r\nremember that two shavings of railway lunch-counter sandwiches don’t\r\ngo _very_ far toward satisfying a growing boy’s appetite.”\r\n\r\n“I thought we would soon hear that cry for help from Tubby. His mind\r\nseems to run along the eating groove most of the time. A _growing_\r\nboy, eh? If he keeps on expanding much more, he’ll be as big as a\r\nhogshead, I reckon.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! well, one consolation is you’ll all have to quit calling me\r\nTubby, then. Say, we must be getting somewhere near that town of\r\nWyoming,--how about it, Rob?”\r\n\r\nThere were four of them occupying seats that faced each other,--all\r\nwearing the well-known khaki suits that mark scouts pretty much the\r\nwhole world over these modern days.\r\n\r\nThe very stout chap with the freckled, good-natured face was Tubby\r\nHopkins. Sim Jeffords was of rather lean build, with a shrewd look\r\nin his keen eyes; Andy Bowles was the one whose cheeks every now and\r\nthen expanded as though in imagination he might be practicing some\r\nnew bugle call, for Andy had long been recognized as the official\r\n“reveille” and “taps” manipulator of the troop; and last, but far\r\nfrom least, was Rob Blake, the determined leader of the Eagle\r\nPatrol, who sometimes acted also as assistant master to the Hampton\r\nTroop.\r\n\r\nThese four comrades, tried and true, came from Long Island, and they\r\nhad been riding for some hours on a train heading up into the\r\ninterior of New York State. Part of the Eagle Patrol had passed\r\nthrough rather remarkable adventures in various parts of our own\r\ncountry and abroad as well. Those who are making their acquaintance\r\nfor the first time in these pages, and who would like to know more\r\nconcerning their aims and ambitions, as well as some of the stirring\r\nthings that came their way, are advised to secure recent volumes of\r\nthis series, where they will find tales of many lively happenings\r\nwell calculated to please them.\r\n\r\nLately, the boys of the Eagle Patrol had been concerned in the\r\nquestion of national preparedness, and in their role of scouts\r\nproved considerable help to Government officials who were wrestling\r\nwith a number of serious problems.\r\n\r\nThe vacation season was wearing on after their return home from New\r\nJersey, and things around Hampton had begun to assume their habitual\r\nmid-summer stagnation when Sim Jeffords broached an idea to the\r\npatrol leader that rather fascinated Rob.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that Sim had a Cousin Ralph who lived up in the State not\r\nfar from the heart of the famous Adirondack region, where his father\r\nowned a large farm of hundreds of acres a few miles from the\r\nbustling manufacturing town of--well, let us call it Wyoming, because\r\nfor certain reasons it might not be wholly advisable to locate it\r\npositively.\r\n\r\nThis cousin appeared to have a “grouch,” as Sim called it,\r\nconcerning the subject of Boy Scouts. He believed they were an\r\noverrated lot of boys who somehow managed to advertise themselves in\r\nthe newspapers, but who, after all, could not begin to “hold a\r\ncandle” to some outside fellows of practical experience.\r\n\r\nSome of the correspondence between the cousins when shown to Rob\r\namused him; and at the same time he could not help feeling just a\r\nlittle annoyed at the “jabs” which the said Ralph continued to give\r\nthe movement.\r\n\r\nMore than once he had said he would like to know the Adirondack boy,\r\nbecause he believed he could manage to convert him and influence him\r\nto join a scout troop.\r\n\r\nThe more Rob heard about several activities on the part of Ralph\r\nJeffords, the greater his interest grew. If the farm boy could show\r\nsuch surprising aptitude in Nature study and so wide a knowledge of\r\nthe habits of wild animals as his interesting letters indicated, Rob\r\nfelt sure he would make a most valuable addition to the ranks of the\r\nkhaki-clad scouts.\r\n\r\nHence, when Sim came and read how his cousin had actually invited\r\nhim to fetch several of his chums along up to the farm and see what\r\na fellow who made no pretense to publicity could accomplish in\r\nseveral lines of outdoor work, Rob “fell” for the scheme instantly.\r\nThis expedition was the result of his growing desire to meet Ralph\r\nJeffords on his own heath and convince him that scouts were not at\r\nall overrated, as he seemed to believe.\r\n\r\nWith this short but necessary digression, we can go back again to\r\nthe four boys whose lively talk will doubtless explain many other\r\nthings connected with their enterprise.\r\n\r\n“Well,” Rob Blake observed in answer to Tubby’s question, “according\r\nto this railroad folder which I got hold of before leaving New York\r\nCity, we are right now at a little way-station called Jupiter, and I\r\nfigure that Wyoming lies just seven miles further along the line. At\r\nthe rate we are going we should be there in ten or twelve minutes.”\r\n\r\n“It ought to be a paying trip for us, I should say,” observed Andy,\r\nthoughtfully. “First of all there’s that stump-blowing business by\r\nthe use of dynamite, which I’ve always wanted to see done. Ralph\r\nsays they have cleared many acres in that way; and, besides, his\r\nfather, being an advanced scientific farmer, is meaning to make use\r\nof dynamite to break up the soil. They say pulverizing it many feet\r\ndown has resulted in wonderful crops of grain and garden sass.”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” added Sim, “and I think I speak for Rob, I’m\r\ninterested in what my cousin has been doing with his fur farm. You\r\nknow, his father fenced in a hundred acres of his wildest land, and\r\nfor a year or two now Ralph has been experimenting in raising black\r\nfoxes for the market. He hasn’t told me a great deal about it, but\r\nwhat little I know has excited me a heap.”\r\n\r\n“Then he’s actually succeeded in raising litters of pups, has he?”\r\nasked Tubby.\r\n\r\n“I understand he has succeeded more than fairly well,” answered Sim,\r\nproudly, for it was his own cousin of whom they were speaking,\r\nbearing the family name of Jeffords, too, which counted for a lot\r\nwith a boy. “Lately he’s branched out some, and I believe he’s not\r\nonly started a skunk farm in a fenced-in corner of his ‘preserves,’\r\nbut is going to try raising mink and otter, something that has\r\nreally never been done before.”\r\n\r\n“My stars! but that cousin of yours is ambitious!” gasped Tubby,\r\nthough, not much given to energetic movements himself, could at\r\nleast admire any one who showed a disposition that way. “The only\r\nthing I ever thought I’d like to raise in that fashion was frogs,\r\nbecause frogs, you know, have dandy shanks that taste just like\r\nspring chicken. I never could get enough of ’em when we camped out.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! maybe you will up at my cousin’s place,” said Sim,\r\nindifferently, “for he used to have a pond just _swarming_ with\r\nhusky bull-frogs as big as your hat. You’ll have a jolly old time\r\nknocking ’em over and fixing ’em for all of us, Tubby.”\r\n\r\n“I agree to handle the job, and would like nothing better,” snapped\r\nthe stout boy, his face one broad grin of expectancy, as though an\r\nambition he had cherished for many a moon was in a fair way of being\r\nrealized at last; they could also see Tubby work his jaws as though\r\nhis mouth fairly watered at the anticipation of the feasts in store.\r\n\r\nA short time afterward the train was drawing close to Wyoming.\r\nClouds of smoke told that there was considerable manufacturing done;\r\nand when finally they found themselves going into the station, Rob\r\nmade up his mind that the mountain town was a pretty lively place.\r\nHe wondered how it ever came that it had never had a scout troop\r\nstarted; and began to suspect there must be something of the feeling\r\nRalph Jeffords had voiced impregnating the entire community.\r\n\r\nTo himself Rob was saying that it certainly looked as though these\r\nbenighted people needed some sort of practical demonstration of the\r\nvalue to any community an efficient scout troop was always bound to\r\nbe. He secretly hoped that before he and his comrades of the Eagle\r\nPatrol left that region an opportunity might arise whereby they\r\ncould give these folks an object lesson calculated to bear fruit an\r\nhundred fold.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, little did Rob Blake suspect just then what a\r\nwonderful chance to prove their worth was destined to be offered to\r\nhimself and three chums; but in good time all that will be set\r\nbefore the reader.\r\n\r\n“There’s Ralph!” suddenly ejaculated Sim, as with their luggage in\r\nhand they prepared to leave the car platform, for the train had now\r\nstopped at the station.\r\n\r\nA sturdily built young chap, whom Rob instantly liked at first\r\nsight, advanced toward them. If Ralph was a farmer’s son, he did not\r\nlook very countrified; but, then, the fact of his father being\r\nwell-to-do had enabled the boy to attend high school, and secure all\r\nthe advantages that go with an education.\r\n\r\nSim grasped him by the hand, though immediately wincing under the\r\npressure Ralph unconsciously put into his warm welcoming grip. In\r\nturn Sim introduced each of his three chums, who were also given a\r\nsample of country cordiality, Tubby rubbing his fat hand for several\r\nminutes afterwards.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got the old one-horse shay handy here to carry you all up in,\r\nand your duffle ditto,” laughed Ralph, pointing to a rambling car\r\nthat looked capable of holding half a dozen passengers, and a\r\nquantity of stuff besides. “She isn’t to be wholly relied on for\r\nstability, because she rocks like a ship in a storm; but that engine\r\nis all right, for I look after it myself.”\r\n\r\nSo Rob understood that besides his many other good qualities Ralph\r\nJeffords must be something of a mechanic, which added to his\r\ninterest in the tall country lad. He made up his mind on the spot\r\nthat he was going to like Ralph; and more than ever determined he\r\nwould win him around to have a much higher opinion of scouts in\r\ngeneral, and those of the Eagle Patrol in particular, before he left\r\nWyoming for Long Island again.\r\n\r\nThey had managed to stow away their suitcases and overcoats, as well\r\nas what fishing tackle they had thought to fetch along in hopes of\r\nhaving some sport while up there in the mountains, when something\r\ncame to pass that for the moment made them forget all their various\r\nplans.\r\n\r\nTubby was just settling down in a corner of the rear seat, and\r\ntrying to get his feet clear of the traps that littered the bottom,\r\nwhen he suddenly threw out one of his hands and pointed excitedly,\r\nas he cried shrilly:\r\n\r\n“Oh! look, boys, look there at that horse acting crazy! One of the\r\ncinders from the engine must have fallen on his back and burned him.\r\nThere, he’s broke loose and is coming this way like a house afire!\r\nSomebody get hold of the reins and stop him!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Chapter II\r\n\r\n               “First Aid” Arouses Ralph’s Curiosity\r\n\r\n\r\nIt chanced that Ralph was the only one not already in the car, for\r\nhe had stepped around to give the crank a toss, and turn over the\r\nengine for making a start.\r\n\r\nAs a rule Rob Blake was very quick in his movements, but by the time\r\nhe had succeeded in getting his feet free from the various\r\nimpediments not yet properly stowed away, and jumped to the ground,\r\nthe lively country boy had actually sprung forward, seized the\r\nhorse’s bridle, and by throwing his whole weight on the lines\r\ndragged him to a standstill.\r\n\r\nIt was splendidly done, and Rob felt that had Ralph only been a\r\nwearer of the khaki he would, because of that act, have been a\r\ncandidate for a medal such as is given to scouts for saving human\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe boy who was in the vehicle had unfortunately stood up the better\r\nto pull at the reins, as he shrieked to the runaway animal to stop;\r\nwhen the sudden halt came he therefore lost his footing, and took a\r\nsevere header, landing on one shoulder, with his arm under him.\r\n\r\nRob shivered as he heard the crash, for he felt certain the poor\r\nchap would suffer some serious injury. Since Ralph seemed capable of\r\nmastering the excited horse, Rob turned toward the writhing boy on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n“Give Ralph a hand, Andy!” he called out energetically, accustomed\r\nto handling sudden emergencies, and never for an instant losing his\r\nhead. “You come with me, Sim. This boy has been badly hurt, I’m\r\nafraid.”\r\n\r\nThe little fellow was groaning terribly as they reached his side,\r\nand trying unsuccessfully to move himself.\r\n\r\n“Oh! it’s broken! it’s broken! What will daddy say?” he kept\r\nmoaning.\r\n\r\nSim saw that his face was ashen white, showing that he must be\r\nsuffering great anguish. Rob immediately but gently turned him over.\r\nHis right arm sagged in a suspicious manner and told the story.\r\n\r\n“Is it as bad as that, Rob?” asked Sim, in genuine pity for the poor\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\nAlready the patrol leader was hastily examining, but it did not take\r\nhim long to understand what had happened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The patrol leader was hastily examining the little\r\nfellow’s arm.]\r\n\r\n“Yes, he’s fractured both bones in the lower arm; but in a fairly\r\ndecent place between the elbow and wrist. Some one must run for a\r\ndoctor in a hurry.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go,” said Ralph who had by now joined them, leaving Andy to\r\nfasten the still quivering horse to a hitching post; “because I know\r\njust where to find Doc Slimmons. Besides, I can get there quicker by\r\nusing the car.”\r\n\r\nHe jumped over and quickly had the engine humming like mad.\r\nMeanwhile, Tubby had managed to land, and when the car shot away\r\nRalph was the only occupant.\r\n\r\nLuckily enough, he actually met the doctor in his own little touring\r\ncar, so that he was back again before five minutes had passed. By\r\nthat time quite a crowd had gathered. Sim and Andy and Tubby were\r\nemployed in forcing the people to keep back, and this they did all\r\nthe better because they had long been accustomed to handling excited\r\ncrowds consumed either by a morbid curiosity, or by fear as in the\r\ncase of a panic.\r\n\r\nDoctor Slimmons asked a few questions. He seemed to be impressed\r\nwith the fact that Rob had known just how to act.\r\n\r\n“You say that his left shoulder was also out of place, and that you\r\npulled the bone into the socket again, my boy? Good for you. That\r\nwas the wisest thing to be done under the circumstances. I believe\r\nnow that if there was no doctor within reach you would have known\r\njust how to go about handling this broken arm. You see, I happen to\r\nbe acquainted with some of the doings of you scouts, because I\r\nserved as scout master to a troop in Albany before coming up here to\r\ntake a practice.”\r\n\r\n“We have done such things before, Doctor,” said Rob, modestly, “and\r\nwith a fair measure of success. This poor boy is suffering terribly,\r\nand I hope you get him home soon.”\r\n\r\n“Would you like to use my car for the job, Doctor?” asked Ralph, who\r\nhad listened to what was said with a question in his eyes, though he\r\nknew that was no time to ask what was in his mind.\r\n\r\n“No, if you will assist me in getting him in my car, I can manage\r\nvery well; thank you just the same, Ralph. So you stopped the\r\nrunaway horse, did you; well, it was just what I would have expected\r\nfrom you. Let me say it would give me a great deal of satisfaction\r\npersonally if khaki suits were more commonly seen on the streets of\r\nWyoming, where there seems to be a queer feeling against the\r\nmovement. There, lift gently, boys; now hold him until I can get in\r\nand fix him comfortably. I’ve given him something to keep him from\r\nfainting, and to deaden the pain as well. Before a great while I’ll\r\nhave the arm set in plaster. Thank you all for your assistance,” and\r\nwith that he started off, not with a rush, but in a way calculated\r\nto save his young patient as much shock as possible.\r\n\r\n“Well, that was a sudden affair, all told,” remarked Tubby, who had\r\nbeen greatly exercised because of the white face of the injured boy,\r\nsince he could understand what agony of mind and body the victim\r\nmust be suffering. “Shall we leave the horse and vehicle here,\r\nRalph?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! sure,” the other replied; “the boy’s father will come and claim\r\nhis property. I only hope he doesn’t blame the kid, because it\r\nreally wasn’t his fault. I reckon a red-hot cinder must have fallen\r\non his back, and stuck there. What was that I heard the Doctor say\r\nabout you setting the cub’s left arm that had been dislocated--was\r\nthat a fact?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes, but that was a simple job,” remarked Rob, smiling at the\r\ndecided interest the other seemed to show in the incident.\r\n\r\n“We’ve got a heap more important things to our credit than that, let\r\nme tell you, Ralph,” Sim hastened to boast, when he saw the scout\r\nleader shaking his head at him, as though to beg him not to “blow\r\nhis own horn,” but to leave the other find out these interesting\r\nthings for himself.\r\n\r\n“Well, suppose we try for a start again,” suggested the chauffeur;\r\n“get settled in your places, boys, while I give the crank a turn.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder,” whispered Tubby to Rob, who chanced to sit next him,\r\nwith Andy filling the back seat, and Sim in front alongside the\r\ndriver, “I wonder if he begins to think scouts _can_ be worth a\r\npinch of salt, after all, Rob? You know that was one thing he wrote\r\nin a letter?”\r\n\r\n“Keep quiet,” advised the other, also in a whisper, “and perhaps a\r\nchance will crop up to show him the value of scout education. I’ve\r\ngot a hunch we’re due to open some people’s eyes up here. I hope it\r\nturns out that way. Even that young doctor said they were a\r\nnarrow-minded lot, you remember, who had a queer antipathy against\r\nscouts and their doings.”\r\n\r\n“Huh! given half a chance and we’ll soon show ’em,” grunted Tubby,\r\nbelligerently; and when the fat boy screwed up his features into\r\nwhat he was pleased to term his “fighting face” he certainly did\r\nlook awe-inspiring, indeed.\r\n\r\nThey were soon on their way, passing out of the town, and striking a\r\nfair road that took them into the country. Ralph, as they went\r\nalong, pointed out a number of interesting features connected with\r\nthe landscape, chief of which was the high peak in the distance that\r\nhe called Thundertop.\r\n\r\n“They still get bear up in that country,” he remarked, with kindling\r\neyes that told of the sportsman spirit possessing him, “and deer are\r\noften seen. Fact is, at this season of the year they seem tame, and\r\ndo heaps of damage to some of our crops. But since getting\r\ninterested in my fur farm I’ve given up hunting.”\r\n\r\n“Same way with us,” Sim hastened to say; “only now we do our hunting\r\nwith a camera instead of a gun. I know fellows who used to be just\r\nsavage to kill game, but who, nowadays, would ten times rather aim\r\nto snap off pictures, showing all sorts of wild animals in their\r\nnative haunts.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard about that stunt,” admitted Ralph, “but never met any\r\none who had done much at it. I hope you’ve thought to fetch some\r\npictures along with you, Sim; it would sure please me a heap to look\r\nthem over.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad to say I have a pack with me, some of which I captured\r\nmyself, while other scouts grabbed the rest. I’ll take great\r\npleasure in exhibiting the set to you tonight, Cousin Ralph,” and\r\nthe speaker gave Rob a wicked little wink as he partly turned his\r\nhead, as though to call the attention of the patrol leader to the\r\ninterest the other was already showing in regard to some of their\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Rob was growing more deeply in earnest continually with\r\nregard to winning the good opinion of this fine fellow, who it\r\nseemed had for so long been laboring under such a misapprehension\r\nwith regard to the value of scout organization.\r\n\r\nLater on he learned that a troop had once been started in Wyoming,\r\nbut, unfortunately, the fellows who tried to play the part were not\r\nqualified to serve with credit, nor could they find the right kind\r\nof a scout master who would take an interest in his charges. The\r\nconsequence was that the troop went from bad to worse, and committed\r\nsuch depredations that in the end they had been dismissed from the\r\nservice, the wise men at Headquarters declining to have the name of\r\nthe organization brought into disrepute in such a scandalous\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\n“Our place is only about eight miles out of town,” Ralph proceeded\r\nto explain, as they continued to glide along at a rapid pace, though\r\nthe big roomy car certainly did “wobble” furiously, and the lurches\r\noccasionally made on bad pieces of the roadway tried Tubby’s\r\npatience severely, for his breath was knocked out of his body by the\r\n“jouncing.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I’m glad of that!” Tubby was heard to say. Tubby may have had\r\nthe supper hour in view when he uttered those words, rather than the\r\nrough bouncing he was experiencing.\r\n\r\n“You’ve come in time to see how we knock out some of the stumps in a\r\npiece of former woodland,” remarked the farm boy. “Dad’s doing some\r\nof his plowing with dynamite, just to get in practice for the fall,\r\nwhen he expects to turn over ten acres that way for an experiment\r\npatch. Yes, and I’ve got heaps and heaps to show you up at my\r\nhatchery and fur farm. I’m already glad you brought your friends\r\nalong, Sim. I’ve been hoping to meet some scouts for quite a while;\r\nbecause, you see, I want to find out in what way they’re different\r\nfrom other fellows.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! get that idea out of your head in the start, Ralph,” Rob told\r\nhim, seriously! “Scouts are always boys, just the same, and with a\r\npretty good dose of fun in them, as you’ll find. If we do have some\r\nways that are different from the fellows you happen to know around\r\nWyoming, I want you to find them out for yourself, because a scout\r\nshould never boast of anything he’s done.”\r\n\r\n“Every one of my chums,” chimed in Sim, proudly, “was just wild to\r\ncome along with me when they heard of the stunts you were doing up\r\nhere. They’re interested a heap in fur farming. I’ve heard Rob here\r\ntalking about it for two years back. You’ll be able to give us lots\r\nof valuable pointers, Ralph; not that any of us consider going into\r\nthe business as possible rivals.”\r\n\r\n“Shucks! you’re welcome to, if you see fit,” declared the other,\r\nindifferently. “The chances are ten to one against success, unless\r\nyou’ve got the right sort of temperament for the job, and, besides,\r\nknow all about foxes, and mink, and otter, and skunks. Fortunes can\r\nbe made, and fortunes lost in fur farming. It all depends on the way\r\nyou go about it. So far I’ve been pretty lucky, if I do say it\r\nmyself. Wait a bit until I can show you my plant, that’s all. Here\r\nwe are, now, at the entrance of the Jefford Farm.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Chapter III\r\n\r\n                        The Young Fur Farmer\r\n\r\n\r\n“Skunks!” repeated Tubby, with a gasp of surprise, “do you really\r\nmean to tell me you’re raising a colony of those horrible critters\r\naround here, Ralph,” and at that he commenced to sniff the pure\r\natmosphere most suspiciously, in a manner to make some of the others\r\nlaugh uproarously.\r\n\r\n“Wait and see later on,” was all the information Ralph Jeffords\r\nwould offer, as they turned in through an open gateway, and motored\r\nup a winding drive that led to the rambling farmhouse.\r\n\r\nThe boys were immediately impressed with the air of neatness that\r\nseemed to be a leading feature at the Jeffords farm. Evidently, the\r\nfarmer was not only a man of considerable means, but he also liked\r\nto surround himself with conveniences such as few dwellers in this\r\nAdirondack wilderness could afford to possess. Running water,\r\nelectricity generated by his own plant, gas made at home, and a\r\ndozen other like comforts attested to his good sense.\r\n\r\n“You see, my father had to come up here to live long ago,” explained\r\nRalph, when he heard the others express their surprise concerning\r\nthese things so unusual in a district removed from town, “and as he\r\ngrew to love the place more and more, he kept installing these\r\nconveniences, until now we are fairly comfortable.”\r\n\r\nTubby felt sure he would like the whole outing first-rate. He even\r\nsniffed the air again vigorously, this time because of a delightful\r\naroma of cooking that was borne from the kitchen end of the big\r\nfarmhouse; for as everybody knew Tubby Hopkins was--well he himself\r\ncalled it a “connoisseur” when it came to the subject of providing\r\nfor the wants of boyish appetites.\r\n\r\nAt the door a tall gentleman was waiting to receive them. He, of\r\ncourse, was the father of Ralph, a sunburned man of rugged build,\r\nwho looked as though he enjoyed the best of health, thanks to his\r\noutdoor life; and yet many years before he had come up to this\r\nregion expecting to make a last fight against insidious disease.\r\n\r\n“Glad to know you all, boys,” he told them, shaking hands cordially,\r\nwhile his eyes glistened with pleasure, for it was not often Ralph\r\nhad friends visit him, he being a rather peculiar boy and much given\r\nto keeping his own company.\r\n\r\nSupper was soon ready, and although the boys had felt a bit tired\r\nafter a day on the train, they were speedily revived once they sat\r\ndown to a table that seemed fairly to _groan_ under the weight of\r\ngood things.\r\n\r\nTubby actually slyly pinched himself once or twice as he looked at\r\nthe wonderful spread, for he feared he was dreaming. Tubby was\r\nalready certain he would like the Jeffords farm very much--all but\r\nthose skunks, and somehow that worried him. He had had a former\r\nexperience with similar little animals that had given him great\r\ntrouble, and caused him to be shunned by every boy in camp during\r\nthe rest of their stay in the woods.\r\n\r\n“Huh! once stung, twice shy,” was the way Tubby put it when he\r\nallowed his mind to travel back again to those sorrowful days of the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nAfterwards they gathered in the big living-room, where the\r\nconversation became general. Rob had warned his chums not to attempt\r\nto boast of anything they had seen or done in their capacity as\r\nscouts; but when actually questioned they were at liberty to reply\r\nat length.\r\n\r\nThus a number of events came to be mentioned, and it could be seen\r\nthat both Ralph and his father had their interest aroused. In good\r\ntime, just as Sim anticipated, the subject of photography was\r\nbrought forward.\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes, Sim!” exclaimed Ralph, suddenly, “you promised to let me\r\ntake a look at a bunch of pictures you and some of the other fellows\r\ntook--I think you said they were of wild animals you had met in the\r\nwoods. Would you mind getting them now, while we have time?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be only too glad to do it, Ralph,” came the ready reply.\r\n“While I’m about it, Rob, I might as well fetch the little package\r\nof war scenes you fellows managed to snap off over in Belgium and\r\nFrance when you were there; also of the Panama-Pacific Exposition at\r\nSan Francisco.”\r\n\r\nRalph looked doubly eager on hearing this.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to tell me, Rob, that you’ve been across the sea, and\r\nactually in the fighting zone where the Germans and the French and\r\nBritish are scrapping to beat the band?” was what he flashed out.\r\n\r\n“We had that great good fortune,” replied the leader of the Eagle\r\nPatrol, modestly; “and saw a lot of things we’ll never forget to our\r\ndying day. I’ll tell you more about them while you’re looking over\r\nour little collection. They’re not the best pictures we’ve ever\r\ntaken, because you know we had only a tiny vest pocket edition of a\r\ncamera, and had to snap most of them off on the sly, for we would\r\nhave been arrested if caught doing it openly. I see you have a fine\r\nreading glass here on the table, and with that you can get a lot of\r\ngood detail work.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I begin to see that I’m going to get real enjoyment out of\r\nthis visit you and your chums are paying me, Sim,” acknowledged\r\nRalph, frankly.\r\n\r\nWhen later on the pictures were being examined in detail, and there\r\nwas always some story connected with every one, he repeated this\r\nexpression a dozen times. Sim or one of the others had a lively yarn\r\nto tell of many of the animal pictures--how Mr. Coon, for instance,\r\nwas induced to snap off his own likeness while in the act of\r\nstealing a tempting bait, a cord causing the trap to spring, and the\r\nflashlight to flame up, considerably astonishing the invader; also\r\nlittle adventures of their own while stumbling along through the\r\ndarkness to set a snare for some wary old fox that would never come\r\nnear the camp.\r\n\r\nRalph enjoyed these reminiscences hugely. They were quite in line\r\nwith his own fads, and more than once he exchanged glances with his\r\nfather as though to admit that possibly more enjoyment could be had\r\nin hunting with a camera than while “toting” a murderous shotgun\r\nthrough the woods in order to kill off the innocent little beasts\r\nand birds that dwelt there.\r\n\r\nThen, when the war pictures were being shown, how eagerly did he ask\r\ndozens of questions, for every boy has it in him to yearn to see\r\nmilitary manœuvres, perhaps a battle royal; though after passing\r\nthrough one such experience his ideas are apt to change radically.\r\n\r\nRob was able to give quite graphic descriptions of numerous\r\nthrilling things he and his chums had witnessed, yes, and even\r\nparticipated in. He told these modestly enough, as though it was\r\nonly a matter of course that scouts should lend a helping hand, and\r\nto assist field hospital surgeons take care of desperately wounded\r\nmen of both sides who were being brought in by streams.\r\n\r\nAt another time Ralph might have felt considerable doubt regarding\r\nthe authenticity of these accounts. Somehow, after witnessing the\r\nprompt manner in which Rob had taken care of that unlucky boy thrown\r\nfrom the vehicle, and suffering not only a broken arm but a\r\ndislocated shoulder as well, it seemed only natural that a wideawake\r\nyoung chap, such as he realized the scout leader to be, should prove\r\nequal to even greater emergencies.\r\n\r\nLong and earnestly did he scan those small pictures that in many\r\nways revealed the fact that Rob had indeed been in the war zone,\r\nclose to where terrible battles were being daily fought to prove\r\nwhether the ideals of the Teuton or those of the Allies were to\r\nprevail from that time forth in the world.\r\n\r\nFinally, Rob grew tired of talking. He turned the tables by starting\r\nRalph into telling some things connected with his unique enterprise\r\nof fur farming. Once this subject came to the front and the farm boy\r\nwas all animation, for it could be easily seen that his heart was in\r\nhis peculiar profession.\r\n\r\n“I’d always had ideas on the subject,” he went on to say, “but only\r\na couple of years ago commenced to put them into practical\r\noperation. Dad gave me a hundred of his wildest acres that could\r\nnever be used for anything else, and we had the tract fenced in,\r\neven going down several feet so as to keep my foxes from ever\r\ndigging a burrow, and escaping in that way.”\r\n\r\n“Did you catch or buy your first pair of blacks?” asked Rob.\r\n\r\n“Well, as there hasn’t been a wild black fox seen around this\r\nneighborhood for twenty years and more, though plenty of common red\r\nones,” Ralph explained, “we had to invest some big money for the\r\nfirst pair. But they had a litter of pups, and it happened that the\r\nlittle chaps came true to color, all right, though they sometimes\r\nrevert back to the old stock, you know. So we got started, and by\r\ntrading, selling, and buying I now have just sixteen foxes in my\r\npen, some young, and others ready to donate their pelts this Fall,\r\nif the market quotations hold up.”\r\n\r\n“About what price do you call a good one?” asked Sim.\r\n\r\n“Oh! all the way from five hundred up to fifteen hundred dollars,”\r\nsaid Ralph in the most unconcerned way possible; at which Tubby’s\r\neyes widened, and he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Gingersnaps and popguns! but you surely don’t mean that amount of\r\nmoney for just one little black fox skin, Ralph?”\r\n\r\n“Why, certainly,” the other assured him, smiling at Tubby’s\r\namazement. “There have been extra fine ones that brought as much as\r\nthree thousand dollars. I never expect to raise such expensive\r\nstock. I’m counting on five hundred as the basis of my calculations;\r\nand if you’re fairly successful in raising your litters, there’s\r\ngood money in the business at that. Besides, it’s great sport in the\r\nbargain to one who really loves animals, and knows more or less of\r\ntheir cute ways.”\r\n\r\n“Five hundred dollars for just one little skin!” Tubby was heard to\r\nmutter, as though that struck him as most remarkable. “Well, if you\r\nkeep along as you’re going, Ralph, I can see you getting to be a\r\nsecond Rockefeller before you’re fifty. Now, I don’t suppose a skunk\r\nis quite as valuable an article, though the fellow brave enough to\r\nhandle him deserves a fortune, according to my notion.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” laughed the other, “we’re glad to get from one to three\r\ndollars for a skunk pelt, according to whether it’s jet black, or\r\nstriped. Most of them are striped, you know. But wait and you’ll\r\nlearn more about these things later on.”\r\n\r\n“Then it’ll have to be at considerable distance for me, I guess,”\r\naffirmed Tubby, with a look of resolution on his broad face, and a\r\ndetermined shake of his head.\r\n\r\nUpon being encouraged to narrate some of his interesting experiences\r\nwhile engaged in his odd calling, Ralph gladly complied. The scouts\r\nshowed deep curiosity as they plied him with questions. Evidently\r\nthere was a good chance for a fair exchange of notes, and it looked\r\nas though both sides would be all the richer for this barter.\r\n\r\nIt was found that an extra large room had been set aside for the\r\nboys, with two generous double beds in it. There were four windows,\r\nso they were sure to have an abundance of fresh air while up at the\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nWhen retiring for the night, at about ten o’clock, amidst sundry\r\nyawns, and more or less stretching of arms, the quartette from\r\nHampton seemed to agree on one particular thing. This was to the\r\neffect that their stay in the mountains promised to be one of the\r\nmost interesting and entertaining of all their experiences. There\r\nwere so many new things for them to see, and the environments seemed\r\nso particularly home-like-with royal fare thrown in, Tubby wanted\r\nthem to remember as they gave thanks--that a feast awaited them.\r\n\r\nSome of them wished they had come for a month instead of just one\r\nweek. But the vacation season was nearing an end, and they had\r\ncertain duties and engagements around Hampton that could not be\r\nlonger deferred.\r\n\r\nSo they finally climbed aboard their several big beds, and Tubby\r\ntried to get the wonderful things he had been hearing out of his\r\nmind, so he could go to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Chapter IV\r\n\r\n                         The Black Fox Pen\r\n\r\n\r\nA grand morning awaited the four boys as they hurriedly dressed, and\r\nthen stepped outdoors. Ralph was already afoot, as he had a few\r\nchores to be attended to at the nearby barns, where the grunting of\r\nfat hogs and squealing of smaller pigs, the lowing of fancy cattle\r\nthat gave the rich cream they had enjoyed the night before at\r\nsupper, as well as horses, sheep, and even some high-priced goats\r\ntold how Mr. Jeffords took his country pleasures.\r\n\r\nThen there was a series of houses and yards devoted to poultry,\r\nmostly of the Rhode Island Red and White Leghorn varieties. Just\r\nbeyond the boys were delighted to find a pen of beautiful imported\r\npheasants with magnificent plumage of almost every color of the\r\nrainbow.\r\n\r\n“But try as we would,” confessed Ralph, “we’ve never been very\r\nsuccessful in raising many of those birds. Father thinks they are\r\nnot suited to the climate, even up here in the mountains, where it\r\nnever gets as hot as down your way. You see, they flourish best in a\r\ncountry like England, where the winters are mild, and summers fairly\r\ndecent. So we just keep that stock for show purposes. Father lost\r\nmoney in his investment; but it taught us both a lesson. We go in\r\nnow for the best native stock of all sorts.”\r\n\r\nBreakfast even raised the good opinion Tubby already entertained\r\ntoward the woman who did the cooking. When he found that she was a\r\ngenuine Southern “mammy,” for the Jeffords originally used to be\r\nslave-owners down in South Carolina, he could understand how she\r\nmade such jolly cornbread, and why they had hominy on the table\r\nevery morning of their stay.\r\n\r\nNow they had the first day before them, and there would be much to\r\ninterest them.\r\n\r\n“First thing you want to watch,” Ralph went on to say as they still\r\nsat around the table, though no one could eat another mouthful of\r\nfood, “is the way we smash our big stumps up here. It’s always well\r\nworth seeing to a novice, though long ago we became so accustomed of\r\nharnessing dynamite, and making it do our work for us, that we take\r\nthings as a matter of course.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said Andy Bowles, reflectively, “it’s just like folks\r\nwho have electricity, and use it for cooking, ironing, making toast,\r\nheating water in a hurry, and a thousand-and-one other things; so\r\nbefore long they look on it as a servant in the house, always to be\r\nstarted working by the touch of a button.”\r\n\r\nOnce outside and the boys were led to a distant part of the farm,\r\nwhere the wood lot still remained. Here several men were busily\r\nengaged in blasting out stumps of trees that had previously been cut\r\ndown, and carted away in one shape or other.\r\n\r\nThe dynamite cartridge was placed properly, being connected by a\r\nwire with a battery at some little distance away. Then at a signal\r\nthe operator made his connection, there would follow a sharp report\r\nquite different from a powder explosion or the roar of big guns over\r\non the battle lines in Europe. After that the stump would be lifted\r\nbodily from its lodgings and could be carted away, either whole or,\r\nas usually happened, in fragments.\r\n\r\nRob was particularly interested in the operation. He examined\r\neverything connected with the simple apparatus, and asked a number\r\nof questions concerning the outfit. No one dreamed how valuable the\r\ninformation he thus received was going to prove before a great time\r\nhad elapsed.\r\n\r\n“Of course, if you are doing all these stunts with dynamite, Ralph,”\r\nhe finally remarked, “you must keep quite a stock of the explosive\r\non hand all the time?”\r\n\r\n“We have to,” he was told, without hesitation. “It is kept locked up\r\nin that little stone house we passed coming up here, and father\r\nhimself doles out the day’s supply. The stuff is a little too\r\ndangerous, and costly, too, to be left around loose.”\r\n\r\n“I should say so,” admitted Tubby, who had listened to all this talk\r\nwith interest, though never for a minute dreaming that it would\r\nenter into any affair in which they would be connected.\r\n\r\n“You see,” continued Ralph, always willing to supply information,\r\n“we have it so arranged that we can carry several cartridges, as\r\nwell as the coil of wire and the battery, on this little hand-cart\r\nthat one man can push. So we can go to any part of the farm. Once we\r\ndrove twenty miles with the outfit to clear up a tract for a\r\ngentleman who had never seen stumps blown to pieces in this way.”\r\n\r\nRob thought that was a clever idea. He impressed it upon his mind,\r\nthough had he been asked why he did this he might have found it\r\ndifficult to answer, except to say that he always liked to store\r\nsuch interesting facts away for future reference.\r\n\r\n“How about that plowing with dynamite?” asked Sim. “Will Uncle Simon\r\nbe doing any of that today, do you expect, Ralph?”\r\n\r\n“I hardly think so,” the other replied. “It was laid out for\r\ntomorrow, and one gang working along those lines is enough at a\r\ntime. The next thing on the morning’s programme is a visit to my fur\r\nfarm. Are you feeling fit for a little walk?”\r\n\r\n“We’re crazy to be on the jump,” affirmed Sim. “You must know that\r\nscouts hike a great deal, which is one thing that makes for their\r\ngood health. Even Tubby here is pretty good at tramping, though you\r\nwouldn’t think it to look at his build. He has plenty of grit, and\r\nwill stick everlastingly to anything he attempts, even if laboring\r\nunder a handicap that none of the rest of us have to stand.”\r\n\r\nTubby had to bow to Sim after this compliment.\r\n\r\n“Oh! I’ve got plenty of grit,” he admitted, “but there are times\r\nwhen I puff and blow terribly. That can’t be helped, you know. I’m\r\nbuilt on such a generous order that I have to carry a heap more\r\nweight than most fellows.”\r\n\r\nPresently they started forth, chattering like magpies as they walked\r\nalong. The section of the big farm given over to Ralph’s experiment\r\nin fur raising was quite some distance from the house, being an\r\nangle where the primeval woods covered most of the “soil,” which, by\r\nthe way, happened to be pretty much rock.\r\n\r\nOn the road they came across a pond where there were rushes, and\r\nplenty of frog-spawn floating on the water. Tubby became interested\r\nat once.\r\n\r\n“Oh! listen to the bass chorus, will you?” he ejaculated. “Why,\r\nthere must be a dozen huskies keeping time if there’s one. Oh! see\r\nthat monster on the bank! Say, I can count three more big greenbacks\r\nsunning themselves on the mud near the edge of the water. Whew! but\r\nit makes my mouth water just to think of the _delicious_ messes a\r\nfellow can pick up here any old day.”\r\n\r\nRalph laughed good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n“Then consider yourself appointed official frog hunter for the\r\ncrowd,” he told Tubby, whose eyes glistened at hearing the joyous\r\nnews. “You can have just as many as you want to eat while up here.\r\nSomehow, I don’t seem to care much for frogs’ legs myself, nor does\r\ndad. When we hanker after chicken we get chicken, and if it’s fish\r\nwe want, we go out for trout or bass; but the combination doesn’t\r\nappeal to us.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you a dozen times, Ralph, for giving me the promise of a\r\nsmashing good feast. I’m abnormally fond of them. When you ship a\r\nbatch of frogs’ legs down to New York markets, how do you go after\r\nthem? They jump so swift that it’s always hard for me to corral any.\r\nAt home I use a short pole with two feet of line, and a red fly at\r\nthe end, pushing close enough to dangle the said fly before the nose\r\nof Mr. Frog, who grabs it in a hurry.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! we don’t bother with all that fuss up here,” explained Ralph.\r\n“I have a little Flobert rifle that I knock ’em over with. You could\r\nget a hundred in a morning without much trouble. I’ll lend it to you\r\nany time you want, Tubby.”\r\n\r\nThat completed the delight of the fat boy, who, in imagination,\r\nalready saw himself feasting on his favorite dish to his heart’s\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\n“It’s going to be lots of fun for Tubby,” remarked Andy,\r\nquizzically, “but all the same it’s bound to be death to the frogs.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what good are the slippery things, except to serve as food\r\nfor people, I’d like to know? As singers they’re a miserable\r\nfailure, and all their lives, from the time they’re tadpoles up to\r\nwhen they weigh two solid pounds, they never do any particular good\r\ntill they are served on the table, browned to a crisp, and making\r\nhonest boys’ hearts send up their thanksgiving.”\r\n\r\n“No use trying to convince Tubby about the sin of sacrificing things\r\nto satisfy his appetite,” laughed Rob. “He’s committed to the idea\r\nthat everything was put on this earth for one great purpose, which\r\nwas to cater to the wants of man.”\r\n\r\n“Well, isn’t getting good and hungry one of man’s greatest\r\ntroubles?” Tubby immediately demanded, triumphantly. “Hasn’t he been\r\ngiven dominion over all the fowls of the air, the fishes of the\r\nwaters, and the animals that populate the woods in order to sustain\r\nhis life? That’s my way of looking at it, so there you are.”\r\n\r\nAs usual, Tubby’s argument was unanswerable, and as they left the\r\nnoisy frog pond in the rear, the fat boy cast a happy glance back at\r\nthe watery stretch, as though anticipating royal good times around\r\nthat vicinity later on.\r\n\r\nAfter a while they came to a wilder stretch of country. Rob knew\r\nthen that the fur farm was close at hand, and presently they caught\r\nglimpses of the high fence surrounding the tract given over to this\r\nunique enterprise.\r\n\r\n“I wanted to ask if you ever had any of your foxes stolen, Ralph?”\r\nSim was inquiring as they pushed on. “When a single black fox pelt\r\nis worth hundreds of dollars, it strikes me that some unscrupulous\r\nmen might scheme to sneak in on you and try to clean out your farm.”\r\n\r\n“Well, they couldn’t do that, because the foxes are mighty cunning,”\r\nthe proprietor explained. “They would have to set traps, and come\r\nand go. I’ve figured all that out, and taken proper precautions\r\nagainst losing any of my prizes. One of the men stays up here day\r\nand night, and I often join him. He has a cabin inside the\r\nenclosure; and, besides, we have a way of detecting it if any\r\nintruder should try to climb the fence. Electricity is a great\r\nagent, you know, Sim.”\r\n\r\nHe did not take the trouble to explain further, so the boys could\r\nonly guess what he meant. Rob believed that there must be a wire\r\nrunning along the top of the fence, and that every night an electric\r\ncurrent was turned on, after the manner in which empty dwelling\r\nhouses are protected in big cities by a firm that guarantees against\r\ntheir being entered and robbed during the absence of the owners.\r\n\r\nIf this were so, it would mean that Ralph was clever, and\r\nup-to-date. Rob found himself admiring the other more than ever. He\r\nalso meant to win Ralph over to a new way of looking at scout\r\nactivities before they departed from that region. Such a wideawake\r\nand enterprising boy certainly should be enrolled in the ranks where\r\nhis influence would be for the upbuilding of other fellows’\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIn other words, Rob believed that Wyoming was horribly behind the\r\ntimes in not encouraging a regular scout troop; and he hoped that\r\nthis fault could be remedied before a great while, to the betterment\r\nof the community and every growing lad around Wyoming. Because an\r\nirresponsible group of fellows had once organized and tried to carry\r\nout the ideas of the Boy Scouts without any real authorization from\r\nHeadquarters was no reason the experiment should not be tried again,\r\nthis time starting from the right base.\r\n\r\nOnce inside the enclosure, they found many things to interest them.\r\nTubby expressed himself wild to set eyes on a genuine black fox. He\r\nhad often seen the common red variety, but something that was\r\nespecially valuable appealed to his curiosity.\r\n\r\nSo, to oblige him, Ralph uttered a little call that, after being\r\nrepeated several times, brought a response. They could see a\r\ndark-colored object creeping toward them, but it would not come very\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n“Usually Timmy will come up and eat food out of my hand,” said\r\nRalph; “but, like all his breed, he’s a timid little duck, and\r\ndoesn’t take to strangers. So that’s about all you’ll see of him\r\ntoday.”\r\n\r\nAt the first movement one of them made the fox vanished like a\r\nstreak.\r\n\r\n“He’s lit out,” said Tubby, in a disappointed tone. “I’m sorry, too,\r\nbecause I’d like to say I’d petted a black fox. But, Ralph, between\r\nus, he looked sort of silver-colored, you know?”\r\n\r\n“Some people call them silver foxes,” the grower of fine fur\r\nexplained. “In some lights they do look silver gray, and then again\r\ndense black. But their fur is the silkiest known, which is one\r\nreason it commands such a big price; it isn’t coarse like that of\r\nother foxes. You know the difference between a common cart animal\r\nand a thoroughbred Kentucky race horse; well, and black fox is of\r\nthat racer breed.”\r\n\r\nThey naturally talked more or less of the chances of such an\r\nenterprise succeeding, and Ralph learned that Rob Blake was pretty\r\nwell posted about all such things.\r\n\r\n“We are taking a chance, you understand,” he remarked, after Rob had\r\nasked several questions, “but we think we are on the way to making\r\nthe venture a profitable one. Like everything else that deserves\r\nsuccess, you have to work like a beaver, and put your whole soul\r\ninto it, day and night. It’s eternal vigilance in raising fur,\r\nbecause we have all sorts of enemies to fight against.”\r\n\r\n“Enemies?” repeated Tubby. “What do you mean by that, Ralph?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! some disease may get into your pen, just as sometimes happens\r\nto chicken fanciers, and cleans them out. Foxes are liable to\r\ndisease, and also to insect pests that make the fur less valuable.\r\nThen eagles and hawks are always ready to pick up a fat young fox if\r\nthey get a chance, not to speak of raiding wildcats. My man always\r\ncarried a gun with him when making his rounds.”\r\n\r\n“And has he often had to use it to protect your fox litters?” asked\r\nTubby.\r\n\r\n“We’ve killed quite a few birds that meant to rob me of the profits\r\nof my labor,” Ralph answered, “and one wildcat was shot close to\r\nthis place; but so far as I know up to now I haven’t lost a single\r\npelt. We count our animals every day at feeding time. I’ll fix it\r\nlater on so you can see the whole pen at once by staying hidden in a\r\ntree while we call them around. Now let’s move along, because you\r\nwill want to see my other pens containing the mink, otter, and\r\nskunks.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Chapter V\r\n\r\n                        An Uninvited Visitor\r\n\r\n\r\n“You’ll excuse me, boys,” observed Tubby, naively, “if I stop to tie\r\nmy shoe lace. I’ll catch up with you right away, or hang on to your\r\nwake, which will answer just as well.”\r\n\r\nSim chuckled as though amused.\r\n\r\n“Bless his heart,” he remarked to Ralph, who had not exactly\r\nunderstood, “Tubby has a natural prejudice against skunks. It was\r\nhonestly earned, too.”\r\n\r\nThen he rapidly went on to sketch the adventure that had taken place\r\nonce upon a time when Tubby was green to the woods, telling how the\r\nother upon running across a skunk for the first time thought it a\r\n“cute” little animal just such as he wanted for a camp pet; and\r\nafter trying to get it in a corner so as to pounce on it, Tubby\r\nwished he hadn’t--also how he was banished from active participation\r\nin the delightful times they had later on simply because the other\r\nfellows refused to associate with him.\r\n\r\nAll this amused Ralph greatly.\r\n\r\n“Well, I admit that it’s mighty dangerous for any one to bother with\r\nskunks, for they are timid animals, and mistrust every one they\r\ndon’t know,” he stated. “I move around among them without any\r\ntrouble. They feed from my hand, and I’ve taken up several of them\r\njust as you would a tabby at home. I admit that eternal vigilance is\r\nthe price of safety when near them. You must be on the alert\r\ncontinually, and never do anything to startle them.”\r\n\r\n“Well, a bee man near our town told me bees were handled along the\r\nsame lines,” Andy Bowles added. “Those who handle the frames full of\r\nhoneycomb, and swarming with bees must be cool chaps. Smoking helps\r\nsome, for bees seem to think the hive is in danger, and begin to\r\nload up with honey right away. It seems that when a bee is carrying\r\nall the honey it can stagger under it isn’t liable to get busy with\r\nits sting.”\r\n\r\nThey now arrived at the part of the big enclosure given over to the\r\nstriped animals with the bushy tails and the small heads. Tubby\r\nstayed far back, and kept on the anxious seat all the time. No\r\ninducement could tempt him to join the others.\r\n\r\n“I’m not immune, if you fellows are,” he called out, when they tried\r\nto coax him along. “I know when I’m well enough off, too, and some\r\npeople don’t seem to understand that fine point. Don’t bother with\r\nme, boys; go ahead and investigate; but I hope you’ll be wise enough\r\nto let Ralph do all the handling of his pets. Ugh!”\r\n\r\nSo they left Tubby there to await their return. Ralph showed them\r\nthrough the skunk preserve, explaining many things connected with\r\nthe curing of skins so that they would have a marketable value.\r\n\r\n“You see, there’s getting to be a shorter crop of the best skins\r\nevery year to meet a growing demand,” he proceeded, after the manner\r\nof one who had the points at his fingers’ ends from constant study.\r\n“That means commoner pelts have to take the place of those that are\r\nfalling off. Many of these are muskrat and skunk skins, and even the\r\ncommon house tabby is called on to help tide over the shortage. What\r\nwith a skillful use of dyes, and even the sewing of white hairs in\r\nblack skins, they manage to deceive the public.”\r\n\r\nHe showed them how he could feed some of his queer pets. Tubby at a\r\ndistance was holding his hands together, and looking very much\r\ndistressed when he saw a dozen of the striped animals all around\r\nRalph, and acting like chickens on the farm when grain was being\r\nthrown to them.\r\n\r\nLater on, when the boys were thinking of turning away and continuing\r\ntheir investigations further, they heard a great outcry from near at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“Hey! Ralph, everybody come quick, and chase this skunk away! He’s\r\nbent on making up to me, and I can see from the way he looks that he\r\njust knows I’m a hater of his species. Oh! please hurry and save\r\nme!”\r\n\r\nLaughing at the frantic appeal in Tubby’s voice, they hastened\r\ntoward him, to find that the fat boy in desperation had actually\r\nclimbed a tree, while a very small specimen of the inmates of the\r\ncorral was moving about below, now and then looking upward, as if\r\nwondering why he was not given something to eat, as usual.\r\n\r\nThey rescued Tubby by Ralph coaxing the “terrible beast” to move\r\naway. Tubby looked red in the face, and also seemed to be a little\r\nashamed at having shown the white feather.\r\n\r\n“Well, I admit it was a bad case of rattles with me,” he said, with\r\na grimace; “but, then, there’s a reason. I’ve been there before, and\r\nI know that the smaller they are the more likely you may be to get\r\nthem angry. But all’s well that ends well. I’m glad you’re done with\r\nthis particular pen. Now show us your mink and otter, won’t you,\r\nRalph?”\r\n\r\n“I can show you where I keep them, and what I’ve done to induce them\r\nto feel at home and multiply,” replied the other, “but I doubt\r\nwhether we catch sight of a single member of the community. They are\r\nthat shy they seldom come out in the daytime. As to feeding them,\r\nall we have to do is to see that there are plenty of fish in the\r\nbrook that runs through the lot.”\r\n\r\n“But if that brook comes and goes, what’s to prevent your\r\nhigh-priced mink and otter from following it out?” inquired Andy,\r\nwho never liked to puzzle over anything unnecessarily when the\r\nanswer could be obtained simply by asking.\r\n\r\n“Oh! we’ve fixed that by a regular barred gate at either end,”\r\nexplained Ralph. “The water can escape, ditto very small fish; but\r\nwe keep larger ones stocked in the stream; and those fur-coated\r\nfishers can always get a mess.”\r\n\r\n“And I suppose,” suggested Rob, deeply interested, “that if you ever\r\ndo think they’ve increased in number, and you feel like taking your\r\ntoll of the bunch, you’ll have to set regular mink and otter traps\r\nin the water to catch them with?”\r\n\r\n“That’s what it’ll amount to,” admitted the other, “but understand\r\nthat I’m not building any great hopes of more than getting my money\r\nback on this mink and otter venture. I don’t believe any one has, so\r\nfar, been very successful raising them artificially. Some animals,\r\nyou know, will not breed in captivity. But I’m making the\r\nexperiment, and later on will let you know how it turns out.”\r\n\r\n“Show us how that water gate works, will you, Ralph?” suggested his\r\ncousin, who always liked to examine anything that excited his\r\ninterest--Tubby had also been that way once, but since a bitter\r\nexperience he had shown more commendable caution, and was ready to\r\ntake some things for granted.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, if you come this way with me,” the fur farmer replied.\r\n“Here’s the creek, you see, and in some of these little burrows\r\namong the rocks and in the earth the mink and otter lie in safety.\r\nRight now I warrant you more than one pair of bright eyes watches\r\nevery move we make, though you couldn’t discover the animal if you\r\nhad a field-glass along.”\r\n\r\nIn this fashion he continued to tell them many interesting things\r\nconnected with his study of wild animal life; some of which were new\r\neven to Rob, who had had an extended acquaintance with such subjects\r\nranging over a long experience. The subject was very fascinating to\r\nall of the scouts, even Tubby declaring that he was beginning to\r\ntake quite some stock in the study of small game animals, “all but\r\none kind that somehow don’t seem to appeal to me,” he went on to\r\nsay, whereupon, of course, Sim had to hastily remark:\r\n\r\n“Huh! some of the boys are still of the opinion that they _do_\r\nappeal to you pretty strongly, Tubby; but there, let it pass. I just\r\ncouldn’t help saying it, you know.”\r\n\r\nThey saw the tracks of the timid mink and otter along the edge of\r\nthe stream where they fished for their dinners daily, but did not\r\ncatch even a fleeting view of a member of the little fur colony.\r\n\r\nComing to the high fence among the trees, they found where the brook\r\npassed out. The “gate” mentioned by Ralph was a well-built one, made\r\nof stout lumber, and with iron bars close together, between which\r\nthe water could always pass, but no animal find either an exit or\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes, after a storm, we have to clear this grating,” Ralph\r\ntold them, “for it catches and holds all sorts of floating stuff,\r\nsuch as dead wood and the like. So far it seems to answer our\r\npurpose. Our last census of the inmates showed that they were all\r\nhere, and that there was a pair of whelps with one set of the\r\nmink--if that is what you call them, perhaps cubs, eh, Rob?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I hardly know how to answer that,” confessed the other. “If I\r\nwanted to speak of them, I’d likely say baby mink, or youngsters. It\r\nwould be a feather in your cap, Ralph, if you did succeed where so\r\nmany others have fallen down. I’m sure we all wish you the best luck\r\ngoing.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right!” declared Tubby, emphatically. “I admire pluck\r\nwherever I see it; and somebody has always got to be a pioneer in\r\nevery movement that succeeds over many failures.”\r\n\r\n“You see, the woods are pretty dense over in this section,”\r\nexplained the fur farmer, “and there’s always danger that some wild\r\nbeast may slip in here when Pete and myself are away, to make a haul\r\nof my property. It would be a hard blow if I came along here some\r\nday and found that my mink colony had been cleaned out.”\r\n\r\nAs though his words had been carried to hostile ears and aroused a\r\nstorm of protest, at that very moment there came a growl so savage\r\nthat it made Tubby tremble. He stared straight up into the tree from\r\nwhich the sound seemed to proceed, pointed a quivering finger, and\r\ngasped the one word:\r\n\r\n“Wildcat!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Chapter VI\r\n\r\n                     Peleg Pinder’s Heavy Load\r\n\r\n\r\n“Don’t move!”\r\n\r\nTubby knew that when Rob Blake spoke in that tense way he meant what\r\nhe said; so, although he felt an inclination to shrink back from\r\nthat terrible vision of an enraged bobcat, he managed to grit his\r\nteeth together and hold his ground.\r\n\r\nRalph, Sim and Andy took the admonition to heart as well as did the\r\nfat boy, for they seemed rooted to their tracks, all staring as hard\r\nas they could up into the lower branches of the tree just in front.\r\n\r\nThe cat could be plainly seen crouching there, with its ears\r\nflattened against its head, after the manner of all enraged felines.\r\nIt was a pretty “hefty” specimen of its kind, too, Rob saw, much\r\nlarger and more powerful than the ordinary cat.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, it “sensed” a feast beyond the boundary fence, and had\r\nstarted to pay a neighborly visit with dinner in mind when\r\ninterrupted by the approach of the five boys. Being accustomed to\r\nlording it over other animals in its native forests, the wildcat did\r\nnot fancy beating a retreat simply because some of those two-legged\r\ncreatures chose to cross its path.\r\n\r\nThat ominous growl was meant as a warning to them to beware how they\r\nincurred its animosity. From the way in which its haunches had\r\nsettled upon the limb, it appeared as though the beast might be in\r\nreadiness to make a leap; and it was because of this that Rob had\r\ninstantly hissed those words.\r\n\r\nAt the time it chanced he was just a little in the advance; hence\r\nhis position was more inclined to be a perilous one than could be\r\nsaid of his companions. None of them had any weapon handy with which\r\nto defend themselves in case the animal really attacked them; though\r\nSim and Andy immediately began to use their eyes to advantage in the\r\nhope of being able to see a club of some sort, always the first\r\nresort of a boy in trouble.\r\n\r\n“Tell us what to do, Rob!” urged Sim, who had actually discovered\r\nthe cudgel he wanted to possess, yet did not dare make a move toward\r\ngetting it in his grip lest by so doing he tempt the savage beast to\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n“Stand perfectly still!” ordered the patrol leader. “You can do more\r\ngood that way than by moving. If we all just stare at him, he’ll\r\nsoon get uneasy, not knowing what to make of such a mysterious\r\ncrowd. Animals hate to look into human eyes, they say. I’ve stared a\r\ndog out of countenance that way myself.”\r\n\r\n“Huh!” grunted Tubby, remembering how he had once tried that same\r\ngame himself with a barking puppy, getting down on his hands and\r\nknees to manage better, only to have the little varmint instantly\r\nseize hold of his nose and hang on.\r\n\r\n“How would it do for all to give a big yell together?” suggested\r\nRalph.\r\n\r\n“That might make him jump, I take it,” replied Andy Bowles, wishing\r\nhe had his bugle handy, for with it he could sound a shrill blast\r\nthat would surely cause the impudent cat to retreat in haste.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it would startle him, all right,” admitted Rob, “but he might\r\njump the wrong way, and at us. Better try my scheme; it can do no\r\nharm, and I don’t think he’ll attack us unless we begin the fight.”\r\n\r\n“I see a bully club close by my feet, Rob.”\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t bother trying to get hold of it just yet,” urged the\r\nother. “But if he should leap at me, see to it you grab that club in\r\na big hurry, and let him have it with a smack. Steady, now, you can\r\nsee the beast’s beginning to get uneasy right along.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you’re right, he is, Rob,” admitted Ralph, with a vein of\r\nrelief in his voice, for no fellow can entertain the idea of\r\nbattling bare-handed with a fierce four-footed adversary without\r\nshivering; and Ralph knew only too well how even a scratch from the\r\nclaws of a carnivorous animal may cause blood poisoning if not\r\nproperly treated in time.\r\n\r\nSo they all continued to stand there as nearly like statues as their\r\nvarious dispositions would allow, keeping up a battery of staring\r\nlooks that must have more or less bewildered the intruder.\r\n\r\nTubby heaved a great sigh. It was additionally hard on him, this\r\ntrying to keep absolutely still, lest by moving an attack be\r\nprecipitated, the end of which none of them could see.\r\n\r\n“Gee whiz! isn’t he ever going to skip out?” he groaned, feeling the\r\ndrops of perspiration gathering on his forehead, and running down\r\nhis stubby nose, yet being deprived of the satisfaction of taking\r\nout his red bandanna and wiping his streaming face as he would have\r\nliked.\r\n\r\n“Have a little more patience, Tubby,” pleaded Sim. “He’s getting\r\nready to vamoose the ranch, I tell you. There, didn’t you see how he\r\ntook a quick peek behind him? They say that in a fight the man who\r\nlooks back is the one who is getting whipped, because he’s thinking\r\nof beating it. Watch, now, and be ready to give him a parting whoop\r\nif he does jump over the fence again.”\r\n\r\nThe strange bobcat somehow found it unpleasant to remain there on\r\nprivate grounds, and with those five queer creatures facing him so\r\nmutely. They meant him harm, of that he must have concluded, and\r\nperhaps he had better postpone his intended feast on plump fox cubs\r\nor young mink. Night would be a better time for his hunting; and a\r\nretreat could not be called dishonorable when the enemy counted five\r\nagainst one.\r\n\r\nSo, finally, he made a quick backward jump that allowed of a new\r\nperch just over the dividing fence. This movement was the signal for\r\na sudden change of policy on the part of the boys, for they burst\r\ninto a series of loud shouts, and Sim instantly darted forward to\r\nsecure the coveted club.\r\n\r\nThe wildcat, having concluded to pull out and evidently not liking\r\nthose aggressive sounds, continued its flight, growling savagely as\r\nit went, and looking back once before finally disappearing amidst\r\nthe foliage of the trees beyond the high fence.\r\n\r\n“That was an adventure, sure enough!” exclaimed Sim, breathing hard\r\nafter his recent exertions. “Just to think of our running across\r\nsuch a tough customer when Ralph here was speaking about troublesome\r\npests. Do you reckon this was his first visit to your pens, Ralph?”\r\n\r\n“I hope and believe so,” the other replied, frowning at the same\r\ntime. “I would hate to learn that it had become a habit with him.\r\nBesides, we have seen no signs around to indicate that he’d ever\r\nbeen here before. But the rascal has scented my pets, and will give\r\nus no peace until he’s done for.”\r\n\r\n“I should say the same thing!” declared Rob. “It’s just like a wolf\r\nthat threatens a sheep-fold, there can be no safety until he’s been\r\npotted.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll see Pete at once,” continued the other, with a look of\r\ndetermination on his strong face, “and start him out with the dogs.\r\nIf they’re lucky they’ll get on the track of the beast before\r\nsundown and, I hope, knock him over.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation then was mostly of the woods, and Ralph as well as\r\nsome of the others mentioned a number of curious circumstances that\r\nhad come under their observation while camping out. Ralph had\r\nformerly been quite a hunter and trapper whenever he had an\r\nopportunity, though, as he confessed, latterly the sport seemed to\r\nbe palling upon him somewhat.\r\n\r\n“To tell the truth, Sim,” he said, as they strolled back toward the\r\ndistant farmhouse, after seeing Pete and starting him off with the\r\ndogs to look for traces of the feline thief, “I’m getting to be\r\ninterested in that scheme of hunting with a camera, and I think I’ll\r\ntake it up soon. There are plenty of good chances for doing\r\nsomething of that sort around here, you know. I want you to put me\r\nwise to all the wrinkles of the game before you say goodbye, which I\r\nhope won’t be for quite some time yet.”\r\n\r\n“What are we going to do this afternoon, boys?” asked Andy.\r\n\r\n“Well, if that question is aimed at me,” ventured Tubby, quickly, “I\r\nknow what I’d like to do, that is if Ralph happens to have plenty of\r\nammunition for that bully little Flobert rifle of his. Frogs for\r\nmine, thank you. One thing I like about this scheme of shooting the\r\njumpers is it doesn’t seem half as cruel as catching them with a\r\nhook, even if you do intend to put them out of their misery soon\r\nafterwards.”\r\n\r\nTubby was known to have a tender heart, and would not hurt anything\r\nif he could possibly help it.\r\n\r\nRalph proposed that if the others felt inclined, they might make a\r\nrun out to a certain lake he knew, where they would likely have a\r\npleasant time.\r\n\r\n“Whether we get any bass or not we’ll certainly enjoy the run with\r\nyou, Ralph,” Rob told him. “As we’ve gone to the trouble to fetch\r\nsome rods and fishing tackle along, it would be a pity not to wet\r\nthe lines just once. So far as I’m concerned, I only too gladly say\r\n‘yes’ to your proposition.”\r\n\r\nSim and Andy immediately voiced their sentiments in the same way,\r\nand so it was settled. Tubby would be fixed out with the small\r\nFlobert rifle and a supply of ammunition, also rubber boots, for he\r\nmight have to do some wading in order to retrieve his game after\r\nshooting it. He promised to have a mess of frogs’ legs ready for the\r\nevening meal when the boys came back.\r\n\r\n“See to it that you fellows do your duty with the gamey bass!” he\r\ncalled out as the other four piled into the big car, ready to start\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n“I heard you call that young chap, who was filling the gas tank,\r\nPeleg; is he one of the workmen on the farm, Ralph?” Rob asked after\r\nthey had gotten fairly started, for he chanced to be sitting\r\nalongside the driver at the time, the other boys occupying the rear\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nHe saw that Ralph had a slight frown on his face, as though\r\nsomething unpleasant had come into his mind just then, possibly\r\ninduced by mention of the name.\r\n\r\n“Yes, his name is Peleg Pinder,” he replied in jerky sentences. “His\r\nfather was a sort of hard case in Wyoming, and the family seemed to\r\nbe always in a peck of trouble. Some folks said the children’d all\r\nbe worthless, just like their good-for-nothing dad. Then there was a\r\nfire, and Peleg’s father was burned trying to save an old crippled\r\nwoman. Somehow people thought better of him after he died. The\r\nchildren scattered. One girl is working for a farmer seven miles\r\naway. My father took Peleg in, and gave him a home. Been with us six\r\nmonths or so now.”\r\n\r\n“How about his work--he seems lively enough, and good-natured. In\r\nfact,” continued Rob, “I rather like the sparkle in his eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he fooled me right along, too,” said Ralph, with a trace of a\r\nsneer in his tone. “He does his work so you couldn’t really find any\r\nfault; but then it’s hard to shake off a bad name, and the Pinders\r\nalways were shiftless and deceitful, Wyoming folks believe.”\r\n\r\nRob was interested at once, and for a reason. He hated to see any\r\none “picked on” simply because “people” chose to believe no good\r\ncould come out of a family that had a shirker for a father. Why, the\r\nvery fact that poor Pinder had died while performing an act of\r\nheroism ought to be enough to prove that such a wholesale\r\ncondemnation was utterly wrong.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got some sort of reason for saying that, I imagine, Ralph?”\r\nhe continued, bent on discovering the truth now that he was at it.\r\n\r\n“Well, I have, though I didn’t mean to mention it to any of you,\r\nbecause for one thing I wanted you to have a jolly time of it here,\r\nand without bothering about any of my troubles. Then, again, I hate\r\nto speak ill of anybody, even Peleg Pinder.”\r\n\r\n“What has he been doing, then, to make you suspect him?” demanded\r\nRob.\r\n\r\nAfter hesitating for a brief interval, as though he hardly knew just\r\nhow much to say, Ralph went on to explain.\r\n\r\n“Hang it all,” he commenced, “I hate to say a word about it, because\r\nit makes me feel mean, just as if I might be picking on a poor chap\r\nwho hadn’t any other friends but my folks, and who’s got a heavy\r\nenough load as it is. Believe me, I haven’t so much as breathed a\r\nword of this to dad. He’d fire Peleg if he knew, and then I might be\r\nsorry. But I’m honestly up a stump trying to decide what I ought to\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me about it then, Ralph; perhaps I might be able to help you\r\nout?” suggested the other.\r\n\r\n“All right, then, I will!” declared the driver, as he skillfully\r\navoided a hole in the road ahead. “About three days ago I made a\r\nlittle discovery that bothered me. It seemed that some one was\r\nhelping themselves to some things I kept in that room out in the\r\nbarn, a place I had fitted up a long while ago as a sort of boy’s\r\nden, you know, where I kept all my treasures, books, games, stamp\r\ncollection and coins, as well as a lot of other things.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I remember you showing us, though you didn’t stay in there\r\nlong, I noticed,” Rob went on to remark, significantly.\r\n\r\n“That was because I felt bad about something,” explained Ralph.\r\n“Fact is, I had just made an unpleasant discovery, which was to the\r\neffect that some one had for the second time been poking around\r\namong my things, and carried off a number of packets of valuable\r\nstamps that I knew positively I had left there on the desk, meaning\r\nto return them to the dealer.”\r\n\r\n“But if this happened once before,” said Rob, “how did it come you\r\nneglected to put a padlock on the door?”\r\n\r\n“I had my reasons,” answered Ralph stoutly, and with a flash of fire\r\nin his eyes. “First, because I hated to think that anything had to\r\nbe locked up so as to keep employees about the place from helping\r\nthemselves. Second, I wasn’t quite sure that my first loss was a\r\ncertainty. Then again, Rob, I was figuring on laying some sort of\r\ntrap so as to catch the rascal in the act, and settle the business.”\r\n\r\n“But now you are sure a light-handed fellow has taken your things,\r\nwhat do you expect to do about it?” queried Rob.\r\n\r\n“I ought to warn my father,” said the other, regretfully. “He hates\r\na thief above all things. I’m sure he would discharge Peleg in a\r\nhurry. You see, Peleg has always been allowed to enter my den as he\r\npleased; in fact, anybody could, because I trust the men who work\r\nfor us.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” Rob continued, significantly, “I hope before you tell your\r\nfather you let me try to identify the thief, because I don’t believe\r\nit can be Peleg Pinder.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Chapter VII\r\n\r\n                       Turning It Over to Rob\r\n\r\n\r\nRalph turned hastily and gave Rob a strange look. Unconsciously he\r\nwas already beginning to realize that Rob Blake could always be\r\ndepended on to do the right thing when it came to a question of\r\naction.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got a reason for talking like that, I’m sure, Rob?” he\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n“I admit it,” came the answer, without the slightest hesitation.\r\n“Tell me first if you positively know that Peleg took your things?”\r\n\r\n“Well, the evidence is only what you might call circumstantial,”\r\nadmitted the other. “I remembered seeing him going hurriedly out of\r\nthe barn an hour before I showed you and the rest of the fellows\r\nthrough there. He acted a bit guilty. I thought he avoided us; but\r\nthe poor fellow has always been somewhat shy about meeting\r\nstrangers, because he must know some mention will be made of his\r\nhistory, and that of his family. No, I can’t say I’ve got any\r\npositive proof he is the guilty one, if that’s what you mean.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you something, Ralph,” said the patrol leader, quietly.\r\n“Perhaps it may not mean much to you; but when a fellow becomes a\r\nscout, you see, he begins to study character, and notices a good\r\nmany little things that show which way the wind blows, just as\r\nstraws are said to do.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, then, please; I’ll be glad to hear what you have to say,\r\nRob.”\r\n\r\n“It happened that when I was alone this morning I took a little\r\nstroll back of the barns, just to amuse myself by looking at the\r\npigs, for they’re always amusing, in my mind. There I ran across\r\nPeleg, though at the time I didn’t know that was his name, or\r\nanything about him. What do you suppose the boy was doing?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I couldn’t guess in a year,” replied the other.\r\n\r\n“Well, he had managed to pick up a young crow that had in some way\r\nbroken its wing and couldn’t fly,” continued Rob, with a smile. “I\r\nsuppose it would have been put out of its misery in a hurry by any\r\nordinary farm hand; and perhaps Peleg himself might have fired at\r\nthe black thieves if he found them getting at the corn in the field.\r\nBut a wounded bird, and one in pain, distressed him. He was trying\r\nto mend that broken wing, and I found myself interested in watching\r\nhow he succeeded.”\r\n\r\n“That’s sure a queer thing for a farm boy to do,” admitted Ralph.\r\n“What could have been his idea, do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I imagine he had more than one,” Rob replied, soberly enough. “In\r\nthe first place, he was sorry for the poor thing, for he handled it\r\nas tenderly as if it had been a human being. Then I actually suspect\r\nthat the boy has, deep down in his heart, a vague desire to do\r\nsurgical work, though you might find it hard to believe.”\r\n\r\nRalph whistled.\r\n\r\n“You don’t say?” he ejaculated, looking as though he hardly knew\r\nwhether to laugh at the idea, or take what Rob was explaining\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n“I told you I was interested,” the other went on, “and I asked him a\r\nnumber of questions as to who had showed him how to go about mending\r\na bird’s broken wing in that way. He said no one had, but it just\r\nseemed to be the natural thing for him to do. Honestly, Ralph, when\r\nI saw what a clever job he made of it I knew that boy had the making\r\nof a grand surgeon in him, if ever he found a chance to do the\r\nproper studying. It’s a gift, you know, with some people, and money\r\ncan never purchase it. Clever surgeons are born, not made.”\r\n\r\nAgain Ralph puckered up his lips, and gave vent to a whistle, which\r\nseemed to be his pet way of expressing surprise.\r\n\r\n“All that is mighty interesting, I own up, Rob,” he said, presently,\r\nafter he had taken a little time to think matters over. “If it\r\nhadn’t been for this unfortunate happening, I’d be tickled half to\r\ndeath to try and encourage Peleg if he had secret ambitions that\r\nway. But why do you think, because he bothered mending a broken wing\r\nfor a young crow, that he couldn’t have robbed me?”\r\n\r\n“For this reason,” replied Rob. “Remember, I may turn out wrong, but\r\nI’m going on general principles when I say that I never yet have\r\nfound that a fellow with such a tender heart could really be a bad\r\ncase. So, on the strength of my observations, I want you to promise\r\nme that you’ll suspend sentence on Peleg until you have more\r\npositive proof.”\r\n\r\n“I agree, and only too willingly,” said Ralph. “In fact, I’ll be\r\nglad to turn the whole case over into your hands for settlement. Do\r\njust whatever you think best about it. If you need any help, call on\r\nme. I’d be mighty glad to learn I was doing Peleg an injustice; for\r\nI’d try and make it up to him in every way I could. Shake hands on\r\nthat, Rob, will you?”\r\n\r\nSo the agreement was ratified, and the other boys in the back seat\r\ndid not even know what their chums had been discussing. It happened\r\nthat Sim and Andy were engaged in a heated argument concerning\r\nsomething that they did not think the same about.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards they arrived at the lake where they expected to\r\ndo their fishing. A boat was procured, and after they had purchased\r\nsome live bait from a man who lived near the water they started\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nThis was a sport which Rob and his two chums always enjoyed very\r\nmuch. Perhaps they might not meet with such good luck as if they had\r\ncome early in the morning; but, then, no one can tell when the bass\r\nwill take hold. It often happens that on a hot and still day nothing\r\nmay be done until along about four in the afternoon when a breeze\r\narises, with a spatter of rain in the bargain. Somehow, every fish\r\nin the lake seems to get ravenously hungry all at once, judging from\r\nthe way in which they snap at any kind of bait.\r\n\r\n“Let’s hope some such good luck comes our way, then,” remarked Sim,\r\nwhen Ralph had mentioned this peculiarity in connection with the\r\ngamiest fish that swims in fresh water, barring none. “The day has\r\nbeen warm and still enough, for that matter. There are signs of a\r\nshower later on, if those clouds mean anything over in the\r\nsouthwest. I guess we’d better not go too far away, Ralph, because\r\nfor one I’d hate to get soaked through and through.”\r\n\r\n“I’m taking the waterproof coverings from the car along, so that in\r\ncase it does rain we can keep fairly dry,” explained Ralph, as they\r\nstarted forth.\r\n\r\nFor an hour they had very little luck. Then the conditions mentioned\r\nby Ralph seemed to suddenly come about, for the clouds covered the\r\nheavens, a breeze sprang up, and drops of rain began to fall.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got one, and a hard fighter!” shouted Sim, as he bent his\r\nenergies to the task of successfully playing his victim in order to\r\ntire the fish out, so a landing net might be successfully used.\r\n\r\n“Here’s another, and just as big as yours, Sim!” ejaculated Andy\r\nfrom the bow.\r\n\r\nBy the time Sim managed to boat his catch, Rob was busily engaged;\r\nand, in turn, Ralph found plenty to do in handling an even more\r\nvicious fighter.\r\n\r\n“Say, this is the best fishing I ever struck!” admitted Sim, some\r\ntime later, as he cracked another capture on the head with a billet\r\nof wood in order to put it out of suffering, and then deposited the\r\nvictim with a dozen others lying in the bottom of the boat.\r\n\r\nThe fun kept up furiously for half an hour more. Then the bass\r\nceased biting almost as suddenly as they had commenced. Perhaps the\r\nfact that the clouds had broken, allowing the sun to shine again,\r\nhad something to do with this change.\r\n\r\n“We ought to be satisfied!” declared Andy, “after all that fun. I\r\nreckon we must have as many as twenty bass in the boat, running as\r\nhigh as three pounds, and enough to make a meal for two families.”\r\n\r\n“Dandy fighters every one of ’em!” added Sim, “and I’ll remember\r\nthis afternoon, I tell you, Ralph. This is a great little lake, and\r\ndoesn’t seem to be fished to death, either.”\r\n\r\n“No, the people down at Wyoming seem to prefer going to several\r\nother lakes and streams nearer at home,” the other explained.\r\n“Besides that, most of them are born trout fishermen. You know, some\r\nfellows pretend to look down on black bass as game fish.”\r\n\r\n“Well, they don’t know what a fighter is, then, that’s all,”\r\nasserted Andy. “My stout rod bent nearly double many a time when\r\nthey bore down. ’Course a bass doesn’t jump for a fly like a trout,\r\njust sucks it in; but once hooked I’ll match him against anything\r\nthat wears fins and scales.”\r\n\r\nThey were now ready to quit and start for home. Ralph wanted to stop\r\non the way and leave a portion of the catch with a poor widow who\r\nhad a brood of children.\r\n\r\n“We couldn’t begin to eat them all, you know,” he told the others.\r\n“I’m sportsman enough to stop taking fish when some one can’t use\r\nthem. Mrs. Murphy has a hard time getting on with her family. We all\r\nlike to give her a hand when we can. Many’s the string of fish I’ve\r\nleft at her door, even when I had to go home without any myself.\r\nBut, then, I’m not very fond of bass for eating, much as I love to\r\nfeel them pull at the end of my line.”\r\n\r\n“What was that you were saying about our going in to town tomorrow,\r\nRalph?” asked Sim, when they were well on their way home.\r\n\r\n“Why, there’s going to be a pretty fine entertainment, and I thought\r\nyou’d like to hear that girl sing dad was telling you about. We\r\nbelieve she’s going to make her mark on the opera stage some of\r\nthese days. So, if you’re agreeable, we’ll run in.”\r\n\r\nIt was decided that way, and not one of them dreamed how a strange\r\nDestiny was shaping her ends in beckoning them toward the town of\r\nWyoming after nightfall, yet such really proved to be the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Chapter VIII\r\n\r\n                    A Great Day for Water Sport\r\n\r\n\r\n“I guess you’re taking us home by another road, eh, Ralph?” remarked\r\nSim.\r\n\r\n“Noticed where I cut loose from the main line, did you?” laughed the\r\npilot. “Well, we can strike it again further on.”\r\n\r\n“Want us to see more of the country; or is there something special\r\nup this way?” queried the visiting Jeffords boy.\r\n\r\n“Well, partly that. Mrs. Murphy lives on this dirt road, you see;\r\nand I’ve got that nice string of fish to leave at her house. There,\r\nyou can see the cottage over yonder. She’s always so glad to have a\r\nbatch of bass. As I said before, she has a big family, and not much\r\nmoney to run it on.”\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards they stopped in front of a modest cottage, where\r\nseveral half-grown children were playing in the yard. Immediately\r\nloud shouts attested to the fact that they had recognized Ralph.\r\nAccordingly, there was a rush for the road, so that when the widow\r\ncame out, attracted by their cries, the entire family surrounded the\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nThe fish were duly delivered, and Mrs. Murphy, as usual, was lavish\r\nwith her sincere thanks. Rob and his chums were interested. This\r\nsort of thing happened to be along the lines of their own doings;\r\nsince nothing pleased them more than to do something for those who\r\nwere in need of assistance.\r\n\r\nBesides, it raised Ralph higher in their esteem than before. Rob\r\nprivately made up his mind that a fellow who could be thinking of\r\nothers so much of the time as Ralph did, and who delighted to be of\r\nhelp to those in need, would make the finest sort of a scout leader.\r\nHe was more determined than ever that before leaving the Jeffords\r\nfarm he must convert Ralph, and start him on the road to organize a\r\ntroop of scouts in Wyoming, this time along true lines, so that the\r\ntown would be proud to acknowledge them as representing the best\r\nthat was in American boys.\r\n\r\nJust as the pilot had said, they soon came out again on the main\r\nroad, and in due time arrived home. The first thing they saw was\r\nTubby, sitting there on the front steps leading to the long porch,\r\nwhere he might just as well have occupied a comfortable chair, but,\r\nbeing a boy, he chose to camp out on the steps.\r\n\r\nHe waved a hand at them, and seemed to be smiling broadly, from\r\nwhich those who knew Tubby so well were able to draw certain\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n“I wager Tubby’s had a fine afternoon’s sport,” remarked Andy\r\nBowles.\r\n\r\n“Oh! it doesn’t take so very much to make him grin from ear to ear;\r\nand it’s some stretch, at that,” chuckled Sim.\r\n\r\n“I think he’s a mighty fine fellow, if you asked my opinion,”\r\nremarked Ralph.\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t be a bit off the road there, either,” Rob told him.\r\n“Tubby has the best disposition of any boy I know. There isn’t\r\nanything he wouldn’t do for another fellow; and the best of it is he\r\nnever stops to consider whether it’s a friend or an enemy he’s\r\ntrying to help; though, for that matter, Tubby has so few enemies\r\nthey hardly count.”\r\n\r\nThe object of this side talk now sauntered up. He looked rather the\r\nworse for wear, his trousers being muddy, and his face still rosy\r\nfrom exertion.\r\n\r\n“Got a pretty nice mess of bass, didn’t you, fellows?” he remarked,\r\nas Sim lifted the string, and tossed the catch out of the car.\r\n\r\n“Oh! that’s just half of all we took,” Andy hastened to explain.\r\n“You see, there were too many for our own use, and Ralph here had an\r\nold lady friend with a big family on her hands, who looks to him to\r\nkeep her supplied with fresh fish; so we dropped the other string at\r\nher house on the way home. How did you come out with your frog\r\nhunting, Tubby?”\r\n\r\n“I had just a glorious time of it, Andy,” the other replied. “Come\r\nover to the ice-house and see, for they’re keeping cool until it’s\r\ntime to cook them for our supper. Better fetch the fish along with\r\nyou, too, while about it.”\r\n\r\nAll of them followed him across the yard to the ice-house. This was\r\nso built that it could be used to take the place of a refrigerator;\r\nand fresh meat, butter and such things were kept there nice and\r\nsweet.\r\n\r\nTubby swooped down and lifted a platter that was covered with green\r\nleaves. As he removed these there were revealed several rows of\r\n“saddles,” as the long hindlegs of bullfrogs are called in the\r\nmarket, where they bring as much as eighty cents a pound, sometimes\r\neven more, according to supply and demand, and are considered a\r\ngreat delicacy by epicures.\r\n\r\n“They look pretty fine to me, Tubby,” said Rob, admiringly. “How\r\nmany did you knock over with the little Flobert rifle?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know, I’m kind of systematic in my ways, boys,” Tubby\r\nexplained. “So in the beginning I set a limit, and when I got to the\r\ntwenty-five mark I quit business. Jiminy crickets! I could have had\r\na hundred as well as not, if I had been greedy; but you know that\r\nisn’t in my line. They are such busters, too; why, a fellow couldn’t\r\nget away with more than four such monster saddles unless he turned\r\nout to be a hog.”\r\n\r\n“Only four apiece,” said Sim, pretending to look sad.\r\n\r\n“But some people don’t care for frogs’ legs, I’m told,” Tubby\r\nadmonished him, as he shot a look toward Ralph, who not long before\r\nhad said something to that effect, it may be remembered.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got something else on your mind,” suggested Andy, who knew\r\nthe signs; “better open up and tell us what’s happened while we were\r\ngone. You never were built to keep a secret; it shows in your face\r\nright away.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! well, I meant to tell you about it, boys. Look here, what do\r\nyou think of this?” and as he spoke Tubby turned around, pushed a\r\npiece of burlap aside, and showed them an object hanging by a piece\r\nof rope, a rather ghastly object, too.\r\n\r\n“Wow! a turtle, with its throat cut!” exclaimed Andy, staring as\r\nthough he could hardly believe his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Did you shoot that big snapper?” demanded Ralph. “Why, he would\r\nhave taken a piece out of your leg if ever he managed to get a hold.\r\nA fellow has to be pretty careful how he handles a snapping turtle.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he just missed me by an inch,” said Tubby, proudly. “After\r\nthat I was fighting shy of that head when it darted at you like\r\nlightning. You see, I came on this whopper while I was moving around\r\nthe pond, trying to see some of the frogs squatting among the grass\r\nand reeds and moss. I don’t know why a turtle should be out of the\r\nwater and up on the bank, except it comes out to lay its eggs, they\r\nsay, and then in the Spring; but there it was, and when I almost\r\nstepped on it, it gave a wicked lunge at me.”\r\n\r\n“Quite exciting, wasn’t it, Tubby?” laughed Andy.\r\n\r\n“To me it was,” admitted the fat boy, unconcernedly. “I made up my\r\nmind I ought to capture that fellow. They say snappers are death to\r\nfrogs, and ducks, and even fish; but as I didn’t dare touch the\r\ncrawler, I hunted up a stout stick and tried to turn him over. My\r\nstars! he struck it hard, and held on like a bulldog, but I managed\r\nto drag him further up on the bank. I was wondering what I should do\r\nwith him when Peleg came along, and saw what I had found. He told me\r\nyou could eat snappers; and while I drew his head as far out as I\r\ncould,--I mean the turtle’s, of course,--him holding on to the stick\r\nlike grim death, why, Peleg used his knife to end his troubles. So\r\nhere he is or she is, I don’t know which; and if Ralph says the same\r\nas Peleg did, and that snappers can be eaten, why we stand to have\r\nturtle steak and turtle soup.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “He held on like a bull-dog.”]\r\n\r\nRalph admitted that he had partaken of snapping turtle diet on more\r\nthan one occasion, and found it fairly to his liking, though he did\r\nnot really “hanker” after the dish any more than he did frogs’ legs.\r\n\r\n“These other red-marked paddlers are better,” he told them. “Though\r\nI guess none of them come up to the green turtle found in the\r\nSouthern waters near the coast, or the diamond-back terrapin of\r\nMaryland and Virginia. But I’m glad you got this one, Tubby, because\r\nthese snappers do a heap of damage, and are of no earthly good. I’ve\r\nlost dozens of young goslings and ducks through this fellow and his\r\nkind.”\r\n\r\n“One thing sure,” Tubby went on to say, with apparent delight,\r\n“today has been a red-letter day for hauling in a mess of food of\r\nall sorts from the water. Just to think, we’ve got fresh fish,\r\nfrogs’ legs, and turtle to choose from.”\r\n\r\n“Better jot it down in your diary as Marine Day,” laughed Andy.\r\n\r\n“We’ll leave the turtle for tomorrow,” suggested Ralph. “Two kinds\r\nof fish ought to be enough for one meal. I’ll take the bass every\r\ntime. But here’s Peleg, ready to do the job of getting them fixed\r\nfor the pan,” as the half-grown farm boy made his appearance.\r\n\r\n“’Tain’t fair, let me tell you,” complained Tubby. “Here I went and\r\nprepared _my_ catch, all but the turtle, so they could be dipped in\r\ncracker crumbs, and dropped in sizzling hot lard, or else fried\r\nalongside salt port. You fellows get off too easy by having Peleg do\r\nthe work.”\r\n\r\nHe forgot all about this, however, in asking after the particulars\r\nof the fishing trip; and, upon learning how the bass bit so\r\nfiercely, Tubby declared he would like to make one of the next party\r\nthat visited the lake.\r\n\r\n“Frog hunting is all very fine,” he admitted without a bit of shame;\r\n“but it gets monotonous after a while. I like a little variety in my\r\nsport. Besides, the poor greenbacks haven’t a ghost of a chance\r\nbefore that little Flobert of yours, Ralph, which shoots so straight\r\nyou only have to take aim, pull the trigger, and that ends it. Now a\r\nbass on a light rod makes some excitement; and there’s always a\r\nchance for him to give you the merry ha-ha by breaking away. Yes,\r\nnext time count me with you, please.”\r\n\r\nThey took things easy the rest of the afternoon, having enjoyed the\r\nday very much. All sorts of plans were suggested for the future,\r\nsome of which were never to be carried out, for the simple reason\r\nthat events, which none of the boys could foresee, were on the eve\r\nof coming to pass.\r\n\r\nSo the night came on. Supper was somewhat later than usual on\r\naccount of Mr. Jeffords having been away on a business trip to town,\r\nand coming home along toward twilight, long after the sun had set in\r\na blaze of glory.\r\n\r\nThe feast of frogs’ legs proved quite satisfactory to those who were\r\nfond of such a diet. Besides, there was a fine mess of bass, done to\r\na turn by the colored mammy in the kitchen, who certainly knew the\r\nsecret of making various dishes appear very tempting and appetizing;\r\nas well as roast chicken, corn, new potatoes, and last, but far from\r\nleast, two kinds of pies that equalled the product of any New\r\nEngland kitchen.\r\n\r\nAll of the boys were hungry when they sat down to the table, but by\r\nthe time half an hour had gone by Tubby was seen to hardly shake his\r\nhead when asked to have another helping. Andy Bowles undid his belt\r\nwhen he thought no one was looking his way, both of which incidents\r\nwent to tell the story of “enough being as good as a feast.”\r\n\r\nThey had just about made up their minds to leave the table when\r\nexcited voices reached them. Then Peleg came hurrying in, looking\r\nanxious. He said something to Mr. Jeffords in a low voice, at which\r\nthe farmer seemed shocked.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Father?” demanded Ralph.\r\n\r\n“It’s Mrs. Holcomb come over to tell us that one of her children has\r\nbeen lost in the woods since early this morning,” said Mr. Jeffords.\r\n“Her husband has been searching everywhere, and now they call on us\r\nto help them find the poor lost darling. Ralph, get the car, and\r\nwe’ll take her back with us.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Chapter IX\r\n\r\n                           The Scout Law\r\n\r\n\r\nRob and his three chums were immediately interested in this new and\r\npeculiar happening. They had had more or less experience along\r\nsomewhat similar lines on a former occasion, and knew the value of\r\nenlisting scouts, with their knowledge of woodcraft, when any one\r\nchanced to be missing.\r\n\r\nThe woman came into the room just then. She looked greatly\r\ndistressed, though evidently trying hard to control her feelings.\r\n\r\nQuestions that met with ready replies soon put them in possession of\r\nsuch facts as were at her disposal. The child was a small boy named\r\nCaleb, not over six years of age, though hardy enough. He had never\r\nwandered off before, so that they suspected something unusual must\r\nhave tempted him on this occasion.\r\n\r\nIt had not been until ten o’clock that he was missed. Then the\r\nmother and the other children looked high and low for him without\r\navail. Finally, becoming anxious, she had sent out into the fields\r\nwhere her husband was working, and soon everybody around the region\r\nhad enlisted in the hunt.\r\n\r\nAs the river ran not more than a quarter of a mile away from the\r\nHolcomb home, there were grave fears lest the child might have\r\nwandered that way. Some were even looking along the bank with the\r\nidea that the body would be cast ashore; others, including the now\r\nfrenzied father, were engaged in scouring the woods, calling out the\r\nname of the little fellow from time to time, and then stopping to\r\nlearn if a feeble answer came in reply to their hails.\r\n\r\nRob knew that it might mean a long and difficult hunt. He also\r\nunderstood what an advantage it always was to be prepared for such\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n“I saw one of those hand electric torches in your den, Ralph,” he\r\nwent on to say in his energetic fashion. “Do you know whether it has\r\na working battery in it?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure it has,” he was told. “I only brought it home with me\r\nlast week when I was down in the town, and haven’t used it an hour\r\nsince.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad to know it. Please fetch it along,” Rob told him. “Torches\r\nmay be all very well as a makeshift, but give me such a light as\r\nyours when you want to look into out of the way places. Besides, in\r\ntrailing on a dark night they can’t be equaled. I’ve used one many a\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\nRalph instantly realized that perhaps these scout visitors of his\r\nmight come in very handy in an emergency like this. That mention of\r\n“trailing” gave him an insight into the probable plan of campaign\r\nwhich Rob was likely to institute; and so Ralph made up his mind\r\nthat it would be a good thing to hand the manipulation of affairs\r\nover to the boy in khaki who seemed to know just what to do, as well\r\nas how to do it.\r\n\r\nThey lost little time in getting ready. Ralph soon had the car at\r\nthe door, and they commenced to pile in, after Mrs. Holcomb had been\r\ntucked away in the capacious rear seat. Rob noticed with more or\r\nless interest that Peleg insisted on joining the party, as though\r\njust as eager to have a hand in finding the lost boy as any of them.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time some one would ask more questions. Rob in\r\nparticular seemed to want to find out all he could before arriving\r\non the ground. These queries as a rule turned on such points as the\r\nlast that had been seen of little Caleb, and whether he had any\r\nfriends living near by whom he would be likely to want to visit,\r\nthough possibly getting lost while on the way there.\r\n\r\nIn this way Rob picked up more or less information that might come\r\nin useful later, when on the ground. Ralph heard how he managed to\r\ndraw these more or less important facts from the now sobbing mother.\r\nHe also admired the way in which Rob told her not to worry, for they\r\nwere almost certain to find her boy before morning.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Tubby thought he ought to say a few words in order\r\nto help comfort the sorely stricken woman.\r\n\r\n“You know, ma’m,” he told her, for he chanced to be sitting\r\nalongside Mrs. Holcomb at the time, “we scouts are trained in the\r\nart of tracking people as well as animals. Why, several times we’ve\r\nproved that we could find a lost party when no one else knew how to\r\ngo about it. It is scout law to respond to any call for help, and\r\nwe’re just bound to do all we can. Yes, ma’m, there was a poor\r\nhalf-demented man lived down in Hampton who used to be watched by\r\nhis folks very close; but, in spite of it all, one time he managed\r\nto give ’em the slip, and went into the scrub, which, down on Long\r\nIsland, is like a wilderness, and easy to get lost in.”\r\n\r\nTubby waited a few seconds so as to get his second breath, and then\r\nwent on with his story, which he meant to be comforting to the poor\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n“After they had searched and searched for two days they came to the\r\nscouts and begged us to please lend a hand. By that time the trail\r\nhad grown pretty cold, you see, but Rob here went at it like he\r\nalways does, with a vim, and I give you my word for it, ma’m, before\r\nthree hours had passed we found the man, though he was----”\r\n\r\n“That’ll do, Tubby, don’t bother with the particulars!” interrupted\r\nRob, fearing that the benefit which the recital was intended to have\r\nupon the overwrought nerves of the poor woman might lose something\r\nof its value if Tubby told that the demented man was really dead\r\nwhen they finally found him in the scrub oak wilderness a mile or\r\ntwo back from the beach.\r\n\r\nRalph was at the wheel, and he knew his road, so that before a great\r\nwhile they drew near the place where the Holcombs lived. The woman\r\nhad driven over in a buggy, but her rig could be recovered later on.\r\nTime was too valuable to allow her to return home in the same\r\ntedious manner as she had come.\r\n\r\n“Looky yonder, will you?” burst out Tubby. “What are those lights\r\nglimmering in the woods over yonder? Seem like a pack of giant\r\nfireflies to me. Rob, do you reckon they can be lanterns carried by\r\nsome of the people who are searching everywhere, helter-skelter\r\nlike, for little Caleb?”\r\n\r\n“Just what they are, Tubby,” replied the scout leader; “and, as you\r\nsay, they are likely enough running this way and that without a bit\r\nof reason. Why, they would go over the same ground a dozen times,\r\nand skip lots of places that ought to be looked into. We’ll try to\r\nlay out a concerted plan of action--that is, in case there isn’t any\r\ntrail to be found.”\r\n\r\n“I’m a bit afraid we won’t have much luck in that quarter, Rob,”\r\nsaid Sim. “When you come to think of it, a little fellow like a\r\nsix-year-old doesn’t make much of a dent when he steps out, like a\r\nheavy man would, or Tubby here.”\r\n\r\n“Still, there are ways of following a trail besides always seeing\r\nthe impression of feet,” hinted Rob. “But wait and see how we fare.\r\nThe ground must be in pretty good condition for tracking, under the\r\ntrees. Even a small chap like him could turn over the pine needles\r\nas he tramped along, and you can always tell that by the freshness\r\nof those that are disturbed--those on top, you know, look faded in\r\nthe sun and air and rain.”\r\n\r\nRalph listened and nodded his head in approval. Such confident talk\r\naroused his sincere admiration. He felt more than ever that Rob must\r\nbe a remarkable boy; and if the mere fact of being a scout could\r\naccount for any degree of his cleverness, then perhaps this\r\neducation they spoke of, running along the lines of a knowledge of\r\nwoodcraft, first aid to the injured, preparedness, lending a helping\r\nhand, and all that sort of thing might not be such a bad subject,\r\nafter all, to study. Somehow, his opinion of scouts in general was\r\nundergoing a steady change. He meant to keep tabs on every action of\r\nthese four fellows, now that they were face to face with another\r\nemergency. If they could come out of this difficulty as successfully\r\nas Rob had done when that boy with the dislocated shoulder fell into\r\nhis charge, Ralph would be almost ready to surrender and admit he\r\nhad been badly mistaken.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the house it was to find quite a gathering of\r\nneighboring women present. Rob knew nothing was to be gained by\r\ncoming in contact with these people, for while their intentions\r\nmight be commendable, they were only apt to hinder the work with\r\ntheir questions, and by advancing impossible theories.\r\n\r\nHe asked Mrs. Holcomb to please let him speak with her oldest girl,\r\nwho, it appeared, had been the last one to notice little Caleb\r\nbefore the fact of his vanishing had become known.\r\n\r\nAll Rob wanted to learn was about the time of day this happened, and\r\nin which quarter the child had been at the time. To his mind that\r\nwould mark the beginning of the trail, and he did not mean to have\r\nany of the women around when starting to search for the tiny tracks.\r\n\r\nJust as he expected, no one had as yet thought to search the ground\r\nfor signs of the wanderer’s shoe prints; instead of that, they had\r\nscattered through the woods, or rushed madly away toward the river,\r\nhoping to find the boy before anything serious happened to him.\r\n\r\nRob soon learned the few things the half-grown girl could tell him\r\nbetween her violent sobs.\r\n\r\n“Now come with me, fellows, and we’ll start off,” he told the others\r\nas they gathered eagerly around him.\r\n\r\nMr. Jeffords continued with them. Something seemed to tell him that\r\nthese wide-awake and up-to-date scouts would have a much better\r\nchance of getting results than all those husky men who were roaming\r\nthe woods at random, shouting to one another, or else calling out\r\nthe name of the child.\r\n\r\nArriving at the spot where the girl said the small boy had last been\r\nseen, Rob asked the others to stay at a certain place while he and\r\nSim used the electric torch in the endeavor to find the first trace\r\nof those tiny footprints.\r\n\r\nThe night had set in quite dark by now, so that only for the glow of\r\nthat useful little torch they would have had to depend wholly on the\r\nlanterns Peleg and Ralph carried.\r\n\r\nShooting the strong white light downward, the two boys proceeded to\r\nlook thoroughly about them, scanning every object that fell in their\r\nway, and utilizing their utmost stock of woodcraft in the work.\r\n\r\nWhen possibly five minutes had elapsed, though it certainly seemed\r\nmuch longer than that to the waiting group close by, Sim gave\r\nutterance to a cry of exultation that thrilled the others.\r\n\r\n“Found the trail, have you, fellows?” called out Ralph, excitedly.\r\n\r\n“Come over here and see,” Rob told him.\r\n\r\nHe made them act cautiously, so that they might not blot the “signs”\r\nout by their own footprints. He pointed to the plain impression of a\r\ntiny shoe in the soft earth. There could be no doubt but that the\r\nmark had been made by Caleb; and, it was agreed, if only they could\r\nsuccessfully follow where that trail led, they would sooner or later\r\nknow where the child had gone.\r\n\r\n“Try and see if you can follow it, Rob,” urged Tubby, impatiently,\r\nthough there was also a confident ring to his voice, as well as a\r\nsuspicion of pride about his manner, for he fully believed that the\r\nability of the scouts in a case of this kind was about to be\r\nvindicated.\r\n\r\nThey watched with an eagerness words could hardly paint, while Rob,\r\naccompanied by Sim, began to slowly move along. There was a growing\r\nconfidence in the way the trackers took up their task that promised\r\nwell for the success of the enterprise. Ralph felt his heart beating\r\ntumultuously in his breast as he mentally pictured the ecstatic joy\r\nof restoring the lost child to his distracted mother’s arms.\r\n\r\nThey were moving steadily along. Now and then Rob would pause for a\r\nbrief period of time, perhaps to make sure that he was on the right\r\ntrack, or it might be to show the others something that caused them\r\nincreasing satisfaction.\r\n\r\nForgotten were all the other searchers in the Adirondack woods; let\r\nthem rush this way and that in their hunt without a method; but the\r\nscouts were on the right track, and if fortune were kind, they meant\r\nto follow it to success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Chapter X\r\n\r\n                       A Wild Grapevine Rope\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir progress was of necessity tedious, but what did that matter,\r\nso long as it was sure? A tender little fellow like Caleb could not\r\ncover a very great distance before giving out, when he would be\r\nforced to drop to the ground, perhaps yielding to a desire to go to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nTubby and Andy were discussing this very thing, as they came along\r\nafter the two leaders. Occasionally Ralph joined in the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“How far do you think a little chap like that could cover from\r\nmorning up to now?” Tubby asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh! not over a couple of miles, I should say, but at the most twice\r\nthat far,” Andy replied, after giving the matter a little thought.\r\n“Even at that he’d be apt to repeat, that is, wander around in a\r\ncircle, so at the end of the day he mightn’t be over a full mile\r\nfrom where he started.”\r\n\r\n“But they said the river was only a quarter of a mile off,”\r\nsuggested Tubby, darkly.\r\n\r\n“Get that notion out of your head to begin with, please,”\r\ninterrupted Ralph. “I’m glad to tell you that we’ve been going in a\r\ncourse that would never fetch out at the river; fact is, it lies\r\nalmost directly the other way.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I’m glad of that, Ralph, and thank you for telling us about\r\nit!” ejaculated Tubby, with a heavy sigh of relief. “Because right\r\nalong I’ve been picturing little Caleb falling in, and no one near\r\nto hear his cries for help. Then, if he isn’t drowned, we’re just\r\nbound to find him.”\r\n\r\nThe same confidence seemed to possess Andy Bowles after hearing\r\nRalph say there was no danger of running across the swift river in\r\nthis direction. Meanwhile, those in the van were making steady\r\nprogress. Their little difficulties did not seem to daunt them in\r\nthe least, for after a brief pause now and then they would always\r\nproceed with the same assurance, as though positive of their\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nRalph presently drew a little closer to the leaders. He knew that\r\nthey consulted from time to time, and he wished to be near enough to\r\ncatch what was said, for by degrees Ralph was finding himself\r\nbecoming more and more interested in all that pertained to the\r\neducation of a scout. He knew no better way in which to pick up\r\nsterling points than by listening.\r\n\r\nLater on, after they had been progressing in this fashion for\r\nupwards of a whole hour, he heard Rob saying something that\r\ninterested him very much.\r\n\r\n“See how he wobbles from side to side as he goes on, will you, Sim?\r\nThat shows he must have been getting pretty tired about the time he\r\nreached here.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a fact, Rob,” added the other scout, anxiously. “It wouldn’t\r\nsurprise me a whit if we ran across the poor little chap somewhere\r\nabout here fast asleep. I don’t believe there’s any wild animal\r\naround that would hurt him, do you?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly, unless that savage old cat we saw up at Ralph’s pens had\r\nwandered over this way, which isn’t likely. I’m throwing the light\r\non either side now, you notice, as we go along. Little Caleb may\r\nhave come part way back again before dropping.”\r\n\r\n“How would it do for the rest of us to spread out with the lanterns,\r\nand keep on the watch, Rob?” asked Ralph just then.\r\n\r\n“Such a move would do no harm, anyhow,” the other replied, knowing\r\nvery well how anxious all of them must be to feel that they were\r\nhaving a share in the work.\r\n\r\nAfter that they continued on for some time. Rob was more than ever\r\nconvinced the lost child had reached a point bordering on\r\nexhaustion, and that on no account could such a weak little chap\r\nkeep on his feet much longer.\r\n\r\nSeveral times they had seen moving lights, showing that some of the\r\nsearching party must be close by; indeed, they heard their shouts at\r\nstated intervals, though not replying to them.\r\n\r\n“It seems queer to me,” Tubby was saying to Andy and Mr. Jeffords\r\nand Peleg, all of whom were near him at the time, “how none of these\r\nmen with lanterns have run across the boy if, as we believe, he’s\r\nclose by here. I should think he’d have heard their calls and tried\r\nto answer them; that is, unless he’s sleeping like a dog, being\r\ntired to death.”\r\n\r\n“Chances are that’s what’s the matter with him,” Andy agreed;\r\nwhereupon both boys settled down to anticipating a cry of joy from\r\nthose in the advance as they suddenly came upon the object of their\r\nsearch, lying asleep amidst the dead leaves just as the famous\r\n“Babes in the Woods” had done in the story.\r\n\r\nSo vastly superior was their method of search over that resorted to\r\nby the frenzied father, and the equally unreliable neighboring\r\nfarmers, that Ralph was ready to give the scouts all the credit they\r\nso fully deserved. He only awaited the final stroke before\r\nconfessing as to the great change in his belief.\r\n\r\nThen Sim was heard to give vent to a cry. Somehow, it pierced the\r\nheart of Tubby just as a dart might have done, because he failed to\r\ndetect the note of conscious triumph that he had so firmly\r\nanticipated. Instead, the cry seemed of surprise and consternation.\r\n\r\n“Oh! what is it, boys?” Tubby called out, with his voice all\r\nunstrung. “I hope now you haven’t found him as we did that poor\r\ndemented man, you know?”\r\n\r\n“We haven’t found him at all, yet,” answered Sim, after drawing a\r\nlong breath, like one who was trying to steel his faint heart\r\nagainst a shock; “but come here, all of you, and see what we _have_\r\nstruck.”\r\n\r\nAt that the others hastened to advance, and were speedily alongside\r\nRob and Sim and Ralph, for the last-named had gained their side\r\nalmost immediately after the first alarm had sounded.\r\n\r\n“Great governor! what’s this?” cried Andy.\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s a gaping hole in the ground, I do believe!” gasped Tubby.\r\n“Oh! do you think the poor darling has fallen in there, Rob?” and\r\nhis usually florid face seemed almost pallid with the horror that\r\nseized upon him as he turned a beseeching look upon the scout\r\nleader.\r\n\r\nRob once more threw the light from the torch upon the ground close\r\nto the edge of that yawning aperture.\r\n\r\n“It looks that way, I must own,” he told them. “See, here are plain\r\nprints of his little shoes close to the brink. Yes, and you can see\r\nwhere some slender bush was dragged, roots and all, from here--the\r\nchances are he unconsciously clutched them when he felt himself\r\nslipping, and pulled it in with him. Poor little chap, what a\r\nterrible shock he must have had.”\r\n\r\nAll of them stared down into the aperture, but even the light from\r\nthe hand torch failed to show them what lay below. They could catch\r\nglimpses of a rough, rocky wall, projecting roots of trees, and some\r\nsort of growing bushes, but if the child were down there they failed\r\nto discover anything of him.\r\n\r\n“Well, who’s going down?” demanded Tubby, as though it were a\r\nforegone conclusion in his mind that such a course must follow. “I’d\r\noffer in a minute, only I’m sure Rob wouldn’t let me try it, while\r\nthere are so many others present better fitted for the job than I\r\nam. But somebody must go down, and how can it be done when we\r\nhaven’t got a sign of a rope with us?”\r\n\r\n“Do you think I could risk dropping down by holding to the face of\r\nthe wall, Rob?” asked Sim, quickly. If the other had answered in the\r\naffirmative, there was no question but that he stood ready to make\r\nthe attempt without delay.\r\n\r\n“Wait a bit and we’ll see,” the scout leader told him. “No need of\r\ndoing anything in such a hurry. If Caleb’s down there, a few minutes\r\nmore or less won’t hurt much; and it may mean a broken leg for you,\r\nSim, if you slipped. I’ve got an idea that may pan out, and make up\r\nfor the lack of a rope. Just back there I noticed a wild grapevine\r\nhanging from a tree. If we could cut that free, we might have a\r\npretty good substitute for a rope, something like twenty feet long.”\r\n\r\n“Fine for you, Rob!” cried Ralph, overcome with admiration. “How\r\nlucky you asked me for my little camp hatchet before we started out.\r\nPerhaps now you even anticipated having just such a need for the\r\nsame! I’m beginning to believe you can see further ahead than any\r\nfellow I ever met.”\r\n\r\nRob made no response, although naturally enough this sort of genuine\r\npraise must have been pleasant to him; especially when coming from a\r\nfellow like the Adirondack boy, whom he was aching to convert to a\r\nnew belief regarding the value scouts may have in a community.\r\n\r\nRob was already hacking away with a vim at the wild grapevine\r\nmentioned, having given the hand torch into the charge of Sim. It\r\ndid not require many blows to sever the vine near its base, for\r\nRalph apparently believed in keeping a fine cutting edge on his pet\r\ntool.\r\n\r\nOnce it was free, they seized hold and commenced to heave, but, of\r\ncourse, this was an effort without any response; the vine was too\r\nsafely anchored to the branches of the tree to be dragged loose as\r\neasily as all that.\r\n\r\n“Let me shin up, and cut it free, Rob,” suggested Sim, who was a\r\ngreat climber in his way, and never so happy as when sporting amidst\r\nthe foliage of some great oak or beechnut tree.\r\n\r\n“All right, if you say so, Sim,” the scout leader told him. “Be sure\r\nand get all the length you can, because we may need it. There’s no\r\ntelling just how deep that hole will turn out to be.”\r\n\r\n“The poor little thing, to think of him falling all the way down\r\nthere!” Tubby was heard to say in sympathetic tones.\r\n\r\nAgile Sim had already tucked the camp hatchet safely in his belt,\r\nand taking a good hold of the swaying vine started his ascent. Some\r\nof the others clutched it below so as to give him a steady support.\r\nSim proved his ability as a climber by the rapid way in which he\r\npassed up among the lower branches of the tree to which the wild\r\ngrapevine was attached.\r\n\r\nTurning the light upward, Rob could follow the progress of the\r\nclimber, and found it convenient to call out occasionally in order\r\nto advise Sim.\r\n\r\n“Not less than twenty feet, and five more if you can make it, Sim!”\r\nhe told the other. “I should think it would be thick enough to hold\r\na ton if it’s only an inch through; these grapevines are tougher\r\nthan any rope ever made. There, try and do your cutting where you\r\nare. Once you get it through, we’ll start to drag again, and I\r\nreckon it’s bound to come next time.”\r\n\r\nA minute later Sim announced that his part of the work had been\r\ncompleted, upon which Rob and Ralph and the others laid hold with\r\nsuch a will that they soon had the severed vine on the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter that Sim joined them, coming sliding down the trunk of the\r\ntree with the agility of a monkey.\r\n\r\nThe vine was carried over to where they had discovered that gaping\r\naperture into which it seemed likely little Caleb had fallen. None\r\nof the boys seemed in any humor for joking just then; indeed, they\r\nwere unusually grave, as though the shadow of some impending tragedy\r\nhung over their heads.\r\n\r\nRob directed operations, and even Ralph seemed only too willing to\r\ndo whatever he was told. Strange, how in emergencies, it is always\r\nthe strong mind that seizes the reins, and all others readily\r\nacquiesce, no matter in whatever shape the orders come. How many a\r\ndesperate enterprise has been carried to a glorious success simply\r\nbecause a fit leader has developed when the conditions demanded;\r\nwhile others that promised well in the beginning have fallen flat\r\nthrough lack of the initiative on the part of the actors.\r\n\r\nThe vine was allowed to drop into the aperture, with the thick end\r\ndown. When it seemed as though it rested firmly on something below,\r\nRob judged that the hole must be all of twenty-three feet deep. That\r\nwas a startling fact when they remembered that a child had stepped\r\ninto that break and must have gone headlong down through space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Chapter XI\r\n\r\n                     The Rescue of Little Caleb\r\n\r\n\r\n“Who’s going down?” asked Sim, with a vein of entreaty in his voice,\r\nfor, being such a good climber, Sim would have gladly assumed that\r\nrole.\r\n\r\n“I intend to,” replied Rob, calmly, and no one disputed his right,\r\nsince he occupied the position of scout leader, and could do as he\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nHe took the torch with him, but as he would probably find a good use\r\nfor both hands during the descent, Rob managed to secure the light\r\nabout his person. Then, as he found occasion to make use of it, he\r\ncould easily do so.\r\n\r\n“Hold fast to the old vine, boys, whatever you do,” was his last\r\nremark as he started to slide over the brink.\r\n\r\nRob seemed perfectly cool. If he felt nervous at all, it was in\r\nconnection with the possibility of finding poor little Caleb lying\r\nbruised and insensible far below.\r\n\r\nThe others waited impatiently. Peering over the edge, even as they\r\ngripped the end of the wild grapevine, they could follow the descent\r\nof their comrade by the aid of the light, for Rob had the battery\r\nturned on purposely.\r\n\r\nHe did not make undue haste, for Rob knew the folly of being too\r\neager. Better consume a little more time, and make sure of results.\r\nIt was bad enough to have one accident without risking another on\r\ntop of it.\r\n\r\n“There, he’s stopping to take a look below!” exclaimed Tubby,\r\nbreathlessly.\r\n\r\nRob, while holding on with one hand, having found a brace for his\r\nfeet, had indeed taken out the torch from his upper coat pocket, and\r\nwas using it to pierce the darkness beneath him.\r\n\r\n“Now he acts like he sees something!” cried Sim. “Look at him wave\r\nhis hand up at us, boys! Anyway, we’ll soon know the worst. I’m\r\nhoping the little chap may not be so badly hurt.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I thought I heard a child give a whimper just then!” gasped\r\nTubby.\r\n\r\nAll of them fell silent at that, for the same impression occurred to\r\nTubby’s companions. They continued to watch Rob with anxious eyes.\r\nYes, he had again started to let himself down, and even as they\r\nstared they saw him come to a stop. Apparently, he had found some\r\nsort of ledge, though it was covered with a species of growing bush\r\nthat disguised it effectually. One thing sure, the descent continued\r\neven beyond the point where Rob had halted.\r\n\r\n“He’s found him, as sure as anything, he has!” ejaculated Andy, his\r\nvoice filled with a strange mixture of satisfaction and awe, for it\r\nyet remained to be discovered what the condition of the little\r\nfellow might turn out to be.\r\n\r\n“Hello! up there!” called Rob, and they believed he was looking\r\nupwards at them, though none of them could be sure about this.\r\n\r\n“Yes, what is it, Rob? Have you found him?” cried Tubby.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’ve got him safe,” came the reply that thrilled him. “He\r\nlanded on this ledge, and was saved the balance of the drop. Luckily\r\nhe dropped on a lot of stuff here that helped to break his fall. I\r\ndon’t know for sure, but I believe he’s not badly hurt, only cut a\r\nlittle. He must have been stunned, though, for he’s only now\r\nbeginning to wake up. Listen, fellows; do you think you could pull\r\nthe grapevine up, and me too?”\r\n\r\n“Easy thing, Rob,” replied Sim, promptly.\r\n\r\n“Then take it slow, and don’t hurry, or you may brush us off,” came\r\nfrom the boy below. “I’ve got to use one arm holding him, you see,\r\nand that handicaps me a bit. Get busy now, boys, heave-o!”\r\n\r\nAs many as could get hold proceeded to lend a hand, even Peleg\r\nexerting himself manfully. The vine began to shorten as they tugged.\r\nEvery now and then Rob would call out to them, giving further\r\ndirections. Once he told them to stop, for he had a fine chance to\r\nset both feet on another small ledge, and in some fashion could\r\nchange his burden to the other arm.\r\n\r\nPresently his head appeared above the brink. Mr. Jeffords was only\r\nwaiting for this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Presently his head appeared above the brink.]\r\n\r\n“Let me take the child from you, Rob,” he said, leaning over\r\nsolicitously.\r\n\r\nWhen the transfer had been safely made it was no trouble to help Rob\r\nover the edge of the precipice, for such the wall of the aperture\r\nappeared to them.\r\n\r\n“Mighty well done, I want to tell you, Rob!” said Ralph, earnestly,\r\nas he squeezed the hand of the still trembling scout leader, for the\r\nrecent effort had naturally been quite a strain on the boy’s nervous\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nRob was laughing. After it was all over he effected to make light of\r\nhis achievement, as that class of boys always do, never liking to\r\nhear themselves praised.\r\n\r\n“Oh! it was a mere trifle, Ralph, and I’m only sorry I monopolized\r\nthe fun. But take the light, will you, and turn it on the boy. I\r\nwant to look him over, and see what the worst is we must expect.”\r\n\r\nThe little fellow presented rather a pitiable aspect. He had\r\nreceived several scratches, and his face was quite bloody; besides\r\nthat, his clothing was badly torn, possibly brought about through\r\nmaking a passage amidst thorns while lost in the woods.\r\n\r\n“Say, he does look pretty bad, now,” admitted Tubby, seriously.\r\n\r\n“Looks don’t count for much, Tubby,” Rob soon told him. “We can wash\r\nhis face and hands, and improve his appearance a hundred per cent;\r\nif only he hasn’t any broken bones; and, so far, I don’t find\r\nanything of that kind. It’s strange how a child may fall from a\r\nfourth-story window and never seem to be hurt. Caleb hit his head,\r\nand has lain in something of a swoon for hours. Perhaps it was just\r\nas well, for if he had moved, he might have fallen the rest of the\r\nway down to the bottom of that hole. He’s just beginning to get his\r\nsenses now, after all this time.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, they could see the boy’s eyes were open, and that he seemed\r\nto be trying to understand where he was, what had happened, and who\r\nthese people around him might be.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right, Caleb,” Ralph hastened to say, soothingly. “You got\r\nlost in the woods, you remember; and then you had a nasty tumble;\r\nbut we’ve found you, and mean to take you straight home to your\r\nmother and father. I’m Ralph Jeffords, you know; I’ve often talked\r\nwith you at your house. So don’t worry any about it. How do you come\r\nout, Rob; is he hurt badly?”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad to tell you that there’s really nothing serious the\r\nmatter,” said the other, quickly, much to the delight of Tubby and\r\nthe others. “Now that he’s come-to in earnest, I think he’ll soon be\r\nhimself again. We’ll take turns carrying him; and on the way we can\r\nstop a bit at that spring we passed, for we ought to make him look\r\nmore presentable before handing him over to his mother. She’d nearly\r\nhave a fit if she saw his face all covered with dried blood like\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jeffords insisted on carrying the child for the first stretch,\r\nbut the boys would only consent on condition that he agreed to let\r\nthem take turns about. In fact, even Tubby declared it would not be\r\nfair to leave him out; and that he meant to have his share of the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the spring mentioned by Rob they halted for a\r\nbrief time. The child had by that time recovered from his stupor. He\r\nwhimpered a little when Rob with a wet handkerchief started to wash\r\nhis face and hands, for some of the scratches and bumps were\r\nevidently quite painful; but this task was soon finished, and the\r\nresult justified the scout leader’s judgment.\r\n\r\n“Oh! he looks all right now, for a fact,” said Sim. “I consider that\r\nwe were a lucky bunch all around to find him as neatly as we did.\r\nBut, then, where there’s a will there’s a way; and scouts have to\r\nlearn early in their career never to give up a thing they start on.”\r\n\r\nRalph made no comment on hearing his cousin say this; but there was\r\na gleam in his eye that pleased the observing Rob. The latter felt\r\npretty certain that his task of converting the unbeliever was going\r\nto be made much easier because of the strange event of that night.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer the home of Caleb, the boys felt a pleasurable\r\nanticipation. Remembering the anguish of the poor mother, they could\r\nrealize how she must suffer, and the thought of being able to bring\r\nher speedy relief gave them more or less satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWhen they appeared at the house some of the women discovered them,\r\nand must have called out the good news; for immediately a figure\r\ncame flying out of the building and straight toward the returning\r\ncompany. It was the frantic mother, wild to know if they had found\r\nher child, as well as the condition the little fellow was in.\r\n\r\nGreat must have been her joy when she heard Caleb calling to her,\r\nand she saw him reaching out toward her, even as he was held at the\r\ntime in Tubby’s arms. Well, each one of them felt that it was worth\r\nmany times the trouble they had taken, just to see the way Caleb’s\r\nmother hugged him to her heart. About that time it seemed as though\r\nTubby, yes, and all the other fellows as well, had to turn their\r\nheads away for some reason or other, and when they came together\r\nagain most of them were still violently winking.\r\n\r\nHow she tried to thank them all! When words failed her she actually\r\nkissed each one of the five boys. They would never forget that\r\noccasion; and as Rob afterwards said, it had been a great privilege\r\nto be able to bring such joy to a mother’s heart.\r\n\r\nNot wishing to wait after they had seen the father recalled from the\r\nsearch by means of a messenger sent out with the glad tidings, the\r\nboys entered their car, and with Mr. Jeffords started on the\r\nhomeward trip.\r\n\r\nIt seemed hard to believe that so much had been accomplished in such\r\na short interval. Why, only two hours before they had been laughing\r\nunconcernedly over the supper table, never dreaming that a sudden\r\nemergency would arise to claim their attention. Since then they had\r\nbeen through an experience few fellows ever have come their way.\r\n\r\nRob had spoken to Peleg more than once, but he noticed that Ralph\r\npaid no attention to the farm hand. It seemed that the other could\r\nnot dissuade himself from believing that Peleg must be guilty of\r\npilfering, and on this account he would not have anything more to do\r\nwith him than he could help; at least, until the mystery was cleared\r\nup.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Rob was feeling more confident than ever that when the\r\ntruth became known Peleg would be cleared of all suspicion; though\r\njust then he could not even guess how the other’s innocence was\r\ngoing to be made clear.\r\n\r\nThe boys sat down in the big sitting-room for an hour or so before\r\nthinking of going to bed. Mrs. Jeffords and the old aunty as well\r\nhad to hear all the thrilling particulars of the search, and its\r\nultimate conclusion. They also congratulated the scouts on their\r\nclever work, Mr. Jeffords describing how wonderfully Rob had\r\nfollowed the faint trail for several miles through the woods.\r\n\r\n“I want to say to you, boys,” the gentleman wound up with, “that my\r\nopinion of this scout business is undergoing a remarkable change.\r\nI’ve learned some wonderful things since you’ve come among us that\r\nhave opened my eyes considerably. I’m not saying anything more about\r\nit yet, but unless I miss my guess there will be another attempt at\r\nstarting a scout troop in Wyoming, and this time founded on the\r\nright principles.”\r\n\r\nThose words gave Rob great cheer. He never felt more pride in his\r\nkhaki uniform and his scout badge than when Mr. Jeffords thus\r\nfrankly acknowledged that he had been laboring under a false\r\nimpression concerning the benefit in a community a well drilled\r\nscout troop might prove to be.\r\n\r\nWhen upstairs in the big room, as Ralph was saying good-night to his\r\nfour guests, he allowed his hand to pass, affectionately, though\r\nperhaps unconsciously, along Rob’s khaki coat-sleeve, the\r\nsignificance of the action caused the wearer to smile with genuine\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Chapter XII\r\n\r\n                      How the Test Panned Out\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother day dawned.\r\n\r\nThe boys had laid out a number of plans for their enjoyment between\r\nsunrise and the coming of night. Ralph several times told them not\r\nto forget that they were booked for that run in to town after\r\nsupper, for he was bound to have them hear the “budding nightingale”\r\nthat Wyoming was so proud of, and who might some day make the name\r\nof the town famous.\r\n\r\nTubby coaxed Ralph to get up another fishing party. He wanted to\r\nhave one shy at those lively bass up in the lake. Andy Bowles, on\r\nthe other hand, took a notion to spend a little time with the frogs.\r\nHe admitted that he had grown suddenly fond of the delicacy, and,\r\nbesides, believed he would enjoy using that fine little Flobert gun.\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t lay in too big a stock, Andy,” Tubby warned him, as\r\nthey were setting off, “because you mustn’t forget we’re going to\r\nhave turtle steak and soup today. That ought to be feast enough for\r\nonce, I should think. Still, if you do get a mess of jumpers I’ll\r\nhelp you dispose of them.”\r\n\r\nThe fishing trip turned out very well, though possibly they did not\r\nget quite as many as on the previous day. Still, Tubby had the fun\r\nof actually taking the biggest prize of the day, a monster who\r\nnearly pulled him out of the boat by his sudden and vicious run\r\nafter snatching the live bait.\r\n\r\nBack again at the house they faced an afternoon to fill in with some\r\nother sort of “doings.” Ralph said he would have a few things to do\r\nup at his fur farm, and so Rob accompanied him, as did also Sim, the\r\nother two begging off as they claimed to be a bit tired.\r\n\r\n“I see Pete has been busy since our last visit!” remarked Ralph, as\r\nthey drew near the high board-fence, and came in sight of the cabin\r\nwhere the hired man lived while guarding the fur farm.\r\n\r\nFollowing his outstretched hand, they made a discovery. There,\r\nfastened upon the door of the cabin, was a fresh skin, evidently\r\ntaken lately, since it had not been there on their previous visit.\r\n\r\n“That ferocious wildcat, as sure as you live!” ejaculated Sim, in\r\nevident delight.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Pete got him, for a fact,” said Ralph. “I knew he would if\r\nanybody could do the job. Now my fur farm is safe again from danger.\r\nOne such cat can play hob with things; once they get a taste they’ll\r\ncome back again and again until they clean you out.”\r\n\r\nThe boys examined the skin of the wildcat. It was easy to see where\r\nPete had sent his bullet, for they found a ragged hole back of the\r\nright foreleg, showing that the hunter’s aim had been perfect. Pete,\r\ncoming up just then, was warmly congratulated by all of them over\r\nhis good luck. Ralph made him a present of five dollars on the spot.\r\n\r\n“Why, it was worth many times that to have this thief put out of the\r\nrunning!” he declared when the man showed an unwillingness to accept\r\nthe gift.\r\n\r\nSome further interesting information was gleaned while once more\r\nlooking over the big enclosure. This time they were fortunate enough\r\nto catch sight of a shy mink, though the animal quickly vanished\r\nunder a rock at their approach.\r\n\r\n“We’ll probably never know what sort of success we’re meeting with,”\r\nexplained the owner of the fur farm, “especially with regard to the\r\nmink and otter, until we decide to thin the animals out some day\r\ntoward Spring. Then by trapping a certain number, and leaving others\r\nto breed, we can tell whether the experiment pays or not. I’m not\r\nvery strong for it yet, but nothing ventured nothing gained, they\r\nsay; and I’m having lots of experience, anyway.”\r\n\r\nOnce more back home, they concluded to just “knock around,” as Tubby\r\ncalled it, until supper time. Ralph again reminded them that they\r\nwere billed for town later on, and would not return until well on\r\ntoward midnight, it might prove.\r\n\r\n“Step aside with me, will you, Rob?” he said in the ear of the scout\r\nleader.\r\n\r\nIt was about the middle of the afternoon. Tubby had gone with Andy\r\nover to the pond in order to settle some sort of dispute that had\r\narisen between them concerning the distance at which they had made\r\nsuccessful shots; while Sim chanced to be upstairs getting a letter\r\nwritten which he wished to mail that evening--some of them declared\r\nit was to his “best girl,” at which Sim had only smiled and winked,\r\nthough later on it proved to be addressed to his mother.\r\n\r\nWondering what Ralph had on foot to make him act so mysteriously,\r\nRob readily followed him, and presently they were out near the big\r\nbarns.\r\n\r\n“Now I’ve got you guessing on account of my being so mysterious,\r\nRob,” began the other, with a short laugh; “but the fact of the\r\nmatter is I just can’t get that affair out of my mind.”\r\n\r\n“Are you referring to Peleg’s case?” asked Rob.\r\n\r\n“Yes!” came the reply. “You see, I used to think highly of Peleg,\r\nand it hurts me to be keeping this suspicion against him. Rob, I\r\nkind of made up my mind to try him out, test him, as you might say.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that mightn’t be a bad idea, though pretty hard on Peleg,”\r\nadmitted Rob. “Still, it’s better to know the truth and have done\r\nwith it. What have you thought of trying so as to find out whether\r\nhe would be guilty of stealing or not?”\r\n\r\n“I feel a bit ashamed of doing such a thing, too,” confessed Ralph,\r\na red spot showing in his cheeks, “but let’s hope it turns out a\r\ngood thing for him. Listen, Rob. Here’s my pocketbook, you see?\r\nWell, it contains just eleven dollars, which I’m going to count\r\nbefore you, and mostly in small bills, at that. Now, I mean to drop\r\nthis where Peleg is bound to come across it, while we watch and see\r\nwhat he does. Are you game for that?”\r\n\r\nRob scratched his head, and made a grimace.\r\n\r\n“It does seem sort of cruel, to tell you the truth,” he said,\r\npresently; “but, after all, good may come of it. As I said before,\r\nbetter know the worst at once, and then either get rid of Peleg, or\r\nelse beg his pardon for suspecting him of being a thief. Yes, I’ll\r\ngo you in the game, Ralph. I know your intentions are of the right\r\nsort.”\r\n\r\nThey shook hands on that. Then Ralph proceeded to bait the trap by\r\ndropping the pocketbook in plain sight, where he said he knew Peleg\r\nPinder would soon be passing while carrying out his usual duties,\r\nwhich had to be attended to with clock-like fidelity on that farm\r\nwhere everything was run on schedule plans.\r\n\r\n“I’ve baited many a trap for wild animals before this,” Ralph\r\nfurther remarked, with a shrug of his shoulders that told of the\r\ndislike he had for the job, “but this is the first time I ever set\r\none for a human being. I hope it’ll be the last one. I don’t fancy\r\ndoing it at all.”\r\n\r\nSo they concealed themselves in a convenient place nearby, where\r\ntheir presence would never be suspected, and then waited to see what\r\nwould happen. Just as Ralph had figured, Peleg hove in sight within\r\nten minutes. He was carrying two buckets of something for the young\r\npigs that had to be fed so many times a day in order to cause them\r\nto grow fast.\r\n\r\nHe came to a sudden pause, and the buckets were set down violently.\r\nAnother second and Ralph gripped Rob’s shoulder as they saw the\r\nhired boy pounce upon the pocketbook with just the eagerness any one\r\nmight have shown.\r\n\r\nIt was a tense moment. Even Rob admitted that he held his breath\r\nwhile wondering what Peleg would do with his find. They saw him look\r\naround, as though wondering whether any one had noticed him pick it\r\nup. Rob almost feared that the boy would hasten to conceal the\r\npocketbook in his shirt, which would be pretty positive evidence\r\nthat he was tempted to keep it.\r\n\r\nThen he saw Peleg draw a long breath. Leaving the two buckets\r\nstanding there, the boy started on a run for the barns.\r\n\r\n“Now what’s he up to?” ventured Ralph, staring after the runner in\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t your father out there doing something?” asked Rob, giving\r\nPeleg the benefit of the doubt.\r\n\r\n“That’s a fact, he is,” admitted the other. “I wonder if Peleg means\r\nto hand him over my pocketbook. I forgot to tell you that he must\r\nknow I’m the owner, because it’s of a peculiar pattern, and he has\r\nseen me handle it many times.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll stay here a bit until the coast is clear, and then\r\ninvestigate, if that suits you, Ralph.”\r\n\r\nAfter a brief interval Peleg came back again and carried off the two\r\nbuckets of swill for the pigs. He did not look at all ruffled, or\r\nact as if he had any weighty secret on his mind, from which Rob took\r\nheart, and believed the boy had done the square thing.\r\n\r\n“Shall we look your father up now?” asked Rob, presently, when\r\nthings had settled down again to their accustomed calm.\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” his companion replied, “but I’m feeling a little\r\nshaky, to tell you the truth, Rob.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m not,” said the scout leader. “One thing about it, Ralph,\r\nyou don’t want your father to know you had deliberately dropped your\r\npocketbook so as to test Peleg, do you?”\r\n\r\n“By no means,” answered Ralph, hastily. “I understand what you’re\r\naiming at, too. So I’ll make out that I’ve missed my pocketbook and\r\nhave come out to see if I dropped it about the barns this morning.\r\nKind of mean to act that way; but you understand that I want to keep\r\nit from dad. If I’ve made a mistake about Peleg, it would be too bad\r\nto get him down on the boy.”\r\n\r\nSauntering around the big barns, they presently found Mr. Jeffords\r\nbusily engaged in mending some harness, a task he always took upon\r\nhimself, as he was quite expert along those lines. He glanced up and\r\nsmiled at their approach. Ralph forced a halfway anxious look upon\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n“Seen anything of my pocketbook, dad?” he asked.\r\n\r\nFor answer the other took it out of a rack above his head.\r\n\r\n“Peleg brought it to me a short time ago; said he had come upon it\r\non the path, and guessed it was yours, because no one else had a\r\npocketbook just like it. Better be a little more careful, son, of\r\nyour money; it doesn’t grow on bushes, you know,” and, having thus\r\nduly admonished his boy after the manner of parents generally, Mr.\r\nJeffords forgot all about the circumstance and commenced speaking of\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\nRob was satisfied that the little scheme was turning out just as he\r\nhoped, and that Peleg had not even been tempted to keep his find. He\r\nstill felt a little anxiety in connection with the outcome, and soon\r\ngave Ralph a signal that they had better withdraw to a spot where\r\nthe contents of the pocketbook could be examined.\r\n\r\nThis was easily managed, and soon afterwards the two boys entered\r\nRalph’s den at the barn, where they could have all the privacy they\r\nwished. It was with considerable interest that Rob saw the other\r\ntake out his pocketbook, and his fingers, trembling with eagerness,\r\ncommence to handle the wad of bills.\r\n\r\n“Well, how about it?” asked the scout leader, as Ralph looked up;\r\nbut really he need hardly have plied the question, for a burning\r\ncolor had rushed across the other’s face, as though he felt\r\nconscious of having wronged the one who was under suspicion.\r\n\r\n“It was just eleven dollars, I said, didn’t I, Rob? That amount is\r\nhere to a fraction, and I guess Peleg never even opened the\r\npocketbook, after all, but hurried as fast as he could to hand it\r\nover to dad. Well, I’m glad, and at the same time sorry that I did\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Chapter XIII\r\n\r\n                    When the Circus Came to Town\r\n\r\n\r\nRob felt something like relief, for although still strong in his\r\nbelief that Peleg was innocent of the charge hovering over his head,\r\nhe had felt a little anxious.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad to hear you say that, Ralph,” he remarked. “A thing like\r\nthis makes a good impression. Peleg has acted like any honest boy\r\nwould.”\r\n\r\n“Y--es, it would seem so,” the other went on to say, with a touch of\r\nhesitation in his speech. “I was just wondering if there could be a\r\nmethod in his madness. You see, for anything we know, he may have\r\nsuspected that the pocketbook had been purposely dropped as a trap;\r\nor even seen us hiding where we did, and on that account guessed\r\nwhat was doing.”\r\n\r\n“That thought never came to me,” Rob replied, looking grave. “While\r\nthere’s a chance that it might be so, I don’t believe it, Ralph. I\r\nthink you gave him a severe test, and that the boy came out of it\r\nwithout being scorched a whit. Still, if you have the least doubt\r\nleft, and I can’t blame you for it, either, keep tabs of Peleg, and\r\nprove the case, one way or the other.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I mean to, Rob. I don’t consider it’s quite fair to keep\r\nsuspecting a fellow and never openly accuse him. I own up this\r\naffair has upset some of my opinions. I’m more inclined than ever to\r\nbelieve I was mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s forget it for the present,” suggested Rob.\r\n\r\nTo this the other only too readily agreed, for Ralph was evidently a\r\nfair minded fellow, who believed in the good old motto of “live, and\r\nlet live.”\r\n\r\nSupper was to be at an unusually early hour because they meant to\r\nstart to town afterwards. The Southern “mammy” who served as cook\r\nevidently knew how to serve up “turtle fries” to equal anything a\r\nDelmonico could boast; at least, that was the verdict of the boys\r\nafter they had tasted the dish set before them.\r\n\r\nIt was noticed, however, that Tubby, the provider of the leading\r\narticle on the bill of fare, did not seem to care particularly for\r\nturtle; which seemed strange to some of the others, knowing his\r\ncustomary tastes as they did.\r\n\r\n“What ails you, Tubby?” demanded Sim. “Seems to me you only toy with\r\nthat helping on your plate. If you love frogs’ legs, and such things\r\nas spring chicken, you ought to just smack your lips over such a\r\ndish as this, fit for a crowned head.”\r\n\r\nTubby grinned as he went on to reply.\r\n\r\n“Oh! I don’t know, Sim, why it doesn’t seem to strike me just right.\r\nSomehow, I seem to don’t care for it as much as I thought I would.”\r\n\r\n“Why, it is the finest thing going,” urged Sim, “and here you act as\r\nif you thought it would jump right out of your plate at you!”\r\n\r\n“Please don’t say anything more, Sim,” requested Tubby, looking a\r\nbit pale. So the subject was dropped, though Tubby failed to take\r\nanother bite of his portion of “turtle fry.”\r\n\r\nRob had noticed how white the fat boy had suddenly turned while Sim\r\nwas teasing him. He immediately guessed what was the matter. He\r\nafterwards found out, just as he suspected, that Tubby, wanting to\r\nsee how everything was done, had stood around on the previous\r\nevening when Peleg carved the turtle into bits, after first removing\r\nthe double shell, always a difficult task.\r\n\r\nAs Rob well knew, there is often a strange species of muscle\r\ncontraction observed in the severed portions of a turtle or tortoise\r\nwhen recently killed, so that even pieces of the meat on the block\r\nwill jump in a most peculiar way. Tubby, doubtless, witnessed with\r\namazement this phenomenon as it was pointed out to him by Peleg, and\r\nsomehow the remembrance had taken away his desire to feast upon the\r\nunlucky owner of the shell.\r\n\r\nHowever, his normal appetite seemed to come back when the heaping\r\nplate of well-browned bass came on, for, taken in all, Tubby kept up\r\nwith the others in disposing of the second course.\r\n\r\nIt was just after supper, while the boys were sitting around on the\r\nbig porch resting a while before thinking of starting for town, that\r\nPeleg appeared. He approached the spot where it happened Ralph and\r\nRob were idly moving back and forth in one of those wide porch\r\nswings.\r\n\r\n“I wanted to ask you, Ralph, if you had any room in the car tonight\r\nto let me squeeze in, ’cause I happen to have some business to look\r\nafter in town that ought to be ’tended to. You see, I got a letter\r\nwhen the delivery man went through this mornin’ that says I had\r\nought to see a lawyer in Wyoming right away concerning somethin’\r\nthat I’ll tell you ’bout later on.”\r\n\r\nRalph nodded his head as though it would be quite agreeable to him.\r\n\r\n“Sure, Peleg, plenty of room,” he replied. “Car will hold seven\r\nwithout crowding, and with you there will be only six. We’ll be\r\nstarting in about fifteen minutes, so if you haven’t had supper,\r\nbetter be getting busy.”\r\n\r\nAfterwards he turned toward Rob and remarked:\r\n\r\n“Queer thing for Peleg to want to go into town at night; but then\r\nhe’s a pretty busy fellow all day long. I wonder if he did get a\r\nletter this afternoon when the rural delivery mail man came along in\r\nhis buggy?”\r\n\r\n“I saw him reading some sort of letter half an hour ago, so I\r\nimagine he did,” Rob told him, and the subject was dropped.\r\n\r\nThe patrol leader had noticed, however, that Peleg looked flushed\r\nmore than ordinarily at the time he asked permission to accompany\r\nthem to town. From this fact he imagined the boy had something on\r\nhis mind. Perhaps that letter had been from the sister who was\r\nliving in service some seven miles away in an opposite direction\r\nfrom Wyoming, and whom he did not often see. However, it was no\r\nbusiness of his who Peleg corresponded with, and so Rob put the\r\nmatter out of his mind.\r\n\r\nLater on the four boys jumped into the big old car as Ralph drew up\r\nin front of the farmhouse. Peleg, too, was ready, and found a place\r\non one of the extra movable seats. Rob again noticed that the boy\r\nseemed to be excited, though never speaking unless addressed.\r\nSeveral times he believed Peleg was chuckling to himself as if\r\nsecretly pleased; but, then, a trip to town after nightfall might be\r\na treat that excited his delight.\r\n\r\nWhen they finally had covered the distance separating the Jeffords’\r\nfarm from Wyoming, and put the car up at a convenient garage where\r\nit could be called for at any hour of the night, Peleg said he\r\nguessed he would move along.\r\n\r\n“We don’t know just when we’ll be starting back, Peleg,” Ralph\r\ncalled after him; “but better show up here by eleven at the latest,\r\nor you might get left.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I’ll be along before that,” confidently replied the other, as\r\nhe hurried away down the street.\r\n\r\nSim was chuckling as though secretly amused.\r\n\r\n“Now what has got hold of you, Sim, to keep making all those queer\r\nsounds like you do?” demanded Andy Bowles.\r\n\r\n“Oh! nothing much,” answered the disturber of the peace, “only I\r\nthink I can see through a mill-stone when there’s a hole in it. I\r\nwas thinking about Peleg’s asking to come with us. That letter\r\nbusiness may have only been a blind. The real cause you can hear, if\r\nyou listen right now.”\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s a band playing, as you live!” ejaculated Tubby.\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” laughed Ralph. “I forgot that this was the night the\r\ncircus was billed to strike Wyoming. It’s located on a vacant lot we\r\nhave to pass going toward the centre of the town. Come along, let’s\r\nstand around for a bit and see the sights. I always like to watch\r\nthe shouters get busy, and see the crowd of country yahoos gathering\r\naround. We’ve got a whole hour yet before the concert begins, boys.”\r\n\r\nWhat wideawake boy could ever resist the alluring attraction of a\r\ncircus band, with the added pleasure of listening to the various\r\nglib-tongued orators who so loudly describe the wonders to be seen\r\nin the side shows? Even Rob was perfectly willing to move along and\r\njoin the crowd surging in front of the round-top that occupied the\r\nbig vacant lot.\r\n\r\nMany lights abounded, strange sounds came from beyond the canvas\r\nwalls, and everything combined to throw an air of romantic interest\r\nabout the one-night stand of the Great Aggregation that had honored\r\nWyoming with its presence.\r\n\r\nSo the five boys stood and listened and laughed while the\r\nloud-voiced fakirs on the platforms bellowed their invitations to\r\n“step in and see the seven wonders of the world,” as shown in their\r\nside shows; while the busy ticket-taker in the circus wagon\r\ncontinued to sell pasteboard admissions to the big event, and people\r\ngradually sifted into the round-top for the evening performance.\r\n\r\n“There’s Peleg!” announced Sim, later on. “What did I tell you,\r\nfellows?”\r\n\r\nSure enough, Peleg was to be seen standing there, with a look of\r\nintense interest on his face, as though greatly amused by all this\r\nglitter and talk. The woman in spangles who handled an enormous\r\nsnake so fearlessly had the crowd gaping with awe; the pigmies from\r\nthe heart of Africa who sang such a quaint song and exhibited their\r\nwar trophies excited great interest; and the giant and dwarf\r\nappearing side by side on another platform caused quite a stampede\r\nin that direction when they pretended to engage in a boxing match.\r\n\r\nNo wonder then that Peleg could not resist stopping on his way, and\r\nstaring at those wonderful sights. It would be hard, indeed, to find\r\nany boy capable of passing by on the other side of the street, no\r\nmatter what his errand, without halting for at least a few minutes’\r\nsurvey and treat.\r\n\r\n“But you notice that he isn’t showing any signs of going inside,\r\ndon’t you?” Tubby was saying, turning to Sim. “Perhaps Peleg did\r\nhave some other sort of errand in town, just as he said. Stopping on\r\nhis way doesn’t signify anything, for we’re doing the same thing.”\r\n\r\nStill, Peleg was standing there when they once more resumed their\r\nstroll, that same entranced look on his freckled face; as though he\r\nmay have utterly forgotten the passage of time, and the fact of his\r\nhaving business to attend to in this unexpected treat of being\r\nbrought in touch with a traveling circus.\r\n\r\nRalph had several things he wanted his friends to see while in town.\r\nOf course, they might be trivial sights to these scouts, some of\r\nwhom had actually been across the ocean; traveled to Mexico, and\r\nvisited at the great Panama-Pacific Exposition on the Coast; but,\r\nthen, like most boys, he felt that it was up to him to do the honors\r\nto the best of his ability.\r\n\r\nSo Rob and the others looked upon the high school with its campus;\r\nheard about the doings of the football team, and the baseball nine\r\nthat represented Wyoming in the league; were shown the various mills\r\nand factories upon which the stability of Wyoming rested; and,\r\nfinally, along toward half-past seven, they started for the hall\r\nwhere the concert was to be given, and which happened to be in the\r\ncentre of the town.\r\n\r\nRob noticed that quite a lively wind had arisen. Some of the boys\r\nremarked that they were glad they had thought to “chuck” their\r\nsweaters in the car, for with such a high breeze in their faces they\r\nwould need them going home at a late hour. Mention is made of this\r\nbecause it afterwards turned out that this same strong wind had much\r\nto do with the fortunes of Wyoming before another day dawned.\r\n\r\nAs they passed along the main street of the town Rob saw Ralph\r\npointing to what seemed to be an abandoned frame building that had\r\nonce been a bustling hive of industry, though now deserted. It stood\r\nas a connecting link between the old part of the town and the newer\r\nsection where all those factories and mills lay.\r\n\r\n“Going to be pulled down soon, and another big mill built there,”\r\nRalph remarked, and then he added, turning to Rob: “Look, Rob,\r\nthere’s Peleg now, and going in that place!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Chapter XIV\r\n\r\n                          The Rising Wind\r\n\r\n\r\n“Then he didn’t go to the circus, after all,” remarked Tubby, as\r\nthough that one thought occupied his mind; truth to tell, had the\r\nstout scout been given his own choice in the matter, he might have\r\npreferred seeing the acrobats and the tightrope walkers under the\r\nbig round-top, rather than listen to the warblings of those who were\r\nto take part in the concert.\r\n\r\n“He seems to hesitate and look around him,” said Rob, meaningly, to\r\nRalph Jeffords. “What sort of a building is that, anyhow? It looks\r\nas though it might be given up to offices and shops.”\r\n\r\n“Just what the Handy Building is,” explained Ralph. “There are a lot\r\nof different business people represented there. Some people call it\r\nthe Arcade Building. You can see plenty of lights there, for most of\r\nthe offices keep open till ten o’clock at night. Among others I\r\nmight mention who occupy space in there, Rob, is one Hardman, a\r\ncurio dealer. I’ve been in his rooms lots of times when I had some\r\nmoney I felt like investing in old coins and foreign postage stamps\r\nfor my collection.”\r\n\r\n“Stamps!”\r\n\r\nRob only repeated the word after the other, but there was a world of\r\nmeaning connected with the way he did it. Like a flash there came to\r\nhim the remembrance of the loss Ralph had claimed to have suffered,\r\nwhen he failed to discover the several packets of valuable stamps\r\nwhere he believed he had left them, ready for mailing back to a city\r\ndealer from whom he had received them for making selections.\r\n\r\nCould it be possible that Peleg had yielded to some sudden\r\ntemptation, and purloined those packets? Was his errand to Wyoming\r\nreally to dispose of the stamps, after he had taken them from the\r\nsheets to which they had been slenderly attached?\r\n\r\nRob was conscious of a chilly feeling around the region of his heart\r\nas he continued to watch the boy standing there. It was not\r\ndifficult to imagine Peleg battling with the strong temptation. That\r\nmight account for his looking dubiously up at the building, and\r\nhesitating before taking a fatal step in wrong-doing.\r\n\r\n“Well, he’s gone in!” said Sim, presently. “I guess Peleg really had\r\nsome business in town, and didn’t mean to go to the show. I c’n see\r\nthat all sorts of people have offices in that building, lawyers,\r\ndoctors and even a curio dealer. Do we go on now, Ralph, or are you\r\nmeaning to wait for Peleg?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! we’re going on, all right, Sim; Peleg said nothing about\r\nwanting to attend the entertainment. Perhaps, after he’s through\r\nwith his _important business_ here he may drift back to the circus\r\nlot. That would be more in his line, I guess. Come on.”\r\n\r\n“What were those packets of stamps worth, Ralph?” Rob managed to ask\r\nwithout being overheard by any of the others, for Tubby and Andy\r\nchanced to be engaged in a little dispute concerning something that\r\nhad arisen, as with Sim they trudged along ten feet or so in the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\n“Something like fifteen dollars, I should say,” replied the other,\r\ngloomily.\r\n\r\nRob knew that it was not so much the value of the missing packets\r\nthat bothered Ralph Jeffords as the fact that a boy to whom his\r\nfather had been so kind had apparently betrayed a trust, and stolen\r\nfrom the son of his benefactor.\r\n\r\n“And you think Peleg has been pretty keen on making money, do you?”\r\ncontinued the scout leader.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s a fact,” he was told, moodily. “I never knew a fellow\r\nmore eager to scrape cents and dollars together. He would do any\r\nkind of extra work after hours if only he could make ten cents by\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“But you wouldn’t call him a money-lover, or a miser, would you?”\r\nqueried Rob.\r\n\r\n“That was what I thought at first, and I didn’t like it one bit,”\r\nRalph explained, frankly. “So I mentioned the matter to Peleg one\r\ntime. He told me that he was the oldest of the children left by his\r\nfather when he died. One sister just younger than Peleg works for a\r\nfamily not a great many miles away from here. The others, three of\r\nthem, are in an orphan asylum, you know. Well, would you believe it,\r\nPeleg told me he had an ambition to get enough money together,\r\nsomehow, to sooner or later have an humble home, where all the\r\nPinder children might live together!”\r\n\r\nRob caught his breath.\r\n\r\n“That was a noble resolution for Peleg, wasn’t it?” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“I believed so,” replied Ralph, disconsolately. “It made me think a\r\nheap of the boy, and I tried every way I could to encourage him.\r\nThat’s what makes it cut me so hard now, to suspect that he could\r\nsteal from me.”\r\n\r\nSomehow, what he had heard seemed to encourage Rob more than ever in\r\nhis belief that Peleg must be innocent. The circumstances all seemed\r\nto point strongly toward his being guilty; but Rob plucked up fresh\r\nhope after learning what a splendid excuse the boy had given for\r\nscrimping, and saving every cent he could gather together.\r\n\r\nIn imagination Rob could even see the happy faces of the little\r\nPinders when they eventually found themselves under a roof of their\r\nown, if such happiness was indeed ever going to come their way.\r\nBrave, loyal, brotherly Peleg, how few boys would have dreamed such\r\ndreams as came to him at night, and visions by day?\r\n\r\n“Oh! it doesn’t seem possible that he could be guilty of doing such\r\na mean thing as taking your stamps, Ralph,” he told the other.\r\n\r\nSomehow, even the confidence Rob had in the boy who was under\r\nsuspicion seemed to make Ralph Jeffords feel better.\r\n\r\n“Your saying that does you credit, Rob,” he told his new friend;\r\n“and because of the faith you seem to feel in him, I’m going to try\r\nagain and believe Peleg innocent. But, all the same, that won’t\r\nprevent me from finding out the truth.”\r\n\r\n“No, you owe that much to Peleg,” admitted Rob. “One way or the\r\nother, you’ve got to learn the answer to this puzzle. How will you\r\ngo about it?”\r\n\r\n“There’s one way that might tell the story,” confided Ralph. “I can\r\ncome down to town tomorrow morning on some errand, and take occasion\r\nto drop in at the Arcade.”\r\n\r\n“You mean to see the curio dealer, and put a few questions to him;\r\nis that the programme, Ralph?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. He knows me very well, and would keep my secret,” continued\r\nthe other, as he sighed heavily, evidently anticipating the worst.\r\n“I’d have the money with me to buy them back if Peleg did sell them,\r\nbecause I wouldn’t want Mr. Hardman to have the boy arrested as a\r\nthief. That would leave it all in my hands. I’d have to consult my\r\nfather before I decided what I finally ought to do in the matter.”\r\n\r\n“Well, something may happen between now and tomorrow to change your\r\nplans. For instance, you may even possibly discover the stamps\r\nsomewhere. I’ve hidden things myself, and for a short time forgotten\r\nwhere I put them. Then somebody else may have taken them, not to\r\nsteal them, it might be. Oh! there are lots of loopholes through\r\nwhich they could have passed. And after you’ve learned the truth\r\nyou’re surprised to find how easy it was to misjudge any one.”\r\n\r\n“But what else would take Peleg in there?”\r\n\r\n“I confess I couldn’t give even a guess,” admitted the scout leader;\r\n“but he said there was some news in that letter he received that\r\nmade him want to come to town. For all we know, it might have\r\nsomething to do with the sister who is in service, or even the three\r\nsmaller children in the asylum. Poor Peleg has been dreaming of\r\ndoing great things, you know, Ralph.”\r\n\r\n“You are certainly the grandest fellow to stand by any one who is\r\ndown I ever met!”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I don’t know that I’m different from any scout who wears the\r\nkhaki, and has taken the scout oath to try and be useful to others.\r\nYou’d do just as much if you had the chance, and I know it, Ralph.\r\nBut suppose we drop Peleg for the time being, and speak of something\r\nelse? The other fellows must be wondering why we keep our heads\r\ntogether so long, and talk in undertones.”\r\n\r\n“I’m agreeable, Rob. Notice how the wind has commenced to rise. It\r\nwas quiet when we left home, and now you can hear it rustling\r\nthrough the trees at a great rate. Do you think it’s going to\r\nstorm?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t happen to be the weather sharp of the troop,” laughed Rob,\r\n“so you mustn’t depend too much on my prediction.”\r\n\r\nHe looked up at the sky, and then around him, after which he\r\nventured to say:\r\n\r\n“I think there will be quite a blow during the night, for those\r\nclouds are passing over in a hurry; but it isn’t likely we’ll have\r\nto go home in a rainstorm.”\r\n\r\nApparently, the other trio must have also been paying attention to\r\nthe rising wind, for just then Tubby called out:\r\n\r\n“Hope you’ve got a gilt-edged fire department in your town, Ralph.\r\nIf a fire _did_ happen to break out tonight, with this breeze going,\r\nit would likely eat up a few of your buildings. How about it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, we’ve got a pretty good fire department, such as you are apt\r\nto find in towns of this size,” replied the other, seriously. “It’s\r\npartly a volunteer one, of course, and they’ve got quite a few\r\nmedals won in State rivalries, competing with other companies. Fact\r\nis, we’re a bit proud of the Wyoming Fire Department. They can smash\r\nwindows faster, and get a hose up to a burning house five seconds\r\nquicker than the best of them.”\r\n\r\nAll of the boys laughed at hearing Ralph say this.\r\n\r\n“Whee!” exclaimed Tubby, “I wouldn’t like to be under that old\r\ncircus tent if a big storm did come swooping along. I guess it’d go\r\nflying over the mountain-tops like a kite.”\r\n\r\n“I was in a circus once when we had a terrific storm,” admitted\r\nRalph. “I’ll never forget the way the frightened people behaved. The\r\ncanvas flapped wildly, and made the most terrifying noises going. We\r\nexpected to have the whole business come down about our ears any\r\nminute, but fortunately the wind passed over, and the animals quit\r\nhowling so that the people could quiet the youngsters. It was\r\nsomething awful while it lasted.”\r\n\r\n“Are we going inside the hall now?” asked Andy, who had grown tired\r\nof walking around the town seeing the “sights”; for while these may\r\nhave amounted to something in Ralph’s estimation, they were very\r\ncommon in the eyes of fellows who had done so much traveling, and\r\nhad even seen considerable of the war in Europe, as well as the\r\nwonders of New York City.\r\n\r\n“We might as well, because it’s getting close to the time for the\r\nperformance to begin,” the guide replied.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be a good many people all moving in the same general\r\ndirection as themselves. These were, doubtless, the holders of\r\ntickets to the entertainment that had been the magnet drawing them\r\nto town on this particular night fated to be set down with a red\r\nmark in the history of Wyoming.\r\n\r\nPresently they joined the line before the door of the hall in which\r\nthe concert was to be held. Apparently it was bound to be a popular\r\naffair. Ralph privately informed his mates that most of the people\r\nwere coming just to hear the little girl with the Patti-like voice.\r\nIn this way he aroused their curiosity to a high pitch; though none\r\nof them claimed to be fine judges of operatic music, or able to\r\ndecide the exact quality of a wonderful voice, still they knew good\r\nsinging, and were considerably interested in what Ralph had told\r\nthem of the girl who was leading the printed programme as Anna\r\nBurgoyne.\r\n\r\n“Her father was connected with the opera over across the water years\r\nago,” explained Ralph. “Her mother, too, used to sing in public, so\r\nyou see Anna comes by her wonderful voice honestly. But just you\r\nwait and see, that’s all.”\r\n\r\nThey found the hall already well filled with an audience that\r\ncounted as most of the people worth while in and around Wyoming;\r\nthough the circus doubtless served to attract quite a crowd, as it\r\nalways does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Chapter XV\r\n\r\n                     The Clang of the Fire Bell\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hall continued to fill up, until there was standing room only by\r\nthe time the performance began. The boys were interested in the\r\npeople around them, for Ralph was able to relate certain things of\r\ninterest connected with some of those he pointed out.\r\n\r\nAll at once Tubby exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Well, we made a big mistake, after all, about him!”\r\n\r\n“Who are you referring to, Tubby?” asked Sim, who sat next the fat\r\nscout.\r\n\r\n“Why, just turn your head this way, and glance over yonder near the\r\ndoor among the latecomers. Strike you that you know anybody in that\r\nbunch?” chuckled Tubby.\r\n\r\n“Say, it is Peleg, after all!” admitted Sim. “I was dead sure the\r\ncircus would do for him, and here he bobs up at the concert. Do you\r\nsuppose it’s because we just happened to be coming here, and he knew\r\nit, Ralph?”\r\n\r\nRalph and Rob had discovered the farm boy by then.\r\n\r\n“Oh! I don’t know about that,” said the former, looking both\r\nsurprised and puzzled. “I believe I’ve heard Peleg say more than\r\nonce he liked music, and singing especially. That was when he told\r\nme one of his little sisters could warble like a bird, and some day\r\nshe might show people the Pinders weren’t such good-for-nothing\r\ntrash, after all. That’s what has been worrying Peleg all along, the\r\nway folks looked down on his father and the children after the\r\nmother died, years ago.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he looks as if he was glad to even find standing room\r\ntonight,” suggested Andy. “You can see a regular grin on his face\r\naway from over here. Peleg certainly seems happier than I’ve known\r\nhim to be since we first met him. It doesn’t require much to please\r\nsome fellows, I take it.”\r\n\r\nRob looked at Ralph, and found the other observing him intently.\r\nBoth of them were wondering whether the visit Peleg had made to the\r\nold curio dealer could account for that broad smile on his face.\r\nIndeed, an observer, if he had been a boy, would have said that\r\nPeleg every once in so often looked as though he wanted to “shake\r\nhands with himself,” he felt so happy.\r\n\r\nThe announcement that the entertainment was about to commence drew\r\nthe attention of the five lads from Peleg Pinder. When Tubby\r\nhappened to glance in that quarter again later on, he could not\r\nplace the other, for, the rear of the hall being densely packed with\r\nthe late-comers, it was difficult to make out any individual person.\r\n\r\nThere were some ordinary numbers at first, a fair quartette that\r\nprovoked a certain amount of applause, then a banjo solo that quite\r\nexcited Tubby, who secretly aspired to some day to play such a\r\nsplendid instrument.\r\n\r\nAfter that some other exercises came along, but it was evident that\r\nthe audience as a whole was waiting for the crowning event of the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n“Now she’s coming, so get ready, fellows!” said Andy Bowles,\r\nreferring to his programme.\r\n\r\nThere was a little wait. Ralph craned his neck, looking around to\r\nnod to a number of people he knew; but Rob really believed the other\r\nwas thinking of Peleg more than anything else just then. To prove\r\nthis he whispered:\r\n\r\n“Don’t see anything of him, do you, Ralph?”\r\n\r\n“That’s a fact,” came the ready reply; “he’s lost in the shuffle,\r\nfor there’s a big mob back there, pushing to get inside the hall in\r\ntime to hear Anna Burgoyne. I tell you she’s getting folks up in\r\nthis neck of the woods excited a heap. But you just wait and see,\r\nthat’s all.”\r\n\r\nThen there broke out a wild hand-clapping and stamping of feet. Rob\r\nsaw a demure little girl standing there, blushing and bowing as she\r\nfaced the big audience.\r\n\r\n“Why, she’s hardly more than a child!” gasped Tubby, as the noise\r\ngradually died away, with the singer standing there wholly at her\r\nease.\r\n\r\n“Well, she isn’t thirteen yet,” admitted Ralph, “which makes it all\r\nthe more wonderful. Oh! she’s a nightingale, all right, believe me.\r\nI think she’s got the sweetest and strongest voice of any one I ever\r\nheard, and, let me tell you, I’ve been down to New York and attended\r\nmore than a few first class concerts, too.”\r\n\r\nSilence fell upon the crowd. Every eye was fastened on the demure\r\nlittle figure of Anna Burgoyne. Every one almost in that big hall\r\nhad heard her sing time and again, but it seemed as though they\r\ncould never get enough of her wonderful voice. Most of them believed\r\nlike Ralph, that some fine day little Anna was bound to put Wyoming\r\non the map through the marvelous voice Nature had given her. Already\r\nsome of the rich men of the town had settled it among themselves\r\nthat later on she must be sent to Europe, when the dreadful war was\r\nover, in order to have the highest artists of the Old World train\r\nher voice. Nothing was to be too good for Anna Burgoyne. Already\r\nthey could in imagination see her charming the world of music\r\nlovers, and incidentally making the little Adirondack town of\r\nWyoming known far and wide.\r\n\r\nRob understood that the child did have a most wonderful voice as\r\nsoon as he heard her commence to sing. He, too, was thrilled with\r\nthe purity of her tones as well as by their sweetness and power. Of\r\ncourse, he knew that she was almost wholly untrained, but in time,\r\nunless something happened to injure her vocal chords, she would very\r\nlikely fulfill all the predictions of her admiring Wyoming friends.\r\n\r\nA storm of applause followed the completion of her selection, in\r\nwhich all of the boys heartily joined. Then came another song, and\r\nstill a third. It seemed as if the audience had gone crazy over that\r\nmite of a girl, and would insist on her complying with their demands\r\nuntil she could no longer sing a note.\r\n\r\nFinally, as the only way to still the tempest, the manager of the\r\nentertainment appeared on the stage to tell the cheering people that\r\nAnna Burgoyne would oblige them once more later on in the evening,\r\nsince they would find her name there for further efforts.\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you think now?” asked Ralph, glowing with pride over\r\nthe achievement of the town pet.\r\n\r\n“She’s bound to make a name for herself, all right,” admitted Rob.\r\n\r\n“I never heard anything like it,” said Tubby, looking so pleased\r\nthat his cheeks stuck out like twin rosy apples. “Why, I could sit\r\nfor hours and hear that girl sing. She’s certainly a wonder, Ralph.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how they can bear to let her go away to Europe,”\r\nobserved Andy, whom Rob had actually seen slily wipe his eyes with\r\nthe back of his hand while the singer was in the midst of a pathetic\r\nlittle ballad.\r\n\r\n“Say, just listen to that wind making things hum outside, will you?”\r\npractical Sim was saying about that time. “I do believe it’s growing\r\nworse right along. I hope it doesn’t blow us into a ditch when we’re\r\nheading for home. That old carryall of yours is big enough to catch\r\nthe wind full smack, Ralph.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry about that, Sim,” retorted the other. “I’ve been in all\r\nsorts of weather with that auto, and she stands up before it like\r\neverything. Chances are five to one we’ll get back home safe and\r\nsound. I only hope you will all feel that it’s paid you to come in\r\nwith me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! that goes without saying, Ralph. We’ve had a bully time\r\nalready; and there’s going to be more of that singing, you know,”\r\nTubby assured him. “There’s Peleg now, sitting up on that railing\r\nback of the hall, along with some other fellows. Not a bad place to\r\nbe in, because no tall woman with a head of hair as big as a bushel\r\nbasket can intercept your view of the stage.”\r\n\r\nTubby had the wisdom to lower his voice to a whisper while saying\r\nthe latter part of this, because the lady to whom he evidently\r\nreferred was apt to hear him unless he exercised great care; and one\r\nglimpse Tubby had had of her determined face had made him decide\r\nthat he had better not excite her ire if he knew what was good for\r\nhis health.\r\n\r\nRob looked and could also see Peleg. The Pinder boy seemed to be\r\nenjoying his evening at the entertainment hugely, for his face was\r\nstill wreathed in smiles. Apparently his trip to town had been of a\r\nsatisfactory nature, Rob thought.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the affair now started in, and once more the\r\naudience listened to what the programme provided. Though they\r\napplauded everything, it could easily be seen that they knew just\r\nwhen to stop in order not to induce any of the other local\r\nperformers to believe the hand-clapping was meant as an encore.\r\n\r\nFinally there was Anna Burgoyne again, bowing, while a storm of\r\nsounds arose so that for several minutes she was utterly unable to\r\nproceed. When this had gone on long enough, according to the\r\nmanager, he must have made some motion which the girl had been\r\nawaiting.\r\n\r\nThe lady at the piano struck a chord, and as if by magic all that\r\nhand-clapping and stamping ceased. The change was simply marvelous,\r\nand, save for the clear notes of the instrument, and perhaps the\r\nrattling of a few windows under the influence of the unruly wind,\r\nsilence had fallen upon the big hall.\r\n\r\nThen the girl commenced to sing again. Rob liked her voice better\r\nthan ever, now that he heard it under different conditions. He was\r\nglad he had been asked to come to town by Ralph; glad of the\r\nopportunity to hear such splendid music, and find himself face to\r\nface with such a little song witch.\r\n\r\nHardly had the last note died away than they gave her a whirlwind of\r\napprobation. Why, the very floor seemed to quiver under the thunder\r\nof sound; and all intended to inform that slender slip of a girl how\r\nmuch they thought of her vocal efforts. Surely there was only one\r\nAnna Burgoyne, and she belonged to Wyoming in the Adirondacks.\r\n\r\nThen, in time, they allowed her to sing to them again. If anything,\r\nthis last song won their hearts more than all that had gone before.\r\nA third time she had to come from behind the scenes, for they would\r\nnot allow the programme to proceed. This time she bowed, and smiled,\r\nand shook her head; but the same tumult broke out after she had\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n“They act as though they could almost eat her up!” Tubby was saying,\r\nlaughingly, all the while pounding his fat palms together, and\r\nmaking considerable addition to the general din.\r\n\r\nAfter this had gone on for some time without any apparent sign of a\r\nbreak, once more the girl appeared, looking flushed and happy. She\r\nshook her head, and held up her hands as if to beg them to have\r\nmercy on her. In spite of all, Rob believed she would be obliged to\r\nsing just once more, though he knew she must be tired from her\r\nexertions.\r\n\r\nSomething came about that changed things almost in a breath,\r\nsomething that caused the crowd gathered there to think of other\r\nthings besides music and promising girl singer with a grand future\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\nRob felt a sudden thrill pass through him as he caught a brazen note\r\njust when the tumult in the hall had died away, and the lady at the\r\npiano was beginning to strike up an accompaniment.\r\n\r\n“Is that the fire alarm bell?” he asked Ralph, hastily.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s what!” exclaimed the other.\r\n\r\nThe sound must have struck a note of alarm at many hearts in that\r\ngathering, for they could easily guess how a fire, with such a gale\r\nblowing, might imperil the whole town. Men could be seen jumping\r\nhastily from their seats, possibly some of them volunteer firemen,\r\nwhose duty called them to leave their beds or the banquet hall when\r\nthe call came, regardless of conditions or circumstances.\r\n\r\nTheir pushing through the crowd at the door was the signal for a\r\nrush; and in the excitement of that moment even the popular little\r\nAnna Burgoyne was temporarily forgotten in the desire to get outside\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Chapter XVI\r\n\r\n                        Fighting the Flames\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hadn’t we better follow the crowd, and get out of here, Ralph?”\r\nasked Rob, when he found the sudden alarm of fire had broken up the\r\nentertainment, and that even little Anna Burgoyne had taken\r\nadvantage of the diversion to slip back off the stage again.\r\n\r\n“I suppose we might as well,” grumbled Ralph, “because she’s gone,\r\nand there won’t be any more singing tonight.”\r\n\r\nThe five boys started toward the door, where quite a jam had\r\noccurred, as many of the excited audience tried to push through at\r\nthe same time. In consequence there was a blockade, and it would\r\ntake a long time for those in the rear to emerge from the hall.\r\n\r\n“Too slow for me,” ventured Andy. “Say, Ralph, couldn’t we get out\r\nby way of one of these windows?”\r\n\r\n“Let’s look and see,” added Sim.\r\n\r\nInvestigation proved the plan feasible. The ground was fourteen feet\r\nor so below them, but there was a shed of some sort, on to which\r\nroof they could readily pass from the window of the second-story\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nRalph led the way, because he belonged to Wyoming, and really the\r\npilot of the party, chauffeur and all that. After him came Rob,\r\nwhile the other three followed in turn, Tubby, as usual, bringing up\r\nthe rear with credit, and a super-abundance of material.\r\n\r\n“Careful you don’t slip and slide off this shed roof,” advised Ralph\r\nas he cautiously moved along, intending to hang from the lower end\r\nand drop to the ground.\r\n\r\nTubby came near having trouble when his feet slipped; but Andy\r\nmanaged to catch hold of the one in danger, and steadied him until\r\nhe could get another footing. Then one by one they lowered\r\nthemselves and dropped. Even Tubby succeeded in making a safe\r\nretreat from the building. People were still emerging by twos and\r\nthrees from the exit of the hall as they hurried past. Evidently\r\nthey might have been kept shut up there for half an hour, losing\r\nmuch worth seeing, had they been content to accept things as they\r\ncame, and never trying to escape by way of that window.\r\n\r\n“Which way now?” bellowed Andy.\r\n\r\n“Leave that to Ralph; he knows how the land lies!” Rob suggested.\r\n\r\n“Yes, follow me, everybody!” the party indicated called over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nAway they hastened along the street, where people were already\r\nhurrying in squads and singly, all heading in a certain direction as\r\nthough word had been passed along the line concerning the location\r\nof the fire.\r\n\r\n“You see, it’s in the poorer section of the town,” Ralph was telling\r\nRob, as they ran along side by side. “There goes another fire\r\nengine; and I suppose the chemical crowd have already started work\r\non the fire, because they can get going so much faster than the\r\nothers. Listen to the shouting, will you? That sounds as if Wyoming\r\nhad been waked up, I guess.”\r\n\r\nRob was already alarmed, and with reason. He could see from the\r\nglare in the heavens that the fire was dead ahead of them; indeed,\r\nseveral times they had glimpsed flames shooting madly upwards. Rob\r\nremembered that they were facing the wind almost head on, which\r\nwould mean that the conflagration must be swept on its breath\r\ndirectly toward the mill and factory part of the town.\r\n\r\nGreat excitement reigned all around them, and this was growing more\r\nintense as each dozen seconds flitted past. People began to realize\r\nthat an awful calamity actually threatened their fine little town,\r\nand that unless the firemen were unusually successful in confining\r\nthe blaze to a few houses, there was a chance of a catastrophe that\r\nwould wipe out the better part of the entire community, and render\r\nmany families homeless, as well as depriving hundreds of their daily\r\ntasks if the mills and factories went up in smoke.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the fire department would do everything possible to save\r\nthe town, but, after all, they were a feeble force to try and stand\r\nin the way of that leaping blaze when fanned and whipped by a\r\nfurious wind.\r\n\r\nThe five boys had come in to attend an entertainment, but it began\r\nto look as if they might be on hand to witness a most distressing\r\ncatastrophe. Rob was trying to think what they could do to help save\r\nthe town, should the fire actually get beyond the frantic efforts of\r\nthe few firemen with their feeble apparatus. He was only too willing\r\nto do anything that lay in his power to render assistance; but just\r\nthen, despite his utmost efforts, no scheme appealed to him.\r\n\r\nMany there were who would be glad to help as best they could; but it\r\nis disheartening to find how little can be done under such\r\nconditions. The fire had already taken such a fierce hold that the\r\nchances of successfully fighting it and saving the rest of the town\r\nseemed slim, indeed.\r\n\r\n“There, they’ve got the water started on it!” called out Andy, who\r\nhad sight that enabled him to see things others were less able to\r\ncatch. “Two streams are getting busy, it seems. Good for those\r\nfiremen; they know their business, all right. But, say, the flames\r\njust seem to laugh at all they can do. Look there the way they keep\r\non shooting up like they were trying to lick the clouds!”\r\n\r\nIt was indeed an impressive sight. The fire demon was hard at work\r\ntrying to defy all efforts at putting the flames down. By the red\r\nlight of the conflagration the crowd that was quickly gathering,\r\nrunning this way and that in excitement, had a peculiar look to Rob,\r\nwho likened them to Indians minus their feathers and other war\r\nparaphernalia.\r\n\r\n“There, it’s gone and done it now!” shrilled a boy nearby; “see, the\r\nlumber yard has caught fire. Gee! look at it going like soap, will\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nIt was only too true. Instead of the fire being stemmed, it appeared\r\nto be making giant strides, and extending right and left, as well as\r\nsweeping onward with that furious wind.\r\n\r\nAlready cries of terror were arising. Some of the people who chanced\r\nto live at the further end of the town beyond the mills and\r\nfactories started on a run for their homes, doubtless with the one\r\nthought of getting as much of their household possessions to a place\r\nof safety as possible before the greedy flames swept a swathe of\r\ndestruction across that region.\r\n\r\nRob had seen pictures representing a panic, but here was the real\r\nthing. While some of the mob stood there and stared as though they\r\ndid not mean to miss a single feature of the burning up of the town,\r\nothers were wringing their hands and shrieking in terror as they ran\r\nthis way and that, hardly knowing what they were about.\r\n\r\nIt was really difficult to talk while all these noises were going\r\non. Rob had to place his lips quite close to the ear of Ralph when\r\nhe spoke.\r\n\r\n“The wind is carrying things before it, you see, Ralph!” he called\r\nout. “Unless I miss my guess, it’s heading straight toward the\r\nmills.”\r\n\r\n“Just what it is,” admitted the other, looking completely unnerved.\r\n“If there comes a sudden and lucky shift to that breeze it’s\r\ngood-bye to all of Wyoming--mills, dwelling houses and everything.\r\nYou see, it’s got something to feed on right along, from the\r\ncottages where it’s working now, to the factories. It’s eating its\r\nway just like a train of wet powder will do when you touch a match\r\nto the same, sizzling along until it reaches the end. And the worst\r\nof it is nothing can be done to halt its triumphant march, nothing\r\nthat I can see.”\r\n\r\nIt was plain that Ralph was disheartened by the prospect confronting\r\nthe enterprising little town. He took a great interest in Wyoming,\r\nand the impending catastrophe appalled him.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t there something we could do to help these poor people get\r\ntheir stuff out of reach of the flames, even if we can’t stop the\r\nfire raging?” asked Tubby, whose tender heart was always ready to\r\nbleed for any sufferer, no matter what his race, color or condition.\r\n\r\nThere were wagons backing up to the pavements, and people hurriedly\r\nmaking trips back and forth between the houses and the curb,\r\ncarrying what they treasured most in their limited possessions. It\r\nwas a most pitiable sight, and one those boys were not likely to\r\nforget for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe idea took hold of them, and they started to work, lending a\r\nhelping hand to a number of the panic-stricken families along the\r\nstreet. Meanwhile the fire was eating its way gradually along. Rob\r\ntried to figure how long at this rate of progress it would take for\r\nit to jump across to the other side of the town, and start devouring\r\nthose splendid mills, and the machine shops, where scores and\r\nhundreds of people were accustomed to earn their daily wage.\r\n\r\n“An hour at the most, and it will be good-night to the place,\r\nperhaps in a whole not less time than that,” he told himself; and\r\nthere was something akin to awe in the thought that man appeared to\r\nbe so utterly helpless to engage in a combat with the allied\r\nelements of wind and fire, once they took the bits in their teeth,\r\nand started to destroy all in their path.\r\n\r\nEven where the boys were working so like beavers they could hear the\r\nangry snap and crackle of the leaping flames. To Rob it seemed as\r\nthough they were actually laughing in derision at the futility of\r\nthe crafty brain of man to stay their onward progress.\r\n\r\nIf he could only devise some way to beat them at their own game--how\r\nRob cudgeled his wits to try and think of some such scheme, but\r\nsomehow the things that appealed to him seemed so silly and foolish\r\nwhen pitted against such a roaring windswept mass of raging fire.\r\n\r\nRob had seen a forest ablaze, and knew more or less how the men who\r\nwatch the Government-owned lands are taught to act when face to face\r\nwith such a calamity. But the tactics that might be successful under\r\nsuch conditions were useless here in town. It was folly to dream of\r\ndigging a trench over which the fire could not pass; and equally\r\nuseless to think of starting a small fire ahead that could be\r\ncontrolled, so that when the main conflagration came to such a point\r\nit would find nothing to feed upon.\r\n\r\nAll this went on while the boys were working as hard as they could.\r\nWherever they found a chance to lend a hand they pitched in with\r\ntheir accustomed vim; more than a few poor families had occasion to\r\nremember those sturdy and accommodating young fellows wearing the\r\nkhaki uniforms, who assisted them to load the wagons, and then get a\r\nflying start for a point of safety.\r\n\r\nRob was beginning to feel a sense of despair as he wrestled in vain\r\nwith the perplexing problem of how to successfully fight that volume\r\nof flame eating its way remorselessly toward the section of the town\r\nwhere so much of the community’s prosperity was laid up.\r\n\r\nThen, like an inspiration, something came to him. It almost took his\r\nbreath away, such was the wonderful nature of the idea. It was no\r\nnew invention of his, but something he remembered reading when a\r\ncity had been threatened with destruction, and the resourceful fire\r\nfighters were compelled to take stern measures in order to check the\r\nonrushing flames.\r\n\r\nHe looked around. Ralph fortunately was not far away, staggering\r\nunder a trunk belonging to some poor woman who had been given a\r\nchance to place it upon a partly loaded wagon. Rob ran in that\r\ndirection. His appearance before Ralph gave the other a new thrill,\r\nfor he immediately saw from the excited look on the scout leader’s\r\nearnest face that Rob had struck a feasible idea at last.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got it!” cried Rob, as he seized upon the other; “come with me\r\nas fast as you can, and as we run I’ll tell you my plan. It’s a\r\ndesperate chance, but with the help of Heaven we may save the town\r\nyet,” and so they started off as fast as their already tired\r\ncondition would allow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Chapter XVII\r\n\r\n                      A Wild Race Against Time\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two boys had hardly made a start when they found Sim, Andy, and\r\neven Tubby trotting along at their side, and naturally overwhelmed\r\nwith astonishment at the singular action of the pair.\r\n\r\n“Hey! what’s all this mean?” cried Sim.\r\n\r\n“Where are you heading for?” exclaimed Andy; while Tubby was\r\ngasping:\r\n\r\n“My stars! is it as bad as _this_, and do we have to run for our\r\nlives? Will the mills blow up like magazines, Rob, and send\r\neverything sky-high?”\r\n\r\n“Listen!” snapped Ralph. “Rob here’s got a scheme. He’s asked me to\r\ngo along with him and help out. Now tell us, Rob, what it’s all\r\nabout?”\r\n\r\n“We must get the car out, you and I, Ralph, and make for your place\r\nlike the wind. Don’t you understand, it’s that dynamite your\r\nfather’s got stored there, together with the battery for exploding\r\nthe same, that we’ve got to have.”\r\n\r\n“What, dynamite? Haven’t we got fire enough as it is without trying\r\nto blow up the poor old town?” cried the amazed Andy.\r\n\r\n“You don’t get on to my meaning,” pursued Rob, feverishly. “If we\r\nonly get back in time to make use of the stuff, we could shut off\r\nthe fire from the other section of the town, where all the mills and\r\nworkshops are.”\r\n\r\nRalph gave a whoop. Evidently something like the truth must have\r\nflashed athwart his active mind.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Rob, you’ve got that old abandoned building in mind, haven’t\r\nyou?” he demanded in turn, with a note of exultation in his voice.\r\n\r\n“Nothing else,” came the incisive reply, as all of them continued to\r\nrun on.\r\n\r\n“To blow it up would leave a gap, wouldn’t it?” continued Ralph.\r\n\r\n“Just what I’d expect to make by destroying that long rambling\r\nbuilding,” Rob explained. “If any fire jumped across after that, we\r\ncould take care of it; but the main lot would be held in check at\r\nthe gap. That’s what they sometimes do when a great fire is raging\r\nin a big city. It is the last resort of desperation.”\r\n\r\n“I like the scheme!” declared Sim, instantly.\r\n\r\n“It sounds good to me!” added Andy.\r\n\r\nTubby, too, may have had an opinion, but he was not given a chance\r\nto express it, for just then they arrived at the garage where the\r\nbig car had been left.\r\n\r\n“Don’t lose a second if you can help it, Ralph!” called out Rob.\r\n\r\n“You bet I won’t, Rob!” snapped the other, as he made a rush in the\r\nquarter where he could see the car standing waiting for them.\r\n\r\n“Have the headlights on, too, because we want to make fast time, and\r\ncan’t take chances of an accident!” called out the scout leader.\r\n\r\n“How about us, Rob?” asked Sim.\r\n\r\n“You three fellows will have to stay here and wait for us,” came the\r\norder, and Sim, knowing that Rob always meant what he said, and was\r\nmoreover the head of the Eagle Patrol, did not attempt to dispute\r\nhis word.\r\n\r\nThey were keenly disappointed, for nothing would have pleased Sim\r\nand Andy more than to accompany the others in their mad flight out\r\nto the distant farmhouse, some ten miles away, to fetch back the\r\nexplosives that might yet save the better part of the apparently\r\ndoomed town.\r\n\r\nAgain Tubby said nothing. He would have gone had it appeared to be a\r\npart of his duty. Tubby was not “hankering” after such a furious\r\nrace against time. Besides, what would be the need of five trying to\r\ndo what two could just as well accomplish? Tubby could show a streak\r\nof discretion occasionally, it seemed. Then, again, it would be hard\r\nto tear away from that scene of tremendous excitement, the like of\r\nwhich none of them had ever seen before.\r\n\r\nRalph was very much excited, and this may have interfered a little\r\nwith his efforts to get the car out of the garage in the least\r\npossible time. Still, he managed fairly well, though Rob was\r\ncounting the seconds as never before, with all that riotous noise\r\nringing in his ears, and calling for speedy action.\r\n\r\nPresently the car came swinging into sight, with Ralph at the wheel.\r\nRob made a flying leap and was quickly alongside the driver.\r\n\r\n“Now hit it up for home, licketty-split, Ralph!” he called out as he\r\nfell back upon his seat in front.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, and good luck, fellows!” cried Tubby, warmly.\r\n\r\n“Don’t meet with any accident, whatever you do!” added Sim, for the\r\nloss of the whole town did not count one-quarter so much in his\r\nestimation as would an injury to his beloved chum, Rob.\r\n\r\nThen, with a series of loud snorts, very much after the style of a\r\nhorse under whip and spurs, the big car darted away.\r\n\r\nAt first Ralph had to go comparatively slow, because of the fact\r\nthat there were many people on the roads, scurrying this way and\r\nthat, some of them bearing treasures in their arms snatched from\r\nhousehold effects, under the impetus of their lively fears. Wagons\r\nand other vehicles too were encountered, but Ralph, being a clever\r\ndriver, managed to swing around these.\r\n\r\nHe also kept punching the siren and making a series of staccato\r\nsounds such as you can hear whenever an ambulance, or the vehicle of\r\na fire-chief dashes through the streets of your city or town in a\r\nsudden emergency.\r\n\r\nSo as a rule they were given a pretty decent right of way. People\r\nbrushed aside even while not able to understand what right this car\r\nhad to the road. Possibly it was accepted as an explanation that\r\nperhaps they were speeding for the next town to engage the fire\r\ndepartment in the effort to save poor Wyoming.\r\n\r\nBehind them lay the burning town. Rob looked back once and shuddered\r\nat what he saw, nor could he ever dismiss it wholly from his mind.\r\nOften in future nights, as he sat looking into a sparkling campfire,\r\nhe would again see in imagination Wyoming burning, with the flames\r\nshooting high in the air, and myriads of flying sparks making it\r\nseem like a grand Fourth of July fireworks.\r\n\r\nHe bent all his energies to the task of peering ahead, and assisting\r\nthe chauffeur keep track of the road, in which they were likely to\r\nmeet some sort of obstacle at almost any moment.\r\n\r\n“Seems pretty clear just now!” Rob ventured to say as they fairly\r\nflew along at the rate of almost a mile a minute, the old car doing\r\nnobly when Ralph turned on every particle of power.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is, but we’re apt to meet a wagon coming to market any old\r\ntime!” the other shot back at him, never taking his eyes from the\r\nroad ahead even for a second.\r\n\r\nRob understood. He knew that farmers coming to sell their produce or\r\nhay in the local markets were likely to start away from home during\r\nthe night so as to be in the square before peep of dawn. Yes, there\r\nwas always a chance that they would meet one or more of these\r\n“hayseeds,” as Sim always called the honest tillers of the soil,\r\nperhaps asleep on his load; though such a thing was hardly possible\r\nwith all that brilliant illumination in the sky, as though the world\r\nwere coming to an end; and, besides, the muttering roar that sounded\r\nlike a battle, Rob thought.\r\n\r\nThe headlights were none too brilliant, though answering ordinary\r\npurposes. Rob could have wished they were twice as strong, since\r\nthat would have given a longer range, and they could distinguish any\r\nvehicle on the road much further away.\r\n\r\nAround certain bends in the road they swung with a vehemence that\r\nalmost took Rob’s breath away. He had told Ralph to make the utmost\r\nspeed, and the other was taking his words literally. Several times\r\nRob almost thought they would skid, and bring up in a heap; but\r\nowing partly to good luck as well as Ralph’s superior knowledge of\r\nthe pilot’s duties, they always managed to avoid this particular\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nIt was utterly impossible for Rob to count the passage of time. He\r\nwas aware of the fact that it would take them at least twelve\r\nminutes, perhaps more, to make the trip, even when going at this mad\r\npace. Counting the same back, and a short delay while securing the\r\ndynamite and the battery, it must be something like half an hour\r\nthat they would be away from town.\r\n\r\nHe wondered whether that would seal the doom of Wyoming. The fire\r\nwas being urged on with feverish haste by that compelling wind, and\r\nit was only a question of so much time before it reached the\r\nconnecting link between the mill part of the town and that section\r\nwhere the conflagration already raged.\r\n\r\nWell, they would do all in their power to carry out their plan; if\r\nthey failed, in spite of everything, no blame could be attached to\r\nthem. A scout need not reproach himself if he has conscientiously\r\ndone his duty; the rest has to be left to a higher power than his\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n“Look out! I see something ahead!” suddenly snapped Rob, as they\r\nturned a bend, mostly on two wheels.\r\n\r\nRalph slowed down instantly. At the same time he sounded the Klaxon,\r\nand veered more or less to one side of the road.\r\n\r\nIt turned out to be a market wagon belonging to some “trucker” who\r\nwas making for town in order to dispose of his vegetables, fresh\r\neggs, and fowls. He gave them at least half of the road, and they\r\nwhirled past. Before they reached him they heard his voice raised to\r\na bellow in which wonder and alarm predominated.\r\n\r\n“Hey! what’s that red light in the sky mean, Mister?”\r\n\r\n“Wyoming is all afire!” Rob shouted back; and no doubt his words\r\ncaused the man to experience a sensation akin to fright.\r\n\r\nSo they kept flying along. It was a weird ride, as remarkable as any\r\none could possibly experience, and the attending conditions added to\r\nits strangeness.\r\n\r\nThe next obstacle happened to be a load of hay. Here they were\r\ndelayed for as much as half a precious minute of time in getting\r\nsafely by, since the wagon took up so much of the road. Ralph again\r\nproved himself to be the right party at the wheel, for he finally\r\nmanaged to negotiate the passage without an upset.\r\n\r\nWhere there were straight stretches Ralph made fearful time. No\r\ncontestant in the Vanderbilt Cup Race could have done much better,\r\nRob thought, as he held his hat with one hand, and strove to see\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nAll the while he knew what desperate chances they were taking, since\r\nthis old car was not built for a racing machine. At any moment some\r\nweak part might give way, and--well, Rob did not like to even think\r\nwhat the result was bound to be if such a thing came to pass. At\r\nleast, they would never know what hit them, and there was a little\r\ngrim consolation about that.\r\n\r\nThe road was unfamiliar to the visitor, but Ralph knew it like a\r\nbook; and while he had to keep his eyes fixed ahead, at the same\r\ntime familiar turns continually told him just what section they had\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n“Halfway there!” he called out at one time, and Rob drew a long\r\nbreath of satisfaction, for it meant that they had done a fair\r\nportion of the course without meeting with any accident.\r\n\r\n“Three-quarters there!” Ralph again told him shortly afterwards;\r\nindeed, to Rob, it seemed as though two minutes had hardly elapsed,\r\nand yet more than a brace of miles must have been covered during the\r\ninterval.\r\n\r\n“I can see lights ahead that look as if they came from a house,\r\nRalph!” he suddenly burst out with.\r\n\r\n“Sure thing! That’s our place!” the other announced.\r\n\r\nStill, on they rushed, and presently Ralph cut down the speed.\r\n\r\n“Here we are, safe and sound, Rob!” he exclaimed, as he turned in at\r\nthe lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Chapter XVIII\r\n\r\n                      Back to the Burning Town\r\n\r\n\r\nRalph was now on very familiar ground. Every foot of territory was\r\nso well known to him that he could perhaps have gone over it with\r\nhis eyes blindfolded.\r\n\r\nSome one came out with a lantern. It was Mr. Jeffords, who must have\r\nbeen considerably exercised after discovering that amazing glow in\r\nthe heavens above Wyoming.\r\n\r\n“What’s happened?” he called out, as he ran toward the spot where\r\nthe two boys were springing from the car, “and where is the rest of\r\nyour crowd?”\r\n\r\n“You tell him, Rob, while I run off to get some of that dynamite.\r\nFortunately, I have a key to the little house where we keep it in\r\nstock. Give me my electric light from under the front seat, where I\r\nalways carry it. All right, Rob, I’ll be back in a rush!”\r\n\r\nWith that Ralph dashed madly away. Judge of the amazement of his\r\nfather, who must by this time have begun to fear the world was awry,\r\nand that even his own boy had lost his mind in the mad turmoil.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, what does it all mean, Rob?” he demanded, with quivering\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n“The town’s all afire, sir, and this wind is whipping the flames so\r\nthat it begins to look as if everything would go,” the boy told him,\r\nas he proceeded to get in the car. “I’m only going to turn around so\r\nas to save a minute of time. We must speed back there again as fast\r\nas we can make it.”\r\n\r\n“But why did you come out here?” questioned the puzzled farmer.\r\n\r\n“To get some of your dynamite,” Rob explained. “Don’t you see, sir,\r\nthere is a chance, by blowing up that old building standing between\r\nthe mill section of Wyoming and the rest of the place, we can make a\r\nbreach, and keep the fire from getting across to the factories and\r\nmills.”\r\n\r\n“A clever scheme, and I warrant that it came out of your head, Rob\r\nBlake!” exclaimed the other, in admiration.\r\n\r\n“Never mind about that, sir. It is the last desperate resort in a\r\ncity fire that is being spread by a high wind. If only we can get\r\nback in time, I believe it may work.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go with you, Rob!” said the farmer, seized with the\r\nfascination of the thing. He immediately rushed toward the house to\r\nget a hat and coat.\r\n\r\nRob was sorry he had taken this stand. He hoped the old gentleman\r\nwould not delay them in any way. Then, again, if an accident\r\nhappened, it would be too bad to have him in the car.\r\n\r\nRob had taken the time before they left town, and he again consulted\r\nhis little nickel watch. He could hardly believe his eyes when he\r\nfound that twelve minutes only had elapsed since they said good-bye\r\nto Tubby and the other fellows. This meant that Ralph must have made\r\ntremendous time of it while racing madly along that country road. No\r\nwonder they had been jumped up and down continually, as they struck\r\nuneven places in the turnpike.\r\n\r\nHe kept looking off toward the spot where Ralph would be likely to\r\ncome from. Could the other carry both the sticks of dynamite and the\r\nbattery as well? Rob almost wished he had gone with him, and was\r\nthinking whether it was yet too late, when he heard a hail. Then\r\ncame a flash of light, which he knew must be from that little hand\r\nelectric torch they had found so useful when hunting the woods for\r\nthe lost child, Caleb.\r\n\r\nJust then Mr. Jeffords came along, much to Rob’s relief. At least he\r\nwould not delay them, which was one comfort.\r\n\r\n“Please get in, sir, so we can be off in a hurry!” the scout leader\r\nremarked. As Mr. Jeffords realized the necessity for conserving\r\nevery second of time in a great emergency such as now confronted\r\nthem, he showed no evidence of being offended by this urging, but\r\nhastened to take his seat in the rear.\r\n\r\nRob was already in place, and Ralph came hurrying up. In his arms he\r\ncarried quite a staggering amount of stuff, and was breathing hard\r\nfrom his exertions.\r\n\r\nThe battery and other things he stowed hastily in the back of the\r\ncar, where there was plenty of room. Then, getting aboard himself,\r\nfor the engine was throbbing as though impatient to be given its\r\nhead, Ralph made a quick start.\r\n\r\nPresently they were again on the road, and heading toward town. The\r\nfiery heavens, now spread before them, added to the dreadful\r\npicture. It surely looked as though the last day had indeed arrived,\r\nwhen the world was about to go up in flames and smoke.\r\n\r\nMr. Jeffords would have liked to ask further questions, for his\r\ncuriosity had been raised to the last notch; but the conditions\r\nhardly favored such a thing. They were speeding faster than he had\r\never gone in all his life. He had some difficulty in keeping his hat\r\non. Moreover, every time he started to open his mouth the wind\r\nrushed down his throat and nearly choked him; so on the whole he\r\nwisely concluded to repress his desire to know more about the\r\ncatastrophe that had befallen Wyoming.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer the town the wind brought to their ears some of\r\nthe clamorous noises that were arising; and this in spite of the\r\nracket their own fast speed created. With each wild swing around a\r\nbend the old gentleman doubtless imagined the end had come; but he\r\nwas certainly game, and gave no evidence of any craven fear.\r\n\r\nRob was keeping a bright lookout for that hay-wagon again. He hoped\r\nthe man upon learning that the town was afire would have switched\r\noff the main road, and started back home by another roundabout\r\ncourse. As they continued to fail to overtake the cumbersome object\r\nthat almost filled the road, Rob’s hope kept rising, and he finally\r\ndecided that this was just what had happened.\r\n\r\nLuck was with them in other ways. They not only negotiated the turns\r\nsuccessfully, but, meeting several wagons coming out of Wyoming,\r\nthey found that they were given the right of way, and more than half\r\nthe road, thanks, no doubt, to the vigorous fashion in which Ralph\r\ntooted his shrill Klaxon almost constantly.\r\n\r\nDrawing nearer town and the sounds began to be appalling. Mr.\r\nJeffords must have been thrilled through and through by what he saw\r\nand heard. The flames could now be seen leaping up as though\r\nexulting over their complete mastery of the works of man’s hands.\r\nRob was wondering and hoping and even praying in connection with\r\ntheir having drawn perilously close to that connecting link. Would\r\nthey arrive in time, or had the fatal leap across already taken\r\nplace?\r\n\r\nWith other sounds they could hear the roar of many voices.\r\nDoubtless, citizens had joined with the firemen in order to fight\r\nthe flames, knowing that their fair town would be in complete ruins\r\nbefore morning if they did not manage in some fashion to get the\r\nmastery over the raging fire. Then, again, women and children must\r\nbe shrieking, dogs barking, horses neighing, and every imaginable\r\nsound mingling to make that furious chorus.\r\n\r\nIt was hard now for Ralph to get along, because of the congestion.\r\nThus, in spite of the warning Klaxon, they were detained several\r\nprecious seconds while waiting for some wretched vehicle to get out\r\nof the way. Besides this there were children to be avoided, and all\r\nsorts of vexatious delays.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all, however, Rob felt sure they had come back in record\r\ntime. Unless his calculations were all awry, he believed they would\r\nnot be too late to try out his suddenly conceived scheme to save\r\nWyoming.\r\n\r\nAt one spot, as they were held up for a brief space of time, judge\r\nof Rob’s surprise when Sim clambered into the car.\r\n\r\n“Careful how you step on that dynamite!” warned Rob, at the same\r\ntime hoping that Tubby and Andy might not also show up, and cause a\r\nthreat of trouble.\r\n\r\nIt seemed, however, that Sim had been the only one able to break\r\naway from the entrancing scene of destruction and excitement. He had\r\nsuddenly realized that the car would of necessity be compelled to\r\ncome back the same way it went, and accordingly Sim had waylaid it\r\non the border of the town.\r\n\r\nWhen it was really unsafe to go any further, Ralph brought the car\r\nto a stop.\r\n\r\n“We’d better get out here,” he said, huskily, for somehow he seemed\r\nto still be out of breath from his exertions out at the farm.\r\n\r\n“First thing,” said Ralph, “I must find Mr. Megrue, the Fire Chief.\r\nHe’d be the only one to authorize the use of this stuff. Rob, you\r\nand Sim carry it with you over near the old factory building. I’ll\r\nlook for you there.”\r\n\r\nThey had already discovered one thing that pleased them, which was\r\nthat the fire had not as yet reached that connecting link. It was\r\nfearfully close, though, and if they hoped to try out Rob’s\r\nbrilliant scheme there must evidently be no time wasted.\r\n\r\nMr. Jeffords stuck by the pair. Apparently, he meant to see the\r\nthing through, and also that the boys got a square deal.\r\n\r\n“Let me help carry something.”\r\n\r\nRalph had had little time to gather a bunch of the terrible dynamite\r\ncartridges used for tearing stumps from the soil, and racking the\r\nearth ten feet deep in the new method of farming. They were in a\r\nlittle canvas bag just as he had apparently snatched them up in his\r\nhaste.\r\n\r\n“You can carry these, sir, if you will,” said Rob, thrusting the\r\nsmall sack of explosives into the farmer’s hands; “it’s the\r\ndynamite, sir, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll make sure not to stumble, Rob, if that’s what you’re hinting\r\nat,” replied the old gentleman farmer, as he carefully gathered his\r\nload in his arms, shielding it against all possible knocks and\r\ncollisions.\r\n\r\nThey left the old car where it stood, though Rob had taken the\r\ntrouble to shut off the engine before deserting it. For the present\r\ntheir whole attention must be concentrated upon something else. If\r\ntheir plans were successful, no doubt they would find the car again\r\nwhere they had abandoned it; and if the fire jumped the gap, in\r\nspite of all their efforts, why, then, it would be time enough to\r\nget the car out of danger.\r\n\r\nSuch sights as surrounded them they had never looked on before.\r\nPeople by this time had reached the border of a panic. Many were mad\r\nwith fright, and their cries added to the confusion. Women and men\r\nwere dragging children after them, sometimes also loaded down with\r\nstuff they wished to save, though often it seemed to be mere trash,\r\nsuch as a metal washtub filled with cheap kitchen utensils.\r\n\r\nRob was reminded of a comical description he had once read of a\r\nfire, and what absurd things some people do under the stress of\r\nexcitement, throwing glass and delicate things out of the window,\r\nand trotting down the stairs with a mattress. Still, none of them\r\n“cracked a smile” at the queer sights. Tragedy surrounded them,\r\nwhich would not allow of an expression of humor. There was nothing\r\nfunny about a town burning down.\r\n\r\nJust as Rob had anticipated, they found the other fellows in the\r\nvicinity of the deserted building that they meant to destroy, in\r\nhopes of staying the onward sweep of the flames. Andy and Tubby,\r\nremembering what their chums meant to do, had taken up their post\r\nclose by, and anxiously counted the passing minutes, even while also\r\nobserving the many strange sights that continually cropped up around\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTubby had read about Bedlam, and he wondered if it could “hold a\r\ncandle” to the mingled noises surrounding them. He had listened to\r\nthe crackling of flames before now, for Tubby had seen some pretty\r\nbig fires both in the city and in the woods; but those in the past\r\nwere not to be compared with what he now experienced. While Tubby\r\nwas standing there, now resting on one foot, and again on the other,\r\nhe heard Andy give a whoop of delight, and, on turning, beheld the\r\nwelcome face of Rob Blake, as well as that of Sim, and back of them\r\nthe tall figure of Mr. Jeffords, all of them carrying something in\r\ntheir arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Chapter XIX\r\n\r\n                       Behind the Broken Door\r\n\r\n\r\n“You got what you went after, then, didn’t you, Rob?” asked Tubby,\r\ndelighted to see the scout leader again.\r\n\r\nThey had gone off at such a furious pace that ever since Tubby had\r\nbeen anxious concerning their safety. While watching the advance of\r\nthe devouring element, and the desperate efforts of the gallant\r\nfiremen to try and throw some obstacles in the path of the flames,\r\nTubby’s thoughts would constantly go out toward the absent chums,\r\nwith whose well being he was so greatly concerned.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it’s here along with us,” Rob told him.\r\n\r\n“But, say, what about Ralph?” demanded Andy, suddenly noticing that\r\nthe party he mentioned was absent.\r\n\r\n“He came back with us, all right,” the scout leader replied. “Just\r\nnow he’s trying to find the Chief of the Fire Department. You see,\r\nwe couldn’t start trying to blow up this building here without his\r\nconsent.”\r\n\r\n“Land’s sake alive! I hope they get here pretty quick, then!”\r\nejaculated Tubby. “It’s coming closer and closer right along. Andy\r\nand myself were getting ready to clear out of here when you showed\r\nup.”\r\n\r\nRob had already noticed this for himself. His nervousness came back,\r\nonly instead of a fear lest some accident happen to the speeding\r\ncar, he now had something else to bother him.\r\n\r\nThey could feel the intense heat where they stood. Sparks fell all\r\naround them, endangering their eyes if they ventured to look upward.\r\n\r\n“Better turn your coat collars up, fellows,” advised Rob. “If you\r\ngot one of these flying sparks down your back you wouldn’t like it\r\nmuch.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” commented Andy, “an ounce of prevention is better\r\nthan a pound of cure. Whew! just look at that cloud of sparks rise\r\nup! Must have been a building collapsed then to make the shower.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t see Ralph coming along yet,” complained Tubby, as he\r\nstrained his eyes to stare down the street where the other must\r\nappear if he came at all.\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of people in sight, most of them onlookers who\r\nwere fascinated by the dreadful picture presented by the roaring\r\nabyss of flames, though others were hard pressed firemen dragging\r\ntheir hose about in the endeavor to find some place where they might\r\nthrow a stream into that old building just in the path of the\r\noncoming flames.\r\n\r\nPrecious seconds were passing, Rob knew. He wondered whether he\r\ndared attempt to carry out his bold plan even without the consent of\r\nthe Fire Chief. One thing certain, unless Mr. Megrue came along\r\nshortly, the last chance to attempt saving the mills would be lost.\r\nThe fire was already close to the ruined building, and at any moment\r\nthey might expect to see it burst into flames, for it must by now be\r\ngetting frightfully hot.\r\n\r\nTubby gave a sudden cry, and was seen hurrying toward a wagon that,\r\nloaded with household goods, and drawn by a man and woman, both\r\nforeigners, in place of a horse, had just passed them by. Something\r\nhad fallen off the load; it sprawled there in the street, and lusty\r\nyells announced that it must be a fat baby.\r\n\r\nTubby picked it up and hastened to overtake the man and woman who\r\nwere tugging so lustily between the shafts. Then, having given over\r\nthe child into the charge of its mother, Tubby gallantly took hold\r\nhimself, and started to assist the man to draw his possessions\r\nfurther away from the grip of the fire demon.\r\n\r\nThat was just like Tubby, whose heart always beat in sympathy with\r\nany one in trouble. He would do without a meal in order to enjoy\r\nseeing a hungry dog devour what had been intended for his own\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nHe did not intend going any great distance. After tugging for half a\r\nblock at the load, he felt that he had done his duty. Besides, if\r\nRob’s plan worked as they hoped, this section of the town would be\r\nspared, and there was no absolute necessity for any one fleeing to a\r\ngreat distance.\r\n\r\nSo Tubby came back again, blowing like a porpoise from his\r\nexertions. Ralph had not shown up yet, but Rob placed a hand\r\naffectionately on his shoulder and it needed nothing more to tell\r\nTubby that his act had both been seen and appreciated at its true\r\nworth by the one whose good opinion he chiefly cared for.\r\n\r\n“I believe they’re coming, Rob!” Andy announced, greatly to the\r\nsatisfaction of everybody.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that way, and almost immediately the others also\r\ndiscovered the figure of their companion hurrying towards them. At\r\nRalph’s side strode the tall form of a man wearing a glazed fire\r\nhat, and a coat that was supposed to be immune to sparks and flames.\r\n\r\n“I guess that’s Chief Megrue,” remarked Mr. Jeffords, eagerly,\r\n“though his face is so black with the smoke and dirt his own wife\r\nwouldn’t recognize him. Yes, I know his walk. Now we may see\r\nsomething done that will bring results. I was just about to suggest\r\nthat you go ahead on your own hook, Rob, and I would stand for the\r\nconsequences. Desperate cases require desperate remedies, you know.\r\nBut there’s no need of our doing that now, fortunately.”\r\n\r\nRalph piloted his companion to the spot where the others awaited\r\nthem. Undoubtedly he must have already found occasion to explain\r\nRob’s scheme to the head man of the local fire department. Mr.\r\nMegrue had been instantly seized with a conviction that it was\r\nindeed the only thing left to them, since all the puny efforts they\r\nhad made to try and drown the fire out had been without avail.\r\n\r\nEvery fireman must know that such things are resorted to in all big\r\ncity fires when the violence of the wind makes it impossible to head\r\nthe flames off in any other way. Sometimes it turns out\r\nsuccessfully; and then, again, there may be no tangible result,\r\nowing to circumstances over which even the use of explosives will\r\nhave no control.\r\n\r\nRob saw with more or less pleasure that the Chief was a man of\r\naction, and not one of those old fogies sometimes connected with\r\nlocal companies, all “fuss and feathers,” but lacking in the dash\r\nand valor that should distinguish every firefighter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps had he known where he could put his hand on a store of\r\nexplosives, the Chief might before this have considered the\r\npossibility of blocking the flames by destroying that old connecting\r\nlink of a building.\r\n\r\n“He says it’s the finest thing going!” called out Ralph, as he drew\r\nnear where his father and the boys were waiting for him. “As I know\r\nhow to handle the stuff, as well as the battery, he asks us to do\r\nthe job. Rob, I want your help only. Come with me. The Chief will\r\nsmash in the door for us, and we can plant the charge in a hurry.\r\nThen it only means running the wires out to some place here, and\r\nafterwards you can touch her off. That ought to be your privilege,\r\nRob, because you thought up the scheme. Right along this way, Rob,\r\nplease!”\r\n\r\nPerhaps Sim and Andy, not to mention Tubby, might have liked very\r\nmuch to be given a part to play in the game; but their common sense\r\ntold them there was no necessity for more entering the building than\r\njust those two, unless Chief Megrue chose to accompany the boys. At\r\nleast, they could have the satisfaction of being present when the\r\nbig affair came off, and watching that ramshackle building collapse\r\ninto kindling wood after the charge was fired.\r\n\r\nThe Chief fortunately had a fire ax with him. It may have been used\r\nto batter in the doors of many a building that had commenced to\r\nsmoke, and give other positive signs of being about to burst into\r\nflames. Besides, it is always a useful tool in the hands of your\r\ncountry-town fireman, with which he loves to smash windows, and to\r\nmake a grand show of accomplishing things.\r\n\r\nStraight up to the door of the unused building the three of them\r\nhurried, the boys bearing the battery, the little cask containing\r\nthe dynamite cartridges, and the coil of wire necessary to complete\r\nthe outfit.\r\n\r\n“The door is locked or barred!” shouted Sim, which remark told that\r\nhe had, during the absence of Ralph and Rob, made a little private\r\ninvestigation on his own account, for it happened that Sim Jeffords\r\nwas of a very inquiring nature.\r\n\r\nThis information saved the others from wasting any time trying to\r\nopen the barrier. It also gave Mr. Megrue his clue, for, rushing\r\ndirectly up, he commenced to wield that ax of his in a way that\r\nproved him to be a born fire-fighter.\r\n\r\nWith every blow Tubby and Andy and Sim gave vent to a whoop; which\r\nhelped get rid of their extra enthusiasm, and also showed how they\r\nappreciated the work of the axman.\r\n\r\n“Go to it, Chief!” shrilled Sim, excitedly. “That time the chips\r\nflew, I’m telling you! Give it another smash like that, and you’ll\r\nsee it go down. Wow! look at that crackerjack hit, will you,\r\nfellows? It’s an extra stout door, all right, but just the same it’s\r\ngot to go! Once more to the breach everybody. So, there!”\r\n\r\nThe ax sank into the door, and ripped the panels up. Again did Mr.\r\nMegrue swing it back of him, and once more was that smashing sound\r\nheard, so pleasing to the ear of the listening and watching boys,\r\nwho kept one eye on the little drama being played before them, and\r\nat the same time managed to observe the close approach of the sea of\r\nfire menacing the deserted factory.\r\n\r\nFinally a shout from Sim announced that the door had been beaten\r\nopen, and that the way into the building no longer held any obstacle\r\nto the advance of the trio.\r\n\r\nThey vanished from view, Fire Chief, Rob and Ralph. The three boys,\r\ntogether with Ralph’s father, had to possess their souls in patience\r\nwhile waiting for the reappearance of the bold invaders. At any\r\nmoment now they fully expected the building to burst into flames, so\r\noverheated must the dry woodwork have become. It was an anxious time\r\nfor Mr. Jeffords, who had seen his son disappear beyond that broken\r\ndoor. At the same time he knew that Ralph was capable of thinking\r\nfor himself, and also that he and Rob would not attempt any\r\nfoolhardy feat just for the sake of “showing off.”\r\n\r\nThere was a method in their madness in the present case. The welfare\r\nof the whole community hung in the balance, for if the fire could\r\nnot be stayed by this master stroke of genius, then was Wyoming\r\ndoomed; and the morrow’s sun would rise upon the smoking ruins of\r\nthe entire town.\r\n\r\nSeconds passed, and changed into minutes. When it seemed as though\r\nsomething like two of these had drifted along, every one was growing\r\nweak with apprehension. They had terrible visions of some evil\r\nhaving overtaken those who had gone into the building. It was old,\r\nand the floors almost in ruins, so that there was even a possibility\r\nthat the venturesome ones had fallen through some unnoticed gap.\r\nThen, again, how were they to tell if some sort of insidious gas had\r\ngripped their chums, and rendered them helpless?\r\n\r\nThese were the kind of strange fancies that took possession of Sim\r\nJeffords, always gifted with a lively imagination. He pictured Rob\r\nand his cousin lying there inside the old wreck of a factory,\r\nvictims of a treacherous gas, and soon to be devoured by the\r\noncoming flames.\r\n\r\nSim could stand it no longer. He must ascertain the truth, for it\r\nwas always better to know the worst, according to his policy. He\r\nwould rush forward and cautiously enter the building, groping his\r\nway through the smoke-filled interior, and calling out the names of\r\nhis cousin and Rob.\r\n\r\nFilled with this resolution, Sim had even commenced to approach the\r\nopen door, paying no attention to the calls of his uncle from the\r\nrear, when, to his great relief, he saw figures bursting out of the\r\nstructure. They were Chief Megrue, Rob, the scout leader, and Ralph\r\nJeffords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Chapter XX\r\n\r\n                   The Struggle to Save the Town\r\n\r\n\r\nSim counted the figures that came trooping out through the opening\r\nwhere the smashed door lay a wreck. When he found that none were\r\nmissing, a great load seemed lifted from his heart.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! it’s all working out as it should, and now we’ll see what\r\nRob Blake’s plan is going to do for Wyoming!” he found himself\r\nshouting; although Sim was so greatly excited, he hardly knew\r\nhimself what he said.\r\n\r\nRalph could be seen with the reel of wire in his possession. He was\r\nplainly unwinding it as he went, while Rob undertook to see that\r\nthere were no kinks in the strands as they came off the barrel of\r\nthe reel. Soon they were alongside Sim, who fell in step with the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe Fire Chief looked additionally anxious. He undoubtedly knew what\r\ntremendous issues were involved in this last effort to save the\r\ntown. Gallantly had he and his followers battled with the destroying\r\nfoe, but so long as that furious breeze held out, all their efforts\r\nwould have been in vain. He knew that unless some such desperate\r\nremedy as this explosion came to the relief of the outclassed fire\r\ndepartment, the fate of Wyoming was sealed.\r\n\r\nHe devoted himself just now to seeing that there were no stragglers\r\nclose enough to the doomed building to be injured when the dynamite\r\nwas exploded. Several men belonging to one of the fire companies\r\ncould be seen nearby, trying to turn the nozzle of the hose they\r\nwielded so that a stream of water would fall upon the old building;\r\nfor it was recognized that unless the conflagration could be halted\r\nat this particular spot all work was useless.\r\n\r\nChief Megrue shouted to them, and when he had by this means caught\r\ntheir attention, he beckoned wildly. Although they might not quite\r\nunderstand what his motions meant, at least they were accustomed to\r\nobeying orders without questioning.\r\n\r\nDragging their hose after them with an effort, they commenced to\r\nhead toward the spot where the Chief stood. This promised to take\r\ntime, for their load was heavy; and seconds just then counted\r\nconsiderably more than a new supply of hose meant to the imperiled\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n“Drop it, and come here as fast as you can run!” bellowed Chief\r\nMegrue, using his hands in lieu of a megaphone; for it seemed that\r\nhe had lost his trumpet while hard pushed to escape from a fiery\r\ntrap when caught in a building that suddenly burst into flames,\r\ngiving him scant time to dash out again to safety.\r\n\r\nThe men looked as though they could not understand what he meant.\r\nThey evidently disliked abandoning a length of perfectly sound hose\r\nwhen there seemed no absolute necessity for it. Again did the Chief\r\nshout at them, continuing his wild beckoning at the same time.\r\n\r\n“Hurry this way! Drop that hose, and come as fast as you can! We are\r\ngoing to dynamite that building, don’t you understand, you fools?”\r\n\r\nPerhaps that one word “dynamite” gave them their cue, for without\r\nany further hesitation the three men dropped the hose, which\r\ncommenced to writhe like a snake as the force of the water passing\r\nthrough the brass nozzle turned it this way and that. So they\r\nstarted to run toward the Chief.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Ralph, assisted by Rob, had continued to move steadily\r\naway. The wire would allow of their proceeding to a safe distance,\r\nwhen the battery could be quickly attached, and a connection made.\r\n\r\nSim had now been joined by both Tubby and Andy. All of them felt\r\ntheir hearts beating tumultuously, for no one could do more than\r\nguess at the result of the bold plan.\r\n\r\nOne thing sure, they had not left the old building a minute too\r\nsoon. Why, it was on fire even then, for Sim could see flames\r\ncreeping along the roof. He wondered whether there would be any\r\nbreak in the wire sufficient to prevent the full current of\r\nelectricity from passing along it when Ralph came to making the\r\ncontact. If such a thing did happen, it would be much too late to\r\ntry and remedy the defect, because after that time it must be sheer\r\nmadness for any one to dream of entering the deserted factory again.\r\n\r\nSurely Ralph and Rob must by now have gained a sufficient distance\r\nto be safe from any debris that might be thrown up into the air when\r\nthe explosion came. Still, Ralph was the doctor in this instance,\r\nfor he had had the experience in blasting out stumps and dislodging\r\ngreat rocks by the use of the dynamite.\r\n\r\nMr. Jeffords was there, too, watching his boy with eagerness. Then,\r\nbesides, there were the trio of bedraggled firemen who had joined\r\ntheir chief at his command, all of them deeply interested in the\r\nsuccess or failure of the scheme that meant so much for Wyoming.\r\n\r\nThe clamor all around them was just as boisterous as ever, for\r\ncertainly nothing had occurred to tone it down. The citizens, facing\r\ncomplete destruction for their town, were hoarse with shouting; but\r\ntheir main thought now was to make sure of the safety of the women\r\nand children, who could be seen fleeing through most of the streets,\r\nawed by the terrible nature of the calamity.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, none of those who watched Ralph and Rob paid the least\r\nattention to these outside occurrences. The fire might roar, and the\r\npopulace shriek in terror, but just then their undivided attention\r\nwas given to the little drama being unfolded before their eyes.\r\n\r\nAh! Ralph no longer pushed on. Whether he had reached the end of his\r\nwire coil, or believed that it was useless to cover more ground did\r\nnot matter. What did count was the fact that he and Rob were\r\nfeverishly attaching the battery and switch to the wires, showing\r\nthat they intended to test their hastily arranged programme without\r\nfurther delay.\r\n\r\n“Oh! hurry, hurry, please!” groaned Tubby, speaking to himself, of\r\ncourse, but in so doing voicing the feeling that held sway in every\r\nheart; for the building was rapidly being clutched in the ever\r\nextending fingers of the fire, and would soon be such a mass of\r\nflames that to wreck it might do more harm than good.\r\n\r\n“It’s all ready!” whooped Sim, as he saw by the actions of the two\r\nboys that they had succeeded in making the attachments.\r\n\r\nThen Ralph pushed Rob forward. It could be seen that he meant to\r\nforce the scout leader to press the button that would complete the\r\nwork. Even in that dreadful moment Ralph did not forget that it had\r\nbeen Rob’s brilliant idea, after all, and to his chivalrous mind it\r\nseemed only right and proper that Rob’s hand should be the one by\r\nmeans of which Wyoming might be saved.\r\n\r\nRob did not hesitate. This was no time for expostulation. He\r\nproceeded to do as the other urged him. Those who stood by held\r\ntheir breath with awe, watching the old deserted factory the while,\r\nas though everything depended on the result of Ralph’s efforts.\r\n\r\nThey saw the building give a distinct shiver. Then the very earth\r\nunder them actually rocked as if an earthquake had taken place.\r\nTubby was thrown down, and the rest had more or less difficulty in\r\nkeeping on their feet, such was the concussion of air as the\r\ndynamite went off.\r\n\r\nThey also heard a heavy roar, and then, wonder of wonders, the old\r\nbuilding seemed to collapse, to fall down like a house made of\r\ncards. There was a horrible series of crashing sounds; some remnants\r\neven fell close by the boys, though luckily none of them received\r\nthe slightest injury. Then, as the smoke shifted and the dust clouds\r\nsettled, they saw a great gap where the deserted factory had stood.\r\n\r\nThe Fire Chief was awake to the possibility of the debris presenting\r\na new peril. He immediately gave orders to the three men to make\r\ntheir way forward, and if the hose were still in condition for use\r\nto turn the nozzle toward the wreck.\r\n\r\nThen he hastened away to fetch up others, so that all efforts might\r\nbe concentrated on that one section. The fight for the rest of the\r\ntown must be made then and there. Already a heavy blow had been\r\nstruck to beat back the fire; and if only it could be held to the\r\nother side, the valuable plants might yet be saved.\r\n\r\nSoon men came rushing along. An engine turned a corner and stopped\r\nbefore a hydrant, with men jumping this way and that in the endeavor\r\nto get connections with the least possible waste of time.\r\n\r\nThe explosion must have terrified most people who heard it, since\r\nthey could not but believe it meant the destruction of some mill. It\r\nis wonderful, however, how news is flashed along from mouth to mouth\r\nduring such scenes of excitement as this; and, doubtless, when\r\npeople learned that the shock came from a desperate effort to\r\nconfine the fire to the side of the town where it had started, their\r\nhopes would take a new bound upward.\r\n\r\n“Will it force its way across in spite of everything, do you think,\r\nRob?” asked Tubby, solicitously, as he stood beside the patrol\r\nleader, and watched the working fire-fighters battling so manfully.\r\n\r\n“I hope not,” he was told, in a reassuring tone. “You can see how\r\nthey’re trying to soak the wall of that nearest factory so it can\r\nhold out against the heat when the test comes. Besides that they are\r\ngetting more water on right along. Here comes another company, and\r\nfrom the way the people keep cheering them I reckon they must belong\r\nin another town, and have been rushed here by special train.”\r\n\r\nIt afterwards turned out that Rob had actually hit the truth when he\r\nmade this guess. Word of the dreadful imperiling catastrophe that\r\nhad come upon Wyoming must have been flashed to neighboring towns by\r\ntelegraph, as well as an appeal for assistance. Such a call is never\r\nallowed to pass unheeded in American communities, and just as soon\r\nas they could get the right of way a special train with the engine\r\nand firefighters aboard had been dispatched, with the order to “burn\r\nthe rails” in making speed.\r\n\r\nThere was need of every available man and machine. The wall of fire\r\nhad by now arrived at the gap, and gave positive signs of being\r\ndisposed to leap across in order to complete its work of\r\ndestruction. Men fought madly to restrain it. Those who held the\r\nvarious lines of hose pushed forward until their faces were scorched\r\nby the heat, but in spite of all this they persisted, and would not\r\nbe denied.\r\n\r\n“They’re holding it there, mark you!” shrilled Ralph in the ear of\r\nRob Blake, as all of them stood watching these exciting happenings,\r\ntheir hearts almost in their throats, so to speak, such was the\r\nweight of their anxiety.\r\n\r\nRob was encouraged. He began to believe that after all the devoted\r\nfiremen were going to come out victors in their fierce battle with\r\nthe element that had started in to ravage the whole town of Wyoming.\r\n\r\nHe bent most of his attention on the buildings close by, for if one\r\nof them suddenly burst into flames it would mean that the worst that\r\ncould happen was about to commence.\r\n\r\nVainly did the flames dart forth, fanned by that still raging wind,\r\nand endeavor to reach the buildings that had been cut off from their\r\ngrasp by the destruction of the old factory. The more they tried,\r\nthe greater the efforts of those who held the water nozzles\r\ncontinued. Wherever a certain point was threatened there would be a\r\nconcentration of splashing fluid, and the enemy retreated, baffled\r\nagain and again.\r\n\r\nRob noticed presently that each time the fire made this attempt to\r\ncross the divide it seemed to grow just a little weaker. He knew\r\nthat the fuel by means of which it was maintained was being devoured\r\nat such a rate that, given time, the efforts of the Department would\r\nprove successful. Even now matters had reached such a stage he\r\nbelieved the worst to be over; and that victory was in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Chapter XXI\r\n\r\n                       After It Was All Over\r\n\r\n\r\n“I guess it’s all over but the shouting!” exclaimed Sim, which\r\nremark proved that he too must have noticed some of the same signs\r\ndetected by Rob.\r\n\r\n“Oh! do you really believe that?” cried Tubby, a little look of\r\nrelief appearing on his face, which lately had been screwed up in\r\nall sorts of lines denoting his strained feelings.\r\n\r\n“Well,” explained Sim, with alacrity, “you can see for yourself that\r\nso far none of the sparks have set fire to the roofs of the mills\r\nand factories, thanks to the men who are guarding the same, armed\r\nwith buckets of water. If you watch carefully you’ll learn that the\r\nblaze keeps on getting weaker right along. It’s burning itself out,\r\nI tell you, Tubby. We win, and most of the glory goes to Rob here\r\nfor thinking up such a grand scheme.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you believe that!” exclaimed the scout leader, energetically.\r\n“Nine-tenths of it ought to go to Ralph, you’d better say. Didn’t he\r\nget the apparatus for blowing up that factory, and wasn’t it Ralph\r\nwho piloted the car back home and here again, going like mad? But\r\nperhaps you had better not say anything more about that business,\r\nboys; neither of us want to pose as heroes. After all, what we did\r\nwas only the most natural thing in the world.”\r\n\r\n“Just what it was, and we’re fishing for no bouquets, either,\r\nremember,” said Ralph, who was close enough to hear all this talk.\r\n\r\nIt was now close on midnight, but no one in all Wyoming would dream\r\nof such a thing as going to bed. Some had been burned out of house\r\nand home, while all the remainder had suffered such a shock to their\r\nnerves that sleep was quite out of the question for them.\r\n\r\nThe danger was past, and every one could take a good long breath of\r\nrelief. Why, even the wind had commenced to die down now, as though\r\nconscious of its defeat in trying to aid its companion element in\r\ndestroying the bustling town.\r\n\r\nThere would be plenty of work for all the firemen until dawn,\r\npouring a continuous stream of water on the ruins of houses, and the\r\nlumberyard as well, that had been destroyed. Even when additional\r\ncompanies reached town, coming from more distant places, they were\r\nset to work rendering assistance to the stricken community; for\r\nthose gallant fellows would have been sorely chagrined if compelled\r\nto return home without a chance to even wet their hose for\r\nneighborly accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe boys knew that presently they ought to pull out and head for the\r\nfarm; but as long as Mr. Jeffords did not insist on going, it was\r\nnot their business to say the word. They felt that they would\r\nwillingly remain there for an hour and more, with so much going on\r\nto see and to hear.\r\n\r\nIt was Rob who began to exhibit signs of impatience, for, to tell\r\nthe truth, the scout leader noticed that the crowd around them had\r\nbeen growing of late; and he also discovered that a number of the\r\nmore prominent men of the town seemed to be talking very earnestly\r\nwith Mr. Jeffords.\r\n\r\nNow, Rob began to take the alarm. He fancied that these people were\r\ntalking about himself and comrades, because often he could see them\r\nlook their way, and once a stout gentleman whom Ralph had told him\r\nwas the mayor of Wyoming actually pointed in their direction.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think we’d better be starting home, Ralph?” Rob went on\r\nto say.\r\n\r\nThe other chuckled as though he could give a guess as to what was\r\nbothering his friend. At the same time he shook his head in the\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\n“We’ve just got to wait till dad gives the word, you know,” he\r\nexplained. “Now he seems to be pretty busily engaged. Just hold your\r\nhorses, Rob. The fire has been gotten fully under control, and\r\nthere’s nothing more to be feared from that source. Unless I miss my\r\nguess, the business men of this town have a duty, and a pleasant\r\nduty to perform. I don’t mean to spoil it all by running away, not\r\non your life.”\r\n\r\nRob looked uneasy, but he was powerless to do anything.\r\n\r\n“Oh! well, I suppose we’ll have to stand for it, then,” he muttered,\r\nas if making up his mind to take some punishment.\r\n\r\nRalph actually stared hard at him. Really, he had never before run\r\nacross a boy just like Rob Blake. Most of the fellows he knew would\r\nhave been only too delighted to find themselves in the limelight,\r\nand called a hero. Nevertheless, Ralph was determined that Rob\r\nshould not escape by running away.\r\n\r\n“They’re coming this way,” announced Tubby, who with Sim and Andy\r\ndoubtless had already “sensed” what was in the air, for all of them\r\nwere smiling broadly, and casting significant looks toward the\r\nplainly annoyed Rob.\r\n\r\nMr. Jeffords led the dozen citizens straight up to where the little\r\ngroup of boys stood, while a crowd pressed close around to hear what\r\nwas said.\r\n\r\n“This gentleman,” began Mr. Jeffords, “is Mr. Perkins, our worthy\r\nmayor, and these others are business men of Wyoming, some of them\r\nowners of the costly mills and factories that have been saved from\r\ndestruction through a brilliant and bold scheme. I have explained to\r\nthem that though the dynamite that saved the town belonged to me,\r\nand while it was my son Ralph who drove the car to the farm to\r\nsecure it, still the conception of the grand idea was wholly Rob\r\nBlake’s. They want to congratulate you, my boy, on your bright\r\nthought, and to thank you publicly for having been so instrumental\r\nin saving our town from utter destruction.”\r\n\r\nRob opened his mouth to protest, but the stout mayor waved to him\r\nthat he had a few words to say; so the boy shrugged his shoulders\r\nand held his breath. If they were so insistent, how was he to help\r\nhimself? Nevertheless, he could not think it fair that more of the\r\ncredit should be placed at his door than was given to resourceful\r\nRalph, who, once given the hint, had engineered the whole thing.\r\n\r\n“I want to thank you, Rob Blake,” said the mayor, squeezing the\r\nboy’s hand in his chubby palm, “in the name of all our people. Only\r\nfor your quick wit and ready brain we might at this minute be\r\nwitnessing the destruction of all our thriving industries, and\r\nWyoming would have been as thoroughly blotted out as some of those\r\npoor Belgian and French communities have been before the vandal guns\r\nof the warring Nations. And while I am about it I mean also to thank\r\nRalph Jeffords because of the valuable aid he gave once you\r\nconceived the scheme of blowing up that building. Yes, let me also\r\nshake hands with these other three lads here who wear the khaki, for\r\nI feel sure that had you not been present, one of them would have\r\ndiscovered some way to accomplish the same purpose you had in view.”\r\n\r\nEven Tubby blushed at the compliment. Plainly, then, these good\r\npeople of Wyoming were of an entirely different mind concerning\r\nthose who wore the khaki. Not so very long since, according to\r\nRalph, and they had settled in their minds that scouts were an\r\nundesirable organization in a community, just because the first\r\nattempt to raise a troop had been a failure, owing to the wrong sort\r\nof leadership, and the poor class of lads enlisted under the colors.\r\n\r\n“It may be that you boys have heard about the failure that overtook\r\na troop of scouts started in our town some time back,” continued the\r\nmayor, and at that Rob began to show much more interest than when he\r\nhimself had been the object of attention. “But some of us are now of\r\nthe opinion that we were wrong in condemning all wearers of the\r\nkhaki because our own lads failed to equal our ambitions. I am sure\r\nI voice the sentiments of this entire community when I say that\r\nafter having this lesson brought home to us we realize that we have\r\nmade a great mistake. For one, I am in favor of urging that a troop\r\nof scouts be started here in Wyoming without delay, founded on the\r\nbroad and noble principles of your order; and here and now I pledge\r\nyou that my two boys shall become charter members. And I also hope\r\nvery much that Ralph Jeffords will consent to take this enterprise\r\nin hand. All in favor of this say aye!”\r\n\r\nThere came a unanimous shout from the assembled crowd, who had been\r\nlistening in absorbed attention while the mayor was talking.\r\n\r\nAfter that other gentlemen came up, desirous of shaking hands with\r\nthe boys who chanced to be visiting at the Jeffords’ farm. Evidently\r\nthe story of how the scouts had been instrumental in tracking the\r\nlost child, and restoring little Caleb to his nearly distracted\r\nmother may have been brought to the town, for several of the men\r\nmentioned something about it as they warmly greeted Rob and Sim and\r\nAndy and Tubby.\r\n\r\nWith such a wonderful background as that still burning section of\r\nthe town the picture was a striking one, which Tubby felt sure he\r\nwould never, never forget. He was particularly pleased that they had\r\ncornered Rob, because on more than one former occasion Tubby had\r\nknown the patrol leader to slip away after having been instrumental\r\nin accomplishing things worth while, just because he could not bear\r\nto hear people making him out to be more than an ordinary boy.\r\n\r\nOn his part, Rob was delighted to learn of the change that had come\r\nover the good people of Wyoming with regard to their opinion of\r\nscouts in general. They had seen a light, evidently, and would know\r\nfrom this time on that those who wear the honored khaki, if they are\r\ntrue scouts, are bound to be a credit to the community in which they\r\ndwell.\r\n\r\nRalph, too, looked pleased. To tell the truth, ever since the coming\r\nof his cousin Sim, and his acquaintance with such a fine fellow as\r\nRob Blake, Ralph had been wondering whether it would not be worth\r\nwhile to make another attempt to organize a troop in Wyoming, if\r\nsufficient encouragement could be received from leading citizens,\r\nand the men at Scout Headquarters were also willing.\r\n\r\nNow it seemed that matters had been taken out of his hands by this\r\nstrange happening, and the peril that had threatened the town.\r\nInstead of it being Ralph who spent his time in going around and\r\nbeseeching citizens to allow their boys to join in with him so as to\r\nform a new organization, it was the mayor himself who gave the word,\r\nand even promised that his two sons should enroll their names among\r\nthe very first candidates.\r\n\r\nPlainly, then, Rob and his chums had been able to show what scouts\r\nare worth to any community and had made a deep and lasting\r\nimpression on these people; it would not be long before their visit\r\nmust begin to bear fruit to the honor of the whole organization.\r\n\r\nNow that this ceremony had been carried through, perhaps Mr.\r\nJeffords would be willing that they start for home. Rob was\r\nbeginning to feel that a bed would not be unpleasant, for all of\r\nthem had been up very early on the preceding day, and so much had\r\ntaken place since then that they were tired.\r\n\r\nTubby, too, was commencing to yawn, which was a pretty good sign\r\nthat he could not hold out much longer. All of them, in fact, were\r\nglad when Ralph’s father came back and announced that they had\r\nbetter start out to find the car, which it was to be hoped had not\r\nbeen taken by any of the fleeing people.\r\n\r\nThis worried Tubby somewhat, for he wondered whether they would be\r\nable to hire a rig, or another car in case their own had been taken.\r\nAll anxiety on this score, however, was soon set at rest, for as\r\nthey drew near the spot where Ralph had abandoned the auto they\r\ndiscovered it still there near the curb.\r\n\r\nThey quickly found seats, Sim occupying one of the extra ones. So\r\nthey started forth, and many times did Andy, Tubby and Sim crane\r\ntheir necks to look back toward Wyoming; but the angry glow had\r\nfaded from the heavens by now, and stars were beginning to show\r\nthemselves here and there through the clouds.\r\n\r\n“Well, after all, we’ve gone and forgotten Peleg!” announced Tubby,\r\npresently. “Too bad, and I hope he doesn’t have to tramp all of\r\nthose ten miles out to the farm.” But Rob somehow found himself\r\nbelieving that Peleg had purposely kept away from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Chapter XXII\r\n\r\n                            Laying Plans\r\n\r\n\r\n“Did anybody happen to see Peleg after the fire broke out?” called\r\nRalph, over his shoulder, as he continued to pilot the big car, the\r\nheadlights showing him all inequalities in the road, so that he\r\ncould avoid most of the “bumps.”\r\n\r\n“I did,” spoke up Andy, immediately. “Let’s see, I think it was just\r\nabout the time that fat mayor was going around shaking hands with\r\nus, and giving us that taffy about his change of heart regarding the\r\nscouts.”\r\n\r\n“Then Peleg should have known we meant to clear out pretty soon,”\r\ninterrupted Tubby, slowly, “so if he had a particle of sense, and\r\nreally wanted to come back home in the car with the crowd, why,\r\nseems to me he’d have hung around.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he didn’t,” added Andy. “I saw him grinning as though tickled\r\nhalf to death about something. Perhaps now it pleased him to see\r\nthat mayor grabbing our hands so,--well,--I might say effusively. How\r\nabout that, Ralph; would Peleg care if he saw you being patted on\r\nthe back, and made a hero of?”\r\n\r\n“He might, and then again perhaps it was something else that made\r\nhim seem so happy,” replied Ralph.\r\n\r\nThe other boys may not have understood the real meaning of those\r\nwords, but Rob did. He knew Ralph was hinting to him that the farm\r\nboy may have held back from joining them because he began to feel\r\nashamed of what he had done, and could not bear to face the owner of\r\nthe stolen stamps so soon after selling the packets to the curio\r\ndealer.\r\n\r\nEven that failed wholly to convince Rob. When he believed in any one\r\nit was hard to make him change his opinion. Why should Peleg seem so\r\nwell satisfied with himself? Surely, the getting of a few dollars,\r\nmore or less, in a shady transaction too, of which he must later on\r\nfeel ashamed, would hardly cause him to appear so happy.\r\n\r\nRob confessed that he could not make it out at all. He was really\r\ntoo tired to continue bothering his brains over the puzzle.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps tomorrow, when Peleg comes home again, we may find out what\r\nit all means,” he told himself. “There’s no way of finding out right\r\nnow; and so what’s the use fussing with it?”\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Rob put the affair out of his mind. If it came to the\r\nworst there was a speedy way of learning the truth, just as Ralph\r\nhad mentioned; by going to town again, with the excuse that he\r\nwanted to see what Wyoming looked like after the great\r\nconflagration, Ralph could drop in and see the curio dealer. Being\r\nready to buy back the stamps, if Peleg had really sold them, he\r\ncould influence Mr. Hardman to return the stolen property.\r\n\r\nThey made the little journey back to the farm without incident.\r\nRalph did not attempt anything like speed in covering the ten or\r\nmore miles. Twice that same night he had raced like mad over that\r\ncourse, escaping disaster several times only by a narrow margin.\r\nRalph did not care to accept the same risks again when there was no\r\nsense in it.\r\n\r\nRob, however, would not soon forget both of those hurried trips,\r\nwith that ominous glare in the heavens to spur the driver on.\r\n\r\nArriving home, they soon sought their beds, for it was a pretty\r\ntired lot of fellows who came back after such a tempestuous\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nLittle talking was indulged in, at Rob’s suggestion. They could\r\nleave that for the morning, when they would be refreshed, and able\r\nto discuss all details connected with the night of terror.\r\n\r\nWhen morning came it proved to be a fine opening, for the sun arose\r\nin a clear sky, despite the threat of rain during the earlier part\r\nof the preceding night.\r\n\r\nThey had hardly finished breakfast, and were trying to lay out a\r\nprogramme for the day, when the man Pete, who was in charge of\r\nRalph’s queer fur farm showed up. Rob understood from his manner\r\nthat something unusual must have caused him to pay this early\r\nmorning visit to the farmhouse, for as a rule he cooked his own\r\nmeals up at the other station, sleeping there as well.\r\n\r\nWhen Ralph had had a little talk with him he came over to where the\r\nrest of the boys were sitting on the porch.\r\n\r\n“Well, more trouble in prospect up at my fox farm,” Ralph remarked.\r\n\r\n“Another cat bobbed up, Ralph?” asked Rob, immediately. “I mention\r\nthat because I happen to know as a rule where you run across one\r\nyou’ll also find its mate, for they generally hunt in couples.”\r\n\r\nRalph nodded his head, and made a wry face.\r\n\r\n“You’re on, Rob,” he replied. “Pete heard the critter screeching\r\nover in the woods last night. Then this morning he found where it\r\nhad entered my preserves, and he thinks it must have got away with\r\none of my fox pups, for he saw signs of blood and fur on the ground.\r\nBut, anyhow, whether that’s so or not, we’ve got to get after Mr.\r\nCat, and keep it up till we bag him. There’ll be no peace as long as\r\nhe hangs out around my fur farm.”\r\n\r\n“Will Pete go out and try to shoot this one like he did the last?”\r\nasked Tubby, remembering the fresh skin that had been fastened to a\r\nstretching board, and hung on the shady side of the cottage to dry\r\nin the air away from the sun.\r\n\r\n“He’ll keep on the move right along, with his gun on his shoulder,”\r\nexplained Ralph. “But his running across the first rascal was a big\r\npiece of luck. This time I’ll have to try and fix a trap for the\r\nbeast. Since there’s no time like the present, I think I’ll get busy\r\nnow. Who wants to go up with me?”\r\n\r\nThere was a unanimous assent, showing that all of them felt a deep\r\ninterest in this part of the proceedings. So, leaving the farmhouse,\r\nthey strolled along in the direction of the fur farm, away off at\r\nthe upper part of Mr. Jeffords’ extensive property holdings.\r\n\r\nPete went with them, and on the way detailed once more, for the\r\nbenefit of the scouts, how he had heard the screech of the cat not\r\nfar from break of day. He had known that something far out of the\r\ncommon was taking place down at Wyoming, for he had seen the flame\r\nin the sky, and even caught something of the clamor that accompanied\r\nthe fire; but his duty was to stay and guard Ralph’s valuable\r\nproperty, so Pete had resisted the temptation to start toward town.\r\n\r\nIn return, the boys described some of the wonderful sights that had\r\ncome their way while watching the town burning. Pete was also\r\ninformed concerning the fortunate inspiration that had come to Rob,\r\nfollowing out which the dynamite had been used to baffle the fire\r\nfiend. Ralph it was who told most of this, apparently much to the\r\nconfusion of Rob, who several times tried to throw the praise on the\r\nshoulders of the one who had piloted the car back and forth, laid\r\nthe explosives without a hitch, and certainly merited a big share of\r\nthe successful outcome.\r\n\r\nOnce they were at the cottage where Pete held forth, Ralph began to\r\noverhaul a number of rusty traps which he apparently had not touched\r\nfor some time.\r\n\r\n“Three winters ago,” he told them, “I used to do quite a good deal\r\nof trapping, and learned a whole lot about the habits of such wild\r\nanimals as we have around this section of the Adirondacks. Then I\r\ngot that fur-farm fever, and read up all the articles I could find\r\nabout the raising of black foxes, and such things. Well, after that\r\nI didn’t care to trap common stock, and so I haven’t done a thing at\r\nit since. So my traps look pretty seedy; but they’ll work, all\r\nright. Pete, the first chance you get, give these things a good\r\noiling. No use having them go to the scrap heap for nothing.”\r\n\r\nHe picked out a certain trap, and said it would answer their\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n“It must be set outside the boundaries of my enclosure,” Ralph\r\ncontinued, when Tubby had suggested that one of the foxes or mink\r\nmight be caught, “and I’m depending a whole lot on Pete to show me\r\nthe right place. The cat will likely come back again tonight, and\r\nfollow the same path to the high fence. We’ll set the trap now,\r\nbecause even in the daytime a hungry cat often starts out to get a\r\nmeal.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I’ve met them in the woods when the sun was shining brightly,”\r\nsaid Rob. “Hunger causes even animals who see best in the dark to\r\nroam around during daylight. But I agree with you, Ralph, when you\r\nfigure that your trap is more apt to wind up the cat’s career than\r\nPete’s gun.”\r\n\r\nAll of them went forth to see the trap set, Pete leading them to\r\nwhere he had reason to believe the animal had crossed the boundary\r\nline of the preserves. Tubby in particular watched every move Ralph\r\nmade when setting the trap; for Tubby knew next to nothing about\r\nsuch things, never having had an opportunity to visit the woods\r\nduring fur season.\r\n\r\nAfter this had been duly attended to, they once more took a look\r\naround the fur farm, and then sauntered back to the house. Rob was\r\nwondering what Ralph intended doing with regard to finding an answer\r\nconnected with the stamp disappearance mystery. He fully anticipated\r\nthat the other would announce his intended departure for the town,\r\nand asking whether any of them would care to go along. But the\r\nmorning passed away, and nothing was said or done.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Andy and Tubby went fishing, the stout scout seeming to\r\nhave taken a great liking for the sport. Considering the fact that\r\nhe was “high notch” so far, having captured the largest bass yet\r\ntaken, this was not to be wondered at.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to ask you to do me a favor, Rob,” remarked Ralph as they\r\nsat there on the porch, Sim being at some other part of the premises\r\njust then, having accompanied his uncle to see a new patent churn\r\nthat he had installed in the milk cellar.\r\n\r\n“Now he’s going to bring up the subject of Peleg again,” thought\r\nRob; but for once he was mistaken, since Ralph did nothing of the\r\nsort.\r\n\r\n“I’m getting to be a whole lot interested in that flashlight picture\r\ngame,” he went on to say; “and I’d like to see how you work it, if\r\nyou don’t object.”\r\n\r\n“Why, that would be easy enough,” the scout leader told him, much\r\ngratified, “for I happen to have the apparatus in my bag. You see,\r\nat the last minute I got an idea we might want to take a few\r\npictures of that sort, and so I chucked it in. What kind of animal\r\nhave you in mind, Ralph?”\r\n\r\n“Well, my mink interest me more than anything else,” came the reply;\r\n“partly because they are so shy that you can hardly ever get a\r\nglimpse of the little rascals. I don’t know near as much about their\r\nhabits as I’d like, though as a trapper I understood where to set my\r\ntraps in order to catch them visiting in and out of the holes along\r\nthe banks of a creek.”\r\n\r\n“All right, then, if you say the word we can set a snare tonight\r\nthat may bring results,” Rob continued. “I don’t know that I ever\r\ngot a good picture of a mink, and it would please me to manage it\r\nthat way.”\r\n\r\nStill nothing was said about Peleg, although Rob had incidentally\r\nasked some time before if the boy had shown up at the farm, to learn\r\nthat nothing had as yet been seen of him.\r\n\r\nApparently Ralph had not as yet made up his mind concerning a visit\r\nto town. It might be that the strenuous events of the preceding\r\nnight were still too vivid in his mind for him to desire to see how\r\nWyoming looked after the fire. Rob, on his part, had no intention of\r\ninfluencing the other to take a run in, knowing as he did that this\r\nwould mean a trip to the curio dealer, and possibly finding out\r\ncertain unpleasant truths concerning Peleg.\r\n\r\nThe two fishermen came back in the car, which Andy had been able to\r\nrun, just as the lunch bell sounded. Rob knew as soon as he saw them\r\nthat something out of the usual run must have happened, for both\r\nlooked mysterious and excited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Chapter XXIII\r\n\r\n                         Just Between Boys\r\n\r\n\r\n“Why, they’re all wet, boys, if you’ll believe me!” exclaimed Sim,\r\nas soon as Tubby and Andy arrived in the car.\r\n\r\nTubby got out, laboriously, and then proceeded to exhibit as fine a\r\nstring of bass as the heart of any enthusiastic angler could wish.\r\n\r\n“But the biggest got away from us, I’m sorry to say,” he remarked.\r\n“’Course I know well enough that that’s an _awful_ old excuse, but\r\nin this case it’s a fact. Our condition proves it, too. I held on\r\nlike grim death, even after he upset the boat, and, say, he dragged\r\nme under twice, and then--shucks! the line broke. I guess he snagged\r\nit on a sharp rock. These bass are mighty smart fish, I’m finding\r\nout.”\r\n\r\nAndy was grinning, as though it may have been something of a\r\n“circus” to him even if he had also been thrown into the water by\r\nthe capsizing of their cranky boat when the clumsy Tubby became\r\nexcited with such a large fish on his hook.\r\n\r\n“Believe me, it was a lively time,” he admitted. “Tubby was\r\nswimming, and spouting the water out of his mouth like a whale, all\r\nthe while holding on to his rod, and trying to yell. I think he\r\nwould have landed that monster bass if only the line hadn’t gone\r\nback on him. He was the most disappointed fellow you ever saw when\r\nhe found his prize had skipped out.”\r\n\r\n“Were you far from the shore, and what did you do?” asked Rob.\r\n\r\n“It happened that we were fishing past that big rock where Tubby\r\ncaught his other noble bass,” explained Andy. “So we didn’t have far\r\nto swim, pushing the boat between us. I knew that was the easiest\r\nway to manage, because Tubby would have had a tough job climbing\r\nover the stern.”\r\n\r\n“Huh! must have weighed nearly a ton with my soaked clothes,” the\r\nfat boy agreed. “But we didn’t lose anything, except a hook, and\r\nthat monster bass. It wasn’t such a terrible experience, either. If\r\nthe day had been chilly at all we’d have started a fire, and dried\r\nout; but neither of us cared to bother going to all that trouble; so\r\nwe baled out the boat, and just commenced fishing again; but I never\r\ngot another bully strike like that one.”\r\n\r\nThey were not feeling uncomfortable in the least; as their clothes\r\nhad by this time pretty well dried out upon their backs, neither of\r\nthe boys took the trouble to make any change.\r\n\r\n“I’m too hungry to wait a minute,” announced Tubby, showing that he\r\nhad heard the summons to lunch as the car approached the farmhouse.\r\n\r\nIt was high noon, and still no Peleg. Rob continued to wonder what\r\ncould be keeping the farm boy in town. Still, it was a good ten mile\r\ntramp in case he thought to make it afoot. On the other hand, Rob\r\nthought he might be waiting for a chance to ride with some farmer\r\nreturning home, and that the opportunity may not as yet have come\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n“What, no frogs’ legs today?” remarked Tubby, when the meal had\r\nprogressed far enough to show this lack of his favorite delicacy.\r\n\r\n“Oh! we’ve decided to leave all that to you, Tubby,” laughed Ralph.\r\n“It seems that the rest of us have had all we want of that\r\nfish-chicken combination. There’s the pond, and whenever you feel\r\nlike having a mess take my Flobert and get busy. The rest of us have\r\nother fish to fry.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the programme for this afternoon?” asked Sim.\r\n\r\nRob looked toward Ralph, fully expecting to hear the other suggest\r\nthat they go to town. Again he was mistaken, for nothing of the kind\r\ncame about.\r\n\r\n“Why,” Ralph started to say, “father has asked me to take the car\r\nand run over to Flemington to attend to some business that needs\r\nlooking after. If any or all of you feel like going along, now’s\r\nyour chance to say the word. There’ll be room for you, and it’s\r\nworth going thirty miles uphill and down, for you’ll get some mighty\r\nfine views. How about you, Rob?”\r\n\r\n“I’m game if the rest are,” came the ready reply.\r\n\r\nIn rapid succession Tubby, Sim and Andy announced themselves willing\r\nto take part in the excursion. It would show them a section of\r\ncountry that was new; and promised to be quite an enjoyable\r\ndiversion. Evidently, then, Rob concluded, Ralph did not mean to\r\nlook that curio dealer up in a hurry, so as to settle the question\r\nof Peleg’s innocence or guilt.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t be much surprised,” Rob told himself, “if Ralph sort of\r\nshrinks at doing that. He would like to get his stamps back, but\r\nwhile the case is open and unsettled he can try and convince himself\r\nthat the boy isn’t guilty. Once he has the proof dead to rights and\r\nPeleg must go. It does Ralph a whole lot of credit, this trying to\r\ngive the boy all the chance he can.”\r\n\r\nThey certainly had a glorious run of it on the way to Flemington,\r\nand the scenery was all that the enthusiastic Ralph had promised. He\r\nalso managed to return by another roundabout road, so that they\r\ncould see still another section of country.\r\n\r\n“Ralph, slow up, won’t you?” suddenly called out Sim, who was\r\nsitting on the back seat. “I want to get a better look at something\r\nthrough the trees over here on the right. There, I saw him again,\r\nand now I’m dead sure of it.”\r\n\r\n“Why, it certainly does look mighty much like our Peleg,” agreed\r\nTubby, who had also managed to crane his fat neck so as to obtain a\r\npassing view; “but whatever would he be doing away over here, a long\r\nway from your place; and he seemed to be driving a horse and buggy,\r\ntoo. Ralph, what do you know about this?”\r\n\r\nRalph stopped the car, and also glanced back, for as he had to keep\r\nhis eyes on the road most of the time, it was not easy for him to\r\nturn around, lest by so doing he land them in a ditch.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s Peleg,” he announced, presently, and Rob could see that\r\nthe altogether strange appearance of the farm boy over in this\r\nsection when he should have turned up at the Jeffords’ place\r\nsurprised Ralph.\r\n\r\n“What do you reckon he’s doing over here?” continued Tubby, bound to\r\n“pump” the other until Ralph yielded up all the information at his\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\n“Well, I can explain that part of it,” was the reply. “You see,\r\nPeleg’s sister is working out at that house where he’s going right\r\nnow. Evidently Peleg has hired that rig in town for the purpose of\r\npaying his sister a visit.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! seeing that he was off work, he must have just made up his mind\r\nhe might as well be killed for a sheep as a lamb; is that it,\r\nRalph?” demanded Tubby.\r\n\r\n“Something like it, I guess,” answered the other, at the same time\r\ngiving Rob at his side a queer look, together with a frown.\r\n\r\nRob could easily guess what was passing through the mind of the boy\r\nat the wheel of the car; he believed that Peleg must be spending the\r\nmoney he had received for those packets of foreign stamps in paying\r\nfor the horse and buggy with which he was driving over to see his\r\nsister.\r\n\r\nIt was not a pleasant thought to Rob. He wished the whole affair\r\nwould make haste to reach a settlement; if Peleg were guilty, the\r\nsooner the fact became known to Ralph the better; if, on the other\r\nhand, he could prove his innocence, it was too bad to keep up this\r\nfeeling of suspicion.\r\n\r\nThey started on again. So far as they knew, Peleg had not once\r\nlooked toward the road as he drove up along the lane leading to the\r\nfarmhouse just beyond the brow of the rise. Apparently he was at the\r\ntime so excited over the thought of seeing his sister again that he\r\nhad eyes and ears for nothing else; and the mere passing of a car\r\nheld no attraction for him. Rob thought it was just as well, for\r\nPeleg might have signalled to them; and in some way Ralph was likely\r\nto burst forth, perhaps openly accusing the boy in the presence of\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nSo they went on. Ralph kept his thoughts to himself, not even\r\nspeaking of Peleg to Rob at his side. The others, very naturally,\r\ncontinued to exchange remarks that Ralph could not help hearing\r\nabove the purr of the engine.\r\n\r\n“Well, anyhow,” Tubby was saying, with his accustomed zeal, “I’m\r\nglad to know he wasn’t hurt any in the fire. When he failed to show\r\nup at the time we were leaving I felt worried. Lots of people got\r\ninjured, I’m sure, for the crowd acted like it was crazy, running\r\nback and forth, and knocking everybody over who got in the way.”\r\n\r\n“Peleg is all right, we know now,” interjected Andy. “He’s wanted to\r\nsee this sister of his for some time, I reckon, and took this chance\r\nto get around. Oh! look at that bull chasing after that dog in the\r\nfield, will you? The little barker is too smart for the clumsy\r\nbeast; but if ever he gets those horns underneath him, I give you my\r\nword for it he’ll clear thirty feet in the air if he does one.”\r\n\r\nLittle escaped their eyes as they rode along. First one and then\r\nanother would call attention to something of interest that was seen,\r\nnow on the right and again on the left. Tubby even declared that he\r\nwas beginning to believe he had a regular “rubber-neck,” they kept\r\nhim looking so much.\r\n\r\nBack at the farm again, they lounged around the balance of the\r\nafternoon. Ralph often looked along the road they had so recently\r\ndriven over, and Rob made up his mind that the other was hoping to\r\nsee Peleg coming. To his mind this proved that while Ralph had kept\r\nunusually quiet on the subject, he was still worrying about the\r\nstatus of the farm boy.\r\n\r\nIt was getting along toward sunset when finally Ralph, as if unable\r\nto longer hold in, introduced the subject himself.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the fact that he and Rob chanced to be alone at the time had\r\nsomething to do with it. They were looking over the flashlight\r\napparatus, which the owner had been explaining to Ralph, who agreed\r\nthat the manipulation of the little “trick” was simplicity itself,\r\nand could be easily managed by any one with a fair degree of\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n“It begins to look to me as though Peleg knows he must be under\r\nsuspicion, and doesn’t mean to come back to work here, much as I\r\nhate to believe that, Rob,” was what he said, watching the face of\r\nhis companion so as to read his opinion even before the other made\r\nany sort of reply.\r\n\r\n“Oh! I wouldn’t say that until you know more about his actions,” Rob\r\ntold him. “You yourself said he had a queer and powerful affection\r\nfor his brothers and sisters. His going out there today proves that,\r\ntoo. Now as a scout I’ve been taught never to believe wrong of any\r\none unless the proof is overwhelming; and even then to try and think\r\nthe best you can of him, perhaps by your influence causing him to\r\nrepent and make restitution.”\r\n\r\n“I understand what you mean, Rob,” muttered the other, “and if Peleg\r\nreally showed any sign of being sorry for what he has done, I’d\r\nforgive him, and keep his secret. I’m not one of the hard kind to\r\nhold a thing against any chap, because I know we’re not all alike.\r\nPeleg, being tempted, would mean ten times the strain on his honesty\r\nthat the same thing would to me. Yes, I’ve already made up my mind\r\nto go easy with him.”\r\n\r\nRob was glad to hear this. At the same time he still hoped there\r\nwould be no occasion to exercise this clemency on the part of his\r\nfriend. It was pleasant for him to know Ralph was that sort of boy;\r\nand he believed the other would make a model member of the new scout\r\ntroop, when it was organized in Wyoming.\r\n\r\n“There’s just one more thing I want to say, Rob,” the other remarked\r\nwhen they were about to pass out again to the open air, and join the\r\nrest of the fellows on the shady porch. “Meeting you has been a\r\nrevelation to me, and given me a lot of new ideas. And let me tell\r\nyou I’ve never known any one who had such faith in finding a streak\r\nof good in every boy that lives!”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Rob with a laugh, “that’s easy enough when you figure out\r\nyour own struggles between right and wrong. All boys pass through\r\nthe same, more or less.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Chapter XXIV\r\n\r\n                      The Answer to the Puzzle\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter supper that night Ralph and Rob went off to set the flashlight\r\ntrap in the mink enclosure. A fresh fish would be the bait to\r\nattract one of the timid little fur-bearing animals to the place;\r\nand the arrangement was such that when he attempted to possess\r\nhimself of the tempting morsel, the pull upon a cord would cause the\r\nflashlight to snap off his picture before he could move.\r\n\r\nRalph was very much interested in the venture, and asked enough\r\nquestions to give him all necessary information. Apparently he had\r\ntaken a great fancy for this new method of “hunting with a camera,”\r\nand would possibly amuse himself frequently later on in securing\r\nvarious pictures that could not otherwise be obtained.\r\n\r\nWhen they got back, somewhere around nine o’clock, Tubby “wanted to\r\nknow,” as he usually did.\r\n\r\n“How about that old bobcat, Ralph? Signs of him taking the bait you\r\nleft out there for him?” he went on to inquire.\r\n\r\n“We didn’t bother going to see,” he was told. “He’s got the whole\r\nnight before him to come around. So I’m just living off hope until\r\nPete makes his report in the morning. I’d hate to have my plans all\r\nknocked silly by the accidental coming of a pair of cats.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve got to remember,” Rob warned him, “to set your alarm clock\r\nso you can wake up at three o’clock. You must be on hand before the\r\nfirst streak of dawn, because if the light strikes in before you get\r\nthere the flashlight picture will be ruined.”\r\n\r\n“Seems to me,” observed Tubby, thoughtfully, “there ought to be some\r\nlittle mechanical invention calculated to close the opening of a\r\ncamera after just so many seconds have elapsed.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps there is,” Rob went on to say, “but if so I haven’t got the\r\nattachment on my camera. Better get up one yourself, Tubby; there\r\nwould be money in it.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll think it over,” the stout boy told them. “Sometimes I suspect\r\nthat I might make something of a success as an inventor; but so far\r\nthings I’ve tried to do just don’t seem to work a little bit. I even\r\nexperimented on a flying machine that was going to beat all these\r\ncommon aeroplanes, and leave them at the stake. But I own up that it\r\nwouldn’t budge me off the ground.”\r\n\r\n“Which I should say was the most fortunate thing that ever happened\r\nto you, Tubby,” chuckled Andy. “Falling overboard in the lake is bad\r\nenough, but then you can swim or float; but just think what would\r\nfollow if that flying machine ever gave out while you were away up\r\nin the air. Some of the fellows used to call you Punkin once in a\r\nwhile, but believe me your name would be Squash then.”\r\n\r\nOnce again it was morning, after another pleasant experience in\r\nwhich the boys managed to secure enough sleep to make up for the\r\nloss of the preceding night.\r\n\r\nRob, after getting out, wandered around to the barns to see the cows\r\nbeing milked, and the pigs fed, as well as the chickens and turkeys\r\nand ducks. He loved to watch the big bronze gobbler strut around,\r\nand make all those strange sounds as his wings scraped the ground.\r\nThen the lordly peacocks on the ridge-pole of the big barn emitted a\r\nseries of shrill cries as they preened their glorious plumage. When\r\none of them chose to strut in all his glory on the ground, Rob\r\nthought it was a most astonishing sight.\r\n\r\n“Did Peleg happen to come back last night?” he asked one of the men\r\nwho was drawing the milk from a fine Jersey cow; Mr. Jeffords wanted\r\nrichness rather than quantity, which was the reason he preferred\r\nthat strain to the banded Holsteins.\r\n\r\n“I guess not,” came the answer--“leastways, I ain’t seen anything ov\r\nhim around since the boy rode into town with the lot ov you t’other\r\nevenin’.”\r\n\r\nAll of which only added to the mystery. Still, another day had come,\r\nand perhaps they would see something of Peleg before nightfall.\r\nSince it was known that he had been within seven miles of the farm\r\non the preceding day, while visiting his sister, there was a\r\nlikelihood of his turning up. Rob was beginning to feel that he\r\nwanted to see the end of this little mystery. Innocent or guilty, he\r\ncertainly hoped Peleg would come along before the time set for their\r\ndeparture arrived.\r\n\r\nJust then he sighted Ralph returning. He held the camera safely\r\nunder his arm, and if the smile on his face stood for anything, Rob\r\nfelt justified in believing that the little venture must have met\r\nwith success.\r\n\r\n“You got there before the light did, I hope?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes, just the first peep was coming over in the east when I\r\narrived and took up the camera. Your scheme worked, too, Rob,\r\nbecause the bait was gone, and the flashlight cartridge had been\r\nfired in the pan.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll find out after breakfast whether the snapshot is any good,”\r\nthe scout leader suggested. “If this one proves to be poor, we can\r\ntry again tonight, if no signs of rain warn us off. You never can\r\ntell what you get until you develop your film or plate. Some of the\r\nfinest exposures I ever took were desperate chances, and that made\r\nthe surprise all the more agreeable.”\r\n\r\nLater on Rob developed the plate in his daylight tank, and soon\r\nassured the anxious Ralph, who, strange to say, had up to then never\r\ncared for photography, that they had secured a splendid negative. It\r\nshowed the cautious mink clearly in the act of taking the fish bait.\r\n\r\n“I do believe it’s my old Jinks, as I named the first mature mink I\r\nmanaged to get hold of!” exclaimed Ralph, minutely examining the\r\nbright negative. “Why, you can see the hair on his back, the detail\r\nwork is so perfect. Rob, I’m going to like this thing more than I\r\ncan tell you. It opens up a new field for me, and one that seems to\r\nbe just to my taste.”\r\n\r\n“Best of all,” added the patrol leader, “it doesn’t make any inroads\r\non the harmless little animals of the woods and swamps. You can get\r\nthem at home, and learn more about their nocturnal habits than by\r\nany other known means.”\r\n\r\nAfter the negative had been dried later on in the day, Rob printed\r\nseveral copies, and passed them around. Even Mr. Jeffords declared\r\nthey were very fine, and when he learned how his boy had begun to\r\ntake a great interest in the modern way of making the acquaintance\r\nof the timid woods folks, he encouraged Ralph in every way possible\r\nto enlist in the cause.\r\n\r\n“Things like this always go to make boys more humane,” the farmer\r\nremarked. “That counts a whole lot. As a rule, they are apt to have\r\ncruel instincts, handed down from their ancestors, who used to have\r\nto depend on killing game to keep themselves alive. It’s about time\r\nsomething were done to soften some of those savage traits; and I\r\nbelieve your organization of scouts will do this without making boys\r\nsoft, or sissies at the same time.”\r\n\r\nPlainly, the seed had fallen on good ground these days around\r\nWyoming. It seemed to be a foregone conclusion that before a great\r\nwhile there would spring up an enthusiastic troop of scouts bound to\r\nbe a credit to the community.\r\n\r\nThat whole day passed and still there was no sign of the absent one.\r\nSome of the fellows spoke of it as a strange thing, and also went so\r\nfar as to hint to Ralph that it looked as though Peleg may have\r\nconcluded he didn’t care to work on the Jeffords’ farm any longer.\r\n\r\nRob noticed that Ralph declined to be drawn into any discussion that\r\nhad for its subject the doings of Peleg Pinder. He just shut his\r\nteeth together, and made no comment when Tubby and Andy started\r\ndiscussing this matter. At the same time Rob was quite positive\r\nRalph had not forgotten; and he imagined that when another day came\r\nhe might make up his mind to start toward Wyoming, bent on settling\r\nthe bothersome question once and for all.\r\n\r\nDuring the day no word had come from Pete, so it could be set down\r\nas pretty certain that the second wildcat had not been hovering\r\naround the preserves where Ralph was trying to raise fancy-priced\r\nfur.\r\n\r\n“If anything had happened we would have heard,” the owner of the fox\r\nfarm told the rest of the boys. “Pete had orders to drop down and\r\nlet me know. I’m just about fixing a little telephone service\r\nbetween my cabin up there and the home place here, so we can talk\r\nwithout all this running back and forth.”\r\n\r\n“Queer how you didn’t think of that long ago,” said Sim. “I’d have\r\ndone it in the start.”\r\n\r\n“Well, the fact of the matter is,” laughed Ralph, “I put every\r\ndollar I could scrape together or borrow from dad into my first\r\nblacks; and the fencing of that big tract cost a whopping sum\r\nbesides. But now I begin to see an outlook ahead; and I’ve also\r\nconvinced father that there’s money in the project, so he’s loaning\r\nme another bunch of money.”\r\n\r\n“When do you expect to realize something from the sale of skins?”\r\nasked Tubby.\r\n\r\n“This winter,” he was told. “I think I shall put over half a dozen\r\nblack pelts by that time, some of which ought to fetch nearly top\r\nprices, because the animals are beauts. Then I’ve got a lot of\r\nskunks to get rid of, for they’ve increased rapidly. Needn’t turn\r\npale, Tubby, because I won’t be raiding their den while you’re\r\nwithin hundreds of miles of here, so you’re safe. The mink and otter\r\nhave yet to prove their value as producers of their species. If all\r\nturns out well there, in another year or so I’ll be on the high-road\r\nto success, and a big one in the bargain.”\r\n\r\nAll this was very interesting to the other boys. And from time to\r\ntime that evening as they sat around they asked additional questions\r\nconnected with the unique enterprise that Ralph was engineering,\r\nsurely one of the most remarkable that any wideawake American lad\r\nhad ever engaged in.\r\n\r\nRalph and Rob had been up again to see that the trap for the wildcat\r\nwas properly set. They also had a short chat with Pete, who did not\r\nseem to be at all discouraged because of the failure to secure a\r\nvictim on the first trial.\r\n\r\n“I’m banking on gettin’ the critter tonight, though,” he announced,\r\nand they knew that he must have some good reason for his belief.\r\n\r\nSure enough, in the morning, when they once more paid a visit to the\r\nfur farm, with Tubby, Sim and Andy tagging along, Pete took them out\r\nto where the trap had been set. He did not say anything, but Rob\r\ncould see from the look on his face that he had a surprise in store\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nThe big cat had been caught, and Pete, coming along at peep of day,\r\nhad killed it with a single shot, not wishing the wretched thing to\r\nsuffer any more than was necessary. If anything, it was larger than\r\nits mate.\r\n\r\nRalph was feeling quite contented as they came back again to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n“Now there’s only one more thing on my mind,” he remarked to Rob,\r\nand the latter did not have to ask him what that was, for he knew.\r\n\r\nHe imagined that the invitation to visit Wyoming would be\r\nforthcoming around the lunch hour, for undoubtedly Ralph was growing\r\ntired of waiting for Peleg to show up, and meant to put the whole\r\nthing to a deciding test in the office of that curio dealer.\r\n\r\nIf such were Ralph’s plans, they were fated never to be carried out.\r\nRob was swinging idly on the porch seat, all by himself, the other\r\nthree being back in the milk room watching the process of\r\ncheese-making under the supervision of Mr. Jeffords, when he saw\r\nRalph come hastily toward him. Rob had reason to believe that the\r\nother must have been in his den at the barn, since he came from that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw the strange look on the other’s face, Rob stopped\r\nswinging and awaited his arrival. No sooner had he come up than he\r\ntossed something in Rob’s lap.\r\n\r\n“I want somebody to kick me,” said Ralph bitterly, “for I sure\r\ndeserve it. Those packets are the missing stamps, and where do you\r\nthink I found them but behind my trunk, where they must have been\r\nblown by a passing gust of wind!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Chapter XXV\r\n\r\n                            Lucky Peleg\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough thrilled by the announcement, the scout leader’s first\r\nsensation was rather one of great joy. He seemed to see the pale\r\nearnest face of poor Peleg Pinder rise up again before him; and how\r\nglad he felt that through it all, even when the clouds seemed\r\ndarkest for Peleg, he had continued to firmly believe in the other’s\r\ninnocence.\r\n\r\nRalph was showing signs of remorse. He realized now that what Rob\r\nhad said to him about not depending on circumstantial evidence, when\r\ncharging a companion with an evil deed, was true, since at best it\r\nmust be an unreliable staff upon which to lean.\r\n\r\nStill, there was one delightful thing about it, besides the\r\ndiscovery of Peleg’s innocence; and this was the frank way in which\r\nRalph took himself to task. Such action spoke well for his bigness\r\nof heart. Rob felt sure that the young fur farmer would never again\r\nallow himself to believe wrong of a comrade without more tangible\r\nevidence than mere suspicion.\r\n\r\n“So these are the stamps that kicked up such a tempest in a teapot,\r\nare they?” remarked Rob, shuffling the various packets between his\r\nhands. “The old curio dealer didn’t see them, after all. That’s\r\ngoing to save you a visit to town, I reckon, Ralph. The chances were\r\nyou had figured on putting your threat into execution.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the other, contritely, “I might as well own that I\r\nhad made my mind up to run in this very day and learn the truth. I\r\ncouldn’t stand it any longer, you see, thinking all those mean\r\nthings about Peleg. Right now I’m wondering how I’ll ever look him\r\nstraight in the eye again.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! don’t let that worry you, Ralph. There’s no need of his ever\r\nknowing that he was under suspicion. Where ignorance is bliss, you\r\nknow, they say it’s folly to be wise. Let things go as they were\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\nRalph shook his head dubiously.\r\n\r\n“I’m inclined to believe there’s going to be a change of some sort\r\nin our relations,” he hastened to say, “because of this queer\r\nabsence on the part of Peleg. He isn’t the fellow to shirk work, and\r\nyou know we saw him the other day over at the farmhouse where his\r\nsister works out. Then there was that talk about him receiving a\r\nmysterious letter; besides, we all noticed that he looked excited\r\nwhen we saw him in town; yes, and he even went into the Harris\r\nArcade, where several lawyers have their offices, though I never\r\nknew they stayed there after nightfall. But perhaps Peleg had an\r\nappointment with one of them.”\r\n\r\nBy this time he had Rob deeply interested.\r\n\r\n“It begins to look as if there might be another mystery connected\r\nwith Peleg’s fortunes,” he observed, laughingly. “This time we can\r\nwait for the developments without being worried. I suppose in good\r\ntime you’ll see the boy again, or at least have word from him?”\r\n\r\n“That goes without saying,” Ralph agreed. “I’ve always found him\r\nhonest and straightforward. Something he didn’t calculate on is\r\nholding him back; but he will show up in good time, believe me.”\r\n\r\nIt was strange how much brighter the day seemed to Rob after\r\ndiscovering that Peleg was indeed innocent of peculation, and had\r\ndone nothing that was wrong. Why, the very birds appeared to sing\r\nwith sweeter notes than before, while the sunshine filled the boy\r\nwith a joy he had not fully known since Ralph first communicated his\r\ndoleful suspicions. That is always the way with a scout who has\r\nlearned the greatest lesson on the books of the organization--to care\r\nfor his fellows even as he does for himself, because that is the\r\ngreatest of all commandments. Somehow nobody seemed very ambitious\r\nto be doing strenuous things on that particular day. It was pretty\r\nhot, for the mountains, and the shade under the long porch appeared\r\nto strike them as just right. So they lolled there in easy-chairs,\r\nhammocks, and the broad swing as the minutes went past, chatting,\r\ntelling stories of past experiences, and in this way exchanging\r\nviews after the manner of boys in general.\r\n\r\nRalph wanted to know many things connected with the adventures which\r\nhad fallen to the scout leader and some of his chums, not only\r\naround their home town down on Long Island, but under other\r\nskies--away across the water where the great nations of Europe were\r\nfighting the most terrible war of all history; upon the desert sands\r\nof northern Mexico; and even amidst the glories of the wonderful\r\nPanama-Pacific Exposition out in California.\r\n\r\nThis giving out of information was not wholly one-sided, either.\r\nRalph had been around considerable, and was able to talk of strange\r\nthings he had run across down in the Land of Dixie, where he had\r\nlived the better part of his young life, exploring the swamps where\r\nthe weird Spanish moss festooned the trees, and gave such a funereal\r\naspect to the picture; and Ralph could relate numerous amusing\r\nstories of the former slaves whom he had known.\r\n\r\nSo the morning passed away. The big bullfrogs over in the pond piped\r\nin chorus, undisturbed by any pot-hunter with deadly Flobert;\r\ndoubtless, those bass still left in the pretty lake back of the\r\nhills rejoiced to know they would not be tempted to take an\r\nattractive lure that was apt to have a sharp barb concealed within\r\nits midst. For the five boys spent the entire morning in sweet\r\nidleness, content to let the hours drift past without exerting\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nTubby, Andy and Sim had heard enough to know that there was\r\nsomething queer connected with Peleg’s actions. Ralph concluded to\r\ntake them into his confidence with regard to the serious mistake he\r\nhad come so near making. Consequently the packets of stamps were\r\nexhibited, and the sad story told of how a frivolous gust of wind\r\nhad almost caused Ralph to accuse the farm boy of being a thief.\r\n\r\nThey promised never to breathe a word of the story. Secretly they\r\nthought all the more of Ralph for his genuine self-condemnation. No\r\ndoubt, it would be a good lesson to all of them; which was really\r\none reason why Ralph, at Rob’s suggestion, had mentioned the facts;\r\nfor they could see how easy it must always be to think evil of one’s\r\nbest friend when circumstances arise that seem convincing, although\r\nan explanation, if sought, may brush them away as though they were\r\nmere cobwebs.\r\n\r\nDuring that morning there must have been dozens of times when one or\r\nanother of the boys walked to the end of the porch as if to stretch\r\ntheir legs, when in reality it was to look along the road in the\r\ndirection that a traveler must take if coming from that farmhouse\r\nwhere they had seen Peleg driving up in what appeared to be a hired\r\nbuggy.\r\n\r\n“Here he comes!” suddenly called out Tubby all of a sudden, as he\r\nstood at that particular end of the porch.\r\n\r\nNo one demanded to know who was meant, because the same thought was\r\nin every fellow’s brain. They scrambled to their feet from hammock,\r\nswing, and easychairs to twist their heads around, and stare in the\r\nquarter in which Tubby was looking.\r\n\r\nYes, a vehicle could be seen approaching, with the dust rising\r\nbehind the lazy shuffling motion of the horse’s hoofs. Apparently,\r\nwhoever drove was in no particular hurry to get on.\r\n\r\n“Why, there seem to be two persons in the buggy!” ejaculated\r\nkeen-eyed Sim.\r\n\r\n“But one’s Peleg, all right,” added Tubby, stubbornly, not wishing\r\nto be shorn of his right as first discoverer.\r\n\r\n“Just who it is,” Ralph assured them, and he ought to know. “The\r\nother person seems to be a girl, and it wouldn’t surprise me now if\r\nshe turned out to be Hetty Pinder.”\r\n\r\n“You mean Peleg’s sister, the one who was working in service on that\r\nother farm?” asked Andy, more than a little excited as he seemed to\r\nscent something interesting in the coming back of Peleg under such\r\nodd conditions.\r\n\r\nMr. Jeffords came out on the porch. Possibly he had noticed the\r\ncoming of Peleg up the lane that led from the main road; and felt a\r\nmild curiosity to know why he had remained away so long; also what\r\npossessed him to fetch his sister over from the farm where she had\r\nengaged to work.\r\n\r\nRob knew something good was going to come about. He gauged the broad\r\ngrin on Peleg’s face to mean that he had news for them. The girl was\r\nsmiling happily, it seemed. Yes, Fortune must have finally consented\r\nto beam upon the Pinder family, so long down and out.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning, Mr. Jeffords! Good-morning, Ralph, and all the rest\r\no’ you,” said Peleg as he came up the steps, holding his sister by\r\nthe arm. “I just dropped over to let you know I ain’t agoin’ to work\r\nno more with you. Sorry to say it, too, sure I am, ’cause you’ve\r\nbeen mighty kind to me, and I never ain’t meanin’ to forget it,\r\nneither. I got a farm o’ my own now, you see, Mr. Jeffords; and\r\nwe’re meanin’ to have them other three Pinders come out o’ the\r\n’sylum and live to home.”\r\n\r\n“Well, this is great news, Peleg,” said Mr. Jeffords, holding out\r\nboth hands to the boy, and his shy sister, who looked so rosy and\r\nhappy now. “Tell us all about it, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Just what I was meanin’ to do, sir,” said the accommodating Peleg,\r\nhis eyes fairly dancing with excitement and joy. “You see, it came\r\nto me ’bout like one o’ them bombshells I heard Rob here tellin’\r\nhe’d seen explode over in Europe. That letter I got some days back\r\nwas from Mr. Green, the lawyer man down in Wyoming. It told me to\r\ncome and see him that evening, ’cause he had some right good news to\r\ntell me. So I goes in, and he shows me a letter he had from another\r\nlawyer away out in Colorado. This says that my uncle, Peleg Pipps,\r\nhad just died there, and in his will he leaves what he’d scraped\r\ntogether to me as his--er, namesake the lawyer calls it.”\r\n\r\nPeleg looked proudly around as he said this, just as though he felt\r\nit a triumph, after all, to carry the name he did; though possibly\r\non more than one occasion he had ardently wished it might have been\r\nplain Bill or Tom.\r\n\r\n“This is splendid news you’re telling us, Peleg,” said Mr. Jeffords,\r\nstill shaking hands with his former help. “What about the farm--is it\r\none your uncle owned out there in Colorado?”\r\n\r\n“Shucks! no, sir, it’s the Widow Hawkins’ place, you see, just\r\ntwenty acres of fine ground that her husband made his pile out o’\r\nbefore he died. I used to work there once, and always liked the\r\nhouse, it seemed so much like a home. Mr. Green, he fixed it so that\r\nhalf the money that comes to me is agoin’ to pay cash for the\r\nHawkins farm; and the widow, she’s sent word we c’n get in right\r\naway. You see, she sold me the furniture and everythin’ as it\r\nstands. And, oh! Mr. Jeffords, just to think I got a home now, after\r\nall, where we c’n all live as long as we want; and there ain’t ever\r\nagoin’ to be no poorhouse in our dreams, either.”\r\n\r\nTubby, and perhaps some of the other boys as well, might have been\r\nobserved to wink violently about that time, as though their vision\r\nhad become more or less obscured. Rob was more rejoiced than he\r\ncould have told, for it all seemed to be coming out like a fairy\r\nstory, with this almost forgotten old uncle away out in Colorado\r\ndying just at a time when the little Pinders, scattered and\r\nhomesick, were so much in need of succor.\r\n\r\nThey insisted on shaking hands with Peleg, each one in turn, and\r\ncongratulating him most heartily on his great good fortune. Then\r\nthey were also introduced to Hetty, his sister, a rather buxom girl\r\nof about fourteen, and large for her age, who gave promise of being\r\nwell able to act the part of homekeeper when once Peleg had gathered\r\nhis little brood under the roof of the Hawkins’ farmhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Chapter XXVI\r\n\r\n                          Headed for Home\r\n\r\n\r\nPeleg and his sister were warmly invited to remain and take lunch\r\nwith his former employer, which they consented to do. They meant to\r\ncontinue on afterwards to the Hawkins place, and start housekeeping\r\nimmediately. Mr. Green had supplied the boy with sufficient funds\r\nfor the time being, and promised to turn over the balance as soon as\r\nthe estate of Uncle Peleg had been fully settled up, which would be\r\nin the course of a few weeks.\r\n\r\n“What sort of a farm is this that Peleg has come into?” Rob asked\r\nRalph, and the other three fellows bent their heads to hear, being\r\ndeeply interested.\r\n\r\n“It is one of the best around this whole section,” explained Ralph,\r\nwarmly. “Peleg shows great good sense in choosing to get hold of it\r\nat a bargain, for the widow has been wanting to leave this country\r\nsince she lost her husband, going to relatives out in Cleveland,\r\nOhio. The house is roomy, and has some modern conveniences. The\r\nground produces fair crops; there is considerable fruit, and a fine\r\nkitchen garden, always the pride of Mrs. Hawkins’ heart. Besides,\r\nthere are big barns, quite some stock, and poultry, as well as bees\r\nand such things. Oh! Peleg is the happiest boy in the whole State of\r\nNew York just now, I can tell you.”\r\n\r\n“The best of it is,” added Rob, soberly, “he deserves everything\r\nthat has come to him. You told me how his one longing was to be able\r\nto earn a home, no matter how humble, where he could gather his\r\nbrothers and sisters together under one roof. I never was so glad of\r\nanything in my whole life as to know that luck has at last smiled on\r\nthe Pinders.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” remarked Tubby, wisely, “it’s a long lane that has no turn.\r\nAll you’re got to do is to wait, and have patience, and dig away\r\nwith might and main, leaving the rest.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a long head of yours, Tubby,” laughed Ralph. “It’s a pity\r\nfellows don’t always practice what they preach. But I know how all\r\nof you feel about Peleg, and I want to say right here that it does\r\nyou credit.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, Peleg looked very proud and contented as he and his sister\r\nsat there at the table with the rest, and answered the many\r\nquestions that were asked concerning their plans for the future.\r\n\r\nLater on they drove away again, after the horse had been “baited” at\r\nthe barn; and all sorts of good wishes were wafted after them. Ralph\r\nlooked at Rob and nodded his head.\r\n\r\n“It all came out splendidly, didn’t it?” he went on to say. “I’m\r\nmighty glad now I didn’t give way to that feeling when I came near\r\naccusing the poor boy. He would never have gotten over it. I’ve\r\nalways thought so much of Peleg, too. Now I can run over and see how\r\nthey’re getting along whenever I feel like it. From what I know of\r\nhis ways, I’m certain he’ll make that old Hawkins’ farm pay well.”\r\n\r\nThey were still sitting there on the porch about the middle of the\r\nafternoon, feeling that they might as well finish that day by doing\r\nnext to nothing, when a cloud of dust down the road caught their\r\nattention. Soon afterwards they made out several cars heading their\r\nway. To the surprise of the boys these turned in at the lane leading\r\nup to the Jeffords’ farmhouse.\r\n\r\n“Why, it is the mayor of Wyoming, as sure as you live!” exclaimed\r\nTubby, beginning to look “flustered.”\r\n\r\n“And those other people are some of the leading citizens of the\r\ntown,” added Ralph, with a chuckle, as though he half suspected what\r\nit all meant. “Yes, I can see several gentlemen who are owners of\r\nthose mills and factories. I wouldn’t be much surprised now if they\r\nthought they hadn’t thanked us enough for doing that little job, and\r\nhave come out to repeat.”\r\n\r\nRob jumped up, but Sim and Andy caught hold of him.\r\n\r\n“No, you don’t skip out of here,” they told him in concert. “If\r\nthere’s going to be any sort of bouquet throwing, you’ve got to stay\r\naround and take your share of it. A scout never runs away from the\r\nfiring line, you ought to know, Rob. So just grin and bear it.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Rob had to remain, though he looked uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThere were fully a dozen gentlemen in the party accompanying the fat\r\nmayor of the town, and all of them seemed to be in a most agreeable\r\nhumor, judging from the smiles that wreathed their faces.\r\n\r\nMr. Jeffords greeted each one in turn, shaking hands. No doubt, he\r\nwas able to give a pretty good guess as to what had caused this\r\nexodus from Wyoming on such a warm afternoon; and it could be put\r\ndown as certain that this was not intended to be merely a social\r\ncall. Those men meant business as well as sentiment.\r\n\r\nWhen they lined up, and the mayor turned toward Rob and the rest of\r\nthe boys, it was plainly apparent that he had a little speech ready.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a few words to say to you, Ralph, Rob, and the rest,” he\r\ncommenced, “after which I have a very pleasant mission to carry out.\r\nWe have been holding a meeting since the great fire that threatened\r\nto wipe out our town, and when all of Wyoming’s influential citizens\r\nlearned what a narrow escape our beloved homes and business blocks\r\nhad from destruction, they decided that they had not been able to\r\nexpress the feelings they experienced toward you boys who so nobly\r\nfought to hold the fire fiend in check. So we have come up here\r\ntoday, sent by the women of Wyoming, to tell you again how much they\r\nappreciate those efforts in our behalf.\r\n\r\n“We know that it is against the rules of your organization, Mr.\r\nScout Master, to accept payment for services freely rendered to\r\nothers in times of trouble; but the grateful hearts of our women\r\nhope that each of you will not disdain to wear these modest little\r\nbadges which they have had made by our town jeweler, and which are\r\nemblematic of the feeling they entertain for you.\r\n\r\n“With your consent I shall take great pleasure in pinning these upon\r\nthe lapels of your khaki coats where I see you already wear the\r\nhonored insignia of your order. And I am instructed to say to you,\r\none and all, that we citizens of Wyoming look upon each of these\r\nlittle medals as a true badge of courage, for it symbolizes the\r\nbravery and ready wit not only to conceive that grand scheme of\r\nblowing up a building to stay the spread of the fire, but to\r\nactually carry it into execution. Rob, will you oblige me by\r\nstepping up, first of all, and letting me do you this honor.”\r\n\r\nSo Rob had to obey, though painfully embarrassed, if his flushed\r\nface stood for anything. Ralph, too, was not forgotten, even though\r\nas yet he did not wear the khaki of the scout service; but events\r\nwere moving rapidly now, and it would not be long before Wyoming\r\nwould take her place in the ranks of those towns able to boast of a\r\ngrowing organization founded on the principle of “doing a good turn\r\nevery day.”\r\n\r\nAfterwards, those boys had reason to feel very proud of the\r\nbeautiful little gold medals that had been presented to them; and\r\nwhich they later on received permission to wear from Scout\r\nHeadquarters, after the story of their labors in fighting the flames\r\nwhen Wyoming was threatened with destruction had been sent on by the\r\ninterested people of that grateful community.\r\n\r\nThe rest of their stay up in the mountainous country of the\r\nAdirondacks was replete with lively happenings, but there is no time\r\nto relate their further adventures just now. They enjoyed every\r\nminute of the time, and more than one noble string of fish was\r\ncarried home from that teeming lake as a reward for merit and\r\nperseverance. Tubby, too, took toll from the pond where those\r\nmonster “greenbacks” sang their nightly chorus. Before the boys\r\nfinally left for home it was noticable what a difference there was\r\nin the volume of sound emanating from that pond on a still night.\r\n\r\nAt the time they said good-bye regretfully to Ralph, whom they had\r\ncome to care for immensely, as though he were a brother to them all,\r\nthe fur farm was progressing favorably. No more wildcats or other\r\n“vermin” had put in an appearance; and the proud proprietor\r\nannounced on the last day of their stay that he had reason to\r\nbelieve his minks now had a family of their own, which would be a\r\ntremendous feather in his cap as a grower of fine furs.\r\n\r\nThey had had one opportunity to run over and visit Peleg in his new\r\nhome, and everybody seemed delighted with what he showed them. There\r\ncould not be any doubt about Peleg and his sister being as happy as\r\nthe day was long; and Rob felt sure they would make a fair success\r\nof farming, and keeping house, judging from what he saw while there.\r\n\r\nThe other little Pinders had not arrived as yet, because it would be\r\na matter of some time before they could be formally released from\r\nthe public institution to which they had been committed at the death\r\nof their father; but Peleg said he expected they would be home in\r\nabout another week or so. How proudly he showed them the rooms\r\nfitted up for the youngsters, as well as the little chickens that\r\nwere to be their especial pets.\r\n\r\nSo, in due time, Rob, Sim, Tubby and Andy once more turned their\r\nfaces homeward. They felt that they had had a glorious vacation, as\r\nthey sat in the train headed south; and every time any of them\r\nchanced to glance down at the “badge of courage” fastened to their\r\ncoat lapels, doubtless their thoughts again carried them back to\r\nthat fearful night when only for the inspiration that came to Rob\r\nBlake the whole town of Wyoming would have gone up in smoke and\r\nashes.\r\n\r\n                              THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n              HURST & COMPANY’S BOOKS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE\r\n\r\n           A Volume of Cheerfulness in Rhyme and Picture\r\n\r\n                       KINDERGARTEN LIMERICKS\r\n\r\n                        By FLORENCE E.
