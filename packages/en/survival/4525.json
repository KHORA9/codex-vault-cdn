But to restore depleted soils to high productive power\r\nin economic systems is no fool's job, for it requires mental as well\r\nas muscular energy; and no apologies should be expected from those\r\nwho necessarily make use of technical terms in the discussion of\r\nthis technical subject, notwithstanding the common foolish advice\r\nthat farmers should be given a sort of \"parrot\" instruction in\r\nalmost baby language instead of established facts and principles in\r\ndefinite and permanent scientific terms. The farmer should be as\r\nfamiliar with the names of the ten essential elements of plant food\r\nas he is with the names of his ten nearest neighbors. Safe and\r\npermanent systems of soil improvement and preservation may come with\r\nintelligence--never with ignorance--on the part of the landowners.\r\n\r\nWhen the knowledge becomes general that food for plants is just as\r\nnecessary as food for animals, then American agriculture will mean\r\nmore than merely working the land for all that's in it. This\r\nknowledge is as well established as the fact that the earth is\r\nround, although the people are relatively few who understand or make\r\nintelligent application of the existing information.\r\n\r\nAgricultural plants consist of ten elements, known as the essential\r\nelements of plant food; and not a kernel of corn or a grain of\r\nwheat, not a leaf of clover or a spear of grass can be produced if\r\nthe plant fails to secure any one of these ten elements. Some of\r\nthese are supplied to plants in abundance by natural processes;\r\nothers are not so provided and must be supplied by the farmer, or\r\nhis land becomes impoverished and unproductive.\r\n\r\n\r\nFoods That Plants Live On\r\n\r\nTwo elements, carbon and oxygen, are contained in normal air in the\r\nform of a gas called carbon dioxid, and this compound is taken into\r\nthe plant through the breathing pores, which are microscopic\r\nopenings located chiefly on the under side of the leaves. Some\r\nplants have more than a hundred thousand breathing pores to the\r\nsquare inch of leaf surface.\r\n\r\nWhen plants or plant products are burned or decomposed the carbon of\r\nthe combustible material--grass, wood, coal, and so forth--unites\r\nwith the free oxygen of the atmosphere to re-form the carbon dioxid,\r\nwhich thus returns as a gas to the air. Even the food taken into the\r\nanimal system, after being digested and carried into the blood, is\r\nbrought, into contact with the oxygen of the air--which also passes\r\ninto the blood through the cell walls of the lungs--and a form of\r\ncombustion takes place, the heat generated serving to warm the body\r\nwhile the carbon dioxid passes back into the lungs and is exhaled\r\ninto the open air.\r\n\r\nBy these circulation processes the supply of carbon dioxid in the\r\natmosphere is renewed and maintained without any special effort on\r\nthe part of man. Hydrogen is one of the elements of which water is\r\ncomposed. Water is taken into the plant through the roots, carried\r\nthrough the stems to the leaves, and there, under the influence of\r\nchlorophyll, sunlight and the life principle, the carbon, oxygen and\r\nhydrogen are made to unite into some of the most important plant\r\ncompounds, such as the sugars, which are later transformed into\r\nstarch and fiber.\r\n\r\nThough these three elements constitute the larger part of the mature\r\nagricultural plant they are no more necessary for plant growth than\r\nthe seven which are supplied by the soil. Iron is one of the\r\nessential elements of plant food; but the amount required by plants\r\nis so small and the amount contained in the soil is so large that\r\nsoils have never been known to become deficient in iron. Though\r\nsulfur is found in plants in very appreciable amounts and is known\r\nto be essential to plant growth, it is evident that plants do not\r\nneed so much sulfur as they often contain, some of it being taken up\r\nand merely tolerated, as is the case with all of the sodium and\r\nsilicon found in plants, neither of these being required for normal\r\ngrowth, although commonly found in plants in very considerable\r\namounts. The supply of sulfur in normal soils is not large; but,\r\nwith the combustion and decay of organic materials--coal, wood,\r\ngrass, leaves, and so forth--sulfur passes into the air and is\r\nbrought back to the soil dissolved in rain or absorbed by direct\r\ncontact of soil and air. Thus under normal conditions the supply of\r\nsulfur naturally provided is ample to meet the needs of the staple\r\nfarm crops, although there are some plants, such as cabbage, for\r\nexample, which may possibly be benefited by fertilizing with sulfur.\r\n\r\nBut there are five other essential elements of plant food, and these\r\nrequire special consideration in connection with permanent soil\r\nfertility. They are potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus and\r\nnitrogen. There are also five important points to be kept in mind in\r\nrelation to each of these elements: (1) the soil's supply, (2) the\r\ncrop requirements, (3) the loss by leaching, (4) the methods of\r\nliberation, and (5) the means of renewal.\r\n\r\nThe neglect of one or more of these important points in relation to\r\none or more of these five elements has reduced the fertility of most\r\ncultivated soils in the United States, has greatly impoverished the\r\nolder farm lands, and has brought agricultural abandonment to\r\nmillions of acres in the original thirteen states. On the other\r\nhand, intelligent attention to these same factors will bring\r\nrestoration and high productive power to such lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland's Best Lesson in Farming\r\n\r\nWhere these five elements were supplied regularly to land on the\r\nRothamsted Experiment Station the average yield of wheat for the\r\nthirty years, 1852 to 1881, was 35.9 bushels an acre, while 13.6 was\r\nthe average yield of similar unfertilized land; and during the next\r\nthirty years--1882 to 1911--the corresponding average yields were 38\r\nbushels an acre on the fertilized land, and 11.7 bushels where no\r\nplant food was applied. These statements are not mere opinions, but\r\ndetermined facts whose accuracy stands unquestioned.\r\n\r\nOn another field at Rothamsted, England, the average yield of barley\r\nfor the same sixty years was 43 bushels an acre where nitrogen,\r\nphosphorus and calcium were regularly applied, 42.6 where all five\r\nelements--including potassium and magnesium--were added, but only\r\n14.3 on unfertilized land.\r\n\r\nOn still another Rothamsted experiment field, where a four-year crop\r\nrotation of turnips, barley, clover (or beans) and wheat has been\r\npracticed since 1848, the yield of turnips in 1908 was 717 pounds an\r\nacre on unfertilized land and 35,168 pounds where the five important\r\nelements of plant food had been regularly applied once every four\r\nyears--for the turnips only--since 1848. In 1909 the barley yielded\r\n33.4 bushels an acre on the fertilized land, but only 10 bushels\r\nwhere no plant food was applied. The yield of clover in 1910 was\r\n8590 pounds an acre on the land fertilized for turnips, but only\r\n1949 on the unfertilized land. The wheat following the clover with\r\nno other fertilizer produced 24.5 bushels an acre in 1911, but 38\r\nbushels where plant food is always applied for turnips grown three\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\nThese are the established facts from the longest accurate record,\r\nand thus the most trustworthy data the world affords; and when one\r\nhears promulgated the very pleasing doctrine that the rotation of\r\ncrops will maintain the fertility of the soil it is time to remember\r\nthat \"to err is human.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFertility in Normal Soils\r\n\r\nOf the four important mineral elements, potassium is by far the most\r\nabundant in common soils. Thus, as an average of ten residual soils\r\nfrom ten different geological formations in the eastern part of\r\nUnited States, two million pounds of subsurface soil were found to\r\ncontain:\r\n\r\n     Potassium 37,860 pounds\r\n     Magnesium 14,080 pounds\r\n     Calcium    7,810 pounds\r\n     Phosphorus 1,100 pounds\r\n\r\nEven the depleted, and to some extent abandoned, gently undulating\r\nupland \"Leonardtown loam,\" which was farmed for generations and\r\nwhich, according to the surveys of the Federal Bureau of Soils,\r\ncovers 41 per cent of St. Mary's County, Maryland, and more than\r\n45,000 acres of Prince George's County--still contains in two\r\nmillion pounds of surface soil--corresponding to the plowed soil of\r\nan acre about 6-2/3 inches deep:\r\n\r\n     Potassium 18,500 pounds\r\n     Magnesium  3,480 pounds\r\n     Calcium    1,000 pounds\r\n     Phosphorus   160 pounds\r\n\r\nThe brown silt loam prairie soil of the early Wisconsin glaciation\r\nis the most common type of the greatest soil area in the Illinois\r\nCorn Belt. Two million pounds of this surface soil contain as an\r\naverage:\r\n\r\n     Potassium 36,250 pounds\r\n     Magnesium  8,790 pounds\r\n     Calcium   11,450 pounds\r\n     Phosphorus 1,190 pounds\r\n\r\nThe older gray silt loam prairie, the most extensive soil of\r\nSouthern Illinois, contains in two million pounds of soil:\r\n\r\n     Potassium 24,940 pounds\r\n     Magnesium  4,690 pounds\r\n     Calcium    3,420 pounds\r\n     Phosphorus   840 pounds\r\n\r\nThese data represent averages involving hundreds of soil analyses,\r\nand they emphasize the fact that normal soils are rich in potassium\r\nand poor in phosphorus. This is to be expected, for most soils are\r\nmade from the earth's crust, and normal soils should bear some\r\nrelation in composition to the average of the earth's crust, which\r\ncontains in two million pounds 49,200 pounds of potassium and 2,200\r\npounds of phosphorus, as shown by the weighted averages of analyses\r\ninvolving about two thousand samples of representative rocks,\r\nreported by the United States Geological Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasuring Fertility Losses\r\n\r\nThe plant food required for one acre of wheat yielding 50 bushels,\r\none acre each of corn and oats yielding 100 bushels, and one acre of\r\nclover yielding four tons, includes for the total crops:\r\n\r\n     Potassium 320 pounds\r\n     Magnesium  68 pounds\r\n     Calcium   168 pounds\r\n     Phosphorus 77 pounds\r\n\r\nIf only the grain, including a yield of 4 bushels an acre of clover\r\nseed, is considered, the straw, stalks and hay being returned to the\r\nsoil--either directly or in farm fertilizer--then the loss per acre\r\nfrom four years of cropping as above would be as follows:\r\n\r\n     Potassium  51 pounds\r\n     Magnesium  16 pounds\r\n     Calcium     5 pounds\r\n     Phosphorus 42 pounds\r\n\r\nThe average annual loss by leaching from good soils in humid\r\nsections is known by the results of many analyses to be about as\r\nfollows per acre:\r\n\r\n     Potassium  10 pounds\r\n     Calcium   300 pounds\r\n     Phosphorus  2 pounds\r\n\r\nThe average annual loss of magnesium in drainage water from good\r\nsoils is probably 30 pounds or more an acre, but the data thus far\r\nsecured are inconclusive with respect to that element.\r\n\r\nA careful consideration of the trustworthy data clearly reveals the\r\nfact that potassium is very abundant in normal soils, while\r\nphosphorus is relatively very deficient; and, all things considered,\r\ncalcium--and probably magnesium--is of much greater significance\r\nthan potassium, from the standpoint of the maintenance of usable\r\nplant food in the soil. It should be noted, too, that certain crops\r\nwhich are exceedingly important for economic systems of permanent\r\nagriculture require very large amounts of calcium as plant food.\r\nThus a four-ton crop of clover hay takes about 120 pounds of calcium\r\nfrom the soil, or the same amount as of potassium; while such a crop\r\nof alfalfa requires about 145 pounds of calcium, but only 96 pounds\r\nof potassium. When it is known that the abandoned \"Leonardtown loam\"\r\nstill contains in two million pounds of surface soil 18,500 pounds\r\nof potassium and only 1000 pounds of total calcium, the significance\r\nof these chemical and mathematical data must be apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Liberation of Fertility\r\n\r\nProbably there has never been a greater waste of time and effort in\r\nthe name of science than in the endeavor to determine the\r\n\"available\" plant food in soils. The almost universal assumption has\r\nbeen that the plant food in the soil exists in two distinct\r\nconditions, \"available\" and \"unavailable,\" and that the\r\ndetermination of the \"available\" plant food would reveal both the\r\ncrop-producing power of the soil and the fundamental fertilizer\r\nrequirements for the improvement of the soil for crop production.\r\n\r\nAfter ascertaining the total stock of plant food in the plowed soil,\r\nthe next important question is not how much is \"available,\" but\r\nrather how much can be made available during the crop season, year\r\nafter year. In other words we must make plant food available by\r\npractical methods of liberation, by converting it from insoluble\r\ncompounds into soluble and usable forms; for plant food must be in\r\nsolution before the plant can take it from the soil. For the\r\npresent, space is taken only to emphasize the value of decaying\r\norganic manures in the important matter of making plant food\r\navailable; and attention is also called to the fact that the\r\ndecomposition of the organic matter of the soil--including both\r\nfresh materials and old humus--is hastened by tillage and by\r\nunderdrainage, which permit the oxygen of the air to enter the soil\r\nmore freely, oxygen being a most active agent in nitrification and\r\nother decomposition processes of organic matter, as well as in the\r\nmore common combustion of wood, coal, and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Renewal of Fertility\r\n\r\nIn rational systems of general farming the supply of any element\r\nwhich is normally very abundant may be renewed from the subsoil by\r\neven the very slight erosion which occurs on all ordinary lands in\r\nhumid sections. This statement applies to iron and potassium, and\r\noften to magnesium.\r\n\r\nIf two million pounds of normal surface soil contain 30,000 pounds\r\nof potassium, one inch an acre would contain 4500 pounds of that\r\nelement; and if a third of this--1500 pounds--were removed by\r\ncropping and leaching before its removal by surface washing, then\r\ntwo-thirds of a century could be allowed for the erosion of one inch\r\nof soil, with crop yields of 50 bushels of wheat, 100 bushels of\r\ncorn and oats, and 4 bushels of clover seed to the acre, provided\r\nthe stalks, straw and clover hay were returned to the land, either\r\ndirectly or in farm manure. This amount of surface washing is likely\r\nto occur on land sufficiently undulating for good surface drainage,\r\nprovided the land is plowed and cultivated as frequently as would be\r\nrequired for a four-year rotation as suggested above. Where hay,\r\nstraw, potatoes, root crops or common market garden crops are sold,\r\nvery much larger amounts of potassium leave the farm than in grain\r\nfarming or live-stock farming, and in such cases potassium must\r\nultimately be purchased and returned to the soil, either in\r\ncommercial form or in animal manures from the cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThirty Bushels for Potassium\r\n\r\nThere are some soils, however, which are not normal--soils whose\r\ncomposition bears no sort of relation to the average of the earth's\r\ncrust; such, for example, as peaty swamp soil or bog lands, which\r\nconsist largely of partly decayed moss and swamp grasses. These\r\nsoils are exceedingly poor in potassium, and they are markedly and\r\nvery profitably improved by potassium fertilizers, such as potassium\r\nsulphate and potassium chloride--commonly but erroneously called\r\n\"muriate\" of potash.\r\n\r\nThus, as an average of triplicate tests each year, the addition of\r\npotassium to such land on the University of Illinois experiment\r\nfield near Manito, Mason county, increased the yield by 20.7 bushels\r\nmore corn to the acre in 1902, by 23.5 in 1903, by 29 in 1904 and by\r\n36.8 in 1905; and the proceedings of the midsummer session of the\r\nIllinois State Farmers' Institute for 1911 report that the use of\r\n$22,500 in potassium salts on the peaty swamp lands in the\r\nneighborhood of Tampico, Whiteside county, increased the value of\r\nthe corn crop in 1910 by $210,000, the average increase for\r\npotassium being about 30 bushels of corn to the acre.\r\n\r\nSome sand soils, particularly residual sands, which often consist\r\nlargely of quartz-silicon dioxid--are very deficient in potassium;\r\nconsequently the experiments or demonstrations conducted by the\r\npotash syndicate at Southern Pines, North Carolina, show very marked\r\nincreases from the use of potassium salts on such soil, although the\r\nresult ought not to be used to encourage the use of such fertilizers\r\non normal soils, which are exceedingly rich in potassium.\r\n\r\nEven in soils abundantly supplied with potassium temporary use may\r\nwell be made of soluble potassium salts when no adequate supply of\r\ndecaying organic matter can be provided. For this purpose,\r\nkainit--which contains potassium and also magnesium and sodium in\r\nchlorides and sulfates--is preferred to the more concentrated and\r\nmore expensive potassium salts. About 600 pounds an acre every four\r\nyears is a good application. The kainit will not only furnish\r\nsoluble potassium and magnesium but will also help to dissolve and\r\nthus make available other mineral plant food naturally present or\r\nsupplied, such as natural phosphates. When the supply of organic\r\nmatter produced in crops and returned either in farm manure or in\r\ncrop residues becomes sufficiently abundant, then the addition of\r\nkainit may be discontinued on normal soil.\r\n\r\nThus, as an average of 112 separate tests covering four different\r\nyears, on the Southern Illinois experiment field on worn, thin land,\r\nat Fairfield, the use of 600 pounds an acre of kainit once in four\r\nyears increased the yield of corn by 10.7 bushels where no organic\r\nmanure was used, and by only 1.7 bushels when applied with eight\r\ntons of farm manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiming the Soil\r\n\r\nIn the form of ashes, marl or chalk, lime has been used as a\r\nfertilizer for thousands of years. It serves two very important\r\npurposes: to correct the acidity of sour soils and to supply calcium\r\nand sometimes magnesium as plant food. Burned lime has also been\r\nmuch used, but in more recent years the development of machinery for\r\ncrushing and pulverizing rock--especially in cement manufacture--has\r\nmade possible the production of pulverized natural limestone, and at\r\nmuch less expense than for caustic lime made by burning and slaking.\r\nWhere ground limestone can be easily procured it takes the place of\r\nburned lime, and it produces better results at less expense, even\r\nthough 1-3/4 tons of ground limestone are required to equal 1 ton of\r\nquicklime in calcium content and in power to correct acidity.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, ground limestone can be applied in any amount with no\r\ninjurious results, while caustic lime destroys the organic matter or\r\nhumus of the soil, dissipates soil nitrogen, is disagreeable to\r\nhandle, and may injure the crop unless applied in limited amounts or\r\nseveral months before the crop is to be planted.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable and trustworthy investigation on record in regard\r\nto the comparative value of burned lime and ground limestone has\r\nbeen conducted by the Pennsylvania Experiment Station. A four-year\r\nrotation of crops was practiced, including corn, oats, wheat and hay\r\n(clover and timothy) on four different fields, each crop being\r\nrepresented every year. After twenty years the results for the four\r\nacres showed that the land treated with ground limestone had\r\nproduced 99 bushels more corn, 116 bushels more oats, 13 bushels\r\nmore wheat and 5.6 tons more hay than the land treated with about an\r\nequivalent amount of burned lime. At the end of sixteen years the\r\nanalysis of the soil showed that the burned lime had destroyed 4.7\r\ntons of humus and had dissipated 375 pounds of nitrogen to the acre,\r\nas compared with the ground limestone, this loss being equivalent to\r\n37-1/2 tons of farm manure.\r\n\r\nOther trustworthy experiments by the Maryland and Ohio Experiment\r\nStations confirm the Pennsylvania results in showing better crop\r\nyields when unburned lime carbonate was used; and more extensive\r\nexperiments by the Tennessee Experiment Station also agree with the\r\nPennsylvania data in regard to the destruction of organic matter and\r\nloss of soil nitrogen from the use of burned lime. If dolomitic\r\nlimestone is used, magnesium as well as calcium is thus added to\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nLimestone need not be very finely pulverized. If ground so that it\r\nwill pass through a ten-mesh sieve it is amply fine, assuming that\r\nthe entire product is used, including the finer dust produced in\r\ngrinding, and it is very possible that final investigations will\r\nshow that the entire product from a quarter-inch screen is even more\r\neconomical and profitable in permanent systems.\r\n\r\nLimestone is quite easily soluble in soil water carrying carbonic\r\nacid. It is thus readily available; in fact, it is too available to\r\nbe durable if very finely ground; and in humid sections the loss by\r\nleaching far exceeds that removed by cropping. In practical economic\r\nsystems of farming about two tons an acre of ground limestone should\r\nbe applied every four years, or corresponding amounts for other\r\nrotation periods.\r\n\r\nThe essential facts relating to potassium, magnesium and calcium and\r\nto the use and value of different forms of lime have been stated\r\nabove, and they may be accepted with confidence for use in economic\r\nsystems of farming on normal soils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE NITROGEN PROBLEM AND ITS ECONOMICAL SOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE previous chapter emphasis has been laid upon the fact that\r\nplants as well as animals must have food, and that the neglect or\r\nignorance of this factor in American agriculture has led to soil\r\ndepletion and land ruin on vast areas, especially in the older\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that of the ten essential elements of plant food,\r\nfive are provided by natural processes without the intervention of\r\nman; that, of the remaining five, potassium is the most abundant in\r\nnormal soil, but requires liberation by good systems of farming;\r\nthat ground natural limestone is the ideal material with which to\r\nsupply calcium and to prevent or correct soil acidity; and that if\r\ndolomitic limestone be used magnesium is also supplied in suitable\r\nform for plant food, Thus only nitrogen and phosphorus remain for\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind that systems of permanent profitable agriculture in\r\nAmerica must be founded upon an intelligent understanding of the\r\nfoundation principles involved, let us pray for strength to\r\nacknowledge the truth and cease trying to deceive ourselves. The\r\ntruth is that by soil enrichment alone the average crop yields of\r\nthe United States could be doubled, with the same seed and seasons\r\nand with but little more work than is now devoted to the fields; and\r\nwe should cease trying to deceive ourselves in the hope or belief\r\nthat the fertility of our soil will be maintained if we continue\r\nyear after year to take crops from the land and fail to make\r\nadequate return.\r\n\r\nNitrogen is both the most abundant agriculturally and the most\r\nexpensive commercially of all the elements of plant food; and yet\r\nthere is a method by which it can be secured not only without money\r\nbut with profit in the process. The percentage of nitrogen in normal\r\nsoils decreases with depth, so that subsoils are almost devoid of\r\nnitrogen. This would be more generally understood if it were known\r\nthat the supply of soil nitrogen in humid countries is contained\r\nonly in the organic matter.\r\n\r\nThis organic or vegetable matter consists of the partly decomposed\r\nresidues of plants, including the roots and fallen leaves which may\r\naccumulate naturally, and the green manure crops, crop residues and\r\nfarm manure which may be supplied in farm practice. Thus the\r\nnitrogen of a soil is measured approximately by its content of\r\norganic matter; and, vice versa, the percentage of nitrogen is an\r\napproximate measure of the organic matter, because nitrogen is a\r\nregular constituent of the organic matter normally contained in\r\nsoils. Consequently if the organic matter of a soil is reduced the\r\nsupply of nitrogen is also reduced.\r\n\r\nIn the most depleted soils nitrogen is usually the most deficient\r\nelement, although it may not be the only deficiency. Thus in the\r\ndepleted \"Leonardtown loam,\" which occupies such extensive areas of\r\nland in Southern Maryland, near the District of Columbia, and which\r\nhas been to a large extent agriculturally abandoned after one or two\r\ncenturies of farming, only 900 pounds of nitrogen are found in the\r\nplowed soil of an acre--that is, in 2,000,000 pounds of surface\r\nsoil, corresponding to about 6-2/3 inches an acre. This total amount\r\nif made available would be sufficient for only six such crops of\r\ncorn as are actually produced on our best land in good seasons, and\r\nyet it is four times as much as is contained in an equal weight of\r\nthe subsoil.\r\n\r\nThe average prairie land of the Corn Belt contains only 5000 pounds\r\nof nitrogen in the plowed soil of an acre 6-2/3 inches deep, whereas\r\na 100-bushel crop of corn removes 150 pounds of nitrogen from the\r\nsoil. A simple computation shows the supply in the plowed soil to be\r\nsufficient for only 33 such crops. Even the 100-bushel crop of corn\r\nper acre is known to have been produced in many places on\r\nexceptionally rich land, and yet the ten-year average yield in the\r\nUnited States is only 25 bushels to the acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n200 Per Cent for Nitrogen\r\n\r\nOn Broadbalk Field at Rothamsted, England, wheat has been grown on\r\nthe same land every year for about two-thirds of a century. As an\r\naverage of the sixty years, 1852 to 1911 the yield was 12.6 bushels\r\nan acre on unfertilized land, 14.6 where mineral plant food was\r\nannually applied, 20.3 where nitrogen salts alone were used, and 37\r\nwhere both nitrogen and mineral plant food were applied.\r\n\r\nDuring the thirty years, 1882 to 1911 the average yields were 11.7\r\nbushels an acre on the unfertilized land, 14 with minerals, 18.7\r\nwhere only nitrogen salts were used, and 38 where both nitrogen and\r\nminerals were regularly supplied.\r\n\r\nThese absolute data from the oldest agricultural experiment station\r\nin the world should help us to understand why the ten-year average\r\nyield of wheat is 33 bushels an acre for all of Great Britain,\r\n37-1/2 for England alone, and only 14 for the United States.\r\n\r\nThe application of nitrogen increased the yield of wheat by 24\r\nbushels an acre--from 14 to 38 bushels--as an average of the last\r\nthirty years, following an average increase of 26.3 for the nitrogen\r\napplied during the previous thirty years. It is true that the cost\r\nof the fertilizers used exceeded the value of the increase in yield;\r\nbut let us bear in mind that this truth does not destroy the other\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nProve all things, and hold fast that which is good. It is a good\r\nfact that 1218 bushels of wheat were produced by the application of\r\nnitrogen to an acre of land during a period of sixty years, over and\r\nabove the produce of another acre which differed only by not\r\nreceiving nitrogen; whereas the total produce from an acre of\r\nunfertilized land was only 756 bushels during the same sixty years.\r\nIt is a good fact that the increase alone from the nitrogen applied\r\nis more than twice the total yield of the unfertilized land during\r\nthe last thirty years, and he does well who holds fast this fact.\r\n\r\nIt is also a good fact that as an average of sixty years the yield\r\nof barley was increased by 21.6 bushels an acre by nitrogen; that\r\nnitrogen increased the yield of hay on permanent meadow land at\r\nRothamsted by 1-1/2 tons an acre as a fifty-year average; and that\r\nnitrogen increased the average yield of potatoes by 88 bushels as an\r\naverage of twenty-six years; while the average of the unfertilized\r\nland was only 51 bushels an acre, these increases in barley, bay,\r\nand potatoes being obtained over and above the yields where minerals\r\nalone were used.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Is Nitrogen?\r\n\r\nIf nitrogen has such enormous power to increase the yield of our\r\ngreat staple farm crops then we may well inquire, Where is nitrogen,\r\nand how can it be secured economically and utilized profitably in\r\npractical agriculture?\r\n\r\nThe weight of the atmosphere is 15 pounds to the square inch. This\r\nmeans that a column of air 1 inch square taken to the full height of\r\nthe terrestrial atmosphere weighs 15 pounds. More than three fourths\r\nof the air is nitrogen. Since there are 43,560 square feet in one\r\nacre, it follows that the nitrogen in the air above each acre of the\r\nearth's surface amounts to 70,000,000 pounds, or nearly 500,000\r\ntimes the 150 pounds of nitrogen required for a hundred-bushel crop\r\nof corn. The leaves of the corn plant are blown about by the wind\r\ncarrying 75-1/2 per cent of nitrogen, but cannot utilize an ounce of\r\nthis supply.\r\n\r\nMany people know that clover and other legumes have power, through\r\nthe bacteria which inhabit their root tubercles, to feed upon the\r\ninexhaustible supply of atmospheric nitrogen which freely enters the\r\npores of the soil; but who knows how much nitrogen is taken from the\r\nair by a given crop of clover? Not one in a thousand can answer this\r\nquestion; and meanwhile our continued agricultural and national\r\nprosperity depends in large part upon the possibility of wide\r\ndissemination and practical application of a quantitative knowledge\r\nof the nitrogen problem.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the so-called \"practical\" farmer is a theorist. He first\r\nbelieves that the virgin soil is inexhaustible, even though cropped\r\ncontinuously. Later he clings to the popular theory that the\r\nrotation of crops will maintain the productive capacity of the land;\r\nand it is safe to say that a large majority of the farmers of the\r\nUnited States gladly hold to the erroneous theory that clover grown\r\nonce every three to five years will increase and permanently\r\nmaintain the fertility of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe fact that clover was grown for generations on the lands of the\r\nolder Eastern states until the clover crop itself finally failed on\r\nmillions of acres now agriculturally abandoned is overlooked or\r\nforgotten by present-day farmers, especially by the descendants of\r\nthose who have gone West and settled on new, rich lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nSix Facts and a Question\r\n\r\nThe following six facts will furnish a comprehensive basis for the\r\nsolution of the nitrogen problem in practical general agriculture:\r\n\r\n(1) To produce 100 pounds of grain requires about 3 pounds of\r\nnitrogen, of which 2 pounds are deposited in the grain itself and 1\r\npound in the straw or stalks.\r\n\r\n(2) In live-stock farming one-fourth of the nitrogen in the food\r\nconsumed is retained in the animal products--meat, milk, wool, and\r\nso on--and three-fourths may be returned to the land in the\r\nexcrements if saved without loss.\r\n\r\n(3) When grown on soils of normal productive capacity legumes secure\r\nabout two-thirds of their total nitrogen from the air and one-third\r\nfrom the soil.\r\n\r\n(4) Clover and other biennial or perennial legumes have about\r\ntwo-thirds of their total nitrogen in the tops and one-third in the\r\nroots, while the roots of cowpeas and other annual legumes contain\r\nonly about one-tenth of their total nitrogen.\r\n\r\n(5) Hay made from our common legumes contains about 40 pounds of\r\nnitrogen per ton.\r\n\r\n(6) Average farm manure contains 16 pounds of nitrogen per ton.\r\n\r\nQuestion: How many tons of average farm manure must be applied to a\r\n40-acre field in order to provide as much nitrogen as would be added\r\nto the soil by plowing under 2-1/2 tons of clover per acre? Answer:\r\n400 tons.\r\n\r\nEither method will furnish about as much nitrogen as would be taken\r\nfrom the soil by a 50-bushel crop of wheat, a 75-bushel crop of corn\r\nor a 100-bushel crop of oats per acre. The decision by the\r\nindividual between live-stock farming and grain farming should be\r\nbased upon preference and profit rather than upon the erroneous\r\nteaching that farm manure is either essential or sufficient for the\r\nmaintenance of soil fertility in this country.\r\n\r\nBread is the staff of life, and many must sell grain. I do not\r\nadvise all grain farmers to become live-stock farmers; but I do\r\nadvise both grain farmers and live-stock farmers to enrich their\r\nsoils by practical, profitable and permanent methods. Both classes\r\nof farmers may secure new nitrogen--that is, they can positively\r\nincrease their nitrogen supply by sufficient use of legume crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Supply Nitrogen\r\n\r\nThe cotton-grower who sells cotton lint at 10 cents a pound and the\r\nmarket gardener who sells from $100 to $300 worth of fruits and\r\nvegetables from one acre may well make liberal use of commercial\r\nnitrogen at 15 or 20 cents a pound; but if after deducting the cost\r\nof harvesting, threshing, storing and marketing the average farmer\r\nreceives only 1 cent a pound for his grain and if 40 per cent of the\r\ncommercial nitrogen applied is lost by leaching, then the total crop\r\nof grain would bring only enough money to pay for the nitrogen\r\nrequired to produce it, at 20 cents a pound. We may sometimes advise\r\nthe American grain-grower to buy water with which to irrigate his\r\ncrop, but not to buy nitrogen with which to fertilize it.\r\n\r\nIf the grain farmer grows 40 bushels of wheat to the acre, clover\r\nhaving been seeded on the same land in order to plow under the\r\nequivalent of 1-1/2 tons of hay as green manure the following\r\nspring, and follows this by a 60-bushel crop of corn and a 50-bushel\r\ncrop of oats, and this the fourth year by two crops of clover\r\naggregating 3 tons an acre, including 2 bushels of seed, he can thus\r\nsecure from the air about 180 pounds of nitrogen in the 4-1/2 tons\r\nof clover. Moreover, if the first cutting of clover the fourth year\r\nis left on the land and the threshed clover straw from the seed crop\r\nand likewise all straw and stalks are returned to the soil, only 154\r\npounds of nitrogen an acre would leave the farm if the total grain\r\nand clover seed were sold. With 80 cents a bushel for wheat, 50\r\ncents for corn, 40 cents for oats and $8 for clover seed, the total\r\nreturns from the four acres would amount to $98.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the live-stock farmer may grow two 60-bushel crops\r\nof corn, followed by 50 bushels of oats and then 3 tons of clover\r\nhay containing 120 pounds of new nitrogen. The four crops would\r\ncontain 350 pounds of nitrogen; and if the grain and hay and half\r\nthe corn-stalks are used for feed, with the straw and the remainder\r\nof the stalks for bedding, it is likewise possible to replace the\r\n230 pounds of nitrogen required for the grain crops, provided not\r\nmore than one-seventh of the manure is lost before being returned to\r\nthe land. The important weakness on the common live-stock farm lies\r\nin the enormous waste of manure.\r\n\r\nIf 10 pounds of feed produce 1 pound increase in the live-weight of\r\nthe animals fed, and if they bring 6 cents a pound on the hoof, the\r\ngross returns aggregate $107.50 from the four acres, barring losses\r\nfrom accidents, animal diseases, and so on.\r\n\r\nThus, with a few established facts in mind, one can easily determine\r\nhow to maintain or even to increase the supply of nitrogen in the\r\nsoil, and without the purchase of nitrogen in any form; and it is\r\njust as possible and just as necessary thus to provide the nitrogen\r\nneeded in grain farming as in livestock farming. When we consider\r\nthat animals destroy two-thirds of the organic matter in the food\r\nconsumed we find that as between the two systems above described the\r\norganic matter or humus of the soil will be better maintained in the\r\ngrain system outlined.\r\n\r\n\r\nLive-Stock or Grain Farming\r\n\r\nFor those who believe that live-stock farming must be adopted for\r\nthe maintenance of fertility on all farms, attention should be\r\ncalled to the fact that there are 900,000,000 acres of farm-land in\r\nthe United States and only 90,000,000 head of live-stock equivalent\r\nto cows, including all farm animals. Will the manure from one cow\r\nserve to enrich 10 acres of land?\r\n\r\nIt should also be known that a hundred bushels of grain will support\r\nfive times as many people as could live for the same length of time\r\non the meat and milk that could be made by feeding the grain to\r\ndomestic animals. It is because of this fact that the consumer may\r\nsometimes boycott meat or other animal products, while he never\r\nboycotts bread; but let us hope that permanent systems will become\r\ngenerally adopted in America, for the production of both grain and\r\nlive stock, so that high standards of living may be maintained for\r\nall classes of people in this country.\r\n\r\nThe oldest direct comparison between these two systems of farming,\r\nso far as the writer has learned, is on the experiment fields of the\r\nUniversity of Illinois, where as an average of six years the yield\r\nof corn has been 87 bushels an acre in grain farming and 90 bushels\r\nin live-stock farming, the same crop rotation being practiced. Where\r\nwheat was introduced the average yield for six years was 43.1\r\nbushels in grain farming and 43.5 in live-stock farming.\r\n\r\nNo nitrogen was purchased in any form in either of these systems;\r\nbut clover is grown in the rotation to secure nitrogen from the air\r\nand then the crop residues or farm manure is returned to the soil to\r\nprovide sufficient nitrogen for the grain crops. In all cases\r\nphosphorus was used for these yields.\r\n\r\nEven more encouraging than these six-year average results from\r\nIllinois are the results of sixty years from Agdell Field at\r\nRothamsted.\r\n\r\nWhere mineral plant food was regularly applied, and where all the\r\nmanure produced by feeding the turnips was returned to the soil, in\r\na four-year rotation of turnips, barley, clover (or beans) and\r\nwheat, with no other provision made for supplying nitrogen, the\r\nyields per acre were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Turnips, 24,724 lbs. in 1848, and 26,410 in 1908.\r\n  Barley, 42.8 bushels in 1849 and 22.1 in 1909\r\n  Clover, 5586 pounds in 1850 and 7190 in 1910.\r\n  Wheat, 32 bushels in 1851 and 37.8 in 1911.\r\n\r\nHere we have data which span a period of sixty years and which show\r\nthat where mineral plant food has been provided the clover in\r\nrotation and the manure produced by the feeding of only one of the\r\nfour crops have maintained the yield of all crops except the\r\nbarley-the third crop after clover-and without the application of\r\nnitrogen in any other form. If the clover and straw had been\r\nreturned to the land either directly or in farm manure the\r\nadditional nitrogen thus provided would have been sufficient both to\r\nmaintain the yield of barley and to prevent the moderate decrease\r\nwhich has occurred in the nitrogen content of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORUS: THE MASTER KEY TO PERMANENT AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE greatest economic loss that America has ever sustained has been\r\nthe loss of energy and profit in farming with an inadequate supply\r\nof phosphorus. Phosphorus is a Greek word which signifies\r\n\"light-bringer\"; but it is a light which few Americans have yet\r\nseen, else we should not permit the annual exportation of more than\r\na million tons of our best phosphate rock, for which we receive at\r\nthe mines the paltry sum of five million dollars, carrying away from\r\nthe United States an amount of the one element of plant food we\r\nshall always need to buy, which if retained in this country and\r\napplied to our own soils would be worth not five million but a\r\nthousand million dollars for the production of food for the oncoming\r\ngenerations of Americans.\r\n\r\nFor five million dollars we export to Europe each year enough\r\nphosphorus for 1,400,000,000 bushels of wheat, or twice the average\r\ncrop of the entire United States. Meanwhile our ten-year-average\r\nyield of wheat is 14 bushels an acre, while Germany's yield has gone\r\nup to 29, Great Britain's to 33, England's to 37-1/2 and Denmark's\r\nto more than 40 as the average for a decade.\r\n\r\n\r\nPotato Yield Twice Doubled\r\n\r\nThere is only one place in the world where we can go for the results\r\nof soil improvement for more than a quarter of a century in\r\nconnection with the growing of potatoes. Of course this place is\r\nRothamsted, England, where as an average for twenty-six years the\r\nyield of potatoes was 51 bushels an acre on unfertilized land and\r\nexactly 102 bushels where only a phosphate fertilizer was applied.\r\nWhere the same amount of phosphorus--29 pounds of the element per\r\nacre per annum--was used in connection with other minerals--300\r\npounds of potassium sulfate and 100 pounds each of the sulfates of\r\nmagnesium and sodium--the average yield of potatoes was 109 bushels.\r\nWhere 86 pounds of nitrogen was applied in sodium nitrate the\r\naverage yield was 79 bushels; but where the nitrogen, phosphorus and\r\nother minerals were all applied the average yield for the twenty-six\r\nyears was 203 bushels.\r\n\r\nAt 50 cents a bushel for potatoes, the investment in phosphorus\r\nalone paid 600 per cent net profit; and even the complete\r\nfertilizer, including 392 pounds of acid phosphate, 550 pounds of\r\nsodium nitrate and 500 pounds of alkali salts, aggregating 1442\r\npounds, and costing at moderate prices $24.28 an acre per annum,\r\npaid back $76 a year as a twenty-six year average, thus making 300\r\nper cent even on an investment of nearly $25 an acre a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhosphorus Helps Good Farming\r\n\r\nThere is also but one place in the world where we can learn the\r\nresults secured from the application of phosphorus for a period of\r\nthirty-six years in a good system of farming; and again this place\r\nis Rothamsted.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Sir John Lawes and Sir Henry Gilbert began investigations on\r\nAgdell Field. The Norfolk rotation, already known at that time as\r\none of the best rotation systems, was turnips, barley, clover, and\r\nwheat; and in these practical field experiments the turnips were fed\r\non the land and the animal fertilizer thus produced was returned to\r\nthe soil, which was well supplied with limestone.\r\n\r\nDuring the next thirty-six years $29.52 worth of phosphorus per acre\r\nwas applied to one part of the field; and in comparison with another\r\npart of the same field cropped and managed similarly, except that no\r\nphosphorus was applied, the $29.52 worth of phosphorus produced\r\n$98.02 increase in the value of the turnips, $37.45 in barley,\r\n$48.93 in clover (and beans) and $45.99 in wheat.\r\n\r\nThe total value of the crops grown on the land not receiving\r\nphosphorus during the thirty-six years was $432.43 an acre, while on\r\nthe phosphated land the crop values amounted to $662.82, an increase\r\nof $230.39 from an investment of $29.52, the turnips being figured\r\nat $1.40 a ton, barley at 50 cents a bushel, clover hay at $6 a ton,\r\nbeans at $1.25 a bushel, wheat at 70 cents a bushel, and phosphorus\r\nat 12 cents a pound. As a general average at these conservative\r\nprices, the investment of $3.28 an acre every four years paid back\r\n$25.60 in the four crops.\r\n\r\nIn most states the legal rate of interest is 6 per cent but here is\r\nan investment that paid the principal and 680 per cent interest\r\nevery four years. And these investigations show that the phosphorus\r\nwas used with profit for the production of markedly different crops,\r\nincluding potatoes and turnips, barley and wheat, clover and beans.\r\n\r\nBut the soil at Rothamsted is no poorer in phosphorus than is the\r\naverage soil of the United States; and these results are given here\r\nnot only because they are the oldest and most trustworthy the world\r\naffords, but because they are strictly applicable to the production\r\nof common crops on vast areas of agricultural land in our own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Form of Phosphorus to Use\r\n\r\nThe unfertilized soil at the Rothamsted station contains, in\r\n2,000,000 pounds--corresponding to about 6-2/3 inches to the\r\nacre--1000 pounds of phosphorus and 35,000 of potassium, while an\r\nacre of plowed soil of the same weight at State College,\r\nPennsylvania, contains 1100 pounds of phosphorus and 50,700 of\r\npotassium.\r\n\r\nIn a word, normal soils are deficient in phosphorus, and the\r\napplication of phosphorus in good systems of farming produces marked\r\nand profitable increases in crop yields. But what form of phosphorus\r\nshall we apply? This is a very important question in agricultural\r\neconomics, for we have many different kinds of fertilizing materials\r\nthat contain phosphorus, and one may cost ten times as much as\r\nanother as a source of phosphorus. Thus 250 pounds of phosphorus in\r\na ton of finely ground natural rock phosphate can be purchased at\r\nthe mines in Tennessee and delivered at the farmer's railway station\r\nin the heart of the Corn Belt for $8. Or the ton of raw phosphate\r\nmay be mixed with a ton of sulfuric acid in the fertilizer factory,\r\nand the two tons of acid phosphate may be sold to the same farmer\r\nfor $32. Or the fertilizer manufacturer may mix the two tons of acid\r\nphosphate with two tons of \"filler,\" containing a little nitrogen\r\nand potassium, and then sell the same farmer the four tons of\r\nso-called \"complete\" fertilizer for $80; and the farmer gets no more\r\nphosphorus in the four tons of \"complete\" fertilizer for $80 than in\r\nthe one ton of natural phosphate for $8.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania State College conducted an experiment for twelve\r\nyears--1884 to 1895--in which $1.05 an acre was invested in ground\r\nraw rock phosphate with a rotation of corn, oats, wheat and hay\r\n(clover and timothy), and the value of the increase produced by the\r\nphosphorus amounted to $5.85 as an average for the twelve years, and\r\nto $8.41 as an average for the last four years. Thus the profit was\r\nfrom about 560 to 800 per cent on the investment, counting corn at\r\n35 cents a bushel, oats at 30 cents, wheat at 70 cents, and hay at\r\n$6 a ton. These figures represent the increase produced by\r\nphosphorus over and above the value of the crops grown without\r\nphosphorus fertilizer. In this case no farm manure was used on\r\neither part of the field; but commercial nitrogen and potassium were\r\napplied alike on both parts, and clover was grown in the rotation.\r\n\r\nAcid phosphate was also used in direct comparison; and, in answer to\r\nthe question whether the general farmer should apply liberal amounts\r\nof finely ground natural rock phosphate, or whether he should pay\r\nfour times as much for phosphorus after the fertilizer manufacturer\r\nhas mixed one part of the raw rock with one of sulfuric acid and\r\nthus produced two parts of acid phosphate, these Pennsylvania\r\nexperiments tell us that the yearly average for the twelve years\r\ngave a gain per year of $2.45 from the raw phosphate and 48 cents\r\nfrom the acid phosphate, at the prices used by the Pennsylvania\r\nExperiment Station. But we must not draw general conclusions from\r\nthis one experiment, even though it covers twelve years.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 the Maryland Experiment Station began field experiments with\r\ndifferent forms of phosphorus; and, as an average of six tests every\r\nyear for twelve years, $1.965 invested in ground raw rock phosphate\r\nproduced increases in corn, wheat and hay that were worth $22.11, at\r\n35 cents a bushel for corn, 70 cents for wheat, $6 a ton for hay,\r\nand 3 cents a pound for phosphorus in the ground natural phosphate.\r\nHow would you like 1000 per cent profit as the result of mixing\r\nbrain with brawn, in connection with the improvement of your own\r\nbusiness, thus keeping the investment under your own control?\r\n\r\nMind you, this does not prove that farming is profitable, but only\r\nthat the intelligent use of phosphorus in farming is profitable. In\r\nother words the admixture--brains--is profitable.\r\n\r\nIn commenting upon his investigations the director of the Maryland\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station states that the raw phosphate\r\nproduced a higher total average yield than acid phosphate, and at\r\nless than half the cost.\r\n\r\nThe Rhode Island Experiment Station began a series of experiments\r\nwith different forms of phosphorus in 1894. If we add together all\r\nthe hay and grain crops grown during the decade following the first\r\nyear of these experiments, we find that the increases per acre were\r\n14,580 pounds for raw phosphate and 14,550 pounds for acid\r\nphosphate, on unlimed land; while lime and raw phosphate produced\r\n27,030 pounds, and lime and acid phosphate 29,690 pounds, of\r\nincrease; and the acid phosphate cost three times as much as the raw\r\nphosphate.\r\n\r\nIn commenting upon these investigations the director of the Rhode\r\nIsland Experiment Station states that the raw phosphate gave very\r\ngood results with such farm crops as oats, peas, crimson clover,\r\nmillet, soy beans, and so forth, but very poor results with such\r\ngarden crops as turnips, rutabagas, cabbage, beets, lettuce, squash,\r\nand so forth, and its use for these garden crops is not advised.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the Massachusetts Experiment Station began investigations\r\nwith different phosphates applied in equal money value, and in his\r\nreport for 1900 the director states that the raw rock phosphate\r\nranks above the acid phosphate both as an average for the entire\r\nperiod and as an average between 1895 and 1900, during which time\r\nthe land to which no phosphorus was applied produced only 55 per\r\ncent as much as where raw phosphate was used--a result worth every\r\nfarmer's consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Bushels and Tons\r\n\r\nThe Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station has reported investigations\r\ncovering sixteen years in which raw phosphate was compared with acid\r\nphosphate costing twice as much per acre. As an average of all\r\nresults secured, 320 pounds of raw phosphate applied with manure on\r\nclover sod produced 8.4 bushels more corn, 4.7 bushels more wheat,\r\nand 0.49 ton more hay per acre than where manure alone was used, and\r\n320 pounds of acid phosphate, costing twice as much money but\r\ncontaining only half as much phosphorus, applied with the same\r\namount of manure, produced 7.5 bushels more corn, 5.1 bushels more\r\nwheat, and 0.46 ton more hay than where the manure alone was used.\r\n\r\nNow I have presented the averages or summaries of all investigations\r\nthat have been reported covering ten years or more where equal money\r\nvalues of raw phosphate and acid phosphate have been used, or where\r\nany apparent provision was made to supply some organic manure,\r\nwhether as farm manure, green manure or merely as clover grown in\r\nthe rotation; and I invite the reader to mix his own brains with\r\nthese data and not to expect me to state whether he should use the\r\nrelatively cheap ground natural phosphate rock or the more costly\r\nmanufactured acidulated phosphate in the improvement of his own soil\r\nin systems of permanent profitable agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking Phosphate Available\r\n\r\nIf the natural rock is used it should be ground so that at least 90\r\nper cent will pass through a sieve with 10,000 meshes to the square\r\ninch, and of course its content of phosphorus (from 12 to 15 per\r\ncent) or of so-called \"phosphoric acid\" (from 27 to 34 per cent)\r\nshould also be guaranteed. Moreover it should be used liberally and\r\nin connection with plenty of decaying organic matter. People\r\nsometimes ask, \"How much of the phosphorus in raw phosphate is\r\navailable?\" The best answer to this question is, \"None of it; and,\r\nif you are not going to make it available, don't use it.\"\r\n\r\nOn my own farm I use about one ton per acre of raw phosphate once\r\nevery six years, thus adding at least 250 pounds of phosphorus at a\r\ncost of less than $8; whereas 200 pounds of the common \"complete\"\r\nfertilizer per acre yearly would cost $12 every six years, and would\r\nsupply only 40 pounds of phosphorus. I do not use \"complete\"\r\nfertilizers, because there is plenty of nitrogen in the air and\r\nplenty of potassium in the soil; and because, by growing and plowing\r\nunder plenty of clover, I not only secure nitrogen from the air and\r\nliberate potassium from the soil but also liberate the phosphorus\r\nfrom the raw rock phosphate applied to the soil. In beginning the\r\nuse of raw phosphate where the supply of organic manures is limited,\r\nI apply one ton of phosphate and 600 pounds of kainit in intimate\r\nconnection, turn them under, preferably with organic matter, then\r\nadd ground limestone if needed, and thus prepare to grow clover.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important agencies under the farmer's control for\r\nthe liberation of plant food are the decomposition products of\r\nfermenting or decaying organic matter, such as green manures, crop\r\nresidues and ordinary farm manures. In the decomposition of these\r\norganic materials sour or acid products are formed. Thus vinegar,\r\ncontaining acetic acid, is formed from the fermentation of apple\r\njuice, hard cider being an intermediate product. Sweet, chopped,\r\nimmature field corn becomes sour silage in the silo, lactic, acetic,\r\ncarbonic and other acids being formed. By a similar process cabbage\r\nis turned into sauerkraut. Likewise sweet milk becomes sour, with\r\nthe formation of lactic acid. Oxalic, citric, tartaric, succinic,\r\nmalic, gallic and tannic are other well-known organic acids. Some of\r\nthese are contained in the sap or juice of certain plants, and these\r\nor others are formed when crop residues are decomposed in the soil.\r\n\r\nIn the ultimate decomposition of organic matter the carbon appears\r\nin the form of carbon dioxid which when combined with water forms\r\ncarbonic acid. Though this is a very weak acid, its solvent action\r\nis very important.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to the various organic acids and carbonic acid, we\r\nhave also to consider the formation of nitric acid in connection\r\nwith the decomposition of organic manures. Nitric acid is one of the\r\nstrongest known, and in solvent power it is excelled by no single\r\nacid. The nitrogen contained in crop residues and other organic\r\nmanures is chiefly in chemical combination with carbon, oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, much of it in insoluble protein compounds. Normally this\r\norganic nitrogen is transformed in the soil, first into ammonia\r\nnitrogen, next into nitrite nitrogen, and lastly into nitrate\r\nnitrogen, these three transformations being effected by biochemical\r\naction produced by different kinds of living microscopic organisms\r\ncalled bacteria. Though detectable amounts of free nitric acid do\r\nnot accumulate during this process of nitrification, the soluble\r\nnitrate or final product is formed by the action of nitric acid upon\r\na mineral base, such as calcium, magnesium, or potassium, which may\r\nhave been in the soil in insoluble form, so that the nitrogen must\r\npass through the form of nitric acid in the transformation into\r\nnitrates.\r\n\r\nWhile the organic matter applied to the soil contains about twenty\r\ntimes as much carbon as nitrogen, and while corresponding amounts of\r\ncarbonic acid and important amounts of intermediate organic acids\r\nmust be formed, it is of much interest to know that even the nitric\r\nacid formed in the transformation of organic nitrogen to nitrate\r\nnitrogen in sufficient quantity for a given crop is seven times as\r\nmuch acid as would be required to convert raw rock phosphate into\r\nsoluble phosphate to furnish the phosphorus required for the same\r\ncrop. A knowledge of this definite quantitative relationship should\r\nhelp us to appreciate the possibilities of decaying organic manures\r\nin the important matter of making plant food available, including\r\npotassium, calcium and magnesium as well as phosphorus and nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe value of rye, rape, buckwheat and other non-legumes when used as\r\ngreen manures is very largely due to the liberation of plant food by\r\ntheir decomposition in contact with the natural phosphates, potash\r\nand other minerals contained in the soil. The farmer has no more\r\nimportant business than that of making plant food available,\r\nespecially by supplying liberal amounts of decaying organic matter.\r\n\r\nThe following suggestions are offered to the land owner:\r\n\r\nTo enrich the soil apply liberal amounts of limestone, organic\r\nmanures and phosphorus.\r\n\r\nTo enrich the seller apply small amounts of high-priced \"complete\"\r\ncommercial fertilizers.\r\n\r\nThus the average of seventy-three \"Cooperative Fertilizer Tests on\r\nClay and Loam Soils,\" extending into thirty-eight different counties\r\nin Indiana (Bulletin 155), shows 13 cents as the farmer's profit\r\nfrom each dollar spent for \"complete\" fertilizers used for corn,\r\noats, wheat, timothy, and potatoes, if valued in the field at 40\r\ncents a bushel for corn, 30 cents for oats, 80 cents for wheat, 50\r\ncents for potatoes, and at $10 a ton for hay, over and above the\r\nextra expense for harvesting and marketing the increase, and of\r\ncourse the soil grows poorer, because the crops harvested removed\r\nmuch more plant food than the fertilizers supplied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPERMANENT SOIL FERTILITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIts Relation to Profits and Future Values\r\n\r\nTHOUGH intelligent soil improvement is the most profitable business\r\nin which an honest man can engage, ordinary farming is not a highly\r\nremunerative occupation, and to a large extent the fortune of the\r\nfarmer is bound up with the increase or depreciation in the market\r\nvalue of his land. There are at least three important factors of\r\ninfluence which induce people to continue farming:\r\n\r\nFirst, the farmer is his own employer. He controls his own job, is\r\nhis own boss and has no superior officer to lay him off because of\r\ndisagreement, dull business or political preferment. Farmers\r\nconstitute by far the largest class of citizens who own their own\r\nbusiness, and are thus \"independent.\"\r\n\r\nSecond, the farmer is able as a rule to make some sort of a living\r\nfor his family very largely out of the produce of the farm, so that\r\nhe gets some return for his labor in terms of food, even when there\r\nis no profit in farming as a business; whereas the wage-earner of\r\nthe city, as soon as his wages stop and his savings and credit are\r\nexhausted, must see his family supported by charity or starve. This\r\nis not fiction, but fact.\r\n\r\nThird, land is usually considered a safe investment, in which one\r\nmay hold a perfect and undivided title to his property; and people\r\nwill retain possession of a farm even when it pays a low rate of\r\ninterest, rather than sell and invest the proceeds in some other\r\nenterprise which they cannot control as individuals or which may\r\nsuddenly depreciate in earning power, fail or be utterly destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs Land a Safe Investment?\r\n\r\nThough it is true that farm land does not pass out of existence in a\r\nday, nevertheless it is by no means a safe investment, as witness\r\nthe numerous abandoned farms in the older agricultural sections of\r\nthis new country. It is easily possible for one of means to become\r\nland-poor--to have investments in land which will not pay the taxes\r\nand upkeep of buildings, fences and so forth. At prevailing prices\r\nfor farm produce and labor there are vast areas of land in the older\r\nstates far past the point of possible self-redemption; and, as a\r\nmatter of business, one might better burn his money and save his\r\nenergy than to expend all his resources in half-paying for such\r\ndepleted land, depending upon the immediate income from it to raise\r\na mortgage covering the unpaid balance.\r\n\r\nIntelligent optimism is admirable, but fact is better than fiction;\r\nand blind bigotry paraded as optimism is dangerous and condemnable.\r\nSome one has said that such a bigot is not an optimist but a\r\n\"cheerful idiot.\" To purchase rich, well-watered land at a low price\r\nand become wealthy by merely waiting till the land increases in\r\nvalue tenfold, while making a living by taking fertility from the\r\nsoil, has been easy and common in the great agricultural states\r\nduring the last half-century. But, paradoxical as it may seem, land\r\nvalues have increased while fertility and productiveness have\r\ndecreased and, with shorter days for higher priced and less\r\nefficient farm labor, with more middlemen absorbing the profits\r\nbetween the producer and the consumer, it is now difficult indeed to\r\nbuy land with borrowed money and pay for it from subsequent farm\r\nprofits. If continued soil depletion is practiced, ultimate failure\r\nis the only future for such investments.\r\n\r\nThat vast areas of land once cultivated with profit in the original\r\nthirteen states now lie agriculturally abandoned is common\r\nknowledge; and that the farm lands of the great Corn Belt and Wheat\r\nBelt of the North-Central states are even now undergoing the most\r\nrapid soil depletion ever witnessed is known to all who possess the\r\nfacts. Unless this tendency is checked these lands will go the way\r\nof the abandoned farms.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Broad Facts\r\n\r\nThe United States Bureau of the Census reports that the total\r\nproduction of our five great grain crops--corn, wheat, oats, barley\r\nand rye--amounted to 4,414,000,000 bushels in 1899, and to\r\n4,445,000,000 bushels in 1909, an increase of less than one per\r\ncent. Furthermore, if we assume the average production reported by\r\nthe United States Department of Agriculture for the three-year\r\nperiods 1898 to 1900 and 1908 to 1910 as the normal for 1899, and\r\n1909, respectively, and compare these averages with the production\r\nactually reported by that department for 1899 and 1909, we find that\r\nas an average of all these crops 1909 was a slightly more favorable\r\nseason than 1899, which indicates that with strictly comparable\r\nseasons the increase from 1899 to 1909 was less than 1/2 per cent in\r\nthe production of these five great grain crops of the United States.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Bureau of Census reports that during the same\r\ndecade the acreage of farm land in the United States increased by\r\n4.8 per cent, and that the acreage of improved farm land-that is,\r\nfarmed land-increased by 154 per cent. Thus the census data plainly\r\nshow reduced yield per acre. In addition we have actual records\r\nwhich show that during the decade our wheat exports decreased from\r\n210,000,000 to 108,000,000 bushels, and that our corn exports\r\ndecreased from 196,000,000 to 49,000,000 bushels, in order to help\r\nfeed the increase of 21 per cent in our population. And yet the\r\npeople complained of the high cost of plain living and many have\r\nbeen forced to adopt lower standards for the table. Meanwhile the\r\nvalue of the farm land in the United States increased by 118 per cent\r\nduring the ten years--from $13,000,000,000 to $28,500,000,000--as\r\nreported by the Bureau of Census.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Value of Land\r\n\r\nThe great primary reason why land values have increased so markedly\r\nduring the last thirty years is that America has no more free land\r\nof good quality in humid sections. Civilized man is characterized by\r\nhunger for the ownership of land. Our population continues to\r\nincrease by more than 20 per cent each decade, but all future\r\npossible additions to the farm lands of the United States amount to\r\nonly 9 per cent of the present acreage, and most of this small\r\naddition requires expensive irrigation or drainage.\r\n\r\nIf it cost $4 an acre to raise corn, 5 cents a bushel to harvest and\r\nmarket the crop, 9 cents a bushel to maintain the fertility of the\r\nsoil, and 1/2 per cent on the value of the land for taxes, then, if\r\nmoney is worth 5 per cent, land that produces 20 bushels of 40-cent\r\ncorn is worth $21.81 an acre. On the same basis, what would land be\r\nworth that produces 40 bushels of corn and equivalent values of\r\nother crops? At first thought one might say, $43.62; but this answer\r\nwould be far from the correct one, which is $116.36.\r\n\r\nAnd, if we again double the yield, making it 80 bushels an acre, the\r\nvalue of the land becomes not $87.24, and not $232.72; but easy\r\ncomputation will show that the gross receipts from an 80-bushel crop\r\nwill pay $7.20 an acre for soil enrichment, $4 for raising the crop,\r\n$4 for harvesting and marketing, $1.53 for taxes and 5 per cent\r\ninterest on a valuation of $305.45 an acre.\r\n\r\nThe average yield of corn in the United States is only 25 bushels an\r\nacre, and the average net returns even from the farms of the Corn\r\nBelt will not pay 4 per cent interest on their present market value.\r\nBut the intelligent investment of $2 an acre annually in positive\r\nsoil enrichment will increase the crop yield by two bushels of corn\r\neach year--or by equivalent amounts of other crops grown in the\r\nrotation--and will maintain this increase for at least a dozen years\r\non the average land now under cultivation in the United States; and\r\nno other safe investment can be named that will pay so great\r\nreturns. Of course, the cost is $1 a bushel for the first year's\r\nincrease, and even the second year the 4 bushels of corn cost $2;\r\nbut what is the cost per bushel of the increase the tenth year? It\r\nis 10 cents; and the twelfth year the 24 bushels of increase cost\r\nonly 8-1/3 cents a bushel, with a return of nearly 500 per cent on\r\nthe annual investment in soil improvement.\r\n\r\nAnd this is not based on mere theoretical considerations. The\r\naverage Corn-Belt land is producing only 40 bushels of corn to the\r\nacre; while a six-year average yield of 90 bushels has been produced\r\non the common Corn-Belt land with proper and profitable soil\r\ntreatment. Thus is it too much for any farmer to adopt a definite\r\nsystem based upon established practical scientific information which\r\nmakes it possible for his yield to increase from 40 bushels to an\r\naverage of 64 bushels an acre? But let him make sure that the system\r\nhe adopts is cumulative and truly permanent, and not merely\r\nstimulating and temporary.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Phosphorus Did on One Farm\r\n\r\nOn his 500-acre farm near Gilman, in the heart of the Illinois Corn\r\nBelt, Mr. Frank I. Mann has produced a 70-bushel average yield of\r\ncorn for a five-year period, and with 200 acres of land in corn\r\nannually. It cost him only $1 an acre a year in fine-ground natural\r\nrock phosphate to produce increased yields of 16 bushels more corn,\r\n23 bushels more oats and 1 ton more clover than the average yields\r\nsecured without adding phosphorus.\r\n\r\nBut this progressive, practical farmer is only putting into\r\nprofitable practice the results of the long-continued careful\r\ninvestigations with raw phosphate conducted by such public-service\r\ninstitutions as the agricultural experiment stations of\r\nPennsylvania, Maryland, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Ohio and\r\nIllinois. He knows also that on four different fields of typical\r\nCorn-Belt land in McLean county, Illinois, the total crop values per\r\nacre for a period of ten years were $148.75 $151-30, $149.43 and\r\n$149.96, respectively, and that on four other adjoining or\r\nintervening fields, which differed only by two liberal additions of\r\nphosphorus during the ten years, the respective crop values for the\r\nsame time were $229,37, $221.30, $229.20 and $225.57.\r\n\r\nOf course, Mr. Mann does not buy nitrogen, but he takes it from the\r\ninexhaustible supply in the air by means of clover and alfalfa or\r\nother legumes. He does not buy potassium because he knows how to\r\nliberate it from the inexhaustible supply contained in the soil, and\r\nbecause he knows that in the Illinois investigation just cited the\r\ncrop values from four different fields not receiving potassium were\r\n$148.75, $151.30, $229.37 and $221.30; while four other adjoining\r\nfields, which differed only by liberal applications of potassium,\r\nproduced during the same ten years $149.43, $149.96, $229.20 and\r\n$225.57, respectively.\r\n\r\nThus, as a general average, phosphorus increased the crop values by\r\n$76.50 an acre, which amounts to more than 300 per cent on the\r\ninvestment, and at the end of the ten years the soil on the best\r\ntreated and highest yielding land was 10 per cent richer in\r\nphosphorus than at the beginning; while the crops from the\r\nunfertilized land removed an amount of phosphorus equal to nearly\r\none-tenth of the total supply in the plowed soil. But a similar\r\ngeneral average shows that potassium produced increased crop values\r\nworth only 86 cents, or 3 per cent of its cost.\r\n\r\nWhat other results should be expected from land containing in the\r\nplowed soil of an acre less than 1200 pounds of phosphorus and more\r\nthan 36,000 pounds of potassium?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Working\" the Land\r\n\r\nIf there is one agricultural fact that needs to be impressed upon\r\nthe American people it is that the farmers of this country have been\r\nliving, not upon the interest from their investments, but upon their\r\nprincipal; and whatever measure of apparent prosperity they have had\r\nhas been taken from their capital stock. The boastful statement\r\nsometimes made, that the American landowner has become a scientific\r\nfarmer, is as erroneous as it is optimistic. Such statements are\r\nbased upon a few selected examples or rare illustrations, and not\r\nupon any adequate knowledge of general farm practice. Even to this\r\ndate almost every effort put forth by the mass of American farmers\r\nhas resulted in decreasing the fertility of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe productive power of normal land in humid climates depends almost\r\nwholly upon the power of the soil to feed the crop; but the American\r\nfarmer does everything except to restore to the soil the plant food\r\nrequired to maintain permanently its crop-producing power. These\r\nought be to have done, but not to leave the other undone. Thus, tile\r\ndrainage adds nothing to the soil out of which crops are made, but\r\nonly permits the removal of more fertility in the larger crops\r\nproduced on the well-drained land. More thorough tillage with our\r\nimproved implements of cultivation is merely \"working the land for\r\nall that's in it.\" The use of better seed produces larger crops, but\r\nonly at the expense of the soil. Even the farm manure is so limited\r\nand is spread so thinly with manure-spreaders made for the purpose\r\nthat it adds but little to the soil in comparison with the crops\r\nremoved and sold in grain and hay as well as in meat and milk.\r\nClover, as commonly produced and harvested, adds little or no\r\nnitrogen to the soil.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary high-priced, manufactured, acidulated, so-called\r\n\"complete\" commercial fertilizers, in the small amounts that farmers\r\ncan afford to use, and do use quite generally in the older states,\r\nserve in part as soil-stimulants and commonly leave the land poorer\r\nyear by year; and if the farmers of the great Corn and Wheat Belts\r\nare ever to adopt systems of permanent agriculture, it must be done\r\nin the near future, or they too will awake to find their lands\r\nimpoverished beyond self-redemption.\r\n\r\nEven in the state of Massachusetts, where a most active campaign has\r\nbeen waged for forty years by the mixed commercial fertilizer\r\ninterests, urging and persuading many farmers to use their\r\nhigh-priced artificial soil stimulants, very large areas of land are\r\nbeing agriculturally abandoned. Thus the following statement appears\r\nin the report of the United States Bureau of Census in regard to the\r\nfarm land of Massachusetts:\r\n\r\n\"The area of improved land decreased without interruption until in\r\n1910 it was only about one-half what it was in 1880.\"\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten, however, that market gardeners often\r\nsell from $100 to $300 worth of produce from an acre and they can\r\nwell afford to use large amounts of soluble commercial plant food\r\n(acid phosphate, nitrates, etc.) as well as animal manures from the\r\ncities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the Soil Inexhaustible?\r\n\r\nIt is not the fault of the farmer alone that soil-robbing and land\r\nruin have followed his work in America. Neither the average farmer\r\nof today nor any of his ancestors received any agricultural\r\ninstruction in the schools; and the greedy fertilizer agent has\r\npersuaded him to buy his patent soil medicine and has taken $100 of\r\nthe farmer's money and given him in return only $10 worth of what he\r\nreally needs to buy; and even the Bureau of Soils of the Federal\r\nGovernment has for several years promulgated the erroneous and\r\ncondemnable theory expressed in the following quotations:\r\n\r\n\"From the modern conception of the nature and purpose of the soil it\r\nis evident that it cannot wear out; that, so far as the mineral food\r\nis concerned, it will continue automatically to supply adequate\r\nquantities of the mineral plant foods for crops.\" (United States\r\nBureau of Soils, Bulletin No. 55, p. 79.)\r\n\r\n\"There is another way in which the fertility of the soil can be\r\nmaintained: namely, by arranging a system of rotation and growing\r\neach year a crop that is not injured by the excreta of the preceding\r\ncrop: then when the time comes round for the first crop to be\r\nplanted again, the soil has had ample time to dispose of the sewage\r\nresulting from the growth of the plant two or three years before.\"\r\n(United States Farmers' Bulletin No. 257, p. 21.)\r\n\r\n\"The soil is the one indestructible, immutable asset that the nation\r\npossesses. It is the one resource that cannot be exhausted; that\r\ncannot be used up.\" (United States Bureau of Soils, Bulletin No. 55,\r\np. 66.)\r\n\r\nAnd these are only samples of the false teaching spread abroad by\r\nthis bureau of theorists, even though the congressmen of the United\r\nStates can not enter the capitol of the nation from any direction\r\nwithout passing depleted and agriculturally abandoned lands. Is it\r\nnot in order to ask the Congress or the president of the United\r\nStates how long the American farmer is to be burdened with these\r\npernicious, disproved and condemnable doctrines poured forth and\r\nspread abroad by the Federal Bureau of Soils?\r\n\r\nIt is true that these erroneous teachings have been opposed or\r\nridiculed in Europe; they have been denounced by the Association of\r\nOfficial Agricultural Chemists of the United States, and rejected by\r\nevery land-grant college and agricultural experiment station that\r\nhas been heard from, including those in forty-seven states; and yet\r\nthis doctrine, emanating from what should be the position of highest\r\nauthority, is the most potent of all existing influences to prevent\r\nthe proper care of our soils.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Values in Land\r\n\r\nIt was Baron von Liebig who taught, both in Germany and in England,\r\nthat--\"it is not the land itself that constitutes the farmer's\r\nwealth, but it is in the constituents of the soil, which serve for\r\nthe nutrition of plants, that this wealth truly consists.\" And it is\r\nin the application of this teaching, completely verified by sixty\r\nyears of investigation and demonstration by Lawes and Gilbert at\r\nRothamsted, that England has been able to raise her 10-year average\r\nyield of wheat to 37-1/2 bushels an acre, while the average for the\r\nUnited States stands at 14 bushels.\r\n\r\nIn Illinois, where the agricultural college and experiment station,\r\nthe state farmers' institute and the agricultural press have been\r\nworking in perfect co-operation in teaching and demonstrating the\r\nneed and value of soil enrichment as well as of seed selection and\r\nproper tillage, the 10-year average yield of wheat is already 3\r\nbushels higher and the 10-year average yield of corn is 7-1/2\r\nbushels higher than the averages for the 25-year period ending with\r\n1890, before the definite information from Illinois investigations\r\nbegan to be widely disseminated; and yet it must be confessed that\r\non the average Illinois is producing only 16 bushels of wheat and 36\r\nbushels of corn to the acre, which is less than half a crop,\r\nmeasured by the possibilities of our soil and climate.\r\n\r\nBut what shall we say of Georgia, both an older and a larger state,\r\nand with far better climatic conditions for corn, yet with a 10-year\r\naverage yield of less than 12 bushels of corn to the acre,\r\nnotwithstanding the yearly expenditure of $20,000,000 for more than\r\n2000 different brands of commercial fertilizers that have been\r\nbought by Georgia farmers? The facts are that while some profit can\r\nbe secured from the use of high-priced mixed commercial fertilizers\r\nfor cotton with lint at 10 cents a pound, they scarcely pay their\r\ncost when used for corn, even at Georgia prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorking Mind and Muscle\r\n\r\nBut Georgia spends money enough for fertilizers to double the\r\naverage crop yields of the entire state within a decade if wisely\r\ninvested in positive soil enrichment in rational permanent systems\r\nof agriculture.\r\n\r\nWhy should not the farmers of Georgia and other Southern states be\r\nbrought to understand and to apply the results of those most\r\nvaluable investigations conducted by the Louisiana Experiment\r\nStation on typical worn upland soil of the South, which show that\r\nthe use of organic manures produced upon the farm-farm manure,\r\nlegume cover-crops and cottonseed meal--re-enforced by liberal\r\nadditions of phosphorus, increased the crop yields from 466 to 1514\r\npounds per acre of seed cotton, from 9.4 to 31.4 bushels of corn,\r\nand from 16.4 to 41.8 bushels of oats, as the averages for nineteen\r\nyears?\r\n\r\nThis experiment occupied 6 acres of land, but when the results are\r\napplied to a 60-acre farm it is found that the gross returns from\r\nthe untreated land would amount to $595.76, while the net returns\r\nfrom the soil treatment amount to $956.08 annually, both the value\r\nof produce and the cost of fertilizer being computed at the prices\r\nthat were used by the Louisiana Experiment Station.\r\n\r\nThus the combined _gross_ earning power of both land and labor is\r\nless than $600 a year; while the brain work applied to the\r\nimprovement of the soil on the same farm brings a net return of more\r\nthan $950. Once in three years 50 pounds an acre of kainit was also\r\napplied. This would contain only 5 pounds of potassium, or less than\r\nwould be required for one 7-bushel crop of corn.\r\n\r\nThese are the oldest experiments in the United States in which\r\norganic manures have been re-enforced with phosphorus, and the only\r\naddition suggested for the profitable improvement of this system is\r\nground limestone on acid soils. These results only emphasize the\r\nfact that the average farm yields small returns upon the capital and\r\nlabor invested, but the statement may well be repeated that the\r\nintelligent improvement of his soil, in systems of permanent\r\nagriculture, is the most profitable business in which the farmer and\r\nland owner can engage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S NOTE\r\n\r\nThe following generous statements are quoted here only because of\r\nthe hope and earnest desire that those who have read the preceding\r\npages may continue their study of the soil--the foundation of all\r\nagriculture--until they master the subject, and make their own the\r\nexisting knowledge of the fundamental principles of permanent soil\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Another Great Sermon\"\r\n\r\nHave you read it? It is \"The Story of the Soil,\" by Doctor Cyril G.\r\nHopkins, and not since the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin has any\r\nwriter in the world produced a book of such tremendous importance to\r\npresent and future generations.

It has a love story running through it,\r\nand it has an index, not a usual appendix to a novel. And yet it is\r\nnot really a novel, but a scientific book on agriculture. There is\r\njust enough story to entice the less willing reader to absorb some\r\nof the latest results of soil analysis. The young man of the story\r\nvisits Virginia and New England, with a view to purchasing a\r\nworn-out farm and building it up. He finally buys such a farm, and\r\nby the methods carefully explained restores it to fertility and\r\nprofit.

The result is remarkable; a clear\r\naccount is given of the soil in relation to the crop, and the\r\ninterest of the subject is broadened by skillfully weaving in the\r\nthreads of a mild novel.

E.J.\r\nRussell, _Director of the Rothamsted Experiment Station,\r\nEngland,--from \"Nature.\"_\r\n\r\nIn this book Dr. Hopkins has embodied in the shape of an interesting\r\nstory, dealing with life on a farm, the science of soil fertility\r\nand permanent agriculture. He has demonstrated how the most badly\r\nrun-down soil can be restored to more than virgin fertility, and\r\nwith profit in the doing of the work.--Editor J. F. JACKSON, _of the\r\nSouthern Planter, Richmond, Va._\r\n\r\nI wish that every farmer and farmer's family in the land could read\r\n\"The Story of the Soil,\" for it gives in a nutshell the results of\r\nyears of patient study and investigation upon the most vital\r\nquestion that now confronts the farmer: How shall he conserve his\r\nsoil? I have read it with great pleasure and profit.--FRED L. HATCH,\r\n_Farmer, Spring Grove, Ill._\r\n\r\nIn the form of a story--a real, live, interesting story--the book\r\ndevelops a very large number of highly important facts in connection\r\nwith soils and farm fertility. We have not seen anything like it\r\nbefore and owing to the hold it gets upon the reader it will be a\r\npower in carrying soil and fertility facts to many who would not\r\nread the purely scientific works. The author is a leading authority\r\nand the statements in the book are reliable.--_Ohio Farmer._\r\n\r\n\"The Story of the Soil,\" by Cyril G. Hopkins, Professor of Soils and\r\nCrops, University of Illinois, a practical farmer and a scientific\r\nsoil investigator; a book of 360 pages printed on heavy wove white\r\npaper, in strong and durable binding; illustrated with photographic\r\nreproductions of actual results secured in profitable systems of\r\npermanent soil improvement; with comprehensive index and glossary.\r\nPrice $1.00 Can also be obtained from the publisher for $1.12\r\npostpaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Farm That Won't Wear Out, by Cyril G.
