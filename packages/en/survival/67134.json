H. HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAVOR IN MILK AND ITS PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: =Flavor: How tested?=]\r\n\r\nGood flavor sells milk, cream, butter and cheese; poor flavor condemns\r\nthem. Flavor is that indescribable something, which, in good dairy\r\nproducts, appeals pleasantly to our senses, but often passes unnoticed\r\nbecause so familiar; in poor products it is equally indescribable, but\r\nmore often characterized in vigorous language, when “frowzy” butter,\r\n“garlicy” milk, “bitter” cream or “strong” cheese present their\r\noffensive odors and tastes. The ordinary consumer calls flavor the\r\n“taste” of the article which tickles his palate; but the expert knows\r\nthat the nerves of smell play the larger part, and he depends for his\r\njudgment largely upon a trained nose. Hence we see the butter judge\r\nor cheese scorer pass the trier beneath his nostrils with deep-drawn\r\nbreath and meditative study of the aroma which arises. Smells, however,\r\ncannot be measured in degrees or separated into their elements by the\r\nspectroscope; therefore we have to depend upon general terms, often\r\ndiffering with the different experts, in our discussion of flavor; yet\r\nwe have some well-marked classes which serve as a basis for reference.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: =Faults of flavor classified.=]\r\n\r\nWe can separate the faulty flavors into classes by their origin. The\r\nminute particles thrown off by dairy products, whose impact upon tongue\r\nor nostrils give rise to taste or smell, may come (1) from compounds in\r\nthe food of the cow or developed in her body (2) from matters, other\r\nthan germs, taken up by the milk while it stands in poorly-ventilated\r\nstables or rooms reeking with foul smells, or (3) from substances which\r\nare the direct or indirect result of the activity of living organisms\r\nin the milk.\r\n\r\nOdors of the first class will be most noticeable while the milk is\r\nwarm from the cow and will not increase with time. They are really\r\nfar less common than dairymen generally believe and may be avoided\r\nalmost entirely by careful feeding. Garlic, turnips, cabbage and such\r\n“fragrant” edibles will, of course, taint the milk if they are fed\r\nwithin a few hours before milking; but when fed soon after the cows are\r\nmilked, the volatile oils to which these odors are due will generally\r\ndisappear from the animal’s system before the next morning or evening.\r\n\r\nToo often odors of the second class are assigned to the first, and\r\nthe old cow takes the blame for man’s fault; as milk very readily and\r\nquickly takes up smells and tastes from its surroundings. When the\r\nowner delivers milk to the factory and is told that it “smells bad,” he\r\nforgets that he or his men let it stand in the uncleaned stable to draw\r\nin the “cowy” and worse odors, while the cows were being fed and some\r\nother chores attended to; or that they poured it into pails that lacked\r\na little of perfect sweetness; and he immediately says; “I’ve got to\r\nstop feeding silage.” “The cows ate some cabbage trimmings last night,”\r\nor, “Someone forgot to close the rye-field gate.”\r\n\r\nOdors of these two classes, due to volatile compounds in the milk, are\r\nof most importance in the milk and cream trade, as the faults largely\r\ndisappear in making butter and cheese. Thorough æration is often\r\nhelpful in the removal of such flavors.\r\n\r\nOdors of the third class, except in some very rare cases where the\r\nudder itself is the seat of colonies of bacteria, are not observed in\r\nfreshly-drawn milk. The bacteria, molds and yeasts which cause them\r\nmust have a chance to develop and to set up chemical changes in the\r\nmilk; and this rarely occurs to any great extent within 12 hours from\r\nthe time the milk is drawn. A high temperature, however, is favorable\r\nto growth of these low forms of plant life; so in warm weather milk\r\nfaults are common. In butter-making, and in cheese-making, also,\r\nthe heat often used to ripen the cream and the high temperature at\r\nwhich the milk is held in “setting” and “cooking” the curd, furnish\r\nconditions very favorable to the germs present and they develop with\r\ngreat rapidity. In their growth part of the milk is used for food and\r\nin its breaking down into simpler compounds the aromatic substances\r\nwhich make flavor, good or bad, are formed.\r\n\r\nThe flavor of good milk and cream, then, is an inherent quality due\r\nto the normal constituents of the milk; the flavors of butter, both\r\ngood and bad, except that due to the fat and to odors absorbed by the\r\nmilk, are held to be the result of bacterial action; the fundamental\r\nflavors of cheese are probably due to chemical decomposition, started\r\nby unorganized ferments known as enzyms; joined with which are other\r\nflavors marking the individual cheeses, which are probably due to\r\nbacteria; and it has recently been found that in some cases yeasts have\r\nbeen the cause of bad flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISHY FLAVOR IN MILK.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: =Ready Relief.=]\r\n\r\nThis peculiar smell, as though the milk had set in a close room with\r\na barrel of not-too-fresh fish, was brought to the attention of the\r\nBacteriologist by a dealer who had already located it as coming from\r\nthe milk of a certain dairy. The dairyman is a more than ordinarily\r\ncareful milk-handler, who gladly coöperated with the Station in efforts\r\nto locate the trouble in his herd. Bottles were supplied by the\r\nBacteriologist, which had been steamed to insure the death of all germ\r\nlife and then sealed. These sealed bottles were taken by the dairyman\r\nto his farm; at milking time each was opened long enough to receive a\r\nlittle milk from each quarter of the udder of a single cow; and then\r\nre-sealed. All were brought to the Station; and, upon examination, the\r\nodor was found only in the milk of one cow. The owner rejected her milk\r\nand heard no further complaint, from the dealer, of bad smells. This\r\nwas the practical point; and it was thus easily and simply gained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: =Cause not found.=]\r\n\r\nFrom the scientist’s standpoint, though, only a beginning had been\r\nmade; the real cause of the trouble was as yet unknown; nor was any\r\nsatisfactory solution reached even after a long investigation. The\r\nflavor could hardly come from the food, for all the cows were fed alike\r\nand no objectionable weeds were found in their pasture. The cow seemed\r\nperfectly healthy and no evidence of inflammation or disease could be\r\nfound on the udder or in the milk. Neither could any form of bacteria\r\nbe found in the milk, which, in cultures or introduced into the udder\r\nof a healthy cow, would reproduce the fishy smell.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: =Rare fault.=]\r\n\r\nAt least two other cases of similar flavor have been known; but no\r\ncause was evident in either case. The trouble is very infrequent, at\r\nworst, and is here discussed mainly to show how easily a trouble due to\r\none cow can be located by taking individual samples of the milk; and\r\nhow cheaply gotten rid of by leaving out the objectionable product.\r\n\r\n\r\nBITTER FLAVOR IN NEUFCHATEL CHEESE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: =An uncompleted study.=]\r\n\r\nA little better result than that in the study of fishy flavor was\r\nreached in the investigation of a bitter flavor in Neufchatel cheese;\r\nbut this study also had to be left incomplete. The trouble in the\r\nfactory was easily remedied; and the germ responsible for the outbreak\r\nwas obtained in pure culture; but full study of the fault in all its\r\nbearings was hindered by the refusal of the herd owner to admit that\r\nthe trouble was due to his milk. The investigation had to stop with the\r\nguilty herd; it did not locate the original source of infection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: =Method of detection.=]\r\n\r\nThis bitter flavor is not the same as the bitterness quite common in\r\nmilk and cream at certain seasons of the year; as the milk itself\r\ntasted and smelled all right until well along in the process of\r\ncheese-making when the curd was being ærated and drained. The flavor\r\nwas noticed in the factory in October and could not be checked, though\r\nthe maker took great pains to wash and scald all his utensils and\r\neverything which touched the milk after it came from the farm. To\r\nlocate the trouble, samples were taken of the milk of each patron\r\nand the cheese-making process started with each sample. In 18 hours\r\nall the samples of curd appeared normal but two, which were gassy\r\nand bad-smelling; and one of these, when drained and exposed to the\r\nair, showed a pronounced bitter flavor. This sample proved to be from\r\nthe dairy which had furnished the milk for making the Neufchatel,\r\na milk specially selected because of its high fat-content. This\r\nfurnished direct proof that the fault lay in the milk, not in its\r\nfactory handling; and rejection of this milk ended the trouble in the\r\nNeufchatel. As already stated, the study could not be carried into the\r\nherd to see whether one cow, wrong stable surroundings, a stagnant pool\r\nof water or contaminated dairy utensils were to blame for the trouble\r\nin the factory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: =Bacteria blamable.=]\r\n\r\nSamples of this faulty milk were taken for laboratory study and various\r\nbacteria and molds were separated. This was done by diluting the milk\r\nwith a sterilized fluid so that the germs were quite widely separated\r\nwhen the milk was poured out in flat glass dishes. Each kind of germ\r\nis marked by some peculiarity of growth which makes it possible to\r\ndistinguish between them; and pure cultures can be made by transferring\r\na little of the growing colony to a new dish of sterilized agar,\r\ngelatin or other material suited to germ life. From these pure cultures\r\nfresh milk from the Station herd was inoculated and small Neufchatel\r\ncheeses made. No bitter flavor was noticed in similar check cheeses;\r\nand the milk containing only one of the forms of germ life found\r\nproduced bitter cheese. The bitterness, as in the factory, was noticed\r\nonly after the curd was drained and ærated. Soft, poorly-drained curd\r\nwas free from the flavor though well inoculated with the short bacillus\r\nwhich produced the bad flavor in well-dried curd. This shows that the\r\ngerm is one which requires exposure to the air to develop the bitter\r\ncompound in the cheese. Unfortunately this germ, when cultivated in\r\nmilk for some time lost the power of producing bitter cheese, so the\r\ninvestigation came to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET FLAVOR IN CHEDDAR CHEESE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: =A new cause of cheese faults.=]\r\n\r\nBy methods similar to those just given the cause of the common and\r\ncostly cheese fault known as “sweet flavor” has probably been found.\r\nThis investigation was demanded by the occurrence in some of the\r\nbest-conducted factories of outbreaks of the trouble which most\r\nthorough cleansing and scalding fail to overcome. It is believed that\r\nthese attacks result in annual loss to the State of at least $10,000.\r\nThe trouble is of obscure origin and is peculiar in its development,\r\nmanifesting itself in flavors of varying intensity and character, from\r\na faint sweetness to a well-marked fruity smell and taste, and seeming\r\nto appear and disappear without rule or method. This made study more\r\ndifficult than in the case of well-defined troubles; but its manner of\r\ndevelopment in the cheese indicated some living germ as the cause; so\r\nthe attempt at solution of the problem was made from that standpoint.\r\n\r\nBy cultural methods, study was made of the flora of good and poor\r\ncheeses; that is, the various forms of plant life existing in these\r\ncheeses were separated from each other and their forms, actions and\r\neffects noted. These forms of life were mostly bacteria and yeasts;\r\nand, contrary to the usual rule, it was the latter which finally seemed\r\nto demand attention.\r\n\r\nYeasts are plants a little higher in the scale of life than bacteria,\r\na little larger but still microscopic, and differing from bacteria in\r\ntheir mode of reproduction, which is by budding of a new cell from\r\nan old one rather than by division of an old cell into two new ones\r\nof equal size. Their most characteristic action is the formation of\r\nalcohol and carbon dioxide; which makes them indispensable in brewing\r\nand bread making.\r\n\r\nIn good cheeses almost no yeasts were found, but in the sweet-flavored\r\ncheeses sometimes half of the germs present were yeasts; and they were\r\nalways found where the sweet flavor was noticed. Yeasts have not been\r\nrecognized, hitherto, as a cause for such cheese faults; but their\r\npresence in such numbers cast strong suspicion upon them; which actual\r\nwork proved to be well founded, for pronounced cases of sweet flavor\r\ndeveloped in cheeses made from pure milk inoculated with the yeasts;\r\nand the vat in which the cheese was made became contaminated so that,\r\nwithout further intentional inoculation, sweet-flavored cheese was\r\nproduced where none had been known before. As yeasts have hitherto\r\nplayed minor parts in dairy investigations, no classification of those\r\nfound has yet been made, nor has the exact flavor due to each one been\r\ndetermined. Further study is being given to the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSTY SPOT IN CHEDDAR CHEESE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: =Not a flavor.=]\r\n\r\nRusty spot is not a flavor trouble, as spotted cheeses of this kind\r\nmay be all right in taste and smell. The spots, however, are offensive\r\nto the eye and render the cheese salable only at a reduction in price,\r\nif at all. From the Station investigations, continued for nearly two\r\nyears, along much the same lines as the flavor studies but with a\r\nlittle more definite guide in color than in taste and smell, some\r\ndirect knowledge has been gained, though not as definite as could be\r\ndesired along preventive and remedial lines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: =Cause and conditions.=]\r\n\r\nThe rusty spots are colonies of minute plants, bacteria, growing on\r\nthe walls of the air spaces within the cheese. The trouble usually\r\nappears in May, often does little harm during the middle of the summer\r\nand generally disappears in October. In cheese made with a high acid\r\ncontent the moisture content of the air spaces within the cheese is\r\nlow, and without abundance of moisture the germs make little growth;\r\nhence the spots are too small to be noticed. The marked influence, on\r\nthe germs of rusty spot, of this slight variation in the character\r\nof the cheese probably accounts for the unexpected appearance and\r\ndisappearance of the spots from cheeses of an occasional day’s make in\r\ninfected factories.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: =Cure.=]\r\n\r\nWhere the spots are not too large or too plentiful, giving the cheese a\r\ngood high color covers up the rustiness so that it is not noticeable.\r\nTo get entirely rid of the trouble has bothered some of the best\r\ncheese-makers, aided by good advisers; but plenty of hot water followed\r\nby a liberal use of live steam on vats, cans and working utensils\r\nshould give good results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[A] Connected with Fertilizer Control.\r\n\r\n[B] At Second Judicial Department Branch Station, Jamaica, N.
