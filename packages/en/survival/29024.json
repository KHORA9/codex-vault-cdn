APPLETON AND COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS BOOK IS AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED TO\r\n\r\nDr. J. A. ALLEN\r\n\r\nWHO, THROUGH HIS PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE, UNSELFISH DEVOTION TO SCIENCE, AND\r\nNEVER-FAILING SYMPATHY WITH YOUNGER STUDENTS OF ZOÖLOGY HAS BEEN AN\r\nEXAMPLE AND AN INSPIRATION DURING THE YEARS I HAVE WORKED AT HIS SIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring 1916-1917 the First Asiatic Expedition of the American Museum of\r\nNatural History carried on zoölogical explorations along the frontiers\r\nof Tibet and Burma in the little known province of Yün-nan, China.\r\nThe narrative of that expedition has already been given to the public\r\nin the first boot of this series \"Camps and Trails in China.\" It was\r\nalways the intention of the American Museum to continue the Asiatic\r\ninvestigations, and my presence in China on other work in 1918 gave the\r\ndesired opportunity at the conclusion of the war.\r\n\r\nHaving made extensive collections along the southeastern edge of the\r\ngreat central Asian plateau, it was especially desirable to obtain a\r\nrepresentation of the fauna from the northeastern part in preparation\r\nfor the great expedition which, I am glad to say, is now in course of\r\npreparation, and which will conduct work in various other branches of\r\nscience. Consequently, my wife and I spent one of the most delightful\r\nyears of our lives in Mongolia and North China on the Second Asiatic\r\nExpedition of the American Museum of Natural History.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present book is the narrative of our work and travels. As in\r\n\"Camps and Trails\" I have written it entirely from the sportsman's\r\nstandpoint and have purposely avoided scientific details which would\r\nprove uninteresting or wearisome to the general public. Full reports\r\nof the expedition's results will appear in due course in the Museum's\r\nscientific publications and to them I would refer those readers who\r\nwish further details of the Mongolian fauna.\r\n\r\nAsia is the most fascinating hunting ground in all the world, not\r\nbecause of the _quantity_ of game to be found there but because of\r\nits _quality_, and scientific importance. Central Asia was the point\r\nof origin and distribution for many mammals which inhabit other parts\r\nof the earth to-day and the habits and relationships of some of its\r\nbig game animals are almost unknown. Because of unceasing native\r\npersecution, lack of protection, the continued destruction of forests\r\nand the ever increasing facilities for transportation to the remote\r\ndistricts of the interior, many of China's most interesting and\r\nimportant forms of wild life are doomed to extermination in the very\r\nnear future.\r\n\r\nFortunately world museums are awakening to the necessity of obtaining\r\nrepresentative series of Asiatic mammals before it is too late, and\r\nto the broad vision of the President and Board of Trustees of the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History my wife and I owe the exceptional\r\nopportunities which have been given us to carry on zoölogical\r\nexplorations in Asia.\r\n\r\nWe are especially grateful to President Henry Fairfield Osborn, who\r\nis ready, always, to support enthusiastically any plans which tend to\r\nincrease knowledge of China or to strengthen cordial relations between\r\nthe United States and the Chinese Republic.\r\n\r\nDirector F. A. Lucas and Assistant Secretary George H. Sherwood have\r\nnever failed in their attention to the needs of our expeditions when in\r\nthe field and to them I extend our best thanks.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Charles L. Bernheimer, who have contributed to every\r\nexpedition in which I have taken part, generously rendered financial\r\naid for the Mongolian work.\r\n\r\nMy wife, who is ever my best assistant in the field, was responsible\r\nfor all the photographic work of the expedition and I have drawn much\r\nupon her daily \"Journals\" in the preparation of this book.\r\n\r\nI wish to acknowledge the kindness of the Editors of _Harper's\r\nMagazine_, _Natural History_, _Asia Magazine_ and the _Trans-Pacific\r\nMagazine_ in whose publications parts of this book have already\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to a host of friends who gave assistance to the\r\nexpedition and to us personally in the field:\r\n\r\nThe Wai Chiao Pu (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) freely granted permits\r\nfor the expedition to travel throughout China and extended other\r\ncourtesies for which I wish to express appreciation on behalf of the\r\nPresident and Board of Trustees of the American Museum of Natural\r\nHistory.\r\n\r\nIn Peking, His Excellency Paul S. Reinsch, formerly American Minister\r\nto China, Dr. C. D. Tenney, Mr. Willys Peck, Mr. Ernest B. Price\r\nand other members of the Legation staff obtained import permits and\r\nattended to many details connected with the Chinese Government.\r\n\r\nMr. A. M. Guptil acted as our Peking representative while we were in\r\nthe field and assumed much annoying detail in forwarding and receiving\r\nshipments of supplies and equipment. Other gentlemen in Peking who\r\nrendered us courtesies in various ways are Commanders I. V. Gillis and\r\nC. T. Hutchins, Dr. George D. Wilder, Dr. J. G. Anderson and Messrs. H.\r\nC. Faxon, E. G. Smith, C. R. Bennett, M. E. Weatherall and J. Kenrick.\r\n\r\nIn Kalgan, Mr. Charles L. Coltman arranged for the transportation of\r\nthe expedition to Mongolia and not only gratuitously acted as our agent\r\nbut was always ready to devote his own time and the use of his motor\r\ncars to further the work of the party.\r\n\r\nIn Urga, Mr. F. A. Larsen of Anderson, Meyer & Company, was of\r\ninvaluable assistance in obtaining horses, carts and other equipment\r\nfor the expedition as well as in giving us the benefit of his long and\r\nunique experience in Mongolia.\r\n\r\nMr. E. V. Olufsen of Anderson, Meyer & Company, put himself, his\r\nhouse, and his servants at our disposal whenever we were in Urga and\r\naided us in innumerable ways.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Oscar Mamen often entertained us in their home. Mr. and\r\nMrs. E. L. MacCallie, who accompanied us on one trip across Mongolia\r\nand later resided temporarily in Urga, brought equipment for us across\r\nMongolia and entertained us while we were preparing to return to Peking.\r\n\r\nMonsieur A. Orlow, Russian Diplomatic Agent in Urga, obtained permits\r\nfrom the Mongolian Government for our work in the Urga region and gave\r\nus much valuable advice.\r\n\r\nIn south China, Reverend H. Castle of Tunglu, and Reverend Lacy Moffet\r\nplanned a delightful hunting trip for us in Che-kiang Province.\r\n\r\nIn Shanghai the Hon. E. S. Cunningham, American Consul-General,\r\nmaterially aided the expedition in the shipment of specimens. To Mr.\r\nG. M. Jackson, General Passenger Agent of the Canadian Pacific Ocean\r\nServices, thanks are due for arranging for rapid transportation to\r\nAmerica of our valuable collections.\r\n\r\n                                           Roy Chapman Andrews\r\n\r\n   American Museum of\r\n    Natural History,\r\n  New York City, U.

The\r\npresent status of the country, however, is but little known to the\r\nwestern world. In a few words I will endeavor to sketch the recent\r\npolitical developments, some of which occurred while we were in\r\nMongolia.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the great Genghiz Khan and\r\nhis illustrious successor Kublai Khan \"almost in a night\" erected the\r\ngreatest empire the world has ever seen. Not only did they conquer all\r\nof Asia, but they advanced in Europe as far as the Dnieper leaving\r\nbehind a trail of blood and slaughter.\r\n\r\nAll Europe rose against them, but what could not be accomplished by\r\nforce of arms was wrought in the Mongols themselves by an excess of\r\nluxury. In their victorious advance great stores of treasure fell into\r\ntheir hands and they gave themselves to a life of ease and indulgence.\r\n\r\nBy nature the Mongols were hard riding, hard living warriors,\r\naccustomed to privation and fatigue. The poison of luxury ate into the\r\nvery fibers of their being and gradually they lost the characteristics\r\nwhich had made them great. The ruin of the race was completed by\r\nthe introduction of Lamaism, a religion which carries only moral\r\ndestruction where it enters, and eventually the Mongols passed under\r\nthe rule of the once conquered Chinese and then under the Manchus.\r\n\r\nUntil the overthrow of the Manchu regime in China in 1911, and the\r\nestablishment of the present republic, there were no particularly\r\nsignificant events in Mongolian history. But at that time the Russians,\r\nwishing to create a buffer state between themselves and China as well\r\nas to obtain special commercial privileges in Mongolia, aided the\r\nMongols in rebellion, furnished them with arms and ammunition and with\r\nofficers to train their men.\r\n\r\nA somewhat tentative proclamation of independence for Outer Mongolia\r\nwas issued in December, 1911, by the Hutukhtu and nobles of Urga, and\r\nthe Chinese were driven out of the country with little difficulty.\r\nBeset with internal troubles, the Chinese paid but scant attention\r\nto Mongolian affairs until news was received in Peking in October,\r\n1912, that M. Korostovetz, formerly Russian Minister to China, had\r\narrived secretly in Urga and on November 3, 1912, had recognized the\r\nindependence of Outer Mongolia on behalf of his Government.\r\n\r\nIt then became incumbent upon China to take official note of the\r\nsituation, especially as foreign complications could not be faced in\r\nview of her domestic embarrassments.\r\n\r\nConsequently on November 5, 1913, there was concluded a Russo-Chinese\r\nagreement wherein Russia recognized that Outer Mongolia was under the\r\nsuzerainty of China, and China, on her part, admitted the autonomy of\r\nOuter Mongolia. The essential element in the situation was the fact\r\nthat Russia stood behind the Mongols with money and arms and China's\r\nhand was forced at a time when she was powerless to resist.\r\n\r\nQuite naturally, Mongolia's political status has been a sore point\r\nwith China and it is hardly surprising that she should have awaited an\r\nopportunity to reclaim what she considered to be her own.\r\n\r\nThis opportunity arrived with the collapse of Russia and the spread of\r\nBolshevism, for the Mongols were dependent upon Russia for material\r\nassistance in anything resembling military operations, although, as\r\nearly as 1914, they had begun to realize that they were cultivating a\r\ndangerous friend. The Mongolian army, at the most, numbered only two\r\nor three thousand poorly equipped and undisciplined troops who would\r\nrequire money and organization before they could become an effective\r\nfighting force.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese were not slow to appreciate these conditions and General\r\nHsu Shu-tseng, popularly known as \"Little Hsu,\" by a clever bit of\r\nOriental intrigue sent four thousand soldiers to Urga with the excuse\r\nof protecting the Mongols from a so-called threatened invasion of\r\nBuriats and brigands. A little later he himself arrived in a motor car\r\nand, when the stage was set, brought such pressure to bear upon the\r\nHutukhtu and his Cabinet that they had no recourse except to cancel\r\nMongolia's autonomy and ask to return to their former place under\r\nChinese rule.\r\n\r\nThis they did on November 17, 1919, in a formal Memorial addressed to\r\nthe President of the Chinese Republic, which is quoted below as it\r\nappeared in the Peking press, under date of November 24, 1919:\r\n\r\n\"We, the Ministers and Vice-Ministers [here follow their names and\r\nranks] of all the departments of the autonomous Government of Outer\r\nMongolia, and all the princes, dukes, hutukhtus and lamas and others\r\nresident at Urga, hereby jointly and severally submit the following\r\npetition for the esteemed perusal of His Excellency the President of\r\nthe Republic of China:--\r\n\r\n\"Outer Mongolia has been a dependency of China since the reign of the\r\nEmperor Kang Hsi, remaining loyal for over two hundred years, the\r\nentire population, from princes and dukes down to the common people\r\nhaving enjoyed the blessings of peace. During the reign of the Emperor\r\nTao Kwang changes in the established institutions, which were opposed\r\nto Mongolian sentiment, caused dissatisfaction which was aggravated\r\nby the corruption of the administration during the last days of the\r\nManchu Dynasty. Taking advantage of this Mongolian dissatisfaction,\r\nforeigners instigated and assisted the independence movement. Upon the\r\nKiakhta Convention, being signed the autonomy of Outer Mongolia was\r\nheld a _fait accompli_, China retaining an empty suzerainty while the\r\nofficials and people of Outer Mongolia lost many of their old rights\r\nand privileges. Since the establishment of this autonomous government\r\nno progress whatsoever has been chronicled, the affairs of government\r\nbeing indeed plunged in a state of chaos, causing deep pessimism.\r\n\r\n\"Lately, chaotic conditions have also reigned supreme in Russia,\r\nreports of revolutionary elements threatening our frontiers having\r\nbeen frequently received. Moreover, since the Russians have no united\r\ngovernment it is only natural that they are powerless to carry out\r\nthe provisions of the treaties, and now that they have no control\r\nover their subjects the Buriat tribes have constantly conspired and\r\ncooperated with bandits, and repeatedly sent delegates to Urga urging\r\nour Government to join with them and form a Pan-Mongolian nation.\r\nThat this propaganda work, so varied and so persistent, which aims\r\nat usurping Chinese suzerainty and undermining the autonomy of Outer\r\nMongolia, does more harm than good to Outer Mongolia, our Government\r\nis well aware. The Buriats, with their bandit Allies, now considering\r\nus unwilling to espouse their cause, contemplate dispatching troops to\r\nviolate our frontiers and to compel our submission. Furthermore, forces\r\nfrom the so-called White Army have forcibly occupied Tanu Ulianghai,\r\nan old possession of Outer Mongolia, and attacked both Chinese and\r\nMongolian troops, this being followed by the entry of the Red Army,\r\nthus making the situation impossible.\r\n\r\n\"Now that both our internal and external affairs have reached such\r\na climax, we, the members of the Government, in view of the present\r\nsituation, have assembled all the princes, dukes, lamas and others\r\nand have held frequent meetings to discuss the question of our future\r\nwelfare. Those present have been unanimously of the opinion that the\r\nold bonds of friendship having been restored our autonomy should be\r\ncanceled, since Chinese and Mongolians are filled with a common purpose\r\nand ideal.\r\n\r\n\"The result of our decision has been duly reported to His Holiness\r\nthe Bogdo Jetsun Dampa Hutukhtu Khan and has received his approval\r\nand support. Such being the position we now unanimously petition His\r\nExcellency the President that the old order of affairs be restored.\"\r\n\r\n(Signed)\r\n\r\n  \"Premier and Acting Minister of the Interior, Prince Lama\r\n     Batma Torgoo.\r\n   Vice-Minister, Prince of Tarkhan Puntzuk Cheilin.\r\n   Vice-Minister, Great Lama of Beliktu, Prince Puntzuk\r\n     Torgoo.\r\n   Minister of Foreign Affairs, Duke Cheilin Torgoo.\r\n   Vice-Minister, Dalai Prince Cheitantnun Lomour.\r\n   Vice-Minister, Prince of Ochi, Kaotzuktanba.\r\n   Minister of War, Prince of Eltoni Jamuyen Torgoo.\r\n   Vice-Minister, Prince of Eltoni Selunto Chihloh.\r\n   Vice-Minister, Prince of Elteni Punktzu Laptan.\r\n   Vice-Minister, Prince of Itkemur Chitu Wachir.\r\n   Minister of Finance, Prince Lama Loobitsan Paletan.\r\n   Vice-Minister, Prince Torgee Cheilin.\r\n   Vice-Minister, Prince of Suchuketu Tehmutgu Kejwan.\r\n   Minister of Justice, Dalai of Chiechenkhan Wananin.\r\n   Vice-Minister, Prince of Daichinchihlun Chackehbatehorhu.\r\n   Vice-Minister, Prince of Cholikota Lama Dashtunyupu,\"\r\n\r\nNaturally, the President of China graciously consented to allow the\r\nprodigal to return and \"killed the fatted calf\" by conferring high\r\nhonors and titles upon the Hutukhtu. Moreover, he appointed the Living\r\nBuddha's good friend (?) \"Little Hsu\" to convey them to him.\r\n\r\nThus, Mongolia again has become a part of China. Who knows what the\r\nfuture has in store for her? But events are moving rapidly and by the\r\ntime this book is published the curtain may have risen upon a new act\r\nof Mongolia's tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACROSS\r\n\r\nMONGOLIAN PLAINS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nENTERING THE LAND OF MYSTERY\r\n\r\n\r\nCareering madly in a motor car behind a herd of antelope fleeing like\r\nwind-blown ribbons across a desert which isn't a desert, past caravans\r\nof camels led by picturesque Mongol horsemen, the Twentieth Century\r\nsuddenly and violently interjected into the Middle Ages, should be\r\ncontrast and paradox enough for even the most blase sportsman. I am\r\na naturalist who has wandered into many of the far corners of the\r\nearth. I have seen strange men and things, but what I saw on the great\r\nMongolian plateau fairly took my breath away and left me dazed, utterly\r\nunable to adjust my mental perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen leaving Peking in late August, 1918, to cross the Gobi Desert in\r\nMongolia, I knew that I was to go by motor car. But somehow the very\r\nnames \"Mongolia\" and \"Gobi Desert\" brought such a vivid picture of the\r\ndays of Kublai Khan and ancient Cathay that my clouded mind refused to\r\nadmit the thought of automobiles. It was enough that I was going to the\r\nland of which I had so often dreamed.\r\n\r\nNot even in the railway, when I was being borne toward Kalgan and saw\r\nlines of laden camels plodding silently along the paved road beside\r\nthe train, or when we puffed slowly through the famous Nankou Pass and\r\nI saw that wonder of the world, the Great Wall, winding like a gray\r\nserpent over ridge after ridge of the mountains, was my dream-picture\r\nof mysterious Mongolia dispelled. I had seen all this before, and had\r\naccepted it as one accepts the motor cars beside the splendid walls of\r\nold Peking. It was too near, and the railroad had made it commonplace.\r\n\r\nBut Mongolia! That was different. One could not go there in a roaring\r\ntrain. I had beside me the same old rifle and sleeping bag that had\r\nbeen carried across the mountains of far Yün-nan, along the Tibetan\r\nfrontier, and through the fever-stricken jungles of Burma. Somehow,\r\nthese companions of forest and mountain trails, and my reception at\r\nKalgan by two khaki-clad young men, each with a belt of cartridges\r\nand a six-shooter strapped about his waist, did much to keep me\r\nin a blissful state of unpreparedness for the destruction of my\r\ndream-castles.\r\n\r\nThat night as we sat in Mr. Charles Coltman's home, with his charming\r\nwife, a real woman of the great outdoors, presiding at the dinner\r\ntable, the talk was all of shooting, horses, and the vast, lone spaces\r\nof the Gobi Desert--but not much of motor cars. Perhaps they vaguely\r\nrealized that I was still asleep in an unreal world and knew that the\r\nawakening would come all too soon.\r\n\r\nYet I was dining that night with one of the men who had destroyed the\r\nmystery of Mongolia. In 1916, Coltman and his former partner, Oscar\r\nMamen, had driven across the plains to Urga, the historic capital of\r\nMongolia. But most unromantic and incongruous, most disheartening to a\r\ndreamer of Oriental dreams, was what I learned a few days later when\r\nthe awakening had really come--that among the first cars ever to cross\r\nthe desert was one purchased by the Hutukhtu, the Living Buddha, the\r\nGod of all the Mongols.\r\n\r\nWhen the Hutukhtu learned of the first motor car in Mongolia he\r\nforthwith demanded one for himself. So his automobile was brought\r\nsafely through the rocky pass at Kalgan and across the seven hundred\r\nmiles of plain to Urga by way of the same old caravan trail over which,\r\ncenturies ago, Genghis Khan had sent his wild Mongol raiders to conquer\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nWe arose long before daylight on the morning of August 29. In the\r\ncourtyard lanterns flashed and disappeared like giant fireflies as the\r\n_mafus_ (muleteers) packed the baggage and saddled the ponies. The cars\r\nhad been left on the plateau at a mission station called Hei-ma-hou\r\nto avoid the rough going in the pass, and we were to ride there on\r\nhorseback while the food and bed-rolls went by cart. There were five\r\nof us in the party--Mr. and Mrs. Coltman, Mr. and Mrs. Lucander, and\r\nmyself. I was on a reconnaissance and Mr. Coltman's object was to visit\r\nhis trading station in Urga, where the Lucanders were to remain for the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe sun was an hour high when we clattered over the slippery paving\r\nstones to the north gate of the city. Kalgan is built hard against the\r\nGreat Wall of China--the first line of defense, the outermost rampart\r\nin the colossal structure which for so many centuries protected China\r\nfrom Tartar invasion. Beyond it there was nothing between us and the\r\ngreat plateau.\r\n\r\nAfter our passports had been examined we rode through the gloomy\r\nchasm-like gate, turned sharply to the left, and found ourselves\r\nstanding on the edge of a half-dry river bed. Below us stretched line\r\nafter line of double-humped camels, some crowded in yellow-brown masses\r\nwhich seemed all heads and curving necks, and some kneeling quietly on\r\nthe sand. From around a shoulder of rock came other camels, hundreds\r\nof them, treading slowly and sedately, nose to tail, toward the gate\r\nin the Great Wall. They had come from the far country whither we were\r\nbound. To me there is something fascinating about a camel. Perhaps it\r\nis because he seems to typify the great waste spaces which I love,\r\nthat I never tire of watching him swing silently, and seemingly with\r\nresistless power, across the desert.\r\n\r\nOur way to Hei-ma-hou led up the dry river bed, with the Great Wall\r\non the left stretching its serpentine length across the hills, and\r\non the right picturesque cliffs two hundred feet in height. At their\r\nbases nestle mud-roofed cottages and Chinese inns, but farther up the\r\nriver the low hills are all of _loess_--brown, wind-blown dust, packed\r\nhard, which can be cut like cheese. Deserted though they seem from a\r\ndistance, they really teem with human life. Whole villages are half\r\ndug, half built, into the hillsides, but are well-nigh invisible, for\r\nevery wall and roof is of the same brown earth.\r\n\r\nTen miles or so from Kalgan we began on foot the long climb up the pass\r\nwhich gives entrance to the great plateau. I kept my eyes steadily on\r\nthe pony's heels until we reached a broad, flat terrace halfway up the\r\npass. Then I swung about that I might have, all at once, the view which\r\nlay below us. It justified my greatest hopes, for miles and miles of\r\nrolling hills stretched away to where the far horizon met the Shansi\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nIt was a desolate country which I saw, for every wave in this vast\r\nland-sea was cut and slashed by the knives of wind and frost and rain,\r\nand lay in a chaotic mass of gaping wounds--cañons, ravines, and\r\ngullies, painted in rainbow colors, crossing and cutting one another at\r\nfantastic angles as far as the eye could see.\r\n\r\nWhen, a few moments later, we reached the very summit of the pass,\r\nI felt that no spot I had ever visited satisfied my preconceived\r\nconceptions quite so thoroughly. Behind and below us lay that\r\nstupendous relief map of ravines and gorges; in front was a limitless\r\nstretch of undulating plain, I knew then that I really stood upon the\r\nedge of the greatest plateau in all the world and that it could be only\r\nMongolia.\r\n\r\nWe had tiffin at a tiny Chinese inn beside the road, and trotted on\r\ntoward Hei-ma-hou between waving fields of wheat, buckwheat, millet,\r\nand oats--oats as thick and \"meaty\" as any horse could wish to eat.\r\n\r\nAfter tiffin Coltman and Lucander rode rapidly ahead while I trotted\r\nmy pony along more slowly in the rear. It was nearly seven o'clock,\r\nand the trees about the mission station had been visible for half an\r\nhour. I was enjoying a gorgeous sunset which splashed the western sky\r\nwith gold and red, and lazily watching the black silhouettes of a\r\ncamel caravan swinging along the summit of a ridge a mile away. On the\r\nroad beside me a train of laden mules and bullock-carts rested for a\r\nmoment--the drivers half asleep. Over all the plain there lay the peace\r\nof a perfect autumn evening.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, from behind a little rise, I heard the whir of a motor\r\nengine and the raucous voice of a Klaxon horn. Before I realized what\r\nit meant, I was in the midst of a mass of plunging, snorting animals,\r\nshouting carters, and kicking mules. In a moment the caravan scattered\r\nwildly across the plain and the road was clear save for the author of\r\nthe turmoil--a black automobile.\r\n\r\nI wish I could make those who spend their lives within a city know\r\nhow strange and out of place that motor seemed, alone there upon the\r\nopen plain on the borders of Mongolia. Imagine a camel or an elephant\r\nwith all its Oriental trappings suddenly appearing on Fifth Avenue!\r\nYou would think at once that it had escaped from a circus or a zoo and\r\nwould be mainly curious as to what the traffic policeman would do when\r\nit did not obey his signals.\r\n\r\nBut all the incongruity and the fact that the automobile was a glaring\r\nanachronism did not prevent my abandoning my horse to the _mafu_ and\r\nstretching out comfortably on the cushions of the rear seat. There I\r\nhad nothing to do but collect the remains of my shattered dream-castles\r\nas we bounced over the ruts and stones. It was a rude awakening, and\r\nI felt half ashamed to admit to myself as the miles sped by that the\r\nspringy seat was more comfortable than the saddle on my Mongol pony.\r\n\r\nBut that night when I strolled about the mission courtyard, under the\r\nspell of the starry, desert sky, I drifted back again in thought to the\r\nglorious days of Kublai Khan. My heart was hot with resentment that\r\nthis thing had come. I realized then that, for better or for worse,\r\nthe sanctity of the desert was gone forever. Camels will still plod\r\ntheir silent way across the age-old plains, but the mystery is lost.\r\nThe secrets which were yielded up to but a chosen few are open now to\r\nall, and the world and his wife will speed their noisy course across\r\nthe miles of rolling prairie, hearing nothing, feeling nothing, knowing\r\nnothing of that resistless desert charm which led men out into the\r\nGreat Unknown.\r\n\r\nAt daylight we packed the cars. Bed-rolls and cans of gasoline were\r\ntied on the running boards and every corner was filled with food. Our\r\nrifles were ready for use, however, for Coltman had promised a kind of\r\nshooting such as I had never seen before. The stories he told of wild\r\nrides in the car after strings of antelope which traveled at fifty or\r\nsixty miles an hour had left me mildly skeptical. But then, you know, I\r\nhad never seen a Mongolian antelope run.\r\n\r\nFor twenty or thirty miles after leaving Hei-ma-hou we bounced along\r\nover a road which would have been splendid except for the deep ruts\r\ncut by mule- and ox-carts. These carts are the despair of any one who\r\nhopes some time to see good roads in China. The spike-studded wheels\r\ncut into the hardest ground and leave a chaos of ridges and chasms\r\nwhich grows worse with every year.\r\n\r\nWe were seldom out of sight of mud-walled huts or tiny Chinese\r\nvillages, and Chinese peddlers passed our cars, carrying baskets of\r\nfruit or trinkets for the women. Chinese farmers stopped to gaze at us\r\nas we bounded over the ruts--in fact it was all Chinese, although we\r\nwere really in Mongolia. I was very eager to see Mongols, to register\r\nfirst impressions of a people of whom I had dreamed so much; but the\r\nblue-clad Chinaman was ubiquitous.\r\n\r\nFor seventy miles from Kalgan it was all the same--Chinese everywhere.\r\nThe Great Wall was built to keep the Mongols out, and by the same token\r\nit should have kept the Chinese in. But the rolling, grassy sea of\r\nthe vast plateau was too strong a temptation for the Chinese farmer.\r\nEncouraged by his own government, which knows the value of just such\r\npeaceful penetration, he pushes forward the line of cultivation a dozen\r\nmiles or so every year. As a result the grassy hills have given place\r\nto fields of wheat, oats, millet, buckwheat, and potatoes.\r\n\r\nPLATE I\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROY CHAPMAN ANDREWS on \"KUBLAI KHAN\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YVETTE BORUP ANDREWS, PHOTOGRAPHER OF THE EXPEDITION]\r\n\r\nThe Mongol, above all things, is not a farmer; possibly because, many\r\nyears ago, the Manchus forbade him to till the soil. Moreover, on\r\nthe ground he is as awkward as a duck out of water and he is never\r\ncomfortable. The back of a pony is his real home, and he will do\r\nwonderfully well any work which keeps him in the saddle. As Mr. F. A.\r\nLarsen in Urga once said, \"A Mongol would make a splendid cook if you\r\ncould give him a horse to ride about on in the kitchen.\" So he leaves\r\nto the plodding Chinaman the cultivation of his boundless plains, while\r\nhe herds his fat-tailed sheep and goats and cattle.\r\n\r\nAbout two hours after leaving the mission station we passed the limit\r\nof cultivation and were riding toward the Tabool hills. There Mr.\r\nLarsen, the best known foreigner in all Mongolia, has a home, and as we\r\nswung past the trail which leads to his house we saw one of his great\r\nherds of horses grazing in the distance.\r\n\r\nAll the land in this region has long, rich grass in summer, and water\r\nis by no means scarce. There are frequent wells and streams along the\r\nroad, and in the distance we often caught a glint of silver from the\r\nsurface of a pond or lake. Flocks of goats and fat-tailed sheep drifted\r\nup the valley, and now and then a herd of cattle massed themselves in\r\nmoving patches on the hillsides. But they are only a fraction of the\r\nnumbers which this land could easily support.\r\n\r\nNot far from Tabool is a Mongol village. I jumped out of the car to\r\ntake a photograph but scrambled in again almost as quickly, for as soon\r\nas the motor had stopped a dozen dogs dashed from the houses snarling\r\nand barking like a pack of wolves. They are huge brutes, these Mongol\r\ndogs, and as fierce as they are big. Every family and every caravan\r\nowns one or more, and we learned very soon never to approach a native\r\nencampment on foot.\r\n\r\nThe village was as unlike a Chinese settlement as it well could be,\r\nfor instead of closely packed mud houses there were circular, latticed\r\nframeworks covered with felt and cone-shaped in the upper half. The\r\n_yurt_, as it is called, is perfectly adapted to the Mongols and their\r\nlife. In the winter a stove is placed in the center, and the house is\r\ndry and warm. In the summer the felt covering is sometimes replaced by\r\ncanvas which can be lifted on any side to allow free passage of air.\r\nWhen it is time for the semiannual migration to new grazing grounds\r\nthe _yurt_ can be quickly dismantled, the framework collapsed, and the\r\nhouse packed on camels or carts.\r\n\r\nThe Mongols of the village were rather disappointing, for many of them\r\nshow a strong element of Chinese blood. This seems to have developed\r\nan unfortunate combination of the worst characteristics of both races.\r\nEven where there is no real mixture, their contact with the Chinese has\r\nbeen demoralizing, and they will rob and steal at every opportunity.\r\nThe headdresses of the southern women are by no means as elaborate as\r\nthose in the north.\r\n\r\nWhen the hills of Tabool had begun to sink on the horizon behind us, we\r\nentered upon a vast rolling plain, where there was but little water and\r\nnot a sign of human life. It resembled nothing so much as the prairies\r\nof Nebraska or Dakota, and amid the short grass larkspur and purple\r\nthistles glowed in the sunlight like tongues of flame.\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of birds. In the ponds which we passed earlier in the\r\nday we saw hundreds of mallard ducks and teal. The car often frightened\r\ngolden plover from their dust baths in the road, and crested lapwings\r\nflashed across the prairie like sudden storms of autumn leaves.\r\nHuge, golden eagles and enormous ravens made tempting targets on the\r\ntelegraph poles, and in the morning before we left the cultivated area\r\nwe saw demoiselle cranes in thousands.\r\n\r\nIn this land where wood is absent and everything that will make a\r\nfire is of value, I wondered how it happened that the telegraph\r\npoles remained untouched, for every one was smooth and round without\r\na splinter gone. The method of protection is simple and entirely\r\nOriental. When the line was first erected, the Mongolian government\r\nstated in an edict that any man who touched a pole with knife or ax\r\nwould lose his head. Even on the plains the enforcement of such a law\r\nis not so difficult as it might seem, and after a few heads had been\r\ntaken by way of example the safety of the line was assured.\r\n\r\nOur camp the first night was on a hill slope about one hundred miles\r\nfrom Hei-ma-hou. As soon as the cars had stopped, one man was left to\r\nuntie the sleeping bags while the rest of us scattered over the plain\r\nto hunt material for a fire. _Argul_ (dried dung) forms the only desert\r\nfuel and, although it does not blaze like wood, it will \"boil a pot\"\r\nalmost as quickly as charcoal. I was elected to be the cook--a position\r\nwith distinct advantages, for in the freezing cold of early morning I\r\ncould linger about the fire with a good excuse.\r\n\r\nIt was a perfect autumn night. Every star in the world of space seemed\r\nto have been crowded into our own particular expanse of sky, and each\r\none glowed like a tiny lantern. When I had found a patch of sand and\r\nhad dug a trench for my hip and shoulder, I crawled into the sleeping\r\nbag and lay for half an hour looking up at the bespangled canopy above\r\nmy head. Again the magic of the desert night was in my blood, and I\r\nblessed the fate which had carried me away from the roar and rush of\r\nNew York with its hurrying crowds. But I felt a pang of envy when, far\r\naway in the distance, there came the mellow notes of a camel-bell.\r\n_Dong, dong, dong_ it sounded, clear and sweet as cathedral chimes.\r\nWith surging blood I listened until I caught the measured tread of\r\npadded feet, and saw the black silhouettes of rounded bodies and\r\ncurving necks. Oh, to be with them, to travel as Marco Polo traveled,\r\nand to learn to know the heart of the desert in the long night marches!\r\nBefore I closed my eyes that night I vowed that when the war was done\r\nand I was free to travel where I willed, I would come again to the\r\ndesert as the great Venetian came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSPEED MARVELS OF THE GOBI DESERT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, ten miles from camp, we passed a party of Russians\r\nen route to Kalgan. They were sitting disconsolately beside two huge\r\ncars, patching tires and tightening bolts. Their way had been marked by\r\na succession of motor troubles and they were almost discouraged. Woe\r\nto the men who venture into the desert with an untried car and without\r\na skilled mechanic! There are no garages just around the corner--and\r\nthere are no corners. Lucander's Chinese boy expressed it with laconic\r\ncompleteness when some one asked him how he liked the country.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"there's plenty of _room_, here.\"\r\n\r\nA short distance farther on we found the caravan which had passed us\r\nearly in the night. They were camped beside a well and the thirsty\r\ncamels were gorging themselves with water. Except for these wells, the\r\nmarch across the desert would be impossible. They are four or five feet\r\nwide, walled with timbers, and partly roofed. In some the water is\r\nrather brackish but always cool, for it is seldom less than ten feet\r\nbelow the surface. It is useless to speculate as to who dug the wells\r\nor when, for this trail has been used for centuries. In some regions\r\nthey are fifty or even sixty miles apart, but usually less than that.\r\n\r\nThe camel caravans travel mostly at night. For all his size and\r\napparent strength, a camel is a delicate animal and needs careful\r\nhandling. He cannot stand the heat of the midday sun and he will not\r\ngraze at night. So the Gobi caravans start about three or four o'clock\r\nin the afternoon and march until one or two the next morning. Then the\r\nmen pitch a light tent and the camels sleep or wander over the plain.\r\n\r\nAt noon on the second day we reached Panj-kiang, the first telegraph\r\nstation on the line. Its single mud house was visible miles away and we\r\nwere glad to see it, for our gasoline was getting low. Coltman had sent\r\na plentiful supply by caravan to await us here, and every available\r\ninch of space was filled with cans, for we were only one-quarter of the\r\nway to Urga.\r\n\r\nNot far beyond Panj-kiang, a lama monastery has been built beside\r\nthe road. Its white-walled temple bordered with red and the compound\r\nenclosing the living quarters of the lamas show with startling\r\ndistinctness on the open plain. We stopped for water at a well a few\r\nhundred yards away, and in five minutes the cars were surrounded by a\r\npicturesque group of lamas who streamed across the plain on foot and\r\non horseback, their yellow and red robes flaming in the sun. They were\r\namiable enough--in fact, too friendly--and their curiosity was hardly\r\nwelcome, for we found one of them testing his knife on the tires and\r\nanother about to punch a hole in one of the gasoline cans; he hoped it\r\nheld something to drink that was better than water.\r\n\r\nThus far the trail had not been bad, as roads go in the Gobi, but I was\r\nassured that the next hundred miles would be a different story, for we\r\nwere about to enter the most arid part of the desert between Kalgan and\r\nUrga. We were prepared for the only real work of the trip, however, by\r\na taste of the exciting shooting which Coltman had promised me.\r\n\r\nI had been told that we should see antelope in thousands, but all day\r\nI had vainly searched the plains for a sign of game. Ten miles from\r\nPanj-kiang we were rolling comfortably along on a stretch of good road\r\nwhen Mrs. Coltman, whose eyes are as keen as those of a hawk, excitedly\r\npointed to a knoll on the right, not a hundred yards from the trail. At\r\nfirst I saw nothing but yellow grass; then the whole hillside seemed to\r\nbe in motion. A moment later I began to distinguish heads and legs and\r\nrealized that I was looking at an enormous herd of antelope, closely\r\npacked together, restlessly watching us.\r\n\r\nOur rifles were out in an instant and Coltman opened the throttle. The\r\nantelope were five or six hundred yards away, and as the car leaped\r\nforward they ranged themselves in single file and strung out across\r\nthe plain. We left the road at once and headed diagonally toward them.\r\nFor some strange reason, when a horse or car runs parallel with a herd\r\nof antelope, the animals will swing in a complete semicircle and cross\r\nin front of the pursuer. This is also true of some African species.\r\nWhether they think they are being cut off from some more desirable\r\nmeans of escape I cannot say, but the fact remains that with the open\r\nplain on every side they always try to \"cross your bows.\"\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the sight of those magnificent animals streaming\r\nacross the desert! There were at least a thousand of them, and their\r\nyellow bodies seemed fairly to skim the earth. I was shouting in\r\nexcitement, but Coltman said:\r\n\r\n\"They're not running yet. Wait till we begin to shoot.\"\r\n\r\nI could hardly believe my eyes when I saw the speedometer trembling at\r\nthirty-five miles, for we were making a poor showing with the antelope.\r\nBut then the fatal attraction began to assert itself and the long\r\ncolumn bent gradually in our direction. Coltman widened the arc of\r\nthe circle and held the throttle up as far as it would go. Our speed\r\nincreased to forty miles and the car began to gain because the antelope\r\nwere running almost across our course.\r\n\r\nThey were about two hundred yards away when Coltman shut off the gas\r\nand jammed both brakes, but before the car had stopped they had gained\r\nanother hundred. I leaped over a pile of bedding and came into action\r\nwith the .250 Savage high-power as soon as my feet were on the ground.\r\nColtman's .30 Mauser was already spitting fire from the front seat\r\nacross the wind-shield, and at his second shot an antelope dropped like\r\nlead. My first two bullets struck the dirt far behind the rearmost\r\nanimal, but the third caught a full-grown female in the side and she\r\nplunged forward into the grass.\r\n\r\nI realized then what Coltman meant when he said that the antelope had\r\nnot begun to run. At the first shot every animal in the herd seemed\r\nto flatten itself and settle to its work. They did not run--they\r\nsimply _flew_ across the ground, their legs showing only as a blur.\r\nThe one I killed was four hundred yards away, and I held four feet\r\nahead when I pulled the trigger. They could not have been traveling\r\nless than fifty-five or sixty miles an hour, for they were running in\r\na semicircle about the car while we were moving at forty miles in a\r\nstraight line.\r\n\r\nThose are the facts in the case. I can see my readers raise their brows\r\nincredulously, for that is exactly what I would have done before this\r\ndemonstration. Well, there is one way to prove it and that is to come\r\nand try it for yourselves. Moreover, I can see some sportsmen smile for\r\nanother reason. I mentioned that the antelope I killed was four hundred\r\nyards away. I know how far it was, for I paced it off. I may say, in\r\npassing, that I had never before killed a running animal at that range.\r\nNinety per cent of my shooting had been well within one hundred and\r\nfifty yards, but in Mongolia conditions are most extraordinary.\r\n\r\nIn the brilliant atmosphere an antelope at four hundred yards appears\r\nas large as it would at one hundred in most other parts of the world;\r\nand on the flat plains, where there is not a bush or a shrub to obscure\r\nthe view, a tiny stone stands out like a golf ball on the putting\r\ngreen. Because of these conditions there is strong temptation to shoot\r\nat impossible ranges and to keep on shooting when the game is beyond\r\nanything except a lucky chance. Therefore, if any of you go to Mongolia\r\nto hunt antelope take plenty of ammunition, and when you return you\r\nwill never tell how many cartridges you used. Our antelope were tied\r\non the running board of the car and we went back to the road where\r\nLucander was waiting. Half the herd had crossed in front of him, but he\r\nhad failed to bring down an animal.\r\n\r\nWhen the excitement was over I began to understand the significance\r\nof what we had seen. It was slowly borne in upon me that our car had\r\nbeen going, by the speedometer, at forty miles an hour and that the\r\n_antelope were actually beating us_. It was an amazing discovery, for\r\nI had never dreamed that any living animal could run so fast. It was a\r\ndiscovery, too, which would have important results, for Professor Henry\r\nFairfield Osborn, president of the American Museum of Natural History,\r\neven then was carrying on investigations as to the relation of speed\r\nto limb structure in various groups of animals. I determined, with Mr.\r\nColtman's help, to get some real facts in the case--data upon which we\r\ncould rely.\r\n\r\nThere was an opportunity only to begin the study on the first trip,\r\nbut we carried it further the following year. Time after time, as we\r\ntore madly after antelope, singly or in herds, I kept my eyes upon the\r\nspeedometer, and I feel confident that our observations can be relied\r\nupon. We demonstrated beyond a doubt that the Mongolian antelope can\r\nreach a speed of from fifty-five to sixty miles an hour. This is\r\nprobably the maximum _which is attained only in the initial sprint_ and\r\nafter a very short distance the animals must slow down to about forty\r\nmiles; a short distance more and they drop to twenty-five or thirty\r\nmiles, and at this pace they seem able to continue almost indefinitely.\r\nThey never ran faster than was necessary to keep well away from us. As\r\nwe opened the throttle of the car they, too, increased their speed. It\r\nwas only when we began to shoot and they became thoroughly frightened\r\nthat they showed what they could do.\r\n\r\nI remember especially one fine buck which gave us an exhibition of\r\nreally high-class running. He started almost opposite to us when we\r\nwere on a stretch of splendid road and jogged comfortably along at\r\nthirty-five miles an hour. Our car was running at the same speed, but\r\nhe decided to cross in front and pressed his accelerator a little.\r\nColtman also touched ours, and the motor jumped to forty miles. The\r\nantelope seemed very much surprised and gave his accelerator another\r\npush. Coltman did likewise, and the speedometer registered forty-five\r\nmiles. That was about enough for us, and we held our speed. The animal\r\ndrew ahead on a long curve swinging across in front of the car. He had\r\nbeaten us by a hundred yards!\r\n\r\nBut we had a surprise in store for him, for Coltman suddenly shut off\r\nthe gas and threw on both brakes. Before the motor had fully stopped we\r\nopened fire. The first two bullets struck just behind the antelope and\r\na third kicked the dust between his legs. The shock turned him half\r\nover, but he righted himself and ran to his very limit. The bullets\r\nspattering all about kept him at it for six hundred yards. He put up\r\na desert hare on the way, but that hare didn't have a chance with the\r\nantelope. It reminded me of the story of the negro who had seen a\r\nghost. He ran until he dropped beside the road, but the ghost was right\r\nbeside him. \"Well,\" said the ghost, \"that was _some_ race we had.\"\r\n\"Yes,\" answered the negro, \"but it ain't nothin' to what we're goin' to\r\nhave soon's ever I git my breath. And then,\" said the negro, \"we ran\r\nagin. And I come to a rabbit leggin' it up the road, and I said, 'Git\r\nout of the way, rabbit, and let some one run what _can_ run!'\" The last\r\nwe saw of the antelope was a cloud of yellow dust disappearing over a\r\nlow rise.\r\n\r\nThe excitement of the chase had been an excellent preparation for the\r\nhard work which awaited us not far ahead. The going had been getting\r\nheavier with every mile, and at last we reached a long stretch of sandy\r\nroad which the motors could not pull through. With every one except the\r\ndriver out of the car, and the engine racing, we pushed and lifted,\r\ngaining a few feet each time, until the shifting sand was passed. It\r\nmeant two hours of violent strain, and we were well-nigh exhausted;\r\na few miles farther, however, it had all to be done again. Where the\r\nground was hard, there was such a chaos of ruts and holes that our arms\r\nwere almost wrenched from their sockets by the twisting wheels.\r\n\r\nPLATE II\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT THE END OF THE LONG TRAIL FROM OUTER MONGOLIA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOMEN OF SOUTHERN MONGOLIA]\r\n\r\nThis area more nearly approaches a desert than any other part of the\r\nroad to Urga. The soil is mainly sandy, but the Gobi sagebrush and\r\nshort bunch grass, although sparse and dry, still give a covering of\r\nvegetation, so that in the distance the plain appears like a rolling\r\nmeadowland.\r\n\r\nWhen we saw our first northern Mongol I was delighted. Every one is a\r\nstudy for an artist. He dresses in a long, loose robe of plum color,\r\none corner of which is usually tucked into a gorgeous sash. On his\r\nhead is perched an extraordinary hat which looks like a saucer, with\r\nupturned edges of black velvet and a narrow cone-shaped crown of\r\nbrilliant yellow. Two streamers of red ribbon are usually fastened to\r\nthe rim at the back, or a plume of peacock feathers if he be of higher\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nOn his feet he wears a pair of enormous leather boots with pointed\r\ntoes. These are always many sizes too large, for as the weather grows\r\ncolder he pads them out with heavy socks of wool or fur. It is nearly\r\nimpossible for him to walk in this ungainly footgear, and he waddles\r\nalong exactly like a duck. He is manifestly uncomfortable and ill at\r\nease, but put him on a horse and you have a different picture. The\r\nhigh-peaked saddle and the horse itself become a part of his anatomy\r\nand he will stay there happily fifteen hours of the day.\r\n\r\nThe Mongols ride with short stirrups and, standing nearly upright,\r\nlean far over the horse's neck like our western cowboys. As they tear\r\nalong at full gallop in their brilliant robes they seem to embody the\r\nvery spirit of the plains. They are such genial, accommodating fellows,\r\nalways ready with a pleasant smile, and willing to take a sporting\r\nchance on anything under the sun, that they won my heart at once.\r\n\r\nAbove all things they love a race, and often one of them would range\r\nup beside the car and, with a radiant smile, make signs that he wished\r\nto test our speed. Then off he would go like mad, flogging his horse\r\nand yelling with delight. We would let him gain at first, and the\r\nexpression of joy and triumph on his face was worth going far to see.\r\nSometimes, if the road was heavy, it would need every ounce of gas the\r\ncar could take to forge ahead, for the ponies are splendid animals. The\r\nMongols ride only the best and ride them hard, since horses are cheap\r\nin Mongolia, and when one is a little worn another is always ready.\r\n\r\nNot only does the Mongol inspire you with admiration for his\r\nfull-blooded, virile manhood, but also you like him because he likes\r\nyou. He doesn't try to disguise the fact. There is a frank openness\r\nabout his attitude which is wonderfully appealing, and I believe that\r\nthe average white man can get on terms of easy familiarity, and even\r\nintimacy, with Mongols more rapidly than with any other Orientals.\r\n\r\nUde is the second telegraph station on the road to Urga. It has the\r\nhonor of appearing on most maps of Mongolia and yet it is even less\r\nimpressive than Panj-kiang. There are only two mud houses and half\r\na dozen _yurts_ which seem to have been dropped carelessly behind a\r\nragged hill.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Ude, we slipped rapidly up and down a succession of low\r\nhills and entered upon a plain so vast and flat that we appeared to\r\nbe looking across an ocean. Not the smallest hill or rise of ground\r\nbroke the line where earth and sky met in a faint blue haze. Our cars\r\nseemed like tiny boats in a limitless, grassy sea. It was sixty miles\r\nacross, and for three hours the steady hum of the motor hardly ceased,\r\nfor the road was smooth and hard. Halfway over we saw another great\r\nherd of antelope and several groups of ten or twelve. These were a\r\ndifferent species from those we had killed, and I got a fine young\r\nbuck. Twice wolves trotted across the plain, and at one, which was very\r\ninquisitive, I did some shooting which I vainly try to forget.\r\n\r\nBut most interesting to me among the wild life along our way was the\r\nbustard. It is a huge bird, weighing from fifteen to forty pounds, with\r\nflesh of such delicate flavor that it rivals our best turkey. I had\r\nalways wanted to kill a bustard and my first one was neatly eviscerated\r\nat two hundred yards by a Savage bullet. I was more pleased than if I\r\nhad shot an antelope, perhaps because it did much to revive my spirits\r\nafter the episode of the wolf.\r\n\r\nSand grouse, beautiful little gray birds, with wings like pigeons and\r\nremarkable, padded feet, whistled over us as we rolled along the road,\r\nand my heart was sick with the thought of the excellent shooting we\r\nwere missing. But there was no time to stop, except for such game as\r\nactually crossed our path, else we should never have arrived at Urga,\r\nthe City of the Living God.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of gods, I must not forget to mention the great lamasery at\r\nTurin, about one hundred and seventy miles from Urga. For hours before\r\nwe reached it we saw the ragged hills standing sharp and clear against\r\nthe sky line. The peaks themselves are not more than two hundred feet\r\nin height, but they rise from a rocky plateau some distance above the\r\nlevel of the plain. It is a wild spot where some mighty internal force\r\nhas burst the surface of the earth and pushed up a ragged core of rocks\r\nwhich have been carved by the knives of weather into weird, fantastic\r\nshapes. This elemental battle ground is a fit setting for the most\r\nremarkable group of human habitations that I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nThree temples lie in a bowl-shaped hollow, surrounded by hundreds\r\nupon hundreds of tiny pill-box dwellings painted red and white. There\r\nmust be a thousand of them and probably twice as many lamas. On the\r\noutskirts of the \"city\" to the south enormous piles of _argul_ have\r\nbeen collected by the priests and bestowed as votive offerings by\r\ndevout travelers. Vast as the supply seemed, it would take all this,\r\nand more, to warm the houses of the lamas during the bitter winter\r\nmonths when the ground is covered with snow. On the north the hills\r\nthrow protecting arms about the homes of these half-wild men, who have\r\nchosen to spend their lives in this lonely desert stronghold. The\r\nhouses are built of sawn boards, the first indication we had seen that\r\nwe were nearing a forest country.\r\n\r\nThe remaining one hundred and seventy miles to Urga are a delight, even\r\nto the motorist who loves the paved roads of cities. They are like\r\na boulevard amid glorious, rolling hills luxuriant with long, sweet\r\ngrass. In the distance herds of horses and cattle grouped themselves\r\ninto moving patches, and fat-tailed sheep dotted the plain like drifts\r\nof snow. I have seldom seen a better grazing country. It needed but\r\nlittle imagination to picture what it will be a few years hence when\r\nthe inevitable railroad claims the desert as its own, for this rich\r\nland cannot long remain untenanted. It was here that we saw the first\r\nmarmots, an unfailing indication that we were in a northern country.\r\n\r\nThe thick blackness of a rainy night had enveloped us long before we\r\nswung into the Urga Valley and groped our way along the Tola River\r\nbank toward the glimmering lights of the sacred city. It seemed that\r\nwe would never reach them, for twice we took the wrong turn and found\r\nourselves in a maze of sandy bottoms and half-grown trees. But at ten\r\no'clock we plowed through the mud of a narrow street and into the\r\ncourtyard of the Mongolian Trading Company's home.\r\n\r\nOscar Mamen, Coltman's former partner, and Mrs. Mamen had spent several\r\nyears there, and for six weeks they had had as guests Messrs. A. M.\r\nGuptil and E. B. Price, of Peking. Mr. Guptil was representing the\r\nAmerican Military Attaché, and Mr. Price, Assistant Chinese Secretary\r\nof the American Legation, had come to Urga to establish communication\r\nwith our consul at Irkutsk who had not been heard from for more than a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nUrga recently had been pregnant with war possibilities. In the Lake\r\nBaikal region of Siberia there were several thousand Magyars and many\r\nBolsheviki. It was known that Czechs expected to attack them, and\r\nthat they would certainly be driven across the borders into Mongolia\r\nif defeated. In that event what would be the attitude of the Mongolian\r\ngovernment? Would it intern the belligerents, or allow them to use the\r\nUrga district as a base of operations?\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the question had been settled just before my\r\narrival. The Czechs had made the expected attack with about five\r\nhundred men; all the Magyars, to the number of several thousand, had\r\nsurrendered, and the Bolsheviki had disappeared like mists before the\r\nsun. The front of operations had moved in a single night almost two\r\nthousand miles away to the Omsk district, and it was certain that\r\nMongolia would be left in peace. Mr. Price's work also was done, for\r\nthe telegraph from Urga to Irkutsk was again in operation and thus\r\ncommunication was established with Peking.\r\n\r\nThe morning after my arrival Mr. Guptil and I rode out to see the town.\r\nNever have I visited such a city of contrasts, or one to which I was\r\nso eager to return. As we did come back, I shall tell, in a future\r\nchapter, of what we found there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a \"hard luck\" chapter. Stories of ill-fortune are not always\r\ninteresting, but I am writing this one to show what can happen to an\r\nautomobile in the Gobi. We had gone to Urga without even a puncture and\r\nI began to feel that motoring in Mongolia was as simple as riding on\r\nFifth Avenue--more so, in fact, for we did not have to watch traffic\r\npolicemen or worry about \"right of way.\" There is no crowding on the\r\nGobi Desert. When we passed a camel caravan or a train of ox-carts we\r\nwere sure to have plenty of room, for the landscape was usually spotted\r\nin every direction with fleeing animals.\r\n\r\nOur motors had \"purred\" so steadily that accidents and repair shops\r\nseemed very far away and not of much importance. On the return trip,\r\nhowever, the reverse of the picture was presented and I learned that\r\nto be alone in the desert when something is wrong with the digestion\r\nof your automobile can have its serious aspects. Unless you are an\r\nexpert mechanic and have an assortment of \"spare parts,\" you may have\r\nto walk thirty or forty miles to the nearest water and spend many days\r\nof waiting until help arrives. Fortunately for us, there are few things\r\nwhich either Coltman or Guptil do not know about the \"insides\" of a\r\nmotor and, moreover, after a diagnosis, they both have the ingenuity to\r\nremedy almost any trouble with a hammer and a screw driver.\r\n\r\nFour days after our arrival in Urga we left on the return trip. As\r\noccupants of his car Charles Coltman had Mr. Price, Mrs. Coltman, and\r\nMrs. Mamen. With the spiritual and physical assistance of Mr. Guptil\r\nI drove the second automobile, carrying in the rear seat a wounded\r\nRussian Cossack and a French-Czech, both couriers. The third car was a\r\nFord _chassis_ to which a wooden body had been affixed. It was designed\r\nto give increased carrying space, but it looked like a half-grown\r\nhayrack and was appropriately called the \"agony box.\" This was driven\r\nby a chauffeur named Wang and carried Mamen's Chinese house boy and an\r\n_amah_ besides a miscellaneous assortment of baggage.\r\n\r\nIt was a cold, gray morning when we started, with a cutting wind\r\nsweeping down from the north, giving a hint of the bitter winter which\r\nin another month would hold all Mongolia in an icy grasp. We made our\r\nway eastward up the valley to the Russian bridge across the Tola River\r\nand pointed the cars southward on the caravan trail to Kalgan.\r\n\r\nJust as we reached the summit of the second long hill, across which\r\nthe wind was sweeping in a glacial blast, there came a rasping crash\r\nsomewhere in the motor of my car, followed by a steady _knock, knocks\r\nknock_. \"That's a connecting rod as sure as fate,\" said \"Gup.\" \"We'll\r\nhave to stop.\" When he had crawled under the car and found that his\r\ndiagnosis was correct, he said a few other things which ought to have\r\nrelieved his mind considerably.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be done except to replace the broken part with\r\na spare rod. For three freezing hours Gup and Coltman lay upon their\r\nbacks under the car, while the rest of us gave what help we could. To\r\nadd to the difficulties a shower of hail swept down upon us with all\r\nthe fury of a Mongolian storm. It was three o'clock in the afternoon\r\nbefore we were ready to go on, and our camp that night was only sixty\r\nmiles from Urga.\r\n\r\nThe next day as we passed Turin the Czech pointed out the spot where\r\nhe had lain for three days and nights with a broken collar bone and\r\na dislocated shoulder. He had come from Irkutsk carrying important\r\ndispatches and had taken passage in an automobile belonging to a\r\nChinese company which with difficulty was maintaining a passenger\r\nservice between Urga and Kalgan. As usual, the native chauffeur was\r\ndashing along at thirty-five miles an hour when he should not have\r\ndriven faster than twenty at the most. One of the front wheels slid\r\ninto a deep rut, the car turned completely over and the resulting\r\ncasualties numbered one man dead and our Czech seriously injured. It\r\nwas three days before another car carried him back to Urga, where the\r\nbroken bones were badly set by a drunken Russian doctor. The Cossack,\r\ntoo, had been shot twice in the heavy fighting on the Russian front,\r\nand, although his wounds were barely healed, he had just ridden three\r\nhundred miles on horseback with dispatches for Peking.\r\n\r\nBoth my passengers were delighted to have escaped the Chinese motors,\r\nfor in them accidents had been the rule rather than the exception.\r\nDuring one year nineteen cars had been smashed and lay in masses of\r\ntwisted metal beside the road. The difficulty had been largely due\r\nto the native chauffeurs. Although these men can drive a car, they\r\nhave no mechanical training and danger signals from the motor are\r\nentirely disregarded. Moreover, all Chinese dearly love \"show\" and the\r\nchauffeurs delight in driving at tremendous speed over roads where they\r\nshould exercise the greatest care. The deep cart ruts are a continual\r\nmenace, for between them the road is often smooth and fine. But a stone\r\nor a tuft of grass may send one of the front wheels into a rut and\r\ncapsize the car. Even with the greatest care accidents will happen, and\r\nmotoring in Mongolia is by no means devoid of danger and excitement.\r\n\r\nAbout three o'clock in the afternoon of the second day we saw frantic\r\nsignals from the agony box which had been lumbering along behind us. It\r\nappeared that the right rear wheel was broken and the car could go no\r\nfarther. There was nothing for it but to camp right where we were while\r\nCharles repaired the wheel. Gup and I ran twenty miles down the road to\r\nlook for a well, but without success. The remaining water was divided\r\nequally among us but next morning we discovered that the Chinese had\r\nsecreted two extra bottles for themselves, while we had been saving\r\nours to the last drop. It taught me a lesson by which I profited the\r\nfollowing summer.\r\n\r\nOn the third day the agony box limped along until noon, but when we\r\nreached a well in the midst of the great plain south of Turin it had\r\nto be abandoned, while we went on to Ude, the telegraph station in the\r\nmiddle of the desert, and wired Mamen to bring a spare wheel from Urga.\r\n\r\nThe fourth day there was more trouble with the connecting rod on my\r\ncar and we sat for two hours at a well while the motor was eviscerated\r\nand reassembled. It had ceased to be a joke, especially to Coltman and\r\nGuptil, for all the work fell upon them. By this time they were almost\r\nunrecognizable because of dirt and grease and their hands were cut and\r\nblistered. But they stood it manfully, and at each new accident Gup\r\nrose to greater and greater heights of oratory.\r\n\r\nWe were halfway between Ude and Panj-kiang when we saw two automobiles\r\napproaching from the south. Their occupants were foreigners we were\r\nsure, and as they stopped beside us a tall young man came up to my car.\r\n\"I am Langdon Warner,\" he said. We shook hands and looked at each other\r\ncuriously. Warner is an archæologist and Director of the Pennsylvania\r\nMuseum. For ten years we had played a game of hide and seek through\r\nhalf the countries of the Orient and it seemed that we were destined\r\nnever to meet each other. In 1910 I drifted into the quaint little town\r\nof Naha in the Loo-Choo Islands, that forgotten kingdom of the East. At\r\nthat time it was far off the beaten track and very few foreigners had\r\nsought it out since 1854, when Commodore Perry negotiated a treaty with\r\nits king in the picturesque old Shuri Palace. Only a few months before\r\nI arrived, Langdon Warner had visited it on a collecting trip and the\r\nnatives had not yet ceased to talk about the strange foreigner who gave\r\nthem new baskets for old ones.\r\n\r\nA little later Warner preceded me to Japan, and in 1912 I followed\r\nhim to Korea. Our paths diverged when I went to Alaska in 1913, but I\r\ncrossed his trail again in China, and in 1916, just before my wife and\r\nI left for Yün-nan, I missed him in Boston where I had gone to lecture\r\nat Harvard University. It was strange that after ten years we should\r\nmeet for the first time in the middle of the Gobi Desert!\r\n\r\nWarner was proceeding to Urga with two Czech officers who were on their\r\nway to Irkutsk. We gave them the latest news of the war situation and\r\nmuch to their disgust they realized that had they waited only two weeks\r\nlonger they could have gone by train, for the attack by the Czechs on\r\nthe Magyars and the Bolsheviki, in the trans-Baikal region, had cleared\r\nthe Siberian railway westward as far as Omsk. After half an hour's talk\r\nwe drove off in opposite directions. Warner eventually reached Irkutsk,\r\nbut not without some interesting experiences with Bolsheviki along the\r\nway, and I did not see him again until last March (1920), when he came\r\nto my office in the American Museum just after we had returned to New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Panj-kiang we felt that our motor troubles were at an\r\nend, but ten miles beyond the station my car refused to pull through a\r\nsand pit and we found that there was trouble with the differential.\r\nIt was necessary to dismantle the rear end of the car, and Coltman and\r\nGup were well-nigh discouraged. The delay was a serious matter for I\r\nhad urgent business in Japan, and it was imperative that I reach Peking\r\nas soon as possible. Charles finally decided to send me, together\r\nwith Price, the Czech, and the Cossack, in his car, while he and Gup\r\nremained with the two ladies to repair mine.\r\n\r\nPrice and I drove back to Panj-kiang to obtain extra food and water for\r\nthe working party and to telegraph Kalgan for assistance. We took only\r\na little tea, macaroni, and two tins of sausage, for we expected to\r\nreach the mission station at Hei-ma-hou early the next morning.\r\n\r\nWe were hardly five miles from the broken car when we discovered that\r\nthere was no more oil for our motor. It was impossible to go much\r\nfarther and we decided that the only alternative was to wait until the\r\nrelief party, for which we had wired, arrived from Kalgan. Just then\r\nthe car swung over the summit of a rise, and we saw the white tent and\r\ngrazing camels of an enormous caravan. Of course, Mongols would have\r\nmutton fat and why not use that for oil! The caravan leader assured\r\nus that he had fat in plenty and in ten minutes a great pot of it was\r\nwarming over the fire.\r\n\r\nWe poured it into the motor and proceeded merrily on our way. But\r\nthere was one serious obstacle to our enjoyment of that ride. Events\r\nhad been moving so rapidly that we had eaten nothing since breakfast,\r\nand when a delicious odor of roast lamb began to arise from the motor,\r\nwe realized that we were all very hungry. Dry macaroni would hardly\r\ndo and the sausage must be saved for dinner. All the afternoon that\r\ntantalizing odor hovered in the air and I began to imagine that I could\r\neven smell mint sauce.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock we saw the first _yurt_ and purchased a supply of\r\n_argul_ so that we could save time in making camp. The lamps of the\r\ncar were _hors de combat_ and a watery moon did not give us sufficient\r\nlight by which to drive in safety, so we stopped on a hilltop shortly\r\nafter dark. In the morning when the motor was cold we could save time\r\nand strength in cranking by pushing it down the slope.\r\n\r\nMuch to our disgust we found that the _argul_ we had purchased from\r\nthe Mongol was so mixed with dirt that it would not burn. After half\r\nan hour of fruitless work I gave up, and we divided the tin of cold\r\nsausage. It was a pretty meager dinner for four hungry men and I\r\nretired into my sleeping bag to dream of roast lamb and mint sauce.\r\nWhen the Cossack officer found that he was not to have his tea he was\r\nlike a child with a stick of candy just out of reach. He tried to sleep\r\nbut it was no use, and in half an hour I opened my eyes to see him\r\nflat on his face blowing lustily at a piece of _argul_ which he had\r\npersuaded to emit a faint glow. For two mortal hours the Russian nursed\r\nthat fire until his pot of water reached the boiling point. Then he\r\ninsisted that we all wake up to share his triumph.\r\n\r\nPLATE III\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MIDDLE AGES AND THE TWENTIETH CENTURY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MONGOLIAN ANTELOPE KILLED FROM OUR MOTOR CARS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATERING CAMELS AT A WELL IN THE GOBI DESERT]\r\n\r\nWe reached the mission station at noon next day, and Father Weinz,\r\nthe Belgian priest in charge, gave us the first meal we had had in\r\nthirty-six hours. The Czech courier decided to remain at Hei-ma-hou and\r\ngo in next day by cart, but we started immediately on the forty-mile\r\nhorseback ride to Kalgan. A steady rain began about two o'clock in the\r\nafternoon, and in half an hour we were soaked to the skin; then the\r\nugly, little gray stallion upon which I had been mounted planted both\r\nhind feet squarely on my left leg as we toiled up a long hill-trail to\r\nthe pass, and I thought that my walking days had ended for all time.\r\nAt the foot of the pass we halted at a dirty inn where they told us it\r\nwould be useless to go on to Kalgan, for the gates of the city would\r\ncertainly be closed and it would be impossible to enter until morning.\r\nThere was no alternative except to spend the night at the inn, but as\r\nthey had only a grass fire which burned out as soon as the cooking was\r\nfinished, and as all our clothes were soaked, we spent sleepless hours\r\nshivering with cold.\r\n\r\nThe Cossack spoke only Mongol and Russian, and, as neither of us knew\r\na single word of either language, it was difficult to communicate our\r\nplans to him. Finally, we found a Chinaman who spoke Mongol and who\r\nconsented to act as interpreter. The natives at the inn could not\r\nunderstand why we were not able to talk to the Cossack. Didn't all\r\nwhite men speak the same language? Mr. Price endeavored to explain that\r\nRussian and English differ as much as do Chinese and Mongol, but they\r\nonly smiled and shook their heads.\r\n\r\nIn the morning I was so stiff from the kick which the gray stallion\r\nhad given me that I could get to his back only with the greatest\r\ndifficulty, but we reached Kalgan at eight o'clock. Unfortunately, the\r\nCossack had left his passport in the cart which was to follow with his\r\nbaggage, and the police at the gate would not let us pass. Mr. Price\r\nwas well known to them and offered to assume responsibility for the\r\nCossack in the name of the American Legation, but the policemen, who\r\nwere much disgruntled at being roused so early in the morning, refused\r\nto let us enter.\r\n\r\nTheir attitude was so obviously absurd that we agreed to take matters\r\ninto our own hands. We strolled outside the house and suddenly jumped\r\non our horses. The sentries made a vain attempt to catch our bridle\r\nreins and we rode down the street at a sharp trot. There was another\r\npolice station in the center of the city which it was impossible to\r\navoid and as we approached it we saw a line of soldiers drawn up\r\nacross the road. Our friends at the gate had telephoned ahead to have\r\nus stopped. Without hesitating we kept on, riding straight at the\r\ngray-clad policemen. With wildly waving arms they shouted at us to\r\nhalt, but we paid not the slightest attention, and they had to jump\r\naside to avoid being run down. The spectacle which these Chinese\r\nsoldiers presented, as they tried to arrest us, was so ridiculous that\r\nwe roared with laughter. Imagine what would happen on Fifth Avenue if\r\nyou disregarded a traffic policeman's signal to stop!\r\n\r\nAlthough the officials knew that we could be found at Mr. Coltman's\r\nhouse, we heard nothing further from the incident. It was so obviously\r\na matter of personal ill nature on the part of the captain in charge\r\nof the gate police that they realized it was not a subject for further\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nAfter the luxury of a bath and shave we proceeded to Peking. Charles\r\nand Gup had rather a beastly time getting in. The car could not be\r\nrepaired sufficiently to carry on under its own power, and, through a\r\nmisunderstanding, the relief party only went as far as the pass and\r\nwaited there for their arrival. They eventually found it necessary to\r\nhire three horses to tow them to the mission station where the \"hard\r\nluck\" story ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nNEW TRAVELS ON AN OLD TRAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1918-19 we spent in and out of one of the most\r\ninteresting cities in the world. Peking, with its background of history\r\nmade vividly real by its splendid walls, its age-old temples and its\r\nmysterious Forbidden City, has a personality of its own.\r\n\r\nWhen we had been away for a month or two there was always a delightful\r\nfeeling of anticipation in returning to the city itself and to our\r\nfriends in its cosmopolitan community.\r\n\r\nMoreover, at our house in Wu Liang Tajen Hutung, a baby boy and his\r\ndevoted nurse were waiting to receive us. Even at two years the\r\nextraordinary facility with which he discovered frogs and bugs, which,\r\nquite unknown to us, dwelt in the flower-filled courtyard, showed the\r\nhereditary instincts of a born explorer.\r\n\r\nThat winter gave us an opportunity to see much of ancient China, for we\r\nvisited Shantung, traveled straight across the Provinces of Honan and\r\nHupeh, and wandered about the mountains of Che-kiang on a serow hunt.\r\n\r\nIn February the equipment for our summer's work in Mongolia was on its\r\nway across the desert by caravan. We had sent flour, bacon, coffee,\r\ntea, sugar, butter and dried fruit, for these could be purchased in\r\nUrga only at prohibitive prices. Even then, with camel charges at\r\nfourteen cents a _cattie_ (1-1/3 lbs.), a fifty-pound sack of flour\r\ncost us more than six dollars by the time it reached Urga.\r\n\r\nCharles Coltman at Kalgan very kindly relieved me of all the\r\ntransportation details. We had seen him several times in Peking during\r\nthe winter, and had planned the trip across the plains to Urga as _une\r\nbelle excursion_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Coltman was going, of course, as were Mr. and Mrs. \"Ted\" MacCallie\r\nof Tientsin. \"Mac\" was a famous Cornell football star whom I knew by\r\nreputation in my own college days. He was to take a complete Delco\r\nelectric lighting plant to Urga, with the hope of installing it in the\r\npalace of the \"Living God.\"\r\n\r\nA soldier named Owen from the Legation guard in Peking was to drive the\r\nDelco car, and I had two Chinese taxidermists, Chen and Kang, besides\r\nLü, our cook and camp boy.\r\n\r\nChen had been loaned to me by Dr. J. G. Andersson, Mining Adviser\r\nto the Chinese Republic, and proved to be one of the best native\r\ncollectors whom I have ever employed. The Coltmans and MacCallies were\r\nto stay only a few days in Urga, but they helped to make the trip\r\nacross Mongolia one of the most delightful parts of our glorious summer.\r\n\r\nWe left Kalgan on May 17. Mac, Owen, and I rode the forty miles to\r\nHei-ma-hou on horseback while Charles drove a motor occupied by the\r\nthree women. There is a circuitous route by which cars can cross the\r\npass under their own power, but Coltman preferred the direct road and\r\nsent four mules to tow the automobile up the mountains to the edge of\r\nthe plateau.\r\n\r\nIt was the same trail I had followed the previous September. Then, as I\r\nstood on the summit of the pass gazing back across the far, dim hills,\r\nmy heart was sad for I was about to enter a new land alone. My \"best\r\nassistant\" was on the ocean coming as fast as steam could carry her\r\nto join me in Peking. I wondered if Fate's decree would bring us here\r\ntogether that we might both have, as a precious heritage for future\r\nyears, the memories of this strange land of romance and of mystery. Now\r\nthe dream had been fulfilled and never have I entered a new country\r\nwith greater hopes of what it would bring to me. Never, too, have such\r\nhopes been more gloriously realized.\r\n\r\nWe packed the cars that night and at half past five the next morning\r\nwere on the road. The sky was gray and cloud-hung, but by ten o'clock\r\nthe sun burned out and we gradually emerged from the fur robes in which\r\nwe had been buried.\r\n\r\nInstead of the fields of ripening grain which in the previous autumn\r\nhad spread the hills with a flowing golden carpet, we saw blue-clad\r\nChinese farmers turning long brown furrows with homemade plows. The\r\ntrees about the mission station had just begun to show a tinge of\r\ngreen--the first sign of awakening at the touch of spring from the long\r\nwinter sleep. Already caravans were astir, and we passed lines of laden\r\ncamels now almost at the end of the long journey from Outer Mongolia,\r\nwhither we were bound. But, instead of splendid beasts with upstanding\r\nhumps and full neck beards, the camels now were pathetic mountains of\r\nalmost naked skin on which the winter hair hung in ragged patches.\r\nThe humps were loose and flat and flapped disconsolately as the great\r\nbodies lurched along the trail.\r\n\r\nWhen we passed one caravan a _débonnaire_ old Mongol wearing a derby\r\nhat swung out of line and signaled us to stop. After an appraising\r\nglance at the car he smiled broadly and indicated that he would like\r\nto race. In a moment he was off yelling at the top of his lungs and\r\nbelaboring the bony sides of his camel with feet and hands. The\r\nanimal's ungainly legs swung like a windmill in every direction it\r\nseemed, except forward, and yet the Mongol managed to keep his rolling\r\nold \"ship of the desert\" abreast of us for several minutes. Finally\r\nwe let him win the race, and his look of delight was worth going far\r\nto see as he waved us good-by and with a hearty \"_sai-bei-nah_\" loped\r\nslowly back to the caravan.\r\n\r\nThe road was much better than it had been the previous fall. During the\r\nwinter the constant tramp of padded feet had worn down and filled the\r\nruts which had been cut by the summer traffic of spike-wheeled carts.\r\nBut the camels had almost finished their winter's work. In a few weeks\r\nthey would leave the trail to ox and pony caravans and spend the hot\r\nmonths in idleness, storing quantities of fat in their great hump\r\nreservoirs.\r\n\r\nThere was even more bird life than I had seen the previous September.\r\nThe geese had all flown northward where we would find them scattered\r\nover their summer breeding grounds, but thousands of demoiselle cranes\r\n(_Anthropoides virgo_) had taken their places in the fields. They were\r\nin the midst of the spring courting and seemed to have lost all fear.\r\nOne pair remained beside the road until we were less than twenty feet\r\naway, stepping daintily aside only when we threatened to run them\r\ndown. Another splendid male performed a love dance for the benefit of\r\nhis prospective bride quite undisturbed by the presence of our cars.\r\nWith half-spread wings he whirled and leaped about the lady while\r\nevery feather on her slim, blue body expressed infinite boredom and\r\nindifference to his passionate appeal.\r\n\r\nRuddy sheldrakes, mallards, shoveler ducks, and teal were in even the\r\nsmallest ponds and avocets with sky-blue legs and slender recurved\r\nbills ran along the shores of a lake at which we stopped for tiffin.\r\nWhen we had passed the last Chinese village and were well in the\r\nMongolian grasslands we had great fun shooting gophers (_Citellus\r\nmongolicus umbratus_) from the cars. It was by no means easy to kill\r\nthem before they slipped into their dens, and I often had to burrow\r\nlike a terrier to pull them out even when they were almost dead.\r\n\r\nWe got eighteen, and camped at half past four in order that the\r\ntaxidermists might have time to prepare the skins. There was a hint\r\nof rain in the air and we pitched the tent for emergencies, although\r\nnone of us wished to sleep inside. Mac suggested that we utilize the\r\nelectric light plant even if we were on the Mongolian plains. In half\r\nan hour he had installed wires in the tent and placed an arc lamp\r\non the summit of a pole. It was an extraordinary experience to see\r\nthe canvas walls about us, to hear the mournful wail of a lone wolf\r\noutside, and yet be able to turn the switch of an electric light as\r\nthough we were in the city. No arc lamp on Fifth Avenue blazed more\r\nbrightly than did this one on the edge of the Gobi Desert where none of\r\nits kind had ever shone before. With the motor cars which had stolen\r\nthe sanctity of the plains it was only another evidence of the passing\r\nof Mongolian mystery.\r\n\r\nUsually when we camped we could see, almost immediately, the\r\nsilhouettes of approaching Mongols black against the evening sky. Where\r\nthey came from we could never guess. For miles there might not have\r\nbeen the trace of a human being, but suddenly they would appear as\r\nthough from out the earth itself. Perhaps they had been riding along\r\nsome distant ridge far beyond the range of white men's eyes, or the\r\nroar of a motor had carried to their ears across the miles of plain; or\r\nperhaps it was that unknown sense, which seems to have been developed\r\nin these children of the desert, which directs them unerringly to\r\nwater, to a lost horse, or to others of their kind. Be it what it may,\r\nalmost every night the Mongols came loping into camp on their hardy,\r\nlittle ponies.\r\n\r\nBut this evening, when we had prepared an especial celebration, the\r\naudience did not arrive. It was a bitter disappointment, for we were\r\nconsumed with curiosity to know what effect the blazing arc would\r\nhave upon the Mongolian stoics. We could not believe that natives\r\nhad not seen the light but probably they thought it was some spirit\r\nmanifestation which was to be avoided. An hour after we were snuggled\r\nin our fur sleeping bags, two Mongols rode into camp, but we were too\r\nsleepy to give an exhibition of the fire-works.\r\n\r\nWe reached Panj-kiang about noon of the second day and found that a\r\nlarge mud house and a spacious compound had been erected beside the\r\ntelegraph station by the Chinese company which was endeavoring to\r\nmaintain a passenger service between Kalgan and Urga. The Chinese\r\ngovernment also had invaded the field and was sending automobiles\r\nregularly to the Mongolian capital as a branch service of the\r\nPeking-Suiyuan railroad. In the previous September we had passed\r\nhalf a dozen of their motors in charge of a foreign representative\r\nof Messrs. Jardine, Matheson and Co. of Shanghai from whom the cars\r\nwere purchased. He discovered immediately that the difficulties which\r\nthe Chinese had encountered were largely the result of incompetent\r\nchauffeurs.\r\n\r\nWe had kept a sharp lookout for antelope, but saw nothing except a fox\r\nwhich looked so huge in the clear air that all of us were certain it\r\nwas a wolf. There are always antelope on the Panj-kiang plain, however,\r\nand we loaded the magazines of our rifles as soon as we left the\r\ntelegraph station. I was having a bit of sport with an immense flock\r\nof golden plover (_Pluvialis dominicus fulvus_) when the people in the\r\ncars signaled me to return, for a fine antelope buck was standing only\r\na few hundred yards from the road. The ground was as smooth and hard as\r\nan asphalt pavement and we skimmed along at forty miles an hour. When\r\nthe animal had definitely made up its mind to cross in front of us,\r\nCharles gave the accelerator a real push and the car jumped to a speed\r\nof forty-eight miles. The antelope was doing his level best to \"cross\r\nour bows\" but he was too far away, and for a few moments it seemed that\r\nwe would surely crash into him if he held his course. It was a great\r\nrace. Yvette had a death grip on my coat, for I was sitting half over\r\nthe edge of the car ready to jump when Charles threw on the brakes.\r\nWith any one but Coltman at the wheel I would have been too nervous to\r\nenjoy the ride, but we all had confidence in his superb driving.\r\n\r\nThe buck crossed the road not forty yards in front of us, just at the\r\nsummit of a tiny hill. Charles and I both fired once, and the antelope\r\nturned half over in a whirl of dust. It disappeared behind the hill\r\ncrest and we expected to find it dead on the other side, but the slope\r\nwas empty and even with our glasses we could not discover a sign of\r\nlife on the plain, which stretched away to the horizon apparently as\r\nlevel as a floor. It had been swallowed utterly as though by the magic\r\npocket of a conjurer.\r\n\r\nMac had not participated in the fun, for it had been a one-man race.\r\nFifteen minutes later, however, we had a \"free for all\" which gave him\r\nhis initiation.\r\n\r\nAn extract from Yvette's \"Journal\" gives her impression of the chase:\r\n\r\n\"Some one pointed out the distant, moving specks on the horizon and in\r\na moment our car had left the road and started over the plains. Nearer\r\nand nearer we came, and faster and faster ran the antelope stringing\r\nout in a long, yellow line before us. The speedometer was moving up\r\nand up, thirty miles, thirty-five miles. Roy was sitting on the edge\r\nof the car with his legs hanging out, rifle in hand, ready to swing to\r\nthe ground as soon as the car halted. Mr. Coltman, who was driving,\r\nhad already thrown on the brakes, but Roy, thinking in his excitement\r\nthat he had stopped, jumped--and jumped too soon. The speed at which\r\nwe were going threw him violently to the ground. I hardly dared look\r\nto see what had happened but somehow he turned a complete somersault,\r\nlanded on his knees, and instantly began shooting. Mr. Coltman, his\r\nhands trembling with the exertion of the drive, opened fire across the\r\nwind shield. As the first reports crashed out, the antelope, which had\r\nseemed to be flying before, flattened out and literally skimmed over\r\nthe plain. Half a dozen bullets struck behind the herd, then as Roy's\r\nrifle cracked again, one of those tiny specks dropped to the ground.\r\n\r\nPLATE IV\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WATER CARRIER FOR A CARAVAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A THIRTY-FIVE POUND BUZZARD]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG MONGOLIA]\r\n\r\n\"If was a wonderful shot--four hundred and twenty yards measured\r\ndistance. No, this isn't a woman's inaccuracy of figures, it's a fact.\r\nBut then you must remember the extraordinary clearness of the air in\r\nMongolia, where every object appears to be magnified half a dozen\r\ntimes. The brilliant atmosphere is one of the most bewildering things\r\nof the desert. Once we thought we saw an antelope grazing on the\r\nhillside and Mr. Coltman remarked disdainfully: 'Pooh, that's a horse.'\r\nBut the laugh was on him for as we drew near the 'horse' proved to be\r\nonly a bleached bone. At a short distance camels and ponies stood out\r\nas though cut in steel, seeming as high as a village church steeple;\r\nand, most ridiculous of all, my husband mistook me once at a long, long\r\ndistance for a telegraph pole! Tartarin de Tarascon would have had some\r\nwonderful stories to tell of Mongolia!\"\r\n\r\nWe had hardly reached the road again before Mrs. Coltman discovered a\r\ngreat herd of antelope on the slope of a low hill, and when the cars\r\ncarried us over the crest we could see animals in every direction,\r\nfeeding in pairs or in groups of ten to forty.\r\n\r\nWe all agreed that no better place could be found at which to obtain\r\nmotion pictures and camp was made forthwith. Unfortunately, the\r\ngazelles were shedding their winter coats and the skins were useless\r\nexcept for study; however, I did need half a dozen skeletons, so the\r\nanimals we killed would not be wasted.\r\n\r\nIt was four o'clock in the afternoon when the tents were up and too\r\nlate to take pictures; therefore, the photography was postponed until\r\nthe next day, and we ran over toward a herd of antelope which was\r\njust visible on the sky line. When each of us had killed an animal,\r\nthe opinion was unanimous that we had enough. I got mine on the first\r\nchase and thenceforth employed my time in making observations on the\r\nantelope's speed.\r\n\r\nTime after time the car reached forty miles an hour, but with an even\r\nstart the gazelles could swing about in front and \"cross our bows.\"\r\nOne of the antelope had a front leg broken just below the knee, and\r\ngave us a hard chase with the car going at thirty-five miles an hour. I\r\nestimated that even in its crippled condition the animal was traveling\r\nat a rate of _not less than twenty-five miles an hour_.\r\n\r\nMy field notes tell of a similar experience with the last gazelle\r\nwhich Mac killed late in the afternoon. \"... We ran toward another\r\ngroup of antelope standing on the summit of a long land swell. There\r\nwere fourteen in this herd and as the car neared them they trotted\r\nabout with heads up, evidently trying to decide what species of plains\r\nanimal we represented. The sun had just set, and I shall never forget\r\nthe picture which they made, their graceful figures showing in black\r\nsilhouettes against the rose glow of the evening sky. There was one\r\nbuck among them and they seemed very nervous. When the men leaped out\r\nto shoot we were fully two hundred and fifty yards away, but at his\r\nthird shot Mac dropped the buck. It was up again and off before the\r\nmotor started in pursuit and, although running apart from the herd,\r\nit was only a short distance behind the others. Evidently the right\r\nforeleg was broken but with the car traveling at twenty-five miles\r\nan hour it was still drawing ahead. The going was not good and we\r\nran for two miles without gaining an inch; then we came to a bit of\r\nsmooth plain and the motor shot ahead at thirty-five miles an hour.\r\nWe gained slowly and, when about one hundred yards away, I leaped out\r\nand fired at the animal breaking the other foreleg low down on the\r\nleft side. Even with two legs injured it still traveled at a rate of\r\nfifteen miles, and a third shot was required to finish the unfortunate\r\nbusiness. We found that both limbs were broken below the knee, and that\r\nthe animal had been running on the stumps.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nANTELOPE MOVIE STARS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was eight o'clock before we finished breakfast in the morning, but\r\nwe did not wish to begin the motion picture photography until the sun\r\nwas high enough above the horizon to give us a clear field for work.\r\nCharles and I rigged the tripod firmly in the _tonneau_ of one of the\r\ncars. Mrs. Mac and Wang, a Chinese driver, were in the front seat,\r\nwhile Yvette and I squeezed in beside the camera. The Coltmans, Mac,\r\nand Owen occupied the other motor. We found a herd of antelope within\r\na mile of camp and they, paraded in beautiful formation as the car\r\napproached. It would have made a splendid picture, but although the\r\ntwo automobiles were of the same make, there was a vast difference in\r\ntheir speed and it was soon evident that we could not keep pace with\r\nthe other motor. After two or three ineffectual attempts we roped the\r\ncamera in the most powerful car, the three men came in with me, and the\r\nwomen transferred to Wang's machine.\r\n\r\nThe last herd of antelope had disappeared over a long hill, and when\r\nwe reached the summit we saw that they had separated into four groups\r\nand scattered about on the plains below us. We selected the largest,\r\ncontaining about fifty animals, and ran toward if as fast as the car\r\ncould travel. The herd divided when we were still several hundred\r\nyards away, but the larger part gave promise of swinging across our\r\npath. The ground was thinly covered with short bunch grass, and when\r\nwe reached a speed of thirty-five miles an hour the car was bounding\r\nand leaping over the tussocks like a ship in a heavy gale. I tried to\r\nstand, but after twice being almost pitched out bodily I gave it up and\r\noperated the camera by kneeling on the rear seat. Mac helped anchor me\r\nby sitting on my left leg, and we got one hundred feet of film from\r\nthe first herd. Races with three other groups gave us two hundred feet\r\nmore, and as the gasoline in our tank was alarmingly depleted we turned\r\nback toward camp.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I did not reload the camera with a fresh roll of film and\r\nthereby missed one of the most unusual and interesting pictures which\r\never could be obtained upon the plains. The tents were already in sight\r\nwhen a wolf suddenly appeared on the crest of a grassy knoll. He looked\r\nat us for a moment and then set off at an easy lope. The temptation was\r\ntoo great to be resisted even though there was a strong possibility\r\nthat we might be stalled in the desert with no gas.\r\n\r\nThe ground was smooth and hard, and our speedometer showed forty miles\r\nan hour. We soon began to gain, but for three miles he gave us a\r\nsplendid race. Suddenly, as we came over a low hill, we saw an enormous\r\nherd of antelope directly in front of us. They were not more than two\r\nhundred yards away, and the wolf made straight for them. Panic-stricken\r\nat the sight of their hereditary enemy followed by the roaring car,\r\nthey scattered wildly and then swung about to cross our path. The wolf\r\ndashed into their midst and the herd divided as though cut by a knife.\r\nSome turned short about, but the others kept on toward us until I\r\nthought we would actually run them down. When not more than fifty yards\r\nfrom the motor they wheeled sharply and raced along beside the wolf.\r\n\r\nTo add to the excitement a fat, yellow marmot, which seemed suddenly to\r\nhave lost his mind, galloped over the plain as fast as his short legs\r\ncould carry him until he remembered that safety lay underground; then\r\nhe popped into his burrow like a billiard ball into a pocket. With this\r\nstrange assortment fleeing in front of the car we felt as though we had\r\ninvaded a zoölogical garden.\r\n\r\nThe wolf paid not the slightest attention to the antelope for he had\r\ntroubles of his own. We were almost on him, and I could see his red\r\ntongue between the foam-flecked jaws. Suddenly he dodged at right\r\nangles, and it was only by a clever bit of driving that Charles avoided\r\ncrashing into him with the left front wheel. Before we could swing\r\nabout the wolf had gained five hundred yards, but he was almost done.\r\nIn another mile we had him right beside the car, and Coltman leaned\r\nfar out to kill him with his pistol. The first bullet struck so close\r\nbehind the animal that it turned him half over, and he dodged again\r\njust in time to meet a shot from Mac's rifle which broke his back.\r\nWith its dripping lips drawn over a set of ugly teeth, the beast glared\r\nat us, as much as to say, \"It is your move next, but don't come too\r\nclose,\" Had it been any animal except a wolf I should have felt a\r\ntwinge of pity, but I had no sympathy for the skulking brute. There\r\nwill be more antelope next year because of its death.\r\n\r\nAll this had happened with an unloaded camera in the automobile. I had\r\ntried desperately to adjust a new roll of film, but had given up in\r\ndespair for it was difficult enough even to sit in the bounding car.\r\nWere I to spend the remainder of my life in Mongolia there might never\r\nbe such a chance again.\r\n\r\nBut we had an opportunity to learn just how fast a wolf can run, for\r\nthe one we had killed was undoubtedly putting his best foot forward.\r\nI estimated that even at first he was not doing more than thirty-five\r\nmiles an hour, and later we substantiated it on another, which gave\r\nus a race of twelve miles. With antelope which can reach fifty-five\r\nto sixty miles an hour a wolf has little chance, unless he catches\r\nthem unawares, or finds the newly born young. To avoid just this the\r\nantelope are careful to stay well out on the plains where there are no\r\nrocks or hills to conceal a skulking wolf.\r\n\r\nThe wolf we had killed was shedding its hair and presented a most\r\ndilapidated, moth-eaten appearance; moreover, it had just been feeding\r\non the carcass of a dead camel, which subsequently we discovered a\r\nmile away. When we reached camp I directed the two taxidermists to\r\nprepare the skeleton of the wolf, but to keep well away from the tents.\r\n\r\nCharles and I had been talking a good deal about antelope steak, and\r\nfor tiffin I had cut the fillets from one of the young gazelle. We were\r\nvery anxious to \"make good\" on all that had been promised, so we cooked\r\nthe steak ourselves. Just when the party was assembled in the tent for\r\nluncheon the Chinese began work upon the wolf. They had obediently\r\ngone to a considerable distance to perform the last rites, but had not\r\nchosen wisely in regard to the wind. As the antelope steak was brought\r\nin, a gentle breeze wafted with it a concentrated essence of defunct\r\ncamel. Yvette put down her knife and fork and looked up. She caught\r\nmy eye and burst out laughing. Mrs. Mac had her hand clasped firmly\r\nover her mouth and on her face was an expression of horror and deathly\r\nnausea.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am a great lover of antelope steak, I will admit that when\r\naccompanied by _parfum de chameau_, especially when it is a very dead\r\n_chameau_, there are other things more attractive. Moreover, the\r\nantelope which we killed on the Panj-kiang plain really were very\r\nstrong indeed. I have never been able to discover what was the cause,\r\nfor those farther to the north were as delicious as any we have ever\r\neaten. The introduction was such an unfortunate one that the party\r\nshied badly whenever antelope meat was mentioned during the remainder\r\nof the trip to Urga. Coltman, who had charge of the commissary, quite\r\nnaturally expected that we would depend largely on meat and had not\r\nprovided a sufficiency of other food. As a result we found that after\r\nthe third day rations were becoming very short.\r\n\r\nWe camped that night at a well in a sandy river bottom about ten miles\r\nbeyond Ude, the halfway point on the trip to Urga. It had been a bad\r\nday, with a bitterly cold wind which drove the dust and tiny pebbles\r\nagainst our faces like a continual storm of hail. As soon as the cars\r\nhad stopped every one of us set to work with soap and water before\r\nanything had been done toward making camp. Our one desire was to remove\r\na part of the dirt which had sifted into our eyes, hair, mouths, and\r\nears. In half an hour we looked more brightly upon the world and began\r\nto wonder what we would have for dinner. It was a discussion which\r\ncould not be carried on for very long since the bread was almost gone\r\nand only macaroni remained. Just then a demoiselle crane alighted\r\nbeside the well not forty yards away. \"There's our dinner,\" Charles\r\nshouted, \"shoot it.\"\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later I was stripping off the feathers, and in less than\r\nfive minutes it was sizzling in the pan. That was a bit too much for\r\nMrs. Mac, hungry as she was. \"Just think,\" she said, \"that bird was\r\nwalking about here not ten minutes ago and now it's on my plate. It\r\nhasn't stopped wiggling yet. I can't eat it!\"\r\n\r\nPoor girl, she went to bed hungry, and in the night waked to find her\r\nface terribly swollen from wind and sunburn. She was certain that she\r\nwas about to die, but decided, like the \"good sport\" she is, to die\r\nalone upon the hillside where she wouldn't disturb the camp. After\r\nhalf an hour of wandering about she felt better, and returned to her\r\nsleeping bag on the sandy river bottom.\r\n\r\nJust before dark we heard the _dong, dong, dong_ of a camel's bell\r\nand saw the long line of dusty yellow animals swing around a sharp\r\nearth-corner into the sandy space beside the well. Like the trained\r\nunits of an army each camel came into position, kneeled upon the ground\r\nand remained quietly chewing its cud until the driver removed the load.\r\nLong before the last straggler had arrived the tents were up and a fire\r\nblazing, and far into the night the thirsty beasts grunted and roared\r\nas the trough was filled with water.\r\n\r\nFor thirty-six days they had been on the road, and yet were only\r\nhalfway across the desert. Every day had been exactly like the day\r\nbefore--an endless routine of eating and sleeping, camp-making and\r\ncamp-breaking in sun, rain, or wind. The monotony of it all would\r\nbe appalling to a westerner, but the Oriental mind seems peculiarly\r\nadapted to accept it with entire contentment. Long before daylight they\r\nwere on the road again, and when we awoke only the smoking embers of an\r\n_argul_ fire remained as evidence that they ever had been there.\r\n\r\nMongolia, as we saw it in the spring, was very different from Mongolia\r\nof the early autumn. The hills and plains stretched away in limitless\r\nwaves of brown untinged by the slightest trace of green, and in shaded\r\ncorners among rocks there were still patches of snow or ice. Instead\r\nof resembling the grassy plains of Kansas or Nebraska, now it was like\r\na real desert and I had difficulty in justifying to Yvette and Mac my\r\nglowing accounts of its potential resources.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the human life was just as disappointing as the lack of\r\nvegetation, for we were \"between seasons\" on the trail. The winter\r\ntraffic was almost ended, and the camels would not be replaced by cart\r\ncaravans until the grass was long enough to provide adequate food for\r\noxen and horses. The _yurts_, which often are erected far out upon the\r\nplains away from water when snow is on the ground, had all been moved\r\nnear the wells or to the summer pastures; and sometimes we traveled a\r\nhundred miles without a glimpse of even a solitary Mongol.\r\n\r\nUde had been left far behind, and we were bowling along on a road as\r\nlevel as a floor, when we saw two wolves quietly watching us half a\r\nmile away. We had agreed not to chase antelope again; but wolves were\r\nfair game at any time. Moreover, we were particularly glad to be able\r\nto check our records as to how fast a wolf can run when conditions are\r\nin its favor. Coltman signaled Mac to await us with the others, and we\r\nswung toward the animals which were trotting slowly westward, now and\r\nthen stopping to look back as though reluctant to leave such an unusual\r\nexhibition as the car was giving them. A few moments later, however,\r\nthey decided that curiosity might prove dangerous and began to run in\r\nearnest.\r\n\r\nThey separated almost immediately, and we raced after the larger of\r\nthe two, a huge fellow with rangy legs which carried him forward in\r\na long, swinging lope. The ground was perfect for the car, and the\r\nspeedometer registered forty miles an hour. He had a thousand-yard\r\nstart, but we gained rapidly, and I estimated that he never reached a\r\ngreater speed than thirty miles an hour. Charles was very anxious to\r\nkill the brute from the motor with his .45 caliber automatic pistol,\r\nand I promised not to shoot.\r\n\r\nThe wolf was running low to the ground, his head a little to one side\r\nwatching us with one bloodshot eye. He was giving us a great race, but\r\nthe odds were all against him, and finally we had him right beside the\r\nmotor. Leaning far out, Coltman fired quickly. The bullet struck just\r\nbehind the brute, and he swerved sharply, missing the right front wheel\r\nby a scant six inches. Before Charles could turn the car he had gained\r\nthree hundred yards, but we reached him again in little more than a\r\nmile. As Coltman was about to shoot a second time, the wolf suddenly\r\ndropped from sight. Almost on the instant the car plunged over a bank\r\nfour feet in height, landed with a tremendous shock--and kept on!\r\nCharles had seen the danger in a flash, and had thrown his body against\r\nthe wheel to hold it steady. Had he not been an expert driver we should\r\ninevitably have turned upside down and probably all would have been\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nWe stopped an instant to inspect the springs, but by a miracle not a\r\nleaf was broken. The wolf halted, too, and we could see him standing on\r\na gentle rise with drooping head, his gray sides heaving. He seemed to\r\nbe \"all in,\" but to our amazement he was off again like the wind even\r\nbefore the car had started. During the last three miles the ground had\r\nbeen changing rapidly, and we soon reached a stony plain where there\r\nwas imminent danger of smashing a front wheel. The wolf was heading\r\ndirectly toward a rocky slope which lay against the sky like the spiny\r\nback of some gigantic monster of the past.\r\n\r\nHis strategy had almost won the race. For a moment the wolf rested on\r\nthe ridge, and I leaped out to shoot, but instantly he dropped behind\r\nthe bowlders. Leaving me to intercept the animal, Charles swung behind\r\nthe ridge only to run at full speed into a sandy pocket. The motor\r\nceased to throb, and the race was ended.\r\n\r\nThese wolves are sneaking carrion-feeders and as such I detest them,\r\nbut this one had \"played the game.\" _For twelve long miles_ he had kept\r\ndoggedly at his work without a whimper or a cry of \"kamerad.\" The brute\r\nhad outgeneraled us completely, had won by strategy and magnificent\r\nendurance. Whatever he supposed the roaring car to be, instinct told\r\nhim that safety lay among the rocks and he led us there as straight as\r\nan arrow's flight.\r\n\r\nThe animal seemed to take an almost human enjoyment in the way we had\r\nbeen tricked, for he stood on a hillside half a mile away watching\r\nour efforts to extricate the car. We were in a bad place, and it was\r\nevident that the only method of escape was to remove all the baggage\r\nwhich was tied to the running boards. Spreading our fur sleeping bags\r\nupon the sand, we pushed and lifted the automobile to firm ground after\r\nan hour of strenuous work. Hardly had we started back to the road, when\r\nCharles suddenly clapped both hands to his face yelling, \"My Lord, I'm\r\nburning up. What is it? I'm all on fire.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Coltman pulled his hands away, revealing his face covered with\r\nblotches and rising blisters. At the same moment Yvette and I felt a\r\nshower of liquid fire stinging our hands and necks. We leaped out of\r\nthe car just as another blast swept back upon us. Then Charles shouted,\r\n\"I know. It's the Delco plant,\" and dived toward the front mud guard.\r\nSure enough, the cover had been displaced from one of the batteries,\r\nand little pools of sulphuric acid had formed on the leather casings.\r\nThe wind was blowing half a gale, and each gust showered us with drops\r\nof colorless liquid which bit like tiny, living coals.\r\n\r\nIn less than ten seconds I had slashed the ropes and the batteries\r\nwere lying on the ground, but the acid had already done its work most\r\nthoroughly. The duffle sacks containing all our field clothes had\r\nreceived a liberal dose, and during the summer Yvette was kept busy\r\npatching shirts and trousers. I never would have believed that a little\r\nacid could go so far. Even garments in the very center of the sacks\r\nwould suddenly disintegrate when we put them on, and the Hutukhtu and\r\nhis electric plant were \"blessed\" many times before we left Mongolia.\r\n\r\nPLATE V\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONGOL HORSEMEN ON THE STREETS OF URGA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRISON AT URGA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CRIMINAL IN A COFFIN WITH HANDS MANACLED]\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the road, Mrs. Mac was sitting disconsolately in a car\r\nbeside the servants. We had been gone nearly three hours and the poor\r\ngirl was frantic with anxiety. Mac and Owen had followed our tracks in\r\nanother motor, and arrived thirty minutes later. Mac's happy face was\r\ndrawn and white.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't go through that experience again for all the money in\r\nMongolia,\" he said. \"We followed your tracks and at every hill expected\r\nto find you dead on the other side and the car upside down. How on\r\nearth did you miss capsizing when you went over that bank?\"\r\n\r\nAt Turin we found Mr. and Mrs. Mamen camped near the telegraph station\r\nawaiting our arrival. The first cry was \"Food! Food!\" and two loaves of\r\nRussian bread which they had brought from Urga vanished in less than\r\nfifteen minutes. After taking several hundred feet of \"movie\" film at\r\nthe monastery, we ran on northward over a road which was as smooth\r\nand hard as a billiard table. The Turin plain was alive with game;\r\nmarmots, antelope, hares, bustards, geese, and cranes seemed to have\r\nconcentrated there as though in a vast zoölogical garden, and we had\r\nsome splendid shooting. But as Yvette and I spent two glorious months\r\non this same plain, I will tell in future chapters how, in long morning\r\nhorseback rides and during silent starlit nights, we learned to know\r\nand love it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE SACRED CITY OF THE LIVING BUDDHA\r\n\r\n\r\nFar up in northern Mongolia, where the forests stretch in an unbroken\r\nline to the Siberian frontier, lies Urga, the Sacred City of the Living\r\nBuddha. The world has other sacred cities, but none like this. It is\r\na relic of medieval times overlaid with a veneer of twentieth-century\r\ncivilization; a city of violent contrasts and glaring anachronisms.\r\nMotor cars pass camel caravans fresh from the vast, lone spaces of the\r\nGobi Desert; holy lamas, in robes of flaming red or brilliant yellow,\r\nwalk side by side with black-gowned priests; and swarthy Mongol women,\r\nin the fantastic headdress of their race, stare wonderingly at the\r\nlatest fashions of their Russian sisters.\r\n\r\nWe came to Urga from the south. All day we had been riding over\r\nrolling, treeless uplands, and late in the afternoon we had halted on\r\nthe summit of a hill overlooking the Tola River valley. Fifteen miles\r\naway lay Urga, asleep in the darkening shadow of the Bogdo-ol (God's\r\nMountain). An hour later the road led us to our first surprise in\r\nMai-ma-cheng, the Chinese quarter of the city. Years of wandering in\r\nthe strange corners of the world had left us totally unprepared for\r\nwhat we saw. It seemed that here in Mongolia we had discovered an\r\nAmerican frontier outpost of the Indian fighting days. Every house and\r\nshop was protected by high stockades of unpeeled timbers, and there\r\nwas hardly a trace of Oriental architecture save where a temple roof\r\ngleamed above the palisades.\r\n\r\nBefore we were able to adjust our mental perspective we had passed from\r\ncolonial America into a hamlet of modern Russia. Gayly painted cottages\r\nlined the road, and, unconsciously, I looked for a white church with\r\ngilded cupolas. The church was not in sight, but its place was taken by\r\na huge red building of surpassing ugliness, the Russian Consulate. It\r\nstands alone on the summit of a knoll, the open plains stretching away\r\nbehind it to the somber masses of the northern forests. In its imposing\r\nproportions it is tangible evidence of the Russian Colossus which not\r\nmany years ago dominated Urga and all that is left of the ancient\r\nempire of the Khans.\r\n\r\nFor two miles the road is bordered by Russian cottages; then it\r\ndebouches into a wide square which loses its distinctive character\r\nand becomes an indescribable mixture of Russia, Mongolia, and China.\r\nPalisaded compounds, gay with fluttering prayer flags, ornate houses,\r\nfelt-covered _yurts_, and Chinese shops mingle in a dizzying chaos of\r\nconflicting personalities. Three great races have met in Urga and each\r\ncarries on, in this far corner of Mongolia, its own customs and way of\r\nlife. The Mongol _yurt_ has remained unchanged; the Chinese shop, with\r\nits wooden counter and blue-gowned inmates, is pure Chinese; and the\r\nornate cottages proclaim themselves to be only Russian.\r\n\r\nBut on the street my wife and I could never forget that we were in\r\nMongolia. We never tired of wandering through the narrow alleys, with\r\ntheir tiny native shops, or of watching the ever-changing crowds.\r\nMongols in half a dozen different tribal dresses, Tibetan pilgrims,\r\nManchu Tartars, or camel drivers from far Turkestan drank and ate and\r\ngambled with Chinese from civilized Peking.\r\n\r\nThe barbaric splendor of the native dress fairly makes one gasp for\r\nbreath. Besides gowns and sashes of dazzling brilliance, the men wear\r\non their heads all the types of covering one learned to know in the\r\npictures of ancient Cathay, from the high-peaked hat of yellow and\r\nblack--through the whole, strange gamut--to the helmet with streaming\r\npeacock plumes. But were I to tell about them all I would leave none of\r\nmy poor descriptive phrases for the women.\r\n\r\nIt is hopeless to draw a word-picture of a Mongol woman. A photograph\r\nwill help, but to be appreciated she must be seen in all her colors.\r\nTo begin with the dressing of her hair. If all the women of the Orient\r\ncompeted to produce a strange and fantastic type, I do not believe that\r\nthey could excel what the Mongol matrons have developed by themselves.\r\n\r\nTheir hair is plaited over a frame into two enormous flat bands, curved\r\nlike the horns of a mountain sheep and reënforced with bars of wood or\r\nsilver. Each horn ends in a silver plaque, studded with bits of colored\r\nglass or stone, and supports a pendent braid like a riding quirt. On\r\nher head, between the horns, she wears a silver cap elaborately chased\r\nand flashing with \"jewels.\" Surmounting this is a \"saucer\" hat of black\r\nand yellow. Her skirt is of gorgeous brocade or cloth, and the jacket\r\nis of like material with prominent \"puffs\" upon the shoulders. She\r\nwears huge leather boots with upturned, pointed toes, similar to those\r\nof the men, and when in full array she has a whole portière of beadwork\r\nsuspended from the region of her ears.\r\n\r\nShe is altogether satisfying to the lover of fantastic Oriental\r\ncostumes, except in the matter of footgear, and this slight exception\r\nmight be allowed, for she has so amply decorated every other available\r\npart of her anatomy.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the boots form a very necessary adjunct to her personal\r\nequipment, besides providing a covering for her feet. They are many\r\nsizes too large, of course, but they furnish ample space during the\r\nbitter cold of winter for the addition of several pairs of socks,\r\nvarying in number according to the thermometer. During the summer she\r\noften wears no socks at all, but their place is taken by an assortment\r\nof small articles which cannot be carried conveniently on her person.\r\nHer pipe and tobacco, a package of tea, or a wooden bowl can easily be\r\nstuffed into the wide top boots, for pockets are an unknown luxury even\r\nto the men.\r\n\r\nIn its kaleidoscopic mass of life and color the city is like a great\r\npageant on the stage of a theater, with the added fascination of\r\nreality. But, somehow, I could never quite make myself believe that\r\nit was real when a brilliant group of horsemen in pointed, yellow hats\r\nand streaming, peacock feathers dashed down the street. It seemed\r\ntoo impossible that I, a wandering naturalist of the drab, prosaic\r\ntwentieth century, and my American wife were really a living, breathing\r\npart of this strange drama of the Orient.\r\n\r\nBut there was one point of contact which we had with this dream-life\r\nof the Middle Ages. Yvette and I both love horses, and the way to a\r\nMongol's heart is through his pony. Once on horseback we began to\r\nidentify ourselves with the fascinating life around us. We lost the\r\nuncomfortable sense of being merely spectators in the Urga theatricals,\r\nand forgot that we had come to the holy city by means of a very\r\nunromantic motor car.\r\n\r\nWe remained at Urga for ten days while preparations were under way\r\nfor our first trip to the plains, and returned to it often during the\r\nsummer. We came to know it well, and each time we rode down the long\r\nstreet it seemed more wonderful that, in these days of commerce, Urga,\r\nand in fact all Mongolia, could have existed throughout the centuries\r\nwith so little change.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, no lack of modern influence in the sacred city,\r\nbut as yet it is merely a veneer which has been lightly superimposed\r\nupon its ancient civilization, leaving almost untouched the basic\r\ncustoms of its people. This has been due to the remoteness of Mongolia.\r\nUntil a few years ago, when motor cars first made their way across the\r\nseven hundred miles of plains, the only access from the south was by\r\ncamel caravan, and the monotonous trip offered little inducement to\r\ncasual travelers. The Russians came to Urga from the north and, until\r\nthe recent war, their influence was paramount along the border. They\r\nwere by no means anxious to have other foreigners exploit Mongolia, and\r\nthey wished especially to keep the country as a buffer-state between\r\nthemselves and China.\r\n\r\nNot only is Urga the capital of Mongolia and the only city of\r\nconsiderable size in the entire country but it is also the residence\r\nof the Hutukhtu, or Living Buddha, the head of both the Church and the\r\nState. Across the valley his palaces nestle close against the base of\r\nthe Bogdo-ol (God's Mountain), which rises in wooded slopes from the\r\nriver to an elevation of eleven thousand feet above sea level.\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Mountain is a vast game preserve, which is patrolled by two\r\nthousand lamas, and every approach is guarded by a temple or a camp of\r\npriests. Great herds of elk, roebuck, boar, and other animals roam the\r\nforests, but to shoot within the sacred precincts would mean almost\r\ncertain death for the transgressor. Some years ago several Russians\r\nfrom Urga made their way up the mountain during the night and killed\r\na bear. They were brought back in chains by a mob of frenzied lamas.\r\nAlthough the hunters had been beaten nearly to death, it required all\r\nthe influence of the Russian diplomatic agent to save what remained of\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nThe Bogdo-ol extends for twenty-five miles along the Tola Valley,\r\nshutting off Urga from the rolling plains to the south. Like a gigantic\r\nguardian of the holy city at its base, it stands as the only obstacle\r\nto the wireless station which is soon to be erected.\r\n\r\nThe Hutukhtu has three palaces on the banks of the Tola River. One of\r\nthem is a hideous thing, built in Russian style. The other two at least\r\nhave the virtue of native architecture. In the main palace the central\r\nstructure is white with gilded cupolas, and smaller pavilions at the\r\nside have roofs of green. The whole is surrounded by an eight-foot\r\nstockade of white posts trimmed with red.\r\n\r\nThe Hutukhtu seldom leaves his palace now, for he is old and sick and\r\nalmost blind. Many strange stories are told of the mysterious \"Living\r\nGod\" which tend to show him \"as of the earth earthy.\" It is said that\r\nin former days he sometimes left his \"heaven\" to revel with convivial\r\nforeigners in Urga; but all this is gossip and we are discussing a very\r\nsaintly person. His passion for Occidental trinkets and inventions\r\nis well known, however, and his palace is a veritable storehouse for\r\ngramophones, typewriters, microscopes, sewing machines, and a host of\r\nother things sold to him by Russian traders and illustrated in picture\r\ncatalogues sent from the uttermost corners of the world. But like a\r\nchild he soon tires of his toys and throws them aside. He has a motor\r\ncar, but he never rides in it. It has been reported that his chief use\r\nfor the automobile is to attach a wire to its batteries and give his\r\nministers an electric shock; for all Mongols love a practical joke, and\r\nthe Hutukhtu is no exception.\r\n\r\nNow his palace is wired for electricity, and a great arc light\r\nilluminates the courtyard. One evening Mr. Lucander and Mr. Mamen, who\r\nsold the electric plant to the Hutukhtu, were summoned to the palace to\r\nreceive payment. They witnessed a scene which to-day could be possible\r\nonly in Mongolia. Several thousand dollars in silver were brought\r\noutside to their motor car, and the lama, who paid the bills, insisted\r\nthat they count it in his presence.\r\n\r\nA great crowd of Mongols had gathered near the palace and at last a\r\nlong rope was let out from one of the buildings. Kneeling, the Mongols\r\nreverently touched the rope, which was gently waggled from the other\r\nend, supposedly by the Hutukhtu. A barbaric monotone of chanted prayers\r\narose from the kneeling suppliants, and the rope was waggled again.\r\nThen the Mongols rode away, silent with awe at having been blessed\r\nby the Living God. All this under a blazing electric light beside an\r\nautomobile at the foot of the Bogdo-ol!\r\n\r\nThe Hutukhtu seemed to feel that it became his station as a ruling\r\nmonarch to have a foreign house with foreign furniture. Of course he\r\nnever intended to live in it, but other kings had useless palaces\r\nand why shouldn't he? Therefore, a Russian atrocity of red brick was\r\nerected a half mile or so from his other dwellings. The furnishing\r\nbecame a matter of moment, and Mr. Lucander, who was temporarily in\r\nthe employ of the Mongolian Government, was intrusted with the task\r\nof attending to the intimate details. The selection of a bed was most\r\nimportant, for even Living Buddhas have to sleep sometimes--they\r\ncannot always be blessing adoring subjects or playing jokes on their\r\nministers of state. With considerable difficulty a foreign bed was\r\npurchased and brought across the seven hundred miles of plains and\r\ndesert to the red brick palace on the banks of the Tola River.\r\n\r\nMr. Lucander superintended its installation in the Hutukhtu's boudoir\r\nand himself turned chambermaid. As this was the first time he had\r\never made a bed for a Living God, he arranged the spotless sheets and\r\nturned down the covers with the greatest care. When all was done to\r\nhis satisfaction he reported to one of the Hutukhtu's ministers that\r\nthe bed was ready. Two lamas, high dignitaries of the church, were\r\nthe inspection committee. They agreed that it _looked_ all right, but\r\nthe question was, how did it _feel?_ Mr. Lucander waxed eloquent on\r\nthe \"springiness\" of the springs, and assured them that no bed could\r\nbe better; that this was the bed _par excellence_ of all the beds\r\nin China. The lamas held a guttural consultation and then announced\r\nthat before the bed could be accepted it must be tested. Therefore,\r\nwithout more ado, each lama in his dirty boots and gown laid his\r\nunwashed self upon the bed, and bounced up and down. The result was\r\nsatisfactory--except to Lucander and the sheets.\r\n\r\nAlthough to foreign eyes and in the cold light of modernity the\r\nHutukhtu and his government cut a somewhat ridiculous figure, the\r\nreverse of the picture is the pathetic death struggle of a once\r\nglorious race. I have said that unaccustomed luxury was responsible for\r\nthe decline of the Mongol Empire, but the ruin of the race was due to\r\nthe Lama Church. Lamaism, which was introduced from Tibet, gained its\r\nhold not long after the time of Kublai Khan's death in 1295. Previous\r\nto this the Mongols had been religious liberals, but eventually Lamaism\r\nwas made the religion of the state. It is a branch of the Buddhist\r\ncult, and its teachings are against war and violent death.\r\n\r\nBy custom one or more sons of every family are dedicated to the\r\npriesthood, and as Lamaism requires its priests to be celibate, the\r\nbirth rate is low. To-day there are only a few million Mongols in a\r\ncountry half as large as the United States (exclusive of Alaska), a\r\ngreat proportion of the male population being lamas. With no education,\r\nexcept in the books of their sect, they lead a lazy, worthless\r\nexistence, supported by the lay population and by the money they\r\nextract by preying upon the superstitions of their childlike brothers.\r\nWere Lamaism abolished there still would be hope for Mongolia under a\r\nproper government, for the Mongols of to-day are probably the equals of\r\nGenghis Khan's warriors in strength, endurance, and virility.\r\n\r\nThe religion of Mongolia is like that of Tibet and the Dalai Lama of\r\nLhassa is the head of the entire Church. The Tashi Lama residing at\r\nTashilumpo, also in Tibet, ranks second. The Hutukhtu of Mongolia is\r\nthird in the Lama hierarchy, bearing the title _Cheptsundampa Hutukhtu_\r\n(Venerable Best Saint). According to ancient tradition, the Hutukhtu\r\nnever dies; his spirit simply reappears in the person of some newly\r\nborn infant and thus comes forth reëmbodied. The names of infants, who\r\nhave been selected as possible candidates for the honor, are written\r\nupon slips of paper incased in rolls of paste and deposited in a golden\r\nurn. The one which is drawn is hailed as the new incarnation.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the eyesight of the Hutukhtu began to fail, and a great\r\ntemple was erected as a sacrifice to appease the gods. It stands on\r\na hill at the western end of Urga, surrounded by the tiny wooden\r\ndwellings of the priests. \"The Lama City\" it is called, for only those\r\nin the service of the Church are allowed to live within its sacred\r\nprecincts. In the temple itself there is an eighty-foot bronze image of\r\nBuddha standing on a golden lotus flower. The great figure is heavily\r\ngilded, incrusted with precious stones, and draped with silken cloths.\r\n\r\nI was fortunate in being present one day when the temple was opened\r\nto women and the faithful in the city. Somewhat doubtful as to my\r\nreception, I followed the crowd as it filed through an outer pavilion\r\nbetween a double row of kneeling lamas in high-peaked hats and robes\r\nof flaming yellow. I carried my hat in my hand and tried to wear\r\na becoming expression of humility and reverence. It was evidently\r\nsuccessful, for I passed unhindered into the Presence. At the entrance\r\nstood a priest who gave me, with the others, a few drops of holy water\r\nfrom a filthy jug. Silent with awe, the people bathed their faces with\r\nthe precious fluid and prostrated themselves before the gigantic figure\r\nstanding on the golden lotus blossom, its head lost in the shadows of\r\nthe temple roof. They kissed its silken draperies, soiled by the lips\r\nof other thousands, and each one gathered a handful of sacred dirt from\r\nthe temple floor. From niches in the walls hundreds of tiny Buddhas\r\ngazed impassively on the worshiping Mongols.\r\n\r\nPLATE VI\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT TEMPLE AT URGA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PRAYER WHEEL AND A MONGOL LAMA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAMAS CALLING THE GODS AT A TEMPLE IN URGA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONGOL PRAYING AT A SHRINE IN URGA]\r\n\r\nThe scene was intoxicating in its barbaric splendor. The women in their\r\nfantastic headdresses and brilliant gowns; the blazing yellow robes\r\nof the kneeling lamas; and the chorus of prayers which rose and fell\r\nin a meaningless half-wild chant broken by the clash of cymbals and\r\nthe boom of drums--all this set the blood leaping in my veins. There\r\nwas a strange dizziness in my head, and I had an almost overpowering\r\ndesire to fall on my knees with the Mongols and join in the chorus of\r\nadoration. The subtle smell of burning incense, the brilliant colors,\r\nand the barbaric music were like an intoxicating drink which inflamed\r\nthe senses but dulled the brain. It was then that I came nearest\r\nto understanding the religious fanaticism of the East. Even with a\r\nbackground of twentieth-century civilization I felt its sensuous power.\r\nWhat wonder that it has such a hold on a simple, uneducated people, fed\r\non superstition from earliest childhood and the religious traditions of\r\nseven hundred years!\r\n\r\nThe service ended abruptly in a roar of sound. Rising to their feet,\r\nthe people streamed into the courtyard to whirl the prayer wheels about\r\nthe temple's base. Each wheel is a hollow cylinder of varying size,\r\nstanding on end, and embellished with Tibetan characters in gold. The\r\nwheels are sometimes filled with thousands of slips of paper upon which\r\nis written a prayer or a sacred thought, and each revolution adds to\r\nthe store of merit in the future life.\r\n\r\nThe Mongol goes farther still in accumulating virtue, and every native\r\nhouse in Urga is gay with fluttering bits of cloth or paper on which\r\na prayer is written. Each time the little flag moves in the wind it\r\nsends forth a supplication for the welfare of the Mongol's spirit in\r\nthe Buddhistic heaven. Not only are the prayer wheels found about the\r\ntemples, but they line the streets, and no visiting Mongol need be\r\ndeprived of trying the virtue of a new device without going to a place\r\nof worship. He can give a whirl or two to half a dozen within a hundred\r\nyards of where he buys his tea or sells his sheep.\r\n\r\nOn every hand there is constant evidence that Urga is a sacred city. It\r\nnever can be forgotten even for a moment. The golden roofs of scores of\r\ntemples give back the sunlight, and the moaning chant of praying lamas\r\nis always in the air. Even in the main street I have seen the prostrate\r\nforms of ragged pilgrims who have journeyed far to this Mecca of the\r\nlama faith. If they are entering the city for the first time and crave\r\nexceeding virtue, they approach the great temple on the hill by lying\r\nface down at every step and beating their foreheads upon the ground.\r\nWooden shrines of dazzling whiteness stand in quiet streets or cluster\r\nby themselves behind the temples. In front of each, raised slightly at\r\none end, is a prayer board worn, black and smooth by the prostrated\r\nbodies of worshiping Mongols.\r\n\r\nAlthough the natives take such care for the repose of the spirit in\r\nafter life, they have a strong distaste for the body from which the\r\nspirit has fled and they consider it a most undesirable thing to have\r\nabout the house. The stigma is imposed even upon the dying. In Urga a\r\nfamily of Mongols had erected their _yurt_ in the courtyard of one of\r\nour friends. During the summer the young wife became very ill, and when\r\nher husband was convinced that she was about to die he moved the poor\r\ncreature bodily out of the _yurt_. She could die if she wished, but it\r\nmust not be inside his house.\r\n\r\nThe corpse itself is considered unclean and the abode of evil spirits,\r\nand as such must be disposed of as quickly as possible. Sometimes the\r\nwhole family will pack up their _yurt_ and decamp at once, leaving the\r\nbody where it lies. More usually the corpse is loaded upon a cart which\r\nis driven at high speed over a bit of rough ground. The body drops off\r\nat some time during the journey, but the driver does not dare look\r\nback until he is sure that the unwelcome burden is no longer with him;\r\notherwise he might anger the spirit following the corpse and thereby\r\ncause himself and his family unending trouble. Unlike the Chinese, who\r\ntreat their dead with the greatest respect and go to enormous expense\r\nin the burial, every Mongol knows that his coffin will be the stomachs\r\nof dogs, wolves, or birds. Indeed, the Chinese name for the raven is\r\nthe \"Mongol's coffin.\"\r\n\r\nThe first day we camped in Urga, my wife and Mrs. MacCallie were\r\nwalking beside the river. Only a short distance from our tent they\r\ndiscovered a dead Mongol who had just been dragged out of the city. A\r\npack of dogs were in the midst of their feast and the sight was most\r\nunpleasant.\r\n\r\nThe dogs of Mongolia are savage almost beyond belief. They are huge\r\nblack fellows like the Tibetan mastiff, and their diet of dead human\r\nflesh seems to have given them a contempt for living men. Every Mongol\r\nfamily has one or more, and it is exceedingly dangerous for a man to\r\napproach a _yurt_ or caravan unless he is on horseback or has a pistol\r\nready. In Urga itself you will probably be attacked if you walk unarmed\r\nthrough the meat market at night. I have never visited Constantinople,\r\nbut if the Turkish city can boast of more dogs than Urga, it must be\r\nan exceedingly disagreeable place in which to dwell. Although the dogs\r\nlive to a large extent upon human remains, they are also fed by the\r\nlamas. Every day about four o'clock in the afternoon you can see a cart\r\nbeing driven through the main street, followed by scores of yelping\r\ndogs. On it are two or more dirty lamas with a great barrel from which\r\nthey ladle out refuse for the dogs, for according to their religious\r\nbeliefs they accumulate great merit for themselves if they prolong the\r\nlife of anything, be it bird, beast, or insect.\r\n\r\nIn the river valley, just below the Lama City, numbers of dogs can\r\nalways be found, for the dead priests usually are thrown there to be\r\ndevoured. Dozens of white skulls lie about in the grass, but it is a\r\nserious matter even to touch one. I very nearly got into trouble one\r\nday by targeting my rifle upon a skull which lay two or three hundred\r\nyards away from our tent.\r\n\r\nThe customs of the Mongols are not all as gruesome as those I have\r\ndescribed, yet Urga is essentially a frontier city where life is seen\r\nin the raw. Its natives are a hard-living race, virile beyond compare.\r\nChildren of the plains, they are accustomed to privation and fatigue.\r\nTheir law is the law of the northland:\r\n\r\n    \".... That only the Strong shall thrive,\r\n    That surely the Weak shall perish and only the Fit survive.\"\r\n\r\nIn the careless freedom of his magnificent horsemanship a Mongol seems\r\nas much an untamed creature of the plains as does the eagle itself\r\nwhich soars above his _yurt_. Independence breathes in every movement;\r\neven in his rough good humor and in the barbaric splendor of the native\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nBut the little matter of cleanliness is of no importance in his\r\nscheme of life. When a meal has been eaten, the wooden bowl is licked\r\nclean with the tongue; it is seldom washed. Every man and woman\r\nusually carries through life the bodily dirt which has accumulated in\r\nchildhood, unless it is removed by some accident or by the wear of\r\nyears. One can be morally certain that it will never be washed off by\r\ndesign or water. Perhaps the native is not altogether to blame, for,\r\nexcept in the north, water is not abundant. It can be found on the\r\nplains and in the Gobi Desert only at wells and an occasional pond, and\r\non the march it is too precious to be wasted in the useless process\r\nof bathing. Moreover, from September until May the bitter winds which\r\nsweep down from the Siberian steppes furnish an unpleasant temperature\r\nin which to take a bath.\r\n\r\nThe Mongol's food consists almost entirely of mutton, cheese, and tea.\r\nLike all northern people, he needs an abundance of fat, and sheep\r\nsupply his wants. There is always more or less grease distributed about\r\nhis clothes and person, and when Mongols are _en masse_ the odor of\r\nmutton and unwashed humanity is well-nigh overpowering.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must admit that in morality the Mongol is but little better off than\r\nin personal cleanliness. A man may have only one lawful wife, but may\r\nkeep as many concubines as his means allow, all of whom live with the\r\nmembers of the family in the single room of the _yurt_. Adultery is\r\nopenly practiced, apparently without prejudice to either party, and\r\npolyandry is not unusual in the more remote parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Mongol is _unmoral_ rather than immoral. He lives like an untaught\r\nchild of nature and the sense of modesty or decency, as we conceive it,\r\ndoes not enter into his scheme of life. But the operation of natural\r\nlaws, which in the lower animals are successful in maintaining the\r\nspecies, is fatally impaired by the loose family relations which tend\r\nto spread disease. Unless Lamaism is abolished I can see little hope\r\nfor the rejuvenation of the race.\r\n\r\nIn writing of Urga's inhabitants and their way of life I am neglecting\r\nthe city itself. I have already told of the great temple on the hill\r\nand its clustering lama houses which overlook and dominate the river\r\nvalley. Its ornate roof, flashing in the sun, can be seen for many\r\nmiles, like a religious beacon guiding the steps of wandering pilgrims\r\nto the Mecca of their faith.\r\n\r\nAt the near end of the broad street below the Lama City is the tent\r\nmarket, and just beyond it are the black-smith shops where bridles,\r\ncooking pots, tent pegs, and all the equipment essential to a wandering\r\nlife on the desert can be purchased in an hour--if you have the price!\r\nNothing is cheap in Urga, with the exception of horses, and when we\r\nbegan to outfit for our trip on the plains we received a shock similar\r\nto that which I had a month ago in New York, when I paid twenty dollars\r\nfor a pair of shoes. We ought to be hardened to it now, but when we\r\nwere being robbed in Urga by profiteering Chinese, who sell flour at\r\nten and twelve dollars a sack and condensed milk at seventy-five cents\r\na tin, we roared and grumbled--and paid the price! I vowed I would\r\nnever pay twenty dollars for a pair of shoes at home, but roaring and\r\ngrumbling is no more effective in procuring shoes in New York than it\r\nwas in obtaining flour and milk in Urga.\r\n\r\nWe paid in Russian rubles, then worth three cents each. (In former\r\nyears a ruble equaled more than half a dollar.) Eggs were well-nigh\r\nnonexistent, except those which had made their way up from China over\r\nthe long caravan trail and were guaranteed to be \"addled\"--or whatever\r\nit is that sometimes makes an egg an unpleasant companion at the\r\nbreakfast table. Even those cost three rubles each! Only a few Russians\r\nown chickens in Urga and their productions are well-nigh \"golden\r\neggs,\" for grain is very scarce and it takes an astounding number of\r\nrubles to buy a bushel.\r\n\r\nFortunately we had sent most of our supplies and equipment to Urga by\r\ncaravan during the winter, but there were a good many odds and ends\r\nneeded to fill our last requirements, and we came to know the ins and\r\nouts of the sacred city intimately before we were ready to leave for\r\nthe plains. The Chinese shops were our real help, for in Urga, as\r\neverywhere else in the Orient, the Chinese are the most successful\r\nmerchants. Some firms have accumulated considerable wealth and the\r\nChinaman does not hesitate to exact the last cent of profit when\r\ntrading with the Mongols.\r\n\r\nAt the eastern end of Urga's central street, which is made picturesque\r\nby gayly painted prayer wheels and alive with a moving throng of\r\nbrilliant horsemen, are the Custom House and the Ministry of Foreign\r\nAffairs. The former is at the far end of an enormous compound filled\r\nwith camel caravans or loaded carts. There is a more or less useless\r\nwooden building, but the business is conducted in a large _yurt_,\r\nhard against the compound wall. It was an extraordinary contrast to\r\nsee a modern filing-cabinet at one end and a telephone box on the\r\nfelt-covered framework of the _yurt_.\r\n\r\nNot far beyond the Custom House is what I believe to be one of the most\r\nhorrible prisons in the world. Inside a double palisade of unpeeled\r\ntimbers is a space about ten feet square upon which open the doors of\r\nsmall rooms, almost dark. In these dungeons are piled wooden boxes,\r\nfour feet long by two and one-half feet high. These coffins are the\r\nprisoners' cells.\r\n\r\nSome of the poor wretches have heavy chains about their necks and\r\nboth hands manacled together. They can neither sit erect nor lie at\r\nfull length. Their food, when the jailer remembers to give them any,\r\nis pushed through a six-inch hole in the coffin's side. Some are\r\nimprisoned here for only a few days or weeks; others for life, or for\r\nmany years. Sometimes they lose the use of their limbs, which shrink\r\nand shrivel away. The agony of their cramped position is beyond the\r\npower of words to describe. Even in winter, when the temperature\r\ndrops, as it sometimes does, to sixty degrees below zero, they are\r\ngiven only a single sheepskin for covering. How it is possible to live\r\nin indescribable filth, half-fed, well-nigh frozen in winter, and\r\nsuffering the tortures of the damned, is beyond my ken--only a Mongol\r\ncould live at all.\r\n\r\nThe prison is not a Mongol invention. It was built by the Manchus and\r\nis an eloquent tribute to a knowledge of the fine arts of cruelty that\r\nhas never been surpassed.\r\n\r\nI have given this description of the prison not to feed morbid\r\ncuriosity, but to show that Urga, even if it has a Custom House, a\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, motor cars, and telephones, is still at\r\nheart a city of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nIn Urga we made a delightful and most valuable friend in the person of\r\nMr. F. A. Larsen. Most foreigners speak of him as \"Larsen of Mongolia\"\r\nand indeed it is difficult for us to think of the country without\r\nthinking of the man. Some thirty years ago he rode into Mongolia and\r\nliked it. He liked it so much, in fact, that he dug a well and built a\r\nhouse among the Tabool hills a hundred miles north of Kalgan. At first\r\nhe labored with his wife as a missionary, but later he left that field\r\nto her and took up the work which he loved best in all the world--the\r\nbuying and selling of horses.\r\n\r\nDuring his years of residence in Mongolia hundreds of thousands of\r\nhorses have passed under his appraising eyes and the Mongols respect\r\nhis judgment as they respect the man. I wish that I might write the\r\nstory of his life, for it is more interesting than any novel of romance\r\nor adventure. In almost every recent event of importance to the Mongols\r\nMr. Larsen's name has figured. Time after time he has been sent as\r\nan emissary of the Living Buddha to Peking when misunderstandings or\r\ndisturbances threatened the political peace of Mongolia. Not only does\r\nhe understand the psychology of the natives, but he knows every hill\r\nand plain of their vast plateau as well as do the desert nomads.\r\n\r\nFor some time he had been in charge of Andersen, Meyer's branch at\r\nUrga with Mr. E. W. Olufsen and we made their house our headquarters.\r\nMr. Larsen immediately undertook to obtain an outfit for our work upon\r\nthe plains. He purchased two riding ponies for us from Prince Tze Tze;\r\nhe borrowed two carts with harness from a Russian friend, and bought\r\nanother; he loaned us a riding pony for our Mongol, a cart horse of\r\nhis own, and Mr. Olufsen contributed another. He made our equipment a\r\npersonal matter and he was never too busy to assist us in the smallest\r\ndetails. Moreover, we could spend hours listening to the tales of\r\nhis early life, for his keen sense of humor made him a delightful\r\nstory-teller. One of the most charming aspects of our wandering life is\r\nthe friends we have made in far corners of the world, and for none have\r\nwe a more affectionate regard than for \"Larsen of Mongolia.\"\r\n\r\nPLATE VII\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONGOL WOMEN BESIDE A \"YURT\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HEADDRESS OF A MONGOL MARRIED WOMAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FRAMEWORK OF A YURT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONGOL WOMEN AND A LAMA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE LONG TRAIL TO SAIN NOIN KHAN\r\n\r\n\r\nOur arrival in Urga was in the most approved manner of the twentieth\r\ncentury. We came in motor cars with much odor of gasoline and noise of\r\nhorns. When we left the sacred city we dropped back seven hundred years\r\nand went as the Mongols traveled. Perhaps it was not quite as in the\r\ndays of Genghis Khan, for we had three high-wheeled carts of a Russian\r\nmodel, but they were every bit as springless and uncomfortable as the\r\npalanquins of the ancient emperors.\r\n\r\nOf course, we ourselves did not ride in carts. They were driven by our\r\ncook and the two Chinese taxidermists, each of whom sat on his own\r\nparticular mound of baggage with an air of resignation and despondency.\r\nTheir faces were very long indeed, for the sudden transition from the\r\nback seat of a motor car to a jolting cart did not harmonize with their\r\npreconceived scheme of Mongolian life. But they endured it manfully,\r\nand doubtless it added much to the store of harrowing experience with\r\nwhich they could regale future audiences in civilized Peking.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I were each mounted on a Mongol pony. Mine was called\r\n\"Kublai Khan\" and he deserved the name. Later I shall have much to\r\ntell of this wonderful horse, for I learned to love him as one loves\r\na friend who has endured the \"ordeal by fire\" and has not been found\r\nwanting. My wife's chestnut stallion was a trifle smaller than Kublai\r\nKhan and proved to be a tricky beast whom I could have shot with\r\npleasure. To this day she carries the marks of both his teeth and\r\nhoofs, and we have no interest in his future life. Kublai Khan has\r\nreceived the reward of a sunlit stable in Peking where carrots are in\r\nabundance and sugar is not unknown.\r\n\r\nBesides the three Chinese we had a little Mongol priest, a yellow lama\r\nonly eighteen years of age. We did not hire him for spiritual reasons,\r\nbut to be our guide and social mentor upon the plains. Of course, we\r\ncould not speak Mongol, but both my wife and I know some Chinese and\r\nour cook-boy Lü was possessed of a species of \"pidgin English\" which,\r\nby using a good deal of imagination, we could understand at times.\r\nSince our lama spoke fluent Chinese, he acted as interpreter with the\r\nMongols, and we had no difficulty. It is wonderful how much you can do\r\nwith sign language when you really have to, especially if the other\r\nfellow tries to understand. You always can be sure that the Mongols\r\nwill match your efforts in this respect.\r\n\r\nAn interesting part of our equipment was a Mongol tent which Charles\r\nColtman had had made for us in Kalgan. This is an ingenious adaptation\r\nof the ordinary wall tent, and is especially fitted for work on the\r\nplains. No one should attempt to use any other kind. From the ridgepole\r\nthe sides curve down and out to the ground, presenting a sloping\r\nsurface to the wind at every angle. One corner can be lifted to cause\r\na draft through the door and an open fire can be built in the tent\r\nwithout danger of suffocation from the smoke; moreover, it can be\r\nerected by a single person in ten minutes. We had an American wall tent\r\nalso, but found it such a nuisance that we used it only during bad\r\nweather. In the wind which always blows upon the plains it flapped and\r\nfluttered to such a degree that we could hardly sleep.\r\n\r\nAs every traveler knows, the natives of a country usually have\r\ndeveloped the best possible clothes and dwellings for the peculiar\r\nconditions under which they live. Just as the Mongol felt-covered\r\n_yurt_ and tent are all that can be desired, so do they know that fur\r\nand leather are the only clothing to keep them warm during the bitter\r\nwinter months.\r\n\r\nIn the carts we had an ample supply of flour, bacon, coffee, tea,\r\nsugar, and dried fruit. For meat, we depended upon our guns, of course,\r\nand always had as much as could be used. Although we did not travel _de\r\nluxe_, nevertheless we were entirely comfortable. When a man boasts of\r\nthe way in which he discards even necessaries in the field, you can be\r\nmorally certain that he has not done much real traveling. \"Roughing\r\nit\" does not harmonize well with hard work. One must accept enough\r\ndiscomforts under the best conditions without the addition of any\r\nwhich can be avoided. Good health is the prime requisite in the field.\r\nWithout it you are lost. The only way in which to keep fit and ready\r\nto give every ounce of physical and mental energy to the problems of\r\nthe day is to sleep comfortably, eat wholesome food, and be properly\r\nclothed. It is not often, then, that you will need a doctor. We have\r\nnot as yet had a physician on any of our expeditions, even though we\r\nhave often been very many miles from the nearest white men.\r\n\r\nIt never ceases to amuse me that the insurance companies always cancel\r\nmy accident policies as soon as I leave for the field. The excuse is\r\nthat I am not a \"good risk,\" although they are ready enough to renew\r\nthem when I return to New York. And yet the average person has a\r\nhundred times more chance of being killed or injured right on Fifth\r\nAvenue than do we who live in the open, breathing God's fresh air and\r\nsleeping under the stars. My friend Stefansson, the Arctic explorer,\r\noften says that \"adventures are a mark of incompetence,\" and he is\r\ndoubtless right. If a man goes into the field with a knowledge of the\r\ncountry he is to visit and with a proper equipment, he probably will\r\nhave very few \"adventures.\" If he has not the knowledge and equipment\r\nhe had much better remain at home, for he will inevitably come to grief.\r\n\r\nWe learned from the Mongols that there was a wonderful shooting ground\r\nthree hundred miles southwest of Urga in the country belonging to Sain\r\nNoin Khan. It was a region backed by mountains fifteen thousand feet\r\nin height, inhabited by bighorn sheep and ibex; and antelope were\r\nreported to be numerous upon the plains which merged gradually into the\r\nsandy wastes of the western Gobi where herds of wild horses (_Equus\r\nprjevalski_) and wild asses (_Equus hemionus_) could be found.\r\n\r\nSain Noin, one of the four Mongolian kings, had died only a short time\r\nearlier under suspicious circumstances, and his widow had just visited\r\nthe capital. Monsieur Orlow, the Russian Diplomatic Agent, had written\r\nher regarding our prospective visit, and through him she had extended\r\nto us a cordial invitation.\r\n\r\nOur start from Urga was on a particularly beautiful day, even for\r\nMongolia. The golden roof of the great white temple on the hill blazed\r\nwith light, and the undulating crest of the Sacred Mountain seemed so\r\nnear that we imagined we could see the deer and boar in its parklike\r\nopenings. Our way led across the valley and over the Tola River just\r\nbelow the palace of the Living God. We climbed a long hill and emerged\r\non a sloping plain where marmots were bobbing in and out of their\r\nburrows like toy animals manipulated by a string. Two great flocks of\r\ndemoiselle cranes were daintily catching grasshoppers not a hundred\r\nyards away. We wanted both the cranes for dinner and the marmots for\r\nspecimens, but we dared not shoot. Although not actually upon sacred\r\nsoil we were in close proximity to the Bogdo-ol and a rifle shot might\r\nhave brought a horde of fanatical priests upon our heads. It is best to\r\ntake no chances with religious superstitions, for the lamas do not wait\r\nto argue when they are once aroused.\r\n\r\nThe first day began most beautifully, but it ended badly as all first\r\ndays are apt to do. We met our \"Waterloo\" on a steep hill shortly\r\nafter tiffin, for two of the horses absolutely refused to pull. The\r\nloads were evidently too heavy, and the outlook for the future was not\r\nencouraging. An extract from my wife's journal tells what we did that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"It took two hours to negotiate the hill, and the men were almost\r\nexhausted when the last load reached the summit. Ever since tiffin\r\nthe sky had been growing darker and darker, and great masses of black\r\nclouds gathered about the crest of the Bogdo-ol. Suddenly a vivid\r\nflash of lightning cut the sky as though with a flaming knife, and the\r\nrain came down in a furious beat of icy water. In five minutes we were\r\nsoaked and shivering with cold, so when at last we reached the plain we\r\nturned off the road toward two Mongol _yurts_, which rested beside the\r\nriver a mile away like a pair of great white birds.\r\n\r\n\"Roy and I galloped ahead over the soft, slushy grass, nearly blinded\r\nby the rain, and hobbling our horses outside the nearest _yurt_, went\r\ninside with only the formality of a shout. The room was so dark that\r\nI could hardly see, and the heavy smoke from the open fire burned and\r\nstung our eyes. On the floor sat a frowzy-looking woman, blowing at the\r\nfire, and a yellow lama, his saucer hat hidden under its waterproof\r\ncovering--apparently he was a traveler like ourselves.\r\n\r\n\"The frowzy lady smiled and motioned us to sit down on a low couch\r\nbeside the door. As we did so, I saw a small face peering out of a big\r\nsheepskin coat and two black eyes staring at us unblinkingly. It was a\r\nlittle Mongol girl whose nap had been disturbed by so many visitors.\r\nShe was rather a pretty little thing and so small--just a little older\r\nthan my own baby in Peking--that I wanted to play with her. She was shy\r\nat first, but when I held out a picture advertisement from a package of\r\ncigarettes she gradually edged nearer, encouraged by her mother. Soon\r\nshe was leaning on my knee. Then without taking her black eyes from my\r\nface, she solemnly put one finger in her mouth and jerked it out with\r\na loud 'pop,' much to her mother's gratification. But when she decided\r\nto crawl up into my lap, my interest began to wane, for she exuded such\r\na concentrated 'essence of Mongol' and rancid mutton fat that I was\r\nalmost suffocated.\r\n\r\n\"Our hostess was busy stirring a thick, white soup in a huge cauldron,\r\nand by the time the carts arrived every one was dipping in with their\r\nwooden bowls. We begged to be excused, since we had already had some\r\nexperience with Mongol soup.\r\n\r\n\"The _yurt_ really was not a bad place when we became accustomed to\r\nthe bitter smoke and the combination of native odors. There were two\r\ncouches, about six inches from the ground, covered with sheepskins and\r\nfurs. Opposite the door stood a chest--rather a nice one--on top of\r\nwhich was a tiny god with a candle burning before it, and a photograph\r\nof the Hutukhtu.\"\r\n\r\nWe had dinner in the _yurt_, and the boys slept there while we used our\r\nMongol tent. There was no difficulty in erecting it even in the wind\r\nand rain, but it would have been impossible to have put up the American\r\nwall tent. Even though it was the fifth of June, there was a sharp\r\nfrost during the night, and we were thankful for our fur sleeping bags.\r\n\r\nAlways in Mongolia after a heavy rain the air is crystal-clear, and\r\nwe had a delightful morning beside the river. Hundreds of demoiselle\r\ncranes were feeding in the meadowlike valley bottom where the grass\r\nwas as green as emeralds. We saw two of the graceful birds standing on\r\na sand bar and, as we rode toward them, they showed not the slightest\r\nsign of fear. When we were not more than twenty feet away they walked\r\nslowly about in a circle, and the lama discovered two spotted brown\r\neggs almost under his pony's feet. There was no sign of a nest, but the\r\neggs were perfectly protected by their resemblance to the stones.\r\n\r\nOur way led close along the Tola River, and just before tiffin we saw a\r\nline of camels coming diagonally toward us from behind a distant hill.\r\nI wish you could have seen that caravan in all its barbaric splendor\r\nas it wound across the vivid green plains. Three lamas, dressed in\r\ngorgeous yellow robes, and two, in flaming red, rode ahead on ponies.\r\nThen neck and neck, mounted on enormous camels, came four men in gowns\r\nof rich maroon and a woman flashing with jewels and silver. Behind\r\nthem, nose to tail, was the long, brown line of laden beasts. It was\r\nlike a painting of the Middle Ages--like a picture of the days of\r\nKublai Khan, when the Mongol court was the most splendid the world has\r\never seen. My wife and I were fascinated, for this was the Mongolia of\r\nour dreams.\r\n\r\nBut our second day was not destined to be one of unalloyed happiness,\r\nfor just after luncheon we reached a bad stretch of road alternating\r\nbetween jagged rocks and deep mud holes. The white 'horse, which was\r\nso quickly exhausted the day before, gave up absolutely when its cart\r\nbecame badly mired. Just then a red lama appeared with four led ponies\r\nand said that one of his horses could extricate the cart. He hitched a\r\ntiny brown animal between the shafts, we all put our shoulders to the\r\nwheels, and in ten minutes the load was on solid ground. We at once\r\noffered to trade horses, and by giving a bonus of five dollars I became\r\nthe possessor of the brown pony.\r\n\r\nBut the story does not end there. Two months later when we had returned\r\nto Urga a Mongol came to our camp in great excitement and announced\r\nthat we had one of his horses. He said that five animals had been\r\nstolen from him and that the little brown pony for which I had traded\r\nwith the lama was one of them. His proof was incontrovertible and\r\naccording to the law of the country I was bound to give back the animal\r\nand accept the loss. However, a half dozen hard-riding Mongol soldiers\r\nat once took up the trail of the lama, and the chances are that there\r\nwill be one less thieving priest before the incident is closed.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note how a similarity of conditions in western\r\nAmerica and in Mongolia has developed exactly the same attitude of\r\nmutual protection in regard to horses. In both countries horse-stealing\r\nis considered to be one of the worst crimes. It is punishable by death\r\nin Mongolia or, what is infinitely worse, by a life in one of the\r\nprison coffins. Moreover, the spirit of mutual assistance is carried\r\nfurther, and several times during the summer when our ponies had\r\nstrayed miles from the tents they were brought in by passing Mongols,\r\nor we were told where they could be found.\r\n\r\nOur camp the second night was on a beautiful, grassy plateau beside\r\na tiny stream, a tributary of the river. We put out a line of traps\r\nfor small mammals, but in the morning were disappointed to find only\r\nthree meadow mice (_Microtus_). There were no fresh signs of marmots,\r\nhares, or other animals along the river, and I began to suspect what\r\neventually proved to be true, viz., that the valley was a favorite\r\nwinter camping ground for Mongols, and that all the game had been\r\nkilled or driven far away. Indeed, we had hardly been beyond sight of a\r\n_yurt_ during the entire two days, and great flocks of sheep and goats\r\nwere feeding on every grassy meadow.\r\n\r\nBut the Mongols considered cartridges too precious to waste on\r\nbirds and we saw many different species. The demoiselle cranes were\r\nperforming their mating dances all about us, and while one was chasing\r\na magpie it made the most amusing spectacle, as it hopped and flapped\r\nafter the little black and white bird which kept just out of reach.\r\n\r\nMongolian skylarks were continually jumping out of the grass from\r\nalmost under our horses' feet to soar about our heads, flooding the\r\nair with song. Along the sand banks of the river we saw many flocks of\r\nswan geese (_Cygnopsis cygnoides_). They are splendid fellows with\r\na broad, brown band down the back of the neck, and are especially\r\ninteresting as being the ancestors of the Chinese domestic geese.\r\nThey were not afraid of horses, but left immediately if a man on foot\r\napproached. I killed half a dozen by slipping off my pony, when about\r\ntwo hundred yards away, and walking behind the horses while Yvette rode\r\nboldly toward the flock, leading Kublai Khan. Twice the birds fell\r\nacross the river, and we had to swim for them. My pony took to the\r\nwater like a duck and when we had reached the other bank would arch\r\nhis neck as proudly as though he had killed the bird himself. His keen\r\ninterest in sport, his gentleness, and his intelligence won my heart at\r\nonce. He would let me shoot from his back without the slightest fear,\r\neven though he had never been used as a hunting pony by Prince Tze Tze\r\nfrom whom he had been purchased.\r\n\r\nIn the ponds and among the long marsh grass we found the ruddy\r\nsheldrake (_Casarca casarca_), and the crested lapwing (_Vanellus\r\nvanellus_). They were like old friends, for we had met them first in\r\nfar Yün-nan and on the Burma frontier during the winter of 1916-17\r\nwhence they had gone to escape the northern cold; now they were on\r\ntheir summer breeding grounds. The sheldrakes glowed like molten gold\r\nwhen the sun found them in the grass, and we could not have killed the\r\nbeautiful birds even had we needed them for food. Moreover, like the\r\nlapwings, they had a trusting simplicity, a way of throwing themselves\r\non one's mercy, which was infinitely appealing. We often hunted for\r\nthe eggs of both the sheldrakes and lapwings. They must have been near\r\nby, we knew, for the old birds would fly about our heads uttering\r\nagonizing calls, but we never found the nests.\r\n\r\nI killed four light-gray geese with yellow bills and legs and narrow\r\nbrown bars across the head, and a broad brown stripe down the back of\r\nthe neck. I could only identify the species as the bar-headed goose of\r\nIndia (_Eulabeia indica_), which I was not aware ever traveled so far\r\nnorth to breed. Later I found my identification to be correct, and that\r\nthe bird is an occasional visitor to Mongolia. We saw only one specimen\r\nof the bean goose (_Anser fabalis_), the common bird of China, which I\r\nhad expected would be there in thousands. There were a few mallards,\r\nredheads, and shoveler ducks, and several bustards, besides half a\r\ndozen species of plover and shore birds.\r\n\r\nExcept for these the trip would have been infinitely monotonous, for we\r\nwere bitterly disappointed in the lack of animal life. Moreover, there\r\nwas continual trouble with the carts, and on the third day I had to buy\r\nan extra horse. Although one can purchase a riding pony at any _yurt_,\r\ncart animals are not easy to find, for the Mongols use oxen or camels\r\nto draw most loads. The one we obtained had not been in the shafts for\r\nmore than two years and was badly frightened when we brought him near\r\nthe cart. It was a liberal education to see our Mongol handle that\r\nhorse! He first put a hobble on all four legs, then he swung a rope\r\nabout the hind quarters, trussed him tightly, and swung him into the\r\nshafts. When the pony was properly harnessed, he fastened the bridle to\r\nthe rear of the other cart and drove slowly ahead. At first the horse\r\ntried to kick and plunge, but the hobbles held him fast and in fifteen\r\nminutes he settled to the work. Then the Mongol removed the hobbles\r\nfrom the hind legs, and later left the pony entirely free. He walked\r\nbeside the animal for a long time, and did not attempt to drive him\r\nfrom the cart for at least an hour.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mongols seem unnecessarily rough and almost brutal, I do not\r\nbelieve that any people in the world can handle horses more expertly.\r\nFrom earliest childhood their real home is the back of a pony. Every\r\nyear, in the spring, a children's race is held at Urga. Boys and girls\r\nfrom four to six years old are tied on horses and ride at full speed\r\nover a mile-long course. If a child falls off it receives but scant\r\nsympathy and is strapped on again more tightly than before. A Mongol\r\nhas no respect whatever for a man or woman who cannot ride, and nothing\r\nwill win his regard as rapidly as expert horsemanship. Strangely\r\nenough the Mongols seldom show affection for their ponies, nor do they\r\ncaress them in any way; consequently, the animals do not enjoy being\r\npetted and are prone to kick and bite. My pony, Kublai Khan, was an\r\nextraordinary exception to this rule and was as affectionate and gentle\r\nas a kitten--but there are few animals like Kublai Khan in Mongolia!\r\n\r\nThe ponies are small, of course, but they are strong almost beyond\r\nbelief, and can stand punishment that would kill an ordinary horse. The\r\nMongols seldom ride except at a trot or a full gallop, and forty to\r\nfifty miles a day is not an unusual journey. Moreover, the animals are\r\nnot fed grain; they must forage on the plains the year round. During\r\nthe winter, when the grass is dry and sparse, they have poor feeding,\r\nbut nevertheless are able to withstand the extreme cold. They grow a\r\ncoat of hair five or six inches in length, and when Kublai Khan arrived\r\nin Peking after his long journey across the plains he looked more\r\nlike a grizzly bear than a horse. He had changed so completely from\r\nthe sleek, fine-limbed animal we had known in Mongolia that my wife\r\nwas almost certain he could not be the same pony. He had to be taught\r\nto eat carrots, apples, and other vegetables and would only sniff\r\nsuspiciously at sugar. But in a very short time he learned all the\r\ntastes of his city-bred companions.\r\n\r\nHorses are cheap in Mongolia, but not extraordinarily so. In the\r\nspring a fair pony can be purchased for from thirty to sixty dollars\r\n(silver), and especially good ones bring as much as one hundred and\r\nfifty dollars. In the fall when the Mongols are confronted with a hard\r\nwinter, which naturally exacts a certain toll from any herd, ponies\r\nsell for about two-thirds of their spring price.\r\n\r\nIn Urga we had been led to believe that the entire trip to Sain Noin\r\nKhan's village could be done in eight days and that game was plentiful\r\nalong the trail. We had already been on the road five days, making an\r\naverage of twenty-five miles at each stage, and the natives assured us\r\nthat it would require at least ten more days of steady travel before\r\nwe could possibly arrive at our destination; if difficulties arose it\r\nmight take even longer. Moreover, we had seen only one hare and one\r\nmarmot, and our traps had yielded virtually nothing. It was perfectly\r\nevident that the entire valley had been denuded of animal life by the\r\nMongols, and there was little prospect that conditions would change as\r\nlong as we remained on such rich grazing grounds.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to turn back and count the time lost, but it was certainly\r\nthe wisest course for we knew that there was good collecting on the\r\nplains south of Urga, although the fauna would not be as varied as at\r\nthe place we had hoped to reach. The summer in Mongolia is so short\r\nthat every day must be made to count if results which are worth the\r\nmoney invested are to be obtained.\r\n\r\nYvette and I were both very despondent that evening when we decided it\r\nwas necessary to turn back. It was one of those nights when I wished\r\nwith all my heart that we could sit in front of our own camp fire\r\nwithout the thought of having to \"make good\" to any one but ourselves.\r\nHowever, once the decision was made, we tried to forget the past days\r\nand determined to make up for lost time in the future.\r\n\r\nPLATE VIII\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TRAFFIC POLICEMAN ON URGA'S \"BROADWAY\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MONGOL LAMA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRASSLANDS OF OUTER MONGOLIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE LURE OF THE PLAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Monday, June 16, we left Urga to go south along the old caravan\r\ntrail toward Kalgan. Only a few weeks earlier we had skimmed over the\r\nrolling surface in motor cars, crossing in one day then as many miles\r\nof plains as our own carts could do in ten. But it had another meaning\r\nto us now, and the first night as we sat at dinner in front of the tent\r\nand watched the after-glow fade from the sky behind the pine-crowned\r\nridge of the Bogdo-ol, we thanked God that for five long months we\r\ncould leave the twentieth century with its roar and rush, and live as\r\nthe Mongols live; we knew that the days of discouragement had ended and\r\nthat we could learn the secrets of the desert life which are yielded up\r\nto but a chosen few.\r\n\r\nWithin twenty-five miles of Urga we had seen a dozen marmots and a\r\nspecies of gopher (_Citellus_) that was new to us. The next afternoon\r\nat two o'clock we climbed the last long slope from out the Tola River\r\ndrainage basin, and reached the plateau which stretches in rolling\r\nwaves of plain and desert to the frontier of China six hundred miles\r\naway. Before us three pools of water flashed like silver mirrors in\r\nthe sunlight, and beyond them, tucked away in a sheltered corner of\r\nthe hills, stood a little temple surrounded by a cluster of gray-white\r\n_yurts_.\r\n\r\nOur Mongol learned that the next water was on the far side of a plain\r\nthirty-five miles in width, so we camped beside the largest pond. It\r\nwas a beautiful spot with gently rolling hills on either side, and in\r\nfront, a level plain cut by the trail's white line.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the tents were up Yvette and I rode off, accompanied by\r\nthe lama, carrying a bag of traps. Within three hundred yards of camp\r\nwe found the first marmot. When it had disappeared underground we\r\ncarefully buried a steel trap at the entrance of the hole and anchored\r\nit securely to an iron tent peg. With rocks and earth we plugged all\r\nthe other openings, for there are usually five or six tunnels to every\r\nburrow. While the work was going on other marmots were watching us\r\ncuriously from half a dozen mounds, and we set nine traps before it was\r\ntime to return for dinner.\r\n\r\nThe two Chinese taxidermists had taken a hundred wooden traps for\r\nsmaller mammals, and before dark we inspected the places they had\r\nfound. Already one of them held a gray meadow vole (_Microtus_), quite\r\na different species from those which had been caught along the Tola\r\nRiver, and Yvette discovered one of the larger traps dragged halfway\r\ninto a hole with a baby marmot safely caught. He was only ten inches\r\nlong and covered with soft yellow-white fur.\r\n\r\nShortly after daylight the next morning the lama came to our tent to\r\nannounce that there was a marmot in one of the traps. The boy was\r\nas excited as a child of ten and had been up at dawn. When we were\r\ndressed we followed the Mongol to the first burrow where a fine marmot\r\nwas securely caught by the hind leg. A few yards away we had another\r\nfemale, and the third trap was pulled far into the hole. A huge male\r\nwas at the other end, but he had twisted his body halfway around a\r\ncurve in the tunnel and by pulling with all our strength the Mongol and\r\nI could not move him a single inch. Finally we gave up and had to dig\r\nhim out. He had given a wonderful exhibition of strength for so small\r\nan animal.\r\n\r\nIt was especially gratifying to catch these marmots so easily, for\r\nwe had been told in Urga that the Mongols could not trap them. I was\r\nat a loss to understand why, for they are closely related to the\r\n\"woodchucks\" of America with which every country boy is familiar. Later\r\nI learned the reason for the failure of the natives. In the Urga market\r\nwe saw some double-spring traps exactly like those of ours, but when\r\nI came to examine them I found they had been made in Russia, and the\r\nsprings were so weak that they were almost useless. These were the only\r\nsteel traps which the Mongols had ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe marmots (_Marmota robusta_) were supposed to be responsible for\r\nthe spread of the pneumonia plague which swept into northern China\r\nfrom Manchuria a few years ago; but I understand from physicians of\r\nthe Rockefeller Foundation in Peking, who especially investigated\r\nthe disease, that the animal's connection with it is by no means\r\nsatisfactorily determined.\r\n\r\nThe marmots hibernate during the winter, and retire to their burrows\r\nearly in October, not to emerge until April. When they first come out\r\nin the spring their fur is bright yellow, and the animals contrast\r\nbeautifully with the green grass. After the middle of June the yellow\r\nfur begins to slip off in patches, leaving exposed the new coat, which\r\nis exceedingly short and is mouse-gray in color. Then, of course, the\r\nskins are useless for commercial purposes. As the summer progresses the\r\nfur grows until by September first it has formed a long, soft coat of\r\nrich gray-brown which is of considerable economic value. The skins are\r\nshipped to Europe and America and during the past winter (1919-1920)\r\nwere especially popular as linings for winter coats.\r\n\r\nWe had an opportunity to see how quickly the demand in the great cities\r\nreaches directly to the center of production thousands of miles away.\r\nWhen we went to Urga in May prime marmot skins were worth thirty cents\r\neach to the Mongols. Early in October, when we returned, the hunters\r\nwere selling the same skins for _one dollar and twenty-jive cents\r\napiece_.\r\n\r\nThe natives always shoot the animals. When a Mongol has driven one into\r\nits burrow, he lies quietly beside the hole waiting for the marmot to\r\nappear. It may be twenty minutes or even an hour, but the Oriental\r\npatience takes little note of time. Finally a yellow head emerges and\r\na pair of shining eyes glance quickly about in every direction. Of\r\ncourse, they see the Mongol but he looks only like a mound of earth,\r\nand the marmot raises itself a few inches higher. The hunter lies\r\nas motionless as a log of wood until the animal is well put of its\r\nburrow--then he shoots.\r\n\r\nThe Mongols take advantage of the marmot's curiosity in an amusing and\r\neven more effective way. With a dogskin tied to his saddle the native\r\nrides over the plain until he reaches a marmot colony. He hobbles his\r\npony at a distance of three or four hundred yards, gets down on his\r\nhands and knees, and throws the dogskin over his shoulders. He crawls\r\nslowly toward the nearest animal, now and then stopping to bark and\r\nshake his head. In an instant, the marmot is all attention. He jumps\r\nup and down whistling and barking, but never venturing far from the\r\nopening of his burrow.\r\n\r\nAs the pseudo-dog advances there seems imminent danger that the fat\r\nlittle body will explode from curiosity and excitement. But suddenly\r\nthe \"dog\" collapses in the strangest way and the marmot raises on the\r\nvery tips of his toes to see what it is all about. Then there is a\r\nroar, a flash of fire and another skin is added to the millions which\r\nhave already been sent to the sea-coast from outer Mongolia.\r\n\r\nMr. Mamen often spoke of an extraordinary dance which he had seen the\r\nmarmots perform, and when Mr. and Mrs. MacCallie returned to Kalgan\r\nthey saw it also. We were never fortunate enough to witness it. Mac\r\nsaid that two marmots stood erect on their hind legs, grasping each\r\nother with their front paws, and danced slowly about exactly as\r\nthough they were waltzing. He agreed with Mamen that it was the most\r\nextraordinary and amusing thing he had ever seen an animal do. I can\r\nwell believe it, for the marmots have many curious habits which would\r\nrepay close study. The dance could hardly be a mating performance since\r\nMac saw it in late May and by that time the young had already been born.\r\n\r\nOne morning at the \"Marmot Camp,\" as we named the one where we first\r\nbegan real collecting, Yvette saw six or seven young animals on top of\r\na mound in the green grass. We went there later with a gun and found\r\nthe little fellows playing like kittens, chasing each other about and\r\nrolling over and over. It was hard to make myself bring tragedy into\r\ntheir lives, but we needed them for specimens. A group showing an\r\nentire marmot family would be interesting for the Museum; especially\r\nso in view of their reported connection with the pneumonic plague.\r\nWe collected a dozen others before the summer was over to show the\r\ncomplete transition from the first yellow coat to the gray-brown of\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nLike most rodents, the marmots grow rapidly and have so many young in\r\nevery litter that they will not soon be exterminated in Mongolia unless\r\nthe native hunters obtain American steel traps. Even then it would take\r\nsome years to make a really alarming impression upon the millions which\r\nspread over all the plains of northern Mongolia and Manchuria.\r\n\r\nSince these marmots are a distinctly northern animal they are a great\r\nhelp in determining the life zones of this part of Asia. We found that\r\ntheir southern limit is at Turin, one hundred and seventy-five miles\r\nfrom Urga. A few scattered families live there, but the real marmot\r\ncountry begins about twenty-five miles farther north.\r\n\r\nThe first hunting camp was eighty miles south of Urga, after we had\r\npassed a succession of low hills and reached what, in prehistoric\r\ntimes, was probably a great lake basin. When our tents were pitched\r\nbeside the well they seemed pitifully small in the vastness of the\r\nplain. The land rolled in placid waves to the far horizon on every\r\nhand. It was like a calm sea which is disturbed only by the lazy\r\nprogress of the ocean swell. Two _yurts_, like the sails of hull-down\r\nships, showed black against the sky-rim where it met the earth. The\r\nplain itself seemed at first as flat as a table, for the swells merged\r\nindistinguishably into a level whole. It was only when approaching\r\nhorsemen dipped for a little out of sight and the depressions swallowed\r\nthem up that we realized the unevenness of the land.\r\n\r\nCamp was hardly made before our Mongol neighbors began to pay their\r\nformal calls. A picturesque fellow, blazing with color, would dash up\r\nto our tent at a full gallop, slide off and hobble his pony almost\r\nin a single motion. With a \"_sai bina_\" of greeting he would squat\r\nin the door, produce his bottle of snuff and offer us a pinch. There\r\nwas a quiet dignity about these plains dwellers which was wonderfully\r\nappealing. They were seldom unduly curious, and when we indicated that\r\nthe visit was at an end, they left at once.\r\n\r\nSometimes they brought bowls of curded milk, or great lumps of cheese\r\nas presents, and in return we gave cigarettes or now and then a cake of\r\nsoap. Having been told in Urga that soap was especially appreciated by\r\nthe Mongols, I had brought a supply of red, blue, and green cakes which\r\nhad a scent even more wonderful than the color. I can't imagine why\r\nthey like it, for it is carefully put away and never used.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, the Mongols have no word for \"thank you\" other\r\nthan \"_sai_\" (good), but when they wish to express approbation, and\r\nusually when saying \"good-by,\" they put up the thumb with the fingers\r\nclosed. In Yün-nan and eastern Tibet we noted the same custom among the\r\naboriginal tribesmen. I wonder if it is merely a coincidence that in\r\nthe gladiatorial contests of ancient Rome \"thumbs up\" meant mercy or\r\napproval!\r\n\r\nThe Mongols told us that in the rolling ground to the east of camp we\r\ncould surely find antelope. The first morning my wife and I went out\r\nalone. We trotted steadily for an hour, making for the summit of a\r\nrise seven or eight miles from camp. Yvette held the ponies, while I\r\nsat down to sweep the country with my glasses. Directly in front of us\r\ntwo small valleys converged into a larger one, and almost immediately\r\nI discovered half a dozen orange-yellow forms in its very bottom about\r\ntwo miles away. They were antelope quietly feeding. In a few moments I\r\nmade out two more close together, and then four off at the right. After\r\nmy wife had found them with her glasses we sat down to plan the stalk.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that we should try to cross the two small depressions\r\nwhich debouched into the main valley and approach from behind the hill\r\ncrest nearest to the gazelles. We trotted slowly across the gully\r\nwhile the antelope were in sight, and then swung around at full gallop\r\nunder the protection of the rising ground. We came up just opposite\r\nto the herd and dismounted, but were fully six hundred yards away.\r\nSuddenly one of those impulses which the hunter never can explain sent\r\nthem off like streaks of yellow light, but they turned on the opposite\r\nhillside, slowed down, and moved uncertainly up the valley.\r\n\r\nMuch to our surprise four of the animals detached themselves from\r\nthe others and crossed the depression in our direction. When we saw\r\nthat they were really coming we threw ourselves into the saddles and\r\ngalloped forward to cut them off. Instantly the antelope increased\r\ntheir speed and literally flew up the hill slope. I shouted to Yvette\r\nto watch the holes and shook the reins over Kublai Khan's neck. Like\r\na bullet he was off. I could feel his great muscles flowing between\r\nmy knees but otherwise there seemed hardly a motion of his body in\r\nthe long, smooth run. Standing straight up in the stirrups, I glanced\r\nback at my wife who was sitting her chestnut stallion as lightly as a\r\nbutterfly. Hat gone, hair streaming, the thrill of it all showed in\r\nevery line of her body. She was running a close second, almost at my\r\nside. I saw a marmot hole flash by. A second death trap showed ahead\r\nand I swung Kublai Khan to the right. Another and another followed,\r\nbut the pony leaped them like a cat. The beat of the fresh, clean air;\r\nthe rush of the splendid horse; the sight of the yellow forms fleeing\r\nlike wind-blown ribbons across our path--all this set me mad with\r\nexcitement and a wild exhilaration. Suddenly I realized that I was\r\nyelling like an Indian. Yvette, too, was screaming in sheer delight.\r\n\r\nThe antelope were two hundred yards away when I tightened on the reins.\r\nKublai Khan stiffened and stopped in twenty yards. The first shot was\r\nlow and to the left, but it gave the range. At the second, the rearmost\r\nanimal stumbled, recovered itself, and ran wildly about in a circle. I\r\nmissed him twice, and he disappeared over a little hill. Leaping into\r\nthe saddle, we tore after the wounded animal. As we thundered over the\r\nrise I heard my wife screaming frantically and saw her pointing to the\r\nright where the antelope was lying down. There was just one more shell\r\nin the gun and my pockets were empty. I fired again at fifty yards and\r\nthe gazelle rolled over, dead.\r\n\r\nLeading our horses, Yvette and I walked up to the beautiful\r\norange-yellow form lying in the fresh, green grass. We both saw its\r\nhorns in the same instant and hugged each other in sheer delight. At\r\nthis time of the year the bucks are seldom with the does and then only\r\nin the largest herds. This one was in full pelage, spotless and with\r\nthe hair unworn. Moreover, it had finer horns than any other which we\r\nkilled during the entire trip.\r\n\r\nKublai Khan looked at the dead animal and arched his neck, as much\r\nas to say, \"Yes, I ran him down. He had to quit when I really got\r\nstarted.\" My wife held the pony's head, while I hoisted the antelope to\r\nhis back and strapped it behind the saddle. He watched the proceedings\r\ninterestedly but without a tremor, and even when I mounted, he paid not\r\nthe slightest attention to the head dangling on his flanks. Thereby he\r\nshowed that he was a very exceptional pony. In the weeks which followed\r\nhe proved it a hundred times, and I came to love him as I have never\r\nloved another animal.\r\n\r\nYvette and I trotted slowly back to camp, thrilled with the excitement\r\nof the wild ride. We began to realize that we were lucky to have\r\nescaped without broken necks. The race taught us never again to attempt\r\nto guide our ponies away from the marmot holes which spotted the\r\nplains, for the horses could see them better than we could and all\r\ntheir lives had known that they meant death.\r\n\r\nThat morning was our initiation into what is the finest sport we have\r\never known. Hunting from a motor car is undeniably exciting at first,\r\nbut a real sportsman can never care for it very long. The antelope\r\ndoes not have a chance against gas and steel and a long-range rifle.\r\nOn horseback the conditions are reversed. An antelope can run twice as\r\nfast as the best horse living. It can see as far as a man with prism\r\nbinoculars. All the odds are in the animal's favor except two--its\r\nfatal desire to run in a circle about the pursuer, and the use of a\r\nhigh-power rifle. But even then an antelope three hundred yards away,\r\ngoing at a speed of fifty miles an hour, is not an easy target.\r\n\r\nOf course, the majority of sportsmen will say that it cannot be done\r\nwith any certainty--until they go to Mongolia and do it themselves!\r\nBut, as I remarked in a previous chapter, conditions on the plains are\r\nso unusual that shooting in other parts of the world is no criterion.\r\nAfter one gets the range of an animal which, like the antelope, has a\r\nsmooth, even run, it is not so difficult to hit as one might imagine.\r\nPractice is the great essential. At the beginning I averaged one\r\nantelope to every eight cartridges, but later my score was one to three.\r\n\r\nWe spent the afternoon at the new camp, setting traps and preparing\r\nfor the days to come--days in which we knew, from long experience, we\r\nwould have every waking moment full of work. The nights were shortening\r\nrapidly, and the sun did not dip below the rim of our vast, flat world\r\nuntil half past seven. Then there was an hour of delightful, lingering\r\ntwilight, when the stars began to show in tiny points of light; by nine\r\no'clock the brooding silence of the Mongolian night had settled over\r\nall the plain.\r\n\r\nDaylight came at four o'clock, and before the sun rose we had finished\r\nbreakfast. Our traps held five marmots and a beautiful golden-yellow\r\npolecat (_Mustela_). I have never seen such an incarnation of fury as\r\nthis animal presented. It might have been the original of the Chinese\r\ndragon, except for its small size. Its long, slender body twisted and\r\nturned with incredible swiftness, every hair was bristling, and its\r\nsnarling little face emitted horrible squeaks and spitting squeals. It\r\nseemed to be cursing us in every language of the polecat tribe.\r\n\r\nThe fierce little beast was evidently bent upon a night raid on a\r\nmarmot family. We could imagine easily into what terror the tiny demon\r\nwould throw a nest of marmots comfortably snuggled together in the\r\nbottom of their burrow. Probably it would be most interested in the\r\nbabies, and undoubtedly would destroy every one within a few moments.\r\nAll the weasel family, to which the polecat belongs, kill for the pure\r\njoy of killing, and in China one such animal will entirely depopulate a\r\nhen-roost in a single night.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock Yvette and I left camp with the lama and rode northeast.\r\nThe plain swept away in long, grassy billows, and at every rise I\r\nstopped for a moment to scan the horizon with my glasses. Within half\r\nan hour we discovered a herd of antelope six or seven hundred yards\r\naway. They saw us instantly and trotted nervously about, staring in our\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nDropping behind the crest of the rise, I directed the lama to ride\r\ntoward them from behind while we swung about to cut them off. He was\r\nhardly out of sight when we heard a snort and a rush of pounding hoofs.\r\nWith a shout to Yvette I loosened the reins over Kublai Khan's neck,\r\nand he shot forward like a yellow arrow. Yvette was close beside me,\r\nleaning far over her pony's neck. We headed diagonally toward the\r\nherd, and they gradually swung toward us as though drawn by a powerful\r\nmagnet. On we went, down into a hollow and up again on its slope. We\r\ncould not spare the horses for the antelope were already over the crest\r\nand lost to view, but our horses took the hill at full speed, and from\r\nthe summit we could see the herd fairly on our course, three hundred\r\nyards away.\r\n\r\nKublai Khan braced himself like a polo pony when he felt the pressure\r\nof my knees, and I opened fire almost under his nose. At the crack of\r\nthe rifle there was a spurt of brown dust near the leading animal.\r\n\"High and to the left,\" shouted Yvette, and I held a little lower for\r\nthe second trial. The antelope dropped like a piece of white paper,\r\nshot through the neck. I paced the distance and found it to be three\r\nhundred and sixty-seven yards. It seemed a very long shot then, but\r\nlater I found that almost none of my antelope were killed at less than\r\nthree hundred yards.\r\n\r\nAs I came up to Kublai Khan with the dead animal, I accidentally\r\nstruck him on the flank with my rifle in such a way that he was badly\r\nfrightened. He galloped off, and Yvette had a hard chase before he\r\nfinally allowed her to catch him. Had I been alone I should probably\r\nhave had a long walk to camp.\r\n\r\nIt taught us never to hunt without a companion, if it could possibly\r\nbe avoided. If your horse runs away, you may be left many miles from\r\nwater, with rather serious consequences. I think there is nothing which\r\nmakes me feel more helpless than to be alone on the plains without\r\na horse. For miles and miles there is only the rolling grassland or\r\nthe wide sweep of desert, with never a house or tree to break the low\r\nhorizon. It seems so futile to walk, your own legs carry you so slowly\r\nand such a pitifully short distance, in these vast spaces.\r\n\r\nTo be left alone in a small boat on the open sea is exactly similar.\r\nYou feel so very, very small and you realize then what an insignificant\r\npart of nature you really are. I have felt it, too, amid vast mountains\r\nwhen I have been toiling up a peak which stretched thousands of feet\r\nabove me with others rearing their majestic forms on every side. Then,\r\nnature seems almost alive and full of menace; something to be fought\r\nand conquered by brain and will.\r\n\r\nEarly in our work upon the plains we learned how easy it is to lose\r\none's way. The vast sea of land seems absolutely flat, but in reality\r\nit is a gently rolling surface full of slopes and hollows, every one\r\nof which looks exactly like the others. But after a time we developed\r\na _land sense_. The Mongols all have it to an extraordinary degree. We\r\ncould drop an antelope on the plain and leave it for an hour or more.\r\nWith a quick glance about our lama would fix the place in his mind, and\r\ndash off on a chase which might carry us back and forth toward every\r\npoint of the compass. When it was time to return, he would head his\r\npony unerringly for that single spot on the plain and take us back as\r\nstraight as the flight of an arrow.\r\n\r\nAt first it gave him unceasing enjoyment when we became completely\r\nlost, but in a very short time we learned to note the position of the\r\nsun, the character of the ground, and the direction of the wind. Then\r\nwe began to have more confidence in ourselves. But only by years of\r\ntraining can one hope even to approximate the Mongols. They have been\r\nborn and reared upon the plains, and have the inheritance of unknown\r\ngenerations whose very life depended upon their ability to come and\r\ngo at will. To them, the hills, the sun, the grass, the sand--all have\r\nbecome the street signs of the desert.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of our second day I remained at the tents to measure\r\nspecimens, while Yvette and the lama rode out toward the scene of our\r\nmorning hunt to locate an antelope which one of our Mongol neighbors\r\nhad reported dead not far away. At six o'clock they came galloping back\r\nwith the news that there were two gazelles within three miles of camp.\r\nI saddled Kublai Khan and left with them at once. Twenty minutes of\r\nsteady trotting brought us to the summit of a slope, where we could see\r\nthe animals quietly feeding not five hundred yards away.\r\n\r\nIt was just possible to stalk them for a long-range shot, and slipping\r\noff my pony, I flattened out upon the ground. On hands and knees, and\r\nsometimes at full length, I wormed my way through the grass for one\r\nhundred yards. The cover ended there and I must shoot or come into\r\nfull view of the gazelles. They were so far away that the front sight\r\nentirely covered the animals, and to increase the difficulty, both\r\nwere walking slowly. The first bullet struck low and to the right, but\r\nthe antelope only jumped and stared fixedly in my direction; at the\r\nsecond shot one went down. The other animal dashed away like a flash of\r\nlightning, and although I sent a bullet after its white rump-patch, the\r\nshot was hopeless.\r\n\r\nThe antelope I had knocked over got to its feet and tried desperately\r\nto get away, but the lama leaped on his pony and caught it by one\r\nhind leg. My automatic pistol was not in working order, and it was\r\nnecessary to knife the poor beast--a job which I hate like poison. The\r\nlama walked away a dozen yards and covered his face with the sleeve\r\nof his gown. It is against the laws of the Buddhist religion to take\r\nthe life of any animal or even to see it done, although there are no\r\nrestrictions as to eating flesh.\r\n\r\nWith a blanket the Mongol made a seat for himself on his pony's\r\nhaunches, and threw the antelope across his saddle; then we trotted\r\nback to camp into the painted western sky, with the cool night air\r\nbringing to us the scent of newborn grass. We would not have exchanged\r\nour lot that night with any one on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nHUNTING ON THE TURIN PLAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter ten days we left the \"Antelope Camp\" to visit the Turin plain\r\nwhere we had seen much game on the way to Urga. One by one our Mongol\r\nneighbors rode up to say \"farewell,\" and each to present us with\r\na silk scarf as a token of friendship and good will. We received\r\nan invitation to stop for tea at the _yurt_ of an old man who had\r\nmanifested an especial interest in us, but it was a very dirty _yurt_,\r\nand the preparations for tea were so uninviting that we managed to exit\r\ngracefully before it was finally served.\r\n\r\nYvette photographed the entire family including half a dozen dogs, a\r\ncalf, and two babies, much to their enjoyment. When we rode off, our\r\nhands were heaped with cheese and slabs of mutton which were discarded\r\nas soon, as we had dropped behind a slope. Mongol hospitality is\r\nwhole-souled and generously given, but one must be very hungry to enjoy\r\ntheir food.\r\n\r\nA day and a half of traveling was uneventful, for herds of sheep and\r\nhorses indicated the presence of _yurts_ among the hills. Game will\r\nseldom remain where there are Mongols. Although it was the first of\r\nJuly, we found a heavy coating of ice on the lower sides of a deep\r\nwell. The water was about fifteen feet below the level of the plain,\r\nand the ice would probably remain all summer. Moreover, it is said that\r\nthe wells never freeze even during the coldest winter.\r\n\r\nPLATE IX\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONGOL HERDSMEN CARRYING LASSOS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LONE CAMP ON THE DESERT]\r\n\r\nThe changes of temperature were more rapid than in any other country\r\nin which I have ever hunted. It was hot during the day--about 85°\r\nFahrenheit--but the instant the sun disappeared we needed coats, and\r\nour fur sleeping bags were always acceptable at night.\r\n\r\nWe were one hundred and fifty miles from Urga and were still going\r\nslowly south, when we had our next real hunting camp. Great bands of\r\nantelope were working northward from the Gobi Desert to the better\r\ngrazing on the grass-covered Turin plain. We encountered the main herd\r\none evening about six o'clock, and it was a sight which made us gasp\r\nfor breath. We were shifting camp, and my wife and I were trotting\r\nalong parallel to the carts which moved slowly over the trail a mile\r\naway. We had had a delightful, as well as a profitable, day. Yvette\r\nhad been busy with her camera, while I picked up an antelope, a\r\nbustard, three hares, and half a dozen marmots. We were loafing in our\r\nsaddles, when suddenly we caught sight of the cook standing on his cart\r\nfrantically signaling us to come.\r\n\r\nIn ten seconds our ponies were flying toward the caravan, while we\r\nmentally reviewed every accident which possibly could have happened\r\nto the boys. Lü met us twenty yards from the trail, trembling with\r\nexcitement and totally incoherent. He could only point to the south and\r\nstammer, \"Too many antelope. Over there. Too many, too many.\"\r\n\r\nI slipped off Kublai Khan's back and put up the glasses. Certainly\r\nthere were animals, but I thought they must be sheep or ponies.\r\nHundreds were in sight, feeding in one vast herd and in many smaller\r\ngroups. Then I remembered that the nearest well was twenty miles away;\r\ntherefore they could not be horses. I looked again and knew they must\r\nbe antelope--not in hundreds, but in thousands.\r\n\r\nMr. Larsen in Urga had told us of herds like this, but we had never\r\nhoped to see one. Yet there before us, as far as the eye could reach,\r\nwas a yellow mass of moving forms. In a moment Yvette and I had left\r\nthe carts. There was no possibility of concealment, and our only chance\r\nwas to run the herd. When we were perhaps half a mile away the nearest\r\nanimals threw up their heads and began to stamp and run about, only to\r\nstop again and stare at us. We kept on very slowly, edging nearer every\r\nmoment. Suddenly they decided that we were really dangerous, and the\r\nherd strung out like a regiment of yellow-coated soldiers.\r\n\r\nKublai Khan had seen the antelope almost as soon as we left the\r\ncarts, and although he had already traveled forty miles that day, was\r\nnervously champing the bit with head up and ears erect. When at last I\r\ngave him the word, he gathered himself for one terrific spring; down\r\nwent his head and he dashed forward with every ounce of strength behind\r\nhis flying legs. His run was the long, smooth stride of a thoroughbred,\r\nand it sent the blood surging through my veins in a wild thrill of\r\nexhilaration. Once only I glanced back at Yvette. She was almost at\r\nmy side. Her hair had loosened and was flying back like a veil behind\r\nher head. Tense with excitement, eyes shining, she was heedless of\r\neverything save those skimming yellow forms before us. It was useless\r\nto look for holes; ere I had seen one we were over or around it. With\r\nhead low down and muzzle out, my pony needed not the slightest touch to\r\nguide him. He knew where we were going and the part he had to play.\r\n\r\nMore than a thousand antelope were running diagonally across our\r\ncourse. It was a sight to stir the gods; a thing to give one's life to\r\nsee. But when we were almost near enough to shoot, the herd suddenly\r\nswerved heading directly away from us. In an instant we were enveloped\r\nin a whirling cloud of dust through which the flying animals were\r\ndimly visible like phantom figures. Kublai Khan was choked, and his\r\nhot breath rasped sharply through his nostrils, but he plunged on and\r\non into that yellow cloud. Standing in my stirrups, I fired six times\r\nat the wraithlike forms ahead as fast as I could work the lever of my\r\nrifle. Of course, it was useless, but just the same I had to shoot.\r\n\r\nIn about a mile the great herd slowed down and stopped. We could see\r\nhundreds of animals on every side, in groups of fifty or one hundred.\r\nProbably two thousand antelope were in sight at once and many more\r\nwere beyond the sky rim to the west. We gave the ponies ten minutes'\r\nrest, and had another run as unsuccessful as the first. Then a third\r\nand fourth. The antelope, for some strange reason, would not cross our\r\npath, but always turned straight away before we were near enough to\r\nshoot.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour we returned to the carts--for Yvette was exhausted from\r\nexcitement--and the lama took her place. We left the great herd and\r\nturned southward, parallel to the road. A mile away we found more\r\nantelope; at least a thousand were scattered about feeding quietly like\r\nthose we had driven north. It seemed as though all the gazelles in\r\nMongolia had concentrated on those few miles of plain.\r\n\r\nThe ponies were so exhausted that we decided to try a drive and leave\r\nthe main herd in peace. When we were concealed from view in the bottom\r\nof a land swell I slipped off and hobbled Kublai Khan. The poor fellow\r\nwas so tired he could only stand with drooping head, even though there\r\nwas rich grass beneath his feet. I sent the lama in a long circle to\r\nget behind the herd, while I crawled a few hundred yards away and\r\nsnuggled out of sight into an old wolf den.\r\n\r\nI watched the antelope for fifteen minutes through my binoculars. They\r\nwere feeding in a vast semicircle, entirely unconscious of my presence.\r\nSuddenly every head went up; they stared fixedly toward the west for a\r\nmoment, and were off like the wind. About five hundred drew together in\r\na compact mass, but a dozen smaller herds scattered wildly, running in\r\nevery direction except toward me. They had seen the lama before he had\r\nsucceeded in completely encircling them, and the drive was ruined.\r\n\r\nThe Mongols kill great numbers of antelope in just this way. When\r\na herd has been located, a line of men will conceal themselves at\r\ndistances of two or three hundred yards, while as many more get behind\r\nthe animals and drive them toward the waiting hunters. Sometimes the\r\ngazelles almost step on the natives and become so frightened that they\r\nrun the gantlet of the entire firing line.\r\n\r\nI did not have the heart to race again with our exhausted ponies, and\r\nwe turned back toward the carts which were out of sight. Scores of\r\nantelope, singly or in pairs, were visible on the sky line and as we\r\nrode to the summit of a little rise a herd of fifty appeared almost\r\nbelow us. We paid no attention to them; but suddenly my pony stopped\r\nwith ears erect. He looked back at me, as much as to say, \"Don't you\r\nsee those antelope?\" and began gently pulling at the reins. I could\r\nfeel him tremble with eagerness and excitement. \"Well, old chap,\" I\r\nsaid, \"if you are as keen as all that, let's give them a run.\"\r\n\r\nWith a magnificent burst of speed Kublai Khan launched himself toward\r\nthe fleeing animals. They circled beautifully, straight into the eye\r\nof the sun, which lay like a great red ball upon the surface of the\r\nplain. We were still three hundred yards away and gaining rapidly, but\r\nI had to shoot; in a moment I would be blinded by the sun. As the flame\r\nleaped from my rifle, we heard the dull thud of a bullet on flesh; at\r\nthe second shot, another; and then a third. \"_Sanga_\" (three), yelled\r\nthe lama, and dashed forward, wild with excitement.\r\n\r\nThe three gazelles lay almost the same distance apart, each one\r\nshot through the body. It was interesting evidence that the actions\r\nof working the lever on my rifle and aiming, and the speed of the\r\nantelope, varied only by a fraction of a second. In this case, brain\r\nand eye and hand had functioned perfectly. Needless to say, I do not\r\nalways shoot like that.\r\n\r\nTwo of the antelope were yearling bucks, and one was a large doe. The\r\nlama took the female on his pony, and I strapped the other two on\r\nKublai Khan. When I mounted, he was carrying a weight of two hundred\r\nand eighty-five pounds, yet he kept his steady \"homeward trot\" without\r\na break until we reached the carts six miles away.\r\n\r\nYvette had been afraid that we would miss the well in the gathering\r\ndarkness, and had made a \"dry camp\" beside the road. We had only a\r\nlittle water for ourselves; but my pony's nose was full of dust, and\r\nI knew how parched his throat must be, so I divided my supply with\r\nhim. The poor animal was so frightened by the dish, that he would only\r\nsnort and back away; even when I wet his nose with some of the precious\r\nfluid, he would not drink.\r\n\r\nThe success of our work upon the plains depended largely upon Kublai\r\nKhan. He was only a Mongol pony but he was just as great, in his own\r\nway, as was the Tartar emperor whose name he bore. Whatever it was I\r\nasked him to do, he gave his very best. Can you wonder that I loved him?\r\n\r\nWithin a fortnight from the time I bought him, he became a perfect\r\nhunting pony. The secret of it all was that he liked the game as well\r\nas I. Traveling with the carts bored him exceedingly but the instant\r\ngame appeared he was all excitement. Often he saw antelope before we\r\ndid. We might be trotting slowly over the plains, when suddenly he\r\nwould jerk his head erect and begin to pull gently at the reins; when I\r\nreached down to take my rifle from the holster, he would tremble with\r\neagerness to be off.\r\n\r\nIn hunting antelope you should ride slowly toward the animals, drawing\r\nnearer gradually. They are so accustomed to see Mongols that they will\r\nnot begin to run in earnest until a man is five or six hundred yards\r\naway, but when they are really off, a fast pony is the great essential.\r\nThe time to stop is just before the animals cross your path, and then\r\nyou must stop quickly. Kublai Khan learned the trick immediately. As\r\nsoon as he felt the pressure of my knees, and the slightest pull upon\r\nthe reins, his whole body stiffened and he braced himself like a polo\r\npony. It made not the slightest difference to him whether I shot from\r\nhis back or directly under his nose; he stood quietly watching the\r\nrunning antelope. When we were riding across the plaints if a bird ran\r\nalong the ground or a hare jumped out of the grass, he was after it\r\nlike a dog. Often I would find myself flying toward an animal which I\r\nhad never seen.\r\n\r\nYvette's pony was useless for hunting antelope. Instead of heading\r\ndiagonally toward the gazelles he would always attempt to follow the\r\nherd. When it was time to stop I would have to put all my strength\r\nupon the reins and the horse would come into a slow gallop and then a\r\ntrot. Seconds of valuable time would be wasted before I could begin to\r\nshoot. I tried half a dozen other ponies, but they were all as bad.\r\nThey did not have the intelligence or the love of hunting which made\r\nKublai Khan so valuable.\r\n\r\nThe morning after encountering the great herd, we camped at a well\r\nthirty miles north of the Turin monastery. Three or four _yurts_ were\r\nscattered about, and a caravan of two hundred and fifty camels was\r\nresting in a little hollow. From the door of our tent we could see\r\nthe blue summit of the Turin \"mountain,\" and have in the foreground a\r\nperpetual moving picture of camels, horses, sheep, goats, and cattle\r\nseeking water. All day long hundreds of animals crowded about the well,\r\nwhile one or two Mongols filled the troughs by means of wooden buckets.\r\n\r\nThe life about the wells is always interesting, for they are points\r\nof concentration for all wanderers on the plains. Just as we pitch\r\nour tents and make ourselves at home, so great caravans arrive with\r\ntired, laden camels. The huge brutes kneel, while their packs are being\r\nremoved, and then stand in a long line, patiently waiting until their\r\nturn comes to drink. Groups of ten or twelve crowd about the trough;\r\nthen, majestically swinging their padded feet, they move slowly to one\r\nside, kneel upon the ground, and sleepily chew their cuds until all\r\nthe herd has joined them. Sometimes the caravans wait for several days\r\nto rest their animals and let them feed; sometimes they vanish in the\r\nfirst gray light of dawn.\r\n\r\nOn the Turin plain we had a delightful glimpse of antelope babyhood.\r\nThe great herds which we had found were largely composed of does just\r\nready to drop their young, and after a few days they scattered widely\r\ninto groups of from five to twenty.\r\n\r\nWe found the first baby antelope on June 27. We had seen half a dozen\r\nfemales circling restlessly about, and suspected that their fawns could\r\nnot be far away. Sure enough, our Mongol discovered one of the little\r\nfellows in the flattest part of the flat plain. It was lying motionless\r\nwith its neck stretched out, just where its mother had told it to\r\nremain when she saw us riding toward her.\r\n\r\nYvette called to me, \"Oh, please, please catch it. We can raise it on\r\nmilk and it will make such an adorable pet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" I said, \"let's do. I'll get it for you. You can put it in\r\nyour hat till we go back to camp.\"\r\n\r\nIn blissful ignorance I dismounted and slowly went toward the little\r\nanimal. There was not the slightest motion until I tossed my outspread\r\nshooting coat. Then I saw a flash of brown, a bobbing white rump-patch,\r\nand a tiny thing, no larger than a rabbit, speeding over the plain. The\r\nbaby was somewhat \"wabbly,\" to be sure, for this was probably the first\r\ntime it had ever tried its slender legs, but after a few hundred yards\r\nit ran as steadily as its mother.\r\n\r\nI was so surprised that for a moment I simply stared. Then I leaped\r\ninto the saddle and Kublai Khan rushed after the diminutive brown\r\nfawn. It was a good half mile before we had the little chap under the\r\npony's nose but the race was by no means ended. Mewing with fright,\r\nit swerved sharply to the left and ere we could swing about, it had\r\ngained a hundred yards. Again and again we were almost on it, but every\r\ntime it dodged and got away. After half an hour my pony was gasping\r\nfor breath, and I changed to Yvette's chestnut stallion. The Mongol\r\njoined me and we had another run, but we might have been pursuing a\r\nstreak of shifting sunlight. Finally we had to give it up and watch the\r\ntiny thing bob away toward its mother, who was circling about in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThere were half a dozen other fawns upon the plain, but they all\r\ntreated us alike and my wife's hat was empty when we returned to camp.\r\nThese antelope probably had been born not more than two or three days\r\nbefore we found them. Later, after a chase of more than a mile, we\r\ncaught one which was only a few hours old. Had it not injured itself\r\nwhen dodging between my pony's legs we could never have secured it at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThus, nature, in the great scheme of life, has provided for her\r\nantelope children by blessing them with undreamed-of speed and only\r\nduring the first days of babyhood could a wolf catch them on the open\r\nplain. When they are from two to three weeks old they run with the\r\nfemales in herds of six or eight, and you cannot imagine what a pretty\r\nsight it is to see the little fellows skimming like tiny, brown\r\nchickens beside their mothers. There is another wonderful provision\r\nfor their life upon the desert. The digestive fluids of the stomach\r\nact upon the starch in the vegetation which they eat so that it forms\r\nsufficient water for their needs. Therefore, some species never drink.\r\n\r\nThe antelope choose a flat plain on which to give birth to their young\r\nin order to be well away from the wolves which are their greatest\r\nenemy; and the fawns are taught to lie absolutely motionless upon the\r\nground until they know that they have been discovered. Apparently\r\nthey are all born during the last days of June and in the first week\r\nof July. The great herds which we encountered were probably moving\r\nnorthward both to obtain better grazing and to drop their young on the\r\nTurin plain. During this period the old bucks go off singly into the\r\nrolling ground, and the herds are composed only of does and yearling\r\nmales. It was always possible to tell at once if an antelope had a fawn\r\nupon the plain, for she would run in a wide circle around the spot and\r\nrefuse to be driven away.\r\n\r\nWe encountered only two species of antelope between Kalgan and Urga.\r\nThe one of which I have been writing, and with which we became best\r\nacquainted, was the Mongolian gazelle (_Gazella gutturosa_). The other\r\nwas the goitered gazelle (_Gazella subgutturosa_). In the western Gobi,\r\nthe Prjevalski gazelle (_Gazella prjevalski_) is more abundant than the\r\nother species, but it never reaches the region which we visited.\r\n\r\nThe goitered antelope is seldom found on the rolling meadowlands\r\nbetween Kalgan and Panj-kiang on the south, or between Turin and Urga\r\non the north, according to our observations; they keep almost entirely\r\nto the Gobi Desert between Panj-kiang and Turin, and we often saw\r\nthem among the \"nigger heads\" or tussocks in the most arid parts.\r\nThe Mongolian gazelle, on the other hand, is most abundant in the\r\ngrasslands both north and south of the Gobi, but nevertheless has a\r\ncontinuous distribution across the plateau between Kalgan and Urga.\r\n\r\nOn our northward trip in May, when we took motion pictures of the\r\nantelope on the Panj-kiang plain, both, species were present, but the\r\ngoitered gazelle far outnumbered the others--which is unusual in that\r\nlocality. It could always be distinguished from the Mongolian gazelle\r\nbecause of its smaller size, darker coloring, and the long tail which\r\nit carries straight up in the air at right angles to the back; the\r\nMongolian antelope has an exceedingly short tail. The horns of both\r\nspecies differ considerably in shape and can easily be distinguished.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter these antelope develop a coat of very long, soft hair\r\nwhich is light brown-gray in color strongly tinged with rufous on the\r\nhead and face. Its summer pelage is a beautiful orange-fawn. The winter\r\ncoat is shed during May, and the animals lose their short summer hair\r\nin late August and early September.\r\n\r\nBoth species have a greatly enlarged larynx from which the goitered\r\ngazelle derives its name. What purpose this extraordinary character\r\nserves the animal, I am at a loss to know. Certainly it is not to\r\ngive them an exceptional \"voice\"; for, when wounded, I have heard them\r\nmake only a deep-toned roar which was by no means loud. Specimens of\r\nthe larynx which we preserved in formalin are now being prepared for\r\nanatomical study.\r\n\r\nAlthough the two species inhabit the same locality, they keep well by\r\nthemselves and only once, on the Panj-kiang plain, did we see them\r\nrunning together in the same herd; then it was probably because they\r\nwere frightened by the car. I doubt if they ever interbreed except in\r\nrare instances.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these animals can develop such an extraordinary speed was\r\na great surprise to me, as undoubtedly it will be to most naturalists.\r\nHad we not been able to determine it accurately by means of the\r\nspeedometers on our cars, I should never have dared state that they\r\ncould reach fifty-five or sixty miles an hour. It must be remembered\r\nthat the animals can continue at such a high speed only for a short\r\ndistance--perhaps half a mile--and will never exert themselves to the\r\nutmost unless they are thoroughly frightened. They would run just fast\r\nenough to keep well away from the cars or our horses, and it was only\r\nwhen we began to shoot that they showed what they were capable of\r\ndoing. When the bullets began to scatter about them they would seem to\r\nflatten several inches and run at such a terrific speed that their legs\r\nappeared only as a blur.\r\n\r\nOf course, they have developed their fleetness as a protection from\r\nenemies. Their greatest menace is the wolves, but since we demonstrated\r\nthat these animals cannot travel faster than about thirty miles an\r\nhour, the antelope are perfectly safe unless they happen to be caught\r\noff their guard. To prevent just this, the gazelles usually keep well\r\nout on the open plains and avoid rocks or abrupt hills which would\r\nfurnish cover for a wolf. Of course, they often go into the rolling\r\nground, but it is usually where the slopes are gradual and where they\r\nhave sufficient space in which to protect themselves.\r\n\r\nThe gazelles have a perfectly smooth, even run when going at full\r\nspeed. I have often seen them bound along when not particularly\r\nfrightened, but never when they are really trying to get away in the\r\nshortest possible time. The front limbs, as in the case of a deer, act\r\nlargely as supports and the real motive power comes from the hind legs.\r\nIf an antelope has only a front leg broken no living horse can catch\r\nit, but with a shattered hind limb my pony could run it down. I have\r\nalready related (see page 49) how, in a car, we pursued an antelope\r\nwith both front legs broken below the knee; even then, it reached a\r\nspeed of fifteen miles an hour. The Mongolian plains are firm and hard\r\nwith no bushes or other obstructions and, consequently, are especially\r\nfavorable for rapid travel.\r\n\r\nThe cheetah, or hunting leopard of Africa, has the reputation of being\r\nable to reach a greater speed, for a short dash, than any other animal\r\nin that country, and I have often wondered how it would fare in a race\r\nwith a Mongolian gazelle. Unfortunately, conditions in Africa are not\r\nfavorable for the use of automobiles in hunting, and no actual facts as\r\nto the speed of the cheetah are available.\r\n\r\nAt this camp, and during the journey back to Urga, we had many glorious\r\nhunts. Each one held its own individual fascination, for no two were\r\njust alike; and every day we learned something new about the life\r\nhistory of the Mongolian antelope. We needed specimens for a group in\r\nthe new Hall of Asiatic Life in the American Museum of Natural History,\r\nas well as a series representing all ages of both males and females for\r\nscientific study. When we returned to Urga we had them all.\r\n\r\nThe hunting of large game was only one aspect of our work. We usually\r\nreturned to camp about two o'clock in the afternoon. As soon as tiffin\r\nhad been eaten my wife worked at her photography, while I busied\r\nmyself over the almost innumerable details of the preparation and\r\ncataloguing of our specimens. About six o'clock, accompanied by the two\r\nChinese taxidermists carrying bags of traps, we would leave the tents.\r\nSometimes we would walk several miles, meanwhile carefully scrutinizing\r\nthe ground for holes or traces of mammal workings, and set eighty or\r\none hundred traps. We might find a colony of meadow voles (_Microtus_)\r\nwhere dozens of \"runways\" betrayed their presence, or discover the\r\nburrows of the desert hamster (_Cricetulus_). These little fellows, not\r\nlarger than a house mouse, have their tiny feet enveloped in soft fur,\r\nlike the slippers of an Eskimo baby.\r\n\r\nAs we walked back to camp in the late afternoon, we often saw a\r\nkangaroo rat (_Alactaga mongolica?_) jumping across the plain, and when\r\nwe had driven it into a hole, we could be sure to catch it in a trap\r\nthe following morning. They are gentle little creatures, with huge,\r\nround eyes, long, delicate ears, and tails tufted at the end like the\r\nfeathers on an arrow's shaft. The name expresses exactly what they\r\nare like--diminutive kangaroos--but, of course, they are rodents and\r\nnot marsupials. During the glacial period of the early Pleistocene,\r\nabout one hundred thousand years ago, we know from fossil remains that\r\nthere were great invasions into Europe of most of these types of tiny\r\nmammals, which we were catching during this delightful summer on the\r\nMongolian plains.\r\n\r\nAfter two months we regretfully turned back toward Urga. Our summer\r\nwas to be divided between the plains on the south and the forests\r\nto the north of the sacred city, and the first half of the work had\r\nbeen completed. The results had been very satisfactory, and our boxes\r\ncontained five hundred specimens; but our hearts were sad. The wide\r\nsweep of the limitless, grassy sea, the glorious morning rides, and\r\nthe magic of the starlit nights had filled our blood. Even the lure of\r\nthe unknown forests could not make us glad to go, for the plains had\r\nclaimed us as their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nAN ADVENTURE IN THE LAMA CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nLate on a July afternoon my wife and I stood disconsolately in the\r\nmiddle of the road on the outskirts of Urga. We had halted because\r\nthe road had ended abruptly in a muddy river. Moreover, the river was\r\nwhere it had no right to be, for we had traveled that road before\r\nand had found only a tiny trickle across its dusty surface. We were\r\ndisconsolate because we wished to camp that night in Urga, and there\r\nwere abundant signs that it could not be done.\r\n\r\nAt least the Mongols thought so, and we had learned that what a Mongol\r\ndoes not do had best \"give us pause.\" They had accepted the river with\r\nOriental philosophy and had made their camps accordingly. Already a\r\nscore of tents dotted the hillside, and _argul_ fires were smoking in\r\nthe doorways. Hundreds of carts were drawn up in an orderly array while\r\na regiment of oxen wandered about the hillside or sleepily chewed their\r\ncuds beside the loads. In a few hours or days or weeks the river would\r\ndisappear, and then they would go on to Urga. Meanwhile, why worry?\r\n\r\nTwo adventurous spirits, with a hundred camels, tried to cross. We\r\nwatched the huge beasts step majestically into the water, only to\r\nhuddle together in a yellow-brown mass when they reached midstream.\r\nAll their dignity fled, and they became merely frightened mountains of\r\nflesh amid a chaos of writhing necks and wildly switching tails.\r\n\r\nBut stranger still was a motor car standing on a partly submerged\r\nisland between two branches of the torrent. We learned later that its\r\nowners had successfully navigated the first stream and entered the\r\nsecond. A flooded carburetor had resulted, and ere the car was again in\r\nrunning order, the water had risen sufficiently to maroon them on the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I both lack the philosophical nature of the Oriental, and\r\nit was a sore trial to camp within rifle shot of Urga. But we did not\r\ndare leave our carts, loaded with precious specimens, to the care of\r\nservants and the curiosity of an ever increasing horde of Mongols.\r\n\r\nFor a well-nigh rainless month we had been hunting upon the plains,\r\nwhile only one hundred and fifty miles away Urga had had an almost\r\ndaily deluge. In mid-summer heavy rain-clouds roll southward to burst\r\nagainst \"God's Mountain,\" which rears its green-clad summits five\r\nthousand feet above the valley. Then it is only a matter of hours\r\nbefore every streamlet becomes a swollen torrent. But they subside as\r\nquickly as they rise, and the particular river which barred our road\r\nhad lost its menace before the sun had risen in a cloudless morning\r\nsky. All the valley seemed in motion. We joined the motley throng of\r\ncamels, carts, and horsemen; and even the motor car coughed and wheezed\r\nits way to Urga under the stimulus of two bearded Russians.\r\n\r\nPLATE X\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIBETAN YAKS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUR CARAVAN CROSSING THE TERELCHE RIVER]\r\n\r\nWe made our camp on a beautiful bit of lawn within a few hundred yards\r\nof one of the most interesting of all the Urga temples. It is known\r\nto the foreigners in the city as \"God's Brother's House,\" for it was\r\nthe residence of the Hutukhtu's late brother. The temple presents a\r\nbewildering collection of carved gables and gayly painted pavilions\r\nflaunting almost every color of the rainbow. Yvette and I were consumed\r\nwith curiosity to see what was contained within the high palisades\r\nwhich surround the buildings. We knew it would be impossible to obtain\r\npermission for her to go inside, and one evening as we were walking\r\nalong the walls we glanced through the open gate. No one was in sight\r\nand from somewhere in the far interior we heard the moaning chant of\r\nmany voices. Evidently the lamas were at their evening prayers.\r\n\r\nWe stepped inside the door intending only to take a rapid look. The\r\nentire court was deserted, so we slipped through the second gate and\r\nstood just at the entrance of the main temple, the \"holy of holies.\" In\r\nthe half darkness we could see the tiny points of yellow light where\r\ncandles burned before the altar. On either side was a double row of\r\nkneeling lamas, their wailing chant broken by the clash of cymbals and\r\nthe boom of drums.\r\n\r\nBeside the temple were a hideous foreign house and an enormous\r\n_yurt_--evidently the former residences of \"God's Brother\"; in the\r\ncorners of the compound were ornamental pavilions painted green and\r\nred. Except for these, the court was empty.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a stir among the lamas, and we dashed away like\r\nfrightened rabbits, dodging behind the gateposts until we were safe\r\noutside. It was not until some days later that we learned what a really\r\ndangerous thing it was to do, for the temple is one of the holiest in\r\nUrga, and in it women are never allowed. Had a Mongol seen us, our camp\r\nwould have been stormed by a mob of frenzied lamas.\r\n\r\nA few days later we had an experience which demonstrates how quickly\r\ntrouble can arise where religious superstitions are involved. My wife\r\nand I had put the motion picture camera in one of the carts and, with\r\nour Mongol driving, went to the summit of the hill above the Lama City\r\nto film a panoramic view of Urga. We, ourselves, were on horseback.\r\nAfter getting the pictures, we drove down the main street of the city\r\nand stopped before the largest temple, which I had photographed several\r\ntimes before.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the motion picture machine was in position, about five\r\nhundred lamas gathered about us. It was a good-natured crowd, however,\r\nand we had almost finished work, when a \"black Mongol\" (i.e., one with\r\na queue, not a lama) pushed his way among the priests and began to\r\nharangue them violently. In a few moments he boldly grasped me by the\r\narm. Fearing that trouble might arise, I smiled and said, in Chinese,\r\nthat we were going away. The Mongol began to gesticulate wildly and\r\nattempted to pull me with him farther into the crowd of lamas, who\r\nalso were becoming excited. I was being separated from Yvette, and\r\nrealizing that it would be dangerous to get far away from her, I\r\nsuddenly wrenched my arm free and threw the Mongol to the ground; then\r\nI rushed through the line of lamas surrounding Yvette, and we backed up\r\nagainst the cart.\r\n\r\nI had an automatic pistol in my pocket, but it would have been suicide\r\nto shoot except as a last resort. When a Mongol \"starts anything\" he is\r\nsure to finish it; he is not like a Chinese, who will usually run at\r\nthe first shot. We stood for at least three minutes with that wall of\r\nscowling brutes ten feet away. They were undecided what to do and were\r\nonly waiting for a leader to close in. One huge beast over six feet\r\ntall was just in front of me, and as I stood with my fingers crooked\r\nabout the trigger of the automatic in my pocket, I thought, \"If you\r\nstart, I'm going to nail you anyway.\"\r\n\r\nJust at this moment of indecision our Mongol leaped on my wife's pony,\r\nshouted that he was going to Duke Loobitsan Yangsen, an influential\r\nfriend of ours, and dashed away. Instantly attention turned from us to\r\nhim. Fifty men were on horseback in a second, flying after him at full\r\nspeed. I climbed into the cart, shouting to Yvette to jump on Kublai\r\nKhan and run; but she would not leave me. At full speed we dashed down\r\nthe hill, the plunging horses scattering lamas right and left. Our\r\nyoung Mongol had saved us from a situation which momentarily might have\r\nbecome critical.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the main street of Urga below the Lama City I saw\r\nthe black Mongol who had started all the trouble. I jumped to the\r\nground, seized him by the collar and one leg, and attempted to throw\r\nhim into the cart for I had a little matter to settle with him which\r\ncould best be done to my satisfaction where we were without spectators.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant a burly policeman, wearing a saber fully five feet\r\nlong, seized my horse by the bridle. At the black Mongol's instigation\r\n(who, I discovered, was himself a policeman) he had been waiting to\r\narrest us when we came into the city. Since it was impossible to learn\r\nwhat had caused the trouble, Yvette rode to Andersen, Meyer's compound\r\nto bring back Mr. Olufsen and his interpreter. She found the whole\r\ncourtyard swarming with excited Mongol soldiers. A few moments later\r\nOlufsen arrived, and we were allowed to return to his house on parole.\r\nThen he visited the Foreign Minister, who telephoned the police that we\r\nwere not to be molested further.\r\n\r\nWe could never satisfactorily determine what it was all about for\r\nevery one had a different story. The most plausible explanation was\r\nas follows. Russians had been rather _persona non grata_ in Urga\r\nsince the collapse of the empire, and the Mongols were ready to annoy\r\nthem whenever it was possible to do so and \"get away with it.\" All\r\nforeigners are supposed to be Russians by the average native and, when\r\nthe black Mongol discovered us using a strange machine, he thought it\r\nan excellent opportunity to \"show off\" before the lamas. Therefore, he\r\ntold them that we were casting a spell over the great temple by means\r\nof the motion picture camera which I was swinging up and down and from\r\nside to side. This may not be the true explanation of the trouble but\r\nat least it was the one which sounded most logical to us.\r\n\r\nOur lama had been caught in the city, and it was with difficulty that\r\nwe were able to obtain his release. The police charged that he tried to\r\nescape when they ordered him to stop. He related how they had slapped\r\nhis face and pulled his ears before they allowed him to leave the\r\njail, and he was a very much frightened young man when he appeared at\r\nAndersen, Meyer's compound. However, he was delighted to have escaped\r\nso easily, as he had had excellent prospects of spending a week or two\r\nin one of the prison coffins.\r\n\r\nThe whole performance had the gravest possibilities, and we were\r\nexceedingly fortunate in not having been seriously injured or killed.\r\nBy playing upon their superstitions, the black Mongol had so inflamed\r\nthe lamas that they were ready for anything. I should never have\r\nallowed them to separate me from my wife and, to prevent it, probably\r\nwould have had to use my pistol. Had I begun to shoot, death for both\r\nof us would have been inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe day that we arrived in Urga from the plains we found the city\r\nflooded. The great square in front of the horse market was a\r\nchocolate-colored lake; a brown torrent was rushing down the main\r\nstreet; and every alley was two feet deep in water, or a mass of\r\nliquid mud. It was impossible to walk without wading to the knees and\r\neven our horses floundered and slipped about, covering us with mud and\r\nwater. The river valley, too, presented quite a different picture than\r\nwhen we had seen it last. Instead of open sweeps of grassland dotted\r\nwith an occasional _yurt_, now there were hundreds of felt dwellings\r\ninterspersed with tents of white or blue. It was like the encampment of\r\na great army, or a collection of huge beehives.\r\n\r\nMost of the inhabitants were Mongols from the city who had pitched\r\ntheir _yurts_ in the valley for the summer. Although the wealthiest\r\nnatives seem to feel that for the reception of guests their \"position\"\r\ndemands a foreign house, they seldom live in it. Duke Loobitsan Yangsen\r\nhad completed his mansion the previous winter. It was built in Russian\r\nstyle and furnished with an assortment of hideous rugs and foreign\r\nfurniture which made one shiver. But in the yard behind the house his\r\n_yurt_ was pitched, and there he lived in comfort.\r\n\r\nLoobitsan was a splendid fellow--one of the best types of Mongol\r\naristocrats. From the crown of his finely molded head to the toes of\r\nhis pointed boots, he was every inch a duke. I saw him in his house\r\none day reclining on a hang while he received half a dozen minor\r\nofficials, and his manner of quiet dignity and conscious power recalled\r\naccounts of the Mongol princes as Marco Polo saw them. Loobitsan liked\r\nforeigners and one could always find a cordial reception in his\r\ncompound. He spoke excellent Chinese and was unusually well educated\r\nfor a Mongol.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was in charge of the customs station at Mai-ma-cheng\r\nand owned considerable property, which he rented to the Chinese for\r\nvegetable gardens, his chief wealth was in horses. In Mongolia a man's\r\nworldly goods are always measured in horses, not in dollars. When he\r\nneeds cash he sells a pony or two and buys more if he has any surplus\r\nsilver. His bank is the open plain; his herdsmen are the guardians of\r\nhis riches.\r\n\r\nLoobitsan's wife, the duchess, was a nice-looking woman who seemed\r\nrather bored with life. She rejoiced in two gorgeous strings of pearls,\r\nwhich on state occasions hung from the silver-encrusted horns of hair\r\nto the shoulders of her brocade jacket. Ordinarily she appeared in a\r\nloose red gown and hardly looked regal.\r\n\r\nLoobitsan had never seen Peking and was anxious to go. When General\r\nHsu Shu-tseng made his _coup d'etat_ in November, 1919, Mr. Larsen\r\nand Loobitsan came to the capital as representatives of the Hutukhtu,\r\nand one day, as my wife was stepping into a millinery shop on Rue\r\nMarco Polo, she met him dressed in all his Mongol splendor. But he was\r\nso closely chaperoned by Chinese officials that he could not enjoy\r\nhimself. I saw Larsen not long afterward, and he told me that Loobitsan\r\nwas already pining for the open plains of his beloved Mongolia.\r\n\r\nIn mid-July, when we returned to Urga, the vegetable season was at\r\nits height. The Chinese, of course, do all the gardening; and the\r\nsplendid radishes, beets, onions, carrots, cabbages, and beans, which\r\nwere brought every day to market, showed the wonderful possibilities\r\nfor development along these lines. North of the Bogdo-ol there is a\r\nsuperabundance of rain and vegetables grow so rapidly in the rich soil\r\nthat they are deliciously sweet and tender, besides being of enormous\r\nsize. While we were on the plains our food had consisted largely of\r\nmeat and we reveled in the change of diet. We wished often for fruit\r\nbut that is nonexistent in Mongolia except a few, hard, watery pears,\r\nwhich merchants import from China.\r\n\r\nMr. Larsen was in Kalgan for the summer but Mr. Olufsen turned over\r\nhis house and compound for our work. I am afraid we bothered him\r\nunmercifully, yet his good nature was unfailing and he was never too\r\nbusy to assist us in the innumerable details of packing the specimens\r\nwe had obtained upon the plains and in preparing for our trip into the\r\nforests north of Urga. It is men like him who make possible scientific\r\nwork in remote corners of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nMONGOLS AT HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil we left Urga the second time Mongolia, to us, had meant only the\r\nGobi Desert and the boundless, rolling plains. When we set our faces\r\nnorthward we found it was also a land of mountains and rivers, of\r\nsomber forests and gorgeous flowers.\r\n\r\nA new forest always thrills me mightily. Be it of stately northern\r\npines, or a jungle tangle in the tropics, it is so filled with glamour\r\nand mystery that I enter it with a delightful feeling of expectation.\r\nThere is so much that is concealed from view, it is so pregnant with\r\nthe possibility of surprises, that I am as excited as a child on\r\nChristmas morning.\r\n\r\nThe forests of Mongolia were by no means disappointing. We entered them\r\njust north of Urga where the Siberian life zone touches the plains of\r\nthe central Asian region and the beginnings of a new fauna are sharply\r\ndelineated by the limit of the trees. We had learned that the Terelche\r\nRiver would offer a fruitful collecting ground. It was only forty miles\r\nfrom Urga and the first day's trip was a delight. We traveled northward\r\nup a branch valley enclosed by forested hills and carpeted with\r\nflowers. Never had we seen such flowers! Acre after acre of bluebells,\r\nforget-me-nots, daisies, buttercups, and cowslips converted the entire\r\nvalley into a vast \"old-fashioned garden,\" radiantly beautiful. Our\r\ncamp that night was at the base of a mountain called the Da Wat which\r\nshut us off from the Terelche River.\r\n\r\nOn the second morning, instead of golden sunshine, we awoke to a\r\ncloud-hung sky and floods of rain. It was one of those days when\r\neverything goes wrong; when with all your heart you wish to swear but\r\ninstead you must smile and smile and keep on smiling. No one wished\r\nto break camp in the icy deluge but there were three marshes between\r\nus and the Terelche River which were bad enough in dry weather. A few\r\nhours of rain would make them impassable, perhaps for weeks.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I look back upon that day and the next as one of our few,\r\nreal hardships. After eight hours of killing work, wet to the skin\r\nand almost frozen, we crossed the first dangerous swamp and reached\r\nthe summit of the mountain. Then the cart, with our most valuable\r\npossessions, plunged off the road on a sharp descent and crashed into\r\nthe forest below. Chen and I escaped death by a miracle and the other\r\nChinese taxidermist, who was safe and sound, promptly had hysterics. It\r\nwas discouraging, to say the least. We camped in the gathering darkness\r\non a forty-five-degree slope in mud twelve inches deep. Next day we\r\ngathered up our scattered belongings, repaired the cart, and reached\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nI had a letter from Duke Loobitsan Yangsen to a famous old hunter,\r\nTserin Dorchy by name, who lives in the Terelche region. He had been\r\ngone for six days on a shooting trip when we came into the beautiful\r\nvalley where his _yurts_ were pitched, but his wife welcomed us with\r\ntrue Mongolian hospitality and a great dish of cheese. Our own camp we\r\nmade just within the forest, a mile away.\r\n\r\nFor a week we hunted and trapped in the vicinity, awaiting Tserin\r\nDorchy's return. Our arrival created a deal of interest among the half\r\ndozen families in the neighborhood and, after each had paid a formal\r\ncall, they apparently agreed that we were worthy of being accepted\r\ninto their community. We were nomads for the time, just as they are\r\nfor life. We had pitched our tents in the forest, as they had erected\r\ntheir _yurts_ in the meadow beside the river. When the biting winds of\r\nwinter swept the valley a few months later they would move, with all\r\ntheir sheep and goats, to the shelter of the hills and we would seek\r\nnew hunting grounds.\r\n\r\nBefore many days we learned all the valley gossip. Moreover, we\r\nfurnished some ourselves for one of the Chinese taxidermists became\r\nenamored of a Mongol maiden. There were two of them, to be exact,\r\nand they both \"vamped\" him persistently. The toilettes with which\r\nthey sought to allure him were marvels of brilliance, and one of them\r\nactually scrubbed her little face and hands with a cake of my yellow,\r\nscented soap.\r\n\r\nOur servant's affections finally centered upon the younger girl and\r\nI smiled paternally upon the wild-wood romance. Every night, with a\r\nsheepish grin, Chen would ask to borrow a pony. The responsibilities\r\nof chaperones sat lightly on our shoulders, but sometimes my wife and I\r\nwould wander out to the edge of the forest and watch him to the bottom\r\nof the hill. Usually his love was waiting and they would ride off\r\ntogether in the moonlight--where, we never asked!\r\n\r\nBut we could not blame the boy--those Mongolian nights were made for\r\nlovers. The marvel of them we hold among our dearest memories. Wherever\r\nwe may be, the fragrance of pine trees or the sodden smell of a marsh\r\ncarries us back in thought to the beautiful valley and fills our hearts\r\nagain with the glory of its clear, white nights.\r\n\r\nNo matter what the day brought forth, we looked forward to the evening\r\nhunt as best of all. As we trotted our ponies homeward through the\r\nfresh, damp air we could watch the shadows deepen in the somber\r\nmasses of the forest, and on the hilltops see the ragged silhouettes\r\nof sentinel pines against the rose glow of the sky. Ribbons of mist,\r\nweaving in and out above the stream, clothed the alders in ghostly\r\nsilver and rested in billowy masses upon the marshes. Ere the moon had\r\nrisen, the stars blazed out like tiny lanterns in the sky. Over all the\r\nvalley there was peace unutterable.\r\n\r\nWe were soon admitted to a delightful comradeship with the Mongols of\r\nour valley. We shared their joys and sorrows and nursed their minor\r\nills. First to seek our aid was the wife of the absent hunter, Tserin\r\nDorchy. She rode up one day with a two-year-old baby on her arm. The\r\nlittle fellow was badly infected with eczema, and for three weeks one\r\nof the lamas in the tiny temple near their _yurt_ had been mumbling\r\nprayers and incantations in his behalf, without avail. Fortunately,\r\nI had a supply of zinc ointment and before the month was ended the\r\nbaby was almost well. Then came the lama with his bill \"for services\r\nrendered,\" and Tserin Dorchy contributed one hundred dollars to his\r\npriestly pocket. A young Mongol with a dislocated shoulder was my next\r\npatient, and when I had made him whole, the lama again claimed the\r\ncredit and collected fifty dollars as the honorarium for his prayers.\r\nAnd so it continued throughout the summer; I made the cures, and the\r\npriest got the fees.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Mongols all admitted the efficacy of my foreign medicines,\r\nnevertheless they could not bring themselves to dispense with the lama\r\nand his prayers. Superstition was too strong and fear that the priest\r\nwould send an army of evil spirits flocking to their _yurts_ if they\r\noffended him brought the money, albeit reluctantly, from their pockets.\r\nAlthough the lama never proposed a partnership arrangement, as I\r\nthought he might have done, he spent much time about our camp and often\r\nbrought us bowls of curded milk and cheese. He was a wandering priest\r\nand not a permanent resident of the valley, but he evidently decided\r\nnot to wander any farther until we, too, should leave, for he was with\r\nus until the very end.\r\n\r\nA short time after we had made our camp near the Terelche River a\r\nmessenger arrived from Urga with a huge package of mail. In it was a\r\ncopy of _Harper's Magazine_ containing an account of a flying visit\r\nwhich I had made to Urga in September, 1918.[1] There were half a dozen\r\nMongols near our tent, among whom was Madame Tserin Dorchy. I explained\r\nthe pictures to the hunter's wife in my best Chinese while Yvette\r\n\"stood by\" with her camera and watched results. Although the woman\r\nhad visited Urga several times she had never seen a photograph or a\r\nmagazine and for ten minutes there was no reaction. Then she recognized\r\na Mongol headdress similar to her own. With a gasp of astonishment\r\nshe pointed it out to the others and burst into a perfect torrent of\r\nguttural expletives. A picture of the great temple at Urga, where she\r\nonce had gone to worship, brought forth another volume of Mongolian\r\nadjectives and her friends literally fought for places in the front row.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Harper's Magazine_, June, 1919, pp. 1-16.]\r\n\r\nNews travels quickly in Mongolia and during the next week men and women\r\nrode in from _yurts_ forty or fifty miles away to see that magazine.\r\nI will venture to say that no American publication ever received more\r\nappreciation or had a more picturesque audience than did that copy of\r\n_Harper's_.\r\n\r\nThe absent Tserin Dorchy returned one day when I was riding down the\r\nvalley with his wife. We saw two strange figures on horseback emerging\r\nfrom the forest, each with a Russian rifle on his back. Their saddles\r\nwere strung about with half-dried skins--four roebuck, a musk deer, a\r\nmoose, and a pair of elk antlers in the \"velvet.\"\r\n\r\nPLATE XI\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUR BASE CAMP AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MONGOL VILLAGE OF THE TERELCHE VALLEY]\r\n\r\nWith a joyful shout Madame Tserin Dorchy rode toward her husband. He\r\nwas an oldish man, of fifty-five years perhaps, with a face as dried\r\nand weather-beaten as the leather beneath his saddle. He may have been\r\nglad to see her but his only sign of greeting was a \"_sai_\" and a nod\r\nto include us both. Her pleasure was undisguised, however, and as we\r\nrode down the valley she chattered volubly between the business of\r\ndriving in half a dozen horses and a herd of sheep. The monosyllabic\r\nreplies of the hunter were delivered in a voice which seemed to come\r\nfrom a long way off or from out of the earth beneath his pony's feet.\r\nI was interested to see what greeting there would be upon his arrival\r\nat the _yurt_. His two daughters and his infant son were waiting at the\r\ndoor but he had not even a word for them and only a pat upon the head\r\nfor the baby.\r\n\r\nAll Mongols are independent but Tserin Dorchy was an extreme in every\r\nway. He ruled the half dozen families in the valley like an autocrat.\r\nWhat he commanded was done without a question. I was anxious to get\r\naway and announced that we would start the day after his arrival. \"No,\"\r\nsaid he, \"we will go two days from now.\" Argument was of no avail.\r\nSo far as he was concerned, the matter was closed. When it came to\r\narranging wages he stated his terms, which were exorbitant. I could\r\naccept them or not as I pleased; he would not reduce his demands by a\r\nsingle copper.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, offers of money make little impression upon the\r\nordinary Mongols. They produce well-nigh everything they need for they\r\ndress in sheepskins during the winter and eat little else than mutton.\r\nWhen they want cloth, tea, or ammunition, they simply sell a sheep or a\r\npony or barter with the Chinese merchants.\r\n\r\nWe found that the personal equation enters very largely into any\r\ndealings with a Mongol. If he likes you, remuneration is an incident.\r\nIf he is not interested, money does not tempt him. His independence is\r\na product of the wild, free life upon the plains. He relies entirely\r\nupon himself for he has learned that in the struggle for existence, it\r\nis he himself that counts. Of the Chinaman, the opposite is true. His\r\nlife is one of the community and he depends upon his family and his\r\nvillage. He is gregarious above all else and he hates to live alone.\r\nIn this dependence upon his fellow men he knows that money counts--and\r\nthere is very little that a Chinaman will not do for money.\r\n\r\nOn one of his trips across Mongolia, Mr. Coltman's car became badly\r\nmired within a stone's throw of a Mongol _yurt_. Two or three oxen were\r\ngrazing in front of the house and Coltman asked the native to pull his\r\ncar out of the mud. The Mongol, who was comfortably smoking his pipe in\r\nthe sun, was not at all interested in the matter, but finally remarked\r\ncasually that he would do it for eight dollars. There was no argument.\r\nEight dollars was what he said, and eight dollars it would have to be\r\nor he would not move. The entire operation of dragging the car to firm\r\nground consumed just four minutes. But this instance was an exception\r\nfor usually a Mongol is the very essence of good nature and is ready to\r\nassist whenever a traveler is in difficulty.\r\n\r\nTserin Dorchy's independence kept us in a constant state of irritation\r\nfor it was manifested in a dozen different ways. We would gladly have\r\ndispensed with his services but his word was law in the community\r\nand, if he had issued a \"bull\" against us, we could not have obtained\r\nanother man. For all his age, he was an excellent hunter and we came to\r\nbe good friends.\r\n\r\nThe old man's independence once led him into serious trouble. He had\r\noften looked at the Bogdo-ol with longing eyes and had made short\r\nexcursions, without his gun, into its sacred forests. On one of these\r\ntrips he saw a magnificent elk with antlers such as he had never\r\ndreamed were carried by any living animal. He could not forget that\r\ndeer. Its memory was a thorn that pricked him wherever else he hunted.\r\nFinally he determined to have it, even if Mongolian law and the Lama\r\nChurch had proclaimed it sacred.\r\n\r\nToward the end of July, when he deemed the antlers just ripe for\r\nplucking, he slipped into the forest during the night and climbed\r\nthe mountain. After two days he killed the elk. But the lamas who\r\npatrol \"God's Mountain\" had heard the shot and drove him into a great\r\nrock-strewn gorge where they lost his trail. Believing that he was\r\nstill within hearing distance, they shouted to one another that it\r\nwas useless to hunt longer and that they had best return. Then they\r\nconcealed themselves and awaited results. An hour later Tserin Dorchy\r\ncrawled out from under a bowlder directly into their hands.\r\n\r\nHe had been well-nigh killed before the lamas brought him down to Urga\r\nand was still unconscious when they dumped him unceremoniously into\r\none of the prison coffins. He was sentenced to remain a year; but the\r\nold man would not have lived a month if Duke Loobitsan Yangsen, with\r\nwhom he had often hunted, had not obtained his release. His independent\r\nspirit is by no means chastened, however, and I feel sure that he will\r\nshoot another deer on the Bogdo-ol before he dies!\r\n\r\nThree days after his return home, my wife and I left with him and three\r\nother Mongols on our first real hunt. Our equipment consisted only of\r\nsleeping bags and such food as could be carried on our horses; it was\r\na time when living \"close to nature\" was really necessary. Eight miles\r\naway we stopped at the entrance to a tiny valley. By arranging a bit of\r\ncanvas over the low branches of a larch tree we prepared a shelter for\r\nourselves and another for the hunters.\r\n\r\nIn fifteen minutes camp was ready and a fire blazing. When a huge iron\r\nbasin of water had begun to warm one of the Mongols threw in a handful\r\nof brick tea, which resembled nothing so much as powdered tobacco.\r\nAfter the black fluid had boiled vigorously for ten minutes each one\r\nfilled his wooden eating bowl, put in a great chunk of rancid butter,\r\nand then a quantity of finely-ground meal. This is what the Tibetans\r\ncall _tsamba_, and the buttered tea was prepared exactly as we had seen\r\nthe Tibetans make it. The _tsamba_, however, was only to enable them to\r\n\"carry on\" until we killed some game; for meat is the Mongols' \"staff\r\nof life,\" and they care little for anything except animal food.\r\n\r\nThe evening hunt yielded no results. Two of the Mongols had missed a\r\nbear, I had seen a roebuck, and the old man had lost a wounded musk\r\ndeer on the mountain ridge above the camp. But the game was there and\r\nwe knew where to find it on the morrow. In the gray light of early\r\nmorning Tserin Dorchy and I rode up the valley through the dew-soaked\r\ngrass. Once the old man stopped to examine the rootings of a _ga-hai_\r\n(wild boar), then he continued steadily along the stream bed. In the\r\nhalf-gloom of the forest the bushes and trees seemed flat and colorless\r\nbut suddenly the sun burned through an horizon cloud, flooding the\r\nwoods with golden light. The whole forest seemed instantly to awaken.\r\nIt was as though we had come into a dimly lighted room and touched an\r\nelectric switch. The trees and bushes assumed a dozen subtle shades of\r\ngreen, and the flowers blazed like jewels in the gorgeous wood-land\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\nI should have liked to spend the morning in the forest but we knew\r\nthe deer were feeding in the open. On foot we climbed upward through\r\nknee-high grass to the summit of a hill. There seemed nothing living in\r\nthe meadow but as we walked along the ridge a pair of grouse shot into\r\nthe air followed by half a dozen chicks which buzzed away like brown\r\nbullets to the shelter of the trees. We crossed a flat depression and\r\nrested for a moment on a rounded hilltop. Below us a new valley sloped\r\ndownward, bathed in sunshine. Tserin Dorchy wandered slowly to the\r\nright while I studied the edge of a marsh with my glasses.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I heard the muffled beat of hoofs. Jerking the glasses from\r\nmy eyes I saw a huge roebuck, crowned with a splendid pair of antlers,\r\nbound into view not thirty feet away. For the fraction of a second he\r\nstopped, with his head thrown back, then dashed along the hillside.\r\nThat instant of hesitation gave me just time to seize my rifle, catch a\r\nglimpse of the yellow-red body through the rear sight, and fire as he\r\ndisappeared. Leaping to my feet, I saw four slender legs waving in the\r\nair. The bullet had struck him in the shoulder and he was down for good.\r\n\r\nMy heart pounded with exultation as I lifted his magnificent head. He\r\nwas the finest buck I had ever seen and I gloated over his body as a\r\nmiser handles his gold. And gold, shining in the sunlight, was never\r\nmore beautiful than his spotless summer coat.\r\n\r\nRight where he lay upon the hillside, amid a veritable garden of\r\nbluebells, daisies, and yellow roses, was the setting for the group we\r\nwished to prepare in the American Museum of Natural History. He would\r\nbe its central figure for his peer could not be found in all Mongolia.\r\n\r\nAs I stood there in the brilliant sunlight, mentally planning the\r\ngroup, I thought how fortunate I was to have been born a naturalist. A\r\nsportsman shoots a deer and takes its head; later, it hangs above his\r\nfireplace or in the trophy room. If he be one of imagination, in years\r\nto come it will bring back to him the feel of the morning air, the\r\nfragrance of the pine trees, and the wild thrill of exultation as the\r\nbuck went down. But it is a memory picture only and limited to himself.\r\nThe mounted head can never bring to others the smallest part of the joy\r\nhe felt and the scene he saw.\r\n\r\nThe naturalist shares his pleasure and, after all, it is largely that\r\nwhich counts. When the group is constructed in the Museum under his\r\ndirection he can see reproduced with fidelity and in minutest detail\r\nthis hidden corner of the world. He can share with thousands of city\r\ndwellers the joy of his hunt and teach them something of the animals he\r\nloves and the lands they call their own.\r\n\r\nTo his scientific training he owes another source of pleasure. Every\r\nanimal is a step in the solution of some one of nature's problems.\r\nPerhaps it is a new discovery, a species unknown to science. Asia is\r\nfull of such surprises--I have already found many. Be the specimen\r\nlarge or small, if it has fallen to your trap or rifle, there is the\r\nthrill of knowing that you have traced one more small line on the white\r\nportion of nature's map.\r\n\r\nWhile I was gazing at the fallen buck Tserin Dorchy stood like a statue\r\non the hilltop, scanning the forest and valley with the hope that my\r\nshot had disturbed another animal. In a few moments he came down to\r\nme. The old man had lost some of his accustomed calm and, with thumb\r\nupraised, murmured, \"_Sai, sai._\" Then he gave, in vivid pantomime, a\r\nrecital of how he suddenly surprised the buck feeding just below the\r\nhill crest and how he had seen me jerk the glasses from my eyes and\r\nshoot.\r\n\r\nSitting down beside the deer we went through the ceremony of a smoke.\r\nThen Tserin Dorchy eviscerated the animal, being careful to preserve\r\nthe heart, liver, stomach, and intestines. Like all other Orientals\r\nwith whom I have hunted, the Mongols boiled and ate the viscera as soon\r\nas we reached camp and seemed to consider them an especial delicacy.\r\n\r\nSome weeks later we killed two elk and Tserin Dorchy inflated and dried\r\nthe intestines. These were to be used as containers for butter and\r\nmutton fat. After tanning the stomach he manufactured from it a bag to\r\ncontain milk or other liquids. His wife showed me some really beautiful\r\nleather which she had made from roebuck skins. Tanning hides and making\r\nfelt were the only strictly Mongolian industries which we observed in\r\nthe region visited by our expedition. The Mongols do a certain amount\r\nof logging and charcoal burning and in the autumn they cut hay; but\r\nwith these exceptions we never saw them do any work which could not be\r\ndone from horseback.\r\n\r\nOur first hunting trip lasted ten days and in the following months\r\nthere were many others. We became typical nomads, spending a day\r\nor two in some secluded valley only to move again to other hunting\r\ngrounds. For the time we were Mongols in all essentials. The primitive\r\ninstincts, which lie just below the surface in us all, responded to\r\nthe subtle lure of nature and without an effort we slipped into the\r\ncare-free life of these children of the woods and plains.\r\n\r\nWe slept at night under starlit skies in the clean, fresh forest; the\r\nfirst gray light of dawn found us stealing through the dew-soaked grass\r\non the trail of elk, moose, boar or deer; and when the sun was high,\r\nlike animals, we spent the hours in sleep until the lengthening shadows\r\nsent us out again for the evening hunt. In those days New York seemed\r\nto be on another planet and very, very far away. Happiness and a great\r\npeace was ours, such as those who dwell in cities can never know.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of our second hunt the Mongols suddenly announced that\r\nthey must return to the Terelche Valley. We did not want to go, but\r\nTserin Dorchy was obdurate. With the limited Chinese at our command we\r\ncould not learn the reason, and at the base camp Lü, \"the interpreter,\"\r\nwas wholly incoherent. \"To-morrow, plenty Mongol come,\" he said.\r\n\"Riding pony, all same Peking. Two men catch hold, both fall down.\" My\r\nwife was perfectly sure that he had lost his mind, but by a flash of\r\nintuition I got his meaning. K was to be a field meet. \"Riding pony,\r\nall same Peking\" meant races, and \"two men catch hold, both fall down\"\r\ncould be nothing else than wrestling. I was very proud of myself, and\r\nLü was immensely relieved.\r\n\r\nAthletic contests are an integral part of the life of every Mongol\r\ncommunity, as I knew, and the members of our valley family were to\r\nhold their annual games. At Urga, in June, the great meet which\r\nthe Living God blesses with his presence is an amazing spectacle,\r\nreminiscent of the pageants of the ancient emperors. All the _élite_ of\r\nMongolia gather on the banks of the Tola River, dressed in their most\r\nsplendid robes, and the archery, wrestling, and horse racing are famous\r\nthroughout the East.\r\n\r\nThis love of sport is one of the most attractive characteristics of the\r\nMongols. It is a common ground on which a foreigner immediately has\r\na point of contact. The Chinese, on the contrary, despise all forms\r\nof physical exercise. They consider it \"bad form,\" and they do not\r\nunderstand any sport which calls for violent exertion. They prefer to\r\ntake a quiet walk, carrying their pet bird in a cage for an airing; to\r\nplay a game of cards; or, if they must travel, to loll back in a sedan\r\nchair, with the curtains drawn and every breath of air excluded.\r\n\r\nThe Terelche Valley meet was held on a flat strip of ground just below\r\nour camp. As my wife and I rode out of the forest, a dozen Mongols\r\nswept by, gorgeous in flaming red and streaming peacock plumes. They\r\nwaved a challenge to us, and we joined them in a wild race to a flag\r\nin the center of the field. On the side of the hill sat a row of lamas\r\nin dazzling yellow gowns; opposite them were the judges, among whom\r\nI recognized Tserin Dorchy, though he was so bedecked, behatted and\r\nberibboned that I could hardly realize that it was the same old fellow\r\nwith whom we had lived in camp. (I presume if he saw me in the clothes\r\nof civilization he would be equally surprised.)\r\n\r\nIn front of the judges, who represented the most respected laity of the\r\ncommunity, were bowls of cheese cut into tiny cubes. The spectators\r\nconsisted of two groups of women, who sat some distance apart in\r\ncompact masses, the \"horns\" of their headdresses almost interlocked.\r\nTheir costumes were marvels of brilliance. They looked like a flock of\r\ngorgeous butterflies, which had alighted for a moment on the grass.\r\n\r\nThe first race consisted of about a dozen ponies, ridden by\r\nfourteen-year-old boys and girls. They swept up the valley from the\r\nstarting point in full run, hair streaming, and uttering wailing yells.\r\nThe winner was led by two old Mongols to the row of lamas, before whom\r\nhe prostrated himself twice, and received a handful of cheese. This he\r\nscattered broadcast, as he was conducted ceremoniously to the judges,\r\nfrom whom he returned with palms brimming with bits of cheese.\r\n\r\nFinally, all the contestants in the races, and half a dozen of the\r\nMongols on horseback, lined up in front of the priests, each one\r\nsinging a barbaric chant. Then they circled about the lamas, beating\r\ntheir horses until they were in a full run. After the race came\r\nwrestling matches. The contestants sparred for holds and when finally\r\nclinched, each with a grip on the other's waistband, endeavored to\r\nobtain a fall by suddenly heaving. When the last wrestling match was\r\nfinished, a tall Mongol raised the yellow banner, and followed by every\r\nman and boy on horseback, circled about the seated lamas. Faster and\r\nfaster they rode, yelling like demons, and then strung off across the\r\nvalley to the nearest _yurt_.\r\n\r\nAlthough the sports in themselves were not remarkable, the scene was\r\npicturesque in the extreme. Opposite to the grassy hill the forest-clad\r\nmountains rose, tier upon tier, in dark green masses. The brilliant\r\nyellow lamas faced by the Mongols in their blazing robes and pointed\r\nyellow hats, the women, flashing with \"jewels\" and silver, the\r\nhalf-wild chant, and the rush of horses, gave a barbaric touch which\r\nthrilled and fascinated us. We could picture this same scene seven\r\nhundred years ago, for it is an ancient custom which has come down from\r\nthe days of Kublai Khan. It was as though the veil of centuries had\r\nbeen lifted for a moment to allow us to carry away, in motion pictures,\r\nthis drama of Mongolian life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nNOMADS OF THE FOREST\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days after the field meet we left with Tserin Dorchy and two\r\nother Mongols for a wapiti hunt. We rode along the Terelche River for\r\nthree miles, sometimes splashing through the soggy edges of a marsh,\r\nand again halfway up a hillside where the ground was firm and hard;\r\nthen, turning west on a mountain slope, we came to a low plateau which\r\nrolled away in undulating sweeps of hush-land between the edges of the\r\ndark pine woods. It was a truly boreal landscape; we were on the edge\r\nof the forest, which stretches in a vast, rolling sea of green far\r\nbeyond the Siberian frontier.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of the table-land we descended between dark walls of\r\npine trees to a beautiful valley filled with parklike openings. Just\r\nat dark Tserin Dorchy turned abruptly into the stream and crossed to a\r\npretty grove of spruces on a little island formed by two branches of\r\nthe river. It was as secluded as a cavern, and made an ideal place in\r\nwhich to camp. A hundred feet away the tent was invisible and, save for\r\nthe tiny wreaths of smoke which curled above the tree-tops, there was\r\nno sign of our presence there.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Tserin Dorchy shouldered a pack of skins and went to a\r\n\"salt lick\" in a meadow west of camp to spend the night. He returned\r\nin the first gray light of dawn, just as I was making coffee, and\r\nreported that he had heard wapiti barking, but that no animals had\r\nvisited the lick. He directed me to go along the hillsides north of\r\ncamp, while the Mongol hunters struck westward across the mountains.\r\n\r\nI had not been gone an hour, and had just worked across the lower end\r\nof a deep ravine, when I heard a wapiti bark above and behind me. It\r\nwas a hoarse roar, exactly like a roebuck, except that it was deeper\r\ntoned and louder. I was thrilled as though by an electric current. It\r\nseemed very far away, much farther than it really was, and as I crept\r\nto the summit of a ridge a splendid bull wapiti broke through the\r\nunderbrush. He had been feeding in the bottom of the ravine and saw my\r\nhead instantly as it appeared above the sky line. There was no chance\r\nto shoot because of the heavy cover; and even when he paused for a\r\nmoment on the opposite hillside a screen of tree branches was in my way.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely disgusted with myself, I followed the animal's trail until\r\nit was lost in the heavy forest. The wapiti was gone for good, but on\r\nthe way back to camp I picked up a roebuck which acted as some balm to\r\nmy injured feelings.\r\n\r\nI had climbed to the crest of the mountains enclosing the valley in\r\nwhich we were camped, and was working slowly down the rim of a deep\r\nravine. In my soft leather moccasins I could walk over the springy moss\r\nwithout a sound, and suddenly saw a yellow-red form moving about in a\r\nluxurious growth of grass and tinted leaves. My heart missed a beat,\r\nfor I thought it was a wapiti.\r\n\r\nInstantly I dropped behind a bush and, as the animal moved into the\r\nopen, I saw it was an enormous roebuck bearing a splendid pair of\r\nantlers. I watched him for a moment, then aimed low behind the foreleg\r\nand fired. The deer bounded into the air and rolled to the bottom of\r\nthe ravine, kicking feebly; my bullet had burst the heart. It was one\r\nof the few times I have ever seen an animal instantly killed with a\r\nheart shot for usually they run a few yards, and then suddenly collapse.\r\n\r\nThe buck was almost as large as the first one I had killed with Tserin\r\nDorchy but it had a twisted right antler. Evidently it had been injured\r\nduring the animal's youth and had continued to grow at right angles to\r\nthe head, instead of straight up in the normal way.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached camp I found Yvette busily picking currants in the\r\nbushes beside the stream. Her face and hands were covered with red\r\nstains and she looked like a very naughty little boy who had run\r\naway from school for a day in the woods. Although blueberries grew\r\non every hillside, we never found strawberries, such as the Russians\r\nin Urga gather on the Bogdo-ol, and only one patch of raspberries on\r\na burned-off mountain slope; But the currants were delicious when\r\nsmothered in sugar.\r\n\r\nYvette and I rode out to the spot where I had killed the roebuck to\r\nbring it in on Kublai Khan and before we returned the Mongol hunters\r\nhad reached camp; neither of them had seen game of any kind. During\r\nthe day we discovered some huge trout in the stream almost at our door.\r\nWe had no hooks or hues, but the Mongols devised a way to catch the\r\nfish which brought us food, although it would have made a sportsman\r\nshiver. They built a dam of stones across the stream and one man waded\r\nslowly along, beating the water with a branch to drive the trout out\r\nof the pools into the ripples; then we dashed into the water and tried\r\nto catch them with our hands. At least a dozen got away but we secured\r\nthree by cornering them among the rocks.\r\n\r\nThey were huge trout, nearly three feet long. Unfortunately I was\r\nnot able to preserve any of them and I do not know what species they\r\nrepresented. The Mongols and Chinese often catch the same fish in the\r\nTola River by means of nets and we sometimes bought them in Urga. One,\r\nwhich we put on the scales, weighed nine pounds. Although Ted MacCallie\r\ntried to catch them with a fly at Urga he never had any success but\r\nthey probably would take live bait.\r\n\r\nAugust 20 was our second day in camp. At dawn I was awakened by the\r\npatter of rain on the tent and soon it became a steady downpour. There\r\nwas no use in hunting and I went back to sleep. At seven o'clock Chen,\r\nwho was fussing about the fire, rushed over to say that he could see\r\ntwo wapiti on the opposite mountain. Yvette and I scrambled out of our\r\nsleeping bags just in time to see a doe and a fawn silhouetted against\r\nthe sky rim as they disappeared over the crest. Half an hour later they\r\nreturned, and I tried a stalk but I lost them in the fog and rain.\r\nTserin Dorchy believed that the animals had gone into a patch of forest\r\non the other side of the mountain. We tried to drive them out but the\r\nonly thing that appeared was a four-year-old roebuck which the Mongol\r\nkilled with a single shot.\r\n\r\nPLATE XII\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WRESTLERS AT TERELCHE VALLEY FIELD MEET]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOMEN SPECTATORS AT THE FIELD MEET]\r\n\r\nWe had ridden up the mountain by zigzagging across the slope, but\r\nwhen we started back I was astounded to see Tserin Dorchy keep to his\r\nsaddle. The wet grass was so slippery that I could not even stand erect\r\nand half the time was sliding on my back, while Kublai Khan picked his\r\nway carefully down the steep descent. The Mongol never left his horse\r\ntill we reached camp. Sometimes he even urged the pony to a trot and,\r\nmoreover, had the roebuck strapped behind his saddle. I would not have\r\nridden down that mountain side for all the deer in Mongolia!\r\n\r\nIt had begun to rain in earnest by eleven o'clock, and we spent a\r\nquiet afternoon. There is a charm about a rainy day when one can read\r\ncomfortably and let it pour. The steady patter on the tent gives one\r\nthe delightful sensation of immediately escaping extreme discomfort.\r\nThere is no pleasure in being warm unless the weather is cold; and one\r\nnever realizes how agreeable it is to be dry unless the day is wet.\r\nThis day was very wet indeed. We had a month's accumulation of unopened\r\nmagazines which a Mongol had brought to our base camp just before\r\nwe left, so there was no chance of being bored. The fire had been\r\nbuilt half under a huge, back-log which kept a cheery glow of coals\r\nthroughout all the downpour, and Chen made us \"_chowdzes_\"--delicious\r\nlittle balls of meat mixed with onions and seasoned with Chinese sauce.\r\nThe Mongols slept and ate and slept some more. We ate and slept and\r\nread. Therefore, we were very happy.\r\n\r\nThe weather during that summer in the forest was a source of constant\r\nsurprise to us. We had never seen such rapid changes from brilliant\r\nsunshine to sheets of rain. For an hour or two the sky might stretch\r\nabove us like a vast blue curtain flecked with tiny masses of\r\nsnow-white clouds. Suddenly, a leaden blanket would spread itself over\r\nevery inch of celestial space, while a rush of rain and wind changed\r\nthe forest to a black chaos of writhing branches and dripping leaves.\r\nIn fifteen minutes the storm would sweep across the mountain tops, and\r\nthe sun would again flood our peaceful valley with the golden light of\r\nearly autumn.\r\n\r\nFor autumn had already reached us even though the season was only\r\nmid-August. It was like October in New York, and we had nightly frosts\r\nwhich withered the countless flowers and turned the leaves to red and\r\ngold. In the morning, when I crossed the meadows to the forest, the\r\ngrass was white with frost and crackled beneath my feet like delicate\r\nthreads of spun glass. My moccasins were powdered with gleaming\r\ncrystals of frozen dew, but at the first touch of sun every twig and\r\nleaf and blade of grass began to drip, as though from a heavy rain. My\r\nfeet and legs waist-high were soaked in half an hour, and at the end of\r\nthe morning hunt I was as wet as though I had waded a dozen rivers.\r\n\r\nOne cannot move on foot in northern Mongolia without the certainty of\r\na thorough wetting. When the sun has dried the dew, there are swamps\r\nand streamlets in every valley and even far up the mountain slopes.\r\nIt is the heavy rainfall, the rich soil, and the brilliant sunshine\r\nthat make northern Mongolia a paradise of luxurious grass and flowers,\r\neven though the real summer lasts only from May till August. Then, the\r\nvalleys are like an exquisite garden and the woods are ablaze with\r\ncolor. Bluebells, their stalks bending under the weight of blossoms,\r\nclothe every hillside in a glorious azure dress bespangled with yellow\r\nroses, daisies, and forget-me-nots. But I think I like the wild\r\npoppies best of all, for their delicate, fragile beauty is wonderfully\r\nappealing. I learned to love them first in Alaska, where their pale,\r\nyellow faces look up happily from the storm-swept hills of the Pribilof\r\nIslands in the Bering Sea.\r\n\r\nBesides its flowers, this northern country is one of exceeding beauty.\r\nThe dark green forests of spruce, larch and pine, broken now and then\r\nby a grove of poplars or silver birches, the secluded valleys and the\r\nrounded hills are strangely restful and give one a sense of infinite\r\npeace. It is a place to go for tired nerves. Ragged peaks, towering\r\nmountains, and yawning chasms, splendid as they are, may be subtly\r\ndisturbing, engendering a feeling of restlessness and vague depression.\r\nThere is none of this in the forests of Mongolia. We felt as though we\r\nmight be happy there all our lives--the mad rush of our other world\r\nseemed very far away and not much worth while.\r\n\r\nAs yet this land has been but lightly touched by the devastating hand\r\nof man. A log road cuts the forest here and there and sometimes we saw\r\na train of ox-carts winding through the trees; but the primitive beauty\r\nof the mountains remains unmarred, save where a hillside has been swept\r\nby fire. In all our wanderings through the forests we saw no evidences\r\nof occupation by the Mongols except the wood roads and a few scattered\r\ncharcoal pits. These were old and moss-grown, and save for ourselves\r\nthe valleys were deserted.\r\n\r\nOne morning while I was hunting north of camp, I heard a wapiti roar\r\non the summit of a mountain. I found its tracks in the soft earth of\r\na game trail which wound through forest so dense that I could hardly\r\nsee a dozen yards. As I stole along the path I heard a sudden sneeze\r\nexactly like that of a human being and saw a small, dark animal dash\r\noff the trail. I stopped instantly and slowly sank to the ground,\r\nkneeling motionless, with my rifle ready. For five minutes I remained\r\nthere--the silence of the forest broken only by the clucking of a\r\nhazel grouse above my head. Then came that sneeze again, sounding even\r\nmore human than before. I heard a nervous patter of tiny hoofs, and\r\nthe animal sneezed from the bushes at my right. I kept as motionless\r\nas a statue, and the sneezes followed each other in rapid succession,\r\naccompanied by impatient stampings and gentle rustlings in the brush.\r\nThen I saw a tiny head emerge from behind a leafy screen and a pair of\r\nbrilliant eyes gazing at me steadily. Very, very slowly I raised the\r\nrifle until the stock nestled against my cheek; then I fired quickly.\r\n\r\nRunning to the spot where the head had been I found a beautiful\r\nbrown-gray animal lying behind a bush. It was no larger than a\r\nhalf-grown fawn, but on either side of its mouth two daggerlike tusks\r\nprojected, slender, sharp and ivory white. It was a musk deer--the\r\nfirst living, wild one I had ever seen. Even before I touched the body\r\nI inhaled a heavy, not unpleasant, odor of musk and discovered the\r\ngland upon the abdomen. It was three inches long and two inches wide,\r\nbut all the hair on the rump and belly was strongly impregnated with\r\nthe odor.\r\n\r\nThese little deer are eagerly sought by the natives throughout the\r\nOrient, as musk is valuable for perfume. In Urga the Mongols could sell\r\na \"pod\" for five dollars (silver) and in other parts of China it is\r\nworth considerably more. When we were in Yün-nan we frequently heard of\r\na musk buyer whom the Paris perfumer, Pinaud, maintained in the remote\r\nmountain village of Atunzi, on the Tibetan frontier.\r\n\r\nBecause of their commercial value the little animals are relentlessly\r\npersecuted in every country which they inhabit and in some places they\r\nhave been completely exterminated. Those in Mongolia are particularly\r\ndifficult to kill, since they live only on the mountain summits in the\r\nthickest forests. Indeed, were it not for their insatiable curiosity it\r\nwould be almost impossible ever to shoot them.\r\n\r\nThey might be snared, of course, but I never saw any traps or devices\r\nfor catching animals which the Mongols used; they seem to depend\r\nentirely upon their guns. This is quite unlike the Chinese, Koreans,\r\nManchus, Malays, and other Orientals with whom I have hunted, for they\r\nall have developed ingenious snares, pitfalls and traps.\r\n\r\nThe musk sac is present only in the male deer and is, of course, for\r\nthe purpose of attracting the does. Unfortunately, it is not possible\r\nto distinguish the sexes except upon close examination, for both are\r\nhornless, and as a result the natives sometimes kill females which they\r\nwould prefer to leave unmolested.\r\n\r\nThe musk deer use their tusks for fighting and also to dig up the food\r\nupon which they live. I frequently found new pine cones which they had\r\ntorn apart to get at the soft centers. During the winter they develop\r\nan exceedingly long, thick coat of hair which, however, is so brittle\r\nthat it breaks almost like dry pine needles; consequently, the skins\r\nhave but little commercial value.\r\n\r\nLate one rainy afternoon Tserin Dorchy and I rode into a beautiful\r\nvalley not far from where we were camped. When well in the upper end,\r\nwe left our horses and proceeded on foot toward the summit of a ridge\r\non which he had killed a bear a month earlier.\r\n\r\nMotioning me to walk to the crest of the ridge from the other side, the\r\nold man vanished like a ghost among the trees. When I was nearly at\r\nthe top I reached the edge of a small patch of burned forest. In the\r\nhalf darkness the charred stumps and skeleton trees were as black as\r\nebony. As I was about to move into the open I saw an object which at\r\nfirst seemed to be a curiously shaped stump. I looked at it casually,\r\nthen something about it arrested my attention. Suddenly a tail switched\r\nnervously and I realized that the \"stump\" was an enormous wild boar\r\nstanding head-on, watching me.\r\n\r\nI fired instantly, but even as I pressed the trigger the animal moved\r\nand I knew that the bullet would never reach its mark. But my brain\r\ncould not telegraph to my finger quickly enough to stop its action\r\nand the boar dashed away unharmed. It was the largest pig I have ever\r\nseen. As he stood on the summit of the ridge he looked almost as big as\r\na Mongol pony. It was too dark to follow the animal so I returned to\r\ncamp, a very dejected man.\r\n\r\nI have never been able to forget that boar and I suppose I never shall.\r\nLater, I killed others but they can never destroy the memory of that\r\nenormous animal as he stood there looking down at me. Had I realized\r\nthat it was a pig only the fraction of a second sooner it would have\r\nbeen a different story. But that is the fortune of shooting. In no\r\nother sport is the line between success and failure so closely drawn;\r\nof course, it is that which makes it so fascinating. At the end of a\r\nlong day's hunt one chance may be given; then all depends on a clear\r\neye, a steady hand and, above all, judgment. In your action in that\r\nsingle golden second rests the success or failure of, perhaps, a\r\nseason's trip. You may have traveled thousands of miles, spent hundreds\r\nof dollars, and had just one shot at the \"head of heads.\"\r\n\r\nSome men tell me that they never get excited when they hunt. Thank\r\nGod, I do. There would be no fun at all for me if I _didn't_ get\r\nexcited. But, fortunately, it all comes after the crucial moment. When\r\nthe stock of the rifle settles against my cheek and I look across the\r\nsights, I am as cold as steel. I can shoot, and keep on shooting, with\r\nevery brain cell concentrated on the work in hand but when it is done,\r\nfor better or worse, I get the reaction which makes it all worth while.\r\n\r\nOne morning, a week after we had been in camp, Tserin Dorchy and I\r\ndiscovered a cow and a calf wapiti feeding in an open forest. It was\r\na delight to see how the old Mongol stalked the deer, slipping from\r\ntree to bush, sometimes on his knees or flat on his face in the soft\r\nmoss carpet. When we were two hundred yards away we drew up behind a\r\nstump. I took the cow, while Tserin Dorchy covered the calf and at the\r\nsound of our rifles both animals went down for good. I was glad to have\r\nthem for specimens because we never got a shot at a bull in Mongolia,\r\nalthough twice I lost one by the merest chance. One of our hunters\r\nbrought in a three-year-old moose a short time after we got the wapiti\r\nand another had a long chase after a wounded bear.\r\n\r\nIt was the first week in September when we returned to the base\r\ncamp, our ponies heavily loaded with skins and antlers. The Chinese\r\ntaxidermists under my direction had made a splendid collection of small\r\nmammals, and we had pretty thoroughly exhausted the resources of the\r\nforests in the Terelche region. Therefore, Yvette and I decided that\r\nit would be well to ride into Urga and make arrangements for our return\r\nto Peking.\r\n\r\nWe did the fifty miles with the greatest ease and spent the night with\r\nMamen in Mai-ma-cheng. Next day Mr. and Mrs. MacCallie arrived, much to\r\nour delight. They were to spend the winter in Urga on business and they\r\nbrought a supply of much needed ammunition, photographic plates, traps\r\nand my Mannlicher rifle. This equipment had been shipped from New York\r\nten months earlier but had only just reached Peking and been released\r\nfrom the Customs through the heroic efforts of Mr. Guptil.\r\n\r\nWe had another two weeks' hunting trip before we said good-by to\r\nMongolia but it netted few results. All the valleys, which had been\r\ndeserted when we were there before, were filled with Mongols cutting\r\nhay for the winter feed of their sheep and goats. Of course, every camp\r\nwas guarded by a dog or two, and their continual barking had driven the\r\nmoose, elk, and bear far back into the deepest forests where we had no\r\ntime to follow.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. MacCallie had taken a house in Urga, just opposite\r\nthe Russian Consulate, and they entertained us while I packed our\r\ncollections which were stored in Andersen, Meyer's godown. It was\r\na full week's work, for we had more than a thousand specimens. The\r\nforests of Mongolia had yielded up their treasures as we had not dared\r\nto hope they would, and we left them with almost as much regret as we\r\nhad left the plains.\r\n\r\nOctober first the specimens started southward on camel back. Kublai\r\nKhan, my pony, went with them, while we left in the Chinese Government\r\nmotor cars. For two hundred miles we rushed over the same plains which,\r\na few months earlier, we had laboriously crossed with our caravan.\r\nEvery spot was pregnant with delightful memories. At this well we had\r\ncamped for a week and hunted antelope; in that ragged mass of rocks we\r\nhad killed a wolf; out on the Turin plain we had trapped twenty-six\r\nmarmots in an enormous colony.\r\n\r\nThose had been glorious days and our hearts were sad as we raced back\r\nto Peking and civilization. But one bright spot remained--we need not\r\nyet leave our beloved East! Far to the south, in brigand-infested\r\nmountains on the edge of China, there dwelt a herd of bighorn sheep,\r\nthe _argali_ of the Mongols. Among them was a great ram, and we had\r\nlearned his hiding place. How we got him is another story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE PASSING OF MONGOLIAN MYSTERY\r\n\r\n\r\nI know of no other country about which there is so much\r\n_misinformation_ as about Mongolia. Because the Gobi Desert stretches\r\nthrough its center the popular conception appears to be that it is\r\na waste of sand and gravel incapable of producing anything. In the\r\npreceding chapters I have attempted to give a picture of the country\r\nas we found it and, although our interests were purely zoölogical,\r\nI should like to present a few notes regarding its commercial\r\npossibilities, for I have never seen a land which is readily accessible\r\nand is yet so undeveloped.\r\n\r\nEvery year the Far East is becoming increasingly important to the\r\nWestern World, and especially to the people of the United States, for\r\nChina and its dependencies is the logical place for the investment of\r\nAmerican capital. It is the last great undeveloped field, and I am\r\ninterested in seeing the American business man appreciate the great\r\nopportunities which await him in the Orient.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Gobi Desert is a part of Mongolia, but only in\r\nits western half is it a desolate waste; in the eastern section it\r\ngradually changes into a rolling plain covered with \"Gobi sage brush\"\r\nand short bunch grass. When one looks closely one sees that the\r\nunderlying soil is very fine gravel and sand.\r\n\r\nThere is little water in this region except surface ponds, which are\r\nusually dry in summer, and caravans depend upon wells. The water in the\r\ndesert area contains some alkali but, except in a few instances, the\r\nimpregnation is so slight that it is not especially disagreeable to the\r\ntaste. Mr. Larsen told me that there is no part of the country between\r\nKalgan and Urga in which water cannot be found within ten or twenty\r\nfeet of the surface. I am not prepared to say what this arid region\r\ncould be made to produce. Doubtless, from the standpoint of agriculture\r\nit would be of little importance but sheep and goats could live upon\r\nits summer vegetation, I am sure.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say where the Gobi really begins or ends when\r\ncrossing it between Kalgan and Urga, for the grasslands both on the\r\nsouth and north merge so imperceptibly into the arid central part\r\nthat there is no real \"edge\" to the desert; however, it is safe to\r\ntake Panj-kiang as the southern margin, and Turin as the northern\r\nlimit, of the Gobi. Both in the north and south the land is rich and\r\nfertile--much like the plains of Siberia or the prairies of Kansas and\r\nNebraska.\r\n\r\nSuch is the eastern Gobi from June to mid-September. In the winter,\r\nwhen the dried vegetation exposes the surface soil, the whole aspect of\r\nthe country is changed and then it does resemble the popular conception\r\nof a desert. But what could be more desertlike than our north China\r\nlandscape when frost has stripped away the green clothing of its hills\r\nand fields?\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have already demonstrated the agricultural possibilities in\r\nthe south and every year they reap a splendid harvest of oats, wheat,\r\nmillet, buckwheat and potatoes. On the grass-covered meadowlands, both\r\nnorth and south of the Gobi, there are vast herds of sheep, goats,\r\ncattle and horses, but they are only a fraction of the numbers which\r\nthe pasturage could support. The cattle and sheep which are exported\r\nthrough China can be sent to Kalgan \"on the hoof,\" for since grass is\r\nplentiful, the animals can graze at night and travel during the day.\r\nThis very materially reduces the cost of transportation.\r\n\r\nBesides the great quantities of beef and mutton which could be raised\r\nand marketed in the Orient, America or Europe, thousands of pounds of\r\nwool and camel hair could be exported. Of course both of these articles\r\nare produced at the present time, but only in limited quantities. In\r\nthe region where we spent the summer, the Mongols sometimes do not\r\nshear their sheep or camels but gather the wool from the ground when it\r\nhas dropped off in the natural process of shedding. Probably half of\r\nit is lost, and the remainder is full of dirt and grass which detracts\r\ngreatly from its value. Moreover, when it is shipped the impurities\r\nadd at least twenty per cent to its weight, and the high cost of\r\ntransportation makes this an important factor. Indeed, under proper\r\ndevelopment the pastoral resources of Mongolia are almost unlimited.\r\n\r\nThe Turin-Urga region has another commercial asset in the enormous\r\ncolonies of marmots which inhabit the country for hundreds of miles to\r\nthe north, east and west. The marmots are prolific breeders--each pair\r\nannually producing six or eight young--and, although their fur is not\r\nespecially fine, it has always been valuable for coats. Several million\r\nmarmot pelts are shipped every year from Mongolia, the finest coming\r\nfrom Uliassutai in the west, and were American steel traps introduced\r\nthe number could be doubled.\r\n\r\nUrga is just being discovered as a fur market. Many skins which have\r\nbeen taken well across the Russian frontier are sold in Urga, and\r\nas the trade increases it will command a still wider area. Wolves,\r\nfoxes, lynx, bear, wildcats, sables, martens, squirrels and marmots\r\nare brought in by thousands; and great quantities of sheep, goat, cow\r\nand antelope hides are sent annually to Kalgan. Several foreign fur\r\nhouses of considerable importance already have their representatives in\r\nUrga and more are coming every year. The possibilities for development\r\nin this direction are almost boundless, and I believe that within a\r\nvery few years Urga will become one of the greatest fur markets of the\r\nOrient.\r\n\r\nAs in the south the Chinese farmer cultivates the grasslands of the\r\nMongols, so in the north the Chinese merchant has assumed the trade.\r\nMany firms in Peking and Tientsin have branches in Urga and make\r\nhuge profits in the sale of food, cloth and other essentials to the\r\nMongols and foreigners and in the export of furs, skins and wool. It\r\nis well-nigh impossible to touch business in Mongolia at any point\r\nwithout coming in contact with the Chinese.\r\n\r\nAll work not connected with animals is assumed by Chinese, for the\r\nMongols are almost useless for anything which cannot be done from\r\nthe back of a horse. Thus the Chinese have a practical monopoly and\r\nthey exercise all their prerogatives in the enormous prices which\r\nthey charge for the slightest service. Mongols and foreigners suffer\r\ntogether in this respect, but there is no alternative--the Chinaman can\r\ncharge what he pleases, for he knows full well that no one else will do\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is considerable mineral wealth in northern Mongolia, up\r\nto the present time very little prospecting has been done. For several\r\nyears a Russian company has carried on successful operations for gold\r\nat the Yero mines, between Urga and Kiakhta on the Siberian frontier,\r\nbut they have had to import practically all their labor from China. We\r\noften passed Chinese in the Gobi Desert walking across Mongolia pushing\r\na wheelbarrow which contained all their earthly belongings. They were\r\non their way to the Yero mines for the summer's work; in the fall they\r\nwould return on foot the way they had come. Now that Mongolia is once\r\nmore a part of the Chinese Republic, the labor problem probably will\r\nbe improved for there will certainly be an influx of Chinese who are\r\nanxious to work.\r\n\r\nTransportation is the greatest of all commercial factors in the\r\nOrient and upon it largely depends the development of any country. In\r\nMongolia the problem can be easily solved. At the present time it\r\nrests upon camel caravans, ox and pony carts and upon automobiles for\r\npassengers. Camel traffic begins in September and is virtually ended\r\nby the first of June. Then their places on the trail are taken by ox-\r\nand pony-carts. Camels make the journey from Kalgan to Urga in from\r\nthirty to fifty days, but the carts require twice as long. They travel\r\nslowly, at best, and the animals must be given time to graze and rest.\r\nOf course, they cannot cross the desert when the grass is dry, so that\r\ntransportation is divided by the season--camels in winter and carts in\r\nsummer. Each camel carries from four hundred and fifty to five hundred\r\npounds, and the charges for the journey from Kalgan to Urga vary with\r\nconditions at from five to fifteen cents (silver) per _cattie_ (one and\r\none-third pounds). Thus, by the time goods have reached Urga, their\r\nvalue has increased tremendously.\r\n\r\nI can see no reason why motor trucks could not make the trip and am\r\nintending to use them on my next expedition. Between Panj-kiang and\r\nTurin, the first and third telegraph stations, there is some bad going\r\nin spots, but a well made truck with a broad wheel base and a powerful\r\nengine certainly could negotiate the sand areas without difficulty.\r\nAfter Turin, where the Gobi may be said to end, the road is like a\r\nboulevard.\r\n\r\nThe motor service for passengers which the Chinese Government maintains\r\nbetween Kalgan and Urga is a branch of the Peking-Suiyuan Railway and\r\nhas proved successful after some initial difficulties due to careless\r\nand inexperienced chauffeurs. Although the service badly needs\r\norganization to make it entirely safe and comfortable, still it has\r\nbeen effective even in its crude form.\r\n\r\nAt the present time a great part of the business which is done with\r\nthe Mongols is by barter. The Chinese merchants extend credit to the\r\nnatives for material which they require and accept in return cattle,\r\nhorses, hides, wool, etc., to be paid at the proper season. In recent\r\nyears Russian paper _rubles_ and Chinese silver have been the currency\r\nof the country, but since the war Russian money has so depreciated\r\nthat it is now practically valueless. Mongolia greatly needs banking\r\nfacilities and under the new political conditions undoubtedly these\r\nwill be materially increased.\r\n\r\nA great source of wealth to Mongolia lies in her magnificent forests of\r\npine, spruce, larch and birch which stretch away in an almost unbroken\r\nline of green to far beyond the Siberian frontier. As yet but small\r\ninroads have been made upon these forests, and as I stood one afternoon\r\nupon the summit of a mountain gazing over the miles of timbered hills\r\nbelow me, it seemed as though here at least was an inexhaustible supply\r\nof splendid lumber. But no more pernicious term was ever coined than\r\n\"inexhaustible supply!\" I wondered, as I watched the sun drop into\r\nthe somber masses of the forest, how long these splendid hills would\r\nremain inviolate. Certainly not many years after the Gobi Desert has\r\nbeen crossed by lines of steel, and railroad sheds have replaced the\r\ngold-roofed temples of sacred Urga.\r\n\r\nWe are at the very beginning of the days of flying, and no land which\r\ncontains such magnificent spruce can keep its treasure boxes unspoiled\r\nfor very long. Even as I write, aëroplanes are waiting in Peking to\r\nmake their first flight across Mongolia. The desert nomads have not yet\r\nceased to wonder at the motor cars which cover as many miles of plain\r\nin one day as their camels cross in ten. But what _will_ they think\r\nwhen twenty men leave Kalgan at noon and dine in Urga at seven o'clock\r\nthat night! Seven hundred miles mean very little to us now! The start\r\nhas been made already and, after all, it is largely that which counts.\r\nThe automobile has come to stay, we know; and motor trucks will soon\r\ndo for freight what has already been done for passengers, not only\r\nfrom Kalgan to Urga, but west to Uliassutai, and on to Kobdo at the\r\nvery edge of the Altai Mountains. Few spots in Mongolia need remain\r\nuntouched, if commercial calls are strong enough.\r\n\r\nLast year the first caravans left Feng-chen with wireless equipment for\r\nthe eighteen hundred mile journey across Mongolia to Urumchi in the\r\nvery heart of central Asia. Construction at Urga is well advanced and\r\nit will soon begin at Kashgar. When these stations are completed Kobdo\r\nin Mongolia, Hami in Chinese Turkestan, and Sian-fu in Shensi will\r\nsee wireless shafts erected; and old Peking will be in touch with the\r\nremotest spots of her far-flung lands at any time by day or night.\r\n\r\nThese things are not idle dreams--they are hard business facts already\r\nin the first stages of accomplishment. Why, then, should the railroad\r\nbe long delayed? It may be built from Kalgan to Urga, or by way\r\nof Kwei-hua-cheng--either route is feasible. It will mean a direct\r\nconnection between Shanghai, China's greatest port, and Verkhin Udinsk\r\non the Trans-Siberian Railroad via Tientsin, Peking, Kalgan, Urga,\r\nKiakhta. It will shorten the trip to London by at least four days for\r\npassengers and freight. It will open for settlement and commercial\r\ndevelopment a country of boundless possibilities and unknown wealth\r\nwhich for centuries has been all but forgotten.\r\n\r\nLess than seven hundred years ago Mongolia well-nigh ruled the world.\r\nHer people were strong beyond belief, but her empire crumbled as\r\nquickly as it rose, leaving to posterity only a glorious tradition\r\nand a land of mystery. The tradition will endure for centuries; but\r\nthe motor car and aëroplane and wireless have dispelled the mystery\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT RAM OF THE SHANSI MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nAway up in northern China, just south of the Mongolian frontier, is a\r\nrange of mountains inhabited by bands of wild sheep. They are wonderful\r\nanimals, these sheep, with horns like battering-rams. But the mountains\r\nare also populated by brigands and the two do not form an agreeable\r\ncombination from the sportsman's standpoint.\r\n\r\nIn reality they are perfectly nice, well-behaved brigands, but\r\noccasionally they forget their manners and swoop down upon the\r\ncaravan road less than a dozen miles away. This is done only when\r\nscouts bring word that cargo valuable enough to make it worth while\r\nis about to pass. Each time the brigands make a foray a return raid\r\nby Chinese soldiers can be expected. Occasionally these are real,\r\n\"honest-to-goodness\" fights, and blood may flow on both sides, but the\r\nbattle sometimes takes a different form.\r\n\r\nWith bugles blowing, the soldiers march out to the hills. Through\r\n\"middle men\" the battle ground has been agreed upon, and a \"David\" is\r\nchosen from the soldiers to meet the \"Goliath\" of the brigands. But\r\nDavid is particularly careful to leave his gun behind, and to have his\r\n\"sling\" well stuffed with rifle shells. Goliath advances to the combat\r\narmed only with a bag of silver dollars. Then an even trade ensues--a\r\ndollar for a cartridge--and the implement of war changes hands.\r\n\r\nPLATE XIII\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAVE DWELLINGS IN NORTH SHANSI PROVINCE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ASIATIC WAPITI]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARRY R. CALDWELL AND A MONGOLIAN BIGHORN]\r\n\r\nThe soldiers return to the city with bugles sounding as merrily as\r\nwhen they left. The commander sends a report to Peking of a desperate\r\nbattle with the brigands. He says that, through the extreme valor of\r\nhis soldiers, the bandits have been dispersed and many killed; that\r\nhundreds of cartridges were expended in the fight; therefore, kindly\r\nsend more as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAll this because the government has an unfortunate way of forgetting\r\nto pay its soldiers in the outlying provinces. When no money is\r\nforthcoming and none is visible on the horizon, it is not surprising\r\nthat they take other means to obtain it. \"Battles\" of this type are by\r\nno means exceptions--they are more nearly the rule in many provinces of\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nBut what has all this to do with the wild sheep? Its relation is very\r\nintimate, for the presence of brigands in those Shansi mountains has\r\nmade it possible for the animals to exist. The hunting grounds are\r\nonly five days' travel from Peking and many foreigners have turned\r\nlonging eyes toward the mountains. But the brigands always had to be\r\nconsidered. Since Sir Richard Dane, formerly Chief Inspector of the\r\nSalt Gabelle, and Mr. Charles Coltman were driven out by the bandits\r\nin 1915, the Chinese Government has refused to grant passports to\r\nforeigners who wished to shoot in that region. The brigands themselves\r\ncannot waste cartridges at one dollar each on the sheep, so the\r\nanimals have been allowed to breed unmolested.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are not many sheep there. They are the last\r\nsurvivors of great herds which once roamed the mountains of north\r\nChina. The technical name of the species is _Ovis commosa_ (formerly\r\n_O. jubata_) and it is one of the group of bighorns known to sportsmen\r\nby the Mongol name of _argali_. In size, as well as ancestry, the\r\nmembers of this group are the grandfathers of all the sheep. The\r\nlargest ram of our Rocky Mountains is a pygmy compared with a\r\nfull-grown _argali_. Hundreds of thousands of years ago the bighorns,\r\nwhich originated in Asia, crossed into Alaska by way of the Bering Sea,\r\nwhere there was probably a land connection at that time. From Alaska\r\nthey gradually worked southward, along the mountains of the western\r\ncoast, into Mexico and Lower California. In the course of time, changed\r\nenvironment developed different species; but the migration route from\r\nthe Old World to the New is there for all to read.\r\n\r\nThe supreme trophy of a sportsman's life is the head of a Mongolian\r\nbighorn sheep. I think it was Rex Beach who said, \"Some men can shoot\r\nbut not climb. Some can climb but not shoot. To get a sheep you must be\r\nable to climb and shoot, too.\"\r\n\r\nFor its Hall of Asiatic Life, the American Museum of Natural History\r\nneeded a group of _argali_. Moreover, we wanted a ram which would\r\nfairly represent the species, and that meant a very big one. The\r\nReverend Harry R. Caldwell, with whom I had hunted tiger in south\r\nChina, volunteered to get them with me. The brigands did not worry\r\nus unduly, for we both have had considerable experience with Chinese\r\nbandits and we feel that they are like animals--if you don't tease\r\nthem, they won't bite. In this case the \"teasing\" takes the form of\r\ncarrying anything that they could readily dispose of--especially money.\r\nI decided that my wife must remain in Peking. She was in open rebellion\r\nbut there was just a possibility that the brigands might annoy us, and\r\nwe had determined to have those sheep regardless of consequences.\r\n\r\nAlthough we did not expect trouble, I knew that Harry Caldwell could\r\nbe relied upon in any emergency. When a man will crawl into a tiger's\r\nlair, a tangle of sword grass and thorns, just to find out what the\r\nbrute has had for dinner; when he will walk into the open in dim light\r\nand shoot, with a .22 high-power rifle, a tiger which is just ready to\r\ncharge; when he will go alone and unarmed into the mountains to meet a\r\nband of brigands who have been terrorizing the country, it means that\r\nhe has more nerve than any one man needs in this life!\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the train at Feng-chen, the journey was like all others\r\nin north China; slow progress with a cart over atrocious roads which\r\nare either a mass of sticky mud or inches deep in fine brown dust.\r\nWe had four days of it before we reached the mountains but the trip\r\nwas full of interest to us both, for along the road there was an\r\never-changing picture of provincial life. To Harry it was especially\r\nilluminating because he had spent nineteen years in south China and had\r\nnever before visited the north. He began to realize what every one\r\nsoon learns who wanders much about the Middle Kingdom--that it is never\r\nsafe to generalize in this strange land. Conditions true of one region\r\nmay be absolutely unknown a few hundred miles away. He was continually\r\nirritated to find that his perfect knowledge of the dialect of Fukien\r\nProvince was utterly useless. He was well-nigh as helpless as though he\r\nhad never been in China, for the languages of the north and the south\r\nare almost as unlike as are French and German. Even our \"boys\" who\r\nwere from Peking had some difficulty in making themselves understood,\r\nalthough we were not more than two hundred miles from the capital.\r\n\r\nInstead of hills thickly clothed with sword grass, here the slopes\r\nwere bare and brown. We were too far north for rice; corn, wheat, and\r\n_kaoliang_ took the place of paddy fields. Instead of brick-walled\r\nhouses we found dwellings made of clay like the \"adobe\" of Mexico and\r\nArizona. Sometimes whole villages were dug into the hillside and the\r\nnatives were cave dwellers, spending their lives within the earth.\r\n\r\nAll north China is spread with loess. During the Glacial Period, about\r\none hundred thousand years ago, when in Europe and America great rivers\r\nof ice were descending from the north, central and eastern Asia seems\r\nto have suffered a progressive dehydration. There was little moisture\r\nin the air so that ice could not be formed. Instead, the climate was\r\ncold and dry, while violent winds carried the dust in whirling clouds\r\nfor hundreds upon hundreds of miles, spreading it in ever thickening\r\nlayers over the hills and plains. Therefore, the \"Ice Age\" for Europe\r\nand America was a \"Dust Age\" for northeastern Asia.\r\n\r\nThe inns were a constant source of interest to us both. Their spacious\r\ncourtyards contrasted strangely with the filthy \"hotels\" of southern\r\nChina. In the north all the traffic is by cart, and there must be\r\naccommodation for hundreds of vehicles; in the south where goods are\r\ncarried by boats, coolies, or on donkey back, extensive compounds are\r\nunnecessary. Each night, wherever we arrived, we found the courtyard\r\nteeming with life and motion. Line after line of laden carts wound\r\nin through the wide swinging gates and lined up in orderly array;\r\nthere was the steady \"crunch, crunch, crunch\" of feeding animals,\r\nshouts for the _jonggweda_ (landlord), and good-natured chaffing\r\namong the carters. In the great kitchen, which is also the sleeping\r\nroom, over blazing fires fanned by bellows, pots of soup and macaroni\r\nwere steaming. On the two great _kangs_ (bed platforms), heated from\r\nbelow by long flues radiating outward from the cooking fires, dozens\r\nof _mafus_ were noisily sucking in their food or already snoring\r\ncontentedly, rolled in their dusty coats.\r\n\r\nMany kinds of folk were there; rich merchants enveloped in splendid\r\nsable coats and traveling in padded carts; peddlers with packs of\r\ntrinkets for the women; wandering doctors selling remedies of herbs,\r\ntonics made from deerhorns or tigers' teeth, and wonderful potions\r\nof \"dragons' bones.\" Perhaps there was a Buddhist priest or two, a\r\nbarber, or a tailor. Often a professional entertainer sat cross-legged\r\non the hang telling endless stories or singing for hours at a time in a\r\nhigh-pitched, nasal voice, accompanying himself upon a tiny snake-skin\r\nviolin. It was like a stage drama of concentrated Chinese country life.\r\n\r\nAmong this polyglot assembly perhaps there may be a single man who has\r\narrived with a pack upon his back. He is indistinguishable from the\r\nother travelers and mingles among the _mafus_, helping now and then to\r\nfeed a horse or adjust a load. But his ears and eyes are open. He is\r\na brigand scout who is there to learn what is passing on the road. He\r\nhears all the gossip from neighboring towns as well as of those many\r\nmiles away, for the inns are the newspapers of rural China, and it is\r\nevery one's business to tell all he knows. The scout marks a caravan,\r\nthen slips away into the mountains to report to the leader of his band.\r\nThe attack may not take place for many days. While the unsuspecting\r\n_mafus_ are plodding on their way, the bandits are hovering on the\r\noutskirts among the hills until the time is ripe to strike.\r\n\r\nI have learned that these brigand scouts are my best protection,\r\nfor when a foreigner arrives at a country inn all other subjects of\r\nconversation lose their interest. Everything about him is discussed and\r\nrediscussed, and the scouts discover all there is to know. Probably\r\nthe only things I ever carry which a bandit could use or dispose of\r\nreadily, are arms and ammunition. But two or three guns are hardly\r\nworth the trouble which would follow the death of a foreigner. The\r\nbrigands know that there would be no sham battle with Chinese soldiers\r\nin that event, for the Legations at Peking have a habit of demanding\r\nreparation from the Government and insisting that they get it.\r\n\r\nAs a _raison d'être_ for our trip Caldwell and I had been hunting\r\nducks, geese, and pheasants industriously along the way, and not even\r\nthe \"boys\" knew our real destination.\r\n\r\nWe had looked forward with great eagerness to the Tai Hai, a large\r\nlake, where it was said that water fowl congregated in thousands during\r\nthe spring and fall. We reached the lake the second night after leaving\r\nFeng-chen. Darkness had just closed about us when we crossed the summit\r\nof a high mountain range and descended into a narrow, winding cut which\r\neventually led us out upon the flat plains of the Tai Hai basin. While\r\nwe were in the pass a dozen flocks of geese slipped by above our heads,\r\nflying very low, the \"wedges\" showing black against the starlit sky.\r\n\r\nWith much difficulty we found an inn close beside the lake and, after a\r\nlate supper, snuggled into our fur bags to be lulled to sleep by that\r\nmusic most dear to a sportsman's heart, the subdued clamor of thousands\r\nof water-fowl settling themselves for the night.\r\n\r\nAt daylight we dressed hurriedly and ran to the lake shore. Harry took\r\na station away from the water at the base of the hills, while I dropped\r\nbehind three conical mounds which the natives had constructed to obtain\r\nsalt by evaporation.\r\n\r\nI was hardly in position before two geese came straight for me. Waiting\r\nuntil they were almost above my head, I knocked down both with a right\r\nand left. The shots put thousands of birds in motion. Flock after flock\r\nof geese rose into the air, and long lines of ducks skimmed close to\r\nthe surface, settling away from shore or on the mud flats near the\r\nwater's edge.\r\n\r\nNo more birds came near me, and in fifteen minutes I returned to the\r\ninn for breakfast. Harry appeared shortly after with only a mallard\r\nduck, for he had guessed wrong as to the direction of the flight, and\r\nwas entirely out of the shooting.\r\n\r\nWhen the carts had started at eight o'clock Harry and I rode down the\r\nshore of the lake to the south, with Chen to hold our horses. The mud\r\nflats were dotted with hundreds of ruddy sheldrakes, their beautiful\r\nbodies glowing red and gold in the sunlight. A hundred yards from shore\r\nhalf a dozen swans drifted about like floating snow banks, and ducks\r\nand geese by thousands rose or settled in the lake. We saw a flock of\r\nmallards alight in the short marsh grass and when I fired at least five\r\nhundred greenheads, yellow-nibs, and pintails rose in a brown cloud.\r\n\r\nCrouched behind the salt mounds, we had splendid shooting and then rode\r\non to join the carts, our ponies loaded with ducks and geese. The road\r\nswung about to the north, and we saw geese in tens of thousands coming\r\ninto the lake across the mountain passes from their summer breeding\r\ngrounds in Mongolia and far Siberia. Regiment after regiment swept\r\npast, circled away to the west, and dropped into the water as though\r\nat the command of a field marshal.\r\n\r\nAlthough we were following the main road to Kwei-hua-cheng, a city of\r\nconsiderable importance not far from the mountains which contained the\r\nsheep, we had no intention of going there. Neither did we wish to pass\r\nthrough any place where there might be soldiers, so on the last day's\r\nmarch we left the highway and followed an unimportant trail to the tiny\r\nvillage of Wu-shi-tu, which nestles against the mountain's base. Here\r\nwe made our camp in a Chinese house and obtained two Mongol hunters. We\r\nhad hoped to live in tents, but there was not a stick of wood for fuel.\r\nThe natives burn either coal or grass and twigs, but these would not\r\nkeep us warm in an open camp.\r\n\r\nAbout the village rose a chaotic mass of saw-toothed mountains cut,\r\nto the east, by a stupendous gorge. We stood silent with awe, when we\r\nfirst climbed a winding, white trail to the summit of the mountain and\r\ngazed into the abysmal depths. My eye followed an eagle which floated\r\nacross the chasm to its perch on a projecting crag; thence down the\r\nsheer face of the cliff a thousand feet to the stream which has carved\r\nthis colossal cañon from the living rock. Like a shining silver tracing\r\nit twisted and turned, foaming over rocks and running in smooth, green\r\nsheets between vertical walls of granite. To the north we looked across\r\nat a splendid panorama of saw-toothed peaks and ragged pinnacles tinted\r\nwith delicate shades of pink and lavender. Beneath our feet were slabs\r\nof pure white marble and great blocks of greenish feldspar. Among the\r\npeaces were deep ravines and, farther to the east, rolling uplands\r\ncarpeted with grass. There the sheep are found.\r\n\r\nWe killed only one goral and a roebuck during the first two days, for\r\na violent gale made hunting well-nigh impossible. On the third morning\r\nthe sun rose in a sky as blue as the waters of a tropic sea, and not a\r\nbreath of air stirred the silver poplar leaves as we crossed the rocky\r\nstream bed to the base of the mountains north of camp. Fifteen hundred\r\nfeet above us towered a ragged granite ridge which must be crossed ere\r\nwe could gain entrance to the grassy valleys beyond the barrier.\r\n\r\nWe had toiled halfway up the slope, when my hunter sank into the\r\ngrass, pointed upward, and whispered, \"_Pan-yang_\" (wild sheep).\r\nThere, on the very summit of the highest pinnacle, stood a magnificent\r\nram silhouetted against the sky. It was a stage introduction to the\r\ngreatest game animal in all the world.\r\n\r\nMotionless, as though sculptured from the living granite, it gazed\r\nacross the valley toward the village whence we had come. Through my\r\nglasses I could see every detail of its splendid body--the wash of gray\r\nwith which many winters had tinged its neck and flanks, the finely\r\ndrawn legs, and the massive horns curling about a head as proudly\r\nheld as that of a Roman warrior. He stood like a statue for half an\r\nhour, while we crouched motionless in the trail below; then he turned\r\ndeliberately and disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the summit of the ridge the ram was nowhere to be seen,\r\nbut we found his tracks on a path leading down a knifelike outcrop to\r\nthe bottom of another valley. I felt sure that he would turn eastward\r\ntoward the grassy uplands, but Na-mon-gin, my Mongol hunter, pointed\r\nnorth to a sea of ragged mountains. We groaned as we looked at those\r\ntowering peaks; moreover, it seemed hopeless to hunt for a single\r\nanimal in that chaos of ravines and cañons.\r\n\r\nWe had already learned, however, that the Mongol knew almost as much\r\nabout what a sheep would do as did the animal itself. It was positively\r\nuncanny. Perhaps we would see a herd of sheep half a mile away. The\r\nold fellow would seat himself, nonchalantly fill his pipe and puff\r\ncontentedly, now and then glancing at the animals. In a few moments he\r\nwould announce what was about to happen, and he was seldom wrong.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when he descended to the bottom of the valley we accepted\r\nhis dictum without a protest. At the creek bed Harry and his young\r\nhunter left us to follow a deep ravine which led upward a little to\r\nthe left, while Na-mon-gin and I climbed to the crest by way of a\r\nprecipitous ridge.\r\n\r\nNot fifteen minutes after we parted, Harry's rifle banged three\r\ntimes in quick succession, the reports rolling out from the gorge in\r\nmajestic waves of sound. A moment later the old Mongol saw three sheep\r\nsilhouetted for an instant against the sky as they scrambled across the\r\nridge. Then a voice floated faintly up to me from out the cañon.\r\n\r\n\"I've got a f-i-n-e r-a-m,\" it said, \"a b-e-a-u-t-y,\" and even at that\r\ndistance I could hear its happy ring.\r\n\r\n\"Good for Harry,\" I thought. \"He certainly deserved it after his work\r\nof last night;\" for on the way home his hunter had seen an enormous ram\r\nclimbing a mountain side and they had followed it to the summit only to\r\nlose its trail in the gathering darkness. Harry had stumbled into camp,\r\nhalf dead with fatigue, but with his enthusiasm undiminished.\r\n\r\nWhen Na-mon-gin and I had reached the highest peak and found a trail\r\nwhich led along the mountain side just below the crest, we kept\r\nsteadily on, now and then stopping to scan the grassy ravines and\r\nvalleys which radiated from the ridge like the ribs of a giant fan.\r\nAt half past eleven, as we rounded a rocky shoulder, I saw four sheep\r\nfeeding in the bottom of a gorge far below us.\r\n\r\nQuite unconscious of our presence, they worked out of the ravine across\r\na low spur and into a deep gorge where the grass still showed a tinge\r\nof green. As the last one disappeared, we dashed down the slope and\r\ncame up just above the sheep. With my glasses I could see that the\r\nleader carried a fair pair of horns, but that the other three rams were\r\nsmall, as _argali_ go.\r\n\r\nLying flat, I pushed my rifle over the crest and aimed at the biggest\r\nram. Three or four tiny grass stems were directly in my line of sight,\r\nand fearing that they might deflect my bullet, I drew back and shifted\r\nmy position a few feet to the right.\r\n\r\nOne of the sheep must have seen the movement, although we were\r\ndirectly above them, and instantly all were off. In four jumps they\r\nhad disappeared around a bowlder, giving me time for only a hurried\r\nshot at the last one's white rump-patch. The bullet struck a few inches\r\nbehind the ram, and the valley was empty.\r\n\r\nLooking down where they had been so quietly feeding only a few moments\r\nbefore, I called myself all known varieties of a fool. I felt very bad\r\nindeed that I had bungled hopelessly my first chance at an _argali_.\r\nBut the sympathetic old hunter patted me on the shoulder and said in\r\nChinese, \"Never mind. They were small ones anyway--not worth having.\"\r\nThey were very much worth having to me, however, and all the light\r\nseemed to have gone out of the world. We smoked a cigarette, but there\r\nwas no consolation in that, and I followed the hunter around the peak\r\nwith a heart as heavy as lead.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later we sat down for a look around. I studied every ridge\r\nand gully with my glasses without seeing a sign of life. The four sheep\r\nhad disappeared as completely as though one of the yawning ravines\r\nhad swallowed them up; the great valley bathed in golden sunlight was\r\ndeserted and as silent as the tomb.\r\n\r\nI was just tearing the wrapper from a piece of chocolate when the\r\nhunter touched me on the arm and said quietly, \"_Pan-yang li la_\" (A\r\nsheep has come). He pointed far down a ridge running out at a right\r\nangle to the one on which we were sitting, but I could see nothing.\r\nThen I scanned every square inch of rock, but still saw no sign of life.\r\n\r\nThe hunter laughingly whispered, \"I can see better than you can even\r\nwith your foreign eyes. He is standing in that trail--he may come right\r\nup to us.\"\r\n\r\nI tried again, following the thin, white line as it wound from us along\r\nthe side of the knifelike ridge. Just where it vanished into space I\r\nsaw the sheep, a splendid ram, standing like a statue of gray-brown\r\ngranite and gazing squarely at us. He was fully half a mile away, but\r\nthe hunter had seen him the instant he appeared. Without my glasses the\r\nanimal was merely a blur to me, but the marvelous eyes of the Mongol\r\ncould detect its every movement.\r\n\r\n\"It is the same one we saw this morning,\" he said. \"I was sure we would\r\nfind him over here. He has very big horns--much better than those\r\nothers.\"\r\n\r\nThat was quite true; but the others had given me a shot and this ram,\r\nsplendid as he was, seemed as unobtainable as the stars. For an hour we\r\nwatched him. Sometimes he would turn about to look across the ravines\r\non either side and once he came a dozen feet toward us along the path.\r\nThe hunter smoked quietly, now and then looking through my glasses.\r\n\"After a while he will go to sleep,\" he said, \"then we can shoot him.\"\r\n\r\nI must confess that I had but little hope. The ram seemed too splendid\r\nand much, much too far away. But I could feast my eyes on his\r\nmagnificent head and almost count the rings on his curling horns.\r\n\r\nA flock of red-legged partridges sailed across from the opposite ridge,\r\nuttering their rapid-fire call and alighted almost at our feet. Then\r\neach one seemed to melt into the mountain side, vanishing like magic\r\namong the grass and stones. I wondered mildly why they had concealed\r\nthemselves so suddenly, but a moment later there sounded a subdued\r\nwhir, like the motor of an aëroplane far up in the sky. Three shadows\r\ndrifted over, and I saw three huge black eagles swinging in ever\r\nlowering circles about our heads. I knew then that the partridges had\r\nsought the protection of our presence from their mortal enemies, the\r\neagles.\r\n\r\nWhen I looked at the sheep again he was lying down squarely in the\r\ntrail, lazily raising his head now and then to gaze about. The hunter\r\ninspected the ram through my glasses and prepared to go. We rolled\r\nslowly over the ridge and then hurried around to the projecting spur at\r\nthe end of which the ram was lying.\r\n\r\nThe going was very bad indeed. Pieces of crumbled granite were\r\ncontinually slipping under foot, and at times we had to cling like\r\nflies to a wall of rock with a sheer drop of hundreds of feet below us.\r\nTwice the Mongol cautiously looked over the ridge, but each time shook\r\nhis head and worked his way a little farther. At last he motioned me to\r\nslide up beside him. Pushing my rifle over the rock before me, I raised\r\nmyself a few inches and saw the massive head and neck of the ram two\r\nhundred yards away. His body was behind a rocky shoulder, but he was\r\nlooking squarely at us and in a second would be off.\r\n\r\nI aimed carefully just under his chin, and at the roar of the\r\nhigh-power shell, the ram leaped backward. \"You hit him,\" said the\r\nMongol, but I felt he must be wrong; if the bullet had found the neck\r\nhe would have dropped like lead.\r\n\r\nNever in all my years of hunting have I had a feeling of such intense\r\nsurprise and self-disgust. I had been certain of the shot and it was\r\nimpossible to believe that I had missed. A lump rose in my throat and\r\nI sat with my head resting on my hands in the uttermost depths of\r\ndejection.\r\n\r\nAnd then the impossible happened! Why it happened, I shall never know.\r\nA kind Providence must have directed the actions of the sheep, for, as\r\nI raised my eyes, I saw again that enormous head and neck appear from\r\nbehind a rock a hundred yards away; just that head with its circlet of\r\nmassive horns and the neck--nothing more. Almost in a daze I lifted my\r\nrifle, saw the little ivory bead of the front sight center on that gray\r\nneck, and touched the trigger. A thousand echoes crashed back upon us.\r\nThere was a clatter of stones, a confused vision of a ponderous bulk\r\nheaving up and back--and all was still. But it was enough for me; there\r\ncould be no mistake this time. The ram was mine.\r\n\r\nThe sudden transition from utter dejection to the greatest triumph of\r\na sportsman's life set me wild with joy, I yelled and pounded the old\r\nMongol on the back until he begged for mercy; then I whirled him about\r\nin a war dance on the summit of the ridge. I wanted to leap down the\r\nrocks where the sheep had disappeared but the hunter held my arm. For\r\nten minutes we sat there waiting to make sure that the ram would not\r\ndash away while we were out of sight in the ravine below. But I knew\r\nin my heart that it was all unnecessary. My bullet had gone where I\r\nwanted it to go and that was quite enough. No sheep that ever walked\r\ncould live with a Mannlicher ball squarely in its neck.\r\n\r\nWhen we finally descended, the animal lay halfway down the slope,\r\nfeebly kicking. What a huge brute he was, and what a glorious head! I\r\nhad never dreamed that an _argali_ could be so splendid. His horns were\r\nperfect, and my hands could not meet around them at the base.\r\n\r\nThen, of course, I wanted to know what had happened at my first shot.\r\nThe evidence was there upon his face. My bullet had gone an inch high,\r\nstruck him in the corner of the mouth, and emerged from his right\r\ncheek. It must have been a painful wound, and I shall never cease to\r\nwonder what strange impulse brought him back after he had been so badly\r\nstung. The second ball had been centered in the neck as though in the\r\nbull's-eye of a target.\r\n\r\nThe skin and head of the sheep made a pack weighing nearly one hundred\r\npounds, and the old Mongol groaned as he looked up at the mountain\r\nbarriers which separated us from camp. On the summit of the first\r\nridge we found the trail over which we had passed in the morning. Half\r\nan hour later the hunter jerked me violently behind a ledge of rock.\r\n\"_Pan-yang_\" he whispered, \"there, on the mountain side. Can't you see\r\nhim?\" I could not, and he tried to point to it with my rifle. Just at\r\nthat instant what I had supposed to be a brown rock came to life in a\r\nwhirl of dust and vanished into the ravine below.\r\n\r\nWe waited breathlessly for perhaps a minute--it seemed hours--then the\r\nhead and shoulders of a sheep appeared from behind a bowlder. I aimed\r\nlow and fired, and the animal crumpled in its tracks. A second later\r\ntwo rams and a ewe dashed from the same spot and stopped upon the\r\nhillside less than a hundred yards away. Instinctively I sighted on the\r\nlargest but dropped my rifle without touching the trigger. The sheep\r\nwas small, and even if we did need him for the group we could not carry\r\nhis head and skin to camp that night. The wolves would surely have\r\nfound his carcass before dawn, and it would have been a useless waste\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nThe one I had killed was a fine young ram. With the skin, head, and\r\nparts of the meat packed upon my shoulders we started homeward at six\r\no'clock. Our only exit lay down the river bed in the bottom of a great\r\ncañon, for in the darkness it would have been dangerous to follow the\r\ntrail along the cliffs. In half an hour it was black night in the\r\ngorge. The vertical walls of rock shut out even the starlight, and we\r\ncould not see more than a dozen feet ahead.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget that walk. After wading the stream twenty-eight\r\ntimes I lost count. I was too cold and tired and had fallen over too\r\nmany rocks to have it make the slightest difference how many more than\r\ntwenty-eight times we went into the icy water. The hundred-pound pack\r\nupon my back weighed more every hour, but the thought of those two\r\nsplendid rams was as good as bread and wine.\r\n\r\nHarry was considerably worried when we reached camp at eleven o'clock,\r\nfor in the village there had been much talk of bandits. Even before\r\ndinner we measured the rams and found that the horns of the one he had\r\nkilled exceeded the published records for the species by half an inch\r\nin circumference. The horns were forty-seven inches in length, but\r\nwere broken at the tips; the original length was fifty-one inches; the\r\ncircumference at the base was twenty inches. Moreover, mine was not far\r\nbehind in size.\r\n\r\nAs I snuggled into my fur sleeping bag that night, I realized that it\r\nhad been the most satisfactory hunting day of my life. The success of\r\nthe group was assured, with a record ram for the central figure. We had\r\nthree specimens already, and the others would not be hard to get.\r\n\r\nThe next morning four soldiers were waiting in the courtyard when we\r\nawoke. With many apologies they informed us that they had been sent by\r\nthe commander of the garrison at Kwei-hua-cheng to ask us to go back\r\nwith them. The mountains were very dangerous; brigands were swarming\r\nin the surrounding country; the commandant was greatly worried for our\r\nsafety. Therefore, would we be so kind as to break camp at once.\r\n\r\nWe told them politely, but firmly, that it was impossible for us to\r\ncomply with their request. We needed the sheep for a great museum in\r\nNew York, and we could not return without them. As they could see for\r\nthemselves our passports had been properly viséed by the Foreign Office\r\nin Peking, and we were prepared to stay.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers returned to Kwei-hua-cheng, and the following day we were\r\nhonored by a visit from the commandant himself. To him we repeated\r\nour determination to remain. He evidently realized that we could not\r\nbe dislodged and suggested a compromise arrangement. He would send\r\nsoldiers to guard our house and to accompany us while we were hunting.\r\nWe assented readily, because we knew Chinese soldiers. Of course, the\r\nsentinel at the door troubled us not at all, and the ones who were to\r\naccompany us were easily disposed of. For the first day's hunt with our\r\nguard we selected the roughest part of the mountain, and set such a\r\nterrific pace up the almost perpendicular slope that before long they\r\nwere left far behind. They never bothered us again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nMONGOLIAN _ARGALI_\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we had seen nearly a dozen sheep where we killed our first\r\nthree rams, the mountains were deserted when Harry returned the\r\nfollowing morning. He hunted faithfully, but did not see even a\r\nroebuck; the sheep all had left for other feeding grounds. I remained\r\nin camp to superintend the preparation of our specimens.\r\n\r\nThe next day we had a glorious hunt. By six o'clock we were climbing\r\nthe winding, white trail west of camp, and for half an hour we stood\r\ngazing into the gloomy depths of the stupendous gorge, as yet unlighted\r\nby the morning sun. Then we separated, each making toward the grassy\r\nuplands by different routes.\r\n\r\nNa-mon-gin led me along the summit of a broken ridge, but, evidently,\r\nhe did not expect to find sheep in the ravines, for he kept straight\r\non, mile after mile, with never a halt for rest. At last we reached a\r\npoint where the plateau rolled away in grassy waves of brown. We were\r\ncircling a rounded hill, just below the crest, when, not thirty yards\r\naway, three splendid roe deer jumped to their feet and stood as though\r\nfrozen, gazing at us; then, with a snort, they dashed down the slope\r\nand up the other side. They had not yet disappeared, when two other\r\nbucks crossed a ridge into the bottom of the draw. It was a sore trial\r\nto let them go, but the old hunter had his hand upon my arm and shook\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nPassing the summit of the hill, we sat down for a look around. Before\r\nus, nearly a mile away, three shallow, grass-filled valleys dropped\r\nsteeply from the rolling meadowland. Almost instantly through my\r\nbinoculars I caught the moving forms of three sheep in the bottom of\r\nthe central draw. \"_Pan-yang_,\" I said to the Mongol. \"Yes, yes, I see\r\nthem,\" he answered. \"One has very big horns.\" He was quite right; for\r\nthe largest ram carried a splendid head, and the other was by no means\r\nsmall. The third was a tiny ewe. The animals wandered about nibbling at\r\nthe grass, but did not move out of the valley bottom. After studying\r\nthem awhile the hunter remarked, \"Soon they will go to sleep. We'll\r\nwait till then. They would hear or smell us if we went over now.\"\r\n\r\nI ate one of the three pears I had brought for tiffin and smoked a\r\ncigarette. The hunter stretched himself out comfortably upon the grass\r\nand pulled away at his pipe. It was very pleasant there, for we were\r\nprotected from the wind, and the sun was delightfully warm. I watched\r\nthe sheep through the glasses and wondered if I should carry home the\r\nsplendid ram that night. Finally the little ewe lay down and the others\r\nfollowed her example.\r\n\r\nWe were just preparing to go when the hunter touched my arm.\r\n\"_Pan-yang_\" he whispered. \"There, coming over the hill. Don't move.\"\r\nSure enough, a sheep was trotting slowly down the hillside in our\r\ndirection. Why he did not see or smell us, I cannot imagine, for the\r\nwind was in his direction. But he came on, passed within one hundred\r\nfeet, and stopped on the summit of the opposite swell. What a shot!\r\nHe was so close that I could have counted the rings on his horns--and\r\nthey were good horns, too, just the size we wanted for the group. But\r\nthe hunter would not let me shoot. Hi? heart was set upon the big ram\r\npeacefully sleeping a mile away.\r\n\r\n\"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\" is a motto which I have\r\nfollowed with good success in hunting, and I was loath to let that\r\n_argali_ go even for the prospect of the big one across the valley.\r\nBut I had a profound respect for the opinion of my hunter. He usually\r\nguessed right, and I had found it safe to follow his advice.\r\n\r\nSo we watched the sheep walk slowly over the crest of the hill. The\r\nMongol did not tell me then, but he knew that the animal was on his way\r\nto join the others, and his silence cost us the big ram. You may wonder\r\nhow he knew it. I can only answer that what that Mongol did not know\r\nabout the ways of sheep was not worth learning. He seemed to think as\r\nthe sheep thought, but, withal, was a most intelligent and delightful\r\ncompanion. His ready sympathy, his keen humor, and his interest in\r\nhelping me get the finest specimens of the animals I wanted, endeared\r\nhim to me in a way which only a sportsman can understand. His Shansi\r\ndialect and my limited Mandarin made a curious combination of the\r\nChinese language, but we could always piece it out with signs, and we\r\nnever misunderstood each other on any important matter.\r\n\r\nWe had many friendly differences of opinion about the way in which to\r\nconduct a stalk, and his childlike glee when he was proved correct was\r\nmost refreshing. One morning I got the better of him, and for days he\r\ncould not forget it. We were sitting on a hillside, and with my glasses\r\nI picked up a herd of sheep far away on the uplands. \"Yes,\" he said,\r\n\"one is a very big ram.\" How he could tell at that distance was a\r\nmystery to me, but I did not question his statement for he had proved\r\ntoo often that his range of sight was almost beyond belief.\r\n\r\nWe started toward the sheep, and after half a mile I looked again. Then\r\nI thought I saw a grasscutter, and the animals seemed like donkeys. I\r\nsaid as much but the hunter laughed. \"Why, I saw the horns,\" he said.\r\n\"One is a big one, a _very_ big one.\" I stopped a second time and made\r\nout a native bending over, cutting grass. But I could not convince the\r\nMongol. He disdained my glasses and would not even put them to his\r\neyes. \"I don't have to--I _know_ they are sheep,\" he laughed. But I,\r\ntoo, was sure. \"Well, we'll see,\" he said. When we looked again, there\r\ncould be no mistake; the sheep were donkeys. It was a treat to watch\r\nthe Mongol's face, and I made much capital of his mistake, for he had\r\nso often teased me when I was wrong.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the sheep across the valley which we were stalking\r\non that sunlit Thursday noon. After the ram had disappeared we made\r\nour way slowly around the hilltop, whence he had come, to gain a\r\nconnecting meadow which would bring us to the ravine where the _argali_\r\nwere sleeping. On the way I was in a fever of indecision. Ought I to\r\nhave let that ram go? He was just what we wanted for the group, and\r\nsomething might happen to prevent a shot at the others. It was \"a bird\r\nin the hand\" again, and I had been false to the motto which had so\r\noften proved true.\r\n\r\nThen the \"something\" I had feared did happen. We saw a grasscutter\r\nwith two donkeys emerge from a ravine on the left and strike along\r\nthe grassy bridge five hundred yards beyond us. If he turned to the\r\nright across the upper edge of the meadows, we could whistle for our\r\nsheep. Even if he kept straight ahead, possibly they might scent him.\r\nThe Mongol's face was like a thundercloud. I believe he would have\r\nstrangled that grasscutter could he have had him in his hands. But\r\nthe Fates were kind, and the man with his donkeys kept to the left\r\nacross the uplands. Even then my Mongol would not hurry. His motto was\r\n\"Slowly, slowly,\" and we seemed barely to crawl up the slope of the\r\nshallow valley which I hoped still held the sheep.\r\n\r\nOn the summit of the draw the old hunter motioned me behind him and\r\ncautiously raised his head. Then a little farther. Another step and a\r\nlong look. He stood on tiptoe, and, settling back, quietly motioned me,\r\nto move up beside him.\r\n\r\nJust then a gust of wind swept across the hilltop and into the ravine.\r\nThere was a rush of feet, a clatter of sliding rock, and three\r\n_argali_ dashed into view on the opposite slope. They stopped two\r\nhundred yards away. My hunter was frantically whispering, \"One more.\r\nDon't shoot. Don't shoot.\" I was at a loss to understand, for I knew\r\nthere were only three sheep in the draw. The two rams both seemed\r\nenormous, and I let drive at the leader. He went down like lead--shot\r\nthrough the shoulders. The two others ran a few yards and stopped\r\nagain. When I fired, the sheep whirled about but did not fall. I threw\r\nin another shell and held the sight well down. The \"putt\" of a bullet\r\non flesh came distinctly to us, but the ram stood without a motion.\r\n\r\nThe third shot was too much, and he slumped forward, rolled over,\r\nand crashed to the bottom of the ravine. All the time Na-mon-gin was\r\nfrantically whispering, \"Not right. Not right. The big one. The big\r\none.\" As the second sheep went down I learned the reason. Out from the\r\nvalley directly below us rushed a huge ram, washed with white on the\r\nneck and shoulders and carrying a pair of enormous, curling horns. I\r\nwas too surprised to move. How could four sheep be there, when I knew\r\nthere were only three!\r\n\r\nUsually I am perfectly cool when shooting and have all my excitement\r\nwhen the work is done, but the unexpected advent of that ram turned on\r\nthe thrills a bit too soon. I forgot what I had whispered to myself\r\nat every shot, \"Aim low, aim low. You are shooting down hill.\" I held\r\nsquarely on his gray-white shoulder and pulled the trigger. The bullet\r\njust grazed his back. He ran a few steps and stopped. Again I fired\r\nhurriedly, and the ball missed him by the fraction of an inch. I saw\r\nit strike and came to my senses with a jerk; but it was too late, for\r\nthe rifle was empty. Before I could cram in another shell the sheep was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nNa-mon-gin was absolutely disgusted. Even though I had killed two fine\r\nrams, he wanted the big one. \"But,\" I said, \"where did the fourth sheep\r\ncome from? I saw only three.\" He looked at me in amazement. \"Didn't\r\nyou know that the ram which walked by us went over to the others?\" he\r\nanswered. \"Any one ought to have known that much.\"\r\n\r\nWell, I hadn't known. Otherwise, I should have held my fire. Right\r\nthere the Mongol read me a lecture on too much haste. He said I was\r\nlike every other foreigner--always joy out of the others; and to make\r\nmatters worse, the magnificent animal stationed himself on the very\r\nhillside where we had been sitting when we saw them first and, with the\r\nlittle ewe close beside him, watched us for half an hour.\r\n\r\nNa-mon-gin glared at him and shook his fist. \"We'll get you to-morrow,\r\nyou old rabbit,\" he said; and then to me, \"Don't you care. I won't eat\r\ntill we kill him.\"\r\n\r\nFor the next ten minutes the kindly old Mongol devoted himself to\r\nbringing a smile to my lips. He told me he knew just where that ram\r\nwould go; we couldn't have carried in his head anyway; that it would\r\nbe much better to save him for to-morrow; and that I had killed the\r\nother two so beautifully that he was proud of me.\r\n\r\nI continued to feel better when I saw the two dead _argali_. They were\r\nboth fine rams, in perfect condition, with beautiful horns. One of them\r\nwas the sheep which had walked so close to us; there was no doubt of\r\nthat, for I had been able to see the details of his \"face and figure.\"\r\nEvery _argali_ has its own special characters which are unmistakable.\r\nIn the carriage of his head, the curve of his horns, and in coloration,\r\nhe is as individual as a human being.\r\n\r\nWhile we were examining the sheep, Harry and his hunter appeared upon\r\nthe rim of the ravine. They brought with them, on a donkey, the skin\r\nand head of a fine two-year-old ram which he had killed an hour earlier\r\nfar beyond us on the uplands. It fitted exactly into our series, and\r\nwhen we had another big ram and two ewes, the group would be complete.\r\n\r\nPoor Harry was hobbling along just able to walk. He had strained a\r\ntendon in his right leg the previous morning, and had been enduring the\r\nmost excruciating pain all day. He wanted to stay and help us skin the\r\nsheep, but I would not let him. We were a long way from camp, and it\r\nwould require all his strength to get back at all.\r\n\r\nAt half-past four we finished with the sheep, and tied the skins and\r\nmuch of the meat on the two donkeys which Harry had commandeered. Our\r\nonly way home lay down the river bed, for in the darkness we could not\r\nfollow the trail along the cliffs. By six o'clock it was black night in\r\nthe gorge.\r\n\r\nThe donkeys were our only salvation, for by instinct--it couldn't have\r\nbeen sight--they followed the trail along the base of the cliffs. By\r\nkeeping my hands upon the back of the rearmost animal, and the two\r\nMongols close to me, we got out of the cañon and into the wider valley.\r\nWhen we reached the village I was hungry enough to eat chips, for I had\r\nhad only three pears since six o'clock in the morning, and it was then\r\nnine at night.\r\n\r\nHarry, limping into camp just after dark, had met my cousin, Commander\r\nThomas Hutchins, Naval Attaché of the American Legation, and Major\r\nAustin Barker of the British Army, whom we had been expecting. They\r\nhad reached the village about ten o'clock in the morning and spent\r\nthe afternoon shooting hares near a beautiful temple which Harry had\r\ndiscovered among the hills three miles from camp. The boys had waited\r\ndinner for me, and we ate it amid a gale of laughter--we were always\r\nlaughing during the five days that Tom and Barker were with us.\r\n\r\nHarry was out of the hunting the next day because his leg needed a\r\ncomplete rest. I took Tom out with me, while Barker was piloted by an\r\nold Mongol who gave promise of being a good hunter. Tom and I climbed\r\nthe white trail to the summit of the ridge, while Barker turned off to\r\nthe left to gain the peaks on the other side of the gorge. Na-mon-gin\r\nwas keen for the big ram which I had missed the day before. He had a\r\nvery definite impression of just where that sheep was to be found, and\r\nhe completely ignored the ravines on either side of the trail.\r\n\r\nNot half a mile from the summit of the pass, the Mongol stopped and\r\nsaid, \"_Pan-yang_--on that ridge across the valley,\" He looked again\r\nand turned to me with a smile. \"It is the same ram,\" he said. \"I knew\r\nhe would be here.\" Sure enough, when I found the sheep with my glasses,\r\nI recognized our old friend. The little ewe was with him, and they had\r\nbeen joined by another ram carrying a circlet of horns, not far short\r\nof the big fellow's in size.\r\n\r\nFor half an hour we watched them while the Mongols smoked. The sheep\r\nwere standing on the very crest of a ridge across the river, moving\r\na few steps now and then, but never going far from where we first\r\ndiscovered them. My hunter said that soon they would go to sleep, and\r\nin less than half an hour they filed down hill into the valley; then\r\nwe, too, went down, crossed a low ridge, and descended to the river's\r\nedge. The climb up the other side was decidedly stiff, and it was\r\nnearly an hour before we were peering into the ravine where the sheep\r\nhad disappeared. They were not there, and the hunter said they had gone\r\neither up or down the valley--he could not tell which way.\r\n\r\nWe went up first, but no sheep. Then we crossed to the ridge where\r\nwe had first seen the _argali_ and cautiously looked over a ledge of\r\nrocks. There they were, about three hundred yards below, and on the\r\nalert, for they had seen Tom's hunter, who had carelessly exposed\r\nhimself on the crest of the ridge. Tom fired hurriedly, neglecting to\r\nremember that he was shooting down hill, and, consequently, overshot\r\nthe big ram. They rushed off, two shots of mine falling short at nearly\r\nfour hundred yards as they disappeared behind a rocky ledge.\r\n\r\nMy Mongol said that we might intercept them if we hurried, and he\r\nled me a merry chase into the bottom of the ravine and up the other\r\nside. The sheep were there, but standing in an amphitheater formed by\r\ninaccessible cliffs. I advocated going to the ridge above and trying\r\nfor a shot, but the hunter scoffed at the idea. He said that they would\r\nsurely scent or hear us long before we could see them.\r\n\r\nTom and his Mongol joined us in a short time, and for an hour we lay\r\nin the sunshine waiting for the sheep to compose themselves. It was\r\ndelightfully warm, and we were perfectly content to remain all the\r\nafternoon amid the glorious panorama of encircling peaks.\r\n\r\nAt last Na-mon-gin prepared to leave. He indicated that we were to go\r\nbelow and that Tom's hunter was to drive the sheep toward us. When we\r\nreached the river, the Mongol placed Tom behind a rock at the mouth\r\nof the amphitheater. He took me halfway up the slope, and we settled\r\nourselves behind two bowlders.\r\n\r\nI was breathing hard from the strenuous climb, and the old fellow\r\nwaited until I was ready to shoot; then he gave a signal, and Tom's\r\nhunter appeared at the very summit of the rocky amphitheater. Instantly\r\nthe sheep were on the move, running directly toward us. They seemed\r\nto be as large as elephants, for never before had I been as close to\r\na living _argali_. Just as the animals mounted the crest of a rocky\r\nledge, not more than fifty yards away, Na-mon-gin whistled sharply, and\r\nthe sheep stopped as though turned to stone.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he whispered, \"shoot.\" As I brought my rifle to the level\r\nit banged in the air. I had been showing the hunters how to use\r\nthe delicate set-trigger, and had carelessly left it on. The sheep\r\ninstantly dashed away, but there was only one avenue of escape, and\r\nthat was down hill past me. My second shot broke the hind leg of\r\nthe big ram; the third struck him in the abdomen, low down, and he\r\nstaggered, but kept on. The sheep had reached the bottom of the valley\r\nbefore my fourth bullet broke his neck.\r\n\r\nTom opened fire when the other ram and the ewe appeared at the mouth\r\nof the amphitheater, but his rear sight had been loosened in the climb\r\ndown the cliff, and his shots went wild. It was hard luck, for I was\r\nvery anxious to have him kill an _argali_.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen shot would have finished the big ram eventually, and I\r\nmight have killed the other before it crossed the creek; but experience\r\nhas taught me that it is best to take no chances with a wounded animal\r\nin rough country such as this. I have lost too many specimens by being\r\nloath to finish them off when they were badly hit.\r\n\r\nPLATE XIV\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE THE BIGHORN SHEEP ARE FOUND]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MONGOLIAN ROEBUCK]\r\n\r\nMy ram was a beauty. His horns were almost equal to those of the\r\nrecord head which Harry had killed on the first day, but one of them\r\nwas marred by a broken tip. The old warrior must have weathered nearly\r\na score of winters and have had many battles. But his new coat was\r\nthick and fine--the most beautiful of any we had seen. As he lay in\r\nthe bottom of the valley I was impressed again by the enormous size\r\nof an _argali's_ body. There was an excellent opportunity to compare\r\nit with a donkey's, for before we had finished our smoke, a Mongol\r\narrived driving two animals before him. The sheep was about one-third\r\nlarger than the donkey, and with his tremendous neck and head must have\r\nweighed a great deal more.\r\n\r\nAfter the ram had been skinned Tom and I left the men to pack in the\r\nmeat, skin, and head, while we climbed to the summit of the pass and\r\nwandered slowly home in the twilight. Major Barker came in shortly\r\nafter we reached the village. He was almost done, for his man had taken\r\nhim into the rough country north of camp. A strenuous day for a man\r\njust from the city, but Barker was enthusiastic. Even though he had\r\nnot killed a ram, he had wounded one in the leg and had counted twenty\r\nsheep--more than either Harry or I had seen during the entire time we\r\nhad been at Wu-shi-tu.\r\n\r\nWhen we awoke at five o'clock in the morning, Tom stretched himself\r\nvery gingerly and remarked that the only parts of him which weren't\r\nsore were his eyelids! Harry was still _hors de combat_ with the\r\nstrained tendon in his leg, and I had the beginning of an attack of\r\ninfluenza. Barker admitted that his joints \"creaked\" considerably;\r\nstill, he was full of enthusiasm. We started off together but separated\r\nwhen six miles from camp. He found sheep on the uplands almost at\r\nonce, but did not get a head. Barker was greatly handicapped by using\r\na special model U. S. Army Springfield rifle, which weighed almost as\r\nmuch as a machine gun, and could not have been less fitted for hunting\r\nin rough country. No man ever worked harder for an _argali_ than he\r\ndid, and he deserved the best head in the mountains. By noon I was\r\nburning with fever and almost unable to drag myself back to camp. I\r\narrived at four o'clock, just after Tom returned. He had not seen a\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nThe Major hunted next day, but was unsuccessful, and none of us went to\r\nthe mountains again, for I had nearly a week in bed, and Harry was only\r\nable to hobble about the court. On the 28th of October, Tom and Barker\r\nleft for Peking. Harry and I were sorry to have them leave us. I have\r\ncamped with many men in many countries of the world, but with no two\r\nwho were better field companions. Neither Harry nor I will ever forget\r\nthe happy days with them.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that I could not hunt again for at least a week,\r\nalthough I could sit a horse. We had seven sheep, and the group was\r\nassured; therefore, we decided to shift camp to the wapiti country,\r\nfifty miles away hoping that by the time we reached there, we both\r\nwould be fit again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE \"HORSE-DEER\" OF SHANSI\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the morning our carts had humped and rattled over the stones in a\r\nsomber valley one hundred and fifty _li_[2] from where we had killed\r\nthe sheep. With every mile the precipitous cliffs pressed in more\r\nclosely upon us until at last the gorge was blocked by a sheer wall\r\nof rock. Our destination was a village named Wu-tai-hai, but there\r\nappeared to be no possible place for a village in that narrow cañon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A _li_ equals about one-third of a mile.]\r\n\r\nWe were a quarter of a mile from the barrier before we could\r\ndistinguish a group of mud-walled huts, seemingly plastered against\r\nthe rock like a collection of swallows' nests. No one but a Chinese\r\nwould have dreamed of building a house in that desolate place. It\r\nwas Wu-tai-hai, without a doubt, and Harry and I rode forward to\r\ninvestigate.\r\n\r\nAt the door of a tiny hut we were met by one of our Chinese\r\ntaxidermists. He ushered us into the court and, with a wave of his\r\nhand, announced, \"This is the American Legation.\" The yard was a mass\r\nof straw and mud. From the gaping windows of the house bits of torn\r\npaper fluttered in the wind; inside, at one end of the largest room,\r\nwas a bed platform made of mud; at the other, a fat mother hog with\r\nfive squirming \"piglets\" sprawled contentedly on the dirt floor. Six\r\nyears before Colonel (then Captain) Thomas Holcomb, of the United\r\nStates Marine Corps, had spent several days at this hut while hunting\r\nelk. Therefore, it will be known to Peking Chinese until the end of\r\ntime as the \"American Legation.\"\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the remaining houses in the village disclosed no\r\nbetter quarters, so our boys ousted the sow and her family, swept the\r\nhouse, spread the _kang_ and floor with clean straw, and pasted fresh\r\npaper over the windows. We longed to use our tents, but there was\r\nnothing except straw or grass to burn, and cooking would be impossible.\r\nThe villagers were too poor to buy coal from Kwei-hua-cheng, forty\r\nmiles away, and there was not a sign of wood on the bare, brown hills.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the _kang_, in these north Shansi houses, there is\r\nalways a clay stove which supports a huge iron pot. A hand bellows is\r\nbuilt into the side of the stove, and by feeding straw or grass with\r\none hand and energetically manipulating the bellows with the other, a\r\nfire sufficient for simple cooking is obtained.\r\n\r\nExcept for a few hours of the day the house is as cold as the yard\r\noutside, but the natives mind it not at all. Men and women alike dress\r\nin sheepskin coats and padded cotton trousers. They do not expect to\r\nremove their clothing when they come indoors, and warmth, except at\r\nnight, is a nonessential in their scheme of life. A system of flues\r\ndraws the heat from the cooking fires underneath the _kang_, and the\r\nclay bricks retain their temperature for several horn's.\r\n\r\nAt best the north China natives lead a cheerless existence in winter.\r\nThe house is not a home. Dark, cold, dirty, it is merely a place in\r\nwhich to eat and sleep. There is no home-making instinct in the Chinese\r\nwife, for a centuries' old social system, based on the Confucian\r\nethics, has smothered every thought of the privileges of womanhood. Her\r\nplace is to cook, sew, and bear children; to reflect only the thoughts\r\nof her lord and master--to have none of her own.\r\n\r\nWu-tai-hai was typical of villages of its class in all north China;\r\nmud huts, each with a tiny courtyard, built end to end in a corner of\r\nthe hillside. A few acres of ground in the valley bottom and on the\r\nmountain side capable of cultivation yield enough wheat, corn, turnips,\r\ncabbages, and potatoes to give the natives food. Their life is one of\r\nwork with few pleasures, and yet they are content because they know\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\nImagine, then, what it meant when we suddenly injected ourselves into\r\ntheir midst. We had come from a world beyond the mountains--a world\r\nof which they had sometimes heard, but which was as unreal to them as\r\nthat of another planet. Europe and America were merely names. A few had\r\nlearned from passing soldiers that these strange men in that dim, far\r\nland had been fighting among themselves and that China, too, was in\r\nsome vague way connected with the struggle.\r\n\r\nBut it had not affected them in their tiny rock-bound village. Their\r\nworld was encompassed within the valley walls or, in its uttermost\r\nlimits, extended to Kwei-hua-cheng, forty miles away. They knew, even,\r\nthat a \"fire carriage\" running on two rails of steel came regularly to\r\nFeng-chen, four days' travel to the east, but few of them had ever seen\r\nit. So it was almost as unreal as stories of the war and aëroplanes and\r\nautomobiles.\r\n\r\nAll the village gathered at the \"American Legation\" while we\r\nunpacked our carts. They gazed in silent awe at our guns and cameras\r\nand sleeping bags, but the trays of specimens brought forth an\r\nactive response. Here was something that was a part of their own\r\nlife--something they could understand. Mice and rabbits like these they\r\nhad seen in their own fields; that weasel was the same kind of animal\r\nwhich sometimes stole their chickens. They pointed to the rocks when\r\nthey saw a red-legged partridge, and told us there were many there;\r\nalso pheasants.\r\n\r\nWhy we wanted the skins they could not understand, of course. I told\r\nthem that we would take them far away across the ocean to America and\r\nput them in a great house as large as that hill across the valley; but\r\nthey smilingly shook their heads. The ocean meant nothing to them, and\r\nas for a house as large as a hill--well, there never could be such a\r\nplace. They were perfectly sure of that.\r\n\r\nWe had come to Wu-tai-hai to hunt wapiti--_ma-lu_ (horse-deer) the\r\nnatives call them--and they assured us that we could find them on the\r\nmountains behind the village. Only last night, said one of the men, he\r\nhad seen four standing on the hillside. Two had antlers as long as that\r\nstick, but they were no good now--the horns were hard--we should have\r\ncome in the spring when they were soft. Then each pair was worth $150,\r\nat least, and big ones even more. The doctors make wonderful medicine\r\nfrom the horns--only a little of it would cure any disease no matter\r\nhow bad it was. They themselves could not get the _ma-lu_, for the\r\nsoldiers had long since taken away all their guns, but they would show\r\nus where they were.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant to hear all this, for we wanted some of those wapiti\r\nvery badly, indeed. It is one of the links in the chain of evidence\r\nconnecting the animals of the Old World and the New--the problem which\r\nmakes Asia the most fascinating hunting ground of all the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen the early settlers first penetrated the forests of America they\r\nfound the great deer which the Indians called \"wapiti.\" It was supposed\r\nfor many years that it inhabited only America, but not long ago similar\r\ndeer were discovered in China, Manchuria, Korea, Mongolia, Siberia,\r\nand Turkestan, where undoubtedly the American species originated. Its\r\nwhite discoverers erroneously named the animal \"elk,\" but as this title\r\nproperly belongs to the European \"moose,\" sportsmen have adopted the\r\nIndian name \"wapiti\" to avoid confusion. Of course, changed environment\r\ndeveloped different \"species\" in all the animals which migrated from\r\nAsia either to Europe or America, but their relationships are very\r\nclose, indeed.\r\n\r\nThe particular wapiti which we hoped to get at Wu-tai-hai represented\r\na species almost extinct in China. Because of relentless persecution\r\nwhen the antlers are growing and in the \"velvet\" and continual cutting\r\nof the forests only a few individuals remain in this remote corner\r\nof northern Shansi Province. These will soon all be killed, for\r\nthe railroad is being extended to within a few miles of their last\r\nstronghold, and sportsmen will flock to the hills from the treaty ports\r\nof China.\r\n\r\nOur first hunt was on November first. We left camp by a short cut\r\nbehind the village and descended to the bowlder-strewn bed of the creek\r\nwhich led into a tremendous gorge. We felt very small and helpless as\r\nour eyes traveled up the well-nigh vertical walls to the ragged edge\r\nof the chasm a thousand feet above us. The mightiness of it all was\r\nvaguely depressing, and it was with a distinct feeling of relief that\r\nwe saw the cañon widen suddenly into a gigantic amphitheater. In its\r\nvery center, rising from a ragged granite pedestal, a pinnacle of rock,\r\ncrowned by a tiny temple, shot into the air. It was three hundred feet,\r\nat least, from the stream bed to the summit of the spire--and what a\r\ncolossal task it must have been to transport the building materials for\r\nthe temple up the sheer sides of rock! The valley sinners must gain\r\nmuch merit from the danger and effort involved in climbing there to\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nFarther on we passed two villages and then turned off to the right up\r\na tributary valley. We were anxiously looking for signs of forest, but\r\nthe only possible cover was in a few ravines where a sparse growth of\r\nbirch and poplar bushes, not more than six or eight feet high, grew on\r\nthe north slope. Moreover, we could see that the valley ended in open\r\nrolling uplands.\r\n\r\nPLATE XV\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HEAD OF THE RECORD RAM]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF MONGOLIA AND CHINA SHOWING ROUTE OF SECOND\r\nASIATIC EXPEDITION IN BROKEN LINES]\r\n\r\nTurning to Na-mon-gin, I said, \"How much farther are the _ma-lu?_\"\r\n\"Here,\" he answered. \"We have already arrived. They are in the bushes\r\non the mountain side.\"\r\n\r\nCaldwell and I were astounded. The idea of looking for wapiti in such\r\na place seemed too absurd! There was hardly enough cover successfully\r\nto conceal a rabbit, to say nothing of an animal as large as a horse.\r\nNevertheless, the hunters assured us that the _ma-lu_ were there, and\r\nwe began to take a new interest in the birch scrub. Almost immediately\r\nwe saw three roebuck near the rim of one of the ravines, their white\r\nrump-patches showing conspicuously as they bobbed about in the thin\r\ncover. We could have killed them easily, but the hunters would not let\r\nus shoot, for we were after larger game.\r\n\r\nA few moments later we separated, Harry keeping on up the main valley,\r\nwhile my hunter and I turned into a patch of brush directly above us.\r\nWe had not gone fifty yards when there was a crash, a rush of feet, and\r\nfour wapiti dashed through the bushes. The three cows kept straight on,\r\nbut the bull stopped just on the crest of the ridge directly behind\r\na thick screen of twigs. My rifle was sighted at the huge body dimly\r\nvisible through the branches. In a moment I would have touched the\r\ntrigger, but the hunter caught my arm, whispering frantically, \"Don't\r\nshoot! Don't shoot!\"\r\n\r\nOf course I knew it was a long chance, for the bullet almost certainly\r\nwould have been deflected by the twigs, but those splendid antlers\r\nseemed very near and very, very desirable. I lowered my rifle\r\nreluctantly, and the bull disappeared over the hill crest whence the\r\ncows had gone.\r\n\r\n\"They'll stop in the next ravine,\" said the hunter, but when we\r\ncautiously peered over the ridge the animals were not there--nor were\r\nthey in the next. At last we found their trail leading into the grassy\r\nuplands; but the possibility of finding wapiti, these animals of the\r\nforests, on those treeless slopes seemed too absurd even to consider.\r\nYet, the old Mongol kept straight on across the rolling meadow.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, off at the right, Harry's rifle banged three times in quick\r\nsuccession--then an interval, and two more shots. Ten seconds later\r\nthree wapiti cows showed black against the sky line. They were coming\r\nfast and straight toward us. We flattened ourselves in the grass, lying\r\nas motionless as two gray bowlders, and a moment later another wapiti\r\nappeared behind the cows. As the sun glistened on his branching antlers\r\nthere was no doubt that he was a bull, and a big one, too.\r\n\r\nThe cows were headed to pass about two hundred yards above us and\r\nbehind the hill crest. I could easily have reached the summit where\r\nthey would have been at my mercy, but lower down the big bull also\r\nwas coming, and the hunter would not let me move. \"Wait, wait,\" he\r\nwhispered, \"we'll surely get him. Wait, we can't lose him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about that ravine?\" I answered. \"He'll go into the cover. He will\r\nnever come across this open hillside. I'm going to shoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, he won't turn there. I am sure he won't.\" The Mongol was\r\nright. The big fellow ran straight toward us until he came to the\r\nentrance to the valley. My heart was in my mouth as he stopped for an\r\ninstant and looked down into the cover. Then, for some strange reason,\r\nhe turned and came on. Three hundred yards away he halted suddenly,\r\nswung about, and looked at the ravine again as if half decided to go\r\nback.\r\n\r\nHe was standing broadside, and at the crash of my rifle we could hear\r\nthe soft thud of the bullet striking flesh; but without a sign of\r\ninjury he ran forward and stopped under a swell of ground. I could\r\nsee just ten inches of his back and the magnificent head. It was a\r\nsmall target at three hundred yards, and I missed him twice. With the\r\ngreatest care I held the little ivory bead well down on that thin brown\r\nline, but the bullet only creased his back. It was no use--I simply\r\ncould not hit him. Running up the hill a few feet, I had his whole body\r\nexposed, and the first shot put him down for good.\r\n\r\nWith a whoop of joy my old Mongol dashed down the steep slope. I had\r\nnever seen him excited while we were hunting sheep, but now he was wild\r\nwith delight. Before he had quieted we saw Harry coming over the hill\r\nwhere the wapiti had first appeared. He told us that he had knocked\r\nthe bull down at long range and had expected to find him dead until he\r\nheard me shooting. We found where his bullet had struck the wapiti in\r\nthe shoulder, yet the animal was running as though untouched.\r\n\r\nI examined the bull with the greatest interest, for it was the first\r\nAsiatic wapiti of this species that I had ever seen. Its splendid\r\nantlers carried eleven points but they were not as massive in the beam\r\nor as sharply bent backward at the tips as are those of the American\r\nelk. Because of its richer coloration, however, it was decidedly\r\nhandsomer than any of the American animals.\r\n\r\nBut the really extraordinary thing was to find the wapiti there at\r\nall. It seemed as incongruous as the first automobile that I saw upon\r\nthe Gobi Desert, for in every other part of the world the animal is a\r\nresident of the parklike openings in the forests. Here not a twig or\r\nbush was in sight, only the rolling, grass-covered uplands. Undoubtedly\r\nthese mountains had been wooded many years ago, and as the trees\r\nwere cut away, the animals had no alternative except to die or adapt\r\nthemselves to almost plains conditions. The sparse birch scrub in the\r\nravines still afforded them limited protection during the day, but they\r\ncould feed only at night. It was a case of rapid adaptation to changed\r\nenvironment such as I have seen nowhere else in all the world.\r\n\r\nThe wapiti, of course, owed their continued existence to the fact that\r\nthe Chinese villagers of the valley had no firearms; otherwise, when\r\nthe growing antlers set a price upon their heads, they would all have\r\nbeen exterminated within a year or two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nWAPITI, ROEBUCK, AND GORAL\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the first day we left the \"American Legation\" and moved camp to\r\none of two villages at the upper end of the valley about a mile nearer\r\nthe hunting grounds. There were only half a dozen huts, but they were\r\nsomewhat superior to those of Wu-tai-hai, and we were able to make\r\nourselves fairly comfortable. The usual threshing floor of hard clay\r\nadjoined each house, and all day we could hear the steady beat, beat,\r\nbeat, of the flails pounding out the wheat.\r\n\r\nThe grain was usually freed from chaff by the simple process of\r\nthrowing it into the air when a brisk wind was blowing, but we saw\r\nseveral hand winnowing machines which were exceedingly ingenious and\r\nvery effective. The wheat was ground between two circular stones\r\noperated by a blindfolded donkey which plodded round and round tied to\r\na shaft. Of course, had the animal been able to see he would not have\r\nwalked continuously in a circle without giving trouble to his master.\r\n\r\nBehind our new house the cliffs rose in sheer walls for hundreds of\r\nfeet, and red-legged partridges, or chuckars, were always calling from\r\nsome ledge or bowlder. We could have excellent shooting at almost any\r\nhour of the day and often picked up pheasants, bearded partridges, and\r\nrabbits in the tiny fields across the stream. Besides the wapiti and\r\nroebuck, goral were plentiful on the cliffs and there were a few sheep\r\nin the lower valley. Altogether it was a veritable game paradise, but\r\none which I fear will last only a few years longer.\r\n\r\nWe found that the wapiti were not as easy to kill as the first day's\r\nhunt had given us reason to believe. The mountains, separated by deep\r\nravines, were so high and precipitous that if the deer became alarmed\r\nand crossed a valley it meant a climb of an hour or more to reach the\r\ncrest of the new ridge. It was killing work, and we returned to camp\r\nevery night utterly exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe concentration of animal life in these scrub-filled gorges was\r\nreally extraordinary, and I hope that a \"game hog\" never finds that\r\nvalley. Probably in no other part of China can one see as many roebuck\r\nin a space so limited. It is due, of course, to the unusual conditions.\r\nInstead of being scattered over a large area, as is usual in the forest\r\nwhere there is an abundance of cover, the animals are confined to the\r\nfew ravines in which brush remains. The surrounding open hills isolate\r\nthem almost as effectively as though they were encircled by water; when\r\ndriven from one patch of cover they can only run to the next valley.\r\n\r\nThe facility with which the roebuck and wapiti had adapted themselves\r\nto utterly new conditions was a continual marvel to me, and I never\r\nlost the feeling of surprise when I saw the animals on the open\r\nhillside or running across the rolling, treeless uplands. Had an\r\nelephant or a rhinoceros suddenly appeared in place of a deer, it would\r\nnot have seemed more incongruous.\r\n\r\nAfter we had killed the first wapiti we did not fire a shot for two\r\ndays, even though roebuck were all about us and we wanted a series for\r\nthe Museum. This species, _Capreolus bedfordi_, is smaller both in\r\nbody and in antlers than the one we obtained in Mongolia and differs\r\ndecidedly in coloration.\r\n\r\nOn the second hunt I, alone, saw forty-five roebuck, and Harry, who\r\nwas far to the north of me, counted thirty-one. The third day we were\r\ntogether and put out at least half as many. During that time we saw\r\ntwo wapiti, but did not get a shot at either. Both of us were becoming\r\ndecidedly tired of passing specimens which we wanted badly and decided\r\nto go for roebuck regardless of the possibility of frightening wapiti\r\nby the shooting. Na-mon-gin and the other hunters were disgusted with\r\nour decision, for they were only interested in the larger game. For\r\nthe first two drives they worked only half-heartedly, and although\r\nseventeen deer were put out of one ravine, they escaped without giving\r\nus a shot.\r\n\r\nHarry and I held a council of war with the natives and impressed\r\nupon them the fact that we were intending to hunt roebuck that day\r\nregardless of their personal wishes. They realized that we were not to\r\nbe dissuaded and prepared to drive the next patch of cover in a really\r\nbusinesslike manner.\r\n\r\nNa-mon-gin took me to a position on the edge of a projecting rock to\r\nawait the natives. As they appeared on the rim of the ravine we saw\r\nfive roe deer move in the bushes where they had been asleep. Four of\r\nthem broke back through the line of beaters, but one fine buck came\r\nstraight toward us. He ran up the slope and crossed a rock-saddle\r\nalmost beneath me, but I did not fire until he was well away on the\r\nopposite hillside; then he plunged forward in his tracks, dead.\r\n\r\nWithout moving from our position we sent the men over the crest of the\r\nmountain to drive the ravines on the other side. The old Mongol and I\r\nstretched out upon the rock and smoked for half an hour, while I tried\r\nto tell him in my best Chinese--which is very bad--the story of a bear\r\nhunt in Alaska. I had just killed the bear, in my narrative, when we\r\nsaw five roebuck appear on the sky line. They trotted straight toward\r\nHarry, and in a moment we heard two shots in quick succession. I knew\r\nthat meant at least one more deer.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later we made out a roebuck rounding the base of the\r\nspur on which we sat. It seemed no larger than a brown rabbit at that\r\ndistance, but the animal was running directly up the bottom of the\r\nravine which we commanded. It was a buck carrying splendid antlers and\r\nwe watched him come steadily on until he was almost below us.\r\n\r\nNa-mon-gin whispered, \"Don't shoot until he stops\"; but it seemed that\r\nthe animal would cross the ridge without a pause. He was almost at the\r\nsummit when he halted for an instant, facing directly away from us. I\r\nfired, and the buck leaped backward shot through the neck.\r\n\r\nNa-mon-gin was in high good humor, for I had killed two deer with two\r\nshots. Harry brought a splendid doe which he had bored neatly through\r\nthe body as it dashed at full speed across the valley below him. Even\r\nthe old Mongol had to admit that the wapiti could not have been greatly\r\ndisturbed by the shooting, and all the men were as pleased as children.\r\nThere was meat enough for all our boys as well as for the beaters.\r\n\r\nOur next day's hunt was for goral on the precipitous cliffs north of\r\ncamp. Goral belong to a most interesting group of mammals known as the\r\n\"goat-antelopes\" because of the intermediate position which they occupy\r\nbetween the true antelope and the goats. The takin, serow, and goral\r\nare the Asiatic members of this sub-family, the _Rupicaprinæ_, which\r\nis represented in America by the so-called Rocky Mountain goat and in\r\nEurope by the chamois. The goral might be called the Asiatic chamois,\r\nfor its habits closely resemble those of its European relative.\r\n\r\nI had killed twenty-five goral in Yün-nan on the first Asiatic\r\nexpedition and, therefore, was not particularly keen, from the sporting\r\nstandpoint, about shooting others. But we did need several specimens,\r\nsince the north China goral represents a different species, _Nemorhædus\r\ncaudatus_; from the one we had obtained in Yün-nan, which is _N.\r\ngriseus_.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Harry was exceedingly anxious to get several of the animals\r\nfor he had not been very successful with them. He had shot one at\r\nWu-shi-tu, while we were hunting sheep, and after wounding two others\r\nat Wu-tai-hai had begun to learn how hard they are to kill.\r\n\r\nThe thousand-foot climb up the almost perpendicular cliff was one of\r\nthe most difficult bits of going which we encountered anywhere in the\r\nmountains, and I was ready for a rest in the sun when we reached the\r\nsummit. Although my beaters were not successful in putting out a goral,\r\nwe heard Harry shoot once away to the right; and half an hour later I\r\nsaw him through my binoculars accompanied by one of his men who carried\r\na goral on his shoulders.\r\n\r\nOn the way Harry disturbed a goral which ran down the sheer wall\r\nopposite to us at full speed, bouncing from rock to rock as though\r\nmade of India rubber. It was almost inconceivable that anything except\r\na bird could move along the face of that cliff, and yet the goral ran\r\napparently as easily as though it had been on level ground. I missed\r\nit beautifully and the animal disappeared into a cave among the rocks.\r\nAlthough I sent two bullets into the hole, hoping to drive out the\r\nbeast, it would not move. Two beaters made their way from above to\r\nwithin thirty feet of the hiding place and sent down a shower of dirt\r\nand stones, but still there was no sign of action. Then another native\r\nclimbed up from below at the risk of his life, and just as he gained\r\nthe ledge which led to the cave the goral leaped out. The Mongol yelled\r\nwith fright, for the animal nearly shoved him off the rocks and dashed\r\ninto the bottom of the ravine where it took refuge in another cave.\r\n\r\nI would not have taken that thousand-foot climb again for all the\r\ngorals in China, but Harry started down at once. The animal again\r\nremained in its cave until a beater was opposite the entrance and then\r\nshot out like an arrow almost into Harry's face. He was so startled\r\nthat he missed it twice.\r\n\r\nI decided to abandon goral hunting for that day. Na-mon-gin took me\r\nover the summit of the ridge with two beaters and we found roebuck at\r\nonce. I returned to camp with two bucks and a doe. In the lower valley\r\nI met Harry carrying a shotgun and accompanied by a boy strung about\r\nwith pheasants and chuckars. After losing the goral he had toiled up\r\nthe mountain again but had found only two roebuck, one of which he shot.\r\n\r\nOur second wapiti was killed on November seventh. It was a raw day with\r\nan icy wind blowing across the ridges where we lay for half an hour\r\nwhile the beaters bungled a drive for twelve roebuck which had gone\r\ninto a scrub-filled ravine. The animals eluded us by running across\r\na hilltop which should have been blocked by a native, and I got only\r\none shot at a fox. The report of my rifle disturbed eight wapiti which\r\nthe beaters discovered as they crossed the uplands in the direction of\r\nanother patch of cover a mile away.\r\n\r\nIt was a long, cold walk over the hills against the biting wind, and\r\nafter driving one ravine unsuccessfully Harry descended to the bottom\r\nof a wide valley, while I continued parallel with him on the summit\r\nof the ridge. Three roebuck suddenly jumped from a shallow ravine in\r\nfront of me, and one of them, a splendid buck, stopped behind a bush.\r\nIt was too great a temptation, so I fired; but the bullet went to\r\npieces in the twigs and never reached its mark. Harry saw the deer go\r\nover the hill and ran around the base of a rocky shoulder just in time\r\nto intercept three wapiti which my shot had started down the ravine.\r\nHe dropped behind a bowlder and let a cow and a calf pass within a\r\nfew yards of him, for he saw the antlers of a bull rocking along just\r\nbehind a tiny ridge. As the animal came into view he sent a bullet into\r\nhis shoulder, and a second ball a few inches behind the first. The elk\r\nwent down but got to his feet again, and Harry put him under for good\r\nwith a third shot in the hip.\r\n\r\nLooking up he saw another bull, alone, emerging from a patch of cover\r\non the summit of the opposite slope four hundred yards away. He fired\r\npoint-blank, but the range was a bit too long and his bullet kicked up\r\na cloud of snow under the animal's belly.\r\n\r\nI was entirely out of the race on the summit of the hill, for the\r\nnearest wapiti was fully eight hundred yards away. Harry's bull was\r\nsomewhat smaller than the first one we had killed, but had an even more\r\nbeautiful coat.\r\n\r\nWe were pretty well exhausted from the week's strenuous climbing and\r\nspent Sunday resting and looking after the small mammal work which our\r\nChinese taxidermists had been carrying on under my direction.\r\n\r\nMonday morning we were on the hunting grounds shortly after sunrise.\r\nAt the first drive a beautiful buck roe deer ran out of a ravine into\r\nthe main valley where I was stationed. Suddenly he caught sight of\r\nus where we sat under a rock and stopped with head thrown up and one\r\nfoot raised, I shall never forget the beautiful picture which he made\r\nstanding there against the background of snow with the sun glancing on\r\nhis antlers. Before I could shoot he was off at top speed bounding over\r\nthe bushes parallel to us. My first shot just creased his back, but the\r\nsecond caught him squarely in the shoulder, while he was in mid-air,\r\nturning him over in a complete somersault.\r\n\r\nA few moments later we saw the two beaters on the hill run toward each\r\nother excitedly and felt sure they had seen something besides roebuck.\r\nWhen they reached us they reported that seven wapiti had run out\r\ndirectly between them and over the ridge.\r\n\r\nThe climb to the top of the mountain was an ordeal. It was the highest\r\nridge on that side of the valley and every time we reached what\r\nappeared to be the crest, another and higher summit loomed above us.\r\nWe followed the tracks of the animals into a series of ravines which\r\nran down on the opposite side of the mountain and tried a drive. It was\r\ntoo large a territory for our four beaters, and the animals escaped\r\nunobserved up one of the valleys. Na-mon-gin and I sat on the hillside\r\nfor an hour in the icy wind. We were both shaking with cold and I doubt\r\nif I could have hit a wapiti if it had stopped fifty feet away.\r\n\r\nHarry saw a young elk go into a mass of birch scrub in the bottom\r\nof the valley, and when he descended to drive it out, his hunter\r\ndiscovered a huge bull walking slowly up a ravine not two hundred\r\nyards from me but under cover of the hill and beyond my sight.\r\n\r\nA little before dark we started home by way of a deep ravine which\r\nextended out to the main valley. We were talking in a low tone and I\r\nwas smoking a cigarette--my rifle slung over my shoulder. Suddenly\r\nHarry exclaimed, \"Great Scott, Roy! There's a _ma-lu_.\"\r\n\r\nOn the instant his rifle banged, and I looked up just in time to see\r\na bull wapiti stop on an open slope of the ravine about ninety yards\r\naway. Before I had unslung my rifle Harry fired again, but he could not\r\nsee the notch in his rear sight and both bullets went high.\r\n\r\nThrough the peep sight in my Mannlicher the animal was perfectly\r\nvisible, and when I fired, the bull dropped like lead, rolling over and\r\nover down the hill. He attempted to get to his feet but was unable to\r\nstand, and I put him down for good with a second shot. It all happened\r\nso quickly that we could hardly realize that a day of disappointment\r\nhad ended in success.\r\n\r\nOn our way back to camp Harry and I decided that this would end our\r\nhunt, for we had three fine bulls, and it was evident that only a very\r\nfew wapiti remained. The species is doomed to early extinction for,\r\nwith the advent of the railroad, the last stand which the elk have\r\nmade by means of their extraordinary adaptation to changed conditions\r\nwill soon become easily accessible to foreign sportsmen. We at least\r\ncould keep our consciences clear and not hasten the inevitable day by\r\nundue slaughter. In western China other species of wapiti are found in\r\ngreater numbers, but there can be only one end to the persecution to\r\nwhich they are subjected during the season when they are least able to\r\nprotect themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is too much to hope that China will make effective game laws\r\nbefore the most interesting and important forms of her wild life have\r\ndisappeared, but we can do our best to preserve in museums for future\r\ngenerations records of the splendid animals of the present. Not only\r\nare they a part of Chinese history, but they belong to all the world,\r\nfor they furnish some of the evidence from which it is possible to\r\nwrite the fascinating story of those dim, dark ages when man first came\r\nupon the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nWILD PIGS--ANIMAL AND HUMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nShansi Province is famous for wild boar among the sportsmen of China.\r\nIn the central part there are low mountains and deep ravines thickly\r\nforested with a scrub growth of pine and oak. The acorns are a favorite\r\nfood of the pigs, and the pigs are a favorite food of the Chinese--and\r\nof foreigners, too, for that matter. No domestic pork that I have ever\r\ntasted can excel a young acorn-fed wild pig! Even a full-grown sow\r\nis delicious, but beware of an old boar; not only is he tough beyond\r\ndescription, but his flesh is so \"strong\" that it annoys me even to see\r\nit cooked. I tried to eat some boar meat, once upon a time--that is why\r\nI feel so deeply about it.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to hunt wild pig until the leaves are off the trees, for\r\nyour only hope is to find them feeding on the hillsides in the morning\r\nor early evening. Then they will often come into the open or the thin\r\nforests, and you can have a fair shot across a ravine or from the\r\nsummit of a hill. If they are in the brush it is well-nigh impossible\r\nto see them at all. A wild boar is very clever at eluding his pursuers,\r\nand for his size can carry off more lead and requires more killing than\r\nany other animal of which I know. Therefore, you may be sure of a\r\ndecidedly interesting hunt. On the other hand, an unsuspecting pig is\r\neasy to stalk, for his eyesight is not good; his sense of smell is not\r\nmuch better; and he depends largely upon hearing to protect him from\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nIn Tientsin and Shanghai there are several sportsmen who year after\r\nyear go to try for record tusks--they are the real authorities on wild\r\nboar hunting. My own experience has been limited to perhaps a dozen\r\npigs killed in Korea, Mongolia, Celebes, and various parts of China.\r\n\r\nHarry Caldwell and I returned from our bighorn sheep and wapiti hunt\r\non November 19. He was anxious to go with me for wild boar, but\r\nbusiness required his presence in Foochow, and Everett Smith, who\r\nhad been my companion on a trip to the Eastern Tombs the previous\r\nspring, volunteered to accompany me. We left on November 28 by the\r\nPeking-Hankow Railroad for Ping-ting-cho, arriving the following\r\nafternoon at two o'clock. There we obtained donkeys for pack and\r\nriding animals. All the traffic in this part of Shansi is by mules or\r\ndonkeys. As a result the inns are small, with none of the spacious\r\ncourtyards which we had found in the north of the province. They were\r\nnot particularly dirty, but the open coal fires which burned in every\r\nkitchen sometimes drove us outside for a breath of untainted air. How\r\nit is possible for human beings to exist in rooms so filled with coal\r\ngas is beyond my knowledge. Of course, death from gas poisoning is not\r\nunusual, but I suppose the natives have become somewhat immune to its\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nOur destination was a tiny village in the mountains about eight miles\r\nbeyond Ho-shun, a city of considerable size in the very center of the\r\nprovince. Tai-yuan-fu, the capital, at the end of the railway, is\r\na famous place for pigs; but they have been hunted so persistently\r\nin recent years that few remain within less than two or three days'\r\njourney from the city.\r\n\r\nIt was a three days' trip from the railroad to Ho-shun, and there was\r\nlittle of interest to distinguish the road from any other in north\r\nChina. It is always monotonous to travel with pack animals or carts,\r\nfor they go so slowly that you can make only two or three miles an\r\nhour, at best. If there happens to be shooting along the way, as there\r\nis in most parts of Shansi, it helps to pass the time. We picked up a\r\nfew pheasants, some chuckars, and a dozen pigeons, but did not stop to\r\ndo any real hunting until we entered a wooded valley and established\r\nourselves in a fairly comfortable Chinese hut at the little village\r\nof Kao-chia-chuang. On the way in we met a party of Christian Brother\r\nmissionaries who had been hunting in the vicinity for five days. They\r\nhad seen ten or twelve pigs and had killed a splendid boar weighing\r\nabout three hundred and fifty pounds as well as two roebuck.\r\n\r\nThe mountains near the village had been so thoroughly hunted that\r\nthere was little chance of finding pigs, but nevertheless we decided\r\nto stay for a day or two. I killed a two-year-old roebuck on the first\r\nafternoon; and the next morning, while Smith and I were resting on a\r\nmountain trail, one of our men saw an enormous wild boar trot across\r\nan open ridge and disappear into a heavily forested ravine. I selected\r\na post on a projecting shoulder, while one Chinese went with Smith to\r\npick up the trail of the pig. There were so many avenues of escape open\r\nto the boar that I had to remain where it was possible to watch a large\r\nexpanse of country.\r\n\r\nSmith had not yet reached the bottom of the ravine when the native\r\nwho had remained with me suddenly began to gesticulate wildly and to\r\npoint to a wooded slope directly in front of us. He hopped about like\r\na man who has suddenly lost his mind and succeeded in keeping in front\r\nof me so that I could see nothing but his waving arms and writhing\r\nbody. Finally seizing him by the collar, I threw him to the ground so\r\nviolently that he realized his place was behind me. Then I saw the pig\r\nrunning along a narrow trail, silhouetted against the snow which lay\r\nthinly on the shaded side of the hill.\r\n\r\nHe was easily three hundred and fifty yards away and I had little hope\r\nof hitting him, but I selected an open patch beyond a bit of cover and\r\nfired as he emerged. The boar squealed and plunged forward into the\r\nbushes. A moment later he reappeared, zigzagging his way up the slope\r\nand only visible through the trees when he crossed a patch of snow. I\r\nemptied the magazine of my rifle in a futile bombardment, but the boar\r\ncrossed the summit and disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe picked up his bloody trail and for two hours followed it through a\r\ntangled mass of scrub and thorns. It seemed certain that we must find\r\nhim at any moment, for great red blotches stained the snow wherever he\r\nstopped to rest. At last the trail led us across an open ridge, and the\r\nsnow and blood suddenly ceased. We could not follow his footprints in\r\nthe thick grass and abandoned the chase just before dark.\r\n\r\nTwo more days of unsuccessful hunting convinced us that the\r\nmissionaries had driven the pigs to other cover. There was a region\r\ntwelve miles away to which they might have gone, and we shifted camp\r\nto a village named Tziloa a mile or more from the scrub-covered hills\r\nwhich we wished to investigate.\r\n\r\nThe natives of this part of the country were in no sense hunters. They\r\nwere farmers who, now that the crops were harvested, had plenty of\r\nleisure time and were glad to roam the hills with us. Although their\r\neyesight was remarkable and they were able to see a pig twice as far\r\nas we could, they had no conception of stalking the game or of how to\r\nhunt it. When we began to shoot, instead of watching the pigs, they\r\nwere always so anxious to obtain the empty cartridge cases that a wild\r\nscramble ensued after every shot. They were like street boys fighting\r\nfor a penny. It was a serious handicap for successful hunting, and they\r\nkept me in such a state of irritation that I never shot so badly in all\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\nWe found pigs at Tziloa immediately. The carts went by road to the\r\nvillage, while Smith and I, with two Chinese, crossed the mountains.\r\nOn the summit of a ridge not far from the village we met eight native\r\nhunters. Two of them had ancient muzzle-loading guns but the others\r\nonly carried staves. Evidently their method of hunting was to surround\r\nthe pigs and drive them close up to the men with firearms.\r\n\r\nWe persuaded one of the Chinese, a boy of eighteen, with cross-eyes\r\nand a funny, dried-up little face, to accompany us, for our two guides\r\nwished to return that night to Kao-chia-chuang. He led us down a spur\r\nwhich projected northward from the main ridge, and in ten minutes we\r\ndiscovered five pigs on the opposite side of a deep ravine. The sun lay\r\nwarmly on the slope, and the animals were lazily rooting in the oak\r\nscrub. They were a happy family--a boar, a sow, and three half-grown\r\npiglets.\r\n\r\nWe slipped quietly among the trees until we were directly opposite to\r\nthem and not more than two hundred yards away. The boar and the sow had\r\ndisappeared behind a rocky corner, and the others were slowly following\r\nso that the opportunity for a shot would soon be lost. Telling Smith to\r\ntake the one on the left, I covered another which stood, half facing\r\nme. At the roar of my rifle the ravine was filled with wild squeals,\r\nand the pig rolled down the hill bringing up against a tree. The boar\r\nrushed from behind the rock, and I fired quickly as he stood broadside\r\non. He plunged out of sight, and the gorge was still!\r\n\r\nSmith had missed his pig and was very much disgusted. The three Chinese\r\nthrew themselves down the slope, slipping and rolling over logs and\r\nstones, and were up the opposite hill before we reached the bottom of\r\nthe ravine. They found the pig which I had killed and a blood-splashed\r\ntrail leading around the hill where the boar had disappeared.\r\n\r\nMy pig was a splendid male in the rich red-brown coat of adolescence.\r\nThe bullet had struck him \"amid-ships\" and shattered the hip on the\r\nopposite side. From the blood on the trail we decided that I had shot\r\nthe big boar through the center of the body about ten inches behind the\r\nforelegs.\r\n\r\nWe had learned by experience how much killing a full-grown pig\r\nrequired, and had no illusions about finding him dead a few yards away,\r\neven though both sides of his path were blotched with red at every\r\nstep. Therefore, while the Chinese followed the trail, Smith and I\r\nsprinted across the next ridge into a thickly forested ravine to head\r\noff the boar.\r\n\r\nWe took stations several yards apart, and suddenly I heard Smith's\r\nrifle bang six times in quick succession. The Chinese had disturbed the\r\npig from a patch of cover and it had climbed the opposite hill slope in\r\nfull view of Smith, who apparently had missed it every time. Missing a\r\nboar dodging about among the bushes is not such a difficult thing to\r\ndo, and although poor Smith was too disgusted even to talk about it, I\r\nhad a good deal of sympathy for him.\r\n\r\nWe had little hope of getting the animal when we climbed to the summit\r\nof the ridge and saw the tangle of brush into which it had disappeared,\r\nbut nevertheless we followed the trail which was still showing blood.\r\nI was in front and was just letting myself down a snow-covered bowlder,\r\nwhen far below me I saw a huge sow and a young pig walking slowly\r\nthrough the trees. I turned quickly, lost my balance, and slipped feet\r\nfirst over the rock into a mass of thorns and scrub. A locomotive could\r\nnot have made more noise, and I extricated myself just in time to see\r\nthe two pigs disappear into a grove of pines. I was bleeding from a\r\ndozen scratches, but I climbed to the summit of the ridge and dashed\r\nforward hoping to cut them off if they crossed below me. They did\r\nnot appear, and we tried to drive them out from the cover into which\r\nthey had made their way; but we never saw them again. It was already\r\nbeginning to grow dark and too late to pick up the trail of the wounded\r\nboar, so we had to call it a day and return to the village.\r\n\r\nOne of our men carried my shotgun and we killed half a dozen pheasants\r\non the way back to camp. The birds had come into the open to feed, and\r\nsmall flocks were scattered along the valley every few hundred yards.\r\nWe saw about one hundred and fifty in less than an hour, besides a few\r\nchuckars.\r\n\r\nI have never visited any part of China where pheasants were so\r\nplentiful as in this region. Had we been hunting birds we could have\r\nkilled a hundred or more without the slightest difficulty during the\r\ntime we were looking for pigs. We could not shoot, however, without\r\nthe certainty of disturbing big game and, consequently, we only killed\r\npheasants when on the way back to camp. During the day the birds kept\r\nwell up toward the summits of the ridges and only left the cover in the\r\nmorning and evening.\r\n\r\nOur second hunt was very amusing, as well as successful. We met the\r\nsame party of Chinese hunters early in the morning, and agreed to\r\ndivide the meat of all the pigs we killed during the day if they would\r\njoin forces with us. Among them was a tall, fine-looking young fellow,\r\nevidently the leader, who was a real hunter--the only one we found in\r\nthe entire region. He knew instinctively where the pigs were, what they\r\nwould do, and how to get them.\r\n\r\nHe led us without a halt along the summit of the mountain into a ravine\r\nand up a long slope to the crest of a knifelike ridge. Then he suddenly\r\ndropped in the grass and pointed across a cañon to a bare hillside. Two\r\npigs were there in plain sight--one a very large sow. They were fully\r\nthree hundred yards away and on the edge of a bushy patch toward which\r\nthey were feeding slowly. Smith left me to hurry to the bottom of the\r\ncañon where he could have a shot at close range if either one went down\r\nthe hill, while I waited behind a stone. Before he was halfway down the\r\nslope the sow moved toward the patch of cover into which the smaller\r\npig had already disappeared. It must be then, if I was to have a shot\r\nat all. I fired rather hurriedly and registered a clean miss. Both\r\npigs, instead of staying in the cover where they would have been safe,\r\ndashed down the open slope toward the bottom of the cañon. At my first\r\nshot all eight of the Chinese had leaped for the empty rifle shell and\r\nwere rolling about like a pack of dogs after a bone. One of them struck\r\nmy leg just as I fired the second time and the bullet went into the\r\nair; I delivered a broadside of my choicest Chinese oaths and the man\r\ndrew off. I sent three shots after the fleeing sow, but she disappeared\r\nunhurt.\r\n\r\nOne shell remained in my rifle, and I saw the other pig running like a\r\nscared rabbit in the very bottom of the cañon. It was so far away that\r\nI could barely see the animal through my sights, but when I fired it\r\nturned a complete somersault and lay still; the bullet had caught it\r\nsquarely in the head.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Smith was having a lively time with the old sow. He had\r\nswung around a corner of rock just in time to meet the pig coming at\r\nfull speed from the other side not six yards away. He tried to check\r\nhimself, slipped, and sat down suddenly but managed to fire once,\r\nbreaking the animal's left foreleg. It disappeared into the brush with\r\nSmith after it.\r\n\r\nHe began an intermittent bombardment which lasted half an hour.\r\n_Bang, bang, bang_--then silence. _Bang, bang, bang_--silence again.\r\nI wondered what it all meant and finally ran down the bottom of the\r\nvalley until I saw Smith opposite to me just under the rim of the\r\nravine. He was tearing madly through the brush not far behind the\r\nsow. As the animal appeared for an instant on the summit of a rise he\r\ndropped on one knee and fired twice. Then I saw him race over the hill,\r\nleaping the bushes like a roebuck. Once he rolled ten feet into a mass\r\nof thorn scrub, but he was up again in an instant, hurdling the brush\r\nand fallen logs, his eye on the pig.\r\n\r\nIt was screamingly funny and I was helpless with laughter. \"Go it.\r\nSmith,\" I yelled. \"Run him down. Catch him in your hands.\" He had no\r\nbreath to waste in a reply, for just then he leaped a fallen log and\r\nI saw the sow charge him viciously. The animal had been lying under a\r\ntree, almost done, but still had life enough to damage Smith badly if\r\nit had reached him. As the man landed on his feet, he fired again at\r\nthe pig which was almost on him. The bullet caught the brute in the\r\nshoulder at the base of the neck and rolled it over, but it struggled\r\nto its feet and ran uncertainly a few steps; then it dropped in a\r\nlittle gully.\r\n\r\nBy the time I had begun to climb the hill Smith shouted that the pig\r\nmight charge again, and I kept my rifle ready, but the animal was \"all\r\nin.\" I circled warily and, creeping up from behind, drove my hunting\r\nknife into its heart; even then it struggled to get at me before it\r\nrolled over dead.\r\n\r\nSmith was streaming blood from a score of scratches, and his clothes\r\nwere in ribbons, but his face was radiant. \"I'd have chased the blasted\r\npig clear to Peking,\" he said. \"All my shells are gone, but I wasn't\r\ngoing to let him get away. If I hadn't kept that last cartridge he'd\r\nhave caught me, surely.\"\r\n\r\nIt was fine enthusiasm and, if ever a man deserved his game. Smith\r\ndeserved that sow. The animal had been shot in half a dozen places; two\r\nlegs were broken, and at least three of the bullets had reached vital\r\nspots. Still the brute kept on. Any one who thinks pigs are easy to\r\nkill ought to try the ones in Shansi! The sow weighed well over three\r\nhundred pounds, and it required six men to carry the two pigs into\r\ncamp. We got no more, although we saw two others, but still we felt\r\nthat the day had not been ill spent. As long as I live I shall never\r\nforget Smith's hurdle race after that old sow.\r\n\r\nAlthough I killed two roebuck, the next day I returned to camp with\r\nrage in my heart. Smith and I had separated late in the afternoon, and\r\nI was hunting with an old Chinese when we discovered three pigs--a huge\r\nboar, a sow, and a shote--crossing an open hill. Crawling on my face,\r\nI reached a rock not seventy yards from the animals. At the first shot\r\nthe boar pitched over the bluff into a tangle of thorns, squealing\r\nwildly. My second bullet broke the shoulder of the sow, and I had a mad\r\nchase through a patch of scrub, but finally lost her.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to get the big boar I discovered my Chinese squatted on\r\nhis haunches in the ravine. He blandly informed me that the pig could\r\nnot be found. I spent the half hour of remaining daylight burrowing in\r\nthe thorn scrub without success. I learned later that the native had\r\nconcealed the dead pig under a mass of stones and that during the night\r\nhe and his confreres had carried it away. Moreover, after we left, they\r\nalso got the sow which I had wounded. Although at the time I did not\r\nsuspect the man's perfidy, nevertheless it was apparent that he had not\r\nkept his eyes on the boar as I had told him to do; otherwise the pig\r\ncould not possibly have escaped.\r\n\r\nWe had one more day of hunting because Smith had obtained two\r\nweeks' leave. The next morning dawned dark and cloudy with spurts\r\nof hail--just the sort of weather in which animals prefer to stay\r\ncomfortably snuggled under a bush in the thickest cover. Consequently\r\nwe saw nothing all day except one roebuck, which I killed. It was\r\nrunning at full speed when I fired, and it disappeared over the crest\r\nof a hill without a sign of injury. Smith was waiting on the other\r\nside, and I wondered why he did not shoot, until we reached the summit\r\nand discovered the deer lying dead in the grass. Smith had seen the\r\nbuck plunge over the ridge, and just as he was about to fire, it\r\ncollapsed.\r\n\r\nWe found that my bullet had completely smashed the heart, yet the\r\nanimal had run more than one hundred yards. As it fell, one of its\r\nantlers had been knocked off and the other was so loose that it dropped\r\nin my hand when I lifted the head. This was on December 11. The other\r\nbucks which I had killed still wore their antlers, but probably they\r\nwould all have been shed before Christmas. The growth takes place\r\nduring the winter, and the velvet is all off the new antlers by the\r\nfollowing May.\r\n\r\nOn the way back to camp we saw a huge boar standing on an open\r\nhillside. Smith and I fired hurriedly and both missed a perfectly easy\r\nshot. With one of the Chinese I circled the ridge, while Smith took\r\nup the animal's trail. We arrived on the edge of a deep ravine just\r\nas the boar appeared in the very bottom. I fired as it rushed through\r\nthe bushes, and the pig squealed but never hesitated. The second shot\r\nstruck behind it, but at the third it squealed again and dived into a\r\npatch of cover. When we reached the spot we found a great pool of blood\r\nand bits of entrails--but no pig. A broad red patch led through the\r\nsnow, and we followed, expecting at every step to find the animal dead.\r\nInstead, the track carried us down the hill, up the bottom of a ravine,\r\nand onto a hill bare of snow but thickly covered with oak scrub.\r\n\r\nWhile Smith and I circled ahead to intercept the pig, the Chinese\r\nfollowed the trail. It was almost dark when we went back to the men,\r\nwho announced that the blood had ceased and that they had lost the\r\ntrack. It seemed incredible; but they had so trampled the trail where\r\nit left the snow that we could not find it again in the gloom.\r\n\r\nThen Smith and I suspected what we eventually found to be true,\r\nviz., that the men had discovered the dead pig and had purposely led\r\nus astray. We had no proof, however, and they denied the charge so\r\nviolently that we began to think our suspicions were unfounded.\r\n\r\nWe had to leave at daylight next morning in order to reach Peking\r\nbefore Smith's leave expired. Two days after we left, one of my friends\r\narrived at Kao-chia-chuang, where we had first hunted, and reported\r\nthat the Chinese had brought in all four of the pigs which we had\r\nwounded. One of them, probably the boar we lost on the last night,\r\nwas an enormous animal which the natives said weighed more than five\r\nhundred pounds. Of course, this could not have been true, but it\r\nprobably did reach nearly four hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nWhat Smith and I said when we learned that the scoundrels had cheated\r\nus would not look well in print. However, it taught us several things\r\nabout boar hunting which will prove of value in the future. The Chinese\r\ncan sell wild pig meat for a very high price since it is considered\r\nto be a great delicacy. Therefore, if I wound a pig in the future I\r\nshall, myself, follow its trail to the bitter end. Moreover, I learned\r\nthat, to knock over a wild boar and keep him down for good, one needs a\r\nheavy rifle. The bullet of my 6.5 mm. Mannlicher, which has proved to\r\nbe a wonderful killer for anything up to and including sheep, has not\r\nweight enough behind it to stop a pig in its tracks. These animals have\r\nsuch wonderful vitality that, even though shot in a vital spot, they\r\ncan travel an unbelievable distance. Next time I shall carry a rifle\r\nespecially designed for pigs and thieving Chinese!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT PARK OF THE EASTERN TOMBS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sunshine of an early spring day was flooding the flower-filled\r\ncourtyards of Duke Tsai Tse's palace in Peking when Dr. G. D. Wilder,\r\nEverett Smith, and I alighted from our car at the huge brass-hound\r\ngate. We came by motor instead of rickshaw, for we were on an official\r\nvisit which had been arranged by the American Minister. We would have\r\nsuffered much loss of \"face\" had we come in any lesser vehicle than\r\nan automobile, for we were to be received by a \"Royal Highness,\" an\r\nImperial Duke and a man in whose veins flowed the bluest of Manchu\r\nblood. Although living in retirement, Duke Tsai Tse is still a powerful\r\nand a respected man.\r\n\r\nWe were ushered through court after court into a large reception hall\r\nfurnished in semi-foreign style but in excellent taste. A few moments\r\nlater the duke entered, dressed in a simple gown of dark blue silk.\r\nHad I met him casually on the street I should have known he was a\r\n\"personality.\" His high-bred features were those of a maker of history,\r\nof a man who has faced the ruin of his own ambitions; who has seen his\r\nemperor deposed and his dynasty shattered; but who has lost not one\r\nwhit of his poise or self-esteem. He carried himself with a quiet\r\ndignity, and there was a royal courtesy in his greeting which inspired\r\nprofound respect. Had he been marked for death in the revolution I am\r\nsure that he would have received his executioners in the same calm way\r\nthat he met us in the reception hall. He listened with a courteous\r\ninterest while we explained the object of our visit. We had come, we\r\ntold him, to ask permission to collect natural history specimens in\r\nthe great hunting park at the _Tung Ling_, Eastern Tombs. Here, and at\r\nthe _Hsi Ling_, or Western Tombs, the Manchu emperors and their royal\r\nconsorts sleep in splendid mausoleums among the fragrant pines.\r\n\r\nThe emperors are buried at the lower end of a vast, walled park, more\r\nthan one hundred miles in length. True to their reverence for the dead,\r\nthe Chinese conquerors have never touched these sacred spots, and\r\ndoubtless will never do so. They belong unquestionably to the Manchus,\r\neven if their dynasty has been overthrown by force of arms. According\r\nto custom, some member of the royal court is always in residence at\r\nthe Eastern Tombs. This fact Tsai Tse gravely explained, and said that\r\nhe would commend us in a letter to Duke Chou, who would be glad to\r\ngrant us the privileges we asked. Then, by touching his teacup to his\r\nlips, he indicated that our interview was ended. With the same courtesy\r\nhe would have shown to a visiting diplomat he ushered us through the\r\ncourtyards, while at each doorway we begged him to return. Such is the\r\ncustom in China. That same afternoon a messenger from the duke arrived\r\nat my house in Wu Liang Tajen Hutung bearing a letter beautifully\r\nwritten in Chinese characters.\r\n\r\nEverett Smith and I left next morning for the Eastern Tombs. We went\r\nby train to Tung-cho, twelve miles away, where a _mafu_ was waiting\r\nwith our ponies and a cart for baggage. The way to the _Tung Ling_ is\r\na delight, for along it north China country life passes before one in\r\npanoramic completeness. For centuries this road has been an imperial\r\nhighway. I could imagine the gorgeous processions that had passed over\r\nit and the pomp and ceremony of the visits of the living emperors to\r\nthe resting places of the dead.\r\n\r\nMost vivid of all was the picture in my mind of the last great funeral\r\nonly nine years ago. I could see the imperial yellow bier slowly,\r\nsolemnly, borne over the gray Peking hills. In it lay the dead body\r\nof the Dowager Empress, Tz'u-hsi--most dreaded yet most beloved--the\r\ngreatest empress of the last century, the woman who tasted of life and\r\npower through the sweetest joys to their bitter core.\r\n\r\nWe spent the first night at an inn on the outskirts of a tiny village.\r\nIt was a clean inn, too--very different from those in south China. The\r\ngreat courtyard was crowded with arriving carts. In the kitchen dozens\r\nof tired _mafus_ were noisily gulping huge bowls of macaroni, and\r\nothers, stretched upon the _kang_, had already become mere, shapeless\r\nbundles of dirty rags. After dinner Smith and I wandered outside the\r\ncourt. An open-air theater was in full operation a few yards from the\r\ninn, and all the village had gathered in the street. But we were of\r\nmore interest to the audience than the drama itself, and in an instant\r\na score of men and women had surrounded us. They were all good-natured\r\nbut frankly curious. Finally an old man joined the crowd. \"Why,\" said\r\nhe, \"there are two foreigners!\" Immediately the hum of voices ceased,\r\nfor Age was speaking. \"They've got foreign clothes,\" he exclaimed; \"and\r\nwhat funny hats! It is true that foreign hats are much bigger than\r\nChinese caps, and they cost a lot more, too! See that gun the tall\r\none is carrying! He could shoot those pigeons over there as easily as\r\nnot--all of them with one shot--probably he will in a minute.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man continued the lecture until we strolled back to the inn.\r\nUndoubtedly he is still discussing us, for there is little to talk\r\nabout in a Chinese village, except crops and weather and local gossip.\r\n\r\nWe reached the Eastern Tombs in the late afternoon of the same day.\r\nEmerging from a rocky gateway on the summit of a hill, we had the whole\r\npanorama of the _Tung Ling_ spread out before us. It was like a vast\r\ngreen sea where wave after wave of splendid forests rolled away to the\r\nblue haze of distant mountains.\r\n\r\nThe islands in this forest-ocean were the yellow-roofed tombs, which\r\ngave back the sun in a thousand points of golden light. After the\r\nmonotonous brown of the bare north China hills, the vivid green of the\r\ntrees was as refreshing as finding an unknown oasis in a sandy desert.\r\nTo the right was the picturesque village of Ma-lin-yü, the residence of\r\nDuke Chou.\r\n\r\nFrom the wide veranda of the charming temple which we were invited\r\nto occupy we could look across the brown village to the splendid park\r\nand the glistening yellow roofs of the imperial tombs. We found next\r\nday that it is a veritable paradise, a spot of exquisite beauty where\r\nprofound artistic sentiment has been magnificently expressed. Broad,\r\npaved avenues, bordered by colossal animals sculptured in snow-white\r\nmarble, lead through the trees to imposing gates of red and gold.\r\nThere is, too, a delightful appreciation of climax. As one walks up a\r\nspacious avenue, passing through gate after gate, each more magnificent\r\nthan the last, one is being prepared by this cumulative splendor for\r\nthe tomb itself. One feels everywhere the dignity of space. There is no\r\nsmallness, no crowding. One feels the greatness of the people that has\r\ndone these things: a race that looks at life and death with a vision as\r\nbroad as the skies themselves.\r\n\r\nAt the _Tung Ling_ Nature has worked hand in hand with man to produce a\r\nharmonious whole. Most of the trees about the tombs have been planted,\r\nbut the work has been cleverly done. There is nothing glaringly\r\nartificial, and you feel as though you were in a well-groomed forest\r\nwhere every tree has grown just where, in Nature's scheme of things, it\r\nought to be.\r\n\r\nAlthough the tombs are alike in general plan, they are, at the same\r\ntime, as individual as were the emperors themselves. Each is a subtle\r\nexpression of the character of the one who sleeps beneath the yellow\r\nroof. The tomb of Ch'ien-Lung, the artist emperor, lies not far\r\naway from that of the Empress Dowager. Stately, beautiful in its\r\nsimplicity, it is an indication of his life and deeds. In striking\r\ncontrast is the palace built by the Empress for her eternal dwelling.\r\nA woman of iron will, holding her place by force and intrigue, a lover\r\nof lavish display--she has expressed it all in her gorgeous tomb. The\r\nextravagance of its decoration and the wealth of gold and silver seem\r\nto declare to all the world her desire to be known even in death as\r\nthe greatest of the great. It is said that her tomb cost ten million\r\ndollars, and I can well believe it. But a hundred years from now, when\r\nCh'ien-Lung's mausoleum, like the painting of an old master, has grown\r\neven more beautiful by the touch of age, that of the Empress will be\r\nworn and tarnished.\r\n\r\nCharmed with the calm, the peace, the exquisite beauty of the spot,\r\nwe spent a delightful day wandering among the red and gold pavilions.\r\nBut fascinating as were the tombs, we were really concerned with the\r\n\"hinterland,\" the hunting park itself. Sixty miles to the north, but\r\nstill within the walls, are towering mountains and glorious forests;\r\nthese were what we had come to see.\r\n\r\nAll day, behind three tiny donkeys, we followed a tortuous, foaming\r\nstream in the bottom of a splendid valley, ever going upward. At night\r\nwe slept in the open, and next day crossed the mountain into a forest\r\nof oak and pine sprinkled with silver birches. Hundreds of wood-cutters\r\npassed us on the trail, each carrying a single log upon his back.\r\nBefore we reached the village of Shing Lung-shan we came into an area\r\nof desolation. Thousands of splendid trees were lying in a chaos of\r\ncharred and blackened trunks. It was the wantonness of it all that\r\ndepressed and horrified me.\r\n\r\nThe reason was perfectly apparent. On every bit of open ground Manchu\r\nfarmers were at work with plow and hoe. The land was being cleared\r\nfor cultivation, regardless of all else. North China has very little\r\ntimber--so little, in fact, that one longs passionately to get away\r\nfrom the bare hills. Yet in this forest-paradise the trees were being\r\nsacrificed relentlessly simply to obtain a few more acres on which the\r\nfarmer could grow his crops. If it had to be done--and Heaven knows it\r\nneed not have been--the trees might have been utilized for timber. Many\r\nhave been cut, of course, but thousands upon thousands have been burned\r\nsimply to clear the hillside.\r\n\r\nAt Shing Lung-shan we met our hunters and continued up the valley for\r\nthree hours. With every mile there were fewer open spaces; we had come\r\nto a region of vast mountains, gloomy valleys, and heavy forests. The\r\nscenery was superb! It thrilled me as did the mountains of Yün-nan\r\nand the gorges of the Yangtze. Yet all this grandeur is less than one\r\nhundred miles from Peking!\r\n\r\nOn a little ridge between two foaming streams we made our camp in the\r\nforest. From the door of the tent we could look over the tops of the\r\ntrees into the blue distance of the valley; behind us was a wall of\r\nforests broken only by the winding corridor of the mountain torrent.\r\n\r\nWe had come to the _Tung Ling_ especially to obtain specimens of the\r\nsika deer (_Cervus hortulorum_) and the Reeves's pheasant (_Syrmaticus\r\nreevesi_). The former, a noble animal about the size of our Virginia\r\ndeer in America, has become exceedingly rare in north China. The\r\nlatter, one of the most beautiful of living birds, is found now in only\r\ntwo localities--near Ichang on the Yangtze River, and at the _Tung\r\nLing_. When the forests of the Eastern Tombs have been cleared this\r\nspecies will be extinct in all north China.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning we left with six hunters. Our way led up the\r\nbottom of the valley toward a mountain ridge north of camp. As we\r\nwalked along the trail, suddenly one of the hunters caught me by the\r\narm and whispered, \"_Sang-chi_\" (wild chicken). There was a whir\r\nof wings, a flash of gold--and I registered a clean miss! The bird\r\nalighted on the mountain side, and in the bliss of ignorance Smith and\r\nI dashed after it. Ten minutes later we were exhausted from the climb\r\nand the pheasant had disappeared. We learned soon that it is useless to\r\nchase a Reeves's pheasant when it has once been flushed, for it will\r\ninvariably make for a mountain side, run rapidly to the top, and, once\r\nover the summit, fly to another ridge.\r\n\r\nOn the way home I got my first pheasant, and an hour later put up half\r\na dozen. I should have had two more, but instead of shooting I only\r\nstared, fascinated by the beauty of the thing I saw. It was late in the\r\nafternoon and the sun was drawing oblique paths of shimmering golden\r\nlight among the trees. In a clearing near the summit of a wooded\r\nshoulder I saw six pheasants feeding and I realized that, by skirting\r\nthe base of the ridge, I could slip up from behind and force them to\r\nfly across the open valley. The stalk progressed according to schedule.\r\nWhen I crossed the ridge there was a whir of wings and six birds shot\r\ninto the air not thirty feet away. The sun, glancing on their yellow\r\nbacks and streaming plumes, transformed them into golden balls, each\r\none with a comet-trail of living fire.\r\n\r\nThe picture was so indescribably beautiful that I watched them sail\r\nacross the valley with the gun idle in my hands. Not for worlds would I\r\nhave turned one of those glorious birds into a crumpled mass of flesh\r\nand feathers. For centuries the barred tail plumes, which sometimes are\r\nsix feet long, have been worn by Chinese actors, and the bird is famous\r\nin their literature. It will be a real tragedy when this species has\r\npassed out of the fauna of north China, as it will do inevitably if the\r\nwanton destruction of the _Tung Ling_ forests is continued unchecked.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon four sika deer gave me a hard chase up and down\r\nthree mountain ridges. Finally, we located the animals in a deep\r\nvalley, and I had an opportunity to examine them through my glasses.\r\nMuch to my disgust I saw that the velvet was not yet off the antlers\r\nand that their winter coats were only partly shed. They were valueless\r\nas specimens and forthwith I abandoned the hunt. Before leaving Peking\r\nI had visited the zoölogical garden to make sure that the captive sika\r\nhad assumed their summer dress and antlers. But at the _Tung Ling_,\r\nspring had not yet arrived, and the animals were late in losing their\r\nwinter hair.\r\n\r\nIn summer the sika is the most beautiful of all deer. Its bright red\r\nbody, spotted with white, is, when seen among the green leaves of the\r\nforest, one of the loveliest things in nature. We wished to obtain a\r\ngroup of these splendid animals for the new Hall of Asiatic Life in\r\nthe American Museum of Natural History, but the specimens had to be in\r\nperfect summer dress.\r\n\r\nMy hunter was disgusted beyond expression when I refused to shoot\r\nthe deer. The antlers of the sika when in the velvet are of greater\r\nvalue to the natives than those of any other species. A good pair of\r\nhorns in full velvet sometimes sells for as much as $450. The growing\r\nantlers are called _shueh-chiao_ (blood horns) by the Chinese, who\r\nconsider them of the highest efficacy as a remedy for certain diseases.\r\nTherefore, the animals are persecuted relentlessly and very few remain\r\neven in the _Tung Ling_.\r\n\r\nThe antlers of the wapiti are also of great value to the native\r\ndruggists, but strangely enough they care little for those of the moose\r\nand the roebuck. Hundreds of thousand of deerhorns are sent from the\r\ninterior provinces of China to be sold in the large cities, and the\r\ncomplete extermination of certain species is only a matter of a few\r\ndecades. Moreover, the female elk, just before the calving season,\r\nreceive unmerciful persecution, for it is believed that the unborn\r\nfawns have great medicinal properties.\r\n\r\nSince the roebuck at the _Tung Ling_ were in the same condition as the\r\nsika, they were useless for our purposes. The goral, however, which\r\nlive high up on the rocky peaks, had not begun to shed their hair,\r\nand they gave us good shooting. One beautiful morning Smith killed a\r\nsplendid ram just above our camp. We had often looked at a ragged,\r\ngranite outcrop, sparsely covered with spruce and pine trees, which\r\ntowered a thousand feet above us. We were sure there must be goral\r\nsomewhere on the ridge, and the hunters told us that they had sometimes\r\nkilled them there. It was a stiff climb, and we were glad to rest when\r\nwe reached the summit. The old hunter placed Smith opposite an almost\r\nperpendicular face of rock and stationed me beyond him on the other\r\nside. Three beaters had climbed the mountain a mile below us and were\r\ndriving up the ridge.\r\n\r\nFor half an hour I lay stretched out in the sun luxuriating in the\r\nwarmth and breathing in the fragrant odor of the pines. While I was\r\nlazily watching a Chinese green woodpecker searching for grubs in a\r\ntree near by, there came the faintest sound of a loosened pebble on the\r\ncliff above my head. Instantly I was alert and tense. A second later\r\nSmith's rifle banged once. Then all was still.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments he shouted to me that he had fired at a big goral, but\r\nthat it had disappeared behind the ridge and he was afraid' it had not\r\nbeen hit. The old hunter, however, had seen the animal scramble into a\r\ntiny grove of pine trees. As it had not emerged, I was sure the goral\r\nwas wounded, and when the men climbed up the cliff they found it dead,\r\nbored neatly through the center of the chest.\r\n\r\nGorals, sika, and roebuck are by no means the only big game animals in\r\nthe _Tung Ling_. Bears and leopards are not uncommon, and occasionally\r\na tiger is killed by the natives. Among other species is a huge flying\r\nsquirrel, nearly three feet long, badgers, and chipmunks, a beautiful\r\nsquirrel with tufted ears which is almost black in summer and now is\r\nvery rare, and dozens of small animals. But perhaps most interesting of\r\nall the creatures of these noble forests are the only wild monkeys to\r\nbe found in northeastern China.\r\n\r\nThe birds are remarkable in variety and numbers. Besides the Reeves's\r\npheasant, of which I have spoken, there are two other species of this\r\nmost beautiful family. One, the common ring-necked pheasant, is very\r\nabundant; the other is the rare Pucrasia, a gray bird with a dark-red\r\nbreast, and a yellow striped head surmounted by a conspicuous crest. It\r\nis purely a mountain form requiring a mixed forest of pine and oak and,\r\nalthough more widely distributed than the Reeves's pheasant, it occurs\r\nin comparatively few localities of north China.\r\n\r\nOne morning as Smith and I were coming back from hunting we saw our\r\nthree boys perched upon a ledge above the stream peering into the\r\nwater. They called to us, \"Would you like some fish?\" \"Of course,\" we\r\nanswered, \"but how can you get them?\"\r\n\r\nIn a second they had slipped from the rock and were stripping off their\r\nclothes. Then one went to the shallows at the lower end of the pool\r\nand began to beat the surface with a leafy branch, while the other\r\ntwo crouched on the bowlders in midstream. Suddenly, one of the boys\r\nplunged his head and arms into the water and emerged with a beautiful\r\nspeckled trout clutched tightly in both hands. He had seen the fish\r\nswim beneath the rock where it was cornered and had caught it before it\r\ncould escape.\r\n\r\nFor an hour the two boys sat like kingfishers, absolutely motionless\r\nexcept when they dived into the water. Of course, they often missed;\r\nbut when we were ready to go home they had eight beautiful trout,\r\nseveral of them weighing as much as two pounds. The stream was full of\r\nfish, and we would have given worlds for a rod and flies.\r\n\r\nLü baked a loaf of com bread in his curious little oven made from a\r\nStandard Oil tin, and we found a jar of honey in our stores. Brook\r\ntrout fried in deep bacon fat, regular \"southern style\" corn bread and\r\nhoney, apple pie, coffee, and cigarettes--the \"hardships of camping in\r\nthe Orient!\"\r\n\r\nWhen we had been in camp a week we awoke one morning to find a heavy\r\ncloud of smoke drifting up the valley. Evidently a tremendous fire was\r\nraging, and Smith and I set out at once on a tour of investigation.\r\nA mile down the valley we saw the whole mountain side ablaze. It was\r\na beautiful sight, I admit, but the destruction of that magnificent\r\nforest appalled us. Fortunately, the wind was blowing strongly from\r\nthe east, and there was no danger that the fire might sweep northward\r\nin the direction of our camp. As we emerged into a tiny clearing,\r\noccupied by a single log hut, we saw two Chinese sitting on their\r\nheels, placidly watching the roaring furnace across the valley.\r\n\r\nWith a good deal of excitement we asked them how the fire possibly\r\ncould have originated.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said one, \"we started it ourselves.\" \"In the name of the five\r\ngods why did you do it?\" Smith asked. \"Well, you see,\" returned the\r\nChinese, \"there was quite a lot of brush here in our clearing and we\r\nhad to get rid of it. To-day the wind was right, so we set it on fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"But don't you see that you have burned up that whole mountain's side,\r\ndestroyed thousands of trees, and absolutely ruined this end of the\r\nvalley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, but never mind; it can't be helped,\" the native answered.\r\nThen I exploded. I frankly confess that I cursed that Chinese and\r\nall his ancestors; which is the only proper way to curse in China.\r\nI assured him that he was an \"old rabbit\" and that his father and\r\nhis grandfather and his great-grandfather were rabbits. To tell a\r\nman that he is even remotely connected with a rabbit is decidedly\r\nuncomplimentary in China.\r\n\r\nBut when it was all said I had accomplished nothing. The man looked\r\nat me in blank amazement as though I had suddenly lost my mind. He\r\nhad not the faintest idea that burning up that beautiful forest was\r\nreprehensible in the slightest degree. To him and all his kind, the\r\nonly thing worth while was to clear that bit of land in the valley.\r\nIf every tree on the mountain was destroyed in the process, what\r\ndifference did it make? It would be done eventually, anyway. Land,\r\nwhether it be on a hill or in a valley, was made to grow crops and to\r\nbe cultivated by Chinese farmers.\r\n\r\nThe wanton destruction which is being wrought at the _Tung Ling_ makes\r\nme sick at heart. Here is one of the most beautiful spots in all China,\r\nwithin less than one hundred miles of Peking, which is being ruined\r\nutterly as fast as ax and fire can do the work. One can travel the\r\nlength and breadth of the whole Republic and not find elsewhere so\r\nmuch glorious scenery in so small a space. Moreover, it is the last\r\nsanctuary of much of north China's wild life. When the forests of the\r\n_Tung Ling_ are gone, half a dozen species of birds and mammals will\r\nbecome extinct. How much of the original flora of north China exists\r\nto-day only in these forests I would not dare say, for I am not a\r\nbotanist, but it can be hardly less than the fauna of which I know.\r\n\r\nIf China could but realize before it is too late how priceless a\r\ntreasure is being hewed and burned to nothingness and take the first\r\nstep in conservation by making a National Park of the Eastern Tombs!\r\n\r\nPolitically there are difficulties, it is true. The _Tung Ling_, and\r\nall the surroundings, as I have said, belong unquestionably to the\r\nManchus, and they can do as they wish with their own. But it is largely\r\na question of money, and were the Republic to pay the price for the\r\nforests and mountains beyond the Tombs it would not be difficult to\r\ndo the rest. No country on earth ever had a more splendid opportunity\r\nto create for the generations of the present and the future a living\r\nmemorial to its glorious past.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aëroplanes, 182\r\n  Altai Mountains, 182\r\n  American Museum of Natural History, Asiatic Explorations of, vii;\r\n    trustees of, viii, ix.\r\n  Anderson, Dr. J.
