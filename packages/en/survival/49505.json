The\r\nancient gem cutters probably used spheres of glass filled with water as\r\nmagnifiers, their work could hardly have been accomplished without some\r\nartificial aid. We know, from early writings, that burning glasses were\r\nused by physicians in their work, and Seneca, the author, who wrote in\r\nA.D. 63, says: “Letters, however small and dim, are comparatively large\r\nand distinct when seen through a glass globe filled with water.”\r\n\r\nEuclid, whose name at least is familiar to everyone, was, as shown\r\nby his writings, perfectly well acquainted with the fact that curved\r\nmirrors may be used to magnify objects, and that was so long ago as\r\nthe third century B.C. Convex glasses, used as spectacles, were first\r\nmentioned by Bernard de Gordon, about 1307, but, as far as we know,\r\nthey were never used for the purpose of studying minute living objects.\r\n\r\nTo Leonardo da Vinci belongs the honour of seriously investigating,\r\nfor the first time, the properties of concave and convex lenses,\r\nand several alchemists, as the early chemists were called, used\r\nflasks filled with water, concave mirrors or glass balls to gather\r\ntogether the rays of the sun. “Long before the dawn of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, the principle of the lens was both comprehended and applied\r\nto scientific matters by the Englishmen, Leonard Digges and his son\r\nThomas, and by the Italian, Giambattista Porta.”\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the sixteenth century and the early part of the\r\nseventeenth century, interest in the minute structure of natural\r\nobjects appears to have developed. As early as 1590, Thomas Mouffet\r\nused magnifying glasses in studying small mites, and in 1637 Descartes\r\ninvented a single lens microscope in which the rays of light were\r\nreflected on to the object by means of a concave mirror. This method of\r\nillumination, it is interesting to note, is still used in some forms of\r\npocket magnifiers. Most of the early discoveries were made with single\r\nlenses, for in the compound microscopes which were first made, it was\r\nonly possible to view such a small portion of an object at one time\r\nthat the advantage lay with the less complicated instrument.\r\n\r\nThe earliest microscopes were simply short tubes of any material which\r\nwould not admit light; at one end there was a lens, at the other a\r\nglass plate on which the object to be examined was placed. Because\r\nthese crude instruments were chiefly used for the examination of\r\ninsects they were known as “Vitrea pulicaria” or “Vitrea muscaria.”\r\nLater they were called “Engyoscopes,” and, after the invention of\r\ncompound microscopes, they were described as “Microscopia ludicra,” as\r\nopposed to the latter instruments, known as “Microscopia seria.”\r\n\r\nThe next stage in the development of the microscope consisted in the\r\nintroduction of lenses of very short focal length, and, in 1665, Robert\r\nHooke used small glass balls, formed by fusing threads of drawn glass,\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\nIt was Antony van Leeuwenhoek, however, who perfected these\r\ninstruments. He brought an extraordinary skill and industry to bear\r\non the grinding and polishing of minute lenses of short focal length.\r\nAlready in 1673 Regnier de Graaf wrote to the Royal Society in London\r\nthat Leeuwenhoek was making glasses far superior to those of the great\r\nItalian lens maker, Eustachio Divini. Leeuwenhoek’s success was largely\r\ndue not only to his method of grinding, but also to the skill with\r\nwhich he mounted his lenses, which were accurately fitted into a minute\r\nhole in a metal plate. The object to be examined was firmly held in a\r\nstand and adjusted by means of a screw movement. By this means, and by\r\nthe use of hollow metal reflectors, he succeeded in availing himself\r\nof transmitted light in the case of transparent objects. Leeuwenhoek\r\nwas able to make immense advances with these instruments, the minute\r\npond animals he could see with ease, and by 1683 he had even attained a\r\nsight of the bacteria. His researches represented the high-water mark\r\nof work done with the simple microscope, most of the later work was\r\ncarried out with the compound instrument.\r\n\r\nThe earliest history of the compound microscope is difficult to\r\nseparate from that of the telescope and, in any complete account, the\r\ntwo instruments must be considered together. It appears that the first\r\nscientist that conceived the idea of using a series of lenses, rather\r\nthan a single lens, was Leonard Digges, whom we have already mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn a book by Porta, a writer who though not himself original, was\r\ngifted with great curiosity and industry in the collection of the ideas\r\nof others, we read: “How to make plain a letter held far away by means\r\nof a lens of crystal,” and also that “with a concave lens you see\r\nthings afar smaller but plainer, with a convex lens you see them larger\r\nbut less distinct. If, however, you know how to combine the two sorts\r\nproperly you will see near and far both large and clear.”\r\n\r\nShortly after the publication of Porta’s book the method of combining\r\ntwo lenses into a microscope or telescope was discovered, quite\r\naccidentally, by a Dutch boy named Zacharias, who worked in the shop\r\nof his father, a spectacle maker. The event was described by Willem\r\nBoreel, Dutch Ambassador to France, in a letter written in 1655. He\r\nwrote: “I am a native of Middleburg, the capital of Zeeland, and close\r\nto the house where I was born, there lived in the year 1591 a certain\r\nspectacle maker, Hans by name. His wife, Maria, had a son, Zacharias,\r\nwhom I knew very well, because I constantly as a neighbour and from\r\na tender age went in and out playing with him. This Hans or Johannes\r\nwith his son Zacharias, as I have often heard, were the first to invent\r\nmicroscopes, which they presented to Prince Maurice, the governor and\r\nsupreme commander of the United Dutch forces, and were rewarded with\r\nsome honorarium. Similarly they afterwards offered a microscope to\r\nthe Austrian Archduke Albert, supreme governor of Holland. When I was\r\nAmbassador to England in the year 1619, the Dutchman Cornelius Drebbel\r\nof Alkomar, a man familiar with many secrets of nature, who was serving\r\nthere as a mathematician to King James, and was well known to me,\r\nshowed me that very instrument which the Archduke had presented as a\r\ngift to Drebbel, namely, the microscope of Zacharias himself. Nor was\r\nit (as they are most seen) with a short tube, but nearly two and a half\r\nfeet long, and the tube was of gilded brass two fingers’ breadth in\r\ndiameter, and supported on three dolphins formed also of brass. At its\r\nbase was an ebony disc, containing shreds or some minute objects which\r\nwe inspected from above, and their forms were so magnified as to seem\r\nalmost miraculous.” So this was the first compound microscope!\r\n\r\nAlthough Zacharias invented the microscope, it was Galileo who\r\nintroduced it to the scientific world. He published a book in 1610\r\nin which he wrote: “About ten months ago a rumour reached me of an\r\nocular instrument made by a certain Dutchman, by means of which an\r\nobject could be made to appear distinct and near to an eye that looked\r\nthrough it, although it was really far away. And so I considered the\r\ndesirability of investigating the method, and reflected on the means by\r\nwhich I might come to the invention of a similar instrument. I first\r\nprepared a leather tube at the ends of which one placed two lenses\r\neach of them flat on one side, and as to the other side I fashioned\r\none concave and the other convex. Then holding the eye to the concave\r\none, I saw the objects fairly large and nearer, for they appeared three\r\ntimes nearer and nine times larger than when they were observed by\r\nthe naked eye. Soon after I made another more exactly, representing\r\nobjects more than sixty times larger. At length, sparing no labour and\r\nno expense, I got to the point that I could construct an excellent\r\ninstrument so that things seen through it appeared a thousand times\r\ngreater and more than thirty-fold nearer than if observed by the\r\nnaked eye.” Galileo had his enemies, who accused him of having picked\r\nZacharias’s brains; he admitted that he had taken his idea from the\r\nDutchman’s invention, but further than that he would not go; in fact,\r\nhe replied that the invention of Zacharias was a mere accident but that\r\nhis own instrument was discovered by a process of reasoning.\r\n\r\nIt would serve no good purpose to tell the story of all the scientists\r\nwho have helped to bring the microscope to its present state of\r\nperfection, although many of their descriptions of objects and\r\napparatus are as quaint as the latter. Scheiner, for example, who wrote\r\nin 1630, mentions “that wonderful instrument the microscope, by means\r\nof which a fly is magnified into an elephant, and a flea into a camel.”\r\nTo Kircher belongs the credit of being the first worker to construct\r\nan instrument with coarse and fine adjustment and with a substage\r\ncondenser, which could be used either for concentrating the sun’s rays\r\nor those from a lamp. With an instrument of this pattern Malpighi saw\r\nthe circulation of blood in a frog’s lung. By 1685, when instruments\r\nwith four and six lenses were being used, the compound microscope was\r\nfirmly established as a help to scientists, and the simple lens was\r\nused thereafter as an adjunct but not a rival to the newer instrument.\r\n\r\nHistory makes a strong appeal to many people, and those who are\r\nfascinated thereby will find endless amusement in reading old books on\r\nthe microscope and its objects. In the preface to Mouffet’s _Insectorum\r\nTheatrum_, one of the earliest books on insects, we read the following\r\nquaint lines: “If you will take lenticular object glasses of Crystal\r\n(for though you have Lynx his eyes, they are necessary in searching\r\nfor atoms) you will admire to see the Fleas that are curasheers, and\r\ntheir hollow trunk to torture men, which is a bitter plague to maids,\r\nyou shall see the eyes of Lice sticking forth, and their horns, their\r\nbodies crammed all over, their whole substance diaphanous, and through\r\nthat, the motion of their heart and blood. Also little Handworms, which\r\nare indivisible, they are so small, being with a needle prickt forth\r\nfrom their trenches near the pool of water which they have made in the\r\nskin, and being laid upon one’s nail, will discover by the sunlight\r\ntheir red heads and feet they creep withal.” The creatures called\r\nHandworms are itch mites, which tunnel in the human skin.\r\n\r\nIn our chapter on Nature Study and the Microscope we refer to the brown\r\npatches to be found on the backs of fern fronds; it is interesting to\r\nnote that so long ago as 1646 Sir Thomas Browne had quite a good idea\r\nof their structure. Describing them, he said: “Whether these little\r\ndusty particles, upon the lower side of the leaves be seeds we have\r\nnot yet been able to determine by any germination. But, by the help\r\nof magnifying glasses we find these dusty atoms to be round at first\r\nand fully representing seeds out of which at last proceed little\r\nmites, almost invisible, so that such as are old stand open, as being\r\nemptied of some bodies firstly included, which though discernible in\r\nHartstongue, is more notoriously discoverable, in some differences, of\r\nBrake or Fern.”\r\n\r\nTwo years earlier a noted scientist, Hodierna, had made a special study\r\nof the eyes of insects and, considering the crude instruments with\r\nwhich he must have worked, his descriptions are wonderfully accurate.\r\nOf the house fly he wrote: “The head is all eyes, prominent and without\r\nlids, lashes or brows. It is plumed with hairs like that of an ostrich\r\nand has two little pear shaped bodies hanging from the middle of the\r\nforehead. The proboscis which arises from the snout can be extended\r\nfreely and stretched forth to suck up humours and can afterwards\r\nbe directed back through the mouth and taken into the gullet. This\r\ninstinct nature has given the creature according to its need, for it is\r\nwithout a neck and cannot stretch forth its head to obtain its food,\r\nas is also the case with the elephant.” The author’s knowledge of the\r\nhouse fly was evidently greater than his knowledge of the ostrich,\r\nfor the bird has anything but a plumed head. The eye of the insect he\r\ncompares to a white mulberry.\r\n\r\nAnother of these early workers, writing about the same time, gives\r\na concise account of cheese mites, heading his description “On the\r\ncreatures which arise in powdery cheese,” he wrote: “The powder\r\nexamined by means of this instrument (the Compound Microscope) does not\r\npresent the aspect of dirt, but teems with animalcula. It can be seen\r\nthat these creatures have claws and talons and are furnished with eyes.\r\nThe whole surface of their body is beautifully and distinctly coloured\r\nin such sort as I have never seen before, and which indeed, cannot be\r\nseen without wonder. They may be observed to crawl, eat and work and\r\nare equal in apparent size to a man’s nail. Their backs are all spiny\r\nand pricked out with various starlike markings and surrounded by a\r\nrampart of hairs, all of such marvellous kind that you would say they\r\nare a work of art rather than of nature.”\r\n\r\nAt about this period the microscope was used for the first time for\r\nmedical work and, as far as can be ascertained, Pierre Borel was the\r\nfirst to use it for this purpose, and he learned a great deal about the\r\nstructure of flesh and the appearance of blood.\r\n\r\nOf all the early writers on microscopy the man who spread abroad his\r\nknowledge of the instrument and its capabilities, more than anyone\r\nelse, was Kircher, who died in 1680. He was an energetic writer, and\r\nwrote on a large number of subjects. His books dealt with magnetism,\r\ndesigns for a calculating machine, light, sound, history of plague,\r\nthe philosopher’s stone, Egyptian antiquities, a history of China and\r\na grammar. To all who read his book on the plague, it is clear that\r\nhe had a good idea of infection; he was, in fact, the first writer\r\nwho suspected it, though the microscope he used could not show him\r\nbacteria. In his book he wrote: “Everyone knows that decomposing bodies\r\nbreed worms, but only since the wonderful discovery of the microscope\r\nhas it been known that every putrid body swarms with innumerable\r\nvermicules, a statement which I should not have believed had I not\r\ntested its truth by experiments during many years.” The experiments he\r\nperformed to prove his statement are so quaint that we give them in his\r\nown words.\r\n\r\n_Experiment I._--“Take a piece of meat which you have exposed by\r\nnight until the following dawn to the lunar moisture. Then examine\r\nit carefully with the smicroscope and you will find the contracted\r\nputridity to have been altered by the moon into innumerable wormlets\r\nof diverse size, which, however, would escape the sharpness of vision\r\nwithout a good smicroscope. The same is true of cheese, milk, vinegar\r\nand similar bodies of a putrifiable nature. The smicroscope, however,\r\nmust be no ordinary one, but constructed with no less skill than\r\ndiligence, as is mine which represents objects one thousand times\r\ngreater than their true size.”\r\n\r\n_Experiment II._--“If you cut up a snake into small parts and macerate\r\nwith rain water, and then expose it for several days to the sun and\r\nagain bury it under the earth for a whole day and night and lastly\r\nexamine the parts, separated and softened by putridity, by means of a\r\nsmicroscope you will find the whole mass swarm with innumerable little\r\nmultiplying serpents so that even the sharpest eyes cannot count them.”\r\n\r\n_Experiment III._--“Many authors claim that unwashed sage is injurious,\r\nbut I have discovered the cause of this. For when, by means of the\r\nsun, I minutely examined the nature of the plant, I found the back of\r\nthe leaves completely covered by raised work as with the figure of a\r\nspider’s web, and within the water appeared infinitesimal animalcules,\r\nwhich moving constantly came out of little buds or eggs.”\r\n\r\n_Experiment IV._--“If you examine a particle of rotten wood under the\r\nsun, you will see an immense progeny of tiny worms, some with horns,\r\nsome with wings, others with many feet. They have little black dots of\r\neyes. What must their little livers and stomachs be like?”\r\n\r\nIn the light of modern discovery much of the writing of these early\r\nmicroscopists seems absurd. Kircher’s experiments, for example, prove\r\nnothing, and he is often hopelessly vague and sometimes incorrect in\r\nhis statements. We must not be too critical, however, for some of this\r\nearly work was excellent, the microscopes in use would not be tolerated\r\nat the present day, and without these pioneers microscopy would not\r\nhave reached the stage it has. Rather than laugh at their efforts, we\r\nshould marvel that they did so well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSOME EARLY MICROSCOPISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the early British microscopists, Robert Hooke must not pass\r\nunnoticed. He was appointed Curator of the Royal Society two years\r\nafter its formation, and the terms of his appointment were somewhat\r\none-sided. He was required to “furnish the Society every day they meet\r\nwith three or four experiments”; for this no pay was to be his till the\r\nSociety accumulated sufficient funds to reward him.\r\n\r\nAlthough compound microscopes had been invented in Hooke’s day, it is\r\nnoteworthy that he remained faithful to the single lens, in fact it was\r\nnot till very many years later that the simple lens was supplanted, in\r\ngeneral use by the more complicated, if more perfect instrument.\r\n\r\nIn his book on Microscopy, entitled _Micrographia_, Hooke gives\r\na quaint account of the making of a microscope. “Could we make a\r\nmicroscope,” he writes, “to have only one refraction, it would _cæteris\r\nparibus_, far excel any other that had a greater number. And hence it\r\nis, that if you take a very clear piece of a broken Venice glass, and\r\nin a Lamp draw it out into very small hairs or threads, then holding\r\nthe ends of these threads in the flame, till they melt and run into a\r\nsmall round Globul, or drop, which will hang at the end of the thread;\r\nand if further you stick several of these upon the end of a stick with\r\na little sealing wax, so that the threads stand upwards, and then on\r\na whetstone first grind off a good part of them, and afterward on a\r\nsmooth Metal plate, with a little Tripoly, rub them till they come\r\nto be very smooth; if one of these be fixt with a little soft wax\r\nagainst a small needle hole, prick’d through a thin Plate of Brass,\r\nLead, Pewter, or any other Metal, and an Object, plac’d very near, be\r\nlook’d at through it, it will both magnifie and make some Objects more\r\ndistinct than any of the great Microscopes.”\r\n\r\nThis early worker was noted for the variety of his investigations\r\nrather than for the depths of his learning. Amongst the so-called\r\nObservations, in his book are many that are not connected with\r\nmicroscopic work. The following are interesting and, in the curious old\r\nbook _Micrographia_, there are an extraordinary number of well executed\r\nillustrations. Early in his book Hooke compares various man-made\r\nobjects, such as a razor edge, the point of a needle and a piece of\r\ncloth, with various natural objects, and always to the detriment of\r\nthe former. He examined _Foraminifera_ with his microscope, and was\r\nprobably the first man to draw these beautiful little creatures.\r\nPetrified wood and charcoal also came under his notice. When he studied\r\ncork, he observed that it was made up of “little boxes or cells,” and\r\nthe name cell has survived to this day despite the fact that it is by\r\nno means an appropriate term. That Hooke’s knowledge was not very deep\r\nis shown by the fact that he presumed cork to be a fungus growing on\r\nthe bark of trees.\r\n\r\nMany of the objects we have described in our pages were described and\r\nillustrated by Hooke more than two hundred years ago. The sea mat,\r\ndespite his accurate observations, he mistook for a seaweed, as many\r\nlater naturalists have done. The stinging hairs of nettle he made\r\nout in every detail. Fish scales, bee stings and birds’ feathers all\r\ncame under his notice. The foot of a fly he described with wonderful\r\naccuracy; the scales of a butterfly’s wing and the head of a fly were\r\nall studied and described in detail. On the life history of the gnat\r\nhe made many blunders, but he saved his reputation by remarkable\r\nobservations upon the _Chelifer_, a curious parasite of the fly which\r\nwe mention in our pages, and upon the silver fish, a little creature\r\nwhich frequents sugar and starch. Neither of these organisms had been\r\ndescribed before. Fleas, lice, vinegar-eels and spiders were also\r\nstudied by this indefatigable worker, a worthy collection indeed, but\r\nHooke, like others of his time, was an observer first and foremost. As\r\na methodical, scientific worker he was of little account.\r\n\r\nLiving about the same time as Hooke, the celebrated Italian, Malpighi,\r\nlaid the foundations of much of our present-day knowledge of plant\r\nstructure. Various romantic stories have been told concerning certain\r\nimaginary events which led Malpighi to take up the study of plant\r\nstructure, but the scientist himself refuted these picturesque stories.\r\nSuffice it to say that his book on the subject, _Anatome Plantarum_,\r\nthough imperfect in many respects and, as might be conjectured\r\nin so early a work, often inaccurate, contains a large number of\r\nastonishingly good drawings; many of the original drawings, by the way,\r\nexecuted in red chalk, are in the possession of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that this botanist compared the falling of\r\nleaves to the shedding of an insect’s skin, in this respect at any rate\r\nhe had advanced no further than Aristotle, who compared leaf-fall to\r\nthe moulting of a bird. On the other hand, the Italian was the first\r\nscientist to describe the pores (stomata) of leaves, though he never\r\ndiscovered that they occurred on all leaves. He, first of all men,\r\nshowed that nectar was formed by the flower and not transferred thence\r\nfrom other sources as had previously been believed; he too explained\r\naccurately for the first time the process of germination in the seed.\r\nIt was not alone as a botanist, however, that Malpighi was celebrated.\r\nHe elucidated the various changes which take place during the hatching\r\nof an egg; he was the first man to give an accurate account of the\r\nstructure of an insect, and this he did in his work on the Anatomy of\r\nthe Silkworm. Using a simple microscope for his investigations, he\r\ncontracted an eye affliction during this period from which he suffered\r\nmore or less severely all the rest of his life. He discovered the\r\nbreathing tubes of insects and that when they are covered with grease\r\nthe insect will die “in the time that one can say the Lord’s Prayer”;\r\nthe heart, the silk glands, the development of wings and legs were all\r\ndiscovered for the first time by this untiring worker, aided by his\r\nsimple microscope.\r\n\r\nPages could be filled with accounts of Malpighi’s other scientific work\r\non the structure of the lung, the liver and kidney, the life of the\r\nliver fluke and a hundred and one other subjects. Though undoubtedly a\r\ngreat and clever microscopist, the general estimate seems to be that\r\nhis work had little influence upon the scientific world. The main\r\nreason is that he was ahead of his time; men of the day concluded, for\r\ninstance, that in his Anatomy of Plants he had said the last word on\r\nthe subject, that there was no more to be learned. An English worker,\r\nNehemiah Grew, carried the Italian scientist’s studies of plant\r\nstructure a little further and his Anatomy of Plants contains many new\r\nand often accurate observations. His studies also led him to discover\r\nthe structure of the ridges and sweat pores of the human hand, in fact\r\nGrew may be looked upon as the originator of the study of finger prints.\r\n\r\nA Dutchman, Jan Jacobz Swammerdam by name, and a contemporary of Grew,\r\nwas undoubtedly the most accurate observer amongst these old-time\r\nmicroscopists. Despite ill health, his enthusiasm was unbounded, and a\r\nfriend wrote concerning him: “Swammerdam’s labours were superhuman.\r\nThrough the day he observed incessantly, and at night described and\r\ndrew what he had seen. By six o’clock in the morning in summer he\r\nbegan to find enough light to enable him to trace the minutiæ of\r\nnatural objects. He was hard at work till noon, in full sunlight, and\r\nbareheaded, so as not to obstruct the light, and his head steamed with\r\nprofuse sweat. His eyes, by reason of the blaze of light, became so\r\nweakened that he could not observe minute objects in the afternoon,\r\nfor his eyes were weary.” If only for the fact that the Dutchman made\r\nclear the processes involved in the transformations of insects, his\r\nname would be famous. He described the structure and habits of the hive\r\nbees, male, female and drone with wonderful accuracy, and illustrated\r\nhis work with plates which “would do credit to the most skilful\r\nanatomists of any age.” Swammerdam was sarcastic at times; he had\r\nshown that the facets of a bee’s eye are six-sided and, as so commonly\r\nhappened in those days, some naturalists jumped to a conclusion, in\r\nthis case that the fact explained the six-sidedness of the cells in the\r\nhoney comb. By the same reasoning Swammerdam remarked that men, having\r\nround pupils, should build round houses. It is not only for his study\r\nof the minute structure of insects that this microscopist is noted,\r\nhe worked upon the tadpole and the snail. He it was who discovered\r\nthe red blood corpuscles of the frog, and he described his discovery\r\nin the following terms: “In the blood I perceived the serum in which\r\nfloated an immense number of rounded particles, possessing the shape\r\nof, as it were, a flat oval, but nevertheless wholly regular. These\r\nparticles seemed, however, to contain within themselves the humour[1]\r\nof other particles. When they were looked at sideways, they resembled\r\ntransparent rods, as it were, and many other figures, according, no\r\ndoubt, to the different ways in which they were rolled about in the\r\nserum of the blood. I remarked besides that the colour of the objects\r\nwas the paler the more highly they were magnified by means of the\r\nmicroscope.” Of the snail he made a number of strikingly accurate\r\nstudies, in all of which he was aided by his lenses, so that it is the\r\nmore remarkable that he considered snails to be insects.\r\n\r\nLeeuwenhoek, another Dutchman, we have already mentioned in our\r\nprevious chapter. He of all men brought the simple microscope to its\r\nhighest state of development. His instruments were one of the sights\r\nof Holland, and many eminent personages made a point of seeing them.\r\nThough he had not the advantage of any scientific training and spoke\r\nno other language than his own, he made some remarkable additions\r\nto the scientific knowledge of the time. Like Hooke, he was not a\r\nmethodical worker, he was impelled by an unbounded curiosity. “When\r\nwe are inclined to disparage Leeuwenhoek’s hasty methods it is well\r\nto recollect that he initiated biological inquiries of the greatest\r\ninterest, _e.g._, the parthenogenesis of aphids and the revivification\r\nof dried microscopic organisms, while he gave the first notices, or the\r\nfirst worth mention, of rotifers, Hydra, infusorians, yeast cells and\r\nbacteria.”\r\n\r\nWe may here explain the meaning of the term “parthenogenesis of\r\naphids.” The female aphids or green flies are able to bring forth\r\ngeneration after generation during the first two-thirds or so of each\r\nyear without the assistance of males. This form of increase, which by\r\nthe way accounts for the extraordinary numbers of green fly, is known\r\nas parthenogenesis.\r\n\r\nLeeuwenhoek thought that no one but himself could use his lenses\r\nproperly, in consequence, when he sent any interesting object to a\r\nfriend for him to examine, a lens was always affixed in place so that\r\nthe object could be seen to the best advantage. He gave a set of his\r\nlenses and objects to the Royal Society, and described his gift as\r\n“a small black cabinet, lackered and gilded, which has five little\r\ndrawers in it, wherein are contained thirteen long and square tin\r\nboxes, covered with black leather. In each of these boxes are two\r\nground microscopes, in all six and twenty; which I did grind myself,\r\nand set in silver; and most of the silver was what I had extracted from\r\nminerals, and separated from the gold that was mixed with it; and an\r\naccount of each glass goes along with them.”\r\n\r\nKircher, whose work we mentioned in our last chapter, was overwhelmed\r\nwith the notion that various living creatures are generated from\r\nnon-living matter. Fleas, for example, he was certain, came from dirt,\r\nand it remained for Leeuwenhoek to prove that they arise from eggs and\r\ngrubs, in the manner now so well understood.\r\n\r\nHe carefully studied the structure of a garden spider, and for the\r\nfirst time explained its wonderful feet, its jaws and poison gland,\r\nits spinnerets and silk. He studied _Hydra_ first of all men, and\r\nsaid that, under the microscope, its tentacles appeared to be several\r\nfathoms long. Although sadly at sea over the correct position of his\r\nsnails in the animal world, he was clever enough to include _Volvox_\r\namongst the plants and fortunate enough to see the young forms escape\r\nfrom the parent colony.\r\n\r\nConcerning this microscopist’s early studies in bacteriology we may\r\nquote from Professor Miall’s _The Early Naturalists_, a book by the\r\nway of the greatest interest to those who would learn something of\r\nthe struggles of the men who laid the foundations of our present-day\r\nbiological knowledge.\r\n\r\nProfessor Miall says: “In 1683 Leeuwenhoek wrote a letter to the Royal\r\nSociety which contains the first mention of bacteria. He had been\r\nwriting and speculating upon saliva, and had searched the saliva of\r\nthe human mouth for animalcules without finding any. It then occurred\r\nto him to ask whether the teeth might lodge animalcules discharged\r\nfrom the salivary ducts. He tells us that, though his own teeth were\r\nscrupulously clean and particularly sound for his age (about fifty),\r\nthe lens revealed a white deposit upon them. This deposit was found to\r\ncontain minute rods, some of which showed either a steady or gyratory\r\nmovement. Others were very minute, of rounded form, and moved with\r\nremarkable velocity. The largest of all, which were either straight\r\nor bent were motionless. The teeth of an old man, which were never\r\ncleansed, contained among others large rods which exhibited snake-like\r\nundulations. Rubbing the teeth with strong vinegar did not kill the\r\nmoving bodies, but they became quiescent when detached and placed in a\r\nmixture of vinegar and saliva, or vinegar and water. Nine years later\r\nLeeuwenhoek returned to the subject. Living particles were no longer\r\nmet with in his teeth, and he was at a loss to explain why, until\r\nit occurred to him that he was accustomed to drink hot coffee every\r\nmorning. This, he thought might have killed the animalcules, and his\r\nconclusion was confirmed by finding that on the back teeth, which were\r\nless exposed to the hot drink, plenty of them were still to be found.\r\nIn 1697 he tells how he pulled out a decayed tooth, and found that the\r\ncavity abounded in moving particles.” Nearly a hundred years elapsed\r\nbefore anyone else took up the study of bacteria.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Leeuwenhoek onwards, scientific discoveries were\r\nannounced in rapid succession, so that in one short chapter it is\r\nimpossible to keep pace with the progress that was made. Among the\r\ngreat men who owe much of their success to the microscope we may\r\nmention the Frenchman Réaumur, whose memory is kept green for all\r\ntime by his thermometer; as a worker upon problems of insect life\r\nhe was indefatigable; the Swede, Linnæus, to whose early efforts we\r\nowe the orderly arrangement of living creatures and plants, known as\r\nclassification. This arrangement has been considerably modified, more\r\nmodern ideas have upset much that he initiated, yet he remains the\r\nparent of orderly arrangement.\r\n\r\nBuffon, a great naturalist, was followed by Cuvier, the first serious\r\nstudent of fossils; by Humboldt, naturalist and traveller; by Robert\r\nBrown, the founder of modern Botany; by Darwin and by Pasteur in turn.\r\nHow much these men owe to the microscope can never be known; certain\r\nit is that without its assistance our world, the world we know and can\r\nsee, would have been smaller than it is to-day.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] Humour is here used in its original sense, meaning moisture or a\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE ACTION OF LIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to remark that the wonderful properties of the\r\nmicroscope depend upon light. Without light, lenses would be useless,\r\nobjects could not be illuminated and we could not see them. In this\r\nshort chapter we propose to give a brief outline of the action of\r\nlight; if our words appear to savour of the school-book, we shall try\r\nto avoid it, but, we repeat, if they do so we would remind our readers\r\nthat the more one knows of the action of light the better use one can\r\nmake of one’s instrument. As a well-known microscopist has remarked\r\nwe may be able to afford a costly harp or a costly microscope, but\r\nalthough we may be able to strike a few notes on the former and examine\r\na few objects with the latter, we can only make the best use of either\r\nby thoroughly understanding and practising upon it.\r\n\r\nThe first thing we learn when we study light is that it travels in\r\nstraight lines. The chief source of light to the inhabitants of this\r\nearth is the sun. Now the sun is so far away that, for all practical\r\npurposes, the rays of light coming from it may be looked upon as being\r\nparallel to one another. That we must always remember, when dealing\r\nwith the sun, though, of course, it does not apply when we are dealing\r\nwith lights near at hand, unless they are specially constructed to\r\nthrow parallel beams or rays, whichever we elect to call them. To\r\nprove that light travels in straight lines is not difficult, and we\r\nmay devise a number of experiments for the purpose. The doors and\r\nventilators of many dark rooms, in which photographic operations are\r\ncarried on, are constructed on the assumption that light cannot travel\r\nround corners. An arrangement as shown in the diagram will allow air,\r\nbut no light, to pass. If light were capable of going round corners,\r\nsome other arrangement would have to be devised for the ventilation of\r\ndark rooms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHaving learned so much about light, we come to the most important fact\r\nof all, as far as the action of light concerns microscopic work. When\r\nrays of light travel, from a substance like air into a substance like\r\nwater, they are bent out of their straight course. Without any desire\r\nto introduce a number of unfamiliar words, we may venture to remark\r\nthat, any substance through which light passes is called a medium.\r\nSome media are clearly more dense, more compact or solid--dense is the\r\nproper word--than others. Water is more dense than air and glass than\r\neither. The bending of light rays is known as refraction. So now we may\r\nstate our second law a little more concisely, thus:--When light passes\r\nfrom a medium into one more dense, or _vice versa_, it is refracted,\r\nand the more dense the medium into which or from which the light passes\r\nthe greater the refraction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA diagram and an experiment should make matters clear. Suppose AB is a\r\nray of light traveling in air and that it falls on a sheet of water,\r\nWXYZ, the ray will be bent along BC and its course from air to water\r\nmay be represented by ABC. Suppose again, WXYZ represents, not water\r\nbut glass; as glass is more dense than water the course of the ray AB\r\nis represented by ABD, it is refracted or bent to a greater extent\r\nthan the ray which passed from air into water.\r\n\r\nFor our experiment we need only plunge a stick into water and notice\r\nthat, owing to this property of light, the stick appears bent, from the\r\npoint where it comes into contact with the surface of the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSome of us may be old enough to remember that once, on either corner of\r\nnearly every mantlepiece, there stood an ornament of doubtful utility\r\nfrom which there hung a dozen or more glass prisms. Now the only beauty\r\nabout these otherwise hideous contraptions was to be seen when light\r\nplayed upon them. Then patches of violet, green, yellow and red were\r\nthrown upon neighbouring objects. White light, ordinary sunlight that\r\nis to say, is really composed of various colours--violet, indigo, blue,\r\ngreen, yellow, orange and red--which, when combined together, make\r\nlight as we know it. When white light passes through a prism of glass,\r\nit is not only bent out of its course, but broken up into all these\r\ncolours. A prism, as we all know, when examined at either end, is seen\r\nto be triangular in shape. Putting aside for a moment the question of\r\nthe breaking up of light into its component parts, the path of a ray\r\nof light through a prism is shown in the diagram. As the ray passes\r\nfrom air into glass it is bent, because glass is more dense than air;\r\nit is bent once more on leaving the prism because air is less dense\r\nthan glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow lenses are made of various shapes, and those with two outwardly\r\ncurved surfaces are known as double convex lenses. A double convex lens\r\nis usually made with both its surfaces equally curved and in the finer\r\noptical work great care is taken to ensure that this is the case. For\r\ncertain purposes, however, as we shall learn in a moment, one or other\r\nof the faces only may be much more curved than its companion and this\r\nmay be carried to such an extreme that one face is flat, the lens is\r\nthen known as plano-convex. Lenses may also have inwardly curved faces,\r\nif both are of this design they are called double concave; if one face\r\nis flat and the other inwardly curved they are known as plano-concave.\r\nThere are other combinations, for example, one face may be inwardly\r\ncurved and the other outwardly curved, but the four kinds we have\r\ndescribed are all that need trouble us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt does not require a great amount of imagination to recognise that\r\nthe double convex lens, that is the lens with two outwardly curved\r\nfaces is little more than a pair of prisms placed base to base, or more\r\naccurately, a number of prisms so arranged as shown in the diagram.\r\nParallel rays of light falling upon such an arrangement of prisms\r\nwould be bent from their course, as shown by the arrows, and this is\r\njust what happens with a double convex lens. Now rays of light from\r\nan object, passing through a lens of this shape may follow any one of\r\nthree courses, according to the position of the object with regard to\r\nthe lens. In one position and one only the rays after passing through\r\nthe lens will be parallel to one another, as shown in the diagram.\r\n\r\nThe only position of the object for the above to take place is when\r\nit coincides with a point known as the principal focus of the lens,\r\nconversely the parallel rays of light from the sun, after passing\r\nthrough a double convex lens, will come to a point at its principal\r\nfocus.\r\n\r\nSuppose now that the object be placed at a point beyond the principal\r\nfocus of the lens, the light rays therefrom will, after passing through\r\nthe lens, converge to a point thus:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the diagram O is the object and P the principal focus of the lens.\r\n\r\nThe third case occurs where the object is nearer to the lens than its\r\nprincipal focus, then the rays after passing through the lens, diverge\r\nand never meet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that when white light passes through a prism\r\nit is broken up into different coloured rays varying from violet to\r\nred. The reason for this is that all the light rays composing white\r\nlight are not bent equally as they pass from one medium to another.\r\nThe violet rays are bent the most, the indigo next, blue next, down to\r\nred, which is least bent. Once more, considering the double convex lens\r\nas made up of a number of prisms, let us represent, by a diagram, the\r\ncourse of parallel rays of white light through it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA A′ represent the parallel rays of white light falling on the lens, L\r\nL′. The blue rays are bent more than the red, so the principal focus\r\nof the former is at C and of the latter at D. The consequence of this\r\ndifference in bending of the various coloured light rays would be\r\nmost serious in microscopic work were not means devised to overcome\r\nit. Objects for instance at C in our diagram would appear blue, at D\r\nthey would appear red, whilst at E E′ though no single colour would\r\npredominate they would be illumined with many coloured rays, though\r\nless strongly than at C or D.\r\n\r\nThis chromatic aberration, as it is called, depends amongst other\r\nthings on the nature of the glass used in lens construction. It has\r\nbeen found, however, that a combination of flint and of crown glass\r\nwill overcome the difficulty. In a later chapter we shall explain\r\nthe difference between these two kinds of glass. In practice, a\r\nplano-concave lens of flint glass is combined with a double convex lens\r\nof crown glass and, if the nature of the glass is satisfactory, as\r\nalso the shapes of the lenses, there is full correction for chromatic\r\naberration, and objects viewed through such a lens will not appear with\r\ncoloured margins.\r\n\r\nThere is one further trouble likely to occur in such, or any lens. We\r\nwrite of the rays meeting at a point. In our diagrams we represent the\r\nrays by straight lines, really they are much more complicated than they\r\nappear in a diagram. It is quite easy to take a ruler and make our\r\nimaginary light rays meet at a point, as a matter of fact, where real\r\nlenses and real light rays are concerned, it is very difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, to make the latter meet at a single point. One more diagram\r\nmay make the matter clear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nParallel rays A pass through our lens and, as we know, they should all\r\nmeet at a point P, the principal focus of the lens; the majority do so,\r\nbut some meet at other points, such as P′. In consequence of this it\r\nis difficult to obtain a clear image of an object at P, and the lens is\r\nsaid to suffer from spherical aberration. The perfect simple lens would\r\nbe one fully corrected for chromatic and spherical aberration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE COMPOUND MICROSCOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our chapters, dealing with, the history of the Microscope, we\r\nattempted to trace the gradual development of the compound instrument\r\nfrom the simple lens; we stated that the latter, in a crude form, had\r\nbeen known and used from very early times and that the former developed\r\nside by side with the telescope. We have also said a few words in\r\nChapter III. concerning light for the reason that the microscope can\r\nbe better understood and used more efficiently when we are acquainted\r\nwith the phenomena due to light. The simple lens, sold under the name\r\nof pocket magnifier, in its cheapest form consists of a double convex\r\nlens, that is to say, a lens with two outwardly curved surfaces. Better\r\nquality pocket magnifiers consist of two or more lenses, which may be\r\neither double convex; plano-convex, _i.e._, with one surface perfectly\r\nflat and the other outwardly curved, or they may be constructed of a\r\ncombination of double convex and plano-concave lenses, such as were\r\ndescribed on p. .\r\n\r\nThe object of both the simple and compound microscope is to make\r\nobjects appear larger than they do to the naked eye. When we buy our\r\npocket lens we shall find that these little instruments are constructed\r\nto give different degrees of enlargement, some make objects appear\r\nfive times larger than they do to the naked eye, some ten, some\r\nfifteen and some twenty times larger. Twenty times is about the limit\r\nof magnification for the ordinary pocket lens. If we are observant we\r\nshall notice something else--the greater the magnification the nearer\r\nwe must hold the lens to our object. Within certain limits, this is\r\nnot a very serious matter, but a point is reached where we must hold\r\nour lens so near to the object that we cannot see it, and that is why\r\nwe cannot obtain very great enlargement with a pocket lens. Despite\r\nthis fact, as we read in our opening chapter, some very wonderful\r\ndiscoveries have been made with these simple microscopes.\r\n\r\nNow we wish to show how a compound microscope works and, having done\r\nso, to explain the uses of its various parts. We shall consider the\r\nlenses of the instrument to be double convex; we do this for the sake\r\nof simplicity. Even in the cheapest compound microscopes of to-day\r\nsimple convex lenses are never used, for the reason we explained in\r\nour last chapter. To understand the course of the light rays passing\r\nthrough our microscope, however, we may look upon the lenses as being\r\nmerely double convex.\r\n\r\nLet us try a simple experiment first of all. For the purpose we require\r\ntwo double convex lenses, one capable of magnifying more than the\r\nother, a sheet of paper and a candle. We must darken the room in which\r\nwe make the experiment and, having lighted the candle, we may proceed\r\nto make a compound microscope, for that is really what we are about to\r\ndo. Taking the lens which gives the greatest magnification, we look\r\nthrough it till we can see a clearly defined image of the lighted\r\ncandle, then we fix the lens at that spot, so that, during the rest of\r\nour experiment, the candle and lens remain at the same distance from\r\none another. Now we put the piece of paper as nearly as we can in the\r\nposition of our eye, moving it nearer or further from the lens till we\r\nhave a perfectly clear image of the candle thrown upon it. The first\r\nthing to strike us is that the image is upside down; it is known as a\r\nreal, inverted image. Real because it can be thrown upon a screen and\r\ninverted--well because it is upside down. There are some images, as we\r\nshall learn in a moment, which can be seen but which cannot be thrown\r\nupon a screen: they are called virtual images.\r\n\r\nHaving fixed our sheet of paper in position, we take our second lens,\r\nfocus it sharply upon the back of the sheet of paper, being careful to\r\nkeep the centres of the two lenses as far as possible in a straight\r\nline with one another. Having obtained a sharp image we remove the\r\npaper and gradually advance our second lens towards the first. We soon\r\nreach a point where we have a very much larger image of the candle than\r\nthe first lens gave us; we must fix our second lens at this point\r\nfor we now have a compound microscope, a very crude one certainly and\r\nwithout the trimmings which make the microscope so useful. Before we\r\nproceed to explain what has happened to the light rays we must take our\r\npaper screen once more and place it as near as possible to the spot\r\nwhere our eye was situated when we saw the second image. We shall find\r\nthat, however much we may move our screen to or from the second lens we\r\ncan never manage to obtain an image upon it for the reason that this\r\nsecond image is virtual, but unlike the first image it is not inverted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOne or two diagrams will help to explain our experiment and, instead of\r\nthe lighted candle, we will suppose that our object is an arrow--it is\r\neasier to draw and serves just as well. The magnification of the object\r\nby our first lens may be represented by the diagram below, where AA is\r\nthe lens, CD the object and D′C′ its image.\r\n\r\nThe arrow C′D′ shows the point at which we placed our screen, and as\r\nour diagram shows, the image is magnified and inverted.\r\n\r\nOur second lens, we remember, was focussed on the back of the paper,\r\nplaced at C′D′; for practical purposes we may ignore the thickness of\r\nthe paper and say that it was focussed on the image C′D′. Had we left\r\nit at that, the further course of the rays through the second lens\r\nwould be represented by a replica of the diagram we have just given.\r\nBut, in our experiment, we moved the second lens nearer and nearer to\r\nC′D′ till we obtained a clear much magnified erect image of C′D′, let\r\nus call this second image C″D″, and represent the course of the light\r\nrays by a diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe may well ask, why did the lens AA, our first lens, form a real\r\nimage whilst the second lens BB, which is precisely similar to AA,\r\nexcept that its magnifying power is not so great, form a virtual\r\nimage? The formation of a real or a virtual image is nothing to do\r\nwith magnification, so we repeat--why do two similar lenses form\r\ndifferent kinds of images? Let us refresh our memories with the\r\nremarks concerning the principal focus of lenses in the last chapter,\r\nthen we may try another experiment. The principle focus of a double\r\nconvex lens, we remember, is the point to which parallel rays of\r\nlight converge, after passing through the lens. If now our object is\r\nfurther away from the lens than its principal focus, a state of affairs\r\nthat existed in the case of our lens AA and the object CD, we obtain\r\na magnified, real but inverted image; if, on the other hand, using\r\nthe same lens if we wish, the object is nearer to the lens than its\r\nprincipal focus, we obtain a magnified virtual and erect image. The\r\nform of image then depends on the relative positions of lens and object\r\nand not on the magnifying powers of the former.\r\n\r\nAfter this digression, we will see what happens when we combine the\r\ndiagram showing the real, inverted image, formed by the lens AA with\r\nthe virtual erect image, formed by the lens BB. In reality we will\r\ndraw a diagram showing the path of the light rays through our compound\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe have used the same lettering as in our previous diagrams and we\r\nsee that, also as before, a real, inverted image C′D′ of the object\r\nCD is formed by the lens AA and a virtual, erect image C″D″ of the\r\nimage C′D′ is formed by the lens BB, the object CD being further from\r\nthe lens AA than its principal focus and the image C′D′ being nearer\r\nto the lens BB than its principal focus. One very important point we\r\nmust notice before we leave the diagram. We have mentioned several\r\ntimes that the image formed by BB is erect and so it is, but it is an\r\nerect image of an already inverted image, so that the final image of\r\nCD, as seen by the eye E is inverted. The fact that objects viewed\r\nthrough the microscope appear upside down is puzzling at first. To all\r\nintents our two double convex lenses represent a compound microscope;\r\nactually, they should be fixed at either end of a tube, blackened on\r\nthe inside. The lens AA, nearest to the object, would then be known\r\nas the objective and the lens BB nearest to the observer’s eye would\r\nbe known as the ocular or, more commonly the eyepiece. There are, of\r\ncourse, very many refinements, designed to make the instrument capable\r\nof performing the most accurate work, and needless to say these simple\r\nlenses would neither give very great magnification nor any clear\r\nimages. Let us describe a more refined compound microscope than the\r\none we constructed in our darkened room. The optical parts, that is\r\nto say the lenses, are the most important parts of every microscope,\r\nupon their qualities depend the degree of efficiency of the instrument;\r\nthe metal portions, known collectively as the stand, contribute to the\r\neasier, smoother working of the microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _By the courtesy of Messrs. F. Davidson & Co._\r\n\r\n  THE HEAD OF A DOG FLEA\r\n\r\n  No wonder the flea is an annoying creature. As the plate shows, it is\r\n  armed with knives, lances and saws, all designed to injure the skin\r\n  of its victim.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe stand must claim our attention first. The base of the instrument,\r\ncalled the foot, is usually either three-legged or horse-shoe shaped;\r\nwhatever its form it should be heavy, for only thus can the microscope\r\nbe steady, and steadiness is essential in all microscopic work. At\r\nthe top of the foot there is a joint, in order that all the other parts\r\nof the stand may be inclined at any angle, from the vertical to the\r\nhorizontal. Just above the joint is a bent arm of brass, to the forward\r\nend of which a brass tube is affixed. This tube is designed to hold\r\nthe lenses, the objective at its lower end, the eyepiece at its upper\r\nend. The tube is always blackened inside; were this not the case, light\r\npassing through the objective would be reflected in all directions from\r\nthe sides of the tube and a clear image of the object could never be\r\nobtained. The tubes of microscopes vary in length according to their\r\ncountry of origin; English and American tubes are ten inches long,\r\nthose of continental make vary from a little more than six inches to\r\nrather more than seven inches in length.\r\n\r\nAffixed to the lower end of the bent arm of brass, mentioned above,\r\nis a flat metal plate, known as the stage; at its centre, there is a\r\ncircular hole through which rays of light pass to illuminate objects\r\nplaced upon it. Below the stage, at the edge nearest to the foot, there\r\nis a metal peg, over which fits a tube to which a mirror is attached by\r\na moveable joint. The mirror reflects light rays through the opening\r\nin the stage. The tube, holding it, can be slipped up and down the peg\r\nunder the stage, thereby bringing it nearer to or further from the\r\nobject and so altering the intensity of the reflected light, as we\r\nshall explain in a moment. Owing to its moveable joint, it is possible\r\nto swing the mirror to the right or left, so that the reflected light\r\nrays do not pass directly through the object on the stage, but strike\r\nit on one side or the other, thereby giving what is known as oblique\r\nillumination.\r\n\r\nThe cheapest forms of compound microscopes have all the parts we have\r\nmentioned, and focussing is carried out by sliding the tube, with its\r\nobjective and eyepiece, up and down within its holder, in order to\r\nbring the objective further from or nearer to the object.\r\n\r\nIn more expensive instruments there are further refinements, in fact,\r\non some of the very costly present-day instruments, there are so many\r\nappendages and appurtenances that it is doubtful whether some of them\r\nare not more of a hindrance than a help, at any rate they increase the\r\npossibility of trouble by their liability to get out of order. Such\r\nmicroscopes are only of use to very expert workers; there are, however,\r\na good many additional features to be found on quite moderate-priced\r\ninstruments, features which are a great help to the microscopist.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that we cannot attain any degree of accuracy in\r\nfocussing, especially with high magnifications, when we must perforce\r\nraise or lower the tube by hand. To obviate this difficulty, most\r\nmicroscopes are provided with mechanism known as a coarse adjustment;\r\nit consists of milled screws at either end of a metal rod; in the\r\ncentre of the rod there is a little cog-wheel which engages with a row\r\nof notches on the tube. By turning the milled screws slightly in either\r\ndirection, we can impart a considerable upward or downward movement\r\nto the tube carrying the objective and focussing at once becomes a\r\nmore simple matter. The coarse adjustment is only useful for examining\r\nobjects with a low magnification; if we use it when objects are being\r\nhighly magnified we run the risk of screwing our objective down upon\r\nour object, to the certain destruction of the latter and the probable\r\ninjury of the former. To obviate such a catastrophe, most of the\r\nbetter class microscopes are also provided with a fine adjustment. By\r\nmeans of this adjustment, which externally takes the form of a single\r\nmilled screw, a considerable turn of the screw in either direction only\r\nimparts a very slight upward or downward movement to the microscope\r\ntube. In the best instruments, movements of as little as one hundredth\r\npart of a millimetre may be imparted to the tube by the fine adjustment\r\nand, seeing that there are about twenty-five and a half millimetres to\r\nthe inch, it is obvious that a good fine adjustment is very delicate\r\nand, being so, must be treated with care. The fine adjustment is used\r\nto supplement coarse adjustment in the final focussing, when using high\r\nmagnifications.\r\n\r\nA few words may be devoted to the mirror, for on its intelligent use\r\nmuch depends. Usually we shall find that it is plano-concave, that is\r\nto say, flat on one side and hollowed out on the other. The use of\r\nthe mirror, as we have mentioned already, is to reflect rays of light\r\nthrough the opening of the stage on to the object we desire to examine.\r\nBoth mirrors will reflect parallel rays of light to a point, just as a\r\ndouble convex lens will so direct them from their course that they meet\r\nat a point. The concave mirror gives the more powerful illumination,\r\nbecause it reflects more light rays than a flat mirror of the same\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned that, to obtain full advantage from the mirror it\r\nshould be capable of movement to and from the stage. When we desire\r\nstrong illumination we arrange the mirror so that its reflected rays\r\nmeet at a point coinciding with our object. Should less intense\r\nillumination be required, we slide the mirror nearer to the stage, and\r\nof course nearer to our object, so that the reflected rays meet at a\r\npoint above the object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe two diagrams, given below, show the path of the rays of light,\r\nwhere O is the object, and a trial with our microscope will soon show\r\nwhich position gives the more powerful illumination.\r\n\r\nFor high-power work, such as bacteriology or even the examination of\r\nsections of plants, etc., even the best concave mirror will not give a\r\nsufficiently powerful illumination; accordingly an instrument, known\r\nas the condenser, is fixed below the stage, between the mirror and the\r\nobject. The condenser, as its name implies, condenses the rays of light\r\nreflected to it by the mirror. It consists of a series of lenses so\r\narranged that they will throw a very powerful cone of light. Provision\r\nis made for focussing the rays from the condenser on to the object.\r\n\r\nSometimes, for special forms of illumination, it is necessary to cut\r\noff some of the rays of light passing through the condenser. It may be\r\nthat we desire to dispense with the outer rays of the cone of light\r\nor, when delicate details are being studied, we may wish to impede the\r\ncentral rays. In either case diaphragms, popularly called “stops” are\r\nused. Our diagrams show A the outer rays of a cone of light cut off and\r\nB the central rays similarly treated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn old pattern microscopes and in many instruments not provided with\r\ncondensers, the diaphragm used for the purpose of cutting off the outer\r\nrays of the cone of light, consists of a blackened circular metal\r\nplate, perforated with a number of different sized circular holes.\r\nThis plate is fixed below the stage in such a manner that, as it is\r\nrevolved, holes of various diameters are brought one by one within the\r\ncone of light. It need hardy be remarked that the smaller the hole\r\nin the diaphragm the more light is cut off and the less reaches the\r\nobject. In more modern instruments and in practically all which are\r\nfitted with a condenser, an Iris diaphragm is fitted. A diaphragm of\r\nthis nature consists of a number of thin, blackened, metal leaves,\r\nfastened to a metal ring in such a manner that, when the ring is\r\nrevolved, the leaves close together, making the opening in the centre\r\nsmaller and smaller. The Iris diaphragm has many advantages over the\r\nold perforated metal plate. At will, we can have any opening from full\r\nto the merest pin-point or we can cut off the light rays altogether,\r\nshould we wish to do so; we are not confined to a definite number of\r\nstops. As we cut off these outer rays of light we shall find that, up\r\nto a certain point, though the illumination becomes less and less the\r\nobject becomes more and more clear, or, to use the correct expression,\r\nits definition is improved.\r\n\r\nWhen it is necessary to cut off some of the central rays of the light\r\ncone, either a circle of glass with an opaque centre is dropped into a\r\nmetal holder below the stage, or a circular metal plate, held in the\r\ncentre of a metal ring by three arms, is used in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe effect of cutting off the central rays of the light cone is, of\r\ncourse, to reduce the illumination and to show up delicate detail to\r\nadvantage. No direct rays of light reach the objective, such as do\r\npass into the microscope are all diffused from the edges of the object.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned that the optical parts of the compound\r\nmicroscope are of greater importance than what may be termed the\r\nmechanical portions and the objectives are more important than\r\nthe eyepieces. Better results can always be obtained with a good,\r\nhigh-power objective and a low-power eyepiece, than with an inferior\r\nobjective and a good quality eyepiece. The merits of the eyepiece,\r\nhowever great, will not be adequate compensation for the failings of\r\nthe objective. Modern objectives are composed of several lenses and of\r\na combination of flint and crown glass, as we explained in our last\r\nchapter. They are so designed that they can be screwed into the lower\r\npart of the microscope tube. The focal length of each objective is,\r\nor should be, marked upon it; as a general rule, however, it may be\r\ntaken that the smaller the lower lens, the shorter its focal length and\r\ntherefore the greater its magnifying power.\r\n\r\nThe form of eyepiece most usually met with is known as Huyghen’s.\r\nIt consists of two plano-convex lenses, with their flat or plane\r\nsurfaces directed away from the objective. The smaller of the two\r\nlenses is situated nearer to the eye of the observer and is known\r\nas the eyeglass; its function is to magnify the image formed by\r\nthe objective. The larger, lower lens is known as the field or\r\ncollecting glass; it renders the image clearer though, in so doing,\r\nit reduces the magnification of the eyeglass. In instruments provided\r\nwith more than one eyepiece we shall wish to know which gives the\r\ngreater magnification; this is or should be marked upon the metal rim\r\nsurrounding the eyeglass but, in general, it may be stated that the\r\nshorter the eyepiece the greater its magnification. We repeat again,\r\nincrease your magnification always, when possible, by using higher\r\npower objectives rather than eyepieces with greater magnifying powers.\r\nSometimes it is necessary to use a greater magnification than our most\r\npowerful objective will give us; then we must fit our most powerful\r\neyepiece and draw out the upper part of the microscope tube--in the\r\nbest instruments they are made to pull out, after the manner of the\r\ntelescope. The effect of so doing will be to increase the magnification\r\nconsiderably but, at the same time, the definition or clearness is\r\nseriously impaired.\r\n\r\nFor the examination of practically all our microscopic objects we\r\nrequire a number of slides, little glass slips of good, thin, clear\r\nglass. They may be used over and over again unless we make permanent\r\npreparations, but we are hardly likely to do so in our early days. The\r\nslides are held in place on the microscope stage, either by a pair of\r\nclips attached thereto or by resting against a bar running across the\r\nstage. We may here remark that it is essential always to keep one’s\r\nmicroscope slides absolutely clean. Dirty slides denote the careless\r\nworker; moreover, dirt when magnified is misleading. Objects which\r\nare being examined in water or any other liquid should be covered\r\nwith a cover-slip, an exceedingly thin circle or square of glass. The\r\ncover-slip is as much a protection for the objective as for the object\r\nand its cleanliness also, is all important.\r\n\r\nWe have not mentioned any refinements such as the mechanical stage, by\r\nmeans of which slides on the stage may be rotated, moved to the front\r\nand to the back of the stage or from side to side. We have omitted\r\nthese because they are not essential even for the very best work; they\r\nlend additional comfort to the use of the microscope but, again, they\r\nare not essential. The microscopist who requires such luxuries may\r\nlearn about them in the larger text-books on the microscope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE IN THE PONDS AND STREAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enthusiastic microscopist will probably never lack material for his\r\ninstrument, whatever branch of microscopical work he may decide to make\r\nhis own. To the student of Pond Life, either animal or vegetable, there\r\nis granted a never-ending store of beautiful and interesting objects.\r\nBecause one pond has been thoroughly searched and all that it can offer\r\nhas been carefully examined, we must not conclude that no other pond\r\nwill be worth our attention. Though indeed many little animals occur\r\nover and over again in practically every pond, there are other equally\r\ninteresting animals which only occur in certain localities and for\r\nthese we must keep a sharp look-out.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus needed for the collection of the denizens of ponds and\r\nstreams, need consist of no more than a net with a very fine mesh and a\r\njar in which to bring our captures home; for, of course, animals which\r\ndwell in water need not be dried on the journey home. Various useful\r\naccessories for the student of pond life are sold at very reasonable\r\nrates by most scientific instrument makers.\r\n\r\nWe shall find many representatives of the animal world in our pond\r\nand exceedingly interesting most of them will prove. From the mud we\r\nmay obtain the “protean animalcule,” known to scientists as _Amœba\r\nProteus_, the most lowly of all animals. Though this creature is\r\nplentiful and just visible to the naked eye, he is not easy to separate\r\nfrom his surroundings. He is almost colourless and therefore paler than\r\nthe mud. Having secured him on the end of a glass rod, let us examine\r\nhim in a drop of water on a slide. At first he will remain motionless,\r\nas a protest against being disturbed; we shall not have to wait long,\r\nhowever, for soon one part of his body will be seen to protrude and\r\nthen grow larger and larger till it forms a false foot; other parts may\r\nfollow suit, till he is more elongate than oval, and he moves in the\r\ndirection of his false foot with a curious gliding motion. His pace is\r\nnot great and has been calculated at a twenty-fifth of an inch in an\r\nhour. Really the “protean animalcule” is little more than an animated\r\ndrop of jelly, a fact we can substantiate by watching him feed. His\r\nfood consists of minute water plants such as diatoms, and when one of\r\nthese plants comes within his line of march he simply surrounds it with\r\nhis false feet and, as it were, flows around it. When he has digested\r\nall he can he flows away from the undigested portions; he has no mouth\r\nor any of the organs usually associated with animal anatomy.\r\n\r\nWhile hunting for our _Amœba_, it is highly probable that a very\r\nactive little slipper-shaped organism may have forced himself upon our\r\nattention. From his shape he has earned the popular name of the slipper\r\nanimalcule. He is rather more highly organised than the _Amœba_ for he\r\npossesses a mouth, as we shall see when we are able to examine him. So\r\nrapidly does he swim, however, that something must be done to curb his\r\nactivity; he may either be killed with a drop of weak acid or we may\r\nput a little tuft of cotton wool on our drop of water and a coverslip\r\nlightly over that. The threads of cotton wool will form a network, in\r\nthe meshes of which the active little animalcule will be confined.\r\nCareful observation will show that he is, like a slipper, more pointed\r\nat one end than at the other; that there is a funnel-shaped orifice,\r\nhis mouth, at one side of his body; and that he is covered with little\r\nthreads which lash the water with rhythmic movement and propel him with\r\nconsiderable rapidity. These little threads also send currents of water\r\nto his mouth, and in the water is his food.\r\n\r\nHaving examined these two free swimming denizens of the pond, we may\r\nadvantageously turn our attention to some of the weeds growing therein.\r\nCareful examination with our pocket lens will almost certainly reveal a\r\nnumber of minute living creatures attached to the submerged stems and\r\nleaves. It is impossible to describe all the interesting creatures we\r\nmight find: we must content ourselves with two, because they are common\r\ninhabitants of many ponds. One interesting little creature we are\r\nalmost certain to find, the _Hydra_. He may be green or he may be brown\r\nbut in structure he will remind us of a small sea anemone. When we\r\nput him under the microscope he has the appearance of a mass of jelly\r\nattached to the water plant on which we found him. He will soon open\r\nhimself out, however, and we shall see that his free end is provided\r\nwith a number of tentacles; these he waves about in the water to draw\r\nsmall swimming creatures to his mouth which is situated in the centre\r\nof the group of tentacles. Any luckless creature, coming within reach\r\nof the _Hydra_, is at once stung with one of the barb-shaped stings\r\nwhich stud his tentacles and then passed to his mouth. The _Hydra_\r\nis wonderfully tenacious of life; it is said that he has been turned\r\ninside out, like a glove finger, without suffering any inconvenience.\r\nProbably the specimen we are examining will have a swelling on the side\r\nof its body, which might be mistaken for the result of some injury; it\r\nis nothing of the kind; it is merely a bud which will grow into a young\r\n_Hydra_ and, when old enough, become detached from its parent and float\r\naway to another plant. Under a fairly high magnification, we shall\r\nalmost certainly see something gliding rapidly over the body of the\r\n_Hydra_; its movements are too quick to allow of careful examination;\r\nthe creature which is almost as elusive as the slipper animalcule is a\r\nparasite of the _Hydra_.\r\n\r\nNot quite so common as our last object but still common enough to be\r\nmentioned here is the beautiful “bell animalcule.” Like the _Hydra_,\r\nthis creature, except in its very young stages, remains affixed to a\r\nwater plant. In shape the “bell animalcule” resembles a wineglass on\r\na long delicate stem; round the part corresponding to the rim of the\r\nglass, there is a fringe of the hair-like, water-lashing structures\r\nwith which so many of these lowly creatures are provided, and these\r\nstructures also surround the entrance to the funnel-shaped mouth. When\r\nundisturbed, the bell animalcule has its slender stalk fully extended\r\nand its little threads lash the water vigorously, causing currents,\r\ncontaining food material, to travel towards its mouth. A sharp tap on\r\nthe microscope slide will cause the creature to contract, the threads\r\ncease their lashing and the stalk contracts spirally, so that the body\r\nof the animalcule is drawn close to the object to which it is attached.\r\nBy degrees the spiral uncoils and the little threads resume their\r\nlashing.\r\n\r\nSometimes, as we examine our bell animalcule, we may be fortunate\r\nenough to see it splitting into two parts to form two separate\r\nindividuals. This curious process should be watched carefully. The\r\nupper part of the bell splits first and, by degrees the whole bell\r\ndivides into two equal parts so that we have a pair of bells on a\r\nsingle stalk. The next stage consists of the formation of a ring of\r\nwhip-like structures round the base of one of the bells; both bells,\r\nby the way, have the circlet of whips round their upper edges. Soon\r\nafter these additional little whips are formed, the owner of them\r\nbreaks away from the stalk and swims about in the water for a time,\r\nfinally coming to rest on a suitable water weed. Then the lower ring\r\nof whips has served its purpose and in its place a long stalk grows;\r\nfrom this time forward the new bell animalcule will never move from the\r\nposition it has chosen. This form of increase, this simple splitting\r\ntakes place over and over again but by degrees the little animal\r\nappears to become exhausted and the process slows down or stops.\r\n\r\nThe partially exhausted _Vorticella_ may gain increased vitality by\r\nfusion with another individual and this process also we may have the\r\nluck to see though it is less frequent than the simple splitting.\r\nSometimes a bell may be observed to divide, not into halves, but\r\ninto two unequal parts. The smaller of these parts may divide again\r\ninto from two to eight parts, each one of which, having developed a\r\nfringe of little whips, swims off on its own account. These little\r\nbarrel-shaped swimming forms, instead of settling down and forming\r\nstalked bells, seek an exhausted creature, fuse with it near the base\r\nof its bell and finally become absorbed by it. The result of this\r\nfusion is that the bell animalcule takes on a new lease of life and\r\nonce more begins to divide actively.\r\n\r\nIn our search for specimens for our microscope we may come across a\r\nvery common pond dweller, closely related to the bell animalcule,\r\nknown by the name of _Carchesium Spectabile_. We cannot fail to\r\nrecognise its family likeness to the form we have already studied, for\r\nit consists of a large number of stalked bells growing on a single\r\nparent stem. It is really a little colony of bells. When one of the\r\nyoung individuals of _Carchesium_ settles down in the spot it has\r\nselected for its dwelling-place, it grows a stalk just as _Vorticella_\r\ndid, and it divides later into two individuals. Now in _Vorticella_\r\nonly the bell divides, in _Carchesium_ part of the stalk divides also\r\nand, instead of swimming away to find a new home it remains attached to\r\nthe parent stalk. When this has happened several times a goodly colony\r\nis formed.\r\n\r\nThere are few fresh-water animals more commonplace and apparently\r\nuninteresting when observed casually than the pond sponge and the river\r\nsponge. Yet, if we take either of them home and examine them with the\r\naid of our microscope, we shall be delighted with our specimens. In\r\nreality they are of absorbing interest and, at certain times of the\r\nyear we may easily obtain young sponges, and capital objects they make\r\nfor the microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photos by Flatters & Garnett_\r\n\r\n  1. STARCH GRAINS OF POTATO\r\n\r\n    Starch is largely used as an adulterant of various foods. The\r\n    Potato starch grain resembles a miniature oyster shell.\r\n\r\n  2. PHOSPHORESCENCE ANIMALCULAE\r\n\r\n    These minute animals, occurring in millions, render sea water\r\n    beautifully phosphorescent.\r\n\r\n  3. PROTEUS ANIMALCULE\r\n\r\n    The lowliest of all animals. It is a jelly-like animal which\r\n    changes its shape from hour to hour.\r\n\r\n  4. CYCLOPS\r\n\r\n    A common one-eyed water animal. The female, illustrated, carries\r\n    her eggs in a pair of relatively large bladder-like sacs.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nBefore we describe our two specimens let us try to explain what manner\r\nof creature a sponge really is. If we examine any bath sponge, we\r\nnotice that it is perforated with many small holes and some larger\r\nones. Some sponges show this better than others. The small holes\r\nare pores, the large ones mouths, but, as we shall see in a moment\r\nwe must not run away with the idea that they in any way resemble\r\nour familiar idea of a mouth. These large holes are called oscula by\r\nscientists, but we wish to avoid scientific words as much as possible.\r\nThe simplest sponge of all, consists of a little bag, which remains\r\naffixed by its base to a seaweed. All over its sides there are many\r\npores and at its tip there is a single osculum; it is known as the\r\nPurse Sponge and is common round our coasts. The inside of the purse\r\nsponge is lined with cells, each one of which is tipped with a little\r\nwhip which waves about unceasingly. The waving of the whip causes water\r\nto flow through all the pores into the hollow bag and out again by way\r\nof the osculum. Although most sponges, including our fresh-water forms,\r\nare much more complicated than the purse sponge, the same thing happens\r\nin them all, water is drawn in by way of the pores and forced out by\r\nway of the oscula.\r\n\r\nThe best place to seek for the fresh water sponges is on the\r\nunder sides of floating wood, broken tree branches and the like.\r\nTheir appearance depends upon whether they have been growing in a\r\nwell-lighted spot or in darkness; they contain chlorophyl as do the\r\nhigher plants, and sponges grown in the light are green, those which\r\nthe light has not reached are buff-coloured or corn-yellow. The pond\r\nsponge is brighter green than its river frequenting relative and is\r\na coarser creature altogether. It often forms little finger-like\r\noutgrowths, whereas the river sponge is more leaflike.\r\n\r\nIf we examine one of these sponges in a watch glass of water to which\r\nwe have added a very little carmine powder, we can easily see the water\r\ncurrents entering the pores and coming from the oscula. Towards autumn,\r\nif we open a river sponge we shall see little yellow bodies about the\r\nsize of a pin’s head; they are the buds from which the young sponges\r\narise. One of these must be removed very carefully and placed in a\r\nwatch glass of water; if our specimen be placed in the sun, we shall\r\nnot have many days to wait before we find that it has given rise to\r\nan active transparent little creature, to a young sponge in fact. By\r\nrepeating our experiment with carmine, by the aid of the microscope, we\r\ncan see the water currents passing through its body.\r\n\r\nWherever we collect our pond water we are certain to find some of the\r\nwheel animalculæ or rotifers. There are such a number of different\r\nkinds that we might describe several, and yet not mention the one that\r\nany of our readers had happened upon. They may be recognised, because\r\nthey are always so transparent that all their internal organs may be\r\nplainly seen and they always have two or more discs or lobes, at their\r\nforward end, fringed with fine whip-like threads. These little threads\r\nare constantly in motion, so that they appear like little revolving\r\nwheels hence the name, wheel animalcule. Nearly all these creatures\r\nhave a sucker or false foot at their tail end by means of which they\r\nattach themselves to some support or they may swim freely in the water.\r\nThe study of rotifers has been the life-work of some scientists and\r\nthey will afford any microscopist, who is interested in them with\r\nabundant occupation.\r\n\r\nAmongst the water weeds we shall probably find another small but\r\nstriking creature, known as the sun animalcule, _Actinophrys Sol_. Why\r\nexactly it is called the sun animalcule we cannot say, probably it has\r\nearned its title from the fact that it resembles the conventional idea\r\nof the sun, with light rays radiating all round its circumference.\r\nThe creature is whitish-grey in colour, spherical in shape and just\r\nvisible to the naked eye. All over the surface of its body there are\r\na number of apparently empty spaces, known as vacuoles--they probably\r\naccount for its peculiar colour. Everywhere, it is studded with long,\r\nslender-pointed rod-like outgrowths. But rarely, the sun animalcule\r\nexhibits any movement and for long periods the only signs that it is\r\nliving occur at feeding time. Its food consists of water animals and\r\nplants, of varying size. When a small animal comes into contact with\r\none of the pointed rods, which radiate from the animalcule, it appears\r\nto be held there in some unaccountable manner and, after a pause, it\r\nbegins a fateful journey by sliding down the rod to the spherical\r\nbody of its captor. Then it is passed into one of the vacuoles and\r\ndigestion very soon takes place. That it does not do so immediately\r\nis shown by the fact that the wheels of a wheel animalcule, which has\r\nbeen passed to the vacuole of our subject, continue their movements\r\nfor a considerable period. When larger animal food is partaken of,\r\na different method is pursued by the sun animalcule. A water-flea,\r\nfor instance, coming into contact with one of the rods will struggle\r\nviolently in its efforts to escape. Then the sun animalcule shows\r\nreal signs of life, for some of the other rods bend over and hold the\r\ncaptive so that it, eventually, is passed to a vacuole.\r\n\r\nIn our chapter on agriculture we mention a peculiar flat worm known as\r\nthe liver fluke. This unpleasant creature has one or two relatives who\r\nmake their home in ponds and, though they are not more beautiful than\r\nthe liver fluke to look upon, they are quite harmless. One of these\r\nflat worms is about 3/4-inch long and not unlike an indian club in\r\nshape. It moves about, with some speed either by the aid of a sucker on\r\nits head or by a curious gliding movement. The other pond-frequenting\r\nflatworm is more like the liver fluke, its leaflike oval body, about\r\n1/2-inch long, is pointed fore and aft. It is a common sight to see it\r\ngliding here and there in search of still smaller animals off which it\r\nmay make a meal.\r\n\r\nThe sea mat and bird’s head, two common animal colonies of the\r\nsea-shore, possess pond-dwelling relatives of the greatest interest\r\nto the microscopist. Like the seaside forms they dwell in colonies.\r\nOne of the commonest is known as _Lophopus Crystallinus_ and it may\r\nbe found attached to duckweed, the curious little plant whose tiny\r\nleaves float upon the surface of the water. _Lophopus_, when at rest,\r\nresembles a little piece of jelly. If we are patient and watch it\r\nunder our microscope we shall see it expand, sending forth a number of\r\nstalks, each one tipped with a horse-shoe shaped feathery tentacle.\r\nEach of these tentacles belongs to a separate animal which with its\r\nfellows forms a colony. Not so interesting are the branched, threadlike\r\ncolonies of _Plumatella Repens_ which may be sought upon the leaves of\r\nwater plants. Our ponds can furnish no more extraordinary object for\r\nour microscope than a colony of _Cristatella Mucedo_; it is curious in\r\nappearance and still more curious from the fact that though a colony\r\nof animals it acts like a single individual in crawling over the weeds\r\nand stones in shallow, sun-kissed water. The _Cristatella_ colony is\r\njelly-like and greenish in colour, in length it may grow to a couple\r\nof inches. Its under surface is flat, whilst from its upper, convex\r\nsurface the little animals forming the colony wave their brush-like\r\ntentacles in the water.\r\n\r\nIn searching the various pond weeds for specimens we are sure to\r\nmeet with various jelly-like masses; these must always be examined\r\ncarefully. They may be the egg-masses of interesting water creatures;\r\nvarious water-snails, for instance, protect their eggs with a\r\njelly-like covering.\r\n\r\nIf we meet with any large fresh-water mussels, sometimes called swan\r\nmussels, we shall probably find the fleshy parts of the molluscs\r\nswarming with minute creatures, which we may conclude are parasites.\r\nMussels, like nearly all living creatures, have their parasites it is\r\ntrue, but what we have discovered will almost certainly prove to be\r\nyoung mussels. We must examine them under the microscope to make sure.\r\nThen we shall see, if young mussels they be, very minute and very\r\nthin-shelled little creatures; the edges of their shells are armed with\r\nteeth and are quite unlike the highly polished and smooth shells of the\r\nparent mussel. We shall also see a long thread issuing from the animal\r\nwithin the shell. If we are examining the young mussel in water we\r\nshall notice that it is constantly snapping its two shells together.\r\n\r\nHad we left these young mussels undisturbed, a very curious life they\r\nwould have led. They would have remained attached to their parent for\r\nsome little time probably, or some of them might have fallen to the\r\nmuddy bed of the pond. Their behaviour in either case would be the\r\nsame. The long threads that we have already examined would have floated\r\nin the water and, directly they were touched by a passing fish, the\r\nlittle shells would begin to snap violently. The lucky ones would not\r\nsnap in vain for they would close upon the fin or tail of the fish and\r\nthen their snapping would cease. Like the bulldog, these little mussels\r\nmay take a long time in getting hold but when once they have managed\r\nto fasten their teeth into anything it is well-nigh impossible to make\r\nthem let go. Usually they never let go, but are carried away by the\r\nfish. In most cases, the irritation they set up in the flesh of their\r\nnew-found foster parent causes a swelling to occur with the result that\r\nthe little mussels are engulfed. Within the flesh of the fish they go\r\nthrough a series of changes; they lose their teeth and their tell-tale\r\nthread, they become in fact miniatures of the adult mussels, then they\r\nmanage to escape from the fish, settle down in the mud and fend for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe crabs and lobsters which we know so well have fresh water relatives\r\nin nearly every pond. Many of the creatures we have examined have\r\nneeded careful search to discover their whereabouts; not so the fresh\r\nwater crustacea, as they are called. Their activity, their curious\r\nmovements in the water compel attention.\r\n\r\nThe fresh water shrimp is a curious little creature, sometimes he\r\npaddles his three pairs of hind legs and sometimes he jerks his body in\r\na ludicrous manner, in either case he manages to propel himself rapidly\r\nthrough the water. He is about half an inch long, brown in colour and\r\nwith a curved body not unlike a shrimp. If we examine him under the\r\nmicroscope we notice that his front legs are bent forwards, whilst his\r\nhind legs are bent backwards. The male water flea is much larger than\r\nthe female, a fact which probably accounts for the fact that these\r\nlittle animals often carry their wives about with them by seizing them\r\nwith their fore legs.\r\n\r\nThe water louse we may also encounter, he is not nearly so interesting\r\nas the fresh water shrimp. He is closely related to the wood louse\r\nwhich we all know, and has a similar flattened body.\r\n\r\nVery much smaller though even more interesting is the common water\r\nflea. By day these animals retire to the mud at the bottom of the pond\r\nbut, morning and evening, they swim actively with a curious jerky\r\nmotion. We must examine our specimen carefully for he is of more than\r\nordinary interest. We cannot fail to observe how transparent he is,\r\nso much so that all his internal organs can be plainly seen, but let\r\nus deal with his exterior first of all. His large eyes are plainly\r\nvisible, but his most conspicuous feature is the pair of large branched\r\nfeelers, by means of which he swims. If we examine several specimens,\r\none or more is certain to be a female, then we may probably observe\r\nan egg in process of formation in the brood pouch, a large, elongated\r\ncavity, just below the back of the animal. Immediately above the brood\r\npouch, the heart is situated and, if we can induce its owner to keep\r\nstill for a moment or two, the heart-beats may be plainly seen.\r\n\r\nNot unlike the water flea as it swims about in the water of our\r\ncollecting jar is the curious, transparent little creature known as\r\n_Cypris_. Although so transparent its body is contained in a pair of\r\nshells, very similar to those of the mussel; a fact which formerly\r\nled to its being classed with the shell-fish. We may well examine\r\nthis little fellow under the microscope for much of his structure may\r\nbe made out through his shell. His very conspicuous eye is sure to\r\nattract our attention; he possesses but a single eye and seems to make\r\nup for the lack of a second by having a very large one. Two pairs of\r\nfeelers project beyond the shell in front. Of his two pairs of legs the\r\nforemost, or at least their tips, hang down below the shell, but the\r\nlast pair, as we can see through the shell, are turned upwards. At the\r\nhinder end of the body, there are two long bristles, they may best be\r\nseen when _Cypris_ is swimming. Of what use exactly these bristles may\r\nbe to their owner is not definitely known, but it is thought that they\r\nare of service in keeping his shell clean.\r\n\r\nAnother active little animal, quite as common as the water flea, is\r\nsure to attract our attention. It is no larger than the water flea\r\nbut much more elongated; some specimens are bigger than others, and\r\nthe bigger ones are the females. Its name is _Cyclops_ and, though so\r\ncommon, it has no popular name.\r\n\r\n_Cyclops_ is so named on account of the fact that it possesses but a\r\nsingle eye; it is, however, rather an interesting creature in other\r\nrespects, so we will study it more closely. Looking down upon the\r\ncreature, we see that the front part of its body is composed of an\r\nundivided shield, behind which there are four plates and behind these\r\nagain there are in the male five and in the female four segments or\r\nrings, at the extreme tip there is a forked tail, each fork being\r\nfurnished with a number of bristles. On the head are two pairs of\r\norgans, one pair long the other pair short and, if we observe _Cyclops_\r\nin the act of swimming, we shall see that the long pair of organs\r\nplay the chief part. In the centre of the front of the head there\r\nis a black or red patch--the eye. Very frequently we may meet with a\r\nspecimen carrying a relatively large bladder-like body on each side of\r\nits abdomen. These bladders which are each about one-third as long as\r\nthe creature which carries them, are egg-sacs.\r\n\r\nIf we are able to secure one or two specimens with egg-sacs attached,\r\nwe can study the young _Cyclops_ without much difficulty. Take\r\na small glass tube--a test-tube as used by chemists will serve\r\nadmirably--partly fill it with pond water and add a little water weed,\r\nthen introduce the egg-bearing females and place in the light. We must\r\nwatch the tube from day to day, and before long it will be evident\r\nthat the young ones have arrived in the world, for we shall have no\r\ndifficulty in seeing dozens of little white specks swimming about in\r\nthe water and settling on the sides of the tube. We must remove one\r\ncarefully on the end of a glass rod or on a paint brush and examine\r\nit in a drop of water under the microscope. This young creature is\r\ntotally unlike its parent, it is oval and possesses three pairs of\r\nstiff bristles, of which the first pair are simple and the other two\r\npairs are branched. Although the bristles are used solely for swimming\r\nat this stage, it may be of interest to mention that in the adult\r\n_Cyclops_ they become transformed into jaws and the two pairs of organs\r\nwe have already examined. At the front end of the oval body we can\r\nclosely distinguish the single eye, which persists throughout life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPLANT LIFE IN PONDS AND STREAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we shall confine ourselves to the true water-dwelling\r\nplants, as distinct from those, such as the water lilies, which though\r\nnever found growing on dry land, appear undecided whether they will\r\nbe water plants or land plants. Looking at the matter from a more\r\nscientific point of view, all our pond plants will be much lower in the\r\nscale of development than the water lilies and other flowering plants.\r\n\r\nPond life is rich in subjects for the microscopist. Any stagnant\r\npool may contain organisms which will delight the naturalist who has\r\nalways depended upon his unaided vision. Curiously enough, amongst\r\nthe most wonderful of all these pond-dwelling plants are the Diatoms,\r\nwhich consist of but a single cell. They are so numerous, they exist\r\nin so many different forms and in so many different situations that\r\nwere we able to describe them all, we should require the whole of a\r\nlarge volume, much larger than this. In colour, Diatoms are usually\r\nbrown or brownish, although they contain chlorophyll, the green\r\ncolouring matter of higher plants. In shape they may be rod-shaped,\r\ncrescent-shaped, circular, wedge-shaped, oblong or oval. Some float\r\nabout freely in the water, some are attached to supports by means\r\nof stalks. Some lead a solitary life and others dwell together in\r\ncolonies. One feature they have in common, a curious flinty cell wall,\r\nand this is their most interesting point to the microscopist. This\r\nnatural armour is in two parts which fit one within the other like the\r\ntwo halves of a Japanese basket. All manner of beautiful sculpturing\r\nmarks these beautiful frustules as they are called; in some cases they\r\nare perforated and the living matter from within passes through the\r\npores and forms a jelly-like covering for the little plant.\r\n\r\nWe must make a point of collecting all the Diatoms we can find, for\r\nthey are always interesting; moreover, they are easily preserved and\r\nmade into permanent slides, for the little plants may be boiled in\r\nacid to destroy their living parts and the frustules will survive the\r\nboiling undamaged.\r\n\r\nOne might wonder how such humble plants, surrounded as they are with\r\nflinty walls, could increase. They frequently do so in a simple manner.\r\nThe living matter of which the plant is composed pushes the frustules\r\napart and divides across the middle. The result of this event is the\r\nformation of two plants, each with a single frustule. In a very short\r\ntime each plant grows a new frustule, but it is always much smaller\r\nthan the one with which it started.\r\n\r\nThe movements of some of the free swimming, that is to say non-attached\r\nDiatoms, are worthy of study. The scientific name of one kind,\r\ntranslated into everyday language, means little boats, and indeed they\r\nare well named for their beautiful aquatic manœuvres rival those of any\r\nship.\r\n\r\nSomewhat similar in habit to the brown Diatoms are the green Desmids,\r\nbut, whereas, the former also occur in the sea, the latter are all\r\nconfined to fresh water. Sometimes Desmids are so numerous that\r\nthey make the pond water as green as green-pea soup. It would be as\r\nimpossible to describe all these plants as was the case with the\r\nDiatoms, but generally they may be recognised by the fact that they are\r\ncomposed of two similar halves, separated by more or less of a waist.\r\nAlthough some of the Desmids exhibit a certain amount of movement they\r\nare not active like the Diatoms.\r\n\r\nLate spring and autumn are the best seasons to hunt the ponds\r\nfor our next object, which rejoices in the name _Chlamydomonas\r\nAngulosa_, a good example of the extraordinary fact that some of\r\nthe smallest animals and plants have the longest names. This little\r\nplant is interesting in itself and doubly so, because it was for\r\nlong thought to be an animal; it is wonderfully animal-like in its\r\nmovements. _Chlamydomonas_ is very minute, so we must use our highest\r\nmagnification when we examine it. It is an oval, one-celled plant\r\nenclosed in a clear membrane. The green colouring matter is arranged in\r\nthe form of a cup, within the hollow of which is a mass of granular\r\nliving substance. At the forward end of the plant, there is a clear\r\nspace and near the tip a brownish dot, known as the eye spot; which,\r\nthough incapable of seeing as we understand it, is sensitive to light,\r\nas shown by the fact that the little plant will swim towards moderately\r\nintense light and away from strong light. If we stain the plant with\r\niodine we can plainly see a pair of little whips arising from the clear\r\nportion at the forward end; it is by the lashing of these that the\r\nplant is enabled to swim.\r\n\r\nIn the mud of our pond we may find a little colony of plants which\r\nmight forgivably be mistaken for a collection of the individuals we\r\nhave just studied. Each member of the colony is very much smaller\r\nthan _Chlamydomonas_ to be sure, but each one has the outer membrane,\r\nthe brownish eye spot and the pair of little whips. On the other hand\r\nthe chlorophyll fills the whole of each cell and is not arranged in\r\nthe form of a cup. Sixteen cells form a colony, and the whole mass is\r\na flat plate; the little whips move in unison and the whole colony\r\nrevolves after the manner of a wheel.\r\n\r\nAnother little colony we may encounter also, consists likewise of\r\nsixteen cells very like the ones we have described, but somewhat\r\nwedge-shaped instead of oval. A jelly-like mantle encloses the colony\r\nand, in outline, it is spherical, so that when the little whips, which\r\nproject through the mantle, lash the water the whole colony revolves.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of these colonies of cells is known as _Volvox\r\nGlobator_, it may be recognised by its perfectly spherical shape and\r\nits characteristic movements in water. _Volvox_ is about 1/25 inch in\r\ndiameter, and although to the uninitiated it appears to be a single\r\nminute plant, in reality it is a colony of upwards of twenty thousand\r\ncells. The colony may be considered as being made up of thousands upon\r\nthousands of cells, very similar to those of _Chlamydomonas_, and each\r\none arranged with its pair of little whips directed outwards.\r\n\r\nWithin the _Volvox_ sphere we may observe a number, usually one to\r\neight, of smaller spheres. These are so-called daughter colonies which\r\nhave arisen from the continued division of special cells. They develop,\r\nfairly rapidly, into young _Volvox_ colonies, then they burst through\r\nthe cells of the parent colony, swim out into the water and quickly\r\ngrow to the size of the _Volvox_ from which they were formed.\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of _Volvox_ of a yellowish colour and much\r\nsmaller than _Globator_, the big one is the one we must procure; it is\r\nmuch more easily studied.\r\n\r\nCertain of the plants we shall find in our pond are so animal-like in\r\ntheir movements, that the microscopist who sees them for the first\r\ntime may wonder whether we are not mistaken in calling them plants. We\r\nhave already described the common _Chlamydomonas_, with its curious\r\njerky method of propelling itself through the water. There is,\r\nhowever, an equally common one-celled, pond-frequenting plant which\r\nhas puzzled naturalists even more, for it certainly possesses many\r\nvery animal-like characteristics. Its name is _Euglena Viridis_ and\r\nwe require our highest magnification to examine it for it does not\r\nexceed one-two hundred and fiftieth part of an inch in length. Usually,\r\n_Euglena_ is cigar-shaped but, as it possesses the very unplant-like\r\ncharacteristic of not having a firm cell wall it can change its shape\r\nto a considerable extent and it often assumes curious forms. At the\r\nforward end of this minute plant there is a single whip-like thread, by\r\nmeans of which it swims; a little below the base of the whip, there is\r\na red eye spot. Elsewhere we have described how the protean animalcule\r\nfeeds by flowing round its food-material, _Euglena_ feeds in a similar\r\nmanner, but it also feeds after the manner of a plant. When this active\r\nlittle plant is about to increase it either divides into two lengthways\r\nor becomes surrounded with a firm wall within which it breaks up into a\r\nnumber of young forms which are released later by the bursting of the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photos by Flatters & Garnett_\r\n\r\n  1.

Two threads are shown fusing\r\n    together; from each part of these fused threads a new plant will\r\n    arise.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nSmall wonder that scientists were in doubt concerning the true nature\r\nof _Euglena_, its non-walled cell and peculiar mode of feeding are\r\nindeed puzzling. There are many similar cases amongst these lowly\r\norganisms, in fact there are some creatures which may best be described\r\nas partly plant and partly animal. Those of our readers who are\r\ninterested in such problems may read an excellent account given much\r\nmore fully than we could give it here, in Professor F. W. Keeble’s\r\n_Plant Animals_, one of the excellent Cambridge Manuals of Science.\r\nThe fact is that the demarcation between plants and animals, low in\r\nthe scale of development, is not nearly so pronounced as it is amongst\r\nthe higher forms of life. Amongst the plants of our pond we shall find\r\nthat, like the land plants, most of them are green, and many of them\r\nare thread-like, so that the task of distinguishing one from another\r\nmay appear difficult. Examined with the naked eye, many of them appear\r\nremarkably similar to one another; under the microscope the differences\r\nare obvious.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable of the commoner pond plants is known as\r\n_Oscillatoria_; it does not boast of a popular name but its scientific\r\nname is not very difficult to remember after we have witnessed its\r\noscillations. _Oscillatoria_ is a plant with particularly animal-like\r\nmovements. It is merely a thread, usually green-blue in colour, but\r\nsometimes red or violet. The threads are never branched and, except\r\nwhen in motion, are straight. Under a moderately high magnification we\r\ncan see that this thread-like plant is not composed of a single cell\r\nbut that it consists of a number of cells, placed end to end. Sometimes\r\na few of these cells will break away and start life on their own\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nWhatever interest the structure of _Oscillatoria_ may have for us, we\r\ncannot help being struck with its movements, and we must make a point\r\nof observing them. The movement is peculiar and not easy to describe\r\nnor, so far as we know, has it ever been explained. A thread will be\r\nseen to glide backwards and forwards, becoming somewhat curved and,\r\nat the same time, revolving on its axis. Eel-like is perhaps a good\r\ndescription of the movement. It is possible to distinguish this plant\r\nfrom other pond dwellers by its slimy “feel” which arises from the fact\r\nthat each thread is enclosed in a jelly-like sheath.\r\n\r\nThe silk weeds, _Cladophora Glomerata_ are somewhat similar in\r\nappearance to the plant we have just described, but they are denizens\r\nof running streams rather than of ponds. They are the green thread-like\r\nplants we so often see attached by one end to rocks and stones beneath\r\nrunning water. Each plant consists of a long, cylindrical structure\r\ncomposed of several cells. We mention the silk weeds here, because they\r\nare best of all plants for showing cell growth. This growth takes place\r\nat or near the unattached end of the plant and is easily observed. The\r\nend cell may be watched for the process. Its green contents will be\r\nobserved to contract in the middle so that it assumes an hour-glass\r\nshape. Then, where the contraction has taken place, we can watch the\r\nformation of a wall right across the cell, so that when the process is\r\ncompleted we have two cells where formerly there was one. More rarely,\r\nthe contents of a cell will be observed to bulge out a side wall, then\r\na new wall is formed to divide it off from the main cell and thus the\r\nbeginning of a branch is formed. The silk weeds exhibit no movements,\r\nexcept such as are imparted to them by the running water.\r\n\r\nA very beautiful little pond plant is known to science as _Draparnalda\r\nGlomerata_. We shall probably forget its name, but we can never forget\r\nthe plant itself when once we have been fortunate enough to see it.\r\nA single row of large, transparent cells, containing very little\r\ngreen colouring matter, forms the main part of the plant. At regular\r\nintervals from these transparent cells, there arise rings of deep green\r\nbranches, each one tipped with an extraordinarily long, colourless\r\nhair. _Draparnalda_ is indeed a plant worth looking for.\r\n\r\nTwo common little green plants grow so near to the edges of ponds that\r\nthey may well be included amongst our pond plants. The simpler of the\r\ntwo, known as _Vaucheria Sessilis_ thrives on almost any damp soil and\r\nmay even form a covering on soil in pots. In structure, _Vaucheria_ is\r\nvery simple for it consists of a single, frequently branched, tubular\r\ncell. The little attaching organ, by means of which the plant fixes\r\nitself to some firm support, is colourless, so too is the tip of the\r\ncell where growth takes place.\r\n\r\nWe must examine this little plant when we come across it and we must\r\nnot fail to notice that it is composed of but one cell. The only time\r\nat which we can find any cross walls, is when _Vaucheria_ is about to\r\nincrease. Then the tip of the cell swells, like a little club, and a\r\ncross wall separates it from the rest of the plant. The contents of\r\nthis cell rounds itself off, becomes fringed with innumerable little\r\nlashing whips and escapes from a pore at the tip of the cell in which\r\nit was formed. This little organism swims about for a time in the\r\nwater, for _Vaucheria_ only increases in this manner when it is under\r\nwater, at length it comes to rest and forms a new plant.\r\n\r\nClosely related to _Vaucheria_, but not quite so common, is the curious\r\nlittle plant known as _Botrydium Granulatum_. Like our previous\r\nexample, it is a one-celled plant and herein lies its interest. When\r\nfind a specimen growing by a pond, we shall notice a green bladderlike\r\nportion, not more than 1/6 inch in diameter, which projects above the\r\nground. Below ground, if we pick the soil away carefully we may observe\r\na number of colourless, branched structures which do duty for roots.\r\nThe bladder and underground portions are hollow, being lined in the\r\ncase of the former, with a network of chlorophyll beautiful to observe\r\nunder the microscope.\r\n\r\n_Botrydium_ usually increases by buds which form on the green bladder,\r\nbreak away and grow into new plants. Should the level of the water in\r\nthe pond rise, and the little plant become submerged, it splits up into\r\na number of small bodies, each provided with a minute whip-like organ,\r\nwith which they swim rapidly ashore where they develop into new plants.\r\nIn dry weather the plant forms a number of little cells each one\r\nsurrounded by a firm cell wall. When moisture comes again these little\r\ncells give rise to structures which will grow into new plants.\r\n\r\nSurpassing even _Drapernalda Glomerata_ in point of beauty, is the\r\n“water-net,” _Hydrodictyon Reticulatum_, but it is not nearly so\r\ncommon, being confined to ponds in the South and Midlands. When full\r\ngrown it hardly comes under the heading of a microscopic object, for it\r\nmay measure as much as six inches in length. This remarkable pond plant\r\nconsists of an open network of green filaments. Apart from its striking\r\nappearance the most remarkable thing about the “water net” is its rapid\r\ngrowth. Carpenter, a noted microscopist says:--“The original cells of\r\nwhich the net is composed measure one-two thousand five hundredth part\r\nof an inch in length but in a few hours they grow to one-twelfth of an\r\ninch or 1/3 of an inch in length. We often hear people remark that they\r\ncan see plants grow, but their statements are not literally true; in\r\nthe case of the ‘water net’ it is actually possible to see the growth.”\r\n\r\nBy the side of our pond we shall probably observe some masses of a\r\nbluish-green jelly-like substance. It is uninteresting-looking material\r\nfor the microscope, but we must not pass it by. The blue-green jelly\r\nencloses a plant called _Nostoc_, which resembles nothing so much as a\r\nnecklace of beads; this we can plainly see under a low magnification.\r\nWe shall observe that the plant is twisted spirally within its covering\r\nand also that most of the cells, which we have compared to beads, are\r\nsimilar to one another in size. At intervals there are larger cells\r\nand as the plant increases in length they are emptied periodically, so\r\nthey are evidently used as food stores. From time to time portions of\r\nthe plant break away, worm their way out of the jelly and move about,\r\nrather after the manner of a worm. Eventually, these wanderers come\r\nto rest and become surrounded with more of the blue-green jelly, thus\r\nforming a new _Nostoc_ colony.\r\n\r\nThese plants sometimes appear, apparently from nowhere, on garden\r\npaths, walls and similar situations, during damp autumn weather.\r\nOn this account the plants have been called “fallen stars.” Their\r\nappearance is not so mysterious as it might seem for the _Nostoc_\r\ncolony has probably been where it is found, all through the summer,\r\nin a dried up, contracted state. Only when rain comes, does the jelly\r\nenvelope absorb water, swell up and assume its normal appearance. The\r\nblue-green scum which floats on stagnant water is a closely related\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nAnother plant which looks like scum on the water is known as\r\n_Spirogyra_ and a very beautiful object it makes for the microscope.\r\nIt is bright green, without a bluish tinge, so it need not be confused\r\nwith the plant we have just mentioned. There are seventy or so\r\ndifferent kinds of _Spirogyra_, therefore our description must be the\r\none that will apply to all. The plant is thread-like and, even in the\r\nlarger kinds, the threads are not more than one-hundredth part of an\r\ninch in diameter. Like _Oscillatoria_ the plants are not attached to\r\nany support. Each thread is composed of many cells, arranged end to\r\nend; we can distinguish the cell walls clearly, but what will chiefly\r\nattract our attention are the beautiful bands of green colouring\r\nmatter, running spirally, round each cell. If we are fortunate, we\r\nshall see the plant in the act of increasing; this is not the simple\r\noperation we witnessed in the silk weeds. From two threads lying\r\nparallel to one another, we shall see swellings arise on the adjacent\r\ncell walls; the beautiful spiral bands will begin to break up at the\r\nsame time and to collect in a mass towards the centre of each cell.\r\nThe swellings of adjacent cells touch, their end walls break down so\r\nthat the two cells become connected, our figure shows the fusion taking\r\nplace, then the contents of one cell passes into the adjacent cell and\r\nfuses with the contents of the latter. The new cell, which now contains\r\nnot only its original contents but that from a cell in another plant,\r\nbecomes detached from the thread, assumes an oval shape and sinks to\r\nthe bottom of the pond, where it rests awhile. At a later period the\r\ncell wall bursts and a new thread of _Spirogyra_ develops from it.\r\n\r\nWhen we are examining _Spirogyra_ we may notice some very minute\r\nbrick-red, spherical bodies adhering to the green threads. These are\r\nlittle pond animals, known by the name of _Vampyrella Spirogyræ_. This\r\nlittle creature passes through an interesting and easily observed\r\nseries of changes. Its life is very uneventful, consisting of a good\r\nmeal of _Spirogyra_, a period of rest followed by an increase, and\r\nthis is repeated over and over again. If we watch our little sphere\r\nthrough the microscope, we may be lucky enough to see the contents\r\ndivide into four parts. Now we must watch carefully, for very\r\ninteresting events are about to take place. Each of the four parts into\r\nwhich the contents of the sphere has split, escapes into the water\r\nand swims about for a time; it then becomes spherical, but instead of\r\nhaving a smooth outer surface, as it had when we first observed it,\r\nwe can see that it is now studded all over with very fine threads. It\r\nthen wanders along a _Spirogyra_ plant, attaches itself to one of the\r\ncells, perforates its wall and sucks out the contents. This performance\r\nit repeats several times then, evidently satiated, it loses its threads\r\nand resumes the appearance it had when first observed and thus it\r\nrests, till division of its contents into four parts takes place once\r\nmore and the little comedy is repeated.\r\n\r\nNow we must tear ourselves away from our pond; there are very many\r\ninteresting objects for our microscope on the sea shore and if we delay\r\ntoo long here, we shall not be able to give them the attention they\r\ndeserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE MICROSCOPE AND PLANT LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe science of botany consists of many branches and, in most of\r\nthem, the microscope is the scientist’s constant aid. The study of\r\nbacteria, really a branch of botany, we have dealt with in another\r\nchapter, so here we will omit these interesting though lowly plants.\r\nBy far the number of botanical objects for the microscope consist\r\nof sections--exceedingly thin slices of whatever portion of the\r\nplant is being examined, cut either with a sharp razor or a special\r\ninstrument called a microtome. Section cutting, though not a difficult\r\naccomplishment, requires a considerable amount of practice and cannot\r\nbe learned from a book; all our descriptions, therefore, will be\r\nconfined to objects from the plant world which may be studied without\r\nthe assistance of razor or microtome.\r\n\r\nOne cannot help being struck with the fact that green is the prevailing\r\ncolour among plants and the reason is not far to seek. If we take a\r\ncabbage leaf and carefully tear off the skin, we shall find green\r\nspongy matter below. A little of this green material may be examined\r\nunder the microscope and will show us rounded green bodies composed\r\nof a substance called chlorophyll. Now chlorophyll is absolutely\r\nnecessary to all plants, except the fungi and to one or two parasitic\r\nplants. It is necessary because, by its aid, plants can build up raw\r\nfood material into food which will be useful to them. It is not formed\r\nin darkness; that is why a board, a roller or any similar object left\r\non a lawn, causes the grass below to turn yellow; it is the reason\r\nalso why certain parts of plants, not usually green, turn that colour\r\nwhen exposed to the light. Chlorophyll does not always occur in round\r\nglobules, sometimes it is found in bands.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting botanical studies for the microscope is\r\nfurnished by the leaf of the American water-weed. This plant, which was\r\nintroduced into the country from North America some years ago, has now\r\nspread far and wide and is easily obtained. A leaf which is slightly\r\nyellowed with age is the best to take for the experiment. It should\r\nbe cut from the plant, placed at once in a small bottle of water and\r\nkept warm for a few hours; this may be accomplished by keeping the\r\nbottle in one’s pocket. After a sufficient interval, put a drop of\r\nwater in a clean slide, put the portion of leaf in the drop of water,\r\ncover with a coverslip and examine with a moderately high power. If the\r\nexperiment has been properly carried out a wonderful sight will reward\r\nus. We shall see that the leaf is divided into a number of divisions\r\ncalled cells; this name has been handed down from the very early days\r\nof the microscope, because of a supposed resemblance to the cells in\r\na bee’s honey comb. In each cell we shall see signs of activity, the\r\nlittle round grains of chlorophyll are there, but instead of being\r\nstationary, as in the cabbage leaf, they are slowly moving round the\r\nwalls of each cell. In reality they are carried along in the stream of\r\nliving matter within the cell. It is a wonderful sight and brings home\r\nto the observer very forcibly a fact which is liable to be forgotten,\r\nthat the plant is just as much a living being as an animal. Perhaps\r\nour experiment will not succeed at the first attempt, then we must try\r\nagain; maybe we have been too rough in detaching the leaf or we have\r\nnot kept it sufficiently warm. Sometimes the movement may be started by\r\nslightly warming the slide over a flame; too much heat, of course, will\r\nkill the leaf.\r\n\r\nWe shall see this green colouring matter over and over again in our\r\nbotanical studies, in fact it is found in all manner of situations,\r\nin leaf and stem. Very often its colour is hidden by sap of another\r\ncolour, as for instance in copper beech leaves or in the brown\r\nseaweeds. Chlorophyll dissolves in alcohol, however, and this affords\r\nus a ready means of detecting its presence though we cannot see its\r\ngreen colour. If we boil any leaf, suspected of containing chlorophyll,\r\nin alcohol we shall obtain a solution with rather peculiar properties\r\nbecause, when held up to the light it appears green, but when light is\r\nreflected from it, it appears reddish.\r\n\r\nFrom the under side of the cabbage leaf whence we obtained our first\r\nspecimen of chlorophyll, we must now take another piece of skin. If\r\nwe perform the operation properly the skin will be colourless, like\r\na piece of thin parchment; any green colour will show that we have\r\ntorn off more than the skin and we must make another attempt. Having\r\nsecured our piece of skin we place it in a drop of water on a clean\r\nslide and examine it under the microscope. We first notice that the\r\nskin is divided up into a number of small areas called cells and dotted\r\nhere and there amongst the cells are several oval bodies, containing\r\nchlorophyll. These oval bodies are the pores through which the leaf\r\nbreathes, amongst other things. In the centre of each pore there is\r\na hole, at least there is if the pore is open, for the two cells\r\ncomprising the pore have the power of opening and closing.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to try the same experiment with a fern leaf and to\r\nnotice that there are pores, very similar to those of the cabbage, but\r\nthat the walls bounding the cells of the leaf are irregular and that\r\nthey contain chlorophyll. We may try several other leaves and also the\r\nupper and lower surfaces of leaves, then we shall soon learn that, in\r\nleaves with distinct upper and lower surfaces, there are far more pores\r\non the lower than the upper surface; leaves like those of the iris have\r\nalmost the same number on each side, and floating leaves, like those of\r\nwater lily have all their pores on the upper side. There is a reason\r\nfor this; the pores are likely to become filled with dust, being on the\r\nlower side they are protected somewhat; flat leaves, by their shape,\r\nafford no protection and floating leaves must have their pores on the\r\nupper surface to obtain air.\r\n\r\nThere are many other interesting things we may learn about leaves, with\r\nthe help of our microscope. The cabbage leaf is quite smooth, but if we\r\nare observant we shall have noticed that sometimes each leaf appears\r\nas though it had been powdered, it has a decided bloom. The bloom does\r\nnot appear on the leaf for ornament but for a purpose. It is a waxy\r\nsubstance and it prevents the leaf from losing moisture too quickly\r\nin dry weather. This is very important for the plant; if the moisture\r\ntaken up from the soil were lost in the air too quickly by the leaves,\r\nthe plants would wither and eventually die. It is not all plants which\r\ncan wear a protective covering when danger threatens, most plants have\r\neither no protection or are permanently protected. There is a large\r\nclass of plants with folded or rolled leaves; heather and marram grass\r\nbelong to this class. We must examine some of these leaves and we shall\r\nfind that all the pores are on the inside of the leaf whether it be\r\nfolded or rolled. The reason for this is that moisture also escapes\r\nthrough the pores and, when they are thus protected, it is not carried\r\noff too quickly by drying winds.\r\n\r\nMany plants are protected, as far as their leaves are concerned, at\r\nanyrate, by hairs. They take the place of the bloom in such plants as\r\nthe cabbage. There are thousands of plants with hairy leaves and they\r\nwill provide as many interesting objects for our microscope. Let us\r\nexamine as many as we can for the hairy covering of each plant will\r\nbe a little different to the one we examined previously. There are\r\nsimple hairs, quite ordinary affairs, forked hairs, branched hairs,\r\nT-shaped, star-shaped and club-shaped hairs. If we are clever with our\r\nmicroscope we shall notice that, however complex each hair may be it is\r\nreally nothing but one cell of the skin of the leaf which has assumed a\r\npeculiar shape.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the nettle are armed with ordinary and stinging hairs;\r\nthe latter are worth examining and we shall notice that there is one\r\ngreat difference between all the other hairs we have examined and\r\nthe stinging hairs of the nettle. The former are of one cell only,\r\nthe latter of several cells. A high magnification will show that the\r\nstinging hair of the nettle is not quite so simple as it appears at\r\nfirst sight.\r\n\r\nThere are plants whose leaves are protected by very thick skins and\r\nothers whose leaves become armed with hard flinty matter, so that they\r\nresemble stones rather than leaves.\r\n\r\nIf we can find some quite young seedlings we must manage to secure one\r\nor more for examination under our microscope. We must take one up very\r\ncarefully and wash the earth from its roots--if we pull the earth away\r\nour specimen will be ruined. Near the tips of the root branches we\r\nshall see something which might be mistaken for mould. Our microscope\r\nwill show us that they belong to the root; they are, in fact, root\r\nhairs. We shall very likely be able to make out that, like the leaf\r\nhairs, each root hair is made up of a single cell. The root hairs are\r\ninteresting because it is through them that water is taken up by the\r\nplant from the soil.\r\n\r\nIn many plants a considerable space separates the root from the leaves.\r\nWhen we have learned how to cut sections, we can make slides for our\r\nmicroscope which will show us the whole course along which the water\r\ntravels, from its point of entry at a root hair to its exit at a leaf\r\npore. Although we have not yet reached that stage, it need not prevent\r\nus from seeing some of the minute tubes through which the water passes.\r\nAny fleshy stemmed plant will serve our purpose. We must tear it to\r\npieces lengthways with a needle and we shall find many threads--this is\r\nnot their correct name but it expresses our meaning--running the whole\r\nlength of the stem. They run, in fact, from the tips of the root to the\r\nleaf, and may be seen as leaf veins. If we remove one of these threads\r\nand tease it with needles on a slide we shall reduce it to still\r\nfiner threads. By the way, teasing in the sense we have used it here,\r\nmeans separating the various parts. Let us examine some of these fine\r\nthreads, we shall see that some of them appear like coiled springs at\r\nfirst glance. A more careful examination will show us long tubes with\r\nspiral thickenings. We all know the garden hose-pipe with stout wire\r\ncoiled round it as a protection; these tubes may clearly be compared\r\nwith the familiar hose-pipe, where the rubber portion represents the\r\ncell wall and the stout wire the thickened parts of the wall. There is,\r\nhowever, this great difference, the wire is outside the hose-pipe, the\r\nthickened portion of the plant tube is inside the wall. These tubes are\r\nthe ducts for water passing from root to leaf.\r\n\r\nIf the agricultural side of botany attracts us we shall not have much\r\ndifficulty in finding many more objects from the fungus world than are\r\nmentioned in our chapter on Agriculture, whilst the study of bacteria\r\nmay truthfully be termed never ending. Ponds and rivers teem with\r\nvegetation suitable for microscopic study. The testing of foods for\r\nimpurities is largely botanical work. The botanist, of all men, need\r\nnever allow his microscope to be idle.\r\n\r\nOur British insectivorous plants are of great interest and they will\r\nsupply us with some objects for our microscope. We only possess\r\nthree different kinds of these curious plants in this country, the\r\nBladderworts which live in water and the Sundews and Butterwort, which\r\nfrequent moist, peaty land.\r\n\r\nThe pond-dwelling Bladderworts are not rare, indeed they occur in\r\nplenty in certain localities, but they are not very evenly distributed\r\nover the country and in some districts one may search for them in vain.\r\nIt is worth while making a special effort to obtain a specimen. Each\r\nplant bears a number of hollow structures, the bladders. There is an\r\nentrance to each bladder, edged with stiff hairs and closed by a trap\r\ndoor, which opens inwards but will not open outwards. All these parts\r\nmay be seen under the microscope as may the interior of a bladder; its\r\nwalls are studded with short hairs. When small water animals enter a\r\nbladder, it is said that they do so to escape from their enemies; they\r\nare entrapped forever, they die and eventually decay. The juices which\r\narise from their decaying bodies are absorbed by the hairs lining the\r\nbladder.\r\n\r\nThe Sundews are pretty plants, with rosettes of reddish leaves and\r\nminute white flowers. With the naked eye we can usually see many drops\r\nof clear liquid on the leaves, a number of substantial-looking hairs\r\nand a few insects adhering thereto. If we examine one of these hairs\r\nunder the microscope, we shall see that it is club-shaped; it is, in\r\nfact, a hair which gives off a sticky liquid with the power of holding\r\nany luckless insect that settles thereon and absorbing its softer\r\nparts for the nourishment of the Sundew. An examination of a complete\r\nleaf with our pocket lens will show that where an insect has settled,\r\nseveral of these hairs have curled over so that they touch their\r\nvictim. Because the hairs possess this power of movement they are often\r\nwrongly called tentacles.\r\n\r\nButterwort, like Sundew has a rosette of leaves but they are greasy\r\nlooking and pale green. Their flowers are a pretty blue. Most probably\r\nwe shall notice that the edges of the leaves are curled inwards,\r\nand if we look below the curled portion we shall surely find some\r\ncaptured insects undergoing digestion. The leaf of this plant makes an\r\ninteresting object for the microscope. There are two kinds of hairs\r\non its surface, short stout ones and longer knobbed ones; the former\r\ngive off a sticky liquid which holds any small insects that touch it,\r\nthe latter give off digestive juices. While the hairs are used in\r\ndigestion, after the manner of those of Sundew, the leaf itself curls\r\nso that more of the hairs are brought into contact with the victim and\r\nthereby its digestion is hastened.\r\n\r\nMany small flowers may be examined with low magnifications. When we\r\nexamine them thus, we shall probably realise for the first time how\r\nbeautiful are many of these seemingly inconspicuous blossoms. Grass\r\nflowers are always interesting; they are not ornamental it is true, but\r\nthat does not detract from their interest. There is one part of each\r\nflower known as the stigma; it is the part on which the pollen grain\r\nmust be placed in order that seeds may be formed. The pollen grains\r\nare taken to the stigmas in many ways, but the most usual agencies\r\nare insects and wind. In the case of grasses, wind is the agency and\r\nfor that reason the stigmas of grass flowers are feathery, so that\r\nthey can easily hold the pollen grains carried to them by the lightest\r\nbreeze. We shall probably see many pollen grains entangled in the\r\nfeathery stigma of the flower we are examining. In the flowers of other\r\nplants we shall find, when we magnify them, that there are all manner\r\nof contrivances on the stigmas, all designed for holding the pollen\r\ngrains; hairs, knobs, hooks and the like.\r\n\r\nAn interesting collection could be made of various pollen grains,\r\nwhich are easily obtained by merely dusting the anthers of flowers\r\non to a clean, dry slide. They are varied in shape, colour and size;\r\nsome are smooth, some studded with spines, others again, those of the\r\n_Mallow_ for example, have little lids which open when the pollen grain\r\ngerminates. The germination of pollen grains is easily observed under\r\nthe microscope, by putting a few of the grains in an exceedingly weak\r\nsolution of sugar and water. The vigil may be a long one, but if the\r\npollen grains are ripe and fresh, and the sugary solution sufficiently\r\nweak, the patience of the microscopist will be rewarded by the\r\nobservance of the bursting of the pollen grain’s coat and the outgrowth\r\nof the pollen tube.\r\n\r\nOther pollen grains worthy of examination, are those of various lilies,\r\nof _Eschscholtzia_ and of _Scotch Fir_; the last named have curious\r\nlittle air-bladders, for the purpose of rendering them more buoyant.\r\n\r\nMany lowly plants thrive in weak sugar solutions, after the manner of\r\npollen grains. The yeast plant is one of them. A very small portion of\r\nyeast, in a drop of sugar solution, will show us one of the simplest\r\nmethods of vegetable reproduction. Yeast is a fungus and it is also a\r\nplant composed of only one cell. Under the microscope, it appears as\r\na colourless oval body. The sugar solution causes it to multiply and,\r\nafter the lapse of a little time, most of the yeast plants will be seen\r\nto bear outgrowths, called buds, which grow larger and larger till, at\r\nlength, they break away from the parent plants and start a separate\r\nexistence. Sometimes, when these plants are increasing very rapidly,\r\nthe buds will bear smaller buds and these again still smaller ones till\r\na fairly long chain of yeast plants is formed.\r\n\r\nIt is always interesting and also instructive to make comparisons as\r\nwe progress with our work. To illustrate our meaning let us compare\r\nthe budding of the yeast plant with the budding of the hydra, which is\r\ndescribed in our chapter on pond life. In the same chapter we described\r\nthe division of a proteus animalcule into two separate organisms, a\r\nprocess which is also undergone by bacteria when circumstances are\r\nfavourable to their increase. We shall find many points of similarity\r\nif we make careful comparisons, and several important differences.\r\n\r\nObjects for the microscope we can find in plenty, without going far\r\nafield. The white mould which we can probably find in the larder, on a\r\npot of jam or other food that has been allowed to stand for some time,\r\nwill provide a good subject to start upon. A little of this plant, for\r\nsuch it is, carefully lifted on to a dry slide will show the threads of\r\nthe mould, terminated by round black knobs. Breathe on the specimen and\r\nthe moisture of your breath will cause these little balls to break and\r\nset free a quantity of fine dust-like bodies called spores. The spores\r\nwill be carried about in the air, they are so light, and if they settle\r\non a suitable medium they will germinate and start another growth of\r\nmould. The blue-green mould of cheese is constructed quite differently;\r\nits spores are not contained in any hollow structures like those of our\r\nfirst object, but grow in chains radiating from a central point, like\r\nthe outstretched fingers of the hand. It is this fungus, by the way,\r\nwhich imparts the colour and flavour to gorgonzola cheese.\r\n\r\nFor some reason living organisms, possessing the power of movement,\r\nbe it ever so slight, are always more attractive than those which are\r\napparently motionless. Let us study two common objects from the plant\r\nworld which may easily be obtained by any nature student, objects\r\nwhich owe their power of movement--not to be confused with locomotion,\r\nby the way--to the presence or absence of moisture in the air. On\r\nthe under side of the fronds of many ferns there will be found more\r\nor less rounded reddish-brown spots. These outgrowths, for such they\r\nare, vary in position and shape according to the species of fern. An\r\nexamination, with a pocket lens, will show that these brownish spots\r\nconsist of minute tufts of knobbed structures, growing from the tissues\r\nof the frond. Sometimes the structures are naked, sometimes covered\r\nwith a membrane. In either case, one or more of the knobbed structures\r\nis worth examining under the microscope; we shall then see that it\r\nconsists of a stalk terminated by a thin walled portion, shaped like a\r\nbi-convex lens. Round the edge of the greater part of this lens-shaped\r\nportion there is a much more substantial-looking rim. Within the\r\nlens-shaped part we can easily see brown spores. If we have chosen our\r\nobject at an opportune moment, any excessive moisture in the air will\r\ncause the thick-walled rim to straighten itself out, tearing away the\r\nthin-walled, lens-shaped part in so doing and setting free the spores.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the ferns, the horsetails provide another\r\ninteresting object for the microscope. The fertile shoots of these\r\nplants, somewhat resembling asparagus, though in reality belonging\r\nto an entirely different family, will, when gently tapped on a clean\r\ndry microscope slide, leave behind a pale yellow powder. The powder\r\nconsists of spores, and most interesting they are. When dry, each spore\r\nwill be seen to have four somewhat thread-like outgrowths, flattened at\r\nthe end; breathe on the spores and each of the outgrowths will coil up\r\nso as to form a complete covering for the body of the spore. As drying\r\ntakes place, these outgrowths gradually uncoil again.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned spores several times in this and other chapters.\r\nStrictly speaking a spore cannot be compared with a seed, but for\r\nour purpose it is sufficient to know that spores are more or less\r\nseedlike in appearance and that they give rise to new plants when they\r\ngerminate. They are found in all ferns, on horsetails, these odd plants\r\nwith their creeping stems and rings of scale-like leaves, on club\r\nmosses, mosses proper and fungi but not on flowering plants.\r\n\r\nShould the student of plant life not yet be satiated with following the\r\nsuggestions we have made, he can turn his attention to fruits and seeds\r\nand the contrivances designed for their distribution. The fruits of\r\ngoosegrass, popularly known as cleavers, are studded with little hooks\r\nso that they may adhere to any passing animal. The fruits of Burdock\r\nare similarly armed and if we make a study of fruits and seeds we\r\nshall find that this is a very common method of ensuring distribution.\r\nThere are also a number of seeds covered with hairs which render them\r\nbuoyant; those of the willow herb are easily found, so too are the\r\nfruits of dandelion, thistle and groundsel. These and many more will\r\ngive us many an interesting hour, towards autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE AND THE MICROSCOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few more interesting animals than spiders and we may spend\r\nmany an hour learning details of their structure, which only the\r\nmicroscope can show, and studying their habits, for only by doing so is\r\nit brought home to us how astonishingly clever they are. The spider,\r\nof course, is not an insect; it has eight legs, whereas the insect has\r\nonly six, its head and thorax are fused, but in the case of insects\r\nhead and thorax are separate. There are many other, less evident,\r\npoints of difference as we shall see.\r\n\r\nFor the microscope, there are few better objects in animal land than\r\nthe feet of spiders. Their study will give us plenty of occupation for\r\nthey are modelled on various plans, according to the different kinds of\r\nspider. Taking the common garden spider as our first example we shall\r\nfind that its foot is a most ingenious contrivance. Our microscope will\r\nshow us that the foot is armed with a pair of comb-like claws. A little\r\nstudy of the habits of the spider will enlighten us concerning the\r\nuses of these combs. At this point we may remark that the examination\r\nof living creatures beneath the microscope should, whenever possible,\r\ngo hand in hand with a study of habits. Over and over again in our\r\nmicroscopical investigations we shall come across structures which\r\nappear to be useless as far as we can surmise. A careful observation\r\nof the living owners of these puzzling structures will probably clear\r\nup the whole matter. Well, let us watch a garden spider; if we do so\r\nintelligently we shall see two uses of these combs and may guess the\r\nthird. The spider uses its combs as we do, to straighten its hair;\r\nthey also clean its body. It uses them to obtain a firm grasp of the\r\nthreads of which its web is composed and, though we cannot see this, so\r\nquick are the movements of the creature, the combs serve a very useful\r\npurpose in holding captured prey.\r\n\r\nThe garden spider and its relatives are distinguished by the fact that,\r\nin addition to the two large comb-like claws, they possess a third\r\nsmaller claw and some toothed spines. The small claw and toothed spines\r\nare movable and, when pressed against very firm grasp. With these\r\ncleverly contrived feet she--it is always the lady spider who makes\r\nthe web and does all the work--hauls in the slack of the combs of the\r\nlarger claws afford their owner a her web and owing to their firm grasp\r\nshe can run readily over its meshes.\r\n\r\nThe house spider, which spins a web seemingly in a disordered tangle\r\nand quite unlike the beautiful web of the garden spider, has feet of\r\na different pattern. The most interesting feature about the legs of\r\nthis creature is the wonderful double comb with which it teases out the\r\nthreads of its web as they are formed. This comb takes the form of a\r\ndouble row of minute, curved spines on the last joint but one of the\r\nhind legs; it must certainly be examined under our microscope and we\r\nshould try to see the combs being used by the spider.\r\n\r\nWe must also make a point of examining the feet of a wolf spider for\r\nthey are constructed on a different plan to those of the spiders we\r\nhave mentioned. Wolf spiders are the creatures which spin no proper web\r\nbut lurk in holes in walls or in the ground and dash out from their\r\nhiding places to seize their prey. They usually line their lairs with\r\nsilk. We shall have more to say about wolf spiders in a moment.\r\n\r\nThe Zebra spider, which belongs to the family of jumping spiders, has\r\nvery curious feet, not so much on account of its claws as because of\r\nthe curious clubbed hairs which adorn them. This little spider is\r\nblack, with white stripes on body and legs; the peculiar habit, for\r\na spider, of leaping upon its remarkable hairs on its feet render it\r\nexceedingly sure-footed and it has need to be, for it exhibits prey.\r\n\r\nThere are many other spiders which we may examine with the certainty\r\nof finding some features of interest, the Drassid spiders which lurk\r\nbeneath bark and stones; the crab spiders usually brightly coloured\r\nlittle fellows with the habit of living in flowers; the little\r\nmoney-spinners and the harvest-men; these last are not true spiders but\r\nthey are none the less interesting, they are the small-bodied, very\r\nlong legged creatures which occasionally find their way into our houses.\r\n\r\nHaving taken our fill of the spiders’ feet we may well turn our\r\nattention to their heads. If we have caught a spider in the act of\r\nkilling a struggling fly, it must have struck us that one bite from\r\nthe spider is sufficient to kill its victim. Let us see if we can find\r\nthe jaws which so quickly bring death even to large insects. We shall\r\nrequire a steady hand and some little skill to examine them properly\r\nbut the task is not beyond our powers. Having killed our spider we\r\nmust snip off its head, place it on a slide and examine it with a low\r\nmagnification. Looking straight at the face, we can plainly see the\r\nsharply pointed, hinged jaws; in nearly all spiders they work from side\r\nto side and they can be closed on their hinges like pocket knives. With\r\na pair of mounted needles and two steady hands, let us dissect the head\r\nof our spider, so that we obtain one of the jaws quite free from its\r\nsurroundings. At the base we shall find a little sac, the poison gland,\r\nand if we now magnify the jaw much more highly we shall observe a tiny\r\nhole very near the tip. When the spider has grasped her prey in her\r\njaws she causes the poison from the poison glands to pass into the body\r\nof her victim, by way of the little hole in her jaw; the poison causes\r\nparalysis and the victim struggles no more.\r\n\r\nThe only excuse we can make for spending so much time with the spiders\r\nis that they are of the greatest interest to the microscopist.\r\nReturning to our friend the garden spider we must examine the spinning\r\norgans, known as spinnerets. These are to be found near the tip of\r\nthe abdomen on the under side. There are six pairs in all in the\r\ngarden spider but the middle pair are shorter than the others and, in\r\nconsequence, not easily seen. The tips of the fleshy little spinnerets\r\nshould be highly magnified and we shall notice that the structure of\r\nthe tips differs in each pair of spinnerets. On the foremost pair,\r\nthere is a fairly large projection and numerous small ones; on the\r\nmiddle pair three large projections and many smaller ones, whilst on\r\nthe hind pair, in addition to the small projections there are five\r\nlarge ones. The large projections are called spigots and the small ones\r\nare known as spools; from the former is derived the strong silk of the\r\nweb, from the spools the fine threads issue.\r\n\r\nOn the underside of our garden spider there is a dark patch and, just\r\nin front of this dark spot, are a pair of slits. These we must open up\r\nvery carefully, in a dead specimen of course, and within, if we have\r\nsucceeded in our dissection, we shall see from fifteen to twenty little\r\nflaps resembling the leaves of a book, in fact they are known as lung\r\nbooks and, by means of them, the spider breathes.\r\n\r\nOne more word and we must leave the spiders. The eyes must be examined\r\nin every specimen. Most spiders have eight eyes, set like little gems\r\nin the front part of the head; some have six eyes, some only two and\r\na few kinds are eyeless, but these last spend all their lives in dark\r\ncaves, so eyes would be useless to them. When we examine the eyes of\r\nwolf spiders we shall observe that they are placed on the tops of\r\nlittle projections so that their owners may better be enabled to see\r\nall around them.\r\n\r\nThe hairs and scales of many spiders make beautiful objects for the\r\nmicroscope. We must make a point of examining the hairs of the water\r\nspider also the scales from the Zebra spider. The latter with their\r\nfeathery form and iridescent colouring, are particularly beautiful.\r\nWe may advantageously spend a moment or two in the examination of the\r\nspider’s web and the threads of which it is made. The strands radiating\r\nfrom the centre of the web differ from those which are arranged\r\nspirally. The latter are covered with a sticky substance as may be seen\r\nunder the microscope. When these spiral threads are laid down by the\r\nspider, the sticky substance covers their whole length in a thin film,\r\nbut the little architect adds a finishing touch, by pulling the thread\r\nas a bowman pulls his bow and then releasing it suddenly. The result of\r\nthis performance is that the sticky substance forms a series of minute\r\nglobules over the whole length of the thread.\r\n\r\nIn order to be in a position thoroughly to master the details of\r\nanimal structure it is necessary to have acquired sufficient skill to\r\ncut sections. They cannot, however, be cut so easily as is the case\r\nwith plant sections. The various parts of animals are either so hard,\r\n_e.g._, bones and teeth, that they must be treated almost as pieces of\r\nrock and rubbed down till they are transparent, or they are so soft\r\nthat they require soaking in various chemicals to make them harder and\r\neven then it is usually necessary to imbed them, _i.e._, surround them\r\nwith some easily melted substance which sets moderately hard, such as\r\nparaffin wax. Cutting sections of animal parts is beyond the average\r\namateur.\r\n\r\nThe feathers of birds make beautiful objects for the microscope. For\r\nthose microscopists who desire beauty of colour rather than details of\r\nstructure it is hard to beat the glorious shades of certain feathers\r\nbeneath the microscope. To obtain the best effect a fairly low\r\nmagnification should be used and all manner of lighting thrown upon\r\nthe object, for we have all seen the feather which appears drab at\r\none angle is of the greatest brilliance at another. Various feathers\r\nand from various parts of birds should be examined, if we desire to\r\nunderstand their structure. Each feather consists of a vast number\r\nof cells but it is improbable that we shall be able to prove this\r\nstatement by the examination of any large feather. We must take a\r\ndown feather, notice carefully the arrangement of its various parts,\r\nfor it will be interesting to compare this soft, weak feather with a\r\ncomparatively strong flight feather from a wing. Now, under a higher\r\nmagnification, we can plainly see the little cells of which the down\r\nfeather is built up.\r\n\r\nOne of the strong wing feathers of such a bird as a pigeon is of the\r\ngreatest interest as a microscopic object. We must take a few of the\r\nbarbules, the slender, flattened portions of the feather which fringe\r\neither side of the barb. A moderately high magnification will show how\r\ningeniously they are contrived. The hinder side of each barbule is a\r\nmoderately thick upwardly curved edge whilst, on the forward side,\r\nthere is a row of curved hooks. When the feather is neat and tidy, and\r\nits owner when in good health usually sees to it that its feathers\r\nare well kept, the hooks of one barbule engage with the curved edge\r\nof the next barbule. The feather, by means of this ingenious locking\r\ndevice, becomes much more nearly a solid structure than would be the\r\ncase if the barbules did not hook on to one another. The arrangement\r\nfor hooking together the fore and hind wings of bees and wasps is very\r\nsimilar. We may examine a number of flight feathers but we shall not\r\nfind any very striking differences between those of various birds. All,\r\napparently, follow a common design.\r\n\r\nFrom feathers to hair and from hair to horns and some scales is not a\r\nvery far cry. We have talked about the examination of hair in another\r\nchapter, so we will not repeat ourselves here. Scales we shall most of\r\nus have opportunities of examining in plenty. We have just mentioned\r\nthat some scales are comparable to hairs and feathers. Such scales\r\nare to be found in snakes and lizards. The scales of fish are of a\r\ndifferent order but they are equally or even more interesting when\r\nexamined under the microscope.\r\n\r\nIf we live in a district where many and various fish are caught we\r\nshall soon discover that their scales differ in a remarkable degree.\r\nSome are of the texture of horn, some are gristly, some bony and some\r\ncovered with enamel, after the manner of teeth. Not only do they differ\r\nin texture but in design as we shall see in a moment.\r\n\r\nCertain fishes, the eel is one, the mackerel another, are said to be\r\nscaleless. As a fact their scales are very thin and transparent and so\r\narranged that they are less evident than those of other fish. By taking\r\na little of the skin of one of these fish we can easily detach a few\r\nscales for examination. Those of the eel we shall find are very thin\r\nand delicate and quite transparent. These and all other fish-scales\r\nmay be made into permanent slides by mounting in Canada Balsam, as\r\ndescribed in our last chapter.\r\n\r\nThe carp, whiting, salmon, sprat, herring and many other fish have\r\nscales called cycloid or circular; the term is rather a misnomer\r\nbecause they are not truly circular, but the name is used to\r\ndistinguish them from other scales. The structure is easily made\r\nout with a moderate magnification. Many of these scales, however,\r\nexhibit portions more dense than the rest; these dense spots are\r\ncaused by little particles of lime which may be seen under a higher\r\nmagnification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1. A THORN INSECT.--A striking example of protective resemblance.\r\n  When resting on a thorny twig this little insect is safe from all its\r\n  enemies. 2. THE HEAD OF PALM WEEVIL.--The long snout distinguishes\r\n  the weavils from all other beetles. Its very long front legs are also\r\n  worthy of notice. 3. A LEAF INSECT.--Green in colour, this insect\r\n  bears a remarkable similarity to a leaf. Its sluggish habits heighten\r\n  the illusion. 4. THE HEAD OF STICK INSECT.--There are few more\r\n  curious insects than the stick insects. The specimen illustrated has\r\n  a very bird-like head.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nPerch, pike, sole and some other fish have much more peculiar scales,\r\nknown as ctenoid or combed for the reason that their unattached, that\r\nis to say their hinder margins, are toothed like a comb.\r\n\r\nThe scales of sharks, dog-fish and rays are called placoid for they\r\nare toothed; not only so but their arrangement is frequently quite\r\ndissimilar to the scales of ordinary fish. Taking the herring as our\r\nexample, but a salmon or any other fish would serve equally well, and\r\nexamining the arrangement of its scales with the help of our pocket\r\nlens, we shall find that the scales are fixed to the fish by their\r\nforward edges and that each scale partly overlaps its neighbour, as do\r\ntiles on a roof. In the shark family, however, the scales are often\r\nrelatively wide apart, they do not overlap but are imbedded separately\r\nin the skin. The scales of rays have each a hard spine projecting from\r\nthe centre, those of sharks and dog-fish have teeth, and they are teeth\r\nnot only in appearance but also in structure.\r\n\r\nThe ganoid scales of sturgeon we are hardly likely to meet with.\r\nSometimes these fish are on sale in London and other large towns and a\r\nspecimen of their scales may be procured. They are bony in structure\r\nand, though interesting, require a considerable amount of preparation\r\nto render them sufficiently transparent to be examined under the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that all the fossil fish which are\r\ndiscovered from time to time have either ganoid or placoid scales,\r\na fact which shows that the sharks, rays and sturgeon are directly\r\ndescended from creatures which swam the seas thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\nThe shells of shell-fish are not easy to examine microscopically,\r\nbut frequently their plates may be detached from the edges of such\r\nshells as oysters and mussels and these should be examined. If the\r\nouter part of the shell be taken we can easily see its honeycomb\r\nstructure and, by adding a little acid and waiting till all action\r\nhas ceased, we shall have a structure remaining which is remarkably\r\nlike a number of plant cells. The inner layer of many of these shells\r\nis composed of beautifully iridescent mother-of-pearl. Now such\r\niridescence is usually caused by surfaces furrowed with many very fine\r\nlines and mother-of-pearl is no exception. Under the microscope, with\r\na moderately high magnification, we can see minute striations all\r\npractically parallel to one another.\r\n\r\nThe cuttlefish is peculiar in having a skeleton which is a moderately\r\nsoft plate. These plates can often be found washed up by the tide,\r\nmay be cut out from a dead cuttlefish or bought from a chemist’s as\r\ncuttlefish bone. However we secure the material we shall find that one\r\nside of the “bone” is hollow and that across this hollow, delicate\r\nplates run parallel to one another at intervals. Between these parallel\r\nplates there appear to be a number of fibres but, if we cut a thin\r\nslice of the structure and examine it under the microscope, we shall\r\nsee that the apparent fibres are really very thin plates of bone which\r\nwind and double upon themselves in a beautiful manner. The structure of\r\nthese plates gives strength to the bone without adding to its weight.\r\n\r\nSnails are sure to attract the microscopist sooner or later, so too are\r\nslugs. Many of the latter have shells, small flat or ear-shaped shells,\r\nquite different to the portable homes of snails. In many young snails,\r\nwhich may be killed by dropping into boiling water, we can find the\r\nshells so transparent that they form good objects for our microscope.\r\nSometimes they are composed of six-sided cells, sometimes of beautiful\r\nstar-shaped cells.\r\n\r\nFrom the microscopist’s point of view the most interesting feature of\r\nthe snail is its rasping organ, often wrongly termed the tongue. To\r\nfind this organ it is necessary to open up the mouth of a dead snail,\r\nand if we seek the assistance of our lens while doing so, we shall\r\nhave no difficulty in finding the rasp--it may be recognised by the\r\nminute teeth with which it is furnished. The whole structure should be\r\ncarefully removed and mounted upon a slide. In some kinds of snails\r\nthere are but a hundred teeth, other kinds, however, possess as many\r\nas twenty-six thousand eight hundred. The snail makes use of this\r\nremarkable organ to procure its food. Vegetation is pressed against a\r\nplate at the top of the creature’s mouth and literally filed into small\r\npieces by the rasping organ. Captive water snails may be watched while\r\nusing their rasp upon the water plants or upon the green slime which\r\nsoon accumulates in aquaria. The eggs of snails are easily found and\r\nshould be examined, the queer little inmates may be studied through the\r\ntransparent shells, in all stages of development.\r\n\r\nThe naturalist whose inclinations lead him towards the study of animal\r\nlife will find plenty to occupy his time and his microscope. All kinds\r\nof eggs of small creatures may be watched as they develop. Frogs’\r\neggs are of interest in this respect, so too are tadpoles which hatch\r\nfrom them. The whole blood circulation in a young tadpole may easily\r\nbe studied under the microscope, the structure of the external gills,\r\nthe gradual change to internal gills, the development of legs, the\r\nabsorption of the tail. The tadpole and its marvellous changes will\r\nafford sufficient microscopic material to last for many weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE STUDY OF THE ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of rocks and minerals by means of the microscope is apt\r\nto be disappointing. In the first place, to study them seriously we\r\nrequire a special microscope, the ordinary instrument, with which we\r\nmay poke into the deepest secrets of the animal and plant world cannot\r\ntranslate for us half the story of the rocks. Again, to understand\r\nrocks and minerals we must study them somewhat deeply. Geology, as\r\nthe science of rocks is called, is no more difficult than botany or\r\nzoology, the sciences of plants and animals respectively. Botany and\r\nzoology, however, appeal in some degree to nearly all of us; we may\r\nlearn a good deal concerning the structure of the cockroach with the\r\nhelp of our microscope and be interested in the revelations of our\r\ninstrument, but to embark on a detailed course of the minute internal\r\nanatomy of insects would appeal to few of us. Animal or plant life may\r\nbe studied piecemeal and enjoyed on account of its absorbing interest.\r\nGeology must be studied from its very beginnings if we are really to\r\nunderstand what we see beneath the microscope.\r\n\r\nIn the hand, a lump of rock, say of granite, may be of exceeding\r\nbeauty. The body of the rock is, perhaps, a delicate pink, scattered\r\nhere and there are the flat glittering plates of mica and brilliant\r\ncrystals of quartz. Other rocks, less common, vie with the rare gems\r\nfor beauty of colouring and lustre. As thin microscope sections these\r\nonce gorgeous specimens are colourless, dull and, unless we understand\r\nthem, uninteresting.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many mineral substances which we may study with\r\nadvantage for, if our investigations do not take us very far towards\r\nelucidating the story of the rocks, we shall at any rate discover\r\nsomething that is new to us. We may well commence our studies with the\r\nexamination of ordinary sand. This is not a rock, you will probably\r\nexclaim. You are right but one day it may be a rock, it all depends\r\nupon circumstances.\r\n\r\nBefore we take out our microscope let us have a short talk about rocks\r\nin general, then we may understand better where we are. Rocks of one\r\nkind and another make up the crust of the earth, that is pretty obvious\r\nanyway. Thousands and thousands of years ago, how many we are not\r\nprepared to guess, this old earth of ours was a sphere of molten rock.\r\nNeedless to say it was far too hot for any plants or animals to dwell\r\nupon it. Very, very gradually the outer crust cooled down and in time\r\nit became sufficiently cool to support animal and vegetable life. Then\r\nthere were rivers and seas and then came, from time to time, rain and\r\nwind and frost and even earthquakes. The earthquakes cracked the crust\r\nof the earth, moisture entered the cracks and, when the frosts came,\r\npieces of rock were broken away, owing to the expansion of the moisture\r\nin the cracks as it became converted into ice. The rain and wind helped\r\nto carry the broken pieces of rock, ever downwards towards the sea,\r\nbut before the sea was reached the big boulders became broken up, by\r\ntheir buffeting, into shingle and sand and mud. In the course of long\r\nages, longer than it is easy to imagine, these broken pieces of rock,\r\ngathered together as we have seen from various districts, may have been\r\nleft high and dry, for the face of the earth has not always been as we\r\nknow it now.\r\n\r\nIn time all the little particles became welded together to form a new\r\nkind of rock. Sometimes animals and plants were buried in the mud\r\ndestined to become a rock and their parts were so well preserved that\r\nthey may not only be recognised by present-day scientists, but in\r\nmany cases their structure may be made out so well with the aid of a\r\nmicroscope that no one would guess they had been buried thousands of\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nNew rocks have been formed not only by the breaking up and welding\r\ntogether of the original earth’s crust, but by animal and plant\r\nremains. In some places, in past ages, billions and billions of little\r\nshell-fish have lived in the waters, died there and their shells\r\nhave fallen to the bottom of their watery home. Now we know their\r\nshell remains as chalk or if it has undergone great pressure, owing to\r\nchanges in the earth’s surface, as limestone. There are rock masses\r\nalso formed of the remains of countless Diatoms; sponge spicules, too,\r\nhave played their part in rock formation.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from what we have written that, in the first place, the\r\nrocks of the earth form two great divisions, the rocks which formed\r\nthe original crust of the earth, Primary rocks they are called, and\r\nthe later-formed Secondary rocks. The Primary rocks are often glassy\r\nin appearance, they show unmistakable signs of having once been molten\r\nand they never contain animal or plant remains, fossils as they are\r\ncalled, for the reason we have already explained. The secondary rocks\r\noften betray their origin by occurring in layers, or strata to speak\r\nmore scientifically. Always when we think of the rocks we must think in\r\nthousands of years, then it will be easier to understand the formation\r\nof these strata, each one of which may represent the work of hundreds\r\nand hundreds of years.\r\n\r\nNow to return to our sand; we have explained briefly that sand is\r\nreally the remains of broken up rocks. First we have the solid rock,\r\nboulders are broken from it as the boulders are acted upon by rain,\r\nfrost and wind: they become more and more broken up and at the same\r\ntime they are carried towards the sea where they take the form of\r\nshingle. The shingle, in the course of time, becomes broken up into\r\nsand, and the sand again becomes so finely divided that it forms mud.\r\nFrom this it is clear that the composition of the sand depends largely\r\non the nature of the rocks in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _By the courtesy of Messrs. F. Davidson & Co._\r\n\r\n  1. FORAMINIFERA\r\n\r\n    Small sea shells. The inmates die and the shells, falling to the\r\n    bottom of the sea, are gradually converted into chalk.\r\n\r\n  2. DIATOMS\r\n\r\n    Small water plants which make beautiful objects for the microscope\r\n    by reason of their remarkable shapes and sculpturing.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we must place a little of our sand upon a piece of black\r\npaper and examine by reflected light. We shall soon notice that sand\r\nis anything but the simple gritty looking substance it appears on the\r\nsea shore. At least four different substances are certain to be seen;\r\nif the sand be clean, we shall see bright glassy crystals of quartz;\r\nangular, sharp-edged pieces of flint; minute, flat, glistening plates\r\nof mica and the broken remains of shells. Should our sand be taken from\r\na spot in the vicinity of volcanic rocks, it will probably contain\r\nopaque pieces of magnetite; we may not recognise these when we see\r\nthem, but they may be separated from the rest of the sand by means of\r\na magnet, to which they will adhere. Probably our sample of sand will\r\nbe dirty or stained with iron, in this event we may wash it with weak\r\nacid, then after drying, we may examine by transmitted light and the\r\nvarious crystals will show up well.\r\n\r\nLet us take some clay as our next example. Clay is the substance from\r\nwhich the rocks known as shale and slate have been formed. We cannot\r\nsee much of the structure of clay with our microscope so let us wash\r\nit and, by so doing separate it into its components. We must put a\r\nlittle clay into a tumbler of water and stir it vigorously for some\r\nlittle time, then still stirring, if we pour off the muddy liquid into\r\nanother tumbler, we shall find that our old friend sand has settled to\r\nthe bottom. Clay then is merely mud and sand, but we must not throw\r\nthis sand away without examining it for, very frequently, beautiful\r\nminute fossils are to be found amongst it. Little creatures dwelling in\r\nthe mud, become buried in it and, as more and more mud is formed above\r\nthem, and it becomes partly solidified in the form of clay, they become\r\nfossilized.\r\n\r\nIf now we examine a piece of sandstone with our pocket lens we shall\r\nfind that it very closely resembles the sand we have already studied.\r\nIt may be so soft that we can break it up in our fingers, then if we\r\nexamine the powdered sandstone beneath the microscope we shall need\r\nto be experts to tell whether we are examining sand or sandstone.\r\nShould our rock be too hard to break up in our fingers the addition\r\nof a little weak acid will reduce it to sand. We see now that a\r\nlarge proportion of sand and a small proportion of mud result in the\r\nformation of sandstone, whereas if the proportions are reversed and we\r\nhave more mud than sand the resulting rock is known as shale or slate.\r\nIn shale we very frequently find fossils, in sandstone rarely, for the\r\nreason that structures buried in the mud, destined to become shale,\r\nare protected from the atmosphere and the action of water; sandstone,\r\non the other hand, is porous, moisture trickles through it and any\r\ndelicate structures which may have been buried in it are more likely\r\nto decompose than to become fossilized.\r\n\r\nLimestone is easy to obtain and may occupy us for a few moments. We do\r\nnot wish to go into technical details, but we may say that the word\r\nlimestone includes a number of rocks which differ largely in appearance\r\nand to a considerable extent in composition. It would, perhaps, be\r\nmore correct to say that there are several kinds of limestone. Some\r\nkinds are made up almost entirely of shells and very interesting they\r\nare as microscopic objects. One may wonder how a geologist can state\r\nwith certainty that some spot, may be many miles from the sea, was\r\nonce covered by salt water. One of these shell-formed limestones may\r\ngive him the information; he knows that certain shells comprising the\r\nrock must have belonged to marine animals, he knows too that whole\r\nmountains, which these rocks sometimes form, are not carried bodily on\r\nto dry land, so the obvious inference is that the rock was formed below\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThe softer limestones may easily be crumbled and powdered for\r\nexamination under the microscope; the harder kinds should be treated\r\nwith acid. When acid is added to limestone a considerable effervescence\r\ntakes place, for the acid decomposes a substance known as calcium\r\ncarbonate, which the limestone contains, and bubbles of gas are given\r\noff. When the limestone has ceased to effervesce the portions of the\r\nrock which remain, may be carefully washed in water, dried and examined\r\nunder the microscope. We shall find that the substance we examine\r\nconsists of sand containing a goodly number of plates of mica and there\r\nmay also be a number of sponge spicules. We must bear in mind when we\r\nare examining the remnants of limestone after treatment with acid, that\r\nshells are largely composed of calcium carbonate, so it is useless to\r\nlook for any shell remains, for the acid will have dissolved them.\r\n\r\nCalcium carbonate, in a nearly pure state, will and does form rock-like\r\nstructures; we are most of us familiar with stalactites which are\r\nformed on the roofs of caves. These structures are usually composed of\r\ncalcium carbonate though sometimes, notably in some of the Derbyshire\r\ncaves, Barium takes the place of Calcium. Should we have the chance\r\nof examining a section of a stalactite we should certainly do so. We\r\ncan see the rings which are formed, as layer after layer of calcium\r\ncarbonate is deposited, in fact the section of a stalactite bears a\r\nstriking resemblance to a stem of a tree and has, before now, been\r\nmistaken for a fossil stem.\r\n\r\nIf the study of rocks appeals to us we should make a point of examining\r\nall the specimens we can lay hands upon. Many quite common specimens\r\nmay easily be obtained; rock-salt, for example, though in itself not of\r\ngreat interest as an object for the microscope, will readily dissolve\r\nin water, leaving behind an insoluble residue of iron which is well\r\nworth examination. The majority of rocks, however, are not affected by\r\nwater and but little by acids. With such specimens the only course\r\nopen to the microscopist is to prepare sections.\r\n\r\nThe making of rock sections is certainly different to the cutting of\r\nplant or animal sections. It is a laborious business as the enthusiast\r\nwill find to his cost. The professional makers of rock sections have\r\nspecial grindstones or lathes for the purpose and, even so, the process\r\nis not rapid. The amateur must needs do all his preparation by hand.\r\nThe requirements, in addition to the piece of rock of which we require\r\na section, are a small square of plate glass, some Canada Balsam,\r\nemery powder of various grades and an unlimited stock of patience. If\r\npossible we choose a piece of rock with one side as nearly as possible\r\nflat; this is merely to save labour; the piece of rock should be\r\nroughly about half-an-inch square. As a start we rub the flattest side\r\nin a mixture, practically a paste, of coarse emery powder and water.\r\nAs a matter of fact, we may keep the piece of rock in our pocket and\r\ngrind it when occasion offers on a flat stone wall or on any surface\r\nthat will assist in producing a flat surface. When we have ground our\r\nsurface flat and smooth, we finish it off with fine emery powder and\r\nmay then polish it with jeweller’s rouge. So much for the first side\r\nand, if we do not cry enough at this period, we may proceed to the\r\ngrinding of the other side. Taking our slab of plate glass, we fasten\r\nthe polished side of our piece of rock to it by means of Canada Balsam,\r\nthen we may rest for a few days while the Balsam sets. As soon as the\r\nrock is firmly fixed to the glass we proceed as before, but in this\r\ncase the final grinding and polishing must be very carefully carried\r\nout. Towards the end of the operation our original lump of rock will be\r\nreduced to the thinness of a cover slip and to its fragility. Having\r\ngiven the finishing touches with jeweller’s rouge, we put the glass,\r\nwith its attached rock section into a bottle of xylol (to be obtained\r\nfrom any chemist). The xylol dissolves the Canada Balsam and the rock\r\nsection falls from its support. A further washing in clean xylol should\r\nbe given and then the section is ready for mounting, which is best done\r\nin Canada Balsam. The section may be carefully fixed to the slide with\r\na drop of Balsam or it may be covered with a cover slip, in the usual\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIn our concluding chapter we give hints on slide making and addresses\r\nof firms who supply slides. Our advice in that chapter is to prepare\r\none’s own slides where possible; in the case of rock sections, however,\r\nwe must change our advice, only the microscopist of unlimited leisure\r\ncan find time to make his own slides.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting branches of rock study deals with the\r\nfossil remains of plants and animals. Fossils are interesting in\r\nthemselves: they are doubly interesting because they tell us more than\r\nwe could ever have discovered without them, concerning the living forms\r\nwhich inhabited the earth at different periods. Geologists know the\r\norder in which the various secondary rocks were formed and by studying\r\nthe fossils of these various rock formations, from the earliest to the\r\nlatest, can tell which animals and plants have been longest upon the\r\nearth. Some of the living forms of to-day have existed from very early\r\ntimes; we know, for example, that cockroaches were upon the earth long\r\nages ago, for their fossil remains are found in the very early rocks.\r\n\r\nFor the most part the fossils of animal forms do not make good objects\r\nfor the microscope. The _Foraminifera_, minute creatures dwelling in\r\nshells, are the most suitable for microscopic examination and very\r\nbeautiful some of them are. They are best examined by reflected light,\r\nfor then their little shells show their delicate pearly sheen.\r\n\r\nSponge spicules, as may be guessed from their hardness, are common in\r\nthe fossil state; there are also fossils of sea-anemone ancestors and\r\nfossils also of _Hydra_ colonies. The last named, known as graptolites,\r\nlook not unlike lead-pencil marks on the rock. They exist in many\r\nforms; _Diplograptus_ has a stem with two rows of cups in which the\r\nlittle creatures lived long ages ago; _Monograptus_ has but one row\r\nof cups upon its stem, whilst _Didymograptus_ is a branched form.\r\nThese fossils are by no means rare and are worth studying under the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nThere are curious fossils knows as _Trilobites_, not unlike the\r\npresent-day wood lice; they too may be studied, for some of them show\r\nall their characteristic markings as plainly as they must have appeared\r\non the living animals.\r\n\r\nIn the plant world, many fossils in amazingly, good states of\r\npreservation have been found. Some of the giant Club Mosses from the\r\ncoal measures, exhibit all the characteristic stem markings, leaf\r\nscars and the like, so clearly that one might imagine one examined a\r\nliving specimen. Most of the plant remains are beyond the reach of\r\nthe amateur, but many of them may be viewed in museums, in different\r\nparts of the country and the microscopist, whether he be a student of\r\nrocks or a lover of plants, should make a point of examining them. From\r\nquite fragmentary remains, scientists have been able to conjecture what\r\nvegetation covered the earth at various ages. The present is the age\r\nof flowering plants, but long ago the world was green with giant Club\r\nMosses and Horsetails, very humble plants at the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE MICROSCOPE AS DETECTIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an unfortunate fact that our food is not always absolutely pure.\r\nIt may be contaminated with foreign matter either by accident or by\r\ndesign. However careful the manufacturer may be in, say the preparation\r\nof cocoa, some dust, some waste vegetable matter, perhaps even a few\r\nstray dried insects may occur as impurities. They are out of place\r\ncertainly but, at the worst, they are a sign of lack of care on the\r\npart of the manufacturer. There is another, more serious side to the\r\nquestion of food adulteration, where the foreign matter is added\r\npurposely, either because it is cheap, because it weighs heavily,\r\nimparts a pleasing colour or an agreeable aroma. Such adulteration is a\r\nform of fraud and the microscope is an invaluable aid in its detection.\r\n\r\nIn many respects the microscope is a better informant than the tests\r\nof the chemists; in some cases, however, it merely supplements and\r\nconfirms the chemical results. Let us consider, for a moment, the\r\nadvantages possessed by the microscope and also where chemistry scores.\r\n\r\nVery frequently the results of costly law cases hang on the reports of\r\nexpert food examiners; every care, therefore, must be taken to avoid\r\nerror. This being the case, whenever possible, chemical tests should\r\nbe carried out to confirm the results of microscopic examination. When\r\nboth microscopist and chemist come to the same conclusion, there is\r\nnot likely to be any mistake. There are tests which the microscope\r\ncannot perform, there are some, also, which are beyond the powers\r\nof the chemist and many which are very difficult for him. A drop of\r\nmilk, for example, examined under the microscope shows a number of fat\r\nglobules floating in a watery liquid. However clever the microscopist\r\nand however accurate his instrument, he cannot tell if there is an\r\nexcessive quantity of water, yet a simple chemical test will answer\r\nthe question. This is a case in which the microscope is of little use,\r\nalthough it is only fair to add that microscopic examination would\r\nreveal the presence of blood, hair and dirt, to mention three common\r\nimpurities, which the chemist in his test for watered milk would\r\nquite overlook. With a little care and the use of suitable stains,\r\nany bacteria which might be present would also show plainly under a\r\npowerful microscope.\r\n\r\nNow for an example or two where the microscopist has the advantage\r\nof the chemist. Some jam makers have been known to be sufficiently\r\nunscrupulous to sell “raspberry” jam contaminated with a large\r\npercentage of some cheaper fruit, such as gooseberry. The seeds of the\r\ntwo fruits differ so markedly that it is really not necessary to employ\r\na microscope to discover the fraud, but a case is on record where\r\nwooden seeds were used, so like the true seeds of the raspberry, that\r\na very careful examination was necessary to show what had happened.\r\nIn our chapter on the Microscope in Agriculture we have referred to\r\nthis point in greater detail. Starch of various kinds is a very common\r\nfood adulterant and the experienced microscopist can estimate almost\r\nprecisely, the proportions of different starches in a mixture, a\r\nfeat which would sorely puzzle the chemist. So in certain cases the\r\nmicroscope is indispensable.\r\n\r\nBriefly the microscope is a time saver; chemical tests occupy a\r\nconsiderable time; microscopic examination is quick, the experienced\r\nmicroscopist at once recognises what he observes. Very small quantities\r\ncan be examined under the microscope, relatively large quantities are\r\nrequired for chemical tests. Again, if only a small quantity of the\r\nmaterial is available for examination and it is necessary to carry out\r\nchemical tests, they can be performed under the microscope and this\r\npoint is considered in another chapter.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned that starch of various kinds is a common adulterant\r\nof many foods and the budding food analyst might do worse than learn\r\nto recognise the various starch grains under the microscope. They\r\nare easily obtained and as easily observed. Each variety of starch\r\nhas grains which are remarkably constant in their characteristics. A\r\nbeginning may profitably be made with potato starch, for its grains\r\nare large and they possess certain well-marked features, which may or\r\nmay not be present in the grains of other starches. By scraping the\r\nnewly cut surface of a potato we can obtain thousands of starch grains.\r\nThe surface of the potato must not be grated, just a gentle scraping\r\nwith a pocket knife and a mere speck of the cloudy liquid that is\r\nobtained, added to a drop of clean water on our slide, will suffice.\r\nCover the object with a cover glass and examine under a fairly high\r\nmagnification. There are countless, oval, almost transparent bodies\r\nin our field of view, they are potato starch grains. Each one, as we\r\nshall see when we make a more careful examination, is not unlike a\r\nminiature oyster-shell. In the shell, there is a point which is its\r\noldest part and the remainder has grown, layer by layer, round that\r\npoint till the shell is fully formed. Now we magnify the starch grains\r\nas highly as possible and slowly rotate the fine adjustment to and fro,\r\nfor the reason that the object is not flat and by doing so, we obtain\r\nall its parts in focus in turn. If the illumination is not too intense,\r\nwe shall notice a minute dark dot corresponding to the oldest part of\r\nthe oyster shell; it is, in fact, the oldest part of the starch grain.\r\nAround this point we can see as we focus up and down, ring after ring\r\nwhere the grain has grown larger and larger. The dark spot is called\r\nthe hilum and the rings are known as striations. In the potato starch\r\ngrain the hilum is not central and the striations are not circular.\r\nWheat has large and almost round grains without a hilum or striations,\r\nthose of Barley are very similar but smaller and not so uniformly\r\nround. Rye grains are frequently cracked and often have ragged edges.\r\n\r\nA very large number of these objects may be examined, for it is useful\r\nto know their structure if one’s object be to examine various foods;\r\nfrom the point of view of beauty, when examined with a polariscope,\r\nthey have few rivals. Maize starch, which is to be found in most houses\r\nunder the name of corn flour consists of two kinds of grain. Some\r\nare many sided and angular, all of one size and without striations,\r\nthey are also split at the centre; the other grains are rounded, of\r\nvarious sizes and are never like the angular grains grouped together.\r\nThe former come from the horny part of the maize, the latter from the\r\nfloury portion.\r\n\r\nRice starch is also many sided and angular, almost crystal like; there\r\nare, however, never any rounded forms and this serves to distinguish\r\nit from maize starch. The shape of Arrowroot starch grains varies\r\naccording to the plant from which it is derived, for this substance\r\ndoes not all come from one kind of plant but, whether the grains be\r\npear shaped, hammer shaped, triangular or dumbell shaped they all\r\nshow striations and an x-shaped split in place of a hilum. Tapioca\r\nstarch grains are usually grouped together in twos or threes; when\r\nthey rest on their flat surfaces they appear circular and each hilum\r\nis surrounded by a dark ring, when on their sides they are seen to be\r\nsugar-loaf shaped.\r\n\r\nMany more starches can be found without going far afield, Sago, Peas,\r\nBeans, Lentils and Bananas are a few common commodities containing\r\nstarch. An effort should be made to study the very curious dumbell\r\nshaped starch grains of the Spurge and its relations. All these plants\r\ncontain a white milky juice in which the starch grains float; by\r\nsqueezing a little of this milky fluid into a drop of water on a clean\r\nslide the grains can easily be observed.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes difficult to observe starch grains till a fair amount\r\nof experience has been gained in the use of the microscope. Should\r\nthis difficulty arise, it may be overcome by adding a drop of a weak\r\nsolution of iodine. This will stain the starch grains a deep blue\r\ncolour and render them very easy of observation. The iodine solution\r\nmust be weak, however, or the staining will be excessive and the\r\nobjects rendered black and non-transparent.\r\n\r\nHaving examined many or all of the specimens we have mentioned let us\r\nturn our attention to some of the common foods, and learn some of the\r\nmethods used in testing for impurities. Ordinary household bread, it\r\nis hardly necessary to state, is rich in starch and, by trying the\r\niodine test, mentioned above its presence is easily shown. With a\r\nweak solution the deeper the blue colour produced, the greater the\r\nquantity of starch. Some parts of the bread will be stained yellow,\r\nthis indicates the presence of another nourishing component of bread.\r\nCertain kinds of bread are supposed to contain no free starch, because\r\nthis substance is not beneficial to some people. Iodine again will\r\nreveal whether the bread is as it is described, for, if there be\r\nno free starch there will be no blue colouration. Brown bread will\r\nshow much more of the yellow colouration and less of the blue than\r\nwhite bread. Good, well-baked bread should keep for a considerable\r\nperiod without turning sour; we can easily see whether our sample is\r\nsatisfactory by running a drop of litmus on to it and watching the\r\neffect under the microscope; if the litmus remains unchanged in colour\r\nthe sample is not sour; if, on the other hand, the litmus turns red it\r\nshows us that acid is present and that our bread is not as it should be.\r\n\r\nTea is difficult to prepare for microscopic examination and most of\r\nthe tests call for expert knowledge, not only in the management of the\r\nmicroscope but of the plant itself. The structure of the leaves can\r\nbe made out clearly in specimens which have been soaked for a time in\r\nwater, but this is of little interest to the ordinary microscopist.\r\nOne very pretty test may, however, easily be performed. We all know\r\nthat it is not good to drink tea which has been standing for a long\r\ntime. Some tea-drinkers are so particular that they cannot bear to see\r\nthe teapot shaken before they have poured out their cup. All this\r\ntrouble arises because tea contains a poison called “theine”; it is an\r\nalkaloid, one of a large class of chemical substances which are nearly\r\nall deadly poisons--cocaine and nicotine are alkaloids. Although theine\r\nis poisonous, tea which contained none of this substance would be\r\ntasteless and the absence of this substance shows that the tea leaves\r\nhave been badly prepared. Tea after being gathered should be dried at\r\nonce, sometimes it is re-dried and this process drives off the theine.\r\nFor our test we require, in addition to our microscope, two watch\r\nglasses, a piece of copper wire gauze and a gas burner or a spirit\r\nlamp. Place a little tea in one of the watch glasses and cover with\r\nthe other watch glass; then heat gently on the wire gauze. In a few\r\nminutes drops of moisture will appear on the upper watch glass; after\r\nabout ten minutes’ heating beautiful, long, needle-shaped crystals\r\nwill begin to appear, with a little further heating we shall obtain a\r\ngood crop of lovely crystals on the upper watch glass and they make a\r\nsplendid object for examination under a low magnification. The crystals\r\nare of theine, the poisonous component of tea, and the test is used\r\nto discover whether the tea has been redried during its preparation;\r\nredried tea gives no crystals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photos by Flatters & Garnett_\r\n\r\n  THE STINGING HAIRS OF A NETTLE\r\n\r\n    These hairs are much longer than ordinary plant hairs.

Each scale is a hollow sac,\r\n    affixed by its notched end to a pit in the insect’s wing.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe examination of cocoa for impurities is a matter rather for the\r\nchemist than for the microscopist. It contains a vast number of starch\r\ngrains, not unlike those of rice, except that they are rounded. Coffee\r\noften contains a number of impurities, the chief being chicory,\r\nvarious starches, ground acorns and date stones. Chicory is really an\r\nimpurity, though it is one often asked for by coffee-drinkers. It is\r\neasy to detect the amount of chicory present in a sample of ground\r\ncoffee, by throwing a little of the mixture on to water. The chicory\r\nsinks at once, whereas the coffee floats for a while because it is\r\noily. In pure coffee there should be no starch and the iodine test will\r\nreadily show whether we are dealing with a sample free from starch or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nMustard is very rarely purposely mixed with any impurities, in fact it\r\nis probably the least likely to be adulterated of any article of food.\r\nUnder the microscope a large number of small objects, very similar to\r\nstarch grains, can be seen. They are the cells containing mustard oil\r\nand they are not stained blue by iodine. A specimen of pure mustard\r\ncontains no starch. Pepper is by no means easy to test for impurities.\r\nIt contains minute starch grains, which can be recognised under the\r\nmicroscope after staining. It is mentioned here because of a very\r\ninteresting and easily performed experiment that will appeal to every\r\nmicroscopist. Place a little pepper on a clean slide and moisten it\r\nwith a drop of alcohol, allow it to stand for a minute or so then add\r\na little dilute glycerine, cover the specimen with a cover glass and\r\nexamine it under the microscope after the lapse of about five minutes.\r\nThe sight of wonderful prismatic crystals forming one by one in rapid\r\nsuccession will be ample reward for the trouble taken. A drop of\r\nstrong nitric acid, which must not be allowed to come in contact with\r\nany part of the microscope or with one’s hands or clothes, will turn\r\nthe crystals a rich orange colour. The crystals are composed of a\r\nsubstance called piperine.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows of the importance of pure water for drinking purposes\r\nbut the word pure in this case is used in a very wide sense, for the\r\nonly really pure water is distilled water and it would not form a very\r\ngood beverage. Although ordinary tap water may contain a number of\r\nimpurities it is not easy to see them without taking a little trouble.\r\nIf our tap water is so contaminated that a drop, examined at random,\r\nshows us all manner of solid matter floating in the water there must be\r\nsomething seriously wrong. Those who are engaged in testing water under\r\nthe microscope, first take a big jug full of the water and allow it to\r\nstand for twenty-four hours, covering it the while to keep out dust. At\r\nthe end of this time most of the water is carefully drawn off, from the\r\ntop, with a siphon and the remainder, after stirring is poured into a\r\nconical glass and allowed to stand for a further twelve hours. Then the\r\nupper portion of the water is again siphoned off and a little of the\r\nremainder, which is left in the point of the conical glass is drawn by\r\nsuction into a special kind of glass tube, called a pipette. This final\r\nsample contains all the solid matter which settles to the bottom of the\r\nwater after standing for thirty-six hours.\r\n\r\nThe impurities likely to be present in water make such a formidable\r\nlist that we can only mention a small number. There may be various\r\nmineral substances, such as lime, sand or clay; vegetable substances,\r\nstarch grains, fragments of wood, pieces of decayed leaves and the\r\nlike or there may be hair, scales of fish, etc. The impurities may\r\nbe living plants, of which the most likely to be found are bacteria,\r\ndiatoms, desmids and Volvox, amongst plants, and rotifers, Vorticella,\r\nParamœcium, Amœba, also portions of tapeworms and their eggs amongst\r\nanimals. These creatures are all described elsewhere so we need not\r\ndwell on their peculiarities here.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all of the above and many more not mentioned there are\r\nfour metals commonly found in impure water, either in small solid\r\nparticles, or in the form of one of their compounds soluble in water.\r\nThe metals are iron, copper, zinc and lead. Very simple chemical tests\r\nwill show whether they are present or not. To a drop of the water add a\r\nvery minute quantity of hydrochloric acid and of potassium ferrocyanide\r\nsolution. When iron is present the solution will turn blue; in the\r\npresence of copper it will become bronze coloured, whilst zinc turns\r\nit a milky white. To detect lead, take another drop of water and add a\r\nvery small quantity of potassium chromate solution. If the suspected\r\nimpurity is present the solution turns yellow. All the chemicals for\r\nthese simple tests may be obtained at any chemists and there is this\r\ngreat advantage in testing under the microscope--only very small\r\nquantities are required.\r\n\r\nButter can hardly be described as an interesting object for the\r\nmicroscope, nevertheless, it may be of use to explain the methods of\r\nits examination. A small sample should be placed upon a clean slide, a\r\ndrop of olive oil added and the whole covered with a cover slip which\r\nmay be pressed firmly till the specimen forms but a thin layer. Of\r\ncourse the most important impurities likely to be present are bacteria\r\nbut these we cannot see without special preparation and we are not\r\ndealing with bacteria in the present chapter.\r\n\r\nIf our specimen is in a film sufficiently thin to be transparent, and\r\nwe should have made it so by pressure on the cover slip, we may first\r\nof all examine it carefully for starch grains which, by the way, should\r\nbe absent. The amount and size of the drops of water, which every\r\nbutter sample contains, are of importance in deciding its quality.\r\nIn good butter there are a few scattered drops of various sizes; in\r\nmilk-blended butter the water globules are all very small and all\r\nof the same size, or as nearly so as the eye can judge; in butter\r\ncontaining an excessive amount of water the drops appear large, much\r\nlarger than in a normal sample.\r\n\r\nIf we examine various samples, we shall find that some are much more\r\ntransparent than others, the transparent samples being fresh butter.\r\nThe curd also in fresh samples is much more finely and evenly scattered\r\nin the field of view than in older samples. Renovated butter, that\r\nis to say rancid butter which has been melted and made palatable by\r\nforcing steam through it, should be examined by oblique light--easily\r\narranged by tilting the mirror at an angle--when the curd appears as\r\nwhite patches on a dark background.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that one article of food, honey, is more likely to be\r\npure when it contains impurities. This sounds like a bull but a great\r\ndeal of honey is manufactured from various sugars but not by bees. This\r\nartificial honey contains no pollen grains, in fact any honey found to\r\nbe free of pollen should be looked upon with suspicion. Starch often\r\noccurs in artificial honey, never in real bee-made honey.\r\n\r\nTo many foods adulterants are added as preservatives, the nature and\r\nquantity of such additions is settled by Act of Parliament. Many foods\r\nare preserved with small quantities of Borax or Boric Acid. The use of\r\nFormaldehyde, formerly sold under the German trade name of Formalin,\r\nis not unknown but it is very injurious. Salicylic Acid which was\r\nformerly much used is being supplanted by Benzoic Acid, for the reason\r\nthat the latter is not so easily detected and therefore prosecution for\r\nexcessive quantities is not so likely to follow. These preservatives\r\nare not easily detected by the microscopist unless he be a chemist also.\r\n\r\nAs we have already remarked adulterants are added for the sake of\r\ncolour, either because the public demand certain colours, or to hide\r\nfraud. Milk for instance, when watered, assumes a characteristic\r\nblue colour; to hide the blue shade various dyes, anetto, turmeric or\r\ncarrot juice are added or one of the aniline dyes, products of coal\r\ntar. This form of deception became so common that now the public demand\r\nyellow milk and butter. Jams made from inferior or over-ripe fruit\r\nare frequently coloured with coal tar dyes, so also are cheap sweets.\r\nOxide of iron is added to potted meats, sauces, etc., to improve\r\ntheir appearance. Bottled peas, which if untreated would be of a\r\nyellowish-green colour, are made to appear bright green by the addition\r\nof the poisonous blue vitriol; fortunately this chemical unites with\r\nthe chlorophyll of the peas to form a compound which is insoluble\r\nin the human body and so no great harm is done. We may compare the\r\nchlorophyll in a healthy, undoctored green pea with that in a pea which\r\nhas been treated with blue vitriol; under the microscope we shall\r\nnotice the striking difference between the two.\r\n\r\nWhen we admire the beautiful crystals which go to the making of a piece\r\nof lump sugar we little dream that, if those crystals were pure they\r\nwould be yellow. The housewife, however, demands her lump sugar white\r\nso ultramarine is added to mask the yellow colour and give the sugar\r\nits white appearance.\r\n\r\nMost of these impurities are difficult or impossible of detection\r\nunder the microscope; they are added to give the food a more pleasing\r\nappearance in the first place, for there are undoubtedly certain\r\npeople who prefer to consume food which appeals to the eye, though of\r\ndoubtful purity, rather than unadulterated though perfectly pure fare.\r\nWhen added solely for the sake of appearance it matters little, but the\r\nhabit of making these additions is frequently cultivated to hide bad\r\nmaterial and imperfections in manufacture.\r\n\r\nSometimes adulterants find their way by accident into our food. A good\r\nmany years ago numbers of people were poisoned by drinking beer, in\r\nsome cases with fatal results. Tests were made and the beer was found\r\nto contain arsenic but how it got there remained a mystery. At length\r\nthe glucose, a kind of sugar used in making beer and added also to a\r\ngood many of our foods, was found to contain the substance. Now in\r\nthe making of glucose, sulphuric acid is used and in this particular\r\ncase the impure or commercial acid had been taken. This impure acid\r\nfrequently contains arsenic and, in the case we mention, the results of\r\nits use were disastrous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nBACTERIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is probably no scientific work more wedded to the microscope than\r\nthe study of bacteria. We may learn a great deal about birds or insects\r\nor rocks or minerals, without any instrument but we can learn little of\r\nthe bacteria unless they are highly magnified.\r\n\r\nThere is such an extraordinary amount of misconception concerning\r\nbacteria that, it will be time well spent if we attempt to clear up\r\nall misunderstanding at the start. Bacteria, often called microbes\r\nor germs, are looked upon with considerable awe by most people, who\r\nassociate them in some vague way with disease. There is no denying\r\nthat many bacteria are responsible for certain diseases; many more are\r\nperfectly harmless and a goodly number are exceedingly useful.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate all the bacterial activities would require a large book\r\nbut briefly, apart from the disease-causing bacteria, they enter into\r\nthe manufacture of cheese and butter, of wine and vinegar; they are\r\nessential to brewing and tanning; they act as scavengers over the face\r\nof the earth, breaking up a mass of decaying animal and vegetable\r\nmatter into simple chemical substances which can then be used again as\r\nfood for plants; some of them also can take a gas called nitrogen, from\r\nthe air, and pass it on to green plants.\r\n\r\nWhat are these active little creatures? The question is a natural one.\r\nThey are merely very minute, one-celled plants. Each one possesses\r\na firm cell-wall, filled with living matter; in an earlier chapter,\r\nwe described the one called protean animalcule and, although it was\r\ncomposed of but a single cell it had no definite wall. This is one of\r\nthe essential differences between plants and animals, both of them are\r\nmade up of one or more, maybe millions of cells, but each plant cell\r\nis surrounded by a well-defined wall, animal cells have no such walls.\r\nThe exact position of the bacteria in the plant world is still open to\r\ndoubt. Most scientists place them amongst the fungi; for, with very few\r\nexceptions they possess no chlorophyll. One or two of them, however,\r\ndo possess a green colouring matter which, if not chlorophyll is very\r\nnear to it; on this account other scientists are of the opinion that\r\nthey are related to the seaweeds. It is a matter, however, that does\r\nnot concern us very deeply, for our purpose it is sufficient to know\r\nthat they are plants. When they were discovered, nearly three hundred\r\nand twenty-five years ago, they were looked upon as minute animals\r\nand it is curious that the belief has survived this long period of\r\ntime in the popular mind. Long before the activities of bacteria were\r\nconnected with various phenomena, such as infectious diseases, souring\r\nof milk, etc., it was thought that these changes were brought about by\r\nchemical action. Like many of the early theories, this one contained a\r\nhalf truth, for a great many of the changes brought about by bacteria\r\nare really due to chemical action initiated by the organisms. In other\r\nwords, the bacteria set free certain substances which actually cause\r\nthe changes to take place.\r\n\r\nLet us make our statement clear by a simple experiment. To a little\r\nfresh milk we add a weak acid, the milk curdles at once and by dipping\r\na piece of litmus paper (obtained at any chemist’s) into the mixture,\r\nit will turn red, showing the presence of acid. Litmus, by the way, is\r\nobtained from a lichen; in the presence of acid it is red, an alkali,\r\nthe opposite of an acid, turns it blue. In a neutral solution, that is\r\nto say one that is neither acid nor alkaline, litmus is of a purplish\r\nhue.\r\n\r\nTo continue our experiment, we allow another sample of the same milk\r\nto stand for a day or two in a warm, dark place and again the milk\r\nwill be curdled. A test with the litmus will show that the solution is\r\nacid. The bacteria themselves have not curdled the milk but they have\r\nliberated a substance, called a ferment, which has split up part of\r\nthe milk into an acid, amongst other things and that acid has actually\r\ndone the curdling. For this reason, weak alkalies are sometimes added\r\nto milk. Acids and alkalies, of equal strength form neutral solutions,\r\nso that, when the milk bacteria begin their activities which result\r\nin the formation of acid, it is at once made neutral by the alkali.\r\nBy this means, curdling is postponed for a little while, though there\r\ncomes a time, of course, when all the alkali is used up, then the acid\r\ngains the upper hand and curdling takes place. We could if we wished\r\ncontinue adding more and more alkali to keep pace with the formation of\r\nacid, but too much alkali would be as unpalatable as too much acid, so\r\nnothing would be gained.\r\n\r\nBefore we bring out our microscope to examine these lowly plants, we\r\nwill first of all kill a myth which has survived, in the non-scientific\r\nmind, since the eighteenth century and then describe briefly the life\r\nhistory of a typical bacterium. Now for the myth. Bacteria are so\r\nminute, their activities so great and the results of their activities\r\nso far reaching, that it is hardly surprising to learn that, even at\r\nthe present day, bacteria are supposed simply “to happen.” We talk of\r\nthunder turning milk sour, but thunder can no more sour milk than can\r\na passing train or an air raid or a burst in a water main. True, milk\r\nturns sour more quickly in thundery weather than in frosty weather,\r\nbecause, when thunder threatens, the air is warm and the milk-souring\r\nbacteria increase more rapidly in warm weather than in cold. We must\r\nremember always that bacteria are living beings and in common with all\r\nother living things they must have parents. What probably took place\r\nat the beginning of the world we cannot consider here but one thing is\r\ncertain that, at the present day, no living matter is produced from\r\nnon-living matter; “life from life” is the only theory that will stand\r\nscientific tests and this has been the case ever since the simplest\r\nmicroscopes were thought of and thousands of years before that. Any\r\nsubstance, however liable to decay, if rendered germ free and kept germ\r\nfree, will retain its fresh condition indefinitely. Could bacteria\r\nor germs, call them what you will, simply happen it would be useless\r\nattempting to fight against them.\r\n\r\nBacteria are everywhere. In the water we drink, in the milk, butter,\r\ncheese and in dust. We cannot avoid them, try as we will; it is\r\nfortunate, therefore, that the majority are harmless. You may be\r\nsurprised that, with this ubiquity, you have never seen one. When,\r\nhowever, you learn that most of them are only about twenty-five\r\nthousandths of an inch long and that a thousand million of them could\r\nbe packed comfortably into a little box, whose sides measured but a\r\ntwenty-fifth of an inch in length, it is not really so surprising\r\nafter all. Being so small, the activities of a single bacterium are\r\ninsignificant; that “union is strength” was never better exemplified\r\nthan amongst these lowly plants. There are no male and female bacteria,\r\nin the majority of cases they increase by splitting, in fact they\r\nare often called splitting plants. The change may be watched under\r\nthe microscope. The plant elongates somewhat, it becomes narrower\r\nand narrower in the middle, it develops a waist in fact; finally the\r\ntwo halves part company and each one leads a separate existence as\r\na bacterium. This splitting progresses at an extraordinary rate. A\r\ncelebrated scientist once wrote: “Let us assume that a microbe divides\r\ninto two within an hour, these two into four in the next hour, these\r\nagain into eight in the third hour and so on. The number of microbes\r\nthus produced in 24 hours would exceed 16-1/2 millions; in two\r\ndays they would increase to 47 trillions, and in a week the number\r\nexpressing them would be made up of 51 figures. At the end of a day (24\r\nhours) the microbes descended from a single individual would occupy one\r\nfortieth of a hollow cube with edges one twenty-fifth of an inch long,\r\nbut at the end of the following day would fill a space of twenty-seven\r\ncubic inches, and in less than five days their volume would equal\r\nthat of the ocean.” It is hardly necessary to add that these alarming\r\nfigures represent what would happen if no accident befell the bacteria,\r\nthey show the enormous vitality possessed by the smallest of all\r\nplants. Even allowing for misadventure their increase is alarming;\r\nactual tests, with a sample of milk containing originally 153,000\r\nbacteria per cubic inch, show that the cubic inch contained after one\r\nhour, 539,750; after two hours, 616,250; after seven hours, 1,020,000;\r\nafter nine hours 2,040,000 and after 25 hours 85,000,000 individuals.\r\n\r\nThe writer whom we have just quoted calculated that a single bacterium\r\nweighs about 0.000,000,000,024,243,672 of a grain, that forty thousand\r\nmillions weigh one grain and that two hundred and eighty-nine billions\r\nweigh a pound. The descendants of one bacterium weigh 1/2666 of a\r\ngrain, after twenty-four hours; more than a pound after two days, and\r\nsixteen and a half million pounds after three days. The assumption in\r\nthis case, also, is that no harm comes to any of them; the mortality\r\namongst bacteria is, clearly, very great.\r\n\r\nSometimes, owing to external conditions, such as lack of food certain\r\nbacteria produce spores. The power of spore formation is not possessed\r\nby all bacteria and those which are able to bring it about are\r\ndifficult to kill for the spores, which contain the living material\r\nof the bacterium are surrounded with walls which will resist boiling,\r\ndrying, freezing and all manner of ill treatment. The spore formation\r\nof bacteria is very simple, all or part of the living contents of the\r\nbacterium becomes surrounded by a tough wall and remains so surrounded\r\ntill circumstances are favourable, when the wall bursts, its contents\r\nescapes and becomes a bacterium, capable of founding a new colony by\r\nthe method of splitting we have already described.\r\n\r\nNow let us try to find out what sort of plants we are to look for, when\r\nwe are searching for bacteria, under our microscope. They exist in many\r\nforms, to which special names have been applied, and it is unfortunate\r\nthat, very often, their external form varies according to their state,\r\nthus a bacterium may be spherical when young and rod shaped when older.\r\nSome bacteria are spherical and are known as _Cocci_ or _Micrococci_,\r\nfrom Greek words meaning a berry or a little berry respectively;\r\nsometimes these spherical bacteria occur in pairs, then they are called\r\n_Diplococci_ (double berries); or in chains, _Streptococci_ (chain\r\nberries); or in bunches, _Staphylococci_ (grape berries). They may\r\nresemble short rods, when they are called _Bacteria_, a name, by the\r\nway, which is also applied generally to all microbes; they may, on the\r\nother hand, have the appearance of longer rods and then they are called\r\n_Bacilli_. Some of these longer rods may be curved or even corkscrew\r\nshaped when they are known by the name of _Spirilla_. Rather fearsome\r\nnames some of these we fear and we wished to avoid long names, but they\r\nappear over and over again in books and papers relating to bacteria so\r\nwe are compelled to introduce them to our pages. Many bacteria possess\r\nno power of movement, others swim rapidly, by the aid of the lashing\r\nmovement of little whip-like structures with which they are furnished.\r\n\r\nAfter all this preamble, which we hope has cleared up certain\r\nmisconceptions regarding bacteria and has given the reader some insight\r\ninto their habits, we may proceed to the examination of some of the\r\nplants themselves. At the outset we have a confession to make. Bacteria\r\ncan only be studied seriously, by those who possess very expensive\r\nand elaborate apparatus; considerable technical skill is required\r\nto prepare the plants for examination--many of them indeed can only\r\nbe seen after they have been stained and lastly, to trifle with the\r\ndisease-causing members of the family may lead to dangerous if not\r\nfatal results.\r\n\r\nHaving issued our warning let us see what we can do in the way of\r\nmicroscopic investigation. The easiest subject with which to make a\r\nstart is the Hay Bacillus, _Bacillus Subtilis_, not because it is the\r\nlargest of the bacteria by any means, but because it is very easily\r\nobtained. Each plant measures about five thousandths of an inch in\r\nlength, so we shall require a high magnification to examine it. Having\r\nobtained a small quantity of hay, we must boil it in water for about\r\nthree-quarters of an hour and then set it aside for some hours. In due\r\ncourse the water will contain hundreds upon hundreds of bacteria or,\r\nspeaking more correctly, of bacilli. For our work, we shall require a\r\nspecial kind of microscope slide; instead of the piece of plain glass\r\nwe have been accustomed to use we must obtain one with a circular\r\nportion, hollowed out from the centre. Having done so, we take a clean\r\nglass rod and, with it, transfer a drop of the water, containing the\r\nbacilli, to the centre of a clean coverslip. Invert the coverslip so\r\nthat the drop is on the lower surface and place it over the hollow\r\nportion of the slide, in such a manner that the drop still remains\r\nsuspended from the coverslip; this is known as the hanging-drop method\r\nand requires some little skill to accomplish satisfactorily. When\r\nour slide is prepared, with a magnification of at least one thousand\r\ndiameters, we may reasonably hope that our trouble will be rewarded.\r\n\r\nAt first we shall probably see nothing. We recall that we had some\r\ndifficulty in examining starch grains, on account of the fact that they\r\nwere colourless. This time we are dealing with a far more difficult\r\nsubject. When our eyes become accustomed to the light, however, we\r\nshall be conscious that there is something moving in our drop of\r\nwater. The Hay Bacillus is one of the moving forms, each individual\r\nis furnished with a number of little whips whose lashings enable it\r\nto travel through the water. The whips cannot be seen in unstained\r\nbacilli; experience, however, tells us that they are there, for all\r\nthese lowly plants which show movement are seen when stained, to\r\npossess the little whips. The process of staining kills the plants so\r\nthat we cannot see the little whips in action.\r\n\r\nHaving detected that movement is taking place, a little adjustment of\r\nfocus and a further search will reveal the bacilli to us, as little\r\nrod-like, colourless individuals. We shall see their cell contents if\r\nthey are sufficiently highly magnified and also their cell walls. We\r\nmay even observe them splitting, each one into two individuals. We must\r\nkeep our sample of water for later examination. In fact, we may examine\r\ndrops from day to day, in exactly the same manner. After a short\r\nlapse of time we shall notice that the bacteria have increased to an\r\nalarming extent and also that they no longer swim about. At this period\r\nthey tend to arrange themselves in chains lengthwise, their cell walls\r\nalso lose their clear cut appearance and become jelly like, yet withal\r\nthey may still continue to split up.\r\n\r\nIf we now examine the water from which we have taken our drop we\r\nshall probably find a scum floating on the surface; it consists of\r\nmillions upon millions of hay bacilli, huddled together so to speak.\r\nIt is the beginning of the end for them, nourishment is becoming\r\nscarce and important changes are about to take place. Let us continue\r\nour examination day by day, that we may discover what is happening.\r\nBefore long, we shall find that within each cell wall, which is no\r\nlonger jelly like, there is a darker cell contents than we saw before.\r\nThe bacilli have, in fact, formed spores. Now we may plug our bottle\r\ncontaining the remainder of the water, with cotton wool and set it\r\naside for some months if we wish. At the end of that time, by pouring a\r\nfresh supply of water upon the spores, we may start them all into a new\r\nvitality and the whole process will be repeated.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned that bacteria should be stained, in order to make\r\ntheir presence more easily detected. This is hardly the place to enter\r\ninto a lengthy discussion concerning the methods of staining but, for\r\nthe benefit of our readers, who wish to pursue the subject further,\r\nwe will state as concisely as possible how simple staining may be\r\naccomplished. Our requirements are, a pair of Cornet’s forceps, two\r\nsmall bottles of stain, say Carbol-Fuchsin and Methylene Blue and a\r\nlarger bottle of 1/2 per cent. Acetic acid; these may be obtained from\r\nthe firm who supplied our microscope and, for the beginner at anyrate,\r\nit is cheaper to buy the solutions ready made, than to attempt to make\r\nthem up at home. Slides and cover slips, we require, of course, and\r\nthey must be absolutely grease proof; it may be necessary to boil them\r\nin a strong solution of caustic soda to effect this result. A small\r\nbottle of Canada Balsam completes our requirements.\r\n\r\nShould we wish to examine a drop of milk for bacteria, we proceed in\r\nthis manner. With the aid of the Cornet’s forceps pick up two cover\r\nslips, place a drop of milk on one and cover with the other. With\r\nthumb and finger bring the glasses into close contact, so that the\r\nmilk forms a thin film. Slide one glass from the other and set aside,\r\nmilk side upwards, till dry. Next take each cover slip, separately, in\r\nthe forceps and pass rapidly two or three times through the flame of a\r\nspirit lamp, this fixes the bacteria, if any be present, to the glass.\r\nNow having poured a little of the stain, say methylene blue, into a\r\nshallow vessel, a saucer will do, we place our cover slips therein for\r\ntwo minutes or so. Then, remove them with the forceps, wash in water\r\ntill no more stain comes away and set aside to dry. When dry, take a\r\nclean slide, place a small drop of Canada Balsam at its centre and\r\ngently lower the cover slip thereon, stained side downwards. If we now\r\nexamine our slide under a high magnification, we shall easily be able\r\nto see whether bacteria are present or not. Should our preparation be\r\ntoo deeply stained, a good slide will show the bacteria stained blue\r\nagainst an almost colourless background, we must immerse our second\r\npreparation for a few moments in a little of the 1/2 per cent. acetic\r\nacid which will have the effect of removing the excess of stain; then,\r\nafter washing and drying, we proceed as before.\r\n\r\nBeautiful double staining may be performed by the following method.\r\nIn addition to the chemicals we already possess we shall require\r\nsome 5 per cent. acetic acid. Double staining is especially useful\r\nfor spore-forming bacteria, so we may take some of the Hay Bacillus\r\nat sporing time. Proceed exactly as described above substituting, of\r\ncourse, a drop of water known to contain the bacilli for the drop of\r\nmilk. When the two cover slips are ready for staining, warm some of\r\nthe Carbol-Fuchsin in a saucer and leave the cover slip therein for\r\nfive minutes, then transfer to a 5 per cent. solution of Acetic Acid\r\ntill all the stain appears to be removed, afterwards wash in water. The\r\ncover slips must next be immersed for a few minutes, two should be long\r\nenough, in Methylene blue solution, then washed and, when dry, mounted\r\non a slide with Canada Balsam, as described above. If the staining has\r\nbeen properly carried out, we shall have a most beautiful preparation,\r\nshowing spores stained red and the rest of the bacilli blue.\r\n\r\nThe work that may be done with bacteria is limitless but, to advance\r\nvery far, we shall need facilities for obtaining what are known as\r\n“pure cultures.” Let us make the term clear. Suppose we take milk,\r\nwater, butter, anything in fact upon which bacteria will grow and\r\nexamine them carefully. If we have the requisite knowledge and\r\nrecognise what we see, we shall find not one kind of bacterium but\r\na number of different bacteria. Now by certain manipulations, which\r\nneed not be described here, all the different kinds of bacteria may\r\nbe sorted out, so that we have colonies consisting of one kind of\r\nbacterium only and such a colony is known as a “pure culture.”\r\n\r\nIn practice, bacteriologists do not use the rough and ready methods\r\nthat we used in dealing with the Hay Bacillus. They prepare pure\r\ncultures and cultivate the bacteria on various substances, differing\r\nmarkedly from those on which they originally lived. For example, a\r\njelly-like substance, mainly composed of beef broth and gelatine is one\r\nof the favourite substances on which to grow bacteria, milk is also\r\nused in some cases and also slices of potato. All this may seem to have\r\nlittle to do with the microscope, but indeed the bacteriologist relies\r\nas much on the behaviour of his pure cultures, growing on gelatine,\r\netc., as on their appearance under the microscope. Some bacteria will\r\nnot grow on the surface of the gelatine but only in the body of the\r\nsubstance, where air cannot reach them; others cause the gelatine\r\nto become liquid; others give off a characteristic smell or impart\r\na well-marked colour to their food material; a few even cause the\r\ngelatine to become luminous. These easily seen characters are quite\r\nas typical of the various bacteria which bring them about as are the\r\nmicroscopic characters; in fact it sometimes happens that only by a\r\ncombination of the two is it possible to be certain of what one has\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nMEDICAL WORK WITH THE MICROSCOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the medical man, a microscope is all important. In the first place\r\nit is absolutely necessary for him to have an accurate knowledge of\r\nthe human body; he must be able to recognise healthy blood, he must\r\nknow the varied cells composing muscle and bone, etc. Then again the\r\nmedical aspect of bacteriology is all important; we have devoted a\r\nseparate chapter to bacteria and there we warned our readers not to\r\nlook upon all bacteria as harmful, nevertheless, the harmful ones are\r\nall important in medical work.\r\n\r\nOf recent years a knowledge of the structure and habits of certain\r\ninsects has become an important branch of medicine for many of these\r\ncreatures carry diseases from one patient to another. This branch of\r\nmedicine is more important in the tropics than in this country, for\r\nmost of the really harmful insects live in warm countries.\r\n\r\nA number of lowly animals claim attention from the medical man for\r\nthey are parasites of the human body; many fungi, too, cause disease. A\r\ncertain amount of chemical work with the microscope also falls to the\r\nlot of the medical man.\r\n\r\nWe have stated many times in our pages that, both plants and animals,\r\nare made up of one or more cells and that the cells of plants are each\r\nsurrounded by a more or less rigid cell wall, whilst those of animals\r\nhave no definite cell wall. As a start in our medical investigations we\r\nmay examine some cells from our own person. There is no need for alarm,\r\nthe operation is quite painless. After having prepared our microscope\r\nand got ready a clean slide, on which we place a drop of clean water,\r\nwe must take some clean, blunt instrument such as a tooth-brush handle\r\nand gently scrape the inside of the cheek. Having done so, dip the part\r\nof the tooth-brush with which the scraping has been done, in the drop\r\nof water, then cover the water with a cover slip.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of our object with a fairly high magnification\r\nwill show that, though the scraping was very gentle and quite painless,\r\nsomething has been removed from the mouth. We shall see a number of\r\ncells, somewhat overlapping like the tiles of a roof. They are almost\r\ncolourless, and have ill-defined margins, certainly no cell wall, and\r\neach cell contains a dark spot near its centre. These cells from our\r\nown person will give us a good idea of the appearance of animal cells,\r\nfor we are animals, much as we may dislike the idea. The dark spot\r\nin the middle of each cell is called a nucleus, it is the most active\r\npart of the cell and when the latter is about to divide, as it does\r\nwhen growth takes place, the nucleus always divides first.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1. CRYSTALS FROM HUMAN BLOOD\r\n\r\n    It is often possible to identify the source of blood by means of\r\n    crystals which can be obtained from it, for each race of animal has\r\n    its own special form of blood crystal. The large crystal at the\r\n    margin exhibits the typical shape.\r\n\r\n  2. CRYSTALS FROM THE BLOOD OF THE BABOON\r\n\r\n    These show some resemblance to human blood.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nNow we may perform another operation upon ourselves, rather more\r\npainful than the last one but not very serious. We wish to examine some\r\nhuman blood, so we tie a handkerchief tightly round one of our fingers\r\nand with a clean needle--be sure that it is clean--make a puncture in\r\nthe finger tip. The handkerchief bandage will prevent our feeling any\r\npain. We must put the drop of blood we have obtained in the centre of\r\na clean slide and examine it under the microscope. While the blood is\r\nstill liquid, we shall see a number of circular discs floating about,\r\nthey are very small being only 1/3200 inch in diameter. The centre of\r\neach disc appears darker than the rim, but this darker shade is only\r\napparent. Using a term we introduced in our chapter on the lens, we\r\nmay call the discs double concave. Now let us watch our objects for a\r\nmoment and we shall notice that they begin to arrange themselves in\r\nchains, they appear like a number of draughtsmen placed one upon the\r\nother, our drop of blood is now beginning to clot. A simple experiment\r\nmay be attempted at this stage; we must run a drop of water on to our\r\nlittle blood discs and watch carefully what happens. We shall see that\r\nthey change their shape gradually, from being double concave they\r\nbecome flat sided, and this is not all, for they continue to change\r\ntill both sides bulge outwards and they may be described as double\r\nconvex.\r\n\r\nThese little discs are known as red blood corpuscles. Their shape is\r\nsome indication of the animal to which they belong; those of man, as we\r\nhave seen, are circular and so are those of most of the higher animals,\r\nexcept the camel tribe, which has oval, red blood corpuscles. Birds,\r\nreptiles and fishes have corpuscles agreeing in shape with those of\r\nthe camel. In size there is a great deal of difference between the\r\ncorpuscles of various animals; a member of the deer family has the\r\nsmallest and a creature related to our Newts, called Proteus, has the\r\nlargest. The size of the blood corpuscles bears no relation to the size\r\nof the animal to which they belong, those of the frog measure 1/1108\r\ninch, or nearly three times the size of the red blood corpuscles of\r\nman. Without much difficulty it should be possible to obtain other\r\nsamples of blood and the red corpuscles should always be examined,\r\nneedless to say the blood should always be in a fresh condition. In\r\naddition to the red corpuscles we may notice a few smaller circular\r\nbodies, they are the white corpuscles. If we have any difficulty\r\nin finding them in our own blood, we can examine another specimen\r\nof frog’s blood, in which they are more easily seen. It has been\r\ncalculated that in a cubic inch of blood from a healthy human being\r\nthere are eighty millions of red and a quarter of a million of white\r\nblood corpuscles. Although there is such an enormous difference in the\r\nsizes of red corpuscles from various animals, the white corpuscles\r\nare remarkably constant, measuring about 1/3000 inch in warm-blooded\r\nanimals and 1/2500 inch in reptiles. Sometimes, as we are examining\r\nthe white blood corpuscles under the microscope, we shall notice that\r\nthey behave in a similar manner to the Proteus Animalcule, which we\r\ndescribed in our chapter on Pond Life. A kind of creeping motion takes\r\nplace and the corpuscle loses its circular shape. In our own blood this\r\nmovement lasts but a very few moments, in frogs’ blood, by keeping our\r\nslide moderately warm, we may witness the movement for some time.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly easy to watch the circulation of blood in the foot of a\r\nfrog. For this purpose we require a piece of apparatus known as a frog\r\nplate, this is merely a flat brass plate perforated with a number of\r\nholes, through which tape is passed to bind the frog down and having\r\nalso a hole the size of the opening in the microscope stage, into which\r\na circle of glass is usually fitted. Such a plate may be made of wood\r\nand will serve our purpose quite as well as the more expensive brass\r\nplate. We must bind our frog firmly, but not too tightly with wet rag,\r\nleaving one leg exposed. This free leg must now be fastened in such a\r\nmanner that one of the webs between its toes comes over the opening\r\nin the plate, finally the toes must be carefully tied with string so\r\nthat they remain apart and the web is fully expanded. Having fixed\r\nour frog in a satisfactory position let us examine his blood-vessels\r\nunder a fairly high power. We shall find that there are large and small\r\nvessels in his webbed foot; we will devote our observation to the\r\nsmall vessels, called capillaries, from the Latin _Capillus_, a hair,\r\nbecause of their small size. Probably the blood will not flow when we\r\nmake our first examination and this points to one of two things, either\r\nthe frog is bound too tightly or he has not recovered from the alarm\r\nhe experienced at his treatment. In the latter event he will not be\r\nlong recovering and his blood circulation will soon be in full working\r\norder; in the former case, we must loosen his bandages. In some of the\r\nvery small blood-vessels we shall notice that the blood always flows\r\nin one direction, in others it does not appear to have any definite\r\ndirection. In either case, however, we can see the red corpuscles\r\nflowing rapidly along the central stream of the blood-vessel whilst the\r\nwhite corpuscles travel much more slowly along the sides.\r\n\r\nThe medical man may be called upon to decide two questions concerning\r\nhuman blood; he may wish to know whether it is healthy and, in the case\r\nof certain crimes, he must be able to state positively whether certain\r\nstains are caused by human blood or not. Dealing with these questions\r\nin order, let us see how we would proceed. There are many people, far\r\ntoo many in towns who are described as bloodless, the expression is of\r\ncourse an exaggeration for no bloodless person could continue to exist.\r\nWhat really happens is that such people are deficient in red blood\r\ncorpuscles. If we examine two samples of blood, one from a perfectly\r\nhealthy subject and one from a so-called bloodless subject we shall\r\nprobably not be able to detect any difference between the two, but the\r\nexperienced medical man will soon see that one sample has too few red\r\nblood corpuscles.\r\n\r\nAn unhealthy state of the blood is often indicated by the shape\r\nof the blood crystals. Let us see how we may obtain some of these\r\ncrystals. If we add a drop of ether to our drop of blood upon the\r\nslide, and wait a few moments till the ether has evaporated, we shall\r\nnotice when we examine our object again, under a high magnification,\r\nthat a number of prismatic crystals have formed, especially towards\r\nthe edges of the slide. Now in certain diseases of the blood, these\r\ncrystals are no longer formed in their usual shape, thus pointing\r\nout to the medical man that something is amiss. Again there are many\r\nblood parasites just as there are external parasites of man. In the\r\ndisease known as malaria, very small parasites are introduced into\r\nthe blood by mosquitoes. Each of these little parasites enters a red\r\nblood corpuscle, divides up into many smaller individuals, causes the\r\ncorpuscles to burst, then each little parasite attacks more corpuscles.\r\nSome of these little bodies are sucked up, along with the blood of\r\nmalaria patients, by other mosquitoes and, if the insects are of the\r\nparticular kind which spread malaria, the parasites complete their\r\ndevelopment within the mosquito. Patients suffering from that terrible\r\nAfrican malady known as sleeping sickness, have blood parasites\r\nresembling minute eels with long threadlike tails. These parasites are\r\nthe cause of the malady and are introduced into the blood by flies,\r\nclosely related to house flies. There are a very large number of blood\r\nparasites of one kind and another, so it is clear that a knowledge of\r\nblood is very important to the medical man.\r\n\r\nFrom our remarks concerning the sizes of the red corpuscles in the\r\nblood of man and various animals, one might be excused from thinking\r\nthat it would be quite easy for anyone with a little experience to\r\nrecognise human blood. As a matter of fact it is very difficult, it is\r\nalways a doubtful matter to rely upon size alone. We have mentioned\r\nblood crystals and these give us a slightly better clue to the origin\r\nof the blood, for the blood crystals of different animals vary in\r\nshape, far more than their corpuscles. Those of the guinea-pig,\r\nfor example, are little four sided pyramids; those of the mouse,\r\neight sided and so on. Some apes, however, have blood crystals very\r\nsimilar to those of man, so similar that the two may be confused. The\r\nmicroscopist who is compelled to give an opinion concerning the origin\r\nof a sample of blood, especially blood which is some days old, is faced\r\nwith no light task.\r\n\r\nWithout the assistance of the microscope, medical men would never have\r\ndiscovered the cause of many of these insect-borne diseases, they could\r\nnever have traced the development of the blood parasites in the bodies\r\nof insects. For many years it was thought that the disease malaria\r\nwas caused by the damp air of low-lying land, in fact the word malaria\r\nis derived from two Italian words meaning bad air. It was not till the\r\nadvent of the microscope that the true cause of the disease was learned\r\nand the discovery was made that the only connection between the malady\r\nand dampness is that the mosquitoes which carry the disease can only\r\nthrive in damp situations.\r\n\r\nMedical work with the microscope also entails a study of external and\r\ninternal parasites of man other than those which infest the blood.\r\nSome of the larger human parasites we know only too well, they force\r\ntheir unpleasant attentions upon us from time to time, but fortunately\r\nthey are not as a rule serious and are soon got rid of. The cleanest\r\nof us, in these days of universal travel, cannot avoid the visitations\r\nof the lively flea, he is at worst an annoying companion, but he has a\r\ncousin who is responsible for the passing of the germs of the dreaded\r\nplague from rats to man. Plague long remained a mystery, which, without\r\nthe help of the microscope, would probably have remained unsolved to\r\nthis day. Many of these apparently harmless blood-sucking insects may\r\nprove to be disease carriers, as medical knowledge and microscopic\r\ninvestigation is brought to bear upon them.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the smaller external parasites are beyond the reach of\r\nthe amateur microscopist. A number of course are available to medical\r\nstudents, but we write for the ordinary enthusiast and not for the\r\nspecialist. Many interesting little mites, closely allied to the\r\ncheese-mites, cause skin diseases and the creatures themselves as well\r\nas their tunnels in the skin are interesting.\r\n\r\nThere is one little parasite which we nearly all of us carry without\r\nknowing it, and it makes quite an interesting object for the\r\nmicroscope. Its name is _Demodex Folliculorum_ and it dwells in the\r\nsweat glands, especially those round about the nose. It is very minute\r\nand requires a high magnification for its examination. The adult is\r\nworm-like and tapering in the hinder two-thirds of its body, whilst the\r\nfront third, to which is attached four pairs of short, fleshy legs, is\r\nstouter. From the eggs which may be heart or spindle shaped, little\r\nsix-legged grubs arise; later these grubs change into the eight-legged\r\nadults. All the changes take place in the sweat glands, and the\r\ncreatures live with their heads turned away from the gore of the gland.\r\n\r\nTo observe these strange little creatures it is only necessary to\r\nsqueeze some of the white congealed perspiration from one of these\r\nglands on to a slide, coyer it with a drop of oil or xylol and spread\r\nout the object with a needle. By cutting down the light considerably by\r\nmeans of the diaphragm, we shall be able to distinguish all the stages\r\nof these little creatures which, unbidden, share our lives.\r\n\r\nOther parasites come to us in our food and, of these, one of the\r\nmost dangerous is known as _Trichinella Spiralis_ and gives rise to\r\na disease known as trichinosis. We need not give a precise account\r\nof the life history of this interesting worm, it will suffice for\r\nour purpose to know that it finds its way into the bodies of human\r\nbeings, in badly cooked pork or in improperly cured ham or bacon. The\r\nlittle worm is only about 1/25 inch long and, at first, dwells in the\r\nintestines of the pig. Each female produces upwards of fifteen thousand\r\nyoung and these pass into the blood of their host and thence to its\r\nmuscles. Snugly coiled into a spiral between the muscle fibres, each\r\nyoung worm becomes surrounded with a lemon-shaped covering, which is\r\nexceedingly resistant. Suppose now a human being should happen to eat\r\nsuch pork, the juices of the stomach would dissolve the pork and also\r\nthe little case enclosing the parasite. Once set free in the human\r\nbody, the whole proceeding is repeated and, at last, the result is very\r\nsevere muscular pains for the victim. The medical man is called upon to\r\nstudy such parasites as _Trichinella_, and they are not so uncommon as\r\none might think.\r\n\r\nIn addition to animal parasites medical science demands a knowledge\r\nof many disease bringing fungi. One of the commonest is the fungus\r\nresponsible for the unpleasant malady called ringworm. But we have\r\nwritten sufficient to show that the general practitioner needs his\r\nmicroscope always by his side. Not only so but very many instruments he\r\nuses in his work, though called by other names, are really microscopes\r\nadapted for special purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE MICROSCOPE AND AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably there are not many farmers who use a microscope and fewer\r\nstill who use one to help them in their business, yet there are few\r\npeople to whom one of these instruments would be more useful. Their\r\nseeds are often far from pure and the microscope will reveal the\r\nimpurities which may consist of dirt and dust, or of other seeds, seeds\r\nwhich will grow into weeds and make the crop less valuable or, if\r\npresent in large quantities, render it valueless. Agricultural plants\r\nbecome attacked by varied diseases which can only be studied under the\r\nmicroscope; insects also do their share of destruction and much may\r\nbe learned about them when they are magnified. Fungi and insects not\r\nonly attack crops but domestic animals as well. The microscope is an\r\ninvaluable aid in studying the soil, in dairy work and in many other\r\nways closely connected with agriculture.\r\n\r\nThat the testing of agricultural seeds is very important is shown by\r\nthe fact that not very long ago a deputation urged the Government to\r\nestablish a National Seed Testing Station; no further plans have been\r\nmade, however. Seed testing is very interesting work, every seed has\r\nits particular shape and markings and the student soon becomes absorbed\r\nin seeking for weed seeds among the collections he examines. A weed in\r\nthe sense we use it here is not necessarily a harmful plant, it is a\r\nplant in the wrong place. For example a carrot growing in a field of\r\nturnips, though a useful plant would be a weed. When the farmer sowed\r\nturnip seed he did not do so with the object of raising carrots.\r\n\r\nThe only apparatus necessary for the study of most farm seeds is\r\na powerful magnifying glass, one that will enlarge the seeds ten\r\ndiameters or more. When beginning this work, a difficulty occurs at\r\nonce for, without assistance from an expert, it is by no means easy\r\nto learn the names of the seeds one examines. The difficulty can be\r\novercome to a certain extent if we know the names of flowers, for then\r\nwe can collect the seeds from these flowers and we shall have properly\r\nnamed specimens as a guide. Beginning in this way, we shall soon find\r\nthat the seeds can be arranged in groups and there will then be no\r\ndifficulty in recognising say clover seed or grass seed, though much\r\nmore experience will be necessary before we can say to which kind of\r\nclover or grass the seed belongs.\r\n\r\nMany of these seeds are well worth studying, whether we are interested\r\nin seed testing or not. The corn buttercup and the wild carrot have\r\ncurious spined seeds; those of the larkspur when magnified appear to be\r\nstudded with little shreds of paper. White and red campion, have kidney\r\nshaped seeds studded with warts and so similar to one another that\r\nthe microscopist who can distinguish one from the other may consider\r\nhimself something of an expert. Spurrey has lens shaped seeds with\r\nraised equator-like rims. Evening primrose seeds are curious because\r\nthey are found in all sorts of shapes. The seeds of rib-wort plantain\r\nresemble miniature date seeds, others resemble minute bananas, some\r\nare perfectly round, others almost square; some have smooth shining\r\nsurfaces which look as though they had been artificially polished,\r\nothers again are wrinkled and deeply furrowed; but, most curious of all\r\nthe common seeds are those of the cornflower, they resemble nothing\r\nso much as little shaving-brushes, with bright yellow bristles. Many\r\nprofitable hours may be spent in studying the seeds of our common\r\nnative plants, both wild and cultivated.\r\n\r\nThere are two specially obnoxious plants whose seeds may be mixed with\r\nagricultural seed, to the dismay of the farmer. We refer to Broomrape\r\nand Dodder, both of them unable to earn their own living and depending\r\nfor their existence on the robbing of other plants. Broomrape usually\r\nattaches itself to the roots of Hazel, Poplar or Beech and steals its\r\nfood therefrom, but its fleshy pink stems and flowers may sometimes be\r\nseen in clover fields, then clover is its victim.\r\n\r\nMore common and more destructive is the little Dodder, a member of the\r\nConvolvulus family. Its seeds are very minute and when they germinate\r\nthey give rise to a seedling not unlike a piece of wire. With one end\r\nfixed in the ground, the other waves about till it finds a clover plant\r\nround which it twines and not only so but it sends out suckers which\r\nmicroscopic examination shows, penetrate the stem of the clover to rob\r\nits food. By pulling a Dodder stem away from the clover we can clearly\r\nsee a number of holes where the suckers have entered.\r\n\r\nFungus diseases and insects wage constant warfare on the farmer’s\r\nbelongings. That we may better understand the structure of the\r\ndisease-causing fungi we are about to examine, let us refresh our\r\nmemories concerning that very common fungus, known as white mould and\r\nmentioned in an earlier chapter. The reason fungi cause damage to\r\nother plants, the one invariable reason, is that they, being unable\r\nto manufacture food for themselves, steal it from the plants on which\r\nthey grow. Some of them are parasites and steal their food from living\r\nanimals or plants; others live upon dead animal or vegetable matter and\r\nthe white mould is one of the latter fungi.\r\n\r\nIn most of the fungi which concern us we shall find that there is a\r\nmass of minute, thread-like structures forming the main body of the\r\nfungus and that, here and there, portions grow erect and bear spores.\r\nThe spores, it is important to remember, serve the same purpose to the\r\nfungus as seeds to the flowering plants. They are blown or carried\r\nby insects or other agencies to suitable situations for growth, they\r\ngerminate and form new fungi. They are smaller and lighter than the\r\nmost minute and dust-like seeds, so that the slightest breeze scatters\r\nthem far and wide. Let us compare the white mould with a mushroom; at\r\nfirst sight the two plants appear very dissimilar, in reality they\r\nare very similar to one another. The mould forms a thick felt of its\r\nthreads over the substance on which it grows and mushroom spawn if\r\ncarefully examined under a microscope will be found to consist of very\r\nsimilar threads, sealed together to form thicker root-like structures.\r\nThe fungi, however, have no roots and these threads are strictly\r\ncomparable with those of the mould. Here and there the mould sends a\r\nsingle thread into the air and each of these threads is terminated by a\r\nlittle ball which bursts eventually and sets free its contained spores.\r\nThe same thing occurs with the mushroom; we have the upright growth,\r\nnot of a single thread it is true but of a number, welded together to\r\nform a fleshy stalk; at the top there is, not a ball containing spores\r\nbut an umbrella-shaped structure whose under surface is composed of\r\na number of “gills” on which the spores grow at the ends of little\r\nstalks. If a piece of the mushroom stem be torn into its separate\r\ncomponents and examined under the microscope, its similarity to the\r\nmore simple fungus is evident. One of the gills also may be carefully\r\ncut away and examined; the spores will be seen at the end of small\r\nforked stalks.\r\n\r\nHaving progressed thus far in our study of fungus structure, we may\r\nexamine a few of those which cause damage in farm and garden. For the\r\nmost part, the thread-like portion of the fungus grows within the plant\r\nattacked and only the spore bearing portions appear on the surface.\r\nThere is one class of fungus, however, the Mildews in which practically\r\nall the structure grows on the surface, only a few small, unbranched\r\nsuckers penetrate the plant attacked, for the purpose of obtaining\r\nnourishment.\r\n\r\nThough of great interest to the microscopist, the potato disease is\r\noften the cause of serious loss to the farmer. Not only potatoes but\r\nalso tomatoes are attacked. A potato plant suffering from the disease\r\nhas irregular yellowish or brownish spots upon its leaves in the\r\nsummertime. An examination of the lower surface of one of these spotted\r\nleaves will reveal a silvery white margin to each spot. This portion\r\nshould be magnified with a fairly high power and care must be taken\r\nnot to injure the diseased part of the leaf before it is examined. In\r\ncases of serious disease, from nearly every pore on the surface of the\r\nleaf fungus threads will be seen to issue. The threads are branched\r\nand, at the end of each branch, they have a special kind of spore. They\r\nlook not unlike miniature leafless trees and they give the typical\r\nsilvery white appearance to the margins of the diseased spots. When the\r\nspores of potato disease germinate, the young fungus threads enter the\r\nleaf through a pore and for sometime afterwards there is no sign that\r\nthe plant is diseased. On this account potato disease and many other\r\nfungus diseases are rendered more serious in that the farmer is not and\r\ncannot be aware that his crop is attacked till the disease has taken a\r\nfirm hold. Eventually the potatoes themselves become brown, rotten and\r\nbreeding grounds for bacteria.\r\n\r\nA very common plant disease which makes a good study for the\r\nmicroscope, may be found in quantity upon shepherd’s purse, and as\r\nit also attacks cultivated plants of the same family, cabbages,\r\ncauliflowers and the like, it is of no little importance. In its early\r\nstages, the fungus looks like patches of thick white paint upon the\r\nplant and where the fungus grows the plant is invariably contorted. As\r\nthe fungus matures, the skin of the diseased plant splits and a white\r\npowder issues. If some of this powder be highly magnified, it will be\r\nfound to consist of chains of spores, six or seven in a chain. The\r\nspores break off singly and each one may start the disease in another\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe microscopist who hunts in garden and farm for fungus diseases, will\r\nassuredly meet with some examples of that large class known as “smuts.”\r\nThey are so called on account of the black powder with which the\r\nattacked portions of the plants become filled. The smuts are very\r\nimportant but are not of much interest as objects for the microscope,\r\nso we will pass them over for subjects of greater interest if of less\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nEvery farmer knows the familiar and destructive fungus known as “rust\r\nof wheat,” it is one of a large class of most interesting plants.\r\nThe “rusts” are interesting to the microscopist on account of their\r\nstructure and to the botanist because they cannot, like other fungi,\r\ncomplete their lives upon one plant. They derive their popular name\r\nfrom the fact that they look like patches of rust upon the plants on\r\nwhich they live. Some of the greatest living agricultural botanists\r\nhave spent many years on producing races of wheat upon which rust\r\nfungus will not grow. Wonderful success has rewarded their efforts and\r\nconferred immense benefits upon farmers. In spite of this, however, we\r\nneed not despair that we shall be unable to find a specimen for our\r\nmicroscope, though it is happily an undoubted fact that the disease is\r\nnot so common now as a few years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photos by Flatters & Garnett_\r\n\r\n  1.

In the summer, if we examine one of the rust-like\r\npatches on stem or leaf of wheat we shall see that it consists of a\r\ndense bunch of small, short stalks each one of which is terminated\r\nby an oblong red-brown spore. If we keep another patch of the fungus\r\nunder observation, we shall find as the season advances, that instead\r\nof the red-brown patch it has grown darker and darker till it has\r\nbecome almost black. The microscope will show us that the structure\r\nof the spores has altered considerably. There is still the same bunch\r\nof stalks but they have lengthened somewhat and now each spore which\r\nterminates each stalk is divided into two parts by a wall across its\r\nnarrow part. The walls surrounding the spores also appear thicker, as\r\nindeed they are. These are the winter spores, they fall to the ground\r\neventually and there they remain, unharmed by frost or snow or rain,\r\ntill the spring. In the spring they germinate and give rise, not\r\nimmediately to another fungus, as might be expected, but to another\r\nkind of spore. Curiously enough these new spring-formed spores cannot\r\ngrow upon wheat and unless they are carried by wind or some other\r\nagency to a barberry plant their existence is ended. Should they reach\r\na barberry leaf, however, they will germinate, penetrate the leaf and\r\ngrow for a period. Eventually the fungus appears on the lower surface\r\nof the leaf in beautiful structures called cluster cups. Under the\r\nmicroscope, one of these cluster cups forms a lovely object. The leaf\r\nskin is split and below the ruptured skin may be seen a flask-shaped\r\nhollow filled with chains of minute golden-yellow spores. The spores\r\nbreak away, one by one and favoured by fortune, are carried to a\r\nwheat plant where they germinate and give rise to the familiar rust.\r\nAny microscopist anxious for research has a life’s work before him\r\nin tracing the histories of this one class of fungi, should he feel\r\ninclined to shoulder the burden. Very many cluster cups are known and\r\nvery many rusts and all that is required is an enthusiastic mycologist,\r\nas the student of fungi is called, to put the pieces of the puzzle\r\ntogether, so to speak. It is not so very many years ago that the\r\nconnection between the cluster cups of barberry and the rust of wheat\r\nwas quite unthought of.\r\n\r\nWe cannot afford much more space to plant diseases, the farmer has\r\nother troubles and we must mention some of them. We cannot leave the\r\nsubject, however, without a word concerning the mildews. As we have\r\nmentioned, they are curious because they dwell outside the plants they\r\nattack. Rose mildew is unfortunately all too common in every garden, it\r\nmay be recognised as a white powder covering leaves and buds. Under the\r\nmicroscope, in the summer we shall find that it consists of a number of\r\nthread-like structures, not unlike those of the common white mould and\r\nthat there are a number of erect chains of spores. Towards autumn, a\r\nfurther examination will show us many round dark-brown structures from\r\nwhich project a number of minute threads. These brown spheres are the\r\nwinter stage of the fungus, designed to withstand inclement weather.\r\nIn the spring, the spheres burst and set free a number of minute sacs,\r\neach one containing eight spores. The spores germinate on rose leaves\r\nand start the disease anew.\r\n\r\nThere will be no difficulty in finding mildews; they are all very\r\nsimilar to the rose mildew in general but they all differ in detail.\r\nThe gooseberry mildew for example, has a large number of threads\r\nrunning from its winter spheres and each thread is terminated by a\r\nlittle group of branches. The sacs which fall from the opened sphere in\r\nthe spring, only contain four spores in this case.\r\n\r\nThe animal enemies of the farmer, so far as they concern the\r\nmicroscopist are more difficult to study. Many of them are internal\r\nparasites and to gain a real knowledge of their habits and life\r\nhistories necessitates a good deal of rather unpleasant work for which\r\nthe ordinary microscopist has neither the time nor the inclination.\r\n\r\nIn order to give our readers some idea of this work, let us take one of\r\nthe commonest of all agricultural parasites and trace its life history\r\nwhilst giving hints for its examination under the microscope. The\r\ncommon liver fluke is a worm which, in the adult stage, frequents the\r\nliver of some domestic animal, usually the sheep. A friendly butcher\r\nwill probably be able to supply us with a specimen and, when we receive\r\nit, we shall probably dub it a very unwormlike creature. The worms form\r\na large class in the animal kingdom and they do not all resemble the\r\nearthworm by any manner of means.\r\n\r\nThe liver fluke is a flat, almost leaf-like creature, it is not ringed\r\nlike the earthworm and, under the microscope, we can plainly see all\r\nits internal organs. The fluke lays its eggs, each one enclosed in a\r\nlittle capsule, in the liver of the sheep. They are carried to the\r\nintestines and finally set free along with the animal’s excrement.\r\nIf then the eggs are blown, or carried by some means to water they\r\nwill continue their development, on dry soil they cannot long survive.\r\nEach egg gives rise to a little organism which swims freely in the\r\nwater; it is shaded like a blunt-ended cone when extended and is\r\nroughly oval when contracted. Its body is covered with little whip-like\r\nstructures similar to those of the slipper animalculæ, and it is due\r\nto the lashing of these little whips that the creature moves through\r\nthe water. If we found one of these young flukes in some pond water\r\nwe might be forgiven for thinking it to be some near relative of the\r\nslipper animalcule. When our subject finds a living water snail it\r\nenters its breathing organs, becomes affixed to their walls and loses\r\nits covering of little whips. It becomes transformed into a shapeless\r\nmass which later develops into an elongated structure, quite unlike\r\nthe free swimming creature which took shelter within the snail. Next,\r\na migration is made to the liver of the snail where birth is given to,\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty, curious little heart-shaped organisms each with\r\na tail about twice as long as its body. These little creatures escape\r\nfrom the snail and swim freely in the water for a time. Eventually they\r\nmake their way to herbage growing by the waterside, affix themselves\r\nthereto and become surrounded with a hard coat capable of resisting the\r\neffects of hot sun or drying winds. Should this herbage be eaten by\r\ncattle, the apparently lifeless young fluke bestirs itself, loses its\r\ntail and wends its way to the liver of its host, then the story begins\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHaving examined the adult liver fluke under the microscope, we shall\r\nprobably wish to find both the free swimming young forms, and if we\r\nsearch carefully in ponds to which sheep have access we are likely to\r\nbe rewarded. It is obvious that the life of a parasite such as the\r\nliver fluke is, of necessity, precarious. It is only chance or luck,\r\nor whatever one’s favourite term may be, that brings the egg to water,\r\nthe young fluke to a snail, and the last free swimming form to herbage\r\nthat will be eaten by a suitable animal. As usual in such cases, nature\r\nmakes provision for emergencies by providing a large number of young,\r\nin order to insure that some at least may be able to complete their\r\ndevelopment. Owing to a series of changes, which we have omitted to\r\ndescribe for the sake of simplicity, each liver fluke egg may give rise\r\nto no less than three hundred and twenty of the final free swimming\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nAs we have remarked, the study of parasites is difficult but it is\r\ninteresting. Very few of these creatures can complete their lives\r\nwithout living at the expense of two different animals. The liver fluke\r\nneeds the water snail and some herb-feeding animal; there is another\r\nparasite which spends part of its life in the pig and another part in\r\nthe grub of the cockchafer; a third parasite dwells for a time within\r\nthe thrush, and for the rest of its time within the garden snail, and\r\nso on. Apart from the interest of the subject in itself, it brings us\r\nface to face with the fact that many quite unrelated forms of animal\r\nlife are essential to the well being of a number of parasites. To the\r\nfarmer the subject is all important.\r\n\r\nInsects of various kinds are all important in agriculture; most of\r\nthem are harmful, some few are useful. They have, however, been dealt\r\nwith in another chapter, so we will dismiss them here. The ticks are\r\nclosely related, and anyone with access to a farm should be able to\r\nobtain some specimens. Whatever species we are able to obtain should\r\nbe examined under the microscope. Their feet are always interesting,\r\nbeing furnished with powerful claws beautifully adapted to grasping the\r\nhairy coats of their hosts. Their mouth parts are quite unlike those of\r\ninsects, and are always furnished with a number of backwardly directed\r\nteeth, which are useful for tearing flesh sufficiently to draw blood on\r\nwhich they feed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE MICROSCOPE AND INSECT LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of our readers will probably remark that entomology, or the\r\nnatural history of insects, is really a branch of zoology and should\r\nbe treated as such. We cannot pretend that they are wrong, but it is\r\nsuch a specialized branch that it merits separate treatment. Not many\r\nyears ago insects, with few exceptions, were looked upon as harmless\r\nand often beautiful dwellers upon the earth. They afforded endless\r\namusement to certain enthusiasts who collected them for their colouring\r\nor their odd forms. Recent developments of our scientific knowledge\r\nhave shown us that the insect is, other human beings excepted, man’s\r\nmost serious rival for the mastery of the world.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs has been beautifully depicted by an American\r\nnaturalist; his words described a by no means unlikely final scene on\r\nthis earth of ours. He wrote: “When the moon shall have faded from the\r\nsky and the sun shall shine at noonday, a dull cherry red, and the seas\r\nshall be frozen over, and the ice-cap shall have crept downward to the\r\nEquator from either pole, and no keel shall cut the waters, nor wheels\r\nturn in mills, when all cities shall have long been dead and crumbled\r\ninto dust and all life shall be on the very last verge of extinction on\r\nthis globe, then, on a bit of lichen, growing on the bald rocks beside\r\nthe eternal snows of Panama, shall be seated a tiny insect, preening\r\nits antennæ in the glow of the worn-out sun, representing the sole\r\nsurvival of animal life on this our earth--a melancholy ‘bug.’”\r\n\r\nThere is probably no field more interesting for the microscopist than\r\nthat provided by the insect world. Unlimited explorations may be made\r\nwith the certainty of finding something new at every turn. Most people\r\nbegin their studies of insect life with butterflies and moths; some\r\nfolk to their loss never proceed further. We may well follow the usual\r\ncourse, and make a butterfly our first study.\r\n\r\nAny butterfly or moth will do for our purpose, any one with coloured\r\nwings, for some have clear wings like those of the bees and wasps, but\r\nthey are not very common, so that we shall probably find a suitable\r\nspecimen at the first attempt. The more highly coloured the specimen,\r\nthe more attractive it will appear under the microscope. After killing\r\nthe insect, and not before, we may proceed to study it. Killing may\r\nbest be accomplished by means of a killing bottle, failing this a hard\r\nnip on the body, between thumb and finger, will do, but it must be no\r\nhalf-hearted proceeding or the insect will be injured without being\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nHaving removed a wing and placed it on the stage of our microscope, we\r\nmust examine it by reflected light, for it is not transparent. This\r\nmay be accomplished, if we are using artificial light, by raising the\r\nsource of illumination well above the object, so that the light strikes\r\nit at an angle of about forty-five degrees; by daylight reflected light\r\nis easily managed. If we have never previously examined a similar\r\nobject we will be surprised at its appearance. All the beautiful reds\r\nand blues, yellows and greens which comprise the brilliant livery of\r\nthese insects are seen, under the microscope, as hundreds of minute\r\nscales which overlap one another like tiles on a roof. A higher\r\nmagnification will show that each scale is roughly flask-shaped, and\r\nthat its narrow end fits into a little socket in the wing proper. When\r\nthe scales are rubbed from the wing, nothing remains but a transparent\r\nsubstance traversed by veins--to the microscopist the scaleless wing\r\nis of little interest; to the entomologist it is important, for the\r\nmoths, at anyrate, are arranged into families largely according to the\r\narrangement of the veins of their wings.\r\n\r\nMany other wings may be examined with advantage; gnats, for example,\r\nare clothed with scales of varied shape, some hair-like, some forked,\r\nsome resembling a sickle, and some disc-shaped; these forms, by the\r\nway, do not all occur upon the wings, but are found upon the head\r\nand other parts of the body as well. The wonderful gauzy, iridescent\r\nwings of dragon flies are interesting; those of various flies worth\r\nexamination also those of bees on account of the clever device for\r\nuniting the front and hind wings during flight. On the front edge of\r\nthe hind wings the microscope will show us a row of minute hooks. When\r\nthe bee makes a flight, it hooks its hind wings to a ridge on the\r\nhinder edge of the fore wings, so that for flying purposes it has, to\r\nall intents, two wings instead of four.\r\n\r\nHaving examined all the wings we can find for the time being, we may\r\nturn our attention to mouths. The mouth parts of insects are not\r\nonly interesting but important; one of the first things an economic\r\nentomologist does with a new specimen is to examine its mouth parts.\r\nThe mouth will tell us what manner of feeder its owner may be. Some\r\ninsects have sucking mouths, and they must feed perforce on liquids;\r\nothers have biting mouths, and they are likely to do damage to crops\r\nby eating them. Then there are lancet-like mouths and mouths which are\r\na compromise between biting and sucking ones. The subject, however,\r\nis somewhat complicated, and entails a knowledge of insect anatomy,\r\nso we will merely deal with a few easily understood examples. Our\r\nbutterfly has a sucking mouth; it is known as a proboscis, and may be\r\nfound, coiled like a watch spring, beneath its head. There is no trace\r\nof anything in this mouth capable of biting or even piercing the most\r\ndelicate structure. The house-fly is also possessed of a proboscis\r\nthough of different design. Though a dangerous, disease-carrying\r\ninsect, it can do no harm with its mouth. The partiality of the\r\nhouse-fly for sugar is well known, and it is interesting to learn\r\nhow, with its soft fleshy mouth, it can satisfy its cravings. Let\r\nus watch one at work on a lump of sugar through our pocket lens. If\r\nwe look carefully we shall notice that the fly, as he thrusts his\r\nproboscis here and there, emits from it a little drop of liquid; after\r\na momentary pause the liquid is sucked up again, it has dissolved a\r\nlittle of the sugar, and the fly enjoys the sugar-laden liquid.\r\n\r\nPeople frequently state that they have been bitten by a house-fly--a\r\nsheer impossibility. What really happens is that they mistake the\r\nvery similar stable fly for the house-fly. If one of these insects be\r\ncaptured and examined, we shall find not the soft fleshy proboscis\r\nof the house-fly, but a cruel looking, awl-like mouth easily able to\r\npenetrate the human skin. Certain tropical flies, known as Pangonias,\r\nhave such formidable and lengthy piercing mouths that they can\r\npenetrate thick clothing and puncture the skin below.\r\n\r\nMicroscopists who care to follow up the study of insects’ mouths will\r\nknow that they are accumulating really useful knowledge. Those who do\r\nnot desire to go so deeply into the matter may well spare a few moments\r\nfor the examination of the green fly mouth, a needle-like piercing\r\norgan which is thrust into plants for the purpose of sucking their sap.\r\nThe mouth of the gnat is a more difficult subject for the microscopist,\r\nthough no less interesting; it may be compared with the same organ of\r\nthe green fly, for it is used somewhat similarly, with the difference\r\nthat it sucks blood and not plant juices. It may be well to mention\r\nhere that the females alone suck blood, but it is easy to distinguish\r\nthe sexes, for the antennæ or feelers of the females are thread-like\r\nwhilst those of the males are feathered. A few adult insects have no\r\nmouths, for they never feed during their short lives.\r\n\r\nCaterpillars of all kinds and also beetles, grasshoppers, cockroaches\r\nand the like have biting-mouth parts, and the student, who is not well\r\nversed in insect anatomy, will learn more by watching one of these\r\ninsects partaking of a meal than by trying to discover the uses of the\r\nvarious parts with the aid of a microscope. Caterpillars as a rule are\r\nnot shy feeders, and a pocket lens will show their sickle-like jaws\r\nin full play. The grubs of house-flies are worth examining; they are\r\nsoft and fleshy except for a pair of horny hooks which are used to tear\r\nup the food material. There are, however, so many different mouths we\r\ncannot describe even the typical ones, but the microscopist will soon\r\ndiscover those of special interest.\r\n\r\nThe feet of insects do not show so much variation as their mouths,\r\nnevertheless they will afford ample material for many hours of study.\r\nOur butterfly, which is now but a remnant, will provide our first\r\nobject. The design of its feet will depend, to some extent, on the\r\nspecies of insect, but they will certainly be clawed. Other insects\r\nwith clawed feet--beetles, bees, and wasps--may be examined, and we\r\nshall see that there are minor differences amongst them though their\r\ngeneral plan is similar. Sometimes we find a simple pair of claws on\r\neach foot, in other cases each claw has a little spur, whilst spiders,\r\nwhich, by the way, are not insects, have comb-like claws. The foot of\r\nthe house-fly is not only provided with a pair of claws, but also with\r\na soft fleshy pad, by means of which it is enabled to climb window\r\npanes and similar smooth surfaces. If we are fortunate enough to obtain\r\na specimen of a louse, human or otherwise, we must not fail to notice\r\nits strong grasping claw, used for taking a firm hold of the hair of\r\nthe creature on which it lives. Such objects are better examined under\r\na high magnification, along with a hair, then the actual method of\r\ngrasping may be observed.\r\n\r\nThe feelers of some insects are interesting; those of gnats we\r\nhave already mentioned, but they may be examined in detail. Those\r\nof beetles are of very diverse form; some are thread-like, some\r\nclubbed, some fan-shaped. Moths, too, have many curious designs to\r\nshow. Some of these feelers, when highly magnified, may be seen to\r\nbe pitted--hundreds of little sunken areas are scattered over their\r\nsurfaces, and it is probable that they are connected with a sense of\r\nsmell. In that case the feeler is a more important organ than one might\r\nsurmise from its popular name.\r\n\r\nThe hairy clothing of insects need not delay us long. Most interesting\r\nof all are the feathered hairs of certain bees. In our chapter on\r\nbotanical work with the microscope we mentioned the feathery stigmas\r\nof grass flowers and we also stated that they took that form, so that\r\npollen grains blown to them would be entangled in their branches. The\r\nhairs of many bees are feathered for a similar reason, they gather\r\npollen and the pollen adheres to these “feathers” much more readily and\r\nin much greater quantity, than it would to simple, unbranched hairs.\r\nSome bees collect no pollen and, from them, feathered hairs are wanting.\r\n\r\nAny microscopist who has followed us thus far, will have a fair idea of\r\nthe structure of a number of insects. In every case, where possible,\r\ncomparisons should be made between similar organs of different insects\r\nand the investigations may be made more interesting by observing\r\nthe habits of the insects and trying to discover reasons for the\r\ndifferences in structure. It is safe to surmise that there is a reason\r\nin every case. There are many other interesting subjects which we have\r\nnot mentioned, the legs of insects--running legs of ground beetles,\r\ndigging legs of mole crickets, swimming legs of water beetles and the\r\nwonderful pollen-carrying legs of bees. Then again, the eggs of many\r\ninsects are of surpassing beauty in shape, they may be round, oval,\r\noblong, nearly square and almost needle shaped; some are smooth and\r\nshining like burnished metal, others beautifully sculptured; some\r\nresemble miniature birds’ eggs, others are not unlike the seeds of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nMany insects are too small to be cut up into their various parts,\r\nlegs, feet, wings, etc., by unskilled hands and they must be examined\r\nwhole. Perhaps you may think that an insect will be too big an object\r\nfor your microscope. Indeed there are some insects which measure nearly\r\na foot in length, but there are, on the other hand, beetles no longer\r\nthan one hundredth part of an inch. When we examined the house-fly\r\nit is not unlikely that we found some minute creatures living upon\r\nit. None of these is likely to be an insect, but as they are closely\r\nrelated we may mention them here. Beneath the wings of the house fly\r\nthere are often minute, red, six legged young mites, all eagerly\r\nsucking the juices of their host. Because they are six legged we may\r\nbe led to think that they are insects, for the entomologist knows that\r\nthe true insect, in its adult form, never has more than six legs. These\r\nmites, however, later in life, drop from the fly and by developing\r\nanother pair of legs appear in their true colours. Various other\r\nmites, including cheesemites, may be found clinging to the house-fly,\r\nin fact it is by the aid of these insects that cheesemites are often\r\ncarried from cheese to cheese. One of the most curious parasites of the\r\nhouse-fly must be sought upon its legs. If the search is successful,\r\ncurious, reddish-brown creatures, armed with formidable pincers, and\r\nstrangely reminiscent of miniature lobsters, will be found clinging\r\nthereto. They are called chelifers and their home is the manure heap,\r\nso that their presence shows us only too well where our friend the fly\r\nhas recently disported himself. His next visit was probably to our\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1. THE HEAD OF A BEETLE\r\n\r\n    A remarkable beetle, with enormously developed fore-legs.

THE HEAD OF MANTIS\r\n\r\n    This illustration clearly shows the cruel rat-trap-like front legs\r\n    of the rapacious mantis.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf we can find a swiftly running stream within easy reach a little\r\ntime may be spent in searching the submerged rocks and plants for the\r\nminiature stages of the buffalo gnat. This insect, which is known\r\nto scientists as _Simulium_, has a most interesting life history.\r\nIts popular name is derived from its hump-backed appearance and its\r\nsupposed resemblance to a buffalo. The female lays her eggs on a rock\r\nor reed, just covered by running water, she never lays them in still\r\nwater. The greenish-brown, club-shaped grubs which come from the eggs\r\nare curious and they will repay examination under a low magnification.\r\nAt the more blunt end of the creature there is a large sucker; it uses\r\nthis as a foot to support itself in an upright position. If we examine\r\nour specimen under water we shall see that its horny head is decorated\r\nwith a pair of fans, each one composed of about fifty threads. These\r\nfans open and close with a rhythmic movement and, in doing so, attract\r\nsmall floating water plants to the mouth. Just below the head there\r\nis a single leg with a sucker foot. When the grub walks, it does so\r\nby a looping movement, holding fast to its support with fore and hind\r\nsuckers alternately.\r\n\r\nThe next stage in the life of the young buffalo gnat is even more\r\ncurious. On the surface of some submerged leaf we shall probably be\r\nable to find a number of the slipper-shaped pockets made of closely\r\nwoven silk, in which the insect spends the final portion of its life\r\nbefore turning into the perfect fly. Within some of the pockets we\r\nshall find the creature itself and it must be studied. Its head is\r\nstill ornamented with a pair of fans, but in this case they are gills\r\nby means of which the insect breathes and not food scoops, for it has\r\nreached a stage when food is not taken. On its tail end there is a\r\nhook, by means of which it anchors itself to its slipper-shaped pocket.\r\nProbably we shall find bubbles of air collecting round some of the\r\ninsects, within their pockets; as the time approaches nearer and nearer\r\nfor the change to the perfect insect to take place the bubbles grow\r\nlarger and larger. Eventually the fly emerges within a bubble, shakes\r\nit free from the pocket and floats to the surface of the water without\r\nwetting its wings.\r\n\r\nThe pond will supply insects quite as interesting as the running\r\nstream. Here we may find the eggs of Caddis flies, enclosed in\r\njelly-like envelopes, rope-like, horse-shoe shaped or simple masses.\r\nThe caterpillar cases of these insects should be slightly magnified\r\nand examined, for they are marvellously constructed of shells or sand,\r\npieces of stick, leaves or other vegetation.\r\n\r\nWe may come across the young stages of the common gnat. Its eggs are\r\nvery small and when the mother gnat lays them on the surface of ponds\r\nshe glues them together so that they form what is known as an “egg\r\nraft.” The “raft” we shall notice, if we examine it carefully, is\r\ncomposed of a large number of eggs; each egg is elongated, pointed\r\nat one end and blunt at the other. Every egg is arranged with its\r\nblunt end downwards for, from that end, the larvæ gnats make their way\r\ninto the water. A larva, it may be explained, is the stage in insect\r\ndevelopment which follows the egg; the next stage is known as the\r\npupa. When the eggs are first laid they are white but, before they\r\nhatch, they become darker and darker, till they are almost black. The\r\nlarvæ which hatch from the eggs we must examine under our microscope\r\nand also in the water--they may easily be kept in a small jar of pond\r\nwater. If we study their habits carefully, we shall observe that they\r\nfloat almost at right angles to the surface of the water and that,\r\nwhile doing so, the tip of a little peg-like outgrowth on the tail\r\nend of their bodies is thrust out of the water. The little peg is the\r\nbreathing organ of the gnat larva and the flaps which open and close\r\nat its tip are worth examination. In a few days, the denizens of our\r\npond water will change their appearance and become comma shaped. On\r\ntheir heads we shall see a pair of curious horns, which project out of\r\nthe water as the creatures, which have now become pupæ, float at the\r\nsurface. The horns are breathing organs. As we examine these pupæ, day\r\nby day, we shall see the various parts of the complete gnat as they\r\ndevelop within the body of the comma. Finally, under the microscope,\r\nwe can trace all the parts of the gnat. Darker and darker the little\r\ncreatures become, as development proceeds; at the same time they become\r\nless active and less comma shaped. At length the time comes when they\r\nstraighten their tails somewhat violently, their skin splits along\r\nthe back and out comes the perfect gnat. We can use him for further\r\nmicroscopic work, so we will not let him go. If he be a male, his\r\nbeautiful feathered feelers or, if a female, her thread-like feelers\r\nwill make good objects for us, the scales from head and body, the wings\r\nand feet are all worth the time we may spend in examining them. The\r\nmouth parts, too, are interesting but rather complicated.\r\n\r\nMany insects are capable of emitting more or less musical sounds. In\r\nsome countries these so-called singing insects are kept as pets, in\r\nother countries the same insects are voted a nuisance; it is all a\r\nmatter of taste. Of all musical insects, the most noted is the Cicada\r\nand its sound organs are easily seen; they occur only in the male, for\r\nthe female never sings. The Cicada belongs to the same great order of\r\ninsects as the green fly, which we have already mentioned. There is one\r\nBritish species, and our readers who visit the New Forest may come upon\r\nit. On the under side of one of these insects the beak, very similar to\r\nthe beak of the green fly, may be plainly seen. On either side of the\r\ninsect, just below the bases of the wings there are two nearly round\r\ndiscs. These discs cover the sound organs, which are two ear shaped\r\nmembranes. By means of muscles the insect can cause the membranes to\r\nvibrate and thus produce the sound which once heard, can never be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nMore easily found insects, in this country, at any rate, are the\r\ncricket and the grasshopper. The cricket we all know is a persistent\r\nsongster. Let us examine him closely. We shall find, that the house\r\ncricket has two pairs of wings; the fore wings are leathery, the hind\r\nwings membranous. If we watch a male in the act of chirping, the male\r\ncrickets like the male Cicadas are the songsters, we shall observe\r\nthat he moves his wings slightly. If now we examine a dead male, we\r\nshall find, on the under surface of the forewing, a rough patch. Let us\r\nexamine this patch under the microscope, it reminds us of nothing so\r\nmuch as a file: it is a file in fact, and sound is produced by rubbing\r\nthis rough file against a ridge, which we can easily see, on the upper\r\nsurface of the hind wing.\r\n\r\nIt would be a useless accomplishment for the cricket to be able to\r\nsing, if there were no ears to hear its song. Nature has arranged that\r\nhis song shall not go unheard and if we examine a female cricket, that\r\nis to say a cricket which has no sound-producing apparatus, we shall\r\nfind an oval depression, covered by a membrane, on each of her front\r\nlegs; these are her ears and they enable her to hear her mate calling\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nWe have often heard the song of the grasshopper as we have walked\r\nthrough the fields and he too will occupy our time for a few moments.\r\nWhen he sings, he kicks his legs rather violently and this gives us a\r\nclue to the situation of his vocal organs. The inside of each of his\r\nhind thighs is ridged and the edge of each ridge is, as we can see\r\nif we magnify it, rough like a file. This file-like ridge is rubbed\r\nagainst a smooth ridge on the edge of the fore wing and the result is\r\nthe familiar note of the grasshopper.\r\n\r\nThis insect also has ears, but they are not easy to find unless they\r\nare pointed out to us. If we examine a grasshopper we shall see that\r\nits body is divided into three parts: a head, a solid portion from\r\nwhich the wings and legs arise, the thorax and a portion (the abdomen)\r\nmade up of a number of rings or segments. On the sides of the first\r\nof these rings, counting from the forward end, we shall find small\r\ndepressions covered with membrane, these are the ears. It is curious\r\nthat although many of the grasshoppers cannot give out a note, so far\r\nas human ears can detect, they nearly all have ears; maybe there is a\r\ngrasshopper song which only grasshoppers can hear.\r\n\r\nVery many other insects have sound organs, but they are nearly all\r\nconstructed on the same plan. It may seem surprising that sounds can be\r\nproduced by these simple means. Sound is really caused by waves in the\r\nair and these insect vocal organs set up rapid sound waves, by their\r\nvibration.\r\n\r\nThe microscopist should never be at a loss for objects derived from the\r\ninsect world: it is impossible to walk without treading upon some six\r\nlegged wayfarer. The wing cases of beetles are often of rare beauty,\r\nsome on account of their sculpturing, some because of a mantle of\r\nscales.\r\n\r\nIn our greenhouse and garden we can find mealy bugs, curious little\r\npowdered insects which do an enormous amount of damage. The fringe\r\nwings, or Thrips, are common and destructive; examine their curious\r\nfeet and their beautifully fringed wings, the sight will repay you. And\r\nlastly, if you number an insect enthusiast amongst your friends, enlist\r\nhis aid in gathering objects for your microscope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE MICROSCOPE BY THE SEASIDE--ANIMAL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is always surprising that the majority of microscopists never dream\r\nof examining any of the hundreds of beautiful objects which can be\r\nfound by the seaside, in the course of an afternoon’s ramble. That\r\nevery pond will contain ample material for study, the microscopist\r\nknows instinctively; insect life and plant life also he studies, but\r\nthe microscope is generally left at home when a visit is paid to the\r\nseaside. A rocky coast is better than a sandy one, for rock pools yield\r\nmany objects, and the warmer southern waters of our coasts are better\r\nthan the colder northern seas, but the microscopist who finds himself\r\non a northern sandy coast need not despair, if he search diligently he\r\nwill find material enough to occupy him for many a day.\r\n\r\nNearly every rock pool will provide one or more Sea Anemones; it is\r\nhardly necessary to describe these “flowers of the sea” as they have\r\nbeen called, they are such familiar objects and the brilliant colouring\r\nof some of them makes them highly attractive. In many respects Sea\r\nAnemones resemble the _Hydra_, one of the pond dwellers, they are\r\nrather more highly developed, however. Any Sea Anemone will serve our\r\npurpose because we are about to examine the little darts with which its\r\ntentacles, and even its body, are armed. If we find several different\r\nkinds of Anemone, we must take the most transparent we can find and\r\nalso a small specimen; we can examine the larger, more opaque ones\r\nlater. Having transferred our specimen to a small jar, containing but\r\na small quantity of sea water, we wait till it has recovered from its\r\ntransfer and spread its tentacles, then it must be killed by one of the\r\nmethods suggested in our concluding chapter (see p. 306). One of the\r\ntentacles must then be snipped off with scissors--some people cut off\r\nthe tentacle without killing the Anemone and the animal does not appear\r\nto suffer a great amount of inconvenience, in fact a new tentacle soon\r\ngrows to take the place of the old one. We do not recommend promiscuous\r\nvivisection. The tentacle is placed on a clean slide, a cover slip\r\nplaced over it and pressure is applied. An enormous number of little\r\nthread-like darts are pressed from all parts of the tentacle. In some\r\ncases, little oval capsules are squeezed out and, in the capsules,\r\nthe darts may be plainly seen, coiled up. On applying pressure to a\r\ncapsule, the contained dart will shoot forth, much as does a glove\r\nfinger turned inside out, when we blow violently into the glove. These\r\nlittle darts are of the greatest interest to the microscopist; they\r\nvary in shape according to the kind of Anemone, as we shall find if we\r\ntry this experiment with various Anemones. Some of them are straight\r\nwith stiff bristles at their bases; some have backwardly directed barbs\r\nat their tips; others are apparently jointed, forming a zigzag, with\r\na short length of the dart going from left to right, the next short\r\nlength from right to left, and so on to the tip. It is marvellous how\r\nthe darts can be accommodated within the capsule, for the average\r\nlength of the latter is but 1/300 inch whereas its dart may measure 1/8\r\ninch. These little threads contain a poison capable of paralyzing any\r\nmoderate-sized fishes which they touch.\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen a “comb bearer” or as it is often called, a “marble\r\nbleb?” Probably you have though you may not know its name. Sometimes it\r\noccurs in rock pools, though more often it is found in one’s shrimping\r\nnet and occasionally it is washed up by the tide, but it does not live\r\nlong out of water. The “marble bleb,” as its name denotes, is an almost\r\nglobular mass of soft, transparent jelly. It is practically colourless,\r\nwith the exception of eight bright coloured bands which run from end to\r\nend of the animal. To the naked eye, this little denizen of the sea is\r\nof rare beauty: as an object for low-power microscopy it is entrancing.\r\n\r\nWhen magnified, the bright bands are seen to be composed of rows of\r\nflattened outgrowths. If our specimen is small enough to be examined\r\nin water, its real beauty can only be seen in this manner, we shall\r\nobserve that the flattened outgrowths act like paddles, sometimes they\r\nwork all together, sometimes independently of one another and this fact\r\nexplains the marvellous evolutions of the “marble bleb” in water. Now\r\nit shoots forward in a straight line with some rapidity, now it rolls\r\nover and over and swims onward while doing so.\r\n\r\nIn the sun, it displays glorious iridescent colouring. At the hinder\r\nend of the “bleb” we notice a pair of hollows: from these, as we watch\r\nit swim, we shall see it suddenly shoot out a pair of long feathery\r\ntendrils and they may be withdrawn into the hollows as suddenly. We\r\nmust make a point of examining the “marble bleb,” it is one of the gems\r\nof our coasts.\r\n\r\nSuperficially the common, sponge-like “Dead man’s toes” or, to give it\r\nits more pleasant title, “Mermaid’s fingers,” is a very drab affair. It\r\nis a dirty-brown lobed, spongy mass with a leathery skin; when removed\r\nfrom the water it loses all semblance of shape. In sea water, however,\r\nif we examine it carefully, we shall see that it is studded with\r\nbeautiful little flower-like creatures, each one resembling a miniature\r\nSea Anemone. Examined, in water, under a low power of our microscope\r\nwe can see the water current flowing through the channels with which\r\nit is perforated, after the manner of a sponge. If, now, we take a\r\ndead specimen and cut it up, placing a small portion on a slide and\r\nshredding it with a pair of needles, we shall find, when we magnify\r\nthe result of our work, that there are a number of minute mineral\r\nspikes, called spicules, and very beautiful objects they make for the\r\nmicroscope. There are many sea-side creatures, which we may find,\r\nclosely related to “Mermaid’s fingers,” they may all be treated in the\r\nsame way for they will all yield spicules which will repay us for our\r\ntrouble. All these spongy organisms are not provided with spicules as\r\nornaments, though one might be forgiven for thinking so, seeing how\r\ndecorative many of them are. Their presence is necessary to strengthen\r\nthe spongy material.\r\n\r\nThe specimen we have just examined is not one animal but a colony of\r\nvery minute animals. These colonies are very common, not only in salt\r\nbut also in fresh water. They serve a useful purpose, for the creatures\r\ncomposing them are so minute that they would fare badly did they\r\ndwell alone. Dwelling together as they do and each one contributing\r\nits share to the building of the home they appear to thrive to a\r\nwonderful degree. The coral islands are built, as to their foundations\r\nat anyrate, by millions of very minute animals, living together in\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nWe mentioned the sponges a moment ago and many of them may be found\r\naround our coasts; not the household sponges we know so well, but\r\nmuch smaller, though equally interesting, colonies. Like the better\r\nknown sponges, those which we find on our shores are perforated with a\r\nnumber of holes through which the water is driven by means of little\r\nwhip-like structures which line the cavities. Professor Grant has\r\ngraphically described his impressions at witnessing this water current\r\nfor the first time. “I put a small branch of the _Spongia Coalita_,” he\r\nwrites, “with some sea water in a watch glass, under the microscope,\r\nand, on reflecting the light of a candle up through the fluid, I soon\r\nperceived that there was some internal motion in the opaque particles\r\nfloating through the water. On moving the watch glass, so as to bring\r\none of the apertures on the side of the sponge fully into view, I\r\nbeheld, for the first time, the splendid spectacle of this living\r\nfountain vomiting forth from a circular cavity an impetuous torrent\r\nof liquid matter, and hurling along, in rapid succession, opaque\r\nmasses, which it strewed everywhere around. The beauty and novelty of\r\nsuch a scene in the Animal Kingdom long arrested my attention; but\r\nafter twenty-five minutes of constant observation, I was obliged to\r\nwithdraw my eye from fatigue, without having seen the torrent for one\r\ninstant change its direction, or diminish, in the slightest degree, the\r\nrapidity of its course. I continued to watch the same orifice, at short\r\nintervals, for five hours, sometimes observing it for a quarter of an\r\nhour at a time, but still the stream rolled on with a constant and even\r\nvelocity. About the end of this time, however, I observed the current\r\nto become perceptibly languid ... and in one hour more the current had\r\nentirely ceased.”\r\n\r\nFrequently the sponge we examine may be found to be studded with many\r\nyellowish spots; closer examination will show that these spots are\r\ncomposed of very small jelly covered eggs. Later these eggs find their\r\nway into the cavities of the sponge and are forced therefrom in the\r\ncurrents of water. Each of the young sponges thus expelled is furnished\r\nwith a covering of little whips, by means of which it swims about till\r\nit can find a suitable spot on which to anchor and complete its growth.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Anemone, which has already provided us with objects for our\r\nmicroscope, has many near relatives which we must make a point of\r\nexamining, while we have the opportunity. Many of these creatures, or\r\nrather their colonies, for they do not live singly, are to the naked\r\neye, strangely like seaweeds. A number of them are moss-like and may\r\nbe found on wooden breakwaters and similar situations when the tide is\r\nlow; they should be collected and examined and, to see them at their\r\nbest they should be examined under water. It is hardly necessary to\r\ndescribe any one of these colonies in detail, for they are so numerous\r\nthat the one we described might not come into the hands of our readers\r\nfor a long time. In general characters they are all somewhat similar\r\nso we will confine ourselves to generalities. For the most part, the\r\nstems and branches of these colonies are of the thickness of thread. As\r\nwe watch them under the microscope we shall see that they are studded\r\nwith little cups and, presently, from each little cup there appears a\r\nlittle tuft of tentacles which is waved about in the water. Each member\r\nof the colony is similar to its neighbour and each one, again, is very\r\nlike the fresh water _Hydra_ with which we are familiar.\r\n\r\nOf all the common objects of the sea shore one of the commonest\r\neverywhere is the sea-mat. Nine people out of ten or, we might safely\r\nsay that everyone who had not learned its true nature, would guess it\r\nto be a seaweed. As we find it washed up on the beach it is almost the\r\ncolour of sand, somewhat rough to the touch, whilst its whole surface\r\nis pitted with minute holes. The sea-mat, when dry as we usually find\r\nit, is a remnant of a colony of sea dwellers very similar to those\r\nwe have just described. From each little hole, in a living specimen,\r\nwhich we can find without much difficulty, there appear the familiar\r\ntentacles; each hole is the home of a minute hydra-like animal.\r\n\r\nHooke, whom we mentioned in our chapter on the History of the\r\nMicroscope, though a careful observer, was quite misled by the sea-mat;\r\nhe thought it was a seaweed, for he wrote: “I have not, among all\r\nplants and vegetables I have yet observed, seen any one comparable to\r\nthis seaweed. It is a plant which grows upon the rocks under water\r\nand increases and spreads itself into a great tuft, which is not only\r\nhandsomely branched into several leaves, but the whole surface is\r\ncovered over with a most curious knot of carved work, which consists of\r\na texture much resembling a honeycomb, for the whole surface on both\r\nsides is covered over with a multitude of very small holes, being no\r\nlarger than so many holes made with a pin, and ranged in the neatest\r\nand most delicate order imaginable, they being placed in the manner of\r\na quincunx, or very much like the rows of eyes of a fly, the rows or\r\norders being very regular which way soever they are observed. These\r\nlittle holes, which to the eye look round, when magnified, appear very\r\nregularly shaped holes, representing almost the shape of a round-toed\r\nshoe, the hinder part of each being, as it were, turned in, or covered\r\nby the toe of the next below it. These holes seemed walled about with\r\nvery thin and transparent substance, looking of a pale straw colour,\r\nfrom the edge of which, against the middle of each hole, were sprouted\r\nout four small, transparent, straw-coloured thorns, which seemed to\r\nprotect and cover those cavities.”\r\n\r\nAs a well-known author has remarked: “This is really a wonderfully\r\nfaithful description of the common sea-mat, and one cannot help\r\npicturing the surprise and delight of old author Hooke, could he have\r\nseen a portion of a living colony under a modern microscope.”\r\n\r\nOne of our finds may be the “Bird’s head.” It is a branched form,\r\nquite unlike the sea-mat but it is of even greater interest. Under the\r\nmicroscope, we shall see the many waving tentacles, but another feature\r\nis sure to attract our attention, a feature which is responsible for\r\nthe popular name of the colony. On the outside of each cavity\r\ncontaining a member of the colony there is a structure which resembles\r\nnothing so much as a hawk-like bird’s head atop of a long neck. While\r\nthe tentacles wave in the water, the bird’s head snaps vigorously,\r\nmoved here and moved there. The birds’ heads, which might be mistaken\r\nfor parasites stealing food from the waving tentacles, really perform\r\nthe useful function of keeping them clean and warding off creatures\r\nwhich might do them harm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _By the courtesy of Messrs. F. Davidson & Co._\r\n\r\n  1. A SECTION OF HUMAN SKIN\r\n\r\n    The corkscrew-like pores, leading from the sweat glands to the\r\n    surface, are plainly seen in the section.\r\n\r\n  2.

There are very many kinds but the common star\r\nfish will serve our purpose well. We may make a beginning by examining\r\nhis back under a low magnification and observing that it is protected\r\nby a number of hard plates which form a very efficient armour. At the\r\npoint where two of the rays (the finger like structures) arise we shall\r\nnotice a small flat plate, this too is worth a moment’s inspection, for\r\nit is the water pore through which the star fish takes in water.\r\n\r\nThe under surface of the star fish shows us of course its mouth in\r\nthe centre of its body, the soft fleshy suckers which cover the rays,\r\nwith the exception of a narrow line down the centre of each one. At\r\nthe tip of each ray there is an eye; it may easily be distinguished by\r\nits bright red colour and microscopic examination will show us that it\r\nis quite unlike any of the other eyes we have examined. Over each eye\r\nthere is a little tentacle; these little tentacles may be called the\r\nnoses of the star fish, for, by means of them it is able to smell. They\r\nare as unlike our idea of a nose as are the little pits on the feeler\r\nof the cockchafer which we examined, yet these noses and ours all\r\nperform the same duties. Our time will be well spent if we devote some\r\nof it to a search for others less common star fish. Some of them are\r\nreally beautiful and whatever specimens we come across can be compared\r\nwith the common variety which is everywhere.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the star fish are the sea-urchins. The relationship\r\nmay not be apparent at first sight but a careful study of an urchin\r\nand a star will reveal many points of similarity. Our object in these\r\npages, however, is to find material for our microscope and not to\r\nunfold the relationships of various members of the Animal Kingdom. When\r\nwe have learned to cut sections, we may try our hand at the spine of\r\na sea-urchin, it is an object well worthy of study. The hard shell of\r\nthe urchin may be examined under a low magnification, we shall see then\r\nthat his armour is far more highly developed than that of the star fish.\r\n\r\nAnother near relative of the two animals we have just described is\r\nthe sea slug or sea cucumber. Though an article of commerce of some\r\nimportance in the far East, the sea slug is not so common on our coasts\r\nas its relations. We must make a point of finding a specimen, however,\r\nfor it provides us with one of the most remarkable objects for our\r\nmicroscope that could possibly be imagined. One species, which goes by\r\nthe name of _Synapta Inhærens_, is the one most worthy of examination.\r\nWe must describe the creature first of all so that we may know what\r\nto look for. It is aptly named sea cucumber for it is not unlike that\r\nfruit--yes! fruit is correct, though the cucumber is more often called\r\na vegetable. The animal’s skin is tough and leathery and at the head\r\nend there is a fringe of feathery tentacles. The sea cucumber must be\r\nlooked for amongst sea weeds or, maybe, he lies buried in the sand,\r\nwith only his fringe of tentacles on view. A friendly fisherman will\r\nprobably aid us in our search.\r\n\r\nHaving found our creature we must examine his leathery skin under the\r\nmicroscope. To the touch it is evident that it is studded with some\r\nflinty matter, but the microscope alone can show us the amazing beauty\r\nof this armour. Under a low magnification, we can see, dotted over the\r\nleathery skin, some nearly circular plates to each of which is attached\r\na little anchor. Now, from a dead animal of course, we must scrape away\r\nsome of these objects and examine them with a higher magnification.\r\nEven the hardened microscopist will be delighted when he sees the\r\narmour of the sea cucumber for the first time. Each anchor is hinged\r\nto a little plate, each little plate, nearly circular in outline, is\r\nperforated with seven holes, six round the circumference and one in the\r\ncentre and every perforation has a toothed margin. So perfect are these\r\nminute plates and anchors, that the most intricate man-made machinery\r\ncould not have turned them out more perfectly to pattern. They are\r\nprecisely similar to one another in size and shape; as objects for the\r\nmicroscope, even the sea with all its store of wonders, can offer us\r\nnothing more marvellous.\r\n\r\nWe may number the sea mouse amongst our treasures of the sea-side.\r\nThough called a mouse, on account of its curious movements and partly\r\nperhaps because of its appearance, it is really a worm. It does not\r\nappear to have the slightest resemblance to the common earth worm, nor\r\nto the liver fluke which is described on another page, nevertheless,\r\nit is related to both these creatures. The raiment of the sea mouse\r\nis gorgeous in the extreme; on its back is soft brownish hair, its\r\nsides are clothed with yellow and green hair, displaying a wonderful\r\niridescence and amongst the hair on the sides there are many stiff\r\nbrown bristles. Of the covering of the sea mouse it has been said:\r\n“It is as if all the hues of the rainbow were collected there, making\r\nthis remarkable animal a living jewel, and truly worthy of the name of\r\nAphrodite, the Queen of Beauty.” The bristles of this creature we must\r\nexamine microscopically, they vary in structure according to the kind\r\nof sea mouse, for there are several kinds, but in some of them they are\r\nformidably barbed, in all of them they act as a protection.\r\n\r\nMany other worms, a number of them un-wormlike in appearance will claim\r\nour attention but we cannot devote more space to them here. There is\r\nthe common shell-binder, a curious worm, which builds for itself a\r\nstill more curious shelter of broken shells. Another worm, _Serpula_\r\nby name, also lives in tube-like structures of its own manufacture and\r\nis remarkable in that a row of nearly two thousand seven-toothed hooks\r\nrun along its back and all these thirteen thousand odd teeth are there\r\nmerely for the purpose of holding _Serpula_ in its tubular home.\r\n\r\nMuch interesting work may be done at the seaside in studying the young\r\nstages of various familiar creatures. This work, however, necessitates\r\nthe keeping of the adults in an aquarium; for the young ones, in most\r\ncases, are so unlike their parents that, if found swimming about on\r\ntheir own account, they would never be recognised. Young barnacles,\r\nfor instance, have six legs, a tubular mouth and a single eye. At a\r\nlater stage they might be mistaken for young shell fish; they possess\r\na shell, not unlike that of the mussel, containing, however, not a\r\nsoft, fleshy mollusc but a six legged creature which swims through the\r\nwater in jerks, after the manner of a water flea. Strangely enough, it\r\nis now provided with two stalked eyes like those of a crab, whilst of\r\nmouth parts it has none, or they are so imperfectly developed as to\r\nbe useless for feeding. Soon this active youngster settles down for\r\nthe rest of its life and becomes a sedate and sedentary barnacle, with\r\none imperfectly developed eye and a mouth capable of feeding to good\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nYoung crabs are equally curious and also totally unlike their parents,\r\nbut these curious creatures are hardly accessible to those who only pay\r\na flying visit to the sea-side. As we have remarked, an aquarium is a\r\nnecessity and to keep marine animals inland is a feat beyond the powers\r\nof the ordinary mortal.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Lemon or Doris is a curious little creature, worthy of\r\nexamination. Its habit is to feed upon sponges and strange diet it\r\nis, for we remember that all sponges are fortified with hard flinty\r\nstructures, called spicules. This habit of the Sea Lemon is of use to\r\nthe microscopist, for the stomach of the creature is always laden with\r\nthe indigestible spicules and a very interesting collection of these\r\nbeautiful structures may be gathered together in this manner. The egg\r\nmasses of Doris may be looked for on rocks during the summer. Enormous\r\nnumbers of eggs are laid in a jelly-like mass. Some of this jelly may\r\nbe collected and examined under the microscope and, should we have\r\ncollected our material at a favourable moment, we may watch the eggs\r\nhatch and observe the young Sea Lemons in their delicate transparent\r\nshells swimming round and round the chamber within which they are\r\nimprisoned during the very early stages of their lives.\r\n\r\nVery frequently in the summer, when the seas are warm any agitation\r\nof the water causes a beautiful phosphorescence to appear.\r\nPhosphorescence, by the way, may be described as light without\r\nheat and it is not uncommon in nature. Glow worms and fireflies are\r\nphosphorescent; fish, also, in the dead state, often emit a certain\r\namount of light as do bones whilst, of course, phosphorous itself is\r\nthe best example of a naturally phosphorescent body. Phosphorescent\r\nsea water, however, owes its peculiarity to myriads of minute animals\r\nand they will afford us an interesting half hour with the microscope.\r\nLet us collect a little of this water in a glass jar and take it into\r\na darkened room that we may the better see the phosphorescence. When\r\nthe water in the jar is undisturbed, we can see nothing unusual; if\r\nwe stir it or strike it a faint greenish light is given off, but it\r\ndoes not last for long. Now, on taking the jar into the daylight, as\r\nsoon as our eyes are accustomed to the light, we shall just be able\r\nto see that there are some very small living creatures on the surface\r\nof the water. We must examine one, under a fairly high magnification;\r\nit may be transferred, from the jar to a drop of water on our slide,\r\nby means of a paint brush. The little animal which is responsible for\r\nthe phosphorescence of sea water is strangely reminiscent of an apple\r\nwith its stalk. It is, of course, very minute being only 1/60 inch\r\nin diameter and its tail, which we have compared to the stalk of the\r\napple, is equal to the diameter in length. The whole creature is quite\r\ntransparent. As we watch it swim in our drop of water, we shall notice\r\nthat it propels itself by the lashing of its tail.\r\n\r\nThere are countless animals of the sea we have not so much as\r\nmentioned, but the marine gardens contain plants so interesting and so\r\ntotally unlike those which live upon land that we must devote a few\r\npages to them also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE MICROSCOPE BY THE SEASIDE--PLANT LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plant life of the sea side may be divided into two natural groups\r\n(i) of plants living on the shore near the sea and (ii) of plants\r\nliving in the sea, for part of each day at least. The former group\r\ncontains many plants of exactly the same kind as occur far inland,\r\ntogether with a few typically sea-side plants such as Thrift or Sea\r\nPink. They are, however, one and all land plants. In this chapter we\r\nshall confine ourselves to the real sea plants, the seaweeds.\r\n\r\nBefore we study any of these interesting plants under the microscope,\r\nit will be useful to learn a little about seaweeds in general, because\r\nthey are so totally unlike land plants in every respect. They belong to\r\nthe great plant division known as the _Algæ_, to which also belong the\r\nDiatoms, Desmids, _Volvox_, _Spirogyra_ and many of the other plants\r\nwe mentioned in our chapter on Pond Life. So we see that, although all\r\nseaweeds are _Algæ_, not all _Algæ_ are seaweeds. They are higher in\r\nthe scale of development than Fungi, to which Bacteria, Yeast, Mould,\r\netc., belong, though they are not so highly developed as Ferns and not\r\nnearly so advanced as flowering plants. A very short acquaintance with\r\n_Algæ_ will show us that they are either green, brown or red. The green\r\n_Algæ_ are nearly all fresh water forms, though a few are to be found\r\nin the sea; on the other hand brown and red _Algæ_ are common in the\r\nsea and rare in fresh water.\r\n\r\nAs we study our seaweeds on the shore, if we are really observant,\r\nwe shall notice that they live in zones or belts according to their\r\ncolour. There are exceptions to this rule but, in general, the green\r\nseaweeds dwell in situations where they are only covered by the sea\r\nat high tide; the red seaweeds are to be found mostly where they are\r\nalways below water and, between the two, the brown seaweeds occur.\r\nIn some parts, this colour scheme is very striking. Frequently red\r\nseaweeds may be found above high-water mark it is true, but in such\r\ncases they nearly always occur in rock pools and they are invariably\r\nsheltered by brown seaweeds.\r\n\r\nIn our chapter on plant life we mentioned that many coloured plants\r\ncontained the green colouring matter, chlorophyll, just as do the\r\nordinary green leaves. We showed too that by boiling some green leaves\r\nin methylated spirits we could extract the chlorophyll and that its\r\nsolution had the peculiar property of appearing green when light passes\r\nthrough it and red when light is reflected from it. If now we take\r\nalmost any brown or red seaweed, we cannot see a trace of chlorophyll\r\nanywhere. Let us leave our specimen, however, in fresh water for a\r\nfew days when we shall find that the brown or red colouring matter as\r\nthe case may be, is dissolved by the water and a green plant remains.\r\nBy treating the seaweed, deprived of its distinctive colour, with\r\nmethylated spirit as described above, we can obtain a solution of\r\nchlorophyll.\r\n\r\nThe microscopist who is anxious to make a study of seaweeds, will\r\nfind little scope for his hobby on a sandy shore. Just as the most\r\ninteresting marine animals are to be found where rocks abound, so must\r\nwe hunt in similar situations for our _Algæ_. A few thread like _Algæ_\r\nare able to anchor themselves to the sand but most of them require\r\na substantial support. A bare rock is a much favoured situation and\r\nbefore we have learned the peculiarities of these plants we may marvel\r\nhow they obtain any sustenance from so barren a resting place. As a\r\nmatter of fact they derive no nourishment from the rocks on which they\r\nrest. The part of the sea weed which, in our ignorance, we may have\r\ndubbed a root, is nothing of the kind. It bears no relationship to the\r\nroots of higher plants and is a mere anchor, designed to fasten its\r\nowner to a support.\r\n\r\nNone of these plants have roots, none have true stems or leaves, though\r\nthe parts resembling stems and leaves are often so called; none of them\r\nflower and so fruits and seeds are unknown to them. Their food is\r\nabsorbed from the sea water over the whole of their surface.\r\n\r\nWe may well begin our study of the seaweeds with an examination of the\r\nexternal structure of as many different kinds as we can find. Some of\r\nthem are flattened and very thin forms and of them the Sea Lettuce may\r\nbe taken as typical. This plant, known to scientists as _Ulva Lactuca_,\r\noccurs at high-water mark. In its fully developed form it is pale\r\ngreen and so thin as to be almost transparent; its structure may be\r\nstudied under the microscope without difficulty. Then there is the very\r\ncommon, green, Compressed Enteromorpha which grows in great profusion\r\non the rocks of the shore, rendering them exceedingly slippery. The\r\nclosely related Intestinal Enteromorpha as it floats in the water\r\nresembles a green, membranous tube and those of us who have ever done\r\nany zoological dissection will appreciate how well named this plant is.\r\nThe structure of both the Enteromorphas can easily be seen. Many of the\r\nbrown and red _Algæ_ will provide us with a good deal of occupation\r\nin making out their structure. Some of them, the brown _Ectocarpus\r\nSiliculosus_ for example, may be found, growing in moss like tufts,\r\nwhich are usually attached to one of the larger _Algæ_ living between\r\nthe tide marks. It is one of the simplest of the brown sea weeds,\r\nconsisting of branched threads, but one cell in thickness. The Wracks,\r\nof which the Common Bladder Wrack or Pop weed with its little air\r\nfilled bladders is familiar to everyone, are more complicated in\r\nstructure, in fact they appear to be possessed of stems and leaves, but\r\nwe shall return to them in a moment.\r\n\r\nMost of the common red _Algæ_ are so delicate in structure that they\r\nrequire a fairly high magnification for their examination. The thin,\r\nmembranous fronds of the beautiful crimson _Delessera Sanguinea_, may\r\nbe sought below low tide limit or may be found washed up upon the\r\nshore. Superficially the plant resembles a red hart’s-tongue fern, with\r\nmuch more delicate fronds than ever fern of that species possessed. We\r\nmay well compare its structure with that of the sea lettuce, for it is\r\nequally transparent.\r\n\r\nIn the rock pools of many parts of the coast we may happen upon a\r\nmost curious almost white sea weed, known as Coralline or _Corallina\r\nOfficinalis_. Its branched, feathery stems are hard and stony and the\r\nwhole plant bears a superficial resemblance to a coral, hence its name.\r\nThe plant absorbs a substance known as calcium carbonate from the sea\r\nwater and deposits it in the form of a hard, stony covering over its\r\nsurface. Calcium carbonate does not occur in sea water everywhere, at\r\nleast not in sufficient quantity to be of use to the Coralline, that is\r\nthe reason the sea weed is not quite so common as some of the others we\r\nhave mentioned. The curious armour-plating of this sea dweller, should\r\nbe studied under the microscope.\r\n\r\nThe chief scientific interest of the sea weeds, however, lies in\r\ntheir mode of increase, it is so totally different from that of any\r\nof the higher plants. The most simple method of increase is known as\r\nvegetative reproduction, it does not occur in every kind of seaweed\r\nand is nothing more or less than the growth of a broken piece of plant\r\ninto a new individual. This form of increase is not unknown higher in\r\nthe plant world; begonia leaves may be induced to send forth roots and\r\ngrow into new plants, many garden favourites are propagated by means\r\nof cuttings and both these methods are similar to the breaking away\r\nand growth of portions of a seaweed; the garden plants, however, are\r\nassisted by man, the seaweed does its own work.\r\n\r\nThe simplest forms of increase occur amongst those giants of the\r\nsea, the Laminarias or Tangles as they are often called. These brown\r\nseaweeds often attain enormous sizes, they all grow below the limits of\r\nlow tide and appear to thrive best where the water is frequently lashed\r\nby storms. To see these plants at their best we must look down upon\r\nthem in their watery home. There are spots on the North-Eastern coast\r\nof Ireland, where one may look from the cliffs upon a veritable forest\r\nof Tangles. There thrives the “Devil’s Apron,” short of stem but with\r\na flat ribbon of a frond, which may attain a length of a dozen feet\r\nand a width of as many inches. There too we can behold the Fingered\r\nTangle, with stem, maybe, six feet in length and a crown of large\r\nfinger-like fronds, “Sea Laces” or “Dead Men’s Ropes,” with fronds\r\nresembling slender ropes, in length, at times as much as forty feet,\r\nride gracefully on the ever changing currents. Safely hidden in this\r\nmarine forest lurk queer fishes and crabs and shell fish. About the\r\nbroad fronds of the “Devil’s Apron” sea mice and sea cucumbers disport\r\nthemselves; the Tangle home is a paradise for marine life. Yet with all\r\ntheir vigorous growth they increase simply by liberating spores which\r\ngive rise to new plants.\r\n\r\nIn our chapter on Plant Life we described spores very briefly; we said\r\nthat from a strictly scientific point of view they were not comparable\r\nto seeds but that for our purpose they might be looked upon as seeds\r\nfor the reason that, by their germination, new plants were formed.\r\nAll the spores of land plants are minute, they are carried from the\r\nmother plant to suitable spots for germination by wind. The spores of\r\nseaweeds also are small, but they are very different to the little\r\nwind-blown, land-dwelling spores. They possess a pair of the curious\r\nlittle whip-like structures we have observed in so many water plants\r\nand animals. By the lashing of these little whips they are able to swim\r\nabout in the water till they find a suitable spot to settle down and\r\ngrow into plants similar to those whence they came. On account of their\r\nanimal-like movements they are called zoospores.\r\n\r\nThe formation of zoospores may be easily observed in the brown sea weed\r\n_Ectocarpus Siliculosus_ we have already mentioned. This plant, as we\r\nhave already remarked, consists of thin, thread-like rows of single\r\ncells and from time to time it is branched. At certain periods of the\r\nyear, moderately large, pear shaped swellings occur on the threads of\r\nthe sea-weed. If we are either fortunate or exceptionally patient we\r\nmay chance to be examining one of these swellings under the microscope\r\nat the moment when it bursts and sets free its contents. Should we have\r\nthis good fortune we must hasten to magnify more highly the zoospores\r\nwhich have escaped from the pear shaped spore case. Here we may add the\r\ncaution that we shall only witness the bursting of the spore case if\r\nwe examine our specimen in sea water; we should require more than the\r\npatience of Job to watch for its bursting in the dry state, for it will\r\nnever come to pass.\r\n\r\nA careful study of a zoospore will show that it swims in a peculiar\r\nmanner. One of the little whips is directed forwards, the other\r\ntrails behind. After a short period of activity the zoospore comes to\r\nrest, loses all means of propulsion, germinates and grows into a new\r\n_Ectocarpus_ plant.\r\n\r\nSometimes this _Algæ_ reaches a low ebb of vitality, it requires a\r\nnew lease of life as it were, when this state is reached another\r\nform of increase takes place. The events in this case may also be\r\nwitnessed under the microscope. From very similar spore cases a number\r\nof zoospores are liberated and for a time they swim about freely. If\r\nnow we watch carefully we shall notice that one of the active little\r\nbodies comes to rest and that the others lose no time in swarming round\r\nit. One of these swarming zoospores fuses with the individual which\r\nfirst ceased swimming about, with the result that a much larger,\r\nnon-swimming individual is formed which, after a short resting period,\r\ngerminates and grows into a new sea weed. The remainder of the\r\nzoospores will come to rest later and germinate to form new plants just\r\nas though no fusion had taken place with two of their number. Here we\r\nsee the beginnings of male and female increase amongst sea weeds; the\r\nindividual which first comes to rest is looked upon as the female and\r\nthe one with which it fuses as the male.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _By the courtesy of Messrs. F. Davidson & Co._\r\n\r\n  THE FEELER OF A COCKCHAFER\r\n\r\n    The end of the feeler consists of a number of plates, which can be\r\n    spread fanwise. The pores visible on the plates are the insect’s\r\n    organs of smell.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmongst the Wracks, of which there are a number of kinds, the methods\r\nof increase reach a higher stage. First of all let us describe the\r\nplants, so that we may know what to look for. They all belong to the\r\ngroup of brown _Algæ_. The “Channelled Wrack” is, when fully grown,\r\nabout six inches long. It is much branched, often almost yellowish in\r\ncolour and grows just below high-water mark. Along one side of the\r\nplant there is a moderately deep groove. Here we may note that the\r\nWracks grow in zones from just below high water mark to low water mark.\r\nA little nearer the sea than the haunts of the Channelled Wrack, we\r\nshall find the Flat and Bladder Wracks. The former is but six inches\r\nor so in length, with flat, forked fronds, along the centres of which\r\nruns a single rib. The Bladder Wrack varies considerably in size. It\r\nmay be smaller than either of the Wracks we have already mentioned or\r\nit may be two or three feet in length. It is the one seaweed familiar\r\nto everybody. Nearer to low tide mark we shall encounter the Knobbed\r\nWrack, greenish brown in colour and often as much as six feet in\r\nlength. It is so named because from the sides of its flat, leathery,\r\nstrap-like fronds, there arise little stalked bladders. Right at,\r\nand often beyond, low tide mark there dwells the Notched Wrack; very\r\nsimilar to, though larger than, the Flat Wrack, from which it may\r\neasily be distinguished by the fact that the edges of its fronds are\r\ntoothed, after the manner of a saw.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the structure of any one of these Wracks is much\r\nmore complicated than is the case with _Ectocarpus_. The latter Alga\r\nwas composed of a number of cells, similar to one another in every\r\nrespect except size. If we tease a stem or a frond of one of the Wracks\r\nupon a slide and examine the result of our efforts under the microscope\r\nwe shall see that the cells which compose the Wrack are not by any\r\nmeans similar to one another. Those of us who have mastered the, by\r\nno means difficult, art of section cutting, should cut sections of\r\nstem and frond and compare them with sections of leaf and stem of some\r\nhigher plant. The comparison will show us that, although the seaweed\r\ndoes not exhibit the complicated structure of a flowering plant, it\r\nhas at least three kinds of different cells--an outer layer, a central\r\nstructure and an intermediate layer.\r\n\r\nIf we secure a specimen of the Channelled Wrack, at the end of the\r\nsummer, we shall notice that the tips of certain of the fronds are\r\nswollen. Examination of these swellings under a low magnification will\r\nreveal a number of wart-like structures, and at the end of each wart\r\nthere is a little pore. If we open up one of these little warts, very\r\ncarefully with our mounted needles, we shall find that each little pore\r\nopens into a cavity, within which we can find two kinds of structures,\r\nhidden amongst a number of hair like growths. We shall see a number of\r\ndark, oval bodies, at the base of the hairs, these are the egg cells;\r\nmore careful search will show us a number of much branched structures\r\nalso partly concealed by the hairs, these are the male organs of the\r\nplants. The purpose of the hairs, by the way, is to keep the little\r\nchamber moist, when the plant is left high and dry. If we watch the\r\npores of the other warts carefully we may be fortunate enough to see\r\nthe process of increase taking place, for it occurs outside the plant\r\nand not within the chamber. The egg cell divides into two and its\r\ncontents pass out of the chamber by way of the pore; each cell of the\r\nmale organs gives rise to sixty-four oval little structures, each\r\nprovided with a pair of minute whip-like threads by means of which\r\nit swims from the chamber and goes in search of the egg cells. Many\r\nof these little navigators are lost by the way but one of them will\r\nreach and fuse with each egg cell. After fusion the new-formed cell\r\ngerminates at once into a new Channelled Wrack.\r\n\r\nThat this is an advance is shown by the fact that the little swimming\r\nbodies which fail to fuse with the egg cell, do not develop into new\r\nplants as in _Ectocarpus_ nor does the egg cell, which has failed to\r\nfuse with a swimming body, germinate.\r\n\r\nIn the Bladder Wrack, a very similar process takes place. There are,\r\nhowever, certain important differences, differences which show that the\r\nplant is still more highly developed. If we examine the cavities, in\r\nthe little warts of the Bladder Wrack we shall find that some of them\r\ncontain egg cells, some contain male organs but none contain both. We\r\nnoticed that the egg cell of the Channelled Wrack produced two eggs,\r\nthat of the Bladder Wrack produces eight. In other respects the two\r\nplants behave similarly.\r\n\r\nThe methods of increase amongst the red seaweeds are rather more\r\ncomplicated and as our object is to interest and not to puzzle\r\nour readers we will content ourselves with a few general remarks.\r\nMicroscopists who are anxious to probe more deeply into the subject\r\nwill soon devise ways and means for themselves. The little swimming\r\nbodies which lend an added attraction to the study of the brown\r\nseaweeds are replaced, amongst the red _Algæ_, by organisms with but\r\none whip-like structure apiece and that without the power of propelling\r\nits owner through the water. As with _Ectocarpus_, increase may take\r\nplace in two ways. On these red plants we may find the now familiar\r\nswellings, which we have learned to know are spore cases, but instead\r\nof the multitudes of free swimming organisms which are set free on\r\nthe bursting of the brown sea weed spore case, we now witness the\r\nexpulsion of but four inert spores, which settle down in the water and\r\nimmediately grow into new plants.\r\n\r\nIn the second method of increase, where male and female organs are\r\nconcerned, we find that both these structures grow on the outside\r\nof the plant and not in cavities. Let us take the common, pink,\r\nmuch branched seaweed, known by the fearsome name of _Callithamnion\r\nCorymbosum_ as our example. The male organs grow in little fungus\r\nlike tufts about the branches of the plant and they give off enormous\r\nnumbers of little organisms which have no power of swimming to the\r\nfemale organs. Either on the same or on another plant we shall find\r\nthe female organs; we need not describe them in detail but there is\r\none point of very great interest. From each of the female organs there\r\ngrows a long jelly-like hair. As we have remarked, the organisms set\r\nfree by the male organs cannot swim about but float aimlessly in the\r\nwater. Obviously the majority of them simply perish, one perchance may\r\ntouch a sticky hair to which it adheres, with which it fuses and passes\r\ndown to the female cell, resulting in the production of a new seaweed.\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that in writing about the pollen grains of\r\nflowering plants, we mentioned that those plants dependent upon\r\nwind for the distribution of their pollen, have stigmas ingeniously\r\ncontrived for catching and retaining the grains. It is curious that the\r\nred seaweeds should have very similar contrivances for capturing and\r\nretaining the male cells.\r\n\r\nThe sea will also provide us with a rich harvest of those beautiful\r\nmicroscopic objects, the Diatoms. They may be sought on seaweeds, their\r\nyellowish brown colour often betrays their whereabouts, on rocks and\r\nsand and in mud. The salt water forms are as varied and as beautiful as\r\ntheir fresh water cousins.\r\n\r\nTo the microscopist who merely uses his microscope for the pleasure he\r\ncan derive from it, rather than for serious study, it may appear that\r\nthe plant life of the sea falls short of the animal life as far as\r\ninterest is concerned. He may disabuse himself at once of this idea.\r\nThere is no class of plants more interesting than the seaweeds and in\r\nfew branches of plant life is there greater scope for new discoveries.\r\nThe garden of the sea is largely an unexplored territory and there\r\nis no coast-line in the world of equal extent which provides so many\r\ndifferent sea dwelling plants as our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE MICRO-TELESCOPE AND SUPER MICROSCOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nThose of our readers who have borne with us thus far may quite\r\nexcusably have thought that the last word had been attained in the\r\nconstruction of the microscope. It is true that different makers\r\nhave made various improvements to their instruments, from time to\r\ntime in recent years, most of them of minor importance but useful\r\nin the aggregate. But a few years ago, however, the advent of\r\nthe Micro-Telescope and Super-Microscope marked an epoch in the\r\nmanufacture of the microscope. We have shown that great strides\r\nwere made in scientific investigation when the first simple lenses\r\nwere manufactured, that there was a lull in microscopic research\r\ntill the appearance of the compound microscope and now, when the\r\nlatest instruments are in the hands of scientific workers, further\r\npossibilities are opened up.\r\n\r\nIn all microscopes--the best as well as the cheaper instruments--there\r\nis one failing which very early forces itself upon the user. They\r\nhave very little “depth of focus.” Let us explain exactly what the\r\nphrase means. Once or twice in our pages, we have recommended that the\r\nfine adjustment should be rotated to and fro while certain objects\r\nare being examined. When potato starch grains, for instance, are\r\nmagnified sufficiently highly to show their characteristic markings,\r\nthe whole of the grain cannot be seen clearly at one time, because\r\nat that magnification the “depth of focus” is slight. The higher the\r\nmagnification the less is the “depth of focus”; when this quality is\r\nabsent altogether only one plane of an object can be viewed clearly\r\nwithout re-adjusting the focus. With low magnifications, we may, to a\r\nlimited extent, have more than one plane of an object in focus.\r\n\r\nThe same question of “depth of focus” occurs in photography and perhaps\r\nan example showing how it affects the camera user may make the matter\r\nclearer. Suppose we wish to photograph a landscape having, let us say,\r\na tree in the foreground, a cottage in the mid-distance and a hill in\r\nthe distance. If our lens is one of large aperture, that is to say\r\nadmits a considerable amount of light and is also what is known as a\r\nlong focus lens we shall find, when we view the scene on the ground\r\nglass, that when the tree is sharply focussed, the cottage and hill\r\nare not clear. When we rack in the camera to get the cottage sharply\r\nfocussed, the tree and hill will be un-sharp. Similarly when we focus\r\non the hill the tree and cottage remain out of focus. The reason is\r\nthat the lens in our case possesses little “depth of focus.” The\r\nexperienced landscape photographer, did he wish all three objects to\r\nappear equally sharp could easily attain his object. He would perform\r\nthe simple operation known as stopping down his lens, that is to say\r\nhe would gradually close its diaphragm, while viewing the scene on\r\nthe ground glass. At a certain point everything would be sharp, from\r\nforeground to distance. At the smaller aperture of the lens, caused\r\nby closing the diaphragm, the depth of focus would be considerably\r\nincreased, at the same time much less light would be admitted to the\r\ncamera. Looking upon our object, under the microscope, as comparable\r\nto a landscape, seen on the ground glass focussing screen of a camera,\r\nit is obvious that, unless our object has no thickness, and this is\r\nimpossible, we cannot highly magnify its upper and lower surfaces\r\nat one and the same time. There are no adjustable diaphragms in the\r\nobjective so our only course is to examine the two surfaces in turn or\r\nto resort to a lower magnification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _By the courtesy of Messrs. F. Davidson & Co._\r\n\r\n  THE MICRO-TELESCOPE\r\n\r\n  1. View taken with ordinary camera. The arrow shows the building\r\n  illustrated in the plate below; it is 3/4 mile away.\r\n\r\n  2. The building indicated by the arrow in the plate above, taken from\r\n  the same standpoint through the micro-telescope.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nApart from any other consideration, the super microscope marks a big\r\nadvance from the fact that it possesses great “depth of focus.” It is\r\npossible, for example, with this remarkable instrument to examine a\r\nmoss as it grows, with a high magnification and see not a portion of\r\na leaf or a fragment of the stalk, as with the ordinary microscope,\r\nbut the whole upstanding plant, in stereoscopic relief. It shows us\r\nobjects exactly as we should see them were we endowed with super eyes,\r\nenormously enlarged, in relief and erect. Objects viewed through this\r\ninstrument are not inverted, as with the ordinary microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA is the microscope proper and is, in all respects, similar to the\r\ninstrument with which we are familiar, except that its mirror and\r\ncondenser have been removed. In the fitting provided for the condenser\r\na second microscope is arranged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis consists of a tube D, an objective F, an ocular C and an inner\r\nsliding tube E, the whole fits into the metal case B, G is a stage on\r\nwhich the object is placed and below G, if necessary, a condenser may\r\nbe fitted.\r\n\r\nThe instrument owes its remarkable magnifying powers to the fact that\r\nthe additional microscope B, forms a magnified image of the object on\r\nthe stage G, at the opening in the stage of the microscope A. This\r\nmagnified image is still further enlarged by the original microscope.\r\nIn other words, the power of one microscope is employed on that of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus as we have described it gives enormous magnifications\r\nand it is possible, by using a suitable combination of objectives,\r\nto obtain a magnification of ten thousand diameters. Expressed in\r\nnon-technical language, a circle whose actual diameter is equal to\r\nthe thickness of the paper upon which these words are printed, could\r\nbe so magnified by the super-microscope that it would appear to be as\r\nthick as ten thousand similar pieces of paper but, with this enormous\r\nmagnification, it is obvious that, even with such a marvellous\r\ninstrument, the whole of the circle from edge to edge could not be\r\nseen at one time. With an ordinary microscope a magnification of one\r\nthousand three hundred diameters is considered highly satisfactory.\r\nSo that there is a great probability of being able to see some of\r\nthe minute objects which are known to exist, but which have, up to\r\nthe present, eluded those who would view them, on account of their\r\nminuteness. There is a possibility also of discovering a new underworld\r\nof which no man has yet dreamed. The man who uses his microscope solely\r\nbecause of the pleasure he derives from it, rather than he who uses it\r\nbecause it is essential to his business or profession, will be more\r\nattracted by the micro-telescope. By this we do not infer that the\r\ninstrument is not useful, as a fact it is of the greatest importance in\r\ncertain cases, especially for Nature-study work, for the observation\r\nof minerals and to the chemist.\r\n\r\nLike its sister instrument, the micro-telescope consists of an ordinary\r\nmicroscope to which is attached a specially designed object glass in\r\na tube, which take the place of the condenser. The makers, indeed,\r\nprovide two of these object glasses--one for viewing objects from one\r\nto two feet away, the other for viewing objects from a distance of\r\nthree feet to the planets, if need be. Once when the instrument was\r\nbeing tested some crumbs were placed on the floor at a distance of\r\nfour yards and strongly illuminated, and the microscope with a 1-inch\r\nobjective focussed on the crumbs. With this objective in an ordinary\r\nmicroscope the magnification would be about thirty diameters. Presently\r\nsome mice came out, and made themselves at home with the crumbs. The\r\nmice could be examined at this distance, without their being aware of\r\nit, so well that individual hairs were easily visible and about half a\r\nmouse was in the field of view. In point of size each mouse appeared\r\nabout the same as a beaver within a foot or two.\r\n\r\nMessrs F. Davidson & Co., 29 Great Portland Street, London, are well\r\nknown for the high state of perfection to which they have brought the\r\nmicro-telescope and other instruments connected with microscopy.\r\n\r\nThe novelty of the micro-telescope will appeal strongly to the Nature\r\nlover. At a distance of a few feet a spider can be magnified to the\r\nsize of a large cat, and it can be watched spinning its web with\r\nspinnerettes the size of teacups. Ants at a distance of six feet are\r\nseen to be fearsome individuals, six inches in length, and their\r\ntiny burdens are so magnified that they appear like yule logs or\r\ngoodly-proportioned boulders, according to their nature. At a distance\r\nof ten feet a wasp may be seen scraping tiny shavings of wood from oak\r\npalings by means of its jaws--shavings which it converts into paper\r\nfor building its nest. Very small insects may be observed as they come\r\ninto the world from their chrysalis stage. The never-tiring jaws of\r\nthe caterpillar may be seen at work devouring some favourite leaf--the\r\nwhole action of biting and swallowing the vegetable matter can be\r\nplainly seen. Such interesting events as the tending of green flies by\r\nants, the leaf-cutting habits of the leaf-cutter bee, and a hundred and\r\none other events are all revealed by the micro-telescope and at such a\r\ndistance that the living objects are not disturbed in their activities,\r\nbeing quite unaware that they are under observation. To the botanist\r\nthe instrument is no less useful.\r\n\r\nIn various manufactures, such as ore smelting, and in the manufacture\r\nof glass, china and pottery, in enamelling and in certain engineering\r\nshops, where it is necessary to examine material at a high temperature,\r\nthe micro-telescope is a great boon, and, at least, is the means\r\nof avoiding considerable physical discomfort. It is used also by\r\narchitects and surveyors for examining the condition of the factory\r\nchimneys, bridges, derricks and the like. To the engineer the\r\ninstrument is invaluable; we have explained elsewhere how necessary it\r\nis that various metals and mixtures of metals should be examined for\r\nfractures. Under the high magnification with the ordinary microscope,\r\neven with an instrument specially designed for the work, only a\r\nvery small area can be studied at once. With the micro-telescope a\r\nrelatively large area may be examined under a high magnifying power.\r\n\r\nThere are three features of this ingenious apparatus which cannot fail\r\nto commend themselves equally to the casual worker and the serious\r\nmicroscopist. All objects are seen erect, just as the eye sees them.\r\nThis is brought about because, as in the case of the super-microscope,\r\nwe really observe a magnified, inverted image of our object, formed at\r\nthe spot where the object would be placed were we using an ordinary\r\nmicroscope. This image is inverted once more in the microscope and so\r\nit appears to us erect.\r\n\r\nAll objects appear in relief and in their proper planes; this is seen\r\nin a striking manner by viewing an ordinary photograph through the\r\napparatus, when the various parts stand out as in nature. There is also\r\nenormous depth of focus. With the attachment for viewing objects at a\r\nshort distance, the whole of a tubular shaped flower such as a daffodil\r\nmay be in focus at once, from the tip of the petals to the bottom of\r\nthe tube. With the attachment designed for long distance work, objects\r\nfrom twenty yards to sixty miles may be clearly viewed at one and the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nA few of the unsolved problems confronting the microscopist are\r\nreviewed in our concluding chapter. Whether they will ever be solved\r\nwe dare not venture to say; but, if they are to be, surely to this\r\nlatest arrival in the microscopic world and to its companion, the\r\nsuper-microscope, the honours will go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY AND THE MICROSCOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo thoroughly comprehend the various uses to which the chemist may put\r\nhis microscope, it is necessary to have a knowledge of chemistry. The\r\nscience is so wide in its scope that no single chapter could do justice\r\nto it. There are analytical chemists, scientists whose aim is to find\r\nout the composition of various substances; biological chemists who deal\r\nwith the many problems of life in which chemistry plays a part, but we\r\nneed not attempt to detail all the branches of this highly specialised\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nChemical analysis is founded upon the fact that when certain\r\nchemicals are mixed together they will, or they may, unite to form\r\nquite a different chemical. This newly formed chemical is probably\r\na different colour to the substances which were used in its making,\r\nor again the original chemicals may be soluble in water and the new\r\nchemical insoluble, in which case it will form a cloudiness known as\r\na precipitate. An example may help to make our description clearer.\r\nSuppose we take some common table salt and dissolve it in a little\r\nwater in a glass, then add to this a little solution of nitrate of\r\nsilver, which is sold under the name of lunar caustic, we shall find\r\nthat a white cloudiness is formed when the liquids mix, although\r\noriginally they were both clear. The reason of this cloudiness is that\r\nthe two substances, dissolved in water have united with one another to\r\nform a third substance which will not dissolve, therefore it settles\r\ndown as a fine powder. Long experience has taught analytical chemists\r\nexactly what chemicals to add to test for all the common substances, by\r\nthe formation of these precipitates; so that, if any powder were given\r\nto one of these scientists he could tell its composition by applying\r\ncertain tests. In this chemical analysis considerable quantities are\r\nrequired and it is often necessary to test very small samples, so small\r\nthat the ordinary methods are out of the question. This is where the\r\nmicroscope scores, because with this wonderful instrument, only drops\r\nare required and tests of corresponding delicacy may be made; in fact,\r\nby modern microscopic methods it is possible to detect the presence of\r\nas little as ten thousandth part of a grain of arsenic, or quicksilver\r\nor of the deadly poisons, Strychnine or Prussic Acid.\r\n\r\nIn testing for poisons the microscope is invaluable. Frequently only\r\nthe most minute traces of the poison occur in the system and the modern\r\nmicroscopist who makes a study of poisons and their detection can\r\nsolve mysteries which would have baffled all the scientists in the\r\nworld in days gone by.\r\n\r\nOur chemical studies with the microscope may well begin with various\r\ncommon crystals; they are usually easy to prepare; the process of\r\ncrystallization is always interesting to watch, and as objects for the\r\nmicroscope it would be difficult to find anything more beautiful than\r\nthese home-made gems. All crystals should be examined by reflected\r\nas well as by transmitted light. When we are working with the former\r\nlighting, a piece of black paper beneath the slide will help to show up\r\nthe objects to better advantage.\r\n\r\nThe easiest method of obtaining crystals of any substance which is\r\nsoluble in water is to make a saturated solution in this liquid, to\r\nput a small drop upon a slide, then to tilt the microscope slightly so\r\nthat there is a thin film of solution at the upper side of the drop.\r\nThe microscope must not be tilted so much that the liquid runs from the\r\nslide on to the stage. Where the film of liquid is thin crystals will\r\nbe found first. A word of explanation is necessary concerning the term\r\nsaturated solution, especially as we may have occasion to use it many\r\ntimes. When we add a solid to a liquid in which it is soluble, we shall\r\nfind that the liquid will take up a certain amount of the solid and no\r\nmore; when, on the addition of more solid it fails to dissolve, we have\r\nreached the saturation point. A saturated solution then is a liquid in\r\nwhich the maximum amount of solid is dissolved.\r\n\r\nWe have already described the most simple way in which crystals may\r\nbe formed, and we may easily make objects for our microscope in\r\nthis manner of all the substances we can find which are soluble in\r\nwater. With some we shall find that crystals do not form easily, in\r\nwhich event we may modify our tactics and warm one drop of saturated\r\nsolution on the slide till nearly all the moisture is driven off, then\r\nthere should be no difficulty in watching the crystals in process\r\nof formation. Common salt, sugar, alum, borax, washing soda, iron\r\nsulphate, called also green vitriol and copper sulphate, or blue\r\nvitriol, are common and easily obtained substances, all soluble in\r\nwater. As we carry our experiments a little further we shall find that\r\ncrystals formed from cold solutions as suggested in our first method\r\ndiffer from those formed from hot solutions. Again, if we use some\r\nother substance than water as our solvent the crystals which separate\r\nout will differ once more. Many very interesting experiments may be\r\ntried on these lines.\r\n\r\nMany beautiful crystals may be obtained by dissolving various\r\nsubstances in gelatine or gum. The method is simple. Gently warm\r\na little gelatine, to which is added an equal volume of water, in\r\na chemist’s test-tube. When the gelatine has all dissolved make a\r\nsaturated solution of the substance, from which crystals are derived.\r\nGreen or blue vitriol are good subjects for the experiment. Add a\r\nlittle of the saturated solution to the gelatine and stir with a glass\r\nrod, taking care to avoid the formation of air bubbles. A little of\r\nthe mixture may now be placed in a thin film on a slide covered with a\r\ncover slip and left to cool. Examination when cool under the microscope\r\nwill show lovely fern-like crystals, whose beauty rivals that of ice\r\ncrystals familiar to us on our window panes during hard weather in the\r\nwinter. Barium chloride also produces very beautiful fern-like crystals\r\nwhen treated in this manner. Chlorate of potash, familiar to most of\r\nus as a remedy for sore throat, forms crystals totally dissimilar to\r\nthose substances we have named. Having made as many crystals as we wish\r\nfrom water and also from gelatine solutions, we may turn our attention\r\nto gum arabic. The method of obtaining crystals from this substance\r\nis exactly similar to that described for gelatine except, of course,\r\nthat we substitute gum for gelatine. This work is of the greatest\r\ninterest, for not only does it yield wonderfully beautiful objects for\r\nour microscope, but it is a hobby full of surprises. When we are about\r\nto examine a new crystal for the first time we can never so much as\r\nhazard what shape it will assume. Sugar, it may be mentioned, does not\r\ncrystallize at once from a saturated solution in water, and the best\r\nmethod of obtaining the crystals is to warm the slide, on which we have\r\nplaced a drop of solution, and then when dry to set aside for a day; at\r\nthe end of that time, especially if the air be moist, the crystals will\r\nhave formed.\r\n\r\nWe shall find it interesting to try experiments in mixing two different\r\nsubstances, then we shall probably obtain crystals totally unlike those\r\nof either of the ingredients. As an example of this method, let us\r\nmake a saturated solution of a mixture of blue vitriol and magnesium\r\nsulphate in water. Place a drop of the solution on a slide, heat over\r\na flame, not only till dry, but till the substance left on the slide\r\nbegins to melt. We must use every care not to crack the slide, and this\r\nmay best be accomplished by keeping it moving while over the flame.\r\nNow if we watch our object through our microscope we can witness the\r\nformation of wonderful feathery crystals, as the slide cools.\r\n\r\nSome strikingly beautiful results may be obtained in another manner;\r\nthe method is used by analysts in their so-called fusion tests. We\r\ntake a small grain of some substance, say, lead nitrate, place it in\r\nthe centre of our slide, cover with a cover slip, and warm over a\r\nflame till it melts. Then, taking a similar-sized grain of another\r\nsubstance, such as saltpetre, we place it against the edge of the cover\r\nslip on the side opposite to the lead nitrate. Further warming will\r\ncause the saltpetre to melt, and run below the slide and mix with the\r\nlead nitrate. If we watch the meeting of the two chemicals a wonderful\r\nsight will reward us. The lead compound forms a “beautiful crystalline\r\nskeleton,” whilst the saltpetre forms six-sided stars at the opposite\r\nside of the cover slip. The experiment may be repeated, using lunar\r\ncaustic and saltpetre, also the iodides of silver and potassium; in\r\nfact we may try any chemical substances we have at hand, though we\r\nshall find that some do not melt very easily, and potassium chlorate\r\nis somewhat dangerous, for it forms explosive compounds with certain\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nThe number of interesting and beautiful objects which may be obtained\r\nby so-called solution tests is practically unlimited, and the\r\nenthusiastic microscopist will certainly try all the tests we describe\r\nas well as many others of his own invention. Should the chemist wish to\r\ndetect the presence of aluminium in very small quantities, he relies on\r\nhis microscope and proceeds in the following manner. He takes a drop of\r\nthe solution, suspected of containing alum, and adds to it a drop of\r\nsulphuric acid. This mixture he puts on his slide, which he heats over\r\na flame till dry. Now he adds a drop of water, and then a very small\r\namount of calcium chloride is brought to the edge of the water. Beneath\r\nhis microscope he can now watch the formation of beautiful colourless,\r\neight-sided crystals which denote the presence of aluminium.\r\n\r\nA word of warning is necessary concerning this and the following\r\nexperiments; they may not always succeed, for success largely depends\r\nupon having the solutions at the right strength, and experience alone\r\ncan teach us what is correct. Interesting and easily formed crystals\r\nmay be obtained from barium sulphate, and the experiment may also be\r\nmade to show the phenomenon which we have already mentioned, that the\r\nform of the crystals depends on the nature of their solution. A little\r\nbarium sulphate should be dissolved in strong sulphuric acid. Here, by\r\nthe way, another warning: every care should be taken in the use of all\r\nacids; they should never be allowed to come into contact with face,\r\nhands or clothes, nor should they touch any part of the microscope.\r\nSome acids give off fumes, and these should not be allowed to reach\r\nthe eyes or nose, and the microscope must be protected from them. To\r\ncontinue our experiment: While hot a drop of the solution of barium\r\nsulphate in sulphuric acid should be transferred by means of a glass\r\nrod to a slide and allowed to cool. Examination with the microscope\r\nwill show that the barium sulphate has formed small rectangular\r\nscales. With the remainder of the sulphuric acid we now make a\r\nsaturated solution of barium sulphate, and find, on repeating the\r\nmethod described above, that the chemical has formed curious x-shaped\r\ncrystals. Similar experiments may be tried with calcium sulphate with\r\nthe certainty of interesting results.\r\n\r\nMany crystals of calcium, in the form of calcium oxalate, may be\r\nfound in plants, and they are well worth looking for. They may best\r\nbe seen in sections of the plants, but, if we have not mastered the\r\nart of cutting sections, we may find them by teasing the plant cells\r\napart with our mounted needles. In the stems of rhubarb there is the\r\nsubstance in bundles of long needle-shaped crystals, to which the name\r\nof raphides has been given. In the seed of the garden poppy, just below\r\nthe skin, there is a layer known as the crystal layer, where crystals\r\nof calcium oxalate occur as tiny balls called crystal sand. In the leaf\r\nstalks of begonias very beautiful and occasionally very large crystals\r\nof this substance may be found, whilst in shapes they are strikingly\r\nvaried. In orris root there are enormous crystals of calcium oxalate;\r\nin fact it is common in many plants.\r\n\r\nIf we have a photographic friend who will supply us with quite a small\r\nquantity of gold chloride, we shall be in a position to try three most\r\ninteresting experiments and to obtain some curious crystals. We require\r\na very weak solution of gold chloride in water, not more than 3.5 per\r\ncent. for our first experiment. Mix one drop of this solution with the\r\nsame quantity of hydrochloric acid on a slide and heat over a flame\r\ntill dry. The microscope will now show us probably the most curious\r\ncrystals we have ever examined; some are long, some short, and some a\r\nzigzag in form; mixed with these there will be a few flat plate-like\r\ncrystals with rectangular projections. All these curious crystals are\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nIf instead of hydrochloric acid we use a solution of common salt in\r\nwater and repeat the experiment as before, we shall obtain pale yellow\r\nprisms and some crystals of common salt. Gold is costly, so it is\r\nperhaps lucky that one of the tests for this rare metal is one of the\r\nmost delicate known to chemists; it is possible, in fact, to detect\r\nvery minute quantities of gold. For this experiment we may take an\r\nexceedingly weak solution of gold chloride and place a drop on our\r\nslide; we also require a solution of the chloride of tin, known as\r\nstannous chloride, in an evil smelling liquid called chlorine water. If\r\nnow we watch our drop of gold solution under the microscope, and while\r\nwatching mix with it a drop of stannous chloride solution, a strikingly\r\nbeautiful purple colouration is produced--this purple has been named\r\nthe purple of Cassius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _By the courtesy of Messrs. F. Davidson & Co._\r\n\r\n  1.

HOOKS ON BEE’S WING\r\n\r\n    The row of hooks on the margin of the bee’s wing are clearly shown.\r\n    By their aid the fore and hind wings are fastened together when the\r\n    insect flies.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf we desire further experiments in the testing of common substances,\r\nand incidentally in the production of beautiful crystals, we might do\r\nworse than try the effect of adding a solution of platinum chloride to\r\nany solution containing a compound of potassium. Charmingly beautiful\r\ncrystals will result.\r\n\r\nThe experiments we have described as well as hundreds of others are\r\nused by analysts every day in the testing of various substances. We\r\nhave started in every case by knowing what our solutions contain; the\r\nduty of the analyst is to discover what he has before him. Given an\r\nunlimited quantity of a substance for testing purposes it is not always\r\neasy to determine its composition. With very small quantities, perhaps\r\nless than a tea-spoon full in all, the difficulties of the analyst\r\nare increased tenfold and without the assistance of the microscope\r\nhis efforts would be unavailing, he deals in drops and every drop is\r\nprecious. Sad to relate this form of testing, known to science as\r\nmicro-chemical analysis, has been practised to a far greater extent on\r\nthe continent than in this country.\r\n\r\nThose of our readers who wish to try the experiments we have described\r\nfor themselves can obtain all the necessary substances, except the\r\npoisons, at any chemists and the quantities required will only be the\r\nsmallest that can be obtained, in fact any reasonable-minded chemist\r\nwould probably let a microscopist whom he knew have a few grains of a\r\nlarge number of chemical substances, suitable for this work, at the\r\noutlay of a few pence. The chlorides of gold and platinum we fear no\r\none will give away.\r\n\r\nAll the experiments we have described thus far have necessitated the\r\nuse of what are called inorganic substances, they may be described in\r\nevery day language as substances derived from the inanimate world.\r\nThere are many equally interesting tests which may be carried out with\r\nanimal and vegetable products.\r\n\r\nFormic acid is the substance which renders the sting of ants so\r\npainful; it may, however, be prepared artificially and if a little,\r\ndissolved in water, is mixed with a solution of silver nitrate we shall\r\nobtain flat plate like crystals also some resembling fine fibres.\r\n\r\nProbably the most curious of the easily obtained crystals from\r\nvegetable products, may be made from citric acid which occurs in\r\nlemons. If a little of the acid be mixed with a solution of caustic\r\nsoda and boiled with calcium chloride, a drop of the liquid after\r\nboiling placed on a slide will give crystals readily. When viewed from\r\nabove they are an elongated oval shape, described by some authorities\r\nas resembling a whetstone. Viewed from the side they have a striking\r\nsimilarity to small sheaves of wheat.\r\n\r\nWith the recognition of poisons under the microscope we need not\r\ntrouble ourselves here. It would be useless to describe any of the\r\nexperiments, for few of us could obtain such deadly substances as\r\nnicotine, strychnine, aconite, morphia and the like. Nevertheless the\r\nrecognition of these and similar substances in very minute quantities\r\nis rendered easy, to those who have the necessary knowledge, by means\r\nof the microscope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF THE MICROSCOPE IN MANUFACTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn how many branches of commerce, we wonder, does the microscope\r\nplay its part. It is used in several departments of engineering for\r\nexamining steels and many other metals not only for defects but to\r\nsee how they are made up. It is used in brewing for studying the\r\nvarious yeasts and other substances, including the hops which go to\r\nthe making of beer. All manufactures which depend upon fermentation,\r\nsuch as wine and vinegar making, are largely dependent upon the work\r\nof the microscope. In dairy work the microscope is invaluable. In the\r\nexamination of various fabrics the assistance of the microscope is\r\nalways summoned. Paper manufacture and paper testing give work for\r\nthe microscopist but it would, we think, be easier to give a list of\r\nthe branches of commerce in which the microscope is not used than to\r\nattempt to enumerate those which make use of the instrument.\r\n\r\nWe cannot possibly describe all the uses to which the microscope is\r\nput, so we will confine ourselves to one or two of the more important\r\nand, at the same time, to those which can, for the most part be\r\nrepeated at home.\r\n\r\nThe two most important commodities for mankind are food and clothing;\r\nwe cannot live without food and those of us who take but little pride\r\nin our appearance, must have clothing of some sort. We have said a\r\nlittle about food in another chapter and there we have also mentioned\r\nthe impurities which find their way, by accident or design, into some\r\nof the commoner foods.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we will deal first of all with clothing describing\r\nhow many of the raw materials may be recognised under the microscope\r\nand showing very briefly how fraud in connection with the manufacture\r\nof wearing apparel is detected. Practically all clothing is made from\r\nanimal or vegetable fibres, some, however, is made of artificial fibres\r\nand these we shall mention.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable fibres used in the manufacture of wearing apparel are\r\nall either hairs or what are called bast fibres and the latter, in\r\nnon-scientific language, may be described as the strands which run\r\nthrough the roots and stems of most plants. The chief requirements of\r\nvegetable fibres, destined to be woven into fabrics, are strength, it\r\nis obvious that a weak fibre would be useless; length, the longer the\r\nfibre the better and as we shall see later, short fibres are often made\r\nup into inferior material; pliability, a stiff fibre would make an\r\nuncomfortable fabric; firmness and durability. Animal fibres used in\r\nthe manufacture are either hairs or silk.\r\n\r\nThe most important vegetable fibre is cotton, it consists of the hairs\r\nfrom the seed coats of several species of _Gossypium_, a plant closely\r\nrelated to our common mallow. There are very many different kinds of\r\ncotton and the qualities of the fibres of these different cottons vary\r\ntremendously. Each hair is one cell and more or less spindle shaped,\r\nthat is to say, thicker towards the middle than at the base. If we\r\ncan obtain a little raw cotton we should certainly examine it under\r\nthe microscope; this may best be done by laying one or two fibres in\r\na drop of water on a slide. Under the low power, the first thing that\r\nwill attract our attention is the fact that the fibres are twisted,\r\ncorkscrew fashion, though not regularly nor throughout their whole\r\nlength. This curious twisting makes raw cotton easily recognised and it\r\nis, at the same time, a very valuable peculiarity of these plant hairs.\r\nThe greater the number of twists and the greater their regularity, the\r\nmore valuable the cotton becomes for weaving purposes. Under a higher\r\nmagnification, we recognise other characteristics of the cotton fibre.\r\nEach fibre is somewhat flattened, its edges are thick and, running up\r\nthe centre, there is a fairly broad lumen, as it is called. Covering\r\nthe whole there is a skin which by the way is often wanting in the\r\nfibres of cotton fabric owing to the chemicals with which the raw\r\ncotton has been treated and also to the methods of manufacture.\r\n\r\nA very striking experiment may be tried by soaking a few cotton fibres\r\nin cuprammonia, a substance prepared by the action of ammonia solution\r\non copper filings. Constrictions occur at fairly regular intervals\r\nalong the fibre so that, after treatment with cuprammonia, the cotton\r\nfibres resemble strings of little beads.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of mercerised cotton has become very important of late\r\nyears. The process is named after its inventor, Mercer, and consists\r\nin removing the skin from the fibres, causing them to untwist and, by\r\ndoing so, to impart to them a lustre of silk. We may make a little\r\nmercerised cotton for examination under the microscope by soaking some\r\nraw fibres for a short time in a solution of caustic soda or caustic\r\npotash and then washing them in water to which a little acid has been\r\nadded. This will cause the fibres to untwist and also destroy the\r\nskin, but we shall probably notice that the fibres have shrunk. In the\r\nprocess of manufacture precautions are taken to prevent this shrinking\r\nfor then the lustre is much better. We shall also observe that in our\r\nmercerised fibres the lumen has become very narrow and it is often\r\nbroken, here and there are swellings on the outside of each fibre,\r\ncorresponding to the positions of the twists. Mercerised cotton, in\r\naddition to its lustre, is stronger and absorbs dyes more easily than\r\nordinary cotton.\r\n\r\nFlax consists of the bast fibres of the flax plant. Examination\r\nof the raw product under the microscope will reveal both long and\r\nshort fibres. The former are the more valuable and are used in the\r\nmanufacture of linen, the latter are made into tow. The long fibres,\r\nwhich are derived from the upper parts of the flax plant have thickened\r\nedges and a very small lumen. The short fibres, used for making tow,\r\ncome from the lower part of the stem and the roots of the plant. Each\r\nfibre has a broad lumen and is very similar to hemp fibre. Examination\r\nof all these fibres, by the way, is best made in water as described\r\nunder cotton.\r\n\r\nHemp is another bast fibre and as we have remarked it resembles the\r\nshort fibres of flax; there is a broad lumen with an indistinct\r\nmargin. If we have an opportunity of comparing these fibres under the\r\nmicroscope we shall see that many of those of hemp have forked ends.\r\nThis is very characteristic of the plant and is never found in flax,\r\ntherefore it affords a ready means of distinguishing hemp from flax.\r\nFine linen should never contain hemp, so that if our object be to test\r\nthe quality of a sample of linen by microscopic examination, we must\r\nkeep a sharp look out for the forked fibres of hemp. In coarse linen\r\nthese fibres occur for hemp is used in its manufacture.\r\n\r\nJute, another important fibre is readily distinguished under the\r\nmicroscope, for its margins have perfectly smooth walls and its lumen\r\nis wide in some places, narrow in others and interrupted altogether in\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photos by Flatters & Garnett_\r\n\r\n  A SPIDER’S FOOT\r\n\r\n    The toothed claws are well adapted to enable their owner to obtain\r\n    a firm grasp of the fine threads of its web.\r\n\r\n  THE FOOT OF A FLY\r\n\r\n    The two claws enable the fly to walk up rough surfaces, whilst the\r\n    suckers between the claws give it a firm hold on smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere are an extraordinary number of vegetable fibres which are woven\r\ninto articles of commerce, of one kind and another. Then again, many\r\nfibres are so short or so brittle that they cannot be woven but are\r\nused for other purposes such as filling cushions, cheap bedding, etc.\r\nThere are also a certain number of vegetable fibres which are valuable\r\nbecause they are stiff and bristle-like as well as durable, and they\r\nare used for brushes, door mats and for similar purposes. To the\r\nmicroscopist who is interested in this work there is a wide field open.\r\n\r\nFor the examination of paper, which may be described as a “felt of\r\nfinely divided fibres,” the microscope is invaluable. The essentials of\r\na good paper are that it be durable, that it retain its colour and not\r\nbecome brittle. The least observant of us cannot fail to have noticed\r\nthat there are an extraordinary number of different kinds of paper,\r\nnot only the many kinds which the paper manufacturers could show us,\r\nbut the obviously varied papers which we meet with every day. Added to\r\nthe papers, there are cardboards which are really a kind of paper. It\r\nis clear, therefore, that the man who can tell us exactly how any and\r\nevery paper is made and what it is made of has laid up a goodly store\r\nof knowledge. In carrying out tests of paper we rely partly on chemical\r\nand partly on microscopic tests.\r\n\r\nA number of substances contribute to the manufacture of paper; linen\r\nand cotton rags, hemp and various fibres are the most commonly used,\r\nnot forgetting wood pulp which we shall mention in a moment. The\r\nfinest and whitest paper is made from linen rags and that from unused\r\nlinen and hemp is the strongest. Without attempting to describe in\r\ndetail or even in outline the different processes which the various\r\nvegetable fibres must undergo before they appear in the guise of\r\npaper, we may say the treatment is very drastic. Strong chemicals and\r\nmachinery designed to reduce the fibre to the finest possible particles\r\nrender the examination of paper, for the purpose of discovering its\r\ncomposition, far from easy. Such fibres as survive the rough treatment\r\nare mere fragments yet they are often large enough for the lynx eyed\r\nmicroscope to read their story. Formerly the constituents of most\r\npapers could be separated into three classes according to their\r\nbehaviour with iodine solution, but this test has been superseded by\r\nmore complicated methods which do not concern us here.\r\n\r\nThe examination of various papers may prove interesting for example in\r\nlinen rag paper, we ought to find some flax fibres, they will be sadly\r\nbattered and torn but are usually recognisable under the microscope.\r\nHemp paper is tough and is used for bank notes, in it some of the\r\nshort tow fibres will probably occur and they will give a clue to its\r\ncomposition. Cotton rag paper is easily recognised for the fibres are\r\nvery characteristic, a remark which also applies to jute paper, the\r\nso-called manila used for envelopes, wrappers, etc.\r\n\r\nMechanical wood pulp which enters so largely into the manufacture of\r\npaper is easily recognised by those who have given a fair amount of\r\nattention to the microscopical examination of plant life. Wood pulp is\r\nalways used in conjunction with some binding material such as cotton\r\nor flax fibres. Many different kinds of wood are converted into pulp\r\nand of course it requires a considerable amount of experience to say\r\nexactly what kind of wood has been used in a certain paper. Some of\r\nthe woods are poplars of various kinds, others spruces and firs. It is\r\neasy to distinguish the conifers as spruces and firs are called, for\r\nthe reason that the trees bear cones. The little fragments of wood,\r\nscattered throughout the paper, have minute circular perforations upon\r\nthem, resembling miniature quoits, if they belong to the conifers; none\r\nof the other woods possess these “pits” as they are called.\r\n\r\nVery many other plant remains may be found in paper, for instance\r\nhop fibres are used sometimes and their presence is usually shown by\r\nremnants of the climbing hooks which, during life, studded the climbing\r\nstem of the hop.\r\n\r\nSome of the important animal hairs, used in the manufacture of\r\nclothing, may now claim our attention. Wool and silk are of course the\r\nmost important. The best wool is all obtained from the domestic sheep\r\nso let us examine one or two of the easily obtained hairs from this\r\nanimal. As with the vegetable fibres we may examine them in a drop of\r\nwater but, in this case, we shall find that we cannot make the water\r\ngo near the wool for the reason that the latter is covered with a film\r\nof grease, called wool fat. Our first care, therefore, it to get rid of\r\nthe wool fat and this may be done by shaking the specimen with a little\r\nether or chloroform.\r\n\r\nHaving cleaned the wool fibres we may proceed to examine them under\r\na high magnification and, to see their structure fully, we must move\r\nthe fine adjustment to and fro, for it is not possible to obtain a\r\ntrue idea of its structure without doing so. We shall see that the\r\nhair consists of two layers, an outer skin and an inner core. The\r\nlatter consists of a number of cells, whilst the former is composed of\r\nscales, of which the lower edges are arranged beneath the upper edges\r\nof the previous scales, like tiles on a roof. The free edges of the\r\nscales project outwards a little so that the wool, when not so highly\r\nmagnified, appears to have a toothed margin. Further examination will\r\nshow us that no single scale completely envelops the strand of wool,\r\nusually two scales make the complete circuit. It is a curious and\r\neasily tested phenomenon that in say an inch of wool from the same\r\nkind of sheep there are always the same number or very nearly the same\r\nnumber of scales. By counting the scales, experts can tell from what\r\nanimal the wool is derived.\r\n\r\nIf we examine many samples of wool we shall not be long before we\r\nencounter certain specimens showing one or more constrictions. Now we\r\nall know that the reason why some people do not grow very much is\r\nbecause they are delicate, ill health affects the whole system. The\r\nconstrictions in the sheep’s wool occur because the animal has suffered\r\nfrom some illness, or from great hunger or thirst, which has resulted\r\nin its wool not growing properly for a period corresponding to the\r\nduration of the illness or other calamity.\r\n\r\nThe examination of various animal hairs will help to while away many\r\nan hour and many of these objects are of the greatest interest. If we\r\nhave the opportunity it will be interesting to compare the wool from\r\ndifferent kinds of sheep, that from the Lincoln sheep, for example\r\ndiffers from that of shortwooled kinds. We may also compare goat’s wool\r\nwith sheep’s, then there are differences between the hair of cows and\r\ncalves. Comparisons always make microscopic work more interesting.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic examination of cloth, used for making our coats, is\r\nquite interesting work and withal important. A good deal of the cloth\r\nwhich is made up into suits is known as shoddy, that is to say that\r\nmaterial that has been worn before; old rags of all sorts and many\r\nother extraordinary things go to the making of this cloth. There are\r\nspecial factories to which rags are sent to be made up into shoddy. One\r\nmight think therefore that this substance would be easily recognised\r\nunder the microscope but it is not quite so easy as we shall see.\r\nAbsolutely pure wool from the sheep giving the best quality wool is\r\nonly used in the very finest and most expensive fabrics. In a great\r\ndeal of really good cloth we may recognise other hairs besides those of\r\nthe sheep and sometimes vegetable fibres find their way into good cloth\r\nby accident. A piece of suspected cloth should be cut off and separated\r\nas far as possible into its different fibres. In shoddy we shall find\r\nfew long fibres and they will all be much torn for the reason that the\r\nrags from which the material is made are cut up in the manufacture. If\r\nwe find cotton fibres, we may be certain that our specimen is shoddy,\r\nalso if we can find fibres of many different colours, though the final\r\ndyeing may have disguised the fact that the fibres have originally\r\nfigured in fabrics of various colours.\r\n\r\nSilk is one of the most important of all fibres capable of being woven\r\ninto fabric. It is hardly necessary to remark that it is formed by\r\nthe fully fed silkworm just before it turns into a chrysalis. A very\r\nlarge number of caterpillars spin silk but the majority of this silk is\r\nuseless for commercial purposes. The silkworm gives off a double thread\r\nof silk from glands in its mouth and, at the same time, it gives off a\r\nsticky substance called silk glue which sticks the two fibres together,\r\nso that, to the eye at least they appear as one fibre.\r\n\r\nMost of us have kept silkworms, those who have not may find it worth\r\nwhile to expend a few pence in some of these insects for the sake of\r\nexamining the raw silk. A cocoon, as the work of the caterpillar is\r\ncalled, consists of three layers, an outer layer of floss, a middle\r\nlayer and a so-called layer (the inner layer) of parchment. Only the\r\nmiddle layer is used in commerce, the floss is too fine and weak and\r\nthe parchment is so impregnated with silk glue as to be useless.\r\n\r\nIf we examine some raw silk, taken from the middle layer of a cocoon,\r\nwe can easily see the two parallel fibres of silk and the outer\r\nwrinkled covering of silk glue. Now, magnifying our object more highly,\r\nwe shall see that each fibre is a solid rod, with a smooth lustrous\r\nsurface and without any sign of lumen or cell structure; the rods\r\ntoo are continuous and this alone distinguishes silk from all other\r\nfibres animal or vegetable. Two tests are worth trying for they are\r\ncharacteristic of silk. On the addition of a little strong sulphuric\r\nacid we observe that the silk rapidly dissolves, on the other hand, if\r\na few fibres are boiled in hydrochloric acid, the silk dissolves but\r\nthe envelope of silk glue remains unchanged and appears beneath the\r\nmicroscope as a cracked and wrinkled tube.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of another moth spins coarser greyish coloured fibres,\r\nwhich are spun into the well known Tussore silk. As with the common\r\nsilkworm these caterpillars spin two fibres and glue them together\r\nwith silk glue. In this case, however, under a high magnification we\r\nshall notice that the fibres are marked with a number of very fine\r\nlines running lengthways, whilst every now and then there are fairly\r\ndeep indentations. The former markings are natural to the fibres,\r\nthe latter are caused by one fibre being pressed against the other.\r\nIn countries where the production of silk is of great importance, the\r\nmicroscope is not only pressed into service for examining the product\r\nof these useful little insects, but also in keeping watch for a very\r\ndeadly disease which attacks the caterpillars. It is called “pebrine”\r\nand the great scientist Pasteur, whose name is world famous for his\r\nwork on bacteriology, discovered that it was caused by a tiny fungus.\r\n\r\nArtificial silk is an important article of commerce. It is made in\r\nseveral different ways and of various substances. Some artificial silk\r\nis made of collodion, some again is made of cellulose the substance\r\nof which the cell walls of young plants is composed; gelatine is also\r\nused in making this commodity. As a rule it is easy to distinguish\r\nartificial from real silk, for usually the imitation consists of flat\r\nfibres or at least fibres quite different to the smooth rods of real\r\nsilk. The iodine test is often sufficient indication, for with this\r\nchemical true silk is coloured brown.\r\n\r\nSpace or lack of it does not allow us to describe how the microscope\r\nmay be and is applied to other manufactures, even the miller uses the\r\ninstrument, for it will tell him if his flour is of pure wheat, and in\r\nthis manner. He puts a little flour in a drop of water on a slide and\r\ncovers with a cover slip; then, for a moment or two, he rubs the cover\r\nglass to and fro over the water and flour and examines his specimen\r\nunder the microscope. If his flour be of wheat, he will see fairly\r\nstout spindle shaped strings, if it be of rye no strings appear, whilst\r\nmaize flour gives very small strings. These are called gluten strings\r\nand wheat is very rich in gluten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE MICROSCOPE AND CAMERA ALLIED\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotography is such a popular hobby in these days, that the enthusiast\r\nwho possesses both camera and microscope, is certain, sooner or later,\r\nto wish to take permanent records of some of the beautiful objects\r\nrevealed to him by the latter instrument. The production of high-power\r\nphoto-micrographs, as the pictures of highly magnified objects are\r\ncalled, can only be carried out by those who are skilled in the use of\r\nboth camera and microscope and are possessed of considerable patience.\r\nThere is nothing to prevent any amateur photographer who possesses\r\na bellows camera--box cameras cannot be used for this work--from\r\nproducing excellent low-power photo-micrographs, that is to say\r\npictures of objects less highly magnified.\r\n\r\nIt may be disappointing to learn that a microscope is not necessary\r\nfor this work. The requirements are, a camera which will open out to\r\na considerable extent and a short focus lens. Before we show how the\r\npictures may be taken, we must be quite clear what is meant by a short\r\nfocus lens. There are various ways of measuring the focus of a lens; in\r\nthe case of a single lens the operation is fairly simple, but single\r\nlenses are made of one glass and most camera lenses are built up of\r\nseveral pieces of glass, then it is much more difficult to measure the\r\nfocus quite accurately. For ordinary purposes and for our purpose, it\r\nis only necessary to know the focus in round figures and to do so we\r\nopen up the camera and focus some distant object on the ground glass,\r\nthen the distance in inches from the back of the lens to the ground\r\nglass will give us very nearly the correct focus, or as it is often\r\ncalled focal length, of our lens. Suppose we focus on a church steeple\r\na mile away and then find that a space of five inches separates the\r\nback of our lens from the ground glass, the lens is of five inches\r\nfocal length.\r\n\r\nWith a lens of such a focal length we shall require a camera with\r\nvery long bellows to obtain much magnification of our object but, if\r\nour camera is one with only short bellows, we can still overcome our\r\ndifficulties. If the extra expense is no object we can obtain one of\r\nthe excellent Aldis lenses of only two inches focal length, especially\r\ndesigned for this work; if we are ingenious we can construct a device\r\nwhich will answer our purpose admirably and cost but a few pence. With\r\nthe simple apparatus we are about to describe photo-micrographs up to\r\nten diameters magnification can be obtained in most cameras. The term,\r\nten diameters, may appear puzzling but really it is quite simple.\r\nSuppose we wish to make a photo-micrograph of a penny stamp and we wish\r\nit to be magnified ten diameters, we should require a large camera\r\nfor the operation, but that, for the moment, is beside the point. Our\r\npenny stamp, magnified ten diameters, would be equal in area to ten\r\nhorizontal rows of stamps, each row containing ten stamps or, in other\r\nwords, it would occupy the same area as one hundred penny stamps.\r\n\r\nTo find the magnification possible with our camera and lens, extend\r\nthe camera bellows to the full and set up a foot rule in front of the\r\nlens. Move the camera from a distance slowly towards the rule till it\r\nis sharply focussed, then carefully measure the distance between the\r\ninch lines on the focussing screen; if the lines are three inches apart\r\nwe shall be able to make photo-micrographs three times the size of our\r\nobject and we shall probably desire something better.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a considerably magnified picture we must have a lens of short\r\nfocal length and a camera with long bellows, in fact in theory the\r\namount of magnification is only limited by the length of the bellows,\r\nso that an extraordinarily long camera should give us a much magnified\r\npicture. We cannot lengthen our bellows without considerable expense,\r\nbut we can shorten the focal length of our lens. If we obtain, at the\r\ncost of a few pence, a convex lens of short focal length, such as is\r\nused in cheap magnifiers we can easily apply it to our camera lens\r\nand it will have the effect of shortening its focus. This extra lens\r\ncan either be fitted in front of our original lens by cutting two\r\ninches of cardboard, of such a size that they will just fit into the\r\nlens hood. In the centre of each piece of cardboard, cut two circles,\r\nslightly smaller in diameter than the diameter of the convex lens.\r\nPlace the lens over the opening in one of the pieces of cardboard and\r\nstick the other piece upon it with glue or seccotine. When dry fix the\r\nlens in its cardboard holder in the front of the lens hood and repeat\r\nthe focussing experiment with the foot rule. We shall now obtain a much\r\ngreater magnification with the same length of bellows, because the\r\nadditional lens has shortened the focus of our original lens. Probably\r\nour camera is fitted with a double lens and it is possible to unscrew\r\nthe front portion, in this event our extra lens with its cardboard\r\nholder may be fitted inside the front lens up against the diaphragm and\r\nthe front lens replaced. The result is practically the same whatever\r\nthe position of the new lens, but we must be certain that it is convex,\r\nfor a concave lens would increase the focal length of the whole and so\r\nreduce our magnification.\r\n\r\nWe may find that the amount of enlargement we can now obtain is\r\nsufficient for our purpose; if so we can go ahead and produce\r\nphoto-micrographs of all the objects we desire. The methods of doing so\r\ndiffer in no way from those employed in taking ordinary photographs and\r\nas we are writing about microscopy and not photography in these pages,\r\nthere is no need to go into further details. Even the experienced\r\nphotographer, however, is liable to overlook one or two important\r\ndetails. The bugbear in all work of this kind, with low magnifications\r\nas well as high, is vibration. Not only is our object magnified but\r\nevery movement is equally increased. No one should walk across the\r\nroom while this work is in progress; in large towns, trams and heavy\r\nmotors will ruin many a plate, in fact it is only when one takes up\r\nwork of this kind that one realises that one’s house is in a perpetual\r\nquiver. Some enthusiasts work at the dead of night, others suspend\r\ntheir apparatus on springs and invent all kinds of ingenious devices to\r\novercome these miniature earthquakes.\r\n\r\nIf time is no object, we have an easy means of still further increasing\r\nthe magnification. To do so we cut a thin sheet of copper in such a\r\nmanner that it just fits our lens tube, in front of the diaphragm. Then\r\nin the very centre of the copper disc we make a hole with a “number\r\none” needle, the hole is about one twentieth of an inch in diameter.\r\nReplace the convex lens in its cardboard holder and screw on the front\r\nportion of the camera lens. A trial will show that we have considerably\r\nincreased the magnification but decreased the amount of light admitted\r\nby the lens, therefore we shall probably require an exposure as long as\r\nan hour. How about the bugbear vibration during such a long exposure\r\nis a natural question to ask. Unless the vibration is continuous, and\r\nthat is unlikely, it is less likely to cause trouble during a very long\r\nexposure than during a short one, because it operates during a small\r\nproportion of the whole time.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of objects can be depicted with the apparatus we have\r\ndescribed. Minute shells and insects; parts of larger insects, their\r\nlegs and wings for example; the feathers of birds; various rocks,\r\ncrystals of all kinds; small flowers and their seeds; mosses, lichens\r\nand many kinds of fungus, in fact their number is limited only by the\r\ndegree of ingenuity possessed by the photographer. Do not suppose\r\nthat these low-power photo-micrographs are interesting only because\r\nof their size, the enthusiast who makes a collection will discover\r\nin his prints hidden beauty of which he had no conception when he\r\nlooked at the originals. We have seen a very large number of low-power\r\nphoto-micrographs, taken with very inexpensive apparatus, showing\r\nthe wonderful sculpturing on the wing cases of beetles, some of them\r\nare marvels of design, yet, observed with the naked eye, many of the\r\ninsects appear to be devoid of ornamentation.\r\n\r\nThe production of high-power photo-micrographs is hardly a subject that\r\ncan be described in these pages; the apparatus is costly for, even if\r\none dispenses with a specially designed micro-photographic camera, it\r\nis necessary to have a good microscope and bellows camera, for really\r\nadvanced work. Messrs Swift & Sons supply an excellent fitting, with\r\nwhich quite satisfactory photo-micrographs may be taken. It consists of\r\na light metal cone, the more pointed end fits over the upper portion\r\nof the microscope tube; the other end of the cone is provided with\r\nground and plain glass focussing screens and a dark slide. When using\r\nthis apparatus, it is first necessary to find and focus our object in\r\nthe ordinary way, before attaching the photographic apparatus. Having\r\nsecured our object exactly as we wish it to be depicted and well in\r\nthe centre of the illuminated circle, we remove the eyepiece and slip\r\nthe metal camera over the top of the microscope tube. If now we place\r\nthe ground glass screen in position, we can see an image of our object\r\nupon it. Great attention must be paid to the lighting, it is necessary\r\nthat the illumination be perfectly even, otherwise our negative will be\r\nover-exposed in some parts and under-exposed in others. When everything\r\nis in order the plain glass screen is substituted for the one of ground\r\nglass. On this we shall probably not see any image with the naked eye,\r\nbut with the help of a magnifying glass we can see a much finer image\r\nthan was possible on the ground glass screen. The final focussing is\r\ndone at this stage and, having secured as sharp an image as possible,\r\nthe focussing screen is removed and the exposure is made. Experience\r\nalone will teach the length of exposure, it depends upon the amount\r\nand nature of the light, upon the transparency of the object and\r\nalso upon its colour. There is no more simple apparatus for taking\r\nmoderately high-power photo-micrographs; for more advanced work the\r\nmicro-telescope and the super-microscope (see Chapter XVII) used with a\r\ncamera, will enable the user to obtain pictures of objects magnified as\r\nmuch as five thousand times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nHOW THE GLASS USED IN MICROSCOPES IS MADE\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving described all the ordinary uses of the microscope and having\r\nalso insisted that the objectives are the most important part of the\r\ninstrument, there are probably many of our readers who may wish to know\r\nin what manner this wonderful glass differs from ordinary glass and how\r\nit is made.\r\n\r\nGlass has been defined as a substance which, during its manufacture,\r\npasses from the liquid to the solid state so rapidly that no crystals\r\nare formed. Usually when solids are melted and then allowed to cool,\r\nthey do so with the formation of crystals, this may be shown in the\r\ncase of sulphur by melting a little and then allowing it to cool. After\r\na while, as cooling takes place a solid crust will be formed on the\r\nsurface of the molten sulphur. If two holes are pierced in the crust\r\nand the still liquid sulphur poured out, it will be found that the\r\nsulphur which adhered to the vessel in which the melting took place has\r\nformed beautiful needle shaped crystals.\r\n\r\nA great amount of original work has been done on the subject of glass\r\nmanufacture and especially on the kind used for optical instruments--as\r\na result there are many kinds of glass differing from one another in\r\nphysical properties and in chemical composition. Although the various\r\nchemicals used and their proportions are fairly well standardised,\r\nas the result of long experience, it is probable that glass is not\r\na definite chemical compound but a mixture, in which certain of the\r\ncomponents act as solvents for the rest.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary glass in use in this country, apart from specially\r\nprepared optical glass, may be either English flint glass, plate\r\nglass or Bohemian glass. The first named is composed of sand,\r\npotassium carbonate and red lead; plate glass is made of sand with the\r\ncarbonates of sodium and calcium, whilst similar ingredients are used\r\nfor Bohemian glass except that carbonate of potassium is substituted\r\nfor carbonate of sodium. It is chiefly owing to the requirements of\r\noptical instrument makers that, new kinds of glass containing very many\r\npreviously untried chemicals, have been produced. As a result glasses\r\nare now made with specific gravities varying from 2.5 to 5.0, that is\r\nto say the weight of a square inch, or a square foot or a square yard\r\nof glass may weigh anything from two and a half to five times more than\r\na square inch, foot or yard of water, according to its composition.\r\n\r\nBefore we describe the details of its manufacture let us consider its\r\nproperties as briefly as possible. At high temperatures it is perfectly\r\nfluid and may be poured from vessel to vessel as easily as water; at\r\nlower temperatures it is viscous, _i.e._, semi-fluid and can be rolled\r\nwith an iron roller as dough is rolled with a rolling pin; it can be\r\nmoulded into any desired shape, blown out into flasks and bottles or\r\ndrawn out into threads so fine that they may be woven into a fabric. It\r\nis a bad conductor of heat and for this reason it is safer to pour very\r\nhot liquids into a thin glass vessel than into a thick one. With thick\r\nglass the inner layers expand with the heat before the outer layers\r\nare even warm and the result is a crack or often absolute fracture.\r\nSometimes during manufacture glass vessels which are suddenly cooled\r\nwill appear satisfactory, but the particles of glass remain in so high\r\na state of tension that at the slightest touch the vessel will break up\r\ninto thousands of pieces. On account of this property of glass it must\r\nbe cooled very slowly indeed; the process is known as annealing.\r\n\r\nOptical glass unlike most other kinds must be manufactured in thick\r\nblocks--some of the large lenses on telescopes are of considerable\r\nthickness. All glass for scientific instruments must also be\r\nhomogeneous, which our dictionary tells us means of the same kind. To\r\nbe more explicit each particle of optical glass should be precisely the\r\nsame in composition and properties as every other particle. In the very\r\nearly days of manufacture it was difficult to obtain homogeneous pieces\r\nof glass and Guinard, in the 18th century, conceived the idea of\r\nstirring the molten glass with a rod of fireclay, to ensure a thorough\r\nmixing of the components. This led to considerable improvement and the\r\nmethod has survived to the present day.\r\n\r\nThe first real advance in the manufacture of optical glass, was due\r\nto the ingenuity of two Germans, Abbe and Schott, who lived at Jena.\r\nJena glass became famous for the manufacture of lenses, so much so that\r\na stupid idea still prevails in many quarters that only the Germans\r\ncan make good optical glass. To give them their due it is good but\r\nquite recent events have shown the world that the Britisher can make\r\nbetter. The two German scientists used new chemicals in making their\r\nglass and they succeeded in producing a substance which possessed\r\nhitherto unheard of properties. In what is now known as the older\r\ncrown and flint glass the dispersion and refraction increased with the\r\ndensity, that is to say, the heavier the glass the more it scatters\r\nand bends light rays passing through it. With the new methods, glass\r\nis made which scatters the light rays very little, though bending them\r\nconsiderably and vice versa. The ordinary crown glass is composed\r\nof silicates of calcium and sodium or of calcium and potassium or a\r\nmixture of both and it is possible to make it colourless and free from\r\ndefects, but its optical properties are never so valuable as those of\r\nJena glass. The most important components of the newer glass are the\r\noxides of Barium, Magnesium, Aluminium, Zinc and Boron.\r\n\r\nGood optical glass should be transparent and colourless and, as we have\r\nstated, it should be homogeneous--the refraction and dispersion of\r\nlight rays should be identical over all parts of the glass. It should\r\npossess no striæ, as they are called. Striæ may be seen at the edge of\r\na piece of plate glass as little lines just as though the glass had\r\nbeen formed in layers. Striæ detract from the efficiency of optical\r\nglass, nevertheless, some very cheap lenses are made of plate glass.\r\nBubbles are almost always present in Jena glass but, unless they are\r\nvery numerous they do not appear to render the glass less efficient.\r\nHardness and chemical stability are other desirable qualities. Most of\r\nthese high-grade glasses are soft, as shown by the ease with which they\r\nmay be scratched; many of them are not very stable chemically and are\r\neasily affected by chemical fumes with the result that their surfaces\r\nbecome covered with a coloured film. With all their drawbacks, for\r\noptical work the newer glasses far excel the older.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of optical glass is a costly and lengthy process.\r\nThe chemicals used in its manufacture are selected with the greatest\r\ncare; impurities must be guarded against for they would change the\r\ncomposition of the glass and in doing so alter its physical properties\r\non which everything depends. The chemical substances are used either\r\nin the form of oxides, nitrates or carbonates, for the reason that\r\nthey are easily decomposed by heat. To assist in the melting of the\r\nsubstances a few fragments of glass of similar composition are added.\r\nThe crucibles, in which the chemical components are melted, are covered\r\nso that no fumes from the furnace may gain access to them, even the\r\nchemical composition of the crucibles is carefully tested that no\r\nimpurities may contaminate the glass. No crucible is ever used more\r\nthan once and only a single crucible is heated in each furnace, in\r\norder that the temperature may be regulated to a nicety.\r\n\r\nThe actual manufacture is then begun after all these preliminaries have\r\nbeen attended to. A clean dry crucible is heated in a furnace--not the\r\none in which the glass making is to take place--to a dull red heat.\r\nThen, with iron tongs, it is removed to the previously heated glass\r\nmaking furnace and the temperature is raised very gradually. The next\r\nstage sees the addition of the well mixed chemicals to the heated\r\ncrucible, in small quantities at a time. When the full quantity has\r\nbeen added the crucible contains melted glass full of bubbles, some of\r\nthem air bubbles released from the raw materials as they were added\r\nand some bubbles of gas given off from the chemicals as they act upon\r\none another. The molten glass is then heated strongly so that it will\r\nbecome perfectly liquid and many of the bubbles will be driven off. To\r\nreach this stage may occupy anything from thirty-six to sixty hours and\r\nconstant attention is necessary during the whole time.\r\n\r\nThe next stage is perhaps the most important in the whole process.\r\nAfter numerous small samples of the molten glass have been taken, on\r\nthe end of iron rods, to see if the air bubbles have been driven off,\r\nthe mixture is stirred to render it homogeneous and to eradicate striæ.\r\nThe stirring is carried out by means of a cylinder of fireclay which is\r\nfirst of all heated to the temperature of the molten glass before it is\r\nintroduced. To the end of the fireclay cylinder a long, detachable iron\r\nhandle is fixed so that the man who undertakes the stirring may stand\r\nat a distance from the hot furnace. The heat is great and the work of\r\nstirring is laborious and for this reason the stirrers are constantly\r\nchanged. The iron handles must be watched carefully for, owing to the\r\nheat they rust rapidly and should any of the rust fall into the molten\r\nglass it would impart to it a colour and render it useless for optical\r\npurposes. When stirring begins the glass is liquid as water, but the\r\nstirring is continued during cooling and all the while the glass is\r\ngradually becoming more and more solid. During the final stages the\r\noperation is hard labour indeed and, finally, it is not possible to\r\nstir any more, then the fireclay cylinder is either removed or left in\r\nthe glass.\r\n\r\nWhen the glass has solidified and, whilst it is still hot the furnace\r\nis sealed and allowed to cool very gradually till it has reached the\r\nordinary temperature of its surroundings; this may take several weeks.\r\nWhen quite cool, the crucible is removed from the furnace and carefully\r\nbroken; then the glass, which may be in one mass weighing as much as\r\n1000 lbs., is freed from particles of fireclay and examined for defects.\r\n\r\nThe next stage consists of moulding and annealing. Large pieces of\r\nglass are heated till they are just soft, then they are passed into\r\niron or fireclay moulds designed so that the glass is formed into discs\r\nor slabs suitable for grinding by opticians. They are allowed to cool\r\nvery slowly in the moulds.\r\n\r\nWhen the glass is taken from the moulds it is not yet ready to be made\r\ninto lenses. It is subjected to another and very careful examination,\r\nwhen all defective parts are cut out. Should there be many defects the\r\nglass is again heated, moulded and annealed. From a crucible containing\r\n1000 lbs. of molten glass it is unusual to obtain much more than 200\r\nlbs. of optically perfect glass, it is obvious therefore that lenses\r\ncannot be cheap.\r\n\r\nOne would naturally imagine that the minute lenses used in microscope\r\nobjectives should be cheaper in comparison than the larger lenses used\r\nfor photography or in telescopes, for it is always more difficult\r\nto make minute articles than large ones. As a matter of fact, even\r\nallowing for the greater amount of material used in the larger lenses,\r\nquality being the same in both cases, they are far more expensive\r\nthan the smaller microscope lenses; the reason being that it is\r\nexceedingly difficult to obtain a perfect specimen of large size. The\r\ndifficulty arises not only in the actual manufacture of the glass but\r\nin the subsequent operations of cutting, grinding and polishing when\r\nfractures are very liable to occur.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief account of the manufacture of optical glass it is clear\r\nthat a good lens is always worth a high price. Its components must be\r\nof the purest quality obtainable, the process of manufacture requires\r\nhighly skilled labour and it is laborious and exacting work. Constant\r\nattention is needed from start to finish and much of the glass is never\r\nsufficiently good to pass the rigorous tests which it must undergo.\r\nLastly, in the final preparations of the completed lens, mishaps are\r\nfrequent. Added to all these trials of the lens maker is the one\r\noutstanding fact that the process can never be hurried at any stage,\r\nthe efficient annealing of optical glass is one of the most important\r\nstages in its manufacture. A very full account of the manufacture of\r\noptical glass is given in the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, whence much of\r\nour information in this chapter is derived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE CHOICE AND USE OF APPARATUS AND ACCESSORIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this, our concluding chapter, we propose to give a few hints upon\r\nthe choice and use of the microscope and its accessories, to enlighten\r\nour readers concerning stains and staining and to add such other\r\ninformation as is likely to be useful, information which is better\r\nsupplied in a chapter of its own than scattered about our pages and\r\nprobably overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe most important question concerns the choice of a microscope. In\r\na book of this nature it is obviously impossible to recommend the\r\nwares of any one maker. Some firms are celebrated for the good wearing\r\nqualities of their instruments, some for the delicacy--not fragility by\r\nthe way--of their fine adjustments and our readers must select their\r\nmaker for themselves. One thing we strongly advise, be patriotic and\r\nselect a British maker, it is not only a question of patriotism but of\r\nself interest, for in many respects the British instruments lead the\r\nworld. Most of the manufacturers advertise in such papers as _Nature_,\r\nthey all print excellent catalogues, a perusal of which may be a useful\r\npreliminary.\r\n\r\nThe instrument we select will depend on the use to which we intend to\r\nput it and on the length of our purse. Perhaps the question of cost\r\nwill be more important to most people. An elaborate instrument is not\r\na desirable acquisition, till we are somewhat advanced in our work\r\nat anyrate, and one of the models which most makers call Students’\r\nMicroscopes will do everything we desire. We should have at least two\r\nobjectives, three if we can afford them, a 1 inch and a 1/6 inch will\r\nenable us to examine everything described in these pages, except some\r\nof the bacteria. If we wish to add a third objective we might select\r\na 2 inch one, for quite low-power work and later we shall probably\r\nbecome the proud possessors of a 1/12 inch objective, but this would be\r\nof little use to us at first. Two eyepieces will complete our optical\r\nequipment. A condenser for the stage, properly known as a substage\r\ncondenser is an addition which we shall appreciate, though quite\r\ninteresting work may be done without it.\r\n\r\nOur other apparatus is inexpensive and comprises, one or two dissecting\r\nknives, some needles mounted in handles, a pair of fine scissors, a\r\npair of small forceps, a razor, one or two camel hair brushes, three\r\nor four watch glasses, slides and cover slips, and a pipette or two. A\r\npipette, by the way, is merely a glass tube pointed at one end and cut\r\noff square at the other; at about its centre it is much wider than at\r\nthe top or bottom. It is a most useful piece of apparatus for picking\r\nup small water animals which we wish to examine. By putting the pointed\r\nend of the pipette just over an _Amœba_, for example, and sucking\r\ngently at the other end, we shall draw some water and the animal into\r\nthe swollen part of the tube. If we then place one finger over the end\r\nof the pipette to which we have applied suction we can transfer the\r\ncontents wherever we wish without it running out, as soon as we remove\r\nour finger the pipette empties itself. The dissecting knives are useful\r\nfor cutting up specimens before examination, the mounted needles for\r\nteasing them, that is to say tearing them into fine shreds. The brushes\r\nwe may use instead of the pipette, for picking up small objects from\r\nwater, or when dry. The watch glasses are useful for examining objects\r\nsuch as sponges, water fleas, etc., under water. They are just as\r\nsatisfactory for most purposes as the specially constructed zoophyte\r\ntroughs and, of course, very much cheaper. The razor is required for\r\nsection cutting concerning which we will say a few words.\r\n\r\nFor section cutting, special razors are sold, they are heavy as a rule\r\nand not hollow ground. Many microscopists aver that good sections\r\ncannot be cut with a hollow ground razor, we beg to differ, however.\r\nOn this point we would advise our readers to select whichever pattern\r\nsuits them best; there is no need to buy an expensive razor, for our\r\nearly efforts, at anyrate, will quickly dull the cutting edge and\r\nthere is no advantage in going to much expense in this direction.\r\n\r\nTo cut really good sections is not difficult, it is a question of knack\r\nrather than skill; having once acquired the knack, practice will do the\r\nrest. The great point is to begin properly, some people never take the\r\nnecessary trouble in their early days and, as a consequence, they never\r\nlearn to cut good sections.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing mysterious about the operation, a section is merely a\r\nvery thin slice. A good section for examination under the microscope\r\nshould, of course, be so thin that it is transparent; it should be\r\nequally thin everywhere, not thick in some places and thin in others\r\nand it should be cut in the proper direction. The last statement\r\nrequires a little explanation; suppose we wish to make a section\r\nstraight across a stem, a transverse section it would be called, then\r\nwe must see to it that our section is cut straight across, and not in\r\nsuch a manner that the portion from which the section is cut tapers\r\nin the slightest degree. Before we begin the actual section cutting\r\nwe must always trim up our specimen with one of the dissecting knives\r\nand not attempt to make the surface level with the razor. As a start,\r\nlet us take some moderately fleshy plant stem for we shall find it as\r\neasy to cut as anything. Our stem must not be woody, for till we have\r\nhad a fair amount of practice we shall damage our razor on its hard\r\nstructures; it must not be too soft or it will be crushed out of all\r\nrecognition in our fingers; it should not be hollow, for solid stems\r\nare always easier to cut. Having selected our stem and the spot upon it\r\nat which we require a section, we cut straight across it at that spot\r\nwith our dissecting knife, in such a manner that the cut edge is as\r\nnearly as possible at right angles to the sides of the stem. A piece\r\ntwo or three inches long is the most comfortable to hold.\r\n\r\nHolding our razor firmly in the right hand we take our specimen in the\r\nthumb and index finger of the left hand. Place the side of the stem\r\nagainst the first joint of the index finger and slightly bend the tip\r\nof the finger round the object. The end of the stem, from which we\r\npropose to cut our section, should be slightly above the level of the\r\nindex finger. With the thumb, the stem is pressed firmly against the\r\nfirst joint of the index finger and the first joint of the thumb must\r\nnot be bent upwards. This last point is very important, as we shall\r\nsee in a moment. From our description the method of holding the stem\r\nmay seem somewhat cramped; it should not be so, however, and an easy\r\nposition will help towards success but let it be the correct position.\r\nWe may play the violin, in a manner, without learning the correct\r\nmethod of bowing but we can never become expert violinists unless we\r\nhold our bow properly, in the same way we can never cut really fine\r\nsections unless we hold our specimen in the correct way. We now lay our\r\nrazor along the second joint of the index finger in such a manner that\r\nthe heel of the razor, or a point near the heel comes gainst the end of\r\nthe stem. For the first time we realize the importance of holding our\r\nspecimen correctly, for the index finger forms a convenient platform\r\non which to steady the razor. To cut our section, we, of course, press\r\nthe razor towards us and, at the same time draw it outwards from heel\r\nto toe. We must never attempt to press the razor straight through the\r\nspecimen, however soft the latter may be, we must always draw the razor\r\nalong, at the same time as we press it through the specimen. Never cut\r\noutwards as in sharpening a pencil and never move the razor backwards\r\nand forwards as though using a saw. The outward cut will never result\r\nin a good section, a sawing movement will give a section alternately\r\nthick and thin. Should the section be somewhat tough we may find the\r\nrazor slip suddenly over its surface, an event which will impress\r\nitself upon us painfully if we have forgotten the injunction not to\r\nbend the thumb, for the certain result of the slip will be the loss of\r\na goodly portion of skin upon one’s joint. A straight thumb will be out\r\nof the danger zone of a slipping razor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _By the courtesy of Messrs. F. Davidson & Co._\r\n\r\n  1.

IMAGES SEEN BY A FLY\r\n\r\n    Photographs of a statue taken through a fly’s eye. Instead of\r\n    seeing one image of an object, the fly sees as many images as there\r\n    are lenses in its eyes.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nHaving cut a section it is hardly likely that, at this our first\r\nattempt, it will be good enough to put under the microscope, so we\r\nwill continue to cut section after section till we have a dozen or\r\nmore from these we can select the most transparent for examination.\r\nThe sections of such material as a stem should be kept moist and\r\nto do so we will place them in a watch glass containing water. It is\r\noften easier, also, to cut our sections if the razor be moistened with\r\nwater, at anyrate the moisture prevents the sections from adhering to\r\nthe razor. The sections should be removed from razor to watch glass\r\nand from watch glass to slide, by means of a brush, never by means of\r\nthe fingers. The razor of course, should be well dried with a soft rag\r\nbefore it is put away; rust, besides being unsightly, ruins the cutting\r\nedge. If we are really anxious to cut our own sections, and every good\r\nmicroscopist does so, we shall return to the operation again and again,\r\neven cutting objects which we have no desire to examine, for the sake\r\nof the practice. We shall soon reach a stage where our razor will be\r\ndulled and require stropping and the efficient stropping of a razor is,\r\nto many people, a more difficult operation than the cutting of sections.\r\n\r\nWe may point out here, that all sections are not quite so easy to cut\r\nas the one we have taken as our example. Some objects are so soft that\r\nthey need hardening with chemicals before they can be cut, some are\r\nso hard that to attempt to cut them would ruin the edge of the razor,\r\nthough it is wonderful what hard substances may be cut when we have\r\nhad a little experience; some are so delicate that they must needs be\r\nburied in melted wax, then object and wax are cut together and later\r\nthe wax is separated from the section.\r\n\r\nLeaves and very small stems may be sectioned by the beginner, as\r\neasily as larger stems. For such objects little sticks of pith are\r\nsold as holders. Having cut of our piece of leaf from which we wish to\r\nderive a section, we make a slit, with our dissecting knife, down the\r\nmiddle of one end of a piece of pith. The piece of leaf is then placed\r\nin the slit and by holding the pith at the sides our piece of leaf is\r\nheld firmly. Sections are cut through pith and leaf, and the two are\r\nfloated in water, when the thin slices of pith will float away from the\r\nleaf sections.\r\n\r\nHaving cut a satisfactory section, let us proceed to describe the\r\nmethod of making a slide thereof. We will suppose that we do not\r\nwish to make a permanent preparation but one for temporary use. A\r\nclean slide must be selected, all through our pages we emphasise the\r\ncleanliness of slides, at or near its centre we put a drop of water\r\nand, lifting it with a brush, we place our section in the drop of\r\nwater. If our examination is to be with a low magnification, we need\r\nnot use a cover slip, nevertheless it is worth while to cultivate the\r\nhabit of using one. The cover slip is not only a protection for our\r\nobject but for our objective. Water you may argue cannot harm the\r\nlenses of the objective. Perhaps not, we will not argue the point but,\r\nwhen the water dries on the objective, it leaves a certain amount of\r\ndeposit on the glass and this deposit must be rubbed off. The less\r\noften the lenses are rubbed the better for them, glass especially very\r\nhighly polished optical glass, is far more easily scratched than many\r\npeople imagine and a scratched lens is an inefficient lens. When using\r\nhigh magnifications a cover glass should always cover our object and\r\nthe same remark applies to objects examined in Canada Balsam. This\r\nsubstance is likely to cause serious trouble if it finds its way on to\r\nan objective. It must be removed, that is obvious, but it sets hard,\r\nit must not be scraped away for fear of damaging the optical glass\r\nand, as it is used to cement the lenses together, there is the great\r\ndanger that any solvent used to remove the Balsam from the face of the\r\nobjectives, may also dissolve their setting. Our digression may seem\r\nsomewhat unnecessary, but the very great importance of keeping all\r\nchemicals and even water, from coming into contact with the lenses of\r\nour instrument cannot be insisted upon too strongly.\r\n\r\nIn whatever substance we examine our object, water, glycerine or\r\nBalsam, there is a right and a wrong way of applying the cover slip. It\r\nmust not be dropped or laid down flat upon the object, if we do this\r\nwe shall certainly imprison a number of air bubbles and that must be\r\navoided. One edge of the cover slip must be laid against the edge of\r\nthe mountant, as the liquid used for mounting our object is called,\r\nthen placing a needle beneath the cover slip it must be gently lowered\r\ninto position. We shall now find that all air bubbles are driven out as\r\nthe cover slip is lowered.\r\n\r\nWhen we have cut an exceptionally good section or when we have some\r\nspecially interesting object we may wish to make a permanent slide.\r\nThe exact method of doing so varies somewhat with the nature of our\r\nobject and to describe all the methods of mounting microscopic objects\r\npermanently would require a book in itself. We will suppose that we\r\nwish to make a permanent slide of one of the sections floating in\r\nour watch glass of water. The first thing we must do is to get rid\r\nof the water with which our section by now is saturated. This may be\r\naccomplished by means of alcohol of various strengths, which we may\r\nput into three watch glasses. In the first watch glass we have half\r\npure alcohol and half water; in the second three-quarters alcohol and\r\none part water; in the third watch glass pure or absolute alcohol. The\r\nsection is transferred on a brush to the first watch glass and left\r\nthere for five minutes, then to the second watch glass for a similar\r\ntime and finally to the third watch glass. The mountant may be either\r\nCanada Balsam or glycerine jelly. Should we decide on Canada Balsam,\r\nwe put a small drop of the substance in the centre of a clean slide,\r\nplace one section atop of it and then gently lower a cover slip upon\r\nit as already described. Then, without using any force, the cover slip\r\nis pressed down, but we must not fall into the all too common error of\r\nthinking that a thick section can be made thin by pressing upon the\r\ncover slip. If we have taken the correct amount of Canada Balsam it\r\nwill just cover the area below the cover slip and no more, if we have\r\nused too much, it will flow out on all sides and perhaps on the top of\r\nthe cover slip. A very little experience will teach how big a drop of\r\nBalsam to use.\r\n\r\nShould we decide to use glycerine jelly, we take a small globule of\r\nthe jelly on one of our mounted needles and place it in the centre of\r\na clean slide. Then we hold the slide a little above a lighted candle,\r\nor even a match will do, to melt the jelly. Directly it is melted\r\nthe section is placed upon it, and we proceed as before. Whichever\r\nmountant we have used, the slides must be put away out of the dust, and\r\nthey must be flat and not placed on edge. In a few days the mountant\r\nwill set, and we need take no further precautions with the slides in\r\nwhich Balsam was used, but those mounted in glycerine jelly must be\r\nringed, for the reason that glycerine absorbs moisture from the air and\r\ngradually liquifies.\r\n\r\nThe process of ringing is best performed upon a turntable, which any\r\ndealer in microscope accessories will supply. It consists of a circular\r\nbrass plate which revolves about its centre and to which the slide to\r\nbe ringed is affixed. A bottle of ringing asphalt and a fine paint\r\nbrush are essentials. With a little of the asphalt upon our brush, we\r\nrevolve the turntable and place the brush against the edge of the cover\r\nslip as it revolves, in such a manner that we paint a narrow rim of\r\nasphalt over the junction of cover slip and slide. The asphalt prevents\r\nmoisture from reaching the glycerine jelly. Of course we may ring our\r\nslides without making use of a turntable, but it is not easy to paint\r\na neat ring without mechanical assistance. For square cover slips it\r\nis obvious that a turntable is useless. Specimens mounted in Canada\r\nBalsam do not need ringing, for the Balsam is unaffected by air or the\r\nmoisture therein, when once it has set hard.\r\n\r\nSeveral firms supply prepared microscope slides, and it is often\r\nuseful to know where reliable preparations may be obtained. The\r\nslides supplied by Messrs Flatters & Garnett Ltd., 409 Oxford Road,\r\nManchester, are models of what well-made slides should be.\r\n\r\nIt always lends greater interest to the hobby if objects are found and\r\nmounted by the microscopist himself. By going out into the fields, by\r\nthe pond-side, or along the shore, in search of interesting material\r\nfor examination, much will be learned of animal and plant habits which\r\neven the microscope cannot reveal. Some of us, however, have neither\r\nthe opportunity to hunt for our specimens, nor the time to mount them\r\nproperly, and those of us who are so situated will be glad to know\r\nwhere objects may be obtained.\r\n\r\nApparatus, useful for students of pond or sea-shore life, may be\r\nobtained from Messrs Flatters & Garnett, who always have a goodly stock\r\nof collecting jars, nets, &c. From the same firm, also, may be obtained\r\nstains and any of the limited number of chemicals required by the\r\nmicroscopist.\r\n\r\nWe have given a few simple directions for staining in our chapter on\r\nBacteria. In many cases it is absolutely necessary to have recourse to\r\nstains in order to see the structure of the objects we are desirous of\r\nexamining; in other cases it is necessary to stain when we wish to know\r\nthe nature of the various parts of our object. Suppose, for example, we\r\nwish to find out whether a plant section contains starch, we then add\r\niodine solution, and if any parts stain deep blue we know at once that\r\nstarch is present. There are other stains for other plant and animal\r\nsubstances; stains for woody matter, stains for fats, &c., but the art\r\nof staining is a science in itself, and would require many chapters\r\nto describe fully. Most of the objects described in this book can be\r\nstudied in the natural state, but, even so, they may be rendered far\r\nmore beautiful by staining.\r\n\r\nThe method we described for the staining of bacteria does not apply to\r\nsuch objects as plant sections, &c., and we propose to describe, as\r\nbriefly as possible, how to proceed with such objects. Suppose we are\r\nexamining one of the common pond plants, _Spirogyra_ for instance, and\r\nwe wish to see whether it contains starch. Our specimen is in a slide,\r\nin a drop of water, and covered by a cover slip. In the first place, we\r\nmust obtain some fluffless blotting paper--the ordinary filter papers\r\nsold by all chemists are excellent--from it we must cut about half a\r\ndozen pieces, about half an inch by one inch, the exact size is not\r\nimportant, and they need not be measured. These we must fold in the\r\ncentre, so that they can be made to stand up like an inverted V. From\r\nour bottle of iodine solution we take a drop of the liquid on the end\r\nof a glass rod and place it carefully at one edge of the cover slip,\r\navoiding allowing any of the solution to flow on to the upper surface\r\nof the slip. Now, one of the pieces of blotting paper must be placed\r\nupon the opposite side of the slide so that it will stand up; it must\r\nthen be moved till it just touches the edge of the cover slip. The\r\nblotting paper will absorb the water from beneath the cover slip, and\r\nin doing so the iodine solution will be drawn along to take the place\r\nof the water. By proceeding in this manner and replacing the blotting\r\npaper with a new piece as it becomes moist, also replenishing the drop\r\nof iodine as it is used up, we act upon our object with a stronger and\r\nstronger solution, and, in _Spirogyra_, the object which we took as our\r\nexample, we can see beautiful rosettes of starch grains, arranged at\r\nregular intervals along the green bands of chlorophyll. This method of\r\nstaining may be used in most cases where we merely require a temporary\r\nstain; by reversing the process and drawing water over the object by\r\nmeans of blotting paper, it may be used in washing sections and parts\r\nof plants. For very small objects, such as starch grains separated from\r\nthe plants in which they are formed, the method is hardly suitable, for\r\nthey are liable to be drawn along in the stream of liquid and lost.\r\n\r\nFor more permanent staining processes, we must use our watch glasses,\r\ninto which we pour the various liquids necessary for the operation. The\r\nprecise methods of staining, the periods during which objects should\r\nremain in the staining solution, and the chemicals used for removing\r\nexcessive stain vary, as may be guessed, according to circumstances.\r\nSome chemicals act very quickly, and staining takes place in a few\r\nminutes; others act slowly, and with them it is necessary to subject\r\nour specimens to their action for hours or even days. Then again, it is\r\nobvious that large specimens take longer to stain than small ones, hard\r\nobjects are not so readily acted upon as soft ones. Experience alone\r\nwill show what is required in various cases.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for example, we desire to stain a section in Carmalum, a\r\nmixture of Carminic Acid 1 grain, Alum 10 grains, hot distilled water\r\n200 c.c. We take three watch glasses, in one we place a few drops of\r\nour stain, in another water, and in the third alcohol. Our section is\r\nplaced in the watch glass containing the carmalum and is left there\r\nfor about two minutes, then with the help of a small brush it is\r\ntransferred for a similar period to the watch glass containing water,\r\nand finally it is placed in the alcohol. From the last watch glass it\r\nmay be transferred to glycerine jelly on a slide and mounted as already\r\ndescribed; Carmalum stains our section a beautiful pink.\r\n\r\nThere is a temptation to buy a large stock of stains of all hues and\r\nof varied composition. The temptation should not be allowed to get the\r\nbetter of us. In our early days at anyrate, we shall do far better if\r\nwe use but few stains and learn to understand their peculiarities.\r\n\r\nThe most useful selection for the beginner will comprise Haematoxylin,\r\nSafranin, Eosin, Carbol-Fuchsin, Methylene Blue, and Carmalum. These\r\nshould all be obtained ready for use: this will save errors in\r\ncompounding, and, in certain cases, will save time; some of the stains,\r\nHaematoxylin for example, are not fit for use till months after they\r\nhave been mixed with the other ingredients which form the complete\r\nstain.\r\n\r\nFrequently when examining small but lively water animals we may\r\nfeel the necessity of some method of sobering them. All the little\r\norganisms, both plants and animals, which are provided with the little\r\nwhip-like structures mentioned so often in our pages, are difficult to\r\nexamine whilst they are in motion. There are many substances, we might\r\nadd, which would kill them, but in doing so we shall nearly always find\r\nthat they contract to such an extent as to lose all semblance of their\r\nnatural shape, and become useless as objects for our microscope. Should\r\nour inclinations lead us in the direction of much study of these little\r\nbeings, we shall do well to keep handy a small bottle of Rousselet’s\r\nsolution; it is composed of 2 per cent. solution of hydrochlorate\r\nof cocaine, 3 parts; Methylated Spirit, 1 part; water, 6 parts. Any\r\nchemist will mix the solution for us. When we have occasion to examine\r\na too lively specimen, we simply run a drop of the solution under the\r\ncover slip, as described in our remarks on staining with iodine, and\r\nthe creature we are examining will abandon its frolics and conveniently\r\nremain in a fully expanded state.\r\n\r\nMany of our readers will be anxious to carry their microscopic\r\ninvestigations to a more advanced stage than we have reached in our\r\npages. Some will have the advantage of a teacher, and it is a great\r\nadvantage to have someone who can show rather than merely explain what\r\nshould be done; others not so well placed may like to know a few really\r\nuseful books which will help them in their work. “The Microscope and\r\nits Revelations,” by B. H. Dallinger, is a large and therefore costly\r\nwork, but it contains a rare fund of information for the microscopist.\r\nSmaller and eminently suitable for the general worker is “Modern\r\nMicroscopy,” by Messrs Cross & Cole. Those who wish to specialize in\r\none of the sciences, such as Botany, Zoology, or Geology, will find no\r\nlack of books dealing with the subject that most appeals to them. For\r\nphotographers who are also microscopists, we know of no better books\r\nthan “Practical Principles of Plain Photomicrography,” by G. West, or\r\nthe more advanced “Handbook of Photomicrography,” by Messrs Hind &\r\nRandles.\r\n\r\nNeither books nor teacher will be able to reveal to any of us all the\r\nsecrets of the microscope. By its means a new world is unfolded before\r\nthe eyes of mankind, a world of unlimited possibilities. No man will\r\never see all that the microscope can show him, each day some fresh\r\nwonder is looked upon for the first time.\r\n\r\nAs a hobby, microscopy can hardly be excelled. It is a sensible hobby\r\nand, after the initial outlay, need cost us but a few pence each year.\r\nWe hear someone say that he prefers an outdoor hobby, but surely the\r\nmicroscope, if used intelligently, will take us out of doors. The\r\nsearch for specimens is one of the attractions of microscopy. As an\r\ninstrument for the serious worker the microscope compares favourably\r\nwith any other invention of mankind.\r\n\r\nThink for a moment what we owe to the microscope in a hundred and one\r\nwalks of life, and then you will realize the romance attached to the\r\ninstrument, and its revelations from the days of Euclid to the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n

Each volume is complete in itself, and no knowledge\r\n  of the previous volumes is necessary, but few boys will read one of\r\n  the series without wishing to peruse the others.\r\n\r\nIAN HARDY, NAVAL CADET\r\n\r\n  “A sound and wholesome story giving a lively picture of a naval\r\n  cadet’s life.”--_Birmingham Gazette._\r\n\r\n  “A very wholesome book for boys, and the lurking danger of Ian’s ill\r\n  deeds being imitated may be regarded as negligible in comparison\r\n  with the good likely to be done by the example of his manly, honest\r\n  nature. Ian was a boy whom his father might occasionally have reason\r\n  to whip, but never feel ashamed of.”--_United Service Magazine._\r\n\r\nIAN HARDY, MIDSHIPMAN\r\n\r\n  “A jolly sequel to his last year’s book.”--_Christian World._\r\n\r\n  “The ‘real thing.’... Certain to enthral boys of almost any age who\r\n  love stories of British pluck.”--_Observer._\r\n\r\n  “_Commander E.

Last year we knew him\r\n  as a cadet; this year we get _Ian Hardy, Midshipman_. The present\r\n  instalment of his stirring history is breezily written.”--_Yorkshire\r\n  Observer._\r\n\r\nIAN HARDY, SENIOR MIDSHIPMAN\r\n\r\n  “Of those who are now writing stories of the sea, Commander Currey\r\n  holds perhaps the leading position.
