Folds of lava rock look like coils of\r\n    irregular rope. Lava flows of this type are known as pahoehoe, a\r\n    Hawaiian word pronounced_ pah-hoy-hoy _and meaning ropey_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Rift Volcanism on the Snake River Plain\r\n\r\n\r\nLight playing on cobalt blue lavas of the Blue Dragon Flows caught the\r\ninner eye of explorer Robert Limbert: “It is the play of light at sunset\r\nacross this lava that charms the spectator. It becomes a twisted, wavy\r\nsea. In the moonlight its glazed surface has a silvery sheen. With\r\nchanging conditions of light and air, it varies also, even while one\r\nstands and watches. It is a place of color and silence....”\r\n\r\nLimbert explored the Craters of the Moon lava field in Idaho in the\r\n1920s and wrote those words for a 1924 issue of _National Geographic\r\nMagazine_. “For several years I had listened to stories told by fur\r\ntrappers of the strange things they had seen while ranging in this\r\nregion,” wrote Limbert, a sometime taxidermist, tanner, and furrier from\r\nBoise, Idaho. “Some of these accounts seemed beyond belief.” To Limbert\r\nit seemed extraordinary “That a region of such size and scenic\r\npeculiarity, in the heart of the great Northwest, could have remained\r\npractically unknown and unexplored....” On his third and most ambitious\r\ntrek, in 1924, Limbert and W. C. Cole were at times left speechless by\r\nthe lava landscape they explored. Limbert recounted his impressions in\r\nmagazine and newspaper articles whose publication was influential in the\r\narea’s being protected under federal ownership. In 1924, part of the\r\nlava field was proclaimed as Craters of the Moon National Monument,\r\nprotected under the Antiquities Act. It was created “to preserve the\r\nunusual and weird volcanic formations.” The boundary has been adjusted\r\nand the park enlarged since then. In 1970, a large part of the national\r\nmonument was designated by Congress as the Craters of the Moon\r\nWilderness. It is further protected under the National Wilderness\r\nPreservation System.\r\n\r\nUntil 1986, little was known about Limbert except for those facts\r\nrecounted above. That year, however, a researcher compiling a history of\r\nthe national monument located Limbert’s daughter in Boise. The daughter\r\nstill possessed hundreds of items, including early glass plate\r\nnegatives, photographs, and manuscripts of her father and that shed more\r\nlight on his life, the early days of Idaho, and Craters of the Moon.\r\nSome of these photographs served as blueprints for the National Park\r\nService in the rehabilitation of fragile spatter cone formations that\r\nhave deteriorated over the years of heavy human traffic. The Limbert\r\ncollection has been fully cataloged by Boise State University curators\r\nand has already proven to be a valuable resource to historians\r\ninterested in Limbert and this fascinating part of Idaho. Preservation\r\nof the area owes much to Limbert’s imaginative advocacy in the true\r\nspirit of the West in its earlier days.\r\n\r\nLocal legends, beginning in the late 1800s, held that this area\r\nresembled the surface of the moon, on which—it must now be remembered—no\r\none had then walked! Geologist Harold T. Stearns first used the name\r\nCraters of the Moon when he suggested to the National Park Service, in\r\n1923, that a national monument be established here. Stearns found “the\r\ndark craters and the cold lava, nearly destitute of vegetation” similar\r\nto “the surface of the moon as seen through a telescope.” The name\r\nCraters of the Moon would stick after Limbert adopted it in _National\r\nGeographic Magazine_ in 1924. Later that year the name became official\r\nwhen the area was set aside by President Calvin Coolidge as a national\r\nmonument under the Antiquities Act.\r\n\r\nLike some other areas in the National Park System, Craters of the Moon\r\nhas lived to see the name that its early explorers affixed to it proved\r\nsomewhat erroneous by subsequent events or findings. When Stearns and\r\nLimbert called this lava field Craters of the Moon, probably few persons\r\nother than science fiction buffs actually thought that human beings\r\nmight one day walk on the moon and see firsthand what its surface is\r\nlike. People have now walked on the moon, however, and we know that its\r\nsurface does not, in fact, closely resemble this part of Idaho. Although\r\nthere are some volcanic features on the surface of the moon, most of its\r\ncraters were formed by the impact of meteorites colliding with the moon.\r\n\r\nMoonscape or not, early fur trappers avoided the lava flows along the\r\nbase of the Pioneer Mountains at the north of today’s park. In doing so,\r\nthey followed Indian trails such as one found by Limbert that “resembled\r\na light streak winding through the lava. When the sun was directly\r\noverhead it could be seen to advantage, but at times was difficult to\r\nfollow. Think of the years of travel,” Limbert marveled, “necessary to\r\nmake that mark on rock!” At least one Indian trail was destined to\r\nbecome part of Goodale’s Cutoff, an alternative route on the Oregon\r\nTrail that pioneers in wagon trains used in the 1850s and 1860s. Many\r\nadjectives early used for this scene—weird, barren, exciting,\r\nawe-inspiring, monotonous, astonishing, curious, bleak, mysterious—still\r\napply. It is not difficult today to see why pioneering folk intent on\r\nwresting a living from the land did not tackle this volcanic terrain.\r\n\r\nGeologists possessed the proper motivation to tackle it, however.\r\nCuriosity aroused by this lava field has led several generations of\r\ngeologists, beginning with Israel C. Russell in 1901 and Harold T.\r\nStearns in the 1920s, into a deeper understanding of its volcanic\r\norigins. With ever increasing penetration of its geological history, the\r\napparent otherworldliness of Craters of the Moon has retreated—but not\r\nentirely. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\r\nbrought the second set of astronauts who would walk on the moon to this\r\nalien corner of the galaxy before their moonshot. Here they studied the\r\nvolcanic rock and explored an unusual, harsh, and unforgiving\r\nenvironment before embarking on their own otherworldly adventure.\r\n\r\nMost types of volcanic features in the park can be seen quite readily by\r\nfirst stopping at the visitor center and then driving the Loop Road. Far\r\nmore features can be seen if you also walk the interpretive trails at\r\nthe stops along the Loop Road. Still more await those who invest the\r\ntime required to come to feel the mysterious timelessness and raw\r\nnatural force implicit in this expansive lava field. Many travelers are\r\nen route to Yellowstone National Park and spend only a couple of hours\r\nvisiting Craters of the Moon. This is ironic because here you are on the\r\ngeological track of Yellowstone. In fact, Craters of the Moon represents\r\nwhat Yellowstone’s landscape will resemble in the future, and both areas\r\ncan supplement your insight into what happens when the Earth’s\r\nunimaginable inner forces erupt to its surface.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Silvery leaves of the buckwheat dot a cinder garden\r\n    with such regular spacing they almost look planted. Such spacing\r\n    results from the shortage of available surface water: Each plant\r\n    controls with its roots the space surrounding it, discouraging\r\n    competing plants. Rainwater and snowmelt penetrate volcanic cinders\r\n    so readily that their moisture quickly drops beyond reach of most\r\n    plants’ root systems. For a close-up view of a buckwheat, see page\r\n    36._]\r\n\r\nAlthough Idaho is famous for forests, rivers, and scenic mountain\r\nwilderness, its Snake River Plain region boasts little of these\r\nattributes. This plain arcs across southern Idaho from the Oregon border\r\nto the Yellowstone area at the Montana-Wyoming border. It marks the\r\ntrail of the passage of the Earth’s crust over an unusual geologic heat\r\nsource that now brings the Earth’s incendiary inner workings so close to\r\nits surface near Yellowstone. This heat source fuels Yellowstone’s\r\nbubbling, spewing, spouting geothermal wonders. Craters of the Moon\r\ntherefore stands as a geologic prelude to Yellowstone, as its precursor\r\nand the ancestral stuff of its fiery secrets.\r\n\r\nWhen did all this volcanism at Craters of the Moon happen? Will it\r\nhappen again? According to Mel Kuntz and other U.S. Geological Survey\r\ngeologists who have conducted extensive field research at Craters of the\r\nMoon, the volcanic activity forming the Craters of the Moon lava field\r\nprobably started _only_ 15,000 years ago. The last eruption in the\r\nvolcanic cycle ended 2,000 years ago, about the time that Julius Caesar\r\nruled the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nCraters of the Moon is a dormant, but not extinct, volcanic area. Its\r\nsleeping volcanoes could become active again in the near future. The\r\nlargest earthquake of the last quarter century in the contiguous United\r\nStates shook Idaho’s tallest mountain, Borah Peak, just north of here in\r\n1983. When it did, some geologists wondered if it might initiate\r\nvolcanic activity at Craters of the Moon. It did not. According to\r\nKuntz, however, this is no reason not to expect another volcanic\r\neruption here _soon_—probably “within the next 1,000 years.” Part Two of\r\nthis handbook explores the still young and rapidly evolving\r\nunderstanding of the fascinating geologic story of Craters of the Moon.\r\n\r\nToday’s Craters of the Moon National Monument encompasses 83 square\r\nmiles of the much larger Craters of the Moon lava field. Reaching\r\nsoutheastward from the Pioneer Mountains, the park boundary encloses a\r\nseries of fissure vents, volcanic cones, and lava flows known as the\r\nGreat Rift volcanic zone. This volcanic rift zone is a line of weakness\r\nin the Earth’s crust that can be traced for some 60 miles across the\r\nSnake River Plain. Recent volcanism marks much of its length. You can\r\nexplore the Great Rift and some of its volcanic features via the park’s\r\n7-mile Loop Drive, as described in Part Three of this handbook. In the\r\npark’s northern part you will find spatter cones, cinder cones, lava\r\nflows, lava caves, and an unexpected variety of wildflowers, shrubs,\r\ntrees, and wild animals. The much larger southern part of the park,\r\ndesignated by Congress in 1970 as the Craters of the Moon Wilderness\r\nArea, is a vast and largely untraveled region of stark volcanic features\r\nflanking the Great Rift. It offers a challenge to serious hikers and\r\nexplorers—latter day Robert Limberts—who are prepared for rugged\r\nwilderness travel.\r\n\r\nDespite its seeming barrenness, Craters of the Moon is indeed home to a\r\nsurprising diversity of plant and animal life. As Limbert noted in 1924:\r\n“In the West the term ‘Lava Beds of Idaho’ has always signified a region\r\nto be shunned by even the most venturesome travelers—a land supposedly\r\nbarren of vegetation, destitute of water, devoid of animal life, and\r\nlacking in scenic interest.\r\n\r\n“In reality the region has slight resemblance to its imagined aspect.\r\nIts vegetation is mostly hidden in pockets, but when found consists of\r\npines, cedars, junipers, and sagebrush: its water is hidden deep in\r\ntanks or holes at the bottom of large ‘blow-outs’ and is found only by\r\nfollowing old Indian or mountain sheep trails or by watching the flight\r\nof birds as they drop into these places to quench their thirst. The\r\nanimal life consists principally of migrant birds, rock rabbits,\r\nwoodchucks, black and grizzly bears: its scenery is impressive in its\r\ngrandeur.”\r\n\r\nYears of patient record-keeping by scientists have fit numbers to\r\nLimbert’s perceptive observations. The number of species identified\r\nincludes more than 300 plants, 2,000 insects, 8 reptiles, 140 birds, 30\r\nmammals—and one amphibian, the western toad. We now call Limbert’s “rock\r\nrabbit” the pika. The grizzly is long gone here. With few exceptions,\r\nthe park’s denizens live mostly under conditions of great environmental\r\nstress.\r\n\r\nNear constant winds, breeze-to-gale in strength, sweep across the park\r\nto rob moisture from all living things. Scant soils, low levels of\r\nprecipitation, the inability of cinder cones to hold rainwater near the\r\nsurface, and the heat of the summer sun—intensified by heat-absorbing\r\nblack lavas—only aggravate such moisture theft. Cinder surfaces register\r\nsummer soil temperatures of over 150°F and show a lack of plant cover.\r\nPlants cover generally less than 5 percent of the total surface of the\r\ncinder cones. A recent study found that when the area is looked at on a\r\nparkwide basis, most of the land is very sparsely vegetated (less than\r\n15 percent vegetative cover). On a scale of sand trap to putting green,\r\nthis would approach the sand trap end of the scale.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Winter snow transforms these landscapes, smoothing\r\n    out both contours and the jagged edges of lavas. Less lunar in\r\n    appearance now, the park nonetheless maintains an otherworldly\r\n    aura._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The park was named in 1924, 45 years before humans\r\n    walked on the Moon. Although we now know more about the Moon’s\r\n    actual surface, the park’s name still rings true. Only a few trees\r\n    immediately suggest that the large photo was taken on Earth. In the\r\n    inset photo, astronaut Edwin E. “Buzz” Aldrin walks on the Moon near\r\n    the lunar module._]\r\n\r\nInto this difficult environment wildlife researcher Brad Griffith\r\nventured to count, mark, and scrutinize the mule deer of Craters of the\r\nMoon in May 1980. Griffith, of the University of Idaho, conducted a\r\nthree-year study of the park’s mule deer population because the National\r\nPark Service was concerned that this protected and productive herd might\r\nmultiply so much that it would eventually damage its habitat. Among\r\nother things, he would find that the herd has developed a drought\r\nevasion strategy that makes it behave unlike any mule deer population\r\nknown anywhere else.\r\n\r\n“By late summer,” Griffith explains, “plants have matured and dried so\r\nthat they no longer provide adequate moisture to sustain the deer in\r\nthis landscape that offers them no free water. Following about 12 days\r\nof warm nights and hot days in late July, the deer migrate from 5 to 10\r\nmiles north to the Pioneer Mountains. There they find free-flowing\r\ncreeks and the cool, moist shade of aspen and Douglas-fir groves and\r\nwait out summer’s worst heat and dryness. Early fall rains trigger the\r\ndeer’s return to the park’s wilderness from this oasis in late September\r\nto feed on the nutritious bitterbrush until November snowfalls usher\r\nthem back to their winter range.”\r\n\r\nThe pristine and high-quality forage of the Craters of the Moon\r\nWilderness Area, historically nearly untouched by domestic livestock\r\ngrazing, has inspired this migratory strategy for evading drought. In\r\neffect, the mule deer make use of a dual summer range, a behavioral\r\nmodification unknown elsewhere for their species.\r\n\r\n“Their late summer and fall adaptations simply complete the mule deer’s\r\nyearlong strategy for coping with the limits that this volcanic\r\nlandscape imposes on them,” Griffith explains.\r\n\r\nTaking a walk in the park on a mid-summer afternoon gives you a good\r\nopportunity to experience the influence of wind, heat, and lack of\r\nmoisture. The park’s winds are particularly striking. The lava that has\r\nflowed out of the Great Rift has built up and raised the land surface in\r\nthe park to a higher elevation than its surroundings so that it\r\nintercepts the prevailing southwesterly winds. Afternoon winds usually\r\ndie down in the evening. As part of the dynamics of temperature and\r\nmoisture that determine mule deer behavior, this daily wind cycle helps\r\nexplain why they are more active at night than are mule deer elsewhere.\r\nThese deer do not move around as much as mule deer in less ecologically\r\ntrying areas. They have adapted behaviors to conserve energy and\r\nmoisture in this environmentally stressful landscape.\r\n\r\nEarly mornings may find park rangers climbing up a cinder cone to count\r\nthe deer, continuing the collection of data that Brad Griffith set in\r\nmotion with his three-year study. The rangers still conduct spring and\r\nlate summer censuses: over a recent three-year period the deer\r\npopulations averaged about 420 animals. Another several years of\r\ncollecting will give the National Park Service a body of data on the\r\nmule deer that is available nowhere else.\r\n\r\nThe uniqueness of this data about the park’s mule deer population would\r\nsurely please the booster aspect of Robert Limbert’s personality.\r\nLikewise, the research challenges involved in obtaining it would appeal\r\nto his explorer self. History has justified Limbert on both counts.\r\nPublicity arising from his explorations led to creation of the national\r\nmonument. Furthermore, that publicity put forth a rather heady claim\r\nthat history has also unequivocally borne out: “Although almost totally\r\nunknown at present,” Limbert prophesied in 1924, “this section is\r\ndestined some day to attract tourists from all America....”\r\n\r\nEvery year tens of thousands of travelers fulfill Robert Limbert’s\r\nprophecy of more than a half-century ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Part 2\r\n                      From Moonscape to Landscape\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _What last happened here about 2,000 years ago looked\r\n    much like this photograph of a volcanic eruption in Hawaii.\r\n    Bubbling, pooling, and flowing lava blanketed the landscape as\r\n    molten materials poured or gushed out of the Earth. Most volcanic\r\n    phenomena preserved at Craters of the Moon have been seen in action\r\n    in Hawaii._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Geology of the Craters of the Moon\r\n\r\n\r\nA 400-mile-long arc known as the Snake River Plain cuts a swath from 30\r\nto 125 miles wide across southern Idaho. Idaho’s official state highway\r\nmap, which depicts mountains with shades of green, shows this arc as\r\nwhite because there is comparatively little variation here compared to\r\nmost of the state. Upon this plain, immense amounts of lava from within\r\nthe Earth have been deposited by volcanic activity dating back more than\r\n14 million years. However, some of these lavas, notably those at Craters\r\nof the Moon National Monument, emerged from the Earth as recently as\r\n2,000 years ago. Craters of the Moon contains some of the best examples\r\nof basaltic volcanism in the world. To understand what happened here,\r\nyou must understand the Snake River Plain.\r\n\r\nBasaltic and Rhyolitic Lavas. The lavas deposited on the Snake River\r\nPlain were mainly of two types classified as basaltic and rhyolitic.\r\nMagma, the molten rock material beneath the surface of the Earth, issues\r\nfrom a volcano as lava. The composition of this fluid rock material\r\nvaries. Basaltic lavas are composed of magma originating at the boundary\r\nof the Earth’s mantle and its crustal layer. Rhyolitic lavas originate\r\nfrom crustal material. To explain its past, geologists now divide the\r\nSnake River Plain into eastern and western units. The following geologic\r\nstory relates to the eastern Snake River Plain, on which Craters of the\r\nMoon lies.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern Snake River Plain, basaltic and rhyolitic lavas formed in\r\ntwo different stages of volcanic activity. Younger basaltic lavas mostly\r\nlie atop older rhyolitic lavas. This portion of the plain runs from\r\nnorth of Twin Falls eastward to the Yellowstone area on the\r\nWyoming-Montana border. Drilling to depths of almost 2 miles near the\r\nplain’s midline, geologists found ½ mile of basaltic lava flows lying\r\natop more than 1½ miles of rhyolitic lava flows. How much deeper the\r\nrhyolitic lavas may extend is not known. No one has drilled deeper here.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Crossing Idaho in an arc, the Snake River Plain\r\n    marks the path of the Earth’s crustal plate as it migrates over a\r\n    heat source unusually close to the surface. It is believed that the\r\n    heat source fueling Yellowstone’s thermal features today is\r\n    essentially the same one that produced volcanic episodes at Craters\r\n    of the Moon ending about 2,000 years ago._]\r\n\r\nThis combination—a thinner layer of younger basaltic lavas lying atop an\r\nolder and thicker layer of rhyolitic lavas—is typical of volcanic\r\nactivity associated with an unusual heat phenomenon inside the Earth\r\nthat some geologists have described as a mantle plume. The mantle plume\r\ntheory was developed in the early 1970s as an explanation for the\r\ncreation of the Hawaiian Islands. According to the theory, uneven\r\nheating within the Earth’s core allows some material in the overlying\r\nmantle to become slightly hotter than surrounding material. As its\r\ntemperature increases, its density decreases. Thus it becomes relatively\r\nbuoyant and rises through the cooler materials—like a tennis ball\r\nreleased underwater—toward the Earth’s crust. When this molten material\r\nreaches the crust it eventually melts and pushes itself through the\r\ncrust and it erupts onto the Earth’s surface as molten lava.\r\n\r\nThe Earth’s crust is made up of numerous plates that float upon an\r\nunderlying mantle layer. Therefore, over time, the presence of an\r\nunusual heat source created by a mantle plume will be expressed at the\r\nEarth’s surface—floating in a constant direction above it—as a line of\r\nvolcanic eruptions. The Snake River Plain records the progress of the\r\nNorth American crustal plate—350 miles in 15 million years—over a heat\r\nsource now located below Yellowstone. The Hawaiian chain of islands\r\nmarks a similar line. Because the mechanisms that cause this geologic\r\naction are not well understood, many geologists refer to this simply as\r\na heat source rather than a mantle plume.\r\n\r\nTwo Stages of Volcanism. As described above, volcanic eruptions\r\nassociated with this heat source occur in two stages, rhyolitic and\r\nbasaltic. As the upwelling magma from the mantle collects in a chamber\r\nas it enters the Earth’s lower crust, its heat begins to melt the\r\nsurrounding crustal rock. Since this rock contains a large amount of\r\nsilica, it forms a thick and pasty rhyolitic magma. Rhyolitic magma is\r\nlighter than the overlying crustal rocks, therefore, it begins to rise\r\nand form a second magma chamber very close to the Earth’s surface. As\r\nmore and more of this gas-charged rhyolitic magma collects in this upper\r\ncrustal chamber, the gas pressure builds to a point at which the magma\r\nexplodes through the Earth’s crust.\r\n\r\nExplosive Rhyolitic Volcanism. Rhyolitic explosions tend to be\r\ndevastating. When the gas-charged molten material reaches the surface of\r\nthe Earth, the gas expands rapidly, perhaps as much as 25 to 75 times by\r\nvolume. The reaction is similar to the bubbles that form in a bottle of\r\nsoda pop that has been shaken. You can shake the container and the\r\npressure-bottled liquid will retain its volume as long as the cap is\r\ntightly sealed. Release the pressure by removing the bottle cap,\r\nhowever, and the soft drink will spray all over the room and occupy a\r\nvolume of space far larger than the bottle from which it issued. This\r\ninitial vast spray is then followed by a foaming action as the less\r\ngas-charged liquid now bubbles out of the bottle.\r\n\r\nCollectively, the numerous rhyolitic explosions that occurred on the\r\nSnake River Plain ejected hundreds of cubic miles of material into the\r\natmosphere and onto the Earth’s surface. In contrast, the eruption of\r\nMount Saint Helens in 1980, which killed 65 people and devastated 150\r\nsquare miles of forest, produced less than 1 cubic mile of ejected\r\nmaterial. So much material was ejected in the massive rhyolitic\r\nexplosions in the Snake River Plain that the Earth’s surface collapsed\r\nto form huge depressions known as calderas. (Like _caldron_, whose root\r\nmeaning it shares, this name implies both bowl-shaped and warmed.) Most\r\nevidence of these gigantic explosive volcanoes in the Snake River Plain\r\nhas been covered by subsequent flows of basaltic lava. However, traces\r\nof rhyolitic eruptions are found along the margins of the plain and in\r\nthe Yellowstone area.\r\n\r\nQuiet Outpourings of Basaltic Lava. As this area of the Earth’s crust\r\npassed over and then beyond the sub-surface heat source, the explosive\r\nvolcanism of the rhyolitic stage ceased. The heat contained in the\r\nEarth’s upper mantle and crust, however, remained and continued to\r\nproduce upwelling magma. This was basaltic magma that, because it\r\ncontained less silica than rhyolite, was very fluid.\r\n\r\nThe basalt, like the rhyolite, collected in isolated magma chambers\r\nwithin the crust until pressures built up to force it to the surface\r\nthrough various cracks and fissures. These weak spots in the Earth’s\r\ncrust were the results of earlier geologic activity, expansion of the\r\nmagma chamber, or the formation of a rift zone.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Microscopic cross section of basaltic rock._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Microscopic cross section of rhyolitic rock. Cross\r\n    sections show vastly different textures. Rhyolitic magma contains\r\n    more silica; it is very thick and does not allow trapped gas to\r\n    escape easily. Its volcanic eruptions blast large craters in the\r\n    Earth’s crust. Basaltic magma is more fluid and allows gas to escape\r\n    readily. It erupts more gently. Here in the eastern Snake River\r\n    Plain, basaltic lava flows almost completely cover earlier rhyolitic\r\n    deposits._]\r\n\r\n(_continued on page 28_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Identifying the Lava Flows\r\n\r\n  At Craters of the Moon the black rocks are lava flows. The surface\r\n  lava rocks, basaltic in composition, formed from magma originating\r\n  deep in the Earth. They are named for their appearances: Pahoehoe\r\n  (pronounced “pah-hoy-hoy” and meaning “ropey”), Aa (pronounced “ah-ah”\r\n  and meaning “rough”), or Blocky. Geologists have seen how these flows\r\n  behave in modern volcanic episodes in Hawaii and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Pahoehoe lava_]\r\n\r\n  Pahoehoe More than half the park is covered by pahoehoe lava flows.\r\n  Rivers of molten rock, they harden quickly to a relatively smooth\r\n  surface, billowly, hummocky, or flat. Other pahoehoe formations\r\n  resemble coiled, heavy rope or ice jams.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Aa lava_]\r\n\r\n  Aa Aa flows are far more rugged than pahoehoe flows. Most occur when a\r\n  pahoehoe flow cools, thickens, and then turns into aa. Often\r\n  impassable to those traveling afoot, aa flows quickly chew up hiking\r\n  boots. Blocky lava is a variety of aa lava whose relatively large\r\n  silica content makes it thick and often dense, glassy, and smooth.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Blocky lava_]\r\n\r\n  Bombs Lava pieces blown out of craters may solidify in flight. They\r\n  are classed by shape: spindle, ribbon, and breadcrust. Bombs range\r\n  from ½ inch to more than 3 feet long.\r\n\r\n  Tree Molds When molten lava advances on a living forest, resulting\r\n  tree molds may record impressions of charred surfaces of trees in the\r\n  lava.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Blue Dragon Flows lava_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Breadcrust bomb_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Spindle bomb_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Wood-like lava_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Tree mold_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Lava river_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Mt. St. Helens erupts in 1980. Because the lava\r\n    contained a large amount of silica, its explosive eruption contrasts\r\n    sharply with recent basaltic flows in volcanic activity in Hawaii._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Basaltic flows in Hawaii.]\r\n\r\nUpon reaching the surface, the gases contained within the lava easily\r\nescaped and produced rather mild eruptions. Instead of exploding into\r\nthe air like earlier rhyolitic activity, the more fluid basaltic lava\r\nflooded out onto the surrounding landscape. These flows were fairly\r\nextensive and often covered many square miles. After millions of years,\r\nmost of the older rhyolitic deposits have been covered by these basaltic\r\nlava flows.\r\n\r\nThe Great Rift and Craters of the Moon. Craters of the Moon National\r\nMonument lies along a volcanic rift zone. Rift zones occur where the\r\nEarth’s crust is being pulled in opposite directions. Geologists believe\r\nthat the interactions of the Earth’s crustal plates in the vicinity of\r\nthe Snake River Plain have stretched, thinned, and weakened the Earth’s\r\ncrust so that cracks have formed both on and below the surface here.\r\nMagma under pressure can follow these cracks and fissures to the\r\nsurface. While there are many volcanic rift zones throughout the Snake\r\nRiver Plain, the most extensive is the Great Rift that runs through\r\nCraters of the Moon. The Great Rift is approximately 60 miles long and\r\nit ranges in width from 1½ to 5 miles. It is marked by short cracks—less\r\nthan 1 mile in length—and the alignment of more than 25 volcanic cinder\r\ncones. It is the site of origin for more than 60 different lava flows\r\nthat make up the Craters of the Moon Lava Field.\r\n\r\nEight Major Eruptive Periods. Most of the lavas exposed at Craters of\r\nthe Moon formed between 2,000 and 15,000 years ago in basaltic eruptions\r\nthat comprise the second stage of volcanism associated with the mantle\r\nplume theory. These eight eruptive periods each lasted about 1,000 years\r\nor less and were separated by periods of relative calm that lasted for a\r\nfew hundred to more than 2,000 years. These sequences of eruptions and\r\ncalm periods are caused by the alternating build up and release of\r\nmagmatic pressure inside the Earth. Once an eruption releases this\r\npressure, time is required for it to build up again.\r\n\r\nEruptions have been dated by two methods: paleomagnetic and radiocarbon\r\ndating. Paleomagnetic dating compares the alignment of magnetic minerals\r\nwithin the rock of flows with past orientations of the Earth’s magnetic\r\nfields. Radiocarbon dating makes use of radioactive carbon-14 in\r\ncharcoal created from vegetation that is overrun by lava flows. Dates\r\nobtained by both methods are considered to be accurate to within about\r\n100 years.\r\n\r\nA Typical Eruption at Craters of the Moon. Research at the monument and\r\nobservations of similar eruptions in Hawaii and Iceland suggest the\r\nfollowing scenario for a typical eruption at Craters of the Moon.\r\nVarious forces combine to cause a section of the Great Rift to pull\r\napart. When the forces that tend to pull the Earth’s crust apart are\r\ncombined with the forces created as magma accumulates, the crust becomes\r\nweakened and cracks form. As the magma rises buoyantly within these\r\ncracks, the pressure exerted on it is reduced and the gases within the\r\nmagma begin to expand. As gas continues to expand, the magma becomes\r\nfrothy.\r\n\r\nAt first the lava is very fluid and charged with gas. Eruptions begin as\r\na long line of fountains that reach heights of 1,000 feet or less and\r\nare up to a mile in length. This “curtain of fire eruption” mainly\r\nproduces cinders and frothy, fluid lava. After hours or days, the\r\nexpansion of gases decreases and eruptions become less violent. Segments\r\nof the fissure seal off and eruptions become smaller and more localized.\r\nCinders thrown up in the air now build piles around individual vents and\r\nform cinder cones.\r\n\r\nWith further reductions in the gas content of the magma, the volcanic\r\nactivity again changes. Huge outpourings of lava are pumped out of the\r\nvarious fissures or the vents of cinder cones and form lava flows. Lava\r\nflows may form over periods of months or possibly a few years. Long-term\r\neruptions of lava flows from a single vent become the source of most of\r\nthe material produced during a sustained eruption. As gas pressure falls\r\nand magma is depleted, flows subside. Finally, all activity stops.\r\n\r\nWhen Will the Next Eruption Occur? Craters of the Moon is not an extinct\r\nvolcanic area. It is merely in a dormant stage of its eruptive sequence.\r\nBy dating the lava flow, geologists have shown that the volcanic\r\nactivity along the Great Rift has been persistent over the last 15,000\r\nyears, occurring approximately every 2,000 years. Because the last\r\neruptions took place about 2,000 years ago, geologists believe that\r\neruptions are due here again—probably within the next 1,000 years.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _From the air the Great Rift looks like an\r\n    irregularly dashed line punctuated by tell-tale cones and craters._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Chainlike, the Hawaiian group of islands traces the\r\n    migration of Earth’s crustal plate over an unusual undersea heat\r\n    source. The Hawaiian chain of islands and the Snake River Plain map\r\n    similar happenings._]\r\n\r\n(_continued on page 34_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Indian Tunnel\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\n  Indian Tunnel looks like a cave, but it is a lava tube. When a\r\n  pahoehoe lava flow is exposed to the air, its surface begins to cool\r\n  and harden. A crust or skin develops. As the flow moves away from its\r\n  source, the crust thickens and forms an insulating barrier between\r\n  cool air and molten material in the flow’s interior. A rigid roof now\r\n  exists over the stream of lava whose molten core moves forward at a\r\n  steady pace. As the flow of lava from the source vent is depleted, the\r\n  level of lava within the molten core gradually begins to drop. The\r\n  flowing interior then pulls away from the hardening roof above and\r\n  slowly drains away and out. The roof and last remnants of the lava\r\n  river inside it cool and harden, leaving a tube.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Lava tube_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Great horned owl_]\r\n\r\n  Many lava tubes make up the Indian Tunnel Lava Tube System. These\r\n  tubes formed during the same eruption within a single lava flow whose\r\n  source was a fissure or crack in the Big Craters/Spatter Cones area. A\r\n  tremendous amount of lava was pumped out here, forming the Blue Dragon\r\n  Flows. (Hundreds of tiny crystals on its surface produce the color\r\n  blue when light strikes them.) Lava forced through the roof of the\r\n  tube system formed huge ponds whose surfaces cooled and began to\r\n  harden. Later these ponds collapsed as lava drained back into the lava\r\n  tubes. Big Sink is the largest of these collapses. Blue Dragon Flows\r\n  cover an area of more than 100 square miles. Hidden beneath are miles\r\n  of lava tubes, but collapsed roof sections called skylights provide\r\n  entry to only a small part of the system. Only time, with the collapse\r\n  of more roofs, will reveal the total extent of the system.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Icicles (ice stalactites)_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Lava stalactites_]\r\n\r\n  Stalactites Dripped from hot ceilings, lava forms stalactites that\r\n  hang from above. Mineral deposits Sulfate compounds formed on many\r\n  lava tube ceilings from volcanic gases or by evaporation of matter\r\n  leached from rocks above. Ice In spring, ice stalactites form on cave\r\n  ceilings and walls. Ice stalagmites form on the cave floor. Summer\r\n  heat destroys these features. Wildlife Lava tube beetles, bushy-tailed\r\n  woodrats (packrats), and bats live in some dark caves. Violet-green\r\n  swallows, great horned owls, and ravens may use wall cracks and\r\n  shelves of well-lit caves for nesting sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Cinder Cones and Spatter Cones\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Cinder cone_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Spatter cone_]\r\n\r\n  Cinder Cones When volcanic eruptions of fairly moderate strength throw\r\n  cinders into the air, cinder cones may be built up. These cone-shaped\r\n  hills are usually truncated, looking as though their tops were sliced\r\n  off. Usually, a bowl- or funnel-shaped crater will form inside the\r\n  cone. Cinders, which cooled rapidly while falling through the air, are\r\n  highly porous with gas vesicles, like bubbles. Cinder cones hundreds\r\n  of feet high may be built in a few days. Big Cinder Butte is a cinder\r\n  cone. At 700 feet high it is the tallest cone in the park. The shape\r\n  develops because the largest fragments, and in fact most of the\r\n  fragments, fall closest to the vent. The angle of slope is usually\r\n  about 30 degrees. Some cinder cones, such as North Crater, the\r\n  Watchman, and Sheep Trail Butte, were built by more than one eruptive\r\n  episode. Younger lava was added to them as a vent was rejuvenated. If\r\n  strong winds prevailed during a cinder cone’s formation, the cone may\r\n  be elongated—in the direction the wind was blowing—rather than\r\n  circular. Grassy, Paisley, Sunset, and Inferno Cones are elongated to\r\n  the east because the dominant winds in this area come from the west.\r\n  The northernmost section of the Great Rift contains the most cinder\r\n  cones for three reasons: 1. There were more eruptions at that end of\r\n  the rift. 2. The lavas erupted there were thicker, resulting in more\r\n  explosive eruptions. (They are more viscous because they contain more\r\n  silica.) 3. Large amounts of groundwater may have been present at the\r\n  northern boundary of the lavas and when it came in contact with magma\r\n  it generated huge amounts of steam. All of these conditions lead to\r\n  more extensive and more explosive eruptions that tend to create cinder\r\n  cones rather than lava flows.\r\n\r\n  Spatter Cones When most of its gas content has dissipated, lava\r\n  becomes less frothy and more tacky. Then it is tossed out of the vent\r\n  as globs or clots of lava paste called spatter. The clots partially\r\n  weld together to build up spatter cones. Spatter cones are typically\r\n  much smaller than cinder cones, but they may have steeper sides. The\r\n  Spatter Cones area of the park (Stop 5 on the map of the Loop Drive)\r\n  contains one of the most perfect spatter-cone chains in the world.\r\n  These cones are all less than 50 feet high and less than 100 feet in\r\n  diameter.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Lichens often pioneer new life on Earth. Two plants\r\n    in one, lichens are composed of an alga and a fungus growing\r\n    together to their mutual benefit, usually on rock. Hardy and\r\n    slow-growing, lichens help break down rock to soil-building mineral\r\n    matter._\r\n\r\n    _Eventually their vegetable matter decays, helping to form the first\r\n    soils that other plants can then use. Tough in the extreme, some\r\n    lichens can be heated to high temperatures and still be capable of\r\n    resuming normal growth when returned to viable conditions._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Life Adapts to a Volcanic Landscape\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo thousand years after volcanic eruptions subsided, plants and animals\r\nstill struggle to gain toeholds on this unforgiving lava field. Much of\r\nthe world’s vegetation could not survive here at all. Environmental\r\nstresses created by scant soil and minimal moisture are compounded by\r\nhighly porous cinders that are incapable of holding water near the\r\nground surface where plants and other organisms can make ready use of\r\nit. Scarce at best—total average precipitation is between 15 to 20\r\ninches per year—rainwater and snowmelt quickly slip down out of reach of\r\nthe plants growing on cinder cones. Summer’s hot, dry winds rob moisture\r\nfrom all living things exposed to them. Whisking across leaves and\r\nneedles the winds carry away moisture precious to plant tissues. On the\r\nside of a cinder cone, summer day temperatures at ground level can be\r\nmore than 150°F.\r\n\r\nThe secret to survival here is adaptation. Most life forms cope by\r\nstrategies of either resisting or evading the extremes of this semi-arid\r\nclimate. To resist being robbed of moisture by winds and heat, a plant\r\nmay feature very small leaves that minimize moisture loss. To evade\r\nheat, wind, and aridity, another plant may grow inside a crevice that\r\nprovides life-giving shade and collects precious moisture and soil\r\nparticles. Another plant may spend about 95 percent of the year dormant.\r\nIt may rush through the germination, sprouting, leafing out, blooming,\r\nand fruiting stages and return to the dormancy of its seed stage in just\r\ntwo weeks. The dwarf buckwheat has adapted to life on porous cinders by\r\nevolving a root system that may spread out for up to 3 feet to support\r\nits aboveground part, which is a mere 4 inches high. This buckwheat only\r\nlooks like a dwarf because you can not see its roots.\r\n\r\n                                                  (_continued on page 40_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Plants Adapt to a Volcanic Landscape\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\n  Water is the limiting factor in plant growth and reproduction both on\r\n  the lava fields of Craters of the Moon and on the surrounding\r\n  sagebrush steppe. Plants have developed a combination of adaptations\r\n  to cope with drought conditions. There are three major strategies:\r\n\r\n  1. Drought tolerance Physiological adaptations leading to drought\r\n  tolerance are typical of desert plant species. The tissues of some\r\n  plants can withstand extreme dehydration without suffering permanent\r\n  cell damage. Some plants can extract water from very dry soils.\r\n  Sagebrush and antelope bitterbrush exemplify drought tolerance.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Dwarf monkeyflower_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Buckwheat_]\r\n\r\n  2. Drought avoidance Certain structural modifications can enable\r\n  plants to retain or conserve water. Common adaptations of this type\r\n  include small leaves, hairiness, and succulence. The small leaves of\r\n  the antelope bitterbrush expose less area to evaporative influences\r\n  such as heat and wind. Hairs on the scorpionweed reduce surface\r\n  evaporation by inhibiting air flow and reflecting sunlight. Succulent\r\n  plants such as pricklypear cactus have tissues that can store water\r\n  for use during drought periods. Other plants, such as wire lettuce,\r\n  avoid drought by having very little leaf surface compared to their\r\n  overall volume.\r\n\r\n  3. Drought escape  Some plants, such as mosses and ferns, escape\r\n  drought by growing near persistent water supplies such as natural\r\n  potholes and seeps from ice caves. Many other drought escapers, such\r\n  as dwarf monkeyflower, simply carry out their full life cycle during\r\n  the moist time of the year. The rest of the year they survive in seed\r\n  form.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Pricklypear cactus_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Ferns_]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Plant Microhabitats\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\n  Lava flows Most plants cannot grow on lava flows until enough soil has\r\n  accumulated to support them. The park’s older volcanic landscapes,\r\n  where soils are best developed, are clothed with sagebrush-grassland\r\n  vegetation. On younger lava flows, bits of soil first accumulate in\r\n  cracks, joints, and crevices. It is in these microhabitats that\r\n  vascular plants may gain footholds. Narrow cracks and joints may\r\n  contain desert parsley and lava phlox. Shallow crevices will hold\r\n  scabland penstemon, fernleaf fleabane, and gland cinquefoil. Deep\r\n  crevices can support the syringa, various ferns, bush rockspirea,\r\n  tansybush, and even limber pine. Not until full soil cover is achieved\r\n  can the antelope bitterbrush, rubber rabbitbrush, and sagebrush find\r\n  suitable niches. On lava flows soils first form from eroded lava and\r\n  the slow decomposition of lichens and other plants able to colonize\r\n  bare rock. These soils can be supplemented by wind-blown soil\r\n  particles until vascular plants gain footholds. As plants begin to\r\n  grow and then die, their gradual decomposition adds further soil\r\n  matter. These soil beginnings accumulate in cracks and crevices, which\r\n  also provide critical shade and wind protection. Deep crevices provide\r\n  lower temperatures favoring plant survival.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Rubber rabbitbrush_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Syringa_]\r\n\r\n  Cinder gardens Compared to the lava flows, cinder cones are much more\r\n  quickly invaded by plants. Here, too, however, volcanic origins\r\n  influence plant growth. Compared to the relatively level lava flows,\r\n  steeply sloping cinder cones introduce a new factor that controls the\r\n  development of plant communities: topography. Here you find marked\r\n  differences in the plant communities between the north- and\r\n  south-facing slopes. South-facing slopes are exposed to prolonged,\r\n  intense sunlight, resulting in high evaporation of water. Because of\r\n  the prevailing winds, snow accumulates on northeast sides of cones,\r\n  giving them far more annual water than southwest-facing sides receive.\r\n  The pioneering herbs that first colonize cinder cones will persist on\r\n  southwest-facing slopes long after succeeding plant communities have\r\n  come to dominate north-facing slopes. It is on these north-facing\r\n  slopes that limber pine first develops in the cinder garden.\r\n  South-facing slopes may never support the limber pine but may be\r\n  dominated by shrubs. Unweathered cinder particles range in size from 3\r\n  to 4 inches in diameter down to very small particles. They average\r\n  about ¼ inch in diameter.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Cinquefoil_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Wire lettuce_]\r\n\r\nEcological conditions at Craters of the Moon are generally so harsh that\r\nslight changes can make the difference for the survival of a plant or\r\nother organism. Life thrives in many rock crevices that are surrounded\r\nby barren exposed lava rock of the same physical composition. These\r\nmicrohabitats provide the critical shade and increased soil and moisture\r\ncontent required for plant survival. Over the years, particles of soil\r\nwill naturally collect in rock crevices, which also have the effect of\r\nfunneling precipitation into their depths. Their shade further protects\r\nthese pockets of soil and water from wind erosion, excessive heat, and\r\nevaporation and leaching by direct sunlight.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Limber pines are the tree pioneers of the lava\r\n    terrain. Their seedlings often find suitable conditions for\r\n    germination in rock crevices long before surrounding landscapes\r\n    support tree growth. Most common of all the park’s trees, limber\r\n    pine is named for its flexible branches. Many park animals depend on\r\n    this tree in some fashion for their livelihoods._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Limber pine cones stay green and resinous through\r\n    their first year of development and then turn brown and woody as\r\n    their seeds mature in the second year. Cones grow to about 4 inches\r\n    long._]\r\n\r\nAt Craters of the Moon, crevices are of such importance to plants that\r\nbotanists differentiate between narrow, shallow, and deep crevices when\r\nstudying this phenomenon. Narrow crevices will support dwarf goldenweed\r\nor hairy goldaster. Shallow crevices support scabland penstemon,\r\nfernleaf fleabane, and gland cinquefoil. Deep crevices give rise to\r\nsyringa, ferns, bush rockspirea, tansybush, Lewis mockorange, and even\r\nthe limber pine tree. Complete soil cover and then vegetative cover can\r\ndevelop on these lava flows only after crevices have first become filled\r\nwith soil.\r\n\r\nPlants exploit other means of protection to survive in this harsh\r\nenvironment. Shaded and wind-sheltered, the northern side of a cinder\r\ncone can support grass, shrubs, and limber pine trees while the cone’s\r\nsouthern face supports only scattered herbs. Most cinder cones in the\r\npark show distinct differences of plant cover between their northern and\r\nsouthern exposures. Northern exposures are cooler and more moist than\r\nsouthern exposures, which receive far more direct sunlight. In addition,\r\nhere at Craters of the Moon, the prevailing southwesterly winds compound\r\nthe ability of the dry heat to rob porous cinder cone surfaces and their\r\nliving organisms of precious moisture.\r\n\r\nThe build-up of successive lava flows has so raised the landscape that\r\nit now intercepts wind currents that operate higher above surrounding\r\nplains. Limber pine trees find footholds on the shaded and sheltered\r\nnorthern exposures of cinder cones. Bitterbrush and rabbitbrush shrubs\r\nthat can barely survive on the lower skirts of a cinder cone’s southern\r\nside may grow two-thirds of the way up its protected northern face. For\r\nmany species of plants the limits of habitability on this volcanic\r\nlandscape are narrowly defined. Very small variations in their\r\nsituations can determine success or failure.\r\n\r\nTravelers often ask park rangers whether or not some of the park’s\r\nplants were planted by people. The plants in question are dwarf\r\nbuckwheats and grow in cinder gardens. It is their incredibly even\r\nspacing that creates an orderliness that is easy to mistake for human\r\ndesign. The regular spacing comes about because of the competition for\r\nmoisture, however. The root systems of these plants exploit the\r\navailable water from an area of ground surface much larger than the\r\nspread of their foliage. In this way, mature plants can fend off\r\ncompetition by using the moisture that would be required for a\r\npotentially encroaching plant to become established. The effect is an\r\neven spacing that makes it appear, indeed, as though someone had set out\r\nthe plants on measured centers.\r\n\r\nCraters of the Moon abounds with these surprising plant microhabitats\r\nthat delight explorers on foot. The bleak lava flows separate these\r\nemerging pockets of new life, isolating them like islands or oases\r\nwithin their barren volcanic surroundings.\r\n\r\nScientists have studied Carey Kipuka, an island of plantlife in the most\r\nsouthern part of the park, to find out what changes have occurred in the\r\nbiologic community. _Kipuka_ is a Hawaiian name given to an area of\r\nolder land that is surrounded by younger lava flows. Recent lava flows\r\ndid not overrun Carey Kipuka, so its plant cover is unaltered. Shortage\r\nof water protected it from livestock grazing that might have changed its\r\ncharacter. Its vegetation is a benchmark for comparing plant cover\r\nchanges on similar sites throughout southern Idaho.\r\n\r\nFor the National Park Service and other managers of wildlands,\r\nkipukas—representing isolated and pristine plant habitat unchanged by\r\nhuman influence—provide the best answer that we have to the important\r\nquestion, “What is natural?” Armed with a satisfactory answer to that\r\nquestion, it is possible to manage the land ecologically. Park managers\r\ncan seek to restore natural systems and to allow them to be as\r\nself-regulating as possible. It is ironic that Craters of the Moon, a\r\nvolcanic landscape subjected to profound change, should also protect\r\nthis informative glimpse of what remains unchanged.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _From the park’s mazes of jumbled rock, ground\r\n    squirrels fashion homes with many entrances and exits. Opportunistic\r\n    feeders on vegetable matter, these engaging rodents fall prey to\r\n    hawks and owls from above and small predatory mammals on the ground.\r\n    They therefore serve as an important transfer point between plant\r\n    and animal layers of the park’s food energy scheme._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _In the 1920s, members of the Limbert Expedition,\r\n    described on pages 50 and 51, followed the flight of doves to locate\r\n    water as they explored what later became the park._]\r\n\r\n(_continued on page 46_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Wildflowers\r\n\r\n  Wildflowers carpet Craters of the Moon’s seemingly barren lava fields\r\n  from early May to late September. The most spectacular shows of\r\n  wildflowers come with periods of precipitation. In late spring,\r\n  moisture from snowmelt—supplemented now and then by rainfall—sees the\r\n  blossoming of most of the delicate annual plants.\r\n\r\n  Many of the park’s flowering plants, having no mechanisms for\r\n  conserving moisture, simply complete their life cycles before the\r\n  middle of summer. This is particularly true of those that grow on the\r\n  porous cinder gardens into which moisture quickly descends beyond\r\n  reach of most plants’ root systems.\r\n\r\n  As summer continues and supplies of moisture slowly dwindle, only the\r\n  most drought-resistant of flowering plants continue to grow and to\r\n  bloom. With the onset of autumn rains, only the tiny yellow blossoms\r\n  of the sagebrush and rabbitbrush remain.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Blazing star_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Monkeyflower_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Desert parsley_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Wild onion_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Bitterroot_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Paintbrush_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Scabland penstemon_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Arrow-leaved balsamroot_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Scorpionweed_]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Mule Deer\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\n  Brad Griffith could be called the mule deer man. In 1980, this\r\n  wildlife researcher began a three-year study of the mule deer herd\r\n  that summers in the park. The immediate concern was that the deer,\r\n  protected inside the park, might be overpopulating their range and\r\n  endangering their habitat. Griffith set out to find out just how the\r\n  deer use the area, what their population level is, and how certain\r\n  factors—production, mortality, and distribution—affect their\r\n  population dynamics. The mule deer use the park April through November\r\n  only, because winter brings snows too deep for the deer to find food\r\n  here. The most striking finding of Griffith’s research is that the\r\n  mule deer at Craters of the Moon—unlike mule deer studied\r\n  elsewhere—have a dual summer range. Put simply, the mule deer have had\r\n  to undergo behavior modification to live here. The deer move back into\r\n  the southern park in mid-April, living in the protected wilderness\r\n  area there. While in the wilderness area, the park’s deer routinely\r\n  live up to nearly 10 miles from open water, getting their water from\r\n  food, dew, fog, and temporary puddles. This area has higher quality\r\n  forage for these deer than any other part of their annual range. The\r\n  trade-off is that the wilderness area has almost no open water. When\r\n  the moisture content of their forage decreases in summer, usually in\r\n  July, the deer move up to the northern part of the park where there is\r\n  open water. Their habits in the northern part of the park are unusual,\r\n  too, Griffith says, because there the deer live in much closer\r\n  quarters than other herds are known to tolerate on summer ranges. They\r\n  live in this wildlife equivalent of an apartment complex until the\r\n  fall rains come. Then they move back down to the wilderness area. The\r\n  deer make this unusual summer migration, Griffith suggests, to avail\r\n  themselves of the high quality forage in the southern park. “The park\r\n  serves as an island of high quality habitat for mule deer,” he wrote\r\n  in his report. It is now known the deer will leave the wilderness area\r\n  for the northern park after 12 days with daytime highs above 80°F and\r\n  nighttime lows above 50°F in summer. “We can’t really predict this,”\r\n  Park Ranger Neil King says, “but the deer know when this is.” What is\r\n  happening is that the percentage of water in their forage plants falls\r\n  below what is necessary to sustain the deer with increasingly hot\r\n  weather. As you would expect, does nursing two fawns leave a couple\r\n  days earlier than does with only one fawn. The rate at which their\r\n  fawns survive to the fall of the year is astonishing. “This is an\r\n  incredibly productive herd,” Griffith says, “right up there with the\r\n  highest fawn survival rate of any western mule deer herd.” Park\r\n  rangers continue Griffith’s studies by taking deer census counts.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {Map showing fall, summer, and spring migrations}]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The Northern Shoshone regularly passed through the\r\n    Craters of the Moon area on their annual summer migration from the\r\n    Snake River to the Camas Prairie, west of the park. They took this\r\n    journey to get out of the hot desert and into the cooler mountains.\r\n    There they could gather root crops and hunt marmots, jackrabbits,\r\n    porcupines, and ground squirrels. As they passed through today’s\r\n    park, they left behind arrowheads, choppers, and scrapers and built\r\n    stone circles that may have been used for ceremonial purposes. These\r\n    artifacts and structures are evidence the Indians were temporary\r\n    visitors to this vast volcanic landscape._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           Indians, Early Explorers And Practicing Astronauts\r\n\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, archeologists have concluded that Indians did not make\r\ntheir homes on this immense lava field. Astronauts would one day trek\r\nabout Craters of the Moon in hopes that experiencing its harshly alien\r\nenvironment would make walking on the moon less disorienting for them.\r\nNo wonder people have not chosen to live on these hot, black, sometimes\r\nsharp lava flows on which you must line the flight of doves to locate\r\ndrinking water.\r\n\r\nIndians did traverse this area on annual summer migrations, however, as\r\nshown by the developed trails and many sites where artifacts of Northern\r\nShoshone culture have been found. Most of these archeological sites are\r\nnot easily discerned by the untrained eye, but the stone windbreaks at\r\nIndian Tunnel are easily examined. Rings of rocks that may have been\r\nused for temporary shelter, hunting blinds, or religious purposes,\r\nnumerous stone tools, and the hammerstones and chippings of arrowhead\r\nmaking are found scattered throughout the lava flows. Some of the\r\nharder, dense volcanic materials found here were made into crude cutting\r\nand scraping tools and projectile points. Such evidence suggests only\r\nshort forays into the lavas for hunting or collecting by small groups.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Shoshone were a hunting and gathering culture directly\r\ndependent on what the land offered. They turned what they could of this\r\nvolcanic environment to their benefit. Before settlement by Europeans,\r\nthe vicinity of the park boasted several game species that are rare or\r\nabsent from Craters of the Moon today. These included elk, wolf, bison,\r\ngrizzly and black bear, and the cougar. Bighorn sheep, whose males sport\r\ncharacteristic headgear of large, curled horns, have been absent from\r\nthe park since about 1920.\r\n\r\nMilitary explorer U.S. Army Capt. B.L.E. Bonneville left impressions of\r\nthe Craters of the Moon lava field in his travel diaries in the early\r\n1800s. In _The Adventures of Captain Bonneville_, which were based on\r\nthe diaries, 19th-century author Washington Irving pictures a place\r\n“where nothing meets the eye but a desolate and awful waste, where no\r\ngrass grows nor water runs, and where nothing is to be seen but lava.”\r\nIrving is perhaps most famous for _The Legend of Sleepy Hollow_, but his\r\n_Adventures_ is considered a significant period work about the West and\r\nprovided this early, if brief, glimpse of a then unnamed Craters of the\r\nMoon.\r\n\r\nPioneers working westward in the 19th century sought either gold or\r\naffordable farm or ranch lands so they, like the Northern Shoshone,\r\nbypassed these lava wastes. Later, nearby settlers would venture into\r\nthis area in search of additional grazing lands. Finding none, they left\r\nCraters of the Moon substantially alone.\r\n\r\nEarly pioneers who left traces in the vicinity of the park did so by\r\nfollowing what eventually came to be known as Goodale’s Cutoff. The\r\nroute was based on Indian trails that skirted the lava fields in the\r\nnorthern section of the park. It came into use in the early 1850s as an\r\nalternate to the regular route of the Oregon Trail. Shoshone Indian\r\nhostilities along the Snake River part of the trail—one such incident is\r\nmemorialized in Idaho’s Massacre Rocks State Park—led the emigrants to\r\nsearch for a safer route. They were headed for Oregon, particularly the\r\nWalla Walla area around Whitman Mission, family groups in search of\r\nagricultural lands for settlement. Emigrants traveling it in 1854\r\nnoticed names carved in rocks and trees along its route. It was named in\r\n1862 by travelers apparently grateful to their guide, Tim Goodale, whose\r\npresence, they felt, had prevented Indian attacks. Illinois-born Goodale\r\nwas cut in the mold of the typical early trapper and trader of the Far\r\nWest. He was known to the famous fur trade brothers Solomon and William\r\nSublette. His name turned up at such fur trade locales as Pueblo, Taos,\r\nFort Bridger, and Fort Laramie over a period of at least 20 years.\r\n\r\nAfter the discovery of gold in Idaho’s Salmon River country, a party of\r\nemigrants persuaded Goodale to guide them over the route they would name\r\nfor him. Goodale was an experienced guide: in 1861, he had served in\r\nthat capacity for a military survey west of Denver. The large band of\r\nemigrants set out in July and was joined by more wagons at Craters of\r\nthe Moon. Eventually their numbers included 795 men and 300 women and\r\nchildren. Indian attacks occurred frequently along the Oregon Trail at\r\nthat time, but the size of this group evidently discouraged such\r\nincursions. The trip was not without incident, but Goodale’s reputation\r\nremained sufficiently intact for his clients to affix his name to the\r\nroute. Subsequent modifications and the addition of a ferry crossing on\r\nthe Snake River made Goodale’s Cutoff into a popular route for western\r\nemigration. Traces of it are still visible in the vicinity of the park\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nCuriosity about this uninhabitable area eventually led to more detailed\r\nknowledge of Craters of the Moon and knowledge led to its preservation.\r\nGeologists Israel C. Russell and Harold T. Stearns of the U.S.\r\nGeological Survey explored here in 1901 and 1923, respectively.\r\nTaxidermist-turned-lecturer Robert Limbert explored the area in the\r\nearly 1920s. Limbert made three trips. On the first two, he more or less\r\nretraced the steps of these geologists. On his third and most ambitious\r\ntrek, Limbert and W. L. Cole traversed what is now the park and the\r\nCraters of the Moon Wilderness Area south to north, starting from the\r\nnearby community of Minidoka. Their route took them by Two Point Butte,\r\nEcho Crater, Big Craters, North Crater Flow and out to the Old\r\nArco-Carey Road, then known as the Yellowstone Park and Lincoln Highway.\r\nThese explorations and their attendant publicity in _National Geographic\r\nMagazine_ were instrumental in the proclamation of Craters of the Moon\r\nas a national monument by President Calvin Coolidge in 1924.\r\n\r\nSince Limbert’s day, astronauts have walked both here and on the moon.\r\nDespite our now detailed knowledge of the differences between these two\r\nplaces, the name—and much of the park’s awe-inspiring appeal—remains the\r\nsame. It is as though by learning more about both these niches in our\r\nuniverse we somehow have learned more about ourselves as well.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _In the mid-1800s the Oregon Trail served as a major\r\n    route to the West for pioneers. But when hostilities developed along\r\n    the trail with the Shoshone-Bannock Indians, many of the emigrants\r\n    began using an alternate route known as Goodale’s Cutoff. This trail\r\n    went further north and passed through the present-day park\r\n    boundary._]\r\n\r\n(_continued on page 52_)\r\n\r\n\r\n               Early Explorers and the Limbert Expedition\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\n  The first known explorations of these lava fields were conducted by\r\n  two Arco, Idaho, cattlemen in 1879. Arthur Ferris and J.W. Powell were\r\n  looking for water for their livestock. The first scientific\r\n  explorations were carried out by Israel C. Russell, surveying the area\r\n  for the U.S. Geological Survey in 1901 and 1903. Beginning in 1910,\r\n  Samuel A. Paisely, later to become the park’s first custodian, also\r\n  explored these lava fields. In 1921, the U.S.G.S. sent two geologists\r\n  here, Harold T. Stearns and O.E. Meinzer, with a geologist from the\r\n  Carnegie Institute. Based on this field work, Stearns recommended that\r\n  a national monument be created here. Also during the early 20s, the\r\n  explorations of Idaho entrepreneur Robert W. Limbert caught the\r\n  public’s fancy. A report of the explorations of “Two-gun” Bob Limbert\r\n  was published in the March 1924 _National Geographic Magazine_.\r\n  Limbert was a Boise, Idaho, taxidermist, tanner, and furrier. He was\r\n  also an amateur wrestler and quick-draw artist who later performed on\r\n  the national lecture circuit. Reportedly, Limbert once challenged Al\r\n  Capone to a pistol duel at 10 paces. Evidently Capone declined.\r\n  Limbert made three treks into the lava fields between 1921 and 1924.\r\n  He first explored the more easily accessible northern portion of the\r\n  lava fields. Limbert’s third expedition crossed the area from south to\r\n  north, however, starting from Minidoka.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                The Limbert Trek\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _On his third expedition, Limbert, Cole, and a dog\r\n    traversed the lava flows from south to north. The photos that\r\n    appeared in_ The National Geographic Magazine _in 1924 were taken on\r\n    various expeditions._]\r\n\r\n  With Limbert were W.L. Cole and an Airedale terrier. Taking the dog\r\n  along was a mistake, Limbert wrote, “for after three days’ travel his\r\n  feet were worn raw and bleeding.” Limbert said it was pitiful to watch\r\n  the dog as it hobbled after them. The landscape was so unusual that\r\n  Limbert and Cole had difficulty estimating distances. Things would be\r\n  half again as far away as they had reckoned. In some areas their\r\n  compass needles went wild with magnetic distortions caused by high\r\n  concentrations of iron in the lava rock. Bizarre features they\r\n  found—such as multi-colored, blow-out craters—moved Limbert to write:\r\n  “I noticed that at places like these we had almost nothing to say.”\r\n  Limbert and Cole discovered ice caves with ice stalactites. They found\r\n  water by tracking the flights of mourning doves. They found pockets of\r\n  cold water (trapped above ground by ice deposits below the surface)\r\n  covered with yellowjackets fatally numbed by the cold. They drank the\r\n  water anyway. In desert country, said Limbert, one can’t be too picky.\r\n  Between Limbert’s lively article in the _National Geographic\r\n  Magazine_, and the reports of geologist Stearns, President Calvin\r\n  Coolidge was induced to designate part of the lava fields as Craters\r\n  of the Moon National Monument on May 2, 1924.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {untitled}]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {untitled}]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Part 3\r\n                           Guide and Adviser\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Approaching Craters of the Moon\r\n\r\n\r\n_Craters of the Moon National Monument is located in south-central\r\nIdaho’s Snake River Plain, midway between Boise, Idaho, and Grand Teton\r\nand Yellowstone National Parks.

These\r\nprograms explore such topics as the park’s wildlife and its survival,\r\nthe powers of nature, and this landscape’s volcanic origins. Some\r\nprograms are illustrated with slides or movies and take place in the\r\namphitheater.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Self-guiding Trails.\r\n\r\nExplore three representative areas of the park on self-guiding nature\r\ntrails. Devils Orchard Trail helps you understand the complex\r\nenvironmental concerns facing Craters of the Moon. A pamphlet available\r\nat the trailhead discusses the major impacts visitors, neighbors, and\r\nmanagers have on the fragile lava landscape. Numbered explanations\r\ncorrespond to markers along the trail. You can walk this trail in about\r\n20 minutes. North Crater Flow Trail takes you through a lava flow that\r\nincludes rafted blocks (crater wall fragments) and other interesting\r\nfeatures characteristic of basaltic lava flows, which are explained by\r\nwayside exhibits. This trail goes through one of the most recent lava\r\nflows in the park. The shiny lava flows made early explorers think the\r\nvolcanic eruptions had happened only a few years before. Please stay on\r\ntrails in this very fragile area. The park was established to provide\r\nprotection for its unusual landscape features. These require continuing\r\nprotection and you can help provide it. Caves Trail allows you the\r\nopportunity to explore a lava tube. These caves formed when the surface\r\nof lava flow cooled and hardened while the interior remained molten and\r\ncontinued to drain. After the lava drained away, a hollow tube remained.\r\nA pamphlet at the trailhead provides a map of the cave area and tells\r\nyou what to expect as you explore these lava tubes on your own. Wayside\r\nexhibits point out the most interesting lava formations along the trail.\r\nTo see only Indian Tunnel, the largest of the lava tubes, will require\r\nnearly one hour.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Visitors read a wayside exhibit beneath imposing\r\n    monoliths.

With several\r\nshort walks included, you can make the drive in about two hours.\r\nNumbered stops are keyed to the map in the park folder.\r\n\r\n1. Visitor Center. The 7-mile Loop Drive begins at the visitor center.\r\nMost of the drive is one-way. Spur roads and trailheads enable you to\r\nexplore this lava field even further.\r\n\r\n2. North Crater Flow. A short foot trail crosses the North Crater Flow\r\nto a group of crater wall fragments transported by lava flows. This is\r\none of the youngest flows here. The triple twist tree and its 1,350\r\ngrowth rings have in the past helped date the recency of the last flows\r\nhere. Along this trail you can see fine examples of pahoehoe lava and aa\r\nlava flows (see page 26). Just beyond the North Crater Flow Trail is the\r\nNorth Crater Trail. This short, steep, self-guiding nature trail leads\r\nyou to the vent overlooking the crater of a cinder cone.\r\n\r\n3. Devils Orchard. Devils Orchard is a group of lava fragments that\r\nstand like islands in a sea of cinders. This marks the resting place for\r\nblocks of material from the walls of North Crater that broke free and\r\nwere rafted here on lava flows. The short spur road leads to a\r\nself-guiding trail through these weird features. You can easily walk the\r\ntrail in about 20 minutes. An early morning or evening visit may allow\r\nyou to observe park wildlife. In springtime, the wildflower displays in\r\nthe cinder gardens are glorious. In June and early July, dwarf blooming\r\nmonkeyflowers give the ground a magenta cast.\r\n\r\n4. Inferno Cone Viewpoint. From the viewpoint atop Inferno Cone, a\r\nlandscape of volcanic cinder cones spreads before you to the distant\r\nmountain ranges beyond. Notice that the cooler, moister northern slopes\r\nof the cones bear noticeably more vegetation than the drier southern\r\nslopes, which receive the brunt of sunshine. If you take the short,\r\nsteep walk to the summit of Inferno Cone, you can easily recognize the\r\nchain of cinder cones that defines the Great Rift. Perhaps nowhere else\r\nin the park is it so easy to visualize how the volcanic activity broke\r\nout along this great fissure in the Earth. Towering in the distance\r\nabove the lava plain is Big Cinder Butte, one of the world’s largest,\r\npurely basaltic, cinder cones.\r\n\r\n5. Big Craters and Spatter Cones Area. Spatter cones formed along the\r\nGreat Rift fissure where clots of pasty lava stuck together when they\r\nfell. The materials and forces of these eruptions originated at depths\r\nof approximately 40 miles within the Earth. A short, steep walk to the\r\ntop of Big Craters offers a view of a series of volcanic vents.\r\n\r\n6. Trails to Tree Molds and the Wilderness Area. A spur road just beyond\r\nInferno Cone takes you to trails to the Tree Molds Area and the Craters\r\nof the Moon Wilderness. Tree molds formed where molten lava flows\r\nencased trees and then hardened (see page 27). The cylindrical molds\r\nthat remained after the wood burned and rotted away range from a few\r\ninches to more than 1 foot in diameter.\r\n\r\n7. Cave Area. At this final stop on the Loop Drive, a ½-mile walk takes\r\nyou to the lava tubes. Here you can see Dewdrop, Boy Scout, Beauty, and\r\nSurprise Caves and the Indian Tunnel. (For how these lava tubes formed,\r\nsee page 30.) Carry a flashlight in all caves except Indian Tunnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Camping and Backcountry Use\r\n\r\n\r\nThe campground has about 50 sites. These are available on a first-come,\r\nfirst-served basis. Reservations are not accepted. A daily fee for\r\ncamping is charged. Water and restrooms are provided in the campground,\r\nbut there are no showers, dump station, or hookups. Wood fires are\r\nprohibited in the park, but grills at each campsite may be used for\r\ncharcoal fires. The campground accommodates both RVs and tents. During\r\nthe summer, park rangers present evening programs at the campground\r\namphitheater.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Backcountry Use.\r\n\r\nSome of the park’s most intriguing landscapes lie beyond the road’s end\r\nin the 68-square-mile Craters of the Moon Wilderness Area. Only two\r\ntrails penetrate the wilderness, and these for only short distances.\r\nAfter the three-mile trail to Echo Crater runs out, you are on your own.\r\nFor further exploration, you can simply follow the Great Rift and its\r\nchain of cinder cones. These landmarks help you find your way.\r\n\r\nTo explore farther afield, you should have a good topographic map and\r\nbasic map skills. You can purchase such a map at the visitor center. All\r\nhikers who plan to stay overnight in the wilderness are required to\r\nregister with a park ranger. Backcountry use permits are available free\r\nat the visitor center.\r\n\r\nEach hiker should carry at least one gallon of water for each day out;\r\neven more may be necessary during the hot summer. There is no drinking\r\nwater available in the wilderness. The best times for wilderness travel\r\nare May-June and September-October. Daytime temperatures are usually\r\nmild then, while nights are cool, but you must be prepared for inclement\r\nand very cold weather in these transitional months. Summer daytime\r\ntemperatures climb into the 90s, and reflected heat off the lavas may be\r\neven higher. Long distance hiking is not very pleasant then, and the\r\nweight of necessary drinking water is burdensome.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Safety.\r\n\r\nSturdy boots and long pants are necessary gear for the jagged aa lava\r\nflows. Bring clothing for both hot and cool weather; both can occur the\r\nsame day in this desert climate. (See drinking water warning above.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Regulations.\r\n\r\nCampfires are prohibited in the backcountry. Carry a self-contained\r\nbackpack stove and fuel. Mechanized vehicles, including bicycles, are\r\nprohibited in the wilderness area. Pets are also prohibited in the\r\nwilderness. Pack out everything that you pack in—and any trash you find\r\nthat others left behind. A good admonition is: “Take only pictures, and\r\ntry not to leave so much as a footprint.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Winter Recreation\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visitor center is open every day except winter holidays. Winter\r\nhours are 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Wilderness permits, topographic maps, and\r\ninformation are available here. To find out about current snow\r\nconditions, call (208) 527-3257.\r\n\r\nSkiing. Crosscountry skiing provides an enjoyable experience of the\r\npark’s landscape transformed by snow. When heavy snows accumulate,\r\nusually in late November, the 7-mile Loop Drive is closed and it becomes\r\na natural ski trail. Most of the Loop Drive follows fairly level\r\nterrain. The best months for skiing are January to March in most\r\nwinters. Usually there is about 18 inches of snowpack by January and 3\r\nfeet by March. Temperatures range from 45°F to well below zero. Be\r\nprepared for inclement weather and high winds at all times. Blizzards\r\nmay be encountered.\r\n\r\nHazards. Skiing off the Loop Drive is allowed but not recommended. Most\r\nof the park is covered by sharp, jagged lava, and snow cover may mask\r\ncracks and caverns underneath.\r\n\r\nCamping. Winter camping is permitted in the main campground. The\r\ncampground is not plowed; be prepared to camp in the snow. Wood fires\r\nare not permitted anywhere in the park.\r\n\r\nWilderness use. The wilderness is ideal for overnight ski trips. You\r\nshould be well equipped and experienced at winter camping, however. A\r\nfree wilderness use permit, available at the visitor center, is required\r\nfor all overnight use outside the park campground.\r\n\r\n    _Both backpackers and crosscountry skiers find solitude in their\r\n    respective seasons in the park. Others may prefer ranger-led\r\n    explorations of the park’s many unusual features._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Backpackers]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Crosscountry skiers]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Ranger-led explorations]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Regulations and Safety\r\n\r\n\r\nMany management concerns, regulations, and safety tips are given under\r\nspecific subjects in this handbook. Here are some other things to\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\nPrecautions must be taken when you explore the park because of the\r\nrugged terrain, heat, and lack of naturally available drinking water.\r\nYou will need sturdy boots, a hat, and ample, leakproof water\r\ncontainers. Make sure containers are watertight before you leave home.\r\nExploring caves requires flashlights.\r\n\r\nCamp only in the park campground. All other overnight use, even in\r\nwinter, requires a wilderness use permit. A day-use permit is required\r\nto visit the area of the park that lies north of Highway 20-26-93.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Pets.\r\n\r\nPets are allowed only in the campground and on the Loop Drive, but they\r\nmust be kept on a leash at all times. Pets are prohibited in all public\r\nbuildings, on trails, or in off-road areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Vehicles.\r\n\r\nAll motor vehicles and bicycles must stay on paved roads only. They are\r\nnot allowed on trails.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Firearms.\r\n\r\nFirearm restrictions are enforced: No hunting is allowed in the park.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Collecting.\r\n\r\nThe collection, removal, or disturbance of any natural features within\r\nthe park is strictly prohibited.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _For contemporary explorers the driving tour and its\r\n    associated trails make the safest trek routes. Exercise great\r\n    caution—and close oversight of young children—at all times on your\r\n    park expeditions._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {trail}]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Nearby Attractions\r\n\r\n\r\nYellowstone National Park is world famous for its geysers and mudpots,\r\ncanyons and waterfalls, and wildlife and wilderness.
