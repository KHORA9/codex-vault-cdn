The\r\nsubject last mentioned, or \"geology proper,\" constituted originally a\r\nfourth book, now omitted, the same having been enlarged into a separate\r\ntreatise, first published in 1838, in one volume 12mo., and called \"The\r\nElements of Geology,\" afterwards recast in two volumes 12mo. in 1842,\r\nand again re-edited under the title of \"Manual of Elementary Geology,\"\r\nin one volume 8vo. in 1851. The \"Principles\" and \"Manual\" thus divided,\r\noccupy, with one exception, to which I shall presently allude, very\r\ndifferent ground. The \"Principles\" treat of such portions of the economy\r\nof existing nature, animate and inanimate, as are illustrative of\r\nGeology, so as to comprise an investigation of the permanent effects of\r\ncauses now in action, which may serve as records to after ages of the\r\npresent condition of the globe and its inhabitants. Such effects are the\r\nenduring monuments of the ever-varying state of the physical geography\r\nof the globe, the lasting signs of its destruction and renovation, and\r\nthe memorials of the equally fluctuating condition of the organic world.\r\nThey may be regarded, in short, as a symbolical language, in which the\r\nearth's autobiography is written.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Manual of Elementary Geology,\" on the other hand, I have treated\r\nbriefly of the component materials of the earth's crust, their\r\narrangement and relative position, and their organic contents, which,\r\nwhen deciphered by aid of the key supplied by the study of the modern\r\nchanges above alluded to, reveal to us the annals of a grand succession\r\nof past events--a series of revolutions which the solid exterior of the\r\nglobe, and its living inhabitants, have experienced in times antecedent\r\nto the creation of man.\r\n\r\nIn thus separating the two works, however, I have retained in the\r\n\"Principles\" (book i.) the discussion of some matters which might fairly\r\nbe regarded as common to both treatises; as for example, an historical\r\nsketch of the early progress of geology, followed by a series of\r\npreliminary essays to explain the facts and arguments which lead me to\r\nbelieve that the forces now operating upon and beneath the earth's\r\nsurface may be the same, both in kind and degree, as those which at\r\nremote epochs have worked out geological changes. (See Analysis of\r\nContents of this work, p. ix.)\r\n\r\nIf I am asked whether the \"Principles\" or the \"Manual\" should be studied\r\nfirst, I feel much the same difficulty in answering the question as if a\r\nstudent should inquire whether he ought to take up first a treatise on\r\nChemistry, or one on Natural Philosophy, subjects sufficiently distinct,\r\nyet inseparably connected. On the whole, while I have endeavored to make\r\neach of the two treatises, in their present form, quite independent of\r\nthe other, I would recommend the reader to study first the modern\r\nchanges of the earth and its inhabitants as they are discussed in the\r\npresent volume, proceeding afterwards to the classification and\r\ninterpretation of the monuments of more remote ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHARLES LYELL.\r\n\r\n   _11 Harley Street, London_, May 24, 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dates of the successive Editions of the \"Principles\" and \"Elements\" (or\r\nManual) of Geology, by the Author._\r\n\r\n  Principles, 1st vol. in octvo, published in               Jan. 1830.\r\n  ----------,  2d vol.   do.   do.

When we study history,\r\nwe obtain a more profound insight into human nature, by instituting a\r\ncomparison between the present and former states of society. We trace\r\nthe long series of events which have gradually led to the actual posture\r\nof affairs; and by connecting effects with their causes, we are enabled\r\nto classify and retain in the memory a multitude of complicated\r\nrelations--the various peculiarities of national character--the\r\ndifferent degrees of moral and intellectual refinement, and numerous\r\nother circumstances, which, without historical associations, would be\r\nuninteresting or imperfectly understood. As the present condition of\r\nnations is the result of many antecedent changes, some extremely remote,\r\nand others recent, some gradual, others sudden and violent; so the\r\nstate, of the natural world is the result of a long succession of\r\nevents; and if we would enlarge our experience of the present economy of\r\nnature, we must investigate the effects of her operations in former\r\nepochs.\r\n\r\nWe often discover with surprise, on looking back into the chronicles of\r\nnations, how the fortune of some battle has influenced the fate of\r\nmillions of our contemporaries, when it has long been forgotten by the\r\nmass of the population. With this remote event we may find inseparably\r\nconnected the geographical boundaries of a great state, the language now\r\nspoken by the inhabitants, their peculiar manners, laws, and religious\r\nopinions. But far more astonishing and unexpected are the connections\r\nbrought to light, when we carry back our researches into the history of\r\nnature. The form of a coast, the configuration of the interior of a\r\ncountry, the existence and extent of lakes, valleys, and mountains, can\r\noften be traced to the former prevalence of earthquakes and volcanoes in\r\nregions which have long been undisturbed. To these remote convulsions\r\nthe present fertility of some districts, the sterile character of\r\nothers, the elevation of land above the sea, the climate, and various\r\npeculiarities, may be distinctly referred. On the other hand, many\r\ndistinguishing features of the surface may often be ascribed to the\r\noperation, at a remote era, of slow and tranquil causes--to the gradual\r\ndeposition of sediment in a lake or in the ocean, or to the prolific\r\nincrease of testacea and corals.\r\n\r\nTo select another example, we find in certain localities subterranean\r\ndeposits of coal, consisting of vegetable matter, formerly drifted into\r\nseas and lakes. These seas and lakes have since been filled up, the\r\nlands whereon the forests grew have disappeared or changed their form,\r\nthe rivers and currents which floated the vegetable masses can no longer\r\nbe traced, and the plants belonged to species which for ages have passed\r\naway from the surface of our planet. Yet the commercial prosperity, and\r\nnumerical strength of a nation, may now be mainly dependent on the local\r\ndistribution of fuel determined by that ancient state of things.\r\n\r\nGeology is intimately related to almost all the physical sciences, as\r\nhistory is to the moral. An historian should, if possible, be at once\r\nprofoundly acquainted with ethics, politics, jurisprudence, the military\r\nart, theology; in a word, with all branches of knowledge by which any\r\ninsight into human affairs, or into the moral and intellectual nature of\r\nman, can be obtained. It would be no less desirable that a geologist\r\nshould be well versed in chemistry, natural philosophy, mineralogy,\r\nzoology, comparative anatomy, botany; in short, in every science\r\nrelating to organic and inorganic nature. With these accomplishments,\r\nthe historian and geologist would rarely fail to draw correct and\r\nphilosophical conclusions from the various monuments transmitted to them\r\nof former occurrences. They would know to what combination of causes\r\nanalogous effects were referable, and they would often be enabled to\r\nsupply, by inference, information concerning many events unrecorded in\r\nthe defective archives of former ages. But as such extensive\r\nacquisitions are scarcely within the reach of any individual, it is\r\nnecessary that men who have devoted their lives to different departments\r\nshould unite their efforts; and as the historian receives assistance\r\nfrom the antiquary, and from those who have cultivated different\r\nbranches of moral and political science, so the geologist should avail\r\nhimself of the aid of many naturalists, and particularly of those who\r\nhave studied the fossil remains of lost species of animals and plants.\r\n\r\nThe analogy, however, of the monuments consulted in geology, and those\r\navailable in history, extends no farther than to one class of historical\r\nmonuments--those which may be said to be _undesignedly_ commemorative of\r\nformer events. The canoes, for example, and stone hatchets found in our\r\npeat bogs, afford an insight into the rude arts and manners of the\r\nearliest inhabitants of our island; the buried coin fixes the date of\r\nthe reign of some Roman emperor; the ancient encampment indicates the\r\ndistricts once occupied by invading armies, and the former method of\r\nconstructing military defences; the Egyptian mummies throw light on the\r\nart of embalming, the rites of sepulture, or the average stature of the\r\nhuman race in ancient Egypt. This class of memorials yields to no other\r\nin authenticity, but it constitutes a small part only of the resources\r\non which the historian relies, whereas in geology it forms the only kind\r\nof evidence which is at our command. For this reason we must not expect\r\nto obtain a full and connected account of any series of events beyond\r\nthe reach of history. But the testimony of geological monuments, if\r\nfrequently imperfect, possesses at least the advantage of being free\r\nfrom all intentional misrepresentation. We may be deceived in the\r\ninferences which we draw, in the same manner as we often mistake the\r\nnature and import of phenomena observed in the daily course of nature;\r\nbut our liability to err is confined to the interpretation, and, if this\r\nbe correct, our information is certain.\r\n\r\nIt was long before the distinct nature and legitimate objects of geology\r\nwere fully recognized, and it was at first confounded with many other\r\nbranches of inquiry, just as the limits of history, poetry, and\r\nmythology were ill-defined in the infancy of civilization. Even in\r\nWerner's time, or at the close of the eighteenth century, geology\r\nappears to have been regarded as little other than a subordinate\r\ndepartment of mineralogy; and Desmarest included it under the head of\r\nPhysical Geography. But the most common and serious source of confusion\r\narose from the notion, that it was the business of geology to discover\r\nthe mode in which the earth originated, or, as some imagined, to study\r\nthe effects of those cosmological causes which were employed by the\r\nAuthor of Nature to bring this planet out of a nascent and chaotic state\r\ninto a more perfect and habitable condition. Hutton was the first who\r\nendeavored to draw a strong line of demarcation between his favorite\r\nscience and cosmogony, for he declared that geology was in nowise\r\nconcerned \"with questions as to the origin of things.\"\r\n\r\nAn attempt will be made in the sequel of this work to demonstrate that\r\ngeology differs as widely from cosmogony, as speculations concerning the\r\nmode of the first creation of man differ from history. But, before\r\nentering more at large on this controverted question, it will be\r\ndesirable to trace the progress of opinion on this topic, from the\r\nearliest ages to the commencement of the present century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE PROGRESS OF GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Oriental Cosmogony--Hymns of the Vedas--Institutes of\r\n     Menu--Doctrine of the successive destruction and renovation of\r\n     the world--Origin of this doctrine--Common to the\r\n     Egyptians--Adopted by the Greeks--System of Pythagoras--Of\r\n     Aristotle--Dogmas concerning the extinction and reproduction\r\n     of genera and species--Strabo's theory of elevation by\r\n     earthquakes--Pliny--Concluding Remarks on the knowledge of the\r\n     Ancients.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oriental Cosmogony._--The earliest doctrines of the Indian and Egyptian\r\nschools of philosophy agreed in ascribing the first creation of the\r\nworld to an omnipotent and infinite Being. They concurred also in\r\nrepresenting this Being, who had existed from all eternity, as having\r\nrepeatedly destroyed and reproduced the world and all its inhabitants.\r\nIn the sacred volume of the Hindoos, called the Ordinances of Menu,\r\ncomprising the Indian system of duties religious and civil, we find a\r\npreliminary chapter treating of the Creation, in which the cosmogony is\r\nknown to have been derived from earlier writings and traditions; and\r\nprincipally from certain hymns of high antiquity, called the Vedas.\r\nThese hymns were first put together, according to Mr. Colebrooke,[1] in\r\na connected series, about thirteen centuries before the Christian era,\r\nbut they appear from internal evidence to have been written at various\r\nantecedent periods. In them, as we learn from the researches of\r\nProfessor Wilson, the eminent Sanscrit scholar, two distinct\r\nphilosophical systems are discoverable. According to one of them, all\r\nthings were originally brought into existence by the sole will of a\r\nsingle First Cause, which existed from eternity; according to the other,\r\nthere have always existed two principles, the one material, but without\r\nform, the other spiritual and capable of compelling \"inert matter to\r\ndevelop its sensible properties.\" This development of matter into\r\n\"individual and visible existences\" is called creation, and is assigned\r\nto a subordinate agent, or the creative faculty of the Supreme Being\r\nembodied in the person of Brahma.\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter of the Ordinances of Menu above alluded to, we meet\r\nwith the following passages relating to former destructions and\r\nrenovations of the world:--\r\n\r\n\"The Being, whose powers are incomprehensible, having created me (Menu)\r\nand this universe, again became absorbed in the supreme spirit, changing\r\nthe time of energy for the hour of repose.\r\n\r\n\"When that Power awakes, then has this world its full expansion; but\r\nwhen he slumbers with a tranquil spirit, then the whole system fades\r\naway..... For while he reposes, as it were, embodied spirits endowed\r\nwith principles of action depart from their several acts, and the mind\r\nitself becomes inert.\"\r\n\r\nThe absorption of all beings into the Supreme essence is then described,\r\nand the Divine soul itself is said to slumber, and to remain for a time\r\nimmersed in \"the first idea, or in darkness.\" After which the text thus\r\nproceeds (verse fifty-seven), \"Thus that immutable power by waking and\r\nreposing alternately, revivifies and destroys, in eternal succession,\r\nthis whole assemblage of locomotive and immovable creatures.\"\r\n\r\nIt is then declared that there has been a long succession of\r\n_manwantaras_, or periods, each of the duration of many thousand ages,\r\nand--\r\n\r\n\"There are creations also, and destructions of worlds innumerable: the\r\nBeing, supremely exalted, performs all this with as much ease as if in\r\nsport, again and again, for the sake of conferring happiness.\"[2]\r\n\r\nNo part of the Eastern cosmogony, from which these extracts are made, is\r\nmore interesting to the geologist than the doctrine, so frequently\r\nalluded to, of the reiterated submersion of the land beneath the waters\r\nof a universal ocean. In the beginning of things, we are told, the First\r\nSole Cause \"with a thought created the waters,\" and then moved upon\r\ntheir surface in the form of Brahma the creator, by whose agency the\r\nemergence of the dry land was effected, and the peopling of the earth\r\nwith plants, animals, celestial creatures, and man. Afterwards, as often\r\nas a general conflagration at the close of each manwantara had\r\nannihilated every visible and existing thing, Brahma, on awaking from\r\nhis sleep, finds the whole world a shapeless ocean. Accordingly, in the\r\nlegendary poems called the Puranas, composed at a later date than the\r\nVedas, the three first Avatars or descents of the Deity upon earth have\r\nfor their object to recover the land from the waters. For this purpose\r\nVishnu is made successively to assume the form of a fish, a tortoise,\r\nand a boar.\r\n\r\nExtravagant as may be some of the conceits and fictions which disfigure\r\nthese pretended revelations, we can by no means look upon them as a pure\r\neffort of the unassisted imagination, or believe them to have been\r\ncomposed without regard to opinions and theories founded on the\r\nobservation of Nature. In astronomy, for instance, it is declared that,\r\nat the North Pole, the year was divided into a long day and night, and\r\nthat their long day was the northern, and their night the southern\r\ncourse of the sun; and to the inhabitants of the moon, it is said one\r\nday is equal in length to one month of mortals.[3] If such statements\r\ncannot be resolved into mere conjectures, we have no right to refer to\r\nmere chance the prevailing notion that the earth and its inhabitants had\r\nformerly undergone a succession of revolutions and aqueous catastrophes\r\ninterrupted by long intervals of tranquillity.\r\n\r\nNow there are two sources in which such a theory may have originated.\r\nThe marks of former convulsions on every part of the surface of our\r\nplanet are obvious and striking. The remains of marine animals imbedded\r\nin the solid strata are so abundant, that they may be expected to force\r\nthemselves on the attention of every people who have made some progress\r\nin refinement; and especially where one class of men are expressly set\r\napart from the rest, like the ancient priesthoods of India and Egypt,\r\nfor study and contemplation. If these appearances are once recognized,\r\nit seems natural that the mind should conclude in favor, not only of\r\nmighty changes in past ages, but of alternate periods of repose and\r\ndisorder;--of repose, when the animals now fossil lived, grew, and\r\nmultiplied--of disorder, when the strata in which they were buried\r\nbecame transferred from the sea to the interior of continents, and were\r\nuplifted so as to form part of high mountain-chains. Those modern\r\nwriters, who are disposed to disparage the former intellectual\r\nadvancement and civilization of Eastern nations, may concede some\r\nfoundation of observed facts for the curious theories now under\r\nconsideration, without indulging in exaggerated opinions of the progress\r\nof science; especially as universal catastrophes of the world, and\r\nexterminations of organic beings, in the sense in which they were\r\nunderstood by the Brahmins, are untenable doctrines.\r\n\r\nWe know that the Egyptian priests were aware, not only that the soil\r\nbeneath the plains of the Nile, but that also the hills bounding the\r\ngreat valley, contained marine shells; and Herodotus inferred from these\r\nfacts, that all lower Egypt, and even the high lands above Memphis, had\r\nonce been covered by the sea.[4] As similar fossil remains occur in all\r\nparts of Asia hitherto explored, far in the interior of the continent as\r\nwell as near the sea, they could hardly have escaped detection by some\r\nEastern sages not less capable than the Greek historian of reasoning\r\nphilosophically on natural phenomena.\r\n\r\nWe also know that the rulers of Asia were engaged in very remote eras in\r\nexecuting great national works, such as tanks and canals, requiring\r\nextensive excavations. In the fourteenth century of our era (in the year\r\n1360), the removal of soil necessary for such undertakings brought to\r\nlight geological facts, which attracted the attention of a people less\r\ncivilized than were many of the older nations of the East. The historian\r\nFerishta relates that fifty thousand laborers were employed in cutting\r\nthrough a mound, so as to form a junction between the rivers Selima and\r\nSutlej; and in this mound were found the bones of elephants and men,\r\nsome of them petrified, and some of them resembling bone. The gigantic\r\ndimensions attributed to the human bones show them to have belonged to\r\nsome of the larger pachydermata.[5]\r\n\r\nBut, although the Brahmins, like the priests of Egypt, may have been\r\nacquainted with the existence of fossil remains in the strata, it is\r\npossible that the doctrine of successive destructions and renovations of\r\nthe world, merely received corroboration from such proofs; and that it\r\nmay have been originally handed down, like the religious traditions of\r\nmost nations, from a ruder state of society. The system may have had its\r\nsource, in part at least, in exaggerated accounts of those dreadful\r\ncatastrophes which are occasioned by particular combinations of natural\r\ncauses. Floods and volcanic eruptions, the agency of water and fire, are\r\nthe chief instruments of devastation on our globe. We shall point out in\r\nthe sequel the extent of many of these calamities, recurring at distant\r\nintervals of time, in the present course of nature; and shall only\r\nobserve here, that they are so peculiarly calculated to inspire a\r\nlasting terror, and are so often fatal in their consequences to great\r\nmultitudes of people, that it scarcely requires the passion for the\r\nmarvellous, so characteristic of rude and half-civilized nations, still\r\nless the exuberant imagination of Eastern writers, to augment them into\r\ngeneral cataclysms and conflagrations.\r\n\r\nThe great flood of the Chinese, which their traditions carry back to the\r\nperiod of Yaou, something more than 2000 years before our era, has been\r\nidentified by some persons with the universal deluge described in the\r\nOld Testament; but according to Mr. Davis, who accompanied two of our\r\nembassies to China, and who has carefully examined their written\r\naccounts, the Chinese cataclysm is therein described as interrupting the\r\nbusiness of agriculture, rather than as involving a general destruction\r\nof the human race. The great Yu was celebrated for having \"opened nine\r\nchannels to draw off the waters,\" which \"covered the low hills and\r\nbathed the foot of the highest mountains.\" Mr. Davis suggests that a\r\ngreat derangement of waters of the Yellow River, one of the largest in\r\nthe world, might even now cause the flood of Yaou to be repeated, and\r\nlay the most fertile and populous plains of China under water. In modern\r\ntimes the bursting of the banks of an artificial canal, into which a\r\nportion of the Yellow River has been turned, has repeatedly given rise\r\nto the most dreadful accidents, and is a source of perpetual anxiety to\r\nthe government. It is easy, therefore, to imagine how much greater may\r\nhave been the inundation, if this valley was ever convulsed by a violent\r\nearthquake.[6]\r\n\r\nHumboldt relates the interesting fact that, after the annihilation of a\r\nlarge part of the inhabitants of Cumana, by an earthquake in 1766, a\r\nseason of extraordinary fertility ensued, in consequence of the great\r\nrains which accompanied the subterranean convulsions. \"The Indians,\" he\r\nsays, \"celebrated, after the ideas of an antique superstition, by\r\nfestivals and dancing, the destruction of the world and the approaching\r\nepoch of its regeneration.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThe existence of such rites among the rude nations of South America is\r\nmost important, as showing what effects may be produced by local\r\ncatastrophes, recurring at distant intervals of time, on the minds of a\r\nbarbarous and uncultivated race. I shall point out in the sequel how the\r\ntradition of a deluge among the Araucanian Indians may be explained, by\r\nreference to great earthquake-waves which have repeatedly rolled over\r\npart of Chili since the first recorded flood of 1590. (See chap. 29,\r\nBook II.) The legend also of the ancient Peruvians of an inundation many\r\nyears before the reign of the Incas, in which only six persons were\r\nsaved on a float, relates to a region which has more than once been\r\noverwhelmed by inroads of the ocean since the days of Pizarro. (Chap.\r\n29, Book II.) I might refer the reader to my account of the submergence\r\nof a wide area in Cutch so lately as the year 1819, when a single tower\r\nonly of the fort of Sindree appeared above the waste of waters (see\r\nChap. 28, Book II.), if it were necessary, to prove how easily the\r\ncatastrophes of modern times might give rise to traditionary narratives,\r\namong a rude people, of floods of boundless extent. Nations without\r\nwritten records, and who are indebted for all their knowledge of past\r\nevents exclusively to oral tradition, are in the habit of confounding in\r\none legend a series of incidents which have happened at various epochs;\r\nnor must we forget that the superstitions of a savage tribe are\r\ntransmitted through all the progressive stages of society, till they\r\nexert a powerful influence on the mind of the philosopher. He may find,\r\nin the monuments of former changes on the earth's surface, an apparent\r\nconfirmation of tenets handed down through successive generations, from\r\nthe rude hunter, whose terrified imagination drew a false picture of\r\nthose awful visitations of floods and earthquakes, whereby the whole\r\nearth as known to him was simultaneously devastated.\r\n\r\n_Egyptian Cosmogony._--Respecting the cosmogony of the Egyptian priests,\r\nwe gather much information from writers of the Grecian sects, who\r\nborrowed almost all their tenets from Egypt, and amongst others that of\r\nthe former successive destruction and renovation of the world.[8] We\r\nlearn from Plutarch, that this was the theme of one of the hymns of\r\nOrpheus, so celebrated in the fabulous ages of Greece. It was brought by\r\nhim from the banks of the Nile; and we even find in his verses, as in\r\nthe Indian systems, a definite period assigned for the duration of each\r\nsuccessive world.[9] The returns of great catastrophes were determined\r\nby the period of the Annus Magnus, or great year,--a cycle composed of\r\nthe revolutions of the sun, moon, and planets, and terminating when\r\nthese return together to the same sign whence they were supposed at some\r\nremote epoch to have set out. The duration of this great cycle was\r\nvariously estimated. According to Orpheus, it was 120,000 years;\r\naccording to others, 300,000; and by Cassander it was taken to be\r\n360,000 years.[10]\r\n\r\nWe learn particularly from the Timaeus of Plato, that the Egyptians\r\nbelieved the world to be subject to occasional conflagrations and\r\ndeluges, whereby the gods arrested the career of human wickedness, and\r\npurified the earth from guilt. After each regeneration, mankind were in\r\na state of virtue and happiness, from which they gradually degenerated\r\nagain into vice and immorality. From this Egyptian doctrine, the poets\r\nderived the fable of the decline from the golden to the iron age. The\r\nsect of Stoics adopted most fully the system of catastrophes destined at\r\ncertain intervals to destroy the world. Those they taught were of two\r\nkinds;--the Cataclysm, or destruction by water, which sweeps away the\r\nwhole human race, and annihilates all the animal and vegetable\r\nproductions of nature; and the Ecpyrosis, or destruction by fire, which\r\ndissolves the globe itself. From the Egyptians also they derived the\r\ndoctrine of the gradual debasement of man from a state of innocence.\r\nTowards the termination of each era, the gods could no longer bear with\r\nthe wickedness of men, and a shock of the elements or a deluge\r\noverwhelmed them; after which calamity, Astrea again descended on the\r\nearth to renew the golden age.[11]\r\n\r\nThe connection between the doctrine of successive catastrophes and\r\nrepeated deteriorations in the moral character of the human race is more\r\nintimate and natural than might at first be imagined. For, in a rude\r\nstate of society, all great calamities are regarded by the people as\r\njudgments of God on the wickedness of man. Thus, in our own time, the\r\npriests persuaded a large part of the population of Chili, and perhaps\r\nbelieved themselves, that the fatal earthquake of 1822 was a sign of the\r\nwrath of Heaven for the great political revolution just then consummated\r\nin South America. In like manner, in the account given to Solon by the\r\nEgyptian priests, of the submersion of the island of Atlantis under the\r\nwaters of the ocean, after repeated shocks of an earthquake, we find\r\nthat the event happened when Jupiter had seen the moral depravity of the\r\ninhabitants.[12] Now, when the notion had once gained ground, whether\r\nfrom causes before suggested or not, that the earth had been destroyed\r\nby several general catastrophes, it would next be inferred that the\r\nhuman race had been as often destroyed and renovated. And since every\r\nextermination was assumed to be penal, it could only be reconciled with\r\ndivine justice, by the supposition that man, at each successive\r\ncreation, was regenerated in a state of purity and innocence.\r\n\r\nA very large portion of Asia, inhabited by the earliest nations, whose\r\ntraditions have come down to us, has been always subject to tremendous\r\nearthquakes. Of the geographical boundaries of these, and their effects,\r\nI shall speak in the proper place. Egypt has, for the most part, been\r\nexempt from this scourge, and the Egyptian doctrine of great\r\ncatastrophes was probably derived in part, as before hinted, from early\r\ngeological observations, and in part from Eastern nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pythagorean Doctrines._--Pythagoras, who resided for more than twenty\r\nyears in Egypt, and, according to Cicero, had visited the East, and\r\nconversed with the Persian philosophers, introduced into his own\r\ncountry, on his return, the doctrine of the gradual deterioration of the\r\nhuman race from an original state of virtue and happiness; but if we are\r\nto judge of his theory concerning the destruction and renovation of the\r\nearth from the sketch given by Ovid, we must concede it to have been far\r\nmore philosophical than any known version of the cosmogonies of Oriental\r\nor Egyptian sects.\r\n\r\nAlthough Pythagoras is introduced by the poet as delivering his doctrine\r\nin person, some of the illustrations are derived from natural events\r\nwhich happened after the death of the philosopher. But notwithstanding\r\nthese anachronisms, we may regard the account as a true picture of the\r\ntenets of the Pythagorean school in the Augustan age; and although\r\nperhaps partially modified, it must have contained the substance of the\r\noriginal scheme. Thus considered, it is extremely curious and\r\ninstructive; for we here find a comprehensive summary of almost all the\r\ngreat causes of change now in activity on the globe, and these adduced\r\nin confirmation of a principle of a perpetual and gradual revolution\r\ninherent in the nature of our terrestrial system. These doctrines, it is\r\ntrue, are not directly applied to the explanation of geological\r\nphenomena; or, in other words, no attempt is made to estimate what may\r\nhave been in past ages, or what may hereafter be, the aggregate amount\r\nof change brought about by such never-ending fluctuations. Had this been\r\nthe case, we might have been called upon to admire so extraordinary an\r\nanticipation with no less interest than astronomers, when they endeavor\r\nto define by what means the Samian philosopher came to the knowledge of\r\nthe Copernican system.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the celebrated passages to which we have been\r\nadverting:[13]\r\n\r\n\"Nothing perishes in this world; but things merely vary and change their\r\nform. To be born, means simply that a thing begins to be something\r\ndifferent from what it was before; and dying, is ceasing to be the same\r\nthing. Yet, although nothing retains long the same image, the sum of the\r\nwhole remains constant.\" These general propositions are then confirmed\r\nby a series of examples, all derived from natural appearances, except\r\nthe first, which refers to the golden age giving place to the age of\r\niron. The illustrations are thus consecutively adduced.\r\n\r\n1. Solid land has been converted into sea.\r\n\r\n2. Sea has been changed into land. Marine shells lie far distant from\r\nthe deep, and the anchor has been found on the summit of hills.\r\n\r\n3. Valleys have been excavated by running water, and floods have washed\r\ndown hills into the sea.[14]\r\n\r\n4. Marshes have become dry ground.\r\n\r\n5. Dry lands have been changed into stagnant pools.\r\n\r\n6. During earthquakes some springs have been closed up, and new ones\r\nhave broken out. Rivers have deserted their channels, and have been\r\nre-born elsewhere, as the Erasinus in Greece, and Mysus in Asia.\r\n\r\n7. The waters of some rivers, formerly sweet, have become bitter; as\r\nthose of the Anigris, in Greece, &c.[15]\r\n\r\n8. Islands have become connected with the mainland by the growth of\r\ndeltas and new deposits; as in the case of Antissa joined to Lesbos,\r\nPharos to Egypt, &c.\r\n\r\n9. Peninsulas have been divided from the main land, and have become\r\nislands, as Leucadia; and according to tradition, Sicily, the sea having\r\ncarried away the isthmus.\r\n\r\n10. Land has been submerged by earthquakes; the Grecian cities of Helice\r\nand Buris, for example, are to be seen under the sea, with their walls\r\ninclined.\r\n\r\n11. Plains have been upheaved into hills by the confined air seeking\r\nvent; as at Troezene in the Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\n12. The temperature of some springs varies at different periods. The\r\nwaters of others are inflammable.[16]\r\n\r\n13. There are streams which have a petrifying power, and convert the\r\nsubstances which they touch into marble.\r\n\r\n14. Extraordinary medicinal and deleterious effects are produced by the\r\nwater of different lakes and springs.[17]\r\n\r\n15. Some rocks and islands, after floating and having been subject to\r\nviolent movements, have at length become stationary and immovable; as\r\nDelos and the Cyanean Isles.[18]\r\n\r\n16. Volcanic vents shift their position; there was a time when Etna was\r\nnot a burning mountain, and the time will come when it will cease to\r\nburn. Whether it be that some caverns become closed up by the movements\r\nof the earth, and others opened, or whether the fuel is finally\r\nexhausted, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nThe various causes of change in the inanimate world having been thus\r\nenumerated, the doctrine of equivocal generation is next propounded, as\r\nillustrating a corresponding perpetual flux in the animate creation.[19]\r\n\r\nIn the Egyptian and Eastern cosmogonies, and in the Greek version of\r\nthem, no very definite meaning can, in general, be attached to the term\r\n\"destruction of the world;\" for sometimes it would seem almost to imply\r\nthe annihilation of our planetary system, and at others a mere\r\nrevolution of the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\n_Opinions of Aristotle._--From the works now extant of Aristotle, and\r\nfrom the system of Pythagoras, as above exposed, we might certainly\r\ninfer that these philosophers considered the agents of change now\r\noperating in nature, as capable of bringing about in the lapse of ages a\r\ncomplete revolution; and the Stagyrite even considers occasional\r\ncatastrophes, happening at distant intervals of time, as part of the\r\nregular and ordinary course of nature. The deluge of Deucalion, he says,\r\naffected Greece only, and principally the part called Hellas, and it\r\narose from great inundations of rivers, during a rainy winter. But such\r\nextraordinary winters, he says, though after a certain period they\r\nreturn, do not always revisit the same places.[20]\r\n\r\nCensorinus quotes it as Aristotle's opinion that there were general\r\ninundations of the globe, and that they alternated with conflagrations;\r\nand that the flood constituted the winter of the great year, or\r\nastronomical cycle, while the conflagration, or destruction by fire, is\r\nthe summer, or period of greatest heat.[21] If this passage, as Lipsius\r\nsupposes, be an amplification, by Censorinus, of what is written in \"the\r\nMeteorics,\" it is a gross misrepresentation of the doctrine of the\r\nStagyrite, for the general bearing of his reasoning in that treatise\r\ntends clearly in an opposite direction. He refers to many examples of\r\nchanges now constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great\r\nresults which they must produce in the lapse of ages. He instances\r\nparticular cases of lakes that had dried up, and deserts that had at\r\nlength become watered by rivers and fertilized. He points to the growth\r\nof the Nilotic Delta since the time of Homer, to the shallowing of the\r\nPalus Maeotis within sixty years from his own time; and although, in the\r\nsame chapter he says nothing of earthquakes, yet in others of the same\r\ntreatise he shows himself not unacquainted with their effects.[22] He\r\nalludes, for example, to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands\r\nprevious to a volcanic eruption. \"The changes of the earth,\" he says,\r\n\"are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives, that they are\r\noverlooked ([Greek: lanthanei]): and the migrations of people after\r\ngreat catastrophes, and their removal to other regions, cause the event\r\nto be forgotten.\"[23]\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the acquaintance displayed by Aristotle, in his\r\nvarious works, with the destroying and renovating powers of Nature, the\r\nintroductory and concluding passages of the twelfth chapter of his\r\n\"Meteorics\" are certainly very remarkable. In the first sentence he\r\nsays, \"The distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not\r\nendure throughout all time, but it becomes sea in those parts where it\r\nwas land, and again it becomes land where it was sea: and there is\r\nreason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain\r\nsystem, and within a certain period.\" The concluding observation is as\r\nfollows:--\"As time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither the\r\nTanais, nor the Nile, can have flowed forever. The places where they\r\nrise were once dry, and there is a limit to their operations; but there\r\nis none to time. So also of all other rivers; they spring up, and they\r\nperish; and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades\r\nothers. The same tracts, therefore, of the earth are not, some always\r\nsea, and others always continents, but every thing changes in the course\r\nof time.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems, then, that the Greeks had not only derived from preceding\r\nnations, but had also, in some slight degree, deduced from their own\r\nobservations, the theory of periodical revolutions in the inorganic\r\nworld: there is, however, no ground for imagining that they contemplated\r\nformer changes in the races of animals and plants. Even the fact that\r\nmarine remains were inclosed in solid rocks, although observed by some,\r\nand even made the groundwork of geological speculation, never stimulated\r\nthe industry or guided the inquiries of naturalists. It is not\r\nimpossible that the theory of equivocal generation might have engendered\r\nsome indifference on this subject, and that a belief in the spontaneous\r\nproduction of living beings from the earth or corrupt matter, might have\r\ncaused the organic world to appear so unstable and fluctuating, that\r\nphenomena indicative of former changes would not awaken intense\r\ncuriosity. The Egyptians, it is true, had taught, and the Stoics had\r\nrepeated, that the earth had once given birth to some monstrous animals,\r\nwhich existed no longer; but the prevailing opinion seems to have been,\r\nthat after each great catastrophe the same species of animals were\r\ncreated over again. This tenet is implied in a passage of Seneca, where,\r\nspeaking of a future deluge, he says, \"Every animal shall be generated\r\nanew, and man free from guilt shall be given to the earth.\"[24]\r\n\r\nAn old Arabian version of the doctrine of the successive revolutions of\r\nthe globe, translated by Abraham Ecchellensis,[25] seems to form a\r\nsingular exception to the general rule, for here we find the idea of\r\ndifferent genera and species having been created. The Gerbanites, a sect\r\nof astronomers who flourished some centuries before the Christian era,\r\ntaught as follows:--\"That after every period of thirty-six thousand four\r\nhundred and twenty-five years, there were produced a pair of _every_\r\nspecies of animal, both male and female, from whom animals might be\r\npropagated and inhabit this lower world. But when a circulation of the\r\nheavenly orbs was completed, which is finished in that space of years,\r\n_other genera and species_ of animals are propagated, as also of plants\r\nand other things, and the first order is destroyed, and so it goes on\r\nforever and ever.\"[26]\r\n\r\n_Theory of Strabo._--As we learn much of the tenets of the Egyptian and\r\nOriental schools in the writings of the Greeks, so, many speculations of\r\nthe early Greek authors are made known to us in the works of the\r\nAugustan and later ages. Strabo, in particular, enters largely, in the\r\nsecond book of his Geography, into the opinions of Eratosthenes and\r\nother Greeks on one of the most difficult problems in geology, viz., by\r\nwhat causes marine shells came to be plentifully buried in the earth at\r\nsuch great elevations and distances from the sea.\r\n\r\nHe notices, amongst others, the explanation of Xanthus the Lydian, who\r\nsaid that the seas had once been more extensive, and that they had\r\nafterwards been partially dried up, as in his own time many lakes,\r\nrivers, and wells in Asia had failed during a season of drought.\r\nTreating this conjecture with merited disregard, Strabo passes on to the\r\nhypothesis of Strato, the natural philosopher, who had observed that the\r\nquantity of mud brought down by rivers into the Euxine was so great,\r\nthat its bed must be gradually raised, while the rivers still continue\r\nto pour in an undiminished quantity of water. He, therefore, conceived\r\nthat, originally, when the Euxine was an inland sea, its level had by\r\nthis means become so much elevated that it burst its barrier near\r\nByzantium, and formed a communication with the Propontis; and this\r\npartial drainage, he supposed, had already converted the left side into\r\nmarshy ground, and thus, at last, the whole would be choked up with\r\nsoil. So, it was argued, the Mediterranean had once opened a passage for\r\nitself by the Columns of Hercules into the Atlantic; and perhaps the\r\nabundance of sea-shells in Africa, near the Temple of Jupiter Ammon,\r\nmight also be the deposit of some former inland sea, which had at length\r\nforced a passage and escaped.\r\n\r\nBut Strabo rejects this theory, as insufficient to account for all the\r\nphenomena, and he proposes one of his own, the profoundness of which\r\nmodern geologists are only beginning to appreciate. \"It is not,\" he\r\nsays, \"because the lands covered by seas were originally at different\r\naltitudes, that the waters have risen, or subsided, or receded from some\r\nparts and inundated others. But the reason is, that the same land is\r\nsometimes raised up and sometimes depressed, and the sea also is\r\nsimultaneously raised and depressed, so that it either overflows or\r\nreturns into its own place again. We must, therefore, ascribe the cause\r\nto the ground, either to that ground which is under the sea, or to that\r\nwhich becomes flooded by it, but rather to that which lies beneath the\r\nsea, for this is more movable and, on account of its humidity, can be\r\naltered with greater celerity.[27] \"_It is proper_,\" he observes in\r\ncontinuation, \"_to derive our explanations from things which are\r\nobvious, and in some measure of daily occurrence, such as deluges,\r\nearthquakes, and volcanic eruptions,[28] and sudden swellings of the\r\nland beneath the sea_; for the last raise up the sea also; and when the\r\nsame lands subside again, they occasion the sea to be let down. And it\r\nis not merely the small, but the large islands also, and not merely the\r\nislands, but the continents which can be lifted up together with the\r\nsea; and both large and small tracts may subside, for habitations and\r\ncities, like Bure, Bizona, and many others, have been engulphed by\r\nearthquakes.\"\r\n\r\nIn another place, this learned geographer, in alluding to the tradition\r\nthat Sicily had been separated by a convulsion from Italy, remarks, that\r\nat present the land near the sea in those parts was rarely shaken by\r\nearthquakes, since there were now open orifices whereby fire and ignited\r\nmatters, and waters escape; but formerly, when the volcanoes of Etna,\r\nthe Lipari Islands, Ischia, and others, were closed up, the imprisoned\r\nfire and wind might have produced far more vehement movements.[29] The\r\ndoctrine, therefore, that volcanoes are safety-valves, and that the\r\nsubterranean convulsions are probably most violent when first the\r\nvolcanic energy shifts itself to a new quarter, is not modern.\r\n\r\nWe learn from a passage in Strabo,[30] that it was a dogma of the\r\nGaulish Druids that the universe was immortal, but destined to survive\r\ncatastrophes both of fire and water. That this doctrine was communicated\r\nto them from the East, with much of their learning, cannot be doubted.\r\nCaesar, it will be remembered, says that they made use of Greek letters\r\nin arithmetical computations.[31]\r\n\r\n_Pliny._--This philosopher had no theoretical opinions of his own\r\nconcerning changes of the earth's surface; and in this department, as in\r\nothers, he restricted himself to the task of a compiler, without\r\nreasoning on the facts stated by him, or attempting to digest them into\r\nregular order. But his enumeration of the new islands which had been\r\nformed in the Mediterranean, and of other convulsions, shows that the\r\nancients had not been inattentive observers of the changes which had\r\ntaken place within the memory of man.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, appear to have been the opinions entertained before the\r\nChristian era, concerning the past revolutions of our globe. Although no\r\nparticular investigations had been made for the express purpose of\r\ninterpreting the monuments of ancient changes, they were too obvious to\r\nbe entirely disregarded; and the observation of the present course of\r\nnature presented too many proofs of alterations continually in progress\r\non the earth to allow philosophers to believe that nature was in a state\r\nof rest, or that the surface had remained, and would continue to remain\r\nunaltered. But they had never compared attentively the results of the\r\ndestroying and reproductive operations of modern times with those of\r\nremote eras, nor had they ever entertained so much as a conjecture\r\nconcerning the comparative antiquity of the human race, or of living\r\nspecies of animals and plants, with those belonging to former conditions\r\nof the organic world. They had studied the movements and positions of\r\nthe heavenly bodies with laborious industry, and made some progress in\r\ninvestigating the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms; but the\r\nancient history of the globe was to them a sealed book, and, although\r\nwritten in characters of the most striking and imposing kind, they were\r\nunconscious even of its existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE PROGRESS OF GEOLOGY--_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Arabian writers of the tenth century--Avicenna--Omar--Cosmogony\r\n    of the Koran--Kazwini--Early Italian writers--Leonardo da\r\n    Vinci--Fracastoro--Controversy as to the real nature of\r\n    fossils--Attributed to the Mosaic deluge--Palissy--Steno\r\n    --Scilla--Quirini--Boyle--Lister--Leibnitz--Hooke's\r\n    Theory of Elevation by Earthquakes--Of lost species of\r\n    animals--Ray--Physico-theological writers--Woodward's Diluvial\r\n    Theory--Burnet--Whiston--Vallisneri--Lazzaro\r\n    Moro--Generelli--Buffon--His theory condemned by the Sorbonne\r\n    as unorthodox--His declaration--Targioni--Arduino--Michell\r\n    --Catcott--Raspe Fuchsel--Fortis--Testa--Whitehurst--Pallas\r\n    --Saussure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arabian writers._--After the decline of the Roman empire, the\r\ncultivation of physical science was first revived with some success by\r\nthe Saracens, about the middle of the eighth century of our era. The\r\nworks of the most eminent classic writers were purchased at great\r\nexpense from the Christians, and translated into Arabic; and Al Mamun,\r\nson of the famous Harun-al-Rashid, the contemporary of Charlemagne,\r\nreceived with marks of distinction, at his court at Bagdad, astronomers\r\nand men of learning from different countries. This caliph, and some of\r\nhis successors, encountered much opposition and jealousy from the\r\ndoctors of the Mahometan law, who wished the Moslems to confine their\r\nstudies to the Koran, dreading the effects of the diffusion of a taste\r\nfor the physical sciences.[32]\r\n\r\n_Avicenna._--Almost all the works of the early Arabian writers are lost.\r\nAmongst those of the tenth century, of which fragments are now extant,\r\nis a short treatise, \"On the Formation and Classification of Minerals,\"\r\nby Avicenna, a physician, in whose arrangement there is considerable\r\nmerit. The second chapter, \"On the Cause of Mountains,\" is remarkable;\r\nfor mountains, he says, are formed, some by essential, others by\r\naccidental causes. In illustration of the essential, he instances \"a\r\nviolent earthquake, by which land is elevated, and becomes a mountain;\"\r\nof the accidental, the principal, he says, is excavation by water,\r\nwhereby cavities are produced, and adjoining lands made to stand out and\r\nform eminences.[33]\r\n\r\n_Omar--Cosmogony of the Koran._--In the same century, also, Omar,\r\nsurnamed \"El Aalem,\" or \"The Learned,\" wrote a work on \"The Retreat of\r\nthe Sea.\" It appears that on comparing the charts of his own time with\r\nthose made by the Indian and Persian astronomers two thousand years\r\nbefore, he had satisfied himself that important changes had taken place\r\nsince the times of history in the form of the coasts of Asia, and that\r\nthe extension of the sea had been greater at some former periods. He was\r\nconfirmed in this opinion by the numerous salt springs and marshes in\r\nthe interior of Asia,--a phenomenon from which Pallas, in more recent\r\ntimes, has drawn the same inference.\r\n\r\nVon Hoff has suggested, with great probability, that the changes in the\r\nlevel of the Caspian (some of which there is reason to believe have\r\nhappened within the historical era), and the geological appearances in\r\nthat district, indicating the desertion by that sea of its ancient bed,\r\nhad probably led Omar to his theory of a general subsidence. But\r\nwhatever may have been the proofs relied on, his system was declared\r\ncontradictory to certain passages in the Koran, and he was called upon\r\npublicly to recant his errors; to avoid which persecution he went into\r\nvoluntary banishment from Samarkand.[34]\r\n\r\nThe cosmological opinions expressed in the Koran are few, and merely\r\nintroduced incidentally: so that it is not easy to understand how they\r\ncould have interfered so seriously with free discussion on the former\r\nchanges of the globe. The Prophet declares that the earth was created in\r\ntwo days, and the mountains were then placed on it; and during these,\r\nand two additional days, the inhabitants of the earth were formed; and\r\nin two more the seven heavens.[35] There is no more detail of\r\ncircumstances; and the deluge, which is also mentioned, is discussed\r\nwith equal brevity. The waters are represented to have poured out of an\r\noven; a strange fable, said to be borrowed from the Persian Magi, who\r\nrepresented them as issuing from the oven of an old woman.[36] All men\r\nwere drowned, save Noah and his family; and then God said, \"O earth,\r\nswallow up thy waters; and thou, O heaven, withhold thy rain;\" and\r\nimmediately the waters abated.[37]\r\n\r\nWe may suppose Omar to have represented the desertion of the land by the\r\nsea to have been gradual, and that his hypothesis required a greater\r\nlapse of ages than was consistent with Moslem orthodoxy; for it is to be\r\ninferred from the Koran, that man and this planet were created at the\r\nsame time; and although Mahomet did not limit expressly the antiquity of\r\nthe human race, yet he gave an implied sanction to the Mosaic\r\nchronology, by the veneration expressed by him for the Hebrew\r\nPatriarchs.[38]\r\n\r\nA manuscript work, entitled the \"Wonders of Nature,\" is preserved in\r\nthe Royal Library at Paris, by an Arabian writer, Mohammed Kazwini, who\r\nflourished in the seventh century of the Hegira, or at the close of the\r\nthirteenth century of our era.[39] Besides several curious remarks on\r\naerolites, earthquakes, and the successive changes of position which the\r\nland and sea have undergone, we meet with the following beautiful\r\npassage which is given as the narrative of Kidhz, an allegorical\r\npersonage:--\"I passed one day by a very ancient and wonderfully populous\r\ncity, and asked one of its inhabitants how long it had been founded. 'It\r\nis indeed a mighty city,' replied he; 'we know not how long it has\r\nexisted, and our ancestors were on this subject as ignorant as\r\nourselves.' Five centuries afterwards, as I passed by the same place, I\r\ncould not perceive the slightest vestige of the city. I demanded of a\r\npeasant, who was gathering herbs upon its former site, how long it had\r\nbeen destroyed. 'In sooth a strange question!' replied he. 'The ground\r\nhere has never been different from what you now behold it.'--'Was there\r\nnot of old,' said I, 'a splendid city here?'--'Never,' answered he, 'so\r\nfar as we have seen, and never did our fathers speak to us of any such.'\r\nOn my return there 500 years afterwards, _I found the sea in the same\r\nplace_, and on its shores were a party of fishermen, of whom I inquired\r\nhow long the land had been covered by the waters? 'Is this a question,'\r\nsaid they, 'for a man like you? this spot has always been what it is\r\nnow.' I again returned, 500 years afterwards, and the sea had\r\ndisappeared; I inquired of a man who stood alone upon the spot, how long\r\nago this change had taken place, and he gave me the same answer as I had\r\nreceived before. Lastly, on coming back again after an equal lapse of\r\ntime, I found there a flourishing city, more populous and more rich in\r\nbeautiful buildings, than the city I had seen the first time, and when I\r\nwould fain have informed myself concerning its origin, the inhabitants\r\nanswered me, 'Its rise is lost in remote antiquity: we are ignorant how\r\nlong it has existed, and our fathers were on this subject as ignorant as\r\nourselves.'\"\r\n\r\n_Early Italian writers._--It was not till the earlier part of the\r\nsixteenth century that geological phenomena began to attract the\r\nattention of the Christian nations. At that period a very animated\r\ncontroversy sprang up in Italy, concerning the true nature and origin of\r\nmarine shells, and other organized fossils, found abundantly in the\r\nstrata of the peninsula. The celebrated painter Leonardo da Vinci, who\r\nin his youth had planned and executed some navigable canals in the north\r\nof Italy, was one of the first who applied sound reasoning to these\r\nsubjects. The mud of rivers, he said, had covered and penetrated into\r\nthe interior of fossil shells at a time when these were still at the\r\nbottom of the sea near the coast. \"They tell us that these shells were\r\nformed in the hills by the influence of the stars; but I ask where in\r\nthe hills are the stars now forming shells of distinct ages and species?\r\nand how can the stars explain the origin of gravel, occurring at\r\ndifferent heights and composed of pebbles rounded as if by the motion of\r\nrunning water; or in what manner can such a cause account for the\r\npetrifaction in the same places of various leaves, sea-weeds, and\r\nmarine-crabs?\"[40]\r\n\r\nThe excavations made in 1517, for repairing the city of Verona, brought\r\nto light a multitude of curious petrifactions, and furnished matter for\r\nspeculation to different authors, and among the rest to Fracastoro,[41]\r\nwho declared his opinion, that fossil shells had all belonged to living\r\nanimals, which had formerly lived and multiplied where there exuviae are\r\nnow found. He exposed the absurdity of having recourse to a certain\r\n\"plastic force,\" which it was said had power to fashion stones into\r\norganic forms; and with no less cogent arguments, demonstrated the\r\nfutility of attributing the situation of the shells in question to the\r\nMosaic deluge, a theory obstinately defended by some. That inundation,\r\nhe observed, was too transient; it consisted principally of fluviatile\r\nwaters; and if it had transported shells to great distances, must have\r\nstrewed them over the surface, not buried them at vast depths in the\r\ninterior of mountains. His clear exposition of the evidence would have\r\nterminated the discussion forever, if the passions of mankind had not\r\nbeen enlisted in the dispute; and even though doubts should for a time\r\nhave remained in some minds, they would speedily have been removed by\r\nthe fresh information obtained almost immediately afterwards, respecting\r\nthe structure of fossil remains, and of their living analogues.\r\n\r\nBut the clear and philosophical views of Fracastoro were disregarded,\r\nand the talent and argumentative powers of the learned were doomed for\r\nthree centuries to be wasted in the discussion of these two simple and\r\npreliminary questions: first, whether fossil remains had ever belonged\r\nto living creatures; and, secondly, whether, if this be admitted, all\r\nthe phenomena could not be explained by the deluge of Noah. It had been\r\nthe general belief of the Christian world down to the period now under\r\nconsideration, that the origin of this planet was not more remote than a\r\nfew thousand years; and that since the creation the deluge was the only\r\ngreat catastrophe by which considerable change had been wrought on the\r\nearth's surface. On the other hand, the opinion was scarcely less\r\ngeneral, that the final dissolution of our system was an event to be\r\nlooked for at no distant period. The era, it is true, of the expected\r\nmillennium had passed away; and for five hundred years after the fatal\r\nhour when the annihilation of the planet had been looked for, the monks\r\nremained in undisturbed enjoyment of rich grants of land bequeathed to\r\nthem by pious donors, who, in the preamble of deeds beginning\r\n\"appropinquante mundi termino\"----\"appropinquante magno judicii die,\"\r\nleft lasting monuments of the popular delusion.[42]\r\n\r\nBut although in the sixteenth century it had become necessary to\r\ninterpret certain prophecies respecting the millennium more liberally,\r\nand to assign a more distant date to the future conflagration of the\r\nworld, we find, in the speculations of the early geologists, perpetual\r\nallusion to such an approaching catastrophe; while in all that regarded\r\nthe antiquity of the earth, no modification whatever of the opinions of\r\nthe dark ages had been effected. Considerable alarm was at first excited\r\nwhen the attempt was made to invalidate, by physical proofs, an article\r\nof faith so generally received; but there was sufficient spirit of\r\ntoleration and candor amongst the Italian ecclesiastics, to allow the\r\nsubject to be canvassed with much freedom. They even entered warmly into\r\nthe controversy themselves, often favoring different sides of the\r\nquestion; and however much we may deplore the loss of time and labor\r\ndevoted to the defence of untenable positions, it must be conceded that\r\nthey displayed far less polemic bitterness than certain writers who\r\nfollowed them \"beyond the Alps,\" two centuries and a half later.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTROVERSY AS TO THE REAL NATURE OF FOSSIL ORGANIC REMAINS.\r\n\r\n_Mattioli--Falloppio._--The system of scholastic disputations,\r\nencouraged in the universities of the middle ages, had unfortunately\r\ntrained men to habits of indefinite argumentation; and they often\r\npreferred absurd and extravagant propositions, because greater skill was\r\nrequired to maintain them; the end and object of these intellectual\r\ncombats being victory, and not truth. No theory could be so far-fetched\r\nor fantastical as not to attract some followers, provided it fell in\r\nwith popular notions; and as cosmogonists were not at all restricted, in\r\nbuilding their systems, to the agency of known causes, the opponents of\r\nFracastoro met his arguments by feigning imaginary causes, which\r\ndiffered from each other rather in name than in substance. Andrea\r\nMattioli, for instance, an eminent botanist, the illustrator of\r\nDioscorides, embraced the notion of Agricola, a skilful German miner,\r\nthat a certain \"materia pinguis,\" or \"fatty matter,\" set into\r\nfermentation by heat, gave birth to fossil organic shapes. Yet Mattioli\r\nhad come to the conclusion, from his own observations, that porous\r\nbodies, such as bones and shells, might be converted into stone, as\r\nbeing permeable to what he termed the \"lapidifying juice.\" In like\r\nmanner, Falloppio of Padua conceived that petrified shells were\r\ngenerated by fermentation in the spots where they are found, or that\r\nthey had in some cases acquired their form from \"the tumultuous\r\nmovements of terrestrial exhalations.\" Although celebrated as a\r\nprofessor of anatomy, he taught that certain tusks of elephants, dug up\r\nin his time in Apulia, were mere earthy concretions; and, consistently\r\nwith these principles, he even went so far as to consider it probable,\r\nthat the vases of Monte Testaceo at Rome were natural impressions\r\nstamped in the soil.[43] In the same spirit, Mercati, who published, in\r\n1574, faithful figures of the fossil shells preserved by Pope Sixtus V.\r\nin the Museum of the Vatican, expressed an opinion that they were mere\r\nstones, which had assumed their peculiar configuration from the\r\ninfluence of the heavenly bodies; and Olivi of Cremona, who described\r\nthe fossil remains of a rich museum at Verona, was satisfied with\r\nconsidering them as mere \"sports of nature.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the fanciful notions of those times were deemed less\r\nunreasonable, as being somewhat in harmony with the Aristotelian theory\r\nof spontaneous generation, then taught in all the schools.[44] For men\r\nwho had been taught in early youth, that a large proportion of living\r\nanimals and plants was formed from the fortuitous concourse of atoms, or\r\nhad sprung from the corruption of organic matter, might easily persuade\r\nthemselves that organic shapes, often imperfectly preserved in the\r\ninterior of solid rocks, owed their existence to causes equally obscure\r\nand mysterious.\r\n\r\n_Cardano_, 1552.--But there were not wanting some who, during the\r\nprogress of this century, expressed more sound and sober opinions. The\r\ntitle of a work of Cardano's, published in 1552, \"De Subtilitate\"\r\n(corresponding to what would now be called Transcendental Philosophy),\r\nwould lead us to expect, in the chapter on minerals, many far-fetched\r\ntheories characteristic of that age; but when treating of petrified\r\nshells, he decided that they clearly indicated the former sojourn of the\r\nsea upon the mountains.[45]\r\n\r\n_Cesalpino--Majoli_, 1597.--Cesalpino, a celebrated botanist, conceived\r\nthat fossil shells had been left on the land by the retiring sea, and\r\nhad concreted into stone during the consolidation of the soil;[46] and\r\nin the following year (1597), Simeone Majoli[47] went still farther;\r\nand, coinciding for the most part with the views of Cesalpino, suggested\r\nthat the shells and submarine matter of the Veronese, and other\r\ndistricts, might have been cast up upon the land by volcanic explosions,\r\nlike those which gave rise, in 1538, to Monte Nuovo, near Puzzuoli. This\r\nhint seems to have been the first imperfect attempt to connect the\r\nposition of fossil shells with the agency of volcanoes, a system\r\nafterwards more fully developed by Hooke, Lazzaro Moro, Hutton, and\r\nother writers.\r\n\r\nTwo years afterwards, Imperati advocated the animal origin of fossilized\r\nshells, yet admitted that stones could vegetate by force of \"an internal\r\nprinciple;\" and, as evidence of this, he referred to the teeth of fish\r\nand spines of echini found petrified.[48]\r\n\r\n_Palissy_, 1580.--Palissy, a French writer on \"The Origin of Springs\r\nfrom Rain-water,\" and of other scientific works, undertook, in 1580, to\r\ncombat the notions of many of his contemporaries in Italy, that\r\npetrified shells had all been deposited by the universal deluge. \"He was\r\nthe first,\" said Fontenelle, when, in the French Academy, he pronounced\r\nhis eulogy, nearly a century and a half later, \"who dared assert,\" in\r\nParis, that fossil remains of testacea and fish had once belonged to\r\nmarine animals.\r\n\r\n_Fabio Colonna._--To enumerate the multitude of Italian writers, who\r\nadvanced various hypotheses, all equally fantastical, in the early part\r\nof the seventeenth century, would be unprofitably tedious; but Fabio\r\nColonna deserves to be distinguished; for, although he gave way to the\r\ndogma, that all fossil remains were to be referred to the deluge of\r\nNoah, he resisted the absurd theory of Stelluti, who taught that fossil\r\nwood and ammonites were mere clay, altered into such forms by\r\nsulphureous waters and subterranean heat; and he pointed out the\r\ndifferent states of shells buried in the strata, distinguishing between,\r\nfirst, the mere mould or impression; second, the cast or nucleus; and,\r\nthirdly, the remains of the shell itself. He had also the merit of being\r\nthe first to point out that some of the fossils had belonged to marine\r\nand some to terrestrial testacea.[49]\r\n\r\n_Steno_, 1669.--But the most remarkable work of that period was\r\npublished by Steno, a Dane, once professor of anatomy at Padua, and who\r\nafterwards resided many years at the court of the Grand Duke of Tuscany.\r\nHis treatise bears the quaint title of \"De Solido intra Solidum\r\nnaturaltier contento (1669),\" by which the author intended to express,\r\n\"On Gems, Crystals, and organic Petrifactions inclosed within solid\r\nRocks.\" This work attests the priority of the Italian school in\r\ngeological research; exemplifying at the same time the powerful\r\nobstacles opposed, in that age, to the general reception of enlarged\r\nviews in the science. It was still a favorite dogma, that the fossil\r\nremains of shells and marine creatures were not of animal origin; an\r\nopinion adhered to by many from their extreme reluctance to believe,\r\nthat the earth could have been inhabited by living beings before a great\r\npart of the existing mountains were formed. In reference to this\r\ncontroversy, Steno had dissected a shark recently taken from the\r\nMediterranean, and had demonstrated that its teeth and bones were\r\nidentical with many fossils found in Tuscany. He had also compared the\r\nshells discovered in the Italian strata with living species, pointed out\r\ntheir resemblance, and traced the various gradations from shells merely\r\ncalcined, or which had only lost their animal gluten, to those\r\npetrifactions in which there was a perfect substitution of stony matter.\r\nIn his division of mineral masses, he insisted on the secondary origin\r\nof those deposits in which the spoils of animals or fragments of older\r\nrocks were inclosed. He distinguished between marine formations and\r\nthose of a fluviatile character, the last containing reeds, grasses,\r\nor the trunks and branches of trees. He argued in favor of the original\r\nhorizontality of sedimentary deposits, attributing their present\r\ninclined and vertical position sometimes to the escape of subterranean\r\nvapors heaving the crust of the earth from below upwards, and sometimes\r\nto the falling in of masses overlying subterranean cavities.\r\n\r\nHe declared that he had obtained proof that Tuscany must successively\r\nhave acquired six distinct configurations, having been twice covered by\r\nwater, twice laid dry with a level, and twice with an irregular and\r\nuneven surface.[50] He displayed great anxiety to reconcile his new\r\nviews with Scripture, for which purpose he pointed to certain rocks as\r\nhaving been formed before the existence of animals and plants: selecting\r\nunfortunately as examples certain formations of limestone and sandstone\r\nin his own country, now known to contain, though sparingly, the remains\r\nof animals and plants,--strata which do not even rank as the oldest part\r\nof our secondary series. Steno suggested that Moses, when speaking of\r\nthe loftiest mountains as having been covered by the deluge, meant\r\nmerely the loftiest of the hills then existing, which may not have been\r\nvery high. The diluvian waters, he supposed, may have issued from the\r\ninterior of the earth into which they had retired, when in the beginning\r\nthe land was separated from the sea. These, and other hypotheses on the\r\nsame subject, are not calculated to enhance the value of the treatise,\r\nand could scarcely fail to detract from the authority of those opinions\r\nwhich were sound and legitimate deductions from fact and observation.\r\nThey have served, nevertheless, as the germs of many popular theories of\r\nlater times, and in an expanded form have been put forth as original\r\ninventions by some of our contemporaries.\r\n\r\n_Scilla_, 1670.--Scilla, a Sicilian painter, published, in 1670, a\r\ntreatise, in Latin, on the fossils of Calabria, illustrated by good\r\nengravings. This work proves the continued ascendancy of dogmas often\r\nrefuted; for we find the wit and eloquence of the author chiefly\r\ndirected against the obstinate incredulity of naturalists as to the\r\norganic nature of fossil shells.[51] Like many eminent naturalists of\r\nhis day, Scilla gave way to the popular persuasion, that all fossil\r\nshells were the effects and proofs of the Mosaic deluge. It may be\r\ndoubted whether he was perfectly sincere, and some of his contemporaries\r\nwho took the same course were certainly not so. But so eager were they\r\nto root out what they justly considered an absurd prejudice respecting\r\nthe nature of organized fossils, that they seem to have been ready to\r\nmake any concessions, in order to establish this preliminary point. Such\r\na compromising policy was short-sighted, since it was to little purpose\r\nthat the nature of the documents should at length be correctly\r\nunderstood, if men were to be prevented from deducing fair conclusions\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\n_Diluvial Theory._--The theologians who now entered the field in Italy,\r\nGermany, France, and England, were innumerable; and henceforward, they\r\nwho refused to subscribe to the position, that all marine organic\r\nremains were proofs of the Mosaic deluge, were exposed to the imputation\r\nof disbelieving the whole of the sacred writings. Scarcely any step had\r\nbeen made in approximating to sound theories since the time of\r\nFracastoro, more than a hundred years having been lost, in writing down\r\nthe dogma that organized fossils were mere sports of nature. An\r\nadditional period of a century and a half was now destined to be\r\nconsumed in exploding the hypothesis, that organized fossils had all\r\nbeen buried in the solid strata by Noah's flood. Never did a theoretical\r\nfallacy, in any branch of science, interfere more seriously with\r\naccurate observation and the systematic classification of facts. In\r\nrecent times, we may attribute our rapid progress chiefly to the careful\r\ndetermination of the order of succession in mineral masses, by means of\r\ntheir different organic contents, and their regular superposition. But\r\nthe old diluvialists were induced by their system to confound all the\r\ngroups of strata together instead of discriminating,--to refer all\r\nappearances to one cause and to one brief period, not to a variety of\r\ncauses acting throughout a long succession of epochs. They saw the\r\nphenomena only as they desired to see them, sometimes misrepresenting\r\nfacts, and at other times deducing false conclusions from correct data.\r\nUnder the influence of such prejudices, three centuries were of as\r\nlittle avail as a few years in our own times, when we are no longer\r\nrequired to propel the vessel against the force of an adverse current.\r\n\r\nIt may be well, therefore, to forewarn the reader, that in tracing the\r\nhistory of geology from the close of the seventeenth to the end of the\r\neighteenth century, he must expect to be occupied with accounts of the\r\nretardation, as well as of the advance, of the science. It will be\r\nnecessary to point out the frequent revival of exploded errors, and the\r\nrelapse from sound to the most absurd opinions; and to dwell on futile\r\nreasoning and visionary hypothesis, because some of the most extravagant\r\nsystems were invented or controverted by men of acknowledged talent. In\r\nshort, a sketch of the progress of geology is the history of a constant\r\nand violent struggle of new opinions against doctrines sanctioned by the\r\nimplicit faith of many generations, and supposed to rest on scriptural\r\nauthority. The inquiry, therefore, although highly interesting to one\r\nwho studies the philosophy of the human mind, is too often barren of\r\ninstruction to him who searches for truths in physical science.\r\n\r\n_Quirini_, 1676.--Quirini, in 1676,[52] contended, in opposition to\r\nScilla, that the diluvian waters could not have conveyed heavy bodies to\r\nthe summit of mountains, since the agitation of the sea never (as Boyle\r\nhad demonstrated) extended to great depths;[53] and still less could\r\nthe testacea, as some pretended, have lived in these diluvian waters;\r\nfor \"the duration of the flood was brief, and _the heavy rains must have\r\ndestroyed the saltness of the sea!_\" He was the first writer who\r\nventured to maintain that the universality of the Mosaic cataclysm ought\r\nnot to be insisted upon. As to the nature of petrified shells, he\r\nconceived that as earthy particles united in the sea to form the shells\r\nof mollusca, the same crystallizing process might be effected on the\r\nland; and that, in the latter case, the germs of the animals might have\r\nbeen disseminated through the substance of the rocks, and afterwards\r\ndeveloped by virtue of humidity. Visionary as was this doctrine, it\r\ngained many proselytes even amongst the more sober reasoners of Italy\r\nand Germany; for it conceded that the position of fossil bodies could\r\nnot be accounted for by the diluvial theory.\r\n\r\n_Plot--Lister_, 1678.--In the mean time, the doctrine that fossil shells\r\nhad never belonged to real animals maintained its ground in England,\r\nwhere the agitation of the question began at a much later period. Dr.\r\nPlot, in his \"Natural History of Oxfordshire\" (1677), attributed to a\r\n\"plastic virtue latent in the earth\" the origin of fossil shells and\r\nfishes; and Lister, to his accurate account of British shells, in 1678,\r\nadded the fossil species, under the appellation of _turbinated and\r\nbivalve stones_. \"Either,\" said he, \"these were terriginous, or, if\r\notherwise, the animals they so exactly represent _have become extinct_.\"\r\nThis writer appears to have been the first who was aware of the\r\ncontinuity over large districts of the principal groups of strata in the\r\nBritish series, and who proposed the construction of regular geological\r\nmaps.[54]\r\n\r\n_Leibnitz_, 1680.--The great mathematician Leibnitz published his\r\n\"Protogoea\" in 1680. He imagined this planet to have been originally a\r\nburning luminous mass, which ever since its creation has been undergoing\r\nrefrigeration. When the outer crust had cooled down sufficiently to\r\nallow the vapors to be condensed, they fell, and formed a universal\r\nocean, covering the loftiest mountains, and investing the whole globe.\r\nThe crust, as it consolidated from a state of fusion, assumed a\r\nvesicular and cavernous structure; and being rent in some places,\r\nallowed the water to rush into the subterranean hollows, whereby the\r\nlevel of the primeval ocean was lowered. The breaking in of these vast\r\ncaverns is supposed to have given rise to the dislocated and deranged\r\nposition of the strata \"which Steno had described,\" and the same\r\ndisruptions communicated violent movements to the incumbent waters,\r\nwhence great inundations ensued. The waters, after they had been thus\r\nagitated, deposited their sedimentary matter during intervals of\r\nquiescence, and hence the various stony and earthy strata. \"We may\r\nrecognize, therefore,\" says Leibnitz, \"a double origin of primitive\r\nmasses, the one by refrigeration from igneous fusion, the other by\r\nconcretion from aqueous solution.\"[55] By the repetition of similar\r\ncauses (the disruption of the crust and consequent floods), alternations\r\nof new strata were produced, until at length these causes were reduced\r\nto a condition of quiescent equilibrium, and a more permanent state of\r\nthings was established.[56]\r\n\r\n_Hooke_, 1688.--The \"Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke, M. D.,\" well\r\nknown as a great mathematician and natural philosopher, appeared in\r\n1705, containing \"A Discourse of Earthquakes,\" which, we are informed by\r\nhis editor, was written in 1668, but revised at subsequent periods.[57]\r\nHooke frequently refers to the best Italian and English authors who\r\nwrote before his time on geological subjects; but there are no passages\r\nin his works implying that he participated in the enlarged views of\r\nSteno and Lister, or of his contemporary, Woodward, in regard to the\r\ngeographical extent of certain groups of strata. His treatise, however,\r\nis the most philosophical production of that age, in regard to the\r\ncauses of former changes in the organic and inorganic kingdoms of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\"However trivial a thing,\" he says, \"a rotten shell may appear to some,\r\nyet these monuments of nature are more certain tokens of antiquity than\r\ncoins or medals, since the best of those may be counterfeited or made by\r\nart and design, as may also books, manuscripts, and inscriptions, as all\r\nthe learned are now sufficiently satisfied has often been actually\r\npractised,\" &c.; \"and though it must be granted that it is very\r\ndifficult to read them (the records of nature) and _to raise a\r\nchronology out of them_, and to state the intervals of the time wherein\r\nsuch or such catastrophes and mutations have happened, yet it is not\r\nimpossible.\"[58]\r\n\r\nRespecting the extinction of species, Hooke was aware that the fossil\r\nammonites, nautili, and many other shells and fossil skeletons found in\r\nEngland, were of different species from any then known; but he doubted\r\nwhether the species had become extinct, observing that the knowledge of\r\nnaturalists of all the marine species, especially those inhabiting the\r\ndeep sea, was very deficient. In some parts of his writings, however,\r\nhe leans to the opinion that species had been lost; and in speculating\r\non this subject, he even suggests that there might be some connection\r\nbetween the disappearance of certain kinds of animals and plants, and\r\nthe changes wrought by earthquakes in former ages. Some species, he\r\nobserves, with great sagacity, are \"_peculiar to certain places_, and\r\nnot to be found elsewhere. If, then, such a place had been swallowed up,\r\nit is not improbable but that those animate beings may have been\r\ndestroyed with it; and this may be true both of aerial and aquatic\r\nanimals; for those animated bodies, whether vegetables or animals, which\r\nwere naturally nourished or refreshed by the air, would be destroyed by\r\nthe water,\" &c.[59] Turtles, he adds, and such large ammonites as are\r\nfound in Portland, seem to have been the productions of hotter\r\ncountries; and it is necessary to suppose that England once lay under\r\nthe sea within the torrid zone! To explain this and similar phenomena,\r\nhe indulges in a variety of speculations concerning changes in the\r\nposition of the axis of the earth's rotation, \"a shifting of the earth's\r\ncentre of gravity, analogous to the revolutions of the magnetic pole,\"\r\n&c. None of these conjectures, however, are proposed dogmatically, but\r\nrather in the hope of promoting fresh inquiries and experiments.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the prejudices of his age, we find him arguing against\r\nthe idea that nature had formed fossil bodies \"for no other end than to\r\nplay the mimic in the mineral kingdom;\"--maintaining that figured stones\r\nwere \"really the several bodies they represent, or the mouldings of them\r\npetrified,\" and not, as some have imagined, 'a lusus naturae,' sporting\r\nherself in the needless formation of useless beings.\"[60]\r\n\r\nIt was objected to Hooke, that his doctrine of the extinction of species\r\nderogated from the wisdom and power of the omnipotent Creator; but he\r\nanswered, that, as individuals die, there may be some termination to the\r\nduration of a species; and his opinions, he declared, were not repugnant\r\nto Holy Writ: for the Scriptures taught that our system was\r\ndegenerating, and tending to its final dissolution; \"and as, when that\r\nshall happen, all the species will be lost, why not some at one time and\r\nsome at another?\"[61]\r\n\r\nBut his principal object was to account for the manner in which shells\r\nhad been conveyed into the higher parts of \"the Alps, Apennines, and\r\nPyrenean hills, and the interior of continents in general.\" These and\r\nother appearances, he said, might have been brought about by\r\nearthquakes, \"which have turned plains into mountains, and mountains\r\ninto plains, seas into land, and land into seas, made rivers where there\r\nwere none before, and swallowed up others that formerly were, &c., &c.;\r\nand which, since the creation of the world, have wrought many great\r\nchanges on the superficial parts of the earth, and have been the\r\ninstruments of placing shells, bones, plants, fishes, and the like, in\r\nthose places where, with much astonishment, we find them.\"[62] This\r\ndoctrine, it is true, had been laid down in terms almost equally\r\nexplicit by Strabo, to explain the occurrence of fossil shells in the\r\ninterior of continents, and to that geographer, and other writers of\r\nantiquity, Hooke frequently refers; but the revival and development of\r\nthe system was an important step in the progress of modern science.\r\n\r\nHooke enumerated all the examples known to him of subterranean\r\ndisturbance, from \"the sad catastrophe of Sodom and Gomorrah,\" down to\r\nthe Chilian earthquake of 1646. The elevating of the bottom of the sea,\r\nthe sinking and submersion of the land, and most of the inequalities of\r\nthe earth's surface, might, he said, be accounted for by the agency of\r\nthese subterranean causes. He mentions that the coast near Naples _was\r\nraised during the eruption of Monte Nuovo_; and that, in 1591, land rose\r\nin the island of St. Michael, during an eruption: and although it would\r\nbe more difficult, he says, to prove, he does not doubt but that there\r\nhad been as many earthquakes in the parts of the earth under the ocean,\r\nas in the parts of the dry land; in confirmation of which, he mentions\r\nthe immeasurable depth of the sea near some volcanoes. To attest the\r\nextent of simultaneous subterranean movements, he refers to an\r\nearthquake in the West Indies, in the year 1690, where the space of\r\nearth raised, or \"struck upwards,\" by the shock, exceeded, he affirms,\r\nthe length of the Alps and Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n_Hooke's diluvial Theory._--As Hooke declared the favorite hypothesis of\r\nthe day, \"that marine fossil bodies were to be referred to Noah's\r\nflood,\" to be wholly untenable, he appears to have felt himself called\r\nupon to substitute a diluvial theory of his own, and thus he became\r\ninvolved in countless difficulties and contradictions. \"During the great\r\ncatastrophe,\" he said, \"there might have been a changing of that part\r\nwhich was before dry land into sea by sinking, and of that which was sea\r\ninto dry land by raising, and marine bodies might have been buried in\r\nsediment beneath the ocean, in the interval between the creation and the\r\ndeluge.\"[63] Then follows a disquisition on the separation of the land\r\nfrom the waters, mentioned in Genesis; during which operation some\r\nplaces of the shell of the earth were forced outwards, and others\r\npressed downwards or inwards, &c. His diluvial hypothesis very much\r\nresembled that of Steno, and was entirely opposed to the fundamental\r\nprinciples professed by him, that he would explain the former changes\r\nof the earth _in a more natural manner_ than others had done. When, in\r\ndespite of this declaration, he required a former \"crisis of nature,\"\r\nand taught that earthquakes had become debilitated, and that the Alps,\r\nAndes, and other chains, had been lifted up in a few months, he was\r\ncompelled to assume so rapid a rate of change, that his machinery\r\nappeared scarcely less extravagant than that of his most fanciful\r\npredecessors. For this reason, perhaps, his whole theory of earthquakes\r\nmet with undeserved neglect.\r\n\r\n_Ray_, 1692.--One of his contemporaries, the celebrated naturalist, Ray,\r\nparticipated in the same desire to explain geological phenomena by\r\nreference to causes less hypothetical than those usually resorted\r\nto.[64] In his essay on \"Chaos and Creation,\" he proposed a system,\r\nagreeing in its outline, and in many of its details, with that of Hooke;\r\nbut his knowledge of natural history enabled him to elucidate the\r\nsubject with various original observations. Earthquakes, he suggested,\r\nmight have been the second causes employed at the creation, in\r\nseparating the land from the waters, and in gathering the waters\r\ntogether into one place. He mentions, like Hooke, the earthquake of\r\n1646, which had violently shaken the Andes for some hundreds of leagues,\r\nand made many alterations therein. In assigning a cause for the general\r\ndeluge, he preferred a change in the earth's centre of gravity to the\r\nintroduction of earthquakes. Some unknown cause, he said, might have\r\nforced the subterranean waters outwards, as was, perhaps, indicated by\r\n\"the breaking up of the fountains of the great deep.\"\r\n\r\nRay was one of the first of our writers who enlarged upon the effects of\r\nrunning water upon the land, and of the encroachment of the sea upon the\r\nshores. So important did he consider the agency of these causes, that he\r\nsaw in them an indication of the tendency of our system to its final\r\ndissolution; and he wondered why the earth did not proceed more rapidly\r\ntowards a general submersion beneath the sea, when so much matter was\r\ncarried down by rivers, or undermined in the sea-cliffs. We perceive\r\nclearly from his writings, that the gradual decline of our system, and\r\nits future consummation by fire, was held to be as necessary an article\r\nof faith by the orthodox, as was the recent origin of our planet. His\r\ndiscourses, like those of Hooke, are highly interesting, as attesting\r\nthe familiar association in the minds of philosophers, in the age of\r\nNewton, of questions in physics and divinity. Ray gave an unequivocal\r\nproof of the sincerity of his mind, by sacrificing his preferment in the\r\nchurch, rather than take an oath against the Covenanters, which he could\r\nnot reconcile with his conscience. His reputation, moreover, in the\r\nscientific world placed him high above the temptation of courting\r\npopularity, by pandering to the physico-theological taste of his age. It\r\nis, therefore, curious to meet with so many citations from the\r\nChristian fathers and prophets in his essays on physical science--to\r\nfind him in one page proceeding, by the strict rules of induction, to\r\nexplain the former changes of the globe, and in the next gravely\r\nentertaining the question, whether the sun and stars, and the whole\r\nheavens, shall be annihilated, together with the earth, at the era of\r\nthe grand conflagration.\r\n\r\n_Woodward, 1695._--Among the contemporaries of Hooke and Ray, Woodward,\r\na professor of medicine, had acquired the most extensive information\r\nrespecting the geological structure of the crust of the earth. He had\r\nexamined many parts of the British strata with minute attention; and his\r\nsystematic collection of specimens, bequeathed to the University of\r\nCambridge, and still preserved there as arranged by him, shows how far\r\nhe had advanced in ascertaining the order of superposition. From the\r\ngreat number of facts collected by him, we might have expected his\r\ntheoretical views to be more sound and enlarged than those of his\r\ncontemporaries; but in his anxiety to accommodate all observed phenomena\r\nto the scriptural account of the Creation and Deluge, he arrived at most\r\nerroneous results. He conceived \"the whole terrestrial globe to have\r\nbeen taken to pieces and dissolved at the flood, and the strata to have\r\nsettled down from this promiscuous mass as any earthy sediment from a\r\nfluid.\"[65] In corroboration of these views he insisted upon the fact,\r\nthat \"marine bodies are lodged in the strata according to the order of\r\ntheir gravity, the heavier shells in stone, the lighter in chalk, and so\r\nof the rest.\"[66] Ray immediately exposed the unfounded nature of this\r\nassertion, remarking truly that fossil bodies \"are often mingled, heavy\r\nwith light, in the same stratum;\" and he even went so far as to say,\r\nthat Woodward \"must have invented the phenomena for the sake of\r\nconfirming his bold and strange hypothesis\"[67]--a strong expression\r\nfrom the pen of a contemporary.\r\n\r\n_Burnet, 1690._--At the same time Burnet published his \"Theory of the\r\nEarth.\"[68] The title is most characteristic of the age,--\"The Sacred\r\nTheory of the Earth; containing an Account of the Original of the Earth,\r\nand of all the general Changes which it hath already undergone, or is to\r\nundergo, till the Consummation of all Things.\" Even Milton had scarcely\r\nventured in his poem to indulge his imagination so freely in painting\r\nscenes of the Creation and Deluge, Paradise and Chaos. He explained why\r\nthe primeval earth enjoyed a perpetual spring before the flood! showed\r\nhow the crust of the globe was fissured by \"the sun's rays,\" so that it\r\nburst, and thus the diluvial waters were let loose from a supposed\r\ncentral abyss. Not satisfied with these themes, he derived from the\r\nbooks of the inspired writers, and even from heathen authorities,\r\nprophetic views of the future revolutions of the globe, gave a most\r\nterrific description of the general conflagration, and proved that a new\r\nheaven and a new earth will rise out of a _second chaos_--after which\r\nwill follow the blessed millennium.\r\n\r\nThe reader should be informed, that, according to the opinion of many\r\nrespectable writers of that age, there was good scriptural ground for\r\npresuming that the garden bestowed upon our first parents was not on the\r\nearth itself, but above the clouds, in the middle region between our\r\nplanet and the moon. Burnet approaches with becoming gravity the\r\ndiscussion of so important a topic. He was willing to concede that the\r\ngeographical position of Paradise was not in Mesopotamia, yet he\r\nmaintained that it was upon the earth, and in the southern hemisphere,\r\nnear the equinoctial line. Butler selected this conceit as a fair mark\r\nfor his satire, when, amongst the numerous accomplishments of Hudibras,\r\nhe says,--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"He knew the seat of Paradise,\r\n   Could tell in what degree it lies;\r\n   And, as he was disposed, could prove it\r\n   Below the moon, or else above it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYet the same monarch, who is said never to have slept without Butler's\r\npoem under his pillow, was so great an admirer and patron of Burnet's\r\nbook, that he ordered it to be translated from the Latin into English.\r\nThe style of the \"Sacred Theory\" was eloquent, and the book displayed\r\npowers of invention of no ordinary stamp. It was, in fact, a fine\r\nhistorical romance, as Buffon afterwards declared; but it was treated as\r\na work of profound science in the time of its author, and was\r\npanegyrized by Addison in a Latin ode, while Steele praised it in the\r\n\"Spectator.\"\r\n\r\n_Whiston, 1696._--Another production of the same school, and equally\r\ncharacteristic of the time, was that of Whiston, entitled, \"A New Theory\r\nof the Earth; wherein the Creation of the world in Six Days, the\r\nUniversal Deluge, and the General Conflagration, as laid down in the\r\nHoly Scriptures, are shown to be perfectly agreeable to Reason and\r\nPhilosophy.\" He was at first a follower of Burnet; but his faith in the\r\ninfallibility of that writer was shaken by the declared opinion of\r\nNewton, that there was every presumption in astronomy against any former\r\nchange in the inclination of the earth's axis. This was a leading dogma\r\nin Burnet's system, though not original, for it was borrowed from an\r\nItalian, Alessandro degli Alessandri, who had suggested it in the\r\nbeginning of the fifteenth century, to account for the former occupation\r\nof the present continents by the sea. La Place has since strengthened\r\nthe arguments of Newton, against the probability of any former\r\nrevolution of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable comet of 1680 was fresh in the memory of every one when\r\nWhiston first began his cosmological studies; and the principal novelty\r\nof his speculations consisted in attributing the deluge to the near\r\napproach to the earth of one of these erratic bodies. Having ascribed an\r\nincrease of the waters to this source, he adopted Woodward's theory,\r\nsupposing all stratified deposits to have resulted from the \"chaotic\r\nsediment of the flood.\" Whiston was one of the first who ventured to\r\npropose that the text of Genesis should be interpreted differently from\r\nits ordinary acceptation, so that the doctrine of the earth having\r\nexisted long previous to the creation of man might no longer be regarded\r\nas unorthodox. He had the art to throw an air of plausibility over the\r\nmost improbable parts of his theory, and seemed to be proceeding in the\r\nmost sober manner, and, by the aid of mathematical demonstration, to the\r\nestablishment of his various propositions. Locke pronounced a panegyric\r\non his theory, commending him for having explained so many wonderful and\r\nbefore inexplicable things. His book, as well as Burnet's, was attacked\r\nand refuted by Keill.[69] Like all who introduced purely hypothetical\r\ncauses to account for natural phenomena, Whiston retarded the progress\r\nof truth, diverting men from the investigation of the laws of sublunary\r\nnature, and inducing them to waste time in speculations on the power of\r\ncomets to drag the waters of the ocean over the land--on the\r\ncondensation of the vapors of their tails into water, and other matters\r\nequally edifying.\r\n\r\n_Hutchinson, 1724._--John Hutchinson, who had been employed by Woodward\r\nin making his collection of fossils, published afterwards, in 1724, the\r\nfirst part of his \"Moses's Principia,\" wherein he ridiculed Woodward's\r\nhypothesis. He and his numerous followers were accustomed to declaim\r\nloudly against human learning; and they maintained that the Hebrew\r\nScriptures, when rightly translated, comprised a perfect system of\r\nnatural philosophy, for which reason they objected to the Newtonian\r\ntheory of gravitation.\r\n\r\n_Celsius._--Andrea Celsius, the Swedish astronomer, published about this\r\ntime his remarks on the gradual diminution and sinking of the waters in\r\nthe Baltic, to which I shall have occasion to advert more particularly\r\nin the sequel (ch. 29).\r\n\r\n_Scheuchzer, 1708._--In Germany, in the mean time, Scheuchzer published\r\nhis \"Complaint and Vindication of the Fishes\" (1708), \"Piscium Querelae\r\net Vindiciae,\" a work of zoological merit, in which he gave some good\r\nplates and descriptions of fossil fish. Among other conclusions he\r\nlabored to prove that the earth had been remodelled at the deluge.\r\nPluche, also, in 1732, wrote to the same effect; while Holbach, in 1753,\r\nafter considering the various attempts to refer all the ancient\r\nformations to the flood of Noah, exposed the inadequacy of this cause.\r\n\r\n_Italian Geologists--Vallisneri._--I return with pleasure to the\r\ngeologists of Italy, who preceded, as has been already shown, the\r\nnaturalists of other countries in their investigations into the ancient\r\nhistory of the earth, and who still maintained a decided pre-eminence.\r\nThey refuted and ridiculed the physico-theological systems of Burnet,\r\nWhiston, and Woodward;[70] while Vallisneri,[71] in his comments on the\r\nWoodwardian theory, remarked how much the interests of religion, as well\r\nas those of sound philosophy, had suffered by perpetually mixing up the\r\nsacred writings with questions in physical science. The works of this\r\nauthor were rich in original observations. He attempted the first\r\ngeneral sketch of the marine deposits of Italy, their geographical\r\nextent, and most characteristic organic remains. In his treatise \"On the\r\nOrigin of Springs,\" he explained their dependence on the order, and\r\noften on the dislocations, of the strata, and reasoned philosophically\r\nagainst the opinions of those who regarded the disordered state of the\r\nearth's crust as exhibiting signs of the wrath of God for the sins of\r\nman. He found himself under the necessity of contending, in his\r\npreliminary chapter, against St. Jerome, and four other principal\r\ninterpreters of Scripture, besides several professors of divinity, \"that\r\nsprings did not flow by subterranean siphons and cavities from the sea\r\nupwards, losing their saltness in the passage,\" for this theory had been\r\nmade to rest on the infallible testimony of Holy Writ.\r\n\r\nAlthough reluctant to generalize on the rich materials accumulated in\r\nhis travels, Vallisneri had been so much struck with the remarkable\r\ncontinuity of the more recent marine strata, from one end of Italy to\r\nthe other, that he came to the conclusion that the ocean formerly\r\nextended over the whole earth, and after abiding there for a long time,\r\nhad gradually subsided. This opinion, however untenable, was a great\r\nstep beyond Woodward's diluvian hypothesis, against which Vallisneri,\r\nand after him all the Tuscan geologists, uniformly contended, while it\r\nwas warmly supported by the members of the Institute of Bologna.[72]\r\n\r\nAmong others of that day, Spada, a priest of Grezzana, in 1737, wrote to\r\nprove that the petrified marine bodies near Verona were not\r\ndiluvian.[73] Mattani drew a similar inference from the shells of\r\nVolterra and other places; while Costantini, on the other hand, whose\r\nobservations on the valley of the Brenta and other districts were not\r\nwithout value, undertook to vindicate the truth of the deluge, as also\r\nto prove that Italy had been peopled by the descendants of Japhet.[74]\r\n\r\n_Moro_, 1740.--Lazzaro Moro, in his work (published in 1740) \"On the\r\nMarine Bodies which are found in the Mountains,\"[75] attempted to apply\r\nthe theory of earthquakes, as expounded by Strabo, Pliny, and other\r\nancient authors, with whom he was familiar, to the geological phenomena\r\ndescribed by Vallisneri.[76] His attention was awakened to the\r\nelevating power of subterranean forces by a remarkable phenomenon which\r\nhappened in his own time, and which had also been noticed by Vallisneri\r\nin his letters. A new island rose in 1707 from deep water in the Gulf of\r\nSantorin, in the Mediterranean, during continued shocks of an\r\nearthquake, and, increasing rapidly in size, grew in less than a month\r\nto be half a mile in circumference, and about twenty-five feet above\r\nhigh-water mark. It was soon afterwards covered by volcanic ejections,\r\nbut, when first examined, it was found to be a white rock, bearing on\r\nits surface living oysters and crustacea. In order to ridicule the\r\nvarious theories then in vogue, Moro ingeniously supposes the arrival on\r\nthis new island of a party of naturalists ignorant of its recent origin.\r\nOne immediately points to the marine shells, as proofs of the universal\r\ndeluge; another argues that they demonstrate the former residence of the\r\nsea upon the mountains; a third dismisses them as mere _sports of\r\nnature_; while a fourth affirms that they were born and nourished within\r\nthe rock in ancient caverns, into which salt water had been raised in\r\nthe shape of vapor by the action of subterranean heat.\r\n\r\nMoro pointed with great judgment to the _faults_ and dislocations of the\r\nstrata described by Vallisneri, in the Alps and other chains, in\r\nconfirmation of his doctrine, that the continents had been heaved up by\r\nsubterranean movements. He objected, on solid grounds, to the hypothesis\r\nof Burnet and of Woodward; yet he ventured so far to disregard the\r\nprotest of Vallisneri, as to undertake the adaptation of every part of\r\nhis own system to the Mosaic account of the creation. On the third day,\r\nhe said, the globe was everywhere covered to the same depth by fresh\r\nwater; and when it pleased the Supreme Being that the dry land should\r\nappear, volcanic explosions broke up the smooth and regular surface of\r\nthe earth composed of primary rocks. These rose in mountain masses above\r\nthe waves, and allowed melted metals and salts to ascend through\r\nfissures. The sea gradually acquired its saltness from volcanic\r\nexhalations, and, while it became more circumscribed in area, increased\r\nin depth. Sand and ashes ejected by volcanoes were regularly disposed\r\nalong the bottom of the ocean, and formed the secondary strata, which in\r\ntheir turn were lifted up by earthquakes. We need not follow this author\r\nin tracing the progress of the creation of vegetables and animals on the\r\nother days of creation; but, upon the whole, it may be remarked, that\r\nfew of the old cosmological theories had been conceived with so little\r\nviolation of known analogies.\r\n\r\n_Generelli's illustrations of Moro_, 1749.--The style of Moro was\r\nextremely prolix, and, like Hutton, who, at a later period, advanced\r\nmany of the same views, he stood in need of an illustrator. The Scotch\r\ngeologist was hardly more fortunate in the advocacy of Playfair, than\r\nwas Moro in numbering amongst his admirers Cirillo Generelli, who, nine\r\nyears afterwards, delivered at a sitting of Academicians at Cremona a\r\nspirited exposition of his theory. This learned Carmelitan friar does\r\nnot pretend to have been an original observer, but he had studied\r\nsufficiently to enable him to confirm the opinions of Moro by arguments\r\nfrom other writers; and his selection of the doctrines then best\r\nestablished is so judicious, that a brief abstract of them cannot fail\r\nto be acceptable, as illustrating the state of geology in Europe, and in\r\nItaly in particular, before the middle of the last century.\r\n\r\nThe bowels of the earth, says he, have carefully preserved the memorials\r\nof past events, and this truth the marine productions so frequent in the\r\nhills attest. From the reflections of Lazzaro Moro, we may assure\r\nourselves that these are the effects of earthquakes in past times, which\r\nhave changed vast spaces of sea into terra firma, and inhabited lands\r\ninto seas. In this, more than in any other department of physics, are\r\nobservations and experiments indispensable, and we must diligently\r\nconsider facts. The land is known, wherever we make excavations, to be\r\ncomposed of different strata or soils placed one above the other, some\r\nof sand, some of rock, some of chalk, others of marl, coal, pummice,\r\ngypsum, lime, and the rest. These ingredients are sometimes pure, and\r\nsometimes confusedly intermixed. Within are often imprisoned different\r\nmarine fishes, like dried mummies, and more frequently shells,\r\ncrustacea, corals, plants, &c., not only in Italy, but in France,\r\nGermany, England, Africa, Asia, and America;--sometimes in the lowest,\r\nsometimes in the loftiest beds of the earth, some upon the mountains,\r\nsome in deep mines, others near the sea, and others hundreds of miles\r\ndistant from it. Woodward conjectured that these marine bodies might be\r\nfound everywhere; but there are rocks in which none of them occur, as is\r\nsufficiently attested by Vallisneri and Marsilli. The remains of fossil\r\nanimals consist chiefly of their more solid parts, and the most rocky\r\nstrata must have been soft when such exuviae were inclosed in them.\r\nVegetable productions are found in different states of maturity,\r\nindicating that they were imbedded in different seasons. Elephants,\r\nelks, and other terrestrial quadrupeds, have been found in England and\r\nelsewhere, in superficial strata, never covered by the sea. Alternations\r\nare rare, yet not without example, of marine strata, with those which\r\ncontain marshy and terrestrial productions. Marine animals are arranged\r\nin the subterraneous beds with admirable order, in distinct groups,\r\noysters here, dentalia or corals there, &c., as now, according to\r\nMarsilli,[77] on the shores of the Adriatic. We must abandon the\r\ndoctrine, once so popular, which denies that organized fossils were\r\nderived from living beings, and we cannot account for their present\r\nposition by the ancient theory of Strabo, nor by that of Leibnitz, nor\r\nby the universal deluge, as explained by Woodward and others; \"nor is it\r\nreasonable to call the Deity capriciously upon the stage, and to make\r\nhim work miracles for the sake of confirming our preconceived\r\nhypothesis.\" --\"I hold in utter abomination, most learned Academicians!\r\nthose systems which are built with their foundations in the air, and\r\ncannot be propped up without a miracle; and I undertake, with the\r\nassistance of Moro, to explain to you how these marine animals were\r\ntransported into the mountains by natural causes.\"[78]\r\n\r\nA brief abstract then follows of Moro's theory, by which, says\r\nGenerelli, we may explain all the phenomena, as Vallisneri so ardently\r\ndesired, \"_without violence, without fictions, without hypothesis,\r\nwithout miracles_.\"[79] The Carmelitan then proceeds to struggle against\r\nan obvious objection to Moro's system, considered as a method of\r\nexplaining the revolutions of the earth, _naturally_. If earthquakes\r\nhave been the agents of such mighty changes, how does it happen that\r\ntheir effects since the times of history have been so inconsiderable?\r\nThis same difficulty had, as we have seen, presented itself to Hooke,\r\nhalf a century before, and forced him to resort to a former \"crisis of\r\nnature:\" but Generelli defended his position by showing how numerous\r\nwere the accounts of eruptions and earthquakes, of new islands, and of\r\nelevations and subsidences of land, and yet how much greater a number of\r\nlike events must have been unattested and unrecorded during the last six\r\nthousand years. He also appealed to Vallisneri as an authority to prove\r\nthat the mineral masses containing shells, bore, upon the whole, but a\r\nsmall proportion to those rocks which were destitute of organic remains;\r\nand the latter, says the learned monk, might have been created as they\r\nnow exist, _in the beginning_.\r\n\r\nGenerelli then describes the continual waste of mountains and\r\ncontinents, by the action of rivers and torrents, and concludes with\r\nthese eloquent and original observations:--\"Is it possible that this\r\nwaste should have continued for six thousand, and _perhaps_ a greater\r\nnumber of years, and that the mountains should remain so great, unless\r\ntheir ruins have been repaired? Is it credible that the Author of Nature\r\nshould have founded the world upon such laws, as that the dry land\r\nshould forever be growing smaller, and at last become wholly submerged\r\nbeneath the waters? Is it credible that, amid so many created things,\r\nthe mountains alone should daily diminish in number and bulk, without\r\nthere being any repair of their losses? This would be contrary to that\r\norder of Providence which is seen to reign in all other things in the\r\nuniverse. Wherefore I deem it just to conclude, that the same cause\r\nwhich, in the beginning of time, raised mountains from the abyss, has\r\ndown to the present day continued to produce others, in order to restore\r\nfrom time to time the losses of all such as sink down in different\r\nplaces, or are rent asunder, or in other way suffer disintegration. If\r\nthis be admitted, we can easily understand why there should now be found\r\nupon many mountains so great a number of crustacea and other marine\r\nanimals.\"\r\n\r\nIn the above extract, I have not merely enumerated the opinions and\r\nfacts which are confirmed by recent observation, suppressing all that\r\nhas since proved to be erroneous, but have given a faithful abridgment\r\nof the entire treatise, with the omission only of Moro's hypothesis,\r\nwhich Generelli adopted, with all its faults and excellences. The reader\r\nwill therefore remark, that although this admirable essay embraces so\r\nlarge a portion of the principal objects of geological research, it\r\nmakes no allusion to the extinction of certain classes of animals; and\r\nit is evident that no opinions on this head had, at that time, gained a\r\nfirm footing in Italy. That Lister and other English naturalists should\r\nlong before have declared in favor of the loss of species, while Scilla\r\nand most of his countrymen hesitated, was perhaps natural, since the\r\nItalian museums were filled with fossil shells belonging to species of\r\nwhich a great portion did actually exist in the Mediterranean; whereas\r\nthe English collectors could obtain no recent species from such of their\r\nown strata as were then explored.\r\n\r\nThe weakest point in Moro's system consisted in deriving _all_ the\r\nstratified rocks from volcanic ejections; an absurdity which his\r\nopponents took care to expose, especially Vito Amici.[80] Moro seems to\r\nhave been misled by his anxious desire to represent the formation of\r\nsecondary rocks as having occupied an extremely short period, while at\r\nthe same time he wished to employ known agents in nature. To imagine\r\ntorrents, rivers, currents, partial floods, and all the operations of\r\nmoving water, to have gone on exerting an energy many thousand times\r\ngreater than at present, would have appeared preposterous and\r\nincredible, and would have required a hundred violent hypotheses; but we\r\nare so unacquainted with the true sources of subterranean disturbances,\r\nthat their former violence may in theory be multiplied indefinitely,\r\nwithout its being possible to prove the same manifest contradiction or\r\nabsurdity in the conjecture. For this reason, perhaps, Moro preferred to\r\nderive the materials of the strata from volcanic ejections, rather than\r\nfrom transportation by running water.\r\n\r\n_Marsilli._--Marsilli, whose work is alluded to by Generelli, had been\r\nprompted to institute inquiries into the bed of the Adriatic, by\r\ndiscovering, in the territory of Parma (what Spada had observed near\r\nVerona, and Schiavo in Sicily), that fossil shells were not scattered\r\nthrough the rocks at random, but disposed in regular order, according to\r\ncertain genera and species.\r\n\r\n_Vitaliano Donati_, 1750.--But with a view of throwing further light\r\nupon these questions, Donati, in 1750, undertook a more extensive\r\ninvestigation of the Adriatic, and discovered, by numerous soundings,\r\nthat deposits of sand, marl, and tufaceous incrustations, most strictly\r\nanalogous to those of the Subapennine hills, were in the act of\r\naccumulating there. He ascertained that there were no shells in some of\r\nthe submarine tracts, while in other places they lived together in\r\nfamilies, particularly the genera Arca, Pecten, Venus, Murex, and some\r\nothers. He also states that in divers localities he found a mass\r\ncomposed of corals, shells, and crustaceous bodies of different species,\r\nconfusedly blended with earth, sand, and gravel. At the depth of a foot\r\nor more, the organic substances were entirely petrified and reduced to\r\nmarble; at less than a foot from the surface, they approached nearer to\r\ntheir natural state; while at the surface they were alive, or, if dead,\r\nin a good state of preservation.\r\n\r\n_Baldassari_.--A contemporary naturalist, Baldassari, had shown that the\r\norganic remains in the tertiary marls of the Siennese territory were\r\ngrouped in families, in a manner precisely similar to that above alluded\r\nto by Donati.\r\n\r\n_Buffon_, 1749.--Buffon first made known his theoretical views\r\nconcerning the former changes of the earth, in his Natural History,\r\npublished in 1749. He adopted the theory of an original volcanic\r\nnucleus, together with the universal ocean of Leibnitz. By this aqueous\r\nenvelope the highest mountains were once covered. Marine currents then\r\nacted violently, and formed horizontal strata, by washing away solid\r\nmatter in some parts, and depositing it in others; they also excavated\r\ndeep submarine valleys. The level of the ocean was then depressed by the\r\nentrance of a part of its waters into subterranean caverns, and thus\r\nsome land was left dry. Buffon seems not to have profited, like Leibnitz\r\nand Moro, by the observations of Steno, or he could not have imagined\r\nthat the strata were generally horizontal, and that those which contain\r\norganic remains had never been disturbed since the era of their\r\nformation. He was conscious of the great power annually exerted by\r\nrivers and marine currents in transporting earthy materials to lower\r\nlevels, and he even contemplated the period when they would destroy all\r\nthe present continents. Although in geology he was not an original\r\nobserver, his genius enabled him to render his hypothesis attractive;\r\nand by the eloquence of his style, and the boldness of his speculations,\r\nhe awakened curiosity, and provoked a spirit of inquiry amongst his\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nSoon after the publication of his \"Natural History,\" in which was\r\nincluded his \"Theory of the Earth,\" he received an official letter\r\n(dated January, 1751) from the Sorbonne, or Faculty of Theology in\r\nParis, informing him that fourteen propositions in his works \"were\r\nreprehensible, and contrary to the creed of the church.\" The first of\r\nthese obnoxious passages, and the only one relating to geology, was as\r\nfollows:--\"The waters of the sea have produced the mountains and valleys\r\nof the land--the waters of the heavens, reducing all to a level, will at\r\nlast deliver the whole land over to the sea, and the sea successively\r\nprevailing over the land, will leave dry new continents like those which\r\nwe inhabit.\" Buffon was invited by the College, in very courteous terms,\r\nto send in an explanation, or rather a recantation of his unorthodox\r\nopinions. To this he submitted; and a general assembly of the Faculty\r\nhaving approved of his \"Declaration,\" he was required to publish it in\r\nhis next work. The document begins with these words:--\"I declare that I\r\nhad no intention to contradict the text of Scripture; that I believe\r\nmost firmly all therein related about the creation, both as to order of\r\ntime and matter of fact; and _I abandon every thing in my book\r\nrespecting the foundation of the earth_, and, generally, all which may\r\nbe contrary to the narration of Moses.\"[81]\r\n\r\nThe grand principle which Buffon was called upon to renounce was simply\r\nthis,--that the present mountains and valleys of the earth are due to\r\nsecondary causes, and that the same causes will in time destroy all the\r\ncontinents, hills, and valleys, and reproduce others like them. Now,\r\nwhatever may be the defects of many of his views, it is no longer\r\ncontroverted that the present continents are of secondary origin. The\r\ndoctrine is as firmly established as the earth's rotation on its axis;\r\nand that the land now elevated above the level of the sea will not\r\nendure forever, is an opinion which gains ground daily, in proportion as\r\nwe enlarge our experience of the changes now in progress.\r\n\r\n_Targioni_, 1751.--Targioni, in his voluminous \"Travels in Tuscany, 1751\r\nand 1754,\" labored to fill up the sketch of the geology of that region\r\nleft by Steno sixty years before. Notwithstanding a want of arrangement\r\nand condensation in his memoirs, they contained a rich store of faithful\r\nobservations. He has not indulged in many general views, but in regard\r\nto the origin of valleys, he was opposed to the theory of Buffon, who\r\nattributed them principally to submarine currents. The Tuscan naturalist\r\nlabored to show that both the larger and smaller valleys of the\r\nApennines were excavated by rivers and floods, caused by the bursting of\r\nthe barriers of lakes, after the retreat of the ocean. He also\r\nmaintained that the elephants and other quadrupeds, so frequent in the\r\nlacustrine and alluvial deposits of Italy, had inhabited that peninsula;\r\nand had not been transported thither, as some had conceived, by Hannibal\r\nor the Romans, nor by what they were pleased to term \"a catastrophe of\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\n_Lehman_, 1756.--In the year 1756 the treatise of Lehman, a German\r\nmineralogist, and director of the Prussian mines, appeared, who also\r\ndivided mountains into three classes: the first, those formed with the\r\nworld, and prior to the creation of animals, and which contained no\r\nfragments of other rocks; the second class, those which resulted from\r\nthe partial destruction of the primary rocks by a general revolution;\r\nand a third class, resulting from local revolutions, and in part from\r\nthe deluge of Noah.\r\n\r\nA French translation of this work appeared in 1759, in the preface of\r\nwhich, the translator displays very enlightened views respecting the\r\noperations of earthquakes, as well as of the aqueous causes.[82]\r\n\r\n_Gesner_, 1758.--In this year Gesner, the botanist, of Zurich,\r\npublished an excellent treatise on petrifactions, and the changes of the\r\nearth which they testify.[83] After a detailed enumeration of the\r\nvarious classes of fossils of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and\r\nremarks on the different states in which they are found petrified, he\r\nconsiders the geological phenomena connected with them; observing, that\r\nsome, like those of OEningen, resembled the testacea, fish, and plants\r\nindigenous in the neighboring region;[84] while some, such as ammonites,\r\ngryphites, belemnites, and other shells, are either of unknown species,\r\nor found only in the Indian and other distant seas. In order to\r\nelucidate the structure of the earth, he gives sections, from Verenius,\r\nBuffon, and others, obtained in digging wells; distinguishes between\r\nhorizontal and inclined strata; and, in speculating on the causes of\r\nthese appearances, mentions Donati's examination of the bed of the\r\nAdriatic; the filling up of lakes and seas by sediment; the imbedding of\r\nshells now in progress; and many known effects of earthquakes, such as\r\nthe sinking down of districts, or the heaving up of the bed of the sea,\r\nso as to form new islands, and lay dry strata containing petrifactions.\r\nThe ocean, he says, deserts its shores in many countries, as on the\r\nborders of the Baltic; but the rate of recession has been so slow in the\r\nlast 2000 years, that to allow the Apennines, whose summits are filled\r\nwith marine shells, to emerge to their present height, would have\r\nrequired about 80,000 years,--a lapse of time ten times greater, or\r\nmore, than the age of the universe. We must therefore refer the\r\nphenomenon to the command of the Deity, related by Moses, that \"the\r\nwaters should be gathered together in one place, and the dry land\r\nappear.\" Gesner adopted the views of Leibnitz, to account for the\r\nretreat of the primeval ocean: his essay displays much erudition; and\r\nthe opinions of preceding writers of Italy, Germany, and England, are\r\ncommented upon with fairness and discrimination.\r\n\r\n_Arduino_, 1759.--In the year following, Arduino,[85] in his memoirs on\r\nthe mountains of Padua, Vicenza, and Verona, deduced, from original\r\nobservations, the distinction of rocks into primary, secondary, and\r\ntertiary, and showed that in those districts there had been a succession\r\nof submarine volcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\n_Michell_, 1760.--In the following year (1760) the Rev. John Michell,\r\nWoodwardian Professor of Mineralogy at Cambridge, published in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions, an Essay on the Cause and Phenomena of\r\nEarthquakes.[86] His attention had been drawn to this subject by the\r\ngreat earthquake of Lisbon in 1755. He advanced many original and\r\nphilosophical views respecting the propagation of subterranean\r\nmovements, and the caverns and fissures wherein steam might be\r\ngenerated. In order to point out the application of his theory to the\r\nstructure of the globe, he was led to describe the arrangement and\r\ndisturbance of the strata, their usual horizontality in low countries,\r\nand their contortions and fractured state in the neighborhood of\r\nmountain chains. He also explained, with surprising accuracy, the\r\nrelations of the central ridges of older rocks to the \"long narrow slips\r\nof similar earth, stones, and minerals,\" which are parallel to these\r\nridges. In his generalizations, derived in great part from his own\r\nobservations on the geological structure of Yorkshire, he anticipated\r\nmany of the views more fully developed by later naturalists.\r\n\r\n_Catcott_, 1761.--Michell's papers were entirely free from all\r\nphysico-theological disquisitions, but some of his contemporaries were\r\nstill earnestly engaged in defending or impugning the Woodwardian\r\nhypothesis. We find many of these writings referred to by Catcott, a\r\nHutchinsonian, who published a \"Treatise on the Deluge\" in 1761. He\r\nlabored particularly to refute an explanation offered by his\r\ncontemporary, Bishop Clayton, of the Mosaic writings. That prelate had\r\ndeclared that the deluge \"could not be literally true, save in respect\r\nto that part where Noah lived before the flood.\" Catcott insisted on the\r\nuniversality of the deluge, and referred to traditions of inundations\r\nmentioned by ancient writers, or by travellers, in the East Indies,\r\nChina, South America, and other countries. This part of his book is\r\nvaluable, although it is not easy to see what bearing the traditions\r\nhave, if admitted to be authentic, on the Bishop's argument, since no\r\nevidence is adduced to prove that the catastrophes were contemporaneous\r\nevents, while some of them are expressly represented by ancient authors\r\nto have occurred in succession.\r\n\r\n_Fortis--Odoardi_, 1761.--The doctrines of Arduino, above adverted to,\r\nwere afterwards confirmed by Fortis and Desmarest, in their travels in\r\nthe same country; and they, as well as Baldassari, labored to complete\r\nthe history of the Subapennine strata. In the work of Odoardi,[87] there\r\nwas also a clear argument in favor of the distinct ages of the older\r\nApennine strata, and the Subapennine formations of more recent origin.\r\nHe pointed out that the strata of these two groups were _unconformable_,\r\nand must have been the deposits of different seas at distant periods of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n_Raspe_, 1763.--A history of the new islands, by Raspe, a Hanoverian,\r\nappeared in 1763, in Latin.[88] In this work, all the authentic accounts\r\nof earthquakes which had produced permanent changes on the solid parts\r\nof the earth were collected together and examined with judicious\r\ncriticism. The best systems which had been proposed concerning the\r\nancient history of the globe, both by ancient and modern writers, are\r\nreviewed; and the merits and defects of the doctrines of Hooke, Ray,\r\nMoro, Buffon, and others, fairly estimated. Great admiration is\r\nexpressed for the hypothesis of Hooke, and his explanation of the origin\r\nof the strata is shown to have been more correct than Moro's, while\r\ntheir theory of the effects of earthquakes was the same. Raspe had not\r\nseen Michell's memoirs, and his views concerning the geological\r\nstructure of the earth were perhaps less enlarged; yet he was able to\r\nadd many additional arguments in favor of Hook's theory, and to render\r\nit, as he said, a nearer approach to what Hooke would have written had\r\nhe lived in later times. As to the periods wherein all the earthquakes\r\nhappened, to which we owe the elevation of various parts of our\r\ncontinents and islands, Raspe says he pretends not to assign their\r\nduration, still less to defend Hooke's suggestion, that the convulsions\r\nalmost all took place during the deluge of Noah. He adverts to the\r\napparent indications of the former tropical heat of the climate of\r\nEurope, and the changes in the species of animals and plants, as among\r\nthe most obscure and difficult problems in geology. In regard to the\r\nislands raised from the sea, within the times of history or tradition,\r\nhe declares that some of them were composed of strata containing organic\r\nremains, and that they were not, as Buffon had asserted, made of mere\r\nvolcanic matter. His work concludes with an eloquent exhortation to\r\nnaturalists to examine the isles which rose, in 1707, in the Grecian\r\nArchipelago, and, in 1720, in the Azores, and not to neglect such\r\nsplendid opportunities of studying nature \"in the act of parturition.\"\r\nThat Hooke's writings should have been neglected for more than half a\r\ncentury, was matter of astonishment to Raspe; but it is still more\r\nwonderful that his own luminous exposition of that theory should, for\r\nmore than another half century, have excited so little interest.\r\n\r\n_Fuchsel_, 1762 and 1773.--Fuchsel, a German physician, published, in\r\n1762, a geological description of the country between the Thuringerwald\r\nand the Hartz, and a memoir on the environs of Rudelstadt;[89] and\r\nafterwards, in 1773, a theoretical work on the ancient history of the\r\nearth and of man.[90] He had evidently advanced considerably beyond his\r\npredecessor Lehman, and was aware of the distinctness, both as to\r\nposition and fossil contents, of several groups of strata of different\r\nages, corresponding to the secondary formations now recognized by\r\ngeologists in various parts of Germany. He supposed the European\r\ncontinents to have remained covered by the sea until the formation of\r\nthe marine strata, called in Germany \"muschelkalk,\" at the same time\r\nthat the terrestrial plants of many European deposits, attested the\r\nexistence of dry land which bordered the ancient sea; land which,\r\ntherefore, must have occupied the place of the present ocean. The\r\npre-existing continent had been _gradually_ swallowed up by the sea,\r\ndifferent parts having subsided in succession into subterranean caverns.\r\nAll the sedimentary strata were originally horizontal, and their present\r\nstate of derangement must be referred to subsequent oscillations of the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAs there were plants and animals in the ancient periods, so also there\r\nmust have been men, but they did not all descend from one pair, but were\r\ncreated at various points on the earth's surface; and the number of\r\nthese distinct birth-places was as great as are the original languages\r\nof nations.\r\n\r\nIn the writings of Fuchsel we see a strong desire manifested to explain\r\ngeological phenomena as far as possible by reference to the agency of\r\nknown causes; and although some of his speculations were fanciful, his\r\nviews coincide much more nearly with those now generally adopted, than\r\nthe theories afterwards promulgated by Werner and his followers.\r\n\r\n_Brander_, 1766.--Gustavus Brander published, in 1766, his \"Fossilia\r\nHantoniensia,\" containing excellent figures of fossil shells from the\r\nmore modern (or Eocene) marine strata of Hampshire. \"Various opinions,\"\r\nhe says in the preface, \"had been entertained concerning the time when\r\nand how these bodies became deposited. Some there are who conceive that\r\nit might have been effected in a wonderful length of time by a gradual\r\nchanging and shifting of the sea,\" &c. But the most common cause\r\nassigned is that of \"the deluge.\" This conjecture, he says, even if the\r\nuniversality of the flood be not called in question, is purely\r\nhypothetical. In his opinion, fossil animals and testacea were, for the\r\nmost part, of unknown species; and of such as were known, the living\r\nanalogues now belonged to southern latitudes.\r\n\r\n_Soldani_, 1780.--Soldani applied successfully his knowledge of zoology\r\nto illustrate the history of stratified masses. He explained that\r\nmicroscopic testacea and zoophytes inhabited the depths of the\r\nMediterranean; and that the fossil species were, in like manner, found\r\nin those deposits wherein the fineness of their particles, and the\r\nabsence of pebbles, implied that they were accumulated in a deep sea, or\r\nfar from shore. This author first remarked the alternation of marine and\r\nfreshwater strata in the Paris basin.[91]\r\n\r\n_Fortis--Testa_, 1793.--A lively controversy arose between Fortis and\r\nanother Italian naturalist, Testa, concerning the fish of Monte Bolca,\r\nin 1793. Their letters,[92] written with great spirit and elegance, show\r\nthat they were aware that a large proportion of the Subapennine shells\r\nwere identical with living species, and some of them with species now\r\nliving in the torrid zone. Fortis proposed a somewhat fanciful\r\nconjecture, that when the volcanoes of the Vicentin were burning, the\r\nwaters of the Adriatic had a higher temperature; and in this manner, he\r\nsaid, the shells of warmer regions may once have peopled their own seas.\r\nBut Testa was disposed to think that these species of testacea were\r\nstill common to their own and to equinoctial seas; for many, he said,\r\nonce supposed to be confined to hotter regions, had been afterwards\r\ndiscovered in the Mediterranean.[93]\r\n\r\n_Cortesi--Spallanzani--Wallerius--Whitehurst._--While these Italian\r\nnaturalists, together with Cortesi and Spallanzani, were busily engaged\r\nin pointing out the analogy between the deposits of modern and ancient\r\nseas, and the habits and arrangement of their organic inhabitants, and\r\nwhile some progress was making, in the same country, in investigating\r\nthe ancient and modern volcanic rocks, some of the most original\r\nobservers among the English and German writers, Whitehurst[94] and\r\nWallerius, were wasting their strength in contending, according to the\r\nold Woodwardian hypothesis, that all the strata were formed by Noah's\r\ndeluge. But Whitehurst's description of the rocks of Derbyshire was most\r\nfaithful; and he atoned for false theoretical views, by providing data\r\nfor their refutation.\r\n\r\n_Pallas--Saussure._--Towards the close of the eighteenth century, the\r\nidea of distinguishing the mineral masses on our globe into separate\r\ngroups, and studying their relations, began to be generally diffused.\r\nPallas and Saussure were among the most celebrated whose labors\r\ncontributed to this end. After an attentive examination of the two great\r\nmountain chains of Siberia, Pallas announced the result, that the\r\ngranitic rocks were in the middle, the schistose at their sides, and the\r\nlimestones again on the outside of these; and this he conceived would\r\nprove a general law in the formation of all chains composed chiefly of\r\nprimary rocks.[95]\r\n\r\nIn his \"Travels in Russia,\" in 1793 and 1794, he made many geological\r\nobservations on the recent strata near the Wolga and the Caspian, and\r\nadduced proofs of the greater extent of the latter sea at no distant era\r\nin the earth's history. His memoir on the fossil bones of Siberia\r\nattracted attention to some of the most remarkable phenomena in geology.\r\nHe stated that he had found a rhinoceros entire in the frozen soil, with\r\nits skin and flesh: an elephant, found afterwards in a mass of ice on\r\nthe shore of the North Sea, removed all doubt as to the accuracy of so\r\nwonderful a discovery.[96]\r\n\r\nThe subjects relating to natural history which engaged the attention of\r\nPallas, were too multifarious to admit of his devoting a large share of\r\nhis labors exclusively to geology. Saussure, on the other hand, employed\r\nthe chief portion of his time in studying the structure of the Alps and\r\nJura, and he provided valuable data for those who followed him. He did\r\nnot pretend to deduce any general system from his numerous and\r\ninteresting observations; and the few theoretical opinions which escaped\r\nfrom him, seem, like those of Pallas, to have been chiefly derived from\r\nthe cosmological speculations of preceding writers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE PROGRESS OF GEOLOGY--_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Werner's application of geology to the art of\r\n     mining--Excursive character of his lectures--Enthusiasm of his\r\n     pupils--His authority--His theoretical errors--Desmarest's Map\r\n     and Description of Auvergne--Controversy between the\r\n     Vulcanists and Neptunists--Intemperance of the rival\r\n     sects--Hutton's Theory of the earth--His discovery of granite\r\n     veins--Originality of his views--Why opposed--Playfair's\r\n     illustrations--Influence of Voltaire's writings on\r\n     geology--Imputations cast on the Huttonians by Williams,\r\n     Kirwan, and De Luc--Smith's Map of England--Geological Society\r\n     of London--Progress of the science in France--Growing\r\n     importance of the study of organic remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Werner._--The art of mining has long been taught in France, Germany,\r\nand Hungary, in scientific institutions established for that purpose,\r\nwhere mineralogy has always been a principal branch of instruction.\r\n\r\nWerner was named, in 1775, professor of that science in the \"School of\r\nMines,\" at Freyberg, in Saxony. He directed his attention not merely to\r\nthe composition and external characters of minerals, but also to what he\r\ntermed \"geognosy,\" or the natural position of minerals in particular\r\nrocks, together with the grouping of those rocks, their geographical\r\ndistribution, and various relations. The phenomena observed in the\r\nstructure of the globe had hitherto served for little else than to\r\nfurnish interesting topics for philosophical discussion; but when Werner\r\npointed out their application to the practical purposes of mining, they\r\nwere instantly regarded by a large class of men as an essential part of\r\ntheir professional education, and from that time the science was\r\ncultivated in Europe more ardently and systematically. Werner's mind was\r\nat once imaginative and richly stored with miscellaneous knowledge. He\r\nassociated every thing with his favorite science, and in his excursive\r\nlectures, he pointed out all the economical uses of minerals, and their\r\napplication to medicine; the influence of the mineral composition of\r\nrocks upon the soil, and of the soil upon the resources, wealth, and\r\ncivilization of man. The vast sandy plains of Tartary and Africa, he\r\nwould say, retained their inhabitants in the shape of wandering\r\nshepherds; the granitic mountains and the low calcareous and alluvial\r\nplains gave rise to different manners, degrees of wealth, and\r\nintelligence. The history even of languages, and the migration of\r\ntribes, had been determined by the direction of particular strata. The\r\nqualities of certain stones used in building would lead him to descant\r\non the architecture of different ages and nations; and the physical\r\ngeography of a country frequently invited him to treat of military\r\ntactics. The charm of his manners and his eloquence kindled enthusiasm\r\nin the minds of his pupils; and many, who had intended at first only to\r\nacquire a slight knowledge of mineralogy, when they had once heard him,\r\ndevoted themselves to it as the business of their lives. In a few years,\r\na small school of mines, before unheard of in Europe, was raised to the\r\nrank of a great university; and men already distinguished in science\r\nstudied the German language, and came from the most distant countries to\r\nhear the great oracle of geology.[97]\r\n\r\nWerner had a great antipathy to the mechanical labor of writing, and,\r\nwith the exception of a valuable treatise on metalliferous veins, he\r\ncould never be persuaded to pen more than a few brief memoirs, and those\r\ncontaining no development of his general views. Although the natural\r\nmodesty of his disposition was excessive, approaching even to timidity,\r\nhe indulged in the most bold and sweeping generalizations, and he\r\ninspired all his scholars with a most implicit faith in his doctrines.\r\nTheir admiration of his genius, and the feelings of gratitude and\r\nfriendship which they all felt for him, were not undeserved; but the\r\nsupreme authority usurped by him over the opinions of his\r\ncontemporaries, was eventually prejudicial to the progress of the\r\nscience; so much so, as greatly to counterbalance the advantages which\r\nit derived from his exertions. If it be true that delivery be the first,\r\nsecond, and third requisite in a popular orator, it is no less certain,\r\nthat to travel is of first, second, and third importance to those who\r\ndesire to originate just and comprehensive views concerning the\r\nstructure of our globe. Now Werner had not travelled to distant\r\ncountries; he had merely explored a small portion of Germany, and\r\nconceived, and persuaded others to believe, that the whole surface of\r\nour planet, and all the mountain chains in the world, were made after\r\nthe model of his own province. It became a ruling object of ambition in\r\nthe minds of his pupils to confirm the generalizations of their great\r\nmaster, and to discover in the most distant parts of the globe his\r\n\"universal formations,\" which he supposed had been each in succession\r\nsimultaneously precipitated over the whole earth from a common\r\nmenstruum, or \"chaotic fluid.\" It now appears that the Saxon professor\r\nhad misinterpreted many of the most important appearances even in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of Freyberg. Thus, for example, within a day's\r\njourney of his school, the porphyry, called by him primitive, has been\r\nfound not only to send forth veins or dikes through strata of the coal\r\nformation, but to overlie them in mass. The granite of the Hartz\r\nmountains, on the other hand, which he supposed to be the nucleus of the\r\nchain, is now well known to traverse the other beds, as near Goslar; and\r\nstill nearer Freyberg, in the Erzgebirge, the mica slate does not mantle\r\nround the granite as was supposed, but abuts abruptly against it.\r\nFragments, also, of the greywacka slate, containing organic remains,\r\nhave recently been found entangled in the granite of the Hartz, by M. de\r\nSeckendorf.[98]\r\n\r\nThe principal merit of Werner's system of instruction consisted in\r\nsteadily directing the attention of his scholars to the constant\r\nrelations of superposition of certain mineral groups; but he had been\r\nanticipated, as has been shown in the last chapter, in the discovery of\r\nthis general law, by several geologists in Italy and elsewhere; and his\r\nleading divisions of the secondary strata were at the same time, and\r\nindependently, made the basis of an arrangement of the British strata by\r\nour countryman, William Smith, to whose work I shall refer in the\r\nsequel.\r\n\r\n_Controversy between the Vulcanists and Neptunists._--In regard to\r\nbasalt and other igneous rocks, Werner's theory was original, but it was\r\nalso extremely erroneous. The basalts of Saxony and Hesse, to which his\r\nobservations were chiefly confined, consisted of tabular masses capping\r\nthe hills, and not connected with the levels of existing valleys, like\r\nmany in Auvergne and the Vivarais. These basalts, and all other rocks of\r\nthe same family in other countries, were, according to him, chemical\r\nprecipitates from water. He denied that they were the products of\r\nsubmarine volcanoes; and even taught that, in the primeval ages of the\r\nworld, there were no volcanoes. His theory was opposed, in a twofold\r\nsense, to the doctrine of the permanent agency of the same causes in\r\nnature; for not only did he introduce, without scruple, many imaginary\r\ncauses supposed to have once effected great revolutions in the earth,\r\nand then to have become extinct, but new ones also were feigned to have\r\ncome into play in modern times; and, above all, that most violent\r\ninstrument of change, the agency of subterranean heat.\r\n\r\nSo early as 1768, before Werner had commenced his mineralogical studies,\r\nRaspe had truly characterized the basalts of Hesse as of igneous origin.\r\nArduino, we have seen, had pointed out numerous varieties of trap-rock\r\nin the Vicentin as analogous to volcanic products, and as distinctly\r\nreferable to ancient submarine eruptions. Desmarest, as before stated,\r\nhad, in company with Fortis, examined the Vicentin in 1766, and\r\nconfirmed Arduino's views. In 1772, Banks, Solander, and Troil compared\r\nthe columnar basalt of Hecla with that of the Hebrides. Collini, in\r\n1774, recognized the true nature of the igneous rocks on the Rhine,\r\nbetween Andernach and Bonn. In 1775, Guettard visited the Vivarais, and\r\nestablished the relation of basaltic currents to lavas. Lastly, in 1779,\r\nFaujas published his description of the volcanoes of the Vivarais and\r\nVelay, and showed how the streams of basalt had poured out from craters\r\nwhich still remain in a perfect state.[99]\r\n\r\n_Desmarest._--When sound opinions had thus for twenty years prevailed in\r\nEurope concerning the true nature of the ancient trap-rocks, Werner by\r\nhis simple dictum caused a retrograde movement, and not only overturned\r\nthe true theory, but substituted for it one of the most unphilosophical\r\nthat can well be imagined. The continued ascendancy of his dogmas on\r\nthis subject was the more astonishing, because a variety of new and\r\nstriking facts were daily accumulated in favor of the correct opinions\r\npreviously entertained. Desmarest, after a careful examination of\r\nAuvergne, pointed out, first, the most recent volcanoes which had their\r\ncraters still entire, and their streams of lava conforming to the level\r\nof the present river-courses. He then showed that there were others of\r\nan intermediate epoch, whose craters were nearly effaced, and whose\r\nlavas were less intimately connected with the present valleys; and,\r\nlastly, that there were volcanic rocks, still more ancient, without any\r\ndiscernible craters or scoriae, and bearing the closest analogy to rocks\r\nin other parts of Europe, the igneous origin of which was denied by the\r\nschool of Freyberg.[100]\r\n\r\nDesmarest's map of Auvergne was a work of uncommon merit. He first made\r\na trigonometrical survey of the district, and delineated its physical\r\ngeography with minute accuracy and admirable graphic power. He\r\ncontrived, at the same time, to express without the aid of colors, many\r\ngeological details, including the different ages and sometimes even the\r\nstructure, of the volcanic rocks, and distinguishing them from the\r\nfresh-water and the granitic. They alone who have carefully studied\r\nAuvergne, and traced the different lava streams from their craters to\r\ntheir termination,--the various isolated basaltic cappings,--the\r\nrelation of some lavas to the present valleys,---the absence of such\r\nrelations in others,--can appreciate the extraordinary fidelity of this\r\nelaborate work. No other district of equal dimensions in Europe\r\nexhibits, perhaps, so beautiful and varied a series of phenomena; and,\r\nfortunately, Desmarest possessed at once the mathematical knowledge\r\nrequired for the construction of a map, skill in mineralogy, and a power\r\nof original generalization.\r\n\r\n_Dolomieu--Montlosier._--Dolomieu, another of Werner's contemporaries,\r\nhad found prismatic basalt among the ancient lavas of Etna; and, in\r\n1784, had observed the alternations of submarine lavas and calcareous\r\nstrata in the Val di Noto, in Sicily.[101] In 1790, also, he described\r\nsimilar phenomena in the Vicentin and in the Tyrol.[102] Montlosier\r\npublished, in 1788, an essay on the theories of volcanoes of Auvergne,\r\ncombining accurate local observations with comprehensive views.\r\nNotwithstanding this mass of evidence the scholars of Werner were\r\nprepared to support his opinions to their utmost extent; maintaining, in\r\nthe fulness of their faith, that even obsidian was an aqueous\r\nprecipitate. As they were blinded by their veneration for the great\r\nteacher, they were impatient of opposition, and soon imbibed the spirit\r\nof a faction; and their opponents, the Vulcanists, were not long in\r\nbecoming contaminated with the same intemperate zeal. Ridicule and irony\r\nwere weapons more frequently employed than argument by the rival sects,\r\ntill at last the controversy was carried on with a degree of bitterness\r\nalmost unprecedented in questions of physical science. Desmarest alone,\r\nwho had long before provided ample materials for refuting such a theory,\r\nkept aloof from the strife; and whenever a zealous Neptunist wished to\r\ndraw the old man into an argument, he was satisfied with replying, \"Go\r\nand see.\"[103]\r\n\r\n_Hutton_, 1788.--It would be contrary to all analogy, in matters of\r\ngraver import, that a war should rage with such fury on the Continent,\r\nand that the inhabitants of our island should not mingle in the affray.\r\nAlthough in England the personal influence of Werner was wanting to\r\nstimulate men to the defence of the weaker side of the question, they\r\ncontrived to find good reason for espousing the Wernerian errors with\r\ngreat enthusiasm. In order to explain the peculiar motives which led\r\nmany to enter, even with party feeling, into this contest, it will be\r\nnecessary to present the reader with a sketch of the views unfolded by\r\nHutton, a contemporary of the Saxon geologist. The former naturalist had\r\nbeen educated as a physician, but declining the practice of medicine, he\r\nresolved, when young, to remain content with the small independence\r\ninherited from his father, and thenceforth to give his undivided\r\nattention to scientific pursuits. He resided at Edinburgh, where he\r\nenjoyed the society of many men of high attainments, who loved him for\r\nthe simplicity of his manners, and the sincerity of his character. His\r\napplication was unwearied; and he made frequent tours through different\r\nparts of England and Scotland, acquiring considerable skill as a\r\nmineralogist, and consequently arriving at grand and comprehensive views\r\nin geology. He communicated the results of his observations\r\nunreservedly, and with the fearless spirit of one who was conscious that\r\nlove of truth was the sole stimulus of his exertions. When at length he\r\nhad matured his views, he published, in 1788, his \"Theory of the\r\nEarth,\"[104] and the same, afterwards more fully developed in a separate\r\nwork, in 1795. This treatise was the first in which geology was declared\r\nto be in no way concerned about \"questions as to the origin of things;\"\r\nthe first in which an attempt was made to dispense entirely with all\r\nhypothetical causes, and to explain the former changes of the earth's\r\ncrust by reference exclusively to natural agents. Hutton labored to\r\ngive fixed principles to geology, as Newton had succeeded in doing to\r\nastronomy; but, in the former science, too little progress had been made\r\ntowards furnishing the necessary data, to enable any philosopher,\r\nhowever great his genius, to realize so noble a project.\r\n\r\n_Huttonian theory._--\"The ruins of an older world,\" said Hutton, \"are\r\nvisible in the present structure of our planet; and the strata which now\r\ncompose our continents have been once beneath the sea, and were formed\r\nout of the waste of pre-existing continents. The same forces are still\r\ndestroying, by chemical decomposition or mechanical violence, even the\r\nhardest rocks, and transporting the materials to the sea, where they are\r\nspread out, and form strata analogous to those of more ancient date.\r\nAlthough loosely deposited along the bottom of the ocean, they become\r\nafterwards altered and consolidated by volcanic heat, and then heaved\r\nup, fractured, and contorted.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Hutton had never explored any region of active volcanoes, he\r\nhad convinced himself that basalt and many other trap-rocks were of\r\nigneous origin, and that many of them had been injected in a melted\r\nstate through fissures in the older strata. The compactness of these\r\nrocks, and their different aspect from that of ordinary lava, he\r\nattributed to their having cooled down under the pressure of the sea;\r\nand in order to remove the objections started against this theory, his\r\nfriend, Sir James Hall, instituted a most curious and instructive series\r\nof chemical experiments, illustrating the crystalline arrangement and\r\ntexture assumed by melted matter cooled under high pressure.\r\n\r\nThe absence of stratification in granite, and its analogy, in mineral\r\ncharacter, to rocks which he deemed of igneous origin, led Hutton to\r\nconclude that granite also must have been formed from matter in fusion;\r\nand this inference he felt could not be fully confirmed, unless he\r\ndiscovered at the contact of granite and other strata a repetition of\r\nthe phenomena exhibited so constantly by the trap-rocks. Resolved to try\r\nhis theory by this test, he went to the Grampians, and surveyed the line\r\nof junction of the granite and superincumbent stratified masses, until\r\nhe found in Glen Tilt, in 1785, the most clear and unequivocal proofs in\r\nsupport of his views. Veins of red granite are there seen branching out\r\nfrom the principal mass, and traversing the black micaceous schist and\r\nprimary limestone. The intersected stratified rocks are so distinct in\r\ncolor and appearance as to render the example in that locality most\r\nstriking, and the alteration of the limestone in contact was very\r\nanalogous to that produced by trap veins on calcareous strata. This\r\nverification of his system filled him with delight, and called forth\r\nsuch marks of joy and exultation, that the guides who accompanied him,\r\nsays his biographer, were convinced that he must have discovered a vein\r\nof silver or gold.[105] He was aware that the same theory would not\r\nexplain the origin of the primary schists, but these he called primary,\r\nrejecting the term primitive, and was disposed to consider them as\r\nsedimentary rocks altered by heat, and that they originated in some\r\nother form from the waste of previously existing rocks.\r\n\r\nBy this important discovery of granite veins, to which he had been led\r\nby fair induction from an independent class of facts, Hutton prepared\r\nthe way for the greatest innovation of the systems of his predecessors.\r\nVallisneri had pointed out the general fact that there were certain\r\nfundamental rocks which contained no organic remains, and which he\r\nsupposed to have been formed before the creation of living beings. Moro,\r\nGenerelli, and other Italian writers, embraced the same doctrine; and\r\nLehman regarded the mountains called by him primitive, as parts of the\r\noriginal nucleus of the globe. The same tenet was an article of faith in\r\nthe school of Freyberg; and if any one ventured to doubt the possibility\r\nof our being enabled to carry back our researches to the creation of the\r\npresent order of things, the granitic rocks were triumphantly appealed\r\nto. On them seemed written, in legible characters, the memorable\r\ninscription--\r\n\r\n  \"Dinanzi a me non fur cose create\r\n  Se non eterne;\"[106]\r\n\r\nand no small sensation was excited when Hutton seemed, with unhallowed\r\nhand, desirous to erase characters already regarded by many as sacred.\r\n\"In the economy of the world,\" said the Scotch geologist, \"I can find no\r\ntraces of a beginning, no prospect of an end;\" a declaration the more\r\nstartling when coupled with the doctrine, that all past ages on the\r\nglobe had been brought about by the slow agency of existing causes. The\r\nimagination was first fatigued and overpowered by endeavoring to\r\nconceive the immensity of time required for the annihilation of whole\r\ncontinents by so insensible a process; and when the thoughts had\r\nwandered through these interminable periods, no resting-place was\r\nassigned in the remotest distance. The oldest rocks were represented to\r\nbe of a derivative nature, the last of an antecedent series, and that,\r\nperhaps, one of many pre-existing worlds. Such views of the immensity of\r\npast time, like those unfolded by the Newtonian philosophy in regard to\r\nspace, were too vast to awaken ideas of sublimity unmixed with a painful\r\nsense of our incapacity to conceive a plan of such infinite extent.\r\nWorlds are seen beyond worlds immeasurably distant from each other, and,\r\nbeyond them all, innumerable other systems are faintly traced on the\r\nconfines of the visible universe.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic feature of the Huttonian theory was, as before\r\nhinted, the exclusion of all causes not supposed to belong to the\r\npresent order of nature. But Hutton had made no step beyond Hooke, Moro,\r\nand Raspe, in pointing out in what manner the laws now governing\r\nsubterranean movements might bring about geological changes, if\r\nsufficient time be allowed. On the contrary, he seems to have fallen far\r\nshort of some of their views, especially when he refused to attribute\r\nany part of the external configuration of the earth's crust to\r\nsubsidence. He imagined that the continents were first gradually\r\ndestroyed by aqueous degradation; and when their ruins had furnished\r\nmaterials for new continents, they were upheaved by violent convulsions.\r\nHe therefore required alternate periods of general disturbance and\r\nrepose; and such he believed had been, and would forever be, the course\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\nGenerelli, in his exposition of Moro's system, had made a far nearer\r\napproximation towards reconciling geological appearances with the state\r\nof nature as known to us; for while he agreed with Hutton, that the\r\ndecay and reproduction of rocks were always in progress, proceeding with\r\nthe utmost uniformity, the learned Carmelite represented the repairs of\r\nmountains by elevation from below to be effected by an equally constant\r\nand synchronous operation. Neither of these theories, considered singly,\r\nsatisfies all the conditions of the great problem, which a geologist,\r\nwho rejects cosmological causes, is called upon to solve; but they\r\nprobably contain together the germs of a perfect system. There can be no\r\ndoubt, that periods of disturbance and repose have followed each other\r\nin succession in every region of the globe; but it may be equally true,\r\nthat the energy of the subterranean movements has been always uniform as\r\nregards the _whole earth_. The force of earthquakes may for a cycle of\r\nyears have been invariably confined, as it is now, to large but\r\ndeterminate spaces, and may then have gradually shifted its position, so\r\nthat another region, which had for ages been at rest, became in its turn\r\nthe grand theatre of action.\r\n\r\n_Playfair's illustrations of Hutton._--The explanation proposed by\r\nHutton, and by Playfair, the illustrator of his theory, respecting the\r\norigin of valleys and of alluvial accumulations, was also very\r\nimperfect. They ascribed none of the inequalities of the earth's surface\r\nto movements which accompanied the upheaving of the land, imagining that\r\nvalleys in general were formed in the course of ages by the rivers now\r\nflowing in them; while they seem not to have reflected on the excavating\r\nand transporting power which the waves of the ocean might exert on land\r\nduring its emergence.\r\n\r\nAlthough Hutton's knowledge of mineralogy and chemistry was\r\nconsiderable, he possessed but little information concerning organic\r\nremains; they merely served him, as they did Werner, to characterize\r\ncertain strata, and to prove their marine origin. The theory of former\r\nrevolutions in organic life was not yet fully recognized; and without\r\nthis class of proofs in support of the antiquity of the globe, the\r\nindefinite periods demanded by the Huttonian hypothesis appeared\r\nvisionary to many; and some, who deemed the doctrine inconsistent with\r\nrevealed truths, indulged very uncharitable suspicions of the motives of\r\nits author. They accused him of a deliberate design of reviving the\r\nheathen dogma of an \"eternal succession,\" and of denying that this world\r\never had a beginning. Playfair, in the biography of his friend, has the\r\nfollowing comment on this part of their theory:--\"In the planetary\r\nmotions, where geometry has carried the eye so far, both into the future\r\nand the past, we discover no mark either of the commencement or\r\ntermination of the present order. It is unreasonable, indeed, to suppose\r\nthat such marks should anywhere exist. The Author of Nature has not\r\ngiven laws to the universe, which, like the institutions of men, carry\r\nin themselves the elements of their own destruction. He has not\r\npermitted in His works any symptom of infancy or of old age, or any sign\r\nby which we may estimate either their future or their past duration. _He\r\nmay put an end, as he no doubt gave a beginning_, to the present system,\r\nat some determinate period of time; but we may rest assured that this\r\ngreat catastrophe will not be brought about by the laws now existing,\r\nand that it is not indicated, by any thing which we perceive.\"[107]\r\n\r\nThe party feeling excited against the Huttonian doctrines, and the open\r\ndisregard of candor and temper in the controversy, will hardly be\r\ncredited by the reader, unless he recalls to his recollection that the\r\nmind of the English public was at that time in a state of feverish\r\nexcitement. A class of writers in France had been laboring industriously\r\nfor many years, to diminish the influence of the clergy, by sapping the\r\nfoundations of the Christian faith; and their success, and the\r\nconsequences of the Revolution, had alarmed the most resolute minds,\r\nwhile the imagination of the more timid was continually haunted by dread\r\nof innovation, as by the phantom of some fearful dream.\r\n\r\n_Voltaire._--Voltaire had used the modern discoveries in physics as one\r\nof the numerous weapons of attack and ridicule directed by him against\r\nthe Scriptures. He found that the most popular systems of geology were\r\naccommodated to the sacred writings, and that much ingenuity had been\r\nemployed to make every fact coincide exactly with the Mosaic account of\r\nthe creation and deluge. It was, therefore, with no friendly feelings\r\nthat he contemplated the cultivators of geology in general, regarding\r\nthe science as one which had been successfully enlisted by theologians\r\nas an ally in their cause.[108] He knew that the majority of those who\r\nwere aware of the abundance of fossil shells in the interior of\r\ncontinents, were still persuaded that they were proofs of the universal\r\ndeluge; and as the readiest way of shaking this article of faith, he\r\nendeavored to inculcate skepticism as to the real nature of such shells,\r\nand to recall from contempt the exploded dogma of the sixteenth century,\r\nthat they were sports of nature. He also pretended that vegetable\r\nimpressions were not those of real plants.[109] Yet he was perfectly\r\nconvinced that the shells had really belonged to living testacea, as may\r\nbe seen in his essay \"On the formation of Mountains.\"[110] He would\r\nsometimes, in defiance of all consistency, shift his ground when\r\naddressing the vulgar; and, admitting the true nature of the shells\r\ncollected in the Alps and other places, pretend that they were Eastern\r\nspecies, which had fallen from the hats of pilgrims coming from Syria.\r\nThe numerous essays written by him on geological subjects were all\r\ncalculated to strengthen prejudices, partly because he was ignorant of\r\nthe real state of the science, and partly from his bad faith.[111] On\r\nthe other hand, they who knew that his attacks were directed by a desire\r\nto invalidate Scripture, and who were unacquainted with the true merits\r\nof the question, might well deem the old diluvian hypothesis\r\nincontrovertible, if Voltaire could adduce no better argument against it\r\nthan to deny the true nature of organic remains.\r\n\r\nIt is only by careful attention to impediments originating in extrinsic\r\ncauses, that we can explain the slow and reluctant adoption of the\r\nsimplest truths in geology. First, we find many able naturalists\r\nadducing the fossil remains of marine animals as proofs of an event\r\nrelated in Scripture. The evidence is deemed conclusive by the multitude\r\nfor a century or more; for it favors opinions which they entertained\r\nbefore, and they are gratified by supposing them confirmed by fresh and\r\nunexpected proofs. Many who see through the fallacy have no wish to\r\nundeceive those who are influenced by it, approving the effect of the\r\ndelusion, and conniving at it as a pious fraud; until, finally, an\r\nopposite party, who are hostile to the sacred writings, labor to explode\r\nthe erroneous opinion, by substituting for it another dogma, which they\r\nknow to be equally unsound.\r\n\r\nThe heretical Vulcanists were soon after openly assailed in England, by\r\nimputations of the most illiberal kind. We cannot estimate the\r\nmalevolence of such a persecution, by the pain which similar\r\ninsinuations might now inflict; for although charges of infidelity and\r\natheism must always be odious, they were injurious in the extreme at\r\nthat moment of political excitement; and it was better, perhaps, for a\r\nman's good reception in society, that his moral character should have\r\nbeen traduced, than that he should become a mark for these poisoned\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nI shall pass over the works of numerous divines, who may be excused for\r\nsensitiveness on points which then excited so much uneasiness in the\r\npublic mind; and shall say nothing of the amiable poet Cowper,[112] who\r\ncould hardly be expected to have inquired into the merit of doctrines\r\nin physics. But in the foremost ranks of the intolerant are found\r\nseveral laymen who had high claims to scientific reputation. Among these\r\nappears Williams, a mineral surveyor of Edinburgh, who published a\r\n\"Natural History of the Mineral Kingdom,\" in 1789; a work of great\r\nmerit, for that day, and of practical utility, as containing the best\r\naccount of the coal strata. In his preface he misrepresents Hutton's\r\ntheory altogether, and charges him with considering all rocks to be\r\nlavas of different colors and structure; and also with \"warping every\r\nthing to support the eternity of the world.\"[113] He descants on the\r\npernicious influence of such skeptical notions, as leading to downright\r\ninfidelity and atheism, \"and as being nothing less than to depose the\r\nAlmighty Creator of the universe from his office.\"[114]\r\n\r\n_Kirwan_--_De Luc._--Kirwan, president of the Royal Academy of Dublin, a\r\nchemist and mineralogist of some merit, but who possessed much greater\r\nauthority in the scientific world than he was entitled by his talents to\r\nenjoy, said, in the introduction to his \"Geological Essays, 1799,\" \"that\r\n_sound_ geology _graduated_ into religion, and was required to dispel\r\ncertain systems of atheism or infidelity, of which they had had recent\r\nexperience.\"[115] He was an uncompromising defender of the aqueous\r\ntheory of all rocks, and was scarcely surpassed by Burnet and Whiston,\r\nin his desire to adduce the Mosaic writings in confirmation of his\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nDe Luc, in the preliminary discourse to his Treatise on Geology,[116]\r\nsays, \"The weapons have been changed by which revealed religion is\r\nattacked; it is now assailed by geology, and the knowledge of this\r\nscience has become essential to theologians.\" He imputes the failure of\r\nformer geological systems to their having been anti-Mosaical, and\r\ndirected against a \"sublime tradition.\" These and similar imputations,\r\nreiterated in the works of De Luc, seem to have been taken for granted\r\nby some modern writers: it is therefore necessary to state, in justice\r\nto the numerous geologists of different nations, whose works have been\r\nconsidered, that none of them were guilty of endeavoring, by arguments\r\ndrawn from physics, to invalidate scriptural tenets. On the contrary,\r\nthe majority of those who were fortunate enough \"to discover the true\r\ncauses of things,\" rarely deserved another part of the poet's panegyric,\r\n\"_Atque metus omnes subjecit pedibus_.\" The caution and even timid\r\nreserve, of many eminent Italian authors of the earlier period is very\r\napparent; and there can hardly be a doubt, that they subscribed to\r\ncertain dogmas, and particularly to the first diluvian theory, out of\r\ndeference to popular prejudices, rather than from conviction. If they\r\nwere guilty of dissimulation, we may feel regret, but must not blame\r\ntheir want of moral courage, reserving rather our condemnation for the\r\nintolerance of the times, and that inquisitorial power which forced\r\nGalileo to abjure, and the two Jesuits to disclaim the theory of\r\nNewton.[117]\r\n\r\nHutton answered Kirwan's attacks with great warmth, and with the\r\nindignation justly excited by unmerited reproach. \"He had always\r\ndisplayed,\" says Playfair, \"the utmost disposition to admire the\r\nbeneficent design manifested in the structure of the world; and he\r\ncontemplated with delight those parts of his theory which made the\r\ngreatest additions to our knowledge of final causes.\" We may say with\r\nequal truth, that in no scientific works in our language can more\r\neloquent passages be found, concerning the fitness, harmony, and\r\ngrandeur of all parts of the creation, than in those of Playfair. They\r\nare evidently the unaffected expressions of a mind, which contemplated\r\nthe study of nature, as best calculated to elevate our conceptions of\r\nthe attributes of the First Cause. At any other time the force and\r\nelegance of Playfair's style must have insured popularity to the\r\nHuttonian doctrines; but by a singular coincidence, Neptunianism and\r\northodoxy were now associated in the same creed; and the tide of\r\nprejudice ran so strong, that the majority were carried far away into\r\nthe chaotic fluid, and other cosmological inventions of Werner. These\r\nfictions the Saxon professor had borrowed with little modification, and\r\nwithout any improvement, from his predecessors. They had not the\r\nsmallest foundation either in Scripture or in common sense, and were\r\nprobably approved of by many as being so ideal and unsubstantial, that\r\nthey could never come into violent collision with any preconceived\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nAccording to De Luc, the first essential distinction to be made between\r\nthe various phenomena exhibited on the surface of the earth was, to\r\ndetermine which were the results of causes still in action, and which\r\nhad been produced by causes that had ceased to act. The form and\r\ncomposition of the mass of our continents, he said, and their existence\r\nabove the level of the sea, must be ascribed to causes no longer in\r\naction. These continents emerged, at no very remote period, on the\r\nsudden retreat of the ocean, the waters of which made their way into\r\nsubterranean caverns. The formation of the rocks which enter into the\r\ncrust of the earth began with the precipitation of granite from a\r\nprimordial liquid, after which other strata containing the remains of\r\norganized bodies were deposited, till at last the present sea remained\r\nas the residuum of the primordial liquid, and no longer continued to\r\nproduce mineral strata.[118]\r\n\r\n_William Smith_, 1790.--While the tenets of the rival schools of\r\nFreyberg and Edinburgh were warmly espoused by devoted partisans, the\r\nlabors of an individual, unassisted by the advantages of wealth or\r\nstation in society, were almost unheeded. Mr. William Smith, an English\r\nsurveyor, published his \"Tabular View of the British Strata\" in 1790,\r\nwherein he proposed a classification of the secondary formations in the\r\nWest of England. Although he had not communicated with Werner, it\r\nappeared by this work that he had arrived at the same views respecting\r\nthe laws of superposition of stratified rocks; that he was aware that\r\nthe order of succession of different groups was never inverted; and that\r\nthey might be identified at very distant points by their peculiar\r\norganized fossils.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the appearance of the \"Tabular View,\" the author\r\nlabored to construct a geological map of the whole of England; and with\r\nthe greatest disinterestedness of mind, communicated the results of his\r\ninvestigations to all who desired information, giving such publicity to\r\nhis original views, as to enable his contemporaries almost to compete\r\nwith him in the race. The execution of his map was completed in 1815,\r\nand remains a lasting monument of original talent and extraordinary\r\nperseverance; for he had explored the whole country on foot, without the\r\nguidance of previous observers, or the aid of fellow-laborers, and had\r\nsucceeded in throwing into natural divisions the whole complicated\r\nseries of British rocks. D'Aubuisson, a distinguished pupil of Werner,\r\npaid a just tribute of praise to this remarkable performance, observing,\r\nthat \"what many celebrated mineralogists had only accomplished for a\r\nsmall part of Germany in the course of half a century, had been effected\r\nby a single individual for the whole of England.\"[119]\r\n\r\nWerner invented a new language to express his divisions of rocks, and\r\nsome of his technical terms, such as grauwacke, gneiss, and others,\r\npassed current in every country in Europe. Smith adopted for the most\r\npart English provincial terms, often of barbarous sound, such as gault,\r\ncornbrash, clunch clay; and affixed them to subdivisions of the British\r\nseries. Many of these still retain their place in our scientific\r\nclassifications, and attest his priority of arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN PROGRESS OF GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThe contention of the rival factions of the Vulcanists and Neptunists\r\nhad been carried to such a height, that these names had become terms of\r\nreproach; and the two parties had been less occupied in searching for\r\ntruth, than for such arguments as might strengthen their own cause or\r\nserve to annoy their antagonists. A new school at last arose, who\r\nprofessed the strictest neutrality, and the utmost indifference to the\r\nsystems of Werner and Hutton, and who resolved diligently to devote\r\ntheir labors to observation. The reaction, provoked by the intemperance\r\nof the conflicting parties, now produced a tendency to extreme caution.\r\nSpeculative views were discountenanced, and, through fear of exposing\r\nthemselves to the suspicion of a bias towards the dogmas of a party,\r\nsome geologists became anxious to entertain no opinion whatever on the\r\ncauses of phenomena, and were inclined to skepticism even where the\r\nconclusions deducible from observed facts scarcely admitted of\r\nreasonable doubt.\r\n\r\n_Geological Society of London._--But although the reluctance to theorize\r\nwas carried somewhat to excess, no measure could be more salutary at\r\nsuch a moment than a suspension of all attempts to form what were termed\r\n\"theories of the earth.\" A great body of new data were required; and the\r\nGeological Society of London, founded in 1807, conduced greatly to the\r\nattainment of this desirable end. To multiply and record observations,\r\nand patiently to await the result at some future period, was the object\r\nproposed by them; and it was their favorite maxim that the time was not\r\nyet come for a general system of geology, but that all must be content\r\nfor many years to be exclusively engaged in furnishing materials for\r\nfuture generalizations. By acting up to these principles with\r\nconsistency, they in a few years disarmed all prejudice, and rescued the\r\nscience from the imputation of being a dangerous, or at best but a\r\nvisionary pursuit.\r\n\r\nA distinguished modern writer has with truth remarked, that the\r\nadvancement of three of the main divisions of geological inquiry have\r\nduring the last half century been promoted successively by three\r\ndifferent nations of Europe,--the Germans, the English, and the\r\nFrench.[120] We have seen that the systematic study of what may be\r\ncalled mineralogical geology had its origin and chief point of activity\r\nin Germany, where Werner first described with precision the mineral\r\ncharacters of rocks. The classification of the secondary formations,\r\neach marked by their peculiar fossils, belongs, in a great measure, to\r\nEngland, where the labors before alluded to of Smith, and those of the\r\nmost active members of the Geological Society of London, were steadily\r\ndirected to these objects. The foundation of the third branch, that\r\nrelating to the tertiary formations, was laid in France by the splendid\r\nwork of Cuvier and Brongniart, published in 1808, \"On the Mineral\r\nGeography and Organic Remains of the Neighborhood of Paris.\"\r\n\r\nWe may still trace, in the language of the science and our present\r\nmethods of arrangement, the various countries where the growth of these\r\nseveral departments of geology was at different times promoted. Many\r\nnames of simple minerals and rocks remain to this day German; while the\r\nEuropean divisions of the secondary strata are in great part English,\r\nand are, indeed, often founded too exclusively on English types. Lastly,\r\nthe subdivisions first established of the succession of strata in the\r\nParis basin have served as normal groups to which other tertiary\r\ndeposits throughout Europe have been compared, even in cases where this\r\nstandard was wholly inapplicable.\r\n\r\nNo period could have been more fortunate for the discovery, in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of Paris, of a rich store of well-preserved\r\nfossils, than the commencement of the present century; for at no former\r\nera had Natural history been cultivated with such enthusiasm in the\r\nFrench metropolis. The labors of Cuvier in comparative osteology, and of\r\nLamarck in recent and fossil shells, had raised these departments of\r\nstudy to a rank of which they had never previously been deemed\r\nsusceptible. Their investigations had eventually a powerful effect in\r\ndispelling the illusion which had long prevailed concerning the absence\r\nof analogy between the ancient and modern state of our planet. A close\r\ncomparison of the recent and fossil species and the inferences drawn in\r\nregard to their habits, accustomed the geologist to contemplate the\r\nearth as having been at successive periods the dwelling-place of animals\r\nand plants of different races, some terrestrial, and others\r\naquatic--some fitted to live in seas, others in the waters of lakes and\r\nrivers. By the consideration of these topics, the mind was slowly and\r\ninsensibly withdrawn from imaginary pictures of catastrophes and chaotic\r\nconfusion, such as haunted the imagination of the early cosmogonists.\r\nNumerous proofs were discovered of the tranquil deposition of\r\nsedimentary matter, and the slow development of organic life. If many\r\nwriters, and Cuvier himself in the number, still continued to maintain,\r\nthat \"the thread of induction was broken,\"[121] yet, in reasoning by the\r\nstrict rules of induction from recent to fossil species, they in a great\r\nmeasure disclaimed the dogma which in theory they professed. The\r\nadoption of the same generic, and, in some cases, even of the same\r\nspecific, names for the exuviae of fossil animals and their living\r\nanalogues, was an important step towards familiarizing the mind with the\r\nidea of the identity and unity of the system in distant eras. It was an\r\nacknowledgment, as it were, that part at least of the ancient memorials\r\nof nature were written in a living language. The growing importance,\r\nthen, of the natural history of organic remains may be pointed out as\r\nthe characteristic feature of the progress of the science during the\r\npresent century. This branch of knowledge has already become an\r\ninstrument of great utility in geological classification, and is\r\ncontinuing daily to unfold new data for grand and enlarged views\r\nrespecting the former changes of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the result of observations in the last fifty years with\r\nthose of the three preceding centuries, we cannot but look forward with\r\nthe most sanguine expectations to the degree of excellence to which\r\ngeology may be carried, even by the labors of the present generation.\r\nNever, perhaps, did any science, with the exception of astronomy,\r\nunfold, in an equally brief period, so many novel and unexpected truths,\r\nand overturn so many preconceived opinions. The senses had for ages\r\ndeclared the earth to be at rest, until the astronomer taught that it\r\nwas carried through space with inconceivable rapidity. In like manner\r\nwas the surface of this planet regarded as having remained unaltered\r\nsince its creation, until the geologist proved that it had been the\r\ntheatre of reiterated change, and was still the subject of slow but\r\nnever-ending fluctuations. The discovery of other systems in the\r\nboundless regions of space was the triumph of astronomy; to trace the\r\nsame system through various transformations--to behold it at successive\r\neras adorned with different hills and valleys, lakes and seas, and\r\npeopled with new inhabitants, was the delightful meed of geological\r\nresearch. By the geometer were measured the regions of space, and the\r\nrelative distances of the heavenly bodies;--by the geologist myriads of\r\nages were reckoned, not by arithmetical computation, but by a train of\r\nphysical events--a succession of phenomena in the animate and inanimate\r\nworlds--signs which convey to our minds more definite ideas than figures\r\ncan do of the immensity of time.\r\n\r\nWhether our investigation of the earth's history and structure will\r\neventually be productive of as great practical benefits to mankind as a\r\nknowledge of the distant heavens, must remain for the decision of\r\nposterity. It was not till astronomy had been enriched by the\r\nobservations of many centuries, and had made its way against popular\r\nprejudices to the establishment of a sound theory, that its application\r\nto the useful arts was most conspicuous. The cultivation of geology\r\nbegan at a later period; and in every step which it has hitherto made\r\ntowards sound theoretical principles, it had to contend against more\r\nviolent prepossessions. The practical advantages already derived from it\r\nhave not been inconsiderable; but our generalizations are yet imperfect,\r\nand they who come after us may be expected to reap the most valuable\r\nfruits of our labor. Meanwhile, the charm of first discovery is our own;\r\nand, as we explore this magnificent field of inquiry, the sentiment of a\r\ngreat historian of our times may continually be present to our minds,\r\nthat \"he who calls what has vanished back again into being, enjoys a\r\nbliss like that of creating.\"[122]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPREJUDICES WHICH HAVE RETARDED THE PROGRESS OF GEOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\n  Prepossessions in regard to the duration of past time--Prejudices\r\n    arising from our peculiar position as inhabitants of the land--Of\r\n    those occasioned by our not seeing subterranean changes now in\r\n    progress--All these causes combine to make the former course of\r\n    Nature appear different from the present--Objections to the\r\n    doctrine, that causes similar in kind and energy to those now\r\n    acting, have produced the former changes of the earth's surface,\r\n    considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we reflect on the history of the progress of geology, as explained in\r\nthe preceding chapters, we perceive that there have been great\r\nfluctuations of opinion respecting the nature of the causes to which\r\nall former changes of the earth's surface are referable. The first\r\nobservers conceived the monuments which the geologist endeavors to\r\ndecipher to relate to an original state of the earth, or to a period\r\nwhen there were causes in activity, distinct, in kind and degree, from\r\nthose now constituting the economy of nature. These views were gradually\r\nmodified, and some of them entirely abandoned, in proportion as\r\nobservations were multiplied, and the signs of former mutations more\r\nskilfully interpreted. Many appearances, which had for a long time been\r\nregarded as indicating mysterious and extraordinary agency, were finally\r\nrecognized as the necessary result of the laws now governing the\r\nmaterial world; and the discovery of this unlooked-for conformity has at\r\nlength induced some philosophers to infer, that, during the ages\r\ncontemplated in geology, there has never been any interruption to the\r\nagency of the same uniform laws of change. The same assemblage of\r\ngeneral causes, they conceive, may have been sufficient to produce, by\r\ntheir various combinations, the endless diversity of effects, of which\r\nthe shell of the earth has preserved the memorials; and, consistently\r\nwith these principles, the recurrence of analogous changes is expected\r\nby them in time to come.\r\n\r\nWhether we coincide or not in this doctrine, we must admit that the\r\ngradual progress of opinion concerning the succession of phenomena in\r\nvery remote eras, resembles, in a singular manner, that which has\r\naccompanied the growing intelligence of every people, in regard to the\r\neconomy of nature in their own times. In an early state of advancement,\r\nwhen a great number of natural appearances are unintelligible, an\r\neclipse, an earthquake, a flood, or the approach of a comet, with many\r\nother occurrences afterwards found to belong to the regular course of\r\nevents, are regarded as prodigies. The same delusion prevails as to\r\nmoral phenomena, and many of these are ascribed to the intervention of\r\ndemons, ghosts, witches, and other immaterial and supernatural agents.\r\nBy degrees, many of the enigmas of the moral and physical world are\r\nexplained, and, instead of being due to extrinsic and irregular causes,\r\nthey are found to depend on fixed and invariable laws. The philosopher\r\nat last becomes convinced of the undeviating uniformity of secondary\r\ncauses; and, guided by his faith in this principle, he determines the\r\nprobability of accounts transmitted to him of former occurrences, and\r\noften rejects the fabulous tales of former times, on the ground of their\r\nbeing irreconcilable with the experience of more enlightened ages.\r\n\r\n_Prepossessions in regard to the duration of past time._--As a belief in\r\nthe want of conformity in the causes by which the earth's crust has been\r\nmodified in ancient and modern periods was, for a long time, universally\r\nprevalent, and that, too, amongst men who were convinced that the order\r\nof nature had been uniform for the last several thousand years, every\r\ncircumstance which could have influenced their minds and given an undue\r\nbias to their opinions deserves particular attention. Now the reader\r\nmay easily satisfy himself, that, however undeviating the course of\r\nnature may have been from the earliest epochs, it was impossible for the\r\nfirst cultivators of geology to come to such a conclusion, so long as\r\nthey were under a delusion as to the age of the world, and the date of\r\nthe first creation of animate beings. However fantastical some theories\r\nof the sixteenth century may now appear to us,--however unworthy of men\r\nof great talent and sound judgment,--we may rest assured that, if the\r\nsame misconception now prevailed in regard to the memorials of human\r\ntransactions, it would give rise to a similar train of absurdities. Let\r\nus imagine, for example, that Champollion, and the French and Tuscan\r\nliterati lately engaged in exploring the antiquities of Egypt, had\r\nvisited that country with a firm belief that the banks of the Nile were\r\nnever peopled by the human race before the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and that their faith in this dogma was as difficult to shake as\r\nthe opinion of our ancestors that the earth was never the abode of\r\nliving beings until the creation of the present continents, and of the\r\nspecies now existing,--it is easy to perceive what extravagant systems\r\nthey would frame, while under the influence of this delusion, to account\r\nfor the monuments discovered in Egypt. The sight of the pyramids,\r\nobelisks, colossal statues, and ruined temples, would fill them with\r\nsuch astonishment, that for a time they would be as men\r\nspell-bound--wholly incapable of reasoning with sobriety. They might\r\nincline at first to refer the construction of such stupendous works to\r\nsome superhuman powers of a primeval world. A system might be invented\r\nresembling that so gravely advanced by Manetho, who relates that a\r\ndynasty of gods originally ruled in Egypt, of whom Vulcan, the first\r\nmonarch, reigned nine thousand years; after whom came Hercules and other\r\ndemigods, who were at last succeeded by human kings.\r\n\r\nWhen some fanciful speculations of this kind had amused their\r\nimaginations for a time, some vast repository of mummies would be\r\ndiscovered, and would immediately undeceive those antiquaries who\r\nenjoyed an opportunity of personally examining them; but the prejudices\r\nof others at a distance, who were not eye-witnesses of the whole\r\nphenomena, would not be so easily overcome. The concurrent report of\r\nmany travellers would, indeed, render it necessary for them to\r\naccommodate ancient theories to some of the new facts, and much wit and\r\ningenuity would be required to modify and defend their old positions.\r\nEach new invention would violate a greater number of known analogies;\r\nfor if a theory be required to embrace some false principle, it becomes\r\nmore visionary in proportion as facts are multiplied, as would be the\r\ncase if geometers were now required to form an astronomical system on\r\nthe assumption of the immobility of the earth.\r\n\r\nAmongst other fanciful conjectures concerning the history of Egypt, we\r\nmay suppose some of the following to be started. \"As the banks of the\r\nNile have been so recently colonized for the first time, the curious\r\nsubstances called mummies could never in reality have belonged to men.\r\nThey may have been generated by some _plastic virtue_ residing in the\r\ninterior of the earth, or they may be abortions of Nature produced by\r\nher incipient efforts in the work of creation. For if deformed beings\r\nare sometimes born even now, when the scheme of the universe is fully\r\ndeveloped, many more may have been 'sent before their time, scarce half\r\nmade up,' when the planet itself was in the embryo state. But if these\r\nnotions appear to derogate from the perfection of the Divine attributes,\r\nand if these mummies be in all their parts true representations of the\r\nhuman form, may we not refer them to the future rather than the\r\npast?--May we not be looking into the womb of Nature, and not her grave?\r\nMay not these images be like the shades of the unborn in Virgil's\r\nElysium--the archetypes of men not yet called into existence?\"\r\n\r\nThese speculations, if advocated by eloquent writers, would not fail to\r\nattract many zealous votaries, for they would relieve men from the\r\npainful necessity of renouncing preconceived opinions. Incredible as\r\nsuch skepticism may appear, it has been rivalled by many systems of the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and among others by that of the\r\nlearned Falloppio, who regarded the tusks of fossil elephants as earthy\r\nconcretions, and the pottery or fragments of vases in the Monte\r\nTestaceo, near Rome, as works of nature, and not of art. But when one\r\ngeneration had passed away, and another, not compromised to the support\r\nof antiquated dogmas, had succeeded, they would review the evidence\r\nafforded by mummies more impartially, and would no longer controvert the\r\npreliminary question, that human beings had lived in Egypt before the\r\nnineteenth century: so that when a hundred years perhaps had been lost,\r\nthe industry and talents of the philosopher would be at last directed to\r\nthe elucidation of points of real historical importance.\r\n\r\nBut the above arguments are aimed against one only of many prejudices\r\nwith which the earlier geologists had to contend. Even when they\r\nconceded that the earth had been peopled with animate beings at an\r\nearlier period than was at first supposed, they had no conception that\r\nthe quantity of time bore so great a proportion to the historical era as\r\nis now generally conceded. How fatal every error as to the quantity of\r\ntime must prove to the introduction of rational views concerning the\r\nstate of things in former ages, may be conceived by supposing the annals\r\nof the civil and military transactions of a great nation to be perused\r\nunder the impression that they occurred in a period of one hundred\r\ninstead of two thousand years. Such a portion of history would\r\nimmediately assume the air of a romance; the events would seem devoid of\r\ncredibility, and inconsistent with the present course of human affairs.\r\nA crowd of incidents would follow each other in thick succession. Armies\r\nand fleets would appear to be assembled only to be destroyed, and cities\r\nbuilt merely to fall in ruins. There would be the most violent\r\ntransitions from foreign or intestine war to periods of profound peace,\r\nand the works effected during the years of disorder or tranquillity\r\nwould appear alike superhuman in magnitude.\r\n\r\nHe who should study the monuments of the natural world under the\r\ninfluence of a similar infatuation, must draw a no less exaggerated\r\npicture of the energy and violence of causes, and must experience the\r\nsame insurmountable difficulty in reconciling the former and present\r\nstate of nature. If we could behold in one view all the volcanic cones\r\nthrown up in Iceland, Italy, Sicily, and other parts of Europe, during\r\nthe last five thousand years, and could see the lavas which have flowed\r\nduring the same period; the dislocations, subsidences, and elevations\r\ncaused during earthquakes; the lands added to various deltas, or\r\ndevoured by the sea, together with the effects of devastation by floods,\r\nand imagine that all these events had happened in one year, we must form\r\nmost exalted ideas of the activity of the agents, and the suddenness of\r\nthe revolutions. Were an equal amount of change to pass before our eyes\r\nin the next year, could we avoid the conclusion that some great crisis\r\nof nature was at hand? If geologists, therefore, have misinterpreted the\r\nsigns of a succession of events, so as to conclude that centuries were\r\nimplied where the characters imported thousands of years, and thousands\r\nof years where the language of Nature signified millions, they could\r\nnot, if they reasoned logically from such false premises, come to any\r\nother conclusion than that the system of the natural world had undergone\r\na complete revolution.\r\n\r\nWe should be warranted in ascribing the erection of the great pyramid to\r\nsuperhuman power, if we were convinced that it was raised in one day;\r\nand if we imagine, in the same manner, a continent or mountain-chain to\r\nhave been elevated during an equally small fraction of the time which\r\nwas really occupied in upheaving it, we might then be justified in\r\ninferring, that the subterranean movements were once far more energetic\r\nthan in our own times. We know that during one earthquake the coast of\r\nChili may be raised for a hundred miles to the average height of about\r\nthree feet. A repetition of two thousand shocks, of equal violence,\r\nmight produce a mountain-chain one hundred miles long, and six thousand\r\nfeet high. Now, should one or two only of these convulsions happen in a\r\ncentury, it would be consistent with the order of events experienced by\r\nthe Chilians from the earliest times; but if the whole of them were to\r\noccur in the next hundred years, the entire district must be\r\ndepopulated, scarcely any animals or plants could survive, and the\r\nsurface would be one confused heap of ruin and desolation.\r\n\r\nOne consequence of undervaluing greatly the quantity of past time, is\r\nthe apparent coincidence which it occasions of events necessarily\r\ndisconnected, or which are so unusual, that it would be inconsistent\r\nwith all calculation of chances to suppose them to happen at one and the\r\nsame time. When the unlooked-for association of such rare phenomena is\r\nwitnessed in the present course of nature, it scarcely ever fails to\r\nexcite a suspicion of the preternatural in those minds which are not\r\nfirmly convinced of the uniform agency of secondary causes;--as if the\r\ndeath of some individual in whose fate they are interested happens to\r\nbe accompanied by the appearance of a luminous meteor, or a comet, or\r\nthe shock of an earthquake. It would be only necessary to multiply such\r\ncoincidences indefinitely, and the mind of every philosopher would be\r\ndisturbed. Now it would be difficult to exaggerate the number of\r\nphysical events, many of them most rare and unconnected in their nature,\r\nwhich were imagined by the Woodwardian hypothesis to have happened in\r\nthe course of a few months; and numerous other examples might be found\r\nof popular geological theories, which require us to imagine that a long\r\nsuccession of events happened in a brief and almost momentary period.\r\n\r\nAnother liability to error, very nearly allied to the former, arises\r\nfrom the frequent contact of geological monuments referring to very\r\ndistant periods of time. We often behold, at one glance, the effects of\r\ncauses which have acted at times incalculably remote, and yet there may\r\nbe no striking circumstances to mark the occurrence of a great chasm in\r\nthe chronological series of Nature's archives. In the vast interval of\r\ntime which may really have elapsed between the results of operations\r\nthus compared, the physical condition of the earth may, by slow and\r\ninsensible modifications, have become entirely altered; one or more\r\nraces of organic beings may have passed away, and yet have left behind,\r\nin the particular region under contemplation, no trace of their\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nTo a mind unconscious of these intermediate events, the passage from one\r\nstate of things to another must appear so violent, that the idea of\r\nrevolutions in the system inevitably suggests itself. The imagination is\r\nas much perplexed by the deception, as it might be if two distant points\r\nin space were suddenly brought into immediate proximity. Let us suppose,\r\nfor a moment, that a philosopher should lie down to sleep in some arctic\r\nwilderness, and then be transferred by a power, such as we read of in\r\ntales of enchantment, to a valley in a tropical country, where, on\r\nawaking, he might find himself surrounded by birds of brilliant plumage,\r\nand all the luxuriance of animal and vegetable forms of which Nature is\r\nso prodigal in those regions. The most reasonable supposition, perhaps,\r\nwhich he could make, if by the necromancer's art he were placed in such\r\na situation, would be, that he was dreaming; and if a geologist form\r\ntheories under a similar delusion, we cannot expect him to preserve more\r\nconsistency in his speculations than in the train of ideas in an\r\nordinary dream.\r\n\r\nIt may afford, perhaps, a lively illustration of the principle here\r\ninsisted upon, if I recall to the reader's recollection the legend of\r\nthe Seven Sleepers. The scene of that popular fable was placed in the\r\ntwo centuries which elapsed between the reign of the emperor Decius and\r\nthe death of Theodosius the younger. In that interval of time (between\r\nthe years 249 and 450 of our era) the union of the Roman Empire had been\r\ndissolved, and some of its fairest provinces overrun by the barbarians\r\nof the north. The seat of government had passed from Rome to\r\nConstantinople, and the throne from a pagan persecutor to a succession\r\nof Christian and orthodox princes. The genius of the empire had been\r\nhumbled in the dust, and the altars of Diana and Hercules were on the\r\npoint of being transferred to Catholic saints and martyrs. The legend\r\nrelates, \"that when Decius was still persecuting the Christians, seven\r\nnoble youths of Ephesus concealed themselves in a spacious cavern in the\r\nside of an adjacent mountain, where they were doomed to perish by the\r\ntyrant, who gave orders that the entrance should be firmly secured with\r\na pile of huge stones. They immediately fell into a deep slumber, which\r\nwas miraculously prolonged, without injuring the powers of life, during\r\na period of 187 years. At the end of that time the slaves of Adolius, to\r\nwhom the inheritance of the mountain had descended, removed the stones\r\nto supply materials for some rustic edifice: the light of the sun darted\r\ninto the cavern, and the Seven Sleepers were permitted to awake. After a\r\nslumber, as they thought, of a few hours, they were pressed by the calls\r\nof hunger, and resolved that Jamblichus, one of their number, should\r\nsecretly return to the city to purchase bread for the use of his\r\ncompanions. The youth could no longer recognize the once familiar aspect\r\nof his native country, and his surprise was increased by the appearance\r\nof a large cross triumphantly erected over the principal gate of\r\nEphesus. His singular dress and obsolete language confounded the baker,\r\nto whom he offered an ancient medal of Decius as the current coin of the\r\nempire; and Jamblichus, on the suspicion of a secret treasure, was\r\ndragged before the judge. Their mutual inquiries produced the amazing\r\ndiscovery, that two centuries were almost elapsed since Jamblichus and\r\nhis friends had escaped from the rage of a pagan tyrant.\"[123]\r\n\r\nThis legend was received as authentic throughout the Christian world\r\nbefore the end of the sixth century, and was afterwards introduced by\r\nMahomet as a divine revelation into the Koran, and from hence was\r\nadopted and adorned by all the nations from Bengal to Africa who\r\nprofessed the Mahometan faith. Some vestiges even of a similar tradition\r\nhave been discovered in Scandinavia. \"This easy and universal belief,\"\r\nobserves the philosophical historian of the Decline and Fall, \"so\r\nexpressive of the sense of mankind, may be ascribed to the genuine merit\r\nof the fable itself. We imperceptibly advance from youth to age, without\r\nobserving the gradual, but incessant, change of human affairs; and even,\r\nin our larger experience of history, the imagination is accustomed, by a\r\nperpetual series of causes and effects, to unite the most distant\r\nrevolutions. But if the interval between two memorable eras could be\r\ninstantly annihilated; if it were possible, after a momentary slumber of\r\ntwo hundred years, to display the new world to the eyes of a spectator\r\nwho still retained a lively and recent impression of the old, his\r\nsurprise and his reflections would furnish the pleasing subject of a\r\nphilosophical romance.\"[124]\r\n\r\n_Prejudices arising from our peculiar position as inhabitants of the\r\nland._--The sources of prejudice hitherto considered may be deemed\r\npeculiar for the most part to the infancy of the science, but others\r\nare common to the first cultivators of geology and to ourselves, and are\r\nall singularly calculated to produce the same deception, and to\r\nstrengthen our belief that the course of nature in the earlier ages\r\ndiffered widely from that now established. Although these circumstances\r\ncannot be fully explained without assuming some things as proved, which\r\nit will be the object of another part of this work to demonstrate, it\r\nmay be well to allude to them briefly in this place.\r\n\r\nThe first and greatest difficulty, then, consists in an habitual\r\nunconsciousness that our position as observers is essentially\r\nunfavorable, when we endeavor to estimate the nature and magnitude of\r\nthe changes now in progress. In consequence of our inattention to this\r\nsubject, we are liable to serious mistakes in contrasting the present\r\nwith former states of the globe. As dwellers on the land, we inhabit\r\nabout a fourth part of the surface; and that portion is almost\r\nexclusively a theatre of decay, and not of reproduction. We know,\r\nindeed, that new deposits are annually formed in seas and lakes, and\r\nthat every year some new igneous rocks are produced in the bowels of the\r\nearth, but we cannot watch the progress of their formation; and as they\r\nare only present to our minds by the aid of reflection, it requires an\r\neffort both of the reason and the imagination to appreciate duly their\r\nimportance. It is, therefore, not surprising that we estimate very\r\nimperfectly the result of operations thus invisible to us; and that,\r\nwhen analogous results of former epochs are presented to our inspection,\r\nwe cannot immediately recognize the analogy. He who has observed the\r\nquarrying of stone from a rock, and has seen it shipped for some distant\r\nport, and then endeavors to conceive what kind of edifice will be raised\r\nby the materials, is in the same predicament as a geologist, who, while\r\nhe is confined to the land, sees the decomposition of rocks, and the\r\ntransportation of matter by rivers to the sea, and then endeavors to\r\npicture to himself the new strata which Nature is building beneath the\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n_Prejudices arising from our not seeing subterranean changes._--Nor is\r\nhis position less unfavorable when, beholding a volcanic eruption, he\r\ntries to conceive what changes the column of lava has produced, in its\r\npassage upwards, on the intersected strata; or what form the melted\r\nmatter may assume at great depths on cooling; or what may be the extent\r\nof the subterranean rivers and reservoirs of liquid matter far beneath\r\nthe surface. It should, therefore, be remembered, that the task imposed\r\non those who study the earth's history requires no ordinary share of\r\ndiscretion; for we are precluded from collating the corresponding parts\r\nof the system of things as it exists now, and as it existed at former\r\nperiods. If we were inhabitants of another element--if the great ocean\r\nwere our domain, instead of the narrow limits of the land, our\r\ndifficulties would be considerably lessened; while, on the other hand,\r\nthere can be little doubt, although the reader may, perhaps, smile at\r\nthe bare suggestion of such an idea, that an amphibious being, who\r\nshould possess our faculties, would still more easily arrive at sound\r\ntheoretical opinions in geology, since he might behold, on the one\r\nhand, the decomposition of rocks in the atmosphere, or the\r\ntransportation of matter by running water; and, on the other, examine\r\nthe deposition of sediment in the sea, and the imbedding of animal and\r\nvegetable remains in new strata. He might ascertain, by direct\r\nobservation, the action of a mountain torrent, as well as of a marine\r\ncurrent; might compare the products of volcanoes poured out upon the\r\nland with those ejected beneath the waters; and might mark, on the one\r\nhand, the growth of the forest, and, on the other, that of the coral\r\nreef. Yet, even with these advantages, he would be liable to fall into\r\nthe greatest errors, when endeavoring to reason on rocks of subterranean\r\norigin. He would seek in vain, within the sphere of his observation, for\r\nany direct analogy to the process of their formation, and would\r\ntherefore be in danger of attributing them, wherever they are upraised\r\nto view, to some \"primeval state of nature.\"\r\n\r\nBut if we may be allowed so far to indulge the imagination, as to\r\nsuppose a being entirely confined to the nether world--some \"dusky\r\nmelancholy sprite,\" like Umbriel, who could \"flit on sooty pinions to\r\nthe central earth,\" but who was never permitted to \"sully the fair face\r\nof light,\" and emerge into the regions of water and of air; and if this\r\nbeing should busy himself in investigating the structure of the globe,\r\nhe might frame theories the exact converse of those usually adopted by\r\nhuman philosophers. He might infer that the stratified rocks, containing\r\nshells and other organic remains, were the oldest of created things,\r\nbelonging to some original and nascent state of the planet. \"Of these\r\nmasses,\" he might say, \"whether they consist of loose incoherent sand,\r\nsoft clay, or solid stone, none have been formed in modern times. Every\r\nyear some part of them are broken and shattered by earthquakes, or\r\nmelted by volcanic fire; and when they cool down slowly from a state of\r\nfusion, they assume a new and more crystalline form, no longer\r\nexhibiting that stratified disposition and those curious impressions and\r\nfantastic markings, by which they were previously characterized. This\r\nprocess cannot have been carried on for an indefinite time, for in that\r\ncase all the stratified rocks would long ere this have been fused and\r\ncrystallized. It is therefore probable that the whole planet once\r\nconsisted of these mysterious and curiously bedded formations at a time\r\nwhen the volcanic fire had not yet been brought into activity. Since\r\nthat period there seems to have been a gradual development of heat; and\r\nthis augmentation we may expect to continue till the whole globe shall\r\nbe in a state of fluidity and incandescence.\"\r\n\r\nSuch might be the system of the Gnome at the very time that the\r\nfollowers of Leibnitz, reasoning on what they saw on the outer surface,\r\nmight be teaching the opposite doctrine of gradual refrigeration, and\r\naverring that the earth had begun its career as a fiery comet, and might\r\nbe destined hereafter to become a frozen mass. The tenets of the schools\r\nof the nether and of the upper world would be directly opposed to each\r\nother, for both would partake of the prejudices inevitably resulting\r\nfrom the continual contemplation of one class of phenomena to the\r\nexclusion of another. Man observes the annual decomposition of\r\ncrystalline and igneous rocks, and may sometimes see their conversion\r\ninto stratified deposits; but he cannot witness the reconversion of the\r\nsedimentary into the crystalline by subterranean fire. He is in the\r\nhabit of regarding all the sedimentary rocks as more recent than the\r\nunstratified, for the same reason that we may suppose him to fall into\r\nthe opposite error if he saw the origin of the igneous class only.\r\n\r\nIt was not an impossible contingency, that astronomers might have been\r\nplaced at some period in a situation much resembling that in which the\r\ngeologist seems to stand at present. If the Italians, for example, in\r\nthe early part of the twelfth century, had discovered at Amalfi, instead\r\nof the pandects of Justinian, some ancient manuscripts filled with\r\nastronomical observations relating to a period of three thousand years,\r\nand made by some ancient geometers who possessed optical instruments as\r\nperfect as any in modern Europe, they would probably, on consulting\r\nthese memorials, have come to a conclusion that there had been a great\r\nrevolution in the solar and sidereal systems. \"Many primary and\r\nsecondary planets,\" they might say, \"are enumerated in these tables,\r\nwhich exist no longer. Their positions are assigned with such precision\r\nthat we may assure ourselves that there is nothing in their place at\r\npresent but the blue ether. Where one star is visible to us, these\r\ndocuments represent several thousands. Some of those which are now\r\nsingle consisted then of two separate bodies, often distinguished by\r\ndifferent colors, and revolving periodically round a common centre of\r\ngravity. There is nothing analogous to them in the universe at present;\r\nfor they were neither fixed stars nor planets, but seem to have stood in\r\nthe mutual relation of sun and planet to each other. We must conclude,\r\ntherefore, that there has occurred, at no distant period, a tremendous\r\ncatastrophe, whereby thousands of worlds have been annihilated at once,\r\nand some heavenly bodies absorbed into the substance of others.\"\r\n\r\nWhen such doctrines had prevailed for ages, the discovery of some of the\r\nworlds, supposed to have been lost (the satellites of Jupiter, for\r\nexample), by aid of the first rude telescope invented after the revival\r\nof science, would not dissipate the delusion, for the whole burden of\r\nproof would now be thrown on those who insisted on the stability of the\r\nsystem from a remote period, and these philosophers would be required to\r\ndemonstrate the existence of _all_ the worlds said to have been\r\nannihilated.\r\n\r\nSuch popular prejudices would be most unfavorable to the advancement of\r\nastronomy; for, instead of persevering in the attempt to improve their\r\ninstruments, and laboriously to make and record observations, the\r\ngreater number would despair of verifying the continued existence of the\r\nheavenly bodies not visible to the naked eye. Instead of confessing the\r\nextent of their ignorance, and striving to remove it by bringing to\r\nlight new facts, they would indulge in the more easy and indolent\r\nemployment of framing imaginary theories concerning catastrophes and\r\nmighty revolutions in the system of the universe.\r\n\r\nFor more than two centuries the shelly strata of the Subapennine hills\r\nafforded matter of speculation to the early geologists of Italy, and few\r\nof them had any suspicion that similar deposits were then forming in the\r\nneighboring sea. They were as unconscious of the continued action of\r\ncauses still producing similar effects, as the astronomers, in the case\r\nabove supposed, of the existence of certain heavenly bodies still giving\r\nand reflecting light, and performing their movements as of old. Some\r\nimagined that the strata, so rich in organic remains, instead of being\r\ndue to secondary agents, had been so created in the beginning of things\r\nby the fiat of the Almighty. Others, as we have seen, ascribed the\r\nimbedded fossil bodies to some plastic power which resided in the earth\r\nin the early ages of the world. In what manner were these dogmas at\r\nlength exploded? The fossil relics were carefully compared with their\r\nliving analogues, and all doubts as to their organic origin were\r\neventually dispelled. So, also, in regard to the nature of the\r\ncontaining beds of mud, sand, and limestone: those parts of the bottom\r\nof the sea were examined where shells are now becoming annually entombed\r\nin new deposits. Donati explored the bed of the Adriatic, and found the\r\nclosest resemblance between the strata there forming, and those which\r\nconstituted hills above a thousand feet high in various parts of the\r\nItalian peninsula. He ascertained by dredging that living testacea were\r\nthere grouped together in precisely the same manner as were their fossil\r\nanalogues in the inland strata; and while some of the recent shells of\r\nthe Adriatic were becoming incrusted with calcareous rock, he observed\r\nthat others had been newly buried in sand and clay, precisely as fossil\r\nshells occur in the Subapennine hills. This discovery of the identity of\r\nmodern and ancient submarine operations was not made without the aid of\r\nartificial instruments, which, like the telescope, brought phenomena\r\ninto view not otherwise within the sphere of human observation.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the volcanic rocks of the Vicentin had been studied in\r\nthe beginning of the last century; but no geologist suspected, before\r\nthe time of Arduino, that these were composed of ancient submarine\r\nlavas. During many years of controversy, the popular opinion inclined to\r\na belief that basalt and rocks of the same class had been precipitated\r\nfrom a chaotic fluid, or an ocean which rose at successive periods over\r\nthe continents, charged with the component elements of the rocks in\r\nquestion. Few will now dispute that it would have been difficult to\r\ninvent a theory more distant from the truth; yet we must cease to wonder\r\nthat it gained so many proselytes, when we remember that its claims to\r\nprobability arose partly from the very circumstance of its confirming\r\nthe assumed want of analogy between geological causes and those now in\r\naction. By what train of investigations were geologists induced at\r\nlength to reject these views, and to assent to the igneous origin of the\r\ntrappean formations? By an examination of volcanoes now active, and by\r\ncomparing their structure and the composition of their lavas with the\r\nancient trap-rocks.\r\n\r\nThe establishment, from time to time, of numerous points of\r\nidentification, drew at length from geologists a reluctant admission,\r\nthat there was more correspondence between the condition of the globe at\r\nremote eras and now, and more uniformity in the laws which have\r\nregulated the changes of its surface, than they at first imagined. If,\r\nin this state of the science, they still despaired of reconciling every\r\nclass of geological phenomena to the operations of ordinary causes, even\r\nby straining analogy to the utmost limits of credibility, we might have\r\nexpected, at least, that the balance of probability would now have been\r\npresumed to incline towards the close analogy of the ancient and modern\r\ncauses. But, after repeated experience of the failure of attempts to\r\nspeculate on geological monuments, as belonging to a distinct order of\r\nthings, new sects continued to persevere in the principles adopted by\r\ntheir predecessors. They still began, as each new problem presented\r\nitself, whether relating to the animate or inanimate world, to assume an\r\noriginal and dissimilar order of nature; and when at length they\r\napproximated, or entirely came round to an opposite opinion, it was\r\nalways with the feeling, that they were conceding what they had been\r\njustified _a priori_ in deeming improbable. In a word, the same men who,\r\nas natural philosophers, would have been most incredulous respecting any\r\nextraordinary deviations from the known course of nature, if reported to\r\nhave happened _in their own time_, were equally disposed, as geologists,\r\nto expect the proofs of such deviations at every period of the past.\r\n\r\nI shall proceed in the following chapters to enumerate some of the\r\nprincipal difficulties still opposed to the theory of the uniform nature\r\nand energy of the causes which have worked successive changes in the\r\ncrust of the earth, and in the condition of its living inhabitants. The\r\ndiscussion of so important a question on the present occasion may appear\r\npremature, but it is one which naturally arises out of a review of the\r\nformer history of the science. It is, of course, impossible to enter\r\ninto such speculative topics, without occasionally carrying the novice\r\nbeyond his depth, and appealing to facts and conclusions with which he\r\nwill be unacquainted, until he has studied some elementary work on\r\ngeology, but it may be useful to excite his curiosity, and lead him to\r\nstudy such works by calling his attention at once to some of the\r\nprincipal points of controversy.[125]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDOCTRINE OF THE DISCORDANCE OF THE ANCIENT AND MODERN CAUSES OF CHANGE\r\nCONTROVERTED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Climate of the Northern Hemisphere formerly different--Direct proofs\r\n    from the organic remains of the Italian strata--Proofs from analogy\r\n    derived from extinct quadrupeds--Imbedding of animals in\r\n    icebergs--Siberian mammoths--Evidence in regard to temperature, from\r\n    the fossils of tertiary and secondary rocks--From the plants of the\r\n    coal formation--Northern limit of these fossils--Whether such plants\r\n    could endure the long continuance of an arctic night.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Climate of the Northern hemisphere formerly different._--Proofs of\r\nformer revolutions in climate, as deduced from fossil remains, have\r\nafforded one of the most popular objections to the theory which\r\nendeavors to explain all geological changes by reference to those now in\r\nprogress on the earth. The probable causes, therefore, of fluctuations\r\nin climate, may first be treated of.\r\n\r\nThat the climate of the Northern hemisphere has undergone an important\r\nchange, and that its mean annual temperature must once have more nearly\r\nresembled that now experienced within the tropics, was the opinion of\r\nsome of the first naturalists who investigated the contents of the\r\nancient strata. Their conjecture became more probable when the shells\r\nand corals of the older tertiary and many secondary rocks were carefully\r\nexamined; for the organic remains of these formations were found to be\r\nintimately connected by generic affinity with species now living in\r\nwarmer latitudes. At a later period, many reptiles, such as turtles,\r\ntortoises, and large saurian animals, were discovered in European\r\nformations in great abundance; and they supplied new and powerful\r\narguments, from analogy, in support of the doctrine, that the heat of\r\nthe climate had been great when our secondary strata were deposited.\r\nLastly, when the botanist turned his attention to the specific\r\ndetermination of fossil plants, the evidence acquired still fuller\r\nconfirmation; for the flora of a country is peculiarly influenced by\r\ntemperature: and the ancient vegetation of the earth might have been\r\nexpected more readily than the forms of animals, to have afforded\r\nconflicting proofs, had the popular theory been without foundation. When\r\nthe examination of fossil remains was extended to rocks in the most\r\nnorthern parts of Europe and North America, and even to the Arctic\r\nregions, indications of the same revolution in climate were discovered.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said, that in this, as in many other departments of\r\ngeology, we have investigated the phenomena of former eras, and\r\nneglected those of the present state of things. On the contrary, since\r\nthe first agitation of this interesting question, the accessions to our\r\nknowledge of living animals and plants have been immense, and have far\r\nsurpassed all the data previously obtained for generalizing on the\r\nrelation of certain types of organization to particular climates. The\r\ntropical and temperate zones of South America and of Australia have been\r\nexplored; and, on close comparison, it has been found that scarcely any\r\nof the species of the animate creation in these extensive continents are\r\nidentical with those inhabiting the old world. Yet the zoologist and\r\nbotanist, well acquainted with the geographical distribution of organic\r\nbeings in other parts of the globe, would have been able, if distinct\r\ngroups of species had been presented to them from these regions, to\r\nrecognize those which had been collected from latitudes within, and\r\nthose which were brought from without the tropics.\r\n\r\nBefore I attempt to explain the probable causes of great vicissitudes of\r\ntemperature on the earth's surface, I shall take a rapid view of some of\r\nthe principal data which appear to support the popular opinions now\r\nentertained on the subject. To insist on the soundness of these\r\ninferences, is the more necessary, because some zoologists have\r\nundertaken to vindicate the uniformity of the laws of nature, not by\r\naccounting for former fluctuations in climate, but by denying the value\r\nof the evidence in their favor.[126]\r\n\r\n_Proofs from fossil shells in tertiary strata._--In Sicily, Calabria,\r\nand in the neighborhood of Naples, the fossil testacea of the most\r\nmodern tertiary formations belong almost entirely to species now\r\ninhabiting the Mediterranean; but as we proceed northwards in the\r\nItalian peninsula we find in the strata called Subapennine an assemblage\r\nof fossil shells departing somewhat more widely from the type of the\r\nneighboring seas. The proportion of species identifiable with those now\r\nliving in the Mediterranean is still considerable; but it no longer\r\npredominates, as in the South of Italy and part of Sicily, over the\r\nunknown species. Although occurring in localities which are removed\r\nseveral degrees farther from the equator (as at Sienna, Parma, Asti,\r\n&c.), the shells yield clear indications of a warmer climate. This\r\nevidence is of great weight, and is not neutralized by any facts of a\r\nconflicting character; such, for instance, as the association, in the\r\nsame group, of individuals referable to species now confined to arctic\r\nregions. Whenever any of the fossil shells are identified with living\r\nspecies foreign to the Mediterranean, it is not in the Northern Ocean,\r\nbut nearer the tropics, that they must be sought: on the other hand, the\r\nassociated unknown species belong, for the most part, to _genera_ which\r\nare now most largely developed in equinoctial regions, as, for example,\r\nthe genera Cancellaria, Cassidaria, Pleurotoma, Conus, and Cypraea.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the fossils of the tertiary deposits of Paris and London\r\nwith those of Bourdeaux, and these again with the more modern strata of\r\nSicily, we should at first expect that they would each indicate a higher\r\ntemperature in proportion as they are situated farther to the south.\r\nBut the contrary is true; of the shells belonging to these several\r\ngroups, whether freshwater or marine, some are of extinct, others of\r\nliving species. Those found in the older, or Eocene, deposits of Paris\r\nand London, although six or seven degrees to the north of the Miocene\r\nstrata at Bourdeaux, afford evidence of a warmer climate; while those of\r\nBourdeaux imply that the sea in which they lived was of a higher\r\ntemperature than that of Sicily, where the shelly strata were formed six\r\nor seven degrees nearer to the equator. In these cases the greater\r\nantiquity of the several formations (the Parisian being the oldest and\r\nthe Sicilian the newest) has more than counterbalanced the influence\r\nwhich latitude would otherwise exert, and this phenomenon clearly points\r\nto a gradual and successive refrigeration of climate.\r\n\r\n_Siberian Mammoths._--It will naturally be asked, whether some recent\r\ngeological discoveries bringing evidence to light of a colder, or as it\r\nhas been termed \"glacial epoch,\" towards the close of the tertiary\r\nperiods throughout the northern hemisphere, does not conflict with the\r\ntheory above alluded to, of a warmer temperature having prevailed in the\r\neras of the Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene formations. In answer to this\r\ninquiry, it may certainly be affirmed, that an oscillation of climate\r\nhas occurred in times immediately antecedent to the peopling of the\r\nearth by man; but proof of the intercalation of a less genial climate at\r\nan era when nearly all the marine and terrestrial testacea had already\r\nbecome specifically the same as those now living, by no means rebuts the\r\nconclusion previously drawn, in favor of a warmer condition of the\r\nglobe, during the ages which elapsed while the tertiary strata were\r\ndeposited. In some of the most superficial patches of sand, gravel, and\r\nloam, scattered very generally over Europe, and containing recent\r\nshells, the remains of extinct species of land quadrupeds have been\r\nfound, especially in places where the alluvial matter appears to have\r\nbeen washed into small lakes, or into depressions in the plains\r\nbordering ancient rivers. Similar deposits have also been lodged in\r\nrents and caverns of rocks, where they may have been swept in by land\r\nfloods, or introduced by engulphed rivers during changes in the physical\r\ngeography of these countries. The various circumstances under which the\r\nbones of animals have been thus preserved, will be more fully considered\r\nhereafter;[127] I shall only state here, that among the extinct mammalia\r\nthus entombed, we find species of the elephant, rhinoceros,\r\nhippopotamus, bear, hyaena, lion, tiger, monkey (macacus[128]), and many\r\nothers; consisting partly of genera now confined to warmer regions.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly probable that when some of these quadrupeds abounded in\r\nEurope, the climate was milder than that now experienced. The\r\nhippopotamus, for example, is now only met with where the temperature of\r\nthe water is warm and nearly uniform throughout the year, and where the\r\nrivers are never frozen over. Yet when the great fossil species\r\n(_Hippopotamus major_, Cuv.) inhabited England, the testacea of our\r\ncountry were nearly the same as those now existing, and the climate\r\ncannot be supposed to have been very hot. The bones of this animal have\r\nlately been found by Mr. Strickland, together with those of a bear and\r\nother mammalia, at Cropthorn, near Evesham, in Worcestershire, in\r\nalluvial sand, together with twenty-three species of terrestrial and\r\nfreshwater shells, all, with two exceptions, of British species. The bed\r\nof sand, containing the shells and bones, reposes on lias, and is\r\ncovered with alternating strata of gravel, sand, and loam.[129]\r\n\r\nThe mammoth also appears to have existed in England when the temperature\r\nof our latitudes could not have been very different from that which now\r\nprevails; for remains of this animal have been found at North Cliff, in\r\nthe county of York, in a lacustrine formation, in which all the land and\r\nfreshwater shells, thirteen in number, can be identified with species\r\nand varieties now existing in that county. Bones of the bison, also, an\r\nanimal now inhabiting a cold or temperate climate, have been found in\r\nthe same place. That these quadrupeds, and the indigenous species of\r\ntestacea associated with them, were all contemporary inhabitants of\r\nYorkshire, has been established by unequivocal proof. The Rev. W. V.\r\nVernon Harcourt caused a pit to be sunk to the depth of twenty-two feet\r\nthrough undisturbed strata, in which the remains of the mammoth were\r\nfound imbedded, together with the shells, in a deposit which had\r\nevidently resulted from tranquil waters.[130]\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the Thames, as at Ilford and Grays, in Essex, bones of\r\nthe elephant and rhinoceros occur in strata abounding in freshwater\r\nshells of the genera Unio, Cyclas, Paludina, Valvata, Ancylus, and\r\nothers. These fossil shells belong for the most part to species now\r\nliving in the same district, yet some few of them are extinct, as, for\r\nexample, a species of Cyrena, a genus no longer inhabiting Europe, and\r\nnow entirely restricted to warmer latitudes.\r\n\r\nWhen reasoning on such phenomena, the reader must always bear in mind\r\nthat the fossil individuals belonged to _species_ of elephant,\r\nrhinoceros, hippopotamus, bear, tiger, and hyaena, distinct from those\r\nwhich now dwell within or near the tropics. Dr. Fleming, in a discussion\r\non this subject, has well remarked that a near resemblance in form and\r\nosteological structure is not always followed, in the existing creation,\r\nby a similarity of geographical distribution; and we must therefore be\r\non our guard against deciding too confidently, from mere analogy of\r\nanatomical structure, respecting the habits and physiological\r\npeculiarities of _species_ now no more. \"The zebra delights to roam over\r\nthe tropical plains, while the horse can maintain its existence\r\nthroughout an Iceland winter. The buffalo, like the zebra, prefers a\r\nhigh temperature, and cannot thrive even where the common ox prospers.\r\nThe musk-ox, on the other hand, though nearly resembling the buffalo,\r\nprefers the stinted herbage of the arctic regions, and is able, by its\r\nperiodical migrations, to outlive a northern winter. The jackal (_Canis\r\naureus_) inhabits Africa, the warmer parts of Asia, and Greece; while\r\nthe isatis (_Canis lagopus_) resides in the arctic regions. The African\r\nhare and the polar hare have their geographical distribution expressed\r\nin their trivial names;\"[131] and different species of bears thrive in\r\ntropical, temperate, and arctic latitudes.\r\n\r\nRecent investigations have placed beyond all doubt the important fact\r\nthat a species of tiger, identical with that of Bengal, is common in the\r\nneighborhood of Lake Aral, near Sussac, in the forty-fifth degree of\r\nnorth latitude; and from time to time this animal is now seen in\r\nSiberia, in a latitude as far north as the parallel of Berlin and\r\nHamburgh.[132] Humboldt remarks that the part of Southern Asia now\r\ninhabited by this Indian species of tiger is separated from the Himalaya\r\nby two great chains of mountains, each covered with perpetual snow,--the\r\nchain of Kuenlun, lat. 35 degrees N., and that of Mouztagh, lat. 42\r\ndegrees,--so that it is impossible that these animals should merely have\r\nmade excursions from India, so as to have penetrated in summer to the\r\nforty-eighth and fifty-third degrees of north latitude. They must remain\r\nall the winter north of the Mouztagh, or Celestial Mountains. The last\r\ntiger killed, in 1828, on the Lena, in lat. 52-1/4 degrees, was in a\r\nclimate colder than that of Petersburg and Stockholm.[133]\r\n\r\nWe learn from Mr. Hodgson's account of the mammalia of Nepal, that the\r\ntiger is sometimes found at the very edge of perpetual snow in the\r\nHimalaya;[134] and Pennant mentions that it is found among the snows of\r\nMount Ararat in Armenia. The jaguar, also, has been seen in America,\r\nwandering from Mexico, as far north as Kentucky, lat. 37 degrees\r\nN.,[135] and even as far as 42 degrees S. in South America,--a latitude\r\nwhich corresponds to that of the Pyrenees in the northern\r\nhemisphere.[136] The range of the puma is still wider, for it roams from\r\nthe equator to the Straits of Magellan, being often seen at Port Famine,\r\nin lat. 53 degrees 38 minutes S.\r\n\r\nA new species of panther (_Felis irbis_), covered with long hair, has\r\nbeen discovered in Siberia, evidently inhabiting, like the tiger, a\r\nregion north of the Celestial Mountains, which are in lat. 42\r\ndegrees.[137]\r\n\r\nThe two-horned African rhinoceros occurs without the tropics at the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, in lat. 34 degrees 29 minutes S., where it is accompanied\r\nby the elephant, hippopotamus, and hyaena. Here the migration of all\r\nthese species towards the south is arrested by the ocean; but if the\r\ncontinent had been prolonged still farther, and the land had been of\r\nmoderate elevation, it is very probable that they might have extended\r\ntheir range to a greater distance from the tropics.\r\n\r\nNow, if the Indian tiger can range in our own times to the southern\r\nborders of Siberia, or skirt the snows of the Himalaya, and if the puma\r\ncan reach the fifty-third degree of latitude in South America, we may\r\neasily understand how large species of the same _genera_ may once have\r\ninhabited our temperate climates. The mammoth (_E. primigenius_),\r\nalready alluded to, as occurring fossil in England, was decidedly\r\ndifferent from the two existing species of elephants, one of which is\r\nlimited to Asia, south of the 31 degrees of N. lat., the other to\r\nAfrica, where it extends, as before stated, as far south as the Cape of\r\nGood Hope. The bones of the great fossil species are very widely spread\r\nover Europe and North America; but are nowhere in such profusion as in\r\nSiberia, particularly near the shores of the Frozen Ocean. Are we, then,\r\nto conclude that this animal preferred a polar climate? If so, it may\r\nwell be asked, by what food was it sustained, and why does it not still\r\nsurvive near the arctic circle?[138]\r\n\r\nPallas and other writers describe the bones of the mammoth as abounding\r\nthroughout all the Lowlands of Siberia, stretching in a direction west\r\nand east, from the borders of Europe to the extreme point nearest\r\nAmerica, and south and north, from the base of the mountains of Central\r\nAsia to the shores of the Arctic Sea. (See map, fig. 1.) Within this\r\nspace, scarcely inferior in area to the whole of Europe, fossil ivory\r\nhas been collected almost everywhere, on the banks of the Irtish, Obi,\r\nYenesei, Lena, and other rivers. The elephantine remains do not occur in\r\nthe marshes and low plains, but where the banks of the rivers present\r\nlofty precipices of sand and clay, from which circumstance Pallas very\r\njustly inferred that, if sections could be obtained, similar bones might\r\nbe found in all the elevated lands intervening between the great rivers.\r\nStrahlenberg, indeed, had stated, before the time of Pallas, that\r\nwherever any of the great rivers overflowed and cut out fresh channels\r\nduring floods, more fossil remains of the same kind were invariably\r\ndisclosed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF SIBERIA.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.\r\n\r\n_Map showing the course of the Siberian rivers from south to north, from\r\ntemperate to arctic regions, in the country where the fossil bones of\r\nthe Mammoth abound._]\r\n\r\nAs to the position of the bones, Pallas found them in some places\r\nimbedded together with marine remains; in others, simply with fossil\r\nwood, or lignite, such as, he says, might have been derived from\r\ncarbonized peat. On the banks of the Yenesei, below the city of\r\nKrasnojarsk, in lat. 56 degrees, he observed grinders, and bones of\r\nelephants, in strata of yellow and red loam, alternating with coarse\r\nsand and gravel, in which was also much petrified wood of the willow and\r\nother trees. Neither here nor in the neighboring country were there any\r\nmarine shells, but merely layers of black coal.[139] But grinders of the\r\nmammoth were collected much farther down the same river, near the sea,\r\nin lat. 70 degrees, mixed with _marine_ petrifactions.[140] Many other\r\nplaces in Siberia are cited by Pallas, where sea shells and fishes'\r\nteeth accompany the bones of the mammoth, rhinoceros, and Siberian\r\nbuffalo, or bison (_Bos priscus_). But it is not on the Obi nor the\r\nYenesei, but on the Lena, farther to the east, where, in the same\r\nparallels of latitude, the cold is far more intense, that fossil remains\r\nhave been found in the most wonderful state of preservation. In 1772,\r\nPallas obtained from Wiljuiskoi, in lat. 64 degrees, from the banks of\r\nthe Wiljui, a tributary of the Lena, the carcass of a rhinoceros (_R.\r\ntichorhinus_), taken from the sand in which it must have remained\r\ncongealed for ages, the soil of that region being always frozen to\r\nwithin a slight depth of the surface. This carcass was compared to a\r\nnatural mummy, and emitted an odor like putrid flesh, part of the skin\r\nbeing still covered with black and gray hairs. So great, indeed, was the\r\nquantity of hair on the foot and head conveyed to St. Petersburg, that\r\nPallas asked whether the rhinoceros of the Lena might not have been an\r\ninhabitant of the temperate regions of middle Asia, its clothing being\r\nso much warmer than that of the African rhinoceros.[141]\r\n\r\nProfessor Brandt, of St. Petersburg, in a letter to Baron Alex. Von\r\nHumboldt, dated 1846, adds the following particulars respecting this\r\nwonderful fossil relic:--\"I have been so fortunate as to extract from\r\ncavities in the molar teeth of the Wiljui rhinoceros a small quantity of\r\nits half-chewed food, among which fragments of pine leaves, one-half of\r\nthe seed of a polygonaceous plant, and very minute portions of wood with\r\nporous cells (or small fragments of coniferous wood), were still\r\nrecognizable. It was also remarkable, on a close investigation of the\r\nhead, that the blood-vessels discovered in the interior of the mass\r\nappeared filled, even to the capillary vessels, with a brown mass\r\n(coagulated blood), which in many places still showed the red color of\r\nblood.\"[142]\r\n\r\nAfter more than thirty years, the entire carcass of a mammoth (or\r\nextinct species of elephant) was obtained in 1803, by Mr. Adams, much\r\nfarther to the north. It fell from a mass of ice, in which it had been\r\nencased, on the banks of the Lena, in lat. 70 degrees; and so perfectly\r\nhad the soft parts of the carcass been preserved, that the flesh, as it\r\nlay, was devoured by wolves and bears. This skeleton is still in the\r\nmuseum of St. Petersburg, the head retaining its integument and many of\r\nthe ligaments entire. The skin of the animal was covered, first, with\r\nblack bristles, thicker than horse hair, from twelve to sixteen inches\r\nin length; secondly, with hair of a reddish brown color, about four\r\ninches long; and thirdly, with wool of the same color as the hair, about\r\nan inch in length. Of the fur, upwards of thirty pounds' weight were\r\ngathered from the wet sand-bank. The individual was nine feet high and\r\nsixteen feet long, without reckoning the large curved tusks: a size\r\nrarely surpassed by the largest living male elephants.[143]\r\n\r\nIt is evident, then, that the mammoth, instead of being naked, like the\r\nliving Indian and African elephants, was enveloped in a thick shaggy\r\ncovering of fur, probably as impenetrable to rain and cold as that of\r\nthe musk ox.[144] The species may have been fitted by nature to\r\nwithstand the vicissitudes of a northern climate; and it is certain\r\nthat, from the moment when the carcasses, both of the rhinoceros and\r\nelephant, above described, were buried in Siberia, in latitudes 64\r\ndegrees and 70 degrees N., the soil must have remained frozen, and the\r\natmosphere nearly as cold as at this day.\r\n\r\nThe most recent discoveries made in 1843 by Mr. Middendorf, a\r\ndistinguished Russian naturalist, and which he communicated to me in\r\nSeptember, 1846, afford more precise information as to the climate of\r\nthe Siberian lowlands, at the period when the extinct quadrupeds were\r\nentombed. One elephant was found on the Tas, between the Obi and\r\nYenesei, near the arctic circle, about lat. 66 degrees 30 minutes N.,\r\nwith some parts of the flesh in so perfect a state that the bulb of the\r\neye is now preserved in the museum at Moscow. Another carcass, together\r\nwith a young individual of the same species, was met with in the same\r\nyear, 1843, in lat. 75 degrees 15 minutes N., near the river Taimyr,\r\nwith the flesh decayed. It was imbedded in strata of clay and sand, with\r\nerratic blocks, at about 15 feet above the level of the sea. In the same\r\ndeposit Mr. Middendorf observed the trunk of a larch tree (_Pinus\r\nlarix_), the same wood as that now carried down in abundance by the\r\nTaimyr to the Arctic Sea. There were also associated fossil shells of\r\n_living northern_ species, and which are moreover characteristic of the\r\ndrift or _glacial_ deposits of Europe. Among these _Nucula pygmaea_,\r\n_Tellina calcarea_, _Mya truncata_, and _Saxicava rugosa_ were\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\nSo fresh is the ivory throughout northern Russia, that, according to\r\nTilesius, thousands of fossil tusks have been collected and used in\r\nturning; yet others are still procured and sold in great plenty. He\r\ndeclares his belief that the bones still left in northern Russia must\r\ngreatly exceed in number all the elephants now living on the globe.\r\n\r\nWe are as yet ignorant of the entire geographical range of the mammoth;\r\nbut its remains have been recently collected from the cliffs of frozen\r\nmud and ice on the east side of Behring's Straits, in Eschscholtz's Bay,\r\nin Russian America, lat. 66 degrees N. As the cliffs waste away by the\r\nthawing of the ice, tusks and bones fall out, and a strong odor of\r\nanimal matter is exhaled from the mud.[145]\r\n\r\nOn considering all the facts above enumerated, it seems reasonable to\r\nimagine that a large region in central Asia, including, perhaps, the\r\nsouthern half of Siberia, enjoyed, at no very remote period in the\r\nearth's history, a temperate climate, sufficiently mild to afford food\r\nfor numerous herds of elephants and rhinoceroses, _of species distinct\r\nfrom those now living_. It has usually been taken for granted that\r\nherbivorous animals of large size require a very luxuriant vegetation\r\nfor their support; but this opinion is, according to Mr. Darwin,\r\ncompletely erroneous:--\"It has been derived,\" he says, \"from our\r\nacquaintance with India and the Indian islands, where the mind has been\r\naccustomed to associate troops of elephants with noble forests and\r\nimpenetrable jungles. But the southern parts of Africa, from the tropic\r\nof Capricorn to the Cape of Good Hope, although sterile and desert, are\r\nremarkable for the number and great bulk of the indigenous quadrupeds.\r\nWe there meet with an elephant, five species of rhinoceros, a\r\nhippopotamus, a giraffe, the bos caffer, the elan, two zebras, the\r\nquagga, two gnus, and several antelopes. Nor must we suppose, that while\r\nthe species are numerous, the individuals of each kind are few. Dr.\r\nAndrew Smith saw, in one day's march, in lat. 24 degrees S., without\r\nwandering to any great distance on either side, about 150 rhinoceroses,\r\nwith several herds of giraffes, and his party had killed, on the\r\nprevious night, eight hippopotamuses. Yet the country which they\r\ninhabited was thinly covered with grass and bushes about four feet high,\r\nand still more thinly with mimosa-trees, so that the wagons of the\r\ntravellers were not prevented from proceeding in a nearly direct\r\nline.\"[146]\r\n\r\nIn order to explain how so many animals can find support in this region,\r\nit is suggested that the underwood, of which their food chiefly\r\nconsists, may contain much nutriment in a small bulk, and also that the\r\nvegetation has a rapid growth; for no sooner is a part consumed than its\r\nplace, says Dr. Smith, is supplied by a fresh stock. Nevertheless, after\r\nmaking every allowance for this successive production and consumption,\r\nit is clear, from the facts above cited, that the quantity of food\r\nrequired by the larger herbivora is much less than we have usually\r\nimagined. Mr. Darwin conceives that the amount of vegetation supported\r\nat any one time by Great Britain may exceed, in a ten-fold ratio, the\r\nquantity existing on an equal area in the interior parts of Southern\r\nAfrica.[147] It is remarked, moreover, in illustration of the small\r\nconnection discoverable between abundance of food and the magnitude of\r\nindigenous mammalia, that while in the desert part of Southern Africa\r\nthere are so many huge animals; in Brazil, where the splendor and\r\nexuberance of the vegetation are unrivalled, there is not a single wild\r\nquadruped of large size.[148]\r\n\r\nIt would doubtless be impossible for herds of mammoths and rhinoceroses\r\nto subsist, at present, throughout the year, even in the southern part\r\nof Siberia, covered as it is with snow during winter; but there is no\r\ndifficulty in supposing a vegetation capable of nourishing these great\r\nquadrupeds to have once flourished between the latitudes 40 degrees and\r\n60 degrees N.\r\n\r\nDr. Fleming has hinted, that \"the kind of food which the existing\r\nspecies of elephant prefers, will not enable us to determine, or even to\r\noffer a probable conjecture, concerning that of the extinct species. No\r\none acquainted with the gramineous character of the food of our\r\nfallow-deer, stag, or roe, would have assigned a lichen to the\r\nreindeer.\"\r\n\r\nTravellers mention that, even now, when the climate of eastern Asia is\r\nso much colder than the same parallels of latitude farther west, there\r\nare woods not only of fir, but of birch, poplar, and alder, on the banks\r\nof the Lena, as far north as latitude 60 degrees.\r\n\r\nIt has, moreover, been suggested, that as, in our own times, the\r\nnorthern animals migrate, so the Siberian elephant and rhinoceros may\r\nhave wandered towards the north in summer. The musk oxen annually desert\r\ntheir winter quarters in the south, and cross the sea upon the ice, to\r\ngraze for four months, from May to September, on the rich pasturage of\r\nMelville Island, in lat. 75 degrees. The mammoths, without passing so far\r\nbeyond the arctic circle, may nevertheless have made excursions, during\r\nthe heat of a brief northern summer, from the central or temperate parts\r\nof Asia to the sixtieth parallel of latitude.\r\n\r\nNow, in this case, the preservation of their bones, or even occasionally\r\nof their entire carcasses, in ice or frozen soil, may be accounted for,\r\nwithout resorting to speculations concerning sudden revolutions in the\r\nformer state and climate of the earth's surface. We are entitled to\r\nassume, that, in the time of the extinct elephant and rhinoceros, the\r\nLowland of Siberia was less extensive towards the north than now; for we\r\nhave seen (p. 80) that the strata of this Lowland, in which the fossil\r\nbones lie buried, were originally deposited beneath the sea; and we\r\nknow, from the facts brought to light in Wrangle's Voyage, in the years\r\n1821, 1822, and 1823, that a slow upheaval of the land along the borders\r\nof the Icy Sea is now constantly taking place, similar to that\r\nexperienced in part of Sweden. In the same manner, then, as the shores\r\nof the Gulf of Bothnia are extended, not only by the influx of sediment\r\nbrought down by rivers, but also by the elevation and consequent drying\r\nup of the bed of the sea, so a like combination of causes may, in modern\r\ntimes, have been extending the low tract of land where marine shells\r\nand fossil bones occur in Siberia.[149] Such a change in the physical\r\ngeography of that region, implying a constant augmentation in the\r\nquantity of arctic land, would, according to principles to be explained\r\nin the next chapter, tend to increase the severity of the winters. We\r\nmay conclude, therefore, that, before the land reached so far to the\r\nnorth, the temperature of the Siberian winter and summer was more nearly\r\nequalized; and a greater degree of winter's cold may, even more than a\r\ngeneral diminution of the mean annual temperature, have finally\r\ncontributed to the extermination of the mammoth and its contemporaries.\r\n\r\nOn referring to the map (p. 79), the reader will see how all the great\r\nrivers of Siberia flow at present from south to north, from temperate to\r\narctic regions, and they are all liable, like the Mackenzie, in North\r\nAmerica, to remarkable floods, in consequence of flowing in this\r\ndirection. For they are filled with running water in their upper or\r\nsouthern course when completely frozen over for several hundred miles\r\nnear their mouths, where they remain blocked up by ice for six months in\r\nevery year. The descending waters, therefore, finding no open channel,\r\nrush over the ice, often changing their direction, and sweeping along\r\nforests and prodigious quantities of soil and gravel mixed with ice. Now\r\nthe rivers of Siberia are among the largest in the world, the Yenesei\r\nhaving a course of 2500, the Lena of 2000 miles; so that we may easily\r\nconceive that the bodies of animals which fall into their waters may be\r\ntransported to vast distances towards the Arctic Sea, and, before\r\narriving there, may be stranded upon and often frozen into thick ice.\r\nAfterwards, when the ice breaks up, they may be floated still farther\r\ntowards the ocean, until at length they become buried in fluviatile and\r\nsubmarine deposits near the mouths of rivers.\r\n\r\nHumboldt remarks that near the mouths of the Lena a considerable\r\nthickness of frozen soil may be found at all seasons at the depth of a\r\nfew feet; so that if a carcass be once imbedded in mud and ice in such a\r\nregion and in such a climate, its putrefaction may be arrested for\r\nindefinite ages.[150] According to Prof. Von Baer of St. Petersburg, the\r\nground is now frozen permanently to the depth of 400 feet, at the town\r\nof Yakutzt, on the western bank of the Lena, in lat. 62 degrees N., 600\r\nmiles distant from the polar sea. Mr. Hedenstrom tells us that,\r\nthroughout a wide area in Siberia, the boundary cliffs of the lakes and\r\nrivers consist of alternate layers of earthy materials and ice, in\r\nhorizontal stratification;[151] and Mr. Middendorf informed us, in 1846,\r\nthat, in his tour there three years before, he had bored in Siberia to\r\nthe depth of seventy feet, and, after passing through much frozen soil\r\nmixed with ice, had come down upon a solid mass of pure transparent ice,\r\nthe thickness of which, after penetrating two or three yards, they did\r\nnot ascertain. We may conceive, therefore, that even at the period of\r\nthe mammoth, when the Lowland of Siberia was less extensive towards the\r\nnorth, and consequently the climate more temperate than now, the cold\r\nmay still have been sufficiently intense to cause the rivers flowing in\r\ntheir present direction to sweep down from south to north the bodies of\r\ndrowned animals, and there bury them in drift ice and frozen mud.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that the carcass of the mammoth was imbedded in pure ice,\r\nthere are two ways in which it may have been frozen in. We may suppose\r\nthe animal to have been overwhelmed by drift snow. I have been informed\r\nby Dr. Richardson, that, in the northern parts of America, comprising\r\nregions now inhabited by many herbivorous quadrupeds, the drift snow is\r\noften converted into permanent glaciers. It is commonly blown over the\r\nedges of steep cliffs, so as to form an inclined talus hundreds of feet\r\nhigh; and when a thaw commences, torrents rush from the land, and throw\r\ndown from the top of the cliff alluvial soil and gravel. This new soil\r\nsoon becomes covered with vegetation, and protects the foundation of\r\nsnow from the rays of the sun. Water occasionally penetrates into the\r\ncrevices and pores of the snow; but, as it soon freezes again, it serves\r\nthe more rapidly to consolidate the mass into a compact iceberg. It may\r\nsometimes happen that cattle grazing in a valley at the base of such\r\ncliffs, on the borders of a sea or river, may be overwhelmed, and at\r\nlength inclosed in solid ice, and then transported towards the polar\r\nregions. Or a herd of mammoths returning from their summer pastures in\r\nthe north, may have been surprised, while crossing a stream, by the\r\nsudden congelation of the waters. The missionary Huc relates, in his\r\ntravels in Thibet in 1846, that, after many of his party had been frozen\r\nto death, they pitched their tents on the banks of the Mouroui-Ousson\r\n(which lower down becomes the famous Blue River), and saw from their\r\nencampment \"some black shapeless objects ranged in file across the\r\nstream. As they advanced nearer no change either in form or distinctness\r\nwas apparent; nor was it till they were quite close, that they\r\nrecognized in them a troop of the wild oxen, called Yak by the\r\nThibetans.[152] There were more than fifty of them incrusted in the ice.\r\nNo doubt they had tried to swim across at the moment of congelation, and\r\nhad been unable to disengage themselves. Their beautiful heads,\r\nsurmounted by huge horns, were still above the surface, but their bodies\r\nwere held fast in the ice, which was so transparent that the position of\r\nthe imprudent beasts was easily distinguishable; they looked as if still\r\nswimming, but the eagles and ravens had pecked out their eyes.\"[153]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing investigations, therefore, lead us to infer that the\r\nmammoth, and some other extinct quadrupeds fitted to live in high\r\nlatitudes, were inhabitants of Northern Asia at a time when the\r\ngeographical conditions and climate of that continent were different\r\nfrom the present. But the age of this fauna was comparatively modern in\r\nthe earth's history. It appears that when the oldest or eocene tertiary\r\ndeposits were formed, a warm temperature pervaded the European seas and\r\nlands. Shells of the genus Nautilus and other forms characteristic of\r\ntropical latitudes; fossil reptiles, such as the crocodile, turtle, and\r\ntortoise; plants, such as palms, some of them allied to the cocoa-nut,\r\nthe screw-pine, the custard-apple, and the acacia, all lead to this\r\nconclusion. This flora and fauna were followed by those of the miocene\r\nformation, in which indications of a southern, but less tropical climate\r\nare detected. Finally, the pliocene deposits, which come next in\r\nsuccession, exhibit in their organic remains a much nearer approach to\r\nthe state of things now prevailing in corresponding latitudes. It was\r\ntowards the close of this period that the seas of the northern\r\nhemisphere became more and more filled with floating icebergs often\r\ncharged with erratic blocks, so that the waters and the atmosphere were\r\nchilled by the melting ice, and an arctic fauna enabled, for a time, to\r\ninvade the temperate latitudes both of N. America and Europe. The\r\nextinction of a considerable number of land quadrupeds and aquatic\r\nmollusca was gradually brought about by the increasing severity of the\r\ncold; but many species survived this revolution in climate, either by\r\ntheir capacity of living under a variety of conditions, or by migrating\r\nfor a time to more southern lands and seas. At length, by modifications\r\nin the physical geography of the northern regions, and the cessation of\r\nfloating ice on the eastern side of the Atlantic, the cold was\r\nmoderated, and a milder climate ensued, such as we now enjoy in\r\nEurope.[154]\r\n\r\n_Proofs from fossils in secondary and still older strata._--A great\r\ninterval of time appears to have elapsed between the formation of the\r\nsecondary strata, which constitute the principal portion of the elevated\r\nland in Europe, and the origin of the eocene deposits. If we examine the\r\nrocks from the chalk to the new red sandstone inclusive, we find many\r\ndistinct assemblages of fossils entombed in them, all of unknown\r\nspecies, and many of them referable to genera and families now most\r\nabundant between the tropics. Among the most remarkable are reptiles of\r\ngigantic size; some of them herbivorous, others carnivorous, and far\r\nexceeding in size any now known even in the torrid zone. The genera are\r\nfor the most part extinct, but some of them, as the crocodile and\r\nmonitor, have still representatives in the warmer parts of the earth.\r\nCoral reefs also were evidently numerous in the seas of the same\r\nperiods, composed of species often belonging to genera now\r\ncharacteristic of a tropical climate. The number of large chambered\r\nshells also, including the nautilus, leads us to infer an elevated\r\ntemperature; and the associated fossil plants, although imperfectly\r\nknown, tend to the same conclusion, the Cycadeae constituting the most\r\nnumerous family.\r\n\r\nBut it is from the more ancient coal-deposits that the most\r\nextraordinary evidence has been supplied in proof of the former\r\nexistence of a very different climate--a climate which seems to have\r\nbeen moist, warm, and extremely uniform, in those very latitudes which\r\nare now the colder, and in regard to temperature, the most variable\r\nregions of the globe. We learn from the researches of Adolphe\r\nBrongniart, Goeppert, and other botanists, that in the flora of the\r\ncarboniferous era there was a great predominance of ferns, some of which\r\nwere arborescent; as, for example, Caulopteris, Protopteris, and\r\nPsarronius; nor can this be accounted for, as some have supposed, by the\r\ngreater power which ferns possess of resisting maceration in water.[155]\r\nThis prevalence of ferns indicates a moist, equable, and temperate\r\nclimate, and the absence of any severe cold; for such are the conditions\r\nwhich, at the present day, are found to be most favorable to that tribe\r\nof plants. It is only in the islands of the tropical oceans, and of the\r\nsouthern temperate zone, such as Norfolk Island, Otaheite, the Sandwich\r\nIslands, Tristan d'Acunha, and New Zealand, that we find any near\r\napproach to that remarkable preponderance of ferns which is\r\ncharacteristic of the Carboniferous flora. It has been observed that\r\ntree ferns and other forms of vegetation which flourished most\r\nluxuriantly within the tropics, extend to a much greater distance from\r\nthe equator in the southern hemisphere than in the northern, being found\r\neven as far as 46 degrees S. latitude in New Zealand. There is little\r\ndoubt that this is owing to the more uniform and moist climate\r\noccasioned by the greater proportional area of sea. Next to ferns and\r\npines, the most abundant vegetable forms in the coal formation are the\r\nCalamites, Lepidodendra, Sigillariae, and Stigmariae. These were\r\nformerly considered to be so closely allied to tropical genera, and to\r\nbe so much greater in size than the corresponding tribes now inhabiting\r\nequatorial latitudes, that they were thought to imply an extremely hot,\r\nas well as humid and equable climate. But recent discoveries respecting\r\nthe structure and relations of these fossil plants, have shown that they\r\ndeviated so widely from all existing types in the vegetable world, that\r\nwe have more reason to infer from this evidence a widely different\r\nclimate in the Carboniferous era, as compared to that now prevailing,\r\nthan a temperature extremely elevated.[156] Palms, if not entirely\r\nwanting when the strata of the carboniferous group were deposited,\r\nappear to have been exceedingly rare.[157] The Coniferae, on the other\r\nhand, so abundantly met with in the coal, resemble Araucariae in\r\nstructure, a family of the fir tribe, characteristic at present of the\r\nmilder regions of the southern hemisphere, such as Chili, Brazil, New\r\nHolland, and Norfolk Island.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to the geographical extent of the ancient vegetation, it was\r\nnot confined,\" says M. Brongniart, \"to a small space, as to Europe, for\r\nexample; for the same forms are met with again at great distances. Thus,\r\nthe coal-plants of North America are, for the most part, identical with\r\nthose of Europe, and all belong to the same genera. Some specimens,\r\nalso, from Greenland, are referable to ferns, analogous to those of our\r\nEuropean coal-mines.\"[158] The fossil plants brought from Melville\r\nIsland, although in a very imperfect state, have been supposed to\r\nwarrant similar conclusions;[159] and assuming that they agree with\r\nthose of Baffin's Bay, mentioned by M. Brongniart, how shall we explain\r\nthe manner in which such a vegetation lived through an arctic night of\r\nseveral months' duration?[160]\r\n\r\nIt may seem premature to discuss this question until the true nature of\r\nthe fossil flora of the arctic regions has been more accurately\r\ndetermined; yet, as the question has attracted some attention, let us\r\nassume for a moment that the coal-plants of Melville Island are strictly\r\nanalogous to those of the strata of Northumberland--would such a fact\r\npresent an inexplicable enigma to the vegetable physiologist?\r\n\r\nPlants, it is affirmed, cannot remain in darkness, even for a week,\r\nwithout serious injury, unless in a torpid state; and if exposed to heat\r\nand moisture they cannot remain torpid, but will grow, and must\r\ntherefore perish. If, then, in the latitude of Melville Island, 75\r\ndegrees N., a high temperature, and consequent humidity, prevailed at\r\nthat period when we know the arctic seas were filled with corals and\r\nlarge multilocular shells, how could plants of tropical forms have\r\nflourished? Is not the bright light of equatorial regions as\r\nindispensable a condition of their well-being as the sultry heat of the\r\nsame countries? and how could they annually endure a night prolonged for\r\nthree months?[161]\r\n\r\nNow, in reply to this objection, we must bear in mind, in the first\r\nplace, that, so far as experiments have been made, there is every reason\r\nto conclude, that the range of intensity of light to which living plants\r\ncan accommodate themselves is far wider than that of heat. No palms or\r\ntree ferns can live in our temperate latitudes without protection from\r\nthe cold; but when placed in hot-houses they grow luxuriantly, even\r\nunder a cloudy sky, and where much light is intercepted by the glass and\r\nframe-work. At St. Petersburg, in lat. 60 degrees N., these plants have\r\nbeen successfully cultivated in hot-houses, although there they must\r\nexchange the perpetual equinox of their native regions, for days and\r\nnights which are alternately protracted to nineteen hours and shortened\r\nto five. How much farther towards the pole they might continue to live,\r\nprovided a due quantity of heat and moisture were supplied, has not yet\r\nbeen determined; but St. Petersburg is probably not the utmost limit,\r\nand we should expect that in lat. 65 degrees at least, where they would\r\nnever remain twenty-four hours without enjoying the sun's light, they\r\nmight still exist.\r\n\r\nIt should also be borne in mind, in regard to tree ferns, that they grow\r\nin the gloomiest and darkest parts of the forests of warm and temperate\r\nregions, even extending to nearly the 46th degree of south latitude in\r\nNew Zealand. In equatorial countries, says Humboldt, they abound chiefly\r\nin the temperate, humid, and shady parts of _mountains_. As we know,\r\ntherefore, that elevation often compensates for the effect of latitude\r\nin the geographical distribution of plants, we may easily understand\r\nthat a class of vegetables, which grows at a certain height in the\r\ntorrid zone, would flourish on the plains at greater distances from the\r\nequator, if the temperature, moisture, and other necessary conditions,\r\nwere equally uniform throughout the year.\r\n\r\nNor must we forget that in all the examples above alluded to, we have\r\nbeen speaking of _living_ species; but the coal-plants were of perfectly\r\ndistinct species, nay, few of them except the ferns and pines can be\r\nreferred to genera or even families of the existing vegetable kingdom.\r\nHaving a structure, therefore, and often a form which appears to the\r\nbotanist so anomalous, they may also have been endowed with a different\r\nconstitution, enabling them to bear a greater variation of circumstances\r\nin regard to light. We find that particular species of plants and tree\r\nferns require at present different degrees of heat; and that some\r\nspecies can thrive only in the immediate neighborhood of the equator,\r\nothers only a distance from it. In the same manner the _minimum of\r\nlight_, sufficient for the now existing species, cannot be taken as the\r\nstandard for all analogous tribes that may ever have flourished on the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nBut granting that the extreme northern point to which a flora like that\r\nof the Carboniferous era could ever reach, may be somewhere between the\r\nlatitudes of 65 degrees and 70 degrees, we should still have to inquire\r\nwhether the vegetable remains might not have been drifted from thence,\r\nby rivers and currents, to the parallel of Melville Island, or still\r\nfarther. In the northern hemisphere, at present, we see that the\r\nmaterials for future beds of lignite and coal are becoming amassed in\r\nhigh latitudes, far from the districts where the forests grew, and on\r\nshores where scarcely a stunted shrub can now exist. The Mackenzie, and\r\nother rivers of North America, carry pines with their roots attached for\r\nmany hundred miles towards the north, into the Arctic Sea, where they\r\nare imbedded in deltas, and some of them drifted still farther by\r\ncurrents towards the pole.\r\n\r\nBefore we can decide on this question of transportation, we must know\r\nwhether the fossil coal-plants occurring in high latitudes bear the\r\nmarks of friction and of having decayed previously to fossilization.\r\nMany appearances in our English coal-fields certainly prove that the\r\nplants were not floated from great distances; for the outline of the\r\nstems of succulent species preserve their sharp angles, and others have\r\ntheir surfaces marked with the most delicate lines and streaks. Long\r\nleaves, also, are attached in many instances to the trunks or\r\nbranches;[162] and leaves, we know, in general, are soon destroyed when\r\nsteeped in water, although ferns will retain their forms after an\r\nimmersion of many months.[163] It seems fair to presume, that most of\r\nthe coal-plants grew upon the same land which supplied materials for the\r\nsandstones and conglomerates of the strata in which they are imbedded.\r\nThe coarseness of the particles of many of these rocks attests that they\r\nwere not borne from very remote localities, and that there was land\r\ntherefore in the vicinity wasting away by the action of moving waters.\r\nThe progress also of modern discovery has led to the very general\r\nadmission of the doctrine that beds of coal have for the most part been\r\nformed of the remains of trees and plants that grew on the spot where\r\nthe coal now exists; the land having been successively submerged, so\r\nthat a covering of mud and sand was deposited upon accumulations of\r\nvegetable mater. That such has been the origin of some coal-seams is\r\nproved by the upright position of fossil trees, both in Europe and\r\nAmerica, in which the roots terminate downwards in beds of coal.[164]\r\n\r\nTo return, therefore, from this digression,--the flora of the coal\r\nappears to indicate a uniform and mild temperature in the air, while the\r\nfossils of the contemporaneous mountain-limestone, comprising abundance\r\nof lamelliferous corals, large chambered cephalopods, and crinoidea,\r\nnaturally lead us to infer a considerable warmth in the waters of the\r\nnorthern sea of the Carboniferous period. So also in regard to strata\r\nolder than the coal, they contain in high northern latitudes mountain\r\nmasses of corals which must have lived and grown on the spot, and large\r\nchambered univalves, such as Orthocerata and Nautilus, all seeming to\r\nindicate, even in regions bordering on the arctic circle, the former\r\nprevalence of a temperature more elevated than that now prevailing.\r\n\r\nThe warmth and humidity of the air, and the uniformity of climate, both\r\nin the different seasons of the year, and in different latitudes,\r\nappears to have been most remarkable when some of the oldest of the\r\nfossiliferous strata were formed. The approximation to a climate similar\r\nto that now enjoyed in these latitudes does not commence till the era of\r\nthe formations termed tertiary; and while the different tertiary rocks\r\nwere deposited in succession, from the eocene to the pliocene, the\r\ntemperature seems to have been lowered, and to have continued to\r\ndiminish even after the appearance upon the earth of a considerable\r\nnumber of the existing species, the cold reaching its maximum of\r\nintensity in European latitudes during the glacial epoch, or the epoch\r\nimmediately antecedent to that in which all the species now contemporary\r\nwith man were in being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nFARTHER EXAMINATION OF THE QUESTION AS TO THE ASSUMED DISCORDANCE OF THE\r\nANCIENT AND MODERN CAUSES OF CHANGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  On the causes of vicissitudes in climate--Remarks on the present\r\n    diffusion of heat over the globe--On the dependence of the mean\r\n    temperature on the relative position of land and sea--Isothermal\r\n    Lines--Currents from equatorial regions--Drifting of\r\n    icebergs--Different temperature of Northern and Southern\r\n    hemispheres--Combination of causes which might produce the extreme\r\n    cold of which the earth's surface is susceptible--Conditions\r\n    necessary for the production of the extreme of heat, and its\r\n    probable effects on organic life.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Causes of Vicissitudes in Climate._[165]--As the proofs enumerated in\r\nthe last chapter indicate that the earth's surface has experienced great\r\nchanges of climate since the deposition of the older sedimentary strata,\r\nwe have next to inquire how such vicissitudes can be reconciled with the\r\nexisting order of nature. The cosmogonist has availed himself of this,\r\nas of every obscure problem in geology, to confirm his views concerning\r\na period when the planet was in a nascent or half-formed state, or when\r\nthe laws of the animate and inanimate world differed essentially from\r\nthose now established; and he has in this, as in many other cases,\r\nsucceeded so far, as to divert attention from that class of facts which,\r\nif fully understood, might probably lead to an explanation of the\r\nphenomena. At first it was imagined that the earth's axis had been for\r\nages perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, so that there was a\r\nperpetual equinox, and uniformity of seasons throughout the year;--that\r\nthe planet enjoyed this \"paradisiacal\" state until the era of the great\r\nflood; but in that catastrophe, whether by the shock of a comet, or some\r\nother convulsion, it lost its equal poise, and hence the obliquity of\r\nits axis, and with that the varied seasons of the temperate zone, and\r\nthe long nights and days of the polar circles.\r\n\r\nWhen the progress of astronomical science had exploded this theory, it\r\nwas assumed, that the earth at its creation was in a state of fluidity,\r\nand red-hot, and that ever since that era, it had been cooling down,\r\ncontracting its dimensions, and acquiring a solid crust,--an hypothesis\r\nhardly less arbitrary, yet more calculated for lasting popularity;\r\nbecause, by referring the mind directly to the beginning of things, it\r\nrequires no support from observation, nor from any ulterior hypothesis.\r\nBut if, instead of forming vague conjectures as to what might have been\r\nthe state of the planet at the era of its creation, we fix our thoughts\r\non the connection at present existing between climate and the\r\ndistribution of land and sea; and then consider what influence former\r\nfluctuations in the physical geography of the earth must have had on\r\nsuperficial temperature, we may perhaps approximate to a true theory. If\r\ndoubts and obscurities still remain, they should be ascribed to our\r\nlimited acquaintance with the laws of Nature, not to revolutions in her\r\neconomy;--they should stimulate us to farther research, not tempt us to\r\nindulge our fancies respecting the imaginary changes of internal\r\ntemperature in an embryo world.\r\n\r\n_Diffusion of Heat over the Globe._--In considering the laws which\r\nregulate the diffusion of heat over the globe, we must be careful, as\r\nHumboldt well remarks, not to regard the climate of Europe as a type of\r\nthe temperature which all countries placed under the same latitude\r\nenjoy. The physical sciences, observes this philosopher, always bear the\r\nimpress of the places where they began to be cultivated; and as, in\r\ngeology, an attempt was at first made to refer all the volcanic\r\nphenomena to those of the volcanoes in Italy, so in meteorology, a small\r\npart of the old world, the centre of the primitive civilization of\r\nEurope, was for a long time considered a type to which the climate of\r\nall corresponding latitudes might be referred. But this region,\r\nconstituting only one-seventh of the whole globe, proved eventually to\r\nbe the exception to the general rule. For the same reason, we may warn\r\nthe geologist to be on his guard, and not hastily to assume that the\r\ntemperature of the earth in the present era is a type of that which most\r\nusually obtains, since he contemplates far mightier alterations in the\r\nposition of land and sea, at different epochs, than those which now\r\ncause the climate of Europe to differ from that of other countries in\r\nthe same parallels.\r\n\r\nIt is now well ascertained that zones of equal warmth, both in the\r\natmosphere and in the waters of the ocean, are neither parallel to the\r\nequator nor to each other.[166] It is also known that the _mean_ annual\r\ntemperature may be the same in two places which enjoy very different\r\nclimates, for the seasons may be nearly uniform, or violently\r\ncontrasted, so that the lines of equal winter temperature do not\r\ncoincide with those of equal annual heat or isothermal lines. The\r\ndeviations of all these lines from the same parallel of latitude are\r\ndetermined by a multitude of circumstances, among the principal of which\r\nare the position, direction, and elevation of the continents and\r\nislands, the position and depths of the sea, and the direction of\r\ncurrents and of winds.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the two continents of Europe and America, it is found that\r\nplaces in the same latitudes have sometimes a mean difference of\r\ntemperature amounting to 11 degrees, or even in a few cases to 17\r\ndegrees Fahr.; and some places on the two continents, which have the\r\nsame mean temperature, differ from 7 degrees to 17 degrees in latitude.\r\nThus, Cumberland House, in North America, having the same latitude (54\r\ndegrees N.) as the city of York in England, stands on the isothermal\r\nline of 32 degrees, which in Europe rises to the North Cape, in lat. 71\r\ndegrees, but its summer heat exceeds that of Brussels or Paris.[167] The\r\nprincipal cause of greater intensity of cold in corresponding latitudes\r\nof North America, as contrasted with Europe, is the connection of\r\nAmerica with the polar circle, by a large tract of land, some of which\r\nis from three to five thousand feet in height; and, on the other hand,\r\nthe separation of Europe from the arctic circle by an ocean. The ocean\r\nhas a tendency to preserve everywhere a mean temperature, which it\r\ncommunicates to the contiguous land, so that it tempers the climate,\r\nmoderating alike an excess of heat or cold. The elevated land, on the\r\nother hand, rising to the colder regions of the atmosphere, becomes a\r\ngreat reservoir of ice and snow, arrests, condenses, and congeals vapor,\r\nand communicates its cold to the adjoining country. For this reason,\r\nGreenland, forming part of a continent which stretches northward to the\r\n82d degree of latitude, experiences under the 60th parallel a more\r\nrigorous climate than Lapland under the 72d parallel.\r\n\r\nBut if land be situated between the 40th parallel and the equator, it\r\nproduces, unless it be of extreme height, exactly the opposite effect;\r\nfor it then warms the tracts of land or sea that intervene between it\r\nand the polar circle. For the surface being in this case exposed to the\r\nvertical, or nearly vertical rays of the sun, absorbs a large quantity\r\nof heat, which it diffuses by radiation into the atmosphere. For this\r\nreason, the western parts of the old continent derive warmth from\r\nAfrica, \"which, like an immense furnace, distributes its heat to Arabia,\r\nto Turkey in Asia, and to Europe.\"[168] On the contrary, the\r\nnortheastern extremity of Asia experiences in the same latitude extreme\r\ncold; for it has land on the north between the 60th and 70th parallel,\r\nwhile to the south it is separated from the equator by the Pacific\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the more equal temperature of the waters of the ocean,\r\nthe climate of islands and of coasts differs essentially from that of\r\nthe interior of continents, the more maritime climate being\r\ncharacterized by mild winters, and more temperate summers; for the\r\nsea-breezes moderate the cold of winter, as well as the heat of summer.\r\nWhen, therefore, we trace round the globe those belts in which the mean\r\nannual temperature is the same, we often find great differences in\r\nclimate; for there are _insular_ climates in which the seasons are\r\nnearly equalized, and _excessive_ climates, as they have been termed,\r\nwhere the temperature of winter and summer is strongly contrasted. The\r\nwhole of Europe, compared with the eastern parts of America and Asia,\r\nhas an insular climate. The northern part of China, and the Atlantic\r\nregion of the United States, exhibit \"excessive climates.\" We find at\r\nNew York, says Humboldt, the summer of Rome and the winter of\r\nCopenhagen; at Quebec, the summer of Paris and the winter of Petersburg.\r\nAt Pekin, in China, where the mean temperature of the year is that of\r\nthe coasts of Brittany, the scorching heats of summer are greater than\r\nat Cairo, and the winters as rigorous as at Upsala.[169]\r\n\r\nIf lines be drawn round the globe through all those places which have\r\nthe same winter temperature, they are found to deviate from the\r\nterrestrial parallels much farther than the lines of equal mean annual\r\nheat. The lines of equal winter in Europe, for example, are often curved\r\nso as to reach parallels of latitude 9 degrees or 10 degrees distant\r\nfrom each other, whereas the isothermal lines, or those passing through\r\nplaces having the same mean annual temperature, differ only from 4\r\ndegrees to 5 degrees in Europe.\r\n\r\n_Influence of currents and drift ice on temperature._--Among other\r\ninfluential causes, both of remarkable diversity in the mean annual\r\nheat, and of unequal division of heat in the different seasons, are the\r\ndirection of currents and the accumulation and drifting of ice in high\r\nlatitudes. The temperature of the Lagullas current is 10 degrees or 12\r\ndegrees Fahr. above that of the sea at the Cape of Good Hope; for it\r\nderives the greater part of its waters from the Mozambique channel, and\r\nsoutheast coast of Africa, and from regions in the Indian Ocean much\r\nnearer the line, and much hotter than the Cape.[170] An opposite effect\r\nis produced by the \"equatorial\" current, which crosses the Atlantic from\r\nAfrica to Brazil, having a breadth varying from 160 to 450 nautical\r\nmiles. Its waters are cooler by 3 degrees or 4 degrees Fahr. than those\r\nof the ocean under the line, so that it moderates the heat of the\r\ntropics.[171]\r\n\r\nBut the effects of the Gulf stream on the climate of the North Atlantic\r\nOcean are far more remarkable. This most powerful of known currents has\r\nits source in the Gulf or Sea of Mexico, which, like the Mediterranean\r\nand other close seas in temperate or low latitudes, is warmer than the\r\nopen ocean in the same parallels. The temperature of the Mexican sea in\r\nsummer is, according to Rennell, 86 degrees Fahr., or at least 7 degrees\r\nabove that of the Atlantic in the same latitude.[172] From this great\r\nreservoir or caldron of warm water, a constant current pours forth\r\nthrough the straits of Bahama at the rate of 3 or 4 miles an hour; it\r\ncrosses the ocean in a northeasterly direction, skirting the great bank\r\nof Newfoundland, where it still retains a temperature of 8 degrees above\r\nthat of the surrounding sea. It reaches the Azores in about 78 days,\r\nafter flowing nearly 3000 geographical miles, and from thence it\r\nsometimes extends its course a thousand miles farther, so as to reach\r\nthe Bay of Biscay, still retaining an excess of 5 degrees above the mean\r\ntemperature of that sea. As it has been known to arrive there in the\r\nmonths of November and January, it may tend greatly to moderate the cold\r\nof winter in countries on the west of Europe. . There is a large tract\r\nin the centre of the North Atlantic, between the parallels of 33 degrees\r\nand 45 degrees N. lat., which Rennell calls the \"recipient of the gulf\r\nwater.\" A great part of it is covered by the weed called sargasso\r\n(_Sargassum bacciferum_), which the current floats in abundance from the\r\nGulf of Mexico. This mass of water is nearly stagnant, is warmer by 7\r\ndegrees or 10 degrees than the waters of the Atlantic, and may be\r\ncompared to the fresh water of a river overflowing the heavier salt\r\nwater of the sea. Rennell estimates the area of the \"recipient,\"\r\ntogether with that covered by the main current, as being 2000 miles in\r\nlength from E. to W., and 350 in breadth from N. to S., which, he\r\nremarks, is a larger area than that of the Mediterranean. The heat of\r\nthis great body of water is kept up by the incessant and quick arrivals\r\nof fresh supplies of warm water from the south; and there can be no\r\ndoubt that the general climate of parts of Europe and America is\r\nmaterially affected by this cause.\r\n\r\nIt is considered probable by Scoresby that the influence of the Gulf\r\nstream extends even to the sea near Spitzbergen, where its waters may\r\npass under those of melted ice; for it has been found that in the\r\nneighborhood of Spitzbergen, the water is warmer by 6 degrees or 7\r\ndegrees at the depth of one hundred and two hundred fathoms than at the\r\nsurface. This might arise from the known law that fresh water passes the\r\npoint of greatest density when cooled down below 40 degrees, and between\r\nthat and the freezing point expands again. The water of melted ice might\r\nbe lighter, both as being fresh (having lost its salt in the decomposing\r\nprocess of freezing), and because its temperature is nearer the freezing\r\npoint than the inferior water of the Gulf stream.\r\n\r\nThe great glaciers generated in the valleys of Spitzbergen, in the 79\r\ndegrees of north latitude, are almost all cut off at the beach, being\r\nmelted by the feeble remnant of heat still retained by the Gulf stream.\r\nIn Baffin's Bay, on the contrary, on the west coast of Old Greenland,\r\nwhere the temperature of the sea is not mitigated by the same cause, and\r\nwhere there is no warmer under-current, the glaciers stretch out from\r\nthe shore, and furnish repeated crops of mountainous masses of ice which\r\nfloat off into the ocean.[173] The number and dimensions of these bergs\r\nis prodigious. Captain Sir John Ross saw several of them together in\r\nBaffin's Bay aground in water fifteen hundred feet deep! Many of them\r\nare driven down into Hudson's Bay, and accumulating there, diffuse\r\nexcessive cold over the neighboring continent; so that Captain Franklin\r\nreports, that at the mouth of Hayes' River, which lies in the same\r\nlatitude as the north of Prussia or the south of Scotland, ice is found\r\neverywhere in digging wells, in summer, at the depth of four feet! Other\r\nbergs have been occasionally met with, at midsummer, in a state of rapid\r\nthaw, as far south as lat. 40 degrees and longitude about 60 degrees\r\nwest, where they cool the water sensibly to the distance of forty or\r\nfifty miles around, the thermometer sinking sometimes 17 degrees, or\r\neven 18 degrees, Fahrenheit, in their neighborhood.[174] It is a\r\nwell-known fact that every four or five years a large number of\r\nicebergs, floating from Greenland, double Cape Langaness, and are\r\nstranded on the west coast of Iceland. The inhabitants are then aware\r\nthat their crops of hay will fail, in consequence of fogs which are\r\ngenerated almost incessantly; and the dearth of food is not confined to\r\nthe land, for the temperature of the water is so changed that the fish\r\nentirely desert the coast.\r\n\r\n_Difference of climate of the Northern and Southern hemispheres._--When\r\nwe compare the climate of the northern and southern hemispheres, we\r\nobtain still more instruction in regard to the influence of the\r\ndistribution of land and sea on climate. The dry land in the southern\r\nhemisphere is to that of the northern in the ratio only of one to three,\r\nexcluding from our consideration that part which lies between the pole\r\nand the 78 degrees of south latitude, which has hitherto proved\r\ninaccessible. And whereas in the northern hemisphere, between the pole\r\nand the thirtieth parallel of north latitude, the land and sea occupy\r\nnearly equal areas, the ocean in the southern hemisphere covers no less\r\nthan fifteen parts in sixteen of the entire space included between the\r\nantarctic circle and the thirtieth parallel of south latitude.\r\n\r\nThis great extent of sea gives a particular character to climates south\r\nof the equator, the winters being mild and the summers cool. Thus, in\r\nVan Dieman's Land, corresponding nearly in latitude to Rome, the winters\r\nare more mild than at Naples, and the summers not warmer than those at\r\nParis, which is 7 degrees farther from the equator.[175] The effects on\r\nanimal and vegetable life are remarkable. Capt. King observed large\r\nshrubs of Fuchsia and Veronica, which in England are treated as tender\r\nplants, thriving and in full flower in Tierra del Fuego with the\r\ntemperature at 36 degrees. He states also that humming birds were seen\r\nsipping the sweets of the flowers \"after two or three days of constant\r\nrain, snow, and sleet, during which time the thermometer had been at the\r\nfreezing point.\" Mr. Darwin also saw parrots feeding on the seeds of a\r\ntree called the winter's bark, south of lat. 55 degrees, near Cape\r\nHorn.[176]\r\n\r\nSo the orchideous plants which are parasitical on trees, and are\r\ngenerally characteristic of the tropics, advance to the 38th and 42d\r\ndegree of S. lat., and even beyond the 45th degree in New Zealand, where\r\nthey were found by Forster. In South America also arborescent grasses\r\nabound in the dense forests of Chiloe, in lat. 42 degrees S., where\r\n\"they entwine the trees into one entangled mass to the height of thirty\r\nor forty feet above the ground. Palm-trees in the same quarter of the\r\nglobe grow in lat. 37 degrees, an arborescent grass very like a bamboo\r\nin 40 degrees, and another closely allied kind, of great length, but not\r\nerect, even as far south as 45 degrees.\"[177]\r\n\r\nIt has long been supposed that the general temperature of the southern\r\nhemisphere was considerably lower than that of the northern, and that\r\nthe difference amounted to at least 10 degrees Fahrenheit. Baron Humboldt,\r\nafter collecting and comparing a great number of observations, came to\r\nthe conclusion that even a much larger difference existed, but that none\r\nwas to be observed within the tropics, and only a small difference as\r\nfar as the thirty-fifth and fortieth parallel. Captain Cook was of\r\nopinion that the ice of the antarctic predominated greatly over that of\r\nthe arctic region, that encircling the southern pole coming nearer to\r\nthe equator by 10 degrees than the ice around the north pole. All the\r\nrecent voyages of discovery have tended to confirm this opinion,\r\nalthough Capt. Weddel penetrated, in 1823, three degrees farther south\r\nthan Capt. Cook, reaching lat. 74 degrees 15 minutes South, long. 34\r\ndegrees 17 minutes West, and Sir James Ross, in 1842, arrived at lat. 78\r\ndegrees 10 minutes S., as high a latitude, within three degrees, as the\r\nfarthest point attained by Captain Parry in the arctic circle, or lat.\r\n81 degrees 12 minutes North.\r\n\r\nThe description given by ancient as well as modern navigators of the sea\r\nand land in high southern latitudes, clearly attests the greater\r\nseverity of the climate as compared to arctic regions. In Sandwich Land,\r\nin lat. 59 degrees S., or in nearly the same parallel as the north of\r\nScotland, Capt. Cook found the whole country, from the summits of the\r\nmountains down to the very brink of the sea-cliffs, \"covered many\r\nfathoms thick with everlasting snow,\" and this on the 1st of February,\r\nthe hottest time of the year; and what is still more astonishing, in the\r\nisland of S. Georgia, which is in the 54 degrees south latitude, or the\r\nsame parallel as Yorkshire, the line of perpetual snow descends to the\r\nlevel of the ocean.[178] When we consider this fact, and then recollect\r\nthat the highest mountains in Scotland, which ascend to an elevation of\r\nnearly 5000 feet, and are four degrees farther to the north, do not\r\nattain the limit of perpetual snow on our side of the equator, we learn\r\nthat latitude is one only of many powerful causes, which determine the\r\nclimate of particular regions of the globe. Capt. Sir James Ross, in his\r\nexploring expedition in 1841-3, found that the temperature south of the\r\n60th degree of latitude seldom rose above 32 degrees Fahr. During the\r\ntwo summer months of the year 1841 (January and February) the range of\r\nthe thermometer was between 11 degrees and 32 degrees Fahr.; and\r\nscarcely once rose above the freezing point. The permanence of snow in\r\nthe southern hemisphere, is in this instance partly due to the floating\r\nice, which chills the atmosphere and condenses the vapor, so that in\r\nsummer the sun cannot pierce through the foggy air. But besides the\r\nabundance of ice which covers the sea to the south of Georgia and\r\nSandwich Land, we may also, as Humboldt suggests, ascribe the cold of\r\nthose countries in part to the absence of land between them and the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\nIf Africa and New Holland extended farther to the south, a diminution of\r\nice would take place in consequence of the radiation of heat from these\r\ncontinents during summer, which would warm the contiguous sea and rarefy\r\nthe air. The heated aerial currents would then ascend and flow more\r\nrapidly towards the south pole, and moderate the winter. In confirmation\r\nof these views, it is stated that the ice, which extends as far as the\r\n68 degrees and 71 degrees of south latitude, advances more towards the\r\nequator whenever it meets an open sea; that is, where the extremities of\r\nthe present continents are not opposite to it; and this circumstance\r\nseems explicable only on the principle above alluded to, of the\r\nradiation of heat from the lands so situated.\r\n\r\nThe cold of the antarctic regions was conjectured by Cook to be due to\r\nthe existence of a large tract of land between the seventieth degree of\r\nsouth latitude and the pole. The justness of these and other\r\nspeculations of that great navigator have since been singularly\r\nconfirmed by the investigation made by Sir James Ross in 1841. He found\r\nVictoria Land, extending from 71 degrees to 79 degrees S. latitude,\r\nskirted by a great barrier of ice, the height of the land ranging from\r\n4000 to 14,000 feet, the whole entirely covered with snow, except a\r\nnarrow ring of black earth surrounding the huge crater of the active\r\nvolcano of Mount Erebus, rising 12,400 feet above the level of the sea.\r\nThe position of a mountainous territory of such altitude, so near the\r\npole, and so obvious a source of intense cold, fully explains why\r\nGraham's and Enderby's Land, discovered by Captain Biscoe in 1831-2\r\n(between lat. 64 degrees and 68 degrees S.), presented a most wintry\r\naspect, covered even in summer with ice and snow, and nearly destitute\r\nof animal life. In corresponding latitudes of the northern hemisphere we\r\nnot only meet with herds of wild herbivorous animals, but with land\r\nwhich man himself inhabits, and where he has even built ports and inland\r\nvillages.[179]\r\n\r\nThe distance to which icebergs float from the polar regions on the\r\nopposite sides of the line is, as might have been anticipated, very\r\ndifferent. Their extreme limit in the northern hemisphere is lat. 40\r\ndegrees, as before mentioned, and they are occasionally seen in lat. 42\r\ndegrees N., near the termination of the great bank of Newfoundland, and\r\nat the Azores, lat. 42 degrees N., to which they are sometimes drifted\r\nfrom Baffin's Bay. But in the other hemisphere they have been seen,\r\nwithin the last few years, at different points off the Cape of Good\r\nHope, between lat. 36 degrees and 39 degrees.[180] One of these (see\r\nfig. 2) was two miles in circumference, and 150 feet high, appearing\r\nlike chalk when the sun was obscured, and having the lustre of refined\r\nsugar when the sun was shining on it. Others rose from 250 to 300 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea, and were therefore of great volume below;\r\nsince it is ascertained by experiments on the buoyancy of ice floating\r\nin sea-water, that for every cubic foot seen above, there must at least\r\nbe eight cubic feet below water.[181] If ice islands from the north\r\npolar regions floated as far, they might reach Cape St. Vincent, and\r\nthere, being drawn by the current that always sets in from the Atlantic\r\nthrough the Straits of Gibraltar, be drifted into the Mediterranean, so\r\nthat the serene sky of that delightful region might soon be deformed by\r\nclouds and mists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nIceberg seen off the Cape of Good Hope, April, 1829. Lat. 89 degrees 18\r\nminutes S. Long. 48 degrees 46 minutes E.]\r\n\r\nBefore the amount of difference between the temperature of the two\r\nhemispheres was ascertained, it was referred by many astronomers to the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes, or the acceleration of the earth's motion\r\nin its perihelium; in consequence of which the spring and summer of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere are now shorter, by nearly eight days, than those\r\nseasons north of the equator. But Sir J. Herschel reminds us that the\r\nexcess of eight days in the duration of the sun's presence in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere is not productive of an excess of annual light and\r\nheat; since, according to the laws of elliptic motion, it is\r\ndemonstrable that whatever be the ellipticity of the earth's orbit, the\r\ntwo hemispheres must receive _equal absolute quantities_ of light and\r\nheat per annum, the proximity of the sun in perigee exactly compensating\r\nthe effect of its swifter motion.[182] Humboldt, however, observes, that\r\nthere must be a greater loss of heat by radiation in the southern\r\nhemisphere during a winter longer by eight days than that on the other\r\nside of the equator.[183]\r\n\r\nPerhaps no very sensible effect may be produced by this source of\r\ndisturbance; yet the geologist should bear in mind that to a certain\r\nextent it operates alternately on each of the two hemispheres for a\r\nperiod of upwards of 10,000 years, dividing unequally the times during\r\nwhich the annual supply of solar light and heat is received. This cause\r\nmay sometimes tend to counterbalance inequalities of temperature\r\nresulting from other far more influential circumstances; but, on the\r\nother hand, it must sometimes tend to increase the extreme of deviation\r\narising from particular combinations of causes.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be at present the inferiority of heat in the temperate\r\nand frigid zones south of the line, it is quite evident that the cold\r\nwould be far more intense if there happened, instead of open sea, to be\r\ntracts of elevated land between the 55th and 70th parallel; and, on the\r\nother hand, the cold would be moderated if there were more land between\r\nthe line and the forty-fifth degree of south latitude.\r\n\r\n_Changes in the position of land and sea may give rise to vicissitudes\r\nin climate._--Having offered these brief remarks on the diffusion of\r\nheat over the globe in the present state of the surface, I shall now\r\nproceed to speculate on the vicissitudes of climate, which must attend\r\nthose endless variations in the geographical features of our planet\r\nwhich are contemplated in geology. That our speculations may be confined\r\nwithin the strict limits of analogy, I shall assume, 1st, That the\r\nproportion of dry land to sea continues always the same. 2dly, That the\r\nvolume of the land rising above the level of the sea is a constant\r\nquantity; and not only that its mean, but that its extreme height, is\r\nliable only to trifling variations. 3dly, That both the mean and extreme\r\ndepth of the sea are invariable; and 4thly, It may be consistent with\r\ndue caution to assume that the grouping together of the land in\r\ncontinents is a necessary part of the economy of nature; for it is\r\npossible that the laws which govern the subterranean forces, and which\r\nact simultaneously along certain lines, cannot but produce, at every\r\nepoch, continuous mountain-chains; so that the subdivision of the whole\r\nland into innumerable islands may be precluded.\r\n\r\nIf it be objected, that the maximum of elevation of land and depth of\r\nsea are probably not constant, nor the gathering together of all the\r\nland in certain parts, nor even perhaps the relative extent of land and\r\nwater, I reply, that the arguments about to be adduced will be\r\nstrengthened if, in these peculiarities of the surface, there be\r\nconsiderable deviations from the present type. If, for example, all\r\nother circumstances being the same, the land is at one time more divided\r\ninto islands than at another, a greater uniformity of climate might be\r\nproduced, the mean temperature remaining unaltered; or if, at another\r\nera, there were mountains higher than the Himalaya, these, when placed\r\nin high latitudes, would cause a greater excess of cold. Or, if we\r\nsuppose that at certain periods no chain of hills in the world rose\r\nbeyond the height of 10,000 feet, a greater heat might then have\r\nprevailed than is compatible with the existence of mountains thrice that\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\nHowever constant may be the relative proportion of sea and land, we know\r\nthat there is annually some small variation in their respective\r\ngeographical positions, and that in every century the land is in some\r\nparts raised, and in others depressed in level, and so likewise is the\r\nbed of the sea. By these and other ceaseless changes, the configuration\r\nof the earth's surface has been remodelled again and again, since it was\r\nthe habitation of organic beings, and the bed of the ocean has been\r\nlifted up to the height of some of the loftiest mountains. The\r\nimagination is apt to take alarm when called upon to admit the formation\r\nof such irregularities in the crust of the earth, after it had once\r\nbecome the habitation of living creatures; but, if time be allowed, the\r\noperation need not subvert the ordinary repose of nature; and the result\r\nis in a general view insignificant, if we consider how slightly the\r\nhighest mountain-chains cause our globe to differ from a perfect sphere.\r\nChimborazo, though it rises to more than 21,000 feet above the sea,\r\nwould be represented, on a globe of about six feet in diameter, by a\r\ngrain of sand less than one-twentieth of an inch in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe superficial inequalities of the earth, then, may be deemed minute in\r\nquantity, and their distribution at any particular epoch must be\r\nregarded in geology as temporary peculiarities, like the height and\r\noutline of the cone of Vesuvius in the interval between two eruptions.\r\nBut although, in reference to the magnitude of the globe, the unevenness\r\nof the surface is so unimportant, it is on the position and direction of\r\nthese small inequalities that the state of the atmosphere, and both the\r\nlocal and general climate, are mainly dependent.\r\n\r\nBefore considering the effect which a material change in the\r\ndistribution of land and sea must occasion, it may be well to remark,\r\nhow greatly organic life may be affected by those minor variations,\r\nwhich need not in the least degree alter the general temperature. Thus,\r\nfor example, if we suppose, by a series of convulsions, a certain part\r\nof Greenland to become sea, and, in compensation, a tract of land to\r\nrise and connect Spitzbergen with Lapland,--an accession not greater in\r\namount than one which the geologist can prove to have occurred in\r\ncertain districts bordering the Mediterranean, within a comparatively\r\nmodern period,--this altered form of the land might cause an interchange\r\nbetween the climate of certain parts of North America and of Europe,\r\nwhich lie in corresponding latitudes. Many European species of plants\r\nand animals would probably perish in consequence, because the mean\r\ntemperature would be greatly lowered; and others would fail in America,\r\nbecause it would there be raised. On the other hand, in places where the\r\nmean annual heat remained unaltered, some species which flourish in\r\nEurope, where the seasons are more uniform, would be unable to resist\r\nthe greater heat of the North American summer, or the intenser cold of\r\nthe winter; while others, now fitted by their habits for the great\r\ncontrast of the American seasons, would not be fitted for the _insular_\r\nclimate of Europe. The vine, for example, according to Humboldt, can be\r\ncultivated with advantage 10 degrees farther north in Europe than in North\r\nAmerica. Many plants endure severe frost, but cannot ripen their seeds\r\nwithout a certain intensity of summer heat and a certain quantity of\r\nlight; others cannot endure a similar intensity either of heat or cold.\r\n\r\nIt is now established that many of the existing species of animals have\r\nsurvived great changes in the physical geography of the globe. If such\r\nspecies be termed modern, in comparison to races which preceded them,\r\ntheir remains, nevertheless, enter into submarine deposits many hundred\r\nmiles in length, and which have since been raised from the deep to no\r\ninconsiderable altitude. When, therefore, it is shown that changes in\r\nthe temperature of the atmosphere may be the consequence of such\r\nphysical revolutions of the surface, we ought no longer to wonder that\r\nwe find the distribution of existing species to be _local_, in regard to\r\n_longitude_ as well as latitude. If all species were now, by an exertion\r\nof creative power, to be diffused uniformly throughout those zones where\r\nthere is an equal degree of heat, and in all respects a similarity of\r\nclimate, they would begin from this moment to depart more and more from\r\ntheir original distribution. Aquatic and terrestrial species would be\r\ndisplaced, as Hooke long ago observed, so often as land and water\r\nexchanged places; and there would also, by the formation of new\r\nmountains and other changes, be transpositions of climate, contributing,\r\nin the manner before alluded to, to the local extermination of\r\nspecies.[184]\r\n\r\nIf we now proceed to consider the circumstances required for a _general_\r\nchange of temperature, it will appear, from the facts and principles\r\nalready laid down, that whenever a greater extent of high land is\r\ncollected in the polar regions, the cold will augment; and the same\r\nresult will be produced when there is more sea between or near the\r\ntropics; while, on the contrary, so often as the above conditions are\r\nreversed, the heat will be greater. (See figs. 5 and 6, p. 111.) If this\r\nbe admitted, it will follow, that unless the superficial inequalities of\r\nthe earth be fixed and permanent, there must be never-ending\r\nfluctuations in the mean temperature of every zone; and that the climate\r\nof one era can no more be a type of every other; than is one of our four\r\nseasons of all the rest.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said, that the earth is covered by an ocean, in the\r\nmidst of which are two great islands, and many smaller ones; for the\r\nwhole of the continents and islands occupy an area scarcely exceeding\r\none-fourth of the whole superficies of the spheroid. Now, according to\r\nthis analogy, we may fairly speculate on the probability that there\r\nwould not be usually, at any given epoch of the past, more than about\r\none-fourth dry land in a particular region; as, for example, near the\r\npoles, or between them and the 75th parallels of N. and S. latitude.\r\nIf, therefore, at present there should happen to be, in both these\r\nquarters of the globe, much _more_ than this average proportion of land,\r\nsome of it in the arctic region, being above, five thousand feet in\r\nheight, and if in antarctic latitudes a mountainous country has been\r\nfound varying from 4000 to 14,000 feet in height, this alone affords\r\nground for concluding that, in the present state of things, the mean\r\nheat of the climate is below that which the earth's surface, in its more\r\nordinary state, would enjoy. This presumption is heightened when we\r\nreflect on the results of the recent soundings made by Sir James Ross,\r\nin the Southern Ocean, and continued for four successive years, ending\r\n1844, which seem to prove that the mean depth of the Atlantic and\r\nPacific is as great as Laplace and other eminent astronomers had\r\nimagined;[185] for then we might look not only for more than two-thirds\r\nsea in the frigid zones, but for water of great depth, which could not\r\nreadily be reduced to the freezing point. The same opinion is confirmed,\r\nwhen we compare the quantity of land lying between the poles and the\r\n30th parallels of north and south latitude, with the quantity placed\r\nbetween those parallels and the equator; for, it is clear, that we have\r\nat present not only more than the usual degree of cold in the polar\r\nregions, but also less than the average quantity of heat within the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\n_Position of land and sea which might produce the extreme of cold of\r\nwhich the earth's surface is susceptible._--To simplify our view of the\r\nvarious changes in climate, which different combinations of geographical\r\ncircumstances may produce, we shall first consider the conditions\r\nnecessary for bringing about the extreme of cold, or what would have\r\nbeen termed in the language of the old writers the winter of the \"great\r\nyear,\" or geological cycle, and afterwards, the conditions requisite to\r\nproduce the maximum of heat, or the summer of the same year.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the northern hemisphere. Let us suppose those hills of the\r\nItalian peninsula and of Sicily, which are of comparatively modern\r\norigin, and contain many fossil shells identical with living species, to\r\nsubside again into the sea, from which they have been raised, and that\r\nan extent of land of equal area and height (varying from one to three\r\nthousand feet) should rise up in the Arctic Ocean between Siberia and\r\nthe north pole. In speaking of such changes, I shall not allude to the\r\nmanner in which I conceive it possible that they may be brought about,\r\nnor of the time required for their accomplishment--reserving for a\r\nfuture occasion, not only the proofs that revolutions of equal magnitude\r\nhave taken place, but that analogous operations are still in gradual\r\nprogress. The alteration now supposed in the physical geography of the\r\nnorthern regions, would cause additional snow and ice to accumulate\r\nwhere now there is usually an open sea; and the temperature of the\r\ngreater part of Europe would be somewhat lowered, so as to resemble more\r\nnearly that of corresponding latitudes of North America: or, in other\r\nwords, it might be necessary to travel about 10 degrees farther south in\r\norder to meet with the same climate which we now enjoy. No compensation\r\nwould be derived from the disappearance of land in the Mediterranean\r\ncountries; but the contrary, since the mean heat of the soil in those\r\nlatitudes probably exceeds that which would belong to the sea, by which\r\nwe imagine it to be replaced.\r\n\r\nBut let the configuration of the surface be still farther varied, and\r\nlet some large district within or near the tropics, such as Brazil, with\r\nits plains and hills of moderate height, be converted into sea, while\r\nlands of equal elevation and extent rise up in the arctic circle. From\r\nthis change there would, in the first place, result a sensible\r\ndiminution of temperature near the tropic, for the Brazilian soil would\r\nno longer be heated by the sun; so that the atmosphere would be less\r\nwarm, as also the neighboring Atlantic. On the other hand, the whole of\r\nEurope, Northern Asia, and North America, would be chilled by the\r\nenormous quantity of ice and snow, thus generated on the new arctic\r\ncontinent. If, as we have already seen, there are now some points in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere where snow is perpetual down to the level of the\r\nsea, in latitudes as low as central England, such might assuredly be the\r\ncase throughout a great part of Europe, under the change of\r\ncircumstances above supposed: and if at present the extreme range of\r\ndrifted icebergs is the Azores, they might easily reach the equator\r\nafter the assumed alteration. But to pursue the subject still farther,\r\nlet the Himalaya mountains, with the whole of Hindostan, sink down, and\r\ntheir place be occupied by the Indian Ocean, while an equal extent of\r\nterritory and mountains, of the same vast height, rise up between North\r\nGreenland and the Orkney Islands. It seems difficult to exaggerate the\r\namount to which the climate of the northern hemisphere would then be\r\ncooled.[186]\r\n\r\nBut the refrigeration brought about at the same time in the southern\r\nhemisphere, would be nearly equal, and the difference of temperature\r\nbetween the arctic and equatorial latitudes would not be much greater\r\nthan at present; for no important disturbance can occur in the climate\r\nof a particular region without its immediately affecting all other\r\nlatitudes, however remote. The heat and cold which surround the globe\r\nare in a state of constant and universal flux and reflux. The heated and\r\nrarefied air is always rising and flowing from the equator towards the\r\npoles in the higher regions of the atmosphere; while in the lower, the\r\ncolder air is flowing back to restore the equilibrium. That this\r\ncirculation is constantly going on in the aerial currents is not\r\ndisputed; it is often proved by the opposite course of the clouds at\r\ndifferent heights, and the fact has been farther illustrated in a\r\nstriking manner by two recent events. The trade wind continually blows\r\nwith great force from the island of Barbadoes to that of St. Vincent;\r\nnotwithstanding which, during the eruption of the volcano in the island\r\nof St. Vincent, in 1812, ashes fell in profusion from a great height in\r\nthe atmosphere upon Barbadoes.[187] In like manner, during the great\r\neruption of Sumbawa, in 1815, ashes were carried to the islands of\r\nAmboyna and Banda, which last is about 800 miles east from the site of\r\nthe volcano. Yet the southeast monsoon was then at its height.[188] This\r\napparent transposition of matter against the wind, confirmed the opinion\r\nof the existence of a counter-current in the higher regions, which had\r\npreviously rested on theoretical conclusions only.\r\n\r\nThat a corresponding interchange takes place in the seas, is\r\ndemonstrated, according to Humboldt, by the cold which is found to exist\r\nat great depths within the tropics; and, among other proofs, may be\r\nmentioned the mass of warmer water which the Gulf stream is constantly\r\nbearing northwards, while a cooler current flows _from_ the north along\r\nthe coast of Greenland and Labrador, and helps to restore the\r\nequilibrium.[189]\r\n\r\nCurrents of colder and therefore specifically heavier water pass from\r\nthe poles towards the equator, which cool the inferior parts of the\r\nocean; so that the heat of the torrid zone and the cold of the polar\r\ncircle balance each other. The refrigeration, therefore, of the polar\r\nregions, resulting from the supposed alteration in the distribution of\r\nland and sea, would be immediately communicated to the tropics, and from\r\nthem its influence would extend to the antarctic circle, where the\r\natmosphere and the ocean would be cooled, so that ice and snow would\r\naugment. Although the mean temperature of higher latitudes in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere is, as before stated, for the most part, lower than\r\nthat of the same parallels in the northern, yet, for a considerable\r\nspace on each side of the line, the mean annual heat of the waters is\r\nfound to be the same in corresponding parallels. If, therefore, by the\r\nnew position of the land, the formation of icebergs had become of common\r\noccurrence in the northern temperate zone, and if these were frequently\r\ndrifted as far as the equator, the same degree of cold which they\r\ngenerated would immediately be communicated as far as the tropic of\r\nCapricorn, and from thence to the lands or ocean to the south.\r\n\r\nThe freedom, then, of the circulation of heat and cold from pole to pole\r\nbeing duly considered, it will be evident that the mean temperature\r\nwhich may prevail at the same point at two distinct periods, may differ\r\nfar more widely than that of any two points in the same parallels of\r\nlatitude, at one and the same period. For the range of temperature, or\r\nin other words, the curvature of the isothermal lines in a given zone,\r\nand at a given period, must always be circumscribed within narrow\r\nlimits, the climate of each place in that zone being controlled by the\r\ncombined influence of the geographical peculiarities of all other parts\r\nof the earth. Whereas, if we compare the state of things at two distinct\r\nand somewhat distant epochs, a particular zone may at one time be under\r\nthe influence of one class of disturbing causes, and at another time may\r\nbe affected by an opposite combination. The lands, for example, to the\r\nnorth of Greenland cause the present climate of North America to be\r\ncolder than that of Europe in the same latitudes; but the excess of cold\r\nis not so great as it would have been if the western hemisphere had been\r\nentirely isolated, or separated from the eastern like a distinct planet.\r\nFor not only does the refrigeration produced by Greenland chill to a\r\ncertain extent the atmosphere of northern and western Europe, but the\r\nmild climate of Europe reacts also upon North America, and moderates the\r\nchilling influence of the adjoining polar lands.\r\n\r\nTo return to the state of the earth after the changes above supposed, we\r\nmust not omit to dwell on the important effects to which a wide expanse\r\nof perpetual snow would give rise. It is probable that nearly the whole\r\nsea, from the poles to the parallels of 45 degrees, would be frozen\r\nover; for it is well known that the immediate proximity of land is not\r\nessential to the formation and increase of field ice, provided there be\r\nin some part of the same zone a sufficient quantity of glaciers\r\ngenerated on or near the land, to cool down the sea. Captain Scoresby,\r\nin his account of the arctic regions, observes, that when the sun's rays\r\n\"fall upon the snow-clad surface of the ice or land, they are in a great\r\nmeasure reflected, without producing any material elevation of\r\ntemperature; but when they impinge on the black exterior of a ship, the\r\npitch on one side occasionally becomes fluid while ice is rapidly\r\ngenerated at the other.\"[190]\r\n\r\nNow field ice is almost always covered with snow;[191] and thus not only\r\nland as extensive as our existing continents, but immense tracts of sea\r\nin the frigid and temperate zones, might present a solid surface covered\r\nwith snow, and reflecting the sun's rays for the greater part of the\r\nyear. Within the tropics, moreover, where the ocean now predominates,\r\nthe sky would no longer be serene and clear, as in the present era; but\r\nmasses of floating ice would cause quick condensations of vapor, so that\r\nfogs and clouds would deprive the vertical rays of the sun of half their\r\npower. The whole planet, therefore, would receive annually a smaller\r\nportion of the solar influence, and the external crust would part, by\r\nradiation, with some of the heat which had been accumulated in it,\r\nduring a different state of the surface. This heat would be dissipated\r\nin the spaces surrounding our atmosphere, which, according to the\r\ncalculations of M. Fourier, have a temperature much inferior to that of\r\nfreezing water.\r\n\r\nAfter the geographical revolution above assumed, the climate of\r\nequinoctial lands might be brought at last to resemble that of the\r\npresent temperate zone, or perhaps be far more wintry. They who should\r\nthen inhabit such small isles and coral reefs as are now seen in the\r\nIndian Ocean and South Pacific, would wonder that zoophytes of large\r\ndimensions had once been so prolific in their seas; or if, perchance,\r\nthey found the wood and fruit of the cocoa-nut tree or the palm\r\nsilicified by the waters of some ancient mineral spring, or incrusted\r\nwith calcareous matter, they would muse on the revolutions which had\r\nannihilated such genera, and replaced them by the oak, the chestnut, and\r\nthe pine. With equal admiration would they compare the skeletons of\r\ntheir small lizards with the bones of fossil alligators and crocodiles\r\nmore than twenty feet in length, which, at a former epoch, had\r\nmultiplied between the tropics: and when they saw a pine included in an\r\niceberg, drifted from latitudes which we now call temperate, they would\r\nbe astonished at the proof thus afforded, that forests had once grown\r\nwhere nothing could be seen in their own times but a wilderness of snow.\r\n\r\nIf the reader hesitate to suppose so extensive an alteration of\r\ntemperature as the probable consequence of geographical changes,\r\nconfined to one hemisphere, he should remember how great are the local\r\nanomalies in climate now resulting from the peculiar distribution of\r\nland and sea in certain regions. Thus, in the island of South Georgia,\r\nbefore mentioned (p. 98), Captain Cook found the everlasting snows\r\ndescending to the level of the sea, between lat. 54 degrees and 55\r\ndegrees S.; no trees or shrubs were to be seen, and in summer a few\r\nrocks only, after a partial melting of the ice and snow, were scantily\r\ncovered with moss and tufts of grass. If such a climate can now exist at\r\nthe level of the sea in a latitude corresponding to that of Yorkshire in\r\nspite of all those equalizing causes before enumerated, by which the\r\nmixture of the temperatures of distant regions is facilitated throughout\r\nthe globe, what rigors might we not anticipate in a winter generated by\r\nthe transfer of the mountains of India to our arctic circle!\r\n\r\nBut we have still to contemplate the additional refrigeration which\r\nmight be effected by changes in the relative position of land and sea in\r\nthe southern hemisphere. If the remaining continents were transferred\r\nfrom the equatorial and contiguous latitudes to the south polar regions,\r\nthe intensity of cold produced might, perhaps, render the globe\r\nuninhabitable. We are too ignorant of the laws governing the direction\r\nof subterranean forces, to determine whether such a crisis be within the\r\nlimits of possibility. At the same time, it may be observed, that no\r\ndistribution of land can well be imagined more irregular, or, as it\r\nwere, capricious, than that which now prevails; for at present, the\r\nglobe may be divided into two equal parts, in such a manner, that one\r\nhemisphere shall be almost entirely covered with water, while the other\r\nshall contain less water than land (see figs. 3 and 4);[192] and, what\r\nis still more extraordinary, on comparing the extratropical lands in the\r\nnorthern and southern hemispheres, the lands in the northern are found\r\nto be to those in the southern in the proportion of thirteen to\r\none![193] To imagine all the lands, therefore, in high, and all the sea\r\nin low latitudes, as delineated in fig. 6, p. 111, would scarcely be a\r\nmore anomalous state of the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map showing the present unequal Distribution of LAND and\r\nWATER on the Surface of the GLOBE.\r\n\r\nFig. 3. Here London is taken as a centre, and we behold the greatest\r\nquantity of land existing in one hemisphere.\r\n\r\nFig. 4. Here the centre is the antipodal point to London, and we see the\r\ngreatest quantity of water existing in one hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe black shading expresses land having land opposite or antipodal to\r\nit.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Maps showing the position of LAND and SEA which might\r\nproduce the Extremes of HEAT and COLD in the Climates of the GLOBE.\r\n\r\nFig. 5.\r\n\r\nExtreme of Heat.\r\n\r\nFig. 6.\r\n\r\nExtreme of Cold.\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS.--These maps are intended to show that continents and\r\nislands having the same shape and relative dimensions as those now\r\nexisting, might be placed so as to occupy either the equatorial or polar\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nIn fig. 5, scarcely any of the land extends from the equator towards the\r\npoles beyond the 30th parallel of latitude; and fig. 6, a very small\r\nproportion of it extends from the poles towards the Equator beyond the\r\n40th parallel of latitude.\r\n\r\n_Position of land and sea which might give rise to the extreme of\r\nheat._--Let us now turn from the contemplation of the winter of the\r\n\"great year,\" and consider the opposite train of circumstances which\r\nwould bring on the spring and summer. To imagine all the lands to be\r\ncollected together in equatorial latitudes, and a few promontories only\r\nto project beyond the thirtieth parallel, as represented in the annexed\r\nmaps (figs. 5 and 6), would be undoubtedly to suppose an extreme result\r\nof geological change. But if we consider a mere approximation to such a\r\nstate of things, it would be sufficient to cause a general elevation of\r\ntemperature. Nor can it be regarded as a visionary idea, that amidst the\r\nrevolutions of the earth's surface, the quantity of land should, at\r\ncertain periods, have been simultaneously lessened in the vicinity of\r\nboth the poles, and increased within the tropics. We must recollect that\r\neven now it is necessary to ascend to the height of fifteen thousand\r\nfeet in the Andes under the line, and in the Himalaya mountains, which\r\nare without the tropic, to seventeen thousand feet, before we reach the\r\nlimit of perpetual snow. On the northern slope, indeed, of the Himalaya\r\nrange, where the heat radiated from a great continent moderates the\r\ncold, there are meadows and cultivated land at an elevation equal to the\r\nheight of Mont Blanc.[194] If then there were no arctic lands to chill\r\nthe atmosphere, and freeze the sea, and if the loftiest chains were near\r\nthe line, it seems reasonable to imagine that the highest mountains\r\nmight be clothed with a rich vegetation to their summits, and that\r\nnearly all signs of frost would disappear from the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen the absorption of the solar rays was in no region impeded, even in\r\nwinter, by a coat of snow, the mean heat of the earth's crust would\r\naugment to considerable depths, and springs, which we know to be in\r\ngeneral an index of the mean temperature of the climate, would be warmer\r\nin all latitudes. The waters of lakes, therefore, and rivers, would be\r\nmuch hotter in winter, and would be never chilled in summer by melted\r\nsnow and ice. A remarkable uniformity of climate would prevail amid the\r\narchipelagoes of the temperate and polar oceans, where the tepid waters\r\nof equatorial currents would freely circulate. The general humidity of\r\nthe atmosphere would far exceed that of the present period, for\r\nincreased heat would promote evaporation in all parts of the globe. The\r\nwinds would be first heated in their passage over the tropical plains,\r\nand would then gather moisture from the surface of the deep, till,\r\ncharged with vapor, they arrived at extreme northern and southern\r\nregions, and there encountering a cooler atmosphere, discharged their\r\nburden in warm rain. If, during the long night of a polar winter, the\r\nsnows should whiten the summits of some arctic islands, they would be\r\ndissolved as rapidly by the returning sun, as are the snows of Etna by\r\nthe blasts of the sirocco.\r\n\r\nWe learn from those who have studied the geographical distribution of\r\nplants, that in very low latitudes, at present, the vegetation of small\r\nislands remote from continents has a peculiar character; the ferns and\r\nallied families, in particular, bearing a great proportion to the total\r\nnumber of other plants. Other circumstances being the same, the more\r\nremote the isles are from the continents, the greater does this\r\nproportion become. Thus, in the continent of India, and the tropical\r\nparts of New Holland, the proportion of ferns to the phaenogamous plants\r\nis only as one to twenty-six; whereas, in the South-Sea Islands, it is\r\nas one to four, or even as one to three.[195]\r\n\r\nWe might expect, therefore, in the summer of the \"great year,\" or cycle\r\nof climate, that there would be a predominance of tree ferns and plants\r\nallied to genera now called tropical, in the islands of the wide ocean,\r\nwhile many forms now confined to arctic and temperate regions, or only\r\nfound near the equator on the summit of the loftiest mountains, would\r\nalmost disappear from the earth. Then might those genera of animals\r\nreturn, of which the memorials are preserved in the ancient rocks of our\r\ncontinents. The pterodactyle might flit again through the air, the huge\r\niguanodon reappear in the woods, and the ichthyosaurs swarm once more in\r\nthe sea. Coral reefs might be prolonged again beyond the arctic circle,\r\nwhere the whale and the narwal now abound; and droves of turtles might\r\nbegin again to wander through regions now tenanted by the walrus and the\r\nseal.\r\n\r\nBut not to indulge too far in these speculations, I may observe, in\r\nconclusion, that however great, during the lapse of ages, may be the\r\nvicissitudes of temperature in every zone, it accords with this theory\r\nthat the general climate should not experience any sensible change in\r\nthe course of a few thousand years; because that period is insufficient\r\nto affect the leading features of the physical geography of the globe.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the apparent uncertainty of the seasons, it is found\r\nthat the mean temperature of particular localities is very constant,\r\nwhen observations made for a sufficient series of years are compared.\r\n\r\nYet there must be exceptions to this rule; and even the labors of man\r\nhave, by the drainage of lakes and marshes, and the felling of extensive\r\nforests, caused such changes in the atmosphere as greatly to raise our\r\nconception of the more important influence of those forces to which, in\r\ncertain latitudes, even the existence of land or water, hill or valley,\r\nlake or sea, must be ascribed. If we possessed accurate information of\r\nthe amount of _local_ fluctuation in climate in the course of twenty\r\ncenturies, it would often, undoubtedly, be considerable. Certain tracts,\r\nfor example, on the coast of Holland and of England consisted of\r\ncultivated land in the time of the Romans, which the sea, by gradual\r\nencroachments, has at length occupied. Here, at least, a slight\r\nalteration has been effected; for neither the distribution of heat in\r\nthe different seasons, nor the mean annual temperature of the atmosphere\r\ninvesting the sea, is precisely the same as that which rests upon the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIn those countries, also, where earthquakes and volcanoes are in full\r\nactivity, a much shorter period may produce a sensible variation. The\r\nclimate of the great table-land of Malpais in Mexico, must differ\r\nmaterially from that which prevailed before the middle of the last\r\ncentury; for, since that time, six mountains, the highest of them rising\r\nsixteen hundred feet above the plateau, have been thrown up by volcanic\r\neruptions. It is by the repetition of an indefinite number of such local\r\nrevolutions, and by slow movements extending simultaneously over wider\r\nareas, as will be afterwards shown, that a general change of climate may\r\nfinally be brought about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nON FORMER CHANGES IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Geographical features of the northern hemisphere, at the period of\r\n    the oldest fossiliferous strata--State of the surface when the\r\n    mountain limestone and coal were deposited--Changes in physical\r\n    geography, between the carboniferous period and the chalk--Abrupt\r\n    transition from the secondary to the tertiary fossils--Accession of\r\n    land, and elevation of mountain chains, after the consolidation of\r\n    the secondary rocks--Explanation of Map, showing the area covered by\r\n    sea, since the commencement of the tertiary period--Astronomical\r\n    theories of the causes of variations in climate--Theory of the\r\n    diminution of the supposed primitive heat of the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the sixth chapter, I stated the arguments derived from organic\r\nremains for concluding that in the period when the carboniferous strata\r\nwere deposited, the temperature of the ocean and the air was more\r\nuniform in the different seasons of the year, and in different\r\nlatitudes, than at present, and that there was a remarkable absence of\r\ncold as well as great moisture in the atmosphere. It was also shown that\r\nthe climate had been modified more than once since that epoch, and that\r\nit had been reduced, by successive changes, more and more nearly to that\r\nnow prevailing in the same latitudes. Farther, I endeavored, in the last\r\nchapter, to prove that vicissitudes in climate of no less importance may\r\nbe expected to recur in future, if it be admitted that causes now active\r\nin nature have power, in the lapse of ages, to produce considerable\r\nvariations in the relative position of land and sea. It remains to\r\ninquire whether the alterations, which the geologist can prove to have\r\n_actually taken place_ at former periods, in the geographical features\r\nof the northern hemisphere, coincide in their nature, and in the time of\r\ntheir occurrence, with such revolutions in climate as might naturally\r\nhave resulted, according to the meteorological principles already\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n_Period of the primary fossiliferous rocks._--The oldest system of\r\nstrata which afford by their organic remains any evidence as to climate,\r\nor the former position of land and sea, are those formerly known as the\r\n_transition rocks_, or what have since been termed Lower Silurian or\r\n\"primary fossiliferous\" formations. These have been found in England,\r\nFrance, Germany, Sweden, Russia, and other parts of central and northern\r\nEurope, as also in the great Lake district of Canada and the United\r\nStates. The multilocular or chambered univalves, including the Nautilus,\r\nand the corals, obtained from the limestones of these ancient groups,\r\nhave been compared to forms now most largely developed in tropical seas.\r\nThe corals, however, have been shown by M. Milne Edwards to differ\r\ngenerally from all living zoophytes; so that conclusions as to a warmer\r\nclimate drawn from such remote analogies must be received with caution.\r\nHitherto, few, if any, contemporaneous vegetable remains have been\r\nnoticed; but such as are mentioned agree more nearly with the plants of\r\nthe carboniferous era than any other, and would therefore imply a warm\r\nand humid atmosphere entirely free from intense cold throughout the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThis absence or great scarcity of plants as well as of freshwater shells\r\nand other indications of neighboring land, coupled with the wide extent\r\nof marine strata of this age in Europe and North America, are facts\r\nwhich imply such a state of physical geography (so far at least as\r\nregards the northern hemisphere) as would, according to the principles\r\nbefore explained, give rise to such a moist and equable climate. (See p.\r\n109, and fig. 5, p. 111.)\r\n\r\n_Carboniferous group._--This group comes next in the order of\r\nsuccession; and one of its principal members, the mountain limestone,\r\nwas evidently a marine formation, as is shown by the shells and corals\r\nwhich it contains. That the ocean of that period was of considerable\r\nextent in our latitudes, we may infer from the continuity of these\r\ncalcareous strata over large areas in Europe, Canada, and the United\r\nStates. The same group has also been traced in North America, towards\r\nthe borders of the arctic sea.[196]\r\n\r\nThere are also several regions in Scotland, and in the central and\r\nnorthern parts of England, as well as in the United States, where marine\r\ncarboniferous limestones alternate with strata containing coal, in such\r\na manner as to imply the drifting down of plants by rivers into the sea,\r\nand the alternate occupation of the same space by fresh and salt water.\r\n\r\nSince the time of the earlier writers, no strata have been more\r\nextensively investigated, both in Europe and North America, than those\r\nof the ancient carboniferous group, and the progress of science has led\r\nto a general belief that a large portion of the purest coal has been\r\nformed, not, as was once imagined, by vegetable matter floated from a\r\ndistance, but by plants which grew on the spot, and somewhat in the\r\nmanner of peat on the spaces now covered by the beds of coal. The former\r\nexistence of land in some of these spaces has been proved, as already\r\nstated, by the occurrence of numerous upright fossil trees, with their\r\nroots terminating downwards in seams of coal; and still more generally\r\nby the roots of trees (stigmariae) remaining in their natural position in\r\nthe clays which underlie almost every layer of coal.\r\n\r\nAs some nearly continuous beds of such coal have of late years been\r\ntraced in North America, over areas 100 or 200 miles and upwards in\r\ndiameter, it may be asked whether the large tracts of ancient land\r\nimplied by this fact are not inconsistent with the hypothesis of the\r\ngeneral prevalence of islands at the period under consideration? In\r\nreply, I may observe that the coal-fields must originally have been low\r\nalluvial grounds, resembling in situation the cypress-swamps of the\r\nMississippi, or the sunderbunds of the Ganges, being liable like them to\r\nbe inundated at certain periods by a river or by the sea, if the land\r\nshould be depressed a few feet. All the phenomena, organic and\r\ninorganic, imply conditions nowhere to be met with except in the deltas\r\nof large rivers. We have to account for an abundant supply of fluviatile\r\nsediment, carried for ages towards one and the same region, and capable\r\nof forming strata of mud and sand thousands of feet, or even fathoms, in\r\nthickness, many of them consisting of laminated shale, inclosing the\r\nleaves of ferns and other terrestrial plants. We have also to explain\r\nthe frequent intercalations of root-beds, and the interposition here and\r\nthere of brackish and marine deposits, demonstrating the occasional\r\npresence of the neighboring sea. But these forest-covered deltas could\r\nonly have been formed at the termination of large hydrographical basins,\r\neach drained by a great river and its tributaries; and the accumulation\r\nof sediment bears testimony to contemporaneous denudation on a large\r\nscale, and, therefore, to a wide area of land, probably containing\r\nwithin it one or more mountain chains.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the great Ohio or Appalachian coal-field, the largest in\r\nthe world, it seems clear that the uplands drained by one or more great\r\nrivers were chiefly to the eastward, or they occupied a space now filled\r\nby part of the Atlantic Ocean, for the mechanical deposits of mud and\r\nsand increase greatly in thickness and coarseness of material as we\r\napproach the eastern borders of the coal-field, or the southeast flanks\r\nof the Alleghany mountains, near Philadelphia. In that region numerous\r\nbeds of pebbles, often of the size of a hen's egg, are seen to alternate\r\nwith beds of pure coal.\r\n\r\nBut the American coal-fields are all comprised within the 30th and 50th\r\ndegrees of north latitude; and there is no reason to presume that the\r\nlands at the borders of which they originated ever penetrated so far or\r\nin such masses into the colder and arctic regions, so as to generate a\r\ncold climate. In the southern hemisphere, where the predominance of sea\r\nover land is now the distinguishing geographical feature, we\r\nnevertheless find a large part of the continent of Australia, as well as\r\nNew Zealand, placed between the 30th and 50th degrees of S. latitude.\r\nThe two islands of New Zealand taken together, are between 800 and 900\r\nmiles in length, with a breadth in some parts of ninety miles, and they\r\nstretch as far south as the 46th degree of latitude. They afford,\r\ntherefore, a wide area for the growth of a terrestrial vegetation, and\r\nthe botany of this region is characterized by abundance of ferns, one\r\nhundred and forty species of which are already known, some of them\r\nattaining the size of trees. In this respect the southern shores of New\r\nZealand in the 46th degree of latitude almost vie with tropical islands.\r\nAnother point of resemblance between the Flora of New Zealand and that\r\nof the ancient carboniferous period is the prevalence of the fir tribe\r\nor of coniferous wood.\r\n\r\nAn argument of some weight in corroboration of the theory above\r\nexplained respecting the geographical condition of the temperate and\r\narctic latitudes of the northern hemisphere in the carboniferous period\r\nmay also be derived from ah examination of those groups of strata which\r\nimmediately preceded the coal. The fossils of the Devonian and Silurian\r\nstrata in Europe and North America have led to the conclusion, that they\r\nwere formed for the most part in deep seas, far from land. In those\r\nolder strata land plants are almost as rare as they are abundant or\r\nuniversal in the coal measures. Those ancient deposits, therefore, may\r\nbe supposed to have belonged to an epoch when dry land had only just\r\nbegun to be upraised from the deep; a theory which would imply the\r\nexistence during the carboniferous epoch of islands, instead of an\r\nextensive continent, in the area where the coal was formed.\r\n\r\nSuch a state of things prevailing in the north, from the pole to the\r\n30th parallel of latitude, if not neutralized by circumstances of a\r\ncontrary tendency in corresponding regions south of the line, would give\r\nrise to a general warmth and uniformity of climate throughout the globe.\r\n\r\n_Changes in physical geography between the formation of the\r\ncarboniferous strata and the chalk._--We have evidence in England that\r\nthe strata of the ancient carboniferous group, already adverted to,\r\nwere, in many instances, fractured and contorted, and often thrown into\r\na vertical position, before the deposition of some even of the oldest\r\nknown secondary rocks, such as the new red sandstone.\r\n\r\nFragments of the older formations are sometimes included in the\r\nconglomerates of the more modern; and some of these fragments still\r\nretain their fossil shells and corals, so as to enable us to determine\r\nthe parent rocks from whence they were derived. There are other proofs\r\nof the disturbance at successive epochs of different secondary rocks\r\nbefore the deposition of others; and satisfactory evidence that, during\r\nthese reiterated convulsions, the geographical features of the northern\r\nhemisphere were frequently modified, and that from time to time new\r\nlands emerged from the deep. The vegetation, during some parts of the\r\nperiod in question (from the lias to the chalk inclusive), when genera\r\nallied to Cycas and Zamia were abundant, appears to have approached to\r\nthat of the larger islands of the equatorial zone; such, for example, as\r\nwe now find in the West Indian archipelago.[197] These islands appear to\r\nhave been drained by rivers of considerable size, which were inhabited\r\nby crocodiles and gigantic oviparous reptiles, both herbivorous and\r\ncarnivorous, belonging for the most part to extinct genera. Of the\r\ncontemporary inhabitants of the land we have as yet acquired but scanty\r\ninformation, but we know that there were flying reptiles, insects, and\r\nsmall mammifers, allied to the marsupial tribes.\r\n\r\nA freshwater deposit, called the Wealden, occurs in the upper part of\r\nthe secondary series of the south of England, which, by its extent and\r\nfossils, attests the existence in that region of a large river draining\r\na continent or island of considerable dimensions. We know that this land\r\nwas clothed with wood, and inhabited by huge terrestrial reptiles and\r\nbirds. Its position so far to the north as the counties of Surrey and\r\nSussex, at a time when the mean temperature of the climate is supposed\r\nto have been much hotter than at present, may at first sight appear\r\ninconsistent with the theory before explained, that the heat was caused\r\nby the gathering together of all the great masses of land in low\r\nlatitudes, while the northern regions were almost entirely sea. But it\r\nmust not be taken for granted that the geographical conditions already\r\ndescribed (p. 109, and fig. 5, p. 111) as capable of producing the\r\nextreme of heat were ever combined at any geological period of which we\r\nhave yet obtained information. It is more probable, from what has been\r\nstated in the preceding chapters, that a slight approximation to such an\r\nextreme state of things would be sufficient; in other words, if most of\r\nthe dry land were tropical, and scarcely any of it arctic or antarctic,\r\na prodigious elevation of temperature must ensue, even though a part of\r\nsome continents should penetrate far into the temperate zones.\r\n\r\n_Changes during the tertiary periods._--The secondary and tertiary\r\nformations of Europe, when considered separately, may be contrasted as\r\nhaving very different characters; the secondary appearing to have been\r\ndeposited in open seas, the tertiary in regions where dry land, lakes,\r\nbays, and perhaps inland seas, abounded. The secondary series is almost\r\nexclusively marine; the tertiary, even the oldest part, contains\r\nlacustrine strata, and not unfrequently freshwater and marine beds\r\nalternating. In fact there is evidence of important geographical changes\r\nhaving occurred between the deposition of the cretaceous system, or\r\nuppermost of the secondary series, and that of the oldest tertiary\r\ngroup, and still more between the era of the latter and that of the\r\nnewer tertiary formations. This change in the physical geography of\r\nEurope and North America was accompanied by an alteration no less\r\nremarkable in organic life, scarcely any _species_ being common both to\r\nthe secondary and tertiary rocks, and the fossils of the latter\r\naffording evidence of a different climate.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when we compare the tertiary formations of successive\r\nages, we trace a gradual approximation in the imbedded fossils, from an\r\nassemblage in which extinct species predominate, to one where the\r\nspecies agree for the most part with those now existing. In other words,\r\nwe find a gradual increase of animals and plants fitted for our present\r\nclimates, in proportion as the strata which we examine are more modern.\r\nNow, during all these successive tertiary periods, there are signs of a\r\ngreat increase of land in European and North American latitudes. By\r\nreference to the map (Pl. 1), and its description, p. 121, the reader\r\nwill see that about two-thirds of the present European lands have\r\nemerged since the earliest tertiary group originated. Nor is this the\r\nonly revolution which the same region has undergone within the period\r\nalluded to, some tracts which were previously land having gained in\r\naltitude, others, on the contrary, having sunk below their former level.\r\n\r\nThat the existing lands were not all upheaved at once into their present\r\nposition is proved by the most striking evidence. Several Italian\r\ngeologists, even before the time of Brocchi, had justly inferred that\r\nthe Apennines were elevated several thousand feet above the level of the\r\nMediterranean before the deposition of the modern Subapennine beds which\r\nflank them on either side. What now constitutes the central calcareous\r\nchain of the Apennines must for a long time have been a narrow ridgy\r\npeninsula, branching off, at its northern extremity, from the Alps near\r\nSavona. This peninsula has since been raised from one to two thousand\r\nfeet, by which movement the ancient shores, and, for a certain extent,\r\nthe bed of the contiguous sea, have been laid dry, both on the side of\r\nthe Mediterranean and the Adriatic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nThe nature of these vicissitudes will be explained by the accompanying\r\ndiagram, which represents a transverse section across the Italian\r\npeninsula. The inclined strata A are the disturbed formations of the\r\nApennines, into which the ancient igneous rocks a are supposed to have\r\nintruded themselves. At a lower level on each flank of the chain are the\r\nmore recent shelly beds _b b_, which often contain rounded pebbles\r\nderived from the waste of contiguous parts of the older Apennine\r\nlimestone. These, it will be seen, are horizontal, and lie in what is\r\ntermed \"unconformable stratification\" on the more ancient series. They\r\nnow constitute a line of hills of moderate elevation between the sea and\r\nthe Apennines, but never penetrate to the higher and more ancient\r\nvalleys of that chain.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomena are exhibited in the Alps on a much grander scale;\r\nthose mountains being composed in some even of their higher regions of\r\nthe newer secondary and oldest tertiary formations, while they are\r\nencircled by a great zone of more modern tertiary rocks both on their\r\nsouthern flank towards the plains of the Po, and on the side of\r\nSwitzerland and Austria, and at their eastern termination towards Styria\r\nand Hungary.[198] This newer tertiary zone marks the position of former\r\nseas or gulfs, like the Adriatic, wherein masses of strata accumulated,\r\nsome single groups of which are not inferior in thickness to the most\r\nvoluminous of our secondary formations in England. Some even of these\r\nnewer groups have been raised to the height of three or four thousand\r\nfeet, and in proportion to their antiquity, they generally rise to\r\ngreater heights, the older of them forming interior zones nearest to the\r\ncentral ridges of the Alps. We have already ascertained that the Alps\r\ngained accessions to their height and width at several successive\r\nperiods, and that the last series of improvements occurred when the\r\nseas were inhabited by many existing species of animals.\r\n\r\nWe may imagine some future series of convulsions once more to heave up\r\nthis stupendous chain, together with the adjoining bed of the sea, so\r\nthat the mountains of Europe may rival the Andes in elevation; in which\r\ncase the deltas of the Po, Adige, and Brenta, now encroaching upon the\r\nAdriatic, might be uplifted so as to form another exterior belt of\r\nconsiderable height around the southeastern flank of the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe Pyrenees, also, have acquired their present altitude, which in Mont\r\nPerdu exceeds eleven thousand feet, since the deposition of the\r\nnummulitic or Eocene division of the tertiary series. Some of the\r\ntertiary strata at the base of the chain are raised to the height of\r\nonly a few hundred feet above the sea, and retain a horizontal position,\r\nwithout partaking in general in the disturbance to which the older\r\nseries has been subjected; so that the great barrier between France and\r\nSpain was almost entirely upheaved in the interval between the\r\ndeposition of certain groups of tertiary strata.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable break between the most modern of the known secondary\r\nrocks and the oldest tertiary, may be apparent only, and ascribable to\r\nthe present deficiency of our information. Already the marles and green\r\nsand of Heers near Tongres, in Belgium, observed by M. Dumont, and the\r\n\"pisolitic limestone\" of the neighborhood of Paris, both intermediate in\r\nage between the Maestricht chalk and the lower Eocene strata, begin to\r\nafford us signs of a passage from one state of things to another.\r\nNevertheless, it is far from impossible that the interval between the\r\nchalk and tertiary formations constituted an era in the earth's history,\r\nwhen the transition from one class of organic beings to another was,\r\ncomparatively speaking, rapid. For if the doctrines above explained in\r\nregard to vicissitudes of temperature are sound, it will follow that\r\nchanges of equal magnitude in the geographical features of the globe may\r\nat different periods produce very unequal effects on climate; and, so\r\nfar as the existence of certain animals and plants depends on climate,\r\nthe duration of species would be shortened or protracted, according to\r\nthe rate at which the change of temperature proceeded.\r\n\r\nFor even if we assume that the intensity of the subterranean disturbing\r\nforces is uniform and capable of producing nearly equal amounts of\r\nalteration on the surface of the planet, during equal periods of time,\r\nstill the rate of alteration in climate would be by no means uniform.\r\nLet us imagine the quantity of land between the equator and the tropic\r\nin one hemisphere to be to that in the other as thirteen to one, which,\r\nas before stated, represents the unequal proportion of the\r\nextra-tropical lands in the two hemispheres at present. (See figs. 3 and\r\n4, p. 110.) Then let the first geographical change consist in the\r\nshifting of this preponderance of land from one side of the line to the\r\nother; from the southern hemisphere, for example, to the northern. Now\r\nthis need not affect the general temperature of the earth. But if, at\r\nanother epoch, we suppose a continuance of the same agency to transfer\r\nan equal volume of land from the torrid zone to the temperate and arctic\r\nregions of the northern and southern hemispheres, or into one of them,\r\nthere might be so great a refrigeration of the mean temperature _in all\r\nlatitudes_, that scarcely any of the pre-existing races of animals would\r\nsurvive; and, unless it pleased the Author of Nature that the planet\r\nshould be uninhabited, new species, and probably of widely different\r\nforms, would then be substituted in the room of the extinct. We ought\r\nnot, therefore, to infer that equal periods of time are always attended\r\nby an equal amount of change in organic life, since a great fluctuation\r\nin the mean temperature of the earth, the most influential cause which\r\ncan be conceived in exterminating whole races of animals and plants,\r\nmust, in different epochs, require unequal portions of time for its\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\n[PLATE I. _Map showing the extent of surface in Europe which has at one\r\nperiod or another been covered by the sea since the commencement of the\r\ndeposition of the older or Eocene Tertiary strata._]\r\n\r\nThis map will enable the reader to perceive at a glance the great extent\r\nof change in the physical geography of Europe, which can be proved to\r\nhave taken place since some of the older tertiary strata began to be\r\ndeposited. The proofs of submergence, during some part or other of this\r\nperiod, in all the districts distinguished by ruled lines, are of a most\r\nunequivocal character; for the area thus described is now covered by\r\ndeposits containing the fossil remains of animals which could only have\r\nlived in salt water. The most ancient part of the period referred to\r\ncannot be deemed very remote, considered geologically; because the\r\ndeposits of the Paris and London basins, and many other districts\r\nbelonging to the older tertiary epoch, are newer than the greater part\r\nof the sedimentary rocks (those commonly called secondary and primary\r\nfossiliferous or paleozoic) of which the crust of the globe is composed.\r\nThe species, moreover, of marine testacea, of which the remains are\r\nfound in these older tertiary formations, are not entirely distinct from\r\nsuch as now live. Yet, notwithstanding the comparatively recent epoch to\r\nwhich this retrospect is carried, the variations in the distribution of\r\nland and sea depicted on the map form only a part of those which must\r\nhave taken place during the period under consideration. Some\r\napproximation has merely been made to an estimate of the amount of _sea\r\nconverted into land_ in parts of Europe best known to geologists; but we\r\ncannot determine how much land has become sea during the same period;\r\nand there may have been repeated interchanges of land and water in the\r\nsame places, changes of which no account is taken in the map, and\r\nrespecting the amount of which little accurate information can ever be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nI have extended the sea in some instances beyond the limits of the land\r\nnow covered by tertiary formations, and marine drift, because other\r\ngeological data have been obtained for inferring the submergence of\r\nthese tracts after the deposition of the Eocene strata had begun. Thus,\r\nfor example, there are good reasons for concluding that part of the\r\nchalk of England (the North and South Downs, for example, together with\r\nthe intervening secondary tracts) continued beneath the sea until the\r\noldest tertiary beds had begun to accumulate.\r\n\r\nA strait of the sea separating England and Wales has also been\r\nintroduced, on the evidence afforded by shells of existing species found\r\nin a deposit of gravel, sand, loam, and clay, called the northern drift,\r\nby Sir R. Murchison.[199] And Mr. Trimmer has discovered similar recent\r\nmarine shells on the northern coast of North Wales, and on Moel Tryfane,\r\nnear the Menai Straits, at the height of 1392 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea!\r\n\r\nSome raised sea-beaches, and drift containing marine shells, which I\r\nexamined in 1843, between Limerick and Dublin, and which have been\r\ntraced over other parts of Ireland by different geologists, have\r\nrequired an extension of the dark lines so as to divide that island into\r\nseveral. In improving this part of my map I have been especially\r\nindebted to the assistance of Mr. Oldham, who in 1843 announced to the\r\nBritish Association at Cork the fact that at the period when the drift\r\nor glacial beds were deposited, Ireland must have formed an archipelago\r\nsuch as is here depicted. A considerable part of Scotland might also\r\nhave been represented in a similar manner as under water when the drift\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\nA portion of Brittany is divided into islands, because it is known to be\r\ncovered with patches of marine tertiary strata chiefly miocene. When I\r\nexamined these in 1830 and 1843, I convinced myself that the sea must\r\nhave covered much larger areas than are now occupied by these small and\r\ndetached deposits. The former connection of the White Sea and the Gulf\r\nof Finland is proved by the fact that a multitude of huge erratic blocks\r\nextend over the intervening space, and a large portion of Norway,\r\nSweden, and Denmark, as well as Germany and Russia, are represented as\r\nsea, on the same evidence, strengthened by the actual occurrence of\r\nfossil sea-shells, of recent species, in the drift of various portions\r\nof those countries. The submergence of considerable areas under large\r\nbodies of fresh water, during the tertiary period, of which there are\r\nmany striking geological proofs in Auvergne, and elsewhere, has not been\r\nexpressed by ruled lines. They bear testimony to the former existence of\r\nneighboring lands, and a certain elevation of the areas where they occur\r\nabove the level of the ocean; they are therefore left blank, together\r\nwith all the space that cannot be demonstrated to have been part of the\r\nsea at some time or other, since the commencement of the Eocene epoch.\r\n\r\nIn compiling this map, which has been entirely recast since the first\r\nedition, I have availed myself of the latest geological maps of the\r\nBritish isles, and north of Europe; also of those published by the\r\ngovernment surveyors of France, MM. de Beaumont and Dufresnoy; the map\r\nof Germany and part of Europe, by Von Dechen, and that of Italy by M.\r\nTchihatchoff (Berlin, 1842). Lastly, Sir R. Murchison's important map of\r\nRussia, and the adjoining countries, has enabled me to mark out not only\r\na considerable area, previously little known, in which tertiary\r\nformations occur; but also a still wider expanse, over which the\r\nnorthern drift, and erratic blocks with occasional marine shells, are\r\ntraceable. The southern limits of these glacial deposits in Russia and\r\nGermany indicate the boundary, so far as we can now determine it, of the\r\nnorthern ocean, at a period immediately antecedent to that of the human\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nI was anxious, even in the title of this map, to guard the reader\r\nagainst the supposition that it was intended to represent the state of\r\nthe physical geography of part of Europe at any _one point of time_. The\r\ndifficulty, or rather the impossibility, of restoring the geography of\r\nthe globe as it may have existed at any former period, especially a\r\nremote one, consists in this, that we can only point out where part of\r\nthe sea has been turned into land, and are almost always unable to\r\ndetermine what land may have become sea. All maps, therefore, pretending\r\nto represent the geography of remote geological epochs must be ideal.\r\nThe map under consideration is not a restoration of a former state of\r\nthings, at any particular moment of time, but a synoptical view of a\r\ncertain amount of one kind of change (the conversion of sea into land)\r\nknown to have been brought about within a given period.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to remark that the vertical movements to which the land\r\nis subject in certain regions, occasion alternately the subsidence and\r\nthe uprising of the surface; and that, by such oscillations at\r\nsuccessive periods, a great area may have been entirely covered with\r\nmarine deposits, although the whole may never have been beneath the\r\nwaters at one time; nay, even though the relative proportion of land and\r\nsea may have continued unaltered throughout the whole period. I believe,\r\nhowever, that since the commencement of the tertiary period, the dry\r\nland in the northern hemisphere has been continually on the increase,\r\nboth because it is now greatly in excess beyond the average proportion\r\nwhich land generally bears to water on the globe, and because a\r\ncomparison of the secondary and tertiary strata affords indications, as\r\nI have already shown, of a passage from the condition of an ocean\r\ninterspersed with islands to that of a large continent.\r\n\r\nBut supposing it were possible to represent all the vicissitudes in the\r\ndistribution of land and sea that have occurred during the tertiary\r\nperiod, and to exhibit not only the actual existence of land where there\r\nwas once sea, but also the extent of surface now submerged which may\r\nonce have been land, the map would still fail to express all the\r\nimportant revolutions in physical geography which have taken place\r\nwithin the epoch under consideration. For the oscillations of level, as\r\nwas before stated, have not merely been such as to lift up the land from\r\nbelow the water, but in some cases to occasion a rise of many thousand\r\nfeet above the sea. Thus the Alps have acquired an additional altitude\r\nof 4000, and even in some places 10,000 feet; and the Apennines owe a\r\nconsiderable part of their present height to subterranean convulsions\r\nwhich have happened within the tertiary epoch.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some mountain chains may have been lowered during the\r\nsame series of ages, in an equal degree, and shoals may have been\r\nconverted into deep abysses.[200] Since this map was recast in 1847,\r\ngeologists have very generally come to the conclusion that the\r\nnummulitic limestone, together with the overlying fucoidal grit and\r\nshale, called \"Flysch,\" in the Alps, belongs to the older tertiary or\r\nEocene group. As these nummulitic rocks enter into the structure of some\r\nof the most lofty and disturbed parts of the Alps, Apennines,\r\nCarpathians, Pyrenees, and other mountain chains, and form many of the\r\nelevated lands of Africa and Asia, their position almost implies the\r\nubiquity of the post-Eocene ocean, not, indeed, by the simultaneous, but\r\nby the successive, occupancy of the whole ground by its waters.[201]\r\n\r\n_Concluding remarks on changes in physical geography._--The foregoing\r\nobservations, it may be said, are confined chiefly to Europe, and\r\ntherefore merely establish the increase of dry land in a space which\r\nconstitutes but a small portion of the northern hemisphere; but it was\r\nstated in the preceding chapter, that the great Lowland of Siberia,\r\nlying chiefly between the latitudes 55 degrees and 75 degrees N. (an\r\narea nearly equal to all Europe), is covered for the most part by marine\r\nstrata, which, from the account given by Pallas, and more recently by\r\nSir R. Murchison, belongs to a period when all or nearly all the shells\r\nwere of a species still living in the north. The emergence, therefore,\r\nof this area from the deep is, comparatively speaking, a very modern\r\nevent, and must, as before remarked, have caused a great increase of\r\ncold throughout the globe.\r\n\r\nUpon a review, then, of all the facts above enumerated, respecting the\r\nancient geography of the globe as attested by geological monuments,\r\nthere appear good grounds for inferring that changes of climate\r\ncoincided with remarkable revolutions in the former position of sea and\r\nland. A wide expanse of ocean, interspersed with islands, seems to have\r\npervaded the northern hemisphere at the periods when the Silurian and\r\ncarboniferous rocks were formed, and a warm and very uniform temperature\r\nthen prevailed. Subsequent modifications in climate accompanied the\r\ndeposition of the secondary formations, when repeated changes were\r\neffected in the physical geography of our northern latitudes. Lastly,\r\nthe refrigeration became most decided, and the climate most nearly\r\nassimilated to that now enjoyed, when the lands in Europe and northern\r\nAsia had attained their full extension, and the mountain chains their\r\nactual height.\r\n\r\nSoon after the first publication of this theory of climate, an objection\r\nwas made by an anonymous German critic in 1833 that there are no\r\ngeological proofs of the prevalence at any former period of a\r\ntemperature _lower_ than that now enjoyed; whereas, if the causes above\r\nassigned were the true ones, it might reasonably have been expected that\r\nfossil remains would sometimes indicate colder as well as hotter\r\nclimates than those now established.[202] In answer to this objection, I\r\nmay suggest, that our present climates are probably far more distant\r\nfrom the extreme of possible heat than from its opposite extreme of\r\ncold. A glance at the map (fig. 6, p. 111) will show that all the\r\nexisting lands might be placed between the 30th parallels of latitude on\r\neach side of the equator, and that even then they would by no means fill\r\nthat space. In no other position would they give rise to so high a\r\ntemperature. But the present geographical condition of the earth is so\r\nfar removed from such a state of things, that the land lying between the\r\npoles and the parallels of 30, is in great excess; so much so that,\r\ninstead of being to the sea in the proportion of 1 to 3, which is as\r\nnear as possible the average general ratio throughout the globe, it is 9\r\nto 23.[203] Hence it ought not to surprise us if, in our geological\r\nretrospect, embracing perhaps a small part only of a complete cycle of\r\nchange in the terrestrial climates, we should happen to discover\r\neverywhere the signs of a higher temperature. The strata hitherto\r\nexamined may have originated when the quantity of equatorial land was\r\nalways decreasing and the land in regions nearer the poles augmenting in\r\nheight and area, until at length it attained its present excess in high\r\nlatitudes. There is nothing improbable in supposing that the\r\ngeographical revolutions of which we have hitherto obtained proofs had\r\nthis general tendency; and in that case the refrigeration must have been\r\nconstant, although, for reasons before explained, the rate of cooling\r\nmay not have been uniform.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be as well to recall the reader's attention to what was\r\nbefore said of the indication brought to light of late years, of a\r\nconsiderable oscillation of temperature, in the period immediately\r\npreceding the human era. We have seen that on examining some of the most\r\nnorthern deposits, those commonly called the northern drift in Scotland,\r\nIreland, and Canada, in which nearly all, in some cases, perhaps all,\r\nthe fossil shells are of recent species, we discover the signs of a\r\nclimate colder than that now prevailing in corresponding latitudes on\r\nboth sides the Atlantic. It appears that an arctic fauna specifically\r\nresembling that of the present seas, extended farther to the south than\r\nnow. This opinion is derived partly from the known habitations of the\r\ncorresponding living species, and partly from the abundance of certain\r\ngenera of shells and the absence of others.[204] The date of the\r\nrefrigeration thus inferred appears to coincide very nearly with the era\r\nof the dispersion of erratic blocks over Europe and North America, a\r\nphenomenon which will be ascribed in the sequel (ch. 16) to the cold\r\nthen prevailing in the northern hemisphere. The force, moreover, of the\r\nGerman critic's objection has been since in a great measure destroyed,\r\nby the larger and more profound knowledge acquired in the last few years\r\nof the ancient carboniferous flora, which has led the ablest botanists\r\nto adopt the opinion, that the climate of the coal period was remarkable\r\nfor its warmth, moisture, equability, and freedom from cold, rather than\r\nthe intensity of its _tropical heat_. We are therefore no longer\r\nentitled to assume that there has been a constant and gradual decline in\r\nthe absolute amount of heat formerly contained in the atmosphere and\r\nwaters of the ocean, such as it was conjectured might have emanated from\r\nthe incandescent central nucleus of a new and nearly fluid planet,\r\nbefore the interior had lost, by radiation into surrounding space, a\r\ngreat part of its original high temperature.\r\n\r\n_Astronomical causes of fluctuations in climate._--Sir John Herschel has\r\nlately inquired, whether there are any astronomical causes which may\r\noffer a possible explanation of the difference between the actual\r\nclimate of the earth's surface, and those which formerly appear to have\r\nprevailed. He has entered upon this subject, he says, \"impressed with\r\nthe magnificence of that view of geological revolutions, which regards\r\nthem rather as regular and necessary effects of great and general\r\ncauses, than as resulting from a series of convulsions and catastrophes,\r\nregulated by no laws, and reducible to no fixed principles.\" Geometers,\r\nhe adds, have demonstrated the absolute invariability of the mean\r\ndistance of the earth from the sun; whence it would at first seem to\r\nfollow, that the mean annual supply of light and heat derived from that\r\nluminary would be alike invariable: but a closer consideration of the\r\nsubject will show, that this would not be a legitimate conclusion; but\r\nthat on the contrary, the _mean_ amount of solar radiation is dependent\r\non the eccentricity of the earth's orbit, and therefore liable to\r\nvariation.[205]\r\n\r\nNow the eccentricity of the orbit, he continues, is actually\r\ndiminishing, and has been so for ages beyond the records of history. In\r\nconsequence, the ellipse is in a state of approach to a circle, and the\r\nannual average of solar heat radiated to the earth is actually on the\r\n_decrease_. So far this is in accordance with geological evidence, which\r\nindicates a general refrigeration of climate; but the question remains,\r\nwhether the amount of diminution which the eccentricity may have ever\r\nundergone can be supposed sufficient to account for any sensible\r\nrefrigeration. The calculations necessary to determine this point,\r\nthough practicable, have never yet been made, and would be extremely\r\nlaborious; for they must embrace all the perturbations which the most\r\ninfluential planets, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, would cause in\r\nthe earth's orbit, and in each other's movements round the sun.\r\n\r\nThe problem is also very complicated, inasmuch as it depends not merely\r\non the ellipticity of the earth's orbit, but on the assumed temperature\r\nof the celestial spaces beyond the earth's atmosphere; a matter still\r\nopen to discussion, and on which M. Fourier and Sir J. Herschel have\r\narrived at very different opinions. But if, says Herschel, we suppose an\r\nextreme case, as if the earth's orbit should ever become as eccentric as\r\nthat of the planet Juno or Pallas, a great change of climate might be\r\nconceived to result, the winter and summer temperatures being sometimes\r\nmitigated, and at others exaggerated, in the same latitudes.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be desired that the calculations alluded to were executed,\r\nas even if they should demonstrate, as M. Arago thinks highly\r\nprobable,[206] that the mean amount of solar radiation can never be\r\nmaterially affected by irregularities in the earth's motion, it would\r\nstill be satisfactory to ascertain the point. Such inquiries, however,\r\ncan never supersede the necessity of investigating the consequences of\r\nthe varying position of continents, shifted as we know them to have been\r\nduring successive epochs, from one part of the globe to the other.\r\n\r\nAnother astronomical hypothesis respecting the possible cause of secular\r\nvariations in climate, has been proposed by a distinguished\r\nmathematician and philosopher, M. Poisson. He begins by assuming, 1st,\r\nthat the sun and our planetary system are not stationary, but carried\r\nonward by a common movement through space; 2dly, that every point in\r\nspace receives heat as well as light from innumerable stars surrounding\r\nit on all sides, so that if a right line of indefinite length be\r\nproduced in any direction from such a point, it must encounter a star\r\neither visible or invisible to us. 3dly, He then goes on to assume, that\r\nthe different regions of space, which in the course of millions of years\r\nare traversed by our system, must be of very unequal temperature,\r\ninasmuch as some of them must receive a greater, others a less, quantity\r\nof radiant heat from the great stellary inclosure. If the earth, he\r\ncontinues, or any other large body, pass from a hotter to a colder\r\nregion, it would not readily lose in the second all the heat which it\r\nhas imbibed in the first region, but retain a temperature increasing\r\ndownwards from the surface, as in the actual condition of our\r\nplanet.[207]\r\n\r\nNow the opinion originally suggested by Sir W. Herschel, that our sun\r\nand its attendant planets were all moving onward through space, in the\r\ndirection of the constellation Hercules, is very generally thought by\r\neminent astronomers to be confirmed. But even if its reality be no\r\nlonger matter of doubt, conjectures as to its amount are still vague and\r\nuncertain; and great, indeed, must be the extent of the movement before\r\nthis cause alone can work any material alteration in the terrestrial\r\nclimates. Mr. Hopkins, when treating of this theory, remarked, that so\r\nfar as we were acquainted with the position of the stars not very remote\r\nfrom the sun, they seem to be so distant from each other, that there are\r\nno points in space among them, where the intensity of radiating heat\r\nwould be comparable to that which the earth derives from the sun, except\r\nat points very near to each star. Thus, in order that the earth should\r\nderive a degree of heat from stellar radiation comparable to that now\r\nderived from the sun, she must be in close proximity to some particular\r\nstar, leaving the aggregate effect of radiation from the other stars\r\nnearly the same as at present. This approximation, however, to a single\r\nstar could not take place consistently with the preservation of the\r\nmotion of the earth about the sun, according to its present laws.\r\n\r\nSuppose our sun should approach a star within the present distance of\r\nNeptune. That planet could no longer remain a member of the solar\r\nsystem, and the motions of the other planets would be disturbed in a\r\ndegree which no one has ever contemplated as probable since the\r\nexistence of the solar system. But such a star, supposing it to be no\r\nlarger than the sun, and to emit the same quantity of heat, would not\r\nsend to the earth much more than one-thousandth part of the heat which\r\nshe derives from the sun, and would therefore produce only a very small\r\nchange in terrestrial temperature.[208]\r\n\r\n_Variable splendor of stars._--There is still another astronomical\r\nsuggestion respecting the possible causes of secular variations in the\r\nterrestrial climates which deserves notice. It has long been known that\r\ncertain stars are liable to great and periodical fluctuations in\r\nsplendor, and Sir J. Herschel has lately ascertained (Jan. 1840), that a\r\nlarge and brilliant star, called _alpha_ Orionis, sustained, in the\r\ncourse of six weeks, a loss of nearly half its light. \"This phenomenon,\"\r\nhe remarks, \"cannot fail to awaken attention, and revive those\r\nspeculations which were first put forth by my father Sir W. Herschel,\r\nrespecting the possibility of a change in the lustre of _our sun\r\nitself_. If there really be a community of nature between the sun and\r\nfixed stars, every proof that we obtain of the extensive prevalence of\r\nsuch periodical changes in those remote bodies, adds to the probability\r\nof finding something of the kind nearer home.\" Referring then to the\r\npossible bearing of such facts on ancient revolutions, in terrestrial\r\nclimates, he says, that \"it is a matter of observed fact, that many\r\nstars _have_ undergone, in past ages, within the records of astronomical\r\nhistory, very extensive changes in apparent lustre, without a change of\r\ndistance adequate to producing such an effect. If our sun were even\r\n_intrinsically_ much brighter than at present, the mean temperature of\r\nthe surface of our globe would, of course, be proportionally greater. I\r\nspeak now not of periodical, but of secular changes. But the argument\r\nis complicated with the consideration of the possibly imperfect\r\ntransparency of the celestial spaces, and with the cause of that\r\nimperfect transparency, which may be due to material non-luminous\r\nparticles diffused irregularly in patches analogous to nebulae, but of\r\ngreater extent--to _cosmical clouds_, in short--of whose existence we\r\nhave, I think, some indication in the singular and apparently capricious\r\nphenomena of temporary stars, and perhaps in the recent extraordinary\r\nsudden increase and hardly less sudden diminution of [Greek: e]\r\n_Argus_.\"[209]\r\n\r\nMore recently (1852) Schwabe has observed that the spots on the sun\r\nalternately increase and decrease in the course of every ten years, and\r\nCaptain Sabine has pointed out that this variable obscuration coincides\r\nin time both as to its maximum and minimum with changes in all those\r\nterrestrial magnetic variations which are caused by the sun. Hence he\r\ninfers that the period of alteration in the spots is a _solar magnetic\r\nperiod_. Assuming such to be the case, the variable light of some stars\r\nmay indicate a similar phenomenon, or they may be stellar magnetic\r\nperiods, differing only in the degree of obscuration and its duration.\r\nAnd as hitherto we have perceived no fluctuation in the heat received by\r\nthe earth from the sun coincident with the _solar magnetic period_, so\r\nthe fluctuations in the brilliancy of the stars may not perhaps be\r\nattended with any perceptible alteration in their power of radiating\r\nheat. But before we can speculate with advantage in this new and\r\ninteresting field of inquiry, we require more facts and observations.\r\n\r\n_Supposed gradual diminution of the earth's primitive heat._--The\r\ngradual diminution of the supposed primitive heat of the globe has been\r\nresorted to by many geologists as the principal cause of alterations of\r\nclimate. The matter of our planet is imagined, in accordance with the\r\nconjectures of Leibnitz, to have been originally in an intensely heated\r\nstate, and to have been parting ever since with portions of its heat,\r\nand at the same time contracting its dimensions. There are, undoubtedly,\r\ngood grounds for inferring from recent observation and experiment, that\r\nthe temperature of the earth increases as we descend from the surface to\r\nthat slight depth to which man can penetrate: but there are no positive\r\nproofs of a secular decrease of internal heat accompanied by\r\ncontraction. On the contrary, La Place has shown, by reference to\r\nastronomical observations made in the time of Hipparchus, that in the\r\nlast two thousand years at least there has been no sensible contraction\r\nof the globe by cooling; for had this been the case, even to an\r\nextremely small amount, the day would have been shortened, whereas its\r\nlength has certainly not diminished during that period by 1/300th of a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nBaron Fourier, after making a curious series of experiments on the\r\ncooling of incandescent bodies, considers it to be proved\r\nmathematically, that the actual distribution of heat in the earth's\r\nenvelope is precisely that which would have taken place if the globe\r\nhad been formed in a medium of a very high temperature, and had\r\nafterwards been constantly cooled.[210] He contends, that although no\r\ncontraction can be demonstrated to have taken place within the\r\nhistorical period (the operation being slow and the time of observation\r\nlimited), yet it is no less certain that heat is annually passing out by\r\nradiation from the interior of the globe into the planetary spaces. He\r\neven undertook to demonstrate that the quantity of heat thus transmitted\r\ninto space in the course of every century, through every square metre of\r\nthe earth's surface, would suffice to melt a column of ice having a\r\nsquare metre for its base, and being three metres (or 9 feet 10 inches)\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nIt is at the same time denied, that there is any assignable mode in\r\nwhich the heat thus lost by radiation can be again restored to the\r\nearth, and consequently the interior of our planet must, from the moment\r\nof its creation, have been subject to refrigeration, and is destined\r\ntogether with the sun and stars forever to grow colder. But I shall\r\npoint out in the sequel (chapter 31) many objections to these views, and\r\nto the theory of the intense heat of the earth's central nucleus, and\r\nshall then inquire how far the observed augmentation of temperature, as\r\nwe descend below the surface, may be referable to other causes\r\nunconnected with the supposed pristine fluidity of the entire globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF THE PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF ORGANIC LIFE AT SUCCESSIVE\r\nGEOLOGICAL PERIODS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Theory of the progressive development of organic life--Evidence in\r\n    its support inconclusive--Vertebrated animals, and plants of the\r\n    most perfect organization, in strata of very high\r\n    antiquity--Differences between the organic remains of successive\r\n    formations--Comparative modern origin of the human race--The popular\r\n    doctrine of successive development not established by the admission\r\n    that man is of modern origin--Introduction of man, to what extent a\r\n    change in the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Progressive development of organic life._--In the preceding chapters I\r\nhave considered whether revolutions in the general climate of the globe\r\nafford any just ground of opposition to the doctrine that the former\r\nchanges of the earth which are treated of in geology belong to one\r\nuninterrupted series of physical events governed by ordinary causes.\r\nAgainst this doctrine some popular arguments have been derived from the\r\ngreat vicissitudes of the organic creation in times past; I shall\r\ntherefore proceed to the discussion of such objections, which have been\r\nthus formally advanced by the late Sir Humphrey Davy. \"It is\r\nimpossible,\" he affirms, \"to defend the proposition, that the present\r\norder of things is the ancient and constant order of nature, only\r\nmodified by existing laws: in those strata which are deepest, and which\r\nmust, consequently, be supposed to be the earliest deposited, forms even\r\nof vegetable life are rare; shells and vegetable remains are found in\r\nthe next order; the bones of fishes and oviparous reptiles exist in the\r\nfollowing class; the remains of birds, with those of the same genera\r\nmentioned before, in the next order; those of quadrupeds of extinct\r\nspecies in a still more recent class; and it is only in the loose and\r\nslightly consolidated strata of gravel and sand, and which are usually\r\ncalled diluvian formations, that the remains of animals such as now\r\npeople the globe are found, with others belonging to extinct species.\r\nBut, in none of these formations, whether called secondary, tertiary, or\r\ndiluvial, have the remains of man, or any of his works, been discovered;\r\nand whoever dwells upon this subject must be convinced, that the present\r\norder of things, and the comparatively recent existence of man as the\r\nmaster of the globe, is as certain as the destruction of a former and a\r\ndifferent order, and the extinction of a number of living forms which\r\nhave no types in being. In the oldest secondary strata there are no\r\nremains of such animals as now belong to the surface; and in the rocks,\r\nwhich may be regarded as more recently deposited, these remains occur\r\nbut rarely, and with abundance of extinct species;--there seems, as it\r\nwere, a gradual approach to the present system of things, and a\r\nsuccession of destructions and creations preparatory to the existence of\r\nman.\"[211]\r\n\r\nIn the above passages, the author deduces two important conclusions from\r\ngeological data: first, that in the successive groups of strata, from\r\nthe oldest to the most recent, there is a progressive development of\r\norganic life, from the simplest to the most complicated\r\nforms;--secondly, that man is of comparatively recent origin, and these\r\nconclusions he regards as inconsistent with the doctrine, \"that the\r\npresent order of things is the ancient and constant order of nature only\r\nmodified by existing laws.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect, then, to the first of these propositions, we may ask\r\nwhether the theory of the progressive development of animal and\r\nvegetable life, and their successive advancement from a simple to a more\r\nperfect state, has any secure foundation in fact? No geologists who are\r\nin possession of all the data now established respecting fossil remains,\r\nwill for a moment contend for the doctrine in all its detail, as laid\r\ndown by the distinguished philosopher to whose opinions we have\r\nreferred: but naturalists, who are not unacquainted with recent\r\ndiscoveries, continue to defend it in a modified form. They say that in\r\nthe first period of the world (by which they mean the earliest of which\r\nwe have yet brought to light any memorials), the vegetation was\r\ncharacterized by a predominance of cryptogamic plants, while the animals\r\nwhich coexisted were almost entirely confined to zoophytes, testacea,\r\nand a few fish. Plants of a less simple structure, coniferae and cycadeae,\r\nflourished largely in the next epoch, when oviparous reptiles began also\r\nto abound. Lastly, the terrestrial flora became most diversified and\r\nmost perfect when the highest orders of animals, the mammalia and birds,\r\nwere called into existence.\r\n\r\nNow in the first place, it may be observed, that many naturalists are\r\nguilty of no small inconsistency in endeavoring to connect the phenomena\r\nof the earliest vegetation with a nascent condition of organic life, and\r\nat the same time to deduce from the numerical predominance of certain\r\nforms, the greater heat or uniformity of the ancient climate. The\r\narguments in favor of the latter conclusion are without any force,\r\nunless we can assume that the rules followed by the Author of Nature in\r\nthe creation and distribution of organic beings were the same formerly\r\nas now; and that, as certain families of animals and plants are now most\r\nabundant in, or exclusively confined to regions where there is a certain\r\ntemperature, a certain degree of humidity, a certain intensity of light,\r\nand other conditions, so also analogous phenomena were exhibited at\r\nevery former era.\r\n\r\nIf this postulate be denied, and the prevalence of particular families\r\nbe declared to depend on a certain order of precedence in the\r\nintroduction of different classes into the earth, and if it be\r\nmaintained that the standard of organization was raised successively, we\r\nmust then ascribe the numerical preponderance, in the earlier ages, of\r\nplants of simpler structure, _not to the heat_, or other climatal\r\nconditions, but to those different laws which regulate organic life in\r\nnewly created worlds.\r\n\r\nBefore we can infer a warm and uniform temperature in high latitudes,\r\nfrom the presence of 250 species of ferns, some of them arborescent,\r\naccompanied by lycopadiacae of large size, and araucariae, we must be\r\npermitted to assume, that at all times, past, present, and future, a\r\nheated and moist atmosphere pervading the northern hemisphere has a\r\ntendency to produce in the vegetation a predominance of analogous forms.\r\n\r\nIt should moreover be borne in mind, when we are considering the\r\nquestion of development from a botanical point of view, that naturalists\r\nare by no means agreed as to the existence of an ascending scale of\r\norganization in the vegetable world corresponding to that which is very\r\ngenerally recognized in animals. \"From the sponge to man,\" in the\r\nlanguage of De Blainville, there may be a progressive chain of being,\r\nalthough often broken and imperfect; but if we seek to classify plants\r\naccording to a linear arrangement, ascending gradually from the lichen\r\nto the lily or the rose, we encounter incomparably greater difficulties.\r\nYet the doctrine of a more highly developed organization in the plants\r\ncreated at successive periods presupposes the admission of such a\r\ngraduated scale.\r\n\r\nWe have as yet obtained but scanty information respecting the state of\r\nthe terrestrial flora at periods antecedent to the coal. In the\r\ncarboniferous epoch, about 500 species of fossil plants are enumerated\r\nby Adolphe Brongniart, which we may safely regard as a mere fragment of\r\nan ancient flora; since, in Europe alone, there are now no less than\r\n11,000 living species. I have already hinted that the plants which\r\nproduced coal were not drifted from a distance, but that nearly all of\r\nthem grew on the spots where they became fossil. They appear to have\r\nbelonged, as before explained (p. 115), to a peculiar class of\r\n_stations_,--to low level and swampy regions, in the deltas of large\r\nrivers, slightly elevated above the level of the sea. From the study,\r\ntherefore, of such a vegetation, we can derive but little insight into\r\nthe nature of the contemporaneous upland flora, still less of the plants\r\nof the mountainous or Alpine country; and if so, we are enabled to\r\naccount for the apparent monotony of the vegetation, although its\r\nuniform character was doubtless in part owing to a greater uniformity of\r\nclimate then prevailing throughout the globe. Some of the commonest\r\ntrees of this period, such as the sigillariae, which united the structure\r\nof ferns and of cycadeae, departed very widely from all known living\r\ntypes. The coniferae and ferns, on the contrary, were very closely allied\r\nto living genera. It is remarkable that none of the exogens of Lindley\r\n(dicotyledonous angiosperms of Brongniart), which comprise four-fifths\r\nof the living flora of the globe, and include all the forest trees of\r\nEurope except the fir-tribe, have yet been discovered in the coal\r\nmeasures, and a very small number--fifteen species only--of\r\nmonocotyledons. If several of these last are true plants, an opinion to\r\nwhich Messrs. Lindley, Unger, Corda, and other botanists of note\r\nincline, the question whether any of the most highly organized plants\r\nare to be met with in ancient strata is at once answered in the\r\naffirmative. But the determination of these palms being doubtful, we\r\nhave as yet in the coal no positive proofs either of the existence of\r\nthe most perfect, or of the most simple forms of flowering or flowerless\r\nvegetation. We have no fungi, lichens, hepatici or mosses: yet this\r\nlatter class may have been as fully represented then as now.\r\n\r\nIn the flora of the secondary eras, all botanists agree that palms\r\nexisted, although in Europe plants of the family of zamia and cycas\r\ntogether with coniferae predominated, and must have given a peculiar\r\naspect to the flora. As only 200 or 300 species of plants are known in\r\nall the rocks ranging from the Trias to the Oolite inclusive, our data\r\nare too scanty as yet to affirm whether the vegetation of this second\r\nepoch was or was not on the whole of a simpler organization than that of\r\nour own times.\r\n\r\nIn the Lower Cretaceous formation, near Aix-la-Chapelle, the leaves of a\r\ngreat many dicotyledonous trees have lately been discovered by Dr.\r\nDebey, establishing the important fact of the coexistence of a large\r\nnumber of angiosperms with cycadeae, and with that rich reptilian fauna\r\ncomprising the ichthyosaur, plesiosaur, and pterodactyl, which some had\r\nsupposed to indicate a state of the atmosphere unfavorable to a\r\ndicotyledonous vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe number of plants hitherto obtained from _tertiary_ strata of\r\ndifferent ages is very limited, but is rapidly increasing. They are\r\nreferable to a much greater variety of families and classes than an\r\nequal number of fossil species taken from secondary or primary rocks,\r\nthe angiosperms bearing the same proportion to the gymnosperms and\r\nacrogens as in the present flora of the globe. This greater variety may,\r\ndoubtless, be partly ascribed to the greater diversity of stations in\r\nwhich the plants grew, as we have in this case an opportunity, rarely\r\nenjoyed in studying the secondary fossils, of investigating inland or\r\nlacustrine deposits accumulated at different heights above the sea, and\r\ncontaining the memorials of plants washed down from adjoining mountains.\r\n\r\nIn regard, then, to the strata from the cretaceous to the uppermost\r\ntertiary inclusive, we may affirm that we find in them all the principal\r\nclasses of living plants, and during this vast lapse of time four or\r\nfive complete changes in the vegetation occurred, yet no step whatever\r\nwas made in advance at any of these periods by the addition of more\r\nhighly organized species.\r\n\r\nIf we next turn to the fossils of the animal kingdom, we may inquire\r\nwhether, when they are arranged by the geologists in a chronological\r\nseries, they imply that beings of more highly developed structure and\r\ngreater intelligence entered upon the earth at successive epochs, those\r\nof the simplest organization being the first created, and those more\r\nhighly organized being the last.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the Silurian fauna is at present derived entirely from\r\nrocks of marine origin, no fresh-water strata of such high antiquity\r\nhaving yet been met with. The fossils, however, of these ancient rocks\r\nat once reduce the theory of progressive development to within very\r\nnarrow limits, for already they comprise a very full representation of\r\nthe radiata, mollusca, and articulata proper to the sea. Thus, in the\r\ngreat division of radiata, we find asteriod and helianthoid zoophytes,\r\nbesides crinoid and cystidean echinoderms. In the mollusca, between 200\r\nand 300 species of cephalopoda are enumerated. In the articulata we have\r\nthe crustaceans represented by more than 200 species of trilobites,\r\nbesides other genera of the same class. The remains of fish are as yet\r\nconfined to the upper part of the Silurian series; but some of these\r\nbelong to placoid fish, which occupy a high grade in the scale of\r\norganization. Some naturalists have assumed that the earliest fauna was\r\nexclusively marine, because we have not yet found a single Silurian\r\nhelix, insect, bird, terrestrial reptile or mammifer; but when we carry\r\nback our investigation to a period so remote from the present, we ought\r\nnot to be surprised if the only accessible strata should be limited to\r\ndeposits formed far from land, because the ocean probably occupied then,\r\nas now, the greater part of the earth's surface. After so many entire\r\ngeographical revolutions, the chances are nearly three to one in favor\r\nof our finding that such small portions of the existing continents and\r\nislands as expose Silurian strata to view, should coincide in position\r\nwith the ancient ocean rather than the land. We must not, therefore,\r\ntoo hastily infer, from the absence of fossil bones of mammalia in the\r\nolder rocks, that the highest class of vertebrated animals did not exist\r\nin remoter ages. There are regions at present, in the Indian and Pacific\r\nOceans, coextensive in area with the continents of Europe and North\r\nAmerica, where we might dredge the bottom and draw up thousands of\r\nshells and corals, without obtaining one bone of a land quadruped.\r\nSuppose our mariners were to report, that, on sounding in the Indian\r\nOcean near some coral reefs, and at some distance from the land, they\r\ndrew up on hooks attached to their line portions of a leopard, elephant,\r\nor tapir, should we not be skeptical as to the accuracy of their\r\nstatements? and if we had no doubt of their veracity, might we not\r\nsuspect them to be unskilful naturalists? or, if the fact were\r\nunquestioned, should we not be disposed to believe that some vessel had\r\nbeen wrecked on the spot?\r\n\r\nThe casualties must always be rare by which land quadrupeds are swept by\r\nrivers far out into the open sea, and still rarer the contingency of\r\nsuch a floating body not being devoured by sharks or other predaceous\r\nfish, such as were those of which we find the teeth preserved in some of\r\nthe carboniferous strata. But if the carcass should escape, and should\r\nhappen to sink where sediment was in the act of accumulating, and if the\r\nnumerous causes of subsequent disintegration should not efface all\r\ntraces of the body, included for countless ages in solid rock, is it not\r\ncontrary to all calculation of chances that we should hit upon the exact\r\nspot--that mere point in the bed of an ancient ocean, where the precious\r\nrelic was entombed? Can we expect for a moment, when we have only\r\nsucceeded, amidst several thousand fragments of corals and shells, in\r\nfinding a few bones of _aquatic_ or _amphibious_ animals, that we should\r\nmeet with a single skeleton of an inhabitant of the land?\r\n\r\nClarence, in his dream, saw, \"in the slimy bottom of the deep,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    ----a thousand fearful wrecks;\r\n  A thousand men, that fishes gnaw'd upon:\r\n  Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad he also beheld, amid \"the dead bones that lay scattered by,\" the\r\ncarcasses of lions, deer, and the other wild tenants of the forest and\r\nthe plain, the fiction would have been deemed unworthy of the genius of\r\nShakspeare. So daring a disregard of probability and violation of\r\nanalogy would have been condemned as unpardonable, even where the poet\r\nwas painting those incongruous images which present themselves to a\r\ndisturbed imagination during the visions of the night.\r\n\r\nUntil lately it was supposed that the old red sandstone, or Devonian\r\nrocks, contained no vertebrate remains except those of fish, but in 1850\r\nthe footprints of a chelonian, and in 1851 the skeleton of a reptile,\r\nallied both to the batrachians and lizards, were found in a sandstone of\r\nthat age near Elgin in Scotland.[212] Up to the year 1844 it was laid\r\ndown as a received dogma in many works of high authority in geology,\r\nthat reptiles were not created until after the close of the\r\ncarboniferous epoch. In the course of that year, however, Hermann Von\r\nMeyer announced the discovery, in the coal measures of Rhenish Bavaria,\r\nof a reptile, called by him Apateon, related to the salamanders; and in\r\n1847 three species of another genus, called archegosaurus by Goldfuss,\r\nwere obtained from the coal of Saarbruck, between Treves and Strasburg.\r\nThe footprints of a large quadruped, probably batrachian, had also been\r\nobserved by Dr. King in the carboniferous rocks of Pennsylvania in 1844.\r\nThe first example of the _bones_ of a reptile in the Coal of North\r\nAmerica was detected so lately as September, 1852, by Mr. G. W. Dawson\r\nand myself in Nova Scotia. These remains, referred by Messrs. Wyman and\r\nOwen to a perennibranchiate batrachian, were met with in the interior of\r\nan erect fossil tree, apparently a sigillaria. They seem clearly to have\r\nbeen introduced together with sediment into the tree, during its\r\nsubmergence and after it had decayed and was standing as a hollow\r\ncylinder of bark, this bark being now converted into coal.\r\n\r\nWhen Agassiz, in his great work on fossil fish, described 152 species of\r\nichthyolites from the Coal, he found them to consist of 94 placoids,\r\nbelonging to the families of shark and ray, and 58 ganoids. One family\r\nof the latter he called \"sauroid fish,\" including the megalicthys and\r\nholoptychius, often of great size, and all predaceous. Although true\r\nfish, and not intermediate between that class and reptiles, they seem to\r\nhave been more highly organized than any living fish, reminding us of\r\nthe skeletons of saurians by the close suture of their cranial bones,\r\ntheir large conical teeth, striated longitudinally, and the articulation\r\nof the spinous processes with the vertebrae. Among living species they\r\nare most nearly allied to the lepidosteus, or bony pike of the North\r\nAmerican rivers. Before the recent progress of discovery above alluded\r\nto had shown the fallacy of such ideas, it was imagined by some\r\ngeologists that this ichthyic type was the more highly developed,\r\nbecause it took the lead at the head of nature before the class of\r\nreptiles had been created. The confident assumption indulged in till the\r\nyear 1844, that reptiles were first introduced into the earth in the\r\nPermian period, shows the danger of taking for granted that the date of\r\nthe creation of any family of animals or plants in past time coincides\r\nwith the age of the oldest stratified rock in which the geologist has\r\ndetected its remains. Nevertheless, after repeated disappointments, we\r\nfind some naturalists as much disposed as ever to rely on such negative\r\nevidence, and to feel now as sure that reptiles were not introduced into\r\nthe earth till after the Silurian epoch, as they were in 1844, that they\r\nappeared for the first time at an era subsequent to the carboniferous.\r\n\r\nScanty as is the information hitherto obtained in regard to the\r\narticulata of the coal formation, we have at least ascertained that some\r\ninsects winged their way through the ancient forests. In the ironstone\r\nof Coalbrook Dale, two species of coleoptera of the Linnaean genus\r\ncurculio have been met with: and a neuropterous insect resembling a\r\ncorydalis, together with another of the same order related to the\r\nphasmidae. As an example of the insectivorous arachnidae, I may mention\r\nthe scorpion of the Bohemian coal, figured by Count Sternberg, in which\r\neven the eyes, skin, and minute hairs were preserved.[213] We need not\r\ndespair, therefore, of obtaining eventually fossil representatives of\r\nall the principal orders of hexapods and arachnidae in carboniferous\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nNext in chronological order above the Coal comes the allied Magnesian\r\nLimestone, or Permian group, and the secondary formations from the Trias\r\nto the Chalk inclusive. These rocks comprise the monuments of a long\r\nseries of ages in which reptiles of every variety of size, form, and\r\nstructure peopled the earth; so that the whole period, and especially\r\nthat of the Lias and Oolite, has been sometimes called \"the age of\r\nreptiles.\" As there are now mammalia entirely confined to the land;\r\nothers which, like the bat and vampire, fly in the air; others, again,\r\nof amphibious habits, frequenting rivers, like the hippopotamus, otter,\r\nand beaver; others exclusively aquatic and marine, like the seal, whale,\r\nand narwal; so in the early ages under consideration, there were\r\nterrestrial, winged, and aquatic reptiles. There were iguanodons walking\r\non the land, pterodactyls winging their way through the air, monitors\r\nand crocodiles in the rivers, and ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs in the\r\nocean. It appears also that some of these ancient saurians approximated\r\nmore nearly in their organization to the type of living mammalia than do\r\nany of the reptiles now existing.[214]\r\n\r\nIn the vast range of strata above alluded to, comprising the Permian,\r\nthe Upper New Red Sandstone and Muschelkalk, the Lias, Oolite, Wealden,\r\nGreen-sand, and Chalk, scarcely any well-authenticated instances of the\r\noccurrence of fossil birds in Europe are on record, and only two or\r\nthree of fossil mammalia.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the absence of birds, they are usually wanting, for reasons\r\nafterwards to be explained (see chap. 47), in deposits of all ages, even\r\nin the tertiary periods, where we know that birds as well as land\r\nquadrupeds abounded. Some at least of the fossil remains formerly\r\nreferred to this class in the Wealden (a great freshwater deposit below\r\nthe chalk), have been recently shown by Mr. Owen to belong to\r\npterodactyls.[215] But in North America still more ancient indications\r\nof the existence of the feathered tribe have been detected, the fossil\r\nfoot-marks of a great variety of species, of various sizes, some larger\r\nthan the ostrich, others smaller than the plover, having been observed.\r\nThese bipeds have left marks of their footsteps on strata of an age\r\ndecidedly intermediate between the Lias and the Coal.[216]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.\r\n\r\n_Natural Size_.\r\n\r\nThylacotherium Prevostii (_Valenciennes_).

In the former, the evidence is as yet limited to two\r\nsmall molar teeth, described by Professor Plieninger in 1847, under the\r\ngeneric name of Microlestes. They were found near Stuttgart, and\r\npossess the double fangs so characteristic of mammalia.[217] The other\r\nfossil remains of the same class were derived from one of the inferior\r\nmembers of the oolitic series in Oxfordshire, and afford more full and\r\nsatisfactory evidence, consisting of the lower jaws of three species of\r\nsmall quadrupeds about the size of a mole. Cuvier, when he saw one of\r\nthem (during a visit to Oxford in 1818), referred it to the marsupial\r\norder, stating, however, that it differed from all known carnivora in\r\nhaving ten molar teeth in a row. Professor Owen afterwards pointed out\r\nthat the jaw belonged to an extinct genus, having considerable affinity\r\nto a newly discovered Australian mammifer, the _Myrmecobius_ of\r\nWaterhouse, which has nine molar teeth in the lower jaw. (Fig. 9.) A\r\nmore perfect specimen enabled Mr. Owen in 1846 to prove that the\r\ninflection of the angular process of the lower jaw was not sufficiently\r\nmarked to entitle the osteologist to infer that this quadruped was\r\nmarsupial, as the process is not bent inwards in a greater degree than\r\nin the mole or hedgehog. Hence the genus amphitherium, of which there\r\nare two species from Stonesfield, must be referred to the ordinary or\r\nplacental type of insectivorous mammals, although it approximates in\r\nsome points of structure to the myrmecobius and allied marsupials of\r\nAustralia. The other contemporary genus, called phascolotherium, agrees\r\nmuch more nearly in osteological character and precisely in the number\r\nof the teeth with the opossums; and is believed to have been truly\r\nmarsupial. (Fig. 10.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.\r\n\r\n_Natural size._\r\n\r\nPhascolotherium Bucklandi, _Owen_. (_Syn._ Didelphis Bucklandi, _Brod._)\r\nLower jaw, from Stonesfield.[220]\r\n\r\n1. The jaw magnified twice in length. 2. The second molar tooth\r\nmagnified six times.]\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of these most ancient memorials of the mammiferous type,\r\nin so low a member of the oolitic series, while no other representatives\r\nof the same class (if we except the microlestes) have yet been found in\r\nany other of the inferior or superior secondary strata, is a striking\r\nfact, and should serve as a warning to us against hasty generalizations,\r\nfounded solely on negative evidence. So important an exception to a\r\ngeneral rule may be perfectly consistent with the conclusion, that a\r\nsmall number only of mammalia inhabited European latitudes when our\r\nsecondary rocks were formed; but it seems fatal to the theory of\r\nprogressive development, or to the notion that the order of precedence\r\nin the creation of animals, considered chronologically, has precisely\r\ncoincided with the order in which they would be ranked according to\r\nperfection or complexity of structure.\r\n\r\nIt was for many years suggested that the marsupial order to which the\r\nfossil animals of Stonesfield were supposed exclusively to belong\r\nconstitutes the lowest grade in the class Mammalia, and that this order,\r\nof which the brain is of more simple form, evinces an inferior degree of\r\nintelligence. If, therefore, in the oolitic period the marsupial tribes\r\nwere the only warm-blooded quadrupeds which had as yet appeared upon our\r\nplanet, the fact, it was said, confirmed the theory which teaches that\r\nthe creation of the more simple forms in each division of the animal\r\nkingdom preceded that of the more complex. But on how slender a support,\r\neven if the facts had continued to hold true, did such important\r\nconclusions hang! The Australian continent, so far as it has been\r\nhitherto explored, contains no indigenous quadrupeds save those of the\r\nmarsupial order, with the exception of a few small rodents, while some\r\nneighboring islands to the north, and even southern Africa, in the same\r\nlatitude as Australia, abound in mammalia of every tribe except the\r\nmarsupial. We are entirely unable to explain on what physiological or\r\nother laws this singular diversity in the habitations of living mammalia\r\ndepends; but nothing is more clear than that the causes which stamp so\r\npeculiar a character on two different provinces of wide extent are\r\nwholly independent of time, or of the age or maturity of the planet.\r\n\r\nThe strata of the Wealden, although of a later date than the oolite of\r\nStonesfield, and although filled with the remains of large reptiles,\r\nboth terrestrial and aquatic, have not yielded as yet a single marsupial\r\nbone. Were we to assume on such scanty data that no warm-blooded\r\nquadrupeds were then to be found throughout the northern hemisphere,\r\nthere would still remain a curious subject of speculation, whether the\r\nentire suppression of one important class of vertebrata, such as the\r\nmammiferous, and the great development of another, such as the\r\nreptilian, implies a departure from fixed and uniform rules governing\r\nthe fluctuations of the animal world; such rules, for example, as appear\r\nfrom one century to another to determine the growth of certain tribes of\r\nplants and animals in arctic, and of other tribes in tropical regions.\r\n\r\nIn Australia, New Zealand, and many other parts of the southern\r\nhemisphere, where the indigenous land quadrupeds are comparatively few,\r\nand of small dimensions, the reptiles do not predominate in number or\r\nsize. The deposits formed at the mouth of an Australian river, within\r\nthe tropics, might contain the bones of only a few small marsupial\r\nanimals, which, like those of Stonesfield, might hereafter be discovered\r\nwith difficulty by geologists; but there would, at the same time, be no\r\nmegalosauri and other fossil remains, showing that large saurians were\r\nplentiful on the land and in the waters at a time when mammalia were\r\nscarce. This example, therefore, would afford a very imperfect parallel\r\nto the state of the animal kingdom, supposed to have prevailed during\r\nthe secondary periods, when a high temperature pervaded European\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\nIt may nevertheless be advantageous to point to some existing anomalies\r\nin the geographical development of distinct classes of vertebrata which\r\nmay be comparable to former conditions of the animal creation brought to\r\nlight by geology. Thus in the arctic regions, at present, reptiles are\r\nsmall, and sometimes wholly wanting, where birds, large land quadrupeds,\r\nand cetacea abound. We meet with bears, wolves, foxes, musk oxen, and\r\ndeer, walruses, seals, whales, and narwals, in regions of ice and snow,\r\nwhere the smallest snakes, efts, and frogs are rarely, if ever, seen.\r\n\r\nA still more anomalous state of things presents itself in the southern\r\nhemisphere. Even in the temperate zone, between the latitudes 52 degrees\r\nand 56 degrees S., as, for example, in Tierra del Fuego, as well as in\r\nthe woody region immediately north of the Straits of Magellan, and in\r\nthe Falkland Islands, no reptiles of any kind are met with, not even a\r\nsnake, lizard, or frog; but in these same countries we find the guanaco\r\n(a kind of llama), a deer, the puma, a large species of fox, many small\r\nrodentia, besides the seal and otter, together with the porpoise, whale,\r\nand other cetacea.\r\n\r\nOn what grand laws in the animal physiology these remarkable phenomena\r\ndepend, cannot in the present state of science be conjectured; nor could\r\nwe predict whether any opposite condition of the atmosphere, in respect\r\nto heat, moisture, and other circumstances, would bring about a state of\r\nanimal life which might be called the converse of that above described,\r\nnamely, a state in which reptiles of every size and order might abound,\r\nand mammalia disappear.\r\n\r\nThe nearest approximation to such a fauna is found in the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago. These islands, situated under the equator, and nearly 600\r\nmiles west of the coast of Peru, have been called \"the land of\r\nreptiles,\" so great is the number of snakes, large tortoises, and\r\nlizards, which they support. Among the lizards, the first living species\r\nproper to the ocean has been discovered. Yet, although some of these\r\nislands are from 3000 to 4000 feet high, and one of them 75 miles long,\r\nthey contain, with the exception of one small mouse, no indigenous\r\nmammifer. Even here, however, it is true that in the neighboring sea\r\nthere are seals, and several kinds of cetacea.[221]\r\n\r\nIt may be unreasonable to look for a nearer analogy between the fauna\r\nnow existing in any part of the globe, and that which we can show to\r\nhave prevailed when our secondary strata were deposited, because we must\r\nalways recollect that a climate like that now experienced at the\r\nequator, coexisting with the unequal days and nights of European\r\nlatitudes, was a state of things to which there is now no counterpart on\r\nthe globe. Consequently, the type of animal and vegetable existence\r\nrequired for such a climate might be expected to deviate almost as\r\nwidely from that now established, as do the flora and fauna of our\r\ntropical differ from those of our arctic regions.\r\n\r\n_In the Tertiary strata._--The tertiary formations were deposited when\r\nthe physical geography of the northern hemisphere had been entirely\r\naltered. Large inland lakes had become numerous, as in central France\r\nand other countries. There were gulfs of the sea, into which\r\nconsiderable rivers emptied themselves, and where strata like those of\r\nthe Paris basin were accumulated. There were also formations in\r\nprogress, in shallow seas not far from shore, such as are indicated by\r\nportions of the _Faluns_ of the Loire, and the English _Crag_.\r\n\r\nThe proximity, therefore, of large tracts of dry land to the seas and\r\nlakes then existing, may, in a great measure, explain why the remains of\r\nland animals, so rare in the older strata, are not uncommon in these\r\nmore modern deposits. Yet even these have sometimes proved entirely\r\ndestitute of mammiferous relics for years after they had become\r\ncelebrated for the abundance of their fossil testacea, fish, and\r\nreptiles. Thus the calcaire grossier, a marine limestone of the district\r\nround Paris, had afforded to collectors more than 1100 species of\r\nshells, besides many zoophytes, echinodermata, and the teeth of fish,\r\nbefore the bones of one or two land quadrupeds were met with in the same\r\nrock. The strata called London and Plastic clay in England have been\r\nstudied for more than half a century, and about 400 species of shells,\r\n50 or more of fish, besides several kinds of chelonian and saurian\r\nreptiles, were known before a single mammifer was detected. At length,\r\nin the year 1839, there were found in this formation the remains of a\r\nmonkey, an opossum, a bat,[222] and a species of the extinct genus\r\nHyracotherium, allied to the Peccary or hog tribe.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the strata above the London clay in England, we first meet\r\nwith mammiferous remains in the Isle of Wight, in beds also belonging to\r\nthe Eocene epoch, such as the remains of the Palaeotherium,\r\nAnoplotherium, and other extinct quadrupeds, agreeing very closely with\r\nthose first found by Cuvier, near Paris, in strata of the same age, and\r\nof similar freshwater origin.\r\n\r\nIn France we meet with another fauna, both conchological and mammalian\r\nin the Miocene \"faluns\" of the Loire; above which in the ascending\r\nseries in Great Britain we arrive at the coralline crag of Suffolk, a\r\nmarine formation which has yielded three or four hundred species of\r\nshells, very different from the Eocene testacea, and of which a large\r\nproportion, although a minority of the whole number, are recent, besides\r\nmany corals, echini, foraminifera, and fish, but as yet no relic\r\ndecidedly mammalian except the ear-bone of a whale.\r\n\r\nIn the shelly sand, provincially termed \"Red Crag,\" in Suffolk, which\r\nimmediately succeeds the coralline, constituting a newer member of the\r\nsame tertiary group, about 250 species of shells have been recognized,\r\nof which a still larger proportion are recent. They are associated with\r\nnumerous teeth of fish; but no signs of a warm-blooded quadruped had\r\nbeen detected until 1839, when the teeth of a leopard, a bear, a hog,\r\nand a species of ruminant, were found at Newbourn, in Suffolk, and since\r\nthat time, several other genera of mammalia have been met with in the\r\nsame formation, or in the Red Crag.[223]\r\n\r\nOf a still newer date is the Norwich Crag, a fluvio-marine deposit of\r\nthe Pleiocene epoch, containing a mixture of marine, fluviatile, and\r\nland shells, of which 90 per cent. or more are recent. These beds,\r\nsince the time of their first investigation, have yielded a supply of\r\nmammalian bones of the genera mastodon, elephant, rhinoceros, pig,\r\nhorse, deer, ox, and others, the bodies of which may have been washed\r\ndown into the sea by rivers draining land, of which the contiguity is\r\nindicated by the occasional presence of terrestrial and freshwater\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nOur acquaintance with the newer Pleiocene mammalia in Europe, South\r\nAmerica, and Australia, is derived chiefly from cavern deposits, a fact\r\nwhich we ought never to forget if we desire to appreciate the superior\r\nfacilities we enjoy for studying the more modern as compared to the more\r\nancient terrestrial faunas. We know nothing of the fossil bones which\r\nmust have been inclosed in the stalagmite of caverns in the older\r\nPleiocene, or in the Miocene or Eocene epochs, much less can we derive\r\nany information respecting the inhabitants of the land from a similar\r\nsource, when we carry back our inquiries to the Wealden or carboniferous\r\nepochs. We are as well assured that land and rivers then existed, as\r\nthat they exist now; but it is evident that even a slight geographical\r\nrevolution, accompanied by the submergence and denudation of land, would\r\nreduce to an extreme improbability the chance of our hitting on those\r\nminute points of space where caves may once have occurred in limestone\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n_Fossil quadrumana._--Until within a few years (1836, 1837), not a\r\nsingle bone of any quadrumanous animal, such as the orang, ape, baboon,\r\nand monkey, had been discovered in a fossil state, although so much\r\nprogress had been made in bringing to light the extinct mammalia of\r\nsuccessive tertiary eras, both carnivorous and herbivorous. The total\r\nabsence of these anthropomorphous tribes among the records of a former\r\nworld, had led some to believe that the type of organization most nearly\r\nresembling the human, came so late in the order of creation, as to be\r\nscarcely, if at all, anterior to that of man. That such generalizations\r\nwere premature, I endeavored to point out in the first edition of this\r\nwork,[224] in which I stated that the bones of quadrupeds hitherto met\r\nwith in tertiary deposits were chiefly those which frequent marshes,\r\nrivers, or the borders of lakes, as the elephant, rhinoceros,\r\nhippopotamus, tapir, hog, deer, and ox, while species which live in\r\ntrees are extremely rare in a fossil state. I also hinted, that we had\r\nas yet no data for determining how great a number of the one kind we\r\nought to find, before we have a right to expect a single individual of\r\nthe other. Lastly, I observed that the climate of the more modern (or\r\nPost-Eocene) tertiary periods in England was not tropical, and that in\r\nregard to the London clay, of which the crocodiles, turtles, and fossil\r\nfruits implied a climate hot enough for the quadrumana, we had as yet\r\nmade too little progress in ascertaining what were the Eocene\r\npachydermata of England, to entitle us to expect to have discovered any\r\nquadrumana of the same date.\r\n\r\nSince those remarks were first written, in 1829, a great number of\r\nextinct species have been added to our collections of tertiary mammalia\r\nfrom Great Britain and other parts of the world. At length, between the\r\nyears 1836 and 1839, a few remains of quadrumana were found in France\r\nand England, India and Brazil. Those of India, belonging to more than\r\none extinct species of monkey, were first discovered near the Sutlej, in\r\nlat. 30 degrees N., in tertiary strata, of which the age is not yet\r\ndetermined; the Brazilian fossil, brought from the basin of the Rio das\r\nVelhas, about lat. 18 degrees S., is referable to a form now peculiar in\r\nAmerica, allied to the genus Callithrix, the species being extinct. The\r\nskull and other bones met with in the South of France belong to a\r\ngibbon, or one of the tailless apes, which stand next in the scale of\r\norganization to the orang. It occurred at Sansan, about forty miles west\r\nof Toulouse, in lat. 43 degrees 40 minutes N., in freshwater strata,\r\nprobably of the Miocene or middle tertiary period. Lastly, the English\r\nquadrumane first met with, occurred in a more ancient stratum than the\r\nrest, and at a point more remote from the equator. It belongs to the\r\ngenus Macacus, is an extinct species, and was found in Suffolk, in lat.\r\n52 degrees,[225] in the London clay, the fossils of which, such as\r\ncrocodiles, turtles, shells of the genus Nautilus, and many curious\r\nfruits, had already led geologists to the conclusion that the climate of\r\nthat era (the Eocene) was warm and nearly tropical.\r\n\r\nSome years later (in 1846) the jaw of another British species of fossil\r\nmonkey, Macacus pliocenus, was announced by Mr. Owen as having been met\r\nwith in the newer Pleiocene strata, on the banks of the Thames, at\r\nGrays, in Essex, accompanying the remains of hippopotamus, elephant, and\r\nother quadrupeds, and associated with freshwater and land shells, most\r\nof which are now inhabitants of the British Isles.[226]\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the small area of the earth's surface hitherto\r\nexplored geologically, and the new discoveries brought to light daily,\r\neven in the environs of great European capitals, we must feel that it\r\nwould be rash to assume that the Lower Eocene deposits mark the era of\r\nthe first creation of quadrumana. It would, however, be still more\r\nunphilosophical to infer, as some writers have done, from a single\r\nextinct species of this family obtained in a latitude far from the\r\ntropics, that the Eocene quadrumana did not attain as high a grade of\r\norganization as they do in our own times. What would the naturalist know\r\nof the apes and orangs now contemporary with man, if our investigations\r\nwere restricted to such northern latitudes as those where alone the\r\ngeologist has hitherto found all the fossil quadrumana of Europe?\r\n\r\n_Cetacea._--The absence of Cetacea from rocks older than the Eocene has\r\nbeen frequently adduced as lending countenance to the theory of the very\r\nlate appearance of the highest class of Vertebrata on the earth.\r\nProfessor Sedgwick possesses in the Cambridge Museum a mass of\r\nanchylosed cervical vertebrae of a whale, which he found in drift clay\r\nnear Ely, and which he has no doubt was washed out of the Kimmeridge\r\nclay, an upper member of the Oolite. According to Professor Owen, it\r\nexhibits well-marked specific characters, distinguishing it from all\r\nother known recent or fossil cetacea. Dr. Leidy, of Philadelphia, has\r\nlately described (1851) two species of cetacea of a new genus, which he\r\nhas called Priscodelphinus from the green sand of New Jersey, which\r\ncorresponds in age with the English Chalk or the cretaceous strata above\r\nthe gault. The specimens consist of dorsal and cervical vertebrae.[227]\r\nEven in the Eocene strata of Europe, the discovery of cetaceans has\r\nnever kept pace with that of land quadrupeds. The only instance cited in\r\nGreat Britain is a species of Monodon, from the London clay, of doubtful\r\nauthenticity as to its geological position. On the other hand, the\r\ngigantic Zeuglodon of North America occurs abundantly in the Middle\r\nEocene strata of Georgia and Alabama, from which as yet no bones of land\r\nquadrupeds have been obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the present imperfect state then of our information, we can scarcely\r\nsay more than that the cetacea seem to have been scarce in the secondary\r\nand primary periods. It is quite conceivable that when aquatic saurians,\r\nsome of them carnivorous, like the Ichthyosaurus, were swarming in the\r\nsea, and when there were large herbivorous reptiles, like the Iguanodon,\r\non the land, the class of reptiles may, to a certain extent, have\r\nsuperseded the cetacea, and discharged their functions in the animal\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nThat mammalia had been created long before the epoch of the Kimmeridge\r\nclay, is shown by the Microlestes of the Trias before alluded to, and by\r\nthe Stonesfield quadrupeds from the Inferior Oolite. And we are bound to\r\nremember, whenever we infer the poverty of the flora or fauna of any\r\ngiven period of the past, from the small number of fossils occurring in\r\nancient rocks, that it has been evidently no part of the plan of Nature\r\nto hand down to us a complete or systematic record of the former history\r\nof the animate world. We may have failed to discover a single shell,\r\nmarine or freshwater, or a single coral or bone in certain sandstones,\r\nsuch as that of the valley of the Connecticut, where the footprints of\r\nbipeds and quadrupeds abound; but such failure may have arisen, not\r\nbecause the population of the land or sea was scanty at that era, but\r\nbecause in general the preservation of any relics of the animals or\r\nplants of former times is the exception to a general rule. Time so\r\nenormous as that contemplated by the geologist may multiply exceptional\r\ncases till they seem to constitute the rule, and so impose on the\r\nimagination as to lead us to infer the non-existence of creatures of\r\nwhich no monuments happen to remain. Professor Forbes has remarked, that\r\nfew geologists are aware how large a proportion of all known species of\r\nfossils are founded on single specimens, while a still greater number\r\nare founded on a few individuals discovered in one spot. This holds true\r\nnot only in regard to animals and plants inhabiting the land, the lake,\r\nand the river, but even to a surprising number of the marine mollusca,\r\narticulata, and radiata. Our knowledge, therefore, of the living\r\ncreation of any given period of the past may be said to depend in a\r\ngreat degree on what we commonly call chance, and the casual discovery\r\nof some new localities rich in peculiar fossils may modify or entirely\r\noverthrow all our previous generalizations.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole then we derive this result from a general review of the\r\nfossils of the successive tertiary strata, namely, that since the Eocene\r\nperiod, there have been several great changes in the land quadrupeds\r\ninhabiting Europe, probably not less than five complete revolutions,\r\nduring which there has been no step whatever made in advance, no\r\nelevation in the scale of being; so that had man been created at the\r\ncommencement of the Eocene era, he would not have constituted a greater\r\ninnovation on the state of the animal creation previously established\r\nthan now, when we believe him to have begun to exist at the close of the\r\nPleiocene. The views, therefore, which I proposed in the first edition\r\nof this work, January, 1830, in opposition to the theory of progressive\r\ndevelopment, do not seem to me to require material modification,\r\nnotwithstanding the large additions since made to our knowledge of\r\nfossil remains.\r\n\r\nThese views may be thus briefly stated. From the earliest period at\r\nwhich plants and animals can be proved to have existed, there has been a\r\ncontinual change going on in the position of land and sea, accompanied\r\nby great fluctuations of climate. To these ever-varying geographical and\r\nclimatal conditions the state of the animate world has been unceasingly\r\nadapted. No satisfactory proof has yet been discovered of the gradual\r\npassage of the earth from a chaotic to a more habitable state, nor of\r\nany law of progressive development governing the extinction and\r\nrenovation of species, and causing the fauna and flora to pass from an\r\nembryonic to a more perfect condition, from a simple to a more complex\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThe principle of adaptation to which I have alluded, appears to have\r\nbeen analogous to that which now peoples the arctic, temperate, and\r\ntropical regions contemporaneously with distinct assemblages of species\r\nand genera, or which, independently of mere temperature, gives rise to a\r\npredominance of the marsupial or didelphous tribe of quadrupeds in\r\nAustralia, of the placental or monodelphous tribe in Asia and Europe, or\r\nwhich causes a profusion of reptiles without mammalia in the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago, and of mammalia without reptiles in Greenland.\r\n\r\n_Recent origin of man._--If, then, the popular theory of the successive\r\ndevelopment of the animal and vegetable world, from the simplest to the\r\nmost perfect forms, rests on a very insecure foundation; it may be\r\nasked, whether the recent origin of man lends any support to the same\r\ndoctrine, or how far the influence of man may be considered as such a\r\ndeviation from the analogy of the order of things previously\r\nestablished, as to weaken our confidence in the uniformity of the course\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\nAntecedently to investigation, we might reasonably have anticipated that\r\nthe vestiges of man would have been traced back at least as far as those\r\nmodern strata in which all the testacea and a certain number of the\r\nmammalia are of existing species, for of all the mammalia the human\r\nspecies is the most cosmopolite, and perhaps more capable than any other\r\nof surviving considerable vicissitudes in climate, and in the physical\r\ngeography of the globe.\r\n\r\nNo inhabitant of the land exposes himself to so many dangers on the\r\nwaters as man, whether in a savage or a civilized state;[228] and there\r\nis no animal, therefore, whose skeleton is so liable to become imbedded\r\nin lacustrine or submarine deposits; nor can it be said that his remains\r\nare more perishable than those of other animals; for in ancient fields\r\nof battle, as Cuvier has observed, the bones of men have suffered as\r\nlittle decomposition as those of horses which were buried in the same\r\ngrave.[229] But even if the more solid parts of our species had\r\ndisappeared, the impression of their form would have remained engraven\r\non the rocks, as have the traces of the tenderest leaves of plants, and\r\nthe soft integuments of many animals. Works of art, moreover, composed\r\nof the most indestructible materials, would have outlasted almost all\r\nthe organic contents of sedimentary rocks. Edifices, and even entire\r\ncities, have, within the times of history, been buried under volcanic\r\nejections, submerged beneath the sea, or engulfed by earthquakes; and\r\nhad these catastrophes been repeated throughout an indefinite lapse of\r\nages, the high antiquity of man would have been inscribed in far more\r\nlegible characters on the framework of the globe than are the forms of\r\nthe ancient vegetation which once covered the islands of the northern\r\nocean, or of those gigantic reptiles which at still later periods\r\npeopled the seas and rivers of the northern hemisphere.[230]\r\n\r\nDr. Prichard has argued that the human race have not always existed on\r\nthe surface of the earth, because \"the strata of which our continents\r\nare composed were once a part of the ocean's bed\"--\"mankind had a\r\nbeginning, since we can look back to the period when the surface on\r\nwhich they lived began to exist.\"[231] This proof, however, is\r\ninsufficient, for many thousands of human beings now dwell in various\r\nquarters of the globe where marine species lived within the times of\r\nhistory, and, on the other hand, the sea now prevails permanently over\r\nlarge districts once inhabited by thousands of human beings. Nor can\r\nthis interchange of sea and land ever cease while the present causes are\r\nin existence. Terrestrial species, therefore, might be older than the\r\ncontinents which they inhabit, and aquatic species of higher antiquity\r\nthan the lakes and seas which they now people.\r\n\r\nBut so far as our interpretation of physical movements has yet gone, we\r\nhave every reason to infer that the human race is extremely modern, even\r\nwhen compared to the larger number of species now our contemporaries on\r\nthe earth, and we may, therefore, ask whether his creation can be\r\nconsidered as one step in a supposed progressive system, by which the\r\norganic world has advanced slowly from a more simple to a more complex\r\nand perfect state? If we concede, for a moment, the truth of the\r\nproposition, that the sponge, the cephalopod, the fish, the reptile, the\r\nbird, and the mammifer, have followed each other in regular\r\nchronological order, the creation of each class being separated from the\r\nother by vast intervals of time, should we be able to recognize, in\r\nman's entrance upon the earth, the last term of one and the same series\r\nof progressive developments?\r\n\r\nIn reply to this question it should first be observed, that the\r\nsuperiority of man depends not on those faculties and attributes which\r\nhe shares in common with the inferior animals, but on his reason, by\r\nwhich he is distinguished from them. When it is said that the human race\r\nis of far higher dignity than were any pre-existing beings on the earth,\r\nit is the intellectual and moral attributes of our race, rather than the\r\nphysical, which are considered; and it is by no means clear that the\r\norganization of man is such as would confer a decided pre-eminence upon\r\nhim, if, in place of his reasoning powers, he was merely provided with\r\nsuch instincts as are possessed by the lower animals.\r\n\r\nIf this be admitted, it would not follow, even if there were sufficient\r\ngeological evidence in favor of the theory of progressive development,\r\nthat the creation of man was the last link in the same chain. For the\r\nsudden passage from an irrational to a rational animal, is a phenomenon\r\nof a distinct kind from the passage from the more simple to the more\r\nperfect forms of animal organization and instinct. To pretend that such\r\na step, or rather leap, can be part of a regular series of changes in\r\nthe animal world, is to strain analogy beyond all reasonable bounds.\r\n\r\n_Introduction of man, to what extent a change in the system._--But\r\nsetting aside the question of progressive development, another and a far\r\nmore difficult one may arise out of the admission that man is\r\ncomparatively of modern origin. Is not the interference of the human\r\nspecies, it may be asked, such a deviation from the antecedent course of\r\nphysical events, that the knowledge of such a fact tends to destroy all\r\nour confidence in the uniformity of the order of nature, both in regard\r\nto time past and future? If such an innovation could take place after\r\nthe earth had been exclusively inhabited for thousands of ages by\r\ninferior animals, why should not other changes as extraordinary and\r\nunprecedented happen from time to time? If one new cause was permitted\r\nto supervene, differing in kind and energy from any before in operation,\r\nwhy may not others have come into action at different epochs? Or what\r\nsecurity have we that they may not arise hereafter? And if such be the\r\ncase, how can the experience of one period, even though we are\r\nacquainted with all the possible effects of the then existing causes, be\r\na standard to which we can refer all natural phenomena of other periods?\r\n\r\nNow these objections would be unanswerable, if adduced against one who\r\nwas contending for the absolute uniformity throughout all time of the\r\nsuccession of sublunary events--if, for example, he was disposed to\r\nindulge in the philosophical reveries of some Egyptian and Greek sects,\r\nwho represented all the changes both of the moral and material world as\r\nrepeated at distant intervals, so as to follow each other in their\r\nformer connection of place and time. For they compared the course of\r\nevents on our globe to astronomical cycles; and not only did they\r\nconsider all sublunary affairs to be under the influence of the\r\ncelestial bodies, but they taught that on the earth, as well as in the\r\nheavens, the same identical phenomena recurred again and again in a\r\nperpetual vicissitude. The same individual men were doomed to be\r\nre-born, and to perform the same actions as before; the same arts were\r\nto be invented, and the same cities built and destroyed. The Argonautic\r\nexpedition was destined to sail again with the same heroes, and Achilles\r\nwith his Myrmidons to renew, the combat before the walls of Troy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Alter erit tum Tiphys, et altera quae vehat Argo\r\n  Dilectos heroas; erunt etiam altera bella,\r\n  Atque iterum ad Trojam magnus mittetur Achilles.[232]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geologist, however, may condemn these tenets as absurd, without\r\nrunning into the opposite extreme, and denying that the order of nature\r\nhas, from the earliest periods, been uniform in the same sense in which\r\nwe believe it to be uniform at present, and expect it to remain so in\r\nfuture. We have no reason to suppose, that when man first became master\r\nof a small part of the globe, a greater change took place in its\r\nphysical condition than is now experienced when districts, never before\r\ninhabited, become successively occupied by new settlers. When a powerful\r\nEuropean colony lands on the shores of Australia, and introduces at once\r\nthose arts which it has required many centuries to mature; when it\r\nimports a multitude of plants and large animals from the opposite\r\nextremity of the earth, and begins rapidly to extirpate many of the\r\nindigenous species, a mightier revolution is effected in a brief period\r\nthan the first entrance of a savage horde, or their continued occupation\r\nof the country for many centuries, can possibly be imagined to have\r\nproduced. If there be no impropriety in assuming that the system is\r\nuniform when disturbances so unprecedented occur in certain localities,\r\nwe can with much greater confidence apply the same language to those\r\nprimeval ages when the aggregate number and power of the human race, or\r\nthe rate of their advancement in civilization, must be supposed to have\r\nbeen far inferior. In reasoning on the state of the globe immediately\r\nbefore our species was called into existence, we must be guided by the\r\nsame rules of induction as when we speculate on the state of America in\r\nthe interval that elapsed between the introduction of man into Asia, the\r\nsupposed cradle of our race, and the arrival of the first adventurers on\r\nthe shores of the New World. In that interval, we imagine the state of\r\nthings to have gone on according to the order now observed in regions\r\nunoccupied by man. Even now, the waters of lakes, seas, and the great\r\nocean, which teem with life, may be said to have no immediate relation\r\nto the human race--to be portions of the terrestrial system of which man\r\nhas never taken, nor ever can take possession; so that the greater part\r\nof the inhabited surface of the planet may still remain as insensible to\r\nour presence as before any isle or continent was appointed to be our\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nIf the barren soil around Sydney had at once become fertile upon the\r\nlanding of our first settlers; if, like the happy isles whereof the\r\npoets have given such glowing descriptions, those sandy tracts had begun\r\nto yield spontaneously an annual supply of grain, we might then, indeed,\r\nhave fancied alterations still more remarkable in the economy of nature\r\nto have attended the first coming of our species into the planet. Or if,\r\nwhen a volcanic island like Ischia was, for the first time, brought\r\nunder cultivation by the enterprise and industry of a Greek colony, the\r\ninternal fire had become dormant, and the earthquake had remitted its\r\ndestructive violence, there would then have been some ground for\r\nspeculating on the debilitation of the subterranean forces, when the\r\nearth was first placed under the dominion of man. But after a long\r\ninterval of rest, the volcano bursts forth again with renewed energy,\r\nannihilates one half of the inhabitants, and compels the remainder to\r\nemigrate. The course of nature remains evidently unchanged; and, in like\r\nmanner, we may suppose the general condition of the globe, immediately\r\nbefore and after the period when our species first began to exist, to\r\nhave been the same, with the exception only of man's presence.\r\n\r\nThe modifications in the system of which man is the instrument do not,\r\nperhaps, constitute so great a deviation from previous analogy as we\r\nusually imagine; we often, for example, form an exaggerated estimate of\r\nthe extent of our power in extirpating some of the inferior animals, and\r\ncausing others to multiply; a power which is circumscribed within\r\ncertain limits, and which, in all likelihood, is by no means exclusively\r\nexerted by our species.[233] The growth of human population cannot take\r\nplace without diminishing the numbers, or causing the entire\r\ndestruction, of many animals. The larger beasts of prey, in particular,\r\ngive way before us; but other quadrupeds of smaller size, and\r\ninnumerable birds, insects, and plants, which are inimical to our\r\ninterests, increase in spite of us, some attacking our food, others our\r\nraiment and persons, and others interfering with our agricultural and\r\nhorticultural labors. We behold the rich harvest which we have raised by\r\nthe sweat of our brow, devoured by myriads of insects, and are often as\r\nincapable of arresting their depredations, as of staying the shock of an\r\nearthquake, or the course of a stream of lava.\r\n\r\nA great philosopher has observed, that we can command nature only by\r\nobeying her laws; and this principle is true even in regard to the\r\nastonishing changes which are superinduced in the qualities of certain\r\nanimals and plants by domestication and garden culture. I shall point\r\nout in the third book that we can only effect such surprising\r\nalterations by assisting the development of certain instincts, or by\r\navailing ourselves of that mysterious law of their organization, by\r\nwhich individual peculiarities are transmissible from one generation to\r\nanother.[234]\r\n\r\nIt is probable from these and many other considerations, that as we\r\nenlarge our knowledge of the system, we shall become more and more\r\nconvinced, that the alterations caused by the interference of man\r\ndeviate far less from the analogy of those effected by other animals\r\nthan is usually supposed.[235] We are often misled, when we institute\r\nsuch comparisons, by our knowledge of the wide distinction between the\r\ninstincts of animals and the reasoning power of man; and we are apt\r\nhastily to infer, that the effects of a rational and irrational species,\r\nconsidered merely as _physical agents_, will differ almost as much as\r\nthe faculties by which their actions are directed.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, intended that a real departure from the antecedent\r\ncourse of physical events cannot be traced in the introduction of man.\r\nIf that latitude of action which enables the brutes to accommodate\r\nthemselves in some measure to accidental circumstances could be imagined\r\nto have been at any former period so great, that the operations of\r\ninstinct were as much diversified as are those of human reason, it\r\nmight, perhaps, be contended, that the agency of man did not constitute\r\nan anomalous deviation from the previously established order of things.\r\nIt might then have been said, that the earth's becoming at a particular\r\nperiod the residence of human beings, was an era in the moral, not in\r\nthe physical world--that our study and contemplation of the earth, and\r\nthe laws which govern its animate productions, ought no more to be\r\nconsidered in the light of a disturbance or deviation from the system,\r\nthan the discovery of the satellites of Jupiter should be regarded as a\r\nphysical event affecting those heavenly bodies. Their influence in\r\nadvancing the progress of science among men, and in aiding navigation\r\nand commerce, was accompanied by no reciprocal action of the human mind\r\nupon the economy of nature in those distant planets; and so the earth\r\nmight be conceived to have become, at a certain period, a place of moral\r\ndiscipline and intellectual improvement to man, without the slightest\r\nderangement of a previously existing order of change in its animate and\r\ninanimate productions.\r\n\r\nThe distinctness, however, of the human from all other species,\r\nconsidered merely as an efficient cause in the physical world, is real;\r\nfor we stand in a relation to contemporary species of animals and plants\r\nwidely different from that which other irrational animals can ever be\r\nsupposed to have held to each other. We modify their instincts, relative\r\nnumbers, and geographical distribution, in a manner superior in degree,\r\nand in some respects very different in kind from that in which any other\r\nspecies can affect the rest. Besides, the progressive movement of each\r\nsuccessive generation of men causes the human species to differ more\r\nfrom itself in power at two distant periods, than any one species of the\r\nhigher order of animals differs from another. The establishment,\r\ntherefore, by geological evidence, of the first intervention of such a\r\npeculiar and unprecedented agency, long after other parts of the animate\r\nand inanimate world existed, affords ground for concluding that the\r\nexperience during thousands of ages of all the events which may happen\r\non this globe, would not enable a philosopher to speculate with\r\nconfidence concerning future contingencies.\r\n\r\nIf, then, an intelligent being, after observing the order of events for\r\nan indefinite series of ages, had witnessed at last so wonderful an\r\ninnovation as this, to what extent would his belief in the regularity of\r\nthe system be weakened?--would he cease to assume that there was\r\npermanency in the laws of nature?--would he no longer be guided in his\r\nspeculations by the strictest rules of induction? To these questions it\r\nmay be answered, that, had he previously presumed to dogmatize\r\nrespecting the absolute uniformity of the order of nature, he would\r\nundoubtedly be checked by witnessing this new and unexpected event, and\r\nwould form a more just estimate of the limited range of his own\r\nknowledge, and the unbounded extent of the scheme of the universe. But\r\nhe would soon perceive that no one of the fixed and constant laws of the\r\nanimate or inanimate world was subverted by human agency, and that the\r\nmodifications now introduced for the first time were the accompaniments\r\nof new and extraordinary circumstances, and those not of a _physical_\r\nbut a _moral_ nature. The deviation permitted would also appear to be as\r\nslight as was consistent with the accomplishment of the new _moral_ ends\r\nproposed, and to be in a great degree temporary in its nature, so that,\r\nwhenever the power of the new agent was withheld, even for a brief\r\nperiod, a relapse would take place to the ancient state of things; the\r\ndomesticated animal, for example, recovering in a few generations its\r\nwild instinct, and the garden-flower and fruit-tree reverting to the\r\nlikeness of the parent stock.\r\n\r\nNow, if it would be reasonable to draw such inferences with respect to\r\nthe future, we cannot but apply the same rules of induction to the\r\npast. We have no right to anticipate any modifications in the results of\r\nexisting causes in time to come, which are not conformable to analogy,\r\nunless they be produced by the progressive development of human power,\r\nor perhaps by some other new relations which may hereafter spring up\r\nbetween the moral and material worlds. In the same manner, when we\r\nspeculate on the vicissitudes of the animate and inanimate creation in\r\nformer ages, we ought not to look for any anomalous results, unless\r\nwhere man has interfered, or unless clear indications appear of some\r\nother _moral_ source of temporary derangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSUPPOSED INTENSITY OF AQUEOUS FORCES AT REMOTE PERIODS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Intensity of aqueous causes--Slow accumulation of strata proved by\r\n    fossils--Rate of denudation can only keep pace with\r\n    deposition--Erratics, and effects of ice--Deluges, and the causes to\r\n    which they are referred--Supposed universality of ancient deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Intensity of aqueous causes._--The great problem considered in the\r\npreceding chapters, namely, whether the former changes of the earth made\r\nknown to us by geology, resemble in kind and degree those now in daily\r\nprogress, may still be contemplated from several other points of view.\r\nWe may inquire, for example, whether there are any grounds for the\r\nbelief entertained by many, that the intensity both of aqueous and of\r\nigneous forces, in remote ages, far exceeded that which we witness in\r\nour own times.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, as to aqueous causes: it has been shown, in our history of\r\nthe science, that Woodward did not hesitate, in 1695, to teach that the\r\nentire mass of fossiliferous strata contained in the earth's crust had\r\nbeen deposited in a few months; and, consequently, as their mechanical\r\nand derivative origin was already admitted, the reduction of rocky\r\nmasses into mud, sand, and pebbles, the transportation of the same to a\r\ndistance, and their accumulation elsewhere in regular strata, were all\r\nassumed to have taken place with a rapidity unparalleled in modern\r\ntimes. This doctrine was modified by degrees, in proportion as different\r\nclasses of organic remains, such as shells, corals, and fossil plants,\r\nhad been studied with attention. Analogy led every naturalist to assume,\r\nthat each full-grown individual of the animal or vegetable kingdom, had\r\nrequired a certain number of months or years for the attainment of\r\nmaturity, and the perpetuation of its species by generation; and thus\r\nthe first approach was made to the conception of a common standard of\r\ntime, without which there are no means whatever of measuring the\r\ncomparative rate at which any succession of events has taken place at\r\ntwo distinct periods. This standard consisted of the average duration of\r\nthe lives of individuals of the same genera or families in the animal\r\nand vegetable kingdoms; and the multitude of fossils dispersed through\r\nsuccessive strata implied the continuance of the same species for many\r\ngenerations. At length the idea that species themselves had had a\r\nlimited duration, arose out of the observed fact that sets of strata of\r\ndifferent ages contained fossils of distinct species. Finally, the\r\nopinion became general, that in the course of ages, one assemblage of\r\nanimals and plants had disappeared after another again and again, and\r\nnew tribes had started into life to replace them.\r\n\r\n_Denudation._--In addition to the proofs derived from organic remains,\r\nthe forms of stratification led also, on a fuller investigation, to the\r\nbelief that sedimentary rocks had been slowly deposited; but it was\r\nstill supposed that _denudation_, or the power of running water, and the\r\nwaves and currents of the ocean, to strip off superior strata, and lay\r\nbare the rocks below, had formerly operated with an energy wholly\r\nunequalled in our times. These opinions were both illogical and\r\ninconsistent, because deposition and denudation are parts of the same\r\nprocess, and what is true of the one must be true of the other. Their\r\nspeed must be always limited by the same causes, and the conveyance of\r\nsolid matter to a particular region can only keep pace with its removal\r\nfrom another, so that the aggregate of sedimentary strata in the earth's\r\ncrust can never exceed in volume the amount of solid matter which has\r\nbeen ground down and washed away by running water. How vast, then, must\r\nbe the spaces which this abstraction of matter has left vacant! how far\r\nexceeding in dimensions all the valleys, however numerous, and the\r\nhollows, however vast, which we can prove to have been cleared out by\r\naqueous erosion! The evidences of the work of denudation are defective,\r\nbecause it is the nature of every destroying cause to obliterate the\r\nsigns of its own agency; but the amount of reproduction in the form of\r\nsedimentary strata must always afford a true measure of the minimum of\r\ndenudation which the earth's surface has undergone.\r\n\r\n_Erratics._--The next phenomenon to which the advocates of the excessive\r\npower of running water in times past have appealed, is the enormous size\r\nof the blocks called _erratic_, which lie scattered over the northern\r\nparts of Europe and North America. Unquestionably a large proportion of\r\nthese blocks have been transported far from their original position, for\r\nbetween them and the parent rocks we now find, not unfrequently, deep\r\nseas and valleys intervening, or hills more than a thousand feet high.\r\nTo explain the present situation of such travelled fragments, a deluge\r\nof mud has been imagined by some to have come from the north, bearing\r\nalong with it sand, gravel, and stony fragments, some of them hundreds\r\nof tons in weight. This flood, in its transient passage over the\r\ncontinents, dispersed the boulders irregularly over hill, valley, and\r\nplain; or forced them along over a surface of hard rock, so as to polish\r\nit and leave it indented with parallel scratches and grooves--such\r\nmarkings as are still visible in the rocks of Scandinavia, Scotland,\r\nCanada, and many other countries.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the myriads of angular and rounded blocks\r\nabove alluded to, cannot have been borne along by ordinary rivers or\r\nmarine currents, so great is their volume and weight, and so clear are\r\nthe signs, in many places, of time having been occupied in their\r\nsuccessive deposition; for they are often distributed at various depths\r\nthrough heaps of regularly stratified sand and gravel. No waves of the\r\nsea raised by earthquakes, nor the bursting of lakes dammed up for a\r\ntime by landslips or by avalanches of snow, can account for the observed\r\nfacts; but I shall endeavor to show, in the next book, chap. 15,[236]\r\nthat a combination of existing causes may have conveyed erratics into\r\ntheir present situations.\r\n\r\nThe causes which will be referred to are, first, the carrying power of\r\nice, combined with that of running water; and second, the upward\r\nmovement of the bed of the sea, converting it gradually into land.\r\nWithout entering at present into any details respecting these causes, I\r\nmay mention that the transportation of blocks by ice is now\r\nsimultaneously in progress in the cold and temperate latitudes, both of\r\nthe northern and southern hemisphere, as, for example, on the coasts of\r\nCanada and Gulf of St. Lawrence, and also in Chili, Patagonia, and the\r\nisland of South Georgia. In those regions the uneven bed of the ocean is\r\nbecoming strewed over with ice-drifted fragments, which have either\r\nstranded on shoals, or been dropped in deep water by melting bergs. The\r\nentanglement of boulders in drift-ice will also be shown to occur\r\nannually in North America, and these stones, when firmly frozen into\r\nice, wander year after year from Labrador to the St. Lawrence, and reach\r\npoints of the western hemisphere farther south than any part of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThe general absence of erratics in the warmer parts of the equatorial\r\nregions of Asia, Africa, and America, confirms the same views. As to the\r\npolishing and grooving of hard rocks, it has lately been ascertained\r\nthat glaciers give rise to these effects when pushing forward sand,\r\npebbles, and rocky fragments, and causing them to grate along the\r\nbottom. Nor can there be any reasonable doubt that icebergs, when they\r\nrun aground on the floor of the ocean, must imprint similar marks upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary, therefore, to refer to deluges, or even to speculate\r\non the former existence of a climate more severe than that now\r\nprevailing in the western hemisphere, to explain the geographical\r\ndistribution of most of the European erratics.\r\n\r\n_Deluges._--As deluges have been often alluded to, I shall say something\r\nof the causes which may be supposed to give rise to these grand\r\nmovements of water in addition to those already alluded to (p. 9).\r\nGeologists who believe that mountain-chains have been thrown up\r\nsuddenly at many successive epochs, imagine that the waters of the\r\nocean may be raised by these convulsions, and then break in terrific\r\nwaves upon the land, sweeping over whole continents, hollowing out\r\nvalleys, and transporting sand, gravel, and erratics, to great\r\ndistances. The sudden rise of the Alps or Andes, it is said, may have\r\nproduced a flood even subsequently to the time when the earth became the\r\nresidence of man. But it seems strange that none of the writers who have\r\nindulged their imaginations in conjectures of this kind, should have\r\nascribed a deluge to the sudden conversion of part of the unfathomable\r\nocean into a shoal rather than to the rise of mountain-chains. In the\r\nlatter case, the mountains themselves could do no more than displace a\r\ncertain quantity of atmospheric air, whereas, the instantaneous\r\nformation of the shoal would displace a vast body of water, which being\r\nheaved up to a great height might roll over and permanently submerge a\r\nlarge portion of a continent.\r\n\r\nIf we restrict ourselves to combinations of causes at present known, it\r\nwould seem that the two principal sources of extraordinary inundations\r\nare, first, the escape of the waters of a large lake raised far above\r\nthe sea; and, secondly, the pouring down of a marine current into lands\r\ndepressed below the mean level of the ocean.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the first of these cases, we may take Lake Superior,\r\nwhich is more than 400 geographical miles in length and about 150 in\r\nbreadth, having an average depth of from 500 to 900 feet. The surface of\r\nthis vast body of fresh water is no less than 600 feet above the level\r\nof the ocean; the lowest part of the barrier which separates the lake on\r\nits southwest side from those streams which flow into the head waters of\r\nthe Mississippi being about 600 feet high. If, therefore, a series of\r\nsubsidences should lower any part of this barrier 600 feet, any\r\nsubsequent rending or depression, even of a few yards at a time, would\r\nallow the sudden escape of vast floods of water into a hydrographical\r\nbasin of enormous extent. If the event happened in the dry season, when\r\nthe ordinary channels of the Mississippi and its tributaries are in a\r\ngreat degree empty, the inundation might not be considerable; but if in\r\nthe flood-season, a region capable of supporting a population of many\r\nmillions might be suddenly submerged. But even this event would be\r\ninsufficient to cause a violent rush of water, and to produce those\r\neffects usually called diluvial; for the difference of level of 600 feet\r\nbetween Lake Superior and the Gulf of Mexico, when distributed over a\r\ndistance of 1800 miles, would give an average fall of only four inches\r\nper mile.\r\n\r\nThe second case before adverted to is where there are large tracts of\r\ndry land beneath the mean level of the ocean. It seems, after much\r\ncontroversy, to be at length a settled point, that the Caspian is really\r\n83 feet 6 inches lower than the Black Sea. As the Caspian covers an area\r\nabout equal to that of Spain, and as its shores are in general low and\r\nflat, there must be many thousand square miles of country less than 83\r\nfeet above the level of that inland sea, and consequently depressed\r\nbelow the Black Sea and Mediterranean. This area includes the site of\r\nthe populous city of Astrakhan and other towns. Into this region the\r\nocean would pour its waters, if the land now intervening between the Sea\r\nof Azof and the Caspian should subside. Yet even if this event should\r\noccur, it is most probable that the submergence of the whole region\r\nwould not be accomplished simultaneously, but by a series of minor\r\nfloods, the sinking of the barrier being gradual.[237]\r\n\r\n_Supposed universality of ancient deposits._--The next fallacy which has\r\nhelped to perpetuate the doctrine that the operations of water were on a\r\ndifferent and grander scale in ancient times, is founded on the\r\nindefinite areas over which homogeneous deposits were supposed to\r\nextend. No modern sedimentary strata, it is said, equally identical in\r\nmineral character and fossil contents, can be traced continuously from\r\none quarter of the globe to another. But the first propagators of these\r\nopinions were very slightly acquainted with the inconstancy in mineral\r\ncomposition of the ancient formations, and equally so of the wide spaces\r\nover which the same kind of sediment is now actually distributed by\r\nrivers and currents in the course of centuries. The persistency of\r\ncharacter in the older series was exaggerated, its extreme variability\r\nin the newer was assumed without proof. In the chapter which treats of\r\nriver-deltas and the dispersion of sediment by currents, and in the\r\ndescription of reefs of coral now growing over areas many hundred miles\r\nin length, I shall have opportunities of convincing the reader of the\r\ndanger of hasty generalizations on this head.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the imagined universality of particular rocks of ancient\r\ndate, it was almost unavoidable that this notion, when once embraced,\r\nshould be perpetuated; for the same kinds of rock have occasionally been\r\nreproduced at successive epochs; and when once the agreement or\r\ndisagreement in mineral character alone was relied on as the test of\r\nage, it followed that similar rocks, if found even at the antipodes,\r\nwere referred to the same era, until the contrary could be shown.\r\n\r\nNow it is usually impossible to combat such an assumption on geological\r\ngrounds, so long as we are imperfectly acquainted with the order of\r\nsuperposition and the organic remains of these same formations. Thus,\r\nfor example, a group of red marl and red sandstone, containing salt and\r\ngypsum, being interposed in England between the Lias and the Coal, all\r\nother red marls and sandstones, associated some of them with salt, and\r\nothers with gypsum, and occurring not only in different parts of Europe,\r\nbut in North America, Peru, India, the salt deserts of Asia, those of\r\nAfrica--in a word, in every quarter of the globe, were referred to one\r\nand the same period. The burden of proof was not supposed to rest with\r\nthose who insisted on the identity in age of all these groups--their\r\nidentity in mineral composition was thought sufficient. It was in vain\r\nto urge as an objection the improbability of the hypothesis which\r\nimplies that all the moving waters on the globe were once simultaneously\r\ncharged with sediment of a red color.\r\n\r\nBut the rashness of pretending to identify, in age, all the red\r\nsandstones and marls in question, has at length been sufficiently\r\nexposed, by the discovery that, even in Europe, they belong decidedly to\r\nmany different epochs. It is already ascertained, that the red sandstone\r\nand red marl containing the rock-salt of Cardona in Catalonia is newer\r\nthan the Oolitic, if not more modern than the Cretaceous period. It is\r\nalso known that certain red marls and variegated sandstones in Auvergne\r\nwhich are undistinguishable in mineral composition from the New Red\r\nSandstone of English geologists, belong, nevertheless, to the Eocene\r\nperiod; and, lastly, the gypseous red marl of Aix, in Provence, formerly\r\nsupposed to be a marine secondary group, is now acknowledged to be a\r\ntertiary freshwater formation. In Nova Scotia one great deposit of red\r\nmarl, sandstone, and gypsum, precisely resembling in mineral character\r\nthe \"New Red\" of England, occurs as a member of the Carboniferous group,\r\nand in the United States near the Falls of Niagara, a similar formation\r\nconstitutes a subdivision of the Silurian series.[238]\r\n\r\nNor was the nomenclature commonly adopted in geology without its\r\ninfluence in perpetuating the erroneous doctrine of universal\r\nformations. Such names, for example, as Chalk, Green Sand, Oolite, Red\r\nMarl, Coal, and others, were given to some of the principal\r\nfossiliferous groups in consequence of mineral peculiarities which\r\nhappened to characterize them in the countries where they were first\r\nstudied. When geologists had at length shown, by means of fossils and\r\nthe order of superposition, that other strata, entirely dissimilar in\r\ncolor, texture, and composition, were of contemporaneous date, it was\r\nthought convenient still to retain the old names. That these were often\r\ninappropriate was admitted; but the student was taught to understand\r\nthem in no other than a chronological sense; so that the Chalk might not\r\nbe a white cretaceous rock, but a hard dolomitic limestone, as in the\r\nAlps, or a brown sandstone or green marl, as in New Jersey, U. S. In\r\nlike manner, the Green Sand, it was said, might in some places be\r\nrepresented by red sandstone, red marl, salt, and gypsum, as in the\r\nnorth of Spain. So the oolitic texture was declared to be rather an\r\nexception than otherwise to the general rule in rocks of the Oolitic\r\nperiod; and it often became necessary to affirm that no particle of\r\ncarbonaceous matter could be detected in districts where the true Coal\r\nseries abounded. In spite of every precaution the habitual use of this\r\nlanguage could scarcely fail to instil into the mind of the pupil an\r\nidea that chalk, coal, salt, red marl, or the Oolitic structure were far\r\nmore widely characteristic of the rocks of a given age than was really\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nThere is still another cause of deception, disposing us to ascribe a\r\nmore limited range to the newer sedimentary formations as compared to\r\nthe older, namely, the very general concealment of the newer strata\r\nbeneath the waters of lakes and seas, and the wide exposure above waters\r\nof the more ancient. The Chalk, for example, now seen stretching for\r\nthousands of miles over different parts of Europe, has become visible to\r\nus by the effect, not of one, but of many distinct series of\r\nsubterranean movements. Time has been required, and a succession of\r\ngeological periods, to raise it above the waves in so many regions; and\r\nif calcareous rocks of the middle and upper tertiary periods have been\r\nformed, as homogeneous in mineral composition throughout equally\r\nextensive regions, it may require convulsions as numerous as all those\r\nwhich have occurred since the origin of the Chalk to bring them up\r\nwithin the sphere of human observation. Hence the rocks of more modern\r\nperiods may appear partial, as compared to those of remoter eras, not\r\nbecause of any original inferiority in their extent, but because there\r\nhas not been sufficient time since their origin for the development of a\r\ngreat series of elevatory movements.\r\n\r\nIn regard, however, to one of the most important characteristics of\r\nsedimentary rocks, their organic remains, many naturalists of high\r\nauthority have maintained that the same species of fossils are more\r\nuniformly distributed through formations of high antiquity than in those\r\nof more modern date, and that distinct zoological and botanical\r\nprovinces, as they are called, which form so striking a feature in the\r\nliving creation, were not established at remote eras. Thus the plants of\r\nthe Coal, the shells, the trilobites of the Silurian rocks, and the\r\nammonites of the Oolite, have been supposed to have a wider geographical\r\nrange than any living species of plants, crustaceans, or mollusks. This\r\nopinion seems in certain cases to be well founded, especially in\r\nrelation to the plants of the Carboniferous epoch, owing probably to the\r\nmore uniform temperature of the globe, at a time when the position of\r\nsea and land was less favorable to variations in climate, according to\r\nprinciples already explained in the seventh and eighth chapters. But a\r\nrecent comparison of the fossils of North American rocks with those of\r\ncorresponding ages in the European series, has proved that the\r\nterrestrial vegetation of the Carboniferous epoch is an exception to the\r\ngeneral rule, and that the fauna and flora of the earth at successive\r\nperiods, from the oldest Silurian to the newest Tertiary was as\r\ndiversified as now. The shells, corals, and other classes of organic\r\nremains demonstrate the fact that the earth might then have been divided\r\ninto separate zoological provinces, in a manner analogous to that\r\nobserved in the geographical distribution of species now living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nON THE SUPPOSED FORMER INTENSITY OF THE IGNEOUS FORCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Volcanic action at successive geological periods--Plutonic rocks of\r\n    different ages--Gradual development of subterranean\r\n    movements--Faults--Doctrine of the sudden upheaval of parallel\r\n    mountain-chains--Objections to the proof of the suddenness of the\r\n    upheaval, and the contemporaneousness of parallel chains--Trains of\r\n    active volcanoes not parallel--As large tracts of land are rising or\r\n    sinking slowly, so narrow zones of land may be pushed up gradually\r\n    to great heights--Bending of strata by lateral pressure--Adequacy of\r\n    the volcanic power to effect this without paroxysmal convulsions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen reasoning on the intensity of volcanic action at former periods, as\r\nwell as on the power of moving water, already treated of, geologists\r\nhave been ever prone to represent Nature as having been prodigal of\r\nviolence and parsimonious of time. Now, although it is less easy to\r\ndetermine the relative ages of the volcanic than of the fossiliferous\r\nformations, it is undeniable that igneous rocks have been produced at\r\nall geological periods, or as often as we find distinct deposits marked\r\nby peculiar animal and vegetable remains. It can be shown that rocks\r\ncommonly called trappean have been injected into fissures, and ejected\r\nat the surface, both before and during the deposition of the\r\nCarboniferous series, and at the time when the Magnesian Limestone, and\r\nwhen the Upper New Red Sandstone were formed, or when the Lias, Oolite,\r\nGreen Sand, Chalk, and the several tertiary groups newer than the chalk,\r\noriginated in succession. Nor is this all: distinct volcanic products\r\nmay be referred to the subordinate divisions of each period, such as the\r\nCarboniferous, as in the county of Fife, in Scotland, where certain\r\nmasses of contemporaneous trap are associated with the Lower, others\r\nwith the Upper Coal measures. And if one of these masses is more\r\nminutely examined, we find it to consist of the products of a great many\r\nsuccessive outbursts, by which scoriae and lava were again and again\r\nemitted, and afterwards consolidated, then fissured, and finally\r\ntraversed by melted matter, constituting what are called dikes.[239] As\r\nwe enlarge, therefore, our knowledge of the ancient rocks formed by\r\nsubterranean heat, we find ourselves compelled to regard them as the\r\naggregate effects of innumerable eruptions, each of which may have been\r\ncomparable in violence to those now experienced in volcanic regions.\r\n\r\nIt may indeed be said that we have as yet no data for estimating the\r\nrelative volume of matter simultaneously in a state of fusion at two\r\ngiven periods, as if we were to compare the columnar basalt of Staffa\r\nand its environs with the lava poured out in Iceland in 1783; but for\r\nthis very reason it would be rash and unphilosophical to assume an\r\nexcess of ancient as contrasted with modern outpourings of melted matter\r\nat particular periods of time.[240] It would be still more presumptuous\r\nto take for granted that the more deep-seated effects of subterranean\r\nheat surpassed at remote eras the corresponding effects of internal heat\r\nin our own times. Certain porphyries and granites, and all the rocks\r\ncommonly called plutonic, are now generally supposed to have resulted\r\nfrom the slow cooling of materials fused and solidified under great\r\npressure; and we cannot doubt that beneath existing volcanoes there are\r\nlarge spaces filled with melted stone, which must for centuries remain\r\nin an incandescent state, and then cool and become hard and crystalline\r\nwhen the subterranean heat shall be exhausted. That lakes of lava are\r\ncontinuous for hundreds of miles beneath the Chilian Andes, seems\r\nestablished by observations made in the year 1835.[241]\r\n\r\nNow, wherever the fluid contents of such reservoirs are poured out\r\nsuccessively from craters in the open air, or at the bottom of the sea,\r\nthe matter so ejected may afford evidence by its arrangement of having\r\noriginated at different periods; but if the subterranean residue after\r\nthe withdrawal of the heat be converted into crystalline or plutonic\r\nrock, the entire mass may seem to have been formed at once, however\r\ncountless the ages required for its fusion and subsequent refrigeration.\r\nAs the idea that all the granite in the earth's crust was produced\r\nsimultaneously, and in a primitive state of the planet, has now been\r\nuniversally abandoned; so the suggestion above adverted to, may put us\r\non our guard against too readily adopting another opinion, namely, that\r\neach large mass of granite was generated in a brief period of time.\r\n\r\nModern writers indeed, of authority, seem more and more agreed that in\r\nthe case of granitic rocks, the passage from a liquid or pasty to a\r\nsolid and crystalline state must have been an extremely gradual process.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine so much insisted upon formerly, that crystalline rocks,\r\nsuch as granite, gneiss, mica-schist, quartzite, and others were\r\nproduced in the greatest abundance in the earlier ages of the planet,\r\nand that their formation has ceased altogether in our own times, will be\r\ncontroverted in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n_Gradual development of subterranean movements._--The extreme violence\r\nof the subterranean forces in remote ages has been often inferred from\r\nthe facts that the older rocks are more fractured and dislocated than\r\nthe newer. But what other result could we have anticipated if the\r\nquantity of movement had been always equal in equal periods of time?\r\nTime must, in that case, multiply the derangement of strata in the ratio\r\nof their antiquity. Indeed the numerous exceptions to the above rule\r\nwhich we find in nature, present at first sight the only objection to\r\nthe hypothesis of uniformity. For the more ancient formations remain in\r\nmany places horizontal, while in others much newer strata are curved and\r\nvertical. This apparent anomaly, however, will be seen in the next\r\nchapter to depend on the irregular manner in which the volcanic and\r\nsubterranean agency affect different parts of the earth in succession,\r\nbeing often renewed again and again in certain areas, while others\r\nremain during the whole time at rest.\r\n\r\nThat the more impressive effects of subterranean power, such as the\r\nupheaval of mountain-chains, may have been due to multiplied convulsions\r\nof moderate intensity rather than to a few paroxysmal explosions, will\r\nappear the less improbable when the gradual and intermittent development\r\nof volcanic eruptions in times past is once established. It is now very\r\ngenerally conceded that these eruptions have their source in the same\r\ncauses as those which give rise to the permanent elevation and sinking\r\nof land; the admission, therefore, that one of the two volcanic or\r\nsubterranean processes has gone on gradually, draws with it the\r\nconclusion that the effects of the other have been elaborated by\r\nsuccessive and gradual efforts.\r\n\r\n_Faults._--The same reasoning is applicable to great _faults_, or those\r\nstriking instances of the upthrow or downthrow of large masses of rock,\r\nwhich have been thought by some to imply tremendous catastrophes wholly\r\nforeign to the ordinary course of nature. Thus we have in England\r\nfaults, in which the vertical displacement is between 600 and 3000 feet,\r\nand the horizontal extent thirty miles or more, the width of the\r\nfissures since filled up with rubbish varying from ten to fifty feet.\r\nBut when we inquire into the proofs of the mass having risen or fallen\r\nsuddenly on the one side of these great rents, several hundreds or\r\nthousands of feet above or below the rock with which it was once\r\ncontinuous on the other side, we find the evidence defective. There are\r\ngrooves, it is said, and scratches on the rubbed and polished walls,\r\nwhich have often one common direction, favoring the theory that the\r\nmovement was accomplished by a single stroke, and not by a series of\r\ninterrupted movements. But, in fact, the striae are not always parallel\r\nin such cases, but often irregular, and sometimes the stones and earth\r\nwhich are in the middle of the fault, or fissure, have been polished and\r\nstriated by friction in different directions, showing that there have\r\nbeen slidings subsequent to the first introduction of the fragmentary\r\nmatter. Nor should we forget that the last movement must always tend to\r\nobliterate the signs of previous trituration, so that neither its\r\ninstantaneousness nor the uniformity of its direction can be inferred\r\nfrom the parallelism of the striae that have been last produced.\r\n\r\nWhen rocks have been once fractured, and freedom of motion communicated\r\nto detached portions of them, these will naturally continue to yield in\r\nthe same direction, if the process of upheaval or of undermining be\r\nrepeated again and again. The incumbent mass will always give way along\r\nthe lines of least resistance, or where it was formerly rent asunder.\r\nProbably, the effects of reiterated movement, whether upward or\r\ndownward, in a fault, may be undistinguishable from those of a single\r\nand instantaneous rise or subsidence; and the same may be said of the\r\nrising or falling of continental masses, such as Sweden or Greenland,\r\nwhich we know to take place slowly and insensibly.\r\n\r\n_Doctrine of the sudden upheaval of parallel mountain-chains._--The\r\ndoctrine of the suddenness of many former revolutions in the physical\r\ngeography of the globe has been thought by some to derive additional\r\nconfirmation from a theory respecting the origin of mountain-chains,\r\nadvanced in 1833 by a distinguished geologist, M. Elie de Beaumont. In\r\nseveral essays on this subject, the last published in 1852, he has\r\nattempted to establish two points; first, that a variety of independent\r\nchains of mountains have been thrown up suddenly at particular periods;\r\nand, secondly, that the contemporaneous chains thus thrown up, preserve\r\na parallelism the one to the other.\r\n\r\nThese opinions, and others by which they are accompanied, are so adverse\r\nto the method of interpreting the history of geological changes which I\r\nhave recommended in this work, that I am desirous of explaining the\r\ngrounds of my dissent, a course which I feel myself the more called upon\r\nto adopt, as the generalizations alluded to are those of a skilful\r\nwriter, and an original observer of great talent and experience. I shall\r\nbegin, therefore, by giving a brief summary of the principal\r\npropositions laid down in the works above referred to.[242]\r\n\r\n1st. M. de Beaumont supposes \"that in the history of the earth there\r\nhave been long periods of comparative repose, during which the\r\ndeposition of sedimentary matter has gone on in regular continuity; and\r\nthere have also been short periods of paroxysmal violence, during which\r\nthat continuity was broken.\r\n\r\n\"2dly. At each of these periods of violence or 'revolution,' in the\r\nstate of the earth's surface, a great number of mountain-chains have\r\nbeen formed suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"3dly. The chains thrown up by a particular revolution have one uniform\r\ndirection, being parallel to each other within a few degrees of the\r\ncompass, even when situated in remote regions; whilst the chains thrown\r\nup at different periods have, for the most part, different directions.\r\n\r\n\"4thly. Each 'revolution,' or 'great convulsion,' has fallen in with the\r\ndate of another geological phenomenon; namely, 'the passage from one\r\nindependent sedimentary formation to another,' characterized by a\r\nconsiderable difference in 'organic types.'\r\n\r\n\"5thly. There has been a recurrence of these paroxysmal movements from\r\nthe remotest geological periods; and they may still be reproduced, and\r\nthe repose in which we live may hereafter be broken by the sudden\r\nupthrow of another system of parallel chains of mountains.\r\n\r\n\"6thly. The origin of these chains depends not on partial volcanic\r\naction, or a reiteration of ordinary earthquakes, but on the secular\r\nrefrigeration of the entire planet. For the whole globe, with the\r\nexception of a thin envelope, much thinner in proportion than the shell\r\nto an egg, is a fused mass, kept fluid by heat, but constantly cooling\r\nand contracting its dimensions. The external crust does not gradually\r\ncollapse and accommodate itself century after century to the shrunken\r\nnucleus, subsiding as often as there is a slight failure of support, but\r\nit is sustained throughout whole geological periods, so as to become\r\npartially separated from the nucleus, until at last it gives way\r\nsuddenly, cracking and falling in along determinate lines of fracture.\r\nDuring such a crisis the rocks are subjected to great lateral pressure,\r\nthe unyielding ones are crushed, and the pliant strata bent, and are\r\nforced to pack themselves more closely into a smaller space, having no\r\nlonger the same room to spread themselves out horizontally. At the same\r\ntime, a large portion of the mass is squeezed upwards, because it is in\r\nthe upward direction only that the excess in size of the envelope, as\r\ncompared to the contracted nucleus, can find relief. This excess\r\nproduces one or more of those folds or wrinkles in the earth's crust\r\nwhich we call mountain-chains.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, some chains are comparatively modern; such as the Alps, which\r\nwere partly upheaved after the middle tertiary period. The elevation of\r\nthe Andes was much more recent, and was accompanied by the simultaneous\r\noutburst for the first time of 270 of the principal volcanoes now\r\nactive.[243]\r\n\r\n\"The agitation of the waters of the ocean caused by this convulsion\r\nprobably occasioned that transient and general deluge which is noticed\r\nin the traditions of so many nations.\"[244]\r\n\r\nSeveral of the topics enumerated in the above summary, such as the cause\r\nof interruptions in the sedimentary series, will be discussed in the\r\nthirteenth chapter, and I shall now confine myself to what I conceive to\r\nbe the insufficiency of the proofs adduced in favor of the suddenness of\r\nthe upthrow, and the contemporaneousness of the origin of the parallel\r\nchains referred to. At the same time I may remark, that the great body\r\nof facts collected together by M. de Beaumont will always form a most\r\nvaluable addition to our knowledge, tending as they do to confirm the\r\ndoctrine that different mountain-chains have been formed in succession,\r\nand, as Werner first pointed out, that there are certain determinate\r\nlines of direction or strike in the strata of various countries.\r\n\r\nThe following may serve as an analysis of the evidence on which the\r\ntheory above stated depends. \"We observe,\" says M. de Beaumont, \"when we\r\nattentively examine nearly all mountain-chains, that the most recent\r\nrocks extend horizontally up to the foot of such chains, as we should\r\nexpect would be the case if they were deposited in seas or lakes, of\r\nwhich these mountains have partly formed the shores; whilst the other\r\nsedimentary beds, tilted up, and more or less contorted, on the flanks\r\nof the mountains, rise in certain points even to their highest\r\ncrests.\"[245] There are, therefore, in and adjacent to each chain, two\r\nclasses of sedimentary rocks, the ancient and inclined beds, and the\r\nnewer or horizontal. It is evident that the first appearance of the\r\nchain itself was an event \"intermediate between the period when the beds\r\nnow upraised were deposited, and the period when the strata were\r\nproduced horizontally at its feet.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\nThus the chain A assumed its present position after the deposition of\r\nthe strata _b_, which have undergone great movements, and before the\r\ndeposition of the group _c_, in which the strata have not suffered\r\nderangement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\nIf we then discover another chain B, in which we find not only the\r\nformation _b_, but the group _c_ also, disturbed and thrown on its\r\nedges, we may infer that the latter chain is of subsequent date to A;\r\nfor B must have been elevated _after_ the deposition of _c_, and before\r\nthat of the group _d_; whereas A had originated _before_ the strata _c_\r\nwere formed.\r\n\r\nIt is then argued, that in order to ascertain whether other mountain\r\nranges are of contemporaneous date with A and B, or are referable to\r\n_distinct_ periods, we have only to inquire whether the inclined and\r\nundisturbed sets of strata in each range correspond with or differ from\r\nthose in the typical chain A and B.\r\n\r\nNow all this reasoning is perfectly correct, so long as the period of\r\ntime required for the deposition of the strata _b_ and _c_ is not made\r\nidentical in duration with the period of time during which the animals\r\nand plants found fossil in _b_ and _c_ may have flourished; for the\r\nlatter, that is to say, the duration of certain groups of species, may\r\nhave greatly exceeded, and probably did greatly exceed, the former, or\r\nthe time required for the accumulation of certain local deposits, such\r\nas _b_ and _c_ (figs. 11 and 12). In order, moreover, to render the\r\nreasoning correct, due latitude must be given to the term\r\ncontemporaneous; for this term must be understood to allude, not to a\r\nmoment of time, but to the interval, whether brief or protracted, which\r\nelapsed between two events, namely, between the accumulation of the\r\ninclined and that of the horizontal strata.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, no attempt has been made in the treatises under\r\nreview to avoid this manifest source of confusion, and hence the very\r\nterms of each proposition are equivocal; and the possible length of some\r\nof the intervals is so vast, that to affirm that all the chains raised\r\nin such intervals were _contemporaneous_ is an abuse of language.\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate this argument, I shall select the Pyrenees as an\r\nexample. Originally M. E. de Beaumont spoke of this range of mountains\r\nas having been uplifted suddenly (_a un seul jet_), but he has since\r\nconceded that in this chain, in spite of the general unity and\r\nsimplicity of its structure, six, if not seven, systems of dislocation\r\nof different dates can be recognized.[246] In reference, however, to the\r\nlatest, and by far the most important of these convulsions, the chain is\r\nsaid to have attained its present elevation at a certain epoch in the\r\nearth's history, namely, between the deposition of the chalk, or rocks\r\nof about that age, and that of certain tertiary formations \"as old as\r\nthe plastic clay;\" for the chalk is seen in vertical, curved, and\r\ndistorted beds on the flanks of the chain, as the beds _b_, fig. 11,\r\nwhile the tertiary formations rest upon them in horizontal strata at its\r\nbase, as _c_, ibid.\r\n\r\nThe proof, then, of the extreme suddenness of the convulsion is supposed\r\nto be the shortness of the time which intervened between the formation\r\nof the chalk and the origin of certain tertiary strata.[247] Even if the\r\ninterval were deducible within these limits, it might comprise an\r\nindefinite lapse of time. In strictness of reasoning, however, the\r\nauthor cannot exclude the Cretaceous or Tertiary periods from the\r\npossible duration of the interval during which the elevation may have\r\ntaken place. For, in the first place, it cannot be assumed that the\r\nmovement of upheaval took place after the close of the Cretaceous\r\nperiod; we can merely say, that it occurred after the deposition of\r\ncertain strata of that period; secondly, although it were true that the\r\nevent happened before the formation of all the tertiary strata now at\r\nthe base of the Pyrenees, it would by no means follow that it preceded\r\nthe whole Tertiary epoch.\r\n\r\nThe age of the strata, both of the inclined and horizontal series, may\r\nhave been accurately determined by M. De Beaumont, and still the\r\nupheaving of the Pyrenees may have been going on before the animals of\r\nthe Chalk period, such as are found fossil in England, had ceased to\r\nexist, or when the Maestricht beds were in progress, or during the\r\nindefinite ages which may have elapsed between the extinction of the\r\nMaestricht animals and the introduction of the Eocene tribes, or during\r\nthe Eocene epoch, or the rise may have been going on throughout one, or\r\nseveral, or all of these periods.\r\n\r\nIt would be a purely gratuitous assumption to say that the inclined\r\ncretaceous strata (_b_, fig. 11) on the flanks of the Pyrenees, were the\r\nvery last which were deposited during the Cretaceous period, or that, as\r\nsoon as they were upheaved, all or nearly all the species of animals and\r\nplants now found fossil in them were suddenly exterminated; yet, unless\r\nthis can be affirmed, we cannot say that the Pyrenees were not upheaved\r\nduring the Cretaceous period. Consequently, another range of mountains,\r\nat the base of which cretaceous rocks may lie in horizontal\r\nstratification, may have been elevated, like the chain A, fig. 12,\r\nduring some part of the same great period.\r\n\r\nThere are mountains in Sicily two or three thousand feet high, the tops\r\nof which are composed of limestone, in which a large proportion of the\r\nfossil shells agree specifically with those now inhabiting the\r\nMediterranean. Here, as in many other countries, the deposits now in\r\nprogress in the sea must inclose shells and other fossils specifically\r\nidentical with those of the rocks constituting the contiguous land. So\r\nthere are islands in the Pacific where a mass of dead coral has emerged\r\nto a considerable altitude, while other portions of the mass remain\r\nbeneath the sea, still increasing by the growth of living zoophytes and\r\nshells. The chalk of the Pyrenees, therefore, may at a remote period\r\nhave been raised to an elevation of several thousand feet, while the\r\nspecies found fossil in the same chalk still continued to be represented\r\nin the fauna of the neighboring ocean. In a word, we cannot assume that\r\nthe origin of a new range of mountains caused the Cretaceous period to\r\ncease, and served as the prelude to a new order of things in the animate\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the grave objections above advanced, against the theory\r\nconsidered in the present chapter, let us suppose, that in some country\r\nthree styles of architecture had prevailed in succession, each for a\r\nperiod of one thousand years; first the Greek, then the Roman, and then\r\nthe Gothic; and that a tremendous earthquake was known to have occurred\r\nin the same district during one of the three periods--a convulsion of\r\nsuch violence as to have levelled to the ground all the buildings then\r\nstanding. If an antiquary, desirous of discovering the date of the\r\ncatastrophe, should first arrive at a city where several Greek temples\r\nwere lying in ruins and half engulphed in the earth, while many Gothic\r\nedifices were standing uninjured, could he determine on these data the\r\nera of the shock? Could he even exclude any one of the three periods,\r\nand decide that it must have happened during one of the other two?\r\nCertainly not. He could merely affirm that it happened at some period\r\nafter the introduction of the Greek style, and before the Gothic had\r\nfallen into disuse. Should he pretend to define the date of the\r\nconvulsion with greater precision, and decide that the earthquake must\r\nhave occurred after the Greek and before the Gothic period, that is to\r\nsay, when the Roman style was in use, the fallacy in his reasoning would\r\nbe too palpable to escape detection for a moment.\r\n\r\nYet such is the nature of the erroneous induction which I am now\r\nexposing. For as, in the example above proposed, the erection of a\r\nparticular edifice is perfectly distinct from the period of architecture\r\nin which it may have been raised, so is the deposition of chalk, or any\r\nother set of strata, from the geological epochs characterized by certain\r\nfossils to which they may belong.\r\n\r\nIt is almost superfluous to enter into any farther analysis of the\r\ntheory of parallelism, because the whole force of the argument depends\r\non the accuracy of the data by which the contemporaneous or\r\nnon-contemporaneous date of the elevation of two independent chains can\r\nbe demonstrated. In every case, this evidence, as stated by M. de\r\nBeaumont, is equivocal, because he has not included in the possible\r\ninterval of time between the depositions of the deranged and the\r\nhorizontal formations, part of the periods to which each of those\r\nclasses of formations are referable. Even if all the geological facts,\r\ntherefore, adduced by the author were true and unquestionable, yet the\r\nconclusion that certain chains were or were not simultaneously upraised\r\nis by no means a legitimate consequence.\r\n\r\nIn the third volume of my first edition of the Principles, which\r\nappeared in April, 1833, I controverted the views of M. de Beaumont,\r\nthen just published, in the same terms as I have now restated them. At\r\nthat time I took for granted that the chronological date of the newest\r\nrocks entering into the disturbed series of the Pyrenees had been\r\ncorrectly ascertained. It now appears, however, that some of the most\r\nmodern of those disturbed strata belong to the nummulitic formation,\r\nwhich are regarded by the majority of geologists as Eocene or older\r\ntertiary, an opinion not assented to by M. E. de Beaumont, and which I\r\ncannot discuss here without being led into too long a digression.[248]\r\n\r\nPerhaps a more striking illustration of the difficulties we encounter,\r\nwhen we attempt to apply the theory under consideration even to the best\r\nknown European countries, is afforded by what is called \"The System of\r\nthe Longmynds.\" This small chain, situated in Shropshire, is the third\r\nof the typical systems to which M. E. de Beaumont compares other\r\nmountain ranges corresponding in _strike_ and structure. The date\r\nassigned to its upheaval is \"after the unfossiliferous greywacke, or\r\nCambrian strata, and before the Silurian.\" But Sir R. I. Murchison had\r\nshown in 1838, in his \"Silurian System,\" and the British government\r\nsurveyors, since that time, in their sections (about 1845), that the\r\nLongmynds and other chains of similar composition in North Wales are\r\n_post-Silurian_. In all of them fossiliferous beds of the lower Silurian\r\nformation, or Llandeilo flags are highly inclined, and often vertical.\r\nIn one limited region the Caradoc sandstone, a member of the lower\r\nSilurian, rests unconformably on the denuded edges of the inferior (or\r\nLlandeilo) member of the same group; whilst in some cases both of these\r\nsets of strata are upturned. When, therefore, so grave an error is\r\ndetected in regard to the age of a typical chain, we are entitled to\r\ninquire with surprise, by what means nine other _parallel_ chains in\r\nFrance, Germany, and Sweden, assumed to be \"ante-Silurian,\" have been\r\nmade to agree precisely in date with the Longmynds? If they are\r\ncorrectly represented as having been all deposited before the deposition\r\nof the Silurian strata, they cannot be contemporaneous with the\r\nLongmynds, and they only prove how little reliance can be placed on\r\nparallelism as a test of simultaneousness of upheaval. But in truth it\r\nis impossible, for reasons already given, to demonstrate that each of\r\nthose nine chains coincide in date with one another, any more than with\r\nthe Longmynds.\r\n\r\nThe reader will see in the sequel (chap. 31[249]) that Mr. Hopkins has\r\ninferred from astronomical calculations, that the solid crust of the\r\nearth cannot be less than 800 or 1000 miles thick, and may be more. Even\r\nif it be solid to the depth of 100 miles, such a thickness would be\r\ninconsistent with M. E. de Beaumont's hypothesis, which requires a shell\r\nnot more than thirty miles thick, or even less. Mr. Hopkins admits that\r\nthe exterior of the planet, though solid as a whole, may contain within\r\nit vast lakes or seas of lava. If so, the gradual fusion of rocks, and\r\nthe expansive power of heat exerted for ages, as well as the subsequent\r\ncontraction of the same during slow refrigeration, may perhaps account\r\nfor the origin of mountain-chains, for these, as Dolomieu has remarked,\r\nare \"far less important, proportionally speaking, than the inequalities\r\non the surface of an egg-shell, which to the eye appears smooth.\" A\r\n\"centripetal force\" affecting the whole planet as it cools, seems a\r\nmightier cause than is required to produce wrinkles of such\r\ninsignificant size.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing his investigations, M. E. de Beaumont has of late greatly\r\nmultiplied the number of successive periods of instantaneous upheaval,\r\nadmitting at the same time that occasionally new lines of upthrow have\r\ntaken the direction of older ones.[250] These admissions render his\r\nviews much more in harmony with the principles advocated in this work,\r\nbut they impair the practical utility of parallelism considered as a\r\nchronological test; for no rule is laid down for limiting the interval,\r\nwhether in time or space, which may separate two parallel lines of\r\nupheaval of different dates.[251]\r\n\r\nAmong the various propositions above laid down (p. 164), it will be\r\nseen that the sudden rise of the Andes is spoken of as a modern event,\r\nbut Mr. Darwin has brought together ample data in proof of the local\r\npersistency of volcanic action throughout a long succession of\r\ngeological periods, beginning with times antecedent to the deposition of\r\nthe oolitic and cretaceous formations of Chili, and continuing to the\r\nhistorical epoch. It appears that some of the parallel ridges which\r\ncompose the Cordilleras, instead of being contemporaneous, were\r\nsuccessively and slowly upheaved at widely different epochs. The whole\r\nrange, after twice subsiding some thousands of feet, was brought up\r\nagain by a slow movement in mass, during the era of the Eocene tertiary\r\nformations, after which the whole sank down once more several hundred\r\nfeet, to be again uplifted to its present level by a slow and often\r\ninterrupted movement.[252] In a portion of this latter period the\r\n\"Pampean mud\" was formed, in which the Megatherium mylodon and other\r\nextinct quadrupeds are buried. This mud contains in it recent species of\r\nshells, some of them proper to brackish water, and is believed by Mr.\r\nDarwin to be an estuary or delta deposit. M. A. d'Orbigny, however, has\r\nadvanced an hypothesis referred to by M. E. de Beaumont, that the\r\nagitation and displacement of the waters of the ocean, caused by the\r\nelevation of the Andes, gave rise to a deluge, of which this Pampean\r\nmud, which rises sometimes to the height of 12,000 feet, is the result\r\nand monument.[253]\r\n\r\nIn studying many chains of mountains, we find that the strike or line of\r\noutcrop of continuous sets of strata, and the general direction of the\r\nchain, may be far from rectilinear. Curves forming angles of 20 degrees\r\nor 30 degrees may be found in the same range as in the Alleghanies; just\r\nas trains of active volcanoes and the zones throughout which modern\r\nearthquakes occur are often linear, without running in straight lines.\r\nNor are all of these, though contemporaneous or belonging to our own\r\nepoch, by any means parallel, but some at right angles, the one to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n_Slow upheaval and subsidence._--Recent observations have disclosed to\r\nus the wonderful fact, that not only the west coast of South America,\r\nbut also other large areas, some of them several thousand miles in\r\ncircumference, such as Scandinavia, and certain archipelagoes in the\r\nPacific, are slowly and insensibly rising; while other regions, such as\r\nGreenland, and parts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, in which atolls\r\nor circular coral islands abound, are as gradually sinking. That all the\r\nexisting continents and submarine abysses may have originated in\r\nmovements of this kind, continued throughout incalculable periods of\r\ntime, is undeniable, and the denudation which the dry land appears\r\neverywhere to have suffered, favors the idea that it was raised from the\r\ndeep by a succession of upward movements, prolonged throughout\r\nindefinite periods. For the action of waves and currents on land slowly\r\nemerging from the deep, affords the only power by which we can conceive\r\nso many deep valleys and wide spaces to have been denuded as those which\r\nare unquestionably the effects of running water.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps it may be said that there is no analogy between the slow\r\nupheaval of broad plains or table-lands, and the manner in which we must\r\npresume all mountain-chains, with their inclined strata, to have\r\noriginated. It seems, however, that the Andes have been rising century\r\nafter century, at the rate of several feet, while the Pampas on the east\r\nhave been raised only a few inches in the same time. Crossing from the\r\nAtlantic to the Pacific, in a line passing through Mendoza, Mr. Darwin\r\ntraversed a plain 800 miles broad, the eastern part of which has emerged\r\nfrom beneath the sea at a very modern period. The slope from the\r\nAtlantic is at first very gentle, then greater, until the traveller\r\nfinds, on reaching Mendoza, that he has gained, almost insensibly, a\r\nheight of 4000 feet. The mountainous district then begins suddenly, and\r\nits breadth from Mendoza to the shores of the Pacific is 120 miles, the\r\naverage height of the principal chain being from 15,000 to 16,000 feet,\r\nwithout including some prominent peaks, which ascend much higher. Now\r\nall we require, to explain the origin of the principal inequalities of\r\nlevel here described, is to imagine, first, a zone of more violent\r\nmovement to the west of Mendoza, and, secondly, to the east of that\r\nplace, an upheaving force, which died away gradually as it approached\r\nthe Atlantic. In short, we are only called upon to conceive, that the\r\nregion of the Andes was pushed up four feet in the same period in which\r\nthe Pampas near Mendoza rose one foot, and the plains near the shores of\r\nthe Atlantic one inch. In Europe we have learnt that the land at the\r\nNorth Cape ascends about five feet in a century, while farther to the\r\nsouth the movements diminish in quantity first to a foot, and then, at\r\nStockholm, to three inches in a century, while at certain points still\r\nfarther south there is no movement.\r\n\r\nBut in what manner, it is asked, can we account for the great lateral\r\npressure which has been exerted not only in the Andes, Alps, and other\r\nchains, but also on the strata of many low and nearly level countries?\r\nDo not the folding and fracture of the beds, the anticlinal and\r\nsynclinal ridges and troughs, as they are called, and the vertical, and\r\neven sometimes the inverted position of the beds, imply an abruptness\r\nand intensity in the disturbing force wholly different in kind and\r\nenergy to that which now rends the rocks during ordinary earthquakes? I\r\nshall treat more fully in the sequel (end of chap. 32) of the probable\r\nsubterranean sources, whether of upward or downward movement, and of\r\ngreat lateral pressure; but it may be well briefly to state in this\r\nplace that in our own times, as, for example, in Chili, in 1822, the\r\nvolcanic force has overcome the resistance, and permanently uplifted a\r\ncountry of such vast extent that the weight and volume of the Andes must\r\nbe insignificant in comparison, even if we indulge the most moderate\r\nconjectures as to the thickness of the earth's crust above the volcanic\r\nfoci.\r\n\r\nTo assume that any set of strata with which we are acquainted are made\r\nup of such cohesive and unyielding materials, as to be able to resist a\r\npower of such stupendous energy, if its direction, instead of being\r\nvertical, happened to be oblique or horizontal, would be extremely rash.\r\nBut if they could yield to a sideway thrust, even in a slight degree,\r\nthey would become squeezed and folded to any amount if subjected for a\r\nsufficient number of times to the repeated action of the same force. We\r\ncan scarcely doubt that a mass of rock several miles thick was uplifted\r\nin Chili in 1822 and 1835, and that a much greater volume of solid\r\nmatter is upheaved wherever the rise of the land is very gradual, as in\r\nScandinavia, the development of heat being probably, in that region, at\r\na greater distance from the surface. If continents, rocked, shaken, and\r\nfissured, like the western region of South America, or very gently\r\nelevated, like Norway and Sweden, do not acquire in a few days or hours\r\nan additional height of several thousand feet, this can arise from no\r\nlack of mechanical force in the subterranean moving cause, but simply\r\nbecause the antagonist power, or the strength, toughness, and density of\r\nthe earth's crust is insufficient to resist, so long, as to allow the\r\nvolcanic energy an indefinite time to accumulate. Instead of the\r\nexplosive charge augmenting in quantity for countless ages, it finds\r\nrelief continuously, or by a succession of shocks of moderate violence,\r\nso as never to burst or blow up the covering of incumbent rock in one\r\ngrand paroxysmal convulsion. Even in its most energetic efforts it\r\ndisplays an intermittent and mitigated intensity, being never permitted\r\nto lay a whole continent in ruins. Hence the numerous eruptions of lava\r\nfrom the same vent, or chain of vents, and the recurrence of similar\r\nearthquakes for thousands of years along certain areas or zones of\r\ncountry. Hence the numerous monuments of the successive ejection and\r\ninjection of melted matter in ancient geological epochs, and the\r\nfissures formed in distinct ages, and often widened and filled at\r\ndifferent eras.\r\n\r\nAmong the causes of lateral pressure, the expansion by heat of large\r\nmasses of solid stone intervening between others which have a different\r\ndegree of expansibility, or which happen not to have their temperature\r\nraised at the same time, may play an important part. But as we know that\r\nrocks have so often sunk down thousands of feet below their original\r\nlevel, we can hardly doubt that much of the bending of pliant strata,\r\nand the packing of the same into smaller spaces, has frequently been\r\noccasioned by subsidence. Whether the failure of support be produced by\r\nthe melting of porous rocks, which, when fluid, and subjected to great\r\npressure, may occupy less room than before, or which, by passing from a\r\npasty to a crystalline condition, may, as in the case of granite,\r\naccording to the experiments of Deville, suffer a contraction of 10 per\r\ncent., or whether the sinking be due to the subtraction of lava driven\r\nelsewhere to some volcanic orifice, and there forced outwards, or\r\nwhether it be brought on by the shrinking of solid and stony masses\r\nduring refrigeration, or by the condensation of gases, or any other\r\nimaginable cause, we have no reason to incline to the idea that the\r\nconsequent geological changes are brought about so suddenly, as that\r\nlarge parts of continents are swallowed up at once in unfathomable\r\nsubterranean abysses. If cavities be formed, they will be enlarged\r\ngradually, and as gradually filled. We read, indeed, accounts of\r\nengulphed cities and areas of limited extent which have sunk down many\r\nyards at once; but we have as yet no authentic records of the sudden\r\ndisappearance of mountains, or the submergence or emergence of great\r\nislands. On the other hand, the creeps in coal mines[254] demonstrate\r\nthat gravitation begins to act as soon as a moderate quantity of matter\r\nis removed even at a great depth. The roof sinks in, or the floor of the\r\nmine rises, and the bent strata often assume as regularly a curved and\r\ncrumpled arrangement as that observed on a grander scale in\r\nmountain-chains. The absence, indeed, of chaotic disorder, and the\r\nregularity of the plications in geological formations of high antiquity,\r\nalthough not unfrequently adduced to prove the unity and\r\ninstantaneousness of the disturbing force, might with far greater\r\npropriety be brought forward as an argument in favor of the successive\r\napplication of some irresistible but moderated force, such as that which\r\ncan elevate or depress a continent.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I may observe that one of the soundest objections to the\r\ntheory of the sudden upthrow or downthrow of mountain-chains is this,\r\nthat it provides us with too much force of one kind, namely, that of\r\nsubterranean movement, while it deprives us of another kind of\r\nmechanical force, namely, that exerted by the waves and currents of the\r\nocean, which the geologist requires for the denudation of land during\r\nits slow upheaval or depression. It may be safely affirmed that the\r\nquantity of igneous and aqueous action,--of volcanic eruption and\r\ndenudation,--of subterranean movement and sedimentary deposition,--not\r\nonly of past ages, but of one geological epoch, or even the fraction of\r\nan epoch, has exceeded immeasurably all the fluctuations of the\r\ninorganic world which have been witnessed by man. But we have still to\r\ninquire whether the time to which each chapter or page or paragraph of\r\nthe earth's autobiography relates, was not equally immense when\r\ncontrasted with a brief era of 3000 or 5000 years. The real point on\r\nwhich the whole controversy turns, is the relative amount of work done\r\nby mechanical force in given quantities of time, past and present.\r\nBefore we can determine the relative intensity of the force employed, we\r\nmust have some fixed standard by which to measure the time expended in\r\nits development at two distinct periods. It is not the magnitude of the\r\neffects, however gigantic their proportions, which can inform us in the\r\nslightest degree whether the operation was sudden or gradual, insensible\r\nor paroxysmal. It must be shown that a slow process could never in any\r\nseries of ages give rise to the same results.\r\n\r\nThe advocate of paroxysmal energy might assume a uniform and fixed rate\r\nof variation in times past and present for the animate world, that is to\r\nsay, for the dying-out and coming-in of species, and then endeavor to\r\nprove that the changes of the inanimate world have not gone on in a\r\ncorresponding ratio. But the adoption of such a standard of comparison\r\nwould lead, I suspect, to a theory by no means favorable to the pristine\r\nintensity of natural causes. That the present state of the organic world\r\nis not stationary, can be fairly inferred from the fact, that some\r\nspecies are known to have become extinct in the course even of the last\r\nthree centuries, and that the exterminating causes always in activity,\r\nboth on the land and in the waters, are very numerous; also, because man\r\nhimself is an extremely modern creation; and we may therefore reasonably\r\nsuppose that some of the mammalia now contemporary with man, as well as\r\na variety of species of inferior classes, may have been recently\r\nintroduced into the earth, to supply the places of plants and animals\r\nwhich have from time to time disappeared. But granting that some such\r\nsecular variation in the zoological and botanical worlds is going on,\r\nand is by no means wholly inappreciable to the naturalist, still it is\r\ncertainly far less manifest than the revolution always in progress in\r\nthe inorganic world. Every year some volcanic eruptions take place, and\r\na rude estimate might be made of the number of cubic feet of lava and\r\nscoriae poured or cast out of various craters. The amount of mud and sand\r\ndeposited in deltas, and the advance of new land upon the sea, or the\r\nannual retreat of wasting sea-cliffs, are changes the minimum amount of\r\nwhich might be roughly estimated. The quantity of land raised above or\r\ndepressed below the level of the sea might also be computed, and the\r\nchange arising from such movements in a century might be conjectured.\r\nSuppose the average rise of the land in some parts of Scandinavia to be\r\nas much as five feet in a hundred years, the present sea-coast might be\r\nuplifted 700 feet in fourteen thousand years; but we should have no\r\nreason to anticipate, from any zoological data hitherto acquired, that\r\nthe molluscous fauna of the northern seas would in that lapse of years\r\nundergo any sensible amount of variation. We discover sea-beaches in\r\nNorway 700 feet high, in which the shells are identical with those now\r\ninhabiting the German Ocean; for the rise of land in Scandinavia,\r\nhowever insensible to the inhabitants, has evidently been rapid when\r\ncompared to the rate of contemporaneous change in the testaceous fauna\r\nof the German Ocean. Were we to wait therefore until the mollusca shall\r\nhave undergone as much fluctuation as they underwent between the period\r\nof the Lias and the Upper Oolite formations; or between the Oolite and\r\nChalk, nay, even between any two of eight subdivisions of the Eocene\r\nseries, what stupendous revolutions in physical geography ought we not\r\nto expect, and how many mountain-chains might not be produced by the\r\nrepetition of shocks of moderate violence, or by movements not even\r\nperceptible by man!\r\n\r\nOr, if we turn from the mollusca to the vegetable kingdom, and ask the\r\nbotanist how many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions might be expected,\r\nand how much the relative level of land and sea might be altered, or how\r\nfar the principal deltas will encroach upon the ocean, or the sea-cliffs\r\nrecede from the present shores, before the species of European\r\nforest-trees will die out, he would reply that such alterations in the\r\ninanimate world might be multiplied indefinitely before he should have\r\nreason to anticipate, by reference to any known data, that the existing\r\nspecies of trees in our forests would disappear and give place to\r\nothers. In a word, the movement of the inorganic world is obvious and\r\npalpable, and might be likened to the minute-hand of a clock, the\r\nprogress of which can be seen and heard, whereas the fluctuations of the\r\nliving creation are nearly invisible, and resemble the motion of the\r\nhour-hand of a timepiece. It is only by watching it attentively for some\r\ntime, and comparing its relative position after an interval, that we can\r\nprove the reality of its motion.[255]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCE IN TEXTURE OF THE OLDER AND NEWER ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Consolidation of fossiliferous strata--Some deposits originally\r\n    solid--Transition and slaty texture--Crystalline character of\r\n    Plutonic and Metamorphic rocks--Theory of their origin--Essentially\r\n    subterranean--No proofs that they were produced more abundantly at\r\n    remote periods.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother argument in favor of the dissimilarity of the causes operating\r\nat remote and recent eras has been derived by many geologists from the\r\nmore compact, stony, and crystalline texture of the older as compared\r\nwith the newer rocks.\r\n\r\n_Consolidation of strata._--This subject may be considered, first in\r\nreference to the fossiliferous strata; and, secondly, in reference to\r\nthose crystalline and stratified rocks which contain no organic remains,\r\nsuch as gneiss and mica-schist. There can be no doubt that the former of\r\nthese classes, or the fossiliferous, are generally more compact and\r\nstony in proportion as they are more ancient. It is also certain that a\r\ngreat part of them were originally in a soft and incoherent state, and\r\nthat they have been since consolidated. Thus we find occasionally that\r\nshingle and sand have been agglutinated firmly together by a ferruginous\r\nor siliceous cement, or that lime in solution has been introduced, so as\r\nto bind together materials previously incoherent. Organic remains have\r\nsometimes suffered a singular transformation, as for example,] where\r\nshells, corals, and wood are silicified, their calcareous or ligneous\r\nmatter having been replaced by nearly pure silica. The constituents of\r\nsome beds have probably set and become hard for the first time when they\r\nemerged from beneath the water.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, we observe in certain formations now in\r\nprogress, particularly in coral reefs, and in deposits from the waters\r\nof mineral springs, both calcareous and siliceous, that the texture of\r\nrocks may sometimes be stony from the first. This circumstance may\r\naccount for exceptions to the general rule, not unfrequently met with,\r\nwhere solid strata are superimposed on others of a plastic and\r\nincoherent nature, as in the neighborhood of Paris, where the tertiary\r\nformations, consisting often of compact limestone and siliceous grit,\r\nare more stony than the subjacent chalk.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be understood, that the various solidifying causes,\r\nincluding those above enumerated, together with the pressure of\r\nincumbent rocks and the influence of subterranean heat, must all of them\r\nrequire time in order to exert their full power. If in the course of\r\nages they modify the aspect and internal structure of stratified\r\ndeposits, they will give rise to a general distinctness of character in\r\nthe older as contrasted with the newer formations. But this distinctness\r\nwill not be the consequence of any original diversity; they will be\r\nunlike, just as the wood in the older trees of a forest usually differs\r\nin texture and hardness from that of younger individuals of the same\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n_Transition texture_.--In the original classification, of Werner, the\r\nhighly crystalline rocks, such as granite and gneiss, which contain no\r\norganic remains, were called primary, and the fossiliferous strata\r\nsecondary, while to another class of an age intermediate between the\r\nprimary and secondary he gave the name of transition. They were termed\r\ntransition because they partook in some degree in their mineral\r\ncomposition of the nature of the most crystalline rocks, such as gneiss\r\nand mica-schist, while they resembled the fossiliferous series in\r\ncontaining occasionally organic remains, and exhibiting evident signs of\r\na mechanical origin. It was at first imagined, that the rocks having\r\nthis intermediate texture had been all deposited subsequently to the\r\nseries called primary, and before all the more earthy and fossiliferous\r\nformations. But when the relative position and organic remains of these\r\ntransition rocks were better understood, it was perceived that they did\r\nnot all belong to one period. On the contrary, the same mineral\r\ncharacters were found in strata of very different ages, and some\r\nformations occurring in the Alps, which several of the ablest scholars\r\nof Werner had determined to be transition, were ultimately ascertained,\r\nby means of their fossil contents and position, to be members of the\r\nCretaceous, and even of the nummulitic or Eocene period. These strata\r\nhad, in fact, acquired the _transition_ texture from the influence of\r\ncauses which, since their deposition had modified their internal\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n_Texture and origin of Plutonic and metamorphic rocks_.--Among the most\r\nsingular of the changes superinduced on rocks, we have occasionally to\r\ninclude the slaty texture, the divisional planes of which sometimes\r\nintersect the true planes of stratification, and even pass directly\r\nthrough imbedded fossils. If, then, the crystalline, the slaty, and\r\nother modes of arrangement, once deemed characteristic of certain\r\nperiods in the history of the earth, have in reality been assumed by\r\nfossiliferous rocks of different ages and at different times, we are\r\nprepared to inquire whether the same may not be true of the most highly\r\ncrystalline state, such as that of gneiss, mica-schist, and statuary\r\nmarble. That the peculiar characteristics of such rocks are really due\r\nto a variety of modifying causes has long been suspected by many\r\ngeologists, and the doctrine has gained ground of late, although a\r\nconsiderable difference of opinion still prevails. According to the\r\noriginal Neptunian theory, all the crystalline formations were\r\nprecipitated from a universal menstruum or chaotic fluid antecedently to\r\nthe creation of animals and plants, the unstratified granite having been\r\nfirst thrown down so as to serve as a floor or foundation on which\r\ngneiss and other stratified rocks might repose. Afterwards, when the\r\nigneous origin of granite was no longer disputed, many conceived that a\r\nthermal ocean enveloped the globe, at a time when the first-formed crust\r\nof granite was cooling, but when it still retained much of its heat. The\r\nhot waters of this ocean held in solution the ingredients of gneiss,\r\nmica-schist, hornblende-schist, clay-slate, and marble, rocks which were\r\nprecipitated, one after the other, in a crystalline form. No fossils\r\ncould be inclosed in them, the high temperature of the fluid and the\r\nquantity of mineral matter which it held in solution, rendering it unfit\r\nfor the support of organic beings.\r\n\r\nIt would be inconsistent with the plan of this work to enter here into a\r\ndetailed account of what I have elsewhere termed the _metamorphic\r\ntheory_;[256] but I may state that it is now demonstrable in some\r\ncountries that fossiliferous formations, some of them of the age of the\r\nSilurian strata, as near Christiana in Norway, others belonging to the\r\nOolitic period, as around Carrara in Italy, have been converted\r\npartially into gneiss, mica-schist, and statuary marble. The\r\ntransmutation has been effected apparently by the influence of\r\nsubterranean heat, acting under great pressure, or by chemical and\r\nelectrical causes operating in a manner not yet understood, and which\r\nhave been termed _Plutonic_ action, as expressing, in one word, all the\r\nmodifying causes which may be brought into play at great depths, and\r\nunder conditions never exemplified at the surface. To this Plutonic\r\naction the fusion of granite itself in the bowels of the earth, as well\r\nas the superinducement of the metamorphic texture into sedimentary\r\nstrata, must be attributed; and in accordance with these views the age\r\nof each metamorphic formation may be said to be twofold, for we have\r\nfirst to consider the period when it originated, as an aqueous deposit,\r\nin the form of mud, sand, marl, or limestone; secondly, the date at\r\nwhich it acquired a crystalline texture. The same strata, therefore,\r\nmay, according to this view, be very ancient in reference to the time of\r\ntheir deposition, and very modern in regard to the period of their\r\nassuming the metamorphic character.\r\n\r\n_No proofs that these crystalline rocks were produced more abundantly at\r\nremote periods_.--Several modern writers, without denying the truth of\r\nthe Plutonic or metamorphic theory, still contend that the crystalline\r\nand non-fossiliferous formations, whether stratified or unstratified,\r\nsuch as gneiss and granite, are essentially ancient as a class of rocks.\r\nThey were generated, say they, most abundantly in the primeval state of\r\nthe globe, since which time the quantity produced has been always on the\r\ndecrease, until it became very inconsiderable in the Oolitic and\r\nCretaceous periods, and quite evanescent before the commencement of the\r\ntertiary epoch.\r\n\r\nNow the justness of these views depends almost entirely on the question\r\nwhether granite, gneiss, and other rocks of the same order ever\r\noriginated at the surface, or whether, according to the opinions above\r\nadopted, they are essentially subterranean in their origin, and\r\ntherefore entitled to the appellation of _hypogene_. If they were formed\r\nsuperficially in their present state, and as copiously in the modern as\r\nin the more ancient periods, we ought to see a greater abundance of\r\ntertiary and secondary than of primary granite and gneiss; but if we\r\nadopt the hypogene theory before explained, their rapid diminution in\r\nvolume among the visible rocks in the earth's crust in proportion as we\r\ninvestigate the formations of newer date, is quite intelligible. If a\r\nmelted mass of matter be now cooling very slowly at the depth of several\r\nmiles beneath the crater of an active volcano, it must remain invisible\r\nuntil great revolutions in the earth's crust have been brought about. So\r\nalso if stratified rocks have been subjected to Plutonic action, and\r\nafter having been baked or reduced to semi-fusion, are now cooling and\r\ncrystallizing far under ground, it will probably require the lapse of\r\nmany periods before they will be forced up to the surface and exposed to\r\nview, even at a single point. To effect this purpose there may be need\r\nof as great a development of subterranean movement as that which in the\r\nAlps, Andes, and Himalaya has raised marine strata containing ammonites\r\nto the height of 8000, 14,000, and 16,000 feet. By parity of reasoning\r\nwe can hardly expect that any hypogene rocks of the tertiary periods\r\nwill have been brought within the reach of human observation, seeing\r\nthat the emergence of such rocks must always be so long posterior to the\r\ndate of their origin, and still less can formations of this class become\r\ngenerally visible until so much time has elapsed as to confer on them a\r\nhigh relative antiquity. Extensive denudation must also combine with\r\nupheaval before they can be displayed at the surface throughout wide\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nAll geologists who reflect on subterranean movements now going on, and\r\nthe eruptions of active volcanoes, are convinced that great changes are\r\nnow continually in progress in the interior of the earth's crust far\r\nout of sight. They must be conscious, therefore, that the\r\ninaccessibility of the regions in which these alterations are taking\r\nplace, compels them to remain in ignorance of a great part of the\r\nworking of existing causes, so that they can only form vague conjectures\r\nin regard to the nature of the products which volcanic heat may\r\nelaborate under great pressure.\r\n\r\nBut when they find in mountain-chains of high antiquity, that what was\r\nonce the interior of the earth's crust has since been forced outwards\r\nand exposed to view, they will naturally expect in the examination of\r\nthose mountainous regions, to have an opportunity of gratifying their\r\ncuriosity by obtaining a sight not only of the superficial strata of\r\nremote eras, but also of the contemporaneous nether-formed rocks. Having\r\nrecognized, therefore, in such mountain-chains some ancient rocks of\r\naqueous and volcanic origin, corresponding in character to superficial\r\nformations of modern date, they will regard any other class of ancient\r\nrocks, such as granite and gneiss, as the _residual phenomena_ of which\r\nthey are in search. These latter rocks will not answer the expectations\r\npreviously formed of their probable nature and texture, unless they wear\r\na foreign and mysterious aspect, and have in some places been fused or\r\naltered by subterranean heat; in a word, unless they differ wholly from\r\nthe fossiliferous strata deposited at the surface, or from the lava and\r\nscoriae thrown out by volcanoes in the open air. It is the total\r\ndistinctness, therefore, of crystalline formations, such as granite,\r\nhornblende-schist, and the rest, from every substance of which the\r\norigin is familiar to us, that constitutes their claim to be regarded as\r\nthe effects of causes now in action in the subterranean regions. They\r\nbelong not to an order of things which has passed away; they are not the\r\nmonuments of a primeval period, bearing inscribed upon them in obsolete\r\ncharacters the words and phrases of a dead language; but they teach us\r\nthat part of the living language of nature, which we cannot learn by our\r\ndaily intercourse with what passes on the habitable surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nUNIFORMITY IN THE SERIES OF PAST CHANGES IN THE ANIMATE AND INANIMATE\r\nWORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Supposed alternate periods of repose and disorder--Observed facts in\r\n    which this doctrine has originated--These may be explained by\r\n    supposing a uniform and uninterrupted series of changes--Threefold\r\n    consideration of this subject; first, in reference to the living\r\n    creation, extinction of species, and origin of new animals and\r\n    plants; secondly, in reference to the changes produced in the\r\n    earth's crust by the continuance of subterranean movements in\r\n    certain areas, and their transference after long periods to new\r\n    areas; thirdly, in reference to the laws which govern the formation\r\n    of fossiliferous strata, and the shifting of the areas of\r\n    sedimentary deposition--On the combined influence of all these modes\r\n    and causes of change in producing breaks and chasms in the chain of\r\n    records--Concluding remarks on the identity of the ancient and\r\n    present system of terrestrial changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Origin of the doctrine of alternate periods of repose and\r\ndisorder._--It has been truly observed, that when we arrange the\r\nfossiliferous formations in chronological order, they constitute a\r\nbroken and defective series of monuments: we pass without any\r\nintermediate gradations, from systems of strata which are horizontal to\r\nother systems which are highly inclined, from rocks of peculiar mineral\r\ncomposition to others which have a character wholly distinct,--from one\r\nassemblage of organic remains to another, in which frequently all the\r\nspecies, and most of the genera, are different. These violations of\r\ncontinuity are so common, as to constitute the rule rather than the\r\nexception, and they have been considered by many geologists as\r\nconclusive in favor of sudden revolutions in the inanimate and animate\r\nworld. According to the speculations of some writers, there have been in\r\nthe past history of the planet alternate periods of tranquillity and\r\nconvulsion, the former enduring for ages, and resembling that state of\r\nthings now experienced by man: the other brief, transient, and\r\nparoxysmal, giving rise to new mountains, seas, and valleys,\r\nannihilating one set of organic beings, and ushering in the creation of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nIt will be the object of the present chapter to demonstrate, that these\r\ntheoretical views are not borne out by a fair interpretation of\r\ngeological monuments. It is true that in the solid framework of the\r\nglobe, we have a chronological chain of natural records, and that many\r\nlinks in this chain are wanting; but a careful consideration of all the\r\nphenomena will lead to the opinion that the series was originally\r\ndefective,--that it has been rendered still more so by time--that a\r\ngreat part of what remains is inaccessible to man, and even of that\r\nfraction which is accessible, nine-tenths are to this day unexplored.\r\n\r\n_How the facts may be explained by assuming a uniform series of\r\nchanges._--The readiest way, perhaps, of persuading the reader that we\r\nmay dispense with great and sudden revolutions in the geological order\r\nof events, is by showing him how a regular and uninterrupted series of\r\nchanges in the animate and inanimate world may give rise to such breaks\r\nin the sequence, and such unconformability of stratified rocks, as are\r\nusually thought to imply convulsions and catastrophes. It is scarcely\r\nnecessary to state, that the order of events thus assumed to occur, for\r\nthe sake of illustration, must be in harmony with all the conclusions\r\nlegitimately drawn by geologists from the structure of the earth, and\r\nmust be equally in accordance with the changes observed by man to be now\r\ngoing on in the living as well as in the inorganic creation. It may be\r\nnecessary in the present state of science to supply some part of the\r\nassumed course of nature hypothetically; but if so, this must be done\r\nwithout any violation of probability, and always consistently with the\r\nanalogy of what is known both of the past and present economy of our\r\nsystem. Although the discussion of so comprehensive a subject must carry\r\nthe beginner far beyond his depth, it will also, it is hoped, stimulate\r\nhis curiosity, and prepare him to read some elementary treatises on\r\ngeology with advantage, and teach him the bearing on that science of the\r\nchanges now in progress on the earth. At the same time it may enable him\r\nthe better to understand the intimate connection between the second and\r\nthird books of this work, the former of which is occupied with the\r\nchanges in the inorganic, the latter with those of the organic creation.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance, then, of the plan above proposed, I shall consider in this\r\nchapter, first, what may be the course of fluctuation in the animate\r\nworld; secondly, the mode in which contemporaneous subterranean\r\nmovements affect the earth's crust; and, thirdly, the laws which\r\nregulate the deposition of sediment.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNIFORMITY OF CHANGE CONSIDERED FIRST IN REFERENCE TO THE LIVING\r\nCREATION.\r\n\r\nFirst, in regard to the vicissitudes of the living creation, all are\r\nagreed that the sedimentary strata found in the earth's crust are\r\ndivisible into a variety of groups, more or less dissimilar in their\r\norganic remains and mineral composition. The conclusion universally\r\ndrawn from the study and comparison of these fossiliferous groups is\r\nthis, that at successive periods distinct tribes of animals and plants\r\nhave inhabited the land and waters, and that the organic types of the\r\nnewer formations are more analogous to species now existing, than those\r\nof more ancient rocks. If we then turn to the present state of the\r\nanimate creation, and inquire whether it has now become fixed and\r\nstationary, we discover that, on the contrary, it is in a state of\r\ncontinual flux--that there are many causes in action which tend to the\r\nextinction of species, and which are conclusive against the doctrine of\r\ntheir unlimited durability. But natural history has been successfully\r\ncultivated for so short a period, that a few examples only of local, and\r\nperhaps but one or two of absolute, extirpation can as yet be proved,\r\nand these only where the interference of man has been conspicuous. It\r\nwill nevertheless appear evident, from the facts and arguments detailed\r\nin the third book (from the thirty-seventh to the forty-second chapters,\r\ninclusive) that man is not the only exterminating agent; and that,\r\nindependently of his intervention, the annihilation of species is\r\npromoted by the multiplication and gradual diffusion of every animal or\r\nplant. It will also appear, that every alteration in the physical\r\ngeography and climate of the globe cannot fail to have the same\r\ntendency. If we proceed still farther, and inquire whether new species\r\nare substituted from time to time for those which die out, and whether\r\nthere are certain laws appointed by the Author of Nature to regulate\r\nsuch new creations, we find that the period of human observation is as\r\nyet too short to afford data for determining so weighty a question. All\r\nthat can be done is to show that the successive introduction of new\r\nspecies may be a constant part of the economy of the terrestrial system,\r\nwithout our having any right to expect that we should be in possession\r\nof direct proof of the fact. The appearance again and again of new\r\nspecies may easily have escaped detection, since the numbers of known\r\nanimals and plants have augmented so rapidly within the memory of\r\npersons now living, as to have doubled in some classes, and quadrupled\r\nin others. It will also be remarked in the sequel (book iii. chap. 43),\r\nthat it must always be more easy if species proceeded originally from\r\nsingle stocks, to prove that one which formerly abounded in a given\r\ndistrict has ceased to be, than that another has been called into being\r\nfor the first time. If, therefore, there be as yet only one or two\r\nunequivocal instances of extinction, namely, those of the dodo and\r\nsolitaire (see ch. 41), it is scarcely reasonable as yet to hope that we\r\nshould be cognizant of a single instance of the first appearance of a\r\nnew species.\r\n\r\n_Recent origin of man, and gradual approach in the tertiary fossils of\r\nsuccessive periods from an extinct to the recent fauna._--The geologist,\r\nhowever, if required to advance some fact which may lend countenance to\r\nthe opinion that in the most modern times, that is to say, after the\r\ngreater part of the existing fauna and flora were established on the\r\nearth, there has still been a new species superadded, may point to man\r\nhimself as furnishing the required illustration--for man must be\r\nregarded by the geologist as a creature of yesterday, not merely in\r\nreference to the past history of the organic world, but also in relation\r\nto that particular state of the animate creation of which he forms a\r\npart. The comparatively modern introduction of the human race is proved\r\nby the absence of the remains of man and his works, not only from all\r\nstrata containing a certain proportion of fossil shells of extinct\r\nspecies, but even from a large part of the newest strata, in which all\r\nthe fossil individuals are referable to species still living.\r\n\r\nTo enable the reader to appreciate the full force of this evidence, I\r\nshall give a slight sketch of the information obtained from the newer\r\nstrata, respecting fluctuations in the animate world, in times\r\nimmediately antecedent to the appearance of man.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the series of fossiliferous formations from the more ancient\r\nto the more modern, the first deposits in which we meet with assemblages\r\nof organic remains, having a near analogy to the fauna of certain parts\r\nof the globe in our own time, are those commonly called tertiary. Even\r\nin the Eocene, or oldest subdivision of these tertiary formations, some\r\nfew of the testacea belong to existing species, although almost all of\r\nthem, and apparently all the associated vertebrata, are now extinct.\r\nThese Eocene strata are succeeded by a great number of more modern\r\ndeposits, which depart gradually in the character of their fossils from\r\nthe Eocene type, and approach more and more to that of the living\r\ncreation. In the present state of science, it is chiefly by the aid of\r\nshells that we are enabled to arrive at these results, for of all\r\nclasses the testacea are the most generally diffused in a fossil state,\r\nand may be called the medals principally employed by nature, in\r\nrecording the chronology of past events. In the Miocene deposits, which\r\nare next in succession to the Eocene, we begin to find a considerable\r\nnumber, although still a minority, of recent species, intermixed with\r\nsome fossils common to the preceding epoch. We then arrive at the\r\nPliocene strata, in which species now contemporary with man begin to\r\npreponderate, and in the newest of which nine-tenths of the fossils\r\nagree with species still inhabiting the neighboring sea.\r\n\r\nIn this passing from the older to the newer members of the tertiary\r\nsystem we meet with many chasms, but none which separate entirely, by a\r\nbroad line of demarcation, one state of the organic world from another.\r\nThere are no signs of an abrupt termination of one fauna and flora, and\r\nthe starting into life of new and wholly distinct forms. Although we are\r\nfar from being able to demonstrate geologically an insensible transition\r\nfrom the Eocene to the Miocene, or even from the latter to the recent\r\nfauna, yet the more we enlarge and perfect our general survey, the more\r\nnearly do we approximate to such a continuous series, and the more\r\ngradually are we conducted from times when many of the genera and nearly\r\nall the species were extinct, to those in which scarcely a single\r\nspecies flourished which we do not know to exist at present. Dr. A.\r\nPhilippi, indeed, after an elaborate comparison of the fossil tertiary\r\nshells of Sicily with those now living in the Mediterranean, announces\r\nas the result of his examination that there are strata in that island,\r\nwhich attest a very gradual passage from a period, when only thirteen in\r\na hundred of the shells were like the species now living in the sea, to\r\nan era when the recent species had attained a proportion of ninety-five\r\nin a hundred. There is therefore evidence, he says, in Sicily of this\r\nrevolution in the animate world having been effected \"without the\r\nintervention of any convulsion or abrupt changes, certain species having\r\nfrom time to time died out, and others having been introduced, until at\r\nlength the existing fauna was elaborated.\"\r\n\r\nIt had often been objected that the evidence of fossil species occurring\r\nin two consecutive formations, was confined to the testacea or\r\nzoophytes, the characters of which are less marked and decisive than\r\nthose afforded by the vertebrate animals. But Mr. Owen has lately\r\ninsisted on the important fact, that not a few of the quadrupeds which\r\nnow inhabit our island, and among others the horse, the ass, the hog,\r\nthe smaller wild ox, the goat, the red deer, the roe, the beaver, and\r\nmany of the diminutive rodents, are the same as those which once\r\ncoexisted with the mammoth, the great northern hippopotamus, two kinds\r\nof rhinoceros, and other mammalia long since extinct. \"A part,\" he\r\nobserves, \"and not the whole of the modern tertiary fauna has perished,\r\nand hence we may conclude that the cause of their destruction has not\r\nbeen a violent and universal catastrophe from which none could\r\nescape.\"[257]\r\n\r\nHad we discovered evidence that man had come into the earth at a period\r\nas early as that when a large number of the fossil quadrupeds now\r\nliving, and almost all the recent species of land, freshwater, and\r\nmarine shells were in existence, we should have been compelled to\r\nascribe a much higher antiquity to our species, than even the boldest\r\nspeculations of the ethnologist require, for no small part of the great\r\nphysical revolution depicted on the map of Europe (Pl. 3), before\r\ndescribed, took place very gradually after the recent testacea abounded\r\nalmost to the exclusion of the extinct. Thus, for example, in the\r\ndeposits called the \"northern drift,\" or the glacial formation of Europe\r\nand North America, the fossil marine shells can easily be identified\r\nwith species either now inhabiting the neighboring sea, or living in the\r\nseas of higher latitudes. Yet they exhibit no memorials of the human\r\nrace, or of articles fabricated by the hand of man. Some of the newest\r\nof these strata passing by the name of \"raised beaches,\" occur at\r\nmoderate elevations on the coast of England, Scotland, and Ireland.\r\nOther examples are met with on a more extended scale in Scandinavia, as\r\nat the height of 200 feet at Uddevalla in Sweden, and at twice that\r\nelevation, near Christiana, in Norway, also at an altitude of 600 or 700\r\nfeet in places farther north. They consist of beds of sand and clay,\r\nfilling hollows in a district of granite and gneiss, and they must\r\nclosely resemble the accumulations of shelly matter now in progress at\r\nthe bottom of the Norwegian fiords. The rate at which the land is now\r\nrising in Scandinavia, is far too irregular in different places to\r\nafford a safe standard for estimating the minimum of time required for\r\nthe upheaval of the fundamental granite, and its marine shelly\r\ncovering, to the height of so many hundred feet; but according to the\r\ngreatest average, of five or six feet in a century, the period required\r\nwould be very considerable, and nearly the whole of it, as well as the\r\nantecedent epoch of submergence, seems to have preceded the introduction\r\nof man into these parts of the earth.\r\n\r\nThere are other post-tertiary formations of fluviatile origin, in the\r\ncentre of Europe, in which the absence of human remains is perhaps still\r\nmore striking, because, when formed, they must have been surrounded by\r\ndry land. I allude to the silt or _loess_ of the basin of the Rhine,\r\nwhich must have gradually filled up the great valley of that river since\r\nthe time when its waters, and the contiguous lands, were inhabited by\r\nthe existing species of freshwater and terrestrial mollusks. Showers of\r\nashes, thrown out by some of the last eruptions of the Eifel volcanoes,\r\nfell during the deposition of this fluviatile silt, and were\r\ninterstratified with it. But these volcanoes became exhausted, the\r\nvalley was re-excavated through the silt, and again reduced to its\r\npresent form before the period of human history. The study, therefore,\r\nof this shelly silt reveals to us the history of a long series of\r\nevents, which occurred after the testacea now living inhabited the land\r\nand rivers of Europe, and the whole terminated without any signs of the\r\ncoming of man into that part of the globe.\r\n\r\nTo cite a still more remarkable example, we observe in Sicily a lofty\r\ntable-land and hills, sometimes rising to the height of 3000 feet,\r\ncapped with a limestone, in which from 70 to 85 per cent. of the fossil\r\ntestacea are specifically identical with those now inhabiting the\r\nMediterranean. These calcareous and other argillaceous strata of the\r\nsame age are intersected by deep valleys which have been gradually\r\nformed by denudation, but have not varied materially in width or depth\r\nsince Sicily was first colonized by the Greeks. The limestone, moreover,\r\nwhich is of so late a date in geological chronology, was quarried for\r\nbuilding those ancient temples of Girgenti and Syracuse, of which the\r\nruins carry us back to a remote era in human history. If we are lost in\r\nconjectures when speculating on the ages required to lift up these\r\nformations to the height of several thousand feet above the sea, how\r\nmuch more remote must be the era when the same rocks were gradually\r\nformed beneath the waters!\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it appears that, in going back from the recent to the\r\nEocene period, we are carried by many successive steps from the fauna\r\nnow contemporary with man to an assemblage of fossil species wholly\r\ndifferent from those now living. In this retrospect we have not yet\r\nsucceeded in tracing back a perfect transition from the recent to an\r\nextinct fauna; but there are usually so many species in common to the\r\ngroups which stand next in succession as to show that there is no great\r\nchasm, no signs of a crisis when one class of organic beings was\r\nannihilated to give place suddenly to another. This analogy, therefore,\r\nderived from a period of the earth's history which can best be compared\r\nwith the present state of things, and more thoroughly investigated than\r\nany other, leads to the conclusion that the extinction and creation of\r\nspecies, has been and is the result of a slow and gradual change in the\r\norganic world.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNIFORMITY OF CHANGE CONSIDERED, SECONDLY, IN REFERENCE TO SUBTERRANEAN\r\nMOVEMENTS.\r\n\r\nTo pass on to another of the three topics before proposed for\r\ndiscussion, the reader will find, in the account given in the second\r\nbook of the earthquakes recorded in history, that certain countries\r\nhave, from time immemorial, been rudely shaken again and again, while\r\nothers, comprising by far the largest part of the globe, have remained\r\nto all appearance motionless. In the regions of convulsion rocks have\r\nbeen rent asunder, the surface has been forced up into ridges, chasms\r\nhave opened, or the ground throughout large spaces has been permanently\r\nlifted up above or let down below its former level. In the regions of\r\ntranquillity some areas have remained at rest, but others have been\r\nascertained by a comparison of measurements, made at different periods,\r\nto have risen by an insensible motion, as in Sweden, or to have subsided\r\nvery slowly, as in Greenland. That these same movements, whether\r\nascending or descending, have continued for ages in the same direction\r\nhas been established by geological evidence. Thus, we find both on the\r\neast and west coast of Sweden, that ground which formerly constituted\r\nthe bottom of the Baltic and of the ocean has been lifted up to an\r\nelevation of several hundred feet above high-water mark. The rise within\r\nthe historical period has not amounted to many yards, but the greater\r\nextent of antecedent upheaval is proved by the occurrence in inland\r\nspots, several hundred feet high, of deposits filled with fossil shells\r\nof species now living either in the ocean or the Baltic.\r\n\r\nTo detect proofs of slow and gradual subsidence must in general be more\r\ndifficult; but the theory which accounts for the form of circular coral\r\nreefs and lagoon islands, and which will be explained in the last\r\nchapter of the third book, will satisfy the reader that there are spaces\r\non the globe, several thousand miles in circumference, throughout which\r\nthe downward movement has predominated for ages, and yet the land has\r\nnever, in a single instance, gone down suddenly for several hundred feet\r\nat once. Yet geology demonstrates that the persistency of subterranean\r\nmovements in one direction has not been perpetual throughout all past\r\ntime. There have been great oscillations of level by which a surface of\r\ndry land has been submerged to a depth of several thousand feet, and\r\nthen at a period long subsequent raised again and made to emerge. Nor\r\nhave the regions now motionless been always at rest; and some of those\r\nwhich are at present the theatres of reiterated earthquakes have\r\nformerly enjoyed a long continuance of tranquillity. But although\r\ndisturbances have ceased after having long prevailed, or have\r\nrecommenced after a suspension for ages, there has been no universal\r\ndisruption of the earth's crust or desolation of the surface since\r\ntimes the most remote. The non-occurrence of such a general convulsion\r\nis proved by the perfect horizontally now retained by some of the most\r\nancient fossiliferous strata throughout wide areas.\r\n\r\n_Inferences derived from unconformable strata._--That the subterranean\r\nforces have visited different parts of the globe at successive periods,\r\nis inferred chiefly from the unconformability of strata belonging to\r\ngroups of different ages. Thus, for example, on the borders of Wales and\r\nShropshire we find the slaty beds of the ancient Silurian system curved\r\nand vertical, while the beds of the overlying carboniferous shale and\r\nsandstone are horizontal. All are agreed, that in such a case the older\r\nset of strata had suffered great dislocation before the deposition of\r\nthe newer or carboniferous beds, and that these last have never since\r\nbeen convulsed by any movements of excessive violence. But the strata of\r\nthe inferior group suffered only a local derangement, and rocks of the\r\nsame age are by no means found everywhere in a curved or vertical\r\nposition. In various parts of Europe, and particularly near Lake Wener\r\nin the south of Sweden, and in many parts of Russia, beds of the same\r\nSilurian system maintain the most perfect horizontality; and a similar\r\nobservation may be made respecting limestones and shales of the like\r\nantiquity in the great lake district of Canada and the United States.\r\nThey are still as flat and horizontal as when first formed; yet since\r\ntheir origin not only have most of the actual mountain-chains been\r\nuplifted, but the very rocks of which those mountains are composed\r\nhave been formed.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to multiply instances of similar unconformability in\r\nformations of other ages; but a few more will suffice. The coal measures\r\nbefore alluded to as horizontal on the borders of Wales are vertical in\r\nthe Mendip Hills in Somersetshire, where the overlying beds of the New\r\nRed Sandstone are horizontal. Again, in the Wolds of Yorkshire the last\r\nmentioned sandstone supports on its curved and inclined beds the\r\nhorizontal Chalk. The Chalk again is vertical on the flanks of the\r\nPyrenees, and the tertiary strata repose unconformably upon it.\r\n\r\n_Consistency of local disturbances with general uniformity._--As almost\r\nevery country supplies illustrations of the same phenomena, they who\r\nadvocate the doctrine of alternate periods of disorder and repose may\r\nappeal to the facts above described, as proving that every district has\r\nbeen by turns convulsed by earthquakes and then respited for ages from\r\nconvulsions. But so it might with equal truth be affirmed that every\r\npart of Europe has been visited alternately by winter and summer,\r\nalthough it has always been winter and always summer in some part of the\r\nplanet, and neither of these seasons has ever reigned simultaneously\r\nover the entire globe. They have been always shifting about from place\r\nto place; but the vicissitudes which recur thus annually in a single\r\nspot are never allowed to interfere with the invariable uniformity of\r\nseasons throughout the whole planet.\r\n\r\nSo, in regard to subterranean movements, the theory of the perpetual\r\nuniformity of the force which they exert on the earth's crust is quite\r\nconsistent with the admission of their alternate development and\r\nsuspension for indefinite periods within limited geographical areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNIFORMITY OF CHANGE CONSIDERED, THIRDLY, IN REFERENCE TO SEDIMENTARY\r\nDEPOSITION.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to speak of the laws governing the deposition of new\r\nstrata. If we survey the surface of the globe we immediately perceive\r\nthat it is divisible into areas of deposition and non-deposition, or, in\r\nother words, at any given time there are spaces which are the\r\nrecipients, others which are not the recipients of sedimentary matter.\r\nNo new strata, for example, are thrown down on dry land, which remains\r\nthe same from year to year; whereas, in many parts of the bottom of seas\r\nand lakes, mud, sand, and pebbles are annually spread out by rivers and\r\ncurrents. There are also great masses of limestone growing in some seas,\r\nor in mid-ocean, chiefly composed of corals and shells.\r\n\r\n_No sediment deposited on dry land._--As to the dry land, so far from\r\nbeing the receptacle of fresh accessions of matter, it is exposed almost\r\neverywhere to waste away. Forests may be as dense and lofty as those of\r\nBrazil, and may swarm with quadrupeds, birds, and insects, yet at the\r\nend of ten thousand years one layer of black mould, a few inches thick,\r\nmay be the sole representative of those myriads of trees, leaves,\r\nflowers, and fruits, those innumerable bones and skeletons of birds,\r\nquadrupeds, and reptiles, which tenanted the fertile region. Should this\r\nland be at length submerged, the waves of the sea may wash away in a few\r\nhours the scanty covering of mould, and it may merely impart a darker\r\nshade of color to the next stratum of marl, sand, or other matter newly\r\nthrown down. So also at the bottom of the ocean where no sediment is\r\naccumulating, sea-weed, zoophytes, fish, and even shells, may multiply\r\nfor ages and decompose, leaving no vestige of their form or substance\r\nbehind. Their decay, in water, although more slow, is as certain and\r\neventually as complete as in the open air. Nor can they be perpetuated\r\nfor indefinite periods in a fossil state, unless imbedded in some matrix\r\nwhich is impervious to water, or which at least does not allow a free\r\npercolation of that fluid, impregnated as it usually is, with a slight\r\nquantity of carbonic or other acid. Such a free percolation may be\r\nprevented either by the mineral nature of the matrix itself, or by the\r\nsuperposition of an impermeable stratum: but if unimpeded, the fossil\r\nshell or bone will be dissolved and removed, particle after particle,\r\nand thus entirely effaced, unless petrifaction or the substitution of\r\nmineral for organic matter happen to take place.\r\n\r\nThat there has been land as well as sea at all former geological\r\nperiods, we know from the fact, that fossil trees and terrestrial plants\r\nare imbedded in rocks of every age. Occasionally lacustrine and\r\nfluviatile shells, insects, or the bones of amphibious or land reptiles,\r\npoint to the same conclusion. The existence of dry land at all periods\r\nof the past implies, as before mentioned, the partial deposition of\r\nsediment, or its limitation to certain areas; and the next point to\r\nwhich I shall call the reader's attention, is the shifting of these\r\nareas from one region to another.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, variations in the site of sedimentary deposition are\r\nbrought about independently of subterranean movements. There is always a\r\nslight change from year to year, or from century to century. The\r\nsediment of the Rhone, for example, thrown into the Lake of Geneva, is\r\nnow conveyed to a spot a mile and a half distant from that where it\r\naccumulated in the tenth century, and six miles from the point where the\r\ndelta began originally to form. We may look forward to the period when\r\nthis lake will be filled up, and then the distribution of the\r\ntransported matter will be suddenly altered, for the mud and sand\r\nbrought down from the Alps will thenceforth, instead of being deposited\r\nnear Geneva, be carried nearly 200 miles southwards, where the Rhone\r\nenters the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nIn the deltas of large rivers, such as those of the Ganges and Indus,\r\nthe mud is first carried down for many centuries through one arm, and on\r\nthis being stopped up it is discharged by another, and may then enter\r\nthe sea at a point 50 or 100 miles distant from its first receptacle.\r\nThe direction of marine currents is also liable to be changed by various\r\naccidents, as by the heaping up of new sand-banks, or the wearing away\r\nof cliffs and promontories.\r\n\r\nBut, secondly, all these causes of fluctuation in the sedimentary areas\r\nare entirely subordinate to those great upward or downward movements of\r\nland which have been already described as prevailing over large tracts\r\nof the globe. By such elevation or subsidence certain spaces are\r\ngradually submerged, or made gradually to emerge:--in the one case\r\nsedimentary deposition may be suddenly renewed after having been\r\nsuspended for ages, in the other as suddenly made to cease after having\r\ncontinued for an indefinite period.\r\n\r\n_Causes of variation in mineral character of successive sedimentary\r\ngroups._--If deposition be renewed after a long interval, the new strata\r\nwill usually differ greatly from the sedimentary rocks previously formed\r\nin the same place, and especially if the older rocks have suffered\r\nderangement, which implies a change in the physical geography of the\r\ndistrict since the previous conveyance of sediment to the same spot. It\r\nmay happen, however, that, even when the inferior group is horizontal\r\nand conformable to the upper strata, these last may still differ\r\nentirely in mineral character, because since the origin of the older\r\nformation the geography of some distant country has been altered. In\r\nthat country rocks before concealed may have become exposed by\r\ndenudation; volcanoes may have burst out and covered the surface with\r\nscoriae and lava, or new lakes may have been formed by subsidence; and\r\nother fluctuations may have occurred, by which the materials brought\r\ndown from thence by rivers to the sea have acquired a distinct mineral\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the stream of the Mississippi is charged with\r\nsediment of a different color from that of the Arkansas and Red Rivers,\r\nwhich are tinged with red mud, derived from rocks of porphyry in \"the\r\nfar west.\" The waters of the Uruguay, says Darwin, draining a granitic\r\ncountry, are clear and black, those of the Parana, red.[258] The mud\r\nwith which the Indus is loaded, says Burnes, is of a clayey hue, that of\r\nthe Chenab, on the other hand, is reddish, that of the Sutlej is more\r\npale.[259] The same causes which make these several rivers, sometimes\r\nsituated at no great distance the one from the other, to differ greatly\r\nin the character of their sediment, will make the waters draining the\r\nsame country at different epochs, especially before and after great\r\nrevolutions in physical geography, to be entirely dissimilar. It is\r\nscarcely necessary to add, that marine currents will be affected in an\r\nanalogous manner in consequence of the formation of new shoals, the\r\nemergence of new islands, the subsidence of others, the gradual waste of\r\nneighboring coasts, the growth of new deltas, the increase of coral\r\nreefs, and other changes.\r\n\r\n_Why successive sedimentary groups contain distinct fossils._--If, in\r\nthe next place, we assume, for reasons before stated, a continual\r\nextinction of species and introduction of others into the globe, it will\r\nthen follow that the fossils of strata formed at two distant periods on\r\nthe same spot, will differ even more certainly than the mineral\r\ncomposition of the same. For rocks of the same kind have sometimes been\r\nreproduced in the same district after a long interval of time, whereas\r\nthere are no facts leading to the opinion that species which have once\r\ndied out have ever been reproduced. The submergence then of land must be\r\noften attended by the commencement of a new class of sedimentary\r\ndeposits, characterized by a new set of fossil animals and plants, while\r\nthe reconversion of the bed of the sea into land may arrest at once and\r\nfor an indefinite time the formation of geological monuments. Should the\r\nland again sink, strata will again be formed; but one or many entire\r\nrevolutions in animal or vegetable life may have been completed in the\r\ninterval.\r\n\r\n_Conditions requisite for the original completeness of a fossiliferous\r\nseries._--If we infer, for reasons before explained, that fluctuations\r\nin the animate world are brought about by the slow and successive\r\nremoval and creation of species, we shall be convinced that a rare\r\ncombination of circumstances alone can give rise to such a series of\r\nstrata as will bear testimony to a gradual passage from one state of\r\norganic life to another. To produce such strata nothing less will be\r\nrequisite than the fortunate coincidence of the following conditions:\r\nfirst, a never-failing supply of sediment in the same region throughout\r\na period of vast duration; secondly, the fitness of the deposit in every\r\npart for the permanent preservation of imbedded fossils; and, thirdly, a\r\ngradual subsidence to prevent the sea or lake from being filled up and\r\nconverted into land.\r\n\r\nIt will appear in the chapter on coral reefs,[260] that, in certain\r\nparts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, most of these conditions, if not\r\nall, are complied with, and the constant growth of coral, keeping pace\r\nwith the sinking of the bottom of the sea, seems to have gone on so\r\nslowly, for such indefinite periods, that the signs of a gradual change\r\nin organic life might probably be detected in that quarter of the globe,\r\nif we could explore its submarine geology. Instead of the growth of\r\ncoralline limestone, let us suppose, in some other place, the continuous\r\ndeposition of fluviatile mud and sand, such as the Ganges and\r\nBrahmapootra have poured for thousands of years into the Bay of Bengal.\r\nPart of this bay, although of considerable depth, might at length be\r\nfilled up before an appreciable amount of change was effected in the\r\nfish, mollusca, and other inhabitants of the sea and neighboring land.\r\nBut, if the bottom be lowered by sinking at the same rate that it is\r\nraised by fluviatile mud, the bay can never be turned into dry land. In\r\nthat case one new layer of matter may be superimposed upon another for a\r\nthickness of many thousand feet, and the fossils of the inferior beds\r\nmay differ greatly from those entombed in the uppermost, yet every\r\nintermediate gradation may be indicated in the passage from an older to\r\na newer assemblage of species. Granting, however, that such an unbroken\r\nsequence of monuments may thus be elaborated in certain parts of the\r\nsea, and that the strata happen to be all of them well adapted to\r\npreserve the included fossils from decomposition, how many accidents\r\nmust still concur before these submarine formations will be laid open to\r\nour investigation! The whole deposit must first be raised several\r\nthousand feet, in order to bring into view the very foundation; and\r\nduring the process of exposure the superior beds must not be entirely\r\nswept away by denudation.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the chances are as three to one against the mere\r\nemergence of the mass above the waters, because three-fourths of the\r\nglobe are covered by the ocean. But if it be upheaved and made to\r\nconstitute part of the dry land, it must also, before it can be\r\navailable for our instruction, become part of that area already surveyed\r\nby geologists; and this area comprehends perhaps less than a tenth of\r\nthe whole earth. In this small fraction of land already explored, and\r\nstill very imperfectly known, we are required to find a set of strata,\r\noriginally of limited extent, and probably much lessened by subsequent\r\ndenudation.\r\n\r\nYet it is precisely because we do not encounter at every step the\r\nevidence of such gradations from one state of the organic world to\r\nanother, that so many geologists embrace the doctrine of great and\r\nsudden revolutions in the history of the animate world. Not content with\r\nsimply availing themselves, for the convenience of classification, of\r\nthose gaps and chasms which here and there interrupt the continuity of\r\nthe chronological series, as at present known, they deduce, from the\r\nfrequency of these breaks in the chain of records, an irregular mode of\r\nsuccession in the events themselves both in the organic and inorganic\r\nworld. But, besides that some links of the chain which once existed are\r\nnow clearly lost and others concealed from view, we have good reason to\r\nsuspect that it was never complete originally. It may undoubtedly be\r\nsaid, that strata have been always forming somewhere, and therefore at\r\nevery moment of past time nature has added a page to her archives; but,\r\nin reference to this subject, it should be remembered that we can never\r\nhope to compile a consecutive history by gathering together monuments\r\nwhich were originally detached and scattered over the globe. For as the\r\nspecies of organic beings contemporaneously inhabiting remote regions\r\nare distinct, the fossils of the first of several periods which may be\r\npreserved in any one country, as in America, for example, will have no\r\nconnection with those of a second period found in India, and will\r\ntherefore no more enable us to trace the signs of a gradual change in\r\nthe living creation, than a fragment of Chinese history will fill up a\r\nblank in the political annals of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe absence of any deposits of importance containing recent shells in\r\nChili, or anywhere on the western coast of South America, naturally led\r\nMr. Darwin to the conclusion that \"where the bed of the sea is either\r\nstationary or rising, circumstances are far less favorable than where\r\nthe level is sinking to the accumulation of conchiferous strata of\r\nsufficient thickness and extension to resist the average vast amount of\r\ndenudation.\"[261] An examination of the superficial clay, sand, and\r\ngravel of the most modern date in Norway and Sweden, where the land is\r\nalso rising, would incline us to admit a similar proposition. Yet in\r\nthese cases there has been a supply of sediment from the waste of the\r\ncoast and the interior, especially in Patagonia and Chili. Nevertheless\r\nwherever the bottom of the sea has been continually elevated, the total\r\nthickness of sedimentary matter accumulating at depths suited to the\r\nhabitation of most of the species of shells can never be great, nor can\r\nthe deposits be thickly covered by superincumbent matter, so as to be\r\nconsolidated by pressure. When they are upheaved, therefore, the waves\r\non the beach will bear down and disperse the loose materials; whereas if\r\nthe bed of the sea subsides slowly, a mass of strata containing\r\nabundance of such species as live at moderate depths may increase in\r\nthickness to any amount, and may extend over a broad area, as the water\r\ngradually encroaches on the land. If, then, at particular periods, as in\r\nthe Miocene epoch, for example, both in Europe and North America,\r\ncontemporaneous shelly deposits have originated, and have been preserved\r\nat very distant points, it may arise from the prevalence at that period\r\nof simultaneous subsidence throughout very wide areas. The absence in\r\nthe same quarters of the globe of strata marking the ages which\r\nimmediately succeeded, may be accounted for by supposing that the level\r\nof the bed of the sea and the adjoining land was stationary or was\r\nundergoing slow upheaval.\r\n\r\nHow far some of the great violations of continuity which now exist in\r\nthe chronological table of fossiliferous rocks, will hereafter be\r\nremoved or lessened, must at present be mere matter of conjecture. The\r\nhiatus which exists in Great Britain between the fossils of the Lias and\r\nthose of the Magnesian Limestone, is supplied in Germany by the rich\r\nfauna and flora of the Muschelkalk, Keuper, and Bunter Sandstein, which\r\nwe know to be of a date precisely intermediate; those three formations\r\nbeing interposed in Germany between others which agree perfectly in\r\ntheir organic remains with our Lias and Magnesian Limestone. Until\r\nlately the fossils of the Coal-measures were separated from those of the\r\nantecedent Silurian group by a very abrupt and decided line of\r\ndemarcation; but recent discoveries have brought to light in Devonshire,\r\nBelgium, the Eifel, and Westphalia, the remains of a fauna of an\r\nintervening period. This connecting link is furnished by the fossil\r\nshells, fish, and corals of the Devonian or Old Red Sandstone group, and\r\nsome species of this newly intercalated fauna are found to be common to\r\nit and the subjacent Silurian rocks, while other species belong to it in\r\ncommon with the Coal-measures. We have also in like manner had some\r\nsuccess of late years in diminishing the hiatus which still separates\r\nthe Cretaceous and Eocene periods in Europe. Still we must expect, for\r\nreasons before stated, that some such chasms will forever continue to\r\noccur in some parts of our sedimentary series.\r\n\r\n_Consistency of the theory of gradual change with the existence of great\r\nbreaks in the series._--To return to the general argument pursued in\r\nthis chapter, it is assumed, for reasons above explained, that a slow\r\nchange of species is in simultaneous operation everywhere throughout the\r\nhabitable surface of sea and land; whereas the fossilization of plants\r\nand animals is confined to those areas where new strata are produced.\r\nThese areas, as we have seen, are always shifting their position; so\r\nthat the fossilizing process, by means of which the commemoration of the\r\nparticular state of the organic world, at any given time, is affected,\r\nmay be said to move about, visiting and revisiting different tracts in\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nTo make still more clear the supposed working of this machinery, I shall\r\ncompare it to a somewhat analogous case that might be imagined to occur\r\nin the history of human affairs. Let the mortality of the population of\r\na large country represent the successive extinction of species, and the\r\nbirths of new individuals the introduction of new species. While these\r\nfluctuations are gradually taking place everywhere, suppose\r\ncommissioners to be appointed to visit each province of the country in\r\nsuccession, taking an exact account of the number, names, and individual\r\npeculiarities of all the inhabitants, and leaving in each district a\r\nregister containing a record of this information. If, after the\r\ncompletion of one census, another is immediately made on the same plan,\r\nand then another, there will, at last, be a series of statistical\r\ndocuments in each province. When those belonging to any one province\r\nare arranged in chronological order, the contents of such as stand next\r\nto each other will differ according to the length of the intervals of\r\ntime between the taking of each census. If, for example, there are sixty\r\nprovinces, and all the registers are made in a single year, and renewed\r\nannually, the number of births and deaths will be so small, in\r\nproportion to the whole of the inhabitants, during the interval between\r\nthe compiling of the two consecutive documents, that the individuals\r\ndescribed in such documents will be nearly identical; whereas, if the\r\nsurvey of each of the sixty provinces occupies all the commissioners for\r\na whole year, so that they are unable to revisit the same place until\r\nthe expiration of sixty years, there will then be an almost entire\r\ndiscordance between the persons enumerated in two consecutive registers\r\nin the same province. There are, undoubtedly, other causes besides the\r\nmere quantity of time, which may augment or diminish the amount of\r\ndiscrepancy. Thus, at some periods a pestilential disease may have\r\nlessened the average duration of human life, or a variety of\r\ncircumstances may have caused the births to be unusually numerous, and\r\nthe population to multiply; or, a province may be suddenly colonized by\r\npersons migrating from surrounding districts.\r\n\r\nThese exceptions may be compared to the accelerated rate of fluctuation\r\nin the fauna and flora of a particular region, in which the climate and\r\nphysical geography may be undergoing an extraordinary degree of\r\nalteration.\r\n\r\nBut I must remind the reader, that the case above proposed has no\r\npretensions to be regarded as an exact parallel to the geological\r\nphenomena which I desire to illustrate; for the commissioners are\r\nsupposed to visit the different provinces in rotation; whereas the\r\ncommemorating processes by which organic remains become fossilized,\r\nalthough they are always shifting from one area to the other, are yet\r\nvery irregular in their movements. They may abandon and revisit many\r\nspaces again and again before they once approach another district; and,\r\nbesides this source of irregularity, it may often happen that, while the\r\ndepositing process is suspended, denudation may take place, which may be\r\ncompared to the occasional destruction by fire or other causes of some\r\nof the statistical documents before mentioned. It is evident that, where\r\nsuch accidents occur, the want of continuity in the series may become\r\nindefinitely great, and that the monuments which follow next in\r\nsuccession will by no means be equidistant from each other in point of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIf this train of reasoning be admitted, the occasional distinctness of\r\nthe fossil remains, in formations immediately in contact, would be a\r\nnecessary consequence of the existing laws of sedimentary deposition and\r\nsubterranean movement, accompanied by a constant mortality and\r\nrenovation of species.\r\n\r\nAs all the conclusions above insisted on are directly opposed to\r\nopinions still popular, I shall add another comparison, in the hope of\r\npreventing any possible misapprehension of the argument. Suppose we had\r\ndiscovered two buried cities at the foot of Vesuvius, immediately\r\nsuperimposed upon each other, with a great mass of tuff and lava\r\nintervening, just as Portici and Resina, if now covered with ashes,\r\nwould overlie Herculaneum. An antiquary might possibly be entitled to\r\ninfer, from the inscriptions on public edifices, that the inhabitants of\r\nthe inferior and older city were Greeks, and those of the modern towns\r\nItalians. But he would reason very hastily if he also concluded from\r\nthese data that there had been a sudden change from the Greek to the\r\nItalian language in Campania. But if he afterwards found _three_ buried\r\ncities, one above the other, the intermediate one being Roman, while, as\r\nin the former example, the lowest was Greek and the uppermost Italian,\r\nhe would then perceive the fallacy of his former opinion, and would\r\nbegin to suspect that the catastrophes by which the cities were inhumed\r\nmight have no relation whatever to the fluctuations in the language of\r\nthe inhabitants; and that, as the Roman tongue had evidently intervened\r\nbetween the Greek and Italian, so many other dialects may have been\r\nspoken in succession, and the passage from the Greek to the Italian may\r\nhave been very gradual; some terms growing obsolete, while others were\r\nintroduced from time to time.\r\n\r\nIf this antiquary could have shown that the volcanic paroxysms of\r\nVesuvius were so governed as that cities should be buried one above the\r\nother, just as often as any variation occurred in the language of the\r\ninhabitants, then, indeed, the abrupt passage from a Greek to a Roman,\r\nand from a Roman to an Italian city, would afford proof of fluctuations\r\nno less sudden in the language of the people.\r\n\r\nSo, in Geology, if we could assume that it is part of the plan of Nature\r\nto preserve, in every region of the globe, an unbroken series of\r\nmonuments to commemorate the vicissitudes of the organic creation, we\r\nmight infer the sudden extirpation of species, and the simultaneous\r\nintroduction of others, as often as two formations in contact are found\r\nto include dissimilar organic fossils. But we must shut our eyes to the\r\nwhole economy of the existing causes, aqueous, igneous, and organic, if\r\nwe fail to perceive _that such in not the plan of Nature_.\r\n\r\n_Concluding remarks on the identity of the ancient and present system of\r\nterrestrial changes._--I shall now conclude the discussion of a question\r\nwith which we have been occupied since the beginning of the fifth\r\nchapter; namely, whether there has been any interruption, from the\r\nremotest periods, of one uniform system of change in the animate and\r\ninanimate world. We were induced to enter into that inquiry by\r\nreflecting how much the progress of opinion in Geology had been\r\ninfluenced by the assumption that the analogy was slight in kind, and\r\nstill more slight in degree, between the causes which produced the\r\nformer revolutions of the globe, and those now in every-day operation.\r\nIt appeared clear that the earlier geologists had not only a scanty\r\nacquaintance with existing changes, but were singularly unconscious of\r\nthe amount of their ignorance. With the presumption naturally inspired\r\nby this unconsciousness, they had no hesitation in deciding at once that\r\ntime could never enable the existing powers of nature to work out\r\nchanges of great magnitude, still less such important revolutions as\r\nthose which are brought to light by Geology. They, therefore, felt\r\nthemselves at liberty to indulge their imaginations in guessing at what\r\n_might be_, rather than inquiring _what is_; in other words, they\r\nemployed themselves in conjecturing what might have been the course of\r\nnature at a remote period, rather than in the investigation of what was\r\nthe course of nature in their own times.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to them more philosophical to speculate on the possibilities\r\nof the past, than patiently to explore the realities of the present; and\r\nhaving invented theories under the influence of such maxims, they were\r\nconsistently unwilling to test their validity by the criterion of their\r\naccordance with the ordinary operations of nature. On the contrary, the\r\nclaims of each new hypothesis to credibility appeared enhanced by the\r\ngreat contrast, in kind or intensity, of the causes referred to, and\r\nthose now in operation.\r\n\r\nNever was there a dogma more calculated to foster indolence, and to\r\nblunt the keen edge of curiosity, than this assumption of the\r\ndiscordance between the ancient and existing causes of change. It\r\nproduced a state of mind unfavorable in the highest degree to the candid\r\nreception of the evidence of those minute but incessant alterations\r\nwhich every part of the earth's surface is undergoing, and by which the\r\ncondition of its living inhabitants is continually made to vary. The\r\nstudent, instead of being encouraged with the hope of interpreting the\r\nenigmas presented to him in the earth's structure,--instead of being\r\nprompted to undertake laborious inquiries into the natural history of\r\nthe organic world, and the complicated effects of the igneous and\r\naqueous causes now in operation, was taught to despond from the first.\r\nGeology, it was affirmed, could never rise to the rank of an exact\r\nscience,--the greater number of phenomena must forever remain\r\ninexplicable, or only be partially elucidated by ingenious conjectures.\r\nEven the mystery which invested the subject was said to constitute one\r\nof its principal charms, affording, as it did, full scope to the fancy\r\nto indulge in a boundless field of speculation.\r\n\r\nThe course directly opposed to this method of philosophizing consists in\r\nan earnest and patient inquiry, how far geological appearances are\r\nreconcilable with the effect of changes now in progress, or which may be\r\nin progress in regions inaccessible to us, and of which the reality is\r\nattested by volcanoes and subterranean movements. It also endeavors to\r\nestimate the aggregate result of ordinary operations multiplied by time,\r\nand cherishes a sanguine hope that the resources to be derived from\r\nobservation and experiment, or from the study of nature such as she now\r\nis, are very far from-being exhausted. For this reason all theories are\r\nrejected which involve the assumption of sudden and violent catastrophes\r\nand revolutions of the whole earth, and its inhabitants,--theories which\r\nare restrained by no reference to existing analogies, and in which a\r\ndesire is manifested to cut, rather than patiently to untie, the Gordian\r\nknot.\r\n\r\nWe have now, at least, the advantage of knowing, from experience, that\r\nan opposite method has always put geologists on the road that leads to\r\ntruth,--suggesting views which, although imperfect at first, have been\r\nfound capable of improvement, until at last adopted by universal\r\nconsent; while the method of speculating on a former distinct state of\r\nthings and causes, has led invariably to a multitude of contradictory\r\nsystems, which have been overthrown one after the other,--have been\r\nfound incapable of modification,--and which have often required to be\r\nprecisely reversed.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of this work will be devoted to an investigation of the\r\nchanges now going on in the crust of the earth and its inhabitants. The\r\nimportance which the student will attach to such researches will mainly\r\ndepend in the degree of confidence which he feels in the principles\r\nabove expounded. If he firmly believes in the resemblance or identity of\r\nthe ancient and present system of terrestrial changes, he will regard\r\nevery fact collected respecting the causes in diurnal action as\r\naffording him a key to the interpretation of some mystery in the past.\r\nEvents which have occurred at the most distant periods in the animate\r\nand inanimate world, will be acknowledged to throw light on each other,\r\nand the deficiency of our information respecting some of the most\r\nobscure parts of the present creation will be removed. For as, by\r\nstudying the external configuration of the existing land and its\r\ninhabitants, we may restore in imagination the appearance of the ancient\r\ncontinents which have passed away, so may we obtain from the deposits of\r\nancient seas and lakes an insight into the nature of the subaqueous\r\nprocesses now in operation, and of many forms of organic life, which,\r\nthough now existing, are veiled from sight. Rocks, also, produced by\r\nsubterranean fire in former ages, at great depths in the bowels of the\r\nearth, present us, when upraised by gradual movements, and exposed to\r\nthe light of heaven, with an image of those changes which the\r\ndeep-seated volcano may now occasion in the nether regions. Thus,\r\nalthough we are mere sojourners on the surface of the planet, chained to\r\na mere point in space, enduring but for a moment of time, the human mind\r\nis not only enabled to number worlds beyond the unassisted ken of mortal\r\neye, but to trace the events of indefinite ages before the creation of\r\nour race, and is not even withheld from penetrating into the dark\r\nsecrets of the ocean, or the interior of the solid globe; free, like the\r\nspirit which the poet described as animating the universe,\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ----ire per omnes\r\n  Terrasque, tractusque maris, coelumque profundum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN THE INORGANIC WORLD.\r\n\r\nAQUEOUS CAUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Division of the subject into changes of the organic and inorganic\r\n    world--Inorganic causes of change divided into aqueous and\r\n    igneous--Aqueous causes first considered--Fall of rain--Recent\r\n    rain-prints in mud--Destroying and transporting power of running\r\n    water--Newly formed valleys in Georgia--Sinuosities of rivers--Two\r\n    streams when united do not occupy a bed of double\r\n    surface--Inundations in Scotland--Floods caused by landslips in the\r\n    White Mountains--Bursting of a lake in Switzerland--Devastations\r\n    caused by the Anio at Tivoli--Excavations in the lavas of Etna by\r\n    Sicilian rivers--Gorge of the Simeto--Gradual recession of the\r\n    cataract of Niagara.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Division of the subject._--Geology was defined to be the science which\r\ninvestigates the former changes that have taken place in the organic as\r\nwell as in the inorganic kingdoms of nature. As vicissitudes in the\r\ninorganic world are most apparent, and as on them all fluctuations in\r\nthe animate creation must in a great measure depend, they may claim our\r\nfirst consideration. The great agents of change in the inorganic world\r\nmay be divided into two principal classes, the aqueous and the igneous.\r\nTo the aqueous belong Rain, Rivers, Torrents, Springs, Currents, and\r\nTides; to the igneous, Volcanoes, and Earthquakes. Both these classes\r\nare instruments of decay as well as of reproduction; but they may also\r\nbe regarded as antagonist forces. For the aqueous agents are incessantly\r\nlaboring to reduce the inequalities of the earth's surface to a level;\r\nwhile the igneous are equally active in restoring the unevenness of the\r\nexternal crust, partly by heaping up new matter in certain localities,\r\nand partly by depressing one portion, and forcing out another, of the\r\nearth's envelope.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, in a scientific arrangement, to give an accurate view\r\nof the combined effects of so many forces in simultaneous operation;\r\nbecause, when we consider them separately, we cannot easily estimate\r\neither the extent of their efficacy, or the kind of results which they\r\nproduce. We are in danger, therefore, when we attempt to examine the\r\ninfluence exerted singly by each, of overlooking the modifications which\r\nthey produce on one another; and these are so complicated, that\r\nsometimes the igneous and aqueous forces co-operate to produce a joint\r\neffect, to which neither of them unaided by the other could give\r\nrise,--as when repeated earthquakes unite with running water to widen a\r\nvalley; or when a thermal spring rises up from a great depth, and\r\nconveys the mineral ingredients with which it is impregnated from the\r\ninterior of the earth to the surface. Sometimes the organic combine with\r\nthe inorganic causes; as when a reef, composed of shells and corals,\r\nprotects one line of coast from the destroying power of tides or\r\ncurrents, and turns them against some other point; or when drift timber,\r\nfloated into a lake, fills a hollow to which the stream would not have\r\nhad sufficient velocity to convey earthy sediment.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, however, to divide our observations on these various\r\ncauses, and to classify them systematically, endeavoring as much as\r\npossible to keep in view that the effects in nature are mixed and not\r\nsimple, as they may appear in an artificial arrangement.\r\n\r\nIn treating, in the first place, of the aqueous causes, we may consider\r\nthem under two divisions; first, those which are connected with the\r\ncirculation of water from the land to the sea, under which are included\r\nall the phenomena of rain, rivers, glaciers, and springs; secondly,\r\nthose which arise from the movements of water in lakes, seas, and the\r\nocean, wherein are comprised the phenomena of waves, tides, and\r\ncurrents. In turning our attention to the former division, we find that\r\nthe effects of rivers may be subdivided into, first, those of a\r\ndestroying and transporting, and, secondly, those of a renovating\r\nnature; in the former are included the erosion of rocks and the\r\ntransportation of matter to lower levels; in the renovating class, the\r\nformation of deltas by the influx of sediment, and the shallowing of\r\nseas; but these processes are so intimately related to each other, that\r\nit will not always be possible to consider them under their separate\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n_Fall of Rain._--It is well known that the capacity of the atmosphere to\r\nabsorb aqueous vapor, and hold it in suspension, increases with every\r\nincrement of temperature. This capacity is also found to augment in a\r\nhigher ratio than the augmentation of the heat. Hence, as was first\r\nsuggested by the geologist, Dr. Hutton, when two volumes of air, of\r\ndifferent temperatures, both saturated with moisture, mingle together,\r\nclouds and rain are produced, for a mean degree of heat having resulted\r\nfrom the union of the two moist airs, the excess of vapor previously\r\nheld in suspension by the warmer of the two is given out, and if it be\r\nin sufficient abundance is precipitated in the form of rain.\r\n\r\nAs the temperature of the atmosphere diminishes gradually from the\r\nequator towards the pole, the evaporation of water and the quantity of\r\nrain diminish also. According to Humboldt's computation, the average\r\nannual depth of rain at the equator is 96 inches, while in lat. 45\r\ndegrees it is only 29 inches, and in lat. 60 degrees not more than 17\r\ninches. But there are so many disturbing causes, that the actual\r\ndischarge, in any given locality, may deviate very widely from this\r\nrule. In England, for example, where the average fall at London is\r\n24-1/2 inches, as ascertained at the Greenwich Observatory, there is\r\nsuch irregularity in some districts, that while at Whitehaven, in\r\nCumberland, there fell in 1849, 32 inches, the quantity of rain in\r\nBorrowdale, near Keswick (only 15 miles to the westward), was no less\r\nthan 142 inches![262] In like manner, in India, Colonel Sykes found by\r\nobservations made in 1847 and 1848, that at places situated between 17\r\ndegrees and 18 degrees north lat., on a line drawn across the Western\r\nGhauts in the Deccan, the fall of rain varied from 21 to 219\r\ninches.[263] The annual average in Bengal is probably below 80 inches,\r\nyet Dr. G. Hooker witnessed at Churrapoonjee, in the year 1850, a fall\r\nof 30 inches in 24 hours, and in the same place during a residence of\r\nsix months (from June to November) 530 inches! This occurred on the\r\nsouth face of the Khasia (or Garrow) mountains in Eastern Bengal (see\r\nmap, Chap. XVIII.), where the depth during the whole of the same year\r\nprobably exceeded 600 inches. So extraordinary a discharge of water,\r\nwhich, as we shall presently see, is very local, may be thus accounted\r\nfor. Warm, southerly winds, blowing over the Bay of Bengal, and becoming\r\nladen with vapor during their passage, reach the low level delta of the\r\nGanges and Brahmapootra, where the ordinary heat exceeds that of the\r\nsea, and where evaporation is constantly going on from countless marshes\r\nand the arms of the great rivers. A mingling of two masses of damp air\r\nof different temperatures probably causes the fall of 70 or 80 inches of\r\nrain, which takes place on the plains. The monsoon having crossed the\r\ndelta, impinges on the Khasia mountains, which rise abruptly from the\r\nplain to a mean elevation of between 4000 and 5000 feet. Here the wind\r\nnot only encounters the cold air of the mountains, but, what is far more\r\neffective as a refrigerating cause, the aerial current is made to flow\r\nupwards, and to ascend to a height of several thousand feet above the\r\nsea. Both the air and the vapor contained in it, being thus relieved of\r\nmuch atmospheric pressure, expand suddenly, and are cooled by\r\nrarefaction. The vapor is condensed, and about 500 inches of rain are\r\nthrown down annually, nearly twenty times as much as falls in Great\r\nBritain in a year, and almost all of it poured down in six months. The\r\nchannel of every torrent and river is swollen at this season, and much\r\nsandstone horizontally stratified, and other rocks are reduced to sand\r\nand gravel by the flooded streams. So great is the superficial waste (or\r\n_denudation_), that what would otherwise be a rich and luxuriantly\r\nwooded region, is converted into a wild and barren moorland.\r\n\r\nAfter the current of warm air has been thus drained of a large portion\r\nof its moisture, it still continues its northerly course to the opposite\r\nflank of the Khasia range, only 20 miles farther north, and here the\r\nfall of rain is reduced to 70 inches in the year. The same wind then\r\nblows northwards across the valley of the Brahmapootra, and at length\r\narrives so dry and exhausted at the Bhootan Himalaya (lat. 28 degrees\r\nN.), that those mountains, up to the height of 5000 feet, are naked and\r\nsterile, and all their outer valleys arid and dusty. The aerial current\r\nstill continuing its northerly course and ascending to a higher region,\r\nbecomes further cooled, condensation again ensues, and Bhootan, above\r\n5000 feet, is densely clothed with vegetation.[264]\r\n\r\nIn another part of India, immediately to the westward, similar phenomena\r\nare repeated. The same warm and humid winds, copiously charged with\r\naqueous vapor from the Bay of Bengal, hold their course due north for\r\n300 miles across the flat and hot plains of the Ganges, till they\r\nencounter the lofty Sikkim mountains. (See map, Chap. XVIII.) On the\r\nsouthern flank of these they discharge such a deluge of rain that the\r\nrivers in the rainy season rise twelve feet in as many hours. Numerous\r\nlandslips, some of them extending three or four thousand feet along the\r\nface of the mountains, composed of granite, gneiss, and slate, descend\r\ninto the beds of streams, and dam them up for a time, causing temporary\r\nlakes, which soon burst their barriers. \"Day and night,\" says Dr.\r\nHooker, \"we heard the crashing of falling trees, and the sound of\r\nboulders thrown violently against each other in the beds of torrents. By\r\nsuch wear and tear rocky fragments swept down from the hills are in part\r\nconverted into sand and fine mud; and the turbid Ganges, during its\r\nannual inundation, derives more of its sediment from this source than\r\nfrom the waste of the fine clay of the alluvial plains below.[265]\r\n\r\nOn the verge of the tropics a greater quantity of rain falls annually\r\nthan at the equator. Yet parts even of the tropical latitudes are\r\nentirely destitute of rain: Peru, for example, which owes its vegetation\r\nsolely to rivers and nightly dews. In that country easterly winds\r\nprevail, blowing from the Pacific, and these being intercepted by the\r\nAndes, and cooled as they rise, are made to part with all their moisture\r\nbefore reaching the low region to the leeward. The desert zone of North\r\nAfrica, between lat. 15 degrees and 30 degrees N., is another instance\r\nof a rainless region. Five or six consecutive years may pass in Upper\r\nEgypt, Nubia, and Dongola, or in the Desert of Sahara, without rain.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts above mentioned, the reader will infer that in the course\r\nof successive geological periods there will be great variations in the\r\nquantity of rain falling in one and the same region. At one time there\r\nmay be none whatever during the whole year; at another a fall of 100 or\r\n500 inches; and these two last averages may occur on the two opposite\r\nflanks of a mountain-chain, not more than 20 miles wide. While,\r\ntherefore, the valleys in one district are widened and deepened\r\nannually, they may remain stationary in another, the superficial soil\r\nbeing protected from waste by a dense covering of vegetation. This\r\ndiversity depends on many geographical circumstances, but principally on\r\nthe height of the land above the sea, the direction of the prevailing\r\nwinds, and the relative position, at the time being, of the plains,\r\nhills, and the ocean, conditions all of which are liable in the course\r\nof ages to undergo a complete revolution.\r\n\r\n_Recent rain-prints._--When examining, in 1842, the extensive mud-flats\r\nof Nova Scotia, which are exposed at low tide on the borders of the Bay\r\nof Fundy, I observed not only the foot-prints of birds which had\r\nrecently passed over the mud, but also very distinct impressions of\r\nrain-drops. A peculiar combination of circumstances renders these\r\nmud-flats admirably fitted to receive and retain any markings which may\r\nhappen to be made on their surface. The sediment with which the waters\r\nare charged is extremely fine, being derived from the destruction of\r\ncliffs of red sandstone and shale, and as the tides rise fifty feet and\r\nupwards, large areas are laid dry for nearly a fortnight between the\r\nspring and neap tides. In this interval the mud is baked in summer by a\r\nhot sun, so that it solidifies and becomes traversed by cracks, caused\r\nby shrinkage. Portions of the hardened mud between these cracks may then\r\nbe taken up and removed without injury. On examining the edges of each\r\nslab, we observe numerous layers, formed by successive tides, each layer\r\nbeing usually very thin, sometimes only one-tenth of an inch thick. When\r\na shower of rain falls, the highest portion of the mud-covered flat is\r\nusually too hard to receive any impressions; while that recently\r\nuncovered by the tide near the water's edge is too soft. Between these\r\nareas a zone occurs, almost as smooth and even as a looking-glass, on\r\nwhich every drop forms a cavity of circular or oval form, and, if the\r\nshower be transient, these pits retain their shape permanently, being\r\ndried by the sun, and being then too firm to be effaced by the action of\r\nthe succeeding tide, which deposits upon them a new layer of mud. Hence\r\nwe often find, in splitting open a slab an inch or more thick, on the\r\nupper surface of which the marks of recent rain occur, that an inferior\r\nlayer, deposited during some previous rise of the tide, exhibits on its\r\nunder side perfect casts of rain-prints, which stand out in relief, the\r\nmoulds of the same being seen on the layer below. But in some cases,\r\nespecially in the more sandy layers, the markings have been somewhat\r\nblunted by the tide, and by several rain-prints having been joined into\r\none by a repetition of drops falling on the same spot; in which case the\r\ncasts present a very irregular and blistered appearance.\r\n\r\nThe finest examples which I have seen of these rain-prints were sent to\r\nme by Dr. Webster, from Kentville, on the borders of the Bay of Mines,\r\nin Nova Scotia. They were made by a heavy shower which fell on the 21st\r\nof July, 1849, when the rise and fall of the tides were at their\r\nmaximum. The impressions (see fig. 13) consist of cup-shaped or\r\nhemispherical cavities, the average size of which is from one-eighth to\r\none-tenth of an inch across, but the largest are fully half an inch in\r\ndiameter, and one-tenth of an inch deep. The depth is chiefly below the\r\ngeneral surface or plane of stratification, but the walls of the cavity\r\nconsist partly of a prominent rim of sandy mud, formed of the matter\r\nwhich has been forcibly expelled from the pit. All the cavities having\r\nan oval form are deeper at one end, where they have also a higher rim,\r\nand all the deep ends have the same direction, showing towards which\r\nquarter the wind was blowing. Two or more drops are sometimes seen to\r\nhave interfered with each other; in which case it is usually possible to\r\ndetermine which drop fell last, its rim being unbroken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.\r\n\r\nRecent rain-prints, formed July 21, 1849, at Kentville, Bay of Fundy,\r\nNova Scotia. The arrow represents the direction of the shower.]\r\n\r\nOn some of the specimens the winding tubular tracks of worms are seen,\r\nwhich have been bored just beneath the surface (see fig. 13, _left\r\nside_). They occasionally pass under the middle of a rain-mark, having\r\nbeen formed subsequently. Sometimes the worms have dived beneath the\r\nsurface, and then reappeared. All these appearances, both of rain-prints\r\nand worm-tracks, are of great geological interest, as their exact\r\ncounterparts are seen in rocks of various ages, even in formations of\r\nvery high antiquity.[266] Small cavities, often corresponding in size to\r\nthose produced by rain, are also caused by air-bubbles rising up through\r\nsand or mud; but these differ in character from rain-prints, being\r\nusually deeper than they are wide, and having their sides steeper.\r\nThese, indeed, are occasionally vertical, or overarching, the opening at\r\nthe top being narrower than the pit below. In their mode, also, of\r\nmutual interference they are unlike rain-prints.[267]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the effects of mountains in cooling currents of moist\r\nair, and causing the condensation of aqueous vapor in the manner above\r\ndescribed, it follows that in every country, as a general rule, the more\r\nelevated regions become perpetual reservoirs of water, which descends\r\nand irrigates the lower valleys and plains. The largest quantity of\r\nwater is first carried to the highest region, and then made to descend\r\nby steep declivities towards the sea; so that it acquires superior\r\nvelocity, and removes more soil, than it would do if the rain had been\r\ndistributed over the plains and mountains equally in proportion to their\r\nrelative areas. The water is also made by these means to pass over the\r\ngreatest distances before it can regain the sea.\r\n\r\nIt has already been observed that in higher latitudes, where the\r\natmosphere being colder is capable of holding less water in suspension,\r\na diminished fall of rain takes place. Thus at St. Petersburg, the\r\namount is only 16 inches, and at Uleaborg in the Gulf of Bothnia (N.\r\nlat. 65 degrees), only 13-1/2 inches, or less than half the average of\r\nEngland, and even this small quantity descends more slowly in the\r\ntemperate zone, and is spread more equally over the year than in\r\ntropical climates. But in reference to geological changes, frost in the\r\ncolder latitude acts as a compensating power in the disintegration of\r\nrocks, and the transportation of stones to lower levels.\r\n\r\nWater when converted into ice augments in bulk more than one-twentieth\r\nof its volume, and owing to this property it widens the minute crevices\r\n(or _joints_) of rocks into which it penetrates. Ice also in various\r\nways, as will be shown in the next chapter, gives buoyancy to mud and\r\nsand, even to huge blocks of stone, enabling rivers of moderate size and\r\nvelocity to carry them to a great distance.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical force exerted by running water in undermining cliffs, and\r\nrounding off the angles of hard rock, is mainly due to the intermixture\r\nof foreign ingredients. Sand and pebbles, when hurried along by the\r\nviolence of the stream, are thrown against every obstacle lying in their\r\nway, and thus a power of attrition is acquired, capable of wearing\r\nthrough the hardest siliceous stones, on which water alone could make no\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\n_Newly formed valleys._--When travelling in Georgia and Alabama, in\r\n1846, I saw in both those States the commencement of hundreds of valleys\r\nin places where the native forest had recently been removed. One of\r\nthese newly formed gulleys or ravines is represented in the annexed\r\nwoodcut (fig. 14), from a drawing which I made on the spot. It occurs\r\nthree miles and a half due west of Milledgeville, the capital of\r\nGeorgia, and is situated on the farm of Pomona, on the direct road to\r\nMacon.[268]\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, before the land was cleared, it had no existence; but\r\nwhen the trees of the forest were cut down, cracks three feet deep were\r\ncaused by the sun's heat in the clay; and, during the rains, a sudden\r\nrush of water through the principal crack deepened it at its lower\r\nextremity, from whence the excavating power worked backwards, till, in\r\nthe course of twenty years, a chasm, measuring no less than 55 feet in\r\ndepth, 300 yards in length, and varying in width from 20 to 180 feet,\r\nwas the result. The high road has been several times turned to avoid\r\nthis cavity, the enlargement of which is still proceeding, and the old\r\nline of road may be seen to have held its course directly over what is\r\nnow the wildest part of the ravine. In the perpendicular walls of this\r\ngreat chasm appear beds of clay and sand, red, white, yellow, and\r\ngreen, produced by the decomposition in situ of hornblendic gneiss,\r\nwith layers and veins of quartz, which remain entire, to prove that the\r\nwhole mass was once solid and crystalline.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.\r\n\r\nRavine on the farm of Pomona, near Milledgeville, Georgia, as it\r\nappeared January, 1846.\r\n\r\nExcavated in twenty years, 55 feet deep, and 180 feet broad.]\r\n\r\nI infer, from the rapidity of the denudation which only began here after\r\nthe removal of the native wood, that this spot, elevated about 600 feet\r\nabove the sea, has been always covered with a dense forest, from the\r\nremote time when it first emerged from the sea. The termination of the\r\ncavity on the right hand in the foreground is the head or upper end of\r\nthe ravine, and in almost every case, such gulleys are lengthened by the\r\nstreams cutting their way backwards. The depth at the upper end is\r\noften, as in this case, considerable, and there is usually at this\r\npoint, during floods, a small cascade.\r\n\r\n_Sinuosities of rivers._--In proportion as such valleys are widened,\r\nsinuosities are caused by the deflection of the stream first to one\r\nside and then to the other. The unequal hardness of the materials\r\nthrough which the channel is eroded tends partly to give new directions\r\nto the lateral force of excavation. When by these, or by accidental\r\nshiftings of the alluvial matter in the channel, the current is made to\r\ncross its general line of descent, it eats out a curve in the opposite\r\nbank, or in the side of the hills bounding the valley, from which curve\r\nit is turned back again at an equal angle, so that it recrosses the line\r\nof descent, and gradually hollows out another curve lower down in the\r\nopposite bank, till the whole sides of the valley, or river bed, present\r\na succession of salient and retiring angles. Among the causes of\r\ndeviation from a straight course, by which torrents and rivers tend in\r\nmountainous regions to widen the valleys through which they flow, may be\r\nmentioned the confluence of lateral torrents, swollen irregularly at\r\ndifferent seasons by partial storms, and discharging at different times\r\nunequal quantities of sand, mud, and pebbles, into the main channel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\nWhen the tortuous flexures of a river are extremely great, as often\r\nhappens in alluvial plains, the aberration from the direct line of\r\ndescent may be restored by the river cutting through the isthmus which\r\nseparates two neighboring curves. Thus in the annexed diagram, the\r\nextreme sinuosity of the river has caused it to return for a brief space\r\nin a contrary direction to its main course, so that a peninsula is\r\nformed, and the isthmus (at _a_) is consumed on both sides by currents\r\nflowing in opposite directions. In this case an island is soon\r\nformed,--on either side of which a portion of the stream usually\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n_Transporting power of water._--In regard to the transporting power of\r\nwater, we may often be surprised at the facility with which streams of a\r\nsmall size, and descending a slight declivity, bear along coarse sand\r\nand gravel; for we usually estimate the weight of rocks in air, and do\r\nnot reflect on their comparative buoyancy when submerged in a denser\r\nfluid. The specific gravity of many rocks is not more than twice that of\r\nwater, and very rarely more than thrice, so that almost all the\r\nfragments propelled by a stream have lost a third, and many of them a\r\nhalf, of what we usually term their weight.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved by experiment, in contradiction to the theories of\r\nthe earlier writers on hydrostatics, to be a universal law, regulating\r\nthe motion of running water, that the velocity at the bottom of the\r\nstream is everywhere less than in any part above it, and is greatest at\r\nthe surface. Also that the superficial particles in the middle of the\r\nstream move swifter than those at the sides. This retardation of the\r\nlowest and lateral currents is produced by friction; and when the\r\nvelocity is sufficiently great, the soil composing the sides and bottom\r\ngives way. A velocity of three inches per second at the bottom is\r\nascertained to be sufficient to tear up fine clay,--six inches per\r\nsecond, fine sand,--twelve inches per second, fine gravel,--and three\r\nfeet per second, stones of the size of an egg.[269]\r\n\r\nWhen this mechanical power of running water is considered, we are\r\nprepared for the transportation before alluded to of large quantities of\r\ngravel, sand, and mud, by torrents which descend from mountainous\r\nregions. But a question naturally arises, How the more tranquil rivers\r\nof the valleys and plains, flowing on comparatively level ground, can\r\nremove the prodigious burden which is discharged into them by their\r\nnumerous tributaries, and by what means they are enabled to convey the\r\nwhole mass to the sea? If they had not this removing power, their\r\nchannels would be annually choked up, and the valleys of the lower\r\ncountry, and plains at the base of mountain-chains, would be continually\r\nstrewed over with fragments of rock and sterile sand. But this evil is\r\nprevented by a general law regulating the conduct of running\r\nwater,--that two equal streams do not, when united, occupy a bed of\r\ndouble surface. Nay, the width of the principal river, after the\r\njunction of a tributary, sometimes remains the same as before, or is\r\neven lessened. The cause of this apparent paradox was long ago explained\r\nby the Italian writers, who had studied the confluence of the Po and its\r\nfeeders in the plains of Lombardy.\r\n\r\nThe addition of a smaller river augments the velocity of the main\r\nstream, often in the same proportion as it does the quantity of water.\r\nThus the Venetian branch of the Po swallowed up the Ferranese branch and\r\nthat of Panaro without any enlargement of its own dimensions. The cause\r\nof the greater velocity is, first, that after the union of two rivers\r\nthe water, in place of the friction of four shores, has only that of two\r\nto surmount; 2dly, because the main body of the stream being farther\r\ndistant from the banks, flows on with less interruption; and lastly,\r\nbecause a greater quantity of water moving more swiftly, digs deeper\r\ninto the river's bed. By this beautiful adjustment, the water which\r\ndrains the interior country is made continually to occupy less room as\r\nit approaches the sea; and thus the most valuable part of our\r\ncontinents, the rich deltas and great alluvial plains, are prevented\r\nfrom being constantly under water.\r\n\r\n_River floods in Scotland_, 1829.--Many remarkable illustrations of the\r\npower of running water in moving stones and heavy materials were\r\nafforded by the storm and floods which occurred on the 3d and 4th of\r\nAugust, 1829, in Aberdeenshire and other counties in Scotland. The\r\nelements during this storm assumed all the characters which mark the\r\ntropical hurricanes; the wind blowing in sudden gusts and whirlwinds,\r\nthe lightning and thunder being such as is rarely witnessed in our\r\nclimate, and heavy rain falling without intermission. The floods\r\nextended almost simultaneously, and with equal violence over that part\r\nof the northeast of Scotland which would be cut off by two lines drawn\r\nfrom the head of Lochrannoch, one towards Inverness and the other to\r\nStonehaven. The united line of the different rivers which were flooded,\r\ncould not be less than from five to six hundred miles in length; and the\r\nwhole of their courses were marked by the destruction of bridges, roads,\r\ncrops, and buildings. Sir T. D. Lauder has recorded the destruction of\r\nthirty-eight bridges, and the entire obliteration of a great number of\r\nfarms and hamlets. On the Nairn, a fragment of sandstone, fourteen feet\r\nlong by three feet wide and one foot thick, was carried above 200 yards\r\ndown the river. Some new ravines were formed on the sides of mountains\r\nwhere no streams had previously flowed, and ancient river-channels,\r\nwhich had never been filled from time immemorial, gave passage to a\r\ncopious flood.[270]\r\n\r\nThe bridge over the Dee at Ballater consisted of five arches, having\r\nupon the whole a water-way of 260 feet. The bed of the river, on which\r\nthe piers rested, was composed of rolled pieces of granite and gneiss.\r\nThe bridge was built of granite, and had stood uninjured for twenty\r\nyears; but the different parts were swept away in succession by the\r\nflood, and the whole mass of masonry disappeared in the bed of the\r\nriver. \"The river Don,\" observes Mr. Farquharson, in his account of the\r\ninundations, \"has upon my own premises forced a mass of four or five\r\nhundred tons of stones, many of them two or three hundred pounds'\r\nweight, up an inclined plane, rising six feet in eight or ten yards, and\r\nleft them in a rectangular heap, about three feet deep on a flat\r\nground:--the heap ends abruptly at its lower extremity.\"[271]\r\n\r\nThe power even of a small rivulet, when swollen by rain, in removing\r\nheavy bodies, was exemplified in August, 1827, in the College, a small\r\nstream which flows at a slight declivity from the eastern watershed of\r\nthe Cheviot Hills. Several thousand tons' weight of gravel and sand were\r\ntransported to the plain of the Till, and a bridge, then in progress of\r\nbuilding, was carried away, some of the arch-stones of which, weighing\r\nfrom half to three quarters of a ton each, were propelled two miles down\r\nthe rivulet. On the same occasion, the current tore away from the\r\nabutment of a mill-dam a large block of greenstone-porphyry, weighing\r\nnearly two tons, and transported it to the distance of a quarter of a\r\nmile. Instances are related as occurring repeatedly, in which from one\r\nto three thousand tons of gravel are, in like manner, removed by this\r\nstreamlet to still greater distances in one day.[272]\r\n\r\n_Floods caused by landslips_, 1826.--The power which running water may\r\nexert in the lapse of ages, in widening and deepening a valley, does not\r\nso much depend on the volume and velocity of the stream usually flowing\r\nin it, as on the number and magnitude of the obstructions which have, at\r\ndifferent periods, opposed its free passage. If a torrent, however\r\nsmall, be effectually dammed up, the size of the valley above the\r\nbarrier, and its declivity below, and not the dimensions of the torrent,\r\nwill determine the violence of the dabacle. The most universal source of\r\nlocal deluges, are landslips, slides, or avalanches, as they are\r\nsometimes called, when great masses of rock and soil, or sometimes ice\r\nand snow, are precipitated into the bed of a river, the boundary cliffs\r\nof which have been thrown down by the shock of an earthquake, or\r\nundermined by springs or other causes. Volumes might be filled with the\r\nenumeration of instances on record of these terrific catastrophes; I\r\nshall therefore select a few examples of recent occurrence, the facts of\r\nwhich are well authenticated.\r\n\r\nTwo dry seasons in the White Mountains, in New Hampshire (United\r\nStates), were followed by heavy rains on the 28th August, 1826, when\r\nfrom the steep and lofty declivities which rise abruptly on both sides\r\nof the river Saco, innumerable rocks and stones, many of sufficient size\r\nto fill a common apartment, were detached, and in their descent swept\r\ndown before them, in one promiscuous and frightful ruin, forests,\r\nshrubs, and the earth which sustained them. Although there are numerous\r\nindications on the steep sides of these hills of former slides of the\r\nsame kind, yet no tradition had been handed down of any similar\r\ncatastrophe within the memory of man, and the growth of the forest on\r\nthe very spots now devastated, clearly showed that for a long interval\r\nnothing similar had occurred. One of these moving masses was afterwards\r\nfound to have slid three miles, with an average breadth of a quarter of\r\na mile. The natural excavations commenced generally in a trench a few\r\nyards in depth and a few rods in width, and descended the mountains,\r\nwidening and deepening till they became vast chasms. At the base of\r\nthese hollow ravines was seen a confused mass of ruins, consisting of\r\ntransported earth, gravel, rocks, and trees. Forests of spruce-fir and\r\nhemlock, a kind of fir somewhat resembling our yew in foliage, were\r\nprostrated with as much ease as if they had been fields of grain; for,\r\nwhere they disputed the ground, the torrent of mud and rock accumulated\r\nbehind, till it gathered sufficient force to burst the temporary\r\nbarrier.\r\n\r\nThe valleys of the Amonoosuck and Saco presented, for many miles, an\r\nuninterrupted scene of desolation; all the bridges being carried away,\r\nas well as those over their tributary streams. In some places, the road\r\nwas excavated to the depth of from fifteen to twenty feet; in others, it\r\nwas covered with earth, rocks, and trees, to as great a height. The\r\nwater flowed for many weeks after the flood, as densely charged with\r\nearth as it could be without being changed into mud, and marks were seen\r\nin various localities of its having risen on either side of the valley\r\nto more than twenty-five feet above its ordinary level. Many sheep and\r\ncattle were swept away, and the Willey family, nine in number, who in\r\nalarm had deserted their house, were destroyed on the banks of the Saco;\r\nseven of their mangled bodies were afterwards found near the river,\r\nburied beneath drift-wood and mountain ruins.[273] Eleven years after\r\nthe event, the deep channels worn by the avalanches of mud and stone,\r\nand the immense heaps of boulders and blocks of granite in the river\r\nchannel, still formed, says Professor Hubbard, a picturesque feature in\r\nthe scenery.[274]\r\n\r\nWhen I visited the country in 1845, eight years after Professor Hubbard,\r\nI found the signs of devastation still very striking; I also\r\nparticularly remarked that although the surface of the bare granitic\r\nrocks had been smoothed by the passage over them of so much mud and\r\nstone, there were no continuous parallel and rectilinear furrows, nor\r\nany of the fine scratches or striae which characterize _glacial_ action.\r\nThe absence of these is nowhere more clearly exemplified than in the\r\nbare rocks over which passed the great \"Willey slide\" of 1826.[275]\r\n\r\nBut the catastrophes in the White Mountains are insignificant, when\r\ncompared to those which are occasioned by earthquakes, when the boundary\r\nhills, for miles in length, are thrown down into the hollow of a valley.\r\nI shall have opportunities of alluding to inundations of this kind, when\r\ntreating expressly of earthquakes, and shall content myself at present\r\nwith selecting an example of a flood due to a different cause.\r\n\r\n_Flood in the valley of Bagnes_, 1818.--The valley of Bagnes is one of\r\nthe largest of the lateral embranchments of the main valley of the\r\nRhone, above the Lake of Geneva. Its upper portion was, in 1818,\r\nconverted into a lake by the damming up of a narrow pass, by avalanches\r\nof snow and ice, precipitated from an elevated glacier into the bed of\r\nthe river Dranse. In the winter season, during continued frost, scarcely\r\nany water flows in the bed of this river to preserve an open channel, so\r\nthat the ice barrier remained entire until the melting of the snows in\r\nspring, when a lake was formed above, about half a league in length,\r\nwhich finally attained in some parts a depth of about two hundred feet,\r\nand a width of about seven hundred feet. To prevent or lessen the\r\nmischief apprehended from the sudden bursting of the barrier, an\r\nartificial gallery, seven hundred feet in length, was cut through the\r\nice, before the waters had risen to a great height. When at length they\r\naccumulated and flowed through this tunnel, they dissolved the ice, and\r\nthus deepened their channel, until nearly half of the whole contents of\r\nthe lake were slowly drained off. But at length, on the approach of the\r\nhot season, the central portion of the remaining mass of ice gave way\r\nwith a tremendous crash, and the residue of the lake was emptied in half\r\nan hour. In the course of its descent, the waters encountered several\r\nnarrow gorges, and at each of these they rose to a great height, and\r\nthen burst with new violence into the next basin, sweeping along rocks,\r\nforests, houses, bridges, and cultivated land. For the greater part of\r\nits course the flood resembled a moving mass of rock and mud, rather\r\nthan of water. Some fragments of granitic rocks, of enormous magnitude,\r\nand which from their dimensions, might be compared without exaggeration\r\nto houses, were torn out of a more ancient alluvion, and borne down for\r\na quarter of a mile. One of the fragments moved was sixty paces in\r\ncircumference.[276] The velocity of the water, in the first part of its\r\ncourse, was thirty-three feet per second, which diminished to six feet\r\nbefore it reached the Lake of Geneva, where it arrived in six hours and\r\na half, the distance being forty-five miles.[277]\r\n\r\nThis flood left behind it, on the plains of Martigny, thousands of trees\r\ntorn up by the roots, together with the ruins of buildings. Some of the\r\nhouses in that town were filled with mud up to the second story. After\r\nexpanding in the plain of Martigny, it entered the Rhone, and did no\r\nfarther damage; but some bodies of men, who had been drowned above\r\nMartigny, were afterwards found, at the distance of about thirty miles,\r\nfloating on the farther side of the Lake of Geneva, near Vevay.\r\n\r\nThe waters, on escaping from the temporary lake, intermixed with mud and\r\nrock, swept along, for the first four miles, at the rate of above twenty\r\nmiles an hour; and M. Escher, the engineer, calculated that the flood\r\nfurnished 300,000 cubic feet of water every second--an efflux which is\r\nfive times greater than that of the Rhine below Basle. Now, if part of\r\nthe lake had not been gradually drained off, the flood would have been\r\nnearly double, approaching in volume to some of the largest rivers in\r\nEurope. It is evident, therefore, that when we are speculating on the\r\nexcavating force which a river may have exerted in any particular\r\nvalley, the most important question is, not the volume of the existing\r\nstream, nor the present levels of its channel, nor even the nature of\r\nthe rocks, but the probability of a succession of floods at some period\r\nsince the time when the valley may have been first elevated above the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nFor several months after the dabacle of 1818, the Dranse, having no\r\nsettled channel, shifted its position continually from one side to the\r\nother of the valley, carrying away newly-erected bridges, undermining\r\nhouses, and continuing to be charged with as large a quantity of earthy\r\nmatter as the fluid could hold in suspension. I visited this valley four\r\nmonths after the flood, and was witness to the sweeping away of a\r\nbridge, and the undermining of part of a house. The greater part of the\r\nice-barrier was then standing, presenting vertical cliffs 150 feet high,\r\nlike ravines in the lava-currents of Etna or Auvergne, where they are\r\nintersected by rivers.\r\n\r\nInundations, precisely similar, are recorded to have occurred at former\r\nperiods in this district, and from the same cause. In 1595, for example,\r\na lake burst, and the waters, descending with irresistible fury,\r\ndestroyed the town of Martigny, where from sixty to eighty persons\r\nperished. In a similar flood, fifty years before, 140 persons were\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\n_Flood at Tivoli_, 1826.--I shall conclude with one more example derived\r\nfrom a land of classic recollections, the ancient Tibur, and which,\r\nlike all the other inundations above alluded to, occurred within the\r\npresent century. The younger Pliny, it will be remembered, describes a\r\nflood on the Anio, which destroyed woods, rocks, and houses, with the\r\nmost sumptuous villas and works of arts.[278] For four or five centuries\r\nconsecutively, this \"headlong stream,\" as Horace truly called it, has\r\noften remained within its bounds, and then, after so long an interval of\r\nrest, has at different periods inundated its banks again, and widened\r\nits channel. The last of these catastrophes happened 15th Nov. 1826,\r\nafter heavy rains, such as produced the floods before alluded to in\r\nScotland. The waters appear also to have been impeded by an artificial\r\ndike, by which they were separated into two parts, a short distance\r\nabove Tivoli. They broke through this dike; and leaving the left trench\r\ndry, precipitated themselves, with their whole weight, on the right\r\nside. Here they undermined, in the course of a few hours, a high cliff,\r\nand widened the river's channel about fifteen paces. On this height\r\nstood the church of St. Lucia, and about thirty-six houses of the town\r\nof Tivoli, which were all carried away, presenting as they sank into the\r\nroaring flood, a terrific scene of destruction to the spectators on the\r\nopposite bank. As the foundations were gradually removed, each building,\r\nsome of them edifices of considerable height, was first traversed with\r\nnumerous rents, which soon widened into large fissures, until at length\r\nthe roofs fell in with a crash, and then the walls sunk into the river,\r\nand were hurled down the cataract below.[279]\r\n\r\nThe destroying agency of the flood came within two hundred yards of the\r\nprecipice on which the beautiful temple of Vesta stands; but fortunately\r\nthis precious relic of antiquity was spared, while the wreck of modern\r\nstructures was hurled down the abyss. Vesta, it will be remembered, in\r\nthe heathen mythology, personified the stability of the earth; and when\r\nthe Samian astronomer, Aristarchus, first taught that the earth revolved\r\non its axis, and round the sun, he was publicly accused of impiety, \"for\r\nremoving the everlasting Vesta from her place.\" Playfair observed, that\r\nwhen Hutton ascribed instability to the earth's surface, and represented\r\nthe continents which we inhabit as the theatre of incessant change and\r\nmovement, his antagonists, who regarded them as unalterable, assailed\r\nhim in a similar manner with accusations founded on religious\r\nprejudices.[280] We might appeal to the excavating power of the Anio as\r\ncorroborative of one of the most controverted parts of the Huttonian\r\ntheory; and if the days of omens had not gone by, the geologists who now\r\nworship Vesta might regard the late catastrophe as portentous. We may,\r\nat least, recommend the modern votaries of the goddess to lose no time\r\nin making a pilgrimage to her shrine, for the next flood may not respect\r\nthe temple.\r\n\r\n_Excavation of rocks by running water._--The rapidity with which even\r\nthe smallest streams hollow out deep channels in soft and destructible\r\nsoils is remarkably exemplified in volcanic countries, where the sand\r\nand half-consolidated tuffs opposed but a slight resistance to the\r\ntorrents which descend the mountain-side. After the heavy rains which\r\nfollowed the eruption of Vesuvius in 1824, the water flowing from the\r\nAtrio del Cavallo cut, in three days, a new chasm through strata of tuff\r\nand ejected volcanic matter, to the depth of twenty-five feet. I found\r\nthe old mule-road, in 1828, intersected by this new ravine.\r\n\r\nThe gradual erosion of deep chasms through some of the hardest rocks, by\r\nthe constant passage of running water, charged with foreign matter, is\r\nanother phenomenon of which striking examples may be adduced.\r\nIllustrations of this excavating power are presented by many valleys in\r\ncentral France where the channels of rivers have been barred up by solid\r\ncurrents of lava, through which the streams have re-excavated a passage,\r\nto the depth of from twenty to seventy feet and upwards, and often of\r\ngreat width. In these cases there are decisive proofs that neither the\r\nsea, nor any denuding wave or extraordinary body of water, has passed\r\nover the spot since the melted lava was consolidated. Every hypothesis\r\nof the intervention of sudden and violent agency is entirely excluded,\r\nbecause the cones of _loose_ scoriae, out of which the lavas flowed, are\r\noftentimes at no great elevation above the rivers, and have remained\r\nundisturbed during the whole period which has been sufficient for the\r\nhollowing out of such enormous ravines.\r\n\r\n_Recent excavation by the Simeto._--But I shall at present confine\r\nmyself to examples derived from events which have happened since the\r\ntime of history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.\r\n\r\nRecent excavation of lava at the foot of Etna by the river Simeto.]\r\n\r\nAt the western base of Etna, a current of lava (A A, fig. 16),\r\ndescending from near the summit of the great volcano, has flowed to the\r\ndistance of five or six miles, and then reached the alluvial plain of\r\nthe Simeto, the largest of the Sicilian rivers, which skirts the base of\r\nEtna, and falls into the sea a few miles south of Catania. The lava\r\nentered the river about three miles above the town of Aderno, and not\r\nonly occupied its channel for some distance, but, crossing to the\r\nopposite side of the valley, accumulated there in a rocky mass.\r\nGemmellaro gives the year 1603 as the date of the eruption.[281] The\r\nappearance of the current clearly proves, that it is one of the most\r\nmodern of those of Etna; for it has not been covered or crossed by\r\nsubsequent streams or ejections, and the olives which had been planted\r\non its surface were all of small size, when I examined the spot in 1828,\r\nyet they were older than the natural wood on the same lava. In the\r\ncourse, therefore, of about two centuries, the Simeto has eroded a\r\npassage from fifty to several hundred feet wide, and in some parts from\r\nforty to fifty feet deep.\r\n\r\nThe portion of lava cut through is in no part porous or scoriaceous, but\r\nconsists of a compact homogeneous mass of hard blue rock, somewhat\r\ninferior in weight to ordinary basalt, and containing crystals of\r\nolivine and glassy felspar. The general declivity of this part of the\r\nbed of the Simeto is not considerable; but, in consequence of the\r\nunequal waste of the lava, two water-falls occur at Passo Manzanelli,\r\neach about six feet in height. Here the chasm (B, fig. 16) is about\r\nforty feet deep, and only fifty broad.\r\n\r\nThe sand and pebbles in the river-bed consist chiefly of a brown\r\nquartzose sandstone, derived from the upper country; but the materials\r\nof the volcanic rock itself must have greatly assisted the attrition.\r\nThis river, like the Caltabiano on the eastern side of Etna, has not yet\r\ncut down to the ancient bed of which it was dispossessed, and of which\r\nthe probable position is indicated in the annexed diagram (C, fig. 16).\r\n\r\nOn entering the narrow ravine where the water foams down the two\r\ncataracts, we are entirely shut out from all view of the surrounding\r\ncountry; and a geologist who is accustomed to associate the\r\ncharacteristic features of the landscape with the relative age of\r\ncertain rocks, can scarcely dissuade himself from the belief that he is\r\ncontemplating a scene in some rocky gorge of a primary district. The\r\nexternal forms of the hard blue lava are as massive as any of the most\r\nancient trap-rocks of Scotland. The solid surface is in some parts\r\nsmoothed and almost polished by attrition, and covered in others with a\r\nwhite lichen, which imparts to it an air of extreme antiquity, so as\r\ngreatly to heighten the delusion. But the moment we reascend the cliff\r\nthe spell is broken; for we scarcely recede a few paces, before the\r\nravine and river disappear, and we stand on the black and rugged surface\r\nof a vast current of lava, which seems unbroken, and which we can trace\r\nup nearly to the distant summit of that majestic cone which Pindar\r\ncalled \"the pillar of heaven,\" and which still continues to send forth a\r\nfleecy wreath of vapor, reminding us that its fires are not extinct, and\r\nthat it may again give out a rocky stream, wherein other scenes like\r\nthat now described may present themselves to future observers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. Lake Erie. The Falls.\r\n\r\nLimestone Shale.\r\n\r\nLewiston. Niagara River. Queenstown.]\r\n\r\n_Falls of Niagara._--The falls of Niagara afford a magnificent example\r\nof the progressive excavation of a deep valley in solid rock. That river\r\nflows over a flat table-land, in a depression of which Lake Erie is\r\nsituated. Where it issues from the lake, it is nearly a mile in width,\r\nand 330 feet above Lake Ontario, which is about 30 miles distant. For\r\nthe first fifteen miles below Lake Erie the surrounding country,\r\ncomprising Upper Canada on the west, and the state of New York on the\r\neast, is almost on a level with its banks, and nowhere more than thirty\r\nor forty feet above them.[282] (See fig. 17.) The river being\r\noccasionally interspersed with low wooded islands, and having sometimes\r\na width of three miles, glides along at first with a clear, smooth, and\r\ntranquil current, falling only fifteen feet in as many miles, and in\r\nthis part of its course resembling an arm of Lake Erie. But its\r\ncharacter is afterwards entirely changed, on approaching the Rapids,\r\nwhere it begins to rush and foam over a rocky and uneven limestone\r\nbottom, for the space of nearly a mile, till at length it is thrown down\r\nperpendicularly 165 feet at the Falls. Here the river is divided into\r\ntwo sheets of water by an island, the largest cataract being more than a\r\nthird of a mile broad, the smaller one having a breadth of six hundred\r\nfeet. When the water has precipitated itself into an unfathomable pool,\r\nit rushes with great velocity down the sloping bottom of a narrow chasm,\r\nfor a distance of seven miles. This ravine varies from 200 to 400 yards\r\nin width from cliff to cliff; contrasting, therefore, strongly in its\r\nbreadth with that of the river above. Its depth is from 200 to 300 feet,\r\nand it intersects for about seven miles the table-land before described,\r\nwhich terminates suddenly at Queenstown in an escarpment or long line of\r\ninland cliff facing northwards, towards Lake Ontario. The Niagara, on\r\nreaching the escarpment and issuing from the gorge, enters the flat\r\ncountry, which is so nearly on a level with Lake Ontario, that there is\r\nonly a fall of about four feet in the seven additional miles which\r\nintervene between Queenstown and the shores of that lake.\r\n\r\nIt has long been the popular belief that the Niagara once flowed in a\r\nshallow valley across the whole platform, from the present site of the\r\nFalls to the escarpment (called the Queenstown heights), where it is\r\nsupposed that the cataract was first situated, and that the river has\r\nbeen slowly eating its way backwards through the rocks for the distance\r\nof seven miles. This hypothesis naturally suggests itself to every\r\nobserver, who sees the narrowness of the gorge at its termination, and\r\nthroughout its whole course, as far up as the Falls, above which point\r\nthe river expands as before stated. The boundary cliffs of the ravine\r\nare usually perpendicular, and in many places undermined on one side by\r\nthe impetuous stream. The uppermost rock of the table-land at the Falls\r\nconsists of hard limestone (a member of the Silurian series), about\r\nninety feet thick, beneath which lie soft shales of equal thickness,\r\ncontinually undermined by the action of the spray, which rises from the\r\npool into which so large a body of water is projected, and is driven\r\nviolently by gusts of wind against the base of the precipice. In\r\nconsequence of this action, and that of frost, the shale disintegrates\r\nand crumbles away, and portions of the incumbent rock overhang 40 feet,\r\nand often when unsupported tumble down, so that the Falls do not remain\r\nabsolutely stationary at the same spot, even for half a century.\r\nAccounts have come down to us, from the earliest period of observation,\r\nof the frequent destruction of these rocks, and the sudden descent of\r\nhuge fragments in 1818 and 1828, are said to have shaken the adjacent\r\ncountry like an earthquake. The earliest travellers, Hennepin and Kalm,\r\nwho in 1678 and 1751 visited the Falls, and published views of them,\r\nattest the fact, that the rocks have been suffering from dilapidation\r\nfor more than a century and a half, and that some slight changes, even\r\nin the scenery of the cataract have been brought about within that time.\r\nThe idea, therefore, of perpetual and progressive waste is constantly\r\npresent to the mind of every beholder; and as that part of the chasm,\r\nwhich has been the work of the last hundred and fifty years resembles\r\nprecisely, in depth, width, and character, the rest of the gorge which\r\nextends seven miles below, it is most natural to infer, that the entire\r\nravine has been hollowed out in the same manner, by the recession of the\r\ncataract.\r\n\r\nIt must at least be conceded, that the river supplies an adequate cause\r\nfor executing the whole task thus assigned to it, provided we grant\r\nsufficient time for its completion. As this part of the country was a\r\nwilderness till near the end of the last century, we can obtain no\r\naccurate data for estimating the exact rate at which the cataract has\r\nbeen receding. Mr. Bakewell, son of the eminent geologist of that name,\r\nwho visited the Niagara in 1829, made the first attempt to calculate\r\nfrom the observations of one who had lived forty years at the Falls, and\r\nwho had been the first settler there, that the cataract had during that\r\nperiod gone back about a yard annually. But after the most careful\r\ninquiries which I was able to make, during my visit to the spot in\r\n1841-2, I came to the conclusion that the average of one foot a year\r\nwould be a much more probable conjecture. In that case, it would have\r\nrequired thirty-five thousand years for the retreat of the Falls, from\r\nthe escarpment of Queenstown to their present site. It seems by no means\r\nimprobable that such a result would be no exaggeration of the truth,\r\nalthough we cannot assume that the retrograde movement has been uniform.\r\nAn examination of the geological structure of the district, as laid open\r\nin the ravine, shows that at every step in the process of excavation,\r\nthe height of the precipice, the hardness of the materials at its base,\r\nand the quantity of fallen matter to be removed, must have varied. At\r\nsome points it may have receded much faster than at present, but in\r\ngeneral its progress was probably slower, because the cataract, when it\r\nbegan to recede, must have had nearly twice its present height.\r\n\r\nFrom observations made by me in 1841, when I had the advantage of being\r\naccompanied by Mr. Hall, state geologist of New York, and in 1842, when\r\nI re-examined the Niagara district, I obtained geological evidence of\r\nthe former existence of an old river-bed, which, I have no doubt,\r\nindicates the original channel through which the waters once flowed from\r\nthe Falls to Queenstown, at the height of nearly three hundred feet\r\nabove the bottom of the present gorge. The geological monuments alluded\r\nto, consist of patches of sand and gravel, forty feet thick, containing\r\nfluviatile shells of the genera Unio, Cyclas, Melania, &c., such as now\r\ninhabit the waters of the Niagara above the Falls. The identity of the\r\nfossil species with the recent is unquestionable, and these freshwater\r\ndeposits occur at the edge of the cliffs bounding the ravine, so that\r\nthey prove the former extension of an elevated shallow valley, four\r\nmiles below the falls, a distinct prolongation of that now occupied by\r\nthe Niagara, in the elevated region intervening between Lake Erie and\r\nthe Falls. Whatever theory be framed for the hollowing out of the ravine\r\nfurther down, or for the three miles which intervene between the\r\nwhirlpool and Queenstown, it will always be necessary to suppose the\r\nformer existence of a barrier of _rock_, not of loose and destructible\r\nmaterials, such as those composing the drift in this district, somewhere\r\nimmediately below the whirlpool. By that barrier the waters were held\r\nback for ages, when the fluviatile deposit, 40 feet in thickness, and\r\n250 feet above the present channel of the river, originated. If we are\r\nled by this evidence to admit that the cataract has cut back its way for\r\nfour miles, we can have little hesitation in referring the excavation of\r\nthe remaining three miles below to a like agency, the shape of the chasm\r\nbeing precisely similar.\r\n\r\nThere have been many speculations respecting the future recession of the\r\nFalls, and the deluge that might be occasioned by the sudden escape of\r\nthe waters of Lake Erie, if the ravine should ever be prolonged 16 miles\r\nbackwards. But a more accurate knowledge of the geological succession of\r\nthe rocks, brought to light by the State Survey, has satisfied every\r\ngeologist that the Falls would diminish gradually in height before they\r\ntravelled back two miles, and in consequence of a gentle dip of the\r\nstrata to the south, the massive limestone now at the top would then be\r\nat their base, and would retard, and perhaps put an effectual stop to,\r\nthe excavating process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION OF SOLID MATTER BY ICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Carrying power of river-ice--Rocks annually conveyed into the St.\r\n    Lawrence by its tributaries--Ground-ice; its origin and transporting\r\n    power--Glaciers--Theory of their downward movement--Smoothed and\r\n    grooved rocks--The moraine unstratified--Icebergs covered with mud\r\n    and stones--Limits of glaciers and icebergs--Their effects on the\r\n    bottom when they run aground--Packing of coast-ice--Boulders drifted\r\n    by ice on coast of Labrador--Blocks moved by ice in the Baltic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe power of running water to carry sand, gravel, and fragments of rock\r\nto considerable distances is greatly augmented in those regions where,\r\nduring some part of the year, the frost is of sufficient intensity to\r\nconvert the water, either at the surface or bottom of rivers, into ice.\r\n\r\nThis subject may be considered under three different heads:--first, the\r\neffect of surface-ice and ground-ice in enabling streams to remove\r\ngravel and stones to a distance; secondly, the action of glaciers in the\r\ntransport of boulders, and in the polishing and scratching of rocks;\r\nthirdly, the floating off of glaciers charged with solid matter into the\r\nsea, and the drifting of icebergs and coast-ice.\r\n\r\n_River-ice._--Pebbles and small pieces of rock may be seen entangled in\r\nice, and floating annually down the Tay in Scotland, as far as the mouth\r\nof that river. Similar observations might doubtless be made respecting\r\nalmost all the larger rivers of England and Scotland; but there seems\r\nreason to suspect that the principal transfer from place to place of\r\npebbles and stones adhering to ice goes on unseen by us under water. For\r\nalthough the specific gravity of the compound mass may cause it to sink,\r\nit may still be very buoyant, and easily borne along by a feeble\r\ncurrent. The ice, moreover, melts very slowly at the bottom of running\r\nstreams in winter, as the water there is often nearly at the freezing\r\npoint, as will be seen from what will be said in the sequel of\r\nground-ice.\r\n\r\nAs we traverse Europe in the latitudes of Great Britain, we find the\r\nwinters more severe, and the rivers more regularly frozen over. M.\r\nLariviere relates that, being at Memel on the Baltic in 1821, when the\r\nice of the river Niemen broke up, he saw a mass of ice thirty feet long\r\nwhich had descended the stream, and had been thrown ashore. In the\r\nmiddle of it was a triangular piece of granite, about a yard in\r\ndiameter, resembling in composition the red granite of Finland.[283]\r\n\r\nWhen rivers in the northern hemisphere flow from south to north, the ice\r\nfirst breaks up in the higher part of their course, and the flooded\r\nwaters, bearing along large icy fragments, often arrive at parts of the\r\nstream which are still firmly frozen over. Great inundations are thus\r\nfrequently occasioned by the obstructions thrown in the way of the\r\ndescending waters, as in the case of the Mackenzie in North America, and\r\nthe Irtish, Obi, Yenesei, Lena, and other rivers of Siberia. (See map,\r\nfig. 1, p. 79.) A partial stoppage of this kind lately occurred (Jan.\r\n31, 1840) in the Vistula, about a mile and a half above the city of\r\nDantzic, where the river, choked up by packed ice, was made to take a\r\nnew course over its right bank, so that it hollowed out in a few days a\r\ndeep and broad channel, many leagues in length, through a tract of\r\nsand-hills which were from 40 to 60 feet high.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, where the winter's cold is intense, in a latitude\r\ncorresponding to that of central France, several tributaries of the St.\r\nLawrence begin to thaw in their upper course, while they remain frozen\r\nover lower down, and thus large slabs of ice are set free and thrown\r\nupon the unbroken sheet of ice below. Then begins what is called the\r\npacking of the drifted fragments; that is to say, one slab is made to\r\nslide over another, until a vast pile is built up, and the whole being\r\nfrozen together, is urged onwards by the force of the dammed up waters\r\nand drift-ice. Thus propelled, it not only forces along boulders, but\r\nbreaks off from cliffs, which border the rivers, huge pieces of\r\nprojecting rock. By this means several buttresses of solid masonry,\r\nwhich, up to the year 1836, supported a wooden bridge on the St.\r\nMaurice, which falls into the St. Lawrence, near the town of Trois\r\nRivieres, lat. 46 degrees 20 minutes, were thrown down, and conveyed by\r\nthe ice into the main river; and instances have occurred at Montreal of\r\nwharfs and stone-buildings, from 30 to 50 feet square, having been\r\nremoved in a similar manner. We learn from Captain Bayfield that anchors\r\nlaid down within high-water mark, to secure vessels hauled on shore for\r\nthe winter, must be cut out of the ice on the approach of spring, or\r\nthey would be carried away. In 1834, the Gulnare's bower-anchor,\r\nweighing half a ton, was transported some yards by the ice, and so\r\nfirmly was it fixed, that the force of the moving ice broke a\r\nchain-cable suited for a 10-gun brig, and which had rode the Gulnare\r\nduring the heaviest gales in the gulf. Had not this anchor been cut out\r\nof the ice, it would have been earned into deep water and lost.[284]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.\r\n\r\nBOULDERS DRIFTED BY ICE ON SHORES OF THE ST. LAWRENCE\r\n\r\nView taken by Lieut. Bowen, from the N. E., in the Spring of 1835, at\r\nRichelieu Rapid, lat. 46 degrees N.]\r\n\r\nThe scene represented in the annexed plate (pl. 2), from a drawing by\r\nLieutenant Bowen, R. N., will enable the reader to comprehend the\r\nincessant changes which the transport of boulders produces annually on\r\nthe low islands, shores, and bed of the St. Lawrence above Quebec. The\r\nfundamental rocks at Richelieu Rapid, situated in lat. 46 degrees N., are\r\nlimestone and slate, which are seen at low-water to be covered with\r\nboulders of granite. These boulders owe their spheroidal form chiefly to\r\nweathering, or action of frost, which causes the surface to exfoliate\r\nin concentric plates, so that all the more prominent angles are removed.\r\nAt the point _a_ is a cavity in the mud or sand of the beach, now filled\r\nwith water, which was occupied during the preceding winter (1835) by the\r\nhuge erratic _b_, a mass of granite, 70 tons' weight, found in the\r\nspring following (1836) at a distance of several feet from its former\r\nposition. Many small islands are seen on the river, such as _c d_, which\r\nafford still more striking proofs of the carrying and propelling power\r\nof ice. These islets are never under water, yet every winter ice is\r\nthrown upon them in such abundance, that it _packs_ to the height of 20,\r\nand even 30 feet, bringing with it a continual supply of large stones or\r\nboulders, and carrying away others; the greatest number being deposited,\r\naccording to Lieutenant Bowen, on the edge of deep water. On the island\r\n_d_, on the left of the accompanying view, a lighthouse is represented,\r\nconsisting of a square wooden building, which having no other foundation\r\nthan the boulders, requires to be taken down every winter, and rebuilt\r\non the reopening of the river.\r\n\r\nThese effects of frost, which are so striking on the St. Lawrence above\r\nQuebec, are by no means displayed on a smaller scale below that city,\r\nwhere the gulf rises and falls with the tide. On the contrary; it is in\r\nthe estuary, between the latitudes 47 degrees and 49 degrees, that the\r\ngreatest quantity of gravel and boulders of large dimensions are carried\r\ndown annually towards the sea. Here the frost is so intense, that a\r\ndense sheet of ice is formed at low water, which, on the rise of the\r\ntide, is lifted up, broken, and thrown in heaps on the extensive shoals\r\nwhich border the estuary. When the tide recedes, this packed ice is\r\nexposed to a temperature sometimes 30 degrees below zero, which freezes\r\ntogether all the loose pieces of ice, as well as the granitic and other\r\nboulders. The whole of these are often swept away by a high tide, or\r\nwhen the river is swollen by the melting of the snow in Spring. One huge\r\nblock of granite, 15 feet long by 10 feet both in width and height, and\r\nestimated to contain 1500 cubic feet, was conveyed in this manner to\r\nsome distance in the year 1837, its previous position being well known,\r\nas up to that time it had been used by Captain Bayfield as a mark for\r\nthe surveying station.\r\n\r\n_Ground-ice._--When a current of cold air passes over the surface of a\r\nlake or stream it abstracts from it a quantity of heat, and the specific\r\ngravity of the water being thereby increased, the cooled portion sinks.\r\nThis circulation may continue until the whole body of fluid has been\r\ncooled down to the temperature of 40 degrees F., after which, if the cold\r\nincrease, the vertical movement ceases, the water which is uppermost\r\nexpands and floats over the heavier fluid below, and when it has\r\nattained a temperature of 32 degrees Fahr. it sets into a sheet of ice. It\r\nshould seem therefore impossible, according to this law of congelation,\r\nthat ice should ever form at the bottom of a river; and yet such is the\r\nfact, and many speculations have been hazarded to account for so\r\nsingular a phenomenon. M. Arago is of opinion that the mechanical action\r\nof a running stream produces a circulation by which the entire body of\r\nwater is mixed up together, and cooled alike, and the whole being thus\r\nreduced to the freezing point, ice begins to form at the bottom for two\r\nreasons, first, because there is less motion there, and secondly,\r\nbecause the water is in contact with solid rock or pebbles which have a\r\ncold surface.[285] Whatever explanation we adopt, there is no doubt of\r\nthe fact, that in countries where the intensity and duration of the cold\r\nis great, rivers and torrents acquire an increase of carrying power by\r\nthe formation of what is called ground-ice. Even in the Thames we learn\r\nfrom Dr. Plott that pieces of this kind of ice, having gravel frozen on\r\nto their under side, rise up from the bottom in winter, and float on the\r\nsurface. In the Siberian rivers, Weitz describes large stones as having\r\nbeen brought up from the river's bed in the same manner, and made to\r\nfloat.[286]\r\n\r\n_Glaciers._--In the temperate zone, the snow lies for months in winter\r\non the summit of every high mountain, while in the arctic regions, a\r\nlong summer's day of half a year's duration is insufficient to melt the\r\nsnow, even on land just raised above the level of the sea. It is\r\ntherefore not surprising, since the atmosphere becomes colder in\r\nproportion as we ascend in it, that there should be heights, even in\r\ntropical countries, where the snow never melts. The lowest limit to\r\nwhich the perpetual snow extends downwards, from the tops of mountains\r\nat the equator, is an elevation of not less than 16,000 feet above the\r\nsea; while in the Swiss Alps, in lat. 46 degrees N. it reaches as low as\r\n8,500 feet above the same level, the loftier peaks of the Alpine chain\r\nbeing from 12,000 to 15,000 feet high. The frozen mass augmenting from\r\nyear to year would add indefinitely to the altitude of alpine summits,\r\nwere it not relieved by its descent through the larger and deeper\r\nvalleys to regions far below the general snow-line. To these it slowly\r\nfinds its way in the form of rivers of ice, called glaciers, the\r\nconsolidation of which is produced by pressure, and by the congelation\r\nof water infiltered into the porous mass, which is always undergoing\r\npartial liquefaction, and receiving in summer occasional showers of rain\r\non its surface. In a day of hot sunshine, or mild rain, innumerable\r\nrills of pure and sparkling water run in icy channels along the surface\r\nof the glaciers, which in the night shrink, and come to nothing. They\r\nare often precipitated in bold cascades into deep fissures in the ice,\r\nand contribute together with springs to form torrents, which flow in\r\ntunnels at the bottom of the glaciers for many a league, and at length\r\nissue at their extremities, from beneath beautiful caverns or arches.\r\nThe waters of these streams are always densely charged with the finest\r\nmud, produced by the grinding of rock and sand under the weight of the\r\nmoving mass. (See fig. 18.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 18.\r\n\r\nGlacier with medial and lateral moraines and with terminal cave.]\r\n\r\nThe length of the Swiss glaciers is sometimes twenty miles, their width\r\nin the middle portion, where they are broadest, occasionally two or\r\nthree miles; their depth or thickness sometimes more than 600 feet. When\r\nthey descend steep slopes, and precipices, or are forced through narrow\r\ngorges, the ice is broken up, and assumes the most fantastic and\r\npicturesque forms, with lofty peaks and pinnacles, projecting above the\r\ngeneral level. These snow-white masses are often relieved by a dark\r\nbackground of pines, as in the valley of Chamouni; and are not only\r\nsurrounded with abundance of the wild rhododendron in full flower, but\r\nencroach still lower into the region of cultivation, and trespass on\r\nfields where the tobacco-plant is flourishing by the side of the\r\npeasant's hut.\r\n\r\nThe cause of glacier motion has of late been a subject of careful\r\ninvestigation and much keen controversy. Although a question of physics,\r\nrather than of geology, it is too interesting to allow me to pass it by\r\nwithout some brief mention. De Saussure, whose travels in the Alps are\r\nfull of original observations, as well as sound and comprehensive\r\ngeneral views, conceived that the weight of the ice might be sufficient\r\nto urge it down the slope of the valley, if the sliding motion were\r\naided by the water flowing at the bottom. For this \"gravitation theory\"\r\nCharpentier, followed by Agassiz, substituted the hypothesis of\r\ndilatation. The most solid ice is always permeable to water, and\r\npenetrated by innumerable fissures and capillary tubes, often extremely\r\nminute. These tubes imbibe the aqueous fluid during the day, which\r\nfreezes, it is said, in the cold of the night, and expands while in the\r\nact of congelation. The distension of the whole mass exerts an immense\r\nforce, tending to propel the glacier in the direction of least\r\nresistance--\"in other words, down the valley.\" This theory was opposed\r\nby Mr. Hopkins on mathematical and mechanical grounds, in several able\r\npapers. Among other objections, he pointed out that the friction of so\r\nenormous a body as a glacier on its bed is so great, that the vertical\r\ndirection would always be that of least resistance, and if a\r\nconsiderable distension of the mass should take place, by the action of\r\nfreezing, it would tend to increase its thickness, rather than\r\naccelerate its downward progress. He also contended (and his arguments\r\nwere illustrated by many ingenious experiments), that a glacier can move\r\nalong an extremely slight slope, solely by the influence of gravitation,\r\nowing to the constant dissolution of ice in contact with the rocky\r\nbottom, and the number of separate fragments into which the glacier is\r\ndivided by fissures, so that freedom of motion is imparted to its\r\nseveral parts somewhat resembling that of an imperfect fluid. To this\r\nview Professor James Forbes objected, that gravitation would not supply\r\nan adequate cause for the sliding of solid ice down slopes having an\r\ninclination of no more than four or five degrees, still less would it\r\nexplain how the glacier advances where the channel expands and\r\ncontracts. The Mer de Glace in Chamouni, for example, after being 2000\r\nyards wide, passes through a strait only 900 yards in width. Such a\r\ngorge, it is contended, would be choked up by the advance of any solid\r\nmass, even if it be broken up into numerous fragments. The same acute\r\nobserver remarked, that water in the fissures and pores of glaciers\r\ncannot, and does not part with its latent heat, so as to freeze every\r\nnight to a great depth, or far in the interior of the mass. Had the\r\ndilatation theory been true, the chief motion of the glacier would have\r\noccurred about sunset, when the freezing of the water must be greatest,\r\nand it had, in fact, been at first assumed by those who favored that\r\nhypothesis, that the mass moved faster at the sides, where the melting\r\nof ice was promoted by the sun's heat, reflected from boundary\r\nprecipices.\r\n\r\nAgassiz appears to have been the first to commence, in 1841, aided by a\r\nskilful engineer, M. Escher de la Linth, a series of exact measurements\r\nto ascertain the laws of glacier motion, and he soon discovered,\r\ncontrary to his preconceived notions, that the stream of ice moved more\r\nslowly at the sides than at the centre, and faster in the middle region\r\nof the glacier than at its extremity.[287] Professor James Forbes, who\r\nhad joined Mr. Agassiz during his earlier investigations in the Alps,\r\nundertook himself an independent series of experiments, which he\r\nfollowed up with great perseverance, to determine the laws of glacier\r\nmotion. These he found to agree very closely with the laws governing the\r\ncourse of rivers, their progress being greater in the centre than at the\r\nsides, and more rapid at the surface than at the bottom. This fact was\r\nverified by carefully fixing a great number of marks in the ice,\r\narranged in a straight line, which gradually assumed a beautiful curve,\r\nthe middle part pointing down the glacier, and showing a velocity there,\r\ndouble or treble that of the lateral parts.[288] He ascertained that the\r\nrate of advance by night was nearly the same as by day, and that even\r\nthe hourly march of the icy stream could be detected, although the\r\nprogress might not amount to more than six or seven inches in twelve\r\nhours. By the incessant though invisible advance of the marks placed on\r\nthe ice, \"time,\" says Mr. Forbes, \"was marked out as by a shadow on a\r\ndial, and the unequivocal evidence which I obtained, that even while\r\nwalking on a glacier we are, day by day, and hour by hour, imperceptibly\r\ncarried on by the resistless flow of the icy stream, filled me with\r\nadmiration.\" (Travels in the Alps, p. 133.) In order to explain this\r\nremarkable regularity of motion, and its obedience to laws so strictly\r\nanalogous to those of fluids, the same writer proposed the theory that\r\nthe ice, instead of being solid and compact, is a viscous or plastic\r\nbody, capable of yielding to great pressure, and the more so in\r\nproportion as its temperature is higher, and as it approaches more\r\nnearly to the melting point. He endeavors to show that this hypothesis\r\nwill account for many complicated phenomena, especially for a ribboned\r\nor veined structure which is everywhere observable in the ice, and might\r\nbe produced by lines of discontinuity, arising from the different rates\r\nat which the various portions of the semi-rigid glacier advance and pass\r\neach other. Many examples are adduced to prove that a glacier can model\r\nitself to the form of the ground over which it is forced, exactly as\r\nwould happen if it possessed a certain ductility, and this power of\r\nyielding under intense pressure, is shown not to be irreconcilable with\r\nthe idea of the ice being sufficiently compact to break into fragments,\r\nwhen the strain upon its parts is excessive; as where the glacier turns\r\na sharp angle, or descends upon a rapid or convex slope. The increased\r\nvelocity in summer is attributed partly to the greater plasticity of the\r\nice, when not exposed to intense cold, and partly to the hydrostatic\r\npressure of the water in the capillary tubes, which imbibe more of this\r\nliquid in the hot season.\r\n\r\nOn the assumption of the ice being a rigid mass, Mr. Hopkins attributed\r\nthe more rapid motions in the centre to the unequal rate at which the\r\nbroad stripes of ice, intervening between longitudinal fissures,\r\nadvance; but besides that there are parts of the glacier where no such\r\nfissures exist, such a mode of progression, says Mr. Forbes, would cause\r\nthe borders of large transverse rents or \"crevasses,\" to be jagged like\r\na saw, instead of being perfectly even and straight-edged.[289] An\r\nexperiment recently made by Mr. Christie, secretary to the Royal\r\nSociety, appears to demonstrate that ice, under great pressure,\r\npossesses a sufficient degree of moulding and self-adapting power to\r\nallow it to be acted upon, as if it were a pasty substance. A hollow\r\nshell of iron an inch and a half thick, the interior being ten inches in\r\ndiameter, was filled with water, in the course of a severe winter, and\r\nexposed to the frost, with the fuze-hole uppermost. A portion of the\r\nwater expanded in freezing, so as to protrude a cylinder of ice from the\r\nfuze-hole; and this cylinder continued to grow inch by inch in\r\nproportion as the central nucleus of water froze. As we cannot doubt\r\nthat an outer shell of ice is first formed, and then another within, the\r\ncontinued rise of the column through the fuze-hole must proceed from the\r\nsqueezing of successive shells of ice concentrically formed, through the\r\nnarrow orifice; and yet the protruded cylinder consisted of entire, and\r\nnot fragmentary ice.[290]\r\n\r\nThe agency of glaciers in producing permanent geological changes\r\nconsists partly in their power of transporting gravel, sand, and huge\r\nstones to great distances, and partly in the smoothing, polishing, and\r\nscoring of their rocky channels, and the boundary walls of the valleys\r\nthrough which they pass. At the foot of every steep cliff or precipice\r\nin high Alpine regions, a talus is seen of rocky fragments detached by\r\nthe alternate action of frost and thaw. If these loose masses, instead\r\nof accumulating on a stationary base, happen to fall upon a glacier,\r\nthey will move along with it, and, in place of a single heap, they will\r\nform in the course of years a long stream of blocks. If a glacier be 20\r\nmiles long, and its annual progression about 500 feet, it will require\r\nabout two centuries for a block thus lodged upon its surface to travel\r\ndown from the higher to the lower regions, or to the extremity of the\r\nicy mass. This terminal point remains usually unchanged from year to\r\nyear, although every part of the ice is in motion, because the\r\nliquefaction by heat is just sufficient to balance the onward movement\r\nof the glacier, which may be compared to an endless file of soldiers,\r\npouring into a breach, and shot down as fast as they advance.\r\n\r\nThe stones carried along on the ice are called in Switzerland the\r\n\"moraines\" of the glacier. There is always one line of blocks on each\r\nside or edge of the icy stream, and often several in the middle, where\r\nthey are arranged in long ridges or mounds, often several yards high.\r\n(See fig. 18, p. 223.) The cause of these \"medial moraines\" was first\r\nexplained by Agassiz, who referred them to the confluence of tributary\r\nglaciers.[291] Upon the union of two streams of ice, the right lateral\r\nmoraine of one of the streams comes in contact with the left lateral\r\nmoraine of the other, and they afterwards move on together, in the\r\ncentre, if the confluent glaciers are equal in size, or nearer to one\r\nside if unequal.\r\n\r\nAll sand and fragments of soft stone which fall through fissures and\r\nreach the bottom of the glaciers, or which are interposed between the\r\nglacier and the steep sides of the valley, are pushed along, and ground\r\ndown into mud, while the larger and harder fragments have their angles\r\nworn off. At the same time the fundamental and boundary rocks are\r\nsmoothed and polished, and often scored with parallel furrows, or with\r\nlines and scratches produced by hard minerals, such as crystals of\r\nquartz, which act like the diamond upon glass.[292] This effect is\r\nperfectly different from that caused by the action of water, or a muddy\r\ntorrent forcing along heavy fragments; for when stones are fixed firmly\r\nin the ice, and pushed along by it under great pressure, in straight\r\nlines, they scoop out long rectilinear furrows or grooves parallel to\r\neach other.[293] The discovery of such markings at various heights far\r\nabove the surface of the existing glaciers and for miles beyond their\r\npresent terminations, affords geological evidence of the former\r\nextension of the ice beyond its present limits in Switzerland and other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe moraine of the glacier, observes Charpentier, is entirely devoid of\r\nstratification, for there has been no sorting of the materials, as in\r\nthe case of sand, mud, and pebbles, when deposited by running water. The\r\nice transports indifferently, and to the same spots, the heaviest blocks\r\nand the finest particles, mingling all together, and leaving them in one\r\nconfused and promiscuous heap wherever it melts.[294]\r\n\r\n_Icebergs._--In countries situated in high northern latitudes, like\r\nSpitzbergen, between 70 degrees and 80 degrees N., glaciers, loaded with\r\nmud and rock, descend to the sea, and there huge fragments of them float\r\noff and become icebergs. Scoresby counted 500 of these bergs drifting\r\nalong in latitudes 69 degrees and 70 degrees N., which rose above the\r\nsurface from the height of 100 to 200 feet, and measured from a few\r\nyards to a mile in circumference.[295] Many of them were loaded with\r\nbeds of earth and rock of such thickness, that the weight was\r\nconjectured to be from 50,000 to 100,000 tons. Specimens of the rocks\r\nwere obtained, and among them were granite, gneiss, mica-schist,\r\nclay-slate, granular felspar, and greenstone. Such bergs must be of\r\ngreat magnitude; because the mass of ice below the level of the water is\r\nabout eight times greater than that above. Wherever they are dissolved,\r\nit is evident that the \"moraine\" will fall to the bottom of the sea. In\r\nthis manner may submarine valleys, mountains, and platforms become\r\nstrewed over with gravel, sand, mud, and scattered blocks of foreign\r\nrock, of a nature perfectly dissimilar from all in the vicinity, and\r\nwhich may have been transported across unfathomable abysses. If the\r\nbergs happen to melt in still water, so that the earthy and stony\r\nmaterials may fall tranquilly to the bottom, the deposit will probably\r\nbe unstratified, like the terminal moraine of a glacier; but whenever\r\nthe materials are under the influence of a current of water as they\r\nfall, they will be sorted and arranged according to their relative\r\nweight and size, and therefore more or less perfectly stratified.\r\n\r\nIn a former chapter it was stated that some ice islands have been known\r\nto drift from Baffin's Bay to the Azores, and from the South Pole to the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of the Cape of Good Hope, so that the area over\r\nwhich the effects of moving ice may be experienced, comprehends a large\r\nportion of the globe.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Von Buch that the most southern point on the continent of\r\nEurope at which a glacier comes down to the sea is in Norway, in lat.\r\n67 degrees N.[296] But Mr. Darwin has shown, that they extend to the\r\nsea, in South America, in latitudes more than 20 degrees nearer the\r\nequator than in Europe; as, for example, in Chili, where, in the Gulf of\r\nPenas, lat. 46 degrees 40 minutes S., or the latitude of central France;\r\nand in Sir George Eyre's Sound, in the latitude of Paris, they give\r\norigin to icebergs, which were seen in 1834 carrying angular pieces of\r\ngranite, and stranding them in fiords, where the shores were composed of\r\nclay-slate.[297] A large proportion, however, of the ice-islands seen\r\nfloating both in the northern and southern hemispheres, are probably not\r\ngenerated by glaciers, but rather by the accumulation of coast ice. When\r\nthe sea freezes at the base of a lofty precipice, the sheet of ice is\r\nprevented from adhering to the land by the rise and fall of the tide.\r\nNevertheless, it often continues on the shore at the foot of the cliff,\r\nand receives accessions of drift snow blown from the land. Under the\r\nweight of this snow the ice sinks slowly if the water be deep, and the\r\nsnow is gradually converted into ice by partial liquefaction and\r\nre-congelation. In this manner, islands of ice of great thickness and\r\nmany leagues in length, originate, and are eventually blown out to sea\r\nby off-shore winds. In their interior are inclosed many fragments of\r\nstone which had fallen upon them from overhanging cliffs during their\r\nformation. Such floating icebergs are commonly flat-topped, but their\r\nlower portions are liable to melt in latitudes where the ocean at a\r\nmoderate depth is usually warmer than the surface water and the air.\r\nHence their centre of gravity changes continually, and they turn over\r\nand assume very irregular shapes.\r\n\r\nIn a voyage of discovery made in the antarctic regions in 1839, a\r\ndark-colored angular mass of rock was seen imbedded in an iceberg,\r\ndrifting along in mid-ocean in lat. 61 degrees S. That part of the rock\r\nwhich was visible was about 12 feet in height, and from 5 to 6 in width,\r\nbut the dark color of the surrounding ice indicated that much more of\r\nthe stone was concealed. A sketch made by Mr. Macnab, when the vessel\r\nwas within a quarter of a mile of it, is now published.[298] This\r\niceberg, one of many observed at sea on the same day, was between 250\r\nand 300 feet high, and was no less than 1400 miles from any certainly\r\nknown land. It is exceedingly improbable, says Mr. Darwin, in his notice\r\nof this phenomenon, that any land will hereafter be discovered within\r\n100 miles of the spot, and it must be remembered that the erratic was\r\nstill firmly fixed in the ice, and may have sailed for many a league\r\nfarther before it dropped to the bottom.[299]\r\n\r\nCaptain Sir James Ross, in his antarctic voyage in 1841, 42, and 43, saw\r\nmultitudes of icebergs transporting stones and rocks of various sizes,\r\nwith frozen mud, in high southern latitudes. His companion, Dr. J.\r\nHooker, informs me that he came to the conclusion that most of the\r\nsouthern icebergs have stones in them, although they are usually\r\nconcealed from view by the quantity of snow which falls upon them.\r\n\r\nIn the account given by Messrs. Dease and Simpson, of their recent\r\narctic discoveries, we learn that in lat. 71 degrees N., long. 156\r\ndegrees W., they found \"a long low spit, named Point Barrow, composed of\r\ngravel and coarse sand, in some parts more than a quarter of a mile\r\nbroad, which the pressure of the ice had forced up into numerous mounds,\r\nthat, viewed from a distance, assumed the appearance of huge boulder\r\nrocks.\"[300]\r\n\r\nThis fact is important, as showing how masses of drift ice, when\r\nstranding on submarine banks, may exert a lateral pressure capable of\r\nbending and dislocating any yielding strata of gravel, sand, or mud. The\r\nbanks on which icebergs occasionally run aground between Baffin's Bay\r\nand Newfoundland, are many hundred feet under water, and the force with\r\nwhich they are struck will depend not so much on the velocity as the\r\nmomentum of the floating ice-islands. The same berg is often carried\r\naway by a change of wind, and then driven back again upon the same bank,\r\nor it is made to rise and fall by the waves of the ocean, so that it may\r\nalternately strike the bottom with its whole weight, and then be lifted\r\nup again until it has deranged the superficial beds over a wide area. In\r\nthis manner the geologist may account, perhaps, for the circumstance\r\nthat in Scandinavia, Scotland, and other countries where erratics are\r\nmet with, the beds of sand, loam, and gravel are often vertical, bent,\r\nand contorted into the most complicated folds, while the underlying\r\nstrata, although composed of equally pliant materials, are horizontal.\r\nBut some of these curvatures of loose strata may also have been due to\r\nrepeated alternations of layers of gravel and sand, ice and snow, the\r\nmelting of the latter having caused the intercalated beds of\r\nindestructible matter to assume their present anomalous position.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that icebergs must often break off the peaks\r\nand projecting points of submarine mountains, and must grate upon and\r\npolish their surface, furrowing or scratching them in precisely the same\r\nway as we have seen that glaciers act on the solid rocks over which they\r\nare propelled.[301]\r\n\r\nTo conclude: it appears that large stones, mud, and gravel are carried\r\ndown by the ice of rivers, estuaries, and glaciers, into the sea, where\r\nthe tides and currents of the ocean, aided by the wind, cause them to\r\ndrift for hundreds of miles from the place of their origin. Although it\r\nwill belong more properly to the seventh and eighth chapters to treat of\r\nthe transportation of solid matter by the movements of the ocean, I\r\nshall add here what I have farther to say on this subject in connection\r\nwith ice.\r\n\r\nThe saline matter which sea-water holds in solution, prevents its\r\ncongelation, except where the most intense cold prevails. But the\r\ndrifting of the snow from the land often renders the surface-water\r\nbrackish near the coast, so that a sheet of ice is readily formed there,\r\nand by this means a large quantity of gravel is frequently conveyed from\r\nplace to place, and heavy boulders also, when the coast-ice is packed\r\ninto dense masses. Both the large and small stones thus conveyed usually\r\ntravel in one direction like shingle-beaches, and this was observed to\r\ntake place on the coast of Labrador and Gulf of St. Lawrence, between\r\nthe latitudes 50 degrees and 60 degrees N., by Capt. Bayfield, during\r\nhis late survey. The line of coast alluded to is strewed over for a\r\ndistance of 700 miles with ice-borne boulders, often 6 feet in diameter,\r\nwhich are for the most part on their way from north to south, or in the\r\ndirection of the prevailing current. Some points on this coast have been\r\nobserved to be occasionally deserted, and then again at another season\r\nthickly bestrewed with erratics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.\r\n\r\nBoulders, chiefly of granite, stranded by ice on the coast of Labrador,\r\nbetween lat. 50 degrees and 60 degrees N. (Lieut. Bowen, R. N.)]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying drawing (fig. 19), for which I am indebted to Lieut.\r\nBowen, R. N., represents the ordinary appearance of the Labrador coast,\r\nbetween the latitudes of 50 degrees and 60 degrees N. Countless blocks,\r\nchiefly granitic, and of various sizes, are seen lying between high and\r\nlow-water mark. Capt. Bayfield saw similar masses carried by ice through\r\nthe Straits of Belle Isle, between Newfoundland and the American\r\ncontinent, which he conceives may have travelled in the course of years\r\nfrom Baffin's Bay, a distance which may be compared in our hemisphere to\r\nthe drifting of erratics from Lapland and Iceland as far south as\r\nGermany, France, and England.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked in what manner have these blocks been originally\r\ndetached? We may answer that some have fallen from precipitous cliffs,\r\nothers have been lifted up from the bottom of the sea, adhering by their\r\ntops to the ice, while others have been brought down by rivers and\r\nglaciers.\r\n\r\nThe erratics of North America are sometimes angular, but most of them\r\nhave been rounded either by friction or decomposition. The granite of\r\nCanada, as before remarked (p. 221 ), has a tendency to concentric\r\nexfoliation, and scales off in spheroidal coats when exposed to the\r\nspray of the sea during severe frosts. The range of the thermometer in\r\nthat country usually exceeds, in the course of the year, 100 degrees, and\r\nsometimes 120 degrees F.; and, to prevent the granite used in the\r\nbuildings of Quebec from peeling off in winter, it is necessary to oil\r\nand paint the squared stones.\r\n\r\nIn parts of the Baltic, such as the Gulf of Bothnia, where the quantity\r\nof salt in the water amounts in general to one fourth only of that in\r\nthe ocean, the entire surface freezes over in winter to the depth of 5\r\nor 6 feet. Stones are thus frozen in, and afterwards lifted up about 3\r\nfeet perpendicularly on the melting of the snow in summer, and then\r\ncarried by floating ice-islands to great distances. Professor Von Baer\r\nstates, in a communication on this subject to the Academy of St.\r\nPetersburg, that a block of granite, weighing a million of pounds, was\r\ncarried by ice during the winter of 1837-8 from Finland to the island of\r\nHockland, and two other huge blocks were transported about the years\r\n1806 and 1814 by packed ice on the south coast of Finland, according to\r\nthe testimony of the pilots and inhabitants, one block having travelled\r\nabout a quarter of a mile, and lying about 18 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea.[302]\r\n\r\nMore recently Dr. Forchhammer has shown that in the Sound, the Great\r\nBelt, and other places near the entrance of the Baltic, ground-ice forms\r\nplentifully at the bottom and then rises to the surface, charged with\r\nsand and gravel, stones and sea-weed. Sheets of ice, also, with included\r\nboulders, are driven up on the coast during storms, and \"packed\" to a\r\nheight of 50 feet. To the motion of such masses, but still more to that\r\nof the ground-ice, the Danish professor attributes the striation of\r\nrocky surfaces, forming the shores and bed of the sea, and he relates a\r\nstriking fact to prove that large quantities of rocky fragments are\r\nannually carried by ice out of the Baltic. \"In the year 1807,\" he says,\r\n\"at the time of the bombardment of the Danish fleet, an English\r\nsloop-of-war, riding at anchor in the roads at Copenhagen, blew up. In\r\n1844, or thirty-seven years afterwards, one of our divers, known to be\r\na trustworthy man, went down to save whatever might yet remain in the\r\nshipwrecked vessel. He found the space between decks entire, but covered\r\nwith blocks from 6 to 8 cubic feet in size, and some of them heaped one\r\nupon the other. He also affirmed, that all the sunk ships which he had\r\nvisited in the Sound, were in like manner strewed over with blocks.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Forchhammer also informs us, that during an intense frost in\r\nFebruary, 1844, the Sound was suddenly frozen over, and sheets of ice,\r\ndriven by a storm, were heaped up at the bottom of the Bay of Taarbeijk,\r\nthreatening to destroy a fishing-village on the shore. The whole was\r\nsoon frozen together into one mass, and forced up on the beach, forming\r\na mound more than 16 feet high, which threw down the walls of several\r\nbuildings. \"When I visited the spot next day, I saw ridges of ice, sand,\r\nand pebbles, not only on the shore, but extending far out into the\r\nbottom of the sea, showing how greatly its bed had been changed, and how\r\neasily, where it is composed of rock, it may be furrowed and streaked by\r\nstones firmly fixed in the moving ice.\"[303]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nPHENOMENA OF SPRINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n Origin of Springs--Artesian wells--Borings at Paris--Distinct causes\r\n    by which mineral and thermal waters may be raised to the\r\n    surface--Their connection with volcanic agency--Calcareous\r\n    springs--Travertin of the Elsa--Baths of San Vignone and of San\r\n    Filippo, near Radicofani--Spheroidal structure in travertin--Lake of\r\n    the Solfatara, near Rome--Travertin at Cascade of Tivoli--Gypseous,\r\n    siliceous, and ferruginous springs--Brine springs--Carbonated\r\n    springs--Disintegration of granite in Auvergne--Petroleum\r\n    springs--Pitch lake of Trinidad.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Origin of springs._--The action of running water on the surface of the\r\nland having been considered, we may next turn our attention to what may\r\nbe termed \"the subterranean drainage,\" or the phenomena of springs.\r\nEvery one is familiar with the fact, that certain porous soils, such as\r\nloose sand and gravel, absorb water with rapidity, and that the ground\r\ncomposed of them soon dries up after heavy showers. If a well be sunk in\r\nsuch soils, we often penetrate to considerable depths before we meet\r\nwith water; but this is usually found on our approaching the lower parts\r\nof the formation, where it rests on some impervious bed; for here the\r\nwater, unable to make its way downwards in a direct line, accumulates as\r\nin a reservoir, and is ready to ooze out into any opening which may be\r\nmade, in the same manner as we see the salt water flow into, and fill,\r\nany hollow which we dig in the sands of the shore at low tide.\r\n\r\nThe facility with which water can percolate loose and gravelly soils is\r\nclearly illustrated by the effect of the tides in the Thames between\r\nRichmond and London. The river, in this part of its course, flows\r\nthrough a bed of gravel overlying clay, and the porous superstratum is\r\nalternately saturated by the water of the Thames as the tide rises, and\r\nthen drained again to the distance of several hundred feet from the\r\nbanks when the tide falls, so that the wells in this tract regularly ebb\r\nand flow.\r\n\r\nIf the transmission of water through a porous medium be so rapid, we\r\ncannot be surprised that springs should be thrown out on the side of a\r\nhill, where the upper set of strata consist of chalk, sand, or other\r\npermeable substances, while the subjacent are composed of clay or other\r\nretentive soils. The only difficulty, indeed, is to explain why the\r\nwater does not ooze out everywhere along the line of junction of the two\r\nformations, so as to form one continuous land-soak, instead of a few\r\nsprings only, and these far distant from each other. The principal cause\r\nof this concentration of the waters at a few points is, first, the\r\nfrequency of rents and fissures, which act as natural drains; secondly,\r\nthe existence of inequalities in the upper surface of the impermeable\r\nstratum, which lead the water, as valleys do on the external surface of\r\na country, into certain low levels and channels.\r\n\r\nThat the generality of springs owe their supply to the atmosphere is\r\nevident from this, that they become languid, or entirely cease to flow,\r\nafter long droughts, and are again replenished after a continuance of\r\nrain. Many of them are probably indebted for the constancy and\r\nuniformity of their volume to the great extent of the subterranean\r\nreservoirs with which they communicate, and the time required for these\r\nto empty themselves by percolation. Such a gradual and regulated\r\ndischarge is exhibited, though in a less perfect degree, in every great\r\nlake which is not sensibly affected in its level by sudden showers, but\r\nonly slightly raised; so that its channel of efflux, instead of being\r\nswollen suddenly like the bed of a torrent, is enabled to carry off the\r\nsurplus water gradually.\r\n\r\nMuch light has been thrown, of late years, on the theory of springs, by\r\nthe boring of what are called by the French \"Artesian wells,\" because\r\nthe method has long been known and practised in Artois; and it is now\r\ndemonstrated that there are sheets, and in some places currents of fresh\r\nwater, at various depths in the earth. The instrument employed in\r\nexcavating these wells is a large augur, and the cavity bored is usually\r\nfrom three to four inches in diameter. If a hard rock is met with, it is\r\nfirst triturated by an iron rod, and the materials being thus reduced to\r\nsmall fragments or powder, are readily extracted. To hinder the sides of\r\nthe well from falling in, as also to prevent the spreading of the\r\nascending water in the surrounding soil, a jointed pipe is introduced,\r\nformed of wood in Artois, but in other countries more commonly of metal.\r\nIt frequently happens that, after passing through hundreds of feet of\r\nretentive soils, a water-bearing stratum is at length pierced, when the\r\nfluid immediately ascends to the surface, and flows over. The first rush\r\nof the water up the tube is often violent, so that for a time the water\r\nplays like a fountain, and then, sinking, continues to flow over\r\ntranquilly, or sometimes remains stationary at a certain depth below the\r\norifice of the well. This spouting of the water in the first instance is\r\nprobably owing to the disengagement of air and carbonic acid gas, for\r\nboth of these have been seen to bubble up with the water.[304]\r\n\r\nAt Sheerness, at the mouth of the Thames, a well was bored on a low\r\ntongue of land near the sea, through 300 feet of the blue clay of\r\nLondon, below which a bed of sand and pebbles was entered, belonging,\r\ndoubtless, to the plastic clay formation; when this stratum was pierced,\r\nthe water burst up with impetuosity, and filled the well. By another\r\nperforation at the same place, the water was found at the depth of 328\r\nfeet below the surface clay; it first rose rapidly to the height of 189\r\nfeet, and then, in the course of a few hours, ascended to an elevation\r\nof eight feet above the level of the ground. In 1824 a well was dug at\r\nFulham, near the Thames, at the Bishop of London's, to the depth of 317\r\nfeet, which, after traversing the tertiary strata, was continued through\r\n67 feet of chalk. The water immediately rose to the surface, and the\r\ndischarge was about 50 gallons per minute. In the garden of the\r\nHorticultural Society at Chiswick, the borings passed through 19 feet of\r\ngravel, 242-1/2 feet of clay and loam, and 67-1/2 feet of chalk, and the\r\nwater then rose to the surface from a depth of 329 feet.[305] At the\r\nDuke of Northumberland's, above Chiswick, the borings were carried to\r\nthe extraordinary depth of 620 feet, so as to enter the chalk, when a\r\nconsiderable volume of water was obtained, which rose four feet above\r\nthe surface of the ground. In a well of Mr. Brooks, at Hammersmith, the\r\nrush of water from a depth of 360 feet was so great, as to inundate\r\nseveral buildings and do considerable damage; and at Tooting, a\r\nsufficient stream was obtained to turn a wheel, and raise the water to\r\nthe upper stories of the houses.[306] In 1838, the total supply obtained\r\nfrom the chalk near London was estimated at six million gallons a day,\r\nand, in 1851, at nearly double that amount, the increase being\r\naccompanied by an average fall of no less than two feet a year in the\r\nlevel to which the water rose. The water stood commonly, in 1822, at\r\nhigh-water mark, and had sunk in 1851 to 45, and in some wells to 65\r\nfeet below high-water mark.[307] This fact shows the limited capacity of\r\nthe subterranean reservoir. In the last of three wells bored through the\r\nchalk at Tours, to the depth of several hundred feet, the water rose 32\r\nfeet above the level of the soil, and the discharge amounted to 300\r\ncubic yards of water every twenty-four hours.[308]\r\n\r\nBy way of experiment, the sinking of a well was commenced at Paris in\r\n1834, which had reached, in November, 1839, a depth of more than 1600\r\nEnglish feet, and yet no water ascended to the surface. The government\r\nwere persuaded by M. Arago to persevere, if necessary, to the depth of\r\nmore than 2000 feet; but when they had descended above 1800 English feet\r\nbelow the surface, the water rose through the tube (which was about ten\r\ninches in diameter), so as to discharge half a million of gallons of\r\nlimpid water every twenty-four hours. The temperature of the water\r\nincreased at the rate of 1.8 degrees F. for every 101 English feet, as\r\nthey went down, the result agreeing very closely with the anticipations\r\nof the scientific advisers of this most spirited undertaking.\r\n\r\nMr. Briggs, the British consul in Egypt, obtained water between Cairo\r\nand Suez, in a calcareous sand, at the depth of thirty feet; but it did\r\nnot rise in the well.[309] But other borings in the same desert, of\r\nvariable depth, between 50 and 300 feet, and which passed through\r\nalternations of sand, clay, and siliceous rock, yielded water at the\r\nsurface.[310]\r\n\r\nThe rise and overflow of the water in Artesian wells is generally\r\nreferred, and apparently with reason, to the same principle as the play\r\nof an artificial fountain. Let the porous stratum or set of strata, _a_\r\n_a_, rest on the impermeable rock _d_, and be covered by another mass of\r\nan impermeable nature. The whole mass _a_ _a_ may easily, in such a\r\nposition, become saturated with water, which may descend from its higher\r\nand exposed parts--a hilly region to which clouds are attracted, and\r\nwhere rain falls in abundance. Suppose that at some point, as at _b_, an\r\nopening be made, which gives a free passage upwards to the waters\r\nconfined in _a_ _a_, at so low a level that they are subjected to the\r\npressure of a considerable column of water collected in the more\r\nelevated portion of the same stratum. The water will then rush out, just\r\nas the liquid from a large barrel which is tapped, and it will rise to a\r\nheight corresponding to the level of its point of departure, or, rather,\r\nto a height which balances the pressure previously exerted by the\r\nconfined waters against the roof and sides of the stratum or reservoir\r\n_a_ _a_. In like manner, if there happen to be a natural fissure _c_, a\r\nspring will be produced at the surface on precisely the same principle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\nAmong the causes of the failure of Artesian wells, we may mention those\r\nnumerous rents and faults which abound in some rocks, and the deep\r\nravines and valleys by which many countries are traversed; for, when\r\nthese natural lines of drainage exist, there remains a small quantity\r\nonly of water to escape by artificial issues. We are also liable to be\r\nbaffled by the great thickness either of porous or impervious strata, or\r\nby the dip of the beds, which may carry off the waters from the\r\nadjoining high lands to some trough in an opposite direction, as when\r\nthe borings are made at the foot of an escarpment where the strata\r\nincline inwards, or in a direction opposite to the face of the cliffs.\r\n\r\nThe mere distance of hills or mountains need not discourage us from\r\nmaking trials; for the waters which fall on these higher lands readily\r\npenetrate to great depths through highly inclined or vertical strata, or\r\nthrough the fissures of shattered rocks, and after flowing for a great\r\ndistance, must often reascend and be brought up again by other fissures,\r\nso as to approach the surface in the lower country. Here they may be\r\nconcealed beneath the covering of undisturbed horizontal beds, which it\r\nmay be necessary to pierce in order to reach them. It should be\r\nremembered, that the course of waters flowing under ground bears but a\r\nremote resemblance to that of rivers on the surface, there being, in the\r\none case, a constant descent from a higher to a lower level from the\r\nsource of the stream to the sea; whereas, in the other, the water may at\r\none time sink far below the level of the ocean, and afterwards rise\r\nagain high above it.\r\n\r\nAmong other curious facts ascertained by aid of the borer, it is proved\r\nthat in strata of different ages and compositions, there are often open\r\npassages by which the subterranean waters circulate. Thus, at St. Ouen,\r\nin France, five distinct sheets of water were intersected in a well, and\r\nfrom each of these a supply obtained. In the third waterbearing stratum,\r\nat the depth of 150 feet, a cavity was found in which the borer fell\r\nsuddenly about a foot, and thence the water ascended in great\r\nvolume.[311] The same falling of the instrument, as in a hollow space,\r\nhas been remarked in England and other countries. At Tours, in 1830, a\r\nwell was perforated quite through the chalk, when the water suddenly\r\nbrought up, from a depth of 364 feet, a great quantity of fine sand,\r\nwith much vegetable matter and shells. Branches of a thorn several\r\ninches long, much blackened by their stay in the water, were recognized,\r\nas also the stems of marsh plants, and some of their roots, which were\r\nstill white, together with the seeds of the same in a state of\r\npreservation, which showed that they had not remained more than three or\r\nfour months in the water. Among the seeds were those of the marsh plant\r\n_Galium uliginosum_; and among the shells, a freshwater species\r\n(_Planorbis marginatus_), and some land species, as _Helix rotundata_,\r\nand _H. striata_. M. Dujardin, who, with others, observed this\r\nphenomenon, supposes that the waters had flowed from some valleys of\r\nAuvergne or the Vivarais since the preceding autumn.[312]\r\n\r\nAn analogous phenomenon is recorded at Reimke, near Bochum in\r\nWestphalia, where the water of an Artesian well brought up, from a\r\ndepth of 156 feet, several small fish, three or four inches long, the\r\nnearest streams in the country being at a distance of some leagues.[313]\r\n\r\nIn both cases it is evident that water had penetrated to great depths,\r\nnot simply by filtering through a porous mass, for then it would have\r\nleft behind the shells, fish, and fragments of plants, but by flowing\r\nthrough some open channels in the earth. Such examples may suggest the\r\nidea that the leaky beds of rivers are often the feeders of springs.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERAL AND THERMAL SPRINGS.\r\n\r\nAlmost all springs, even those which we consider the purest, are\r\nimpregnated with some foreign ingredients, which, being in a state of\r\nchemical solution, are so intimately blended with the water as not to\r\naffect its clearness, while they render it, in general, more agreeable\r\nto our taste, and more nutritious than simple rain-water. But the\r\nsprings called mineral contain an unusual abundance of earthy matter in\r\nsolution, and the substances with which they are impregnated correspond\r\nremarkably with those evolved in a gaseous form by volcanoes. Many of\r\nthese springs are thermal, _i. e._, their temperature is above the mean\r\ntemperature of the place, and they rise up through all kinds of rock;\r\nas, for example, through granite, gneiss, limestone, or lava, but are\r\nmost frequent in volcanic regions, or where violent earthquakes have\r\noccurred at eras comparatively modern.\r\n\r\nThe water given out by hot springs is generally more voluminous and less\r\nvariable in quantity at different seasons than that proceeding from any\r\nothers. In many volcanic regions, jets of steam, called by the Italians\r\n\"stufas,\" issue from fissures, at a temperature high above the boiling\r\npoint, as in the neighborhood of Naples, and in the Lipari Isles, and\r\nare disengaged unceasingly for ages. Now, if such columns of steam,\r\nwhich are often mixed with other gases, should be condensed before\r\nreaching the surface by coming in contact with strata filled with cold\r\nwater, they may give rise to thermal and mineral springs of every degree\r\nof temperature. It is, indeed, by this means only, and not by\r\nhydrostatic pressure, that we can account for the rise of such bodies of\r\nwater from great depths; nor can we hesitate to admit the adequacy of\r\nthe cause, if we suppose the expansion of the same elastic fluids to be\r\nsufficient to raise columns of lava to the lofty summits of volcanic\r\nmountains. Several gases, the carbonic acid in particular, are\r\ndisengaged in a free state from the soil in many districts, especially\r\nin the regions of active or extinct volcanoes; and the same are found\r\nmore or less intimately combined with the waters of all mineral springs,\r\nboth cold and thermal. Dr. Daubeny and other writers have remarked, not\r\nonly that these springs are most abundant in volcanic regions, but that\r\nwhen remote from them, their site usually coincides with the position of\r\nsome great derangement in the strata; a fault, for example, or great\r\nfissure, indicating that a channel of communication has been opened with\r\nthe interior of the earth at some former period of local convulsion. It\r\nis also ascertained that at great heights in the Pyrenees and Himalaya\r\nmountains hot springs burst out from granitic rocks, and they are\r\nabundant in the Alps also, these chains having all been disturbed and\r\ndislocated at times comparatively modern, as can be shown by independent\r\ngeological evidence.\r\n\r\nThe small area of volcanic regions may appear, at first view, to present\r\nan objection to these views, but not so when we include earthquakes\r\namong the effects of igneous agency. A large proportion of the land\r\nhitherto explored by geologists can be shown to have been rent or shaken\r\nby subterranean movements since the oldest tertiary strata were formed.\r\nIt will also be seen, in the sequel, that new springs have burst out,\r\nand others have had the volume of their waters augmented, and their\r\ntemperature suddenly raised after earthquakes, so that the description\r\nof these springs might almost with equal propriety have been given under\r\nthe head of \"igneous causes,\" as they are agents of a mixed nature,\r\nbeing at once igneous and aqueous.\r\n\r\nBut how, it will be asked, can the regions of volcanic heat send forth\r\nsuch inexhaustible supplies of water? The difficulty of solving this\r\nproblem would, in truth, be insurmountable, if we believed that all the\r\natmospheric waters found their way into the basin of the ocean; but in\r\nboring near the shore we often meet with streams of fresh water at the\r\ndepth of several hundred feet below the sea level; and these probably\r\ndescend, in many cases, far beneath the bottom of the sea, when not\r\nartificially intercepted in their course. Yet, how much greater may be\r\nthe quantity of salt water which sinks beneath the floor of the ocean,\r\nthrough the porous strata of which it is often composed, or through\r\nfissures rent in it by earthquakes. After penetrating to a considerable\r\ndepth, this water may encounter a heat of sufficient intensity to\r\nconvert it into vapor, even under the high pressure to which it would\r\nthen be subjected. This heat would probably be nearest the surface in\r\nvolcanic countries, and farthest from it in those districts which have\r\nbeen longest free from eruptions or earthquakes.\r\n\r\nIt would follow from the views above explained, that there must be a\r\ntwofold circulation of terrestrial waters; one caused by solar heat, and\r\nthe other by heat generated in the interior of our planet. We know that\r\nthe land would be unfit for vegetation, if deprived of the waters raised\r\ninto the atmosphere by the sun; but it is also true that mineral springs\r\nare powerful instruments in rendering the surface subservient to the\r\nsupport of animal and vegetable life. Their heat is said to promote the\r\ndevelopment of the aquatic tribes in many parts of the ocean, and the\r\nsubstances which they carry up from the bowels of the earth to the\r\nhabitable surface, are of a nature and in a form which adapts them\r\npeculiarly for the nutrition of animals and plants.\r\n\r\nAs these springs derive their chief importance to the geologist from\r\nthe quantity and quality of the earthy materials which, like volcanoes,\r\nthey convey from below upwards, they may properly be considered in\r\nreference to the ingredients which they hold in solution. These consist\r\nof a great variety of substances; but chiefly salts with bases of lime,\r\nmagnesia, alumine, and iron, combined with carbonic, sulphuric, and\r\nmuriatic acids. Muriate of soda, silica, and free carbonic acid are\r\nfrequently present; also springs of petroleum, or liquid bitumen, and of\r\nnaphtha.\r\n\r\n_Calcareous springs._--Our first attention is naturally directed to\r\nsprings which are highly charged with calcareous matter, for these\r\nproduce a variety of phenomena of much interest in geology. It is known\r\nthat rain-water collecting carbonic acid from the atmosphere has the\r\nproperty of dissolving the calcareous rocks over which it flows, and\r\nthus, in the smallest ponds and rivulets, matter is often supplied for\r\nthe earthy secretions of testacea, and for the growth of certain plants\r\non which they feed. But many springs hold so much carbonic acid in\r\nsolution, that they are enabled to dissolve a much larger quantity of\r\ncalcareous matter than rain-water; and when the acid is dissipated in\r\nthe atmosphere, the mineral ingredients are thrown down, in the form of\r\nporous tufa or of more compact travertin.[314]\r\n\r\n_Auvergne._--Calcareous springs, although most abundant in limestone\r\ndistricts, are by no means confined to them, but flow out\r\nindiscriminately from all rock formations. In central France, a district\r\nwhere the primary rocks are unusually destitute of limestone, springs\r\ncopiously charged with carbonate of lime rise up through the granite and\r\ngneiss. Some of these are thermal, and probably derive their origin from\r\nthe deep source of volcanic heat, once so active in that region. One of\r\nthese springs, at the northern base of the hill upon which Claremont is\r\nbuilt, issues from volcanic peperino, which rests on granite. It has\r\nformed, by its incrustations, an elevated mound of travertin, or white\r\nconcretionary limestone, 240 feet in length, and, at its termination,\r\nsixteen feet high and twelve wide. Another encrusting spring in the same\r\ndepartment, situated at Chaluzet, near Pont Gibaud, rises in a gneiss\r\ncountry, at the foot of a regular volcanic cone, at least twenty miles\r\nfrom any calcareous rock. Some masses of tufaceous deposit, produced by\r\nthis spring, have an oolitic texture.\r\n\r\n_Valley of the Elsa._--If we pass from the volcanic district of France\r\nto that which skirts the Apennines in the Italian peninsula, we meet\r\nwith innumerable springs which have precipitated so much calcareous\r\nmatter, that the whole ground in some parts of Tuscany is coated over\r\nwith tufa and travertin, and sounds hollow beneath the foot.\r\n\r\nIn other places in the same country, compact rocks are seen descending\r\nthe slanting sides of hills, very much in the manner of lava currents,\r\nexcept that they are of a white color and terminate abruptly when they\r\nreach the course of a river. These consist of a calcareous precipitate\r\nfrom springs, some of which are still flowing, while others have\r\ndisappeared or changed their position. Such masses are frequent on the\r\nslope of the hills which bound the valley of the Elsa, one of the\r\ntributaries of the Arno, which flows near Colle, through a valley\r\nseveral hundred feet deep, shaped out of a lacustrine formation,\r\ncontaining fossil shells of existing species. I observed here that the\r\ntravertin was unconformable to the lacustrine beds, its inclination\r\naccording with the slope of the sides of the valley. One of the finest\r\nexamples which I saw was at the Molino delle Caldane, near Colle. The\r\nSena, and several other small rivulets which feed the Elsa, have the\r\nproperty of encrusting wood and herbs with calcareous stone. In the bed\r\nof the Elsa itself, aquatic plants, such as Charae, which absorb large\r\nquantities of carbonate of lime, are very abundant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.\r\n\r\nSection of travertin, San Vignone.]\r\n\r\n_Baths of San Vignone._--Those persons who have merely seen the action\r\nof petrifying waters in England, will not easily form an adequate\r\nconception of the scale on which the same process is exhibited in those\r\nregions which lie nearer to the active centres of volcanic disturbance.\r\nOne of the most striking examples of the rapid precipitation of\r\ncarbonate of lime from thermal waters, occurs in the hill of San Vignone\r\nin Tuscany, at a short distance from Radicofani, and only a few hundred\r\nyards from the high road between Sienna and Rome. The spring issues from\r\nnear the summit of a rocky hill, about 100 feet in height. The top of\r\nthe hill stretches in a gently inclined platform to the foot of Mount\r\nAmiata, a lofty eminence, which consists in great part of volcanic\r\nproducts. The fundamental rock, from which the spring issues, is a black\r\nslate, with serpentine (_b_ _b_, fig. 21), belonging to the older\r\nApennine formation. The water is hot, has a strong taste, and, when not\r\nin very small quantity, is of a bright green color. So rapid is the\r\ndeposition near the source, that in the bottom of a conduit-pipe for\r\ncarrying off the water to the baths, and which is inclined at an angle\r\nof 30 degrees, half a foot of solid travertin is formed every year. A more\r\ncompact rock is produced where the water flows slowly; and the\r\nprecipitation in winter, when there is least evaporation, is said to be\r\nmore solid, but less in quantity by one-fourth, than in summer. The rock\r\nis generally white; some parts of it are compact, and ring to the\r\nhammer; others are cellular, and with such cavities as are seen in the\r\ncarious part of bone or the siliceous millstone of the Paris basin. A\r\nportion of it also below the village of San Vignone consists of\r\nincrustations of long vegetable tubes, and may be called tufa. Sometimes\r\nthe travertin assumes precisely the botryoidal and mammillary forms,\r\ncommon to similar deposits in Auvergne, of a much older date; and, like\r\nthem, it often scales off in thin, slightly undulating layers.\r\n\r\nA large mass of travertin (_c_, fig. 21) descends the hill from the\r\npoint where the spring issues, and reaches to the distance of about half\r\na mile east of San Vignone. The beds take the slope of the hill at about\r\nan angle of 6 degrees, and the planes of stratification are perfectly\r\nparallel. One stratum, composed of many layers, is of a compact nature,\r\nand fifteen feet thick; it serves as an excellent building stone, and a\r\nmass of fifteen feet in length was, in 1828, cut out for the new bridge\r\nover the Orcia. Another branch of it (_a_, fig. 21) descends to the\r\nwest, for 250 feet in length, of varying thickness, but sometimes 200\r\nfeet deep; it is then cut off by the small river Orcia, as some glaciers\r\nin Switzerland descend into a valley till their progress is suddenly\r\narrested by a transverse stream of water.\r\n\r\nThe abrupt termination of the mass of rock at the river, where its\r\nthickness is undiminished, clearly shows that it would proceed much\r\nfarther if not arrested by the stream, over which it impends slightly.\r\nBut it cannot encroach upon the channel of the Orcia, being constantly\r\nundermined, so that its solid fragments are seen strewed amongst the\r\nalluvial gravel. However enormous, therefore, the mass of solid rock may\r\nappear which has been given out by this single spring, we may feel\r\nassured that it is insignificant in volume when compared to that which\r\nhas been carried to the sea since the time when it began to flow. What\r\nmay have been the length of that period of time we have no data for\r\nconjecturing. In quarrying the travertin, Roman tiles have been\r\nsometimes found at the depth of five or six feet.\r\n\r\n_Baths of San Filippo._--On another hill, not many miles from that last\r\nmentioned, and also connected with Mount Amiata, the summit of which is\r\nabout three miles distant, are the celebrated baths of San Filippo. The\r\nsubjacent rocks consist of alternations of black slate, limestone, and\r\nserpentine. There are three warm springs containing carbonate and\r\nsulphate of lime, and sulphate of magnesia. The water which supplies the\r\nbaths falls into a pond, where it has been known to deposit a solid mass\r\n_thirty feet thick_ in about _twenty years_.[315] A manufactory of\r\nmedallions in basso-relievo is carried on at these baths. The water is\r\nconducted by canals into several pits, in which it deposits travertin\r\nand crystals of sulphate of lime. After being thus freed from its\r\ngrosser parts, it is conveyed by a tube to the summit of a small\r\nchamber, and made to fall through a space of ten or twelve feet. The\r\ncurrent is broken in its descent by numerous crossed sticks, by which\r\nthe spray is dispersed around upon certain moulds, which are rubbed\r\nlightly over with a solution of soap, and a deposition of solid matter\r\nlike marble is the result, yielding a beautiful cast of the figures\r\nformed in the mould. The geologist may derive from these experiments\r\nconsiderable light, in regard to the high slope of the strata at which\r\nsome semi-crystalline precipitations can be formed; for some of the\r\nmoulds are disposed almost perpendicularly, yet the deposition is nearly\r\nequal in all parts.\r\n\r\nA hard stratum of stone, about a foot in thickness, is obtained from the\r\nwaters of San Filippo in four months; and, as the springs are powerful,\r\nand almost uniform in the quantity given out, we are at no loss to\r\ncomprehend the magnitude of the mass which descends the hill, which is a\r\nmile and a quarter in length and the third of a mile in breadth, in some\r\nplaces attaining a thickness of 250 feet at least. To what length it\r\nmight have reached it is impossible to conjecture, as it is cut off,\r\nlike the travertin of San Vignone, by a small stream, where it\r\nterminates abruptly. The remainder of the matter held in solution is\r\ncarried on probably to the sea.\r\n\r\n_Spheroidal structure in travertin._--But what renders this recent\r\nlimestone of peculiar interest to the geologist, is the spheroidal form\r\nwhich it assumes, analogous to that of the cascade of Tivoli, afterwards\r\nto be described. (See fig. 22, p. 244.) The lamination of some of the\r\nconcentric masses is so minute that sixty may be counted in the\r\nthickness of an inch, yet, notwithstanding these marks of gradual and\r\nsuccessive deposition, sections are sometimes exhibited of what might\r\nseem to be perfect spheres. This tendency to a mammillary and globular\r\nstructure arises from the facility with which the calcareous matter is\r\nprecipitated in nearly equal quantities on all sides of any fragment of\r\nshell or wood or any inequality of the surface over which the mineral\r\nwater flows, the form of the nucleus being readily transmitted through\r\nany number of successive envelopes. But these masses can never be\r\nperfect spheres, although they often appear such when a transverse\r\nsection is made in any line not in the direction of the point of\r\nattachment. There are, indeed, occasionally seen small oolitic and\r\npisolitic grains, of which the form is globular; for the nucleus, having\r\nbeen for a time in motion in the water, has received fresh accessions of\r\nmatter on all sides.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner I have seen, on the vertical walls of large\r\nsteam-boilers, the heads of nails or rivets covered by a series of\r\nenveloping crusts of calcareous matter, usually sulphate of lime; so\r\nthat a concretionary nodule is formed, preserving a nearly globular\r\nshape, when increased to a mass several inches in diameter. In these, as\r\nin many travertins, there is often a combination of the concentric and\r\nradiated structure.\r\n\r\n_Campagna di Roma._--The country around Rome, like many parts of the\r\nTuscan States already referred to, has been at some former period the\r\nsite of numerous volcanic eruptions; and the springs are still copiously\r\nimpregnated with lime, carbonic acid, and sulphuretted hydrogen. A hot\r\nspring was discovered about 1827, near Civita Vecchia, by Signor\r\nRiccioli, which deposits alternate beds of a yellowish travertin, and a\r\nwhite granular rock, not distinguishable, in hand specimens, either in\r\ngrain, color, or composition, from statuary marble. There is a passage\r\nbetween this and ordinary travertin. The mass accumulated near the\r\nspring is in some places about six feet thick.\r\n\r\n_Lake of the Solfatara._--In the Campagna, between Rome and Tivoli, is\r\nthe Lake of the Solfatara, called also Lago di Zolfo (lacus albula),\r\ninto which flows continually a stream of tepid water from a smaller\r\nlake, situated a few yards above it. The water is a saturated solution\r\nof carbonic acid gas, which escapes from it in such quantities in some\r\nparts of its surface, that it has the appearance of being actually in\r\nebullition. \"I have found by experiment,\" says Sir Humphry Davy, \"that\r\nthe water taken from the most tranquil part of the lake, even after\r\nbeing agitated and exposed to the air, contained in solution more than\r\nits own volume of carbonic acid gas, with a very small quantity of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen. Its high temperature, which is pretty constant at\r\n80 degrees of Fahr., and the quantity of carbonic acid that it contains,\r\nrender it peculiarly fitted to afford nourishment to vegetable life. The\r\nbanks of travertin are everywhere covered with reeds, lichen, confervae,\r\nand various kinds of aquatic vegetables; and at the same time that the\r\nprocess of vegetable life is going on, the crystallizations of the\r\ncalcareous matter, which is everywhere deposited, in consequence of the\r\nescape of carbonic acid, likewise proceed. There is, I believe, no place\r\nin the world where there is a more striking example of the opposition or\r\ncontrast of the laws of animate and inanimate nature, of the forces of\r\ninorganic chemical affinity, and those of the powers of life.\"[316]\r\n\r\nThe same observer informs us that he fixed a stick in a mass of\r\ntravertin covered by the water in the month of May, and in April\r\nfollowing he had some difficulty in breaking, with a sharp-pointed\r\nhammer, the mass which adhered to the stick, and which was several\r\ninches in thickness. The upper part was a mixture of light tufa and the\r\nleaves of confervae; below this was a darker and more solid travertin,\r\ncontaining black and decomposed masses of confervae; in the inferior part\r\nthe travertin was more solid, and of a gray color, but with cavities\r\nprobably produced by the decomposition of vegetable matter.[317]\r\n\r\nThe stream which flows out of this lake fills a canal about nine feet\r\nbroad and four deep, and is conspicuous in the landscape by a line of\r\nvapor which rises from it. It deposits calcareous tufa in this channel,\r\nand the Tiber probably receives from it, as well as from numerous other\r\nstreams, much carbonate of lime in solution, which may contribute to the\r\nrapid growth of its delta. A large proportion of the most splendid\r\nedifices of ancient and modern Rome are built of travertin, derived from\r\nthe quarries of Ponte Lucano, where there has evidently been a lake at a\r\nremote period, on the same plain as that already described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.\r\n\r\nSection of spheroidal concretionary Travertin under the Cascade of\r\nTivoli.]\r\n\r\n_Travertin of Tivoli._--In the same neighborhood the calcareous waters\r\nof the Anio incrust the reeds which grow on its banks, and the foam of\r\nthe cataract of Tivoli forms beautiful pendant stalactites. On the sides\r\nof the deep chasm into which the cascade throws itself, there is seen an\r\nextraordinary accumulation of horizontal beds of tufa and travertin,\r\nfrom four to five hundred feet in thickness. The section immediately\r\nunder the temples of Vesta and the Sibyl, displays, in a precipice about\r\nfour hundred feet high, some spheroids which are from _six to eight feet\r\nin diameter_, each concentric layer being about the eighth of an inch in\r\nthickness. The preceding diagram exhibits about fourteen feet of this\r\nimmense mass, as seen in the path cut out of the rock in descending from\r\nthe temple of Vesta to the Grotto di Nettuno. I have not attempted to\r\nexpress in this drawing the innumerable thin layers of which these\r\nmagnificent spheroids are composed, but the lines given mark some of the\r\nnatural divisions into which they are separated by minute variations in\r\nthe size or color of the laminae. The undulations also are much smaller\r\nin proportion to the whole circumference than in the drawing. The beds\r\n(_a_ _a_) are of hard travertin and soft tufa; below them is a pisolite\r\n(_b_), the globules being of different sizes: underneath this appears a\r\nmass of concretionary travertin (_c_ _c_), some of the spheroids being\r\nof the above-mentioned extraordinary size. In some places (as at _d_)\r\nthere is a mass of amorphous limestone, or tufa, surrounded by\r\nconcentric layers. At the bottom is another bed of pisolite (_b_), in\r\nwhich the small nodules are about the size and shape of beans, and some\r\nof them of filberts, intermixed with some smaller oolitic grains. In the\r\ntufaceous strata, wood is seen converted into a light tufa.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the whole of this deposit was formed in\r\nan extensive lake which existed when the external configuration of this\r\ncountry varied greatly from that now observed. The Anio throws itself\r\ninto a ravine excavated in the ancient travertin, and its waters give\r\nrise to masses of calcareous stone, scarcely if at all distinguishable\r\nfrom the older rock. I was shown, in 1828, in the upper part of the\r\ntravertin, the hollow left by a cart-wheel, in which the outer circle\r\nand the spokes had been decomposed, and the spaces which they filled\r\nleft void. It seemed to me at the time impossible to explain the\r\nposition of this mould without supposing that the wheel was imbedded\r\nbefore the lake was drained; but Sir R. Murchison suggests that it may\r\nhave been washed down by a flood into the gorge in modern times, and\r\nthen incrusted with calcareous tufa in the same manner as the wooden\r\nbeam of the church of St. Lucia was swept down in 1826, and stuck fast\r\nin the Grotto of the Syren, where it still remains, and will eventually\r\nbe quite imbedded in travertin.\r\n\r\nI have already endeavored to explain (p. 241), when speaking of the\r\ntravertin of San Filippo, how the spheroidal masses represented in\r\nfigure 22 may have been formed.\r\n\r\n_Sulphureous and gypseus springs._--The quantity of other mineral\r\ningredients wherewith springs in general are impregnated, is\r\ninsignificant in comparison to lime, and this earth is most frequently\r\ncombined with carbonic acid. But as sulphuric acid, and sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen are very frequently supplied by springs, gypsum may, perhaps,\r\nbe deposited largely in certain seas and lakes. Among other gypseous\r\nprecipitates at present known on the land, I may mention those of Baden,\r\nnear Vienna, which feed the public bath. Some of these supply singly\r\nfrom 600 to 1000 cubic feet of water per hour, and deposit a fine\r\npowder, composed of a mixture of sulphate of lime with sulphur and\r\nmuriate of lime.[318] The thermal waters of Aix, in Savoy, in passing\r\nthrough strata of Jurassic limestone, turn them into gypsum or sulphate\r\nof lime. In the Andes, at the Puenta del Inca, Lieutenant Brand found a\r\nthermal spring at the temperature of 91 degrees Fahr., containing a large\r\nproportion of gypsum with carbonate of lime and other ingredients.[319]\r\nMany of the mineral springs of Iceland, says Mr. R. Bunsen, deposit\r\ngypsum.[320] and sulphureous acid gas escapes plentifully from them as\r\nfrom the volcanoes of the same island. It may, indeed, be laid down as a\r\ngeneral rule, that the mineral substances dissolved in hot springs agree\r\nvery closely with those which are disengaged in a gaseous form from the\r\ncraters of active volcanoes.\r\n\r\n_Siliceous springs.--Azores._--In order that water should hold a very\r\nlarge quantity of silica in solution, it seems necessary that it should\r\nbe raised to a high temperature.[321] The hot springs of the Valle das\r\nFernas, in the island of St. Michael, rising through volcanic rocks,\r\nprecipitate vast quantities of siliceous sinter. Around the circular\r\nbasin of the largest spring, which is between twenty and thirty feet in\r\ndiameter, alternate layers are seen of a coarser variety of sinter mixed\r\nwith clay, including grass, ferns, and reeds, in different states of\r\npetrifaction. In some instances, alumina, which is likewise deposited\r\nfrom the hot waters, is the mineralizing material. Branches of the same\r\nferns which now flourish in the island are found completely petrified,\r\npreserving the same appearance as when vegetating, except that they\r\nacquire an ash-gray color. Fragments of wood, and one entire bed from\r\nthree to five feet in depth, composed of reeds now common in the island,\r\nhave become completely mineralized.\r\n\r\nThe most abundant variety of siliceous sinter occurs in layers, from a\r\nquarter to half an inch in thickness, accumulated on each other often to\r\nthe height of a foot and upwards, and constituting parallel, and for the\r\nmost part horizontal, strata many yards in extent. This sinter has often\r\na beautiful semi-opalescent lustre. A recent breccia is also in the act\r\nof forming, composed of obsidian, pumice, and scoriae, cemented by\r\nsiliceous sinter.[322]\r\n\r\n_Geysers of Iceland._--But the hot springs in various parts of Iceland,\r\nparticularly the celebrated geysers, afford the most remarkable example\r\nof the deposition of silex.[323] The circular reservoirs into which the\r\ngeysers fall, are lined in the interior with a variety of opal, and\r\nround the edges with sinter. The plants incrusted with the latter\r\nsubstance have much the same appearance as those incrusted with\r\ncalcareous tufa in our own country. They consist of various grasses, the\r\nhorse-tail (_Equisetum_), and leaves of the birch-tree, which are the\r\nmost common of all, though no trees of this species now exist in the\r\nsurrounding country. The petrified stems also of the birch occur in a\r\nstate much resembling agatized wood.[324]\r\n\r\nBy analysis of the water, Mr. Faraday has ascertained that the solution\r\nof the silex is promoted by the presence of the alkali, soda. He\r\nsuggests that the deposition of silica in an insoluble state takes place\r\npartly because the water when cooled by exposure to the air is unable\r\nto retain as much silica as when it issues from the earth at a\r\ntemperature of 180 degrees or 190 degrees Fahr.; and partly because the\r\nevaporation of the water decomposes the compound of silica and soda\r\nwhich previously existed. This last change is probably hastened by the\r\ncarbonic acid of the atmosphere uniting with the soda. The alkali, when\r\ndisunited from the silica, would readily be dissolved in and removed by\r\nrunning water.[325]\r\n\r\nMineral waters, even when charged with a small proportion of silica, as\r\nthose of Ischia, may supply certain species of corals, sponges, and\r\ninfusoria, with matter for their siliceous secretions; but there is\r\nlittle doubt that rivers obtain silex in solution from another and far\r\nmore general source, namely, the decomposition of felspar. When this\r\nmineral, which is so abundant an ingredient in the hypogene and trappean\r\nrocks, has disintegrated, it is found that the residue, called porcelain\r\nclay, contains a small proportion only of the silica which existed in\r\nthe original felspar, the other part having been dissolved and removed\r\nby water.[326]\r\n\r\n_Ferruginous springs._--The waters of almost all springs contain some\r\niron in solution; and it is a fact familiar to all, that many of them\r\nare so copiously impregnated with this metal, as to stain the rocks or\r\nherbage through which they pass, and to bind together sand and gravel\r\ninto solid masses. We may naturally, then, conclude that this iron,\r\nwhich is constantly conveyed from the interior of the earth into lakes\r\nand seas, and which does not escape again from them into the atmosphere\r\nby evaporation, must act as a coloring and cementing principle in the\r\nsubaqueous deposits now in progress. Geologists are aware that many\r\nancient sandstones and conglomerates are bound together or colored by\r\niron.\r\n\r\n_Brine springs._--So great is the quantity of muriate of soda in some\r\nsprings, that they yield one-fourth of their weight in salt. They are\r\nrarely, however, so saturated, and generally contain, intermixed with\r\nsalt, carbonate and sulphate of lime, magnesia, and other mineral\r\ningredients. The brine springs of Cheshire are the richest in our\r\ncountry; those of Northwich being almost saturated. Those of Barton\r\nalso, in Lancashire, and Droitwich in Worcestershire, are extremely\r\nrich.[327] They are known to have flowed for more than 1000 years, and\r\nthe quantity of salt which they have carried into the Severn and Mersey\r\nmust be enormous. These brine springs rise up through strata of\r\nsandstone and red marl, which contain large beds of rock salt. The\r\norigin of the brine, therefore, may be derived in this and many other\r\ninstances from beds of fossil salt; but as muriate of soda is one of the\r\nproducts of volcanic emanations and of springs in volcanic regions, the\r\noriginal source of salt may be as deep seated as that of lava.\r\n\r\nMany springs in Sicily contain muriate of soda, and the \"fiume salso,\"\r\nin particular, is impregnated with so large a quantity, that cattle\r\nrefuse to drink of it. A hot spring, rising through granite, at Saint\r\nNectaire, in Auvergne, may be mentioned as one of many, containing a\r\nlarge proportion of muriate of soda, together with magnesia and other\r\ningredients.[328]\r\n\r\n_Carbonated springs.--Auvergne._--Carbonic acid gas is very plentifully\r\ndisengaged from springs in almost all countries, but particularly near\r\nactive or extinct volcanoes. This elastic fluid has the property of\r\ndecomposing many of the hardest rocks with which it comes in contact,\r\nparticularly that numerous class in whose composition felspar is an\r\ningredient. It renders the oxide of iron soluble in water, and\r\ncontributes, as was before stated, to the solution of calcareous matter.\r\nIn volcanic districts these gaseous emanations are not confined to\r\nsprings, but rise up in the state of pure gas from the soil in various\r\nplaces. The Grotto del Cane, near Naples, affords an example, and\r\nprodigious quantities are now annually disengaged from every part of the\r\nLimagne d'Auvergne, where it appears to have been developed in equal\r\nquantity from time immemorial. As the acid is invisible, it is not\r\nobserved, except an excavation be made, wherein it immediately\r\naccumulates, so that it will extinguish a candle. There are some springs\r\nin this district, where the water is seen bubbling and boiling up with\r\nmuch noise, in consequence of the abundant disengagement of this gas. In\r\nthe environs of Pont-Gibaud, not far from Clermont, a rock belonging to\r\nthe gneiss formation, in which lead-mines are worked, has been found to\r\nbe quite saturated with carbonic acid gas, which is constantly\r\ndisengaged. The carbonates of iron, lime, and manganese are so\r\ndissolved, that the rock is rendered soft, and the quartz alone remains\r\nunattacked.[329] Not far off is the small volcanic cone of Chaluzet,\r\nwhich once broke up through the gneiss, and sent forth a lava stream.\r\n\r\n_Supposed atmosphere of carbonic acid._--Prof. Bischoff in his history\r\nof volcanoes,[330] has shown what enormous quantities of carbonic acid\r\ngas are exhaled in the vicinity of the extinct craters of the Rhine (in\r\nthe neighborhood of the Laacher-see, for example, and the Eifel), and\r\nalso in the mineral springs of Nassau and other countries, where there\r\nare no immediate traces of volcanic action. It would be easy to\r\ncalculate in how short a period the solid carbon, thus emitted from the\r\ninterior of the earth in an invisible form, would amount to a quantity\r\nas great as could be obtained from the trees of a large forest, and how\r\nmany thousand years would be required to supply the materials of a dense\r\nseam of pure coal from the same source. Geologists who favor the\r\ndoctrine of the former existence of an atmosphere highly charged with\r\ncarbonic acid, at the period of the ancient coal-plants, have not\r\nsufficiently reflected on the continual disengagement of carbon, which\r\nis taking place in a gaseous form from springs, as also in a free state\r\nfrom the ground and from volcanic craters into the air. We know that\r\nall plants are now engaged in secreting carbon, and many thousands of\r\nlarge trees are annually floated down by great rivers, and buried in\r\ntheir alluvial deposits; but before we can assume that the quantity of\r\ncarbon which becomes permanently locked up in the earth by such agency\r\nwill bring about an essential change in the chemical composition of the\r\natmosphere, we must be sure that the trees annually buried contain more\r\ncarbon than is given out from the interior of the earth in the same\r\nlapse of time. Every large area covered by a dense mass of peat, bears\r\nample testimony to the fact, that several million tons of carbon have\r\nbeen taken from the air, by the powers of vegetable life, and stored up\r\nin the earth's crust, a large quantity of oxygen having been at the same\r\ntime set free; but we cannot infer from these circumstances, that the\r\nconstitution of the atmosphere has been materially deranged, until we\r\nhave data for estimating the rate at which dead animal and vegetable\r\nsubstances are daily putrefying,--organic remains and various calcareous\r\nrocks decomposing, and volcanic regions emitting fresh volumes of\r\ncarbonic acid gas. That the ancient carboniferous period was one of vast\r\nduration all geologists are agreed; instead, therefore, of supposing an\r\nexcess of carbonic acid in the air at that epoch, for the support of a\r\npeculiar flora, we may imagine Time to have multiplied the quantity of\r\ncarbon given out annually by mineral springs, volcanic craters, and\r\nother sources, until the component elements of any given number of\r\ncoal-seams had been evolved from below, without any variation taking\r\nplace in the constitution of the atmosphere. It has been too common, in\r\nreasoning on this question, to compute the loss of carbon by the volume\r\nof coal stored up in the ancient strata, and to take no account of the\r\nannual gain, by the restoration of carbonic acid to the atmosphere,\r\nthrough the machinery above alluded to.[331]\r\n\r\n_Disintegrating effects of carbonic acid._--The disintegration of\r\ngranite is a striking feature of large districts in Auvergne, especially\r\nin the neighborhood of Clermont. This decay was called by Dolomieu, \"la\r\nmaladie du granite;\" and the rock may with propriety be said to have\r\n_the rot_, for it crumbles to pieces in the hand. The phenomenon may,\r\nwithout doubt, be ascribed to the continual disengagement of carbonic\r\nacid gas from numerous fissures.\r\n\r\nIn the plains of the Po, between Verona and Parma, especially at Villa\r\nFranca, south of Mantua, I observed great beds of alluvium, consisting\r\nchiefly of primary pebbles, percolated by spring-water, charged with\r\ncarbonate of lime and carbonic acid in great abundance. They are for the\r\nmost part incrusted with calc-sinter; and the rounded blocks of gneiss,\r\nwhich have all the outward appearance of solidity, have been so\r\ndisintegrated by the carbonic acid as readily to fall to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe subtraction of many of the elements of rocks by the solvent power of\r\ncarbonic acid, ascending both in a gaseous state and mixed with\r\nspring-water in the crevices of rocks, must be one of the most powerful\r\nsources of those internal changes and rearrangements of particles so\r\noften observed in strata of every age. The calcareous matter, for\r\nexample, of shells, is often entirely removed and replaced by carbonate\r\nof iron, pyrites, silex, or some other ingredient, such as mineral\r\nwaters usually contain in solution. It rarely happens, except in\r\nlimestone rocks, that the carbonic acid can dissolve all the constituent\r\nparts of the mass; and for this reason, probably, calcareous rocks are\r\nalmost the only ones in which great caverns and long winding passages\r\nare found.\r\n\r\n_Petroleum springs._--Springs of which the waters contain a mixture of\r\npetroleum and the various minerals allied to it, as bitumen, naphtha,\r\nasphaltum, and pitch, are very numerous, and are, in many cases,\r\nundoubtedly connected with subterranean fires, which raise or sublime\r\nthe more subtle parts of the bituminous matters contained in rocks. Many\r\nsprings in the territory of Modena and Parma, in Italy, produce\r\npetroleum in abundance; but the most powerful, perhaps, yet known, are\r\nthose on the Irawadi, in the Burman empire. In one locality there are\r\nsaid to be 520 wells, which yield annually 400,000 hogsheads of\r\npetroleum.[332]\r\n\r\n_Pitch lake of Trinidad._--Fluid bitumen is seen to ooze from the bottom\r\nof the sea, on both sides of the island of Trinidad, and to rise up to\r\nthe surface of the water. Near Cape La Braye there is a vortex which, in\r\nstormy weather, according to Captain Mallet, gushes out, raising the\r\nwater five or six feet, and covers the surface for a considerable space\r\nwith petroleum, or tar; and the same author quotes Gumilla, as stating,\r\nin his \"Description of the Orinoco,\" that about seventy years ago, a\r\nspot of land on the western coast of Trinidad, near half-way between the\r\ncapital and an Indian village, sank suddenly, and was immediately\r\nreplaced by a small lake of pitch, to the great terror of the\r\ninhabitants.[333]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the great pitch lake of Trinidad owes its origin to\r\na similar cause; and Dr. Nugent has justly remarked, that in that\r\ndistrict all the circumstances are now combined from which deposits of\r\npitch may have originated. The Orinoco has for ages been rolling down\r\ngreat quantities of woody and vegetable bodies into the surrounding sea,\r\nwhere, by the influence of currents and eddies, they may be arrested and\r\naccumulated in particular places. The frequent occurrence of earthquakes\r\nand other indications of volcanic action in those parts lend countenance\r\nto the opinion, that these vegetable substances may have undergone, by\r\nthe agency of subterranean fire, those transformations and chemical\r\nchanges which produce petroleum; and this may, by the same causes, be\r\nforced up to the surface, where, by exposure to the air, it becomes\r\ninspissated, and forms the different varieties of pure and earthy pitch,\r\nor asphaltum, so abundant in the island.[334]\r\n\r\nIt may be stated generally, that a large portion of the finer particles\r\nand the more crystalline substances, found in sedimentary rocks of\r\ndifferent ages, are composed of the same elements as are now held in\r\nsolution by springs, while the coarser materials bear an equally strong\r\nresemblance to the pebbles and sedimentary matter carried down by\r\ntorrents and rivers. It should also be remembered, that it is not only\r\nduring inundations, when the muddy sediment is apparent, that rivers are\r\nbusy in conveying solid matter to the sea, but that even when their\r\nwaters are perfectly transparent, they are annually bearing along vast\r\nmasses of carbon, lime, and silica to the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nREPRODUCTIVE EFFECTS OF RIVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lake deltas--Growth of the delta of the Upper Rhine in the Lake of\r\n    Geneva--Computation of the age of deltas--Recent deposits in Lake\r\n    Superior--Deltas of inland seas--Course of the Po--Artificial\r\n    embankments of the Po and Adige--Delta of the Po, and other rivers\r\n    entering the Adriatic--Rapid conversion of that gulf into\r\n    land--Mineral characters of the new deposits--Marine delta of the\r\n    Rhone--Various proofs of its increase--Stony nature of its\r\n    deposits--Coast of Asia Minor--Delta of the Nile.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELTAS IN LAKES.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken in the 14th chapter of the action of running\r\nwater, and of the denuding power of rivers, but we can only form a just\r\nconception of the excavating and removing force exerted by such bodies\r\nof water, when we have the advantage of examining the reproductive\r\neffects of the same agents: in other words, of beholding in a palpable\r\nform the aggregate amount of matter, which they have thrown down at\r\ncertain points in their alluvial plains, or in the basins of lakes and\r\nseas. Yet it will appear, when we consider the action of currents, that\r\nthe growth of deltas affords a very inadequate standard by which to\r\nmeasure the entire carrying power of running water, since a considerable\r\nportion of fluviatile sediment is swept far out to sea.\r\n\r\nDeltas may be divided into, first, those which are formed in lakes;\r\nsecondly, those in island seas, where the tides are almost\r\nimperceptible; and, thirdly, those on the borders of the ocean. The most\r\ncharacteristic distinction between the lacustrine and marine deltas\r\nconsists in the nature of the organic remains which become imbedded in\r\ntheir deposits; for, in the case of a lake, it is obvious that these\r\nmust consist exclusively of such genera of animals as inhabit the land\r\nor the waters of a river or a lake; whereas, in the other case, there\r\nwill be an admixture, and most frequently a predominance, of animals\r\nwhich inhabit salt water. In regard, however, to the distribution of\r\ninorganic matter, the deposits of lakes and seas are formed under very\r\nanalogous circumstances.\r\n\r\n_Lake of Geneva._--Lakes exemplify the first reproductive operations in\r\nwhich rivers are engaged when they convey the detritus of rocks and the\r\ningredients of mineral springs from mountainous regions. The accession\r\nof new land at the mouth of the Rhone, at the upper end of the Lake of\r\nGeneva, or the Leman Lake, presents us with an example of a considerable\r\nthickness of strata which have accumulated since the historical era.\r\nThis sheet of water is about thirty-seven miles long, and its breadth is\r\nfrom two to eight miles. The shape of the bottom is very irregular, the\r\ndepth having been found by late measurements to vary from 20 to 160\r\nfathoms.[335] The Rhone, where it enters at the upper end, is turbid and\r\ndiscolored; but its waters, where it issues at the town of Geneva, are\r\nbeautifully clear and transparent. An ancient town, called Port Vallais\r\n(Portus Valesiae of the Romans), once situated at the water's edge, at\r\nthe upper end, is now more than a mile and a half inland--this\r\nintervening alluvial tract having been acquired in about eight\r\ncenturies. The remainder of the delta consists of a flat alluvial plain,\r\nabout five or six miles in length, composed of sand and mud, a little\r\nraised above the level of the river, and full of marshes.\r\n\r\nSir Henry De la Beche found, after numerous soundings in all parts of\r\nthe lake, that there was a pretty uniform depth of from 120 to 160\r\nfathoms throughout the central region, and on approaching the delta, the\r\nshallowing of the bottom began to be very sensible at a distance of\r\nabout a mile and three quarters from the mouth of the Rhone; for a line\r\ndrawn from St. Gingoulph to Vevey gives a mean depth of somewhat less\r\nthan 600 feet, and from that part of the Rhone, the fluviatile mud is\r\nalways found along the bottom.[336] We may state, therefore, that the\r\nnew strata annually produced are thrown down upon a slope about two\r\nmiles in length; so that, notwithstanding the great depth of the lake,\r\nthe new deposits are inclined at so slight an angle, that the dip of the\r\nbeds would be termed, in ordinary geological language, horizontal.\r\n\r\nThe strata probably consist of alternations of finer and coarser\r\nparticles; for, during the hotter months from April to August, when the\r\nsnows melt, the volume and velocity of the river are greatest, and large\r\nquantities of sand, mud, vegetable matter, and drift-wood are\r\nintroduced; but during the rest of the year, the influx is comparatively\r\nfeeble, so much so, that the whole lake, according to Saussure, stands\r\nsix feet lower. If, then, we could obtain a section of the accumulation\r\nformed in the last eight centuries, we should see a great series of\r\nstrata, probably from 600 to 900 feet thick (the supposed original depth\r\nof the head of the lake), and nearly two miles in length, inclined at a\r\nvery slight angle. In the mean time, a great number of smaller deltas\r\nare growing around the borders of the lake, at the mouths of rapid\r\ntorrents, which pour in large masses of sand and pebbles. The body of\r\nwater in these torrents is too small to enable them to spread out the\r\ntransported matter over so extensive an area as the Rhone does. Thus,\r\nfor example, there is a depth of eighty fathoms within half a mile of\r\nthe shore, immediately opposite the great torrent which enters east of\r\nRipaille, so that the dip of the strata in that minor delta must be\r\nabout four times as great as those deposited by the main river at the\r\nupper extremity of the lake.[337]\r\n\r\n_Chronological computations of the age of deltas._--The capacity of this\r\nbasin being now ascertained, it would be an interesting subject of\r\ninquiry, to determine in what number of years the Leman Lake will be\r\nconverted into dry land. It would not be very difficult to obtain the\r\nelements for such a calculation, so as to approximate at least to the\r\nquantity of time required for the accomplishment of the result. The\r\nnumber of cubic feet of water annually discharged by the river into the\r\nlake being estimated, experiments might be made in the winter and summer\r\nmonths, to determine the proportion of matter held in suspension or in\r\nchemical solution by the Rhone. It would be also necessary to allow for\r\nthe heavier matter drifted along at the bottom, which might be estimated\r\non hydrostatical principles, when the average size of the gravel and the\r\nvolume and velocity of the stream at different seasons were known.\r\nSupposing all these observations to have been made, it would be more\r\neasy to calculate the future than the former progress of the delta,\r\nbecause it would be a laborious task to ascertain, with any degree of\r\nprecision, the original depth and extent of that part of the lake which\r\nis already filled up. Even if this information were actually obtained by\r\nborings, it would only enable us to approximate within a certain number\r\nof centuries to the time when the Rhone began to form its present delta;\r\nbut this would not give us the date of the origin of the Leman Lake in\r\nits present form, because the river may have flowed into it for\r\nthousands of years, without importing any sediment whatever. Such would\r\nhave been the case, if the waters had first passed through a chain of\r\nupper lakes; and that this was actually the fact, seems indicated by the\r\ncourse of the Rhone between Martigny and the Lake of Geneva, and, still\r\nmore decidedly, by the channels of many of its principal feeders.\r\n\r\nIf we ascend, for example, the valley through which the Dranse flows, we\r\nfind that it consists of a succession of basins, one above the other, in\r\neach of which there is a wide expanse of flat alluvial lands, separated\r\nfrom the next basin by a rocky gorge, once perhaps the barrier of a\r\nlake. The river seems to have filled these lakes, one after the other,\r\nand to have partially cut through the barriers, some of which it is\r\nstill gradually eroding to a greater depth. Before, therefore, we can\r\npretend even to hazard a conjecture as to the era at which the principal\r\ndelta of Lake Leman or any other delta commenced, we must be thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the geographical features and geological history of the\r\nwhole system of higher valleys which communicate with the main stream,\r\nand all the changes which they have undergone since the last series of\r\nconvulsions which agitated and altered the face of the country.\r\n\r\n_Lake Superior._--Lake Superior is the largest body of freshwater in the\r\nworld, being above 1700 geographical miles in circumference when we\r\nfollow the sinuosities of its coasts, and its length, on a curved line\r\ndrawn through its centre, being more than 400, and its extreme breadth\r\nabove 150 geographical miles. Its surface is nearly as large as the\r\nwhole of England. Its average depth varies from 80 to 150 fathoms; but,\r\naccording to Captain Bayfield, there is reason to think that its\r\ngreatest depth would not be overrated at 200 fathoms, so that its bottom\r\nis, in some parts, nearly 600 feet below the level of the Atlantic, its\r\nsurface being about as much above it. There are appearances in different\r\nparts of this, as of the other Canadian lakes, leading us to infer that\r\nits waters formerly occupied a higher level than they reach at present;\r\nfor at a considerable distance from the present shores, parallel lines\r\nof rolled stones and shells are seen rising one above the other, like\r\nthe seats of an amphitheatre. These ancient lines of shingle are exactly\r\nsimilar to the present beaches in most bays, and they often attain an\r\nelevation of 40 or 50 feet above the present level. As the heaviest\r\ngales of wind do not raise the waters more than three or four feet, the\r\nelevated beaches have by some been referred to the subsidence of the\r\nlake at former periods, in consequence of the wearing down of its\r\nbarrier; by others to the upraising of the shores by earthquakes, like\r\nthose which have produced similar phenomena on the coast of Chili.\r\n\r\nThe streams which discharge their waters into Lake Superior are several\r\nhundred in number, without reckoning those of smaller size; and the\r\nquantity of water supplied by them is many times greater than that\r\ndischarged at the Falls of St. Mary, the only outlet. The evaporation,\r\ntherefore, is very great, and such as might be expected from so vast an\r\nextent of surface. On the northern side, which is encircled by primary\r\nmountains, the rivers sweep in many large boulders with smaller gravel\r\nand sand, chiefly composed of granitic and trap rocks. There are also\r\ncurrents in the lake in various directions, caused by the continued\r\nprevalence of strong winds, and to their influence we may attribute the\r\ndiffusion of finer mud far and wide over great areas; for by numerous\r\nsoundings made during Captain Bayfield's survey, it was ascertained that\r\nthe bottom consists generally of a very adhesive clay, containing shells\r\nof the species at present existing in the lake. When exposed to the air,\r\nthis clay immediately becomes indurated in so great a degree, as to\r\nrequire a smart blow to break it. It effervesces slightly with diluted\r\nnitric acid, and is of different colors in different parts of the lake;\r\nin one district blue, in another red, and in a third white, hardening\r\ninto a substance resembling pipeclay.[338] From these statements, the\r\ngeologist will not fail to remark how closely these recent lacustrine\r\nformations in America resemble the tertiary argillaceous and calcareous\r\nmarls of lacustrine origin in Central France. In both cases many of the\r\ngenera of shells most abundant, as Limnea and Planorbis, are the same;\r\nand in regard to other classes of organic remains there must be the\r\nclosest analogy, as I shall endeavor more fully to explain when speaking\r\nof the imbedding of plants and animals in recent deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELTAS OF INLAND SEAS.\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly considered some of the lacustrine deltas now in\r\nprogress, we may next turn our attention to those of inland seas.\r\n\r\n_Course of the Po._--The Po affords an instructive example of the manner\r\nin which a great river bears down to the sea the matter poured into it\r\nby a multitude of tributaries descending from lofty chains of mountains.\r\nThe changes gradually effected in the great plain of Northern Italy,\r\nsince the time of the Roman republic, are considerable. Extensive lakes\r\nand marshes have been gradually filled up, as those near Placentia,\r\nParma, and Cremona, and many have been drained naturally by the\r\ndeepening of the beds of rivers. Deserted river-courses are not\r\nunfrequent, as that of the Serio Morto, which formerly fell into the\r\nAdda, in Lombardy. The Po also itself has often deviated from its\r\ncourse, having after the year 1390 deserted part of the territory of\r\nCremona, and invaded that of Parma; its old channel being still\r\nrecognizable, and bearing the name of Po Morto. There is also an old\r\nchannel of the Po in the territory of Parma, called Po Vecchio, which\r\nwas abandoned in the twelfth century, when a great number of towns were\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n_Artificial embankments of Italian rivers._--To check these and similar\r\naberrations, a general system of embankment has been adopted; and the\r\nPo, Adige, and almost all their tributaries, are now confined between\r\nhigh artificial banks. The increased velocity acquired by streams thus\r\nclosed in, enables them to convey a much larger portion of foreign\r\nmatter to the sea; and, consequently, the deltas of the Po and Adige\r\nhave gained far more rapidly on the Adriatic since the practice of\r\nembankment became almost universal. But, although more sediment is borne\r\nto the sea, part of the sand and mud, which in the natural state of\r\nthings would be spread out by annual inundations over the plain, now\r\nsubsides in the bottom of the river-channels; and their capacity being\r\nthereby diminished, it is necessary, in order to prevent inundations in\r\nthe following spring, to extract matter from the bed, and to add it to\r\nthe banks of the river. Hence it happens that these streams now traverse\r\nthe plain on the top of high mounds, like the waters of aqueducts, and\r\nat Ferrara the surface of the Po has become more elevated than the roofs\r\nof the houses.[339] The magnitude of these barriers is a subject of\r\nincreasing expense and anxiety, it having been sometimes found necessary\r\nto give an additional height of nearly one foot to the banks of the\r\nAdige and Po in a single season.\r\n\r\nThe practice of embankment was adopted on some of the Italian rivers as\r\nearly as the thirteenth century; and Dante, writing in the beginning of\r\nthe fourteenth, describes, in the seventh circle of hell, a rivulet of\r\ntears separated from a burning sandy desert by embankments \"like those\r\nwhich, between Ghent and Bruges, were raised against the ocean, or those\r\nwhich the Paduans had erected along the Brenta to defend their villas on\r\nthe melting of the Alpine snows.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Quale i Fiamminghi tra Guzzante e Bruggia,\r\n  Temendo il fiotto che in ver lor s'avventa,\r\n  Fanno lo schermo, perche il mar si fuggia,\r\n  E quale i Padovan lungo la Brenta,\r\n  Per difender lor ville e lor castelli,\r\n  Anzi che Chiarentana il caldo senta.--\r\n\r\n  _Inferno_, Canto xv.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Adriatic, from the northern part of the Gulf of Trieste, where\r\nthe Isonzo enters, down to the south of Ravenna, there is an\r\nuninterrupted series of recent accessions of land, more than 100 miles\r\nin length, which, within the last 2000 years, have increased from _two\r\nto twenty miles in breadth_. A line of sand-bars of great length has\r\nbeen formed nearly all along the western coast of this gulf, inside of\r\nwhich are lagunes, such as those of Venice, and the large lagune of\r\nComacchio, 20 miles in diameter. Newly deposited mud brought down by the\r\nstreams is continually lessening the depth of the lagunes, and\r\nconverting part of them into meadows.[340] The Isonzo, Tagliamento,\r\nPiave, Brenta, Adige, and Po, besides many other inferior rivers,\r\ncontribute to this advance of the coast-line and to the shallowing of\r\nthe lagunes and the gulf.\r\n\r\n_Delta of the Po._--The Po and the Adige may now be considered as\r\nentering by one common delta, for two branches of the Adige are\r\nconnected with arms of the Po, and thus the principal delta has been\r\npushed out beyond those bars which separate the lagunes from the sea.\r\nThe rate of the advance of this new land has been accelerated, as before\r\nstated, since the system of embanking the rivers became general,\r\nespecially at that point where the Po and Adige enter. The waters are no\r\nlonger permitted to spread themselves far and wide over the plains, and\r\nto leave behind them the larger portion of their sediment. Mountain\r\ntorrents also have become more turbid since the clearing away of\r\nforests, which once clothed the southern flanks of the Alps. It is\r\ncalculated that the mean rate of advance of the delta of the Po on the\r\nAdriatic between the years 1200 and 1600 was 25 yards or metres a year,\r\nwhereas the mean annual gain from 1600 to 1804 was 70 metres.[341]\r\n\r\nAdria was a seaport in the time of Augustus, and had, in ancient times,\r\ngiven its name to the gulf; it is now about twenty Italian miles inland.\r\nRavenna was also a seaport, and is now about four miles from the main\r\nsea. Yet even before the practice of embankment was introduced, the\r\nalluvium of the Po advanced with rapidity on the Adriatic; for Spina, a\r\nvery ancient city, originally built in the district of Ravenna, at the\r\nmouth of a great arm of the Po, was, so early as the commencement of our\r\nera, eleven miles distant from the sea.[342]\r\n\r\nBut although so many rivers are rapidly converting the Adriatic into\r\nland, it appears, by the observations of M. Morlot, that since the time\r\nof the Romans, there has been a general subsidence of the coast and bed\r\nof this sea in the same region to the amount of five feet, so that the\r\nadvance of the new-made land has not been so fast as it would have been\r\nhad the level of the coast remained unaltered. The signs of a much\r\ngreater depression anterior to the historical period have also been\r\nbrought to light by an Artesian well, bored in 1847, to the depth of\r\nmore than 400 feet, which still failed to penetrate through the modern\r\nfluviatile deposit. The auger passed chiefly through beds of sand and\r\nclay, but at four several depths, one of them very near the bottom of\r\nthe excavation, it pierced beds of turf, or accumulations of vegetable\r\nmatter, precisely similar to those now formed superficially on the\r\nextreme borders of the Adriatic. Hence we learn that a considerable area\r\nof what was once land has sunk down 400 feet in the course of ages.[343]\r\n\r\nThe greatest depth of the Adriatic, between Dalmatia and the mouths of\r\nthe Po, is twenty-two fathoms; but a large part of the Gulf of Trieste\r\nand the Adriatic, opposite Venice, is less than twelve fathoms deep.\r\nFarther to the south, where it is less affected by the influx of great\r\nrivers, the gulf deepens considerably. Donati, after dredging the\r\nbottom, discovered the new deposits to consist partly of mud and partly\r\nof rock, the rock being formed of calcareous matter, incrusting shells.\r\nHe also ascertained, that particular species of testacea were grouped\r\ntogether in certain places, and were becoming slowly incorporated with\r\nthe mud or calcareous precipitates.[344] Olivi, also, found some\r\ndeposits of sand, and others of mud, extending half way across the gulf;\r\nand he states that their distribution along the bottom was evidently\r\ndetermined by the prevailing current.[345] It is probable, therefore,\r\nthat the finer sediment of all the rivers at the head of the Adriatic\r\nmay be intermingled by the influence of the current; and all the central\r\nparts of the gulf may be considered as slowly filling up with horizontal\r\ndeposits, similar to those of the Subapennine hills, and containing many\r\nof the same species of shells. The Po merely introduces at present fine\r\nsand and mud, for it carries no pebbles farther than the spot where it\r\njoins the Trebia, west of Piacenza. Near the northern borders of the\r\nbasin, the Isonzo, Tagliamento, and many other streams, are forming\r\nimmense beds of sand and some conglomerate; for here some high mountains\r\nof Alpine limestone approach within a few miles of the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the Romans, the hot-baths of Monfalcone were on one of\r\nseveral islands of Alpine limestone, between which and the mainland, on\r\nthe north, was a channel of the sea, about a mile broad. This channel is\r\nnow converted into a grassy plain, which surrounds the islands on all\r\nsides. Among the numerous changes on this coast, we find that the\r\npresent channel of the Isonzo is several miles to the west of its\r\nancient bed, in part of which, at Ronchi, the old Roman bridge which\r\ncrossed the Via Appia was lately found buried in fluviatile silt.\r\n\r\n_Marine delta of the Rhone._--The lacustrine delta of the Rhone in\r\nSwitzerland has already been considered (p. 251), its contemporaneous\r\nmarine delta may now be described. Scarcely has the river passed out of\r\nthe Lake of Geneva before its pure waters are again filled with sand and\r\nsediment by the impetuous Arve, descending from the highest Alps, and\r\nbearing along in its current the granitic detritus annually brought down\r\nby the glaciers of Mont Blanc. The Rhone afterwards receives vast\r\ncontributions of transported matter from the Alps of Dauphiny, and the\r\nprimary and volcanic mountains of Central France; and when at length it\r\nenters the Mediterranean, it discolors the blue waters of that sea with\r\na whitish sediment, for the distance of between six and seven miles,\r\nthroughout which space the current of fresh water is perceptible.\r\n\r\nStrabo's description of the delta is so inapplicable to its present\r\nconfiguration, as to attest a complete alteration in the physical\r\nfeatures of the country since the Augustan age. It appears, however,\r\nthat the head of the delta, or the point at which it begins to ramify,\r\nhas remained unaltered since the time of Pliny, for he states that the\r\nRhone divided itself at Arles into two arms. This is the case at\r\npresent; one of the branches, the western, being now called Le Petit\r\nRhone, which is again subdivided before entering the Mediterranean. The\r\nadvance of the base of the delta, in the last eighteen centuries, is\r\ndemonstrated by many curious antiquarian monuments. The most striking of\r\nthese is the great and unnatural datour of the old Roman road from\r\nUgernum to Beziers (_Boeterrae_) which went round by Nismes\r\n(_Nemausus_). It is clear that, when this was first constructed, it was\r\nimpossible to pass in a direct line, as now, across the delta, and that\r\neither the sea or marshes intervened in a tract now consisting of terra\r\nfirma.[346] Astruc also remarks, that all the places on low lands, lying\r\nto the north of the old Roman road between Nismes and Beziers, have\r\nnames of Celtic origin, evidently given to them by the first inhabitants\r\nof the country; whereas, the places lying south of that road, towards\r\nthe sea, have names of Latin derivation, and were clearly founded after\r\nthe Roman language had been introduced.\r\n\r\nAnother proof, also, of the great extent of land which has come into\r\nexistence since the Romans conquered and colonized Gaul, is derived from\r\nthe fact, that the Roman writers never mention the thermal waters of\r\nBalaruc in the delta, although they were well acquainted with those of\r\nAix, and others still more distant, and attached great importance to\r\nthem, as they invariably did to all hot springs. The waters of Balaruc,\r\ntherefore, must have formerly issued under the sea--a common phenomenon\r\non the borders of the Mediterranean; and on the advance of the delta\r\nthey continued to flow out through the new deposits.\r\n\r\nAmong the more direct proofs of the increase of land, we find that Mese,\r\ndescribed under the appellation of Mesua Collis by Pomponius Mela,[347]\r\nand stated by him to be nearly an island, is now far inland. Notre Dame\r\ndes Ports, also, was a harbor in 898, but is now a league from the\r\nshore. Psalmodi was an island in 815, and is now two leagues from the\r\nsea. Several old lines of towers and sea-marks occur at different\r\ndistances from the present coast, all indicating the successive retreat\r\nof the sea, for each line has in its turn become useless to mariners;\r\nwhich may well be conceived, when we state that the Tower of Tignaux,\r\nerected on the shore so late as the year 1737, is already a mile remote\r\nfrom it.[348]\r\n\r\nBy the confluence of the Rhone and the currents of the Mediterranean,\r\ndriven by winds from the south, sand-bars are often formed across the\r\nmouths of the river; by these means considerable spaces become divided\r\noff from the sea, and subsequently from the river also, when it shifts\r\nits channels of efflux. As some of these lagoons are subject to the\r\noccasional ingress of the river when flooded, and of the sea during\r\nstorms, they are alternately salt and fresh. Others, after being filled\r\nwith salt water, are often lowered by evaporation till they become more\r\nsalt than the sea; and it has happened, occasionally, that a\r\nconsiderable precipitate of muriate of soda has taken place in these\r\nnatural salterns. During the latter part of Napoleon's career, when the\r\nexcise laws were enforced with extreme rigor, the police was employed to\r\nprevent such salt from being used. The fluviatile and marine shells\r\ninclosed in these small lakes often live together in brackish water; but\r\nthe uncongenial nature of the fluid usually produces a dwarfish size,\r\nand sometimes gives rise to strange varieties in form and color.\r\n\r\nCaptain Smyth in his survey of the coast of the Mediterranean, found the\r\nsea opposite the mouth of the Rhone, to deepen gradually from four to\r\nforty fathoms, within a distance of six or seven miles, over which the\r\ndiscolored fresh water extends; so that the inclination of the new\r\ndeposits must be too slight to be appreciable in such an extent of\r\nsection as a geologist usually obtains in examining ancient formations.\r\nWhen the wind blew from the southwest, the ships employed in the survey\r\nwere obliged to quit their moorings; and when they returned, the new\r\nsand-banks in the delta were found covered over with a great abundance\r\nof marine shells. By this means, we learn how occasional beds of drifted\r\nmarine shells may become interstratified with freshwater strata at a\r\nriver's mouth.\r\n\r\n_Stony nature of its deposits._--That a great proportion, at least, of\r\nthe new deposit in the delta of the Rhone consists of _rock_, and not of\r\nloose incoherent matter, is perfectly ascertained. In the Museum at\r\nMontpelier is a cannon taken up from the sea near the mouth of the\r\nriver, imbedded in a crystalline calcareous rock. Large masses, also,\r\nare continually taken up of an arenaceous rock, cemented by calcareous\r\nmatter, including multitudes of broken shells of recent species. The\r\nobservations lately made on this subject corroborate the former\r\nstatement of Marsilli, that the earthy deposits of the coast of\r\nLanguedoc form a stony substance, for which reason he ascribes a certain\r\nbituminous, saline, and glutinous nature to the substances brought down\r\nwith sand by the Rhone.[349] If the number of mineral springs charged\r\nwith carbonate of lime which fall into the Rhone and its feeders in\r\ndifferent parts of France be considered, we shall feel no surprise at\r\nthe lapidification of the newly deposited sediment in this delta. It\r\nshould be remembered, that the fresh water introduced by rivers being\r\nlighter than the water of the sea, floats over the latter, and remains\r\nupon the surface for a considerable distance. Consequently it is exposed\r\nto as much evaporation as the waters of a lake; and the area over which\r\nthe river-water is spread, at the junction of great rivers and the sea,\r\nmay well be compared, in point of extent, to that of considerable lakes.\r\n\r\nNow, it is well known, that so great is the quantity of water carried\r\noff by evaporation in some lakes, that it is nearly equal to the water\r\nflowing in; and in some inland seas, as the Caspian, it is quite equal.\r\nWe may, therefore, well suppose that, in cases where a strong current\r\ndoes not interfere, the greater portion not only of the matter held\r\nmechanically in suspension, but of that also which is in chemical\r\nsolution, may be precipitated at no great distance from the shore. When\r\nthese finer ingredients are extremely small in quantity, they may only\r\nsuffice to supply crustaceous animals, corals, and marine plants, with\r\nthe earthy particles necessary for their secretions; but whenever it is\r\nin excess (as generally happens if the basin of a river lie partly in a\r\ndistrict of active or extinct volcanoes), then will solid deposits be\r\nformed, and the shells will at once be included in a rocky mass.\r\n\r\n_Coast of Asia Minor._--Examples of the advance of the land upon the sea\r\nare afforded by the southern coast of Asia Minor. Admiral Sir F.\r\nBeaufort has pointed out in his survey the great alterations effected\r\nsince the time of Strabo, where havens are filled up, islands joined to\r\nthe mainland, and where the whole continent has increased many miles in\r\nextent. Strabo himself, on comparing the outline of the coast in his\r\ntime with its ancient state, was convinced, like our countryman, that\r\nit had gained very considerably upon the sea. The new-formed strata of\r\nAsia Minor consist _of stone_, not of loose incoherent materials. Almost\r\nall the streamlets and rivers, like many of those in Tuscany and the\r\nsouth of Italy, hold abundance of carbonate of lime in solution, and\r\nprecipitate travertin, or sometimes bind together the sand and gravel\r\ninto solid sandstones and conglomerates; every delta and sand-bar thus\r\nacquires solidity, which often prevents streams from forcing their way\r\nthrough them, so that their mouths are constantly changing their\r\nposition.[350]\r\n\r\n_Delta of the Nile._--That Egypt was \"the gift of the Nile,\" was the\r\nopinion of her priests before the time of Herodotus; and Rennell\r\nobserves, that the \"configuration and composition of the low lands leave\r\nno room for doubt that the sea once washed the base of the rocks on\r\nwhich the pyramids of Memphis stand, the _present_ base of which is\r\nwashed by the inundation of the Nile, at an elevation of 70 or 80 feet\r\nabove the Mediterranean. But when we attempt to carry back our ideas to\r\nthe remote period when the foundation of the delta was first laid, we\r\nare lost in the contemplation of so vast an interval of time.\"[351]\r\nHerodotus observes, \"that the country round Memphis seemed formerly to\r\nhave been an arm of the sea gradually filled by the Nile, in the same\r\nmanner as the Meander, Achelous, and other streams, had formed deltas.\r\nEgypt, therefore, he says, like the Red Sea, was once a long narrow bay,\r\nand both gulfs were separated by a small neck of land. If the Nile, he\r\nadds, should by any means have an issue into the Arabian Gulf, it might\r\nchoke it up with earth in 20,000 or even, perhaps, in 10,000 years; and\r\nwhy may not the Nile have filled a still greater gulf with mud in the\r\nspace of time which has passed before our age?\"[352]\r\n\r\nThe distance between Memphis and the most prominent part of the delta in\r\na straight line north and south, is about 100 geographical miles; the\r\nlength of the base of the delta is more than 200 miles if we follow the\r\ncoast between the ancient extreme eastern and western arms; but as these\r\nare now blocked up, that part only of Lower Egypt which intervenes\r\nbetween the Rosetta and Damietta branches, is usually called the delta,\r\nthe coast line of which is about 90 miles in length. The bed of the\r\nriver itself, says Sir J. G. Wilkinson, undergoes a gradual increase of\r\nelevation varying in different places, and always lessening in\r\nproportion as the river approaches the sea. \"This increase of elevation\r\nin perpendicular height is much smaller in Lower than in Upper Egypt,\r\nand in the delta it diminishes still more; so that, according to an\r\napproximate calculation, the land about Elephantine, or the first\r\ncataract, lat. 24 degrees 5 minutes, has been raised nine feet in 1700\r\nyears; at Thebes, lat. 25 degrees 43 minutes, about seven feet; and at\r\nHeliopolis and Cairo, lat. 30 degrees, about five feet ten inches. At\r\nRosetta and the mouths of the Nile, lat. 31 degrees 30 minutes, the\r\ndiminution in the perpendicular thickness of the deposit is lessened in\r\na much greater decreasing ratio than in the straitened valley of Central\r\nand Upper Egypt, owing to the great extent, east and west, over which\r\nthe inundation spreads.\"[353]\r\n\r\nFor this reason the alluvial deposit does not cause the delta to\r\nprotrude rapidly into the sea, although some ancient cities are now a\r\nmile or more inland, and the mouths of the Nile, mentioned by the\r\nearlier geographers, have been many of them silted up, and the outline\r\nof the coast entirely changed.\r\n\r\nThe bed of the Nile always keeps pace with the general elevation of the\r\nsoil, and the banks of this river, like those of the Mississippi and its\r\ntributaries (see p. 265), are much higher than the flat land at a\r\ndistance, so that they are seldom covered during the highest\r\ninundations. In consequence of the gradual rise of the river's bed, the\r\nannual flood is constantly spreading over a wider area, and the alluvial\r\nsoil encroaches on the desert, covering, to the depth of six or seven\r\nfeet, the base of statues and temples which the waters never reached\r\n3000 years ago. Although the sands of the Libyan deserts have in some\r\nplaces been drifted into the valley of the Nile, yet these aggressions,\r\nsays Wilkinson, are far more than counterbalanced by the fertilizing\r\neffect of the water which now reaches farther inland towards the desert,\r\nso that the number of square miles of arable soil is greater at present\r\nthan at any previous period.\r\n\r\n_Mud of the Nile._--On comparing the different analyses which have been\r\npublished of this mud, it will be found that it contains a large\r\nquantity of argillaceous matter, with much peroxide of iron, some\r\ncarbonate of lime, and a small proportion of carbonate of magnesia. The\r\nlatest and most careful analysis by M. Lassaigne shows a singularly\r\nclose resemblance in the proportions of the ingredients of silica,\r\nalumina, iron, carbon, lime, and magnesia, and those observed in\r\nordinary mica;[354] but a much larger quantity of calcareous matter is\r\nsometimes present.\r\n\r\nIn many places, as at Cairo, where artificial excavations have been\r\nmade, or where the river has undermined its banks, the mud is seen to be\r\nthinly stratified, the upper part of each annual layer consisting of\r\nearth of a lighter color than the lower, and the whole separating easily\r\nfrom the deposit of the succeeding year. These annual layers are\r\nvariable in thickness; but, according to the calculations of Girard and\r\nWilkinson, the mean annual thickness of a layer at Cairo cannot exceed\r\nthat of a sheet of thin pasteboard, and a stratum of two or three feet\r\nmust represent the accumulation of a thousand years.\r\n\r\nThe depth of the Mediterranean is about twelve fathoms at a small\r\ndistance from the shore of the delta; it afterwards increases gradually\r\nto 50, and then suddenly descends to 380 fathoms, which is, perhaps, the\r\noriginal depth of the sea where it has not been rendered shallower by\r\nfluviatile matter. We learn from Lieut. Newbold that nothing but the\r\nfinest and lightest ingredients reach the Mediterranean, where he has\r\nobserved the sea discolored by them to the distance of 40 miles from the\r\nshore.[355] The small progress of the delta in the last 2000 years\r\naffords, perhaps, no measure for estimating its rate of growth when it\r\nwas an inland bay, and had not yet protruded itself beyond the\r\ncoast-line of the Mediterranean. A powerful current now sweeps along the\r\nshores of Africa, from the Straits of Gibraltar to the prominent\r\nconvexity of Egypt, the western side of which is continually the prey of\r\nthe waves; so that not only are fresh accessions of land checked, but\r\nancient parts of the delta are carried away. By this cause, Canopus and\r\nsome other towns have been overwhelmed; but to this subject I shall\r\nagain refer when speaking of tides and currents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nREPRODUCTIVE EFFECTS OF RIVERS--_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Deltas formed under the influence of tides--Basin and delta of the\r\n    Mississippi--Alluvial plain--River-banks and bluffs--Curves of the\r\n    river--Natural rafts and snags--New lakes, and effects of\r\n    earthquakes--Antiquity of the delta--Delta of the Ganges and\r\n    Brahmapootra--Head of the delta and Sunderbunds--Islands formed and\r\n    destroyed--Crocodiles--Amount of fluviatile sediment in the\r\n    water--Artesian boring at Calcutta--Proofs of subsidence--Age of the\r\n    delta--Convergence of deltas--Origin of existing deltas not\r\n    contemporaneous--Grouping of strata and stratification in\r\n    deltas--Conglomerates--Constant interchange of land and sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter several examples were given of the deltas of inland\r\nseas, where the influence of the tides is almost imperceptible. We may\r\nnext consider those marine or oceanic deltas, where the tides play an\r\nimportant part in the dispersion of fluviatile sediment, as in the Gulf\r\nof Mexico, where they exert a moderate degree of force, and then in the\r\nBay of Bengal, where they are extremely powerful. In regard to\r\nestuaries, which Rennel termed \"negative deltas,\" they will be treated\r\nof more properly when our attention is specially turned to the\r\noperations of tides and currents (chapters 20, 21, and 22). In this\r\ncase, instead of the land gaining on the sea at the river's mouth, the\r\ntides penetrate far inland beyond the general coast-line.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIN AND DELTA OF THE MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\n_Alluvial plain._--The hydrographical basin of the Mississippi displays,\r\non the grandest scale, the action of running water on the surface of a\r\nvast continent. This magnificent river rises nearly in the forty-ninth\r\nparallel of north latitude, and flows to the Gulf of Mexico in the\r\ntwenty-ninth--a course, including its meanders, of more than three\r\nthousand miles. It passes from a cold climate, where the hunter obtains\r\nhis furs and peltries, traverses the temperate latitudes, and discharges\r\nits waters into the sea in the region of rice, the cotton plant, and the\r\nsugar-cane. From near its mouth at the Balize a steamboat may ascend for\r\n2000 miles with scarcely any perceptible difference in the width of the\r\nriver. Several of its tributaries, the Red River, the Arkansas, the\r\nMissouri, the Ohio, and others, would be regarded elsewhere as of the\r\nfirst importance, and, taken together, are navigable for a distance many\r\ntimes exceeding that of the main stream. No river affords a more\r\nstriking illustration of the law before mentioned, that an augmentation\r\nof volume does not occasion a proportional increase of surface, nay, is\r\neven sometimes attended with a narrowing of the channel. The Mississippi\r\nis half a mile wide at its junction with the Missouri, the latter being\r\nalso of equal width; yet the united waters have only, from their\r\nconfluence to the mouth of the Ohio, a medial width of about half a\r\nmile. The junction of the Ohio seems also to produce no increase, but\r\nrather a decrease, of surface.[356] The St. Francis, White, Arkansas,\r\nand Red rivers are also absorbed by the main stream with scarcely any\r\napparent increase of its width, although here and there it expands to a\r\nbreadth of 1-1/2, or even to 2 miles. On arriving at New Orleans, it is\r\nsomewhat less than half a mile wide. Its depth there is very variable,\r\nthe greatest at high water being 168 feet. The mean rate at which the\r\nwhole body of water flows is variously estimated; according to Mr.\r\nForshey the mean velocity of the current at the surface, somewhat\r\nexceeds 2-1/4 miles an hour when the water is at a mean height. For 300\r\nmiles above New Orleans the distance measured by the winding river is\r\nabout twice as great as the distance in a right line. For the first 100\r\nmiles from the mouth the rate of fall is 1.80 inch per mile, for the\r\nsecond hundred 2 inches, for the third 2.30, for the fourth 2.57.\r\n\r\nThe alluvial plain of the Mississippi begins to be of great width below\r\nCape Girardeau, 50 miles above the junction of the Ohio. At this\r\njunction it is about 50 miles broad, south of which it contracts to\r\nabout 30 miles at Memphis, expands again to 80 miles at the mouth of the\r\nWhite River, and then, after various contractions and expansions,\r\nprotrudes beyond the general coast-line, in a large delta, about 90\r\nmiles in width, from N. E. to S. W. Mr. Forshey estimates the area of\r\nthe great plain as above defined at 31,200 square miles, with a\r\ncircumference of about 3000 miles, exceeding the area of Ireland. If\r\nthat part of this plain which lies below, or to the south of the\r\nbranching off of the highest arm, called the Atchafalaya, be termed the\r\ndelta, it constitutes less than half of the whole, being 14,000 square\r\nBritish miles in area. The delta may be said to be bounded on the east,\r\nwest, and south by the sea; on the north chiefly by the broad\r\nvalley-plain which entirely resembles it in character as in origin. The\r\neast and west boundaries of the alluvial region above the head of the\r\ndelta consists of cliffs or bluffs, which on the east side of the\r\nMississippi are very abrupt, and are undermined by the river at many\r\npoints. They consist, from Baton Rouge in Louisiana, where they\r\ncommence, as far north as the borders of Kentucky, of geological\r\nformations newer than the cretaceous, the lowest being Eocene, and the\r\nuppermost consisting of loam, resembling the loess of the Rhine, and\r\ncontaining freshwater and land shells almost all of existing species.\r\n(See fig. 23.) These recent shells are associated with the bones of the\r\nmastodon, elephant, tapir, mylodon, horse, ox, and other quadrupeds,\r\nmost of them of extinct species.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to show in my Second Visit to the United States, that\r\nthis extensive formation of loam is either an ancient alluvial plain or\r\na delta of the great river, formed originally at a lower level, and\r\nsince upheaved, and partially denuded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.\r\n\r\nVALLEY OF THE MISSISSIPPI.]\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi in that part of its course which is below the mouth of\r\nthe Ohio, frequently washes the eastern bluffs, but never once comes in\r\ncontact with the western. These are composed of similar formations; but\r\nI learn from Mr. Forshey that they rise up more gently from the alluvial\r\nplain (as at _a_, fig. 23). It is supposed that the waters are thrown to\r\nthe eastern side, because all the large tributary rivers entering from\r\nthe west have filled that side of the great valley with their deltas, or\r\nwith a sloping mass of clay and sand; so that the opposite bluffs are\r\nundermined, and the Mississippi is slowly but incessantly advancing\r\neastward.[357]\r\n\r\n_Curves of the Mississippi._--The river traverses the plain in a\r\nmeandering course, describing immense curves. After sweeping round the\r\nhalf of a circle, it is carried in a rapid current diagonally across the\r\nordinary direction of its channel, to another curve of similar shape.\r\nOpposite to each of these, there is always a sand-bar, answering, in the\r\nconvexity of its form, to the concavity of \"the bend,\" as it is\r\ncalled.[358] The river, by continually wearing these curves deep,\r\nreturns, like many other streams before described, on its own track, so\r\nthat a vessel in some places, after sailing for twenty-five or thirty\r\nmiles, is brought round again to within a mile of the place whence it\r\nstarted. When the waters approach so near to each other, it often\r\nhappens at high floods that they burst through the small tongue of\r\nland, and insulate a portion, rushing through what is called the\r\n\"cut-off,\" so that vessels may pass from one point to another in half a\r\nmile to a distance which it previously required a voyage of twenty miles\r\nto reach. As soon as the river has excavated the new passage, bars of\r\nsand and mud are formed at the two points of junction with the old bend,\r\nwhich is soon entirely separated from the main river by a continuous\r\nmud-bank covered with wood. The old bend then becomes a semicircular\r\nlake of clear water, inhabited by large gar-fish, alligators, and wild\r\nfowl, which the steam-boats have nearly driven away from the main\r\nriver. A multitude of such crescent-shaped lakes, scattered far and wide\r\nover the alluvial plain, the greater number of them to the west, but\r\nsome of them also eastward of the Mississippi, bear testimony of the\r\nextensive wanderings of the great stream in former ages. For the last\r\ntwo hundred miles above its mouth the course of the river is much less\r\nwinding than above, there being only in the whole of that distance one\r\ngreat curve, that called the \"English Turn.\" This great straightness of\r\nthe stream is ascribed by Mr. Forshey to the superior tenacity of the\r\nbanks, which are more clayey in this region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.\r\n\r\nSection of channel, bank, levees (_a_ and _b_), and swamps of\r\nMississippi river.]\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi has been incorrectly described by some of the earlier\r\ngeographers, as a river running along the top of a long hill, or mound\r\nin a plain. In reality it runs in a valley, from 100 to 200 or more feet\r\nin depth, as _a_, _c_, _b_, fig. 24, its banks forming long strips of\r\nland parallel to the course of the main stream, and to the swamps _g_,\r\n_f_, and _d_, _e_, lying on each side. These extensive morasses, which\r\nare commonly well-wooded, though often submerged for months\r\ncontinuously, are rarely more than fifteen feet below the summit level\r\nof the banks. The banks themselves are occasionally overflowed, but are\r\nusually above water for a breadth of about two miles. They follow all\r\nthe curves of the great river, and near New Orleans are raised\r\nartificially by embankments (or levees), _a b_, fig. 24, through which\r\nthe river when swollen sometimes cuts a deep channel (or crevasse),\r\ninundating the adjoining low lands and swamps, and not sparing the lower\r\nstreets of the great city.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the uniform upward slope of the river-bank above the\r\nadjoining alluvial plain is this: when the waters charged with sediment\r\npass over the banks in the flood season, their velocity is checked among\r\nthe herbage and reeds, and they throw down at once the coarser and more\r\nsandy matter with which they are charged. But the fine particles of mud\r\nare carried farther on, so that at the distance of about two miles, a\r\nthin film of fine clay only subsides, forming a stiff unctuous black\r\nsoil, which gradually envelops the base of trees growing on the borders\r\nof the swamps.\r\n\r\n_Waste of the banks._--It has been said of a mountain torrent, that \"it\r\nlays down what it will remove, and removes what it has laid down;\" and\r\nin like manner the Mississippi, by the continual shifting of its course,\r\nsweeps away, during a great portion of the year, considerable tracts of\r\nalluvium, which were gradually accumulated by the overflow of former\r\nyears, and the matter now left during the spring-floods will be at some\r\nfuture time removed. After the flood season, when the river subsides\r\nwithin its channel, it acts with destructive force upon the alluvial\r\nbanks, softened and diluted by the recent overflow. Several acres at a\r\ntime, thickly covered with wood, are precipitated into the stream; and\r\nlarge portions of the islands are frequently swept away.\r\n\r\n\"Some years ago,\" observes Captain Hall, \"when the Mississippi was\r\nregularly surveyed, all its islands were numbered, from the confluence\r\nof the Missouri to the sea; but every season makes such revolutions, not\r\nonly in the number, but in the magnitude and situation of these islands,\r\nthat this enumeration is now almost obsolete. Sometimes large islands\r\nare entirely melted away; at other places they have attached themselves\r\nto the main shore, or, which is the more correct statement, the interval\r\nhas been filled up by myriads of logs cemented together by mud and\r\nrubbish.\"[359]\r\n\r\n_Rafts._--One of the most interesting features in the great rivers of\r\nthis part of America is the frequent accumulation of what are termed\r\n\"rafts,\" or masses of floating trees, which have been arrested in their\r\nprogress by snags, islands, shoals, or other obstructions, and made to\r\naccumulate, so as to form natural bridges, reaching entirely across the\r\nstream. One of the largest of these was called the raft of the\r\nAtchafalaya, an arm of the Mississippi, which was certainly at some\r\nformer time the channel of the Red River, when the latter found its way\r\nto the Gulf of Mexico by a separate course. The Atchafalaya being in a\r\ndirect line with the general direction of the Mississippi, catches a\r\nlarge portion of the timber annually brought down from the north; and\r\nthe drift-trees collected in about thirty-eight years previous to 1816\r\nformed a continuous raft, no less than ten miles in length, 220 yards\r\nwide, and eight feet deep. The whole rose and fell with the water, yet\r\nwas covered with green bushes and trees, and its surface enlivened in\r\nthe autumn by a variety of beautiful flowers. It went on increasing till\r\nabout 1835, when some of the trees upon it had grown to the height of\r\nabout sixty feet. Steps were then taken by the State of Louisiana to\r\nclear away the whole raft, and open the navigation, which was effected,\r\nnot without great labor, in the space of four years.\r\n\r\nThe rafts on Red River are equally remarkable: in some parts of its\r\ncourse, cedar-trees are heaped up by themselves, and in other places,\r\npines. On the rise of the waters in summer hundreds of these are seen,\r\nsome with their green leaves still upon them, just as they have fallen\r\nfrom a neighboring bank, others leafless, broken and worn in their\r\npassage from a far distant tributary: wherever they accumulate on the\r\nedge of a sand-bar they arrest the current, and soon become covered with\r\nsediment. On this mud the young willows and the poplars called\r\ncotton-wood spring up, their boughs still farther retarding the stream,\r\nand as the inundation rises, accelerating the deposition of new soil.\r\nThe bank continuing to enlarge, the channel at length becomes so narrow\r\nthat a single long tree may reach from side to side, and the remaining\r\nspace is then soon choked up by a quantity of other timber.\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately for the navigation of the Mississippi,\" observes Captain\r\nHall, \"some of the largest trunks, after being cast down from the\r\nposition on which they grew, get their roots entangled with the bottom\r\nof the river, where they remain anchored, as it were, in the mud. The\r\nforce of the current naturally gives their tops a tendency downwards,\r\nand, by its flowing past, soon strips them of their leaves and branches.\r\nThese fixtures, called snags, or planters, are extremely dangerous to\r\nthe steam-vessels proceeding up the stream, in which they lie like a\r\nlance in rest, concealed beneath the water, with their sharp ends\r\npointed directly against the bows of the vessels coming up. For the most\r\npart these formidable snags remain so still that they can be detected\r\nonly by a slight ripple above them, not perceptible to inexperienced\r\neyes. Sometimes, however, they vibrate up and down, alternately showing\r\ntheir heads above the surface and bathing them beneath it.\"[360] So\r\nimminent, until lately, was the danger caused by these obstructions,\r\nthat almost all the boats on the Mississippi were constructed on a\r\nparticular plan, to guard against fatal accidents; but in the last ten\r\nyears, by the aid of the power of steam and the machinery of a\r\nsnag-boat, as it is called, the greater number of these trunks of trees\r\nhave been drawn out of the mud.[361]\r\n\r\nThe prodigious quantity of wood annually drifted down by the Mississippi\r\nand its tributaries, is a subject of geological interest, not merely as\r\nillustrating the manner in which abundance of vegetable matter becomes,\r\nin the ordinary course of nature, imbedded in submarine and estuary\r\ndeposits, but as attesting the constant destruction of soil and\r\ntransportation of matter to lower levels by the tendency of rivers to\r\nshift their courses. Each of these trees must have required many years,\r\nsome of them centuries, to attain their full size; the soil, therefore,\r\nwhereon they grew, after remaining undisturbed for long periods, is\r\nultimately torn up and swept away.\r\n\r\nIt is also found in excavating at New Orleans, even at the depth of\r\nseveral yards below the level of the sea, that the soil of the delta\r\ncontains innumerable trunks of trees, layer above layer, some prostrate,\r\nas if drifted, others broken off near the bottom, but remaining still\r\nerect, and with their roots spreading on all sides, as if in their\r\nnatural position. In such situations they appeared to me to indicate a\r\nsinking of the ground, as the trees must formerly have grown in marshes\r\nabove the sea-level. In the higher parts of the alluvial plain, for many\r\nhundred miles above the head of the delta, similar stools and roots of\r\ntrees are also seen buried in stiff clay at different levels, one above\r\nthe other, and exposed to view in the banks at low water. They point\r\nclearly to the successive growth of forests in the extensive swamps of\r\nthe plain, where the ground was slowly raised, year after year, by the\r\nmud thrown down during inundations. These roots and stools belong\r\nchiefly to the deciduous cypress (_Taxodium distichum_), and other\r\nswamp-trees, and they bear testimony to the constant shifting of the\r\ncourse of the great river, which is always excavating land originally\r\nformed at some distance from its banks.\r\n\r\n_Formation of lakes in Louisiana._.--Another striking feature in the\r\nbasin of the Mississippi, illustrative of the changes now in progress,\r\nis the formation by natural causes of great lakes, and the drainage of\r\nothers. These are especially frequent in the basin of the Red River in\r\nLouisiana, where the largest of them, called Bistineau, is more than\r\n_thirty miles_ long, and has a medium depth of from _fifteen_ to\r\n_twenty_ feet. In the deepest parts are seen numerous cypress-trees, of\r\nall sizes, now dead, and most of them with their tops broken by the\r\nwind, yet standing erect under water. This tree resists the action of\r\nair and water longer than any other, and, if not submerged throughout\r\nthe whole year, will retain life for an extraordinary period. Lake\r\nBistineau, as well as Black Lake, Cado Lake, Spanish Lake, Natchitoches\r\nLake, and many others, have been formed, according to Darby, by the\r\ngradual elevation of the bed of Red River, in which the alluvial\r\naccumulations have been so great as to raise its channel, and cause its\r\nwaters, during the flood season, to flow up the mouths of many\r\ntributaries, and to convert parts of their courses into lakes. In the\r\nautumn, when the level of Red River is again depressed, the waters rush\r\nback, and some lakes become grassy meadows, with streams meandering\r\nthrough them.[362] Thus, there is a periodical flux and reflux between\r\nRed River and some of these basins, which are merely reservoirs,\r\nalternately emptied and filled, like our tide estuaries--with this\r\ndifference, that in the one case the land is submerged for several\r\nmonths continuously, and in the other twice in every twenty-four hours.\r\nIt has happened, in several cases, that a raft of timber or a bar has\r\nbeen thrown by Red River across some of the openings of these channels,\r\nand then the lakes become, like Bistineau, constant repositories of\r\nwater. But, even in these cases, their level is liable to annual\r\nelevation and depression, because the flood of the main river, when at\r\nits height, passes over the bar; just as, where sand-hills close the\r\nentrance of an estuary on the Norfolk or Suffolk coast, the sea, during\r\nsome high tide or storm, has often breached the barrier and inundated\r\nagain the interior.\r\n\r\nI am informed by Mr. Featherstonhaugh that the plains of the Red River\r\nand the Arkansas are so low and flat, that whenever the Mississippi\r\nrises thirty feet above its ordinary level, those great tributaries are\r\nmade to flow back, and inundate a region of vast extent. Both the\r\nstreams alluded to contain red sediment, derived from the decomposition\r\nof red porphyry; and since 1833, when there was a great inundation in\r\nthe Arkansas, an immense swamp has been formed near the Mammelle\r\nmountain, comprising 30,000 acres, with here and there large lagoons,\r\nwhere the old bed of the river was situated; in which innumerable trees,\r\nfor the most part dead, are seen standing, of cypress, cotton-wood, or\r\npoplar, the triple-thorned acacia, and others, which are of great size.\r\nTheir trunks appear as if painted red for about fifteen feet from the\r\nground; at which height a perfectly level line extends through the whole\r\nforest, marking the rise of the waters during the last flood.[363]\r\n\r\nBut most probably the causes above assigned for the recent origin of\r\nthese lakes are not the only ones. Subterranean movements have altered,\r\nso lately as the years 1811-12, the relative levels of various parts of\r\nthe basin of the Mississippi, situated 300 miles northeast of Lake\r\nBistineau. In those years the great valley, from the mouth of the Ohio\r\nto that of the St. Francis, including a tract 300 miles in length, and\r\nexceeding in area the whole basin of the Thames, was convulsed to such a\r\ndegree, as to create new islands in the river, and lakes in the alluvial\r\nplain. Some of these were on the left or east bank of the Mississippi,\r\nand were twenty miles in extent; as, for example, those named Reelfoot\r\nand Obion in Tennessee, formed in the channels or valleys of small\r\nstreams bearing the same names.[364]\r\n\r\nBut the largest area affected by the great convulsion lies eight or ten\r\nmiles to the westward of the Mississippi, and inland from the town of\r\nNew Madrid, in Missouri. It is called \"the sunk country,\" and is said\r\nto extend along the course of the White Water and its tributaries, for\r\na distance of between seventy and eighty miles north and south, and\r\nthirty miles or more east and west. Throughout this area, innumerable\r\nsubmerged trees, some standing leafless, others prostrate, are seen; and\r\nso great is the extent of lake and marsh, that an active trade in the\r\nskins of muskrats, mink, otters, and other wild animals, is now carried\r\non there. In March, 1846, I skirted the borders of the \"sunk country\"\r\nnearest to New Madrid, passing along the Bayou St. John and Little\r\nPrairie, where dead trees of various kinds, some erect in the water,\r\nothers fallen, and strewed in dense masses over the bottom, in the\r\nshallows, and near the shore, were conspicuous. I also beheld countless\r\nrents in the adjoining dry alluvial plains, caused by the movements of\r\nthe soil in 1811-12, and still open, though the rains, frost, and river\r\ninundations, have greatly diminished their original depth. I observed,\r\nmoreover, numerous circular cavities, called \"sunk holes,\" from ten to\r\nthirty yards wide, and twenty feet or more in depth, which interrupt the\r\ngeneral level of the plain. These were formed by the spouting out of\r\nlarge quantities of sand and mud during the earthquakes.[365]\r\n\r\nThat the prevailing changes of level in the delta and alluvial plain of\r\nthe Mississippi have been caused by the subsidence, rather than the\r\nupheaval of land, appears to me established by the fact, that there are\r\nno protuberances of upraised alluvial soil, projecting above the level\r\nsurface of the great plain. It is true that the gradual elevation of\r\nthat plain, by new accessions of matter, would tend to efface every\r\ninequality derived from this source, but we might certainly have\r\nexpected to find more broken ground between the opposite bluffs, had\r\nlocal upthrows of alluvial strata been of repeated occurrence.\r\n\r\n_Antiquity of the delta._--The vast size of the alluvial plain both\r\nabove and below the head of the delta, or the branching off of the\r\nuppermost arm of the Atchafalaya, has been already alluded to. Its\r\nsuperficial dimensions, according to Mr. Forshey, exceed 30,000 square\r\nmiles, nearly half of which belong to the true delta. The deposits\r\nconsist partly of sand originally formed upon or near the banks of the\r\nriver, and its tributaries, partly of gravel, swept down the main\r\nchannel, of which the position has continually shifted, and partly of\r\nfine mud slowly accumulated in the swamps. The farther we descend the\r\nriver towards its mouth, the finer becomes the texture of the sediment.\r\nThe whole alluvial formation, from the base of the delta upwards, slopes\r\nwith a very gentle inclination, rising about three inches in a mile from\r\nthe level of the sea at the Balize, to the height of about 200 feet in a\r\ndistance of about 800 miles.\r\n\r\nThat a large portion of this fluviatile deposit, together with the\r\nfluvio-marine strata now in progress near the Balize, consists of mud\r\nand sand with much vegetable matter intermixed, may be inferred from\r\nwhat has been said of the abundance of drift trees floated down every\r\nsummer. These are seen matted together into a net-work around the\r\nextensive mud banks at the extreme mouths of the river. Every one\r\nacquainted with the geography of Louisiana is aware that the most\r\nsouthern part of the delta forms a long narrow tongue of land protruding\r\nfor 50 miles into the Gulf of Mexico, at the end of which are numerous\r\nchannels of discharge. This singular promontory consists simply of the\r\nriver and its two low, flat banks, covered with reeds, young willows,\r\nand poplars. Its appearance answers precisely to that of the banks far\r\nin the interior, when nothing appears above water during inundations but\r\nthe higher part of the sloping glacis or bank. In the one case we have\r\nthe swamps or an expanse of freshwater with the tops of trees appearing\r\nabove, in the other the bluish green surface of the Gulf of Mexico. An\r\nopinion has very commonly prevailed that this narrow promontory, the\r\nnewest product of the river, has gained very rapidly upon the sea, since\r\nthe foundation of New Orleans; but after visiting the Balize in 1846, in\r\ncompany with Dr. Carpenter, and making many inquiries of the pilots, and\r\ncomparing the present outline of the coast with the excellent Spanish\r\nchart, published by Charlevoix 120 years before, we came to a different\r\nconclusion. The rate of permanent advance of the new land has been very\r\nslow, not exceeding perhaps one mile in a century. The gain may have\r\nbeen somewhat more rapid in former years, when the new strip of soil\r\nprojected less far into the gulf, since it is now much more exposed to\r\nthe action of a strong marine current. The tides also, when the waters\r\nof the river are low, enter into each opening, and scour them out,\r\ndestroying the banks of mud and the sand-bars newly formed during the\r\nflood season.\r\n\r\nAn observation of Darby, in regard to the strata composing part of this\r\ndelta, deserves attention. In the steep banks of the Atchafalaya, before\r\nalluded to, the following section, he says, is observable at low\r\nwater:--first an upper stratum, consisting invariably of bluish clay,\r\ncommon to the banks of the Mississippi; below this a stratum of red\r\nochreous earth, peculiar to Red River, under which the blue clay of the\r\nMississippi again appears; and this arrangement is constant, proving, as\r\nthat geographer remarks, that the waters of the Mississippi and the Red\r\nRiver occupied alternately, at some former periods, considerable tracts\r\nbelow their present point of union.[366] Such alternations are probably\r\ncommon in submarine spaces situated between two converging deltas; for,\r\nbefore the two rivers unite, there must almost always be a certain\r\nperiod when an intermediate tract will by turns be occupied and\r\nabandoned by the waters of each stream; since it can rarely happen that\r\nthe season of highest flood will precisely correspond in each. In the\r\ncase of the Red River and Mississippi, which carry off the waters from\r\ncountries placed under widely distant latitudes, an exact coincidence in\r\nthe time of greatest inundation is very improbable.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of the delta, or length of the period which has been\r\noccupied in the deposition of so vast a mass of alluvial matter, is a\r\nquestion which may well excite the curiosity of every geologist.\r\nSufficient data have not yet been obtained to afford a full and\r\nsatisfactory answer to the inquiry, but some approximation may already\r\nbe made to the minimum of time required.\r\n\r\nWhen I visited New Orleans, in February, 1846, I found that Dr. Riddell\r\nhad made numerous experiments to ascertain the proportion of sediment\r\ncontained in the waters of the Mississippi; and he concluded that the\r\nmean annual amount of solid matter was to the water as 1/1245 in weight,\r\nor about 1/3000 in volume.[367] From the observations of the same\r\ngentleman, and those of Dr. Carpenter and Mr. Forshey, an eminent\r\nengineer, to whom I have before alluded, the average width, depth, and\r\nvelocity of the Mississippi, and thence the mean annual discharge of\r\nwater were deduced. I assumed 528 feet, or the tenth of a mile, as the\r\nprobable thickness of the deposit of mud and sand in the delta; founding\r\nmy conjecture chiefly on the depth of the Gulf of Mexico, between the\r\nsouthern point of Florida and the Balize, which equals on an average 100\r\nfathoms, and partly on some borings 600 feet deep in the delta, near\r\nLake Pontchartrain, north of New Orleans, in which the bottom of the\r\nalluvial matter is said not to have been reached. The area of the delta\r\nbeing about 13,600 square statute miles, and the quantity of solid\r\nmatter annually brought down by the river 3,702,758,400 cubic feet, it\r\nmust have taken 67,000 years for the formation of the whole; and if the\r\nalluvial matter of the plain above be 264 feet deep, or half that of the\r\ndelta,[368] it must have required 33,500 more years for its\r\naccumulation, even if its area be estimated as only equal to that of the\r\ndelta, whereas it is in fact larger. If some deduction be made from the\r\ntime here stated, in consequence of the effect of the drift-wood, which\r\nmust have aided in filling up more rapidly the space above alluded to, a\r\nfar more important allowance must be made on the other hand, for the\r\nloss of matter, owing to the finer particles of mud not settling at the\r\nmouths of the river, but being swept out far to sea during the\r\npredominant action of the tides, and the waves in the winter months,\r\nwhen the current of fresh water is feeble. Yet however vast the time\r\nduring which the Mississippi has been transporting its earthy burden to\r\nthe ocean, the whole period, though far exceeding, perhaps, 100,000\r\nyears, must be insignificant in a geological point of view, since the\r\nbluffs or cliffs, bounding the great valley, and therefore older in\r\ndate, and which are from 50 to 250 feet in perpendicular height, consist\r\nin great part of loam containing land, fluviatile, and lacustrine shells\r\nof species still inhabiting the same country. (See fig. 23, p. 265.)\r\n\r\nBefore we take leave of the great delta, we may derive an instructive\r\nlesson from the reflection that the new deposits already formed, or now\r\naccumulating, whether marine or freshwater, must greatly resemble in\r\ncomposition, and the general character of their organic remains, many\r\nancient strata, which enter largely into the earth's structure. Yet\r\nthere is no sudden revolution in progress, whether on the land or in the\r\nwaters, whether in the animate or the inanimate world. Notwithstanding\r\nthe excessive destruction of soil and uprooting of trees, the region\r\nwhich yields a never-failing supply of drift-wood is densely clothed\r\nwith noble forests, and is almost unrivalled in its power of supporting\r\nanimal and vegetable life. In spite of the undermining of many a lofty\r\nbluff, and the encroachments of the delta on the sea--in spite of the\r\nearthquake, which rends and fissures the soil, or causes areas more than\r\nsixty miles in length to sink down several yards in a few months, the\r\ngeneral features of the district remain unaltered, or are merely\r\nundergoing a slow and insensible change. Herds of wild deer graze on the\r\npastures, or browse upon the trees; and if they diminish in number, it\r\nis only where they give way to man and the domestic animals which follow\r\nin his train. The bear, the wolf, the fox, the panther, and the\r\nwild-cat, still maintain themselves in the fastnesses of the forests of\r\ncypress and gum-tree. The racoon and the opossum are everywhere\r\nabundant, while the musk-rat, otter, and mink still frequent the rivers\r\nand lakes, and a few beavers and buffaloes have not yet been driven from\r\ntheir ancient haunts. The waters teem with alligators, tortoises, and\r\nfish, and their surface is covered with millions of migratory waterfowl,\r\nwhich perform their annual voyage between the Canadian lakes and the\r\nshores of the Mexican Gulf. The power of man begins to be sensibly felt,\r\nand many parts of the wilderness to be replaced by towns, orchards, and\r\ngardens. The gilded steamboats, like moving palaces, stem the force of\r\nthe current, or shoot rapidly down the descending stream, through the\r\nsolitudes of the forests and prairies. Already does the flourishing\r\npopulation of the great valley far exceed that of the thirteen United\r\nStates when first they declared their independence. Such is the state of\r\na continent where trees and stones are hurried annually by a thousand\r\ntorrents, from the mountains to the plains, and where sand and finer\r\nmatter are swept down by a vast current to the sea, together with the\r\nwreck of countless forests and the bones of animals which perish in the\r\ninundations. When these materials reach the gulf, they do not render the\r\nwaters unfit for aquatic animals; but on the contrary, the ocean here\r\nswarms with life, as it generally does where the influx of a great river\r\nfurnishes a copious supply of organic and mineral matter. Yet many\r\ngeologists, when they behold the spoils of the land heaped in successive\r\nstrata, and blended confusedly with the remains of fishes, or\r\ninterspersed with broken shells and corals; when they see portions of\r\nerect trunks of trees with their roots still retaining their natural\r\nposition, and one tier of these preserved in a fossil state above\r\nanother, imagine that they are viewing the signs of a turbulent instead\r\nof a tranquil and settled state of the planet. They read in such\r\nphenomena the proof of chaotic disorder and reiterated catastrophes,\r\ninstead of indications of a surface as habitable as the most delicious\r\nand fertile districts now tenanted by man.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELTA OF THE GANGES AND BRAHMAPOOTRA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.\r\n\r\nMAP OF THE DELTA OF THE GANGES AND BRAHMAPOOTRA.]\r\n\r\nAs an example of a still larger delta advancing upon the sea in\r\nopposition to more powerful tides, I shall next describe that of the\r\nGanges and Brahmapootra (or Burrampooter). These, the two principal\r\nrivers of India, descend from the highest mountains in the world, and\r\npartially mingle their waters in the low plains of Hindostan, before\r\nreaching the head of the Bay of Bengal. The Brahmapootra, somewhat the\r\nlarger of the two, formerly passed to the east of Dacca, even so lately\r\nas the beginning of the present century, pouring most of its waters into\r\none of the numerous channels in the delta called \"the Megna.\" By that\r\nname the main stream was always spoken of by Rennell and others in their\r\nmemoirs on this region. But the main trunk now unites with an arm of the\r\nGanges considerably higher up, at a point about 100 miles distant from\r\nthe sea; and it is constantly, according to Dr. Hooker, working its way\r\nwestward, having formerly, as may be seen by ancient maps, moved\r\neastward for a long period.\r\n\r\nThe area of the delta of the combined rivers, for it is impossible now\r\nto distinguish what belongs to each, is considerably more than double\r\nthat of the Nile, even if we exclude from the delta a large extent of\r\nlow, flat, alluvial plain, doubtless of fluviatile origin, which\r\nstretches more than 100 miles to the hills west of Calcutta (see map,\r\nfig. 25), and much farther in a northerly direction beyond the head of\r\nthe great delta. The head of a delta is that point where the first arm\r\nis given off. Above that point a river receives the waters of\r\ntributaries flowing from higher levels; below it, on the contrary, it\r\ngives out portions of its waters to lower levels, through channels which\r\nflow into adjoining swamps, or which run directly to the sea. The\r\nMississippi, as before described, has a single head, which originated at\r\nan unknown period when the Red River joined it. In the great delta of\r\nBengal there may be said to be two heads nearly equidistant from the\r\nsea, that of the Ganges (G, map, fig. 25), about 30 miles below\r\nRajmahal, or 216 statute miles in a direct line from the sea, and that\r\nof the Brahmapootra (B), below Chirapoonjee, where the river issues from\r\nthe Khasia mountains, a distance of 224 miles from the Bay of Bengal.\r\n\r\nIt will appear, by reference to the map, that the great body of fresh\r\nwater derived from the two rivers enters the bay on its eastern side;\r\nand that a large part of the delta bordering on the sea is composed of a\r\nlabyrinth of rivers and creeks, all filled with salt water, except those\r\nimmediately communicating with the Hoogly, or principal arm of the\r\nGanges. This tract alone, known by the name of the Woods, or Sunderbunds\r\n(more properly Soonderbuns), a wilderness infested by tigers and\r\ncrocodiles, is, according to Rennell, equal in extent to the whole\r\nprincipality of Wales.[369]\r\n\r\nOn the sea-coast there are eight great openings, each of which has\r\nevidently, at some ancient period, served in its turn as the principal\r\nchannel of discharge. Although the flux and reflux of the tide extend\r\neven to the heads of the delta when the rivers are low, yet, when they\r\nare periodically swollen by tropical rains, their volume and velocity\r\ncounteract the tidal current, so that, except very near the sea, the ebb\r\nand flow become insensible. During the flood season, therefore, the\r\nGanges and Brahmapootra almost assume in their delta, the character of\r\nrivers entering an inland sea; the movements of the ocean being then\r\nsubordinate to the force of the rivers, and only slightly disturbing\r\ntheir operations. The great gain of the delta in height and area takes\r\nplace during the inundations; and, during other seasons of the year, the\r\nocean makes reprisals, scouring out the channels, and sometimes\r\ndevouring rich alluvial plains.\r\n\r\n_Islands formed and destroyed._--Major R. H. Colebrooke, in his account\r\nof the course of the Ganges, relates examples of the rapid filling up of\r\nsome of its branches, and the excavation of new channels, where the\r\nnumber of square miles of soil removed in a short time (the column of\r\nearth being 114 feet high) was truly astonishing. Forty square miles, or\r\n25,600 acres, are mentioned as having been carried away, in one place,\r\nin the course of a few years.[370] The immense transportation of earthy\r\nmatter by the Ganges and Brahmapootra is proved by the great magnitude\r\nof the islands formed in their channels during a period far short of\r\nthat of a man's life. Some of these, many miles in extent, have\r\noriginated in large sand-banks thrown up round the points at the angular\r\nturning of the rivers, and afterwards insulated by breaches of the\r\nstreams. Others, formed in the main channel, are caused by some\r\nobstruction at the bottom. A large tree, or a sunken boat, is sometimes\r\nsufficient to check the current, and cause a deposit of sand, which\r\naccumulates till it usurps a considerable portion of the channel. The\r\nriver then undermines its banks on each side, to supply the deficiency\r\nin its bed, and the island is afterwards raised by fresh deposits during\r\nevery flood. In the great gulf below Luckipour, formed by the united\r\nwaters of the Ganges and Megna, some of the islands, says Rennell, rival\r\nin size and fertility the Isle of Wight. While the river is forming new\r\nislands in one part, it is sweeping away old ones in others. Those newly\r\nformed are soon overrun with reeds, long grass, the Tamarix Indica, and\r\nother shrubs, forming impenetrable thickets, where the tiger, the\r\nrhinoceros, the buffalo, deer, and other wild animals, take shelter. It\r\nis easy, therefore, to perceive, that both animal and vegetable remains\r\nmay occasionally be precipitated into the flood, and become imbedded in\r\nthe sediment which subsides in the delta.\r\n\r\nThree or four species of crocodile, of two distinct sub-genera, abound\r\nin the Ganges, and its tributary and contiguous waters; and Mr. H. T.\r\nColebrooke informed me, that he had seen both forms in places far\r\ninland, many hundred miles from the sea. The Gangetic crocodile, or\r\nGavial (in correct orthography, Garial), is confined to the fresh water,\r\nliving exclusively on fish, but the commoner kinds, called Koomiah and\r\nMuggar, frequent both fresh and salt, being much larger and fiercer in\r\nsalt and brackish water.[371] These animals swarm in the brackish water\r\nalong the line of sand-banks, where the advance of the delta is most\r\nrapid. Hundreds of them are seen together in the creeks of the delta,\r\nor basking in the sun on the shoals without. They will attack men and\r\ncattle, destroying the natives when bathing, and tame and wild animals\r\nwhich come to drink. \"I have not unfrequently,\" says Mr. Colebrooke,\r\n\"been witness to the horrid spectacle of a floating corpse seized by a\r\ncrocodile with such avidity, that he half emerged above the water with\r\nhis prey in his mouth.\" The geologist will not fail to observe how\r\npeculiarly the habits and distribution of these saurians expose them to\r\nbecome imbedded in the horizontal strata of fine mud, which are annually\r\ndeposited over many hundred square miles in the Bay of Bengal. The\r\ninhabitants of the land, which happen to be drowned or thrown into the\r\nwater, are usually devoured by these voracious reptiles; but we may\r\nsuppose the remains of the saurians themselves to be continually\r\nentombed in the new formations. The number, also, of bodies of the\r\npoorer class of Hindoos thrown annually into the Ganges is so great,\r\nthat some of their bones or skeletons can hardly fail to be occasionally\r\nenveloped in fluviatile mud.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens, at the season when the periodical flood is at its\r\nheight, that a strong gale of wind, conspiring with a high spring-tide,\r\nchecks the descending current of the river, and gives rise to most\r\ndestructive inundations. From this cause, in 1763, the waters at\r\nLuckipour rose six feet above their ordinary level, and the inhabitants\r\nof a considerable district, with their houses and cattle, were totally\r\nswept away.\r\n\r\nThe population of all oceanic deltas are particularly exposed to suffer\r\nby such catastrophes, recurring at considerable intervals of time; and\r\nwe may safely assume that such tragical events have happened again and\r\nagain since the Gangetic delta was inhabited by man. If human experience\r\nand forethought cannot always guard against these calamities, still less\r\ncan the inferior animals avoid them; and the monuments of such\r\ndisastrous inundations must be looked for in great abundance in strata\r\nof all ages, if the surface of our planet has always been governed by\r\nthe same laws. When we reflect on the general order and tranquillity\r\nthat reigns in the rich and populous delta of Bengal, notwithstanding\r\nthe havoc occasionally committed by the depredations of the ocean, we\r\nperceive how unnecessary it is to attribute the imbedding of successive\r\nraces of animals in older strata to extraordinary energy in the causes\r\nof decay and reproduction in the infancy of our planet, or to those\r\ngeneral catastrophes and sudden revolutions so often resorted to.\r\n\r\n_Deposits in the delta._--The quantity of mud held in suspension by the\r\nwaters of the Ganges and Brahmapootra is found, as might be expected, to\r\nexceed that of any of the rivers alluded to in this or the preceding\r\nchapters; for, in the first place, their feeders flow from mountains of\r\nunrivalled altitude, and do not clear themselves in any lakes, as does\r\nthe Rhine in the Lake of Constance, or the Rhone in that of Geneva. And,\r\nsecondly, their whole course is nearer the equator than that of the\r\nMississippi, or any great river, respecting which careful experiments\r\nhave been made, to determine the quantity of its water and earthy\r\ncontents. The fall of rain, moreover, as we have before seen, is\r\nexcessive on the southern flanks of the first range of mountains which\r\nrise from the plains of Hindostan, and still more remarkable is the\r\nquantity sometimes poured down in one day. (See above, p. 200.) The sea,\r\nwhere the Ganges and Brahmapootra discharge their main stream at the\r\nflood season, only recovers its transparency at the distance of from 60\r\nto 100 miles from the delta; and we may take for granted that the\r\ncurrent continues to transport the finer particles much farther south\r\nthan where the surface water first becomes clear. The general slope,\r\ntherefore, of the new strata must be extremely gentle. According to the\r\nbest charts, there is a gradual deepening from four to about sixty\r\nfathoms, as we proceed from the base of the delta to the distance of\r\nabout one hundred miles into the Bay of Bengal. At some few points\r\nseventy, or even one hundred, fathoms are obtained at that distance.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable exception, however, occurs to the regularity of the shape\r\nof the bottom. Opposite the middle of the delta, at the distance of\r\nthirty or forty miles from the coast, a deep submarine valley occurs,\r\ncalled the \"swatch of no ground,\" about fifteen miles in diameter, where\r\nsoundings of 180, and even 300, fathoms fail to reach the bottom. (See\r\nmap, p. 275.) This phenomenon is the more extraordinary, since the\r\ndepression runs north to within five miles of the line of shoals; and\r\nnot only do the waters charged with sediment pass over it continually,\r\nbut, during the monsoons, the sea, loaded with mud and sand, is beaten\r\nback in that direction towards the delta. As the mud is known to extend\r\nfor eighty miles farther into the gulf, an enormous thickness of matter\r\nmust have been deposited in \"the swatch.\" We may conclude, therefore,\r\neither that the original depth of this part of the Bay of Bengal was\r\nexcessive, or that subsidences have occurred in modern times. The latter\r\nconjecture is the less improbable, as the whole area of the delta has\r\nbeen convulsed in the historical era by earthquakes, and actual\r\nsubsidences have taken place in the neighboring coast of Chittagong,\r\nwhile \"the swatch\" lies not far from the volcanic band which connects\r\nSumatra, Barren Island, and Ramree.[372]\r\n\r\nOpposite the mouth of the Hoogly river, and immediately south of Saugor\r\nIsland, four miles from the nearest land of the delta, a new islet was\r\nformed about twenty years ago, called Edmonstone Island, on the centre\r\nof which a beacon was erected as a landmark in 1817. In 1818 the island\r\nhad become two miles long and half a mile broad, and was covered with\r\nvegetation and shrubs. Some houses were then built upon it, and in 1820\r\nit was used as a pilot station. The severe gale of 1823 divided it into\r\ntwo parts, and so reduced its size as to leave the beacon standing out\r\nin the sea, where, after remaining seven years, it was washed away. The\r\nislet in 1836 had been converted by successive storms into a sand-bank,\r\nhalf a mile long, on which a sea-mark was placed.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is evidence of gain at some points, the general progress\r\nof the coast is very slow; for the tides, when the river water is low,\r\nare actively employed in removing alluvial matter. In the Sunderbunds\r\nthe usual rise and fall of the tides is no more than eight feet, but, on\r\nthe east side of the delta, Dr. Hooker observed, in the winter of 1851,\r\na rise of from sixty to eighty feet, producing among the islands at the\r\nmouths of the Megna and Fenny rivers, a lofty wave or \"bore\" as they\r\nascend, and causing the river water to be ponded back, and then to sweep\r\ndown with great violence when the tide ebbs. The bay for forty miles\r\nsouth of Chittagong is so fresh that neither algae nor mangroves will\r\ngrow in it. We may, therefore, conceive how effective may be the current\r\nformed by so great a volume of water in dispersing fine mud over a wide\r\narea. Its power is sometimes augmented by the agitation of the bay\r\nduring hurricanes in the month of May. The new superficial strata\r\nconsists entirely of fine sand and mud; such, at least, are the only\r\nmaterials which are exposed to view in regular beds on the banks of the\r\nnumerous creeks. Neither here or higher up the Ganges, could Dr. Hooker\r\ndiscover any land or freshwater shells in sections of the banks, which\r\nin the plains higher up sometimes form cliffs eighty feet in height at\r\nlow water. In like manner I have stated[373] that I was unable to find\r\nany buried shells in the delta or modern river cliffs of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nNo substance so coarse as gravel occurs in any part of the delta of the\r\nGanges and Brahmapootra, nor nearer the sea than 400 miles. Yet it is\r\nremarkable that the boring of an Artesian well at Fort William, near\r\nCalcutta, in the years 1835-1840, displayed, at the depth of 120 feet,\r\nclay and sand with pebbles. This boring was carried to a depth of 481\r\nfeet below the level of Calcutta, and the geological section obtained in\r\nthe operation has been recorded with great care. Under the surface soil,\r\nat a depth of about ten feet, they came to a stiff blue clay about forty\r\nfeet in thickness; below which was sandy clay, containing in its lower\r\nportion abundance of decayed vegetable matter, which at the bottom\r\nassumed the character of a stratum of black peat two feet thick. This\r\npeaty mass was considered as a clear indication (like the \"dirt-bed\" of\r\nPortland) of an ancient terrestrial surface, with a forest or Sunderbund\r\nvegetation. Logs and branches of a red-colored wood occur both above and\r\nimmediately below the peat, so little altered that Dr. Wallich was able\r\nto identify them with the Soondri tree, _Heritiera littoralis_, one of\r\nthe most prevalent forms, at the base of the delta. Dr. Falconer tells\r\nme that similar peat has been met with at other points round Calcutta at\r\nthe depth of nine feet and twenty-five feet. It appears, therefore, that\r\nthere has been a sinking down of what was originally land in this\r\nregion, to the amount of seventy feet or more perpendicular; for\r\nCalcutta is only a few feet above the level of the sea, and the\r\nsuccessive peat-beds seem to imply that the subsidence of the ground was\r\ngradual or interrupted by several pauses. Below the vegetable mass they\r\nentered upon a stratum of yellowish clay about ten feet thick,\r\ncontaining horizontal layers of kunkar (or kankar), a nodular,\r\nconcretionary, argillaceous limestone, met with abundantly at greater or\r\nless depths in all parts of the valley of the Ganges, over many\r\nthousand square miles, and always presenting the same characters, even\r\nat a distance of one thousand miles north of Calcutta. Some of this\r\nkunkar is said to be of very recent origin in deposits formed by river\r\ninundations near Saharanpoor. After penetrating 120 feet, they found\r\nloam containing water-worn fragments of mica-slate and other kinds of\r\nrock, which the current of the Ganges can no longer transport to this\r\nregion. In the various beds pierced through below, consisting of clay,\r\nmarl, and friable sandstone, with kunkar here and there intermixed, no\r\norganic remains of decidedly marine origin were met with. Too positive a\r\nconclusion ought not, it is true, to be drawn from such a fact, when we\r\nconsider the narrow bore of the auger and its effect in crushing shells\r\nand bones. Nevertheless, it is worthy of remark, that the only fossils\r\nobtained in a recognizable state were of a fluviatile or terrestrial\r\ncharacter. Thus, at the depth of 350 feet, the bony shell of a tortoise,\r\nor trionyx, a freshwater genus, was found in sand, resembling the living\r\nspecies of Bengal. From the same stratum, also, they drew up the lower\r\nhalf of the humerus of a ruminant, at first referred to a hyaena. It was\r\nthe size and shape, says Dr. Falconer, of the shoulder-bone of the\r\n_Cervus porcinus_, or common hog-deer, of India. At the depth of 380\r\nfeet, clay with fragments of lacustrine shells was incumbent on what\r\nappears clearly to have been another \"dirt-bed,\" or stratum of decayed\r\nwood, implying a period of repose of some duration, and a forest-covered\r\nland, which must have subsided 300 feet, to admit of the subsequent\r\nsuperposition of the overlying deposits. It has been conjectured that,\r\nat the time when this area supported trees, the land extended much\r\nfarther out into the Bay of Bengal than now, and that in later times the\r\nGanges, while enlarging its delta, has been only recovering lost ground\r\nfrom the sea.\r\n\r\nAt the depth of about 400 feet below the surface, an abrupt change was\r\nobserved in the character of the strata, which were composed in great\r\npart of sand, shingle, and boulders, the only fossils observed being the\r\nvertebrae of a crocodile, shell of a trionyx, and fragments of wood very\r\nlittle altered, and similar to that buried in beds far above. These\r\ngravelly beds constituted the bottom of the section at the depth of 481\r\nfeet, when the operations were discontinued, in consequence of an\r\naccident which happened to the auger.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of pebbles at the depths of 120 and 400 feet implies an\r\nimportant change in the geographical condition of the region around or\r\nnear Calcutta. The fall of the river, or the general slope of the\r\nalluvial plain may have been formerly greater; or, before a general and\r\nperhaps unequal subsidence, hills once nearer the present base of the\r\ndelta may have risen several hundred feet, forming islands in the bay,\r\nwhich may have sunk gradually, and become buried under fluviatile\r\nsediment.\r\n\r\n_Antiquity of the delta._--It would be a matter of no small scientific\r\ninterest, if experiments were made to enable us to determine, with some\r\ndegree of accuracy, the mean quantity of earthy matter discharged\r\nannually into the sea by the united waters of the Ganges and\r\nBrahmapootra. The Rev. Mr. Everest instituted, in 1831-2, a series of\r\nobservations on the earthy matter brought down by the Ganges, at\r\nGhazepoor, 500 miles from the sea. He found that, in 1831, the number of\r\ncubic feet of water discharged by the river per second at that place\r\nwas, during the\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rains (4 months)        494,208\r\n  Winter (5 months)        71,200\r\n  Hot weather (3 months)   36,330\r\n\r\n\r\nso that we may state in round numbers that 500,000 cubic feet per second\r\nflow down during the four months of the flood season, from June to\r\nSeptember, and less than 60,000 per second during the remaining eight\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe average quantity of solid matter suspended in the water during the\r\nrains was, by weight, 1/428th part; but as the water is about one-half\r\nthe specific gravity of the dried mud, the solid matter discharged is\r\n1/856th part in bulk, or 577 cubic feet per second. This gives a total\r\nof 6,082,041,600 cubic feet for the discharge in the 122 days of the\r\nrain. The proportion of sediment in the waters at other seasons was\r\ncomparatively insignificant, the total amount during the five winter\r\nmonths being only 247,881,600 cubic feet, and during the three months of\r\nhot weather 38,154,240 cubic feet. The total annual discharge, then,\r\nwould be 6,368,077,440 cubic feet.\r\n\r\nThis quantity of mud would in one year raise a surface of 228-1/2 square\r\nmiles, or a square space, each side of which should measure 15 miles, a\r\nheight of one foot. To give some idea of the magnitude of this result,\r\nwe will assume that the specific gravity of the dried mud is only\r\none-half that of granite (it would, however, be more); in that case, the\r\nearthy matter discharged in a year would equal 3,184,038,720 cubic feet\r\nof granite. Now about 12-1/2 cubic feet of granite weigh one ton; and it\r\nis computed that the great Pyramid of Egypt, if it were a solid mass of\r\ngranite, would weigh about 600,000,000 tons. The mass of matter,\r\ntherefore, carried down annually would, according to this estimate, more\r\nthan equal in weight and bulk forty-two of the great pyramids of Egypt,\r\nand that borne down in the four months of the rains would equal forty\r\npyramids. But if, without any conjecture as to what may have been the\r\nspecific gravity of the mud, we attend merely to the weight of solid\r\nmatter actually proved by Mr. Everest to have been contained in the\r\nwater, we find that the number of tons weight which passed down in the\r\n122 days of the rainy season was 339,413,760, which would give the\r\nweight of fifty-six pyramids and a half; and in the whole year\r\n355,361,464 tons, or nearly the weight of sixty pyramids.\r\n\r\nThe base of the great Pyramid of Egypt covers eleven acres, and its\r\nperpendicular height is about five hundred feet. It is scarcely possible\r\nto present any picture to the mind which will convey an adequate\r\nconception of the mighty scale of this operation, so tranquilly and\r\nalmost insensibly carried on by the Ganges, as it glides through its\r\nalluvial plain, even at a distance of 500 miles from the sea. It may,\r\nhowever, be stated, that if a fleet of more than eighty Indiamen, each\r\nfreighted with about 1400 tons' weight of mud, were to sail down the\r\nriver every hour of every day and night for four months continuously,\r\nthey would only transport from the higher country to the sea a mass of\r\nsolid matter equal to that borne down by the Ganges, even in this part\r\nof its course, in the four months of the flood season. Or the exertions\r\nof a fleet of about 2000 such ships going down daily with the same\r\nburden, and discharging it into the gulf, would be no more than\r\nequivalent to the operations of the great river.\r\n\r\nThe most voluminous current of lava which has flowed from Etna within\r\nhistorical times was that of 1669. Ferrara, after correcting Borelli's\r\nestimate, calculated the quantity of cubic yards of lava in this current\r\nat 140,000,000. Now, this would not equal in bulk one-fifth of the\r\nsedimentary matter which is carried down in a single year by the Ganges,\r\npast Ghazepoor, according to the estimate above explained; so that it\r\nwould require five grand eruptions of Etna to transfer a mass of lava\r\nfrom the subterranean regions to the surface, equal in volume to the mud\r\ncarried down in one year to that place.\r\n\r\nCaptain R. Strachey, of the Bengal Engineers, has remarked to me, not\r\nonly that Ghazepoor, where Mr. Everest's observations were made, is 500\r\nmiles from the sea, but that the Ganges has not been joined there by its\r\nmost important feeders. These drain upon the whole 750 miles of the\r\nHimalaya, and no more than 150 miles of that mountain-chain have sent\r\ntheir contributions to the main trunk at Ghazepoor. Below that place,\r\nthe Ganges is joined by the Gogra, Gunduk, Khosee, and Teesta from the\r\nnorth, to say nothing of the Sone flowing from the south, one of the\r\nlargest of the rivers which rise in the table-land of central India.\r\n(See map, fig. 25, p. 275.) Moreover the remaining 600 miles of the\r\nHimalaya comprise that eastern portion of the basin where the rains are\r\nheaviest. (See above, p. 200.) The quantity of water therefore carried\r\ndown to the sea may probably be four or five times as much as that which\r\npasses Ghazepoor.\r\n\r\nThe Brahmapootra, according to Major Wilcox,[374] in the month of\r\nJanuary, when it is near its minimum, discharges 150,000 cubic feet of\r\nwater per second at Gwalpara, not many miles above the head of its\r\ndelta. Taking the proportions observed at Ghazepoor at the different\r\nseasons as a guide, the probable average discharge of the Brahmapootra\r\nfor the whole year may be estimated at about the same as that of the\r\nGanges. Assuming this; and secondly, in order to avoid the risk of\r\nexaggeration, that the proportion of sediment in their waters is about a\r\nthird less than Mr. Everest's estimate, the mud borne down to the Bay of\r\nBengal in one year would equal 40,000 millions of cubic feet, or between\r\nsix and seven times as much as that brought down to Ghazepoor, according\r\nto Mr. Everest's calculations in 1831, and ten times as much as that\r\nconveyed annually by the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nCaptain Strachey estimates the annually inundated portion of the delta\r\nat 250 miles in length by 80 in breadth, making an area of 20,000 square\r\nmiles. The space south of this in the bay, where sediment is thrown\r\ndown, may be 300 miles from E. to W. by 150 N. and S., or 45,000 square\r\nmiles, which, added to the former, gives a surface of 65,000 square\r\nmiles, over which the sediment is spread out by the two rivers. Suppose\r\nthen the solid matter to amount to 40,000 millions of cubic feet per\r\nannum, the deposit, he observes, must be continued for forty-five years\r\nand three-tenths to raise the whole area a height of one foot, or 13,600\r\nyears to raise it 300 feet; and this, as we have seen, is much less than\r\nthe thickness of the fluviatile strata actually penetrated, (and the\r\nbottom not reached) by the auger at Calcutta.\r\n\r\nNevertheless we can by no means deduce from these data alone, what will\r\nbe the future rate of advance of the delta, nor even predict whether the\r\nland will gain on the sea, or remain stationary. At the end of 13,000\r\nyears the bay may be less shallow than now, provided a moderate\r\ndepression, corresponding to that experienced in part of Greenland for\r\nmany centuries shall take place (see chap. 30). A subsidence quite\r\ninsensible to the inhabitants of Bengal, not exceeding two feet three\r\ninches in a century, would be more than sufficient to counterbalance all\r\nthe efforts of the two mighty rivers to extend the limits of their\r\ndelta. We have seen that the Artesian borings at Calcutta attest, what\r\nthe vast depth of the \"swatch\" may also in all likelihood indicate, that\r\nthe antagonist force of subsidence has predominated for ages over the\r\ninflux of fluviatile mud, preventing it from raising the plains of\r\nBengal, or from filling up a larger portion of the bay.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING REMARKS ON DELTAS.\r\n\r\n_Convergence of deltas._--If we possessed an accurate series of maps of\r\nthe Adriatic for many thousand years, our retrospect would, without\r\ndoubt, carry us gradually back to the time when the number of rivers\r\ndescending from the mountains into that gulf by independent deltas was\r\nfar greater in number. The deltas of the Po and the Adige, for instance,\r\nwould separate themselves within the _recent_ era, as, in all\r\nprobability, would those of the Isonzo and the Torre. If, on the other\r\nhand, we speculate on future changes, we may anticipate the period when\r\nthe number of deltas will greatly diminish; for the Po cannot continue\r\nto encroach at the rate of a mile in a hundred years, and other rivers\r\nto gain as much in six or seven centuries upon the shallow gulf, without\r\nnew junctions occurring from time to time; so that Eridanus, \"the king\r\nof rivers,\" will continually boast a greater number of tributaries. The\r\nGanges and the Brahmapootra have perhaps become partially confluent in\r\nthe same delta within the historical, or at least within the human era;\r\nand the date of the junction of the Red River and the Mississippi would,\r\nin all likelihood, have been known, if America had not been so recently\r\ndiscovered. The union of the Tigris and the Euphrates must undoubtedly\r\nhave been one of the modern geographical changes of our Earth, for Col.\r\nRawlinson informs me that the delta of those rivers has advanced two\r\nmiles in the last sixty years, and is supposed to have encroached about\r\nforty miles upon the Gulf of Persia in the course of the last\r\ntwenty-five centuries.\r\n\r\nWhen the deltas of rivers, having many mouths, converge, a partial union\r\nat first takes place by the confluence of some one or more of their\r\narms; but it is not until the main trunks are connected above the head\r\nof the common delta, that a complete intermixture of their joint waters\r\nand sediment takes place. The union, therefore, of the Po and Adige, and\r\nof the Ganges and Brahmapootra, is still incomplete. If we reflect on\r\nthe geographical extent of surface drained by rivers such as now enter\r\nthe Bay of Bengal, and then consider how complete the blending together\r\nof the greater part of their transported matter has already become, and\r\nthroughout how vast a delta it is spread by numerous arms, we no longer\r\nfeel so much surprise at the area occupied by some ancient formations of\r\nhomogeneous mineral composition. But our surprise will be still farther\r\nlessened, when we afterwards inquire (ch. 21) into the action of tides\r\nand currents in disseminating sediment.\r\n\r\n_Age of existing deltas._--If we could take for granted, that the\r\nrelative level of land and sea had remained stationary ever since all\r\nthe existing deltas began to be formed--could we assume that their\r\ngrowth commenced at one and the same instant when the present continents\r\nacquired their actual shape--we might understand the language of\r\ngeologists who speak of \"the epoch of existing continents.\" They\r\nendeavor to calculate the age of deltas from this imaginary fixed\r\nperiod; and they calculate the gain of new land upon the sea, at the\r\nmouths of rivers, as having begun everywhere simultaneously. But the\r\nmore we study the history of deltas, the more we become convinced that\r\nupward and downward movements of the land and contiguous bed of the sea\r\nhave exerted, and continue to exert, an influence on the physical\r\ngeography of many hydrographical basins, on a scale comparable in\r\nmagnitude or importance to the amount of fluviatile deposition effected\r\nin an equal lapse of time. In the basin of the Mississippi, for example,\r\nproofs both of descending and ascending movements to a vertical amount\r\nof several hundred feet can be shown to have taken place since the\r\nexisting species of land and freshwater shells lived in that\r\nregion.[375]\r\n\r\nThe deltas also of the Po and Ganges have each, as we have seen (p.\r\n257), when probed by the Artesian auger, borne testimony to a gradual\r\nsubsidence of land to the extent of several hundred feet--old\r\nterrestrial surfaces, turf, peat, forest-land, and \"dirt-beds,\" having\r\nbeen pierced at various depths. The changes of level at the mouth of the\r\nIndus in Cutch (see below, chap. 27), and those of New Madrid in the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi (see p. 270, and chap. 27), are equally\r\ninstructive, as demonstrating unceasing fluctuations in the levels of\r\nthose areas into which running water is transporting sediment. If,\r\ntherefore, the exact age of all modern deltas could be known, it is\r\nscarcely probable that we should find any two of them in the world to\r\nhave coincided in date, or in the time when their earliest deposits\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\n_Grouping of strata in deltas._--The changes which have taken place in\r\ndeltas, even within the times of history, may suggest many important\r\nconsiderations in regard to the manner in which subaqueous sediment is\r\ndistributed. With the exception of some cases hereafter to be noticed,\r\nthere are some general laws of arrangement which must evidently hold\r\ngood in almost all the lakes and seas now filling up. If a lake, for\r\nexample, be encircled on two sides by lofty mountains, receiving from\r\nthem many rivers and torrents of different sizes, and if it be bounded\r\non the other sides, where the surplus waters issue, by a comparatively\r\nlow country, it is not difficult to define some of the leading\r\ngeological features which must characterize the lacustrine formation,\r\nwhen this basin shall have been gradually converted into dry land by the\r\ninflux of sediment. The strata would be divisible into two principal\r\ngroups: the _older_ comprising those deposits which originated on the\r\nside adjoining the mountains, where numerous deltas first began to form;\r\nand the _newer_ group consisting of beds deposited in the more central\r\nparts of the basin, and towards the side farthest from the mountains.\r\nThe following characters would form the principal marks of distinction\r\nbetween the strata in each series:--The more ancient system would be\r\ncomposed, for the most part, of coarser materials, containing many beds\r\nof pebbles and sand, often of great thickness, and sometimes dipping at\r\na considerable angle. These, with associated beds of finer ingredients,\r\nwould, if traced round the borders of the basin, be seen to vary greatly\r\nin color and mineral composition, and would also be very irregular in\r\nthickness. The beds, on the contrary, in the newer group, would consist\r\nof finer particles, and would be horizontal, or very slightly inclined.\r\nTheir color and mineral composition would be very homogeneous throughout\r\nlarge areas, and would differ from almost all the separate beds in the\r\nolder series.\r\n\r\nThe following causes would produce the diversity here alluded to between\r\nthe two great members of such lacustrine formations:--When the rivers\r\nand torrents first reach the edge of the lake, the detritus washed down\r\nby them from the adjoining heights sinks at once into deep water, all\r\nthe heavier pebbles and sand subsiding near the shore. The finer mud is\r\ncarried somewhat farther out, but not to the distance of many miles, for\r\nthe greater part may be seen, as, for example, where the Rhone enters\r\nthe Lake of Geneva, to fall down in clouds to the bottom, not far from\r\nthe river's mouth. Thus alluvial tracts are soon formed at the mouths of\r\nevery torrent and river, and many of these in the course of ages become\r\nof considerable extent. Pebbles and sand are then transported farther\r\nfrom the mountains; but in their passage they decrease in size by\r\nattrition, and are in part converted into mud and sand. At length some\r\nof the numerous deltas, which are all directed towards a common centre,\r\napproach near to each other; those of adjoining torrents become united,\r\nand each is merged, in its turn, in the delta of the largest river,\r\nwhich advances most rapidly into the lake, and renders all the minor\r\nstreams, one after the other, its tributaries. The various mineral\r\ningredients of all are thus blended together into one homogeneous\r\nmixture, and the sediment is poured out from a common channel into the\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nAs the average size of the transported particles decreases, while the\r\nforce and volume of the main river augments, the newer deposits are\r\ndiffused continually over a wider area, and are consequently more\r\nhorizontal than the older. When at first there were many independent\r\ndeltas near the borders of the basin, their separate deposits differed\r\nentirely from each other; one may have been charged, like the Arve where\r\nit joins the Rhone, with white sand and sediment derived from\r\ngranite--another may have been black, like many streams in the Tyrol,\r\nflowing from the waste of decomposing rocks of dark slate--a third may\r\nhave been colored by ochreous sediment, like the Red River in\r\nLouisiana--a fourth, like the Elsa in Tuscany, may have held much\r\ncarbonate of lime in solution. At first they would each form distinct\r\ndeposits of sand, gravel, limestone, marl, or other materials; but,\r\nafter their junction, new chemical combinations and a distinct color\r\nwould be the result, and the particles, having been conveyed ten,\r\ntwenty, or a greater number of miles over alluvial plains, would become\r\nfiner.\r\n\r\nIn those deltas where the tides and strong marine currents interfere,\r\nthe above description would only be applicable, with certain\r\nmodifications. If a series of earthquakes accompany the growth of a\r\ndelta, and change the levels of the land from time to time, as in the\r\nregion where the Indus now enters the sea, the phenomena will depart\r\nstill more widely from the ordinary type. If, after a protracted period\r\nof rest, a delta sinks down, pebbles may be borne along in shallow water\r\nnear the foot of the boundary hills, so as to form conglomerates\r\noverlying the fine mud previously thrown into deeper water in the same\r\narea.\r\n\r\n_Causes of stratification in deltas._--The stratified arrangement, which\r\nis observed to prevail so generally in aqueous deposits, is most\r\nfrequently due to variations in the velocity of running water, which\r\ncannot sweep along particles of more than a certain size and weight when\r\nmoving at a given rate. Hence, as the force of the stream augments or\r\ndecreases, the materials thrown down in successive layers at particular\r\nplaces are rudely sorted, according to their dimensions, form, and\r\nspecific gravity. Where this cause has not operated, as where sand, mud,\r\nand fragments of rock are conveyed by a glacier, a confused heap of\r\nrubbish devoid of all stratification is produced.\r\n\r\nNatural divisions are also occasioned in deltas, by the interval of time\r\nwhich separates annually the deposition of matter during the periodical\r\nrains, or melting of snow upon the mountains. The deposit of each year\r\nmay acquire some degree of consistency before that of the succeeding\r\nyear is superimposed. A variety of circumstances also give rise\r\nannually, or sometimes from day to day, to slight variations in color,\r\nfineness of the particles, and other characters, by which alternations\r\nof strata distinct in texture and mineral ingredients must be produced.\r\nThus, for example, at one period of the year, drift-wood may be carried\r\ndown, and, at another, mud, as was before stated to be the case in the\r\ndelta of the Mississippi; or at one time, when the volume and velocity\r\nof the stream are greatest, pebbles and sand may be spread over a\r\ncertain area, over which, when the waters are low, fine matter or\r\nchemical precipitates are formed. During inundations, the turbid current\r\nof fresh water often repels the sea for many miles; but when the river\r\nis low, salt water again occupies the same space. When two deltas are\r\nconverging, the intermediate space is often, for reasons before\r\nexplained, alternately the receptacle of different sediments derived\r\nfrom the converging streams (see p. 272). The one is, perhaps, charged\r\nwith calcareous, the other with argillaceous matter; or one sweeps down\r\nsand and pebbles, the other impalpable mud. These differences may be\r\nrepeated with considerable regularity, until a thickness of hundreds of\r\nfeet of alternating beds is accumulated. The multiplication, also, of\r\nshells and corals in particular spots, and for limited periods, gives\r\nrise occasionally to lines of separation, and divides a mass which might\r\notherwise be homogeneous into distinct strata.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the shell marl now forming in the Scotch lakes, or the\r\nsediment termed \"warp,\" which subsides from the muddy water of the\r\nHumber and other rivers, shows that recent deposits are often composed\r\nof a great number of extremely thin layers, either even or slightly\r\nundulating, and preserving a general parallelism to the planes of\r\nstratification. Sometimes, however, the laminae in modern strata are\r\ndisposed diagonally at a considerable angle, which appears to take place\r\nwhere there are conflicting movements in the waters. In January, 1829, I\r\nvisited, in company with Professor L. A. Necker, of Geneva, the\r\nconfluence of the Rhone and Arve, when those rivers were very low, and\r\nwere cutting channels through the vast heaps of dabris thrown down from\r\nthe waters of the Arve in the preceding spring. One of the sandbanks\r\nwhich had formed, in the spring of 1828, where the opposing currents of\r\nthe two rivers neutralized each other, and caused a retardation in the\r\nmotion, had been undermined; and the following is an exact\r\nrepresentation of the arrangement of laminae exposed in a vertical\r\nsection. The length of the portion here seen is about twelve feet, and\r\nthe height five. The strata A A consist of irregular alternations of\r\npebbles and sand in undulating beds: below these are seams of very fine\r\nsand B B, some as thin as paper, others about a quarter of an inch\r\nthick. The strata C C are composed of layers of fine greenish-gray sand\r\nas thin as paper. Some of the inclined beds will be seen to be thicker\r\nat their upper, others at their lower extremity, the inclination of some\r\nbeing very considerable. These layers must have accumulated one on the\r\nother by lateral apposition, probably when one of the rivers was very\r\ngradually increasing or diminishing in velocity, so that the point of\r\ngreatest retardation caused by their conflicting currents shifted\r\nslowly, allowing the sediment to be thrown down in successive layers on\r\na sloping bank. The same phenomenon is exhibited in older strata of all\r\nages.[376]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.\r\n\r\nSection of a sand-bank in the bed of the Arve at its confluence with the\r\nRhone, showing the stratification of deposits where currents meet.]\r\n\r\nIf the bed of a lake or of the sea be sinking, whether at a uniform or\r\nan unequal rate, or oscillating in level during the deposition of\r\nsediment, these movements will give rise to a different class of\r\nphenomena, as, for example, to repeated alternations of shallow-water\r\nand deep-water deposits, each with peculiar organic remains, or to\r\nfrequent repetitions of similar beds, formed at a uniform depth, and\r\ninclosing the same organic remains, and to other results too complicated\r\nand varied to admit of enumeration here.\r\n\r\n_Formation of conglomerates._--Along the base of the Maritime Alps,\r\nbetween Toulon and Genoa, the rivers, with few exceptions, are now\r\nforming strata of conglomerate and sand. Their channels are often\r\nseveral miles in breadth, some of them being dry, and the rest easily\r\nforded for nearly eight months in the year, whereas during the melting\r\nof the snow they are swollen, and a great transportation of mud and\r\npebbles takes place. In order to keep open the main road from France to\r\nItaly, now carried along the sea-coast, it is necessary to remove\r\nannually great masses of shingle brought down during the flood season. A\r\nportion of the pebbles are seen in some localities, as near Nice, to\r\nform beds of shingle along the shore, but the greater part are swept\r\ninto a deep sea. The small progress made by the deltas of minor rivers\r\non this coast need not surprise us, when we recollect that there is\r\nsometimes a depth of two thousand feet at a few hundred yards from the\r\nbeach, as near Nice. Similar observations might be made respecting a\r\nlarge proportion of the rivers in Sicily, and among others, respecting\r\nthat which, immediately north of the port of Messina, hurries annually\r\nvast masses of granitic pebbles into the sea.\r\n\r\n_Constant interchange of land and sea._--I may here conclude my remarks\r\non deltas, observing that, imperfect as is our information of the\r\nchanges which they have undergone within the last three thousand years,\r\nthey are sufficient to show how constant an interchange of sea and land\r\nis taking place on the face of our globe. In the Mediterranean alone,\r\nmany flourishing inland towns, and a still greater number of ports, now\r\nstand where the sea rolled its waves since the era of the early\r\ncivilization of Europe. If we could compare with equal accuracy the\r\nancient and actual state of all the islands and continents, we should\r\nprobably discover that millions of our race are now supported by lands\r\nsituated where deep seas prevailed in earlier ages. In many districts\r\nnot yet occupied by man, land animals and forests now abound where ships\r\nonce sailed; and, on the other hand, we shall find, on inquiry, that\r\ninroads of the ocean have been no less considerable. When to these\r\nrevolutions, produced by aqueous causes, we add analogous changes\r\nwrought by igneous agency, we shall, perhaps, acknowledge the justice of\r\nthe conclusion of Aristotle, who declared that the whole land and sea on\r\nour globe periodically changed places.[377]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nDESTROYING AND TRANSPORTING EFFECTS OF TIDES AND CURRENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Difference in the rise of tides--Lagullas and Gulf\r\n    currents--Velocity of currents--Causes of currents--Action of the\r\n    sea on the British coast--Shetland Islands--Large blocks\r\n    removed--Isles reduced to clusters of rocks--Orkney isles--Waste of\r\n    East coast of Scotland--and East coast of England--Waste of the\r\n    cliffs of Holderness, Norfolk, and Suffolk--Sand-dunes, how far\r\n    chronometers--Silting up of estuaries--Yarmouth estuary--Suffolk\r\n    coast--Dunwich--Essex coast--Estuary of the Thames--Goodwin\r\n    Sands--Coast of Kent--Formation of the Straits of Dover--South coast\r\n    of England--Sussex--Hants--Dorset--Portland--Origin of the Chesil\r\n    Bank--Cornwall--Coast of Brittany.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the movements of great bodies of water, termed tides and\r\ncurrents, are in general due to very distinct causes, their effects\r\ncannot be studied separately; for they produce, by their joint action,\r\naided by that of the waves, those changes which are objects of\r\ngeological interest. These forces may be viewed in the same manner as we\r\nbefore considered rivers, first, as employed in destroying portions of\r\nthe solid crust of the earth and removing them to other places;\r\nsecondly, as reproductive of new strata.\r\n\r\n_Tides._--It would be superfluous at the present day to offer any\r\nremarks on the cause of the tides. They are not perceptible in lakes or\r\nin most inland seas; in the Mediterranean even, deep and extensive as is\r\nthat sea, they are scarcely sensible to ordinary observation, their\r\neffects being quite subordinate to those of the winds and currents. In\r\nsome places, however, as in the Straits of Messina, there is an ebb and\r\nflow to the amount of two feet and upwards; at Naples and at the\r\nEuripus, of twelve or thirteen inches; and at Venice, according to\r\nRennell, of five feet.[378] In the Syrtes, also, of the ancients, two\r\nwide shallow gulfs, which penetrate very far within the northern coast\r\nof Africa, between Carthage and Cyrene, the rise is said to exceed five\r\nfeet.[379]\r\n\r\nIn islands remote from any continent, the ebb and flow of the ocean is\r\nvery slight, as at St. Helena, for example, where it is rarely above\r\nthree feet.[380] In any given line of coast, the tides are greatest in\r\nnarrow channels, bays, and estuaries, and least in the intervening\r\ntracts where the land is prominent. Thus, at the entrance of the estuary\r\nof the Thames and Medway, the rise of the spring tides is eighteen feet;\r\nbut when we follow our eastern coast from thence northward, towards\r\nLowestoff and Yarmouth, we find a gradual diminution, until at the\r\nplaces last mentioned, the highest rise is only seven or eight feet.\r\nFrom this point there begins again to be an increase, so that at Comer,\r\nwhere the coast again retires towards the west, the rise is sixteen\r\nfeet; and towards the extremity of the gulf called \"the Wash,\" as at\r\nLynn and in Boston Deeps, it is from twenty-two to twenty-four feet, and\r\nin some extraordinary cases twenty-six feet. From thence again there is\r\na decrease towards, the north, the elevation at the Spurn Point being\r\nfrom nineteen to twenty feet, and at Flamborough Head and the Yorkshire\r\ncoast from fourteen to sixteen feet.[381]\r\n\r\nAt Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire, at the mouth of the Bristol Channel,\r\nthe tides rise thirty-six feet; and at King-Road near Bristol, forty-two\r\nfeet. At Chepstow on the Wye, a small river which opens into the estuary\r\nof the Severn, they reach fifty feet, and sometimes sixty-nine, and even\r\nseventy-two feet. A current which sets in on the French coast, to the\r\nwest of Cape La Hague, becomes pent up by Guernsey, Jersey, and other\r\nislands, till the rise of the tide is from twenty to forty-five feet,\r\nwhich last height it attains at Jersey, and at St. Malo, a seaport of\r\nBrittany. The tides in the Basin of Mines, at the head of the Bay of\r\nFundy in Nova Scotia, rise to the height of seventy feet.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some coasts where the tides seem to offer an\r\nexception to the rule above mentioned; for while there is scarcely any\r\nrise in the estuary of the Plata in S. America, there is an extremely\r\nhigh tide on the open coast of Patagonia, farther to the south. Yet even\r\nin this region the tides reach their greatest elevation (about fifty\r\nfeet) in the Straits of Magellan, and so far at least they conform to\r\nthe general rule.[382]\r\n\r\n_Currents._--The most extensive and best determined system of currents,\r\nis that which has its source in the Indian Ocean under the influence of\r\nthe trade winds; and which, after doubling the Cape of Good Hope,\r\ninclines to the northward, along the western coast of Africa, then\r\nacross the Atlantic, near the equator, where it is called the equatorial\r\ncurrent, and is lost in the Caribbean Sea, yet seems to be again revived\r\nin the current which issues from the Gulf of Mexico. From thence it\r\nflows rapidly through the Straits of Bahama, taking the name of the Gulf\r\nStream, and passing in a northeasterly direction, by the Banks of\r\nNewfoundland, towards the Azores.\r\n\r\nWe learn from the posthumous work of Rennell on this subject, that the\r\nLagullas current, so called from the cape and bank of that name, is\r\nformed by the junction of two streams, flowing from the Indian Ocean;\r\nthe one from the channel of Mozambique, down the southeast coast of\r\nAfrica; the other from the ocean at large. The collective stream is from\r\nninety to one hundred miles in breadth, and runs at the rate of from two\r\nand a half to more than four miles per hour. It is at length turned\r\nwestward by the Lagullas bank, which rises from a sea of great depth to\r\nwithin one hundred fathoms of the surface. It must therefore be\r\ninferred, says Rennell, that the current here is more than one hundred\r\nfathoms deep, otherwise the main body of it would pass across the bank,\r\ninstead of being deflected westward, so as to flow round the Cape of\r\nGood Hope. From this cape it flows northward, as before stated, along\r\nthe western coast of Africa, taking the name of the South Atlantic\r\ncurrent. It then enters the Bight, or Bay of Benin, and is turned\r\nwestward, partly by the form of the coast there, and partly, perhaps, by\r\nthe Guinea current, which runs from the north into the same great bay.\r\nFrom the centre of this bay proceeds the equatorial current already\r\nmentioned, holding a westerly direction across the Atlantic, which it\r\ntraverses, from the coast of Guinea to that of Brazil, flowing\r\nafterwards by the shores of Guiana to the West Indies. The breadth of\r\nthis current varies from 160 to 450 geographical miles, and its velocity\r\nis from twenty-five to seventy-nine miles per day, the mean rate being\r\nabout thirty miles. The length of its whole course is about 4000 miles.\r\nAs it skirts the coast of Guiana, it is increased by the influx of the\r\nwaters of the Amazon and Orinoco, and by their junction acquires\r\naccelerated velocity. After passing the island of Trinidad it expands,\r\nand is almost lost in the Caribbean Sea; but there appears to be a\r\ngeneral movement of that sea towards the Mexican Gulf, which discharges\r\nthe most powerful of all currents through the Straits of Florida, where\r\nthe waters run in the northern part with a velocity of four or five\r\nmiles an hour, having a breadth of from thirty-five to fifty miles.[383]\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the Gulf of Mexico is 86 degrees F. in summer, or 6\r\ndegrees higher than that of the ocean, in the same parallel (25 degrees\r\nN. lat.), and a large proportion of this warmth is retained, even where\r\nthe stream reaches the 43 degrees N. lat. After issuing from the Straits\r\nof Florida, the current runs in a northerly direction to Cape Hatteras,\r\nin North Carolina, about 35 degrees N. lat., where it is more than\r\nseventy miles broad, and still moves at the rate of seventy-five miles\r\nper day. In about the 40 degrees N. lat., it is turned more towards the\r\nAtlantic by the extensive banks of Nantucket and St. George, which are\r\nfrom 200 to 300 feet beneath the surface of the sea; a clear proof that\r\nthe current exceeds that depth. On arriving near the Azores, the stream\r\nwidens, and overflows, as it were, forming a large expanse of warm water\r\nin the centre of the North Atlantic, over a space of 200 or 300 miles\r\nfrom north to south, and having a temperature of from 8 degrees to 10\r\ndegrees Fahr. above the surrounding ocean. The whole area, covered by\r\nthe Gulf water, is estimated by Rennell at 2000 miles in length, and, at\r\na mean, 350 miles in breadth; an area more extensive than that of the\r\nMediterranean. The warm water has been sometimes known to reach the Bay\r\nof Biscay, still retaining five degrees of temperature above that of the\r\nadjoining ocean; and a branch of the Gulf current occasionally drifts\r\nfruits, plants, and wood, the produce of America and the West Indies, to\r\nthe shores of Ireland and the Hebrides.\r\n\r\nFrom the above statements we may understand why Rennell has\r\ncharacterized some of the principal currents as oceanic rivers, which he\r\ndescribes as being from 50 to 250 miles in breadth, and having a\r\nrapidity exceeding that of the largest navigable rivers of the\r\ncontinents, and so deep as to be sometimes obstructed, and occasionally\r\nturned aside, by banks, the tops of which do not rise within forty,\r\nfifty, or even one hundred fathoms of the surface of the sea.[384]\r\n\r\n_Greatest velocity of currents._--The ordinary velocity of the principal\r\ncurrents of the ocean is from one to three miles per hour; but when the\r\nboundary lands converge, large bodies of water are driven gradually into\r\na narrow space, and then wanting lateral room, are compelled to raise\r\ntheir level. Whenever this occurs their velocity is much increased. The\r\ncurrent which runs through the Race of Alderney, between the island of\r\nthat name and the main land, has a velocity of about eight English miles\r\nan hour. Captain Hewett found that in the Pentland Firth, the stream, in\r\nordinary spring tides, runs ten miles and a half an hour, and about\r\nthirteen miles during violent storms. The greatest velocity of the tidal\r\ncurrent through the \"Shoots\" or New Passage, in the Bristol Channel, is\r\nfourteen English miles an hour; and Captain King observed, in his survey\r\nof the Straits of Magellan, that the tide ran at the same rate through\r\nthe \"First Narrows,\" and about eight geographical miles an hour, in\r\nother parts of those straits.\r\n\r\n_Causes of currents._--That movements of no inconsiderable magnitude\r\nshould be impressed on an expansive ocean, by winds blowing for many\r\nmonths in one direction, may easily be conceived, when we observe the\r\neffects produced in our own seas by the temporary action of the same\r\ncause. It is well known that a strong southwest or northwest wind\r\ninvariably raises the tides to an unusual height along the west coast of\r\nEngland and in the Channel; and that a northwest wind of any\r\ncontinuance causes the Baltic to rise two feet and upwards above its\r\nordinary level. Smeaton ascertained by experiment, that in a canal four\r\nmiles in length, the water was kept up four inches higher at one end\r\nthan at the other, merely by the action of the wind along the canal; and\r\nRennell informs us that a large piece of water, ten miles broad, and\r\ngenerally only three feet deep, has, by a strong wind, had its waters\r\ndriven to one side, and sustained so as to become six feet deep, while\r\nthe windward side was laid dry.[385]\r\n\r\nAs water, therefore, he observes, when pent up so that it cannot escape,\r\nacquires a higher level, so, in a place _where it can escape_, the same\r\noperation produces a current; and this current will extend to a greater\r\nor less distance, according to the force by which it is produced. By the\r\nside of the principal oceanic currents, such as the Lagullas and the\r\nGulf Stream, are parallel \"counter-currents\" running steadily in an\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\nCurrents flowing alternately in opposite directions are occasioned by\r\nthe rise and fall of the tides. The effect of this cause is, as before\r\nobserved, most striking in estuaries and channels between islands.\r\n\r\nA third cause of oceanic currents is evaporation by solar heat, of which\r\nthe great current setting through the Straits of Gibraltar into the\r\nMediterranean is a remarkable example, and will be fully considered in\r\nthe next chapter. A stream of colder water also flows from the Black Sea\r\ninto the Mediterranean. It must happen in many other parts of the world\r\nthat large quantities of water raised from one tract of the ocean by\r\nsolar heat, are carried to some other where the vapor is condensed and\r\nfalls in the shape of rain, and this, in flowing back again to restore\r\nequilibrium, will cause sensible currents.\r\n\r\nThese considerations naturally lead to the inquiry whether the level of\r\nthose seas out of which currents flow, is higher than that of seas into\r\nwhich they flow. If not, the effect must be immediately equalized by\r\nunder-currents or counter-currents. Arago is of opinion that, so far as\r\nobservations have gone, there are no exact proofs of any such difference\r\nof level. It was inferred from the measurements of M. Lepare, that the\r\nlevel of the Mediterranean, near Alexandria, was lower by 26 feet 6\r\ninches, than the Red Sea near Suez at low water, and about 30 feet lower\r\nthan the Red Sea at the same place at high water,[386] but Mr. Robert\r\nStevenson affirms, as the result of a more recent survey, that there is\r\nno difference of level between the two seas.[387]\r\n\r\nIt was formerly imagined that there was an equal, if not greater,\r\ndiversity in the relative levels of the Atlantic and Pacific, on the\r\nopposite sides of the Isthmus of Panama. But the levellings carried\r\nacross that isthmus by Capt. Lloyd, in 1828, to ascertain the relative\r\nheight of the Pacific Ocean at Panama, and of the Atlantic at the mouth\r\nof the river Chagres, have shown, that the difference of mean level\r\nbetween those oceans is not considerable, and, contrary to expectation,\r\nthe difference which does exist is in favor of the greater height of the\r\nPacific. According to this survey, the mean height of the Pacific is\r\nthree feet and a half, or 3.52 above the Atlantic, if we assume the mean\r\nlevel of a sea to coincide with the mean between the extremes of the\r\nelevation and depression of the tides; for between the extreme levels of\r\nthe greatest tides in the Pacific, at Panama, there is a difference of\r\n27.44 feet; and at the usual spring tides 21.22 feet; whereas at Chagres\r\nthis difference is only 1.16 feet, and is the same at all seasons of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe tides, in short, in the Caribbean Sea are scarcely perceptible, not\r\nequalling those in some parts of the Mediterranean, whereas the rise is\r\nvery high in the Bay of Panama; so that the Pacific is at high tide\r\nlifted up several feet above the surface of the Gulf of Mexico, and then\r\nat low water let down as far below it.[388] But astronomers are agreed\r\nthat, on mathematical principles, the rise of the tidal wave above the\r\nmean level of a particular sea must be greater than the fall below it;\r\nand although the difference has been hitherto supposed insufficient to\r\ncause an appreciable error, it is, nevertheless, worthy of observation,\r\nthat the error, such as it may be, would tend to reduce the small\r\ndifference, now inferred, from the observations of Mr. Lloyd, to exist\r\nbetween the levels of the two oceans.\r\n\r\nThere is still another way in which heat and cold must occasion great\r\nmovements in the ocean, a cause to which, perhaps, currents are\r\nprincipally due. Whenever the temperature of the surface of the sea is\r\nlowered, condensation takes place, and the superficial water, having its\r\nspecific gravity increased, falls to the bottom, upon which lighter\r\nwater rises immediately and occupies its place. When this circulation of\r\nascending and descending currents has gone on for a certain time in high\r\nlatitudes, the inferior parts of the sea are made to consist of colder\r\nor heavier fluid than the corresponding depths of the ocean between the\r\ntropics. If there be a free communication, if no chain of submarine\r\nmountains divide the polar from the equatorial basins, a horizontal\r\nmovement will arise by the flowing of colder water from the poles to the\r\nequator, and there will then be a reflux of warmer superficial water\r\nfrom the equator to the poles. A well-known experiment has been adduced\r\nto elucidate this mode of action in explanation of the \"trade\r\nwinds.\"[389] If a long trough, divided in the middle by a sluice or\r\npartition, have one end filled with water and the other with\r\nquicksilver, both fluids will remain quiet so long as they are divided;\r\nbut when the sluice is drawn up, the heavier fluid will rush along the\r\nbottom of the trough, while the lighter, being displaced, will rise,\r\nand, flowing in an opposite direction, spread itself at the top. In like\r\nmanner the expansion and contraction of sea-water by heat and cold, have\r\na tendency to set under-currents in motion from the poles to the\r\nequator, and to cause counter-currents at the surface, which are\r\nimpelled in a direction contrary to that of the prevailing trade winds.\r\nThe geographical and other circumstances being very complicated, we\r\ncannot expect to trace separately the movements due to each cause, but\r\nmust be prepared for many anomalies, especially as the configuration of\r\nthe bed of the ocean must often modify and interfere with the course of\r\nthe inferior currents, as much as the position and form of continents\r\nand islands alter the direction of those on the surface. Thus on\r\nsounding at great depths in the Mediterranean, Captains Berard and\r\nD'Urville have found that the cold does not increase in a high ratio as\r\nin the tropical regions of the ocean, the thermometer remaining fixed at\r\nabout 55 degrees F. between the depths of 1000 and 6000 feet. This might\r\nhave been anticipated, as Captain Smyth in his survey had shown that the\r\ndeepest part of the Straits of Gibraltar is only 1320 feet, so that a\r\nsubmarine barrier exists there which must prevent the influx of any\r\nunder-current of the ocean cooled by polar ice.\r\n\r\nEach of the four causes above mentioned, the wind, the tides,\r\nevaporation, and the expansion and contraction of water by heat and\r\ncold, may be conceived to operate independently of the others, and\r\nalthough the influence of all the rest were annihilated. But there is\r\nanother cause, the rotation of the earth on its axis, which can only\r\ncome into play when the waters have already been set in motion by some\r\none or all of the forces above described, and when the direction of the\r\ncurrent so raised happens to be from south to north, or from north to\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThe principle on which this cause operates is probably familiar to the\r\nreader, as it has long been recognized in the case of the trade winds.\r\nWithout enlarging, therefore, on the theory, it will be sufficient to\r\noffer an example of the mode of action alluded to. When a current flows\r\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope towards the Gulf of Guinea, it consists of a\r\nmass of water, which, on doubling the Cape, in lat. 35 degrees, has a\r\nrotatory velocity of about 800 miles an hour; but when it reaches the\r\nline, where it turns westward, it has arrived at a parallel where the\r\nsurface of the earth is whirled round at the rate of 1000 miles an hour,\r\nor about 200 miles faster. If this great mass of water was transferred\r\nsuddenly from the higher to the lower latitude, the deficiency of its\r\nrotatory motion, relatively to the land and water with which it would\r\ncome into juxtaposition, would be such as to cause an apparent motion of\r\nthe most rapid kind (of no less than 200 miles an hour) from east to\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nIn the case of such a sudden transfer, the eastern coast of America,\r\nbeing carried round in an opposite direction, might strike against a\r\nlarge body of water with tremendous violence, and a considerable part of\r\nthe continent might be submerged. This disturbance does not occur,\r\nbecause the water of the stream, as it advances gradually into new zones\r\nof the sea which are moving more rapidly, acquires by friction an\r\naccelerated velocity. Yet as this motion is not imparted\r\ninstantaneously, the fluid is unable to keep up with the full speed of\r\nthe new surface over which it is successively brought. Hence, to borrow\r\nthe language of Herschel, when he speaks of the trade winds, \"it lags or\r\nhangs back, in a direction opposite to the earth's rotation, that is,\r\nfrom east to west,\"[390] and thus a current, which would have run simply\r\ntowards the north but for the rotation, may acquire a relative direction\r\ntowards the west.\r\n\r\nWe may next consider a case where the circumstances are the converse of\r\nthe above. The Gulf Stream flowing from about lat. 20 degrees is at first\r\nimpressed with a velocity of rotation of about 940 miles an hour, and\r\nruns to the lat. 40 degrees, where the earth revolves only at the rate\r\nof 766 miles, or 174 miles slower. In this case a relative motion of an\r\nopposite kind may result; and the current may retain an excess of\r\nrotatory velocity, tending continually to deflect it eastward. Polar\r\ncurrents, therefore, or those flowing from high to low latitudes, are\r\ndriven towards the eastern shores of continents, while tropical currents\r\nflowing towards the poles are directed against their western shores.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that currents depend, like the tides, on no\r\ntemporary or accidental circumstances, but on the laws which preside\r\nover the motions of the heavenly bodies. But although the sum of their\r\ninfluence in altering the surface of the earth may be very constant\r\nthroughout successive epochs, yet the points where these operations are\r\ndisplayed in fullest energy shift perpetually. The height to which the\r\ntides rise, and the violence and velocity of currents, depend in a great\r\nmeasure on the actual configuration of the land, the contour of a long\r\nline of continental or insular coast, the depth and breadth of channels,\r\nthe peculiar form of the bottom of seas--in a word, on a combination of\r\ncircumstances which are made to vary continually by many igneous and\r\naqueous causes, and, amongst the rest, by the tides and currents\r\nthemselves. Although these agents, therefore, of decay and reproduction\r\nare local in reference to periods of short duration, such as those which\r\nhistory embraces, they are nevertheless universal, if we extend our\r\nviews to a sufficient lapse of ages.\r\n\r\n_Destroying and transporting power of currents._--After these\r\npreliminary remarks on the nature and causes of currents, their velocity\r\nand direction, we may next consider their action on the solid materials\r\nof the earth. We shall find that their efforts are, in many respects,\r\nstrictly analogous to those of rivers. I have already treated in the\r\nthird chapter, of the manner in which currents sometimes combine with\r\nice, in carrying mud, pebbles, and large fragments of rock to great\r\ndistances. Their operations are more concealed from our view than those\r\nof rivers, but extend over wider areas, and are therefore of more\r\ngeological importance.\r\n\r\n_Waste of the British coasts._--_Shetland Islands_.--If we follow the\r\neastern and southern shores of the British islands, from our Ultima\r\nThule in Shetland to the Land's End in Cornwall, we shall find evidence\r\nof a series of changes since the historical era, very illustrative of\r\nthe kind and degree of force exerted by tides and currents co-operating\r\nwith the waves of the sea. In this survey we shall have an opportunity\r\nof tracing their joint power on islands, promontories, bays, and\r\nestuaries; on bold, lofty cliffs, as well as on low shores; and on every\r\ndescription of rock and soil, from granite to blown sand.\r\n\r\nThe northernmost group of the British islands, the Shetland, are\r\ncomposed of a great variety of rocks, including granite, gneiss,\r\nmica-slate, serpentine, greenstone, and many others, with some secondary\r\nrocks, chiefly sandstone and conglomerate. These islands are exposed\r\ncontinually to the uncontrolled violence of the Atlantic, for no land\r\nintervenes between their western shores and America. The prevalence,\r\ntherefore, of strong westerly gales, causes the waves to be sometimes\r\ndriven with irresistible force upon the coast, while there is also a\r\ncurrent setting from the north. The spray of the sea aids the\r\ndecomposition of the rocks, and prepares them to be breached by the\r\nmechanical force of the waves. Steep cliffs are hollowed out into deep\r\ncaves and lofty arches; and almost every promontory ends in a cluster of\r\nrocks, imitating the forms of columns, pinnacles, and obelisks.\r\n\r\n_Drifting of large masses of rock._--Modern observations show that the\r\nreduction of continuous tracts to such insular masses is a process in\r\nwhich nature is still actively engaged. \"The isle of Stenness,\" says Dr.\r\nHibbert, \"presents a scene of unequalled desolation. In stormy winters,\r\nhuge blocks of stones are overturned, or are removed from their native\r\nbeds, and hurried up a slight acclivity to a distance almost incredible.\r\nIn the winter of 1802, a tabular-shaped mass, eight feet two inches by\r\nseven feet, and five feet one inch thick, was dislodged from its bed,\r\nand removed to a distance of from eighty to ninety feet. I measured the\r\nrecent bed from which a block had been carried away the preceding winter\r\n(A. D. 1818), and found it to be seventeen feet and a half by seven\r\nfeet, and the depth two feet eight inches. The removed mass had been\r\nborne to a distance of thirty feet, when it was shivered into thirteen\r\nor more lesser fragments, some of which, were carried still farther,\r\nfrom 30 to 120 feet. A block, nine feet two inches by six feet and a\r\nhalf, and four feet thick, was hurried up the acclivity to a distance of\r\n150 feet.\"[391]\r\n\r\nAt Northmavine, also, angular blocks of stone have been removed in a\r\nsimilar manner to considerable distances by the waves of the sea, some\r\nof which are represented in the annexed figure.\r\n\r\n_Effects of lightning._--In addition to numerous examples of masses\r\ndetached and driven by the waves, tides, and currents from their place,\r\nsome remarkable effects of lightning are recorded in these isles. At\r\nFunzie, in Fetlar, about the middle of the last century, a rock of\r\nmica-schist, 105 feet long, ten feet broad, and in some places four feet\r\nthick, was in an instant torn by a flash of lightning from its bed, and\r\nbroken into three large and several smaller fragments. One of these,\r\ntwenty-six feet long, ten feet broad, and four feet thick, was simply\r\nturned over. The second, which was twenty-eight feet long, seventeen\r\nbroad, and five feet in thickness, was hurled across a high point to the\r\ndistance of fifty yards. Another broken mass, about forty feet long, was\r\nthrown still farther, but in the same direction, quite into the sea.\r\nThere were also many smaller fragments scattered up and down.[392]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.\r\n\r\nStony fragments drifted by the sea. Northmavine, Shetland.]\r\n\r\nWhen we thus see electricity co-operating with the violent movements of\r\nthe ocean in heaping up piles of shattered rocks on dry land and beneath\r\nthe waters, we cannot but admit that a region which shall be the\r\ntheatre, for myriads of ages, of the action of such disturbing causes,\r\nmight present, at some future period, if upraised far above the bosom of\r\nthe deep, a scene of havoc and ruin that may compare with any now found\r\nby the geologist on the surface of our continents.\r\n\r\nIn some of the Shetland Isles, as on the west of Meikle Roe, dikes, or\r\nveins of soft granite, have mouldered away; while the matrix in which\r\nthey were inclosed, being of the same substance, but of a firmer\r\ntexture, has remained unaltered. Thus, long narrow ravines, sometimes\r\ntwenty feet wide, are laid open, and often give access to the waves.\r\nAfter describing some huge cavernous apertures into which the sea flows\r\nfor 250 feet in Roeness, Dr. Hibbert, writing in 1822, enumerates other\r\nravages of the ocean. \"A mass of rock, the average dimensions of which\r\nmay perhaps be rated at twelve or thirteen feet square, and four and a\r\nhalf or five in thickness, was first moved from its bed, about fifty\r\nyears ago, to a distance of thirty feet, and has since been twice turned\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\n_Passage forced by the sea through porphyritic rocks._--\"But the most\r\nsublime scene is where a mural pile of porphyry, escaping the process\r\nof disintegration that is devastating the coast, appears to have been\r\nleft as a sort of rampart against the inroads of the ocean;--the\r\nAtlantic, when provoked by wintry gales, batters against it with all the\r\nforce of real artillery--the waves having, in their repeated assaults,\r\nforced themselves an entrance. This breach, named the Grind of the Navir\r\n(fig. 28), is widened every winter by the overwhelming surge that,\r\nfinding a passage through it, separates large stones from its sides, and\r\nforces them to a distance of no less than 180 feet. In two or three\r\nspots, the fragments which have been detached are brought together in\r\nimmense heaps, that appear as an accumulation of cubical masses, the\r\nproduct of some quarry.\"[393]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.\r\n\r\nGrind of the Navir--passage forced by the sea through rocks of hard\r\nporphyry.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident from this example, that although the greater\r\nindestructibility of some rocks may enable them to withstand, for a\r\nlonger time, the action of the elements, yet they cannot permanently\r\nresist. There are localities in Shetland, in which rocks of almost every\r\nvariety of mineral composition are suffering disintegration; thus the\r\nsea makes great inroads on the clay slate of Fitfel Head, on the\r\nserpentine of the Vord Hill in Fetlar, and on the mica-schist of the Bay\r\nof Triesta, on the east coast of the same island, which decomposes into\r\nangular blocks. The quartz rock on the east of Walls, and the gneiss and\r\nmica-schist of Garthness, suffer the same fate.\r\n\r\n_Destruction of islands._--Such devastation cannot be incessantly\r\ncommitted for thousands of years without dividing islands, until they\r\nbecome at last mere clusters of rocks, the last shreds of masses once\r\ncontinuous. To this state many appear to have been reduced, and\r\ninnumerable fantastic forms are assumed by rocks adjoining these islands\r\nto which the name of Drongs is applied, as it is to those of similar\r\nshape in Feroe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.\r\n\r\nGranitic rocks named the Drongs, between Papa Stour and Hillswick Ness.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.\r\n\r\nGranitic rocks to the south of Hillswick Ness, Shetland.]\r\n\r\nThe granite rocks (fig. 29), between Papa Stour and Hillswick Ness\r\nafford an example. A still more singular cluster of rocks is seen to the\r\nsouth of Hillswick Ness (fig. 30), which presents a variety of forms as\r\nviewed from different points, and has often been likened to a small\r\nfleet of vessels with spread sails.[394] We may imagine that in the\r\ncourse of time Hillswick Ness itself may present a similar wreck, from\r\nthe unequal decomposition of the rocks whereof it is composed,\r\nconsisting of gneiss and mica-schist traversed in all directions by\r\nveins of felspar-porphyry.\r\n\r\nMidway between the groups of Shetland and Orkney is Fair Island, said to\r\nbe composed of sandstone with high perpendicular cliffs. The current\r\nruns with such velocity, that during a calm, and when there is no swell,\r\nthe rocks on its shores are white with the foam of the sea driven\r\nagainst them. The Orkneys, if carefully examined, would probably\r\nillustrate our present topic as much as the Shetland group. The\r\nnortheast promontory of Sanda, one of these islands, has been cut off in\r\nmodern times by the sea, so that it became what is now called Start\r\nIsland, where a lighthouse was erected in 1807, since which time the new\r\nstrait has grown broader.\r\n\r\n_East coast of Scotland._--To pass over to the main land of Scotland, we\r\nfind that in Inverness-shire there have been inroads of the sea at Fort\r\nGeorge, and others in Morayshire, which have swept away the old town of\r\nFindhorn. On the coast of Kincardineshire, an illustration was afforded\r\nat the close of the last century, of the effect of promontories in\r\nprotecting a line of low shore. The village of Mathers, two miles south\r\nof Johnshaven, was built on an ancient shingle beach, protected by a\r\nprojecting ledge of limestone rock. This was quarried for lime to such\r\nan extent that the sea broke through, and in 1795 carried away the whole\r\nvillage in one night, and penetrated 150 yards inland, where it has\r\nmaintained its ground ever since, the new village having been built\r\nfarther inland on the new shore. In the bay of Montrose, we find the\r\nNorth Esk and the South Esk rivers pouring annually into the sea large\r\nquantities of sand and pebbles; yet they have formed no deltas, for the\r\nwaves, aided by the current, setting across their mouths, sweep away all\r\nthe materials. Considerable beds of shingle, brought down by the North\r\nEsk, are seen along the beach.\r\n\r\nProceeding southwards, we learn that at Arbroath, in Forfarshire, which\r\nstands on a rock of red sandstone, gardens and houses have been carried\r\naway since the commencement of the present century by encroachments of\r\nthe sea. It had become necessary before 1828, to remove the lighthouses\r\nat the mouth of the estuary of the Tay, in the same county, at Button\r\nNess, which were built on a tract of blown sand, the sea having\r\nencroached for three-quarters of a mile.\r\n\r\n_Force of waves and currents in estuaries._--The combined power which\r\nwaves and currents can exert in _estuaries_ (a term which I confine to\r\nbays entered both by rivers and the tides of the sea), was remarkably\r\nexhibited during the building of the Bell Rock Lighthouse, off the mouth\r\nof the Tay. The Bell Rock is a sunken reef, consisting of red sandstone,\r\nbeing from twelve to sixteen feet under the surface at high water, and\r\nabout twelve miles from the mainland. At the distance of 100 yards,\r\nthere is a depth, in all directions of two or three fathoms at low\r\nwater. In 1807, during the erection of the lighthouse, six large blocks\r\nof granite, which had been landed on the reef, were removed by the force\r\nof the sea, and thrown over a rising ledge to the distance of twelve or\r\nfifteen paces; and an anchor, weighing about 22 cwt., was thrown up upon\r\nthe rock.[395] Mr. Stevenson informs us moreover, that drift stones,\r\nmeasuring upwards of thirty cubic feet, or more than two tons' weight,\r\nhave, during storms, been often thrown upon the rock from the deep\r\nwater.[396]\r\n\r\n_Submarine forests._--Among the proofs that the sea has encroached on\r\nthe land bordering the estuary of the Tay, Dr. Fleming has mentioned a\r\nsubmarine forest which has been traced for several miles along the\r\nnorthern shore of the county of Fife.[397] But subsequent surveys seem\r\nto have shown that the bed of peat containing tree-roots, leaves, and\r\nbranches, now occurring at a lower level than the Tay, must have come\r\ninto its present position by a general sinking of the ground on which\r\nthe forest grew. The peat-bed alluded to is not confined, says Mr.\r\nBuist, to the present channel of the Tay, but extends far beyond it, and\r\nis covered by stratified clay from fifteen to twenty-five feet in\r\nthickness, in the midst of which, in some places, is a bed full of\r\nsea-shells.[398] Recent discoveries having established the fact that\r\nupward and downward movements have affected our island since the general\r\ncoast-line had nearly acquired its present shape, we must hesitate\r\nbefore we attribute any given change to a single cause, such as the\r\nlocal encroachment of the sea upon low land.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Fife, at St. Andrew's, a tract of land, said to have\r\nintervened between the castle of Cardinal Beaton and the sea, has been\r\nentirely swept away, as were the last remains of the Priory of Crail, in\r\nthe same county, in 1803. On both sides of the Frith of Forth, land has\r\nbeen consumed; at North Berwick in particular, and at Newhaven, where an\r\narsenal and dock, built in the reign of James IV., in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, has been overflowed.\r\n\r\n_East coast of England._--If we now proceed to the English coast, we\r\nfind records of numerous lands having been destroyed in Northumberland,\r\nas those near Bamborough and Holy Island, and at Tynemouth Castle, which\r\nnow overhangs the sea, although formerly separated from it by a strip of\r\nland. At Hartlepool, and several other parts of the coast of Durham\r\ncomposed of magnesian limestone, the sea has made considerable inroads.\r\n\r\n_Coast of Yorkshire._--Almost the whole coast of Yorkshire, from the\r\nmouth of the Tees to that of the Humber, is in a state of gradual\r\ndilapidation. That part of the cliffs which consist of lias, the oolite\r\nseries, and chalk, decays slowly. They present abrupt and naked\r\nprecipices, often 300 feet in height; and it is only at a few points\r\nthat the grassy covering of the sloping talus marks a temporary\r\nrelaxation of the erosive action of the sea. The chalk cliffs are worn\r\ninto caves and needles in the projecting headland of Flamborough, where\r\nthey are decomposed by the salt spray, and slowly crumble away. But the\r\nwaste is most rapid between that promontory and Spurn Point, or the\r\ncoast of Holderness, as it is called, a tract consisting of beds of\r\nclay, gravel, sand, and chalk rubble. The irregular intermixture of the\r\nargillaceous beds causes many springs to be thrown out, and this\r\nfacilitates the undermining process, the waves beating against them, and\r\na strong current setting chiefly from the north. The wasteful action is\r\nvery conspicuous at Dimlington Height, the loftiest point in Holderness,\r\nwhere the beacon stands on a cliff 146 feet above high water, the whole\r\nbeing composed of clay, with pebbles scattered through it.[399] \"For\r\nmany years,\" says Professor Phillips, \"the rate at which the cliffs\r\nrecede from Bridlington to Spurn, a distance of thirty-six miles, has\r\nbeen found by measurement to equal on an average two and a quarter yards\r\nannually, which, upon thirty-six miles of coast, would amount to about\r\nthirty acres a year. At this rate, the coast, the mean height of which\r\nabove the sea is about forty feet, has lost one mile in breadth since\r\nthe Norman Conquest, and more than two miles since the occupation of\r\nYork (Eboracum) by the Romans.\"[400] The extent of this denudation, as\r\nestimated by the number of cubic feet of matter removed annually, will\r\nbe again spoken of in chapter 22.\r\n\r\nIn the old maps of Yorkshire, we find spots, now sand-banks in the sea,\r\nmarked as the ancient sites of the towns and villages of Auburn,\r\nHartburn, and Hyde. \"Of Hyde,\" says Pennant, \"only the tradition is\r\nleft; and near the village of Hornsea, a street called Hornsea Beck has\r\nlong since been swallowed.\"[401] Owthorne and its church have also been\r\nin great part destroyed, and the village of Kilnsea; but these places\r\nare now removed farther inland. The annual rate of encroachment at\r\nOwthorne for several years preceding 1830, is stated to have averaged\r\nabout four yards. Not unreasonable fears are entertained that at some\r\nfuture time the Spurn Point will become an island, and that the ocean,\r\nentering into the estuary of the Humber, will cause great\r\ndevastation.[402] Pennant, after speaking of the silting up of some\r\nancient ports in that estuary, observes, \"But, in return, the sea has\r\nmade most ample reprisals; the site, and even the very names of several\r\nplaces, once towns of note upon the Humber, are now only recorded in\r\nhistory; and Ravensper was at one time a rival to Hull (Madox, Ant.\r\nExch. i. 422), and a port so very considerable in 1332, that Edward\r\nBaliol and the confederated English barons sailed from hence to invade\r\nScotland; and Henry IV., in 1399, made choice of this port to land at,\r\nto effect the deposal of Richard II.; yet the whole of this has long\r\nsince been devoured by the merciless ocean; extensive sands, dry at low\r\nwater, are to be seen in their stead.\"[403]\r\n\r\nPennant describes Spurn Head as a promontory in the form of a sickle,\r\nand says the land, for some miles to the north, was \"perpetually preyed\r\non by the fury of the German Sea, which devours whole acres at a time,\r\nand exposes on the shores considerable quantities of beautiful amber.\"\r\n\r\n_Lincolnshire._--The maritime district of Lincolnshire consists chiefly\r\nof lands that lie below the level of the sea, being protected by\r\nembankments. Some of the fens were embanked and drained by the Romans;\r\nbut after their departure the sea returned, and large tracts were\r\ncovered with beds of silt, containing marine shells, now again converted\r\ninto productive lands. Many dreadful catastrophes are recorded by\r\nincursions of the sea, whereby several parishes have been at different\r\ntimes overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n_Norfolk._--The decay of the cliffs of Norfolk and Suffolk is incessant.\r\nAt Hunstanton, on the north, the undermining of the lower arenaceous\r\nbeds at the foot of the cliff, causes masses of red and white chalk to\r\nbe precipitated from above. Between Hunstanton and Weybourne, low hills,\r\nor dunes, of blown sand, are formed along the shore, from fifty to sixty\r\nfeet high. They are composed of dry sand, bound in a compact mass by the\r\nlong creeping roots of the plant called Marram (_Arundo arenaria_). Such\r\nis the present set of the tides, that the harbors of Clay, Wells, and\r\nother places are securely defended by these barriers; affording a clear\r\nproof that it is not the strength of the material at particular points\r\nthat determines whether the sea shall be progressive or stationary, but\r\nthe general contour of the coast.\r\n\r\nThe waves constantly undermine the low chalk cliffs, covered with sand\r\nand clay, between Weybourne and Sherringham, a certain portion of them\r\nbeing annually removed. At the latter town I ascertained, in 1829, some\r\nfacts which throw light on the rate at which the sea gains upon the\r\nland. It was computed, when the present inn was built, in 1805, that it\r\nwould require seventy years for the sea to reach the spot: the mean loss\r\nof land being calculated, from previous observations, to be somewhat\r\nless than one yard, annually. The distance between the house and the sea\r\nwas fifty yards; but no allowance was made for the slope of the ground\r\nbeing _from_ the sea, in consequence of which the waste was naturally\r\naccelerated every year, as the cliff grew lower, there being at each\r\nsucceeding period less matter to remove when portions of equal area fell\r\ndown. Between the years 1824 and 1829, no less than seventeen yards were\r\nswept away, and only a small garden was then left between the building\r\nand the sea. There was, in 1829, a depth of twenty feet (sufficient to\r\nfloat a frigate) at one point in the harbor of that port, where, only\r\nforty-eight years before, there stood a cliff fifty feet high, with\r\nhouses upon it! If once in half a century an equal amount of change were\r\nproduced suddenly by the momentary shock of an earthquake, history would\r\nbe filled with records of such wonderful revolutions of the earth's\r\nsurface; but, if the conversion of high land into deep sea be gradual,\r\nit excites only local attention. The flagstaff of the Preventive Service\r\nstation, on the south side of this harbor, was thrice removed inland\r\nbetween the years 1814 and 1829, in consequence of the advance of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nFarther to the south we find cliffs, composed, like those of Holderness\r\nbefore mentioned, of alternating strata of blue clay, gravel, loam, and\r\nfine sand. Although they sometimes exceed 300 feet in height, the havoc\r\nmade on the coast is most formidable. The whole site of ancient Cromer\r\nnow forms part of the German Ocean, the inhabitants having gradually\r\nretreated inland to their present situation, from whence the sea still\r\nthreatens to dislodge them. In the winter of 1825, a fallen mass was\r\nprecipitated from near the lighthouse, which covered twelve acres,\r\nextending far into the sea, the cliffs being 250 feet in height.[404]\r\nThe undermining by springs has sometimes caused large portions of the\r\nupper part of the cliffs, with houses still standing upon them, to give\r\nway, so that it is impossible, by erecting breakwaters at the base of\r\nthe cliffs, permanently to ward off the danger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.\r\n\r\nTower of the buried Church of Eccles, Norfolk, A. D. 1839.\r\n\r\nThe inland slope of the hills of blown sand is shown in this view, with\r\nthe lighthouse of Hasborough in the distance.]\r\n\r\nOn the same coast, says Mr. R. C. Taylor, the ancient villages of\r\nShipden, Wimpwell, and Eccles have disappeared; several manors and large\r\nportions of neighboring parishes having, piece after piece, been\r\nswallowed up; nor has there been any intermission, from time immemorial,\r\nin the ravages of the sea along a line of coast twenty miles in length,\r\nin which these places stood.[405] Of Eccles, however, a monument still\r\nremains in the rained tower of the old church, which is half buried in\r\nthe dunes of sand within a few paces (60?) of the sea-beach (fig. 31).\r\nSo early as 1605 the inhabitants petitioned James I. for a reduction of\r\ntaxes, as 300 acres of land, and all their houses, save fourteen, had\r\nthen been destroyed by the sea. Not one half that number of acres now\r\nremains in the parish, and hills of blown sand now occupy the site of\r\nthe houses which were still extant in 1605. When I visited the spot in\r\n1839, the sea was fast encroaching on the sand-hills, and had laid open\r\non the beach the foundations of a house fourteen yards square, the upper\r\npart of which had evidently been pulled down before it had been buried\r\nunder sand. The body of the church has also been long buried, but the\r\ntower still remains visible.\r\n\r\nM. E. de Beaumont has suggested that sand-dunes in Holland and other\r\ncountries may serve as natural chronometers, by which the date of the\r\nexisting continents may be ascertained. The sands, he says, are\r\ncontinually blown inland by the force of the winds, and by observing the\r\nrate of their march we may calculate the period when the movement\r\ncommenced.[406] But the example just given will satisfy every geologist\r\nthat we cannot ascertain the starting-point of dunes, all coasts being\r\nliable to waste, and the shores of the Low Countries in particular,\r\nbeing not only exposed to inroads of the sea, but, as M. de Beaumont\r\nhimself has well shown, having even in historical times undergone a\r\nchange of level. The dunes may indeed, in some cases, be made use of as\r\nchronometers, to enable us to assign a minimum of antiquity to existing\r\ncoast-lines; but this test must be applied with great caution, so\r\nvariable is the rate at which the sands may advance into the interior.\r\n\r\nHills of blown sand, between Eccles and Winterton, have barred up and\r\nexcluded the tide for many hundred years from the mouths of several\r\nsmall estuaries; but there are records of nine breaches, from 20 to 120\r\nyards wide, having been made through these, by which immense damage was\r\ndone to the low grounds in the interior. A few miles south of\r\nHappisburgh, also, are hills of blown sand, which extend to Yarmouth.\r\nThese _dunes_ afford a temporary protection to the coast, and an inland\r\ncliff, about a mile long, at Winterton, shows clearly that at that point\r\nthe sea must have penetrated formerly farther than at present.\r\n\r\n_Silting up of estuaries_--At Yarmouth, the sea has not advanced upon\r\nthe sands in the slightest degree since the reign of Elizabeth. In the\r\ntime of the Saxons, a great estuary extended as far as Norwich, which\r\ncity, is represented; even in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,\r\nas \"situated on the banks of an arm of the sea.\" The sands whereon\r\nYarmouth is built, first became firm and habitable ground about the year\r\n1008, from which time a line of dunes has gradually increased in height\r\nand breadth, stretching across the whole entrance of the ancient\r\nestuary, and obstructing the ingress of the tides so completely, that\r\nthey are only admitted by the narrow passage which the river keeps open,\r\nand which has gradually shifted several miles to the south. The ordinary\r\ntides at the river's mouth rise, at present, only to the height, of\r\nthree or four feet, the spring tides to about eight or nine.\r\n\r\nBy the exclusion of the sea, thousands of acres in the interior have\r\nbecome cultivated lands; and, exclusive of smaller pools, upwards of\r\nsixty freshwater lakes have been formed, varying in depth from fifteen\r\nto thirty feet, and in extent from one acre to twelve hundred.[407] The\r\nYare, and other rivers, frequently communicate with these sheets of\r\nwater; and thus they are liable to be filled up gradually with\r\nlacustrine and fluviatile deposits, and to be converted into land\r\ncovered with forests. Yet it must not be imagined, that the acquisition\r\nof new land fit for cultivation in Norfolk and Suffolk indicates any\r\npermanent growth of the eastern limits of our island to compensate its\r\nreiterated losses. No _delta_ can form on such a shore.\r\n\r\nImmediately off Yarmouth, and parallel to the shore, is a great range of\r\nsand-banks, the shape of which varies slowly from year to year, and\r\noften suddenly after great storms. Captain Hewitt, R. N., found in these\r\nbanks, in 1836, a broad channel sixty-five feet deep, where there was\r\nonly a depth of four feet during a prior survey in 1822. The sea had\r\nexcavated to the depth of sixty feet in the course of fourteen years, or\r\nperhaps a shorter period. The new channel thus formed serves at present\r\n(1838), for the entrance of ships into Yarmouth Roads; and the magnitude\r\nof this change shows how easily a new set of the waves and currents\r\nmight endanger the submergence of the land gained within the ancient\r\nestuary of the Yare.\r\n\r\nThat great banks should be thrown across the mouths of estuaries on our\r\neastern coast, where there is not a large body of river-water to\r\nmaintain an open channel, is perfectly intelligible, when we bear in\r\nmind that the marine current, sweeping along the coast, is charged with\r\nthe materials of wasting cliffs, and ready to form a bar anywhere the\r\ninstant its course is interrupted or checked by any opposing stream. The\r\nmouth of the Yare has been, within the last five centuries, diverted\r\nabout four miles to the south. In like manner it is evident that, at\r\nsome remote period, the river Alde entered the sea at Aldborough, until\r\nits ancient outlet was barred up and at length transferred to a point no\r\nless than ten miles distant to the southwest. In this case, ridges of\r\nsand and shingle, like those of Lowestoff Ness, which will be described\r\nby and by, have been thrown up between the river and the sea; and an\r\nancient sea-cliff is to be seen now inland.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked why the rivers on our east coast are always deflected\r\nsouthwards, although the tidal current flows alternately from the south\r\nand north? The cause is to be found in the superior force of what is\r\ncommonly called \"the flood tide from the north,\" a tidal wave derived\r\nfrom the Atlantic, a small part of which passes eastward up the English\r\nChannel, and through the Straits of Dover and then northwards, while the\r\nprincipal body of water, moving much more rapidly in a more open sea, on\r\nthe western side of Britain, first passes the Orkneys, and then turning,\r\nflows down between Norway and Scotland, and sweeps with great velocity\r\nalong our eastern coast. It is well known that the highest tides on this\r\ncoast are occasioned by a powerful northwest wind, which raises the\r\neastern part of the Atlantic, and causes it to pour a greater volume of\r\nwater into the German Ocean. This circumstance of a violent _off-shore_\r\nwind being attended with a rise of the waters, instead of a general\r\nretreat of the sea, naturally excites the wonder of the inhabitants of\r\nour coast. In many districts they look with confidence for a rich\r\nharvest of that valuable manure, the sea-weed, when the north-westerly\r\ngales prevail, and are rarely disappointed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.\r\n\r\nMap of Lowestoff Ness, Suffolk.[408]\r\n\r\n_a_, _a_. The dotted lines express a series of sand and shingle, forming\r\nthe extremity of the triangular space called the Ness.\r\n\r\n_b_, _b_, _b_. The dark line represents the inland cliff on which the\r\ntown of Lowestoff stands, between which and the sea is the Ness.]\r\n\r\n_Coast of Suffolk._--The cliffs of Suffolk, to which we next proceed,\r\nare somewhat less elevated than those of Norfolk, but composed of\r\nsimilar alternations of clay, sand, and gravel. From Gorleston in\r\nSuffolk, to within a few miles north of Lowestoff, the cliffs are slowly\r\nundermined. Near the last-mentioned town, there is an inland cliff about\r\nsixty feet high, the sloping talus of which is covered with turf and\r\nheath. Between the cliff and the sea is a low flat tract of sand called\r\nthe Ness, nearly three miles long, and for the most part out of reach of\r\nthe highest tides. The point of the Ness projects from the base of the\r\noriginal cliff to the distance of 660 yards. This accession of land,\r\nsays Mr. Taylor, has been effected at distinct and distant intervals, by\r\nthe influence of currents running between the land and a shoal about a\r\nmile off Lowestoff, called the Holm Sand. The lines of growth in the\r\nNess are indicated by a series of concentric ridges or embankments\r\ninclosing limited areas, and several of these ridges have been formed\r\nwithin the observation of persons now living. A rampart of heavy\r\nmaterials is first thrown up to an unusual altitude by some\r\nextraordinary tide, attended with a violent gale. Subsequent tides\r\nextend the base of this high bank of shingle, and the interstices are\r\nthen filled with sand blown from the beach. The Arundo and other marine\r\nplants by degrees obtain a footing; and creeping along the ridge, give\r\nsolidity to the mass, and form in some cases a matted covering of turf.\r\nMeanwhile another mound is forming externally, which by the like process\r\nrises and gives protection to the first. If the sea forces its way\r\nthrough one of the external and incomplete mounds, the breach is soon\r\nrepaired. After a while the marine plants within the areas inclosed by\r\nthese embankments are succeeded by a better species of herbage affording\r\ngood pasturage, and the sands become sufficiently firm to support\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n_Destruction of Dunwich by the sea._--Of the gradual destruction of\r\nDunwich, once the most considerable seaport on this coast, we have many\r\nauthentic records. Gardner, in his history of that borough, published\r\nin 1754, shows, by reference to documents, beginning with Doomsday Book,\r\nthat the cliffs at Dunwich, Southwold, Eastern, and Pakefield, have been\r\nalways subject to wear away. At Dunwich, in particular, two tracts of\r\nland which had been taxed in the eleventh century, in the time of King\r\nEdward the Confessor, are mentioned in the Conqueror's survey, made but\r\na few years afterwards, as having been devoured by the sea. The losses,\r\nat a subsequent period, of a monastery,--at another of several\r\nchurches,--afterwards of the old port,--then of four hundred houses at\r\nonce,--of the church of St. Leonard, the high-road, town-hall, jail, and\r\nmany other buildings, are mentioned, with the dates when they perished.\r\nIt is stated that, in the sixteenth century, not one-quarter of the town\r\nwas left standing; yet the inhabitants retreating inland, the name was\r\npreserved, as has been the case with many other ports when their ancient\r\nsite has been blotted out. There is, however, a church of considerable\r\nantiquity still standing, the last of twelve mentioned in some records.\r\nIn 1740, the laying open of the churchyard of St. Nicholas and St.\r\nFrancis, in the sea-cliffs, is well described by Gardner, with the\r\ncoffins and skeletons exposed to view--some lying on the beach, and\r\nrocked\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"In cradle of the rude imperious surge.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOf these cemeteries no remains can now be seen. Ray also says, \"that\r\nancient writings make mention of a wood a mile and a half to the east of\r\nDunwich, the site of which must at present be so far within the\r\nsea.\"[409] This city, once so flourishing and populous, is now a small\r\nvillage, with about twenty houses, and one hundred inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThere is an old tradition, \"that the tailors sat in their shops at\r\nDunwich, and saw the ships in Yarmouth Bay;\" but when we consider how\r\nfar the coast at Lowestoff Ness projects between these places, we cannot\r\ngive credit to the tale, which, nevertheless, proves how much the\r\ninroads of the sea in times of old had prompted men of lively\r\nimagination to indulge their taste for the marvellous.\r\n\r\nGardner's description of the cemeteries laid open by the waves reminds\r\nus of the scene which has been so well depicted by Bewick,[410] and of\r\nwhich numerous points on the same coast might have suggested the idea.\r\nOn the verge of a cliff, which the sea has undermined, are represented\r\nthe unshaken tower and western end of an abbey. The eastern aisle is\r\ngone, and the pillars of the cloister are soon to follow. The waves have\r\nalmost isolated the promontory, and invaded the cemetery, where they\r\nhave made sport with the mortal relics, and thrown up a skull upon the\r\nbeach. In the foreground is seen a broken tombstone, erected, as its\r\nlegend tells, \"to _perpetuate_ the memory\"--of one whose name is\r\nobliterated, as is that of the county for which he was \"Custos\r\nRotulorum.\" A cormorant is perched on the monument, defiling it, as if\r\nto remind some moralizer like Hamlet, of \"the base uses\" to which things\r\nsacred may be turned. Had this excellent artist desired to satirize\r\ncertain popular theories of geology, he might have inscribed the stone\r\nto the memory of some philosopher who taught \"the permanency of existing\r\ncontinents\"--\"the era of repose\"--\"the impotence of modern causes.\"\r\n\r\nThe incursions of the sea at Aldborough, were formerly very destructive,\r\nand this borough is known to have been once situated a quarter of a mile\r\neast of the present shore. The inhabitants continued to build farther\r\ninland, till they arrived at the extremity of their property, and then\r\nthe town decayed greatly; but two sand-banks, thrown up at a short\r\ndistance, now afford a temporary safeguard to the coast. Between these\r\nbanks and the present shore, where the current now flows, the sea is\r\ntwenty-four feet deep on the spot where the town formerly stood.\r\n\r\n_Essex._--Harwich is said to have owed its rise to the destruction of\r\nOrwell, a town which stood on the spot now called \"the west rocks,\" and\r\nwas overwhelmed by an inroad of the sea since the Conquest.\r\nApprehensions have been entertained that the isthmus on which Harwich\r\nstands may at no remote period become an island, for the sea may be\r\nexpected to make a breach near Lower Dover Court, where Beacon Cliff is\r\ncomposed of horizontal beds of London clay containing septaria. It had\r\nwasted away considerably between the years 1829 and 1838, at both which\r\nperiods I examined this coast. In that short interval several gardens\r\nand many houses had been swept into the sea, and in April, 1838, a whole\r\nstreet was threatened with destruction. The advance of the sea is much\r\naccelerated by the traffic carried on in septaria, which are shipped off\r\nfor cement as fast as they fall down upon the beach. These stones, if\r\nallowed to remain in heaps on the shore, would break the force of the\r\nwaves and retard the conversion of the peninsula into an island, an\r\nevent which might be followed by the destruction of the town of Harwich.\r\nCaptain Washington, R. N., ascertained in 1847, that Beacon Cliff, above\r\nmentioned, which is about fifty feet high, had given way at the rate of\r\nforty feet in forty-seven years, between 1709 and 1756; eighty feet\r\nbetween 1756 and 1804; and three hundred and fifty feet between the\r\nlatter period and 1841; showing a rapidly accelerated rate of\r\ndestruction.[411]\r\n\r\nAmong other losses it is recorded that, since the year 1807, a field\r\ncalled the Vicar's Field, which belonged to the living of Harwich, has\r\nbeen overwhelmed;[412] and in the year 1820 there was a considerable\r\nspace between the battery at Harwich, built in the beginning of the\r\npresent century, and the sea; part of the fortification had been swept\r\naway in 1829, and the rest then overhung the water.\r\n\r\nAt Walton Naze, in the same county, the cliffs, composed of London clay,\r\ncapped by the shelly sands of the crag, reach the height of about 100\r\nfeet, and are annually undermined by the waves. The old churchyard of\r\nWalton has been washed away, and the cliffs to the south are constantly\r\ndisappearing.\r\n\r\n_Kent.--Isle of Sheppey._--On the coast bounding the estuary of the\r\nThames, there are numerous examples both of the gain and loss of land.\r\nThe Isle of Sheppey, which is now about six miles long by four in\r\nbreadth, is composed of London clay. The cliffs on the north, which are\r\nfrom sixty to eighty feet high, decay rapidly, fifty acres having been\r\nlost in twenty years, between 1810 and 1830. The church at Minster, now\r\nnear the coast, is said to have been in the middle of the island in\r\n1780; and if the present rate of destruction should continue, we might\r\ncalculate the period, and that not a very remote one, when the whole\r\nisland will be annihilated. On the coast of the mainland, to the east of\r\nSheppey, is Herne Bay: a place still retaining the name of a bay,\r\nalthough it is no longer appropriate, as the waves and currents have\r\nswept away the ancient headlands. There was formerly a small promontory\r\nin the line of the shoals where the present pier is built, by which the\r\nlarger bay was divided into two, called the Upper and Lower.[413]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.\r\n\r\nView of Reculver Church, taken in the year 1781.\r\n\r\n1. Isle of Sheppey. 2. Ancient chapel now destroyed. The cottage between\r\nthis chapel and the cliff was demolished by the sea, in 1782.]\r\n\r\nStill farther east stands the church of Reculver, upon a cliff composed\r\nof clay and sand, about twenty-five feet high. Reculver (Regulvium) was\r\nan important military station in the time of the Romans, and appears,\r\nfrom Leland's account, to have been, so late as Henry VIII.'s reign,\r\nnearly one mile distant from the sea. In the \"Gentleman's Magazine,\"\r\nthere is a view of it, taken in 1781, which still represents a\r\nconsiderable space as intervening between the north wall of the\r\nchurchyard and the cliff.[414] Sometime before the year 1780, the waves\r\nhad reached the site of the ancient Roman camp or fortification, the\r\nwalls of which had continued for several years after they were\r\nundermined to overhang the sea, being firmly cemented into one mass.\r\nThey were eighty yards nearer the sea than the church, and they are\r\nspoken of in the \"Topographica Britannica,\" in the year 1780, as having\r\nrecently fallen down. In 1804, part of the churchyard with some\r\nadjoining houses was washed away, and the ancient church, with its two\r\nspires, was dismantled and abandoned as a place of worship, but kept in\r\nrepair as a landmark well known to mariners. I visited the spot in June,\r\n1851, and saw human bones and part of a wooden coffin projecting from\r\nthe cliff, near the top. The whole building would probably have been\r\nswept away long ere this, had not the force of the waves been checked by\r\nan artificial causeway of stones and large wooden piles driven into the\r\nsands on the beach to break the force of the waves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.\r\n\r\nReculver Church, in 1834.]\r\n\r\n_Isle of Thanet._--The isle of Thanet was, in the time of the Romans,\r\nseparated from the rest of Kent by a navigable channel, through which\r\nthe Roman fleets sailed on their way to and from London. Bede describes\r\nthis small estuary as being, in the beginning of the eighth century,\r\nthree furlongs in breadth; and it is supposed that it began to grow\r\nshallow about the period of the Norman conquest. It was so far silted up\r\nin the year 1485, that an act was then obtained to build a bridge across\r\nit; and it has since become marsh land with small streams running\r\nthrough it. On the coast, Bedlam Farm, belonging to the hospital of that\r\nname, lost eight acres in the twenty years preceding 1830, the land\r\nbeing composed of chalk from forty to fifty feet above the level of the\r\nsea. It has been computed that the average waste of the cliff between\r\nthe North Foreland and the Reculvers, a distance of about eleven miles,\r\nis not less than two feet per annum. The chalk cliffs on the south of\r\nThanet, between Ramsgate and Pegwell Bay, have on an average lost three\r\nfeet per annum for the last ten years (preceding 1830).\r\n\r\n_Goodwin Sands._--The Goodwin Sands lie opposite this part of the\r\nKentish coast. They are about ten miles in length, and are in some parts\r\nthree, and in others seven, miles distant from the shore; and, for a\r\ncertain space, are laid bare at low water. That they are a remnant of\r\nland, and not \"a mere accumulation of sea sand,\" as Rennell\r\nimagined,[415] may be presumed from the fact that, when the erection of\r\na lighthouse on this shoal was in contemplation by the Trinity Board in\r\nthe year 1817, it was found, by borings, that the bank consisted of\r\nfifteen feet of sand, resting on blue clay; and, by subsequent borings,\r\nthe subjacent chalk has been reached. An obscure tradition has come down\r\nto us, that the estates of Earl Goodwin, the father of Harold, who died\r\nin the year 1053, were situated here, and some have conjectured that\r\nthey were overwhelmed by the flood mentioned in the Saxon chronicle,\r\n_sub anno 1099_. The last remains of an island, consisting, like\r\nSheppey, of clay, may perhaps have been carried away about that time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.\r\n\r\nShakspeare's Cliff in 1836, seen from the northeast.]\r\n\r\nThere are other records of waste in the county of Kent, as at Deal; and\r\nat Dover, where Shakspeare's Cliff, composed entirely of chalk, has\r\nsuffered greatly, and continually diminishes in height, the slope of the\r\nhill being towards the land. (See fig. 35.) There was an immense\r\nlandslip from this cliff in 1810, by which Dover was shaken as if by an\r\nearthquake, and a still greater one in 1772.[416] We may suppose,\r\ntherefore, that the view from the top of the precipice in the year 1600,\r\nwhen the tragedy of King Lear was written, was more \"fearful and dizzy\"\r\nthan it is now. The best antiquarian authorities are agreed, that Dover\r\nHarbor was formerly an estuary, the sea flowing up a valley between the\r\nchalk hills. The remains found in different excavations confirm the\r\ndescription of the spot given by Caesar and Antoninus, and there is clear\r\nhistorical evidence to prove that at an early period there was no\r\nshingle at all at Dover.[417]\r\n\r\n_Straits of Dover._--In proceeding from the northern parts of the German\r\nOcean towards the Straits of Dover, the water becomes gradually more\r\nshallow, so that, in the distance of about two hundred leagues, we pass\r\nfrom a depth of 120 to that of 58, 38, 18, and even less than 2 fathoms.\r\nThe shallowest part follows a line drawn between Romney Marsh and\r\nBoulogne. From this point the English Channel again deepens\r\nprogressively as we proceed westward, so that the Straits of Dover may\r\nbe said to part two seas.[418]\r\n\r\nWhether England was formerly united with France has often been a\r\nfavorite subject of speculation. So early as 1605 our countryman\r\nVerstegan, in his \"Antiquities of the English Nation,\" observed that\r\nmany preceding writers had maintained this opinion, but without\r\nsupporting it by any weighty reasons. He accordingly endeavors himself\r\nto confirm it by various arguments, the principal of which are, first,\r\nthe proximity and identity of the composition of the opposite cliffs and\r\nshores of Albion and Gallia, which, whether flat and sandy, or steep and\r\nchalky, correspond exactly with each other; secondly the occurrence of a\r\nsubmarine ridge, called \"our Lady's Sand,\" extending from shore to shore\r\nat no great depth, and which, from its composition, appears to be the\r\noriginal basis of the isthmus; thirdly, the identity of the noxious\r\nanimals in France and England, which could neither have swum across, nor\r\nhave been introduced by man. Thus no one, he says, would have imported\r\nwolves, therefore \"these wicked beasts did of themselves pass over.\" He\r\nsupposes the ancient isthmus to have been about six English miles in\r\nbreadth, composed entirely of chalk and flint, and in some places of no\r\ngreat height above the sea-level. The operation of the waves and tides,\r\nhe says, would have been more powerful when the straits were narrower,\r\nand even now they are destroying cliffs composed of similar materials.\r\nHe suggests the possible co-operation of earthquakes; and when we\r\nconsider how many submarine forests skirt the southern and eastern\r\nshores of England, and that there are raised beaches at many points\r\nabove the sea-level, containing fossil shells of recent species, it\r\nseems reasonable to suppose that such upward and downward movements,\r\ntaking place perhaps as slowly as those now in progress in Sweden and\r\nGreenland, may have greatly assisted the denuding force of \"the ocean\r\nstream,\" [Greek: Potamoio mega sthenos Ocheanoto].\r\n\r\n_Folkstone._--At Folkstone, the sea undermines the chalk and subjacent\r\nstrata. About the year 1716 there was a remarkable sinking of a tract of\r\nland near the sea, so that houses became visible from certain points at\r\nsea, and from particular spots on the sea cliffs, from whence they could\r\nnot be seen previously. In the description of this subsidence in the\r\nPhil. Trans. 1716, it is said, \"that the land consisted of a solid stony\r\nmass (chalk), resting on wet clay (gault), so that it slid forwards\r\ntowards the sea, just as a ship is launched on tallowed planks.\" It is\r\nalso stated that, within the memory of persons then living, the cliff\r\nthere had been washed away to the extent of ten rods.\r\n\r\nEncroachments of the sea at Hythe are also on record; but between this\r\npoint and Rye there has been a gain of land within the times of history;\r\nthe rich level tract called Romney Marsh, or Dungeness, about ten miles\r\nin width and five in breadth, and formed of silt, having received great\r\naccession. It has been necessary, however, to protect it from the sea,\r\nfrom the earliest periods, by embankments, the towns of Lydd and Romney\r\nbeing the only parts of the marsh above the level of the highest\r\ntides.[419] Mr. Redman has cited numerous old charts and trustworthy\r\nauthorities to prove that the average annual increase of the promontory\r\nof shingle called Dungeness amounted for two centuries, previous to\r\n1844, to nearly six yards. Its progress, however, has fluctuated during\r\nthat period; for between 1689 and 1794, a term of 105 years, the rate\r\nwas as much as 8-1/4 yards per annum.[420] It is ascertained that the\r\nshingle is derived from the westward. Whether the pebbles are stopped by\r\nthe meeting of the tide from the north flowing through the Straits of\r\nDover, with that which comes up the Channel from the west, as was\r\nformerly held, or by the check given to the tidal current by the waters\r\nof the Rother, as some maintain, is still a disputed question.\r\n\r\nRye, situated to the south of Romney Marsh, was once destroyed by the\r\nsea, but it is now two miles distant from it. The neighboring town of\r\nWinchelsea was destroyed in the reign of Edward I., the mouth of the\r\nRother stopped up, and the river diverted into another channel. In its\r\nold bed, an ancient vessel, apparently a Dutch merchantman, was found\r\nabout the year 1824. It was built entirely of oak, and much\r\nblackened.[421] Large quantities of hazel-nuts, peat, and wood are found\r\nin digging in Romney Marsh.\r\n\r\n_South coast of England._--Westward of Hastings, or of St. Leonard's,\r\nthe shore line has been giving way as far as Pevensey Bay, where\r\nformerly there existed a haven now entirely blocked up by shingle. The\r\ndegradation has equalled for a series of years seven feet per annum in\r\nsome places, and several martello towers had in consequence, before\r\n1851, been removed by the Ordnance.[422] At the promontory of Beachy\r\nHead a mass of chalk, three hundred feet in length, and from seventy to\r\neighty in breadth, fell in the year 1813 with a tremendous crash; and\r\nsimilar slips have since been frequent.[423]\r\n\r\nAbout a mile to the west of the town of Newhaven, the remains of an\r\nancient intrenchment are seen on the brow of Castle Hill. This\r\nearth-work, supposed to be Roman, was evidently once of considerable\r\nextent and of an oval form, but the greater part has been cut away by\r\nthe sea. The cliffs, which are undermined here, are high; more than one\r\nhundred feet of chalk being covered by tertiary clay and sand, from\r\nsixty to seventy feet in thickness. In a few centuries the last vestiges\r\nof the plastic clay formation on the southern borders of the chalk of\r\nthe South Downs on this coast will probably be annihilated, and future\r\ngeologists will learn, from historical documents, the ancient\r\ngeographical boundaries of this group of strata in that direction. On\r\nthe opposite side of the estuary of the Ouse, on the east of Newhaven\r\nharbor, a bed of shingle, composed of chalk flints derived from the\r\nwaste of the adjoining cliffs, had accumulated at Seaford for several\r\ncenturies. In the great storm of November, 1824, this bank was entirely\r\nswept away, and the town of Seaford inundated. Another great beach of\r\nshingle is now forming from fresh materials.\r\n\r\nThe whole coast of Sussex has been incessantly encroached upon by the\r\nsea from time immemorial; and, although sudden inundations only, which\r\noverwhelmed fertile or inhabited tracts, are noticed in history, the\r\nrecords attest an extraordinary amount of loss. During a period of no\r\nmore than eighty years, there are notices of about _twenty_ inroads, in\r\nwhich tracts of land of from twenty to _four hundred acres_ in extent\r\nwere overwhelmed at once, the value of the tithes being mentioned in the\r\nTaxatio Ecclesiastica.[424] In the reign of Elizabeth, the town of\r\nBrighton was situated on that tract where the chain pier now extends\r\ninto the sea. In the year 1665, twenty-two tenements had been destroyed\r\nunder the cliff. At that period there still remained under the cliff 113\r\ntenements, the whole of which were overwhelmed in 1703 and 1705. No\r\ntraces of the ancient town are now perceptible, yet there is evidence\r\nthat the sea has merely resumed its ancient position at the base of the\r\ncliffs, the site of the whole town having been merely a beach abandoned\r\nby the ocean for ages.\r\n\r\n_Hampshire.--Isle of Wight._--It would be endless to allude to all the\r\nlocalities on the Sussex and Hampshire coasts where the land has given\r\nway; but I may point out the relation which the geological structure of\r\nthe Isle of Wight bears to its present shape, as attesting that the\r\ncoast owes its outline to the continued action of the sea. Through the\r\nmiddle of the island runs a high ridge of chalk strata, in a vertical\r\nposition, and in a direction east and west. This chalk forms the\r\nprojecting promontory of Culver Cliff on the east, and of the Needles on\r\nthe west; while Sandown Bay on the one side, and Compton Bay on the\r\nother, have been hollowed out of the softer sands and argillaceous\r\nstrata, which are inferior, in geological position, to the chalk.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomena are repeated in the Isle of Purbeck, where the line\r\nof vertical chalk forms the projecting promontory of Handfast Point; and\r\nSwanage Bay marks the deep excavation made by the waves in the softer\r\nstrata, corresponding to those of Sandown Bay.\r\n\r\n_Hurst Castle bank--progressive motion of sea beaches._--Although the\r\nloose pebbles and grains of sand composing any given line of sea-beach\r\nare carried sometimes one way, sometimes another, they have,\r\nnevertheless, an ultimate motion in one particular direction.[425] Their\r\nprogress, for example, on the south coast of England, is from west to\r\neast, which is owing partly to the action of the waves driven eastwards\r\nby the prevailing wind, and partly to the current, or the motion of the\r\ngeneral body of water caused by the tides and winds. The force of the\r\nwaves gives motion to pebbles which the velocity of the currents alone\r\nwould be unable to carry forwards; but as the pebbles are finally\r\nreduced to sand or mud, by continual attrition, they are brought within\r\nthe influence of a current; and this cause must determine the course\r\nwhich the main body of matter derived from wasting cliffs will\r\neventually take.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from the observations of Mr. Palmer and others, that if a\r\npier or groin be erected anywhere on our southern or southeastern coast\r\nto stop the progress of the beach, a heap of shingle soon collects on\r\nthe western side of such artificial barriers. The pebbles continue to\r\naccumulate till they rise as high as the pier or groin, after which they\r\npour over in great numbers during heavy gales.[426]\r\n\r\nThe western entrance of the Channel, called the Solent, is crossed for\r\nmore than two-thirds of its width by the shingle-bank of Hurst Castle,\r\nwhich is about two miles long, seventy yards broad, and twelve feet\r\nhigh, presenting an inclined plane to the west. This singular bar\r\nconsists of a bed of rounded chalk flints, resting on a submarine\r\nargillaceous base. The flints and a few other pebbles, intermixed, are\r\nderived from the waste of Hordwell, and other cliffs to the westward,\r\nwhere tertiary strata, capped with a covering of broken chalk flints,\r\nfrom five to fifty feet thick, are rapidly undermined. In the great\r\nstorm of November, 1824, this bank of shingle was moved bodily forwards\r\nfor forty yards towards the northeast; and certain piles, which served\r\nto mark the boundaries of two manors, were found after the storm on the\r\nopposite side of the bar. At the same time many acres of pasture land\r\nwere covered by shingle, on the farm of Westover, near Lymington. But\r\nthe bar was soon restored in its old position by pebbles drifted from\r\nthe west; and it appears from ancient maps that it has preserved the\r\nsame general outline and position for centuries.[427]\r\n\r\nMr. Austen remarks that, as a general rule, it is only when high tides\r\nconcur with a gale of wind, that the sea reaches the base of cliffs so\r\nas to undermine them and throw down earth and stone. But the waves are\r\nperpetually employed in abrading and fashioning the materials already\r\nstrewed over the beach. Much of the gravel and shingle is always\r\ntravelling up and down, between high-water mark and a slight depth below\r\nthe level of the lowest tides, and occasionally the materials are swept\r\naway and carried into deeper water. Owing to these movements every\r\nportion of our southern coast may be seen at one time or other in the\r\ncondition of bare rock. Yet other beds of sand and shingle soon collect,\r\nand, although composed of new materials, invariably exhibit on the same\r\nspots precisely similar characters.[428]\r\n\r\nThe cliffs between Hurst Shingle Bar and Christchurch are undermined\r\ncontinually, the sea having often encroached for a series of years at\r\nthe rate of a yard annually. Within the memory of persons now living, it\r\nhas been necessary thrice to remove the coast-road farther inland. The\r\ntradition, therefore, is probably true, that the church of Hordwell was\r\nonce in the middle of that parish, although now (1830) very near the\r\nsea. The promontory of Christchurch Head gives way slowly. It is the\r\nonly point between Lymington and Poole Harbor, in Dorsetshire, where any\r\nhard stony masses occur in the cliffs. Five layers of large ferruginous\r\nconcretions, somewhat like the septaria of the London clay, have\r\noccasioned a resistance at this point, to which we may ascribe this\r\nheadland. In the mean time, the waves have cut deeply into the soft\r\nsands and loam of Poole Bay; and, after severe frosts, great landslips\r\ntake place, which by degrees become enlarged into narrow ravines, or\r\nchines, as they are called, with vertical sides. One of these chines,\r\nnear Boscomb, has been deepened twenty feet within a few years. At the\r\nhead of each there is a spring, the waters of which have been chiefly\r\ninstrumental in producing these narrow excavations, which are sometimes\r\nfrom 100 to 150 feet deep.\r\n\r\n_Isle of Portland._--The peninsulas of Purbeck and Portland are\r\ncontinually wasting away. In the latter, the soft argillaceous\r\nsubstratum (Kimmeridge clay) hastens the dilapidation of the\r\nsuperincumbent mass of limestone.\r\n\r\nIn 1655 the cliffs adjoining the principal quarries in Portland gave way\r\nto the extent of one hundred yards, and fell into the sea; and in\r\nDecember, 1734, a slide to the extent of 150 yards occurred on the east\r\nside of the isle, by which several skeletons buried between slabs of\r\nstone, were discovered. But a much more memorable occurrence of this\r\nnature, in 1792, occasioned probably by the undermining of the cliffs,\r\nis thus described in Hutchin's History of Dorsetshire:--\"Early in the\r\nmorning the road was observed to crack: this continued increasing, and\r\nbefore two o'clock the ground had sunk several feet, and was in one\r\ncontinued motion, but attended with no other noise than what was\r\noccasioned by the separation of the roots and brambles, and now and then\r\na falling rock. At night it seemed to stop a little, but soon moved\r\nagain; and, before morning, the ground from the top of the cliff to the\r\nwater-side had sunk in some places fifty feet perpendicular. The extent\r\nof ground that moved was about _a mile and a quarter_ from north to\r\nsouth, and 600 yards from east to west.\"\r\n\r\n_Formation of the Chesil Bank._--Portland is connected with the mainland\r\nby the Chesil Bank, a ridge of shingle about seventeen miles in length,\r\nand, in most places, nearly a quarter of a mile in breadth. The pebbles\r\nforming this immense barrier are chiefly siliceous, all loosely thrown\r\ntogether, and rising to the height of from twenty to thirty feet above\r\nthe ordinary high-water mark; and at the southeastern end, which is\r\nnearest the Isle of Portland, where the pebbles are largest, forty feet.\r\nThe fundamental rocks whereon the shingle rests are found at the depth\r\nof a few yards only below the level of the sea. The formation of that\r\npart of the bar which attaches Portland to the mainland may have been\r\ndue to an original shoal or reef, or to the set of the tides in the\r\nnarrow channel, by which the course of the pebbles, which are always\r\ncoming from the west, has been arrested. It is a singular fact that,\r\nthroughout the Chesil Bank, the pebbles increase gradually in size as we\r\nproceed southeastward, or as we go farther from the quarter which\r\nsupplied them. Had the case been reversed, we should naturally have\r\nattributed the circumstance to the constant wearing down of the pebbles\r\nby friction, as they are rolled along a beach seventeen miles in length.\r\nBut the true explanation of the phenomenon is doubtless this: the tidal\r\ncurrent runs strongest from west to east, and its power is greater in\r\nthe more open channel or farther from the land. In other words its force\r\nincreases southwards, and as the direction of the bank is from northwest\r\nto southeast, the size of the masses coming from the westward and thrown\r\nashore must always be largest where the motion of the water is most\r\nviolent. Colonel Reid states that all calcareous stones rolled along\r\nfrom the west are soon ground into sand, and in this form they pass\r\nround Portland Island.[429]\r\n\r\nThe storm of 1824 burst over the Chesil Bank with great fury, and the\r\nvillage of Chesilton, built upon its southern extremity, was\r\noverwhelmed, with many of the inhabitants. The same storm carried away\r\npart of the Breakwater at Plymouth, and huge masses of rock, from two to\r\nfive tons in weight, were lifted from the bottom of the weather side,\r\nand rolled fairly to the top of the pile. One block of limestone,\r\nweighing seven tons, was washed round the western extremity of the\r\nBreakwater, and carried 150 feet.[430] The propelling power is derived\r\nin these cases from the breaking of the waves, which run fastest in\r\nshallow water, and for a short space far exceed the most rapid currents\r\nin swiftness. It was in the same month, and also during a spring-tide,\r\nthat a great flood is mentioned on the coasts of England, in the year\r\n1099. Florence of Worcester says, \"On the third day of the nones of Nov.\r\n1099, the sea came out upon the shore and buried towns and men very\r\nmany, and oxen and sheep innumerable.\" We also read in the Saxon\r\nChronicle, for the year 1099, \"This year eke on St. Martin's mass day,\r\nthe 11th of Novembre, sprung up so much of the sea flood, and so myckle\r\nharm did, as no man minded that it ever afore did, and there was the ylk\r\nday a new moon.\"\r\n\r\nSouth of the Bill, or southern point of Portland, is a remarkable shoal\r\nin the channel at the depth of seven fathoms, called \"the Shambles,\"\r\nconsisting entirely of rolled and broken shells of Purpura lapillus,\r\nMytilus edulis, and other species now living. This mass of light\r\nmaterials is always in motion, varying in height from day to day, and\r\nyet the shoal remains constant.\r\n\r\n_Dorsetshire.--Devonshire._--At Lyme Regis, in Dorsetshire, the \"Church\r\nCliffs,\" as they are called, consisting of lias about one hundred feet\r\nin height, gradually fell away at the rate of one yard a year, from 1800\r\nto 1829.[431]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.\r\n\r\nLandslip, near Axmouth, Dec. 1839.

New reef upheaved from the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary landslip occurred on the 24th of December, 1839, on the\r\ncoast between Lyme Regis and Axmouth, which has been described by the\r\nRev. W. D. Conybeare, to whose kindness I am indebted for the\r\naccompanying section, fig. 36. The tract of downs ranging there along\r\nthe coast is capped by chalk (_h_), which rests on sandstone,\r\nalternating with chert (_i_), beneath which is more than 100 feet of\r\nloose sand (_k_), with concretions at the bottom, and belonging like _i_\r\nto the green-sand formation; the whole of the above masses, _h_, _i_,\r\n_k_, reposing on retentive beds of clay (_l_), belonging to the lias,\r\nwhich shelves towards the sea. Numerous springs issuing from the loose\r\nsand (_k_), have gradually removed portions of it, and thus undermined\r\nthe superstratum, so as to have caused subsidences at former times, and\r\nto have produced a line of undercliff between D and E. In 1839 an\r\nexcessively wet season had saturated all the rocks with moisture, so as\r\nto increase the weight of the incumbent mass, from which the support had\r\nalready been withdrawn by the action of springs. Thus the superstrata\r\nwere precipitated into hollows prepared for them, and the adjacent\r\nmasses of partially undermined rock, to which the movement was\r\ncommunicated, were made to slide down on a slippery basis of watery sand\r\ntowards the sea. These causes gave rise to a convulsion, which began on\r\nthe morning of the 24th of December, with a crashing noise; and, on the\r\nevening of the same day, fissures were seen opening in the ground, and\r\nthe walls of tenements rending and sinking, until a deep chasm or\r\nravine, B, was formed, extending nearly three-quarters of a mile in\r\nlength, with a depth of from 100 to 150 feet, and a breadth exceeding\r\n240 feet. At the bottom of this deep gulf lie fragments of the original\r\nsurface thrown together in the wildest confusion. In consequence of\r\nlateral movements, the tract intervening between the new fissure and the\r\nsea, including the ancient undercliff, was fractured, and the whole line\r\nof sea-cliff carried bodily forwards for many yards. \"A remarkable\r\npyramidal crag, F, off Culverhole Point, which lately formed a\r\ndistinguishing landmark, has sunk from a height of about seventy to\r\ntwenty feet, and the main cliff, E, before more than fifty feet distant\r\nfrom this insulated crag, is now brought almost close to it. This motion\r\nof the sea-cliff has produced a farther effect, which may rank among the\r\nmost striking phenomena of this catastrophe. The lateral pressure of the\r\ndescending rocks has urged the neighboring strata, extending beneath the\r\nshingle of the shore, by their state of unnatural condensation, to burst\r\nupwards in a line parallel to the coast--thus an elevated ridge, G, more\r\nthan a mile in length, and rising more than forty feet, covered by a\r\nconfused assemblage of broken strata, and immense blocks of rock,\r\ninvested with sea-weed and corallines, and scattered over with shells\r\nand star-fish, and other productions of the deep, forms an extended reef\r\nin front of the present range of cliffs.\"[432]\r\n\r\nA full account of this remarkable landslip, with a plan, sections, and\r\nmany fine illustrative drawings, was published by Messrs. Conybeare and\r\nBuckland,[433] from one of which the annexed cut has been reduced, fig.\r\n37.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.\r\n\r\nView of the Axmouth landslip from Great Bindon, looking westward to the\r\nSidmouth hills, and estuary of the Exe. From an original drawing by Mrs.\r\nBuckland.]\r\n\r\n_Cornwall._--Near Penzance, in Cornwall, there is a projecting tongue of\r\nland, called the \"Green,\" formed of granitic sand, from which more than\r\nthirty acres of pasture land have been gradually swept away, in the\r\ncourse of the last two or three centuries.[434] It is also said that St.\r\nMichael's Mount, now an insular rock, was formerly situated in a wood,\r\nseveral miles from the sea; and its old Cornish name (Caraclowse in\r\nCowse) signifies, according to Carew, the Hoar Rock in the wood.[435]\r\nBetween the Mount and Newlyn there is seen under the sand, black\r\nvegetable mould, full of hazel-nuts, and the branches, leaves, roots,\r\nand trunks of forest-trees, all of indigenous species. This stratum has\r\nbeen traced seaward as far as the ebb permits, and many proofs of a\r\nsubmerged vegetable accumulation, with stumps of trees in the position\r\nin which they grew, have been traced, says Sir Henry De la Beche, round\r\nthe shores of Devon, Cornwall, and Western Somerset. The facts not only\r\nindicate a change in the relative level of the sea and land, since the\r\nspecies of animals and plants were the same as those now living in this\r\ndistrict; but, what is very remarkable, there seems evidence of the\r\nsubmergence having been effected, in part at least, since the country\r\nwas inhabited by man.[436]\r\n\r\nA submarine forest occurring at the mouth of the Parret in\r\nSomersetshire, on the south side of the Bristol Channel, was described\r\nby Mr. L. Horner, in 1815, and its position attributed to subsidence. A\r\nbed of peat is there seen below the level of the sea, and the trunks of\r\nlarge trees, such as the oak and yew, having their roots still\r\ndiverging as they grew, and fixed in blue clay.[437]\r\n\r\n_Tradition of loss of land in Cornwall._--The oldest historians mention\r\na tradition in Cornwall, of the submersion of the Lionnesse, a country\r\nsaid to have stretched from the Land's End to the Scilly Islands. The\r\ntract, if it existed, must have been thirty miles in length, and perhaps\r\nten in breadth. The land now remaining on either side is from two\r\nhundred to three hundred feet high; the intervening sea about three\r\nhundred feet deep. Although there is no authentic evidence for this\r\nromantic tale, it probably originated in some former inroads of the\r\nAtlantic, accompanying, perhaps, a subsidence of land on this\r\ncoast.[438]\r\n\r\n_West coast of England._--Having now brought together an ample body of\r\nproofs of the destructive operations of the waves, tides, and currents,\r\non our eastern and southern shores, it will be unnecessary to enter into\r\ndetails of changes on the western coast, for they present merely a\r\nrepetition of the same phenomena, and in general on an inferior scale.\r\nOn the borders of the estuary of the Severn the flats of Somersetshire\r\nand Gloucestershire have received enormous accessions, while, on the\r\nother hand, the coast of Cheshire, between the rivers Mersey and Dee,\r\nhas lost, since the year 1764, many hundred yards, and some affirm more\r\nthan half a mile, by the advance of the sea upon the abrupt cliffs of\r\nred clay and marls. Within the period above mentioned several\r\nlighthouses have been successively abandoned.[439] There are traditions\r\nin Pembrokeshire[440] and Cardiganshire[441] of far greater losses of\r\nterritory than that which the Lionnesse tale of Cornwall pretends to\r\ncommemorate. They are all important, as demonstrating that the earliest\r\ninhabitants were familiar with the phenomenon of incursions of the sea.\r\n\r\n_Loss of land on the coast of France._--The French coast, particularly\r\nthat part of Brittany, where the tides rise to an extraordinary height,\r\nis the constant prey of the waves. In the ninth century many villages\r\nand woods are reported to have been carried away, the coast undergoing\r\ngreat change, whereby the hill of St. Michael was detached from the\r\nmainland. The parish of Bourgneuf, and several others in that\r\nneighborhood, were overflowed in the year 1500. In 1735, during a great\r\nstorm, the ruins of Palnel were seen uncovered in the sea.[442]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nACTION OF TIDES AND CURRENTS--_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Inroads of the sea at the mouths of the Rhine in Holland--Changes in\r\n    the arms of the Rhine--Proofs of subsidence of land--Estuary of the\r\n    Bies Bosoh, formed in 1421--Zuyder Zee, in the 13th century--Islands\r\n    destroyed--Delta of the Ems converted into a bay--Estuary of the\r\n    Dollart formed--Encroachment of the sea on the coast of Sleswick--On\r\n    shores of North America--Tidal wave, called the Bore--Influence of\r\n    tides and currents on the mean level of seas--Action of currents in\r\n    inland lakes and seas--Baltic--Cimbrian deluge--Straits of\r\n    Gibraltar--No under-current there--Whether salt is precipitated in\r\n    the Mediterranean--Waste of shores of Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inroads of the sea at the mouths of the Rhine._--The line of British\r\ncoast considered in the preceding chapter offered no example of the\r\nconflict of two great antagonist forces; the influx, on the one hand, of\r\na river draining a large continent, and, on the other, the action of the\r\nwaves, tides, and currents of the ocean. But when we pass over by the\r\nStraits of Dover to the Continent, and proceed northeastwards, we find\r\nan admirable illustration of such a contest, where the ocean and the\r\nRhine are opposed to each other, each disputing the ground now occupied\r\nby Holland; the one striving to shape out an estuary, the other to form\r\na delta. There was evidently a period when the river obtained the\r\nascendancy, when the shape and perhaps the relative level of the coast\r\nand set of the tides were very different; but for the last two thousand\r\nyears, during which man has witnessed and actively participated in the\r\nstruggle, the result has been in favor of the ocean; the area of the\r\nwhole territory having become more and more circumscribed; natural and\r\nartificial barriers having given away, one after another; and many\r\nhundred thousand human beings having perished in the waves.\r\n\r\n_Changes in the arms of the Rhine._--The Rhine, after flowing from the\r\nGrison Alps, copiously charged with sediment, first purifies itself in\r\nthe Lake of Constance, where a large delta is formed; then swelled by\r\nthe Aar and numerous other tributaries, it flows for more than six\r\nhundred miles towards the north; when, entering a low tract, it divides\r\ninto two arms, about ten miles northeast of Cleves,--a point which must\r\ntherefore be considered the head of its delta. (See[A], map, fig. 8.)\r\nIn speaking of the delta, I do not mean to assume that all that part of\r\nHolland which is comprised within the several arms of the Rhine can be\r\ncalled a delta in the strictest sense of the term; because some portion\r\nof the country thus circumscribed, as, for example, a part of Gelderland\r\nand Utrecht, consists of strata which may have been deposited in the sea\r\nbefore the Rhine existed. These older tracts may either have been raised\r\nlike the Ullah Bund in Cutch, during the period when the sediment of\r\nthe Rhine was converting a part of the sea into land, or they may have\r\nconstituted islands previously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.\r\n\r\nThe dark tint between Antwerp and Nieuport, represents part of the\r\nNetherlands which was land in the time of the Romans, then overflowed by\r\nthe sea before and during the 5th century, and afterwards reconverted\r\ninto land.]\r\n\r\nWhen the river divides north of Cleves, the left arm takes the name of\r\nthe Waal; and the right, retaining that of the Rhine, is connected, a\r\nlittle farther to the north, by an artificial canal with the river\r\nYssel. The Rhine then flowing westward divides again southeast of\r\nUtrecht, and from this point it takes the name of the Leck, a name which\r\nwas given to distinguish it from the northern arm called the old Rhine,\r\nwhich was sanded up until the year 1825, when a channel was cut for it,\r\nby which it now enters the sea at Catwyck. It is common, in all great\r\ndeltas, that the principal channels of discharge should shift from time\r\nto time, but in Holland so many magnificent canals have been\r\nconstructed, and have so diverted, from time to time, the course of the\r\nwaters, that the geographical changes in this delta are endless, and\r\ntheir history, since the Roman era, forms a complicated topic of\r\nantiquarian research. The present head of the delta is about forty\r\ngeographical miles from the nearest part of the gulf called the Zuyder\r\nZee, and more than twice that distance from the general coast-line. The\r\npresent head of the delta of the Nile is about 80 or 90 geographical\r\nmiles from the sea; that of the Ganges, as before stated, 220; and that\r\nof the Mississippi about 180, reckoning from the point where the\r\nAtchafalaya branches off to the extremity of the new tongue of land in\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico. But the comparative distance between the heads of\r\ndeltas and the sea affords no positive data for estimating the relative\r\nmagnitude of the alluvial tracts formed by their respective rivers, for\r\nthe ramifications depend on many varying and temporary circumstances,\r\nand the area over which they extend does not hold any constant\r\nproportion to the volume of water in the river.\r\n\r\nThe Rhine therefore has at present three mouths. About two-thirds of its\r\nwaters flow to the sea by the Waal, and the remainder is carried partly\r\nto the Zuyder Zee by the Yssel, and partly to the ocean by the Leck. As\r\nthe whole coast to the south as far as Ostend, and on the north to the\r\nentrance of the Baltic, has, with few exceptions, from time immemorial,\r\nyielded to the force of the waves, it is evident that the common delta\r\nof the Rhine, Meuse, and Scheldt, for these three rivers may all be\r\nconsidered as discharging their waters into the same part of the sea,\r\nwould, if its advance had not been checked, have become extremely\r\nprominent; and even if it had remained stationary, would long ere this\r\nhave projected far beyond the rounded outline of the coast, like that\r\nstrip of land already described at the mouth of the Mississippi. But we\r\nfind, on the contrary, that the islands which skirt the coast have not\r\nonly lessened in size, but in number also, while great bays have been\r\nformed in the interior by incursions of the sea.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain the incessant advance of the ocean on the shores and\r\ninland country of Holland, M. E. de Beaumont has suggested that there\r\nhas in all probability been a general depression or sinking of the land\r\nbelow its former level over a wide area. Such a change of level would\r\nenable the sea to break through the ancient line of sand-banks and\r\nislands which protected the coast,--would lead to the enlargement of\r\nbays, the formation of new estuaries, and ultimately to the entire\r\nsubmergence of land. These views appear to be supported by the fact that\r\nseveral peat-mosses of fresh-water origin now occur under the level of\r\nthe sea, especially on the site of the Zuyder Zee and Lake Flevo,\r\npresently to be mentioned. Several excavations also made for wells at\r\nUtrecht, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam have proved, that below the level of\r\nthe ocean, the soil near the coast consists of alternations of sand with\r\nmarine shells, and beds of peat and clay, which have been traced to the\r\ndepth of fifty feet and upwards.[443]\r\n\r\nI have said that the coast to the south as far as Ostend has given way.\r\nThis statement may at first seem opposed to the fact, that the tract\r\nbetween Antwerp and Nieuport, shaded black in the annexed map (fig. 38),\r\nalthough now dry land, and supporting a large population, has, within\r\nthe historical period, been covered with the sea. This region, however,\r\nconsisted, in the time of the Romans, of woods, marshes, and\r\npeat-mosses, protected from the ocean by a chain of sandy dunes, which\r\nwere afterwards broken through during storms, especially in the fifth\r\ncentury. The waters of the sea during these irruptions threw down upon\r\nthe barren peat a horizontal bed of fertile clay, which is in some\r\nplaces three yards thick, full of recent shells and works of art. The\r\ninhabitants, by the aid of embankments and the sand dunes of the coast,\r\nhave succeeded, although not without frequent disasters, in defending\r\nthe soil thus raised by the marine deposit.[444]\r\n\r\n_Inroads of the Sea in Holland._--If we pass to the northward of the\r\nterritory just alluded to, and cross the Scheldt, we find that between\r\nthe fourteenth and eighteenth centuries parts of the islands Walcheren\r\nand Beveland were swept away, and several populous districts of Kadzand,\r\nlosses which far more than counterbalance the gain of land caused by the\r\nsanding up of some pre-existing creeks. In 1658 the Island Orisant was\r\nannihilated. One of the most memorable inroads of the sea occurred in\r\n1421, when the tide, pouring into the mouth of the united Meuse and\r\nWaal, burst through a dam in the district between Dort and\r\nGertrudenberg, and overflowed seventy-two villages, forming a large\r\nsheet of water called the Bies Bosch. (See map, fig. 38.) Thirty-five of\r\nthe villages were irretrievably lost, and no vestige, even of their\r\nruins, was afterwards seen. The rest were redeemed, and the site of the\r\nothers, though still very generally represented on maps as an estuary,\r\nhas in fact been gradually filled up by alluvial deposits, and had\r\nbecome in 1835, as I was informed by Professor Moll, an immense plain,\r\nyielding abundant crops of hay, though still uninhabited. To the north\r\nof the Meuse is a long line of shore covered with sand dunes, where\r\ngreat encroachments have taken place from time to time, in consequence\r\nchiefly of the prevalence of southeasterly winds, which blow down the\r\nsands towards the sea. The church of Scheveningen, not far from the\r\nHague, was once in the middle of the village, and now stands on the\r\nshore, half the place having been overwhelmed by the waves in 1570.\r\nCatwyck, once far from the sea, is now upon the shore; two of its\r\nstreets having been overflowed, and land torn away to the extent of 200\r\nyards, in 1719. It is only by the aid of embankments that Petten, and\r\nseveral other places farther north, have been defended against the sea.\r\n\r\n_Formation of the Zuyder Zee and Straits of Staveren._--Still more\r\nimportant are the changes which have taken place on the coast opposite\r\nthe right arm of the Rhine, or the Yssel, where the ocean has burst\r\nthrough a large isthmus, and entered the inland lake Flevo, which, in\r\nancient times, was, according to Pomponius Mela, formed by the\r\noverflowing of the Rhine over certain lowlands. It appears that, in the\r\ntime of Tacitus, there were several lakes on the present site of the\r\nZuyder Zee, between Friesland and Holland. The successive inroads by\r\nwhich these and a great part of the adjoining territory, were\r\ntransformed into a great gulf, began about the commencement, and were\r\ncompleted towards the close, of the thirteenth century. Alting gives the\r\nfollowing relation of the occurrence, drawn from manuscript documents of\r\ncontemporary inhabitants of the neighboring provinces. In the year\r\n1205, the island now called Wieringen, to the south of the Texel, was\r\nstill a part of the mainland, but during several high floods, of which\r\nthe dates are given, ending in December, 1251, it was separated from the\r\ncontinent. By subsequent incursions the sea consumed great parts of the\r\nrich and populous isthmus, a low tract which stretched on the north of\r\nLake Flevo, between Staveren in Friesland and Medemblick in Holland,\r\ntill at length a breach was completed about the year 1282, and\r\nafterwards widened. Great destruction of land took place when the sea\r\nfirst broke in, and many towns were swept away; but there was afterwards\r\na reaction to a certain extent, large tracts, at first submerged, having\r\nbeen gradually redeemed. The new straits south of Staveren are more than\r\nhalf the width of those of Dover, but are very shallow, the greatest\r\ndepth not exceeding two or three fathoms. The new bay is of a somewhat\r\ncircular form, and between _thirty_ and _forty_ miles in diameter. How\r\nmuch of this space may formerly have been occupied by Lake Flevo is\r\nunknown. (See map, fig. 38.)\r\n\r\n_Destruction of islands._--A series of islands stretching from the Texel\r\nto the mouths of the Weser and Elbe are probably the last relics of a\r\ntract once continuous. They have greatly diminished in size, and have\r\nlost about a third of their number, since the time of Pliny; for that\r\nnaturalist counted twenty-three islands between the Texel and Eider,\r\nwhereas there are now only sixteen, including Heligoland and\r\nNeuwerk.[445] The island of Heligoland, at the mouth of the Elbe,\r\nconsists of a rock of red marl of the Keuper formation (of the Germans),\r\nand is bounded by perpendicular red cliffs, above 200 feet high.\r\nAlthough, according to some accounts, it has been greatly reduced in\r\nsize since the year 800, M. Wiebel assures us, that the ancient map by\r\nMeyer cannot be depended upon, and that the island, according to the\r\ndescription still extant by Adam of Bremen, was not much larger than\r\nnow, in the time of Charlemagne. On comparing the map made in the year\r\n1793 by the Danish engineer Wessel, the average encroachment of the sea\r\non the cliffs, between that period and the year 1848 (or about half a\r\ncentury), did not amount to more than three feet.[446] On the other\r\nhand, some few islands have extended their bounds in one direction, or\r\nbecome connected with others, by the sanding-up of channels; but even\r\nthese, like Juist, have generally given way as much on the north towards\r\nthe sea as they have gained on the south, or land side.\r\n\r\n_The Dollart formed._--While the delta of the Rhine has suffered so\r\nmaterially from the movements of the ocean, it can hardly be supposed\r\nthat minor rivers on the same coast should have been permitted to extend\r\ntheir deltas. It appears that in the time of the Romans there was an\r\nalluvial plain of great fertility, where the Ems entered the sea by\r\nthree arms. This low country stretched between Groningen and Friesland,\r\nand sent out a peninsula to the northeast towards Emden. A flood in 1277\r\nfirst destroyed part of the peninsula. Other inundations followed at\r\ndifferent periods throughout the fifteenth century. In 1507, a part only\r\nof Torum, a considerable town, remained standing; and in spite of the\r\nerection of dams, the remainder of that place, together with\r\nmarket-towns, villages, and monasteries, to the number of fifty, were\r\nfinally overwhelmed. The new gulf, which was called the Dollart,\r\nalthough small in comparison to the Zuyder Zee, occupied no less than\r\nsix square miles at first; but part of this space was, in the course of\r\nthe two following centuries, again redeemed from the sea. The small bay\r\nof Leybucht, farther north, was formed in a similar manner in the\r\nthirteenth century; and the bay of Harlbucht in the middle of the\r\nsixteenth. Both of these have since been partially reconverted into dry\r\nland. Another new estuary, called the Gulf of Jahde, near the mouth of\r\nthe Weser, scarcely inferior in size to the Dollart, has been gradually\r\nhollowed out since the year 1016, between which era and 1651 a space of\r\nabout four square miles has been added to the sea. The rivulet which now\r\nenters this inlet is very small; but Arens conjectures that an arm of\r\nthe Weser had once an outlet in that direction.\r\n\r\n_Coast of Sleswick._--Farther north we find so many records of waste on\r\nthe western coast of Sleswick, as to lead us to anticipate that, at no\r\ndistant period in the history of the physical geography of Europe,\r\nJutland may become an island, and the ocean may obtain a more direct\r\nentrance into the Baltic. Indeed, the temporary insulation of the\r\nnorthern extremity of Jutland has been affected no less than four times\r\nwithin the records of history, the ocean having as often made a breach\r\nthrough the bar of sand, which usually excludes it from the Lym Fiord.\r\nThis long frith is 120 miles in length including its windings, and\r\ncommunicates at its eastern end with the Baltic. The last irruption of\r\nsalt water happened in 1824, and the fiord was still open in 1837, when\r\nsome vessels of thirty tons' burden passed through.\r\n\r\nThe Marsh islands between the rivers Elbe and Eider are mere banks, like\r\nthe lands formed of the \"warp\" in the Humber, protected by dikes. Some\r\nof them, after having been inhabited with security for more than ten\r\ncenturies, have been suddenly overwhelmed. In this manner, in 1216, no\r\nless than ten thousand of the inhabitants of Eiderstede and Ditmarsch\r\nperished; and on the 11th of October, 1634, the islands and the whole\r\ncoast, as far as Jutland, suffered by a dreadful deluge.\r\n\r\n_Destruction of Northstrand by the sea._--Northstrand, up to the year\r\n1240, was, with the islands Sylt and Fohr, so nearly connected with the\r\nmainland as to appear a peninsula, and was called North Friesland, a\r\nhighly cultivated and populous district. It measured from nine to eleven\r\ngeographical miles from north to south, and six to eight from east to\r\nwest. In the above-mentioned year it was torn asunder from the\r\ncontinent, and in part overwhelmed. The Isle of Northstrand, thus\r\nformed, was, towards the end of the sixteenth century, only four\r\ngeographical miles in circumference, and was still celebrated for its\r\ncultivation and numerous population. After many losses, it still\r\ncontained nine thousand inhabitants. At last, in the year 1634, on the\r\nevening of the 11th of October, a flood passed over the whole island,\r\nwhereby 1300 houses, with many churches, were lost; fifty thousand head\r\nof cattle perished, and above six thousand men. Three small islets, one\r\nof them still called Northstrand, alone remained, which are now\r\ncontinually wasting.\r\n\r\nThe redundancy of river water in the Baltic, especially during the\r\nmelting of ice and snow in spring, causes in general an outward current\r\nthrough the channel called the Cattegat. But after a continuance of\r\nnorthwesterly gales, especially during the height of the spring-tides,\r\nthe Atlantic rises, and pouring a flood of water into the Baltic,\r\ncommits dreadful devastations on the isles of the Danish Archipelago.\r\nThis current even acts, though with diminished force, as far eastward as\r\nthe vicinity of Dantzic.[447] Accounts written during the last ten\r\ncenturies attest the wearing down of promontories on the Danish coast,\r\nthe deepening of gulfs, the severing of peninsulas from the mainland,\r\nand the waste of islands, while in several cases marsh land, defended\r\nfor centuries by dikes, has at last been overflowed, and thousands of\r\nthe inhabitants whelmed in the waves. Thus the island Barsoe, on the\r\ncoast of Sleswick, has lost, year after year, an acre at a time, and the\r\nisland Alsen suffers in like manner.\r\n\r\n_Cimbrian deluge._--As we have already seen that during the flood before\r\nmentioned, 6000 men and 50,000 head of cattle perished on Northstrand on\r\nthe western coast of Jutland, we are all well prepared to find that this\r\npeninsula, the Cimbrica Chersonesus of the ancients, has from a remote\r\nperiod been the theatre of like catastrophes. Accordingly, Strabo\r\nrecords a story, although he treats it as an incredible fiction, that,\r\nduring a high tide, the ocean rose upon this coast so rapidly, that men\r\non horseback were scarcely able to escape.[448] Florus, alluding to the\r\nsame tradition, says, \"Cimbri, Teutoni, atque Tigurini, ab extremis\r\nGalliae profugi, cum terras eorum inundasset Oceanus, novas sedes toto\r\norbe quaerebant.\"[449] This event, commonly called the \"Cimbrian Deluge,\"\r\nis supposed to have happened about three centuries before the Christian\r\nera; but it is not improbable that the principal catastrophe was\r\npreceded and followed by many devastations like those experienced in\r\nmodern times on the islands and shores of Jutland, and such calamities\r\nmay well be conceived to have forced on the migration of some maritime\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\n_Inroads of the sea on the eastern shores of North America._--After so\r\nmany authentic details respecting the destruction of the coast in parts\r\nof Europe best known, it will be unnecessary to multiply examples of\r\nanalogous changes in more distant regions of the world. It must not,\r\nhowever, be imagined that our own seas form any exception to the general\r\nrule. Thus, for example, if we pass over to the eastern coast of North\r\nAmerica, where the tides rise, in the Bay of Fundy, to a great\r\nelevation, we find many facts attesting the incessant demolition of\r\nland. Cliffs, often several hundred feet high, composed of sandstone,\r\nred marl, and other rocks, which border that bay and its numerous\r\nestuaries, are perpetually undermined. The ruins of these cliffs are\r\ngradually carried, in the form of mud, sand, and large boulders, into\r\nthe Atlantic by powerful currents, aided at certain seasons by drift\r\nice, which forms along the coast, and freezes round large stones.\r\n\r\nAt Cape May, on the north side of Delaware Bay, in the United States,\r\nthe encroachment of the sea was shown by observations made consecutively\r\nfor sixteen years, from 1804 to 1820, to average about nine feet a\r\nyear;[450] and at Sullivan's Island, which lies on the north side of the\r\nentrance of the harbor of Charleston, in South Carolina, the sea carried\r\naway a quarter of a mile of land in three years, ending in 1786.[451]\r\n\r\n_Tidal wave called \"the Bore.\"_--Before concluding my remarks on the\r\naction of the tides, I must not omit to mention the wave called \"the\r\nBore,\" which is sometimes produced in a river where a large body of\r\nwater is made to rise suddenly, in consequence of the contraction of the\r\nchannel. This wave terminates abruptly on the inland side; because the\r\nquantity of water contained in it is so great, and its motion so rapid,\r\nthat time is not allowed for the surface of the river to be immediately\r\nraised by means of transmitted pressure. A tide wave thus rendered\r\nabrupt has a close analogy, observes Mr. Whewell, to the waves which\r\ncurl over and break on a shelving shore.[452]\r\n\r\nThe Bore which enters the Severn, where the phenomenon is of almost\r\ndaily occurrence, is sometimes nine feet high, and at spring-tides\r\nrushes up the estuary with extraordinary rapidity. The finest example\r\nwhich I have seen of this wave was at Nova Scotia,[453] where the tide\r\nis said to rise in some places seventy feet perpendicular, and to be the\r\nhighest in the world. In the large estuary of the Shubenacadie, which\r\nconnects with another estuary called the Basin of Mines, itself an\r\nembranchment of the Bay of Fundy, a vast body of water comes rushing up,\r\nwith a roaring noise, into a long narrow channel, and while it is\r\nascending, has all the appearance of pouring down a slope as steep as\r\nthat of the celebrated rapids of the St. Lawrence. In picturesque\r\neffect, however, it bears no comparison, for instead of the transparent\r\ngreen water and snow-white foam of the St. Lawrence, the whole current\r\nof the Shubenacadie is turbid and densely charged with red mud. The same\r\nphenomenon is frequently witnessed in the principal branches of the\r\nGanges and in the Megna as before mentioned (p. 279). \"In the Hoogly,\"\r\nsays Rennell, \"the Bore commences at Hoogly Point, the place where the\r\nriver first contracts itself, and is perceptible above Hoogly Town; and\r\nso quick is its motion, that it hardly employs four hours in travelling\r\nfrom one to the other, though the distance is nearly seventy miles. At\r\nCalcutta it sometimes occasions an instantaneous rise of five feet; and\r\nboth here, and in every other part of its track, the boats, on its\r\napproach, immediately quit the shore, and make for safety to the middle\r\nof the river. In the channels, between the islands in the mouth of the\r\nMegna, the height of the Bore is said to exceed twelve feet; and is so\r\nterrific in its appearance, and dangerous in its consequences, that no\r\nboat will venture to pass at spring-tide.\"[454] These waves may\r\nsometimes cause inundations, undermine cliffs, and still more frequently\r\nsweep away trees and land animals from low shores, so that they may be\r\ncarried down, and ultimately imbedded in fluviatile or submarine\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRENTS IN INLAND LAKES AND SEAS.\r\n\r\nIn such large bodies of water as the North American lakes, the\r\ncontinuance of a strong wind in one direction often causes the elevation\r\nof the water, and its accumulation on the leeward side; and while the\r\nequilibrium is restoring itself, powerful currents are occasioned. In\r\nOctober, 1833, a strong current in Lake Erie, caused partly by the set\r\nof the waters towards the outlet of the lake, and partly by the\r\nprevailing wind, burst a passage through the extensive peninsula called\r\nLong Point, and soon excavated a channel more than nine feet deep and\r\nnine hundred feet wide. Its width and depth have since increased, and a\r\nnew and costly pier has been erected; for it is hoped that this event\r\nwill permanently improve the navigation of Lake Erie for\r\nsteamboats.[455] On the opposite, or southern coast of this lake, in\r\nfront of the town of Cleveland, the degradation of the cliffs had been\r\nso rapid for several years preceding a survey made in 1837, as to\r\nthreaten many towns with demolition.[456] In the Black Sea, also,\r\nalthough free from tides, we learn from Pallas that there is a\r\nsufficiently strong current to undermine the cliffs in many parts, and\r\nparticularly in the Crimea.\r\n\r\n_Straits of Gibraltar._--It is well known that a powerful current sets\r\nconstantly from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean, and its influence\r\nextends along the whole southern borders of that sea, and even to the\r\nshores of Asia Minor. Captain Smyth found, during his survey, that the\r\ncentral current ran constantly at the rate of from three to six miles an\r\nhour eastward into the Mediterranean, the body of water being three\r\nmiles and a half wide. But there are also two lateral currents--one on\r\nthe European, and one on the African side; each of them about two miles\r\nand a half broad, and flowing at about the same rate as the central\r\nstream. These lateral currents ebb and flow with the tide, setting\r\nalternately into the Mediterranean and into the Atlantic. The excess of\r\nwater constantly flowing in is very great, and there is only one cause\r\nto which this can be attributed, the loss of water in the Mediterranean\r\nby evaporation. That the level of this sea should be considerably\r\ndepressed by this cause is quite conceivable, since we know that the\r\nwinds blowing from the shores of Africa are hot and dry; and\r\nhygrometrical experiments recently made in Malta and other places, show\r\nthat the mean quantity of moisture in the air investing the\r\nMediterranean is equal only to one half of that in the atmosphere of\r\nEngland. The temperature also of the great inland sea is upon an average\r\nhigher, by 3-1/2 degrees of Fahrenheit, than the eastern part of the\r\nAtlantic Ocean in the same latitude, which must greatly promote its\r\nevaporation. The Black Sea being situated in a higher latitude, and\r\nbeing the receptacle of rivers flowing from the north, is much colder,\r\nand its expenditure far less; accordingly it does not draw any supply\r\nfrom the Mediterranean, but, on the contrary, contributes to it by a\r\ncurrent flowing outwards, for the most part of the year, through the\r\nDardanelles. The discharge, however, at the Bosphorus is so small, when\r\ncompared to the volume of water carried in by rivers, as to imply a\r\ngreat amount of evaporation in the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n_Whether salt be precipitated in the Mediterranean._--It is, however,\r\nobjected, that evaporation carries away only fresh water, and that the\r\ncurrent from the Atlantic is continually bringing in salt water: why,\r\nthen, do not the component parts of the waters of the Mediterranean\r\nvary? or how can they remain so nearly the same as those of the ocean?\r\nSome have imagined that the excess of salt might be carried away by an\r\nunder-current running in a contrary direction to the superior; and this\r\nhypothesis appeared to receive confirmation from a late discovery, that\r\nthe water taken up about fifty miles within the Straits, from a depth of\r\n670 fathoms, contained a quantity of salt _four times greater_ than the\r\nwater of the surface. Dr. Wollaston,[457] who analyzed this water\r\nobtained by Captain Smyth, truly inferred that an under-current of such\r\ndenser water flowing outward, if of equal breadth and depth with the\r\ncurrent near the surface, would carry out as much salt below as is\r\nbrought in above, although it moved with less than one-fourth part of\r\nthe velocity, and would thus prevent a perpetual increase of saltness in\r\nthe Mediterranean beyond that existing in the Atlantic. It was also\r\nremarked by others, that the result would be the same, if the swiftness\r\nbeing equal, the inferior current had only one-fourth of the volume of\r\nthe superior. At the same time there appeared reason to conclude that\r\nthis great specific gravity was only acquired by water at immense\r\ndepths; for two specimens of the water, taken within the Mediterranean,\r\nat the distance of some hundred miles from the Straits, and at depths of\r\n400 and even 450 fathoms, were found by Dr. Wollaston not to exceed in\r\ndensity that of many ordinary samples of sea-water. Such being the case,\r\nwe can now prove that the vast amount of salt brought into the\r\nMediterranean _does not_ pass out again by the Straits; for it appears\r\nby Captain Smyth's soundings, which Dr. Wallaston had not seen, that\r\nbetween the capes of Trafalgar and Spartel, which are twenty-two miles\r\napart, and where the Straits are shallowest, the deepest part, which is\r\non the side of Cape Spartel, is only 220 fathoms. It is therefore\r\nevident, that if water sinks in certain parts of the Mediterranean, in\r\nconsequence of the increase of its specific gravity, to greater depths\r\nthan 220 fathoms, it can never flow out again into the Atlantic, since\r\nit must be stopped by the submarine barrier which crosses the shallowest\r\npart of the Straits of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the existence of a counter-current, at a certain depth,\r\nfirst originated in the following circumstances:--M. De l'Aigle,\r\ncommander of a privateer called the Phoenix of Marseilles, gave chase\r\nto a Dutch merchant-ship, near Ceuta Point, and coming up with her in\r\nthe middle of the gut, between Tariffa and Tangier, gave her one\r\nbroadside, which directly sunk her. A few days after, the sunken ship,\r\nwith her cargo of brandy and oil, was cast ashore near Tangier, which is\r\nat least four leagues to the westward of the place where she went down,\r\nand to which she must have floated in a direction contrary to the course\r\nof the _central_ current.[458] This fact, however, affords no evidence\r\nof an under-current, because the ship, when it approached the coast,\r\nwould necessarily be within the influence of a lateral current, which\r\nrunning westward twice every twenty-four hours, might have brought back\r\nthe vessel to Tangier.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, becomes of the excess of salt?--for this is an inquiry of\r\nthe highest geological interest. The Rhone, the Po, the Nile, and many\r\nhundred minor streams and springs, pour annually into the Mediterranean\r\nlarge quantities of carbonate of lime, together with iron, magnesia,\r\nsilica, alumina, sulphur, and other mineral ingredients in a state of\r\nchemical solution. To explain why the influx of this matter does not\r\nalter the composition of this sea has never been regarded as a\r\ndifficulty; for it is known that calcareous rocks are forming in the\r\ndelta of the Rhone, in the Adriatic, on the coast of Asia Minor, and in\r\nother localities. Precipitation is acknowledged to be the means whereby\r\nthe surplus mineral matter is disposed of, after the consumption of a\r\ncertain portion in the secretions of testacea, zoophytes, and other\r\nmarine animals. But before muriate of soda can, in like manner, be\r\nprecipitated, the whole Mediterranean ought, according to the received\r\nprinciples of chemistry, to become as much saturated with salt as Lake\r\nAral, the Dead Sea, or the brine-springs of Cheshire.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly true, in regard to small bodies of water, that every\r\nparticle must be fully saturated with muriate of soda before a single\r\ncrystal of salt can be formed; such is probably the case in all natural\r\nsalterns: such, for example, as those described by travellers as\r\noccurring on the western borders of the Black Sea, where extensive\r\nmarshes are said to be covered by thin films of salt after a rapid\r\nevaporation of sea-water. The salt _atangs_ of the Rhone, where salt has\r\nsometimes been precipitated in considerable abundance, have been already\r\nmentioned. In regard to the depth of the Mediterranean, it appears that\r\nbetween Gibraltar and Ceuta, Captain Smyth sounded to the enormous depth\r\nof 950 fathoms, and found there a gravelly bottom, with fragments of\r\nbroken shells. Saussure sounded to the depth of two thousand feet,\r\nwithin a few yards of the shore, at Nice; and M. Barard has lately\r\nfathomed to the depth of more than six thousand feet in several places\r\nwithout reaching the bottom.[459]\r\n\r\nThe central abysses, therefore, of this sea are, in all likelihood, at\r\nleast as deep as the Alps are high; and, as at the depth of seven\r\nhundred fathoms only, water has been found to contain a proportion of\r\nsalt four times greater than at the surface, we may presume that the\r\nexcess of salt may be much greater at the depth of two or three miles.\r\nAfter evaporation, the surface water becomes impregnated with a slight\r\nexcess of salt, and its specific gravity being thus increased, it\r\ninstantly falls to the bottom, while lighter water rises to the top, or\r\nflows in laterally, being always supplied by rivers and the current from\r\nthe Atlantic. The heavier fluid, when it arrives at the bottom, cannot\r\nstop if it can gain access to any lower part of the bed of the sea, not\r\npreviously occupied by water of the same density.\r\n\r\nHow far this accumulation of brine can extend before the inferior strata\r\nof water will part with any of their salt, and what difference in such a\r\nchemical process the immense pressure of the incumbent ocean, or the\r\nescape of heated vapors, thermal springs, or submarine volcanic\r\neruptions, might occasion, are questions which cannot be answered in the\r\npresent state of science.\r\n\r\nThe Straits of Gibraltar are said to become gradually wider by the\r\nwearing down of the cliffs on each side at many points; and the current\r\nsets along the coast of Africa, so as to cause considerable inroads in\r\nvarious parts, particularly near Carthage. Near the Canopic mouth of the\r\nNile, at Aboukir, the coast was greatly devastated in the year 1784,\r\nwhen a small island was nearly consumed. By a series of similar\r\noperations, the old site of the cities of Nicropolis, Taposiris, Parva\r\nand Canopus, have become a sand-bank.[460]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nREPRODUCTIVE EFFECTS OF TIDES AND CURRENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Estuaries, how formed--Silting up of estuaries does not compensate\r\n    the loss of land on the borders of the ocean--Bed of the German\r\n    Ocean--Composition and extent of its sand-banks--Strata deposited by\r\n    currents in the English channel--On the shores of the\r\n    Mediterranean--At the mouths of the Amazon, Orinoco, and\r\n    Mississippi--Wide area over which strata may be formed by this\r\n    cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the facts enumerated in the last chapter, it appears that on the\r\nborders of the ocean, currents and tides co-operating with the waves of\r\nthe sea are most powerful instruments in the destruction and\r\ntransportation of rocks; and as numerous tributaries discharge their\r\nalluvial burden into the channel of one great river, so we find that\r\nmany rivers deliver their earthy contents to one marine current, to be\r\nborne by it to a distance, and deposited in some deep receptacle of the\r\nocean. The current, besides receiving this tribute of sedimentary matter\r\nfrom streams draining the land, acts also itself on the coast, as does a\r\nriver on the cliffs which bound a valley. Yet the waste of cliffs by\r\nmarine currents constitutes on the whole a very insignificant portion of\r\nthe denudation annually effected by aqueous causes, as I shall point out\r\nin the sequel of this chapter (p. 339).\r\n\r\nIn inland seas, where the tides are insensible, or on those parts of the\r\nborders of the ocean where they are feeble, it is scarcely possible to\r\nprevent a harbor at a river's mouth from silting up; for a bar of sand\r\nor mud is formed at points where the velocity of the turbid river is\r\nchecked by the sea, or where the river and a marine current neutralize\r\neach other's force. For the current, as we have seen, may, like the\r\nriver, hold in suspension a large quantity of sediment, or, co-operating\r\nwith the waves, may cause the progressive motion of a shingle beach in\r\none direction. I have already alluded to the erection of piers and\r\ngroins at certain places on our southern coast, to arrest the course of\r\nthe shingle and sand (see p. 318). The immediate effect of these\r\ntemporary obstacles is to cause a great accumulation of pebbles on one\r\nside of the barrier, after which the beach still moves on round the end\r\nof the pier at a greater distance from the land. This system, however,\r\nis often attended with a serious evil, for during storms the waves throw\r\nsuddenly into the harbor the vast heap of pebbles which have collected\r\nfor years behind the groin or pier, as happened during a great gale\r\n(Jan. 1839) at Dover.\r\n\r\nThe formation and keeping open of large estuaries are due to the\r\n_combined influence_ of tidal currents and rivers; for when the tide\r\nrises, a large body of water suddenly enters the mouth of the river,\r\nwhere, becoming confined within narrower bounds, while its momentum is\r\nnot destroyed, it is urged on, and, having to pass through a contracted\r\nchannel, rises and runs with increased velocity, just as a stream when\r\nit reaches the arch of a bridge scarcely large enough to give passage to\r\nits waters, rushes with a steep fall through the arch. During the ascent\r\nof the tide, a body of fresh water, flowing down in an opposite\r\ndirection from the higher country, is arrested in its course for several\r\nhours; and thus a large lake of fresh and brackish water is accumulated,\r\nwhich, when the sea ebbs, is let loose, as on the removal of an\r\nartificial sluice or dam. By the force of this retiring water, the\r\nalluvial sediment both of the river and of the sea is swept away, and\r\ntransported to such a distance from the mouth of the estuary, that a\r\nsmall part only can return with the next tide.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens, that during a violent storm a large bar of sand is\r\nsuddenly made to shift its position, so as to prevent the free influx of\r\nthe tides, or efflux of river water. Thus about the year 1500 the sands\r\nat Bayonne were suddenly thrown across the mouth of the Adour. That\r\nriver, flowing back upon itself, soon forced a passage to the northward\r\nalong the sandy plain of Capbreton, till at last it reached the sea at\r\nBoucau, at the distance of _seven leagues_ from the point where it had\r\nformerly entered. It was not till the year 1579 that the celebrated\r\narchitect Louis de Foix undertook, at the desire of Henry III., to\r\nreopen the ancient channel, which he at last effected with great\r\ndifficulty.[461]\r\n\r\nIn the estuary of the Thames at London, and in the Gironde, the tide\r\nrises only for five hours and ebbs seven, and in all estuaries the water\r\nrequires a longer time to run down than up; so that the preponderating\r\nforce is always in the direction which tends to keep open a deep and\r\nbroad passage. But for reasons already explained, there is naturally a\r\ntendency in all estuaries to silt up partially, since eddies, and\r\nbackwaters, and points where opposing streams meet, are very numerous,\r\nand constantly change their position.\r\n\r\nMany writers have declared that the gain on our eastern coast, since the\r\nearliest periods of history, has more than counterbalanced the loss; but\r\nthey have been at no pains to calculate the amount of loss, and have\r\noften forgotten that, while the new acquisitions are manifest, there are\r\nrarely any natural monuments to attest the former existence of the land\r\nthat has been carried away. They have also taken into their account\r\nthose tracts artificially recovered, which are often of great\r\nagricultural importance, and may remain secure, perhaps, for thousands\r\nof years, but which are only a few feet above the mean level of the sea,\r\nand are therefore exposed to be overflowed again by a small proportion\r\nof the force required to move cliffs of considerable height on our\r\nshores. If it were true that the area of land annually abandoned by the\r\nsea in estuaries were equal to that invaded by it, there would still be\r\nno compensation _in kind_.\r\n\r\nThe tidal current which flows out from the northwest, and bears against\r\nthe eastern coast of England, transports, as we have seen, materials of\r\nvarious kinds. Aided by the waves, it undermines and sweeps away the\r\ngranite, gneiss, trap-rocks, and sandstone of Shetland, and removes the\r\ngravel and loam of the cliffs of Holderness, Norfolk, and Suffolk, which\r\nare between twenty and three hundred feet in height, and which waste at\r\nvarious rates of from one foot to six yards annually. It also bears\r\naway, in co-operation with the Thames and the tides, the strata of\r\nLondon clay on the coast of Essex and Sheppey. The sea at the same time\r\nconsumes the chalk with its flints for many miles continuously on the\r\nshores of Kent and Sussex--commits annual ravages on the freshwater\r\nbeds, capped by a thick covering of chalk-flint gravel, in Hampshire,\r\nand continually saps the foundations of the Portland limestone. It\r\nreceives, besides, during the rainy months, large supplies of pebbles,\r\nsand, and mud, which numerous streams from the Grampians, Cheviots, and\r\nother chains, send down to the sea. To what regions, then, is all this\r\nmatter consigned? It is not retained in mechanical suspension by the\r\nwaters of the ocean, nor does it mix with them in a state of chemical\r\nsolution--it is deposited _somewhere_, yet certainly not in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of our shores; for, in that case, there would\r\nsoon be a cessation of the encroachment of the sea, and large tracts of\r\nlow land, like Romney Marsh, would almost everywhere encircle our\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nAs there is now a depth of water exceeding thirty feet, in some spots\r\nwhere towns like Dunwich flourished but a few centuries ago, it is clear\r\nthat the current not only carries far away the materials of the wasted\r\ncliffs, but is capable also of excavating the bed of the sea to a\r\ncertain moderate depth.\r\n\r\nSo great is the quantity of matter held in suspension by the tidal\r\ncurrent on our shores, that the waters are in some places artificially\r\nintroduced into certain lands below the level of the sea; and by\r\nrepeating this operation, which is called \"warping,\" for two or three\r\nyears, considerable tracts have been raised, in the estuary of the\r\nHumber, to the height of about six feet. If a current, charged with such\r\nmaterials, meets with deep depressions in the bed of the ocean, it must\r\noften fill them up; just as a river, when it meets with a lake in its\r\ncourse, fills it gradually with sediment.\r\n\r\nI have said (p. 337) that the action of the waves and currents on\r\nsea-cliffs, or their power to remove matter from above to below the\r\nsea-level, is insignificant in comparison with the power of rivers to\r\nperform the same task. As an illustration we may take the coast of\r\nHolderness described in the last chapter (p. 304). It is composed, as we\r\nhave seen, of very destructible materials, is thirty-six miles long, and\r\nits average height may be taken at forty feet. As it has wasted away at\r\nthe rate of two and a quarter yards annually, for a long period, it will\r\nbe found on calculation that the quantity of matter thrown down into the\r\nsea every year, and removed by the current, amounts to 51,321,600 cubic\r\nfeet. It has been shown that the united Ganges and Brahmapootra carry\r\ndown to the Bay of Bengal 40,000,000,000 of cubic feet of solid matter\r\nevery year, so that their transporting power is no less than 780 times\r\ngreater than that of the sea on the coast above-mentioned; and in order\r\nto produce a result equal to that of the two Indian rivers, we must have\r\na line of wasting coast, like that of Holderness, nearly 28,000 miles in\r\nlength, or longer than the entire circumference of the globe by above\r\n3000 miles. The reason of so great a difference in the results may be\r\nunderstood when we reflect that the operations of the ocean are limited\r\nto a single line of cliff surrounding a large area, whereas great rivers\r\nwith their tributaries, and the mountain torrents which flow into them,\r\nact simultaneously on a length of bank almost indefinite.\r\n\r\nNevertheless we are by no means entitled to infer, that the denuding\r\nforce of the great ocean is a geological cause of small efficacy, or\r\ninferior to that of rivers. Its chief influence is exerted at moderate\r\ndepths below the surface, on all those areas which are slowly rising, or\r\nare attempting, as it were, to rise above the sea. From data hitherto\r\nobtained respecting subterranean movements, we can scarcely speculate on\r\nan average rate of upheaval of more than two or three feet in a century.\r\nAn elevation to this amount is taking place in Scandinavia, and probably\r\nin many submarine areas as vast as those which we know to be sinking\r\nfrom the proofs derived from circular lagoon islands or coral atolls.\r\n(See chap. 50.) Suppose strata as destructible as those of the Wealden,\r\nor the lower and upper cretaceous formation, or the tertiary deposits of\r\nthe British Isles to be thus slowly upheaved, how readily might they all\r\nbe swept away by waves and currents in an open sea! How entirely might\r\neach stratum disappear as it was brought up successively and exposed to\r\nthe breakers! Shoals of wide extent might be produced, but it is\r\ndifficult to conceive how any continent could ever be formed under such\r\ncircumstances. Were it not indeed for the hardness and toughness of the\r\ncrystalline and volcanic rocks, which are often capable of resisting the\r\naction of the waves, few lands might ever emerge from the midst of an\r\nopen sea.\r\n\r\n_Supposed filling up of the German Ocean._--The German Ocean is deepest\r\non the Norwegian side, where the soundings give 190 fathoms; but the\r\nmean depth of the whole basin may be stated at no more than thirty-one\r\nfathoms.[462] The bed of this sea is traversed by several enormous\r\nbanks, the greatest of which is the Dogger Bank, extending for upwards\r\nof 354 miles from north to south. The whole superficies of these shoals\r\nis equal to about one-third of the whole extent of England and Scotland.\r\nThe average height of the banks measures, according to Mr. Stevenson,\r\nabout seventy-eight feet; the upper portion of them consisting of fine\r\nand coarse siliceous sand, mixed with comminuted corals and shells.[463]\r\nIt had been supposed that these vast submarine hills were made up bodily\r\nof loose materials supplied from the waste of the English, Dutch, and\r\nother coasts; but the survey of the North Sea, conducted by Captain\r\nHewett, affords ground for suspecting this opinion to be erroneous. If\r\nsuch immense mounds of sand and mud had been accumulated under the\r\ninfluence of currents, the same causes ought nearly to have reduced to\r\none level the entire bottom of the German Ocean; instead of which some\r\nlong narrow ravines are found to intersect the banks. One of these\r\nvaries from seventeen to forty-four fathoms in depth, and has very\r\nprecipitous sides; in one part, called the \"Inner Silver Pits,\" it is\r\nfifty-five fathoms deep. The shallowest parts of the Dogger Bank were\r\nfound to be forty-two feet under water, except in one place, where the\r\nwreck of a ship had caused a shoal. Such uniformity in the minimum depth\r\nof water seems to imply that the currents, which vary in their velocity\r\nfrom a mile to two miles and a half per hour, have power to prevent the\r\naccumulation of drift matter in places of less depth.\r\n\r\n_Strata deposited by currents._--It appears extraordinary, that in some\r\ntracts of the sea, adjoining the coast of England, where we know that\r\ncurrents are not only sweeping along rocky masses, thrown down, from\r\ntime to time, from the high cliffs, but also occasionally scooping out\r\nchannels in the regular strata, there should exist fragile shells and\r\ntender zoophytes in abundance, which live uninjured by these violent\r\nmovements. The ocean, however, is in this respect a counterpart of the\r\nland; and as, on the continents, rivers may undermine their banks,\r\nuproot trees, and roll along sand and gravel, while their waters are\r\ninhabited by testacea and fish, and their alluvial plains are adorned\r\nwith rich vegetation and forests, so the sea may be traversed by rapid\r\ncurrents, and its bed may here and there suffer great local derangement,\r\nwithout any interruption of the general order and tranquillity. It has\r\nbeen ascertained by soundings in all parts of the world, that where new\r\ndeposits are taking place in the sea, coarse sand and small pebbles\r\ncommonly occur near the shore, while farther from land, and in deeper\r\nwater, finer sand and broken shells are spread out over the bottom.\r\nStill farther out, the finest mud and ooze are alone met with. Mr.\r\nAusten observes that this rule holds good in every part of the English\r\nChannel examined by him. He also informs us, that where the tidal\r\ncurrent runs rapidly in what are called \"races,\" where surface\r\nundulations are perceived in the calmest weather, over deep banks, the\r\ndiscoloration of the water does not arise from the power of such a\r\ncurrent to disturb the bottom at a depth of 40 or 80 fathoms, as some\r\nhave supposed. In these cases, a column of water sometimes 500 feet in\r\nheight, is moving onwards with the tide clear and transparent above,\r\nwhile the lower portion holds fine sediment in suspension (a fact\r\nascertained by soundings), when suddenly it impinges upon a bank, and\r\nits height is reduced to 300 feet. It is thus made to boil up and flow\r\noff at the surface, a process which forces up the lower strata of water\r\ncharged with fine particles of mud, which in their passage from the\r\ncoast had gradually sunk to a depth of 300 feet or more.[464]\r\n\r\nOne important character in the formations produced by currents is, the\r\nimmense extent over which they may be the means of diffusing homogeneous\r\nmixtures, for these are often coextensive with a great line of coast;\r\nand, by comparison with their deposits, the deltas of rivers must shrink\r\ninto significance. In the Mediterranean, the same current which is\r\nrapidly destroying many parts of the African coast, between the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar and the Nile, checks also the growth of the delta of the\r\nNile, and drifts the sediment of that great river to the eastward. To\r\nthis source may be attributed the rapid accretions of land on parts of\r\nthe Syrian shores where rivers do not enter.\r\n\r\nAmong the greatest deposits now in progress, and of which the\r\ndistribution is chiefly determined by currents, we may class those\r\nbetween the mouths of the Amazon and the southern coast of North\r\nAmerica. Captain Sabine found that the equatorial current before\r\nmentioned (p. 292) was running with the rapidity of four miles an hour\r\nwhere it crosses the stream of the Amazon, which river preserves part of\r\nits original impulse, and has its waters not wholly mingled with those\r\nof the ocean at the distance of 300 miles from its mouth.[465] The\r\nsediment of the Amazon is thus constantly carried to the northwest as\r\nfar as to the mouths of the Orinoco, and an immense tract of swamp is\r\nformed along the coast of Guiana, with a long range of muddy shoals\r\nbordering the marshes, and becoming converted into land.[466] The\r\nsediment of the Orinoco is partly detained, and settles near its mouth,\r\ncausing the shores of Trinidad to extend rapidly, and is partly swept\r\naway into the Carribean Sea by the Guinea current. According to\r\nHumboldt, much sediment is carried again out of the Carribean Sea into\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nIt should not be overlooked that marine currents, even on coasts where\r\nthere are no large rivers, may still be the agents of spreading not only\r\nsand and pebbles, but the finest mud, far and wide over the bottom of\r\nthe ocean. _For several thousand miles_ along the western coast of South\r\nAmerica, comprising the larger parts of Peru and Chili, there is a\r\nperpetual rolling of shingle along the shore, part of which, as Mr.\r\nDarwin has shown, are incessantly reduced to the finest mud by the\r\nwaves, and swept into the depths of the Pacific by the tides and\r\ncurrents. The same author however has remarked that, notwithstanding the\r\ngreat force of the waves on that shore, all rocks 60 feet under water\r\nare covered by sea-weed, showing that the bed of the sea is not denuded\r\nat that depth, the effects of the winds being comparatively superficial.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the distribution of sediment by currents it may be\r\nobserved, that the rate of subsidence of the finer mud carried down by\r\nevery great river into the ocean, or of that caused by the rolling of\r\nthe waves upon a shore, must be extremely slow; for the more minute the\r\nseparate particles of mud, the slower will they sink to the bottom, and\r\nthe sooner will they acquire what is called their terminal velocity. It\r\nis well known that a solid body, descending through a resisting medium,\r\nfalls by the force of gravity, which is constant, but its motion is\r\nresisted by the medium more and more as its velocity increases, until\r\nthe resistance becomes sufficient to counteract the farther increase of\r\nvelocity. For example, a leaden ball, one inch diameter, falling through\r\nair of density as at the earth's surface, will never acquire greater\r\nvelocity than 260 feet per second, and, in water, its greatest velocity\r\nwill be 8 feet 6 inches per second. If the diameter of the ball were\r\n1/100 of an inch, the terminal velocities in air would be 26 feet, and\r\nin water .86 of a foot per second.\r\n\r\nNow, every chemist is familiar with the fact, that minute particles\r\ndescend with extreme slowness through water, the extent of their surface\r\nbeing very great in proportion to their weight, and the resistance of\r\nthe fluid depending on the amount of surface. A precipitate of sulphate\r\nof baryta, for example, will sometimes require more than five or six\r\nhours to subside one inch;[467] while oxalate and phosphate of lime\r\nrequire nearly an hour to subside about an inch and a half and two\r\ninches respectively,[468] so exceedingly small are the particles of\r\nwhich these substances consist.\r\n\r\nWhen we recollect that the depth of the ocean is supposed frequently to\r\nexceed three miles, and that currents run through different parts of\r\nthat ocean at the rate of four miles an hour, and when at the same time\r\nwe consider that some fine mud carried away from the mouths of rivers\r\nand from sea-beaches, where there is a heavy surf, as well as the\r\nimpalpable powder showered down by volcanoes, may subside at the rate of\r\nonly an inch per hour, we shall be prepared to find examples of the\r\ntransportation of sediment over areas of indefinite extent.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for the emery powder used in polishing glass to take\r\nmore than an hour to sink one foot. Suppose mud composed of coarser\r\nparticles to fall at the rate of two feet per hour, and these to be\r\ndischarged into that part of the Gulf Stream which preserves a mean\r\nvelocity of three miles an hour for a distance of two thousand miles; in\r\ntwenty-eight days these particles will be carried 2016 miles, and will\r\nhave fallen only to a depth of 224 fathoms.\r\n\r\nIn this example, however, it is assumed that the current retains its\r\nsuperficial velocity at the depth of 224 fathoms, for which we have as\r\nyet no data, although we have seen that the motion of a current may\r\ncontinue at the depth of 100 fathoms. (See above, p. 28.) Experiments\r\nshould be made to ascertain the rate of currents at considerable\r\ndistances from the surface, and the time taken by the finest sediment to\r\nsettle in sea-water of a given depth, and then the geologist may\r\ndetermine the area over which homogeneous mixtures may be simultaneously\r\ndistributed in certain seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nIGNEOUS CAUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Changes of the inorganic world, _continued_--Igneous\r\n    causes--Division of the subject--Distinct volcanic regions--Region\r\n    of the Andes--System of volcanoes extending from the Aleutian isles\r\n    to the Molucca and Sunda islands--Polynesian archipelago--Volcanic\r\n    region extending from Central Asia to the Azores--Tradition of\r\n    deluges on the shores of the Bosphorus, Hellespont, and Grecian\r\n    isles--Periodical alternation of earthquakes in Syria and Southern\r\n    Italy--Western limits of the European region--Earthquakes rarer and\r\n    more feeble as we recede from the centres of volcanic action.\r\n    Extinct volcanoes not to be included in lines of active vents.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto considered the changes wrought, since the times of\r\nhistory and tradition, by the continued action of aqueous causes on the\r\nearth's surface; and we have next to examine those resulting from\r\nigneous agency. As the rivers and springs on the land, and the tides and\r\ncurrents in the sea, have, with some slight modifications, been fixed\r\nand constant to certain localities from the earliest periods of which we\r\nhave any records, so the volcano and the earthquake have, with few\r\nexceptions, continued, during the same lapse of time, to disturb the\r\nsame regions. But as there are signs, on almost every part of our\r\ncontinent, of great power having been exerted by running water on the\r\nsurface of the land, and by waves, tides, and currents on cliffs\r\nbordering the sea, where, in modern times, no rivers have excavated, and\r\nno waves or tidal currents undermined--so we find signs of volcanic\r\nvents and violent subterranean movements in places where the action of\r\nfire or internal heat has long been dormant. We can explain why the\r\nintensity of the force of aqueous causes should be developed in\r\nsuccession in different districts. Currents, for example, tides, and the\r\nwaves of the sea, cannot destroy coasts, shape out or silt up estuaries,\r\nbreak through isthmuses, and annihilate islands, form shoals in one\r\nplace, and remove them from another, without the direction and position\r\nof their destroying and transporting power becoming transferred to new\r\nlocalities. Neither can the relative levels of the earth's crust, above\r\nand beneath the waters, vary from time to time, as they are admitted to\r\nhave varied at former periods, and as it will be demonstrated that they\r\nstill do, without the continents being, in the course of ages, modified,\r\nand even entirely altered, in their external configuration. Such events\r\nmust clearly be accompanied by a complete change in the volume,\r\nvelocity, and direction of the streams and land floods to which certain\r\nregions give passage. That we should find, therefore, cliffs where the\r\nsea once committed ravages, and from which it has now retired--estuaries\r\nwhere high tides once rose, but which are now dried up--valleys hollowed\r\nout by water, where no streams now flow, is no more than we should\r\nexpect; these and similar phenomena are the necessary consequences of\r\nphysical causes now in operation; and if there be no instability in the\r\nlaws of nature, similar fluctuations must recur again and again in time\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nBut, however natural it may be that the force of running water in\r\nnumerous valleys, and of tides and currents in many tracts of the sea,\r\nshould now be _spent_, it is by no means so easy to explain why the\r\nviolence of the earthquake and the fire of the volcano should also have\r\nbecome locally extinct at successive periods. We can look back to the\r\ntime when the marine strata, whereon the great mass of Etna rests, had\r\nno existence; and that time is extremely modern in the earth's history.\r\nThis alone affords ground for anticipating that the eruptions of Etna\r\nwill one day cease.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Nec quae sulfureis ardet fornacibus, AEtna\r\n  Ignea semper erit, _neque enim fuit ignea semper_,\r\n\r\n  (Ovid, _Metam._ lib. 15-340,)\r\n\r\n\r\nare the memorable words which are put into the mouth of Pythagoras by\r\nthe Roman poet, and they are followed by speculations as to the cause of\r\nvolcanic vents shifting their positions. Whatever doubts the philosopher\r\nexpresses as to the nature of these causes, it is assumed, as\r\nincontrovertible, that the points of eruption will hereafter vary,\r\n_because they have formerly done so_; a principle of reasoning which, as\r\nI have endeavored to show in former chapters, has been too much set at\r\nnaught by some of the earlier schools of geology, which refused to\r\nconclude that great revolutions in the earth's surface are now in\r\nprogress, or that they will take place hereafter, _because_ they have\r\noften been repeated in former ages.\r\n\r\n_Division of the subject._--Volcanic action may be defined to be \"the\r\ninfluence exerted by the heated interior of the earth on its external\r\ncovering.\" If we adopt this definition, without connecting it, as\r\nHumboldt has done, with the theory of secular refrigeration, or the\r\ncooling down of an original heated and fluid nucleus, we may then class\r\nunder a general head all the subterranean phenomena, whether of\r\nvolcanoes, or earthquakes, and those insensible movements of the land,\r\nby which, as will afterwards appear, large districts may be depressed or\r\nelevated, without convulsions. According to this view, I shall consider\r\nfirst, the volcano; secondly, the earthquake; thirdly, the rising or\r\nsinking of land in countries where there are no volcanoes or\r\nearthquakes; fourthly, the probable _causes_ of the changes which result\r\nfrom subterranean agency.\r\n\r\nIt is a very general opinion that earthquakes and volcanoes have a\r\ncommon origin; for both are confined to certain regions, although the\r\nsubterranean movements are least violent in the immediate proximity of\r\nvolcanic vents, especially where the discharge of aeriform fluids and\r\nmelted rock is made constantly from the same crater. But as there are\r\nparticular regions, to which both the points of eruption and the\r\nmovements of great earthquakes are confined, I shall begin by tracing\r\nout the geographical boundaries of some of these, that the reader may\r\nbe aware of the magnificent scale on which the agency of subterranean\r\nfire is now simultaneously developed. Over the whole of the vast tracts\r\nalluded to, active volcanic vents are distributed at intervals, and most\r\ncommonly arranged in a linear direction. Throughout the intermediate\r\nspaces there is often abundant evidence that the subterranean fire is at\r\nwork continuously, for the ground is convulsed from time to time by\r\nearthquakes; gaseous vapors, especially carbonic acid gas, are\r\ndisengaged plentifully from the soil; springs often issue at a very high\r\ntemperature, and their waters are usually impregnated with the same\r\nmineral matters as are discharged by volcanoes during eruptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC REGIONS.\r\n\r\n_Region of the Andes._--Of these great regions, that of the Andes of\r\nSouth America is one of the best defined, extending from the southward\r\nof Chili to the northward of Quito, from about lat. 43 degrees S. to\r\nabout 2 degrees N. of the equator. In this range, however, comprehending\r\nforty-five degrees of latitude, there is an alternation on a grand scale\r\nof districts of active with those of extinct volcanoes, or which, if not\r\nspent, have at least been dormant for the last three centuries. How long\r\nan interval of rest may entitle us to consider a volcano as entirely\r\nextinct is not easily determined; but we know that in Ischia there\r\nintervened between two consecutive eruptions a pause of seventeen\r\ncenturies; and the discovery of America is an event of far too recent a\r\ndate to allow us even to conjecture whether different portions of the\r\nAndes, nearly the whole of which are subject to earthquakes, may not\r\nexperience alternately a cessation and renewal of eruptions.\r\n\r\nThe first line of active vents which have been seen in eruption in the\r\nAndes extends from lat. 43 degrees 28 minutes S.; or, from Yantales,\r\nopposite the isle of Chiloe, to Coquimbo, in lat. 30 degrees S.; to\r\nthese thirteen degrees of latitude succeed more than eight degrees in\r\nwhich no recent volcanic eruptions have been observed. We then come to\r\nthe volcanoes of Bolivia and Peru, reaching six degrees from S. to N.,\r\nor from lat. 21 degrees S. to lat. 15 degrees S. Between the Peruvian\r\nvolcanoes and those of Quito, another space intervenes of no less than\r\nfourteen degrees of latitude, said to be free from volcanic action so\r\nfar as yet known. The volcanoes of Quito then succeed, beginning about\r\n100 geographical miles south of the equator, and continuing for about\r\n130 miles north of the line, when there occurs another undisturbed\r\ninterval of more than six degrees of latitude, after which we arrive at\r\nthe volcanoes of Guatemala or Central America, north of the Isthmus of\r\nPanama.[469]\r\n\r\nHaving thus traced out the line from south to north, I may first state,\r\nin regard to the numerous vents of Chili, that the volcanoes of Yantales\r\nand Osorno were in eruption during the great earthquake of 1835, at the\r\nsame moment that the land was shaken in Chiloe, and in some parts of the\r\nChilian coast permanently upheaved; whilst at Juan Fernandez, at the\r\ndistance of no less than 720 geographical miles from Yantales, an\r\neruption took place beneath the sea. Some of the volcanoes of Chili are\r\nof great height, as that of Antuco, in lat. 37 degrees 40 minutes S.,\r\nthe summit of which is at least 16,000 feet above the sea. From the\r\nflanks of this volcano, at a great height, immense currents of lava have\r\nissued, one of which flowed in the year 1828. This event is said to be\r\nan exception in the general rule; few volcanoes in the Andes, and none\r\nof those in Quito, having been seen in modern times to pour out lava,\r\nbut having merely ejected vapor or scoriae.\r\n\r\nBoth the basaltic (or augitic) lavas, and those of the felspathic class,\r\noccur in Chili and other parts of the Andes; but the volcanic rocks of\r\nthe felspathic family are said by Von Buch to be generally not trachyte,\r\nbut a rock which has been called andesite, or a mixture of augite and\r\nalbite. The last-mentioned mineral contains soda instead of the potash\r\nfound in common felspar.\r\n\r\nThe volcano of Rancagua, lat. 34 degrees 15 minutes S., is said to be\r\nalways throwing out ashes and vapors like Stromboli, a proof of the\r\npermanently heated state of certain parts of the interior of the earth\r\nbelow. A year rarely passes in Chili without some slight shocks of\r\nearthquakes, and in certain districts not a month. Those shocks which\r\ncome from the side of the ocean are the most violent, and the same is\r\nsaid to be the case in Peru. The town of Copiapo was laid waste by this\r\nterrible scourge in the years 1773, 1796, and 1819, or in both cases\r\nafter regular intervals of twenty-three years. There have, however, been\r\nother shocks in that country in the periods intervening between the\r\ndates above mentioned, although probably all less severe, at least on\r\nthe exact site of Copiapo. The evidence against a regular recurrence of\r\nvolcanic convulsions at stated periods is so strong as a general fact,\r\nthat we must be on our guard against attaching too much importance to a\r\nfew striking but probably accidental coincidences. Among these last\r\nmight be adduced the case of Lima, violently shaken by an earthquake on\r\nthe 17th of June, 1578, and again on the very same day, 1678; or the\r\neruptions of Coseguina in the year 1709 and 1809, which are the only two\r\nrecorded of that volcano previous to that of 1835.[470]\r\n\r\nOf the permanent upheaval of land after earthquakes in Chili, I shall\r\nhave occasion to speak in the next chapter, when it will also be seen\r\nthat great shocks often coincide with eruptions, either submarine or\r\nfrom the cones of the Andes, showing the identity of the force which\r\nelevates continents with that which causes volcanic outbursts.[471]\r\n\r\nThe space between Chili and Peru, in which no volcanic action has been\r\nobserved, is 160 nautical leagues from south to north. It is, however,\r\nas Von Buch observes, that part of the Andes which is least known,\r\nbeing thinly peopled, and in some parts entirely desert. The volcanoes\r\nof Peru rise from a lofty platform to vast heights above the level of\r\nthe sea, from 17,000 to 20,000 feet. The lava which has issued from\r\nViejo, lat. 16 degrees 55 minutes S., accompanied by pumice, is composed\r\nof a mixture of crystals of albitic felspar, hornblende, and mica, a\r\nrock which has been considered as one of the varieties of andesite. Some\r\ntremendous earthquakes which have visited Peru in modern times will be\r\nmentioned in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\nThe volcanoes of Quito, occurring between the second degree of south and\r\nthe third degree of north latitude, rise to vast elevations above the\r\nsea, many of them being between 14,000 and 18,000 feet high. The Indians\r\nof Lican have a tradition that the mountain called L'Altar, or Capac\r\nUrcu, which means \"the chief,\" was once the highest of those near the\r\nequator, being higher than Chimborazo; but in the reign of Ouainia\r\nAbomatha, before the discovery of America, a prodigious eruption took\r\nplace, which lasted eight years, and broke it down. The fragments of\r\ntrachyte, says M. Boussingault, which once formed the conical summit of\r\nthis celebrated mountain, are at this day spread over the plain.[472]\r\nCotopaxi is the most lofty of all the South American volcanoes which\r\nhave been in a state of activity in modern times, its height being\r\n18,858 feet; and its eruptions have been more frequent and destructive\r\nthan those of any other mountain. It is a perfect cone, usually covered\r\nwith an enormous bed of snow, which has, however, been sometimes melted\r\nsuddenly during an eruption; as in January, 1803, for example, when the\r\nsnows were dissolved in one night.\r\n\r\nDeluges are often caused in the Andes by the liquefaction of great\r\nmasses of snow, and sometimes by the rending open, during earthquakes,\r\nof subterranean cavities filled with water. In these inundations fine\r\nvolcanic sand, loose stones, and other materials which the water meets\r\nwith in its descent, are swept away, and a vast quantity of mud, called\r\n\"moya,\" is thus formed and carried down into the lower regions. Mud\r\nderived from this source descended, in 1797, from the sides of\r\nTunguragua in Quito, and filled valleys a thousand feet wide to the\r\ndepth of six hundred feet, damming up rivers and causing lakes. In these\r\ncurrents and lakes of moya, thousands of small fish are sometimes\r\nenveloped, which, according to Humboldt, have lived and multiplied in\r\nsubterranean cavities. So great a quantity of these fish were ejected\r\nfrom the volcano of Imbaburu in 1691, that fevers, which prevailed at\r\nthe period, were attributed to the effluvia arising from the putrid\r\nanimal matter.\r\n\r\nIn Quito, many important revolutions in the physical features of the\r\ncountry are said to have resulted, within the memory of man, from the\r\nearthquakes by which it has been convulsed. M. Boussingault declares his\r\nbelief, that if a full register had been kept of all the convulsions\r\nexperienced here and in other populous districts of the Andes, it would\r\nbe found that the trembling of the earth had been incessant. The\r\nfrequency of the movement, he thinks, is not due to volcanic explosions,\r\nbut to the continual falling in of masses of rock which have been\r\nfractured and upheaved in a solid form at a comparatively recent epoch;\r\nbut a longer series of observations would be requisite to confirm this\r\nopinion. According to the same author, the height of several mountains\r\nof the Andes has diminished in modern times.[473]\r\n\r\nThe great crest or cordillera of the Andes is depressed at the Isthmus\r\nof Panama to a height of about 1000 feet, and at the lowest point of\r\nseparation between the two seas near the Gulf of San Miguel, to 150\r\nfeet. What some geographers regard as a continuation of that chain in\r\nCentral America lies to the east of a series of volcanoes, many of which\r\nare active in the provinces of Pasto, Popayan, and Guatemala. Coseguina,\r\non the south side of the Gulf of Fonseca, was in eruption in January,\r\n1835, and some of its ashes fell at Truxillo, on the shores of the Gulf\r\nof Mexico. What is still more remarkable, on the same day, at Kingston,\r\nin Jamaica, the same shower of ashes fell, having been carried by an\r\nupper counter-current against the regular east wind which was then\r\nblowing. Kingston is about 700 miles distant from Coseguina, and these\r\nashes must have been more than four days in the air, having travelled\r\n170 miles a day. Eight leagues to the southward of the crater, the ashes\r\ncovered the ground to the depth of three yards and a half, destroying\r\nthe woods and dwellings. Thousands of cattle perished, their bodies\r\nbeing in many instances one mass of scorched flesh. Deer and other wild\r\nanimals sought the towns for protection; many birds and quadrupeds were\r\nfound suffocated in the ashes, and the neighboring streams were strewed\r\nwith dead fish.[474] Such facts throw light on geological monuments, for\r\nin the ashes thrown out at remote periods from the volcanoes of\r\nAuvergne, now extinct, we find the bones and skeletons of lost species\r\nof quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n_Mexico._--The great volcanic chain, after having thus pursued its\r\ncourse for several thousand miles from south to north, sends off a\r\nbranch in a new direction in Mexico, in the parallel of the city of that\r\nname, and is prolonged in a great platform between the eighteenth and\r\ntwenty-second degrees of north latitude. Five active volcanoes traverse\r\nMexico from west to east--Tu[\\x]tla, Orizaba, Popocatepetl, Jorullo, and\r\nColima. Jorullo, which is in the centre of the great platform, is no\r\nless than 120 miles from the nearest ocean--an important circumstance,\r\nas showing that the proximity of the sea is not a necessary condition,\r\nalthough certainly a very general characteristic of the position of\r\nactive volcanoes. The extraordinary eruption of this mountain, in 1759,\r\nwill be described in the sequel. If the line which connects these five\r\nvents be prolonged in a westerly direction, it cuts the volcanic group\r\nof islands called the Isles of Revillagigedo.\r\n\r\nTo the north of Mexico there are said to be three, or according to\r\nsome, five volcanoes in the peninsula of California; and a volcano is\r\nreported to have been in eruption in the N. W. coast of America, near\r\nthe Colombia river, lat. 45 degrees 37 minutes N.\r\n\r\n_West Indies._--To return to the Andes of Quito: Von Buch inclines to\r\nthe belief that if we were better acquainted with the region to the east\r\nof the Madalena, and with New Granada and the Caraccas, we might find\r\nthe volcanic chain of the Andes to be connected with that of the West\r\nIndian or Carribee Islands. The truth of this conjecture has almost been\r\nset at rest by the eruption, in 1848, of the volcano of Zamba, in New\r\nGrenada, at the mouth of the river Madalena.[475]\r\n\r\nOf the West Indian islands there are two parallel series: the one to the\r\nwest, which are all volcanic, and which rise to the height of several\r\nthousand feet; the others to the east, for the most part composed of\r\ncalcareous rocks, and very low. In the former or volcanic series, are\r\nGranada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Martinique, Dominica, Guadaloupe,\r\nMontserrat, Nevis, and St. Eustace. In the calcareous chain are Tobago,\r\nBarbadoes, Mariegallante, Grandeterre, Desirade, Antigua, Barbuda, St.\r\nBartholomew, and St. Martin. The most considerable eruptions in modern\r\ntimes have been those of St. Vincent. Great earthquakes have agitated\r\nSt. Domingo, as will be seen in the twenty-ninth chapter.\r\n\r\nI have before mentioned (p. 270) the violent earthquake which in 1812\r\nconvulsed the valley of the Mississippi at New Madrid, for the space of\r\n300 miles in length, of which more will be said in the twenty-seventh\r\nchapter. This happened exactly at the same time as the great earthquake\r\nof Caraccas, so that it is possible that these two points are parts of\r\none subterranean volcanic region. The island of Jamaica, with a tract of\r\nthe contiguous sea, has often experienced tremendous shocks; and these\r\nare frequent along a line extending from Jamaica to St. Domingo and\r\nPorto Rico.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that, without taking account of the West Indian and\r\nMexican branches, a linear train of volcanoes and tracts shaken by\r\nearthquakes may be traced from the island of Chiloe and opposite coast\r\nto Mexico, or even perhaps to the mouth of the Colombia river--a\r\ndistance upon the whole as great as from the pole to the equator. In\r\nregard to the western limits of the region, they lie deep beneath the\r\nwaves of the Pacific, and must continue unknown to us. On the east they\r\nare not prolonged, except where they include the West Indian Islands, to\r\na great distance; for there seem to be no indications of volcanic\r\ndisturbances in Buenos Ayres, Brazil, and the United States of North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.\r\n\r\nMAP OF ACTIVE VOLCANOES AND ATOLLS of THE INDIAN ARCHIPELAGO, and Part\r\nof the adjoining PACIFIC OCEAN.]\r\n\r\n_Volcanic region from the Aleutian Isles to the Moluccas and Isles of\r\nSunda._--On a scale which equals or surpasses that of the Andes, is\r\nanother line of volcanic action, which commences, on the north, with the\r\nAleutian Isles in Russian America, and extends, first in a westerly\r\ndirection for nearly 200 geographical miles, and then southwards, with\r\nfew interruptions, throughout a space of between sixty and seventy\r\ndegrees of latitude to the Moluccas, where it sends off a branch to the\r\nsoutheast while the principal train continues westerly through Sumbawa\r\nand Java to Sumatra, and then in a northwesterly direction to the Bay of\r\nBengal.[476] This volcanic line, observes Von Buch, may be said to\r\nfollow throughout its course the external border of the continent of\r\nAsia; while the branch which has been alluded to as striking southeast\r\nfrom the Moluccas, passes from New Guinea to New Zealand, conforming,\r\nthough somewhat rudely, to the outline of Australia.[477]\r\n\r\nThe connection, however, of the New Guinea volcanoes with the line in\r\nJava (as laid down in Von Buch's map) is not clearly made out. By\r\nconsulting Darwin's map of coral reefs and active volcanoes,[478] the\r\nreader will see that we might almost with equal propriety include the\r\nMariana and Bonin volcanoes in a band with New Guinea. Or if we allow so\r\nmuch latitude in framing zones of volcanic action, we must also suppose\r\nthe New Hebrides, Solomon Isles, and New Ireland to constitute one line\r\n(see map, fig. 39, p. 351).\r\n\r\nThe northern extremity of the volcanic region of Asia, as described by\r\nVon Buch, is on the borders of Cook's Inlet, northeast of the Peninsula\r\nof Alaska, where one volcano, in about the sixtieth degree of latitude,\r\nis said to be 14,000 feet high. In Alaska itself are cones of vast\r\nheight, which have been seen in eruption, and which are covered for\r\ntwo-thirds of their height downwards with perpetual snow. The summit of\r\nthe loftiest peak is truncated, and is said to have fallen in during an\r\neruption in 1786. From Alaska the line is continued through the Aleutian\r\nor Fox Islands to Kamtschatka. In the Aleutian Archipelago eruptions are\r\nfrequent, and about thirty miles to the north of Unalaska, near the Isle\r\nof Umnack, a new island was formed in 1796. It was first observed after\r\na storm, at a point in the sea from which a column of smoke had been\r\nseen to rise. Flames then issued from the new islet which illuminated\r\nthe country for ten miles round; a frightful earthquake shook the\r\nnew-formed cone, and showers of stones were thrown as far as Umnack. The\r\neruption continued for several months, and eight years afterwards, in\r\n1804, when it was explored by some hunters, the soil was so hot in some\r\nplaces that they could not walk on it. According to Langsdorf and\r\nothers, this new island, which is now several thousand feet high, and\r\ntwo or three miles in circumference, has been continually found to have\r\nincreased in size when successively visited by different travellers; but\r\nwe have no accurate means of determining how much of its growth, if any,\r\nhas been due to upheaval, or how far it has been exclusively formed by\r\nthe ejection of ashes and streams of lava. It seems, however, to be well\r\nattested that earthquakes of the most terrific description agitate and\r\nalter the bed of the sea and surface of the land throughout this tract.\r\n\r\nThe line is continued in the southern extremity of the Peninsula of\r\nKamtschatka, where there are many active volcanoes, which, in some\r\neruptions, have scattered ashes to immense distances. The largest and\r\nmost active of these is Klutschew, lat. 56 degrees 3 minutes N., which\r\nrises at once from the sea to the prodigious height of 15,000 feet.\r\nWithin 700 feet of the summit, Erman saw, in 1829, a current of lava,\r\nemitting a vivid light, flow down the northwest side to the foot of the\r\ncone. A flow of lava from the summit of Mont Blanc to its base in the\r\nvalley of Chamouni would afford but an inadequate idea of the declivity\r\ndown which this current descended. Large quantities of ice and snow\r\nopposed for a time a barrier to the lava, until at length the fiery\r\ntorrent overcame, by its heat and pressure, this obstacle, and poured\r\ndown the mountain side with a frightful noise, which was heard for a\r\ndistance of more than fifty miles.[479]\r\n\r\nThe Kurile chain of islands constitutes the prolongation of the\r\nKamtschatka range, where a train of volcanic mountains, nine of which\r\nare known to have been in eruption, trends in a southerly direction. The\r\nline is then continued to the southwest in the great island of Jesso,\r\nand again in Nipon, the principal of the Japanese group. It then extends\r\nby Loo Choo and Formosa to the Philippine Islands, and thence by Sangir\r\nand the northeastern extremity of Celebes to the Moluccas (see map, fig.\r\n39). Afterwards it passes westward through Sumbawa to Java.\r\n\r\nThere are said to be thirty-eight considerable volcanoes in Java, some\r\nof which are more than 10,000 feet high. They are remarkable for the\r\nquantity of sulphur and sulphureous vapors which they discharge. They\r\nrarely emit lava, but rivers of mud issue from them, like the moya of\r\nthe Andes of Quito. The memorable eruption of Galongoon, in 1822, will\r\nbe described in the twenty-fifth chapter. The crater of Taschem, at the\r\neastern extremity of Java, contains a lake strongly impregnated with\r\nsulphuric acid, a quarter of a mile long, from which a river of acid\r\nwater issues, which supports no living creature, nor can fish live in\r\nthe sea near its confluence. There is an extinct crater near Batur,\r\ncalled Guevo Upas, or the Valley of Poison, about half a mile in\r\ncircumference, which is justly an object of terror to the inhabitants of\r\nthe country. Every living being which penetrates into this valley falls\r\ndown dead, and the soil is covered with the carcasses of tigers, deer,\r\nbirds, and even the bones of men; all killed by the abundant emanations\r\nof carbonic acid gas, by which the bottom of the valley is filled.\r\n\r\nIn another crater in this land of wonders, near the volcano of Talaga\r\nBodas, we learn from M. Reinwardt, that the sulphureous exhalations have\r\nkilled tigers, birds, and innumerable insects; and the soft parts of\r\nthese animals, such as the fibres, muscles, nails, hair, and skin,\r\nare very well preserved, while the bones are corroded, and entirely\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nWe learn from observations made in 1844, by Mr. Jukes, that a recent\r\ntertiary formation composed of limestone and resembling the coral rock\r\nof a fringing reef, clings to the flanks of all the volcanic islands\r\nfrom the east end of Timor to the west end of Java. These modern\r\ncalcareous strata are often white and chalk-like, sometimes 1000 feet\r\nand upwards above the sea, regularly stratified in thick horizontal\r\nbeds, and they show that there has been a general elevation of these\r\nislands at a comparatively modern period.[480]\r\n\r\nThe same linear arrangement which is observed in Java holds good in the\r\nvolcanoes of Sumatra, some of which are of great height, as Berapi,\r\nwhich is more than 12,000 feet above the sea, and is continually\r\nsmoking. Hot springs are abundant at its base. The volcanic line then\r\ninclines slightly to the northwest, and points to Barren Island, lat.\r\n12 degrees 15 minutes N., in the Bay of Bengal. This volcano was in\r\neruption in 1792, and will be described in the twenty-sixth chapter. The\r\nvolcanic train then extends, according to Dr. Macclelland, to the island\r\nof Narcondam, lat. 13 degrees. 22 minutes N., which is a cone seven or\r\neight hundred feet high, rising from deep water, and said to present\r\nsigns of lava currents descending from the crater to the base.\r\nAfterwards the train stretches in the same direction to the volcanic\r\nisland of Ramree, about lat. 19 degrees. N., and the adjoining island of\r\nCheduba, which is represented in old charts as a burning mountain. Thus\r\nwe arrive at the Chittagong coast, which in 1762 was convulsed by a\r\ntremendous earthquake (see chap. 29).[481]\r\n\r\nTo enumerate all the volcanic regions of the Indian and Pacific oceans\r\nwould lead me far beyond the proper limits of this treatise; but it will\r\nappear in the last chapter of this volume, when coral reefs are treated\r\nof, that the islands of the Pacific consist alternately of linear groups\r\nof two classes, the one lofty, and containing active volcanoes, and\r\nmarine strata above the sea-level, and which have been undergoing\r\nupheaval in modern times; the other very low, consisting of reefs of\r\ncoral, usually with lagoons in their centres, and in which there is\r\nevidence of a gradual subsidence of the ground. The extent and direction\r\nof these parallel volcanic bands have been depicted with great care by\r\nDarwin in his map before cited (p. 351).\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable theatre of volcanic activity in the Northern\r\nPacific--or, perhaps, in the whole world--occurs in the Sandwich\r\nIslands, which have been admirably treated of in a recent work by Mr.\r\nDana.[482]\r\n\r\n_Volcanic region from central Asia to the Azores._--Another great region\r\nof subterranean disturbance is that which has been imagined to extend\r\nthrough a large part of Central Asia to the Azores, that is to say,\r\nfrom China and Tartary through Lake Aral and the Caspian to the\r\nCaucasus, and the countries bordering the Black Sea, then again through\r\npart of Asia Minor to Syria, and westward to the Grecian Islands,\r\nGreece, Naples, Sicily, the southern part of Spain, Portugal and the\r\nAzores. Respecting the eastern extremity of this line in China, we have\r\nlittle information, but many violent earthquakes are known to have\r\noccurred there. The volcano said to have been in eruption in the seventh\r\ncentury in Central Tartary is situated on the northern declivity of the\r\nCelestial Mountains, not far distant from the large lake called\r\nIssikoul; and Humboldt mentions other vents and solfataras in the same\r\nquarter, which are all worthy of notice, as being far more distant from\r\nthe ocean (260 geographical miles) than any other known points of\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nWe find on the western shores of the Caspian, in the country round Baku,\r\na tract called the Field of Fire, which continually emits inflammable\r\ngas, while springs of naphtha and petroleum occur in the same vicinity,\r\nas also mud volcanoes. Syria and Palestine abound in volcanic\r\nappearances, and very extensive areas have been shaken, at different\r\nperiods, with great destruction of cities and loss of lives. Continual\r\nmention is made in history of the ravages committed by earthquakes in\r\nSidon, Tyre, Berytus, Laodicea, and Antioch, and in the Island of\r\nCyprus. The country around the Dead Sea appears evidently, from the\r\naccounts of modern travellers, to be volcanic. A district near Smyrna,\r\nin Asia Minor, was termed by the Greeks Catacecaumene, or \"the burnt\r\nup,\" where there is a large arid territory, without trees, and with a\r\ncindery soil.[483] This country was visited in 1841 by Mr. W. J.\r\nHamilton, who found in the valley of the Hermus perfect cones of scoriae,\r\nwith lava-streams, like those of Auvergne, conforming to the existing\r\nriver-channels, and with their surface undecomposed.[484]\r\n\r\n_Grecian Archipelago._--Proceeding westwards, we reach the Grecian\r\nArchipelago, where Santorin, afterwards to be described, is the grand\r\ncentre of volcanic action.\r\n\r\nIt was Von Buch's opinion that the volcanoes of Greece were arranged in\r\na line running N. N. W. and S. S. E., and that they afforded the only\r\nexample in Europe of active volcanoes having a linear direction; but M.\r\nVirlet, on the contrary, announces as the result of his investigations,\r\nmade during the French expedition to the Morea in 1829, that there is no\r\none determinate line of direction for the volcanic phenomena in Greece,\r\nwhether we follow the points of eruptions, or the earthquakes, or any\r\nother signs of igneous agency.[485]\r\n\r\nMacedonia, Thrace, and Epirus, have always been subject to earthquakes,\r\nand the Ionian Isles are continually convulsed.\r\n\r\nRespecting Southern Italy, Sicily, and the Lipari Isles, it is\r\nunnecessary to enlarge here, as I shall have occasion again to allude to\r\nthem. I may mention, however, that a band of volcanic action has been\r\ntraced by Dr. Daubeny across the Italian Peninsula, from Ischia to Mount\r\nVultur, in Apulia, the commencement of the line being found in the hot\r\nsprings of Ischia, after which it is prolonged through Vesuvius to the\r\nLago d'Ansanto, where gases similar to those of Vesuvius are evolved.\r\nIts farther extension strikes Mount Vultur, a lofty cone composed of\r\ntuff and lava, from one side of which carbonic acid and sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen are emitted.[486]\r\n\r\n_Traditions of deluges._--The traditions which have come down to us from\r\nremote ages of great inundations said to have happened in Greece and on\r\nthe confines of the Grecian settlements, had doubtless their origin in a\r\nseries of local catastrophes, caused principally by earthquakes. The\r\nfrequent migrations of the earlier inhabitants, and the total want of\r\nwritten annals long after the first settlement of each country, make it\r\nimpossible for us at this distance of time to fix either the true\r\nlocalities or probable dates of these events. The first philosophical\r\nwriters of Greece were, therefore, as much at a loss as ourselves to\r\noffer a reasonable conjecture on these points, or to decide how many\r\ncatastrophes might sometimes have become confounded in one tale, or how\r\nmuch this tale may have been amplified, in after times, or obscured by\r\nmythological fiction. The floods of Ogyges and Deucalion are commonly\r\nsaid to have happened before the Trojan war; that of Ogyges more than\r\nseventeen, and that of Deucalion more than fifteen centuries before our\r\nera. As to the Ogygian flood, it is generally described as having laid\r\nwaste Attica, and was referred by some writers to a great overflowing of\r\nrivers, to which cause Aristotle also attributed the deluge of\r\nDeucalion, which, he says, affected Hellas only, or the central part of\r\nThessaly. Others imagined the same event to have been due to an\r\nearthquake, which drew down masses of rock, and stopped up the course of\r\nthe Peneus in the narrow defile between mounts Ossa and Olympus.\r\n\r\nAs to the deluge of Samothrace, which is generally referred to a\r\ndistinct date, it appears that the shores of that small island and the\r\nadjoining mainland of Asia were inundated by the sea. Diodorus Siculus\r\nsays that the inhabitants had time to take refuge in the mountains, and\r\nsave themselves by flight; he also relates, that long after the event\r\nthe fishermen of the island drew up in their nets the capitals of\r\ncolumns, which were the remains of cities submerged by that terrible\r\ncatastrophe.[487] These statements scarcely leave any doubt that there\r\noccurred, at the period alluded to, a subsidence of the coast,\r\naccompanied by earthquakes and inroads of the sea. It is not impossible\r\nthat the story of the bursting of the Black Sea through the Thracian\r\nBosphorus into the Grecian Archipelago, which accompanied, and, as some\r\nsay, caused the Samothracian deluge, may have reference to a wave, or\r\nsuccession of waves, raised in the Euxine by the same convulsion.\r\n\r\nWe know that subterranean movements and volcanic eruptions are often\r\nattended not only by incursions of the sea, but also by violent rains,\r\nand the complete derangement of the river drainage of the inland\r\ncountry, and by the damming up of the outlets of lakes by landslips, or\r\nobstructions in the courses of subterranean rivers, such as abound in\r\nThessaly and the Morea. We need not therefore be surprised at the\r\nvariety of causes assigned for the traditional floods of Greece, by\r\nHerodotus, Aristotle, Diodorus, Strabo, and others. As to the area\r\nembraced, had all the Grecian deluges occurred simultaneously, instead\r\nof being spread over many centuries, and had they, instead of being\r\nextremely local, reached at once from the Euxine to the southwestern\r\nlimit of the Peloponnese, and from Macedonia to Rhodes, the devastation\r\nwould still have been more limited than that which visited Chili in\r\n1835, when a volcanic eruption broke out in the Andes, opposite Chiloe,\r\nand another at Juan Fernandez, distant 720 geographical miles, at the\r\nsame time that several lofty cones, in the Cordillera, 400 miles to the\r\neastward of that island, threw out vapor and ignited matter. Throughout\r\na great part of the space thus recently shaken in South America, cities\r\nwere laid in ruins, or the land was permanently upheaved, or mountainous\r\nwaves rolled inland from the Pacific.\r\n\r\n_Periodical alternation of Earthquakes in Syria and Southern Italy._--It\r\nhas been remarked by Von Hoff, that from the commencement of the\r\nthirteenth to the latter half of the seventeenth century, there was an\r\nalmost entire cessation of earthquakes in Syria and Judea; and, during\r\nthis interval of quiescence, the Archipelago, together with part of the\r\nadjacent coast of Lesser Asia, as also Southern Italy and Sicily,\r\nsuffered greatly from earthquakes; while volcanic eruptions were\r\nunusually frequent in the same regions. A more extended comparison,\r\nalso, of the history of the subterranean convulsions of these tracts\r\nseems to confirm the opinion, that a violent crisis of commotion never\r\nvisits both at the same time. It is impossible for us to declare, as\r\nyet, whether this phenomenon is constant in this and other regions,\r\nbecause we can rarely trace back a connected series of events farther\r\nthan a few centuries; but it is well known that, where numerous vents\r\nare clustered together within a small area, as in many archipelagoes for\r\ninstance, two of them are never in violent eruption at once. If the\r\naction of one becomes very great for a century or more, the others\r\nassume the appearance of spent volcanoes. It is, therefore, not\r\nimprobable that separate provinces of the same great range of volcanic\r\nfires may hold a relation to one deep-seated focus, analogous to that\r\nwhich the apertures of a small group bear to some more superficial rent\r\nor cavity. Thus, for example, we may conjecture that, at a comparatively\r\nsmall distance from the surface, Ischia and Vesuvius mutually\r\ncommunicate with certain fissures, and that each affords relief\r\nalternately to elastic fluids and lava there generated. So we may\r\nsuppose Southern Italy and Syria to be connected, at a much greater\r\ndepth, with a lower part of the very same system of fissures; in which\r\ncase any obstruction occurring in one duct may have the effect of\r\ncausing almost all the vapor and melted matter to be forced up the\r\nother, and if they cannot get vent, they may be the cause of violent\r\nearthquakes. Some objections advanced against this doctrine that\r\n\"volcanoes act as safety-valves,\" will be considered in the sequel.[488]\r\n\r\nThe northeastern portion of Africa, including Egypt, which lies six or\r\nseven degrees south of the volcanic line already traced, has been almost\r\nalways exempt from earthquakes; but the northwestern portion, especially\r\nFez and Morocco, which fall within the line, suffer greatly from time to\r\ntime. The southern part of Spain also, and Portugal, have generally been\r\nexposed to the same scourge simultaneously with Northern Africa. The\r\nprovinces of Malaga, Murcia, and Granada, and in Portugal the country\r\nround Lisbon, are recorded at several periods to have been devastated by\r\ngreat earthquakes. It will be seen, from Michell's account of the great\r\nLisbon shock, in 1755, that the first movement proceeded from the bed of\r\nthe ocean ten or fifteen leagues from the coast. So late as February 2,\r\n1816, when Lisbon was vehemently shaken, two ships felt a shock in the\r\nocean west from Lisbon; one of them at the distance of 120, and the\r\nother 262 French leagues from the coast[489]--a fact which is more\r\ninteresting, because a line drawn through the Grecian Archipelago, the\r\nvolcanic region of Southern Italy, Sicily, Southern Spain, and Portugal,\r\nwill, if prolonged westward through the ocean, strike the volcanic group\r\nof the Azores, which may possibly therefore have a submarine connection\r\nwith the European line.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the volcanic system of Southern Europe, it may be observed,\r\nthat there is a central tract where the greatest earthquakes prevail, in\r\nwhich rocks are shattered, mountains rent, the surface elevated or\r\ndepressed, and cities laid in ruins. On each side of this line of\r\ngreatest commotion there are parallel bands of country where the shocks\r\nare less violent. At a still greater distance (as in Northern Italy, for\r\nexample, extending to the foot of the Alps), there are spaces where the\r\nshocks are much rarer and more feeble, yet possibly of sufficient force\r\nto cause, by continued repetition, some appreciable alteration in the\r\nexternal form of the earth's crust. Beyond these limits, again, all\r\ncountries are liable to slight tremors, at distant intervals of time,\r\nwhen some great crisis of subterranean movement agitates an adjoining\r\nvolcanic region; but these may be considered as mere vibrations,\r\npropagated mechanically through the external covering of the globe, as\r\nsounds travel almost to indefinite distances through the air. Shocks of\r\nthis kind have been felt in England, Scotland, Northern France, and\r\nGermany--particularly during the Lisbon earthquake. But these countries\r\ncannot, on this account, be supposed to constitute parts of the southern\r\nvolcanic region, any more than the Shetland and Orkney islands can be\r\nconsidered as belonging to the Icelandic circle, because the sands\r\nejected from Hecla have been wafted thither by the winds.\r\n\r\nBesides the continuous spaces of subterranean disturbance, of which we\r\nhave merely sketched the outline, there are other disconnected volcanic\r\ngroups, of which several will be mentioned hereafter.\r\n\r\n_Lines of active and extinct Volcanoes not to be confounded._--We must\r\nalways be careful to distinguish between lines of extinct and active\r\nvolcanoes, even where they appear to run in the same direction; for\r\nancient and modern systems may interfere with each other. Already,\r\nindeed, we have proof that this is the case; so that it is not by\r\ngeographical position, but by reference to the species of organic beings\r\nalone, whether aquatic or terrestrial, whose remains occur in beds\r\ninterstratified with lavas, that we can clearly distinguish the relative\r\nage of volcanoes of which no eruptions are recorded. Had Southern Italy\r\nbeen known to civilized nations for as short a period as America, we\r\nshould have had no record of eruptions in Ischia; yet we might have\r\nassured ourselves that the lavas of that isle had flowed since the\r\nMediterranean was inhabited by the species of testacea now living in the\r\nNeapolitan seas. With this assurance, it would not have been rash to\r\ninclude the numerous vents of that island in the modern volcanic group\r\nof Campania.\r\n\r\nOn similar grounds we may infer, without much hesitation, that the\r\neruptions of Etna, and the modern earthquakes of Calabria, are a\r\ncontinuation of that action which, at a somewhat earlier period,\r\nproduced the submarine lavas of the Val di Noto in Sicily. But on the\r\nother hand, the lavas of the Euganean hills and the Vicentin, although\r\nnot wholly beyond the range of earthquakes in Northern Italy, must not\r\nbe confounded with any existing volcanic system; for when they flowed,\r\nthe seas were inhabited by animals almost all of them distinct from\r\nthose now known to live, whether in the Mediterranean or other parts of\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC DISTRICT OF NAPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  History of the volcanic eruptions in the district round\r\n    Naples--Early convulsions in the island of Ischia--Numerous cones\r\n    thrown up there--Lake Avernus--The Solfatara--Renewal of the\r\n    eruptions of Vesuvius, A.D. 79--Pliny's description of the\r\n    phenomena--His silence respecting the destruction of Herculaneum and\r\n    Pompeii--Subsequent history of Vesuvius--Lava discharged in Ischia\r\n    in 1302--Pause in the eruptions of Vesuvius--Monte Nuovo thrown\r\n    up--Uniformity of the volcanic operations of Vesuvius and Phlegraean\r\n    Fields in ancient and modern times.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall next give a sketch of the history of some of the volcanic vents\r\ndispersed throughout the great regions before described, and consider\r\nthe composition and arrangement of their lavas and ejected matter. The\r\nonly volcanic region known to the ancients was that of the\r\nMediterranean; and even of this they have transmitted to us very\r\nimperfect records relating to the eruptions of the three principal\r\ndistricts, namely, that round Naples, that of Sicily and its isles, and\r\nthat of the Grecian Archipelago. By far the most connected series of\r\nrecords throughout a long period relates to the first of these\r\nprovinces; and these cannot be too attentively considered, as much\r\nhistorical information is indispensable in order to enable us to obtain\r\na clear view of the connection and alternate mode of action of the\r\ndifferent vents in a single volcanic group.\r\n\r\n_Early convulsions in the Island of Ischia._---The Neapolitan volcanoes\r\nextend from Vesuvius, through the Phlegraean Fields, to Procida and\r\nIschia, in a somewhat linear arrangement, ranging from the northeast to\r\nthe southwest, as will be seen in the annexed map of the volcanic\r\ndistrict of Naples (fig. 40). Within the space above limited, the\r\nvolcanic force is sometimes developed in single eruptions from a\r\nconsiderable number of irregularly scattered points; but a great part of\r\nits action has been confined to one principal and habitual vent,\r\nVesuvius or Somma. Before the Christian era, from the remotest periods\r\nof which we have any tradition, this principal vent was in a state of\r\ninactivity. But terrific convulsions then took place from time to time\r\nin Ischia (Pithecusa), and seem to have extended to the neighboring isle\r\nof Procida (Prochyta); for Strabo[490] mentions a story of Procida\r\nhaving been torn asunder from Ischia; and Pliny[491] derives its name\r\nfrom its having been poured forth by an eruption from Ischia.\r\n\r\nThe present circumference of Ischia along the water's edge is eighteen\r\nmiles, its length from west to east about five, and its breadth from\r\nnorth to south three miles. Several Greek colonies which settled there\r\nbefore the Christian era were compelled to abandon it in consequence of\r\nthe violence of the eruptions. First the Erythraeans, and afterwards the\r\nChalcidians, are mentioned as having been driven out by earthquakes and\r\nigneous exhalations. A colony was afterwards established by Hiero, king\r\nof Syracuse, about 380 years before the Christian era; but when they had\r\nbuilt a fortress, they were compelled by an eruption to fly, and never\r\nagain returned. Strabo tells us that Timaeus recorded a tradition, that,\r\na little before his time, Epomeus, the principal mountain in the centre\r\nof the island, vomited fire during great earthquakes; that the land\r\nbetween it and the coast had ejected much fiery matter, which flowed\r\ninto the sea, and that the sea receded for the distance of three stadia,\r\nand then returning, overflowed the island. This eruption is supposed by\r\nsome to have been that which formed the crater of Monte Corvo on one of\r\nthe higher flanks of Epomeo, above Foria, the lava-current of which may\r\nstill be traced, by aid of the scoriae on its surface, from the crater to\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC DISTRICT OF NAPLES.\r\n\r\nA. Astroni. B. Monte Barbaro. M. Monte Nuovo. S. The Solfatara.]\r\n\r\nTo one of the subsequent eruptions in the lower parts of the isle, which\r\ncaused the expulsion of the first Greek colony, Monte Rotaro has been\r\nattributed, and it bears every mark of recent origin. The cone, which I\r\nexamined in 1828, is remarkably perfect, and has a crater on its summit\r\nprecisely resembling that of Monte Nuovo near Naples; but the hill is\r\nlarger, and resembles some of the more considerable cones of single\r\neruption near Clermont in Auvergne, and, like some of them, it has given\r\nvent to a lava-stream at its base, instead of its summit. A small ravine\r\nswept out by a torrent exposes the structure of the cone, which is\r\ncomposed of innumerable inclined and slightly undulating layers of\r\npumice, scoriae, white lapilli, and enormous angular blocks of trachyte.\r\nThese last have evidently been thrown out by violent explosions, like\r\nthose which in 1822 launched from Vesuvius a mass of augitic lava, of\r\nmany tons' weight, to the distance of three miles, which fell in the\r\ngarden of Prince Ottajano. The cone of Rotaro is covered with the\r\narbutus, and other beautiful evergreens. Such is the strength of the\r\nvirgin soil, that the shrubs have become almost arborescent; and the\r\ngrowth of some of the smaller wild plants has been so vigorous, that\r\nbotanists have scarcely been able to recognize the species.\r\n\r\nThe eruption which dislodged the Syracusan colony is supposed to have\r\ngiven rise to that mighty current which forms the promontory of Zaro and\r\nCaruso. The surface of these lavas is still very arid and bristling, and\r\nis covered with black scoriae; so that it is not without great labor that\r\nhuman industry has redeemed some small spots, and converted them into\r\nvineyards. Upon the produce of these vineyards the population of the\r\nisland is almost entirely supported. It amounted when I was there, in\r\n1828, to about twenty-five thousand, and was on the increase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 41.\r\n\r\nPart of Ischia seen from the West.\r\n\r\n_a._ Monte Epomeo or San Niccola.\r\n\r\n_b._ Monte Vico.\r\n\r\n_c._ Another of the minor cones with a crater.[492]]\r\n\r\nFrom the date of the great eruption last alluded to, down to our own\r\ntime, Ischia has enjoyed tranquillity, with the exception of one\r\nemission of lava hereafter to be described, which, although it\r\noccasioned much local damage, does not appear to have devastated the\r\nwhole country, in the manner of more ancient explosions. There are, upon\r\nthe whole, on different parts of Epomeo, or scattered through the lower\r\ntracts of Ischia, twelve considerable volcanic cones which have been\r\nthrown up since the island was raised above the surface of the deep; and\r\nmany streams of lava may have flowed, like that of \"Arso\" in 1302,\r\nwithout cones having been produced; so that this island may, for ages\r\nbefore the period of the remotest traditions, have served as a\r\nsafety-valve to the whole Terra di Lavoro, while the fires of Vesuvius\r\nwere dormant.\r\n\r\n_Lake Avernus._--It seems also clear that Avernus, a circular lake near\r\nPuzzuoli, about half a mile in diameter, which is now a salubrious and\r\ncheerful spot, once exhaled mephitic vapors, such as are often emitted\r\nby craters after eruptions. There is no reason for discrediting the\r\naccount of Lucretius, that birds could not fly over it without being\r\nstifled, although they may now frequent it uninjured.[493] There must\r\nhave been a time when this crater was in action; and for many centuries\r\nafterwards it may have deserved the appellation of \"atri jauna Ditis,\"\r\nemitting, perhaps, gases as destructive of animal life as those\r\nsuffocating vapors given out by Lake Quilotoa, in Quito, in 1797, by\r\nwhich whole herds of cattle on its shores were killed,[494] or as those\r\ndeleterious emanations which annihilated all the cattle in the island of\r\nLancerote, one of the Canaries, in 1730.[495] Bory St. Vincent mentions,\r\nthat in the same isle birds fell lifeless to the ground; and Sir William\r\nHamilton informs us that he picked up dead birds on Vesuvius during an\r\neruption.\r\n\r\n_Solfatara._--The Solfatara, near Puzzuoli, which may be considered as a\r\nnearly extinguished crater, appears, by the accounts of Strabo and\r\nothers, to have been before the Christian era in very much the same\r\nstate as at present, giving vent continually to aqueous vapor, together\r\nwith sulphureous and muriatic acid gases, like those evolved by\r\nVesuvius.\r\n\r\n_Ancient history of Vesuvius._--Such, then, were the points where the\r\nsubterranean fires obtained vent, from the earliest period to which\r\ntradition reaches back, down to the first century of the Christian era;\r\nbut we then arrive at a crisis in the volcanic action of this\r\ndistrict--one of the most interesting events witnessed by man during the\r\nbrief period throughout which he has observed the physical changes on\r\nthe earth's surface. From the first colonization of Southern Italy by\r\nthe Greeks, Vesuvius afforded no other indications of its volcanic\r\ncharacter than such as the naturalist might infer, from the analogy of\r\nits structure to other volcanoes. These were recognized by Strabo, but\r\nPliny did not include the mountain in his list of active vents. The\r\nancient cone was of a very regular form, terminating not as at present\r\nin two peaks, but with a summit which presented, when seen from a\r\ndistance, the even outline of an abruptly truncated cone. On the summit,\r\nas we learn from Plutarch, there was a crater with steep cliffs, and\r\nhaving its interior overgrown with wild vines, and with a sterile plain\r\nat the bottom. On the exterior, the flanks of the mountain were clothed\r\nwith fertile fields richly cultivated, and at its base were the populous\r\ncities of Herculaneum and Pompeii. But the scene of repose was at length\r\ndoomed to cease, and the volcanic fire was recalled to the main channel,\r\nwhich at some former unknown period had given passage to repeated\r\nstreams of melted lava, sand, and scoriae.\r\n\r\n_Renewal of its eruptions._--The first symptom of the revival of the\r\nenergies of this volcano was the occurrence of an earthquake in the year\r\n63 after Christ, which did considerable injury to the cities in its\r\nvicinity. From that time to the year 79 slight shocks were frequent; and\r\nin the month of August of that year they became more numerous and\r\nviolent, till they ended at length in an eruption. The elder Pliny, who\r\ncommanded the Roman fleet, was then stationed at Misenum; and in his\r\nanxiety to obtain a near view of the phenomena, he lost his life, being\r\nsuffocated by sulphureous vapors. His nephew, the younger Pliny,\r\nremained at Misenum, and has given us, in his Letters, a lively\r\ndescription of the awful scene. A dense column of vapor was first seen\r\nrising vertically from Vesuvius, and then spreading itself out\r\nlaterally, so that its upper portion resembled the head, and its lower\r\nthe trunk of the pine, which characterizes the Italian landscape. This\r\nblack cloud was pierced occasionally by flashes of fire, as vivid as\r\nlightning, succeeded by darkness more profound than night. Ashes fell\r\neven upon the ships at Misenum, and caused a shoal in one part of the\r\nsea--the ground rocked, and the sea receded from the shores, so that\r\nmany marine animals were seen on the dry sand. The appearances above\r\ndescribed agree perfectly with those witnessed in more recent eruptions,\r\nespecially those of Monte Nuovo, in 1538, and of Vesuvius in 1822.\r\n\r\nThe younger Pliny, although giving a circumstantial detail of so many\r\nphysical facts, and describing the eruption and earthquake, and the\r\nshower of ashes which fell at Stabiae, makes no allusion to the sudden\r\noverwhelming of two large and populous cities, Herculaneum and Pompeii.\r\nIn explanation of this omission, it has been suggested that his chief\r\nobject was simply to give Tacitus a full account of the particulars of\r\nhis uncle's death. It is worthy, however, of remark, that had the buried\r\ncities never been discovered, the accounts transmitted to us of their\r\ntragical end might well have been discredited by the majority, so vague\r\nand general are the narratives, or so long subsequent to the event.\r\nTacitus, the friend and contemporary of Pliny, when adverting in general\r\nterms to the convulsions, says merely that \"cities were consumed or\r\nburied.\"[496]\r\n\r\nSuetonius, although he alludes to the eruption incidentally, is silent\r\nas to the cities. They are mentioned by Martial, in an epigram, as\r\nimmersed in cinders; but the first historian who alludes to them by name\r\nis Dion Cassius,[497] who flourished about a century and a half after\r\nPliny. He appears to have derived his information from the traditions of\r\nthe inhabitants, and to have recorded, without discrimination, all the\r\nfacts and fables which he could collect. He tells us, \"that during the\r\neruption a multitude of men of superhuman stature, resembling giants,\r\nappeared, sometimes on the mountain, and sometimes in the environs--that\r\nstones and smoke were thrown out, the sun was hidden, and then the\r\ngiants seemed to rise again, while the sounds of trumpets were heard,\r\n&c., &c.; and finally,\" he relates, \"two entire cities, Herculaneum and\r\nPompeii, were buried under showers of ashes, while all the people were\r\nsitting in the theatre.\" That many of these circumstances were invented,\r\nwould have been obvious, even without the aid of Pliny's letters; and\r\nthe examination of Herculaneum and Pompeii enables us to prove, that\r\nnone of the people were destroyed in the theatres, and indeed that there\r\nwere very few of the inhabitants who did not escape from both cities.\r\nYet some lives were lost, and there was ample foundation for the tale in\r\nits most essential particulars.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that in the year 79 any lava flowed from Vesuvius;\r\nthe ejected substances, perhaps, consisted entirely of lapilli, sand,\r\nand fragments of older lava, as when Monte Nuovo was thrown up in 1538.\r\nThe first era at which we have authentic accounts of the flowing of a\r\nstream of lava, is the year 1036, which is the seventh eruption from the\r\nrevival of the fires of the volcano. A few years afterwards, in 1049,\r\nanother eruption is mentioned, and another in 1138 (or 1139), after\r\nwhich a great pause ensued of 168 years. During this long interval of\r\nrepose, two minor vents opened at distant points. First, it is on\r\ntradition that an eruption took place from the Solfatara, in the year\r\n1198, during the reign of Frederick II., Emperor of Germany; and\r\nalthough no circumstantial detail of the event has reached us from those\r\ndark ages, we may receive the fact without hesitation.[498] Nothing\r\nmore, however, can be attributed to this eruption, as Mr. Scrope\r\nobserves, than the discharge of a light and scoriform trachytic lava, of\r\nrecent aspect, resting upon the strata of loose tuff which covers the\r\nprincipal mass of trachyte.[499]\r\n\r\n_Volcanic eruption in Ischia_, 1302.--The other occurrence is well\r\nauthenticated--the eruption, in the year 1302, of a lava-stream from a\r\nnew vent on the southeast end of the Island of Ischia. During part of\r\n1301, earthquakes had succeeded one another with fearful rapidity; and\r\nthey terminated at last with the discharge of a lava-stream from a point\r\nnamed the Campo del Arso, not far from the town of Ischia. This lava ran\r\nquite down to the sea--a distance of about two miles; in color it varies\r\nfrom iron-gray to reddish black, and is remarkable for the glassy\r\nfelspar which it contains. Its surface is almost as sterile, after a\r\nperiod of five centuries, as if it had cooled down yesterday. A few\r\nscantlings of wild thyme, and two or three other dwarfish plants, alone\r\nappear in the interstices of the scoriae, while the Vesuvian lava of 1767\r\nis already covered with a luxuriant vegetation. Pontanus, whose\r\ncountry-house was burnt and overwhelmed, describes the dreadful scene as\r\nhaving lasted two months.[500] Many houses were swallowed up, and a\r\npartial emigration of the inhabitants followed. This eruption produced\r\nno cone, but only a slight depression, hardly deserving the name of a\r\ncrater, where heaps of black and red scoriae lie scattered around. Until\r\nthis eruption, Ischia is generally believed to have enjoyed an interval\r\nof rest for about seventeen centuries; but Julius Obsequens,[501] who\r\nflourished A. D. 214, refers to some volcanic convulsions in the year\r\n662 after the building of Rome (91 B. C.) As Pliny, who lived a century\r\nbefore Obsequens, does not enumerate this among other volcanic\r\neruptions, the statement of the latter author is supposed to have been\r\nerroneous; but it would be more consistent, for reasons before stated,\r\nto disregard the silence of Pliny, and to conclude, that some kind of\r\nsubterranean commotion, probably of no great violence, happened at the\r\nperiod alluded to.\r\n\r\n_History of Vesuvius after_ 1138.--To return to Vesuvius:--the next\r\neruption occurred in 1306; between which era and 1631 there was only one\r\nother (in 1500), and that a slight one. It has been remarked, that\r\nthroughout this period Etna was in a state of such unusual activity, as\r\nto lend countenance to the idea that the great Sicilian volcano may\r\nsometimes serve as a channel of discharge to elastic fluids and lava\r\nthat would otherwise rise to the vents in Campania.\r\n\r\n_Formation of Monte Nuovo_, 1538.--The great pause was also marked by a\r\nmemorable event in the Phlegraean Fields--the sudden formation of a new\r\nmountain in 1538, of which we have received authentic accounts from\r\ncontemporary writers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 42.\r\n\r\n  Monte Nuovo, formed in the Bay of Baiae, Sept. 29th, 1538.\r\n\r\n  1. Cone of Monte Nuovo.\r\n  2. Brim of crater of ditto.\r\n  3. Thermal spring, called Baths of Nero, or Stufe di Tritoli.\r\n\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe height of this mountain, called ever since Monte Nuovo, has been\r\ndetermined by the Italian mineralogist Pini, to be 440 English feet\r\nabove the level of the bay; its base is about eight thousand feet, or\r\nmore than a mile and a half in circumference. According to Pini, the\r\ndepth of the crater is 421 English feet from the summit of the hill, so\r\nthat its bottom is only nineteen feet above the level of the sea. The\r\ncone is declared, by the best authorities, to stand partly on the site\r\nof the Lucrine Lake (4, fig. 43),[502] which was nothing more than the\r\ncrater of a pre-existent volcano, and was almost entirely filled during\r\nthe explosion of 1538. Nothing now remains but a shallow pool, separated\r\nfrom the sea by an elevated beach, raised artificially.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.\r\n\r\nThe Phlegraean Fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.

Bay of Baiae.\r\n\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nSir William Hamilton has given us two original letters describing this\r\neruption. The first, by Falconi, dated 1538, contains the following\r\npassages.[503] \"It is now two years since there have been frequent\r\nearthquakes at Puzzuoli, Naples, and the neighboring parts. On the day\r\nand in the night before the eruption (of Monte Nuovo), above twenty\r\nshocks, great and small, were felt. The eruption began on the 29th of\r\nSeptember, 1538. It was on a Sunday, about one o'clock in the night,\r\nwhen flames of fire were seen between the hot baths and Tripergola. In a\r\nshort time the fire increased to such a degree, that it burst open the\r\nearth in this place, and threw up so great a quantity of ashes and\r\npumice-stones, mixed with water, as covered the whole country. The next\r\nmorning (after the formation of Monte Nuovo) the poor inhabitants of\r\nPuzzuoli quitted their habitations in terror, covered with the muddy and\r\nblack shower which continued the whole day in that country--flying from\r\ndeath, but with death painted in their countenances. Some with their\r\nchildren in their arms, some with sacks full of their goods; others\r\nleading an ass, loaded with their frightened family, towards Naples;\r\nothers carrying quantities of birds, of various sorts, that had fallen\r\ndead at the beginning of the eruption; others, again, with fish which\r\nthey had found, and which were to be met with in plenty on the shore,\r\nthe sea having left them dry for a considerable time. I accompanied\r\nSignor Moramaldo to behold the wonderful effects of the eruption. The\r\nsea had retired on the side of Baiae, abandoning a considerable tract,\r\nand the shore appeared almost entirely dry, from the quantity of ashes\r\nand broken pumice-stones thrown up by the eruption. I saw two springs in\r\nthe newly discovered ruins; one before the house that was the queen's,\r\nof hot and salt water,\" &c.\r\n\r\nSo far Falconi: the other account is by Pietro Giacomo di Toledo, which\r\nbegins thus:--\"It is now two years since this province of Campagna has\r\nbeen afflicted with earthquakes, the country about Puzzuoli much more so\r\nthan any other parts; but the 27th and the 28th of the month of\r\nSeptember last, the earthquakes did not cease day or night in the town\r\nof Puzzuoli: that plain which lies between Lake Avernus, the Monte\r\nBarbaro, and the sea, was _raised a little_, and many cracks were made\r\nin it, from some of which issued water; at the same time the sea,\r\nimmediately joining the plain, _dried up about two hundred paces_, so\r\nthat the fish were left on the sand a prey to the inhabitants of\r\nPuzzuoli. At last, on the 29th of the same month, about two o'clock in\r\nthe night, the earth opened near the lake, and discovered a horrid\r\nmouth, from which were vomited furiously smoke, fire, stones, and mud,\r\ncomposed of ashes, making at the time of its opening a noise like the\r\nloudest thunder. The stones which followed were by the flames converted\r\nto pumice, and some of these were _larger than an ox_. The stones went\r\nabout as high as a cross-bow can carry, and then fell down, sometimes on\r\nthe edge, and sometimes into the mouth itself. The mud was of the color\r\nof ashes, and at first very liquid, then by degrees less so, and in such\r\nquantities, that in less than twelve hours, with the help of the\r\nabove-mentioned stones, a mountain was raised of 1000 paces in height.\r\nNot only Puzzuoli and the neighboring country was full of this mud, but\r\nthe city of Naples also; so that many of its palaces were defaced by it.\r\nNow this eruption lasted two nights and two days without intermission,\r\nthough, it is true, not always with the same force; the third day the\r\neruption ceased, and I went up with many people to the top of the new\r\nhill, and saw down into its mouth, which was a round cavity about a\r\nquarter of a mile in circumference, in the middle of which, the stones\r\nwhich had fallen were boiling up, just as a caldron of water boils on\r\nthe fire. The fourth day it began to throw up again, and the seventh\r\nmuch more, but still with less violence than the first night. At this\r\ntime many persons who were on the hill were knocked down by the stones\r\nand killed, or smothered with the smoke. In the day the smoke still\r\ncontinues, and you often see fire in the midst of it in the\r\nnighttime.\"[504]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that both these accounts, written immediately after the\r\nbirth of Monte Nuovo, agree in stating that the sea retired; and one\r\nmentions that its bottom was upraised; but they attribute the origin of\r\nthe new hill exclusively to the jets of mud, showers of scoriae, and\r\nlarge fragments of rock, cast out from a central orifice, for several\r\ndays and nights. Baron Von Buch, however, in his excellent work on the\r\nCanary Islands, and volcanic phenomena in general, has declared his\r\nopinion that the cone and crater of Monte Nuovo were formed, not in the\r\nmanner above described, but by the upheaval of solid beds of white tuff,\r\nwhich were previously horizontal, but which were pushed up in 1538, so\r\nas to dip away in all directions from the centre, with the same\r\ninclination as the sloping surface of the cone itself. \"It is an error,\"\r\nhe says, \"to imagine that this hill was formed by eruption, or by the\r\nejection of pumice, scoriae, and other incoherent matter; for the solid\r\nbeds of upraised tuff are visible all round the crater, and it is merely\r\nthe superficial covering of the cone which is made up of ejected\r\nscoriae.\"[505]\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of this view, M. Dufranoy has cited a passage from the\r\nworks of Porzio, a celebrated physician of that period, to prove that in\r\n1538 the ground where Monte Nuovo stands was pushed up in the form of a\r\ngreat bubble or blister, which on bursting, gave origin to the present\r\ndeep crater. Porzio, says, \"that after two days and nights of violent\r\nearthquakes, the sea retired for nearly 200 yards; so that the\r\ninhabitants could collect great numbers of fish on this part of the\r\nshore, and see some springs of fresh water which rose up there. At\r\nlength, on the third day of the calends of October (September 29), they\r\nsaw a large tract of ground intervening between the foot of Monte\r\nBarbaro, and part of the sea, near the Lake Avernus, rise, and suddenly\r\nassume the form of an incipient hill; and at two o'clock at night, this\r\nheap of earth, opening as it were its mouth, vomited, with a loud noise,\r\nflames, pumice-stones, and ashes.\"[506]\r\n\r\nSo late as the year 1846 a fourth manuscript (written immediately after\r\nthe eruption) was discovered and published in Germany. It was written in\r\n1538 by Francesco del Nero,[507] who mentions the drying up of the bed\r\nof the sea near Puzzuoli, which enabled the inhabitants of the town to\r\ncarry off loads of fish. About eight o'clock in the morning of the 29th\r\nSeptember, the earth sunk down about 14 feet in that place where the\r\nvolcanic orifice now appears, and there issued forth a small stream of\r\nwater, at first cold, and afterwards tepid. At noon, on the same day,\r\nthe earth began to swell up in the same spot where it had sunk down 14\r\nfeet, so as to form a hill. About this time fire issued forth, and gave\r\nrise to the great gulf, \"with such a force, noise, and shining light,\r\nthat I, who was standing in my garden, was seized with terror. Forty\r\nminutes afterwards, although unwell, I got upon a neighboring height,\r\nfrom which I saw all that took place, and by my troth it was a splendid\r\nfire, that threw up for a long time much earth and many stones, which\r\nfell back again all round the gulf, in a semicircle of from one to three\r\nbow-shots in diameter, and, filling up part of the sea, formed a hill\r\nnearly of the height of Monte Morello. Masses of earth and stones, as\r\nlarge as an ox, were shot up from the fiery gulf into the air, to a\r\nheight which I estimate at a mile and a half. When they descended, some\r\nwere dry, others in a soft muddy state.\" He concludes by alluding again\r\nto the sinking of the ground, and the elevation of it which followed,\r\nand says that to him it was inconceivable how such a mass of stones and\r\nashes could have been poured forth from the gulf. He also refers to the\r\naccount which Porzio was to draw up for the Viceroy.\r\n\r\nOn comparing these four accounts, recorded by eye-witnesses, there\r\nappears to be no real discrepancy between them. It seems clear that the\r\nground first sunk down 14 feet on the site of the future volcano, and\r\nafter having subsided it was again propelled upwards by the lava mingled\r\nwith steam and gases, which were about to burst forth. Jets of red-hot\r\nlava, fragments of fractured rock, and occasionally mud composed of a\r\nmixture of pumice, tuff, and sea-water, were hurled into the air. Some\r\nof the blocks of stone were very large, leading us to infer that the\r\nground which sank and rose again was much shattered and torn to pieces\r\nby the elastic vapors. The whole hill was not formed at once, but by an\r\nintermittent action extending over a week or more. It seems that the\r\nchasm opened between Tripergola and the baths in its suburbs, and that\r\nthe ejected materials fell and buried that small town. A considerable\r\npart, however, of the hill was formed in less than twenty-four hours,\r\nand in the same manner as on a smaller scale the mud cones of the air\r\nvolcanoes are produced, with a cavity in the middle. There is no\r\ndifficulty in conceiving that the pumiceous mud, if so thrown out, may\r\nhave set into a kind of stone on drying, just as some cements, composed\r\nof volcanic ashes, are known to consolidate with facility.\r\n\r\nI am informed that Baron Von Buch discovered some marine shells of\r\nexisting species, such as occur fossil in the tuff of the neighborhood,\r\nin beds exposed low down in the walls of the crater of Monte Nuovo.\r\nThese may have been ejected in the mud mixed with sea-water which was\r\ncast out of the boiling gulf; or, as Signor Arcangelo Scacchi has\r\nsuggested,[508] they may have been derived from the older tuff, which\r\ncontains marine shells of recent species. The same observer remarks that\r\nPorzio's account upon the whole corroborates the doctrine of the cone\r\nhaving been formed by eruption, in proof of which he cites the\r\nfollowing passage:--\"But what was truly astonishing, a hill of\r\npumice-stones and ashes was heaped up round the gulf to the height of a\r\nmile in a single night.\"[509] Signor Scacchi also adds that the ancient\r\ntemple of Apollo, now at the foot of Monte Nuovo, and the walls of which\r\nstill retain their perfect perpendicularity, could not possibly have\r\nmaintained that position had the cone of Monte Nuovo really been the\r\nresult of upheaval.\r\n\r\nTripergola was much frequented as a watering-place, and contained a\r\nhospital for those who resorted there for the benefit of the thermal\r\nsprings; and it appears that there were no fewer than three inns in the\r\nprincipal street. Had Porzio stated that any of these buildings, or the\r\nruins of them, were seen by himself or others raised up above the plain,\r\na short time before the first eruption, so as to stand on the summit or\r\nslope of a newly-raised hillock, we might have been compelled, by so\r\ncircumstantial a narrative, to adopt M. Dufranoy's interpretation.\r\n\r\nBut in the absence of such evidence, we must appeal to the crater\r\nitself, where we behold a section of the whole mountain, without being\r\nable to detect any original nucleus of upheaved rock distinct from the\r\nrest; on the contrary, the whole mass is similar throughout in\r\ncomposition, and the cone very symmetrical in form; nor are there any\r\nclefts, such as might be looked for, as the effect of the sudden upthrow\r\nof stony masses. M. C. Prevost has well remarked, that if beds of solid\r\nand non-elastic materials had yielded to a violent pressure directed\r\nfrom below upward, we should find not simply a deep empty cavity, but an\r\nirregular opening, where many rents converged; and these rents would be\r\nnow seen breaking through the walls of the crater, widening as they\r\napproach the centre. (See Fig. 44, _a_, _b_.)[510] Not a single fissure\r\nof this kind is observable in the interior of Monte Nuovo, where the\r\nwalls of the crater are continuous and entire; nor are there any dikes\r\nimplying that rents had existed, which were afterwards filled with lava\r\nor other matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.]\r\n\r\nIt has moreover been often urged by Von Buch, De Beaumont, and others,\r\nwho ascribe the conical form of volcanoes chiefly to upheaval from\r\nbelow, that in such mountains there are a great number of deep rents and\r\nravines, which diverge on all sides like the spokes of a wheel, from\r\nnear the central axis to the circumference or base of the cone, as in\r\nthe case of Palma, Cantal, and Teneriffe. Yet the entire absence of such\r\ndivergent fissures or ravines, in such cases as Monte Nuovo, Somma, or\r\nEtna, is passed by unnoticed, and appears to have raised in their minds\r\nno objection to their favorite theory.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, admitted by M. Dufranoy that there are some facts which\r\nit is very difficult to reconcile with his own view of Porzio's record.\r\nThus, for example, there are certain Roman monuments at the base of\r\nMonte Nuovo, and on the borders of Lake Avernus, such as the temples of\r\nApollo (before mentioned) and Pluto, which do not seem to have suffered\r\nin the least degree by the supposed upheaval. \"The walls which still\r\nexist have preserved their vertical position, and the vaults are in the\r\nsame state as other monuments on the shores of the Bay of Baiae. The long\r\ngallery which led to the Sibyl's Cave, on the other side of Lake\r\nAvernus, has in like manner escaped injury, the roof of the gallery\r\nremaining perfectly horizontal, the only change being that the soil of\r\nthe chamber in which the Sibyl gave out her oracles is now covered by a\r\nfew inches of water, which merely indicates a slight alteration in the\r\nlevel of Lake Avernus.\"[511] On the supposition, then, that pre-existing\r\nbeds of pumiceous tuff were upraised in 1538, so as to form Monte Nuovo,\r\nit is acknowledged that the perfectly undisturbed state of the\r\ncontiguous soil on which these ancient monuments stand, is very\r\ndifferent from what might have been expected.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, in his \"Volcanic Islands,\" has described several crateriform\r\nhills in the Galapagos Archipelago as composed of tuff which has\r\nevidently flowed like mud, and yet on consolidating has preserved an\r\ninclination of twenty and even thirty degrees. The tuff does not fold in\r\ncontinuous sheets round the hills as would have happened if they had\r\nbeen formed by the upheaval of horizontal layers. The author describes\r\nthe composition of the tuff as very similar to that of Monte Nuovo, and\r\nthe high angles at which the beds slope, both those which have flowed\r\nand those which have fallen in the form of ashes, entirely removes the\r\ndifficulty supposed by M. Dufranoy to exist in regard to the slope of\r\nMonte Nuovo, where it exceeds an angle of 18 degrees. to 20\r\ndegrees.[512] Mr. Dana, also, in his account of the Sandwich\r\nIslands,[513] shows that in the \"cinder cones\" of that region, the\r\nstrata have an original inclination of between 35 degrees and 40\r\ndegrees, while in the \"tufa cones\" formed near the sea, the beds slope\r\nat about an angle of 30 degrees. The same naturalist also observed in\r\nthe Samoan or Navigator Islands in Polynesia, that fragments of fresh\r\ncoral had been thrown up together with volcanic matter to the height of\r\n200 feet above the level of the sea in cones of tufa.[514]\r\n\r\nI shall again revert to the doctrine of the origin of volcanic cones by\r\nupheaval, when speaking of Vesuvius, Etna, and Santorin, and shall now\r\nmerely add, that, in 1538, the whole coast, from Monte Nuovo to beyond\r\nPuzzuoli, was upraised to the height of many feet above the bed of the\r\nMediterranean, and has since retained the greater part of the elevation\r\nthen acquired. The proofs of these remarkable changes of level will be\r\nconsidered at length when the phenomena of the temple of Serapis are\r\ndescribed.[515]\r\n\r\n_Volcanoes of the Phlegraean Fields._--Immediately adjoining Monte Nuovo\r\nis the larger volcanic cone of Monte Barbaro (2, fig. 43, p. 367), the\r\n\"Gaurus inanis\" of Juvenal--an appellation given to it probably from its\r\ndeep circular crater, which is about a mile in diameter. Large as is\r\nthis cone, it was probably produced by a single eruption; and it does\r\nnot, perhaps, exceed in magnitude some of the largest of those formed in\r\nIschia, within the historical era. It is composed chiefly of indurated\r\ntufa like Monte Nuovo, stratified conformably to its conical surface.\r\nThis hill was once very celebrated for its wines, and is still covered\r\nwith vineyards; but when the vine is not in leaf it has a sterile\r\nappearance, and, late in the year, when seen from the beautiful Bay of\r\nBaiae, it often contrasts so strongly in verdure with Monte Nuovo, which\r\nis always clothed with arbutus, myrtle, and other wild evergreens, that\r\na stranger might well imagine the cone of older date to be that thrown\r\nup in the sixteenth century.[516]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing, indeed, so calculated to instruct the geologist as the\r\nstriking manner in which the recent volcanic hills of Ischia, and that\r\nnow under consideration, blend with the surrounding landscape. Nothing\r\nseems wanting or redundant; every part of the picture is in such perfect\r\nharmony with the rest, that the whole has the appearance of having been\r\ncalled into existence by a single effort of creative power. Yet what\r\nother result could we have anticipated if nature has ever been governed\r\nby the same laws? Each new mountain thrown up--each new tract of land\r\nraised or depressed by earthquakes--should be in perfect accordance with\r\nthose previously formed, if the entire configuration of the surface has\r\nbeen due to a long series of similar disturbances. Were it true that the\r\ngreater part of the dry land originated simultaneously in its present\r\nstate, at some era of paroxysmal convulsion, and that additions were\r\nafterwards made slowly and successively during a period of comparative\r\nrepose; then, indeed, there might be reason to expect a strong line of\r\ndemarcation between the signs of the ancient and modern changes. But the\r\nvery continuity of the plan, and the perfect identity of the causes, are\r\nto many a source of deception; since by producing a unity of effect,\r\nthey lead them to exaggerate the energy of the agents which operated in\r\nthe earlier ages. In the absence of all historical information, they are\r\nas unable to separate the dates of the origin of different portions of\r\nour continents, as the stranger is to determine, by their physical\r\nfeatures alone, the distinct ages of Monte Nuovo, Monte Barbara,\r\nAstroni, and the Solfatara.\r\n\r\nThe vast scale and violence of the volcanic operations in Campania, in\r\nthe olden time, has been a theme of declamation, and has been contrasted\r\nwith the comparative state of quiescence of this delightful region in\r\nthe modern era. Instead of inferring, from analogy, that the ancient\r\nVesuvius was always at rest when the craters of the Phlegraean Fields\r\nwere burning--that each cone rose in succession,--and that many years,\r\nand often centuries, of repose intervened between different\r\neruptions,--geologists seem to have generally conjectured that the whole\r\ngroup sprung up from the ground at once, like the soldiers of Cadmus\r\nwhen he sowed the dragon's teeth. As well might they endeavor to\r\npersuade us that on these Phlegraean Fields, as the poets feigned, the\r\ngiants warred with Jove, ere yet the puny race of mortals were in being.\r\n\r\n_Modern eruptions of Vesuvius._--For nearly a century after the birth of\r\nMonte Nuovo, Vesuvius continued in a state of tranquillity. There had\r\nbeen no violent eruption for 492 years; and it appears that the crater\r\nwas then exactly in the condition of the present extinct volcano of\r\nAstroni, near Naples. Bracini, who visited Vesuvius not long before the\r\neruption of 1631, gives the following interesting description of the\r\ninterior:--\"The crater was five miles in circumference, and about a\r\nthousand paces deep: its sides were covered with brushwood, and at the\r\nbottom there was a plain on which cattle grazed. In the woody parts wild\r\nboars frequently harbored. In one part of the plain, covered with ashes,\r\nwere three small pools, one filled with hot and bitter water, another\r\nsalter than the sea, and a third hot, but tasteless.\"[517] But at length\r\nthese forests and grassy plains were consumed, being suddenly blown into\r\nthe air, and their ashes scattered to the winds. In December, 1631,\r\nseven streams of lava poured at once from the crater, and overflowed\r\nseveral villages, on the flanks and at the foot of the mountain. Resina,\r\npartly built over the ancient site of Herculaneum, was consumed by the\r\nfiery torrent. Great floods of mud were as destructive as the lava\r\nitself,--no uncommon occurrence during these catastrophes; for such is\r\nthe violence of rains produced by the evolutions of aqueous vapor, that\r\ntorrents of water descend the cone, and becoming charged with impalpable\r\nvolcanic dust, and rolling along loose ashes, acquire sufficient\r\nconsistency to deserve their ordinary appellation of \"aqueous lavas.\"\r\n\r\nA brief period of repose ensued, which lasted only until the year 1666,\r\nfrom which time to the present there has been a constant series of\r\neruptions, with rarely an interval of rest exceeding ten years. During\r\nthese three centuries, no irregular volcanic agency has convulsed other\r\npoints in this district. Brieslak remarked, that such irregular\r\nconvulsions had occurred in the Bay of Naples in every second century;\r\nas, for example, the eruption of the Solfatara, in the twelfth; of the\r\nlava of Arso, in Ischia, in the fourteenth; and of Monte Nuovo in the\r\nsixteenth; but the eighteenth has formed an exception to this rule, and\r\nthis seems accounted for by the unprecedented number of eruptions of\r\nVesuvius during that period; whereas, when the new vents opened, there\r\nhad always been, as we have seen, a long intermittence of activity in\r\nthe principal volcano.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC DISTRICT OF NAPLES--_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dimensions and structure of the cone of Vesuvius--Fluidity and\r\n    motion of lava--Dikes--Alluviums called \"aqueous lavas\"--Origin and\r\n    composition of the matter enveloping Herculaneum and\r\n    Pompeii--Condition and contents of the buried cities--Small number\r\n    of skeletons--State of preservation of animal and vegetable\r\n    substances--Rolls of papyrus--Stabiae--Torre del Greco--Concluding\r\n    remarks on the Campanian volcanoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Structure of the cone of Vesuvius._--Between the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury and the year 1822, the great crater of Vesuvius had been\r\ngradually filled by lava boiling up from below, and by scoriae falling\r\nfrom the explosions of minor mouths which were formed at intervals on\r\nits bottom and sides. In place of a regular cavity, therefore, there was\r\na rough and rocky plain, covered with blocks of lava and scoriae, and cut\r\nby numerous fissures, from which clouds of vapor were evolved. But this\r\nstate of things was totally changed by the eruption of October, 1822,\r\nwhen violent explosions, during the space of more than twenty days,\r\nbroke up and threw out all this accumulated mass, so as to leave an\r\nimmense gulf or chasm, of an irregular, but somewhat elliptical shape,\r\nabout three miles in circumference when measured along the very sinuous\r\nand irregular line of its extreme margin, but somewhat less than three\r\nquarters of a mile in its longest diameter, which was directed from N.\r\nE. to S. W.[518] The depth of this tremendous abyss has been variously\r\nestimated; for from the hour of its formation it increased daily by the\r\ndilapidation of its sides. It measured, at first, according to the\r\naccount of some authors, two thousand feet in depth from the extreme\r\npart of the existing summit;[519] but Mr. Scrope, when he saw it, soon\r\nafter the eruption, estimated its depth at less than half that amount.\r\nMore than eight hundred feet of the cone was carried away by the\r\nexplosions, so that the mountain was reduced in height from about 4200\r\nto 3400 feet.[520]\r\n\r\nAs we ascend the sloping sides, the volcano appears a mass of loose\r\nmaterials--a mere heap of rubbish, thrown together without the slightest\r\norder; but on arriving at the brim of the crater, and obtaining a view\r\nof the interior, we are agreeably surprised to discover that the\r\nconformation of the whole displays in every part the most perfect\r\nsymmetry and arrangement. The materials are disposed in regular strata,\r\nslightly undulating, appearing, when viewed in front, to be disposed in\r\nhorizontal planes. But, as we make the circuit of the edge of the\r\ncrater, and observe the cliffs by which it is encircled projecting or\r\nreceding in salient or retiring angles, we behold transverse sections of\r\nthe currents of lava and beds of sand and scoriae, and recognize their\r\ntrue dip. We then discover that they incline outwards from the axis of\r\nthe cone, at angles varying from 30 degrees. to 40 degrees. The whole\r\ncone, in fact, is composed of a number of concentric coatings of\r\nalternating lavas, sand, and scoriae. Every shower of ashes which has\r\nfallen from above, and every stream of lava descending from the lips of\r\nthe crater, have conformed to the outward surface of the hill, so that\r\none conical envelope may be said to have been successively folded round\r\nanother, until the aggregation of the whole mountain was completed. The\r\nmarked separation into distinct beds results from the different colors\r\nand degrees of coarseness in the sands, scoriae, and lava, and the\r\nalternation of these with each other. The greatest difficulty, on the\r\nfirst view, is to conceive how so much regularity can be produced,\r\nnotwithstanding the unequal distribution of sand and scoriae, driven by\r\nprevailing winds in particular eruptions, and the small breadth of each\r\nsheet of lava as it first flows out from the crater.\r\n\r\nBut, on a closer examination, we find that the appearance of extreme\r\nuniformity is delusive; for when a number of beds thin out gradually,\r\nand at different points, the eye does not without difficulty recognize\r\nthe termination of any one stratum, but usually supposes it continuous\r\nwith some other, which at a short distance may lie precisely in the same\r\nplane. The slight undulations, moreover, produced by inequalities on the\r\nsides of the hill on which the successive layers were moulded, assist\r\nthe deception. As countless beds of sand and scoriae constitute the\r\ngreater part of the whole mass, these may sometimes mantle continuously\r\nround the whole cone; and even lava streams may be of considerable\r\nbreadth when first they overflow, and since, in some eruptions, a\r\nconsiderable part of the upper portion of the cone breaks down at once,\r\nmay form a sheet extending as far as the space which the eye usually\r\ntakes in, in a single section.\r\n\r\nThe high inclination of some of the beds, and the firm union of the\r\nparticles even where there is evidently no cement, is another striking\r\nfeature in the volcanic tuffs and breccias, which seems at first not\r\nvery easy of explanation. But the last great eruption afforded ample\r\nillustration of the manner in which these strata are formed. Fragments\r\nof lava, scoriae, pumice, and sand, when they fall at slight distances\r\nfrom the summit, are only half cooled down from a state of fusion, and\r\nare afterwards acted upon by the heat from within, and by fumeroles or\r\nsmall crevices in the cone through which hot vapors are disengaged. Thus\r\nheated, the ejected fragments cohere together strongly; and the whole\r\nmass acquires such consistency in a few days, that fragments cannot be\r\ndetached without a smart blow of the hammer. At the same time sand and\r\nscoriae, ejected to a greater distance, remain incoherent.[521]\r\n\r\nSir William Hamilton, in his description of the eruption of 1779, says\r\nthat jets of liquid lava, mixed with stones and scoriae, were thrown up\r\nto the height of at least ten thousand feet, having the appearance of a\r\ncolumn of fire.[522] Some of these were directed by the winds towards\r\nOttajano, and some of them falling almost perpendicularly, still red-hot\r\nand liquid, on Vesuvius, covered its whole cone, part of the mountain of\r\nSomma, and the valley between them. The falling matter being nearly as\r\nvividly inflamed as that which was continually issuing fresh from the\r\ncrater, formed with it one complete body of fire, which could not be\r\nless than two miles and a half in breadth, and of the extraordinary\r\nheight above mentioned, casting a heat to the distance of at least six\r\nmiles round it. Dr. Clarke, also, in his account of the eruption of\r\n1793, says that millions of red-hot stones were shot into the air full\r\nhalf the height of the cone itself, and then bending, fell all round in\r\na fine arch. On another occasion he says that, as they fell, they\r\ncovered nearly half the cone with fire.\r\n\r\nThe same author has also described the different appearance of the lava\r\nat its source, and at some distance from it, when it had descended into\r\nthe plains below. At the point where it issued, in 1793, from an arched\r\nchasm in the side of the mountain, the vivid torrent rushed with the\r\nvelocity of a flood. It was in perfect fusion, unattended with any\r\nscoriae on its surface, or any gross materials not in a state of complete\r\nsolution. It flowed with the translucency of honey, \"in regular\r\nchannels, cut finer than art can imitate, and glowing with all the\r\nsplendor of the sun.\"--\"Sir William Hamilton,\" he continues, \"had\r\nconceived that no stones thrown upon a current of lava would make any\r\nimpression. I was soon convinced of the contrary. Light bodies, indeed,\r\nof five, ten, and fifteen pounds' weight, made little or no impression\r\neven at the source; but bodies of sixty, seventy, and eighty pounds were\r\nseen to form a kind of bed on the surface of the lava, and float away\r\nwith it. A stone of three hundred weight, that had been thrown out by\r\nthe crater, lay near the source of the current of lava: I raised it upon\r\none end, and then let it fall in upon the liquid lava; when it gradually\r\nsunk beneath the surface, and disappeared. If I wished to describe the\r\nmanner in which it acted upon the lava, I should say that it was like a\r\nloaf of bread thrown into a bowl of very thick honey, which gradually\r\ninvolves itself in the heavy liquid, and then slowly sinks to the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\n\"The lava, at a small distance from its source, acquires a darker tint\r\nupon its surface, is less easily acted upon, and, as the stream widens,\r\nthe surface, having lost its state of perfect solution, grows harder and\r\nharder, and cracks into innumerable fragments of very porous matter, to\r\nwhich they give the name of scoriae, and the appearance of which has led\r\nmany to suppose that it proceeded thus from the mountain. There is,\r\nhowever, no truth in this. All lava, at its first exit from its native\r\nvolcano, flows out in a liquid state, and all equally in fusion. The\r\nappearance of the scoriae is to be attributed only to the action of the\r\nexternal air, and not to any difference in the materials which compose\r\nit, since any lava whatever, separated from its channel, and exposed to\r\nthe action of the external air, immediately cracks, becomes porous, and\r\nalters its form. As we proceeded downwards, this became more and more\r\nevident; and the same lava which at its original source flowed in\r\nperfect solution, undivided, and free from incumbrances of any kind, a\r\nlittle farther down had its surface loaded with scoriae in such a manner,\r\nthat, upon its arrival at the bottom of the mountain, the whole current\r\nresembled nothing so much as a heap of unconnected cinders from an\r\niron-foundry.\" In another place he says that \"the rivers of lava in the\r\nplain resembled a vast heap of cinders, or the scoriae of an\r\niron-foundry, rolling slowly along, and falling with a rattling noise\r\nover one another.\"[523] Von Buch, who was in company with MM. de\r\nHumboldt and Gay-Lussac, describes the lava of 1805 (the most fluid on\r\nrecord) as shooting suddenly before their eyes from top to bottom of the\r\ncone in one single instant. Professor J. D. Forbes remarks that the\r\nlength of the slope of the cone proper being about 1300 feet, this\r\nmotion must correspond to a velocity of many hundred feet in a few\r\nseconds, without interpreting Von Buch's expression literally. The same\r\nlava, when it reached the level road at Torre del Greco, moved at the\r\nrate of only eighteen inches per minute, or three-tenths of an inch per\r\nsecond.[524] \"Although common lava,\" observes Professor Forbes, \"is\r\nnearly as liquid as melted iron, when it issues from the orifice of the\r\ncrater, its fluidity rapidly diminishes, and as it becomes more and more\r\nburdened by the consolidated slag through which it has to force its way,\r\nits velocity of motion diminishes in an almost inconceivable degree; and\r\nat length, when it ceases to present the slightest external trace of\r\nfluidity, its movement can only be ascertained by careful and repeated\r\nobservations, just as in the case of a glacier.\"[525]\r\n\r\nIt appears that the intensity of the light and heat of the lava varies\r\nconsiderably at different periods of the same eruption, as in that of\r\nVesuvius in 1819 and 1820, when Sir H. Davy remarked different degrees\r\nof vividness in the white heat at the point where the lava\r\noriginated.[526]\r\n\r\nWhen the expressions \"flame\" and \"smoke\" are used in describing volcanic\r\nappearances, they must generally be understood in a figurative sense. We\r\nare informed, indeed, by M. Abich, that he distinctly saw, in the\r\neruption of Vesuvius in 1834, the flame of burning hydrogen;[527] but\r\nwhat is usually mistaken for flame consists of vapor or scoriae, and\r\nimpalpable dust illuminated by that vivid light which is emitted from\r\nthe crater below, where the lava is said to glow with the splendor of\r\nthe sun. The clouds of apparent smoke are formed either of aqueous and\r\nother vapor, or of finely comminuted scoriae.\r\n\r\n_Dikes in the recent cone, how formed._--The inclined strata before\r\nmentioned which dip outwards in all directions from the axis of the cone\r\nof Vesuvius, are intersected by veins or dikes of compact lava, for the\r\nmost part in a vertical position. In 1828 these were seen to be about\r\nseven in number, some of them not less than four or five hundred feet in\r\nheight, and thinning out before they reached the uppermost part of the\r\ncone. Being harder than the beds through which they pass, they have\r\ndecomposed less rapidly, and therefore stand out in relief. When I\r\nvisited Vesuvius, in November, 1828, I was prevented from descending\r\ninto the crater by the constant ejections then thrown out; so that I got\r\nsight of three only of the dikes; but Signor Monticelli had previously\r\nhad drawings made of the whole, which he showed me. The dikes which I\r\nsaw were on that side of the cone which is encircled by Somma. The\r\neruption before mentioned, of 1828, began in March, and in the November\r\nfollowing the ejected matter had filled up nearly one-third of the deep\r\nabyss formed at the close of the eruption of 1822. In November I found a\r\nsingle black cone at the bottom of the crater continually throwing out\r\nscoriae, while on the exterior of the cone I observed the lava of 1822,\r\nwhich had flowed out six years before, not yet cool, and still evolving\r\nmuch heat and vapor from crevices.\r\n\r\nHoffmann, in 1832, saw on the north side of Vesuvius, near the peak\r\ncalled Palo, a great many parallel bands of lava, some from six to eight\r\nfeet thick, alternating with scoriae and conglomerate. These beds, he\r\nsays, were cut through by many dikes, some of them five feet broad. They\r\nresemble those of Somma, the stone being composed of grains of leucite\r\nand augite.[528]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the dikes above mentioned have been produced\r\nby the filling up of open fissures with liquid lava; but of the date of\r\ntheir formation we know nothing farther than that they are all\r\nsubsequent to the year 79, and, relatively speaking, that they are more\r\nmodern than all the lavas and scoriae which they intersect. A\r\nconsiderable number of the upper strata are not traversed by them. That\r\nthe earthquakes, which almost invariably precede eruptions, occasion\r\nrents in the mass, is well known; and, in 1822, three months before the\r\nlava flowed out, open fissures, evolving hot vapors, were numerous. It\r\nis clear that such rents must be ejected with melted matter when the\r\ncolumn of lava rises, so that the origin of the dikes is easily\r\nexplained, as also the great solidity and crystalline nature of the rock\r\ncomposing them, which has been formed by lava cooling slowly under great\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the frequent rending of volcanic cones during\r\neruptions may be connected with the gradual and successive upheaval of\r\nthe whole mass in such a manner as to increase the inclination of the\r\nbeds composing the cone; and in accordance with the hypothesis before\r\nproposed for the origin of Monte Nuovo, Von Buch supposes that the\r\npresent cone of Vesuvius was formed in the year 79, not by eruption, but\r\nby upheaval. It was not produced by the repeated superposition of scoriae\r\nand lava cast out or flowing from a central source, but by the uplifting\r\nof strata previously horizontal. The entire cone rose at once, such as\r\nwe now see it, from the interior and middle of Somma, and has since\r\nreceived no accession of height, but, on the contrary, has ever since\r\nbeen diminishing in elevation.[529]\r\n\r\nAlthough I consider this hypothesis of Von Buch to be quite untenable, I\r\nmay mention some facts which may at first sight seem to favor it. These\r\nare recorded by M. Abich in his account of the Vesuvian eruptions of\r\n1833 and 1834, a work illustrated by excellent engravings of the\r\nvolcanic phenomena which he witnessed.[530] It appears that, in the year\r\n1834, the great crater of Vesuvius had been filled up nearly to the top\r\nwith lava, which had consolidated and formed a level and unbroken plain,\r\nexcept that a small cone thrown up by the ejection of scoriae rose in the\r\nmiddle of it like an island in a lake. At length this plain of lava was\r\nbroken by a fissure which passed from N. E. to S. W., and along this\r\nline a great number of minute cones emitting vapor were formed. The\r\nfirst act of formation of these minor cones is said to have consisted of\r\na partial upheaval of beds of lava previously horizontal, and which had\r\nbeen rendered flexible by the heat and tension of elastic fluids, which,\r\nrising from below, escaped from the centre of each new monticule. There\r\nwould be considerable analogy between this mode of origin and that\r\nascribed by Von Buch to Vesuvius and Somma, if the dimensions of the\r\nupraised masses were not on so different a scale, and if it was safe to\r\nreason from the inflation of bladders of half-fused lava, from fifteen\r\nto twenty-five feet in height, to mountains attaining an altitude of\r\nseveral thousand feet, and having their component strata strengthened by\r\nintersecting dikes of solid lava.\r\n\r\nAt the same time M. Abich mentions, that when, in August, 1834, a great\r\nsubsidence took place in the platform of lava within the great crater,\r\nso that the structure of the central cone was laid open, it was seen to\r\nhave been evidently formed, _not by upheaval_, but by the fall of\r\ncinders and scoriae which had been thrown out during successive\r\neruptions.[531]\r\n\r\nPrevious to the year 79, Vesuvius appears, from the description of its\r\nfigure given by Strabo, to have been a truncated cone, having a level\r\nand even outline as seen from a distance. That it had a crater on its\r\nsummit, we may infer from a passage in Plutarch, on which Dr. Daubeny\r\nhas judiciously commented in his treatise on volcanoes.[532] The walls\r\nof the crater were evidently entire, except on one side, where there was\r\na single narrow breach. When Spartacus, in the year 72, encamped his\r\ngladiators in this hollow, Clodius, the praetor, besieged him there,\r\nkeeping the single outlet carefully guarded, and then let down his\r\nsoldiers by scaling-ladders over the steep precipices which surrounded\r\nthe crater, at the bottom of which the insurgents were encamped. On the\r\nside towards the sea, the walls of this original cavity, which must have\r\nbeen three miles in diameter, have been destroyed, and Brieslak was the\r\nfirst to announce the opinion, that this destruction happened during the\r\ntremendous eruption which occurred in 79, when the new cone, now called\r\nVesuvius, was thrown up, which stands encircled on three sides by the\r\nruins of the ancient cone, called Monte Somma.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.\r\n\r\nSupposed section of Vesuvius and Somma.\r\n\r\n_a_, Monte Somma, or the remains of the ancient cone of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\n_b_, The Pedamentina, a terrace-like projection, encircling the base of\r\nthe recent cone of Vesuvius on the south side.\r\n\r\n_c_, Atrio del Cavallo.[533]\r\n\r\n_d_, _e_, Crater left by eruption of 1822.\r\n\r\n_f_, Small cone thrown up in 1828, at the bottom of the great crater.\r\n\r\n_g_, _g_, Dikes intersecting Somma.\r\n\r\n_h_, _h_, Dikes intersecting the recent cone of Vesuvius.]\r\n\r\nIn the annexed diagram (fig. 45) it will be seen that on the side of\r\nVesuvius opposite to that where a portion of the ancient cone of Somma\r\n(_a_) still remains, is a projection (_b_) called the Pedamentina, which\r\nsome have supposed to be part of the circumference of the ancient crater\r\nbroken down towards the sea, and over the edge of which the lavas of the\r\nmodern Vesuvius have poured; the axis of the present cone of Vesuvius\r\nbeing, according to Visconti, precisely equidistant from the escarpment\r\nof Somma and the Pedamentina.\r\n\r\nIn the same diagram I have represented the slanting beds of the cone of\r\nVesuvius as becoming horizontal in the Atrio del Cavallo (at _c_), where\r\nthe base of the new cone meets the precipitous escarpment of Somma; for\r\nwhen the lava flows down to this point, as happened in 1822, its\r\ndescending course is arrested, and it then runs in another direction\r\nalong this small valley, circling round the base of the cone. Sand and\r\nscoriae, also, blown by the winds, collect at the base of the cone, and\r\nare then swept away by torrents; so that there is always here a flatish\r\nplain, as represented. In the same manner, the small interior cone\r\n(_f_) must be composed of sloping beds, terminating in a horizontal\r\nplain; for, while this monticule was gradually gaining height by\r\nsuccessive ejections of lava and scoriae, in 1828, it was always\r\nsurrounded by a flat pool of semi-fluid lava, into which scoriae and sand\r\nwere thrown.\r\n\r\nIn the steep simicircular escarpment of Somma, which faces the modern\r\nVesuvius, we see a great number of sheets of lava inclined at an angle\r\nof about 26 degrees. They alternate with scoriae, and are intersected\r\nby numerous dikes, which, like the sheets of lava, are composed chiefly\r\nof augite, with crystals of leucite, but the rock in the dikes is more\r\ncompact, having cooled and consolidated under greater pressure. Some of\r\nthe dikes cut through and shift others, so that they have evidently been\r\nformed during successive eruptions. While the higher region of Somma is\r\nmade up of these igneous products, there appear on its flanks, for some\r\ndepth from the surface, as seen in a ravine called the \"Fossa Grande,\"\r\nbeds of white pumiceous tuff, resembling the tuff which, at Pausilippo,\r\nand other places, near Naples, contain shells of living Mediterranean\r\nspecies. It is supposed by Pilla, Von Buch, and others, that the\r\ntufaceous beds, which rise in Somma to more than half the height of that\r\nmountain, are, in like manner, of submarine origin, because a few\r\nsea-shells have been found in them, here and there, together with\r\nserpulae of recent species attached to included blocks of\r\nlimestone.[534]\r\n\r\nIt is contended, therefore, that as these strata were once accumulated\r\nbeneath the sea, they may have been subjected as they rose to such an\r\nupward movement as may have given rise to a conical hill; and this\r\nhypothesis, it is said, acquires confirmation from the fact, that the\r\nsheets of lava near the summit of Somma are so compact and crystalline,\r\nand of such breadth individually, as would not have been the case had\r\nthey run down a steep slope. They must, therefore, have consolidated on\r\na nearly level surface, and have been subsequently uplifted into their\r\npresent inclined position.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there are no sections of sufficient depth and continuity\r\non the flanks of Somma, to reveal to us clearly the relations of the\r\nlava, scoriae, and associated dikes, forming the highest part of the\r\nmountain, with the marine tuffs observed on its declivity. Both may,\r\nperhaps, have been produced contemporaneously when Somma raised its\r\nhead, like Stromboli, above the sea, its sides and base being then\r\nsubmerged. Such a state of things may be indicated by a fact noticed by\r\nVon Buch, namely, that the pumiceous beds of Naples, when they approach\r\nSomma, contain fragments of the peculiar leucitic lava proper to that\r\nmountain, which are not found in the same tuff at a greater\r\ndistance.[535] Portions, therefore, of this lava were either thrown out\r\nby explosions, or torn off by the waves, during the deposition of the\r\npumiceous strata beneath the sea.\r\n\r\nWe have as yet but a scanty acquaintance with the laws which regulate\r\nthe flow of lava beneath water, or the arrangement of scoriae and\r\nvolcanic dust on the sides of a submarine cone. There can, however, be\r\nlittle doubt that showers of ejected matter may settle on a steep slope,\r\nand may include shells and the remains of aquatic animals, which\r\nflourish in the intervals between eruptions. Lava under the pressure of\r\nwater would be less porous; but, as Dr. Daubeny suggests, it may retain\r\nits fluidity longer than in the open air; for the rapidity with which\r\nheated bodies are cooled by being plunged into water arises chiefly from\r\nthe conversion of the lower portions of water into steam, which steam\r\nabsorbing much heat, immediately ascends, and is reconverted into water.\r\nBut under the pressure of a deep ocean, the heat of the lava would be\r\ncarried off more slowly, and only by the circulation of ascending and\r\ndescending currents of water, those portions nearest the source of heat\r\nbecoming specifically light, and consequently displacing the water\r\nabove. This kind of circulation would take place with much less rapidity\r\nthan in the atmosphere, inasmuch as the expansion of water by equal\r\nincrements of heat is less considerable than that of air.[536]\r\n\r\nWe learn from the valuable observations made by Mr. Dana on the active\r\nvolcanoes of the Sandwich Islands, that large sheets of compact basaltic\r\nlava have been poured out of craters at the top or near the summits of\r\nflattened domes higher than Etna, as in the case of Mount Loa for\r\nexample, where a copious stream two miles broad and twenty-five miles\r\nlong proceeded from an opening 13,000 feet above the level of the sea.\r\nThe usual slope of these sheets of lava is between 5 degrees. and 10\r\ndegrees.; but Mr. Dana convinced himself that, owing to the suddenness\r\nwith which they cool in the air, some lavas may occasionally form on\r\nslopes equalling 25 degrees, and still preserve a considerable\r\ncompactness of texture. It is even proved, he says, from what he saw in\r\nthe great lateral crater of Kilauea, on the flanks of Mount Loa, that a\r\nmass of such melted rock may consolidate at an inclination of 30\r\ndegrees, and be continuous for 300 or 400 feet. Such masses are narrow,\r\nhe admits, \"but if the source had been more generous, they would have\r\nhad a greater breadth, and by a succession of ejections overspreading\r\neach cooled layer, a considerable thickness might have been\r\nattained.\"[537] The same author has also shown, as before mentioned,\r\nthat in the \"cinder cones\" of the Sandwich Islands, the strata have an\r\noriginal inclination of between 35 degrees and 40 degrees.[538]\r\n\r\nMr. Scrope, writing in 1827, attributed the formation of a volcanic cone\r\nchiefly to matter ejected from a central orifice, but partly to the\r\ninjection of lava into dikes, and \"to that force of gaseous expansion,\r\nthe intensity of which, in the central parts of the cone, is attested\r\nby local earthquakes, which so often accompany eruptions.[539] It is the\r\nopinion of MM. Von Buch, De Beaumont, and Dufranoy, that the sheets of\r\nlava on Somma are so uniform and compact, that their original\r\ninclination did not exceed four or five degrees, and that four-fifths,\r\ntherefore, of their present slope is due to their having been\r\nsubsequently tilted and upraised. Notwithstanding the light thrown by M.\r\nde Beaumont on the laws regulating the flow and consolidation of lava, I\r\ndo not conceive that these laws are as yet sufficiently determined to\r\nwarrant us in assigning so much of the inclined position of the beds of\r\nSomma to the subsequent rending and dislocation of the cone. Even if\r\nthis were admitted, it is far more in harmony with the usual mode of\r\ndevelopment of volcanic forces to suppose the movement which modified\r\nthe shape of the cone to have been intermittent and gradual, and not to\r\nhave consisted of a single effort, or one sudden and violent\r\nconvulsion.[540]\r\n\r\n_Vesuvian lavas._--The lavas of Somma are characterized by containing\r\ndisseminated crystals of leucite (called, by the French, amphigene), a\r\nmineral said to be very rare in the modern lavas of Vesuvius, which are\r\nin general much more scoriaceous and less crystalline than those of\r\nSomma.[541]\r\n\r\nAt the fortress near Torre del Greco a section is exposed, fifteen feet\r\nin height, of a current which ran into the sea; and it evinces,\r\nespecially in the lower part, a decided tendency to divide into rude\r\ncolumns. A still more striking example may be seen to the west of Torre\r\ndel Annunziata, near Forte Scassato, where the mass is laid open to the\r\ndepth of twenty feet. In both these cases, however, the rock may rather\r\nbe said to be divided into numerous perpendicular fissures, than to be\r\nprismatic, although the same picturesque effect is produced. In the\r\nlava-currents of Central France (those of the Vivarais, in particular),\r\nthe uppermost portion, often forty feet or more in thickness, is an\r\namorphous mass passing downwards into lava irregularly prismatic; and\r\nunder this there is a foundation of regular and vertical columns; but\r\nthese lavas are often one hundred feet or more in thickness. We can\r\nscarcely expect to discover the same phenomenon in the shallow currents\r\nof Vesuvius, where the lowest part has cooled more rapidly, although it\r\nmay be looked for in modern streams in Iceland, which exceed even those\r\nof ancient France in volume.\r\n\r\nMr. Scrope mentions that, in the cliffs encircling the modern crater of\r\nVesuvius, he saw many currents offering a columnar division, and some\r\nalmost as regularly prismatic as any ranges of the older basalts; and he\r\nadds, that in some the spheroidal concretionary structure, on a large\r\nscale, was equally conspicuous.[542] Brieslak[543] also informs us that,\r\nin the siliceous lava of 1737, which contains augite, leucite, and\r\ncrystals of felspar, he found very regular prisms in a quarry near Torre\r\ndel Greco; an observation confirmed by modern authorities.[544]\r\n\r\n_Effects of decomposition on lavas._--The decomposition of some of the\r\nfelspathic lavas, either by simple weathering, or by gaseous emanations,\r\nconverts them from a hard to a soft clayey state, so that they no longer\r\nretain the smallest resemblance to rocks cooled down from a state of\r\nfusion. The exhalations of sulphuretted hydrogen and muriatic acid,\r\nwhich are disengaged continually from the Solfatara, also produce\r\ncurious changes on the trachyte of that nearly extinct volcano: the rock\r\nis bleached, and becomes porous, fissile, and honey-combed, till at\r\nlength it crumbles into a white siliceous powder.[545] Numerous globular\r\nconcretions, composed of concentric laminae, are also formed by the same\r\nvapors in this decomposed rock.[546]\r\n\r\n_Vesuvian minerals._--A great variety of minerals are found in the lavas\r\nof Vesuvius and Somma; augite, leucite, felspar, mica, olivine, and\r\nsulphur are most abundant. It is an extraordinary fact, that in an area\r\nof three square miles round Vesuvius, a greater number of simple\r\nminerals have been found than in any spot of the same dimensions on the\r\nsurface of the globe. Hauy enumerated only 380 species of simple\r\nminerals as known to him; and no less than eighty-two had been found on\r\nVesuvius and in the tuffs on the flanks of Somma before the end of the\r\nyear 1828.[547] Many of these are peculiar to that locality. Some\r\nmineralogists have conjectured that the greater part of these were not\r\nof Vesuvian origin, but thrown up in fragments from some older\r\nformation, through which the gaseous explosions burst. But none of the\r\nolder rocks in Italy, or elsewhere, contain such an assemblage of\r\nmineral products; and the hypothesis seems to have been prompted by a\r\ndisinclination to admit that, in times so recent in the earth's history,\r\nthe laboratory of nature could have been so prolific in the creation of\r\nnew and rare compounds. Had Vesuvius been a volcano of high antiquity,\r\nformed when nature\r\n\r\n\r\n  Wanton'd as in her prime, and play'd at will\r\n  Her virgin fancies,\r\n\r\n\r\nit would have been readily admitted that these, or a much greater\r\nvariety of substances, had been sublimed in the crevices of lava, just\r\nas several new earthy and metallic compounds are known to have been\r\nproduced by fumeroles, since the eruption of 1822.\r\n\r\n_Mass enveloping Herculaneum and Pompeii._--In addition to the ejections\r\nwhich fall on the cone, and that much greater mass which finds its way\r\ngradually to the neighboring sea, there is a third portion, often of no\r\ninconsiderable thickness, composed of alluviums, spread over the valleys\r\nand plains at small distances from the volcano. Aqueous vapors are\r\nevolved copiously from volcanic craters during eruptions, and often for\r\na long time subsequently to the discharge of scoriae and lava: these\r\nvapors are condensed in the cold atmosphere surrounding the high\r\nvolcanic peak, and heavy rains are thus caused. The floods thus\r\noccasioned, sweep along the impalpable dust and light scoriae, till a\r\ncurrent of mud is produced, which is called in Campania \"lava d' acqua,\"\r\nand is often more dreaded than an igneous stream (lava di fuoco), from\r\nthe greater velocity with which it moves. So late as the 27th of\r\nOctober, 1822, one of these alluviums descended the cone of Vesuvius,\r\nand, after overspreading much cultivated soil, flowed suddenly into the\r\nvillages of St. Sebastian and Massa, where, filling the streets and\r\ninterior of some of the houses, it suffocated seven persons. It will,\r\ntherefore, happen very frequently that, towards the base of a volcanic\r\ncone, alternations will be found of lava, alluvium, and showers of\r\nashes.\r\n\r\nTo which of these two latter divisions the mass enveloping Herculaneum\r\nand Pompeii should be referred, has been a question of the keenest\r\ncontroversy; but the discussion might have been shortened, if the\r\ncombatants had reflected that, whether volcanic sand and ashes were\r\nconveyed to the towns by running water, or through the air, during an\r\neruption, the interior of buildings, so long as the roofs remain entire,\r\ntogether with all underground vaults and cellars, could be filled only\r\nby an alluvium. We learn from history, that a heavy shower of sand,\r\npumice, and lapilli, sufficiently great to render Pompeii and\r\nHerculaneum uninhabitable, fell for eight successive days and nights in\r\nthe year 79, accompanied by violent rains.[548] We ought, therefore, to\r\nfind a very close resemblance between the strata covering these towns\r\nand those composing the minor cones of the Phlegraean Fields, accumulated\r\nrapidly, like Monte Nuovo, during a continued shower of ejected matter;\r\nwith this difference however, that the strata incumbent on the cities\r\nwould be horizontal, whereas those on the cones are highly inclined; and\r\nthat large angular fragments of rock, which are thrown out near the\r\nvent, would be wanting at a distance where small lapilli only can be\r\nfound. Accordingly, with these exceptions, no identity can be more\r\nperfect than the form, and distribution of the matter at the base of\r\nMonte Nuovo, as laid open by the encroaching sea, and the appearance of\r\nthe beds superimposed on Pompeii. That city is covered with numerous\r\nalternations of different horizontal beds of tuff and lapilli, for the\r\nmost part thin, and subdivided into very fine layers. I observed the\r\nfollowing section near the amphitheatre, in November, 1828--(descending\r\nseries):--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           Feet Inches.\r\n\r\n  1.

It will be\r\nobserved in the above section that two of the brown, half-consolidated\r\ntuffs are filled with small pisolitic globules. This circumstance is not\r\nalluded to in the animated controversy which the Royal Academy of Naples\r\nmaintained with one of their members, Signor Lippi, as to the origin of\r\nthe strata incumbent on Pompeii. The mode of aggregation of these\r\nglobules has been fully explained by Mr. Scrope, who saw them formed in\r\ngreat numbers in 1822, by rain falling during the eruption on fine\r\nvolcanic sand, and sometimes also produced like hail in the air, by the\r\nmutual attraction of the minutest particles of fine damp sand. Their\r\noccurrence, therefore, agrees remarkably well with the account of heavy\r\nrain, and showers of sand and ashes recorded in history.[550]\r\n\r\nLippi entitled his work, \"Fu il fuoco o l' acqua che sottero Pompei ed\r\nErcolano?\"[551] and he contended that neither were the two cities\r\ndestroyed in the year 79, nor by a volcanic eruption, but purely by the\r\nagency of water charged with transported matter. His letters, wherein he\r\nendeavored to dispense, as far as possible, with igneous agency, even at\r\nthe foot of the volcano, were dedicated, with great propriety, to\r\nWerner, and afford an amusing illustration of the polemic style in which\r\ngeological writers of that day indulged themselves. His arguments were\r\npartly of an historical nature, derived from the silence of contemporary\r\nhistorians, respecting the fate of the cities, which, as we have already\r\nstated, is most remarkable, and partly drawn from physical proofs. He\r\npointed out with great clearness the resemblance of the tufaceous matter\r\nin the vaults and cellars at Herculaneum and Pompeii to aqueous\r\nalluviums, and its distinctness from ejections which had fallen through\r\nthe air. Nothing, he observes, but moist pasty matter could have\r\nreceived the impression of a woman's breast, which was found in a vault\r\nat Pompeii, or have given the cast of a statue discovered in the\r\ntheatre at Herculaneum. It was objected to him, that the heat of the\r\ntuff in Herculaneum and Pompeii was proved by the carbonization of the\r\ntimber, corn, papyrus-rolls, and other vegetable substances there\r\ndiscovered; but Lippi replied with truth, that the papyri would have\r\nbeen burnt up if they had come in contact with fire, and that their\r\nbeing only carbonized was a clear demonstration of their having been\r\nenveloped, like fossil wood, in a sediment deposited from water. The\r\nAcademicians, in their report on his pamphlet, assert, that when the\r\namphitheatre was first cleared out, the matter was arranged on the steps\r\nin a succession of concave layers, accommodating themselves to the\r\ninterior form of the building, just as snow would lie if it had fallen\r\nthere. This observation is highly interesting, and points to the\r\ndifference between the stratification of ashes in an open building and\r\nof mud derived from the same in the interior of edifices and cellars.\r\nNor ought we to call the allegation in question, because it could not be\r\nsubstantiated at the time of the controversy after the matter had been\r\nall removed; although Lippi took advantage of this removal, and met the\r\nargument of his antagonists by requiring them to prove the fact. There\r\nis decisive evidence that no stream of lava has ever reached Pompeii\r\nsince it was first built, although the foundations of the town stand\r\nupon the old leucitic lava of Somma; several streams of which, with tuff\r\ninterposed, had been cut through in excavations.\r\n\r\n_Infusorial beds covering Pompeii._--A most singular and unexpected\r\ndiscovery has been recently made (1844-5) by Professor Ehrenberg,\r\nrespecting the remote origin of many of the layers of ashes and pumice\r\nenveloping Pompeii. They are, he says, in great part, of organic and\r\nfreshwater origin, consisting of the siliceous cases of microscopic\r\ninfusoria. What is still more surprising, this fact proves to be by no\r\nmeans an isolated or solitary example of an intimate relation between\r\norganic life and the results of volcanic activity. On the Rhine, several\r\nbeds of tuff and pumiceous conglomerate, resembling the mass incumbent\r\nupon Pompeii and closely connected with extinct volcanoes, are now\r\nascertained to be made up to a great extent of the siliceous cases of\r\ninfusoria (or Diatomaceae), invisible to the naked eye, and often half\r\nfused.[552] No less than 94 distinct species have already been detected\r\nin one mass of this kind, more than 150 feet thick, at Hochsimmer, on\r\nthe left bank of the Rhine, near the Laacher-see. Some of these Rhenish\r\ninfusorial accumulations appear to have fallen in showers, others to\r\nhave been poured out of lake-craters in the form of mud, as in the Brohl\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico, Peru, the Isle of France, and several other volcanic regions,\r\nanalogous phenomena have been observed, and everywhere the species of\r\ninfusoria belong to freshwater and terrestrial genera, except in the\r\ncase of the Patagonian pumiceous tuffs, specimens of which, brought\r\nhome by Mr. Darwin, are found to contain the remains of marine\r\nanimalcules. In various kinds of pumice ejected by volcanoes, the\r\nmicroscope has revealed to Professor Ehrenberg the siliceous cases of\r\ninfusoria often half obliterated by the action of heat, and the fine\r\ndust thrown out into the air during eruptions, is sometimes referable to\r\nthese most minute organic substances, brought up from considerable\r\ndepths, and sometimes mingled with small particles of vegetable matter.\r\n\r\nIn what manner did the solid coverings of these most minute plants and\r\nanimalcules, which can only originate and increase at the surface of the\r\nearth, sink down and penetrate into subterranean cavities, so as to be\r\nejected from the volcanic orifices? We have of late years become\r\nfamiliar with the fact, in the process of boring Artesian wells, that\r\nthe seeds of plants, the remains of insects, and even small fish, with\r\nother organic bodies, are carried in an uninjured state by the\r\nunderground circulation of waters, to the depth of many hundred feet.\r\nWith still greater facility in a volcanic region we may conjecture, that\r\nwater and mud full of invisible infusoria may be sucked down, from time\r\nto time, into subterranean rents and hollows in cavernous lava which has\r\nbeen permeated by gases, or in rocks dislocated by earthquakes. It often\r\nhappens that a lake which has endured for centuries in a volcanic\r\ncrater, disappears suddenly on the approach of a new eruption. Violent\r\nshocks agitate the surrounding region, and ponds, rivers, and wells are\r\ndried up. Large cavities far below may thus become filled with fen-mud\r\nchiefly composed of the more indestructible and siliceous portions of\r\ninfusoria, destined perhaps to be one day ejected in a fragmentary or\r\nhalf-fused state, yet without the obliteration of all traces of organic\r\nstructure.[553]\r\n\r\n_Herculaneum._--It was remarked that no lava has flowed over the site of\r\nPompeii, since that city was built, but with Herculaneum the case is\r\ndifferent. Although the substance which fills the interior of the houses\r\nand the vaults must have been introduced in a state of mud, like that\r\nfound in similar situations in Pompeii; yet the superincumbent mass\r\ndiffers wholly in composition and thickness. Herculaneum was situated\r\nseveral miles nearer to the volcano, and has, therefore, been always\r\nmore exposed to be covered, not only by showers of ashes, but by\r\nalluviums and streams of lava. Accordingly, masses of both have\r\naccumulated on each other above the city, to a depth of nowhere less\r\nthan 70, and in many places of 112 feet.[554]\r\n\r\nThe tuff which envelops the buildings consists of comminuted volcanic\r\nashes, mixed with pumice. A mask imbedded in this matrix has left a\r\ncast, the sharpness of which was compared by Hamilton to those in\r\nplaster of Paris; nor was the mask in the least degree scorched, as if\r\nit had been imbedded in heated matter. This tuff is porous; and, when\r\nfirst excavated, is soft and easily worked, but acquires a considerable\r\ndegree of induration on exposure to the air. Above this lowest stratum\r\nis placed, according to Hamilton, \"the matter of six eruptions,\" each\r\nseparated from the other by veins of good soil. In these soils Lippi\r\nstates that he collected a considerable number of land shells--an\r\nobservation which is no doubt correct; for many snails burrow in soft\r\nsoils, and some Italian species descend, when they hybernate, to the\r\ndepth of five feet and more from the surface. Della Torre also informs\r\nus that there is in one part of this superimposed mass a bed of true\r\nsiliceous lava (_lava di pietra dura_); and, as no such current is\r\nbelieved to have flowed till near one thousand years after the\r\ndestruction of Herculaneum, we must conclude, that the origin of a large\r\npart of the covering of Herculaneum was long subsequent to the first\r\ninhumation of the place. That city, as well as Pompeii, was a seaport.\r\nHerculaneum is still very near the shore, but a tract of land, a mile in\r\nlength, intervenes between the borders of the Bay of Naples and Pompeii.\r\nIn both cases the gain of land is due to the filling up of the bed of\r\nthe sea with volcanic matter, and not to elevation by earthquakes, for\r\nthere has been no change in the relative level of land and sea. Pompeii\r\nstood on a slight eminence composed of the lavas of the ancient\r\nVesuvius, and flights of steps led down to the water's edge. The\r\nlowermost of these steps are said to be still on an exact level with the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n_Condition and contents of the buried cities._--After these observations\r\non the nature of the strata enveloping and surrounding the cities, we\r\nmay proceed to consider their internal condition and contents, so far at\r\nleast as they offer facts of geological interest. Notwithstanding the\r\nmuch greater depth at which Herculaneum was buried, it was discovered\r\nbefore Pompeii, by the accidental circumstance of a well being sunk, in\r\n1713, which came right down upon the theatre, where the statues of\r\nHercules and Cleopatra were soon found. Whether this city or Pompeii,\r\nboth of them founded by Greek colonies, was the more considerable, is\r\nnot yet determined; but both are mentioned by ancient authors as among\r\nthe seven most flourishing cities in Campania. The walls of Pompeii were\r\nthree miles in circumference; but we have, as yet, no certain knowledge\r\nof the dimensions of Herculaneum. In the latter place the theatre alone\r\nis open for inspection; the Forum, Temple of Jupiter, and other\r\nbuildings, having been filled up with rubbish as the workmen proceeded,\r\nowing to the difficulty of removing it from so great a depth below\r\nground. Even the theatre is only seen by torch-light, and the most\r\ninteresting information, perhaps, which the geologist obtains there, is\r\nthe continual formation of stalactite in the galleries cut through the\r\ntuff; for there is a constant percolation of water charged with\r\ncarbonate of lime mixed with a small portion of magnesia. Such mineral\r\nwaters must, in the course of time, create great changes in many rocks;\r\nespecially in lavas, the pores of which they may fill with calcareous\r\nspar, so as to convert them into amygdaloids. Some geologists,\r\ntherefore, are unreasonable when they expect that volcanic rocks of\r\nremote eras should accord precisely with those of modern date; since it\r\nis obvious that many of those produced in our own time will not long\r\nretain the same aspect and internal composition.\r\n\r\nBoth at Herculaneum and Pompeii, temples have been found with\r\ninscriptions commemorating the rebuilding of the edifices after they had\r\nbeen thrown down by an earthquake.[555] This earthquake happened in the\r\nreign of Nero, sixteen years before the cities were overwhelmed. In\r\nPompeii, one-fourth of which is now laid open to the day, both the\r\npublic and private buildings bear testimony to the catastrophe. The\r\nwalls are rent, and in many places traversed by fissures still open.\r\nColumns are lying on the ground only half hewn from huge blocks of\r\ntravertin, and the temple for which they were designed is seen half\r\nrepaired. In some few places the pavement had sunk in, but in general it\r\nwas undisturbed, consisting of large irregular flags of lava joined\r\nneatly together, in which the carriage wheels have often worn ruts an\r\ninch and a half deep. In the wider streets, the ruts are numerous and\r\nirregular; in the narrower, there are only two, one on each side, which\r\nare very conspicuous. It is impossible not to look with some interest\r\neven on these ruts, which were worn by chariot wheels more than\r\nseventeen centuries ago; and, independently of their antiquity, it is\r\nremarkable to see such deep incisions so continuous in a stone of great\r\nhardness.\r\n\r\n_Small number of skeletons._--A very small number of skeletons have been\r\ndiscovered in either city; and it is clear that most of the inhabitants\r\nnot only found time to escape, but also to carry with them the principal\r\npart of their valuable effects. In the barracks at Pompeii were the\r\nskeletons of two soldiers chained to the stocks, and in the vaults of a\r\ncountry-house in the suburbs were the skeletons of seventeen persons,\r\nwho appear to have fled there to escape from the shower of ashes. They\r\nwere found inclosed in an indurated tuff, and in this matrix was\r\npreserved a perfect cast of a woman, perhaps the mistress of the house,\r\nwith an infant in her arms. Although her form was imprinted on the rock,\r\nnothing but the bones remained. To these a chain of gold was suspended,\r\nand on the fingers of the skeletons were rings with jewels. Against the\r\nsides of the same vault was ranged a long line of earthen amphorae.\r\n\r\nThe writings scribbled by the soldiers on the walls of their barracks,\r\nand the names of the owners of each house written over the doors, are\r\nstill perfectly legible. The colors of fresco paintings on the stuccoed\r\nwalls in the interior of buildings are almost as vivid as if they were\r\njust finished. There are public fountains decorated with shells laid out\r\nin patterns in the same fashion as those now seen in the town of Naples;\r\nand in the room of a painter, who was perhaps a naturalist, a large\r\ncollection of shells was found, comprising a great variety of\r\nMediterranean species, in as good a state of preservation as if they had\r\nremained for the same number of years in a museum. A comparison of these\r\nremains, with those found so generally in a fossil state would not\r\nassist us in obtaining the least insight into the time required to\r\nproduce a certain degree of decomposition or mineralization; for,\r\nalthough under favorable circumstances much greater alteration might\r\ndoubtless have been brought about in a shorter period, yet the example\r\nbefore us shows that an inhumation of seventeen centuries may sometimes\r\neffect nothing towards the reduction of shells to the state in which\r\nfossils are usually found.\r\n\r\nThe wooden beams in the houses at Herculaneum are black on the exterior,\r\nbut, when cleft open, they appear to be almost in the state of ordinary\r\nwood, and the progress made by the whole mass towards the state of\r\nlignite is scarcely appreciable. Some animal and vegetable substances of\r\nmore perishable kinds have of course suffered much change and decay, yet\r\nthe state of preservation of these is truly remarkable. Fishing-nets are\r\nvery abundant in both cities, often quite entire; and their number at\r\nPompeii is the more interesting from the sea being now, as we stated, a\r\nmile distant. Linen has been found at Herculaneum, with the texture well\r\ndefined; and in a fruiterer's shop in that city were discovered vessels\r\nfull of almonds, chestnuts, walnuts, and fruit of the \"carubiere,\" all\r\ndistinctly recognizable from their shape. A loaf, also, still retaining\r\nits form, was found in a baker's shop, with his name stamped upon it. On\r\nthe counter of an apothecary was a box of pills converted into a fine\r\nearthy substance; and by the side of it a small cylindrical roll\r\nevidently prepared to be cut into pills. By the side of these was a jar\r\ncontaining medicinal herbs. In 1827, moist olives were found in a square\r\nglass-case, and \"caviare,\" or roe of a fish, in a state of wonderful\r\npreservation. An examination of these curious condiments has been\r\npublished by Covelli of Naples, and they are preserved hermetically\r\nsealed in the museum there.[556]\r\n\r\n_Papyri._--There is a marked difference in the condition and appearance\r\nof the animal and vegetable substances found at Pompeii and Herculaneum;\r\nthose of Pompeii being penetrated by a gray pulverulent tuff, those in\r\nHerculaneum seeming to have been first enveloped by a paste which\r\nconsolidated round them, and then allowed them to become slowly\r\ncarbonized. Some of the rolls of papyrus at Pompeii still retain their\r\nform; but the writing, and indeed almost all the vegetable matter,\r\nappear to have vanished, and to have been replaced by volcanic tuff\r\nsomewhat pulverulent. At Herculaneum the earthy matter has scarcely ever\r\npenetrated; and the vegetable substance of the papyrus has become a thin\r\nfriable black matter, almost resembling in appearance the tinder which\r\nremains when stiff paper has been burnt, in which the letters may still\r\nbe sometimes traced. The small bundles of papyri, composed of five or\r\nsix rolls tied up together, had sometimes lain horizontally, and were\r\npressed in that direction, but sometimes they had been placed in a\r\nvertical position. Small tickets were attached to each bundle, on which\r\nthe title of the work was inscribed. In one case only have the sheets\r\nbeen found with writing on both sides of the pages. So numerous are the\r\nobliterations and corrections, that many must have been original\r\nmanuscripts. The variety of handwritings is quite extraordinary: nearly\r\nall are written in Greek, but there are a few in Latin. They were almost\r\nall found in a suburban villa in the library of one private individual;\r\nand the titles of four hundred of those least injured, which have been\r\nread, are found to be unimportant works, but all entirely new, chiefly\r\nrelating to music, rhetoric, and cookery. There are two volumes of\r\nEpicurus \"On Nature,\" and the others are mostly by writers of the same\r\nschool, only one fragment having been discovered, by an opponent of the\r\nEpicurean system, Chrysippus.[557]\r\n\r\n_Probability of future discoveries of MSS._--In the opinion of some\r\nantiquaries, not one-hundredth part of the city has yet been explored:\r\nand the quarters hitherto cleared out at a great expense, are those\r\nwhere there was the least probability of discovering manuscripts. As\r\nItaly could already boast her splendid Roman amphitheatres and Greek\r\ntemples, it was a matter of secondary interest to add to their number\r\nthose in the dark and dripping galleries of Herculaneum; and having so\r\nmany of the masterpieces of ancient art, we could have dispensed with\r\nthe inferior busts and statues which could alone have been expected to\r\nreward our researches in the ruins of a provincial town. But from the\r\nmoment that it was ascertained that rolls of papyrus preserved in this\r\ncity could still be deciphered, every exertion ought to have been\r\nsteadily and exclusively directed towards the discovery of other\r\nlibraries. Private dwellings should have been searched, before so much\r\nlabor and expense were consumed in examining public edifices. A small\r\nportion of that zeal and enlightened spirit which prompted the late\r\nFrench and Tuscan expedition to Egypt might long ere this, in a country\r\nnearer home, have snatched from oblivion some of the lost works of the\r\nAugustan age, or of eminent Greek historians and philosophers. A single\r\nroll of papyrus might have disclosed more matter of intense interest\r\nthan all that was ever written in hieroglyphics.\r\n\r\n_Stabiae._--Besides the cities already mentioned, Stabiae, a small town\r\nabout six miles from Vesuvius, and near the site of the modern\r\nCastel-a-Mare (see map of volcanic district of Naples), was overwhelmed\r\nduring the eruption of 79. Pliny mentions that, when his uncle was\r\nthere, he was obliged to make his escape, so great was the quantity of\r\nfalling stones and ashes. In the ruins of this place, a few skeletons\r\nhave been found buried in volcanic ejections, together with some\r\nantiquities of no great value, and rolls of papyrus, which, like those\r\nof Pompeii, were illegible.\r\n\r\n_Torre del Greco overflowed by lava._--Of the towns hitherto mentioned,\r\nHerculaneum alone has been overflowed by a stream of melted matter; but\r\nthis did not, as we have seen, enter or injure the buildings, which were\r\npreviously enveloped or covered over with tuff. But burning torrents\r\nhave often taken their course through the streets of Torre del Greco,\r\nand consumed or inclosed a large portion of the town in solid rock. It\r\nseems probable that the destruction of three thousand of its inhabitants\r\nin 1631, which some accounts attribute to boiling water, was principally\r\ndue to one of those alluvial floods which we before mentioned: but, in\r\n1737, the lava itself flowed through the eastern side of the town, and\r\nafterwards reached the sea; and, in 1794, another current, rolling over\r\nthe western side, filled the streets and houses, and killed more than\r\nfour hundred persons. The main street is now quarried through this lava,\r\nwhich supplied building stones for new houses erected where others had\r\nbeen annihilated. The church was half buried in a rocky mass, but the\r\nupper portion served as the foundation of a new edifice.\r\n\r\nThe number of the population at present is estimated at fifteen\r\nthousand; and a satisfactory answer may readily be returned to those who\r\ninquire how the inhabitants can be so \"inattentive to the voice of time\r\nand the warnings of nature,\"[558] as to rebuild their dwellings on a\r\nspot so often devastated. No neighboring site unoccupied by a town, or\r\nwhich would not be equally insecure, combines the same advantages of\r\nproximity to the capital, to the sea, and to the rich lands on the\r\nflanks of Vesuvius. If the present population were exiled, they would\r\nimmediately be replaced by another, for the same reason that the Maremma\r\nof Tuscany and the Campagna di Roma will never be depopulated, although\r\nthe malaria fever commits more havoc in a few years than the Vesuvian\r\nlavas in as many centuries. The district around Naples supplies one\r\namongst innumerable examples, that those regions where the surface is\r\nmost frequently renewed, and where the renovation is accompanied, at\r\ndifferent intervals of time, by partial destruction of animal and\r\nvegetable life, may nevertheless be amongst the most habitable and\r\ndelightful on our globe.\r\n\r\nI have already made a similar remark when speaking of tracts where\r\naqueous causes are now most active; and the observation applies as well\r\nto parts of the surface which are the abode of aquatic animals, as to\r\nthose which support terrestrial species. The sloping sides of Vesuvius\r\ngive nourishment to a vigorous and healthy population of about eighty\r\nthousand souls; and the surrounding hills and plains, together with\r\nseveral of the adjoining isles, owe the fertility of their soil to\r\nmatter ejected by prior eruptions. Had the fundamental limestone of the\r\nApennines remained uncovered throughout the whole area, the country\r\ncould not have sustained a twentieth part of its present inhabitants.\r\nThis will be apparent to every geologist who has marked the change in\r\nthe agricultural character of the soil the moment he has passed the\r\nutmost boundary of the volcanic ejections, as when, for example, at the\r\ndistance of about seven miles from Vesuvius, he leaves the plain and\r\nascends the declivity of the Sorrentine Hills.\r\n\r\nYet, favored as this region has been by Nature from time immemorial, the\r\nsigns of the changes imprinted on it during the period that it has\r\nserved as the habitation of man may appear in after-ages to indicate a\r\nseries of unparalleled disasters. Let us suppose that at some future\r\ntime the Mediterranean should form a gulf of the great ocean, and that\r\nthe waves and tidal current should encroach on the shores of Campania,\r\nas it now advances upon the eastern coast of England; the geologist will\r\nthen behold the towns already buried, and many more which will evidently\r\nbe entombed hereafter, laid open in the steep cliffs, where he will\r\ndiscover buildings superimposed above each other, with thick intervening\r\nstrata of tuff or lava--some unscathed by fire, like those of\r\nHerculaneum and Pompeii; others half melted down, as in Torre del Greco;\r\nand many shattered and thrown about in strange confusion, as in\r\nTripergola, beneath Monte Nuovo. Among the ruins will be seen skeletons\r\nof men, and impressions of the human form stamped in solid rocks of\r\ntuff. Nor will the signs of earthquakes be wanting. The pavement of part\r\nof the Domitian Way, and the temple of the Nymphs, submerged at high\r\ntide, will be uncovered at low water, the columns remaining erect and\r\nuninjured. Other temples which had once sunk down, like that of Serapis,\r\nwill be found to have been upraised again by subsequent movements. If\r\nthey who study these phenomena, and speculate on their causes, assume\r\nthat there were periods when the laws of Nature or the whole course of\r\nnatural events differed greatly from those observed in their own time,\r\nthey will scarcely hesitate to refer the wonderful monuments in question\r\nto those primeval ages. When they consider the numerous proofs of\r\nreiterated catastrophes to which the region was subject, they may,\r\nperhaps, commiserate the unhappy fate of beings condemned to inhabit a\r\nplanet during its nascent and chaotic state, and feel grateful that\r\ntheir favored race has escaped such scenes of anarchy and misrule.\r\n\r\nYet what was the real condition of Campania during those years of dire\r\nconvulsion? \"A climate where heaven's breath smells sweet and\r\nwooingly--a vigorous and luxuriant nature unparalleled in its\r\nproductions--a coast which was once the fairy-land of poets, and the\r\nfavorite retreat of great men. Even the tyrants of the creation loved\r\nthis alluring region, spared it, adorned it, lived in it, died in\r\nit.\"[559] The inhabitants, indeed, have enjoyed no immunity from the\r\ncalamities which are the lot of mankind; but the principal evils which\r\nthey have suffered must be attributed to moral, not to physical,\r\ncauses--to disastrous events over which man might have exercised a\r\ncontrol, rather than to the inevitable catastrophes which result from\r\nsubterranean agency. When Spartacus encamped his army of ten thousand\r\ngladiators in the old extinct crater of Vesuvius, the volcano was more\r\njustly a subject of terror to Campania, than it has ever been since the\r\nrekindling of its fires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nETNA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  External physiognomy of Etna--Lateral cones--Their successive\r\n    obliteration--Early eruptions--Monti Rossi in 1669--Towns overflowed\r\n    by lava--Part of Catania overflowed--Mode of advance of a current of\r\n    lava--Subterranean caverns--Marine strata at base of Etna--Val del\r\n    Bove not an ancient crater--Its scenery--Form, composition, and\r\n    origin of the dikes--Linear direction of cones formed in 1811 and\r\n    1819--Lavas and breccias--Flood produced by the melting of snow by\r\n    lava--Glacier covered by a lava stream--Val del Bove how\r\n    formed--Structure and origin of the cone of Etna--Whether the\r\n    inclined sheets of lava were originally horizontal--Antiquity of\r\n    Etna--Whether signs of diluvial waves are observable on Etna.\r\n\r\n\r\n_External physiognomy of Etna._--After Vesuvius, our most authentic\r\nrecords relate to Etna, which rises near the sea in solitary grandeur to\r\nthe height of nearly eleven thousand feet.[560] The base of the cone is\r\nalmost circular, and eighty-seven English miles in circumference; but if\r\nwe include the whole district over which its lavas extend, the circuit\r\nis probably twice that extent.\r\n\r\n_Divided into three regions._--The cone is divided by nature into three\r\ndistinct zones, called the _fertile_, the _woody_, and the _desert_\r\nregions. The first of these, comprising the delightful country around\r\nthe skirts of the mountain, is well cultivated, thickly inhabited, and\r\ncovered with olives, vines, corn, fruit-trees, and aromatic herbs.\r\nHigher up, the woody region encircles the mountain--an extensive forest\r\nsix or seven miles in width, affording pasturage for numerous flocks.\r\nThe trees are of various species, the chestnut, oak, and pine being most\r\nluxuriant; while in some tracts are groves of cork and beech. Above the\r\nforest is the desert region, a waste of black lava and scoriae; where, on\r\na kind of plain, rises a cone of eruption to the height of about eleven\r\nhundred feet, from which sulphureous vapors are continually evolved.\r\n\r\n_Cones produced by lateral eruption._--The most grand and original\r\nfeature in the physiognomy of Etna is the multitude of minor cones which\r\nare distributed over its flanks, and which are most abundant in the\r\nwoody region. These, although they appear but trifling irregularities\r\nwhen viewed from a distance as subordinate parts of so imposing and\r\ncolossal a mountain, would, nevertheless, be deemed hills of\r\nconsiderable altitude in almost any other region. Without enumerating\r\nnumerous monticules of ashes thrown out at different points, there are\r\nabout eighty of these secondary volcanoes, of considerable dimensions;\r\nfifty-two on the west and north, and twenty-seven on the east side of\r\nEtna. One of the largest, called Monte Minardo, near Bronte, is upwards\r\nof 700 feet in height, and a double hill near Nicolosi, called Monti\r\nRossi, formed in 1669, is 450 feet high, and the base two miles in\r\ncircumference; so that it somewhat exceeds in size Monte Nuovo, before\r\ndescribed. Yet it ranks only as a cone of the second magnitude amongst\r\nthose produced by the lateral eruptions of Etna. On looking down from\r\nthe lower borders of the desert region, these volcanoes present us with\r\none of the most delightful and characteristic scenes in Europe. They\r\nafford every variety of height and size, and are arranged in beautiful\r\nand picturesque groups. However uniform they may appear when seen from\r\nthe sea, or the plains below, nothing can be more diversified than their\r\nshape when we look from above into their craters, one side of which is\r\ngenerally broken down. There are, indeed, few objects in nature more\r\npicturesque than a wooded volcanic crater. The cones situated in the\r\nhigher parts of the forest zone are chiefly clothed with lofty pines;\r\nwhile those at a lower elevation are adorned with chestnuts, oaks,\r\nbeech, and holm.\r\n\r\n_Successive obliteration of these cones._--The history of the eruptions\r\nof Etna, imperfect and interrupted as it is, affords us, nevertheless,\r\nmuch insight into the manner in which the whole mountain has\r\nsuccessively attained its present magnitude and internal structure. The\r\nprincipal cone has more than once fallen in and been reproduced. In 1444\r\nit was 320 feet high, and fell in after the earthquakes of 1537. In the\r\nyear 1693, when a violent earthquake shook the whole of Sicily, and\r\nkilled sixty thousand persons, the cone lost so much of its height, says\r\nBoccone, that it could not be seen from several places in Valdemone,\r\nfrom which it was before visible. The greater number of eruptions happen\r\neither from the great crater, or from lateral openings in the desert\r\nregion. When hills are thrown up in the middle zone, and project beyond\r\nthe general level, they gradually lose their height during subsequent\r\neruptions; for when lava runs down from the upper parts of the mountain,\r\nand encounters any of these hills, the stream is divided, and flows\r\nround them so as to elevate the gently sloping grounds from which they\r\nrise. In this manner a deduction is often made at once of twenty or\r\nthirty feet, or even more, from their height. Thus, one of the minor\r\ncones, called Monte Peluso, was diminished in altitude by a great lava\r\nstream which encircled it in 1444; and another current has recently\r\ntaken the same course--yet this hill still remains four or five hundred\r\nfeet high.\r\n\r\nThere is a cone called Monte Nucilla near Nicolosi, round the base of\r\nwhich several successive currents have flowed, and showers of ashes have\r\nfallen, since the time of history, till at last, during an eruption in\r\n1536, the surrounding plain was so raised, that the top of the cone\r\nalone was left projecting above the general level. Monte Nero, situated\r\nabove the Grotta dell' Capre, was in 1766 almost submerged by a current:\r\nand Monte Capreolo afforded, in the year 1669, a curious example of one\r\nof the last stages of obliteration; for a lava stream, descending on a\r\nhigh ridge which had been built up by the continued superposition of\r\nsuccessive lavas, flowed directly into the crater, and nearly filled it.\r\nThe lava, therefore, of each new lateral cone tends to detract from the\r\nrelative height of lower cones above their base: so that the flanks of\r\nEtna, sloping with a gentle inclination, envelop in succession a great\r\nmultitude of minor volcanoes, while new ones spring up from time to\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n_Early eruptions of Etna._--Etna appears to have been in activity from\r\nthe earliest times of tradition; for Diodorus Siculus mentions an\r\neruption which caused a district to be deserted by the Sicani before the\r\nTrojan war. Thucydides informs us, that in the sixth year of the\r\nPeloponnesian war, or in the spring of the year 425 B. C., a lava stream\r\nravaged the environs of Catania, and this he says was the third eruption\r\nwhich had happened in Sicily since the colonization of that island by\r\nthe Greeks.[561] The second of the three eruptions alluded to by the\r\nhistorian took place in the year 475 B. C., and was that so poetically\r\ndescribed by Pindar, two years afterwards, in his first Pythian ode:--\r\n\r\n              [Greek: kion\r\n  D' ourania synechei\r\n  Niphoess' Aitna, panetes\r\n  Chionos oxeias tithena.]\r\n\r\nIn these and the seven verses which follow, a graphic description is\r\ngiven of Etna, such as it appeared five centuries before the Christian\r\nera, and such as it has been seen when in eruption in modern times. The\r\npoet is only making a passing allusion to the Sicilian volcano, as the\r\nmountain under which Typhoeus lay buried, yet by a few touches of his\r\nmaster-hand every striking feature of the scene has been faithfully\r\nportrayed. We are told of \"the snowy Etna, the pillar of heaven--the\r\nnurse of everlasting frost, in whose deep caverns lie concealed the\r\nfountains of unapproachable fire--a stream of eddying smoke by day--a\r\nbright and ruddy flame by night; and burning rocks rolled down with loud\r\nuproar into the sea.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.\r\n\r\nMinor cones on the flanks of Etna.\r\n\r\n1. Monti Rossi, near Nicolosi, formed in 1669. 2. Vampeluso?[562]]\r\n\r\n_Eruption of 1669--Monti Rossi formed._--The great eruption which\r\nhappened in the year 1669 is the first which claims particular\r\nattention. An earthquake had levelled to the ground all the houses in\r\nNicolosi, a town situated near the lower margin of the woody region,\r\nabout twenty miles from the summit of Etna, and ten from the sea at\r\nCatania. Two gulfs then opened near that town, from whence sand and\r\nscoriae were thrown up in such quantity, that in the course of three or\r\nfour months a double cone was formed, called Monti Rossi, about 450 feet\r\nhigh. But the most extraordinary phenomenon occurred at the commencement\r\nof the convulsion in the plain of S. Lio. A fissure six feet broad, and\r\nof unknown depth, opened with a loud crash, and ran in a somewhat\r\ntortuous course to within a mile of the summit of Etna. Its direction\r\nwas from north to south, and its length twelve miles. It emitted a most\r\nvivid light. Five other parallel fissures of considerable length\r\nafterwards opened, one after the other, and emitted smoke, and gave out\r\nbellowing sounds which were heard at the distance of forty miles. This\r\ncase seems to present the geologist with an illustration of the manner\r\nin which those continuous dikes of vertical porphyry were formed, which\r\nare seen to traverse some of the older lavas of Etna; for the light\r\nemitted from the great rent of S. Lio appears to indicate that the\r\nfissure was filled to a certain height with incandescent lava, probably\r\nto the height of an orifice not far distant from Monti Rossi, which at\r\nthat time opened and poured out a lava current. When the melted matter\r\nin such a rent has cooled, it must become a solid wall or dike,\r\nintersecting the older rocks of which the mountain is composed; similar\r\nrents have been observed during subsequent eruptions, as in 1832, when\r\nthey ran in all directions from the centre of the volcano. It has been\r\njustly remarked by M. Elie de Beaumont, that such star-shaped fractures\r\nmay indicate a slight upheaval of the whole of Etna. They may be the\r\nsigns of the stretching of the mass, which may thus be raised gradually\r\nby a force from below.[563]\r\n\r\nThe lava current of 1669, before alluded to, soon reached in its course\r\na minor cone called Mompiliere, at the base of which it entered a\r\nsubterranean grotto, communicating with a suite of those caverns which\r\nare so common in the lavas of Etna. Here it appears to have melted down\r\nsome of the vaulted foundations of the hill, so that the whole of that\r\ncone became slightly depressed and traversed by numerous open fissures.\r\n\r\n_Part of Catania destroyed._--The lava, after overflowing fourteen towns\r\nand villages, some having a population of between three and four\r\nthousand inhabitants, arrived at length at the walls of Catania. These\r\nhad been purposely raised to protect the city; but the burning flood\r\naccumulated till it rose to the top of the rampart, which was sixty feet\r\nin height, and then it fell in a fiery cascade and overwhelmed part of\r\nthe city. The wall, however, was not thrown down, but was discovered\r\nlong afterwards by excavations made in the rock by the Prince of\r\nBiscari; so that the traveller may now see the solid lava curling over\r\nthe top of the rampart as if still in the very act of falling.\r\n\r\nThis great current performed the first thirteen miles of its course in\r\ntwenty days, or at the rate of 162 feet per hour, but required\r\ntwenty-three days for the last two miles, giving a velocity of only\r\ntwenty-two feet per hour; and we learn from Dolomieu that the stream\r\nmoved during part of its course at the rate of 1500 feet an hour, and in\r\nothers it took several days to cover a few yards.[564] When it entered\r\nthe sea it was still six hundred yards broad, and forty feet deep. It\r\ncovered some territories in the environs of Catania which had never\r\nbefore been visited by the lavas of Etna. While moving on, its surface\r\nwas in general a mass of solid rock; and its mode of advancing, as is\r\nusual with lava streams, was by the occasional fissuring of the solid\r\nwalls. A gentleman of Catania, named Pappalardo, desiring to secure the\r\ncity from the approach of the threatening torrent, went out with a party\r\nof fifty men whom he had dressed in skins to protect them from the heat,\r\nand armed with iron crows and hooks. They broke open one of the solid\r\nwalls which flanked the current near Belpasso, and immediately forth\r\nissued a rivulet of melted matter which took the direction of Paterno;\r\nbut the inhabitants of that town, being alarmed for their safety, took\r\nup arms and put a stop to farther operations.[565]\r\n\r\nAs another illustration of the solidity of the walls of an advancing\r\nlava stream, I may mention an adventure related by Recupero, who, in\r\n1766, had ascended a small hill formed of ancient volcanic matter, to\r\nbehold the slow and gradual approach of a fiery current, two miles and a\r\nhalf broad; when suddenly two small threads of liquid matter issuing\r\nfrom a crevice detached themselves from the main stream, and ran rapidly\r\ntowards the hill. He and his guide had just time to escape, when they\r\nsaw the hill, which was fifty feet in height, surrounded, and in a\r\nquarter of an hour melted down into the burning mass, so as to flow on\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be supposed that this complete fusion of rocky matter\r\ncoming in contact with lava is of universal, or even common, occurrence.\r\nIt probably happens when fresh portions of incandescent matter come\r\nsuccessively in contact with fusible materials. In many of the dikes\r\nwhich intersect the tuffs and lavas of Etna, there is scarcely any\r\nperceptible alteration effected by heat on the edges of the horizontal\r\nbeds, in contact with the vertical and more crystalline mass. On the\r\nside of Mompiliere, one of the towns overflowed in the great eruption\r\nabove described, an excavation was made in 1704; and by immense labor\r\nthe workmen reached, at the depth of thirty-five feet, the gate of the\r\nprincipal church, where there were three statues, held in high\r\nveneration. One of these, together with a bell, some money, and other\r\narticles, were extracted in a good state of preservation from beneath a\r\ngreat arch formed by the lava. It seems very extraordinary that any\r\nworks of art, not encased with tuff, like those in Herculaneum, should\r\nhave escaped fusion in hollow spaces left open in this lava-current,\r\nwhich was so hot at Catania eight years after it entered the town, that\r\nit was impossible to hold the hand in some of the crevices.\r\n\r\n_Subterranean caverns on Etna._--Mention was made of the entrance of a\r\nlava-stream into a subterranean grotto, whereby the foundations of a\r\nhill were partially undermined. Such underground passages are among the\r\nmost curious features on Etna, and appear to have been produced by the\r\nhardening of the lava, during the escape of great volumes of elastic\r\nfluids, which are often discharged for many days in succession, after\r\nthe crisis of the eruption is over. Near Nicolosi, not far from Monti\r\nRossi, one of these great openings may be seen, called the Fossa della\r\nPalomba, 625 feet in circumference at its mouth, and seventy-eight deep.\r\nAfter reaching the bottom of this, we enter another dark cavity, and\r\nthen others in succession, sometimes descending precipices by means of\r\nladders. At length the vaults terminate in a great gallery ninety feet\r\nlong, and from fifteen to fifty broad, beyond which there is still a\r\npassage, never yet explored; so that the extent of these caverns remains\r\nunknown.[566] The walls and roofs of these great vaults are composed of\r\nrough and bristling scoriae, of the most fantastic forms.\r\n\r\n_Marine strata at base of Etna._--If we skirt the fertile region at the\r\nbase of Etna on its southern and eastern sides, we behold marine strata\r\nof clay sand, and volcanic tuff, cropping out from beneath the modern\r\nlavas. The marine fossil shells occurring in these strata are all of\r\nthem, or nearly all, identical with species now inhabiting the\r\nMediterranean; and as they appear at the height of from 600 to 800 feet\r\nabove the sea near Catania, they clearly prove that there has been in\r\nthis region, as in other parts of Sicily farther to the south, an upward\r\nmovement of the ancient bed of the sea. It is fair, therefore, to infer\r\nthat the whole mountain, with the exception of those parts which are of\r\nvery modern origin, has participated in this upheaval.\r\n\r\nIf we view Etna from the south, we see the marine deposits above alluded\r\nto, forming a low line of hills (_e_, _e_, Fig. 47), or a steep inland\r\nslope or cliff (_f_), as in the annexed drawing taken from the limestone\r\nplatform of Primosole. It should be observed however, in reference to\r\nthis view, that the height of the volcanic cone is ten times greater\r\nthan the hills at its base (_e_, _e_), although it appears less\r\nelevated, because the summit of the cone is ten or twelve times more\r\ndistant from the plain of Catania than is Licodia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.\r\n\r\nView of Etna from the summit of the limestone platform of Primosole.\r\n\r\n_a_, Highest cone.\r\n\r\n_b_, Montagnuola.\r\n\r\n_c_, Monte Minardo, with smaller lateral cones above.\r\n\r\n_d_, Town of Licodia dei Monaci.\r\n\r\n_e_, Marine formation called creta, argillaceous and sandy beds with a\r\nfew shells, and associated volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\n_f_, Escarpment of stratified subaqueous volcanic tuff, &c., northwest\r\nof Catania.\r\n\r\n_g_, Town of Catania.\r\n\r\n_h i_, Dotted line expressing the highest boundary along which the\r\nmarine strata are occasionally seen.\r\n\r\n_k_, Plain of Catania.\r\n\r\n_l_, Limestone platform of Primosole of the Newer Pliocene period.\r\n\r\n_m_, La Motta di Catania.]\r\n\r\nThe mountain is in general of a very symmetrical form, a flattened cone\r\nbroken on its eastern side, by a deep valley, called the Val del Bove,\r\nor in the provincial dialect of the peasants, \"Val di Bua,\" for here the\r\nherdsman\r\n\r\n\r\n    ---- \"in reducta valle mugientium\r\n  Prospectat errantes greges.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Buckland was, I believe, the first English geologist who examined\r\nthis valley with attention, and I am indebted to him for having\r\ndescribed it to me, before I visited Sicily, as more worthy of attention\r\nthan any single spot in that island, or perhaps in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III\r\n\r\nVIEW LOOKING UP THE VAL DEL BOVE, ETNA]\r\n\r\nThe Val del Bove commences near the summit of Etna, and descending\r\ninto the woody region, is farther continued on one side by a second and\r\nnarrower valley, called the Val di Calanna. Below this another, named\r\nthe Val di St. Giacomo, begins,--a long narrow ravine, which is\r\nprolonged to the neighborhood of Zaffarana (_e_, fig. 48), on the\r\nconfines of the fertile region. These natural incisions into the side of\r\nthe volcano are of such depth that they expose to view a great part of\r\nthe structure of the entire mass, which, in the Val del Bove, is laid\r\nopen to the depth of from 3000 to above 4000 feet from the summit of\r\nEtna. The geologist thus enjoys an opportunity of ascertaining how far\r\nthe internal conformation of the cone corresponds with what he might\r\nhave anticipated as the result of that mode of increase which has been\r\nwitnessed during the historical era.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.\r\n\r\nGreat valley on the east side of Etna.\r\n\r\n_a_, Highest cone.\r\n\r\n_b_, Montagnuola.\r\n\r\n_c_, Head of Val del Bove.\r\n\r\n_d_, _d_, Serre del Solfizio.\r\n\r\n_e_, Village of Zaffarana on the lower border of the woody region.\r\n\r\n_f_, One of the lateral cones.\r\n\r\n_g_, Monti Rossi.]\r\n\r\n_Description of Plate III._--The accompanying view (Pl. III.) is part of\r\na panoramic sketch which I made in November, 1828, and may assist the\r\nreader in comprehending some topographical details to be alluded to in\r\nthe sequel, although it can convey no idea of the picturesque grandeur\r\nof the scene.\r\n\r\nThe great lava-currents of 1819 and 1811 are seen pouring down from the\r\nhigher parts of the valley, overrunning the forests of the great plain,\r\nand rising up in the foreground on the left with a rugged surface, on\r\nwhich many hillocks and depressions appear, such as often characterize a\r\nlava-current immediately after its consolidation.\r\n\r\nThe small cone, No. 7, was formed in 1811, and was still smoking when I\r\nsaw it in 1828. The other small volcano to the left, from which vapor is\r\nissuing, was, I believe, one of those formed in 1819.\r\n\r\nThe following are the names of some of the other points indicated in the\r\nsketch:--\r\n\r\n   1, Montagnuola.\r\n   2, Torre del Filosofo.\r\n   3, Highest cone.\r\n   4, Lepra.\r\n   5, Finocchio.\r\n   6, Capra.\r\n   7, Cone of 1811.\r\n   8, Cima del Asino.\r\n   9, Musara.\r\n  10, Zocolaro.\r\n  11, Rocca di Calanna.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATE IV.--The second view (Pl. IV.) represents the same\r\nvalley as seen from above, or looking directly down the Val del Bove,\r\nfrom the summit of the principal crater formed in 1819.[567] I am\r\nunable to point out the precise spot which this crater would occupy in\r\nthe view represented in Plate III.; but I conceive that it would appear\r\nin the face of the great precipice, near which the smoke issuing from\r\nthe cone No. 7 is made to terminate. There are many ledges of rock on\r\nthe face of that precipice where eruptions have occurred.\r\n\r\nThe circular form of the Val del Bove is well shown in this view. (Pl.\r\nIV.) To the right and left are the lofty precipices which form the\r\nsouthern and northern sides of the great valley, and which are\r\nintersected by dikes projecting in the manner afterwards to be\r\ndescribed. In the distance appears the \"fertile region\" of Etna,\r\nextending like a great plain along the sea-coast.\r\n\r\nThe spots particularly referred to in the plate are the following:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  _a_, Cape Spartivento, in Italy, of which the outline is seen\r\n         in the distance.\r\n\r\n  _b_, The promontory of Taormino, on the Sicilian coast.\r\n\r\n  _c_, The river Alcantra.\r\n\r\n  _d_, The small village of Riposto.\r\n\r\n  _f_, The town of Aci Reale.\r\n\r\n  _g_, Cyclopian islands, or \"Faraglioni,\" in the Bay of Trezza.\r\n\r\n  _h_, The great harbor of Syracuse.\r\n\r\n  _k_, The Lake of Lentini.\r\n\r\n  _i_, The city of Catania, near which is marked the course of\r\n         the lava which flowed from the Monti Rossi in 1669,\r\n         and destroyed part of the city.\r\n\r\n  _l_, To the left of the view is the crater of 1811, which is\r\n         also shown at No. 7 in Plate III.\r\n\r\n  _m_, Rock of Musara, also seen at No. 9 in Plate III.\r\n\r\n  _e_, Valley of Calanna.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Val del Bove is of truly magnificent dimensions, a vast amphitheatre\r\nfour or five miles in diameter, surrounded by nearly vertical\r\nprecipices, varying from 1000 to above 3000 feet in height, the loftiest\r\nbeing at the upper end, and the height gradually diminishing on both\r\nsides. The feature which first strikes the geologist as distinguishing\r\nthe boundary cliffs of this valley, is the prodigious multitude of\r\nverticle dikes which are seen in all directions traversing the volcanic\r\nbeds. The circular form of this great chasm, and the occurrence of these\r\ncountless dikes, amounting perhaps to several thousands in number, so\r\nforcibly recalled to my mind the phenomena of the Atrio del Cavallo, on\r\nVesuvius, that I at first imagined that I had entered a vast crater, on\r\na scale as far exceeding that of Somma, as Etna surpasses Vesuvius in\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nBut I was soon undeceived when I had attentively explored the different\r\nsides of the great amphitheatre, in order to satisfy myself whether the\r\nsemicircular wall of the Val del Bove had ever formed the boundary of a\r\ncrater, and whether the beds had the same quaqua-versal dip which is so\r\nbeautifully exhibited in the escarpment of Somma. Had the supposed\r\nanalogy between Somma and the Val del Bove held true, the tufts and\r\nlavas at the head of the valley would have dipped to the west, those on\r\nthe north side towards the north, and those on the southern side to the\r\nsouth. But such I did not find to be the inclination of the beds; they\r\nall dip towards the sea, or nearly east, as in the valleys of St.\r\nGiacomo and Calanna below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV\r\n\r\nVIEW OF THE VAL DEL BOVE, ETNA, AS SEEN FROM ABOVE, OR FROM THE CRATER\r\nOF 1819]\r\n\r\n_Scenery of the Val del Bove._--Let the reader picture to himself a\r\nlarge amphitheatre, five miles in diameter, and surrounded on three\r\nsides by precipices from 2000 to 3000 feet in height. If he has beheld\r\nthat most picturesque scene in the chain of the Pyrenees, the celebrated\r\n\"cirque of Gavarnie,\" he may form some conception of the magnificent\r\ncircle of precipitous rocks which inclose, on three sides, the great\r\nplain of the Val del Bove. This plain has been deluged by repeated\r\nstreams of lava; and although it appears almost level, when viewed from\r\na distance, it is, in fact, more uneven than the surface of the most\r\ntempestuous sea. Besides the minor irregularities of the lava, the\r\nvalley is in one part interrupted by a ridge of rocks, two of which,\r\nMusara and Capra, are very prominent. It can hardly be said that they\r\n\r\n\r\n      ----\"like giants stand\r\n  To sentinel enchanted land;\"\r\n\r\n\r\nfor although, like the Trosachs, in the Highlands of Scotland, they are\r\nof gigantic dimensions, and appear almost isolated, as seen from many\r\npoints, yet the stern and severe grandeur of the scenery which they\r\nadorn is not such as would be selected by a poet for a vale of\r\nenchantment. The character of the scene would accord far better with\r\nMilton's picture of the infernal world; and if we imagine ourselves to\r\nbehold in motion, in the darkness of the night, one of those fiery\r\ncurrents which have so often traversed the great valley, we may well\r\nrecall\r\n\r\n\r\n  ----\"yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild,\r\n  The seat of desolation, void of light,\r\n  Save what the glimmering of these livid flames\r\n  Casts pale and dreadful.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe face of the precipices already mentioned is broken in the most\r\npicturesque manner by the vertical walls of lava which traverse them.\r\nThese masses visually stand out in relief, are exceedingly diversified\r\nin form, and of immense altitude. In the autumn, their black outline may\r\noften be seen relieved by clouds of fleecy vapor which settle behind\r\nthem, and do not disperse until mid-day, continuing to fill the valley\r\nwhile the sun is shining on every other part of Sicily, and on the\r\nhigher regions of Etna.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the vapors begin to rise, the changes of scene are varied in\r\nthe highest degree, different rocks being unveiled and hidden by turns,\r\nand the summit of Etna often breaking through the clouds for a moment\r\nwith its dazzling snows, and being then as suddenly withdrawn from the\r\nview.\r\n\r\nAn unusual silence prevails; for there are no torrents dashing from the\r\nrocks, nor any movement of running water in this valley such as may\r\nalmost invariably be heard in mountainous regions. Every drop of water\r\nthat falls from the heavens, or flows from the melting ice and snow, is\r\ninstantly absorbed by the porous lava; and such is the dearth of\r\nsprings, that the herdsman is compelled to supply his flocks, during\r\nthe hot season, from stores of snow laid up in hollows of the mountain\r\nduring winter.\r\n\r\nThe strips of green herbage and forest land, which have here and there\r\nescaped the burning lavas, serve, by contrast, to heighten the\r\ndesolation of the scene. When I visited the valley, nine years after the\r\neruption of 1819, I saw hundreds of trees, or rather the white skeletons\r\nof trees, on the borders of the black lava, the trunks and branches\r\nbeing all leafless, and deprived of their bark by the scorching heat\r\nemitted from the melted rock; an image recalling those beautiful\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  ----\"As when heaven's fire\r\n  Hath scath'd the forest oaks, or mountain pines,\r\n  With singed top their stately growth, though bare,\r\n  Stands on the blasted heath.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.\r\n\r\nDikes at the base of the Serre del Solfizio, Etna.]\r\n\r\n_Form, composition, and origin of the dikes._--But without indulging the\r\nimagination any longer in descriptions of scenery, I may observe that\r\nthe dikes before mentioned form unquestionably the most interesting\r\ngeological phenomenon in the Val del Bove. Some of these are composed of\r\ntrachyte, others of compact blue basalt with olivine. They vary in\r\nbreadth from two to twenty feet and upwards, and usually project from\r\nthe face of the cliffs, as represented in the annexed drawing (fig. 49).\r\nThey consist of harder materials than the strata which they traverse,\r\nand therefore waste away less rapidly under the influence of that\r\nrepeated congelation and thawing to which the rocks in this zone of\r\nEtna are exposed. The dikes are for the most part vertical, but\r\nsometimes they run in a tortuous course through the tuffs and breccias,\r\nas represented in fig. 50. In the escarpment of Somma, where similar\r\nwalls of lava cut through alternating beds of sand and scoriae, a coating\r\nof coal-black rock, approaching in its nature and appearance to\r\npitchstone, is seen at the contact of the dike with the intersected\r\nbeds. I did not observe such parting layers at the junction of the\r\nEtnean dikes which I examined, but they may perhaps be discoverable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.\r\n\r\nTortuous veins of lava at Punto di Giumento, Etna.]\r\n\r\nThe geographical position of these dikes is most interesting, as they\r\nare very numerous near the head of the Val del Bove, where the cones of\r\n1811 and 1819 were thrown up, as also in that zone of the mountain where\r\nlateral eruptions are frequent; whereas in the valley of Calanna, which\r\nis below that parallel, and in a region where lateral eruptions are\r\nextremely rare, scarcely any dikes are seen, and none whatever still\r\nlower in the valley of St. Giacomo. This is precisely what we might have\r\nexpected, if we consider the vertical fissures now filled with rock to\r\nhave been the feeders of lateral cones, or, in other words, the channels\r\nwhich gave passage to the lava-currents and scoriae that have issued from\r\nvents in the forest zone. In other parts of Etna there may be numerous\r\ndikes at as low a level as the Valley of Calanna, because the line of\r\nlateral eruptions is not everywhere at the same height above the sea;\r\nbut in the section above alluded to, there appeared to me an obvious\r\nconnection between the frequency of dikes and of lateral eruptions.\r\n\r\nSome fissures may have been filled from above, but I did not see any\r\nwhich, by terminating downwards, gave proof of such an origin. Almost\r\nall the isolated masses in the Val del Bove, such as Capra, Musara, and\r\nothers, are traversed by dikes, and may, perhaps, have partly owed their\r\npreservation to that circumstance, if at least the action of occasional\r\nfloods has been one of the destroying causes in the Val del Bove; for\r\nthere is nothing which affords so much protection to a mass of strata\r\nagainst the undermining action of running water as a perpendicular dike\r\nof hard rock.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying drawing (fig. 51), the flowing of the lavas of 1811\r\nand 1819, between the rocks Finochio, Capra, and Musara, is represented.\r\nThe height of the two last-mentioned isolated masses has been much\r\ndiminished by the elevation of their base, caused by these currents.\r\nThey may, perhaps, be the remnants of lateral cones which existed before\r\nthe Val del Bove was formed, and may hereafter be once more buried by\r\nthe lavas that are now accumulating in the valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.\r\n\r\nView of the rocks Finochio, Capra, and Musara, Val del Bove.]\r\n\r\nFrom no point of view are the dikes more conspicuous than from the\r\nsummit of the highest cone of Etna; a view of some of them is given in\r\nthe annexed drawing. (Fig. 52.)\r\n\r\n_Eruption of 1811._--I have alluded to the streams of lava which were\r\npoured forth in 1811 and 1819. Gemmellaro, who witnessed these\r\neruptions, informs us that the great crater in 1811 first testified by\r\nits loud detonations that a column of lava had ascended to near the\r\nsummit of the mountain. A violent shock was then felt, and a stream\r\nbroke out from the side of the cone, at no great distance from its apex.\r\nShortly after this had ceased to flow, a second stream burst forth at\r\nanother opening, considerably below the first; then a third still lower,\r\nand so on till seven different issues had been thus successively formed,\r\nall lying upon the same straight line. It has been supposed that this\r\nline was a perpendicular rent in the internal framework of the mountain,\r\nwhich rent was probably not produced at one shock, but prolonged\r\nsuccessively downwards, by the lateral pressure and intense heat of the\r\ninternal column of lava, as it subsided by gradual discharge through\r\neach vent.[568]\r\n\r\n_Eruption of 1819._--In 1819 three large mouths or caverns opened very\r\nnear those which were formed in the eruptions of 1811, from which\r\nflames, red-hot cinders, and sand were thrown up with loud explosions. A\r\nfew minutes afterwards another mouth opened below, from which flames\r\nand smoke issued; and finally a fifth, lower still, whence a torrent of\r\nlava flowed, which spread itself with great velocity over the deep and\r\nbroad valley called \"Val del Bove.\" This stream flowed two miles in the\r\nfirst twenty-four hours, and nearly as far in the succeeding day and\r\nnight. The three original mouths at length united into one large crater,\r\nand sent forth lava, as did the inferior apertures, so that an enormous\r\ntorrent poured down the \"Val del Bove.\" When it arrived at a vast and\r\nalmost perpendicular precipice, at the head of the Valley of Calanna, it\r\npoured over in a cascade, and, being hardened in its descent, made an\r\ninconceivable crash as it was dashed against the bottom. So immense was\r\nthe column of dust raised by the abrasion of the tufaceous hill over\r\nwhich the hardened mass descended, that the Catanians were in great\r\nalarm, supposing a new eruption to have burst out in the woody region,\r\nexceeding in violence that near the summit of Etna.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.\r\n\r\nView from the summit of Etna into the Val del Bove.[569]]\r\n\r\n_Mode of advance of the lava._--Of the cones thrown up during this\r\neruption, not more than two are of sufficient magnitude to be numbered\r\namong those eighty which were before described as adorning the flanks of\r\nEtna. The surface of the lava which deluged the \"Val del Bove,\" consists\r\nof rocky and _angular blocks_, tossed together in the utmost disorder.\r\nNothing can be more rugged, or more unlike the smooth and even\r\nsuperficies, which those who are unacquainted with volcanic countries\r\nmay have pictured to themselves, in a mass of matter which had\r\nconsolidated from a liquid state. Mr. Scrope observed this current in\r\nthe year 1819, slowly advancing down a considerable slope, at the rate\r\nof about a yard an hour, nine months after its emission. The lower\r\nstratum being arrested by the resistance of the ground, the upper or\r\ncentral part gradually protruded itself, and, being unsupported, fell\r\ndown. This in its turn was covered by a mass of more liquid lava, which\r\nswelled over it from above. The current had all the appearance of a huge\r\nheap of rough and large cinders rolling over and over upon itself by the\r\neffect of an extremely slow propulsion from behind. The contraction of\r\nthe crust as it solidified, and the friction of the scoriform cakes\r\nagainst one another, produced a crackling sound. Within the crevices a\r\ndull red heat might be seen by night, and vapor issuing in considerable\r\nquantity was visible by day.[570]\r\n\r\nIt was stated that when the lava of 1819 arrived at the head of the\r\nValley of Calanna, after flowing down the Val del Bove, it descended in\r\na cascade. This stream, in fact, like many previous currents of lava\r\nwhich have flowed down successively from the higher regions of Etna, was\r\nturned by a great promontory projecting from the southern side of the\r\nVal del Bove. This promontory consists of the hills called Zocolaro and\r\nCalanna, and of a ridge of inferior height which connects them. (See\r\nfig. 53.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A, Zocolaro.\r\n  B, Monte di Calanna.\r\n  C, Plain at the head of the Valley of Calanna.\r\n _a_, Lava of 1819 descending the precipice and flowing through\r\n         the valley.\r\n _b_, Lavas of 1811 and 1819 flowing round the hill of Calanna.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened in 1811 and 1819 that the flows of lava overtopped the ridge\r\nintervening between the hills of Zocolaro and Calanna, so that they fell\r\nin a cascade over a lofty precipice, and began to fill up the valley of\r\nCalanna (_a_, fig. 53). Other portions of the same lava-current (_b_)\r\nflowed round the promontory, and they exhibit one of the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of such streams, namely that of becoming solid\r\nexternally, even while yet in motion. Instead of thinning out gradually\r\nat their edges, their sides may often be compared to two rocky walls\r\nwhich are sometimes inclined at an angle of between thirty and forty\r\ndegrees. When such streams are turned from their course by a projecting\r\nrock, they move right onwards in a new direction; and in the Valley of\r\nCalanna a considerable space has thus been left between the steep sides\r\nof the lavas _b b_, so deflected, and the precipitous escarpment of\r\nZocolaro, A, which bounds the plain C.\r\n\r\n_Lavas and breccias._--In regard to the volcanic masses which are\r\nintersected by dikes in the Val del Bove, they consist in great part of\r\ngraystone lavas, of an intermediate character between basalt and\r\ntrachyte, and partly of porphyritic lava resembling trachyte, but to\r\nwhich that name cannot, according to Von Buch and G. Rose, be in\r\nstrictness applied, because the felspar belongs to the variety called\r\nLabradorite. There is great similarity in the composition of the ancient\r\nand modern lavas of Etna, both consisting of felspar, augite, olivine,\r\nand titaniferous iron. The alternating breccias are made up of scoriae,\r\nsand, and angular blocks of lava. Many of these fragments may have been\r\nthrown out by volcanic explosions, which, falling on the hardened\r\nsurface of moving lava-currents, may have been carried to a considerable\r\ndistance. It may also happen that when lava advances very slowly, in the\r\nmanner of the flow of 1819, the angular masses resulting from the\r\nfrequent breaking of the mass as it rolls over upon itself, may produce\r\nthese breccias. It is at least certain that the upper portion of the\r\nlava-currents of 1811 and 1819 now consist of angular masses to the\r\ndepth of many yards. D'Aubuisson has compared the surface of one of the\r\nancient lavas of Auvergne to that of a river suddenly frozen over by the\r\nstoppage of immense fragments of drift-ice, a description perfectly\r\napplicable to these modern Etnean flows. The thickness of the separate\r\nbeds of conglomerate or breccia which are seen in the same vertical\r\nsection, is often extremely different, varying from 3 to nearly 50 feet,\r\nas I observed in the hill of Calanna.\r\n\r\n_Flood produced by the melting of snow by lava._--It is possible that\r\nsome of the breccias or conglomerates may be referred to aqueous causes,\r\nas great floods occasionally sweep down the flanks of Etna, when\r\neruptions take place in winter, and when the snows are melted by lava.\r\nIt is true that running water in general exerts no power on Etna, the\r\nrain which falls being immediately imbibed by the porous lavas; so that,\r\nvast as is the extent of the mountain, it feeds only a few small\r\nrivulets, and these, even, are dry throughout the greater portion of the\r\nyear. The enormous rounded boulders, therefore, of felspar-porphyry and\r\nbasalt, a line of which can be traced from the sea, from near Giardini,\r\nby Mascali, and Zafarana, to the \"Val del Bove,\" would offer a\r\nperplexing problem to the geologist, if history had not preserved the\r\nmemorials of a tremendous flood which happened in this district in the\r\nyear 1755. It appears that two streams of lava flowed in that year, on\r\nthe 2d of March, from the highest crater; they were immediately\r\nprecipitated upon an enormous mass of snow which then covered the whole\r\nmountain, and was extremely deep near the summit. The sudden melting of\r\nthis frozen mass, by a fiery torrent three miles in length, produced a\r\nfrightful inundation, which devastated the sides of the mountain for\r\neight miles in length, and afterwards covered the lower flanks of Etna,\r\nwhere they were less steep, together with the plains near the sea, with\r\ngreat deposits of sand, scoriae, and blocks of lava.\r\n\r\nMany absurd stories circulated in Sicily respecting this event; such as\r\nthat the water was boiling, and that it was vomited from the highest\r\ncrater; that it was as salt as the sea, and full of marine shells; but\r\nthese were mere inventions, to which Recupero, although he relates them\r\nas tales of the mountaineers, seems to have attached rather too much\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nFloods of considerable violence have also been produced on Etna by the\r\nfall of heavy rains, aided, probably, by the melting of snow. By this\r\ncause alone, in 1761, sixty of the inhabitants of Acicatena were killed,\r\nand many of their houses swept away.[571]\r\n\r\n_Glacier covered by a lava-stream._--A remarkable discovery was made on\r\nEtna in 1828 of a great mass of ice, preserved for many years, perhaps\r\nfor centuries, from melting, by the singular accident of a current of\r\nred-hot lava having flowed over it. The following are the facts in\r\nattestation of a phenomenon which must at first sight appear of so\r\nparadoxical a character. The extraordinary heat experienced in the South\r\nof Europe, during the summer and autumn of 1828, caused the supplies of\r\nsnow and ice which had been preserved in the spring of that year, for\r\nthe use of Catania and the adjoining parts of Sicily and the island of\r\nMalta, to fail entirely. Great distress was consequently felt for want\r\nof a commodity regarded in those countries as one of the necessaries of\r\nlife rather than an article of luxury, and the abundance of which\r\ncontributes in some of the larger cities to the salubrity of the water\r\nand the general health of the community. The magistrates of Catania\r\napplied to Signor M. Gemmellaro, in the hope that his local knowledge of\r\nEtna might enable him to point out some crevice or natural grotto on the\r\nmountain, where drift-snow was still preserved. Nor were they\r\ndisappointed; for he had long suspected that a small mass of perennial\r\nice at the foot of the highest cone was part of a large and continuous\r\nglacier covered by a lava-current. Having procured a large body of\r\nworkmen, he quarried into this ice, and proved the superposition of the\r\nlava for several hundred yards, so as completely to satisfy himself that\r\nnothing but the subsequent flowing of the lava over the ice could\r\naccount for the position of the glacier. Unfortunately for the\r\ngeologist, the ice was so extremely hard, and the excavation so\r\nexpensive, that there is no probability of the operations being renewed.\r\n\r\nOn the first of December, 1828, I visited this spot, which is on the\r\nsoutheast side of the cone, and not far above the Casa Inglese; but the\r\nfresh snow had already nearly filled up the new opening, so that it had\r\nonly the appearance of the mouth of a grotto. I do not, however,\r\nquestion the accuracy of the conclusion of Signer Gemmellaro, who, being\r\nwell acquainted with all the appearances of drift-snow in the fissures\r\nand cavities of Etna, had recognized, even before the late excavations,\r\nthe peculiarity of the position of the ice in this locality. We may\r\nsuppose that, at the commencement of the eruption, a deep mass of\r\ndrift-snow had been covered by volcanic sand showered down upon it\r\nbefore the descent of the lava. A dense stratum of this fine dust mixed\r\nwith scoriae is well known to be an extremely bad conductor of heat; and\r\nthe shepherds in the higher regions of Etna are accustomed to provide\r\nwater for their flocks during summer, by strewing a layer of volcanic\r\nsand a few inches thick over the snow, which effectually prevents the\r\nheat of the sun from penetrating.\r\n\r\nSuppose the mass of snow to have been preserved from liquefaction until\r\nthe lower part of the lava had consolidated, we may then readily\r\nconceive that a glacier thus protected, at the height of ten thousand\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, would endure as long as the snows of\r\nMont Blanc, unless melted by volcanic heat from below. When I visited\r\nthe great crater in the beginning of winter (December 1st, 1828), I\r\nfound the crevices in the interior incrusted with thick ice, and in some\r\ncases hot vapors were actually streaming out between masses of ice and\r\nthe rugged and steep walls of the crater.[572]\r\n\r\nAfter the discovery of Signor Gemmellaro, it would not be surprising to\r\nfind in the cones of the Icelandic volcanoes, which are covered for the\r\nmost part with perpetual snow, repeated alternations of lava-streams and\r\nglaciers. We have, indeed, Lieutenant Kendall's authority for the fact\r\nthat Deception Island, in New South Shetland, lat. 62 degrees. 55\r\nminutes S., is principally composed of alternate layers of volcanic\r\nashes and ice.[573]\r\n\r\n_Origin of the Val del Bove._--It is recorded, as will be stated in the\r\nhistory of earthquakes (ch. 29), that in the year 1772 a great\r\nsubsidence took place on Papandayang, the largest volcano in the island\r\nof Java; an extent of ground _fifteen miles in length_, _and six in\r\nbreadth_, covered by no less than forty villages, was engulphed, and the\r\ncone lost 4000 feet of its height. In like manner the summit of\r\nCarguairazo, one of the loftiest of the Andes of Quito, fell in on the\r\n19th July, 1698; and another mountain of still greater altitude in the\r\nsame chain, called Capac Urcu, a short time before the conquest of\r\nAmerica by the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nIt will also be seen in the next chapter that, so late as the year\r\n1822, during a violent earthquake and volcanic eruption in Java, one\r\nside of the mountain called Galongoon, which was covered by a dense\r\nforest, became an enormous gulf in the form of a semicircle. The new\r\ncavity was about midway between the summit and the plain, and surrounded\r\nby steep rocks.\r\n\r\nNow we might imagine a similar event, or a series of subsidences to have\r\nformerly occurred on the eastern side of Etna, although such\r\ncatastrophes have not been witnessed in modern times, or only on a very\r\ntrifling scale. A narrow ravine, about a mile long, twenty feet wide,\r\nand from twenty to thirty-six in depth, has been formed, within the\r\nhistorical era, on the flanks of the volcano, near the town of\r\nMascalucia; and a small circular tract, called the Cisterna, near the\r\nsummit, sank down in the year 1792, to the depth of about forty feet,\r\nand left on all sides of the chasm a vertical section of the beds,\r\nexactly resembling those which are seen in the precipices of the Val del\r\nBove. At some remote periods, therefore, we might suppose more extensive\r\nportions of the mountain to have fallen in during great earthquakes.\r\n\r\nBut we ought not to exclude entirely from our speculations another\r\npossible agency, by which the great cavity may in part at least have\r\nbeen excavated, namely, the denuding action of the sea. Whether its\r\nwaves may once have had access to the great valley before the ancient\r\nportion of Etna was upheaved to its present elevation, is a question\r\nwhich will naturally present itself to every geologist. Marine shells\r\nhave been traced to a height of 800 feet above the base of Etna, and\r\nwould doubtless be seen to ascend much higher, were not the structure of\r\nthe lower region of the mountain concealed by floods of lava. We cannot\r\nascertain to what extent a change in the relative level of land and sea\r\nmay have been carried in this spot, but we know that some of the\r\ntertiary strata in Sicily of no ancient date reach a height of 3000\r\nfeet, and the marine deposits on the flanks of Etna, full of recent\r\nspecies of shells, may ascend to equal or greater heights. The narrow\r\nValley of Calanna leading out of the Val del Bove, and that of San\r\nGiacomo lower down, have much the appearance of ravines swept out by\r\naqueous action.\r\n\r\n_Structure and origin of the cone of Etna._--Our data for framing a\r\ncorrect theory of the manner in which the cone of Etna has acquired its\r\npresent dimensions and internal structure are very imperfect, because it\r\nis on its eastern side only, in the Val del Bove above described, that\r\nwe see a deep section exposed. Even here we obtain no insight into the\r\ninterior composition of the mountain beyond a depth of between three and\r\nfour thousand feet below the base of that highest cone, which has been\r\nseveral times destroyed and renewed. The precipices seen at the head of\r\nthe Val del Bove, in the escarpment called the Serre del Solfizio,\r\nexhibit merely the same series of alternating lavas and breccias, which,\r\ndescending with a general dip towards the sea, form the boundary cliffs\r\nof all other parts of the Val del Bove. If then we estimate the height\r\nof Etna at about 11,000 feet, we may say that we know from actual\r\nobservation less than one-half of its component materials, assuming it\r\nto extend downwards to the level of the sea; namely, first, the highest\r\ncone, which is about 1000 feet above its base; and, secondly, the\r\nalternations of lava, tuff, and volcanic breccia, which constitute the\r\nrocks between the Cisterna, near the base of the upper cone, and the\r\nfoot of the precipices at the head of the Val del Bove. At the lowest\r\npoint to which the vertical section extends, there are no signs of any\r\napproach to a termination of the purely volcanic mass, which may perhaps\r\npenetrate many thousand feet farther downwards. There is, indeed, a rock\r\ncalled Rocca Gianicola, near the foot of the great escarpment, which\r\nconsists of a large mass between 150 and 200 feet wide, not divided into\r\nbeds, and almost resembling granite in its structure, although agreeing\r\nvery closely in mineral composition with the lavas of Etna in\r\ngeneral.[574] This mass may doubtless be taken as a representative of\r\nthose crystalline or plutonic formations which would be met with in\r\nabundance if we could descend to greater depths in the direction of the\r\ncentral axis of the mountain. For a great body of geological evidence\r\nleads us to conclude, that rocks of this class result from the\r\nconsolidation, under great pressure, of melted matter, which has risen\r\nup and filled rents and chasms, such, for example, as may communicate\r\nwith the principal and minor vents of eruption in a volcano like Etna.\r\n\r\nBut, if we speculate on the nature of the formation which the lava may\r\nhave pierced in its way upwards, we may fairly presume that a portion of\r\nthese consist of marine tertiary rocks, like those of the neighboring\r\nVal di Noto, or those which skirt the borders of the Etnean cone, on its\r\nsouthern and eastern sides. Etna may, in fact, have been at first an\r\ninsular volcano, raising its summit but slightly above the level of the\r\nsea; but we have no grounds for concluding that any of the beds exposed\r\nin the deep section of the Val del Bove have formed a part of such a\r\nmarine accumulation. On the contrary, all the usual signs of subaqueous\r\norigin are wanting; and even if we believe the foundations of the\r\nmountain to have been laid in the sea, we could not expect this portion\r\nto be made visible in sections which only proceed downwards from the\r\nsummit through one-half the thickness of the mountain, especially as the\r\nhighest points attained by the tertiary strata in other parts of Sicily\r\nvery rarely exceed 3000 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern and southern base of Etna, a marine deposit, already\r\nalluded to, is traced up to the height of 800 or 1000 feet, before it\r\nbecomes concealed beneath that covering of modern lavas which is\r\ncontinually extending its limits during successive eruptions, and\r\nprevents us from ascertaining how much higher the marine strata may\r\nascend. As the imbedded shells belong almost entirely to species now\r\ninhabiting the Mediterranean, it is evident that there has been here an\r\nupheaval of the region at the base of Etna at a very modern period. It\r\nis fair, therefore, to infer that the volcanic nucleus of the mountain,\r\npartly perhaps of submarine, and partly of subaerial origin,\r\nparticipated in this movement, and was carried up bodily. Now, in\r\nproportion as a cone gains height by such a movement, combined with the\r\ncumulative effects of eruptions, throwing out matter successively from\r\none or more central vents, the hydrostatic pressure of the columns of\r\nlava augments with their increasing height, until the time arrives when\r\nthe flanks of the cone can no longer resist the increased pressure; and\r\nfrom that period they give way more readily, lateral outbursts becoming\r\nmore frequent. Hence, independently of any local expansion of the\r\nfractured volcanic mass, those general causes by which the modern\r\ntertiary strata of a great part of Sicily have been raised to the height\r\nof several thousand feet above their original level, would tend\r\nnaturally to render the discharge of lava and scoriae from the summit of\r\nEtna less copious, and the lateral discharge greater.\r\n\r\nIf, then, a conical or dome-shaped mass of volcanic materials was\r\naccumulated to the height of 4000, or perhaps 7000 feet, before the\r\nupward movement began, or, what is much more probable, during the\r\ncontinuance of the upward movement, that ancient mass would not be\r\nburied under the products of newer eruptions, because these last would\r\nthen be poured out chiefly at a lower level.\r\n\r\nSince I visited Etna in 1828, M. de Beaumont has published a most\r\nvaluable memoir on the structure and origin of that mountain, which he\r\nexamined in 1834;[575] and an excellent description of it has also\r\nappeared in the posthumous work of Hoffmann.[576]\r\n\r\nIn M. de Beaumont's essay, in which he has explained his views with\r\nuncommon perspicuity and talent, he maintains that all the alternating\r\nstony and fragmentary beds, more than 3000 feet thick, which are exposed\r\nin the Val del Bove, were formed originally on a surface so nearly flat\r\nthat the slope never exceeded three degrees. From this horizontal\r\nposition they were at length heaved up suddenly (d'un seul coup) into a\r\ngreat mountain, to which no important additions have since been made.\r\nPrior to this upthrow, a platform is supposed to have existed above the\r\nlevel of the sea, in which various fissures opened; and from these\r\nmelted matter was poured forth again and again, which spread itself\r\naround in thin sheets of uniform thickness. From the same rents issued\r\nshowers of scoriae and fragmentary matter, which were spread out so as to\r\nform equally uniform and horizontal beds, intervening between the sheets\r\nof lava. But although, by the continued repetition of these operations,\r\na vast pile of volcanic matter, 4000 feet or more in thickness, was\r\nbuilt up precisely in that region where Etna now rises, and to which\r\nnothing similar was produced elsewhere in Sicily, still we are told that\r\nEtna was not yet a mountain. No hypothetical diagram has been given to\r\nhelp us to conceive how this great mass of materials of supramarine\r\norigin could have been disposed of in horizontal beds, so as not to\r\nconstitute an eminence towering far above the rest of Sicily; but it is\r\nassumed that a powerful force from below at length burst suddenly\r\nthrough the horizontal formation, uplifted it to a considerable height,\r\nand caused the beds to be, in many places, highly inclined. This\r\nelevatory force was not all expended on a single central point as Von\r\nBuch has imagined in the case of Palma, Teneriffe, or Somma, but rather\r\nfollowed for a short distance a linear direction.[577]\r\n\r\nAmong other objections that may be advanced against the theory above\r\nproposed, I may mention, first, that the increasing number of dikes as\r\nwe approach the head of the Val del Bove, or the middle of Etna, and the\r\ngreat thickness of lava, scoriae, and conglomerates in that region, imply\r\nthat the great centre of eruption was always where it now is, or nearly\r\nat the same point, and there must, therefore, have been a tendency, from\r\nthe beginning, to a conical or dome-shaped arrangement in the ejected\r\nmaterials. Secondly, were we to admit a great number of separate points\r\nof eruption, scattered over a plain or platform, there must have been a\r\ngreat number of cones thrown up over these different vents; and these\r\nhills, some of which would probably be as lofty as those now seen on the\r\nflanks of Etna, or from 300 to 750 feet in height, would break the\r\ncontinuity of the sheets of lava, while they would become gradually\r\nenveloped by them. The ejected materials, moreover, would slope at a\r\nhigh angle on the sides of these cones, and where they fell on the\r\nsurrounding plain, would form strata thicker near the base of each cone\r\nthan at a distance.\r\n\r\nWhat then are the facts, it will be asked, to account for which this\r\nhypothesis of original horizontality, followed by a single and sudden\r\neffort of upheaval, which gave to the beds their present slope, has been\r\ninvented? M. de Beaumont observes, that in the boundary precipices of\r\nthe Val del Bove, sheets of lava and intercalated beds of cinders, mixed\r\nwith pulverulent and fragmentary matter evidently cast out during\r\neruptions, are sometimes inclined at steep angles, varying from 15\r\ndegrees. to 27 degrees. It is impossible, he says, that the lavas could\r\nhave flowed originally on planes so steeply inclined, for streams which\r\ndescend a slope even of 10 degrees form narrow stripes, and never\r\nacquire such a compact texture. Their thickness, moreover, always\r\ninconsiderable, varies with every variation of steepness, in the\r\ndeclivity down which they flow; whereas, in several parts of the Val del\r\nBove, the sheets of lava are continuous for great distances, in spite of\r\ntheir steep inclination, and are often compact, and perfectly parallel\r\none to the other, even where there are more than 100 beds of\r\ninterpolated fragmentary matter.\r\n\r\nThe intersecting dikes also terminate upwards in many instances, at\r\ndifferent elevations, and blend (or, as M. de Beaumont terms it,\r\narticulate) with sheets of lava, which they meet at right angles. It is\r\ntherefore assumed that such dikes were the feeders of the streams of\r\nlava with which they unite, and they are supposed to prove that the\r\nplatform, on the surface of which the melted matter was poured out, was\r\nat first so flat, that the fluid mass spread freely and equally in every\r\ndirection, and not towards one point only of the compass, as would\r\nhappen if it had descended the sloping sides of a cone. This argument is\r\ningeniously and plainly put in the following terms:--\"Had the melted\r\nmatter poured down an inclined plane, after issuing from a rent, the\r\nsheet of lava would, after consolidation, have formed an elbow with the\r\ndike, like the upper bar of the letter F, instead of extending itself on\r\nboth sides like that of a T.\"[578] It is also contended that a series of\r\nsheets of lava, formed on a conical or dome-shaped mountain, would have\r\nbeen more numerous at points farthest from the central axis, since every\r\ndike which had been the source of a lava-stream, must have poured its\r\ncontents downwards, and never upwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.\r\n\r\nDikes as they would now appear had they been originally perpendicular.]\r\n\r\nIn reference to the facts here stated, I may mention that the dikes\r\nwhich I saw in the Val del Bove were either vertical, or made almost all\r\nof them a near approach to the perpendicular, which could not have been\r\nthe case had they been the feeders of horizontal beds of lava, and had\r\nthey consequently joined them originally at right angles, for then the\r\ndikes, as at _a_, _b_, _c_, fig. 54, ought subsequently to have acquired\r\na considerable slope, like the beds which they intersect. I may also\r\nurge another objection to the views above set forth, namely, that had\r\nthe dikes been linear vents, or orifices of eruption, we must suppose\r\nthe inter-stratified scoriae and lapilli, as well as the lavas, to have\r\ncome out of them, and in that case the irregular heaping up of\r\nfragmentary matter around the vents would, as before hinted, have\r\ndisturbed that uniform thickness and parallelism of the beds which M. de\r\nBeaumont describes.\r\n\r\nIf, however, some of the sheets of lava join the dikes in such a manner,\r\nas to imply that they were in a melted state simultaneously with the\r\ncontents of the fissures,--a point not easily ascertained, where the\r\nprecipices are for the most part inaccessible,--the fact may admit of a\r\ndifferent interpretation from that proposed by the French geologists.\r\nRents like those before alluded to (p. 399), which opened in the plain\r\nof S. Lio in 1669, filled below with incandescent lava, may have lain in\r\nthe way of currents of melted matter descending from higher openings. In\r\nthat case, the matter of the current would have flowed into the fissure\r\nand mixed with the lava at its bottom. Numerous open rents of this kind\r\nare described by Mr. Dana as having been caused, during a late eruption,\r\nin one of the volcanic domes of the Sandwich Islands. They remained open\r\nat various heights on the slopes of the great cone, running in different\r\ndirections, and demonstrate the possibility of future junctions of\r\nslightly inclined lava-streams with perpendicular walls of lava.\r\n\r\nTo me, therefore, it appears far more easy to explain the uniform\r\nthickness and parallelism of so many lavas and beds of fragmentary\r\nmatter seen in the Val del Bove, by supposing them to have issued\r\nsuccessively out of one or more higher vents near the summit of a great\r\ndome, than to imagine them to have proceeded from lateral dikes or rents\r\nopening in a level plain. In the Sandwich Islands, we have examples of\r\nvolcanic domes 15,000 feet high, produced by successive outpourings from\r\nvents at or near the summit. One of these, Mount Loa, has a slope in all\r\ndirections of 6 degrees 30 minutes; another, Mount Kea, a mean\r\ninclination of 7 degrees 46 minutes. That their lavas may occasionally\r\nconsolidate on slopes of 25 degrees, and even more, and still preserve\r\nconsiderable solidity of texture, has been already stated; see above, p.\r\n383.\r\n\r\nWe know not how large a quantity of modern lava may have been poured\r\ninto the bottom of the Val del Bove, yet we perceive that eruptions\r\nbreaking forth near the centre of Etna have already made some progress\r\nin filling up this great hollow. Even within the memory of persons now\r\nliving, the rocks of Musara and Capra have, as before stated, lost much\r\nof their height and picturesque grandeur by the piling up of recent\r\nlavas round their base (see fig. 51, p. 408), and the great chasm has\r\nintercepted many streams which would otherwise have deluged the fertile\r\nregion below, as has happened on the side of Catania. The volcanic\r\nforces are now laboring, therefore, to repair the breach which\r\nsubsidence has caused on one side of the great cone; and unless their\r\nenergy should decline, or a new sinking take place, they may in time\r\nefface this inequality. In that event, the restored portion will always\r\nbe unconformable to the more ancient part, yet it will consist, like it,\r\nof alternating beds of lava, scoriae;, and conglomerates, which, with all\r\ntheir irregularities, will have a general slope from the centre and\r\nsummit of Etna towards the sea.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude, then, by remarking that I conceive the general\r\ninclination of the alternating stony and fragmentary beds of the Val del\r\nBove, from the axis of Etna towards its circumference or base, and the\r\ngreater thickness of the volcanic pile as we approach the central parts\r\nof the mountain, to be due to the preponderance of eruptions from that\r\ncentre. These gave rise, from the first, to a dome-shaped mass, which\r\nhas ever since been increasing in height and area, being fractured again\r\nand again by the expansive force of vapors, and the several parts made\r\nto cohere together more firmly after the solidification of the lava with\r\nwhich every open fissure and chasm has been filled. At the same time the\r\ncone may have gained a portion of its height by the elevatory effect of\r\nsuch dislocating movements, and the sheets of lava may have acquired in\r\nsome places a greater, in others a less, inclination than that which at\r\nfirst belonged to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.\r\n\r\nNon-volcanic protuberance and valley of elevation.]\r\n\r\nBut had the mountain been due solely, or even principally, to upheaval,\r\nits structure would have resembled that which geologists have so often\r\nrecognized in dome-shaped hills, or certain elevated regions, which all\r\nconsider as having been thrust up by a force from below. In this case\r\nthere is often an elliptical cavity at the summit, due partly to the\r\nfracture of the upraised rocks, but still more to aqueous denudation, as\r\nthey rose out of the sea. The central cavity, or valley, exposes to view\r\nthe subjacent formation _c_, fig. 55, and the incumbent mass dips away\r\non all sides from the axis, but has no tendency to thin out near the\r\nbase of the dome, or at _x_, _x_; whereas at this point the volcanic\r\nmass terminates (see fig. 56) and allows the fundamental rock _c_ to\r\nappear at the surface. In the last diagram, the more ordinary case is\r\nrepresented of a great hollow or crater at the summit of the volcanic\r\ncone; but instead of this, we have seen that in the case of Etna there\r\nis a deep lateral depression, called the Val del Bove, the upper part of\r\nwhich approaches near to the central axis, and the origin of which we\r\nhave attributed to subsidence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.\r\n\r\nVolcanic mountain and crater.]\r\n\r\n_Antiquity of the cone of Etna._--It was before remarked that confined\r\nnotions in regard to the quantity of past time have tended, more than\r\nany other prepossessions, to retard the progress of sound theoretical\r\nviews in geology;[579] the inadequacy of our conceptions of the earth's\r\nantiquity having cramped the freedom of our speculations in this\r\nscience, very much in the same way as a belief in the existence of a\r\nvaulted firmament once retarded the progress of astronomy. It was not\r\nuntil Descartes assumed the indefinite extent of the celestial spaces,\r\nand removed the supposed boundaries of the universe, that just opinions\r\nbegan to be entertained of the relative distances of the heavenly\r\nbodies; and until we habituate ourselves to contemplate the possibility\r\nof an indefinite lapse of ages having been comprised within each of the\r\nmodern periods of the earth's history, we shall be in danger of forming\r\nmost erroneous and partial views in geology.\r\n\r\nIf history had bequeathed to us a faithful record of the eruptions of\r\nEtna, and a hundred other of the principal active volcanoes of the\r\nglobe, during the last three thousand years,--if we had an exact account\r\nof the volume of lava and matter ejected during that period, and the\r\ntimes of their production,--we might, perhaps, be able to form a correct\r\nestimate of the average rate of the growth of a volcanic cone. For we\r\nmight obtain a mean result from the comparison of the eruptions of so\r\ngreat a number of vents, however irregular might be the development of\r\nthe igneous action in any one of them, if contemplated singly during a\r\nbrief period.\r\n\r\nIt would be necessary to balance protracted periods of inaction against\r\nthe occasional outburst of paroxysmal explosions. Sometimes we should\r\nhave evidence of a repose of seventeen centuries, like that which was\r\ninterposed in Ischia, between the end of the fourth century B.C., and\r\nthe beginning of the fourteenth century of our era.[580] Occasionally a\r\ntremendous eruption, like that of Jorullo, would be recorded, giving\r\nrise, at once, to a considerable mountain.\r\n\r\nIf we desire to approximate to the age of a cone such as Etna, we ought\r\nfirst to obtain some data in regard to the thickness of matter which has\r\nbeen added during the historical era, and then endeavor to estimate the\r\ntime required for the accumulation of such alternating lavas and beds of\r\nsand and scoriae as are superimposed upon each other in the Val del Bove;\r\nafterwards we should try to deduce, from observations on other\r\nvolcanoes, the more or less rapid increase of burning mountains in all\r\nthe different stages of their growth.\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable analogy between the mode of increase of a\r\nvolcanic cone and that of trees of _exogenous_ growth. These trees\r\naugment, both in height and diameter, by the successive application\r\nexternally of cone upon cone of new ligneous matter; so that if we make\r\na transverse section near the base of the trunk, we intersect a much\r\ngreater number of layers than nearer to the summit. When branches\r\noccasionally shoot out from the trunk, they first pierce the bark, and\r\nthen, after growing to a certain size, if they chance to be broken off,\r\nthey may become inclosed in the body of the tree, as it augments in\r\nsize, forming knots in the wood, which are themselves composed of layers\r\nof ligneous matter, cone within cone.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, a volcanic mountain, as we have seen, consists of a\r\nsuccession of conical masses enveloping others, while lateral cones,\r\nhaving a similar internal structure, often project, in the first\r\ninstance, like branches from the surface of the main cone, and then\r\nbecoming buried again, are hidden like the knots of a tree.\r\n\r\nWe can ascertain the age of an oak or pine by counting the number of\r\nconcentric rings of annual growth seen in a transverse section near the\r\nbase, so that we may know the date at which the seedling began to\r\nvegetate. The Baobab-tree of Senegal (_Adansonia digitata_) is supposed\r\nto exceed almost any other in longevity. Adanson inferred that one which\r\nhe measured, and found to be thirty feet in diameter, had attained the\r\nage of 5150 years. Having made an incision to a certain depth, he first\r\ncounted three hundred rings of annual growth, and observed what\r\nthickness the tree had gained in that period. The average rate of growth\r\nof younger trees, of the same species, was then ascertained, and the\r\ncalculation made according to a supposed mean rate of increase. De\r\nCandolle considers it not improbable that the celebrated Taxodium of\r\nChapultepec, in Mexico (_Cupressus disticha_, Linn.), which is 117 feet\r\nin circumference, may be still more aged.[581]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, impossible, until more data are collected respecting the\r\naverage intensity of the volcanic action, to make any thing like an\r\napproximation to the age of a cone like Etna; because, in this case, the\r\nsuccessive envelopes of lava and scoriae are not continuous, like the\r\nlayers of wood in a tree, and afford us no definite measure of time.\r\nEach conical envelope is made up of a great number of distinct\r\nlava-currents and showers of sand and scoriae, differing in quantity, and\r\nwhich may have been accumulated in unequal periods of time. Yet we\r\ncannot fail to form the most exalted conception of the antiquity of this\r\nmountain, when we consider that its base is about ninety miles in\r\ncircumference; so that it would require ninety flows of lava, each a\r\nmile in breadth at their termination, to raise the present foot of the\r\nvolcano as much as the average height of one lava-current.\r\n\r\nThere are no records within the historical era which lead to the opinion\r\nthat the altitude of Etna has materially varied within the last two\r\nthousand years. Of the eighty most conspicuous minor cones which adorn\r\nits flanks, only one of the largest, Monti Rossi, has been produced\r\nwithin the times of authentic history. Even this hill, thrown up in the\r\nyear 1669, although 450 feet in height, only ranks as a cone of second\r\nmagnitude. Monte Minardo, near Bronte, rises, even now, to the height of\r\n750 feet, although its base has been elevated by more modern lavas and\r\nejections. The dimensions of these larger cones appear to bear testimony\r\nto _paroxysms_ of volcanic activity, after which we may conclude, from\r\nanalogy, that the fires of Etna remained dormant for many years--since\r\nnearly a century of rest has sometimes followed a violent eruption in\r\nthe historical era. It must also be remembered, that of the small number\r\nof eruptions which occur in a century, one only is estimated to issue\r\nfrom the summit of Etna for every two that proceed from the sides. Nor\r\ndo all the lateral eruptions give rise to such cones as would be\r\nreckoned amongst the smallest of the eighty hills above enumerated; some\r\nof them produce merely insignificant monticules, which are soon\r\nafterwards buried by showers of ashes.\r\n\r\nHow many years then must we not suppose to have been expended in the\r\nformation of the eighty cones? It is difficult to imagine that a fourth\r\npart of them have originated during the last thirty centuries. But if we\r\nconjecture the whole of them to have been formed in twelve thousand\r\nyears, how inconsiderable an era would this portion of time constitute\r\nin the history of the volcano! If we could strip off from Etna all the\r\nlateral monticules now visible, together with the lavas and scoriae that\r\nhave been poured out from them, and from the highest crater, during the\r\nperiod of their growth, the diminution of the entire mass would be\r\nextremely slight: Etna might lose, perhaps, several miles in diameter at\r\nits base, and some hundreds of feet in elevation; but it would still be\r\nthe loftiest of Sicilian mountains, studded with other cones, which\r\nwould be recalled, as it were, into existence by the removal of the\r\nrocks under which they are now buried.\r\n\r\nThere seems nothing in the deep sections of the Val del Bove to indicate\r\nthat the lava-currents of remote periods were greater in volume than\r\nthose of modern times; and there are abundant proofs that the countless\r\nbeds of solid rock and scoriae were accumulated, as now, in succession.\r\nOn the grounds, therefore, already explained, we must infer that a mass\r\nso many thousand feet in thickness must have required an immense series\r\nof ages anterior to our historical periods for its growth; yet the whole\r\nmust be regarded as the product of a modern portion of the tertiary\r\nepoch. Such, at least, is the conclusion that seems to follow from\r\ngeological data, which show that the oldest parts of the mountain, if\r\nnot of posterior date to the marine strata around its base, were at\r\nleast of coeval origin.\r\n\r\nSome geologists contend, that the sudden elevation of large continents\r\nfrom beneath the waters of the sea have again and again produced waves\r\nwhich have swept over vast regions of the earth.[582] But it is clear\r\nthat no devastating wave has passed over the forest zone of Etna since\r\nany of the lateral cones before mentioned were thrown up; for none of\r\nthese heaps of loose sand and scoriae could have resisted for a moment\r\nthe denuding action of a violent flood. To some, perhaps, it may appear\r\nthat hills of such incoherent materials cannot be of very great\r\nantiquity, because the mere action of the atmosphere must, in the course\r\nof several thousand years, have obliterated their original forms. But\r\nthere is no weight in this objection; for the older hills are covered\r\nwith trees and herbage, which protect them from waste; and, in regard to\r\nthe newer ones, such is the porosity of their component materials, that\r\nthe rain which falls upon them is instantly absorbed; and for the same\r\nreason that the rivers on Etna have a subterranean course, there are\r\nnone descending the sides of the minor cones.\r\n\r\nNo sensible alteration has been observed in the form of these cones\r\nsince the earliest periods of which there are memorials; and there seems\r\nno reason for anticipating that in the course of the next ten thousand\r\nor twenty thousand years they will undergo any great alteration in their\r\nappearance, unless they should be shattered by earthquakes or covered by\r\nvolcanic ejections.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of Europe, as in Auvergne and Velay, in France, similar\r\nloose cones of scoriae, probably of as high antiquity as the whole mass\r\nof Etna, stand uninjured at inferior elevations above the level of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Volcanic eruption in Iceland in 1783--New island thrown up--Lava\r\n    currents of Skaptar Jokul, in same year--their immense\r\n    volume--Eruption of Jorullo in Mexico--Humboldt's theory of the\r\n    convexity of the plain of Malpais--Eruption of Galongoon in\r\n    Java--Submarine volcanoes--Graham island, formed in 1831--Volcanic\r\n    archipelagoes--Submarine eruptions in mid-Atlantic--The\r\n    Canaries--Teneriffe--Cones thrown up in Lancerote, 1730-36--Santorin\r\n    and its contiguous isles--Barren island in the Bay of Bengal--Mud\r\n    volcanoes--Mineral composition of volcanic products.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Volcanic eruptions in Iceland._--With the exception of Etna and\r\nVesuvius, the most complete chronological records of a series of\r\neruptions are those of Iceland, for their history reaches as far back as\r\nthe ninth century of our era; and, from the beginning of the twelfth\r\ncentury, there is clear evidence that, during the whole period, there\r\nhas never been an interval of more than forty, and very rarely one of\r\ntwenty years, without either an eruption or a great earthquake. So\r\nintense is the energy of the volcanic action in this region, that some\r\neruptions of Hecla have lasted six years without ceasing. Earthquakes\r\nhave often shaken the whole island at once, causing great changes in the\r\ninterior, such as the sinking down of hills, the rending of mountains,\r\nthe desertion by rivers of their channels, and the appearance of new\r\nlakes.[583] New islands have often been thrown up near the coast, some\r\nof which still exist; while others have disappeared, either by\r\nsubsidence or the action of the waves.\r\n\r\nIn the interval between eruptions, innumerable hot springs afford vent\r\nto subterranean heat, and solfataras discharge copious streams of\r\ninflammable matter. The volcanoes in different parts of this island are\r\nobserved, like those of the Phlegraean Fields, to be in activity by\r\nturns, one vent often serving for a time as a safety-valve to the rest.\r\nMany cones are often thrown up in one eruption, and in this case they\r\ntake a linear direction, running generally from northeast to southwest,\r\nfrom the northeastern part of the island, where the volcano Krabla lies,\r\nto the promontory Reykianas.\r\n\r\n_New island thrown up in 1783._--The convulsions of the year 1783 appear\r\nto have been more tremendous than any recorded in the modern annals of\r\nIceland; and the original Danish narrative of the catastrophe, drawn up\r\nin great detail, has since been substantiated by several English\r\ntravellers, particularly in regard to the prodigious extent of country\r\nlaid waste, and the volume of lava produced.[584] About a month previous\r\nto the eruption on the mainland, a submarine volcano burst forth in the\r\nsea in lat. 63 degrees 25 minutes N., long. 23 degrees 44 minutes W., at\r\na distance of thirty miles in a southwest direction from Cape Reykianas,\r\nand ejected so much pumice, that the ocean was covered with that\r\nsubstance to the distance of 150 miles, and ships were considerably\r\nimpeded in their course. A new island was thrown up, consisting of high\r\ncliffs, within which fire, smoke, and pumice were emitted from two or\r\nthree different points. This island was claimed by his Danish Majesty,\r\nwho denominated it Nyoe, or the New Island; but before a year had\r\nelapsed, the sea resumed its ancient domain, and nothing was left but a\r\nreef of rocks from five to thirty fathoms under water.\r\n\r\n_Great eruption of Skaptar Jokul._--Earthquakes which had long been felt\r\nin Iceland, became violent on the 11th of June, 1783, when Skaptar\r\nJokul, distant nearly 200 miles from Nyoe, threw out a torrent of lava\r\nwhich flowed down into the river Skapta, and completely dried it up. The\r\nchannel of the river was between high rocks, in many places from four\r\nhundred to six hundred feet in depth, and near two hundred in breadth.\r\nNot only did the lava fill up this great defile to the brink, but it\r\noverflowed the adjacent fields to a considerable extent. The burning\r\nflood, on issuing from the confined rocky gorge, was then arrested for\r\nsome time by a deep lake, which formerly existed in the course of the\r\nriver, between Skaptardal and Aa, which it entirely filled. The current\r\nthen advanced again, and reaching some ancient lava full of\r\nsubterraneous caverns, penetrated and melted down part of it; and in\r\nsome places, where the steam could not gain vent, it blew up the rock,\r\nthrowing fragments to the height of more than 150 feet. On the 18th of\r\nJune another ejection of liquid lava rushed from the volcano, which\r\nflowed down with amazing velocity over the surface of the first stream.\r\nBy the damming up of the mouths of some of the tributaries of the\r\nSkapta, many villages were completely overflowed with water, and thus\r\ngreat destruction of property was caused. The lava, after flowing for\r\nseveral days, was precipitated down a tremendous cataract called\r\nStapafoss, where it filled a profound abyss, which that great waterfall\r\nhad been hollowing out for ages, and after this, the fiery current\r\nagain continued its course.\r\n\r\nOn the third of August, fresh floods of lava still pouring from the\r\nvolcano, a new branch was sent off in a different direction; for the\r\nchannel of the Skapta was now so entirely choked up, and every opening\r\nto the west and north so obstructed, that the melted matter was forced\r\nto take a new course, so that it ran in a southeast direction, and\r\ndischarged itself into the bed of the river Hverfisfliot, where a scene\r\nof destruction scarcely inferior to the former was occasioned. These\r\nIcelandic lavas (like the ancient streams which are met with in\r\nAuvergne, and other provinces of Central France), are stated by\r\nStephenson to have accumulated to a prodigious depth in narrow rocky\r\ngorges; but when they came to wide alluvial plains, they spread\r\nthemselves out into broad burning lakes, sometimes from twelve to\r\nfifteen miles wide, and one hundred feet deep. When the \"fiery lake\"\r\nwhich filled up the lower portion of the valley of the Skapta, had been\r\naugmented by new supplies, the lava flowed up the course of the river to\r\nthe foot of the hills from whence the Skapta takes its rise. This\r\naffords a parallel case to one which can be shown to have happened at a\r\nremote era in the volcanic region of the Vivarais in France, where lava\r\nissued from the cone of Thueyts, and while one branch ran down, another\r\nmore powerful stream flowed up the channel of the river Ardeche.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the valley of the Skapta present superb ranges of basaltic\r\ncolumns of older lava, resembling those which are laid open in the\r\nvalleys descending from Mont Dor, in Auvergne, where more modern\r\nlava-currents, on a scale very inferior in magnitude to those of\r\nIceland, have also usurped the beds of the existing rivers. The eruption\r\nof Skaptar Jokul did not entirely cease till the end of two years; and\r\nwhen Mr. Paulson visited the tract eleven years afterwards, in 1794, he\r\nfound columns of smoke still rising from parts of the lava, and several\r\nrents filled with hot water.[585]\r\n\r\nAlthough the population of Iceland was very much scattered, and did not\r\nexceed fifty thousand, no less than twenty villages were destroyed,\r\nbesides those inundated by water; and more than nine thousand human\r\nbeings perished, together with an immense number of cattle, partly by\r\nthe depredations of the lava, partly by the noxious vapors which\r\nimpregnated the air, and, in part, by the famine caused by showers of\r\nashes throughout the island, and the desertion of the coasts by the\r\nfish.\r\n\r\n_Immense volume of the lava._--But the extraordinary volume of melted\r\nmatter produced in this eruption deserves the particular attention of\r\nthe geologist. Of the two branches, which flowed in nearly opposite\r\ndirections, the greatest was fifty, and the lesser forty miles in\r\nlength. The extreme breadth which the Skapta branch attained in the low\r\ncountries was from twelve to fifteen miles, that of the other about\r\nseven. The ordinary height of both currents was one hundred feet, but in\r\nnarrow defiles it sometimes amounted to six hundred. Professor Bischoff\r\nhas calculated that the mass of lava brought up from the subterranean\r\nregions by this single eruption \"surpassed in magnitude the bulk of Mont\r\nBlanc.\"[586] But a more distinct idea will be formed of the dimensions\r\nof the two streams, if we consider how striking a feature they would now\r\nform in the geology of England, had they been poured out on the bottom\r\nof the sea after the deposition and before the elevation of our\r\nsecondary and tertiary rocks. The same causes which have excavated\r\nvalleys through parts of our marine strata, once continuous, might have\r\nacted with equal force on the igneous rocks, leaving, at the same time,\r\na sufficient portion undestroyed to enable us to discover their former\r\nextent. Let us, then, imagine the termination of the Skapta branch of\r\nlava to rest on the escarpment of the inferior and middle oolite, where\r\nit commands the vale of Gloucester. The great platform might be one\r\nhundred feet thick, and from ten to fifteen miles broad, exceeding any\r\nwhich can be found in Central France. We may also suppose great tabular\r\nmasses to occur at intervals, capping the summit of the Cotswold Hills\r\nbetween Gloucester and Oxford, by Northleach, Burford, and other towns.\r\nThe wide valley of the Oxford clay would then occasion an interruption\r\nfor many miles; but the same rocks might recur on the summit of Cumnor\r\nand Shotover Hills, and all the other oolitic eminences of that\r\ndistrict. On the chalk of Berkshire, extensive plateaus, six or seven\r\nmiles wide, would again be formed; and lastly, crowning the highest\r\nsands of Highgate and Hampstead, we might behold some remnants of the\r\ncurrent five or six hundred feet in thickness, causing those hills to\r\nrival, or even to surpass, in height, Salisbury Craigs and Arthur's\r\nSeat.\r\n\r\nThe distance between the extreme points here indicated would not exceed\r\nninety miles in a direct line; and we might then add, at the distance of\r\nnearly two hundred miles from London, along the coast of Dorsetshire and\r\nDevonshire, for example, a great mass of igneous rocks, to represent\r\nthose of contemporary origin, which were produced beneath the level of\r\nthe sea, where the island of Nyoe rose up.\r\n\r\n_Volume of ancient and modern flows of lava compared._--Yet, gigantic as\r\nmust appear the scale of these modern volcanic operations, we must be\r\ncontent to regard them as perfectly insignificant in comparison to\r\ncurrents of the primeval ages, if we embrace the theoretical views of\r\nmany geologists, which were not inaccurately expressed by the late\r\nProfessor Alexander Brongniart, when he declared that \"aux apoques\r\ngaognostiques anciennes, tous les phanomenes gaologiques se passoient\r\ndans des dimensions _centuples_ de celles qu'ils prasentent\r\naujourd'hui.\"[587] Had Skaptar Jokul, therefore, been a volcano of the\r\nolden time, it would have poured forth lavas at a single eruption a\r\nhundred times more voluminous than those which were witnessed by the\r\npresent generation in 1783. But it may, on the contrary, be affirmed\r\nthat, among the older formations, no igneous rock of such colossal\r\nmagnitude has yet been met with; nay, it would be most difficult to\r\npoint out a mass of ancient date (distinctly referable to a single\r\neruption) which would even rival in volume the matter poured out from\r\nSkaptar Jokul in 1783.\r\n\r\n_Eruption of Jorullo in 1759._--As another example of the stupendous\r\nscale of modern volcanic eruptions, I may mention that of Jorullo in\r\nMexico, in 1759. The great region to which this mountain belongs has\r\nalready been described. The plain of Malpais forms part of an elevated\r\nplatform, between two and three thousand feet above the level of the\r\nsea, and is bounded by hills composed of basalt, trachyte, and volcanic\r\ntuff, clearly indicating that the country had previously, though\r\nprobably at a remote period, been the theatre of igneous action. From\r\nthe era of the discovery of the New World to the middle of the last\r\ncentury, the district had remained undisturbed, and the space, now the\r\nsite of the volcano, which is thirty-six leagues distant from the\r\nnearest sea, was occupied by fertile fields of sugar-cane and indigo,\r\nand watered by the two brooks Cuitimba and San Pedro. In the month of\r\nJune, 1759, hollow sounds of an alarming nature were heard, and\r\nearthquakes succeeded each other for two months, until, at the end of\r\nSeptember, flames issued from the ground, and fragments of burning rocks\r\nwere thrown to prodigious heights. Six volcanic cones, composed of\r\nscoriae and fragmentary lava, were formed on the line of a chasm which\r\nran in the direction from N. N. E. to S. S. W. The least of these cones\r\nwas 300 feet in height; and Jorullo, the central volcano, was elevated\r\n1600 feet above the level of the plain. It sent forth great streams of\r\nbasaltic lava, containing included fragments of granitic rocks, and its\r\nejections did not cease till the month of February, 1760.[588]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.\r\n\r\n_a_, Summit of Jorullo. _b_, _c_, Inclined plane sloping at an angle of\r\n6 degrees from the base of the cones.]\r\n\r\nHumboldt visited the country more than forty years after this\r\noccurrence, and was informed by the Indians, that when they returned,\r\nlong after the catastrophe, to the plain, they found the ground\r\nuninhabitable from the excessive heat. When he himself visited the\r\nplace, there appeared, around the base of the cones, and spreading from\r\nthem, as from a centre, over an extent of four square miles, a mass of\r\nmatter of a convex form, about 550 feet high at its junction with the\r\ncones, and gradually sloping from them in all directions towards the\r\nplain. This mass was still in a heated state, the temperature in the\r\nfissures being on the decrease from year to year, but in 1780 it was\r\nstill sufficient to light a cigar at the depth of a few inches. On this\r\nslightly convex protuberance, the slope of which must form an angle of\r\nabout 6 degrees with the horizon, were thousands of flattish conical\r\nmounds, from six to nine feet high, which, as well as large fissures\r\ntraversing the plain, acted as fumeroles, giving out clouds of\r\nsulphurous acid and hot aqueous vapor. The two small rivers before\r\nmentioned disappeared during the eruption, losing themselves below the\r\neastern extremity of the plain, and reappearing as hot springs at its\r\nwestern limit.\r\n\r\n_Cause of the convexity of the plain of Malpais._--Humboldt attributed\r\nthe convexity of the plain to inflation from below; supposing the\r\nground, for four square miles in extent, to have risen up in the shape\r\nof a bladder to the elevation of 550 feet above the plain in the highest\r\npart. But Mr. Scrope has suggested that the phenomena may be accounted\r\nfor far more naturally, by supposing that lava flowing simultaneously\r\nfrom the different orifices, and principally from Jorullo, united into a\r\nsort of pool or lake. As they were poured forth on a surface previously\r\nflat, they would, if their liquidity was not very great, remain thickest\r\nand deepest near their source, and diminish in bulk from thence towards\r\nthe limits of the space which they covered. Fresh supplies were probably\r\nemitted successively during the course of an eruption which lasted more\r\nthan half a year; and some of these, resting on those first emitted,\r\nmight only spread to a small distance from the foot of the cone, where\r\nthey would necessarily accumulate to a great height. The average slope\r\nof the great dome-shaped volcanoes of the Sandwich Islands, formed\r\nalmost exclusively of lava, with scarce any scoriae, is between 6\r\ndegrees 30 minutes and 7 degrees 46 minutes, so that the inclination of\r\nthe convex mass around Jorullo, if we adopt Mr. Scrope's explanation\r\n(see fig. 57), is quite in accordance with the known laws which govern\r\nthe flow of lava.\r\n\r\nThe showers, also, of loose and pulverulent matter from the six craters,\r\nand principally from Jorullo, would be composed of heavier and more\r\nbulky particles near the cones, and would raise the ground at their\r\nbase, where, mixing with rain, they might have given rise to the stratum\r\nof black clay, which is described as covering the lava. The small\r\nconical mounds (called \"hornitos,\" or little ovens) may resemble those\r\nfive or six small hillocks which existed in 1823 on the Vesuvian lava,\r\nand sent forth columns of vapor, having been produced by the\r\ndisengagement of elastic fluids heaping up small dome-shaped masses of\r\nlava. The fissures mentioned by Humboldt as of frequent occurrence, are\r\nsuch as might naturally accompany the consolidation of a thick bed of\r\nlava, contracting as it congeals; and the disappearance of rivers is the\r\nusual result of the occupation of the lower part of a valley or plain by\r\nlava, of which there are many beautiful examples in the old\r\nlava-currents of Auvergne. The heat of the \"hornitos\" is stated to have\r\ndiminished from the first; and Mr. Bullock, who visited the spot many\r\nyears after Humboldt, found the temperature of the hot spring very\r\nlow,--a fact which seems clearly to indicate the gradual congelation of\r\na subjacent bed of lava, which from its immense thickness may have been\r\nenabled to retain its heat for half a century. The reader may be\r\nreminded, that when we thus suppose the lava near the volcano to have\r\nbeen, together with the ejected ashes, more than five hundred feet in\r\ndepth, we merely assign a thickness which the current of Skaptar Jokul\r\nattained in some places in 1783.\r\n\r\n_Hollow sound of the plain when struck._--Another argument adduced in\r\nsupport of the theory of inflation from below, was, the hollow sound\r\nmade by the steps of a horse upon the plain; which, however, proves\r\nnothing more than that the materials of which the convex mass is\r\ncomposed are light and porous. The sound called \"rimbombo\" by the\r\nItalians is very commonly returned by _made ground_ when struck sharply;\r\nand has been observed not only on the sides of Vesuvius and other\r\nvolcanic cones where there is a cavity below, but in such regions as the\r\nCampagna di Roma, composed in a great measure of tuff and porous\r\nvolcanic rocks. The reverberation, however, may perhaps be assisted by\r\ngrottoes and caverns, for these may be as numerous in the lavas of\r\nJorullo as in many of those of Etna; but their existence would lend no\r\ncountenance to the hypothesis of a great arched cavity, four square\r\nmiles in extent, and in the centre 550 feet high.[589]\r\n\r\n_No recent eruptions of Jorullo._--In a former edition I stated that I\r\nhad been informed by Captain Vetch, that in 1819 a tower at Guadalaxara\r\nwas thrown down by an earthquake, and that ashes, supposed to have come\r\nfrom Jorullo, fell at the same time at Guanaxuato, a town situated 140\r\nEnglish miles from the volcano. But Mr. Burkhardt, a German director of\r\nmines, who examined Jorullo in 1827, ascertained that there had been no\r\neruption there since Humboldt's visit in 1803. He went to the bottom of\r\nthe crater, and observed a slight evolution of sulphurous acid vapors,\r\nbut the \"hornitos\" had entirely ceased to send forth steam. During the\r\ntwenty-four years intervening between his visit and that of Humboldt,\r\nvegetation had made great progress on the flanks of the new hills; the\r\nrich soil of the surrounding country was once more covered with\r\nluxuriant crops of sugar-cane and indigo, and there was an abundant\r\ngrowth of natural underwood on all the uncultivated tracts.[590]\r\n\r\n_Galongoon, Java_, 1822.--The mountain of Galongoon (or Galung Gung) was\r\nin 1822 covered by a dense forest, and situated in a fruitful and\r\nthickly-peopled part of Java. There was a circular hollow at its summit,\r\nbut no tradition existed of any former eruption. In July, 1822, the\r\nwaters of the river Kunir, one of those which flowed from its flanks,\r\nbecame for a time hot and turbid. On the 8th of October following a loud\r\nexplosion was heard, the earth shook, and immense columns of hot water\r\nand boiling mud, mixed with burning brimstone, ashes, and lapilli, of\r\nthe size of nuts, were projected from the mountain like a waterspout,\r\nwith such prodigious violence that large quantities fell beyond the\r\nriver Tandoi, which is forty miles distant. Every valley within the\r\nrange of this eruption became filled with a burning torrent, and the\r\nrivers, swollen with hot water and mud, overflowed their banks, and\r\ncarried away great numbers of the people, who were endeavoring to\r\nescape, and the bodies of cattle, wild beasts, and birds. A space of\r\ntwenty-four miles between the mountain and the river Tandoi was covered\r\nto such a depth with bluish mud that people were buried in their houses,\r\nand not a trace of the numerous villages and plantations throughout that\r\nextent was visible. Within this space the bodies of those who perished\r\nwere buried in mud and concealed, but near the limits of the volcanic\r\naction they were exposed, and strewed over the ground in great numbers,\r\npartly boiled and partly burnt.\r\n\r\nIt was remarked, that the boiling mud and cinders were projected with\r\nsuch violence from the mountain, that while many remote villages were\r\nutterly destroyed and buried, others much nearer the volcano were\r\nscarcely injured.\r\n\r\nThe first eruption lasted nearly five hours, and on the following days\r\nthe rain fell in torrents, and the rivers, densely charged with mud,\r\ndeluged the country far and wide. At the end of four days (October 12th)\r\na second eruption occurred more violent than the first, in which hot\r\nwater and mud were again vomited, and great blocks of basalt were thrown\r\nto the distance of seven miles from the volcano. There was at the same\r\ntime a violent earthquake, and in one account it is stated that the face\r\nof the mountain was utterly changed, its summits broken down, and one\r\nside, which had been covered with trees, became an enormous gulf in the\r\nform of a semicircle. This cavity was about midway between the summit\r\nand the plain, and surrounded by steep rocks, said to be newly heaped up\r\nduring the eruption. New hills and valleys are said to have been formed,\r\nand the rivers Banjarang and Wulan changed their course, and in one\r\nnight (October 12th) 2000 persons were killed.\r\n\r\nThe first intimation which the inhabitants of Bandong received of this\r\ncalamity on the 8th of October, was the news that the river Wulna was\r\nbearing down into the sea the dead bodies of men, and the carcasses of\r\nstags, rhinoceroses, tigers, and other animals. The Dutch painter Payen\r\ndetermined to travel from thence to the volcano, and he found that the\r\nquantity of the ashes diminished as he approached the base of the\r\nmountain. He alludes to the altered form of the mountain after the 12th,\r\nbut does not describe the new semicircular gulf on its side.\r\n\r\nThe official accounts state that 114 villages were destroyed, and above\r\n4000 persons killed.[591]\r\n\r\n_Submarine volcanoes._--Although we have every reason to believe that\r\nvolcanic eruptions as well as earthquakes are common in the bed of the\r\nsea, it was not to be expected that many opportunities would occur to\r\nscientific observers of witnessing the phenomena. The crews of vessels\r\nhave sometimes reported that they have seen in different places\r\nsulphurous smoke, flame, jets of water, and steam, rising up from the\r\nsea, or they have observed the waters greatly discolored, and in a state\r\nof violent agitation as if boiling. New shoals have also been\r\nencountered, or a reef of rocks just emerging above the surface, where\r\npreviously there was always supposed to have been deep water. On some\r\nfew occasions the gradual formation of an island by a submarine eruption\r\nhas been observed, as that of Sabrina, in the year 1811, off St.\r\nMichael's in the Azores. The throwing up of ashes in that case, and the\r\nformation of a cone about three hundred feet in height, with a crater in\r\nthe centre, closely resembled the phenomena usually accompanying a\r\nvolcanic eruption on land. Sabrina was soon washed away by the waves.\r\nPrevious eruptions in the same part of the sea were recorded to have\r\nhappened in 1691 and 1720. The rise of Nyoe, also, a small island off\r\nthe coast of Iceland, in 1783, has already been alluded to; and another\r\nvolcanic isle was produced by an eruption near Reikiavig, on the same\r\ncoast, in June, 1830.[592]\r\n\r\n_Graham Island_[593], 1831.--We have still more recent and minute\r\ninformation respecting the appearance, in 1831, of a new volcanic island\r\nin the Mediterranean, between the S. W. coast of Sicily and that\r\nprojecting part of the African coast where ancient Carthage stood. The\r\nsite of the island was not any part of the great shoal, or bank, called\r\n\"Nerita,\" as was first asserted, but a spot where Captain W. H. Smyth\r\nhad found, in his survey a few years before, a depth of more than one\r\nhundred fathoms water.[594]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58. Form of the cliffs of Graham Island, as seen\r\nfrom S. S. E., distant one mile, 7th August, 1831.[596]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59. View of the interior of Graham Island, 29th\r\nSept., 1831.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60. Graham Island, 29th Sept., 1831.[597]]\r\n\r\nThe position of the island (lat. 37 degrees 8 minutes 30\" N., long. 12\r\ndegrees 42 minutes 15\" E.) was about thirty miles S. W. of Sciacca, in\r\nSicily, and thirty-three miles N. E. of Pantellaria.[595] On the 28th of\r\nJune, about a fortnight before the eruption was visible, Sir Pulteney\r\nMalcolm, in passing over the spot in his ship, felt the shocks of an\r\nearthquake, as if he had struck on a sand-bank; and the same shocks were\r\nfelt on the west coast of Sicily, in a direction from S. W. to N. E.\r\nAbout the 10th of July, John Corrao, the captain of a Sicilian vessel,\r\nreported that, as he passed near the place, he saw a column of water\r\nlike a water-spout, sixty feet high, and 800 yards in circumference,\r\nrising from the sea, and soon afterwards a dense steam in its place,\r\nwhich ascended to the height of 1800 feet. The same Corrao, on his\r\nreturn from Girgenti, on the 18th of July, found a small island, twelve\r\nfeet high with a crater in its centre, ejecting volcanic matter, and\r\nimmense columns of vapor; the sea around being covered with floating\r\ncinders and dead fish. The scoriae were of a chocolate color, and the\r\nwater which boiled in the circular basin was of a dingy red. The\r\neruption continued with great violence to the end of the same month; at\r\nwhich time the island was visited by several persons, and among others\r\nby Capt. Swinburne, R. N., and M. Hoffmann, the Prussian geologist. It\r\nwas then from fifty to ninety feet in height, and three-quarters of a\r\nmile in circumference. By the 4th of August it became, according to some\r\naccounts, above 200 feet high, and three miles in circumference; after\r\nwhich it began to diminish in size by the action of the waves, and it\r\nwas only two miles round on the 25th of August; and on the 3d of\r\nSeptember, when it was carefully examined by Captain Wodehouse, only\r\nthree-fifths of a mile in circumference; its greatest height being then\r\n107 feet. At this time the crater was about 780 feet in circumference.\r\nOn the 29th of September, when it was visited by Mons. C. Prevost, its\r\ncircumference was reduced to about 700 yards. It was composed entirely\r\nof incoherent ejected matter, scoriae, pumice, and lapilli, forming\r\nregular strata, some of which are described as having been parallel to\r\nthe steep inward slope of the crater, while the rest were inclined\r\noutwards, like those of Vesuvius.[598] When the arrangement of the\r\nejected materials has been determined by their falling continually on\r\ntwo steep slopes, that of the external cone and that of the crater,\r\nwhich is always a hollow inverted cone, a transverse section would\r\nprobably resemble that given in the annexed figure (61). But when I\r\nvisited Vesuvius, in 1828, I saw no beds of scoriae inclined towards the\r\naxis of the cone. (See fig. 45, p. 381.) Such may have once existed; but\r\nthe explosions or subsidences, or whatever causes produced the great\r\ncrater of 1822, had possibly destroyed them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.]\r\n\r\nFew of the pieces of stone thrown out from Graham Island exceeded a foot\r\nin diameter. Some fragments of dolomitic limestone were intermixed; but\r\nthese were the only non-volcanic substances. During the month of August,\r\nthere occurred on the S. W. side of the new island a violent ebullition\r\nand agitation of the sea, accompanied by the constant ascension of a\r\ncolumn of dense white steam, indicating the existence of a second vent\r\nat no great depth from the surface. Towards the close of October, no\r\nvestige of the crater remained, and the island was nearly levelled with\r\nthe surface of the ocean, with the exception, at one point, of a small\r\nmonticule of sand and scoriae. It was reported that, at the commencement\r\nof the year following (1832), there was a depth of 150 feet where the\r\nisland had been: but this account was quite erroneous; for in the early\r\npart of that year Captain Swinburne found a shoal and discolored water\r\nthere, and towards the end of 1833 a dangerous reef existed of an oval\r\nfigure, about three-fifths of a mile in extent. In the centre was a\r\nblack rock, of the diameter of about twenty-six fathoms, from nine to\r\neleven feet under water; and round this rock are banks of black volcanic\r\nstones and loose sand. At the distance of sixty fathoms from this\r\ncentral mass, the depth increased rapidly. There was also a second shoal\r\nat the distance of 450 feet S. W. of the great reef, with fifteen feet\r\nwater over it, also composed of rock, surrounded by deep sea. We can\r\nscarcely doubt that the rock in the middle of the larger reef is solid\r\nlava, which rose up in the principal crater, and that the second shoal\r\nmarks the site of the submarine eruption observed in August, 1831, to\r\nthe S. W. of the island.\r\n\r\nFrom the whole of the facts above detailed, it appears that a hill eight\r\nhundred feet or more in height was formed by a submarine volcanic vent,\r\nof which the upper part (only about two hundred feet high) emerged above\r\nthe waters, so as to form an island. This cone must have been equal in\r\nsize to one of the largest of the lateral volcanoes on the flanks of\r\nEtna, and about half the height of the mountain Jorullo in Mexico, which\r\nwas formed in the course of nine months, in 1759. In the centre of the\r\nnew volcano a large cavity was kept open by gaseous discharges, which\r\nthrew out scoriae; and fluid lava probably rose up in this cavity. It is\r\nnot uncommon for small subsidiary craters to open near the summit of a\r\ncone, and one of these may have been formed in the case of Graham\r\nIsland; a vent, perhaps, connected with the main channel of discharge\r\nwhich gave passage in that direction to elastic fluids, scoriae, and\r\nmelted lava. It does not appear that, either from this duct, or from the\r\nprincipal vent, there was any overflowing of lava; but melted rock may\r\nhave flowed from the flanks or base of the cone (a common occurrence on\r\nland), and may have spread in a broad sheet over the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.\r\n\r\nSupposed section of Graham Island. (C. Maclaren.[599])]\r\n\r\nThe dotted lines in the annexed figure are an imaginary restoration of\r\nthe upper part of the cone, now removed by the waves: the strong lines\r\nrepresent the part of the volcano which is still under water: in the\r\ncentre is a great column, or dike, of solid lava, two hundred feet in\r\ndiameter, supposed to fill the space by which the gaseous fluids rose;\r\nand on each side of the dike is a stratified mass of scoriae and\r\nfragmentary lava. The solid nucleus of the reef, where the black rock is\r\nnow found, withstands the movements of the sea; while the surrounding\r\nloose tuffs are cut away to a somewhat lower level. In this manner the\r\nlava, which was the lowest part of the island, or, to speak more\r\ncorrectly, which scarcely ever rose above the level of the sea when the\r\nisland existed, has now become the highest point in the reef.\r\n\r\nNo appearances observed, either during the eruption or since the island\r\ndisappeared, gave the least support to the opinion promulgated by some\r\nwriters, that part of the ancient bed of the sea had been lifted up\r\nbodily.\r\n\r\nThe solid products, says Dr. John Davy, whether they consisted of sand,\r\nlight cinders, or vesicular lava, differed more in form than in\r\ncomposition. The lava contained augite; and the specific gravity was\r\n2.07 and 2.70. When the light spongy cinder, which floated on the sea,\r\nwas reduced to fine powder by trituration, and the greater part of the\r\nentangled air got rid of, it was found to be of the specific gravity\r\n2.64; and that of some of the sand which fell in the eruption was\r\n2.75;[600] so that the materials equalled ordinary granites in weight\r\nand solidity. The only gas evolved in any considerable quantity was\r\ncarbonic acid.[601]\r\n\r\n_Submarine eruptions in mid-Atlantic._--In the Nautical Magazine for\r\n1835, p. 642, and for 1838, p. 361, and in the Comptes Rendus, April,\r\n1838, accounts are given of a series of volcanic phenomena, earthquakes,\r\ntroubled water, floating scoriae and columns of smoke, which have been\r\nobserved at intervals since the middle of the last century, in a space\r\nof open sea between longitudes 20 degrees and 22 degrees west, about\r\nhalf a degree south of the equator. These facts, says Mr. Darwin, seem\r\nto show, that an island or an archipelago is in process of formation in\r\nthe middle of the Atlantic; a line joining St. Helena and Ascension\r\nwould, if prolonged, intersect this slowly nascent focus of volcanic\r\naction.[602] Should land be eventually formed here, it will not be the\r\nfirst that has been produced by igneous action in this ocean since it\r\nwas inhabited by the existing species of testacea. At Porto Praya in St.\r\nJago, one of the Azores, a horizontal, calcareous stratum occurs,\r\ncontaining shells of recent marine species, covered by a great sheet of\r\nbasalt eighty feet thick.[603] It would be difficult to estimate too\r\nhighly the commercial and political importance which a group of islands\r\nmight acquire, if in the next two or three thousand years they should\r\nrise in mid-ocean between St. Helena and Ascension.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANARY ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n_Eruption in Lancerote, 1730 to 1736._--The effects of an eruption which\r\nhappened in Lancerote, one of the Canary Islands, between the years 1730\r\nand 1736, were very remarkable; and a detailed description has been\r\npublished by Von Buch, who had an opportunity, when he visited that\r\nisland in 1815, of comparing the accounts transmitted to us of the\r\nevent, with the present state and geological appearances of the\r\ncountry.[604] On the 1st of September, 1730, the earth split open on a\r\nsudden two leagues from Yaira. In one night a considerable hill of\r\nejected matter was thrown up; and, a few days later, another vent\r\nopened, and gave out a lava-stream, which overran Chinanfaya and other\r\nvillages. It flowed first rapidly, like water, but became afterwards\r\nheavy and slow, like honey. On the 7th of September an immense rock was\r\nprotruded from the bottom of the lava with a noise like thunder, and the\r\nstream was forced to change its course from N. to N. W., so that St.\r\nCatalina and other villages were overflowed.\r\n\r\nWhether this mass was protruded by an earthquake, or was a mass of\r\nancient lava, blown up like that before mentioned in 1783 in Iceland, is\r\nnot explained.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of September more lava flowed out, and covered the village\r\nof Maso entirely, and for the space of eight days precipitated itself\r\nwith a horrible roar into the sea. Dead fish floated on the waters in\r\nindescribable multitudes, or were thrown dying on the shore. After a\r\nbrief interval of repose, three new openings broke forth immediately\r\nfrom the site of the consumed St. Catalina, and sent out an enormous\r\nquantity of lapilli, sand, and ashes. On the 28th of October the cattle\r\nthroughout the whole country dropped lifeless to the ground, suffocated\r\nby putrid vapors, which condensed and fell down in drops. On the 1st of\r\nDecember a lava-stream reached the sea, and formed an island, round\r\nwhich dead fish were strewed.\r\n\r\n_Number of cones thrown up._--It is unnecessary here to give the details\r\nof the overwhelming of other places by fiery torrents, or of a storm\r\nwhich was equally new and terrifying to the inhabitants, as they had\r\nnever known one in their country before. On the 10th of January, 1731, a\r\nhigh hill was thrown up, which, on the same day, precipitated itself\r\nback again into its own crater; fiery brooks of lava flowed from it to\r\nthe sea. On the 3d of February a new cone arose. Others were thrown up\r\nin March, and poured forth lava-streams. Numerous other volcanic cones\r\nwere subsequently formed in succession, till at last their number\r\namounted to about thirty. In June, 1731, during a renewal of the\r\neruptions, all the banks and shores in the western part of the island\r\nwere covered with dying fish, of different species, some of which had\r\nnever before been seen. Smoke and flame arose from the sea, with loud\r\ndetonations. These dreadful commotions lasted without interruption for\r\n_five successive years_, so that a great emigration of the inhabitants\r\nbecame necessary.\r\n\r\n_Their linear direction._--As to the height of the new cones, Von Buch\r\nwas assured that the formerly great and flourishing St. Catalina lay\r\nburied under hills 400 feet in height; and he observes that the most\r\nelevated cone of the series rose 600 feet above its base, and 1378 feet\r\nabove the sea, and that several others were nearly as high. The new\r\nvents were all arranged _in one line_, about two geographical miles\r\nlong, and in a direction nearly east and west. If we admit the\r\nprobability of Von Buch's conjecture, that these vents opened along the\r\nline of a cleft, it seems necessary to suppose that this subterranean\r\nfissure was only prolonged upwards to the surface by degrees, and that\r\nthe rent was narrow at first, as is usually the case with fissures\r\ncaused by earthquakes. Lava and elastic fluids might escape from some\r\npoint on the rent where there was least resistance, till, the first\r\naperture becoming obstructed by ejections and the consolidation of lava,\r\nother orifices burst open in succession along the line of the original\r\nfissure. Von Buch found that each crater was lowest on that side on\r\nwhich lava had issued; but some craters were not breached, and were\r\nwithout any lava streams. In one of these were open fissures, out of\r\nwhich hot vapors rose, which in 1815 raised the thermometer to 145 degrees\r\nFahrenheit, and was probably at the boiling point lower down. The\r\nexhalations seemed to consist of aqueous vapor; yet they could not be\r\npure steam, for the crevices were incrusted on either side by siliceous\r\nsinter (an opal-like hydrate of silica of a white color), which extended\r\nalmost to the middle. This important fact attests the length of time\r\nduring which chemical processes continue after eruptions, and how open\r\nfissures may be filled up laterally by mineral matter, sublimed from\r\nvolcanic exhalations. The lavas of this eruption covered nearly a third\r\nof the whole island, often forming on slightly inclined planes great\r\nhorizontal sheets several square leagues in area, resembling very much\r\nthe basaltic platforms of Auvergne.\r\n\r\n_Pretended distinction between ancient and modern lavas._--One of the\r\nnew lavas was observed to contain masses of olivine of an olive-green\r\ncolor, resembling those which occur in one of the lavas of the Vivarais.\r\nVon Buch supposes the great crystals of olivine to have been derived\r\nfrom a previously existing basalt melted up by the new volcanoes; but we\r\nhave scarcely sufficient data to bear out such a conjecture. The older\r\nrocks of the island consist, in a great measure, of that kind of\r\nbasaltic lava called dolerite, sometimes columnar, and partly of common\r\nbasalt and amygdaloid. Some recent lavas assumed, on entering the sea, a\r\nprismatic form, and so much resembled the older lavas of the Canaries,\r\nthat the only geological distinction which Von Buch appears to have been\r\nable to draw between them was, that they did not alternate with\r\nconglomerates, like the ancient basalts. Some modern writers have\r\nendeavored to discover, in the abundance of these conglomerates, a proof\r\nof the dissimilarity of the volcanic action in ancient and modern times;\r\nbut this character is more probably attributable to the difference\r\nbetween submarine operations and those on the land. All the blocks and\r\nimperfectly rounded fragments of lava, transported during the intervals\r\nof eruption, by rivers and torrents, into the adjoining sea, or torn by\r\nthe continued action of the waves from cliffs which are undermined, must\r\naccumulate in stratified breccias and conglomerates, and be covered\r\nagain and again by other lavas. This is now taking place on the shores\r\nof Sicily, between Catania and Trezza, where the sea breaks down and\r\ncovers the shore with blocks and pebbles of the modern lavas of Etna;\r\nand on parts of the coast of Ischia, where numerous currents of trachyte\r\nare in like manner undermined in lofty precipices. So often, then, as an\r\nisland is raised in a volcanic archipelago by earthquakes from the deep,\r\nthe fundamental and (relatively to all above) the oldest lava will often\r\nbe distinguishable from those formed by subsequent eruptions on dry\r\nland, by their alternation with beds of sandstone and fragmentary rocks.\r\n\r\nThe supposed want of identity, then, between the volcanic phenomena of\r\ndifferent epochs resolves itself partly at least into the marked\r\ndifference between the operations simultaneously in progress, above and\r\nbelow the waters. Such, indeed, is the source, as was before stated in\r\nthe First Book (Chap. V.), of many of our strongest theoretical\r\nprejudices in geology. No sooner do we study and endeavor to explain\r\nsubmarine appearances, than we feel, to use a common expression, out of\r\nour element; and unwilling to concede that our extreme ignorance of\r\nprocesses now continually going on can be the cause of our perplexity,\r\nwe take refuge in a \"pre-existent order of nature.\"\r\n\r\n_Recent formation of oolitic travertin in Lancerote._--Throughout a\r\nconsiderable part of Lancerote, the old lavas are covered by a thin\r\nstratum of limestone, from an inch to two feet in thickness. It is of a\r\nhard stalactitic nature, sometimes oolitic, like the Jura limestone, and\r\ncontains fragments of lava and terrestrial shells, chiefly helices and\r\nspiral bulimi. It sometimes rises to the height of 800 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea. Von Buch imagines that this remarkable superstratum\r\nhas been produced by the furious northwest storms, which in winter drive\r\nthe spray of the sea in clouds over the whole island; from whence\r\ncalcareous particles may be deposited stalactitically. Mr. Darwin\r\ninforms me that he found a limestone in St. Helena, the harder parts of\r\nwhich correspond precisely to the stone of Lancerote. He attributes the\r\norigin of this rock in St. Helena not to the spray of the sea, but to\r\ndrifting by violent winds of the finer particles of shells from the\r\nsea-beach. Some parts of this drift are subsequently dissolved by\r\natmospheric moisture, and redeposited, so as to convert calcareous sand\r\ninto oolite.\r\n\r\n_Recent eruption in Lancerote._--From the year 1736 to 1815, when Von\r\nBuch visited Lancerote, there had been no eruption; but, in August,\r\n1824, a crater opened near the port of Rescif, and formed by its\r\nejections, in the space of twenty-four hours, a considerable hill.\r\nViolent earthquakes preceded and accompanied this eruption.[605]\r\n\r\n_Teneriffe._--The Peak of Teneriffe is about 12,000 feet high, and\r\nstands, says Von Buch, like a tower encircled by its fosse and bastion.\r\nThe bastion consists, like the semicircular escarpment of Somma turned\r\ntowards Vesuvius, of precipitous cliffs, composed of trachyte, basalt,\r\ncoarse conglomerates, and tuffs, traversed by volcanic dikes, mostly\r\nvertical, and of basalt. These cliffs vary in height from 1000 to 1800\r\nfeet, and are supposed by Von Buch to have been heaved up into their\r\npresent position by a force exerted from below, in accordance with the\r\ntheory proposed by the same author for the origin of the cones of\r\nVesuvius and Etna. According to the observations of M. Deville in\r\n1839[606], the trachytes are often granitoid in their aspect, and\r\ncontain instead of glassy felspar the allied mineral called oligoclase,\r\nwhich had been previously considered as characteristic of more ancient\r\nigneous rocks. The same traveller supposes, although he found no\r\nlimestone or trace of fossils in any of the rocks of Teneriffe, that the\r\nalternating trachytes and trachytic conglomerates originated beneath the\r\nsea. If this opinion be correct, and it is at least very probable,\r\ngeologists may still speculate on two modes in which the mass of the\r\nisland acquired its present form and elevation above the sea. 1st, The\r\nadvocates of Von Buch's crater-of-elevation hypothesis may imagine that\r\na succession of horizontally superimposed beds were upheaved by a sudden\r\nmovement, and tilted so as to dip in all directions outwards from the\r\ncentre of a new dome-shaped eminence, in the middle of which a large\r\nopening or bowl-shaped cavity was produced. 2dly, Or according to the\r\ntheory which to me appears preferable, a submarine hill in the form of a\r\nflattened dome may have gradually accumulated, partly below the waters\r\nand partly above by the continued outpourings of sheets of lava and the\r\nejection of ashes from a central orifice. In this case the dikes would\r\nrepresent the fissures, which were filled during successive eruptions,\r\nand the original inclination of the beds may have been increased by the\r\ndistension and upheaval of the mass during reiterated convulsions,\r\nacting most forcibly at or near the channel of discharge, which would\r\nbecome partially sealed up with lava from time to time, and then be\r\nburst open again during eruptions. At length the whole island may have\r\nbeen raised bodily out of the sea by a gradual upward movement.\r\n\r\nWhatever theory we adopt, we must always explain the abrupt termination\r\nof the dikes and layers of trachyte and basalt in the steep walls of the\r\nescarpments surrounding the great crater by supposing the removal of\r\npart of the materials once prolonged farther inward towards the centre.\r\nIf, according to the elevation-crater hypothesis, a series of sheets of\r\nlava and ashes originally spread over a level and even surface have been\r\nviolently broken and uplifted, why do not the opposite walls of the\r\nchasm correspond in such a manner as to imply by their present outline\r\nthat they were formerly united? It is evident that the precipices on\r\nopposite sides of the crateriform hollow would not fit if brought\r\ntogether, there being no projecting masses in one wall to enter into\r\nindentations in the other, as would happen with the sides of many\r\nmineral veins, trap-dikes, and faults, could we extract the intrusive\r\nmatter now separating them, and reunite the rocks which have been\r\nfractured and disjoined.\r\n\r\nThe highest crater of the peak has merely disengaged sulphureous vapors\r\never since it has been known to Europeans; but an eruption happened in\r\nJune, 1798, not far from the summit, and others are recorded, which\r\npoured out streams of lava from great heights, besides many which have\r\nbroken out nearer the level of the sea. All these, however, seem to be\r\ndependent on one great centre of eruption, or on that open channel\r\ncommunicating between the interior of the earth and the atmosphere,\r\nwhich terminates in the highest crater of the peak.\r\n\r\nWe may consider Teneriffe, then, as having been from a remote period the\r\nprincipal and habitual vent of the volcanic archipelago of the Canaries.\r\nThe discharges which have taken place in the contiguous isles of Palma,\r\nLancerote, and the rest, may be of a subsidiary kind, and have probably\r\nbeen most frequent and violent when the greater crater has been\r\npartially sealed up, just as the violent eruptions of Ischia or that of\r\nMonte Nuovo coincided with the dormant state of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANTORIN.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf of Santorin, in the Grecian Archipelago, has been for two\r\nthousand years a scene of active volcanic operations. The largest of the\r\nthree outer islands of the group (to which the general name of Santorin\r\nis given) is called Thera (or sometimes Santorin), and forms more than\r\ntwo-thirds of the circuit of the gulf (see Map, fig. 63, p. 442). The\r\nlength of the exterior coast-line of this and the other two islands\r\nnamed Therasia and Aspronisi, taken together, amounts to about thirty\r\nmiles, and that of the inner coast-line of the same islands to about\r\neighteen miles. In the middle of the gulf are three other islands,\r\ncalled the Little, the New, and the Old \"Kaimenis,\" or \"Burnt Islands.\"\r\nThe accompanying map has been reduced from a recent survey executed in\r\n1848 by Captain Graves, R. N., and shortly to be published by the\r\nAdmiralty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.\r\n\r\nMap of Santorin in the Grecian Archipelago, from a Survey in 1848, by\r\nCaptain Graves, R.

E. and S. W. direction, from Thera through\r\nthe Kaimenia to Aspronisi.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.\r\n\r\nPart of the section, fig. 64, enlarged.]\r\n\r\nPliny informs us that the year 186, B. C., gave birth to the Old\r\nKaimeni, also called Hiera, or the \"Sacred Isle,\" and in the year 19 of\r\nour era \"Thia\" (the Divine) made its appearance above water, and was\r\nsoon joined by subsequent eruptions to the older island, from which it\r\nwas only 250 paces distant. The Old Kaimeni also increased successively\r\nin size in 726 and in 1427. A century and a half later, in 1573, another\r\neruption produced the cone and crater called Micra-Kaimeni, or \"the\r\nSmall Burnt Island.\" The next great event which we find recorded\r\noccurred in 1650, when a submarine outbreak violently agitated the sea,\r\nat a point three and a half miles to the N. E. of Thera, and which gave\r\nrise to a shoal (see A in the map) carefully examined during the late\r\nsurvey in 1848 by Captain Graves, and found to have ten fathoms water\r\nover it, the sea deepening around it in all directions. This eruption\r\nlasted three months, covering the sea with floating pumice. At the same\r\ntime an earthquake destroyed many houses in Thera, while the sea broke\r\nupon the coast and overthrew two churches, exposing to view two\r\nvillages, one on each side of the mountain of St. Stephen, both of\r\nwhich must have been overwhelmed by showers of volcanic matter during\r\nsome previous eruptions of unknown date.[607] The accompanying evolution\r\nof sulphur and hydrogen issuing from the sea killed more than fifty\r\npersons, and above 1000 domestic animals. A wave, also, 50 feet high,\r\nbroke upon the rocks of the Isle of Nia, about four leagues distant, and\r\nadvanced 450 yards into the interior of the Island of Sikino. Lastly, in\r\n1707 and 1709, Nea-Kaimeni, or the New Burnt Island, was formed between\r\nthe two others, Palaia and Micra, the Old and Little isles. This isle\r\nwas composed originally of two distinct parts; the first which rose was\r\ncalled the White Island, composed of a mass of pumice, extremely porous.\r\nGorce, the Jesuit, who was then in Santorin, says that the rock \"cut\r\nlike bread,\" and that, when the inhabitants landed on it, they found a\r\nmultitude of full-grown fresh oysters adhering to it, which they\r\nate.[608] This mass was afterwards covered, in great part, by the matter\r\nejected from the crater of a twin-island formed simultaneously, and\r\ncalled Black Island, consisting of brown trachyte. The trachytic lava\r\nwhich rose on this spot appears to have been a long time in an\r\nintumescent state, for the New Kaimeni was sometimes lowered on one side\r\nwhile it gained height on the other, and rocks rose up in the sea at\r\ndifferent distances from the shore and then disappeared again. The\r\neruption was renewed at intervals during the years 1711 and 1712, and at\r\nlength a cone was piled up to the height of 330 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea, its exterior slope forming an angle of 33 degrees with the\r\nhorizon, and the crater on its summit being 80 yards in diameter. In\r\naddition to the two points of subaerial eruption on the New and Little\r\nKaimenis, two other cones, indicating the sites of submarine outbursts\r\nof unknown date, were discovered under water near the Kaimenis during\r\nthe late survey.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the \"White Island,\" which was described and visited by\r\nGorce in 1707, we are indebted to Mr. Edward Forbes for having, in 1842,\r\ncarefully investigated the layer of pumiceous ash of which it is\r\nconstituted. He obtained from it many shells of marine genera,\r\nPectunculus, Arca, Cardita, Trochus, and others, both univalve and\r\nbivalve, all of recent Mediterranean species. They were in a fine state\r\nof preservation, the bivalves with the epidermis remaining, and valves\r\nclosed, showing that they had been suddenly destroyed. Mr. Forbes, from\r\nhis study of the habits of the mollusca living at different depths in\r\nthe Mediterranean, was able to decide that such an assemblage of species\r\ncould not have lived at a less depth than 220 feet, so that a bodily\r\nupheaval of the mass to that amount must have taken place in order to\r\nbring up this bed of ashes and shells to the level of the sea, and they\r\nnow rise five or six feet above that level.[609]\r\n\r\nWe may compare this partial elevation of solid matter to the rise of a\r\nhardened crust of scoriae, such as is usually formed on the surface of\r\nlava-currents, even while they are in motion, and which, although stony\r\nand capable of supporting heavy weights, may be upraised without\r\nbursting by the intumescence of the melted matter below. That the\r\nupheaval was merely local is proved by the fact that the neighboring\r\nKaimenis did not participate in the movement, still less the three more\r\ndistant or outer islands before mentioned. The history, therefore, of\r\nthe Kaimenis shows that they have been the result of intermittent\r\naction, and it lends no support to the hypothesis of the sudden\r\ndistension of horizontal beds blown up like a bladder by a single\r\nparoxysmal effort of expansive gases.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the accompanying map and sections, that the Kaimenis\r\nare arranged in a linear direction, running N. E. and S. W., in a manner\r\ndifferent from that represented in the older charts. In their longest\r\ndiameter they form at their base a ridge nearly bisecting the gulf or\r\ncrater (see sections, figs. 64, 65).\r\n\r\nOn considering these facts we are naturally led to compare the smaller\r\nand newer islands in the centre of the gulf to the modern cone of\r\nVesuvius, surrounded by the older semicircular escarpment of Somma, or\r\nto liken them to the Peak of Teneriffe before described, as surrounded\r\nby its \"fosse and bastion.\" This idea will appear to be still more fully\r\nconfirmed when we study the soundings taken during the late\r\nhydrographical survey. Thera, which constitutes alone more than\r\ntwo-thirds of the outer circuit, presents everywhere towards the gulf,\r\nhigh and steep precipices composed of rocks of volcanic origin. In all\r\nplaces near the base of its cliffs, a depth of from 800 to 1000 feet of\r\nwater was found, and Lieut. Leycester informs us[610] that if the gulf,\r\nwhich is six miles in diameter, could be drained, a bowl-shaped cavity\r\nwould appear with walls 2449 feet high in some places, and even on the\r\nsouthwest side, where it is lowest, nowhere less than 1200 feet high;\r\nwhile the Kaimenis would be seen to form in the centre a huge mountain\r\nfive and a half miles in circumference at its base, with three principal\r\nsummits (the Old, the New, and the Little Burnt Islands) rising\r\nseverally to the heights of 1251, 1629, and 1158 feet above the bottom\r\nof the abyss. The rim of the great caldron thus exposed would be\r\nobserved to be in all parts perfect and unbroken, except at one point\r\nwhere there is a deep and long chasm or channel, known by mariners as\r\n\"the northern entrance\" (B, fig. 63) between Thera and Therasia, and\r\ncalled by Lieut. Leycester \"the door into the crater.\" It is no less\r\nthan 1170 feet deep, and constitutes, as will appear by the soundings\r\n(see map), a remarkable feature in the bed of the sea. There is no\r\ncorresponding channel passing out from the gulf into the Mediterranean\r\nat any other point in the circuit between the outer islands, the\r\ngreatest depth there ranging from 7 to 66 feet.\r\n\r\nWe may conceive, therefore, if at some former time the whole mass of\r\nSantorin stood at a higher level by 1200 feet, that this single ravine\r\nor narrow valley now forming \"the northern entrance,\" was the passage by\r\nwhich the sea entered a circular bay and swept out in the form of mud\r\nand pebbles, the materials derived by denudation from wasting cliffs. In\r\nthis manner the original crater may have been slowly widened and\r\ndeepened, after which the whole archipelago may have been partially\r\nsubmerged to its present depth.\r\n\r\nThat such oscillations of level may in the course of ages have taken\r\nplace, will be the more readily admitted when we state that part of\r\nThera has actually sunk down in modern times, as, for example, during\r\nthe great earthquake before alluded to, which happened in 1650. The\r\nsubsidence alluded to is proved not only by tradition, but by the fact\r\nthat a road which formerly led between two places on the east coast of\r\nThera is now twelve fathoms under water.\r\n\r\nMM. Boblaye and Virlet mention,[611] that the waves are constantly\r\nundermining and encroaching on the cliffs of Therasia and Aspronisi, and\r\nshoals or submarine ledges were found, during the late survey, to occur\r\nround a great part of these islands, attesting the recent progress of\r\ndenudation. M. Virlet also remarks, in regard to the separation of the\r\nthree islands forming the walls of the crater, that the channels between\r\nthem are all to the W. and N. W., the quarter most exposed to the waves\r\nand currents.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, in his work on volcanic islands, has shown that in the\r\nMauritius and in Santiago, there is an external circle of basaltic rocks\r\nof vast diameter, in the interior of which more modern eruptions have\r\ntaken place, the older rocks dipping away from the central space in\r\nevery direction, as in the outer islands of Santorin. He refers the\r\nnumerous breaches, some of them very wide in the external ramparts of\r\nthose islands, to the denuding action of the sea. Every geologist,\r\ntherefore, will be prepared to call in the aid of the same powerful\r\ncause, to account for the removal of a large part of the rocks which\r\nmust once have occupied the interior space, in the same manner as they\r\nattribute the abstraction of matter from elliptical \"valleys of\r\nelevation,\" such as those of Woolhope and the Wealden in England, to the\r\nwaves and currents of the sea.\r\n\r\nThera, Therasia, and Aspronisi are all composed of volcanic matter,\r\nexcept the southern part of Thera, where Mount St. Elias rises to three\r\ntimes the height of the loftiest of the igneous rocks, reaching an\r\nelevation of 1887 feet above the sea.[612] This mountain is formed of\r\ngranular limestone and argillaceous schist, and must have been\r\noriginally a submarine eminence in the bed of the Mediterranean, before\r\nthe volcanic cone, one side of the base of which now abuts against it,\r\nwas formed. The inclination, strike, and fractures of the calcareous and\r\nargillaceous strata of St. Elias have no relation to the great cone,\r\nbut, according to M. Bory St. Vincent, have the same direction as those\r\nof the other isles of the Grecian Archipelago, namely, from N. N. W. to\r\nS. S. E. Each of the three islands, Thera, Therasia, and Aspronisi, is\r\ncapped by an enormous mass of white tufaceous conglomerate, from forty\r\nto fifty feet thick, beneath which are beds of trachytic lava and tuff,\r\nhaving a gentle inclination of only 3 degrees or 4 degrees. Each bed is\r\nusually very narrow and discontinuous, the successive layers being\r\nmoulded or dove-tailed, as M. Virlet expresses it, into the inequalities\r\nof the previously existing surface, on which showers of cinders or\r\nstreams of melted matter have been poured. Nothing, therefore, seems\r\nmore evident than that we have in Santorin the basal remains of a great\r\nruined cone, or flattened dome; and the absence of dikes in the cliffs\r\nsurrounding the gulf would indicate that the eruptions took place\r\noriginally, as they have done in the last two thousand years, not near\r\nthe margin but in the centre of the space now occupied by the gulf. The\r\ncentral portions of the dome have since been removed by engulfment, or\r\ndenudation, or by both these causes.\r\n\r\nAn important fact is adduced by M. Virlet, to show that the gentle dip\r\nof the lava-streams in the three outer islands towards all points of the\r\ncompass, away from the centre of the gulf, has not been due to the\r\nupheaval of horizontal beds, as conjectured by Von Buch, who had not\r\nvisited Santorin.[613] The French geologist found that the vesicles or\r\npores of the trachytic masses were lengthened out in the several\r\ndirections in which they would have flowed if they had descended from\r\nthe axis of a cone once occupying the centre of the crater. For it is\r\nwell known that the bubbles of confined gas in a fluid in motion assume\r\nan oval form, and the direction of their longer axis coincides always\r\nwith that of the stream.\r\n\r\nOn a review, therefore, of all the facts now brought to light respecting\r\nSantorin, I attribute the moderate slope of the beds in Thera and the\r\nother external islands to their having originally descended the inclined\r\nflanks of a large volcanic cone, the principal orifice or vents of\r\neruption having been always situated where they are now, in or near the\r\ncentre of the space occupied by the gulf or crater--in other words,\r\nwhere the outburst of the Kaimenis has been witnessed in historical\r\ntimes. The single long and deep opening into the crater is a feature\r\ncommon to all those remnants of ancient volcanoes, the central portions\r\nof which have been removed, and is probably connected with aqueous\r\ndenudation. This denuding process has been the work of ages when the sea\r\nwas admitted into an original crater, and has taken place during the\r\ngradual emergence of the island from the sea, or during various\r\noscillations in its level.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic island of St. Paul in the midst of the Indian Ocean, lat.\r\n38 degrees 44 minutes S., long. 77 degrees 37 minutes E., surveyed by\r\nCapt. Blackwood in 1842, seems to exemplify the first stage in the\r\nformation of such an archipelago as that of Santorin. We have there a\r\ncrater one mile in diameter, surrounded by steep and lofty cliffs on\r\nevery side save one, where the sea enters by a single passage nearly dry\r\nat low water. In the interior of the small circular bay or crater there\r\nis a depth of 30 fathoms, or 180 feet. The surface of the island slopes\r\naway on all sides from the crest of the rocks encircling the\r\ncrater.[614]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.\r\n\r\nCone and crater of Barren Island, in the Bay of Bengal. Height of the\r\ncentral cone (according to Capt Miller, in 1834), 500 feet.]\r\n\r\n_Barren Island._--There is great analogy between the structure of Barren\r\nIsland in the Bay of Bengal, lat. 12 degrees 15 minutes, and that of\r\nSantorin last described. When seen from the ocean, this island presents,\r\non almost all sides, a surface of bare rocks, rising, with a moderate\r\nacclivity, towards the interior; but at one point there is a cleft by\r\nwhich we can penetrate into the centre, and there discover that it is\r\noccupied by a great circular basin, filled by the waters of the sea, and\r\nbordered all around by steep rocks, in the midst of which rises a\r\nvolcanic cone, very frequently in eruption. The summit of this cone is\r\nabout 500 feet in height, corresponding to that of the circular border\r\nwhich incloses the basin; so that it can be seen from the sea only\r\nthrough the ravine. It is most probable that the exterior inclosure of\r\nBarren Island (_c_, _d_, fig. 67) is nothing more than the remains of a\r\ntruncated cone _c_, _a_, _b_, _d_, a great portion of which has been\r\nremoved by engulfment, explosion, or denudation, which may have preceded\r\nthe formation of the new interior cone, _f_, _e_, _g_.[615]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.\r\n\r\nSupposed section of Barren Island, in the Bay of Bengal.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMUD VOLCANOES.\r\n\r\n_Iceland._--Mr. R. Bunsen, in his account of the pseudo-volcanic\r\nphenomena of Iceland, describes many valleys where sulphurous and\r\naqueous vapors burst forth with a hissing sound, from the hot soil\r\nformed of volcanic tuff. In such spots a pool of boiling water is seen,\r\nin which a bluish-black argillaceous paste rises in huge bubbles. These\r\nbubbles on bursting throw the boiling mud to a height of fifteen feet\r\nand upwards, accumulating it in ledges round the crater or basin of the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n_Baku on the Caspian._--The formation of a new mud volcano was witnessed\r\non the 27th of November, 1827, at Tokmali, on the peninsula of\r\nAbscheron, east of Baku. Flames blazed up to an extraordinary height for\r\na space of three hours, and continued for twenty hours to rise about\r\nthree feet above a crater, from which mud was ejected. At another point\r\nin the same district where flames issued, fragments of rock of large\r\nsize were hurled up into the air, and scattered around.[616]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.\r\n\r\nMud cones and craters of Hinglaj near Beila, district of Lus, 120 miles\r\nnorthwest of mouth of Indus. From original drawing by Capt. Robertson.\r\n(See Map, p. 460.)]\r\n\r\n_Sicily._--At a place called Macaluba, near Girgenti in Sicily, are\r\nseveral conical mounds from ten to thirty feet in height, with small\r\ncraters at their summits, from which cold water, mixed with mud and\r\nbitumen, is cast out. Bubbles of carbonic acid and carburetted hydrogen\r\ngas are also disengaged from these springs, and at certain periods with\r\nsuch violence, as to throw the mud to the height of 200 feet. These \"air\r\nvolcanoes,\" as they are sometimes termed, are known to have been in the\r\nsame state of activity for the last fifteen centuries; and Dr. Daubeny\r\nimagines that the gases which escape may be generated by the slow\r\ncombustion of beds of sulphur, which is actually in progress in the blue\r\nclay, out of which the springs rise.[617] But as the gases are similar\r\nto those disengaged in volcanic eruptions, and as they have continued to\r\nstream out for so long a period, they may perhaps be derived from a more\r\ndeep-seated source.\r\n\r\n_Beila in India._--In the district of Luss or Lus, south of Beila, about\r\n120 miles N. W. of Cutch and the mouths of the Indus (see Map, fig. 71,\r\np. 460), numerous mud volcanoes are scattered over an area of probably\r\nnot less than 1000 square miles. Some of these have been well described\r\nby Captain Hart, and subsequently by Captain Robertson, who has paid a\r\nvisit to that region, and made sketches of them, which he has kindly\r\nplaced at my disposal. From one of these the annexed view has been\r\nselected. These conical hills occur to the westward of the Hara\r\nmountains and the river Hubb. (See Map, p. 460.) One of the cones is 400\r\nfeet high, composed of light-colored earth, and having at its summit a\r\ncrater thirty yards in diameter. The liquid mud which fills the crater\r\nis continually disturbed by air-bubbles, and here and there is cast up\r\nin small jets.[618]\r\n\r\n_Mineral composition of volcanic products._--The mineral called felspar\r\nforms in general more than half of the mass of modern lavas. When it is\r\nin great excess, lavas are called trachytic: they consist generally of a\r\nbase of compact felspar, in which crystals of glassy felspar are\r\ndisseminated.[619] When augite (or pyroxene) predominates, lavas are\r\ntermed basaltic. They contain about 50 per cent. of silica, or much less\r\nthan the trachytes, in which there is usually about 75 per cent. of that\r\nmineral. They also contain about 11 per cent. of protoxide of iron, and\r\nas much of lime, both of which are wanting, or only in insignificant\r\nquantities in the trachytic rocks.[620] But lavas occur of an\r\nintermediate composition between the trachytic and basaltic, which from\r\ntheir color have been called graystones. The abundance of quartz,\r\nforming distinct crystals or concretions, characterizes the granitic and\r\nother ancient rocks, now generally considered by geologists as of\r\nigneous origin; whereas that mineral is rarely exhibited in a separate\r\nform in recent lavas, although silica enters so largely into their\r\ncomposition. Hornblende, so common in hypogene rocks, or those commonly\r\ncalled \"primary,\" is rare in modern lava; nor does it enter largely into\r\nrocks of any age in which augite abounds. It should, however, be stated,\r\nthat the experiments of Mr. Gustav Rose have made it very questionable,\r\nwhether the minerals called hornblende and augite can be separated as\r\ndistinct species, as their different varieties seem to pass into each\r\nother, whether we consider the characters derived from their angles of\r\ncrystallization, their chemical composition, or their specific gravity.\r\nThe difference in form of the two substances may be explained by the\r\ndifferent circumstances under which they have been produced, the form\r\nof hornblende being the result of slower cooling. Crystals of augite\r\nhave been met with in the scoriae of furnaces, but never those of\r\nhornblende; and crystals of augite have been obtained by melting\r\nhornblende in a platina crucible; but hornblende itself has not been\r\nformed artificially.[621] Mica occurs plentifully in some recent\r\ntrachytes, but is rarely present where augite is in excess.\r\n\r\n_Frequency of eruptions, and nature of subterranean igneous\r\nrocks._--When we speak of the igneous rocks of our own times, we mean\r\nthat small portion which, in violent eruptions, is forced up by elastic\r\nfluids to the surface of the earth,--the sand, scoriae, and lava, which\r\ncool in the open air. But we cannot obtain access to that which is\r\ncongealed far beneath the surface under great pressure, equal to that of\r\nmany hundred, or many thousand atmospheres.\r\n\r\nDuring the last century, about fifty eruptions are recorded of the five\r\nEuropean volcanic districts, of Vesuvius, Etna, Volcano, Santorin, and\r\nIceland; but many beneath the sea in the Grecian archipelago and near\r\nIceland may doubtless have passed unnoticed. If some of them produced no\r\nlava, others, on the contrary, like that of Skaptar Jokul, in 1783,\r\npoured out melted matter for five or six years consecutively; which\r\ncases, being reckoned as single eruptions, will compensate for those of\r\ninferior strength. Now, if we consider the active volcanoes of Europe to\r\nconstitute about a fortieth part of those already known on the globe,\r\nand calculate that, one with another, they are about equal in activity\r\nto the burning mountains in other districts, we may then compute that\r\nthere happen on the earth about 2000 eruptions in the course of a\r\ncentury, or about twenty every year.\r\n\r\nHowever inconsiderable, therefore, may be the superficial rocks which\r\nthe operations of fire produce on the surface, we must suppose the\r\nsubterranean changes now constantly in progress to be on the grandest\r\nscale. The loftiest volcanic cones must be as insignificant, when\r\ncontrasted to the products of fire in the nether regions, as are the\r\ndeposits formed in shallow estuaries when compared to submarine\r\nformations accumulating in the abysses of the ocean. In regard to the\r\ncharacters of these volcanic rocks, formed in our own times in the\r\nbowels of the earth, whether in rents and caverns, or by the cooling of\r\nlakes of melted lava, we may safely infer that the rocks are heavier and\r\nless porous than ordinary lavas, and more crystalline, although composed\r\nof the same mineral ingredients. As the hardest crystals produced\r\nartificially in the laboratory require the longest time for their\r\nformation, so we must suppose that where the cooling down of melted\r\nmatter takes place by insensible degrees, in the course of ages, a\r\nvariety of minerals will be produced far harder than any formed by\r\nnatural processes within the short period of human observation.\r\n\r\nThese subterranean volcanic rocks, moreover, cannot be stratified in the\r\nsame manner as sedimentary deposits from water, although it is evident\r\nthat when great masses consolidate from a state of fusion, they may\r\nseparate into natural divisions; for this is seen to be the case in\r\nmany lava-currents. We may also expect that the rocks in question will\r\noften be rent by earthquakes, since these are common in volcanic\r\nregions; and the fissures will be often injected with similar matter, so\r\nthat dikes of crystalline rock will traverse masses of similar\r\ncomposition. It is also clear, that no organic remains can be included\r\nin such masses, as also that these deep-seated igneous formations\r\nconsidered in mass must underlie all the strata containing organic\r\nremains, because the heat proceeds from below upwards, and the intensity\r\nrequired to reduce the mineral ingredients to a fluid state must destroy\r\nall organic bodies in rocks included in the midst of them.\r\n\r\nIf by a continued series of elevatory movements, such masses shall\r\nhereafter be brought up to the surface, in the same manner as\r\nsedimentary marine strata have, in the course of ages, been upheaved to\r\nthe summit of the loftiest mountains, it is not difficult to foresee\r\nwhat perplexing problems may be presented to the geologist. He may then,\r\nperhaps, study in some mountain-chain the very rocks produced at the\r\ndepth of several miles beneath the Andes, Iceland, or Java, in the time\r\nof Leibnitz, and draw from them the same conclusion which that\r\nphilosopher derived from certain igneous products of high antiquity; for\r\nhe conceived our globe to have been, for an indefinite period, in the\r\nstate of a comet, without an ocean, and uninhabitable alike by aquatic\r\nor terrestrial animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES AND THEIR EFFECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Earthquakes and their effects--Deficiency of ancient\r\n    accounts--Ordinary atmospheric phenomena--Changes produced by\r\n    earthquakes in modern times considered in chronological\r\n    order--Earthquake in Syria, 1837--Earthquakes in Chili in 1837 and\r\n    1835--Isle of Santa Maria raised ten feet--Chili, 1822--Extent of\r\n    country elevated--Aleppo and Ionian Isles--Earthquake of Cutch in\r\n    1819--Subsidence in the Delta of the Indus--Island of Sumbawa in\r\n    1815--Earthquake of Caraccas in 1812--Shocks at New Madrid in 1811\r\n    in the valley of the Mississippi--Aleutian Islands in\r\n    1806--Reflections on the earthquakes of the nineteenth\r\n    century--Earthquake in Quito, Quebec, &c.--Java, 1786--Sinking down\r\n    of large tracts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the sketch before given of the geographical boundaries of volcanic\r\nregions, I stated, that although the points of eruption are but thinly\r\nscattered, constituting mere spots on the surface of those vast\r\ndistricts, yet the subterranean movements extend simultaneously over\r\nimmense areas. We may now proceed to consider the changes which these\r\nmovements produce on the surface, and in the internal structure of the\r\nearth's crust.\r\n\r\n_Deficiency of ancient accounts._--It is only within the last century\r\nand a half, since Hooke first promulgated, in 1688, his views respecting\r\nthe connection between geological phenomena and earthquakes, that the\r\npermanent changes affected by these convulsions have excited attention.\r\nBefore that time, the narrative of the historian was almost exclusively\r\nconfined to the number of human beings who perished, the number of\r\ncities laid in ruins, the value of property destroyed, or certain\r\natmospheric appearances which dazzled or terrified the observers. The\r\ncreation of a new lake, the engulfing of a new city, or the raising of a\r\nnew island, are sometimes, it is true, adverted to, as being too\r\nobvious, or of too much geographical or political interest to be passed\r\nover in silence. But no researches were made expressly with a view of\r\nascertaining the amount of depression or elevation of the ground, or any\r\nparticular alterations in the relative position of sea and land; and\r\nvery little distinction was made between the raising of soil by volcanic\r\nejections, and the upheaving of it by forces acting from below. The same\r\nremark applies to a very large proportion of modern accounts: and how\r\nmuch reason we have to regret this deficiency of information appears\r\nfrom this, that in every instance where a spirit of scientific inquiry\r\nhas animated the eye-witnesses of these events, facts calculated to\r\nthrow light on former modifications of the earth's structure are\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\n_Phenomena attending earthquakes._--As I shall confine myself almost\r\nentirely, in the following notice of earthquakes, to the changes brought\r\nabout by them in the configuration of the earth's crust, I may mention,\r\ngenerally, some accompaniments of these terrible events which are almost\r\nuniformly commemorated in history, that it may be unnecessary to advert\r\nto them again. Irregularities in the seasons preceding or following the\r\nshocks; sudden gusts of wind, interrupted by dead calms; violent rains\r\nat unusual seasons, or in countries where such phenomena are almost\r\nunknown; a reddening of the sun's disk, and a haziness in the air, often\r\ncontinued for months; an evolution of electric matter, or of inflammable\r\ngas from the soil, with sulphurous and mephitic vapors; noises\r\nunderground, like the running of carriages, or the discharge of\r\nartillery, or distant thunder; animals uttering cries of distress, and\r\nevincing extraordinary alarm, being more sensitive than men of the\r\nslightest movement; a sensation like sea-sickness, and a dizziness in\r\nthe head, experienced by men:--these, and other phenomena, less\r\nconnected with our present subject as geologists, have recurred again\r\nand again at distant ages, and in all parts of the globe.\r\n\r\nI shall now begin the enumeration of earthquakes with the latest\r\nauthentic narratives, and so carry back the survey retrospectively, that\r\nI may bring before the reader, in the first place, the minute and\r\ncircumstantial details of modern times, and thus enable him, by\r\nobserving the extraordinary amount of change within the last 150 years,\r\nto perceive how great must be the deficiency in the meager annals of\r\nearlier eras.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.[622]\r\n\r\n_Syria_, January, 1837.--It has been remarked that earthquakes affect\r\nelongated areas. The violent shock which devastated Syria in 1837 was\r\nfelt on a line 500 miles in length by 90 in breadth:[623] more than 6000\r\npersons perished; deep rents were caused in solid rocks, and new hot\r\nsprings burst out at Tabereah.\r\n\r\n_Chili--Valdivia_, 1837.--One of the latest earthquakes by which the\r\nposition of solid land is known to have been permanently altered is that\r\nwhich occurred in Chili, on November 7th, 1837. On that day Valdivia was\r\ndestroyed by an earthquake, and a whaler, commanded by Captain Coste,\r\nwas violently shaken at sea, and lost her masts, in lat. 43 degrees 38\r\nminutes S. in sight of the land. The captain went on the 11th of\r\nDecember following to a spot near the island of Lemus, one of the Chonos\r\narchipelago, where he had anchored two years before, and found that the\r\nbottom of the sea had been raised more than eight feet. Some rocks\r\nformerly covered at all times by the sea were now constantly exposed,\r\nand an enormous quantity of shells and fish in a decaying state, which\r\nhad been thrown there by the waves, or suddenly laid dry during the\r\nearthquake, attested the recent date of the occurrence. The whole coast\r\nwas strewed with uprooted trees.[624]\r\n\r\n_Chili--Conception_, 1835.--Fortunately we have a still more detailed\r\naccount of the geographical changes produced in the same country on the\r\n20th of February, 1835. An earthquake was then felt at all places\r\nbetween Copiapo and Chiloe, from north to south, and from Mendoza to\r\nJuan Fernandez, from east to west. \"Vessels,\" says Mr. Caldcleugh,\r\n\"navigating the Pacific, within 100 miles of the coast, experienced the\r\nshock with considerable force.\"[625] Conception, Talcahuano, Chillan,\r\nand other towns were thrown down. From the account of Captain Fitz Roy,\r\nR. N., who was then employed in surveying the coast, we learn that after\r\nthe shock the sea retired in the Bay of Conception, and the vessels\r\ngrounded, even those which had been lying in seven fathoms water: all\r\nthe shoals were visible, and soon afterwards a wave rushed in and then\r\nretreated, and was followed by two other waves. The vertical height of\r\nthese waves does not appear to have been much greater than from sixteen\r\nto twenty feet, although they rose to much greater heights when they\r\nbroke upon a sloping beach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Caldcleugh and Mr. Darwin, the whole volcanic chain of\r\nthe Chilian Andes, a range 150 miles in length, was in a state of\r\nunusual activity, both during the shocks and for some time preceding and\r\nafter the convulsion, and lava was seen to flow from the crater of\r\nOsorno. (See Map, fig. 69.) The island of Juan Fernandez, distant 365\r\ngeographical miles from Chili, was violently shaken at the same time,\r\nand devastated by a great wave. A submarine volcano broke out there\r\nnear Bacalao Head, about a mile from the shore, in sixty-nine fathoms\r\nwater, and illumined the whole island during the night.[626]\r\n\r\n\"At Conception,\" says Captain Fitz Roy, \"the earth opened and closed\r\nrapidly in numerous places. The direction of the cracks was not uniform,\r\nthough generally from southeast to northwest. The earth was not quiet\r\nfor three days after the great shock, and more than 300 shocks were\r\ncounted between the 20th February and the 4th of March. The loose earth\r\nof the valley of the Biobio was everywhere parted from the solid rocks\r\nwhich bound the plain, there being an opening between them from an inch\r\nto a foot in width.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.]\r\n\r\n\"For some days after the 20th of February, the sea at Talcahuano,\" says\r\nCaptain Fitz Roy, \"did not rise to the usual marks by four or five feet\r\nvertically. When walking on the shore, even at high water, beds of dead\r\nmussels, numerous chitons, and limpets, and withered seaweed, still\r\nadhering, though lifeless, to the rocks on which they had lived,\r\neverywhere met the eye.\" But this difference in the relative level of\r\nthe land and sea gradually diminished, till in the middle of April the\r\nwater rose again to within two feet of the former high-water mark. It\r\nmight be supposed that these changes of level merely indicated a\r\ntemporary disturbance in the set of the currents or in the height of the\r\ntides at Talcahuano; but, on considering what occurred in the\r\nneighboring island of Santa Maria, Captain Fitz Roy concluded that the\r\nland had been raised four or five feet in February, and that it had\r\nreturned in April to within two or three feet of its former level.\r\n\r\nSanta Maria, the island just alluded to, is about seven miles long and\r\ntwo broad, and about twenty-five miles southwest of Conception. (See\r\nMap, fig. 70.) The phenomena observed there are most important. \"It\r\nappeared,\" says Captain Fitz Roy, who visited Santa Maria twice, the\r\nfirst time at the end of March, and afterwards in the beginning of\r\nApril, \"that the southern extremity of the island had been raised eight\r\nfeet, the middle nine, and the northern end upwards of ten feet. On\r\nsteep rocks, where vertical measures could be correctly taken, beds of\r\ndead mussels were found ten feet above high-water mark. One foot lower\r\nthan the highest bed of mussels, a few limpets and chitons were seen\r\nadhering to the rock where they had grown. Two feet lower than the same,\r\ndead mussels, chitons, and limpets were abundant.\r\n\r\n\"An extensive rocky flat lies around the northern parts of Santa Maria.\r\nBefore the earthquake this flat was covered by the sea, some projecting\r\nrocks only showing themselves. Now, the whole flat is exposed, and\r\nsquare acres of it are covered with dead shell-fish, the stench arising\r\nfrom which is abominable. By this elevation of the land the southern\r\nport of Santa Maria has been almost destroyed; little shelter remaining\r\nthere, and very bad landing.\" The surrounding sea is also stated to have\r\nbecome shallower in exactly the same proportion as the land had risen;\r\nthe soundings having diminished a fathom and a half everywhere around\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nAt Tubal, also, to the southeast of Santa Maria, the land was raised six\r\nfeet, at Mocha two feet, but no elevation could be ascertained at\r\nValdivia.\r\n\r\nAmong other effects of the catastrophe, it is stated that cattle\r\nstanding on a steep slope, near the shore, were rolled down into the\r\nsea, and many others were washed off by the great wave from low land and\r\ndrowned.[627]\r\n\r\nIn November of the same year (1835), Conception was shaken by a severe\r\nearthquake, and on the same day Osorno, at the distance of 400 miles,\r\nrenewed its activity. These facts prove not only the connection of\r\nearthquakes with volcanic eruptions in this region, but also the vast\r\nextent of the subterranean areas over which the disturbing cause acts\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\n_Ischia_, 1828.--On the 2d of February the whole island of Ischia was\r\nshaken by an earthquake, and in the October following I found all the\r\nhouses in Casamicciol still without their roofs. On the sides of a\r\nravine between that town and Forio, I saw masses of greenish tuff which\r\nhad been thrown down. The hot-spring of Rita, which was nearest the\r\ncentre of the movement, was ascertained by M. Covelli to have increased\r\nin temperature, showing, as he observes, that the explosion took place\r\nbelow the reservoirs which heat the thermal waters.[628]\r\n\r\n_Bogota_, 1827.--On the 16th of November, 1827, the plain of Bogota, in\r\nNew Granada, or Colombia, was convulsed by an earthquake, and a great\r\nnumber of towns were thrown down. Torrents of rain swelled the\r\nMagdalena, sweeping along vast quantities of mud and other substances,\r\nwhich emitted a sulphurous vapor and destroyed the fish. Popayan, which\r\nis distant 200 geographical miles S. S. W. of Bogota, suffered greatly.\r\nWide crevices appeared in the road of Guanacas, leaving no doubt that\r\nthe whole of the Cordilleras sustained a powerful shock. Other fissures\r\nopened near Costa, in the plains of Bogota, into which the river Tunza\r\nimmediately began to flow.[629] It is worthy of remark, that in all such\r\ncases the ancient gravel bed of a river is deserted and a new one formed\r\nat a lower level; so that a want of relation in the position of alluvial\r\nbeds of the existing water-courses may be no test of the high antiquity\r\nof such deposits, at least in countries habitually convulsed by\r\nearthquakes. Extraordinary rains accompanied the shocks before\r\nmentioned; and two volcanoes are said to have been in eruption in the\r\nmountain-chain nearest to Bogota.\r\n\r\n_Chili_, 1822.--On the 19th of November, 1822, the coast of Chili was\r\nvisited by a most destructive earthquake. The shock was felt\r\nsimultaneously throughout a space of 1200 miles from north to south. St.\r\nJago, Valparaiso, and some other places, were greatly injured. When the\r\ndistrict round Valparaiso was examined on the morning after the shock,\r\nit was found that the coast for a considerable distance was raised above\r\nits former level.[630] At Valparaiso the elevation was three feet, and\r\nat Quintero about four feet. Part of the bed of the sea, says Mrs.\r\nGraham, remained bare and dry at high water, \"with beds of oysters,\r\nmussels, and other shells adhering to the rocks on which they grew, the\r\nfish being all dead, and exhaling most offensive effluvia.[631]\r\n\r\nAn old wreck of a ship, which before could not be approached, became\r\naccessible from the land, although its distance from the original\r\nsea-shore had not altered. It was observed that the water-course of a\r\nmill, at the distance of about a mile from the sea, gained a fall of\r\nfourteen inches, in little more than one hundred yards; and from this\r\nfact it is inferred that the rise in some parts of the inland country\r\nwas far more considerable than on the borders of the ocean.[632] Part of\r\nthe coast thus elevated consisted of granite, in which parallel fissures\r\nwere caused, some of which were traced for a mile and a half inland.\r\nCones of earth about four feet high were thrown up in several districts,\r\nby the forcing up of water mixed with sand through funnel-shaped\r\nhollows,--a phenomenon very common in Calabria, and the explanation of\r\nwhich will hereafter be considered. Those houses in Chili of which the\r\nfoundations were on rock were less damaged than such as were built on\r\nalluvial soil.\r\n\r\nMr. Cruickshanks, an English botanist, who resided in the country\r\nduring the earthquake, has informed me that some rocks of greenstone at\r\nQuintero, a few hundred yards from the beach, which had always been\r\nunder water till the shock of 1822, have since been uncovered when the\r\ntide is at half-ebb: and he states that, after the earthquake, it was\r\nthe general belief of the fishermen and inhabitants of the Chilian\r\ncoast, _not_ that the land had risen, but that the ocean had permanently\r\nretreated.\r\n\r\nDr. Meyen, a Prussian traveller, who visited Valparaiso in 1831, says\r\nthat on examining the rocks both north and south of the town, nine years\r\nafter the event, he found, in corroboration of Mrs. Graham's account,\r\nthat remains of animals and sea-weed, the _Lessonia_ of Bory de St.\r\nVincent, which has a firm ligneous stem, still adhered to those rocks\r\nwhich in 1822 had been elevated above high-water mark.[633] According to\r\nthe same author, the whole coast of Central Chili was raised about four\r\nfeet, and banks of marine shells were laid dry on many parts of the\r\ncoast. He observed similar banks, elevated at unknown periods, in\r\nseveral places, especially at Copiapo, where the species all agree with\r\nthose now living in the ocean. Mr. Freyer also, who resided some years\r\nin South America, has confirmed these statements;[634] and Mr. Darwin\r\nobtained evidence that the remains of an ancient wall, formerly washed\r\nby the sea, and now 11-1/2 feet above high-water mark, acquired several\r\nfeet of this additional elevation during the earthquake of 1822.[635]\r\n\r\nThe shocks continued up to the end of September, 1823; even then,\r\nforty-eight hours seldom passed without one, and sometimes two or three\r\nwere felt during twenty-four hours. Mrs. Graham observed, after the\r\nearthquake of 1822, that besides a beach newly raised above high-water\r\nmark, there were several older elevated lines of beach, one above the\r\nother, consisting of shingle mixed with shells extending in a parallel\r\ndirection to the shore, to the height of fifty feet above the sea.[636]\r\n\r\n_Extent of country elevated._--By some observers it has been supposed\r\nthat the whole country from the foot of the Andes to a great distance\r\nunder the sea was upraised in 1822, the greatest rise being at the\r\ndistance of about two miles from the shore. \"The rise upon the coast was\r\nfrom two to four feet:--at the distance of a mile inland it must have\r\nbeen from five to six or seven feet.\"[637] It has also been conjectured\r\nby the same eye-witnesses to the convulsion, that the area over which\r\nthis permanent alteration of level extended may have been equal to\r\n100,000 square miles. Although the increased fall of certain\r\nwater-courses may have afforded some ground for this conjecture, it must\r\nbe considered as very hypothetical, and the estimate may have exceeded\r\nor greatly fallen short of the truth. It may nevertheless be useful to\r\nreflect on the enormous amount of change which this single convulsion\r\noccasioned, if the extent of country moved upward really amounted to\r\n100,000 square miles,--an extent just equal to half the area of France,\r\nor about five-sixths of the area of Great Britain and Ireland. If we\r\nsuppose the elevation to have been only three feet on an average, it\r\nwill be seen that the mass of rock added to the continent of America by\r\nthe movement, or, in other words, the mass previously below the level of\r\nthe sea, and after the shocks permanently above it, must have contained\r\nfifty-seven cubic miles in bulk; which would be sufficient to form a\r\nconical mountain two miles high (or about as high as Etna), with a\r\ncircumference at the base of nearly thirty-three miles. We may take the\r\nmean specific gravity of the rock at 2.655,--a fair average, and a\r\nconvenient one in such computations, because at such a rate a cubic yard\r\nweighs two tons. Then, assuming the great pyramid of Egypt, if solid, to\r\nweigh, in accordance with an estimate before given, six million tons, we\r\nmay state the rock added to the continent by the Chilian earthquake to\r\nhave more than equalled 100,000 pyramids.\r\n\r\nBut it must always be borne in mind that the weight of rock here alluded\r\nto constituted but an insignificant part of the whole amount which the\r\nvolcanic forces had to overcome. The whole thickness of rock between the\r\nsurface of Chili and the subterranean foci of volcanic action may be\r\nmany miles or leagues deep. Say that the thickness was only two miles,\r\neven then the mass which changed place and rose three feet being 200,000\r\ncubic miles in volume, must have exceeded in weight 363 million\r\npyramids.\r\n\r\nIt may be instructing to consider these results in connection with\r\nothers already obtained from a different source, and to compare the\r\nworking of two antagonistic forces--the levelling power of running\r\nwater, and the expansive energy of subterranean heat. How long, it may\r\nbe asked, would the Ganges require, according to data before explained\r\n(p. 283), to transport to the sea a quantity of solid matter equal to\r\nthat which may have been added to the land by the Chilian earthquake?\r\nThe discharge of mud in one year by the Ganges was estimated at 20,000\r\nmillion cubic feet. According to that estimate it would require about\r\nfour centuries (or 418 years) before the river could bear down from the\r\ncontinent into the sea a mass equal to that gained by the Chilian\r\nearthquake. In about half that time, perhaps, the united waters of the\r\nGanges and Burrampooter might accomplish the operation.\r\n\r\n_Cutch_, 1819.--A violent earthquake occurred at Cutch, in the delta of\r\nthe Indus, on the 16th of June, 1819. (See Map, fig. 71.) The principal\r\ntown, Bhooj, was converted into a heap of ruins, and its stone buildings\r\nwere thrown down. The movement was felt over an area having a radius of\r\n1000 miles from Bhooj, and extending to Kbatmandoo, Calcutta, and\r\nPondicherry.[638] The vibrations were felt in Northwest India, at a\r\ndistance of 800 miles, after an interval of about fifteen minutes after\r\nthe earthquake at Bhooj. At Ahmedabad the great mosque, erected by\r\nSultan Ahmed nearly 450 years before, fell to the ground, attesting how\r\nlong a period had elapsed since a shock of similar violence had visited\r\nthat point. At Anjar, the fort, with its tower and guns, was hurled to\r\nthe ground in one common mass of ruin. The shocks continued until the\r\n20th; when, thirty miles northwest from Bhooj, the volcano called\r\nDenodur is said by some to have sent forth flames, but Capt. Grant was\r\nunable to authenticate this statement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71. MAP of THE COUNTRIES at THE MOUTH OF THE\r\nINDUS.]\r\n\r\n_Subsidence in the delta of the Indus._--Although the ruin of towns was\r\ngreat, the face of nature in the inland country, says Captain Macmurdo,\r\nwas not visibly altered. In the hills some large masses only of rock and\r\nsoil were detached from the precipices; but the eastern and almost\r\ndeserted channel of the Indus, which bounds the province of Cutch, was\r\ngreatly changed. This estuary, or inlet of the sea, was, before the\r\nearthquake, fordable at Luckput, being only about a foot deep when the\r\ntide was at ebb, and at flood-tide never more than six feet; but it was\r\ndeepened at the fort of Luckput, after the shock, to more than _eighteen\r\nfeet at low water_.[639] On sounding other parts of the channel, it was\r\nfound, that where previously the depth of the water at flood never\r\nexceeded one or two feet, it had become from four to ten feet deep. By\r\nthese and other remarkable changes of level, a part of the inland\r\nnavigation of that country, which had been closed for centuries, became\r\nagain practicable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.\r\n\r\nFort of Sindree, on the eastern branch of the Indus, before it was\r\nsubmerged by the earthquake of 1819, from a sketch of Capt. Grindlay,\r\nmade in 1808.]\r\n\r\n_Fort and village submerged._[640]--The fort and village of Sindree, on\r\nthe eastern arm of the Indus, above Luckput, are stated by the same\r\nwriter to have been overflowed; and, after the shock, the tops of the\r\nhouses and wall were alone to be seen above the water, for the houses,\r\nalthough submerged, were not cast down. Had they been situated,\r\ntherefore, in the interior, where so many forts were levelled to the\r\nground, their site would, perhaps, have been regarded as having remained\r\ncomparatively unmoved. Hence we may suspect that great permanent\r\nupheavings and depressions of soil may be the result of earthquakes,\r\nwithout the inhabitants being in the least degree conscious of any\r\nchange of level.\r\n\r\nA more recent survey of Cutch, by Sir A. Burnes, who was not in\r\ncommunication with Capt. Macmurdo, confirms the facts above enumerated,\r\nand adds many important details.[641] That officer examined the delta of\r\nthe Indus in 1826 and 1828, and from his account it appears that, when\r\nSindree subsided in June, 1819, the sea flowed in by the eastern mouth\r\nof the Indus, and in a few hours converted a tract of land, 2000 square\r\nmiles in area, into an inland sea, or lagoon. Neither the rush of the\r\nsea into this new depression, nor the movement of the earthquake, threw\r\ndown entirely the small fort of Sindree, one of the four towers, the\r\nnorthwestern, still continuing to stand; and, the day after the\r\nearthquake, the inhabitants who had ascended to the top of this tower,\r\nsaved themselves in boats.[642]\r\n\r\n_Elevation of the Ullah Bund._--Immediately after the shock, the\r\ninhabitants of Sindree saw, at the distance of five miles and a half\r\nfrom their village, a long elevated mound, where previously there had\r\nbeen a low and perfectly level plain. (See Map, fig. 71.) To this\r\nuplifted tract they gave the name of \"Ullah Bund,\" or the \"Mound of\r\nGod,\" to distinguish it from several artificial dams previously thrown\r\nacross the eastern arm of the Indus.\r\n\r\n_Extent of country raised._--It has been ascertained that this\r\nnew-raised country is _upwards of fifty miles_ in length from east to\r\nwest, running parallel to that line of subsidence before mentioned,\r\nwhich caused the grounds around Sindree to be flooded. The range of this\r\nelevation extends from Puchum Island towards Gharee; its breadth from\r\nnorth to south is conjectured to be in some parts _sixteen miles_, and\r\nits greatest ascertained height above the original level of the delta is\r\nten feet,--an elevation which appears to the eye to be very uniform\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\nFor several years after the convulsion of 1819, the course of the Indus\r\nwas very unsettled, and at length, in 1826, the river threw a vast body\r\nof water into its eastern arm, that called the Phurraun, above Sindree;\r\nand forcing its way in a more direct course to the sea, burst through\r\nall the artificial dams which had been thrown across its channel, and at\r\nlength cut right through the \"Ullah Bund,\" whereby a natural section was\r\nobtained. In the perpendicular cliffs thus laid open Sir A. Burnes found\r\nthat the upraised lands consisted of clay filled with shells. The new\r\nchannel of the river where it intersected the \"bund\" was eighteen feet\r\ndeep, and forty yards in width; but in 1828 the channel was still\r\nfarther enlarged. The Indus, when it first opened this new passage,\r\nthrew such a body of water into the new mere, or salt lagoon, of\r\nSindree, that it became fresh for many months; but it had recovered its\r\nsaltness in 1828, when the supply of river-water was less copious, and\r\nfinally it became more salt than the sea, in consequence, as the natives\r\nsuggested to Sir A. Burnes, of the saline particles with which the \"Runn\r\nof Cutch\" is impregnated.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 Sir A. Burnes went in a boat to the ruins of Sindree, where a\r\nsingle remaining tower was seen in the midst of a wide expanse of sea.\r\nThe tops of the ruined walls still rose two or three feet above the\r\nlevel of the water; and standing on one of these, he could behold\r\nnothing in the horizon but water, except in one direction, where a blue\r\nstreak of land to the north indicated the Ullah Bund. This scene\r\npresents to the imagination a lively picture of the revolutions now in\r\nprogress on the earth--a waste of waters where a few years before all\r\nwas land, and the only land visible consisting of ground uplifted by a\r\nrecent earthquake.\r\n\r\nTen years after the visit of Sir A. Burnes above alluded to, my friend,\r\nCaptain Grant, F. G. S., of the Bombay Engineers, had the kindness to\r\nsend at my request a native surveyor to make a plan of Sindree and Ullah\r\nBund, in March, 1838. From his description it appears that, at that\r\nseason, the driest of the whole year, he found the channel traversing\r\nthe Bund to be 100 yards wide, without water, and incrusted with salt.\r\nHe was told that it has now only four or five feet of water in it after\r\nrains. The sides or banks were nearly perpendicular, and nine feet in\r\nheight. The lagoon has diminished both in area and depth, and part near\r\nthe fort was dry land. The annexed drawing, made by Captain Grant from\r\nthe surveyor's plan, shows the appearance of the fort in the midst of\r\nthe lake, as seen in 1838 from the west, or from the same point as that\r\nfrom which Captain Grindlay's sketch (see fig. 72) was taken in 1808,\r\nbefore the earthquake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.\r\n\r\nView of the Fort of Sindree, from the west, in March, 1838.]\r\n\r\nThe Runn of Cutch is a flat region of a very peculiar character, and no\r\nless than 7000 square miles in area: a greater superficial extent than\r\nYorkshire, or about one-fourth the area of Ireland. It is not a desert\r\nof moving sand, nor a marsh, but evidently the dried-up bed of an inland\r\nsea, which for a great part of every year has a hard and dry bottom\r\nuncovered by weeds or grass, and only supporting here and there a few\r\ntamarisks. But during the monsoons, when the sea runs high, the\r\nsalt-water driven up from the Gulf of Cutch and the creeks at Luckput\r\noverflows a large part of the Runn, especially after rains, when the\r\nsoaked ground permits the sea-water to spread rapidly. The Runn is also\r\nliable to be overflowed occasionally in some parts by river-water: and\r\nit is remarkable that the only portion which was ever highly cultivated\r\n(that anciently called Sayra) is now permanently submerged. The surface\r\nof the Runn is sometimes incrusted with salt about an inch in depth, in\r\nconsequence of the evaporation of the sea-water. Islands rise up in some\r\nparts of the waste, and the boundary lands form bays and promontories.\r\nThe natives have various traditions respecting the former separation of\r\nCutch and Sinde by a bay of the sea, and the drying up of the district\r\ncalled the Runn. But these tales, besides the usual uncertainty of oral\r\ntradition, are farther obscured by mythological fictions. The conversion\r\nof the Runn into land is chiefly ascribed to the miraculous powers of a\r\nHindoo saint, by name Damorath (or Dhoorunnath), who had previously done\r\npenance for twelve years on the summit of Denodur hill. Captain Grant\r\ninfers, on various grounds, that this saint flourished about the\r\neleventh or twelfth century of our era. In proof of the drying up of\r\nthe Runn, some towns far inland are still pointed out as having once\r\nbeen ancient ports. It has, moreover, been always said that ships were\r\nwrecked and engulphed by the great catastrophe; and in the jets of black\r\nmuddy water thrown out of fissures in that region, in 1819, there were\r\ncast up numerous pieces of wrought-iron and ship nails.[643] Cones of\r\nsand six or eight feet in height were at the same time thrown up on\r\nthese lands.[644]\r\n\r\nWe must not conclude without alluding to a _moral_ phenomenon connected\r\nwith this tremendous catastrophe, which we regard as highly deserving\r\nthe attention of geologists. It is stated by Sir A. Burnes, that \"these\r\nwonderful events passed _unheeded_ by the inhabitants of Cutch;\" for the\r\nregion convulsed, though once fertile, had for a long period been\r\nreduced to sterility by want of irrigation, so that the natives were\r\nindifferent as to its fate. Now it is to this profound apathy which all\r\nbut highly civilized nations feel, in regard to physical events not\r\nhaving an immediate influence on their worldly fortunes, that we must\r\nascribe the extraordinary dearth of historical information concerning\r\nchanges of the earth's surface, which modern observations show to be by\r\nno means of rare occurrence in the ordinary course of nature.\r\n\r\nSince the above account was written, a description has been published of\r\nmore recent geographical changes in the district of Cutch, near the\r\nmouth of the Koree, or eastern branch of the Indus, which happened in\r\nJune, 1845. A large area seems to have subsided, and the Sindree lake\r\nhad become a salt marsh.[645]\r\n\r\n_Island of Sumbawa_, 1815.--In April, 1815, one of the most frightful\r\neruptions recorded in history occurred in the province of Tomboro, in\r\nthe island of Sumbawa (see Map, fig. 39, p. 351), about 200 miles from\r\nthe eastern extremity of Java. In April of the year preceding the\r\nvolcano had been observed in a state of considerable activity, ashes\r\nhaving fallen upon the decks of vessels which sailed past the\r\ncoast.[646] The eruption of 1815 began on the 5th of April, but was most\r\nviolent on the 11th and 12th, and did not entirely cease till July. The\r\nsound of the explosions was heard in Sumatra, at the distance of 970\r\ngeographical miles in a direct line; and at Ternate, in an opposite\r\ndirection, at the distance of 720 miles. Out of a population of 12,000,\r\nin the province of Tomboro, only twenty-six individuals survived.\r\nViolent whirlwinds carried up men, horses, cattle, and whatever else\r\ncame within their influence into the air; tore up the largest trees by\r\nthe roots, and covered the whole sea with floating timber.[647] Great\r\ntracts of land were covered by lava, several streams of which, issuing\r\nfrom the crater of the Tomboro mountain, reached the sea: So heavy was\r\nthe fall of ashes, that they broke into the Resident's house at Bima,\r\nforty miles east of the volcano, and rendered it as well as many other\r\ndwellings in the town uninhabitable. On the side of Java the ashes were\r\ncarried to the distance of 300 miles, and 217 towards Celebes, in\r\nsufficient quantity to darken the air. The floating cinders to the\r\nwestward of Sumatra formed, on the 12th of April, a mass two feet thick,\r\nand several miles in extent, through which ships with difficulty forced\r\ntheir way.\r\n\r\nThe darkness occasioned in the daytime by the ashes in Java was so\r\nprofound, that nothing equal to it was ever witnessed in the darkest\r\nnight. Although this volcanic dust when it fell was an impalpable\r\npowder, it was of considerable weight when compressed, a pint of it\r\nweighing twelve ounces and three quarters. \"Some of the finest\r\nparticles,\" says Mr. Crawfurd, \"were transported to the islands of\r\nAmboyna and Banda, which last is about 800 miles east from the site of\r\nthe volcano, although the southeast monsoon was then at its height.\"\r\nThey must have been projected, therefore, into the upper regions of the\r\natmosphere, where a counter-current prevailed.\r\n\r\nAlong the sea-coast of Sumbawa and the adjacent isles, the sea rose\r\nsuddenly to the height of from two to twelve feet, a great wave rushing\r\nup the estuaries, and then suddenly subsiding. Although the wind at Bima\r\nwas still during the whole time, the sea rolled in upon the shore, and\r\nfilled the lower parts of the houses with water a foot deep. Every prow\r\nand boat was forced from the anchorage, and driven on shore.\r\n\r\nThe town called Tomboro, on the west side of Sumbawa, was overflowed by\r\nthe sea, which encroached upon the shore so that the water remained\r\npermanently eighteen feet deep in places where there was land before.\r\nHere we may observe, that the amount of subsidence of land was apparent,\r\nin spite of the ashes, which would naturally have caused the limits of\r\nthe coast to be extended.\r\n\r\nThe area over which tremulous noises and other volcanic effects\r\nextended, was 1000 English miles in circumference, including the whole\r\nof the Molucca Islands, Java, a considerable portion of Celebes,\r\nSumatra, and Borneo. In the island of Amboyna, in the same month and\r\nyear, the ground opened, threw out water, and then closed again.[648]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I may remind the reader, that but for the accidental\r\npresence of Sir Stamford Raffles, then Governor of Java, we should\r\nscarcely have heard in Europe of this tremendous catastrophe. He\r\nrequired all the residents in the various districts under his authority\r\nto send in a statement of the circumstances which occurred within their\r\nown knowledge; but, valuable as were their communications, they are\r\noften calculated to excite rather than to satisfy the curiosity of the\r\ngeologist. They mention that similar effects, though in a less degree,\r\nhad, about seven years before, accompanied an eruption of Carang Assam,\r\na volcano in the island of Bali, west of Sumatra; but no particulars of\r\nthat great catastrophe are recorded.[649]\r\n\r\n_Caraccas_, 1812.--On the 26th of March, 1812, several violent shocks of\r\nan earthquake were felt in Caraccas. The surface undulated like a\r\nboiling liquid, and terrific sounds were heard underground. The whole\r\ncity with its splendid churches was in an instant a heap of ruins,\r\nunder which 10,000 of the inhabitants were buried. On the 5th of April,\r\nenormous rocks were detached from the mountains. It was believed that\r\nthe mountain Silla lost from 300 to 360 feet of its height by\r\nsubsidence; but this was an opinion not founded on any measurement. On\r\nthe 27th of April, a volcano in St. Vincent's threw out ashes; and, on\r\nthe 30th, lava flowed from its crater into the sea, while its explosions\r\nwere heard at a distance equal to that between Vesuvius and Switzerland,\r\nthe sound being transmitted, as Humboldt supposes, through the ground.\r\nDuring the earthquake which destroyed Caraccas, an immense quantity of\r\nwater was thrown out at Valecillo, near Valencia, as also at Porto\r\nCabello, through openings in the earth; and in the Lake Maracaybo the\r\nwater sank. Humboldt observed that the Cordilleras, composed of gneiss\r\nand mica slate, and the country immediately at their feet, were more\r\nviolently shaken than the plains.[650]\r\n\r\n_South Carolina and New Madrid, Missouri_, 1811-12.--Previous to the\r\ndestruction of La Guayra and Caraccas, in 1812, earthquakes were felt in\r\nSouth Carolina; and the shocks continued till those cities were\r\ndestroyed. The valley also of the Mississippi, from the village of New\r\nMadrid to the mouth of the Ohio in one direction, and to the St. Francis\r\nin another, was convulsed in such a degree as to create new lakes and\r\nislands. It has been remarked by Humboldt in his Cosmos, that the\r\nearthquake of New Madrid presents one of the few examples on record of\r\nthe incessant quaking of the ground for several successive months _far\r\nfrom any volcano_. Flint, the geographer, who visited the country seven\r\nyears after the event, informs us, that a tract of many miles in extent,\r\nnear the Little Prairie, became covered with water three or four feet\r\ndeep; and when the water disappeared a stratum of sand was left in its\r\nplace. Large lakes of twenty miles in extent were formed in the course\r\nof an hour, and others were drained. The grave-yard at New Madrid was\r\nprecipitated into the bed of the Mississippi; and it is stated that the\r\nground whereon the town is built, and the river-bank for fifteen miles\r\nabove, sank eight feet below their former level.[651] The neighboring\r\nforest presented for some years afterwards \"a singular scene of\r\nconfusion; the trees standing inclined in every direction, and many\r\nhaving their trunks and branches broken.\"[652]\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants relate that the earth rose in great undulations; and\r\nwhen these reached a certain fearful height, the soil burst, and vast\r\nvolumes of water, sand, and pit-coal were discharged as high as the tops\r\nof the trees. Flint saw hundreds of these deep chasms remaining in an\r\nalluvial soil, seven years after. The people in the country, although\r\ninexperienced in such convulsions, had remarked that the chasms in the\r\nearth were in a direction from S. W. to N. E.; and they accordingly\r\nfelled the tallest trees, and laying them at right angles to the chasms,\r\nstationed themselves upon them. By this invention, when chasms opened\r\nmore than once under these trees, several persons were prevented from\r\nbeing swallowed up.[653] At one period during this earthquake, the\r\nground not far below New Madrid swelled up so as to arrest the\r\nMississippi in its course, and to cause a temporary reflux of its waves.\r\nThe motion of some of the shocks is described as having been horizontal,\r\nand of others perpendicular; and the vertical movement is said to have\r\nbeen much less desolating than the horizontal.\r\n\r\nThe above account has been reprinted exactly as it appeared in former\r\neditions of this work, compiled from the authorities which I have cited;\r\nbut having more recently (March, 1846) had an opportunity myself of\r\nvisiting the disturbed region of the Mississippi, and conversing with\r\nmany eye-witnesses of the catastrophe, I am able to confirm the truth of\r\nthose statements, and to add some remarks on the present face and\r\nfeatures of the country. I skirted, as was before related (p. 270), part\r\nof the territory immediately west of New Madrid, called \"the sunk\r\ncountry,\" which was for the first time permanently submerged during the\r\nearthquake of 1811-12. It is said to extend along the course of the\r\nWhite Water and its tributaries for a distance of between 70 and 80\r\nmiles north and south, and 30 miles east and west. I saw on its borders\r\nmany full-grown trees still standing leafless, the bottoms of their\r\ntrunks several feet under water, and a still greater number lying\r\nprostrate. An active vegetation of aquatic plants is already beginning\r\nto fill up some of the shallows, and the sediment washed in by\r\noccasional floods when the Mississippi rises to an extraordinary height\r\ncontributes to convert the sunk region into marsh and forest land. Even\r\non the dry ground along the confines of the submerged area, I observed\r\nin some places that all the trees of prior date to 1811 were dead and\r\nleafless, though standing erect and entire. They are supposed to have\r\nbeen killed by the loosening of their roots during the repeated\r\nundulations which passed through the ground for three months in\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nMr. Bringier, an experienced engineer of New Orleans, who was on\r\nhorseback near New Madrid when some of the severest shocks were\r\nexperienced, related to me (in 1846), that \"as the waves advanced the\r\ntrees bent down, and the instant afterwards, while recovering their\r\nposition, they often met those of other trees similarly inclined, so\r\nthat their branches becoming interlocked, they were prevented from\r\nrighting themselves again. The transit of the wave through the woods was\r\nmarked by the crashing noise of countless boughs, first heard on one\r\nside and then on the other. At the same time powerful jets of water,\r\nmixed with sand, mud, and fragments of coaly matter, were cast up,\r\nendangering the lives of both horse and rider.\"\r\n\r\nI was curious, to ascertain whether any vestiges still remained of these\r\nfountains of mud and water, and carefully examined between New Madrid\r\nand the Little Prairie several \"sink holes,\" as they are termed. They\r\nconsist of cavities from 10 to 30 yards in width, and 20 feet or more in\r\ndepth, and are very conspicuous, interrupting the level surface of a\r\nflat alluvial plain. I saw abundance of sand, which some of the present\r\ninhabitants saw spouting from these deep holes, also fragments of\r\ndecayed wood and black bituminous shale, probably drifted down at some\r\nformer period in the main channel of the Mississippi, from the\r\ncoal-fields farther north. I also found numerous rents in the soil left\r\nby the earthquake, some of them still several feet wide, and a yard or\r\ntwo in depth, although the action of rains, frost, and occasional\r\ninundations, and especially the leaves of trees blown into them in\r\ncountless numbers every autumn, have done much to fill them up. I\r\nmeasured the direction of some of the fissures, which usually varied\r\nfrom 10 to 45 degrees W. of north, and were often parallel to each\r\nother; I found, however, a considerable diversity in their direction.\r\nMany of them are traceable for half a mile and upwards, but they might\r\neasily be mistaken for artificial trenches if resident settlers were not\r\nthere to assure us that within their recollection they were \"as deep as\r\nwells.\" Fragments of coaly shale were strewed along the edges of some of\r\nthese open fissures, together with white sand, in the same manner as\r\nround the \"sink holes.\"[654]\r\n\r\nAmong other monuments of the changes wrought in 1811-12, I explored the\r\nbed of the lake called Eulalie, near New Madrid, 300 yards long by 100\r\nyards in width, which was suddenly drained during the earthquake. The\r\nparallel fissures by which the waters escaped are not yet entirely\r\nclosed, and all the trees growing on its bottom were at the time of my\r\nvisit less than 34 years old. They consisted of cotton-wood, willows,\r\nand honey-locust, and other species, differing from those clothing the\r\nsurrounding higher grounds, which are more elevated by 12 or 15 feet. On\r\nthem the hickory, the black and white oak, the gum and other trees, many\r\nof them of ancient date, were flourishing.\r\n\r\n_Aleutian Islands_, 1806.--In the year 1806, a new island, in the form\r\nof a peak, with some low conical hills upon it, is said to have risen\r\nfrom the sea among the Aleutian Islands, east of Kamtschatka. According\r\nto Langsdorf,[655] it was four geographical miles in circumference; and\r\nVon Buch infers from its magnitude, and from its not having again\r\nsubsided below the level of the sea, that it did not consist merely of\r\nejected matter, but of a solid rock of trachyte upheaved.[656] Another\r\nextraordinary eruption happened in the spring of the year 1814, in the\r\nsea near Unalaschka, in the same archipelago. A new isle was then\r\nproduced of considerable size, and with a peak three thousand feet high,\r\nwhich remained standing for a year afterwards, though with somewhat\r\ndiminished height.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is not improbable that earthquakes accompanying these\r\ntremendous eruptions may have heaved up part of the bed of the sea, yet\r\nthe circumstance of the islands not having disappeared like Sabrina (see\r\np. 416), may have arisen from the emission of lava. If Jorullo, for\r\nexample, in 1759, had risen from a shallow sea to the height of 1600\r\nfeet, instead of attaining that elevation above the Mexican plateau, the\r\nmassive current of basaltic lava which poured out from its crater would\r\nhave enabled it to withstand, for a long period, the action of a\r\nturbulent sea.\r\n\r\n_Reflections on the earthquakes of the nineteenth century._--We are now\r\nabout to pass on to the events of the eighteenth century; but before we\r\nleave the consideration of those already enumerated, let us pause for a\r\nmoment, and reflect how many remarkable facts of geological interest are\r\nafforded by the earthquakes above described, though they constitute but\r\na small part of the convulsions even of the last forty years. New rocks\r\nhave risen from the waters; new hot springs have burst out, and the\r\ntemperature of others has been raised; the coast of Chili has been\r\nthrice permanently elevated; a considerable tract in the delta of the\r\nIndus has sunk down, and some of its shallow channels have become\r\nnavigable; an adjoining part of the same district, upwards of fifty\r\nmiles in length and sixteen in breadth, has been raised about ten feet\r\nabove its former level; part of the great plain of the Mississippi, for\r\na distance of eighty miles in length by thirty in breadth, has sunk down\r\nseveral feet; the town of Tomboro has been submerged, and twelve\r\nthousand of the inhabitants of Sumbawa have been destroyed. Yet, with a\r\nknowledge of these terrific catastrophes, witnessed during so brief a\r\nperiod by the present generation, will the geologist declare with\r\nperfect composure that the earth has at length settled into a state of\r\nrepose? Will he continue to assert that the changes of relative level of\r\nland and sea, so common in former ages of the world, have now ceased?\r\nIf, in the face of so many striking facts, he persists in maintaining\r\nthis favorite dogma, it is in vain to hope that, by accumulating the\r\nproofs of similar convulsions during a series of antecedent ages, we\r\nshall shake his tenacity of purpose:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Si fractus illabatur orbis\r\n  Impavidum ferient ruinae.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n_Quito_, 1797.--On the morning of February 4th, 1797, the volcano of\r\nTunguragua in Quito, and the surrounding district, for forty leagues\r\nfrom south to north, and twenty leagues from west to east, experienced\r\nan undulating movement, which lasted four minutes. The same shock was\r\nfelt over a tract of 170 leagues from south to north, from Piura to\r\nPopayan; and 140 from west to east, from the sea to the river Napo. In\r\nthe smaller district first mentioned, where the movement was more\r\nintense, every town was levelled to the ground; and Riobamba, Quero, and\r\nother places, were buried under masses detached from the mountains. At\r\nthe foot of Tunguragua the earth was rent open in several places; and\r\nstreams of water and fetid mud, called \"moya,\" poured out, overflowing\r\nand wasting every thing. In valleys 1000 feet broad, the water of these\r\nfloods reached to the height of 600 feet; and the mud deposit barred up\r\nthe course of the river, so as to form lakes, which in some places\r\ncontinued for more than eighty days. Flames and suffocating vapors\r\nescaped from the lake Quilotoa, and killed all the cattle on its shores.\r\nThe shocks continued all February and March; and on the 5th of April\r\nthey recurred with almost as much violence as at first. We are told that\r\nthe form of the surface in the district most shaken was entirely\r\naltered, but no exact measurements are given whereby we may estimate the\r\ndegree of elevation or subsidence.[657] Indeed it would be difficult,\r\nexcept in the immediate neighborhood of the sea, to obtain any certain\r\nstandard of comparison if the levels were really as much altered as the\r\nnarrations imply.\r\n\r\n_Cumana_, 1797.--In the same year, on the 14th of December, the small\r\nAntilles experienced subterranean movements, and four-fifths of the town\r\nof Cumana was shaken down by a vertical shock. The form of the shoal of\r\nMornerouge, at the mouth of the river Bourdones, was changed by an\r\nupheaving of the ground.[658]\r\n\r\n_Canada--Quebec_, 1791.--We learn from Captain Bayfield's memoirs, that\r\nearthquakes are very frequent on the shore of the estuary of the St.\r\nLawrence, of force sufficient at times to split walls and throw down\r\nchimneys. Such were the effects experienced in December, 1721, in St.\r\nPaul's Bay, about fifty miles N. E. from Quebec; and the inhabitants\r\nsay, that about every twenty-five years a violent earthquake returns,\r\nwhich lasts forty days. In the History of Canada, it is stated that, in\r\n1663, a tremendous convulsion lasted six months, extending from Quebec\r\nto Tadeausac,--a distance of about 130 miles. The ice on the river was\r\nbroken up, and many landslips caused.[659]\r\n\r\n_Caraccas_, 1790.--In the Caraccas, near where the Caura joins the\r\nOrinoco, between the towns San Pedro de Alcantara and San Francisco de\r\nAripao, an earthquake, on St. Matthew's day 1790, caused a sinking in of\r\nthe granitic soil, and left a lake 800 yards in diameter, and from\r\neighty to one hundred in depth. It was a portion of the forest of Aripao\r\nwhich subsided, and the trees remained green for several months under\r\nwater.[660]\r\n\r\n_Sicily_, 1790.--On the 18th of March in the same year, at S. Maria di\r\nNiscemi, some miles from Terranuova, near the south coast of Sicily, the\r\nground gradually sunk down for a circumference of three Italian miles,\r\nduring seven shocks; and, in one place, to the depth of thirty feet. It\r\ncontinued to subside to the end of the month. Several fissures sent\r\nforth sulphur, petroleum, steam, and hot water, and a stream of mud,\r\nwhich flowed for two hours, and covered a space sixty feet long and\r\nthirty broad. This happened far from both the ancient and modern\r\nvolcanic district, in a group of strata consisting chiefly of blue\r\nclay.[661]\r\n\r\n_Java_, 1786.--About the year 1786, an earthquake was felt at intervals,\r\nfor the period of four months, in the neighborhood of Batur, in Java,\r\nand an eruption followed. Various rents were formed, which emitted a\r\nsulphurous vapor; separate tracts sunk away, and were swallowed by the\r\nearth. Into one of these the rivulet Dotog entered, and afterwards\r\ncontinued to follow a subterraneous course. The village of Jampang was\r\nburied in the ground, with thirty-eight of its inhabitants, who had not\r\ntime to escape. We are indebted to Dr. Horsfield for having verified the\r\nabove-mentioned facts.[662]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKE IN CALABRIA, 1783.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Earthquake in Calabria, February 5, 1783--Shocks continued to the\r\n    end of the year 1786--Authorities--Area convulsed--Geological\r\n    structure of the district--Difficulty of ascertaining changes of\r\n    level--Subsidence of the quay at Messina--Movement in the stones of\r\n    two obelisks--Shift or fault in the Round Tower of\r\n    Terranuova--Opening and closing of fissures--Large edifices\r\n    engulfed--Dimensions of new caverns and fissures--Gradual closing in\r\n    of rents--Bounding of detached masses into the\r\n    air--Landslips--Buildings transported entire to great distances--New\r\n    lakes--Funnel-shaped hollows in alluvial plains--Currents of\r\n    mud--Fall of cliffs, and shore near Scilla inundated--State of\r\n    Stromboli and Etna during the shocks--How earthquakes contribute to\r\n    the formation of valleys--Concluding remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calabria_, 1783.--Of the numerous earthquakes which have occurred in\r\ndifferent parts of the globe, during the last 100 years, that of\r\nCalabria, in 1783, is almost the only one of which the geologist can be\r\nsaid to have such a circumstantial account as to enable him fully to\r\nappreciate the changes which this cause is capable of producing in the\r\nlapse of ages. The shocks began in February, 1783, and lasted for nearly\r\nfour years, to the end of 1786. Neither in duration, nor in violence,\r\nnor in the extent of territory moved, was this convulsion remarkable,\r\nwhen contrasted with many experienced in other countries, both during\r\nthe last and present century; nor were the alterations which it\r\noccasioned in the relative level of hill and valley, land and sea, so\r\ngreat as those effected by some subterranean movements in South America,\r\nin later times. The importance of the earthquake in question arises from\r\nthe circumstance, that Calabria is the only spot hitherto visited, both\r\nduring and after the convulsions, by men possessing sufficient leisure,\r\nzeal, and scientific information, to enable them to collect and describe\r\nwith accuracy the physical facts which throw light on geological\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.]\r\n\r\n_Authorities._--Among the numerous authorities, Vivenzio, physician to\r\nthe king of Naples, transmitted to the court a regular statement of his\r\nobservations during the continuance of the shocks; and his narrative is\r\ndrawn up with care and clearness.[663] Francesco Antonio Grimaldi, then\r\nsecretary of war, visited the different provinces at the king's command,\r\nand published a most detailed description of the permanent changes in\r\nthe surface.[664] He measured the length, breadth, and depth of the\r\ndifferent fissures and gulfs which opened, and ascertained their number\r\nin many provinces. His comments, moreover, on the reports of the\r\ninhabitants, and his explanations of their relations, are judicious and\r\ninstructive. Pignataro, a physician residing at Monteleone, a town\r\nplaced in the very centre of the convulsions, kept a register of the\r\nshocks, distinguishing them into four classes, according to their degree\r\nof violence. From his work, it appears that, in the year 1783, the\r\nnumber was 949, of which 501 were shocks of the first degree of force;\r\nand in the following year there were 151, of which 98 were of the first\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nCount Ippolito, also, and many others, wrote descriptions of the\r\nearthquake; and the Royal Academy of Naples, not satisfied with these\r\nand other observations, sent a deputation from their own body into\r\nCalabria, before the shocks had ceased, who were accompanied by artists\r\ninstructed to illustrate by drawings the physical changes of the\r\ndistrict, and the state of ruined towns and edifices. Unfortunately\r\nthese artists were not very successful in their representations of the\r\ncondition of the country, particularly when they attempted to express,\r\non a large scale, the extraordinary revolutions which many of the great\r\nand minor river-courses underwent. But many of the plates published by\r\nthe Academy are valuable; and as they are little known, I shall\r\nfrequently avail myself of them to illustrate the facts about to be\r\ndescribed.[665]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these Neapolitan sources of information, our countryman,\r\nSir William Hamilton, surveyed the district, not without some personal\r\nrisk, before the shocks had ceased; and his sketch, published in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions, supplies many facts that would otherwise\r\nhave been lost. He has explained, in a rational manner, many events\r\nwhich, as related in the language of some eye-witnesses, appeared\r\nmarvellous and incredible. Dolomieu also examined Calabria during the\r\ncatastrophe, and wrote an account of the earthquake, correcting a\r\nmistake into which Hamilton had fallen, who supposed that a part of the\r\ntract shaken had consisted of volcanic tuff. It is, indeed, a\r\ncircumstance which enhances the geological interest of the commotions\r\nwhich so often modify the surface of Calabria, that they are confined to\r\na country where there are neither ancient nor modern rocks of volcanic\r\nor trappean origin; so that at some future time, when the era of\r\ndisturbance shall have passed by, the cause of former revolutions will\r\nbe as latent as in parts of Great Britain now occupied exclusively by\r\nancient marine formations.\r\n\r\n_Extent of the area convulsed._--The convulsion of the earth, sea, and\r\nair extended over the whole of Calabria Ultra, the southeast part of\r\nCalabria Citra, and across the sea to Messina and its environs; a\r\ndistrict lying between the 38th and 39th degrees of latitude. The\r\nconcussion was perceptible over a great part of Sicily, and as far north\r\nas Naples; but the surface over which the shocks acted so forcibly as to\r\nexcite intense alarm did not generally exceed 500 square miles in area.\r\nThe soil of that part of Calabria is composed chiefly, like the southern\r\npart of Sicily, of calcareo-argillaceous strata of great thickness,\r\ncontaining marine shells. This clay is sometimes associated with beds of\r\nsand and limestone. For the most part these formations resemble in\r\nappearance and consistency the Subapennine marls, with their\r\naccompanying sands and sandstones; and the whole group bears\r\nconsiderable resemblance, in the yielding nature of its materials, to\r\nmost of our tertiary deposits in France and England. Chronologically\r\nconsidered, however, the Calabrian formations are comparatively of\r\nmodern date, often abounding in fossil shells referable to species now\r\nliving in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Vivencio, that on the 20th and 26th of March, 1783,\r\nearthquakes occurred in the islands of Zante, Cephalonia, and St. Maura;\r\nand in the last-mentioned island several public edifices and private\r\nhouses were overthrown, and many people destroyed.\r\n\r\nIf the city of Oppido, in Calabria Ultra, be taken as a centre, and\r\nround that centre a circle be described, with a radius of twenty-two\r\nmiles, this space will comprehend the surface of the country which\r\nsuffered the greatest alteration, and where all the towns and villages\r\nwere destroyed. The first shock, of February 5th, 1783, threw down, in\r\ntwo minutes, the greater part of the houses in all the cities, towns,\r\nand villages, from the western flanks of the Apennines in Calabria Ultra\r\nto Messina in Sicily, and convulsed the whole surface of the country.\r\nAnother occurred on the 28th of March, with almost equal violence. The\r\ngranitic chain which passes through Calabria from north to south, and\r\nattains the height of many thousand feet, was shaken but slightly by the\r\nfirst shock, but more rudely by some which followed.\r\n\r\nSome writers have asserted that the wave-like movements which were\r\npropagated through the recent strata, from west to east, became very\r\nviolent when they reached the point of junction with the granite, as if\r\na reaction was produced where the undulatory movement of the soft strata\r\nwas suddenly arrested by the more solid rocks. But the statement of\r\nDolomieu on this subject is most interesting, and perhaps, in a\r\ngeological point of view, the most important of all the observations\r\nwhich are recorded.[666] The Apennines, he says, which consist in great\r\npart of hard and solid granite, with some micaceous and argillaceous\r\nschists, form bare mountains with steep sides, and exhibit marks of\r\ngreat degradation. At their base newer strata are seen of sand and clay,\r\nmingled with shells; a marine deposit containing such ingredients as\r\nwould result from the decomposition of granite. The surface of this\r\nnewer (_tertiary_) formation constitutes what is called the plain of\r\nCalabria--a platform which is flat and level, except where intersected\r\nby narrow valleys or ravines, which rivers and torrents have excavated\r\nsometimes to the depth of six hundred feet. The sides of these ravines\r\nare almost perpendicular; for the superior stratum, being bound together\r\nby the roots of trees, prevents the formation of a sloping bank. The\r\nusual effect of the earthquake, he continues, was to disconnect all\r\nthose masses which either had not sufficient bases for their bulk, or\r\nwhich was supported only by lateral adherence. Hence it follows that\r\nthroughout almost the whole length of the chain, the soil which adhered\r\nto the granite at the base of the mountains Caulone, Esope, Sagra, and\r\nAspramonte, slid over the solid and steeply inclined nucleus, and\r\ndescended somewhat lower, leaving almost uninterruptedly from St. George\r\nto beyond St. Christina, a distance of from nine to ten miles, a chasm\r\nbetween the solid granitic nucleus and the sandy soil. Many lands\r\nslipping thus were carried to a considerable distance from their former\r\nposition, so as entirely to cover others; and disputes arose as to whom\r\nthe property which had thus shifted its place should belong.\r\n\r\nFrom this account of Dolomieu we might anticipate, as the result of a\r\ncontinuance of such earthquakes, first, a longitudinal valley following\r\nthe line of junction of the older and newer rocks; secondly, greater\r\ndisturbance in the newer strata near the point of contact than at a\r\ngreater distance from the mountains; phenomena very common in other\r\nparts of Italy at the junction of the Apennine and Subapennine\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nMr. Mallet, in his valuable essay on the Dynamics of Earthquakes,[667]\r\noffers the following explanation of the fact to which Dolomieu has\r\ncalled attention. When a wave of elastic compression, of which he\r\nconsiders the earth-wave to consist, passes abruptly from a body having\r\nan extremely low elasticity, such as clay and gravel, into another like\r\ngranite, whose elasticity is remarkably high, it changes not only its\r\nvelocity but in part also its course, a portion being reflected and a\r\nportion refracted. The wave being thus sent back again produces a shock\r\nin the opposite direction, doing great damage to buildings on the\r\nsurface by thus returning upon itself. At the same time, the shocks are\r\nat once eased when they get into the more elastic materials of the\r\ngranitic mountains.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the country during the Calabrian earthquakes often heaved\r\nlike the billows of a swelling sea, which produced a swimming in the\r\nhead, like sea-sickness. It is particularly stated, in almost all the\r\naccounts, that just before each shock the clouds appeared motionless;\r\nand, although no explanation is offered of this phenomenon, it is\r\nobviously the same as that observed in a ship at sea when it pitches\r\nviolently. The clouds seem arrested in their career as often as the\r\nvessel rises in a direction contrary to their course; so that the\r\nCalabrians must have experienced precisely the same motion on the land.\r\n\r\nTrees, supported by their trunks, sometimes bent during the shocks to\r\nthe earth, and touched it with their tops. This is mentioned as a\r\nwell-known fact by Dolomieu; and he assures us that he was always on his\r\nguard against the spirit of exaggeration in which the vulgar are ever\r\nready to indulge when relating these wonderful occurrences.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to suppose that these waves, which are described in\r\nItaly and other regions of earthquakes as passing along the solid\r\nsurface of the earth in a given direction like a billow on the sea, have\r\nany strict analogy with the undulations of a fluid. They are doubtless\r\nthe effects of vibrations, radiating from some deep-seated point, each\r\nof which on reaching the surface lifts up the ground, and then allows it\r\nagain to subside. As the distance between the source of the subterranean\r\nmovement and the surface must vary according to the outline of the\r\ncountry, so the vibratory jar will reach different points in succession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.\r\n\r\nShifts in the stones of two obelisks in the Convent of St Bruno.]\r\n\r\nThe Academicians relate that in some of the cities of Calabria effects\r\nwere produced seeming to indicate a whirling or vorticose movement.\r\nThus, for example, two obelisks (fig. 75) placed at the extremities of a\r\nmagnificent facade in the convent of S. Bruno, in a small town called\r\nStefano del Bosco, were observed to have undergone a movement of a\r\nsingular kind. The shock which agitated the building is described as\r\nhaving been horizontal and vorticose. The pedestal of each obelisk\r\nremained in its original place; but the separate stones above were\r\nturned partially round, and removed sometimes nine inches from their\r\nposition without falling.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested by Mr. Darwin that this kind of displacement may\r\nbe due to a vibratory rather than a whirling motion;[668] and more\r\nlately Mr. Mallet, in the paper already cited, has offered a very\r\ningenious solution of the problem. He refers the twisting simply to an\r\nelastic wave, which has moved the pedestal forwards and back again, by\r\nan alternate horizontal motion within narrow limits, and he has\r\nsucceeded in showing that a rectilinear movement in the ground may have\r\nsufficed to cause an incumbent body to turn partially round upon its\r\nbed, provided a certain relation exist between the position of the\r\ncentre of gravity of the body and its centre of adherence.[669]\r\n\r\nI shall now consider, in the first place, that class of physical changes\r\nproduced by the earthquake which are connected with alterations in the\r\nrelative level of the different parts of the land; and afterwards\r\ndescribe those which are more immediately connected with the derangement\r\nof the regular drainage of the country, and where the force of running\r\nwater co-operated with that of the earthquake.\r\n\r\n_Difficulty of ascertaining changes of level._--In regard to alterations\r\nof relative level, none of the accounts establish that they were on a\r\nconsiderable scale; but it must always be remembered that, in proportion\r\nto the area moved is the difficulty of proving that the general level\r\nhas undergone any change, unless the sea-coast happens to have\r\nparticipated in the principal movement. Even then it is often impossible\r\nto determine whether an elevation or depression even of several feet has\r\noccurred, because there is nothing to attract notice in a band of\r\nshingle and sand of unequal breadth above the level of the sea running\r\nparallel to a coast; such bands generally marking the point reached by\r\nthe waves during spring tides, or the most violent tempests. The\r\nscientific investigator has not sufficient topographical knowledge to\r\ndiscover whether the extent of beach has diminished or increased; and he\r\nwho has the necessary local information, scarcely ever feels any\r\ninterest in ascertaining the amount of the rise or fall of the ground.\r\nAdd to this the great difficulty of making correct observations, in\r\nconsequence of the enormous waves which roll in upon a coast during an\r\nearthquake, and efface every landmark near the shore.\r\n\r\n_Subsidence of the quay at Messina._--It is evidently in seaports alone\r\nthat we can look for very accurate indications of slight changes of\r\nlevel; and when we find them, we may presume that they would not be rare\r\nat other points, if equal facilities of comparing relative altitudes\r\nwere afforded. Grimaldi states (and his account is confirmed by Hamilton\r\nand others), that at Messina, in Sicily, the shore was rent; and the\r\nsoil along the port, which before the shock was perfectly level, was\r\nfound afterwards to be inclined towards the sea,--the sea itself near\r\nthe \"Banchina\" becoming deeper, and its bottom in several places\r\ndisordered. The quay also sunk down about fourteen inches below the\r\nlevel of the sea, and the houses in its vicinity were much fissured.\r\n(_Phil. Trans._ 1783.)\r\n\r\nAmong various proofs of partial elevation and depression in the\r\ninterior, the Academicians mention, in their Survey, that the ground was\r\nsometimes on the same level on both sides of new ravines and fissures,\r\nbut sometimes there had been a considerable shifting, either by the\r\nupheaving of one side, or the subsidence of the other. Thus, on the\r\nsides of long rents in the territory of Soriano, the stratified masses\r\nhad altered their relative position to the extent of from eight to\r\nfourteen palms (six to ten and a half feet).\r\n\r\n_Polistena._--Similar shifts in the strata are alluded to in the\r\nterritory of Polistena, where there appeared innumerable fissures in the\r\nearth. One of these was of great length and depth; and in parts the\r\nlevel of the corresponding sides was greatly changed. (See fig. 76.)\r\n\r\n_Terranuova._--In the town of Terranuova some houses were seen uplifted\r\nabove the common level, and others adjoining sunk down into the earth.\r\nIn several streets the soil appeared thrust up, and abutted against the\r\nwalls of houses: a large circular tower of solid masonry, part of which\r\nhad withstood the general destruction, was divided by a vertical rent,\r\nand one side was upraised, and the foundations heaved out of the ground.\r\nIt was compared by the Academicians to a great tooth half extracted\r\nfrom the alveolus, with the upper part of the fangs exposed. (See fig.\r\n77.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.\r\n\r\nDeep fissure, near Polistena, caused by the earthquake of 1783.]\r\n\r\nAlong the line of this shift, or \"fault,\" as it would be termed\r\ntechnically by miners, the walls were found to adhere firmly to each\r\nother, and to fit so well, that the only signs of their having been\r\ndisunited was the want of correspondence in the courses of stone on\r\neither side of the rent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.\r\n\r\nShift or \"fault\" in the Round Tower of Terranuova in Calabria,\r\noccasioned by the earthquake of 1783.]\r\n\r\nDolomieu saw a stone well in the convent of the Augustins at Terranuova,\r\nwhich had the appearance of having been driven out of the earth. It\r\nresembled a small tower eight or nine feet in height, and a little\r\ninclined. This effect, he says, was produced by the consolidation and\r\nconsequent sinking of the sandy soil in which the well was dug.\r\n\r\nIn some walls which had been thrown down, or violently shaken, in\r\nMonteleone, the separate stones were parted from the mortar, so as to\r\nleave an exact mould where they had rested; whereas in other cases the\r\nmortar was ground to dust between the stones.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the wave-like motions often produced effects of the most\r\ncapricious kind. Thus, in some streets of Monteleone, every house was\r\nthrown down but one; in others, all but two; and the buildings which\r\nwere spared were often scarcely in the least degree injured. In many\r\ncities of Calabria, all the most solid buildings were thrown down, while\r\nthose which were slightly built escaped; but at Rosarno, as also at\r\nMessina in Sicily, it was precisely the reverse, the massive edifices\r\nbeing the only ones that stood.\r\n\r\n_Fissures._--It appears evident that a great part of the rending and\r\nfissuring of the ground was the effect of a violent motion from below\r\nupwards; and in a multitude of cases where the rents and chasms opened\r\nand closed alternately, we must suppose that the earth was by turns\r\nheaved up, and then let fall again.[670] We may conceive the same effect\r\nto be produced on a small scale, if, by some mechanical force, a\r\npavement composed of large flags of stone should be raised up, and then\r\nallowed to fall suddenly, so as to resume its original position. If any\r\nsmall pebbles happened to be lying on the line of contact of two flags,\r\nthey would fall into the opening when the pavement rose, and be\r\nswallowed up, so that no trace of them would appear after the subsidence\r\nof the stones. In the same manner, when the earth was upheaved, large\r\nhouses, trees, cattle, and men were engulfed in an instant in chasms and\r\nfissures; and when the ground sank down again, the earth closed upon\r\nthem, so that no vestige of them was discoverable on the surface. In\r\nmany instances, individuals were swallowed up by one shock, and then\r\nthrown out again alive, together with large jets of water, by the shock\r\nwhich immediately succeeded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.\r\n\r\nFissures near Jerocarne, in Calabria, caused by the earthquake of 1783.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Jerocarne, a country which, according to the Academicians, was\r\n_lacerated_ in a most extraordinary manner, the fissures ran in every\r\ndirection, \"like cracks on a broken pane of glass\" (see fig. 78); and as\r\na great portion of them remained open after the shocks, it is very\r\npossible that this country was permanently upraised. It was usual, as we\r\nlearn from Dolomieu, for the chasms and fissures throughout Calabria, to\r\nran parallel to the course of some pre-existing gorges in their\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\n_Houses engulfed._--In the vicinity of Oppido, the central point from\r\nwhich the earthquake diffused its violent movements, many houses were\r\nswallowed up by the yawning earth, which closed immediately over them.\r\nIn the adjacent district, also, of Cannamaria four farm-houses, several\r\noil-stores, and some spacious dwelling-houses were so completely\r\nengulfed in one chasm, that not a vestige of them was afterwards\r\ndiscernible. The same phenomena occurred at Terranuova, S. Christina,\r\nand Sinopoli. The Academicians state particularly, that when deep\r\nabysses had opened in the argillaceous strata of Terranuova, and houses\r\nhad sunk into them, the sides of the chasms closed with such violence,\r\nthat, on excavating afterwards to recover articles of value, the workmen\r\nfound the contents and detached parts of the buildings jammed together\r\nso as to become one compact mass. It is unnecessary to accumulate\r\nexamples of similar occurrences; but so many are well authenticated\r\nduring this earthquake in Calabria, that we may, without hesitation,\r\nyield assent to the accounts of catastrophes of the same kind repeated\r\nagain and again in history, where whole towns are declared to have been\r\nengulfed, and nothing but a pool of water or tract of sand left in their\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n_Chasm formed near Oppido._--On the sloping side of a hill near Oppido a\r\ngreat chasm opened; and, although a large quantity of soil was\r\nprecipitated into the abyss, together with a considerable number of\r\nolive-trees and part of a vineyard, a great gulf remained after the\r\nshock, in the form of an amphitheatre, 500 feet long and 200 feet deep.\r\n(See fig. 79.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.\r\n\r\nChasm formed by the earthquake of 1783, near Oppido in Calabria.]\r\n\r\n_Dimensions of new fissures and chasms._--According to Grimaldi, many\r\nfissures and chasms, formed by the first shock of February 5th, were\r\ngreatly widened, lengthened, and deepened by the violent convulsions of\r\nMarch 28th. In the territory of San Fili this observer found a new\r\nravine, half a mile in length, two feet and a half broad, and\r\ntwenty-five feet deep; and another of similar dimensions in the\r\nterritory of Rosarno. A ravine _nearly a mile long_, 105 feet broad and\r\nthirty feet deep, opened in the district of Plaisano, where, also, two\r\ngulfs were caused--one in a place called Cerzulle, three-quarters of a\r\nmile long, 150 feet broad, and above _one hundred feet deep_; and\r\nanother at La Fortuna, nearly a quarter of a mile long, above thirty\r\nfeet in breadth, and no less than 225 feet deep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.\r\n\r\nChasm in the hill of St. Angelo, near Soriano, in Calabria, caused by\r\nthe earthquake of 1783.]\r\n\r\nIn the district of Fosolano three gulfs opened: one of these measured\r\n300 feet square, and above thirty feet deep; another was nearly half a\r\nmile long, fifteen feet broad, and above thirty-feet deep; the third was\r\n750 feet square. Lastly, a calcareous mountain, called Zefirio, at the\r\nsouthern extremity of the Italian peninsula, was cleft in two for the\r\nlength of nearly half a mile, and an irregular breadth of many feet.\r\nSome of these chasms were in the form of a crescent. The annexed cut\r\n(fig. 80) represents one by no means remarkable for its dimensions,\r\nwhich remained open by the side of a small pass over the hill of St.\r\nAngelo, near Soriano. The small river Mesima is seen in the foreground.\r\n\r\n_Formation of circular hollows and new lakes._--In the report of the\r\nAcademy, we find that some plains were covered with circular hollows,\r\nfor the most part about the size of carriage-wheels, but often somewhat\r\nlarger or smaller. When filled with water to within a foot or two of the\r\nsurface, they appeared like wells; but, in general, they were filled\r\nwith dry sand, sometimes with a concave surface, and at other times\r\nconvex. (See fig. 81.) On digging down, they found them to be\r\nfunnel-shaped, and the moist loose sand in the centre marked the tube up\r\nwhich the water spouted. The annexed cut (fig. 82) represents a section\r\nof one of these inverted cones when the water had disappeared, and\r\nnothing but dry micaceous sand remained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.\r\n\r\nCircular hollows in the plain of Rosarno, formed by the earthquake of\r\n1783.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.\r\n\r\nSection of one of the circular hollows formed in the plain of Rosarno.]\r\n\r\nA small circular pond of similar character was formed not far from\r\nPolistena (see fig. 83); and in the vicinity of Seminara, a lake was\r\nsuddenly caused by the opening of a great chasm, from the bottom of\r\nwhich water issued. This lake was called Lago del Tolfilo. It extended\r\n1785 feet in length, by 937 in breadth, and 52 in depth. The\r\ninhabitants, dreading the miasma of this stagnant pool, endeavored, at\r\ngreat cost, to drain it by canals, but without success, as it was fed by\r\nsprings issuing from the bottom of the deep chasm.\r\n\r\nVivenzio states, that near Sitizzano a valley was nearly filled up to a\r\nlevel with the high grounds on each side, by the enormous masses\r\ndetached from the boundary hills, and cast down into the course of two\r\nstreams. By this barrier a lake was formed of great depth, about two\r\nmiles long and a mile broad. The same author mentions that, upon the\r\nwhole, there were fifty lakes occasioned during the convulsions: and he\r\nassigns localities to all of these. The government surveyors enumerated\r\n215 lakes; but they included in this number many small ponds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.\r\n\r\nCircular pond near Polistena, in Calabria, caused by the earthquake in\r\n1783.]\r\n\r\n_Cones of sand thrown up._--Many of the appearances exhibited in the\r\nalluvial plains, such as springs spouting up their water like fountains\r\nat the moment of the shock, have been supposed to indicate the alternate\r\nrising and sinking of the ground. The first effect of the more violent\r\nshocks was usually to dry up the rivers, but they immediately afterwards\r\noverflowed their banks. In marshy places, an immense number of cones of\r\nsand were thrown up. These appearances Hamilton explains, by supposing\r\nthat the first movement raised the fissured plain from below upwards, so\r\nthat the rivers and stagnant waters in bogs sank down, or at least were\r\nnot upraised with the soil. But when the ground returned with violence\r\nto its former position, the water was thrown up in jets through\r\nfissures.[671]\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon, according to Mr. Mallet, may be simply an accident\r\ncontingent on the principal cause of disturbance, the rapid transit of\r\nthe earth-wave. \"The sources,\" he says, \"of copious springs usually lie\r\nin flat plates or fissures filled with water, whether issuing from solid\r\nrock, or from loose materials; now, if a vein, or thin flat cavity\r\nfilled with water, be in such a position that the plane of the plate of\r\nwater or fissure be transverse to the line of transit of the earth-wave,\r\nthe effect of the arrival of the earth-wave at the watery fissure will\r\nbe, at the instant, to compress its walls more or less together, and so\r\nsqueeze out the water, which will, for a moment, gush up at the\r\nspring-head like a fountain, and again remain in repose after the\r\ntransit of the wave.\"\r\n\r\n_Gradual closing in of fissures._--Sir W. Hamilton was shown several\r\ndeep fissures in the vicinity of Mileto, which, although not one of\r\nthem was above a foot in breadth, had opened so wide during the\r\nearthquake as to swallow an ox and nearly one hundred goats. The\r\nAcademicians also found, on their return through districts which they\r\nhad passed at the commencement of their tour, that many rents had, in\r\nthat short interval, gradually closed in, so that their width had\r\ndiminished several feet, and the opposite walls had sometimes nearly\r\nmet. It is natural that this should happen in argillaceous strata,\r\nwhile, in more solid rocks, we may expect that fissures will remain open\r\nfor ages. Should this be ascertained to be a general fact in countries\r\nconvulsed by earthquakes, it may afford a satisfactory explanation of a\r\ncommon phenomenon in mineral veins. Such veins often retain their full\r\nsize so long as the rocks consist of limestone, granite, or other\r\nindurated materials; but they contract their dimensions, become mere\r\nthreads, or are even entirely cut off, where masses of an argillaceous\r\nnature are interposed. If we suppose the filling up of fissures with\r\nmetallic and other ingredients to be a process requiring ages for its\r\ncompletion, it is obvious that the opposite walls of rents, where strata\r\nconsist of yielding materials, must collapse or approach very near to\r\neach other before sufficient time is allowed for the accretion of a\r\nlarge quantity of veinstone.\r\n\r\n_Thermal waters augmented._--It is stated by Grimaldi, that the thermal\r\nwaters of St. Eufemia, in Terra di Amato, which first burst out during\r\nthe earthquake of 1638, acquired, in February, 1783, an augmentation\r\nboth in quantity and degree of heat. This fact appears to indicate a\r\nconnection between the heat of the interior and the fissures caused by\r\nthe Calabrian earthquakes, notwithstanding the absence of volcanic\r\nrocks, either ancient or modern, in that district.\r\n\r\n_Bounding of detached masses into the air._--The violence of the\r\nmovement of the ground upwards was singularly illustrated by what the\r\nAcademicians call the \"sbalzo,\" or bounding into the air, to the height\r\nof several yards, of masses slightly adhering to the surface. In some\r\ntowns a great part of the pavement stones were thrown up, and found\r\nlying with their lower sides uppermost. In these cases, we must suppose\r\nthat they were propelled upwards by the momentum which they had\r\nacquired; and that the adhesion of one end of the mass being greater\r\nthan that of the other, a rotatory motion had been communicated to them.\r\nWhen the stone was projected to a sufficient height to perform somewhat\r\nmore than a quarter of a revolution in the air, it pitched down on its\r\nedge, and fell with its lower side uppermost.\r\n\r\n_Effects of earthquakes on the excavations of valleys._--The next class\r\nof effects to be considered, are those more immediately connected with\r\nthe formation of valleys, in which the action of water was often\r\ncombined with that of the earthquake. The country agitated was composed,\r\nas before stated, chiefly of argillaceous strata, intersected by deep\r\nnarrow valleys, sometimes from 500 to 600 feet deep. As the boundary\r\ncliffs were in great part vertical, it will readily be conceived that,\r\namidst the various movements of the earth, the precipices overhanging\r\nrivers, being without support on one side, were often thrown down. We\r\nfind, indeed, that inundations produced by obstructions in river-courses\r\nare among the most disastrous consequences of great earthquakes in all\r\nparts of the world, for the alluvial plains in the bottoms of valleys\r\nare usually the most fertile and well-peopled parts of the whole\r\ncountry; and whether the site of a town is above or below a temporary\r\nbarrier in the channel of a river, it is exposed to injury by the waters\r\neither of a lake or flood.\r\n\r\n_Landslips._--From each side of the deep valley or ravine of Terranuova\r\nenormous masses of the adjoining flat country were detached, and cast\r\ndown into the course of the river, so as to give rise to great lakes.\r\nOaks, olive-trees, vineyards, and corn, were often seen growing at the\r\nbottom of the ravine, as little injured as their former companions,\r\nwhich still continued to flourish in the plain above, at least 500 feet\r\nhigher, and at the distance of about three-quarters of a mile. In one\r\npart of this ravine was an enormous mass, 200 feet high and about 400\r\nfeet at its base, which had been detached by some former earthquake. It\r\nis well attested, that this mass travelled down the ravine nearly four\r\nmiles, having been put in motion by the earthquake of the 5th of\r\nFebruary. Hamilton, after examining the spot, declared that this\r\nphenomenon might be accounted for by the declivity of the valley, the\r\ngreat abundance of rain which fell, and the great weight of the alluvial\r\nmatter which pressed behind it. Dolomieu also alludes to the fresh\r\nimpulse derived from other masses falling, and pressing upon the rear of\r\nthose first set in motion.\r\n\r\nThe first account sent to Naples of the two great slides or landslips\r\nabove alluded to, which caused a great lake near Terranuova, was couched\r\nin these words:--\"Two mountains on the opposite sides of a valley walked\r\nfrom their original position until they met in the middle of the plain,\r\nand there joining together, they intercepted the course of a river,\" &c.\r\nThe expressions here used resemble singularly those applied to\r\nphenomena, probably very analogous, which are said to have occurred at\r\nFez, during the great Lisbon earthquake, as also in Jamaica and Java at\r\nother periods.\r\n\r\nNot far from Soriano, which was levelled to the ground by the great\r\nshock of February, a small valley, containing a beautiful olive-grove,\r\ncalled Fra Ramondo, underwent a most extraordinary revolution.\r\nInnumerable fissures first traversed the river-plain in all directions,\r\nand absorbed the water until the argillaceous substratum became soaked,\r\nso that a great part of it was reduced to a state of fluid paste.\r\nStrange alterations in the outline of the ground were the consequence,\r\nas the soil to a great depth was easily moulded into any form. In\r\naddition to this change, the ruins of the neighboring hills were\r\nprecipitated into the hollow; and while many olives were uprooted,\r\nothers remained growing on the fallen masses, and inclined at various\r\nangles (see fig. 84). The small river Caridi was entirely concealed for\r\nmany days; and when at length it reappeared, it had shaped for itself an\r\nentirely new channel.\r\n\r\n_Buildings transported entire to great distances._--Near Seminara an\r\nextensive olive-ground and orchard were hurled to a distance of two\r\nhundred feet, into a valley sixty feet in depth. At the same time a deep\r\nchasm was riven in another part of the high platform from which the\r\norchard had been detached, and the river immediately entered the\r\nfissure, leaving its former bed completely dry. A small inhabited house,\r\nstanding on the mass of earth carried down into the valley, went along\r\nwith it entire, and without injury to the inhabitants. The olive-trees,\r\nalso, continued to grow on the land which had slid into the valley, and\r\nbore the same year an abundant crop of fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.\r\n\r\nChanges of the surface at Fra Ramondo, near Soriano, in Calabria.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1, Portion of a hill covered with olives thrown down.\r\n  2, New bed of the river Caridi.   3, Town of Soriano.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nTwo tracts of land on which a great part of the town of Polistena stood,\r\nconsisting of some hundreds of houses, were detached into a contiguous\r\nravine, and nearly across it, about half a mile from their original\r\nsite; and what is most extraordinary, several of the inhabitants were\r\ndug out from the ruins alive and unhurt.\r\n\r\nTwo tenements, near Mileto, called the Macini and Vaticano, occupying an\r\nextent of ground about a mile long and half a mile broad, were carried\r\nfor a mile down a valley. A thatched cottage, together with large olive\r\nand mulberry trees, most of which remained erect, were carried uninjured\r\nto this extraordinary distance. According to Hamilton, the surface\r\nremoved had been long undermined by rivulets, which were afterwards in\r\nfull view on the bare spot deserted by the tenements. The earthquake\r\nseems to have opened a passage in the adjoining argillaceous hills,\r\nwhich admitted water charged with loose soil into the subterranean\r\nchannels of the rivulets immediately under the tenements, so that the\r\nfoundations of the ground set in motion by the earthquake were loosened.\r\nAnother example of subsidence, where the edifices were not destroyed,\r\nis mentioned by Grimaldi, as having taken place in the city of\r\nCatanzaro, the capital of the province of that name. The houses in the\r\nquarter called San Giuseppe subsided with the ground to various depths\r\nfrom two to four feet, but the buildings remained uninjured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.\r\n\r\nLandslips near Cinquefrondi, caused by the earthquake of 1783.]\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious, and our space would not permit us, to follow the\r\ndifferent authors through their local details of landslips produced in\r\nminor valleys; but they are highly interesting, as showing to how great\r\nan extent the power of rivers to widen valleys, and to carry away large\r\nportions of soil towards the sea, is increased where earthquakes are of\r\nperiodical occurrence. Among other territories, that of Cinquefrondi,\r\nwas greatly convulsed, various portions of soil being raised or sunk,\r\nand innumerable fissures traversing the country in all directions (see\r\nfig. 85). Along the flanks of a small valley in this district there\r\nappears to have been an almost uninterrupted line of landslips.\r\n\r\n_Currents of mud._--Near S. Lucido, among other places, the soil is\r\ndescribed as having been \"dissolved,\" so that large torrents of mud\r\ninundated all the low grounds, like lava. Just emerging from this mud,\r\nthe tops only of trees and of the ruins of farm-houses were seen. Two\r\nmiles from Laureana, the swampy soil in two ravines became filled with\r\ncalcareous matter, which oozed out from the ground immediately before\r\nthe first great shock. This mud, rapidly accumulating, began, ere long,\r\nto roll onward, like a flood of lava, into the valley, where the two\r\nstreams uniting, moved forward with increased impetus from east to west.\r\nIt now presented a breadth of 225 feet by 15 in depth, and, before it\r\nceased to move, covered a surface equal in length to an Italian mile. In\r\nits progress it overwhelmed a flock of thirty goats, and tore up by the\r\nroots many olive and mulberry trees, which floated like ships upon its\r\nsurface. When this calcareous lava had ceased to move, it gradually\r\nbecame dry and hard, during which process the mass was lowered seven\r\nfeet and a half. It contained fragments of earth of a ferruginous\r\ncolor, and emitting a sulphureous smell.\r\n\r\n_Fall of the sea-cliffs._--Along the sea-coast of the Straits of\r\nMessina, near the celebrated rock of Scilla, the fall of huge masses\r\ndetached from the bold and lofty cliffs overwhelmed many villas and\r\ngardens. At Gian Greco, a continuous line of cliff, for a mile in\r\nlength, was thrown down. Great agitation was frequently observed in the\r\nbed of the sea during the shocks, and, on those parts of the coast where\r\nthe movement was most violent, all kinds of fish were taken in\r\nabundance, and with unusual facility. Some rare species, as that called\r\nCicirelli, which usually lie buried in the sand, were taken on the\r\nsurface of the waters in great quantity. The sea is said to have boiled\r\nup near Messina, and to have been agitated as if by a copious discharge\r\nof vapors from its bottom.\r\n\r\n_Shore near Scilla inundated._--The prince of Scilla had persuaded a\r\ngreat part of his vassals to betake themselves to their fishing-boats\r\nfor safety, and he himself had gone on board. On the night of the 5th of\r\nFebruary, when some of the people were sleeping in the boats, and others\r\non a level plain slightly elevated above the sea, the earth rocked, and\r\nsuddenly a great mass was torn from the contiguous Mount Jaci, and\r\nthrown down with a dreadful crash upon the plain. Immediately\r\nafterwards, the sea, rising more than twenty feet above the level of\r\nthis low tract, rolled foaming over it, and swept away the multitude. It\r\nthen retreated, but soon rushed back again with greater violence,\r\nbringing with it some of the people and animals it had carried away. At\r\nthe same time every boat was sunk or dashed against the beach, and some\r\nof them were swept far inland. The aged prince, with 1430 of his people,\r\nwas destroyed.\r\n\r\n_State of Stromboli and Etna during the shocks._--The inhabitants of\r\nPizzo remarked that on the 5th of February, 1783, when the first great\r\nshock afflicted Calabria, the volcano of Stromboli, which is in full\r\nview of that town, and at the distance of about fifty miles, smoked\r\nless, and threw up a less quantity of inflamed matter than it had done\r\nfor some years previously. On the other hand, the great crater of Etna\r\nis said to have given out a considerable quantity of vapor towards the\r\nbeginning, and Stromboli towards the close, of the commotions. But as no\r\neruption happened from either of these great vents during the whole\r\nearthquake, the sources of the Calabrian convulsions, and of the\r\nvolcanic fires of Etna and Stromboli, appear to be very independent of\r\neach other; unless, indeed, they have the same mutual relation as\r\nVesuvius and the volcanoes of the Phlegraean Fields and Ischia, a violent\r\ndisturbance in one district serving as a safety-valve to the other, and\r\nboth never being in full activity at once.\r\n\r\n_Excavation of valleys._--It is impossible for the geologist to consider\r\nattentively the effect of this single earthquake of 1783, and to look\r\nforward to the alterations in the physical condition of the country to\r\nwhich a continued series of such movements will hereafter give rise,\r\nwithout perceiving that the formation of valleys by running water can\r\nnever be understood, if we consider the question independently of the\r\nagency of earthquakes. It must not be imagined that rivers only begin to\r\nact when a country is already elevated far above the level of the sea,\r\nfor their action must of necessity be most powerful while land is\r\n_rising_ and _sinking_ by successive movements. Whether Calabria is now\r\nundergoing any considerable change of relative level, in regard to the\r\nsea, or is, upon the whole, nearly stationary, is a question which our\r\nobservations, confined almost entirely to the last half century, cannot\r\npossibly enable us to determine. But we know that strata, containing\r\nspecies of shells identical with those now living in the contiguous\r\nparts of the Mediterranean, have been raised in that country, as they\r\nhave in Sicily, to the height of several thousand feet.\r\n\r\nNow, those geologists who grant that the present course of Nature in the\r\ninanimate world has continued the same since the existing species of\r\nanimals were in being, will not feel surprised that the Calabrian\r\nstreams and rivers have cut out of such comparatively modern strata a\r\ngreat system of valleys, varying in depth from fifty to six hundred\r\nfeet, and often several miles wide, if they consider how numerous may\r\nhave been the shocks which accompanied the uplifting of those recent\r\nmarine strata to so prodigious a height. Some speculators, indeed, who\r\ndisregard the analogy of existing nature, and who are always ready to\r\nassume that her forces were more energetic in by-gone ages, may dispense\r\nwith a long series of movements, and suppose that Calabria \"rose like an\r\nexhalation\" from the deep, after the manner of Milton's Pandemonium. But\r\nsuch an hypothesis would deprive them of that peculiar removing force\r\nrequired to form a regular system of deep and wide valleys; for _time_,\r\nwhich they are so unwilling to assume, is essential to the operation.\r\nTime must be allowed in the intervals between distinct convulsions, for\r\nrunning water to clear away the ruins caused by landslips, otherwise the\r\nfallen masses will serve as buttresses, and prevent the succeeding\r\nearthquake from exerting its full power. The sides of the valley must be\r\nagain cut away by the stream, and made to form precipices and\r\nover-hanging cliffs, before the next shock can take effect in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nPossibly the direction of the succeeding shock may not coincide with\r\nthat of the valley, a great extent of adjacent country being equally\r\nshaken. Still it will usually happen that no permanent geographical\r\nchange will be produced except in valleys. In them alone will occur\r\nlandslips from the boundary cliffs, and these will frequently divert the\r\nstream from its accustomed course, causing the original ravine to become\r\nboth wider and more tortuous in its direction.\r\n\r\nIf a single convulsion of extreme violence should agitate at once an\r\nentire hydrographical basin, or if the shocks should follow each other\r\ntoo rapidly, the previously existing valleys would be annihilated,\r\ninstead of being modified and enlarged. Every stream might in that case\r\nbe compelled to begin its operations anew, and to shape out new\r\nchannels, instead of continuing to deepen and widen those already\r\nexcavated. But if the subterranean movements have been intermittent, and\r\nif sufficient periods have always intervened between the severer shocks\r\nto allow the drainage of the country to be nearly restored to its\r\noriginal state, then are both the kind and degree of force supplied by\r\nwhich running water may hollow out valleys of any depth or size\r\nconsistent with the elevation above the sea which the districts drained\r\nby them may have attained.\r\n\r\nWhen we read of the drying up and desertion of the channels of rivers,\r\nthe accounts most frequently refer to their deflection into some other\r\npart of the same alluvial plain, perhaps several miles distant. Under\r\ncertain circumstances a change of level may undoubtedly force the water\r\nto flow over into some distinct hydrographical basin; but even then it\r\nwill fall immediately into some other system of valleys already formed.\r\n\r\nWe learn from history that, ever since the first Greek colonists settled\r\nin Calabria, that region has been subject to devastation by earthquakes;\r\nand, for the last century and a half, ten years have seldom elapsed\r\nwithout a shock; but the severer convulsions have not only been\r\nseparated by intervals of twenty, fifty, or one hundred years, but have\r\nnot affected precisely the same points when they recurred. Thus the\r\nearthquake of 1783, although confined within the same geographical\r\nlimits as that of 1638, and not very inferior in violence, visited,\r\naccording to Grimaldi, very different districts. The points where the\r\nlocal intensity of the force is developed being thus perpetually varied,\r\nmore time is allowed for the removal of separate mountain masses thrown\r\ninto river-channels by each shock.\r\n\r\n_Number of persons who perished during the earthquake._--The number of\r\npersons who perished during the earthquake in the two Calabrias and\r\nSicily, is estimated by Hamilton at about forty thousand; and about\r\ntwenty thousand more died by epidemics, which were caused by\r\ninsufficient nourishment, exposure to the atmosphere, and malaria,\r\narising from the new stagnant lakes and pools.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater number were buried under the ruins of their houses;\r\nbut many were burnt to death in the conflagrations which almost\r\ninvariably followed the shocks. These fires raged the more violently in\r\nsome cities, such as Oppido, from the immense magazines of oil which\r\nwere consumed.\r\n\r\nMany persons were engulfed in deep fissures, especially the peasants\r\nwhen flying across the open country, and their skeletons may perhaps be\r\nburied in the earth to this day, at the depth of several hundred feet.\r\n\r\nWhen Dolomieu visited Messina after the shock of Feb. 5th, he describes\r\nthe city as still presenting, at least at a distance, an imperfect image\r\nof its ancient splendor. Every house was injured, but the walls were\r\nstanding; the whole population had taken refuge in wooden huts in the\r\nneighborhood, and all was solitude and silence in the streets: it seemed\r\nas if the city had been desolated by the plague, and the impression made\r\nupon his feelings was that of melancholy and sadness. \"But when I passed\r\nover to Calabria, and first beheld Polistena, the scene of horror almost\r\ndeprived me of my faculties; my mind was filled with mingled compassion\r\nand terror; nothing had escaped; all was levelled with the dust; not a\r\nsingle house or piece of wall remained; on all sides were heaps of stone\r\nso destitute of form, that they gave no conception of there ever having\r\nbeen a town on the spot. The stench of the dead bodies still rose from\r\nthe ruins. I conversed with many persons who had been buried for three,\r\nfour, and even for five days; I questioned them respecting their\r\nsensations in so dreadful a situation, and they agreed that of all the\r\nphysical evils they endured, thirst was the most intolerable; and that\r\ntheir mental agony was increased by the idea that they were abandoned by\r\ntheir friends, who might have rendered them assistance.\"[672]\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that about a fourth part of the inhabitants of Polistena,\r\nand of some other towns, were buried alive, and might have been saved\r\nhad there been no want of hands; but in so general a calamity, where\r\neach was occupied with his own misfortunes or those of his family, aid\r\ncould rarely be obtained. Neither tears, nor supplications, nor promises\r\nof high rewards were listened to. Many acts of self-devotion, prompted\r\nby parental and conjugal tenderness, or by friendship, or the gratitude\r\nof faithful servants, are recorded; but individual exertions were, for\r\nthe most part, ineffectual. It frequently happened, that persons in\r\nsearch of those most dear to them could hear their moans,--could\r\nrecognize their voices--were certain of the exact spot where they lay\r\nburied beneath their feet, yet could afford them no succor. The piled\r\nmass resisted all their strength, and rendered their efforts of no\r\navail.\r\n\r\nAt Terranuova, four Augustin monks, who had taken refuge in a vaulted\r\nsacristy, the arch of which continued to support an immense pile of\r\nruins, made their cries heard for the space of four days. One only of\r\nthe brethren of the whole convent was saved, and \"of what avail was his\r\nstrength to remove the enormous weight of rubbish which had overwhelmed\r\nhis companions?\" He heard their voices die away gradually; and when\r\nafterwards their four corpses were disinterred, they were found clasped\r\nin each other's arms. Affecting narratives are preserved of mothers\r\nsaved after the fifth, sixth, and even seventh day of their interment,\r\nwhen their infants or children had perished with hunger.\r\n\r\nIt might have been imagined that the sight of sufferings such as these\r\nwould have been sufficient to awaken sentiments of humanity and pity in\r\nthe most savage breasts; but while some acts of heroism are related,\r\nnothing could exceed the general atrocity of conduct displayed by the\r\nCalabrian peasants: they abandoned the farms, and flocked in great\r\nnumbers into the towns--not to rescue their countrymen from a lingering\r\ndeath, but to plunder. They dashed through the streets, fearless of\r\ndanger, amid tottering walls and clouds of dust, trampling beneath their\r\nfeet the bodies of the wounded and half-buried, and often stripping\r\nthem, while yet living, of their clothes.[673]\r\n\r\n_Concluding remarks._--But to enter more fully into these details would\r\nbe foreign to the purpose of the present work, and several volumes\r\nwould be required to give the reader a just idea of the sufferings\r\nwhich the inhabitants of many populous districts have undergone during\r\nthe earthquakes of the last 150 years. A bare mention of the loss of\r\nlife--as that fifty or a hundred thousand souls perished in one\r\ncatastrophe--conveys to the reader no idea of the extent of misery\r\ninflicted: we must learn, from the narratives of eye-witnesses, the\r\nvarious forms in which death was encountered, the numbers who escaped\r\nwith loss of limbs or serious bodily injuries, and the multitude who\r\nwere suddenly reduced to penury and want. It has been often remarked,\r\nthat the dread of earthquakes is strongest in the minds of those who\r\nhave experienced them most frequently; whereas, in the case of almost\r\nevery other danger, familiarity with peril renders men intrepid. The\r\nreason is obvious--scarcely any part of the mischief apprehended in this\r\ninstance is imaginary; the first shock is often the most destructive;\r\nand, as it may occur in the dead of the night, or if by day, without\r\ngiving the least warning of its approach, no forethought can guard\r\nagainst it; and when the convulsion has begun, no skill, or courage, or\r\npresence of mind, can point out the path of safety. During the\r\nintervals, of uncertain duration, between the more fatal shocks, slight\r\ntremors of the soil are not unfrequent; and as these sometimes precede\r\nmore violent convulsions, they become a source of anxiety and alarm. The\r\nterror arising from this cause alone is of itself no inconsiderable\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nAlthough sentiments of pure religion are frequently awakened by these\r\nawful visitations, yet we more commonly find that an habitual state of\r\nfear, a sense of helplessness, and a belief in the futility of all human\r\nexertions, prepare the minds of the vulgar for the influence of a\r\ndemoralizing superstition.\r\n\r\nWhere earthquakes are frequent, there can never be perfect security of\r\nproperty under the best government; industry cannot be assured of\r\nreaping the fruits of its labor; and the most daring acts of outrage may\r\noccasionally be perpetrated with impunity, when the arm of the law is\r\nparalyzed by the general consternation. It is hardly necessary to add,\r\nthat the progress of civilization and national wealth must be retarded\r\nby convulsions which level cities to the ground, destroy harbors, render\r\nroads impassable, and cause the most cultivated valley-plains to be\r\ncovered with lakes, or the ruins of adjoining hills.\r\n\r\nThose geologists who imagine that, at remote periods ere man became a\r\nsojourner on earth, the volcanic agency was more energetic than now,\r\nshould be careful to found their opinion on strict geological evidence,\r\nand not permit themselves to be biased, as they have often been, by a\r\nnotion, that the disturbing force would probably be mitigated for the\r\nsake of man.\r\n\r\nI shall endeavor to point out in the sequel, that the general tendency\r\nof subterranean movements, when their effects are considered for a\r\nsufficient lapse of ages, is eminently beneficial, and that they\r\nconstitute an essential part of that mechanism by which the integrity of\r\nthe habitable surface is preserved, and the very existence and\r\nperpetuation of dry land secured. Why the working of this same\r\nmachinery should be attended with so much evil, is a mystery far beyond\r\nthe reach of our philosophy, and must probably remain so until we are\r\npermitted to investigate, not our planet alone and its inhabitants, but\r\nother parts of the moral and material universe with which they may be\r\nconnected. Could our survey embrace other worlds, and the events, not of\r\na few centuries only, but of periods as indefinite as those with which\r\ngeology renders us familiar, some apparent contradictions might be\r\nreconciled, and some difficulties would doubtless be cleared up. But\r\neven then, as our capacities are finite, while the scheme of the\r\nuniverse may be infinite, both in time and space, it is presumptuous to\r\nsuppose that all sources of doubt and perplexity would ever be removed.\r\nOn the contrary, they might, perhaps, go on augmenting in number,\r\nalthough our confidence in the wisdom of the plan of Nature should\r\nincrease at the same time; for it has been justly said, that the greater\r\nthe circle of light, the greater the boundary of darkness by which it is\r\nsurrounded.[674]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES--_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Earthquake of Java, 1772--Truncation of a lofty cone--St. Domingo,\r\n    1770--Lisbon, 1755--Great area over which the shocks\r\n    extended--Retreat of the sea--Proposed explanations--Conception Bay,\r\n    1750--Permanent elevation--Peru, 1746--Java, 1699--Rivers obstructed\r\n    by landslips--Subsidence in Sicily, 1693--Moluccas, 1693--Jamaica,\r\n    1692--Large tracts engulfed--Portion of Port Royal sunk--Amount of\r\n    change in the last 150 years--Elevation and subsidence of land in\r\n    Bay of Baiae--Evidence of the same afforded by the Temple of Serapis.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters we have considered a small part only of those\r\nearthquakes which have occurred during the last seventy years, of which\r\naccurate and authentic descriptions happen to have been recorded. In\r\nexamining those of earlier date, we find their number so great that\r\nallusion can be made to a few only respecting which information of\r\npeculiar geological interest has been obtained.\r\n\r\n_Java_, 1772.--_Truncation of a lofty cone._--In the year 1772,\r\nPapandayang, formerly one of the loftiest volcanoes in the island of\r\nJava, was in eruption. Before all the inhabitants on the declivities of\r\nthe mountain could save themselves by flight, the ground began to give\r\nway, and a great part of the volcano fell in and disappeared. It is\r\nestimated that an extent of ground of the mountain itself and its\r\nimmediate environs, fifteen miles long and full six broad, was by this\r\ncommotion swallowed up in the bowels of the earth. Forty villages were\r\ndestroyed, some being engulfed and some covered by the substances thrown\r\nout on this occasion, and 2957 of the inhabitants perished. A\r\nproportionate number of cattle were also killed, and most of the\r\nplantations of cotton, indigo, and coffee in the adjacent districts were\r\nburied under the volcanic matter. This catastrophe appears to have\r\nresembled, although on a grander scale, that of the ancient Vesuvius in\r\nthe year 79. The cone was reduced in height from 9000 to about 5000\r\nfeet; and, as vapors still escape from the crater on its summit, a new\r\ncone may one day rise out of the ruins of the ancient mountain, as the\r\nmodern Vesuvius has risen from the remains of Somma.[675]\r\n\r\n_St. Domingo_, 1770.--During a tremendous earthquake which destroyed a\r\ngreat part of St. Domingo, innumerable fissures were caused throughout\r\nthe island, from which mephitic vapors emanated and produced an\r\nepidemic. _Hot springs_ burst forth in many places where there had been\r\nno water before; but after a time they ceased to flow.[676]\r\n\r\nIn a previous earthquake, in November, 1751, a violent shock destroyed\r\nthe capital, Port au Prince, and part of the coast, twenty leagues in\r\nlength, sank down, and has ever since formed a bay of the sea.[677]\r\n\r\n_Hindostan_, 1762.--The town of Chittagong, in Bengal, was violently\r\nshaken by an earthquake, on the 2d of April, 1762, the earth opening in\r\nmany places, and throwing up water and mud of a sulphureous smell. At a\r\nplace called Bardavan, a large river was dried up; and at Bar Charra,\r\nnear the sea, a tract of ground sunk down, and 200 people, with all\r\ntheir cattle, were lost. It is said, that sixty square miles of the\r\nChittagong coast suddenly and permanently subsided during this\r\nearthquake, and that Ces-lung-Toom, one of the Mug mountains, entirely\r\ndisappeared, and another sank so low, that its summit only remained\r\nvisible. Four hills are also described as having been variously rent\r\nasunder, leaving open chasms from thirty to sixty feet in width. Towns\r\nwhich subsided several cubits, were overflowed with water; among others,\r\nDeep Gong, which was submerged to the depth of seven cubits. Two\r\nvolcanoes are said to have opened in the Secta Cunda hills. The shock\r\nwas also felt at Calcutta.[678] While the Chittagong coast was sinking,\r\na corresponding rise of the ground took place at the island of Ramree,\r\nand at Cheduba (see Map, fig. 39, p. 351).[679]\r\n\r\n_Lisbon_, 1755.--In no part of the volcanic region of southern Europe\r\nhas so tremendous an earthquake occurred in modern times, as that which\r\nbegan on the 1st of November, 1755, at Lisbon. A sound of thunder was\r\nheard underground, and immediately afterwards a violent shock threw down\r\nthe greater part of that city. In the course of about six minutes, sixty\r\nthousand persons perished. The sea first retired and laid the bar dry;\r\nit then rolled in, rising fifty feet or more above its ordinary level.\r\nThe mountains of Arrabida, Estrella, Julio, Marvan, and Cintra, being\r\nsome of the largest in Portugal, were impetuously shaken, as it were,\r\nfrom their very foundations; and some of them opened at their summits,\r\nwhich were split and rent in a wonderful manner, huge masses of them\r\nbeing thrown down into the subjacent valleys.[680] Flames are related to\r\nhave issued from these mountains, which are supposed to have been\r\nelectric; they are also said to have smoked; but vast clouds of dust may\r\nhave given rise to this appearance.\r\n\r\nThe area over which this convulsion extended is very remarkable. It has\r\nbeen computed, says Humboldt,[681] that on the 1st November, 1755, a\r\nportion of the earth's surface four times greater than the extent of\r\nEurope was simultaneously shaken. The shock was felt in the Alps, and on\r\nthe coast of Sweden, in small inland lakes on the shores of the Baltic,\r\nin Thuringia, and in the flat country of northern Germany. The thermal\r\nsprings of Toplitz dried up, and again returned, inundating every thing\r\nwith water discolored by ochre. In the islands of Antigua, Barbadoes,\r\nand Martinique in the West Indies, where the tide usually rises little\r\nmore than two feet, it suddenly rose above twenty feet, the water being\r\ndiscolored and of an inky blackness. The movement was also sensible in\r\nthe great lakes of Canada. At Algiers and Fez, in the north of Africa,\r\nthe agitation of the earth was as violent as in Spain and Portugal; and\r\nat the distance of eight leagues from Morocco, a village with the\r\ninhabitants, to the number of about 8000 or 10,000 persons, are said to\r\nhave been swallowed up; the earth soon afterwards closing over them.\r\n\r\n_Subsidence of the quay._--Among other extraordinary events related to\r\nhave occurred at Lisbon during the catastrophe was the subsidence of a\r\nnew quay, built entirely of marble at an immense expense. A great\r\nconcourse of people had collected there for safety, as a spot where they\r\nmight be beyond the reach of falling ruins; but suddenly the quay sank\r\ndown with all the people on it, and not one of the dead bodies ever\r\nfloated to the surface. A great number of boats and small vessels\r\nanchored near it, all full of people, were swallowed up, as in a\r\nwhirlpool.[682] No fragments of these wrecks ever rose again to the\r\nsurface, and the water in the place where the quay had stood is stated,\r\nin many accounts, to be unfathomable; but Whitehurst says he ascertained\r\nit to be one hundred fathoms.[683]\r\n\r\nCircumstantial as are the contemporary narratives, I learn from a\r\ncorrespondent, Mr. F. Freeman, in 1841, that no part of the Tagus was\r\nthen more than thirty feet deep at high tide, and an examination of the\r\nposition of the new quay, and the memorials preserved of the time and\r\nmanner in which it was built, rendered the statement of so great a\r\nsubsidence in 1755 quite unintelligible. Perhaps a deep narrow chasm,\r\nsuch as was before described in Calabria (p. 481), opened and closed\r\nagain in the bed of the Tagus, after swallowing up some incumbent\r\nbuildings and vessels. We have already seen that such openings may\r\ncollapse after the shock suddenly, or, in places where the strata are of\r\nsoft and yielding materials, very gradually. According to the\r\nobservations made at Lisbon, in 1837, by Mr. Sharpe, the destroying\r\neffects of this earthquake were confined to the tertiary strata, and\r\nwere most violent on the blue clay, on which the lower part of the city\r\nis constructed. Not a building, he says, on the secondary limestone or\r\nthe basalt was injured.[684]\r\n\r\n_Shocks felt at sea._--The shock was felt at sea, on the deck of a ship\r\nto the west of Lisbon, and produced very much the same sensation as on\r\ndry land. Off St. Lucar, the captain of the ship Nancy felt his vessel\r\nso violently shaken, that he thought she had struck the ground; but, on\r\nheaving the lead, found a great depth of water. Captain Clark, from\r\nDenia, in latitude 36 degrees 24 minutes N., between nine and ten in the\r\nmorning, had his ship shaken and strained as if she had struck upon a\r\nrock, so that the seams of the deck opened, and the compass was\r\noverturned in the binnacle. Another ship, forty leagues west of St.\r\nVincent, experienced so violent a concussion, that the men were thrown a\r\nfoot and a half perpendicularly up from the deck.\r\n\r\n_Rate at which the movement travelled._--The agitation of lakes, rivers,\r\nand springs, in Great Britain, was remarkable. At Loch Lomond, in\r\nScotland, for example, the water, without, the least apparent cause,\r\nrose against its banks, and then subsided below its usual level. The\r\ngreatest perpendicular height of this swell was two feet four inches. It\r\nis said that the movement of this earthquake was undulatory, and that it\r\ntravelled at the rate of twenty miles a minute, its velocity being\r\ncalculated by the intervals between the time when the first shock was\r\nfelt at Lisbon, and its time of occurrence at other distant places.[685]\r\n\r\n_Great wave and retreat of the sea._--A great wave swept over the coast\r\nof Spain, and is said to have been sixty feet high at Cadiz. At Tangier,\r\nin Africa, it rose and fell eighteen times on the coast. At Funchal, in\r\nMadeira, it rose full fifteen feet perpendicular above high-water mark,\r\nalthough the tide, which ebbs and flows there seven feet, was then at\r\nhalf-ebb. Besides entering the city, and committing great havoc, it\r\noverflowed other seaports in the island. At Kinsale, in Ireland, a body\r\nof water rushed into the harbor, whirled round several vessels, and\r\npoured into the market-place.\r\n\r\nIt was before stated that the sea first retired at Lisbon; and this\r\nretreat of the ocean from the shore, at the commencement of an\r\nearthquake, and its subsequent return in a violent wave, is a common\r\noccurrence. In order to account for the phenomenon, Michell imagined a\r\nsubsidence at the bottom of the sea, from the giving way of the roof of\r\nsome cavity in consequence of a vacuum produced by the condensation of\r\nsteam. Such condensation, he observes, might be the first effect of the\r\nintroduction of a large body of water into fissures and cavities already\r\nfilled with steam, before there has been sufficient time for the heat of\r\nthe incandescent lava to turn so large a supply of water into steam,\r\nwhich being soon accomplished causes a greater explosion.\r\n\r\nAnother proposed explanation is, the sudden rise of the land, which\r\nwould cause the sea to abandon immediately the ancient line of coast;\r\nand if the shore, after being thus heaved up, should fall again to its\r\noriginal level, the ocean would return. This theory, however, will not\r\naccount for the facts observed during the Lisbon earthquake; for the\r\nretreat preceded the wave, not only on the coast of Portugal, but also\r\nat the island of Madeira, and several other places. If the upheaving of\r\nthe coast of Portugal had caused the retreat, the motion of the waters,\r\nwhen propagated to Madeira, would have produced a wave previous to the\r\nretreat. Nor could the motion of the waters at Madeira have been caused\r\nby a different local earthquake; for the shock travelled from Lisbon to\r\nMadeira in two hours, which agrees with the time which it required to\r\nreach other places equally distant.[686]\r\n\r\nThe following is another solution of the problem, which has been\r\noffered:--Suppose a portion of the bed of the sea to be suddenly\r\nupheaved; the first effect will be to raise over the elevated part a\r\nbody of water, the momentum of which will carry it much above the level\r\nit will afterwards assume, causing a draught or receding of the water\r\nfrom the neighboring coasts, followed immediately by the return of the\r\ndisplaced water, which will also be impelled by its momentum much\r\nfarther and higher on the coast than its former level.[687]\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, when alluding to similar waves on the coast of Chili, states\r\nhis opinion, that \"the whole phenomenon is due to a common undulation in\r\nthe water, proceeding from a line or point of disturbance some little\r\nway distant. If the waves,\" he says, \"sent off from the paddles of a\r\nsteam-vessel be watched breaking on the sloping shore of a still river,\r\nthe water will be seen first to retire two or three feet, and then to\r\nreturn in little breakers, precisely analogous to those consequent on an\r\nearthquake.\" He also adds, that \"the earthquake-wave occurs some time\r\nafter the shock, the water at first retiring both from the shores of the\r\nmainland and of outlying islands, and then returning in mountainous\r\nbreakers. Their size is modified by the form of the neighboring coast;\r\nfor it is ascertained in South America, that places situated at the\r\nhead of shoaling bays have suffered most, whereas towns like Valparaiso,\r\nseated close on the border of a profound ocean, have never been\r\ninundated, though severely shaken by earthquakes.\"[688]\r\n\r\nMore recently (February, 1846), Mr. Mallet, in his memoir above cited\r\n(p. 475), has endeavored to bring to bear on this difficult subject the\r\nmore advanced knowledge obtained of late years respecting the true\r\ntheory of waves. He conceives that when the origin of the shock is\r\nbeneath the deep ocean, one wave is propagated through the land, and\r\nanother moving with inferior velocity is formed on the surface of the\r\nocean. This last rolls in upon the land long after the earth-wave has\r\narrived and spent itself. However irreconcilable it may be to our common\r\nnotions of solid bodies, to imagine them capable of transmitting, with\r\nsuch extreme velocity, motions analogous to tidal waves, it seems\r\nnevertheless certain that such undulations are produced, and it is\r\nsupposed that when the shock passes a given point, each particle of the\r\nsolid earth describes an ellipse in space. The facility with which all\r\nthe particles of a solid mass can be made to vibrate may be illustrated,\r\nsays Gay Lussac, by many familiar examples. If we apply the ear to one\r\nend of a long wooden beam, and listen attentively when the other end is\r\nstruck by a pin's head, we hear the shock distinctly; which shows that\r\nevery fibre throughout the whole length has been made to vibrate. The\r\nrattling of carriages on the pavement shakes the largest edifices; and\r\nin the quarries underneath some quarters in Paris, it is found that the\r\nmovement is communicated through a considerable thickness of rock.[689]\r\n\r\nThe great sea-wave originating directly over the centre of disturbance\r\nis propagated, as Michell correctly stated, in every direction, like the\r\ncircle upon a pond when a pebble is dropped into it, the different rates\r\nat which it moves depending (as he also suggested) on variations in the\r\ndepth of the water. This wave of the sea, says Mr. Mallet, is raised by\r\nthe impulse of the shock immediately below it, which in great\r\nearthquakes lifts up the ground two or three feet perpendicularly. The\r\nvelocity of the shock, or earth-wave, is greater because it \"depends\r\nupon a function of the elasticity of the crust of the earth, whereas the\r\nvelocity of the sea-wave depends upon a function of the depth of the\r\nsea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Although the shock in its passage under the deep ocean gives no trace\r\nof its progress, it no sooner gets into soundings or shallow water, than\r\nit gives rise to another and smaller wave of the sea. It carries, as it\r\nwere, upon its back, this lesser aqueous undulation; a long narrow ridge\r\nof water which corresponds in form and velocity to itself, being pushed\r\nup by the partial elevation of the bottom. It is this small wave, called\r\ntechnically the 'forced sea-wave,' which communicates the\r\nearthquake-shock to ships at sea, as if they had struck upon a rock. It\r\nbreaks upon a coast at the same moment that the shock reaches it, and\r\nsometimes it may cause an apparent slight recession from the shore,\r\nfollowed by its flowing up somewhat higher than the usual tide mark:\r\nthis will happen where the beach is very sloping, as is usual where the\r\nsea is shallow, for then the velocity of the low flat earth-wave is\r\nsuch, that it slips as it were, from under the undulation in the fluid\r\nabove. It does this at the moment of reaching the beach, which it\r\nelevates by a vertical height equal to its own, and as instantly lets\r\ndrop again to its former level.\"\r\n\r\n\"While the shock propagated through the solid earth has thus travelled\r\nwith extra rapidity to the land, the great sea-wave has been following\r\nat a slower pace, though advancing at the rate of several miles in a\r\nminute. It consists, in the deep ocean, of a long low swell of enormous\r\nvolume, having an equal slope before and behind, and that so gentle that\r\nit might pass under a ship without being noticed. But when it reaches\r\nthe edge of soundings, its front slope, like that of a tidal wave under\r\nsimilar circumstances, becomes short and steep, while its rear slope is\r\nlong and gentle. If there be water of some depth close into shore, this\r\ngreat wave may roll in long after the shock, and do little damage; but\r\nif the shore be shelving, there will be first a retreat of the water,\r\nand then the wave will break upon the beach and roll in far upon the\r\nland.\"[690]\r\n\r\nThe various opinions which have been offered by Michell and later\r\nwriters, respecting the remote causes of earthquake shocks in the\r\ninterior of the earth, will more properly be discussed in the\r\nthirty-second chapter.\r\n\r\n_Chili_, 1751.--On the 24th of May, 1751, the ancient town of\r\nConception, otherwise called Penco, was totally destroyed by an\r\nearthquake, and the sea rolled over it. (See plan of the bay, fig. 70,\r\np. 455.) The ancient port was rendered entirely useless, and the\r\ninhabitants built another town about ten miles from the sea-coast, in\r\norder to be beyond the reach of similar inundations. At the same time, a\r\ncolony recently settled on the sea-shore of Juan Fernandez was almost\r\nentirely overwhelmed by a wave which broke upon the shore.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated, that in 1835, or eighty-four years after the\r\ndestruction of Penco, the same coast was overwhelmed by a similar flood\r\nfrom the sea during an earthquake; and it is also known that twenty-one\r\nyears before (or in 1730), a like wave rolled over these fated shores,\r\nin which many of the inhabitants perished. A series of similar\r\ncatastrophes has also been tracked back as far as the year 1590,[691]\r\nbeyond which we have no memorials save those of oral tradition. Molina,\r\nwho has recorded the customs and legends of the aborigines, tells us,\r\nthat the Araucanian Indians, a tribe inhabiting the country between the\r\nAndes and the Pacific, including the part now called Chili, \"had among\r\nthem a tradition of a great deluge, in which only a few persons were\r\nsaved, who took refuge upon a high mountain called Thegtheg, \"the\r\nthundering,\" which had three points. Whenever a violent earthquake\r\noccurs, these people fly for safety to the mountains, assigning as a\r\nreason, that they are fearful, after the shock, that the sea will again\r\nreturn and deluge the world.[692]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the tendency of writers in his day to refer all\r\ntraditionary inundations to one remote period, Molina remarks that this\r\nflood of the Araucanians \"was probably very different from that of\r\nNoah.\" We have, indeed, no means of conjecturing how long this same\r\ntribe had flourished in Chili, but we can scarcely doubt, that if its\r\nexperience reached back even for three or four centuries, several\r\ninroads of the ocean must have occurred within that period. But the\r\nmemory of a succession of physical events, similar in kind, though\r\ndistinct in time, can never be preserved by a people destitute of\r\nwritten annals. Before two or three generations have passed away all\r\ndates are forgotten, and even the events themselves, unless they have\r\ngiven origin to some customs, or religious rites and ceremonies.\r\nOftentimes the incidents of many different earthquakes and floods become\r\nblended together in the same narrative; and in such cases the single\r\ncatastrophe is described in terms so exaggerated, or is so disguised by\r\nmythological fictions, as to be utterly valueless to the antiquary or\r\nphilosopher.\r\n\r\n_Proofs of elevation of twenty-four feet._--During a late survey of\r\nConception Bay, Captain Beechey and Sir E. Belcher discovered that the\r\nancient harbor, which formerly admitted all large merchant vessels which\r\nwent round the Cape, is now occupied by a reef of sandstone, certain\r\npoints of which project above the sea at low water, the greater part\r\nbeing very shallow. A tract of a mile and a half in length, where,\r\naccording to the report of the inhabitants, the water was formerly four\r\nor five fathoms deep, is now a shoal; consisting, as our hydrographers\r\nfound, of hard sandstone, so that it cannot be supposed to have been\r\nformed by recent deposits of the river Biobio, an arm of which carries\r\ndown loose micaceous sand into the same bay.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible at this distance of time to affirm that the bed of the\r\nsea was uplifted at once to the height of twenty-four feet, during the\r\nsingle earthquake of 1751, because other movements may have occurred\r\nsubsequently; but it is said, that ever since the shock of 1751, no\r\nvessels have been able to approach within a mile and a half of the\r\nancient port of Penco. (See Map, p. 455.) In proof of the former\r\nelevation of the coast near Penco our surveyors found above high-water\r\nmark an enormous bed of shells of the same species as those now living\r\nin the bay, filled with micaceous sand like that which the Biobio now\r\nconveys to the bay. These shells, as well as others, which cover the\r\nadjoining hills of mica-schist to the height of several hundred feet,\r\nhave lately been examined by experienced conchologists in London, and\r\nidentified with those taken at the same time in a living state from the\r\nbay and its neighborhood.[693]\r\n\r\nUlloa, therefore, was perfectly correct in his statement that, at\r\nvarious heights above the sea between Talcahuano and Conception, \"mines\r\nwere found of various sorts of shells used for lime of the very same\r\nkinds as those found in the adjoining sea.\" Among them he mentions the\r\ngreat mussel called Choros, and two others which he describes. Some of\r\nthese, he says, are entire, and others broken; they occur at the bottom\r\nof the sea, in four, six, ten, or twelve fathom water, where they adhere\r\nto a sea-plant called Cochayuyo. They are taken in dredges, and have no\r\nresemblance to those found on the shore or in shallow water; yet beds of\r\nthem occur at various heights on the hills. \"I was the more pleased with\r\nthe sight,\" he adds, \"as it appeared to me a convincing proof of the\r\nuniversality of the deluge, although I am not ignorant that some have\r\nattributed their position to other causes.\"[694] It has, however, been\r\nascertained that the foundation of the Castle of Penco was so low in\r\n1835, or at so inconsiderable an elevation above the highest spring\r\ntides, as to discountenance the idea of any permanent upheaval in modern\r\ntimes, on the site of that ancient port; but no exact measurements or\r\nlevellings appear as yet to have been made to determine this point,\r\nwhich is the more worthy of investigation, because it may throw some\r\nlight on an opinion often promulgated of late years, that there is a\r\ntendency in the Chilian coast, after each upheaval, to sink gradually\r\nand return towards its former position.\r\n\r\n_Peru_, 1746.--Peru was visited, on the 28th of October, 1746, by a\r\ntremendous earthquake. In the first twenty-four hours, two hundred\r\nshocks were experienced. The ocean twice retired and returned\r\nimpetuously upon the land: Lima was destroyed, and part of the coast\r\nnear Callao was converted into a bay: four other harbors, among which\r\nwere Cavalla and Guanape, shared the same fate. There were twenty-three\r\nships and vessels, great and small, in the harbor of Callao, of which\r\nnineteen were sunk; and the other four, among which was a frigate called\r\nSt. Fermin, were carried by the force of the waves to a great distance\r\nup the country, and left on dry ground at a considerable height above\r\nthe sea. The number of inhabitants in this city amounted to four\r\nthousand. Two hundred only escaped, twenty-two of whom were saved on a\r\nsmall fragment of the fort of Vera Cruz, which remained as the only\r\nmemorial of the town after this dreadful inundation. Other portions of\r\nits site were completely covered with heaps of sand and gravel.\r\n\r\nA volcano in Lucanas burst forth the same night, and such quantities of\r\nwater descended from the cone that the whole country was overflowed; and\r\nin the mountain near Pataz, called Conversiones de Caxamarquilla,\r\nthree other volcanoes burst out, and frightful torrents of water swept\r\ndown their sides.[695]\r\n\r\nThere are several records of prior convulsions in Peru, accompanied by\r\nsimilar inroads in the sea, one of which happened fifty-nine years\r\nbefore (in 1687), when the ocean, according to Ulloa, first retired and\r\nthen returned in a mountainous wave, overwhelming Callao and its\r\nenvirons, with the miserable inhabitants.[696] This same wave, according\r\nto Lionel Wafer, carried ships a league into the country, and drowned\r\nman and beast for fifty leagues along the shore.[697] Inundations of\r\nstill earlier dates are carefully recorded by Ulloa, Wafer, Acosta, and\r\nvarious writers, who describe them as having expended their chief fury,\r\nsome on one part of the coast and some on another.\r\n\r\nBut all authentic accounts cease when we ascend to the era of the\r\nconquest of Peru by the Spaniards. The ancient Peruvians, although far\r\nremoved from barbarism, were without written annals, and therefore\r\nunable to preserve a distinct recollection of a long series of natural\r\nevents. They had, however, according to Antonio de Herrera, who, in the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century, investigated their antiquities, a\r\ntradition, \"that many years before the reign of the Incas, at a time\r\nwhen the country was very populous, there happened a great flood; the\r\nsea breaking out beyond its bounds, so that the land was covered with\r\nwater and all the people perished. To this the Guacas, inhabiting the\r\nvale of Xausca, and the natives of Chiquito, in the province of Callao,\r\nadd that some persons remained in the hollows and caves of the highest\r\nmountains, who again peopled the land. Others of the mountain people\r\naffirm that all perished in the deluge, only six persons being saved on\r\na float, from whom descended all the inhabitants of that country.\"[698]\r\n\r\nOn the mainland near Lima, and on the neighboring island of San Lorenzo,\r\nMr. Darwin found proofs that the ancient bed of the sea had been raised\r\nto the height of more than eighty feet above water within the human\r\nepoch, strata having been discovered at that altitude, containing pieces\r\nof cotton thread and plaited rush, together with sea-weed and marine\r\nshells.[699] The same author learnt from Mr. Gill, a civil engineer,\r\nthat he discovered in the interior near Lima, between Casma and Huaraz,\r\nthe dried-up channel of a large river, sometimes worn through solid\r\nrock, which, instead of continually ascending towards its source, has,\r\nin one place, a steep downward slope in that direction, for a ridge or\r\nline of hills has been uplifted directly across the bed of the stream,\r\nwhich is now arched. By these changes the water has been turned into\r\nsome other course; and a district, once fertile, and still covered with\r\nruins, and bearing the marks of ancient cultivation, has been converted\r\ninto a desert.[700]\r\n\r\n_Java_, 1699.--On the 5th of January, 1699, a terrible earthquake\r\nvisited Java, and no less than 208 considerable shocks were reckoned.\r\nMany houses in Batavia were overturned, and the flame and noise of a\r\nvolcanic eruption were seen and heard in that city, which were\r\nafterwards found to proceed from Mount Salek,[701] a volcano six days'\r\njourney distant. Next morning the Batavian river, which has its rise\r\nfrom that mountain, became very high and muddy, and brought down\r\nabundance of bushes and trees, half burnt. The channel of the river\r\nbeing stopped up, the water overflowed the country round the gardens\r\nabout the town, and some of the streets, so that fishes lay dead in\r\nthem. All the fish in the river, except the carps, were killed by the\r\nmud and turbid water. A great number of drowned buffaloes, tigers,\r\nrhinoceroses, deer, apes, and other wild beasts, were brought down by\r\nthe current; and, \"notwithstanding,\" observes one of the writers, \"that\r\na crocodile is amphibious, several of them were found dead among the\r\nrest.\"[702]\r\n\r\nIt is stated that seven hills bounding the river sank down; by which is\r\nmerely meant, as by similar expressions in the description of the\r\nCalabrian earthquakes, seven great landslips. These hills, descending\r\nsome from one side of the valley and some from the other, filled the\r\nchannel, and the waters then finding their way under the mass, flowed\r\nout thick and muddy. The Tangaran river was also dammed up by nine\r\nhills, and in its channel were large quantities of drift trees. Seven of\r\nits tributaries also are said to have been \"covered up with earth.\" A\r\nhigh tract of forest land, between the two great rivers before\r\nmentioned, is described as having been changed into an open country,\r\ndestitute of trees, the surface being spread over with fine red clay.\r\nThis part of the account may, perhaps, merely refer to the sliding down\r\nof woody tracts into the valleys, as happened to so many extensive\r\nvineyards and olive-grounds in Calabria, in 1783. The close packing of\r\nlarge trees in the Batavian river is represented as very remarkable, and\r\nit attests in a striking manner the destruction of soil bordering the\r\nvalleys which had been caused by floods and landslips.[703]\r\n\r\n_Quito_, 1698.--In Quito, on the 19th of July, 1698, during an\r\nearthquake, a great part of the crater and summit of the volcano\r\nCarguairazo fell in, and a stream of water and mud issued from the\r\nbroken sides of the hill.[704]\r\n\r\n_Sicily_, 1693.--Shocks of earthquakes spread over all Sicily in 1693,\r\nand on the 11th of January the city of Catania and forty-nine other\r\nplaces were levelled to the ground, and about one hundred thousand\r\npeople killed. The bottom of the sea, says Vicentino Bonajutus, sank\r\ndown considerably, both in ports, inclosed bays, and open parts of the\r\ncoast, and water bubbled up along the shores. Numerous long fissures of\r\nvarious breadths were caused, which threw out sulphurous water; and one\r\nof them, in the plain of Catania (the delta of the Simeto), at the\r\ndistance of four miles from the sea, sent forth water as salt as the\r\nsea. The stone buildings of a street in the city of Noto, for the length\r\nof half a mile, sank into the ground, and remained hanging on one side.\r\nIn another street, an opening large enough to swallow a man and horse\r\nappeared.[705]\r\n\r\n_Moluccas_, 1693.--The small Isle of Sorea, which consists of one great\r\nvolcano, was in eruption in the year 1693. Different parts of the cone\r\nfell, one after the other, into a deep crater, until almost half the\r\nspace of the island was converted into a fiery lake. Most of the\r\ninhabitants fled to Banda; but great pieces of the mountain continued to\r\nfall down, so that the lake of lava became wider; and finally the whole\r\npopulation was compelled to emigrate. It is stated that, in proportion\r\nas the burning lake increased in size, the earthquakes were less\r\nvehement.[706]\r\n\r\n_Jamaica_, 1692.--In the year 1692, the island of Jamaica was visited by\r\na violent earthquake; the ground swelled and heaved like a rolling sea,\r\nand was traversed by numerous cracks, two or three hundred of which were\r\noften seen at a time, opening and then closing rapidly again. Many\r\npeople were swallowed up in these rents; some the earth caught by the\r\nmiddle, and squeezed to death; the heads of others only appeared above\r\nground; and some were first engulfed, and then cast up again with great\r\nquantities of water. Such was the devastation, that even in Port Royal,\r\nthen the capital, where more houses are said to have been left standing\r\nthan in the whole island besides, three-quarters of the buildings,\r\ntogether with the ground they stood on, sank down with their inhabitants\r\nentirely under water.\r\n\r\n_Subsidence in the harbor._--The large storehouses on the harbor side\r\nsubsided, so as to be twenty-four, thirty-six, and forty-eight feet\r\nunder water; yet many of them appear to have remained standing, for it\r\nis stated that, after the earthquake, the mast-heads of several ships\r\nwrecked in the harbor, together with the chimney-tops of houses, were\r\njust seen projecting above the waves. A tract of land round the town,\r\nabout a thousand acres in extent, sank down in less than one minute,\r\nduring the first shock, and the sea immediately rolled in. The Swan\r\nfrigate, which was repairing in the wharf, was driven over the tops of\r\nmany buildings, and then thrown upon one of the roofs, through which it\r\nbroke. The breadth of one of the streets is said to have been doubled by\r\nthe earthquake.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir H. De la Beche, the part of Port Royal described as\r\nhaving sunk was built upon newly formed land, consisting of sand, in\r\nwhich piles had been driven; and the _settlement_ of this loose sand,\r\ncharged with the weight of heavy houses, may, he suggests, have given\r\nrise to the subsidence alluded to.[707]\r\n\r\nThere have undoubtedly been instances in Calabria and elsewhere of\r\nslides of land on which the houses have still remained standing; and it\r\nis possible that such may have been the case at Port Royal. The fact at\r\nleast of submergence is unquestionable, for I was informed by the late\r\nAdmiral Sir Charles Hamilton that he frequently saw the submerged houses\r\nof Port Royal in the year 1780, in that part of the harbor which lies\r\nbetween the town and the usual anchorage of men-of-war. Bryan Edwards\r\nalso says, in his history of the West Indies, that in 1793 the _ruins_\r\nwere visible in clear weather from the boats which sailed over\r\nthem.[708] Lastly, Lieutenant B. Jeffery, R. N., tells me that, being\r\nengaged in a survey between the years 1824 and 1835, he repeatedly\r\nvisited the site in question, where the depth of the water is from four\r\nto six fathoms, and whenever there was but little wind perceived\r\ndistinct traces of houses. He saw these more clearly when he used the\r\ninstrument called the \"diver's eye,\" which is let down below the ripple\r\nof the wave.[709]\r\n\r\nAt several thousand places in Jamaica the earth is related to have\r\nopened. On the north of the island several plantations, with their\r\ninhabitants, were swallowed up, and a lake appeared in their place,\r\ncovering above a thousand acres, which afterwards dried up, leaving\r\nnothing but sand and gravel, without the least sign that there had ever\r\nbeen a house or a tree there. Several tenements at Yallows were buried\r\nunder land-slips; and one plantation was removed half a mile from its\r\nplace, the crops continuing to grow upon it uninjured. Between Spanish\r\nTown and Sixteen-mile Walk, the high and perpendicular cliffs bounding\r\nthe river fell in, stopped the passage of the river and flooded the\r\nlatter place for nine days, so that the people \"concluded it had been\r\nsunk as Port Royal was.\" But the flood at length subsided, for the river\r\nhad found some new passage at a great distance.\r\n\r\n_Mountains shattered._--The Blue and other of the highest mountains are\r\ndeclared to have been strangely torn and rent. They appeared shattered\r\nand half-naked, no longer affording a fine green prospect, as before,\r\nbut stripped of their woods and natural verdure. The rivers on these\r\nmountains first ceased to flow for about twenty-four hours, and then\r\nbrought down into the sea, at Port Royal and other places, several\r\nhundred thousand tons of timber, which looked like floating islands on\r\nthe ocean. The trees were in general barked, most of their branches\r\nhaving been torn off in the descent. It is particularly remarked in\r\nthis, as in the narratives of so many earthquakes, that fish were taken\r\nin great numbers on the coast during the shocks. The correspondents of\r\nSir Hans Sloane, who collected with care the accounts of eye-witnesses\r\nof the catastrophe, refer constantly to _subsidences_, and some supposed\r\nthe whole of Jamaica to have sunk down.[710]\r\n\r\n_Reflections on the amount of change in the last one hundred and sixty\r\nyears._--I have now only enumerated some few of the earthquakes of the\r\nlast 160 years, respecting which facts illustrative of geological\r\ninquiries are on record. Even if my limits permitted, it would be an\r\nunprofitable task to examine all the obscure and ambiguous narratives\r\nof similar events of earlier epochs; although, if the places were now\r\nexamined by geologists well practised in the art of interpreting the\r\nmonuments of physical changes, many events which have happened within\r\nthe historical era might doubtless be still determined with precision.\r\nIt must not be imagined that, in the above sketch of the occurrences of\r\na short period, I have given an account of all, or even the greater\r\npart, of the mutations which the earth has undergone by the agency of\r\nsubterranean movements. Thus, for example, the earthquake of Aleppo, in\r\nthe present century, and of Syria, in the middle of the eighteenth,\r\nwould doubtless have afforded numerous phenomena, of great geological\r\nimportance, had those catastrophes been described by scientific\r\nobservers. The shocks in Syria in 1759, were protracted for three\r\nmonths, throughout a space of ten thousand square leagues: an area\r\ncompared to which that of the Calabrian earthquake in 1783 was\r\ninsignificant. Accon, Saphat, Balbeck, Damascus, Sidon, Tripoli, and\r\nmany other places, were almost entirely levelled to the ground. Many\r\nthousands of the inhabitants perished in each; and, in the valley of\r\nBalbeck alone, 20,000 men are said to have been victims to the\r\nconvulsion. In the absence of scientific accounts, it would be as\r\nirrelevant to our present purpose to enter into a detailed account of\r\nsuch calamities, as to follow the track of an invading army, to\r\nenumerate the cities burnt or rased to the ground, and reckon the number\r\nof individuals who perished by famine or the sword.\r\n\r\n_Deficiency of historical records._--If such, then, be the amount of\r\nascertained changes in the last 160 years, notwithstanding the extreme\r\ndeficiency of our records during that brief period, how important must\r\nwe presume the physical revolutions to have been in the course of thirty\r\nor forty centuries, during which some countries habitually convulsed by\r\nearthquakes have been peopled by civilized nations! Towns engulfed\r\nduring one earthquake may, by repeated shocks, have sunk to great depths\r\nbeneath the surface, while the ruins remain as imperishable as the\r\nhardest rocks in which they are inclosed. Buildings and cities,\r\nsubmerged, for a time, beneath seas or lakes, and covered with\r\nsedimentary deposits, must, in some places, have been re-elevated to\r\nconsiderable heights above the level of the ocean. The signs of these\r\nevents have, probably, been rendered visible by subsequent mutations, as\r\nby the encroachments of the sea upon the coast, by deep excavations made\r\nby torrents and rivers, by the opening of new ravines, and chasms, and\r\nother effects of natural agents, so active in districts agitated by\r\nsubterranean movements.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked why, if such wonderful monuments exist, so few have\r\nhitherto been brought to light, we reply--because they have not been\r\nsearched for. In order to rescue from oblivion the memorials of former\r\noccurrences, the inquirer must know what he may reasonably expect to\r\ndiscover, and under what peculiar local circumstances. He must be\r\nacquainted with the action and effect of physical causes, in order to\r\nrecognize, explain, and describe correctly the phenomena when they\r\npresent themselves.\r\n\r\nThe best known of the great volcanic regions, of which the boundaries\r\nwere sketched in the twenty-second chapter, is that which includes\r\nSouthern Europe, Northern Africa, and Central Asia; yet nearly the\r\nwhole, even of this region, must be laid down, in a geological map, as\r\n\"Terra Incognita.\" Even Calabria may be regarded as unexplored, as also\r\nSpain, Portugal, the Barbary States, the Ionian Isles, Asia Minor,\r\nCyprus, Syria, and the countries between the Caspian and Black seas. We\r\nare, in truth, beginning to obtain some insight into one small spot of\r\nthat great zone of volcanic disturbance, the district around Naples; a\r\ntract by no means remarkable for the violence of the earthquakes which\r\nhave convulsed it.\r\n\r\nIf, in this part of Campania, we are enabled to establish that\r\nconsiderable changes in the relative level of land and sea have taken\r\nplace since the Christian era, it is all that we could have expected;\r\nand it is to recent antiquarian and geological research, not to history,\r\nthat we are principally indebted for the information. I shall now\r\nproceed to lay before the reader some of the results of modern\r\ninvestigations in the Bay of Baiae and the adjoining coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROOFS OF ELEVATION AND SUBSIDENCE IN THE BAY OF BAIAE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.\r\n\r\nGround plan of the coast of the Bay of Baiae, in the environs of\r\nPuzzuoli.]\r\n\r\n_Temple of Jupiter Serapis._--This celebrated monument of antiquity, a\r\nrepresentation of which is given in the frontispiece,[711] affords in\r\nitself alone, unequivocal evidence that the relative level of land and\r\nsea has changed twice at Puzzuoli since the Christian era; and each\r\nmovement, both of elevation and subsidence, has exceeded twenty feet.\r\nBefore examining these proofs, I may observe, that a geological\r\nexamination of the coast of Baiae, both on the north and south of\r\nPuzzuoli, establishes, in the most satisfactory manner, an elevation, at\r\nno remote period, of more than twenty feet, and, at one point, of more\r\nthan thirty feet; and the evidence of this change would have been\r\ncomplete, if even the temple had, to this day, remained undiscovered.\r\n\r\n_Coast south of Puzzuoli._--If we coast along the shore from Naples to\r\nPuzzuoli, we find, on approaching the latter place, that the lofty and\r\nprecipitous cliffs of indurated tuff, resembling that of which Naples is\r\nbuilt, retire slightly from the sea; and that a low level tract of\r\nfertile land, of a very different aspect, intervenes between the present\r\nsea-beach and what was evidently the ancient line of coast.\r\n\r\nThe inland cliff may be seen opposite the small island of Nisida, about\r\ntwo miles and a half southeast of Puzzuoli (see Map, fig. 40, p. 361),\r\nwhere, at the height of thirty-two feet above the level of the sea, Mr.\r\nBabbage observed an ancient mark, such as might have been worn by the\r\nwaves; and, upon farther examination, discovered that, along that line,\r\nthe face of the perpendicular rock, consisting of very hard tuff, was\r\ncovered with barnacles (_Balanus sulcatus_, Lamk.), and drilled by\r\nboring testacea. Some of the hollows of the lithodomi contained the\r\nshells; while others were filled with the valves of a species of\r\nArea.[712] Nearer to Puzzuoli, the inland cliff is eighty feet high, and\r\nas perpendicular as if it was still undermined by the waves. At its\r\nbase, a new deposit, constituting the fertile tract above alluded to,\r\nattains a height of about twenty feet above the sea; and, since it is\r\ncomposed of regular sedimentary deposits, containing marine shells, its\r\nposition proves that, subsequently to its formation, there has been a\r\nchange of more than twenty feet in the relative level of land and sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.\r\n\r\n_a_, Antiquities on hill S. E. of Puzzuoli (see ground plan, fig. 86).\r\n\r\n_b_, Ancient cliff now inland.\r\n\r\n_c_, Terrace composed of recent submarine deposit.]\r\n\r\nThe sea encroaches on these new incoherent strata; and as the soil is\r\nvaluable, a wall has been built for its protection; but when I visited\r\nthe spot in 1828, the waves had swept away part of this rampart, and\r\nexposed to view a regular series of strata of tuff, more or less\r\nargillaceous, alternating with beds of pumice and lapilli, and\r\ncontaining great abundance of marine shells, of species now common on\r\nthis coast, and amongst them _Cardium rusticum_, _Ostrea edulis_, _Donax\r\ntrunculus_, Lamk., and others. The strata vary from about a foot to a\r\nfoot and a half in thickness, and one of them contains abundantly\r\nremains of works of art, tiles, squares of mosaic pavement of different\r\ncolors, and small sculptured ornaments, perfectly uninjured.\r\nIntermixed with these I collected some teeth of the pig and ox. These\r\nfragments of building occur below as well as above strata containing\r\nmarine shells. Puzzuoli itself stands chiefly on a promontory of the\r\nolder tufaceous formation, which cuts off the new deposit, although I\r\ndetected a small patch of the latter in a garden under the town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.\r\n\r\nVIEW OF BAY OF BAIAE.\r\n\r\n  1.

Mr. Babbage found, on the sixth pier, perforations of\r\nlithodomi four feet above the level of the sea; and, near the\r\ntermination of the mole on the last pier but one, marks of the same, ten\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, together with great numbers of balani\r\nand flustra. The depth of the sea, at a very small distance from most of\r\nthe piers, is from thirty to fifty feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _a_, Remains of Cicero's villa, N. side of Puzzuoli.[714]\r\n  _b_, Ancient cliff now inland.\r\n  _c_, Terrace (called La Starza) composed of recent submarine deposits.\r\n  _d_, Temple of Serapis.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Coast north of Puzzuoli._--If we then pass to the north of Puzzuoli,\r\nand examine the coast between that town and Monte Nuovo, we find a\r\nrepetition of analogous phenomena. The sloping sides of Monte Barbaro\r\nslant down within a short distance of the coast, and terminate in an\r\ninland cliff of moderate elevation, to which the geologist perceives at\r\nonce that the sea must, at some former period, have extended. Between\r\nthis cliff and the sea is a low plain or terrace, called La Starza (_c_,\r\nfig. 89), corresponding to that before described on the southeast of the\r\ntown; and as the sea encroaches rapidly, fresh sections of the strata\r\nmay readily be obtained, of which the annexed is an example.\r\n\r\nSection on the shore north of the town of Puzzuoli:--\r\n\r\n                                                                  Ft.

Horizontal beds of pumice and scoriae, with broken fragments\r\n       of unrolled bricks, bones of animals, and marine shells     1   6\r\n\r\n  3. Beds of lapilli, containing abundance of marine shells,\r\n       principally _Cardium rusticum_, _Donax trunculus_, Lam.,\r\n      _Ostrea edulis_, _Triton cutaceum_, Lam., and\r\n      _Buccinum serratum_, Brocchi, the beds varying in\r\n       thickness from one to eighteen inches                      10   0\r\n\r\n  4. Argillaceous tuff, containing bricks and fragments\r\n       of buildings not rounded by attrition.                      1   6\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thickness of many of these beds varies greatly as we trace them\r\nalong the shore, and sometimes the whole group rises to a greater height\r\nthan at the point above described. The surface of the tract which they\r\ncompose appears to slope gently upwards towards the base of the old\r\ncliffs.\r\n\r\nNow, if such appearances presented themselves on the coast of England, a\r\ngeologist might endeavor to seek an explanation in some local change in\r\nthe set of the tides and currents: but there are scarce any tides in the\r\nMediterranean; and, to suppose the sea to have sunk generally from\r\ntwenty to twenty-five feet since the shores of Campania were covered\r\nwith sumptuous buildings is an hypothesis obviously untenable. The\r\nobservations, indeed, made during modern surveys on the moles and\r\ncothons (docks) constructed by the ancients in various ports of the\r\nMediterranean, have proved that there has been no sensible variation of\r\nlevel in that sea during the last two thousand years.[715]\r\n\r\nThus we arrive, without the aid of the celebrated temple, at the\r\nconclusion, that the recent marine deposit at Puzzuoli was upraised in\r\nmodern times above the level of the sea, and that not only this change\r\nof position, but the accumulation of the modern strata, was posterior to\r\nthe destruction of many edifices, of which they contain the imbedded\r\nremains. If we next examine the evidence afforded by the temple itself,\r\nit appears, from the most authentic accounts, that the three pillars now\r\nstanding erect continued, down to the middle of the last century, almost\r\nburied in the new marine strata (_c_, fig. 89). The upper part of each\r\nprotruding several feet above the surface was concealed by bushes, and\r\nhad not attracted, until the year 1749, the notice of antiquaries; but,\r\nwhen the soil was removed in 1750, they were seen to form part of the\r\nremains of a splendid edifice, the pavement of which was still\r\npreserved, and upon it lay a number of columns of African breccia and of\r\ngranite. The original plan of the building could be traced distinctly:\r\nit was of a quadrangular form, seventy feet in diameter, and the roof\r\nhad been supported by forty-six noble columns, twenty-four of granite\r\nand the rest of marble. The large court was surrounded by apartments,\r\nsupposed to have been used as bathing-rooms; for a thermal spring, still\r\nused for medicinal purposes, issues just behind the building, and the\r\nwater of this spring appears to have been originally conveyed by a\r\nmarble duct, still extant, into the chambers, and then across the\r\npavement by a groove an inch or two deep, to a conduit made of Roman\r\nbrickwork, by which it gained the sea.\r\n\r\nMany antiquaries have entered into elaborate discussions as to the deity\r\nto which this edifice was consecrated. It is admitted that, among other\r\nimages found in excavating the ruins, there was one of the god Serapis;\r\nand at Puzzuoli a marble column was dug up, on which was carved an\r\nancient inscription, of the date of the building of Rome 648 (or B. C.\r\n105), entitled \"Lex parieti faciundo.\" This inscription, written in\r\nvery obscure Latin, sets forth a contract, between the municipality of\r\nthe town, and a company of builders who undertook to keep in repair\r\ncertain public edifices, the Temple of Serapis being mentioned amongst\r\nthe rest, and described as being near or towards the sea, \"mare vorsum.\"\r\nSir Edmund Head, after studying, in 1828, the topography and antiquities\r\nof this district, and the Greek, Roman, and Italian writers on the\r\nsubject, informed me, that at Alexandria, on the Nile, the chief seat of\r\nthe worship of Serapis, there was a Serapeum of the same form as this\r\ntemple at Puzzuoli, and surrounded in like manner by chambers, in which\r\nthe devotees were accustomed to pass the night, in the hope of receiving\r\nduring sleep a revelation from the god, as to the nature and cure of\r\ntheir diseases. Hence it was very natural that the priests of Serapis, a\r\npantheistic divinity, who, among other usurpations, had appropriated to\r\nhimself the attributes of Esculapius, should regard the hot spring as a\r\nsuitable appendage to the temple, although the original Serapeum of\r\nAlexandria could boast no such medicinal waters. Signor Carelli[716] and\r\nothers, in objecting to these views, have insisted on the fact, that the\r\nworship of Serapis, which we know prevailed at Rome in the days of\r\nCatullus (in the first century before Christ), was prohibited by the\r\nRoman Senate, during the reign of the Emperor Tiberius. But there is\r\nlittle doubt that, during the reigns of that emperor's successors, the\r\nshrines of the Egyptian god were again thronged by zealous votaries; and\r\nin no place more so than at Puteoli (now Puzzuoli), one of the principal\r\nmarts for the produce of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nWithout entering farther into an inquiry which is not strictly\r\ngeological, I shall designate this valuable relic of antiquity by its\r\ngenerally received name, and proceed to consider the memorials of\r\nphysical changes inscribed on the three standing columns in most legible\r\ncharacters by the hand of Nature. (See Frontispiece.) These pillars,\r\nwhich have been carved each out of a single block of marble, are forty\r\nfeet three inches and a half in height. A horizontal fissure nearly\r\nintersects one of the columns; the other two are entire. They are all\r\nslightly out of the perpendicular, inclining somewhat to the southwest,\r\nthat is, towards the sea.[717] Their surface is smooth and uninjured to\r\nthe height of about twelve feet above their pedestals. Above this is a\r\nzone, about nine feet in height, where the marble has been pierced by a\r\nspecies of marine perforating bivalve--_Lithodomus_, Cuv.[718] The holes\r\nof these animals are pear-shaped, the external opening being minute, and\r\ngradually increasing downwards. At the bottom of the cavities, many\r\nshells are still found, notwithstanding the great numbers that have been\r\ntaken out by visitors; in many the valves of a species of arca, an\r\nanimal which conceals itself in small hollows, occur. The perforations\r\nare so considerable in depth and size, that they manifest a\r\nlong-continued abode of the lithodomi in the columns, for, as the\r\ninhabitant grows older and increases in size, it bores a larger cavity,\r\nto correspond with the increased magnitude of its shell. We must,\r\nconsequently, infer a long-continued immersion of the pillars in\r\nsea-water, at a time when the lower part was covered up and protected by\r\nmarine, fresh-water, and volcanic strata, afterwards to be described,\r\nand by the rubbish of buildings; the highest part, at the same time,\r\nprojecting above the waters, and being consequently weathered, but not\r\nmaterially injured. (See fig. 90, p. 514.)\r\n\r\nOn the pavement of the temple lie some columns of marble, which are also\r\nperforated in certain parts; one, for example, to the length of eight\r\nfeet, while, for the length of four feet, it is uninjured. Several of\r\nthese broken columns are eaten into, not only on the exterior, but on\r\nthe cross fracture, and, on some of them, other marine animals (serpulae,\r\n&c.) have fixed themselves.[719] All the granite pillars are untouched\r\nby lithodomi. The platform of the temple, which is not perfectly even,\r\nwas, when I visited it in 1828, about one foot below high-water mark\r\n(for there are small tides in the bay of Naples); and the sea, which was\r\nonly one hundred feet distant, soaked through the intervening soil. The\r\nupper part of the perforations, therefore, were at least twenty-three\r\nfeet above high-water mark; and it is clear that the columns must have\r\ncontinued for a long time in an erect position, immersed in salt water,\r\nand then the submerged portion must have been upraised to the height of\r\nabout twenty-three feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nBy excavations carried on in 1828, below the marble pavement on which\r\nthe columns stand, another costly pavement of mosaic was found, at the\r\ndepth of about five feet below the upper one (_a_, _b_, fig. 90). The\r\nexistence of these two pavements, at different levels, clearly implies\r\nsome subsidence previously to the building of the more modern temple\r\nwhich had rendered it necessary to construct the new floor at a higher\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.\r\n\r\nTemple of Serapis at its period of greatest depression.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _a b_, Ancient mosaic pavement.\r\n  _c c_, Dark marine incrustation.\r\n  _d d_, First filling up, shower of ashes.\r\n  _e e_, Freshwater calcareous deposit.\r\n  _f f_, Second filling up.\r\n  _A_, Stadium.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen (p. 512) that a temple of Serapis existed long\r\nbefore the Christian era. The change of level just mentioned must have\r\ntaken place some time before the end of the second century, for\r\ninscriptions have been found in the temple, from which we learn that\r\nSeptimius Severus adorned its walls with precious marbles, between the\r\nyears 194 and 211 of our era, and the emperor Alexander Severus\r\ndisplayed the like munificence between the years 222 and 235.[720] From\r\nthat era there is an entire dearth of historical information for a\r\nperiod of more than twelve centuries, except the significant fact that\r\nAlaric and his Goths sacked Puzzuoli in 456, and that Genseric did the\r\nlike in 545, A. D. Yet we have fortunately a series of natural archives\r\nself-registered during the dark ages, by which many events which\r\noccurred in and about the temple are revealed to us. These natural\r\nrecords consist partly of deposits, which envelop the pillars below the\r\nzone of lithodomous perforations, and partly of those which surround the\r\nouter walls of the temple. Mr. Babbage, after a minute examination of\r\nthese, has shown (see p. 507, note) that incrustations on the walls of\r\nthe exterior chambers and on the floor of the building demonstrate that\r\nthe pavement did not sink down suddenly, but was depressed by a gradual\r\nmovement. The sea first entered the court or atrium and mingled its\r\nwaters partially with those of the hot spring. From this brackish medium\r\na dark calcareous precipitate (_c c_, fig. 90) was thrown down, which\r\nbecame, in the course of time, more than two feet thick, including some\r\nserpulae in it. The presence of these annelids teaches us that the water\r\nwas salt or brackish. After this period the temple was filled up with an\r\nirregular mass of volcanic tuff (_d d_, fig. 90), probably derived from\r\nan eruption of the neighboring crater of the Solfatara, to the height of\r\nfrom five to nine feet above the pavement. Over this again a purely\r\nfreshwater deposit of carbonate of lime (_e e_, fig. 90) accumulated\r\nwith an _uneven_ bottom since it necessarily accommodated itself to the\r\nirregular outline of the upper surface of the volcanic shower before\r\nthrown down. The top of the same deposit (a freshwater limestone) was\r\nperfectly even and flat, bespeaking an ancient water level. It is\r\nsuggested by Mr. Babbage that this freshwater lake may have been caused\r\nby the fall of ashes which choked up the channel previously\r\ncommunicating with the sea, so that the hot spring threw down calcareous\r\nmatter in the atrium, without any marine intermixture. To the freshwater\r\nlimestone succeeded another irregular mass of volcanic ashes and rubbish\r\n(_f f_, fig. 90), some of it perhaps washed in by the waves of the sea\r\nduring a storm, its surface rising to ten or eleven feet above the\r\npavement. And thus we arrive at the period of greatest depression\r\nexpressed in the accompanying diagram, when the lower half of the\r\npillars were enveloped in the deposits above enumerated, and the\r\nuppermost twenty feet were exposed in the atmosphere, the remaining or\r\nmiddle portion, about nine feet long, being for years immersed in salt\r\nwater and drilled by perforating bivalves. After this period other\r\nstrata, consisting of showers of volcanic ashes and materials washed in\r\nduring storms, covered up the pillars to the height in some places of\r\nthirty-five feet above the pavement. The exact time when these\r\nenveloping masses were heaped up, and how much of them were formed\r\nduring submergence, and how much after the re-elevation of the temple,\r\ncannot be made out with certainty.\r\n\r\nThe period of deep submergence was certainly antecedent to the close of\r\nthe fifteenth century. Professor James Forbes[721] has reminded us of a\r\npassage in an old Italian writer Loffredo, who says that in 1530, or\r\nfifty years before he wrote, which was in 1580, the sea washed the base\r\nof the hills which rise from the flat land called La Starza, as\r\nrepresented in fig. 90, so that, to quote his words, \"a person might\r\nthen have fished from the site of those ruins which are now called the\r\nstadium\" (A, fig. 90).\r\n\r\nBut we know from other evidence that the upward movement had begun\r\nbefore 1530, for the Canonico Andrea di Jorio cites two authentic\r\ndocuments in illustration of this point. The first, dated Oct. 1503, is\r\na deed written in Italian, by which Ferdinand and Isabella grant to the\r\nUniversity of Puzzuoli a portion of land, \"where the sea is drying up\"\r\n(che va seccando el mare); the second, a document in Latin, dated May\r\n23, 1511, or nearly eight years after, by which Ferdinand grants to the\r\ncity a certain territory around Puzzuoli, where the ground _is dried up_\r\nfrom the sea (desiccatum).[722]\r\n\r\nThe principal elevation, however, of the low tract unquestionably took\r\nplace at the time of the great eruption of Monte Nuovo in 1538. That\r\nevent and the earthquakes which preceded it have been already described\r\n(p. 368); and we have seen that two of the eye-witnesses of the\r\nconvulsion, Falconi and Giacomo di Toledo, agree in declaring that the\r\nsea abandoned a considerable tract of the shore, so that fish were taken\r\nby the inhabitants; and, among other things, Falconi mentions that he\r\nsaw two springs _in the newly discovered ruins_.\r\n\r\nThe flat land, when first upraised, must have been more extensive than\r\nnow, for the sea encroaches somewhat rapidly, both to the north and\r\nsoutheast of Puzzuoli. The coast had, when I examined it in 1828, given\r\nway more than a foot in a twelvemonth; and I was assured, by fishermen\r\nin the bay, that it has lost ground near Puzzuoli, to the extent of\r\nthirty feet, within their memory.\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, very probable that the land rose to a greater height at\r\nfirst before it ceased to move upwards, than the level at which it was\r\nobserved to stand when the temple was rediscovered in 1749, for we learn\r\nfrom a memoir, of Niccolini, published in 1838, that since the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century, the temple of Serapis has subsided more than\r\ntwo feet. That learned architect visited the ruins frequently, for the\r\nsake of making drawings, in the beginning of the year 1807, and was in\r\nthe habit of remaining there throughout the day, yet never saw the\r\npavement overflowed by the sea, except occasionally when the south wind\r\nblew violently. On his return, sixteen years after, to superintend some\r\nexcavations ordered by the king of Naples, he found the pavement covered\r\nby sea-water twice every day at high tide, so that he was obliged to\r\nplace there a line of stones to stand upon. This induced him to make a\r\nseries of observations from Oct. 1822 to July 1838, by which means he\r\nascertained that the ground had been and was sinking, at the average\r\nrate of about seven millimetres a year, or about one inch in four years;\r\nso that, in 1838, fish were caught every day on that part of the\r\npavement where, in 1807, there was never a drop of water in calm\r\nweather.[723]\r\n\r\nOn inquiring still more recently as to the condition of the temple and\r\nthe continuance of the sinking of the ground, I learn from Signor\r\nScacchi in a letter, dated June 1852, that the downward movement has\r\nceased for several years, or has at least become almost inappreciable.\r\nDuring an examination undertaken by him at my request in the summer of\r\nthat year (1852), he observed that the rising tide spread first over the\r\nseaward side of the flat surface of the pedestals of each column\r\n(confirming the fact previously noticed by others, that they are out of\r\nthe perpendicular); and he also remarked that the water gained unequally\r\non the base of each pillar, in such a manner as to prove that they have\r\nneither the same amount of inclination, nor lean precisely in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nFrom what was said before (p. 510), we saw that the marine shells in the\r\nstrata forming the plain called La Starza, considered separately,\r\nestablish the fact of an upheaval of the ground to the height of\r\ntwenty-three feet and upwards. The temple proves much more, because it\r\ncould not have been built originally under water, and must therefore\r\nfirst have sunk down twenty feet at least below the waves, to be\r\nafterwards restored to its original position. Yet if such was the order\r\nof events we ought to meet with other independent signs of a like\r\nsubsidence round the margin of a bay once so studded with buildings as\r\nthe Bay of Baiae. Accordingly memorials of such submergence are not\r\nwanting. About a mile northwest of the temple of Serapis, and about 500\r\nfeet from the shore, are the ruins of a temple of Neptune and others of\r\na temple of the Nymphs, now underwater. The columns of the former\r\nedifice stand erect in five feet of water, their upper portions just\r\nrising to the surface of the sea. The pedestals are doubtless buried in\r\nthe sand or mud; so that, if this part of the bottom of the bay should\r\nhereafter be elevated, the exhumation of these temples might take place\r\nafter the manner of that of Serapis. Both these buildings probably\r\nparticipated in the movement which raised the Starza; but either they\r\nwere deeper under water than the temple of Serapis, or they were not\r\nraised up again to so great a height. There are also two Roman roads\r\nunder water in the bay, one reaching from Puzzuoli to the Lucrine Lake,\r\nwhich may still be seen, and the other near the castle of Baiae (No. 8,\r\nfig. 88, p. 509). The ancient mole, too, of Puzzuoli (No. 4, ibid.)\r\nbefore alluded to, has the water up to a considerable height of the\r\narches; whereas Brieslak justly observes, it is next to certain that the\r\npiers must formerly have reached the surface before the springing of the\r\narches;[724] so that, although the phenomena before described prove that\r\nthis mole has been uplifted ten feet above the level at which it once\r\nstood, it is still evident that it has not yet been restored to its\r\noriginal position.\r\n\r\nA modern writer also reminds us, that these effects are not so local as\r\nsome would have us to believe; for on the opposite side of the Bay of\r\nNaples, on the Sorrentine coast, which, as well as Puzzuoli, is subject\r\nto earthquakes, a road, with some fragments of Roman buildings, is\r\ncovered to some depth by the sea. In the island of Capri, also, which is\r\nsituated some way out at sea, in the opening of the Bay of Naples, one\r\nof the palaces of Tiberius is now covered with water.[725]\r\n\r\nThat buildings should have been submerged, and afterwards upheaved,\r\nwithout being entirely reduced to a heap of ruins, will appear no\r\nanomaly, when we recollect that, in the year 1819, when the delta of the\r\nIndus sank down, the houses within the fort of Sindree subsided beneath\r\nthe waves without being overthrown. In like manner, in the year 1692,\r\nthe buildings round the harbor of Port Royal, in Jamaica, descended\r\nsuddenly to the depth of between thirty and fifty feet under the sea\r\nwithout falling. Even on small portions of land transported to a\r\ndistance of a mile down a declivity, tenements, like those near Mileto,\r\nin Calabria, were carried entire. At Valparaiso buildings were left\r\nstanding in 1822, when their foundations, together with a long tract of\r\nthe Chilian coast, were permanently upraised to the height of several\r\nfeet. It is still more easy to conceive that an edifice may escape\r\nfalling during the upheaval or subsidence of land, if the walls are\r\nsupported on the exterior and interior with a deposit like that which\r\nsurrounded and filled to the height of ten or eleven feet the temple of\r\nSerapis all the time it was sinking, and which enveloped it to more than\r\ntwice that height when it was rising again to its original level.\r\n\r\nWe can scarcely avoid the conclusion, as Mr. Babbage has hinted, \"that\r\nthe action of heat is in some way or other the cause of the phenomena of\r\nthe change of level of the temple. Its own hot spring, its immediate\r\ncontiguity to the Solfatara, its nearness to the Monte Nuovo, the hot\r\nspring at the baths of Nero (No. 6, fig. 88), on the opposite side of\r\nthe Bay of Baiae; the boiling springs and ancient volcanoes of Ischia on\r\none side and Vesuvius on the other, are the most prominent of a\r\nmultitude of facts which point to that conclusion.\"[726] And when we\r\nreflect on the dates of the principal oscillations of level, and the\r\nvolcanic history of the country before described (chap. 23), we seem to\r\ndiscover a connection between each era of upheaval and a local\r\ndevelopment of volcanic heat, and again between each era of depression\r\nand the local quiescence or dormant condition of the subterranean\r\nigneous causes. Thus for example, before the Christian era, when so many\r\nvents were in frequent eruption in Ischia, and when Avernus and other\r\npoints in the Phlegraean Fields were celebrated for their volcanic aspect\r\nand character, the ground on which the temple stood was several feet\r\nabove water. Vesuvius was then regarded as a spent volcano; but when,\r\nafter the Christian era, the fires of that mountain were rekindled,\r\nscarcely a single outburst was ever witnessed in Ischia, or around the\r\nBay of Baiae. Then the temple was sinking. Vesuvius, at a subsequent\r\nperiod, became nearly dormant for five centuries preceding the great\r\noutbreak of 1631 (see p. 374), and in that interval the Solfatara was in\r\neruption A. D. 1198, Ischia in 1302, and Monte Nuovo was formed in 1538.\r\nThen the foundations on which the temple stood were rising again.\r\nLastly, Vesuvius once more became a most active vent, and has been so\r\never since, and during the same lapse of time the area of the temple, so\r\nfar as we know any thing of its history, has been subsiding.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena would agree well with the hypothesis, that when the\r\nsubterranean heat is on the increase, and when lava is forming without\r\nobtaining an easy vent, like that afforded by a great habitual chimney,\r\nsuch as Vesuvius, the incumbent surface is uplifted; but when the heated\r\nrocks below are cooling and contracting, and sheets of lava are slowly\r\nconsolidating and diminishing in volume, then the incumbent land\r\nsubsides.\r\n\r\nSignor Niccolini, when he ascertained in 1838 that the relative levels\r\nof the floor of the temple and of the sea were slowly changing from year\r\nto year, embraced the opinion that it was the sea which was rising. But\r\nSignor Capocci successfully controverted this view, appealing to many\r\nappearances which attest the local character of the movements of the\r\nadjoining country, besides the historical fact that in 1538, when the\r\nsea retired permanently 200 yards from the ancient shore at Puzzuoli,\r\nthere was no simultaneous retreat of the waters from Naples,\r\nCastelamare, and Ischia.[727]\r\n\r\n_Permanence of the ocean's level._--In concluding this subject I may\r\nobserve, that the interminable controversies to which the phenomena of\r\nthe Bay of Baiae gave rise, have sprung from an extreme reluctance to\r\nadmit that the land, rather than the sea, is subject alternately to rise\r\nand fall. Had it been assumed that the level of the ocean was\r\ninvariable, on the ground that no fluctuations have as yet been clearly\r\nestablished, and that, on the other hand, the continents are inconstant\r\nin their level, as has been demonstrated by the most unequivocal proofs\r\nagain and again, from the time of Strabo to our own times, the\r\nappearances of the temple at Puzzuoli could never have been regarded as\r\nenigmatical. Even if contemporary accounts had not distinctly attested\r\nthe upraising of the coast, this explanation should have been proposed\r\nin the first instance as the most natural, instead of being now adopted\r\nunwillingly when all others have failed.\r\n\r\nTo the strong prejudices still existing in regard to the mobility of the\r\nland, we may attribute the rarity of such discoveries as have been\r\nrecently brought to light in the Bay of Baiae and the Bay of Conception.\r\nA false theory, it is well known, may render us blind to facts which are\r\nopposed to our prepossessions, or may conceal from us their true import\r\nwhen we behold them. But it is time that the geologist should, in some\r\ndegree, overcome those first and natural impressions, which induced the\r\npoets of old to select the rock as the emblem of firmness--the sea as\r\nthe image of inconstancy. Our modern poet, in a more philosophical\r\nspirit, saw in the sea \"The image of eternity,\" and has finely\r\ncontrasted the fleeting existence of the successive empires which have\r\nflourished and fallen on the borders of the ocean with its own unchanged\r\nstability.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ------Their decay\r\n    Has dried up realms to deserts:--not so thou,\r\n    Unchangeable, save to thy wild wave's play:\r\n    Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow;\r\n  Such as creation's dawn beheld, thou rollest now.\r\n\r\n  CHILDE HAROLD, Canto iv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nELEVATION AND SUBSIDENCE OF LAND WITHOUT EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Changes in the relative level of land and sea in regions not\r\n    volcanic--Opinion of Celsius that the waters of the Baltic Sea and\r\n    Northern Ocean were sinking--Objections raised to his\r\n    opinion--Proofs of the stability of the sea level in the\r\n    Baltic--Playfair's hypothesis that the land was rising in\r\n    Sweden--Opinion of Von Buch--Marks cut on the rocks--Survey of these\r\n    in 1820--Facility of detecting slight alterations of level on coast\r\n    of Sweden--Shores of the ocean also rising--Area upheaved--Shelly\r\n    deposits of Uddevalla--Of Stockholm, containing fossil shells\r\n    characteristic of the Baltic--Subsidence in south of Sweden--Fishing\r\n    hut buried under marine strata--Upheaval in Sweden not always in\r\n    horizontal planes--Sinking of land in Greenland--Bearing of these\r\n    facts on geology.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now considered the phenomena of volcanoes and earthquakes\r\naccording to the division of the subject before proposed (p. 345), and\r\nhave next to turn our attention to those slow and insensible changes in\r\nthe relative level of land and sea which take place in countries remote\r\nfrom volcanoes, and where no violent earthquakes have occurred within\r\nthe period of human observation. Early in the last century the Swedish\r\nnaturalist, Celsius, expressed his opinion that the waters, both of the\r\nBaltic and Northern Ocean, were gradually subsiding. From numerous\r\nobservations, he inferred that the rate of depression was about fifty\r\nSwedish inches in a century.[728] In support of this position, he\r\nalleged that there were many rocks both on the shores of the Baltic and\r\nthe ocean known to have been once sunken reefs, and dangerous to\r\nnavigators, but which were in his time above water--that the waters of\r\nthe Gulf of Bothnia had been gradually converted into land, several\r\nancient ports having been changed into inland cities, small islands\r\njoined to the continent, and old fishing-grounds deserted as being too\r\nshallow, or entirely dried up. Celsius also maintained, that the\r\nevidence of the change rested not only on modern observations, but on\r\nthe authority of the ancient geographers, who had stated that\r\nScandinavia was formerly an island. This island, he argued, must in the\r\ncourse of centuries, by the gradual retreat of the sea, have become\r\nconnected with the continent; an event which he supposed to have\r\nhappened after the time of Pliny, and before the ninth century of our\r\nera.\r\n\r\nTo this argument it was objected that the ancients were so ignorant of\r\nthe geography of the most northern parts of Europe, that their authority\r\nwas entitled to no weight; and that their representation of Scandinavia\r\nas an island, might with more propriety be adduced to prove the\r\nscantiness of their information, than to confirm so bold an hypothesis.\r\nIt was also remarked that if the land which connected Scandinavia with\r\nthe main continent was laid dry between the time of Pliny and the ninth\r\ncentury, to the extent to which it is known to have risen above the sea\r\nat the latter period, the rate of depression could not have been\r\nuniform, as was pretended; for it ought to have fallen much more rapidly\r\nbetween the ninth and eighteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nMany of the proofs relied on by Celsius and his followers were\r\nimmediately controverted by several philosophers, who saw clearly that a\r\nfall of the sea in any one region could not take place without a general\r\nsinking of the waters over the whole globe: they denied that this was\r\nthe fact, or that the depression was universal, even in the Baltic. In\r\nproof of the stability of the level of that sea, they appealed to the\r\nposition of the island of Saltholm, not far from Copenhagen. This island\r\nis so low, that in autumn and winter it is permanently overflowed; and\r\nit is only dry in summer, when it serves for pasturing cattle. It\r\nappears, from the documents of the year 1280, that Saltholm was then\r\nalso in the same state, and exactly on a level with the mean height of\r\nthe sea, instead of having been about twenty feet under water, as it\r\nought to have been, according to the computation of Celsius. Several\r\ntowns, also, on the shores of the Baltic, as Lubeck, Wismar, Rostock,\r\nStralsund, and others, after six and even eight hundred years, are as\r\nlittle elevated above the sea as at the era of their foundation, being\r\nnow close to the water's edge. The lowest part of Dantzic was no higher\r\nthan the mean level of the sea in the year 1000; and after eight\r\ncenturies its relative position remains exactly the same.[729]\r\n\r\nSeveral of the examples of the gain of land and shallowing of the sea\r\npointed out by Celsius, and afterwards by Linnaeus, who embraced the same\r\nopinions, were ascribed by others to the deposition of sediment at\r\npoints where rivers entered; and, undoubtedly, Celsius had not\r\nsufficiently distinguished between changes due to these causes and such\r\nas would arise if the waters of the ocean itself were diminishing. Many\r\nlarge rivers descending from a mountainous country, at the head of the\r\nGulf of Bothnia, enter the sea charged with sand, mud, and pebbles; and\r\nit was said that in these places the low land had advanced rapidly,\r\nespecially near Torneo. At Piteo also, half a mile had been gained in\r\nforty-five years; at Luleo,[730] no less than a mile in twenty-eight\r\nyears; facts which might all be admitted consistently with the\r\nassumption that the level of the Baltic has remained unchanged, like\r\nthat of the Adriatic, during a period when the plains of the Po and the\r\nAdige have greatly extended their area.\r\n\r\nIt was also alleged that certain insular rocks, once entirely covered\r\nwith water, had at length protruded themselves above the waves, and\r\ngrown, in the course of a century and a half, to be eight feet high. The\r\nfollowing attempt was made to explain away this phenomenon:--In the\r\nBaltic, large erratic blocks, as well as sand and smaller stones which\r\nlie on shoals, are liable every year to be frozen into the ice, where\r\nthe sea freezes to the depth of five or six feet. On the melting of the\r\nsnow in spring, when the sea rises about half a fathom, numerous\r\nice-islands float away, bearing up these rocky fragments so as to convey\r\nthem to a distance; and if they are driven by the waves upon shoals,\r\nthey may convert them into islands by depositing the blocks; if stranded\r\nupon low islands, they may considerably augment their height.\r\n\r\nBrowallius, also, and some other Swedish naturalists, affirmed that some\r\nislands were lower than formerly; and that, by reference to this kind of\r\nevidence, there was equally good reason for contending that the level of\r\nthe Baltic was gradually rising. They also added another curious proof\r\nof the permanency of the water level, at some points at least, for many\r\ncenturies. On the Finland coast were some large pines, growing close to\r\nthe water's edge; these were cut down, and, by counting the concentric\r\nrings of annual growth, as seen in a transverse section of the trunk, it\r\nwas demonstrated that they had stood there for four hundred years. Now,\r\naccording to the Celsian hypothesis, the sea had sunk about fifteen feet\r\nduring that period, in which case the germination and early growth of\r\nthese pines must have been, for many seasons, below the level of the\r\nwater. In like manner it was asserted, that the lower walls of many\r\nancient castles, such as those of Sonderburg and Abo, reached then to\r\nthe water's edge, and must, therefore, according to the theory of\r\nCelsius, have been originally constructed below the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.]\r\n\r\nIn reply to this last argument, Colonel Hallstrom, a Swedish engineer,\r\nwell acquainted with the Finland coast, assured me, that the base of the\r\nwalls of the castle of Abo is now ten feet above the water, so that\r\nthere may have been a considerable rise of the land at that point since\r\nthe building was erected.\r\n\r\nPlayfair, in his \"Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory,\" in 1802,\r\nadmitted the sufficiency of the proofs adduced by Celsius, but\r\nattributed the change of level to the movement of the land, rather than\r\nto a diminution of the waters. He observed, \"that in order to depress or\r\nelevate the absolute level of the sea, by a given quantity, in any one\r\nplace, we must depress or elevate it by the same quantity over the whole\r\nsurface of the earth; whereas no such necessity exists with respect to\r\nthe elevation or depression of the land.\"[731] The hypothesis of the\r\nrising of the land he adds, \"agrees well with the Huttonian theory,\r\nwhich holds, that our continents are subject to be acted upon by the\r\nexpansive forces of the mineral regions; that by these forces they have\r\nbeen actually raised up, and are sustained by them in their present\r\nsituation.[732]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1807, Von Buch, after returning from a tour in Scandinavia,\r\nannounced his conviction, \"that the whole country, from Frederickshall\r\nin Norway to Abo in Finland, and perhaps as far as St. Petersburg, was\r\nslowly and insensibly rising.\" He also suggested \"that Sweden may rise\r\nmore than Norway, and the northern more than the southern part.\"[733] He\r\nwas led to these conclusions principally by information obtained from\r\nthe inhabitants and pilots, and in part by the occurrence of marine\r\nshells of recent species, which he had found at several points on the\r\ncoast of Norway above the level of the sea. He also mentions the marks\r\nset on the rocks. Von Buch, therefore, has the merit of being the first\r\ngeologist who, after a personal examination of the evidence, declared in\r\nfavor of the rise of land in Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nThe attention excited by this subject in the early part of the last\r\ncentury, induced many philosophers in Sweden to endeavor to determine,\r\nby accurate observations, whether the standard level of the Baltic was\r\nreally subject to periodical variations; and under their direction,\r\nlines or grooves, indicating the ordinary level of the water on a calm\r\nday, together with the date of the year, were chiselled out upon the\r\nrocks. In 1820-21, all the marks made before those years were examined\r\nby the officers of the pilotage establishment of Sweden; and in their\r\nreport to the Royal Academy of Stockholm they declared, that on\r\ncomparing the level of the sea at the time of their observations with\r\nthat indicated by the ancient marks, they found that the Baltic was\r\nlower relatively to the land in certain places, but the amount of change\r\nduring equal periods of time had not been everywhere the same. During\r\ntheir survey, they cut new marks for the guidance of future observers,\r\nseveral of which I had an opportunity of examining fourteen years after\r\n(in the summer of 1834), and in that interval the land appeared to me to\r\nhave risen at certain places north of Stockholm four or five inches. I\r\nalso convinced myself, during my visit to Sweden, after conversing with\r\nmany civil engineers, pilots, and fishermen, and after examining some\r\nof the ancient marks, that the evidence formerly adduced in favor of the\r\nchange of level, both on the coasts of Sweden and Finland, was full and\r\nsatisfactory.[734] The alteration of level evidently diminishes as we\r\nproceed from the northern parts of the Gulf of Bothnia towards the\r\nsouth, being very slight around Stockholm. Some writers have indeed\r\nrepresented the rate of depression of the waters at Stockholm as very\r\nconsiderable, because certain houses in that city which are built on\r\npiles have sunk down within the memory of persons still living, so as to\r\nbe out of the perpendicular; and this in consequence of the tops of the\r\npiles giving way and decaying, owing to a fall of the waters which has\r\nexposed them to be alternately wet and dry. The houses alluded to are\r\nsituated on the borders of Lake Maeler, a large lake, the outlet of\r\nwhich joins the Baltic, in the middle of Stockholm. This lake is\r\ncertainly lower than formerly; but the principal cause of the change is\r\nnot the elevation of the land, but the removal of two old bridges built\r\non piles, which formerly obstructed the discharge of the fresh water\r\ninto the sea. Another cause is the opening, in the year 1819, of a new\r\ncanal at Sodertelje, a place south of Stockholm, by means of which a new\r\nline of communication was formed between Lake Maeler and the\r\nBaltic.[735]\r\n\r\nIt will naturally be asked, whether the mean level of a sea like the\r\nBaltic can ever be determined so exactly as to permit us to appreciate a\r\nvariation of level, amounting only to one or two feet. In reply, I may\r\nobserve, that, except near the Cattegat, there are no tides in the\r\nBaltic; and it is only when particular winds have prevailed for several\r\ndays in succession, or at certain seasons when there has been an\r\nunusually abundant influx of river water, or when these causes have\r\ncombined, that this sea is made to rise two or three feet above its\r\nstandard level. The fluctuations due to these causes are nearly the same\r\nfrom year to year; so that the pilots and fishermen believe and\r\napparently with reason, that they can mark a deviation, even of a few\r\ninches, from the ordinary or mean height of the waters.\r\n\r\nThere are, moreover, peculiarities in the configuration of the shores of\r\nNorway and Sweden, which facilitate in a remarkable degree the\r\nappreciation of slight changes in the relative level of land and water.\r\nIt has often been said, that there are two coasts, an inner and an outer\r\none; the inner being the shore of the main land; the outer one, a fringe\r\nof countless rocky islands of all dimensions, called the skar (_shair_).\r\nBoats and small vessels make their coasting voyages within this skar:\r\nfor here they may sail in smooth water, even when the sea without is\r\nstrongly agitated. But the navigation is very intricate, and the pilot\r\nmust possess a perfect acquaintance with the breadth and depth of every\r\nnarrow channel, and the position of innumerable sunken rocks. If on such\r\na coast the land rises one or two feet in the course of half a century,\r\nthe minute topography of the skar is entirely altered. To a stranger,\r\nindeed, who revisits it after an interval of many years, its general\r\naspect remains the same; but the inhabitant finds that he can no longer\r\npenetrate with his boat through channels where he formerly passed, and\r\nhe can tell of countless other changes in the height and breadth of\r\nisolated rocks, now exposed, but once only seen through the clear water.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of gneiss, mica-schist, and quartz are usually very hard on\r\nthis coast, slow to decompose, and, when protected from the breakers,\r\nremaining for ages unaltered in their form. Hence it is easy to mark the\r\nstages of their progressive emergence by the aid of natural and\r\nartificial marks imprinted on them. Besides the summits of _fixed_\r\nrocks, there are numerous erratic blocks of vast size strewed over the\r\nshoals and islands in the skar, which have been probably drifted by ice\r\nin the manner before suggested.[736] All these are observed to have\r\nincreased in height and dimension with the last half century. Some,\r\nwhich were formerly known as dangerous sunken rocks, are now only hidden\r\nwhen the water is highest. On their first appearance, they usually\r\npresent a smooth, bare, rounded protuberance, a few feet or yards in\r\ndiameter; and a single sea-gull often appropriates to itself this\r\nresting-place, resorting there to devour its prey. Similar points, in\r\nthe mean time, have grown to long reefs, and are constantly whitened by\r\na multitude of sea-fowl; while others have been changed from a reef,\r\nannually submerged, to a small islet, on which a few lichens, a\r\nfir-seedling, and a few blades of grass, attest that the shoal has at\r\nlength been fairly changed into dry land. Thousands of wooded islands\r\naround show the great alterations which time can work. In the course of\r\ncenturies also, the spaces intervening between the existing islands may\r\nbe laid dry, and become grassy plains encircled by heights well clothed\r\nwith lofty firs. This last step of the process, by which long fiords and\r\nnarrow channels, once separating wooded islands, are deserted by the\r\nsea, has been exemplified within the memory of living witnesses on\r\nseveral parts of the coast.\r\n\r\nHad the apparent fall of the waters been observed in the Baltic only, we\r\nmight have endeavored to explain the phenomenon by local causes\r\naffecting that sea alone. For instance, the channel by which the Baltic\r\ndischarges its surplus waters into the Atlantic, might be supposed to\r\nhave been gradually widened and deepened by the waves and currents, in\r\nwhich case a fall of the water like that before alluded to in Lake\r\nMaeler, might have occurred. But the lowering of level would in that\r\ncase have been uniform and universal, and the waters could not have sunk\r\nat Torneo, while they retained their former level at Copenhagen. Such an\r\nexplanation is also untenable on other grounds; for it is a fact, as\r\nCelsius long ago affirmed, that the alteration of level extends to the\r\nwestern shores of Sweden, bordering the ocean. The signs of elevation\r\nobserved between Uddevalla and Gothenburg are as well established as\r\nthose on the shores of the Bothnian Gulf. Among the places where they\r\nmay be studied, are the islands of Marstrand and Gulholmen, the\r\nlast-mentioned locality being one of those particularly pointed out by\r\nCelsius.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants there and elsewhere affirm, that the rate of the sinking\r\nof the sea (or elevation of land) varies in different and adjoining\r\ndistricts, being greatest at points where the land is low. But in this\r\nthey are deceived; for they measure the amount of rise by the area\r\ngained, which is most considerable where the land descends with a gentle\r\nslope into the sea. In the same manner, some advocates of the Celsian\r\ntheory formerly appealed to the increase of lands near the mouths of\r\nrivers, not sufficiently adverting to the fact, that if the bed of the\r\nsea is rising, the change will always be most sensible where the bottom\r\nhas been previously rendered shallow; whereas, at a distance from these\r\npoints where the scarped granitic cliffs plunge at once into deep water,\r\na much greater amount of elevation is necessary to produce an equally\r\nconspicuous change.\r\n\r\nAs to the area in northern Europe which is subject to this slow\r\nupheaving movement, we have not as yet sufficient data for estimating it\r\ncorrectly. It seems probable, however, that it reaches from Gothenburg\r\nto Torneo, and from thence to the North Cape, the rate of elevation\r\nincreasing always as we proceed farther northwards. The two extremities\r\nof this line are more than a thousand geographical miles distant from\r\neach other; and as both terminate in the ocean, we know not how much\r\nfarther the motion may be prolonged under water. As to the breadth of\r\nthe tract, its limits are equally uncertain, though it evidently extends\r\nacross the widest parts of the Gulf of Bothnia, and may probably stretch\r\nfar into the interior, both of Sweden and Finland. Now if the elevation\r\ncontinue, a larger part of the Gulf of Bothnia will be turned into land,\r\nas also more of the ocean off the west coast of Sweden between\r\nGothenburg and Uddevalla; and on the other hand, if the change has been\r\ngoing on for thousands of years at the rate of several feet in a\r\ncentury, large tracts of what is now land must have been submarine at\r\nperiods comparatively modern. It is natural therefore to inquire whether\r\nthere are any signs of the recent sojourn of the sea on districts now\r\ninland? The answer is most satisfactory.--Near Uddevalla and the\r\nneighboring coastland, we find upraised deposits of shells belonging to\r\nspecies such as now live in the ocean; while on the opposite or eastern\r\nside of Sweden, near Stockholm, Gefle, and other places bordering the\r\nBothnian Gulf, there are analogous beds containing shells of species\r\ncharacteristic of the Baltic.\r\n\r\nVon Buch announced in 1807, that he had discovered in Norway and at\r\nUddevalla in Sweden, beds of shells of existing species, at considerable\r\nheights above the sea. Since that time, other naturalists have\r\nconfirmed his observation; and, according to Strom, deposits occur at\r\nan elevation of more than 400 feet above the sea in the northern part of\r\nNorway. M. Alex. Brongniart, when he visited Uddevalla, ascertained that\r\none of the principal masses of shells, that of Capellbacken, is raised\r\nmore than 200 feet above the sea, resting on rocks of gneiss, all the\r\nspecies being identical with those now inhabiting the contiguous ocean.\r\nThe same naturalist also stated, that on examining with care the surface\r\nof the gneiss, immediately above the ancient shelly deposit, he found\r\nbarnacles (_balani_) adhering to the rocks, showing that the sea had\r\nremained there for a long time. I was fortunate enough to be able to\r\nverify this observation by finding in the summer of 1834, at Kured,\r\nabout two miles north of Uddevalla, and at the height of more than 100\r\nfeet above the sea, a surface of gneiss newly laid open by the partial\r\nremoval of a mass of shells used largely in the district for making lime\r\nand repairing the roads. So firmly did these barnacles adhere to the\r\ngneiss, that I broke off portions of the rock with the shells attached.\r\nThe face of the gneiss was also incrusted with small zoophytes\r\n(_Cellepora?_ Lam.); but had these or the barnacles been exposed in the\r\natmosphere ever since the elevation of the rocks above the sea, they\r\nwould doubtless have decomposed and been obliterated.\r\n\r\nThe town of Uddevalla (see Map, p. 523) stands at the head of a narrow\r\ncreek overhung by steep and barren rocks of gneiss, of which all the\r\nadjacent country is composed, except in the low grounds and bottoms of\r\nvalleys, where strata of sand, clay, and marl frequently hide the\r\nfundamental rocks. To these newer and horizontal deposits the fossil\r\nshells above mentioned belong, and similar marine remains are found at\r\nvarious heights above the sea on the opposite island of Orust. The\r\nextreme distance from the sea to which such fossils extend is as yet\r\nunknown; but they have been already found at Trollhattan in digging the\r\ncanal there, and still farther inland on the northern borders of Lake\r\nWener, fifty miles from the sea, at an elevation of 200 feet near Lake\r\nRogvarpen.\r\n\r\nTo pass to the Baltic: I observed near its shores at Sodertelje, sixteen\r\nmiles S. W. of Stockholm, strata of sand, clay, and marl, more than 100\r\nfeet high, and containing shells of species now inhabiting the Bothnian\r\nGulf. These consist partly of marine and partly of freshwater species;\r\nbut they are few in number, the brackishness of the water appearing to\r\nbe very unfavorable to the development of testacea. The most abundant\r\nspecies are the common cockle and the common mussel and periwinkle of\r\nour shores (_Cardium edule_, _Mytilus edulis_, and _Littorina\r\nlittorea_), together with a small tellina (_T. Baltica_) and a few\r\nminute univalves allied to _Paludina ulva_. These live in the same water\r\nas a _Lymneus_, a Neritina (_N. fluviatilis_), and some other\r\nfresh-water shells.\r\n\r\nBut the marine mollusks of the Baltic above mentioned, although very\r\nnumerous in individuals, are dwarfish in size, scarcely ever attaining a\r\nthird of the average dimensions which they acquire in the salter waters\r\nof the ocean. By this character alone a geologist would generally be\r\nable to recognize an assemblage of Baltic fossils as distinguished from\r\nthose derived from a deposit in the ocean. The absence also of oysters,\r\nbarnacles, whelks, scallops, limpets (_ostrea_, _balanus_, _buccinum_,\r\n_pecten_, _patella_), and many other forms abounding alike in the sea\r\nnear Uddevalla, and in the fossiliferous deposits of modern date on that\r\ncoast, supplies an additional negative character of the greatest value,\r\ndistinguishing assemblages of Baltic from those of oceanic shells. Now\r\nthe strata containing Baltic shells are found in many localities near\r\nStockholm, Upsala, and Gefle, and will probably be discovered everywhere\r\naround the borders of the Bothnian Gulf; for I have seen similar remains\r\nbrought from Finland, in marl resembling that found near Stockholm. The\r\nutmost distance to which these deposits have yet been traced inland, is\r\non the southern shores of Lake Maeler, at a place seventy miles from the\r\nsea.[737] Hence it appears from the distinct assemblage of fossil shells\r\nfound on the eastern and western coasts of Sweden, that the Baltic has\r\nbeen for a long period separated as now from the ocean, although the\r\nintervening tract of land was once much narrower, even after both seas\r\nhad become inhabited by all the existing species of testacea.\r\n\r\nAs no accurate observations on the rise of the Swedish coast refer to\r\nperiods more remote than a century and a half from the present time, and\r\nas traditional information, and that derived from ancient buildings on\r\nthe coast, do not enable the antiquary to trace back any monuments of\r\nchange for more than five or six centuries, we cannot declare whether\r\nthe rate of the upheaving force is uniform during very long periods. In\r\nthose districts where the fossil shells are found at the height of more\r\nthan 200 feet above the ocean, as at Uddevalla, Orust, and Lake\r\nRogvarpen, the present rate of rise seems less than four feet in a\r\ncentury. Even at that rate it would have required five thousand years to\r\nlift up those deposits. But as the movement is now very different in\r\ndifferent places, it may also have varied much in intensity at different\r\neras.\r\n\r\nWe have, moreover, yet to learn not only whether the motion proceeds\r\nalways at the same rate, but also whether it has been uniformly _in one\r\ndirection_. The level of the land may oscillate; and for centuries there\r\nmay be a depression, and afterwards a re-elevation, of the same\r\ndistrict. Some phenomena in the neighborhood of Stockholm appear to me\r\nonly explicable on the supposition of the alternate rising and sinking\r\nof the ground since the country was inhabited by man. In digging a\r\ncanal, in 1819, at Sodertelje, about sixteen miles to the south of\r\nStockholm, to unite Lake Maeler with the Baltic, marine strata,\r\ncontaining fossil shells of Baltic species, were passed through. At a\r\ndepth of about sixty feet, they came down upon what seems to have been a\r\nburied fishing-hut, constructed of wood in a state of decomposition,\r\nwhich soon crumbled away on exposure to the air. The lowest part,\r\nhowever, which had stood on a level with the sea, was in a more perfect\r\nstate of preservation. On the floor of this hut was a rude fireplace,\r\nconsisting of a ring of stones, and within this were cinders and charred\r\nwood. On the outside lay boughs of the fir, cut as with an axe, with the\r\nleaves or needles still attached. It seems very difficult to explain the\r\nposition of this buried hut, without imagining, as in the case of the\r\ntemple of Serapis (see p. 486), first a subsidence to the depth of more\r\nthan sixty feet, then a re-elevation. During the period of submergence,\r\nthe hut must have become covered over with gravel and shelly marl, under\r\nwhich not only the hut, but several vessels also were found, of a very\r\nantique form, and having their timbers fastened together by wooden pegs\r\ninstead of nails.[738]\r\n\r\nWhether any of the land in Norway is now rising, must be determined by\r\nfuture investigations. Marine fossil shells, of recent species, have\r\nbeen collected from inland places near Drontheim; but Mr. Everest, in\r\nhis \"Travels through Norway,\" informs us that the small island of\r\nMunkholm, which is an insulated rock in the harbor of Drontheim, affords\r\nconclusive evidence of the land having in that region remained\r\nstationary for the last eight centuries. The area of this isle does not\r\nexceed that of a small village, and by an official survey, its highest\r\npoint has been determined to be twenty-three feet above the mean\r\nhigh-water mark, that is, the mean between neap and spring tides. Now,\r\na monastery was founded there by Canute the Great, A. D. 1028, and\r\nthirty-three years before that time it was in use as a common place of\r\nexecution. According to the assumed average rate of rise in Sweden\r\n(about forty inches in a century), we should be obliged to suppose that\r\nthis island had been three feet eight inches below high-water mark when\r\nit was originally chosen as the site of the monastery.\r\n\r\nProfessor Keilhau of Christiania, after collecting the observations of\r\nhis predecessors respecting former changes of level in Norway, and\r\ncombining them with his own, has made the fact of a general change of\r\nlevel at a modern period, that is to say, within the period of the\r\nactual testaceous fauna, very evident. He infers that the whole country\r\nfrom Cape Lindesnaes to Cape North, and beyond that as far as the\r\nfortress of Vardhuus, has been gradually upraised, and on the southeast\r\ncoast the elevation has amounted to more than 600 feet. The marks which\r\ndenote the ancient coast-line are so nearly horizontal that the\r\ndeviation from horizontality, although the measurements have been made\r\nat a great number of points, is too small to be appreciated.\r\n\r\nMore recently (1844), however, it appears from the researches of M.\r\nBravais, member of the French scientific commission of the North, that\r\nin the Gulf of Alten in Finmark, the most northerly part of Norway,\r\nthere are two distinct lines of upraised ancient sea-coast, one above\r\nthe other, which are not parallel, and both of them imply that within a\r\ndistance of fifty miles a considerable slope can be detected in such a\r\ndirection as to show that the ancient shores have undergone a greater\r\namount of upheaval in proportion as we advance inland.[739]\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated, that, in proceeding from the North Cape to\r\nStockholm, the rate of upheaval diminishes from several feet to a few\r\ninches in a century. To the south of Stockholm, the upward movement\r\nceases, and at length in Scania, or the southernmost part of Sweden, it\r\nappears to give place to a movement in an opposite direction. In proof\r\nof this fact, Professor Nilsson observes, in the first place, that there\r\nare no elevated beds of recent marine shells in Scania like those\r\nfarther to the north. Secondly, Linnaeus, with a view of ascertaining\r\nwhether the waters of the Baltic were retiring from the Scanian shore,\r\nmeasured, in 1749, the distance between the sea and a large stone near\r\nTrelleborg. This same stone was, in 1836, a hundred feet nearer the\r\nwater's edge than in Linnaeus's time, or eighty-seven years before.\r\nThirdly, there is also a submerged peat moss, consisting of land and\r\nfreshwater plants, beneath the sea at a point to which no peat could\r\nhave been drifted down by any river. Fourthly, and what is still more\r\nconclusive, it is found that in seaport towns, all along the coast of\r\nScania, there are streets below the high-water level of the Baltic, and\r\nin some cases below the level of the lowest tide. Thus, when the wind is\r\nhigh at Malmo, the water overflows one of the present streets, and some\r\nyears ago some excavations showed an ancient street in the same place\r\neight feet lower, and it was then seen that there had been an artificial\r\nraising of the ground, doubtless in consequence of that subsidence.\r\nThere is also a street at Trelleborg, and another at Skanor, a few\r\ninches below high-water mark, and a street at Ystad is exactly on a\r\nlevel with the sea, at which it could not have been originally built.\r\n\r\nThe inferences deduced from the foregoing facts are in perfect harmony\r\nwith the proofs brought to light by two Danish investigators, Dr. Pingel\r\nand Captain Graah, of the sinking down of part of the west coast of\r\nGreenland, for a space of more than 600 miles from north to south. The\r\nobservations of Captain Graah were made during a survey of Greenland in\r\n1823-24; and afterwards in 1828-29; those by Dr. Pingel were made in\r\n1830-32. It appears from various signs and traditions, that the coast\r\nhas been subsiding for the last four centuries from the firth called\r\nIgaliko, in lat. 60 degrees 43 minutes N. to Disco Bay, extending to\r\nnearly the 69th degree of north latitude. Ancient buildings on low rocky\r\nislands and on the shore of the main land have been gradually submerged,\r\nand experience has taught the aboriginal Greenlander never to build his\r\nhut near the water's edge. In one case the Moravian settlers have been\r\nobliged more than once to move inland the poles upon which their large\r\nboats were set, and the old poles still remain beneath the water as\r\nsilent witnesses of the change.[740]\r\n\r\nThe probable cause of the movements above alluded to, whether of\r\nelevation or depression, will be more appropriately discussed in the\r\nfollowing chapters, when the origin of subterranean heat is considered.\r\nBut I may remark here, that the rise of Scandinavia has naturally been\r\nregarded as a very singular and scarcely credible phenomenon, because no\r\nregion on the globe has been more free within the times of authentic\r\nhistory from violent earthquakes. In common, indeed, with our own island\r\nand with almost every spot on the globe, some movements have been, at\r\ndifferent periods, experienced, both in Norway and Sweden. But some of\r\nthese, as for example during the Lisbon earthquake in 1755, may have\r\nbeen mere vibrations or undulatory movements of the earth's crust\r\nprolonged from a great distance. Others, however, have been sufficiently\r\nlocal to indicate a source of disturbance immediately under the country\r\nitself. Notwithstanding these shocks, Scandinavia has, upon the whole,\r\nbeen as tranquil in modern times, and as free from subterranean\r\nconvulsions, as any region of equal extent on the globe. There is also\r\nanother circumstance which has made the change of level in Sweden appear\r\nanomalous, and has for a long time caused the proofs of the fact to be\r\nreceived with reluctance. Volcanic action, as we have seen, is usually\r\nintermittent: and the variations of level to which it has given rise\r\nhave taken place by starts, not by a prolonged and insensible movement\r\nsimilar to that experienced in Sweden. Yet, as we enlarge our experience\r\nof modern changes, we discover instances in which the volcanic eruption,\r\nthe earthquake, and the permanent rise or fall of land, whether slow or\r\nsudden, are all connected. The union of these various circumstances was\r\nexemplified in the case of the temple of Serapis, described in the last\r\nchapter, and we might derive other illustrations from the events of the\r\npresent century in South America.\r\n\r\nSome writers, indeed, have imagined that there is geological evidence in\r\nNorway, of the sudden upheaval of land to a considerable height at\r\nsuccessive periods, since the era when the sea was inhabited by the\r\nliving species of testacea. They point in proof to certain horizontal\r\nlines of inland cliffs and sea-beaches containing recent shells at\r\nvarious heights above the level of the sea.[741] But these appearances,\r\nwhen truly interpreted, simply prove that there have been long pauses in\r\nthe process of upheaval or subsidence. They mark eras at which the level\r\nof the sea has remained stationary for ages, and during which new strata\r\nwere deposited near the shore in some places, while in others the waves\r\nand currents had time to hollow out rocks, undermine cliffs, and throw\r\nup long ranges of shingle. They undoubtedly show that the movement has\r\nnot been always uniform or continuous, but they do not establish the\r\nfact of any sudden alterations of level.\r\n\r\nWhen we are once assured of the reality of the gradual rise of a large\r\nregion, it enables us to account for many geological appearances\r\notherwise of very difficult explanation. There are large continental\r\ntracts and high table-lands where the strata are nearly horizontal,\r\nbearing no marks of having been thrown up by violent convulsions, nor by\r\na series of movements, such as those which occur in the Andes, and cause\r\nthe earth to be rent open, and raised or depressed from time to time,\r\nwhile large masses are engulfed in subterranean cavities. The result of\r\na series of such earthquakes might be to produce in a great lapse of\r\nages a country of shattered, inclined, and perhaps vertical strata. But\r\na movement like that of Scandinavia would cause the bed of the sea, and\r\nall the strata recently formed in it, to be upheaved so gradually, that\r\nit would merely seem as if the ocean had formerly stood at a higher\r\nlevel, and had slowly and tranquilly sunk down into its present bed.\r\n\r\nThe fact also of a very gradual and insensible elevation of land may\r\nexplain many geological movements of denudation, on a grand scale. If,\r\nfor example, instead of the hard granitic rocks of Norway and Sweden, a\r\nlarge part of the bed of the Atlantic, consisting chiefly of soft\r\nstrata, should rise up century after century, at the rate of about half\r\nan inch, or an inch, in a year, how easily might oceanic currents sweep\r\naway the thin film of matter thus brought up annually within the sphere\r\nof aqueous denudation! The tract, when it finally emerged, might present\r\ntable-lands and ridges of horizontal strata, with intervening valleys\r\nand vast plains, where originally, and during its period of submergence,\r\nthe surface was level and nearly uniform.\r\n\r\nThese speculations relate to superficial changes; but others must be\r\ncontinually in progress in the subterranean regions. The foundations of\r\nthe country, thus gradually uplifted in Sweden, must be undergoing\r\nimportant modifications. Whether we ascribe these to the expansion of\r\nsolid matter by continually increasing heat, or to the liquefaction of\r\nrock, or to the crystallization of a dense fluid, or the accumulation of\r\npent-up gases, in whatever conjectures we indulge, we can never doubt\r\nfor a moment, that at some unknown depth beneath Sweden and the Baltic,\r\nthe structure of the globe is in our own times becoming changed from day\r\nto day, throughout a space probably more than a thousand miles in\r\nlength, and several hundred in breadth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF EARTHQUAKES AND VOLCANOES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Intimate connection between the causes of volcanoes and\r\n    earthquakes--Supposed original state of fusion of the\r\n    planet--Universal fluidity not proved by spheroidal figure of the\r\n    earth--Attempt to calculate the thickness of the solid crust of the\r\n    earth by precessional motion--Heat in mines increasing with the\r\n    depth--Objections to the supposed intense heat of a central\r\n    fluid--Whether chemical changes may produce volcanic heat--Currents\r\n    of electricity circulating in the earth's crust.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will hardly be questioned, after the description before given of the\r\nphenomena of earthquakes and volcanoes, that both of these agents have,\r\nto a certain extent, a common origin; and I may now, therefore, proceed\r\nto inquire into their probable causes. But first, it may be well to\r\nrecapitulate some of those points of relation and analogy which lead\r\nnaturally to the conclusion that they spring from a common source.\r\n\r\nThe regions convulsed by violent earthquakes include within them the\r\nsite of all the active volcanoes. Earthquakes, sometimes local,\r\nsometimes extending over vast areas, often precede volcanic eruptions.\r\nThe subterranean movement and the eruption return again and again, at\r\nirregular intervals of time, and with unequal degrees of force, to the\r\nsame spots. The action of either may continue for a few hours, or for\r\nseveral consecutive years. Paroxysmal convulsions are usually followed,\r\nin both cases, by long periods of tranquillity. Thermal and mineral\r\nsprings are abundant in countries of earthquakes and active volcanoes.\r\nLastly, hot springs situated in districts considerably distant from\r\nvolcanic vents have been observed to have their temperature suddenly\r\nraised, and the volume of their water augmented, by subterranean\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nAll these appearances are evidently more or less connected with the\r\npassage of heat from the interior of the earth to the surface; and where\r\nthere are active volcanoes, there must exist, at some unknown depth\r\nbelow, enormous masses of matter intensely heated, and, in many\r\ninstances, in a constant state of fusion. We have first, then, to\r\ninquire, whence is this heat derived?\r\n\r\nIt has long been a favorite conjecture, that the whole of our planet was\r\noriginally in a state of igneous fusion, and that the central parts\r\nstill retain a great portion of their primitive heat. Some have\r\nimagined, with the late Sir W. Herschel, that the elementary matter of\r\nthe earth may have been first in a gaseous state, resembling those\r\nnebulae which we behold in the heavens, and which are of dimensions so\r\nvast, that some of them would fill the orbits of the remotest planets of\r\nour system. The increased power of the telescope has of late years\r\nresolved the greater number of these nebulous appearances into clusters\r\nof stars, but so long as they were confidently supposed to consist of\r\naeriform matter it was a favorite conjecture that they might, if\r\nconcentrated, form solid spheres; and it was also imagined that the\r\nevolution of heat, attendant on condensation, might retain the materials\r\nof the new globes in a state of igneous fusion.\r\n\r\nWithout dwelling on such speculations, which can only have a distant\r\nbearing on geology, we may consider how far the spheroidal form of the\r\nearth affords sufficient ground for presuming that its primitive\r\ncondition was one of universal fluidity. The discussion of this question\r\nwould be superfluous, were the doctrine of original fluidity less\r\npopular; for it may well be asked, why the globe should be supposed to\r\nhave had a pristine shape different from the present one?--why the\r\nterrestrial materials, when first called into existence, or assembled\r\ntogether in one place, should not have been subject to rotation, so as\r\nto assume at once that form which alone could retain their several parts\r\nin a state of equilibrium?\r\n\r\nLet us, however, concede that the statical figure may be a modification\r\nof some other pre-existing form, and suppose the globe to have been at\r\nfirst a perfect and quiescent sphere, covered with a uniform ocean--what\r\nwould happen when it was made to turn round on its axis with its present\r\nvelocity? This problem has been considered by Playfair in his\r\nIllustrations, and he has decided, that if the surface of the earth, as\r\nlaid down in Hutton's theory, has been repeatedly changed by the\r\ntransportation of the detritus of the land to the bottom of the sea, the\r\nfigure of the planet must in that case, whatever it may have been\r\noriginally, be brought at length to coincide with the spheroid of\r\nequilibrium.[742] Sir John Herschel also, in reference to the same\r\nhypothesis, observes, \"a centrifugal force would in that case be\r\ngenerated, whose general tendency would be to urge the water at every\r\npoint of the surface to _recede_ from the _axis_. A rotation might\r\nindeed be conceived so swift as to flirt the whole ocean from the\r\nsurface, like water from a mop. But this would require a far greater\r\nvelocity than what we now speak of. In the case supposed, the _weight_\r\nof the water would still keep it _on_ the earth; and the tendency to\r\nrecede from the axis _could_ only be satisfied therefore by the water\r\nleaving the poles, and flowing towards the equator; there heaping itself\r\nup in a ridge, and being retained in opposition to its weight or natural\r\ntendency towards the centre by the pressure thus caused. This, however,\r\ncould not take place without laying dry the polar regions, so that\r\nprotuberant land would appear at the poles, and a zone of ocean be\r\ndisposed around the equator. This would be the first or immediate\r\neffect. Let us now see what would afterwards happen if things were\r\nallowed to take their natural course.\r\n\r\n\"The sea is constantly beating on the land, grinding it down, and\r\nscattering its worn-off particles and fragments, in the state of sand\r\nand pebbles, over its bed. Geological facts afford abundant proof that\r\nthe existing continents have all of them undergone this process even\r\nmore than once, and been entirely torn in fragments, or reduced to\r\npowder, and submerged and reconstructed. Land, in this view of the\r\nsubject, loses its attribute of fixity. As a mass it might hold together\r\nin opposition to forces which the water freely obeys; but in its state\r\nof successive or simultaneous degradation, when disseminated through the\r\nwater, in the state of sand or mud, it is subject to all the impulses of\r\nthat fluid. In the lapse of time, then, the protuberant land would be\r\ndestroyed, and spread over the bottom of the ocean, filling up the lower\r\nparts, and tending continually to remodel the surface of the solid\r\nnucleus, in correspondence with the _form of equilibrium_. Thus after a\r\nsufficient lapse of time, in the case of an earth in rotation, the polar\r\nprotuberances would gradually be cut down and disappear, being\r\ntransferred to the equator (as being _then_ the _deepest sea_), till the\r\nearth would assume by degrees the form we observe it to have--that of a\r\nflattened or _oblate_ ellipsoid.\r\n\r\n\"We are far from meaning here to trace the process _by which_ the earth\r\nreally assumed its actual form; all we intend is to show that this is\r\nthe form to which, under a condition of a rotation on its axis, it must\r\n_tend_, and which it would attain even if originally and (so to speak)\r\nperversely constituted otherwise.\"[743]\r\n\r\nIn this passage, the author has contemplated the superficial effects of\r\naqueous causes only; but neither he nor Playfair seem to have followed\r\nout the same inquiry with reference to another part of Hutton's system;\r\nnamely, that which assumes the successive fusion by heat of different\r\nparts of the solid earth. Yet the progress of geology has continually\r\nstrengthened the evidence in favor of the doctrine that local variations\r\nof temperature have melted one part after another of the earth's crust,\r\nand this influence has perhaps extended downwards to the very centre.\r\nIf, therefore, before the globe had assumed its present form, it was\r\nmade to revolve on its axis, all matter to which freedom of motion was\r\ngiven by fusion, must before consolidating have been impelled towards\r\nthe equatorial regions in obedience to the centrifugal force. Thus lava\r\nflowing out in superficial streams would have its motion retarded when\r\nits direction was towards the pole, accelerated when towards the\r\nequator; or if lakes and seas of lava existed beneath the earth's crust\r\nin equatorial regions, as probably now beneath the Peruvian Andes, the\r\nimprisoned fluid would force outwards and permanently upheave the\r\noverlying rocks. The statical figure, therefore, of the terrestrial\r\nspheroid (of which the longest diameter exceeds the shortest by about\r\ntwenty-five miles), may have been the result of gradual and even of\r\nexisting causes, and not of a primitive, universal, and simultaneous\r\nfluidity.[744]\r\n\r\nExperiments made with the pendulum, and observations on the manner in\r\nwhich the earth attracts the moon, have shown that our planet is not an\r\nempty sphere, but, on the contrary, that its interior, whether solid or\r\nfluid, has a higher specific gravity than the exterior. It has also been\r\ninferred, that there is a regular increase in density from the surface\r\ntowards the centre, and that the equatorial protuberance is continued\r\ninwards; that is to say, that layers of equal density are arranged\r\nelliptically, and symmetrically, from the exterior to the centre. These\r\nconclusions, however, have been deduced rather as a consequence of the\r\nhypothesis of primitive and simultaneous fluidity than proved by\r\nexperiment. The inequalities in the moon's motion, by which some have\r\nendeavored to confirm them, are so extremely slight, that the opinion\r\ncan be regarded as little more than a probable conjecture.\r\n\r\nThe mean density of the earth has been computed by Laplace to be about\r\n5-1/2, or more than five times that of water. Now the specific gravity\r\nof many of our rocks is from 2-1/2 to 3, and the greater part of the\r\nmetals range between that density and 21. Hence some have imagined that\r\nthe terrestrial nucleus may be metallic--that it may correspond, for\r\nexample, with the specific gravity of iron, which is about 7. But here a\r\ncurious question arises in regard to the form which materials, whether\r\nfluid or solid, might assume, if subjected to the enormous pressure\r\nwhich must obtain at the earth's centre. Water, if it continued to\r\ndecrease in volume according to the rate of compressibility deduced from\r\nexperiment, would have its density doubled at the depth of ninety-three\r\nmiles, and be as heavy as mercury at the depth of 362 miles. Dr. Young\r\ncomputed that, at the earth's centre, steel would be compressed into\r\none-fourth, and stone into one-eighth of its bulk.[745] It is more than\r\nprobable, however, that after a certain degree of condensation, the\r\ncompressibility of bodies may be governed by laws altogether different\r\nfrom those which we can put to the test of experiment; but the limit is\r\nstill undetermined, and the subject is involved in such obscurity, that\r\nwe cannot wonder at the variety of notions which have been entertained\r\nrespecting the nature and conditions of the central nucleus. Some have\r\nconceived it to be fluid, others solid; some have imagined it to have a\r\ncavernous structure, and have even endeavored to confirm this opinion by\r\nappealing to observed irregularities in the vibrations of the pendulum\r\nin certain countries.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has recently been made by Mr. Hopkins to determine the least\r\nthickness which can be assigned to the solid crust of the globe, if we\r\nassume the whole to have been once perfectly fluid, and a certain\r\nportion of the exterior to have acquired solidity by gradual\r\nrefrigeration. This result he has endeavored to obtain by a new solution\r\nof the delicate problem of the processional motion of the pole of the\r\nearth. It is well known that while the earth revolves round the sun the\r\ndirection of its axis remains very nearly the same, _i. e._ its\r\ndifferent positions in space are all nearly parallel to each other. This\r\nparallelism, however, is not accurately preserved, so that the axis,\r\ninstead of coming exactly into the position which it occupied a year\r\nbefore, becomes inclined to it at a very small angle, but always\r\nretaining very nearly the same inclination to the plane of the earth's\r\norbit. This motion of the pole changes the position of the equinoxes by\r\nabout fifty seconds annually, and always in the same direction. Thus the\r\npole-star, after a certain time, will entirely lose its claim to that\r\nappellation, until in the course of somewhat more than 25,000 years the\r\nearth's axis shall again occupy its present angular position, and again\r\npoint very nearly as now to the pole-star. This motion of the axis is\r\ncalled _precession_. It is caused by the attraction of the sun and moon,\r\nand principally the moon, on the protuberant parts of the earth's\r\nequator; and if these parts were solid to a great depth, the motion thus\r\nproduced would differ considerably from that which would exist if they\r\nwere perfectly fluid, and incrusted over with a thin shell only a few\r\nmiles thick. In other words, the disturbing action of the moon will not\r\nbe the same upon a globe all solid and upon one nearly all fluid, or it\r\nwill not be the same upon a globe in which the solid shell forms\r\none-half of the mass, and another in which it forms only one-tenth.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins has, therefore, calculated the amount of precessional motion\r\nwhich would result if we assume the earth to be constituted as above\r\nstated; _i. e._ fluid internally, and enveloped by a solid shell; and he\r\nfinds that the amount will not agree with the observed motion, unless\r\nthe crust of the earth be of a certain thickness. In calculating the\r\nexact amount some ambiguity arises in consequence of our ignorance of\r\nthe effect of pressure in promoting the solidification of matter at high\r\ntemperatures. The hypothesis least favorable for a great thickness is\r\nfound to be that which assumes the pressure to produce no effect on the\r\nprocess of solidification. Even on this extreme assumption the thickness\r\nof the solid crust must be nearly _four hundred miles_, and this would\r\nlead to the remarkable result that the proportion of the solid to the\r\nfluid part would be as 49 to 51, or, to speak in round numbers, there\r\nwould be nearly as much solid as fluid matter in the globe. The\r\nconclusion, however, which Mr. Hopkins announces as that to which his\r\nresearches have finally conducted him, is thus expressed: \"Upon the\r\nwhole, then, we may venture to assert that the minimum thickness of the\r\ncrust of the globe, which can be deemed consistent with the observed\r\namount of precession, cannot be less than one-fourth or one-fifth of the\r\nearth's radius.\" That is from 800 to 1000 miles.[746]\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked, that this is a _minimum_, and any still _greater_\r\namount would be quite consistent with the actual phenomena; the\r\ncalculations not being opposed to the supposition of the general\r\nsolidity of the entire globe. Nor do they preclude us from imagining\r\nthat great lakes or seas of melted matter may be distributed through a\r\nshell 400 or 800 miles thick, provided they be so inclosed as to move\r\nwith it, whatever motion of rotation may be communicated by the\r\ndisturbing forces of the sun and moon.\r\n\r\n_Central heat._--The hypothesis of internal fluidity calls for the more\r\nattentive consideration, as it has been found that the heat in mines\r\naugments in proportion as we descend. Observations have been made, not\r\nonly on the temperature of the air in mines, but on that of the rocks,\r\nand on the water issuing from them. The mean rate of increase,\r\ncalculated from results obtained in six of the deepest coal mines in\r\nDurham and Northumberland, is 1 degrees Fahr. for a descent of forty-four\r\nEnglish feet.[747] A series of observations, made in several of the\r\nprincipal lead and silver mines in Saxony, gave 1 degrees Fahr. for every\r\nsixty-five feet. In this case, the bulb of the thermometer was\r\nintroduced into cavities purposely cut in the solid rock at depths\r\nvarying from 200 to above 900 feet. But in other mines of the same\r\ncountry, it was necessary to descend thrice as far for each degree of\r\ntemperature.[748]\r\n\r\nA thermometer was fixed in the rock of the Dolcoath mine, in Cornwall,\r\nby Mr. Fox, at the great depth of 1380 feet, and frequently observed\r\nduring eighteen months; the mean temperature was 68 degrees Fahr., that\r\nof the surface being 50 degrees, which gives 1 degrees for every\r\nseventy-five feet.\r\n\r\nKupffer, after an extensive comparison of the results in different\r\ncountries, makes the increase 1 degrees F. for about every thirty-seven\r\nEnglish feet.[749] M. Cordier announces, as the result of his\r\nexperiments and observations on the temperature of the interior of the\r\nearth, that the heat increases rapidly with the depth; but the increase\r\ndoes not follow the same law over the whole earth, being twice or three\r\ntimes as much in one country as in another, and these differences are\r\nnot in constant relation either with the latitudes or longitudes of\r\nplaces.[750] He is of opinion, however, that the increase would not be\r\noverstated at 1 degrees Cent. for every twenty-five metres, or about 1\r\ndegrees F. for every forty-five feet.[751] The experimental well bored\r\nat Grenelle, near Paris, gave about 1 degrees F. for every sixty English\r\nfeet, when they had reached a depth of 1312 feet.\r\n\r\nSome writers have endeavored to refer these phenomena (which, however\r\ndiscordant as to the ratio of increasing heat, appear all to point one\r\nway) to the condensation of air constantly descending from the surface\r\ninto the mines. For the air under pressure would give out latent heat,\r\non the same principle as it becomes colder when rarefied in the higher\r\nregions of the atmosphere. But, besides that the quantity of heat is\r\ngreater than could be supposed to flow from this source, the argument\r\nhas been answered in a satisfactory manner by Mr. Fox, who has shown,\r\nthat in the mines of Cornwall the ascending have generally a higher\r\ntemperature than the descending aerial currents. The difference between\r\nthem was found to vary from 9 degrees to 17 degrees F.; a proof that,\r\ninstead of imparting heat, these currents actually carry off a large\r\nquantity from the mines.[752]\r\n\r\nIf we adopt M. Cordier's estimate of 1 degrees F. for every 45 feet of\r\ndepth as the mean result, and assume, with the advocates of central\r\nfluidity, that the increasing temperature is continued downwards, we\r\nshould reach the ordinary boiling point of water at about two miles\r\nbelow the surface, and at the depth of about twenty-four miles should\r\narrive at the melting point of iron, a heat sufficient to fuse almost\r\nevery known substance. The temperature of melted iron was estimated at\r\n21,000 degrees F., by Wedgwood; but his pyrometer gives, as is now\r\ndemonstrated, very erroneous results. Professor Daniell ascertained that\r\nthe point of fusion is 2786 degrees F.[753]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.\r\n\r\nSection of the earth, in which the breadth of the outer boundary line\r\nrepresents a thickness of 25 miles; the space between the circles,\r\nincluding the breadth of the lines, 200 miles.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Daniell's scale, we ought to encounter the internal\r\nmelted matter before penetrating through a thickness represented by\r\nthat of the outer circular line in the annexed diagram (fig. 92);\r\nwhereas, if the other or less correct scale be adopted, we should meet\r\nwith it at some point between the two circles; the space between them,\r\ntogether with the lines themselves, representing a crust of 200 miles in\r\ndepth. In either case, we must be prepared to maintain that a\r\ntemperature many times greater than that sufficient to melt the most\r\nrefractory substances known to us, is sustained at the centre of the\r\nglobe; while a comparatively thin crust, resting upon the fluid, remains\r\nunmelted; or is even, according to M. Cordier, increasing in thickness,\r\nby the continual addition of new internal layers solidified during the\r\nprocess of refrigeration.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical calculations of Fourier, on the passage of heat through\r\nconducting bodies, have been since appealed to in support of these\r\nviews; for he has shown that it is compatible with theory that the\r\npresent temperature of the surface might coexist with an intense heat at\r\na certain depth below. But his reasoning seems to be confined to the\r\nconduction of heat through solid bodies; and the conditions of the\r\nproblem are wholly altered when we reason about a fluid nucleus, as we\r\nmust do if it be assumed that the heat augments from the surface to the\r\ninterior, according to the rate observed in mines. For when the heat of\r\nthe lower portion of a fluid is increased, a circulation begins\r\nthroughout the mass, by the ascent of hotter, and the descent of colder\r\ncurrents. And this circulation, which is quite distinct from the mode in\r\nwhich heat is propagated through solid bodies, must evidently occur in\r\nthe supposed central ocean, if the laws of fluids and of heat are the\r\nsame there as upon the surface.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Daniell's experiments for obtaining a measure of the heat of\r\nbodies at their point of fusion, he invariably found that it was\r\nimpossible to raise the heat of a large crucible of melted iron, gold,\r\nor silver, a single degree beyond the melting point, so long as a bar of\r\nthe respective metals was kept immersed in the fluid portions. So in\r\nregard to other substances, however great the quantities fused, their\r\ntemperature could not be raised while any solid pieces immersed in them\r\nremained unmelted; every accession of heat being instantly absorbed\r\nduring their liquefaction. These results are, in fact, no more than the\r\nextension of a principle previously established, that so long as a\r\nfragment of ice remains in water, we cannot raise the temperature of the\r\nwater above 32 degrees F.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the heat of the earth's centre amount to 450,000 degrees F.,\r\nas M. Cordier deems highly probable, that is to say, about twenty times\r\nthe heat of melted iron, even according to Wedgwood's scale, and upwards\r\nof 160 times according to the improved pyrometer, it is clear that the\r\nupper parts of the fluid mass could not long have a temperature only\r\njust sufficient to melt rocks. There must be a continual tendency\r\ntowards a uniform heat; and until this were accomplished, by the\r\ninterchange of portions of fluid of different densities, the surface\r\ncould not begin to consolidate. Nor, on the hypothesis of primitive\r\nfluidity, can we conceive any crust to have been formed until _the\r\nwhole_ planet had cooled down to about the temperature of incipient\r\nfusion.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be objected that hydrostatic pressure would prevent a tendency\r\nto equalization of temperature; for, as far as observations have yet\r\nbeen made, it is found that the waters of deep lakes and seas are\r\ngoverned by the same laws as a shallow pool; and no experiments indicate\r\nthat solids resist fusion under high pressure. The arguments, indeed,\r\nnow controverted, always proceed on the admission that the internal\r\nnucleus is in a state of fusion.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that we may stand upon the hardened surface of a\r\nlava-current while it is still in motion,--nay, may descend into the\r\ncrater of Vesuvius after an eruption, and stand on the scoriae while\r\nevery crevice shows that the rock is red-hot two or three feet below us;\r\nand at a somewhat greater depth, all is, perhaps, in a state of fusion.\r\nMay not, then, a much more intense heat be expected at the depth of\r\nseveral hundred yards, or miles? The answer is,--that until a great\r\nquantity of heat has been given off, either by the emission of lava, or\r\nin a latent form by the evolution of steam and gas, the melted matter\r\ncontinues to boil in the crater of a volcano. But ebullition ceases when\r\nthere is no longer a sufficient supply of heat from below, and then a\r\ncrust of lava may form on the top, and showers of scoriae may then\r\ndescend upon the surface, and remain unmelted. If the internal heat be\r\nraised again, ebullition will recommence, and soon fuse the superficial\r\ncrust. So in the case of the moving current, we may safely assume that\r\nno part of the liquid beneath the hardened surface is much above the\r\ntemperature sufficient to retain it in a state of fluidity.\r\n\r\nIt may assist us in forming a clearer view of the doctrine now\r\ncontroverted, if we consider what would happen were a globe of\r\nhomogeneous composition placed under circumstances analogous, in regard\r\nto the distribution of heat, to those above stated. If the whole planet,\r\nfor example, were composed of water covered with a spheroidal crust of\r\nice fifty miles thick, and with an interior ocean having a central heat\r\nabout two hundred times that of the melting point of ice, or 6400\r\ndegrees F.; and if, between the surface and the centre, there was every\r\nintermediate degree of temperature between that of melting ice and that\r\nof the central nucleus--could such a state of things last for a moment?\r\nIf it must be conceded, in this case, that the whole spheroid would be\r\ninstantly in a state of violent ebullition, that the ice (instead of\r\nbeing strengthened annually by new internal layers) would soon melt, and\r\nform part of an atmosphere of steam--on what principle can it he\r\nmaintained that analogous effects would not follow, in regard to the\r\nearth, under the conditions assumed in the theory of central heat?[754]\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Cordier admits that there must be tides in the internal melted ocean;\r\nbut their effect, he says, has become feeble, although originally, when\r\nthe fluidity of the globe was perfect, \"the rise and fall of these\r\nancient land tides could not have been less than from thirteen to\r\nsixteen feet.\" Now, granting for a moment, that these tides have become\r\nso feeble as to be incapable of causing the fissured shell of the earth\r\nto be first uplifted and then depressed every six hours, still may we\r\nnot ask whether, during eruptions, the lava, which is supposed to\r\ncommunicate with a great central ocean, would not rise and fall sensibly\r\nin a crater such as Stromboli, where there is always melted matter in a\r\nstate of ebullition?\r\n\r\n_Whether chemical changes may produce volcanic heat._--Having now\r\nexplained the reasons which have induced me to question the hypothesis\r\nof central heat as the primary source of volcanic action, it remains to\r\nconsider what has been termed the chemical theory of volcanoes. It is\r\nwell known that many, perhaps all, of the substances of which the earth\r\nis composed are continually undergoing chemical changes. To what depth\r\nthese processes may be continued downwards must, in a great degree, be\r\nmatter of conjecture; but there is no reason to suspect that, if we\r\ncould descend to a great distance from the surface, we should find\r\nelementary substances differing essentially from those with which we are\r\nacquainted.\r\n\r\nAll the solid, fluid, and gaseous bodies known to us consist of a very\r\nsmall number of these elementary substances variously combined: the\r\ntotal number of elements at present known is less than sixty; and not\r\nhalf of these enter into the composition of the more abundant inorganic\r\nproductions. Some portions of such compounds are daily undergoing\r\ndecomposition, and their constituent parts being set free are passing\r\ninto new combinations. These processes are by no means confined to\r\nminerals at the earth's surface, and are very often accompanied by the\r\nevolution of heat, which is intense in proportion to the rapidity of the\r\ncombinations. At the same time there is a development of electricity.\r\n\r\nThe spontaneous combustion of beds of bituminous shale, and of refuse\r\ncoal thrown out of mines, is generally due to the decomposition of\r\npyrites; and it is the contact of air and water which brings about the\r\nchange. Heat results from the oxidation of the sulphur and iron, though\r\non what principle heat is generated, when two or more bodies having a\r\nstrong affinity for each other unite suddenly, is wholly unexplained.\r\n\r\n_Electricity a source of volcanic heat._--It has already been stated,\r\nthat chemical changes develop electricity; which, in its turn, becomes a\r\npowerful disturbing cause. As a chemical agent, says Davy, its silent\r\nand slow operation in the economy of nature is much more important than\r\nits grand and impressive operation in lightning and thunder. It may be\r\nconsidered, not only as directly producing an infinite variety of\r\nchanges, but as influencing almost all which take place; it would seem,\r\nindeed, that chemical attraction itself is only a peculiar form of the\r\nexhibition of electrical attraction.[755]\r\n\r\nNow that it has been demonstrated that magnetism and electricity are\r\nalways associated, and are perhaps only different conditions of the same\r\npower, the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism have become of no ordinary\r\ninterest to the geologist. Soon after the first great discoveries of\r\nOersted in electro-magnetism, Ampere suggested that all the phenomena of\r\nthe magnetic needle might be explained by supposing currents of\r\nelectricity to circulate constantly in the shell of the globe in\r\ndirections parallel to the magnetic equator. This theory has acquired\r\nadditional consistency the farther we have advanced in science; and\r\naccording to the experiments of Mr. Fox, on the electro-magnetic\r\nproperties of metalliferous veins, some trace of electric currents seems\r\nto have been detected in the interior of the earth.[756]\r\n\r\nSome philosophers ascribe these currents to the chemical action going on\r\nin the superficial parts of the globe to which air and water have the\r\nreadiest access; while others refer them, in part at least, to\r\nthermo-electricity excited by the solar rays on the surface of the earth\r\nduring its rotation; successive parts of the atmosphere, land, and sea\r\nbeing exposed to the influence of the sun, and then cooled again in the\r\nnight. That this idea is not a mere speculation, is proved by the\r\ncorrespondence of the diurnal variations of the magnet with the apparent\r\nmotion of the sun; and by the greater amount of variation in summer than\r\nin winter, and during the day than in the night. M. de la Rive, although\r\nconceding that such minor variations of the needle may be due to\r\nthermo-electricity, contends that the general phenomena of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism must be attributed to currents far more intense; which, though\r\nliable to secular fluctuations, act with much greater constancy and\r\nregularity than the causes which produce the diurnal variations.[757]\r\nThe remark seems just; yet it is difficult to assign limits to the\r\naccumulated influence even of a very feeble force constantly acting on\r\nthe whole surface of the earth. This subject, however, must evidently\r\nremain obscure, until we become acquainted with the causes which give a\r\ndeterminate direction to the supposed electric currents. Already the\r\nexperiments of Faraday on the rotation of magnets have led him to\r\nspeculate on the manner in which the earth, when once it had become\r\nmagnetic, might produce electric currents within itself, in consequence\r\nof its diurnal rotation.[758] We have seen also in a former chapter (p.\r\n129) that the recent observations of Schwabe, 1852, have led Col. Sabine\r\nto the discovery of a connection between certain periodical changes,\r\nwhich take place in the spots on the sun, and a certain cycle of\r\nvariations in terrestrial magnetism. These seem to point to the\r\nexistence of a solar magnetic period, and suggest the idea of the sun's\r\nmagnetism exerting an influence on the mass of our planet.\r\n\r\nIn regard to thermo-electricity, I may remark, that it may be generated\r\nby great inequalities of temperature, arising from a partial\r\ndistribution of volcanic heat. Wherever, for example, masses of rock\r\noccur of great horizontal extent, and of considerable depth, which are\r\nat one point in a state of fusion (as beneath some active volcano); at\r\nanother, red-hot; and at a third, comparatively cold--strong\r\nthermo-electric action may be excited.\r\n\r\nSome, perhaps, may object, that this is reasoning in a circle; first to\r\nintroduce electricity as one of the primary causes of volcanic heat, and\r\nthen to derive the same heat from thermo-electric currents. But there\r\nmust, in truth, be much reciprocal action between the agents now under\r\nconsideration; and it is very difficult to decide which should be\r\nregarded as the prime mover, or to see where the train of changes, once\r\nbegun, would terminate. Whether subterranean electric currents if once\r\nexcited might sometimes possess the decomposing power of the voltaic\r\npile, is a question not perhaps easily answered in the present state of\r\nscience; but such a power, if developed, would at once supply us with a\r\nnever-failing source of chemical action from which volcanic heat might\r\nbe derived.\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation._--Before entering, in the next chapter, still farther\r\ninto the inquiry, how far the phenomena of volcanoes and earthquakes\r\naccord with the hypothesis of a continued generation of heat by chemical\r\naction, it may be desirable to recapitulate, in a few words, the\r\nconclusions already obtained.\r\n\r\n1st. The primary causes of the volcano and the earthquake are, to a\r\ngreat extent, the same, and must be connected with the passage of heat\r\nfrom the interior to the surface.\r\n\r\n2dly. This heat has been referred, by many, to a supposed state of\r\nigneous fusion of the central parts of the planet when it was first\r\ncreated, of which a part still remains in the interior, but is always\r\ndiminishing in intensity.\r\n\r\n3dly. The spheroidal figure of the earth, adduced in support of this\r\ntheory, does not of necessity imply a universal and simultaneous\r\nfluidity, in the beginning; for supposing the original figure of our\r\nplanet had been strictly spherical--which, however, is a gratuitous\r\nassumption, resting on no established analogy--still the statical figure\r\nmust have been assumed, if sufficient time be allowed, by the gradual\r\noperation of the centrifugal force, acting on the materials brought\r\nsuccessively within its action by aqueous and igneous causes.\r\n\r\n4thly. It appears, from experiment, that the heat in mines increases\r\nprogressively with their depth; and if the ratio of increase be\r\ncontinued uniformly from the surface to the interior, the whole globe,\r\nwith the exception of a small external shell, must be fluid, and the\r\ncentral parts must have a temperature many times higher than that of\r\nmelted iron.\r\n\r\n5thly. But the theory adopted by M. Cordier and others, which maintains\r\nthe actual existence of such a state of things, seems wholly\r\ninconsistent with the laws which regulate the circulation of heat\r\nthrough fluid bodies. For, if the central heat were as intense as is\r\nrepresented, there must be a circulation of currents, tending to\r\nequalize the temperature of the resulting fluids, and the solid crust\r\nitself would be melted.\r\n\r\n6thly. Instead of an original central heat, we may, perhaps, refer the\r\nheat of the interior to chemical changes constantly going on in the\r\nearth's crust; for the general effect of chemical combination is the\r\nevolution of heat and electricity, which in their turn become sources of\r\nnew chemical changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF EARTHQUAKES AND VOLCANOES--_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Review of the proofs of internal heat--Theory of an unoxidated\r\n    metallic nucleus--Whether the decomposition of water may be a source\r\n    of volcanic heat--Geysers of Iceland--Causes of\r\n    earthquakes--Wavelike motion--Expansive power of liquid\r\n    gases--Connection between the state of the atmosphere and\r\n    earthquakes--Permanent upheaval and subsidence of land--Expansion of\r\n    rocks by heat--The balance of dry land how preserved--Subsidence in\r\n    excess--Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect that the largest mountains are but insignificant\r\nprotuberances upon the surface of the earth, and that these mountains\r\nare nevertheless composed of different parts which have been formed in\r\nsuccession, we may well feel surprise that the central fluidity of the\r\nplanet should have been called in to account for volcanic phenomena. To\r\nsuppose the entire globe to be in a state of igneous fusion, with the\r\nexception of a solid shell, not more than from thirty to one hundred\r\nmiles thick, and to imagine that the central heat of this fluid spheroid\r\nexceeds by more than two hundred times that of liquid lava, is to\r\nintroduce a force altogether disproportionate to the effects which it is\r\nrequired to explain.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary repose of the surface implies, on the contrary, an\r\ninertness in the internal mass which is truly wonderful. When we\r\nconsider the combustible nature of the elements of the earth, so far as\r\nthey are known to us,--the facility with which their compounds may be\r\ndecomposed and made to enter into new combinations,--the quantity of\r\nheat which they evolve during these processes; when we recollect the\r\nexpansive power of steam, and that water itself is composed of two gases\r\nwhich, by their union, produce intense heat; when we call to mind the\r\nnumber of explosive and detonating compounds which have been already\r\ndiscovered, we may be allowed to share the astonishment of Pliny, that a\r\nsingle day should pass without a general conflagration:--\"Excedit\r\nprofecto omnia miracula, ullum diem fuisse quo non cuncta\r\nconflagrarent.\"[759]\r\n\r\nThe signs of internal heat observable on the surface of the earth do not\r\nnecessarily indicate the permanent existence of subterranean heated\r\nmasses, whether fluid or solid, by any means so vast as our continents\r\nand seas; yet how insignificant would these appear if distributed\r\nthrough an external shell of the globe one or two hundred miles in\r\ndepth! The principal facts in proof of the accumulation of heat below\r\nthe surface may be summed up in a few words. Several volcanoes are\r\nconstantly in eruption, as Stromboli and Nicaragua; others are known to\r\nhave been active for periods of 60, or even 150 years, as those of\r\nSangay in Quito, Popocatepetl in Mexico, and the volcano of the Isle of\r\nBourbon. Many craters emit hot vapors in the intervals between\r\neruptions, and solfataras evolve incessantly the same gases as\r\nvolcanoes. Steam of high temperature has continued for more than twenty\r\ncenturies to issue from the \"stufas,\" as the Italians call them; thermal\r\nsprings abound not only in regions of earthquakes, but are found in\r\nalmost all countries, however distant from active vents; and, lastly,\r\nthe temperature in the mines of various parts of the world is found to\r\nincrease in proportion as we descend.\r\n\r\nThe diagram (fig. 93) in the next page, may convey some idea of the\r\nproportion which our continents and the ocean bear to the radius of the\r\nearth.[760] If all the land were about as high as the Himalaya\r\nmountains, and the ocean everywhere as deep as the Pacific, the whole of\r\nboth might be contained within a space expressed by the thickness of the\r\nline _a b_; and masses of nearly equal volume might be placed in the\r\nspace marked by the line _c d_, in the interior. Seas of lava,\r\ntherefore, of the size of the Mediterranean, or even of the Atlantic,\r\nwould be as nothing if distributed through such an outer shell of the\r\nglobe as is represented by the shaded portion of the figure _a b c d_.\r\nIf throughout that space we imagine electro-chemical causes to be\r\ncontinually in operation, even of very feeble power, they might give\r\nrise to heat which, if accumulated at certain points, might melt or\r\nrender red-hot entire mountains, or sustain the temperature of stufas\r\nand hot springs for ages.\r\n\r\n_Theory of an unoxidated metallic nucleus._--When Sir H. Davy first\r\ndiscovered the metallic basis of the earths and alkalies, he threw out\r\nthe idea that those metals might abound in an unoxidized state in the\r\nsubterranean regions to which water must occasionally penetrate.\r\nWhenever this happened, gaseous matter would be set free, the metals\r\nwould combine with the oxygen of the water, and sufficient heat might be\r\nevolved to melt the surrounding rocks. This hypothesis, although\r\nafterwards abandoned by its author, was at first very favorably received\r\nboth by the chemist and the geologist: for silica, alumina, lime, soda,\r\nand oxide of iron,--substances of which lavas are principally\r\ncomposed,--would all result from the contact of the inflammable metals\r\nalluded to with water. But whence this abundant store of unsaturated\r\nmetals in the interior? It was assumed that, in the beginning of things,\r\nthe nucleus of the earth was mainly composed of inflammable metals, and\r\nthat oxidation went on with intense energy at first; till at length,\r\nwhen a superficial crust of oxides had been formed, the chemical action\r\nbecame more and more languid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.\r\n\r\nCentre of the earth.]\r\n\r\nThis speculation, like all others respecting the primitive state of the\r\nearth's nucleus, rests unavoidably on arbitrary assumptions. But we may\r\nfairly inquire whether any existing causes may have the power of\r\ndeoxidating the earthy and alkaline compounds formed from time to time\r\nby the action of water upon the metallic bases. If so, and if the\r\noriginal crust or nucleus of the planet contained distributed through it\r\nhere and there some partial stores of potassium, sodium, and other\r\nmetallic bases, these might be oxidated and again deoxidated, so as to\r\nsustain for ages a permanent chemical action. Yet even then we should be\r\nunable to explain why such a continuous circle of operations, after\r\nhaving been kept up for thousands of years in one district, should\r\nentirely cease, and why another region, which had enjoyed a respite from\r\nvolcanic action for one or many geological periods, should become a\r\ntheatre for the development of subterranean heat.\r\n\r\nIt is well known to chemists, that the metallization of oxides, the most\r\ndifficult to reduce, may be effected by hydrogen brought into contact\r\nwith them at a red heat; and it is more than probable that the\r\nproduction of potassium itself, in the common gun-barrel process, is due\r\nto the power of nascent hydrogen derived from the water which the\r\nhydrated oxide contains. According to the recent experiments, also, of\r\nFaraday, it would appear that every case of metallic reduction by\r\nvoltaic agency, from saline solutions, in which water is present, is due\r\nto the secondary action of hydrogen upon the oxide; both of these being\r\ndetermined to the negative pole and then reacting upon one another.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that intense heat would be produced by the occasional\r\ncontact of water with the metallic bases; and it is certain that, during\r\nthe process of saturation, vast volumes of hydrogen must be evolved. The\r\nhydrogen, thus generated, might permeate the crust of the earth in\r\ndifferent directions, and become stored up for ages in fissures and\r\ncaverns, sometimes in a liquid form, under the necessary pressure.\r\nWhenever, at any subsequent period, in consequence of the changes\r\neffected by earthquakes in the shell of the earth, this gas happened to\r\ncome in contact with metallic oxides at a high temperature, the\r\nreduction of these oxides might be the result.\r\n\r\nNo theory seems at first more startling than that which represents water\r\nas affording an inexhaustible supply of fuel to the volcanic fires; yet\r\nis it by no means visionary. It is a fact that must not be overlooked,\r\nthat while a great number of volcanoes are entirely submarine, the\r\nremainder occur for the most part in islands or maritime tracts. There\r\nare a few exceptions; but some of these, observes Dr. Daubeny, are near\r\ninland salt lakes, as in Central Tartary; while others form part of a\r\ntrain of volcanoes, the extremities of which are near the sea.\r\n\r\nSir H. Davy suggested that, when the sea is distant, as in the case of\r\nsome of the South American volcanoes, they may still be supplied with\r\nwater from subterranean lakes; since, according to Humboldt, large\r\nquantities of fish are often thrown out during eruptions.[761] Mr. Dana\r\nalso, in his valuable and original observations on the volcanoes of the\r\nSandwich Islands, reminds us of the prodigious volume of atmospheric\r\nwater which must be absorbed into the interior of such large and lofty\r\ndomes, composed as they are entirely of porous lava. To this source\r\nalone he refers the production of the steam by which the melted matter\r\nis propelled upwards, even to the summit of cones three miles in\r\nheight.[762]\r\n\r\nWhen treating of springs and overflowing wells, I have stated that\r\nporous rocks are percolated by fresh water to great depths, and that\r\nsea-water probably penetrates in the same manner through the rocks which\r\nform the bed of the ocean. But, besides this universal circulation in\r\nregions not far from the surface, it must be supposed that, wherever\r\nearthquakes prevail, much larger bodies of water will be forced by the\r\npressure of the ocean into fissures at great depths, or swallowed up in\r\nchasms; in the same manner as on the land, towns, houses, cattle, and\r\ntrees are sometimes engulfed. It will be remembered, that these chasms\r\noften close again after houses have fallen into them; and for the same\r\nreason, when water has penetrated to a mass of melted lava, the steam\r\ninto which it is converted may often rush out at a different aperture\r\nfrom that by which the water entered.\r\n\r\nThe gases, it is said, exhaled from volcanoes, together with steam, are\r\nsuch as would result from the decomposition of salt water, and the fumes\r\nwhich escape from the Vesuvian lava have been observed to deposit common\r\nsalt.[763] The emission of free muriatic acid gas in great quantities is\r\nalso thought by many to favor the theory of the decomposition of the\r\nsalt contained in sea-water. It has been objected, however, that M.\r\nBoussingault did not meet with this gas in his examination of the\r\nelastic fluids evolved from the volcanoes of equatorial America; which\r\nonly give out aqueous vapor (in very large quantity), carbonic acid gas,\r\nsulphurous acid gas, and sometimes fumes of sulphur.[764] In reply, Dr.\r\nDaubeny has remarked, that muriatic acid may have ceased to be\r\ndisengaged, because the volcanic action has become languid in equatorial\r\nAmerica, and sea-water may no longer obtain admission.\r\n\r\nM. Gay Lussac, while he avows his opinion that the decomposition of\r\nwater contributes largely to volcanic action, called attention,\r\nnevertheless, to the supposed fact, that hydrogen had not been detected\r\nin a separate form among the gaseous products of volcanoes; nor can it,\r\nhe says, be present; for, in that case, it would be inflamed in the air\r\nby the red-hot stones thrown out during an eruption. Dr. Davy, in his\r\naccount of Graham Island, says, \"I watched when the lightning was most\r\nvivid, and the eruption of the greatest degree of violence, to see if\r\nthere was any inflammation occasioned by this natural electric\r\nspark--any indication of the presence of inflammable gas; but in\r\nvain.\"[765]\r\n\r\nMay not the hydrogen, Gay Lussac inquires, be combined with chlorine,\r\nand produce muriatic acid? for this gas has been observed to be evolved\r\nfrom Vesuvius--and the chlorine may have been derived from sea salt;\r\nwhich was, in fact, extracted by simple washing from the Vesuvian lava\r\nof 1822, in the proportion of nine per cent.[766] But it was answered,\r\nthat Sir H. Davy's experiments had shown, that hydrogen is not\r\ncombustible when mixed with muriatic acid gas; so that if muriatic gas\r\nwas evolved in large quantities, the hydrogen might be present without\r\ninflammation.[767] M. Abich, on the other hand, assures us, \"that\r\nalthough it be true that vapor illuminated by incandescent lava has\r\noften been mistaken for flame,\" yet he clearly detected in the eruption\r\nof Vesuvius in 1834 the flame of hydrogen.[768]\r\n\r\nM. Gay Lussac, in the memoir just alluded to, expressed doubt as to the\r\npresence of sulphurous acid; but the abundant disengagement of this gas\r\nduring eruptions has been since ascertained: and thus all difficulty in\r\nregard to the general absence of hydrogen in an inflammable state is\r\nremoved; for, as Dr. Daubeny suggests, the hydrogen of decomposed water\r\nmay unite with sulphur to form sulphuretted hydrogen gas, and this gas\r\nwill then be mingled with the sulphurous acid as it rises to the crater.\r\nIt is shown by experiment, that these gases mutually decompose each\r\nother when mixed where steam is present; the hydrogen of the one\r\nimmediately uniting with the oxygen of the other to form water, while\r\nthe excess of sulphurous acid alone escapes into the atmosphere. Sulphur\r\nis at the same time precipitated.\r\n\r\nThis explanation is sufficient; but it may also be observed that the\r\nflame of hydrogen would rarely be visible during an eruption; as that\r\ngas, when inflamed in a pure state, burns with a very faint blue flame,\r\nwhich even in the night could hardly be perceptible by the side of\r\nred-hot and incandescent cinders. Its immediate, conversion into water\r\nwhen inflamed in the atmosphere, might also account for its not\r\nappearing in a separate form.\r\n\r\nDr. Daubeny is of opinion that water containing atmospheric air may\r\ndescend from the surface of the earth to the volcanic foci, and that the\r\nsame process of combustion by which water is decomposed may deprive such\r\nsubterranean air of its oxygen. In this manner he explains the great\r\nquantities of nitrogen evolved from volcanic vents and thermal waters,\r\nand the fact that air disengaged from the earth in volcanic regions is\r\neither wholly or in part deprived of its oxygen.\r\n\r\nSir H. Davy, in his memoir on the \"Phenomena of Volcanoes,\" remarks,\r\nthat there was every reason to suppose in Vesuvius the existence of a\r\ndescending current of air; and he imagined that subterranean cavities\r\nwhich threw out large volumes of steam during the eruption, might\r\nafterwards, in the quiet state of the volcano, become filled with\r\natmospheric air.[769] The presence of ammoniacal salts in volcanic\r\nemanations, and of ammonia (which is in part composed of nitrogen) in\r\nlava, favors greatly the notion of air as well as water being deoxidated\r\nin the interior of the earth.[770]\r\n\r\nIt has been alleged by Professor Bischoff that the slight specific\r\ngravity of the metals of the alkalies is fatal to Davy's hypothesis, for\r\nif the mean density of the earth, as determined by astronomers, surpass\r\nthat of all kinds of rocks, these metals cannot exist, at least not in\r\ngreat quantities in the interior of the earth.[771] But Dr. Daubeny has\r\nshown, that if we take the united specific gravity of potassium, sodium,\r\nsilicon, iron, and all the materials which, when united with oxygen,\r\nconstitute ordinary lava, and then compare their weight with lava of\r\nequal bulk, the difference is not very material, the specific gravity of\r\nthe lava only exceeding by about one-fourth that of the unoxidized\r\nmetals. Besides, at great depths, the metallic bases of the earths and\r\nalkalies may very probably be rendered heavier by pressure.[772] Nor is\r\nit fair to embarrass the chemical theory of volcanoes with a doctrine so\r\npurely gratuitous, as that which supposes the entire nucleus of the\r\nplanet to have been at first composed of unoxidated metals.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bunsen of Marburg, after analyzing the gases which escape from\r\nthe volcanic fumeroles and solfataras of Iceland, and after calculating\r\nthe quantity of hydrogen evolved between two eruptions, affirms, in\r\ncontradiction of opinions previously entertained, that the hydrogen\r\nbears a perfect relation in quantity to the magnitude of the streams of\r\nlava, assuming the fusion of these last to have been the result of the\r\nheat evolved during the oxidation of alkaline and earthy metals, and\r\nthis to have been brought about by the decomposition of water. Yet after\r\nhaving thus succeeded in removing the principal objection once so\r\ntriumphantly urged against Davy's hypothesis, Bunsen concludes by\r\ndeclaring that the hydrogen evolved in volcanic regions cannot have been\r\ngenerated by the decomposition of water coming in contact with alkaline\r\nand earthy metallic bases. For, says the Professor, this process\r\npresupposes the prevalence of a temperature in which carbonic acid\r\ncannot exist in contact with hydrogen without suffering a partial\r\nreduction to carbonic oxide; \"and not a trace of carbonic oxide is ever\r\nfound in volcanic exhalations.\"[773] At the same time it will be seen,\r\nby consulting the able memoirs of the Marburg chemist, that he supposes\r\nmany energetic kinds of chemical action to be continually going on in\r\nthe interior of the earth, capable of causing the disengagement of\r\nhydrogen; and there can be no doubt that this gas may be a source of\r\ninnumerable new changes, capable of producing the local development of\r\ninternal heat.\r\n\r\n_Cause of volcanic eruptions._--The most probable causes of a volcanic\r\noutburst at the surface have been in a great degree anticipated in the\r\npreceding speculations on the liquefaction of rocks and the generation\r\nof gases. When a minute hole is bored in a tube filled with gas\r\ncondensed into a liquid, the whole becomes instantly aeriform, or, as\r\nsome writers have expressed it, \"flashes into vapor,\" and often bursts\r\nthe tube. Such an experiment may represent the mode in which gaseous\r\nmatter may rush through a rent in the rocks, and continue to escape for\r\ndays or weeks through a small orifice, with an explosive power\r\nsufficient to reduce every substance which opposes its passage into\r\nsmall fragments or even dust. Lava may be propelled upwards at the same\r\ntime, and ejected in the form of scoriae. In some places, where the fluid\r\nlava lies at the bottom of a deep fissure, communicating on the one hand\r\nwith the surface, and on the other with a cavern in which a considerable\r\nbody of vapor has been formed, there may be an efflux of lava, followed\r\nby the escape of gas. Eruptions often commence and close with the\r\ndischarge of vapor; and, when this is the case, the next outburst may be\r\nexpected to take place by the same vent, for the concluding evolution of\r\nelastic fluids will keep open the duct, and leave it unobstructed.\r\n\r\nThe breaking out of lava from the side or base of a lofty cone, rather\r\nthan from the summit, may be attributed to the hydrostatic pressure to\r\nwhich the flanks of the mountain are exposed, when the column of lava\r\nhas risen to a great height. Or if, before it has reached the top, there\r\nshould happen to be any stoppage in the main duct, the upward pressure\r\nof the ascending column of gas and lava may burst a lateral opening.\r\n\r\nIn the case however of Mount Loa, in the Sandwich Islands, there appears\r\nto be a singular want of connection or sympathy between the eruptions of\r\nthe central and the great lateral vent. The great volcanic cone alluded\r\nto rises to the height of 13,760 feet above the level of the sea, having\r\na crater at its summit, from which powerful streams of lava have flowed\r\nin recent times, and having another still larger crater, called Kilauea,\r\non its southeastern slope, about 4000 feet above the sea. This lateral\r\ncavity resembles a huge quarry cut in the mountain's side, being about\r\n1000 feet deep when in its ordinary state. It is seven miles and a half\r\nin circuit, and scattered over its bottom, at different levels, are\r\nlakes and pools of lava, always in a state of ebullition. The liquid in\r\none of these will sometimes sink 100 or 150 feet, while it is\r\noverflowing in another at a higher elevation, there being, it should\r\nseem, no communication between them. In like manner, lava overflows in\r\nthe summit crater of Mount Loa, nearly 14,000 feet high, while the great\r\nlateral cauldron just alluded to (of Kilauea) continues as tranquil as\r\nusual, affording no relief to any part of the gases or melted matter\r\nwhich are forcing their way upwards in the centre of the mountain.\r\n\"How,\" asks Mr. Dana, \"if there were any subterranean channel connecting\r\nthe two great vents, could this want of sympathy exist? How, according\r\nto the laws of hydrostatic pressure, can a column of fluid stand 10,000\r\nfeet higher in one leg of the siphon than in the other?\" The eruptions,\r\nhe observes, are not paroxysmal; on the contrary, the lava rises slowly\r\nand gradually to the summit of the lofty cone, and then escapes there\r\nwithout any commotion manifesting itself in Kilauea, a gulf always open\r\non the flanks of the same mountain. One conclusion, he says, is certain,\r\nnamely, _that volcanoes are no safety valves_ as they have been called;\r\nfor here two independent and apparently isolated centres of volcanic\r\nactivity, only sixteen miles distant from each other, are sustained in\r\none and the same cone.[774]\r\n\r\nWithout pretending to solve this enigma, I cannot refrain from\r\nremarking, that the supposed independence of several orifices of\r\neruption in one crater like Kilauea, when adduced in confirmation of the\r\ndoctrine of two distinct sources of volcanic action underneath one\r\nmountain, proves too much. No one can doubt, that the pools of lava in\r\nKilauea have been derived from some common reservoir, and have resulted\r\nfrom a combination of causes commonly called volcanic, which are at work\r\nin the interior at some unknown distance below. These causes have given\r\nrise in Mount Loa to eruptions from many points, but principally from\r\none centre, so that a vast dome of ejected matter has been piled up. The\r\nsubsidiary crater has evidently never given much relief to the\r\nimprisoned, heated, and liquefied matter, for Kilauea does not form a\r\nlateral protuberance interfering with the general shape or uniform\r\noutline of Mount Loa.\r\n\r\n_Geysers of Iceland._--As aqueous vapor constitutes the most abundant of\r\nthe aeriform products of volcanoes in eruption, it may be well to\r\nconsider attentively a case in which steam is exclusively the moving\r\npower--that of the Geysers of Iceland. These intermittent hot springs\r\noccur in a district situated in the southwestern division of Iceland,\r\nwhere nearly one hundred of them are said to break out within a circle\r\nof two miles. That the water is of atmospheric origin, derived from rain\r\nand melted snow, is proved, says Professor Bunsen, by the nitrogen which\r\nrises from them either pure or mixed with other gases. The springs rise\r\nthrough a thick current of lava, which may perhaps have flowed from\r\nMount Hecla, the summit of that volcano being seen from the spot at the\r\ndistance of more than thirty miles. In this district the rushing of\r\nwater is sometimes heard in chasms beneath the surface; for here, as on\r\nEtna, rivers flow in subterranean channels through the porous and\r\ncavernous lavas. It has more than once happened, after earthquakes, that\r\nsome of the boiling fountains have increased or diminished in violence\r\nand volume, or entirely ceased, or that new ones have made their\r\nappearance--changes which may be explained by the opening of new rents\r\nand the closing of pre-existing fissures.\r\n\r\nFew of the Geysers play longer than five or six minutes at a time,\r\nalthough sometimes half an hour. The intervals between their eruptions\r\nare for the most part very irregular. The Great Geyser rises out of a\r\nspacious basin at the summit of a circular mound composed of siliceous\r\nincrustations deposited from the spray of its waters. The diameter of\r\nthis basin, in one direction, is fifty-six feet, and forty-six in\r\nanother. (See fig. 94.) In the centre is a pipe seventy-eight feet in\r\nperpendicular depth, and from eight to ten feet in diameter, but\r\ngradually widening, as it rises into the basin. The inside of the basin\r\nis whitish, consisting of a siliceous crust, and perfectly smooth, as\r\nare likewise two small channels on the sides of the mound, down which\r\nthe water escapes when the bowl is filled to the margin. The circular\r\nbasin is sometimes empty, as represented in the following sketch; but is\r\nusually filled with beautifully transparent water in a state of\r\nebullition. During the rise of the boiling water in the pipe, especially\r\nwhen the ebullition is most violent, and when the water is thrown up in\r\njets, subterranean noises are heard, like the distant firing of cannon,\r\nand the earth is slightly shaken. The sound then increases and the\r\nmotion becomes more violent, till at length a column of water is thrown\r\nup, with loud explosions, to the height of one or two hundred feet.\r\nAfter playing for a time like an artificial fountain, and giving off\r\ngreat clouds of vapor, the pipe or tube is emptied; and a column of\r\nsteam, rushing up with amazing force and a thundering noise, terminates\r\nthe eruption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.\r\n\r\nView of the Crater of the Great Geyser in Iceland.[775]]\r\n\r\nIf stones are thrown into the crater, they are instantly ejected; and\r\nsuch is the explosive force, that very hard rocks are sometimes shivered\r\nby it into small pieces. Henderson found that by throwing a great\r\nquantity of large stones into the pipe of Strockr, one of the Geysers,\r\nhe could bring on an eruption in a few minutes.[776] The fragments of\r\nstone, as well as the boiling water, were thrown in that case to a much\r\ngreater height than usual. After the water had been ejected, a column of\r\nsteam continued to rush up with a deafening roar for nearly an hour; but\r\nthe Geyser, as if exhausted by this effort, did not send out a fresh\r\neruption when its usual interval of rest had elapsed. The account given\r\nby Sir George Mackenzie of a Geyser which he saw in eruption in 1810\r\n(see fig. 95), agrees perfectly with the above description by Henderson.\r\nThe steam and water rose for half an hour to the height of 70 feet, and\r\nthe white column remained perpendicular notwithstanding a brisk gale of\r\nwind which was blowing against it. Stones thrown into the pipe were\r\nprojected to a greater height than the water. To leeward of the vapor a\r\nheavy shower of rain was seen to fall.[777]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.\r\n\r\nEruption of the New Geyser in 1810. (Mackenzie.)]\r\n\r\nAmong the different theories proposed to account for these phenomena, I\r\nshall first mention one suggested by Sir. J. Herschel. An imitation of\r\nthese jets, he says, may be produced on a small scale, by heating red\r\nhot the stem of a tobacco pipe, filling the bowl with water, and so\r\ninclining the pipe as to let the water run through the stem. Its escape,\r\ninstead of taking place in a continued stream, is then performed by a\r\nsuccession of violent explosions, at first of steam alone, then of water\r\nmixed with steam; and, as the pipe cools, almost wholly of water. At\r\nevery such paroxysmal escape of the water, a portion is driven back,\r\naccompanied with steam, into the bowl. The intervals between the\r\nexplosions depend on the heat, length, and inclination of the pipe;\r\ntheir continuance, on its thickness and conducting power.[778] The\r\napplication of this experiment to the Geysers merely requires that a\r\nsubterranean stream, flowing through the pores and crevices of lava,\r\nshould suddenly reach a fissure in which the rock is red hot or nearly\r\nso. Steam would immediately be formed, which, rushing up the fissure,\r\nmight force up water along with it to the surface, while, at the same\r\ntime, part of the steam might drive back the water of the supply for a\r\ncertain distance towards its source. And when, after the space of some\r\nminutes, the steam was all condensed, the water would return, and a\r\nrepetition of the phenomena take place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.\r\n\r\nSupposed reservoir and pipe of a Geyser in Iceland.[779]]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another mode of explaining the action of the Geyser,\r\nperhaps more probable than that above described. Suppose water\r\npercolating from the surface of the earth to penetrate into the\r\nsubterranean cavity A D (fig. 96) by the fissures F F, while, at the\r\nsame time, steam at an extremely high temperature, such as is commonly\r\ngiven out from the rents of lava currents during congelation, emanates\r\nfrom the fissures C. A portion of the steam is at first condensed into\r\nwater, while the temperature of the water is raised by the latent heat\r\nthus evolved, till, at last, the lower part of the cavity is filled with\r\nboiling water and the upper with steam under high pressure. The\r\nexpansive force of the steam becomes, at length, so great, that the\r\nwater is forced up the fissure or pipe E B, and runs over the rim of the\r\nbasin. When the pressure is thus diminished, the steam in the upper part\r\nof the cavity A expands, until all the water D is driven into the pipe;\r\nand when this happens, the steam, being the lighter of the two fluids,\r\nrushes up through the water with great velocity. If the pipe be choked\r\nup artificially, even for a few minutes, a great increase of heat must\r\ntake place; for it is prevented from escaping in a latent form in steam;\r\nso that the water is made to boil more violently, and this brings on an\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bunsen, before cited, adopts this theory to account for the\r\nplay of the \"Little Geyser,\" but says it will not explain the phenomena\r\nof the Great one. He considers this, like the others, to be a thermal\r\nspring, having a narrow funnel-shaped tube in the upper part of its\r\ncourse, where the walls of the channel have become coated over with\r\nsiliceous incrustations. At the mouth of this tube the water has a\r\ntemperature, corresponding to the pressure of the atmosphere, of about\r\n212 degrees Fahr., but at a certain depth below it is much hotter. This\r\nthe professor succeeded in proving by experiment; a thermometer\r\nsuspended by a string in the pipe rising to 266 degrees Fahr., or no\r\nless than 48 degrees above the boiling point. After the column of water\r\nhas been expelled, what remains in the basin and pipe is found to be\r\nmuch cooled.\r\n\r\nPreviously to these experiments of Bunsen and Descloizeaux, made in\r\nIceland in 1846, it would scarcely have been supposed possible that the\r\nlower part of a free and open column of water could be raised so much in\r\ntemperature without causing a circulation of ascending and descending\r\ncurrents, followed by an almost immediate equalization of heat. Such\r\ncirculation is no doubt impeded greatly by the sides of the well not\r\nbeing vertical, and by numerous contractions of its diameter, but the\r\nphenomenon may be chiefly due to another cause. According to recent\r\nexperiments on the cohesion of liquids by Mr. Donny of Ghent, it appears\r\nthat when water is freed from all admixture of air, its temperature can\r\nbe raised, even under ordinary atmospheric pressure, to 275 degrees\r\nFahr., so much does the cohesion of its molecules increase[780] when\r\nthey are not separated by particles of air. As water long boiled becomes\r\nmore and more deprived of air, it is probably very free from such\r\nintermixture at the bottom of the Geysers.\r\n\r\nAmong other results of the experiments of Bunsen and his companion, they\r\nconvinced themselves that the column of fluid filling the tube is\r\nconstantly receiving accessions of hot water from below, while it\r\nbecomes cooler above by evaporation on the broad surface of the basin.\r\nThey also came to a conclusion of no small interest, as bearing on the\r\nprobable mechanism of ordinary volcanic eruptions, namely that the tube\r\nitself is the main seat or focus of mechanical force. This was proved by\r\nletting down stones suspended by strings to various depths. Those which\r\nwere sunk to considerable distances from the surface were not cast up\r\nagain, whereas those nearer the mouth of the tube were ejected to great\r\nheights. Other experiments also were made tending to demonstrate the\r\nsingular fact, that there is often scarce any motion below, when a\r\nviolent rush of steam and water is taking place above. It seems that\r\nwhen a lofty column of water possesses a temperature increasing with the\r\ndepth, any slight ebullition or disturbance of equilibrium in the upper\r\nportion may first force up water into the basin, and then cause it to\r\nflow over the edge. A lower portion, thus suddenly relieved of part of\r\nits pressure, expands and is converted into vapor more rapidly than the\r\nfirst, owing to its greater heat. This allows the next subjacent\r\nstratum, which is much hotter, to rise and flash into a gaseous form;\r\nand this process goes on till the ebullition has descended from the\r\nmiddle to near the bottom of the funnel.[781]\r\n\r\nIn speculating, therefore, on the mechanism of an ordinary volcanic\r\neruption, we may suppose that large subterranean cavities exist at the\r\ndepth of some miles below the surface of the earth, in which melted lava\r\naccumulates; and when water containing the usual mixture of air\r\npenetrates into these, the steam thus generated may press upon the lava\r\nand force it up the duct of a volcano, in the same manner as a column of\r\nwater is driven up the pipe of a Geyser. In other cases we may suppose a\r\ncontinuous column of liquid lava mixed with _red-hot water_ (for water\r\nmay exist in that state, as Professor Bunsen reminds us, under\r\npressure), and this column may have a temperature regularly increasing\r\ndownwards. A disturbance of equilibrium may first bring on an eruption\r\nnear the surface, by the expansion and conversion into gas of entangled\r\nwater and other constituents of what we call lava, so as to occasion a\r\ndiminution of pressure. More steam would then be liberated, carrying up\r\nwith it jets of melted rock, which being hurled up into the air may fall\r\nin showers of ashes on the surrounding country, and at length, by the\r\narrival of lava and water more and more heated at the orifice of the\r\nduct or the crater of the volcano, expansive power may be acquired\r\nsufficient to expel a massive current of lava. After the eruption has\r\nceased, a period of tranquillity succeeds, during which fresh accessions\r\nof heat are communicated from below, and additional masses of rock fused\r\nby degrees, while at the same time atmospheric or sea water is\r\ndescending from the surface. At length the conditions required for a new\r\noutburst are obtained, and another cycle of similar changes is renewed.\r\n\r\n_Causes of earthquakes--wave-like motion._--I shall now proceed to\r\nexamine the manner in which the heat of the interior may give rise to\r\nearthquakes. One of the most common phenomena attending subterranean\r\nmovements, is the undulatory motion of the ground. And this, says\r\nMichell, will seem less extraordinary, if we call to mind the extreme\r\nelasticity of the earth and the compressibility of even the most solid\r\nmaterials. Large districts, he suggests, may rest on fluid lava; and,\r\nwhen this is disturbed, its motions may be propagated through the\r\nincumbent rocks. He also adds the following ingenious speculation:--\"As\r\na small quantity of vapor almost instantly generated at some\r\nconsiderable depth below the surface of the earth will produce a\r\nvibratory motion, so a very large quantity (whether it be generated\r\nalmost instantly, or in any small portion of time) will produce a\r\nwave-like motion. The manner in which this wave-like motion will be\r\npropagated may, in some measure, be represented by the following\r\nexperiment:--Suppose a large cloth, or carpet (spread upon a floor), to\r\nbe raised at one edge, and then suddenly brought down again to the\r\nfloor; the air under it, being by this means propelled, will pass along\r\ntill it escapes at the opposite side, raising the cloth in a wave all\r\nthe way as it goes. In like manner, a large quantity of vapor may be\r\nconceived to raise the earth in a wave, as it passes along between the\r\nstrata, which it may easily separate in a horizontal direction, there\r\nbeing little or no cohesion between one stratum and another. The part of\r\nthe earth that is first raised being bent from its natural form, will\r\nendeavor to restore itself by its elasticity; and the parts next to it\r\nbeing to have their weight supported by the vapor, which will insinuate\r\nitself under them, will be raised in their turn, till it either finds\r\nsome vent, or is again condensed by the cold into water, and by that\r\nmeans prevented from proceeding any farther.\"[782] In a memoir published\r\nin 1843, on the structure of the Appalachian chain, by the Professors\r\nRogers,[783] the following hypothesis is proposed as \"simpler and more\r\nin accordance with dynamical considerations, and the recorded\r\nobservations on earthquakes.\"--\"In place,\" say they, \"of supposing it\r\npossible for a body of vapor or gaseous matter to pass horizontally\r\nbetween the strata, or even between the crust and the fluid lava upon\r\nwhich it floats, and with which it must be closely entangled, we are\r\ninclined to attribute the movement to an _actual pulsation_, engendered\r\nin the _molten matter itself_, by a linear disruption under enormous\r\ntension, giving vent explosively to elastic vapors, escaping either to\r\nthe surface, or into cavernous spaces beneath. According to this\r\nsupposition, the movement of the subterranean vapors would be _towards_,\r\nand not from, the disrupted belt, and the oscillation of the crust would\r\noriginate in the tremendous and sudden disturbance of the previous\r\npressure on the surface of the lava mass below, brought about by the\r\ninstantaneous and violent rending of the overlying strata.\"\r\n\r\nThis theory requires us to admit that the crust of the earth is so\r\nflexible, that it can assume the form, and follow the motion of an\r\nundulation in the fluid below. Even if we grant this, says Mr. Mallet,\r\nanother more serious objection presents itself, viz. the great velocity\r\nattributed to the transit of the wave in the subterranean sea of lava.\r\nWe are called upon to admit that the speed of the wave below equals that\r\nof the true earthquake shock at the surface, which is so immense, that\r\nit is not inferior to the velocity of sound in the same solids. But the\r\nundulation in the fluid below must follow the laws of a tidal wave, or\r\nof the great sea-wave already spoken of. \"Its velocity, like that of the\r\ntidal wave of our seas, will be a function of its length and of the\r\ndepth of the fluid, diminished in this case by certain considerations as\r\nto the density and degree of viscidity of the liquid; and although it\r\nwould be at present impossible, for want of data, to calculate the exact\r\nvelocity with which this subterraneous lava-wave could move, it may be\r\ncertainly affirmed that its velocity would be immeasurably short of the\r\nobserved or theoretic velocity of the great earth-wave, or true shock in\r\nearthquakes.\"[784]\r\n\r\n_Liquid gases._--The rending and upheaving of continental masses are\r\noperations which are not difficult to explain, when we are once\r\nconvinced that heat, of sufficient power, not only to melt but to reduce\r\nto a gaseous form a great variety of substances, is accumulated in\r\ncertain parts of the interior. We see that elastic fluids are capable of\r\nprojecting solid masses to immense heights in the air; and the volcano\r\nof Cotopaxi has been known to throw out, to the distance of eight or\r\nnine miles, a mass of rock about one hundred cubic yards in volume. When\r\nwe observe these aeriform fluids rushing out from particular vents for\r\nmonths, or even years, continuously, what power may we not expect them\r\nto exert in other places, where they happen to be confined under an\r\nenormous weight of rock?\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Faraday and others have shown, within the last twelve\r\nyears, that many of the gases, including all those which are most\r\ncopiously disengaged from volcanic vents, as the carbonic, sulphurous,\r\nand muriatic acids, may be condensed into liquids by pressure. At\r\ntemperatures of from 30 degrees to 50 degrees F., the pressure required\r\nfor this purpose varies from fifteen to fifty atmospheres; and this\r\namount of pressure we may regard as very insignificant in the operations\r\nof nature. A column of Vesuvian lava that would reach from the lip of\r\nthe crater to the level of the sea, must be equal to about three hundred\r\natmospheres; so that, at depths which may be termed moderate in the\r\ninterior of the crust of the earth, the gases may be condensed into\r\nliquids, even at very high temperatures. The method employed to reduce\r\nsome of these gases to a liquid state is, to confine the materials, from\r\nthe mutual action of which they are evolved, in tubes hermetically\r\nsealed, so that the accumulated pressure of the vapor, as it rises and\r\nexpands, may force some part of it to assume the liquid state. A similar\r\nprocess may, and indeed must, frequently take place in subterranean\r\ncaverns and fissures, or even in the pores and cells of many rocks; by\r\nwhich means, a much greater store of expansive power may be _packed_\r\ninto a small space than could happen if these vapors had not the\r\nproperty of becoming liquid. For, although the gas occupies much less\r\nroom in a liquid state, yet it exerts exactly the same pressure upon the\r\nsides of the containing cavity as if it remained in the form of vapor.\r\n\r\nIf a tube, whether of glass or other materials, filled with condensed\r\ngas, have its temperature slightly raised, it will often burst; for a\r\nslight increment of heat causes the elasticity of the gas to increase in\r\na very high ratio. We have only to suppose certain rocks, permeated by\r\nthese liquid gases (as porous strata are sometimes filled with water),\r\nto have their temperature raised some hundred degrees, and we obtain a\r\npower capable of lifting superincumbent masses of almost any conceivable\r\nthickness; while, if the depth at which the gas is confined be great,\r\nthere is no reason to suppose that any other appearances would be\r\nwitnessed by the inhabitants of the surface than vibratory movements and\r\nrents, from which no vapor might escape. In making their way through\r\nfissures a very few miles only in length, or in forcing a passage\r\nthrough soft yielding strata, the vapors may be cooled and absorbed by\r\nwater. For water has a strong affinity to several of the gases, and will\r\nabsorb large quantities, with a very slight increase of volume. In this\r\nmanner, the heat or the volume of springs may be augmented, and their\r\nmineral properties made to vary.\r\n\r\n_Connection between the state of the atmosphere and earthquakes._--The\r\ninhabitants of Stromboli, who are mostly fishermen, are said to make use\r\nof that volcano as a weather-glass, the eruptions being comparatively\r\nfeeble when the sky is serene, but increasing in turbulence during\r\ntempestuous weather, so that in winter the island often seems to shake\r\nfrom its foundations. Mr. P. Scrope, after calling attention to these\r\nand other analogous facts, first started the idea (as long ago as the\r\nyear 1825) that the diminished pressure of the atmosphere, the\r\nconcomitant of stormy weather, may modify the intensity of the volcanic\r\naction. He suggests that where liquid lava communicates with the\r\nsurface, as in the crater of Stromboli, it may rise or fall in the vent\r\non the same principle as mercury in a barometer; because the ebullition\r\nor expansive power of the steam contained in the lava would be checked\r\nby every increase, and augmented by every diminution of weight. In like\r\nmanner, if a bed of liquid lava be confined at an immense depth below\r\nthe surface, its expansive force may be counteracted partly by the\r\nweight of the incumbent rocks, and also in part by atmospheric pressure\r\nacting contemporaneously on a vast superficial area. In that case, if\r\nthe upheaving force increase gradually in energy, it will at length be\r\nrestrained by only the slightest degree of superiority in the antagonist\r\nor repressive power, and then the equilibrium may be suddenly destroyed\r\nby any cause, such as an ascending draught of air, which is capable of\r\ndepressing the barometer. In this manner we may account for the\r\nremarkable coincidence so frequently observed between the state of the\r\nweather and subterranean commotions, although it must be admitted that\r\nearthquakes and volcanic eruptions react in their turn upon the\r\natmosphere, so that disturbances of the latter are generally the\r\nconsequences rather than the forerunners of volcanic disturbances.[785]\r\n\r\nFrom an elaborate catalogue of the earthquakes experienced in Europe and\r\nSyria during the last fifteen centuries, M. Alexis Perrey has deduced\r\nthe conclusion that the number which happen in the winter season\r\npreponderates over those which occur in any one of the other seasons of\r\nthe year, there being, however, some exceptions to this rule, as in the\r\nPyrenees. Curious and valuable as are these data, M. d'Archiac justly\r\nremarks, in commenting upon them, that they are not as yet sufficiently\r\nextensive or accordant in different regions, to entitle us to deduce any\r\ngeneral conclusions from them respecting the laws of subterranean\r\nmovements throughout the globe.[786]\r\n\r\n_Permanent elevation and subsidence._--It is easy to conceive that the\r\nshattered rocks may assume an arched form during a convulsion, so that\r\nthe country above may remain permanently upheaved. In other cases gas\r\nmay drive before it masses of liquid lava, which may thus be injected\r\ninto newly opened fissures. The gas having then obtained more room, by\r\nthe forcing up of the incumbent rocks, may remain at rest; while the\r\nlava congealing in the rents may afford a solid foundation for the newly\r\nraised district.\r\n\r\nExperiments have recently been made in America, by Colonel Totten, to\r\nascertain the ratio according to which some of the stones commonly used\r\nin architecture expand with given increments of heat.[787] It was found\r\nimpossible, in a country where the annual variation of temperature was\r\nmore than 90 degrees F., to make a coping of stones, five feet in\r\nlength, in which the joints should fit so tightly as not to admit water\r\nbetween the stone and the cement; the annual contraction and expansion\r\nof the stones causing, at the junctions, small crevices, the width of\r\nwhich varied with the nature of the rock. It was ascertained that\r\nfine-grained granite expanded with 1 degrees F. at the rate of\r\n.000004825; while crystalline marble .000005668; and red sandstone\r\n.000009532, or about twice as much as granite.\r\n\r\nNow, according to this law of expansion, a mass of sandstone a mile in\r\nthickness, which should have its temperature raised 200 degrees F.,\r\nwould lift a superimposed layer of rock to the height of ten feet above\r\nits former level. But, suppose a part of the earth's crust, one hundred\r\nmiles in thickness and equally expansive, to have its temperature raised\r\n600 degrees or 800 degrees, this might produce an elevation of between\r\ntwo and three thousand feet. The cooling of the same mass might\r\nafterwards cause the overlying rocks to sink down again and resume their\r\noriginal position. By such agency we might explain the gradual rise of\r\nScandinavia or the subsidence of Greenland, if this last phenomenon\r\nshould also be established as a fact on farther inquiry.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible that as the clay in Wedgwood's pyrometer contracts,\r\nby giving off its water, and then, by incipient vitrification; so, large\r\nmasses of argillaceous strata on the earth's interior may shrink, when\r\nsubjected to heat and chemical changes, and allow the incumbent rocks to\r\nsubside gradually.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if we suppose that lava cooling slowly at great depths may be\r\nconverted into various granitic rocks, we obtain another source of\r\ndepression; for, according to the experiments of Deville and the\r\ncalculations of Bischoff, the contraction of granite when passing from a\r\nmelted or plastic to a solid and crystalline state must be more than ten\r\nper cent.[788] The sudden subsidence of land may also be occasioned by\r\nsubterranean caverns giving way, when gases are condensed, or when they\r\nescape through newly-formed crevices. The subtraction, moreover, of\r\nmatter from certain parts of the interior, by the flowing of lava and of\r\nmineral springs, must, in the course of ages, cause vacuities below, so\r\nthat the undermined surface may at length fall in.\r\n\r\n_The balance of dry land, how preserved._--In the present state of our\r\nknowledge, we cannot pretend to estimate the average number of\r\nearthquakes which may happen in the course of a single year. As the area\r\nof the ocean is nearly three times that of the land, it is probable that\r\nabout three submarine earthquakes may occur for one exclusively\r\ncontinental; and when we consider the great frequency of slight\r\nmovements in certain districts, we can hardly suppose that a day, if,\r\nindeed, an hour, ever passes without one or more shocks being\r\nexperienced in some part of the globe. We have also seen that in Sweden,\r\nand other countries, changes in the relative level of sea and land may\r\ntake place without commotion, and these perhaps produce the most\r\nimportant geographical and geological changes; for the position of land\r\nmay be altered to a greater amount by an elevation or depression of one\r\ninch over a vast area, than by the sinking of a more limited tract, such\r\nas the forest of Aripao, to the depth of many fathoms at once.[789]\r\n\r\nIt must be evident, from the historical details above given, that the\r\nforce of subterranean movement, whether intermittent or continuous,\r\nwhether with or without disturbance, does not operate at random, but is\r\ndeveloped in certain regions only; and although the alterations produced\r\nduring the time required for the occurrence of a few volcanic eruptions\r\nmay be inconsiderable, we can hardly doubt that, during the ages\r\nnecessary for the formation of large volcanic cones, composed of\r\nthousands of lava currents, shoals might be converted into lofty\r\nmountains, and low lands into deep seas.\r\n\r\nIn a former chapter (p. 198), I have stated that aqueous and igneous\r\nagents may be regarded as antagonist forces; the aqueous laboring\r\nincessantly to reduce the inequalities of the earth's surface to a\r\nlevel, while the igneous are equally active in renewing the unevenness\r\nof the surface. By some geologists it has been thought that the\r\nlevelling power of running water was opposed rather to the _elevating_\r\nforce of earthquakes than to their action generally. This opinion is,\r\nhowever, untenable; for the sinking down of the bed of the ocean is one\r\nof the means by which the gradual submersion of land is prevented. The\r\ndepth of the sea cannot be increased at any one point without a\r\nuniversal fall of the waters, nor can any partial deposition of sediment\r\noccur without the displacement of a quantity of water of equal volume,\r\nwhich will raise the sea, though in an imperceptible degree, even to the\r\nantipodes. The preservation, therefore, of the dry land may sometimes be\r\neffected by the subsidence of part of the earth's crust (that part,\r\nnamely, which is covered by the ocean), and in like manner an upheaving\r\nmovement must often tend to destroy land; for if it render the bed of\r\nthe sea more shallow, it will displace a certain quantity of water, and\r\nthus tend to submerge low tracts.\r\n\r\nAstronomers having proved (see above, p. 129) that there has been no\r\nchange in the diameter of the earth during the last two thousand years,\r\nwe may assume it as probable, that the dimensions of the planet remain\r\nuniform. If, then, we inquire in what manner the force of earthquakes\r\nmust be regulated, in order to restore perpetually the inequalities of\r\nthe surface which the levelling power of water tends to efface, it will\r\nbe found, that the amount of depression must exceed that of elevation.\r\nIt would be otherwise if the action of volcanoes and mineral springs\r\nwere suspended; for then the forcing outwards of the earth's envelope\r\nought to be no more than equal to its sinking in.\r\n\r\nTo understand this proposition more clearly, it must be borne in mind,\r\nthat the deposits of rivers and currents probably add as much to the\r\nheight of lands which are rising, as they take from those which have\r\nrisen. Suppose a large river to bring down sediment to a part of the\r\nocean two thousand feet deep, and that the depth of this part is\r\ngradually reduced by the accumulation of sediment till only a shoal\r\nremains, covered by water at high tides; if now an upheaving force\r\nshould uplift this shoal to the height of 2000 feet, the result would be\r\na mountain 2000 feet high. But had the movement raised the same part of\r\nthe bottom of the sea before the sediment of the river had filled it up;\r\nthen, instead of changing a shoal into a mountain 2000 feet high, it\r\nwould only have converted a deep sea into a shoal.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that the operations of the earthquake are often such\r\nas to cause the levelling power of water to counteract itself; and,\r\nalthough the idea may appear paradoxical, we may be sure, wherever we\r\nfind hills and mountains composed of stratified deposits, that such\r\ninequalities of the surface would have had no existence if water, at\r\nsome former period, had not been laboring to reduce the earth's surface\r\nto one level.\r\n\r\nBut, besides the transfer of matter by running water from the continents\r\nto the ocean, there is a constant transportation from below upwards, by\r\nmineral springs and volcanic vents. As mountain masses are, in the\r\ncourse of ages, created by the pouring forth of successive streams of\r\nlava, so stratified rocks, of great extent, originate from the\r\ndeposition of carbonate of lime, and other mineral ingredients, with\r\nwhich springs are impregnated. The surface of the land, and portions of\r\nthe bottom of the sea, being thus raised, the external accessions due to\r\nthese operations would cause the dimensions of the planet to enlarge\r\ncontinually, if the amount of depression of the earth's crust were no\r\nmore than equal to the elevation. In order, therefore, that the mean\r\ndiameter of the earth should remain uniform, and the unevenness of the\r\nsurface be preserved, it is necessary that the amount of subsidence\r\nshould be in excess. And such a predominance of depression is far from\r\nimprobable, on mechanical principles, since every upheaving movement\r\nmust be expected either to produce caverns in the mass below, or to\r\ncause some diminution of its density. Vacuities must, also, arise from\r\nthe subtraction of the matter poured out from volcanoes and mineral\r\nsprings, or from the contraction of argillaceous masses by subterranean\r\nheat; and the foundations having been thus weakened, the earth's crust,\r\nshaken and rent by reiterated convulsions, must, in the course of time,\r\nfall in.\r\n\r\nIf we embrace these views, important geological consequences will\r\nfollow; since, if there be, upon the whole, more subsidence than\r\nelevation, the average depth to which former surfaces have sunk beneath\r\ntheir original level must exceed the height which ancient marine strata\r\nhave attained above the sea. If, for example, marine strata, about the\r\nage of our chalk and greensand, have been lifted up in Europe to an\r\nextreme height of more than eleven thousand feet, and a mean elevation\r\nof some hundreds, we may conclude that certain parts of the surface,\r\nwhich existed when those strata were deposited, have sunk to an extreme\r\ndepth of _more than_ eleven thousand feet below their original level,\r\nand to a mean depth of _more than_ a few hundreds.\r\n\r\nIn regard to faults, also, we must infer, according to the hypothesis\r\nnow proposed, that a greater number have arisen from the sinking down\r\nthan from the elevation of rocks.\r\n\r\nTo conclude: it seems to be rendered probable, by the views above\r\nexplained, that the constant repair of the land, and the subserviency of\r\nour planet to the support of terrestrial as well as aquatic species, are\r\nsecured by the elevating and depressing power of causes acting in the\r\ninterior of the earth; which, although so often the source of death and\r\nterror to the inhabitants of the globe--visiting in succession every\r\nzone, and filling the earth with monuments of ruin and disorder--are\r\nnevertheless the agents of a conservative principle above all others\r\nessential to the stability of the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nCHANGES OF THE ORGANIC WORLD NOW IN PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Division of the subject--Examination of the question, Whether\r\n    species have a real existence in nature?--Importance of this\r\n    question in geology--Sketch of Lamarck's arguments in favor of the\r\n    transmutation of species, and his conjectures respecting the origin\r\n    of existing animals and plants--His theory of the transformation of\r\n    the orang-outang into the human species.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last book, from chapters fourteen to thirty-three inclusive, was\r\noccupied with the consideration of the changes brought about on the\r\nearth's surface, within the period of human observation, by inorganic\r\nagents; such, for example, as rivers, marine currents, volcanoes, and\r\nearthquakes. But there is another class of phenomena relating to the\r\norganic world, which have an equal claim on our attention, if we desire\r\nto obtain possession of all the preparatory knowledge respecting the\r\nexisting course of nature, which may be available in the interpretation\r\nof geological monuments. It appeared from our preliminary sketch of the\r\nprogress of the science, that the most lively interest was excited among\r\nits earlier cultivators, by the discovery of the remains of animals and\r\nplants in the interior of mountains frequently remote from the sea. Much\r\ncontroversy arose respecting the nature of these remains, the causes\r\nwhich may have brought them into so singular a position, and the want of\r\na specific agreement between them and known animals and plants. To\r\nqualify ourselves to form just views on these curious questions, we must\r\nfirst study the present condition of the animate creation on the globe.\r\n\r\nThis branch of our inquiry naturally divides itself into two parts:\r\nfirst, we may examine the vicissitudes to which species are subject;\r\nsecondly, the processes by which certain individuals of these species\r\noccasionally become fossil. The first of these divisions will lead us,\r\namong other topics, to inquire, first, whether species have a real and\r\npermanent existence in nature? or whether they are capable, as some\r\nnaturalists pretend, of being indefinitely modified in the course of a\r\nlong series of generations? Secondly, whether, if species have a real\r\nexistence, the individuals composing them have been derived originally\r\nfrom many similar stocks, or each from one only, the descendants of\r\nwhich have spread themselves gradually from a particular point over the\r\nhabitable lands and waters? Thirdly, how far the duration of each\r\nspecies of animal and plant is limited by its dependence on certain\r\nfluctuating and temporary conditions in the state of the animate and\r\ninanimate world? Fourthly, whether there be proofs of the successive\r\nextermination of species in the ordinary course of nature, and whether\r\nthere be any reason for conjecturing that new animals and plants are\r\ncreated from time to time, to supply their place?\r\n\r\n_Whether species have a real existence in nature._--Before we can\r\nadvance a step in our proposed inquiry, we must be able to define\r\nprecisely the meaning which we attach to the term species. This is even\r\nmore necessary in geology than in the ordinary studies of the\r\nnaturalist; for they who deny that such a thing as a species exists,\r\nconcede nevertheless that a botanist or zoologist may reason as if the\r\nspecific character were constant, because they confine their\r\nobservations to a brief period of time. Just as the geographer, in\r\nconstructing his maps from century to century, may proceed as if the\r\napparent places of the fixed stars remained absolutely the same, and as\r\nif no alteration were brought about by the precession of the equinoxes;\r\nso, it is said, in the organic world, the stability of a species may be\r\ntaken as absolute, if we do not extend our views beyond the narrow\r\nperiod of human history; but let a sufficient number of centuries\r\nelapse, to allow of important revolutions in climate, physical\r\ngeography, and other circumstances, and the characters, say they, of the\r\ndescendants of common parents may deviate indefinitely from their\r\noriginal type.\r\n\r\nNow, if these doctrines be tenable, we are at once presented with a\r\nprinciple of incessant change in the organic world; and no degree of\r\ndissimilarity in the plants and animals which may formerly have existed,\r\nand are found fossil, would entitle us to conclude that they may not\r\nhave been the prototypes and progenitors of the species now living.\r\nAccordingly M. Geoffroy St. Hilaire has declared his opinion, that there\r\nhas been an uninterrupted succession in the animal kingdom, effected by\r\nmeans of generation, from the earliest ages of the world up to the\r\npresent day, and that the ancient animals whose remains have been\r\npreserved in the strata, however different, may nevertheless have been\r\nthe ancestors of those now in being. This notion is not very generally\r\nreceived, but we are not warranted in assuming the contrary, without\r\nfully explaining the data and reasoning by which it may be refuted.\r\n\r\nI shall begin by stating as concisely as possible all the facts and\r\ningenious arguments by which the theory has been supported; and for this\r\npurpose I cannot do better than offer the reader a rapid sketch of\r\nLamarck's statement of the proofs which he regards as confirmatory of\r\nthe doctrine, and which he has derived partly from the works of his\r\npredecessors and in part from original investigations.\r\n\r\nHis proofs and inferences will be best considered in the order in which\r\nthey appear to have influenced his mind, and I shall then point out some\r\nof the results to which he was led while boldly following out his\r\nprinciples to their legitimate consequences.\r\n\r\n_Lamarck's arguments in favor of the transmutation of species._--The\r\nname of species, observes Lamarck, has been usually applied to \"every\r\ncollection of similar individuals produced by other individuals like\r\nthemselves.\"[790] This definition, he admits, is correct; because every\r\nliving individual bears a very close resemblance to those from which it\r\nsprings. But this is not all which is usually implied by the term\r\nspecies; for the majority of naturalists agree with Linnaeus in supposing\r\nthat all the individuals propagated from one stock have certain\r\ndistinguishing characters in common, which will never vary, and which\r\nhave remained the same since the creation of each species.\r\n\r\nIn order to shake this opinion, Lamarck enters upon the following line\r\nof argument:--The more we advance in the knowledge of the different\r\norganized bodies which cover the surface of the globe, the more our\r\nembarrassment increases, to determine what ought to be regarded as a\r\nspecies, and still more how to limit and distinguish genera. In\r\nproportion as our collections are enriched, we see almost every void\r\nfilled up, and all our lines of separation effaced! We are reduced to\r\narbitrary determinations, and are sometimes fain to seize upon the\r\nslight differences of mere varieties, in order to form characters for\r\nwhat we choose to call a species; and sometimes we are induced to\r\npronounce individuals but slightly differing, and which others regard as\r\ntrue species, to be varieties.\r\n\r\nThe greater the abundance of natural objects assembled together, the\r\nmore do we discover proofs that every thing passes by insensible shades\r\ninto something else; that even the more remarkable differences are\r\nevanescent, and that nature has, for the most part, left us nothing at\r\nour disposal for establishing distinctions, save trifling, and, in some\r\nrespects, puerile particularities.\r\n\r\nWe find that many genera amongst animals and plants are of such an\r\nextent, in consequence of the number of species referred to them, that\r\nthe study and determination of these last has become almost\r\nimpracticable. When the species are arranged in a series, and placed\r\nnear to each other, with due regard to their natural affinities, they\r\neach differ in so minute a degree from those next adjoining, that they\r\nalmost melt into each other, and are in a manner confounded together. If\r\nwe see isolated species, we may presume the absence of some more closely\r\nconnected, and which have not yet been discovered. Already are there\r\ngenera, and even entire orders--nay, whole classes, which present an\r\napproximation to the state of things here indicated.\r\n\r\nIf, when species have been thus placed in a regular series, we select\r\none, and then, making a leap over several intermediate ones, we take a\r\nsecond, at some distance from the first, these two will, on comparison,\r\nbe seen to be very dissimilar; and it is in this manner that every\r\nnaturalist begins to study the objects which are at his own door. He\r\nthen finds it an easy task to establish generic and specific\r\ndistinctions; and it is only when his experience is enlarged, and when\r\nhe has made himself master of the intermediate links, that his\r\ndifficulties and ambiguities begin. But while we are thus compelled to\r\nresort to trifling and minute characters in our attempt to separate the\r\nspecies, we find a striking disparity between individuals which we know\r\nto have descended from a common stock; and these newly acquired\r\npeculiarities are regularly transmitted from one generation to another,\r\nconstituting what are called _races_.\r\n\r\nFrom a great number of facts, continues the author, we learn that in\r\nproportion as the individuals of one of our species change their\r\nsituation, climate, and manner of living, they change also, by little\r\nand little, the consistence and proportions of their parts, their form,\r\ntheir faculties, and even their organization, in such a manner that\r\nevery thing in them comes at last to participate in the mutations to\r\nwhich they have been exposed. Even in the same climate, a great\r\ndifference of situation and exposure causes individuals to vary; but if\r\nthese individuals continue to live and to be reproduced under the same\r\ndifference of circumstances, distinctions are brought about in them\r\nwhich become in some degree essential to their existence. In a word, at\r\nthe end of many successive generations, these individuals, which\r\noriginally belonged to another species, are transformed into a new and\r\ndistinct species.[791]\r\n\r\nThus, for example, if the seeds of a grass, or any other plant which\r\ngrows naturally in a moist meadow, be accidentally transported, first to\r\nthe slope of some neighboring hill, where the soil, although at a\r\ngreater elevation, is damp enough to allow the plant to live; and if,\r\nafter having lived there, and having been several times regenerated, it\r\nreaches by degrees the drier and almost arid soil of a mountain\r\ndeclivity, it will then, if it succeeds in growing, and perpetuates\r\nitself for a series of generations, be so changed that botanists who\r\nmeet with it will regard it as a particular species.[792] The\r\nunfavorable climate in this case, deficiency of nourishment, exposure to\r\nthe winds, and other causes, give rise to a stunted and dwarfish race,\r\nwith some organ more developed than others, and having proportions often\r\nquite peculiar.\r\n\r\nWhat nature brings about in a great lapse of time, we occasion suddenly\r\nby changing the circumstances in which a species has been accustomed to\r\nlive. All are aware that vegetables taken from their birthplace, and\r\ncultivated in gardens, undergo changes which render them no longer\r\nrecognizable as the same plants. Many which were naturally hairy become\r\nsmooth, or nearly so; a great number of such as were creepers and\r\ntrailed along the ground, rear their stalks and grow erect. Others lose\r\ntheir thorns or asperities; others, again, from the ligneous state which\r\ntheir stem possessed in hot climates, where they were indigenous, pass\r\nto the herbaceous; and, among them, some which were perennials become\r\nmere annuals. So well do botanists know the effects of such changes of\r\ncircumstances, that they are averse to describe species from garden\r\nspecimens, unless they are sure that they have been cultivated for a\r\nvery short period.\r\n\r\n\"Is not the cultivated wheat\" (_Triticum sativum_), asks Lamarck, \"a\r\nvegetable brought by man into the state in which we now see it? Let any\r\none tell me in what country a similar plant grows wild, unless where it\r\nhas escaped from cultivated fields? Where do we find in nature our\r\ncabbages, lettuces, and other culinary vegetables, in the state in which\r\nthey appear in our gardens? Is it not the same in regard to a great\r\nquantity of animals which domesticity has changed or considerably\r\nmodified?\"[793] Our domestic fowls and pigeons are unlike any wild\r\nbirds. Our domestic ducks and geese have lost the faculty of raising\r\nthemselves into the higher regions of the air, and crossing extensive\r\ncountries in their flight, like the wild ducks and wild geese from which\r\nthey were originally derived. A bird which we breed in a cage cannot,\r\nwhen restored to liberty, fly like others of the same species which have\r\nbeen always free. This small alteration of circumstances, however, has\r\nonly diminished the power of flight, without modifying the form of any\r\npart of the wings. But when individuals of the same race are retained in\r\ncaptivity during a considerable length of time, the form even of their\r\nparts is gradually made to differ, especially if climate, nourishment,\r\nand other circumstances be also altered.\r\n\r\nThe numerous races of dogs which we have produced by domesticity are\r\nnowhere to be found in a wild state. In nature we should seek in vain\r\nfor mastiffs, harriers, spaniels, greyhounds, and other races, between\r\nwhich the differences are sometimes so great that they would be readily\r\nadmitted as specific between wild animals; \"yet all these have sprung\r\noriginally from a single race, at first approaching very near to a wolf,\r\nif, indeed, the wolf be not the true type which at some period or other\r\nwas domesticated by man.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough important changes in the nature of the places which they\r\ninhabit modify the organization of animals as well as vegetables; yet\r\nthe former, says Lamarck, require more time to complete a considerable\r\ndegree of transmutation; and, consequently, we are less sensible of such\r\noccurrences. Next to a diversity of the medium in which animals or\r\nplants may live, the circumstances which have most influence in\r\nmodifying their organs are differences in exposure, climate, the nature\r\nof the soil, and other local particulars. These circumstances are as\r\nvaried as are the characters of the species, and, like them, pass by\r\ninsensible shades into each other, there being every intermediate\r\ngradation between the opposite extremes. But each locality remains for a\r\nvery long time the same, and is altered so slowly that we can only\r\nbecome conscious of the reality of the change by consulting geological\r\nmonuments, by which we learn that the order of things which how reigns\r\nin each place has not always prevailed, and by inference anticipate that\r\nit will not always continue the same.[794]\r\n\r\nEvery considerable alteration in the local circumstances in which each\r\nrace of animals exists causes a change in their wants, and these new\r\nwants excite them to new actions and habits. These actions require the\r\nmore frequent employment of some parts before but slightly exercised,\r\nand then greater development follows as a consequence of their more\r\nfrequent use. Other organs no longer in use are impoverished and\r\ndiminished in size, nay, are sometimes entirely annihilated, while in\r\ntheir place new parts are insensibly produced for the discharge of new\r\nfunctions.[795]\r\n\r\nI must here interrupt the author's argument, by observing, that no\r\npositive fact is cited to exemplify the substitution of some _entirely\r\nnew_ sense, faculty, or organ, in the room of some other suppressed as\r\nuseless. All the instances adduced go only to prove that the dimensions\r\nand strength of members and the perfection of certain attributes may, in\r\na long succession of generations, be lessened and enfeebled by disuse;\r\nor, on the contrary, be matured and augmented by active exertion; just\r\nas we know that the power of scent is feeble in the greyhound, while its\r\nswiftness of pace and its acuteness of sight are remarkable--that the\r\nharrier and stag-hound, on the contrary, are comparatively slow in their\r\nmovements, but excel in the sense of smelling.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to point out to the reader this important chasm in the\r\nchain of evidence, because he might otherwise imagine that I had merely\r\nomitted the illustrations for the sake of brevity; but the plain truth\r\nis, that there were no examples to be found; and when Lamarck talks \"of\r\nthe efforts of internal sentiment,\" \"the influence of subtle fluids,\"\r\nand \"acts of organization,\" as causes whereby animals and plants may\r\nacquire _new organs_, he substitutes names for things; and, with a\r\ndisregard to the strict rules of induction, resorts to fictions, as\r\nideal as the \"plastic virtue,\" and other phantoms of the geologists of\r\nthe middle ages.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, if some well-authenticated facts could have been\r\nadduced to establish one complete step in the process of transformation,\r\nsuch as the appearance, in individuals descending from a common stock,\r\nof a sense or organ entirely new, and a complete disappearance of some\r\nother enjoyed by their progenitors, time alone might then be supposed\r\nsufficient to bring about any amount of metamorphosis. The gratuitous\r\nassumption, therefore, of a point so vital to the theory of\r\ntransmutation, was unpardonable on the part of its advocate.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed with the system: it being assumed as an undoubted fact,\r\nthat a change of external circumstances may cause one organ to become\r\nentirely obsolete, and a new one to be developed, such as never before\r\nbelonged to the species, the following proposition is announced, which,\r\nhowever staggering and absurd it may seem, is logically deduced from the\r\nassumed premises. It is not the organs, or, in other words, the nature\r\nand form of the parts of the body of an animal, which have given rise to\r\nits habits, and its particular faculties; but, on the contrary, its\r\nhabits, its manner of living, and those of its progenitors, have in the\r\ncourse of time determined the form of its body, the number and condition\r\nof its organs--in short, the faculties which it enjoys. Thus otters,\r\nbeavers, waterfowl, turtles, and frogs, were not made web-footed in\r\norder that they might swim; but their wants having attracted them to the\r\nwater in search of prey, they stretched out the toes of their feet to\r\nstrike the water and move rapidly along its surface. By the repeated\r\nstretching of their toes, the skin which united them at the base\r\nacquired a habit of extension, until, in the course of time, the broad\r\nmembranes which now connect their extremities were formed.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the antelope and the gazelle were not endowed with light\r\nagile forms, in order that they might escape by flight from carnivorous\r\nanimals; but, having been exposed to the danger of being devoured by\r\nlions, tigers, and other beasts of prey, they were compelled to exert\r\nthemselves in running with great celerity; a habit which, in the course\r\nof many generations, gave rise to the peculiar slenderness of their\r\nlegs, and the agility and elegance of their forms.\r\n\r\nThe camelopard was not gifted with a long flexible neck because it was\r\ndestined to live in the interior of Africa, where the soil was arid and\r\ndevoid of herbage; but, being reduced by the nature of that country to\r\nsupport itself on the foliage of lofty trees, it contracted a habit of\r\nstretching itself up to reach the high boughs, until its neck became so\r\nelongated that it could raise its head to the height of twenty feet\r\nabove the ground.\r\n\r\nAnother line of argument is then entered upon, in farther corroboration\r\nof the instability of species. In order, it is said, that individuals\r\nshould perpetuate themselves unaltered by generation, those belonging to\r\none species ought never to ally themselves to those of another; but such\r\nsexual unions do take place, both among plants and animals; and although\r\nthe offspring of such irregular connections are usually sterile, yet\r\nsuch is not always the case. Hybrids have sometimes proved prolific,\r\nwhere the disparity between the species was not too great; and by this\r\nmeans alone, says Lamarck, varieties may gradually be created by near\r\nalliances, which would become races, and in the course of time would\r\nconstitute what we term species.[796]\r\n\r\nBut if the soundness of all these arguments and inferences be admitted,\r\nwe are next to inquire, what were the original types of form,\r\norganization, and instinct, from which the diversities of character, as\r\nnow exhibited by animals and plants, have been derived? We know that\r\nindividuals which are mere varieties of the same species would, if their\r\npedigree could be traced back far enough, terminate in a single stock;\r\nso, according to the train of reasoning before described, the species of\r\na genus, and even the genera of a great family, must have had a common\r\npoint of departure. What, then, was the single stem from which so many\r\nvarieties of form have ramified? Were there many of these, or are we to\r\nrefer the origin of the whole animate creation, as the Egyptian priests\r\ndid that of the universe, to a single egg?\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any positive data for framing a theory on so obscure a\r\nsubject, the following considerations were deemed of importance to guide\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, if we examine the whole series of known animals,\r\nfrom one extremity to the other, when they are arranged in the order of\r\ntheir natural relations, we find that we may pass progressively, or, at\r\nleast, with very few interruptions, from beings of more simple to those\r\nof a more compound structure; and, in proportion as the complexity of\r\ntheir organization increases, the number and dignity of their faculties\r\nincrease also. Among plants, a similar approximation to a graduated\r\nscale of being is apparent, Secondly, it appears, from geological\r\nobservations, that plants and animals of more simple organization\r\nexisted on the globe before the appearance of those of more compound\r\nstructure, and the latter were successively formed at more modern\r\nperiods; each new race being more fully developed than the most perfect\r\nof the preceding era.\r\n\r\nOf the truth of the last-mentioned geological theory, Lamarck seems to\r\nhave been fully persuaded; and he also shows that he was deeply\r\nimpressed with a belief prevalent amongst the older naturalists, that\r\nthe primeval ocean invested the whole planet long after it became the\r\nhabitation of living beings; and thus he was inclined to assert the\r\npriority of the types of marine animals to those of the terrestrial, so\r\nas to fancy, for example, that the testacea of the ocean existed first,\r\nuntil some of them, by gradual evolution, were _improved_ into those\r\ninhabiting the land.\r\n\r\nThese speculative views had already been, in a great degree, anticipated\r\nby Demaillet in his Telliamed, and by several modern writers; so that\r\nthe tables were completely turned on the philosophers of antiquity, with\r\nwhom it was a received maxim, that created things were always most\r\nperfect when they came first from the hands of their Maker; and that\r\nthere was a tendency to progressive deterioration in sublunary things\r\nwhen left to themselves--\r\n\r\n\r\n        ----omnia fatis\r\n  In pejus ruere, ac retro sublapsa referri.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo deeply was the faith of the ancient schools of philosophy imbued with\r\nthis doctrine, that, to check this universal proneness to degeneracy,\r\nnothing less than the reintervention of the Deity was thought adequate;\r\nand it was held, that thereby the order, excellence, and pristine energy\r\nof the moral and physical world had been repeatedly restored.\r\n\r\nBut when the possibility of the indefinite modification of individuals\r\ndescending from common parents was once assumed, as also the geological\r\ninference respecting the progressive development of organic life, it was\r\nnatural that the ancient dogma should be rejected, or rather reversed,\r\nand that the most simple and imperfect forms and faculties should be\r\nconceived to have been the originals whence all others were developed.\r\nAccordingly, in conformity to these views, inert matter was supposed to\r\nhave been first endowed with life; until, in the course of ages,\r\nsensation was superadded to mere vitality: sight, hearing, and the\r\nother senses were afterwards acquired; then instinct and the mental\r\nfaculties; until, finally, by virtue of the tendency of things to\r\n_progressive improvement_, the irrational was developed in the rational.\r\n\r\nThe reader, however, will immediately perceive that when all the higher\r\norders of plants and animals were thus supposed to be comparatively\r\nmodern, and to have been derived in a long series of generations from\r\nthose of more simple conformation, some farther hypothesis became\r\nindispensable, in order to explain why, after an indefinite lapse of\r\nages, there were still so many beings of the simplest structure. Why\r\nhave the majority of existing creatures remained stationary throughout\r\nthis long succession of epochs, while others have made such prodigious\r\nadvances? Why are there such multitudes of infusoria and polyps, or of\r\nconfervae and other cryptogamic plants? Why, moreover, has the process of\r\ndevelopment acted with such unequal and irregular force on those classes\r\nof beings which have been greatly perfected, so that there are wide\r\nchasms in the series; gaps so enormous, that Lamarck fairly admits we\r\ncan never expect to fill them up by future discoveries?\r\n\r\nThe following hypothesis was provided to meet these objections. Nature,\r\nwe are told, is not an intelligence, nor the Deity; but a delegated\r\npower--a mere instrument--a piece of mechanism acting by necessity--an\r\norder of things constituted by the Supreme Being, and subject to laws\r\nwhich are the expressions of his will. This Nature is _obliged_ to\r\nproceed gradually in all her operations; she cannot produce animals and\r\nplants of all classes at once, but must always begin by the formation of\r\nthe most simple kinds, and out of them elaborate the more compound,\r\nadding to them, successively, different systems of organs, and\r\nmultiplying more and more their number and energy.\r\n\r\nThis nature is daily engaged in the formation of the elementary\r\nrudiments of animal and vegetable existence, which correspond to what\r\nthe ancients termed _spontaneous generation_. She is always beginning\r\nanew, day by day, the work of creation, by forming monads, or \"rough\r\ndraughts\" (abauches), which are the only living things she gives birth\r\nto _directly_.\r\n\r\nThere are distinct primary rudiments of plants and animals, and\r\n_probably_ of each of the great divisions of the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdoms.[797] These are gradually developed into the higher and more\r\nperfect classes by the slow but unceasing agency of two influential\r\nprinciples: first, _the tendency to progressive advancement_ in\r\norganization, accompanied by greater dignity in instinct, intelligence,\r\n&c.; secondly, _the force of external circumstances_, or of variations\r\nin the physical condition of the earth, or the mutual relations of\r\nplants and animals. For, as species spread themselves gradually over the\r\nglobe, they are exposed from time to time to variations in climate, and\r\nto changes in the quantity and quality of their food; they meet with new\r\nplants and animals which assist or retard their development, by\r\nsupplying them with nutriment, or destroying their foes. The nature,\r\nalso, of each locality, is in itself fluctuating; so that, even if the\r\nrelation of other animals and plants were invariable, the habits and\r\norganization of species would be modified by the influence of local\r\nrevolutions.\r\n\r\nNow, if the first of these principles, _the tendency to progressive\r\ndevelopment_, were left to exert itself with perfect freedom, it would\r\ngive rise, says Lamarck, in the course of ages, to a graduated scale of\r\nbeing, where the most insensible transition might be traced from the\r\nsimplest to the most compound structure, from the humblest to the most\r\nexalted degree of intelligence. But, in consequence of the perpetual\r\ninterference of the _external causes_ before mentioned, this regular\r\norder is greatly interfered with, and an approximation only to such a\r\nstate of things is exhibited by the animate creation, the progress of\r\nsome races being retarded by unfavorable, and that of others accelerated\r\nby favorable, combinations of circumstances. Hence, all kinds of\r\nanomalies interrupt the continuity of the plan; and chasms, into which\r\nwhole genera or families might be inserted, are seen to separate the\r\nnearest existing portions of the series.\r\n\r\n_Lamarck's theory of the transformation of the orang-outang into the\r\nhuman species._--Such is the machinery of the Lamarckian system; but the\r\nreader will hardly, perhaps, be able to form a perfect conception of so\r\ncomplicated a piece of mechanism, unless it is exhibited in motion, so\r\nthat we may see in what manner it can work out, under the author's\r\nguidance, all the extraordinary effects which we behold in the present\r\nstate of the animate creation. I have only space for exhibiting a small\r\npart of the entire process by which a complete metamorphosis is\r\nachieved, and shall therefore omit the mode by which, after a countless\r\nsuccession of generations, a small gelatinous body is transformed into\r\nan oak or an ape; passing on at once to the last grand step in the\r\nprogressive scheme, by which the orang-outang, having been already\r\nevolved out of a monad, is made slowly to attain the attributes and\r\ndignity of man.\r\n\r\nOne of the races of quadrumanous animals which had reached the highest\r\nstate of perfection, lost, by constraint of circumstances (concerning\r\nthe exact nature of which tradition is unfortunately silent), the habit\r\nof climbing trees, and of hanging on by grasping the boughs with their\r\nfeet as with hands. The individuals of this race being obliged, for a\r\nlong series of generations, to use their feet exclusively for walking,\r\nand ceasing to employ their hands as feet, were transformed into\r\nbimanous animals, and what before were thumbs became mere toes, no\r\nseparation being required when their feet were used solely for walking.\r\nHaving acquired a habit of holding themselves upright, their legs and\r\nfeet assumed, insensibly, a conformation fitted to support them in an\r\nerect attitude, till at last these animals could no longer go on\r\nall-fours without much inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe Angola orang (_Simia troglodytes_, Linn.) is the most perfect of\r\nanimals; much more so than the Indian orang (_Simia Satyrus_), which has\r\nbeen called the orang-outang, although _both_ are _very inferior_ to man\r\nin corporeal powers and intelligence. These animals frequently hold\r\nthemselves upright; but their organization has _not yet_ been\r\nsufficiently modified to sustain them habitually in this attitude, so\r\nthat the standing posture is very uneasy to them. When the Indian orang\r\nis compelled to take flight from pressing danger, he immediately falls\r\ndown upon all-fours, showing clearly that this was the original position\r\nof the animal. Even in man, whose organization, in the course of a long\r\nseries of generations, has advanced so much farther, the upright posture\r\nis fatiguing, and can be supported only for a limited time, and by aid\r\nof the contraction of many muscles. If the vertebral column formed the\r\naxis of the human body, and supported the head and all the other parts\r\nin equilibrium, then might the upright position be a state of repose:\r\nbut, as the human head does not articulate in the centre of gravity, as\r\nthe chest, belly, and other parts press almost entirely forward with\r\ntheir whole weight, and as the vertebral column reposes upon an oblique\r\nbase, a watchful activity is required to prevent the body from falling.\r\nChildren who have large heads and prominent bellies can hardly walk at\r\nthe end even of two years; and their frequent tumbles indicate the\r\nnatural tendency in man to resume the quadrupedal state.\r\n\r\nNow, when so much progress had been made by the quadrumanous animals\r\nbefore mentioned, that they could hold themselves habitually in an erect\r\nattitude, and were accustomed to a wide range of vision, and ceased to\r\nuse their jaws for fighting and tearing, or for clipping herbs for food,\r\ntheir snout became gradually shorter, their incisor teeth became\r\nvertical, and the facial angle grew more open.\r\n\r\nAmong other ideas which the natural _tendency to perfection_ engendered,\r\nthe desire of ruling suggested itself, and this race succeeded at length\r\nin getting the better of the other animals, and made themselves masters\r\nof all those spots on the surface of the globe which best suited them.\r\nThey drove out the animals which approached nearest them in organization\r\nand intelligence, and which were in a condition to dispute with them the\r\ngood things of this world, forcing them to take refuge in deserts,\r\nwoods, and wildernesses, where their multiplication was checked, and the\r\nprogressive development of their faculties retarded; while, in the mean\r\ntime, the dominant race spread itself in every direction, and lived in\r\nlarge companies, where new wants were successively created, exciting\r\nthem to industry, and gradually perfecting their means and faculties.\r\n\r\nIn the supremacy and increased intelligence acquired by the ruling race,\r\nwe see an illustration of the natural tendency of the organic world to\r\ngrow more perfect; and, in their influence in repressing the advance of\r\nothers, an example of one of those disturbing causes before enumerated,\r\nthat _force of external circumstances_ which causes such wide chasms in\r\nthe regular series of animated being.\r\n\r\nWhen the individuals of the dominant race became very numerous, their\r\nideas greatly increased in number, and they felt the necessity of\r\ncommunicating them to each other, and of augmenting and varying the\r\nsigns proper for the communication of ideas. Meanwhile the inferior\r\nquadrumanous animals, although most of them were gregarious, acquired no\r\nnew ideas, being persecuted and restless in the deserts, and obliged to\r\nfly and conceal themselves, so that they conceived no new wants. Such\r\nideas as they already had remained unaltered, and they could dispense\r\nwith the communication of the greater part of these. To make themselves,\r\ntherefore, understood by their fellows, required merely a few movements\r\nof the body or limbs--whistling, and the uttering of certain cries\r\nvaried by the inflexions of the voice.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the individuals of the ascendant race, animated with a\r\ndesire of interchanging their ideas, which became more and more\r\nnumerous, were prompted to multiply the means of communication, and were\r\nno longer satisfied with mere pantomimic signs, nor even with all the\r\npossible inflexions of the voice, but made continual efforts to acquire\r\nthe power of uttering articulate sounds, employing a few at first, but\r\nafterwards varying and perfecting them according to the increase of\r\ntheir wants. The habitual exercise of their throat, tongue, and lips,\r\ninsensibly modified the conformation of these organs, until they became\r\nfitted for the faculty of speech.[798]\r\n\r\nIn effecting this mighty change, \"the exigencies of the individuals were\r\nthe sole agents; they gave rise to efforts, and the organs proper for\r\narticulating sounds were developed by their habitual employment.\" Hence,\r\nin this peculiar race, the origin of the admirable faculty of speech;\r\nhence also the diversity of languages, since the distance of places\r\nwhere the individuals composing the race established themselves soon\r\nfavored the corruption of conventional signs.[799]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be proper to observe that the above sketch of the\r\nLamarckian theory is no exaggerated picture, and those passages which\r\nhave probably excited the greatest surprise in the mind of the reader\r\nare literal translations from the original.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nTRANSMUTATION OF SPECIES--_Continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Recapitulation of the arguments in favor of the theory of\r\n    transmutation of species--Their insufficiency--Causes of difficulty\r\n    in discriminating species--Some varieties possibly more distinct\r\n    than certain individuals of distinct species--Variability in a\r\n    species consistent with a belief that the limits of deviation are\r\n    fixed--No facts of transmutation authenticated--Varieties of the\r\n    Dog--the Dog and Wolf distinct species--Mummies of various animals\r\n    from Egypt identical in character with living individuals--Seeds and\r\n    plants from the Egyptian tombs--Modifications produced in plants by\r\n    agriculture and gardening.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory of the transmutation of species, considered in the last\r\nchapter, has met with some degree of favor from many naturalists, from\r\ntheir desire to dispense, as far as possible, with the repeated\r\nintervention of a First Cause, as often as geological monuments attest\r\nthe successive appearance of new races of animals and plants, and the\r\nextinction of those pre-existing. But, independently of a predisposition\r\nto account, if possible, for a series of changes in the organic world by\r\nthe regular action of secondary causes, we have seen that in truth many\r\nperplexing difficulties present themselves to one who attempts to\r\nestablish the nature and reality of the specific character. And if once\r\nthere appears ground of reasonable doubt, in regard to the constancy of\r\nspecies, the amount of transformation which they are capable of\r\nundergoing may seem to resolve itself into a mere question of the\r\nquantity of time assigned to the past duration of animate existence.\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the reasons which may be adduced for rejecting\r\nLamarck's hypothesis, I shall recapitulate, in a few words, the\r\nphenomena, and the whole train of thought, by which I conceive it to\r\nhave been suggested, and which have gained for this and analogous\r\ntheories, both in ancient and modern times, a considerable number of\r\nvotaries.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the various groups into which plants and animals may\r\nbe thrown seem almost invariably, to a beginner, to be so natural, that\r\nhe is usually convinced at first, as was Linnaeus to the last, \"that\r\ngenera are as much founded in nature as the species which compose\r\nthem.\"[800] When by examining the numerous intermediate gradations the\r\nstudent finds all lines of demarcation to be in most instances\r\nobliterated, even where they at first appeared most distinct, he grows\r\nmore and more sceptical as to the real existence of genera, and finally\r\nregards them as mere arbitrary and artificial signs, invented, like\r\nthose which serve to distinguish the heavenly constellations, for the\r\nconvenience of classification, and having as little pretensions to\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nDoubts are then engendered in his mind as to whether species may not\r\nalso be equally unreal. The student is probably first struck with the\r\nphenomenon, that some individuals are made to deviate widely from the\r\nordinary type by the force of peculiar circumstances, and with the still\r\nmore extraordinary fact, that the newly acquired peculiarities are\r\nfaithfully transmitted to the offspring. How far, he asks, may such\r\nvariations extend in the course of indefinite periods of time, and\r\nduring great vicissitudes in the physical condition of the globe? His\r\ngrowing incertitude is at first checked by the reflection that nature\r\nhas forbidden the intermixture of the descendants of distinct original\r\nstocks, or has, at least, entailed sterility on their offspring, thereby\r\npreventing their being confounded together, and pointing out that a\r\nmultitude of distinct types must have been created in the beginning, and\r\nmust have remained pure and uncorrupted to this day.\r\n\r\nRelying on this general law, he endeavors to solve each difficult\r\nproblem by direct experiment, until he is again astounded by the\r\nphenomenon of a prolific hybrid, and still more by an example of a\r\nhybrid perpetuating itself throughout several generations in the\r\nvegetable world. He then feels himself reduced to the dilemma of\r\nchoosing between two alternatives; either to reject the test, or to\r\ndeclare that the two species, from the union of which the fruitful\r\nprogeny has sprung, were mere varieties. If he prefer the latter, he is\r\ncompelled to question the reality of the distinctness of all other\r\nsupposed species which differ no more than the parents of such prolific\r\nhybrids; for although he may not be enabled immediately to procure, in\r\nall such instances, a fruitful offspring; yet experiments show, that\r\nafter repeated failures, the union of two recognized species may at\r\nlast, under very favorable circumstances, give birth to a fertile\r\nprogeny. Such circumstances, therefore, the naturalist may conceive to\r\nhave occurred again and again, in the course of a great lapse of ages.\r\n\r\nHis first opinions are now fairly unsettled, and every stay at which he\r\nhas caught has given way one after another; he is in danger of falling\r\ninto any new and visionary doctrine which may be presented to him; for\r\nhe now regards every part of the animate creation as void of stability,\r\nand in a state of continual flux. In this mood he encounters the\r\nGeologist, who relates to him how there have been endless vicissitudes\r\nin the shape and structure of organic beings in former ages--how the\r\napproach to the present system of things has been gradual--that there\r\nhas been a progressive development of organization subservient to the\r\npurposes of life, from the most simple to the most complex state--that\r\nthe appearance of man is the last phenomenon in a long succession of\r\nevents--and, finally, that a series of physical revolutions can be\r\ntraced in the inorganic world, coeval and co-extensive with those of\r\norganic nature.\r\n\r\nThese views seem immediately to confirm all his preconceived doubts as\r\nto the stability of the specific character, and he begins to think there\r\nmay exist an inseparable connection between a series of changes in the\r\ninanimate world, and the capability of the species to be indefinitely\r\nmodified by the influence of external circumstances. Henceforth his\r\nspeculations know no definite bounds; he gives the rein to conjecture,\r\nand fancies that the outward form, internal structure, instinctive\r\nfaculties, nay, that reason itself may have been gradually developed\r\nfrom some of the simplest states of existence--that all animals, that\r\nman himself, and the irrational beings, may have had one common origin;\r\nthat all may be parts of one continuous and progressive scheme of\r\ndevelopment, from the most imperfect to the more complex; in fine, he\r\nrenounces his belief in the high genealogy of his species, and looks\r\nforward, as if in compensation, to the future perfectibility of man in\r\nhis physical, intellectual, and moral attributes.\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed to consider what is defective in evidence, and what\r\nfallacious in reasoning, in the grounds of these strange conclusions.\r\nBlumenbach judiciously observes, that \"no general rule can be laid down\r\nfor determining the distinctness of species, as there is no particular\r\nclass of characters which can serve as a criterion. In each case we must\r\nbe guided by _analogy_ and _probability_.\" The multitude, in fact, and\r\ncomplexity of the proofs to be weighed is so great, that we can only\r\nhope to obtain presumptive evidence, and we must, therefore, be the more\r\ncareful to derive our general views as much as possible from those\r\nobservations where the chances of deception are least. We must be on our\r\nguard not to tread in the footsteps of the naturalists of the middle\r\nages, who believed the doctrine of spontaneous generation to be\r\napplicable to all those parts of the animal and vegetable kingdoms which\r\nthey least understood, in direct contradiction to the analogy of all the\r\nparts best known to them; and who, when at length they found that\r\ninsects and cryptogamous plants were also propagated from eggs or seeds,\r\nstill persisted in retaining their old prejudices respecting the\r\ninfusory animalcules and other minute beings, the generation of which\r\nhad not then been demonstrated by the microscope to be governed by the\r\nsame laws.\r\n\r\nLamarck has, indeed, attempted to raise an argument in favor of his\r\nsystem, out of the very confusion which has arisen in the study of some\r\norders of animals and plants, in consequence of the slight shades of\r\ndifference which separate the new species discovered within the last\r\nhalf century. That the embarrassment of those who attempt to classify\r\nand distinguish the new acquisitions, poured in such multitudes into our\r\nmuseums, should increase with the augmentation of their number, is quite\r\nnatural; since to obviate this, it is not enough that our powers of\r\ndiscrimination should keep pace with the increase of the objects, but we\r\nought to possess greater opportunities of studying each animal and plant\r\nin all stages of its growth, and to know profoundly their history, their\r\nhabits, and physiological characters, throughout several generations;\r\nfor, in proportion as the series of known animals grows more complete\r\nnone can doubt there is a nearer approximation to a graduated scale of\r\nbeing; and thus the most closely allied species will be found to possess\r\na greater number of characters in common.\r\n\r\n_Causes of the difficulty of discriminating species._--But, in point of\r\nfact, our new acquisitions consist, more and more as we advance, of\r\nspecimens brought from foreign and often very distant and barbarous\r\ncountries. A large proportion have never even been seen alive by\r\nscientific inquirers. Instead of having specimens of the young, the\r\nadult, and the aged individuals of each sex, and possessing means of\r\ninvestigating the anatomical structure, the peculiar habits, and\r\ninstincts of each, what is usually the state of our information? A\r\nsingle specimen, perhaps, of a dried plant, or a stuffed bird or\r\nquadruped; a shell, without the soft parts of the animal; an insect in\r\none stage of its numerous transformations;--these are the scanty and\r\nimperfect data which the naturalist possesses. Such information may\r\nenable us to separate species which stand at a considerable distance\r\nfrom each other; but we have no right to expect any thing but difficulty\r\nand ambiguity, if we attempt, from such imperfect opportunities, to\r\nobtain distinctive marks for defining the characters of species which\r\nare closely related.\r\n\r\nIf Lamarck could introduce so much certainty and precision into the\r\nclassification of several thousand species of recent and fossil shells,\r\nnotwithstanding the extreme remoteness of the organization of these\r\nanimals from the type of those vertebrated species which are best known,\r\nand in the absence of so many of the living inhabitants of shells, we\r\nare led to form an exalted conception of the degree of exactness to\r\nwhich specific distinctions are capable of being carried, rather than to\r\ncall in question their reality.\r\n\r\nWhen our data are so defective, the most acute naturalist must expect to\r\nbe sometimes at fault, and, like the novice, to overlook essential\r\npoints of difference, passing unconsciously from one species to another,\r\nuntil, like one who is borne along in a current, he is astonished on\r\nlooking back, at observing that he has reached a point so remote from\r\nthat whence he set out.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means improbable, that, when the series of species of\r\ncertain genera is very full, they may be found to differ less widely\r\nfrom each other than do the mere varieties or races of certain species.\r\nIf such a fact could be established, it would, undoubtedly, diminish the\r\nchance of our obtaining certainty in our results; but it would by no\r\nmeans overthrow our confidence in the reality of species.\r\n\r\n_Some mere varieties possibly more distinct than certain individuals of\r\ndistinct species._--It is almost necessary, indeed, to suppose that\r\nvarieties will differ in some cases more decidedly than some species, if\r\nwe admit that there is a graduated scale of being, and assume that the\r\nfollowing laws prevail in the economy of the animate creation:--first,\r\nthat the organization of individuals is capable of being modified to a\r\nlimited extent, by the force of external causes; secondly, that these\r\nmodifications are, to a certain extent, transmissible to their\r\noffspring; thirdly, that there are fixed limits, beyond which the\r\ndescendants from common parents can never deviate from a certain type;\r\nfourthly, that each species springs from one original stock, and can\r\nnever be permanently confounded by intermixing with the progeny of any\r\nother stock; fifthly, that each species shall endure for a considerable\r\nperiod of time. Now, let us assume, for the present, these rules\r\nhypothetically, and see what consequences may naturally be expected to\r\nresult from them.\r\n\r\nWe must suppose that when the Author of Nature creates an animal or\r\nplant, all the possible circumstances in which its descendants are\r\ndestined to live are foreseen, and that an organization is conferred\r\nupon it which will enable the species to perpetuate itself and survive\r\nunder all the varying circumstances to which it must be inevitably\r\nexposed. Now, the range of variation of circumstances will differ\r\nessentially in almost every case. Let us take, for example, any one of\r\nthe most influential conditions of existence, such as temperature. In\r\nsome extensive districts near the equator, the thermometer might never\r\nvary, throughout several thousand centuries, for more than 20 degrees\r\nFahrenheit; so that if a plant or animal be provided with an\r\norganization fitting it to endure such a range, it may continue on the\r\nglobe for that immense period, although every individual might be liable\r\nat once to be cut off by the least possible excess of heat or cold\r\nbeyond the determinate degree. But if a species be placed in one of the\r\ntemperate zones, and have a constitution conferred on it capable of\r\nsupporting a similar range of temperature only, it will inevitably\r\nperish before a single year has passed away.\r\n\r\nHumboldt has shown that, at Cumana, within the tropics, there is a\r\ndifference of only 4 degrees Fahr. between the temperature of the\r\nwarmest and coldest months; whereas, in the temperate zones, the annual\r\nvariation amounts to about 60 degrees, and the extreme range of the\r\nthermometer in Canada is not less than 90 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe same remark might be applied to any other condition, as food, for\r\nexample; it may be foreseen that the supply will be regular throughout\r\nindefinite periods in one part of the world, and in another very\r\nprecarious and fluctuating both in kind and quantity. Different\r\nqualifications may be required for enabling species to live for a\r\nconsiderable time under circumstances so changeable. If, then,\r\ntemperature and food be among those external causes which, according to\r\ncertain laws of animal and vegetable physiology, modify the\r\norganization, form, or faculties, of individuals, we instantly perceive\r\nthat the degrees of variability from a common standard must differ\r\nwidely in the two cases above supposed; since there is a necessity of\r\naccommodating a species in one case to a much greater latitude of\r\ncircumstances than in the other.\r\n\r\nIf it be a law, for instance, that scanty sustenance should check those\r\nindividuals in their growth which are enabled to accommodate themselves\r\nto privations of this kind, and that a parent, prevented in this manner\r\nfrom attaining the size proper to its species, should produce a dwarfish\r\noffspring, a stunted race will arise, as is remarkably exemplified in\r\nsome varieties of the horse and dog. The difference of stature in some\r\nraces of dogs, when compared to others, is as one to five in linear\r\ndimensions, making a difference of a hundred-fold in volume.[801] Now,\r\nthere is a good reason to believe that species in general are by no\r\nmeans susceptible of existing under a diversity of circumstances, which\r\nmay give rise to such a disparity in size, and, consequently, there will\r\nbe a multitude of distinct species, of which no two adult individuals\r\ncan ever depart so widely from a certain standard of dimensions as the\r\nmere varieties of certain other species--the dog, for instance. Now, we\r\nhave only to suppose that what is true of size, may also hold in regard\r\nto color and many other attributes; and it will at once follow, that the\r\ndegree of possible discordance between varieties of the same species\r\nmay, in certain cases, exceed the utmost disparity which can arise\r\nbetween two individuals of many distinct species.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks may hold true in regard to instincts; for, if it be\r\nforeseen that one species will have to encounter a great variety of\r\nfoes, it may be necessary to arm it with great cunning and\r\ncircumspection, or with courage or other qualities capable of developing\r\nthemselves on certain occasions; such, for example, as those migratory\r\ninstincts which are so remarkably exhibited at particular periods, after\r\nthey have remained dormant for many generations. The history and habits\r\nof one variety of such a species may often differ more considerably from\r\nsome other than those of many distinct species which have no such\r\nlatitude of accommodation to circumstances.\r\n\r\n_Extent of known variability in species._--Lamarck has somewhat\r\nmis-stated the idea commonly entertained of a species; for it is not\r\ntrue that naturalists in general assume that the organisation of an\r\nanimal or plant remains absolutely constant, and that it can never vary\r\nin any of its parts.[802] All must be aware that circumstances influence\r\nthe habits, and that the habits may alter the state of the parts and\r\norgans; but the difference of opinion relates to the extent to which\r\nthese modifications of the habits and organs of a particular species may\r\nbe carried.\r\n\r\nNow, let us first inquire what positive facts can be adduced in the\r\nhistory of known species, to establish a great and permanent amount of\r\nchange in the form, structure, or instinct of individuals descending\r\nfrom some common stock. The best authenticated examples of the extent to\r\nwhich species can be made to vary may be looked for in the history of\r\ndomesticated animals and cultivated plants. It usually happens, that\r\nthose species, both of the animal and vegetable kingdom, which have the\r\ngreatest pliability of organisation, those which are most capable of\r\naccommodating themselves to a great variety of new circumstances, are\r\nmost serviceable to man. These only can be carried by him into different\r\nclimates, and can have their properties or instincts variously\r\ndiversified by differences of nourishment and habits. If the resources\r\nof a species be so limited, and its habits and faculties be of such a\r\nconfined and local character, that it can only flourish in a few\r\nparticular spots, it can rarely be of great utility.\r\n\r\nWe may consider, therefore, that in the domestication of animals and the\r\ncultivation of plants, mankind have first selected those species which\r\nhave the most flexible frames and constitutions, and have then been\r\nengaged for ages in conducting a series of experiments, with much\r\npatience and at great cost, to ascertain what may be the greatest\r\npossible deviation from a common type which can be elicited in these\r\nextreme cases.\r\n\r\n_Varieties of the dog--no transmutation._--The modifications produced in\r\nthe different races of dogs exhibit the influence of man in the most\r\nstriking point of view. These animals have been transported into every\r\nclimate and placed in every variety of circumstances; they have been\r\nmade, as a modern naturalist observes, the servant, the companion, the\r\nguardian, and the intimate friend of man, and the power of a superior\r\ngenius has had a wonderful influence not only on their forms, but on\r\ntheir manners and intelligence.[803] Different races have undergone\r\nremarkable changes in the quantity and color of their clothing; the dogs\r\nof Guinea are almost naked, while those of the arctic circle are covered\r\nwith a warm coat both of hair and wool, which enables them to bear the\r\nmost intense cold without inconvenience. There are differences also of\r\nanother kind no less remarkable, as in size, the length of their\r\nmuzzles, and the convexity of their foreheads.\r\n\r\nBut, if we look for some of those essential changes which would be\r\nrequired to lend even the semblance of a foundation for the theory of\r\nLamarck, respecting the growth of new organs and the gradual\r\nobliteration of others, we find nothing of the kind. For, in all these\r\nvarieties of the dog, says Cuvier, the relation of the bones with each\r\nother remains essentially the same; the form of the teeth never changes\r\nin any perceptible degree, except that, in some individuals, one\r\nadditional false grinder occasionally appears, sometimes on the one\r\nside, and sometimes on the other.[804] The greatest departure from a\r\ncommon type--and it constitutes the maximum of variation as yet known in\r\nthe animal kingdom--is exemplified in those races of dogs which have a\r\nsupernumerary toe on the hind foot with the corresponding tarsal bones;\r\na variety analogous to one presented by six-fingered families of the\r\nhuman race.[805]\r\n\r\nLamarck has thrown out as a conjecture, that the wolf may have been the\r\noriginal of the dog; and eminent naturalists are still divided in\r\nopinion on this subject. It seems now admitted that both species agree\r\nin the period of gestation, and Mr. Owen has been unable to confirm the\r\nalleged difference in the structure of a part of the intestinal\r\ncanal.[806] Mr. Bell inclines to the opinion that all the various races\r\nof dogs have descended from one common stock, of which the wolf is the\r\noriginal source.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the horse, the ox, the boar, and other domestic\r\nanimals which have been introduced into South America, and have run wild\r\nin many parts, have entirely lost all marks of domesticity, and have\r\nreverted to the original characters of their species. But dogs have also\r\nbecome wild in Cuba, Hayti, and in all the Caribbean islands. In the\r\ncourse of the seventeenth century, they hunted in packs from twelve to\r\nfifty, or more, in number, and fearlessly attacked herds of wild boars\r\nand other animals. It is natural, therefore, to inquire to what form\r\nthey reverted? Now, they are said by many travellers to have resembled\r\nvery nearly the shepherd's dog; but it is certain that they were never\r\nturned into wolves. They were extremely savage, and their ravages appear\r\nto have been as much dreaded as those of wolves; but when any of their\r\nwhelps were caught, and brought from the woods to the towns, they grew\r\nup in the most perfect submission to man.[807]\r\n\r\nMany examples might be adduced to prove that the extent to which the\r\nalteration of species can be pushed in the domestic state depends on the\r\noriginal capacity of the species to admit of variation. The horse has\r\nbeen as long domesticated as the dog, yet its different races depart\r\nmuch less widely from a common type; the ass has been still less\r\nchanged, the camel scarcely at all; yet these species have probably been\r\nsubjected to the influence of domestication as long as the horse.\r\n\r\n_Mummies of animals in Egyptian tombs identical with species still\r\nliving._--As the advocates of the theory of transmutation trust much to\r\nthe slow and insensible changes which time may work, they are accustomed\r\nto lament the absence of accurate descriptions, and figures of\r\nparticular animals and plants, handed down from the earliest periods of\r\nhistory, such as might have afforded data for comparing the condition of\r\nspecies, at two periods considerably remote. But, fortunately, we are in\r\nsome measure independent of such evidence: for, by a singular accident,\r\nthe priests of Egypt have bequeathed to us, in their cemeteries, that\r\ninformation which the museums and works of the Greek philosophers have\r\nfailed to transmit.\r\n\r\nFor the careful investigation of these documents, we are greatly\r\nindebted to the skill and diligence of those naturalists who accompanied\r\nthe French armies during their brief occupation of Egypt: that conquest\r\nof four years, from which we may date the improvement of the modern\r\nEgyptians in the arts and sciences, and the rapid progress which has\r\nbeen made of late in our knowledge of the arts and sciences of their\r\nremote predecessors. Instead of wasting their whole time, as so many\r\npreceding travellers had done, in exclusively collecting human mummies,\r\nM. Geoffrey and his associates examined diligently, and sent home great\r\nnumbers of embalmed bodies of consecrated animals, such as the bull, the\r\ndog, the cat, the ape, the ichneumon, the crocodile, and the ibis.\r\n\r\nTo those who have never been accustomed to connect the facts of Natural\r\nHistory with philosophical speculations, who have never raised their\r\nconceptions of the end and import of such studies beyond the mere\r\nadmiration of isolated and beautiful objects, or the exertion of skill\r\nin detecting specific differences, it will seem incredible that amidst\r\nthe din of arms, and the stirring excitement of political movements, so\r\nmuch enthusiasm could have been felt in regard to these precious\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nIn the official report drawn up by the Professors of the Museum at\r\nParis, on the value of these objects, there are some eloquent passages,\r\nwhich may appear extravagant, unless we reflect how fully these\r\nnaturalists could appreciate the bearing of the facts thus brought to\r\nlight on the past history of the globe.\r\n\r\n\"It seems,\" say they, \"as if the superstition of the ancient Egyptians\r\nhad been inspired by Nature, with a view of transmitting to after ages a\r\nmonument of her history. That extraordinary and eccentric people, by\r\nembalming with so much care the brutes which were the objects of their\r\nstupid adoration, have left us in their secret grottoes, cabinets of\r\nzoology almost complete. The climate has conspired with the art of\r\nembalming to preserve the bodies from corruption, and we can now assure\r\nourselves by our own eyes what was the state of a great number of\r\nspecies three thousand years ago. We can scarcely restrain the\r\ntransports of our imagination, on beholding thus preserved, with their\r\nminutest bones, with the smallest portions of their skin, and in every\r\nparticular most perfectly recognizable, many an animal, which at Thebes\r\nor Memphis, two or three thousand years ago, had its own priests and\r\naltars.\"[808]\r\n\r\nAmong the Egyptian mummies thus procured were not only those of numerous\r\nwild quadrupeds, birds, and reptiles; but what was perhaps of still\r\nhigher importance in deciding the great question under discussion, there\r\nwere the mummies of domestic animals, among which those above mentioned,\r\nthe bull, the dog, and the cat, were frequent. Now, such was the\r\nconformity of the whole of these species to those now living, that there\r\nwas no more difference, says Cuvier, between them than between the human\r\nmummies and the embalmed bodies of men of the present day. Yet some of\r\nthese animals have since that period been transported by man to almost\r\nevery climate, and forced to accommodate their habits to the greatest\r\nvariety of circumstances. The cat, for example, has been carried over\r\nthe whole earth, and within the last three centuries, has been\r\nnaturalized in every part of the new world,--from the cold regions of\r\nCanada to the tropical plains of Guiana; yet it has scarcely undergone\r\nany perceptible mutation, and is still the same animal which was held\r\nsacred by the Egyptians.\r\n\r\nOf the ox, undoubtedly, there are many very distinct races; but the bull\r\nApis, which was led in solemn processions by the Egyptian priests, did\r\nnot differ from some of those now living. The black cattle that have run\r\nwild in America, where there were many peculiarities in the climate not\r\nto be found, perhaps, in any part of the old world, and where scarcely a\r\nsingle plant on which they fed was of precisely the same species,\r\ninstead of altering their form and habits, have actually reverted to the\r\nexact likeness of the aboriginal wild cattle of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the arguments drawn from the Egyptian mummies, Lamarck said\r\nthey were identical with their living descendants in the same country,\r\nbecause the climate and physical geography of the banks of the Nile have\r\nremained unaltered for the last thirty centuries. But why, it may be\r\nasked, have other individuals of these species retained the same\r\ncharacters in many different quarters of the globe, where the climate\r\nand many other conditions are so varied?\r\n\r\n_Seeds and plants from the Egyptian tombs._--The evidence derived from\r\nthe Egyptian monuments was not confined to the animal kingdom; the\r\nfruits, seeds, and other portions of twenty different plants, were\r\nfaithfully preserved in the same manner; and among these the common\r\nwheat was procured by Delille, from closed vessels in the sepulchres of\r\nthe kings, the grain of which retained not only their form but even\r\ntheir color; so effectual has proved the process of embalming with\r\nbitumen in a dry and equable climate. No difference could be detected\r\nbetween this wheat and that which now grows in the East and elsewhere;\r\nand in regard to the barley, I am informed by Mr. Brown, the celebrated\r\nbotanist, that its identity with the grain of our own times can be\r\ntested by the closest comparison. On examining, for example, one of the\r\nseeds from Mr. Sam's Egyptian collection in the British Museum, it is\r\nfound that \"the structure of the husks or that part of the flower which\r\nis persistent, agrees precisely with the barley of the present day, in\r\nhaving one perfect flower and the filiform rudiments of a second.\" Some\r\nnaturalists believe that the perfect identification of the ancient\r\nEgyptian cerealia with the varieties now cultivated has been carried\r\nstill further, by sowing the seeds taken out of the catacombs, and\r\nraising plants from them; but we want more evidence of this fact.\r\nCertain it is, that when the experiment was recently made in the botanic\r\ngarden at Kew, with 100 seeds of wheat, barley, and lentils, from the\r\nEgyptian collection before mentioned of the British Museum, not one of\r\nthem would germinate.[809]\r\n\r\n_Native country of the common wheat._--And here I may observe that there\r\nis an obvious answer to Lamarck's objection, that the botanist cannot\r\npoint out a country where the common wheat grows wild, unless in places\r\nwhere it may have been derived from neighboring cultivation.[810] All\r\nnaturalists are well aware that the geographical distribution of a great\r\nnumber of species is extremely limited; that it was to be expected that\r\nevery useful plant should first be cultivated successfully in the\r\ncountry where it was indigenous; and that, probably, every station which\r\nit partially occupied, when growing wild, would be selected by the\r\nagriculturist as best suited to it when artificially increased.\r\nPalestine has been conjectured, by a late writer on the cerealia, to\r\nhave been the original habitation of wheat and barley; a supposition\r\nwhich is rendered the more plausible by Hebrew and Egyptian traditions,\r\nand by tracing the migrations of the worship of Ceres, as indicative of\r\nthe migrations of the plant.[811]\r\n\r\nIf we are to infer that some one of the wild grasses has been\r\ntransformed into the common wheat, and that some animal of the genus\r\n_Canis_, still unreclaimed, has been metamorphosed into the dog, merely\r\nbecause we cannot find the domestic dog, or the cultivated wheat, in a\r\nstate of nature, we may be next called upon to make similar admissions\r\nin regard to the camel; for it seems very doubtful whether any race of\r\nthis species of quadruped is now wild.\r\n\r\n_Changes in plants produced by cultivation._--But if agriculture, it\r\nwill be said, does not supply examples of extraordinary changes of form\r\nand organization, the horticulturist can, at least, appeal to facts\r\nwhich may confound the preceding train of reasoning. The crab has been\r\ntransformed into the apple; the sloe into the plum; flowers have changed\r\ntheir color, and become double; and these new characters can be\r\nperpetuated by seed; a bitter plant, with wavy sea-green leaves, has\r\nbeen taken from the sea-side, where it grew like wild charlock; has been\r\ntransplanted into the garden, lost its saltness, and has been\r\nmetamorphosed into two distinct vegetables, as unlike each other as is\r\neach to the parent plant--the red cabbage and the cauliflower. These,\r\nand a multitude of analogous facts, are undoubtedly among the wonders of\r\nnature, and attest more strongly, perhaps, the extent to which species\r\nmay be modified, than any examples derived from the animal kingdom. But\r\nin these cases we find that we soon reach certain limits, beyond which\r\nwe are unable to cause the individuals descending from the same stock to\r\nvary; while, on the other hand, it is easy to show that these\r\nextraordinary varieties could seldom arise, and could never be\r\nperpetuated in a wild state for many generations, under any imaginable\r\ncombination of accidents. They may be regarded as extreme cases,\r\nbrought about by human interference, and not as phenomena which indicate\r\na capability of indefinite modification in the natural world.\r\n\r\nThe propagation of a plant by buds or grafts, and by cuttings, is\r\nobviously a mode which nature does not employ; and this multiplication,\r\nas well as that produced by roots and layers, seems merely to operate as\r\nan extension of the life of an individual, and not as a reproduction of\r\nthe species such as happens by seed. All plants increased by grafts or\r\nlayers retain precisely the peculiar qualities of the individual to\r\nwhich they owe their origin, and, like an individual, they have only a\r\ndeterminate existence; in some cases longer, and in others shorter.[812]\r\nIt seems now admitted by horticulturists, that none of our garden\r\nvarieties of fruit are entitled to be considered strictly permanent, but\r\nthat they wear out after a time;[813] and we are thus compelled to\r\nresort again to seeds; in which case there is so decided a tendency in\r\nthe seedlings to revert to the original type, that our utmost skill is\r\nsometimes baffled in attempting to recover the desired variety.\r\n\r\n_Varieties of the cabbage._--The different races of cabbages afford, as\r\nwas admitted, an astonishing example of deviation from a common type;\r\nbut we can scarcely conceive them to have originated, much less to have\r\nlasted for several generations, without the intervention of man. It is\r\nonly by strong manures that these varieties have been obtained, and in\r\npoorer soils they instantly degenerate. If, therefore, we suppose in a\r\nstate of nature the seed of the wild _Brassica oleracea_ to have been\r\nwafted from the sea-side to some spot enriched by the dung of animals,\r\nand to have there become a cauliflower, it would soon diffuse its seed\r\nto some comparatively sterile soils around, and the offspring would\r\nrelapse to the likeness of the parent stock.\r\n\r\nBut if we go so far as to imagine the soil, in the spot first occupied,\r\nto be constantly manured by herds of wild animals, so as to continue as\r\nrich as that of a garden, still the variety could not be maintained;\r\nbecause we know that each of these races is prone to fecundate others,\r\nand gardeners are compelled to exert the utmost diligence to prevent\r\ncross-breeds. The intermixture of the pollen of varieties growing in the\r\npoorer soil around would soon destroy the peculiar characters of the\r\nrace which occupied the highly manured tract; for, if these accidents so\r\ncontinually happen, in spite of our care, among the culinary varieties,\r\nit is easy to see how soon this cause might obliterate every marked\r\nsingularity in a wild state.\r\n\r\nBesides, it is well known that, although the pampered races which we\r\nrear in our gardens for use or ornament may often be perpetuated by\r\nseed, yet they rarely produce seed in such abundance, or so prolific in\r\nquality, as wild individuals; so that if the care of man were withdrawn,\r\nthe most fertile variety would always, in the end, prevail over the more\r\nsterile.\r\n\r\nSimilar remarks may be applied to the double flowers, which present\r\nsuch strange anomalies to the botanist. The ovarium, in such cases, is\r\nfrequently abortive; and the seeds, when prolific, are generally much\r\nfewer than where the flowers are single.\r\n\r\n_Changes caused by soil._--Some curious experiments, recently made on\r\nthe production of blue instead of red flowers in the _Hydrangea\r\nhortensis_, illustrate the immediate effect of certain soils on the\r\ncolors of the calyx and petals. In garden-mould or compost, the flowers\r\nare invariably red; in some kinds of bog-earth they are blue; and the\r\nsame change is always produced by a particular sort of yellow loam.\r\n\r\n_Varieties of the primrose._--Linnaeus was of opinion that the primrose,\r\noxlip, cowslip, and polyanthus, were only varieties of the same species.\r\nThe majority of the modern botanists, on the contrary, consider them to\r\nbe distinct, although some conceived that the oxlip might be a cross\r\nbetween the cowslip and the primrose. Mr. Herbert has lately recorded\r\nthe following experiment:--\"I raised from the natural seed of one umbel\r\nof a highly manured red cowslip a primrose, a cowslip, oxlips of the\r\nusual and other colors, a black polyanthus, a hose-in-hose cowslip, and\r\na natural primrose bearing its flower on a polyanthus stalk. From the\r\nseed of that very hose-in-hose cowslip I have since raised a\r\nhose-in-hose primrose. I therefore consider all these to be only local\r\nvarieties, depending upon soil and situation.\"[814] Professor Henslow,\r\nof Cambridge, has since confirmed this experiment of Mr. Herbert; so\r\nthat we have an example, not only of the remarkable varieties which the\r\nflorist can obtain from a common stock, but of the distinctness of\r\nanalogous races found in a wild state.[815]\r\n\r\nOn what particular ingredient, or quality in the earth, these changes\r\ndepend, has not yet been ascertained.[816] But gardeners are well aware\r\nthat particular plants, when placed under the influence of certain\r\ncircumstances, are changed in various ways, according to the species;\r\nand as often as the experiments are repeated, similar results are\r\nobtained. The nature of these results, however, depends upon the\r\nspecies, and they are, therefore, part of the specific character; they\r\nexhibit the same phenomena, again and again, and indicate certain fixed\r\nand invariable relations between the physiological peculiarities of the\r\nplant, and the influence of certain external agents. They afford no\r\nground for questioning the instability of species, but rather the\r\ncontrary; they present us with a class of phenomena, which, when they\r\nare more thoroughly understood, may afford some of the best tests for\r\nidentifying species, and proving that the attributes originally\r\nconferred endure so long as any issue of the original stock remains upon\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nWHETHER SPECIES HAVE A REAL EXISTENCE IN NATURE--_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Limits of the variability of species--Species susceptible of\r\n    modification may be altered greatly in a short time, and in a few\r\n    generations; after which they remain stationary--The animals now\r\n    subject to man had originally an aptitude to domesticity--Acquired\r\n    peculiarities which become hereditary have a close connexion with\r\n    the habits or instincts of the species in a wild state--Some\r\n    qualities in certain animals have been conferred with a view of\r\n    their relation to man--Wild elephant domesticated in a few years,\r\n    but its faculties incapable of further development.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variability of a species compared to that of an individual._--I\r\nendeavored, in the last chapter, to show, that a belief in the reality\r\nof species is not inconsistent with the idea of a considerable degree of\r\nvariability in the specific character. This opinion, indeed, is little\r\nmore than an extension of the idea which we must entertain of the\r\nidentity of an individual, throughout the changes which it is capable of\r\nundergoing.\r\n\r\nIf a quadruped, inhabiting a cold northern latitude, and covered with a\r\nwarm coat of hair or wool, be transported to a southern climate, it will\r\noften, in the course of a few years, shed a considerable portion of its\r\ncoat, which it gradually recovers on being again restored to its native\r\ncountry. Even there the same changes are, perhaps, superinduced to a\r\ncertain extent by the return of winter and summer. We know that the\r\nAlpine hare (_Lepus variabilis_, Pal.) and the ermine, or stoat,\r\n(_Mustela erminea_, Linn.) become white during winter, and again obtain\r\ntheir full color during the warmer season; that the plumage of the\r\nptarmigan undergoes a like metamorphosis in color and quantity, and that\r\nthe change is equally temporary. We are aware that, if we reclaim some\r\nwild animal, and modify its habits and instincts by domestication, it\r\nmay, if it escapes, become in a few years nearly as wild and untractable\r\nas ever; and if the same individual be again retaken, it may be reduced\r\nto its former tame state. A plant is sown in a prepared soil, in order\r\nthat the petals of its flowers may multiply, and their color be\r\nheightened or changed: if we then withhold our care, the flowers of this\r\nsame species become again single. In these, and innumerable other\r\ninstances, we must suppose that the species was produced with a certain\r\nnumber of qualities; and, in the case of animals, with a variety of\r\ninstincts, some of which may or may not be developed according to\r\ncircumstances, or which, after having been called forth, may again\r\nbecome latent when the exciting causes are removed.\r\n\r\nNow, the formation of races seems the necessary consequence of such a\r\ncapability in species to vary, if it be a general law that the offspring\r\nshould very closely resemble the parent. But, before we can infer that\r\nthere are no limits to the deviation from an original type which may be\r\nbrought about in the course of an indefinite number of generations, we\r\nought to have some proof that, in each successive generation,\r\nindividuals may go on acquiring an equal amount of new peculiarities,\r\nunder the influence of equal changes of circumstances. The balance of\r\nevidence, however, inclines most decidedly on the opposite side; for in\r\nall cases we find that the quantity of divergence diminishes after a few\r\ngenerations in a very rapid ratio.\r\n\r\n_Species susceptible of modification may be greatly altered in a few\r\ngenerations._--It cannot be objected, that it is out of our power to go\r\non varying the circumstances in the same manner as might happen in the\r\nnatural course of events during some great geological cycle. For in the\r\nfirst place, where a capacity is given to individuals to adapt\r\nthemselves to new circumstances, it does not generally require a very\r\nlong period for its development: if, indeed, such were the case, it is\r\nnot easy to see how the modification would answer the ends proposed, for\r\nall the individuals would die before new qualities, habits, or instincts\r\nwere conferred.\r\n\r\nWhen we have succeeded in naturalizing some tropical plant in a\r\ntemperate climate, nothing prevents us from attempting gradually to\r\nextend its distribution to higher latitudes, or to greater elevations\r\nabove the level of the sea, allowing equal quantities of time, or an\r\nequal number of generations, for habituating the species to successive\r\nincrements of cold. But every husbandman and gardener is aware that such\r\nexperiments will fail; and we are more likely to succeed in making some\r\nplants, in the course of the first two generations, support a\r\nconsiderable degree of difference of temperature, than a very small\r\ndifference afterwards, though we persevere for many centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is the same if we take any other cause instead of temperature; such\r\nas the quality of the food, or the kind of dangers to which an animal is\r\nexposed, or the soil in which a plant lives. The alteration in habits,\r\nform, or organization, is often rapid during a short period; but when\r\nthe circumstances are made to vary farther, though in ever so slight a\r\ndegree, all modification ceases, and the individual perishes. Thus some\r\nherbivorous quadrupeds may be made to feed partially on fish or flesh;\r\nbut even these can never be taught to live on some herbs which they\r\nreject, and which would even poison them, although the same may be very\r\nnutritious to other species of the same natural order. So when man uses\r\nforce or stratagem against wild animals, the persecuted race soon\r\nbecomes more cautious, watchful, and cunning; new instincts seem often\r\nto be developed, and to become hereditary in the first two or three\r\ngenerations: but let the skill and address of man increase, however\r\ngradually, no farther variation can take place, no new qualities are\r\nelicited by the increasing dangers. The alteration of the habits of the\r\nspecies has reached a point beyond which no ulterior modification is\r\npossible, however indefinite the lapse of ages during which the new\r\ncircumstances operate. Extirpation then follows, rather than such a\r\ntransformation as could alone enable the species to perpetuate itself\r\nunder the new state of things.\r\n\r\n_Animals now subject to man had originally an aptitude to\r\ndomesticity._--It has been well observed by M. F. Cuvier and M. Dureau\r\nde la Malle, that unless some animals had manifested in a wild state an\r\naptitude to second the efforts of man, their domestication would never\r\nhave been attempted. If they had all resembled the wolf, the fox, and\r\nthe hyaena, the patience of the experimentalist would have been exhausted\r\nby innumerable failures before he at last succeeded in obtaining some\r\nimperfect results; so if the first advantages derived from the\r\ncultivation of plants had been elicited by as tedious and costly a\r\nprocess as that by which we now make some slight additional improvements\r\nin certain races, we should have remained to this day in ignorance of\r\nthe greater number of their useful qualities.\r\n\r\n_Acquired instincts of some animals become hereditary._--It is\r\nundoubtedly true, that many new habits and qualities have not only been\r\nacquired in recent times by certain races of dogs, but have been\r\ntransmitted to their offspring. But in these cases it will be observed,\r\nthat the new peculiarities have an intimate relation to the habits of\r\nthe animal in a wild state, and therefore do not attest any tendency to\r\na departure to an indefinite extent from the original type of the\r\nspecies. A race of dogs employed for hunting deer in the platform of\r\nSante Fa, in Mexico, affords a beautiful illustration of a new\r\nhereditary instinct. The mode of attack, observes M. Roulin, which they\r\nemploy consists in seizing the animal by the belly and overturning it by\r\na sudden effort, taking advantage of the moment when the body of the\r\ndeer rests only upon the fore-legs. The weight of the animal thus thrown\r\nover is often six times that of its antagonist. The dog of pure breed\r\ninherits a disposition to this kind of chase, and never attacks a deer\r\nfrom before while running. Even should the deer, not perceiving him,\r\ncome directly upon him, the dog steps aside and makes his assault on the\r\nflank; whereas other hunting dogs, though of superior strength, and\r\ngeneral sagacity, which are brought from Europe, are destitute of this\r\ninstinct. For want of similar precautions, they are often killed by the\r\ndeer on the spot, the vertebrae of their neck being dislocated by the\r\nviolence of the shock.[817]\r\n\r\nA new instinct has also become hereditary in a mongrel race of dogs\r\nemployed by the inhabitants of the banks of the Magdalena almost\r\nexclusively in hunting the white-lipped pecari. The address of these\r\ndogs consists in restraining their ardor, and attaching themselves to no\r\nanimal in particular, but keeping the whole herd in check. Now, among\r\nthese dogs some are found, which the very first time they are taken to\r\nthe woods, are acquainted with this mode of attack; whereas, a dog of\r\nanother breed starts forward at once, is surrounded by the pecari, and,\r\nwhatever may be his strength, is destroyed in a moment.\r\n\r\nSome of our countrymen, engaged of late in conducting one of the\r\nprincipal mining associations in Mexico, that of Real del Monte, carried\r\nout with them some English greyhounds of the best breed, to hunt the\r\nhares which abound in that country. The great platform which is the\r\nscene of sport is at an elevation of about nine thousand feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, and the mercury in the barometer stands habitually at\r\nthe height of about nineteen inches. It was found that the greyhounds\r\ncould not support the fatigues of a long chase in this attenuated\r\natmosphere, and before they could come up with their prey, they lay down\r\ngasping for breath; but these same animals have produced whelps which\r\nhave grown up, and are not in the least degree incommoded by the want of\r\ndensity in the air, but run down the hares with as much ease as the\r\nfleetest of their race in this country.\r\n\r\nThe fixed and deliberate stand of the pointer has with propriety been\r\nregarded as a mere modification of a habit, which may have been useful\r\nto a wild race accustomed to wind game, and steal upon it by surprise,\r\nfirst pausing for an instant, in order to spring with unerring aim. The\r\nfaculty of the retriever, however, may justly be regarded as more\r\ninexplicable and less easily referable to the instinctive passions of\r\nthe species. M. Majendie, says a French writer in a recently published\r\nmemoir, having learnt that there was a race of dogs in England which\r\nstopped and brought back game of their own accord, procured a pair, and\r\nhaving obtained a whelp from them, kept it constantly under his eyes,\r\nuntil he had an opportunity of assuring himself that, without having\r\nreceived any instruction, and on the very first day that it was carried\r\nto the chase, it brought back game with as much steadiness as dogs which\r\nhad been schooled into the same manoeuvre by means of the whip and\r\ncollar.\r\n\r\n_Attributes of animals in their relation to man._--Such attainments, as\r\nwell as the habits and dispositions which the shepherd's dog and many\r\nothers inherit, seem to be of a nature and extent which we can hardly\r\nexplain by supposing them to be modifications of instincts necessary for\r\nthe preservation of the species in a wild state. When such remarkable\r\nhabits appear in races of this species we may reasonably conjecture that\r\nthey were given with no other view than for the use of man and the\r\npreservation of the dog, which thus obtains protection.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, I fully agree with M. F. Cuvier, that, in studying\r\nthe habits of animals, we must attempt, as far as possible, to refer\r\ntheir domestic qualities to modifications of instincts which are\r\nimplanted in them in a state of nature; and that writer has successfully\r\npointed out, in an admirable essay on the domestication of the\r\nmammalia[818], the true origin of many dispositions which are vulgarly\r\nattributed to the influence of education alone. But we should go too far\r\nif we did not admit that some of the qualities of particular animals and\r\nplants may have been given solely with a view to the connection which it\r\nwas foreseen would exist between them and man--especially when we see\r\nthat connexion to be in many cases so intimate, that the greater number,\r\nand sometimes, as in the case of the camel, all the individuals of the\r\nspecies which exist on the earth are in subjection to the human race.\r\n\r\nWe can perceive in a multitude of animals, especially in some of the\r\nparasitic tribes, that certain instincts and organs are conferred for\r\nthe purpose of defence or attack against some other species. Now if we\r\nare reluctant to suppose the existence of similar relations between man\r\nand the instincts of many of the inferior animals, we adopt an\r\nhypothesis no less violent, though in the opposite extreme to that which\r\nhas led some to imagine the whole animate and inanimate creation to have\r\nbeen made solely for the support, gratification, and instruction of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nMany species, most hostile to our persons or property, multiply, in\r\nspite of our efforts to repress them; others, on the contrary, are\r\nintentionally augmented many hundred fold in number by our exertions. In\r\nsuch instances, we must imagine the relative resources of man, and of\r\nspecies friendly or inimical to him, to have been prospectively\r\ncalculated and adjusted. To withhold assent to this supposition, would\r\nbe to refuse what we must grant in respect to the economy of nature in\r\nevery other part of the organic creation; for the various species of\r\ncontemporary plants and animals have obviously their relative forces,\r\nnicely balanced, and their respective tastes, passions, and instincts so\r\ncontrived, that they are all in perfect harmony with each other. In no\r\nother manner could it happen that each species, surrounded, as it is, by\r\ncountless dangers, should be enabled to maintain its ground for periods\r\nof considerable duration.\r\n\r\nThe docility of the individuals of some of our domestic species,\r\nextending, as it does, to attainments foreign to their natural habits\r\nand faculties, may, perhaps, have been conferred with a view to their\r\nassociation with man. But, lest species should be thereby made to vary\r\nindefinitely, we find that such habits are never transmissible by\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nA pig has been trained to hunt and point game with great activity and\r\nsteadiness[819]; and other learned individuals, of the same species,\r\nhave been taught to spell; but such fortuitous acquirements never become\r\nhereditary, for they have no relation whatever to the exigencies of the\r\nanimal in a wild state, and cannot, therefore, be developments of any\r\ninstinctive propensities.\r\n\r\n_Influence of domestication._--An animal in domesticity, says M. F.\r\nCuvier, is not essentially in a different situation, in regard to the\r\nfeeling of restraint, from one left to itself. It lives in society\r\nwithout constraint, because, without doubt, it was a social animal; and\r\nit conforms itself to the will of man, because it had a chief, to which,\r\nin a wild state, it would have yielded obedience. There is nothing in\r\nits new situation that is not conformable to its propensities; it is\r\nsatisfying its wants by submission to a master, and makes no sacrifice\r\nof its natural inclinations. All the social animals, when left to\r\nthemselves, form herds more or less numerous; and all the individuals of\r\nthe same herd know each other, are mutually attached, and will not allow\r\na strange individual to join them. In a wild state, moreover, they obey\r\nsome individual, which, by its superiority, has become the chief of the\r\nherd. Our domestic species had, originally, this sociability of\r\ndisposition; and no solitary species, however easy it may be _to tame\r\nit_, has yet afforded true domestic races. We merely, therefore,\r\ndevelope, to our own advantage, propensities which propel the\r\nindividuals of certain species to draw near to their fellows.\r\n\r\nThe sheep which we have reared is induced to follow us, as it would be\r\nled to follow the flock among which it was brought up; and, when\r\nindividuals of gregarious species have been accustomed to one master, it\r\nis he alone whom they acknowledge as their chief--he only whom they\r\nobey. \"The elephant allows himself to be directed only by the carnac\r\nwhom he has adopted; the dog itself, reared in solitude with its master,\r\nmanifests a hostile disposition towards all others; and every body knows\r\nhow dangerous it is to be in the midst of a herd of cows, in pasturages\r\nthat are little frequented, when they have not at their head the keeper\r\nwho takes care of them.\r\n\r\n\"Every thing, therefore, tends to convince us, that formerly men were\r\nonly with regard to the domestic animals, what those who are\r\nparticularly charged with the care of them still are--namely, members of\r\nthe society which these animals form among themselves; and, that they\r\nare only distinguished, in the general mass, by the authority which they\r\nhave been enabled to assume from their superiority of intellect. Thus,\r\nevery social animal which recognizes man as a member, and as the chief\r\nof its herd, is a domestic animal. It might even be said, that, from the\r\nmoment when such an animal admits man as a member of its society, it is\r\ndomesticated, as man could not enter into such society without becoming\r\nthe chief of it.\"[820]\r\n\r\nBut the ingenious author whose observations I have here cited, admits\r\nthat the obedience which the individuals of many domestic species yield\r\nindifferently to every person, is without analogy in any state of things\r\nwhich could exist previously to their subjugation by man. Each troop of\r\nwild horses, it is true, has some stallion for its chief, who draws\r\nafter him all the individuals of which the herd is composed; but when a\r\ndomesticated horse has passed from hand to hand, and has served several\r\nmasters, he becomes equally docile towards _any person_, and is\r\nsubjected to the whole human race. It seems fair to presume that the\r\ncapability in the instinct of the horse to be thus modified, was given\r\nto enable the species to render greater services to man; and, perhaps,\r\nthe facility with which many other acquired characters become hereditary\r\nin various races of the horse, may be explicable only on a like\r\nsupposition. The amble, for example, a pace to which the domestic races\r\nin some parts of Spanish America are exclusively trained, has, in the\r\ncourse of several generations, become hereditary, and is assumed by all\r\nthe young colts before they are broken in.[821]\r\n\r\nIt seems, also, reasonable to conclude, that the power bestowed on the\r\nhorse, the dog, the ox, the sheep, the cat, and many species of domestic\r\nfowls, of supporting almost every climate, was given expressly to enable\r\nthem to follow man throughout all parts of the globe, in order that we\r\nmight obtain their services, and they our protection. If it be objected\r\nthat the elephant which, by the union of strength, intelligence, and\r\ndocility, can render the greatest services to mankind, is incapable of\r\nliving in any but the warmest latitudes, we may observe that the\r\nquantity of vegetable food required by this quadruped would render its\r\nmaintenance in the temperate zones too costly, and in the arctic\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nAmong the changes superinduced by man, none appear, at first sight, more\r\nremarkable than the perfect tameness of certain domestic races. It is\r\nwell known that, at however early an age we obtain possession of the\r\nyoung of many unreclaimed races, they will retain, throughout life, a\r\nconsiderable timidity and apprehensiveness of danger; whereas, after one\r\nor two generations, the descendants of the same stock will habitually\r\nplace the most implicit confidence in man. There is good reason,\r\nhowever, to suspect that such changes are not without analogy in a state\r\nof nature; or, to speak more correctly, in situations where man has not\r\ninterfered.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Mr. Darwin, that in the Galapagos archipelago, placed\r\ndirectly under the equator, and nearly 600 miles west of the American\r\ncontinent, all the terrestrial birds, as the finches, doves, hawks, and\r\nothers, are so tame, that they may be killed with a switch. One day,\r\nsays this author, \"a mocking bird alighted on the edge of a pitcher\r\nwhich I held in my hand, and began quietly to sip the water, and allowed\r\nme to lift it with the vessel from the ground.\" Yet formerly, when the\r\nfirst Europeans landed, and found no inhabitants in these islands, the\r\nbirds were even tamer than now: already they are beginning to acquire\r\nthat salutary dread of man which in countries long settled is natural\r\neven to young birds which have never received any injury. So in the\r\nFalkland Islands, both the birds and foxes are entirely without fear of\r\nman; whereas, in the adjoining mainland of South America, many of the\r\nsame species of birds are extremely wild; for there they have for ages\r\nbeen persecuted by the natives.[822]\r\n\r\nDr. Richardson informs us, in his able history of the habits of the\r\nNorth American animals, that, \"in the retired parts of the mountains\r\nwhere the hunters had seldom penetrated, there is no difficulty in\r\napproaching the Rocky Mountain sheep, which there exhibit _the\r\nsimplicity of character so remarkable in the domestic species_; but\r\nwhere they have been often fired at, they are exceedingly wild, alarm\r\ntheir companions, on the approach of danger, by a hissing noise, and\r\nscale the rocks with a speed and agility that baffle pursuit.\"[823]\r\n\r\nIt is probable, therefore, that as man, in diffusing himself over the\r\nglobe, has tamed many wild races, so, also, he has made many tame races\r\nwild. Had some of the larger carnivorous beasts, capable of scaling the\r\nrocks, made their way into the North American mountains before our\r\nhunters, a similar alteration in the instincts of the sheep would\r\ndoubtless have been brought about.\r\n\r\n_Wild elephants domesticated in a few years._--No animal affords a more\r\nstriking illustration of the principal points which I have been\r\nendeavouring to establish than the elephant; for, in the first place,\r\nthe wonderful sagacity with which he accommodates himself to the society\r\nof man, and the new habits which he contracts, are not the result of\r\ntime, nor of modifications produced in the course of many generations.\r\nThese animals will breed in captivity, as is now ascertained, in\r\nopposition to the vulgar opinion of many modern naturalists, and in\r\nconformity to that of the ancients AElian and Columella[824]: yet it has\r\nalways been the custom, as the least expensive mode of obtaining them,\r\nto capture wild individuals in the forests, usually when full grown;\r\nand, in a few years after they are taken--sometimes, it is said, in the\r\nspace of a few months--their education is completed.\r\n\r\nHad the whole species been domesticated from an early period in the\r\nhistory of man, like the camel, their superior intelligence would,\r\ndoubtless, have been attributed to their long and familiar intercourse\r\nwith the lord of the creation; but we know that a few years is\r\nsufficient to bring about this wonderful change of habits; and although\r\nthe same individual may continue to receive tuition for a century\r\nafterwards, yet it makes no farther progress in the general development\r\nof its faculties. Were it otherwise, indeed, the animal would soon\r\ndeserve more than the poet's epithet of \"half-reasoning.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the authority of our countrymen employed in the late Burmese war,\r\nit appears, in corroboration of older accounts, that when elephants are\r\nrequired to execute extraordinary tasks, they may be made to understand\r\nthat they will receive unusual rewards. Some favourite dainty is shown\r\nto them, in the hope of acquiring which the work is done; and so\r\nperfectly does the nature of the contract appear to be understood, that\r\nthe breach of it, on the part of the master, is often attended with\r\ndanger. In this case, a power has been given to the species to adapt\r\ntheir social instincts to new circumstances with surprising rapidity;\r\nbut the extent of this change is defined by strict and arbitrary limits.\r\nThere is no indication of a tendency to continued divergence from\r\ncertain attributes with which the elephant was originally endued--no\r\nground whatever for anticipating that, in thousands of centuries, any\r\nmaterial alteration could ever be effected. All that we can infer from\r\nanalogy is, that some more useful and peculiar races might probably be\r\nformed, if the experiment were fairly tried; and that some individual\r\ncharacteristic, now only casual and temporary, might be perpetuated by\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, therefore, where the domestic qualities exist in animals,\r\nthey seem to require no lengthened process for their developement; and\r\nthey appear to have been wholly denied to some classes, which, from\r\ntheir strength and social disposition, might have rendered great\r\nservices to man; as, for example, the greater part of the quadrumana.\r\nThe orang-outang, indeed, which, for its resemblance in form to man, and\r\napparently for no other good reason, has been assumed by Lamarck to be\r\nthe most perfect of the inferior animals, has been tamed by the savages\r\nof Borneo, and made to climb lofty trees, and to bring down the fruit.\r\nBut he is said to yield to his masters an unwilling obedience, and to be\r\nheld in subjection only by severe discipline. We know nothing of the\r\nfaculties of this animal which can suggest the idea that it rivals the\r\nelephant in intelligence; much less anything which can countenance the\r\ndreams of those who have fancied that it might have been transmuted into\r\nthe \"dominant race.\" One of the baboons of Sumatra (_Simia carpolegus_)\r\nappears to be more docile, and is frequently trained by the inhabitants\r\nto ascend trees, for the purpose of gathering cocoa-nuts; a service in\r\nwhich the animal is very expert. He selects, says Sir Stamford Raffles,\r\nthe ripe nuts, with great judgment, and pulls no more than he is\r\nordered.[825] The capuchin and cacajao monkeys are, according to\r\nHumboldt, taught to ascend trees in the same manner, and to throw down\r\nfruit on the banks of the lower Orinoco.[826]\r\n\r\nIt is for the Lamarckians to explain how it happens that those same\r\nsavages of Borneo have not themselves acquired, by dint of longing, for\r\nmany generations, for the power of climbing trees, the elongated arms of\r\nthe ourang, or even the prehensile tails of some American monkeys:\r\nInstead of being reduced to the necessity of subjugating stubborn and\r\nuntractable brutes, we should naturally have anticipated \"that their\r\nwants would have excited them to efforts, and that continued efforts\r\nwould have given rise to new organs;\" or rather to the re-acquisition of\r\norgans which, in a manner irreconcileable with the principle of the\r\n_progressive_ system, have grown obsolete in tribes of men which have\r\nsuch constant need of them.\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation._--It follows, then, from the different facts which have\r\nbeen considered in this chapter, that a short period of time is\r\ngenerally sufficient to effect nearly the whole change which an\r\nalteration of external circumstances can bring about in the habits of a\r\nspecies, and that such capacity of accommodation to new circumstances is\r\nenjoyed in very different degrees, by different species.\r\n\r\nCertain qualities appear to be bestowed exclusively with a view to the\r\nrelations which are destined to exist between different species, and,\r\namong others, between certain species and man; but these latter are\r\nalways so nearly connected with the original habits and propensities of\r\neach species in a wild state, that they imply no indefinite capacity of\r\nvarying from the original type. The acquired habits derived from human\r\ntuition are rarely transmitted to the offspring; and when this happens,\r\nit is almost universally the case with those merely which have some\r\nobvious connexion with the attributes of the species when in a state of\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nWHETHER SPECIES HAVE A REAL EXISTENCE IN NATURE--_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Phenomena of hybrids--Hunter's opinions--Mules not strictly\r\n    intermediate between parent species--Hybrid plants--Experiments of\r\n    Kolreuter and Wiegmann--Vegetable hybrids prolific throughout\r\n    several generations--Why rare in a wild state--Decundolle on hybrid\r\n    plants--The phenomena of hybrids confirm the distinctness of\r\n    species--Theory of the gradation in the intelligence of animals as\r\n    indicated by the facial angle--Doctrine that certain organs of the\r\n    foetus in mammalia assume successively the forms of fish, reptile,\r\n    and bird--Recapitulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Phenomena of hybrids._--We have yet to consider another class of\r\nphenomena, those relating to the production of hybrids, which have been\r\nregarded in a very different light with reference to their bearing on\r\nthe question of the permanent distinctness of species; some naturalists\r\nconsidering them as affording the strongest of all proofs in favor of\r\nthe reality of species; others, on the contrary, appealing to them as\r\ncountenancing the opposite doctrine, that all the varieties of\r\norganization and instinct now exhibited in the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdoms may have been propagated from a small number of original types.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the mammifers and birds it is found that no sexual union\r\nwill take place between races which are remote from each other in their\r\nhabits and organization; and it is only in species that are very nearly\r\nallied that such unions produce offspring. It may be laid down as a\r\ngeneral rule, admitting of very few exceptions among quadrupeds, that\r\nthe hybrid progeny is sterile; and there seem to be no well\r\nauthenticated examples of the continuance of the mule race beyond one\r\ngeneration. The principal number of observations and experiments relate\r\nto the mixed offspring of the horse and the ass; and in this case it is\r\nwell established that the he-mule can generate, and the she-mule\r\nproduce. Such cases occur in Spain and Italy, and much more frequently\r\nin the West Indies and New Holland; but these mules have never bred in\r\ncold climates, seldom in warm regions, and still more rarely in\r\ntemperate countries.\r\n\r\nThe hybrid offspring of the she-ass and the stallion, the [Greek:\r\nginnos] of Aristotle, and the hinnus of Pliny, differs from the mule, or\r\nthe offspring of the ass and mare. In both cases, says Buffon, these\r\nanimals retain more of the dam than of the sire, not only in the\r\nmagnitude, but in the figure of the body: whereas, in the form of the\r\nhead, limbs, and tail, they bear a greater resemblance to the sire. The\r\nsame naturalist infers, from various experiments respecting cross-breeds\r\nbetween the he-goat and ewe, the dog and she-wolf, the goldfinch and\r\ncanary-bird, that the male transmits his sex to the greatest number, and\r\nthat the preponderance of males over females exceeds that which prevails\r\nwhere the parents are of the same species.\r\n\r\n_Hunter's opinion._--The celebrated John Hunter has observed, that the\r\ntrue distinction of species must ultimately be gathered from their\r\nincapacity of propagating with each other, and producing offspring\r\ncapable of again continuing itself. He was unwilling, however, to admit\r\nthat the horse and the ass were of the same species, because some rare\r\ninstances had been adduced of the breeding of mules, although he\r\nmaintained that the wolf, the dog, and the jackal were all of one\r\nspecies; because he had found, by two experiments, that the dog would\r\nbreed both with the wolf and the jackal; and that the mule, in each\r\ncase, would breed again with the dog. In these cases, however, it may be\r\nobserved, that there was always one parent at least of pure breed, and\r\nno proof was obtained that a true hybrid race could be perpetuated; a\r\nfact of which I believe no examples are yet recorded, either in regard\r\nto mixtures of the horse and ass, or any other of the mammalia.\r\n\r\nShould the fact be hereafter ascertained, that two mules can propagate\r\ntheir kind, we must still inquire whether the offspring may not be\r\nregarded in the light of a monstrous birth, proceeding from some\r\naccidental cause, or, rather, to speak more philosophically, from some\r\ngeneral law not yet understood, but which may not be permitted\r\npermanently to interfere with those laws of generation by which species\r\nmay, in general, be prevented from becoming blended. If, for example, we\r\ndiscovered that the progeny of a mule race degenerated greatly, in the\r\nfirst generation, in force, sagacity, or any attribute necessary for its\r\npreservation in a state of nature, we might infer that, like a monster,\r\nit is a mere temporary and fortuitous variety. Nor does it seem probable\r\nthat the greater number of such monsters could ever occur unless\r\nobtained by art; for, in Hunter's experiments, stratagem or force was,\r\nin most instances, employed to bring about the irregular connexion.[827]\r\n\r\n_Mules not strictly intermediate between the parent species._--It seems\r\nrarely to happen that the mule offspring is truly intermediate in\r\ncharacter between the two parents. Thus Hunter mentions that, in his\r\nexperiments, one of the hybrid pups resembled the wolf much more than\r\nthe rest of the litter; and we are informed by Wiegmann, that, in a\r\nlitter lately obtained in the Royal Menagerie at Berlin, from a white\r\npointer and a she-wolf, two of the cubs resembled the common wolf-dog,\r\nbut the third was like a pointer with hanging ears.\r\n\r\nThere is undoubtedly a very close analogy between these phenomena and\r\nthose presented by the intermixture of distinct races of the same\r\nspecies, both in the inferior animals and in man. Dr. Prichard, in his\r\n\"Physical History of Mankind,\" cites examples where the peculiarities of\r\nthe parents have been transmitted very unequally to the offspring; as\r\nwhere children, entirely white, or perfectly black, have sprung from the\r\nunion of the European and the negro. Sometimes the colour or other\r\npeculiarities of one parent, after having failed to show themselves in\r\nthe immediate progeny, reappear in a subsequent generation; as where a\r\nwhite child is born of two black parents, the grandfather having been a\r\nwhite.[828]\r\n\r\nThe same author judiciously observes that, if different species mixed\r\ntheir breed, and hybrid races were often propagated, the animal world\r\nwould soon present a scene of confusion; its tribes would be every where\r\nblended together, and we should perhaps find more hybrid creatures than\r\ngenuine and uncorrupted races.[829]\r\n\r\n_Hybrid plants._--_Kolreuter's experiments_.--The history of the\r\nvegetable kingdom has been thought to afford more decisive evidence in\r\nfavour of the theory of the formation of new and permanent species from\r\nhybrid stocks. The first accurate experiments in illustration of this\r\ncurious subject appear to have been made by Kolreuter, who obtained a\r\nhybrid from two species of tobacco, _Nicotiana rustica_ and _N.\r\npaniculata_, which differ greatly in the shape of their leaves, the\r\ncolour of the corolla, and the height of the stem. The stigma of a plant\r\nof _N. rustica_ was impregnated with the pollen of a plant of _N.\r\npaniculata_. The seed ripened, and produced a hybrid which was\r\nintermediate between the two parents, and which, like all the hybrids\r\nwhich this botanist brought up, had imperfect stamens. He afterwards\r\nimpregnated this hybrid with the pollen of _N. paniculata_, and obtained\r\nplants which much more resembled the last. This he continued through\r\nseveral generations, until, by due perseverance, he actually changed the\r\n_Nicotiana rustica_ into the _Nicotiana paniculata_.\r\n\r\nThe plan of impregnation adopted, was the cutting off of the anthers of\r\nthe plant intended for fructification before they had shed pollen, and\r\nthen laying on foreign pollen upon the stigma.\r\n\r\n_Wiegmann's experiments._--The same experiment has since been repeated\r\nwith success by Wiegmann, who found that he could bring back the hybrids\r\nto the exact likeness of either parent, by crossing them a sufficient\r\nnumber of times.\r\n\r\nThe blending of the characters of the parent stocks, in many other of\r\nWiegmann's experiments, was complete; the colour and shape of the leaves\r\nand flowers, and even the scent, being intermediate, as in the offspring\r\nof the two species of verbascum. An intermarriage, also, between the\r\ncommon onion and the leek (_Allium cepa_ and _A. porrum_) gave a mule\r\nplant, which, in the character of its leaves and flowers, approached\r\nmost nearly to the garden onion, but had the elongated bulbous root and\r\nsmell of the leek.\r\n\r\nThe same botanist remarks, that vegetable hybrids, when not strictly\r\nintermediate, more frequently approach the female than the male parent\r\nspecies; _but they never exhibit characters foreign to both_. A re-cross\r\nwith one of the original stocks generally causes the mule plant to\r\nrevert towards that stock; but this is not always the case, the\r\noffspring sometimes continuing to exhibit the character of a full\r\nhybrid.\r\n\r\nIn general, the success attending the production and perpetuity of\r\nhybrids among plants depends, as in the animal kingdom, on the degree of\r\nproximity between the species intermarried. If their organization be\r\nvery remote, impregnation never takes place; if somewhat less distant,\r\nseeds are formed, but always imperfect and sterile. The next degree of\r\nrelationship yields hybrid seedlings, but these are barren; and it is\r\nonly when the parent species are very nearly allied that the hybrid race\r\nmay be perpetuated for several generations. Even in this case the best\r\nauthenticated examples seem confined to the crossing of hybrids with\r\nindividuals of pure breed. In none of the experiments most accurately\r\ndetailed does it appear that both the parents were mules.\r\n\r\nWiegmann diversified as much as possible his mode of bringing about\r\nthese irregular unions among plants. He often sowed parallel rows, near\r\nto each other, of the species from which he desired to breed; and,\r\ninstead of mutilating, after Kolreuter's fashion, the plants of one of\r\nthe parent stocks, he merely washed the pollen off their anthers. The\r\nbranches of the plants in each row were then gently bent towards each\r\nother and intertwined; so that the wind, and numerous insects, as they\r\npassed from the flowers of one to those of the other species, carried\r\nthe pollen and produced fecundation.\r\n\r\n_Vegetable hybrids why rare in a wild slate._--The same observer saw a\r\ngood exemplification of the manner in which hybrids may be formed in a\r\nstate of nature. Some wallflowers and pinks had been growing in a\r\ngarden, in a dry sunny situation, and their stigmas had been ripened so\r\nas to be moist, and to absorb pollen with avidity, although their\r\nanthers were not yet developed. These stigmas became impregnated by\r\npollen blown from some other adjacent plants of the same species; but\r\nhad they been of different species, and not too remote in their\r\norganization, mule races must have resulted.\r\n\r\nWhen, indeed, we consider how busily some insects have been shown to be\r\nengaged in conveying anther-dust from flower to flower, especially bees,\r\nflower-eating beetles, and the like, it seems a most enigmatical problem\r\nhow it can happen that promiscuous alliances between distinct species\r\nare not perpetually occurring.\r\n\r\nHow continually do we observe the bees diligently employed in collecting\r\nthe red and yellow powder by which the stamens of flowers are covered,\r\nloading it on their hind legs, and carrying it to their hive for the\r\npurpose of feeding their young! In thus providing for their own progeny,\r\nthese insects assist materially the process of fructification.[830] Few\r\npersons need be reminded that the stamens in certain plants grow on\r\ndifferent blossoms from the pistils; and unless the summit of the pistil\r\nbe touched with the fertilizing dust, the fruit does not swell, nor the\r\nseed arrive at maturity. It is by the help of bees chiefly, that the\r\ndevelopment of the fruit of many such species is secured, the powder\r\nwhich they have collected from the stamens being unconsciously left by\r\nthem in visiting the pistils.\r\n\r\nHow often, during the heat of a summer's day, do we see the males of\r\ndioecious plants, such as the yew-tree, standing separate from the\r\nfemales, and sending off into the air, upon the slightest breath of\r\nwind, clouds of buoyant pollen! That the zephyr should so rarely\r\nintervene to fecundate the plants of one species with the anther-dust of\r\nothers, seems almost to realize the converse of the miracle believed by\r\nthe credulous herdsmen of the Lusitanian mares--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ore omnes versae in Zephyrum, stant rupibus altis\r\n  Exceptantque leves auras: et saepe sine ullis\r\n  Conjugiis, vento gravidae, mirabile dictu.[831]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, in the first place, it appears that there is a natural aversion in\r\nplants, as well as in animals, to irregular sexual unions; and in most\r\nof the successful experiments in the animal and vegetable world, some\r\nviolence has been used in order to procure impregnation. The stigma\r\nimbibes, slowly and reluctantly, the granules of the pollen of another\r\nspecies, even when it is abundantly covered with it; and if it happen\r\nthat, during this period, ever so slight a quantity of the anther-dust\r\nof its own species alight upon it, this is instantly absorbed, and the\r\neffect of the foreign pollen destroyed. Besides, it does not often\r\nhappen that the male and female organs of fructification, in different\r\nspecies, arrive at a state of maturity at precisely the same time. Even\r\nwhere such synchronism does prevail, so that a cross impregnation is\r\neffected, the chances are very numerous against the establishment of a\r\nhybrid race.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the vegetable kingdom generally, it must be recollected\r\nthat even of the seeds which are well ripened, a great part are either\r\neaten by insects, birds, and other animals, or decay for want of room\r\nand opportunity to germinate. Unhealthy plants are the first which are\r\ncut off by causes prejudicial to the species, being usually stifled by\r\nmore vigorous individuals of their own kind. If, therefore, the relative\r\nfecundity or hardiness of hybrids be in the least degree inferior, they\r\ncannot maintain their footing for many generations, even if they were\r\never produced beyond one generation in a wild state. In the universal\r\nstruggle for existence, the right of the strongest eventually prevails;\r\nand the strength and durability of a race depend mainly on its\r\nprolificness, in which hybrids are acknowledged to be deficient.\r\n\r\n_Centaurea hybrida_, a plant which never bears seed, and is supposed to\r\nbe produced by the frequent intermixture of two well-known species of\r\nCentaurea, grows wild upon a hill near Turin. _Ranunculus lacerus_, also\r\nsterile, has been produced accidentally at Grenoble, and near Paris, by\r\nthe union of two Ranunculi; but this occurred in gardens.[832]\r\n\r\n_Mr. Herbert's experiments._--Mr. Herbert, in one of his ingenious\r\npapers on mule plants, endeavors to account for their non-occurrence in\r\na state of nature, from the circumstance that all the combinations that\r\nwere likely to occur have already been made many centuries ago, and have\r\nformed the various species of botanists; but in our gardens, he says,\r\nwhenever species, having a certain degree of affinity to each other, are\r\ntransported from different countries, and brought for the first time\r\ninto contact, they give rise to hybrid species.[833] But we have no\r\ndata, as yet, to warrant the conclusion, that a single permanent hybrid\r\nrace has ever been formed, even in gardens, by the intermarriage of two\r\nallied species brought from distant habitations. Until some fact of this\r\nkind is fairly established, and a new species, capable of perpetuating\r\nitself in a state of perfect independence of man, can be pointed out, it\r\nseems reasonable to call in question entirely this hypothetical source\r\nof new species. That varieties do sometimes spring up from\r\ncross-breeds, in a natural way, can hardly be doubted; but they\r\nprobably die out even more rapidly than races propagated by grafts or\r\nlayers.\r\n\r\n_Opinion of De Candolle._--De Candolle, whose opinion on a philosophical\r\nquestion of this kind deserves the greatest attention, has observed, in\r\nhis Essay on Botanical Geography, that the _varieties_ of plants range\r\nthemselves under two general heads: those produced by external\r\ncircumstances, and those formed by hybridity. After adducing various\r\narguments to show that neither of these causes can explain the permanent\r\ndiversity of plants indigenous in different regions, he says, in regard\r\nto the crossing of races, \"I can perfectly comprehend without altogether\r\nsharing the opinion, that, where many species of the same genera occur\r\nnear together, hybrid species may be formed, and I am aware that the\r\ngreat number of species of certain genera which are found in particular\r\nregions may be explained in this manner; but I am unable to conceive how\r\nany one can regard the same explanation as applicable to species\r\nwhich live naturally at great distances. If the three larches, for\r\nexample, now known in the world, lived in the same localities, I might\r\nthen believe that one of them was the produce of the crossing of the two\r\nothers; but I never could admit that the Siberian species has been\r\nproduced by the crossing of those of Europe and America. I see, then,\r\nthat there exist in organized beings, permanent differences which cannot\r\nbe referred to any one of the actual causes of variation, and these\r\ndifferences are what constitute species.\"[834]\r\n\r\n_Reality of species confirmed by the phenomena of hybrids._--The most\r\ndecisive arguments perhaps, amongst many others, against the probability\r\nof the derivation of permanent species from cross-breeds, are to be\r\ndrawn from the fact alluded to by De Candolle, of species having a close\r\naffinity to each other occurring in distinct botanical provinces, or\r\ncountries inhabited by groups of distinct species of indigenous plants;\r\nfor in this case naturalists, who are not prepared to go the whole\r\nlength of the transmutationists, are under the necessity of admitting\r\nthat, in some cases, species which approach very near to each other in\r\ntheir characters, were so created from their origin; an admission fatal\r\nto the idea of its being a general law of nature that a few original\r\ntypes only should be formed, and that all intermediate races should\r\nspring from the intermixture of those stocks.\r\n\r\nThis notion, indeed, is wholly at variance with all that we know of\r\nhybrid generation; for the phenomena entitle us to affirm, that had the\r\ntypes been at first somewhat distinct, _no cross-breeds would ever have\r\nbeen produced_, much less those prolific races which we now recognize as\r\ndistinct species.\r\n\r\nIn regard, moreover, to the permanent propagation of hybrid races among\r\nanimals, insuperable difficulties present themselves, when we endeavor\r\nto conceive the blending together of the different instincts and\r\npropensities of two species, so as to insure the preservation of the\r\nintermediate race. The common mule, when obtained by human art, may be\r\nprotected by the power of man; but, in a wild state, it would not have\r\nprecisely the same wants either as the horse or the ass; and if in\r\nconsequence of some difference of this kind, it strayed from the herd,\r\nit would soon be hunted down by beasts of prey, and destroyed.\r\n\r\nIf we take some genus of insects, such as the bee, we find that each of\r\nthe numerous species has some difference in its habits, its mode of\r\ncollecting honey, or constructing its dwelling, or providing for its\r\nyoung, and other particulars. In the case of the common hive bee, the\r\nworkers are described, by Kirby and Spence, as being endowed with no\r\nless than thirty distinct instincts.[835] So also we find that, amongst\r\na most numerous class of spiders, there are nearly as many different\r\nmodes of spinning their webs as there are species. When we recollect how\r\ncomplicated are the relations of these instincts with co-existing\r\nspecies, both of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, it is scarcely\r\npossible to imagine that a bastard race could spring from the union of\r\ntwo of these species, and retain just so much of the qualities of each\r\nparent stock as to preserve its ground in spite of the dangers which\r\nsurround it.\r\n\r\nWe might also ask, if a few generic types alone have been _created_\r\namong insects, and the intermediate species have proceeded from\r\nhybridity, where are those original types, combining, as they ought to\r\ndo, the elements of all the instincts which have made their appearance\r\nin the numerous derivative races? So also in regard to animals of all\r\nclasses, and of plants; if species are in general of hybrid origin,\r\nwhere are the stocks which combine in themselves the habits, properties,\r\nand organs, of which all the intervening species ought to afford us mere\r\nmodifications?\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation of the arguments from hybrids._--I shall now conclude\r\nthis subject by summing up, in a few words, the results to which I have\r\nbeen led by the consideration of the phenomena of hybrids. It appears\r\nthat the aversion of individuals of distinct species to the sexual union\r\nis common to animals and plants; and that it is only when the species\r\napproach near to each other in their organization and habits, that any\r\noffspring are produced from their connexion. Mules are of extremely rare\r\noccurrence in a state of nature, and no examples are yet known of their\r\nhaving procreated in a wild state. But it has been proved, that hybrids\r\nare not universally sterile, provided the parent stocks have a near\r\naffinity to each other, although the continuation of the mixed race, for\r\nseveral generations, appears hitherto to have been obtained only by\r\ncrossing the hybrids with individuals of pure species; an experiment\r\nwhich by no means bears out the hypothesis that a true hybrid race could\r\never be permanently established.\r\n\r\nHence we may infer, that aversion to sexual intercourse is, in general,\r\na good test of the distinctness of original stocks, or of _species_; and\r\nthe procreation of hybrids is a proof of the near affinity of species.\r\nPerhaps, hereafter, the number of generations for which hybrids may be\r\ncontinued, before the race dies out (for it seems usually to degenerate\r\nrapidly), may afford the zoologist and botanist an experimental test of\r\nthe difference in the degree of affinity of allied species.\r\n\r\nI may also remark, that if it could have been shown that a single\r\npermanent species had ever been produced by hybridity (of which there is\r\nno satisfactory proof), it might certainly have lent some countenance to\r\nthe notions of the ancients respecting the gradual deterioration of\r\ncreated things, but none whatever to Lamarck's theory of their\r\nprogressive perfectibility, for observations have hitherto shown that\r\nthere is a tendency in mule animals and plants to degenerate in\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nIt was before remarked, that the theory of progressive development arose\r\npartly from an attempt to ingraft the doctrines of the transmutationists\r\nupon one of the most popular generalizations in geology. But we have\r\nseen in the ninth chapter, that the modern researches of geologists have\r\nbroken at many points the chain of evidence once supposed to exist in\r\nfavor of the doctrine, that, at each successive period in the earth's\r\nhistory, animals and plants of a higher grade, or more complex\r\norganization, have been created. The recent origin of man, and the\r\nabsence of all signs of any rational being holding an analogous relation\r\nto former states of the animate world, affords one, and perhaps in the\r\npresent state of science the only argument of much weight in support of\r\nthe hypothesis of a progressive scheme; but none whatever in favor of\r\nthe fancied evolution of one species out of another.\r\n\r\n_Theory of the gradation of intellect as shown by the facial\r\nangle._--When the celebrated anatomist, Camper, first attempted to\r\nestimate the degrees of sagacity of different animals, and of the races\r\nof man, by the measurement of the facial angle, some speculators were\r\nbold enough to affirm that certain Simiae, or apes, differed as little\r\nfrom the more savage races of men, as those do from the human race in\r\ngeneral; and that a scale might be traced from \"apes with foreheads\r\nvillanous low\" to the African variety of the human species, and from\r\nthat to the European. The facial angle was measured by drawing a line\r\nfrom the prominent centre of the forehead to the most advanced part of\r\nthe lower jaw-bone, and observing the angle which it made with the\r\nhorizontal line; and it was affirmed, that there was a regular series of\r\nsuch angles from birds to the mammalia.\r\n\r\nThe gradation from the dog to the monkey was said to be perfect, and\r\nfrom that again to man. One of the ape tribe has a facial angle of 42\r\ndegrees; and another, which approximated nearest to man in figure, an\r\nangle of 50 degrees. To this succeeds (longo sed proximus intervallo)\r\nthe head of the African negro, which, as well as that of the Calmuck,\r\nforms an angle of 70 degrees; while that of the European contains 80\r\ndegrees. The Roman painters preferred the angle of 95 degrees; and the\r\ncharacter of beauty and sublimity so striking in some works of Grecian\r\nsculpture, as in the head of the Apollo, and in the Medusa of Sisocles,\r\nis given by an angle which amounts to 100 degrees.[836]\r\n\r\nA great number of valuable facts and curious analogies in comparative\r\nanatomy were brought to light during the investigations which were made\r\nby Camper, John Hunter, and others, to illustrate this scale of\r\norganization; and their facts and generalizations must not be confounded\r\nwith the fanciful systems which White and others deduced from them.[837]\r\n\r\nThat there is some connexion between an elevated and capacious forehead,\r\nin certain races of men, and a large developement of the intellectual\r\nfaculties, seems highly probable; and that a low facial angle is\r\nfrequently accompanied with inferiority of mental powers, is certain;\r\nbut the attempt to trace a gradual scale of intelligence through the\r\ndifferent species of animals accompanying the modifications of the form\r\nof the scull, is a mere visionary speculation. It has been found\r\nnecessary to exaggerate the sagacity of the ape tribe at the expense of\r\nthe dog; and strange contradictions have arisen in the conclusions\r\ndeduced from the structure of the elephant; some anatomists being\r\ndisposed to deny the quadruped the intelligence which he really\r\npossesses, because they found that the volume of his brain was small in\r\ncomparison to that of the other mammalia; while others were inclined to\r\nmagnify extravagantly the superiority of his intellect, because the\r\nvertical height of his skull is so great when compared to its horizontal\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n_Different races of men are all of one species._--It would be irrelevant\r\nto our subject if we were to enter into a farther discussion on these\r\ntopics; because, even if a graduated scale of organization and\r\nintelligence could have been established, it would prove nothing in\r\nfavor of a tendency, in each species, to attain a higher state of\r\nperfection. I may refer the reader to the writings of Blumenbach,\r\nPrichard, Lawrence, and more recently Latham[838], for convincing proofs\r\nthat the varieties of form, color, and organization of different races\r\nof men, are perfectly consistent with the generally received opinion,\r\nthat all the individuals of the species have originated from a single\r\npair; and, while they exhibit in man as many diversities of a\r\nphysiological nature as appear in any other species, they confirm also\r\nthe opinion of the slight deviation from a common standard of which\r\nspecies are capable.\r\n\r\nThe power of existing and multiplying in every latitude, and in every\r\nvariety of situation and climate, which has enabled the great human\r\nfamily to extend itself over the habitable globe, is partly, says\r\nLawrence, the result of physical constitution, and partly of the mental\r\nprerogative of man. If he did not possess the most enduring and flexible\r\ncorporeal frame, his arts would not enable him to be the inhabitant of\r\nall climates, and to brave the extremes of heat and cold, and the other\r\ndestructive influences of local situation.[839] Yet, notwithstanding\r\nthis flexibility of bodily frame, we find no signs of indefinite\r\ndeparture from a common standard, and the intermarriages of individuals\r\nof the most remote varieties are not less fruitful than between those of\r\nthe same tribe.\r\n\r\n_Tiedemann on the brain of the foetus in vertebrated animals._--There\r\nis yet another department of anatomical discovery to which I must\r\nallude, because it has appeared to some persons to afford a distant\r\nanalogy, at least, to that progressive development by which some of the\r\ninferior species may have been gradually perfected into those of more\r\ncomplex organization. Tiedemann found, and his discoveries have been\r\nmost fully confirmed and elucidated by M. Serres, that the brain of the\r\nfoetus, in the highest class of vertebrated animals, assumes, in\r\nsuccession, forms, bearing a certain degree of resemblance to those\r\nwhich belong to fishes, reptiles, and birds, before it acquires the\r\nadditions and modifications which are peculiar to the mammiferous tribe;\r\nso that, in the passage from the embryo to the perfect mammifer, there\r\nis a typical representation, it is said, of all those transformations\r\nwhich the primitive species are supposed to have undergone, during a\r\nlong series of generations, between the present period and the remotest\r\ngeological era.\r\n\r\n\"If you examine the brain of the mammalia,\" says M. Serres, \"at an early\r\nstage of uterine life, you perceive the cerebral hemispheres\r\nconsolidated, as in fish, in two vesicles, isolated one from the other;\r\nat a later period, you see them affect the configuration of the cerebral\r\nhemispheres of reptiles; still later again, they present you with the\r\nforms of those of birds; finally they acquire, at the era of birth, and\r\nsometimes later, the permanent forms which the adult mammalia present.\r\n\r\n\"The cerebral hemispheres, then, arrive at the state which we observe in\r\nthe higher animals only by a series of successive metamorphoses. If we\r\nreduce the whole of these evolutions to four periods, we shall see, that\r\nin the first are born the cerebral lobes of fishes; and this takes place\r\nhomogeneously in all classes. The second period will give us the\r\norganization of reptiles; the third, the brain of birds; and the fourth,\r\nthe complex hemispheres of mammalia.\r\n\r\n\"If we could develop the different parts of the brain of the inferior\r\nclasses, we should make, in succession, a reptile out of a fish, a bird\r\nout of a reptile, and a mammiferous quadruped out of a bird. If, on the\r\ncontrary, we could starve this organ in the mammalia, we might reduce it\r\nsuccessively to the condition of the brain of the three inferior\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n\"Nature often presents us with this last phenomenon in monsters, but\r\nnever exhibits the first. Among the various deformities which organized\r\nbeings may experience, they never pass the limits of their own classes\r\nto put on the forms of the class above them. Never does a fish elevate\r\nitself so as to assume the form of the brain of a reptile; nor does the\r\nlatter ever attain that of birds; nor the bird that of the mammifer. It\r\nmay happen that a monster may have two heads; but the conformation of\r\nthe brain always remains circumscribed narrowly within the limits of its\r\nclass.\"[840]\r\n\r\nDr. Clark of Cambridge, in a memoir on \"Foetal Development\" (1845),\r\nhas shown that the concurrent labours of Valentin, Ratka, and Bischoff\r\ndisprove the reality of the supposed anatomical analogy between the\r\nembryo condition of certain organs in the higher orders, and the perfect\r\nstructure of the same organs in animals of an inferior class. The hearts\r\nand brains, for example, of birds and mammals do not pass through forms\r\nwhich are permanent in fishes and reptiles; there is only just so much\r\nresemblance as may point to a unity of plan running through the\r\norganization of the whole series of vertebrated animals; but which lends\r\nno support whatever to the notion of a gradual transmutation of one\r\nspecies into another; least of all of the passage, in the course of many\r\ngenerations, from an animal of a more simple to one of a more complex\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation._--For the reasons, therefore, detailed in this and the\r\ntwo preceding chapters, we may draw the following inferences in regard\r\nto the reality of _species_ in nature:--\r\n\r\n1st. That there is a capacity in all species to accommodate themselves,\r\nto a certain extent, to a change of external circumstances, this extent\r\nvarying greatly, according to the species.\r\n\r\n2ndly. When the change of situation which they can endure is great, it\r\nis usually attended by some modifications of the form, colour, size,\r\nstructure, or other particulars; but the mutations thus superinduced are\r\ngoverned by constant laws, and the capability of so varying, forms part\r\nof the permanent specific character.\r\n\r\n3dly. Some acquired peculiarities, of form, structure, and instinct, are\r\ntransmissible to the offspring; but these consist of such qualities and\r\nattributes only as are intimately related to the natural wants and\r\npropensities of the species.\r\n\r\n4thly. The entire variation from the original type, which any given kind\r\nof change can produce, may usually be effected in a brief period of\r\ntime, after which no farther deviation can be obtained by continuing to\r\nalter the circumstances, though ever so gradually; indefinite\r\ndivergence, either in the way of improvement or deterioration, being\r\nprevented, and the least possible excess beyond the defined limits being\r\nfatal to the existence of the individual.\r\n\r\n5thly. The intermixture of distinct species is guarded against by the\r\naversion of the individuals composing them to sexual union, or by the\r\nsterility of the mule offspring. It does not appear that true hybrid\r\nraces have ever been perpetuated for several generations, even by the\r\nassistance of man; for the cases usually cited relate to the crossing of\r\nmules with individuals of pure species, and not to the intermixture of\r\nhybrid with hybrid.\r\n\r\n6thly. From the above considerations, it appears that species have a\r\nreal existence in nature; and that each was endowed, at the time of its\r\ncreation, with the attributes and organization by which it is now\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nLAWS WHICH REGULATE THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Analogy of climate not attended with identity of species--Botanical\r\n    geography--Stations--Habitations--Distinct provinces of indigenous\r\n    plants--Vegetation of islands--Marine vegetation--In what manner\r\n    plants become diffused--Effects of wind, rivers, marine\r\n    currents--Agency of animals--Many seeds pass through the stomachs of\r\n    animals and birds undigested--Agency of man in the dispersion of\r\n    plants, both voluntary and involuntary--Its analogy to that of the\r\n    inferior animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to determining the question whether species have a real existence,\r\nthe consideration of the laws which regulate their geographical\r\ndistribution is a subject of primary importance to the geologist. It is\r\nonly by studying these laws with attention, by observing the positions\r\nwhich groups of species occupy at present, and inquiring how these may\r\nbe varied in the course of time by migrations, by changes in physical\r\ngeography, and other causes, that we can hope to learn whether the\r\nduration of species be limited, or in what manner the state of the\r\nanimate world is affected by the endless vicissitudes of the inanimate.\r\n\r\n_Different regions inhabited by distinct species._--That different\r\nregions of the globe are inhabited by entirely distinct animals and\r\nplants, is a fact which has been familiar to all naturalists since\r\nBuffon first pointed out the want of _specific_ identity between the\r\nland quadrupeds of America and those of the Old World. The same\r\nphenomenon has, in later times, been forced in a striking manner upon\r\nour attention, by the examination of New Holland, where the indigenous\r\nspecies of animals and plants were found to be, almost without\r\nexception, distinct from those known in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nBut the extent of this parcelling out of the globe amongst different\r\n_nations_, as they have been termed, of plants and animals--the\r\nuniversality of a phenomenon so extraordinary and unexpected, may be\r\nconsidered as one of the most interesting facts clearly established by\r\nthe advance of modern science.\r\n\r\nScarcely fourteen hundred species of plants appear to have been known\r\nand described by the Greeks, Romans, and Arabians. At present, more than\r\nthree thousand species are enumerated, as natives of our own\r\nisland.[841] In other parts of the world there have been now collected\r\n(1846) upwards of 100,000 species, specimens of which are preserved in\r\nEuropean herbariums. It was not to be supposed, therefore, that the\r\nancients should have acquired any correct notions respecting what may be\r\ncalled the geography of plants, although the influence of climate on the\r\ncharacter of the vegetation could hardly have escaped their observation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntecedently to investigation, there was no reason for presuming that\r\nthe vegetable productions, growing wild in the eastern hemisphere,\r\nshould be unlike those of the western, in the same latitude; nor that\r\nthe plants of the Cape of Good Hope should be unlike those of the south\r\nof Europe; situations where the climate is little dissimilar. The\r\ncontrary supposition would have seemed more probable, and we might have\r\nanticipated an almost perfect identity in the animals and plants which\r\ninhabit corresponding parallels of latitude. The discovery, therefore,\r\nthat each separate region of the globe, both of the land and water, is\r\noccupied by distinct groups of species, and that most of the exceptions\r\nto this general rule may be referred to disseminating causes now in\r\noperation, is eminently calculated to excite curiosity, and to stimulate\r\nus to seek some hypothesis respecting the first introduction of species\r\nwhich may be reconcileable with such phenomena.\r\n\r\n_Botanical geography._--A comparison of the _plants_ of different\r\nregions of the globe affords results more to be depended upon in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge than those relating to the animal\r\nkingdom, because the science of botany is more advanced, and probably\r\ncomprehends a great proportion of the total number of the vegetable\r\nproductions of the whole earth. Humboldt, in several eloquent passages\r\nof his Personal Narrative, was among the first to promulgate\r\nphilosophical views on this subject. Every hemisphere, says this\r\ntraveller, produces plants of different species; and it is not by the\r\ndiversity of climates that we can attempt to explain why equinoctial\r\nAfrica has no Laurinae, and the New World no Heaths; why the Calceolariae\r\nare found only in the southern hemisphere; why the birds of the\r\ncontinent of India glow with colors less splendid than the birds of the\r\nhot parts of America: finally, why the tiger is peculiar to Asia, and\r\nthe ornithorhynchus to New Holland.[842]\r\n\r\n\"We can conceive,\" he adds, \"that a small number of the families of\r\nplants, for instance, the Musaceae and the Palms, cannot belong to very\r\ncold regions, on account of their internal structure and the importance\r\nof certain organs; but we cannot explain why no one of the family of\r\nMelastomas vegetates north of the parallel of thirty degrees; or why no\r\nrose-tree belongs to the southern hemisphere. Analogy of climates is\r\noften found in the two continents without identity of productions.\"[843]\r\n\r\nThe luminous essay of De Candolle on \"Botanical Geography\" presents us\r\nwith the fruits of his own researches and those of Humboldt, Brown, and\r\nother eminent botanists, so arranged, that the principal phenomena of\r\nthe distribution of plants are exhibited in connexion with the causes to\r\nwhich they are chiefly referrible.[844] \"It might not, perhaps, be\r\ndifficult,\" observes this writer, \"to find two points, in the United\r\nStates and in Europe, or in Equinoctial America and Africa, which\r\npresent all the same circumstances: as, for example, the same\r\ntemperature, the same height above the sea, a similar soil, an equal\r\ndose of humidity; yet nearly all, _perhaps all_, the plants in these two\r\nsimilar localities shall be distinct. A certain degree of analogy,\r\nindeed, of aspect, and even of structure, might very possibly be\r\ndiscoverable between the plants of the two localities in question; but\r\nthe _species_ would in general be different. Circumstances, therefore,\r\ndifferent from those which now determine the _stations_, have had an\r\ninfluence on the _habitations_ of plants.\"\r\n\r\n_Stations and habitations of plants._--As I shall frequently have\r\noccasion to speak of the _stations_ and _habitations_ of plants in the\r\ntechnical sense in which the terms are used in the above passage, I may\r\nremind the geologist that station indicates the peculiar nature of the\r\nlocality where each species is accustomed to grow, and has reference to\r\nclimate, soil, humidity, light, elevation above the sea, and other\r\nanalogous circumstances; whereas, by habitation is meant a general\r\nindication of the country where a plant grows wild. Thus the _station_\r\nof a plant may be a salt-marsh, a hill-side, the bed of the sea, or a\r\nstagnant pool. Its _habitation_ may be Europe, North America, or New\r\nHolland, between the tropics. The study of stations has been styled the\r\ntopography, that of habitations the geography, of botany. The terms thus\r\ndefined, express each a distinct class of ideas, which have been often\r\nconfounded together, and which are equally applicable in zoology.\r\n\r\nIn farther illustration of the principle above alluded to, that\r\ndifference of longitude, independently of any influence of temperature,\r\nis accompanied by a great, and sometimes a complete, diversity in the\r\nspecies of plants, De Candolle observes, that, out of 2891 species of\r\nphaenogamous plants described by Pursh, in the United States, there are\r\nonly 385 which are found in northern or temperate Europe. MM. Humboldt\r\nand Bonpland, in all their travels through equinoctial America, found\r\nonly twenty-four species (these being all Cyperaceae and Gramineae) common\r\nto America and any part of the Old World. They collected, it is true,\r\nchiefly on the mountains, or the proportion would have been larger; for\r\nDr. J. Hooker informs me that many tropical plants of the New World are\r\nidentical with African species. Nevertheless, the general discordance of\r\nthese Floras is very striking. On comparing New Holland with Europe, Mr.\r\nBrown ascertained that, out of 4100 species, discovered in Australia,\r\nthere were only 166 common to Europe, and of this small number there\r\nwere some few which may have been transported thither by man. Almost all\r\nof the 166 species were cryptogamic, and the rest consist, in nearly\r\nevery case, of phaenogamous plants which also inhabit intervening\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nBut what is still more remarkable, in the more widely separated parts of\r\nthe ancient continent, notwithstanding the existence of an uninterrupted\r\nland-communication, the diversity in the specific character of the\r\nrespective vegetations is almost as striking. Thus there is found one\r\nassemblage of species in China, another in the countries bordering the\r\nBlack Sea and the Caspian, a third in those surrounding the\r\nMediterranean, a fourth in the great platforms of Siberia and Tartary,\r\nand so forth.\r\n\r\nThe distinctness of the groups of indigenous plants, in the same\r\nparallel of latitude, is greatest where continents are disjoined by a\r\nwide expanse of ocean. In the northern hemisphere, near the pole, where\r\nthe extremities of Europe, Asia, and America unite or approach near to\r\none another, a considerable number of the same species of plants are\r\nfound, common to the three continents. But it has been remarked, that\r\nthese plants, which are thus so widely diffused in the arctic regions,\r\nare also found in the chain of the Aleutian islands, which stretch\r\nalmost across from America to Asia, and which may probably have served\r\nas the channel of communication for the partial blending of the Floras\r\nof the adjoining regions. It has, indeed, been observed to be a general\r\nrule, that plants found at two points very remote from each other occur\r\nalso in places intermediate.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Hooker informs me that in high latitudes in the southern ocean,\r\nin spite of the great extent of the sea, Floras of widely disconnected\r\nislands contain many species in common. Perhaps icebergs, transporting\r\nto vast distances not only stones, but soil with the seeds of plants,\r\nmay explain this unusually wide diffusion of insular plants.\r\n\r\nIn islands very distant from continents the total number of plants is\r\ncomparatively small; but a large proportion of the species are such as\r\noccur nowhere else. In so far as the Flora of such islands is not\r\npeculiar to them, it contains, in general, species common to the nearest\r\nmain lands.[845] The islands of the great southern ocean exemplify these\r\nrules; the easternmost containing more American, and the western more\r\nIndian plants.[846] Madeira and Teneriffe contain many species, and even\r\nentire genera, peculiar to them; but they have also plants in common\r\nwith Portugal, Spain, the Azores, and the north-west coast of\r\nAfrica.[847]\r\n\r\nIn the Canaries, out of 533 species of phaenogamous plants, it is said\r\nthat 310 are peculiar to these islands, and the rest identical with\r\nthose of the African continent; but in the Flora of St. Helena, which is\r\nso far distant even from the western shores of Africa, there have been\r\nfound, out of thirty native species of the phaenogamous class, only _one\r\nor two_ which are to be found in any other part of the globe. On the\r\nother hand, of sixty cryptogamic plants, collected by Dr. J. Hooker in\r\nthe same island, twelve only were peculiar.\r\n\r\nThe natural history of the Galapagos archipelago, described by Mr.\r\nDarwin, affords another very instructive illustration of the laws\r\ngoverning the geographical distribution of plants and animals in\r\nislands. This group consists of ten principal islands, situated in the\r\nPacific Ocean, under the equator, about 600 miles westward of the coast\r\nof South America. As they are all formed of volcanic rocks, many of the\r\ncraters, of which there are about 2000 in number, having a very fresh\r\naspect, we may regard the whole as much more modern in origin than the\r\nmass of the adjoining continent; yet neither has the Flora nor Fauna\r\nbeen derived from South America, but consist of species for the most\r\npart indigenous, yet stamped with a character decidedly South American.\r\n\r\nWhat is still more singular, there is a difference between the species\r\ninhabiting the different islands. Of flowering plants, for example,\r\nthere are 185 species at present known, and forty cryptogamic, making\r\ntogether 225. One hundred of the former class are new species, probably\r\nconfined to this archipelago; and of the rest, ten at least have been\r\nintroduced by man. Of twenty-one species of _Compositae_, all but one are\r\npeculiar, and they belong to twelve genera, no less than ten of which\r\ngenera are confined to the Galapagos. Dr. Hooker observes, that the type\r\nof this Flora has an undoubted relation to that of the western side of\r\nSouth America, and he detects in it no affinity with that of the\r\nnumerous islands scattered over other parts of the Pacific. So in regard\r\nto the birds, reptiles, land-shells, and insects, this archipelago,\r\nstanding as it does in the Pacific Ocean, is zoologically part of\r\nAmerica. Although each small island is not more than fifty or sixty\r\nmiles apart, and most of them are in sight of each other, formed of\r\nprecisely the same rocks, rising nearly to an equal height, and placed\r\nunder a similar climate, they are tenanted each by a different set of\r\nbeings, the tortoises, mocking-thrushes, finches, beetles, scarcely any\r\nof them ever ranging over the whole, and often not even common to any\r\ntwo of the islands.\r\n\r\n\"The archipelago,\" says Mr. Darwin, \"is a little world within itself, or\r\nrather a satellite attached to America; whence it has derived a few\r\nstray colonists, and has received the general character of its\r\nindigenous productions. One is astonished,\" he adds, \"at the amount of\r\ncreative force displayed on so many small, barren, and rocky islands,\r\nand still more so, at its diverse, yet analogous action on points so\r\nnear each other. I have said that the Galapagos archipelago might be\r\ncalled a satellite attached to America, but it should rather be called a\r\ngroup of satellites physically similar, organically distinct, yet\r\nintimately related to each other, and all related in a marked, though\r\nmuch lesser degree, to the great American continent.\"[848]\r\n\r\n_Number of botanical provinces._--De Candolle has enumerated twenty\r\ngreat botanical provinces inhabited by indigenous or aboriginal plants;\r\nand although many of these contain a variety of species which are common\r\nto several others, and sometimes to places very remote, yet the lines of\r\ndemarcation are, upon the whole, astonishingly well defined.[849] Nor is\r\nit likely that the bearing of the evidence on which these general views\r\nare founded will ever be materially affected, since they are already\r\nconfirmed by the examination of nearly one hundred thousand species of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe entire change of opinion which the contemplation of those phenomena\r\nhas brought about is worthy of remark. The first travellers were\r\npersuaded that they should find, in distant regions, the plants of their\r\nown country, and they took a pleasure in giving them the same names. It\r\nwas some time before this illusion was dissipated; but so fully sensible\r\ndid botanists at last become of the extreme smallness of the number of\r\nphaenogamous plants common to different continents, that the ancient\r\nFloras fell into disrepute. All grew diffident of the pretended\r\nidentifications; and we now find that every naturalist is inclined to\r\nexamine each supposed exception with scrupulous severity.[850] If they\r\nadmit the fact, they begin to speculate on the mode whereby the seeds\r\nmay have been transported from one country into the other, or enquire on\r\nwhich of two continents the plant was indigenous, assuming that a\r\nspecies, like an individual, cannot have two birthplaces.\r\n\r\n_Marine vegetation._--The marine vegetation is divisible into different\r\nsystems, like those prevailing on the land; but they are much fewer, as\r\nwe might have expected, the temperature of the ocean being more uniform\r\nthan that of the atmosphere, and consequently the dispersion of species\r\nfrom one zone to another being less frequently checked by the\r\nintervention of uncongenial climates. The proportion also of land to sea\r\nthroughout the globe being small, the migration of marine plants is not\r\nso often stopped by barriers of land, as is that of the terrestrial\r\nspecies by the ocean. The number of hydrophytes, as they are termed, is\r\nvery considerable, and their stations are found to be infinitely more\r\nvaried than could have been anticipated; for while some plants are\r\ncovered and uncovered daily by the tide, others live at the depth of\r\nseveral hundred feet. Among the known provinces of Algae, we may mention,\r\n1st, The north circumpolar, from lat 60 degrees N. to the pole; 2dly,\r\nThe North Atlantic or the region of Fucus proper and Delesseriae,\r\nextending from lat. 40 degrees N. to lat. 60 degrees N.; 3dly, That of\r\nthe Mediterranean, which may be regarded as a sub-region of the _fourth_\r\nor warmer temperate zone of the Atlantic, between lat. 23 degrees N. and\r\nlat. 40 degrees N.; 5thly, The Tropical Atlantic, in which Sargassum,\r\nRhodomelia, Corallinea, and Siphonia abound; 6thly, The South Atlantic,\r\nwhere the Fucus reappears; 7thly, The Antarctic American, comprehending\r\nfrom Chili to Cape Horn, the Falkland Islands, and thence round the\r\nworld south of latitude 50 degrees S.; 8thly, The Australian and New\r\nZealand, which is very peculiar, being characterized, among other\r\ngeneric forms, by Cystoseiriae and Fuceae; 9thly, The Indian Ocean and\r\nRed Sea; and, 10thly, The Chinese and Japanese seas.[851] In addition to\r\nthe above provinces, there are several others not yet well determined in\r\nthe Pacific Ocean and elsewhere. There are, however, many species which\r\nrange through several of these geographical regions of subaqueous\r\nvegetation, being common to very remote countries; as, for example, to\r\nthe coasts of\r\n\r\nEurope and the United States, and others, to Cape Horn and Van Diemen's\r\nLand, the same plants extending also for the most part to the New\r\nZealand sea. Of the _species_ strictly antarctic (excluding the New\r\nZealand and Tasmanian groups) Dr. Hooker has identified not less than a\r\nfifth part of the whole with British Algae! Yet is there a much smaller\r\nproportion of cosmopolite species among the Algae than among the\r\nterrestrial cellular plants, such as lichens, mosses, and Hepaticae.\r\n\r\nIt must always be borne in mind, that the distinctness alluded to\r\nbetween the provinces, whether of subaqueous or terrestrial plants,\r\nrelates strictly to _species_, and not to forms. In regard to the\r\nnumerical preponderance of certain forms, and many peculiarities of\r\ninternal structure, there is usually a marked agreement in the vegetable\r\nproductions of districts placed in corresponding latitudes, and under\r\nsimilar physical circumstances, however remote their position. Thus\r\nthere are innumerable points of analogy between the vegetation of the\r\nBrazils, equinoctial Africa, and India; and there are also points of\r\ndifference wherein the plants of these regions are distinguishable from\r\nall extra-tropical groups. But there is a very small proportion of the\r\nentire number of species common to the three continents. The same may be\r\nsaid, if we compare the plants of the United States with that of the\r\nmiddle of Europe; the species are distinct, but the forms are often so\r\nanalogous, as to have been styled \"geographical representatives.\" There\r\nare very few _species_ of phaenogamous plants, says Dr. J. Hooker, common\r\nto Van Diemen's Land, New Zealand, and Fuegia, but a great many\r\n_genera_, and some of them are confined to those three distant regions\r\nof the southern hemisphere, being in many instances each severally\r\nrepresented by a single species. The same naturalist also observes that\r\nthe southern temperate as well as the antarctic regions, possess each of\r\nthem representatives of some of the genera of the analogous climates of\r\nthe opposite hemisphere; but very few of the species are identical\r\nunless they be such as are equally diffused over other countries, or\r\nwhich inhabit the Andes, by the aid of which they have evidently\r\neffected their passage southwards.\r\n\r\n_Manner in which plants become diffused.--Winds._--Let us now consider\r\nwhat means of diffusion, independently of the agency of man, are\r\npossessed by plants, whereby, in the course of ages, they may be enabled\r\nto stray from one of the botanical provinces above mentioned to another,\r\nand to establish new colonies at a great distance from their birthplace.\r\n\r\nThe principal of the inanimate agents provided by nature for scattering\r\nthe seeds of plants over the globe, are the movements of the atmosphere\r\nand of the ocean, and the constant flow of water from the mountains to\r\nthe sea. To begin with the winds: a great number of seeds, are furnished\r\nwith downy and feathery appendages, enabling them, when ripe, to float\r\nin the air, and to be wafted easily to great distances by the most\r\ngentle breeze. Other plants are fitted for dispersion by means of an\r\nattached wing, as in the case of the fir tree, so that they are caught\r\nup by the wind as they fall from the cone, and are carried to a\r\ndistance. Amongst the comparatively small number of plants known to\r\nLinnaeus, no less than 138 genera are enumerated as having winged seeds.\r\n\r\nAs winds often prevail for days, weeks, or even months together, in the\r\nsame direction, these means of transportation may sometimes be without\r\nlimits; and even the heavier grains may be borne through considerable\r\nspaces, in a very short time, during ordinary tempests; for strong\r\ngales, which can sweep along grains of sand, often move at the rate of\r\nabout forty miles an hour, and if the storm be very violent, at the rate\r\nof fifty-six miles.[852] The hurricanes of tropical regions, which root\r\nup trees and throw down buildings, sweep along at the rate of ninety\r\nmiles an hour; so that, for however short a time they prevail, they may\r\ncarry even the heavier fruits and seeds over friths and seas of\r\nconsiderable width, and doubtless are often the means of introducing\r\ninto islands the vegetation of adjoining continents. Whirlwinds are also\r\ninstrumental in bearing along heavy vegetable substances to considerable\r\ndistances. Slight ones may frequently be observed in our fields, in\r\nsummer carrying up haycocks into the air, and then letting fall small\r\ntufts of hay far and wide over the country; but they are sometimes so\r\npowerful as to dry up lakes and ponds, and to break off the boughs of\r\ntrees, and carry them up in a whirling column of air.\r\n\r\nFranklin tells us, in one of his letters, that he saw, in Maryland, a\r\nwhirlwind which began by taking up the dust which lay in the road, in\r\nthe form of a sugar loaf with the pointed end downwards, and soon after\r\ngrew to the height of forty or fifty feet, being twenty or thirty in\r\ndiameter. It advanced in a direction contrary to the wind; and although\r\nthe rotary motion of the column was surprisingly rapid, its onward\r\nprogress was sufficiently slow to allow a man to keep pace with it on\r\nfoot. Franklin followed it on horseback, accompanied by his son, for\r\nthree quarters of a mile, and saw it enter a wood, where it twisted and\r\nturned round large trees with surprising force. These were carried up in\r\na spiral line, and were seen flying in the air, together with boughs and\r\ninnumerable leaves, which, from their height, appeared reduced to the\r\napparent size of flies. As this cause operates at different intervals of\r\ntime throughout a great portion of the earth's surface, it may be the\r\nmeans of bearing not only plants but insects, land testacea and their\r\neggs, with many other species of animals, to points which they could\r\nnever otherwise have reached, and from which they may then begin to\r\npropagate themselves again as from a new centre.\r\n\r\n_Distribution of cryptogamous plants._--It has been found that a great\r\nnumerical proportion of the exceptions to the limitation of species to\r\ncertain quarters of the globe occur in the various tribes of cryptogamic\r\nplants. Linnaeus observed that, as the germs of plants of this class,\r\nsuch as mosses, fungi, and lichens, consist of an impalpable powder, the\r\nparticles of which are scarcely visible to the naked eye, there is no\r\ndifficulty to account for their being dispersed throughout the\r\natmosphere, and carried to every point of the globe, where there is a\r\nstation fitted for them.\r\nLichens in particular ascend to great elevations, sometimes growing two\r\nthousand feet above the line of perpetual snow, at the utmost limits of\r\nvegetation, and where the mean temperature is nearly at the freezing\r\npoint. This elevated position must contribute greatly to facilitate the\r\ndispersion of those buoyant particles of which their fructification\r\nconsists.[853]\r\n\r\nSome have inferred, from the springing up of mushrooms whenever\r\nparticular soils and decomposed organic matter are mixed together, that\r\nthe production of fungi is accidental, and not analogous to that of\r\nperfect plants. But Fries, whose authority on these questions is\r\nentitled to the highest respect, has shown the fallacy of this argument\r\nin favor of the old doctrine of equivocal generation. \"The sporules of\r\nfungi,\" says this naturalist, \"are so infinite, that in a single\r\nindividual of _Reticularia maxima_, I have counted above ten millions,\r\nand so subtile as to be scarcely visible, often resembling thin smoke;\r\nso light that they may be raised perhaps by evaporation into the\r\natmosphere, and dispersed in so many ways by the attraction of the sun,\r\nby insects, wind, elasticity, adhesion, &c., that it is difficult to\r\nconceive a place from which they may be excluded.\"[854]\r\n\r\nThe club-moss called _Lycopodium cernuum_ affords a striking example of\r\na cryptogamous plant universally distributed over all equinoctial\r\ncountries. It scarcely ever passes beyond the northern tropic, except in\r\none instance, where it appears around the hot-springs in the Azores,\r\nalthough it is neither an inhabitant of the Canaries nor Madeira.\r\nDoubtless its microscopic sporules are everywhere present, ready to\r\ngerminate on any spot where they can enjoy throughout the year the\r\nproper quantity of warmth, moisture, light, and other conditions\r\nessential to the species.\r\n\r\nAlmost every lichen brought home from the southern hemisphere by the\r\nantarctic expedition under Sir James Ross, amounting to no less than 200\r\nspecies, was ascertained to be also an inhabitant of the northern\r\nhemisphere, and almost all of them European.\r\n\r\n_Agency of rivers and currents._--In considering, in the next place, the\r\ninstrumentality of the aqueous agents of dispersion, I cannot do better\r\nthan cite the words of one of our ablest botanical writers. \"The\r\nmountain stream or torrent,\" observes Keith, \"washes down to the valley\r\nthe seeds which may accidentally fall into it, or which it may happen to\r\nsweep from its banks when it suddenly overflows them. The broad and\r\nmajestic river, winding along the extensive plain, and traversing the\r\ncontinents of the world, conveys to the distance of many hundreds of\r\nmiles the seeds that may have vegetated at its source. Thus the southern\r\nshores of the Baltic are visited by seeds which grew in the interior of\r\nGermany, and the western shores of the Atlantic by seeds that have been\r\ngenerated in the interior of America.\"[855] Fruits, moreover, indigenous\r\nto America and the West Indies, such as that of the _Mimosa scandens_,\r\nthe cashewnut and others, have been known to be drifted across the\r\nAtlantic by the Gulf stream, on the western coasts of Europe, in such a\r\nstate that they might have vegetated had the climate and soil been\r\nfavourable. Among these the _Guilandina Bonduc_, a leguminous plant, is\r\nparticularly mentioned, as having been raised from a seed found on the\r\nwest coast of Ireland.[856]\r\n\r\nSir Hans Sloane states, that several kinds of beans cast ashore on the\r\nOrkney Isles, and Ireland, but none of which appear to have naturalized\r\nthemselves, are derived from trees which grow in the West Indies, and\r\nmany of them in Jamaica. He conjectures that they might have been\r\nconveyed by rivers into the sea, and then by the Gulf stream to greater\r\ndistances, in the same manner as the sea-weed called _Lenticula marina_,\r\nor Sargasso, which grows on the rocks about Jamaica, is known to be\r\n\"carried by the winds and current towards the coast of Florida, and\r\nthence into the North American ocean, where it lies very thick on the\r\nsurface of the sea.\"[857]\r\n\r\nThe absence of liquid matter in the composition of seeds renders them\r\ncomparatively insensible to heat and cold, so that they may be carried\r\nwithout detriment through climates where the plants themselves would\r\ninstantly perish. Such is their power of resisting the effects of heat,\r\nthat Spallanzani mentions some seeds that germinated after having been\r\nboiled in water.[858] Sir John Herschel informs me that he has sown at\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope the seeds of the _Acacia lophanta_ after they had\r\nremained for twelve hours in water of 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and they\r\ngerminated far more rapidly than unboiled seeds. He also states that an\r\neminent botanist, Baron Ludwig, could not get the seeds of a species of\r\ncedar to grow at the Cape till they were thoroughly boiled.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore, a strong gale, after blowing violently off the land for\r\na time, dies away, and the seeds alight upon the surface of the waters,\r\nor wherever the ocean, by eating away the sea-cliffs, throws down into\r\nits waves plants which would never otherwise reach the shores, the tides\r\nand currents become active instruments in assisting the dissemination of\r\nalmost all classes of the vegetable kingdom. The pandanus and many other\r\nplants have been distributed in this way over the islands of the\r\nPacific. I have before called attention (p. 618.) to the interesting\r\nfact that one-fifth of all the algae found in the antarctic regions in\r\n1841-3, by Dr. J. Hooker, were of species common to the British seas. He\r\nhas suggested that cold currents which prevail from Cape Horn to the\r\nequator, and are there met by other cold water, may by their direct\r\ninfluence, as well as by their temperature, facilitate the passage of\r\nantarctic species to the Arctic Ocean. In like manner the migration of\r\ncertain marine animals from the southern to the northern hemisphere may\r\nhave been brought about by the same cause.\r\n\r\nIn a collection of six hundred plants from the neighborhood of the river\r\nZaire, in Africa, Mr. Brown found that thirteen species were also met\r\nwith on the opposite shores of Guiana and Brazil. He remarked that most\r\nof these plants were found only on the lower parts of the river Zaire,\r\nand were chiefly such as produced seeds capable of retaining their\r\nvitality a long time in the currents of the ocean. Dr. J. Hooker informs\r\nme that after an examination of a great many insular floras, he has\r\nfound that no one of the large natural orders is so rich in species\r\ncommon to other countries, as the Leguminosae. The seeds in this order,\r\nwhich comprises the largest proportion of widely diffused littoral\r\nspecies, are better adapted than those of any other plants for\r\nwater-carriage.\r\n\r\n_The migration of plants aided by islands._--Islands, moreover, and even\r\nthe smallest rocks, play an important part in aiding such migrations;\r\nfor when seeds alight upon them from the atmosphere, or are thrown up by\r\nthe surf, they often vegetate, and supply the winds and waves with a\r\nrepetition of new and uninjured crops of fruit and seeds. These may\r\nafterwards pursue their course through the atmosphere, or along the\r\nsurface of the sea, in the same direction. The number of plants found at\r\nany given time on an islet affords us no test whatever of the extent to\r\nwhich it may have co-operated towards this end, since a variety of\r\nspecies may first thrive there and then perish, and be followed by other\r\nchance-comers like themselves. If neither St. Helena nor Ascension have\r\npromoted the botanical intercourse between the Old and New Worlds, we\r\nmay easily account for the fact by remembering that they are not only\r\nextremely minute and isolated spots, but are also bounded by lofty and\r\nprecipitous shores without beaches, where the seeds of foreign species\r\ncould readily establish themselves.\r\n\r\nCurrents and winds in the arctic regions drift along icebergs covered\r\nwith an alluvial soil, on which herbs and pine-saplings are seen\r\ngrowing, which may often continue to vegetate on some distant shore\r\nwhere the ice-island is stranded.\r\n\r\n_Dispersion of marine plants._--With respect to marine vegetation, the\r\nseeds, being in their native element, may remain immersed in water\r\nwithout injury for indefinite periods, so that there is no difficulty in\r\nconceiving the diffusion of species wherever uncongenial climates,\r\ncontrary currents, and other causes do not interfere. All are familiar\r\nwith the sight of the floating sea-weed,\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Flung from the rock on ocean's foam to sail,\r\n  Where'er the surge may sweep, the tempest's breath prevail.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRemarkable accumulations of that species of sea-weed generally known as\r\ngulf-weed, or sargasso, occur on each side of the equator in the\r\nAtlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Columbus and other navigators, who\r\nfirst encountered these banks of algae in the Northern Atlantic, compared\r\nthem to vast inundated meadows, and state that they retarded the\r\nprogress of their vessels. The most extensive bank is a little west of\r\nthe meridian of Fayal, one of the Azores, between latitudes 35 degrees\r\nand 36 degrees: violent north-winds sometimes prevail in this space, and\r\ndrive the sea-weed to low latitudes, as far as the 24th or even the 20th\r\ndegree.[859] Along the northern edge of the Gulf stream Dr. Hooker found\r\n_Fucus nodosus_, and _F. serratus_, which he traced all the way from\r\nlat. 36 degrees N. to England.\r\n\r\nThe hollow pod-like receptacle in which the seeds of many algae are\r\nlodged, and the filaments attached to the seed-vessels of others, seem\r\nintended to give buoyancy; and I may observe that these hydrophytes are\r\nin general _proliferous_, so that the smallest fragment of a branch can\r\nbe developed into a perfect plant. The seeds, moreover, of the greater\r\nnumber of species are enveloped with a mucous matter like that which\r\nsurrounds the eggs of some fish, and which not only protects them from\r\ninjury, but serves to attach them to floating bodies or to rocks.\r\n\r\n_Agency of animals in the distribution of plants._--But we have as yet\r\nconsidered part only of the fertile resources of nature for conveying\r\nseeds to a distance from their place of growth. The various tribes of\r\nanimals are busily engaged in furthering an object whence they derive\r\nsuch important advantages. Sometimes an express provision is found in\r\nthe structure of seeds to enable them to adhere firmly by prickles,\r\nhooks, and hairs, to the coats of animals, or feathers of the winged\r\ntribe, to which they remain attached for weeks, or even months, and are\r\nborne along into every region whither birds or quadrupeds may migrate.\r\nLinnaeus enumerates fifty genera of plants, and the number now known to\r\nbotanists is much greater, which are armed with hooks, by which, when\r\nripe, they adhere to the coats of animals. Most of these vegetables, he\r\nremarks, require a soil enriched with dung. Few have failed to mark the\r\nlocks of wool hanging on the thorn-bushes, wherever the sheep pass, and\r\nit is probable that the wolf or lion never give-chase to herbivorous\r\nanimals without being unconsciously subservient to this part of the\r\nvegetable economy.\r\n\r\nA deer has strayed from the herd when browsing on some rich pasture,\r\nwhen he is suddenly alarmed by the approach of his foe. He instantly\r\ntakes to flight, dashing through many a thicket, and swimming across\r\nmany a river and lake. The seeds of the herbs and shrubs which have\r\nadhered to his smoking flanks are washed off again by the waters. The\r\nthorny spray is torn off, and fixes itself in its hairy coat, until\r\nbrushed off again in other thickets and copses. Even on the spot where\r\nthe victim is devoured many of the seeds which he had swallowed\r\nimmediately before the chase may be left on the ground uninjured, and\r\nready to spring up in a new soil.\r\n\r\nThe passage, indeed, of undigested seeds through the stomachs of animals\r\nis one of the most efficient causes of the dissemination of plants, and\r\nis of all others, perhaps, the most likely to be overlooked. Few are\r\nignorant that a portion of the oats eaten by a horse preserve their\r\ngerminating faculty in the dung. The fact of their being still\r\nnutritious is not lost on the sagacious rook. To many, says Linnaeus, it\r\nseems extraordinary, and something of a prodigy, that when a field is\r\nwell tilled and sown with the best wheat, it frequently produces darnel\r\nor the wild oat, especially if it be manured with new dung; they do not\r\nconsider that the fertility of the smaller seeds is not destroyed in the\r\nstomachs of animals.[860]\r\n\r\n_Agency of birds._--Some birds of the order Passeres devour the seeds of\r\nplants in great quantities, which they eject again in very distant\r\nplaces, without destroying its faculty of vegetation: thus a flight of\r\nlarks will fill the cleanest field with a great quantity of various\r\nkinds of plants, as the melilot trefoil (_Medicago lupulina_), and\r\nothers whose seeds are so heavy that the wind is not able to scatter\r\nthem to any distance.[861] In like manner, the blackbird and\r\nmisselthrush, when they devour berries in too great quantities, are\r\nknown to consign them to the earth undigested in their excrement.[862]\r\n\r\nPulpy fruits serve quadrupeds and birds as food, while their seeds,\r\noften hard and indigestible, pass uninjured through the intestines, and\r\nare deposited far from their original place of growth in a condition\r\npeculiarly fit for vegetation.[863] So well are the farmers, in some\r\nparts of England, aware of this fact, that when they desire to raise a\r\nquickset hedge in the shortest possible time, they feed turkeys with the\r\nhaws of the common white-thorn (_Crataegus Oxyacantha_), and then sow the\r\nstones which are ejected in their excrement, whereby they gain an entire\r\nyear in the growth of the plant.[864] Birds, when they pluck cherries,\r\nsloes, and haws, fly away with them to some convenient place; and when\r\nthey have devoured the fruit, drop the stone into the ground. Captain\r\nCook, in his account of the volcanic island of Tanna, one of the New\r\nHebrides, which he visited in his second voyage, makes the following\r\ninteresting observation:--\"Mr. Forster, in his botanical excursion this\r\nday, shot a pigeon, in the craw of which was a wild nutmeg.\"[865] It is\r\neasy, therefore, to perceive, that birds in their migrations to great\r\ndistances, and even across seas, may transport seeds to new isles and\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nThe sudden deaths to which great numbers of frugivorous birds are\r\nannually exposed must not be omitted as auxiliary to the transportation\r\nof seeds to new habitations. When the sea retires from the shore, and\r\nleaves fruits and seeds on the beach, or in the mud of estuaries, it\r\nmight, by the returning tide, wash them away again, or destroy them by\r\nlong immersion; but when they are gathered by land birds which frequent\r\nthe sea side, or by waders and water-fowl, they are often borne inland;\r\nand if the bird to whose crop they have been consigned is killed, they\r\nmay be left to grow up far from the sea. Let such an accident happen but\r\nonce in a century, or a thousand years, it will be sufficient to spread\r\nmany of the plants from one continent to another; for in estimating the\r\nactivity of these causes, we must not consider whether they act slowly\r\nin relation to the period of our observation, but in reference to the\r\nduration of species in general.\r\n\r\nLet us trace the operation of this cause in connection with others. A\r\ntempestuous wind bears the seeds of a plant many miles through the air,\r\nand then delivers them to the ocean; the oceanic current drifts them to\r\na distant continent; by the fall of the tide they become the food of\r\nnumerous birds, and one of these is seized by a hawk or eagle, which,\r\nsoaring across hill and dale to a place of retreat, leaves, after\r\ndevouring its prey, the unpalatable seeds to spring up and flourish in a\r\nnew soil.\r\n\r\nThe machinery before adverted to, is so capable of disseminating seeds\r\nover almost unbounded spaces, that were we more intimately acquainted\r\nwith the economy of nature, we might probably explain all the instances\r\nwhich occur of the aberration of plants to great distances from their\r\nnative countries. The real difficulty which must present itself to every\r\none who contemplates the present geographical distribution of species,\r\nis the small number of exceptions to the rule of the non-intermixture of\r\ndifferent groups of plants. Why have they not, supposing them to have\r\nbeen ever so distinct originally, become more blended and confounded\r\ntogether in the lapse of ages?\r\n\r\n_Agency of man in the dispersion of plants._--But in addition to all the\r\nagents already enumerated as instrumental in diffusing plants over the\r\nglobe, we have still to consider man--one of the most important of all.\r\nHe transports with him, into every region, the vegetables which he\r\ncultivates for his wants, and is the involuntary means of spreading a\r\nstill greater number which are useless to him, or even noxious. \"When\r\nthe introduction of cultivated plants,\" says De Candolle, \"is of recent\r\ndate, there is no difficulty in tracing their origin; but when it is of\r\nhigh antiquity, we are often ignorant of the true country of the plants\r\non which we feed. No one contests the American origin of the maize or\r\nthe potatoe; nor the origin, in the Old World, of the coffee-tree, and\r\nof wheat. But there are certain objects of culture, of very ancient\r\ndate, between the tropics, such for example as the banana, of which the\r\norigin cannot be verified. Armies, in modern times, have been known to\r\ncarry, in all directions, grain and cultivated vegetables from one\r\nextremity of Europe to the other; and thus have shown us how, in more\r\nancient times, the conquests of Alexander, the distant expeditions of\r\nthe Romans, and afterwards the crusades, may have transported many\r\nplants from one part of the world to the other.\"[866]\r\n\r\nBut, besides the plants used in agriculture, the numbers which have been\r\nnaturalized by accident, or which man has spread unintentionally, is\r\nconsiderable. One of our old authors, Josselyn, gives a catalogue of\r\nsuch plants as had, in his time, sprung up in the colony since the\r\nEnglish planted and kept cattle in New England. They were two-and-twenty\r\nin number. The common nettle was the first which the settlers noticed;\r\nand the plantain was called by the Indians \"Englishman's foot,\" as if it\r\nsprung from their footsteps.[867]\r\n\r\n\"We have introduced every where,\" observes De Candolle, \"some weeds\r\nwhich grow among our various kinds of wheat, and which have been\r\nreceived, perhaps, originally from Asia along with them. Thus, together\r\nwith the Barbary wheat, the inhabitants of the south of Europe have\r\nsown, for many ages, the plants of Algiers and Tunis. With the wools and\r\ncottons of the East, or of Barbary, there are often brought into France\r\nthe grains of exotic plants, some of which naturalize themselves. Of\r\nthis I will cite a striking example. There is, at the gate of\r\nMontpellier, a meadow set apart for drying foreign wool, _after it has\r\nbeen washed_. There hardly passes a year without foreign plants being\r\nfound naturalized in this drying-ground. I have gathered there\r\n_Centaurea parviflora_, _Psoralea palaestina_, and _Hypericum crispum_.\"\r\nThis fact is not only illustrative of the aid which man lends\r\ninadvertently to the propagation of plants, but it also demonstrates the\r\nmultiplicity of seeds which are borne about in the woolly and hairy\r\ncoats of wild animals.\r\n\r\nThe same botanist mentions instances of plants naturalized in seaports\r\nby the ballast of ships; and several examples of others which have\r\nspread through Europe from botanical gardens, so as to have become more\r\ncommon than many indigenous species.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely a century, says Linnaeus, since the Canadian erigeron, or\r\nflea-bane, was brought from America to the botanical garden at Paris;\r\nand already the seeds have been carried by the winds so that it is\r\ndiffused over France, the British islands, Italy, Sicily, Holland, and\r\nGermany.[868] Several others are mentioned by the Swedish naturalist, as\r\nhaving been dispersed by similar means. The common thorn-apple (_Datura\r\nStramonium_), observes Willdenow, now grows as a noxious weed throughout\r\nall Europe, with the exception of Sweden, Lapland and Russia. It came\r\nfrom the East Indies and Abyssinia to us, and was thus universally\r\nspread by certain quacks, who used its seeds as an emetic.[869] The same\r\nplant is now abundant throughout the greater part of the United States,\r\nalong road-sides and about farm-yards. The yellow monkey-flower,\r\n_Mimulus luteus_, a plant from the north-west region of America, has now\r\nestablished itself in various parts of England, and is spreading\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nIn hot and ill-cultivated countries, such naturalization takes place\r\nmore easily. Thus the _Chenopodium ambrosioides_, sown by Mr. Burchell\r\non a point of St. Helena, multiplied so fast in four years as to become\r\none of the commonest weeds in the island, and it has maintained its\r\nground ever since 1845.[870]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable proof, says De Candolle, of the extent to which man\r\nis unconsciously the instrument of dispersing and naturalizing species,\r\nis found in the fact, that in New Holland, America, and the Cape of Good\r\nHope, the aboriginal European species exceed in number all the others\r\nwhich have come from any distant regions; so that, in this instance, the\r\ninfluence of man has surpassed that of all the other causes which tend\r\nto disseminate plants to remote districts. Of nearly 1600 British\r\nflowering plants, it is supposed that about 300 species are naturalized;\r\nbut a large proportion of these would perish with the discontinuance of\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are but slightly acquainted, as yet, with the extent of our\r\ninstrumentality in naturalizing species, yet the facts ascertained\r\nafford no small reason to suspect that the number which we introduce\r\nunintentionally exceeds all those transported by design. Nor is it\r\nunnatural to suppose that the functions, which the inferior beings,\r\nextirpated by man, once discharged in the economy of nature, should\r\ndevolve upon the human race. If we drive many birds of passage from\r\ndifferent countries, we are probably required to fulfil their office of\r\ncarrying seeds, eggs of fish, insects, mollusks, and other creatures, to\r\ndistant regions: if we extirpate quadrupeds, we must replace them not\r\nmerely as consumers of the animal and vegetable substances which they\r\ndevour, but as disseminators of plants, and of the inferior classes of\r\nthe animal kingdom. I do not mean to insinuate that the very same\r\nchanges which man brings about, would have taken place by means of the\r\nagency of other species, but merely that he supersedes a certain number\r\nof agents; and so far as he disperses plants unintentionally, or against\r\nhis will, his intervention is strictly analogous to that of the species\r\nso extirpated.\r\n\r\nI may observe, moreover, that if, at former periods, the animals\r\ninhabiting any given district have been partially altered by the\r\nextinction of some species, and the introduction of others, whether by\r\nnew creations or by immigration, a change must have taken place in\r\nregard to the particular plants conveyed about with them to foreign\r\ncountries. As, for example, when one set of migratory birds is\r\nsubstituted for another, the countries from and to which seeds are\r\ntransported are immediately changed. Vicissitudes, therefore, analogous\r\nto those which man has occasioned, may have previously attended the\r\nspringing up of new relations between species in the vegetable and\r\nanimal worlds.\r\n\r\nIt may also be remarked, that if man is the most active agent in\r\nenlarging, so also is he in circumscribing the geographical boundaries\r\nof particular plants. He promotes the migration of some, he retards that\r\nof other species; so that, while in many respects he appears to be\r\nexerting his power to blend and confound the various provinces of\r\nindigenous species, he is, in other ways, instrumental in obstructing\r\nthe fusion into one group of the inhabitants of contiguous provinces.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, when two botanical regions exist in the same great\r\ncontinent, such as _the European region_, comprehending the central\r\nparts of Europe, and those surrounding the Mediterranean, and _the\r\nOriental region_, as it has been termed, embracing the countries\r\nadjoining the Black Sea and the Caspian, the interposition between these\r\nof thousands of square miles of cultivated lands, opposes a new and\r\npowerful barrier against the mutual interchange of indigenous plants.\r\nBotanists are well aware that garden plants naturalize and diffuse\r\nthemselves with great facility in comparatively unreclaimed countries,\r\nbut spread themselves slowly and with difficulty in districts highly\r\ncultivated. There are many obvious causes for this difference; by\r\ndrainage and culture the natural variety of stations is diminished, and\r\nthose stray individuals by which the passage of a species from one fit\r\nstation to another is effected, are no sooner detected by the\r\nagriculturist, than they are uprooted as weeds. The larger shrubs and\r\ntrees, in particular, can scarcely ever escape observation, when they\r\nhave attained a certain size, and will rarely fail to be cut down if\r\nunprofitable.\r\n\r\nThe same observations are applicable to the interchange of the insects,\r\nbirds, and quadrupeds of two regions situated like those above alluded\r\nto. No beasts of prey are permitted to make their way across the\r\nintervening arable tracts. Many birds, and hundreds of insects, which\r\nwould have found some palatable food amongst the various herbs and trees\r\nof the primeval wilderness, are unable to subsist on the olive, the\r\nvine, the wheat, and a few trees and grasses favored by man. In\r\naddition, therefore, to his direct intervention, man, in this case,\r\noperates indirectly to impede the dissemination of plants, by\r\nintercepting the migration of animals, many of which would otherwise\r\nhave been active in transporting seeds from one province to another.\r\n\r\nWhether, in the vegetable kingdom, the influence of man will tend, after\r\na considerable lapse of ages, to render the geographical range of\r\n_species in general_ more extended, as De Candolle seems to anticipate,\r\nor whether the compensating agency above alluded to will not\r\ncounterbalance the exceptions caused by our naturalizations, admits at\r\nleast of some doubt. In the attempt to form an estimate on this subject,\r\nwe must be careful not to underrate, or almost overlook, as some appear\r\nto have done, the influence of man in checking the diffusion of plants,\r\nand restricting their distribution to narrower limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nLAWS WHICH REGULATE THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF\r\nSPECIES--_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Geographical distribution of animals--Buffon on specific\r\n    distinctness of quadrupeds of Old and New World--Doctrine of\r\n    \"natural barriers\"--Different regions of indigenous\r\n    mammalia--Europe--Africa--India, and Indian\r\n    Archipelago--Australia--North and South America--Quadrupeds in\r\n    islands--Range of the Cetacea--Dispersion of quadrupeds--Their\r\n    powers of swimming--Migratory instincts--Drifting of animals on\r\n    ice-floes--On floating islands of drift-timber--Migrations of\r\n    Cetacea--Habitations of birds--Their migrations and facilities of\r\n    diffusion--Distribution of reptiles, and their power of\r\n    dissemination.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geographical distribution of animals._--Although in speculating on\r\n\"philosophical possibilities,\" said Buffon, \"the same temperature might\r\nhave been expected, all other circumstances being equal, to produce the\r\nsame beings in different parts of the globe, both in the animal and\r\nvegetable kingdoms, yet it is an undoubted fact, that when America was\r\ndiscovered, its indigenous quadrupeds were all dissimilar to those\r\npreviously known in the Old World. The elephant, the rhinoceros, the\r\nhippopotamus, the camelopard, the camel, the dromedary, the buffalo, the\r\nhorse, the ass, the lion, the tiger, the apes, the baboons, and a number\r\nof other mammalia, were nowhere to be met with on the new continent;\r\nwhile in the old, the American species, of the same great class, were\r\nnowhere to be seen--the tapir, the lama, the pecari, the jaguar, the\r\ncouguar, the agouti, the paca, the coati, and the sloth.\"\r\n\r\nThese phenomena, although few in number relatively to the whole animate\r\ncreation, were so striking and so positive in their nature, that the\r\ngreat French naturalist caught sight at once of a general law in the\r\ngeographical distribution of organic beings, namely, the limitation of\r\ngroups of distinct species to regions separated from the rest of the\r\nglobe by certain natural barriers. It was, therefore, in a truly\r\nphilosophical spirit that, relying on the clearness of the evidence\r\nobtained respecting the larger quadrupeds, he ventured to call in\r\nquestion the identifications announced by some contemporary naturalists\r\nof species of animals said to be common to the southern extremities of\r\nAmerica and Africa.[871]\r\n\r\nThe migration of quadrupeds from one part of the globe to another,\r\nobserves Dr. Prichard, is prevented by uncongenial climates and the\r\nbranches of the ocean which intersect continents. \"Hence, by a\r\nreference to the geographical site of countries, we may divide the\r\nearth into a certain number of regions fitted to become the abodes of\r\nparticular groups of animals, and we shall find, on inquiry, that each\r\nof these provinces, thus conjecturally marked out, is actually inhabited\r\nby a distinct nation of quadrupeds.\"[872] It will be observed that the\r\nlanguage of Buffon respecting \"natural barriers,\" which has since been\r\nso popular, would be wholly without meaning if the geographical\r\ndistribution of organic beings had not led naturalists to adopt very\r\ngenerally _the doctrine of specific centres_, or, in other words, to\r\nbelieve that each species, whether of plant or animal, originated in a\r\nsingle birth-place. Reject this view, and the fact that not a single\r\nnative quadruped is common to Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, and\r\nSouth America, can in no ways be explained by adverting to the wide\r\nextent of intervening ocean, or to the sterile deserts, or the great\r\nheat or cold of the climates, through which each species must have\r\npassed, before it could migrate from one of those distant regions to\r\nanother. It might fairly be asked of one who talked of impassable\r\nbarriers, why the same kangaroos, rhinoceroses, or lamas, should not\r\nhave been created simultaneously in Australia, Africa, and South\r\nAmerica! The horse, the ox, and the dog, although foreign to these\r\ncountries until introduced by man, are now able to support themselves\r\nthere in a wild state, and we can scarcely doubt that many of the\r\nquadrupeds at present peculiar to Australia, Africa, and South America,\r\nmight have continued in like manner to inhabit each of the three\r\ncontinents had they been indigenous or could they once have got a\r\nfooting there as new colonists.\r\n\r\nAt the same time every zoologist will be willing to concede, that even\r\nif the departure of each species from a single centre had not appeared\r\nto be part of the plan of Nature, the range of species in general must\r\nhave become limited, under the influence of a variety of causes,\r\nespecially in the class of terrestrial mammalia. Scarcely any one of\r\nthese could be expected to retain as fair a claim to the title of\r\ncosmopolite as man, although even the human race, fitted as it is by its\r\nbodily constitution and intellectual resources to spread very widely\r\nover the earth, is far from being strictly cosmopolite. It is excluded\r\nboth from the arctic and antarctic circles, from many a wide desert and\r\nthe summits of many mountain-chains; and lastly, from three-fourths of\r\nthe globe covered by water, where there are large areas very prolific in\r\nanimal life, even in the highest order of the vertebrate class. But the\r\n_habitations_ of species are, as before stated, in reference to plants\r\n(see above, p. 614), circumscribed by causes different from those which\r\ndetermine their _stations_, and these causes are clearly connected with\r\nthe time and place of the original creation of each species.\r\n\r\nAs the names and characters of land quadrupeds are much better known to\r\nthe general reader than those of other great families of the animal\r\nkingdom, I shall select this class to exemplify the zoological provinces\r\ninto which species are divisible, confining myself, however, to those\r\nfacts which may help to elucidate some principle, or rule apparently\r\nfollowed by the Author of Nature, in regard to that \"mystery of\r\nmysteries,\" the first peopling of the earth with living beings.[873]\r\nFirst, then, the _European region_ comprehends, besides Europe, the\r\nborders of the Mediterranean, and even the north of Africa, and extends\r\ninto Asia, beyond the Oural mountains and the Caspian. Although the\r\nspecies are almost all peculiar, the number of characteristic _genera_\r\nis remarkably small. The bear, the fox, the hare, the rabbit, the deer,\r\nand almost every European form is found equally in several of the other\r\nlarge provinces of mammalia, where the species are distinct. Even the\r\nmole (_Talpa_), although confined to the northern parts of the old\r\nworld, ranges eastwards, as far as the Himalaya mountains.\r\n\r\n2dly. The _African_ Fauna, on the other hand, is singularly rich in\r\ngeneric forms, not met with in a living state in any other region. The\r\nhippopotamus, for example, of which two very distinct species are known,\r\nthe giraffe, the Chimpanzee, the blue-faced baboon, the four-fingered\r\nmonkeys (_Colubus_), many carnivora, such as _Proteles_, allied to the\r\nhyaena, and a multitude of other forms, are exclusively African. A few of\r\nthe species inhabiting the northern confines of this continent, such as\r\nthe dromedary, lion, and jackall, are also common to Asia; and a much\r\nlarger number of _forms_ belong equally to the great Asiatic province,\r\nthe species being distinct. The elephant, for example, of Africa is\r\nsmaller, has a rounder head, and larger ears than the Indian one, and\r\nhas only three instead of four nails on each hind foot. In like manner,\r\nnot one of three African species of Rhinoceros agrees with one of the\r\nthree Indian kinds.\r\n\r\n3dly. The _Southern_ region of _Africa_, where that continent extends\r\ninto the temperate zone, constitutes another separate zoological\r\nprovince, surrounded as it is on three sides by the ocean, and cut off\r\nfrom the countries of milder climate in the northern hemisphere, by the\r\nintervening torrid zone. In many instances, this region contains the\r\nsame genera which are found in temperate climates to the northward of\r\nthe line: but then the southern are different from the northern species.\r\nThus, in the south we find the quagga and the zebra; in the north, the\r\nhorse, the ass, and the jiggetai of Asia.\r\n\r\nThe south of Africa is spread out into fine level plains from the tropic\r\nto the Cape. In this region, says Pennant, besides the horse genus, of\r\nwhich five species have been found, there are also peculiar species of\r\nrhinoceros, the hog, and the hyrax, among pachydermatous races; and\r\namongst the ruminating, the Cape buffalo, and a variety of remarkable\r\nantelopes, as the springbok, the oryx, the gnou, the leucophoa, the\r\npygarga, and several others.[874]\r\n\r\n4thly. The assemblage of quadrupeds in _Madagascar_ affords a striking\r\nillustration of the laws before alluded to, as governing the\r\ndistribution of species in islands. Separated from Africa by the\r\nMozambique channel, which is 300 miles wide, Madagascar forms, with two\r\nor three small islands in its immediate vicinity, a zoological province\r\nby itself, all the species except one, and nearly all the genera, being\r\npeculiar. The only exception consists of a small insectivorous quadruped\r\n(_Centetes_), found also in the Mauritius, to which place it is supposed\r\nto have been taken in ships. The most characteristic feature of this\r\nremarkable fauna consists in the number of quadrumana of the Lemur\r\nfamily, no less than six genera of these monkeys being exclusively met\r\nwith in this island, and a seventh genus of the same, called _Galago_,\r\nwhich alone has any foreign representative, being found, as we might\r\nfrom analogy have anticipated, in the nearest main land. Had the species\r\nof quadrupeds in Madagascar agreed with those of the contiguous parts of\r\nAfrica, as do those of England with the rest of Europe, the naturalist\r\nwould have inferred that there had been a land communication since the\r\nperiod of the coming in of the existing quadrupeds, whereas we may now\r\nconclude that the Mozambique channel has constituted an insuperable\r\nbarrier to the fusion of the continental fauna with that of the great\r\nisland during the whole period that has elapsed since the living species\r\nwere created.\r\n\r\n5thly. Another of the great nations of terrestrial mammalia is that of\r\n_India_, containing a great variety of peculiar forms, such as the\r\nsloth-bear (_Prochilus_), the musk-deer (_Moscus_), the nylghau, the\r\ngibbon or long-armed ape, and many others.\r\n\r\n6thly. A portion of the islands of the _Indian archipelago_ might,\r\nperhaps, be considered by some geologists as an appendage of the same\r\nprovince. In fact, we find in the large islands of Java, Sumatra, and\r\nBorneo, the same genera, for the most part, as on the continent of\r\nIndia, and some of the same species, _e. g._ the tapir (_Tapirus\r\nMalayanus_), the rhinoceros of Sumatra, and some others. Most of the\r\nspecies, however, are distinct, and each island has many, and even a few\r\ngenera, peculiar to itself. Between eighty and ninety species are known\r\nto inhabit Java, and nearly the same number occur in Sumatra. Of these,\r\nmore than half are common to the two islands. Borneo, which is much less\r\nexplored, has yielded already upwards of sixty species, more than half\r\nof which are met with either in Java or Sumatra. Of the species\r\ninhabiting Sumatra and not found in Java, Borneo contains the greater\r\nportion. Upon the whole, if these three large islands were united, and a\r\nfusion of their respective indigenous mammalia should take place, they\r\nwould present a fauna related to that of continental India, and\r\ncomprising about as many species as we might expect from analogy to\r\ndiscover in an area of equal extent. The Philippine Islands are peopled\r\nwith another assemblage of species generically related to the great\r\nIndian type.\r\n\r\n7thly. But the islands of Celebes, Amboina, Timor, and _New Guinea_,\r\nconstitute a different region of mammalia more allied to the Australian\r\ntype, as having an intermixture of marsupial quadrupeds, yet showing an\r\naffinity also to the Indian in such forms as the deer (_Cervus_), the\r\nweasel (_Viverra_), the pig (_Sus_), the Macaque monkey\r\n(_Cercopithecus_), and others. As we proceed in a south-westerly\r\ndirection, from Celebes to Amboina and thence to New Guinea, we find the\r\nIndian types diminishing in number, and the Australian (_i. e._\r\nmarsupial forms) increasing. Thus in New Guinea seven species of pouched\r\nquadrupeds have been detected, and among them two singular\r\ntree-kangaroos; yet only one species of the whole seven, viz. the flying\r\nopossum (_Petauris ariel_), is common to the Indian archipelago and the\r\nmain land of Australia. The greater the zoological affinity, therefore,\r\nbetween the latter and the New Guinea fauna, although it seems in some\r\nway connected with geographical proximity, is not to be explained simply\r\nby the mutual migration of species from the one to the other.\r\n\r\n8thly. When _Australia_ was discovered, its land quadrupeds, belonging\r\nalmost exclusively to the marsupial or pouched tribe, such as the\r\nkangaroos, wombats, flying opossums, kangaroo-rats, and others, some\r\nfeeding on herbs and fruits, others carnivorous, were so novel in their\r\nstructure and aspect, that they appeared to the naturalist almost as\r\nstrange as if they were the inhabitants of some other planet. We learn\r\nfrom the recent investigations of Mr. Waterhouse,[875] that no less than\r\n170 species of marsupial quadrupeds have now been determined, and of the\r\nwhole number all but thirty-two are exclusively restricted to Australia.\r\nOf these thirty-two, nine belong to the islands in the Indian\r\narchipelago before mentioned, and the other twenty-three are all species\r\nof opossum inhabiting the tropical parts of South America, or a few of\r\nthem extending into Mexico and California, and one, the Virginian\r\nopossum, into the United States.\r\n\r\n9thly. It only remains for me to say something of the mammiferous fauna\r\nof _North_ and _South America_. It has often been said that, where the\r\nthree continents of Asia, Europe, and North America, approach very near\r\nto each other towards the pole, the whole arctic region forms one\r\nzoological and botanical province. The narrow straits which separate the\r\nold and new world are frozen over in winter, and the distance is farther\r\nlessened by intervening islands. Many plants and animals of various\r\nclasses have accordingly spread over all the arctic lands, being\r\nsometimes carried in the same manner as the polar bear, when it is\r\ndrifted on floating ice from Greenland to Iceland. But on a close\r\ninspection of the arctic mammalia, it has been found of late years that\r\na very small number of the American species are identical with those of\r\nEurope or Asia. The genera are, in great part, the same or nearly\r\nallied; but the species are rarely identical, and are often very unlike,\r\nas in the case of the American badger and that of Europe. Some of the\r\n_genera_ of arctic America, such as the musk ox (_Ovibos_), are quite\r\npeculiar, and the distinctness of the fauna of the great continents goes\r\non increasing in proportion as we trace them southwards, or as they\r\nrecede farther from each other, and become more and more separated by\r\nthe ocean. At length we find that the three groups of tropical mammalia,\r\nbelonging severally to America, Africa, and India, have not a single\r\nspecies in common.\r\n\r\nThe predominant influence of climate over all the other causes which\r\nlimit the range of species in the mammalia is perhaps nowhere so\r\nconspicuously displayed as in North America. The arctic fauna, so\r\nadmirably described by Sir John Richardson, has scarcely any species in\r\ncommon with the fauna of the state of New York, which is 600 miles\r\nfarther south, and comprises about forty distinct mammifers. If again we\r\ntravel farther south about 600 miles, and enter another zone, running\r\neast and west, in South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and the contiguous\r\nstates, we again meet with a new assemblage of land quadrupeds, and this\r\nagain differs from the fauna of Texas, where frosts are unknown. It will\r\nbe observed that on this continent there are no great geographical\r\nbarriers running east and west, such as high snow-clad mountains, barren\r\ndeserts, or wide arms of the sea, capable of checking the free migration\r\nof species from north to south. But notwithstanding the distinctness of\r\nthose zones of indigenous mammalia, there are some species, such as the\r\nbuffalo (_Bison Americanus_), the racoon (_Procyon lotor_), and the\r\nVirginian opossum (_Didelphis Virginiana_), which have a wider\r\nhabitation, ranging almost from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico; but they\r\nform exceptions to the general rule. The opossum of Texas (_Didelphis\r\ncarnivora_) is different from that of Virginia, and other species of the\r\nsame genus inhabit westward of the Rocky Mountains, in California, for\r\nexample, where almost all the mammalia differ from those of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n10thly. The _West Indian_ land quadrupeds are not numerous, but several\r\nof them are peculiar; and 11thly, _South America_ is the most distinct,\r\nwith the exception of Australia, of all the provinces into which the\r\nmammalia can be classed geographically. The various genera of monkeys,\r\nfor example, belong to the family Platyrrhini, a large natural division\r\nof the quadrumana, so named from their widely separated nostrils. They\r\nhave a peculiar dentition, and many of them prehensile tails, and are\r\nentirely unknown in other quarters of the globe. The sloths and\r\narmadillos, the true blood-sucking bats or vampyres (_Phyllostomidae_),\r\nthe capybara, the largest of the rodents, the carnivorous coatimondi\r\n(_Nasua_), and a great many other forms, are also exclusively\r\ncharacteristic of South America.\r\n\r\n\"In Peru and Chili,\" says Humboldt, \"the region of the grasses, which is\r\nat an elevation of from 12,300 to 15,400 feet, is inhabited by crowds\r\nof lama, guanaco, and alpaca. These quadrupeds, which here represent the\r\ngenus camel of the ancient continent, have not extended themselves\r\neither to Brazil or Mexico; because, during their journey, they must\r\nnecessarily have descended into regions that were too hot for\r\nthem.\"[876] In this passage it will be seen that the doctrine of\r\n\"specific centres\" is tacitly assumed.\r\n\r\n_Quadrupeds in Islands._--Islands remote from continents, especially\r\nthose of small size, are either destitute of quadrupeds, except such as\r\nhave been conveyed to them by man, or contain species peculiar to them.\r\nIn the Galapagos archipelago no indigenous quadrupeds were found except\r\none mouse, which is supposed to be distinct from any hitherto found\r\nelsewhere. A peculiar species of fox is indigenous in the Falkland\r\nIslands, and a rat in New Zealand, which last country, notwithstanding\r\nits magnitude, is destitute of other mammalia, except bats, and these,\r\nsays Dr. Prichard, may have made their way along the chain of islands\r\nwhich extend from the shores of New Guinea far into the Southern\r\nPacific. The same author remarks, that among the various groups of\r\nfertile islands in the Pacific, no quadrupeds have been met with except\r\nthe rat and a few bats as above mentioned, and the dog and hog, which\r\nappear to have been conveyed thither by the natives from New Guinea.\r\n\"Rats are to be found even on some desert islands, whither they may have\r\nbeen conveyed by canoes which have occasionally approached the shore. It\r\nis known, also, that rats occasionally swim in large numbers to\r\nconsiderable distances.\"[877]\r\n\r\n_Geographical range of the Cetacea._--It is natural to suppose that the\r\ngeographical range of the different species of Cetacea should be less\r\ncorrectly ascertained than that of the terrestrial mammifers. It is,\r\nhowever, well known that the whales which are obtained by our fishers in\r\nthe South Seas are distinct from those of the North; and the same\r\ndissimilarity has been found in all the other marine animals, of the\r\nsame class, so far as they have yet been studied by naturalists.\r\n\r\n_Dispersion of quadrupeds._--Let us now inquire what facilities the\r\nvarious land quadrupeds enjoy of spreading themselves over the surface\r\nof the earth. In the first place, as their numbers multiply, all of\r\nthem, whether they feed on plants, or prey on other animals, are\r\ndisposed to scatter themselves gradually over as wide an area as is\r\naccessible to them. But before they have extended their migrations over\r\na large space, they are usually arrested either by the sea, or a zone of\r\nuncongenial climate, or some lofty and unbroken chain of mountains, or a\r\ntract already occupied by a hostile and more powerful species.\r\n\r\n_Their powers of swimming._--Rivers and narrow friths can seldom\r\ninterfere with their progress; for the greater part of them swim well,\r\nand few are without this power when urged by danger and pressing want.\r\nThus, amongst beasts of prey, the tiger is seen swimming about among\r\nthe islands and creeks in the delta of the Ganges, and the jaguar\r\ntraverses with ease the largest streams in South America.[878] The bear,\r\nalso, and the bison, cross the current of the Mississippi. The popular\r\nerror, that the common swine cannot escape by swimming when thrown into\r\nthe water, has been contradicted by several curious and\r\nwell-authenticated instances during the floods in Scotland of 1829. One\r\npig, only six months old, after having been carried down from Garmouth\r\nto the bar at the mouth of the Spey, a distance of a quarter of a mile,\r\nswam four miles eastward to Port Gordon, and landed safe. Three others,\r\nof the same age and litter, swam, at the same time, five miles to the\r\nwest, and landed at Blackhill.[879]\r\n\r\nIn an adult and wild state, these animals would doubtless have been more\r\nstrong and active, and might, when hard pressed, have performed a much\r\nlonger voyage. Hence islands remote from the continent may obtain\r\ninhabitants by casualties which, like the late storms in Morayshire, may\r\nonly occur once in many centuries, or thousands of years, under all the\r\nsame circumstances. It is obvious that powerful tides, winds, and\r\ncurrents may sometimes carry along quadrupeds capable, in like manner,\r\nof preserving themselves for hours in the sea, to very considerable\r\ndistances; and in this way, perhaps, the tapir (_Tapir Indicus_) may\r\nhave become common to Sumatra and the Malayan peninsula.\r\n\r\nTo the elephant, in particular, the power of crossing rivers is\r\nessential in a wild state, for the quantity of food which a herd of\r\nthese animals consumes renders it necessary that they should be\r\nconstantly moving from place to place. The elephant crosses the stream\r\nin two ways. If the bed of the river be hard, and the water not of too\r\ngreat a depth, he fords it. But when he crosses great rivers, such as\r\nthe Ganges and the Niger, the elephant swims deep, so deep, that the end\r\nof his trunk only is out of the water; for it is a matter of\r\nindifference to him whether his body be completely immersed, provided he\r\ncan bring the tip of his trunk to the surface, so as to breathe the\r\nexternal air.\r\n\r\nAnimals of the deer kind frequently take to the water, especially in the\r\nrutting season, when the stags are seen, swimming for several leagues at\r\na time, from island to island, in search of the does, especially in the\r\nCanadian lakes; and in some countries where there are islands near the\r\nsea-shore, they fearlessly enter the sea and swim to them. In hunting\r\nexcursions, in North America, the elk of that country is frequently\r\npursued for great distances through the water.\r\n\r\nThe large herbivorous animals, which are gregarious, can never remain\r\nlong in a confined region, as they consume so much vegetable food. The\r\nimmense herds of bisons (_Bos Americanus_) which often, in the great\r\nvalleys of the Mississippi and its tributaries blacken the surface of\r\nthe prairie lands, are continually shifting their quarters, followed by\r\nwolves, which prowl about in their rear. \"It is no exaggeration,\" says\r\nMr. James, \"to assert, that in one place, on the banks of the Platte, at\r\nleast ten thousand bisons burst on our sight in an instant. In the\r\nmorning, we again sought the living picture; but upon all the plain,\r\nwhich last evening was so teeming with noble animals, not one\r\nremained.\"[880]\r\n\r\n_Migratory instincts._--Besides the disposition common to the\r\nindividuals of every species slowly to extend their range in search of\r\nfood, in proportion as their numbers augment, a migratory instinct often\r\ndevelopes itself in an extraordinary manner, when, after an unusually\r\nprolific season, or upon a sudden scarcity of provisions, great\r\nmultitudes are threatened by famine. It may be useful to enumerate some\r\nexamples of these migrations, because they may put us upon our guard\r\nagainst attributing a high antiquity to a particular species merely\r\nbecause it is diffused over a great space; they show clearly how soon,\r\nin a state of nature, a newly created species might spread itself, in\r\nevery direction, from a single point.\r\n\r\nIn very severe winters, great numbers of the black bears of America\r\nmigrate from Canada into the United States; but in milder seasons, when\r\nthey have been well fed, they remain and hybernate in the north.[881]\r\nThe rein-deer, which, in Scandinavia, can scarcely exist to the south of\r\nthe sixty-fifth parallel, descends, in consequence of the greater\r\ncoldness of the climate, to the fiftieth degree in Chinese Tartary, and\r\noften roves into a country of more southern latitude than any part of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn Lapland, and other high latitudes, the common squirrels, whenever\r\nthey are compelled, by want of provisions, to quit their usual abodes,\r\nmigrate in amazing numbers, and travel directly forwards, allowing\r\nneither rocks nor forests, nor the broadest waters, to turn them from\r\ntheir course. Great numbers are often drowned in attempting to pass\r\nfriths and rivers. In like manner the small Norway rat sometimes pursues\r\nits migrations in a straight line across rivers and lakes; and Pennant\r\ninforms us, that when the rats, in Kamtschatka, become too numerous,\r\nthey gather together in the spring, and proceed in great bodies\r\nwestward, swimming over rivers, lakes, and arms of the sea. Many are\r\ndrowned or destroyed by water-fowl or fish. As soon as they have crossed\r\nthe river Penginsk, at the head of the gulf of the same name, they turn\r\nsouthward, and reach the rivers Judoma and Okotsk by the middle of July;\r\na district more than 800 miles distant from their point of departure.\r\n\r\nThe lemings, also, a small kind of rat, are described as natives of the\r\nmountains of Kolen, in Lapland; and once or twice in a quarter of a\r\ncentury they appear in vast numbers, advancing along the ground, and\r\n\"devouring every green thing.\" Innumerable bands march from the Kolen,\r\nthrough Nordland and Finmark, to the Western Ocean, which they\r\nimmediately enter; and after swimming about for some time, perish. Other\r\nbands take their route through Swedish Lapland, to the Bothnian Gulf,\r\nwhere they are drowned in the same manner. They are followed in their\r\njourneys by bears, wolves, and foxes, which prey upon them incessantly.\r\nThey generally move in lines, which are about three feet from each\r\nother, and exactly parallel, going directly forward through rivers and\r\nlakes; and when they meet with stacks of hay or corn, gnawing their way\r\nthrough them instead of passing round.[882] These excursions usually\r\nprecede a rigorous winter, of which the lemings seem in some way\r\nforewarned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.\r\n\r\nThe Leming, or Lapland Marmot (Mus Lemmus, Linn.)]\r\n\r\nVast troops of the wild ass, or _onager_ of the ancients, which inhabit\r\nthe mountainous deserts of Great Tartary, feed, during the summer, in\r\nthe tracts east and north of Lake Aral. In the autumn they collect in\r\nherds of hundreds, and even thousands, and direct their course towards\r\nPersia, to enjoy a warm retreat during winter.[883] Bands of two or\r\nthree hundred quaggas, a species of wild ass, are sometimes seen to\r\nmigrate from the tropical plains of southern Africa to the vicinity of\r\nthe Malaleveen River. During their migrations they are followed by\r\nlions, who slaughter them night by night.[884]\r\n\r\nThe migratory swarms of the springbok, or Cape antelope, afford another\r\nillustration of the rapidity with which a species under certain\r\ncircumstances may be diffused over a continent. When the stagnant pools\r\nof the immense deserts south of the Orange River dry up, which often\r\nhappens after intervals of three or four years, myriads of these animals\r\ndesert the parched soil, and pour down like a deluge on the cultivated\r\nregions near the Cape. The havoc committed by them resembles that of the\r\nAfrican locusts; and so crowded are the herds, that \"the lion has been\r\nseen to walk in the midst of the compressed phalanx with only as much\r\nroom between him and his victims as the fears of those immediately\r\naround could procure by pressing outwards.\"[885]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.\r\n\r\nMydaus meliceps, or badger-headed Mydaus. Length, including the tail, 16\r\ninches.]\r\n\r\nDr. Horsfield mentions a singular fact in regard to the geographical\r\ndistribution of the _Mydaus meliceps_, an animal intermediate between\r\nthe polecat and badger. It inhabits Java, and is \"confined exclusively\r\nto those mountains which have an elevation of more than seven thousand\r\nfeet above the level of the ocean; on these it occurs with the same\r\nregularity as many plants. The long extended surface of Java, abounding\r\nwith conical points which exceed this elevation, affords many places\r\nfavorable for its resort. On ascending these mountains, the traveller\r\nscarcely fails to meet with this animal, which, from its peculiarities,\r\nis universally known to the inhabitants of these elevated tracts, while\r\nto those of the plains it is as strange to an animal from a foreign\r\ncounty. In my visits to the mountainous districts, I uniformly met with\r\nit; and, as far as the information of the natives can be relied on, it\r\nis found on all the mountains.\"[886]\r\n\r\nNow, if asked to conjecture how the Mydaus arrived at the elevated\r\nregions of each of these isolated mountains, we might say that, before\r\nthe island was peopled by man, by whom their numbers are now thinned,\r\nthey may occasionally have multiplied so as to be forced to collect\r\ntogether and migrate: in which case notwithstanding the slowness of\r\ntheir motions, some few would succeed in reaching another mountain, some\r\ntwenty, or even, perhaps, fifty miles distant; for although the climate\r\nof the hot intervening plains would be unfavourable to them, they might\r\nsupport it for a time, and would find there abundance of insects on\r\nwhich they feed. Volcanic eruptions, which, at different times have\r\ncovered the summits of some of those lofty cones with sterile sand and\r\nashes, may have occasionally contributed to force on these migrations.\r\n\r\n_Drifting of animals on ice-floes._--The power of the terrestrial\r\nmammalia to cross the sea is very limited, and it was before stated that\r\nthe same species is scarcely ever common to districts widely separated\r\nby the ocean. If there be some exceptions to this rule, they generally\r\nadmit of explanation; for there are natural means whereby some animals\r\nmay be floated across the water, and the sea may in the course of ages\r\nwear a wide passage through a neck of land, leaving individuals of a\r\nspecies on each side of the new channel. Polar bears are known to have\r\nbeen frequently drifted on the ice from Greenland to Iceland; they can\r\nalso swim to considerable distances, for Captain Parry, on the return of\r\nhis ships through Barrow's Straits, met with a bear swimming in the\r\nwater about midway between the shores, which were about forty miles\r\napart, and where no ice was in sight.[887] \"Near the east coast of\r\nGreenland,\" observes Scoresby, \"they have been seen on the ice in such\r\nquantities, that they were compared to flocks of sheep on a common; and\r\nthey are often found on field-ice, above two hundred miles from the\r\nshore.\"[888] Wolves, in the arctic regions, often venture upon the ice\r\nnear the shore, for the purpose of preying upon young seals which they\r\nsurprise when asleep. When these ice-floes get detached, the wolves are\r\noften carried out to sea; and though some may be drifted to islands or\r\ncontinents, the greater part of them perish, and have been often heard\r\nin this situation howling dreadfully, as they die by famine.[889]\r\n\r\nDuring the short summer which visits Melville Island, various plants\r\npush forth their leaves and flowers the moment the snow is off the\r\nground, and form a carpet spangled with the most lively colours. These\r\nsecluded spots are reached annually by herds of musk-oxen and reindeer,\r\nwhich travel immense distances over dreary and desolate regions, to\r\ngraze undisturbed on these luxuriant pastures.[890] The rein-deer often\r\npass along in the same manner, by the chain of the Aleutian Islands,\r\nfrom Behring's Straits to Kamtschatka, subsisting on the moss found in\r\nthese islands during their passage.[891] But the musk-ox,\r\nnotwithstanding its migratory habits, and its long journeys over the\r\nice, does not exist, either in Asia or Greenland.[892]\r\n\r\n_On floating islands of drift-wood._--Within the tropics there are no\r\nice-floes; but, as if to compensate for that mode of transportation,\r\nthere are floating islets of matted trees, which are often borne along\r\nthrough considerable spaces. These are sometimes seen sailing at the\r\ndistance of fifty or one hundred miles from the mouth of the Ganges,\r\nwith living trees standing erect upon them. The Amazon, the Congo, and\r\nthe Orinoco, also produce these verdant rafts, which are formed in the\r\nmanner already described when speaking of the great raft of the\r\nAtchafalaya, an arm of the Mississippi, where a natural bridge of\r\ntimber, ten miles long, and more than two hundred yards wide, existed\r\nfor more than forty years, supporting a luxuriant vegetation, and rising\r\nand sinking with the water which flowed beneath it.\r\n\r\nOn these green islets of the Mississippi, observes Malte-Brun, young\r\ntrees take root, and the pistia and nenuphar display their yellow\r\nflowers: serpents, birds, and the cayman alligator, come to repose\r\nthere, and all are sometimes carried to the sea and engulphed in its\r\nwaters.[893]\r\n\r\nSpix and Martius relate that, during their travels in Brazil, they were\r\nexposed to great danger while ascending the Amazon in a canoe, from the\r\nvast quantity of drift-wood constantly propelled against them by the\r\ncurrent; so much so, that their safety depended on the crew being always\r\non the alert to turn aside the trunks of trees with long poles. The tops\r\nalone of some trees appeared above water, others had their roots\r\nattached to them with so much soil that they might be compared to\r\nfloating islets. On these, say the travellers, we saw some very singular\r\nassemblages of animals, pursuing peacefully their uncertain way in\r\nstrange companionship. On one raft were several grave-looking storks,\r\nperched by the side of a party of monkeys, who made comical gestures,\r\nand burst into loud cries, on seeing the canoe. On another was seen a\r\nnumber of ducks and divers, sitting by a group of squirrels. Next came\r\ndown upon the stem of a large rotten cedar tree, an enormous crocodile,\r\nby the side of a tiger-cat, both animals regarding each other with\r\nhostility and mistrust, but the saurian being evidently most at his\r\nease, as conscious of his superior strength.[894]\r\n\r\nSimilar green rafts, principally composed of canes and brushwood, are\r\ncalled \"camelotes\" on the Parana in South America; and they are\r\noccasionally carried down by inundations, bearing on them the tiger,\r\ncayman, squirrels, and other quadrupeds, which are said to be always\r\nterror-stricken on their floating habitation. No less than four tigers\r\n(pumas) were landed in this manner in one night at Monte Video, lat. 35\r\ndegrees S., to the great alarm of the inhabitants, who found them\r\nprowling about the streets in the morning.[895]\r\n\r\nIn a memoir lately published, a naval officer relates that, as he\r\nreturned from China by the eastern passage, he fell in, among the\r\nMoluccas, with several small floating islands of this kind, covered with\r\nmangrove trees interwoven with underwood. The trees and shrubs retained\r\ntheir verdure, receiving nourishment from a stratum of soil which formed\r\na white beach round the margin of each raft, where it was exposed to the\r\nwashing of the waves and the rays of the sun.[896] The occurrence of\r\nsoil in such situations may easily be explained; for all the natural\r\nbridges of timber which occasionally connect the islands of the Ganges,\r\nMississippi, and other rivers, with their banks, are exposed to floods\r\nof water, densely charged with sediment.\r\n\r\nCaptain W. H. Smyth informs me, that, when cruising in the Cornwallis\r\namidst the Philippine Islands, he has more than once seen, after those\r\ndreadful hurricanes called typhoons, floating masses of wood, with\r\ntrees growing upon them, and ships have sometimes been in imminent\r\nperil, as often as these islands were mistaken for terra firma, when, in\r\nfact, they were in rapid motion.\r\n\r\nIt is highly interesting to trace, in imagination, the effects of the\r\npassage of these rafts from the mouth of a large river to some\r\narchipelago, such as those in the South Pacific, raised from the deep,\r\nin comparatively modern times, by the operations of the volcano and the\r\nearthquake, and the joint labours of coral animals and testacea. If a\r\nstorm arise, and the frail vessel be wrecked, still many a bird and\r\ninsect may succeed in gaining, by flight, some island of the newly\r\nformed group, while the seeds and berries of herbs and shrubs, which\r\nfall into the waves, may be thrown upon the strand. But if the surface\r\nof the deep be calm, and the rafts are carried along by a current, or\r\nwafted by some slight breath of air fanning the foliage of the green\r\ntrees, it may arrive, after a passage of several weeks, at the bay of an\r\nisland, into which its plants and animals may be poured out as from an\r\nark, and thus a colony of several hundred new species may at once be\r\nnaturalized.\r\n\r\nThe reader should be reminded, that I merely advert to the\r\ntransportation of these rafts as of extremely rare and accidental\r\noccurrence; but it may account, in tropical countries, for some of the\r\nrare exceptions to the general law of the confined range of mammiferous\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n_Migrations of the Cetacea._--Many of the Cetacea, the whales of the\r\nnorthern seas for example, are found to desert one tract of the sea, and\r\nto visit another very distant, when they are urged by want of food, or\r\ndanger. The seals also retire from the coast of Greenland in July,\r\nreturn again in September, and depart again in March, to return in June.\r\nThey proceed in great droves northwards, directing their course where\r\nthe sea is most free from ice, and are observed to be extremely fat when\r\nthey set out on this expedition, and very lean when they come home\r\nagain.[897]\r\n\r\n_Species of the Mediterranean, Black Sea, and Caspian identical._--Some\r\nnaturalists have wondered that the sea-calves, dolphins, and other\r\nmarine mammalia of the Mediterranean and Black Sea, should be identical\r\nwith those found in the Caspian: and among other fanciful theories, they\r\nhave suggested that they may dive through subterranean conduits, and\r\nthus pass from one sea into the other. But as the occurrence of wolves\r\nand other noxious animals, on both sides of the British Channel, was\r\nadduced, by Verstegan and Desmarest, as one of many arguments to prove\r\nthat England and France were once united; so the correspondence of the\r\naquatic species of the inland seas of Asia with those of the Black Sea\r\ntend to confirm the hypothesis, for which there are abundance of\r\nindependent geological data, that those seas were connected together by\r\nstraits at no remote period of the earth's history.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution and Migrations of Birds._\r\n\r\nI shall now offer a few observations on some of the other divisions of\r\nthe animal kingdom. Birds, notwithstanding their great locomotive\r\npowers, form no exception to the general rules already laid down; but,\r\nin this class, as in plants and terrestrial quadrupeds, different groups\r\nof species are circumscribed within definite limits. We find, for\r\nexample, one assemblage in the Brazils, another in the same latitudes in\r\nCentral Africa, another in India, and a fourth in New Holland. Of\r\ntwenty-six different species of land birds found in the Galapagos\r\narchipelago, all, with the exception of one, are distinct from those\r\ninhabiting other parts of the globe;[898] and in other archipelagos a\r\nsingle island sometimes contains a species found in no other spot on the\r\nwhole earth; as is exemplified in some of the parrot tribes. In this\r\nextensive family, which are, with few exceptions, inhabitants of\r\ntropical regions, the American group has not one in common with the\r\nAfrican, nor either of these with the parrots of India.[899]\r\n\r\nAnother illustration is afforded by that minute and beautiful tribe, the\r\nhumming-birds. The whole of them are, in the first place, peculiar to\r\nthe new world; but some species are confined to Mexico, while others\r\nexist only in some of the West India Islands, and have not been found\r\nelsewhere in the western hemisphere. Yet there are species of this\r\nfamily which have a vast range, as the _Trochilus flammifrons_ (or\r\n_Mellisuga Kingii_), which is found over a space of 2500 miles on the\r\nwest coast of South America, from the hot dry country of Lima to the\r\nhumid forests of Tierra del Fuego. Captain King, during his survey in\r\nthe years 1826-30, found this bird at the Straits of Magellan, in the\r\nmonth of May--the depth of winter--sucking the flowers of a large\r\nspecies of fuchsia, then in bloom, in the midst of a shower of snow.\r\n\r\nThe ornithology of our own country affords one well-known and striking\r\nexemplification of the law of a limited specific range; for the common\r\ngrouse (_Tetra scoticus_) occurs nowhere in the known world except in\r\nthe British isles.\r\n\r\nSome species of the vulture tribe are said to be cosmopolites; and the\r\ncommon wild goose (_Anas anser_, Linn.), if we may believe some\r\nornithologists, is a general inhabitant of the globe, being met with\r\nfrom Lapland to the Cape of Good Hope, frequent in Arabia, Persia,\r\nChina, and Japan, and in the American continent from Hudson's Bay to\r\nSouth Carolina.[900] An extraordinary range has also been attributed to\r\nthe nightingale, which extends from western Europe to Persia, and still\r\nfarther. In a work entitled Specchio Comparativo,[901] by Charles\r\nBonaparte, many species of birds are enumerated as common to Rome and\r\nPhiladelphia: the greater part of these are migratory, but some of them,\r\nsuch as the long-eared owl (_Strix otus_), are permanent in both\r\ncountries. The correspondence of the ornithological fauna of the eastern\r\nand western hemispheres increases considerably, as might have been\r\nanticipated, in high northern latitudes.[902]\r\n\r\n_Their facilities of diffusion._--In parallel zones of the northern and\r\nsouthern hemispheres, a great general correspondence of form is\r\nobservable, both in the aquatic and terrestrial birds; but there is\r\nrarely any specific identity; and this phenomenon is truly remarkable,\r\nwhen we recollect the readiness with which some birds, not gifted with\r\ngreat powers of flight, shift their quarters to different regions, and\r\nthe facility with which others, possessing great strength of wing,\r\nperform their aarial voyage. Some migrate periodically from high\r\nlatitudes, to avoid the cold of winter, and the accompaniments of\r\ncold,--scarcity of insects and vegetable food; others, it is said, for\r\nsome particular kinds of nutriment required for rearing their young: for\r\nthis purpose they often traverse the ocean for thousands of miles, and\r\nrecross it at other periods, with equal security.\r\n\r\nPeriodical migrations, no less regular, are mentioned by Humboldt, of\r\nmany American water-fowl, from one part of the tropics to another, in a\r\nzone where there is the same temperature throughout the year. Immense\r\nflights of ducks leave the valley of the Orinoco, when the increasing\r\ndepth of its waters and the flooding of its shores prevent them from\r\ncatching fish, insects, and aquatic worms. They then betake themselves\r\nto the Rio Negro and Amazon, having passed from the eighth and third\r\ndegrees of north latitude to the first and fourth of south latitude,\r\ndirecting their course south-south-east. In September, when the Orinoco\r\ndecreases and re-enters its channel, these birds return\r\nnorthwards.[903]\r\n\r\nThe insectivorous swallows which visit our island would perish during\r\nwinter, if they did not annually repair to warmer climes. It is supposed\r\nthat in these aerial excursions the average rapidity of their flight is\r\nnot less than fifty miles an hour; so that, when aided by the wind, they\r\nsoon reach warmer latitudes. Spallanzani calculated that the swallow can\r\nfly at the rate of ninety-two miles an hour, and conceived that the\r\nrapidity of the swift might be three times greater.[904] The rate of\r\nflight of the eider duck (_Anas mollissima_) is said to be ninety miles\r\nan hour; and Bachman says that the hawk, wild pigeon (_Columba\r\nmigratoria_), and several species of wild ducks, in North America, fly\r\nat the rate of forty miles an hour, or nearly a thousand miles in\r\ntwenty-four hours.[905]\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect how easily different species, in a great lapse of ages,\r\nmay be each overtaken by gales and hurricanes, and, abandoning\r\nthemselves to the tempest, be scattered at random through various\r\nregions of the earth's surface, where the temperature of the atmosphere,\r\nthe vegetation, and the animal productions, might be suited to their\r\nwants, we shall be prepared to find some species capriciously\r\ndistributed, and to be sometimes unable to determine the native\r\ncountries of each. Captain Smyth informs me, that, when engaged in his\r\nsurvey of the Mediterranean, he encountered a gale in the Gulf of Lyons,\r\nat the distance of between twenty and thirty leagues from the coast of\r\nFrance, which bore along many land birds of various species, some of\r\nwhich alighted on the ship, while others were thrown with violence\r\nagainst the sails. In this manner islands become tenanted by species of\r\nbirds inhabiting the nearest mainland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution and Dissemination of Reptiles._\r\n\r\nA few facts respecting the third great class of vertebrated animals will\r\nsuffice to show that the plan of nature in regard to their location on\r\nthe globe is perfectly analogous to that already exemplified in other\r\nparts of the organic creation, and has probably been determined by\r\nsimilar causes.\r\n\r\n_Habitations of reptiles._--Of the great saurians, the gavials which\r\ninhabit the Ganges differ from the cayman of America, or the crocodile\r\nof the Nile. The monitor of New Holland is specifically distinct from\r\nthe Indian species; these latter, again, from the African, and all from\r\ntheir congeners in the new world. So in regard to snakes; we find the\r\nboa of America represented by the python, a different though nearly\r\nallied genus in India. America is the country of the rattlesnake;\r\nAfrica, of the cerastes; and Asia, of the hooded snake, or cobra di\r\ncapello. The amphibious genera Siren and Menopoma belong to North\r\nAmerica, possessing both lungs and gills, and respiring at pleasure\r\neither air or water. The only analogous animal of the old world is the\r\n_Proteus anguinus_ of the lakes of Lower Carniola, and the grotto of\r\nAdelsberg between Trieste and Vienna.[906]\r\n\r\nThere is a legend that St. Patrick expelled all reptiles from Ireland;\r\nand certain it is that none of the three species of snakes common in\r\nEngland, nor the toad, have been observed there by naturalists. They\r\nhave our common frog, and our water-newt, and according to Ray (Quad.\r\n264.), the green lizard (_Lacerta viridis_).\r\n\r\n_Migrations of the larger reptiles._--The range of the large reptiles\r\nis, in general, quite as limited as that of some orders of the\r\nterrestrial mammalia. The great saurians sometimes cross a considerable\r\ntract in order to pass from one river to another; but their motions by\r\nland are generally slower than those of quadrupeds. By water, however,\r\nthey may transport themselves to distant situations more easily. The\r\nlarger alligator of the Ganges sometimes descends beyond the brackish\r\nwater of the delta into the sea; and in such cases it might chance to be\r\ndrifted away by a current, and survive till it reached a shore at some\r\ndistance; but such casualties are probably very rare.\r\n\r\nTurtles migrate in large droves from one part of the ocean to another\r\nduring the ovipositing season; and they find their way annually to the\r\nisland of Ascension, from which the nearest land is about 800 miles\r\ndistant. Dr. Fleming mentions, that an individual of the hawk's bill\r\nturtle (_Chelonia imbricata_), so common in the American seas, has been\r\ntaken at Papa Stour, one of the West Zetland Islands;[907] and,\r\naccording to Sibbald, \"the same animal came into Orkney.\" Another was\r\ntaken, in 1774, in the Severn, according to Turton. Two instances, also,\r\nof the occurrence of the leathern tortoise (_C. coriacea_), on the coast\r\nof Cornwall, in 1756, are mentioned by Borlase. These animals of more\r\nsouthern seas can be considered only as stragglers, attracted to our\r\nshores during uncommonly warm seasons by an abundant supply of food, or\r\ncarried by the Gulf stream, or driven by storms to high latitudes.\r\n\r\nSome of the smaller reptiles lay their eggs on aquatic plants; and these\r\nmust often be borne rapidly by rivers, and conveyed to distant regions\r\nin a manner similar to the dispersion of seeds before adverted to. But\r\nthat the larger ophidians may be themselves transported across the seas,\r\nis evident from the following most interesting account of the arrival of\r\none at the island of St. Vincent. It is worthy of being recorded, says\r\nMr. Guilding, \"that a noble specimen of the _Boa constrictor_ was lately\r\nconveyed to us by the currents, twisted round the trunk of a large sound\r\ncedar tree, which had probably been washed out of the bank by the floods\r\nof some great South American river, while its huge folds hung on the\r\nbranches, as it waited for its prey. The monster was fortunately\r\ndestroyed after killing a few sheep, and his skeleton now hangs before\r\nme in my study, putting me in mind how much reason I might have had to\r\nfear in my future rambles through the forests of St. Vincent, had this\r\nformidable reptile been a pregnant female, and escaped to a safe\r\nretreat.\"[908]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nLAWS WHICH REGULATE THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF\r\nSPECIES--_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Geographical distribution and migration of Fish--of Testaoea--of\r\n    Zoophytes--Distribution of Insects--Migratory instincts of some\r\n    species--Certain types characterize particular countries--Their\r\n    means of dissemination--Geographical distribution and diffusion of\r\n    man--Speculations as to the birth-place of the human\r\n    species--Progress of human population--Drifting of canoes to vast\r\n    distances--On the involuntary influence of man in extending the\r\n    range of many other species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution and Migrations of Fish._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we are less acquainted with the habitations of marine animals\r\nthan with the grouping of the terrestrial species before described, yet\r\nit is well ascertained that their distribution is governed by the same\r\ngeneral laws. The testimony borne by MM. Paron and Lesueur to this\r\nimportant fact is remarkably strong. These eminent naturalists, after\r\ncollecting and describing many thousand species of marine animals which\r\nthey brought to Europe from the southern hemisphere, insist most\r\nemphatically on their distinctness from those north of the equator; and\r\nthis remark they extend to animals of all classes, from those of a more\r\nsimple to those of a more complex organization--from the sponges and\r\nMedusae to the Cetacea. \"Among all those which we have been able to\r\nexamine,\" say they, \"with our own eyes, or with regard to which it has\r\nappeared to us possible to pronounce with certainty, there is not a\r\nsingle animal of the southern regions which is not distinguished by\r\nessential characters from the analogous species in the northern\r\nseas.\"[909]\r\n\r\nOn comparing the freshwater fish of Europe and North America, Sir John\r\nRichardson remarks, that the only species which is unequivocally common\r\nto the two continents is the pike (_Esox lucius_); and it is curious\r\nthat this fish is unknown to the westward of the Rocky Mountains, the\r\nvery coast which approaches nearest to the old continent.[910] According\r\nto the same author the genera of freshwater fish in China agree closely\r\nwith those of the peninsula of India, but the species are not the same.\r\n\"As in the distribution,\" he adds, \"of marine fish, the interposition of\r\na continent stretching from the tropics far into the temperate or colder\r\nparts of the ocean, separate different ichthyological groups; so with\r\nrespect to the freshwater species, the intrusion of arms of the sea\r\nrunning far to the northwards, or the interposition of a lofty\r\nmountain-chain, effects the same thing. The freshwater fish of the Cape\r\nof Good Hope and the South American ones, are different from those of\r\nIndia and China, &c.\"[911]\r\n\r\nCuvier and Valenciennes, in their \"Histoire des Poissons,\" observe, that\r\nvery few species of fish cross the Atlantic. Although their statement is\r\ncorrect, it is found that a great many species are common to the\r\nopposite sides of the Indian Ocean, inhabiting alike the Red Sea, the\r\neastern coast of Africa, Madagascar, the Mauritius, the Indian Ocean,\r\nthe southern seas of China, the Malay archipelago, the northern coasts\r\nof Australia, and the whole of Polynesia![912] This very wide diffusion,\r\nsays Sir J. Richardson, may have been promoted by chains of islands\r\nrunning east and west, which are wanting in the deep Atlantic. An\r\narchipelago extending far in longitude, favours the migration of fish by\r\nmultiplying the places of deposit for spawn along the shores of islands,\r\nand on intervening coral banks; and in such places, also, fish find\r\ntheir appropriate food.\r\n\r\nThe flying fish are found (some stragglers excepted) only between the\r\ntropics: in receding from the line, they never approach a higher\r\nlatitude than the fortieth parallel. The course of the Gulf stream,\r\nhowever, and the warmth of its water, enable some tropical fish to\r\nextend their habitations far into the temperate zone; thus the chaetodons\r\nwhich abound in the seas of hot climates, are found among the Bermudas\r\non the thirty-second parallel, where they are preserved in basins\r\ninclosed from the sea, as an important article of food for the garrison\r\nand inhabitants. Other fish, following the direction of the same great\r\ncurrent, range from the coast of Brazil to the banks of\r\nNewfoundland.[913]\r\n\r\nAll are aware that there are certain fish of passage which have their\r\nperiodical migrations, like some tribes of birds. The salmon, towards\r\nthe season of spawning, ascends the rivers for hundreds of miles,\r\nleaping up the cataracts which it meets in its course, and then retreats\r\nagain into the depths of the ocean. The herring and the haddock, after\r\nfrequenting certain shores, in vast shoals, for a series of years,\r\ndesert them again, and resort to other stations, followed by the species\r\nwhich prey on them. Eels are said to descend into the sea for the\r\npurpose of producing their young, which are seen returning into the\r\nfresh water by myriads, extremely small in size, but possessing the\r\npower of surmounting every obstacle which occurs in the course of a\r\nriver, by applying their slimy and glutinous bodies to the surface of\r\nrocks, or the gates of a lock, even when dry, and so climbing over\r\nit.[914] Before the year 1800 there were no eels in Lake Wener, the\r\nlargest inland lake in Sweden, which discharges its waters by the\r\ncelebrated cataracts of Trolhattan. But I am informed by Professor\r\nNilsson, that since the canal was opened uniting the river Gotha with\r\nthe lake by a series of nine locks, each of great height, eels have been\r\nobserved in abundance in the lake. It appears, therefore, that though\r\nthey were unable to ascend the falls, they have made their way by the\r\nlocks, by which in a very short space a difference of level of 114 feet\r\nis overcome.\r\n\r\nGmelin says, that the Anseres (wild geese, ducks, and others) subsist,\r\nin their migrations, on the spawn of fish; and that oftentimes, when\r\nthey void the spawn, two or three days afterwards, the eggs retain their\r\nvitality unimpaired.[915] When there are many disconnected freshwater\r\nlakes in a mountainous region, at various elevations, each remote from\r\nthe other, it has often been deemed inconceivable how they could all\r\nbecome stocked with fish from one common source; but it has been\r\nsuggested, that the minute eggs of these animals may sometimes be\r\nentangled in the feathers of water-fowl. These, when they alight to wash\r\nand plume themselves in the water, may often unconsciously contribute to\r\npropagate swarms of fish, which, in due season, will supply them with\r\nfood. Some of the water-beetles, also, as the Dyticidae, are amphibious,\r\nand in the evening quit their lakes and pools, and, flying in the air,\r\ntransport the minute ova of fishes to distant waters. In this manner\r\nsome naturalists account for the fry of fish appearing occasionally in\r\nsmall pools caused by heavy rains; but the showers of small fish, stated\r\nin so many accounts to have fallen from the atmosphere, require farther\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution and Migrations of Testacea._\r\n\r\nThe Testacea, of which so great a variety of species occurs in the sea,\r\nare a class of animals of peculiar importance to the geologist; because\r\ntheir remains are found in strata of all ages, and generally in a higher\r\nstate of preservation than those of other organic beings. Climate has a\r\ndecided influence on the geographical distribution of species in this\r\nclass; but as there is much greater uniformity of temperature in the\r\nwaters of the ocean, than in the atmosphere which invests the land, the\r\ndiffusion of marine mollusks is on the whole more extensive.\r\n\r\nSome forms attain their fullest development in warm latitudes; and are\r\noften exclusively confined to the torrid zone, as _Nautilus_, _Harpa_,\r\n_Terebellum_, _Pyramidella_, _Delphinula_, _Aspergillum_, _Tridacna_,\r\n_Cucullaea_, _Crassatella_, _Corbis_, _Perna_, and _Plicatula_. Other\r\nforms are limited to one region of the sea, as the _Trigonia_ to parts\r\nof Australia, and the _Concholepas_ to the western coast of South\r\nAmerica. The marine species inhabiting the ocean on the opposite sides\r\nof the narrow isthmus of Panama, are found to differ almost entirely, as\r\nwe might have anticipated, since a West Indian mollusk cannot enter the\r\nPacific without coasting round South America, and passing through the\r\ninclement climate of Cape Horn. The continuity of the existing lines of\r\ncontinent from north to south, prevents any one species from belting the\r\nglobe, or from following the direction of the isothermal lines.\r\n\r\nCurrents also flowing permanently in certain directions, and the influx\r\nat certain points of great bodies of fresh water, limit the extension of\r\nmany species. Those which love deep water are arrested by shoals;\r\nothers, fitted for shallow seas, cannot migrate across unfathomable\r\nabysses. The nature also of the ground has an important influence on the\r\ntestaceous fauna, both on the land and beneath the waters. Certain\r\nspecies prefer a sandy, others a gravelly, and some a muddy sea-bottom.\r\nOn the land, limestone is of all rocks the most favourable to the number\r\nand propagation of species of the genera Helix, Clausilia, Bulimus, and\r\nothers. Professor E. Forbes has shown as the result of his labours in\r\ndredging in the AEgean Sea, that there are eight well-marked regions of\r\ndepth, each characterized by its peculiar testaceous fauna. The first of\r\nthese, called the littoral zone, extends to a depth of two fathoms only;\r\nbut this narrow belt is inhabited by more than one hundred species. The\r\nsecond region, of which ten fathoms is the inferior limit, is almost\r\nequally populous; and a copious list of species is given as\r\ncharacteristic of each region down to the seventh, which lies between\r\nthe depths of 80 and 105 fathoms, all the inhabited space below this\r\nbeing included in the eighth province, where no less than 65 species of\r\nTestacea have been taken. The majority of the shells in this lowest zone\r\nare white or transparent. Only two species of Mollusca are common to\r\nall the eight regions, namely, _Arca lactea_ and _Cerithium lima_.[916]\r\n\r\n_Great range of some provinces and species._--In Europe conchologists\r\ndistinguish between the arctic fauna, the southern boundary of which\r\ncorresponds with the isothermal line of 32 degrees F., and the Celtic,\r\nwhich, commencing with that limit as its northern frontier, extends\r\nsouthwards to the mouth of the English Channel and Cape Finisterre, in\r\nFrance. From that point begins the Lusitanian fauna, which, according to\r\nthe recent observations of Mr. M'Andrew (1852), ranges to the Canary\r\nIslands. The Mediterranean province is distinct from all those above\r\nenumerated, although it has some species in common with each.\r\n\r\nThe Indo-Pacific region is by far the most extensive of all. It reaches\r\nfrom the Red Sea and the eastern coast of Africa, to the Indian\r\nArchipelago, and adjoining parts of the Pacific Ocean. To the geologist\r\nit furnishes a fact of no small interest, by teaching us that one group\r\nof living species of mollusca may prevail throughout an area exceeding\r\nin magnitude the utmost limits we can as yet assign to any assemblage of\r\ncontemporaneous fossil species. Mr. Cuming obtained more than a hundred\r\nspecies of shells from the eastern coast of Africa identical with those\r\ncollected by himself at the Philippines and in the eastern coral islands\r\nof the Pacific Ocean, a distance equal to that from pole to pole.[917]\r\n\r\nCertain species of the genus _Ianthina_ have a very wide range, being\r\ncommon to seas north and south of the equator. They are all provided\r\nwith a beautifully contrived float, which renders them buoyant,\r\nfacilitating their dispersion, and enabling them to become active agents\r\nin disseminating other species. Captain King took a specimen of\r\n_Ianthina fragilis_, alive, a little north of the equator, so loaded\r\nwith barnacles (_Pentelasmis_) and their ova that the upper part of its\r\nshell was invisible. The \"Rock Whelk\" (_Purpura lapillus_), a well-known\r\nBritish univalve, inhabits both the North Atlantic and North Pacific.\r\n\r\n_Helix putris_ (_Succinea putris_, Lam.), so common in Europe, where it\r\nreaches from Norway to Italy, is also said to occur in the United States\r\nand in Newfoundland. As this animal inhabits constantly the borders of\r\npools and streams where there is much moisture, it is not impossible\r\nthat different water-fowl have been the agents of spreading some of its\r\nminute eggs, which may have been entangled in their feathers. The\r\nfreshwater snail, _Lymneus palustris_, so abundant in English ponds,\r\nranges uninterruptedly from Europe to Cashmere, and thence to the\r\neastern parts of Asia. _Helix aspersa_, one of the commonest of our\r\nlarger land-shells, is found in St. Helena and other distant countries.\r\nSome conchologists have conjectured that it was accidentally imported\r\ninto St. Helena in some ship; for it is an eatable species, and these\r\nanimals are capable of retaining life during long voyages, without air\r\nor nourishment.[918]\r\n\r\nPerhaps no species has a better claim to be called cosmopolite than one\r\nof our British bivalves, _Saxicava rugosa_. It is spread over all the\r\nnorth-polar seas, and ranges in one direction through Europe to Senegal,\r\noccurring on both sides of the Atlantic; while in another it finds its\r\nway into the North Pacific, and thence to the Indian Ocean. Nor do its\r\nmigrations cease till it reaches the Australian seas.\r\n\r\nA British brachiopod, named _Terebratula caput-serpentis_, is common,\r\naccording to Professor E. Forbes, to both sides of the North Atlantic,\r\nand to the South African and Chinese seas.\r\n\r\n_Confined range of other species._--Mr. Lowe, in a memoir published in\r\nthe Cambridge Transactions in 1834, enumerates seventy-one species of\r\nland Mollusca, collected by him in the islands of Madeira and Porto\r\nSanto, sixty of which belonged to the genus Helix alone, including as\r\nsub-genera Bulimus and Achatina, and excluding Vitrina and Clausilia;\r\nforty-four of these are new. It is remarkable that very few of the\r\nabove-mentioned species are common to the neighbouring archipelago of\r\nthe Canaries; but it is a still more striking fact, that of the sixty\r\nspecies of the three genera above mentioned, thirty-one are natives of\r\nPorto Santo; whereas, in Madeira, which contains ten times the\r\nsuperficies, were found but twenty-nine. Of these only four were common\r\nto the two islands, which are separated by a distance of only twelve\r\nleagues; and two even of these four (namely _Helix rhodostoma_ and _H.\r\nventrosa_) are species of general diffusion, common to Madeira, the\r\nCanaries, and the south of Europe.[919]\r\n\r\nThe confined range of these mollusks may easily be explained, if we\r\nadmit that species have only one birth-place; and the only problem to be\r\nsolved would relate to the exceptions--to account for the dissemination\r\nof some species throughout several islands, and the European continent.\r\nMay not the eggs, when washed into the sea by the undermining of cliffs,\r\nor blown by a storm from the land, float uninjured to a distant shore?\r\n\r\n_Their mode of diffusion._--Notwithstanding the proverbially slow motion\r\nof snails and mollusks in general, and although many aquatic species\r\nadhere constantly to the same rock for their whole lives, they are by no\r\nmeans destitute of provision for disseminating themselves rapidly over a\r\nwide area. \"Some Mollusca,\" says Professor E. Forbes, \"migrate in their\r\nlarva state, for all of them undergo a metamorphosis either in the egg\r\nor out of the egg. The gasteropoda commence life under the form of a\r\nsmall spiral shell, and an animal furnished with ciliated wings, or\r\nlobes, like a pteropod, by means of which it can swim freely, and in\r\nthis form can migrate with ease through the sea.\"[920]\r\n\r\nWe are accustomed to associate in our minds the idea of the greatest\r\nlocomotive powers with the most mature and perfect state of each species\r\nof invertebrate animal, especially when they undergo a series of\r\ntransformations; but in all the Mollusca the reverse is true. The young\r\nfry of the cockle, for example (_Cardium_), possess, when young or in\r\nthe larva state, an apparatus which enables them both to swim and to be\r\ncarried along easily by a marine current. (See fig. 99.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99.\r\n\r\nTne young fry of a cockle (Cardium pygmaeum,) from Loven's Kongl.\r\nVetenskaps. Akadem.

They begin to move about from the moment they are hatched, by means\r\nof the long cilia, _a_, _a_, placed on the edges of the locomotive disk\r\nor velum. This disk shrinks up as they increase in size, and gradually\r\ndisappears, no trace of it being visible in the perfect animal.\r\n\r\nSome species of shell-bearing Mollusca lay their eggs in a sponge-like\r\nnidus, wherein the young remain enveloped for a time after their birth;\r\nand this buoyant substance floats far and wide as readily as sea-weed.\r\nThe young of other viviparous tribes are often borne along entangled in\r\nsea-weed. Sometimes they are so light, that, like grains of sand, they\r\ncan be easily moved by currents. Balani and Serpulae are sometimes found\r\nadhering to floating cocoa-nuts, and even to fragments of pumice. In\r\nrivers and lakes, on the other hand, aquatic univalves usually attach\r\ntheir eggs to leaves and sticks which have fallen into the water, and\r\nwhich are liable to be swept away during floods, from tributaries to the\r\nmain streams, and from thence to all parts of the same basins.\r\nParticular species may thus migrate during one season from the head\r\nwaters of the Mississippi, or any other great river, to countries\r\nbordering the sea, at the distance of many thousand miles.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the mode of attachment of these eggs will be seen in\r\nthe annexed cut. (Fig. 100.)\r\n\r\nThe habit of some Testacea to adhere to floating wood is proved by their\r\nfixing themselves to the bottoms of ships. By this mode of conveyance\r\n_Mytilus polymorphus_, previously known only in the Danube and Wolga,\r\nmay have been brought to the Commercial Docks in the Thames, and to\r\nHamburgh, where the species is now domiciled. But Mr. Gray suggests that\r\nas the animal is known to have the faculty of living for a very long\r\ntime out of water, it is more probable that it was brought in Russian\r\ntimber, than borne uninjured through the salt water at the bottom of a\r\nvessel.[921]\r\n\r\nA lobster (_Astacus marinus_) was lately taken alive covered with living\r\nmussels (_Mytilus edulis_)[922]; and a large female crab (_Cancer\r\npagurus_), covered with oysters, and bearing also _Anomia ephippium_,\r\nand Actiniae, was taken in April, 1832, off the English coast. The\r\noysters, seven in number, include individuals of six years' growth, and\r\nthe two largest are four inches long and three inches and a half broad.\r\nBoth the crab and the oysters were seen alive by Mr. Robert Brown.[923]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.\r\n\r\nEggs of Freshwater mollusks.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. Eggs of _Ampullaria ovata_ (a fluviatile species) fixed to\r\n            a small sprig which had fallen into the water.\r\n  Fig. 2.

Eggs of the common Limneus (_L. vulgaris_), adhering to\r\n            a dead stick under water.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom this example we learn the manner in which oysters may be diffused\r\nover every part of the sea where the crab wanders; and if they are at\r\nlength carried to a spot where there is nothing but fine mud, the\r\nfoundation of a new oyster-bank may be laid on the death of the crab. In\r\nthis instance the oysters survived the crab many days, and were killed\r\nat last only by long exposure to the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution and Migrations of Zoophytes._\r\n\r\nZoophytes are very imperfectly known; but there can be little doubt that\r\neach maritime region possesses species peculiar to itself. The\r\nMadrepores, or lamelliferous Polyparia, are found in their fullest\r\ndevelopment only in the tropical seas of Polynesia and the East and West\r\nIndies; and this family is represented only by a few species in our\r\nseas. The zoophytes of the Mediterranean, according to Ehrenberg, differ\r\nalmost entirely from those of the Red Sea, although only seventy miles\r\ndistant. Out of 120 species of Anthozoa, only two are common to both\r\nseas.[924] Paron and Lesueur, after studying the Holothuriae, Medusae, and\r\nother congeners of delicate and changeable forms, came to the conclusion\r\nthat each kind has its place of residence determined by the temperature\r\nnecessary to support its existence. Thus, for example, they found the\r\nabode of _Pyrosoma Atlantica_ to be confined to one particular region of\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean.[925]\r\n\r\nLet us now inquire how the transportation of zoophytes from one part of\r\nthe globe to another is effected. Many of them, as in the families\r\nFlustra and Sertularia, attach themselves to sea-weed, and are\r\noccasionally drifted along with it. Many fix themselves to the shells of\r\nMollusca, and are thus borne along by them to short distances. Others,\r\nlike some species of sea-pens, float about in the ocean, and are usually\r\nbelieved to possess powers of spontaneous motion. But the most frequent\r\nmode of transportation consists in the buoyancy of their eggs, or\r\ncertain small vesicles, which are detached, and are capable of becoming\r\nthe foundation of a new colony. These gems, as they are called, have, in\r\nmany instances, a locomotive power of their own, by which they proceed\r\nin a determinate direction for several days after separation from the\r\nparent. They are propelled by means of numerous short threads or\r\n_ciliae_, which are in constant and rapid vibration; and, when thus\r\nsupported in the water, they may be borne along by currents to a great\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThat some zoophytes adhere to floating bodies, is proved by their being\r\nfound attached to the bottoms of ships, like certain Testacea before\r\nalluded to.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution and Migrations of Insects._\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude this sketch of the manner in which the habitable parts\r\nof the earth are shared out among particular assemblages of organic\r\nbeings, I must offer a few remarks on insects, which, by their numbers\r\nand the variety of their powers and instincts, exert a prodigious\r\ninfluence in the economy of animate nature. As a large portion of these\r\nminute creatures are strictly dependent for their subsistence on certain\r\nspecies of vegetables, the entomological provinces must coincide in\r\nconsiderable degree with the botanical.\r\n\r\nAll the insects, says Latreille, brought from the eastern parts of Asia\r\nand China, whatever be their latitude and temperature, are distinct from\r\nthose of Europe and of Africa. The insects of the United States,\r\nalthough often approaching very close to our own, are, with very few\r\nexceptions, specifically distinguishable by some characters. In South\r\nAmerica, the equinoctial lands of New Granada and Peru on the one side,\r\nand of Guiana on the other, contain for the most part distinct groups;\r\nthe Andes forming the division, and interposing a narrow line of severe\r\ncold between climates otherwise very similar.[926]\r\n\r\n_Migratory instincts._--Nearly all the insects of the United States and\r\nCanada, differ specifically from the European; while those of Greenland\r\nappear to be in a great measure identical with our own. Some insects are\r\nvery local; while a few, on the contrary, are common to remote\r\ncountries, between which the torrid zone and the ocean intervene. Thus\r\nour painted lady butterfly (_Vanessa cardui_) re-appears at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope and in New Holland and Japan with scarcely a varying\r\nstreak.[927] The same species is said to be one of the few insects which\r\nare universally dispersed over the earth, being found in Europe, Asia,\r\nAfrica, and America; and its wide range is the more interesting, because\r\nit seems explained by its migratory instinct, seconded, no doubt, by a\r\ncapacity, enjoyed by few species, of enduring a great diversity of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nA vast swarm of this species, forming a column from ten to fifteen feet\r\nbroad, was, a few years since, observed in the Canton de Vaud; they\r\ntraversed the country with great rapidity from north to south, all\r\nflying onwards in regular order, close together, and not turning from\r\ntheir course on the approach of other objects. Professor Bonelli, of\r\nTurin, observed, in March of the same year, a similar swarm of the same\r\nspecies, also directing their flight from north to south, in Piedmont,\r\nin such immense numbers that at night the flowers were literally covered\r\nwith them. They had been traced from Coni, Raconi, Susa, &c. A similar\r\nflight at the end of the last century is recorded by M. Louch in the\r\nMemoirs of the Academy of Turin. The fact is the more worthy of notice,\r\nbecause the caterpillars of this butterfly are not gregarious, but\r\nsolitary from the moment that they are hatched; and this instinct\r\nremains dormant, while generation after generation passes away, till it\r\nsuddenly displays itself in full energy when their numbers happen to be\r\nin excess.\r\n\r\nNot only peculiar species, but certain types, distinguish particular\r\ncountries; and there are groups, observes Kirby, which represent each\r\nother in distant regions, whether in their form, their functions, or in\r\nboth. Thus the honey and wax of Europe, Asia, and Africa, are in each\r\ncase prepared by bees congenerous with our common hive-bee (_Apis_,\r\nLatr.); while, in America, this genus is nowhere indigenous, but is\r\nreplaced by Melipona, Trigona, and Euglossa; and in New Holland by\r\na still different but undescribed type.[928] The European bee (_Apis\r\nmellifica_), although not a native of the new world, is now established\r\nboth in North and South America. It was introduced into the United\r\nStates by some of the early settlers, and has since overspread the vast\r\nforests of the interior, building hives in the decayed trunks of trees.\r\n\"The Indians,\" says Irving, \"consider them as the harbinger of the white\r\nman, as the buffalo is of the red man, and say that in proportion as the\r\nbee advances the Indian and the buffalo retire. It is said,\" continues\r\nthe same writer, \"that the wild bee is seldom to be met with at any\r\ngreat distance from the frontier, and that they have always been the\r\nheralds of civilization, preceding it as it advanced from the Atlantic\r\nborders. Some of the ancient settlers of the west even pretend to give\r\nthe very year when the honey-bee first crossed the Mississippi.\"[929]\r\nThe same species is now also naturalized in Van Diemen's Land and New\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\nAs almost all insects are winged, they can readily spread themselves\r\nwherever their progress is not opposed by uncongenial climates, or by\r\nseas, mountains, and other physical impediments; and these barriers they\r\ncan sometimes surmount by abandoning themselves to violent winds, which,\r\nas I before stated, when speaking of the dispersion of seeds (p. 618.),\r\nmay in a few hours carry them to very considerable distances. On the\r\nAndes some sphinxes and flies have been observed by Humboldt, at the\r\nheight of 19,180 feet above the sea, and which appeared to him to have\r\nbeen involuntarily carried into these regions by ascending currents of\r\nair.[930]\r\n\r\nWhite mentions a remarkable shower of aphides which seem to have\r\nemigrated, with an east wind, from the great hop plantations of Kent and\r\nSussex, and blackened the shrubs and vegetables where they alighted at\r\nSelbourne, spreading at the same time in great clouds all along the vale\r\nfrom Farnham to Alton. These aphides are sometimes accompanied by vast\r\nnumbers of the common lady-bird (_Coccinella septempunctata_), which\r\nfeed upon them.[931]\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, says Kirby, that many of the insects which are\r\noccasionally observed to emigrate, as, for instance, the Libellulae,\r\nCoccinellae, Carabi, Cicadae, &c. are not usually social insects; but seem\r\nto congregate, like swallows, merely for the purpose of emigration.[932]\r\nHere, therefore, we have an example of an instinct developing itself on\r\ncertain rare emergencies, causing unsocial species to become gregarious\r\nand to venture sometimes even to cross the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe armies of locusts which darken the air in Africa, and traverse the\r\nglobe from Turkey to our southern counties in England, are well known to\r\nall. When the western gales sweep over the Pampas they bear along with\r\nthem myriads of insects of various kinds. As a proof of the manner in\r\nwhich species may be thus diffused, I may mention that when the Creole\r\nfrigate was lying in the outer roads off Buenos Ayres, in 1819, at the\r\ndistance of six miles from the land, her decks and rigging were suddenly\r\ncovered by thousands of flies and grains of sand. The sides of the\r\nvessel had just received a fresh coat of paint, to which the insects\r\nadhered in such numbers as to spot and disfigure the vessel, and to\r\nrender it necessary partially to renew the paint.[933] Captain W. H.\r\nSmyth was obliged to repaint his vessel, the Adventure, in the\r\nMediterranean, from the same cause. He was on his way from Malta to\r\nTripoli, when a southern wind blowing from the coast of Africa, then one\r\nhundred miles distant, drove such myriads of flies upon the fresh paint,\r\nthat not the smallest point was left unoccupied by insects.\r\n\r\nTo the southward of the river Plate, off Cape St. Antonio, and at the\r\ndistance of fifty miles from land, several large dragon-flies alighted\r\non the Adventure frigate, during Captain King's late expedition to the\r\nStraits of Magellan. If the wind abates when insects are thus crossing\r\nthe sea, the most delicate species are not necessarily drowned; for many\r\ncan repose without sinking on the water. The slender long-legged tipulae\r\nhave been seen standing on the surface of the sea, when driven out far\r\nfrom our coast, and took wing immediately on being approached.[934]\r\nExotic beetles are sometimes thrown on our shore, which revive after\r\nhaving been long drenched in salt water; and the periodical appearance\r\nof some conspicuous butterflies amongst us, after being unseen some for\r\nfive others for fifty years, has been ascribed, not without probability,\r\nto the agency of the winds.\r\n\r\nInundations of rivers, observes Kirby, if they happen at any season\r\nexcept in the depths of winter, always carry down a number of insects,\r\nfloating on the surface of bits of stick, weeds, &c.; so that when the\r\nwaters subside, the entomologist may generally reap a plentiful harvest.\r\nIn the dissemination, moreover, of these minute beings, as in that of\r\nplants, the larger animals play their part. Insects are, in numberless\r\ninstances, borne along in the coats of animals, or the feathers of\r\nbirds; and the eggs of some species are capable, like seeds, of\r\nresisting the digestive powers of the stomach, and after they are\r\nswallowed with herbage, may be ejected again unharmed in the dung.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution and Diffusion of Man._\r\n\r\nI have reserved for the last some observations on the range and\r\ndiffusion of the human species over the earth, and the influence of man\r\nin spreading other animals and plants, especially the terrestrial.\r\n\r\nMany naturalists have amused themselves in speculating on the probable\r\nbirth-place of mankind, the point from which, if we assume the whole\r\nhuman race to have descended from a single pair, the tide of emigration\r\nmust originally have proceeded. It has been always a favorite\r\nconjecture, that this birth-place was situated within or near the\r\ntropics, where perpetual summer reigns, and where fruits, herbs, and\r\nroots are plentifully supplied throughout the year. The climate of these\r\nregions, it has been said, is suited to a being born without any\r\ncovering, and who had not yet acquired the arts of building habitations\r\nor providing clothes.\r\n\r\n_Progress of Human Population._--\"The hunter state,\" it has been argued,\r\n\"which Montesquieu placed the first, was probably only the second stage\r\nto which mankind arrived; since so many arts must have been invented to\r\ncatch a salmon, or a deer, that society could no longer have been in its\r\ninfancy when they came into use.\"[935] When regions where the\r\nspontaneous fruits of the earth abound became overpeopled, men would\r\nnaturally diffuse themselves over the neighboring parts of the temperate\r\nzone; but a considerable time would probably elapse before this event\r\ntook place; and it is possible, as a writer before cited observes, that\r\nin the interval before the multiplication of their numbers and their\r\nincreasing wants had compelled them to emigrate, some arts to take\r\nanimals were invented, but far inferior to what we see practised at this\r\nday among savages. As their habitations gradually advanced into the\r\ntemperate zone, the new difficulties they had to encounter would call\r\nforth by degrees the spirit of invention, and the probability of such\r\ninventions always rises with the number of people involved in the same\r\nnecessity.[936]\r\n\r\nA distinguished modern writer, who coincides for the most part in the\r\nviews above mentioned, has introduced one of the persons in his second\r\ndialogue, as objecting to the theory of the human race having gradually\r\nadvanced from a savage to a civilized state, on the ground that \"the\r\nfirst man must have inevitably been destroyed by the elements or\r\ndevoured by savage beasts, so infinitely his superiors in physical\r\nforce.\"[937] He then contends against the difficulty here started by\r\nvarious arguments, all of which were, perhaps, superfluous; for if a\r\nphilosopher is pleased to indulge in conjectures on this subject, why\r\nshould he not assign, as the original seat of man, some one of those\r\nlarge islands within the tropics, which are as free from large beasts of\r\nprey as Van Diemen's Land or Australia? Here man may have remained for a\r\nperiod, peculiar to a single island, just as some of the large\r\nanthropomorphous species are now limited to one island within the\r\ntropics. In such a situation, the new-born race might have lived in\r\nsecurity, though far more helpless than the New Holland savages, and\r\nmight have found abundance of vegetable food. Colonies may afterwards\r\nhave been sent forth from this mother country, and then the peopling of\r\nthe earth may have proceeded according to the hypothesis before alluded\r\nto.\r\n\r\nTo form a probable conjecture respecting the country from whence the\r\nearly civilization of India was derived, has been found almost as\r\ndifficult as to determine the original birth-place of the human race.\r\nThat the dawn of oriental civilization did not arise within the limits\r\nof the tropics, is the conclusion to which Baron William von Humboldt\r\nhas come after much patient research into \"the diversities of the\r\nstructure of language and their influence on the mental development of\r\nthe human race.\" According to him the ancient Zend country from whence\r\nthe spread of knowledge and the arts has been traced in a south-easterly\r\ndirection, lay to the north-west of the upper Indus.[938]\r\n\r\nAs to the time of the first appearance of man upon the earth, if we are\r\nto judge from the discordance of opinion amongst celebrated\r\nchronologers, not even a rude approximation has yet been made towards\r\ndetermining a point of so much interest. The problem seems hitherto to\r\nhave baffled the curiosity of the antiquary, if possible, more\r\ncompletely than the fixing on a geographical site for the original\r\nhabitation of the ancestors of the human race. The Chevalier Bunsen, in\r\nhis elaborate and philosophical work on Ancient Egypt,[939] has\r\nsatisfied not a few of the learned, by an appeal to monumental\r\ninscriptions still extant, that the successive dynasties of kings may be\r\ntraced back without a break, to Menes, and that the date of his reign\r\nwould correspond with the year 3640 B. C. He supposes at the same time,\r\nwhat is most reasonable, that the Egyptian people must have existed for\r\na long period (probably at least for five centuries), in their earlier\r\nand less settled state, before they reached the point of civilization at\r\nwhich Menes consolidated them into a great and united empire. This would\r\ncarry us back to upwards of 4000 years B. C., or to an epoch coincident\r\nwith that commonly set down for the creation of the world in accordance\r\nwith computations founded on the combined ages of the successive\r\nantediluvian patriarchs. It follows that the same epoch of Menes is\r\nanterior by a great many centuries to the most ancient of the dates\r\nusually fixed upon for the Mosaic deluge. The fact that no record or\r\ntradition of any great and overwhelming flood has been detected in the\r\nmythology, or monumental annals of the Egyptians, will suggest many\r\nreflections to a geologist who has weighed well the evidence we possess\r\nof a variety of partial deluges which have happened in districts not\r\nfree like Egypt, for the last 3000 years, from earthquakes and other\r\ncauses of great aqueous catastrophes. The tales and legends of\r\ncalamitous floods preserved in Greece, Asia Minor, the southern shores\r\nof the Baltic, China, Peru, and Chili, have, as we have seen, been all\r\nof them handed down to us by the inhabitants of regions in which the\r\noperation of natural causes in modern times, and the recurrence of a\r\nsuccession of disastrous floods, afford us data for interpreting the\r\nmeaning of the obscure traditions of an illiterate age.[940]\r\n\r\nIn his learned treatise on ancient chronology, Dr. Hales has selected,\r\nfrom a much greater number, a list of no less than 120 authors, all of\r\nwhom give a different period for the epoch of the creation of the world,\r\nthe extreme range of difference between them amounting to no less than\r\n3268 years. It appears that even amongst authorities, who in England are\r\ngenerally regarded, as orthodox, there is a variance, not of years or of\r\none or two centuries, but of upwards of a millennium, according as they\r\nhave preferred to follow the Hebrew, or the Samaritan, or the Greek\r\nversions of the Mosaic writings. Can we then wonder that they who\r\ndecipher the monuments of Egypt, or the geologist who interprets the\r\nearth's autobiography, should arrive at views respecting the date of an\r\nancient empire, or the age of our planet, irreconcilable with every one\r\nof these numerous and conflicting chronologies? The want of agreement\r\namongst the learned in regard to the probable date of the deluge of Noah\r\nis a source of far greater perplexity and confusion than our extreme\r\nuncertainty as to the epoch of the creation,--the deluge being a\r\ncomparatively modern event, from which the repeopling of the earth and\r\nthe history of the present races of mankind is made to begin.\r\n\r\nNaturalists have long felt that to render probable the received opinion\r\nthat all the leading varieties of the human family have originally\r\nsprung from a single pair, (a doctrine against which there appears to me\r\nto be no sound objection,) a much greater lapse of time is required for\r\nthe slow and gradual formation of races, (such as the Caucasian,\r\nMongolian, and Negro,) than is embraced in any of the popular systems of\r\nchronology. The existence of two of those marked varieties above\r\nmentioned can be traced back 3000 years before the present time, or to\r\nthe painting of pictures, preserved in the tombs or on the walls of\r\nburied temples in Egypt. In these we behold the Negro and Caucasian\r\nphysiognomies portrayed as faithfully and in as strong contrast as if\r\nthe likenesses of those races had been taken yesterday. When we consider\r\ntherefore the extreme slowness of the changes, which climate and other\r\nmodifying causes have produced in modern times, we must allow for a vast\r\nseries of antecedent ages, in the course of which the long-continued\r\ninfluence of similar external circumstances gave rise to peculiarities,\r\nprobably increased in many successive generations, until they were fixed\r\nby hereditary transmission. The characteristic forms and features thus\r\nacquired by certain tribes, may have been afterwards diffused by\r\nmigration from a few centres over wide continental spaces. The theory,\r\ntherefore, that all the races of man have come from one common stock\r\nreceives support from every investigation which forces us to expand our\r\nideas of the duration of past time, or which multiplies the number of\r\nyears that have passed away since the origin of man. Hitherto, geology\r\nhas neither enlarged nor circumscribed the \"human period;\" but simply\r\nproved that in the history of animated nature it is comparatively\r\nmodern, or the last of a long series of antecedent epochs, in each of\r\nwhich the earth has been successively peopled by distinct species of\r\nanimals and plants.\r\n\r\nIn an early stage of society the necessity of hunting acts as a\r\nprinciple of repulsion, causing men to spread with the greatest rapidity\r\nover a country, until the whole is covered with scattered settlements.\r\nIt has been calculated that eight hundred acres of hunting-ground\r\nproduce only as much food as half an acre of arable land. When the game\r\nhas been in a great measure exhausted, and a state of pasturage\r\nsucceeds, the several hunter tribes, being already scattered, may\r\nmultiply in a short time into the greatest number which the pastoral\r\nstate is capable of sustaining. The necessity, says Brand, thus imposed\r\nupon the two savage states, of dispersing themselves far and wide over\r\nthe country, affords a reason why, at a very early period, the worst\r\nparts of the earth may have become inhabited.\r\n\r\nBut this reason, it may be said, is only applicable in as far as regards\r\nthe peopling of a continuous continent; whereas the smallest islands,\r\nhowever remote from continents, have almost always been found inhabited\r\nby man. St. Helena, it is true, afforded an exception; for when that\r\nisland was discovered in 1501, it was only inhabited by sea-fowl, and\r\noccasionally by seals and turtles, and was covered with a forest of\r\ntrees and shrubs, all of species peculiar to it, with one or two\r\nexceptions, and which seem to have been expressly created for this\r\nremote and insulated spot.[941]\r\n\r\nThe islands also of Mauritius, Bourbon, Pitcairns, and Juan Fernandez,\r\nand those of the Galapagos archipelago, one of which is seventy miles\r\nlong, were inhabited when first discovered, and, what is more remarkable\r\nthan all, the Falkland Islands, which together are 120 miles in length\r\nby 60 in breadth, and abounding in food fit for the support of man.\r\n\r\n_Drifting of canoes to vast distances._--But very few of the numerous\r\ncoral islets and volcanoes of the vast Pacific, capable of sustaining a\r\nfew families of men, have been found untenanted; and we have, therefore,\r\nto inquire whence and by what means, if all the members of the great\r\nhuman family have had one common source, could those savages have\r\nmigrated. Cook, Forster, and others, have remarked that parties of\r\nsavages in their canoes must have often lost their way, and must have\r\nbeen driven on distant shores, where they were forced to remain,\r\ndeprived both of the means and of the requisite intelligence for\r\nreturning to their own country. Thus Captain Cook found on the island of\r\nWateoo three inhabitants of Otaheite, who had been drifted thither in a\r\ncanoe, although the distance between the two isles is 550 miles. In\r\n1696, two canoes, containing thirty persons, who had left Ancorso, were\r\nthrown by contrary winds and storms on the island of Samar, one of the\r\nPhilippines, at a distance of 800 miles. In 1721, two canoes, one of\r\nwhich contained twenty-four, and the other six persons, men, women, and\r\nchildren, were drifted from an island called Farroilep to the island of\r\nGuaham, one of the Marians, a distance of 200 miles.[942]\r\n\r\nKotzebue, when investigating the Coral Isles of Radack, at the eastern\r\nextremity of the Caroline Isles, became acquainted with a person of the\r\nname of Kadu, who was a native of Ulea, an isle 1500 miles distant, from\r\nwhich he had been drifted with a party. Kadu and three of his\r\ncountrymen one day left Ulea in a sailing boat, when a violent storm\r\narose, and drove them out of their course: they drifted about the open\r\nsea for eight months, according to their reckoning by the moon, making a\r\nknot on a cord at every new moon. Being expert fishermen, they subsisted\r\nentirely on the produce of the sea; and when the rain fell, laid in as\r\nmuch fresh water as they had vessels to contain it. \"Kadu,\" says\r\nKotzebue, \"who was the best diver, frequently went down to the bottom of\r\nthe sea, where it is well known that the water is not so salt, with a\r\ncocoa-nut shell, with only a small opening.\"[943] When these unfortunate\r\nmen reached the isles of Radack, every hope and almost every feeling had\r\ndied within them; their sail had long been destroyed, their canoe had\r\nlong been the sport of winds and waves, and they were picked up by the\r\ninhabitants of Aur in a state of insensibility; but by the hospitable\r\ncare of those islanders they soon recovered, and were restored to\r\nperfect health.[944]\r\n\r\nCaptain Beechey, in his voyage to the Pacific, fell in with some natives\r\nof the Coral Islands, who had in a similar manner been carried to a\r\ngreat distance from their native country. They had embarked, to the\r\nnumber of 150 souls, in three double canoes, from Anaa, or Chain Island,\r\nsituated about three hundred miles to the eastward of Otaheite. They\r\nwere overtaken by the monsoon, which dispersed the canoes; and after\r\ndriving them about the ocean, left them becalmed, so that a great number\r\nof persons perished. Two of the canoes were never heard of; but the\r\nother was drifted from one uninhabited island to another, at each of\r\nwhich the voyagers obtained a few provisions; and at length, after\r\nhaving wandered for a distance of 600 miles, they were found and carried\r\nto their home in the Blossom.[945]\r\n\r\nMr. Crawfurd informs me that there are several well-authenticated\r\naccounts of canoes having been drifted from Sumatra to Madagascar, and\r\nby such causes a portion of the Malayan language, with some useful\r\nplants, have been transferred to that island, which is principally\r\npeopled by negroes.\r\n\r\nThe space traversed in some of these instances was so great, that\r\nsimilar accidents might suffice to transport canoes from various parts\r\nof Africa to the shores of South America, or from Spain to the Azores,\r\nand thence to North America; so that man, even in a rude state of\r\nsociety, is liable to be scattered involuntarily by the winds and waves\r\nover the globe, in a manner singularly analogous to that in which many\r\nplants and animals are diffused. We ought not, then, to wonder, that\r\nduring the ages required for some tribes of the human race to attain\r\nthat advanced stage of civilization which empowers the navigator to\r\ncross the ocean in all directions with security, the whole earth should\r\nhave become the abode of rude tribes of hunters and fishers. Were the\r\nwhole of mankind now cut off, with the exception of one family,\r\ninhabiting the old or new continent, or Australia, or even some coral\r\nislet of the Pacific, we might expect their descendants, though they\r\nshould never become more enlightened than the South Sea Islanders or the\r\nEsquimaux, to spread in the course of ages over the whole earth,\r\ndiffused partly by the tendency of population to increase, in a limited\r\ndistrict, beyond the means of subsistence, and partly by the accidental\r\ndrifting of canoes by tides and currents to distant shores.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Involuntary Influence of Man in diffusing Animals and Plants._\r\n\r\nMany of the general remarks which have been made respecting the\r\ninfluence of man in spreading or in checking the diffusion of plants\r\napply equally to his relations with the animal kingdom. On a future\r\noccasion I shall be led to speak of the instrumentality of our species\r\nin naturalizing useful animals and plants in new regions, when\r\nexplaining my views of the effects which the spreading and increase of\r\ncertain species exert in the extirpation of others. At present I shall\r\nconfine myself to a few remarks on the involuntary aid which man lends\r\nto the dissemination of species.\r\n\r\nIn the mammiferous class our influence is chiefly displayed in\r\nincreasing the number of quadrupeds which are serviceable to us, and in\r\nexterminating or reducing the number of those which are noxious.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, we unintentionally promote the multiplication of\r\ninimical species, as when we introduced the rat, which was not\r\nindigenous in the new world, into all parts of America. They have been\r\nconveyed over in ships, and now infest a great multitude of islands and\r\nparts of that continent. In like manner the Norway rat (_Mus decumanus_)\r\nhas been imported into England, where it plunders our property in ships\r\nand houses.\r\n\r\nAmong birds, the house sparrow may be cited as a species known to have\r\nextended its range with the tillage of the soil. During the last century\r\nit has spread gradually over Asiatic Russia towards the north and east,\r\nalways following the progress of cultivation. It made its first\r\nappearance on the Irtisch in Tobolsk, soon after the Russians had\r\nploughed the land. It came in 1735 up the Obi to Beresow, and four years\r\nafter to Naryn, about fifteen degrees of longitude farther east. In\r\n1710, it had been seen in the higher parts of the coast of the Lena, in\r\nthe government of Irkutzk. In all these places it is now common, but is\r\nnot yet found in the uncultivated regions of Kamtschatka.[946]\r\n\r\nThe great viper (_Fer de lance_), a species no less venomous than the\r\nrattlesnake, which now ravages Martinique and St. Lucia, was\r\naccidentally introduced by man, and exists in no other part of the West\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\nMany parasitic insects which attack our persons, and some of which are\r\nsupposed to be peculiar to our species, have been carried into all parts\r\nof the earth, and have as high a claim as man to a _universal_\r\ngeographical distribution.\r\n\r\nA great variety of insects have been transported in ships from one\r\ncountry to another, especially in warmer latitudes. The European\r\nhouse-fly has been introduced in this way into all the South Sea\r\nIslands. Notwithstanding the coldness of our climate in England we have\r\nbeen unable to prevent the cockroach (_Blatta orientalis_) from entering\r\nand diffusing itself in our ovens and kneading troughs, and availing\r\nitself of the artificial warmth which we afford. It is well known also,\r\nthat beetles, and many other kinds of ligniperdous insects, have been\r\nintroduced into Great Britain in timber; especially several North\r\nAmerican species. \"The commercial relations,\" says Malte-Brun[947],\r\n\"between France and India have transported from the latter country the\r\naphis, which destroys the apple tree, and two sorts of Neuroptera, the\r\n_Lucifuga_ and _Flavicola_, mostly confined to Provence and the\r\nneighbourhood of Bourdeaux, where they devour the timber in the houses\r\nand naval arsenals.\"\r\n\r\nAmong mollusks we may mention the _Teredo navalis_, which is a native of\r\nequatorial seas, but which, by adhering to the bottom of ships, was\r\ntransported to Holland, where it has been most destructive to vessels\r\nand piles. The same species has also become naturalized in England, and\r\nother countries enjoying an extensive commerce. _Bulimus undatus_, a\r\nland species of considerable size, native of Jamaica and other West\r\nIndian islands, has been imported, adhering to tropical timber, into\r\nLiverpool; and, as I learn from Mr. Broderip, is now naturalized in the\r\nwoods near that town.\r\n\r\nIn all these and innumerable other instances we may regard the\r\ninvoluntary agency of man as strictly analogous to that of the inferior\r\nanimals. Like them, we unconsciously contribute to extend or limit the\r\ngeographical range and numbers of certain species, in obedience to\r\ngeneral rules in the economy of nature, which are for the most part\r\nbeyond our control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nTHEORIES RESPECTING THE ORIGINAL INTRODUCTION OF SPECIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Proposal of an hypothesis on this subject--Supposed centres or foci\r\n    of creation--Why distinct provinces of animals and plants have not\r\n    become more blended together--Brocchi's speculations on the loss of\r\n    species--Stations of plants and animals--Causes on which they\r\n    depend--Stations of plants how affected by animals--Equilibrium in\r\n    the number of species how preserved--Peculiar efficacy of insects in\r\n    this task--Rapidity with which certain insects multiply or decrease\r\n    in numbers--Effect of omnivorous animals in preserving the\r\n    equilibrium of species--Reciprocal influence of aquatic and\r\n    terrestrial species on each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Theory of Linnaeus._--It would be superfluous to examine the various\r\nattempts which were made to explain the phenomena of the distribution of\r\nspecies alluded to in the preceding chapters, in the infancy of the\r\nsciences of botany, zoology, and physical geography. The theories or\r\nrather conjectures then indulged now stand refuted by a simple statement\r\nof facts; and if Linnaeus were living he would be the first to renounce\r\nthe notions which he promulgated. For he imagined the habitable world to\r\nhave been for a certain time limited to one small tract, the only\r\nportion of the earth's surface that was as yet laid bare by the\r\nsubsidence of the primaeval ocean. In this fertile spot he supposed the\r\noriginals of all the species of plants which exist on this globe to have\r\nbeen congregated together with the first ancestors of all animals and of\r\nthe human race. \"In qua commode habitaverint animalia omnia, et\r\nvegetabilia laete germinaverint.\" In order to accommodate the various\r\nhabitudes of so many creatures, and to provide a diversity of climate\r\nsuited to their several natures, the tract in which the creation took\r\nplace was supposed to have been situated in some warm region of the\r\nearth, but to have contained a lofty mountain range, on the heights and\r\nin the declivities of which were to be found all temperatures and every\r\nclimate, from that of the torrid to that of the frozen zone.[948]\r\n\r\nThat there never was a universal ocean since the planet was inhabited,\r\nor, rather, since the oldest groups of strata yet known to contain\r\norganic remains were formed, is proved by the presence of terrestrial\r\nplants or by indications of shores in all the older formations; and if\r\nthis conclusion was not established, yet no geologist could deny that,\r\nsince the first small portion of the earth was laid dry, there have been\r\nmany entire changes in the species of plants and animals inhabiting the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nBut, without dwelling on the above and other refuted theories, let us\r\ninquire whether some hypothesis cannot be substituted as simple as that\r\nof Linnaeus, to which the phenomena now ascertained in regard to the\r\ndistribution both of aquatic and terrestrial species may be referred.\r\nThe following may, perhaps, be reconcileable with known facts:--Each\r\nspecies may have had its origin in a single pair, or individual, where\r\nan individual was sufficient, and species may have been created in\r\nsuccession at such times and in such places as to enable them to\r\nmultiply and endure for an appointed period, and occupy an appointed\r\nspace on the globe.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain this theory, let us suppose every living thing to be\r\ndestroyed in the western hemisphere, both on the land and in the ocean,\r\nand permission to be given to man to people this great desert, by\r\ntransporting into it animals and plants from the eastern hemisphere, a\r\nstrict prohibition being enforced against introducing two original\r\nstocks of the same species.\r\n\r\nNow it is easy to show that the result of such a mode of colonizing\r\nwould correspond exactly, so far as regards the grouping of animals and\r\nplants, with that now observed throughout the globe. In the first place,\r\nit would be necessary for naturalists, before they imported species into\r\nparticular localities, to study attentively the climate and other\r\nphysical conditions of each spot. It would be no less requisite to\r\nintroduce the different species in succession, so that each plant and\r\nanimal might have time and opportunity to multiply before the species\r\ndestined to prey upon it was admitted. Many herbs and shrubs, for\r\nexample, must spread far and wide before the sheep, the deer, and the\r\ngoat could be allowed to enter, lest they should devour and annihilate\r\nthe original stocks of many plants, and then perish themselves for want\r\nof food. The above-mentioned herbivorous animals in their turn must be\r\npermitted to make considerable progress before the entrance of the first\r\npair of wolves or lions. Insects must be allowed to swarm before the\r\nswallow could be permitted to skim through the air, and feast on\r\nthousands at one repast.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, however equally in this case our original stocks\r\nwere distributed over the whole surface of land and water, there would\r\nnevertheless arise distinct botanical and zoological provinces, for\r\nthere are a great many natural barriers which oppose common obstacles to\r\nthe advance of a variety of species. Thus, for example, almost all the\r\nanimals and plants naturalized by us, towards the extremity of South\r\nAmerica, would be unable to spread beyond a certain limit, towards the\r\neast, west, and south; because they would be stopped by the ocean, and a\r\nfew of them only would succeed in reaching the cooler latitudes of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, because they would be incapable of bearing the heat\r\nof the tropics, through which they must pass. In the course of ages,\r\nundoubtedly, exceptions would arise, and some species might become\r\ncommon to the temperate and polar regions, or both sides of the equator;\r\nfor I have before shown that the powers of diffusion conferred on some\r\nclasses are very great. But we might confidently predict that these\r\nexceptions would never become so numerous as to invalidate the general\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nSome of the plants and animals transplanted by us to the coast of Chili\r\nand Peru would never be able to cross the Andes, so as to reach the\r\neastern plains; nor, for a similar reason, would those first established\r\nin the Pampas, or the valleys of the Amazon and the Orinoco, ever arrive\r\nat the shores of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIn the ocean an analogous state of things would prevail; for there,\r\nalso, climate would exert a great influence in limiting the range of\r\nspecies, and the land would stop the migrations of aquatic tribes as\r\neffectually as the sea arrests the dispersion of the terrestrial. As\r\ncertain birds, insects, and the seeds of plants, can never cross the\r\ndirection of prevailing winds, so currents form natural barriers to the\r\ndissemination of many oceanic races. A line of shoals may be as\r\nimpassable to deep-water species, as are the Alps and the Andes to\r\nplants and animals peculiar to plains; while deep abysses may prove\r\ninsuperable obstacles to the migrations of the inhabitants of shallow\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n_Supposed centres, or foci, of creation._--It is worthy of observation,\r\nthat one effect of the introduction of single pairs of each species must\r\nbe the confined range of certain groups in spots, which, like small\r\nislands, or solitary inland lakes, have few means of interchanging their\r\ninhabitants with adjoining regions. Now this congregating in a small\r\nspace of many peculiar species, would give an appearance of _centres_ or\r\n_foci_ of creation, as they have been termed, as if they were favourite\r\npoints where the creative energy has been in greater action than in\r\nothers, and where the numbers of peculiar organic beings have\r\nconsequently become more considerable.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to call in question the soundness of the inferences of\r\nsome botanists, as to the former existence of certain limited spots\r\nwhence species of plants have been propagated, radiating, as it were, in\r\nall directions from a common centre. On the contrary, I conceive these\r\nphenomena to be the necessary consequences of the plan of nature before\r\nsuggested, operating during the successive mutations of the surface,\r\nsome of which the geologist can prove to have taken place subsequently\r\nto the period when many species now existing were created. In order to\r\nexemplify how this arrangement of plants may have been produced, let us\r\nimagine that, about three centuries before the discovery of St. Helena\r\n(itself of submarine volcanic origin), a multitude of new islands had\r\nbeen thrown up in the surrounding sea, and that these had each become\r\nclothed with plants emigrating from St. Helena, in the same manner as\r\nthe wild plants of Campania have diffused themselves over Monte Nuovo.\r\nWhenever the first botanist investigated the new archipelago, he would,\r\nin all probability, find a different assemblage of plants in each of the\r\nislands of recent formation; but in St. Helena itself, he would meet\r\nwith individuals of every species, belonging to all parts of the\r\narchipelago, and some, in addition, peculiar to itself, viz., those\r\nwhich had not been able to obtain a passage into any one of the\r\nsurrounding new-formed lands. In this case it might be truly said that\r\nthe original island was the primitive focus, or centre, of a certain\r\ntype of vegetation; whereas, in the surrounding islands, there would be\r\na smaller number of species, yet all belonging to the same group.\r\n\r\nBut this peculiar distribution of plants would not warrant the\r\nconclusion that, in the space occupied by St. Helena, there had been a\r\ngreater exertion of creative power than in the spaces of equal area\r\noccupied by the new adjacent lands; because, within the period in which\r\nSt. Helena had acquired its peculiar vegetation, each of the spots\r\nsupposed to be subsequently converted into land may have been the\r\nbirth-place of a great number of _marine_ animals and plants, which may\r\nhave had time to scatter themselves far and wide over the southern\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\n_Why distinct provinces not more blended._--Perhaps it may be objected\r\nto some parts of the foregoing train of reasoning, that during the lapse\r\nof past ages, especially during many partial revolutions of the globe of\r\ncomparatively modern date, different zoological and botanical provinces\r\nought to have become more confounded and blended together--that the\r\ndistribution of species approaches too nearly to what might have been\r\nexpected, if animals and plants had been introduced into the globe when\r\nits physical geography had already assumed the features which it now\r\nwears; whereas we know that, in certain districts, considerable\r\ngeographical changes have taken place since species identical with those\r\nnow in being were created.\r\n\r\n_Brocchi's speculations on loss of species._--These and many kindred\r\ntopics cannot be fully discussed until we have considered, not merely\r\nthe general laws which may regulate the first introduction of species,\r\nbut those which may limit their _duration_ on the earth. Brocchi\r\nremarked, when hazarding some interesting conjectures respecting \"the\r\nloss of species,\" that a modern naturalist had no small assurance, who\r\ndeclared \"that individuals alone were capable of destruction, and that\r\nspecies were so perpetuated that nature could not annihilate them, so\r\nlong as the planet lasted, or at least that nothing less than the shock\r\nof a comet, or some similar disaster, could put an end to their\r\nexistence.\"[949] The Italian geologist, on the contrary, had satisfied\r\nhimself that many species of Testacea, which formerly inhabited the\r\nMediterranean, had become extinct, although a great number of others,\r\nwhich had been the contemporaries of those lost races, still survived.\r\nHe came to the opinion that about half the species which peopled the\r\nwaters when the Subapennine strata were deposited had gone out of\r\nexistence; and in this inference he does not appear to have been far\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nBut, instead of seeking a solution of this problem; like some other\r\ngeologists of his time, in a violent and general catastrophe, Brocchi\r\nendeavoured to imagine some regular and constant law by which species\r\nmight be made to disappear from the earth gradually and in succession.\r\nThe death, he suggested, of a species might depend, like that of\r\nindividuals, on certain peculiarities of constitution conferred upon\r\nthem at their birth; and as the longevity of the one depends on a\r\ncertain force of vitality, which, after a period, grows weaker and\r\nweaker, so the duration of the other may be governed by the quantity of\r\nprolific power bestowed upon the species which, after a season, may\r\ndecline in energy, so that the fecundity and multiplication of\r\nindividuals may be gradually lessened from century to century, \"until\r\nthat fatal term arrives when the embryo, incapable of extending and\r\ndeveloping itself, abandons, almost at the instant of its formation, the\r\nslender principle of life by which it was scarcely animated,--and so all\r\ndies with it.\"\r\n\r\nNow we may coincide in opinion with the Italian naturalist, as to the\r\ngradual extinction of species one after another, by the operation of\r\nregular and constant causes, without admitting an inherent principle of\r\ndeterioration in their physiological attributes. We might concede, \"that\r\nmany species are on the decline, and that the day is not far distant\r\nwhen they will cease to exist;\" yet deem it consistent with what we know\r\nof the nature of organic beings, to believe that the last individuals of\r\neach species retain their prolific powers in their full intensity.\r\n\r\nBrocchi has himself speculated on the share which a change of climate\r\nmay have had in rendering the Mediterranean unfit for the habitation of\r\ncertain Testacea, which still continued to thrive in the Indian Ocean,\r\nand of others which were now only represented by analogous forms within\r\nthe tropics. He must also have been aware that other extrinsic causes,\r\nsuch as the progress of human population, or the increase of some one of\r\nthe inferior animals, might gradually lead to the extirpation of a\r\nparticular species, although its fecundity might remain to the last\r\nunimpaired. If, therefore, amid the vicissitudes of the animate and\r\ninanimate world, there are known causes capable of bringing about the\r\ndecline and extirpation of species, it became him thoroughly to\r\ninvestigate the full extent to which these might operate, before he\r\nspeculated on any cause of so purely hypothetical a kind as \"the\r\ndiminution of the prolific virtue.\"\r\n\r\nIf it could have been shown that some wild plant had insensibly dwindled\r\naway and died out, as sometimes happens to cultivated varieties\r\npropagated by cuttings, even though climate, soil, and every other\r\ncircumstance, should continue identically the same--if any animal had\r\nperished while the physical condition of the earth, and the number and\r\nforce of its foes, with every other extrinsic cause, remain unaltered,\r\nthen might we have some ground for suspecting that the infirmities of\r\nage creep on as naturally on species as upon individuals. But, in the\r\nabsence of such observations, let us turn to another class of facts, and\r\nexamine attentively the circumstances which determine the _stations_ of\r\nparticular animals and plants, and perhaps we shall discover, in the\r\nvicissitudes to which these stations are exposed, a cause fully adequate\r\nto explain the phenomena under consideration.\r\n\r\n_Stations of plants and animals._--Stations comprehend all the\r\ncircumstances, whether relating to the animate or inanimate world, which\r\ndetermine whether a given plant or animal can exist in a given place; so\r\nthat if it be shown that stations can become essentially modified by the\r\ninfluence of known causes, it will follow that species, as well as\r\nindividuals, are mortal.\r\n\r\nEvery naturalist is familiar with the fact, that although in a\r\nparticular country, such as Great Britain, there may be more than three\r\nthousand species of plants, ten thousand insects, and a great variety in\r\neach of the other classes; yet there will not be more than a hundred,\r\nperhaps not half that number, inhabiting any given locality. There may\r\nbe no want of space in the supposed tract: it may be a large mountain,\r\nor an extensive moor, or a great river plain, containing room enough for\r\nindividuals of every species in our island; yet the spot will be\r\noccupied by a few to the exclusion of many, and these few are enabled,\r\nthroughout long periods, to maintain their ground successfully against\r\nevery intruder, notwithstanding the facilities which species enjoy, by\r\nvirtue of their power of diffusion, of invading adjacent territories.\r\n\r\nThe principal causes which enable a certain assemblage of plants thus to\r\nmaintain their ground against all others depend, as is well known, on\r\nthe relations between the physiological nature of each species, and the\r\nclimate, exposure, soil, and other physical conditions of the locality.\r\nSome plants live only on rocks, others in meadows, a third class in\r\nmarshes. Of the latter, some delight in a fresh-water morass,--others in\r\nsalt marshes, where their roots may copiously absorb saline particles.\r\nSome prefer an alpine region in a warm latitude, where, during the heat\r\nof summer, they are constantly irrigated by the cool waters of melting\r\nsnows. To others loose sand, so fatal to the generality of species,\r\naffords the most proper station. The _Carex arenaria_ and the _Elymus\r\narenarius_ acquire their full vigor on a sandy dune, obtaining an\r\nascendancy over the very plants which in a stiff clay would immediately\r\nstifle them.\r\n\r\nWhere the soil of a district is of so peculiar a nature that it is\r\nextremely favorable to certain species, and agrees ill with every other,\r\nthe former get exclusive possession of the ground, and, as in the case\r\nof heaths, live in societies. In like manner the bog moss (_Sphagnum_)\r\nis fully developed in peaty swamps, and becomes, like the heath, in the\r\nlanguage of botanists, a social plant. Such monopolies, however, are not\r\ncommon, for they are checked by various causes. Not only are many\r\nspecies endowed with equal powers to obtain and keep possession of\r\nsimilar stations, but each plant, for reasons not fully explained by the\r\nphysiologist, has the property of rendering the soil where it has grown\r\nless fitted for the support of other individuals of its own species, or\r\neven other species of the same family. Yet the same spot, so far from\r\nbeing impoverished, is improved, for plants of _another_ family. Oaks,\r\nfor example, render the soil more fertile for the fir tribe, and firs\r\nprepare the soil for oaks. Every agriculturist feels the force of this\r\nlaw of the organic world, and regulates accordingly the rotation of his\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\n_Equilibrium in the number of species, how preserved._--\"All the plants\r\nof a given country,\" says De Candolle, in his usual spirited style, \"are\r\nat war one with another. The first which establish themselves by chance\r\nin a particular spot tend, by the mere occupancy of space, to exclude\r\nother species--the greater choke the smaller; the longest livers replace\r\nthose which last for a shorter period; the more prolific gradually make\r\nthemselves masters of the ground, which species multiplying more slowly\r\nwould otherwise fill.\"\r\n\r\nIn this continual strife it is not always the resources of the plant\r\nitself which enable it to maintain or extend its ground. Its success\r\ndepends, in a great measure, on the number of its foes or allies among\r\nthe animals and plants inhabiting the same region. Thus, for example, a\r\nherb which loves the shade may multiply, if some tree with spreading\r\nboughs and dense foliage flourish in the neighborhood. Another, which,\r\nif unassisted, would be overpowered by the rank growth of some hardy\r\ncompetitor, is secure because its leaves are unpalatable to cattle;\r\nwhich, on the other hand, annually crop down its antagonist, and rarely\r\nsuffer it to ripen its seed.\r\n\r\nOftentimes we see some herb which has flowered in the midst of a thorny\r\nshrub, when all the other individuals of the same species, in the open\r\nfields around, are eaten down, and cannot bring their seed to maturity.\r\nIn this case, the shrub has lent his armor of spines and prickles to\r\nprotect the defenceless herb against the mouths of the cattle, and thus\r\na few individuals which occupied, perhaps, the most unfavorable station\r\nin regard to exposure, soil, and other circumstances, may, nevertheless,\r\nby the aid of an ally, become the principal source whereby the winds are\r\nsupplied with seeds which perpetuate the species throughout the\r\nsurrounding tract. Thus, in the New Forest in Hampshire, the young oaks\r\nwhich are not consumed by the deer, or uprooted by the swine, are\r\nindebted to the holly for their escape.\r\n\r\nIn the above examples we see one plant shielding another from the\r\nattacks of animals; but instances are, perhaps, still more numerous,\r\nwhere some animal defends a plant against the enmity of some other\r\nsubject of the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nScarcely any beast, observes a Swedish naturalist, will touch the\r\nnettle, but fifty different kinds of insects are fed by it.[950] Some of\r\nthese seize upon the root, others upon the stem; some eat the leaves,\r\nothers devour the seeds and flowers; but for this multitude of enemies,\r\nthe nettle (_Urtica dioica_), which is now found in all the four\r\nquarters of the globe, would annihilate a great number of plants.\r\nLinnaeus tells us, in his \"Tour in Scania,\" that goats were turned into\r\nan island which abounded with the _Agrostis arundinacea_, where they\r\nperished by famine; but horses which followed them grew fat on the same\r\nplant. The goat, also, he says, thrives on the meadow-sweet and\r\nwater-hemlock, plants which are injurious to cattle.[951]\r\n\r\n_Agency of insects._--Every plant, observes Wilcke, has its proper\r\ninsect allotted to it to curb its luxuriancy, and to prevent it from\r\nmultiplying to the exclusion of others. \"Thus grass in meadows sometimes\r\nflourishes so as to exclude all other plants; here the Phalaena graminis\r\n(_Bombyx gram._), with her numerous progeny, finds a well-spread table;\r\nthey multiply in immense numbers, and the farmer, for some years,\r\nlaments the failure of his crop; but the grass being consumed, the moths\r\ndie with hunger, or remove to another place. Now the quantity of grass\r\nbeing greatly diminished, the other plants, which were before choked by\r\nit, spring up, and the ground becomes variegated with a multitude of\r\ndifferent species of flowers. Had not nature given a commission to this\r\nminister for that purpose, the grass would destroy a great number of\r\nspecies of vegetables, of which the equilibrium is now kept up.\"[952]\r\n\r\nIn the above passage allusion is made to the ravages committed in 1740,\r\nand the two following years, in many provinces of Sweden, by a most\r\ndestructive insect. The same moth is said never to touch the foxtail\r\ngrass, so that it may be classed as a most active ally and benefactor of\r\nthat species, and as peculiarly instrumental in preserving it in its\r\npresent abundance.[953] A discovery of Rolander, cited in the treatise\r\nof Wilcke above mentioned, affords a good illustration of the checks and\r\ncounter-checks which nature has appointed to preserve the balance of\r\npower among species. \"The _Phalaena strobilella_ has the fir cone\r\nassigned to it to deposit its eggs upon; the young caterpillars coming\r\nout of the shell consume the cone and superfluous seed; but, lest the\r\ndestruction should be too general, the _Ichneumon strobilellae_ lays its\r\neggs in the caterpillar, inserting its long tail in the openings of the\r\ncone till it touches the included insect, for its body is too large to\r\nenter. Thus it fixes its minute egg upon the caterpillar, which being\r\nhatched, destroys it.\"[954]\r\n\r\nEntomologists enumerate many parallel cases where insects, appropriated\r\nto certain plants, are kept down by other insects, and these again by\r\nparasites expressly appointed to prey on them.[955] Few perhaps are in\r\nthe habit of duly appreciating the extent to which insects are active in\r\npreserving the balance of species among plants, and thus regulating\r\nindirectly the relative numbers of many of the higher orders of\r\nterrestrial animals.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of their agency consists in their power of suddenly\r\nmultiplying their numbers to a degree which could only be accomplished\r\nin a considerable lapse of time in any of the larger animals, and then\r\nas instantaneously relapsing, without the intervention of any violent\r\ndisturbing cause, into their former insignificance.\r\n\r\nIf, for the sake of employing, on different but rare occasions, a power\r\nof many hundred horses, we were under the necessity of feeding all these\r\nanimals at great cost in the intervals when their services were not\r\nrequired, we should greatly admire the invention of a machine, such as\r\nthe steam-engine, which was capable at any moment of exerting the same\r\ndegree of strength without any consumption of food during periods of\r\ninaction. The same kind of admiration is strongly excited when we\r\ncontemplate the powers of insect life, in the creation of which the\r\nAuthor of nature has been so prodigal. A scanty number of minute\r\nindividuals, to be detected only by careful research, are ready in a few\r\ndays, weeks, or months, to give birth to myriads, which may repress any\r\ndegree of monopoly in another species, or remove nuisances, such as dead\r\ncarcases, which might taint the air. But no sooner has the destroying\r\ncommission been executed than the gigantic power becomes dormant--each\r\nof the mighty host soon reaches the term of its transient existence, and\r\nthe season arrives when the whole species passes naturally into the egg,\r\nand thence into the larva and pupa state. In this defenceless condition\r\nit may be destroyed either by the elements, or by the augmentation of\r\nsome of its numerous foes which may prey upon it in the early stages of\r\nits transformation: or it often happens that in the following year the\r\nseason proves unfavorable to the hatching of the eggs or the development\r\nof the pupae.\r\n\r\nThus the swarming myriads depart which may have covered the vegetation\r\nlike the aphides, or darkened the air like locusts. In almost every\r\nseason there are some species which in this manner put forth their\r\nstrength, and then, like Milton's spirits, which thronged the spacious\r\nhall, \"reduce to smallest forms their shapes immense\"--\r\n\r\n\r\n    ----So thick the aary crowd\r\n  Swarm'd and were straiten'd; till the signal given,\r\n  Behold a wonder! they but how who seem'd\r\n  In bigness to surpass earth's giant sons,\r\n  Now less than smallest dwarfs.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few examples will illustrate the mode in which this force operates. It\r\nis well known that, among the countless species of the insect creation,\r\nsome feed on animal, others on vegetable matter; and upon considering a\r\ncatalogue of eight thousand British Insects and Arachnidae, Mr. Kirby\r\nfound that these two divisions were nearly a counterpoise to each other,\r\nthe carnivorous being somewhat preponderant. There are also distinct\r\nspecies, some appointed to consume living, others dead or putrid animal\r\nand vegetable substances. One female, of _Musca carnaria_, will give\r\nbirth to twenty thousand young; and the larvae of many flesh-flies devour\r\nso much food in twenty-four hours, and grow so quickly, as to increase\r\ntheir weight two hundred-fold! In five days after being hatched they\r\narrive at their full growth and size, so that there was ground, says\r\nKirby, for the assertion of Linnaeus, that three flies of _M. vomitoria_\r\ncould devour a dead horse as quickly as a lion[956]; and another Swedish\r\nnaturalist remarks, that so great are the powers of propagation of a\r\nsingle species even of the smallest insects, that each can commit, when\r\nrequired, more ravages than the elephant.[957]\r\n\r\nNext to locusts, the aphides, perhaps, exert the greatest power over the\r\nvegetable world, and, like them, are so sometimes so numerous as to\r\ndarken the air. The multiplication of these little creatures is without\r\nparallel, and almost every plant has its peculiar species. Reaumur has\r\nproved that in five generations one aphis may be the progenitor of\r\n5,904,900,000 descendants; and it is supposed that in one year there may\r\nbe twenty generations.[958] Mr. Curtis observes that, as among\r\ncaterpillars we find some that are constantly and unalterably attached\r\nto one or more particular species of plants, and others that feed\r\nindiscriminately on most sorts of herbage, so it is precisely with the\r\naphides: some are particular, others more general feeders; and as they\r\nresemble other insects in this respect, so they do also in being more\r\nabundant in some years than in others.[959] In 1793 they were the chief,\r\nand in 1798 the sole, cause of the failure of the hops. In 1794, a\r\nseason, almost unparalleled for drought, the hop was perfectly free from\r\nthem; while peas and beans, especially the former, suffered very much\r\nfrom their depredations.\r\n\r\nThe ravages of the caterpillars of some of our smaller moths afford a\r\ngood illustration of the temporary increase of a species. The oak-trees\r\nof a considerable wood have been stripped of their leaves as bare as in\r\nwinter by the caterpillars of a small green moth (_Tortrix viridana_),\r\nwhich has been observed the year following not to abound.[960] The\r\nsilver Y moth (_Plusia gamma_), although one of our common species, is\r\nnot dreaded by us for its devastations; but legions of their\r\ncaterpillars have at times created alarm in France, as in 1735. Reaumur\r\nobserves that the female moth lays about four hundred eggs; so that if\r\ntwenty caterpillars were distributed in a garden, and all lived through\r\nthe winter and became moths in the succeeding May, the eggs laid by\r\nthese, if half of them were female and all fertile, would in the next\r\ngeneration produce 800,000 caterpillars.[961] A modern writer,\r\ntherefore, justly observes that, did not Providence put causes in\r\noperation to keep them in due bounds, the caterpillars of this moth\r\nalone, leaving out of consideration the two thousand other British\r\nspecies, might soon destroy more than half of our vegetation.[962]\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the last century an ant most destructive to the\r\nsugar-cane (_Formica saccharivora_), appeared in such infinite hosts in\r\nthe island of Granada, as to put a stop to the cultivation of that\r\nvegetable. Their numbers were incredible. The plantations and roads were\r\nfilled with them; many domestic quadrupeds, together with rats, mice,\r\nand reptiles, and even birds, perished in consequence of this plague. It\r\nwas not till 1780 that they were at length annihilated by torrents of\r\nrain, which accompanied a dreadful hurricane.[963]\r\n\r\n_Devastations caused by locusts._--We may conclude by mentioning some\r\ninstances of the devastations of locusts in various countries. Among\r\nother parts of Africa, Cyrenaica has been at different periods infested\r\nby myriads of these creatures, which have consumed nearly every green\r\nthing. The effect of the havoc committed by them may be estimated\r\nby the famine they occasioned. St. Augustin mentions a plague of this\r\nkind in Africa, which destroyed no less than 800,000 men in the kingdom\r\nof Massinissa alone, and many more upon the territories bordering upon\r\nthe sea. It is also related, that in the year 591 an infinite army of\r\nlocusts migrated from Africa into Italy; and, after grievously ravaging\r\nthe country, were cast into the sea, when there arose a pestilence from\r\ntheir stench, which carried off nearly a million of men and beasts.\r\n\r\nIn the Venetian territory, also, in 1748, more than thirty thousand\r\npersons are said to have perished in a famine occasioned by this\r\nscourge; and other instances are recorded of their devastations in\r\nFrance, Spain, Italy, Germany, &c. In different parts of Russia also,\r\nHungary, and Poland, in Arabia and India, and other countries, their\r\nvisitations have been periodically experienced. Although they have a\r\npreference for certain plants, yet, when these are consumed, they will\r\nattack almost all the remainder. In the accounts of the invasion of\r\nlocusts, the statements which appear most marvellous relate to the\r\nprodigious mass of matter which encumbers the sea wherever they are\r\nblown into it, and the pestilence arising from its putrefaction. Their\r\ndead bodies are said to have been, in some places, heaped one upon\r\nanother, to the depth of four feet, in Russia, Poland and Lithuania; and\r\nwhen, in Southern Africa, they were driven into the sea, by a north-west\r\nwind, they formed, says Barrow, along the shore, for fifty miles, a bank\r\nthree or four feet high.[964] But when we consider that forests are\r\nstripped of their foliage, and the earth of its green garment for\r\nthousands of square miles, it may well be supposed that the volume of\r\nanimal matter produced may equal that of great herds of quadrupeds and\r\nflights of large birds suddenly precipitated into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of such events, at certain intervals, in hot countries,\r\nlike the severe winters and damp summers returning after a series of\r\nyears in the temperate zone, may affect the proportional numbers of\r\nalmost all classes of animals and plants, and probably prove fatal to\r\nthe existence of many which would otherwise thrive there; while, on the\r\ncontrary, the same occurrences can scarcely fail to be favorable to\r\ncertain species which, if deprived of such aid, might not maintain their\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may usually be remarked that the extraordinary increase of\r\nsome one species is immediately followed and checked by the\r\nmultiplication of another, yet this does not always happen; partly\r\nbecause many species feed in common on the same kinds of food, and\r\npartly because many kinds of food are often consumed indifferently by\r\none and the same species. In the former case, where a variety of\r\ndifferent animals have precisely the same taste, as, for example, when\r\nmany insectivorous birds and reptiles devour alike some particular fly\r\nor beetle, the unusual numbers of these insects may cause only a slight\r\nand almost imperceptible augmentation of each of these species of bird\r\nand reptile. In the other instances, where one animal preys on others\r\nof almost every class, as for example, where our English buzzards devour\r\nnot only small quadrupeds, as rabbits and field-mice, but also birds,\r\nfrogs, lizards, and insects, the profusion of any one of these last may\r\ncause all such general feeders to subsist more exclusively upon the\r\nspecies thus in excess, by which means the balance may be restored.\r\n\r\n_Agency of omnivorous animals._--The number of species which are nearly\r\nomnivorous is considerable; and although every animal has, perhaps, a\r\npredilection for some one description of food rather than another, yet\r\nsome are not even confined to one of the great kingdoms of the organic\r\nworld. Thus, when the raccoon of the West Indies can procure neither\r\nfowls, fish, snails, nor insects, it will attack the sugar-canes, and\r\ndevour various kinds of grain. The civets, when animal food is scarce,\r\nmaintain themselves on fruits and roots.\r\n\r\nNumerous birds, which feed indiscriminately on insects and plants, are\r\nperhaps more instrumental than any other of the terrestrial tribes in\r\npreserving a constant equilibrium between the relative numbers of\r\ndifferent classes of animals and vegetables. If the insects become very\r\nnumerous and devour the plants, these birds will immediately derive a\r\nlarger portion of their subsistence from insects, just as the Arabians,\r\nSyrians, and Hottentots feed on locusts, when the locusts devour their\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\n_Reciprocal influence of aquatic and terrestrial species._--The intimate\r\nrelation of the inhabitants of the water to those of the land, and the\r\ninfluence exerted by each on the relative number of species, must not be\r\noverlooked amongst the complicated causes which determine the existence\r\nof animals and plants in certain regions. A large portion of the\r\namphibious quadrupeds and reptiles prey partly on aquatic plants and\r\nanimals, and in part on terrestrial; and a deficiency of one kind of\r\nprey causes them to have immediate recourse to the other. The voracity\r\nof certain insects, as the dragon-fly, for example, is confined to the\r\nwater during one stage of their transformations, and in their perfect\r\nstate to the air. Innumerable water-birds, both of rivers and seas,\r\nderive in like manner their food indifferently from either element; so\r\nthat the abundance or scarcity of prey in one induces them either to\r\nforsake or more constantly to haunt the other. Thus an intimate\r\nconnection between the state of the animate creation in a lake or river,\r\nand in the adjoining dry land, is maintained; or between a continent,\r\nwith its lakes and rivers, and the ocean. It is well known that many\r\nbirds migrate, during stormy seasons, from the sea-shore into the\r\ninterior, in search of food; while others, on the contrary, urged by\r\nlike wants, forsake their inland haunts, and live on substances rejected\r\nby the tide.\r\n\r\nThe migration of fish into rivers during the spawning season supplies\r\nanother link of the same kind. Suppose the salmon to be reduced in\r\nnumbers by some marine foes, as by seals and grampuses, the consequence\r\nmust often be, that in the course of a few years the otters at the\r\ndistance of several hundred miles inland will be lessened in number from\r\nthe scarcity of fish. On the other hand, if there be a dearth of food\r\nfor the young fry of the salmon in rivers and estuaries, so that few\r\nreturn to the sea, the sand eels and other marine species, which are\r\nusually kept down by the salmon, will swarm in greater profusion.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to accumulate a greater number of illustrations in\r\norder to prove that the stations of different plants and animals depend\r\non a great complication of circumstances,--on an immense variety of\r\nrelations in the state of the inanimate worlds. Every plant requires a\r\ncertain climate, soil, and other conditions, and often the aid of many\r\nanimals, in order to maintain its ground. Many animals feed on certain\r\nplants, being often restricted to a small number, and sometimes to one\r\nonly; other members of the animal kingdom feed on plant-eating species,\r\nand thus become dependent on the conditions of the _stations_ not only\r\nof their prey, but of the plants consumed by them.\r\n\r\nHaving duly reflected on the nature and extent of these mutual relations\r\nin the different parts of the organic and inorganic worlds, we may next\r\nproceed to examine the results which may be anticipated from the\r\nfluctuations now continually in progress in the state of the earth's\r\nsurface, and in the geographical distribution of its living productions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nEXTINCTION OF SPECIES.--CHANGES IN THE STATIONS OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Extension of the range of one species alters the condition of many\r\n    others--The first appearance of a new species causes the chief\r\n    disturbance--Changes known to have resulted from the advance of\r\n    human population--Whether man increases the productive powers of the\r\n    earth--Indigenous quadrupeds and birds extirpated in Great\r\n    Britain--Extinction of the dodo--Rapid propagation of domestic\r\n    quadrupeds in America--Power of exterminating species no prerogative\r\n    of man--Concluding remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the stations of animals and plants depend not merely\r\non the influence of external agents in the inanimate world, and the\r\nrelations of that influence to the structure and habits of each species,\r\nbut also on the state of the contemporary living beings which inhabit\r\nthe same part of the globe. In other words, the possibility of the\r\nexistence of a certain species in a given place, or of its thriving more\r\nor less therein, is determined not merely by temperature, humidity,\r\nsoil, elevation, and other circumstances of the like kind; but also by\r\nthe existence or non-existence, the abundance or scarcity, of a\r\nparticular assemblage of other plants and animals in the same region.\r\n\r\nIf it be shown that both these classes of circumstances, whether\r\nrelating to the animate or inanimate creation, are perpetually changing,\r\nit will follow that species are subject to incessant vicissitudes; and\r\nif the result of these mutations, in the course of ages, be so great as\r\nmaterially to affect the general condition of _stations_, it will follow\r\nthat the successive destruction of species must now be part of the\r\nregular and constant order of nature.\r\n\r\n_Extension of the range of one species alters the condition of the\r\nothers._--It will be desirable, first, to consider the effects which\r\nevery extension of the numbers or geographical range of one species must\r\nproduce on the condition of others inhabiting the same regions. When the\r\nnecessary consequences of such extensions have been fully explained, the\r\nreader will be prepared to appreciate the important influence which\r\nslight modifications in the physical geography of the globe may exert on\r\nthe condition of organic beings.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is clear that when any region is stocked with as\r\ngreat a variety of animals and plants as the productive powers of that\r\nregion will enable it to support, the addition of any new species, or\r\nthe _permanent_ numerical increase of one previously established, must\r\nalways be attended either by the local extermination or the numerical\r\ndecrease of some other species.\r\n\r\nThere may undoubtedly be considerable fluctuations from year to year,\r\nand the equilibrium may be again restored without any permanent\r\nalteration; for, in particular seasons, a greater supply of heat,\r\nhumidity, or other causes, may augment the total quantity of vegetable\r\nproduce, in which case all the animals subsisting on vegetable food, and\r\nothers which prey on them, may multiply without any one species giving\r\nway: but whilst the aggregate quantity of vegetable produce remains\r\nunaltered, the progressive increase of one animal or plant implies the\r\ndecline of another.\r\n\r\nAll agriculturists and gardeners are familiar with the fact that when\r\nweeds intrude themselves into the space appropriated to cultivated\r\nspecies, the latter are starved in their growth, or stifled. If we\r\nabandon for a short time a field or garden, a host of indigenous plants,\r\n\r\n\r\n  The darnel, hemlock, and rank fumitory,\r\n\r\n\r\npour in and obtain the mastery, extirpating the exotics, or putting an\r\nend to the monopoly of some native plants.\r\n\r\nIf we inclose a park, and stock it with as many deer as the herbage will\r\nsupport, we cannot add sheep without lessening the number of the deer;\r\nnor can other herbivorous species be subsequently introduced, unless the\r\nindividuals of each species in the park become fewer in proportion.\r\n\r\nSo, if there be an island where leopards are the only beasts of prey,\r\nand the lion, tiger, and hyaena afterwards enter, the leopards, if they\r\nstand their ground, will be reduced in number. If the locusts then\r\narrive and swarm greatly, they may deprive a large number of\r\nplant-eating animals of their food, and thereby cause a famine, not only\r\namong them, but among the beasts of prey: certain species perhaps, which\r\nhad the weakest footing in the island, may thus be annihilated.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how many distinct geographical provinces there are of\r\naquatic and terrestrial species, and how great are the powers of\r\nmigration conferred on different classes, whereby the inhabitants of one\r\nregion may be enabled from time to time to invade another, and do\r\nactually so migrate and diffuse themselves over new countries. Now,\r\nalthough our knowledge of the history of the animate creation dates from\r\nso recent a period, that we can scarcely trace the advance or decline of\r\nany animal or plant, except in those cases where the influence of man\r\nhas intervened; yet we can easily conceive what must happen when some\r\nnew colony of wild animals or plants enters a region for the first time,\r\nand succeeds in establishing itself.\r\n\r\n_Supposed effects of the first entrance of the polar bear into\r\nIceland._--Let us consider how great are the devastations committed at\r\ncertain periods by the Greenland bears, when they are drifted to the\r\nshores of Iceland in considerable numbers on the ice. These periodical\r\ninvasions are formidable even to man; so that when the bears arrive, the\r\ninhabitants collect together, and go in pursuit of them with\r\nfire-arms--each native who slays one being rewarded by the King of\r\nDenmark. The Danes of old, when they landed in their marauding\r\nexpeditions upon our coast, hardly excited more alarm, nor did our\r\nislanders muster more promptly for the defence of their lives and\r\nproperty against the common enemy, than the modern Icelanders against\r\nthese formidable brutes. It often happens, says Henderson, that the\r\nnatives are pursued by the bear when he has been long at sea, and when\r\nhis natural ferocity has been heightened by the keenness of hunger; if\r\nunarmed, it is frequently by stratagem only that they make their\r\nescape.[965]\r\n\r\nLet us cast our thoughts back to the period when the first polar bears\r\nreached Iceland, before it was colonized by the Norwegians in 874: we\r\nmay imagine the breaking up of an immense barrier of ice like that\r\nwhich, in 1816 and the following year, disappeared from the east coast\r\nof Greenland, which it had surrounded for four centuries. By the aid of\r\nsuch means of transportation a great number of these quadrupeds might\r\neffect a landing at the same time, and the havoc which they would make\r\namong the species previously settled in the island would be terrific.\r\nThe deer, foxes, seals, and even birds, on which these animals sometimes\r\nprey, would be soon thinned down.\r\n\r\nBut this would be a part only, and probably an insignificant portion, of\r\nthe aggregate amount of change brought about by the new invader. The\r\nplants on which the deer fed, being less consumed in consequence of the\r\nlessened numbers of that herbivorous species, would soon supply more\r\nfood to several insects, and probably to some terrestrial testacea, so\r\nthat the latter would gain ground. The increase of these would furnish\r\nother insects and birds with food, so that the numbers of these last\r\nwould be augmented. The diminution of the seals would afford a respite\r\nto some fish which they had persecuted; and these fish, in their turn,\r\nwould then multiply and press upon their peculiar prey. Many\r\nwater-fowls, the eggs and young of which are devoured by foxes, would\r\nincrease when the foxes were thinned down by the bears; and the fish on\r\nwhich the water-fowls subsisted would then, in their turn, be less\r\nnumerous. Thus the numerical proportions of a great number of the\r\ninhabitants, both of the land and sea, might be permanently altered by\r\nthe settling of one new species in the region; and the changes caused\r\nindirectly would ramify through all classes of the living creation, and\r\nbe almost endless.\r\n\r\nAn actual illustration of what we have here only proposed\r\nhypothetically, is in some degree afforded by the selection of small\r\nislands by the eider duck for its residence during the season of\r\nincubation, its nest being seldom if ever found on the shores of the\r\nmain land, or even of a large island. The Icelanders are so well aware\r\nof this, that they have expended a great deal of labor in forming\r\nartificial islands, by separating from the main land certain\r\npromontories, joined to it by narrow isthmuses. This insular position is\r\nnecessary to guard against the destruction of the eggs and young birds,\r\nby foxes, dogs, and other animals. One year, says Hooker, it happened\r\nthat, in the small island of Vidoe, adjoining the coast of Iceland, a\r\nfox got over _upon the ice_, and caused great alarm, as an immense\r\nnumber of ducks were then sitting on their eggs or young ones. It was\r\nlong before he was taken, which was at last, however, effected by\r\nbringing another fox to the island, and fastening it by a string near\r\nthe haunt of the former, by which he was allured within shot of the\r\nhunter.[966]\r\n\r\n_The first appearance of a new species causes the chief\r\ndisturbance._--It is usually the first appearance of an animal or plant,\r\nin a region to which it was previously a stranger, that gives rise to\r\nthe chief alteration; since, after a time, an equilibrium is again\r\nestablished. But it must require ages before such a new adjustment of\r\nthe relative forces of so many conflicting agents can be definitely\r\nsettled. The causes in simultaneous action are so numerous, that they\r\nadmit of an almost infinite number of combinations; and it is necessary\r\nthat all these should have occurred once before the total amount of\r\nchange, capable of flowing from any new disturbing force, can be\r\nestimated.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, suppose that once in two centuries a frost of unusual\r\nintensity, or a volcanic eruption of great violence accompanied by\r\nfloods from the melting of glaciers, should occur in Iceland; or an\r\nepidemic disease, fatal to the larger number of individuals of some one\r\nspecies, and not affecting others,--these, and a variety of other\r\ncontingencies, all of which may occur at once, or at periods separated\r\nby different intervals of time, ought to happen before it would be\r\npossible for us to declare what ultimate alteration the presence of any\r\nnew comer, such as the bear before mentioned, might occasion in the\r\nanimal population of the isle.\r\n\r\nEvery new condition in the state of the organic or inorganic creation, a\r\nnew animal or plant, an additional snow-clad mountain, any permanent\r\nchange, however slight in comparison to the whole, gives rise to a new\r\norder of things, and may make a material change in regard to some one or\r\nmore species. Yet a swarm of locusts, or a frost of extreme intensity,\r\nor an epidemic disease, may pass away without any great apparent\r\nderangement; no species may be lost, and all may soon recover their\r\nformer relative numbers, because the same scourges may have visited the\r\nregion again and again, at preceding periods. Every plant that was\r\nincapable of resisting such a degree of cold, every animal which was\r\nexposed to be entirely cut off by an epidemic or by famine caused by the\r\nconsumption of vegetation by the locusts, may have perished already, so\r\nthat the subsequent recurrence of similar catastrophes is attended only\r\nby a temporary change.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Changes caused by Man_\r\n\r\nWe are best acquainted with the mutations brought about by the progress\r\nof human population, and the growth of plants and animals favored by\r\nman. To these, therefore, we should in the first instance turn our\r\nattention. If we conclude, from the concurrent testimony of history and\r\nof the evidence yielded by geological data, that man is, comparatively\r\nspeaking, of very modern origin, we must at once perceive how great a\r\nrevolution in the state of the animate world the increase of the human\r\nrace, considered merely as consumers of a certain quantity of organic\r\nmatter, must necessarily cause.\r\n\r\n_Whether man increases the productive powers of the earth._--It may\r\nperhaps, be said, that man has, in some degree, compensated for the\r\nappropriation to himself of so much food, by artificially improving the\r\nnatural productiveness of soils, by irrigation, manure, and a judicious\r\nintermixture of mineral ingredients conveyed from different localities.\r\nBut it admits of reasonable doubt whether, upon the whole, we fertilize\r\nor impoverish the lands which we occupy. This assertion may seem\r\nstartling to many; because they are so much in the habit of regarding\r\nthe sterility or productiveness of land in relation to the wants of man,\r\nand not as regards the organic world generally. It is difficult, at\r\nfirst, to conceive, if a morass is converted into arable land, and made\r\nto yield a crop of grain, even of moderate abundance, that we have not\r\nimproved the capabilities of the habitable surface--that we have not\r\nempowered it to support a larger quantity of organic life. In such\r\ncases, however, a tract, before of no utility to man, may be reclaimed,\r\nand become of high agricultural importance, though it may, nevertheless,\r\nyield a scantier vegetation. If a lake be drained, and turned into a\r\nmeadow, the space will provide sustenance to man, and many terrestrial\r\nanimals serviceable to him, but not, perhaps, so much food as it\r\npreviously yielded to the aquatic races.\r\n\r\nIf the pestiferous Pontine marshes were drained, and covered with corn,\r\nlike the plains of the Po, they might, perhaps, feed a smaller number of\r\nanimals than they do now; for these morasses are filled with herds of\r\nbuffaloes and swine, and they swarm with birds, reptiles, and insects.\r\n\r\nThe felling of dense and lofty forests, which covered, even within the\r\nrecords of history, a considerable space on the globe, now tenanted by\r\ncivilized man, must generally have lessened the amount of vegetable food\r\nthroughout the space where these woods grew. We must also take into our\r\naccount the area covered by towns, and a still larger surface occupied\r\nby roads.\r\n\r\nIf we force the soil to bear extraordinary crops one year, we are,\r\nperhaps, compelled to let it lie fallow the next. But nothing so much\r\ncounterbalances the fertilizing effects of human art as the extensive\r\ncultivation of foreign herbs and shrubs, which, although they are often\r\nmore nutritious to man, seldom thrive with the same rank luxuriance as\r\nthe native plants of a district. Man is, in truth, continually striving\r\nto diminish the natural diversity of the _stations_ of animals and\r\nplants in every country, and to reduce them all to a small number fitted\r\nfor species of economical use. He may succeed perfectly in attaining his\r\nobject, even though the vegetation be comparatively meagre, and the\r\ntotal amount of animal life be greatly lessened.\r\n\r\nSpix and Martius have given a lively description of the incredible\r\nnumber of insects which lay waste the crops in Brazil, besides swarms of\r\nmonkeys, flocks of parrots, and other birds, as well as the paca,\r\nagouti, and wild swine. They describe the torment which the planter and\r\nthe naturalist suffer from the musquitoes, and the devastation of the\r\nants and blattae; they speak of the dangers to which they were exposed\r\nfrom the jaguar, the poisonous serpents, crocodiles, scorpions,\r\ncentipedes, and spiders. But with the increasing population and\r\ncultivation of the country, say these naturalists, these evils will\r\ngradually diminish; when the inhabitants have cut down the woods,\r\ndrained the marshes, made roads in all directions, and founded villages\r\nand towns, man will, by degrees, triumph over the rank vegetation and\r\nthe noxious animals, and all the elements will second and amply\r\nrecompense his activity.[967]\r\n\r\nThe number of human beings now peopling the earth is supposed to amount\r\nto eight hundred millions, so that we may easily understand how great a\r\nnumber of beasts of prey, birds, and animals of every class, this\r\nprodigious population must have displaced, independently of the still\r\nmore important consequences which have followed from the derangement\r\nbrought about by man in the relative numerical strength of particular\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n_Indigenous quadrupeds and birds extirpated in Great Britain._--Let us\r\nmake some inquiries into the extent of the influence which the progress\r\nof society has exerted during the last seven or eight centuries, in\r\naltering the distribution of indigenous British animals. Dr. Fleming has\r\nprosecuted this inquiry with his usual zeal and ability; and in a memoir\r\non the subject has enumerated the best-authenticated examples of the\r\ndecrease or extirpation of certain species during a period when our\r\npopulation has made the most rapid advances. I shall offer a brief\r\noutline of his results.[968]\r\n\r\nThe stag, as well as the fallow deer and the roe, were formerly so\r\nabundant in our island, that, according to Lesley, from five hundred to\r\na thousand were sometimes slain at a hunting match; but the native races\r\nwould already have been extinguished, had they not been carefully\r\npreserved in certain forests. The otter, the marten, and the polecat,\r\nwere also in sufficient numbers to be pursued for the sake of their fur;\r\nbut they have now been reduced within very narrow bounds. The wild cat\r\nand fox have also been sacrificed throughout the greater part of the\r\ncountry, for the security of the poultry-yard or the fold. Badgers have\r\nbeen expelled from nearly every district, which at former periods they\r\ninhabited.\r\n\r\nBesides these, which have been driven out from their favorite haunts,\r\nand everywhere reduced in number, there are some which have been wholly\r\nextirpated; such as the ancient breed of indigenous horses, and the wild\r\nboar; of the wild oxen a few remains are still preserved in some of the\r\nold English parks. The beaver, which is eagerly sought after for its\r\nfur, had become scarce at the close of the ninth century; and, by the\r\ntwelfth century, was only to be met with, according to Giraldus de\r\nBarri, in one river in Wales, and another in Scotland. The wolf, once so\r\nmuch dreaded by our ancestors, is said to have maintained its ground in\r\nIreland so late as the beginning of the eighteenth century (1710),\r\nthough it had been extirpated in Scotland thirty years before, and in\r\nEngland at a much earlier period. The bear, which, in Wales, was\r\nregarded as a beast of the chase equal to the hare or the boar[969],\r\nonly perished, as a native of Scotland, in the year 1057.[970]\r\n\r\nMany native birds of prey have also been the subjects of unremitting\r\npersecution. The eagles, larger hawks, and ravens, have disappeared from\r\nthe more cultivated districts. The haunts of the mallard, the snipe, the\r\nredshank, and the bittern, have been drained equally with the summer\r\ndwellings of the lapwing and the curlew. But these species still linger\r\nin some portion of the British isles; whereas the larger capercailzies\r\nor wood grouse, formerly natives of the pine-forests of Ireland and\r\nScotland, have been destroyed within the last sixty years. The egret and\r\nthe crane, which appear to have been formerly very common in Scotland,\r\nare now only occasional visitants.[971]\r\n\r\nThe bustard (_Otis tarda_), observes Graves, in his British\r\nOrnithology[972], \"was formerly seen in the downs and heaths of various\r\nparts of our island, in flocks of forty or fifty birds; whereas it is\r\nnow a circumstance of rare occurrence to meet with a single individual.\"\r\nBewick also remarks, \"that they were formerly more common in this island\r\nthan at present; they are now found only in the open counties of the\r\nsouth and east--in the plains of Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, and some parts\r\nof Yorkshire.\"[973] In the few years that have elapsed since Bewick\r\nwrote, this bird has entirely disappeared from Wiltshire and\r\nDorsetshire.\r\n\r\nThese changes, it may be observed, are derived from very imperfect\r\nmemorials, and relate only to the larger and more conspicuous animals\r\ninhabiting a small spot on the globe; but they cannot fail to exalt our\r\nconception of the enormous revolutions which, in the course of several\r\nthousand years, the whole human species must have effected.\r\n\r\n_Extinction of the dodo._--The kangaroo and the emu are retreating\r\nrapidly before the progress of colonization in Australia; and it\r\nscarcely admits of doubt, that the general cultivation of that country\r\nmust lead to the extirpation of both. The most striking example of the\r\nloss, even within the last two centuries, of a remarkable species, is\r\nthat of the dodo--a bird first seen by the Dutch, when they landed on\r\nthe Isle of France, at that time uninhabited, immediately after the\r\ndiscovery of the passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope. It\r\nwas of a large size, and singular form; its wings short, like those of\r\nan ostrich, and wholly incapable of sustaining its heavy body, even for\r\na short flight. In its general appearance it differed from the ostrich,\r\ncassowary, or any known bird.[974]\r\n\r\nMany naturalists gave figures of the dodo after the commencement of the\r\nseventeenth century; and there is a painting of it in the British\r\nMuseum, which is said to have been taken from a living individual.\r\nBeneath the painting is a leg, in a fine state of preservation, which\r\nornithologists are agreed cannot belong to any other known bird. In the\r\nmuseum at Oxford, also, there is a foot and a head in an imperfect\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the most active search, during the last century, no\r\ninformation respecting the dodo was obtained, and some authors have gone\r\nso far as to pretend that it never existed; but a great mass of\r\nsatisfactory evidence in favor of its recent existence has now been\r\ncollected by Mr. Broderip,[975] and by Mr. Strickland and Dr. Melville.\r\nMr. Strickland, agreeing with Professor Reinhardt, of Copenhagen, in\r\nreferring the dodo to the Columbidae, calls it a \"vulture-like\r\nfrugivorous pigeon.\" It appears, also, that another short-winged bird of\r\nthe same order, called \"The Solitaire,\" inhabited the small island of\r\nRodrigues, 300 miles east of the Mauritius, and has been exterminated by\r\nman, as have one or two different but allied birds of the Isle of\r\nBourbon.[976]\r\n\r\n_Rapid propagation of domestic quadrupeds over the American\r\ncontinent._--Next to the direct agency of man, his indirect influence in\r\nmultiplying the numbers of large herbivorous quadrupeds of domesticated\r\nraces may be regarded as one of the most obvious causes of the\r\nextermination of species. On this, and on several other grounds, the\r\nintroduction of the horse, ox, and other mammalia, into America, and\r\ntheir rapid propagation over that continent within the last three\r\ncenturies, is a fact of great importance in natural history. The\r\nextraordinary herds of wild cattle and horses which overran the plains\r\nof South America sprung from a very few pairs first carried over by the\r\nSpaniards; and they prove that the wide geographical range of large\r\nspecies in great continents does not necessarily imply that they have\r\nexisted there from remote periods.\r\n\r\nHumboldt observes, in his Travels, on the authority of Azzara, that it\r\nis believed there exist, in the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, twelve million\r\ncows and three million horses, without comprising, in this enumeration,\r\nthe cattle that have no acknowledged proprietor. In the Llanos of\r\nCaraccas, the rich hateros, or proprietors of pastoral farms, are\r\nentirely ignorant of the number of cattle they possess. The young are\r\nbranded with a mark peculiar to each herd, and some of the most wealthy\r\nowners mark as many as fourteen thousand a year.[977] In the northern\r\nplains, from the Orinoco to the lake of Maraycabo, M. Depons reckoned\r\nthat 1,200,000 oxen, 180,000 horses, and 90,000 mules, wandered at\r\nlarge.[978] In some parts of the valley of the Mississippi, especially\r\nin the country of the Osage Indians, wild horses are immensely numerous.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of black cattle in America dates from Columbus's\r\nsecond voyage to St. Domingo. They there multiplied rapidly; and that\r\nisland presently became a kind of nursery from which these animals were\r\nsuccessively transported to various parts of the continental coast, and\r\nfrom thence into the interior. Notwithstanding these numerous\r\nexportations, in twenty-seven years after the discovery of the island,\r\nherds of four thousand head, as we learn from Oviedo, were not uncommon,\r\nand there were even some that amounted to eight thousand. In 1587, the\r\nnumber of hides exported from St. Domingo alone, according to Acosta's\r\nreport, was 35,444; and in the same year there were exported 64,350 from\r\nthe ports of New Spain. This was in the sixty-fifth year after the\r\ntaking of Mexico, previous to which event the Spaniards, who came into\r\nthat country, had not been able to engage in anything else than\r\nwar.[979] Every one is aware that these animals are now established\r\nthroughout the American continent from Canada to the Straits of\r\nMagellan.\r\n\r\nThe ass has thriven very generally in the New World; and we learn from\r\nUlloa, that in Quito they ran wild, and multiplied in amazing numbers,\r\nso as to become a nuisance. They grazed together in herds, and when\r\nattacked defended themselves with their mouths. If a horse happened to\r\nstray into the places where they fed, they all fell upon him, and did\r\nnot cease biting and kicking till they left him dead.[980]\r\n\r\nThe first hogs were carried to America by Columbus, and established in\r\nthe Island of St. Domingo the year following its discovery, in November,\r\n1493. In succeeding years they were introduced into other places where\r\nthe Spaniards settled; and, in the space of half a century, they were\r\nfound established in the New World, from the latitude of 25 degrees\r\nnorth, to the 40th degree of south latitude. Sheep, also, and goats have\r\nmultiplied enormously in the New World, as have also the cat and the\r\nrat; which last, as before stated, has been imported unintentionally in\r\nships. The dogs introduced by man which have at different periods become\r\nwild in America, hunted in packs, like the wolf and the jackall,\r\ndestroying not only hogs, but the calves and foals of the wild cattle\r\nand horses.\r\n\r\nUlloa in his voyage, and Buffon on the authority of old writers, relate\r\na fact which illustrates very clearly the principle before explained, of\r\nthe check which the increase of one animal necessarily offers to that of\r\nanother. The Spaniards had introduced goats into the Island of Juan\r\nFernandez, where they became so prolific as to furnish the pirates who\r\ninfested those seas with provisions. In order to cut off this resource\r\nfrom the buccaneers, a number of dogs were turned loose into the island;\r\nand so numerous did they become in their turn, that they destroyed the\r\ngoats in every accessible part, after which the number of the wild dogs\r\nagain decreased.[981]\r\n\r\n_Increase of rein-deer imported into Iceland._--As an example of the\r\nrapidity with which a large tract may become peopled by the offspring of\r\na single pair of quadrupeds, it may be mentioned that in the year 1773\r\nthirteen rein-deer were exported from Norway, only three of which\r\nreached Iceland. These were turned loose into the mountains of\r\nGuldbringe Syssel, where they multiplied so greatly, in the course of\r\nforty years, that it was not uncommon to meet with herds, consisting of\r\nfrom forty to one hundred, in various districts.\r\n\r\nThe rein-deer, observes a modern writer, is in Lapland a loser by his\r\nconnexion with man, but Iceland will be this creature's paradise. There\r\nis, in the interior, a tract which Sir. G. Mackenzie computes at not\r\nless than forty thousand square miles, without a single human\r\nhabitation, and almost entirely unknown to the natives themselves. There\r\nare no wolves: the Icelanders will keep out the bears; and the\r\nreindeer, being almost unmolested by man, will have no enemy whatever,\r\nunless it has brought with it its own tormenting gad-fly.[982]\r\n\r\nBesides the quadrupeds before enumerated, our domestic fowls have also\r\nsucceeded in the West Indies and America, where they have the common\r\nfowl, the goose, the duck, the peacock, the pigeon, and the guinea-fowl.\r\nAs these were often taken suddenly from the temperate to very hot\r\nregions, they were not reared at first without much difficulty: but\r\nafter a few generations, they became familiarized to the climate, which,\r\nin many cases, approached much nearer than that of Europe to the\r\ntemperature of their original native countries.\r\n\r\nThe fact of so many millions of wild and tame individuals of our\r\ndomestic species, almost all of them the largest quadrupeds and birds,\r\nhaving been propagated throughout the new continent within the short\r\nperiod that has elapsed since the discovery of America, while no\r\nappreciable improvement can have been made in the productive powers of\r\nthat vast continent, affords abundant evidence of the extraordinary\r\nchanges which accompany the diffusion and progressive advancement of the\r\nhuman race over the globe. That it should have remained for us to\r\nwitness such mighty revolutions is a proof, even if there was no other\r\nevidence, that the entrance of man into the planet is, comparatively\r\nspeaking, of extremely modern date, and that the effects of his agency\r\nare only beginning to be felt.\r\n\r\n_Population which the globe is capable of supporting._--A modern writer\r\nhas estimated, that there are in America upwards of four million square\r\nmiles of useful soil, each capable of supporting 200 persons; and nearly\r\nsix million, each mile capable of supporting 490 persons.[983] If this\r\nconjecture be true, it will follow, as that author observes, that if the\r\nnatural resources of America were fully developed, it would afford\r\nsustenance to five times as great a number of inhabitants as the entire\r\nmass of human beings existing at present upon the globe. The new\r\ncontinent, he thinks, though less than half the size of the old,\r\ncontains an equal quantity of useful soil, and much more than an equal\r\namount of productive power. Be this as it may, we may safely conclude\r\nthat the amount of human population now existing constitutes but a small\r\nproportion of that which the globe is capable of supporting, or which it\r\nis destined to sustain at no distant period, by the rapid progress of\r\nsociety, especially in America, Australia, and certain parts of the old\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n_Power of exterminating species no prerogative of man._--But if we\r\nreflect that many millions of square miles of the most fertile land,\r\noccupied originally by a boundless variety of animal and vegetable\r\nforms, have been already brought under the dominion of man, and\r\ncompelled, in a great measure, to yield nourishment to him, and to a\r\nlimited number of plants and animals which he has caused to increase, we\r\nmust at once be convinced, that the annihilation of a multitude of\r\nspecies has already been effected, and will continue to go on hereafter,\r\nin certain regions, in a still more rapid ratio, as the colonies of\r\nhighly civilized nations spread themselves over unoccupied lands.\r\n\r\nYet, if we wield the sword of extermination as we advance, we have no\r\nreason to repine at the havoc committed, nor to fancy, with the Scottish\r\npoet, that \"we violate the social union of nature;\" or complain, with\r\nthe melancholy Jacques, that we\r\n\r\n\r\n  Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,\r\n  To fright the animals and to kill them up\r\n  In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have only to reflect, that in thus obtaining possession of the earth\r\nby conquest, and defending our acquisitions by force, we exercise no\r\nexclusive prerogative. Every species which has spread itself from a\r\nsmall point over a wide area must, in like manner, have marked its\r\nprogress by the diminution or the entire extirpation of some other, and\r\nmust maintain its ground by a successful struggle against the\r\nencroachments of other plants and animals. That minute parasitic plant,\r\ncalled \"the rust\" in wheat, has, like the Hessian fly, the locust, and\r\nthe aphis, caused famines ere now amongst the \"lords of the creation.\"\r\nThe most insignificant and diminutive species, whether in the animal or\r\nvegetable kingdom, have each slaughtered their thousands, as they\r\ndisseminated themselves over the globe, as well as the lion, when first\r\nit spread itself over the tropical regions of Africa.\r\n\r\n_Concluding remarks._--Although we have as yet considered one class only\r\nof the causes (the organic) by which species may become exterminated,\r\nyet it cannot but appear evident that the continued action of these\r\nalone, throughout myriads of future ages, must work an entire change in\r\nthe state of the organic creation, not merely on the continents and\r\nislands, where the power of man is chiefly exerted, but in the great\r\nocean, where his control is almost unknown. The mind is prepared by the\r\ncontemplation of such future revolutions to look for the signs of\r\nothers, of an analogous nature, in the monuments of the past. Instead of\r\nbeing astonished at the proofs there manifested of endless mutations in\r\nthe animate world, they will appear to one who has thought profoundly on\r\nthe fluctuations now in progress, to afford evidence in favor of the\r\nuniformity of the system, unless, indeed, we are precluded from speaking\r\nof _uniformity_ when we characterize a principle of endless variation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nEXTINCTION OF SPECIES.--INFLUENCE OF INORGANIC CAUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Powers of diffusion indispensable, that each species may maintain\r\n    its ground--How changes in physical geography affect the\r\n    distribution of species--Rate of the change of species due to this\r\n    cause cannot be uniform--Every change in the physical geography of\r\n    large regions tends to the extinction of species--Effects of a\r\n    general alteration of climate on the migration of species--Gradual\r\n    refrigeration would cause species in the northern and southern\r\n    hemispheres to become distinct--Elevation of temperature the\r\n    reverse--Effects on the condition of species which must result from\r\n    inorganic changes inconsistent with the theory of transmutation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Powers of diffusion indispensable, that each species may maintain its\r\nground._--Having shown in the last chapter, how considerably the\r\nnumerical increase or the extension of the geographical range of any one\r\nspecies must derange the numbers and distribution of others, let us now\r\ndirect our attention to the influence which the inorganic causes\r\ndescribed in the second book are continually exerting on the habitations\r\nof species.\r\n\r\nSo great is the instability of the earth's surface, that if nature were\r\nnot continually engaged in the task of sowing seeds and colonizing\r\nanimals, the depopulation of a certain portion of the habitable sea and\r\nland would in a few years be considerable. Whenever a river transports\r\nsediment into a lake or sea, so as materially to diminish its depth, the\r\naquatic animals and plants which delight in deep water are expelled: the\r\ntract, however, is not allowed to remain useless; but is soon peopled by\r\nspecies which require more light and heat, and thrive where the water is\r\nshallow. Every addition made to the land by the encroachment of the\r\ndelta of a river banishes many subaqueous species from their native\r\nabodes; but the new-formed plain is not permitted to lie unoccupied,\r\nbeing instantly covered with terrestrial vegetation. The ocean devours\r\ncontinuous lines of sea-coasts, and precipitates forests or rich pasture\r\nland into the waves: but this space is not lost to the animate creation;\r\nfor shells and sea-weeds soon adhere to the new-made cliffs, and\r\nnumerous fish people the channel which the current has scooped out for\r\nitself. No sooner has a volcanic island been thrown up than some lichens\r\nbegin to grow upon it, and it is sometimes clothed with verdure while\r\nsmoke and ashes are still occasionally thrown from the crater. The\r\ncocoa, pandanus, and mangrove take root upon the coral reef before it\r\nhas fairly risen above the waves. The burning stream of lava that\r\ndescends from Etna rolls through the stately forest, and converts to\r\nashes every tree and herb which stands in its way; but the black strip\r\nof land thus desolated is covered again in the course of time, with\r\noaks, pines, and chestnuts, as luxuriant as those which the fiery\r\ntorrent swept away.\r\n\r\nEvery flood and landslip, every wave which a hurricane or earthquake\r\nthrows upon the shore, every shower of volcanic dust and ashes which\r\nburies a country far and wide to the depth of many feet, every advance\r\nof the sand-flood, every conversion of salt water into fresh when rivers\r\nalter their main channel of discharge, every permanent variation in the\r\nrise or fall of tides in an estuary--these and countless other causes\r\ndisplace, in the course of a few centuries, certain plants and animals\r\nfrom stations which they previously occupied. If, therefore, the Author\r\nof nature had not been prodigal of those numerous contrivances, before\r\nalluded to, for spreading all classes of organic beings over the\r\nearth--if he had not ordained that the fluctuations of the animate and\r\ninanimate creation should be in perfect harmony with each other, it is\r\nevident that considerable spaces, now the most habitable on the globe,\r\nwould soon be as devoid of life as are the Alpine snows, or the dark\r\nabysses of the ocean, or the moving sands of the Sahara.\r\n\r\nThe powers, then, of migration and diffusion conferred on animals and\r\nplants are indispensable to enable them to maintain their ground, and\r\nwould be necessary, even though it were never intended that a species\r\nshould gradually extend its geographical range. But a facility of\r\nshifting their quarters being once given, it cannot fail to happen that\r\nthe inhabitants of one province should occasionally penetrate into some\r\nother; since the strongest of those barriers which I before described as\r\nseparating distinct regions are all liable to be thrown down, one after\r\nthe other, during the vicissitudes of the earth's surface.\r\n\r\n_How changes in physical Geography affect the distribution of\r\nspecies._--The numbers and distribution of particular species are\r\naffected in two ways, by changes in the physical geography of the\r\nearth:--First, these changes promote or retard the migrations of\r\nspecies; secondly, they alter the physical conditions of the localities\r\nwhich species inhabit. If the ocean should gradually wear its way\r\nthrough an isthmus, like that of Suez, it would open a passage for the\r\nintermixture of the aquatic tribes of two seas previously disjoined, and\r\nwould, at the same time, close a free communication which the\r\nterrestrial plants and animals of two continents had before enjoyed.\r\nThese would be, perhaps, the most important consequences, in regard to\r\nthe distribution of species, which would result from the breach made by\r\nthe sea in such a spot; but there would be others of a distinct nature,\r\nsuch as the conversion of a certain tract of land, which formed the\r\nisthmus, into sea. This space, previously occupied by terrestrial plants\r\nand animals, would be immediately delivered over to the aquatic; a local\r\nrevolution which might have happened in innumerable other parts of the\r\nglobe, without being attended by any alteration in the blending together\r\nof species of two distinct provinces.\r\n\r\n_Rate of change of species cannot be uniform._--This observation leads\r\nme to point out one of the most interesting conclusions to which we are\r\nled by the contemplation of the vicissitudes of the inanimate world in\r\nrelation to those of the animate. It is clear that, if the agency of\r\ninorganic causes be uniform, as I have supposed, they must operate very\r\nirregularly on the state of organic beings, so that the rate according\r\nto which these will change in particular regions will not be equal in\r\nequal periods of time.\r\n\r\nI am not about to advocate the doctrine of general catastrophes\r\nrecurring at certain intervals, as in the ancient Oriental cosmogonies,\r\nnor do I doubt that, if very considerable periods of equal duration\r\ncould be compared one with another, the rate of change in the living, as\r\nwell as in the inorganic world, might be nearly uniform; but if we\r\nregard each of the causes separately, which we know to be at present the\r\nmost instrumental in remodelling the state of the surface, we shall find\r\nthat we must expect each to be in action for thousands of years, without\r\nproducing any extensive alterations in the habitable surface, and then\r\nto give rise, during a very brief period, to important revolutions.\r\n\r\n_Illustration derived from subsidences._--I shall illustrate this\r\nprinciple by a few of the most remarkable examples which present\r\nthemselves. In the course of the last century, as we have seen, a\r\nconsiderable number of instances are recorded of the solid surface,\r\nwhether covered by water or not, having been permanently sunk or\r\nupraised by subterranean movements. Most of these convulsions are only\r\naccompanied by temporary fluctuations in the state of limited districts,\r\nand a continued repetition of these events for thousands of years might\r\nnot produce any decided change in the state of many of those great\r\nzoological or botanical provinces of which I have sketched the\r\nboundaries.\r\n\r\nWhen, for example, large parts of the ocean and even of inland seas are\r\na thousand fathoms or upwards in depth, it is a matter of no moment to\r\nthe animate creation that vast tracts should be heaved up many fathoms\r\nat certain intervals, or should subside to the same amount. Neither can\r\nany material revolution be produced in South America either in the\r\nterrestrial or the marine plants or animals by a series of shocks on the\r\ncoast of Chili, each of which, like that of Penco, in 1751, should\r\nuplift the coast about twenty-five feet. Nor if the ground sinks fifty\r\nfeet at a time, as in the harbor of Port Royal, in Jamaica, in 1692,\r\nwill such alterations of level work any general fluctuations in the\r\nstate of organic beings inhabiting the West Indian Islands, or the\r\nCaribbean Sea.\r\n\r\nIt is only when the subterranean powers, by shifting gradually the\r\npoints where their principal force is developed, happen to strike upon\r\nsome particular region where a slight change of level immediately\r\naffects the distribution of land and water, or the state of the climate,\r\nor the barriers between distinct groups of species over extensive areas,\r\nthat the rate of fluctuation becomes accelerated, and may, in the course\r\nof a few years or centuries, work mightier changes than had been\r\nexperienced in myriads of antecedent years.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, a repetition of subsidences causing the narrow\r\nisthmus of Panama to sink down a few hundred feet, would, in a few\r\ncenturies, bring about a great revolution in the state of the animate\r\ncreation in the western hemisphere. Thousands of aquatic species would\r\npass, for the first time, from the Caribbean Sea into the Pacific; and\r\nthousands of others, before peculiar to the Pacific Ocean, would make\r\ntheir way into the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic.\r\nA considerable modification would probably be occasioned by the same\r\nevent in the direction or volume of the Gulf stream, and thereby the\r\ntemperature of the sea and the contiguous lands might be altered as far\r\nas the influence of that current extends. A change of climate might thus\r\nbe produced in the ocean from Florida to Spitzbergen, and in many\r\ncountries of North America, Europe, and Greenland. Not merely the heat,\r\nbut the quantity of rain which falls, would be altered in certain\r\ndistricts, so that many species would be excluded from tracts where they\r\nbefore flourished: others would be reduced in number; and some would\r\nthrive more and multiply. The seeds also and the fruits of plants would\r\nno longer be drifted in precisely the same directions, nor the eggs of\r\naquatic animals; neither would species be any longer impeded in their\r\nmigrations towards particular stations before shut out from them by\r\ntheir inability to cross the mighty current.\r\n\r\nLet us take another example from a part of the globe which is at present\r\nliable to suffer by earthquakes, namely, the low sandy tract which\r\nintervenes between the sea of Azof and the Caspian. If there should\r\noccur a sinking down to a trifling amount, and such ravines should be\r\nformed as might be produced by a few earthquakes, not more considerable\r\nthan have fallen within our limited observation during the last 150\r\nyears, the waters of the Sea of Azof would pour rapidly into the\r\nCaspian, which, according to the measurements lately made by the Academy\r\nof St. Petersburg, is 84 feet below the level of the Black Sea.[984] The\r\nSea of Azof would immediately borrow from the Black Sea, that sea again\r\nfrom the Mediterranean, and the Mediterranean from the Atlantic, so that\r\nan inexhaustible current would pour down into the low tracts of Asia\r\nbordering the Caspian, by which all the sandy salt steppes adjacent to\r\nthat sea would be inundated. An area of several thousand square leagues,\r\nnow below the level of the Mediterranean, would be converted from land\r\ninto sea.\r\n\r\n_Illustration derived from the elevation of land._--Let us next imagine\r\na few cases of the elevation of land of small extent at certain critical\r\npoints, as, for example, in the shallowest part of the Straits of\r\nGibraltar, where the deepest soundings from the African to the European\r\nside give only 220 fathoms. In proportion as this submarine barrier of\r\nrock was upheaved, the whole channel would be contracted in width and\r\ndepth, and the volume of water which the current constantly flowing from\r\nthe Atlantic pours into the Mediterranean would be lessened. But the\r\nloss of the inland sea by evaporation would remain the same; so that\r\nbeing no longer able to draw on the ocean for a supply sufficient to\r\nrestore its equilibrium, it must sink, and leave dry a certain portion\r\nof land around its borders. The current which now flows constantly out\r\nof the Black Sea into the Mediterranean would then rush in more rapidly,\r\nand the level of the Mediterranean would be thereby prevented from\r\nfalling so low; but the level of the Black Sea would, for the same\r\nreason, sink; so that when, by a continued series of elevatory\r\nmovements, the Straits of Gibraltar had become completely closed up, we\r\nmight expect large and level sandy steppes to surround both the Black\r\nSea and Mediterranean, like those occurring at present on the skirts of\r\nthe Caspian and the Lake of Aral. The geographical range of hundreds of\r\naquatic species would be thereby circumscribed, and that of hundreds of\r\nterrestrial plants and animals extended.\r\n\r\nA line of submarine volcanos crossing the channel of some strait, and\r\ngradually choking it up with ashes and lava, might produce a new barrier\r\nas effectually as a series of earthquakes; especially if thermal\r\nsprings, charged with carbonate of lime, silica, and other mineral\r\ningredients, should promote the rapid multiplication of corals and\r\nshells, and cement them together with solid matter precipitated during\r\nthe intervals between eruptions. Suppose in this manner a stoppage to be\r\ncaused of the Bahama channel between the bank of that name and the coast\r\nof Florida. This insignificant revolution, confined to a mere spot in\r\nthe bottom of the ocean, would, by diverting the main current of the\r\nGulf stream, give rise to extensive changes in the climate and\r\ndistribution of animals and plants inhabiting the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n_Illustration from the formation of new islands._--A repetition of\r\nelevatory movements of earthquakes might continue over an area as\r\nextensive as Europe, for thousands of ages, at the bottom of the ocean,\r\nin certain regions, and produce no visible effects; whereas, if they\r\nshould operate in some shallow parts of the Pacific, amid the coral\r\narchipelagos, they would soon give birth to a new continent. Hundreds of\r\nvolcanic islands may be thrown up, and become covered with vegetation,\r\nwithout causing more than local fluctuations in the animate world; but\r\nif a chain like the Aleutian archipelago, or the Kurile Isles, run for a\r\ndistance of many hundred miles, so as to form an almost uninterrupted\r\ncommunication between two continents, or two distant islands, the\r\nmigrations of plants, birds, insects, and even of some quadrupeds, may\r\ncause, in a short time, an extraordinary series of revolutions tending\r\nto augment the range of some animals and plants, and to limit that of\r\nothers. A new archipelago might be formed in the Mediterranean, the Bay\r\nof Biscay, and a thousand other places, and might produce less important\r\nevents than one rock which should rise up between Australia and Java, so\r\nplaced that winds and currents might cause an interchange of the plants,\r\ninsects, and birds.\r\n\r\n_From the wearing through of an isthmus._--If we turn from the igneous\r\nto the aqueous agents, we find the same tendency to an irregular rate of\r\nchange, naturally connected with the strictest uniformity in the energy\r\nof those causes. When the sea, for example, gradually encroaches upon\r\nboth sides of a narrow isthmus, as that of Sleswick, separating the\r\nNorth Sea from the Baltic, where, as before stated, the cliffs on both\r\nthe opposite coasts are wasting away[985], no material alteration\r\nresults for thousands of years, save only that there is a progressive\r\nconversion of a small strip of land into water. A few feet only, or a\r\nfew yards, are annually removed; but if, at last, the partition should\r\nbe broken down, and the tides of the ocean should enter by a direct\r\npassage into the inland sea, instead of going by a circuitous route\r\nthrough the Cattegat, a body of salt water would sweep up as far as the\r\nGulfs of Bothnia and Finland, the waters of which are now brackish, or\r\nalmost fresh; and this revolution would be attended by the local\r\nannihilation of many species.\r\n\r\nSimilar consequences must have resulted on a small scale, when the sea\r\nopened its way through the Isthmus of Staveren in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, forming a union between an inland lake and the ocean, and\r\nopening, in the course of one century, a shallow strait, more than half\r\nas wide as the narrowest part of that which divides England from France.\r\n\r\n_Changes in physical geography which must occasion extinction of\r\nspecies._--It will almost seem superfluous, after I have thus traced the\r\nimportant modifications in the condition of living beings which flow\r\nfrom changes of trifling extent, to argue that entire revolutions might\r\nbe brought about, if the climate and physical geography of the whole\r\nglobe were greatly altered. It has been stated, that species are in\r\ngeneral local, some being confined to extremely small spots, and\r\ndepending for their existence on a combination of causes, which, if they\r\nare to be met with elsewhere, occur only in some very remote region.\r\nHence it must happen that, when the nature of these localities is\r\nchanged, the species will perish; for it will rarely happen that the\r\ncause which alters the character of the district will afford new\r\nfacilities to the species to establish itself elsewhere.\r\n\r\n_African deserts._--If we attribute the origin of a great part of the\r\ndesert of Africa to the gradual progress of moving sands driven eastward\r\nby the westerly winds, we may safely infer that a variety of species\r\nmust have been annihilated by this cause alone. The sand-flood has been\r\ninundating, from time immemorial, some of the rich lands on the west of\r\nthe Nile; and we have only to multiply this effect a sufficient number\r\nof times in order to understand how, in the lapse of ages, a whole group\r\nof terrestrial animals and plants may become extinct.\r\n\r\nThe African desert, without including Bornou and Darfour, extends,\r\naccording to the calculation of Humboldt, over 194,000 square leagues;\r\nan area nearly three times as great as that of France. In a small\r\nportion of so vast a space, we may infer from analogy that there were\r\nmany peculiar species of plants and animals which must have been\r\nbanished by the sand, and their habitations invaded by the camel, and by\r\nbirds and insects formed for the arid sands.\r\n\r\nThere is evidently nothing in the nature of the catastrophe to favor the\r\nescape of the former inhabitants to some adjoining province; nothing to\r\nweaken, in the bordering lands, that powerful barrier against\r\nemigration--pre-occupancy. Nor, even if the exclusion of a certain group\r\nof species from a given tract were compensated by an extension of their\r\nrange over a new country, would that circumstance tend to the\r\nconservation of species in general; for the extirpation would merely\r\nthen be transferred to the region so invaded. If it be imagined, for\r\nexample, that the aboriginal quadrupeds, birds, and other animals of\r\nAfrica, emigrated in consequence of the advance of drift-sand, and\r\ncolonized Arabia, the indigenous Arabian species must have given way\r\nbefore them, and have been reduced in number or destroyed.\r\n\r\nLet us next suppose that, in some central or more elevated parts of the\r\ngreat African desert, the upheaving power of subterranean movements\r\nshould be exerted throughout an immense series of ages, accompanied, at\r\ncertain intervals, by volcanic eruptions, such as gave rise at once, in\r\n1755, to a mountain 1600 feet high, on the Mexican plateau. When the\r\ncontinued repetition of these events had caused a mountain-chain, it is\r\nobvious that a complete transformation in the state of the climate would\r\nbe brought about throughout a vast area.\r\n\r\nWe may imagine the summits of the new chain to rise so high as to be\r\ncovered, like Mount Atlas, for several thousand feet, with snow, during\r\na great part of the year. The melting of these snows, during the\r\ngreatest heat, would cause the rivers to swell in the season when the\r\ngreatest drought now prevails; the waters, moreover, derived from this\r\nsource, would always be of lower temperature than the surrounding\r\natmosphere, and would thus contribute to cool the climate. During the\r\nnumerous earthquakes and volcanic eruptions supposed to accompany the\r\ngradual formation of the chain, there would be many floods caused by the\r\nbursting of temporary lakes, and by the melting of snows by lava. These\r\ninundations might deposit alluvial matter far and wide over the original\r\nsands, as the country assumed varied shapes, and was modified again and\r\nagain by the moving power from below, and the aqueous erosion of the\r\nsurface above. At length the Sahara might be fertilized, irrigated by\r\nrivers and streamlets intersecting it in every direction, and covered by\r\njungle and morasses; so that the animals and plants which now people\r\nNorthern Africa would disappear, and the region would gradually become\r\nfitted for the reception of a population of species perfectly dissimilar\r\nin their forms, habits, and organization.\r\n\r\nThere are always some peculiar and characteristic features in the\r\nphysical geography of each large division of the globe; and on these\r\npeculiarities the state of animal and vegetable life is dependent. If,\r\ntherefore, we admit incessant fluctuations in the physical geography, we\r\nmust, at the same time, concede the successive extinction of terrestrial\r\nand aquatic species to be part of the economy of our system. When some\r\ngreat class of _stations_ is in excess in certain latitudes, as, for\r\nexample, in wide savannahs, arid sands, lofty mountains, or inland seas,\r\nwe find a corresponding development of species adapted for such\r\ncircumstances. In North America, where there is a chain of vast inland\r\nlakes of fresh water, we find an extraordinary abundance and variety of\r\naquatic birds, fresh-water fish, testacea, and small amphibious\r\nreptiles, fitted for such a climate. The greater part of these would\r\nperish if the lakes were destroyed,--an event that might be brought\r\nabout by some of the least of those important revolutions contemplated\r\nin geology. It might happen that no fresh-water lakes of corresponding\r\nmagnitude might then exist on the globe; or that, if they occurred\r\nelsewhere, they might be situated in New Holland, Southern Africa,\r\nEastern Asia, or some region so distant as to be quite inaccessible to\r\nthe North American species; or they might be situated within the\r\ntropics, in a climate uninhabitable by creatures fitted for a temperate\r\nzone; or, finally, we may presume that they would be pre-occupied by\r\n_indigenous_ tribes.\r\n\r\nA vivid description has been given by Mr. Darwin and Sir W. Parish of\r\nthe great droughts which have sometimes visited the Pampas of South\r\nAmerica, for three or four years in succession, during which an\r\nincredible number of wild animals, cattle, horses, and birds, have\r\nperished from want of food and water. Several hundred thousand animals\r\nwere drowned in the Parana alone, having rushed into the river to drink,\r\nand being too much exhausted by hunger to escape.[986] Such droughts are\r\noften attended in South America and other hot climates by wide-spreading\r\nconflagrations, caused by lightning, which fires the dried grass and\r\nbrush-wood. Thus quadrupeds, birds, insects, and other creatures, are\r\ndestroyed by myriads. How many species, both of the animal and vegetable\r\nworld, which once flourished in the country between the valley of the\r\nParana and the Straits of Magellan, may not have been annihilated, since\r\nthe first drought or first conflagration began!\r\n\r\nTo pursue this train of reasoning farther is unnecessary; the geologist\r\nhas only to reflect on what has been said of the habitations and\r\nstations of organic beings in general, and to consider them in relation\r\nto those effects which were contemplated in the second book, as\r\nresulting from the igneous and aqueous causes now in action, and he will\r\nimmediately perceive that, amidst the vicissitudes of the earth's\r\nsurface, species cannot be immortal, but must perish, one after the\r\nother, like the individuals which compose them. There is no possibility\r\nof escaping from this conclusion, without resorting to some hypothesis\r\nas violent as that of Lamarck, who imagined, as we have before seen,\r\nthat species are each of them endowed with indefinite powers of\r\nmodifying their organization, in conformity to the endless changes of\r\ncircumstances to which they are exposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effects of a general Alteration in Climate on the Distribution of\r\nSpecies._\r\n\r\nSome of the effects which must attend every general alteration of\r\n_climate_ are sufficiently peculiar to claim a separate consideration\r\nbefore concluding the present chapter.\r\n\r\nI have before stated that, during seasons of extraordinary severity,\r\nmany northern birds, and in some countries many quadrupeds, migrate\r\nsouthwards. If these cold seasons were to become frequent, in\r\nconsequence of a gradual and general refrigeration of the atmosphere,\r\nsuch migrations would be more and more regular, until, at length, many\r\nanimals, now confined to the arctic regions, would become the tenants of\r\nthe temperate zone; while the inhabitants of the temperate zone would\r\napproach nearer to the equator. At the same time, many species\r\npreviously established on high mountains would begin to descend, in\r\nevery latitude, towards the middle regions; and those which were\r\nconfined to the flanks of mountains would make their way into the\r\nplains. Analogous changes would also take place in the vegetable\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, the heat of the atmosphere be on the increase, the\r\nplants and animals of low grounds would ascend to higher levels, the\r\nequatorial species would migrate into the temperate zone, and those of\r\nthe temperate into the arctic circle.\r\n\r\nBut although some species might thus be preserved, every great change of\r\nclimate must be fatal to many which can find no place of retreat when\r\ntheir original habitations become unfit for them. For if the general\r\ntemperature be on the rise, then there is no cooler region whither the\r\npolar species can take refuge; if it be on the decline, then the animals\r\nand plants previously established between the tropics have no resource.\r\nSuppose the general heat of the atmosphere to increase, so that even the\r\narctic region became too warm for the musk-ox, and rein-deer, it is\r\nclear that they must perish; so if the torrid zone should lose so much\r\nof its heat, by the progressive refrigeration of the earth's surface, as\r\nto be an unfit habitation for apes, boas, bamboos, and palms, these\r\ntribes of animals and plants, or, at least; most of the species now\r\nbelonging to them, would become extinct, for there would be no warmer\r\nlatitudes for their reception.\r\n\r\nIt will follow, therefore, that as often as the climates of the globe\r\nare passing from the extreme of heat to that of cold--from the summer to\r\nthe winter of the great year before alluded to[987]--the migratory\r\nmovement will be directed constantly from the poles towards the equator;\r\nand for this reason the species inhabiting parallel latitudes, in the\r\nnorthern and southern hemispheres, must become widely different. For I\r\nassume, on grounds before explained, that the original stock of each\r\nspecies is introduced into one spot of the earth only, and,\r\nconsequently, no species can be at once indigenous in the arctic and\r\nantarctic circles.\r\n\r\nBut when, on the contrary, a series of changes in the physical geography\r\nof the globe, or any other supposed cause, occasions an elevation of the\r\ngeneral temperature,--when there is a passage from the winter to one of\r\nthe vernal or summer seasons of the great cycle of climate,--then the\r\norder of the migratory movement is inverted. The different species of\r\nanimals and plants direct their course from the equator towards the\r\npoles; and the northern and southern hemispheres may become peopled to\r\na certain limited extent by identical species.\r\n\r\nI say limited, because we cannot speculate on the entire transposition\r\nof a group of animals and plants from tropical to polar latitudes, or\r\nthe reverse, as a probable or even possible event. We may believe the\r\nmean annual temperature of one zone to be transferable to another, but\r\nwe know that the same climate cannot be so transferred. Whatever be the\r\ngeneral temperature of the earth's surface, comparative equability of\r\nheat will characterize the tropical regions; while great periodical\r\nvariations will belong to the temperate, and still more to the polar\r\nlatitudes. These, and many other peculiarities connected with heat and\r\nlight, depend on fixed astronomical causes, such as the motion of the\r\nearth and its position in relation to the sun, and not on those\r\nfluctuations of its surface which may influence the general temperature.\r\n\r\nAmong many obstacles to such extensive transference of habitations, we\r\nmust not forget the immense lapse of time required, according to the\r\nhypothesis before suggested, to bring about a considerable change in\r\nclimate. During a period so vast, the other cause of extirpation, before\r\nenumerated, would exert so powerful an influence as to prevent all, save\r\na very few hardy species, from passing from equatorial to polar regions,\r\nor from the tropics to the pole.[988]\r\n\r\nBut the power of accommodation to new circumstances is great in certain\r\nspecies, and might enable many to pass from one zone to another, if the\r\nmean annual heat of the atmosphere and the ocean were greatly altered.\r\nTo the marine tribes, especially, such a passage would be possible; for\r\nthey are less impeded in their migrations by barriers of land, than are\r\nthe terrestrial by the ocean. Add to this, that the temperature of the\r\nocean is much more uniform than that of the atmosphere investing the\r\nland; so that we may easily suppose that most of the testacea, fish, and\r\nother classes, might pass from the equatorial into the temperate\r\nregions, if the mean temperature of those regions were transposed,\r\nalthough a second expatriation of these species of tropical origin into\r\nthe arctic and antarctic circles would probably be impossible.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider more particularly the effect of vicissitudes of\r\nclimate in causing one species to give way before the increasing numbers\r\nof some other.\r\n\r\nWhen temperature forms the barrier which arrests the progress of an\r\nanimal or plant in a particular direction, the individuals are fewer and\r\nless vigorous as they approach the extreme confines of the geographical\r\nrange of the species. But these stragglers are ready to multiply rapidly\r\non the slightest increase or diminution of heat that may be favorable to\r\nthem, just as particular insects increase during a hot summer, and\r\ncertain plants and animals gain ground after a series of congenial\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nIn almost every district, especially if it be mountainous, there are a\r\nvariety of species the limits of whose habitations are conterminous,\r\nsome being unable to proceed farther without encountering too much heat,\r\nothers too much cold. Individuals, which are thus on the borders of the\r\nregions proper to their respective species, are like the outposts of\r\nhostile armies, ready to profit by every slight change of circumstances\r\nin their favor, and to advance upon the ground occupied by their\r\nneighbors and opponents.\r\n\r\nThe proximity of distinct climates produced by the inequalities of the\r\nearth's surface, brings species possessing very different constitutions\r\ninto such immediate contact, that their naturalizations are very speedy\r\nwhenever opportunities of advancing present themselves. Many insects and\r\nplants, for example, are common to low plains within the arctic circle,\r\nand to lofty mountains in Scotland and other parts of Europe. If the\r\nclimate, therefore, of the polar regions were transferred to our own\r\nlatitudes, the species in question would immediately descend from these\r\nelevated stations to overrun the low grounds. Invasions of this kind,\r\nattended by the expulsion of the pre-occupants, are almost\r\ninstantaneous, because the change of temperature not only places the one\r\nspecies in a more favorable position, but renders the others sickly and\r\nalmost incapable of defence.\r\n\r\n_These changes inconsistent with the theory of transmutation._--Lamarck,\r\nwhen speculating on the transmutation of species, supposed every\r\nmodification in organization and instinct to be brought about slowly and\r\ninsensibly in an indefinite lapse of ages. But he does not appear to\r\nhave sufficiently considered how much every alteration in the physical\r\ncondition of the habitable surface changes the relations of a great\r\nnumber of coexisting species, and that some of these would be ready\r\ninstantly to avail themselves of the slightest change in their favor,\r\nand to multiply to the injury of others. Even if we thought it possible\r\nthat the palm or the elephant, which now flourish in equatorial regions,\r\ncould ever learn to bear the variable seasons of our temperate zone, or\r\nthe rigors of an arctic winter, we might with no less confidence affirm,\r\nthat they must perish before they had time to become habituated to such\r\nnew circumstances. That they would be displaced by other species as\r\noften as the climate varied, may be inferred from the data before\r\nexplained respecting the local extermination of species produced by the\r\nmultiplication of others.\r\n\r\nSuppose the climate of the highest part of the woody zone of Etna to be\r\ntransferred to the sea-shore of the base of the mountain, no botanist\r\nwould anticipate that the olive, lemon-tree, and prickly pear (_Cactus\r\nOpuntia_) would be able to contend with the oak and chestnut, which\r\nwould begin forthwith to descend to a lower level; or that these last\r\nwould be able to stand their ground against the pine, which would also,\r\nin the space of a few years, begin to occupy a lower position. We might\r\nform some kind of estimate of the time which might be required for the\r\nmigrations of these plants; whereas we have no data for concluding that\r\nany number of thousands of years would be sufficient for one step in\r\nthe pretended metamorphosis of one species into another, possessing\r\ndistinct attributes and qualities.\r\n\r\nThis argument is applicable not merely to _climate_, but to any other\r\ncause of mutation. However slowly a lake may be converted into a marsh,\r\nor a marsh into a meadow, it is evident that before the lacustrine\r\nplants can acquire the power of living in marshes, or the marsh-plants\r\nof living in a less humid soil, other species, already existing in the\r\nregion, and fitted for these several stations, will intrude and keep\r\npossession of the ground. So, if a tract of salt water becomes fresh by\r\npassing through every intermediate degree of brackishness, still the\r\nmarine mollusks will never be permitted to be gradually metamorphosed\r\ninto fluviatile species; because long before any such transformation can\r\ntake place by slow and insensible degrees, other tribes, already formed\r\nto delight in brackish or fresh water, will avail themselves of the\r\nchange in the fluid, and will, each in their turn, monopolize the space.\r\n\r\nIt is idle, therefore, to dispute about the abstract possibility of the\r\nconversion of one species into another, when there are known causes so\r\nmuch more active in their nature, which must always intervene and\r\nprevent the actual accomplishment of such conversions. A faint image of\r\nthe certain doom of a species less fitted to struggle with some new\r\ncondition in a region which it previously inhabited, and where it has to\r\ncontend with a more vigorous species, is presented by the extirpation of\r\nsavage tribes of men by the advancing colony of some civilized nation.\r\nIn this case the contest is merely between two different _races_--two\r\nvarieties, moreover, of a species which exceeds all others in its\r\naptitude to accommodate its habits to the most extraordinary variations\r\nof circumstances. Yet few future events are more certain than the speedy\r\nextermination of the Indians of North America and the savages of New\r\nHolland in the course of a few centuries, when these tribes will be\r\nremembered only in poetry or history.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding remarks._--We often hear astonishment expressed at the\r\ndisappearance from the earth in times comparatively modern of many small\r\nas well as large animals, the remains of which have been found in a\r\nfossil state, under circumstances implying that neither any great\r\ngeographical revolution, nor the exterminating influence of man has\r\nintervened to account for their extinction. But in all such cases we\r\nshould inquire whether we are sufficiently acquainted with the numerous\r\nand complicated conditions on which the perpetuation of each species\r\ndepends, to entitle us to wonder if it should be suddenly cut off.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, when calling attention to the fact that the horse,\r\nmegatherium, megalonyx, and many contemporary Mammalia, had perished in\r\nSouth America after that continent had acquired its present\r\nconfiguration, and when, if we may judge by the Testacea, the climate\r\nvery nearly resembled the present, observes, \"that in the living\r\ncreation one species is often extremely rare in a given region, while\r\nanother of the same genus and with closely allied habits is exceedingly\r\ncommon. A zoologist familiar with such phenomena, if asked to explain\r\nthem, usually replies, that some slight difference in climate, food, or\r\nthe number of its enemies, must determine the relative strength of the\r\ntwo species in question, although we may be unable to point out the\r\nprecise manner of the action of the check. We are, therefore, driven to\r\nthe conclusion, that causes generally quite inappreciable by us\r\ndetermine whether a given species shall be abundant or scanty in\r\nnumbers. Why, then, should we feel astonishment if the rarity is\r\noccasionally carried a step farther,--to extinction?\"[989]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nEXTINCTION AND CREATION OF SPECIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Theory of the successive extinction of species consistent with a\r\n    limited geographical distribution--Opinions of botanists respecting\r\n    the centres from which plants have been diffused--Whether there are\r\n    grounds for inferring that the loss, from time to time, of certain\r\n    animals and plants, is compensated by the introduction of new\r\n    species?--Whether any evidence of such new creations could be\r\n    expected within the historical era?--The question whether the\r\n    existing species have been created in succession must be decided by\r\n    geological monuments.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Successive Extinction of Species consistent with their limited\r\nGeographical Distribution._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters I have pointed out the strict dependence of\r\neach species of animal and plant on certain physical conditions in the\r\nstate of the earth's surface, and on the number and attributes of other\r\norganic beings inhabiting the same region. I have also endeavored to\r\nshow that all these conditions are in a state of continual fluctuation,\r\nthe igneous and aqueous agents remodelling, from time to time, the\r\nphysical geography of the globe, and the migrations of species causing\r\nnew relations to spring up successively between different organic\r\nbeings. I have deduced as a corollary, that the species existing at any\r\nparticular period, must, in the course of ages, become extinct one after\r\nthe other. \"They must die out,\" to borrow an emphatical expression from\r\nBuffon, \"because Time fights against them.\"\r\n\r\nIf the views which I have taken are just, there will be no difficulty in\r\nexplaining why the habitations of so many species are now restrained\r\nwithin exceedingly narrow limits. Every local revolution, such as those\r\ncontemplated in the preceding chapter, tends to circumscribe the range\r\nof some species, while it enlarges that of others; and if we are led to\r\ninfer that new species originate in one spot only, each must require\r\ntime to diffuse itself over a wide area. It will follow, therefore, from\r\nthe adoption of this hypothesis, that the recent origin of some species,\r\nand the high antiquity of others, are equally consistent with the\r\ngeneral fact of their limited distribution; some being local, because\r\nthey have not existed long enough to admit of their wide dissemination;\r\nothers, because circumstances in the animate or inanimate world have\r\noccurred to restrict the range which they may once have obtained. As a\r\ngeneral rule, however, species, common to many distant provinces, or\r\nthose now found to inhabit very distant parts of the globe, are to be\r\nregarded as the most ancient. Numerically speaking, they may not perhaps\r\nbe largely represented, but their wide diffusion shows that they have\r\nhad a long time to spread themselves, and have been able to survive many\r\nimportant revolutions in physical geography.\r\n\r\nAfter so much evidence has been brought to light by the geologist, of\r\nland and sea having changed places in various regions since the existing\r\nspecies were in being, we can feel no surprise that the zoologist and\r\nbotanist have hitherto found it difficult to refer the geographical\r\ndistribution of species to any clear and determinate principles, since\r\nthey have usually speculated on the phenomena, upon the assumption that\r\nthe physical geography of the globe had undergone no material alteration\r\nsince the introduction of the species now living. So long as this\r\nassumption was made, the facts relating to the geography of plants and\r\nanimals appeared capricious in the extreme, and by many the subject was\r\npronounced to be so full of mystery and anomalies, that the\r\nestablishment of a satisfactory theory was hopeless.[990]\r\n\r\n_Centres from which plants have been diffused._--Some botanists\r\nconceived, in accordance with the hypothesis of Wildenow, that mountains\r\nwere the centres of creation from which the plants now inhabiting large\r\ncontinents have radiated; to which De Candolle and others, with much\r\nreason, objected, that mountains, on the contrary, are often the\r\nbarriers between two provinces of distinct vegetation. The geologist who\r\nis acquainted with the extensive modifications which the surface of the\r\nearth has undergone in very recent geological epochs, may be able,\r\nperhaps, to reconcile both these theories in their application to\r\ndifferent regions.\r\n\r\nA lofty range of mountains, which is so ancient as to date from a period\r\nwhen the species of animals and plants differed from those now living,\r\nwill naturally form a barrier between contiguous provinces; but a chain\r\nwhich has been raised, in great part, within the epoch of existing\r\nspecies, and around which new lands have arisen from the sea within that\r\nperiod, will be a centre of peculiar vegetation.\r\n\r\n\"In France,\" observes De Candolle, \"the Alps and Cevennes prevent a\r\ngreat number of the plants of the south from spreading themselves to the\r\nnorthward; but it has been remarked that some species have made their\r\nway through the gorges of these chains, and are found on their northern\r\nsides, principally in those places where they are lower and more\r\ninterrupted.\"[991] Now the chains here alluded to have probably been of\r\nconsiderable height ever since the era when the existing vegetation\r\nbegan to appear, and were it not for the deep fissures which divide\r\nthem, they might have caused much more abrupt terminations to the\r\nextension of distinct assemblages of species.\r\n\r\nParts of the Italian peninsula, on the other hand, have gained a\r\nconsiderable portion of their present height since a majority of the\r\nmarine species now inhabiting the Mediterranean, and probably, also,\r\nsince the terrestrial plants of the same region were in being. Large\r\ntracts of land have been added, both on the Adriatic and Mediterranean\r\nside, to what originally constituted a much narrower range of mountains,\r\nif not a chain of islands running nearly north and south, like Corsica\r\nand Sardinia. It may therefore be presumed that the Apennines have been\r\na centre whence species have diffused themselves over the contiguous\r\n_lower_ and _newer_ regions. In this and all analogous situations, the\r\ndoctrine of Wildenow, that species have radiated from the mountains as\r\nfrom centres, may be well founded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Introduction of New Species._\r\n\r\nIf the reader should infer, from the facts laid before him in the\r\npreceding chapters, that the successive extinction of animals and plants\r\nmay be part of the constant and regular course of nature, he will\r\nnaturally inquire whether there are any means provided for the repair of\r\nthese losses? Is it part of the economy of our system that the habitable\r\nglobe should, to a certain extent, become depopulated both in the ocean\r\nand on the land; or that the variety of species should diminish until\r\nsome new era arrives when a new and extraordinary effort of creative\r\nenergy is to be displayed? Or is it possible that new species can be\r\ncalled into being from time to time, and yet that so astonishing a\r\nphenomenon can escape the observation of naturalists?\r\n\r\nHumboldt has characterized these subjects as among the mysteries which\r\nnatural science cannot reach; and he observes that the investigation of\r\nthe origin of beings does not belong to zoological or botanical\r\ngeography. To geology, however, these topics do strictly appertain; and\r\nthis science is chiefly interested in inquiries into the state of the\r\nanimate creation as it now exists, with a view of pointing out its\r\nrelations to antecedent periods when its condition was different.\r\n\r\nBefore offering any hypothesis towards the solution of so difficult a\r\nproblem, let us consider what kind of evidence we ought to expect, in\r\nthe present state of science, of the first appearance of new animals or\r\nplants, if we could imagine the successive creation of species to\r\nconstitute, like their gradual extinction, a regular part of the economy\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is obviously more easy to prove that a species,\r\nonce numerously represented in a given district, has ceased to be, than\r\nthat some other which did not pre-exist has made its\r\nappearance--assuming always, for reasons before stated, that single\r\nstocks only of each animal and plant are originally created, and that\r\nindividuals of new species do not suddenly start up in many different\r\nplaces at once.\r\n\r\nSo imperfect has the science of natural history remained down to our own\r\ntimes, that, within the memory of persons now living, the numbers of\r\nknown animals and plants have been doubled, or even quadrupled, in many\r\nclasses. New and often conspicuous species are annually discovered in\r\nparts of the old continent, long inhabited by the most civilized\r\nnations. Conscious, therefore, of the limited extent of our information,\r\nwe always infer, when such discoveries are made, that the beings in\r\nquestion had previously eluded our research; or had at least existed\r\nelsewhere, and only migrated at a recent period into the territories\r\nwhere we now find them. It is difficult, even in contemplation, to\r\nanticipate the time when we shall be entitled to make any other\r\nhypothesis in regard to all the marine tribes, and to by far the greater\r\nnumber of the terrestrial;--such as birds, which possess such unlimited\r\npowers of migration; insects, which, besides the variability of each\r\nspecies in number, are also so capable of being diffused to vast\r\ndistances; and cryptogamous plants, to which, as to many other classes,\r\nboth of the animal and vegetable kingdom, similar observations are\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\n_What kind of evidence of new creations could be expected?_--What kind\r\nof proofs, therefore, could we reasonably expect to find of the origin\r\nat a particular period of a new species?\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be said in reply that, within the last two or three\r\ncenturies, some forest tree or new quadruped might have been observed to\r\nappear suddenly in those parts, of England or France which had been most\r\nthoroughly investigated;--that naturalists might have been able to show\r\nthat no such living being inhabited any other region of the globe, and\r\nthat there was no tradition of anything similar having before been\r\nobserved in the district where it had made its appearance.\r\n\r\nNow, although this objection may seem plausible, yet its force will be\r\nfound to depend entirely on the rate of fluctuation which we suppose to\r\nprevail in the animate world, and on the proportion which such\r\nconspicuous subjects of the animal and vegetable kingdoms bear to those\r\nwhich are less known and escape our observation. There are, perhaps,\r\nmore than a million species of plants and animals, exclusive of the\r\nmicroscopic and infusory animalcules, now inhabiting the terraqueous\r\nglobe. The terrestrial plants may amount, says De Candolle, to somewhere\r\nbetween 110,000 and 120,000;[992] but the data on which this conjecture\r\nis founded are considered by many botanists to be vague and\r\nunsatisfactory. Sprengel only enumerated, in 1827, about 31,000 known\r\nphaenogamous, and 6000 cryptogamous plants; but that naturalist omitted\r\nmany, perhaps 7000 phaenogamous, and 1000 cryptogamous species. Mr.\r\nLindley, in a letter to the author in 1836, expressed his opinion that\r\nit would be rash to speculate on the existence of more than 80,000\r\nphaenogamous, and 10,000 cryptogamous plants. \"If we take,\" he says, in a\r\nletter to the author on this subject, \"37,000 as the number of published\r\nphaenogamous species, and then add, for the undiscovered species in Asia\r\nand New Holland, 15,000, in Africa 10,000, and in America 18,000, we\r\nhave 80,000 species; and if 7000 be the number of published cryptogamous\r\nplants, and we allow 3000 for the undiscovered species (making 10,000),\r\nthere would then be, on the whole, 90,000 species.\" But since that\r\nperiod one catalogue, as I learn from Dr. J. Hooker, contains a list of\r\nthe names of 78,000 phaenogamous plants which had been published before\r\n1841.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed by Linnaeus that there were four or five species of\r\ninsects in the world for each phaenogamous plant: but if we may judge\r\nfrom the relative proportion of the two classes in Great Britain, the\r\nnumber of insects must be still greater; for the total number of British\r\ninsects, \"according to the last census,\" is about 12,500;[993] whereas\r\nthere are only 1500 phaenogamous plants indigenous to our island. As the\r\ninsects are much more numerous in hot countries than in our temperate\r\nlatitudes, it seems difficult to avoid the conclusion that there are\r\nmore than half a million species in the world.\r\n\r\nThe number of known mammifers, when Temminck wrote, exceeded 800, and\r\nMr. Waterhouse informs me that more than 1200 are now (1850) ascertained\r\nto exist. Baron Cuvier estimated the amount of known fishes at 6000; and\r\nMr. G. Gray, in his \"Genera of Birds,\" enumerates 8000 species. We have\r\nstill to add the reptiles, and all the invertebrated animals, exclusive\r\nof insects. It remains, in a great degree, mere matter of conjecture\r\nwhat proportion the aquatic tribes may bear to the denizens of the land;\r\nbut the habitable surface beneath the waters can hardly be estimated at\r\nless than double that of the continents and islands, even admitting that\r\na very considerable area is destitute of life, in consequence of great\r\ndepth, cold, darkness, and other circumstances. In the late polar\r\nexpedition it was found that, in some regions, as in Baffin's Bay, there\r\nwere marine animals inhabiting the bottom at great depths, where the\r\ntemperature of the water was below the freezing point. That there is\r\nlife at much greater profundities in warmer regions may be confidently\r\ninferred.\r\n\r\nThe ocean teems with life--the class of _Polyps_ alone are conjectured\r\nby Lamarck to be as strong in individuals as insects. Every tropical\r\nreef is described as covered with Corals and Sponges, and swarming with\r\nCrustacea, Echini, and Testacea; while almost every tide-washed rock in\r\nthe world is carpeted with Fuci, and supports some Corallines, Actiniae,\r\nand Mollusca. There are innumerable forms in the seas of the warmer\r\nzones, which have scarcely begun to attract the attention of the\r\nnaturalist; and there are parasitic animals without number, three or\r\nfour of which are sometimes appropriated to one genus, as to the whale\r\n(_Balaena_), for example. Even though we concede, therefore, that the\r\ngeographical range of marine species is more extensive in general than\r\nthat of the terrestrial (the temperature of the sea being more uniform,\r\nand the land impeding less the migrations of the oceanic than the ocean\r\nthose of the terrestrial species), yet it seems probable that the\r\naquatic tribes far exceed in number the inhabitants of the land.\r\n\r\nWithout insisting on this point, it may be safe to assume, that,\r\nexclusive of microscopic beings, there are between one and two millions\r\nof species now inhabiting the terraqueous globe; so that if only one of\r\nthese were to become extinct annually, and one new one were to be every\r\nyear called into being, much more than a million of years might be\r\nrequired to bring about a complete revolution in organic life.\r\n\r\nI am not hazarding at present any hypothesis as to the probable rate of\r\nchange; but none will deny that when the _annual_ birth and the _annual_\r\ndeath of one species on the globe is proposed as a mere speculation,\r\nthis at least is to imagine no slight degree of instability in the\r\nanimate creation. If we divide the surface of the earth into twenty\r\nregions of equal area, one of these might comprehend a space of land and\r\nwater about equal in dimensions to Europe, and might contain a twentieth\r\npart of the million of species which may be assumed to exist in the\r\nanimal kingdom. In this region one species only would, according to the\r\nrate of mortality before assumed, perish in twenty years, or only five\r\nout of fifty thousand in the course of a century. But as a considerable\r\nproportion of the whole would belong to the aquatic classes, with which\r\nwe have a very imperfect acquaintance, we must exclude them from our\r\nconsideration; and if they constitute half of the entire number, then\r\none species only might be lost in forty years among the terrestrial\r\ntribes. Now the Mammalia, whether terrestrial or aquatic, bear so small\r\na proportion to other classes of animals, forming less, perhaps, than\r\none thousandth part of the whole, that if the longevity of species in\r\nthe different orders were equal, a vast period must elapse before it\r\nwould come to the turn of this conspicuous class to lose one of their\r\nnumber. If one species only of the whole animal kingdom died out in\r\nforty years, no more than one mammifer might disappear in 40,000 years\r\nin a region of the dimensions of Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is easy, therefore, to see, that in a small portion of such an area,\r\nin countries, for example, of the size of England and France, periods\r\nof much greater duration must elapse before it would be possible to\r\nauthenticate the first appearance of one of the larger plants and\r\nanimals, assuming the annual birth and death of one species to be the\r\nrate of vicissitude in the animate creation throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe observations of naturalists upon living species may, in the course\r\nof future centuries, accumulate positive data, from which an insight\r\ninto the laws which govern this part of our terrestrial system may be\r\nderived; but, in the present deficiency of historical records, we have\r\ntraced up the subject to that point where geological monuments alone are\r\ncapable of leading us on to the discovery of ulterior truths. To these,\r\ntherefore, we must appeal, carefully examining the strata of recent\r\nformation wherein the remains of _living_ species, both animal and\r\nvegetable, are known to occur. We must study these strata in strict\r\nreference to their chronological order, as deduced from their\r\nsuperposition, and other relations. From these sources we may learn\r\nwhich of the species, now our contemporaries, have survived the greatest\r\nrevolutions of the earth's surface; which of them have co-existed with\r\nthe greatest number of animals and plants now extinct; and which have\r\nmade their appearance only when the animate world had nearly attained\r\nits present condition.\r\n\r\nFrom such data we may be enabled to infer, whether species have been\r\ncalled into existence in succession, or all at one period; whether\r\nsingly, or by groups simultaneously; whether the antiquity of man be as\r\nhigh as that of any of the inferior beings which now share the planet\r\nwith him, or whether the human species is one of the most recent of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nTo some of these questions we can even now return a satisfactory answer;\r\nand with regard to the rest, we have some data to guide conjecture, and\r\nto enable us to speculate with advantage: but in order to be fully\r\nqualified to enter upon such discussions the reader must study the ample\r\nbody of materials amassed by the industry of modern geologists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS PRODUCED BY THE POWERS OF VITALITY ON THE STATE OF THE EARTH'S\r\nSURFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Modifications in physical geography caused by organic beings--Why\r\n    the vegetable soil does not augment in thickness--The theory, that\r\n    vegetation is an antagonist power counterbalancing the degradation\r\n    caused by running water untenable--Conservative influence of\r\n    vegetation--Rain diminished by felling of forests--Distribution of\r\n    American forests dependent on direction of predominant\r\n    winds--Influence of man in modifying the physical geography of the\r\n    globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second branch of our inquiry, respecting changes of the organic\r\nworld, relates to the processes by which the remains of animals and\r\nplants become fossil, or, to speak still more generally, to all the\r\neffects produced by the powers of vitality on the surface and shell of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the principal division of this subject, the imbedding\r\nand preservation of animal and vegetable remains, I shall offer a few\r\nremarks on the superficial modifications caused directly by the agency\r\nof organic beings, as when the growth of certain plants covers the slope\r\nof a mountain with peat, or converts a swamp into dry land; or when\r\nvegetation prevents the soil, in certain localities, from being washed\r\naway by running water.\r\n\r\nIn considering alterations of this kind, brought about in the physical\r\ngeography of particular tracts, we are too apt to think exclusively of\r\nthat part of the earth's surface which has emerged from beneath the\r\nwaters, and with which alone, as terrestrial beings, we are familiar.\r\nHere the direct power of animals and plants to cause any important\r\nvariation is, of necessity, very limited, except in checking the\r\nprogress of that decay of which the land is the chief theatre. But if we\r\nextend our views, and instead of contemplating the dry land, consider\r\nthat larger portion which is assigned to the aquatic tribes, we discover\r\nthe great influence of the living creation, in imparting varieties of\r\nconformation to the solid exterior which the agency of inanimate causes\r\nalone could not produce.\r\n\r\nThus, when timber is floated into the sea, it is often drifted to vast\r\ndistances, and subsides in spots where there might have been no deposit,\r\nat that time and place, if the earth had not been tenanted by living\r\nbeings. If, therefore, in the course of ages, a hill of wood, or\r\nlignite, be thus formed in the subaqueous regions, a change in the\r\nsubmarine geography may be said to have resulted from the action of\r\norganic powers. So in regard to the growth of coral reefs; it is\r\nprobable that a large portion of the matter of which they are composed\r\nis supplied by mineral springs, which often rise up at the bottom of the\r\nsea, and which, on land, abound throughout volcanic regions hundreds of\r\nleagues in extent. The matter thus constantly given out could not go on\r\naccumulating for ever in the waters, but would be precipitated in the\r\nabysses of the sea, even if there were no polyps and testacea; but these\r\nanimals arrest and secrete the carbonate of lime on the summits of\r\nsubmarine mountains, and form reefs many hundred feet in thickness, and\r\nhundreds of miles in length, where, but for them, none might ever have\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\n_Why the vegetable soil does not augment in thickness._--If no such\r\nvoluminous masses are formed on the land, it is not from the want of\r\nsolid matter in the structure of terrestrial animals and plants; but\r\nmerely because, as I have so often stated, the continents are those\r\nparts of the globe where accessions of matter can scarcely ever take\r\nplace--where, on the contrary, the most solid parts already formed are,\r\neach in their turn, exposed to gradual degradation. The quantity of\r\ntimber and vegetable matter which grows in a tropical forest in the\r\ncourse of a century is enormous, and multitudes of animal skeletons are\r\nscattered there during the same period, besides innumerable land shells\r\nand other organic substances. The aggregate of these materials,\r\ntherefore, might constitute a mass greater in volume than that which is\r\nproduced in any coral-reef during the same lapse of years; but, although\r\nthis process should continue on the land for ever, no mountains of wood\r\nor bone would be seen stretching far and wide over the country, or\r\npushing out bold promontories into the sea. The whole solid mass is\r\neither devoured by animals, or decomposes, as does a portion of the rock\r\nand soil on which the animals and plants are supported.\r\n\r\nThe waste of the strata themselves, accompanied by the decomposition of\r\ntheir organic remains, and the setting free of their alkaline\r\ningredients, is one source from whence running water and the atmosphere\r\nmay derive the materials which are absorbed by the roots and leaves of\r\nplants. Another source is the passage into a gaseous form of even the\r\nhardest parts of animals and plants which die and putrefy in the air,\r\nwhere they are soon resolved into the elements of which they are\r\ncomposed: and while a portion of these constituents is volatilized, the\r\nrest is taken up by rain-water, and sinks into the earth, or flows\r\ntowards the sea; so that they enter again and again into the composition\r\nof different organic beings.\r\n\r\nThe principal elements found in plants are hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen;\r\nso that water and the atmosphere contain all of them, either in their\r\nown composition or in solution.[994] The constant supply of these\r\nelements is maintained not only by the putrefaction of animal and\r\nvegetable substances, and the decay of rocks, but also by the copious\r\nevolution of carbonic acid and other gases from volcanoes and mineral\r\nsprings, and by the effects of ordinary evaporation, whereby aqueous\r\nvapors are made to rise from the ocean, and to circulate round the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, that when two gases of different specific gravity are\r\nbrought into contact, even though the heavier be the lowermost, they\r\nsoon become uniformly diffused by mutual absorption through the whole\r\nspace which they occupy. By virtue of this law, the heavy carbonic acid\r\nfinds its way upwards through the lighter air of the atmosphere, and\r\nconveys nourishment to the lichen which covers the mountain top.\r\n\r\nIf the quantity of food consumed by terrestrial animals, and the\r\nelements imbibed by the roots and leaves of plants, were derived\r\nentirely from that supply of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and\r\nother elements, given out into the atmosphere and the waters by the\r\nputrescence of organic substances, then we might imagine that the\r\nvegetable mould would, after a series of years, neither gain nor lose a\r\nsingle particle by the action of organic beings; and this conclusion is\r\nnot far from the truth; but the operation which renovates the vegetable\r\nand animal mould is by no means so simple as that here supposed.\r\nThousands of carcases of terrestrial animals are floated down, every\r\ncentury, into the sea; and, together with forests of drift-timber, are\r\nimbedded in subaqueous deposits, where their elements are imprisoned in\r\nsolid strata, and may there remain locked up throughout whole geological\r\nepochs before they again become subservient to the purposes of life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, fresh supplies are derived by the atmosphere and by\r\nrunning water, as before stated, from the disintegration of rocks and\r\ntheir organic contents, and through the agency of mineral springs from\r\nthe interior of the earth, from whence all the elements before\r\nmentioned, which enter principally into the composition of animals and\r\nvegetables, are continually evolved. Even nitrogen is found, by\r\nchemists, to be contained very generally in the waters of mineral\r\nsprings.\r\n\r\n_Vegetation not an antagonist power counterbalancing the action of\r\nrunning water._--If we suppose that the copious supply from the nether\r\nregions, by springs and volcanic vents, of carbonic acid and other\r\ngases, together with the decomposition of rocks, may be just sufficient\r\nto counterbalance that loss of matter which, having already served for\r\nthe nourishment of animals and plants, is annually carried down in\r\norganized forms, and buried in subaqueous strata, we concede the utmost\r\nthat is consistent with probability. An opinion, however, has been\r\nexpressed, that the processes of vegetable life, by absorbing various\r\ngases from the atmosphere, cause so large a mass of solid matter to\r\naccumulate on the surface of the land, that this mass alone may\r\nconstitute a great counterpoise to all the matter transported to lower\r\nlevels by the aqueous agents of decay. \"Torrents and rivers,\" it is\r\nsaid--\"the waves of the sea and marine currents--act upon lines only;\r\nbut the power of vegetation to absorb the elastic and non-elastic fluids\r\ncirculating round the earth, extends over the whole surface of the\r\ncontinents. By the silent but universal action of this great antagonist\r\npower, the spoliation and waste caused by running water on the land,\r\nand by the movements of the ocean, are neutralized, and even\r\ncounterbalanced.\"[995]\r\n\r\nIn opposition to these views, I conceive that we shall form a juster\r\nestimate of the influence of vegetation, if we consider it as being in a\r\nslight degree conservative, and capable of retarding the waste of land,\r\nbut not of acting as an antagonist power. The vegetable mould is seldom\r\nmore than a few feet in thickness, and frequently does not exceed a few\r\ninches; and we by no means find that its volume is more considerable on\r\nthose parts of our continents which we can prove, by geological data, to\r\nhave been elevated at more ancient periods, and where, consequently,\r\nthere has been the greatest time for the accumulation of vegetable\r\nmatter, produced throughout successive zoological epochs. On the\r\ncontrary, these higher and older regions are more frequently denuded, so\r\nas to expose the bare rock to the action of the sun and air.\r\n\r\nWe find in the torrid zone, where the growth of plants is most rank and\r\nluxurious, that accessions of matter due to their agency are by no means\r\nthe most conspicuous. Indeed it is in these latitudes, where the\r\nvegetation is most active, that, for reasons to be explained in the next\r\nchapter, even those superficial peat mosses are unknown which cover a\r\nlarge area in some parts of our temperate zone. If the operation of\r\nanimal and vegetable life could restore to the general surface of the\r\ncontinents a portion of the elements of those disintegrated rocks of\r\nwhich such enormous masses are swept down annually into the sea, the\r\neffects would long ere this have constituted one of the most striking\r\nfeatures in the structure and composition of our continents. All the\r\ngreat steppes and table-lands of the world, where the action of running\r\nwater is feeble, would have become the grand repositories of organic\r\nmatter, accumulated without that intermixture of earthy sediment which\r\nso generally characterizes the subaqueous strata.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that, in the known operation of the _igneous_\r\ncauses, a real antagonist power is found, which may counterbalance the\r\nlevelling action of running water (p. 563); and there seems no good\r\nreason for presuming that the upheaving and depressing force of\r\nearthquakes, together with the ejection of matter by volcanoes, may not\r\nbe fully adequate to restore that inequality of the surface which rivers\r\nand the waves and currents of the ocean annually tend to lessen. If a\r\ncounterpoise be derived from this source, the quantity and elevation of\r\nland above the sea may for ever remain the same, in spite of the action\r\nof the aqueous causes, which, if thus counteracted, may never be able to\r\nreduce the surface of the earth more nearly to a state of equilibrium\r\nthan that which it has now attained; and, on the other hand, the force\r\nof the aqueous agents themselves might thus continue for ever\r\nunimpaired.\r\n\r\n_Conservative influence of vegetation._--If, then, vegetation cannot act\r\nas an antagonist power amid the mighty agents of change which are always\r\nmodifying the surface of the globe, let us next inquire how far its\r\ninfluence is conservative,--how far it may retard the levelling effects\r\nof running water, which it cannot oppose, much less counterbalance.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that a covering of herbage and shrubs may protect a\r\nloose soil from being carried away by rain, or even by the ordinary\r\naction of a river, and may prevent hills of loose sand from being blown\r\naway by the wind; for the roots bind together the separate particles\r\ninto a firm mass, and the leaves intercept the rain-water, so that it\r\ndries up gradually, instead of flowing off in a mass and with great\r\nvelocity. The old Italian hydrographers make frequent mention of the\r\nincreased degradation which has followed the clearing away of natural\r\nwoods in several parts of Italy. A remarkable example was afforded in\r\nthe Upper Val d' Arno, in Tuscany, on the removal of the woods clothing\r\nthe steep declivities of the hills by which that valley is bounded. When\r\nthe ancient forest laws were abolished by the Grand Duke Joseph, during\r\nthe last century, a considerable tract of surface in the Cassentina (the\r\nClausentinium of the Romans) was denuded, and immediately the quantity\r\nof sand and soil washed down into the Arno increased enormously. Frisi,\r\nalluding to such occurrences, observes, that as soon as the bushes and\r\nplants were removed, the waters flowed off more rapidly, and, in the\r\nmanner of floods, swept away the vegetable soil.[996]\r\n\r\nThis effect of vegetation is of high interest to the geologist, when he\r\nis considering the formation of those valleys which have been\r\nprincipally due to the action of rivers. The spaces intervening between\r\nvalleys, whether they be flat or ridgy, when covered with vegetation,\r\nmay scarcely undergo the slightest waste, as the surface may be\r\nprotected by the green sward of grass; and this may be renewed, in the\r\nmanner before described, from elements derived from rain-water and the\r\natmosphere. Hence, while the river is continually bearing down matter in\r\nthe alluvial plain, and undermining the cliffs on each side of every\r\nvalley, the height of the intervening rising grounds may remain\r\nstationary.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, a cone of loose scoriae, sand, and ashes, such as Monte\r\nNuovo, may, when it has once become densely clothed with herbage and\r\nshrubs, suffer scarcely any further dilapidation; and the perfect state\r\nof the cones of hundreds of extinct volcanoes in France, the Neapolitan\r\nterritory, Sicily, and elsewhere, may prove nothing whatever, either as\r\nto their relative or absolute antiquity. We may be enabled to infer,\r\nfrom the integrity of such conical hills of incoherent materials, that\r\nno flood can have passed over the countries where they are situated,\r\nsince their formation; but the atmospheric action alone, in spots where\r\nthere happen to be no torrents, and where the surface was clothed with\r\nvegetation, could scarcely in any lapse of ages have destroyed them.\r\n\r\nDuring a tour in Spain, in 1830, I was surprised to see a district of\r\ngently undulating ground in Catalonia, consisting of red and gray\r\nsandstone, and in some parts of red marl, almost entirely denuded of\r\nherbage; while the roots of the pines, holm oaks, and some other trees,\r\nwere half exposed, as if the soil had been washed away by a flood. Such\r\nis the state of the forests, for example, between Oristo and Vich, and\r\nnear San Lorenzo. But, being overtaken by a violent thunder-storm, in\r\nthe month of August, I saw the whole surface, even the highest levels of\r\nsome flat-topped hills, streaming with mud, while on every declivity the\r\ndevastation of torrents was terrific. The peculiarities in the\r\nphysiognomy of the district were at once explained; and I was taught\r\nthat, in speculating on the greater effects which the direct action of\r\nrain may once have produced on the surface of certain parts of England,\r\nwe need not revert to periods when the heat of the climate was\r\n_tropical_.\r\n\r\nIn the torrid zone the degradation of land is generally more rapid; but\r\nthe waste is by no means proportioned to the superior quantity of rain\r\nor the suddenness of its fall, the transporting power of water being\r\ncounteracted by a greater luxuriance of vegetation. A geologist who is\r\nno stranger to tropical countries observes, that the softer rocks would\r\nspeedily be washed away in such regions, if the numerous roots of plants\r\nwere not matted together in such a manner as to produce considerable\r\nresistance to the destructive power of the rains. The parasitical and\r\ncreeping plants also entwine in every possible direction, so as to\r\nrender the forests nearly impervious, and the trees possess forms and\r\nleaves best calculated to shoot off the heavy rains; which, when they\r\nhave thus been broken in their fall, are quickly absorbed by the ground\r\nbeneath, or, when thrown into the drainage depressions, give rise to\r\nfurious torrents.[997]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Influence of Man in modifying the Physical Geography of the Globe._\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this chapter, I shall offer a few observations on the\r\ninfluence of man in modifying the physical geography of the globe; for\r\nwe must class his agency among the powers of organic nature.\r\n\r\n_Felling of forests._--The felling of forests has been attended, in many\r\ncountries, by a diminution of rain, as in Barbadoes and Jamaica.[998]\r\nFor in tropical countries, where the quantity of aqueous vapor in the\r\natmosphere is great, but where, on the other hand, the direct rays of\r\nthe sun are most powerful, any impediment to the free circulation of\r\nair, or any screen which shades the earth from the solar rays, becomes a\r\nsource of humidity; and wherever dampness and cold have begun to be\r\ngenerated by such causes, the condensation of vapor continues. The\r\nleaves, moreover, of all plants are alembics, and some of those in the\r\ntorrid zone have the remarkable property of distilling water, thus\r\ncontributing to prevent the earth from becoming parched up.\r\n\r\n_Distribution of the American forests._--There can be no doubt then,\r\nthat the state of the climate, especially the humidity of the\r\natmosphere, influences vegetation, and that, in its turn, vegetation\r\nre-acts upon the climate: but some writers seem to have attributed too\r\nmuch importance to the influence of forests, particularly those of\r\nAmerica, as if they were the primary cause of the moisture of the\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nThe theory of a modern author on this subject \"that forests exist in\r\nthose parts of America only where the predominant winds carry with them\r\na considerable quantity of moisture from the ocean,\" seems far more\r\nrational. In all countries, he says, \"having a summer heat exceeding\r\n70 degrees, the presence or absence of natural woods, and their greater\r\nor less luxuriance, may be taken as a measure of the amount of humidity,\r\nand of the fertility of the soil. Short and heavy rains in a warm\r\ncountry will produce grass, which, having its roots near to the surface,\r\nsprings up in a few days, and withers when the moisture is exhausted;\r\nbut transitory rains, however heavy, will not nourish trees; because,\r\nafter the surface is saturated, the remainder of the water runs off, and\r\nthe moisture lodged in the soil neither sinks deep enough, nor is in\r\nsufficient quantity, to furnish the giants of the forests with the\r\nnecessary sustenance. It may be assumed that twenty inches of rain\r\nfalling moderately or at intervals, will leave a greater permanent\r\nsupply in the soil than forty inches falling, as it sometimes does in\r\nthe torrid zone, in as many hours.\"[999]\r\n\r\n\"In all regions,\" he continues, \"where ranges of mountains intercept the\r\ncourse of the constant or predominant winds, the country on the windward\r\nside of the mountains will be moist, and that on the leeward dry; and\r\nhence parched deserts will generally be found on the west side of\r\ncountries within the tropics, and on the east side of those beyond them,\r\nthe prevailing winds in these cases being generally in opposite\r\ndirections. On this principle, the position of forests in North and\r\nSouth America may be explained. Thus, for example, in the region within\r\nthe thirtieth parallel, the moisture swept up by the trade-wind from the\r\nAtlantic is precipitated in part upon the mountains of Brazil, which are\r\nbut low, and so distributed as to extend far into the interior. The\r\nportion which remains is borne westward, and, losing a little as it\r\nproceeds, is at length arrested by the Andes, where it falls down in\r\nshowers on their summits. The aarial current, now deprived of all the\r\nhumidity with which it can part, arrives in a state of complete\r\nexsiccation at Peru, where consequently no rain falls. But in the region\r\nof America, beyond the thirtieth parallel, the Andes serve as a screen\r\nto intercept the moisture brought by the prevailing winds from the\r\nPacific Ocean: rains are copious on their summits, and in Chili on their\r\n_western_ declivities; but none falls on the plains to the _eastward_,\r\nexcept occasionally when the wind blows from the Atlantic.\"[1000]\r\n\r\nI have been more particular in explaining these views, because they\r\nappear to place in a true light the dependence of vegetation on climate,\r\nthe humidity being increased, and more uniformly diffused throughout the\r\nyear, by the gradual spreading of wood.\r\n\r\nIt has been affirmed, that formerly, when France and England were\r\ncovered with wood, Europe was much colder than at present; that the\r\nwinters in Italy were longer, and that the Seine, and many other rivers,\r\nfroze more regularly every winter than now. M. Arago, in an essay on\r\nthis subject, has endeavored to show, by tables of observations on the\r\ncongelation of the Rhine, Danube, Rhone, Po, Seine, and other rivers, at\r\ndifferent periods, that there is no reason to believe the cold to have\r\nbeen in general more intense in ancient times.[1001] He admits, however,\r\nthat the climate of Tuscany has been so far modified, by the removal of\r\nwood, as that the winters are less cold; but the summers also, he\r\ncontends, are less hot than of old; and the summers, according to him,\r\nwere formerly hotter in France than in our own times. His evidence is\r\nderived chiefly from documents showing that wine was made three\r\ncenturies ago in the Vivarais and several other provinces, at an earlier\r\nseason, at greater elevations, and in higher latitudes, than are now\r\nfound suitable to the vine.\r\n\r\nThere seems little doubt that in the United States of North America the\r\nrapid _clearing_ of the country has rendered the winters less severe and\r\nthe summers less hot; in other words, the extreme temperatures of\r\nJanuary and July have been observed from year to year to approach\r\nsomewhat nearer to each other. Whether in this case, or in France, the\r\n_mean_ temperature has been raised, seems by no means as yet decided;\r\nbut there is no doubt that the climate has become, as Buffon would have\r\nsaid, \"less excessive.\"\r\n\r\nI have before shown, when treating of the excavation of new estuaries in\r\nHolland by inroads of the ocean, as also of the changes on our own\r\ncoasts, that although the conversion of sea into land by artificial\r\nlabors may be great, yet it must always be in subordination to the power\r\nof the tides and currents, or to the great movements which alter the\r\nrelative level of the land and sea, (Chap. XX.) If, in addition to the\r\nassistance obtained by parliamentary grants for defending Dunwich from\r\nthe waves, all the resources of Europe had been directed to the same\r\nend, the existence of that port might perhaps have been prolonged for\r\nseveral centuries (p. 310.) But in the mean time, the current would have\r\ncontinued to sweep away portions from the adjoining cliffs on each side,\r\ngiving to the whole line of coast its present form, until at length the\r\ntown, projecting as a narrow promontory, must have become exposed to the\r\nirresistible fury of the waves.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to observe, that the control which man can\r\nobtain over the igneous agents is less even than that which he may exert\r\nover the aqueous. He cannot modify the upheaving or depressing force of\r\nearthquakes, or the periods or degree of violence of volcanic eruptions;\r\nand on these causes the inequalities of the earth's surface, and,\r\nconsequently, the shape of the sea and land, appear mainly to depend.\r\nThe utmost that man can hope to effect in this respect is occasionally\r\nto divert the course of a lava-stream, and to prevent the burning\r\nmatter, for a season, from overwhelming a city, or some other of the\r\nproudest works of human industry.\r\n\r\nIf all the nations of the earth should attempt to quarry away the lava\r\nwhich flowed during one eruption from the Icelandic volcanoes in 1783,\r\nand the two following years, and should attempt to consign it to the\r\ndeepest abysses of the ocean, they might toil for thousands of years and\r\nnot accomplish their task. Yet the matter borne down to the sea by two\r\ngreat rivers, the Ganges and Burrampooter, in each quarter of a century,\r\nprobably equals in weight and volume the mass of Icelandic lava produced\r\nby that great eruption (p. 282). So insignificant is the aggregate force\r\nexerted by man, when contrasted with the ordinary operations of aqueous\r\nor igneous agents in the natural world.\r\n\r\nNo application, perhaps, of human skill and labor tends so greatly to\r\nvary the state of the habitable surface, as that employed in the\r\ndrainage of lakes and marshes, since not only the _stations_ of many\r\nanimals and plants, but the general climate of a district, may thus be\r\nmodified. It is also a kind of alteration to which it is difficult to\r\nfind anything analogous in the agency of inferior beings; for we ought\r\nalways, before we decide that any part of the influence of man is novel\r\nand anomalous, carefully to consider the powers of all other animated\r\nagents which may be limited or superseded by him.[1002] Many who have\r\nreasoned on these subjects seem to have forgotten that the human race\r\noften succeeds to the discharge of functions previously fulfilled by\r\nother species. Suppose the growth of some of the larger terrestrial\r\nplants, or, in other words, the extent of forest, to be diminished by\r\nman, and the climate to be thereby modified, it does not follow that\r\nthis kind of innovation is unprecedented. It is a change in the state of\r\nvegetation, and such may often have been the result of the appearance of\r\nnew species upon the earth. The multiplication, for example, of certain\r\ninsects in parts of Germany, during the last century, destroyed more\r\ntrees than man, perhaps, could have felled during an equal period.\r\n\r\nIt would be rash, however, to affirm that the power of man to modify the\r\nsurface may not differ in kind or degree from that of other living\r\nbeings; although the problem is certainly more complex than many who\r\nhave speculated on such topics have imagined. If land be raised from the\r\nsea, the greatest alteration in its physical condition, which could ever\r\narise from the influence of organic beings, would probably be produced\r\nby the first immigration of terrestrial plants, whereby the new tract\r\nwould become covered with vegetation. The change next in importance\r\nwould seem to be when animals first enter, and modify the proportionate\r\nnumbers of certain species of plants. If there be any anomaly in the\r\nintervention of man, in farther varying the relative numbers in the\r\nvegetable kingdom, it may not so much consist in the kind or absolute\r\nquantity of alteration, as in the circumstance that a _single species_,\r\nin this case, would exert, by its superior power and universal\r\ndistribution, an influence equal to that of hundreds of other\r\nterrestrial animals.\r\n\r\nIf we inquire whether man, by his direct power, or by the changes which\r\nhe may give rise to indirectly, tends, upon the whole, to lessen or\r\nincrease the inequalities of the earth's surface, we shall incline,\r\nperhaps, to the opinion that he is a levelling agent. In mining\r\noperations he conveys upwards a certain quantity of materials from the\r\nbowels of the earth; but, on the other hand, much rock is taken annually\r\nfrom the land, in the shape of ballast, and afterwards thrown into the\r\nsea, and by this means, in spite of prohibitory laws, many harbors, in\r\nvarious parts of the world, have been blocked up. We rarely transport\r\nheavy materials to higher levels, and our pyramids and cities are\r\nchiefly constructed of stone brought down from more elevated situations.\r\nBy ploughing up thousands of square miles, and exposing a surface for\r\npart of the year to the action of the elements, we assist the abrading\r\nforce of rain, and diminish the conservative effects of vegetation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nINCLOSING OF FOSSILS IN PEAT, BROWN SAND, AND VOLCANIC EJECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Division of the subject--Imbedding of organic remains in deposits on\r\n    emerged land--Growth of peat--Site of ancient forests in Europe now\r\n    occupied by peat--Bog iron-ore--Preservation of animal substances in\r\n    peat--Miring of quadrupeds--Bursting of the Solway moss--Great\r\n    Dismal Swamp--Imbedding of organic bodies and human remains in blown\r\n    sand--Moving sands of African deserts--De Luc on their recent\r\n    origin--Buried temple of Ipsambul--Dried carcases in the\r\n    sands--Towns overwhelmed by sand-floods--Imbedding of organic and\r\n    other remains in volcanic formations on the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Division of the subject._--The next subject of inquiry is the mode in\r\nwhich the remains of animals and plants become fossil, or are buried in\r\nthe earth by natural causes. M. Constant Prevost has observed, that the\r\neffects of geological causes are divisible into two great classes; those\r\nproduced during the submersion of land beneath the waters, and those\r\nwhich take place after its emersion. Agreeably to this classification, I\r\nshall consider, first, in what manner animal and vegetable remains\r\nbecome included and preserved in deposits on emerged land, or that part\r\nof the surface which is not _permanently_ covered by water, whether of\r\nseas or lakes; secondly, the manner in which organic remains become\r\nimbedded in subaqueous deposits.\r\n\r\nUnder the first division, I shall treat of the following topics:--1st,\r\nthe growth of peat, and the preservation of vegetable and animal remains\r\ntherein;--2dly, the burying of organic remains in blown sand;--3dly, of\r\nthe same in the ejections and alluviums of volcanoes;--4thly, in\r\nalluviums generally, and in the ruins of landslips;--5thly, in the mud\r\nand stalagmite of caves and fissures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Growth of Peat, and Preservation of Vegetable and Animal Remains\r\ntherein._\r\n\r\nThe generation of peat, when not completely under water, is confined to\r\nmoist situations, where the temperature is low, and where vegetables may\r\ndecompose without putrefying. It may consist of any of the numerous\r\nplants which are capable of growing in such _stations_; but a species of\r\nmoss (_Sphagnum_) constitutes a considerable part of the peat found in\r\nmarshes of the north of Europe; this plant having the property of\r\nthrowing up new shoots in its upper part, while its lower extremities\r\nare decaying.[1003] Reeds, rushes, and other aquatic plants may usually\r\nbe traced in peat; and their organization is often so entire that there\r\nis no difficulty in discriminating the distinct species.\r\n\r\n_Analysis of peat._--In general, says Sir H. Davy, one hundred parts of\r\ndry peat contain from sixty to ninety-nine parts of matter destructible\r\nby fire; and the residuum consists of earths usually of the same kind as\r\nthe substratum of clay, marl, gravel, or rock, on which they are found,\r\ntogether with oxide of iron. \"The peat of the chalk counties of\r\nEngland,\" observes the same writer, \"contains much gypsum: but I have\r\nfound very little in any specimens from Ireland or Scotland, and in\r\ngeneral these peats contain very little saline matter.\"[1004] From the\r\nresearches of Dr. MacCulloch, it appears that peat is intermediate\r\nbetween simple vegetable matter and lignite, the conversion of peat to\r\nlignite being gradual, and being brought about by a prolonged action of\r\nwater.[1005]\r\n\r\n_Peat abundant in cold and humid climates._--Peat is sometimes formed on\r\na declivity in mountainous regions, where there is much moisture; but in\r\nsuch situations it rarely, if ever, exceeds four feet in thickness. In\r\nbogs, and in low grounds into which alluvial peat is drifted, it is\r\nfound forty feet thick, and upwards; but in such cases it generally owes\r\none half of its volume to the water which it contains. It has seldom, if\r\never, been discovered within the tropics; and it rarely occurs in the\r\nvalleys, even in the south of France and Spain. It abounds more and\r\nmore, in proportion as we advance farther from the equator, and becomes\r\nnot only more frequent but more inflammable in northern latitudes.[1006]\r\n\r\nThe same phenomenon is repeated in the southern hemisphere. No peat is\r\nfound in Brazil, nor even in the swampy parts of the country drained by\r\nthe La Plata on the east side of South America, or in the island of\r\nChiloe on the west; yet when we reach the 45th degree of latitude and\r\nexamine the Chonos Archipelago or the Falkland Islands, and Tierra del\r\nFuego, we meet with an abundant growth of this substance. Almost all\r\nplants contribute here by their decay to the production of peat, even\r\nthe grasses; but it is a singular fact, says Mr. Darwin, as contrasted\r\nwith what occurs in Europe, that no kind of moss enters into the\r\ncomposition of the South American peat, which is formed by many plants,\r\nbut chiefly by that called by Brown _Astelia pumila_.[1007]\r\n\r\nI learn from Dr. Forchhammer (1849) that water charged with vegetable\r\nmatter in solution does not throw down a deposit of peat in countries\r\nwhere the mean temperature of the year is above 43 degrees or 44 degrees\r\nFahrenheit. Frost causes the precipitation of such peaty matter, but in\r\nwarm climates the attraction of the carbon for the oxygen of the air\r\nmechanically mixed with the water increases with the increasing\r\ntemperature, and the dissolved vegetable matter or humic acid (which is\r\norganic matter in a progressive state of decomposition) being converted\r\ninto carbonic acid, rises and is absorbed into the atmosphere, and thus\r\ndisappears.\r\n\r\n_Extent of surface covered by peat._--There is a vast extent of surface\r\nin Europe covered with peat, which, in Ireland, is said to extend over a\r\ntenth of the whole island. One of the mosses on the Shannon is described\r\nas being fifty miles long, by two or three broad; and the great marsh of\r\nMontoire, near the mouth of the Loire, is mentioned, by Blavier, as\r\nbeing more than fifty leagues in circumference. It is a curious and\r\nwell-ascertained fact, that many of these mosses of the north of Europe\r\noccupy the place of forests of pine and oak, which have, many of them,\r\ndisappeared within the historical era. Such changes are brought about by\r\nthe fall of trees and the stagnation of water, caused by their trunks\r\nand branches obstructing the free drainage of the atmospheric waters,\r\nand giving rise to a marsh. In a warm climate, such decayed timber would\r\nimmediately be removed by insects, or by putrefaction; but, in the cold\r\ntemperature now prevailing in our latitudes, many examples are recorded\r\nof marshes originating in this source. Thus, in Mar forest, in\r\nAberdeenshire, large trunks of Scotch fir, which had fallen from age and\r\ndecay, were soon immured in peat, formed partly out of their perishing\r\nleaves and branches, and in part from the growth of other plants. We\r\nalso learn, that the overthrow of a forest by a storm, about the middle\r\nof the seventeenth century, gave rise to a peat-moss near Lochbroom, in\r\nRoss-shire, where, in less than half a century after the fall of the\r\ntrees, the inhabitants dug peat.[1008] Dr. Walker mentions a similar\r\nchange, when, in the year 1756, the whole wood of Drumlaurig in\r\nDumfries-shire was overset by the wind. Such events explain the\r\noccurrence, both in Britain and on the Continent, of mosses where the\r\ntrees are all broken within two or three feet of the original surface,\r\nand where their trunks all lie in the same direction.[1009]\r\n\r\nIt may however be suggested in these cases, that the soil had become\r\nexhausted for trees, and that, on the principle of that natural rotation\r\nwhich prevails in the vegetable world, one set of plants died out and\r\nanother succeeded. It is certainly a remarkable fact that in the Danish\r\nislands, and in Jutland and Holstein, fir wood of various species,\r\nespecially Scotch fir, is found at the bottom of the peat-mosses,\r\nalthough it is well ascertained that for the last five centuries no\r\nConiferae have grown wild in these countries; the coniferous trees which\r\nnow flourish there having been all planted towards the close of the last\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nNothing is more common than the occurrence of buried trees at the bottom\r\nof the Irish peat-mosses, as also in most of those of England, France,\r\nand Holland; and they have been so often observed with parts of their\r\ntrunks standing erect, and with their roots fixed to the subsoil, that\r\nno doubt can be entertained of their having generally grown on the spot.\r\nThey consist, for the most part, of the fir, the oak, and the birch:\r\nwhere the subsoil is clay, the remains of oak are the most abundant;\r\nwhere sand is the substratum, fir prevails. In the marsh of Curragh, in\r\nthe Isle of Man, vast trees are discovered standing firm on their\r\nroots, though at the depth of eighteen or twenty feet below the surface.\r\nSome naturalists have desired to refer the imbedding of timber in\r\npeat-mosses to aqueous transportation, since rivers are well known to\r\nfloat wood into lakes; but the facts above mentioned show that, in\r\nnumerous instances, such an hypothesis is inadmissible. It has,\r\nmoreover, been observed, that in Scotland, as also in many parts of the\r\nContinent, the largest trees are found in those peat-mosses which lie in\r\nthe least elevated regions, and that the trees are proportionally\r\nsmaller in those which lie at higher levels; from which fact De Luc and\r\nWalker have both inferred that the trees grew on the spot, for they\r\nwould naturally attain a greater size in lower and warmer levels. The\r\nleaves, also, and fruits of each species, are continually found immersed\r\nin the moss along with the parent trees; as, for example, the leaves and\r\nacorns of the oak, the cones and leaves of the fir, and the nuts of the\r\nhazel.\r\n\r\n_Recent origin of some peat-mosses._--In Hatfield moss, in Yorkshire,\r\nwhich appears clearly to have been a forest eighteen hundred years ago,\r\nfir-trees have been found ninety feet long, and sold for masts and keels\r\nof ships; oaks have also been discovered there above one hundred feet\r\nlong. The dimensions of an oak from this moss are given in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions, No. 275, which must have been larger than\r\nany tree now existing in the British dominions.\r\n\r\nIn the same moss of Hatfield, as well as in that of Kincardine, in\r\nScotland, and several others, Roman roads have been found covered to the\r\ndepth of eight feet by peat. All the coins, axes, arms, and other\r\nutensils found in British and French mosses, are also Roman; so that a\r\nconsiderable portion of the peat in European peat-bogs is evidently not\r\nmore ancient than the age of Julius Caesar. Nor can any vestiges of the\r\nancient forests described by that general, along the line of the great\r\nRoman way in Britain, be discovered, except in the ruined trunks of\r\ntrees in peat.\r\n\r\nDe Luc ascertained that the very sites of the aboriginal forests of\r\nHercinia, Semana, Ardennes, and several others, are now occupied by\r\nmosses and fens; and a great part of these changes have, with much\r\nprobability, been attributed to the strict orders given by Severus, and\r\nother emperors, to destroy all the wood in the conquered provinces.\r\nSeveral of the British forests, however, which are now mosses, were cut\r\nat different periods, by order of the English parliament, because they\r\nharbored wolves or outlaws. Thus the Welsh woods were cut and burned, in\r\nthe reign of Edward I.; as were many of those in Ireland, by Henry II.,\r\nto prevent the natives from harboring in them, and harassing his troops.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to reflect that considerable tracts have, by these\r\naccidents, been permanently sterilized, and that, during a period when\r\ncivilization has been making great progress, large areas in Europe have,\r\nby human agency, been rendered less capable of administering to the\r\nwants of man. Rennie observes,[1010] with truth, that in those regions\r\nalone which the Roman eagle never reached--in the remote circles of the\r\nGerman empire, in Poland and Prussia, and still more in Norway, Sweden,\r\nand the vast empire of Russia--can we see what Europe was before it\r\nyielded to the power of Rome. Desolation now reigns where stately\r\nforests of pine and oak once flourished, such as might now have supplied\r\nall the navies of Europe with timber.\r\n\r\n_Sources of bog iron-ore._--At the bottom of peat-mosses there is\r\nsometimes found a cake, or \"pan,\" as it is termed, of oxide of iron, and\r\nthe frequency of bog iron-ore is familiar to the mineralogist. The oak,\r\nwhich is so often dyed black in peat, owes its color to the same metal.\r\nFrom what source the iron is derived has often been a subject of\r\ndiscussion, until the discoveries of Ehrenberg seem at length to have\r\nremoved the difficulty. He had observed in the marshes about Berlin a\r\nsubstance of a deep ochre yellow passing into red, which covered the\r\nbottom of the ditches, and which, where it had become dry after the\r\nevaporation of the water, appeared exactly like oxide of iron. But under\r\nthe microscope it was found to consist of slender articulated threads or\r\nplates, partly siliceous and partly ferruginous, of what he considered\r\nan animalcule, _Gaillonella ferruginea_, but which most naturalists now\r\nregard as a plant.[1011] There can be little doubt, therefore, that bog\r\niron-ore consists of an aggregate of millions of these organic bodies\r\ninvisible to the naked eye.[1012]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.\r\n\r\n_Gaillonella ferruginea._\r\n\r\n_a._ 2000 times magnified.]\r\n\r\n_Preservation of animal substances in peat._--One interesting\r\ncircumstance attending the history of peat mosses is the high state of\r\npreservation of animal substances buried in them for periods of many\r\nyears. In June, 1747, the body of a woman was found six feet deep, in a\r\npeat-moor in the Isle of Axholm, in Lincolnshire. The antique sandals\r\non her feet afforded evidence of her having been buried there for many\r\nages: yet her nails, hair, and skin, are described as having shown\r\nhardly any marks of decay. On the estate of the Earl of Moira, in\r\nIreland, a human body was dug up, a foot deep in gravel, covered with\r\neleven feet of moss; the body was completely clothed and the garments\r\nseemed all to be made of hair. Before the use of wool was known in that\r\ncountry the clothing of the inhabitants was made of hair, so that it\r\nwould appear that this body had been buried at that early period; yet it\r\nwas fresh and unimpaired.[1013] In the Philosophical Transactions we\r\nfind an example recorded of the bodies of two persons having been buried\r\nin moist peat, in Derbyshire, in 1674, about a yard deep, which were\r\nexamined twenty-eight years and nine months afterwards; \"the color of\r\ntheir skin was fair and natural, their flesh soft as that of persons\r\nnewly dead.\"[1014]\r\n\r\nAmong other analogous facts we may mention, that in digging a pit for a\r\nwell near Dulverton, in Somersetshire, many pigs were found in various\r\npostures, still entire. Their shape was well preserved, the skin, which\r\nretained the hair, having assumed a dry, membranous appearance. Their\r\nwhole substance was converted into a white, friable, laminated,\r\ninodorous, and tasteless substance; but which, when exposed to heat,\r\nemitted an odor precisely similar to broiled bacon.[1015]\r\n\r\n_Cause of the antiseptic property of peat._--We naturally ask whence\r\npeat derives this antiseptic property? It has been attributed by some to\r\nthe carbonic and gallic acids which issue from decayed wood, as also to\r\nthe presence of charred wood in the lowest strata of many peat-mosses,\r\nfor charcoal is a powerful antiseptic, and capable of purifying water\r\nalready putrid. Vegetable gums and resins also may operate in the same\r\nway.[1016]\r\n\r\nThe tannin occasionally present in peat is the produce, says Dr.\r\nMacCulloch, of tormentilla, and some other plants; but the quantity he\r\nthinks too small, and its occurrence too casual, to give rise to effects\r\nof any importance. He hints that the soft parts of animal bodies,\r\npreserved in peat-bogs, may have been converted into adipocire by the\r\naction of water merely; an explanation which appears clearly applicable\r\nto some of the cases above enumerated.[1017]\r\n\r\n_Miring of quadrupeds._--The manner, however, in which peat contributes\r\nto preserve, for indefinite periods, the harder parts of terrestrial\r\nanimals, is a subject of more immediate interest to the geologist. There\r\nare two ways in which animals become occasionally buried in the peat of\r\nmarshy grounds; they either sink down into the semifluid mud, underlying\r\na turfy surface upon which they have rashly ventured, or, at other\r\ntimes, as we shall see in the sequel, a bog \"bursts,\" and animals may be\r\ninvolved in the peaty alluvium.\r\n\r\nIn the extensive bogs of Newfoundland, cattle are sometimes found buried\r\nwith only their heads and necks above ground; and after having remained\r\nfor days in this situation, they have been drawn out by ropes and saved.\r\nIn Scotland, also, cattle venturing on the \"quaking moss\" are often\r\nmired, or \"laired,\" as it is termed; and in Ireland, Mr. King asserts\r\nthat the number of cattle which are lost in sloughs is quite\r\nincredible.[1018]\r\n\r\n_Solway moss._--The description given of the Solway moss will serve to\r\nillustrate the general character of these boggy grounds. That moss,\r\nobserves Gilpin, is a flat area, about seven miles in circumference,\r\nsituated on the western confines of England and Scotland. Its surface is\r\ncovered with grass and rushes, presenting a dry crust and a fair\r\nappearance; but it shakes under the least pressure, the bottom being\r\nunsound and semifluid. The adventurous passenger, therefore, who\r\nsometimes in dry seasons traverses this perilous waste, to save a few\r\nmiles, picks his cautious way over the rushy tussocks as they appear\r\nbefore him, for here the soil is firmest. If his foot slip, or if he\r\nventure to desert this mark of security, it is possible he may never\r\nmore be heard of.\r\n\r\n\"At the battle of Solway, in the time of Henry VIII. (1542), when the\r\nScotch army, commanded by Oliver Sinclair, was routed, an unfortunate\r\ntroop of horse, driven by their fears, plunged into this morass, which\r\ninstantly closed upon them. The tale was traditional, but it is now\r\nauthenticated; a man and horse, in complete armor, having been found by\r\npeat-diggers, in the place where it was always supposed the affair had\r\nhappened. The skeleton of each was well preserved, and the different\r\nparts of the armor easily distinguished.\"[1019]\r\n\r\nThe same moss, on the 16th of December, 1772, having been filled like a\r\ngreat sponge with water during heavy rains, swelled to an unusual height\r\nabove the surrounding country, and then burst. The turfy covering seemed\r\nfor a time to act like the skin of a bladder retaining the fluid within,\r\ntill it forced a passage for itself, when a stream of black\r\nhalf-consolidated mud began at first to creep over the plain,\r\nresembling, in the rate of its progress, an ordinary lava-current. No\r\nlives were lost, but the deluge totally overwhelmed some cottages, and\r\ncovered 400 acres. The highest parts of the original moss subsided to\r\nthe depth of about twenty-five feet; and the height of the moss, on the\r\nlowest parts of the country which it invaded, was at least fifteen feet.\r\n\r\n_Bursting of a peat-moss in Ireland._--A recent inundation in Sligo\r\n(January, 1831), affords another example of this phenomenon. After a\r\nsudden thaw of snow, the bog between Bloomfield and Geevah gave way; and\r\na black deluge, carrying with it the contents of a hundred acres of bog,\r\ntook the direction of a small stream and rolled on with the violence of\r\na torrent, sweeping along heath, timber, mud, and stones, and\r\noverwhelming many meadows and arable land. On passing through some boggy\r\nland, the flood swept out a wide and deep ravine, and part of the road\r\nleading from Bloomfield to St. James's Well was completely carried away\r\nfrom below the foundation for the breadth of 200 yards.\r\n\r\n_Great Dismal Swamp._--I have described, in my Travels in North\r\nAmerica,[1020] an extensive swamp or morass, forty miles long from north\r\nto south, and twenty-five wide, between the towns of Norfolk in\r\nVirginia, and Weldon in North Carolina. It is called the \"Great Dismal,\"\r\nand has somewhat the appearance of an inundated river-plain covered with\r\naquatic trees and shrubs, the soil being as black as that of a peat bog.\r\nIt is higher on all sides except one than the surrounding country,\r\ntowards which it sends forth streams of water to the north, east, and\r\nsouth, receiving a supply from the west only. In its centre it rises 12\r\nfeet above the flat region which bounds it. The soil, to the depth of 15\r\nfeet, is formed of vegetable matter without any admixture, of earthy\r\nparticles, and offers an exception to a general rule before alluded to,\r\nnamely, that such peaty accumulations scarcely ever occur so far south\r\nas lat. 36 degrees, or in any region where the summer heat is so great\r\nas in Virginia. In digging canals through the morass for the purpose of\r\nobtaining timber, much of the black soil has been thrown out from time\r\nto time, and exposed to the sun and air, in which case it soon rots away\r\nso that nothing remains behind, showing clearly that it owes its\r\npreservation to the shade afforded by a luxuriant vegetation and to the\r\nconstant evaporation of the spongy soil by which the air is cooled\r\nduring the hot months. The surface of the bog is carpeted with mosses,\r\nand densely covered with ferns and reeds, above which many evergreen\r\nshrubs and trees flourish, especially the White Cedar (_Cupressus\r\nthyoides_), which stands firmly supported by its long tap roots in the\r\nsoftest parts of the quagmire. Over the whole the deciduous cypress\r\n(_Taxodium distichum_) is seen to tower with its spreading top, in full\r\nleaf in the season when the sun's rays are hottest, and when, if not\r\nintercepted by a screen of foliage, they might soon cause the fallen\r\nleaves and dead plants of the preceding autumn to decompose, instead of\r\nadding their contributions to the peaty mass. On the surface of the wide\r\nmorass lie innumerable trunks of large and tall trees, while thousands\r\nof others, blown down by the winds, are buried at various depths in the\r\nblack mire below. They remind the geologist of the prostrate position of\r\nlarge stems of Sigillaria and Lepidodendron, converted into coal in\r\nancient carboniferous rocks.\r\n\r\n_Bones of herbivorous quadrupeds in peat._--The antlers of large and\r\nfull-grown stags are amongst the most common and conspicuous remains of\r\nanimals in peat. They are not horns which have been shed; for portions\r\nof the skull are found attached, proving that the whole animal perished.\r\nBones of the ox, hog, horse, sheep, and other herbivorous animals, also\r\noccur. M. Morren has discovered in the peat of Flanders the bones of\r\notters and beavers[1021]; but no remains have been met with belonging to\r\nthose extinct quadrupeds, of which the living congeners inhabit warmer\r\nlatitudes, such as the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, hyaena, and\r\ntiger, though these are so common in superficial deposits of silt, mud,\r\nsand, or stalactite, in various districts throughout Great Britain.\r\nTheir absence seems to imply that they had ceased to live before the\r\natmosphere of this part of the world acquired that cold and humid\r\ncharacter which favors the growth of peat.\r\n\r\n_Remains of ships, &c., in peat mosses._--From the facts before\r\nmentioned, that mosses occasionally burst, and descend in a fluid state\r\nto lower levels, it will readily be seen that lakes and arms of the sea\r\nmay occasionally become the receptacles of drift peat. Of this,\r\naccordingly, there are numerous examples; and hence the alternations of\r\nclay and sand with different deposits of peat so frequent on some\r\ncoasts, as on those of the Baltic and German Ocean. We are informed by\r\nDeguer, that remains of ships, nautical instruments, and oars, have been\r\nfound in many of the Dutch mosses; and Gerard, in his History of the\r\nValley of the Somme, mentions that in the lowest tier of that moss was\r\nfound a boat loaded with bricks, proving that these mosses were at one\r\nperiod navigable lakes and arms of the sea, as were also many mosses on\r\nthe coast of Picardy, Zealand, and Friesland, from which soda and salt\r\nare procured.[1022] The canoes, stone hatchets, and stone arrow-heads\r\nfound in peat in different parts of Great Britain, lead to similar\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Imbedding of human and other remains, and works of Art, in Blown Sand._\r\n\r\nThe drifting of sand may next be considered among the causes capable of\r\npreserving organic remains and works of art on the emerged land.\r\n\r\n_African Sands._--The sands of the African deserts have been driven by\r\nthe west winds over part of the arable land of Egypt, on the western\r\nbank of the Nile, in those places where valleys open into the plain, or\r\nwhere there are gorges through the Libyan mountains. By similar\r\nsand-drifts the ruins of ancient cities have been buried between the\r\ntemple of Jupiter Ammon and Nubia. M. G. A. De Luc attempted to infer\r\nthe recent origin of our continents, from the fact that these moving\r\nsands have arrived only in modern times at the fertile plains of the\r\nNile. The same scourge, he said, would have afflicted Egypt for ages\r\nanterior to the times of history, had the continents risen above the\r\nlevel of the sea several hundred centuries before our era.[1023] But the\r\nauthor proceeded in this, as in all his other chronological\r\ncomputations, on a multitude of gratuitous assumptions. He ought, in the\r\nfirst place, to have demonstrated that the whole continent of Africa was\r\nraised above the level of the sea at one period; for unless this point\r\nwas established, the region from whence the sands began to move might\r\nhave been the last addition made to Africa, and the commencement of the\r\nsand-flood might have been long posterior to the laying dry of the\r\ngreater portion of that continent. That the different parts of Europe\r\nwere not all elevated at one time is now generally admitted. De Luc\r\nshould also have pointed out the depth of drift sand in various parts of\r\nthe great Libyan deserts, and have shown whether any valleys of large\r\ndimensions had been filled up--how long these may have arrested the\r\nprogress of the sands, and how far the flood had upon the whole advanced\r\nsince the times of history.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Sir J. G. Wilkinson is of opinion that, while the\r\nsand-drift is making aggressions at certain points upon the fertile soil\r\nof Egypt, the alluvial deposit of the Nile is advancing very generally\r\nupon the desert; and that, upon the whole, the balance is greatly in\r\nfavor of the fertilizing mud.[1024]\r\n\r\nNo mode of interment can be conceived, more favorable to the\r\nconservation of monuments for indefinite periods than that now so common\r\nin the region immediately westward of the Nile. The sand which\r\nsurrounded and filled the great temple of Ipsambul, first discovered by\r\nBurckhardt, and afterwards partially uncovered by Belzoni and Beechey,\r\nwas so fine as to resemble a fluid when put in motion. Neither the\r\nfeatures of the colossal figures, nor the color of the stucco with which\r\nsome were covered, nor the paintings on the walls, had received any\r\ninjury from being enveloped for ages in this dry impalpable dust.[1025]\r\n\r\nAt some future period, perhaps when the pyramids shall have perished,\r\nthe action of the sea, or an earthquake, may lay open to the day some of\r\nthese buried temples. Or we may suppose the desert to remain\r\nundisturbed, and changes in the surrounding sea and land to modify the\r\nclimate and the direction of the prevailing winds, so that these may\r\nthen waft away the Libyan sands as gradually as they once brought them\r\nto those regions. Thus, many a town and temple of higher antiquity than\r\nThebes or Memphis may reappear in their original antiquity, and a part\r\nof the gloom which overhangs the history of the earlier nations be\r\ndispelled.\r\n\r\nWhole caravans are said to have been overwhelmed by the Libyan sands;\r\nand Burckhardt informs us that \"after passing the Akaba near the head of\r\nthe Red Sea, the bones of dead camels are the only guides of the pilgrim\r\nthrough the wastes of sand.\"--\"We did not see,\" says Captain Lyon,\r\nspeaking of a plain near the Soudah mountains, in Northern Africa, \"the\r\nleast appearance of vegetation; but observed many skeletons of animals,\r\nwhich had died of fatigue on the desert, and occasionally the grave of\r\nsome human being. All these bodies were so dried by the heat of the sun,\r\nthat putrefaction appears not to have taken place after death. In\r\nrecently expired animals I could not perceive the slightest offensive\r\nsmell; and in those long dead, the skin with the hair on it remained\r\nunbroken and perfect, although so brittle as to break with a slight\r\nblow. The sand-winds never cause these carcases to change their places;\r\nfor, in a short time, a slight mound is formed round them, and they\r\nbecome stationary.\"[1026]\r\n\r\n_Towns overwhelmed by sand floods._--The burying of several towns and\r\nvillages in England, France, and Jutland, by blown sand, is on record;\r\nthus, for example, near St. Pol de Leon, in Brittany, a whole village\r\nwas completely buried beneath drift sand, so that nothing was seen but\r\nthe spire of the church.[1027] In Jutland marine shells adhering to\r\nsea-weed are sometimes blown by the violence of the wind to the height\r\nof 100 feet, and buried in similar hills of sand.\r\n\r\nIn Suffolk, in the year 1688, part of Downham was overwhelmed by sands\r\nwhich had broken loose about 100 years before, from a warren five miles\r\nto the south-west. This sand had, in the course of a century, travelled\r\nfive miles, and covered more than 1000 acres of land.[1028] A\r\nconsiderable tract of cultivated land on the north coast of Cornwall has\r\nbeen inundated by drift sand, forming hills several hundred feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, and composed of comminuted marine shells, in\r\nwhich some terrestrial shells are enclosed entire. By the shifting of\r\nthese sands the ruins of ancient buildings have been discovered; and in\r\nsome cases where wells have been bored to a great depth, distinct\r\nstrata, separated by a vegetable crust, are visible. In some places, as\r\nat New Quay, large masses have become sufficiently indurated to be used\r\nfor architectural purposes. The lapidification, which is still in\r\nprogress, appears to be due to oxide of iron held in solution by the\r\nwater which percolates the sand.[1029]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Imbedding of Organic and other Remains in Volcanic Formations on the\r\nLand._\r\n\r\nI have in some degree anticipated the subject of this section in former\r\nchapters, when speaking of the buried cities around Naples, and those on\r\nthe flanks of Etna (pp. 385. 400.). From the facts referred to, it\r\nappeared that the preservation of human remains and works of art is\r\nfrequently due to the descent of floods caused by the copious rains\r\nwhich accompany eruptions. These aqueous lavas, as they are called in\r\nCampania, flow with great rapidity, and in 1822 surprised and\r\nsuffocated, as was stated, seven persons in the villages of St.\r\nSebastian and Massa, on the flanks of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nIn the tuffs, moreover, or solidified mud, deposited by these aqueous\r\nlavas, impressions of leaves and of trees have been observed. Some of\r\nthose, formed after the eruption of Vesuvius in 1822, are now preserved\r\nin the museum at Naples.\r\n\r\nLava itself may become indirectly the means of preserving terrestrial\r\nremains, by overflowing beds of ashes, pumice, and ejected matter, which\r\nmay have been showered down upon animals and plants, or upon human\r\nremains. Few substances are better non-conductors of heat than volcanic\r\ndust and scoriae, so that a bed of such materials is rarely melted by a\r\nsuperimposed lava-current. After consolidation, the lava affords secure\r\nprotection to the lighter and more removable mass below, in which the\r\norganic relics may be enveloped. The Herculanean tuffs containing the\r\nrolls of papyrus, of which the characters are still legible, have, as\r\nwas before remarked, been for ages covered by lava.\r\n\r\nAnother mode by which lava may tend to the conservation of imbedded\r\nremains, at least of works of human art, is by its overflowing them when\r\nit is not intensely heated, in which case they sometimes suffer little\r\nor no injury.\r\n\r\nThus when the Etnean lava-current of 1669 covered fourteen towns and\r\nvillages, and part of the city of Catania, it did not melt down a great\r\nnumber of statues and other articles in the vaults of Catania; and at\r\nthe depth of thirty-five feet in the same current, on the site of\r\nMompiliere, one of the buried towns, the bell of a church and some\r\nstatues were found uninjured (p. 401.).\r\n\r\nWe read of several buried cities in Central India, and among others of\r\nOujein (or Oojain) which about fifty years before the Christian era was\r\nthe seat of empire, of art, and of learning; but which in the time of\r\nthe Rajah Vicramaditya, was overwhelmed, according to tradition,\r\ntogether with more than eighty other large towns in the provinces of\r\nMalwa and Bagur, \"by a shower of earth.\" The city which now bears the\r\nname is situated a mile to the southward of the ancient town. On digging\r\non the spot where the latter is supposed to have stood, to the depth of\r\nfifteen or eighteen feet, there are frequently discovered, says Mr.\r\nHunter, entire brick walls, pillars of stone, and pieces of wood of an\r\nextraordinary hardness, besides utensils of various kinds, ancient\r\ncoins, and occasionally buried wheat in a state resembling\r\ncharcoal.[1030]\r\n\r\nThe soil which covers Oujein is described as \"being of an ash-gray\r\ncolor, with minute specks of black sand.\"[1031] And the \"shower of\r\nearth,\" said to have \"fallen from heaven,\" has been attributed by some\r\ntravellers to volcanic agency. There are, however, no active volcanoes\r\nin Central India, the nearest to Oujein being Denodur hill near Bhooj,\r\nthe capital of Cutch, 300 geographical miles distant, if indeed that\r\nhill has ever poured out lava in historical times, which is doubted by\r\nmany.[1032] The latest writers on Oujein avow their suspicion that the\r\nsupposed \"catastrophe\" was nothing more than the political decline and\r\nfinal abandonment of a great city which, like Nineveh or Babylon, and\r\nmany an ancient seat of empire in the East, after losing its importance\r\nas a metropolis, became a heap of ruins. The rapidity with which the\r\nsun-dried bricks, of which even the most splendid oriental palaces are\r\noften constructed, crumble down when exposed to rain and sun, and are\r\nconverted into mounds of ordinary earth and clay, is well known.\r\nAccording to Captain Dangerfield, trap tuff and columnar basalt\r\nconstitute the rocks in the environs of Oujein[1033], and the volcanic\r\nnature of these formations, from which the materials of the bricks were\r\noriginally derived, may have led to the idea of the city having been\r\noverwhelmed by a volcanic eruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nBURYING OF FOSSILS IN ALLUVIAL DEPOSITS AND IN CAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fossils in alluvium--Effects of sudden inundations--terrestrial\r\n    animals most abundantly preserved in alluvium where earthquakes\r\n    prevail--Marine alluvium--Buried town--Effects of Landslips--Organic\r\n    remains in fissures and caves--Form and dimensions of caverns--their\r\n    probable origin--Closed basins and subterranean rivers of the\r\n    Morea--Katavothra--Formation of breccias with red cement--Human\r\n    remains imbedded in Morea--Intermixture, in caves of South of France\r\n    and elsewhere, of human remains and bones of extinct quadrupeds, no\r\n    proof of former co-existence of man with those lost species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fossils in alluvium._--The next subject for our consideration,\r\naccording to the division before proposed, is the embedding of organic\r\nbodies in alluvium.\r\n\r\nThe gravel, sand, and mud in the bed of a river does not often contain\r\nany animal or vegetable remains; for the whole mass is so continually\r\nshifting its place, and the attrition of the various parts is so great,\r\nthat even the hardest rocks contained in it are, at length, ground down\r\nto powder. But when sand and sediment are suddenly swept by a flood, and\r\nthen let fall upon the land, such an alluvium may envelop trees or the\r\nremains of animals, which, in this manner, are often permanently\r\npreserved. In the mud and sand produced by the floods in Scotland, in\r\n1829, the dead and mutilated bodies of hares, rabbits, moles, mice,\r\npartridges, and even the bodies of men, were found partially\r\nburied.[1034] But in these and similar cases one flood usually effaces\r\nthe memorials left by another, and there is rarely a sufficient depth of\r\nundisturbed transported matter, in any one spot, to preserve the organic\r\nremains for ages from destruction.\r\n\r\nWhere earthquakes prevail, and the levels of a country are changed from\r\ntime to time, the remains of animals may more easily be inhumed and\r\nprotected from disintegration. Portions of plains, loaded with alluvial\r\naccumulations by transient floods, may be gradually upraised; and, if\r\nany organic remains have been imbedded in the transported materials,\r\nthey may, after such elevation, be placed beyond the reach of the\r\nerosive power of streams. In districts where the drainage is repeatedly\r\nderanged by subterranean movements, every fissure, every hollow caused\r\nby the sinking in of land, becomes a depository of organic and inorganic\r\nsubstances, hurried along by transient floods.\r\n\r\n_Marine alluvium._--In May, 1787, a dreadful inundation of the sea was\r\ncaused at Coringa, Ingeram, and other places, on the coast of\r\nCoromandel, in the East Indies, by a hurricane blowing from the N. E.,\r\nwhich raised the waters so that they rolled inland to the distance of\r\nabout twenty miles from the shore, swept away many villages, drowned\r\nmore than 10,000 people, and left the country covered with marine mud,\r\non which the carcasses of about 100,000 head of cattle were strewed. An\r\nold tradition of the natives of a similar flood, said to have happened\r\nabout a century before, was, till this event, regarded as fabulous by\r\nthe European settlers.[1035] The same coast of Coromandel was, so late\r\nas May, 1832, the scene of another catastrophe of the same kind; and\r\nwhen the inundation subsided, several vessels were seen grounded in the\r\nfields of the low country about Coringa.\r\n\r\nMany of the storms termed hurricanes have evidently been connected with\r\nsubmarine earthquakes, as is shown by the atmospheric phenomena\r\nattendant on them, and by the sounds heard in the ground and the odors\r\nemitted. Such were the circumstances which accompanied the swell of the\r\nsea in Jamaica, in 1780, when a great wave desolated the western coast,\r\nand bursting upon Savanna la Mar, swept away the whole town in an\r\ninstant, so that not a vestige of man, beast, or habitation, was seen\r\nupon the surface.[1036]\r\n\r\n_Houses and works of art in alluvial deposits._--A very ancient\r\nsubterranean town, apparently of Hindoo origin, was discovered in India\r\nin 1833, in digging the Doab canal. Its site is north of Saharunpore,\r\nnear the town of Behat, and seventeen feet below the present surface of\r\nthe country. More than 170 coins of silver and copper have already been\r\nfound, and many articles in metal and earthenware. The overlying deposit\r\nconsisted of about five feet of river sand, with a substratum about\r\ntwelve feet thick of red alluvial clay. In the neighborhood are several\r\nrivers and torrents, which descend from the mountains charged with vast\r\nquantities of mud, sand, and shingle; and within the memory of persons\r\nnow living the modern Behat has been threatened by an inundation, which,\r\nafter retreating, left the neighboring country strewed over with a\r\nsuperficial covering of sand several feet thick. In sinking wells in the\r\nenvirons, masses of shingle and boulders have been reached resembling\r\nthose now in the river-channels of the same district, under a deposit of\r\nthirty feet of reddish loam. Captain Cautley, therefore, who directed\r\nthe excavations, supposes that the matter discharged by torrents has\r\ngradually raised the whole country skirting the base of the lower hills;\r\nand that the ancient town, having been originally built in a hollow, was\r\nsubmerged by floods, and covered over with sediment seventeen feet in\r\nthickness.[1037]\r\n\r\nWe are informed, by M. Boblaye, that in the Morea, the formation termed\r\ncaramique, consisting of pottery, tiles, and bricks, intermixed with\r\nvarious works of art, enters so largely into the alluvium and vegetable\r\nsoil upon the plains of Greece, and into hard and crystalline breccias\r\nwhich have been formed at the foot of declivities, that it constitutes\r\nan important stratum which might, in the absence of zoological\r\ncharacters, serve to mark our epoch in a most indestructible\r\nmanner.[1038]\r\n\r\n_Landslips._--The landslip, by suddenly precipitating large masses of\r\nrock and soil into a valley, overwhelms a multitude of animals, and\r\nsometimes buries permanently whole villages, with their inhabitants and\r\nlarge herds of cattle. Thus three villages, with their entire\r\npopulation, were covered, when the mountain of Piz fell in 1772, in the\r\ndistrict of Treviso, in the state of Venice,[1039] and part of Mount\r\nGrenier, south of Chambery, in Savoy, which fell down in the year 1248,\r\nburied five parishes, including the town and church of St. Andra, the\r\nruins occupying an extent of about nine square miles.[1040]\r\n\r\nThe number of lives lost by the slide of the Rossberg, in Switzerland,\r\nin 1806, was estimated at more than 800, a great number of the bodies,\r\nas well as several villages and scattered houses, being buried deep\r\nunder mud and rock. In the same country, several hundred cottages, with\r\neighteen of their inhabitants and a great number of cows, goats, and\r\nsheep, were victims to the sudden fall of a bed of stones, thirty yards\r\ndeep, which descended from the summits of the Diablerets in Vallais. In\r\nthe year 1618, a portion of Mount Conto fell, in the county of\r\nChiavenna, in Switzerland, and buried the town of Pleurs with all its\r\ninhabitants, to the number of 2430.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to multiply examples of similar local catastrophes,\r\nwhich however numerous they may have been in mountainous parts of\r\nEurope, within the historical period, have been, nevertheless, of rare\r\noccurrence when compared to events of the same kind which have taken\r\nplace in regions convulsed by earthquakes. It is then that enormous\r\nmasses of rock and earth, even in comparatively low and level countries,\r\nare detached from the sides of valleys, and cast down into the river\r\ncourses, and often so unexpectedly that they overwhelm, even in the\r\ndaytime, every living thing upon the plains.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preservation of Organic Remains in Fissures and Caves._\r\n\r\nIn the history of earthquakes it was shown that many hundreds of new\r\nfissures and chasms had opened in certain regions during the last 150\r\nyears, some of which are described as being of unfathomable depth. We\r\nalso perceive that mountain masses have been violently fractured and\r\ndislocated, during their rise above the level of the sea; and thus we\r\nmay account for the existence of many cavities in the interior of the\r\nearth by the simple agency of earthquakes; but there are some caverns,\r\nespecially in limestone rocks, which, although usually, if not always,\r\nconnected with rents, are nevertheless of such forms, and dimensions,\r\nalternately expanding into spacious chambers, and then contracting again\r\ninto narrow passages, that it is difficult to conceive that they can owe\r\ntheir origin to the mere fracturing and displacement of solid masses.\r\n\r\nIn the limestone of Kentucky, in the basin of Green River, one of the\r\ntributaries of the Ohio, a line of underground cavities has been traced\r\nin one direction for a distance of ten miles, without any termination;\r\nand one of the chambers, of which there are many, all connected by\r\nnarrow tunnels, is no less than ten acres in area and 150 feet in its\r\ngreatest height. Besides the principal series of \"antres vast,\" there\r\nare a great many lateral embranchments not yet explored.[1041]\r\n\r\nThe cavernous structure here alluded to is not altogether confined to\r\ncalcareous rocks; for it has lately been observed in micaceous and\r\nargillaceous schist in the Grecian island of Thermia (Cythnos of the\r\nancients), one of the Cyclades. Here also spacious halls, with rounded\r\nand irregular walls, are connected together by narrow passages or\r\ntunnels, and there are many lateral branches which have no outlet. A\r\ncurrent of water has evidently at some period flowed through the whole,\r\nand left a muddy deposit of bluish clay upon the floor; but the erosive\r\naction of the stream cannot be supposed to have given rise to the\r\nexcavations in the first instance. M. Virlet suggests that fissures were\r\nfirst caused by earthquakes, and that these fissures became the chimneys\r\nor vents for the disengagement of gas, generated below by volcanic heat.\r\nGases, he observes, such as the muriatic, sulphuric, fluoric, and\r\nothers, might, if raised to a high temperature, alter and decompose the\r\nrocks which they traverse. There are signs of the former action of such\r\nvapors in rents of the micaceous schist of Thermia, and thermal springs\r\nnow issue from the grottoes of that island. We may suppose that\r\nafterwards the elements of the decomposed rocks were gradually removed\r\nin a state of solution by mineral waters; a theory which, according to\r\nM. Virlet, is confirmed by the effect of heated gases which escape from\r\nrents in the isthmus of Corinth, and which have greatly altered and\r\ncorroded the hard siliceous and jaspideous rocks.[1042]\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on the quantity of carbonate of lime annually poured out\r\nby mineral waters, we are prepared to admit that large cavities must, in\r\nthe course of ages, be formed at considerable depths below the surface\r\nin calcareous rocks.[1043] These rocks, it will be remembered, are at\r\nonce more soluble, more permeable, and more fragile, than any others, at\r\nleast all the compact varieties are very easily broken by the movements\r\nof earthquakes, which would produce only flexures in argillaceous\r\nstrata. Fissures once formed in limestone are not liable, as in many\r\nother formations, to become closed up by impervious clayey matter, and\r\nhence a stream of acidulous water might for ages obtain a free and\r\nunobstructed passage.[1044]\r\n\r\n_Morea._--Nothing is more common in limestone districts than the\r\nengulfment of rivers, which after holding a subterranean course for many\r\nmiles escape again by some new outlet. As they are usually charged with\r\nfine sediment, and often with sand and pebbles where they enter, whereas\r\nthey are usually pure and limpid where they flow out again, they must\r\ndeposit much matter in empty spaces in the interior of the earth. In\r\naddition to the materials thus introduced, stalagmite, or carbonate of\r\nlime, drops from the roofs of caverns, and in this mixture the bones of\r\nanimals washed in by rivers are often entombed. In this manner we may\r\naccount for those bony breccias which we often find in caves, some of\r\nwhich are of high antiquity while others are very recent and in daily\r\nprogress. In no district are engulfed streams more conspicuous than in\r\nthe Morea, where the phenomena attending them have been lately studied\r\nand described in great detail by M. Boblaye and his fellow-laborers of\r\nthe French expedition to Greece.[1045] Their account is peculiarly\r\ninteresting to geologists, because it throws light on the red osseous\r\nbreccias containing the bones of extinct quadrupeds which are so common\r\nin almost all the countries bordering the Mediterranean. It appears that\r\nthe numerous caverns of the Morea occur in a compact limestone, of the\r\nage of the English chalk, immediately below which are arenaceous strata\r\nreferred to the period of our greensand. In the more elevated districts\r\nof that peninsula there are many deep land-locked valleys, or basins,\r\nclosed round on all sides by mountains of fissured and cavernous\r\nlimestone. The year is divided almost as distinctly as between the\r\ntropics into a rainy season, which lasts upwards of four months, and a\r\nseason of drought of nearly eight months' duration. When the torrents\r\nare swollen by the rains, they rush from surrounding heights into the\r\ninclosed basins; but, instead of giving rise to lakes, as would be the\r\ncase in most other countries, they are received into gulfs or chasms,\r\ncalled by the Greeks \"Katavothra,\" and which correspond to what are\r\ntermed \"swallow-holes\" in the north of England. The water of these\r\ntorrents is charged with pebbles and red ochreous earth, resembling\r\nprecisely the well-known cement of the osseous breccias of the\r\nMediterranean. It dissolves in acids with effervescence, and leaves a\r\nresidue of hydrated oxide of iron, granular iron, impalpable grains of\r\nsilex, and small crystals of quartz. Soil of the same description\r\nabounds everywhere on the surface of the decomposing limestone in\r\nGreece, that rock containing in it much siliceous and ferruginous\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nMany of the Katavothra being insufficient to give passage to all the\r\nwater in the rainy season, a temporary lake is formed round the mouth of\r\nthe chasm, which then becomes still farther obstructed by pebbles, sand,\r\nand red mud, thrown down from the turbid waters. The lake being thus\r\nraised, its waters generally escape through other openings, at higher\r\nlevels, around the borders of the plain, constituting the bottom of the\r\nclosed basin.\r\n\r\nIn some places, as at Kavaros and Tripolitza, where the principal\r\ndischarge is by a gulf in the middle of the plain, nothing can be seen\r\nover the opening in summer, when the lake dries up, but a deposit of red\r\nmud, cracked in all directions. But the Katavothron is more commonly\r\nsituated at the foot of the surrounding escarpment of limestone; and in\r\nthat case there is sometimes room enough to allow a person to enter, in\r\nsummer, and even to penetrate far into the interior. Within is seen a\r\nsuite of chambers, communicating with each other by narrow passages; and\r\nM. Virlet relates, that in one instance he observed, near the entrance,\r\nhuman bones imbedded in recent red mud, mingled with the remains of\r\nplants and animals of species now inhabiting the Morea. It is not\r\nwonderful, he says, that the bones of man should be met with in such\r\nreceptacles; for so murderous have been the late wars in Greece, that\r\nskeletons are often seen lying exposed on the surface of the\r\ncountry.[1046]\r\n\r\nIn summer, when no water is flowing into the Katavothron, its mouth,\r\nhalf closed up with red mud, is masked by a vigorous vegetation, which\r\nis cherished by the moisture of the place. It is then the favorite\r\nhiding-place and den of foxes and jackals; so that the same cavity\r\nserves at one season of the year for the habitation of carnivorous\r\nbeasts, and at another as the channel of an engulfed river. Near the\r\nmouth of one chasm, M. Boblaye and his companions saw the carcass of a\r\nhorse, in part devoured, the size of which seemed to have prevented the\r\njackals from dragging it in: the marks of their teeth were observed on\r\nthe bones, and it was evident that the floods of the ensuing winter\r\nwould wash in whatsoever might remain of the skeleton.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the waters of all these torrents of the Morea\r\nare turbid where they are engulfed; but when they come out again, often\r\nat the distance of many leagues, they are perfectly clear and limpid,\r\nbeing only charged occasionally with a slight quantity of calcareous\r\nsand. The points of efflux are usually near the sea-shores of the Morea,\r\nbut sometimes they are submarine; and when this is the case, the sands\r\nare seen to boil up for a considerable space, and the surface of the\r\nsea, in calm weather, swells in large convex waves. It is curious to\r\nreflect, that when this discharge fails in seasons of drought, the\r\npressure of the sea may force its salt waters into subterraneous\r\ncaverns, and carry in marine sand and shells, to be mingled with\r\nossiferous mud, and the remains of terrestrial animals.\r\n\r\nIn general, however, the efflux of water at these inferior openings is\r\nsurprisingly uniform. It seems, therefore, that the large caverns in the\r\ninterior must serve as reservoirs, and that the water escapes gradually\r\nfrom them, in consequence of the smallness of the rents and passages by\r\nwhich they communicate with the surface.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena above described are not confined to the Morea, but occur\r\nin Greece generally, and in those parts of Italy, Spain, Asia Minor, and\r\nSyria, where the formations of the Morea extend. The Copaic lake in\r\nBoeotia has no outlet, except by underground channels; and hence we\r\ncan explain those traditional and historical accounts of its having\r\ngained on the surrounding plains and overflowed towns, as such floods\r\nmust have happened whenever the outlet was partially choked up by mud,\r\ngravel, or the subsidence of rocks, caused by earthquakes. When speaking\r\nof the numerous fissures in the limestone of Greece, M. Boblaye reminds\r\nus of the famous earthquake of 469 B.C., when, as we learn from Cicero,\r\nPlutarch, Strabo, and Pliny, Sparta was laid in ruins, part of the\r\nsummit of Mount Taygetus torn off, and numerous gulfs and fissures\r\ncaused in the rocks of Laconia.\r\n\r\nDuring the great earthquake of 1693, in Sicily, several thousand people\r\nwere at once entombed in the ruins of caverns in limestone, at Sortino\r\nVecchio; and, at the same time, a large stream, which had issued for\r\nages from one of the grottoes below that town, changed suddenly its\r\nsubterranean course, and came out from the mouth of a cave lower down\r\nthe valley, where no water had previously flowed. To this new point the\r\nancient water-mills were transferred, as I learnt when I visited the\r\nspot in 1829.\r\n\r\nWhen the courses of engulfed rivers are thus liable to change, from time\r\nto time, by alterations in the levels of a country, and by the rending\r\nand shattering of mountain masses, we must suppose that the dens of wild\r\nbeasts will sometimes be inundated by subterranean floods, and their\r\ncarcasses buried under heaps of alluvium. The bones, moreover, of\r\nindividuals which have died in the recesses of caves, or of animals\r\nwhich have been carried in for prey, may be drifted along, and mixed up\r\nwith mud, sand, and fragments of rocks, so as to form osseous breccias.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 I had an opportunity of examining the celebrated caves of\r\nFranconia, and among others that of Rabenstein, newly discovered. Their\r\ngeneral form, and the nature and arrangement of their contents, appeared\r\nto me to agree perfectly with the notion of their having once served as\r\nthe channels of subterranean rivers. This mode of accounting for the\r\nintroduction of transported matter into the Franconian and other caves,\r\nfilled up as they often are even to their roofs with osseous breccia,\r\nwas long ago proposed by M. C. Prevost,[1047] and seems at length to be\r\nvery generally adopted. But I do not doubt that bears inhabited some of\r\nthe German caves, or that the cavern of Kirkdale, in Yorkshire, was once\r\nthe den of hyaenas. The abundance of bony dung, associated with hyaenas'\r\nbones, has been pointed out by Dr. Buckland, and with reason, as\r\nconfirmatory of this opinion.\r\n\r\nThe same author observed in every cave examined by him in Germany, that\r\ndeposits of mud and sand, with or without rolled pebbles and angular\r\nfragments of rock, were covered over with a _single_ crust of\r\nstalagmite.[1048] In the English caves he remarked a similar absence of\r\n_alterations_ of alluvium and stalagmite. But Dr. Schmerling has\r\ndiscovered in a cavern at Chockier, about two leagues from Liege, three\r\ndistinct beds of stalagmite, and between each of them a mass of breccia,\r\nand mud mixed with quartz pebbles, and in the three deposits the bones\r\nof extinct quadrupeds.[1049]\r\n\r\nThis exception does not invalidate the generality of the phenomenon\r\npointed out by Dr. Buckland, one cause of which may perhaps be this,\r\nthat if several floods pass at different intervals of time through a\r\nsubterranean passage, the last, if it has power to drift along fragments\r\nof rock, will also tear up any alternating stalagmitic and alluvial beds\r\nthat may have been previously formed. Another cause may be, that a\r\nparticular line of caverns will rarely be so situated, in relation to\r\nthe lowest levels of a country, as to become, at two distinct epochs,\r\nthe receptacle of engulfed rivers; and if this should happen, some of\r\nthe caves, or at least the tunnels of communication, may at the first\r\nperiod be entirely choked up with transported matter, so as not to allow\r\nthe subsequent passage of water in the same direction.\r\n\r\nAs the same chasms may remain open throughout periods of indefinite\r\nduration, the species inhabiting a country may in the meantime be\r\ngreatly changed, and thus the remains of animals belonging to very\r\ndifferent epochs may become mingled together in a common tomb. For this\r\nreason it is often difficult to separate the monuments of the human\r\nepoch from those relating to periods long antecedent, and it was not\r\nwithout great care and skill that Dr. Buckland was enabled to guard\r\nagainst such anachronisms in his investigations of several of the\r\nEnglish caves. He mentions that human skeletons were found in the cave\r\nof Wokey Hole, near Wells, in the Mendips, dispersed through reddish mud\r\nand clay, and some of them united by stalagmite into a firm osseous\r\nbreccia. \"The spot on which they lie is within reach of the highest\r\nfloods of the adjacent river, and the mud in which they are buried is\r\nevidently fluviatile.\"[1050]\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the cave of Paviland on the coast of Glamorganshire the\r\nsame author states that the entire mass through which bones were\r\ndispersed appeared to have been disturbed by ancient diggings, so that\r\nthe remains of extinct animals had become mixed with recent bones and\r\nshells. In the same cave was a human skeleton, and the remains of recent\r\ntestacea of eatable species, which may have been carried in by man.\r\n\r\nIn several caverns on the banks of the Meuse, near Liege, Dr. Schmerling\r\nhas found human bones in the same mud and breccia with those of the\r\nelephant, rhinoceros, bear, and other quadrupeds of extinct species. He\r\nhas observed none of the dung of any of these animals: and from this\r\ncircumstance, and the appearance of the mud and pebbles, he concludes\r\nthat these caverns were never inhabited by wild beasts, but washed in by\r\na current of water. As the human skulls and bones were in fragments, and\r\nno entire skeleton had been found, he does not believe that these caves\r\nwere places of sepulture, but that the human remains were washed in at\r\nthe same time as the bones of extinct quadrupeds, and that these lost\r\nspecies of mammalia co-existed on the earth with man.\r\n\r\n_Caverns in the south of France._--Similar associations in the south of\r\nFrance, of human bones and works of art, with remains of extinct\r\nquadrupeds, have induced other geologists to maintain that man was an\r\ninhabitant of that part of Europe before the rhinoceros, hyaena, tiger,\r\nand many fossil species disappeared. I may first mention the cavern of\r\nBize, in the department of Aude, where M. Marcel de Serres met with a\r\nsmall number of human bones mixed with those of extinct animals and with\r\nland shells. They occur in a calcareous stony mass, bound together by a\r\ncement of stalagmite. On examining the same caverns, M. Tournal found\r\nnot only in these calcareous beds, but also in a black mud which\r\noverlies a red osseous mud, several human teeth, together with broken\r\nangular fragments of a rude kind of pottery, and also recent marine and\r\nterrestrial shells. The teeth preserve their enamel; but the fangs are\r\nso much altered as to adhere strongly when applied to the tongue. Of the\r\nterrestrial shells thus associated with the bones and pottery, the most\r\ncommon are _Cyclostoma elegans_, _Bulimus decollatus_, _Helix\r\nnemoralis_, and _H. nitida_. Among the marine are found _Pecten\r\njacobaeus_, _Mytilus edulis_, and _Natica mille-punctata_, all of them\r\neatable kinds, and which may have been brought there for food. Bones\r\nwere found in the same mass belonging to three new species of deer, the\r\nbrown bear (_Ursus arctoideus_), and the wild bull (_Bos urus_),\r\nformerly a native of Germany.[1051]\r\n\r\nIn the same parts of France, M. de Christol has found in caverns in a\r\ntertiary limestone at Pondres and Souvignargues, two leagues north of\r\nLunel-viel, in the department of Herault, human bones and pottery\r\nconfusedly mixed with remains of the rhinoceros, bear, hyaena, and other\r\nterrestrial mammifers. They were imbedded in alluvial mud, of the\r\nsolidity of calcareous tufa, and containing some flint pebbles and\r\nfragments of the limestone of the country. Beneath this mixed\r\naccumulation, which sometimes attained a thickness of thirteen feet, is\r\nthe original floor of the cavern, about a foot thick, covered with bones\r\nand the dung of animals (_album graecum_), in a sandy and tufaceous\r\ncement.\r\n\r\nThe human bones in these caverns of Pondres and Souvignargues were\r\nfound, upon a careful analysis, to have parted with their animal matter\r\nto as great a degree as those of the hyaena which accompany them, and are\r\nequally brittle, and adhere as strongly to the tongue.\r\n\r\nIn order to compare the degree of alteration of these bones with those\r\nknown to be of high antiquity, M. Marcel de Serres and M. Ballard,\r\nchemists of Montpelier, procured some from a Gaulish sarcophagus, in the\r\nplain of Lunel, supposed to have been buried for fourteen or fifteen\r\ncenturies at least. In these the cellular tissue was empty, but they\r\nwere more solid than fresh bones. They did not adhere to the tongue in\r\nthe same manner as those of the caverns of Bize and Pondres, yet they\r\nhad lost at least three fourths of their original animal matter.\r\n\r\nThe superior solidity of the Gaulish bones to those in a fresh skeleton\r\nis a fact in perfect accordance with the observations made by Dr.\r\nMantell on bones taken from a Saxon tumulus near Lewes.\r\n\r\nM. Tessier has also described a cavern near Mialet, in the department\r\nof Gard, where the remains of the bear and other animals were mingled\r\nconfusedly with human bones, coarse pottery, teeth pierced for amulets,\r\npointed fragments of bone, bracelets of bronze, and a Roman urn. Part of\r\nthis deposit reached to the roof of the cavity, and adhered firmly to\r\nit. The author suggests that the exterior portion of the grotto may at\r\none period have been a den of bears, and that afterwards the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants of the country took possession of it either for a dwelling\r\nor a burial-place, and left there the coarse pottery, amulets, and\r\npointed pieces of bone. At a third period the Romans may have used the\r\ncavern as a place of sepulture or concealment, and to them may have\r\nbelonged the urn and bracelets of metal. If we then suppose the course\r\nof the neighboring river to be impeded by some temporary cause, a flood\r\nwould be occasioned, which, rushing into the open grotto, may have\r\nwashed all the remains into the interior caves and tunnels, heaping the\r\nwhole confusedly together.[1052]\r\n\r\nIn the controversy which has arisen on this subject, MM. Marcel de\r\nSerres, De Christol, Tournal, and others, have contended, that the\r\nphenomena of this and other caverns in the south of France prove that\r\nthe fossil rhinoceros, hyaena, bear, and several other lost species, were\r\nonce contemporaneous inhabitants of the country, together with man;\r\nwhile M. Desnoyers has supported the opposite opinion. The flint\r\nhatchets and arrow-heads, he says, and the pointed bones and coarse\r\npottery of many French and English caves, agree precisely in character\r\nwith those found in the tumuli, and under the dolmens (rude altars of\r\nunhewn stone) of the primitive inhabitants of Gaul, Britain, and\r\nGermany. The human bones, therefore, in the caves which are associated\r\nwith such fabricated objects, must belong not to antediluvian periods,\r\nbut to a people in the same stage of civilization as those who\r\nconstructed the tumuli and altars.\r\n\r\nIn the Gaulish monuments we find, together with the objects of industry\r\nabove mentioned, the bones of wild and domestic animals of species now\r\ninhabiting Europe, particularly of deer, sheep, wild-boars, dogs,\r\nhorses, and oxen. This fact has been ascertained in Quercy, and other\r\nprovinces; and it is supposed by antiquaries that the animals in\r\nquestion were placed beneath the Celtic altars in memory of sacrifices\r\noffered to the Gaulish divinity Hesus, and in the tombs to commemorate\r\nfuneral repasts, and also from a supposition prevalent among savage\r\nnations, which induces them to lay up provisions for the manes of the\r\ndead in a future life. But in none of these ancient monuments have any\r\nbones been found of the elephant, rhinoceros, hyaena, tiger, and other\r\nquadrupeds, such as are found in caves, as might certainly have been\r\nexpected had these species continued to flourish at the time that this\r\npart of Gaul was inhabited by man.[1053]\r\n\r\nWe are also reminded by M. Desnoyers of a passage in Florus, in which it\r\nis related that Caesar ordered the caves into which the Aquitanian Gauls\r\nhad retreated to be closed up.[1054] It is also on record, that so late\r\nas the eighth century, the Aquitanians defended themselves in caverns\r\nagainst King Pepin. As many of these caverns, therefore, may have served\r\nin succession as temples and habitations, as places of sepulture,\r\nconcealment, or defence, it is easy to conceive that human bones, and\r\nthose of animals, in osseous breccias of much older date, may have been\r\nswept away together, by inundations, and then buried in one promiscuous\r\nheap.\r\n\r\nIt is not on the evidence of such intermixtures that we ought readily to\r\nadmit either the high antiquity of the human race, or the recent date of\r\ncertain lost species of quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nAmong the various modes in which the bones of animals become preserved,\r\nindependently of the agency of land floods and engulfed rivers, I may\r\nmention that open fissures often serve as natural pitfalls in which\r\nherbivorous animals perish. This may happen the more readily when they\r\nare chased by beasts of prey, or when surprised while carelessly\r\nbrowsing on the shrubs which so often overgrow and conceal the edges of\r\nfissures.[1055]\r\n\r\nDuring the excavations recently made near Behat in India, the bones of\r\ntwo deer were found at the bottom of an ancient well which had been\r\nfilled up with alluvial loam. Their horns were broken to pieces, but the\r\njaw bones and other parts of the skeleton remained tolerably perfect.\r\n\"Their presence,\" says Captain Cautley, \"is easily accounted for, as a\r\ngreat number of these and other animals are constantly lost in galloping\r\nover the jungles and among the high grass by falling into deserted\r\nwells.\"[1056]\r\n\r\nAbove the village of Selside, near Ingleborough in Yorkshire, a chasm of\r\nenormous but unknown depth occurs in the scar-limestone, a member of the\r\ncarboniferous series. \"The chasm,\" says Professor Sedgwick, \"is\r\nsurrounded by grassy shelving banks, and many animals, tempted towards\r\nits brink, have fallen down and perished in it. The approach of cattle\r\nis now prevented by a strong lofty wall; but there can be no doubt that,\r\nduring the last two or three thousand years, great masses of bony\r\nbreccia must have accumulated in the lower parts of the great fissure,\r\nwhich probably descends through the whole thickness of the\r\nscar-limestone, to the depth of perhaps five or six hundred feet.\"[1057]\r\n\r\nWhen any of these natural pit-falls happen to communicate with lines of\r\nsubterranean caverns, the bones, earth, and breccia, may sink by their\r\nown weight, or be washed into the vaults below.\r\n\r\nAt the north extremity of the rock of Gibraltar are perpendicular\r\nfissures, on the ledges of which a number of hawks nestle and rear their\r\nyoung in the breeding season. They throw down from their nests the bones\r\nof small birds, mice, and other animals, on which they feed, and these\r\nare gradually united into a breccia of angular fragments of the\r\ndecomposing limestone with a cement of red earth.\r\n\r\nAt the pass of Escrinet in France, on the northern escarpment of the\r\nCoiron hills, near Aubenas, I have seen a breccia in the act of forming.\r\nSmall pieces of disintegrating limestone are transported, during heavy\r\nrains, by a streamlet, to the foot of the declivity, where land shells\r\nare very abundant. The shells and pieces of stone soon become cemented\r\ntogether by stalagmite into a compact mass, and the talus thus formed is\r\nin one place fifty feet deep, and five hundred yards wide. So firmly is\r\nthe lowest portion consolidated, that it is quarried for mill-stones.\r\n\r\n_Recent, stalagmitic limestone of Cuba._--One of the most singular\r\nexamples of the recent growth of stalagmitic limestone in caves and\r\nfissures is that described by Mr. R. C. Taylor, as observable on the\r\nnorth-east part of the island of Cuba.[1058] The country there is\r\ncomposed of a white marble, in which are numerous cavities, partially\r\nfilled with a calcareous deposit of a brick-red color. In this red\r\ndeposit are shells, or often the hollow casts of shells, chiefly\r\nreferable to eight or nine species of land snails, a few scattered bones\r\nof quadrupeds, and, what is still more singular, marine univalve shells,\r\noften at the height of many hundred, or even one thousand feet above the\r\nsea. The following explanation is given of the gradual increase of this\r\ndeposit. Land snails of the genera Helix, Cyclostoma, Pupa, and\r\nClausilia, retire into the caves, the floors of which are strewed with\r\nmyriads of their dead and unoccupied shells, at the same time that water\r\ninfiltered through the mountain throws down carbonate of lime,\r\nenveloping the shells, together with fragments of the white limestone\r\nwhich occasionally falls from the roof. Multitudes of bats resort to the\r\ncaves; and their dung, which is of a bright red color, (probably derived\r\nfrom the berries on which they feed,) imparts its red hue to the mass.\r\nSometimes also the Hutia, or great Indian rat of the island, dies and\r\nleaves its bones in the caves. \"At certain seasons the soldier-crabs\r\nresort to the sea-shore, and then return from their pilgrimage, each\r\ncarrying with them, or rather dragging, the shell of some marine\r\nunivalve for many a weary mile. They may be traced even at the distance\r\nof eight or ten miles from the shore, on the summit of mountains 1200\r\nfeet high, like the pilgrims of the olden times, each bearing his shell\r\nto denote the character and extent of his wanderings.\" By this means\r\nseveral species of marine testacea of the genera Trochus, Turbo,\r\nLittorina, and Monodonta, are conveyed into inland caverns, and enter\r\ninto the composition of the newly formed rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nIMBEDDING OF ORGANIC REMAINS IN SUBAQUEOUS DEPOSITS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Division of the subject--Imbedding of terrestrial animals and\r\n    plants--Increased specific gravity of wood sunk to great depths in\r\n    the sea--Drift-timber of the Mackenzie in Slave Lake and Polar\r\n    Sea--Floating trees in the Mississippi--in the Gulf Stream--on the\r\n    coast of Iceland, Spitzbergen, and Labrador--Submarine\r\n    forests--Example on coast of Hampshire--Mineralization of\r\n    plants--Imbedding of marine plants--of insects--of reptiles--Bones\r\n    of birds why rare--Imbedding of terrestrial quadrupeds by river\r\n    floods--Skeletons in recent shell marl--Imbedding of mammiferous\r\n    remains in marine strata.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Division of the subject._--Having treated of the imbedding of organic\r\nremains in deposits formed upon the land, I shall next consider the\r\nincluding of the same in deposits formed under water.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to divide this branch of our subject into three\r\nparts; considering, first, the various modes whereby the relics of\r\n_terrestrial_ species may be buried in subaqueous formations; secondly,\r\nthe modes whereby animals and plants inhabiting _fresh water_ may be so\r\nentombed; thirdly, how _marine_ species may become preserved in new\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena above enumerated demand a fuller share of attention than\r\nthose previously examined, since the deposits which originate upon dry\r\nland are insignificant in thickness, superficial extent, and durability,\r\nwhen contrasted with those of subaqueous origin. At the same time, the\r\nstudy of the latter is beset with greater difficulties; for we are here\r\nconcerned with the results of processes much farther removed from the\r\nsphere of ordinary observation. There is, indeed, no circumstance which\r\nso seriously impedes the acquisition of just views in our science as an\r\nhabitual disregard of the important fact, that the reproductive effects\r\nof the principal agents of change are confined to another element--to\r\nthat larger portion of the globe, from which by our very organization we\r\nare almost entirely excluded.[1059]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Imbedding of Terrestrial Plants._\r\n\r\nWhen a tree falls into a river from the undermining of the banks or from\r\nbeing washed in by a torrent or flood, it floats on the surface, not\r\nbecause the woody portion is specifically lighter than water, but\r\nbecause it is full of pores containing air. When soaked for a\r\nconsiderable time, the water makes its way into these pores, and the\r\nwood becomes _waterlogged_ and sinks. The time required for this\r\nprocess varies in different woods; but several kinds may be drifted to\r\ngreat distances, sometimes across the ocean, before they lose their\r\nbuoyancy.\r\n\r\n_Wood sunk to a great depth in the sea._--If wood be sunk to vast depths\r\nin the sea, it may be impregnated with water suddenly. Captain Scoresby\r\ninforms us, in his Account of the Arctic Regions, that on one occasion a\r\nwhale, on being harpooned, ran out all the lines in the boat, which it\r\nthen dragged under water, to the depth of several thousand feet, the men\r\nhaving just time to escape to a piece of ice. When the fish returned to\r\nthe surface \"to blow,\" it was struck a second time, and soon afterwards\r\nkilled. The moment it expired it began to sink,--an unusual\r\ncircumstance, which was found to be caused by the weight of the sunken\r\nboat, which still remained attached to it. By means of harpoons and\r\nropes the fish was prevented from sinking, until it was released from\r\nthe weight by connecting a rope to the lines of the attached boat, which\r\nwas no sooner done than the fish rose again to the surface. The sunken\r\nboat was then hauled up with great labor; for so heavy was it, that\r\nalthough before the accident it would have been buoyant when full of\r\nwater, yet it now required a boat at each end to keep it from sinking.\r\n\"When it was hoisted into the ship, the paint came off the wood in large\r\nsheets; and the planks, which were of wainscot, were as completely\r\nsoaked in every pore as if they had lain at the bottom of the sea since\r\nthe flood! A wooden apparatus that accompanied the boat in its progress\r\nthrough the deep, consisting chiefly of a piece of thick deal, about\r\nfifteen inches square, happened to fall overboard, and, though it\r\noriginally consisted of the lightest fir, sank in the water like a\r\nstone. The boat was rendered useless; even the wood of which it was\r\nbuilt, on being offered to the cook for fuel, was tried and rejected as\r\nincombustible.\"[1060]\r\n\r\nCaptain Scoresby found that, by sinking pieces of fir, elm, ash, &c., to\r\nthe depth of four thousand and sometimes six thousand feet, they became\r\nimpregnated with sea-water, and when drawn up again, after immersion for\r\nan hour, would no longer float. The effect of this impregnation was to\r\nincrease the dimensions as well as the specific gravity of the wood,\r\nevery solid inch having increased one-twentieth in size and twenty-one\r\ntwenty-fifths in weight.[1061]\r\n\r\n_Drift-wood of the Mackenzie River._--When timber is drifted down by a\r\nriver, it is often arrested by lakes; and, becoming water-logged, it may\r\nsink and be imbedded in lacustrine strata, if any be there forming;\r\nsometimes a portion floats on till it reaches the sea. In the course of\r\nthe Mackenzie River we have an example of vast accumulations of\r\nvegetable matter now in progress under both these circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn Slave Lake in particular, which vies in dimensions with some of the\r\ngreat fresh-water seas of Canada, the quantity of drift-timber brought\r\ndown annually is enormous. \"As the trees,\" says Dr. Richardson, \"retain\r\ntheir roots, which are often loaded with earth and stones, they readily\r\nsink, especially when water-soaked; and, accumulating in the eddies,\r\nform shoals, which ultimately augment into islands. A thicket of small\r\nwillows covers the new-formed island as soon as it appears above water,\r\nand their fibrous roots serve to bind the whole firmly together.\r\nSections of these islands are annually made by the river, assisted by\r\nthe frost; and it is interesting to study the diversity of appearances\r\nthey present, according to their different ages. The trunks of the trees\r\ngradually decay until they are converted into a blackish brown substance\r\nresembling peat, but which still retains more or less of the fibrous\r\nstructure of the wood; and layers of this often alternate with layers of\r\nclay and sand, the whole being penetrated, to the depth of four or five\r\nyards or more, by the long fibrous roots of the willows. A deposition of\r\nthis kind, with the aid of a little infiltration of bituminous matter,\r\nwould produce an excellent imitation of coal, with vegetable impressions\r\nof the willow-roots. What appeared most remarkable was the horizontal\r\nslaty structure that the old alluvial banks presented, or the _regular\r\ncurve_ that the strata assumed from unequal subsidence.\r\n\r\n\"It was in the rivers only that we could observe sections of these\r\ndeposits; but the same operation goes on, on a much more magnificent\r\nscale, in the lakes. A shoal of many miles in extent is formed on the\r\nsouth side of Athabasca Lake, by the drift-timber and vegetable debris\r\nbrought down by the Elk River; and the Slave Lake itself must in process\r\nof time be filled up by matters daily conveyed into it from Slave River.\r\nVast quantities of drift-timber are buried under the sand at the mouth\r\nof the river, and enormous piles of it are accumulated on the shores of\r\nevery part of the lake.\"[1062]\r\n\r\nThe banks of the Mackenzie display almost everywhere horizontal beds of\r\nwood coal, alternating with bituminous clay, gravel, sand, and friable\r\nsandstone; sections, in short, of such deposits as are now evidently\r\nforming at the bottom of the lakes which it traverses.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the vast forests intercepted by the lakes, a still\r\ngreater mass of drift-wood is found where the Mackenzie reaches the sea,\r\nin a latitude where no wood grows at present except a few stunted\r\nwillows. At the mouths of the river the alluvial matter has formed a\r\nbarrier of islands and shoals, where we may expect a great formation of\r\ncoal at some distant period.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of floating timber on the Mackenzie is owing, as Dr.\r\nRichardson informs me, to the direction and to the length of the course\r\nof this river, which runs from south to north, so that the sources of\r\nthe stream lie in much warmer latitudes than its mouths. In the country,\r\ntherefore, where the sources are situated, the frost breaks up at an\r\nearlier season, while yet the waters in the lower part of its course are\r\nice-bound. Hence the current of water, rushing down northward, reaches a\r\npoint where the thaw has not begun, and, finding the channel of the\r\nriver blocked up with ice, it overflows the banks, sweeping through\r\nforests of pines, and carrying away thousands of uprooted trees.\r\n\r\n_Drift-timber on coasts of Iceland, Spitzbergen, &c._--The ancient\r\nforests of Iceland, observes Malte-Brun, have been improvidently\r\nexhausted; but, although the Icelander can obtain no timber from the\r\nland, he is supplied with it abundantly by the ocean. An immense\r\nquantity of thick trunks of pines, firs, and other trees, are thrown\r\nupon the northern coast of the island, especially upon the North Cape\r\nand Cape Langaness, and are then carried by the waves along these two\r\npromontories to other parts of the coast, so as to afford sufficiency of\r\nwood for fuel and for constructing boats. Timber is also carried to the\r\nshores of Labrador and Greenland; and Crantz assures us that the masses\r\nof floating wood thrown by the waves upon the island of John de Mayen\r\noften equal the whole of that island in extent.[1063]\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner the bays of Spitzbergen are filled with drift-wood,\r\nwhich accumulates also upon those parts of the coast of Siberia that are\r\nexposed to the east, consisting of larch trees, pines, Siberian cedars,\r\nfirs, and Pernambuco and Campeachy woods. These trunks appear to have\r\nbeen swept away by the great rivers of Asia and America. Some of them\r\nare brought from the Gulf of Mexico by the Bahama stream; while others\r\nare hurried forward by the current which, to the north of Siberia,\r\nconstantly sets in from east to west. Some of these trees have been\r\ndeprived of their bark by friction, but are in such a state of\r\npreservation as to form excellent building timber.[1064] Parts of the\r\nbranches and almost all the roots remain fixed to the pines which have\r\nbeen drifted into the North Sea, into latitudes too cold for the growth\r\nof such timber, but the trunks are usually barked.\r\n\r\nThe leaves and lighter parts of plants are seldom carried out to sea, in\r\nany part of the globe, except during tropical hurricanes among islands,\r\nand during the agitations of the atmosphere which sometimes accompany\r\nearthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\n_Comparative number of living and fossilized species of plants._--It\r\nwill appear from these observations that, although the remains of\r\nterrestrial vegetation, borne down by aqueous causes from the land, are\r\nchiefly deposited at the bottom of lakes or at the mouths of rivers, yet\r\na considerable quantity is drifted about in all directions by currents,\r\nand may become imbedded in any _marine_ formation, or may sink down,\r\nwhen water-logged, to the bottom of unfathomable abysses, and there\r\naccumulate without intermixture with other substances.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked whether we have any data for inferring that the remains\r\nof a considerable proportion of the existing species of plants will be\r\npermanently preserved, so as to be hereafter recognizable, supposing the\r\nstrata now in progress to be at some future period upraised? To this\r\ninquiry it may be answered, that there are no reasons for expecting that\r\nmore than a small number of the plants now flourishing in the globe will\r\nbecome fossilized; since the entire habitations of a great number of\r\nthem are remote from lakes and seas, and even where they grow near to\r\nlarge bodies of water, the circumstances are quite accidental and\r\npartial which favor the imbedding and conservation of vegetable\r\nremains. Suppose, for example, that the species of plants inhabiting the\r\nhydrographical basin of the Rhine, or that region, extending from the\r\nAlps to the sea, which is watered by the Rhine and its numerous\r\ntributaries, to be about 2500 in number, exclusive of the cryptogamic\r\nclass. This estimate is by no means exaggerated; yet if a geologist\r\ncould explore the deposits which have resulted from the sediment of the\r\nRhine in the Lake of Constance, and off the coast of Holland, he could\r\nscarcely expect to obtain from the recent strata the leaves, wood, and\r\nseeds of _fifty_ species in such a state of preservation as to enable a\r\nbotanist to determine their specific characters with certainty.\r\n\r\nThose naturalists, therefore, who infer that the ancient flora of the\r\nglobe was, at certain periods, less varied than now, merely because they\r\nhave as yet discovered only a few hundred fossil species of a particular\r\nepoch, while they can enumerate more than one hundred thousand living\r\nones, are reasoning on a false basis, and their standard of comparison\r\nis not the same in the two cases.\r\n\r\n_Submarine forests on coast of Hants._--We have already seen that the\r\nsubmarine position of several forests, or the remains of trees standing\r\nin a vertical position on the British shores, has been due, in some\r\ninstances, to the subsidence of land.[1065] There are some cases which\r\nrequire a different explanation. My friend, Mr. Charles Harris,\r\ndiscovered, in 1831, evident traces of a fir-wood beneath the mean level\r\nof the sea, at Bournmouth, in Hampshire, the formation having been laid\r\nopen during a low spring tide. It is composed of peat and wood, and is\r\nsituated between the beach and a bar of sand about 200 yards off, and\r\nextends fifty yards along the shore. It also lies in the direct line of\r\nthe Bournmouth Valley, from the termination of which it is separated by\r\n200 yards of shingle and drift-sand. Down the valley flows a large\r\nbrook, traversing near its mouth a considerable tract of rough, boggy,\r\nand heathy ground, which produces a few birch-trees, and a great\r\nabundance of the _Myrica gale_. Seventy-six rings of annual growth were\r\ncounted in a transverse section of one of the buried fir-trees, which\r\nwas fourteen inches in diameter. Besides the stumps and roots of fir,\r\npieces of alder and birch are found in the peat; and it is a curious\r\nfact, that a part of many of the trees have been converted into iron\r\npyrites. The peat rests on pebbly strata, precisely similar to the sand\r\nand pebbles occurring on the adjoining heaths.\r\n\r\nAs the sea is encroaching on this shore, we may suppose that at some\r\nformer period the Bourne Valley extended farther, and that its extremity\r\nconsisted, as at present, of boggy ground, partly clothed with\r\nfir-trees. The bog rested on that bed of pebbles which we now see below\r\nthe peat; and the sea, in its progressive encroachments, eventually laid\r\nbare, at low water, the sandy foundations; upon which a stream of fresh\r\nwater, rushing through the sand at the fall of the tides, carried out\r\nloose sand with it. The superstratum of vegetable matter, being matted\r\nand bound together by the roots of trees, remained; but being\r\nundermined, sank down below the level of the sea, and then the waves\r\nwashed sand and shingle over it. In support of this hypothesis, it may\r\nbe observed, that small streams of fresh water often pass under the\r\nsands of the sea-beach, so that they may be crossed dry-shod; and the\r\nwater is seen, at the point where it issues, to carry out sand and even\r\npebbles.\r\n\r\n_Mineralization of plants_--Although the botanist and chemist have as yet\r\nbeen unable to explain fully the manner in which wood becomes petrified,\r\nit is nevertheless ascertained that, under favorable circumstances, the\r\nlapidifying process is now continually going on. A piece of wood was\r\nlately procured by Mr. Stokes, from an ancient Roman aqueduct in\r\nWestphalia, in which some portions were converted into spindle-shaped\r\nbodies, consisting of carbonate of lime, while the rest of the wood\r\nremained in a comparatively unchanged state.[1066] It appears that in\r\nsome cases the most perishable, in others the most durable, portions of\r\nplants are preserved, variations which doubtless depend on the time when\r\nthe mineral matter was supplied. If introduced immediately, on the first\r\ncommencement of decomposition, then the most destructible parts are\r\nlapidified, while the more durable do not waste away till afterwards,\r\nwhen the supply has failed, and so never become petrified. The converse\r\nof these circumstances gives rise to exactly opposite results.\r\n\r\nProfessor Goppert, of Breslau, has instituted a series of curious\r\nexperiments, in which he has succeeded in producing some very remarkable\r\nimitations of fossil petrifactions. He placed recent ferns between soft\r\nlayers of clay, dried these in the shade, and then slowly and gradually\r\nheated them, till they were red-hot. The result was the production of so\r\nperfect a counterpart of fossil plants as might have deceived an\r\nexperienced geologist. According to the different degrees of heat\r\napplied, the plants were obtained in a brown or perfectly carbonized\r\ncondition; and sometimes, but more rarely, they were in a black shining\r\nstate, adhering closely to the layer of clay. If the red heat was\r\nsustained until all the organic matter was burnt up, only an impression\r\nof the plant remained.\r\n\r\nThe same chemist steeped plants in a moderately strong solution of\r\nsulphate of iron, and left them immersed in it for several days, until\r\nthey were thoroughly soaked in the liquid. They were then dried, and\r\nkept heated until they would no longer shrink in volume, and until every\r\ntrace of organic matter had disappeared. On cooling them he found that\r\nthe oxide formed by this process had taken the form of the plants. A\r\nvariety of other experiments were made by steeping animal and vegetable\r\nsubstances in siliceous, calcareous, and metallic solutions, and all\r\ntended to prove that the mineralization of organic bodies can be carried\r\nmuch farther in a short time than had been previously supposed.[1067]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Imbedding of the Remains of Insects._\r\n\r\nI have observed the elytra and other parts of beetles in a band of\r\nfissile clay, separating two beds of recent shell-marl, in the Loch of\r\nKinnordy in Forfarshire. Amongst these, Mr. Curtis recognized _Elator\r\nlincatus_ and _Atopa cervina_, species still living in Scotland. These,\r\nas well as other remains which accompanied them, appear to belong to\r\nterrestrial, not aquatic species, and must have been carried down in\r\nmuddy water during an inundation. In the lacustrine peat of the same\r\nlocality, the elytra of beetles are not uncommon; but in the deposits of\r\ndrained lakes generally, and in the silt of our estuaries, the relics of\r\nthis class of the animal kingdom are rare. In the blue clay of very\r\nmodern origin of Lewes levels, Dr. Mantell has found the Indusia, or\r\ncases of the larvae of Phryganea, in abundance, with minute shells\r\nbelonging to the genera Planorbis, Limnea, &c., adhering to them.[1068]\r\n\r\nWhen speaking of the migrations of insects, I pointed out that an\r\nimmense number are floated into lakes and seas by rivers, or blown by\r\nwinds far from the land; but they are so buoyant that we can only\r\nsuppose them, under very peculiar circumstances, to sink to the bottom\r\nbefore they are either devoured by insectivorous animals or decomposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remains of Reptiles._\r\n\r\nAs the bodies of several crocodiles were found in the mud brought down\r\nto the sea by the river inundation which attended an earthquake in Java,\r\nin the year 1699, we may imagine that extraordinary floods of mud may\r\nstifle many individuals of the shoals of alligators and other reptiles\r\nwhich frequent lakes and the deltas of rivers in tropical climates.\r\nThousands of frogs were found leaping about among the wreck, carried\r\ninto the sea by the inundations in Morayshire, in 1829;[1069] and it is\r\nevident that whenever a sea-cliff is undermined, or land is swept by\r\nother violent causes into the sea, land reptiles may be carried in.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remains of Birds._\r\n\r\nWe might have anticipated that the imbedding of the remains of birds in\r\nnew strata would be of very rare occurrence; for their powers of flight\r\ninsure them against perishing, by numerous casualties to which\r\nquadrupeds are exposed during floods; and if they chance to be drowned,\r\nor to die when swimming on the water, it will scarcely ever happen that\r\nthey will be submerged so as to become preserved in sedimentary\r\ndeposits. In consequence of the hollow tubular structure of their bones\r\nand the quantity of their feathers, they are extremely light in\r\nproportion to their volume; so that when first killed they do not sink\r\nto the bottom like quadrupeds, but float on the surface until the\r\ncarcass either rots away or is devoured by predaceous animals. To these\r\ncauses we may ascribe the absence of any vestige of the bones of birds\r\nin the recent marl formations of Scotland; although these lakes, until\r\nthe moment when they were artificially drained, were frequented by a\r\ngreat abundance of waterfowl.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Imbedding of Terrestrial Quadrupeds._\r\n\r\nRiver inundations recur in most climates at very irregular intervals,\r\nand expend their fury on those rich alluvial plains where herds of\r\nherbivorous quadrupeds congregate together. These animals are often\r\nsurprised; and, being unable to stem the current, are hurried along\r\nuntil they are drowned, when they sink at first immediately to the\r\nbottom. Here their bodies are drifted along, together with sediment,\r\ninto lakes or seas, and may then be covered by a mass of mud, sand, and\r\npebbles, thrown down upon them. If there be no sediment superimposed,\r\nthe gases generated by putrefaction usually cause the bodies to rise\r\nagain to the surface about the ninth, or at latest the fourteenth day.\r\nThe pressure of a thin covering of mud would not be sufficient to retain\r\nthem at the bottom; for we see the putrid carcasses of dogs and cats,\r\neven in rivers, floating with considerable weights attached to them, and\r\nin sea-water they would be still more buoyant.\r\n\r\nWhere the body is so buried in drift sand, or mud accumulated upon it,\r\nas never to rise again, the skeleton may be preserved entire; but if it\r\ncomes again to the surface while in the process of putrefaction, the\r\nbones commonly fall piecemeal from the floating carcass, and may in that\r\ncase be scattered at random over the bottom of the lake, estuary, or\r\nsea; so that a jaw may afterwards be found in one place, a rib in\r\nanother, a humerus in a third--all included, perhaps, in a matrix of\r\nfine materials, where there may be evidence of slight transporting power\r\nin the current, or even of none, but simply of some chemical\r\nprecipitate.\r\n\r\nA large number of the bodies of drowned animals, if they float into the\r\nsea or a lake, especially in hot climates, are instantly devoured by\r\nsharks, alligators, and other carnivorous beasts, which may have power\r\nto digest even the bones; but during extraordinary floods, when the\r\ngreatest number of land animals are destroyed, the waters are commonly\r\nso turbid, especially at the bottom of the channel, that even aquatic\r\nspecies are compelled to escape into some retreat where there is clearer\r\nwater, lest they should be stifled. For this reason, as well as the\r\nrapidity of sedimentary deposition at such seasons, the probability of\r\ncarcasses becoming permanently imbedded is considerable.\r\n\r\n_Flood in the Solway Firth, 1794._--One of the most memorable floods of\r\nmodern date, in our island, is that which visited part of the southern\r\nborders of Scotland, on the 24th of January, 1794, and which spread\r\nparticular devastation over the country adjoining the Solway Firth.\r\n\r\nWe learn from the account of Captain Napier, that the heavy rains had\r\nswollen every stream which entered the Firth of Solway; so that the\r\ninundation not only carried away a great number of cattle and sheep, but\r\nmany of the herdsmen and shepherds, washing down their bodies into the\r\nestuary. After the storm, when the flood subsided, an extraordinary\r\nspectacle was seen on a large sand-bank called \"the beds of Esk,\" where\r\nthere is a meeting of the tidal waters, and where heavy bodies are\r\nusually left stranded after great floods. On this single bank were found\r\ncollected together the bodies of 9 black cattle, 3 horses, 1840 sheep,\r\n45 dogs, 180 hares, besides a great number of smaller animals, and,\r\nmingled with the rest, the corpses of two men and one woman.[1070]\r\n\r\n_Floods in Scotland, 1829._--In those more recent floods in Scotland, in\r\nAugust, 1829, whereby a fertile district on the east coast became a\r\nscene of dreadful desolation, a vast number of animals and plants were\r\nwashed from the land, and found scattered about after the storm, around\r\nthe mouths of the principal rivers. An eye-witness thus describes the\r\nscene which presented itself at the mouth of the Spey, in\r\nMorayshire:--\"For several miles along the beach crowds were employed in\r\nendeavoring to save the wood and other wreck with which the\r\nheavy-rolling tide was loaded; whilst the margin of the sea was strewed\r\nwith the carcasses of domestic animals, and with millions of dead hares\r\nand rabbits.\"[1071]\r\n\r\n_Savannahs of South America._--We are informed by Humboldt, that during\r\nthe periodical swellings of the large rivers in South America great\r\nnumbers of quadrupeds are annually drowned. Of the wild horses, for\r\nexample, which graze in immense troops in the savannahs, thousands are\r\nsaid to perish when the river Apure, a tributary of the Orinoco, is\r\nswollen, before they have time to reach the rising ground of the Llanos.\r\nThe mares, during the season of high water, may be seen, followed by\r\ntheir colts, swimming about and feeding on the grass, of which the top\r\nalone waves above the waters. In this state they are pursued by\r\ncrocodiles; and their thighs frequently bear the prints of the teeth of\r\nthese carnivorous reptiles. \"Such is the pliability,\" observes the\r\ncelebrated traveller, \"of the organization of the animals which man has\r\nsubjected to his sway, that horses, cows, and other species of European\r\norigin, lead, for a time, an amphibious life, surrounded by crocodiles,\r\nwater-serpents, and manatees. When the rivers return again into their\r\nbeds, they roam in the savannah, which is then spread over with a fine\r\nodoriferous grass, and enjoy, as in their native climate, the renewed\r\nvegetation of spring.\"[1072]\r\n\r\n_Floods of the Parana._--The great number of animals which are drowned\r\nin seasons of drought in the tributaries of the Plata, was before\r\nmentioned. Sir W. Parish states, that the Parana, flowing from the\r\nmountains of Brazil to the estuary of the Plata, is liable to great\r\nfloods, and during one of these, in the year 1812, vast quantities of\r\ncattle were carried away, \"and when the waters began to subside, and the\r\nislands which they had covered became again visible, the whole\r\natmosphere for a time was poisoned by the effluvia from the innumerable\r\ncarcasses of skunks, capybaras, tigers, and other wild beasts which had\r\nbeen drowned.\"[1073]\r\n\r\n_Floods of the Ganges._--We find it continually stated, by those who\r\ndescribe the Ganges and Burrampooter, that these rivers carry before\r\nthem, during the flood season, not only floats of reeds and timber, but\r\ndead bodies of men, deer, and oxen.[1074]\r\n\r\n_In Java, 1699._--I have already referred to the effects of a flood\r\nwhich attended an earthquake in Java in 1699, when the turbid waters of\r\nthe Batavian river destroyed all the fish except the carp; and when\r\ndrowned buffaloes, tigers, rhinoceroses, deer, apes, and other wild\r\nbeasts, were brought down to the sea-coast by the current, with several\r\ncrocodiles which had been stifled in the mud. (See above, p. 503.)\r\n\r\nOn the western side of the same island, in the territory of Galongoon,\r\nin the Regencies, a more recent volcanic eruption (that of 1822, before\r\ndescribed) (see above, p. 431) was attended by a flood, during which the\r\nriver Tandoi bore down hundreds of carcasses of rhinoceroses and\r\nbuffaloes, and swept away more than one hundred men and women from a\r\nmultitude assembled on its banks to celebrate a festival. Whether the\r\nbodies reached the sea, or were deposited, with drift matter, in some\r\nlarge intervening alluvial plains, we are not informed.[1075]\r\n\r\n_Sumatra._--\"On the coast of Orissa,\" says Heynes, \"I have seen tigers\r\nand whole herds of black cattle carried along by what are called\r\nfreshes, and trees of immense size.\"[1076]\r\n\r\n_In Virginia, 1771._--I might enumerate a great number of local deluges\r\nthat have swept through the fertile lands bordering on large rivers,\r\nespecially in tropical countries, but I should surpass the limits\r\nassigned to this work. I may observe, however, that the destruction of\r\nthe islands, in rivers, is often attended with great loss of lives. Thus\r\nwhen the principal river in Virginia rose, in 1771, to the height of\r\ntwenty-five feet above its ordinary level, it swept entirely away Elk\r\nIsland, on which were seven hundred head of quadrupeds,--horses, oxen,\r\nsheep, and hogs,--and nearly one hundred houses.[1077]\r\n\r\nThe reader will gather, from what was before said respecting the\r\ndeposition of sediment by aqueous causes, that the greater number of the\r\nremains of quadrupeds drifted away by rivers must be intercepted by\r\nlakes before they reach the sea, or buried in freshwater formations near\r\nthe mouths of rivers. If they are carried still farther, the\r\nprobabilities are increased of their rising to the surface in a state of\r\nputrefaction, and, in that case, of being there devoured by aquatic\r\nbeasts of prey, or of subsiding into some spots whither no sediment is\r\nconveyed, and, consequently, where every vestige of them will, in the\r\ncourse of time, disappear.\r\n\r\n_Skeletons of animals in recent shell-marl, Scotland._--In some\r\ninstances, the skeletons of quadrupeds are met with abundantly in recent\r\nshell-marls in Scotland, where we cannot suppose them to have been\r\nimbedded by the action of rivers or floods. They all belong to species\r\nwhich now inhabit, or are known to have been indigenous in Scotland. The\r\nremains of several hundred skeletons have been procured within the last\r\ncentury from five or six small lakes in Forfarshire, where shell-marl\r\nhas been worked. Those of the stag (_Cervus Elaphas_) are most numerous;\r\nand if the others be arranged in the order of their relative abundance,\r\nthey will nearly follow thus--the ox, the boar, the horse, the sheep,\r\nthe dog, the hare, the fox, the wolf, and the cat. The beaver seems\r\nextremely rare; but it has been found in the shell-marl of Loch Marlie,\r\nin Perthshire, and in the parish of Edrom, in Berwickshire.\r\n\r\nIn the greater part of these lake-deposits there are no signs of floods;\r\nand the expanse of water was originally so confined, that the smallest\r\nof the above-mentioned quadrupeds could have crossed, by swimming from\r\none shore to the other. Deer, and such species as take readily to the\r\nwater, may often have been mired in trying to land, where the bottom was\r\nsoft and quaggy, and in their efforts to escape may have plunged deeper\r\ninto the marly bottom. Some individuals, I suspect, of different\r\nspecies, have fallen in when crossing the frozen surface in winter; for\r\nnothing can be more treacherous than the ice when covered with snow, in\r\nconsequence of the springs, which are numerous, and which, retaining\r\nalways an equal temperature, cause the ice, in certain spots, to be\r\nextremely thin, while in every other part of the lake it is strong\r\nenough to bear the heaviest weights.\r\n\r\n_Mammiferous remains in marine strata._--As the bones of mammalia are\r\noften so abundantly preserved in peat, and such lakes as have just been\r\ndescribed, the encroachments of a sea upon a coast may sometimes throw\r\ndown the imbedded skeletons, so that they may be carried away by tides\r\nand currents, and entombed in submarine formations. Some of the smaller\r\nquadrupeds, also, which burrow in the ground, as well as reptiles and\r\nevery species of plant, are liable to be cast down into the waves by\r\nthis cause, which must not be overlooked, although probably of\r\ncomparatively small importance amongst the numerous agents whereby\r\nterrestrial organic remains are included in submarine strata.\r\n\r\nDuring the great earthquake of Conception in 1835, some cattle, which\r\nwere standing on the steep sides of the island of Quiriquina, were\r\nrolled by the shock into the sea, while on a low island at the head of\r\nthe Bay of Conception seventy animals were washed off by a great wave\r\nand drowned.[1078]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nIMBEDDING OF THE REMAINS OF MAN AND HIS WORKS IN SUBAQUEOUS STRATA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Drifting of human bodies to the sea by river\r\n    inundations--Destruction of bridges and houses--Loss of lives by\r\n    shipwreck--How human corpses may be preserved in recent\r\n    deposits--Number of wrecked vessels--Fossil skeletons of men--Fossil\r\n    canoes, ships, and works of art--Chemical changes which metallic\r\n    articles have undergone after long submergence--Imbedding of cities\r\n    and forests in subaqueous strata by subsidence--Earthquake of Cutch\r\n    in 1819--Buried Temples of Cashmere--Berkeley's arguments for the\r\n    recent date of the creation of man--Concluding remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to inquire in what manner the mortal remains of man\r\nand the works of his hands may be permanently preserved in subaqueous\r\nstrata. Of the many hundred million human beings which perish in the\r\ncourse of every century on the land, every vestige is usually destroyed\r\nin the course of a few thousand years; but of the smaller number that\r\nperish in the waters, a certain proportion must be entombed under\r\ncircumstances that may enable parts of them to endure throughout entire\r\ngeological epochs.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of men, together with those of the inferior animals, are\r\noccasionally washed down during river inundations into seas and lakes.\r\n(See pp. 726-728.) Belzoni witnessed a flood on the Nile in September,\r\n1818, where, although the river rose only three feet and a half above\r\nits ordinary level, several villages, with some hundreds of men, women,\r\nand children, were swept away.[1079] It was before mentioned that a rise\r\nof six feet of water in the Ganges, in 1763, was attended with a much\r\ngreater loss of lives. (See above, p. 278.)\r\n\r\nIn the year 1771, when the inundations in the north of England appear to\r\nhave equalled the floods of Morayshire in 1829, a great number of houses\r\nand their inhabitants were swept away by the rivers Tyne, Can, Wear,\r\nTees, and Greta; and no less than twenty-one bridges were destroyed in\r\nthe courses of these rivers. At the village of Bywell the flood tore the\r\ndead bodies and coffins out of the churchyard, and bore them away,\r\ntogether with many of the living inhabitants. During the same tempest an\r\nimmense number of cattle, horses, and sheep, were also transported to\r\nthe sea, while the whole coast was covered with the wreck of ships. Four\r\ncenturies before (in 1338), the same district had been visited by a\r\nsimilar continuance of heavy rains, followed by disastrous floods, and\r\nit is not improbable that these catastrophes may recur periodically,\r\nthough at uncertain intervals. As the population increases, and\r\nbuildings and bridges are multiplied, we must expect the loss of lives\r\nand property to augment.[1080]\r\n\r\n_Fossilization of human bodies in the bed of the sea._--If to the\r\nhundreds of human bodies committed to the deep in the way of ordinary\r\nburial we add those of individuals lost by shipwrecks, we shall find\r\nthat in the course of a single year, a great number of human remains are\r\nconsigned to the subaqueous regions. I shall hereafter advert to a\r\ncalculation by which it appears that more than five hundred _British_\r\nvessels alone, averaging each a burthen of about 120 tons, are wrecked,\r\nand sink to the bottom, _annually_. Of these the crews for the most part\r\nescape, although it sometimes happens that all perish. In one great\r\nnaval action several thousand individuals sometimes share a watery\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nMany of these corpses are instantly devoured by predaceous fish,\r\nsometimes before they reach the bottom; still more frequently when they\r\nrise again to the surface, and float in a state of putrefaction. Many\r\ndecompose on the floor of the ocean, where no sediment is thrown down\r\nupon them; but if they fall upon a reef where corals and shells are\r\nbecoming agglutinated into a solid rock, or subside where the delta of a\r\nriver is advancing, they may be preserved for an incalculable series of\r\nages.\r\n\r\nOften at the distance of a few hundred feet from a coral reef, where\r\nwrecks are not unfrequent, there are no soundings at the depth of many\r\nhundred fathoms. Canoes, merchant vessels, and ships of war, may have\r\nsunk and have been enveloped, in such situations, in calcareous sand and\r\nbreccia, detached by the breakers from the summit of a submarine\r\nmountain. Should a volcanic eruption happen to cover such remains with\r\nashes and sand, and a current of lava be afterwards poured over them,\r\nthe ships and human skeletons might remain uninjured beneath the\r\nsuperincumbent mass, like the houses and works of art in the\r\nsubterranean cities of Campania. Already many human remains may have\r\nbeen thus preserved beneath formations more than a thousand feet in\r\nthickness; for, in some volcanic archipelagoes, a period of thirty or\r\nforty centuries might well be supposed sufficient for such an\r\naccumulation. It was stated, that at the distance of about forty miles\r\nfrom the base of the delta of the Ganges there is an elliptical space\r\nabout fifteen miles in diameter, where soundings of from 100 to 300\r\nfathoms sometimes fail to reach the bottom. (See above, p. 279.) As\r\nduring the flood season the quantity of mud and sand poured by the great\r\nrivers into the Bay of Bengal is so great that the sea only recovers its\r\ntransparency at the distance of sixty miles from the coast, this\r\ndepression must be gradually shoaling, especially as during the\r\nmonsoons, the sea loaded with mud and sand, is beaten back in that\r\ndirection towards the delta. Now, if a ship or human body sink to the\r\nbottom in such a spot, it is by no means improbable that it may become\r\nburied under a depth of a thousand feet of sediment in the same number\r\nof years.\r\n\r\nEven on that part of the floor of the ocean to which no accession of\r\ndrift matter is carried (a part which probably constitutes, at any given\r\nperiod, by far the larger proportion of the whole submarine area), there\r\nare circumstances accompanying a wreck which favor the conservation of\r\nskeletons. For when the vessel fills suddenly with water, especially in\r\nthe night, many persons are drowned between decks and in their cabins,\r\nso that their bodies are prevented from rising again to the surface. The\r\nvessel often strikes upon an uneven bottom, and is overturned; in which\r\ncase the ballast, consisting of sand, shingle, and rock, or the cargo,\r\nfrequently composed of heavy and durable materials, may be thrown down\r\nupon the carcasses. In the case of ships of war, cannon, shot, and other\r\nwarlike stores, may press down with their weight the timbers of the\r\nvessel as they decay, and beneath these and the metallic substances the\r\nbones of man may be preserved.\r\n\r\n_Number of wrecked vessels._--When we reflect on the number of curious\r\nmonuments consigned to the bed of the ocean in the course of every naval\r\nwar from the earliest times, our conceptions are greatly raised\r\nrespecting the multiplicity of lasting memorials which man is leaving of\r\nhis labors. During our last great struggle with France, thirty-two of\r\nour ships of the line went to the bottom in the space of twenty-two\r\nyears, besides seven 50-gun ships, eighty-six frigates, and a multitude\r\nof smaller vessels. The navies of the other European powers, France,\r\nHolland, Spain, and Denmark, were almost annihilated during the same\r\nperiod, so that the aggregate of their losses must have many times\r\nexceeded that of Great Britain. In every one of these ships were\r\nbatteries of cannon constructed of iron or brass, whereof a great number\r\nhad the dates and places of their manufacture inscribed upon them in\r\nletters cast in metal. In each there were coins of copper, silver, and\r\noften many of gold, capable of serving as valuable historical monuments;\r\nin each were an infinite variety of instruments of the arts of war and\r\npeace; many formed of materials, such as glass and earthenware, capable\r\nof lasting for indefinite ages when once removed from the mechanical\r\naction of the waves, and buried under a mass of matter which may exclude\r\nthe corroding action of sea-water. The quantity, moreover, of timber\r\nwhich is conveyed from the land to the bed of the sea by the sinking of\r\nships of a large size is enormous, for it is computed that 2000 tons of\r\nwood are required for the building of one 74-gun ship; and reckoning\r\nfifty oaks of 100 years growth to the acre, it would require forty acres\r\nof oak forest to build one of these vessels.[1081]\r\n\r\nIt would be an error to imagine that the fury of war is more conducive\r\nthan the peaceful spirit of commercial enterprise to the accumulation of\r\nwrecked vessels in the bed of the sea. From an examination of Lloyd's\r\nlists, from the year 1793 to the commencement of 1829, Captain W. H.\r\nSmyth ascertained that the number of _British vessels_ alone lost during\r\nthat period amounted on an average to no less than one and a half\r\n_daily_; an extent of loss which would hardly have been anticipated,\r\nalthough we learn from Moreau's tables that the number of merchant\r\nvessels employed at one time, in the navigation of England and Scotland,\r\namounts to about twenty thousand, having one with another a mean burthen\r\nof 120 tons.[1082] My friend, Mr. J. L. Prevost, also informs me that on\r\ninspecting Lloyd's list for the years 1829, 1830, and 1831, he finds\r\nthat no less than 1953 vessels were lost in those three years, their\r\naverage tonnage being about 150 tons, or in all nearly 300,000 tons,\r\nbeing at the enormous rate of 100,000 tons annually of the merchant\r\nvessels of one nation only. This increased loss arises, I presume, from\r\nincreasing activity in commerce.\r\n\r\nOut of 551 ships of the royal navy lost to the country during the period\r\nabove mentioned, only 160 were taken or destroyed by the enemy, the rest\r\nhaving either stranded or foundered, or having been burnt by accident; a\r\nstriking proof that the dangers of our naval warfare, however great, may\r\nbe far exceeded by the storm, the shoal, the lee-shore, and all the\r\nother perils of the deep.[1083]\r\n\r\n_Durable nature of many of their contents._--Millions of silver dollars\r\nand other coins have been sometimes submerged in a single ship, and on\r\nthese, when they happen to be enveloped in a matrix capable of\r\nprotecting them from chemical changes, much information of historical\r\ninterest will remain inscribed, and endure for periods as indefinite as\r\nhave the delicate markings of zoophytes or lapidified plants in some of\r\nthe ancient secondary rocks. In almost every large ship, moreover, there\r\nare some precious stones set in seals, and other articles of use and\r\nornament composed of the hardest substances in nature, on which letters\r\nand various images are carved--engravings which they may retain when\r\nincluded in subaqueous strata, as long as a crystal preserves its\r\nnatural form.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, a splendid boast, that the deeds of the English\r\nchivalry at Agincourt made Henry's chronicle\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ----as rich with praise\r\n  As is the ooze and bottom of the deep\r\n  With sunken wreck and sumless treasuries\r\n\r\n\r\nfor it is probable that a greater number of monuments of the skill and\r\nindustry of man will, in the course of ages, be collected together in\r\nthe bed of the ocean, than will exist at any one time on the surface of\r\nthe continents.\r\n\r\nIf our species be of as recent a date as is generally supposed, it will\r\nbe vain to seek for the remains of man and the works of his hands\r\nimbedded in submarine strata, except in those regions where violent\r\nearthquakes are frequent, and the alterations of relative level so\r\ngreat, that the bed of the sea may have been converted into land within\r\nthe historical era. We need not despair, however, of the discovery of\r\nsuch monuments, when those regions which have been peopled by man from\r\nthe earliest ages, and which are at the same time the principal theatres\r\nof volcanic action, shall be examined by the joint skill of the\r\nantiquary and geologist.\r\n\r\n_Power of human remains to resist decay._--There can be no doubt that\r\nhuman remains are as capable of resisting decay as are the harder parts\r\nof the inferior animals; and I have already cited the remark of Cuvier,\r\nthat \"in ancient fields of battle the bones of men have suffered as\r\nlittle decomposition as those of horses which were buried in the same\r\ngrave.\" (See above, p. 147.) In the delta of the Ganges bones of men\r\nhave been found in digging a well at the depth of ninety feet;[1084] but\r\nas that river frequently shifts its course and fills up its ancient\r\nchannels, we are not called upon to suppose that these bodies are of\r\nextremely high antiquity, or that they were buried when that part of the\r\nsurrounding delta where they occur was first gained from the sea.\r\n\r\n_Fossil skeletons of men._--Several skeletons of men, more or less\r\nmutilated, have been found in the West Indies, on the north-west coast\r\nof the main land of Guadaloupe, in a kind of rock which is known to be\r\nforming daily, and which consists of minute fragments of shells and\r\ncorals, incrusted with a calcareous cement resembling travertin, by\r\nwhich also the different grains are bound together. The lens shows that\r\nsome of the fragments of coral composing this stone still retain the\r\nsame red color which is seen in the reefs of living coral which surround\r\nthe island. The shells belong to species of the neighboring sea\r\nintermixed with some terrestrial kinds which now live on the island, and\r\namong them is the _Bulimus Gaudaloupensis_ of Farussac. The human\r\nskeletons still retain some of their animal matter, and all their\r\nphosphate of lime. One of them, of which the head is wanting, may now be\r\nseen in the British Museum, and another in the Royal Cabinet at Paris.\r\nAccording to M. Konig, the rock in which the former is inclosed is\r\nharder under the mason's saw and chisel than statuary marble. It is\r\ndescribed as forming a kind of glacis, probably an indurated beach,\r\nwhich slants from the steep cliffs of the island to the sea, and is\r\nnearly all submerged at high tide.\r\n\r\nSimilar formations are in progress in the whole of the West Indian\r\narchipelago, and they have greatly extended the plain of Cayes in St.\r\nDomingo, where fragments of vases and other human works have been found\r\nat a depth of twenty feet. In digging wells also near Catania, in\r\nSicily, tools have been discovered in a rock somewhat similar.\r\n\r\n_Buried ships, canoes, and works of art._--When a vessel is stranded in\r\nshallow water, it usually becomes the nucleus of a sand-bank, as has\r\nbeen exemplified in several of our harbors, and this circumstance tends\r\ngreatly to its preservation. Between the years 1780 and 1790 a vessel\r\nfrom Purbeck, laden with three hundred tons of stone, struck on a shoal\r\noff the entrance of Poole harbor and foundered; the crew were saved,\r\nbut the vessel and cargo remain to this day at the bottom. Since that\r\nperiod the shoal at the entrance of the harbor has so extended itself in\r\na westerly direction towards Peveril Point in Purbeck, that the\r\nnavigable channel is thrown a mile nearer that point.[1085] The cause is\r\nobvious; the tidal current deposits the sediment with which it is\r\ncharged around any object which checks its velocity. Matter also drifted\r\nalong the bottom is arrested by any obstacle, and accumulates round it,\r\njust as the African sand-winds, before described, raise a small hillock\r\nover the carcass of every dead camel exposed on the surface of the\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nI before alluded to an ancient Dutch vessel, discovered in the deserted\r\nchannel of the river Rother in Sussex, of which the oak wood was much\r\nblackened, but its texture unchanged. (See above, p. 316.) The interior\r\nwas filled with fluviatile silt, as was also the case in regard to a\r\nvessel discovered in a former bed of the Mersey, and another disinterred\r\nwhere the St. Katherine Docks are excavated in the alluvial plain of the\r\nThames. In like manner many ships have been found preserved entire in\r\nmodern strata, formed by the silting up of estuaries along the southern\r\nshores of the Baltic, especially in Pomerania. Between Bromberg and\r\nNakel, for example, a vessel and two anchors in a very perfect state\r\nwere dug up far from the sea.[1086]\r\n\r\nSeveral vessels have been lately detected half buried in the delta of\r\nthe Indus, in the numerous deserted branches of that river, far from\r\nwhere the stream now flows. One of these found near Vikkar in Sinde, was\r\n400 tons in burthen, old fashioned, and pierced for fourteen guns, and\r\nin a region where it had been matter of dispute whether the Indus had\r\never been navigable by large vessels.[1087]\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of a river in Nova Scotia, a schooner of thirty-two tons,\r\nladen with live stock, was lying with her side to the tide, when the\r\nbore, or tidal wave, which rises there about ten feet in perpendicular\r\nheight, rushed into the estuary, and overturned the vessel, so that it\r\ninstantly disappeared. After the tide had ebbed, the schooner was so\r\ntotally buried in the sand, that the taffrel or upper rail over the\r\nstern was alone visible.[1088] We are informed by Leigh that, on\r\ndraining Martin Meer, a lake eighteen miles in circumference, in\r\nLancashire, a bed of marl was laid dry, wherein no fewer than eight\r\ncanoes were found imbedded. In figure and dimensions they were not\r\nunlike those now used in America. In a morass about nine miles distant\r\nfrom this Meer a whetstone and an axe of mixed metal were dug up.[1089]\r\nIn Ayrshire, also, three canoes were found in Loch Doon some few years\r\nago; and during the year 1831 four others, each hewn out of separate oak\r\ntrees. They were twenty-three feet in length, two and a half in depth,\r\nand nearly four feet in breadth at the stern. In the mud which filled\r\none of them was found a war-club of oak and a stone battle-axe. A canoe\r\nof oak was also found in 1820, in peat overlying the shell-marl of the\r\nLoch of Kinnordy, in Forfarshire.[1090]\r\n\r\n_Manner in which ships may be preserved in a deep sea._--It is extremely\r\npossible that the submerged woodwork of ships which have sunk where the\r\nsea is two or three miles deep has undergone greater chemical changes in\r\nan equal space of time, than in the cases above mentioned; for the\r\nexperiments of Scoresby show that wood may at certain depths be\r\nimpregnated in a single hour with salt water, so that its specific\r\ngravity is entirely altered. It may often happen that hot springs,\r\ncharged with carbonate of lime, silex, and other mineral ingredients,\r\nmay issue at great depths, in which case every pore of the vegetable\r\ntissue may be injected with the lapidifying liquid, whether calcareous\r\nor siliceous, before the smallest decay commences. The conversion, also,\r\nof wood into lignite is probably more rapid under enormous pressure. But\r\nthe change of the timber into lignite or coal would not prevent the\r\noriginal form of a ship from being distinguished; for as we find, in\r\nstrata of the carboniferous era, the bark of the hollow reed-like trees\r\nconverted into coal, and the central cavity filled with sandstone, so\r\nmight we trace the outline of a ship in coal; while in the indurated\r\nmud, sandstone, or limestone, filling the interior, we might discover\r\ninstruments of human art, ballast consisting of rocks foreign to the\r\nrest of the stratum, and other contents of the ship.\r\n\r\n_Submerged metallic substances._--Many of the metallic substances which\r\nfall into the waters probably lose, in the course of ages, the forms\r\nartificially imparted to them; but under certain circumstances these may\r\nbe preserved for indefinite periods. The cannon enclosed in a calcareous\r\nrock, drawn up from the delta of the Rhone, which is now in the museum\r\nat Montpellier, might probably have endured as long as the calcareous\r\nmatrix; but even if the metallic matter had been removed, and had\r\nentered into new combinations, still a mould of its original shape would\r\nhave been left, corresponding to those impressions of shells which we\r\nsee in rocks, from which all the carbonate of lime has been subtracted.\r\nAbout the year 1776, says Mr. King, some fishermen, sweeping for anchors\r\nin the Gulf stream (a part of the sea near the Downs), drew up a very\r\ncurious old swivel gun, nearly eight feet in length. The barrel, which\r\nwas about five feet long, was of brass; but the handle by which it was\r\ntraversed was about three feet in length, and the swivel and pivot on\r\nwhich it turned were of iron. Around these latter were formed\r\nincrustations of sand converted into a kind of stone, of exceedingly\r\nstrong texture and firmness; whereas round the barrel of the gun, except\r\nwhere it was near adjoining to the iron, there were no such\r\nincrustations, the greater part of it being clean, and in good\r\ncondition, just as if it had still continued in use. In the incrusting\r\nstone, adhering to it on the outside, were a number of shells and\r\ncorallines, \"just as they are often found in a fossil state.\" These\r\nwere all so strongly attached, that it required as much force to\r\nseparate them from the matrix \"as to break a fragment off any hard\r\nrock.\"[1091]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1745, continues the same writer, the Fox man-of-war was\r\nstranded on the coast of East Lothian, and went to pieces. About\r\nthirty-three years afterwards a violent storm laid bare a part of the\r\nwreck, and threw up near the place several masses, \"consisting of iron,\r\nropes, and balls,\" covered over with ochreous sand, concreted and\r\nhardened into a kind of stone. The substance of the rope was very little\r\naltered. The consolidated sand retained perfect impressions of parts of\r\nan iron ring, \"just as impressions of extraneous fossil bodies are found\r\nin various kinds of strata.\"[1092]\r\n\r\nAfter a storm in the year 1824, which occasioned a considerable shifting\r\nof the sands near St. Andrew's, in Scotland, a gun-barrel of ancient\r\nconstruction was found, which is conjectured to have belonged to one of\r\nthe wrecked vessels of the Spanish Armada. It is now in the museum of\r\nthe Antiquarian Society of Scotland, and is incrusted over by a thin\r\ncoating of sand, the grains of which are cemented by brown ferruginous\r\nmatter. Attached to this coating are fragments of various shells, as of\r\nthe common cardium, mya, &c.\r\n\r\nMany other examples are recorded of iron instruments taken up from the\r\nbed of the sea near the British coast, incased by a thick coating of\r\nconglomerate, consisting of pebbles and sand, cemented by oxide of iron.\r\n\r\nDr. Davy describes a bronze helmet, of the antique Grecian form, taken\r\nup in 1825, from a shallow part of the sea, between the citadel of Corfu\r\nand the village of Castrades. Both the interior and exterior of the\r\nhelmet were partially incrusted with shells, and a deposit of carbonate\r\nof lime. The surface generally, both under the incrustation, and where\r\nfreed from it, was of a variegated color, mottled with spots of green,\r\ndirty white, and red. On minute inspection with a lens, the green and\r\nred patches proved to consist of crystals of the red oxide and carbonate\r\nof copper, and the dirty white chiefly of oxide of tin.\r\n\r\nThe mineralizing process, says Dr. Davy, which has produced these new\r\ncombinations, has, in general, penetrated very little into the substance\r\nof the helmet. The incrustation and rust removed, the metal is found\r\nbright beneath; in some places considerably corroded, in others very\r\nslightly. It proves, on analysis, to be copper, alloyed with 18.5 per\r\ncent. of tin. Its color is that of our common brass, and it possesses a\r\nconsiderable degree of flexibility.\r\n\r\n\"It is a curious question,\" he adds, \"how the crystals were formed in\r\nthe helmet, and on the adhering calcareous deposit. There being no\r\nreason to suppose deposition from solution, are we not under the\r\nnecessity of inferring, that the mineralizing process depends on a small\r\nmotion and separation of the particles of the original compound? This\r\nmotion may have been due to the operation of electro-chemical powers\r\nwhich may have separated the different metals of the alloy.[1093]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effects of the Subsidence of Land, in imbedding Cities and Forests in\r\nsubaqueous Strata._\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto considered the transportation of plants and animals\r\nfrom the land by _aqueous_ agents, and their inhumation in lacustrine or\r\nsubmarine deposits, and we may now inquire what tendency the subsidence\r\nof tracts of land may have to produce analogous effects. Several\r\nexamples of the sinking down of buildings, and portions of towns near\r\nthe shore, to various depths beneath the level of the sea during\r\nsubterranean movements, were before enumerated in treating of the\r\nchanges brought about by _inorganic_ causes. The events alluded to were\r\ncomprised within a brief portion of the historical period, and confined\r\nto a small number of the regions of active volcanoes. Yet these\r\nauthentic facts, relating merely to the last century and a half, gave\r\nindications of considerable changes in the physical geography of the\r\nglobe, and we are not to suppose that these were the only spots\r\nthroughout the surrounding land and sea which suffered similar\r\ndepressions.\r\n\r\nIf, during the short period since South America has been colonized by\r\nEuropeans, we have proof of alterations of level at the three principal\r\nports on the western shores, Callao, Valparaiso, and Conception,[1094]\r\nwe cannot for a moment suspect that these cities, so distant from each\r\nother, have been selected as the peculiar points where the desolating\r\npower of the earthquake has expended its chief fury. On considering how\r\nsmall is the area occupied by the seaports of this disturbed\r\nregion--points where alone each slight change of the relative level of\r\nthe sea and land can be recognized,--and reflecting on the proofs in our\r\npossession of the local revolutions that have happened on the site of\r\neach port, within the last century and a half,--our conceptions must be\r\ngreatly exalted respecting the magnitude of the alterations which the\r\ncountry between the Andes and the sea may have undergone, even in the\r\ncourse of the last six thousand years.\r\n\r\n_Cutch earthquake._--The manner in which a large extent of surface may\r\nbe submerged, so that the terrestrial plants and animals may be imbedded\r\nin subaqueous strata, cannot be better illustrated than by the\r\nearthquake of Cutch, in 1819, before alluded to (p. 460). It is stated,\r\nthat, for some years after that earthquake, the withered tamarisks and\r\nother shrubs protruded their tops above the waves, in parts of the\r\nlagoon formed by subsidence, on the site of the village of Sindree and\r\nits environs; but, after the flood of 1826, they were seen no longer.\r\nEvery geologist will at once perceive, that forests sunk by such\r\nsubterranean movements may become imbedded in subaqueous deposits, both\r\nfluviatile and marine, and the trees may still remain erect, or\r\nsometimes the roots and part of the trunks may continue in their\r\noriginal position, while the current may have broken off, or levelled\r\nwith the ground, their upper stems and branches.\r\n\r\n_Buildings how preserved under water._--Some of the buildings which have\r\nat different times subsided beneath the level of the sea have been\r\nimmediately covered up to a certain extent with strata of volcanic\r\nmatter showered down upon them. Such was the case at Tomboro in Sumbawa,\r\nin the present century, and at the site of the Temple of Serapis, in the\r\nenvirons of Puzzuoli, probably about the 12th century. The entrance of a\r\nriver charged with sediment in the vicinity may still more frequently\r\noccasion the rapid envelopment of buildings in regularly stratified\r\nformations. But if no foreign matter be introduced, the buildings, when\r\nonce removed to a depth where the action of the waves is insensible, and\r\nwhere no great current happens to flow, may last for indefinite periods,\r\nand be as durable as the floor of the ocean itself, which may often be\r\ncomposed of the very same materials. There is no reason to doubt the\r\ntradition mentioned by the classic writers, that the submerged Grecian\r\ntowns of Bura and Helice were seen under water; and it has been already\r\nmentioned that different eye-witnesses have observed the houses of Port\r\nRoyal, at the bottom of the sea, at intervals of 88, 101, and 143 years\r\nafter the convulsion of 1692. (p. 505.)\r\n\r\n_Buried temples of Cashmere._--The celebrated valley of Cashmere (or\r\nKashmir) in India, situated at the southern foot of the Himalaya range,\r\nis about 60 miles in length, and 20 in breadth, surrounded by mountains\r\nwhich rise abruptly from the plain to the height of about 5000 feet. In\r\nthe cliffs of the river Jelam and its tributaries, which traverse this\r\nbeautiful valley, strata consisting of fine clay, sand, soft sandstone,\r\npebbles, and conglomerate are exposed to view. They contain freshwater\r\nshells, of the genera Lymneus, Paludina, and Cyrena, with land shells,\r\nall of recent species, and are precisely such deposits as would be\r\nformed if the whole valley were now converted into a great lake, and if\r\nthe numerous rivers and torrents descending from the surrounding\r\nmountains were allowed sufficient time to fill up the lake-basin with\r\nfine sediment and gravel. Fragments of pottery met with at the depth of\r\n40 and 50 feet in this lacustrine formation show that the upper part of\r\nit at least has accumulated within the human epoch.\r\n\r\nDr. Thomas Thomson, who visited Cashmere in 1848, observes that several\r\nof the lakes which still exist in the great valley, such as that near\r\nthe town of Cashmere, five miles in diameter, and some others, are\r\ndeeper than the adjoining river-channels, and may have been formed by\r\nsubsidence during the numerous earthquakes which have convulsed that\r\nregion in the course of the last 2000 years. It is also probable that\r\nthe freshwater strata seen to extend far and wide over the whole of\r\nCashmere originated not in one continuous sheet of water once occupying\r\nthe entire valley, but in many lakes of limited area, formed and filled\r\nin succession. Among other proofs of such lake-basins of moderate\r\ndimensions having once existed and having been converted into land at\r\ndifferent periods, Dr. Thomson mentions that the ruins of Avantipura,\r\nnot far from the modern village of that name, stand on an older\r\nfreshwater deposit at the base of the mountains, and terminate abruptly\r\ntowards the plain in a straight line, such as admits of no other\r\nexplanation than by supposing that the advance of the town in that\r\ndirection was arrested by a lake, now drained or represented only by a\r\nmarsh. In that neighborhood, as very generally throughout Cashmere, the\r\nrivers run in channels or alluvial flats, bounded by cliffs of\r\nlacustrine strata, horizontally stratified, and these strata form low\r\ntable-lands from 20 to 50 feet high between the different watercourses.\r\nOn a table-land of this kind near Avantipura, portions of two buried\r\ntemples are seen, which have been partially explored by Major\r\nCunningham, who, in 1847, discovered that in one of the buildings a\r\nmagnificent colonnade of seventy-four pillars is preserved underground.\r\nHe exposed to view three of the pillars in a cavity still open. All the\r\narchitectural decorations below the level of the soil are as perfect and\r\nfresh-looking as when first executed. The spacious quadrangle must have\r\nbeen silted up gradually at first, for some unsightly alterations, not\r\nin accordance with the general plan and style of architecture, were\r\ndetected, evidently of subsequent date, and such as could only have been\r\nrequired when the water and sediment had already gained a certain height\r\nin the interior of the temple.\r\n\r\nThis edifice is supposed to have been erected about the year 850 of our\r\nera, and was certainly submerged before the year 1416, when the\r\nMahomedan king, Sikandar, called Butshikan or the idol-breaker,\r\ndestroyed all the images of Hindoo temples in Cashmere. Ferishta the\r\nhistorian particularly alludes to Sikandar having demolished every\r\nCashmerian temple save one, dedicated to Mahadava, which escaped \"in\r\nconsequence of its foundations being below the neighboring water.\" The\r\nunharmed condition of the human-headed birds and other images in the\r\nburied edifice near Avantipura leaves no doubt that they escaped the\r\nfury of the iconoclast by being under water, and perhaps silted up\r\nbefore the date of his conquest.[1095]\r\n\r\n_Berkeley's arguments for the recent date of the creation of man._--I\r\ncannot conclude this chapter without recalling to the reader's mind a\r\nmemorable passage written by Bishop Berkeley a century ago, in which he\r\ninferred, on grounds which may be termed strictly geological, the recent\r\ndate of the creation of man. \"To any one,\" says he, \"who considers that\r\non digging into the earth, such quantities of shells, and in some\r\nplaces, bones and horns of animals, are found sound and entire, after\r\nhaving lain there in all probability some thousands of years; it should\r\nseem probable that guns, medals, and implements in metal or stone, might\r\nhave lasted entire, buried under ground forty or fifty thousand years,\r\nif the world had been so old. How comes it then to pass that no remains\r\nare found, no antiquities of those numerous ages preceding the Scripture\r\naccounts of time; that no fragments of buildings, no public monuments,\r\nno intaglios, cameos, statues, basso-relievos, medals, inscriptions,\r\nutensils, or artificial works of any kind, are ever discovered, which\r\nmay bear testimony to the existence of those mighty empires, those\r\nsuccessions of monarchs, heroes, and demi-gods, for so many thousand\r\nyears? Let us look forward and suppose ten or twenty thousand years to\r\ncome, during which time we will suppose that plagues, famine, wars, and\r\n_earthquakes_ shall have made great havoc in the world, is it not highly\r\nprobable that at the end of such a period, pillars, vases, and statues\r\nnow in being, of granite, or porphyry, or jasper (stones of such\r\nhardness as we know them to have lasted two thousand years above ground,\r\nwithout any considerable alteration), would bear record of these and\r\npast ages? Or that some of our current coins might then be dug up, or\r\nold walls and the foundations of buildings show themselves, as well as\r\nthe shells and stones of _the primeval world_, which are preserved down\r\nto our times.\"[1096]\r\n\r\nThat many signs of the agency of man would have lasted at least as long\r\nas \"the shells of the primeval world,\" had our race been so ancient, we\r\nmay feel as fully persuaded as Berkeley; and we may anticipate with\r\nconfidence that many edifices and implements of human workmanship and\r\nthe skeletons of men, and casts of the human form, will continue to\r\nexist when a great part of the present mountains, continents, and seas\r\nhave disappeared. Assuming the future duration of the planet to be\r\nindefinitely protracted, we can foresee no limit to the perpetuation of\r\nsome of the memorials of man, which are continually entombed in the\r\nbowels of the earth or in the bed of the ocean, unless we carry forward\r\nour views to a period sufficient to allow the various causes of change,\r\nboth igneous and aqueous, to remodel more than once the entire crust of\r\nthe earth. _One_ complete revolution will be inadequate to efface every\r\nmonument of our existence; for many works of art might enter again and\r\nagain into the formations of successive eras, and escape obliteration\r\neven though the very rocks in which they had been for ages imbedded were\r\ndestroyed, just as pebbles included in the conglomerates of one epoch\r\noften contain the organized remains of beings which flourished during a\r\nprior era.\r\n\r\nYet it is no less true, as a late distinguished philosopher has\r\ndeclared, \"that none of the works of a mortal being can be\r\neternal.\"[1097] They are in the first place wrested from the hands of\r\nman, and lost as far as regards their subserviency to his use, by the\r\ninstrumentality of those very causes which place them in situations\r\nwhere they are enabled to endure for indefinite periods. And even when\r\nthey have been included in rocky strata, when they have been made to\r\nenter as it were into the solid framework of the globe itself, they\r\nmust nevertheless eventually perish; for every year some portion of the\r\nearth's crust is shattered by earthquakes, or melted by volcanic fire,\r\nor ground to dust by the moving waters on the surface. \"The river of\r\nLethe,\" as Bacon eloquently remarks, \"runneth as well above ground as\r\nbelow.\"[1098]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nIMBEDDING OF AQUATIC SPECIES IN SUBAQUEOUS STRATA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Inhumation of fresh water plants and animals--Shell marl--Fossilized\r\n    seed-vessels and stems of chara--Recent deposits in American\r\n    lakes--Freshwater species drifted into seas and estuaries--Lewes\r\n    levels--Alternations of marine and freshwater strata, how\r\n    caused--Imbedding of marine plants and animals--Cetacea stranded on\r\n    our shores--Littoral and estuary Testacea swept into the deep\r\n    sea--Burrowing shells--Living Testacea found at considerable\r\n    depths--Blending of organic remains of different ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving treated of the imbedding of terrestrial plants and animals, and\r\nof human remains, in deposits now forming beneath the waters, I come\r\nnext to consider in what manner _aquatic_ species may be entombed in\r\nstrata formed in their own element.\r\n\r\n_Freshwater plants and animals._--The remains of species belonging to\r\nthose genera of the animal and vegetable kingdoms which are more or less\r\nexclusively confined to fresh water are for the most part preserved in\r\nthe beds of lakes or estuaries, but they are oftentimes swept down by\r\nrivers into the sea, and there intermingled with the exuviae of marine\r\nraces. The phenomena attending their inhumation in lacustrine deposits\r\nare sometimes revealed to our observation by the drainage of small\r\nlakes, such as are those in Scotland, which have been laid dry for the\r\nsake of obtaining shell marl for agricultural uses.\r\n\r\nIn these recent formations, as seen in Forfarshire, two or three beds of\r\ncalcareous marl are sometimes observed separated from each other by\r\nlayers of drift peat, sand, or fissile clay. The marl often consists\r\nalmost entirely of an aggregate of shells of the genera Limnea,\r\nPlanorbis, Valvata, and Cyclas, of species now existing in Scotland. A\r\nconsiderable proportion of the Testacea appear to have died very young,\r\nand few of the shells are of a size which indicates their having\r\nattained a state of maturity. The shells are sometimes entirely\r\ndecomposed, forming a pulverulent marl; sometimes in a state of good\r\npreservation. They are frequently intermixed with stems of Charae and\r\nother aquatic vegetables, the whole being matted together and\r\ncompressed, forming laminae often as thin as paper.\r\n\r\n_Fossilized seed-vessels and stems of Chara._--As the Chara is an\r\naquatic plant which occurs frequently fossil in formations of different\r\neras, and is often of much importance to the geologist in characterizing\r\nentire groups of strata, I shall describe the manner in which I have\r\nfound the recent species in a petrified state. They occur in a marl-lake\r\nin Forfarshire, inclosed in nodules, and sometimes in a continuous\r\nstratum of a kind of travertin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.\r\n\r\nSeed-vessel of Chara hispida.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _a_, Part of the stem with the seed-vessel attached. Magnified.\r\n\r\n  _b_, Natural size of the seed vessel.\r\n\r\n  _c_, Integument of the Gyrogonite, or petrified seed-vessel\r\n         of _Chara hispida_, found in the Scotch marl-lakes.\r\n         Magnified.\r\n\r\n  _d_, Section showing the nut within the integument.\r\n\r\n  _e_, Lower end of the integument to which the stem was attached.\r\n\r\n  _f_, Upper end of the integument to which the stigmata were attached.\r\n\r\n  _g_, One of the spiral valves of _c_.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe seed-vessel of these plants is remarkably tough and hard, and\r\nconsists of a membranous nut covered by an integument (_d_, fig. 102.)\r\nboth of which are spirally striated or ribbed. The integument is\r\ncomposed of five spiral valves, of a quadrangular form (_g_). In _Chara\r\nhispida_, which abounds in the lakes of Forfarshire, and which has\r\nbecome fossil in the Bakie Loch, each of the spiral valves of the\r\nseed-vessel turns rather more than twice round the circumference, the\r\nwhole together making between ten and eleven rings. The number of these\r\nrings differs greatly in different species, but in the same appears to\r\nbe very constant.\r\n\r\nThe stems of Charae occur fossil in the Scotch marl in great abundance.\r\nIn some species, as in _Chara hispida_, the plant when living contains\r\nso much carbonate of lime in its vegetable organization, independently\r\nof calcareous incrustation, that it effervesces strongly with acids when\r\ndry. The stems of _Chara hispida_ are longitudinally striated, with a\r\ntendency to be spiral. These striae, as appears to be the case with all\r\nCharae, turn always like the worm of a screw from right to left, while\r\nthose of the seed-vessel wind round in a contrary direction. A cross\r\nsection of the stem exhibits a curious structure, for it is composed of\r\na large tube surrounded by smaller tubes (fig. 103., _b_, _c_) as is\r\nseen in some extinct as well as recent species. In the stems of several\r\nspecies, however, there is only a single tube.[1099]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103.\r\n\r\nStem and branches of Chara hispida.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _a_, Stem and branches of the natural size.\r\n\r\n  _b_, Section of the stem magnified.\r\n\r\n  _c_, Showing the central tube surrounded by two rings of smaller tubes.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe valves of a small animal called cypris (_C. ornata?_ Lam.) occur\r\ncompletely fossilized, like the stems of Charae, in the Scotch travertin\r\nabove mentioned. The same cypris inhabits the lakes and ponds of\r\nEngland, where, together with many other species, it is not uncommon.\r\nAlthough extremely minute, they are visible to the naked eye, and may be\r\nobserved in great numbers, swimming swiftly through the waters of our\r\nstagnant pools and ditches. The antennae, at the end of which are fine\r\npencils of hair, are the principal organs for swimming, and are moved\r\nwith great rapidity. The animal resides within two small valves, not\r\nunlike those of a bivalve shell, and moults its integuments annually,\r\nwhich the conchiferous mollusks do not. The cast-off shells, resembling\r\nthin scales, and occurring in countless myriads in many ancient\r\nfreshwater marls, impart to them a divisional structure, like that so\r\nfrequently derived from plates of mica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Cypris unifasciata_, a living species, greatly\r\n  magnified.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Upper part.   _b_, Side view of the same.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105.]\r\n\r\n_Cypris vidua_, a living species, greatly magnified.[1100]]\r\n\r\nThe recent strata of lacustrine origin above alluded to are of very\r\nsmall extent, but analogous deposits on the grandest scale are forming\r\nin the great Canadian lakes, as in Lakes Superior and Huron, where beds\r\nof sand and clay are seen inclosing shells of existing species.[1101]\r\nThe Chara also plays the same part in the subaqueous vegetation of North\r\nAmerica as in Europe. I observed along the borders of several freshwater\r\nlakes in the state of New York a luxuriant crop of this plant in clear\r\nwater of moderate depth, rendering the bottom as verdant as a grassy\r\nmeadow. Here, therefore, we may expect some of the tough seed vessels to\r\nbe preserved in mud, just as we detect them fossil in the Eocene strata\r\nof Hampshire, or in the neighborhood of Paris, and many other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Imbedding of freshwater Species in Estuary and Marine Deposits._\r\n\r\n_In Lewes levels._--We have sometimes an opportunity of examining the\r\ndeposits which within the historical period have silted up some of our\r\nestuaries; and excavations made for wells and other purposes, where the\r\nsea has been finally excluded, enable us to observe the state of the\r\norganic remains in these tracts. The valley of the Ouze between Newhaven\r\nand Lewes is one of several estuaries from which the sea has retired\r\nwithin the last seven or eight centuries; and here, as appears from the\r\nresearches of Dr. Mantell, strata thirty feet and upwards in thickness\r\nhave accumulated. At the top, beneath the vegetable soil, is a bed of\r\npeat about five feet thick, inclosing many trunks of trees. Next below\r\nis a stratum of blue clay containing freshwater shells of about nine\r\nspecies, such as now inhabit the district. Intermixed with these was\r\nobserved the skeleton of a deer. Lower down, the layers of blue clay\r\ncontain, with the above-mentioned freshwater shells, several marine\r\nspecies well known on our coast. In the lowest beds, often at the depth\r\nof thirty-six feet; these marine Testacea occur without the slightest\r\nintermixture of fluviatile species, and amongst them the skull of the\r\nnarwal, or sea unicorn (_Monodon monoceros_), has been detected.\r\nUnderneath all these deposits is a bed of pipe-clay, derived from the\r\nsubjacent chalk.[1102]\r\n\r\nIf we had no historical information respecting the former existence of\r\nan inlet of the sea in this valley and of its gradual obliteration, the\r\ninspection of the section above described would show, as clearly as a\r\nwritten chronicle, the following sequence of events. First, there was a\r\nsalt-water estuary peopled for many years by species of marine Testacea\r\nidentical with those now living, and into which some of the larger\r\nCetacea occasionally entered. Secondly, the inlet grew shallower, and\r\nthe water became brackish, or alternately salt and fresh, so that the\r\nremains of freshwater and marine shells were mingled in the blue\r\nargillaceous sediment of its bottom. Thirdly, the shoaling continued\r\nuntil the river-water prevailed, so that it was no longer habitable by\r\nmarine Testacea, but fitted only for the abode of fluviatile species and\r\naquatic insects. Fourthly, a peaty swamp or morass was formed, where\r\nsome trees grew, or perhaps were drifted during floods, and where\r\nterrestrial quadrupeds were mired. Finally, the soil being flooded by\r\nthe river only at distant intervals, became a verdant meadow.\r\n\r\n_In delta of Ganges and Indus._--It was before stated, that on the\r\nsea-coast, in the delta of the Ganges, there are eight great openings,\r\neach of which has evidently, at some ancient period, served in its turn\r\nas the principal channel of discharge.[1103] As the base of the delta is\r\n200 miles in length, it must happen that, as often as the great volume\r\nof river-water is thrown into the sea by a new mouth, the sea will at\r\none point be converted from salt to fresh, and at another from fresh to\r\nsalt; for, with the exception of those parts where the principal\r\ndischarge takes place, the salt water not only washes the base of the\r\ndelta, but enters far into every creek and lagoon. It is evident, then,\r\nthat repeated alternations of beds containing freshwater shells, with\r\nothers filled with marine exuviae, may here be formed. It has also been\r\nshown by artesian borings at Calcutta (see above, p. 267), that the\r\ndelta once extended much farther than now into the gulf, and that the\r\nriver is only recovering from the sea the ground which had been lost by\r\nsubsidence at some former period. Analogous phenomena must sometimes be\r\noccasioned by such alternate elevation and depression as has occurred in\r\nmodern times in the delta of the Indus.[1104] But the subterranean\r\nmovements affect but a small number of the deltas formed at one period\r\non the globe; whereas the silting up of some of the arms of great rivers\r\nand the opening of others, and the consequent variation of the points\r\nwhere the chief volume of their waters is discharged into the sea, are\r\nphenomena common to almost every delta.\r\n\r\nThe variety of species of Testacea contained in the recent calcareous\r\nmarl of Scotland, before mentioned, is very small, but the abundance of\r\nindividuals extremely great, a circumstance very characteristic of\r\nfreshwater formations in general, as compared to marine; for in the\r\nlatter, as is seen on sea-beaches, coral-reefs, or in the bottom of the\r\nseas examined by dredging, wherever the individual shells are\r\nexceedingly numerous, there rarely fails to be a vast variety of\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Imbedding of the Remains of Marine Plants and Animals._\r\n\r\n_Marine plants._--The large banks of drift sea-weed which occur on each\r\nside of the equator in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, were\r\nbefore alluded to.[1105] These, when they subside, may often produce\r\nconsiderable beds of vegetable matter. In Holland, submarine peat is\r\nderived from Fuci, and on parts of our own coast from _Zostera marina_.\r\nIn places where Algae do not generate peat, they may nevertheless leave\r\ntraces of their form imprinted on argillaceous and calcareous mud, as\r\nthey are usually very tough in their texture.\r\n\r\nSea-weeds are often cast up in such abundance on our shores during heavy\r\ngales, that we cannot doubt that occasionally vast numbers of them are\r\nimbedded in littoral deposits now in progress. We learn from the\r\nresearches of Dr. Forchhammer, that besides supplying in common with\r\nland plants the materials of coal, the Algae must give rise to important\r\nchemical changes in the composition of strata in which they are\r\nimbedded. These plants always contain sulphuric acid, and sometimes in\r\nas large a quantity as 8-1/2 per cent., combined with potash: magnesia\r\nalso and phosphoric acid are constant ingredients. Whenever large masses\r\nof sea-weeds putrefy in contact with ferruginous clay, sulphuret of\r\niron, or iron pyrites, is formed by the union of the sulphur of the\r\nplants with the iron of the clay; while the potash, released from its\r\nunion with the clay (_i. e._ silicate of alumina), forms with it a\r\npeculiar compound. Many of the mineral characteristics of ancient rocks,\r\nespecially the alum slates, and the pyrites which occur in clay slate,\r\nand the fragments of anthracite in marine Silurian strata, may be\r\nexplained by the decomposition of fucoids or sea-weeds.[1106]\r\n\r\n_Imbedding of cetacea._--It is not uncommon for the larger Cetacea,\r\nwhich can float only in a considerable depth of water, to be carried\r\nduring storms or high tides into estuaries, or upon low shores, where,\r\nupon the retiring of high water, they are stranded. Thus a narwal\r\n(_Monodon monoceros_) was found on the beach, near Boston in\r\nLincolnshire, in the year 1800, the whole of its body buried in the mud.\r\nA fisherman going to his boat saw the horn, and tried to pull it out,\r\nwhen the animal began to stir itself.[1107] An individual of the common\r\nwhale (_Balaena mysticetus_), which measured seventy feet,\r\ncame ashore near Peterhead, in 1682. Many individuals of the genus\r\nBalaenoptera have met the same fate. It will be sufficient to refer to\r\nthose cast on shore near Burnt Island, and at Alloa, recorded by Sibbald\r\nand Neill. The other individual mentioned by Sibbald, as having come\r\nashore at Boyne, in Banffshire, was probably a razor-back. Of the genus\r\nCatodon (_Cachalot_), Ray mentions a large one stranded on the west\r\ncoast of Holland in 1598, and the fact is also commemorated in a Dutch\r\nengraving of the time of much merit. Sibbald, too, records that a herd\r\nof Cachalots, upwards of 100 in number, were found stranded at\r\nCairston, in Orkney. The dead bodies of the larger Cetacea are sometimes\r\nfound floating on the surface of the waters, as was the case with the\r\nimmense whale exhibited in London in 1831. And the carcase of a sea-cow\r\nor Lamantine (_Halicora_) was, in 1785, cast ashore near Leith.\r\n\r\nTo some accident of this kind we may refer the position of the skeleton\r\nof a whale, seventy-three feet long, which was found at Airthrey, on the\r\nForth, near Stirling, imbedded in clay twenty feet higher than the\r\nsurface of the highest tide of the river Forth at the present day. From\r\nthe situation of the Roman station and causeways at a small distance\r\nfrom the spot, it is concluded that the whale must have been stranded\r\nthere at a period prior to the Christian era.[1108]\r\n\r\nOther fossil remains of this class have also been found in estuaries\r\nknown to have been silted up in recent times, one example of which has\r\nbeen already mentioned near Lewes, in Sussex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106.\r\n\r\nFossil eggs of turtles from the Island of Ascension.[1109]]\r\n\r\n_Marine reptiles._--Some singular fossils have lately been discovered in\r\nthe Island of Ascension, in a stone said to be continually forming on\r\nthe beach, where the waves threw up small rounded fragments of shells\r\nand corals, which, in the course of time, become firmly agglutinated\r\ntogether, and constitute a stone used largely for building and making\r\nlime. In a quarry on the N. W. side of the island, about 100 yards from\r\nthe sea, some fossil eggs of turtles have been discovered in the hard\r\nrock thus formed. The eggs must have been nearly hatched at the time\r\nwhen they perished; for the bones of the young turtle are seen in the\r\ninterior, with their shape fully developed, the interstices between the\r\nbones being entirely filled with grains of sand, which are cemented\r\ntogether, so that when the egg-shells are removed perfect casts of their\r\nform remain in stone. In the single specimen here figured (fig. 106),\r\nwhich is only five inches in its longest diameter, no less than seven\r\neggs are preserved.[1110]\r\n\r\nTo explain the state in which they occur fossil, it seems necessary to\r\nsuppose that after the eggs were almost hatched in the warm sand, a\r\ngreat wave threw upon them so much more sand as to prevent the rays of\r\nthe sun from penetrating, so that the yolk was chilled and deprived of\r\nvitality. The shells were, perhaps, slightly broken at the same time,\r\nso that small grains of sand might gradually be introduced into the\r\ninterior by water as it percolated through the beach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107.\r\n\r\nOne of the eggs in fig. 106, of the natural size, showing the bones of\r\nthe foetus which had been nearly hatched.]\r\n\r\n_Marine testacea._--The aquatic animals and plants which inhabit an\r\nestuary are liable, like the trees and land animals which people the\r\nalluvial plains of a great river, to be swept from time to time far into\r\nthe deep; for as a river is perpetually shifting its course, and\r\nundermining a portion of its banks with the forests which cover them, so\r\nthe marine current alters its direction from time to time, and bears\r\naway the banks of sand and mud against which it turns its force. These\r\nbanks may consist in great measure of shells peculiar to shallow and\r\nsometimes brackish water, which may have been accumulating for\r\ncenturies, until at length they are carried away and spread out along\r\nthe bottom of the sea, at a depth at which they could not have lived and\r\nmultiplied. Thus littoral and estuary shells are more frequently liable\r\neven than freshwater species, to be intermixed with the exuviae of\r\npelagic tribes.\r\n\r\nAfter the storm of February 4, 1831, when several vessels were wrecked\r\nin the estuary of the Forth, the current was directed against a bed of\r\noysters with such force, that great heaps of them were thrown _alive_\r\nupon the beach, and remained above high-water mark. I collected many of\r\nthese oysters, as also the common eatable whelks (_Buccina_), thrown up\r\nwith them, and observed that, although still living, their shells were\r\nworn by the long attrition of sand which had passed over them as they\r\nlay in their native bed, and which had evidently not resulted from the\r\nmere action of the tempest by which they were cast ashore.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts we learn that the union of the two parts of a bivalve\r\nshell does not prove that it has not been transported to a distance;\r\nand when we find shells worn, and with all their prominent parts rubbed\r\noff, they may still have been imbedded where they grew.\r\n\r\n_Burrowing shells._--It sometimes appears extraordinary, when we observe\r\nthe violence of the breakers on our coast, and see the strength of the\r\ncurrent in removing cliffs, and sweeping out new channels, that many\r\ntender and fragile shells should inhabit the sea in the immediate\r\nvicinity of this turmoil. But a great number of the bivalve Testacea,\r\nand many also of the turbinated univalves, burrow in sand or mud. The\r\nSolen and the Cardium, for example, which are usually found in shallow\r\nwater near the shore, pierce through a soft bottom without injury to\r\ntheir shells; and the Pholas can drill a cavity through mud of\r\nconsiderable hardness. The species of these and many other tribes can\r\nsink, when alarmed, with considerable rapidity, often to the depth of\r\nseveral feet, and can also penetrate upwards again to the surface, if a\r\nmass of matter be heaped upon them. The hurricane, therefore, may expend\r\nits fury in vain, and may sweep away even the upper part of banks of\r\nsand or mud, or may roll pebbles over them, and yet these Testacea may\r\nremain below secure and uninjured.\r\n\r\n_Shells become fossil at considerable depths._--I have already stated\r\nthat, at the depth of 950 fathoms, between Gibraltar and Ceuta, Captain\r\nSmith found a gravelly bottom, with fragments of broken shells, carried\r\nthither probably from the comparatively shallow parts of the neighboring\r\nstraits, through which a powerful current flows. Beds of shelly sand\r\nmight here, in the course of ages, be accumulated several thousand feet\r\nthick. But, without the aid of the drifting power of a current, shells\r\nmay accumulate in the spot where they live and die, at great depths from\r\nthe surface, if sediment be thrown down upon them; for even in our own\r\ncolder latitudes, the depths at which living marine animals abound is\r\nvery considerable. Captain Vidal ascertained, by soundings made off Tory\r\nIsland, on the northwest coast of Ireland, that Crustacea, Star-fish,\r\nand Testacea occurred at various depths between fifty and one hundred\r\nfathoms; and he drew up Dentalia from the mud of Galway Bay, in 230 and\r\n240 _fathoms_ water.\r\n\r\nThe same hydrographer discovered on the Rockhall Bank large quantities\r\nof shells at depths varying from 45 to 190 fathoms. The shells were for\r\nthe most part pulverized, and evidently recent, as they retained their\r\ncolors. In the same region a bed of fish bones was observed extending\r\nfor two miles along the bottom of the sea in eighty and ninety fathoms\r\nwater. At the eastern extremity also of Rockhall Bank, fishbones were\r\nmet with, mingled with pieces of fresh shell, at the depth of 235\r\nfathoms.\r\n\r\nAnalogous formations are in progress in the submarine tracts extending\r\nfrom the Shetland Isles to the north of Ireland, wherever soundings can\r\nbe procured. A continuous deposit of sand and mud, replete with broken\r\nand entire shells, Echini, &c., has been traced for upwards of twenty\r\nmiles to the eastward of the Faroe Islands, usually at the depth of from\r\nforty to one hundred fathoms. In one part of this tract (lat. 61 degrees\r\n50 minutes, long. 6 degrees 30 minutes) fish-bones occur in\r\nextraordinary profusion, so that the lead cannot be drawn up without\r\nsome vertebrae being attached. This \"bone bed,\" as it was called by our\r\nsurveyors, is three miles and a half in length, and forty-five fathoms\r\nunder water, and contains a few shells intermingled with the bones.\r\n\r\nIn the British seas, the shells and other organic remains lie in soft\r\nmud or loose sand and gravel; whereas, in the bed of the Adriatic,\r\nDonati found them frequently inclosed in stone of recent origin. This is\r\nprecisely the difference in character which we might have expected to\r\nexist between the British marine formations now in progress and those of\r\nthe Adriatic; for calcareous and other mineral springs abound in the\r\nMediterranean and lands adjoining, while they are almost entirely\r\nwanting in our own country. I have already adverted to the eight regions\r\nof different depths in the AEgean Sea, each characterized by a peculiar\r\nassemblage of shells, which have been described by Professor E. Forbes,\r\nwho explored them by dredging. (See above, p. 649.)\r\n\r\nDuring his survey of the west coast of Africa, Captain Sir E. Belcher\r\nfound, by frequent soundings between the twenty-third and twentieth\r\ndegrees of north latitude, that the bottom of the sea, at the depth of\r\nfrom twenty to about fifty fathoms, consists of sand with a great\r\nintermixture of shells, often entire, but sometimes finely comminuted.\r\nBetween the eleventh and ninth degrees of north latitude, on the same\r\ncoast, at soundings varying from twenty to about eighty fathoms, he\r\nbrought up abundance of corals and shells mixed with sand. These also\r\nwere in some parts entire, and in others worn and broken.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases, it is only necessary that there should be some\r\ndeposition of sedimentary matter, however minute, such as may be\r\nsupplied by rivers draining a continent, or currents preying on a line\r\nof cliffs, in order that stratified formations, hundreds of feet in\r\nthickness, and replete with organic remains, should result in the course\r\nof ages.\r\n\r\nBut although some deposits may thus extend continuously for a thousand\r\nmiles or more near certain coasts, the greater part of the bed of the\r\nocean, remote from continents and islands, may very probably receive, at\r\nthe same time, no new accessions of drift matter, all sediment being\r\nintercepted by intervening hollows, in which a marine current must clear\r\nits waters as thoroughly as a turbid river in a lake. Erroneous theories\r\nin geology may be formed not only from overlooking the great extent of\r\nsimultaneous deposits now in progress, but also from the assumption that\r\nsuch formations may be universal or coextensive with the bed of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nWe frequently observe, on the sea beach, very perfect specimens of\r\nfossil shells, quite detached from their matrix, which have been washed\r\nout of older formations, constituting the sea-cliffs. They may be all of\r\nextinct species, like the Eocene freshwater and marine shells strewed\r\nover the shores of Hampshire, yet when they become mingled with the\r\nshells of the present period, and buried in the same deposits of mud and\r\nsand, they would appear, if upraised and examined by future geologists,\r\nto have been all of the same age. That such intermixture and blending\r\nof organic remains of different ages have actually taken place in former\r\ntimes, is unquestionable, though the occurrence appears to be very local\r\nand exceptional. It is, however, a class of accidents more likely than\r\nalmost any other to lead to serious anachronisms in geological\r\nchronology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF CORAL REEFS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Growth of coral chiefly confined to tropical regions--Principal\r\n    genera of coral-building zoophytes--Their rate of growth--Seldom\r\n    flourish at greater depths than twenty fathoms--Atolls or annular\r\n    reefs with lagoons--Maldive Isles--Origin of the circular\r\n    form--Coral reefs not based on submerged volcanic craters--Mr.\r\n    Darwin's theory of subsidence in explanation of atolls, encircling\r\n    and barrier reefs--Why the windward side of atolls\r\n    highest--Subsidence explains why all atolls are nearly on one\r\n    level--Alternate areas of elevation and subsidence--Origin of\r\n    openings into the lagoons--Size of atolls and barrier\r\n    reefs--Objection to the theory of subsidence\r\n    considered--Composition, structure, and stratified arrangement of\r\n    rocks now forming in coral reefs--Lime, whence derived--Supposed\r\n    increase of calcareous matter in modern epochs\r\n    controverted--Concluding remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe powers of the organic creation in modifying the form and structure\r\nof the earth's crust, are most conspicuously displayed in the labors of\r\nthe coral animals. We may compare the operation of these zoophytes in\r\nthe ocean, to the effects produced on a smaller scale upon the land by\r\nthe plants which generate peat. In the case of the Sphagnum, the upper\r\npart vegetates while the lower part is entering into a mineral mass, in\r\nwhich the traces of organization remain when life has entirely ceased.\r\nIn corals, in like manner, the more durable materials of the generation\r\nthat has passed away serve as the foundation on which the living animals\r\ncontinue to rear a similar structure.\r\n\r\nThe stony part of the lamelliform zoophyte may be likened to an internal\r\nskeleton; for it is always more or less surrounded by a soft animal\r\nsubstance capable of expanding itself; yet, when alarmed, it has the\r\npower of contracting and drawing itself almost entirely into the cells\r\nand hollows of the hard coral. Although oftentimes beautifully colored\r\nin their own element, the soft parts become when taken from the sea\r\nnothing more in appearance than a brown slime spread over the stony\r\nnucleus.[1111]\r\n\r\nThe growth of those corals which form reefs of solid stone is entirely\r\nconfined to the warmer regions of the globe, rarely extending beyond the\r\ntropics above two or three degrees, except under peculiar circumstances,\r\nas in the Bermuda Islands, in lat. 32 degrees N., where the Atlantic is\r\nwarmed by the Gulf stream. The Pacific Ocean, throughout a space\r\ncomprehended between the thirtieth parallels of latitude on each side of\r\nthe equator, is extremely productive of coral; as also are the Arabian\r\nand Persian Gulfs. Coral is also abundant in the sea between the coast\r\nof Malabar and the island of Madagascar. Flinders describes a reef of\r\ncoral on the east coast of New Holland as having a length of nearly 1000\r\nmiles, and as being in one part unbroken for a distance of 350 miles.\r\nSome groups of coral islands in the Pacific are from 1100 to 1200 miles\r\nin length, by 300 or 400 in breadth, as the Dangerous Archipelago, for\r\nexample, and that called Radack by Kotzebue; but the islands within\r\nthese spaces are always small points, and often very thinly sown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108.\r\n\r\n_Meandrina labyrinthica_, Lam.]\r\n\r\nOf the numerous species of zoophytes which are engaged in the production\r\nof coral banks, some of the most common belong to the Lamarckian genera\r\nAstrea, Porites, Madrepora, Millepora, Caryophyllia, and Meandrina.\r\n\r\n_Rate of the growth of Coral._--Very different opinions have been\r\nentertained in regard to the rate at which coral reefs increase. In\r\nCaptain Beechey's late expedition to the Pacific, no positive\r\ninformation could be obtained of any channel having been filled up\r\nwithin a given period; and it seems established, that several reefs had\r\nremained for more than half a century, at about the same depth from the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nEhrenberg also questions the fact of channels and harbors having been\r\nclosed up in the Red Sea by the rapid increase of coral limestone. He\r\nsupposes the notion to have arisen from the circumstance of havens\r\nhaving been occasionally filled up in some places with coral sand, in\r\nothers with large quantities of ballast of coral rock thrown down from\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Genera of Zoophytes most common in coral reefs.\r\n\r\nFig. 109.\r\n\r\n_Astrea dipsacea_, Lam.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110.\r\n\r\nExtremity of branch of _Madrepora muricata_, Lin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111.\r\n\r\n_Caryophyllia fastigiata_, Lam.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112.\r\n\r\n_Porites clavaria_, Lam.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113.\r\n\r\n_Oculina hirtella_, Lam.]\r\n\r\nThe natives of the Bermuda Islands point out certain corals now growing\r\nin the sea, which, according to tradition, have been living in the same\r\nspots for centuries. It is supposed that some of them may vie in age\r\nwith the most ancient trees of Europe. Ehrenberg also observed single\r\ncorals of the genera Meandrina and Favia, having a globular form, from\r\nsix to nine feet in diameter, \"which must (he says) be of immense\r\nantiquity, probably several thousand years old, so that Pharaoh may have\r\nlooked upon these same individuals in the Red Sea.\"[1112] They certainly\r\nimply, as he remarks, that the reef on which they grow has increased at\r\na very slow rate. After collecting more than 100 species, he found none\r\nof them covered with parasitic zoophytes, nor any instance of a living\r\ncoral growing on another living coral. To this repulsive power which\r\nthey exert whilst living, against all others of their own class, we owe\r\nthe beautiful symmetry of some large Meandrinae, and other species which\r\nadorn our museums. Yet Balani and Serpulae can attach themselves to\r\nliving corals, and holes are excavated in them by saxicavous mollusca.\r\n\r\nAt the island called Taaopoto, in the South Pacific, the anchor of a\r\nship, wrecked about 50 years before, was observed in seven fathoms\r\nwater, still preserving its original form, but entirely incrusted by\r\ncoral.[1113] This fact would seem to imply a slow rate of augmentation;\r\nbut to form a correct estimate of the average rate must be very\r\ndifficult, since it must vary not only according to the species of\r\ncoral, but according to the circumstances under which each species may\r\nbe placed; such, for example, as the depth from the surface, the\r\nquantity of light, the temperature of the water, its freedom from sand\r\nor mud, or the absence or presence of breakers, which is favorable to\r\nthe growth of some kinds and is fatal to that of others. It should also\r\nbe observed that the apparent stationary condition of some coral reefs,\r\nwhich according to Beechey have remained for centuries at the same depth\r\nunder water, may be due to subsidence, the upward growth of the coral\r\nhaving been just sufficient to keep pace with the sinking of the solid\r\nfoundation on which the zoophytes have built. We shall afterwards see\r\nhow far this hypothesis is borne out by other evidence in the regions of\r\nannular reefs or atolls.\r\n\r\nIn one of the Maldive islands a coral reef, which, within a few years,\r\nexisted on an islet bearing cocoa-nut trees, was found by Lieutenant\r\nPrentice, \"_entirely covered with live coral and madrepore_.\" The\r\nnatives stated that the islet had been washed away by a change in the\r\ncurrents, and it is clear that a coating of growing coral had been\r\nformed in a short time.[1114] Experiments, also, of Dr. Allan, on the\r\neast coast of Madagascar, prove the possibility of coral growing to a\r\nthickness of three feet in about half a year,[1115] so that the rate of\r\nincrease may, under favorable circumstances, be very far from slow.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the calcareous masses termed coral reefs\r\nare exclusively the work of zoophytes: a great variety of shells, and,\r\namong them, some of the largest and heaviest of known species,\r\ncontribute to augment the mass. In the South Pacific, great beds of\r\noysters, mussels, _Pinnae marinae_, _Chamoe_ (or _Tridacnae_), and other\r\nshells, cover in profusion almost every reef; and on the beach of coral\r\nislands are seen the shells of echini and broken fragments of\r\ncrustaceous animals. Large shoals of fish are also discernible through\r\nthe clear blue water, and their teeth and hard palates cannot fail to be\r\noften preserved although their soft cartilaginous bones may decay.\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of the German naturalist Forster, in 1780, after his\r\nvoyage round the world with Captain Cook, that coral animals had the\r\npower of building up steep and almost perpendicular walls from great\r\ndepths in the sea, a notion afterwards adopted by Captain Flinders and\r\nothers; but it is now very generally believed that these zoophytes\r\ncannot live in water of great depths.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin has come to the conclusion, that those species which are most\r\neffective in the construction of reefs, rarely flourish at a greater\r\ndepth than 20 fathoms, or 120 feet. In some lagoons, however, where the\r\nwater is but little agitated, there are, according to Kotzebue, beds of\r\nliving coral in 25 fathoms of water, or 150 feet; but these may perhaps\r\nhave begun to live in shallower water, and may have been carried\r\ndownwards by the subsidence of the reef. There are also various species\r\nof zoophytes, and among them some which are provided with calcareous as\r\nwell as horny stems, which live in much deeper water, even in some cases\r\nto a depth of 180 fathoms; but these do not appear to give origin to\r\nstony reefs.\r\n\r\nThere is every variety of form in coral reefs, but the most remarkable\r\nand numerous in the Pacific consist of circular or oval strips of dry\r\nland, enclosing a shallow lake or lagoon of still water, in which\r\nzoophytes and mollusca abound. These annular reefs just raise themselves\r\nabove the level of the sea, and are surrounded by a deep and often\r\nunfathomable ocean.\r\n\r\nIn the annexed cut (fig. 114), one of these circular islands is\r\nrepresented, just rising above the waves, covered with the cocoa-nut and\r\nother trees, and inclosing within a lagoon of tranquil water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114.\r\n\r\nView of Whitsunday Island. (Capt. Beechey.)[1116]]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying section will enable the reader to comprehend the usual\r\nform of such islands. (Fig. 115.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115.\r\n\r\nSection of a Coral Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _a_, _a_, Habitable part of the island, consisting of a strip\r\n              of coral, inclosing the lagoon.\r\n  _b_, _b_, The lagoon.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe subjoined cut (fig. 116.) exhibits a small part of the section of a\r\ncoral island on a larger scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116.\r\n\r\nSection of part of a Coral Island.\r\n\r\n_a_, _b_, Habitable part of the island.\r\n\r\n_b_, _c_, Slope of the side of the island, plunging at an angle of\r\nforty-five to the depth of fifteen hundred feet.\r\n\r\n_c_, _c_, Part of the lagoon.\r\n\r\n_d_, _d_, Knolls of coral in the lagoon, with overhanging masses of\r\ncoral resembling the capitals of columns.]\r\n\r\nOf thirty-two of these coral islands visited by Beechey in his voyage to\r\nthe Pacific, twenty-nine had lagoons in their centres. The largest was\r\n30 miles in diameter, and the smallest less than a mile. All were\r\nincreasing their dimensions by the active operations of the lithophytes,\r\nwhich appeared to be gradually extending and bringing the immersed parts\r\nof their structure to the surface. The scene presented by these annular\r\nreefs is equally striking for its singularity and beauty. A strip of\r\nland a few hundred yards wide is covered by lofty cocoa-nut trees, above\r\nwhich is the blue vault of heaven. This band of verdure is bounded by a\r\nbeach of glittering white sand, the outer margin of which is encircled\r\nwith a ring of snow-white breakers, beyond which are the dark heaving\r\nwaters of the ocean. The inner beach incloses the still clear water of\r\nthe lagoon, resting in its greater part on white sand, and when\r\nilluminated by a vertical sun, of a most vivid green.[1117] Certain\r\nspecies of zoophytes abound most in the lagoon, others on the exterior\r\nmargin, where there is a great surf. \"The ocean,\" says Mr. Darwin,\r\n\"throwing its breakers on these outer shores, appears an invincible\r\nenemy, yet we see it resisted and even conquered by means which at first\r\nseem most weak and inefficient. No periods of repose are granted, and\r\nthe long swell caused by the steady action of the trade wind never\r\nceases. The breakers exceed in violence those of our temperate regions,\r\nand it is impossible to behold them without feeling a conviction that\r\nrocks of granite or quartz would ultimately yield and be demolished by\r\nsuch irresistible forces. Yet these low insignificant coral islets stand\r\nand are victorious, for here another power, as antagonist to the former,\r\ntakes part in the contest. The organic forces separate the atoms of\r\ncarbonate of lime one by one from the foaming breakers, and unite them\r\ninto a symmetrical structure; myriads of architects are at work night\r\nand day, month after month, and we see their soft and gelatinous bodies\r\nthrough the agency of the vital laws conquering the great mechanical\r\npower of the waves of an ocean, which neither the art of man, nor the\r\ninanimate works of nature could successfully resist.\"[1118]\r\n\r\nAs the coral animals require to be continually immersed in salt water,\r\nthey cannot raise themselves by their own efforts, above the level of\r\nthe lowest tides. The manner in which the reefs are converted into\r\nislands above the level of the sea is thus described by Chamisso, a\r\nnaturalist, who accompanied Kotzebue in his voyages:--\"When the reef,\"\r\nsays he, \"is of such a height that it remains almost dry at low water\r\nthe corals leave off building. Above this line a continuous mass of\r\nsolid stone is seen composed of the shells of mollusks and echini, with\r\ntheir broken-off prickles and fragments of coral, united by calcareous\r\nsand, produced by the pulverization of shells. The heat of the sun often\r\npenetrates the mass of stone when it is dry, so that it splits in many\r\nplaces, and the force of the waves is thereby enabled to separate and\r\nlift blocks of coral, frequently six feet long and three or four in\r\nthickness, and throw them upon the reef, by which means the ridge\r\nbecomes at length so high that it is covered only during some seasons of\r\nthe year by the spring tides. After this the calcareous sand lies\r\nundisturbed, and offers to the seeds of trees and plants cast upon it by\r\nthe waves a soil upon which they rapidly grow, to overshadow its\r\ndazzling white surface. Entire trunks of trees, which are carried by the\r\nrivers from other countries and islands, find here, at length, a\r\nresting-place after their long wanderings: with these come some small\r\nanimals such as insects and lizards, as the first inhabitants. Even\r\nbefore the trees form a wood, the sea-birds nestle here; stray\r\nland-birds take refuge in the bushes; and, at a much later period, when\r\nthe work has been long since completed, man appears and builds his hut\r\non the fruitful soil.\"[1119]\r\n\r\nIn the above description the solid stone is stated to consist of shell\r\nand coral, united by sand; but masses of very compact limestone are also\r\nfound even in the uppermost and newest parts of the reef, such as could\r\nonly have been produced by chemical precipitation. Professor Agassiz\r\nalso informs me that his observations on the Florida reefs (which\r\nconfirm Darwin's theory of atolls to be mentioned in the sequel) have\r\nconvinced him, that large blocks are loosened, not by shrinkage in the\r\nsun's heat, as Chamisso imagined, but by innumerable perforations of\r\nlithodomi and other boring testacea.\r\n\r\nThe carbonate of lime may have been principally derived from the\r\ndecomposition of corals and testacea; for when the animal matter\r\nundergoes putrefaction, the calcareous residuum must be set free under\r\ncircumstances very favorable to precipitation, especially when there are\r\nother calcareous substances, such as shells and corals, on which it may\r\nbe deposited. Thus organic bodies may be inclosed in a solid cement, and\r\nbecome portions of rocky masses.[1120]\r\n\r\nThe width of the circular strip of dead coral forming the islands\r\nexplored by Captain Beechey, exceeded in no instance half a mile from\r\nthe usual wash of the sea to the edge of the lagoon, and, in general,\r\nwas only about three or four hundred yards.[1121] The depth of the\r\nlagoons is various; in some, entered by Captain Beechey, it was from\r\ntwenty to thirty-eight fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe two other peculiarities which are most characteristic of the annular\r\nreef or atoll are first, that the strip of dead coral is invariably\r\nhighest on the windward side, and secondly, that there is very generally\r\nan opening at some point in the reef affording a narrow passage, often\r\nof considerable depth, from the sea into the lagoon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117.]\r\n\r\n_Maldive and Laccadive Isles._--The chain of reefs and islets called the\r\nMaldives (see fig. 117.), situated in the Indian Ocean, to the\r\nsouth-west of Malabar, forms a chain 470 geographical miles in length,\r\nrunning due north and south, with an average breadth of about 50 miles.\r\nIt is composed throughout of a series of circular assemblages of islets,\r\nall formed of coral, the larger groups being from forty to ninety miles\r\nin their longest diameter. Captain Horsburgh, whose chart of these\r\nislands is subjoined, states, that outside of each circle or _atoll_, as\r\nit is termed, there are coral reefs sometimes extending to the distance\r\nof two or three miles, beyond which there are no soundings at immense\r\ndepths. But in the centre of each atoll there is a lagoon from fifteen\r\nto forty-nine fathoms deep. In the channels between the atolls no\r\nsoundings can usually be obtained at the depth of 150 or even 250\r\nfathoms, but during Captain Moresby's survey, soundings were struck at\r\n150 and 200 fathoms, the only instances as yet known of the bottom\r\nhaving been reached, either in the Indian or Pacific oceans, in a space\r\nintervening between two separate and well characterized atolls.\r\n\r\nThe singularity in the form of the atolls of this archipelago consists\r\nin their being made up, not of one continuous circular reef but of a\r\nring of small coral islets sometimes more than a hundred in number, each\r\nof which is a miniature atoll in itself; in other words, a ring-shaped\r\nstrip of coral surrounding a lagoon of salt water. To account for the\r\norigin of these, Mr. Darwin supposes the larger annular reef to have\r\nbeen broken up into a number of fragments, each of which acquired its\r\npeculiar configurations under the influence of causes similar to those\r\nto which the structure of the parent atoll has been due. Many of the\r\nminor rings are no less than three, and even five miles in diameter, and\r\nsome are situated in the midst of the principal lagoon; but this happens\r\nonly in cases where the sea can enter freely through breaches in the\r\nouter or marginal reef.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the Maldives are composed of sandstone formed of broken\r\nshells and corals, such as may be obtained in a loose state from the\r\nbeach, and which is seen when exposed for a few days to the air to\r\nbecome hardened. The sandstone is sometimes observed to be an aggregate\r\nof broken shells, corals, pieces of wood, and shells of the\r\ncocoa-nut.[1122]\r\n\r\nThe Laccadive islands run in the same line with the Maldives, on the\r\nnorth, as do the isles of the Chagos Archipelago, on the south; so that\r\nthese may be continuations of the same chain of submerged mountains,\r\ncrested in a similar manner by coral limestones.\r\n\r\n_Origin of the circular form--not volcanic._--The circular and oval\r\nshape of so many reefs, each having a lagoon in the centre, and being\r\nsurrounded on all sides by a deep ocean, naturally suggested the idea\r\nthat they were nothing more than the crests of submarine volcanic\r\ncraters overgrown by coral; and this theory I myself advocated in the\r\nearlier editions of this work. Although I am now about to show that it\r\nmust be abandoned, it may still be instructive to point out the grounds\r\non which it was formerly embraced. In the first place, it had been\r\nremarked that there were many active volcanoes in the coral region of\r\nthe Pacific, and that in some places, as in Gambier's group, rocks\r\ncomposed of porous lava rise up in a lagoon bordered by a circular reef,\r\njust as the two cones of eruption called the Kamenis have made their\r\nappearance in the times of history within the circular gulf of\r\nSantorin.[1123] It was also observed that, as in S. Shetland, Barren\r\nIsland, and others of volcanic origin, there is one narrow breach in the\r\nwalls of the outer cone by which ships may enter a circular gulf, so in\r\nlike manner there is often a single deep passage leading into the lagoon\r\nof a coral island, the lagoon itself seeming to represent the hollow or\r\ngulf just as the ring of dry coral recalls to our minds the rim of a\r\nvolcanic crater. More lately, indeed, Mr. Darwin has shown that the\r\nnumerous volcanic craters of the Galapagos Archipelago in the Pacific\r\nhave all of them their southern sides the lowest, or in many cases quite\r\nbroken down, so that if they were submerged and incrusted with coral,\r\nthey would resemble true atolls in shape.[1124]\r\n\r\nAnother argument which I adduced when formerly defending this doctrine\r\nwas derived from Ehrenberg's statement, that some banks of coral in the\r\nRed Sea were square, while many others were ribbon-like strips, with\r\nflat tops, and without lagoons. Since, therefore, all the genera and\r\nmany of the species of zoophytes in the Red Sea agreed with those which\r\nelsewhere construct lagoon islands, it followed that the stone-making\r\nzoophytes are not guided by their own instinct in the formation of\r\nannular reefs, but that this peculiar shape and the position of such\r\nreefs in the midst of a deep ocean must depend on the outline of the\r\nsubmarine bottom, which resembles nothing else in nature but the crater\r\nof a lofty submerged volcanic cone. The enormous size, it is true, of\r\nsome atolls, made it necessary for me to ascribe to the craters of many\r\nsubmarine volcanoes a magnitude which was startling, and which had often\r\nbeen appealed to as a serious objection to the volcanic theory. That so\r\nmany of them were of the same height, or just level with the water, did\r\nnot present a difficulty so long as we remained ignorant of the fact\r\nthat the reef-building species do not grow at greater depths than\r\ntwenty-five fathoms.\r\n\r\n_May be explained by subsidence._--Mr. Darwin, after examining a variety\r\nof coral formations in different parts of the globe, was induced to\r\nreject the opinion that their shape represented the form of the original\r\nbottom. Instead of admitting that the ring of dead coral rested on a\r\ncircular or oval ridge of rock, or that the lagoon corresponded to a\r\npreexisting cavity, he advanced a new opinion, which must, at first\r\nsight, seem paradoxical in the extreme; namely, that the lagoon is\r\nprecisely in the place once occupied by the highest part of a\r\nmountainous island, or, in other cases, by the top of a shoal.\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief sketch of the facts and arguments in favor of\r\nthis new view:--Besides those rings of dry coral which enclose lagoons,\r\nthere are others having a similar form and structure which encircle\r\nlofty islands. Of the latter kind is Vanikoro, (see map, fig. 39, p.\r\n351,) celebrated on account of the shipwreck of La Peyrouse, where the\r\ncoral reef runs at the distance of two or three miles from the shore,\r\nthe channel between it and the land having a general depth of between\r\n200 and 300 feet. This channel, therefore, is analogous to a lagoon, but\r\nwith an island standing in the middle like a picture in its frame. In\r\nlike manner in Tahiti we see a mountainous land, with everywhere round\r\nits margin a lake or zone of smooth salt water, separated from the ocean\r\nby an encircling reef of coral, on which a line of breakers is always\r\nfoaming. So also New Caledonia, a long narrow island east of New\r\nHolland, in which the rocks are granitic, is surrounded by a reef which\r\nruns for a length of 400 miles. This reef encompasses not only the\r\nisland itself, but a ridge of rocks which are prolonged in the same\r\ndirection beneath the sea. No one, therefore, will contend for a moment\r\nthat in this case the corals are based upon the rim of a volcanic\r\ncrater, in the middle of which stands a mountain or island of granite.\r\n\r\nThe great barrier reef, already mentioned as running parallel to the\r\nnorth-east coast of Australia for nearly 1000 miles, is another most\r\nremarkable example of a long strip of coral running parallel to a coast.\r\nIts distance from the mainland varies from twenty to seventy miles, and\r\nthe depth of the great arm of the sea thus enclosed is usually between\r\nten and twenty fathoms, but towards one end from forty to sixty. This\r\ngreat reef would extend much farther, according to Mr. Jukes, if the\r\ngrowth of coral were not prevented off the shores of New Guinea by a\r\nmuddy bottom, caused by rivers charged with sediment which flow from the\r\nsouthern coast of that great island.[1125]\r\n\r\nTwo classes of reefs, therefore, have now been considered; first, the\r\natoll, and, secondly, the encircling and barrier reef, all agreeing\r\nperfectly in structure, and the sole difference lying in the absence in\r\nthe case of the atoll of all land, and in the others the presence of\r\nland bounded either by an encircling or a barrier reef. But there is\r\nstill a third class of reefs, called by Mr. Darwin \"fringing reefs,\"\r\nwhich approach much nearer the land than those of the encircling and\r\nbarrier class, and which indeed so nearly touched the coast as to leave\r\nnothing in the intervening space resembling a lagoon. \"That these reefs\r\nare not attached quite close to the shore appears to be the result of\r\ntwo causes; first, that the water immediately adjoining the beach is\r\nrendered turbid by the surf, and therefore injurious to all zoophytes;\r\nand, secondly, that the larger and efficient kinds only flourish on the\r\nouter edge amidst the breakers of the open sea.\"[1126]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118.\r\n\r\nSupposed section of an island with an encircling reef of coral.\r\n\r\nA, The island.\r\n\r\n_b_, _c_, Highest points of the encircling reef between which and the\r\ncoast is seen a space occupied by still water.]\r\n\r\nIt will at once be conceded that there is so much analogy between the\r\nform and position of the strip of coral in the atoll, and in the\r\nencircling and barrier reef, that no explanation can be satisfactory\r\nwhich does not include the whole. If we turn in the first place to the\r\nencircling and barrier reefs, and endeavor to explain how the zoophytes\r\ncould have found a bottom on which to begin to build, we are met at once\r\nwith a great difficulty. It is a general fact, long since remarked by\r\nDampier, that high land and deep seas go together. In other words, steep\r\nmountains coming down abruptly to the sea-shore are generally continued\r\nwith the same slope beneath the water. But where the reef, as at _b_ and\r\n_c_ (fig. 118), is distant several miles from a steep coast, a line\r\ndrawn perpendicularly downwards from its outer edges _b c_ to the\r\nfundamental rock _d e_, must descend to a depth exceeding by several\r\nthousand feet the limits at which the efficient stone-building corals\r\ncan exist, for we have seen that they cease to grow in water which is\r\nmore than 120 feet deep. That the original root immediately beneath the\r\npoints _b c_ is actually as far from the surface as _d e_, is not merely\r\ninferred from Dampier's rule, but confirmed by the fact, that,\r\nimmediately outside the reef, soundings are either not met with at all,\r\nor only at enormous depths. In short, the ocean is as deep there as\r\nmight have been anticipated in the neighborhood of a bold coast; and it\r\nis obviously the presence of the coral alone which has given rise to the\r\nanomalous existence of shallow water on the reef and between it and the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nAfter studying in minute detail all the phenomena above described, Mr.\r\nDarwin has offered in explanation a theory now very generally adopted.\r\nThe coral-forming polypi, he states, begin to build in water of a\r\nmoderate depth, and while they are yet at work, the bottom of the sea\r\nsubsides gradually, so that the foundation of their edifice is carried\r\ndownwards at the same time that they are raising the superstructure. If,\r\ntherefore, the rate of subsidence be not too rapid, the growing coral\r\nwill continue to build up to the surface; the mass always gaining in\r\nheight above its original base, but remaining in other respects in the\r\nsame position. Not so with the land; each inch lost is irreclaimably\r\ngone; as it sinks, the water gains foot by foot on the shore, till in\r\nmany cases the highest peak of the original island disappears. What was\r\nbefore land is then occupied by the lagoon, the position of the\r\nencircling coral remaining unaltered, with the exception of a slight\r\ncontraction of its dimensions.\r\n\r\nIn this manner are encircling reefs and atolls produced; and in\r\nconfirmation of his views Mr. Darwin has pointed out examples which\r\nillustrate every intermediate state, from that of lofty islands, such as\r\nOtaheite, encircled by coral, to that of Gambier's group, where a few\r\npeaks only of land rise out of a lagoon, and lastly, to the perfect\r\natoll, having a lagoon several hundred feet deep, surrounded by a reef\r\nrising steeply from an unfathomed ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119.]\r\n\r\nIf we embrace these views, it is clear, that in regions of growing coral\r\na similar subsidence must give rise to barrier reefs along the shores of\r\na continent. Thus suppose A (fig. 119), to represent the north-east\r\nportion of Australia, and _b c_ the ancient level of the sea, when the\r\ncoral reef _d_ was formed. If the land sink so that it is submerged more\r\nand more, the sea must at length stand at the level _e f_, the reef in\r\nthe mean time having been enlarged and raised to the point _g_. The\r\ndistance between the shore _f_, and the barrier reef _g_, is now much\r\ngreater than originally between the shore _c_ and the reef _d_, and the\r\nlonger the subsidence continues the farther will the coast of the\r\nmainland recede.\r\n\r\nWhen the first edition of this work appeared in 1831, several years\r\nbefore Mr. Darwin had investigated the facts on which his theory is\r\nfounded, I had come to the opinion that the land was subsiding at the\r\nbottom of those parts of the Pacific where atolls are numerous, although\r\nI failed to perceive that such a subsidence, if conceded, would equally\r\nsolve the enigma as to the form both of annular and barrier reefs.\r\n\r\nI shall cite the passage referred to, as published by me in 1831:--\"It\r\nis a remarkable circumstance that there should be so vast an area in\r\nEastern Oceanica, studded with minute islands, without one single spot\r\nwhere there is a wider extent of land than belongs to such islands as\r\nOtaheite, Owhyhee, and a few others, which either have been or are still\r\nthe seats of active volcanoes. If an equilibrium only were maintained\r\nbetween the upheaving and depressing force of earthquakes, large islands\r\nwould very soon be formed in the Pacific; for, in that case, the growth\r\nof limestone, the flowing of lava, and the ejection of volcanic ashes,\r\nwould combine with the upheaving force to form new land.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose a shoal, 600 miles in length, to sink fifteen feet, and then to\r\nremain unmoved for a thousand years; during that interval the growing\r\ncoral may again approach the surface. Then let the mass be re-elevated\r\nfifteen feet, so that the original reef is restored to its former\r\nposition: in this case, the new coral formed since the first subsidence\r\nwill constitute an island 600 miles long. An analogous result would have\r\noccurred if a lava-current fifteen feet thick had overflowed the\r\nsubmerged reef. The absence, therefore, of more extensive tracts of land\r\nin the Pacific, seems to show that the amount of subsidence by\r\nearthquakes exceeds, in that quarter of the globe, at present, the\r\nelevation due to the same cause.\"[1127]\r\n\r\nAnother proof also of subsidence derived from the structure of atolls,\r\nwas pointed out by me in the following passage in all former editions.\r\n\"The low coral islands of the Pacific,\" says Captain Beechey, \"follow\r\none general rule in having their windward side higher and more perfect\r\nthan the other. At Gambia and Matilda islands this inequality is very\r\nconspicuous, the weather side of both being wooded, and of the former\r\ninhabited, while the other sides are from twenty to thirty feet under\r\nwater; where, however, they may be perceived to be equally _narrow_ and\r\nwell defined. It is on the leeward side also that the entrances into the\r\nlagoons occur; and although they may sometimes be situated on a side\r\nthat runs in the direction of the wind, as at Bow Island, yet there are\r\nnone to windward.\" These observations of Captain Beechey accord with\r\nthose which Captain Horsburgh and other hydrographers have made in\r\nregard to the coral islands of other seas. From this fortunate\r\ncircumstance ships can enter and sail out with ease; whereas if the\r\nnarrow inlets were to windward, vessels which once entered might not\r\nsucceed for months in making their way out again. The well-known\r\nsecurity of many of these harbors depends entirely on this fortunate\r\npeculiarity in their structure.\r\n\r\n\"In what manner is this singular conformation to be accounted for? The\r\naction of the waves is seen to be the cause of the superior elevation\r\nof some reefs on their windward sides, where sand and large masses of\r\ncoral rock are thrown up by the breakers; but there is a variety of\r\ncases where this cause alone is inadequate to solve the problem; for\r\nreefs submerged at considerable depths, where the movements of the sea\r\ncannot exert much power, have, nevertheless, the same conformation, the\r\nleeward being much lower than the windward side.[1128]\r\n\r\n\"I am informed by Captain King, that, on examining the reefs called\r\nRowley Shoals, which lie off the north-west coast of Australia, where\r\nthe east and west monsoons prevail alternately, he found the open side\r\nof one crescent-shaped reef, the Imparieuse, turned to the east, and of\r\nanother, the Mermaid, turned to the west; while a third oval reef, of\r\nthe same group, was entirely submerged. This want of conformity is\r\nexactly what we should expect, where the winds vary periodically.\r\n\r\n\"It seems impossible to refer the phenomenon now under consideration to\r\nany original uniformity in the configuration of submarine volcanoes, on\r\nthe summits of which we may suppose the coral reefs to grow; for\r\nalthough it is very common for craters to be broken down on one side\r\nonly, we cannot imagine any cause that should breach them all in the\r\nsame direction. But the difficulty will, perhaps, be removed, if we call\r\nin another part of the volcanic agency--subsidence by earthquakes.\r\nSuppose the windward barrier to have been raised by the mechanical\r\naction of the waves to the height of two or three yards above the wall\r\non the leeward side, and then the whole island to sink down a few\r\nfathoms, the appearances described would then be presented by the\r\nsubmerged reef. A repetition of such operations, by the alternate\r\nelevation and depression of the same mass (an hypothesis strictly\r\nconformable to analogy), might produce still greater inequality in the\r\ntwo sides, especially as the violent efflux of the tide has probably a\r\nstrong tendency to check the accumulation of the more tender corals on\r\nthe leeward reef; while the action of the breakers contributes to raise\r\nthe windward barrier.\"[1129]\r\n\r\nPreviously to my adverting to the signs above enumerated of a downward\r\nmovement in the bed of the ocean, Dr. MacCulloch, Captain Beechey, and\r\nmany other writers, had shown that masses of recent coral had been laid\r\ndry at various heights above the sea-level, both in the Red Sea, the\r\nislands of the Pacific, and in the East and West Indies. After\r\ndescribing thirty-two coral islands in the Pacific, Captain Beechey\r\nmentioned that they were all formed of living coral except one, which,\r\nalthough of coral formation, was raised about seventy or eighty feet\r\nabove the level of the sea, and was encompassed by a reef of living\r\ncoral. It is called Elizabeth or Henderson's Island, and is five miles\r\nin length by one in breadth. It has a flat surface, and, on all sides,\r\nexcept the north, is bounded by perpendicular cliffs about fifty feet\r\nhigh, composed entirely of dead coral, more or less porous, honey-combed\r\nat the surface, and hardening into a compact calcareous mass, which\r\npossesses the fracture of secondary limestone, and has a species of\r\nmillepore interspersed through it. These cliffs are considerably\r\nundermined by the action of the waves, and some of them appear on the\r\neve of precipitating their superincumbent weight into the sea. Those\r\nwhich are less injured in this way present no alternate ridges or\r\nindication of the different levels which the sea might have occupied at\r\ndifferent periods; but a smooth surface, as if the island, which has\r\nprobably been raised by volcanic agency, had been forced up by one great\r\nsubterraneous convulsion.[1130] At the distance of a few hundred yards\r\nfrom this island, no bottom could be gained with 200 fathoms of line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, or Henderson's Island.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, from the annexed sketch, communicated to me by\r\nLieutenant Smith, of the Blossom, that the trees came down to the beach\r\ntowards the centre of the island; a break at first sight resembling the\r\nopenings which usually lead into lagoons; but the trees stand on a steep\r\nslope, and no hollow of an ancient lagoon was perceived.\r\n\r\nBeechey also remarks, that the surface of Henderson's Island is flat,\r\nand that in Queen Charlotte's Island, one of the same group, but under\r\nwater, there was no lagoon, the coral having grown up everywhere to one\r\nlevel. The probable cause of this obliteration of the central basin or\r\nlagoon will be considered in the sequel.\r\n\r\nThat the bed of the Pacific and Indian oceans, where atolls are\r\nfrequent, must have been sinking for ages, might be inferred, says Mr.\r\nDarwin, from simply reflecting on two facts; first, that the efficient\r\ncoral-building zoophytes do not flourish in the ocean at a greater depth\r\nthan 120 feet; and, secondly, that there are spaces occupying areas of\r\nmany hundred thousand square miles, where all the islands consist of\r\ncoral, and yet none of which rise to a greater height than may be\r\naccounted for by the action of the winds and waves on broken and\r\ntriturated coral. Were we to take for granted that the floor of the\r\nocean had remained stationary from the time when the coral began to\r\ngrow, we should be compelled to assume that an incredible number of\r\nsubmarine mountains of vast height (for the ocean is always deep, and\r\noften unfathomable between the different atolls) had all come to within\r\n120 feet of the surface, and yet no one mountain had risen above water.\r\nBut no sooner do we admit the theory of subsidence, than this great,\r\ndifficulty vanishes. However varied may have been the altitude of\r\ndifferent islands, or the separate peaks of particular mountain-chains,\r\nall may have been reduced to one uniform level by the gradual\r\nsubmergence of the loftiest points, and the additions made to the\r\ncalcareous cappings of the less elevated summits as they subsided to\r\ngreat depths.\r\n\r\n_Openings into the lagoons._--In the general description of atolls and\r\nencircling reefs, it was mentioned that there is almost always a deep\r\nnarrow passage opening into the lagoon, or into the still water between\r\nthe reef and the shore, which is kept open by the efflux of the sea as\r\nthe tide goes down.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this channel must, according to the theory of subsidence\r\nbefore explained, be traced back to causes which were in action during\r\nthe existence of the encircling reef, and when an island or mountain-top\r\nrose within it, for such a reef precedes the atoll in the order of\r\nformation. Now in those islands in the Pacific, which are large enough\r\nto feed small rivers, there is generally an opening or channel in the\r\nsurrounding coral reef at the point where the stream of fresh water\r\nenters the sea. The depth of these channels rarely exceeds twenty-five\r\nfeet; and they may be attributed, says Captain Beechey, to the aversion\r\nof the lithophytes to fresh water, and to the probable absence of the\r\nmineral matter of which they construct their habitations.[1131]\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, however, has shown, that mud at the bottom of river-courses\r\nis far more influential than the freshness of the water in preventing\r\nthe growth of the polypi, for the walls which inclose the openings are\r\nperpendicular, and do not slant off gradually, as would be the case, if\r\nthe nature of the element presented the only obstacle to the increase of\r\nthe coral-building animals.\r\n\r\nWhen a breach has thus been made in the reef, it will be prevented from\r\nclosing up by the efflux of the sea at low tides; for it is sufficient\r\nthat a reef should rise a few feet above low-water mark to cause the\r\nwaters to collect in the lagoon at high tide, and when the sea falls, to\r\nrush out at one or more points where the reef happens to be lowest or\r\nweakest. This event is strictly analogous to that witnessed in our\r\nestuaries, where a body of salt water accumulated during the flow issues\r\nwith great velocity at the ebb of the tide, and scours out or keeps open\r\na deep passage through the bar, which is almost always formed at the\r\nmouth of a river. At first there are probably many openings, but the\r\ngrowth of the coral tends to obstruct all those which do not serve as\r\nthe principal channels of discharge; so that their number is gradually\r\nreduced to a few, and often finally to one. The fact observed\r\nuniversally, that the principal opening fronts a considerable valley in\r\nthe encircled island, between the shores of which and the outer reef\r\nthere is often deep water, scarcely leaves any doubt as to the real\r\norigin of the channel in all those countless atolls where the nucleus of\r\nland has vanished.\r\n\r\n_Size of atolls and barrier reefs._--In regard to the dimensions of\r\natolls, it was stated that some of the smallest observed by Beechey in\r\nthe Pacific were only a mile in diameter. If their external slope under\r\nwater equals upon an average an angle of 45 degrees, then would such an\r\natoll at the depth of half a mile, or 2640 feet, have a diameter of two\r\nmiles. Hence it would appear that there must be a tendency in every\r\natoll to grow smaller, except in those cases where oscillations of level\r\nenlarge the base on which the coral grows by throwing down a talus of\r\ndetrital matter all round the original cone of limestone.\r\n\r\nBow Island is described by Captain Beechey as seventy miles in\r\ncircumference, and thirty in its greatest diameter, but we have seen\r\nthat some of the Maldives are much larger.\r\n\r\nAs the shore of an island or continent which is subsiding will recede\r\nfrom a coral reef at a slow or rapid rate according as the surface of\r\nthe land has a steep or gentle slope, we cannot measure the thickness of\r\nthe coral by its distance from the coast; yet, as a general rule, those\r\nreefs which are farthest from the land imply the greatest amount of\r\nsubsidence. We learn from Flinders, that the barrier reef of\r\nnorth-eastern Australia is in some places seventy miles from the\r\nmainland, and it should seem that a calcareous formation is there in\r\nprogress 1000 miles long from north to south, with a breadth varying\r\nfrom twenty to seventy miles. It may not, indeed, be continuous over\r\nthis vast area, for doubtless innumerable islands have been submerged\r\none after another between the reef and mainland, like some which still\r\nremain, as, for example, Murray's Islands, lat. 9 degrees 54 minutes S.\r\nWe are also told that some parts of the gulf inclosed within a barrier\r\nare 400 feet deep, so that the efficient rock-building corals cannot be\r\ngrowing there, and in other parts of it islands appear encircled by\r\nreefs.\r\n\r\nIt will follow as one of the consequences of the theory already\r\nexplained that, provided the bottom of the sea does not sink too fast to\r\nallow the zoophytes to build upwards at the same pace, the thickness of\r\ncoral will be great in proportion to the rapidity of subsidence, so that\r\nif one area sinks two feet while another sinks one, the mass of coral in\r\nthe first area will be double that in the second. But the downward\r\nmovement must in general have been very slow and uniform, or where\r\nintermittent, must have consisted of a great number of depressions, each\r\nof slight amount, otherwise the bottom of the sea would have been\r\ncarried down faster than the corals could build upwards, and the island\r\nor continent would be permanently submerged, having reached a depth of\r\n120 or 150 feet, at which the effective reef-constructing zoophytes\r\ncease to live. If, then, the subsidence required to account for all the\r\nexisting atolls must have amounted to three or four thousand feet, or\r\neven sometimes more, we are brought to the conclusion that there has\r\nbeen a _slow_ and _gradual_ sinking to this enormous extent. Such an\r\ninference is perfectly in harmony with views which the grand scale of\r\ndenudation, everywhere observable in the older rocks, has led geologists\r\nto adopt in reference to upward movements. They must also have been\r\ngradual and continuous throughout indefinite ages to allow the waves and\r\ncurrents of the ocean to operate with adequate power.\r\n\r\nThe map constructed by Mr. Darwin to display at one view the\r\ngeographical position of all the coral reefs throughout the globe is of\r\nthe highest geological interest (see above, p. 351.), leading to\r\nsplendid generalizations, when we have once embraced the theory that all\r\natolls and barrier reefs indicate recent subsidence, while the presence\r\nof fringing reefs proves the land to be stationary or rising. These two\r\nclasses of coral formations are depicted by different colors; and one of\r\nthe striking facts brought to light by the same classification of coral\r\nformations is the absence of active volcanoes in the areas of\r\nsubsidence, and their frequent presence in the areas of elevation. The\r\nonly supposed exception to this remarkable coincidence at the time when\r\nMr. Darwin wrote, in 1842, was the volcano of Torres Strait, at the\r\nnorthern point of Australia, placed on the borders of an area of\r\nsubsidence; but it has been since proved that this volcano has no\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, an evident connection, first, between the bursting\r\nforth every now and then of volcanic matter through rents and fissures,\r\nand the expansion or forcing outwards of the earth's crust, and,\r\nsecondly, between a dormant and less energetic development of\r\nsubterranean heat, and an amount of subsidence sufficiently great to\r\ncause mountains to disappear over the broad face of the ocean, leaving\r\nonly small and scattered lagoon islands, or groups of atolls, to\r\nindicate the spots where those mountains once stood.\r\n\r\nOn a review of the differently-colored reefs on the map alluded to, it\r\nwill be seen that there are large spaces in which upheaval, and others\r\nin which depression prevails, and these are placed alternately, while\r\nthere are a few smaller areas where movements of oscillation occur. Thus\r\nif we commence with the western shores of South America, between the\r\nsummit of the Andes and the Pacific (a region of earthquakes and active\r\nvolcanoes), we find signs of recent elevation, not attested indeed by\r\ncoral formations, which are wanting there, but by upraised banks of\r\nmarine shells. Then proceeding westward, we traverse a deep ocean\r\nwithout islands, until we come to a band of _atolls_ and encircled\r\nislands, including the Dangerous and Society archipelagoes, and\r\nconstituting an area of subsidence more than 4000 miles long and 600\r\nbroad. Still farther, in the same direction, we reach the chain of\r\nislands to which the New Hebrides, Salomon, and New Ireland belong,\r\nwhere fringing reefs and masses of elevated coral indicate another area\r\nof upheaval. Again, to the westward of the New Hebrides we meet with the\r\nencircling reef of New Caledonia and the great Australian barrier,\r\nimplying a second area of subsidence.\r\n\r\nThe only objection deserving attention which has hitherto been advanced\r\nagainst the theory of atolls, as before explained (p. 759.), is that\r\nproposed by Mr. Maclaren.[1132] \"On the outside,\" he observes, \"of coral\r\nreefs very highly inclined, no bottom is sometimes found with a line of\r\n2000 or 3000 feet, and this is by no means a rare case. It follows that\r\nthe reef ought to have this thickness; and Mr. Darwin's diagrams show\r\nthat he understood it so. Now, if such masses of coral exist under the\r\nsea, they ought somewhere to be found on _terra firma_; for there is\r\nevidence that all the lands yet visited by geologists, have been at one\r\ntime submerged. But neither in the great volcanic chain, extending from\r\nSumatra to Japan, nor in the West Indies, nor in any other region yet\r\nexplored, has a bed or formation of coral even 500 feet thick been\r\ndiscovered, so far as we know.\"\r\n\r\nWhen considering this objection, it is evident that the first question\r\nwe have to deal with is, whether geologists have not already discovered\r\ncalcareous masses of the required thickness and structure, or precisely\r\nsuch as the upheaval of atolls might be expected to expose to view? We\r\nare called upon, in short, to make up our minds both as to the internal\r\ncomposition of the rocks that must result from the growth of corals,\r\nwhether in lagoon islands or barrier reefs, and the external shape which\r\nthe reefs would retain when upraised gradually to a vast height,--a task\r\nby no means so easy as some may imagine. If the reader has pictured to\r\nhimself large masses of entire corals, piled one upon another, for a\r\nthickness of several thousand feet, he unquestionably mistakes\r\naltogether the nature of the accumulations now in progress. In the first\r\nplace, the strata at present forming very extensively over the bottom of\r\nthe ocean, within such barrier reefs as those of Australia and New\r\nCaledonia, are known to consist chiefly of horizontal layers of\r\ncalcareous sediment, while here and there an intermixture must occur of\r\nthe detritus of granitic and other rocks brought down by rivers from the\r\nadjoining lands, or washed from sea-cliffs by the waves and currents.\r\nSecondly, in regard to atolls, the stone-making polypifers grow most\r\nluxuriantly on the outer edge of the island, to a thickness of a few\r\nfeet only. Beyond this margin broken pieces of coral and calcareous sand\r\nare strewed by the breakers over a steep seaward slope, and as the\r\nsubsidence continues the next coating of live coral does not grow\r\nvertically over the first layer, but on a narrow annular space within\r\nit, the reef, as was before stated (p. 761), constantly contracting its\r\ndimensions as it sinks. Thirdly, within the lagoon the accumulation of\r\ncalcareous matter is chiefly sedimentary, a kind of chalky mud derived\r\nfrom the decay of the softer corallines, with a mixture of calcareous\r\nsand swept by the winds and waves from the surrounding circular reef.\r\nHere and there, but only in partial clumps, are found living corals,\r\nwhich grow in the middle of the lagoon, and mixed with fine mud and\r\nsand, a great variety of shells, and fragments of testacea and\r\nechinoderms.\r\n\r\nWe owe to Lieutenant Nelson the discovery that in the Bermudas the\r\ncalcareous mud resulting from the decomposition of the softer corallines\r\nis absolutely undistinguishable when dried from the ordinary white chalk\r\nof Europe,[1133] and this mud is carried to great distances by currents,\r\nand spread far and wide over the floor of the ocean. We also have\r\nopportunities of seeing in upraised atolls, such as Elizabeth Island,\r\nTonga, and Hapai, which rise above the level of the sea to heights\r\nvarying from ten to eighty feet, that the rocks of which they consist do\r\nnot differ in structure or in the state of preservation of their\r\nincluded zoophytes and shells from some of the oldest limestones known\r\nto the geologist. Captain Beechey remarks that the dead coral in\r\nElizabeth Island is more or less porous and honeycombed at the surface,\r\nand hardening into a compact rock which has the fracture of _secondary\r\nlimestone_.[1134]\r\n\r\nThe island of Pulo Nias, off Sumatra (see Map, fig. 39. p. 351), which\r\nis about 3000 feet high, is described by Dr. Jack as being overspread by\r\ncoral and large shells of the _Chama (Tridacna) gigas_, which rest on\r\nquartzose and arenaceous rocks, at various levels from the sea-coast to\r\nthe summit of the highest hills.\r\n\r\nThe cliffs of the island of Timor in the Indian Ocean are composed, says\r\nMr. Jukes, of a raised coral reef abounding in _Astraea_, _Meandrina_,\r\nand _Porites_, with shells of _Strombus_, _Conus_, _Nerita_, _Arca_,\r\n_Pecten_, _Venus_, and _Lucina_. On a ledge about 150 feet above the\r\nsea, a Tridacna (or large clam shell), two feet across, was found bedded\r\nin the rock with closed valves, just as they are often seen in barrier\r\nreefs. This formation in the islands of Sandlewood, Sumbawa, Madura, and\r\nJava, where it is exposed in sea cliffs, was found to be from 200 to 300\r\nfeet thick, and is believed to ascend to much greater heights in the\r\ninterior. It has usually the form of a \"chalk-like\" rock, white when\r\nbroken, but in the weathered surface turning nearly black.[1135]\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, premature to assert that there are no recent\r\ncoral formations uplifted to great heights, for we are only beginning to\r\nbe acquainted with the geological structure of the rocks of equatorial\r\nregions. Some of the upraised islands, such as Elizabeth and Queen\r\nCharlotte, in the Pacific, although placed in regions of atolls, are\r\ndescribed by Captain Beechey and others as flat-topped, and exhibiting\r\nno traces of lagoons. In explanation of the fact, we may presume that\r\nafter they had been sinking for ages, the descending movement was\r\nrelaxed; and while it was in the course of being converted into an\r\nascending one, the ground remained for a long season almost stationary,\r\nin which case the corals within the lagoon would build up to the\r\nsurface, and reach the level already attained by those on the margin of\r\nthe reef. In this manner the lagoon would be effaced, and the island\r\nacquire a flat summit.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be thought strange that many examples have not been\r\nnoticed of fringing reefs uplifted above the level of the sea. Mr.\r\nDarwin, indeed, cites one instance where the reef preserved, on dry land\r\nin the Mauritius, its peculiar moat-like structure; but they ought, he\r\nsays, to be of rare occurrence, for in the case of atolls or of barrier\r\nor fringing reefs, the characteristic outline must usually be destroyed\r\nby denudation as soon as a reef begins to rise; since it is immediately\r\nexposed to the action of the breakers, and the large and conspicuous\r\ncorals on the outer rim of the atoll or barrier are the first to be\r\ndestroyed and to fall to the bottom of vertical and undermined cliffs.\r\nAfter slow and continued upheaval a wreck alone can remain of the\r\noriginal reef. If, therefore, says Mr. Darwin, \"at some period as far in\r\nfuturity as the secondary rocks are in the past, the bed of the Pacific\r\nwith its atolls and barrier reefs should be converted into a continent,\r\nwe may conceive that scarcely any or none of the existing reefs would be\r\npreserved, but only widely spread strata of calcareous matter derived\r\nfrom their wear and tear.\"[1136]\r\n\r\nWhen it is urged in support of the objection before stated (p. 767),\r\nthat the theory of atolls by subsidence implies the accumulation of\r\ncalcareous formations 2000 or 3000 feet thick, it must be conceded that\r\nthis estimate of the minimum density of the deposits is by no means\r\nexaggerated. On the contrary, when we consider that the space over which\r\natolls are scattered in Polynesia and the Indian oceans may be compared\r\nto the whole continent of Asia, we cannot but infer from analogy that\r\nthe differences in level in so vast an area have amounted, antecedently\r\nto subsidence, to 5000 or even a greater number of feet. Whatever was\r\nthe difference in height between the loftiest and lowest of the original\r\nmountains or mountainous islands on which the different atolls are\r\nbased, that difference must represent the thickness of coral which has\r\nnow reduced all of them to one level. Flinders, therefore, by no means\r\nexaggerated the volume of the limestone, which he conceived to have been\r\nthe work of coral animals; he was merely mistaken as to the manner in\r\nwhich they were enabled to build reefs in an unfathomed ocean.\r\n\r\nBut is it reasonable to expect, after the waste caused by denudation,\r\nthat calcareous masses, gradually upheaved in an open sea, should retain\r\nsuch vast thicknesses? Or may not the limestones of the cretaceous and\r\noolitic epochs, which attain in the Alps and Pyrenees a density of 3000\r\nor 4000 feet, and are in great part made up of coralline and shelly\r\nmatter, present us with a true geological counterpart of the recent\r\ncoral reefs of equatorial seas?\r\n\r\nBefore we attach serious importance to arguments founded on negative\r\nevidence, and opposed to a theory which so admirably explains a great\r\nvariety of complicated phenomena, we ought to remember that the upheaval\r\nto the height of 4000 feet of atolls in which the coralline limestone\r\nwould be 4000 feet thick, implies, first, a slow subsidence of 4000\r\nfeet, and, secondly, an elevation of the same amount. Even if the\r\nreverse or ascending movement began the instant the downward one ceased,\r\nwe must allow a great lapse of ages for the accomplishment of the whole\r\noperation. We must also assume that at the commencement of the period in\r\nquestion, the equatorial regions were as fitted as now for the support\r\nof reef-building zoophytes. This postulate would demand the continuance\r\nof a complicated variety of conditions throughout a much longer period\r\nthan they are usually persistent in one place.\r\n\r\nTo show the difficulty of speculating on the permanence of the\r\ngeographical and climatal circumstances requisite for the growth of\r\nreef-building corals, we have only to state the fact that there are no\r\nreefs in the Atlantic, off the west coast of Africa, nor among the\r\nislands of the Gulf of Guinea, nor in St. Helena, Ascension, the Cape\r\nVerdes, or St. Paul's. With the exception of Bermuda, there is not a\r\nsingle coral reef in the central expanse of the Atlantic, although in\r\nsome parts the waves, as at Ascension, are charged to excess with\r\ncalcareous matter. This capricious distribution of coral reefs is\r\nprobably owing to the absence of fit stations for the reef-building\r\npolypifers, other organic beings in those regions obtaining in the great\r\nstruggle for existence a mastery over them. Their absence, in whatever\r\nmanner it be accounted for, should put us on our guard against expecting\r\nupraised reefs at all former geological epochs, similar to those now in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n_Lime, whence derived._--Dr. Maculloch, in his system of Geology, vol.\r\ni. p. 219, expressed himself in favor of the theory of some of the\r\nearlier geologists, that all limestones have originated in organized\r\nsubstances. If we examine, he says, the quantity of limestone in the\r\nprimary strata, it will be found to bear a much smaller proportion to\r\nthe siliceous and argillaceous rocks than in the secondary; and this may\r\nhave some connexion with the rarity of testaceous animals in the ancient\r\nocean. He farther infers, that in consequence of the operations of\r\nanimals, \"the quantity of calcareous earth deposited in the form of mud\r\nor stone is always increasing; and that as the secondary series far\r\nexceeds the primary in this respect, so a third series may hereafter\r\narise from the depths of the sea, which may exceed the last in the\r\nproportion of its calcareous strata.\"\r\n\r\nIf these propositions went no farther than to suggest that every\r\nparticle of lime that now enters into the crust of the globe, may\r\npossibly in its turn have been subservient to the purposes of life, by\r\nentering into the composition of organized bodies, I should not deem the\r\nspeculation improbable; but, when it is hinted that lime may be an\r\nanimal product combined by the powers of vitality from some simple\r\nelements, I can discover no sufficient grounds for such an hypothesis,\r\nand many facts militate against it.\r\n\r\nIf a large pond be made in almost any soil, and filled with rain water,\r\nit may usually become tenanted by testacea; for carbonate of lime is\r\nalmost universally diffused in small quantities. But if no calcareous\r\nmatter be supplied by waters flowing from the surrounding high grounds,\r\nor by springs, no tufa or shell-marl are formed. The thin shells of one\r\ngeneration of mollusks decompose, so that their elements afford\r\nnutriment to the succeeding races; and it is only where a stream enters\r\na lake, which may introduce a fresh supply of calcareous matter, or\r\nwhere the lake is fed by springs, that shells accumulate and form marl.\r\n\r\nAll the lakes in Forfarshire which have produced deposits of shell-marl\r\nhave been the sites of springs, which still evolve much carbonic acid,\r\nand a small quantity of carbonate of lime. But there is no marl in Loch\r\nFithie, near Forfar, where there are _no springs_, although that lake is\r\nsurrounded by these calcareous deposits, and although, in every other\r\nrespect, the site is favorable to the accumulation of aquatic testacea.\r\n\r\nWe find those Charae which secrete the largest quantity of calcareous\r\nmatter in their stems to abound near springs impregnated with carbonate\r\nof lime. We know that, if the common hen be deprived altogether of\r\ncalcareous nutriment, the shells of her eggs will become of too slight a\r\nconsistency to protect the contents; and some birds eat chalk greedily\r\nduring the breeding season.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we turn to the phenomena of inorganic nature, we\r\nobserve that, in volcanic countries, there is an enormous evolution of\r\ncarbonic acid, either free, in a gaseous form, or mixed with water; and\r\nthe springs of such districts are usually impregnated with carbonate of\r\nlime in great abundance. No one who has travelled in Tuscany, through\r\nthe region of extinct volcanos and its confines, or who has seen the map\r\nconstructed by Targioni (1827), to show the principal sites of mineral\r\nsprings, can doubt, for a moment, that if this territory was submerged\r\nbeneath the sea, it might supply materials for the most extensive coral\r\nreefs. The importance of these springs is not to be estimated by the\r\nmagnitude of the rocks which they have thrown down on the slanting sides\r\nof hills, although of these alone large cities might be built, nor by a\r\ncoating of travertin that covers the soil in some districts for miles in\r\nlength. The greater part of the calcareous matter passes down in a state\r\nof solution to the sea, and in all countries the rivers which flow from\r\nchalk and other marly and calcareous rocks carry down vast quantities of\r\nlime into the ocean. Lime is also one of the component parts of augite\r\nand other volcanic and hypogene minerals, and when these decompose is\r\nset free, and may then find its way in a state of solution to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe lime, therefore, contained generally in sea water, and secreted so\r\nplentifully by the testacea and corals of the Pacific, may have been\r\nderived either from springs rising up in the bed of the ocean, or from\r\nrivers fed by calcareous springs, or impregnated with lime derived from\r\ndisintegrated rocks, both volcanic and hypogene. If this be admitted,\r\nthe greater proportion of limestone in the more modern formations as\r\ncompared to the most ancient, will be explained, for springs in general\r\nhold no argillaceous, and but a small quantity of siliceous matter in\r\nsolution, but they are continually subtracting calcareous matter from\r\nthe inferior rocks. The constant transfer, therefore, of carbonate of\r\nlime from the lower or older portions of the earth's crust to the\r\nsurface, must cause at all periods and throughout an indefinite\r\nsuccession of geological epochs, a preponderance of calcareous matter in\r\nthe newer as contrasted with the older formations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the concluding chapters of the first book, I examined in detail a\r\ngreat variety of arguments which have been adduced to prove the\r\ndistinctness of the state of the earth's crust at remote and recent\r\nepochs. Among other supposed proofs of this distinctness, the dearth of\r\ncalcareous matter, in the ancient rocks above adverted to, might have\r\nbeen considered. But it would have been endless to enumerate all the\r\nobjections urged against those geologists who represent the course of\r\nnature at the earliest periods as resembling in all essential\r\ncircumstances the state of things now established. We have seen that, in\r\nopposition to this doctrine, a strong desire has been manifested to\r\ndiscover in the ancient rocks the signs of an epoch when the planet was\r\nuninhabited, and when its surface was in a chaotic condition and\r\nuninhabitable. The opposite opinion, indeed, that the oldest of the\r\nrocks now visible may be the last monuments of an antecedent era in\r\nwhich living beings may already have peopled the land and water, has\r\nbeen declared to be equivalent to the assumption that there never was a\r\nbeginning to the present order of things.\r\n\r\nWith equal justice might an astronomer be accused of asserting that the\r\nworks of creation extended throughout _infinite_ space, because he\r\nrefuses to take for granted that the remotest stars now seen in the\r\nheavens are on the utmost verge of the material universe. Every\r\nimprovement of the telescope has brought thousands of new worlds into\r\nview; and it would, therefore, be rash and unphilosophical to imagine\r\nthat we already survey the whole extent of the vast scheme, or that it\r\nwill ever be brought within the sphere of human observation.\r\n\r\nBut no argument can be drawn from such premises in favor of the infinity\r\nof the space that has been filled with worlds; and if the material\r\nuniverse has any limits, it then follows, that it must occupy a minute\r\nand infinitesimal point in infinite space.\r\n\r\nSo if, in tracing back the earth's history, we arrive at the monuments\r\nof events which may have happened millions of ages before our times, and\r\nif we still find no decided evidence of a commencement, yet the\r\narguments from analogy in support of the probability of a beginning\r\nremain unshaken; and if the past duration of the earth be finite, then\r\nthe aggregate of geological epochs, however numerous, must constitute a\r\nmere moment of the past, a mere infinitesimal portion of eternity.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued, that, as the different states of the earth's\r\nsurface, and the different species by which it has been inhabited have\r\nall had their origin, and many of them their termination, so the entire\r\nseries may have commenced at a certain period. It has also been urged,\r\nthat, as we admit the creation of man to have occurred at a\r\ncomparatively modern epoch--as we concede the astonishing fact of the\r\nfirst introduction of a moral and intellectual being--so also we may\r\nconceive the first creation of the planet itself.\r\n\r\nI am far from denying the weight of this reasoning from analogy; but,\r\nalthough it may strengthen our conviction, that the present system of\r\nchange has not gone on from eternity, it cannot warrant us in presuming\r\nthat we shall be permitted to behold the signs of the earth's origin, or\r\nthe evidences of the first introduction into it of organic beings. We\r\naspire in vain to assign limits to the works of creation in _space_,\r\nwhether we examine the starry heavens, or that world of minute\r\nanimalcules which is revealed to us by the microscope. We are prepared,\r\ntherefore, to find that in time also the confines of the universe lie\r\nbeyond the reach of mortal ken. But in whatever direction we pursue our\r\nresearches, whether in _time_ or space, we discover everywhere the clear\r\nproofs of a Creative Intelligence, and of His foresight, wisdom, and\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAs geologists, we learn that it is not only the present condition of the\r\nglobe which has been suited to the accommodation of myriads of living\r\ncreatures, but that many former states also have been adapted to the\r\norganization and habits of prior races of beings. The disposition of the\r\nseas, continents, and islands, and the climates, have varied; the\r\nspecies likewise have been changed; and yet they have all been so\r\nmodelled, on types analogous to those of existing plants and animals, as\r\nto indicate, throughout, a perfect harmony of design and unity of\r\npurpose. To assume that the evidence of the beginning or end of so vast\r\na scheme lies within the reach of our philosophical inquiries, or even\r\nof our speculations, appears to be inconsistent with a just estimate of\r\nthe relations which subsist between the finite powers of man and the\r\nattributes of an Infinite and Eternal Being.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n   [1] Essays on the Philosophy of the Hindoos.\r\n\r\n   [2] Institutes of Hindoo Law, or the Ordinances of Menu, from the\r\n       Sanscrit, translated by Sir William Jones, 1796.\r\n\r\n   [3] Menu, Inst. c. i. 66, and 67.\r\n\r\n   [4] Herodot.

The meaning of\r\n        this last verse is somewhat obscure; but, taken with the context,\r\n        may be supposed to allude to the abrading power of floods,\r\n        torrents, and rivers.\r\n\r\n   [15] The impregnation from new mineral springs, caused by\r\n        earthquakes in volcanic countries, is perhaps here alluded to.\r\n\r\n   [16] That is probably an allusion to the escape of inflammable\r\n        gas, like that in the district of Baku, west of the Caspian; at\r\n        Pietramala, in the Tuscan Apennines; and several other places.\r\n\r\n   [17] Many of those described seem fanciful fictions, like the\r\n        virtue still so commonly attributed to mineral waters.\r\n\r\n   [18] Raspe, in a learned and judicious essay (De Novis Insulis,\r\n        cap. 19), has made it appear extremely probable that all the\r\n        traditions of certain islands in the Mediterranean having at some\r\n        former time frequently shifted their positions, and at length\r\n        become stationary, originated in the great change produced in\r\n        their form by earthquakes and submarine eruptions, of which there\r\n        have been modern examples in the new islands raised in the time\r\n        of history. When the series of convulsions ended, the island was\r\n        said to become fixed.\r\n\r\n   [19] It is not inconsistent with the Hindoo mythology to suppose\r\n        that Pythagoras might have found in the East not only the system\r\n        of universal and violent catastrophes and periods of repose in\r\n        endless succession, but also that of periodical revolutions,\r\n        effected by the continued agency of ordinary causes. For Brahma,\r\n        Vishnu, and Siva, the first, second, and third persons of the\r\n        Hindoo triad, severally represented the Creative, the Preserving,\r\n        and the Destroying powers of the Deity. The coexistence of these\r\n        three attributes, all in simultaneous operation, might well\r\n        accord with the notion of perpetual but partial alterations\r\n        finally bringing about a complete change. But the fiction\r\n        expressed in the verses before quoted from Menu of eternal\r\n        vicissitudes in the vigils and slumbers of Brahma seems\r\n        accommodated to the system of great general catastrophes followed\r\n        by new creations and periods of repose.\r\n\r\n   [20] Meteor. lib. i. cap. 12.\r\n\r\n   [21] De Die Nat.\r\n\r\n   [22] Lib. ii. cap. 14, 15, and 16.\r\n\r\n   [23] Lib. ii. cap. 14, 15, and 16.\r\n\r\n   [24] Omne ex integro animal generabitur, dabiturque terris homo\r\n        inscius scelerum.--Quaest.

The opinions of each of these sects were taken up by\r\n        different caliphs in succession, and the followers of each\r\n        sometimes submitted to be beheaded, or flogged till at the point\r\n        of death, rather than renounce their creed.--Mod.

Hooke explained with\r\n        considerable clearness the different modes wherein organic\r\n        substances may become lapidified; and, among other illustrations,\r\n        he mentions some silicified palm-wood brought from Africa, on\r\n        which M. de la Hire had read a memoir to the Royal Academy of\r\n        France (June, 1692), wherein he had pointed out, not only the\r\n        tubes running the length of the trunk, but the roots at one\r\n        extremity. De la Hire, says Hooke, also treated of certain trees\r\n        found petrified in the \"river that passes by Bakan, in the\r\n        kingdom of _Ava_, and which has for the space of ten leagues the\r\n        virtue of petrifying wood.\" It is an interesting fact that the\r\n        silicified wood of the Irawadi should have attracted attention\r\n        more than one hundred years ago.

I was, however, assured in the\r\n        same year, by Professor Scarpellini, at Rome, that Pius VII., a\r\n        pontiff distinguished for his love of science, had procured a\r\n        repeal of the edicts against Galileo and the Copernican system.\r\n        He had assembled the Congregation; and the late Cardinal\r\n        Toriozzi, assessor of the Sacred Office, proposed that they\r\n        should wipe off this scandal from the church.\" The repeal was\r\n        carried, with the dissentient voice of one Dominican only. Long\r\n        before that time the Newtonian theory had been taught in the\r\n        Sapienza, and all Catholic universities in Europe (with the\r\n        exception, I am told, of Salamanca); but it was always required\r\n        of professors, in deference to the decrees of the church, to\r\n        use the term _hypothesis_, instead of theory.

In short, he is of opinion, that the\r\n        structure of its teeth, as well as the nature of its epidermis\r\n        and coverings, may have made it \"a meet companion for the\r\n        reindeer.\"\r\n\r\n  [139] Pallas, Reise in Russ.

But this variety must be exceedingly rare; for Mr. Royle\r\n        (late superintendent of the East India Company's Botanic Garden\r\n        at Saharunpore) has assured me, that being in India when Heber's\r\n        Journal appeared, and having never seen or heard of such\r\n        elephants, he made the strictest inquiries respecting the fact,\r\n        and was never able to obtain any evidence in corroboration. Mr.\r\n        Royle resided at Saharunpore, lat. 30 degrees N., upon _the\r\n        extreme northern limits_ of the range of the elephant. Mr.\r\n        Everest also declares that he has been equally unsuccessful in\r\n        finding any one aware of the existence of such a variety or\r\n        breed of the animal, though one solitary individual was\r\n        mentioned to him as having been seen at Delhi, with a good deal\r\n        of long hair upon it. The greatest elevation, says Mr. E., at\r\n        which the wild elephant is found in the mountains to the north\r\n        of Bengal, is at a place called Nahun, about 4000 feet above the\r\n        level of the sea, and in the 31st degree of N. lat., where the\r\n        mean yearly temperature may be about 64 degrees Fahrenheit, and\r\n        the difference between winter and summer very great, equal to\r\n        about 36 degrees F., the month of January averaging 45 degrees,\r\n        and June, the hottest month, 81 degrees F.

Soc., London, No. 6, p. 88. 1846.\r\n\r\n  [156] The Calamites were formerly regarded by Adolphe\r\n        Brongniart as belonging to the tribe of Equisetaceae; but he is\r\n        now inclined to refer them to the class of gymnogens, or\r\n        gymnospermous exogens, which includes the Coniferae and Cycadeae.\r\n        Lepidodendron appears to have been either a gigantic form of\r\n        the lycopodium tribe, or, as Dr. Lindley thinks, intermediate\r\n        between the lycopodia and the fir tribe. The Sigillariae were\r\n        formerly supposed by Ad. Brongniart, to be arborescent ferns;\r\n        but the discovery of their internal structure, and of their\r\n        leaves, has since proved that they have no real affinity to\r\n        ferns. According to the view now taken of their structure,\r\n        their nearest allies in the recent world are the genera Cycas\r\n        and Zamia; while Corda, on the other hand, maintains that they\r\n        were closely related to the succulent euphorbias. Stigmaria is\r\n        now generally admitted to have been merely the root of\r\n        sigillaria. The scalariform vessels of these two genera are not\r\n        conclusive in proving them to have a real affinity with ferns,\r\n        as Mr. Brown has discovered the same structure of vessels in\r\n        Myzodendron, a genus allied to the mistletoe; and Corda has\r\n        lately shown that in two species of Stigmaria, hardly\r\n        distinguishable by external characters, the vessels of the one\r\n        are scalariform, and of the other dotted.\r\n\r\n  [157] Mr. Lindley endeavored formerly (1834) to show, in the\r\n        \"Fossil Flora,\" that Trigonocarpum Noeggerathii, a fruit found\r\n        in the coal measures, has the true structure of a palm-fruit;\r\n        but Ad. Brongniart has since inclined to regard it as\r\n        cycadeous; nor is the French botanist satisfied that some\r\n        specimens of supposed palm wood from the coal-mines of Radnitz\r\n        in Bohemia, described by Corda, really belong to palms. On the\r\n        other hand, Corda has proved Flabellaria borassifolia of\r\n        Sternberg to be an exogenous plant, and Brongniart contends\r\n        that it was allied to the Cycadeae.

Mr. Konig informs\r\n        me that he no longer believes any of these fossils to be tree\r\n        ferns, as he at first stated, but that they agree generically\r\n        with plants in our English coal-beds.

It was referred to by Sir John F. W. Herschel in his\r\n        Discourse on Natural Philosophy, published in 1830. In\r\n        preceding works the gradual diminution of the earth's central\r\n        heat was almost the only cause assigned for the acknowledged\r\n        diminution of the superficial temperature of our planet.\r\n\r\n  [166] We are indebted to Baron Alex. von Humboldt for having\r\n        first collected together the scattered data on which he founded\r\n        an approximation to a true theory of the distribution of heat\r\n        over the globe. Many of these data were derived from the\r\n        author's own observations, and many from the works of M. Pierre\r\n        Prevost, of Genera, on the radiation of heat, and from other\r\n        writers.--See Humboldt on Isothermal Lines, Mamoires d'Arcueil,\r\n        tom. iii. translated in the Edin.

The surface of the latter contains about\r\n        2,793,000 square geographical miles.

Laplace, endeavoring to estimate\r\n        the probable depth of the sea from some of the phenomena of the\r\n        tides, says of the ocean generally, \"que sa profondeur moyenne\r\n        est du meme ordre que la hauteur moyenne des continens et des\r\n        isles au-dessus de son niveau, hauteur qui ne surpasse pas\r\n        mille metres (3280 ft.)\" Mec. Caleste, tom. xi. et Syst. du\r\n        Monde, p. 254. The expression \"du meme ordre\" admits in\r\n        mathematical language of considerable latitude of\r\n        signification, and does not mean that the depth of the water\r\n        below the level of the sea corresponds exactly to the height of\r\n        the land above it.\r\n\r\n        It appeared from the observations of Sir James Ross,\r\n        communicated to me in 1849, by himself, and his fellow voyager,\r\n        Dr. Joseph Hooker, that in latitude 15 degrees 3 minutes S.,\r\n        longitude 23 degrees 14 minutes W. (the island of Trinidad, the\r\n        nearest land, being 486 miles distant, and bearing S. 47 W.),\r\n        they sounded with a weight of 76 lbs., and 4600 fathoms of line,\r\n        which ran out to the very end, without finding bottom. Here\r\n        therefore in mid-ocean the depth exceeded 27,600 feet. One of\r\n        the shallowest soundings ever obtained in the open sea during\r\n        the same survey, struck bottom with 2677 fathoms, or 16,062\r\n        feet, latitude 33 degrees 21 minutes S., longitude 9 degrees 4\r\n        minutes E. The surveyors arrived at the conclusion, that at a\r\n        moderate distance from the shore, the depth of the great ocean\r\n        always exceeds 4000 feet.\r\n\r\n        During the American survey in 1849, a much greater depth, or\r\n        5700 fathoms (34,200 feet), was sounded in the Atlantic by\r\n        Lieut. Walsh, without reaching the bottom, in lat. 31 degrees 59\r\n        minutes N., long. 58 degrees 43 minutes W., or between the\r\n        Bermudas and the Azores. But the deepest soundings yet published\r\n        were taken Oct. 30th 1852, by Capt. Henry M. Denham, R. N., who\r\n        reached bottom at 7706 fathoms (46,236 feet), lat. 36 degrees 49\r\n        minutes S., long. 37 degrees 6 minutes W., the nearest land\r\n        being at the mouth of the River Plate. A weight of 9 lbs. was\r\n        attached to the line, which was one-tenth of an inch in\r\n        diameter; the day was calm, and the line took 9 hours 24 minutes\r\n        to run out. When the bottom was struck the line was raised 50\r\n        fathoms, and then allowed to run out again. It struck at the\r\n        same point as before, verifying the observations. Nevertheless\r\n        some experienced surveyors have remarked that the experiment\r\n        would have been more satisfactory had the weight been greater.\r\n        The highest summits of the Himalaya are about 28,000 feet; the\r\n        Pacific, according to this sounding, is probably at some points\r\n        twice as deep as the Himalaya are high.\r\n\r\n  [186] Mr. Hopkins, reasoning on data furnished by Dove's\r\n        Isothermal maps, has arrived at the very interesting\r\n        conclusion, that both on Snowdon and the lower mountains of the\r\n        West of Ireland the snow-line would descend to within 1000 feet\r\n        of the sea level, and glaciers reach the sea, if we could\r\n        simply assume the three following geographical changes:--\r\n\r\n        1st, The diversion of the Gulf stream from its present\r\n        northerly course; 2dly, the depression of the existing land of\r\n        Northern and Western Europe, to the amount of no more than 500\r\n        feet; and 3dly, a cold current from the North sweeping over the\r\n        submerged area.

Crawfurd, Esq.\r\n\r\n  [189] In speaking of the circulation of air and water in this\r\n        chapter, no allusion is made to the trade winds, or to\r\n        irregularities in the direction of currents, caused by the\r\n        rotary motion of the earth. These causes prevent the movements\r\n        from being direct from north to south, or from south to north,\r\n        but they do not affect the theory of a constant circulation.\r\n\r\n  [190] See Scoreby's Arctic Regions, vol. i. p. 378.\r\n\r\n  [191] Ibid. p. 320.\r\n\r\n  [192] This is shown by projecting a map on the horizon of\r\n        London, that is to say, by supposing the eye of the observer to\r\n        be placed above that city, and to see from thence one half of\r\n        the globe. For it so happens that from that point, and no\r\n        other, we should behold the greatest possible quantity of land;\r\n        and if we are then transferred to the opposite or antipodal\r\n        point, we should see the greatest possible quantity of water.\r\n        (See figs. 3 and 4.) A singular fact, first pointed out by Mr.\r\n        James Gardner, namely, that only one twenty-seventh part of the\r\n        dry land has any land opposite to it, is intimately connected\r\n        with this excess of land in one of the two hemispheres above\r\n        alluded to. Thus, in fig. 3, the land shaded black in part of\r\n        China answers to that portion of the extremity of South America\r\n        and Tierra del Fuego which is opposite or antipodal to it,\r\n        whilst the dark spots in the northern and central parts of\r\n        South America represent Borneo, Sumatra, and other antipodal\r\n        islands in the Eastern Archipelago.

The number of square miles on the surface of the\r\n        globe are 148,522,000, the part occupied by the sea being\r\n        110,849,000, and that by land, 37,673,000; so that the land is\r\n        very nearly to the sea as 1 part in 4. I am informed by Mr.\r\n        Gardner that, according to a rough approximation, the land\r\n        between the 30 degrees N. lat. and the pole occupies a space\r\n        _about equal to that of the sea_, and the land between the 30\r\n        degrees S. lat. and the antarctic circle about one-sixteenth of\r\n        that zone.\r\n\r\n  [204] See papers by Mr. Smith of Jordanhill, F.

Nat. Avril, 1825. The fossil\r\n        is a lower jaw, adhering by its inner side to the slab of\r\n        oolite, in which it is sunk. The form of the condyle, or\r\n        posterior process of the jaw, is convex, agreeing with the\r\n        mammiferous type, and is distinctly seen, an impression of it\r\n        being left on the stone, although in this specimen the bone is\r\n        wanting. The anterior part of the jaw has been partially broken\r\n        away, so that the double fangs of the molar teeth are seen\r\n        fixed in their sockets, the form of the fangs being\r\n        characteristic of the mammalia. Ten molars are preserved, and\r\n        the place of an eleventh is believed to be apparent. The enamel\r\n        of some of the teeth is well preserved.\r\n\r\n  [219] A colored figure of this small and elegant quadruped is\r\n        given in the Trans. Zool. Soc. vol. ii. pl. 28. It is\r\n        insectivorous, and was taken in a hollow tree, in a country\r\n        abounding in ant-hills, ninety miles to the southeast of the\r\n        mouth of Swan River in Australia.--It is the first living\r\n        marsupial species known to have nine molar teeth in the lower\r\n        jaw, and some of the teeth are widely separated from others,\r\n        one of the peculiarities in the thylacotherium of Stonesfield,\r\n        which at first induced M. Blainville to refer that creature to\r\n        the class of reptiles.\r\n\r\n  [220] This figure (No. 10) was taken from the original,\r\n        formerly in Mr. Broderip's collection, and now in the British\r\n        Museum. It consists of the right half of a lower jaw, of which\r\n        the inner side is seen. The jaw contains seven molar teeth, one\r\n        canine, and three incisors; but the end of the jaw is\r\n        fractured, and traces of the alveolus of a fourth incisor are\r\n        seen. With this addition, the number of teeth would agree\r\n        exactly with those of a lower jaw of a didelphis. The fossil is\r\n        well preserved in a slab of oolitic structure containing shells\r\n        of trigoniae and other marine remains. Two or three other\r\n        similar jaws, besides those above represented, have been\r\n        procured from the quarries of Stonesfield.--See Broderip, Zool.\r\n        Journ. vol. ii. p. 408.

Cantley and Dr. Falconer. These were imbedded, like the\r\n        former, in tertiary strata of conglomerate, sand, marl, and clay,\r\n        in the Sub-Himalayan Mountains. (Ibid. vol. v. p. 379. Nov. 1836;\r\n        and vol. vi. p. 354.

Lartet in the\r\n        beginning of 1837, and determined by M. de Blainville. It\r\n        occurred near Auch, in the department of Gers, about forty miles\r\n        west of Toulouse, in freshwater marl, limestone, and sand. They\r\n        were accompanied by the remains of the mastodon, dinotherium,\r\n        palaeotherium, rhinoceros, gigantic sloth, and other extinct\r\n        quadrupeds. (Bulletin de la Soc.

In 1811, MM. Engelhardt and Parrot\r\n        attempted to determine the exact amount of difference by a series\r\n        of levellings and barometrical measurements across the isthmus at\r\n        two different places near the foot of Mount Caucasus. The result\r\n        of their operations led them to the opinion that the Caspian was\r\n        more than 300 feet below the Black Sea. But the correctness of\r\n        the observations having afterwards been called in question, M.\r\n        Parrot revisited the ground in 1829 and 1830, and inferred from\r\n        new levellings, that the mouth of the Don was between three and\r\n        four feet lower than that of the Wolga; in other words, that the\r\n        sea of Azof, which communicates with the Black Sea, was actually\r\n        lower than the Caspian! Other statements, no less contradictory,\r\n        having been made by other observers, the Russian government at\r\n        length directed the Academy of St. Petersburg to send an\r\n        expedition, in 1836, to decide the point by a trigonometrical\r\n        survey, from which it appeared that the Caspian is 101 Russian,\r\n        or 108 English, feet lower than the Black Sea. (For authorities,\r\n        see Journ. Roy. Geograph. Soc. vol. viii. p. 135). Sir R.\r\n        Murchison, however, concludes, in 1845, from the best Russian\r\n        authorities, that the depression of the Caspian is only 83 feet 6\r\n        inches.\r\n\r\n        The measurements of Major Anthony Symonds, since confirmed by\r\n        French authorities, make the Dead Sea to be 1200 feet below the\r\n        Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n  [238] See Lyell's Travels in N.

The conchological evidence respecting the\r\n        British Miocene, Pliocene, and Pleistocene fossils, examined by\r\n        Mr. Forbes, in the paper before cited, p. 88, note, bear out some\r\n        of the most important conclusions of M.

I refer to these authorities more\r\n        especially because this doctrine of a gradual transition has been\r\n        opposed by some living naturalists of high distinction, among\r\n        whom I may mention M.A. d'Orbigny and M.

If the\r\n        steam-vessel happen to run against a snag, and that a hole is\r\n        made in her bow, under the surface, this chamber merely fills\r\n        with water.\"--Travels in North America, vol. iii. p. 363.\r\n\r\n  [362] Darby's Louisiana, p. 33.\r\n\r\n  [363] Featherstonhaugh, Geol. Report, Washington, 1835, p. 84.\r\n\r\n  [364] Trees submerged in an upright position have been observed\r\n        in other parts of N. America. Thus Captains Clark and Lewis\r\n        found, about the year 1807, a forest of pines standing erect\r\n        under water in the body of the Columbia river, which they\r\n        supposed, from the appearance of the trees, to have been\r\n        submerged only about twenty years. (Travels, &c. vol. ii. p.\r\n        241.) More lately (1835), the Rev. Mr. Parker observed on the\r\n        same river (lat. 45 degrees N., long. 121 degrees W.) trees\r\n        standing in their natural position in spots where the water was\r\n        more than twenty feet deep. The tops of the trees had\r\n        disappeared; but between high and low water-mark the trunks were\r\n        only partially decayed; and the roots were seen through the\r\n        clear water, spreading as they had grown in their native forest.\r\n        (Tour beyond the Rocky Mountains, p. 132.) Some have inferred\r\n        from these facts that a tract of land, more than twenty miles in\r\n        length, must have subsided vertically; but Capt. Fremont, Dec.\r\n        1845 (Rep. of Explor. Exped. p. 195), satisfied himself that the\r\n        submerged forests have been formed by immense land-slides from\r\n        the mountains, which here closely shut in the river.\r\n\r\n  [365] For an account of the \"sunk country,\" shaken by the\r\n        earthquake of 1811-12, see Lyell's Second Visit to the United\r\n        States, ch. 33.\r\n\r\n  [366] Darby's Louisiana, p. 103.\r\n\r\n  [367] The calculations here given were communicated to the\r\n        British Association, in a lecture which I delivered at\r\n        Southampton in September, 1846. (See Athenaeum Journal, Sept.\r\n        26, 1846, and Report of British Association, 1846, p. 117.)\r\n        Dr. Riddell has since repeated his experiments on the quantity\r\n        of sediment in the river at New Orleans without any material\r\n        variation in the results.\r\n\r\n        Mr. Forshey, in a memoir on the Physics of the Mississippi,\r\n        published in 1850, adopts Dr. Riddell's estimate for the\r\n        quantity of mud, but takes 447,199 cubic feet per second as\r\n        the average discharge of water for the year at Carrolton, nine\r\n        miles above New Orleans, a result deduced from thirty years of\r\n        observations. This being one-tenth more than I had assumed,\r\n        would add a tenth to the sediment, and would diminish by\r\n        one-eleventh the number of years required to accomplish the\r\n        task above alluded to. \"The cubic contents of sedimentary\r\n        matter,\" says Forshey, \"are equal to 4,083,333,333, and this\r\n        sediment would annually cover twelve miles square one foot\r\n        deep.\"\r\n\r\n  [368] The Mississippi is continually shifting its course in\r\n        the great alluvial plain, cutting frequently to the depth of\r\n        100, and even sometimes to the depth of 250 feet. As the old\r\n        channels become afterwards filled up, or in a great degree\r\n        obliterated, this excavation alone must have given a\r\n        considerable depth to the basin, which receives the alluvial\r\n        deposit, and subsidences like those accompanying the\r\n        earthquake of New Madrid in 1811-12 may have given still more\r\n        depth.\r\n\r\n  [369] Account of the Ganges and Burrampooter rivers, by Major\r\n        Rennell, Phil.

But I learn from Dr. Falconer\r\n        that there are three well-marked species, _C. biporcatus_, _C.\r\n        palustris_, and _C. bombifrons_. _C. bombifrons_ occurs in the\r\n        northern branches of the Ganges, 1000 miles from Calcutta; _C.\r\n        biporcatus_ appears to be confined to the estuary; and _C.\r\n        palustris_, to range from the estuary to the central parts of\r\n        Bengal. The garial is found along with _C. bombifrons_ in the\r\n        north, and descends to the region of _C. biporcatus_ in the\r\n        estuary.\r\n\r\n  [372] See below, ch. 22 and 29.\r\n\r\n  [373] Second Visit to the United States, vol. ii. p. 145.\r\n\r\n  [374] Asiatic Researches, vol. xvii. p. 466.\r\n\r\n  [375] Lyell's Second Visit to the United States, vol. ii.\r\n        chap. 34.\r\n\r\n  [376] See Manual of Geology by the Author.\r\n\r\n  [377] See p. 13.\r\n\r\n  [378] Geog. of Herod, vol ii. p. 331.\r\n\r\n  [379] Ibid. p. 328.\r\n\r\n  [380] Romme, Vents et Courans, vol. ii. p. 2.

In regard to marine infusoria found\r\n        in volcanic tuff; it is well known that on the shores of the\r\n        island of Cephalonia in the Mediterranean (Proceedings, Geol.\r\n        Soc. vol. ii. p. 220), there is a cavity in the rock, into\r\n        which the sea has been flowing for ages, and many others\r\n        doubtless exist in the leaky bottom of the ocean. The marine\r\n        current has been rushing in for many years, and as the\r\n        infusoria inhabiting the waters of the Mediterranean are\r\n        exceedingly abundant, a vast store of their cases may\r\n        accumulate in submarine caverns (the water, perhaps, being\r\n        converted into steam, and so escaping upwards), and they may\r\n        then be cast up again to furnish the materials of volcanic\r\n        tuff, should an eruption occur like that which produced Graham\r\n        Island, off the coast of Sicily, in 1831.\r\n\r\n  [554] Hamilton, Observ. on Mount Vesuvius, p. 94.

The Catanians,\r\n        disappointed that their mountain had lost nearly 2000 feet of\r\n        the height assigned to it by Recupero, refused to acquiesce in\r\n        the decision. Afterwards, in 1824, Sir J. Herschel, not being\r\n        aware of Captain Smyth's conclusions, determined by careful\r\n        barometrical measurement that the height was 10,872-1/2 feet.\r\n        This singular agreement of results so differently obtained was\r\n        spoken of by Herschel as \"a happy accident;\" but Dr. Wollaston\r\n        remarked that \"it was one of those accidents which would not\r\n        have happened to two fools.\"\r\n\r\n  [561] Book iii. at the end.\r\n\r\n  [562] The hill which I have here introduced was called by my\r\n        guide Vampolara, but the name given in the text is the nearest\r\n        to this which I find in Gemmellaro's Catalogue of Minor Cones.\r\n\r\n  [563] Mam. pour servir, &c. tom. iv. p. 116.\r\n\r\n  [564] See Prof. J.

The\r\n        small cone, and the crater nearest the foreground, were among\r\n        those formed during the eruptions of 1810 and 1811.\r\n\r\n  [570] Scrope on Volcanoes, p. 102.\r\n\r\n  [571] Ferara, Descriz. dell' Etna, p. 116.\r\n\r\n  [572] Mr. Nasmyth, the inventor of the steam-hammer, has\r\n        lately illustrated, by a very striking experiment, the\r\n        non-conductibility of a thin layer of dry sand and clay. Into\r\n        a caldron of iron one-fourth of an inch thick, lined with sand\r\n        and clay five-eighths of an inch thick, he poured eight tons\r\n        of melted iron at a white heat. After the fused metal had been\r\n        twenty minutes in the caldron the palm of the hand could be\r\n        applied to the outside without inconvenience, and after forty\r\n        minutes there was not heat enough to singe writing-paper. This\r\n        fact may help us to explain how strata in contact with dikes,\r\n        or beds of fused matter, have sometimes escaped without\r\n        perceptible alteration by heat.\r\n\r\n  [573] Journ. of Roy.

Henderson was enabled to correct some of the\r\n        measurements given by Stephenson, of the depth, width, and\r\n        length of the lava currents, by reference to the MS. of Mr.\r\n        Paulson, who visited the tract in 1794, and examined the lava\r\n        with attention. (Journal of a Residence in Iceland, &c. p.\r\n        229.)

Senhouse, R. N., the first who succeeded in\r\n        landing on it. The seven rival names are Nerita, Ferdinanda,\r\n        Hotham, Graham, Corrao, Sciacca, Julia. As the isle was\r\n        visible for only about three months, this is an instance of a\r\n        wanton multiplication of synonyms which has scarcely ever been\r\n        outdone even in the annals of zoology and botany.\r\n\r\n  [594] Phil.

The late Von Hoff published from time to time, in\r\n        Poggendorf's Annalen, lists of earthquakes which happened\r\n        between 1821 and 1836; and, by consulting these, the reader\r\n        will perceive that every month is signalized by one or many\r\n        convulsions in some part of the globe.

Feb. 1830.\r\n\r\n  [753] The heat was measured in Wedgwood's pyrometer by the\r\n        contraction of pure clay, which is reduced in volume when\r\n        heated, first by the loss of its water of combination, and\r\n        afterwards, on the application of more intense heat, by\r\n        incipient vitrification. The expansion of platina is the test\r\n        employed by Mr. Daniell in his pyrometer, and this has been\r\n        found to yield uniform and constant results, such as are in\r\n        perfect harmony with conclusions drawn from various other\r\n        independent sources. The instrument for which the author\r\n        received the Rumford Medal from the Royal Society, in 1833, is\r\n        described in the Phil. Trans. 1830, part ii., and 1831, part\r\n        ii.\r\n\r\n  [754] The above remarks are reprinted verbatim from my third\r\n        edition, May, 1834. A memoir was afterwards communicated by M.\r\n        Poisson to the Academy of Sciences, January, 1837, on the\r\n        solid parts of the globe, containing an epitome of a work\r\n        entitled \"Thaorie Mathamatique de la Chaleur,\" published in\r\n        1835. In this memoir he controverts the doctrine of the high\r\n        temperature of a central fluid on similar grounds to those\r\n        above stated. He imagines, that if the globe ever passed from\r\n        a liquid to a solid state by radiation of heat, the central\r\n        nucleus must have begun to cool and consolidate first.\r\n\r\n  [755] Consolations in Travel, p. 271.\r\n\r\n  [756] Phil.

The presence of an\r\n        occasional grain of Indian corn or maize in several of the\r\n        parcels of grain shown to my friend as coming from the\r\n        catacombs confirmed his scepticism.\r\n\r\n  [810] Phil.

They had been packed up\r\n        in a box, and enveloped in cotton: two for a space of\r\n        thirteen, one for seventeen, and a fourth for upwards of\r\n        twenty months: but, on being exposed by Mr. Broderip to the\r\n        warmth of a fire in London, and provided with tepid water and\r\n        leaves, they revived, and lived for several months in Mr.\r\n        Loddiges' palm-house, till accidentally drowned.\r\n\r\n  [919] Camb.

It was I believe the first attempt to point out\r\n        how former changes in the geography and local climate of many\r\n        parts of the globe must be taken into account when we endeavor\r\n        to explain the actual provinces of plants and animals, the\r\n        changes alluded to having been proved by geological evidence\r\n        to be subsequent to the creation of a great proportion of the\r\n        species now living, and these having been, according to the\r\n        view which I advocated, introduced in succession, and not all\r\n        at one geological epoch. In my third volume, published in May,\r\n        1833, I announced my conviction that the greater part of the\r\n        existing Fauna and Flora of Sicily were older than the\r\n        mountains, plains, and rivers, which the same species of\r\n        animals and plants now inhabit. (Prin. of Geol., vol. iii. ch.\r\n        ix.; repeated in Elements of Geol., 2d edit., vol. i. p. 297.)\r\n        This line of reasoning has since been ably followed up and\r\n        elucidated by Professor E. Forbes in an excellent paper\r\n        (published in 1846) already alluded to. (See page 86.)\r\n\r\n  [991] Essai Elamentaire, &c. p. 46.\r\n\r\n  [992] Geog. des Plantes.

They are hollow; and for this reason resemble, at first\r\n        sight, the bones of birds rather than of reptiles; for the\r\n        latter have no medullary cavity. Prof. Owen, of the College of\r\n        Surgeons, in order to elucidate this point, dissected for me a\r\n        very young turtle, and found that the exterior portion only of\r\n        the bones was ossified, the interior being still filled with\r\n        cartilage. This cartilage soon dried up and shrank to a mere\r\n        thread upon the evaporation of the spirits of wine in which\r\n        the specimen had been preserved, so that in a short time the\r\n        bones became as empty as those of birds.\r\n\r\n [1111] Ehrenberg, Nat. und Bild. der Coralleninseln. &c.,\r\n        Berlin, 1834.\r\n\r\n [1112] See Ehrenberg's work above cited, p. 751.\r\n\r\n [1113] Stutchbury, West of England Journal, No. i. p. 49.\r\n\r\n [1114] Darwin's Coral Reefs, p. 77.\r\n\r\n [1115] Ibid. 78.\r\n\r\n [1116] Voyage to the Pacific, &c. in 1825-28.\r\n\r\n [1117] Darwin's Journal, &c., p. 540, and new edit., of 1845,\r\n        p. 453.\r\n\r\n [1118] Darwin's Journal, &c., pp. 547, 548., and 2d edit., of\r\n        1845, p. 460.\r\n\r\n [1119] Kotzebue's Voy., 1815-18, vol. iii. pp. 331-333.\r\n\r\n [1120] Stutchbury, West of Eng.

The Acephala are that division of molluscous animals\r\n    which, like the oyster and scallop, are without heads. The class\r\n    Acephala of Cuvier comprehends many genera of animals with bivalve\r\n    shells, and a few which are devoid of shells. _Etym._, [Greek: a],\r\n    _a_, without, and [Greek: kephale], _cephale_, the head.\r\n\r\n  ACIDULOUS. Slightly acid.\r\n\r\n  ACROGENS. One of five classes into which all plants may be divided;\r\n    it includes such flowerless ones as grow from the top only, and\r\n    whose stems consequently do not increase materially in bulk, as\r\n    Mosses, Ferns, Lycopodiums, Equisetums, &c. The trunk of a tree fern\r\n    is a good example. They are also called Acrobrya. _Etym._, [Greek:\r\n    akron], _acron_, the top, and [Greek: genesis], _genesis_, increase.\r\n\r\n  ADIPOCIRE. A substance apparently intermediate between fat and wax,\r\n    into which dead animal matter is converted when buried in the earth,\r\n    and in a certain stage of decomposition. _Etym._, _adeps_, fat, and\r\n    _cera_, wax.\r\n\r\n  ALBITE. See \"Felspar.\"\r\n\r\n  ALEMBIO. An apparatus for distilling.\r\n\r\n  ALGAE. An order or division of the cryptogamic class of plants. The\r\n    whole of the sea-weeds are comprehended under this division, and the\r\n    application of the term in this work is to marine plants. _Etym._,\r\n    _alga_, sea-weed.\r\n\r\n  ALLUVIAL. The adjective of alluvium, which see.\r\n\r\n  ALLUVION. Synonymous with alluvium, which see.\r\n\r\n  ALLUVIUM. Earth, sand, gravel, stones, and other transported matter\r\n    which has been washed away and thrown down by rivers, floods, or\r\n    other causes upon land not _permanently_ submerged beneath the\r\n    waters of lakes or seas. _Etym._, _alluo_, to wash upon, or\r\n    _alluvio_, an inundation.\r\n\r\n  ALUM-STONE, ALUMEN, ALUMINOUS. Alum is the base of pure clay, and\r\n    strata of clay are often met with containing much iron pyrites. When\r\n    the latter substance decomposes, sulphuric acid is produced, which\r\n    unites with the aluminous earth of the clay to form sulphate of\r\n    alumine, or common alum. Where manufactories are established for\r\n    obtaining the alum, the indurated beds of clay employed are called\r\n    Alum-stone.\r\n\r\n  AMMONITE. An extinct and very numerous genus of the order of\r\n    molluscous animals called Cephalopoda, allied to the modern genus\r\n    Nautilus, which inhabited a chambered shell, curved like a coiled\r\n    snake. Species of it are found in all geological periods of the\r\n    secondary strata; but they have not been seen in the tertiary beds.\r\n    They are named from their resemblance to the horns on the statues of\r\n    Jupiter Ammon.\r\n\r\n  AMORPHOUS. Bodies devoid of regular form. _Etym._, [Greek: a], _a_,\r\n    without, and [Greek: morphe], _morphe_, form.\r\n\r\n  AMYGDALOID. One of the forms of the Trap-rocks, in which agates and\r\n    simple minerals appear to be scattered like almonds in a cake.\r\n    _Etym._, [Greek: amygdala], _amygdala_, an almond.\r\n\r\n  ANALCIME. A simple mineral of the Zeolite family, also called\r\n    Cubizite, of frequent occurrence in the Trap-rocks.\r\n\r\n  ANALOGUE. A body that resembles or corresponds with another body. A\r\n    recent shell of the same species as a fossil shell is the analogue\r\n    of the latter.\r\n\r\n  ANGOIOSPERMS. A term applied to all flowering plants in which the\r\n    ovules are inclosed in an ovary, and the seeds in a pericarp or\r\n    covering, as in all flowering plants except those mentioned under\r\n    gymnosperms and gymnogens, which see. _Etym._, [Greek: angos],\r\n    _angos_, a vessel, and [Greek: sperma], a seed.\r\n\r\n  ANOPLOTHERIUM. A fossil extinct quadruped belonging to the order\r\n    Pachydermata, resembling a pig. It has received its name because the\r\n    animal must have been singularly wanting in means of defence, from\r\n    the form of its teeth and the absence of claws, hoofs, and horns.\r\n    _Etym._, [Greek: anoplos], _anoplos_, unarmed, and [Greek: therion],\r\n    _therion_, a wild beast.\r\n\r\n  ANTAGONIST POWER. Two powers in nature, the action of the one\r\n    counteracting that of the other, by which a kind of equilibrium or\r\n    balance is maintained, and the destructive effect prevented that\r\n    would be produced by one operating without a check.\r\n\r\n  ANTENNAE. The articulated horns with which the heads of insects are\r\n    invariably furnished.\r\n\r\n  ANTHRACITE. A shining substance like black-lead; a species of\r\n    mineral charcoal. _Etym._, [Greek: anthrax], _anthrax_, coal.\r\n\r\n  ANTHRACOTHERIUM. A name given to an extinct quadruped, supposed to\r\n    belong to the Pachydermata, the bones of which were first found in\r\n    lignite and coal of the tertiary strata. _Etym._, [Greek: anthrax],\r\n    _anthrax_, coal, and [Greek: therion], _therion_, wild beast.\r\n\r\n  ANTHROPOMORPHOUS. Having a form resembling the human. _Etym._,\r\n    [Greek: anthropos], _anthropos_, a man, and [Greek: morphe],\r\n    _morphe_, form.\r\n\r\n  ANTISEPTIC. Substances which prevent corruption in animal and\r\n    vegetable matter, as common salt does, are said to be antiseptic.\r\n    _Etym._, [Greek: anti], _anti_, against, and [Greek: sepo], _sepo_,\r\n    to putrefy.\r\n\r\n  ARENACEOUS. Sandy. _Etym._, _arena_, sand.\r\n\r\n  ARGILLACEOUS. Clayey, composed of clay. _Etym._, _argilla_, clay.\r\n\r\n  ARRAGONITE. A simple mineral, a variety of carbonate of lime, so\r\n    called from having been first found in Aragon in Spain.\r\n\r\n  ATOLLS. Coral islands of an annular form, or consisting of a\r\n    circular strip or ring of coral surrounding a central lagoon.\r\n\r\n  AUGITE. A simple mineral of a dark green, or black color, which\r\n    forms a constituent part of many varieties of volcanic rocks. Name\r\n    applied by Pliny to a particular mineral, from the Greek [Greek:\r\n    auge], _auge_, lustre.\r\n\r\n  AVALANCHES. Masses of snow which, being detached from great heights\r\n    in the Alps, acquire enormous bulk by fresh accumulations as they\r\n    descend; and when they fall into the valleys below often cause great\r\n    destruction. They are also called _lavanges_ and _lavanches_ in the\r\n    dialects of Switzerland.\r\n\r\n  BASALT. One of the most common varieties of the Trap-rocks. It is a\r\n    dark green or black stone, composed of augite and felspar, very\r\n    compact in texture, and of considerable hardness, often found in\r\n    regular pillars of three or more sides called basaltic columns.\r\n    Remarkable examples of this kind are seen at the Giant's Causeway,\r\n    in Ireland, and at Fingal's Cave, in Staffa, one of the Hebrides.\r\n    The term is used by Pliny, and is said to come from _basal_, an\r\n    AEthiopian word signifying iron. The rock often contains much iron.\r\n\r\n \"BASIN\" of Paris, \"BASIN\" of London. Deposits lying in a hollow or\r\n    trough, formed of older rocks; sometimes used in geology almost\r\n    synonymously with \"formations,\" to express the deposits lying in a\r\n    certain cavity or depression in older rocks.\r\n\r\n  BELEMNITE. An extinct genus of the order of molluscous animals\r\n    called Cephalopoda, having a long, straight, and chambered conical\r\n    shell. _Etym._, [Greek: belemnon], _belemnon_, a dart.\r\n\r\n  BITUMEN. Mineral pitch, of which the tar-like substance which is\r\n    often seen to ooze out of the Newcastle coal when on the fire, and\r\n    which makes it cake, is a good example. _Etym._, _bitumen_, pitch.\r\n\r\n  BITUMINOUS SHALE. An argillaceous shale, much impregnated with\r\n    bitumen, which is very common in the Coal Measures.\r\n\r\n  BLENDE. A metallic ore, a compound of the metal zinc with sulphur.\r\n    It is often found in brown shining crystals; hence its name among\r\n    the German miners, from the word _blenden_, to dazzle.\r\n\r\n  BLUFFS. High banks presenting a precipitous front to the sea or a\r\n    river. A term used in the United States of North America.\r\n\r\n  BOTRYOIDAL. Resembling a bunch of Grapes. _Etym._, [Greek: botrys],\r\n    _botrys_, a bunch of grapes, and [Greek: eidos], _eidos_, form.\r\n\r\n  BOULDERS. A provincial term for large rounded blocks of stone lying\r\n    on the surface of the ground, or sometimes imbedded in loose soil,\r\n    different in composition from the rocks in their vicinity, and which\r\n    have been therefore transported from a distance.\r\n\r\n  BRECCIA. A rock composed of angular fragments connected together by\r\n    lime or other mineral substance. An Italian term.\r\n\r\n  CALC SINTER. A German name for the deposits from springs holding\r\n    carbonate of lime in solution--petrifying springs. _Etym._, _kalk_,\r\n    lime, and _sintern_, to drop.\r\n\r\n  CALCAIRE GROSSIER. An extensive stratum, or rather series of strata,\r\n    found in the Paris Basin, belonging to the Eocene tertiary period.\r\n    _Etym._, _calcaire_, limestone, and _grossier_, coarse.\r\n\r\n  CALCAREOUS ROCK. Limestone. _Etym._, _calx_, lime.\r\n\r\n  CALCAREOUS SPAR. Crystallized carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\n  CARBON. An undecomposed inflammable substance, one of the simple\r\n    elementary bodies. Charcoal is almost entirely composed of it.\r\n    _Etym._, _carbo_, coal.\r\n\r\n  CARBONATE OF LIME. Lime combines with great avidity with carbonic\r\n    acid, a gaseous acid only obtained fluid when united with\r\n    water,--and all combinations of it with other substances are called\r\n    _Carbonates_. All limestones are carbonates of lime, and quicklime\r\n    is obtained by driving off the carbonic acid by heat.\r\n\r\n  CARBONATED SPRINGS. Springs of water, containing carbonic acid gas.\r\n    They are very common, especially in volcanic countries; and\r\n    sometimes contain so much gas, that if a little sugar be thrown into\r\n    the water it effervesces like soda-water.\r\n\r\n  CARBONIC ACID GAS. A natural gas which often issues from the ground,\r\n    especially in volcanic countries. _Etym._, _carbo_, coal; because\r\n    the gas is obtained by the slow burning of charcoal.\r\n\r\n  CARBONIFEROUS. A term usually applied, in a technical sense, to an\r\n    ancient group of secondary strata; but any bed containing coal may\r\n    be said to be carboniferous. _Etym._, _carbo_, coal, and _fero_, to\r\n    bear.\r\n\r\n  CATACLYSM. A deluge. _Etym._, [Greek: kataklyzo], _catacluzo_, to\r\n    deluge.\r\n\r\n  CEPHALOPODA. A class of molluscous animals, having their organs of\r\n    motion arranged round their head. _Etym._, [Greek: kephale],\r\n    _cephale_, head, and [Greek: poda], _poda_, feet.\r\n\r\n  CETACEA. An order of vertebrated mammiferous animals inhabiting the\r\n    sea. The whale, dolphin, and narwal are examples. _Etym._, _cete_,\r\n    whale.\r\n\r\n  CHALCEDONY. A siliceous simple mineral, uncrystallized. Agates are\r\n    partly composed of chalcedony.\r\n\r\n  CHALK. A white earthy limestone, the uppermost of the secondary\r\n    series of strata.\r\n\r\n  CHERT. A siliceous mineral, nearly allied to chalcedony and flint,\r\n    but less homogeneous and simple in texture. A gradual passage from\r\n    chert to limestone is not uncommon.\r\n\r\n  CHLORITIC SAND. Sand colored green by an admixture of the simple\r\n    mineral chlorite. _Etym._, [Greek: chlorys], _chlorus_, green.\r\n\r\n  CLEAVAGE. Certain rocks, usually called Slate-rocks, may be cleaved\r\n    into an indefinite number of thin laminae which are parallel to each\r\n    other, but which are generally not parallel to the planes of the\r\n    true strata or layers of deposition. The planes of cleavage,\r\n    therefore, are distinguishable from those of stratification.\r\n\r\n  CLINKSTONE, called also phonolite, a felspathic rock of the trap\r\n    family, usually fissile. It is sonorous when struck with a hammer,\r\n    whence its name.\r\n\r\n  COAL FORMATION. This term is generally understood to mean the same\r\n    as the Coal Measures, or Carboniferous group.\r\n\r\n  COLEOPTERA. An order of insects (Beetles) which have four wings, the\r\n    upper pair being crustaceous and forming a shield. _Etym._, [Greek:\r\n    koleos], _coleos_, a sheath, and [Greek: pteron], _pteron_, a wing.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 98.\r\n\r\n  CONFORMABLE. When the planes of one set of strata are generally\r\n    parallel to those of another set which are in contact, they are said\r\n    to be conformable. Thus the set _a_, _b_, Fig. 98, rest conformably\r\n    on the inferior set _c_, _d_; but _c_, _d_ rest unconformably on E.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONGENERS. Species which belong to the same genus.\r\n\r\n  CONGLOMERATE, or PUDDINGSTONE. Rounded water-worn fragments of rock\r\n    or pebbles, cemented together by another mineral substance, which\r\n    may be of a siliceous, calcareous, or argillaceous nature. _Etym._,\r\n    _con_, together, _glomero_, to heap.\r\n\r\n  CONIFERAE. An order of plants, all of which have disks in their wood\r\n    fibres, by which they are recognized in a fossil state. Their ovules\r\n    are naked (see GYMNOGENS). Most of the northern kinds bear the seeds\r\n    in cones; but the yew does not, nor do a host of tropical and south\r\n    temperate species. _Etym._, _conus_, a cone, and _fero_, to bear.\r\n\r\n  COSMOGONY, COSMOLOGY. Words synonymous in meaning, applied to\r\n    speculations respecting the first origin or mode of creation of the\r\n    earth. _Etym._, [Greek: kosmos], _kosmos_, the world, and [Greek:\r\n    gone], _gonee_, generation, or [Greek: logos], _logos_, discourse.\r\n\r\n  CRAG. A provincial name in Norfolk and Suffolk for certain tertiary\r\n    deposits usually composed of sand with shells, belonging to the\r\n    Older Pliocene period.\r\n\r\n  CRATER. The circular cavity at the summit of a volcano, from which\r\n    the volcanic matter is ejected. _Etym._, _crater_, a great cup or\r\n    bowl.\r\n\r\n  CRETACEOUS. Belonging to chalk. _Etym._, _creta_, chalk.\r\n\r\n  CROP OUT. A miner's or mineral surveyor's term, to express the\r\n    rising up or exposure at the surface of a stratum or series of\r\n    strata.\r\n\r\n  CRUST OF THE EARTH. See \"Earth's crust.\"\r\n\r\n  CRUSTACEOUS. Animals having a shelly coating or crust which they\r\n    cast periodically. Crabs, shrimps, and lobsters are examples.\r\n\r\n  CRYPTOGAMIC. Asexual, flowerless, or Acotyledonous plants; a term\r\n    applied to half the vegetable kingdom in contradistinction to\r\n    Phaenogamic, sexual, or flowering plants. It includes Fungi,\r\n    Sea-weeds, Lichens, Mosses, Ferns, &c., which have no obvious\r\n    flowers, and no cotyledons (seed-lobes) to their spores or seeds.\r\n    _Etym._, [Greek: kryptos], _cruptos_, concealed, and [Greek: gamos],\r\n    _gamos_, marriage.\r\n\r\n  CRYSTALS. Simple minerals are frequently found in regular forms,\r\n    with facets like the drops of cut glass of chandeliers. Quartz being\r\n    often met with in rocks in such forms, and beautifully transparent\r\n    like ice, was called _rock-crystal_, [Greek: krystallos],\r\n    crystallos, being Greek for ice. Hence the regular _forms_ of other\r\n    minerals are called crystals, whether they be clear or opake.\r\n\r\n  CRYSTALLIZED. A mineral which is found in regular forms or crystals\r\n    is said to be crystallized.\r\n\r\n  CRYSTALLINE. The internal texture which regular crystals exhibit\r\n    when broken, or a confused assemblage of ill-defined crystals.\r\n    Loaf-sugar and statuary-marble have a _crystalline_ texture.\r\n    Sugar-candy and calcareous spar are crystallized.\r\n\r\n  CUPRIFEROUS. Copper-bearing. _Etym._, _cuprum_, copper, and _fero_,\r\n    to bear.\r\n\r\n  CYCADEAE. A small and very anomalous order of flowering plants,\r\n    chiefly found in Mexico, the East Indian Islands, South Africa, and\r\n    Australia. They are Gymnogens as to ovules, and neither Exogens nor\r\n    Endogens in the wood of their short, simple, or branched trunks, and\r\n    they have dicotyledonous seeds. The leaves are pinnated (like those\r\n    of cocoa-nut palms), and when young are rolled inwards as in Ferns.\r\n    The wood fibres are curiously perforated, and marked, by which they\r\n    are recognized in a fossil state as well as by the trunk and\r\n    foliage, and the cones, which contain the male flowers. The term is\r\n    derived from [Greek: kykas], _cycas_, a name applied by the ancient\r\n    Greek naturalist Threophrastus to a palm.\r\n\r\n  CYPERACEAE. A tribe of plants answering to the English sedges; they\r\n    are distinguished from grasses by their stems being solid, and\r\n    generally triangular, instead of being hollow and round. Together\r\n    with _Gramineae_, they constitute what writers on botanical geography\r\n    often call _glumaceae_.\r\n\r\n  DEBACLE. A great rush of waters, which, breaking down all opposing\r\n    barriers, carries forward the broken fragments of rocks, and spreads\r\n    them in its course. _Etym._, _dabacler_, French, to unbar, to break\r\n    up as a river does at the cessation of a long-continued frost.\r\n\r\n  DELTA. When a great river, before it enters the sea, divides into\r\n    separate streams, they often diverge and form two sides of a\r\n    triangle, the sea being the base. The land included by the three\r\n    lines, and which is invariably alluvial, was first called, in the\r\n    case of the Nile a delta, from its resemblance to the letter of the\r\n    Greek alphabet which goes by that name [Greek: D]. Geologists\r\n    apply the term to alluvial land formed by a river at its mouth,\r\n    without reference to its precise shape.\r\n\r\n  DENUDATION. The carrying away by the action of running water of a\r\n    portion of the solid materials of the land, by which inferior rocks\r\n    are laid bare. _Etym._, _denudo_, to lay bare.\r\n\r\n  DEOXIDIZED, DEOXIDATED. Deprived of oxygen. Disunited from oxygen.\r\n\r\n  DESICCATION. The art of drying up. _Etym._, _desicco_, to dry up.\r\n\r\n  DETRITUS. Matter worn or rubbed off from rocks. _Etym._, _de_, from,\r\n    and _tero_, to rub.\r\n\r\n  DICOTYLEDONOUS. A grand division of the vegetable kingdom, founded\r\n    on the plant having two _cotyledons_, or seed-lobes. _Etym._,\r\n    [Greek: dis], _dis_, double, and [Greek: kotyledon], _cotyledon_.\r\n\r\n  DIKES. When a mass of the unstratified or igneous rocks, such as\r\n    granite, trap, and lava, appears as if injected into a rent in the\r\n    stratified rocks, cutting across the strata, it forms a dike. They\r\n    are sometimes seen running along the ground, and projecting, like a\r\n    wall, from the softer strata on both sides of them having wasted\r\n    away; whence they were first called in the north of England and in\r\n    Scotland _dikes_, a provincial name for wall. It is not easy to draw\r\n    the line between dikes and veins. The former are generally of larger\r\n    dimensions, and have their sides parallel for considerable\r\n    distances; while veins have generally many ramifications, and these\r\n    often thin away into slender threads.\r\n\r\n  DILUVIUM. Those accumulations of gravel and loose materials, which,\r\n    by some geologists, are said to have been produced by the action of\r\n    a diluvian wave or deluge sweeping over the surface of the earth.\r\n    _Etym._, _diluvium_, deluge.\r\n\r\n  DIP. When a stratum does not lie horizontally, but is inclined, it\r\n    is said to dip towards some point of the compass, and the angle it\r\n    makes with the horizon is called the angle of dip or inclination.\r\n\r\n  DIPTERA.

A class of flowering plants, whose stems present no\r\n    distinction of wood, pith, and bark. The wood is disposed in\r\n    bundles, placed nearer the axis than those of the previous year, as\r\n    in palm trunks. This class answers to the Monocotyledones of\r\n    Jussieu. _Etym._, [Greek: endon], _endon_, within, and [Greek:\r\n    genesis], _genesis_, increase.\r\n\r\n  ENTOMOSTRACA. Cuvier's second section of Crustacea; so called from\r\n    their relationship to insects. _Etym._, [Greek: entoma], _entoma_,\r\n    insects.\r\n\r\n  EOCENE. A name given to the lowest division of the tertiary strata,\r\n    containing an extremely small percentage of living species amongst\r\n    its fossil shells, which indicate the first commencement or dawn of\r\n    the existing state of the animate creation. _Etym._, [Greek: eos],\r\n    _eos_, aurora or the dawn, and [Greek: kainos], _kainos_, recent.\r\n\r\n  ESCARPMENT.

This class answers to the\r\n    Dicotyledones of Jussieu, and includes all common English trees\r\n    except pines, &c. (See GYMNOGENS.) _Etym._, [Greek: exo], _exo_,\r\n    outside, [Greek: genesis], _genesis_, increase.\r\n\r\n  EXPERIMENTUM CRUCIS. A decisive experiment, so called, because, like\r\n    a cross or direction-post, it directs men to true knowledge; or, as\r\n    some explain it, because it is a kind of torture whereby the nature\r\n    of the thing is extorted, as it were, by violence.\r\n\r\n  EXUVIAE. Properly speaking, the transient parts of certain animals\r\n    which they put off or lay down to assume new ones, as serpents and\r\n    caterpillars shift their skins; but in geology it refers not only to\r\n    the cast-off coverings of animals, but to fossil shells and other\r\n    remains which animals have left in the strata of the earth. _Etym._,\r\n    _exuere_, to put off or divest.\r\n\r\n  FALUNS.

The various kinds of animals peculiar to a country constitute\r\n    its FAUNA, as the various kinds of plants constitute its FLORA. The\r\n    term is derived from the FAUNI, or rural deities, in Roman\r\n    Mythology.\r\n\r\n  FELSPAR. A simple mineral, which, next to quartz, constitutes the\r\n    chief material of rocks. The white angular portions in granite are\r\n    felspar. This mineral always contains some alkali in its\r\n    composition. In _common felspar_ the alkali is potash; in another\r\n    variety, called Albite or Cleavlandite, it is soda. Glassy felspar\r\n    is a term applied when the crystals have a considerable degree of\r\n    transparency. _Compact_ felspar is a name of more vague\r\n    signification. The substance so called appears to contain both\r\n    potash and soda.\r\n\r\n  FELSPATHIC. Of or belonging to felspar.\r\n\r\n  FERRUGINOUS.

A group, whether of alluvial deposits, sedimentary\r\n    strata, or igneous rocks, referred to a common origin or period.\r\n\r\n  FOSSIL. All minerals were once called fossils, but geologists now\r\n    use the word only to express the remains of animals and plants found\r\n    buried in the earth. _Etym._, _fossilis_, any thing that may be dug\r\n    out of the earth.\r\n\r\n  FOSSILIFEROUS.

A kind of crocodile found in India.\r\n\r\n  GEM, or GEMMULE, from the Latin _gemma_, a bud. The term, applied to\r\n    zoophytes, means a young animal not confined within an envelope or\r\n    egg.\r\n\r\n  GEOLOGY, GEOGNOSY. Both mean the same thing; but with an unnecessary\r\n    degree of refinement in terms, it has been proposed to call our\r\n    description of the structure of the earth _geognosy_ (_Etym._,\r\n    [Greek: gea], _gea_, earth, and [Greek: ginosco, _ginosco_, to\r\n    know), and our theoretical speculations as to its formation\r\n    _geology_ (_Etym._, [Greek: gea], and [Greek: logos], _logos_, a\r\n    discourse).\r\n\r\n  GLACIER.

An unstratified or igneous rock, generally found inferior\r\n    to or associated with the oldest of the stratified rocks, and\r\n    sometimes penetrating them in the form of dikes and veins. It is\r\n    usually composed of three simple minerals, felspar, quartz, and\r\n    mica, and derives its name from having a coarse _granular_\r\n    structure; _granum_, Latin for grain. Waterloo bridge, and the\r\n    paving-stones in the carriage-way of the London streets, afford good\r\n    examples of the most common varieties of granite.\r\n\r\n  GREENSAND. Beds of sand, sandstone, limestone, belonging to the\r\n    Cretaceous Period. The name is given to these beds because they\r\n    often, but not always, contain an abundance of green earth or\r\n    chlorite scattered through the substance of the sandstone,\r\n    limestone, &c.\r\n\r\n  GREENSTONE. A variety of trap, composed of hornblende and felspar.\r\n\r\n  GREYWACKE. _Grauwacke_, a German name, generally adopted by\r\n    geologists for some of the most ancient fossiliferous strata. The\r\n    rock is very often of a gray color; hence the name, _grau_, being\r\n  German for gray, and _wacke_, being a provincial miner's term.\r\n\r\n  GRIT. A provincial name for a coarse-grained sandstone.\r\n\r\n  GYMNOSPERMOUS. _Etym._, [Greek: gymnos], _gymnos_, naked, and\r\n    [Greek: sperma], _sperma_, a seed. (See GYMNOGENS.)\r\n\r\n  GYMNOGENS.

It includes all\r\n    _Coniferae_, as pine, fir, juniper, cypress, yew, cedar, &c., and\r\n    _Cycadeae_. All are Dicotyledonous (a few have many cotyledons), and\r\n    all Exogenous, except _Cycas_, the growth of which is anomalous. The\r\n    term is applied in contradistinction to _Angiosperms_, which see.\r\n    _Etym._, [Greek: gymnos], naked, and [Greek: genesis], increase.\r\n\r\n  GYPSUM. A mineral composed of lime and sulphuric acid, hence called\r\n    also _sulphate_ of _lime_. Plaster and stucco are obtained by\r\n    exposing gypsum to a strong heat. It is found so abundantly near\r\n    Paris, that plaster of Paris is a common term in this country for\r\n    the white powder of which casts are made. The term is used by Pliny\r\n    for a stone used for the same purposes by the ancients. The\r\n    derivation is unknown.\r\n\r\n  GYPSEOUS, of or belonging to gypsum.\r\n\r\n  GYROGONITES.

Those rocks which are _nether-formed_, or which have\r\n    not assumed their present form and structure at the surface, such as\r\n    granite, gneiss, &c. The term, which includes both the plutonic and\r\n    metamorphic rocks, is substituted for _primary_, because some\r\n    members of both these classes, such as granite and gneiss, are\r\n    posterior to many secondary or fossiliferous rocks. _Etym._, [Greek:\r\n    hypo], _hypo_, under, and [Greek: ginomai], _ginomai_, to be formed\r\n    or produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ICEBERG.

White hot--having a more intense degree of heat than\r\n    red heat.\r\n\r\n  INDUCTION. A consequence, inference, or general principle drawn from\r\n    a number of particular facts or phenomena. The inductive philosophy,\r\n    says Mr. Whewell, has been rightly described as a science which\r\n    ascends from particular facts to general principles, and then\r\n    descends again from these general principles to particular\r\n    applications.\r\n\r\n  INFUSORY ANIMALCULES. Minute living creatures found in many\r\n    _infusions_; and the term _infusori_ has been given to all such\r\n    animalcules, whether found in infusions or in stagnant water,\r\n    vinegar, &c.\r\n\r\n  INSPISSATED.

A class of flowerless plants including all those that\r\n    have no defined axis, stem, or leaves; as Lichens, Seaweeds, and\r\n    Fungi. _Etym._, [Greek: thallos], _thallos_, a branch, and [Greek:\r\n    genesis], _genesis_, increase.\r\n\r\n  THERMAL. Hot. _Etym._, [Greek: thermos], _thermos_, hot.\r\n\r\n  THERMO-ELECTRICITY. Electricity developed by heat.\r\n\r\n  THIN OUT. When a stratum, in the course of its prolongation in any\r\n    direction, becomes gradually less in thickness, the two surfaces\r\n    approach nearer and nearer; and when at last they meet, the stratum\r\n    is said to thin out or disappear.\r\n\r\n  TRACHYTE. A variety of lava essentially composed of glassy felspar,\r\n    and frequently having detached crystals of felspar in the base or\r\n    body of the stone, giving it the structure of porphyry. It sometimes\r\n    contains hornblende and augite; and when these last predominate, the\r\n    trachyte passes into the varieties of trap, called Greenstone,\r\n    Basalt, Dolorite, &c. The term is derived from [Greek: trachus],\r\n    _trachus_, rough, because the rock has a peculiar rough feel.\r\n\r\n  TRAP and TRAPPEAN ROCKS. Volcanic rocks composed of felspar, augite,\r\n    and hornblende. The various proportions and state of aggregation of\r\n    these simple minerals, and differences in external forms, give rise\r\n    to varieties, which have received distinct appellations, such as\r\n    Basalt, Amygdaloid, Dolorite, Greenstone, and others. The term is\r\n    derived from _trappa_, a Swedish word for stair, because the rocks\r\n    of this class sometimes occur in large tabular masses, rising one\r\n    above another like steps.\r\n\r\n  TRAVERTIN. A white concretionary limestone, usually hard and\r\n    semi-crystalline, deposited from the water of springs holding lime\r\n    in solution.--_Etym._ This stone was called by the ancients Lapis\r\n    Tiburtinus, the stone being formed in great quantity by the river\r\n    Anio, at Tibur, near Rome. Some suppose travertin to be an\r\n    abbreviation of trasterverino from transtiburtinus.\r\n\r\n  TRIPOLI. The name of a powder used for polishing metals and stones,\r\n    first imported from Tripoli, which, as well as a certain kind of\r\n    siliceous stone of the same name, has been lately found to be\r\n    composed of the flinty cases of Infusoria.\r\n\r\n  TROPHI, of Insects. Organs which form the mouth, consisting of an\r\n    upper and under lip, and comprising the parts called mandibles,\r\n    maxillae, and palpi.\r\n\r\n  TUFA, CALCAREOUS. A porous rock deposited by calcareous waters on\r\n    their exposure to the air, and usually containing portions of plants\r\n    and other organic substances incrusted with carbonate of lime. The\r\n    more solid form of the same deposit is called \"travertin,\" into\r\n    which it passes.\r\n\r\n  TUFA, VOLCANIC. See \"Tuff.\"\r\n\r\n  TUFACEOUS. A rock with the texture of tuff, or tufa, which see.\r\n\r\n  TUFF, or TUFA VOLCANIC. An Italian name for a variety of volcanic\r\n    rock of an earthy texture, seldom very compact, and composed of an\r\n    agglutination of fragments of scoriae and loose materials ejected\r\n    from a volcano.\r\n\r\n  TURBINATED. Shells which have a spiral or screw-form structure.\r\n    _Etym._, _turbinatus_, made like a top.\r\n\r\n  TURRILITE. An extinct genus of chambered shells, allied to the\r\n    Ammonites, having the siphuncle near the dorsal margin.\r\n\r\n\r\n  UNCONFORMABLE. See \"Conformable.\"\r\n\r\n  UNOXIDIZED, UNOXIDATED. Not combined with oxygen.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VEINS, MINERAL. Cracks in rocks filled up by substances different\r\n    from the rock, which may either be earthy or metallic. Veins are\r\n    sometimes many yards wide; and they ramify or branch off into\r\n    innumerable smaller parts, often as slender as threads, like the\r\n    veins in an animal, hence their name.\r\n\r\n  VERTEBRATED ANIMALS. A great division of the animal kingdom,\r\n    including all those which are furnished with a back-bone, as the\r\n    mammalia, birds, reptiles, and fishes. The separate joints of the\r\n    back-bone are called _vertebrae_, from the Latin verb _verto_, to\r\n    turn.\r\n\r\n  VESICLE. A small, circular, inclosed space, like a little bladder.\r\n    _Etym._, diminutive of _vesica_, Latin for a bladder.\r\n\r\n  VITRIFICATION. The conversion of a body into glass by heat.\r\n\r\n  VOLCANIC BOMBS. Volcanoes throw out sometimes detached masses of\r\n    melted lava, which, as they fall, assume rounded forms (like\r\n    bomb-shells), and are often elongated into a pear-shape.\r\n\r\n  VOLCANIC FOCI. The subterranean centres of action in volcanoes,\r\n    where the heat is supposed to be in the highest degree of energy.\r\n\r\n  WACKE. A rock nearly allied to basalt, of which it may be regarded\r\n    as a soft and earthy variety.\r\n\r\n  WARP. The deposit of muddy waters, artificially introduced into low\r\n    lands. See p. 326.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ZEOLITE. A family of simple minerals, including stilbite, mesotype,\r\n    analcime, and some others, usually found in the trap or volcanic\r\n    rocks. Some of the most common varieties swell or boil up when\r\n    exposed to the blow-pipe, and hence the name of [Greek: zeo], _zeo_,\r\n    to boil, and [Greek: lithos], _lithos_, stone.\r\n\r\n  ZOOPHITES. Corals, sponges, and other aquatic animals allied to\r\n    them; so called because, while they are the habitation of animals,\r\n    they are fixed to the ground, and have the form of plants. _Etym._,\r\n    [Greek: zoon], _zoon_, animal, and [Greek: phyton], _phyton_, plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n  Abich, M., on eruption of Vesuvius in 1834, 378, 380, 550.\r\n\r\n  Abo, 522, 523.\r\n\r\n  Acosta cited, 499, 502.\r\n\r\n  Adams, Mr., on fossil elephant, 80.\r\n\r\n  Adanson on age of the baobab tree, 422.\r\n\r\n  Addison on Burnet's theory, 32.\r\n\r\n  Adige, embankment of the, 255.\r\n  ----, delta of the, 257.\r\n\r\n  Adour, R., new passage formed by, 338.\r\n\r\n  Adria, formerly a seaport, 256.\r\n\r\n  Adriatic, deposits in, 36, 88, 71, 257, 774.\r\n\r\n  AEgean Sea, Prof. E.

A., F. R. S.,\r\n\r\n_Author of \"Principles of Geology\" &c., &c._\r\n\r\nReprinted from the last London, Entirely Revised Edition. Illustrated\r\nwith Five Hundred Wood-Cuts. One handsome volume, large 8vo. Price $1\r\n75.\r\n\r\n   \"The author of this work stands in the very front rank of\r\n   scientific men, and his works upon the sciences, to which he\r\n   has devoted his great powers, and his Indefatigable study, are\r\n   the standard books upon those subjects. This Manual has had a\r\n   very great sale in England, and its successive editions have\r\n   kept pace with the steady progress of geological science. To\r\n   the last edition, new and important pages have been added,\r\n   containing the latest discoveries In geology. This study has\r\n   never before received so great attention as at present, and in\r\n   no other country can it be studied so profitably and with such\r\n   practical results as in this.\"--_Providence Journal._\r\n\r\n   \"This is a standard work, on one of the most wonderful of\r\n   modern sciences. In connection with the \"Principles of\r\n   Geology,\" by the same author, it gives a complete survey of\r\n   the science at its present stage of advancement. We commend\r\n   these works to the serious attention of those fossil\r\n   theologians who esteem it their duty to bring the Bible, if\r\n   they can, into conflict with the inductive sciences, and who\r\n   think that their interpretation of Genesis is a sufficient\r\n   reply to all the inductions of Geology.\"--_Recorder._\r\n\r\n   \"The author of this volume is among the most eminent of\r\n   geologists, and is well qualified to make an exposition of the\r\n   science. This \"Manual\" is not intended as an epitome of\r\n   another work, \"The Principles of Geology,\" but occupies a\r\n   distinct place, the \"Principles\" containing a view of the\r\n   _Modern_ changes of the Earth and its inhabitants, while the\r\n   \"Manual\" relates to the Monuments of _Ancient_ changes. The\r\n   author recommends to the student of geology who wishes to\r\n   examine his works, to commence with the \"Principles,\" a new\r\n   and thoroughly revised edition of which is just about tube\r\n   issued by the Publishers of the present volume. \"We are not\r\n   among those who apprehend injury to the cause of Scripture\r\n   truth, by the study of this science, and we only wish it were\r\n   more generally and thoroughly investigated by sound minds. It\r\n   is imperative on all theologians, and those designing to\r\n   become such, to make this a branch, of study, and thus to be\r\n   prepared to defend the truth when it is assayed, as it has\r\n   been by men of science. The truth has nothing to fear, but\r\n   every thing to gain even from scientific\r\n   investigation.\"--_Observer._\r\n\r\n\r\nD. APPLETON & CO.
