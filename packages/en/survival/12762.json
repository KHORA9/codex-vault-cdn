But there are few now who do not know what was the origin of\r\nthe coal which they use so freely, and which in obedience to their demand\r\nhas been brought up more than a thousand feet from the bowels of the\r\nearth; and, although familiarity has in a sense bred contempt for that\r\nwhich a few shillings will always purchase, in all probability a stray\r\nthought does occasionally cross one's mind, giving birth to feelings of a\r\nmore or less thankful nature that such a store of heat and light was long\r\nago laid up in this earth of ours for our use, when as yet man was not\r\ndestined to put in an appearance for many, many ages to come. We can\r\nscarcely imagine the industrial condition of our country in the absence\r\nof so fortunate a supply of coal; and the many good things which are\r\nobtained from it, and the uses to which, as we shall see, it can be put,\r\ndo indeed demand recognition.\r\n\r\nWere our present forests uprooted and overthrown, to be covered by\r\nsedimentary deposits such as those which cover our coal-seams, the amount\r\nof coal which would be thereby formed for use in some future age, would\r\namount to a thickness of perhaps two or three inches at most, and yet, in\r\none coal-field alone, that of Westphalia, the 117 most important seams,\r\nif placed one above the other in immediate succession, would amount to no\r\nless than 294 feet of coal. From this it is possible to form a faint idea\r\nof the enormous growths of vegetation required to form some of our\r\nrepresentative coal beds. But the coal is not found in one continuous\r\nbed. These numerous seams of coal are interspersed between many thousands\r\nof feet of sedimentary deposits, the whole of which form the\r\n\"coal-measures.\" Now, each of these seams represents the growth of a\r\nforest, and to explain the whole series it is necessary to suppose that\r\nbetween each deposit the land became overwhelmed by the waters of the sea\r\nor lake, and after a long subaqueous period, was again raised into dry\r\nland, ready to become the birth-place of another forest, which would\r\nagain beget, under similarly repeated conditions, another seam of coal.\r\nOf the conditions necessary to bring these changes about we will speak\r\nlater on, but this instance is sufficient to show how inadequate the\r\nquantity of fuel would be, were we dependent entirely on our own existing\r\nforest growths.\r\n\r\nHowever, we will leave for the present the fascinating pursuit of\r\ntheorising as to the how and wherefore of these vast beds of coal,\r\nrelegating  the geological part of the study of the carboniferous system\r\nto a future chapter, where will be found some more detailed account of\r\nthe position of the coal-seams in the strata which contain them. At\r\npresent the actual details of the coal itself will demand our attention.\r\n\r\nCoal is the mineral which has resulted, after the lapse of thousands of\r\nthousands of years, from the accumulations of vegetable material, caused\r\nby the steady yearly shedding of leaves, fronds and spores, from forests\r\nwhich existed in an early age; these accumulated where the trees grew\r\nthat bore them, and formed in the first place, perhaps, beds of peat; the\r\nbeds have since been subjected to an ever-increasing pressure of\r\naccumulating strata above them, compressing the sheddings of a whole\r\nforest into a thickness in some cases of a few inches of coal, and have\r\nbeen acted upon by the internal heat of the earth, which has caused them\r\nto part, to a varying degree, with some of their component gases. If we\r\nreason from analogy, we are compelled to admit that the origin of coal is\r\ndue to the accumulation of vegetation, of which more scattered, but more\r\ndistinct, representative specimens occur in the shales and clays above\r\nand below the coal-seams. But we are also able to examine the texture\r\nitself of the various coals by submitting extremely thin slices to a\r\nstrong light under the microscope, and are thus enabled to decide whether\r\nthe particular coal we are examining is formed of conifers, horse-tails,\r\nclub-mosses, or ferns, or whether it consists simply of the accumulated\r\nsheddings of all, or perhaps, as in some instances, of innumerable\r\nspores.\r\n\r\nIn this way the structure of coal can be accurately determined. Were we\r\nartificially to prepare a mass of vegetable substance, and covering it up\r\nentirely, subject it to great pressure, so that but little of the\r\nvolatile gases which would be formed could escape, we might in the course\r\nof time produce something approaching coal, but whether we obtained\r\nlignite, jet, common bituminous coal, or anthracite, would depend upon\r\nthe possibilities of escape for the gases contained in the mass.\r\n\r\nEverybody has doubtless noticed that, when a stagnant pool which contains\r\na good deal of decaying vegetation is stirred, bubbles of gas rise to the\r\nsurface from the mud below. This gas is known as marsh-gas, or light\r\ncarburetted hydrogen, and gives rise to the _ignis fatuus_ which hovers\r\nabout marshy land, and which is said to lure the weary traveller to his\r\ndoom. The vegetable mud is here undergoing rapid decomposition, as there\r\nis nothing to stay its progress, and no superposed load of strata\r\nconfining its resulting products within itself. The gases therefore\r\nescape, and the breaking-up of the tissues of the vegetation goes on\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nThe chemical changes which have taken place in the beds of vegetation of\r\nthe carboniferous epoch, and which have transformed it into coal, are\r\neven now but imperfectly understood. All we know is that, under certain\r\ncircumstances, one kind of coal is formed, whilst under other conditions,\r\nother kinds have resulted; whilst in some cases the processes have\r\nresulted in the preparation of large quantities of mineral oils, such as\r\nnaphtha and petroleum. Oils are also artificially produced from the\r\nso-called waste-products of the gas-works, but in some parts of the world\r\nthe process of their manufacture has gone on naturally, and a yearly\r\nincreasing quantity is being utilised. In England oil has been pumped up\r\nfrom the carboniferous strata of Coalbrook Dale, whilst in Sussex it has\r\nbeen found in smaller quantities, where, in all probability, it has had\r\nits origin in the lignitic beds of the Wealden strata. Immense quantities\r\nare used for fuel by the Russian steamers on the Caspian Sea, the Baku\r\npetroleum wells being a most valuable possession. In Sicily, Persia, and,\r\nfar more important, in the United States, mineral oils are found in great\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nIn all probability coniferous trees, similar to the living firs, pines,\r\nlarches, &c., gave rise for the most part to the mineral oils. The class\r\nof living _coniferae_ is well known for the various oils which it\r\nfurnishes naturally, and for others which its representatives yield on\r\nbeing subjected to distillation. The gradually increasing amount of heat\r\nwhich we meet the deeper we go beneath the surface, has been the cause of\r\na slow and continuous distillation, whilst the oil so distilled has found\r\nits way to the surface in the shape of mineral-oil springs, or has\r\naccumulated in troughs in the strata, ready for use, to be drawn up when\r\na well has been sunk into it.\r\n\r\nThe plants which have gone to make up the coal are not at once apparent\r\nto the naked eye. We have to search among the shales and clays and\r\nsandstones which enclose the coal-seams, and in these we find petrified\r\nspecimens which enable us to build up in our mind pictures of the\r\nvegetable creation which formed the jungles and forests of these\r\nimmensely remote ages, and which, densely packed together on the old\r\nforest floor of those days, is now apparent to us as coal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--_Annularia radiata._ Carboniferous sandstone.]\r\n\r\nA very large proportion of the plants which have been found in the\r\ncoal-bearing strata consists of numerous species of ferns, the number of\r\nactual species which have been preserved for us in our English coal,\r\nbeing double the number now existing in Europe. The greater part of these\r\ndo not seem to have been very much larger than our own living ferns, and,\r\nindeed, many of them bear a close resemblance to some of our own living\r\nspecies. The impressions they have left on the shales of the\r\ncoal-measures are most striking, and point to a time when the sandy clay\r\nwhich imbedded them was borne by water in a very tranquil manner, to be\r\ndeposited where the ferns had grown, enveloping them gradually, and\r\nconsolidating them into their mass of future shale. In one species known\r\nas the _neuropteris_, the nerves of the leaves are as clear and as\r\napparent as in a newly-grown fern, the name being derived from two Greek\r\nwords meaning \"nerve-fern.\" It is interesting to consider the history of\r\nsuch a leaf, throughout the ages that have elapsed since it was part of a\r\nliving fern. First it grew up as a new frond, then gradually unfolded\r\nitself, and developed into the perfect fern. Then it became cut off by\r\nthe rising waters, and buried beneath an accumulation of sediment, and\r\nwhile momentous changes have gone on in connection with the surface of\r\nthe earth, it has lain dormant in its hiding-place exactly as we see it,\r\nuntil now excavated, with its contemporaneous vegetation, to form fuel\r\nfor our winter fires.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--_Rhacopteris inaequilatera._ Carboniferous\r\nlimestone.]\r\n\r\nAlthough many of the ferns greatly resembled existing species, yet there\r\nwere others in these ancient days utterly unlike anything indigenous to\r\nEngland now. There were undoubted tree-ferns, similar to those which\r\nthrive now so luxuriously in the tropics, and which throw out their\r\ngraceful crowns of ferns at the head of a naked stem, whilst on the bark\r\nare the marks at different levels of the points of attachment of former\r\nleaves. These have left in their places cicatrices or scars, showing the\r\nplaces from which they formerly grew. Amongst the tree-ferns found are\r\n_megaphyton_, _paloeopteris_, and _caulopteris_, all of which have these\r\nmarks upon them, thus proving that at one time even tree-ferns had a\r\nhabitat in England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Frond of _Pecopteris._ Coal-shale.]\r\n\r\nOne form of tree-fern is known by the name of _Psaronius_, and this was\r\npeculiar in the possession of masses of aerial roots grouped round the\r\nstem. Some of the smaller species exhibit forms of leaves which are\r\nutterly unknown in the nomenclature of living ferns. Most have had names\r\nassigned to them in accordance with certain characteristics which they\r\npossess. This was the more possible since the fossilised impressions had\r\nbeen retained in so distinct a manner. Here before us is a specimen in a\r\nshale of _pecopteris_, as it is called, (_pekos_, a comb). The leaf in\r\nsome species is not altogether unlike the well-known living fern\r\n_osmunda_. The position of the pinnules on both sides of the central\r\nstalk are seen in the fossil to be shaped something like a comb, or a\r\nsaw, whilst up the centre of each pinnule the vein is as prominent and\r\nnoticeable as if the fern were but yesterday waving gracefully in the\r\nair, and but to-day imbedded in its shaly bed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--_Pecopteris Serlii_. Coal-shale.]\r\n\r\n_Sphenopteris_, or \"wedge-fern,\" is the name applied to another\r\ncoal-fern; _glossopteris_, or \"tongue-leaf\"; _cyclopteris_, or\r\n\"round-leaf\"; _odonlopteris,_ or \"tooth-leaf,\" and many others, show\r\ntheir chief characteristics in the names which they individually bear.\r\n_Alethopteris_ appears to have been the common brake of the coal-period,\r\nand in some respects resembles _pecopteris_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--_Sphenopteris Affinis._ Coal-shale.]\r\n\r\nIn some species of ferns so exact are the representations which they have\r\nimpressed on the shale which contains them, that not only are the veins\r\nand nerves distinctly visible, but even the fructification still remains\r\nin the shape of the marks left by the so-called seeds on the backs of the\r\nleaves. Something more than a passing look at the coal specimens in a\r\ngood museum will well repay the time so spent.\r\n\r\nWhat are known as septarian nodules, or snake-stones, are, at certain\r\nplaces, common in the carboniferous strata. They are composed of layers\r\nof ironstone and sandstone which have segregated around some central\r\nobject, such as a fern-leaf or a shell. When the leaf of a fern has been\r\nfound to be the central object, it has been noticed that the leaf can\r\nsometimes be separated from the stone in the form of a carbonaceous film.\r\n\r\nExperiments were made many years ago by M. Goppert to illustrate the\r\nprocess of fossilisation of ferns. Having placed some living ferns in a\r\nmass of clay and dried them, he exposed them to a red heat, and obtained\r\nthereby striking resemblances to fossil plants. According to the degree\r\nof heat to which they were subjected, the plants were found to be either\r\nbrown, a shining black, or entirely lost. In the last mentioned case,\r\nonly the impression remained, but the carbonaceous matter had gone to\r\nstain the surrounding clay black, thus indicating that the dark colour of\r\nthe coal-shales is due to the carbon derived from the plants which they\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nAnother very prominent member of the vegetation of the coal period, was\r\nthat order of plants known as the _Calamites_. The generic distinctions\r\nbetween fossil and living ferns were so slight in many cases as to be\r\nalmost indistinguishable. This resemblance between the ancient and the\r\nmodern is not found so apparent in other plants. The Calamites of the\r\ncoal-measures bore indeed a very striking resemblance, and were closely\r\nrelated, to our modern horse-tails, as the _equiseta_ are popularly\r\ncalled; but in some respects they differed considerably.\r\n\r\nMost people are acquainted with the horse-tail (_equisetum fluviatile)_\r\nof our marshes and ditches. It is a somewhat graceful plant, and stands\r\nerect with a jointed stem. The foliage is arranged in whorls around the\r\njoints, and, unlike its fossil representatives, its joints are protected\r\nby striated sheaths. The stem of the largest living species rarely\r\nexceeds half-an-inch in diameter, whilst that of the calamite attained a\r\nthickness of five inches. But the great point which is noticeable in the\r\nfossil calamites and _equisetites_ is that they grew to a far greater\r\nheight than any similar plant now living, sometimes being as much as\r\neight feet high. In the nature of their stems, too, they exhibited a more\r\nhighly organised arrangement than their living representatives, having,\r\naccording to Dr Williamson, a \"fistular pith, an exogenous woody stem,\r\nand a thick smooth bark.\" The bark having almost al ways disappeared has\r\nleft the fluted stem known to us as the calamite. The foliage consisted\r\nof whorls of long narrow leaves, which differed only from the fern\r\n_asterophyllites_ in the fact that they were single-nerved. Sir William\r\nDawson assigns the calamites to four sub-types: _calamite_ proper,\r\n_calamopitus, calamodendron_, and _eucalamodendron_.\r\n\r\n[Image: FIG. 7.--Root of _Catamites Suckowii_. Coal-shale.]\r\n\r\n[Image: FIG 8.--_Calamocladus grandis_. Carboniferous sandstone.]\r\n\r\nHaving used the word \"exogenous,\" it might be as well to pay a little\r\nattention, in passing, to the nomenclature and broad classification of\r\nthe various kinds of plants. We shall then doubtless find it far easier\r\nthoroughly to understand the position in the scale of organisation to\r\nwhich the coal plants are referable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--_Asterophyllites foliosa_. Coal-measures.]\r\n\r\nThe plants which are lowest in organisation are known as _Cellular_. They\r\nare almost entirely composed of numerous cells built up one above the\r\nother, and possess none of the higher forms of tissue and organisation\r\nwhich are met with elsewhere. This division includes the lichens,\r\nsea-weeds, confervae (green aquatic scum), fungi (mushrooms, dry-rot),\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe division of _Vascular_ plants includes the far larger proportion of\r\nvegetation, both living and fossil, and these plants are built up of\r\nvessels and tissues of various shapes and character.\r\n\r\nAll plants are divided into (1) Cryptogams, or Flowerless, such as\r\nmosses, ferns, equisetums, and (2) Phanerogams, or Flowering. Flowering\r\nplants are again divided into those with naked seeds, as the conifers and\r\ncycads (gymnosperms), and those whose seeds are enclosed in vessels, or\r\novaries (angiosperms).\r\n\r\nAngiosperms are again divided into the monocotyledons, as the palms, and\r\ndicotyledons, which include most European trees.\r\n\r\nThus:--\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n|   (M.A. Brongniart).          |                     |(Lindley). |\r\n|CELLULAR                       |                     |           |\r\n| _Cryptogams_ (Flowerless)     |Fungi, seaweeds,     |Thallogens |\r\n|                               |  lichens            |           |\r\n|                               |                     |           |\r\n|VASCULAR                       |                     |           |\r\n| _Cryptogams_ (Flowerless)     |Ferns, equisetums,   |Acrogens   |\r\n|                               |  mosses, lycopodiums|           |\r\n| _Phanerogams_ (Flowering)     |                     |           |\r\n|     Gymnosperms (having       |Conifers and         |Gymnogens  |\r\n|        naked seeds)           |  cycads             |           |\r\n|     Two or more Cotyledons    |                     |           |\r\n|     Angiosperms (having       |                     |           |\r\n|        enclosed seeds)        |                     |           |\r\n|     Monocotyledons            |Palms, lilies,       |Endogens   |\r\n|                               |  grasses            |           |\r\n|     Dicotyledons              |Most European        |Exogens    |\r\n|                               |  trees and shrubs   |           |\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAdolphe Brongniart termed the coal era the \"Age of Acrogens,\" because, as\r\nwe shall see, of the great predominance in those times of vascular\r\ncryptogamic plants, known in Dr Lindley's nomenclature as \"Acrogens.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--_Spenophyllum cuneifolium._ Coal-shale.]\r\n\r\nTwo of these families have already been dealt with, viz., the ferns\r\n(_felices_), and the equisetums, (_calamites_ and _equisetites_), and we\r\nnow have to pass on to another family. This is that which includes the\r\nfossil representatives of the Lycopodiums, or Club-mosses, and which goes\r\nto make up in some coals as much as two-thirds of the whole mass.\r\nEveryone is more or less familiar with some of the living Lycopodiums,\r\nthose delicate little fern-like mosses which are to be found in many a\r\nhome. They are but lowly members of our British flora, and it may seem\r\nsomewhat astounding at first sight that their remote ancestors occupied\r\nso important a position in the forests of the ancient period of which we\r\nare speaking. Some two hundred living species are known, most of them\r\nbeing confined to tropical climates. They are as a rule, low creeping\r\nplants, although some few stand erect. There is room for astonishment\r\nwhen we consider the fact that the fossil representatives of the family,\r\nknown as _Lepidodendra_, attained a height of no less than fifty feet,\r\nand, there is good ground for believing, in many cases, a far greater\r\nmagnitude. They consist of long straight stems, or trunks which branch\r\nconsiderably near the top. These stems are covered with scars or scales,\r\nwhich have been caused by the separation of the petioles or leaf-stalks,\r\nand this gives rise to the name which the genus bears. The scars are\r\narranged in a spiral manner the whole of the way up the stem, and the\r\nstems often remain perfectly upright in the coal-mines, and reach into\r\nthe strata which have accumulated above the coal-seam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Cast of _lepidodendron_ in sandstone.]\r\n\r\nCount Sternberg remarked that we are unacquainted with any existing\r\nspecies of plant, which like the _Lepidodendron_, preserves at all ages,\r\nand throughout the whole extent of the trunk, the scars formed by the\r\nattachment of the petioles, or leaf-stalks, or the markings of the leaves\r\nthemselves. The yucca, dracaena, and palm, entirely shed their scales\r\nwhen they are dried up, and there only remain circles, or rings, arranged\r\nround the trunk in different directions. The flabelliform palms preserve\r\ntheir scales at the inferior extremity of the trunk only, but lose them\r\nas they increase in age; and the stem is entirely bare, from the middle\r\nto the superior extremity. In the ancient _Lepidodendron_, on the other\r\nhand, the more ancient the scale of the leaf-stalk, the more apparent it\r\nstill remains. Portions of stems have been discovered which contain\r\nleaf-scars far larger than those referred to above, and we deduce from\r\nthese fragments the fact that those individuals which have been found\r\nwhole, are not by any means the largest of those which went to form so\r\nlarge a proportion of the ancient coal-forests. The _lepidodendra_ bore\r\nlinear one-nerved leaves, and the stems always branched dichotomously and\r\npossessed a central pith. Specimens variously named _knorria,\r\nlepidophloios, halonia_, and _ulodendron_ are all referable to this\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--_Lepidodendron longifolium._ Coal-shale.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--_Lepidodendron aculeatum_ in sandstone.]\r\n\r\nIn some strata, as for instance that of the Shropshire coalfield,\r\nquantities of elongated cylindrical bodies known as _lepidostrobi_ have\r\nbeen found, which, it was early conjectured, were the fruit of the giant\r\nclub-mosses about which we have just been speaking. Their appearance can\r\nbe called to mind by imagining the cylindrical fruit of the maize or\r\nIndian corn to be reduced to some three or four inches in length. The\r\nsporangia or cases which contained the microscopic  spores or seeds were\r\narranged around a central axis in a somewhat similar manner to that in\r\nwhich maize is found. These bodies have since been found actually\r\nsituated at the end of branches of _lepidodendron_, thus placing their\r\ntrue nature beyond a doubt. The fossil seeds (spores) do not appear to\r\nhave exceeded in volume those of recent club-mosses, and this although\r\nthe actual trees themselves grew to a size very many times greater than\r\nthe living species. This minuteness of the seed-germs goes to explain the\r\nreason why, as Sir Charles Lyell remarked, the same species of\r\n_lepidodendra_ are so widely distributed in the coal measures of Europe\r\nand America, their spores being capable of an easy transportation by the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--_Lepidostrobus._ Coal-shale.]\r\n\r\nOne striking feature in connection with the fruit of the _lepidodendron_\r\nand other ancient representatives of the club-moss tribe, is that the\r\nbituminous coals in many, if not in most, instances, are made up almost\r\nentirely of their spores and spore-cases. Under a microscope, a piece of\r\nsuch coal is seen to be thronged with the minute rounded bodies of the\r\nspores interlacing one another and forming almost the whole mass, whilst\r\nlarger than these, and often indeed enclosing them, are flattened\r\nbag-like bodies which are none other than the compressed sporangia which\r\ncontained the former.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--_Lycopodites_. Coal sandstone.]\r\n\r\nNow, the little Scottish or Alpine club-moss which is so familiar,\r\nproduces its own little cones, each with its series of outside scales or\r\nleaves; these are attached to the bags or spore-cases, which are crowded\r\nwith spores. Although in miniature, yet it produces its fruit in just the\r\nsame way, at the terminations of its little branches, and the spores, the\r\nactual germs of life, when examined microscopically, are scarcely\r\ndistinguishable from those which are contained in certain bituminous\r\ncoals. And, although ancient club-mosses have been found in a fossilised\r\ncondition at least forty-nine feet high, the spores are no larger than\r\nthose of our miniature club-mosses of the present day.\r\n\r\nThe spores are more or less composed of pure bitumen, and the bituminous\r\nnature of the coal depends largely on the presence or absence of these\r\nmicroscopic bodies in it. The spores of the living club-mosses contain so\r\nmuch resinous matter that they are now largely used in the making of\r\nfireworks, and upon the presence of this altered resinous matter in coal\r\ndepends its capability of providing a good blazing coal.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it seems almost impossible that such a minute cause should\r\nresult in the formation of huge masses of coal, such an inconceivable\r\nnumber of spores being necessary to make even the smallest fragment of\r\ncoal. But if we look at the cloud of spores that can be shaken from a\r\nsingle spike of a club-moss, then imagine this to be repeated a thousand\r\ntimes from each branch of a fairly tall tree, and then finally picture a\r\nwhole forest of such trees shedding in due season their copious showers\r\nof spores to earth, we shall perhaps be less amazed than we were at first\r\nthought, at the stupendous result wrought out by so minute an object.\r\n\r\nAnother well-known form of carboniferous vegetation is that known as the\r\n_Sigillaria_, and, connected with this form is one, which was long\r\nfamiliar under the name of _Stigmaria_, but which has since been\r\nsatisfactorily proved to have formed the branching root of the\r\nsigillaria. The older geologists were in the habit of placing these\r\nplants among the tree-ferns, principally on account of the cicatrices\r\nwhich were left at the junctions of the leaf-stalks with the stem, after\r\nthe former had fallen off. No foliage had, however, been met with which\r\nwas actually attached to the plants, and hence, when it was discovered\r\nthat some of them had long attenuated leaves not at all like those\r\npossessed by ferns, geologists were compelled to abandon this\r\nclassification of them, and even now no satisfactory reference to\r\nexisting orders of them has been made, owing to their anomalous\r\nstructure. The stems are fluted from base to stem, although this is not\r\nso apparent near the base, whilst the raised prominences which now form\r\nthe cicatrices, are arranged at regular distances within the vertical\r\ngrooves.\r\n\r\nWhen they have remained standing for some length of time, and the strata\r\nhave been allowed quietly to accumulate around the trunks, they have\r\nescaped compression. They were evidently, to a great extent, hollow like\r\na reed, so that in those trees which still remain vertical, the interior\r\nhas become filled up by a coat of sandstone, whilst the bark has become\r\ntransformed into an envelope of an inch, or half an inch of coal. But\r\nmany are found lying in the strata in a horizontal plane. These have been\r\ncast down and covered up by an ever-increasing load of strata, so that\r\nthe weight has, in the course of time, compressed the tree into simply\r\nthe thickness of the double bark, that is, of the two opposite sides of\r\nthe envelope which covered it when living.\r\n\r\n_Sigillarae_ grew to a very great height without branching, some\r\nspecimens having measured from 60 to 70 feet long. In accordance with\r\ntheir outside markings, certain types are known as _syringodendron_,\r\n_favularia_, and _clathraria_. _Diploxylon_ is a term applied to an\r\ninterior stem referable to this family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--_Stigmaria ficoides_. Coal-shale.]\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting point about the _sigillariae_ is the root. This\r\nwas for a long time regarded as an entirely distinct individual, and the\r\nolder geologists explained it in their writings as a species of succulent\r\naquatic plant, giving it the name of _stigmaria_. They realized the fact\r\nthat it was almost universally found in those beds which occur\r\nimmediately beneath the coal seams, but for a long time it did not strike\r\nthem that it might possibly be the root of a tree. In an old edition of\r\nLyell's \"Elements of Geology,\" utterly unlike existing editions in\r\nquality, quantity, or comprehensiveness, after describing it as an\r\nextinct species of water-plant, the author hazarded the conjecture that\r\nit might ultimately be found to have a connection with some other\r\nwell-known plant or tree. It was noticed that above the coal, in the\r\nroof, stigmariae were absent, and that the stems of trees which occurred\r\nthere, had become flattened by the weight of the overlying strata. The\r\nstigmariae on the other hand, abounded in the _underclay_, as it is\r\ncalled, and were not in any way compressed but retained what appeared to\r\nbe their natural shape and position. Hence to explain their appearance,\r\nit was thought that they were water-plants, ramifying the mud in every\r\ndirection, and finally becoming overwhelmed and covered by the mud\r\nitself. On botanical grounds, Brongniart and Lyell conjectured that they\r\nformed the roots of other trees, and this became the more apparent as it\r\ncame to be acknowledged that the underclays were really ancient soils.\r\nAll doubt was, however, finally dispelled by the discovery by Mr Binney,\r\nof a sigillaria and a stigmaria in actual connection with each other, in\r\nthe Lancashire coal-field.\r\n\r\nStigmariae have since been found in the Cape Breton coal-field, attached\r\nto Lepidodendra, about which we have already spoken, and a similar\r\ndiscovery has since been made in the British coal-fields. This,\r\ntherefore, would seem to shew the affinity of the sigillaria to the\r\nlepidodendron, and through it to the living lycopods, or\r\nclub-mosses.\r\n\r\nSome few species of stigmarian roots had been discovered, and various\r\nspecific names had been given to them before their actual nature was made\r\nout. What for some time were thought to be long cylindrical leaves, have\r\nnow been found to be simply rootlets, and in specimens where these have\r\nbeen removed, the surface of the stigmaria has been noticed to be covered\r\nwith large numbers of protuberant tubercles, which have formed the bases\r\nof the rootlets. There appears to have also been some special kind of\r\narrangement in their growth, since, unlike the roots of most living\r\nplants, the tubercles to which these rootlets were attached, were\r\narranged spirally around the main root. Each of these tubercles was\r\npitted in the centre, and into these the almost pointed ends of the\r\nrootlets fitted, as by a ball and socket joint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17--_Section of stigmaria_.]\r\n\r\n\"A single trunk of _sigillaria_ in an erect forest presents an epitome of\r\na coal-seam. Its roots represent the _stigmaria_ underclay; its bark the\r\ncompact coal; its woody axis, the mineral charcoal; its fallen leaves and\r\nfruits, with remains of herbaceous plants growing in its shade, mixed\r\nwith a little earthy matter, the layers of coarse coal. The condition of\r\nthe durable outer bark of erect trees, concurs with the chemical theory\r\nof coal, in showing the especial suitableness of this kind of tissue for\r\nthe production of the purer compact coals.\"--(Dawson, \"Structures in\r\nCoal.\")\r\n\r\nThere is yet one other family of plants which must be mentioned, and\r\nwhich forms a very important portion of the constituent _flora_ of the\r\ncoal period. This is the great family of the _coniferae_, which although\r\ndiffering in many respects from the highly organised dicotyledons of the\r\npresent day, yet resembled them in some respects, especially in the\r\nformation of an annual ring of woody growth.\r\n\r\nThe conifers are those trees which, as the name would imply, bear their\r\nfruit in the form of cones, such as the fir, larch, cedar, and others.\r\nThe order is one which is familiar to all, not only on account of the\r\ncones they bear, and their sheddings, which in the autumn strew the\r\nground with a soft carpet of long needle-like leaves, but also because of\r\nthe gum-like secretion of resin which is contained in their tissues. Only\r\na few species have been found in the coal-beds, and these, on examination\r\nunder the microscope, have been discovered to be closely related to the\r\naraucarian division of pines, rather than to any of our common firs. The\r\nliving species of this tree is a native of Norfolk Island, in the\r\nPacific, and here it attains a height of 200 feet, with a girth of 30\r\nfeet. From the peculiar arrangement of the ducts in the elongated\r\ncellular tissue of the tree, as seen under the microscope, the fossil\r\nconifers, which exhibit this structure, have been placed in the same\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nThe familiar fossil known to geologists as _Sternbergia_ has now been\r\nshown to be the cast of the central pith of these conifers, amongst which\r\nmay be mentioned _cordaites, araucarites_, and _dadoxylon._. The central\r\ncores had become replaced with inorganic matter after the pith had shrunk\r\nand left the space empty. This shrinkage of the pith is a process which\r\ntakes place in many plants even when living, and instances will at once\r\noccur, in which the stems of various species of shrubs when broken open\r\nexhibit the remains of the shrunken pith, in the shape of thin discs\r\nacross the interval cavity.\r\n\r\nWe might reasonably expect that where we find the remains of fossil\r\nconiferous trees, we should also meet with the cones or fruit which they\r\nbear. And such is the case. In some coal-districts fossil fruits, named\r\n_cardiocarpum_ and _trigonocarpum_, have been found in great quantities,\r\nand these have now been decided by botanists to be the fruits of certain\r\nconifers, allied, not to those which bear hard cones, but to those which\r\nbear solitary fleshy fruits. Sir Charles Lyell referred them to a Chinese\r\ngenus of the yew tribe called _salisburia_. Dawson states that they are\r\nvery similar to both _taxus_ and _salisburia._. They are abundant in some\r\ncoal-measures, and are contained, not only in the coal itself, but also\r\nin the sandstones and shales. The under-clays appear to be devoid of\r\nthem, and this is, of course, exactly what might have been expected,\r\nsince the seeds would remain upon the soil until covered up by vegetable\r\nmatter, but would never form part of the clay soil itself.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the varieties which have been distinguished in the\r\nfamilies of the conifers, calamites, and sigillariae, Sir William Dawson\r\nmakes the following observations: \"I believe that there was a\r\nconsiderably wide range of organisation in _cordaitinae_ as well as in\r\n_calamites_ and _sigillariae_, and that it will eventually be found that\r\nthere were three lines of connection between the higher cryptogams\r\n(flowerless) and the phaenogams (flowering), one leading from the\r\nlycopodes by the _sigillariae_, another leading by the _cordaites_, and\r\nthe third leading from the _equisetums_ by the _calamites_. Still further\r\nback the characters, afterwards separated in the club-mosses,\r\nmare's-tails, and ferns, were united in the _rhizocarps_, or, as some\r\nprefer to call them, the heterosporous _filicinae_.\"\r\n\r\nIn concluding this chapter dealing with the various kinds of plants which\r\nhave been discovered as contributing to the formation of\r\ncoal-measures, it would be as well to say a word or two concerning the\r\nclimate which must have been necessary to permit of the growth of such an\r\nabundance of vegetation. It is at once admitted by all botanists that a\r\nmoist, humid, and warm atmosphere was necessary to account for the\r\nexistence of such an abundance of ferns. The gorgeous waving\r\ntree-ferns which were doubtless an important feature of the landscape,\r\nwould have required a moist heat such as does not now exist in this\r\ncountry, although not necessarily a tropical heat. The magnificent giant\r\nlycopodiums cast into the shade all our living members of that class, the\r\nlargest of which perhaps are those that flourish in New Zealand. In New\r\nZealand, too, are found many species of ferns, both those which are\r\narborescent and those which are of more humble stature. Add to these the\r\nnumerous conifers which are there found, and we shall find that a forest\r\nin that country may represent to a certain extent the appearance\r\npresented by a forest of carboniferous vegetation. The ferns, lycopods,\r\nand pines, however, which appear there, it is but fair to add, are mixed\r\nwith other types allied to more recent forms of vegetation.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for believing that the amount of carbonic acid gas\r\nthen existing in the atmosphere was larger than the quantity which we now\r\nfind, and Professor Tyndall has shown that the effect of this would be to\r\nprevent radiation of heat from the earth. The resulting forms of\r\nvegetation would be such as would be comparable with those which are now\r\nreared in the green-house or conservatory in these latitudes. The gas\r\nwould, in fact, act as a glass roof, extending over the whole world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nA GENERAL VIEW OF THE COAL-BEARING STRATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering the source whence coal is derived, we must be careful to\r\nremember that coal itself is but a minor portion of the whole formation\r\nin which it occurs. The presence of coal has indeed given the name to the\r\nformation, the word \"carboniferous\" meaning \"coal-bearing,\" but in taking\r\na comprehensive view of the position which it occupies in the bowels of\r\nthe earth, it will be necessary to take into consideration the strata in\r\nwhich it is found, and the conditions, so far as are known, under which\r\nthese were deposited.\r\n\r\nGeologically speaking, the Carboniferous formation occurs near the close\r\nof that group of systems which have been classed as \"palaeozoic,\" younger\r\nin point of age than the well known Devonian and Old Red Sandstone\r\nstrata, but older by far than the Oolites, the Wealden, or the Cretaceous\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nIn South Wales the coal-bearing strata have been estimated at between\r\n11,000 and 12,000 feet, yet amongst this enormous thickness of strata,\r\nthe whole of the various coal-seams, if taken together, probably does not\r\namount to more than 120 feet. This great disproportion between the total\r\nthickness and the thickness of coal itself shows itself in every\r\ncoal-field that has been worked, and when a single seam of coal is\r\ndiscovered attaining a thickness of 9 or 10 feet, it is so unusual a\r\nthing in Great Britain as to cause it to be known as the \"nine\" or\r\n\"ten-foot seam,\" as the case may be. Although abroad many seams are found\r\nwhich are of greater thicknesses, yet similarly the other portions of the\r\nformation are proportionately greater.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible therefore to realise completely the significance of\r\nthe coal-beds themselves unless there is also a knowledge of the\r\nremaining constituents of the whole formation. The strata found in the\r\nvarious coal-fields differ considerably amongst themselves in character.\r\nThere are, however, certain well-defined characteristics which find\r\nrepresentation in most of the principal coal-fields, whether British or\r\nEuropean. Professor Hull classifies these carboniferous beds as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  UPPER CARBONIFEROUS.\r\n    _Upper coal-measures._\r\n      Reddish and purple sandstones, red and grey clays  and  shales,\r\n        thin bands of coal, ironstone and limestone, with _spirorbis_\r\n        and fish.\r\n\r\n    _Middle coal-measures._\r\n      Yellow and gray sandstones, blue and black clays and shales,\r\n        bands of coal and ironstone, fossil plants, bivalves\r\n        and fish, occasional marine bands.\r\n\r\n  MIDDLE CARBONIFEROUS.\r\n    _Gannister beds_ or _Lower coal-measures._\r\n      _Millstone grit._ Flagstone series in Ireland.\r\n      _Yoredale beds._ Upper shale series of Ireland.\r\n\r\n  LOWER CARBONIFEROUS.\r\n    _Mountain limestone_.\r\n      _Limestone shale_.\r\n\r\nEach of the three principal divisions has its representative in Scotland,\r\nBelgium, and Ireland, but, unfortunately for the last-named country, the\r\nwhole of the upper coal-measures are there absent. It is from these\r\nmeasures that almost all our commercial coals are obtained.\r\n\r\nThis list of beds might be further curtailed for all practical purposes\r\nof the geologist, and the three great divisions of the system would thus\r\nstand:--\r\n\r\n  Upper Carboniferous, or Coal-measures proper.\r\n\r\n  Millstone grit.\r\n\r\n  Lower Carboniferous, or Mountain limestone.\r\n\r\nIn short, the formation consists of masses of sandstone, shale, limestone\r\nand coal, these also enclosing clays and ironstones, and, in the\r\nlimestone, marbles and veins of the ores of lead, zinc, and antimony, and\r\noccasionally silver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Sigillarian trunks in current-bedded sandstone.\r\nSt Etienne.]\r\n\r\nAs the most apparent of the rocks of the system are sandstone, shale,\r\nlimestone, and coal, it will be necessary to consider how these were\r\ndeposited in the waters of the carboniferous ages, and this we can best\r\ndo by considering the laws under which strata of a similar nature are now\r\nbeing deposited as sedimentary beds.\r\n\r\nA great proportion consists of sandstone. Now sandstone is the result of\r\nsand which has been deposited in large quantities, having become\r\nindurated or hardened by various processes brought to bear upon it. It is\r\nnecessary, therefore, first to ascertain whence came the sand, and\r\nwhether there are any peculiarities in its method of deposition which\r\nwill explain its stratification. It will be noticed at once that it bears\r\na considerable amount of evidence of what is called \"current-bedding,\"\r\nthat is to say, that the strata, instead of being regularly deposited,\r\nexhibit series of wedge-shaped masses, which are constantly thinning out.\r\n\r\nSand and quartz are of the same chemical composition, and in all\r\nprobability the sand of which every sandstone in existence is composed,\r\nappeared on this earth in its first solid form in the shape of quartz.\r\nNow quartz is a comparatively heavy mineral, so also, therefore, will\r\nsand be. It is also very hard, and in these two respects it differs\r\nentirely from another product of sedimentary deposition, namely, mud or\r\nclay, with which we shall have presently to deal when coming to the\r\nshales. Since quartz is a hard mineral it necessarily follows that it\r\nwill suffer, without being greatly affected, a far greater amount of\r\nwearing and knocking about when being transported by the agency of\r\ncurrents and rivers, than will a softer substance, such as clay. An equal\r\namount of this wearing action upon clay will reduce it to a fine\r\nimpalpable silt. The grains of sand, however, will still remain of an\r\nappreciable average size, and where both sand and clay are being\r\ntransported to the sea in one and the same stream, the clay will be\r\ntransported to long distances, whilst the sand, being heavier, bulk for\r\nbulk, and also consisting of grains larger in size than grains of clay,\r\nwill be rapidly deposited, and form beds of sand. Of course, if the\r\ncurrent be a violent one, the sand is transported, not by being held in\r\nsuspension, but rather by being pushed along the bed of the river; such\r\nan action will then tend to cause the sand to become powdered into still\r\nfiner sand.\r\n\r\nWhen a river enters the sea it soon loses its individuality; it becomes\r\nmerged in the body of the ocean, where it loses its current, and where\r\ntherefore it has no power to keep in suspension the sediment which it had\r\nbrought down from the higher lands. When this is the case, the sand borne\r\nin suspension is the first to be deposited, and this accumulates in banks\r\nnear the entrance of the river into the sea. We will suppose, for\r\nillustration, that a small river has become charged with a supply of\r\nsand. As it gradually approaches the sea, and the current loses its\r\nforce, the sand is the more sluggishly carried along, until finally it\r\nfalls to the bottom, and forms a layer of sand there. This layer\r\nincreases in thickness until it causes the depth of water above it to\r\nbecome comparatively shallow. On the shallowing process taking place, the\r\ncurrent will still have a certain, though slighter, hold on the sand in\r\nsuspension, and will transport it yet a little further seaward, when it\r\nwill be thrown down, at the edge of the bank or layer already formed,\r\nthus tending to extend the bank, and to shallow a wider space of\r\nriver-bed.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this action, strata would be formed, shewing\r\nstratification diagonally as well as horizontally, represented in section\r\nas a number of banks which had seemingly been thrown down one above the\r\nother, ending in thin wedge-shaped terminations where the particular\r\nsupply of sediment to which each owed its formation had failed.\r\n\r\nThe masses of sandstone which are found in the carboniferous formation,\r\nexhibit in a large degree these wedge-shaped strata, and we have\r\ntherefore a clue at once, both as to their propinquity to sea and land,\r\nand also as to the manner in which they were formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--_Productus_. Coal-measures.]\r\n\r\nThere is one thing more, too, about them. Just as, in the case we were\r\nconsidering, we could observe that the wedge-shaped strata always pointed\r\naway from the source of the material which formed them, so we can\r\nsimilarly judge that in the carboniferous strata the same deduction holds\r\ngood, that the diagonally-pointing strata were formed in the same way,\r\nand that their thinning out was simply owing to temporary failure of\r\nsediment, made good, however, by a further deposition of strata when the\r\nnext supply was borne down.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely likely, however, that sand in a pure state was always\r\ncarried down by the currents to the sea. Sometimes there would be some\r\nsilt mixed with it. Just as in many parts large masses of almost pure\r\nsandstone have been formed, so in other places shales, or, as they are\r\npopularly known by miners, \"bind,\" have been formed. Shales are formed\r\nfrom the clays which have been carried down by the rivers in the shape of\r\nsilt, but which have since become hardened, and now split up easily into\r\nthin parallel layers. The reader has no doubt often handled a piece of\r\nhard clay when fresh from the quarry, and has remembered how that, when\r\nhe has been breaking it up, in order, perhaps, to excavate a\r\npartially-hidden fossil, it has readily split up in thin flakes or layers\r\nof shaly substance. This exhibits, on a small scale, the chief\r\npeculiarity of the coal shales.\r\n\r\nThe formation of shales will now demand our attention. When a river is\r\ncarrying down with it a quantity of mud or clay, it is transported as a\r\nfine, dusty silt, and when present in quantities, gives the muddy tint to\r\nthe water which is so noticeable. We can very well see how that silt will\r\nbe carried down in greater quantities than sand, since nearly all rivers\r\nin some part of their course will travel through a clayey district, and\r\nfinely-divided clay, being of a very light nature, will be carried\r\nforward whenever a river passes over such a district. And a very slight\r\ncurrent being sufficient to carry it in a state of suspension, it follows\r\nthat it will have little opportunity of falling to the bottom, until, by\r\nsome means or other, the current, which is the means of its conveyance,\r\nbecomes stopped or hindered considerably in its flow.\r\n\r\nWhen the river enters a large body of water, such as the ocean or a lake,\r\nin losing its individuality, it loses also the velocity of its current,\r\nand the silt tends to sink down to the bottom. But being less heavy than\r\nthe sand, about which we have previously spoken, it does not sink all at\r\nonce, but partly with the impetus it has gained, and partly on account of\r\nthe very slight velocity which the current still retains, even after\r\nhaving entered the sea, it will be carried out some distance, and will\r\nthe more gradually sink to the bottom. The deeper the water in which it\r\nfalls the greater the possibility of its drifting farther still, since in\r\nsinking, it would fall, not vertically, but rather as the drops of rain\r\nin a shower when being driven before a gale of wind. Thus we should\r\nnotice that clays and shales would exhibit a regularity and uniformity of\r\ndeposition over a wide area. Currents and tides in the sea or lake would\r\ntend still further to retard deposition, whilst any stoppages in the\r\nsupply of silt which took place would give the former layer time to\r\nconsolidate and harden, and this would assist in giving it that bedded\r\nstructure which is so noticeable in the shales, and which causes it to\r\nsplit up into fine laminae. This uniformity of structure in the shales\r\nover wide areas is a well ascertained characteristic of the coal-shales,\r\nand we may therefore regard the method of their deposition as given here\r\nwith a degree of certainty.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of deposit found among the coal-beds, which is known as\r\nthe \"underclay,\" and this is the most regular of all as to the position\r\nin which it is found. The underclays are found beneath every bed of coal.\r\n\"Warrant,\" \"spavin,\" and \"gannister\" are local names which are sometimes\r\napplied to it, the last being a term used when the clay contains such a\r\nlarge proportion of silicious matter as to become almost like a hard\r\nflinty rock. Sometimes, however, it is a soft clay, at others it is mixed\r\nwith sand, but whatever the composition of the underclays may be, they\r\nalways agree in being unstratified. They also agree in this respect that\r\nthe peculiar fossils known as _stigmariae_ abound in them, and in some\r\ncases to such an extent that the clay is one thickly-matted mass of the\r\nfilamentous rootlets of these fossils. We have seen how these gradually\r\ncame to be recognised as the roots of trees which grew in this age, and\r\nwhose remains have subsequently become metamorphosed into coal, and it is\r\nbut one step farther to come to the conclusion that these underclays are\r\nthe ancient soils in which the plants grew.\r\n\r\nNo sketch of the various beds which go to form the coal-measures would be\r\ncomplete which did not take into account the enormous beds of mountain\r\nlimestone which form the basis of the whole system, and which in thinner\r\nbands are intercalated amongst the upper portion of the system, or the\r\ntrue coal-measures.\r\n\r\nNow, limestones are not formed in the same way in which we have seen that\r\nsandstones and shales are formed. The last two mentioned owe their origin\r\nto their deposition as sediment in seas, estuaries or lakes, but the\r\nmasses of limestone which are found in the various geological formations\r\nowe their origin to causes other than that of sedimentary deposition.\r\n\r\nIn carboniferous times there lived numberless creatures which we know\r\nnowadays as _encrinites_. These, when growing, were fixed to the bed of\r\nthe ocean, and extended upward in the shape of pliant stems composed of\r\nlimestone joints or plates; the stem of each encrinite then expanded at\r\nthe top in the shape of a gorgeous and graceful starfish, possessed of\r\nnumberless and lengthy arms. These encrinites grew in such profusion that\r\nafter death, when the plates of which their stems consisted, became\r\nloosened and scattered over the bed of the sea, they accumulated and\r\nformed solid beds of limestone. Besides the encrinites, there were of\r\ncourse other creatures which were able to create the hard parts of their\r\nstructures by withdrawing lime from the sea, such as _foraminifera_,\r\nshell-fish, and especially corals, so that all these assisted after death\r\nin the accumulation of beds of limestone where they had grown and lived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Encrinite.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Encrinital limestone.]\r\n\r\nThere is one peculiarity in connection with the habitats of the\r\nencrinites and corals which goes some distance in supplying us with a\r\nuseful clue as to the conditions under which this portion of the\r\ncarboniferous formation was formed. These creatures find it a difficult\r\nmatter, as a rule, to live and secrete their calcareous skeleton in any\r\nwater but that which is clear, and free from muddy or sandy sediment.\r\nThey are therefore not found, generally speaking, where the other\r\ndeposits which we have considered, are forming, and, as these are always\r\nfound near the coasts, it follows that the habitats of the creatures\r\nreferred to must be far out at sea where no muddy sediments, borne by\r\nrivers, can reach them. We can therefore safely come to the conclusion\r\nthat the large masses of encrinital limestone, which attain such an\r\nenormous thickness in some places, especially in Ireland, have been\r\nformed far away from the land of the period; we can at the same time draw\r\nthe conclusion that if we find the encrinites broken and snapped asunder,\r\nand the limestone deposits becoming impure through being mingled with a\r\nproportion of clayey or sandy deposits, that we are approaching a\r\ncoast-line where perhaps a river opened out, and where it destroyed the\r\ngrowth of encrinites, mixing with their dead remains the sedimentary\r\ndêbris of the land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Encrinites: various. Mountain limestone.]\r\n\r\nWe have lightly glanced at the circumstances attending the deposition of\r\neach of the principal rocks which form the beds amongst which coal is\r\nfound, and have now to deal with the formation of the coal itself. We\r\nhave already considered the various kinds of plants and trees which have\r\nbeen discovered as contributing their remains to the formation of coal,\r\nand have now to attempt an explanation of how it came to be formed in so\r\nregular a manner over so wide an area.\r\n\r\nEach of the British coal-fields is fairly extensive. The Yorkshire and\r\nDerbyshire coal-fields, together with the Lancashire coal-field, with\r\nwhich they were at one time in geological connection, give us an area of\r\nnearly 1000 square miles, and other British coal-fields show at least\r\nsome hundreds of square miles. And yet, spread over them, we find a\r\nseries of beds of coal which in many cases extend throughout the whole\r\narea with apparent regularity. If we take it, as there seems every reason\r\nto believe was the case, that almost all these coal-fields were not only\r\nbeing formed at the same time, but were in most instances in continuation\r\nwith one another, this regularity of deposition of comparatively narrow\r\nbeds of coal, appears all the more remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe question at once suggests itself, Which of two things is probable?\r\nAre we to believe that all this vegetable matter was brought down by some\r\nmighty river and deposited in its delta, or that the coal-plants grew\r\njust where we now find the coal?\r\n\r\nFormerly it was supposed that coal was formed out of dead leaves and\r\ntrees, the refuse of the vegetation of the land, which had been carried\r\ndown by rivers into the sea and deposited at their mouths, in the same\r\nway that sand and mud, as we have seen, are swept down and deposited. If\r\nthis were so, the extent of the deposits would require a river with an\r\nenormous embouchure, and we should be scarcely warranted in believing\r\nthat such peaceful conditions would there prevail as to allow of the\r\nlayers of coal to be laid down with so little disturbance and with such\r\nregularity over these wide areas. But the great objection to this theory\r\nis, that not only do the remains still retain their perfection of\r\nstructure, but they are comparatively _pure,--i.e.,_ unmixed with\r\nsedimentary depositions of clay or sand. Now, rivers would not bring down\r\nthe dead vegetation alone; their usual burden of sediment would also be\r\ndeposited at their mouths, and thus dead plants, sand, and clay would be\r\nmixed up together in one black shaly or sandy mass, a mixture which would\r\nbe useless for purposes of combustion. The only theory which explained\r\nall the recognised phenomena of the coal-measures was that the plants\r\nforming the coal actually grew where the coal was formed, and where,\r\nindeed, we now find it. When the plants and trees died, their remains\r\nfell to the ground of the forest, and these soon turned to a black,\r\npasty, vegetable mass, the layer thus formed being regularly increased\r\nyear by year by the continual accumulation of fresh carbonaceous matter.\r\nBy this means a bed would be formed with regularity over a wide area; the\r\ncoal would be almost free from an admixture of sandy or clayey sediment,\r\nand probably the rate of formation would be no more rapid in one part of\r\nthe forest than another. Thus there would be everywhere uniformity of\r\nthickness. The warm and humid atmosphere, which it is probable then\r\nexisted, would not only have tended towards the production of an abnormal\r\nvegetation, but would have assisted in the decaying and disintegrating\r\nprocesses which went on amongst the shed leaves and trees.\r\n\r\nWhen at last it was announced as a patent fact that every bed of coal\r\npossessed its underclay, and that trees had been discovered actually\r\nstanding upon their own roots in the clay, there was no room at all for\r\ndoubt that the correct theory had been hit upon--viz., that coal is now\r\nfound just where the trees composing it had grown in the past.\r\n\r\nBut we have more than one coal-seam to account for. We have to explain\r\nthe existence of several layers of coal which have been formed over one\r\nanother on the same spot at successive periods, divided by other periods\r\nwhen shale and sandstones only have been formed.\r\n\r\nA careful estimate of the Lancashire coal-field has been made by\r\nProfessor Hull for the Geological Survey. Of the 7000 feet of\r\ncarboniferous strata here found, spread out over an area of 217 square\r\nmiles, there are on the average eighteen seams of coal.\r\n\r\nThis is only an instance of what is to be found elsewhere. Eighteen\r\ncoal-seams! what does this mean? It means that, during carboniferous\r\ntimes, on no less than eighteen occasions, separate and distinct forests\r\nhave grown on this self-same spot, and that between each of these\r\noccasions changes have taken place which have brought it beneath the\r\nwaters of the ocean, where the sandstones and shales have been formed\r\nwhich divide the coal-seams from each other. We are met here by a\r\nwonderful demonstration of the instability of the surface of the earth,\r\nand we have to do our best to show how the changes of level have been\r\nbrought about, which have allowed of this game of geological see-saw to\r\ntake place between sea and land. Changes of level! Many a hard geological\r\nnut has only been overcome by the application of the principle of changes\r\nof level in the surface of the earth, and in this we shall find a sure\r\nexplanation of the phenomena of the coal-measures.\r\n\r\nGreat changes of the level of the land are undoubtedly taking place even\r\nnow on the earth's surface, and in assuming that similar changes took\r\nplace in carboniferous times, we shall not be assuming the former\r\nexistence of an agent with which we are now unfamiliar. And when we\r\nconsider the thicknesses of sandstone and shale which intervene beneath\r\nthe coal-seams, we can realise to a certain extent the vast lapses of\r\nyears which must have taken place between the existence of each forest;\r\nso that although now an individual passing up a coal-mine shaft may\r\nrapidly pass through the remains of one forest after another, the rise of\r\nthe strata above each forest-bed then was tremendously slow, and the\r\nperiod between the growth of each forest must represent the passing away\r\nof countless ages. Perhaps it would not be too much to say that the\r\nstrata between some of the coal-seams would represent a period not less\r\nthan that between the formation of the few tertiary coals with which we\r\nare acquainted, and a time which is still to us in the far-away future.\r\n\r\nThe actual seams of coal themselves will not yield much information, from\r\nwhich it will be possible to judge of the contour of the landmasses at\r\nthis ancient period. Of one thing we are sure, namely, that at the time\r\neach seam was formed, the spot where it accumulated was dry land. If,\r\ntherefore, the seams which appear one above the other coincide fairly\r\nwell as to their superficial extent, we can conclude that each time the\r\nland was raised above the sea and the forest again grew, the contour of\r\nthe land was very similar. This conclusion will be very useful to go\r\nupon, since whatever decision may be come to as an explanation of one\r\nsuccessive land-period and sea-period on the same spot, will be\r\napplicable to the eighteen or more periods necessary for the completion\r\nof some of the coal-fields.\r\n\r\nWe will therefore look at one of the sandstone masses which occur between\r\nthe coal-seams, and learn what lessons these have to teach us. In\r\nconsidering the formation of strata of sand in the seas around our\r\nriver-mouths, it was seen that, owing to the greater weight of the\r\nparticles of the sand over those of clay, the former the more readily\r\nsank to the bottom, and formed banks not very far away from the land. It\r\nwas seen, too, that each successive deposition of sand formed a\r\nwedge-shaped layer, with the point of the wedge pointing away from the\r\nsource of origin of the sediment, and therefore of the current which\r\nconveyed the sediment. Therefore, if in the coal-measure sandstones the\r\nlayers were found with their wedges all pointing in one direction, we\r\nshould be able to judge that the currents were all from one direction,\r\nand that, therefore, they were formed by a single river. But this is just\r\nwhat we do not find, for instead of it the direction of the wedge-shaped\r\nstrata varies in almost every layer, and the current-bedding has been\r\nbrought about by currents travelling in every direction. Such diverse\r\ncurrent-bedding could only result from the fact that the spot where the\r\nsand was laid down was subject to currents from every direction, and the\r\ninference is that it was well within the sphere of influence of numerous\r\nstreams and rivers, which flowed from every direction. The only condition\r\nof things which would explain this is that the sandstone was originally\r\nformed in a closed sea or large lake, into which numerous rivers flowing\r\nfrom every direction poured their contents.\r\n\r\nNow, in the sandstones, the remains of numerous plants have been found,\r\nbut they do not present the perfect appearance that they do when found in\r\nthe shales; in fact they appear to have suffered a certain amount of\r\ndamage through having drifted some distance. This, together with the fact\r\nthat sandstones are not formed far out at sea, justify the safe\r\nconclusion that the land could not have been far off. Wherever the\r\ncurrent-bedding shows itself in this manner we may be sure we are\r\nexamining a spot from which the land in every direction could not have\r\nbeen at a very great distance, and also that, since the heavy materials\r\nof which sandstone is composed could only be transported by being\r\nimpelled along by currents at the bed of the sea, and that in deep water\r\nsuch currents could not exist, therefore we may safely decide that the\r\nsea into which the rivers fell was a comparatively shallow one.\r\n\r\nAlthough the present coal-fields of England are divided from one another\r\nby patches of other beds, it is probable that some of them were formerly\r\nconnected with others, and a very wide sheet of coal on each occasion was\r\nlaid down. The question arises as to what was the extent of the inland\r\nsea or lake, and did it include the area covered by the coal basins of\r\nScotland and Ireland, of France and Belgium? And if these, why not those\r\nof America and other parts? The deposition of the coal, according to the\r\ntheory here advanced, may as well have been brought about in a series of\r\nlarge inland seas and lakes, as by one large comprehensive sea, and\r\nprobably the former is the more satisfactory explanation of the two. But\r\nthe astonishing part of it is that the changes in the level of the land\r\nmust have been taking place simultaneously over these large areas,\r\nalthough, of course, while one quarter may have been depressed beneath\r\nthe sea, another may have been raised above it.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the question of the contour of the land during the\r\nexistence of the large lakes or inland seas, Professor Hull has prepared,\r\nin his series of maps illustrative of the Palaeo-Geography of the British\r\nIslands, a map showing on incontestible grounds the existence during the\r\ncoal-ages of a great central barrier or ridge of high land stretching\r\nacross from Anglesea, south of Flint, Staffordshire, and Shropshire\r\ncoal-fields, to the eastern coast of Norfolk. He regards the British\r\ncoal-measures as having been laid down in two, or at most three, areas of\r\ndeposition--one south of this ridge, the remainder to the north of it. In\r\nregard to the extent of the former deposits of coal in Ireland, there is\r\nevery probability that the sister island was just as favourably treated\r\nin this respect as Great Britain. Most unfortunately, Ireland has since\r\nsuffered extreme denudation, notably from the great convulsions of nature\r\nat the close of the very period of their deposition, as well as in more\r\nrecent times, resulting in the removal of nearly all the valuable upper\r\ncarboniferous beds, and leaving only the few unimportant\r\ncoal-beds to which reference has been made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--_Cyathophyllum_. Coral in encrinital limestone.]\r\n\r\nWe are unable to believe in the continuity of our coal-beds with those of\r\nAmerica, for the great source of sediment in those times was a continent\r\nsituated on the site of the Atlantic Ocean, and it is owing to this\r\nextensive continent that the forms of _flora_ found in the coal-beds in\r\neach country bear so close a resemblance to one another, and also that\r\nthe encrinital limestone which was formed in the purer depths of the\r\nocean on the east, became mixed with silt, and formed masses of shaly\r\nimpure limestone in the south-western parts of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted that, although we may attribute to upheaval from beneath\r\nthe fact that the bed of the sea became temporarily raised at each period\r\ninto dry land, the deposits of sand or shale would at the same time be\r\ntending to shallow the bed, and this alone would assist the process of\r\nupheaval by bringing the land at least very near to the surface of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nEach upheaval, however, could have been but a temporary arrest of the\r\ngreat movement of crust subsidence which was going on throughout the coal\r\nperiod, so that, at its close, when the last coal forest grew upon the\r\nsurface of the land, there had disappeared, in the case of South Wales, a\r\nthickness of 11,000 feet of material.\r\n\r\nOf the many remarkable things in connection with coal-beds, not the least\r\nis the state of purity in which coal is found. On the floor of each\r\nforest there would be many a streamlet or even small river which would\r\nwend its way to meet the not very distant sea, and it is surprising at\r\nfirst that so little sediment found its way into the coal itself. But\r\nthis was cleverly explained by Sir Charles Lyell, who noticed, on one of\r\nhis visits to America, that the water of the Mississippi, around the rank\r\ngrowths of cypress which form the \"cypress swamps\" at the mouths of that\r\nriver, was highly charged with sediment, but that, having passed through\r\nthe close undergrowth of the swamps, it issued in almost a pure state,\r\nthe sediment which it bore having been filtered out of it and\r\nprecipitated. This very satisfactorily explained how in some places\r\ncarbonaceous matter might be deposited in a perfectly pure state, whilst\r\nin others, where sandstone or shale was actually forming, it might be\r\nimpregnated by coaly matter in such a way as to cause it to be stained\r\nblack. In times of flood sediment would be brought in, even where pure\r\ncoal had been forming, and then we should have a thin \"parting\" of\r\nsandstone or shale, which was formed when the flood was at its height. Or\r\na slight sinking of the land might occur, in which case also the\r\nformation of coal would temporarily cease, and a parting of foreign\r\nmatter would be formed, which, on further upheaval taking place, would\r\nagain give way to another forest growth. Some of the thicker beds have\r\nbeen found presenting this aspect, such as the South Staffordshire\r\nten-yard coal, which in some parts splits up into a dozen or so smaller\r\nbeds, with partings of sediment between them.\r\n\r\nIn the face of the stupendous movements which must have happened in order\r\nto bring about the successive growth of forests one above another on the\r\nsame spot, the question at once arises as to how these movements of the\r\nsolid earth came about, and what was the cause which operated in such a\r\nmanner. We can only judge that, in some way or other, heat, or the\r\nwithdrawal of heat, has been the prime motive power. We can perceive,\r\nfrom what is now going on in some parts of the earth, how great an\r\ninfluence it has had in shaping the land, for volcanoes owe their\r\nactivity to the hidden heat in the earth's interior, and afford us an\r\nidea of the power of which heat is capable in the matter of building up\r\nand destroying continents. No less certain is it that heat is the prime\r\nfactor in those more gradual vertical movements of the land to which we\r\nhave referred elsewhere, but in regard to the exact manner in which it\r\nacts we are very much in the dark. Everybody knows that, in the majority\r\nof instances, material substances of all kinds expand under the influence\r\nof heat, and contract when the source of heat is withdrawn. If we can\r\nimagine movements in the quantity of heat contained in the solid crust,\r\nthe explanation is easy, for if a certain tract of land receive an\r\naccession of heat beneath it, it is certain that the principal effect\r\nwill be an elevation of the land, consequent on the expansion of its\r\nmaterials, with a subsequent depression when the heat beneath the tract\r\nin question becomes gradually lessened. Should the heat be retained for a\r\nlong period, the strata would be so uplifted as to form an anticlinal, or\r\nsaddle-back, and then, should subsequent denudation take place, more\r\nancient strata would be brought to view. It was thus in the instance of\r\nthe tract bounded by the North and South Downs, which were formerly\r\nentirely covered by chalk, and in the instance of the uprising of the\r\ncarboniferous limestone between the coal-fields of Lancashire,\r\nStaffordshire, and Derbyshire.\r\n\r\nHow the heat-waves act, and the laws, if any, which they obey in their\r\nsubterranean movements, we are unable to judge. From the properties which\r\nheat possesses we know that its presence or absence produces marked\r\ndifferences in the positions of the strata of the earth, and from\r\nobservations made in connection with the closing of some volcanoes, and\r\nthe opening up of fresh earth-vents, we have gone a long way towards\r\nestablishing the probability that there are even now slow and ponderous\r\nmovements taking place in the heat stored in the earth's crust, whose\r\neffects are appreciably communicated to the outside of the thin rind of\r\nsolid earth upon which we live.\r\n\r\nOwing to the great igneous and volcanic activity at the close of the\r\ndeposition of the carboniferous system of strata, the coal-measures\r\nexhibit what are known as _faults_ in abundance. The mountain limestone,\r\nwhere it outcrops at the surface, is observed to be much jointed, so much\r\nso that the work of quarrying the limestone is greatly assisted by the\r\njointed structure of the rock. Faults differ from joints in that, whilst\r\nthe strata in the latter are still in relative position on each side of\r\nthe joint, they have in the former slipped out of place. In such a case\r\nthe continuation of a stratum on the opposite side of a fault will be\r\nfound to be depressed, perhaps a thousand feet or more. It will be seen\r\nat once how that, in sinking a new shaft into a coal-seam, the\r\npossibility of an unknown fault has to be brought into consideration,\r\nsince the position of the seam may prove to have been depressed to such\r\nan extent as to cause it to be beyond workable depth. Many seams, on the\r\nother hand, which would have remained altogether out of reach of mining\r\noperations, have been brought within workable depth by a series of\r\n_step-faults_, this being a term applied to a series of parallel faults,\r\nin none of which the amount of down-throw is great.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the down-throw, or the slipping-down of the beds, is\r\nmeasured, vertically, from the point of disappearance of a layer to an\r\nimaginary continuation of the same layer from where it again appears\r\nbeyond the fault. The plane of a fault is usually more or less inclined,\r\nthe amount of the inclination being known as the _hade_ of the fault, and\r\nit is a remarkable characteristic of faults that, as a general rule, they\r\nhade to the down-throw. This will be more clearly understood when it is\r\nexplained that, by its action, a seam of coal, which is subject to\r\nnumerous faults, can never be pierced more than once by one and the same\r\nboring. In mountainous districts, however, there are occasions when the\r\nhade is to the up-throw, and this kind of fault is known as an _inverted\r\nfault_.\r\n\r\nLines of faults extend sometimes for hundreds of miles. The great Pennine\r\nFault of England is 130 miles long, and others extend for much greater\r\ndistances. The surfaces on both sides of a fault are often smooth and\r\nhighly polished by the movement which has taken place in the strata. They\r\nthen show the phenomenon known as _slicken-sides_. Many faults have\r\nbecome filled with crystalline minerals in the form of veins of ore,\r\ndeposited by infiltrating waters percolating through the natural\r\nfissures.\r\n\r\nIn considering the formation and structure of the better-known\r\ncoal-bearing beds of the carboniferous age, we must not lose sight of the\r\nfact that important beds of coal also occur in strata of much more recent\r\ndate. There are important coal-beds in India of Permian age. There are\r\ncoal-beds of Liassic age in South Hungary and in Texas, and of Jurassic\r\nage in Virginia, as well as at Brora in Sutherlandshire; there are coals\r\nof Cretaceous age in Moravia, and valuable Miocene Tertiary coals in\r\nHungary and the Austrian Alps.\r\n\r\nAgain, older than the true carboniferous age, are the Silurian\r\nanthracites of Co. Cavan, and certain Norwegian coals, whilst in New\r\nSouth Wales we are confronted with an assemblage of coal-bearing strata\r\nwhich extend apparently from the Devonian into Mesozoic times.\r\n\r\nStill, the age we have considered more closely has an unrivalled right to\r\nthe title, coal appearing there not merely as an occasional bed, but as a\r\nmarked characteristic of the formation.\r\n\r\nThe types of animal life which are found in this formation are varied,\r\nand although naturally enough they do not excel in number, there are yet\r\nsufficient varieties to show probabilities of the existence of many with\r\nwhich we are unfamiliar. The highest forms yet found, show an advance as\r\ncompared with those from earlier formations, and exhibit amphibian\r\ncharacteristics intermediate between the two great classes of fishes and\r\nreptiles. Numerous specimens proper to the extinct order of\r\n_labyrinthodontia_ have been arranged into at least a score of genera,\r\nthese having been drawn from the coal-measures of Newcastle, Edinburgh,\r\nKilkenny, Saärbruck, Bavaria, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. The\r\n_Archegosaurus,_ which we have figured, and the _Anthracosaurus,_ are\r\nforms which appear to have existed in great numbers in the swamps and\r\nlakes of the age. The fish of the period belong almost entirely to the\r\nancient orders of the ganoids and placoids. Of the ganoids, the great\r\n_megalichthys Hibberti_ ranges throughout the whole of the system.\r\nWonderful accumulations of fish remains are found at the base of the\r\nsystem, in the bone-bed of the Bristol coal-field, as well as in a\r\nsimilar bed at Armagh. Many fishes were armed with powerful conical\r\nteeth, but the majority, like the existing Port Jackson shark, were\r\npossessed of massive palates, suited in some cases for crushing, and in\r\nothers for cutting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--_Archegosaurus minor_. Coal-measures.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--_Psammodus porosus_. Crushing palate of a fish.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--_Orthoceras_. Mountain limestone.]\r\n\r\nIn the mountain limestone we see, of course, the predominance of marine\r\ntypes, encrinital remains forming the greater proportion of the mass.\r\nThere are occasional plant remains which bear evidence of having drifted\r\nfor some distance from the shore. But next to the _encrinites_, the\r\ncorals are the most important and persistent. Corals of most beautiful\r\nforms and capable of giving polished marble-like sections, are in\r\nabundance. _Polyzoa_ are well represented, of which the lace-coral\r\n(_fenestella_) and screw-coral (_archimedopora_) are instances.\r\n_Cephalopoda_ are represented by the _orthoceras_, sometimes five or six\r\nfeet long, and _goniatites_, the forerunner of the familiar _ammonite_.\r\nMany species of brachiopods and lammellibranchs are met with. _Lingula_,\r\nmost persistent throughout all geological time, is abundant in the\r\ncoal-shales, but not in the limestones. _Aviculopecten_ is there abundant\r\nalso. In the mountain limestone the last of the trilobites (_Phillipsia_)\r\nis found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--_Fenestella retipora_. Mountain limestone.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--_Goniatites_. Mountain limestone.]\r\n\r\nWe have evidence of the existence in the forests of a variety of\r\n_centipede_, specimens having been found in the erect stump of a hollow\r\ntree, although the fossil is an extremely rare one. The same may be said\r\nof the only two species of land-snail which have been found connected\r\nwith the coal forests, viz., _pupa vetusta_ and _zonites priscus_, both\r\ndiscovered in the cliffs of Nova Scotia. These are sufficient to\r\ndemonstrate that the fauna of the period had already reached a high stage\r\nof development. In the estuaries of the day, masses of a species of\r\nfreshwater mussel (_anthracosia_) were in existence, and these have left\r\ntheir remains in the shape of extensive beds of shells. They are familiar\r\nto the miner as _mussel-binds_, and are as noticeable a feature of this\r\nlong ago period, as are the aggregations of mussels on every coast  at\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--_Aviculopecten papyraceus_. Coal-shale.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nVARIOUS FORMS OF COAL AND CARBON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering the various forms and combinations into which coal enters,\r\nit is necessary that we should obtain a clear conception of what the\r\nsubstance called \"carbon\" is, and its nature and properties generally,\r\nsince this it is which forms such a large percentage of all kinds of\r\ncoal, and which indeed forms the actual basis of it. In the shape of\r\ncoke, of course, we have a fairly pure form of carbon, and this being\r\nproduced, as we shall see presently, by the driving off of the volatile\r\nor vaporous constituents of coal, we are able to perceive by the residue\r\nhow great a proportion of coal consists of carbon. In fact, the two have\r\nalmost an identical meaning in the popular mind, and the fact that the\r\ngreat masses of strata, in which are contained our principal and most\r\nvaluable seams of coal, are termed \"carboniferous,\" from the Latin\r\n_carbo_, coal, and _fero_, I bear, tends to perpetuate the existence of\r\nthe idea.\r\n\r\nThere is always a certain, though slight, quantity of carbon in the air,\r\nand this remains fairly constant in the open country. Small though it may\r\nbe in proportion to the quantity of pure air in which it is found, it is\r\nyet sufficient to provide the carbon which is necessary to the growth of\r\nvegetable life. Just as some of the animals known popularly as the\r\n_zoophytes_, which are attached during life to rocks beneath the sea, are\r\nfed by means of currents of water which bring their food to them, so the\r\nleaves, which inhale carbon-food during the day through their\r\nunder-surfaces, are provided with it by means of the currents of air\r\nwhich are always circulating around them; and while the fuel is being\r\ntaken in beneath, the heat and light are being received from above, and\r\nthe sun supplies the motive power to digestion.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that it is, within the knowledge of all that, for the\r\norigin of the various seams and beds of coaly combinations which exist in\r\nthe earth's crust, we must look to the vegetable world. If, however, we\r\ncould go so far back in the world's history as the period when our\r\nincandescent orb had only just severed connection with a\r\ngradually-diminishing sun, we should probably find the carbon there, but\r\nlocked up in the bonds of chemical affinities with other elements, and\r\nexisting therewith in a gaseous condition. But, as the solidifying\r\nprocess went on, and as the vegetable world afterwards made its\r\nappearance, the carbon became, so to speak, wrenched from its\r\ncombinations, and being absorbed by trees and plants, finally became\r\ndeposited amongst the ruins of a former vegetable world, and is now\r\npresented to us in the form of coal.\r\n\r\nWe are able to trace the gradual changes through which the pasty mass of\r\ndecaying vegetation passed, in consequence of the fact that we have this\r\nmaterial locked up in various stages of carbonisation, in the strata\r\nbeneath our feet. These we propose to deal with individually, in as\r\nunscientific and untechnical a manner as possible.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, when a mass of vegetable matter commences to decay, it soon\r\nloses its colour. There is no more noticeable proof of this, than that\r\nwhen vitality is withdrawn from the leaves of autumn, they at once\r\ncommence to assume a rusty or an ashen colour. Let the leaves but fall to\r\nthe ground, and be exposed to the early frosts of October, the damp mists\r\nand rains of November, and the rapid change of colour is at once\r\napparent. Trodden under foot, they soon assume a dirty blackish hue, and\r\neven when removed they leave a carbonaceous trace of themselves behind\r\nthem, where they had rested. Another proof of the rapid acquisition of\r\ntheir coaly hue is noticeable in the spring of the year. When the trees\r\nhave burst forth and the buds are rapidly opening, the cases in which the\r\nbuds of such trees as the horse-chestnut have been enclosed will be found\r\ncast off, and strewing the path beneath. Moistened by the rains and the\r\ndamp night-mists, and trodden under foot, these cases assume a jet black\r\nhue, and are to all appearance like coal in the very first stages of\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nBut of course coal is not made up wholly and only of leaves. The branches\r\nof trees, twigs of all sizes, and sometimes whole trunks of trees are\r\nfound, the last often remaining in their upright position, and piercing\r\nthe strata which have been formed above them. At other times they lie\r\nhorizontally on the bed of coal, having been thrown down previously to\r\nthe formation of the shale or sandstone, which now rests upon them. They\r\nare often petrified into solid sandstone themselves, whilst leaving a\r\nrind of coal where formerly was the bark. Although the trunk of a tree\r\nlooks so very different to the leaves which it bears upon its branches,\r\nit is only naturally to be supposed that, as they are both built up after\r\nthe same manner from the juices of the earth and the nourishment in the\r\natmosphere, they would have a similar chemical composition. One very\r\npalpable proof of the carbonaceous character of tree-trunks suggests\r\nitself. Take in your hand a few dead twigs or sticks from which the\r\nleaves have long since dropped; pull away the dead parts of the ivy which\r\nhas been creeping over the summer-house; or clasp a gnarled old monster\r\nof the forest in your arms, and you will quickly find your hand covered\r\nwith a black smut, which is nothing but the result of the first stage\r\nwhich the living plant has made, in its progress towards its condition as\r\ndead coal. But an easy, though rough, chemical proof of the constituents\r\nof wood, can be made by placing a few pieces of wood in a medium-sized\r\ntest-tube, and holding it over a flame. In a short time a certain\r\nquantity of steam will be driven off, next the gaseous constituents of\r\nwood, and finally nothing will be left but a few pieces of black brittle\r\ncharcoal. The process is of course the same in a fire-grate, only that\r\nhere more complete combustion of the wood takes place, owing to its being\r\nintimately exposed to the action of the flames. If we adopt the same\r\nexperiment with some pieces of coal, the action is similar, only that in\r\nthis case the quantity of gases given off is not so great, coal\r\ncontaining a greater proportion of carbon than wood, owing to the fact\r\nthat, during its long burial in the bowels of the earth, it has been\r\nacted upon in such a way as to lose a great part of its volatile\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nFrom processes, therefore, which are to be seen going on around us, it is\r\neasily possible to satisfy ourselves that vegetation will in the long run\r\nundergo such changes as will result in the formation of coal.\r\n\r\nThere are certain parts in most countries, and particularly in Ireland,\r\nwhere masses of vegetation have undergone a still further stage in\r\nmetamorphism, namely, in the well-known and famous peat-bogs. Ireland is\r\n_par excellence_ the land of bogs, some three millions of acres being\r\nsaid to be covered by them, and they yield an almost inexhaustible supply\r\nof peat. One of the peat-bogs near the Shannon is between two and three\r\nmiles in breadth and no less than fifty in length, whilst its depth\r\nvaries from 13 feet to as much as 47 feet. Peat-bogs have in no way\r\nceased to be formed, for at their surfaces the peat-moss grows afresh\r\nevery year; and rushes, horse-tails, and reeds of all descriptions grow\r\nand thrive each year upon the ruins of their ancestors. The formation of\r\nsuch accumulations of decaying vegetation would only be possible where\r\nthe physical conditions of the country allowed of an abundant rainfall,\r\nand depressions in the surface of the land to retain the moisture. Where\r\nextensive deforesting operations have taken place, peat-bogs have often\r\nbeen formed, and many of those in existence in Europe undoubtedly owe\r\ntheir formation to that destruction of forests which went on under the\r\nsway of the Romans. Natural drainage would soon be obstructed by fallen\r\ntrees, and the formation of marsh-land would follow; then with the growth\r\nof marsh-plants and their successive annual decay, a peaty mass would\r\ncollect, which would quickly grow in thickness without let or hindrance.\r\n\r\nIn considering the existence of inland peat-bogs, we must not lose sight\r\nof the fact that there are subterranean forest-beds on various parts of\r\nour coasts, which also rest upon their own beds of peaty matter, and very\r\npossibly, when in the future they are covered up by marine deposits, they\r\nwill have fairly started on their way towards becoming coal.\r\n\r\nPeat-bogs do not wholly consist of peat, and nothing else. The trunks of\r\nsuch trees as the oak, yew, and fir, are often found mingled with the\r\nremains of mosses and reeds, and these often assume a decidedly coaly\r\naspect. From the famous Bog of Allen in Ireland, pieces of oak, generally\r\nknown as \"bog-oak,\" which have been buried for generations in peat, have\r\nbeen excavated. These are as black as any coal can well be, and are\r\nsufficiently hard to allow of their being used in the manufacture of\r\nbrooches and other ornamental objects. Another use to which peat of some\r\nkinds has been put is in the manufacture of yarn, the result being a\r\nmaterial which is said to resemble brown worsted. On digging a ditch to\r\ndrain a part of a bog in Maine, U.S., in which peat to a depth of twenty\r\nfeet had accumulated, a substance similar to cannel coal itself was\r\nfound. As we shall see presently, cannel coal is one of the earliest\r\nstages of true coal, and the discovery proved that under certain\r\nconditions as to heat and pressure, which in this case happened to be\r\npresent, the materials which form peat may also be metamorphosed into\r\ntrue coal.\r\n\r\nDarwin, in his well-known \"Voyage in the _Beagle_\" gives a peculiarly\r\ninteresting description of the condition of the peat-beds in the Chonos\r\nArchipelago, off the Chilian coast, and of their mode of formation. \"In\r\nthese islands,\" he says, \"cryptogamic plants find a most congenial\r\nclimate, and within the forest the number of species and great abundance\r\nof mosses, lichens, and small ferns, is quite extraordinary. In Tierra\r\ndel Fuego every level piece of land is invariably covered by a thick bed\r\nof peat. In the Chonos Archipelago where the nature of the climate more\r\nclosely approaches that of Tierra del Fuego, every patch of level ground\r\nis covered by two species of plants (_Astelia pumila_ and _Donatia\r\nmegellanica_), which by their joint decay compose a thick bed of elastic\r\npeat.\r\n\r\n\"In Tierra del Fuego, above the region of wood-land, the former of these\r\neminently sociable plants is the chief agent in the production of peat.\r\nFresh leaves are always succeeding one to the other round the central\r\ntap-root; the lower ones soon decay, and in tracing a root downwards in\r\nthe peat, the leaves, yet holding their places, can be observed passing\r\nthrough every stage of decomposition, till the whole becomes blended in\r\none confused mass. The Astelia is assisted by a few other plants,--here\r\nand there a small creeping Myrtus (_M. nummularia_), with a woody stem\r\nlike our cranberry and with a sweet berry,--an Empetrum (_E. rubrum_),\r\nlike our heath,--a rush (_Juncus grandiflorus_), are nearly the only ones\r\nthat grow on the swampy surface. These plants, though possessing a very\r\nclose general resemblance to the English species of the same genera, are\r\ndifferent. In the more level parts of the country the surface of the peat\r\nis broken up into little pools of water, which stand at different\r\nheights, and appear as if artificially excavated. Small streams of water,\r\nflowing underground, complete the disorganisation of the vegetable\r\nmatter, and consolidate the whole.\r\n\r\n\"The climate of the southern part of America appears particularly\r\nfavourable to the production of peat. In the Falkland Islands almost\r\nevery kind of plant, even the coarse grass which covers the whole surface\r\nof the land, becomes converted into this substance: scarcely any\r\nsituation checks its growth; some of the beds are as much as twelve feet\r\nthick, and the lower part becomes so solid when dry that it will hardly\r\nburn. Although every plant lends its aid, yet in most parts the Astelia\r\nis the most efficient.\r\n\r\n\"It is rather a singular circumstance, as being so very different from\r\nwhat occurs in Europe, that I nowhere saw moss forming by its decay any\r\nportion of the peat in South America. With respect to the northern limit\r\nat which the climate allows of that peculiar kind of slow decomposition\r\nwhich is necessary for its production, I believe that in Chiloe (lat. 41°\r\nto 42°), although there is much swampy ground, no well characterised peat\r\noccurs; but in the Chonos Islands, three degrees farther southward, we\r\nhave seen that it is abundant. On the eastern coast in La Plata (lat.\r\n35°) I was told by a Spanish resident, who had visited Ireland, that he\r\nhad often sought for this substance, but had never been able to find any.\r\nHe showed me, as the nearest approach to it which he had discovered, a\r\nblack peaty soil, so penetrated with roots as to allow of an extremely\r\nslow and imperfect combustion.\"\r\n\r\nThe next stage in the making of coal is one in which the change has\r\nproceeded a long way from the starting-point. _Lignite_ is the name which\r\nhas been applied to a form of impure coal, which sometimes goes under the\r\nname of \"brown coal.\" It is not a true coal, and is a very long way from\r\nthat final stage to which it must attain ere it takes rank with the most\r\nvaluable of earth's products. From the very commencement, an action has\r\nbeing going on which has caused the amount of the gaseous constituents to\r\nbecome less and less, and which has consequently caused the carbon\r\nremaining behind to occupy an increasingly large proportion of the whole\r\nmass. So, when we arrive at the lignite stage, we find that a\r\nconsiderable quantity of volatile matter has already been parted with,\r\nand that the carbon, which in ordinary living wood is about 50 per cent.\r\nof the whole, has already increased to about 67 per cent. In most\r\nlignites there is, as a rule, a comparatively large proportion of\r\nsulphur, and in such cases it is rendered useless as a domestic fuel. It\r\nhas been used as a fuel in various processes of manufacture, and the\r\nlignite of the well-known Bovey Tracey beds has been utilised in this way\r\nat the neighbouring potteries. As compared with true coal, it is\r\ndistinguished by the abundance of smoke which it produces and the choking\r\nsulphurous fumes which also accompany its combustion, but it is largely\r\nused in Germany as a useful source of paraffin and illuminating oils. In\r\nSilesia, Saxony, and in the district about Bonn, large quantities of\r\nlignite are mined, and used as fuel. Large stores of lignite are known to\r\nexist in the Weald of the south-east of England, and although the mining\r\noperations which were carried on at one time at Heathfield, Bexhill, and\r\nother places, were failures so far as the actual discovery of true coal\r\nwas concerned, yet there can be no doubt as to the future value of the\r\nlignite in these parts, when England's supplies of coal approach\r\nexhaustion, and attention is turned to other directions for the future\r\nsource of her gas and paraffin oils.\r\n\r\nBeside the Bovey Tracey lignitic beds to which we have above referred,\r\nother tertiary clays are found to contain this early promise of coal. The\r\n_eocene_ beds of Brighton are an important instance of a tertiary\r\nlignite, the seam of _surturbrand_, as it is locally called, being a\r\nsomewhat extensive deposit.\r\n\r\nWe have now closely approached to true coal, and the next step which we\r\nshall take will be to consider the varieties in which the black mineral\r\nitself is found. The principal of these varieties are as follows, against\r\neach being placed the average proportion of pure carbon which it\r\ncontains:--\r\n\r\n  Splint or Hard Coal, 83 per cent.;\r\n  Cannel, Candle or Parrott Coal, 84 per cent.;\r\n  Cherry or Soft Coal, 85 per cent.;\r\n  Common Bituminous, or Caking Coal, 88 per cent.;\r\n  Anthracite, Blind Coal, Culm, Glance, or Stone Coal, from South\r\n    Wales, 93 per cent.\r\n\r\nAs far as the gas-making properties of the first three are concerned, the\r\nrelative proportions of carbon and volatile products are much the same.\r\nEverybody knows a piece of cannel coal when it is seen, how it appears\r\nalmost to have been once in a molten condition, and how it breaks with a\r\nconchoidal fracture, as opposed to the cleavage of bituminous coal into\r\nthin layers; and, most apparent and most noticeable of all, how it does\r\nnot soil the hands after the manner of ordinary coal. It is at times so\r\ndense and compact that it has been fashioned into ornaments, and is\r\ncapable of receiving a polish like jet. From the large percentage of\r\nvolatile products which it contains, it is greatly used in gasworks.\r\n\r\nCaking coal and the varieties of coal which exist between it and\r\nanthracite, are familiar to every householder; the more it approaches the\r\ncomposition of the latter the more difficult it is to get it to burn, but\r\nwhen at last fairly alight it gives out great heat, and what is more\r\nimportant, a less quantity of volatile constituents in the shape of gas,\r\nsmoke, ammonia, ash and sulphurous acid. For this reason it has been\r\nproposed to compel consumers to adopt anthracite as _the_ domestic coal\r\nby Act of Parliament. Certainly by this means the amount of impurities in\r\nthe air might be appreciably lessened, but as it would involve the\r\nreconstruction of some millions of fire-places, and an increase in price\r\nin consequence of the general demand for it, it is not likely that a\r\ngovernment would be so rash as to attempt to pass such a measure; even if\r\npassed, it would probably soon become as dead and obsolete and impotent\r\nas those many laws with which our ancestors attempted, first to arrest,\r\nand then to curb the growth in the use of coal of any sort. Anthracite is\r\nnot a \"homely\" coal. If we use it alone it will not give us that bright\r\nand cheerful blaze which English-speaking people like to obtain from\r\ntheir fires.\r\n\r\nIt is a significant fact, and one which proves that the various kinds of\r\ncoal which are found are nothing but stages begotten by different degrees\r\nof disentanglement of the contained gases, that where, as in some parts,\r\na mass of basalt has come into contact with ordinary bituminous coal, the\r\ncoal has assumed the character of anthracite, whilst the change has in\r\nsome instances gone so far as to convert the anthracite into graphite.\r\nThe basalt, which is one of the igneous rocks, has been erupted into the\r\ncoal-seam in a state of fusion, and the heat contained in it has been\r\nsufficient to cause the disentanglement of the gases, the extraction of\r\nwhich from the coal brings about the condition of anthracite and\r\ngraphite.\r\n\r\nThe mention of graphite brings us to the next stage. Graphite, plumbago,\r\nor, as it is more commonly called, black-lead, which, we may say in\r\npassing, has nothing of lead about it at all, is best known in the shape\r\nof that very useful and cosmopolitan article, the black-lead pencil. This\r\nis even purer carbon than anthracite, not more than 5 per cent. of ash\r\nand other impurities being present. It is well-known by its grey metallic\r\nlustre; the chemist uses it mixed with fire-clay to make his crucibles;\r\nthe engineer uses it, finely powdered, to lubricate his machinery; the\r\nhouse-keeper uses it to \"black-lead\" her stoves to prevent them from\r\nrusting. An imperfect graphite is found inside some of the hottest\r\nretorts from which gas is distilled, and this is used as the negative\r\nelement in zinc and carbon electricity-making cells, whilst its use as\r\nthe electrodes or carbons of the arc-lamp is becoming more and more\r\nwidely adopted, as installations of electric light become more general.\r\n\r\nOne great source of true graphite for many years was the famous mine at\r\nBorrowdale, in Cumberland, but this is now almost exhausted. The vein lay\r\nbetween strata of slate, and was from eight to nine feet thick. As much\r\nas £100,000 is said to have been realised from it in one year. Extensive\r\nsupplies of graphite are found in rocks of the Laurentian age in Canada.\r\nIn this formation nothing which can undoubtedly be classed as organic has\r\nyet been discovered. Life at this early period must have found its home\r\nin low and humble forms, and if the _eozoön_ of Dawson, which has been\r\nthought to represent the earliest type of life, turns out after all not\r\nto be organic, but only a deceptive appearance assumed by certain of the\r\nstrata, we at least know that it must have been in similarly humble forms\r\nthat life, if it existed at all, did then exist. We can scarcely,\r\ntherefore, expect that the vegetable world had made any great advance in\r\ncomplexity of organism at this time, otherwise the supplies of graphite\r\nor plumbago which are found in the formation, would be attributed to\r\ndense forest growths, acted upon, after death, in a similar manner to\r\nthat which awaited the vegetation which, ages after, went to form beds of\r\ncoal. At present we know of no source of carbon except through the\r\nintervention and the chemical action of plants. Like iron, carbon is\r\nseldom found on the earth except in combination. If there were no growth\r\nof vegetation at this far-away period to give rise to these deposits of\r\ngraphite, we are compelled to ask ourselves whether, perchance, there did\r\nnot then exist conditions of which we are not now cognisant on the earth,\r\nand which allowed graphite to be formed without assistance from the\r\nvegetable kingdom. At present, however, science is in the dark as to any\r\nother process of its formation, and we are left to assume that the\r\nvegetable growth of the time was enormous in quantity, although there is\r\nnothing to show the kind of vegetation, whether humble mosses or tall\r\nforest trees, which went to constitute the masses of graphite. Geologists\r\nwill agree that this is no small assumption to make, since, if true, it\r\nmay show that there was an abundance of vegetation at a time when animal\r\nlife was hidden in one or more very obscure forms, one only of which has\r\nso far been detected, and whose very identity is strongly doubted by\r\nnearly all competent judges. At the same time there _may_ have been an\r\nabundance of both animal and vegetable life at the time. We must not\r\nforget that it is a well-ascertained fact that in later ages, the minute\r\nseed-spores of forest trees were in such abundance as to form important\r\nseams of coal in the true carboniferous era, the trees which gave birth\r\nto them being now classed amongst the humble _cryptogams_, the ferns, and\r\nclub-mosses, &c. The graphite of Laurentian age may not improbably have\r\nbeen caused by deposits of minute portions of similar lowly specimens of\r\nvegetable life, and if the _eozoön_ the \"dawn-animalcule,\" does represent\r\nthe animal life of the time, life whose types were too minute to leave\r\nundoubted traces of their existence, both animal life and vegetable life\r\nmay be looked upon as existing side by side in extremely humble forms,\r\nneither as yet having taken an undoubted step forward in advance of the\r\nother in respect to complexity of organism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 30.--_Lepidodendron_. Portion of Sandstone stem after\r\nremoval of bark of a giant club-moss]\r\n\r\nThere is but one more form of carbon with which we have to deal in\r\nrunning through the series. We have seen that coal is not the _summum\r\nbonum_ of the series. Other transformations take place after the stage of\r\ncoal is reached, which, by the continued disentanglement of gases,\r\nfinally bring about the plumbago stage.\r\n\r\nWhat the action is which transforms plumbago or some other form of carbon\r\ninto the condition of a diamond cannot be stated. Diamond is the purest\r\nform of carbon found in nature. It is a beautiful object, alike from the\r\nresults of its powers of refraction, as also from the form into which its\r\ncarbon has been crystallised. How Nature, in her wonderful laboratory,\r\nhas precipitated the diamond, with its wonderful powers of spectrum\r\nanalysis, we cannot say with certainty. Certain chemists have, at a great\r\nexpense, produced crystals which, in every respect, stand the tests of\r\ntrue diamonds; but the process of their production at a great expense has\r\nin no way diminished the value of the natural product.\r\n\r\nThe process by which artificial diamonds have been produced is so\r\ninteresting, and the subject may prove to be of so great importance, that\r\na few remarks upon the process may not be unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of the great French chemist, Dumas, and others,\r\nsatisfactorily proved the fact, which has ever since been considered\r\nthoroughly established, that the diamond is nothing but carbon\r\ncrystallised in nearly a pure state, and many chemists have since been\r\nengaged in the hitherto futile endeavour to turn ordinary carbon into the\r\ntrue diamond.\r\n\r\nDespretz at one time considered that he had discovered the process, which\r\nconsisted in his case of submitting a piece of charcoal to the action of\r\nan electric battery, having in his mind the similar process of\r\nelectrolysis, by which water is divided up into the two gases, hydrogen\r\nand oxygen. He obtained a microscopic deposit on the poles of the\r\nbattery, which he pronounced to be diamond dust, but which, a long time\r\nafter, was proved to be nothing but graphite in a crystallised state.\r\nThis was, however, certainly a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThe honour of first accomplishing the task fell to Mr Hannay, of Glasgow,\r\nwho succeeded in producing very small but comparatively soft diamonds, by\r\nheating lampblack under great pressure, in company with one or two other\r\ningredients. The process was a costly one, and beyond being a great\r\nscientific feat, the discovery led to little result.\r\n\r\nA young French chemist, M. Henri Moissau, has since come to the front,\r\nand the diamonds which he has produced have stood every test for the true\r\ndiamond to which they could be subjected; above all, the density of the\r\nproduct is 3.5, _i.e._, that of the diamond, that of graphite reaching 2\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nHe recognised that in all diamonds which he had consumed--and he consumed\r\nsome £150 worth in order to assure himself of the fact--there were always\r\ntraces of iron in their composition. He saw that iron in fusion, like\r\nother metals, always dissolves a certain quantity of carbon. Might it not\r\nbe that molten iron, cooling in the presence of carbon, deep in volcanic\r\ndepths where there was little scope for the iron to expand in assuming\r\nthe solid form, would exert such tremendous pressure upon the particles\r\nof carbon which it absorbed, that these would assume the crystalline\r\nstate?\r\n\r\nHe packed a cylinder of soft iron with the carbon of sugar, and placed\r\nthe whole in a crucible filled with molten iron, which was raised to a\r\ntemperature of 3000° by means of an electric furnace. The soft cylinder\r\nmelted, and dissolved a large portion of the carbon. The crucible was\r\nthrown into water, and a mass of solid iron was formed. It was allowed\r\nfurther to cool in the open air, but the expansion which the iron would\r\nhave undergone on cooling, was checked by the crucible which contained\r\nit. The result was a tremendous pressure, during which the carbon, which\r\nwas still dissolved, was crystallised into minute diamonds.\r\n\r\nThese showed themselves as minute points which were easily separable from\r\nthe mass by the action of acids. Thus the wonderful transformation from\r\nsugar to the diamond was accomplished.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that iron, silver, and water, alone possess the\r\npeculiar property of expanding when passing from the liquid to the solid\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe diamonds so obtained were of both kinds. The particles of white\r\ndiamond resembled in every respect the true brilliant. But there was also\r\nan appreciable quantity of the variety known as the \"black diamond.\"\r\nThese diamonds seem to approximate more closely to carbon as we are most\r\nfamiliar with it. They are not considered as of such value as the\r\ntransparent form, but they are still of considerable commercial value.\r\nThe _carbonado_, as this kind is called, possesses so great a degree of\r\nhardness that by means of it it is possible to bore through the hardest\r\nrocks. The diamond drill, used for boring purposes, is furnished around\r\nthe outer edge of the cylinder of the \"boring bit,\" as it is called, with\r\nperhaps a dozen black diamonds, together with another row of Brazilian\r\ndiamonds on the inside. By the rotation of the boring tool the sharp\r\nedges of the diamonds cut their way through rocks of all degrees of\r\nhardness, leaving a core of the rock cut through, in the centre of the\r\ncylindrical drill. It is found that the durability of the natural edge of\r\nthe diamond is far greater than that of the edge caused by _artificial_\r\ncutting and trimming. The cutting of a pane of glass by means of a ring\r\nset with an artificially-cut diamond, cannot therefore be done without\r\ninjuring to a slight extent the edge of the stone.\r\n\r\nThe diamond is the hardest of all known substances, leaving a scratch on\r\nany substance across which it may be drawn. Yet it is one whose form can\r\nbe changed, and whose hardness can be completely destroyed, by the simple\r\nprocess of combustion. It can be deprived of its high lustre, and of its\r\npower of breaking up by refraction the light of the sun into the various\r\ntints of the solar spectrum, simply by heating it to a red heat, and then\r\nplunging it into a jar of oxygen gas. It immediately expands, changes\r\ninto a coky mass, and burns away. The product left behind is a mixture of\r\ncarbon and oxygen, in the proportions in which it is met with in\r\ncarbonic-anhydride, or, carbonic acid gas deprived of its water. This is\r\nindeed a strange transformation, from the most valuable of all our\r\nprecious stones to a compound which is the same in chemical constituents\r\nas the poisonous gas which we and all animals exhale. But there is this\r\nto be said. Probably in the far-away days when the diamond began to be\r\nformed, the tree or other vegetable product which was its far-removed\r\nancestor abstracted carbonic acid gas from the atmosphere, just as do our\r\nplants in the present day. By this means it obtained the carbon wherewith\r\nto build up its tissues. Thus the combustion of the diamond into\r\ncarbonic-anhydride now is, after all, only a return to the same compound\r\nout of which it was originally formed. How it was formed is a secret:\r\nprobably the time occupied in the formation of the diamond may be counted\r\nby centuries, but the time of its re-transformation into a mass of coky\r\nmatter is but the work of seconds!\r\n\r\nThere is another form of carbon which was formerly of much greater\r\nimportance than it is now, and which, although not a natural product, is\r\nyet deserving of some notice here. Charcoal is the substance referred to.\r\n\r\nIn early days the word \"coal,\" or, as it was also spelt, \"cole,\" was\r\napplied to any substance which was used as fuel; hence we have a\r\nreference in the Bible to a \"fire of coals,\" so translated when the\r\nmeaning to be conveyed was probably not coal as we know it. Wood was\r\nformerly known as coal, whilst charred wood received the name of\r\ncharred-coal, which was soon corrupted into charcoal. The\r\ncharcoal-burners of years gone by were a far more flourishing community\r\nthan they are now. When the old baronial halls and country-seats depended\r\non them for the basis of their fuel, and the log was a more frequent\r\noccupant of the fire-grate than now, these occupiers of midforest were a\r\npeople of some importance.\r\n\r\nWe must not overlook the fact that there is another form of charcoal,\r\nnamely, animal charcoal or bone-black. This can be obtained by heating\r\nbones to redness in closed iron vessels. In the refining of raw sugar the\r\ndiscoloration of the syrup is brought about by filtering it through\r\nanimal-charcoal; by this means the syrup is rendered colourless.\r\n\r\nWhen properly prepared, charcoal exhibits very distinctly the rings of\r\nannual growth which may have characterised the wood from which it was\r\nformed. It is very light in consequence of its porous nature, and it is\r\nwonderfully indestructible.\r\n\r\nBut its greatest, because it is its most useful property, is undoubtedly\r\nthe power which it has of absorbing great quantities of gas into itself.\r\nIt is in fact what may be termed an all-round purifier. It is a\r\ndeodoriser, a disinfectant, and a decoloriser. It is an absorbent of bad\r\nodours, and partially removes the smell from tainted meat. It has been\r\nused when offensive manures have been spread over soils, with the same\r\nobject in view, and its use for the purification of water is well known\r\nto all users of filters. Some idea of its power as a disinfectant may be\r\ngained by the fact that one volume of wood-charcoal will absorb no less\r\nthan 90 volumes of ammonia, 35 volumes of carbonic anhydride, and 65\r\nvolumes of sulphurous anhydride.\r\n\r\nOther forms of carbon which are well-known are (1) coke, the residue left\r\nwhen coal has been subjected to a great heat in a closed retort, but from\r\nwhich all the bye-products of coal have been allowed to escape; (2) soot\r\nand lamp-black, the former of which is useful as a manure in consequence\r\nof ammonia being present in it, whilst the latter is a specially prepared\r\nsoot, and is used in the manufacture of Indian ink and printers' ink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE COAL-MINE AND ITS DANGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat strange to think that where once existed the solitudes of\r\nan ancient carboniferous forest now is the site of a busy underground\r\ntown. For a town it really is. The various roads and passages which are\r\ncut through the solid coal as excavation of a coal-mine proceeds,\r\nrepresent to a stranger all the intricacies of a well-planned town. Nor\r\nis the extent of these underground towns a thing to be despised. There is\r\nan old pit near Newcastle which contains not less than fifty miles of\r\npassages. Other pits there are whose main thoroughfares in a direct line\r\nare not less than four or five miles in length, and this, it must be\r\nborne in mind, is the result of excavation wrought by human hands and\r\nhuman labour.\r\n\r\nSo great an extent of passages necessarily requires some special means of\r\nkeeping the air within it in a pure state, such as will render it fit for\r\nthe workers to breathe. The further one would go from the main\r\nthoroughfare in such a mine, the less likely one would be to find air of\r\nsufficient purity for the purpose. It is as a consequence necessary to\r\ntake some special steps to provide an efficient system of ventilation\r\nthroughout the mine. This is effectually done by two shafts, called\r\nrespectively the downcast and the upcast shaft. A shaft is in reality a\r\nvery deep well, and may be circular, rectangular or oval in form. In\r\norder to keep out water which may be struck in passing through the\r\nvarious strata, it is protected by plank or wood tubbing, or the shaft is\r\nbricked over, or sometimes even cast-iron segments are sunk. In many\r\nshafts which, owing to their great depth, pass through strata of every\r\ndegree of looseness or viscosity, all three methods are utilised in turn.\r\nIn Westphalia, where coal is worked beneath strata of more recent\r\ngeological age, narrow shafts have been, in many cases, sunk by means of\r\nboring apparatus, in preference to the usual process of excavation, and\r\nthe practice has since been adopted in South Wales. In England the usual\r\nform of the pit is circular, but elliptical and rectangular pits are also\r\nin use. On the Continent polygonal-shaped shafts are not uncommon, all of\r\nthem, of whatever shape, being constructed with a view to resist the\r\ngreat pressure exerted by the rock around.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Engine-House and Buildings at head of a\r\nCoal-Pit.]\r\n\r\nIf there be one of these shafts at one end of the mine, and another at a\r\nremote distance from it, a movement of the air will at once begin, and a\r\nrough kind of ventilation will ensue. This is, however, quite\r\ninsufficient to provide the necessary quantity of air for inhalation by\r\nthe army of workers in the coal-mine, for the current thus set up does\r\nnot even provide sufficient force to remove the effete air and impurities\r\nwhich accumulate from hundreds of perspiring human bodies.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore necessary to introduce some artificial means, by which a\r\nstrong and regular current shall pass down one shaft, through the mine in\r\nall its workings, and out at the other shaft. This is accomplished in\r\nvarious ways. It took many years before those interested in mines came\r\nthoroughly to understand how properly to secure ventilation, and in\r\nbygone days the system was so thoroughly bad that a tremendous amount of\r\nsickness prevailed amongst the miners, owing to the poisonous effects of\r\nbreathing the same air over and over again, charged, as it was, with more\r\nor less of the gases given off by the coal itself. Now, those miners who\r\ndo so great a part in furnishing the means of warming our houses in\r\nwinter, have the best contrivances which can be devised to furnish them\r\nwith an ever-flowing current of fresh air.\r\n\r\nAmongst the various mechanical appliances which have been used to ensure\r\nventilation may be mentioned pumps, fans, and pneumatic screws. There is,\r\nas we have said, a certain, though slight, movement of the air in the two\r\ncolumns which constitute the upcast and the downcast shafts, but in order\r\nthat a current may flow which shall be equal to the necessities of the\r\nminers, some means are necessary, by which this condition of almost\r\nequilibrium shall be considerably disturbed, and a current created which\r\nshall sweep all foul gases before it. One plan was to force fresh air\r\ninto the downcast, which should in a sense push the foetid air away by\r\nthe upcast. Another was to exhaust the upcast, and so draw the gases in\r\nthe train of the exhausted air. In other cases the plan was adopted of\r\nproviding a continual falling of water down the downcast shaft.\r\n\r\nThese various plans have almost all given way to that which is the most\r\nserviceable of all, namely, the plan of having an immense furnace\r\nconstantly burning in a specially-constructed chamber at the bottom of\r\nthe upcast. By this means the column of air above it becomes rarefied\r\nunder the heat, and ascends, whilst the cooler air from the downcast\r\nrushes in and spreads itself in all directions whence the bad air has\r\nalready been drawn. On the other hand, to so great a state of perfection\r\nhave ventilating fans been brought, that one was recently erected which\r\nwould be capable of changing the air of Westminster Hall thirty times in\r\none hour.\r\n\r\nHaving procured a current of sufficient power, it will be at once\r\nunderstood that, if left to its own will, it would take the nearest path\r\nwhich might lie between its entrance and its exit, and, in this way,\r\nventilating the principal street only, would leave all the many\r\noff-shoots from it undisturbed. It is consequently manipulated by means\r\nof barriers and tight-fitting doors, in such a way that the current is\r\nbound in turn to traverse every portion of the mine. A large number of\r\nboys, known as trappers, are employed in opening the doors to all comers,\r\nand in carefully closing the doors immediately after they have passed, in\r\norder that the current may not circulate through passages along which it\r\nis not intended that it should pass.\r\n\r\nThe greatest dangers which await the miners are those which result, in\r\nthe form of terrible explosions, from the presence of inflammable gases\r\nin the mines. The great walls of coal which bound the passages in mines\r\nare constantly exuding supplies of gas into the air. When a bank of coal\r\nis brought down by an artificial explosion, by dynamite, by lime\r\ncartridges, or by some other agency, large quantities of gas are\r\nsometimes disengaged, and not only is this highly detrimental to the\r\nhealth of the miners, if not carried away by proper ventilation, but it\r\nconstitutes a constant danger which may at any time cause an explosion\r\nwhen a naked light is brought into contact with it. Fire-damp may be\r\nsometimes heard issuing from fiery seams with a peculiar hissing sound.\r\nIf the volume be great, the gas forms what is called a _blower_, and this\r\noften happens in the neighbourhood of a fault. When coal is brought down\r\nin any large volume, the blowers which commence may be exhausted in a few\r\nmoments. Others, however, have been known to last for years, this being\r\nthe case at Wallsend, where the blower gave off 120 feet of gas per\r\nminute. In such cases the gas is usually conveyed in pipes to a place\r\nwhere it can be burned in safety.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of coal-mining the explosions caused by this gas soon\r\nreceived the serious attention of the scientific men of the age. In the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society_ we find a record of a\r\ngas explosion in 1677. The amusing part of such records was that the\r\nexplosions were ascribed by the miners to supernatural agencies. Little\r\nattention seemed to have been paid to the fact, which has since so\r\nthoroughly been established, that the explosions were caused by\r\naccumulations of gas, mixed in certain proportions with air. As a\r\nconsequence, tallow candles with an exposed flame were freely used,\r\nespecially in Britain. These were placed in niches in the workings, where\r\nthey would give to the pitman the greatest amount of light. Previous to\r\nthe introduction of the safety-lamp, workings were tested before the men\r\nentered them, by \"trying the candle\". Owing to the specific gravity of\r\nfire-damp (.555) being less than that of air, it always finds a lodgement\r\nat the roofs of the workings, so that, to test the condition of the air,\r\nit was necessary to steadily raise the candle to the roof at certain\r\nplaces in the passages, and watch carefully the action of the flame. The\r\npresence of fire-damp would be shown by the flame assuming a blue colour,\r\nand by its elongation; the presence of other gases could be detected by\r\nan experienced man by certain peculiarities in the tint of the flame.\r\nThis testing with the open flame has almost entirely ceased since the\r\nintroduction of the perfected Davy lamp.\r\n\r\nThe use of candles for illumination soon gave place in most of the large\r\ncollieries to the introduction of small oil-lamps. In the less fiery\r\nmines on the Continent, oil-lamps of the well-known Etruscan pattern are\r\nstill in use, whilst small metal lamps, which can conveniently be\r\nattached to the cap of the worker, occasionally find favour in the\r\nshallower Scotch mines. These lamps are very useful in getting the coal\r\nfrom the thinner seams, where progress has to be made on the hands and\r\nfeet. At the close of the last century, as workings began to be carried\r\ndeeper, and coal was obtained from places more and more infested with\r\nfire-damp, it soon came to be realised that the old methods of\r\nillumination would have to be replaced by others of a safer nature.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that mere red heat is insufficient in itself to ignite\r\nfire-damp, actual contact with flame being necessary for this purpose.\r\nBearing this in mind, Spedding, the discoverer of the fact, invented what\r\nis known as the \"steel-mill\" for illuminating purposes. In this a toothed\r\nwheel was made to play upon a piece of steel, the sparks thus caused\r\nbeing sufficient to give a moderate amount of illumination. It was found,\r\nhowever, that this method was not always trustworthy, and lamps were\r\nintroduced by Humboldt in 1796, and by Clanny in 1806. In these lamps the\r\nair which fed the flame was isolated from the air of the mine by having\r\nto bubble through a liquid. Many miners were not, however, provided with\r\nthese lamps, and the risks attending naked lights went on as merrily as\r\never.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid explosions in mines which were known to give off large\r\nquantities of gas, \"fiery\" pits as they are called, Sir Humphrey Davy in\r\n1815 invented his safety lamp, the principle of which can be stated in a\r\nfew words.\r\n\r\nIf a piece of fine wire gauze be held over a gas-jet before it is lit,\r\nand the gas be then turned on, it can be lit above the gauze, but the\r\nflame will not pass downwards towards the source of the gas; at least,\r\nnot until the gauze has become over-heated. The metallic gauze so rapidly\r\nconducts away the heat, that the temperature of the gas beneath the gauze\r\nis unable to arrive at the point of ignition. In the safety-lamp the\r\nlittle oil-lamp is placed in a circular funnel of fine gauze, which\r\nprevents the flame from passing through it to any explosive gas that may\r\nbe floating about outside, but at the same time allows the rays of light\r\nto pass through readily. Sir Humphrey Davy, in introducing his lamp,\r\ncautioned the miners against exposing it to a rapid current of air, which\r\nwould operate in such a way as to force the flame through the gauze, and\r\nalso against allowing the gauze to become red-hot. In order to minimise,\r\nas far as possible, the necessity of such caution the lamp has been\r\nconsiderably modified since first invented, the speed of the ventilating\r\ncurrents not now allowing of the use of the simple Davy lamp, but the\r\nprinciple is the same.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of Sir Humphrey Davy's experiments, he found that\r\nwhen fire-damp was diluted with 85 per cent. of air, and any less\r\nproportion, it simply ignited without explosion. With between 85 per\r\ncent. and 89 per cent. of air, fire-damp assumed its most explosive form,\r\nbut afterwards decreased in explosiveness, until with 94-1/4 per cent. of\r\nair it again simply ignited without explosion. With between 11 and 12 per\r\ncent. of fire-damp the mixture was most dangerous. Pure fire-damp itself,\r\ntherefore, is not dangerous, so that when a small quantity enters the\r\ngauze which surrounds the Davy lamp, it simply burns with its\r\ncharacteristic blue flame, but at the same time gives the miner due\r\nnotice of the danger which he was running.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Gas Jet and Davy Lamp.]\r\n\r\nWith the  complicated improvements which have since been made in the Davy\r\nlamp, a state of almost absolute safety can be guaranteed, but still from\r\ntime to time explosions are reported. Of the cause of many we are\r\nabsolutely ignorant, but occasionally a light is thrown upon their origin\r\nby a paragraph appearing in a daily paper. Two men are charged before the\r\nmagistrates with being in the possession of keys used exclusively for\r\nunlocking their miners' safety-lamps. There is no defence. These men know\r\nthat they carry their lives in their hands, yet will risk their own and\r\nthose of hundreds of others, in order that they may be able to light\r\ntheir pipes by means of their safety-lamps. Sometimes in an unexpected\r\nmoment there is a great dislodgement of coal, and a tremendous quantity\r\nof gas is set free, which may be sufficient to foul the passages for some\r\ndistance around. The introduction or exposure of a naked light for even\r\nso much as a second is sufficient to cause explosion of the mass; doors\r\nare blown down, props and tubbing are charred up, and the volume of\r\nsmoke, rushing up by the nearest shaft and overthrowing the engine-house\r\nand other structures at the mouth, conveys its own sad message to those\r\nat the surface, of the dreadful catastrophe that has happened below.\r\nPerhaps all that remains of some of the workers consists of charred and\r\nscorched bodies, scarcely recognisable as human beings. Others escape\r\nwith scorched arms or legs, and singed hair, to tell the terrible tale to\r\nthose who were more fortunately absent; to speak of their own sufferings\r\nwhen, after having escaped the worst effects of the explosion, they\r\nencountered the asphyxiating rush of the after-damp or choke-damp, which\r\nhad been caused by the combustion of the fire-damp. \"Choke-damp\" in very\r\ntruth it is, for it is principally composed of our old acquaintance\r\ncarbonic acid gas (carbon dioxide), which is well known as a\r\nnon-supporter of combustion and as an asphyxiator of animal life.\r\n\r\nIt seems a terrible thing that on occasions the workings and walls\r\nthemselves of a coal-mine catch fire and burn incessantly. Yet such is\r\nthe case. Years ago this happened in the case of an old colliery near\r\nDudley, at the surface of which, by means of the heat and steam thus\r\nafforded, early potatoes for the London market, we are told, were grown;\r\nand it was no unusual thing to see the smoke emerging from cracks and\r\ncrevices in the rocks in the vicinity of the town.\r\n\r\nFrom fire on the one hand, we pass, on the other, to the danger which\r\nawaits miners from a sudden inrush of water. During the great coal strike\r\nof 1893, certain mines became unworkable in consequence of the quantity\r\nof water which flooded the mines, and which, continually passing along\r\nthe natural fractures in the earth's crust, is always ready to find a\r\nstorage reservoir in the workings of a coal-mine. This is a difficulty\r\nwhich is always experienced in the sinking of shafts, and the shutting\r\noff of water engages the best efforts of mining engineers.\r\n\r\nAdded to these various dangers which exist in the coal-mine, we must not\r\nomit to notice those accidents that are continually being caused by the\r\nfalling-in of roofs or of walls, from the falling of insecure timber, or\r\nof what are known as \"coal-pipes\" or \"bell-moulds.\" Then, again, every\r\nman that enters the mine trusts his life to the cage by which he descends\r\nto his labour, and shaft accidents are not infrequent.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the number of deaths from colliery accidents\r\nfor a period of ten years, compiled by a Government inspector, and from\r\nthis it will be seen that those resulting from falling roofs number\r\nconsiderably more than one-third of the whole.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n|         Causes of Death.              |   No. of   | Proportion |\r\n|                                       |   Deaths.  |  per cent. |\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n| Deaths resulting from fire-damp       |            |            |\r\n|   explosions                          |    2019    |    20.36   |\r\n|                                       |            |            |\r\n| Deaths resulting from falling         |            |            |\r\n|   roofs and coals                     |    3953    |    39.87   |\r\n|                                       |            |            |\r\n| Deaths resulting from shaft           |            |            |\r\n|   accidents                           |    1710    |    17.24   |\r\n|                                       |            |            |\r\n| Deaths resulting from miscellaneous   |            |            |\r\n|   causes and above ground             |    2234    |    22.53   |\r\n|                                       |------------|------------|\r\n|                                       |    9916    |   100.00   |\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n\r\nEvery reader of the daily papers is familiar with the harrowing accounts\r\nwhich are there given of coal-mine explosions.\r\n\r\nThis kind of accident is one, which is, above all, associated in the\r\npublic mind with the dangers of the coal-pit. Yet the accidents arising\r\nfrom this cause number but 20 per cent. of those recorded, and granted\r\nthere be proper inspection, and the use of naked lights be absolutely\r\nabolished, this low percentage might still be considerably reduced.\r\n\r\nA terrific explosion occurred at Whitwick Colliery, Leicestershire, in\r\n1893, when two lads were killed, whilst a third was rescued after a very\r\nnarrow escape. The lads, it is stated, _were working with naked lights_,\r\nwhen a sudden fall of coal released a quantity of gas, and an immediate\r\nexplosion was the natural result. Accidents had been so rare at this pit\r\nthat it was regarded as particularly safe, and it was alleged that the\r\nuse of naked lights was not uncommon.\r\n\r\nThis is an instance of that large number of accidents which are\r\nundoubtedly preventable.\r\n\r\nAn interesting commentary on the careless manner in which miners risk\r\ntheir lives was shown in the discoveries made after an explosion at a\r\ncolliery near Wrexham in 1889. Near the scene of the explosion an\r\nunsecured safety lamp was found, and the general opinion at the time was\r\nthat the disaster was caused by the inexcusable carelessness of one of\r\nthe twenty victims. Besides this, when the clothing of the bodies\r\nrecovered was searched, the contents, taken, it should be noted, with the\r\npitmen into the mines, consisted of pipes, tobacco, matches, and even\r\nkeys for unlocking the lamps. It is a strange reflection on the manner in\r\nwhich this mine had been examined previous to the men entering upon their\r\nwork, that the under-looker, but half an hour previously, had reported\r\nthe pit to be free from gas.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of the same foolhardiness on the part of the miners is\r\ncontained in the report issued in regard to an explosion which occurred\r\nat Denny, in Stirlingshire, on April 26th, 1895. By this accident\r\nthirteen men lost their lives, and upon the bodies of eight of the number\r\nthe following articles were found; upon Patrick Carr, tin matchbox half\r\nfull of matches and a contrivance for opening lamps; John Comrie, split\r\nnail for opening lamps; Peter Conway, seven matches and split key for\r\nopening lamps; Patrick Dunton, split nail for opening lamps; John Herron,\r\nclay pipe and piece of tobacco; Henry M'Govern, tin matchbox half full of\r\nmatches; Robert Mitchell, clay pipe and piece of tobacco; John Nicol,\r\nwooden pipe, piece of tobacco, one match, and box half full of matches.\r\nThe report stated that the immediate cause of the disaster was the\r\nignition of fire-damp by naked light, the conditions of temperature being\r\nsuch as to exclude the possibility of spontaneous combustion. Henry\r\nM'Govern had previously been convicted of having a pipe in the mine. With\r\nregard to the question of sufficient ventilation it continued:--\"And we\r\nare therefore led, on a consideration of the whole evidence, to the\r\nconclusion that the accident cannot be attributed to the absence of\r\nventilation, which the mine owners were bound under the Mines Regulation\r\nAct and the special rules to provide.\" The report concluded as follows:--\r\n\"On the whole matter we have to report that, in our opinion, the\r\nexplosion at Quarter Pit on April 26th, 1895, resulting in the loss of\r\nthirteen lives, was caused by the ignition of an accumulation or an\r\noutburst of gas coming in contact with a naked light, 'other than an open\r\nsafety-lamp,' which had been unlawfully kindled by one of the miners who\r\nwere killed. In our opinion, the intensity of the explosion was\r\naggravated, and its area extended, by the ignition of coal-dust.\"\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned that accidents have frequently occurred from the\r\nfalling of \"coal-pipes,\" or, as they are also called, \"bell-moulds.\" We\r\nmust explain what is meant by this term. They are simply what appear to\r\nbe solid trunks of trees metamorphosed into coal. If we go into a\r\ntropical forest we find that the woody fibre of dead trees almost\r\ninvariably decays faster than the bark. The result is that what may\r\nappear to be a sound tree is nothing but an empty cylinder of bark. This\r\nappears to have been the case with many of the trees in coal-mines, where\r\nthey are seen to pierce the strata, and around which the miners are\r\nexcavating the coal. As the coaly mass collected around the trunk when\r\nthe coal was being formed, the interior was undergoing a process of\r\ndecomposition, while the bark assumed the form of coal. The hollow\r\ninterior then became filled with the shale or sandstone which forms the\r\nroof of the coal, and its sole support when the coal is removed from\r\naround it, is the thin rind of carbonised bark. When this falls to\r\npieces, or loses its cohesion, the sandstone trunk falls of its own\r\nweight, often causing the death of the man that works beneath it. Sir\r\nCharles Lyell mentions that in a colliery near Newcastle, no less than\r\nthirty _sigillaria_ trees were standing in their natural position in an\r\narea of fifty yards square, the interior in each case being sandstone,\r\nwhich was surrounded by a bark of friable coal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33--Part of a trunk of _Sigillaria_, showing the thin\r\nouter carbonised bark, with leaf-scars, and the seal-like impressions\r\nwhere the bark is removed.]\r\n\r\nThe last great danger to which we have here to make reference, is the\r\nexplosive action of a quantity of coal-dust in a dry condition. It is\r\nonly now commencing to be fully recognised that this is really a most\r\ndangerous explosive. As we have seen, large quantities of coal are formed\r\nalmost exclusively of _lepidodendron_ spores, and such coal is productive\r\nof a great quantity of dust. Explosions which are always more or less\r\nattributable to the effects of coal-dust are generally considered, in the\r\nofficial statistics, to have been caused by fire-damp. The Act regulating\r\nmines in Great Britain is scarcely up to date in this respect. There is a\r\nregulation which provides for the watering of all dry and dusty places\r\nwithin twenty yards from the spot where a shot is fired, but the\r\nenforcement of this regulation in each and every pit necessarily devolves\r\non the managers, many of whom in the absence of an inspector leave the\r\nrequirement a dead letter. Every improvement which results in the better\r\nventilation of a coal-mine tends to leave the dust in a more dangerous\r\ncondition. The air, as it descends the shaft and permeates the workings,\r\nbecomes more and more heated, and licks up every particle of moisture it\r\ncan touch. Thorough ventilation results in more greatly freeing a mine of\r\nthe dangerous fire-damp, but the remedy brings about another disease,\r\nviz., the drying-up of all moisture. The dust is thus left in a\r\ndangerously inflammable condition, acting like a train of gunpowder, to\r\nbe started, it may be, by the slightest breath of an explosion. There is\r\napparently little doubt that the presence of coal-dust in a dry state in\r\na mine appreciably increases the liability of explosion in that mine.\r\n\r\nSo far as Great Britain is concerned, a Royal Commission was appointed by\r\nLord Rosebery's Government to inquire into and investigate the facts\r\nreferring to coal-dust. Generally speaking, the conclusion arrived at was\r\nthat fine coal-dust was inflammable under certain conditions. There was\r\nconsiderable difference of opinion as to what these conditions were. Some\r\nwere of opinion that coal-dust and air alone were of an explosive nature,\r\nwhilst others thought that alone they were not, but that the addition of\r\na small quantity of fire-damp rendered the mixture explosive. An\r\nimportant conclusion was come to, that, with the combustion of coal-dust\r\nalone, there was little or no concussion, and that the flame was not of\r\nan explosive character.\r\n\r\nCoal-dust was, however, admittedly dangerous, especially if in a dry\r\ncondition. The effects of an explosion of gas might be considerably\r\nextended by its presence, and there seems every reason to believe that,\r\nwith a suitable admixture of air and a very small proportion of gas, it\r\nforms a dangerous explosive. Legislation in the direction of the report\r\nof the Commission is urgently needed.\r\n\r\nWe have seen elsewhere what it is in the dust which makes it dangerous,\r\nhow that, for the most part, it consists of the dust-like spores of the\r\n_lepidodendron_ tree, fine and impalpable as the spores on the backs of\r\nsome of our living ferns, and the fact that this consists of a large\r\nproportion of resin makes it the easily inflammable substance it is.\r\nNothing but an incessant watering of the workings in such cases will\r\nrender the dust innocuous. The dust is extremely fine, and is easily\r\ncarried into every nook and crevice, and when, as at Bridgend in 1892, it\r\nexplodes, it is driven up and out of the shaft, enveloping everything\r\ntemporarily in dust and darkness.\r\n\r\nIn some of the pits in South Wales a system of fine sprays of water is in\r\nuse, by which the water is ejected from pin-holes pricked in a series of\r\npipes which are carried through the workings. A fine mist is thus caused\r\nwhere necessary, which is carried forward by the force of the ventilating\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nA thorough system of inspection in coal-mines throughout the world is\r\nundoubtedly urgently called for, in order to ensure the proper carrying\r\nout of the various regulations framed for their safety. It is extremely\r\nunfortunate that so many of the accidents which happen are preventable,\r\nif only men of knowledge and of scientific attainments filled the\r\nresponsible positions of the overlookers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nEARLY HISTORY--ITS USE AND ITS ABUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extensive use of coal throughout the civilised world for purposes of\r\nheating and illumination, and for the carrying on of manufactures and\r\nindustries, may be regarded as a well-marked characteristic of the age in\r\nwhich we live.\r\n\r\nCoal must have been in centuries past a familiar object to many\r\ngenerations. People must have long been living in close proximity to its\r\noutcrops at the sides of the mountains and at the surface of the land,\r\nyet without being acquainted with its practical value, and it seems\r\nstrange that so little use was made of it until about three centuries\r\nago, and that its use did not spread earlier and more quickly throughout\r\ncivilised countries.\r\n\r\nA mineral fuel is mentioned by Theophrastus about 300 B.C., from which it\r\nis inferred that thus early it was dug from some of the more shallow\r\ndepths. The Britons before the time of the Roman invasion are credited\r\nwith some slight knowledge of its industrial value. Prehistoric\r\nexcavations have been found in Monmouthshire, and at Stanley, in\r\nDerbyshire, and the flint axes there actually found imbedded in the layer\r\nof coal are reasonably held to indicate its excavation by neolithic or\r\npalaeolithic (stone-age) workmen.\r\n\r\nThe fact that coal cinders have been found on old Roman walls in\r\nconjunction with Roman tools and implements, goes to prove that its use,\r\nat least for heating purposes, was known in England prior to the Saxon\r\ninvasion, whilst some polygonal chambers in the six-foot seam near the\r\nriver Douglas, in Lancashire, are supposed also to be Roman.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese were early acquainted with the existence of coal, and knew of\r\nits industrial value to the extent of using it for the baking of\r\nporcelain.\r\n\r\nThe fact of its extensive existence in Great Britain, and the valuable\r\nuses to which it might be put, did not, however, meet with much notice\r\nuntil the ninth century, when, owing to the decrease of the\r\nforest-area, and consequently of the supply of wood-charcoal therefrom,\r\nit began to attract attention as affording an excellent substitute for\r\ncharcoal.\r\n\r\nThe coal-miner was, however, still a creation of the future, and even as\r\npeat is collected in Ireland at the present day for fuel, without the\r\nlaborious process of mining for it, so those people living in\r\ncoal-bearing districts found their needs satisfied by the quantity of\r\ncoal, small as it was, which appeared ready to hand on the sides of the\r\ncarboniferous mountains. Till then, and for a long time afterwards, the\r\nprincipal source of fuel consisted of vast forests, amidst which the\r\ncharcoal-burners, or \"colliers\" as they were even then called, lived out\r\ntheir lonely existence in preparing charcoal and hewing wood, for the\r\nfires of the baronial halls and stately castles then swarming throughout\r\nthe land. As the forests became used up, recourse was had more and more\r\nto coal, and in 1239 the first charter dealing with and recognising the\r\nimportance of the supplies was granted to the freemen of Newcastle,\r\naccording them permission to dig for coals in the Castle fields. About\r\nthe same time a coal-pit at Preston, Haddingtonshire, was granted to the\r\nmonks of Newbattle.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of Newcastle coal were sent to London, but the city was loth to\r\nadopt its use, objecting to the innovation as one prejudicial to the\r\nhealth of its citizens. By the end of the 16th century, two ships only\r\nwere found sufficient to satisfy the demand for stone-coal in London.\r\nThis slow progress may, perhaps, have been partially owing to the\r\ndifficulties which were placed in the way of its universal use. Great\r\nopposition was experienced by those who imported it into the metropolis,\r\nand the increasing amount which was used by brewers and others about the\r\nyear 1300, caused serious complaints to be made, the effect of which was\r\nto induce Parliament to obtain a proclamation from the King prohibiting\r\nits use, and empowering the justices to inflict a fine on those who\r\npersisted in burning it. The nuisance which coal has since proved itself,\r\nin the pollution of the atmosphere and in the denuding of wide tracts of\r\ncountry of all vegetation, was even thus early recognised, and had the\r\nefforts which were then made to stamp out its use, proved successful,\r\nthose who live now in the great cities might never have become acquainted\r\nwith that species of black winter fog which at times hangs like a pall\r\nover them, and transforms the brightness of day into a darkness little\r\nremoved from that of night. At the same time, we must bear in mind that\r\nit is universally acknowledged that England owes her prosperity, and her\r\npre-eminence in commerce, in great part, to her happy possession of wide\r\nand valuable coal-fields, and many authorities have not hesitated to say,\r\nthat, in their opinion, the length of time during which England will\r\ncontinue to hold her prominent position as an industrial nation is\r\nlimited by the time during which her coal will last.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to prohibit the burning of coal was not, however, very\r\nsuccessful, for in the reign of Edward III. a license was again granted\r\nto the freemen of Newcastle to dig for coals. Newcastle was thus the\r\nfirst town to become famous as the home of the coal-miner, and the fame\r\nwhich it early acquired, it has held unceasingly ever since.\r\n\r\nOther attempts at prohibition of the article were made at various times\r\nsubsequently, amongst them being one which was made in Elizabeth's reign.\r\nIt was supposed that the health of the country squires, who came to town\r\nto attend the session of Parliament, suffered considerably during their\r\nsojourn in London, and, to remedy this serious state of affairs, the use\r\nof stone-coal during the time Parliament was sitting was once more\r\nprohibited.\r\n\r\nCoal was, however, by this time beginning to be recognised as a most\r\nvaluable and useful article of fuel, and had taken a position in the\r\nindustrial life of the country from which it was difficult to remove it.\r\nRather than attempt to have arrested the growing use of coal, Parliament\r\nwould have been better employed had it framed laws compelling the\r\nmanufacturers and other large burners to consume their own smoke, and\r\ninstead of aiming at total prohibition, have encouraged an intelligent\r\nand more economical use of it.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all prohibition its use rapidly spread, and it was soon\r\napplied to the smelting of iron and to other purposes. Iron had been\r\nlargely produced in the south of England from strata of the Wealden\r\nformation, during the existence of the great forest which at one time\r\nextended for miles throughout Surrey and Sussex. The discovery of coal,\r\nhowever, and the opening up of many mines in the north, gave an important\r\nimpetus to the smelting of iron in those counties, and as the forests of\r\nthe Weald became exhausted, the iron trade gradually declined. Furnace\r\nafter furnace became extinguished, until in 1809 that at Ashburnham,\r\nwhich had lingered on for some years, was compelled to bow to the\r\ninevitable fate which had overtaken the rest of the iron blast-furnaces.\r\n\r\nIn referring to this subject, Sir James Picton says:--\"Ironstone of\r\nexcellent quality is found in various parts of the county, and was very\r\nearly made use of. Even before the advent of the Romans, the Forest of\r\nDean in the west, and the Forest of Anderida, in Sussex, in the east,\r\nwere the two principal sources from which the metal was derived, and all\r\nthrough the mediaeval ages the manufacture was continued. After the\r\ndiscovery of the art of smelting and casting iron in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the manufacture in Sussex received a great impulse from the\r\nabundance of wood for fuel, and from that time down to the middle of the\r\nlast century it continued to flourish. One of the largest furnaces was at\r\nLamberhurst, on the borders of Kent, where the noble balustrade\r\nsurrounding St Paul's Cathedral was cast at a cost of about £11,000. It\r\nis stated by the historian Holinshed that the first cast-iron ordnance\r\nwas manufactured at Buxted. Two specialities in the iron trade belonged\r\nto Sussex, the manufacture of chimney-backs, and cast-iron plates for\r\ngrave-stones. At the time when wood constituted the fuel the backs of\r\nfire-places were frequently ornamented with neat designs. Specimens, both\r\nof the chimney-backs and of the monuments, are occasionally met with.\r\nThese articles were exported from Rye. The iron manufacture, of course,\r\nmet with considerable discouragement on the discovery of smelting with\r\npit-coal, and the rapid progress of iron works in Staffordshire and the\r\nNorth, but it lingered on until the great forest was cut down and the\r\nfuel exhausted.\"\r\n\r\nIn his interesting work, \"Sylvia,\" published in 1661, Evelyn, in speaking\r\nof the noxious vapours poured out into the air by the increasing number\r\nof coal fires, writes, \"This is that pernicious smoke which sullies all\r\nher glory, superinducing a sooty crust or furr upon all that it lights,\r\nspoiling movables, tarnishing the plate, gildings and furniture, and\r\ncorroding the very iron bars and hardest stones with those piercing and\r\nacrimonious spirits which accompany its sulphur, and executing more in\r\none year than the pure air of the country could effect in some hundreds.\"\r\nThe evils here mentioned are those which have grown and have become\r\nintensified a hundred-fold during the two centuries and a half which have\r\nsince elapsed. When the many efforts which were made to limit its use in\r\nthe years prior to 1600 are remembered; at which time, we are informed,\r\ntwo ships only were engaged in bringing coal to London, it at once\r\nappears how paltry are the efforts made now to moderate these same\r\nbaneful influences on our atmosphere, at a time when the annual\r\nconsumption of coal in the United Kingdom has reached the enormous total\r\nof 190 millions of tons. The various smoke-abatement associations which\r\nhave started into existence during the last few years are doing a little,\r\nalthough very little, towards directing popular attention to the subject;\r\nbut there is an enormous task before them, that of awakening every\r\nindividual to an appreciation of the personal interest which he has in\r\ntheir success, and to realise how much might at once be done if each were\r\nto do his share, minute though it might be, towards mitigating the evils\r\nof the present mode of coal-consumption. Probably very few householders\r\never realise what important factories their chimneys constitute, in\r\nbringing about air pollution, and the more they do away with the use of\r\nbituminous coal for fuel, the nearer we shall be to the time when yellow\r\nfog will be a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of smoke consists of particles of pure unconsumed\r\ncarbon, and this is accompanied in its passage up our chimneys by\r\nsulphurous acid, begotten by the sulphur which is contained in the coal\r\nto the amount of about eight pounds in every thousand; by sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen, by hydro-carbons, and by vapours of various kinds of oils,\r\nsmall quantities of ammonia, and other bodies not by any means\r\ncontributing to a healthy condition of the atmosphere. A good deal of the\r\nheavier carbon is deposited along the walls of chimneys in the form of\r\nsoot, together with a small percentage of sulphate of ammonia; this is as\r\na consequence very generally used for manure. The remainder is poured out\r\ninto the atmosphere, there to undergo fresh changes, and to become a\r\nfruitful cause of those thick black fogs with which town-dwellers are so\r\nfamiliar. Sulphuretted hydrogen (H_{2}S) is a gas well known to students\r\nof chemistry as a most powerful reagent, its most characteristic external\r\nproperty being the extremely offensive odour which it possesses, and\r\nwhich bears a strong resemblance to that of rotten eggs or decomposing\r\nfish. It tarnishes silver work and picture frames very rapidly. On\r\ncombustion it changes to sulphurous acid (SO_{2}), and this in turn has\r\nthe power of taking up from the air another atom of oxygen, forming\r\nsulphuric acid (SO_{3} + water), or, as we more familiarly know it, oil\r\nof vitriol.\r\n\r\nYet the smoke itself, including as it does all the many impurities which\r\nexist in coal, is not only evil in itself, but is evil in its influences.\r\nDr Siemens has said:--\"It has been shown that the fine dust resulting\r\nfrom the imperfect combustion of coal was mainly instrumental in the\r\nformation of fog; each particle of solid matter attracting to itself\r\naqueous vapour. These globules of fog were rendered particularly\r\ntenacious and disagreeable by the presence of tar vapour, another result\r\nof imperfect combustion of raw fuel, which might be turned to better\r\naccount at the dyeworks. The hurtful influence of smoke upon public\r\nhealth, the great personal discomfort to which it gave rise, and the vast\r\nexpense it indirectly caused through the destruction of our monuments,\r\npictures, furniture, and apparel, were now being recognised.\"\r\n\r\nThe most effectual remedy would result from a general recognition of the\r\nfact that wherever smoke was produced, fuel was being consumed\r\nwastefully, and that all our calorific effects, from the largest furnace\r\nto the domestic fire, could be realised as completely, and more\r\neconomically, without allowing any of the fuel employed to reach the\r\natmosphere unburnt. This most desirable result might be effected by the\r\nuse of gas for all heating purposes, with or without the additional use\r\nof coke or anthracite. The success of the so-called smoke-consuming\r\nstoves is greatly open to question, whilst some of them have been\r\nreported upon by those appointed to inspect them as actually accentuating\r\nthe incomplete combustion, the abolition of which they were invented to\r\nbring about.\r\n\r\nThe smoke nuisance is one which cuts at the very basis of our business\r\nlife. The cloud which, under certain atmospheric conditions, rests like a\r\npall over our great cities, will not even permit at times of a single ray\r\nof sunshine permeating it. No one knows whence it rises, nor at what hour\r\nto expect it. It is like a giant spectre which, having lain dormant since\r\nthe carboniferous age, has been raised into life and being at the call of\r\nrestless humanity; it is now punishing us for our prodigal use of the\r\nwealth it left us, by clasping us in its deadly arms, cutting off our\r\nbrilliant sunshine, and necessitating the use in the daytime of\r\nartificial light; inducing all kinds of bronchial and throat affections,\r\ncorroding telegraph and telephone wires, and weathering away the masonry\r\nof public buildings.\r\n\r\nThe immense value to us of the coal-deposits which lie buried in such\r\nprofusion in the earth beneath us, can only be appreciated when we\r\nconsider the many uses to which coal has been put. We must remember, as\r\nwe watch the ever-extending railway ramifying the country in every\r\ndirection, that the first railway and the first locomotive ever built,\r\nwere those which were brought into being in 1814 by George Stephenson,\r\nfor the purpose of the carriage of coals from the Killingworth Colliery.\r\nTo the importance of coal in our manufactures, therefore, we owe the\r\nsubsequent development of steam locomotive power as the means of the\r\nintroduction of passenger traffic, and by the use of coal we are enabled\r\nto travel from one end of the country to the other in a space of time\r\ninconceivably small as compared with that occupied on the same journey in\r\nthe old coaching days. The increased rapidity with which our vessels\r\ncross the wide ocean we owe to the use of coal; our mines are carried to\r\ngreater depths owing to the power our pumping-engines obtain from coal in\r\nclearing the mines of water and in ensuring ventilation; the enormous\r\ndevelopment of the iron trade only became possible with the increased\r\nblast power obtained from the consumption of coal, and the very hulls and\r\nengines of our steamships are made of this iron; our railroads and\r\nengines are mostly of iron, and when we think of the extensive use of\r\niron utensils in every walk in life, we see how important becomes the\r\npower we possess of obtaining the necessary fuel to feed the smelting\r\nfurnaces. Evaporation by the sun was at one time the sole means of\r\nobtaining salt from seawater; now coal is used to boil the salt pans and\r\nto purify the brine from the salt-mines in the triassic strata of\r\nCheshire. The extent to which gas is used for illuminating purposes\r\nreminds us of another important product obtained from coal. Paraffin oil\r\nand petroleum we obtain from coal, whilst candles, oils, dyes,\r\nlubricants, and many other useful articles go to attest the importance of\r\nthe underground stores of that mineral which has well and deservedly been\r\ntermed the \"black diamond.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nHOW GAS IS MADE--ILLUMINATING OILS AND BYE-PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccustomed as we are at the present day to see street after street of\r\nwell-lighted thoroughfares, brilliantly illuminated by gas-lamps\r\nmaintained by public authority, we can scarcely appreciate the fact that\r\nthe use of gas is, comparatively speaking, of but recent growth, and\r\nthat, like the use of coal itself, it has not yet existed a century in\r\npublic favour. Valuable as coal is in very many different ways, perhaps\r\nnext in value to its actual use as fuel, ranks the use of the immediate\r\nproduct of its distillation--viz., gas; and although gas is in some\r\nrespects waning before the march of the electric light in our day, yet,\r\neven as gas at no time has altogether superseded old-fashioned oil, so we\r\nneed not anticipate a time when gas in turn will be likely to be\r\nsuperseded by the electric light, there being many uses to which the one\r\nmay be put, to which the latter would be altogether inapplicable; for, in\r\nthe words of Dr Siemens, assuming the cost of electric light to be\r\npractically the same as gas, the preference for one or other would in\r\neach application be decided upon grounds of relative convenience, but\r\ngas-lighting would hold its own as the poor man's friend. Gas is an\r\ninstitution of the utmost value to the artisan; it requires hardly any\r\nattention, is supplied upon regulated terms, and gives, with what should\r\nbe a cheerful light, a genial warmth, which often saves the lighting of a\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThe revolution which gas has made in the appearance of the streets, where\r\nformerly the only illumination was that provided by each householder,\r\nwho, according to his means, hung out a more or less efficient lantern,\r\nand consequently a more or less smoky one, cannot fail also to have\r\nbrought about a revolution in the social aspects of the streets, and\r\ntherefore is worthy to be ranked as a social reforming agent; and some\r\nslight knowledge of the process of its manufacture, such as it is here\r\nproposed to give, should be in the possession of every educated\r\nindividual. Yet the subjects which must be dealt with in this chapter are\r\nso numerous and of such general interest, that we shall be unable to\r\nenter more than superficially into any one part of the whole, but shall\r\nstrive to give a clear and comprehensive view, which shall satisfy the\r\ninquirer who is not a specialist.\r\n\r\nThe credit of the first attempt at utilising the gaseous product of coal\r\nfor illumination appears to be due to Murdock, an engineer at Redruth,\r\nwho, in 1792, introduced it into his house and offices, and who, ten\r\nyears afterwards, as the result of numerous experiments which he made\r\nwith a view to its utilisation, made a public display at Birmingham on\r\nthe occasion of the Peace of Amiens, in 1802.\r\n\r\nMore than a century before, however, the gas obtained from coal had been\r\nexperimented upon by a Dr Clayton, who, about 1690, conceived the idea of\r\nheating coal until its gaseous constituents were forced out of it. He\r\ndescribed how he obtained steam first of all, then a black oil, and\r\nfinally a \"spirit,\" as our ancestors were wont to term the gas. This, to\r\nhis surprise, ignited on a light being applied to it, and he considerably\r\namused his friends with the wonders of this inflammatory spirit. For a\r\ncentury afterwards it remained in its early condition, a chemical wonder,\r\na thing to be amused with; but it required the true genius and energy of\r\nMurdock to show the great things of which it was capable.\r\n\r\nLondon received its first instalment of gas in 1807, and during the next\r\nfew years its use became more and more extended, houses and streets\r\nrapidly receiving supplies in quick succession. It was not, however, till\r\nabout the year 1820 that its use throughout the country became at all\r\ngeneral, St James' Park being gas-lit in the succeeding year. This is not\r\nyet eighty years ago, and amongst the many wonderful things which have\r\nsprung up during the present century, perhaps we may place in the\r\nforemost rank for actual utility, the gas extracted from coal, conveyed\r\nas it is through miles upon miles of underground pipes into the very\r\nhomes of the people, and constituting now almost as much a necessity of a\r\ncomfortable existence as water itself.\r\n\r\nThe use of gas thus rapidly extended for illuminating purposes, and to a\r\nvery great extent superseded the old-fashioned means of illumination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Inside a Gas-Holder.]\r\n\r\nThe gas companies which sprang up were not slow to notice that, seeing\r\nthe gas was supplied by meter, it was to their pecuniary advantage \"to\r\ngive merely the prescribed illuminating power, and to discourage the\r\ninvention of economical burners, in order that the consumption might\r\nreach a maximum. The application of gas for heating purposes had not been\r\nencouraged, and was still made difficult in consequence of the\r\nobjectionable practice of reducing the pressure in the mains during\r\ndaytime to the lowest possible point consistent with prevention of\r\natmospheric indraught.\"\r\n\r\nThe introduction of an important rival into the field in the shape of the\r\nelectric light has now given a powerful impetus to the invention and\r\nintroduction of effective gas-lamps, and amongst inventors of recent\r\nyears no name is, perhaps, in this respect so well known as the name of\r\nSugg. As long as gas retained almost the monopoly, there was no incentive\r\nto the gas companies to produce an effective light cheaply; but now that\r\nthe question of the relative cheapness of gas and electricity is being\r\nactively discussed, the gas companies, true to the instinct of\r\nself-preservation, seem determined to show what can be done when gas is\r\nconsumed in a scientific manner.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how best a burner should be constructed in order\r\nthat the gas that is burnt should give the greatest possible amount of\r\nillumination, let us consider for a moment the composition of the gas\r\nflame. It consists of three parts, (1) an interior dark space, in which\r\nthe elements of the gas are in an unconsumed state; (2) an inner ring\r\naround the former, whence the greatest amount of light is obtained, and\r\nin which are numerous particles of carbon at a white heat, each awaiting\r\na supply of oxygen in order to bring about combustion; and (3) an outer\r\nring of blue flame in which complete combustion has taken place, and from\r\nwhich the largest amount of heat is evolved.\r\n\r\nThe second of these portions of the flame corresponds with the \"reducing\"\r\nflame of the blow-pipe, since this part, if turned upon an oxide, will\r\nreduce it, i.e., abstract its oxygen from it. This part also corresponds\r\nwith the jet of the Bunsen burner, when the holes are closed by which\r\notherwise air would mingle with the gas, or with the flame from a\r\ngas-stove when the gas ignites beneath the proper igniting-jets, and\r\nwhich gives consequently a white or yellow flame.\r\n\r\nThe third portion, on the other hand, corresponds with the \"oxidising\"\r\nflame of the blow-pipe, since it gives up oxygen to bodies that are\r\nthirsting for it. This also corresponds with the ordinary blue flame of\r\nthe Bunsen burner, and with the blue flame of gas-stoves where heat, and\r\nnot light, is required, the blue flame in both cases being caused by the\r\nadmixture of air with the gas.\r\n\r\nThus, in order that gas may give the best illumination, we must increase\r\nthe yellow or white space of carbon particles at a white heat, and a\r\nburner that will do this, and at the same time hold the balance so that\r\nunconsumed particles of carbon shall not escape in the way of smoke, will\r\ngive the most successful illuminating results. With this end in view the\r\naddition of albo-carbon to a bulb in the gas-pipe has proved very\r\nsuccessful, and the incandescent gas-jet is constructed on exactly the\r\nsame chemical principle. The invention of burners which brought about\r\nthis desirable end has doubtless not been without effect in acting as a\r\npowerful obstacle to the widespread introduction of the electric light.\r\n\r\nWithout entering into details of the manufacture of gas, it will be as\r\nwell just to glance at the principal parts of the apparatus used.\r\n\r\nThe gasometer, as it has erroneously been called, is a familiar object to\r\nmost people, not only to sight but unfortunately also to the organs of\r\nsmell. It is in reality of course only the gas-holder, in which the final\r\nproduct of distillation of the coal is stored, and from which the gas\r\nimmediately passes into the distributing mains.\r\n\r\nThe first, and perhaps, most important portion of the apparatus used in\r\ngas-making is the series of _retorts_ into which the coal is placed, and\r\nfrom which, by the application of heat, the various volatile products\r\ndistil over. These retorts are huge cast-iron vessels, encased in strong\r\nbrick-work, usually five in a group, and beneath which a large furnace is\r\nkept going until the process is complete. Each retort has an iron exit\r\npipe affixed to it, through which the gases generated by the furnace are\r\ncarried off. The exit pipes all empty themselves into what is known as\r\nthe _hydraulic main_, a long horizontal cylinder, and in this the gas\r\nbegins to deposit a portion of its impurities. The immediate products of\r\ndistillation are, after steam and air, gas, tar, ammoniacal liquor,\r\nsulphur in various forms, and coke, the last being left behind in the\r\nretort. In the hydraulic main some of the tar and ammoniacal liquor\r\nalready begin to be deposited. The gas passes on to the _condenser_,\r\nwhich consists of a number of U-shaped pipes. Here the impurities are\r\nstill further condensed out, and are collected in the _tar-pit_ whilst\r\nthe gas proceeds, still further lightened of its impurities. It may be\r\nmentioned that the temperature of the gas in the condenser is reduced to\r\nabout 60° F., but below this some of the most valuable of the illuminants\r\nof coal-gas would commence to be deposited in liquid form, and care has\r\nto be taken to prevent a greater lowering of temperature. A mechanical\r\ncontrivance known as the _exhauster_ is next used, by which the gas is,\r\namongst other things, helped forward in its onward movement through the\r\napparatus. The gas then passes to the _washers_ or _scrubbers_, a series\r\nof tall towers, from which water is allowed to fall as a fine spray, and\r\nby means of which large quantities of ammonia, sulphuretted hydrogen,\r\ncarbonic acid and oxide, and cyanogen compounds, are removed. In the\r\nscrubber the water used in keeping the coke, with which it is filled,\r\ndamp, absorbs these compounds, and the union of the ammonia with certain\r\nof them takes place, resulting in the formation of carbonate of ammonia\r\n(smelling salts), sulphide and sulphocyanide of ammonia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Filling Retorts by Machinery.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--CONDENSERS.]\r\n\r\nHitherto the purification of the gas has been brought about by mechanical\r\nmeans, but the gas now enters the \"_purifier_,\" in which it undergoes a\r\nfurther cleansing, but this time by chemical means.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.]\r\n\r\nThe agent used is either lime or hydrated oxide of iron, and by their\r\nmeans the gas is robbed of its carbonic acid and the greater part of its\r\nsulphur compounds. The process is then considered complete, and the gas\r\npasses on into the water chamber over which the gas-holder is reared, and\r\nin which it rises through the water, forcing the huge cylinder upward\r\naccording to the pressure it exerts.\r\n\r\nThe gas-holder is poised between a number of upright pillars by a series\r\nof chains and pulleys, which allow of its easy ascent or descent\r\naccording as the supply is greater or less than that drawn from it by the\r\ngas mains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.]\r\n\r\nWhen we see the process which is necessary in order to obtain pure gas,\r\nwe begin to appreciate to what an extent the atmosphere is fouled when\r\nmany of the products of distillation, which, as far as the production of\r\ngas is concerned, may be called impurities, are allowed to escape free\r\nwithout let or hindrance. In these days of strict sanitary inspection it\r\nseems strange that the air in the neighbourhood of gas-works is still\r\nallowed to become contaminated by the escape of impure compounds from the\r\nvarious portions of the gas-making apparatus. Go where one may, the\r\npresence of these compounds is at once apparent to the nostrils within a\r\nnone too limited area around them, and yet their deleterious effects can\r\nbe almost reduced to a minimum by the use of proper purifying agents, and\r\nby a scientific oversight of the whole apparatus. It certainly behoves\r\nall sanitary authorities to look well after any gas-works situated within\r\ntheir districts.\r\n\r\nNow let us see what these first five products of distillation actually\r\nare.\r\n\r\nFirstly, house-gas. Everybody knows what house-gas is. It cannot,\r\nhowever, be stated to be any one gas in particular, since it is a\r\nmechanical mixture of at least three different gases, and often contains\r\nsmall quantities of others.\r\n\r\nA very large proportion consists of what is known as marsh-gas, or light\r\ncarburetted hydrogen. This occurs occluded or locked up in the pores of\r\nthe coal, and often oozes out into the galleries of coal-mines, where it\r\nis known as firedamp (German _dampf_, vapour). It is disengaged wherever\r\nvegetable matter has fallen and has become decayed. If it were thence\r\ncollected, together with an admixture of ten times its volume of air, a\r\nminiature coal-mine explosion could be produced by the introduction of a\r\nmatch into the mixture. Alone, however, it burns with a feebly luminous\r\nflame, although to its presence our house-gas owes a great portion of its\r\nheating power. Marsh-gas is the first of the series of hydro-carbons\r\nknown chemically as the _paraffins_, and is an extremely light substance,\r\nbeing little more than half the weight of an equal bulk of air. It is\r\ncomposed of four atoms of hydrogen to one of carbon (CH_{4}).\r\n\r\nMarsh-gas, together with hydrogen and the monoxide of carbon, the last of\r\nwhich burns with the dull blue flame often seen at the surface of fires,\r\nparticularly coke and charcoal fires, form about 87 per cent. of the\r\nwhole volume of house-gas, and are none of them anything but poor\r\nilluminants.\r\n\r\nThe illuminating power of house-gas depends on the presence therein of\r\nolefiant gas (_ethylene_), or, as it is sometimes termed, heavy\r\ncarburetted hydrogen. This is the first of the series of hydro-carbons\r\nknown as the _olefines_, and is composed of two atoms of carbon to every\r\nfour atoms of hydrogen (C_{2}H_{4}). Others of the olefines are present\r\nin minute quantities. These assist in increasing the illuminosity, which\r\nis sometimes greatly enhanced, too, by the presence of a small quantity\r\nof benzene vapour. These illuminants, however, constitute but about 6 per\r\ncent. of the whole.\r\n\r\nAdded to these, there are four other usual constituents which in no way\r\nincrease the value of gas, but which rather detract from it. They are\r\nconsequently as far as possible removed as impurities in the process of\r\ngas-making. These are nitrogen, carbonic acid gas, and the destructive\r\nsulphur compounds, sulphuretted hydrogen and carbon bisulphide vapour. It\r\nis to the last two to which are to be attributed the injurious effects\r\nwhich the burning of gas has upon pictures, books, and also the\r\ntarnishing which metal fittings suffer where gas is burnt, since they\r\ngive rise to the formation of oil of vitriol (sulphuric acid), which is\r\nbeing incessantly poured into the air. Of course the amount so given off\r\nis little as compared with that which escapes from a coal fire, but,\r\nfortunately for the inmates of the room, in this case the greater\r\nquantity goes up the chimney; this, however, is but a method of\r\npostponing the evil day, until the atmosphere becomes so laden with\r\nimpurities that what proceeds at first up the chimney will finally again\r\nmake its way back through the doors and windows. A recent official report\r\ntells us that, in the town, of St Helen's alone, sufficient sulphur\r\nescapes annually into the atmosphere to finally produce 110,580 tons of\r\nsulphuric acid, and a computation has been made that every square mile of\r\nland in London is deluged annually with 180 tons of the same\r\nvegetation-denuding acid. It is a matter for wonder that any green thing\r\ncontinues to exist in such places at all.\r\n\r\nThe chief constituents of coal-gas are, therefore, briefly as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n/ (1)  Hydrogen,\r\n| (2)  Marsh-gas (carburetted hydrogen or fire-damp),\r\n| (3)  Carbon monoxide,\r\n| (4)  Olefiant gas (ethylene, or heavy carburetted hydrogen), with\r\n\\      other olefines,\r\n/ (5)  Nitrogen,\r\n| (6)  Carbonic acid gas,\r\n| (7)  Sulphuretted hydrogen,\r\n\\ (8) Carbon bisulphide (vapour),\r\n\r\nthe last four being regarded as impurities, which are removed as far as\r\npossible in the manufacture.\r\n\r\nIn the process of distillation of the coal, we have seen that various\r\nother important substances are brought into existence. The final residue\r\nof coke, which is impregnated with the sulphur which has not been\r\nvolatilised in the form of sulphurous gases, we need scarcely more than\r\nmention here. But the gas-tar and the ammoniacal liquor are two important\r\nproducts which demand something more than our casual attention. At one\r\ntime regarded by gas engineers as unfortunately necessary nuisances in\r\nthe manufacture of gas, they have both become so valuable on account of\r\nmaterials which can be obtained from them, that they enable gas itself to\r\nbe sold now at less than half its original price. The waste of former\r\ngenerations is being utilised in this, and an instance is recorded in\r\nwhich tar, which was known to have been lying useless at the bottom of a\r\ncanal for years, has been purchased by a gas engineer for distilling\r\npurposes. It has been estimated that about 590,000 tons of coal-tar are\r\ndistilled annually.\r\n\r\nTar in its primitive condition has been used, as every one is aware, for\r\npainting or tarring a variety of objects, such as barges and palings, in\r\nfact, as a kind of protection to the object covered from the ravages of\r\ninsects or worms, or to prevent corrosion when applied to metal piers.\r\nBut it is worthy of a better purpose, and is capable of yielding far more\r\nuseful and interesting substances than even the most imaginative\r\nindividual could have dreamed of fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the process of distillation, the tar, after standing in tanks for some\r\ntime, in order that any ammoniacal liquor which may be present may rise\r\nto the surface and be drawn off, is pumped into large stills, where a\r\nmoderate amount of heat is applied to it. The result is that some of the\r\nmore volatile products pass over and are collected in a receiver. These\r\nfirst products are known as _first light oils_, or _crude coal-naphtha_,\r\nand to this naphtha all the numerous natural naphthas which have been\r\ndiscovered in various portions of the world, and to which have been\r\napplied numerous local names, bear a very close resemblance. Such an one,\r\nfor instance, was that small but famous spring at Biddings, in\r\nDerbyshire, from which the late Mr Young--Paraffin Young--obtained his\r\nwell-known paraffin oil, which gave the initial impetus to what has since\r\ndeveloped into a trade of immense proportions in every quarter of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the crude coal-naphtha ceases to flow over, and the heat is\r\nincreased. The result is that a fresh series of products, known as\r\n_medium oils_, passes over, and these oils are again collected and kept\r\nseparate from the previous series. These in turn cease to flow, when, by\r\na further increase of heat, what are known as the _heavy oils_ finally\r\npass over, and when the last of these, _green grease_, as it is called,\r\ndistils over, pitch alone is left in the still. Pitch is used to a large\r\nextent in the preparation of artificial asphalte, and also of a fuel\r\nknown as \"briquettes.\"\r\n\r\nThe products thus obtained at the various stages of the process are\r\nthemselves subjected to further distillation, and by the exercise of\r\ngreat care, requiring the most delicate and accurate treatment, a large\r\nvariety of oils is obtained, and these are retailed under many and\r\nvarious fanciful names.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important and best known products of the fractional\r\ndistillation of crude coal-naphtha is that known as _benzene_, or\r\nbenzole, (C_{6}H_{6}). This, in its unrefined condition, is a light\r\nspirit which distils over at a point somewhat below the boiling point of\r\nwater, but a delicate process of rectification is necessary to produce\r\nthe pure spirit. Other products of the same light oils are toluene and\r\nxylene.\r\n\r\nBenzene of a certain quality is of course a very familiar and useful\r\nhousehold supplement. It is sometimes known and sold as _benzene collas_,\r\nand is used for removing grease from clothing, cleaning kid gloves, &c.\r\nIf pure it is in reality a most dangerous spirit, being very inflammable;\r\nit is also extremely volatile, so much so that, if an uncorked bottle be\r\nleft in a warm room where there is a fire or other light near, its vapour\r\nwill probably ignite. Should the vapour become mixed with air before\r\nignition, it becomes a most dangerous explosive, and it will thus be seen\r\nhow necessary it is to handle the article in household use in a most\r\ncautious manner. Being highly volatile, a considerable degree of cold is\r\nexperienced if a drop be placed on the hand and allowed to evaporate.\r\n\r\nBenzene, which is only a compound of carbon and hydrogen, was first\r\ndiscovered by Faraday in 1825; it is now obtained in large quantities\r\nfrom coal-tar, not so much for use as benzene; is for its conversion, in\r\nthe first place, by the action of nitric acid, into _nitro-benzole,_ a\r\nliquid having an odour like the oil of bitter almonds, and which is much\r\nused by perfumers under the name of _essence de mirbane_; and, in the\r\nsecond place, for the production from this nitro-benzole of the far-famed\r\n_aniline_. After the distillation of benzene from the crude coal-naphtha\r\nis completed, the chief impurities in the residue are charred and\r\ndeposited by the action of strong sulphuric acid. By further distillation\r\na lighter oil is given off, often known as _artificial turpentine oil_,\r\nwhich is used as a solvent for varnishes and lackers. This is very\r\nfamiliar to the costermonger fraternity as the oil which is burned in the\r\nflaring lamps which illuminate the New Cut or the Elephant and Castle on\r\nSaturday and other market nights.\r\n\r\nBy distillation of the _heavy oils_, carbolic acid and commercial\r\n_anthracene_ are produced, and by a treatment of the residue, a white and\r\ncrystalline substance known as _naphthalin_ (C_{10}H_{8}) is finally\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThus, by the continued operation of the chemical process known as\r\nfractional distillation of the immediate products of coal-tar, these\r\nvarious series of useful oils are prepared.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is much the same which has resulted in the production of\r\nparaffin oil, to which we have previously referred, and an account of the\r\nproduction of coal-oils would be very far from satisfactory, which made\r\nno mention of the production of similar commodities by the direct\r\ndistillation of shale. Oil-shales, or bituminous shales, exist in all\r\nparts of the world, and may be regarded as mineral matter largely\r\nimpregnated by the products of decaying vegetation. They therefore\r\ngreatly resemble some coals, and really only differ therefrom in degree,\r\nin the quantity of vegetable matter which they contain. Into the subject\r\nof the various native petroleums which have been found--for these\r\nrock-oils are better known as petroleums--in South America, in Burmah\r\n(Rangoon Oil), at Baku, and the shores of the Caspian, or in the United\r\nStates of America, we need not enter, except to note that in all\r\nprobability the action of heat on underground bituminous strata of\r\nenormous extent has been the cause of their production, just as on a\r\nsmaller scale the action of artificial heat has forced the reluctant\r\nshale to give up its own burden of mineral oil. However, previous to\r\n1847, although native mineral oil had been for some years a recognised\r\narticle of commerce, the causes which gave rise to the oil-wells, and the\r\nsource, probably a deep-seated one, of the supply of oil, does not appear\r\nto have been well known, or at least was not enquired after. But in that\r\nyear Mr Young, a chemist at Manchester, discovered that by distilling\r\nsome petroleum, which he obtained from a spring at Riddings in\r\nDerbyshire, he was able to procure a light oil, which he used for burning\r\nin lamps, whilst the heavier product which he also obtained proved a most\r\nuseful lubricant for machinery. This naturally distilled oil was soon\r\nfound to be similar to that oil which was noticed dripping from the roof\r\nof a coal-mine. Judging that the coal, being under the influence of heat,\r\nwas the cause of the production of the oil, Mr Young tested this\r\nconclusion by distilling the coal itself. Success attended his endeavour\r\nthus to procure the oil, and indelibly Young stamped his name upon the\r\nroll of famous men, whose industrial inventions have done so much towards\r\nthe accomplishment of the marvellous progress of the present century.\r\nFrom the distillation he obtained the well-known Young's Paraffin Oil,\r\nand the astonishing developments of the process which have taken place\r\nsince he obtained his patent in 1850, for the manufacture of oils and\r\nsolid paraffin, must have been a source of great satisfaction to him\r\nbefore his death, which occurred in 1883.\r\n\r\nCannel coal, Boghead or Bathgate coal, and bituminous shales of various\r\nqualities, have all been requisitioned for the production of oils, and\r\nfrom these various sources the crude naphthas, which bear a variety of\r\nnames according to some peculiarity in their origin, or place of\r\noccurrence, are obtained. Boghead coal, also known as \"Torebanehill\r\nmineral,\" gives Boghead naphtha, while the crude naphtha obtained from\r\nshales is often quoted as shale-oil. In chemical composition these\r\nnaphthas are closely related to one another, and by fractional\r\ndistillation of them similar series of products are obtained as those we\r\nhave already seen as obtained from the crude coal-naphtha of coal-tar.\r\n\r\nIn the direct distillation of cannel-coal for the production of paraffin,\r\nit is necessary that the perpendicular tubes or retorts into which the\r\ncoal is placed be heated only to a certain temperature, which is\r\nconsiderably lower than that applied when the object is the production of\r\ncoal-gas. By this means nearly all the volatile matters pass over in the\r\nform of condensible vapours, and the crude oils are at once formed, from\r\nwhence are obtained at different temperatures various volatile ethers,\r\nbenzene, and artificial turpentine oil or petroleum spirit. After these,\r\nthe well-known safety-burning paraffin oil follows, but it is essential\r\nthat the previous three volatile products be completely cleared first,\r\nsince, mixed with air, they form highly dangerous explosives. To the fact\r\nthat the operation is carried on in the manufactories with great care and\r\naccuracy can only be attributed the comparative rareness of explosions of\r\nthe oil used in households.\r\n\r\nAfter paraffin, the heavy lubricating oils are next given off, still\r\nincreasing the temperature, and, the residue being in turn subjected to a\r\nvery low temperature, the white solid substance known as paraffin, so\r\nmuch used for making candles, is the result. By a different treatment of\r\nthe same residue is produced that wonderful salve for tender skins, cuts,\r\nand burns, known popularly as _vaseline_. Probably no such\r\nwidely-advertised remedial substance has so deserved its success as this\r\nuniversally-used waste product of petroleum.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed the fact that in order to procure safety-burning oils, it\r\nis absolutely necessary that the more volatile portions be completely\r\ndistilled over first. By Act of Parliament a test is applied to all oils\r\nwhich are intended for purposes of illumination, and the test used\r\nconsists of what is known as the flashing-point. Many of the more\r\nvolatile ethers, which are highly inflammable, are given off even at\r\nordinary temperatures, and the application of a light to the oil will\r\ncause the volatile portion to \"flash,\" as it is called. A safety-burning\r\noil, according to the Act, must not flash under 100° Fahrenheit open\r\ntest, and all those portions which flash at a less temperature must be\r\nvolatilised off before the residue can be deemed a safe oil. It seems\r\nprobable that the flashing-point will sooner or later be raised.\r\n\r\nOne instance may be cited to show how necessary it is that the native\r\nmineral oils which have been discovered should have this effectual test\r\napplied to them.\r\n\r\nWhen the oil-wells were first discovered in America, the oil was obtained\r\nsimply by a process of boring, and the fountain of oil which was bored\r\ninto at times was so prolific, that it rushed out with a force which\r\ncarried all obstacles before it, and defied all control. In one instance\r\na column of oil shot into the air to a height of forty feet, and defied\r\nall attempts to keep it under. In order to prevent further accident, all\r\nlights in the immediate neighbourhood were extinguished, the nearest\r\nremaining being at a distance of four hundred feet. But in this crude\r\nnaphtha there was, as usual, a quantity of volatile spirit which was\r\nbeing given off even at the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere.\r\nThis soon became ignited, and with an explosion the column of oil was\r\nsuddenly converted into a roaring column of fire. The owner of the\r\nproperty was thrown a distance of twenty feet by the explosion, and soon\r\nafterwards died from the burns which he had received from it. Such an\r\naccident could not now, however, happen. The tapping, stopping, and\r\nregulating of gushing wells can now be more effectually dealt with, and\r\nin the process of refining; the most inflammable portions are separated,\r\nwith a result that, as no oil is used in the country which flashes under\r\n100° F. open test, and as our normal temperature is considerably less\r\nthan this, there is little to be feared in the way of explosion if the\r\nAct be complied with.\r\n\r\nWhen the results of Mr Young's labours became publicly known, a number of\r\ncompanies were started with the object of working on the lines laid down\r\nin his patent, and these not only in Great Britain but also in the United\r\nStates, whither quantities of cannel coal were shipped from England and\r\nother parts to feed the retorts. In 1860, according to the statistics\r\nfurnished, some seventy factories were established in the United States\r\nalone with the object of extracting oil from coal and other mineral\r\nsources, such as bituminous shale, etc. When Young's patent finally\r\nexpired, a still greater impetus was given to its production, and the\r\nmanufacture would probably have continued to develop were it not that\r\nattention had, two years previously, been forcibly turned to those\r\ndiscoveries of great stores of natural oil in existence beneath a\r\ncomparatively thin crust of earth, and which, when bored into, spouted\r\nout to tremendous heights.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of these oil-fountains checked for a time the development\r\nof the industry, but with the great production there has apparently been\r\na greatly increased demand for it, and the British industry once again\r\nappears to thrive, until even bituminous shales have been brought under\r\nrequisition for their contribution to the national wealth.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the nuisance and difficulty experienced in the proper\r\ncleaning and trimming of lamps, there seems no other reason why mineral\r\noil should not in turn have superseded the use of gas, even as gas had,\r\nyears before, superseded the expensive animal and vegetable oils which\r\nhad formerly been in use.\r\n\r\nAlthough this great development in the use of mineral oils has taken\r\nplace only within the last thirty years, it must not be thought that\r\ntheir use is altogether of modern invention. That they were not\r\naltogether unknown in the fifth century before Christ is a matter of\r\ncertainty, and at the time when the Persian Empire was at the zenith of\r\nits glory, the fires in the temples of the fire-worshippers were\r\nundoubtedly kept fed by the natural petroleum which the districts around\r\nafforded. It is thought by some that the legend which speaks of the fire\r\nwhich came down from heaven, and which lit the altars of the\r\nZoroastrians, may have had its origin in the discovery of a hitherto\r\nunknown petroleum spring. More recently, the remarks of Marco Polo in his\r\naccount of his travels in A.D. 1260 and following years, are particularly\r\ninteresting as showing that, even then, the use of mineral oil for\r\nvarious purposes was not altogether unknown. He says that on the north of\r\nArmenia the Greater is \"Zorzania, in the confines of which a fountain is\r\nfound, from which a liquor like oil flows, and though unprofitable for\r\nthe seasoning of meat, yet is very fit for the supplying of lamps, and to\r\nanoint other things; and this natural oil flows constantly, and that in\r\nplenty enough to lade camels.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this we can infer that the nature of the oil was entirely unknown,\r\nfor it was a \"liquor like oil,\" and was also, strange to say,\r\n\"unprofitable for the seasoning of meat\"! In another place in Armenia,\r\nMarco Polo states that there was a fountain \"whence rises oil in such\r\nabundance that a hundred ships might be at once loaded with it. It is not\r\ngood for eating, but very fit for fuel, for anointing the camels in\r\nmaladies of the skin, and for other purposes; for which reason people\r\ncome from a great distance for it, and nothing else is burned in all this\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nThe remedial effects of the oil, when used as an ointment, were thus\r\nearly recognised, and the far-famed vaseline of the present day may be\r\nregarded as the lineal descendent, so to speak, of the crude medicinal\r\nagent to which Marco Polo refers.\r\n\r\nThe term asphalt has been applied to so many and various mixtures, that\r\none scarcely associates it with natural mineral pitch which is found in\r\nsome parts of the world. From time immemorial this compact, bituminous,\r\nresinous mineral has been discovered in masses on the shores of the Dead\r\nSea, which has in consequence received the well-known title of Lake\r\nAsphaltites. Like the naphthas and petroleums which have been noticed,\r\nthis has had its origin in the decomposition of vegetable matter, and\r\nappears to be thrown up in a liquid form by the volcanic energies which,\r\nare still believed to be active in the centre of the lake, and which may\r\nbe existent beneath a stratum, or bed, of oil-producing bitumen.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the formation of this substance, the remarks of Sir\r\nCharles Lyell, the great geologist, may well be quoted, as showing the\r\ntransformation of vegetable matter into petroleum, and afterwards into\r\nsolid-looking asphalt. At Trinidad is a lake of bitumen which is a mile\r\nand a half in circumference. \"The Orinoco has for ages been rolling down\r\ngreat quantities of woody and vegetable bodies into the surrounding sea,\r\nwhere, by the influence of currents and eddies, they may be arrested, and\r\naccumulated in particular places. The frequent occurrence of earthquakes\r\nand other indications of volcanic action in those parts, lend countenance\r\nto the opinion that these vegetable substances may have undergone, by the\r\nagency of subterranean fire, those transformations or chemical changes\r\nwhich produce petroleum; and this may, by the same causes, be forced up\r\nto the surface, where, by exposure to the air, it becomes inspissated,\r\nand forms those different varieties of earth-pitch or asphaltum so\r\nabundant in the island.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note also that it was obtained, at an ancient\r\nperiod, from the oil-fountains of Is, and that it was put to considerable\r\nuse in the embalming of the bodies of the Egyptians. It appears, too, to\r\nhave been employed in the construction of the walls of Babylon, and thus\r\nfrom very early times these wonderful products and results of decayed\r\nvegetation have been brought into use for the service of man.\r\n\r\nAniline has been previously referred (p. 135) to as having been prepared\r\nfrom nitro-benzole, or _essence de mirbane_, and its preparation, by\r\ntreating this substance with iron-filings and acetic acid, was one of the\r\nearly triumphs of the chemists who undertook the search after the unknown\r\ncontained in gas-tar. It had previously been obtained from oils distilled\r\nfrom bones. The importance of the substance lies in the fact that, by the\r\naction of various chemical reagents, a series of colouring matters of\r\nvery great richness are formed, and these are the well-known _aniline\r\ndyes_.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1836, it was discovered that aniline, when heated with\r\nchloride of lime, acquired a beautiful blue tint. This discovery led to\r\nno immediate practical result, and it was not until twenty-one years\r\nafter that a further discovery was made, which may indeed be said to have\r\nachieved a world-wide reputation. It was found that, by adding bichromate\r\nof potash to a solution of aniline and sulphuric acid, a powder was\r\nobtained from which the dye was afterwards extracted, which is known as\r\n_mauve_. Since that time dyes in all shades and colours have been\r\nobtained from the same source. _Magenta_ was the next dye to make its\r\nappearance, and in the fickle history of fashion, probably no colours\r\nhave had such extraordinary runs of popularity as those of mauve and\r\nmagenta. Every conceivable colour was obtained in due course from the\r\nsame source, and chemists began to suspect that, in the course of time,\r\nthe colouring matter of dyer's madder, which was known as _alizarin_,\r\nwould also be obtained therefrom. Hitherto this had been obtained from\r\nthe root of the madder-plant, but by dint of careful and well-reasoned\r\nresearch, it was obtained by Dr Groebe, from a solid crystalline coal-tar\r\nproduct, known as _anthracene_, (C_{12}H_{14}). This artificial alizarin\r\nyields colours which are purer than those of natural madder, and being\r\nderived from what was originally regarded as a waste product, its cost of\r\nproduction is considerably cheaper.\r\n\r\nWe have endeavoured thus far to deal with (1) gas, and (2) tar, the two\r\nprincipal products in the distillation of coal. We have yet to say a few\r\nwords concerning the useful ammoniacal liquor, and the final residue in\r\nthe retorts, _i.e._, coke.\r\n\r\nThe ammoniacal liquor which has been passing over during distillation of\r\nthe coal, and which has been collecting in the hydraulic main and in\r\nother parts of the gas-making apparatus, is set aside to be treated to a\r\nvariety of chemical reactions, in order to wrench from it its useful\r\nconstituents. Amongst these, of course, _ammonia_ stands in the first\r\nrank, the others being comparatively unimportant. In order to obtain\r\nthis, the liquor is first of all neutralised by being treated with a\r\nquantity of acid, which converts the principal constituent of the liquor,\r\nviz., carbonate of ammonia (smelling salts), into either sulphate of\r\nammonia, or chloride of ammonia, familiarly known as sal-ammoniac,\r\naccording as sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid is the acid used. Thus\r\ncarbonate of ammonia with sulphuric acid will give sulphate of ammonia,\r\nbut carbonate of ammonia with hydrochloric acid will give sal-ammoniac\r\n(chloride of ammonia). By a further treatment of these with lime, or, as\r\nit is chemically known, oxide of calcium, ammonia is set free, whilst\r\nchloride of lime (the well-known disinfectant), or sulphate of lime\r\n(gypsum, or \"plaster of Paris\" ), is the result.\r\n\r\nThus:\r\n\r\nSulphate of ammonia + lime = plaster of Paris + ammonia.\r\n\r\nor,\r\n\r\nSal-ammoniac + lime = chloride of lime + ammonia.\r\n\r\nAmmonia itself is a most powerful gas, and acts rapidly upon the eyes. It\r\nhas a stimulating effect upon the nerves. It is not a chemical element,\r\nbeing composed of three parts of hydrogen by weight to one of nitrogen,\r\nboth of which elements alone are very harmless, and, the latter indeed,\r\nvery necessary to human life. Ammonia is fatal to life, producing great\r\nirritation of the lungs.\r\n\r\nIt has also been called \"hartshorn,\" being obtained by destructive\r\ndistillation of horn and bone. The name \"ammonia\" is said to have been\r\nderived from the fact that it was first obtained by the Arabs near the\r\ntemple of Jupiter Ammon, in Lybia, North Africa, from the excrement of\r\ncamels, in the form of sal-ammoniac. There are always traces of it in the\r\natmosphere, especially in the vicinity of large towns and manufactories\r\nwhere large quantities of coal are burned.\r\n\r\nCoke, if properly prepared, should consist of pure carbon. Good coal\r\nshould yield as much as 80 per cent. of coke, but owing to the\r\nunsatisfactory manner of its production, this proportion is seldom\r\nyielded, whilst the coke which is familiar to householders, being the\r\nresidue left in the retorts after gas-making, usually contains so large a\r\nproportion of sulphur as to make its combustion almost offensive. No\r\ndoubt the result of its unsatisfactory preparation has been that it has\r\nfailed to make its way into households as it should have done, but there\r\nis also another objection to its use, namely, the fact that, owing to the\r\nquantity of oxygen required in its combustion, it gives rise to feelings\r\nof suffocation where insufficient ventilation of the room is provided.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of coke are, however, consumed in the feeding of furnace\r\nfires, and in the heating of boilers of locomotives, as well as in\r\nmetallurgical operations; and in order to supply the demand, large\r\nquantities of coal are \"coked,\" a process by which the volatile products\r\nare completely combusted, pure coke remaining behind. This process is\r\ntherefore the direct opposite to that of \"distillation,\" by which the\r\nvolatile products are carefully collected and re-distilled.\r\n\r\nThe sulphurous impurities which are always present in the coal, and which\r\nare, to a certain extent, retained in coke made at the gas-works,\r\nthemselves have a value, which in these utilitarian days is not long\r\nlikely to escape the attention of capitalists. In coal, bands of bright\r\nshining iron pyrites are constantly seen, even in the homely scuttle, and\r\nwhen coal is washed, as it is in some places, the removal of the pyrites\r\nincreases the value of the coal, whilst it has a value of its own.\r\n\r\nThe conversion of the sulphur which escapes from our chimneys into\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, and then into sulphuric acid, or oil of vitriol,\r\nhas already been referred to, and we can only hope that in these days\r\nwhen every available source of wealth is being looked up, and when there\r\nthreatens to remain nothing which shall in the future be known as\r\n\"waste,\" that the atmosphere will be spared being longer the receptacle\r\nfor the unowned and execrated brimstone of millions of fires and\r\nfurnaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE COAL SUPPLIES OF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs compared with some of the American coal-fields, those of Britain are\r\nbut small, both in extent and thickness. They can be regarded as falling\r\nnaturally into three principal areas.\r\n\r\n  The northern coal-field, including those of Fife, Stirling, and Ayr\r\n    in  Scotland; Cumberland, Newcastle, and Durham in England; Tyrone\r\n    in Ireland.\r\n\r\n  The middle coal-field, all geologically in union, including those of\r\n    Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Flint, and\r\n    Denbigh.\r\n\r\n  The southern coal-field, including South Wales, Forest of Dean,\r\n    Bristol, Dover, with an offshoot at Leinster, &c., and Millstreet,\r\n    Cork.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that while England and Scotland are, in comparison\r\nwith their extent of surface, bountifully supplied with coal-areas, in\r\nthe sister island of Ireland coal-producing areas are almost absent. The\r\nisolated beds in Cork and Tipperary, in Tyrone and Antrim, are but the\r\nremnants left of what were formerly beds of coal extending the whole\r\nbreadth and length of Ireland. Such beds as there remain undoubtedly\r\nbelong to the base of the coal-measures, and observations all go to show\r\nthat the surface suffered such extreme denudation subsequent to the\r\ngrowth of the coal-forests, that the wealth which once lay there, has\r\nbeen swept away from the surface which formerly boasted of it.\r\n\r\nOn the continent of Europe the coal-fields, though not occupying so large\r\na proportion of the surface of the country as in England, are very far\r\nfrom being slight or to be disregarded. The extent of forest-lands still\r\nremaining in Germany and Austria are sufficing for the immediate needs of\r\nthe districts where some of the best seams occur. It is only where there\r\nis a dearth of handy fuel, ready to be had, perhaps, by the simple\r\nfelling of a few trees, that man commences to dig into the earth for his\r\nfuel. But although on the continent not yet occupying so prominent a\r\nposition in public estimation as do coal-fields in Great Britain, those\r\nof the former have one conspicuous characteristic, viz., the great\r\nthickness of some of the individual seams.\r\n\r\nIn the coal-field of Midlothian the seams of coal vary from 2 feet to 5\r\nfeet in thickness. One of them is known as the \"great seam,\" and in spite\r\nof its name attains a thickness only of from 8 to 10 feet thick. There\r\nare altogether about thirty seams of coal. When, however, we pass to the\r\ncontinent, we find many instances, such as that of the coal-field of\r\nCentral France, in which the seams attain vast thicknesses, many of them\r\nactually reaching 40 and 60 feet, and sometimes even 80 feet. One of the\r\nseams in the district of St. Etienne varies from 30 to 70 feet thick,\r\nwhilst the fifteen to eighteen workable seams give a thickness of 112\r\nfeet, although the total area of the field is not great. Again, in the\r\nremarkable basin of the Saône-et-Loire, although there are but ten beds\r\nof coal, two of them run from 30 to 60 feet each, whilst at Creusot the\r\nmain seam actually runs locally to a thickness varying between 40 and 130\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian coal-field stretches in the form of a narrow strip from 7 to\r\n9 miles wide by about 100 miles long, and is divided into three principal\r\nbasins. In that stretching from Liége to Verviers there are eighty-three\r\nseams of coal, none of which are less than 3 feet thick. In the basin of\r\nthe Sambre, stretching from Namur to Charleroi, there are seventy-three\r\nseams which are workable, whilst in that between Mons and Thulin there\r\nare no less than one hundred and fifty-seven seams. The measures here are\r\nso folded in zigzag fashion, that in boring in the neighbourhood of Mons\r\nto a depth of 350 yards vertical, a single seam was passed through no\r\nless than six times.\r\n\r\nGermany, on the west side of the Rhine, is exceptionally fortunate in the\r\npossession of the famous Pfalz-Saarbrücken coal-field, measuring about 60\r\nmiles long by 20 miles wide, and covering about 175 square miles. Much of\r\nthe coal which lies deep in these coal-measures will always remain\r\nunattainable, owing to the enormous thickness of the strata, but a\r\ncareful computation made of the coal which can be worked, gives an\r\nestimate of no less than 2750 millions of tons. There is a grand total of\r\ntwo hundred and forty-four seams, although about half of them are\r\nunworkable.\r\n\r\nBeside other smaller coal-producing areas in Germany, the coal-fields of\r\nSilesia in the southeastern corner of Prussia are a possession unrivalled\r\nboth on account of their extent and thickness. It is stated that there\r\nexist 333 feet of coal, all the seams of which exceed 2-1/2 feet, and\r\nthat in the aggregate there is here, within a workable depth, the\r\nscarcely conceivable quantity of 50,000 million tons of coal.\r\n\r\nThe coal-field of Upper Silesia, occupying an area about 20 miles long by\r\n15 miles broad, is estimated to contain some 10,000 feet of strata, with\r\n333 feet of good coal. This is about three times the thickness contained\r\nin the South Wales coal-field, in a similar thickness of coal-measures.\r\nThere are single seams up to 60 feet thick, but much of the coal is\r\ncovered by more recent rocks of New Red and Cretaceous age. In Lower\r\nSilesia there are numerous seams 3-1/2 feet to 5 feet thick, but owing to\r\ntheir liability to change in character even in the same seam, their value\r\nis inferior to the coals of Upper Silesia.\r\n\r\nWhen British supplies are at length exhausted, we may anticipate that\r\nsome of the earliest coals to be imported, should coal then be needed,\r\nwill reach Britain from the upper waters of the Oder.\r\n\r\nThe coal-field of Westphalia has lately come into prominence in\r\nconnection with the search which has been made for coal in Kent and\r\nSurrey, the strata which are mined at Dortmund being thought to be\r\ncontinuous from the Bristol coal-field. Borings have been made through\r\nthe chalk of the district north of the Westphalian coal-field, and these\r\nhave shown the existence of further coal-measures. The coal-field extends\r\nbetween Essen and Dortmund a distance of 30 miles east and west, and\r\nexhibits a series of about one hundred and thirty seams, with an\r\naggregate of 300 feet of coal.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that this coal-field alone contains no less than 39,200\r\nmillions of tons of coal.\r\n\r\nRussia possesses supplies of coal whose influence has scarcely yet been\r\nfelt, owing to the sparseness of the population and the abundance of\r\nforest. Carboniferous rocks abut against the flanks of the Ural\r\nMountains, along the sides of which they extend for a length of about a\r\nthousand miles, with inter-stratifications of coal. Their actual contents\r\nhave not yet been gauged, but there is every reason to believe that those\r\ncoal-beds which have been seen are but samples of many others which will,\r\nwhen properly worked, satisfy the needs of a much larger population than\r\nthe country now possesses.\r\n\r\nLike the lower coals of Scotland, the Russian coals are found in the\r\ncarboniferous limestone. This may also be said of the coal-fields in the\r\ngovernments of Tula and Kaluga, and of those important coal-bearing\r\nstrata near the river Donetz, stretching to the northern corner of the\r\nSea of Azov. In the last-named, the seams are spread over an area of\r\n11,000 square miles, in which there are forty-four workable seams\r\ncontaining 114 feet of coal. The thickest of known Russian coals occur at\r\nLithwinsk, where three seams are worked, each measuring 30 feet to 40\r\nfeet thick.\r\n\r\nAn extension of the Upper Silesian coal-field appears in Russian Poland.\r\nThis is of upper Carboniferous age, and contains an aggregate of 60 feet\r\nof coal.\r\n\r\nAt Ostrau, in Upper Silesia (Austria), there is a remarkable coal-field.\r\nOf its 370 seams there are no less than 117 workable ones, and these\r\ncontain 350 feet of coal. The coals here are very full of gas, which even\r\npercolates to the cellars of houses in the town. A bore hole which was\r\nsunk in 1852 to a depth of 150 feet, gave off a stream of gas, which\r\nignited, and burnt for many years with a flame some feet long.\r\n\r\nThe Zwickau coal-field in Saxony is one of the most important in Europe.\r\nIt contains a remarkable seam of coal, known as Russokohle or soot-coal,\r\nrunning at times 25 feet thick. It was separated by Geinitz and others\r\ninto four zones, according to their vegetable contents, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1. Zone of Ferns.\r\n\r\n2. Zone of Annularia and Calamites.\r\n\r\n3. Zone of Sigillaria.\r\n\r\n4. Zone of Sagenaria (in Silesia), equivalent to the culm-measures of\r\n   Devonshire.\r\n\r\nCoals belonging to other than true Carboniferous age are found in Europe\r\nat Steyerdorf on the Danube, where there are a few seams of good coal in\r\nstrata of Liassic age, and in Hungary and Styria, where there are\r\ntertiary coals which approach closely to those of true Carboniferous age\r\nin composition and quality.\r\n\r\nIn Spain there are a few small scattered basins. Coal is found overlying\r\nthe carboniferous limestone of the Cantabrian chain, the seams being from\r\n5 feet to 8 feet thick. In the Satero valley, near Sotillo, is a single\r\nseam measuring from 60 feet to 100 feet thick. Coal of Neocomian age\r\nappears at Montalban.\r\n\r\nWhen we look outside the continent of Europe, we may well be astonished\r\nat the bountiful manner in which nature has laid out beds of coal upon\r\nthese ancient surfaces of our globe.\r\n\r\nProfessor Rogers estimated that, in the United States of America, the\r\ncoal-fields occupy an area of no less than 196,850 square miles.\r\n\r\nHere, again, it is extremely probable that the coal-fields which remain,\r\nin spite of their gigantic existing areas, are but the remnants of one\r\ntremendous area of deposit, bounded only on the east by the Atlantic, and\r\non the west by a line running from the great lakes to the frontiers of\r\nMexico. The whole area has been subjected to forces which have produced\r\nfoldings and flexures in the Carboniferous strata after deposition. These\r\nundulations are greatest near the Alleghanies, and between these\r\nmountains and the Atlantic, whilst the flexures gradually dying out\r\nwestward, cause the strata there to remain fairly horizontal. In the\r\ntroughs of the foldings thus formed the coal-measures rest, those\r\nportions which had been thrown up as anticlines having suffered loss by\r\ndenudation. Where the foldings are greatest there the coal has been\r\nnaturally most altered; bituminous and caking-coals are characteristic of\r\nthe broad flat areas west of the mountains, whilst, where the contortions\r\nare greatest, the coal becomes a pure anthracite.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that in this huge area the coal is all uniformly\r\ngood. It varies greatly in quality, and in some districts it occurs in\r\nsuch thin seams as to be worthless, except as fuel for consumption by the\r\nactual coal-getters. There are, too, areas of many square miles in\r\nextent, where there are now no coals at all, the formation having been\r\ndenuded right down to the palaeozoic back-bone of the country.\r\n\r\nAmongst the actual coal-fields, that of Pennsylvania stands\r\npre-eminent. The anthracite here is in inexhaustible quantity, its output\r\nexceeding that of the ordinary bituminous coal. The great field of which\r\nthis is a portion, extends in an unbroken length for 875 miles N.E. and\r\nS.W., and includes the basins of Ohio, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and\r\nTennessee. The workable seams of anthracite about Pottsville measure in\r\nthe aggregate from 70 to 207 feet. Some of the lower seams individually\r\nattain an exceptional thickness, that at Lehigh Summit mine containing a\r\nseam, or rather a bed, of 30 feet of good coal.\r\n\r\nA remarkable seam of coal has given the town of Pittsburg its name. This\r\nis 8 feet thick at its outcrop near the town, and although its thickness\r\nvaries considerably, Professor Rogers estimates that the sheet of coal\r\nmeasures superficially about 14,000 square miles. What a forest there\r\nmust have existed to produce so widespread a bed! Even as it is, it has\r\nat a former epoch suffered great denudation, if certain detached basins\r\nshould be considered as indicating its former extent.\r\n\r\nThe principal seam in the anthracite district of central Pennsylvania,\r\nwhich extends for about 650 miles along the left bank of the Susquehanna,\r\nis known as the \"Mammoth\" vein, and is 29-1/2 feet thick at Wilkesbarre,\r\nwhilst at other places it attains to, and even exceeds, 60 feet.\r\n\r\nOn the west of the chain of mountains the foldings become gentler, and\r\nthe coal assumes an almost horizontal position. In passing through Ohio\r\nwe find a saddle-back ridge or anticline of more ancient strata than the\r\ncoal, and in consequence of this, we have a physical boundary placed upon\r\nthe coal-fields on each side.\r\n\r\nPassing across this older ridge of denuded Silurian and other rocks, we\r\nreach the famous Illinois and Indiana coal-field, whose\r\ncoal-measures lie in a broad trough, bounded on the west by the uprising\r\nof the carboniferous limestone of the upper Mississippi. This limestone\r\nformation appears here for the first time, having been absent on the\r\neastern side of the Ohio anticline. The area of the coal-field is\r\nestimated at 51,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the coal-fields of the United States, it is\r\ninteresting to notice that a wide area in Texas, estimated at 3000 square\r\nmiles, produces a large amount of coal annually from strata of the\r\nLiassic age. Another important area of production in eastern Virginia\r\ncontains coal referable to the Jurassic age, and is similar in fossil\r\ncontents to the Jurassic of Whitby and Brora. The main seam in eastern\r\nVirginia boasts a thickness of from 30 to 40 feet of good coal.\r\n\r\nVery serviceable lignites of Cretaceous age are found on the Pacific\r\nslope, to which age those of Vancouver's Island and Saskatchewan River\r\nare referable.\r\n\r\nOther coal-fields of less importance are found between Lakes Huron and\r\nErie, where the measures cover an area of 5000 square miles, and also in\r\nRhode Island.\r\n\r\nIn British North America we find extensive deposits of valuable\r\ncoal-measures. Large developments occur in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.\r\nAt South Joggins there is a thickness of 14,750 feet of strata, in which\r\nare found seventy-six coal-seams of 45 feet in total thickness. At Picton\r\nthere are six seams with a total of 80 feet of coal. In the lower\r\ncarboniferous group is found the peculiar asphaltic coal of the Albert\r\nmine in New Brunswick. Extensive deposits of lignite are met with both in\r\nthe Dominion and in the United States, whilst true coal-measures flank\r\nboth sides of the Rocky Mountains. Coal-seams are often encountered in\r\nthe Arctic archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe principal areas of deposit in South America are in Brazil, Uruguay,\r\nand Peru. The largest is the Candiota coal-field, in Brazil, where\r\nsections in the valley of the Candiota River show five good seams with a\r\ntotal of 65 feet of coal. It is, however, worked but little, the\r\nprincipal workings being at San Jeronimo on the Jacahahay River.\r\n\r\nIn Peru the true carboniferous coal-seams are found on the higher ground\r\nof the Andes, whilst coal of secondary age is found in considerable\r\nquantities on the rise towards the mountains. At Porton, east of\r\nTruxillo, the same metamorphism which has changed the ridge of sandstone\r\nto a hard quartzite has also changed the ordinary bituminous coal into an\r\nanthracite, which is here vertical in position. The coals of Peru usually\r\nrise to more than 10,000 feet above the sea, and they are practically\r\ninaccessible.\r\n\r\nCretaceous coals have been found at Lota in Chili, and at Sandy Point,\r\nStraits of Magellan.\r\n\r\nTurning to Asia, we find that coal has been worked from time to time at\r\nHeraclea in Asia Minor. Lignites are met with at Smyrna and Lebanon.\r\n\r\nThe coal-fields of Hindoostan are small but numerous, being found in all\r\nparts of the peninsula. There is an important coal-field at Raniganj,\r\nnear the Hooghly, 140 miles north of Calcutta. It has an area of 500\r\nsquare miles. In the Raniganj district there are occasional seams 20 feet\r\nto 80 feet in thickness, but the coals are of somewhat inferior quality.\r\n\r\nThe best quality amongst Indian coals has come from a small coal-field of\r\nabout 11 square miles in extent, situated at Kurhurbali on the East\r\nIndian Railway. Other coal-fields are found at Jherria and on the Sone\r\nRiver, in Bengal, and at Mopani on the Nerbudda. Much is expected in\r\nfuture from the large coal-field of the Wardha and Chanda districts, in\r\nthe Central Provinces, the coal of which may eventually prove to be of\r\nPermian age.\r\n\r\nThe coal-deposits of China are undoubtedly of tremendous extent, although\r\nfrom want of exploration it is difficult to form any satisfactory\r\nestimate of them. Near Pekin there are beds of coal 95 feet thick, which\r\nafford ample provision for the needs of the city. In the mountainous\r\ndistricts of western China the area over which carboniferous strata are\r\nexposed has been estimated at 100,000 square miles. The coal-measures\r\nextend westward to the Mongolian frontier, where coal-seams 30 feet thick\r\nare known to lie in horizontal plane for 200 miles. Most of the Chinese\r\ncoal-deposits are rendered of small value, either owing to the\r\nmountainous nature of the valleys in which they outcrop, or to their\r\ninaccessibility from the sea. Japan is not lacking in good supplies of\r\ncoal. A colliery is worked by the government on the island of Takasima,\r\nnear Nagasaki, for the supply of coals for the use of the navy.\r\n\r\nThe British possession of Labuan, off the island of Borneo, is rich in a\r\ncoal of tertiary age, remarkable for the quantity of fossil resin which,\r\nit contains. Coal is also found in Sumatra, and in the Malayan\r\nArchipelago.\r\n\r\nIn Cape Colony and Natal the coal-bearing Karoo beds are probably of New\r\nRed age. The coal is reported to be excellent in quantity.\r\n\r\nIn Abyssinia lignites are frequently met with in the high lands of the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nCoal is very extensively developed throughout Australasia. In New South\r\nWales, coal-measures occur in large detached portions between 29° and 35°\r\nS. latitude. The Newcastle district, at the mouth of the Hunter river, is\r\nthe chief seat of the coal trade, and the seams are here found up to 30\r\nfeet thick. Coal-bearing strata are found at Bowen River, in Queensland,\r\ncovering an area of 24,000 square miles, whilst important mines of\r\nCretaceous age are worked at Ipswich, near Brisbane. In New Zealand\r\nquantities of lignite, described as a hydrous coal, are found and\r\nutilised; also an anhydrous coal which may prove to be either of\r\nCretaceous or Jurassic age.\r\n\r\nWe have thus briefly sketched the supplies of coal, so far as they are\r\nknown, which are to be found in various countries. But England has of\r\nlate years been concerned as to the possible failure of her home supplies\r\nin the not very distant future, and the effects which such failure would\r\nbe likely to produce on the commercial prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain has long been the centre of the universe in the supply of\r\nthe world's coal, and as a matter of fact, has been for many years\r\nraising considerably more than one half of the total amount of coal\r\nraised throughout the whole world. There is, as we have seen, an\r\nabundance of coal elsewhere, which will, in the course of time, compete\r\nwith her when properly worked, but Britain seems to have early taken the\r\nlead in the production of coal, and to have become the great universal\r\ncoal distributor. Those who have misgivings as to what will happen when\r\nher coal is exhausted, receive little comfort from the fact that in North\r\nAmerica, in Prussia, in China and elsewhere, there are tremendous\r\nsupplies of coal as yet untouched, although a certain sense of relief is\r\nexperienced when that fact becomes generally known.\r\n\r\nIf by the time of exhaustion of the home mines Britain is still dependent\r\nupon coal for fuel, which, in this age of electricity, scarcely seems\r\nprobable, her trade and commerce will feel with tremendous effect the\r\nblow which her prestige will experience when the first vessel, laden with\r\nforeign coal, weighs anchor in a British harbour. In the great coal\r\nlock-out of 1893, when, for the greater part of sixteen weeks scarcely a\r\nton of coal reached the surface in some of her principal coal-fields, it\r\nwas rumoured, falsely as it appeared, that a collier from America had\r\nindeed reached those shores, and the importance which attached to the\r\nsupposed event was shown by the anxious references to it in the public\r\npress, where the truth or otherwise of the alarm was actively discussed.\r\nShould such a thing at any time actually come to pass, it will indeed be\r\na retribution to those who have for years been squandering their\r\ninheritance in many a wasteful manner of coal-consumption.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago, when so much small coal was wasted and wantonly\r\nconsumed in order to dispose of it in the easiest manner possible at the\r\npitmouths, and when only the best and largest coal was deemed to be of\r\nany value, louder and louder did scientific men speak in protest against\r\nthis great and increasing prodigality. Wild estimates were set on foot\r\nshowing how that, sooner or later, there would be in Britain no native\r\nsupply of coal at all, and finally a Royal Commission was appointed in\r\n1866, to collect evidence and report upon the probable time during which\r\nthe supplies of Great Britain would last.\r\n\r\nThis Commission reported in 1871, and the outcome of it was that a period\r\nof twelve hundred and seventy-three years was assigned as the period\r\nduring which the coal would last, at the then-existing rate of\r\nconsumption. The quantity of workable coal within a depth of 4000 feet\r\nwas estimated to be 90,207 millions of tons, or, including that at\r\ngreater depths, 146,480 millions of tons. Since that date, however, there\r\nhas been a steady annual increase in the amount of coal consumed, and\r\nsubsequent estimates go to show that the supplies cannot last for more\r\nthan 250 years, or, taking into consideration a possible decrease in\r\nconsumption, 350 years. Most of the coal-mines will, indeed, have been\r\nworked out in less than a hundred years hence, and then, perhaps, the\r\ncompetition brought about by the demand for, and the scarcity of, coal\r\nfrom the remaining mines, will have resulted in the dreaded importation\r\nof coal from abroad.\r\n\r\nIn referring to the outcome of the Royal Commission of 1866, although the\r\nCommissioners fixed so comparatively short a period as the probable\r\nduration of the coal supplies, it is but fair that it should be stated\r\nthat other estimates have been made which have materially differed from\r\ntheir estimate. Whereas one estimate more than doubled that of the Royal\r\nCommission, that of Sir William Armstrong in 1863 gave it as 212 years,\r\nand Professor Jevons, speaking in 1875 concerning Armstrong's estimate,\r\nobserved that the annual increase in the amount used, which was allowed\r\nfor in the estimate, had so greatly itself increased, that the 212 years\r\nmust be considerably reduced.\r\n\r\nOne can scarcely thoroughly appreciate the enormous quantity of coal that\r\nis brought to the surface annually, and the only wonder is that there are\r\nany supplies left at all. The Great Pyramid which is said by Herodotus to\r\nhave been twenty years in building, and which took 100,000 men to build,\r\ncontains 3,394,307 cubic yards of stone. The coal raised in 1892 would\r\nmake a pyramid which would contain 181,500,000 cubic yards, at the low\r\nestimate that one ton could be squeezed into one cubic yard.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the quantity of coal which has been raised in succeeding\r\nyears can well be seen from the following facts.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 there were raised  in Great Britain about 20 millions of tons. By\r\n1855 this amount had increased to 64-1/2 millions. In 1865 this again had\r\nincreased to 98 millions, whilst twenty years after, viz., in 1885, this\r\nhad increased to no less than 159 millions, such were the giant strides\r\nwhich the increase in consumption made.\r\n\r\nIn the return for 1892, this amount had farther increased to 181-1/2\r\nmillions of tons, an advance in eight years of a quantity more than equal\r\nto the total raised in 1820, and in 1894 the total reached\r\n199-1/2 millions; this was produced by 795,240 persons, employed in and\r\nabout the mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE COAL-TAR COLOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a former chapter some slight reference has been made to those\r\nbye-products of coal-tar which have proved so valuable in the production\r\nof the aniline dyes. It is thought that the subject is of so interesting\r\na nature as to deserve more notice than it was possible to bestow upon it\r\nin that place. With abstruse chemical formulae and complex chemical\r\nequations it is proposed to have as little as possible to do, but even\r\nthe most unscientific treatment of the subject must occasionally\r\nnecessitate a scientific method of elucidation.\r\n\r\nThe dyeing industry has been radically changed during the last half\r\ncentury by the introduction of what are known as the _artificial_ dyes,\r\nwhilst the _natural_ colouring matters which had previously been the sole\r\nbasis of the industry, and which had been obtained by very simple\r\nchemical methods from some of the constituents of the animal kingdom, or\r\nwhich were found in a natural state in the vegetable kingdom, have very\r\nlargely given place to those which have been obtained from coal-tar, a\r\nproduct of the mineralised vegetation of the carboniferous age.\r\n\r\nThe development and discovery of the aniline colouring matters were not,\r\nof course, possible until after the extensive adoption of\r\nhouse-gas for illuminating purposes, and even then it was many years\r\nbefore the waste products from the gas-works came to have an appreciable\r\nvalue of their own. This, however, came with the increased utilitarianism\r\nof the commerce of the present century, but although aniline was first\r\ndiscovered in 1826 by Unverdorben, in the materials produced by the dry\r\ndistillation of indigo (Portuguese, _anil_, indigo), it was not until\r\nthirty years afterwards, namely, in 1856, that the discovery of the\r\nmethod of manufacture of the first aniline dye, mauveine, was announced,\r\nthe discovery being due to the persistent efforts of Perkin, to whom,\r\ntogether with other chemists working in the same field, is due the great\r\nadvance which has been made in the chemical knowledge of the carbon,\r\nhydrogen, and oxygen compounds. Scientists appeared to work along two\r\nplanes; there were those who discovered certain chemical compounds in the\r\nresulting products of reactions in the treatment of _existing_\r\nvegetation, and there were those who, studying the wonderful constituents\r\nin coal-tar, the product of a _past_ age, immediately set to work to find\r\ntherein those compounds which their contemporaries had already\r\ndiscovered. Generally, too, with signal success.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of benzene in 1825 by Faraday was followed in the course of\r\na few years by its discovery in coal-tar by Hofmann. Toluene, which was\r\ndiscovered in 1837 by Pelletier, was recognised in the fractional\r\ndistillation of crude naphtha by Mansfield in 1848. Although the method\r\nof production of mauveine on a large scale was not accomplished until\r\n1856, yet it had been noticed in 1834, the actual year of its recognition\r\nas a constituent of coal-tar, that, when brought into contact with\r\nchloride of lime, it gave brilliant colours, but it required a\r\nconsiderable cheapening of the process of aniline manufacture before the\r\ndyes commenced to enter into competition with the old natural dyes.\r\n\r\nThe isolation of aniline from coal-tar is expensive, in consequence of\r\nthe small quantities in which it is there found, but it was discovered by\r\nMitscherlich that by acting upon benzene, one of the early distillates of\r\ncoal-tar, for the production of nitro-benzole, a compound was produced\r\nfrom which aniline could be obtained in large quantities. There were thus\r\ntwo methods of obtaining aniline from tar, the experimental and the\r\npractical.\r\n\r\nIn producing nitrobenzole (nitrobenzene), chemically represented as\r\n(C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2}), the nitric acid used as the reagent with benzene, is\r\nmixed with a quantity of sulphuric acid, with the object of absorbing\r\nwater which is formed during the reaction, as this would tend to dilute\r\nthe efficiency of the nitric acid. The proportions are 100 parts of\r\npurified benzene, with a mixture of 115 parts of concentrated nitric acid\r\n(HNO_{3}) and 160 parts of concentrated sulphuric acid. The mixture is\r\ngradually introduced into the large cast-iron cylinder into which the\r\nbenzene has been poured. The outside of the cylinder is supplied with an\r\narrangement by which fine jets of water can be made to play upon it in\r\nthe early stages of the reaction which follows, and at the end of from\r\neight to ten hours the contents are allowed to run off into a storage\r\nreservoir. Here they arrange themselves into two layers, the top of which\r\nconsists of the nitrobenzene which has been produced, together with some\r\nbenzene which is still unacted upon. The mixture is then freed from the\r\nlatter by treatment with a current of steam. Nitrobenzene presents itself\r\nas a yellowish oily liquid, with a peculiar taste as of bitter almonds.\r\nIt was formerly in great demand by perfumers, but its poisonous\r\nproperties render it a dangerous substance to deal with. In practice a\r\ngiven quantity of benzene will yield about 150 per cent of nitrobenzene.\r\nStated chemically, the reaction is shown by the following equation:--\r\n\r\nC_{6}H_{6}    +    HNO_{3}    =    C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2},    +  H_{2}O\r\n(Benzene)       (Nitric acid)       (Nitrobenzene)         (Water).\r\n\r\nThe water which is thus formed in the process, by the freeing of one of\r\nthe atoms of hydrogen in the benzene, is absorbed by the sulphuric acid\r\npresent, although the latter takes no actual part in the reaction.\r\n\r\nFrom the nitrobenzene thus obtained, the aniline which is now used so\r\nextensively is prepared. The component atoms of a molecule of aniline are\r\nshown in the formula C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2}. It is also known as phenylamine or\r\namido-benzole, or commercially as aniline oil. There are various methods\r\nof reducing nitrobenzene for aniline, the object being to replace the\r\noxygen of the former by an equivalent number of atoms of hydrogen. The\r\nprocess generally used is that known as Béchamp's, with slight\r\nmodifications. Equal volumes of nitrobenzene and acetic acid, together\r\nwith a quantity of iron-filings rather in excess of the weight of the\r\nnitrobenzene, are placed in a capacious retort. A brisk effervescence\r\nensues, and to moderate the increase of temperature which is caused by\r\nthe reaction, it is found necessary to cool the retort. Instead of acetic\r\nacid hydrochloric acid has been a good deal used, with, it is said,\r\ncertain advantageous results. From 60 to 65 per cent. of aniline on the\r\nquantity of nitrobenzene used, is yielded by Béchamp's process.\r\n\r\nStated in a few words, the above is the process adopted on all hands for\r\nthe production of commercial aniline, or aniline oil. The details of the\r\ndistillation and rectification of the oil are, however, as varied as they\r\ncan well be, no two manufacturers adopting the same process. Many of the\r\naniline dyes depend entirely for their superiority, on the quality of the\r\noil used, and for this reason it is subject to one or more processes of\r\nrectification. This is performed by distilling, the distillates at the\r\nvarious temperatures being separately collected.\r\n\r\nWhen pure, aniline is a colourless oily liquid, but on exposure rapidly\r\nturns brown. It has strong refracting powers and an agreeable aromatic\r\nsmell. It is very poisonous when taken internally; its sulphate is,\r\nhowever, sometimes used medicinally. It is by the action upon aniline of\r\ncertain oxidising agents, that the various colouring matters so well\r\nknown as aniline dyes are obtained.\r\n\r\nCommercial aniline oil is not, as we have seen, the purest form of\r\nrectified aniline. The aniline oils of commerce are very variable in\r\ncharacter, the principal constituents being pure aniline, para- and\r\nmeta-toluidine, xylidines, and cumidines. They are best known to the\r\ncolour manufacturer in four qualities--\r\n\r\n(_a_) Aniline oil for blue and black.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Aniline oil for magenta.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Aniline oil for safranine.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Liquid toluidine.\r\n\r\nFrom the first of these, which is almost pure aniline, aniline black is\r\nderived, and a number of organic compounds which are further used for the\r\nproduction of dyes. The hydrochloride of aniline is important and is\r\nknown commercially as \"aniline salt.\"\r\n\r\nThe distillation and rectification of aniline oil is practised on a\r\nsimilar principle to the fractional distillation which we have noticed as\r\nbeing used for the distillation of the naphthas. First, light aniline\r\noils pass over, followed by others, and finally by the heavy oils, or\r\n\"aniline-tailings.\" It is a matter of great necessity to those engaged in\r\ncolour manufacture to apply that quality oil which is best for the\r\nproduction of the colour required. This is not always an easy matter, and\r\nthere is great divergence of opinion and in practice on these points.\r\n\r\nThe so-called aniline colours are not all derived from aniline, such\r\ncolouring matters being in some cases derived from other coal-tar\r\nproducts, such as benzene and toluene, phenol, naphthalene, and\r\nanthracene, and it is remarkable that although the earlier dyes were\r\nproduced from the lighter and more easily distilled products of\r\ncoal-tar, yet now some of the heaviest and most stubborn of the\r\ndistillates are brought under requisition for colouring matters, those\r\nwhich not many years ago were regarded as fit only to be used as\r\nlubricants or to be regarded as waste.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary or advisable in a work of this kind to pursue\r\nthe many chemical reactions, which, from the various acids and bases,\r\nresult ultimately in the many shades and gradations of colour which are\r\nto be seen in dress and other fabrics. Many of them, beautiful in the\r\nextreme, are the outcome of much careful and well-planned study, and to\r\nprint here the complicated chemical formulae which show the great changes\r\ntaking place in compounds of complex molecules, or to mention even the\r\nnames of these many-syllabled compounds, would be to destroy the purpose\r\nof this little book. The Rosanilines, the Indulines, and Safranines; the\r\nOxazines, the Thionines: the Phenol and Azo dyes are all substances which\r\nare of greater interest to the chemical students and to the colour\r\nmanufacturer than to the ordinary reader. Many of the names of the bases\r\nof various dyes are unknown outside the chemical dyeworks, although each\r\nand all have complicated; reactions of their own. In the reds are\r\nrosanilines, toluidine xylidine, &c.; in the blues--phenyl-rosanilines,\r\ndiphenylamine, toluidine, aldehyde, &c.; violets--rosaniline, mauve,\r\nphenyl, ethyl, methyl, &c.; greens--iodine, aniline, leucaniline,\r\nchrysotoluidine, aldehyde, toluidine, methyl-anilinine, &c.; yellows and\r\norange--leucaniline, phenylamine, &c.; browns--chrysotoluidine, &c.;\r\nblacks--aniline, toluidine, &c.\r\n\r\nTo take the rosanilines as an instance of the rest.\r\n\r\nAniline red, magenta, azaleine, rubine, solferino, fuchsine, chryaline,\r\nroseine, erythrobenzine, and others, are colouring matters in this group\r\nwhich are salts of rosaniline, and which are all recognised in commerce.\r\n\r\nThe base rosaniline is known chemically by the formula C_{20}H_{l9}N_{3},\r\nand is prepared by heating a mixture of magenta aniline, toluidine, and\r\npseudotoluidine, with arsenic acid and other oxidising agents. It is\r\nimportant that water should be used in such quantities as to prevent the\r\nsolution of arsenic acid from depositing crystals on cooling. Unless\r\ncarefully crystallised rosaniline will contain a slight proportion of the\r\narseniate, and when articles of clothing are dyed with the salt, it is\r\nlikely to produce an inflammatory condition of skin, when worn. Some\r\nyears ago there was a great outcry against hose and other articles dyed\r\nwith aniline dyes, owing to the bad effects which were produced, and this\r\nhas no doubt proved very prejudicial to aniline dyes as a whole.\r\n\r\nAgain, the base known as mauve, or mauveine, has a composition shown by\r\nthe formula C_{27}H_{24}N_{4}. It is produced from the sulphate of\r\naniline by mixing it with a cold saturated solution of bichromate of\r\npotash, and allowing the mixture to stand for ten or twelve hours. A\r\nblue-black precipitate is then formed, which, after undergoing a process\r\nof purification, is dissolved in alcohol and evaporated to dryness. A\r\nmetallic-looking powder is then obtained, which constitutes this\r\nall-important base. Mauve forms with acids a series of well-defined salts\r\nand is capable of expelling ammonia from its combinations. Mauve was the\r\nfirst aniline dye which was produced on a large scale, this being\r\naccomplished by Perkin in 1856.\r\n\r\nThe substance known as carbolic acid is so useful a product of a piece of\r\ncoal that a description of the method of its production must necessarily\r\nhave a place here. It is one of the most powerful antiseptic agents with\r\nwhich we are acquainted, and has strong anaesthetic qualities. Some\r\nuseful dyes are also obtained from it. It is obtained in quantities from\r\ncoal-tar, that portion of the distillate known as the light oils being\r\nits immediate source. The tar oil is mixed with a solution of caustic\r\nsoda, and the mixture is violently agitated. This results in the caustic\r\nsoda dissolving out the carbolic acid, whilst the undissolved oils\r\ncollect upon the surface, allowing the alkaline solution to be drawn from\r\nbeneath. The soda in the solution is then neutralised by the addition of\r\na suitable quantity of sulphuric acid, and the salt so formed sinks while\r\nthe carbolic acid rises to the surface.\r\n\r\nPurification of the product is afterwards carried out by a process of\r\nfractional distillation. There are various other methods of preparing\r\ncarbolic acid.\r\n\r\nCarbolic acid is known chemically as C_{6}H_{5}(HO). When pure it appears\r\nas colourless needle-like crystals, and is exceedingly poisonous. It has\r\nbeen used with marked success in staying the course of disease, such as\r\ncholera and cattle plague. It is of a very volatile nature, and its\r\nefficacy lies in its power of destroying germs as they float in the\r\natmosphere. Modern science tells us that all diseases have their origin\r\nin certain germs which are everywhere present and which seek only a\r\nsuitable _nidus_ in which to propagate and flourish. Unlike mere\r\ndeodorisers which simply remove noxious gases or odours; unlike\r\ndisinfectants which prevent the spread of infection, carbolic acid\r\nstrikes at the very root and origin of disease by oxidising and consuming\r\nthe germs which breed it. So powerful is it that one part in five\r\nthousand parts of flour paste, blood, &c., will for months prevent\r\nfermentation and putrefaction, whilst a little of its vapour in the\r\natmosphere will preserve meat, as well as prevent it from becoming\r\nfly-blown. Although it has, in certain impure states, a slightly\r\ndisagreeable odour, this is never such as to be in any way harmful,\r\nwhilst on the other hand it is said to act as a tonic to those connected\r\nwith its preparation and use.\r\n\r\nThe new artificial colouring matters which are continually being brought\r\ninto the market, testify to the fact that, even with the many beautiful\r\ntints and hues which have been discovered, finality and perfection have\r\nnot yet been reached. A good deal of popular prejudice has arisen against\r\ncertain aniline dyes on account of their inferiority to many of the old\r\ndye-stuffs in respect to their fastness, but in recent years the\r\nmanufacture of many which were under this disadvantage of looseness of\r\ndye, has entirely ceased, whilst others have been introduced which are\r\nquite as fast, and sometimes even faster than the natural dyes.\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to express the constituents of coal-tar, and the\r\ndistillates of those constituents, in the form of a genealogical chart,\r\nand thus, by way of conclusion, summarise the results which we have\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\n                             COAL.\r\n                               |\r\n   .----------+-----------+----+-------------------+--------+----.\r\n
