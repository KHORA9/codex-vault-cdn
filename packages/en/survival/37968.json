FULLER,\r\n\r\n_Author of the \"Grape Culturist,\" \"Small Fruit Culturist,\"\r\n\"Practical Forestry,\" \"Propagation of Plants,\" etc., etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n_ILLUSTRATED_\r\n\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK\r\n  ORANGE JUDD COMPANY\r\n  1896\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  COPYRIGHT, 1896,\r\n  BY ORANGE JUDD COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nBelieving that the time is opportune for making an effort to\r\ncultivate all kinds of edible and otherwise useful nut-bearing trees\r\nand shrubs adapted to the soil and climate of the United States,\r\nthereby inaugurating a great, permanent and far-reaching industry,\r\nthe following pages have been penned, and with the hope of\r\nencouraging and aiding the farmer to increase his income and\r\nenjoyments, without, to any appreciable extent, adding to his\r\nexpenses or labors. With this idea in mind, I have not advised the\r\ngeneral planting of nut orchards on land adapted to the production\r\nof grain and other indispensable farm crops, but mainly as roadside\r\ntrees and where desired for shade, shelter and ornament, being\r\nconfident that when all such positions are occupied with choice\r\nnut-bearing trees, to the exclusion of those yielding nothing of\r\nintrinsic value, there will have been added many millions of dollars\r\nto the wealth of the country, as well as a vast store of edible and\r\ndelicious food.\r\n\r\nThis work has not been written for the edification, or the special\r\napprobation, of scientific botanists, but for those who, in the\r\nopinion of the writer, are most likely to profit by a treatise of\r\nthis kind. Unfamiliar terms have been omitted wherever simple common\r\nwords would answer equally as well in conveying the intended\r\ninformation. There being no work of this kind published in this\r\ncountry that would serve as a guide, I have been compelled to\r\nformulate a plan of my own, and to describe all the newer varieties\r\nfrom the best specimens obtainable, and these may not, in all cases,\r\nhave been perfect. Under such circumstances, this work must\r\nnecessarily be incomplete, and especially where the possessors of\r\nclaimed-to-be new and valuable varieties have either refused or\r\nfailed to give any information in regard to them. On the contrary,\r\nhowever, I must acknowledge my indebtedness to many correspondents,\r\nwho have so generously placed specimens of both trees and nuts of\r\nrare new varieties in my hands for testing and describing, as well\r\nas assisting me in tracing their history and origin.\r\n\r\nThat this treatise may become the pioneer of many other and better\r\nworks on nut culture is the sincere wish of\r\n\r\n  THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n  RIDGEWOOD, N.

In this we are\r\npre-supposing that in the natural course of events, our population\r\nwill continue to increase in nearly the same ratio it has since we\r\nassumed the responsibilities of an independent nation.\r\n\r\nThe very existence of animal life on this planet depends upon the\r\nquantity and quality of available food, and while some\r\nsentimentalists may assume to ignore and even attempt to deprecate\r\nthe animal desires of their race, nature compels us to recognize the\r\nfact that there can be no fire without fuel, and the great and\r\nuseful intellectual powers of man are the emanations of the animal\r\ntissues of a well-nourished brain. The brawny arm that rends the\r\nrock and hurls the fragments aside, gets its power through the same\r\nchannel and from the same source as those of other members of\r\nsociety, whatever the nature of their calling; for mankind is built\r\nupon one universal and general plan, varied though it may be in some\r\nof the minor details of construction. We certainly have no cause to\r\nfear that the theories of Malthus, in regard to the overpopulation\r\nof the earth as a whole, will ever be verified in the experience of\r\nthe human race, because with necessity comes industry, also the\r\ninventions of devices to enable us to avoid just such dangers, and\r\nif these fail to keep pace with our wants and needs, wars,\r\nearthquakes, drouths, floods, and contagious, epidemic and other\r\ndiseases, become the weapons which nature employs to prevent\r\noverpopulation. But we cannot deny that nature does sometimes\r\nencourage or permit a somewhat redundant population in certain\r\nfavorable countries and localities, and then follows a struggle for\r\nexistence, and food becomes the paramount object in life. To ward\r\noff danger of this kind and keep the supply in excess of the demand,\r\nis a problem which should seriously engage the attention of every\r\none who takes the least interest in the general welfare of his\r\ncountrymen, even though the day of want or scarcity of food may be\r\nvery far distant.\r\n\r\nAmong the various sources of acceptable and nutritious food products\r\nheretofore almost entirely neglected in this country, the edible\r\nnuts stand preeminently and conspicuously in the foreground,\r\nawaiting the skill and attention of all who seek pleasure and\r\nprofit--to be derived from the products of the soil. For many\r\ncenturies these nuts have held a prominent position among the\r\ndesirable and valuable food products of various European and\r\nOriental countries; not only because they were important and almost\r\nindispensable in making up the household supplies of all classes of\r\nthe people, but often because available for filling a depleted\r\npurse, and the thing needful for this purpose has, in the main, been\r\nreceived from far-distant nations, who through indifference and\r\nneglect failed to provide themselves with such a simple and valuable\r\narticle as the edible nuts.\r\n\r\nMuch as we may boast of our immense natural resources and\r\nadvantages, we have not, as yet, availed ourselves of one-half of\r\nthose we possess, and the remainder is still awaiting our attention.\r\nWe also neglect to avail ourselves of the many superior domestic\r\ntraits and practices of the foreign nations with whom we are in\r\nconstant communication. It may be that the absence of incentives has\r\nmade us careless and indifferent in regard to a day of need, which\r\nin all probability will come to us sooner or later; but whatever the\r\ncause, the fact remains that we have been spending millions annually\r\non worthless articles and sentimental problems and projects, which\r\nhave brought us neither riches nor honor; in truth, to use a homely\r\nphrase, we have been following the bellwether in nearly all of our\r\nrural affairs and pursuits. As a natural result we are spending\r\nmillions for imported articles of everyday use which might easily\r\nand with large profit be produced at home, and in many instances the\r\nmost humiliating part of the transaction is that we send our money\r\nto people who do not purchase any of our productions and almost\r\nignore us in commercial matters. I am not referring to those\r\nproducts ill-adapted to our climate, nor to those which, owing to\r\nscarcity and high price of labor, we are unable to produce\r\nprofitably, but to such nuts as the almond, walnut and chestnut,\r\nwhich we can raise as readily as peaches, apples and pears. There\r\ncertainly can be no excuse for the neglect of such nut trees on the\r\nscore of cost of labor in propagation and planting, because our\r\nstreets and highways are lined and shaded with equally as expensive\r\nkinds, although they are absolutely worthless for any other purpose\r\nthan shade or shelter, yielding nothing in the way of food for\r\neither man or beast. Can any one invent a reasonable excuse for\r\nplanting miles and miles of roadside trees of such kinds as elm,\r\nmaple, ash, willow, cottonwood, and a hundred other similar kinds,\r\nwhere shellbark hickory, chestnut, walnut, pecan and butternut would\r\nthrive just as well, cost no more, and yet yield bushels of\r\ndelicious and highly prized nuts, and this annually or in alternate\r\nyears, continuing and increasing in productiveness for one, two or\r\nmore centuries. Aside from the intrinsic value of such trees, they\r\nare, in the way of ornament, just as beautiful as, and in many\r\ninstances much superior to those yielding nothing in the way of food\r\nexcept, perhaps, something for noxious insects.\r\n\r\nI am not attempting to pose as the one wise man engaged in rural\r\naffairs, but am merely recounting my personal observation and\r\nexperience, having in my younger days taken the advice of my elders,\r\nand at a time when a hint of the future value of nut trees would\r\nhave been worth more than a paid-up life insurance policy. But as\r\nthe hint was not given, I selected for roadside trees ash, maples,\r\ntulip, magnolias, and other popular kinds, all of which thrived, and\r\nby the time they were twenty years old began to be admired for their\r\nbeauty, although their roots were spreading into the adjoining\r\nfield, robbing the soil of the nutriment required for less\r\nvigorous-growing plants. Later, however, the discovery was made that\r\nI was paying very dearly for a crop of leaves and sentiment, neither\r\nof which was salable or available for filling one's purse. When\r\nthirty years of age the very best of my roadside trees were probably\r\nworth two dollars each for firewood, or one dollar more than the\r\nnurseryman's price at the time of planting. The greater part of\r\nthese trees, however, have since been cremated, a few being left as\r\nreminders of the misdirected labors of youth and inexperience.\r\n\r\nIn this matter of following a leader in tree-planting along the\r\nhighways, it appears to be a predominant trait of our rural\r\npopulation and as old as the settlement of this country, for nowhere\r\nis it more pronounced than in the New England States, where the\r\nAmerican elms attracted the attention of the Pilgrims and their\r\ncontemporaries and descendants, and even continued down to the\r\npresent day. No one will deny that the American elm is a noble tree\r\nin appearance, is easily transplanted and of rapid growth, and yet\r\nit is one of the most worthless for any economic purpose. It may be\r\nthat its worthlessness for other purposes made it all the more\r\nacceptable for streets and roadsides, the better kinds being\r\nreserved for firewood, fencing, furniture, and the manufacture of\r\nagricultural and other implements. But whatever the cause or object,\r\nthe elm became the one tree generally selected for planting in\r\nparks, villages, cities, and along roadsides in the country, not\r\nonly in the older but in many of the newer States. From present\r\nindications, however, the glory of this much over-praised tree is on\r\nthe wane, for the imported elm-leaf beetle (_Galeruca calmariensis_)\r\nis slowly but surely spreading over the country, defoliating the\r\nelms of all species and varieties, and it is a question whether we\r\nshould bless this insect for the work it is doing or look upon it as\r\na pest. Perhaps future generations will sing paeons in its praise,\r\nand they certainly will have reasons for rejoicing if better and\r\nmore useful kinds are planted in the places now occupied by the\r\nworthless elms.\r\n\r\nIn other localities some pioneer or leader in roadside ornamentation\r\nselected or recommended some species of maple, linden, catalpa,\r\npoplar or willow, but it made little or no difference as to kind,\r\nbecause, as a rule, all his neighbors followed without a thought or\r\nquestion in regard to adaptation to soil, climate, or fitness in the\r\nlocal or surrounding scenery, or of its future economic value. The\r\nresult of this want of taste and forethought may be seen in whatever\r\ndirection one travels throughout the older and more thickly settled\r\nportions of this country.\r\n\r\nHad the early settlers of the New England States planted shellbark\r\nhickories, or even the native chestnut, in place of the American\r\nelm, they would not only have had equally as beautiful trees for\r\nshade and ornament, but the nutritious nuts would scarcely have\r\nfailed to bring bright cheer to many a household and money to fill\r\noft-depleted purses, while their descendants would have blessed them\r\nfor their forethought. Of course there are other valuable kinds of\r\nnuts which thrive over the greater part of the New England States,\r\nbut I refer only to the two, which were so abundant in the forests\r\nthat one or both could have been obtained for the mere cost of\r\ntransplanting. But it is not fair to prate about the remissness and\r\nfollies of our ancestors, unless we can show by our works that\r\nwisdom has come down to us through their experience.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the New England is equally true of all the older\r\nStates, and is rapidly becoming so in many of the newer, little\r\nattention being paid to the intrinsic value of the wood or the\r\nproduct of the trees planted along the highways. There are also\r\nmillions of acres of wild lands not suitable for cultivation, but\r\nwell adapted to the growth of trees, whether of the nut-bearing or\r\nother kinds. But for the present I will omit further reference to\r\nthe planting of nut trees except on the line of the highways, just\r\nwhere other kinds have long been in vogue and are still being\r\ncultivated for shade and ornament,--with no thought, perhaps, on the\r\npart of the planter, that both could be obtained in the nut trees,\r\nwith something of more intrinsic value added. The nut trees which\r\ngrow to a large size are as well adapted for planting along\r\nroadsides, in the open country, as other kinds that yield nothing in\r\nthe way of food for either man or beast. They are also fully as\r\nbeautiful in form and foliage, and in many instances far superior,\r\nto the kinds often selected for such purposes.\r\n\r\nThe only objection I have heard of as being urged against planting\r\nfruit and nut trees along the highway is that they tempt boys and\r\ngirls--as well as persons of larger growth--to become trespassers;\r\nbut this only applies to where there is such a scarcity that the\r\nquantity taken perceptibly lessens the total crop. But where there\r\nis an abundance, either the temptation to trespass disappears, or we\r\nfail to recognize our loss. As we cannot very well dispense with the\r\nsmall boy and his sister, I am in favor of providing them\r\nbountifully with all the good things that climate and circumstance\r\nwill afford. It is a truism that conscience is never strengthened by\r\nan empty stomach.\r\n\r\nA mile, in this country, is 5280 feet, and if trees are set 40 feet\r\napart--which is allowing sufficient room for them to grow during an\r\nordinary lifetime--we get 133 per mile in a single row; but where\r\nthe roads are three to four rods wide, two rows may be planted, one\r\non each side, or 266 per mile. With such kinds as the Persian walnut\r\nand American and foreign chestnuts, we can safely estimate the crop,\r\nwhen the trees are twenty years old, at a half bushel per tree, or\r\n66 bushels for a single row, and 133 for a double row per mile. With\r\ngrafted trees of either kind we may count on double the quantity\r\nnamed, presuming, of course, that the trees are given proper care.\r\nBut to be on the safe side, let us keep our estimate down to the\r\nhalf-bushel mark per tree, and with this crop, at the moderate price\r\nof four dollars per bushel, we would get $264 from the crop on a\r\nsingle row, and double this sum, or $528, for the crop on a double\r\nrow--with a fair assurance that the yield would increase steadily\r\nfor the next hundred years or more; while the cost of gathering and\r\nmarketing the nuts is no greater, and in many instances much less\r\nthan that of the ordinary grain crops. At the expiration of the\r\nfirst half century, one-half of the trees may be removed, if they\r\nbegin to crowd, and the timber used for whatever purpose it may best\r\nbe adapted. The remaining trees would probably improve, on account\r\nof having more room for development.\r\n\r\nThere has been a steady increase in the demand, and a corresponding\r\nadvance in the price of all kinds of edible nuts, during the past\r\nthree or four decades, and this is likely to continue for many years\r\nto come, because consumers are increasing far more rapidly than\r\nproducers; besides, the forests, which have long been the only\r\nsource of supply of the native kinds, are rapidly disappearing,\r\nwhile there has not been, as yet, any special effort to make good\r\nthe loss, by replanting or otherwise. The dealers in such articles\r\nin our larger cities assure me that the demand for our best kinds of\r\nedible nuts is far in excess of the supply, and yet not one\r\nhousewife or cook in a thousand in this country has ever attempted\r\nto use nuts of any kind in the preparation of meats and other dishes\r\nfor the table, as is so generally practiced in European and Oriental\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe question may be asked, if the demand is sufficient to warrant\r\nthe planting of the hardy nut trees extensively along our highways\r\nor elsewhere. In answer to such a question it may be said that we\r\nnot only consume all of the edible nuts raised in this country, but\r\nimport millions of pounds annually of the very kinds which thrive\r\nhere as well as in any other part of the world.\r\n\r\nI have before me the records of our imports from the year 1790 to\r\n1894, but as I purpose dealing more with the present and future than\r\nwith the distant past, I will refer here only to the statistics of\r\nthe four years of the present decade, leaving out all reference to\r\nthe tropical nuts, which are not supposed to be adapted to our\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nOf almonds, not shelled, and on which there is a protective duty of\r\nthree cents per pound, we imported from 1890 to the close of 1893,\r\n12,443,895 pounds, valued at $1,100,477.65. Of almonds, shelled, on\r\nwhich the duty is now five cents, we imported 1,326,633 pounds. The\r\ntotal value of both kinds for the four years, amounted to\r\n$1,716,277.32. Whether this high protective duty is to remain or not\r\nis uncertain, but it is quite evident that it has had very little\r\neffect in stimulating the cultivation of this nut except in\r\ncircumscribed localities on the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nOf filberts and walnuts, not shelled, and with a duty of two cents\r\nper pound, we imported during the same years from eleven to fifteen\r\nmillion pounds annually, or a total for the four years of 54,526,181\r\npounds, and in addition about two million pounds of the shelled\r\nkernels, on which the duty was six cents (now four) per pound. The\r\ntotal value of these importations amounted to $3,176,085.34.\r\n\r\nI do not find the European chestnut mentioned in any list of\r\nimports, although an immense quantity must be received from France,\r\nItaly and Spain every year, and they are probably imported under the\r\nhead of miscellaneous nuts, not specially provided for, and upon\r\nwhich the duty was two cents per pound in 1890-'91, but was later\r\nreduced to one and a half cents.\r\n\r\nUnder the head \"miscellaneous nuts,\" or all other shelled and\r\nunshelled \"not specially provided for,\" there was imported during\r\nthe period named 6,442,908 pounds, valued at $235,976.05. The total\r\nfor all kinds of edible nuts imported was $7,124,575.82. These\r\nfigures are sufficient to prove that we are neglecting an\r\nopportunity to largely engage in and extend a most important and\r\nprofitable industry. It is true that in the Southern States\r\nconsiderable attention has been given, of late, to the preservation\r\nof the old pecan nut trees and the planting of young stock, but it\r\nwill be many years before the increase from this source can overtake\r\nthe ever-increasing demand for this delicious native nut.\r\nCalifornians are also making an effort to raise several foreign\r\nvarieties of edible nuts on a somewhat extensive scale, but all\r\nthese widely scattered experiments are mere drops in the ocean of\r\nour wants. Under such conditions I ask, in all seriousness, if it is\r\nnot about time that our farmers and rural population generally began\r\nto count their worthless and unproductive possessions, in the form\r\nof roadside and other shade trees--which have probably cost fully as\r\nmuch to secure, plant and care for during the few or many years\r\nsince they were set out, as would have been expended upon the most\r\nbeautiful and valuable nut-bearing kinds. If our ancestors were at\r\nfault in the selection of trees for planting, we need not expect\r\nthat posterity will excuse us for continuing and repeating their\r\nfolly, especially when our dear-bought experience should teach us\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nAt the present time there might be some difficulty in procuring, at\r\nthe nurseries, a choice selection of nut trees in any considerable\r\nquantity, suited to roadside planting, because heretofore there has\r\nbeen little demand for such stock; and nurserymen are only human,\r\nand conduct their establishments on business principles, propagating\r\nthe kind of trees in greatest demand, regardless of their intrinsic\r\nor future value to purchasers. They will also continue producing\r\nsuch stock just so long as the demand will warrant it, and further,\r\nit is but natural that they should sometimes recommend and advise\r\ntheir customers to purchase worthless, and even pestiferous kinds,\r\nsuch as the ailanthus and white poplar, because the profits in\r\nraising these trees are large and there is little danger of loss in\r\ntransplanting. But if purchasers will insist on having better kinds\r\nand refuse to accept any other, they will soon be accommodated; and\r\nif not, then let everyone who owns a plot of ground become his own\r\npropagator of trees. It is not beyond the ability of any moderately\r\nintelligent man (or woman, for that matter) to raise nut trees, and\r\nas readily as one could potatoes or corn.\r\n\r\nWhere farmers want a row of trees along the roadside, to be utilized\r\nfor line fence posts, they cannot possibly find any kinds better\r\nadapted for this purpose than chestnut, walnut and hickory; and\r\nthese will give just as dense a shade, and look as well--besides, in\r\na few years they may yield enough to pay the taxes on the entire\r\nfarm, the crop increasing in amount and value not only during the\r\nlifetime of the planter, but that of many generations of his\r\ndescendants.\r\n\r\nThis appeal to the good sense of our rural population is made in all\r\nsincerity and with the hope that it will be heeded by every man who\r\nhas a spark of patriotism in his soul, and who dares show it in his\r\nlabors, and by setting up a few milestones in the form of\r\nnut-bearing trees along the roadsides--if for no other purpose than\r\nthe present pleasure of anticipating the gratification such\r\nmonuments will afford the many who are certain to pass along these\r\nhighways years hence.\r\n\r\nIt is surely not good policy to enrich other nations at the expense\r\nof our own people, as we are now doing in sending millions of\r\ndollars annually to foreign countries in payment for such luxuries\r\nas edible nuts that could be readily and profitably produced at\r\nhome. There need be no fear of an overproduction of such things, no\r\nmatter how many may engage in their cultivation, because in such\r\nindustries many will resolve to do, and even make an attempt, but a\r\ncomparatively small number will reach any marked degree of success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE ALMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmygdalus, _Tournefort_. Name supposed to be derived from _amysso_,\r\nto lacerate, because of the prominent sharp, knifelike margin of one\r\nedge of the deeply pitted, wrinkled nut. Martius, an Italian\r\nbotanist, suggests that the name came from the Hebrew word _shakad_,\r\nsignifying vigilant, or to awake, because after the rigors of winter\r\nthe almond tree is one of the earliest to hail the coming of spring,\r\nwith its flowers. The common English name is from the Latin\r\n_amandola_, corrupted from _amygdala_. In French it is _amandier_;\r\nin German, _mandel_; Portuguese, _amendoa_; Spanish, _almendro_;\r\nItalian, _amandola_, _mandalo_, _mandorla_, etc.; Dutch, _amendel_;\r\nChinese, _him-ho-gin_.\r\n\r\nUnder the natural classification of plants the almond belongs to the\r\norder _Rosaceae_, and in the tribe _Drupaceae_. Linnaeus placed the\r\npeach and almond in the same genus, and they are now generally\r\nconsidered to be only varieties of one species,--the wild almond\r\ntree is probably the parent from which all the cultivated peaches\r\nand nectarines have descended. In most of our modern botanical works\r\nthese fruits are classed as a sub-section of _Prunus_, the plum.\r\nThey are mainly deciduous shrubs, or small trees. The flowers are\r\nvariable, both in size and color; but in the almond they are usually\r\nsomewhat larger than in the peach, almost sessile, and from separate\r\nscaly buds on the shoots of the preceding season, appearing in early\r\nspring, before or with the unfolding leaves, the latter being folded\r\nlengthwise in the bud. Leaves three to four inches long, tapering,\r\nfinely serrate, with few or no glands at the base of the blade, as\r\nseen in many varieties of the common peach. Fruit clothed with a\r\nfine dense pubescence in both peach and almond; but in the latter\r\nthe pulpy envelope becomes dry and fibrous at maturity, cracking\r\nopen irregularly, allowing the rough and deeply indented nuts to\r\ndrop out; while in the peach the pulpy part becomes soft, juicy and\r\nedible, the reverse of the almond. The nectarine is only a\r\nsmooth-skinned peach.\r\n\r\n=History of the Almond.=--As with most of our long-cultivated fruits\r\nand nut trees, very little is now known of the early history or\r\norigin of the almond, and even its native country has not been\r\npositively determined, although it is supposed to be indigenous to\r\nparts of Northern Africa and the mountainous region of Asia.\r\nTheophrastus, who wrote a history of plants about three centuries\r\nbefore the Christian era, mentions the almond as the only tree in\r\nGreece that produces blossoms before the leaves. From Greece it was\r\nintroduced into Italy, where the nuts were called _nuces graecae_, or\r\nGreek nuts.\r\n\r\nColumella, about the middle of the first century of our era, was the\r\nearliest Roman writer to mention the almond as distinct from the\r\npeach. From Italy this nut was slowly disseminated, making its way\r\nnorthward mainly through France, reaching Great Britain as late as\r\n1538 (_Hortus Kewensis_). But its cultivation has never extended in\r\nBritain, beyond sheltered gardens and orchard houses, owing to the\r\ncool and otherwise uncongenial climate, and the same is true of\r\nNorthern France and other regions to the eastward in Europe. But in\r\nthe south of France, also in Italy, Spain, Sicily, and throughout\r\nthe Mediterranean countries, both in Europe and Africa, the almond\r\nthrives, and has long been extensively cultivated. These nuts are an\r\nimportant article of commerce, immense quantities being exported by\r\nSpain, mainly from Valencia, while the so-called Jordan almond comes\r\nfrom Malaga, as very few are raised in the valley of the Jordan.\r\nBitter almonds come principally from Mogador in Morocco.\r\n\r\nAs for almond culture in the United States, very little is to be\r\nsaid further than that, while we have few experiments to refer to as\r\nhaving been made east of the Rocky Mountains, not one of our great\r\npomologists, in their published works, has ever given any reason for\r\nthe almost entire neglect of this nut. Mr. Wm. H. White, author of\r\n\"Gardening for the South\" (1868), throws no light upon the subject,\r\nmerely describing a few of the well-known varieties of the almond.\r\nDowning's \"Fruit and Fruit Trees of America,\" Thomas' \"American\r\nFruit Culturist,\" Barry's \"Fruit Garden,\" and a score of other\r\nstandard pomological works may be consulted, without obtaining\r\ntherefrom any information in regard to the culture of this nut\r\nfurther than to be assured that the hard-shelled varieties are hardy\r\nin the North wherever the peach tree thrives, and the thin, or paper\r\nshelled, succeed only in warm climates. All these authors agree in\r\nsaying that the propagation and cultivation of the almond is the\r\nsame as practiced with the peach.\r\n\r\nComing down to recent years for information in regard to almond\r\nculture, we find H. E. Van Deman, pomologist to the Department of\r\nAgriculture, dismissing the subject in his report for 1892, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    \"I only mention this nut to state to all experimenters that it\r\n    is useless to try to grow the almond of commerce this side of\r\n    the Rocky mountains, except, possibly, in New Mexico and\r\n    southwestern Texas. This is thoroughly established by many\r\n    reports from those who have tried it in nearly every State and\r\n    for many years past. It is too tender in the North and does not\r\n    bear in the South. In California it is an eminent success.\r\n\r\n    \"The flavor of the hard-shelled almond, so far as I have tested\r\n    it, is little or no better than a peach kernel, and is therefore\r\n    practically worthless. The tree of this variety is about as\r\n    hardy as the peach, and bears quite freely. The attention paid\r\n    to the almond in the Atlantic and Central States might well be\r\n    given to other nuts.\"\r\n\r\nThis is certainly a very easy way of disposing of the cultivation of\r\na nut which has so long figured among our importations from European\r\ncountries; besides, no experiments are cited, experimenters named,\r\nor reasons given why almond culture is a failure in the Southern\r\nStates. But fortunately there are men in the South who are able and\r\nready to give reasons for their opinions and statements, in regard\r\nto the cultivation of crops or plants with which they have become\r\nfamiliar through personal experience. When I asked Mr. P. J.\r\nBerckmans, Augusta, Ga., president of the American Pomological\r\nSociety, for information on this point, he promptly replied as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    \"The reason that almonds are not cultivated in Georgia and other\r\n    Southern States is because of their early blooming, as spring\r\n    frosts usually destroy all the blossoms. We have tried many\r\n    varieties of the soft-shell without success. The hard-shell will\r\n    occasionally bear a crop of fruit, as it blooms later, and the\r\n    blooms seem to resist cold better than the other varieties. In\r\n    middle Florida soft-shell almonds are sometimes successful, but\r\n    they have been tried so sparingly that I cannot obtain any\r\n    satisfactory reports.\"\r\n\r\nAdmitting, as we do, that President Berckmans' long experience in\r\nthe cultivation of nut and fruit trees in the South enables him to\r\nspeak with authority on this subject, still, we have some\r\nencouragement for continuing experiments with the almond in regions\r\nknown to be favorable for the cultivation of its near relative, the\r\npeach. Furthermore, experiments seem to be wanting with the almond\r\nin the more elevated regions of the northern line of Southern\r\nStates, also in Maryland, Delaware and southern New Jersey, near the\r\nseacoast, or other large bodies of water, which, as is well known,\r\nhave considerable influence in retarding the early blooming of fruit\r\ntrees, as well as warding off late spring and early autumn frosts.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely reasonable to suppose that a region of country as\r\nextensive as that of one-half of the Middle and all of the Southern\r\nStates, with a range of climate admitting of the successful\r\ncultivation of such hardy fruits as the apple and pear, and from\r\nthese down to the pineapple and cocoa-nut, should not yield a\r\nlocality or localities admirably adapted to the cultivation of the\r\nhalf-hardy almond tree. It is no doubt true that there are extensive\r\nregions in the South where late spring frosts are exceedingly\r\ntroublesome, and sometimes disastrously so, to fruit growers; but\r\neven these have their limits, as shown in the vast quantity and\r\nvariety of fruits annually produced in the Southern States. But\r\ngreat local variations in climate are natural to all countries in\r\nthe temperate zone, and we frequently find the most favorable and\r\nthe unfavorable for fruit culture within a few miles of each other.\r\n\r\nIf there are not thousands and tens of thousands of acres of land\r\nlocated in favorable positions between Virginia and Florida, adapted\r\nto produce the commercial almond in some of its varieties, then we\r\nmust confess that the study of climatology is of little use to the\r\npomologist. Furthermore, all the varieties of the so-called\r\nhard-shelled almonds which thrive in our northern States are not\r\nworthless, neither are the kernels of all of them \"bitter,\" and even\r\nif they were, they would still be worth cultivating, else we would\r\nnot import such vast quantities from Morocco to supply the demand.\r\n\r\nIf none of the thin-shelled varieties heretofore tried in the South\r\nare successful, it is time that either our experiment stations or\r\nindividual horticulturists made some attempt to produce those that\r\nare adapted to that region of country. But until we have some more\r\ndefinite information than heretofore disseminated, in regard to\r\nalmond culture in the South, it is safe to conclude that failures in\r\nthe past have been due mainly to want of judgment, or knowledge of\r\nvarieties and of positions for the orchard, with, perhaps, some\r\nneglect in care and cultivation.\r\n\r\nIn California almond culture has been pushed with vigor for several\r\ndecades, but at first with rather indifferent results, because\r\ngrowers depended upon noted European varieties, which, as experience\r\nproved, were not adapted to the soil and climate of the country. In\r\na paper read before the American Pomological Society at its session\r\nheld at Sacramento, Cal., Jan. 16-18, 1895, Prof. E. J. Wickson, of\r\nthe University of California, alluded to this subject of almond\r\nculture in the State as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"In no branch of this effort for improved varieties has our\r\n    success been more marked than in the development of seedling\r\n    almonds. The achievements of A. T. Hatch in this line are too\r\n    well known to require but a passing allusion. It is not too much\r\n    to say that this work rescued almond culture to California. When\r\n    he began, the almond, because of almost universal failure of the\r\n    old varieties, was a jest and a byword in our horticulture.\r\n    Nine-tenths of all the almonds planted during the preceding\r\n    twenty-five years had gone for firewood or were carrying the\r\n    foliage of the prune to conceal their hated stems. At the\r\n    present time, through the dissemination of Mr. Hatch's\r\n    varieties, the almond, in all regions decently adapted to the\r\n    tree, is productive and profitable and has a future.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. A CALIFORNIA ALMOND ORCHARD.]\r\n\r\nThat almond culture in California is rapidly becoming an important\r\nand successful industry, we have an ocular demonstration in the tons\r\nof these valuable nuts received from there in the past few years,\r\nand placed on sale in Eastern markets. If one man, by his individual\r\nefforts, can revolutionize or establish a great industry in a region\r\nas large as the State of California, it is not too much to expect\r\nthat something of the kind could be done elsewhere, with the\r\ncombined efforts of several men. If the varieties heretofore tried\r\nin the East are unsuited to the climate, it is certainly within the\r\nrange of probabilities that others better adapted to surrounding\r\nconditions can be produced. The native grape, raspberry and\r\nstrawberry have had a history similar to the almond, but now all are\r\nextensively and successfully cultivated.\r\n\r\n=Propagation of the Almond.=--The propagation of the almond is\r\nidentical with that of the peach: that is, from seed to procure new\r\nvarieties, or by budding the more desirable ones, when obtained,\r\nupon seedling almond, peach or plum stocks. The half-wild\r\nhard-shelled almond is probably the most congenial and best stock\r\nfor this purpose, but seedlings of the peach are most generally\r\nemployed because the most abundant and cheapest. Under certain\r\nconditions, such as cold, heavy, moist soils, and where rather\r\ndwarfish trees are desired, the plum may be employed with advantage\r\nas a stock, but it is not to be recommended for general orchard\r\nculture. In mild climates seedlings of the best of the soft-shelled\r\nvarieties may be raised and planted in orchards without budding, but\r\nthe nuts from such trees are likely to be somewhat variable in size\r\nand quality, although the trees will usually prove to be as healthy\r\nand productive as those subjected to artificial modes of\r\npropagation. If, however, the grower desires a uniform product, he\r\nmust resort to the usual means of obtaining it; that is, multiplying\r\nsuperior or distinct varieties by budding, either upon peach, almond\r\nor other stocks. It is advisable, as well as exceedingly important,\r\nfor all who intend or feel inclined to cultivate almonds in regions\r\nwhere the adaptation of this nut has not been fully established by\r\nyears of practical experience, that seedlings should be raised in\r\nlarge numbers, and from these a selection be made to meet the\r\nrequirements of the climate and other conditions under which they\r\nare to be propagated and grown. If spring frosts have been\r\nheretofore inimical to the cultivation of the almond, then the\r\nproduction of late-blooming varieties would be a remedy. There will\r\nalso be variations in the season of ripening; some may come on too\r\nearly, others far too late for special localities, but all these\r\nfaults or variations may be readily overcome by raising seedlings,\r\nand then selecting for propagation those coming nearest fulfilling\r\nthe requirements of local conditions or circumstances. It is by such\r\nexperiments and means that fruit culture has reached its present\r\nposition in this and all other countries, where it is practiced as\r\nan art or industrial pursuit. Varieties that have become exceedingly\r\npopular and profitable in one locality or country, may not have\r\nsucceeded elsewhere, and this holds good with all cultivated plants.\r\n\r\nIn making experiments with the almond in regions where it has not\r\nbeen cultivated, but under conditions which appear to be favorable,\r\nI would certainly advise testing the well-known varieties first, and\r\nif these fail, then see what can be done in the way of producing new\r\nones adapted to the locality and climate.\r\n\r\n=Raising Seedlings for Stocks.=--In warm or moderately mild climates\r\nthe nuts, whether peach or almond, may be planted soon after they\r\nare gathered in the fall, but should the weather continue warm and\r\nmoist the nuts will sometimes sprout prematurely and the young\r\nsprouts get frosted later in the season, and for this reason it is\r\nbetter to store them in a cool room, packed in dry sand or soil,\r\nuntil the approach of steady cold weather, and then plant. Having\r\nlost choice kinds of nuts from being in too great haste in getting\r\nthem into the ground in the fall, I am prompted to give this warning\r\nto those who have had no experience in raising nut trees. If not\r\nconvenient to plant in the fall, nuts of all kinds may be packed in\r\nbarrels, boxes, or similar vessels, mixed with or stratified with\r\nsharp sand or light soil, then stored in a dry, cool place,--a very\r\ncool cellar will answer, but in my experience, out of doors is\r\npreferable,--and in the shade of some evergreen tree or on the north\r\nside of a building, and there banked over with earth just sufficient\r\nto keep the nuts at an equably low temperature. It is advisable to\r\nhave a few small holes in the bottom of the barrels or boxes, to\r\ninsure proper drainage, should any considerable amount of water get\r\nin at the top; but this will not occur if the vessels are properly\r\ncovered with boards when placed in position for winter.\r\n\r\nIt must also be kept in mind that mice, squirrels and chipmunks are\r\nfond of almonds and other kinds of edible nuts, and if placed where\r\nthese little rodents can find them, they are sure to take a share,\r\nor perhaps the entire store, before their visits are discovered. I\r\nhave known field mice to dig down under boxes of nuts, enlarge the\r\nholes left for drainage, and spend the winter among the chestnuts\r\nwhich I had put away for planting in spring. The safest way is to\r\nplace fine wire netting on the bottom of the box, and then cover it\r\nwith the same. Owing to the abundance of mice and other little\r\nnut-eating animals, I have never dared to plant out nuts in the\r\nfall, and so have always stored them in sand, but out of doors\r\nduring the winter, and well covered with earth. In other localities\r\nit may be safe to sow in autumn, and if protection from vermin is\r\nrequired, coat the nuts with gas tar, the same as practiced by\r\nfarmers in protecting seed corn against the attacks of crows and\r\nother corn-pulling birds. One pint of warm tar will be sufficient\r\nfor a bushel of nuts, and the application is readily made by placing\r\nthe nuts in a barrel, pouring the tar on them, and stirring with a\r\nstick until every nut is coated. To prevent the tar sticking to the\r\nhands in planting, dust the nuts with dry wood ashes, land plaster,\r\nor fine dry sand.\r\n\r\nIf peach stones are to be planted for stocks they may be put into\r\nthe ground as soon as ready in autumn, because they are rarely\r\ndisturbed by vermin; or if more convenient, mix with common soil,\r\nand in heaps, in the open ground, and leave in this position until\r\nspring, then pick out as they begin to sprout, and plant. The\r\nhard-shelled almond may be treated in the same way, only they are\r\nnot to be handled quite as roughly as peach stones, and for\r\nprotection it is best to put them in barrels or boxes, as described\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nWhen ready for planting take out the nuts and drop them in shallow\r\ndrills, one every ten or twelve inches, then cover with about two\r\ninches of soil. It is to be supposed, of course, that a seed bed has\r\nbeen prepared, by thorough working over and enriching, if necessary,\r\nin advance of planting. The distance between the drills or rows\r\nshould be sufficient to admit of cultivating the plants with a horse\r\nor mule, and cultivator, during the summer, and if this is done and\r\nthe soil stirred often enough to keep down all weeds, the stocks\r\nshould become large enough to admit of budding the first season; if\r\nnot, then this operation must be deferred until the following year.\r\nBut in case the seedlings are raised from choice varieties and to be\r\nleft in their natural condition for fruiting, they may be lifted\r\nwhen one or two seasons old and set where they are to remain\r\npermanently.\r\n\r\n=The Season for Budding.=--So much depends upon climate, location,\r\nand variation of seasons, that no special date or time can be given\r\nfor budding trees of any kind, but it is always to be done while the\r\nstocks are in active growth, because the bark must part freely from\r\nthe wood underneath, in order to admit of inserting the bud under\r\nit. If the buds are set too early in the season there is danger of a\r\npremature growth; that is, of pushing out a shoot in the fall\r\ninstead of remaining dormant until the following spring. Under\r\ncertain conditions, however, and for special purposes, it may be\r\nadvisable to force the buds as soon as they have formed a union with\r\nthe stock, but as a rule, in the propagation of hardy and half-hardy\r\ntrees, it is better to keep the buds dormant during the cool or cold\r\nwinter months.\r\n\r\nHere in the Northern States we usually begin to look over our stocks\r\nduring the latter part of July or first week in August, and note\r\ntheir progress and condition. Should they show the least signs of\r\ncessation of growth, we begin budding them, and push the work as\r\nrapidly as possible. If the season is a wet one the stocks may\r\ncontinue to grow and remain in good condition for budding until the\r\nmiddle of September; but in a dry season they may cease to grow in\r\nAugust, and it is these variable conditions which gives to the close\r\nobserver and man of experience such an advantage over the novice in\r\nthe propagation of plants. It is better to begin budding too early\r\nthan to be a few days too late.\r\n\r\nThe operation called budding consists in taking a bud, with a small\r\nportion of the bark adjoining, from one plant, and inserting it in\r\nanother, or in some other part of the same plant from which it was\r\ntaken. The physiological principles which govern the operation are,\r\nthat there must exist an affinity between the plant from which the\r\nbud is taken and the one upon which it is to be placed, and the\r\nnearer the relationship the more readily will it unite and the more\r\nperfect the union. For instance, the cultivated peach and almond are\r\nsupposed to be of the same origin, and descendants of one original\r\nspecies; consequently there is a close relationship between the\r\nvarieties of both sections, and their seedlings may be employed\r\nindiscriminately for stocks. The next nearest relatives in the\r\nfamily line are the plums (_Prunus_), some of which answer very well\r\nas stocks for the almond, although very rarely used for this\r\npurpose. The next group in the line of botanical relationship are\r\nthe cherries (_Prunus cerasus_), but these are too far removed to be\r\nemployed as stocks for either the peach or almond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. BUDDING KNIFE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. YANKEE BUDDING KNIFE.]\r\n\r\nFor budding are necessary a small knife for preparing the buds for\r\ninsertion and making an incision in the bark of the stock to admit\r\nthem; and a quantity of some material to tie around the stock, so as\r\nto hold the bud in place. Budding knives are made after various\r\npatterns; one that is commonly used has an ivory or bone handle,\r\nmade very thin at the end, that is used to peel the bark from the\r\nstock where the bud is to be inserted (Fig. 2). Another form of\r\nbudding knife is made with a horn handle, and a small tapering piece\r\nof ivory fastened in the end. These knives, of various shapes and\r\nsizes, can be had at the seed stores; but another and quite a\r\ndifferent form of budding knife is shown in Fig. 3, and is known as\r\nthe \"Yankee budding knife.\" It is merely a small one-bladed pocket\r\nknife with a thin blade, round at the end. The cutting portion\r\nextends about one-third around the end of the blade and two-thirds\r\nof its length, leaving the lower part dull. Although this form of\r\nbudding knife has been in constant use in some of the older\r\nnurseries in this country for nearly a century, it does not appear\r\nto have been manufactured for the general trade, but only on special\r\norders for nurserymen. It is so simple a knife, however, that with a\r\nlittle grinding almost any small one-bladed pocket knife can be\r\ntransformed into one of these handy budding knives. The rounded end\r\nof the blade is used for lifting the bark, and for rapid work it is\r\nfar more convenient than any form of knife that must be reversed in\r\nthe hand every time a bud is inserted. In addition, a polished bit\r\nof steel is smoother and far less likely to lacerate the alburnous\r\nmatter between the bark and wood than the best piece of bone or\r\nivory. It may be said, however, that it is immaterial what form of\r\nknife is employed, provided it has a keen edge and is dexterously\r\nused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. PREPARED SHOOT.]\r\n\r\nThe material most commonly used in times past for tying in the bud\r\nis the inner bark of the linden or basswood tree, usually called\r\nbass, and always to be procured in the form of mats, or as prepared\r\nfrom our indigenous basswoods and kept on sale at the seed stores.\r\nRecently, however, another excellent tying material has come into\r\nuse, known in the trade as raffia or roffia. It is the cuticle of\r\nthe Jupati palms. One species (_Raphia taedigera_) is a native of the\r\nlower valley of the Amazon and Orinoco, and another (_R. Ruffia_) of\r\nMadagascar and adjacent islands. Raffia is somewhat softer and more\r\npliable than the ordinary bass, although it does not hold its form\r\nquite as well; but it is so cheap, soft and strong, that it has\r\nbecome very popular, and is extensively used for budding and many\r\nother purposes. But if none of these tying materials are at hand,\r\nthe inner bark of the persimmon, corn husks, cotton twine, woolen\r\nyarn, or even strips of old muslin and calico may be employed with\r\nequally as good results, although not as handy and convenient for\r\nsuch purposes. The amateur, with only a few stocks to bud, can\r\nreadily improvise implements and materials for doing the work, even\r\nif they are not of the regulation type. In selecting buds, the young\r\nshoots of the present season's growth are preferred, and these\r\nshould be taken from the most healthy and vigorous branches of\r\nbearing trees, if possible. The leaves should be immediately\r\nremoved, not by breaking or pulling off with the hand, but by\r\nsevering the leaf-stalks with a knife, as shown in Fig. 4. If the\r\nleaves have fallen from the twig, the buds may be too ripe, with\r\nsome kinds of plants, but with the almond, and where only a few\r\nleaves near the base have dropped, all may be used with fair\r\nsuccess. If there are any soft and immature buds on the upper part\r\nof the shoot, or any undeveloped ones at the base, they should be\r\nrejected. Success in budding depends very largely upon the condition\r\nof the stocks at the time the operation is performed. Unless the sap\r\nis flowing and in sufficient abundance to allow the bark to part or\r\npeel readily from the wood underneath, the bud is certain to fail.\r\nIf the buds used should happen to be a little over-ripe or wholly\r\ndormant when placed in direct contact with the living tissues and\r\nthe juices of the stock, they will absorb moisture and nutriment,\r\nand be as likely to unite and live as under opposite conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. INCISION FOR BUD.]\r\n\r\nIn performing the operation of budding, the following rules may be\r\nobserved: Take the twig from which the buds are to be removed, in\r\nthe left hand, with the small end pointing under the left arm;\r\ninsert the knife-blade half an inch, or a little more, below the\r\nbud, cutting through the bark and a little into the wood; pass the\r\nknife under the bud, and bring it out about the same distance above\r\nit, taking off the bud with the bark, and a thin slice of wood\r\nattached, as at _c_, Fig. 4. Then, if using the Yankee budding\r\nknife, or one of similar form, let the forefinger clasp the lower\r\npart of the blade, make the horizontal incision in the stock first,\r\nand from this an incision downward about an inch long,--or it may be\r\ntwice this length without doing any harm,--being careful not to cut\r\ntoo deep. Lift up the edge of the bark by passing the back of the\r\nend of the blade (without removing it) up to the horizontal\r\nincision. Lift the bark on the other side in the same manner, the\r\ntwo incisions making a wound in the stock resembling the letter T,\r\nas shown in Fig. 5. If other forms of budding knives are used, the\r\nthin end of the ivory handle is thrust under the bark, raising it\r\nsufficiently to admit the bud. The budder holds the bud between the\r\nthumb and forefinger of his left hand while making the incision in\r\nthe stock; and as the knife leaves it he places the lower point of\r\nthe bark attached to the bud under the bark of the stock before this\r\nfalls back into place, and thrusts it down into position. If the\r\nupper end of the bark attached to the bud does not pass completely\r\nunder the bark of the stock, it must be cut across, so as to allow\r\nthat which remains with the bud to fall into place and rest firmly\r\non the wood of the stock, as shown in Fig. 6.\r\n\r\nWhen the bud is in position and fitted to the stock, as shown, wind\r\nthe raffia, or other material used, around the stock, both above and\r\nbelow, covering the entire incision, leaving only the bud and part\r\nof leafstalk uncovered. Of course experienced propagators have their\r\nown individual systems and modes of operation, but the above may be\r\ntaken as a safe guide for the amateur budder. The ligatures should\r\nbe loosened or removed as soon as the bud has become firmly united\r\nwith the stock, which will usually be in ten or fifteen days, if at\r\nall. When the buds have failed, others may be inserted, provided, of\r\ncourse, the stocks are in condition to admit of the operation.\r\nExceptions, however, may be made where the budding has been done so\r\nlate in the season that the stock has ceased to grow by the time the\r\nbuds have taken, and in such cases the ligatures may be left on\r\nlater and removed any time before winter. In cold climates the snow,\r\nice and water are likely to get in around the bud if the ligatures\r\nare not removed. But where the stocks are vigorous and the buds set\r\nearly, there will be danger of the ligatures cutting into the bark\r\nas the stocks swell or increase in diameter, unless they are\r\nloosened or entirely removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. BUD IN POSITION.]\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances budded stocks should not be headed back\r\nuntil the following spring, and then should be cut off two or three\r\ninches above the inserted bud; and when this pushes into growth, all\r\nsuckers and sprouts below and above it should be rubbed off as they\r\nappear, for the object is to throw the entire strength of the stock\r\ninto this one bud, and when this has made a growth of two or three\r\nfeet the short stump of the stock above the base of the shoot may be\r\ncarefully removed with a sharp knife. This is usually done the last\r\nof July or first of August, which gives time for the healing of the\r\nwound before the close of the growing season. Sometimes it may be\r\nnecessary to place small stakes by the side of these shoots for\r\ntheir support and to prevent breaking at the point of union with the\r\nstock; but this will rarely be necessary, except in very exposed\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\nIf the young trees make a fairly good growth they will be ready for\r\nplanting out in the orchard the following spring, and one-year-old\r\nalmond trees are usually preferable for transplanting than older. It\r\nis not advisable to prune these young trees during the growing\r\nseason the first summer, but allow all the side shoots or branches\r\nto grow unchecked, for by so doing we secure a more stocky plant, if\r\nnot as tall a one, than we would if trimming up was practiced. But\r\nwhen the trees are taken up for transplanting, in the late fall or\r\nearly spring, then they may be pruned and the lateral branches cut\r\noff close to the main stem, leaving a naked rod, and if low-headed\r\ntrees are desired (and they usually are), cut back the main stem to\r\nabout three feet from the ground. If the young trees have made a\r\ngrowth of from four to six feet, then prune away the lateral\r\nbranches to a hight of three feet or a little more, and cut in all\r\nbranches above this point to within four to six inches of the main\r\nstem, leaving the buds on these stumps to form the head of the tree.\r\nFour or five branches at the top of the stem will be sufficient for\r\nthe foundation for an open, round-headed tree, or in what may be\r\ntermed a vase form, which is the best for almonds.\r\n\r\n=Soil and Exposure for Almonds.=--The almond requires a warm, rather\r\nlight and well-drained soil. Cold, heavy clays, and low, moist\r\nsoils, whether light or heavy, are always to be avoided for the\r\nalmond and closely allied trees. That the soil should be moderately\r\nrich is, of course, a condition required with all cultivated nut and\r\nfruit trees, but over-stimulation may result in excessive and\r\nimmature growth late in the season, this leaving the twigs in such a\r\nstate that they will be unable to resist even a few degrees of\r\nfrost, to which they may be subjected the ensuing winter. In what\r\nare generally termed mild climates, or where the temperature seldom\r\ngoes more than four to six degrees below the freezing point, hardy\r\ntrees, if they have made a late growth, are often injured more than\r\nthey would have been in a colder climate, with early matured wood.\r\nThere are many kinds of what we consider very hardy trees and shrubs\r\nhere in the North, that are very likely to be winterkilled or\r\nseverely frosted when grown at the South, simply because the\r\nconditions are such that they do not ripen up in time to resist the\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nIn touching upon the subject of location for an almond orchard east\r\nof the Mississippi, I should be inclined to relegate this valuable\r\nnut to semi-tropical Florida, were it not for the fact that almost a\r\nscore of ornamental species and varieties of the same genus,--to say\r\nnothing of the widely cultivated peach,--flourish over a very wide\r\nrange of country and climate, and nowhere better than near the\r\nAtlantic ocean in the Middle and some of the Northern States. It is\r\nalso generally conceded that several of what are called hard-shelled\r\nvarieties thrive and bear fruit in nearly all of our best\r\npeach-growing regions. From all that I have been able to learn of\r\nalmond culture, and with my own limited experience with this nut,\r\nexperiments are wanting to prove that it cannot be successfully\r\ncultivated in the peach-growing region of the Eastern States. I will\r\nnot say \"profitably\" cultivated, for this is a rather vague term\r\nwhen applied to horticultural operations of any kind. Success is not\r\nsynonymous with profit; in fact, it is frequently quite the\r\nopposite, and an abundant crop may mean glutted markets and a\r\ncorresponding loss to the producer. But, to return to location, the\r\nprincipal cause of failure in almond culture, where it has been\r\ntried in the older States, seems to be the early blooming of the\r\ntrees and subsequent destruction of the embryo fruit by frosts. To\r\navoid this, high, open, airy situations, and even the north side of\r\nhills, would certainly be preferable to southern slopes and\r\nprotected locations, especially in the South or where the\r\ntemperature in winter does not go low enough to kill the wood of the\r\nprevious season's growth. Theoretically, we might suppose that there\r\nare many locations favorable to almond culture in the elevated\r\nregions of North Carolina and Tennessee, as well as in the northern\r\ntier of counties in Alabama and Georgia. But in the absence of\r\ncarefully conducted experiments in these regions, we have only to\r\nwait for their consummation at some future time, to prove the truth\r\nor falsity of our theory.\r\n\r\nIn the rich, warm valleys of New Mexico, Arizona and California,\r\ncongenial locations are plentiful, inasmuch as almost every variety\r\nof climate is at hand, with a temperature ranging from that of\r\nperpetual summer to the opposite extreme, and all to be found within\r\na few miles, and frequently to be found in the same county. Under\r\nsuch conditions, it rests with the would-be cultivator to decide\r\nupon the kinds of fruits desired, then to seek a location best\r\nadapted to his purpose.\r\n\r\nIf, as claimed,--but not proven,--there are no limited or extended\r\nareas fitted for almond culture east of the Mississippi river, there\r\nare certainly plenty of such west of it, awaiting the industrious\r\nand intelligent nut culturist. Almond orchards have been planted in\r\nCalifornia and Arizona, and the quality of the nuts, as well as the\r\nquantity, is very satisfactory; but a greater number and more\r\nextensive orchards are needed to meet the home demand.\r\n\r\n=Planting and Pruning.=--In planting and pruning the almond tree the\r\nsame system should be adopted as with its near relative, the peach.\r\nOne-year-old budded trees are preferred for planting in an orchard,\r\nto older, except in the case of seedlings, then two-year-old may be\r\nselected, because these are seldom larger than one-year budded\r\ntrees. The trees should be set fifteen to eighteen feet apart,\r\nvarying the distance according to variety, soil, and other local\r\nconditions, and it is best to place them in rows and at right\r\nangles, in order to admit of cultivating both ways, as it is termed,\r\nthereby saving as much hand labor as possible. For the first two or\r\nthree years after planting, all weeds and grass should be kept away\r\nfrom the stems and over the roots, either by frequent hoeing, or\r\ncovering with a mulch. The best way, perhaps, to prevent the growth\r\nof weeds, is to use the land among the trees for some low-growing\r\ncrops, such as beans, tomatoes, melons or potatoes, then see that\r\nthe workmen, when hoeing these crops, hoe up the weeds and grass\r\nabout the trees at the same time. We might reasonably suppose that\r\nthe most careless cultivator of trees would think of this, but,\r\nunfortunately, extended observation proves quite the contrary, and\r\nit is scarcely possible to go through any very extensive\r\nfruit-growing region without seeing many such instances of neglect.\r\nA square yard or more of tough sward is frequently left for years\r\nundisturbed about the stems of all the trees in an orchard, while\r\nthe little annual plants growing near by, and not worth, at an\r\nextreme valuation, five cents each, are cultivated with the greatest\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nThe first pruning of the trees should be done at the time of\r\ntransplanting from the nursery rows, as directed on a preceding\r\npage, and from the top of the stem only three or four shoots allowed\r\nto grow the first season, all others being rubbed off as soon as\r\nthey appear, or when they have made a growth of two or three inches.\r\nThese three or four upper branches are to become the foundation of\r\nthe future head of the tree, and should be allowed to grow unchecked\r\nthe first season; the next spring cut back one-half to two-thirds of\r\ntheir original length. This pruning will force out strong side or\r\nlateral shoots near the base, thus giving a sturdy foundation to\r\nbuild upon later, the pruner keeping in mind that the weaker the\r\ngrowth the more severe should be the pruning. Better leave a few\r\nstrong buds, from which vigorous shoots will be produced, than a\r\ngreat number succeeded by many feeble twigs. If blossoms and fruit\r\nappear on the young two-year-old trees, a limited number may be left\r\nto mature, although no considerable crop ought to be gathered before\r\nthe third year.\r\n\r\nIn after years a somewhat different system of pruning may be\r\nadopted, keeping in view the fact that the fruit buds and fruit are\r\nalways produced on the young shoots of the previous season's growth,\r\nand for this reason an annual renewal of such parts of the tree is\r\nabsolutely required, in order to secure a good crop on trees of any\r\nage. In some localities and countries it may be possible that almond\r\ntrees produce a crop every year; but this is scarcely to be expected\r\nanywhere. Consequently a system of pruning should be followed which\r\nwill conform to the variations of circumstances and conditions; and\r\nthis brings us to the consideration of--\r\n\r\n=The Proper Time to Prune.=--If the growth of the trees and their\r\nfruiting were always uniform, then we might readily adopt some\r\ninvariable system and season for pruning; but as we are dealing with\r\nuncertainties, our rules must be equally flexible and variable. If\r\nthe season is favorable, and the trees bloom freely and fruit sets\r\nabundantly, we may proceed to prune as soon as the embryo nuts are\r\nas large as peas,--but only cutting back some of the largest bearing\r\nshoots, and thinning out others here and there, just enough to\r\nequalize and evenly distribute the crop through the head of the\r\ntree. But in case the frost or cold of winter has destroyed the crop\r\nfor the season, then as soon as this is discovered, prune and cut\r\nback all the shoots and branches sufficient to insure a vigorous\r\ngrowth of young bearing wood for the ensuing year. Under this system\r\nof pruning we fix the time as after blooming in the spring, in order\r\nto have our work correspond to circumstances and conditions, and\r\nwhere there is a crop in prospect the pruning is comparatively\r\nlight; but if there is to be no fruit, or but little, then one\r\nshould aim to produce an abundance of bearing shoots for the\r\nfollowing season. In other words, we prune severely in non-bearing\r\nyears, whether they occur alternately or otherwise; but this system\r\nis only applicable to trees like the almond and peach, which produce\r\ntheir fruit on the shoots of the preceding year's growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES OF THE ALMOND.\r\n\r\nAlmonds are usually divided into three groups, viz.: Bitter,\r\nhard-shelled, and soft, or paper-shelled. In each there are many\r\nvarieties, although they are rarely known in market except by the\r\ngeneral name of the group to which they belong. If they are soft,\r\nhard or bitter, this is sufficient designation for commercial\r\npurposes, with, perhaps, the addition of the name of country in\r\nwhich they were grown, or that of the city or seaport from whence\r\nexported.\r\n\r\n=Bitter Almond=, _Amygdalus communis amara_.--The varieties of this\r\ngroup are not specifically distinct, and some have soft, thin\r\nshells, while others are thick and hard; but the kernels are very\r\nbitter, hence the name. But in the countries where these almonds are\r\nmost extensively cultivated, as in the South of France, Austria,\r\nSpain and Greece, the trees are generally raised from the nut, and,\r\nas might be expected, the crop produced under such conditions is\r\nexceedingly variable, the nuts being large or small, and the shells\r\nof various degrees of hardness, with an occasional tree producing\r\nboth bitter and sweet kerneled nuts. These wilding trees are, in the\r\nmain, more hardy than the improved varieties, hence are largely\r\nemployed as stocks for the better sorts, as well as for the plum and\r\napricot. It is also claimed that, as a rule, the bitter almond trees\r\nbloom later in the spring than those of the other two groups, and\r\nfor this reason are not so liable to be injured by spring frosts.\r\nThe trees are hardy in all of our most favorable peach-growing\r\nregions of the Middle and Northern States, but some of the varieties\r\nripen rather too late for localities north of the latitude of New\r\nYork city. All this, however, and other obstacles, will soon\r\ndisappear, whenever the time arrives for our horticulturists to take\r\nup almond culture and pursue it with half the zeal they have the\r\ncultivation of the peach and many other kinds of fruits.\r\n\r\n=Hard-Shelled Almond=, _A. c. dulcis_, or sweet-kerneled\r\nalmond.--The varieties of this group, as a whole, differ from those\r\nof the next only in the firmness of their shells, which are\r\nmoderately firm, with a slightly rough and deeply pitted surface, as\r\nshown in Fig. 7. Varieties of this group are fully as large as, and\r\nperhaps a little longer than the thin-shelled, and the kernels are\r\nfully as valuable when removed and sold as shelled almonds. It may\r\nrequire a little more labor to crack and remove the kernels for\r\nmarket, but the difference is scarcely worth taking into\r\nconsideration by the grower.\r\n\r\nThe common sweet, hard-shelled almond thrives in peach-growing\r\nregions as far north as Central New York, and I well remember of\r\nseeing trees loaded with these nuts, in my boyhood days, in the\r\nwestern part of the State. The late Patrick Barry, in the Fruit\r\nGarden, when referring to this nut, says: \"This is a hardy and\r\nproductive tree, succeeding well in the climate of Western New York,\r\nand still farther north. Nut very large, with a hard shell and a\r\nlarge sweet kernel; ripe here (Rochester) about the first of\r\nOctober. The tree is very vigorous, has smooth, glaucous leaves, and\r\nwhen in bloom in the spring is more brilliant and showy than any\r\nother fruit tree.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. HARD-SHELLED ALMOND.]\r\n\r\nNearly every one of our noted horticulturists who have said anything\r\nabout almond culture in the North, agree with Mr. Barry in regard to\r\nthe beauty of this tree and its productiveness; but it is well to\r\nkeep in mind that it is no more to be depended upon than the peach,\r\nand the barren years will far outnumber the bearing ones. But the\r\nalmond is probably as certain here as in France, where it is\r\ncultivated extensively as an article of commerce, although a full\r\ncrop once in about five years is about all that is expected. We can\r\nprobably do much better than this, especially if proper attention is\r\ngiven to the production of new varieties adapted to our climate, as\r\nhas been done in California with the almond, and here in the East\r\nwith the peach and many other kinds of fruits; and when such have\r\nbeen secured, proceed to multiply them in the usual mode of budding\r\nupon seedling stocks.\r\n\r\n=Soft, or Brittle-Shelled=, _A. c. fragilis_.--In this group we have\r\nmany distinct varieties, besides others which are known by local\r\nnames, but have no permanent and pronounced distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics that would aid in separating them, should this be\r\ndesired. The most common form, widely known as the sweet-kerneled\r\nthin-shelled (Fig. 8), is one of the oldest in cultivation in\r\nEuropean countries. The flowers usually appear with the leaves, or\r\nbefore they unfold, and are large and of a pale rose color. The tree\r\nis rather tender for latitudes north of Philadelphia, but succeeds\r\nsouthward, and westward to the Pacific, if late frosts do not come\r\nto destroy the flowers or embryo nuts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. THIN-SHELLED ALMOND.]\r\n\r\n=Large Fruited Almond=, _A. c. macrocarpa_.--This is an old French\r\nvariety, and perhaps most widely known as the Sultana, although the\r\nlatter name is often applied in market to almost every variety of\r\nsweet almond. The leaves of the genuine variety are much broader\r\nthan those of the preceding groups, and are smooth and deep green.\r\nFlowers very large and showy, of a pale rose color, and always\r\nappear in spring before the leaves, and for this reason it has long\r\nbeen cultivated in England as an ornamental tree. Fruit large,\r\ndepressed or flattened at the base, but pointed at the top. Shell\r\nrather hard and firm, and will withstand rough handling and\r\ntransportation long distances. Kernel very sweet and tender, hence\r\nhighly prized everywhere. There are several sub-varieties; one,\r\nknown as the Pistache almond, is highly esteemed for the table, on\r\naccount of its delicate flavor, although it is very small and not\r\npopular for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n=The Peach Almond=, _A. c. persicoides_.--This is another old\r\nvariety, described by Du Hamel about the middle of the last century,\r\nunder the name of _Amandier-Pecher_, or peach-leaved almond. Leaves\r\nsimilar to those of the common peach. Fruit ovate, obtuse; husk\r\nslightly succulent; shell of a yellowish color, and the kernel\r\nsweet-flavored and excellent. Du Hamel says the fruit varies widely,\r\neven upon the same tree or branch, some having a dry, thin husk,\r\nwhile on others it is soft and fleshy, somewhat like that of the\r\npeach. As the almond and peach are of the same species, it would not\r\nbe at all strange if an occasional variety raised from the seed of\r\neither class should diverge towards, or even pass completely over to\r\na closely allied group.\r\n\r\nFrom the varieties found in the forementioned groups we must seek to\r\nfind, or produce therefrom, those which will succeed in this country\r\nwherever it may be thought desirable to attempt the cultivation of\r\nthis nut. So far as my knowledge extends, no attempts have, as yet,\r\nbeen made to produce distinct American varieties in the Eastern\r\nStates, as with its near relative, the peach, but all the almonds\r\nthus far cultivated here are of well-known foreign varieties.\r\nPerhaps the demand for almond trees has not been sufficient\r\nheretofore to encourage very extended experiments in this direction,\r\nbut I cannot believe that our people will continue for another\r\ncentury to import millions of pounds annually of almonds if it is\r\npossible to raise them in this country. That it is possible on the\r\nPacific coast has already been fully demonstrated, but we want to\r\nsee the field greatly enlarged, and give the people of the Eastern\r\nStates a share in what is evidently soon to become a large and\r\nprofitable industry.\r\n\r\n=Ornamental Varieties of the Almond.=--These are only referred to\r\nbecause some of the many in cultivation belong to the groups\r\nproducing the most valuable nuts, but the greater part of the purely\r\nornamental varieties are worthless for other purposes. _Amygdalus\r\ncochinchinensis_ grows to quite a large tree in its native country,\r\nor thirty to forty feet high; flowers small, white, produced in long\r\nracemes; tender._ A. orientalis_, a small shrub, with grayish or\r\nhoary leaves, and small rose-colored flowers; sometimes cultivated\r\nunder the name of _argentea_, or Silvery almond. _A. incana_ (hoary)\r\nis another dwarf species, from the Caucasus, with solitary red\r\nflowers. _A. nana_ and _A. pumila_ are oriental species of very\r\ndwarf shrubs, with either red or white flowers. The double-flowering\r\nvarieties of these have long been inhabitants of our gardens.\r\n\r\n=Properties and Uses.=--For domestic purposes the almond is highly\r\nesteemed wherever it is known, and is employed in hundreds of\r\ndifferent ways in the preparation of appetizing dishes and dainties\r\nfor the table. In countries where this nut is in cultivation, it is\r\nbrought to the table in the half-opened green husk, for at this time\r\nthe kernels are just passing from the milky stage, and are\r\nconsidered more readily digested than later, or when fully ripe. But\r\nit is only when they are fully mature that they are gathered for\r\nmarket, and after thorough drying they are placed in strong sacks\r\nand distributed among dealers in all parts of the world. But only\r\ncertain varieties are exported in this condition, and principally\r\nthose with very thin shells, because these are most in demand, for\r\nthe table and dessert, where the almond is not a home product. Other\r\nsweet varieties, whether with very hard or very tender shells, are\r\ncracked and only the kernels exported. The importation of shelled\r\nalmonds into this country is somewhat in excess of the unshelled,\r\nand as they are of greater value per pound, the duty levied is\r\nproportionally higher. There is also a great saving to the importer\r\nand consumer,--not only in freight, but the extraction of the\r\nkernels is done in countries where labor is abundant and cheap.\r\nWhether the almond shells are used for any purpose in European\r\ncountries, or are considered as wholly a waste product, I have been\r\nunable to learn, but it is asserted, and by men whose word is worthy\r\nof credence, that almond shells ground into a fine golden colored\r\nflour, is much used in this country for adulterating red pepper,\r\ncinnamon and other spices.\r\n\r\nAlmonds are not only used extensively at all times and seasons, by\r\npersons of all ages and sexes, at table and elsewhere, but they are\r\nemployed largely in the making of fancy confectionery with sugar, or\r\nin the form of salted almonds, the kernels having been first\r\nthoroughly steamed or scalded, to remove the skin, and then rolled\r\nor dusted with fine salt. Prepared in this way they are usually\r\nconsidered more readily digestible and healthful than in their\r\nnatural state.\r\n\r\nSweet almonds are also valued in the form of emulsions, as a\r\nmedicine in pulmonary disorders, and the oil of almonds is a common\r\nstandard article in the stock of druggists everywhere, as it enters\r\ninto the composition of cosmetics, syrups, pastes and powders of\r\nvarious kinds.\r\n\r\nThe kernels of the wild bitter almond contain a poisonous principle\r\nknown as hydrocyanic or Prussic acid, which does not exist in the\r\nsweet varieties, although found in their leaves and the bark of\r\ntheir twigs. But as bitter almonds are not palatable, there is\r\nlittle danger of anyone being poisoned from eating them, should\r\nthese nuts ever be cultivated here for any special purpose, as in\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n=Insects and Diseases.=--Whenever the almond tree becomes common\r\nhere in orchards it will doubtless suffer from the attacks of the\r\nsame kinds of natural enemies as affect the peach. One of the most\r\nwidely distributed of these pests is the common peach-tree borer.\r\nThe parents of these borers are small, slender-bodied, bluish,\r\ntransparent-winged moths, the male somewhat smaller than the female.\r\nThese moths usually appear in this latitude during the month of\r\nJune, and the female deposits her eggs on the stems of the trees\r\nnear the surface of the ground, or a little below it if she can find\r\na convenient opening to suit her purpose. The eggs deposited soon\r\nhatch, and the young larvae bore through the tender bark at this\r\npoint, and when fairly under it, branch off, cutting galleries\r\nthrough the soft alburnum underneath. When a number of these borers\r\nare at work on the same tree they sometimes girdle and kill it the\r\nfirst season, especially if it is young or a small specimen. But if\r\nthe tree is not killed outright it will show, by the check to its\r\ngrowth, that borers are at work. The borers continue feeding\r\nthroughout the remainder of the season, and up to the time freezing\r\nweather sets in for the winter, and if not full grown at this time\r\nthey will finish their growth early in spring, then crawl to near\r\nthe outside, or just under the old bark, and there spin a thin\r\ncocoon, in which they are transformed to the pupal stage, remaining\r\nin this form for a few weeks, then issuing in the winged or moth\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nIn the line of preventives and remedies there is nothing better than\r\nclean cultivation about the trees, and annual examination of each\r\ntree early in summer and the crushing of every borer found. The next\r\nbest thing, in the way of a preventive, is to wrap the stems from a\r\nlittle below the surface of the ground to a foot or more above it\r\nwith heavy paper, cloth, or bark of some kind, to keep the moth from\r\nlaying her eggs on the bark of the tree. I have used common tar\r\npaper for this purpose, not only because it is very cheap and does\r\nnot decay when exposed to the weather, but the exhalation or odor of\r\ntar seems to be offensive to the moths. In the use of this material\r\nI have never found that it was in the least injurious to the bark\r\nunderneath. Painting the stems with soap, cement, clay, or even\r\ncommon mineral paints, will answer very well if a little care is\r\ngiven to keeping down the number of insects by removing the larger\r\npart of the borers with knife or gouge.\r\n\r\nIn recent years a pest known as the \"shot-hole borer\" (_Scolytus\r\nrugulosus_) has appeared in many and widely separated localities, in\r\nboth the Eastern and Western States, attacking the almond, peach and\r\nplum tree. It is supposed to have been introduced from Europe with\r\nimported nursery stock, and thence rapidly distributed, by similar\r\nmeans, through the country. In its perfect stages it is a minute\r\nbrown beetle, about one-twelfth of an inch long and one-thirtieth of\r\nan inch in diameter. This pest appears about midsummer, boring\r\nnumerous minute holes through the bark and into the sapwood\r\nunderneath, and in this the female deposits her eggs, and from these\r\nare hatched the little grubs found later feeding on the soft inner\r\nbark and alburnous matter beneath it. From every hole made in the\r\nbark a small globule of gum will soon appear, drying upon the\r\nsurface--thence onward until autumn--and glistening in the sun, an\r\nimmutable sign of the presence of a minute but destructive enemy.\r\n\r\nWhen the beetles and their eggs are once in possession there is no\r\npractical way known of removing them, and the best thing to be done\r\nis to cut down and burn every infested tree, and just as soon as it\r\nis known to be in this condition. There are also several indigenous\r\nspecies of bark beetles, which will very likely attack almond trees\r\nas soon as they are as abundant as peach trees, but all may be\r\ndestroyed with the same, or very similar weapons and materials.\r\n\r\nWhat are called preventives consist mainly of substances to be\r\napplied to the stems in a semi-liquid form, and of such a nature as\r\nto be offensive to the beetles because of their odor, taste, or\r\nbecause so hard that the insects cannot cut through them with their\r\nmandibles. Common lime whitewash, soft soap, whale-oil soap, or a\r\nthin mineral paint made of pure linseed oil, will answer very well\r\nfor this purpose if applied often enough to keep the bark constantly\r\ncoated.\r\n\r\nOf the fungous diseases affecting the almond in this country, very\r\nlittle is as yet known, although we may safely include under this\r\nhead all those that have been inimical to the peach, for the\r\ntransition from this tree to the almond would only be a natural\r\nsequence. The peach-leaf curl (_Taphrina deformans_) would not be\r\nfar from home on the almond leaf, neither could we expect that\r\nalmond orchards would be wholly exempt from that mysteriously\r\ndistributed and uncontrollable disease known as \"peach yellows.\"\r\n\r\nIn California an almond-leaf blight has already appeared and\r\nseriously affected the trees in some of the orchards. It is caused\r\nby a fungus known as _Cercospora circumscissa_ Sacc. This fungus\r\nattacks the leaves and young twigs, causing the former to fall off\r\nearly in the season, thereby checking the growth of the tree and\r\npreventing the maturing of the fruit. It is thought that remedies\r\nmay be applied to check this disease, and there will probably be\r\nsome form of copper solution employed for destroying it, as with\r\nvarious species of fungi on other kinds of fruit trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE BEECHNUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFagus, _Linn._ The Beech. The Latin name of the genus (_Fagus_)\r\nsupposed to be an equivalent of the Greek phegos, an oak, or it may\r\nbe derived from _phago_, to eat; the nuts of this tree having been\r\nused as food by man in all ages and countries where it is a native.\r\nThe modern English name, beech, was probably derived from the\r\nAnglo-Saxon _bece_ or _boc_; in Dutch it is _beuk_; French, _hetre_;\r\nIcelandic, _beyk_; Danish, _bog_; Swedish, _bok_; German, _buche_ or\r\n_buoche_; Russian, _buk_; Italian, _faggio_; Armenian, _fao_; and in\r\nWelsh _ffawydd_.\r\n\r\nThe beech belongs to the order _Cupuliferae_, or oak family. The\r\ngenus contains about fifteen species of handsome deciduous and\r\nevergreen trees, or shrubs, very widely distributed throughout the\r\ntemperate and colder regions of both the northern and southern\r\nhemispheres. Male flowers are bell-shaped, in long-stalked drooping\r\nheads; calyx five to seven cleft, containing numerous stamens.\r\nFemale flowers two to four in a cluster on the summit of the\r\nscaly-bracted peduncle; the inside scales uniting, forming a\r\nfour-lobed involucre of imbricated bracts, the whole becoming at\r\nmaturity a somewhat prickly, scaly bur, within which are found a\r\npair of sharp-edged triangular nuts, containing a tender and\r\nsweet-flavored kernel.\r\n\r\n=History of the Beech.=--The common beeches of both Europe and North\r\nAmerica are so closely related that the two species may be\r\nconsidered as one for all practical purposes, such as propagation,\r\ncultivation, and value of the wood and nuts. It is true, however,\r\nthat our native beech is not environed with ancient myths and\r\nstories of love and war, neither is it celebrated in poetry and\r\nsong, yet it has, doubtless, played just as noble a part in human\r\naffairs among the pre-historic races of America as those recorded of\r\nits European contemporary. As the beech in Europe is found in the\r\nforests of Great Britain, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, and\r\nsouthward to Constantinople, Palestine, Asia Minor and Armenia, it\r\nwas well known and highly appreciated by all the early inhabitants\r\nof these countries, and is frequently referred to by the earlier\r\nwriters of Greece and Rome who touch upon the rural affairs of their\r\ntimes. It is supposed that Theophrastus refers to the beech under\r\nthe name of _Oxua_, and Dioscorides as _Phegos_, and the latter\r\nauthor places it among the oaks, in which he was not far out of the\r\nway, because the beech is a member of the oak family in our modern\r\nclassification. Virgil and Pliny speak highly of the little\r\ntriangular nuts, and the people of their times set considerable\r\nvalue upon beech-nuts as an article of food. Pliny also assures us\r\nthat at the siege of Chios, the besieged inhabitants lived for some\r\ntime entirely on these nuts. We are inclined to think, however, that\r\nboth Virgil and Pliny are in error when they tell us that the beech\r\nwas propagated by being grafted on the chestnut. They were probably\r\nled astray in this by some romancing gardener of their time, for we\r\neven have some of the same ilk with us at this day. Pliny refers to\r\nthe beech several times in his writings, and places a much higher\r\nvalue upon this nut than he does upon the chestnut; in fact, speaks\r\nrather contemptuously of the latter, and seems to be surprised that\r\nnature should have taken such care of the nuts, which he calls\r\n\"_vilissima_,\" as to enclose them with a prickly involucre or bur.\r\n\r\nBut my limited space will not allow of tracing the history of the\r\nbeech from ancient to modern times, although it has always been\r\nesteemed as food for man, as well as for wild and domesticated\r\nanimals. Swine fattened on beech and oak mast have for ages been\r\nnoted for their excellent flesh, and the value of many an old estate\r\nin Great Britain was determined more upon the mast the forest\r\nproduced, than the area or number of square miles they contained.\r\n\r\nAs a monumental tree the beech has no rival, for its smooth gray\r\nbark, perennial and almost unchangeable, has ever been a convenient\r\nplace to register challenges to enemies, epitaphs, epithets, and\r\nprobably more frequently than all, the initials of the name of some\r\nloved one, who might possibly pass that way and find her name\r\nengraved on the beechen tree. I doubt much if there is a beech grove\r\nin all Europe or in America, within a convenient distance of a city,\r\ncountry village or schoolhouse, on which the bark of the trees is\r\nnot scarified by the knives of boys in recording the initials of\r\ntheir own names, and those of their favorites of the opposite sex.\r\nThese living registers were long ago recognized by the poets, and\r\nmore than eighteen centuries ago Virgil admits it in these lines:\r\n\r\n    \"Or shall I rather the sad verse repeat,\r\n    Which on the beech's bark I lately writ.\"\r\n\r\nIn more modern times Tasso hints of the same habit, in _Jerusalem\r\nDelivered_, to wit:\r\n\r\n    \"On the smooth beechen rind, the pensive dame\r\n    Carves in a thousand forms her Tancred's name.\"\r\n\r\nThat the Spanish youths were not oblivious to their opportunities\r\nfor recording the names of their favorites we must assume to be\r\ntrue, from the lines of Don Luis de Gongora, who tells us that:\r\n\r\n    \"Not a beech but bears some cipher,\r\n       Tender word, or amorous text.\r\n    If one vale sounds Angelina,\r\n       Angelina sounds the next.\"\r\n\r\n=Propagation of the Beech.=--The beech, in all its species and\r\nvarieties, may be propagated by the usual modes, viz.: By seed,\r\nlayers, budding and grafting. The seeds, when gathered, should be\r\nmixed with clean, sharp, moist sand, placed in boxes, and then\r\nstored in a cool or cold place and carefully protected from mice,\r\nuntil the time arrives for sowing in spring. They may also be sown\r\nin the fall and lightly covered with leaf mold or other light soil,\r\nbut unless coated with tar or some offensive poisonous substance,\r\nvermin of some form will be very likely to find them and leave few\r\nto grow. Seedlings are used for stocks upon which to work the many\r\nvarieties in cultivation; but as I am not writing this for the\r\nencouragement of propagators of purely ornamental trees, I will omit\r\ngiving any very extended description of the different modes of\r\npropagating the beech, further than to say that should remarkably\r\nfine varieties with extra-sized nuts be discovered or produced, they\r\ncan be perpetuated and multiplied by the same processes adopted for\r\nother kinds of nut trees.\r\n\r\n=Soil and Location.=--The beeches of Northern countries, in their\r\nmany varieties, thrive best in a cool, moist soil, for their roots\r\nrarely penetrate very deeply, but spread out widely and near the\r\nsurface, forming an intricate network, which will try the patience\r\nof the woodman who attempts to clear away a forest of beech and\r\nbreak up the ground. In this country, as well as in Europe, the\r\nbeech thrives in calcareous soils, or what is usually termed\r\nlimestone regions; consequently, when transplanted or raised in\r\nsandy soils, or on the red sandstone formation, light applications\r\nof lime are usually found very beneficial; but more than all, the\r\nbeech requires moisture, and if not planted in a moist soil the\r\nsurface over the roots should be kept constantly covered with some\r\nkind of mulch.\r\n\r\n=Species and Varieties of the Beech.=--In the Dictionary of\r\nGardening, edited by George Nicholson, of the Royal Botanic Gardens,\r\nKew, England, the following species of Fagus are briefly described,\r\nviz:\r\n\r\n_F. antarctica._--Leaves ovate, blunt, glabrous, attenuated at the\r\nbase, doubly dentate, alternate, petiolate, one and a half inches\r\nlong. A small deciduous tree or shrub, with rugged, tortuous\r\nbranches. Native of Tierra del Fuego, S. A.\r\n\r\n_F. betuloides_ (birch-like). Evergreen beech.--Leaves ovate,\r\nelliptic, obtuse crenulate, leathery, shining glabrous, round at the\r\nbase or short footstalks. An evergreen tree, native of Tierra del\r\nFuego, S. A.\r\n\r\n_F. ferruginea_ (rusty). American beech.--Leaves ovate, acuminate,\r\nthickly toothed, downy beneath, ciliate on the margin. A large\r\ndeciduous tree, very closely resembling the common European species,\r\nfrom which it is distinguished by its longer, thinner and less\r\nshining leaves.\r\n\r\n_F. obliqua_ (oblique). Chile beech.--Leaves ovate, oblong, oblique,\r\nsomewhat rhomboid, blunt, doubly serrated, entire at the base,\r\nattenuated into the petiole, and somewhat downy. A hardy deciduous\r\ntree, native of the cooler elevated regions of Chile, S. A.\r\n\r\n_F. sylvatica_ (sylvan). European beech.--Leaves oblong, ovate,\r\nobscurely toothed; margin ciliate. A well-known large deciduous\r\ntree, widely distributed in Europe from Norway southward to Asia\r\nMinor. From this species a large number of ornamental varieties have\r\nbeen produced, many of them merely accidental variations of the wild\r\nforms of the forests, while others have originated in the seedbeds\r\nof nurserymen. But so far as I am aware, no variety has ever been\r\nintroduced bearing superior or improved forms of nuts.\r\n\r\nOur American beech (_F. ferruginea_) is a widely distributed tree,\r\nextending from Nova Scotia in the north, south to Florida, and\r\nwestward to Wisconsin and Missouri. Formerly it was exceedingly\r\nabundant, but like many other of our most valuable forest trees, it\r\nis disappearing before the axe of the woodman, who has always found\r\na ready sale for beech timber. It is used in the manufacture of\r\nplane stocks, shoe lasts, handles for paring chisels, and hundreds\r\nof similar articles. Beech wood is hard, firm, and takes a good\r\npolish, but is not very flexible. It makes excellent fuel, and ranks\r\nnext in value to hard maple and hickory for this purpose. In the\r\nmore northern States and where the beech grows to its largest size,\r\nthe heartwood is usually of a reddish color; but here in New Jersey\r\nand farther south, the wood is usually white almost to the center of\r\nthe tree, no matter how large it may be. The color of the wood,\r\nhowever, does not in any way detract from its value, for fuel and\r\nmany other purposes, although some European dendrologists have been\r\ndeceived into supposing that the white beech was almost or quite\r\nworthless. Loudon, in _Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum_, Vol.\r\nIII, in referring to our beech, says: \"The wood of the white beech\r\nis little valued in America, even for fuel; and the bark is used for\r\ntanning, but is little esteemed,\" etc. But if any one, in these\r\nlater years, has had occasion to purchase beech timber for any\r\npurpose, he has probably learned, from the price charged, that it is\r\nesteemed, even for such base purposes as firewood.\r\n\r\nI am not, however, attempting to extol the American beech as a\r\ntimber tree, but ask that it be given a place among the select\r\nornamental nut-bearing kinds. And I think every farmer who has a\r\npasture lot could afford a place for at least one beech tree, and if\r\nthere is a low, moist spot in the field, or a stony corner, this\r\nwill be a suitable place for such a tree; and the horses, cattle or\r\nsheep out in pasture during hot days in summer will be very grateful\r\nfor the shade which a wide-spreading specimen will give them. It may\r\nbe that the owner of said pasture may recall the lines of Garcilaso:\r\n\r\n         \"But in calm idlesse laid,\r\n         Supine in the cool shade\r\n    Of oak or ilex, beech or pendant pine,\r\n         Sees his flocks feeding stray,\r\n         Whitening a length of way,\r\n    Or numbers up his homeward-tending kine.\"\r\n\r\nHe may be sure of one thing, and that is, the beech-nuts produced by\r\none or many trees will always be acceptable to the children, and of\r\nthese hungry mortals there is likely to be a few, at least, roaming\r\nabout in ages to come, as in times past.\r\n\r\nThe beech is not really a desirable tree to plant on a lawn or near\r\none's dwelling, because of its persistent foliage, which clings to\r\nthe twigs very late in winter, and the rustling of the wind through\r\nthe dry leaves is not soothing to one's nerves, although not quite\r\nas dismal as the moaning pines. In summer, and until late in autumn,\r\nthe American beech is a noble and graceful tree,--and if I may be\r\nallowed the expression, one of the cleanest of trees; its large,\r\nthin, bright-green and glossy leaves retain none of the dust and\r\ncast-off material of other trees which may be floating through the\r\nair, but are ever bright and pure. The tree has naturally\r\nwide-spreading and somewhat drooping branches, and should be given\r\nplenty of room for development when planted for the nuts or as an\r\nornamental tree. Its leaves and the small slender branchlets (Fig.\r\n9) are eaten with avidity by all kinds of farm animals;\r\nconsequently, protection may be required until the trees have\r\nreached a hight to be safe from such depredators.\r\n\r\nBeech seedlings do not usually come into bearing in less than twenty\r\nto thirty years, but as no one in this country has ever attempted to\r\ncultivate this tree for its nuts, or search our forests for\r\nprecocious and superior varieties, we have to admit that the field\r\nremains unexplored, and as barren of results as it was when our\r\nancestors first discovered America. Every hunter, woodman, farmer\r\nand botanist who has roamed through forests where the beech trees\r\ngrow, is well aware of the fact that distinct varieties are not at\r\nall rare, some having nuts twice the size of others in the same\r\nwoods or groves, and it is possible and probable that some nut\r\nculturist in the near future will find time to select these choice\r\nwild varieties for cultivation and propagation. It would not, in my\r\nopinion, be beneath the dignity of our national department of\r\nagriculture, or some of its numerous costly annexes, to occasionally\r\ntake into consideration the natural products of this great country,\r\nand determine, by a series of experiments, whether or no they were\r\nnot worthy of attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. BEECHNUT LEAF, BUR AND NUT.]\r\n\r\n=Insects Injurious to the Beech.=--No disease has, as yet, been\r\nknown to seriously affect the beech, and as for insect enemies, it\r\nprobably has a less number than any other denizen of our forests. It\r\nis true that transplanted trees, and those left exposed by cutting\r\naway protecting neighbors, are sometimes attacked by borers in the\r\nstem, branches and twigs, but these enemies naturally follow in the\r\ntrain of debility, it being one of the immutable economic laws of\r\nnature to hasten the demise and decomposition of the half-starved or\r\notherwise enfeebled members of both the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nIsolated beech trees growing by the roadsides in parks and fields\r\nare occasionally attacked by a large grayish, long-horn beetle, the\r\n_Goes pulverulenta_. It is about one inch long, and a rather sturdy\r\nbeetle of a light grayish color, and usually infests the branches,\r\nbut may occasionally attack the main stem. It is not abundant, and\r\nhas seldom been found infesting the beech. There are also two or\r\nthree borers of the Buprestis family of beetles which occasionally\r\nattack beech trees. They are distinguished by the broad heads and\r\nflattened bodies of the grubs, and they work just beneath the bark\r\nin the sapwood, causing dead patches, mainly on the south side of\r\nthe stem and larger branches. If the dead bark is removed and the\r\nwounds painted they will soon heal over, unless the tree is\r\nsuffering for moisture and nutrients at the roots. A few twig\r\nborers, with an occasional colony of caterpillars on the leaves,\r\nembody about all the insect enemies of the beech calling for any\r\nspecial attention, but there are a host of different species and\r\nkinds ever ready to pounce upon a sickly or dead tree, whether found\r\nin the field or forest.\r\n\r\n=Properties and Uses.=--The beechnut has been so long and favorably\r\nknown that very little need be said here in regard to its properties\r\nand uses. In the forests it affords food for many kinds of birds,\r\nsuch as the wild turkey, partridge or grouse, and especially the\r\npigeon, and immense flocks of these collect in the beech forests in\r\nautumn to feed upon the nuts. Deer are very fond of these nuts, and\r\nso are all of the squirrel family, and the little ground squirrel or\r\nchipmunk, _Tamias striatus_, of our Northern States, gives us a good\r\npractical lesson in the way of preserving the nuts over winter.\r\nThese little rodents pack away the nuts in small pockets in their\r\nburrows and from two to three feet below the surface, where they are\r\nprotected from excessive moisture and any considerable change of\r\ntemperature. The chipmunk always stores the nuts in the ground, and\r\nnot in hollow logs, as is sometimes asserted. The deer-mouse\r\n(_Hesperomys leucopus_), however, does select such places for\r\nputting away his winter's supply, but more frequently he chooses a\r\nhollow in the stem of some old tree, and several feet from the\r\nground. Unlike the chipmunk, this mouse cleans the shells from the\r\nkernels, storing only the latter, and I have often found a quart or\r\nmore when cutting down trees in winter. These kernels are usually so\r\nclean, bright, and free from odor, that it is to be feared the\r\nfinder always confiscates them for his own use.\r\n\r\nAs the beechnut contains considerable oil, many schemes have been\r\nset on foot, in European countries, for its extraction and use as a\r\nsalad oil. Early in the last century (1721) Aaron Hill, an English\r\npoet, proposed to pay off the national debt from the profits to be\r\nderived from the manufacture of beechnut oil; but his scheme fell\r\nthrough, like many others of its kind. It is also stated that Henry\r\nFielding, so well known by his delightful stories of English\r\nsociety, once speculated rather largely on the manufacture of\r\nbeechnut oil. In France, however, beechnut oil was formerly made in\r\nconsiderable quantities, and used in cooking fish and as a salad\r\noil. In Silesia it is used by the country people instead of butter,\r\nand the cakes which remain from the pressure are given to fatten\r\nswine, oxen and poultry. The forests of Eu and of Crecy, in the\r\ndepartment of the Oise, it is stated by Duhamel du Monceau, have\r\nyielded, in a single season, more than 2,000,000 bushels of mast,\r\nbut probably this referred to all kinds of nuts, and not beech-nuts\r\nalone. Years later, or in 1779, Michaux states that the forests of\r\nCompiegne, near the Verberie department of the Somme, afforded oil\r\nenough to supply the wants of the district for more than half a\r\ncentury. In some parts of France beech-nuts are roasted and served\r\nas a substitute for coffee. Many of these old forests have\r\ndisappeared, but other kinds of nut trees are still being planted in\r\nFrance, and the product is simply enormous, and a source of wealth\r\nto the peasant, as well as the owners of extensive forests and\r\norchards.\r\n\r\nThe beechnut has never been an article of commerce in this country,\r\nand it is rarely seen on sale in either country villages or our\r\nlarger cities, not because of its scarcity or want of demand, but\r\nall that the country boys and girls find time to gather are wanted\r\nfor their own pleasure and use. Picking up beech-nuts among the\r\nleaves in a forest, or even after raking off the leaves and then\r\nwhipping the trees, is, at best, slow and rather tedious work, as I\r\nknow full well from experience, and only once do I remember of\r\nhaving secured a rounded half bushel as the sum total of many raids\r\non the beech trees in the neighborhood. But as the beechnut is the\r\ndiamond among the larger and less precious gems of our forests, we\r\nshould set a higher value upon it because small and rather difficult\r\nto obtain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCASTANOPSIS.\r\n\r\nCalifornia chestnut. Western chinquapin. Evergreen chestnut.\r\n\r\n\r\nCastanopsis, Spach. Name derived from _Castanea_, the chestnut.\r\nOrder, _Cupuliferae_. A genus of evergreen shrubs and trees,\r\nintermediate between the oaks (_Quercus_) and the chestnuts\r\n(_Castanea_). There are about a dozen species indigenous to Eastern\r\nAsia and the adjacent islands. Blume, in \"Flora Javae,\" Vol. II,\r\n1828-36, describes three species under _Castanea_, which he found in\r\nthe mountains and more elevated regions of the Javanese islands.\r\nVery little, however, is known of these oriental evergreen chestnuts\r\noutside of the herbariums of professional botanists, and they are\r\nrarely referred to, even in standard botanical dictionaries, or\r\ndictionaries of gardening, and when mentioned they are usually\r\nplaced in the genus _Castanea_. Edouard Spach, a half-century or\r\nmore ago, gave a synopsis of the genus, for which he proposed the\r\nname of _Castanopsis_, and although not recognized by botanists in\r\ngeneral for a number of years, it is now accepted by botanical\r\nauthorities everywhere. We have but one indigenous species, and this\r\non the Pacific coast, viz:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. LEAVES AND NUT OF CASTANOPSIS CHRYSOPHYLLA.]\r\n\r\n_Castanopsis chrysophylla_, A. de Candolle. _Castanea chrysophylla_,\r\nDouglas. _Castanea sempervirens_, Kellogg.\r\n\r\n    \"Leaves coriaceous, evergreen, lanceolate or oblong, one to four\r\n    inches long, acuminate or only acutish (Fig. 10), cuneate at\r\n    base and shortly petioled, entire green and glabrous above or\r\n    somewhat scurfy, densely scurfy beneath, with none or few yellow\r\n    scales; male aments one to three inches long, densely pubescent;\r\n    styles three, stout, glabrous, divergent; fruiting involucre\r\n    with stout divergent spines (Fig. 11) one-half to one inch long,\r\n    subverticillately many branched; nut usually solitary, obversely\r\n    triangular, six lines long.\"--\"Geological Survey of California,\"\r\n    Botany, Vol. II, p. 100.\r\n\r\n    \"This handsome broad-leaved evergreen tree is indigenous to the\r\n    elevated regions, from Monterey, California, northward to the\r\n    Columbia river in Oregon. It is also common in the Sierra\r\n    Nevadas at elevations of six thousand feet, but in its southern\r\n    limits rarely below ten thousand feet elevation.\"--C. S. Sargent\r\n    (\"Woods of the United States\").\r\n\r\nIn the warmer and drier regions of California it is a mere shrub two\r\nto six feet high, and these dwarf forms have, in some instances,\r\nbeen described as varieties. As, for instance, _Castanea\r\nchrysophylla_, var. _minor_, Bentham; _C. chrysophylla_, var.\r\n_minor_, A. de Candolle; and _C. chrysophylla_, var. _pumila_,\r\nVasey. But northward, where the climate is more moist, it becomes a\r\nlarge tree fifty to one hundred and twenty feet high, with a stem\r\ntwo to three feet in diameter. In its wide variation in habit of\r\ngrowth, this western chinquapin is similar to our Eastern dwarf\r\nchestnut, which is mainly a low shrub in the more Southern States,\r\nbut becomes a fair-sized tree in the Middle States, or near its\r\nnorthern limits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. CASTANOPSIS BUR.]\r\n\r\nI have introduced the Western chinquapin here among the nut-bearing\r\ntrees, not with the idea that it will ever be extensively cultivated\r\nfor its edible nuts, but because it is a beautiful broad-leaved\r\nevergreen tree, and of which we have far too few kinds in\r\ncultivation to give warmth and a cheerful aspect to our gardens and\r\npleasure grounds in winter. It is true that, so far as can be\r\nlearned at this time, no extended experiments have ever been made to\r\nintroduce or cultivate the Castanopsis in the Atlantic States,\r\nconsequently nothing positive is known as to whether it will succeed\r\nhere or not. In its northernmost range it thrives in forests among\r\nmany kinds of trees and shrubs that are already common in our\r\ngardens, and this leads me to think that specimens or seeds of this\r\ntree procured from the mountains of northern Oregon will withstand\r\nthe rigors of our climate.\r\n\r\nMr. S. B. Parsons writes me that he first saw _Castanopsis\r\nchrysophylla_ in Kew Gardens (Eng.) thirty-five years ago, and\r\nprocured specimens, which were planted in his gardens at Flushing,\r\nN. Y., but they failed, presumably because not hardy. It may be that\r\nhis specimens were raised from nuts procured in the warmer part of\r\nCalifornia, and, as with many other Pacific coast plants, proved to\r\nbe tender, while later introductions of the same species collected\r\nin colder localities have proved hardy here. In my experience I have\r\nfound a great difference in the hardiness of trees and plants\r\nobtained from the higher and lower levels of the mountains from\r\nColorado westward to the Coast range, for in those regions\r\nacclimation extending over thousands of years has developed and\r\nfixed certain physiological attributes, which enables them to\r\nreadily adapt themselves to similar conditions elsewhere, especially\r\nin the line of temperature. It may make no difference to those who\r\nwant plants for warm climates, whether they are obtained from\r\nmountain or valley, but it certainly does to those who value\r\nhardiness above all other merits.\r\n\r\nIn horticultural matters we are supposed to confine ourselves within\r\ncertain natural lines in making experiments, but if we fail in one,\r\nor one hundred, it proves little beyond the bare fact that we have\r\nnot been successful. I have experimented enough to have become\r\nsomewhat wary of deciding that a thing cannot be done, or is\r\nimpossible, because of my own and others' failures. Every practical\r\nhorticulturist can call to mind many productions which had evaded\r\nthe pursuit of experimenters for decades and even centuries.\r\n\r\nFor specimens of the nuts, burs and plants of this handsome\r\nnut-bearing tree I am indebted to Mr. J. J. Harden, of Stayton,\r\nOregon, who informs me that it grows in the mountains near by to a\r\nvery large size, and among such well-known kinds of shrubs and trees\r\nas _Rhamnus Purshianus_, _Cornus Nuttalli_, _Corylus rostrata_, and\r\nvarious species of conifers which are now more or less common in our\r\nEastern gardens and parks. The twigs and leaves are shown in Fig.\r\n10, and below a nut, and in Fig. 11 a bur, all of natural size. The\r\nsmall conical nut is slightly triangular, with a rather firm,\r\nbrittle shell, not fibrous as in the acorn and chestnut. The burs\r\nare produced singly, but sometimes several on a twig, and when\r\nmature, instead of opening by valves, as in the true chestnut, they\r\nbreak up irregularly. The kernels are sweet and excellent flavored,\r\nand are sought for by various kinds of birds, as well as by all the\r\nsquirrel tribe, and for this reason it is very difficult to procure\r\nspecimens, unless gathered before they are fully ripe. The nuts do\r\nnot mature the first season, but pass the winter in a partly\r\ndeveloped stage, usually ripening the second year about midsummer\r\nor, in northern Oregon, in July.\r\n\r\nIt is quite probable that this Castanopsis, when planted in the\r\nAtlantic States, will require a little shade or protection, like the\r\nAmerican holly and similar broad-leaved evergreens, and while it may\r\nnot thrive anywhere north of Delaware and Maryland, it is worth\r\ntrying, as the sole native representative of a genus containing\r\nseveral species of noble evergreen trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE CHESTNUT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. CHESTNUT FLOWERS.]\r\n\r\nCastanea, _Tournefort_. The ancient classical name derived either\r\nfrom Castanis, a town in Thessaly, or one in Pontius, as historians\r\ndisagree in regard to its derivation. The genus belongs to the order\r\n_Cupuliferae_.\r\n\r\nMale flowers irregularly clustered in long, naked, cylindrical\r\ncatkins from the axils of the leaves and on the new shoots of the\r\nseason. Calyx five or six parted; stamens or pollen-bearing organs\r\nseven to fifteen; anther two-celled. On old, mature trees, the male\r\ncatkins are usually crowded near the end of the short new twigs, as\r\nshown in Fig. 12, the terminal one productive; but on young thrifty\r\ntrees, wide apart. Female flowers always on and near the base of a\r\nlate-developed male catkin, sometimes two or three together,--or\r\neven six or eight on the chinquapins,--oval or ovoid, scaly,\r\nprickly, two- to four-valved involucre or bur; calyx usually with a\r\nfour- to six-lobed border crowning the three- to seven-celled ovary;\r\nstigmas bristle-shaped, and as many in number as there are cells in\r\nthe ovary. Shell of the nut leathery, not brittle, ovoid, two or\r\nmore together in the larger species, in others solitary, or only one\r\nin a bur. Kernel very thick, fleshy, and somewhat plaited, sweet and\r\nedible.\r\n\r\nBoth male and female flowers appear late in spring, the males\r\nusually exceedingly so, exhaling a slightly nauseating odor. The\r\nproductive male catkins appear the latest, their base becoming the\r\nrachis or stalk supporting the burs, this rather anomalous\r\narrangement appearing to be a natural provision to secure\r\nfertilization in case the earlier catkins failed.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Castanea_, as now restricted, contains shrubs and large\r\ntrees, with simple, alternate deciduous leaves, coarsely serrate,\r\nwith pointed spiny teeth. Indigenous, and widely distributed over\r\nnorthern Africa, southern Europe, Asia and the eastern half of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe common English name of this nut is supposed to be derived from\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon _cystel_, chestnut, and _cyst-beam_ or\r\n_cisten-beam_, chestnut tree; Old English, _chastein_ or _chesten_;\r\nOld German, _chestinna_ or _kestinna_; Modern German, _kestene_ or\r\n_kastanie_; French, _castaigne_ or _chataigne_; Provencal,\r\n_castanha_; Spanish, _castana_; Italian, _castagna_, from the Latin\r\n_castanea_.\r\n\r\n=History of the Chestnut.=--The so-called European chestnut is\r\nsupposed to be indigenous to Asia Minor, Armenia, Caucasus and\r\nnorthern Africa, and from these countries it was introduced and\r\nbecame naturalized throughout the greater part of temperate Europe,\r\nwhere it has been cultivated from time immemorial. The Romans are\r\nsupposed to have distributed it northward through France and Great\r\nBritain, and in the latter country there were trees centuries ago of\r\nsuch large size that many of the early English authors claimed this\r\ntree was indigenous. But in the absence of any natural forests of\r\nchestnut, the claim had to be abandoned. In parts of France, Italy\r\nand Spain, the chestnut has become thoroughly naturalized and, as we\r\nmay say, run wild, but as one of the early investigators says, in\r\nspeaking of the abundance of old chestnut trees on the Apennines,\r\nthey are generally scattered over the surface like trees on a\r\nwell-arranged lawn, and not crowded and massed, as they would be in\r\na state of nature or in a forest. On the south side of the Alps the\r\ntrees grow up to an altitude of twenty-five hundred feet, and on the\r\nPyrenees some two or three hundred feet higher.\r\n\r\nThere are old trees of immense size almost everywhere in the milder\r\nregions of Europe, and the celebrated monarchs of Etna have been\r\nmany times described by travelers. The largest measure one hundred\r\nand eighty feet in circumference near the root. All the early Roman\r\nwriters who have anything to say about rural affairs, mention the\r\nchestnut as one of their valuable trees, producing nuts used for\r\nvarious purposes. Pliny enumerates eight varieties, but Columella\r\nappears to place more value upon the timber, especially the sprouts,\r\nfor stakes, than he does on the nuts. But long before the Romans\r\nbegan to cultivate the chestnut, the Greeks held it in high esteem\r\nunder the name of _Sardianos Balanos_ or Sardis nut, and still later\r\nit was called _Dios Balanos Lopimon_.\r\n\r\nThe European chestnut has been so frequently and extensively\r\nreferred to by ancient and modern authors that it would not be at\r\nall difficult to fill a large volume with brief extracts from their\r\nworks, but my aim is not so much to show what has been done with\r\nthis nut in other countries as what we may do with it here. All\r\nnations who have any experience with it admit its value as food for\r\nmany wild and domesticated animals, as well as for the human race,\r\nand we know, from our long experience with the native species, that\r\nit is highly esteemed wherever known, although it must be admitted\r\nthat our sparse population and the abundance of other kinds of food,\r\nhave tended to make us careless and neglectful of the indigenous\r\nchestnut.\r\n\r\nIt may be well, before dismissing this brief history of the\r\nchestnut, to add that while nearly all the ancient authors, in\r\nreferring to it, employed its present scientific name of _Castanea_,\r\nstill, when botanists first attempted what has since been recognized\r\nas the scientific classification of plants, many of them placed the\r\nchestnut in the same genus as the beech, retaining the generic name\r\nof _Fagus_ for both.\r\n\r\nLinnaeus, in his _Systema Naturae_, 1766, Vol. II, p. 630, describes\r\ntwo species of the chestnut and one of beech in the genus _Fagus_,\r\nalthough Tournefort, in his \"History of Plants Growing About Paris,\"\r\npublished seventy years before that of Linnaeus, had recognized the\r\ndistinctive characteristics of these two groups of nut trees, and he\r\nadopted the present name of _Castanea_ for the generic name of the\r\nchestnut, and _Fagus_ for that of the beech. But nearly all of the\r\nEnglish and earlier American botanists adopted and followed Linnaeus\r\nin his classification, ignoring the works of the earlier as well as\r\ncontemporaneous continental botanists. I merely refer to this matter\r\nof botanical nomenclature because some of my readers may have\r\noccasion to consult the earlier authors who describe American\r\nplants, as, for instance, such works as John Clayton's \"Flora of\r\nVirginia,\" 1739, Thomas Walter's \"Flora Caroliniana,\" 1787, or\r\nHumphrey Marshall's \"American Grove,\" 1785. In all of these, and\r\nothers, the chestnut is described as a species of beech (_Fagus_).\r\n\r\n=Propagation of the Chestnut.=--The usual mode of propagating the\r\nchestnut is from seed, when trees are wanted for general planting or\r\nfor stocks upon which to graft improved and rare varieties. Under\r\nsome conditions and circumstances, it is best to plant the nuts soon\r\nafter they are ripe in autumn, and this appears to be the most\r\nnatural method; in fact, it is the way in which forests have been\r\nproduced and are constantly renewed and perpetuated, when man does\r\nnot interfere to prevent it. But nature is in no hurry in such\r\nmatters, while man always is, because his time is limited;\r\nconsequently, in our attempts at the multiplication and cultivation\r\nof plants we aim to save both time and material, therefore cannot\r\nafford to adopt nature's slow and wasteful processes.\r\n\r\nThe principal objection to planting chestnuts in the fall is the\r\ndanger of having them destroyed by vermin, which abound almost\r\neverywhere. There is also danger of the nuts sprouting prematurely\r\nin the autumn, and of the young growth being killed by cold or by\r\nexcessive moisture during late fall rains. But these natural enemies\r\nand obstacles prevent an excess in number and the overcrowding of\r\ntrees in our forests. It is, no doubt, possible and practicable to\r\nsmear the nuts with poisonous substances, or those sufficiently\r\noffensive to prevent the depredations of vermin, but taking all\r\nthings into consideration, I am decidedly in favor of preserving the\r\nnuts in bulk and in a dormant state until the season arrives for\r\ninsuring a rapid and continuous growth, and then planting them. To\r\ndo this in our cold northern climate, as well as in the South,\r\nrequires more care and attention with chestnuts than with the\r\nharder-shelled kinds, like the walnut and hickory nut. As a rule, it\r\nmay be said that all the hardy kinds of nuts sprout at a rather low\r\ntemperature and a few degrees above the freezing point, and for this\r\nreason it is well to select as cool a spot in the open ground as\r\npossible for their winter quarters, and then examine them as early\r\nas can be done conveniently in the spring.\r\n\r\nIn this matter of manipulating and preserving chestnuts for\r\nplanting, as well as what follows in regard to transplanting,\r\npruning and grafting, I shall give my own practice, with results;\r\nand while it may differ from that of other propagators, it is one\r\nevolved from long experience, many successes, and a few failures.\r\n\r\n=Gathering and Assorting Nuts.=--When the nuts begin to ripen and\r\nfall, gather as soon as possible, and if the trees are on your own\r\ngrounds and will admit of such an operation, thrash them and secure\r\nthe entire crop at once. The object of this early gathering is to\r\ncollect the false and weevil-infested specimens and destroy them.\r\nBut in whatever way the nuts are collected, they should be stored in\r\nthe shade and in shallow boxes, or spread out on a tight floor; but\r\nthe better way would be on screens over a floor, and then when the\r\ngrubs worked their way downward through the nuts and screen, they\r\nwould fall upon the floor, from which they could be taken up and\r\nburned or otherwise destroyed. The nuts, while on the screen or\r\nother receptacle, should be stirred over daily for two or three\r\nweeks, and by that time they will be in good condition for either\r\nplanting or packing away for the winter. But before finally\r\ndisposing of the nuts in either way, they should be carefully looked\r\nover, and every shrunken specimen, as well as all with punctured\r\nshells from which the grubs have escaped, removed from among the\r\nsound stock, because these damaged nuts are not only useless, but\r\nare very likely to decay and affect all with which they come in\r\ncontact. It is not to be expected that by such means or handling we\r\ncan get rid of all the grubs enclosed in the nuts when gathered, for\r\nthere will always be a few not more than half grown at the time, and\r\nthese will remain hidden in the nuts until midwinter, or later, but\r\nthe greater part of the brood will reach maturity within two or\r\nthree weeks after the nuts are ripe. Of course, what is said here\r\nabout chestnut weevils is only applicable to chestnuts grown in this\r\ncountry, but all species and varieties, when planted here, are\r\nsubject to the attacks of this pest--at least, everywhere in the\r\nEastern and Southern States.\r\n\r\nHaving assorted the nuts carefully, the sound ones should be\r\nreserved for planting; these should be mixed with or stratified with\r\nmoist, sharp sand, and stored in boxes of convenient size for\r\nhandling and examination, whenever this is required. In preparing\r\nthe boxes, bore a number of small holes through the bottom, and over\r\neach of these lay a piece of a broken flower-pot, brick or stone,\r\nthen cover the bottom one inch deep with the moist sand, and on this\r\nplace a single layer of nuts, then fill in all interstices with\r\nsand, and also use enough more to fairly cover the layer; and\r\nproceed in this way until all the nuts are disposed of or the box is\r\nfull, covering the top layer one or two inches deep, because the\r\nsand will settle some after the work seems complete. The boxes may\r\nbe covered with fine wire netting or with narrow strips of boards,\r\nfitting these so that mice cannot get in, but should not be\r\nair-tight. They may then be buried in the open ground, selecting\r\nsome knoll or dry spot for this purpose, for the nuts should not be\r\nplaced where they will be submerged, or even be watersoaked, at any\r\ntime during the fall, winter or early spring. If no such spot is\r\nconveniently near, then set the boxes on the top of the ground, and\r\non the north side of some building or in the shade of an evergreen\r\ntree, and bank over with soil, covering the boxes a foot deep. If\r\nthe spot selected is under the eaves of a building, place boards\r\nover the heap of soil, to carry off the water, for the object is to\r\nkeep the nuts moderately moist, cool, and where they will not be\r\nsubjected to frequent changes of temperature. In our Northern States\r\nthe nuts, under such conditions, usually become frozen during the\r\ncoldest weather, but this does not injure them if the sand is moist\r\nand they remain frozen, as there will be no danger of germination;\r\nwhile if kept too warm, they may start to grow before the seedbed is\r\nready, in spring, for their reception. I have tried keeping the nuts\r\nmixed with sand in a cool cellar, also in outbuildings, but have not\r\nfound any other place so certain as pits in the open ground.\r\n\r\n=Seedbed and Soil.=--It is well to have the seedbed prepared the\r\nprevious autumn, but it is not absolutely necessary. The soil for\r\nthe bed should be light, either sandy or loamy, and if not rich,\r\nmade so by adding very old and fine stable manure, or leaf mold from\r\nthe forest--I prefer the latter, as it is the most natural for all\r\nkinds of seedling nut trees. Whatever fertilizing materials are\r\nused, they should be placed on or near the surface, and never worked\r\nin deeply, for our aim should be the production of side or lateral\r\nfibers, and not coarse perpendicular roots. Furthermore, seedling\r\nnut trees grown on light, sandy soils or in pure leaf mold, produce\r\na far greater number of small fibrous roots than on heavy soils, and\r\nthis is a decided advantage with those which are to be transplanted.\r\n\r\n=Planting the Nuts.=--When the time arrives for planting, take the\r\nnuts from their winter quarters, and after sifting out the sand, sow\r\nor drop them in drills, covering about two inches deep with fine\r\nsoil. With the small native varieties my practice has been to sow in\r\nwide drills; that is, those made with the blade of a common garden\r\nhoe, and of the same width, the nuts being scattered along the\r\nbottom two to three inches apart.\r\n\r\nThe soil is then drawn in over them and pressed down with the back\r\nof the hoe, or by passing a light garden roller over the surface. If\r\nthe size of the seedbed is not limited, or only a small quantity of\r\nnuts are to be sown, then the single row would be preferable,\r\nbecause less hand weeding will be needed to subdue the weeds, and\r\nfor all the larger varieties I should certainly recommend it,\r\nbecause they are of a more stocky growth. The distance allowed\r\nbetween the drills will depend somewhat upon the implements to be\r\nemployed in cultivation, as well as how long the seedlings are to\r\nremain in the seedbed before transplanting, but from two to three\r\nfeet will be found convenient for the ordinary modes of cultivation.\r\n\r\nIf the seedlings make a fair average growth the first season they\r\nwill be from one to three feet high in the autumn, and as soon as\r\nthe leaves have fallen they may be taken up, or allowed to remain\r\nuntil the following spring and then lifted. But if, from any cause,\r\nthey have made a feeble growth, it is better to let them remain in\r\nthe seedbed another year. Where large quantities of seedlings are\r\nraised they are usually taken up with a tree-digger drawn by a span\r\nof horses or mules, but with only a few hundred or a thousand to\r\ndig, a common spade will answer every purpose; and if, when removed\r\nfrom the seedbed, they are found to have produced long perpendicular\r\ntaproots, these should be shortened to about one-half their original\r\nlength. For instance, if these taproots are taken up entire and are\r\neighteen to twenty inches long, cut away the lower half, whether it\r\nconsists of one or more long perpendicular roots, as this pruning\r\nwill force the plants to produce a greater number of lateral roots,\r\nand it is upon these we depend mainly for keeping our trees alive\r\nand vigorous if transplanted when larger and older. All side\r\nbranches should be pruned off close to the main stem, for we aim to\r\nfavor the latter in its growth upward until it reaches the required\r\nhight for either grafting or forming the future head of the tree.\r\n\r\nIn taking up seedlings, it is not safe to leave them for any\r\nconsiderable time exposed to the sun and drying winds, and they\r\nshould be carried either to a shed or other building while being\r\npruned, and also covered with blankets in the field, except during\r\nmoist, cloudy days. A very little drying of the small fibers on such\r\nplants is always more or less injurious.\r\n\r\n=Planting in Nursery Rows.=--After the seedlings have been taken\r\nfrom the seedbed and pruned, they should be set out in nursery rows,\r\nfour feet apart, and the plants about eighteen inches in the row.\r\nTrenches should be opened for the reception of the plants, and wide\r\nenough to allow all the roots to be spread out in a natural\r\nposition; and it is well to set a little deeper than the seedlings\r\nwere in the seedbed, because newly plowed ground will settle some\r\nafter the planting is finished, although the soil should always be\r\npacked firmly about the stems of newly set trees, whether large or\r\nsmall. The more frequent and thorough the cultivation during the\r\nensuing summer, the more rapid will be the growth of the trees.\r\n\r\nIf the transplanted seedlings have produced any considerable number\r\nof side branches,--and especially, low down,--these may be pruned\r\noff at any time during the summer, for our object is usually to\r\nsecure straight, upright stems for grafting the following spring, if\r\nthey are large and tall enough; if not, we may delay this operation\r\nfor another year. Of course, small chestnut stocks may be grafted\r\nclose to the ground, but there is nothing really gained by this, for\r\na good strong stock will push a cion forward more in one season than\r\na weak stock in two or three seasons. But when the stocks have\r\nreached a diameter of from three-eighths to one-half an inch three\r\nor four feet from the ground, they may be grafted, but I would\r\nprefer to have them a little over than under these sizes.\r\n\r\n=Stocks From the Forests.=--It is not necessary for a man who may\r\nneed a few chestnut stocks for experimental or other purposes, to\r\nwait until they can be grown from the nut, because these can always\r\nbe purchased at the nurseries; but if one does not wish to incur\r\neven this small outlay, it may be avoided by obtaining a supply from\r\nthe forests, provided there are any in the neighborhood where\r\nchestnut seedlings are to be found, and the owner will permit their\r\nremoval. The best wild stocks are usually to be found in recent\r\nclearings, or where the larger trees have been cut off for timber,\r\nand the underbrush, composed of seedlings and sprouts, is left to\r\ngrow up again into a forest. There are many thousands of acres in\r\nNew Jersey, New York, and other Eastern States, from which the\r\ntimber is cut every twenty or thirty years, and no further attention\r\npaid to the land or what it produces. Wherever such clearings are\r\nfound containing chestnut trees, good stocks can usually be procured\r\nby selecting those varying from one to two inches in diameter at the\r\nground, and if the soil in which they are growing is rather poor and\r\nstony they will usually have pretty good roots, if carefully taken\r\nup. They should be pruned to a single stem, and this cut off at a\r\nhight of from five to six feet or less, then planted where they are\r\nto remain permanently. Such stocks, if carefully taken up and\r\nplanted, will throw out numerous sprouts from their stems during the\r\nsummer, but all should be rubbed off while small and tender, except\r\nthree or four at the top, and the following spring, if wanted for\r\nthis purpose, they may be grafted in the same way as the young\r\nstocks growing in the nursery, thereby saving three or four years of\r\ntime in securing bearing trees. Having often employed such wildings\r\nfor stocks with just as good results as with those raised from the\r\nnuts in nursery rows, I am inclined to recommend them, where\r\nobtainable, knowing that there are thousands of farmers and owners\r\nof small places in the country who can do likewise, but may have\r\nnever thought it practicable to transplant nut trees from the\r\nforest, although well aware of the fact that elms, maples, and\r\nsimilar kinds were obtained there, and in immense numbers, for\r\nplanting in the streets of villages and alongside country highways.\r\n\r\n=The Season for Grafting.=--The proper time for grafting the\r\nchestnut is in early spring, just as the buds begin to swell, but\r\nnot until all danger of freezing weather is past, although light\r\nfrosts will not seriously injure newly set cions. The grafting may\r\nbe continued while the leaves are unfolding, provided the cions were\r\ncut early and stored in a cool place, where they remain in a dormant\r\nstate until used. I usually cut the shoots wanted for this purpose\r\nduring the late fall or winter, and then pack them away in a cool\r\ncellar between layers of damp moss (_sphagnum_) to be obtained in\r\nalmost any swamp. Cions may be taken from the tree on the same day\r\nthat they are used, but there is some risk in this, because we\r\ncannot control the weather, and a week of warm rain in spring may\r\ndelay us in grafting, while it is pushing our stocks into leaf; and\r\nthen, our dormant cions are available, while those on the trees are\r\nnot, owing to their expanded and tender buds.\r\n\r\nThe shoots used for cions are those of the previous season's growth,\r\nor as usually termed, one-year-old wood; and in selecting these,\r\nendeavor to get such as are plump, well ripened and firm. If taken\r\nfrom young and very thrifty chestnut trees, there is likely to be a\r\nconsiderable portion of the upper end of the shoot that is rather\r\nsoft, spongy and immature, and this should be discarded, as it would\r\nbe a waste of time to use it. Of course, I am supposing that the\r\ngrafter is so fortunate as to be able to make his own selection of\r\nthe wood desired; if not, then he may be compelled to do the best he\r\ncan with that obtained elsewhere.\r\n\r\n=Grafting Materials.=--The really essential materials and implements\r\nrequired in grafting nut trees are few in number. Grafting wax must\r\nbe provided, and while there are many different compositions used\r\nfor this purpose, I much prefer, for ordinary work in the open air,\r\na wax made after the old formula, and as follows: Take one pound of\r\ncommon rosin, one-half pound of beeswax, and one-quarter of a pound\r\nof beef tallow; melt together and stir enough to insure the thorough\r\nintermingling of the ingredients, and then set away to cool, or pour\r\ninto cold water and work up into cakes or rolls and wrap in paper\r\nuntil wanted for use. Larger quantities may be made if required,\r\npreserving the same proportions of the materials used. If to be used\r\nimmediately in grafting chestnuts and similar trees, then procure\r\nsome sheets of tough Manilla paper of only moderate thickness, and\r\ncut this up into sheets about six inches wide and a foot long. While\r\nthe fresh-made wax is melted, take an old and rather stiff paint\r\nbrush, dip it into the hot wax and coat the papers thinly with it,\r\nand then spread them out on shelves or elsewhere to cool, and let\r\nthem remain undisturbed until wanted for use. Any thin kind of cloth\r\nmay be used instead of paper, but I prefer the latter because it\r\nwill yield to the pressure of the enlarging stock and cion when\r\ngrowth begins, and it will not be necessary to examine the grafted\r\nstock so frequently during the summer to prevent girdling, as is\r\nusually the case when a tougher material is employed for wrappers.\r\nBefore these waxed sheets are taken into the field for use, lay each\r\none separately on a piece of board with the waxed side up, and with\r\nthe point of a sharp knife cut them crossways into narrow strips of\r\nfrom one-half to three-fourths of an inch wide. But for convenience\r\nin handling, insert the point of the knife a half-inch from one\r\nedge, but cut the other clean through, so that the whole sheet of\r\nstrips can be lifted together.\r\n\r\nIn early spring there is usually more or less windy weather, and if\r\nwaxed sheets of paper are taken out into the field unprotected they\r\nare very likely to become tangled up and useless. To prevent this,\r\nprocure a number of large but very shallow paper boxes, such as can\r\nusually be had at the stores and groceries of almost any village,\r\nand in these place a single layer of the cut waxed sheets, where\r\nthey will be protected from wind and dust until removed for\r\nimmediate use.\r\n\r\nOther kinds of grafting wax can, of course, be used, and are usually\r\nprocurable at the seed stores or made at home, and I have given\r\ntheir composition and the formulas for their manufacture in my work,\r\n\"The Propagation of Plants;\" but, as I have already said, this old\r\nstandard kind of wax is just as good as any other, although a little\r\nmore troublesome to use on account of its sticky consistency. Raffia\r\nor bass may be employed as ligatures for holding the cions in place,\r\nthen covered with Leport's or other kinds of liquid grafting wax;\r\nbut when these are employed it will be necessary to examine the\r\ngrafted trees frequently, in order to cut the ligatures to prevent\r\ngirdling.\r\n\r\nThe best implement for grafting is a common broad-blade pocket\r\nknife. One with a blade three to three and a half inches long and\r\nthree-fourths of an inch wide, is a handy size. It should be of the\r\nbest material for grafting chestnuts, because the wood of this tree\r\nis coarse-grained, and so filled with siliceous matter that it soon\r\ndulls the keenest blade, and the grafter will, of necessity, have to\r\nuse his whetstone frequently. In grinding the knife-blade have the\r\nsides a true level, from the back to the edge, especially the\r\nunderside when to be held in the right hand with the edge towards\r\nthe body. The importance of having a blade of this form will soon\r\nbecome apparent when the grafter attempts to make a true sloping cut\r\non either stock or cion, and it would be well for the novice to\r\npractice for an hour or two in splicing some worthless twigs before\r\ncommencing upon more valuable material, for even an expert workman\r\nis very likely to make some awkward dissections and joints when out\r\nof practice. The professional propagator of plants may think such\r\ndetails are unimportant, but I wish to impress upon the amateur that\r\nin grafting nut trees we are dealing with kinds that will not\r\nrespond satisfactorily to such free manipulations as the apple and\r\npear; consequently, better and more careful handling is required to\r\ninsure success.\r\n\r\nWhen ready to begin operations in the field, take out a quantity of\r\nthe shoots to be used for cions, and keep them wrapped in damp cloth\r\nor packed in a box, basket or other receptacle with wet moss, to\r\nprevent drying. If any considerable number of stocks are to be\r\ngrafted, then an assistant or two will be required, for the grafter\r\ncannot be alternately handling the knife and cions and wax, and do\r\ngood work, but if he only inserts the cions and his assistant\r\napplies the waxed ligatures, the operation will proceed more rapidly\r\nand satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. SPLICE GRAFT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. SPLICE GRAFT INSERTED.]\r\n\r\n=Modes of Grafting.=--The only two modes of grafting that I shall\r\nrecommend for the chestnut are the splice or whip graft, and the\r\ncleft or wedge graft. In the splice graft, the cion and stock should\r\nbe of about the same diameter, but if there is any difference let it\r\nbe in favor of the stock, and this the largest. In this mode of\r\ngrafting, the stock is cut off with an upward slope, exposing two or\r\nthree inches of wood; and about midway on this slope a small cleft\r\nor incision is made, forming what is called a \"tongue.\" The cion is\r\nthen cut in the same way from the upper end downward, with a\r\ncorresponding incision, as seen in Fig. 13. Then the two are neatly\r\nfitted together, the tongue on one entering the cleft on the other,\r\nmaking a close joint, as shown in Fig. 14. The bark of the cion and\r\nstock should be exactly even on one side at least; and if they are\r\nof the same size, so much the better, for then they will be even on\r\nboth sides; but we cannot expect to secure such perfect joints on\r\nevery stock, or any considerable number, although we aim to do so as\r\nfrequently as possible. When the cion is fitted, the waxed paper is\r\napplied by placing one end of the strip at or near the base of the\r\nsplice, then wind it spirally and firmly upward until the entire\r\nwound is covered. If one of the waxed strips is not enough use\r\nanother, for it will do no harm if they are double on a part or all\r\nover the joint. The cion should not be much over four inches long,\r\nand a less length is preferable, but not so convenient for handling.\r\nOne good prominent bud on each cion is sufficient, and this left\r\nnear the upper end, but on short-jointed wood we may use cions with\r\ntwo or more buds without greatly increasing their length. After the\r\ncion is in place and every part of the splice is carefully sealed\r\nwith the waxed paper, place a small piece or a little wax on the\r\nupper end of the cion, just enough to cover the exposed wound and\r\nprevent evaporation of the natural moisture or sap in the wood. I\r\nhave found, in practice, that this sealing the end of the cion is\r\ntime well spent; in fact, to leave any of the wood cells exposed to\r\nthe air endangers the success of the operation.\r\n\r\nYoung shoots from a quarter of an inch in diameter up to\r\nfive-eighths may be used for cions, in splice grafting; and with a\r\nlittle care in the selection of stocks, or by cutting them off a few\r\ninches higher or lower, we may readily manage to have them nearly of\r\nthe same diameter to match our cions, whether they are large or\r\nsmall, and such unions will soon heal over, leaving no scar at the\r\npoint where the two have been joined.\r\n\r\nIf the new growth or shoot to be employed as a cion is slender and\r\nfeeble, then the base of the cion may be of two-year-old wood,\r\nleaving just a bud or two on the upper end of the one-year shoot.\r\nBut it will seldom be necessary to employ such cions in grafting the\r\nchestnut, although it may occur when seeking to secure wood for\r\npropagation, from very old trees which have made only a feeble\r\nannual growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. STOCK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. CION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\n=Cleft Grafting.=--This method is employed principally upon stocks\r\nor branches of trees too large for splicing. The stock is first cut\r\noff at the point where it is desirable to insert the cion; then\r\nsplit with a knife, being careful to divide it, so that the edges\r\nwill be kept smooth, and not rough and ragged (Fig. 15). When the\r\nknife blade is withdrawn, the cleft may be kept open with a hard\r\nwood wedge, if the stock is too large to admit of opening it with\r\nthe point of the knife when ready to insert the cion. The cion may\r\nbe three or four inches long, containing two or more buds; the lower\r\nend is cut wedge-shape, as shown in Fig. 16, and slightly the\r\nthickest on the side to be set against the bark of the stock. In\r\nstocks of an inch or more in diameter, two cions, one on each side,\r\nmay be inserted (Fig. 17), and if both grow one should be cut away,\r\nelse the tree, in later years, will be very likely to divide or\r\nbreak apart at this point. In stocks of an inch or less in diameter,\r\none cion is sufficient, the top of the stock to be cut off with an\r\nupward slope, as shown in Fig. 18. After the cions are inserted, the\r\nentire exposed surface of the wood must be covered with grafting wax\r\nor waxed paper, and usually both may be employed with benefit. All\r\nthe various forms of grafting in the open air, as described in my\r\nwork on the \"Propagation of Plants,\" may be employed on the\r\nchestnut, but the two here given will probably answer just as well\r\nas others for those who may have occasion to propagate this tree.\r\n\r\n=Success in Grafting.=--The question has been asked many times, and\r\nwill, no doubt, be frequently repeated, \"What percentage of cions\r\nshould one accustomed to grafting make grow?\" As there are no\r\nstatistics upon which to base an answer to the question, I can only\r\ngive my own personal experience, and this leads me to say that\r\nseventy-five per cent may be considered an excellent, if not a high\r\naverage. In some seasons this has been exceeded by at least ten per\r\ncent, while in others it has fallen as much or more below, with no\r\napparent reason for the difference. Ninety-five per cent of the\r\ncions may push their buds, or even make a growth of several inches,\r\nthen begin to die off; consequently, the time to count your\r\nsuccessfully grafted trees is in the autumn, and not in spring or\r\nmidsummer, as it is to be feared some are in the habit of doing when\r\nmaking a report upon what they call success in grafting nut trees.\r\n\r\n=Growth of Cions.=--Cions set in strong stocks usually make a very\r\nrapid and vigorous growth, and if left unchecked, there is danger of\r\nloss by being broken or blown off by strong winds during the summer\r\nand autumn. To prevent this as much as possible, it has been my\r\npractice to pinch off the ends of the young shoots when they are\r\nabout two feet long. Lateral shoots will then push out freely, and\r\nin some seasons it may be necessary to check their growth in the\r\nsame way later. On feeble stocks, or those quite small, and with the\r\nless vigorous growing varieties, no summer pinching or pruning will\r\nbe required. My experimental grounds are well protected upon the\r\nnorth and west, not only by rising ground, but by Norway spruce and\r\nAmerican arbor vitae hedges twice as high as the grafted chestnut\r\ntrees in the nursery rows, and yet almost every season some of the\r\nstronger-growing grafts are blown out or broken off by the wind.\r\nAfter the first season there is little danger of injury, probably\r\nbecause the union between cion and stock has become stronger.\r\n\r\n=Grafting Chestnut Sprouts.=--In grafting the vigorous sprouts that\r\nalways spring up from the stumps of old trees that have been\r\nrecently cut down, we may reasonably expect a prodigious growth of\r\nthe cion the first season, as well as in succeeding ones, and if all\r\ngoes well with them we will secure large bearing trees in a very few\r\nyears, but such stocks are only available where old trees are\r\nsacrificed for their timber or other purposes. Having a few such\r\nsprouts on my place, they have been utilized from time to time in\r\ntesting some of the newer varieties. In one instance I allowed the\r\ncion, set on a sprout about one inch in diameter, six feet from the\r\nbase, to grow unchecked throughout the season, as it was in a\r\nprotected position, and in the fall the entire length of the main\r\nstem and lateral branches was sixty-five feet, and all from one bud\r\non a cion set early in the spring. The third year this tree bore\r\nabout a peck of very large nuts, to which I shall have occasion to\r\nrefer again under \"Injurious Insects.\"\r\n\r\n=Grafting Large Trees.=--Grafting large chestnut trees with stems of\r\nsix inches or more in diameter, and with large spreading heads, is\r\npossible, but far from being economical or practicable, especially\r\nif the trees stand out where they will get the full sweep of\r\nprevailing winds. By cutting off and grafting a few of the branches\r\nat a time for several seasons in succession, one may, in a few\r\nyears, succeed in getting the entire head grafted, but there is\r\nconstant danger of some of the cions being broken out if they make a\r\nvigorous growth, leaving a distorted and ill-shapen tree. Having\r\nexperimented somewhat in this line with variable success, I am not\r\ninclined to recommend it, because ten trees can be raised to a\r\nbearing age on moderate-sized stocks with less labor, and the\r\nresults will be more satisfactory.\r\n\r\n=Budding Chestnuts.=--I have frequently tried budding chestnut\r\nstocks as described for the almond, and extensively employed with\r\nother kinds of fruit trees. But the results of my experiments have\r\nbeen unsatisfactory, although buds were set from very early in\r\nsummer until late in the fall, also on young and old wood; but so\r\nfew have taken and remained alive over winter that my personal\r\nexperience in this mode of propagation will not justify its\r\nrecommendation to others. Perhaps there is some secret connected\r\nwith the operation that I have not yet discovered, but which is\r\nknown to other propagators. Of course, budding with semi-dormant\r\nwood and buds in spring, as soon as the bark will peel from the\r\nwood, is practicable, but there is really nothing to be gained by\r\nthis mode of propagation over that of grafting.\r\n\r\n=Transplanting and Pruning.=--There is no tree that will bear or\r\nwithstand more severe pruning than the chestnut. If trees of one or\r\nfive hundred years of age are cut down, the stumps are sure to throw\r\nup an immense number of sprouts from adventitious buds, as these are\r\nreadily produced at almost any point on the sapwood or alburnum\r\nunder the bark; and yet, with this inherent vitality and faculty of\r\nrecuperation, the chestnut tree does not naturally, like many other\r\ndeciduous kinds, throw up suckers from the roots. Keeping this\r\npeculiarity in mind, the cultivator has only to use his pruning\r\nknife freely upon the trees to secure almost any form desired. But\r\nafter the trees have become well established, very little pruning\r\nwill be required, except to occasionally thin out or remove a\r\nrambling branch, to secure a well-balanced and shapely head to the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nIn transplanting from the nursery rows, after grafting, and\r\nespecially if the trees are of some considerable size and large\r\nenough to set where they are to remain permanently, there is sure to\r\nbe a loss of roots, and those that are preserved are likely to\r\nremain for a short time inactive and incapable of absorbing\r\nnutrients from the soil to which they are transferred, or until new\r\nrootlets are produced. Under these conditions we aim to favor the\r\nroots by removing or cutting back the greater part of the branches.\r\nNo matter how carefully such trees are lifted and their roots\r\nprotected during the operation of transplanting, it will check the\r\ngrowth, and the best and most practical restorative is severe\r\npruning of the top, and every young shoot of the previous season's\r\ngrowth should be cut back to within three or four inches of its\r\nbase. I am presuming that the trees have been grafted only one year,\r\nbut if older, and the cions were set high enough to begin the\r\nformation of the head of the tree, then the entire young growth may\r\nbe cut away and some of the older wood, but of course not below the\r\ngraft. All broken roots must be cut off; and the ends of the larger\r\nones, roughly severed with the spade or other implements employed in\r\ndigging, should have their wounds smoothed with a sharp knife.\r\n\r\nFrequent transplanting and root-pruning young nursery stock tends to\r\nkeep up a proper root system, and an abundance of small fibrous\r\nroots near the main stem, and trees so treated are worth much more,\r\nif to be transplanted later, than those left undisturbed; but while\r\nthe latter may be twice the size of the former when of the same age,\r\nthey are not worth half as much to the purchaser, or for\r\ntransplanting in our own grounds.\r\n\r\n=Staking Transplanted Trees.=--This is always necessary for recently\r\nplanted trees, if they are of any considerable size, or from six\r\nfeet high and upwards. If not supported by stakes they are sure to\r\nbe swayed about, if not thrown over, by strong winds in summer. A\r\nstrong stake, two or three inches in diameter, would better be set\r\nat the time of planting the tree, thereby avoiding breaking off or\r\ncrushing the roots, as frequently happens when stakes are driven\r\ndown among them later in the season. Set the stakes or drive into\r\nthe subsoil six inches from the stem, then use strips of cloth,\r\nsacks, carpet, or some similar material, for tying, because hard\r\ncord or twine will be very likely to cut through the tender bark\r\nfrom the constant swaying about of the stems. Wind the strips around\r\nthe stem, and then cross between it and the stake once or twice, to\r\nprevent the tree from pressing against or coming in contact with the\r\nstake. Renew the stakes and tying materials, if necessary, until the\r\ntrees become firmly established, and provided with lateral roots\r\nlarge enough to keep them in an upright position.\r\n\r\n=Mulching.=--Placing a few forkfuls of coarse stable manure,\r\nhalf-rotted straw, leaves, or any similar material, on the surface\r\nabout the stems of recently planted trees, will prove very\r\nbeneficial, in not only keeping down the weeds, but aiding greatly\r\nin retaining moisture in the soil about the roots. The application\r\nof some such material as a mulch is all the more important with the\r\nchestnut, because these trees are always to be planted in a\r\nnaturally dry and well drained soil.\r\n\r\n=Distance Between Trees.=--How far apart chestnut trees should be\r\nplanted will depend very much upon the species and varieties, some\r\ngrowing to immense trees, while others are only fair-sized shrubs at\r\nmaturity. But for the larger-growing varieties, forty to fifty feet\r\nbetween the trees is none too much space, when planted for their\r\nnuts and not for timber. If set in a single row along the public\r\nhighways, farm lanes or around the outbuildings, to serve as shade\r\nor ornament, and for their nuts, then about forty feet will answer\r\nvery well for the larger-growing species; and I will add that, in my\r\nopinion, all the larger kinds of nut trees will give better returns\r\nif placed in such positions, than when set in orchards or in compact\r\nmasses. When set in single rows or widely scattered, they are less\r\nliable to be attacked by insects and diseases, while they will still\r\nserve the double purpose of being both ornamental and useful. I must\r\nadmit, however, that in my experimental grounds the trees are\r\nplanted only twenty feet apart, but with the expectation of soon\r\ncutting out every alternate specimen.\r\n\r\n=Soil and Climate.=--The chestnut thrives best in light,\r\nwell-drained soils, and those containing a large proportion of sand\r\nor decomposed quartz, slate, or volcanic scoria; but it is rarely\r\nfound, nor does it succeed, in heavy clays, limestone soils, or on\r\nthe rich western prairies, where we might think it would grow most\r\nluxuriantly. That limestone soils are inimical to the chestnut has\r\noften been disputed, but my own observations, which have been\r\nsomewhat extensive in years and range of country, rather confirm the\r\nimpression that this tree avoids land containing any considerable\r\npercentage of lime. It is true that chestnut groves, and sometimes\r\nextensive forests, are found on hills and ridges overlying\r\nlimestone, but a careful examination of the soil among the trees\r\nwill show that it is a drift deposit containing little or no lime.\r\nSuch groves can be found in all the southern tier of counties of New\r\nYork, also among the hills of northern and western parts of New\r\nJersey, and thence west and south along the Blue Ridge and Alleghany\r\nmountains to the Carolinas, and westward in Tennessee and Kentucky.\r\nThe chestnut is sometimes found in New Jersey and other northern\r\nAtlantic States growing in considerable abundance near streams only\r\na few feet above sea level, but when found in such situations the\r\nsubsoil is invariably sand, gravel or porous shale.\r\n\r\nThe range of climate in which the native sweet chestnut thrives is\r\nquite extensive, as it is found sparingly in Maine in latitude 44 deg.,\r\nextending westward,--but not very abundant on this line,--through\r\nNew England and New York, crossing the Niagara river, skirting the\r\nnorth shore of Lake Erie in Canada, and thence into southern\r\nMichigan, but does not reach Illinois. From this line southward it\r\nincreases in abundance in Virginia, western North Carolina and\r\neastern Tennessee and Kentucky. But in following this tree southward\r\nwe meet another indigenous species, widely known as the chinquapin\r\n(_Castanea pumila_). This species is indigenous to southern New\r\nJersey, and sparingly in parts of Pennsylvania, becoming more\r\nplentiful as we proceed southward, the two species named overlapping\r\nand in part occupying the same region; but the chinquapin extends\r\nfurther south, and also to the westward, near its northern limits\r\ncrossing the Mississippi into southern Missouri, then extends south\r\nagain, becoming quite abundant in Arkansas.\r\n\r\nThe European chestnut, in its many varieties, extends over about the\r\nsame number of degrees of latitude in Europe as our species do here,\r\nalthough reaching a higher latitude in countries bordering on the\r\nAtlantic, as shown in the old chestnut trees of England. The\r\nOriental chestnut has also a very wide range, but the limits are not\r\nso well known as those of the European and American species; but a\r\nstudy of its geographical distribution is of considerable\r\nimportance, now that we are importing these nuts for cultivation.\r\nThe same is also true of the European varieties, and the cultivator\r\nwho neglects to take this matter into consideration will fail to\r\nsecure whatever advantages may have accrued from acclimation, an\r\nagency which, undoubtedly, has been active and continuous in\r\nmodifying and changing the primary characteristics of these plants\r\nduring unknown ages.\r\n\r\nTo more fully impress upon the reader the importance of care in the\r\nselection of materials to be employed in any pursuit with which he\r\nis not perfectly familiar, I am prompted to relate the story of my\r\nfirst personal experience in chestnut culture, as it may serve as a\r\nwarning to others who may attempt to raise these nuts in a cold\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nAt the time of purchasing the farm which has been my home for the\r\npast thirty years, nut trees of various kinds were on my list of\r\nthings wanted, and the chestnut occupied a leading position,\r\nprobably because there were already many old and large native trees\r\non the place. My first planting consisted of a number of imported\r\nseedlings, obtained from a well-known French nursery. The trees were\r\nthree or four years old, very stocky and vigorous, and they made a\r\ngood growth the first season; but the following winter the young\r\nshoots were all frozen down to old wood, with the exception of one\r\ntree, and thinking that this might prove hardy, cions were taken\r\nfrom it and set in thrifty sprouts growing in a grove near by. The\r\ncions made rapid growth, and from one of these I soon had a large\r\ntree, which remained in good health for twenty years, but during all\r\nthat time it produced but one bur, containing two half-developed\r\nnuts. Why it was unfruitful I do not pretend to know, but it was\r\ncertainly not for want of company, for it had large native chestnut\r\ntrees all about it, and these bearing heavy crops. The seedling\r\ntrees planted in the orchard also failed to be fruitful, and were\r\nfinally dug up and burned. Thus ended my first experiment in the\r\ncultivation of the European chestnut. Had my location been farther\r\nsouth and in a milder climate, the experiment might have ended\r\ndifferently, but I am relating experience, and not attempting to\r\nguess what might have been the results under more favorable\r\nconditions. In the meantime, however, I had seen a few trees of the\r\nJapan chestnut bearing on Long Island, and had received specimens of\r\nthe Numbo and Paragon, two now well-known and superior varieties of\r\nthe European species, although raised in this country. These\r\nvarieties were secured, and succeeded so well that I have continued\r\nto add others from time to time, or as soon as trees or cions were\r\nobtainable.\r\n\r\nThe success which appears to have attended the propagation and\r\ndissemination of these two varieties of European parentage has\r\nawakened considerable interest in chestnut culture, besides\r\nattracting the attention of those interested in such matters to the\r\nfact that there are many old trees of the same or similar origin\r\nscattered about the country, awaiting the coming nut culturist to\r\npropagate them and make known their merits.\r\n\r\nIt may be well, before leaving this subject, to remind the novice in\r\nchestnut culture that seedlings of these hardy and productive\r\ndescendants of the European species will not come true from the nut\r\nor seed, and while it will be admitted that the chances are somewhat\r\nbetter for procuring a hardy variety from such nuts than from those\r\nimported, still, there is no certainty of any considerable number\r\nbeing equal in hardiness or other respects to the parent tree. There\r\nis an inherent tendency, in tree seedlings of all kinds, to revert\r\nto the wild form or type, and the chestnut is no exception to this\r\nrule.\r\n\r\n=Species of Chestnut.=--What is called a \"species,\" among plants, is\r\na particular form or type supposed to have descended from one\r\noriginal stock, whether this was composed of one or more\r\nindividuals. But variations doubtless occurred at the first\r\ninception or multiplication of the original, but so long as the\r\noffsprings do not differ so widely as to be untraceable to the\r\nproemial types, they are held to be varieties of one species.\r\n\r\nWhether all the chestnuts found in the various countries of the\r\nworld are descendants of one original tree or group of trees is now\r\nbeyond our ability to determine; consequently, what are now termed\r\nspecies rests very much upon the opinions of botanists, as may\r\nreadily be demonstrated by consulting the works of hundreds of\r\nauthors who have essayed to describe and classify the plants of any\r\nlocality or country, and this, too, without reaching an absolute\r\nfinality acceptable to their contemporaries, or at all likely to\r\nshare a better fate with posterity.\r\n\r\nFor many years after botany began to be recognized as a science, the\r\ncommon American sweet chestnut was considered a distinct species,\r\nbut in recent years it has been relegated to the position of a\r\nwidely distributed variety of the European chestnut, and it is so\r\ndescribed and classified in most of the botanical works of the\r\npresent time, and under such names as _Castanea vesca_, variety\r\n_Americana_; _Castanea sativa_, variety _Americana_; _Castanea\r\nvulgaris_, variety _Americana_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic species or varieties--under whichever cognomen we may\r\nfind them described in botanical works--have fared little better\r\nthan our American kinds, for some botanists have described the Japan\r\nchestnut as a distinct species, while others only as a widely\r\ndivergent variety of the common European chestnut.\r\n\r\nI regret that there should be any need of giving so much space to\r\nthis matter of species and varieties, yet presuming that far the\r\nlarger number of my readers will not be professional botanists, nor\r\npersons with a botanical library at hand to consult for unfamiliar\r\nterms, I have thought this explanation in regard to classification\r\nmight assist them in making clear the apparent confusion of names\r\nwhich, in the main, are only synonyms. Furthermore, I purpose\r\nretaining some of the older specific names of the distinct groups of\r\nvarieties, whether it be strictly in accord with the ideas of\r\neminent authorities or otherwise, because it will be more convenient\r\nto do so, and certain phases will thus be made clearer to the\r\npractical cultivators of nut trees, for whom this work is written.\r\nMy wish is to assist those who do not know, but want to learn how to\r\nobtain, plant and make nut trees grow and bear remunerative crops.\r\n\r\nCASTANEA AMERICANA (_American sweet chestnut_).--Leaves\r\noblong-lanceolate, serrate, with rather coarse teeth, each\r\nterminated with a feeble prickle or spine; smooth on both sides\r\n(Fig. 19). Burs thickly covered with sharp, branching spines a half\r\ninch long or less, from a fleshy green envelope, becoming hard and\r\nsomewhat woody; opening by four valves or divisions when mature.\r\nUsually three nuts in each bur, the center one flattened by\r\ncompression, the two outer ones plano-convex. Shell tough and\r\nleathery, dark brown, smooth, or more or less inverted, with a\r\nsilvery pubescence from the point downward; variable in size from\r\nfive-eighths to an inch in diameter. Kernel sweet and fine-grained.\r\nA very large and common tree in the Middle and Northern States,\r\nliving to a great age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. AMERICAN CHESTNUT LEAF.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. SPIKE OF BURS OF BUSH CHINQUAPIN. _C.\r\nnana._]\r\n\r\nCASTANEA NANA (_bush chinquapin_).--Leaves oval-lanceolate, serrate,\r\nwith feeble prickles on teeth and often wanting; pale green above\r\nand white tomentose underneath. Burs in racemes, small; husk thin,\r\nopening by two divisions or lobes, instead of four, as in the last\r\nspecies; spines short, somewhat scattering, sessile or very\r\nshort-stalked; nuts small, pointed, brown, smooth, thin-shelled,\r\nsolitary or only one in a bur. Kernel fine-grained, sweet and\r\ndelicious. Common from North Carolina southward to Florida, in dry\r\nsoils and barrens. A medium-sized shrub or low-spreading bush,\r\nrarely reaching a hight of ten feet, the slender twigs usually\r\ntomentose. A spike of burs and leaves of this species are seen in\r\nFig. 20.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. SPIKE OF CHINQUAPIN CHESTNUT BUR. _C.\r\npumila._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. SINGLE BUR, NUT AND LEAF OF CHINQUAPIN\r\nCHESTNUT. _C. pumila._]\r\n\r\nCASTANEA PUMILA (_chinquapin chestnut_).--Leaves oblong-lanceolate,\r\nshort or acutely pointed, coarsely serrate, with incurved pointed\r\nteeth, green above, tomentose underneath. Burs in racemes (Fig. 21),\r\ntwo-valved. Sometimes the burs are single, as shown in Fig. 22.\r\nSpines branching from a short stalk; nuts solitary, ovoid, pointed,\r\nwith dark-brown polished shell. Kernel fine-grained, sweet and\r\nexcellent. A medium-sized tree twenty to forty feet high; in rich\r\nsoils from New Jersey, Southern Pennsylvania and southward, to\r\nGeorgia, and sparingly westward to Arkansas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. JAPAN CHESTNUT LEAF.]\r\n\r\nCASTANEA SATIVA OR VESCA (_European chestnut_).--Leaves\r\noblong-lanceolate, pointed, coarsely serrate, with rather long\r\nincurved spines on the teeth; smooth on both sides, but glossy and\r\ndark green above; thicker and of more substance than in any other\r\nspecies. Burs very large, with thick husk, and long, stout,\r\nbranching spines, from a woody stem at the base; shell of nut thick,\r\ntough and leathery, of a dark mahogany brown; kernel enclosed in a\r\nrather tough but thin skin that is usually intensely bitter, a\r\ncharacteristic that readily distinguishes this from any of our\r\nspecies. Trees of large size, rather stocky; young shoots coarse,\r\nwith smooth bark; buds prominent, glossy, and of a light\r\nyellowish-brown color.\r\n\r\nCASTANEA JAPONICA (_Japan chestnut_).--Leaves lanceolate-oblong\r\n(Fig. 23), finely serrate, indentations shallow, and the teeth\r\nslender pointed; pale green above and silvery or rusty white\r\nunderneath. Burs with a very thin husk; spines short, widely\r\nbranching from a short stem. Nuts large to very large, usually three\r\nin a bur; shell thin, and of a light brown color; the inner skin\r\nthin, fibrous, but not as bitter as in the European varieties, and\r\nthe kernel somewhat finer grained and sweeter. Trees of moderate\r\ngrowth and are said to rarely exceed fifty feet high in Japan. The\r\ngrowth is slender in comparison with the European or American\r\nchestnut, and the habit is decidedly bushy, the new growth of the\r\nseason usually producing a number of lateral twigs late in summer.\r\nThe leaves here seem to be more persistent, probably because the\r\nseason is not long enough to insure thorough ripening.\r\n\r\nThe reader will please bear in mind that this description of the\r\nJapan chestnut is drawn from the introduced varieties or those\r\nraised from the imported nuts, and not from the trees growing in\r\ntheir native habitats. All the varieties that I have seen appear to\r\nbelong to one type or species, and they come from the warmer parts\r\nof that country; but Prof. Sargent, in his \"Forest Flora of Japan,\"\r\nsays that while the largest nuts appear in the markets of Kobe and\r\nOsaka, from whence they come to this country, there are varieties\r\noffered for sale in the markets of Aomori, which is much further\r\nnorth, and these, he thinks, would produce a more hardy race of\r\nvarieties than those we have already received from that country. As\r\na race, all the Japan chestnuts are very precocious, the trees\r\ncoming into bearing early whether raised from the nut or propagated\r\nby grafting.\r\n\r\n=Native Varieties.= (Group One).--While it is well known that our\r\nAmerican sweet chestnut varies widely in the size, flavor, form,\r\ncolor and general appearance of the nuts, no special effort has been\r\nmade to select and perpetuate the most distinct and valuable\r\nvarieties. This is to be regretted, inasmuch as the opportunities\r\nfor making such selections, and preserving and propagating those\r\nmost worthy of it, are rapidly passing away with the destruction of\r\nour chestnut forests; but there is still time to do something in\r\nthis direction, and perhaps save a few varieties as valuable as\r\nthose already destroyed. It is to be hoped that every man who knows\r\nof a large variety, will either propagate it himself, or point it\r\nout to some one who is sufficiently interested to do so. If proper\r\nattention was given to the raising of seedlings, we might soon\r\nsecure many improved native varieties, and I would urge this mode of\r\npropagation upon all whose circumstances and surroundings will admit\r\nof it, and especially upon the young men who possess the talent and\r\ninclination to make such experiments; for there is a wide and\r\nfertile field open to them, and they can scarcely fail to reap a\r\nrich reward for their labors, if applied with earnestness and a\r\nmoderate amount of intelligence.\r\n\r\nBURLESS CHESTNUT.--This is a peculiar variety or freak, in which the\r\nburs are merely shallow cups upon which the nuts rest, and at no\r\nstage of their growth are they enclosed in a husk or bur. The nuts\r\nare small and usually perfect, but being unprotected they are preyed\r\nupon by birds and squirrels as soon as the kernels are well formed,\r\nfew escaping to reach maturity. This chestnut is of no economic\r\nvalue, but is worth preserving as an illustration of extremes in\r\nvariation. The original tree was found in the forest near Freehold,\r\nGreen Co., N. Y., by Mr. Harry Bagley, to whom I am indebted for\r\ncions sent me in the spring of 1885. Another and very similar\r\nvariety was found about the same time on Staten Island, N. Y., and\r\nthis also has been propagated, to a limited extent, as a curiosity.\r\n\r\nHATHAWAY.--A very large and handsome native variety, and one of the\r\nvery best. A strong and vigorous grower, and productive. Raised by\r\nMr. B. Hathaway, the veteran and widely known pomologist of Little\r\nPrairie Ronde, Mich. Some thirty years ago Mr. Hathaway purchased a\r\nhalf bushel of native chestnuts of a dealer in Ohio, and from these\r\nraised a large number of trees for sale; but a few were reserved for\r\nplanting out on his own grounds, and when these came into bearing\r\nthe one named here was selected for propagation, because of its\r\nlarge size and productiveness.\r\n\r\nPHILLIPS.--A large and handsome variety of excellent flavor, with a\r\nvery smooth, dark-brown shell. Grafted trees exceedingly vigorous,\r\nupright growth, as well as precocious and productive. The original\r\ntree is growing in the grounds of the late Whitman Phillips, at\r\nRidgewood, N. J. Several years ago my attention was called to a\r\nnumber of large varieties of the chestnut growing in and near the\r\nvillage, and from these I obtained cions for propagation; but I name\r\nonly one at this time, reserving the others until more fully tested.\r\n\r\nThis is rather an insignificant number of varieties to be named\r\namong the many hundreds that are to be found in almost every town or\r\nneighborhood where the chestnut is a native, and yet I have been\r\nable to find only one named in nurserymen's catalogues as being\r\npropagated by grafting. It is true that nearly all dealers in trees\r\noffer seedling American chestnuts, which may mean good, bad or\r\nindifferent varieties when the trees come into bearing. Among all of\r\nthe many thousands that have been raised and planted in the East and\r\nWest, beyond the natural range of the chestnut, as, for instance, in\r\nMissouri, Kansas and Iowa, there must be some distinct and valuable\r\nvarieties worthy of names and propagation. There are not only\r\ndistinct varieties to be found in every forest, but in some\r\ninstances the entire product of an extended area of country are\r\ndistinct in their color, size, and general appearance of the nuts\r\nproduced; as, for instance, in the woolly chestnuts of the Piedmont\r\ndistrict of Virginia, these being so nearly covered with a white\r\ndown that they remind one of popcorn. Hundreds of bushels of these\r\nwoolly chestnuts come to our markets, and among them I have often\r\nfound very large specimens, but so far as known, no effort has been\r\nmade to perpetuate them.\r\n\r\nSo far as can now be determined, the wild or original European\r\nchestnut was much inferior in its flavor, and little, if any, larger\r\nthan our American sweet chestnut; but by continued selections of the\r\nlargest for planting, and propagation by grafting, it has attained\r\nto its present size and excellence; but this system of improving our\r\nnative varieties has scarcely, as yet, been attempted, a fact which\r\ndoes not, in the least, redound to our credit.\r\n\r\nBUSH CHINQUAPIN (_C. nana._ Muhlenberg).--Of this I do not know of\r\nany named varieties in cultivation. Plants are occasionally seen in\r\ncultivated grounds, and I have one in my garden growing in a\r\nsheltered position, where it has fruited for several years. It is a\r\npretty, round-headed, silvery-leaved bush, about six feet high;\r\nornamental, if not specially valuable for other purposes, although\r\nthe little sweet nuts are always acceptable. As a rule, the\r\nseedlings of this species are not hardy in the Northern States, but\r\nan occasional one will survive if planted in a light, porous soil\r\nand a protected situation.\r\n\r\nCOMMON CHINQUAPIN (_C. pumila._ Miller).--This is a small tree,\r\nsometimes thirty to forty feet high; found sparingly as far north as\r\ncentral New Jersey, and on Long Island. It is more common in\r\ncultivation than the bush chinquapin, probably because more hardy\r\nand better known, but I do not know of any improved varieties that\r\nhave been disseminated under distinct names except the one\r\nhereinafter described.\r\n\r\nAmong many seedlings raised, of this species, I have selected one\r\nwhich good judges of such things have thought worthy of propagation,\r\nand as I do not raise plants for sale, no one will be likely to\r\naccuse me of having any selfish motives, further than a pardonable\r\npride in producing something worthy of perpetuation. Furthermore, as\r\nan earnest of my confidence in its merits, I have distributed it\r\nunder my own name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. BURS OF FULLER'S CHINQUAPIN. ONE-HALF\r\nNATURAL SIZE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25. FULLER'S CHINQUAPIN. FIVE YEARS OLD FROM\r\nNUT.]\r\n\r\nFULLER'S CHINQUAPIN.--Leaves large, broadly oval, pointed, coarsely\r\nserrate, pale green above, clear silvery white below. Bark on main\r\nstem; branches and twigs smooth, light gray, with numerous white\r\ndots. The young twigs thick and stocky, cylindrical, with moderately\r\nprominent, grayish buds. Burs in long racemes (Fig. 24), very large\r\nfor this species; spines long, strong, branching and sharp. Nuts\r\nonly one in each bur, rather short, broad, top-shaped, with blunt\r\npoint; shell very smooth, glossy, almost black; kernel fine-grained\r\nand sweet. Ripens early, or with the earliest of the native sweet\r\nchestnuts. The original tree is only six years old, twice\r\ntransplanted, and is now ten feet high, with a head fully as broad,\r\nand as shown in Fig. 25. Although growing in a rather exposed\r\nposition, it has never been injured by low temperature in winter or\r\na high one in summer. It has thus far been the most rapid-growing\r\nchestnut tree in my grounds, although given no special care. Whether\r\nit will eventually become a large tree, or soon cease to extend, is,\r\nof course, a question to be answered at some future time, but from\r\npresent indications this tree will be well worthy of cultivation as\r\nan ornamental shade tree, even if we leave out of the account its\r\nrapid growth, productiveness, and delicious little nuts, which will\r\nbe very acceptable for home use, if not possessing any great\r\ncommercial value.\r\n\r\n=European Varieties.=--In the use of this term I wish it understood\r\nthat the varieties named and described in this group are all of\r\nAmerican origin; that is, raised in this country from seed. At the\r\nsame time they are descendants of the European species. They are, in\r\nother words, \"Survivals of the fittests,\" the few that have survived\r\nthe many being raised from imported nuts (perhaps one out of a\r\nthousand) that tests and time have shown were adapted to our\r\nclimate. There may be many other varieties scattered about the\r\ncountry which are worthy of a name and of propagation, but I can\r\nspeak only of those I have been able to procure, or that have been\r\nbrought to my notice.\r\n\r\nIn describing the following varieties, and in seeking to get at the\r\nfacts relating to their origin, name and history, the reader will\r\nplease bear in mind that there has been no previous attempt to\r\narrange or classify these semi-American varieties. Furthermore,\r\nthere is much confusion in regard to the true names of a number of\r\nthem, and the most I can say is that I have endeavored, under the\r\ncircumstances, to get as near the truth as possible. Could I defer\r\nwriting this chapter ten years, some moot points might be cleared\r\nup, but as this is out of the question I must follow the light\r\nalready in my possession.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. John R. Parry, of Parry, N. J., I am greatly indebted, not\r\nonly for specimens of new and rare varieties, but also notes\r\nrelating to the history of several of the older ones.\r\n\r\nCOMFORT.--Burs very large, broad, somewhat flattened; spines very\r\nstrong and long, branching; nuts very broad, with short point, and\r\nshell covered from base to point with scattering silky hairs,\r\nthicker at upper end. In quality, about the same as in the ordinary\r\nvarieties of the species, but to some persons' taste it is better,\r\nhaving less astringency in the skin surrounding the kernel. Origin\r\nuncertain, but said to have been grown for many years at Germantown,\r\na suburb of Philadelphia, Pa., where the Paragon chestnut was\r\ndiscovered. The Comfort certainly closely resembles the Paragon, but\r\nI have not had an opportunity of fruiting trees under the two names\r\nside by side, as would be necessary to determine their identity or\r\ndifference, if they are really distinct.\r\n\r\nCOOPER.--A very large variety; has been in cultivation for several\r\nyears in Camden Co., N. J., but up to the present time the trees\r\nhave not been propagated for sale, although I am informed by Mr.\r\nJohn R. Parry that there are a large number under cultivation. The\r\ntree is described as of a broad spreading habit, with enormously\r\nlarge leaves, and immensely productive. Nuts very large, smooth and\r\nglossy, with little fuzz near the top. In quality they may be\r\nconsidered excellent for a variety of this class. The burs are very\r\nlarge, and this is its greatest or only fault; for when nearly\r\nmature they absorb and retain such a quantity of water during heavy\r\nrains, in addition to the original weight and the enclosed nuts,\r\nthat the trees are liable to be broken down by strong winds.\r\n\r\nCORSON.--Burs of immense size; spines an inch or more in length,\r\nfrom a stout, woody, irregularly branching stem, resting on the\r\nmoderately thin husk. Nuts extra large, usually three in a bur;\r\nshell dark brown, somewhat ridged; the upper end or point of the\r\nshell densely covered with a white, almost woolly, pubescence, or\r\nfuzz as it is usually termed. This is a remarkably large and fine\r\nvariety and of good quality. Originated with Mr. Walter H. Corson,\r\nPlymouth Meeting, Montgomery Co., Pa.\r\n\r\nDAGER.--A large variety originated near Wyoming, Delaware, from seed\r\nof the Ridgely. My specimen trees are good vigorous growers, and\r\nhardy, but have not, as yet, produced fruit. It is said that the\r\nnuts are of fair quality, but not as good as the best of its class.\r\n\r\nMONCUR.--Another seedling of the Ridgely, raised on the farm of Mr.\r\nFrank Moncur, near Dover, Del. The original tree is about thirty\r\nyears old. Described as smaller than its parent, but of better\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26. BUR OF NUMBO CHESTNUT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. SPINES OF NUMBO CHESTNUT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. NUMBO CHESTNUT.]\r\n\r\nNUMBO.--Burs medium, and distinctly long pointed before opening, as\r\nshown in Fig. 26, the four divisions of the burs extending an inch\r\nor more beyond the nut as they open. This is an exceptional form of\r\nthe bur, and will enable almost any person to recognize the variety\r\nwith bearing trees. Spines only medium in length (Fig. 27), and not\r\nas strong as in most other varieties of this species. Nuts very\r\nlarge (Fig. 28), smooth, decidedly pointed, light brown when first\r\nmature, and of good flavor. Tree hardy and a vigorous, free grower,\r\nand is very productive even when young. The original tree is now\r\nsome forty years old, and is one of a large number raised from\r\nimported nuts, by the late Mahlon Moon, of Morrisville, Pa.\r\n\r\nMILLER'S DUPONT.--Burs large, spines long and strong but not as\r\nstout as in some of the closely related varieties. Nut medium, and\r\nkernel of fair quality. A promising variety. Origin unknown.\r\nReceived from Jos. Evans, Delaware Co., Pa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29. PARAGON CHESTNUT BUR. (_One-half natural\r\nsize._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. SPINES OF PARAGON CHESTNUT BUR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31. PARAGON CHESTNUT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32. FOUR YEAR OLD PARAGON CHESTNUT TREE.]\r\n\r\nPARAGON.--Burs of immense size, often five inches and more in\r\nlateral diameter; distinctly flattened on the top, or cushion shape\r\n(Fig. 29); spines an inch in length, widely and irregularly\r\nbranching from a stout stem springing from a thick, fleshy husk, as\r\nshown in Fig. 30, the whole making an involucre or bur out of\r\nproportion to the nuts within. Nuts of large size, slightly\r\ndepressed at the top (Fig. 31), and they are usually broader than\r\nlong; shell very dark brown, slightly ridged, and covered with a\r\nfine but not very conspicuous pubescence. Kernel sweet,\r\nfine-grained, and of superior flavor for one of this species. Tree\r\nhardy, exceedingly precocious and productive when grafted on strong,\r\nhealthy stock. A four-year-old tree on my grounds is shown in Fig.\r\n32. It was loaded with nuts in the fall of 1894. This is one of the\r\nbest of its class. Origin somewhat in doubt, but it is claimed that\r\nthe late W. L. Shaffer, of Philadelphia, raised it from a foreign\r\nnut planted in his garden, and who, some eighteen years or more ago,\r\ngave cions to W. H. Engle, of Marietta, Pa. Mr. Engle has since\r\npropagated and disseminated this variety quite extensively under its\r\npresent name, but should further investigation prove it to be\r\ndistinct and that it was raised by Mr. Shaffer, then it should\r\ncertainly bear his name, and Paragon become a synonym. No more\r\nappropriate monument could possibly be erected in honor of a\r\ndistinguished horticulturist like the late Mr. Shaffer, than a\r\nchestnut tree, nor could his memory be perpetuated under more\r\npleasant and agreeable surroundings than to have his name linked\r\ninseparably with such an excellent and valuable variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33. OPEN BUR OF THE RIDGELY CHESTNUT.]\r\n\r\nRIDGELY.--Burs large, with dense spines, but not as long as those of\r\nthe Paragon. Nuts large, pointed; shell dark brown, with very little\r\npubescence, and this mainly at the point (Fig. 33). In quality this\r\nvariety ranks very near, if not the equal of, the best of its class,\r\nand it has been highly commended, by those who have been acquainted\r\nwith it, for many years.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Ridgely, as recorded, leaves the question of name\r\na debatable one. Some sixty years ago a Mr. Dupont, of Wilmington,\r\nDel., gave or sent to Mr. D. M. Ridgely, of Dover, Del., a sprouted\r\nchestnut, and this was planted and became the original tree of the\r\nvariety under consideration. It has been called Dupont, because he\r\nraised the nut and kept it over winter and until it sprouted; then\r\nit passed into the care of Mr. Ridgely, who thenceforward gave it\r\nhis attention. The tree is now of immense size, and some seasons has\r\nproduced more than five bushels of nuts, selling at eleven dollars\r\nper bushel. It is quite probable that the Dupont family were the\r\nfirst to raise European chestnut trees to a bearing size in this\r\ncountry, for some of its members were settled in Delaware before the\r\nwar of the Revolution. Pierre Samuel Dupont de Nemours, during the\r\nFrench ministry of Vergennes, was employed in forming the treaty of\r\n1783, in which the independence of the United States was formally\r\nrecognized by England. In 1795 (Am. encyclopedia) he came to this\r\ncountry and joined his sons, who had become successful manufacturers\r\nof gunpowder at or near Wilmington, Del., where their descendants,\r\nor at least some of them, are still engaged in the same business. If\r\nany of the old and original chestnut trees have escaped the numerous\r\n\"powder mill explosions\" which have frequently occurred in that\r\nneighborhood, they are probably much older than the Ridgely. I am\r\nalso inclined to believe that a very large majority of all the hardy\r\nchestnut trees of the European species scattered about the country\r\nare the direct descendants of the old Dupont stock.\r\n\r\nSCOTT.--Burs large, with long branching spines. Nuts from the\r\noriginal tree, as received the past season, are only of medium size,\r\nbut said to be much larger on younger trees. Shell dark brown,\r\nsmooth, with a little fuzz around the point. As my specimen tree has\r\nnot, as yet, fruited, I am unable to say anything of its\r\nproductiveness from personal experience, but in a note from Mr.\r\nWilliam Parry, under date of Oct. 15, 1894, he says: \"I send\r\nspecimens of the Scott chestnuts, grown by Judge Scott, of\r\nBurlington, N. J. The crop is about gone and it was with difficulty\r\nI could get these, which are about the average size; earlier in the\r\nseason many are larger. Judge Scott has grown those nuts for market\r\nseveral years. The original tree was bought by his father many years\r\nago from the nursery of Thomas Hancock. He bought three trees for\r\nSpanish chestnuts, planted them in a row about thirty feet apart,\r\nand the one from which these nuts were obtained happened to be in\r\nthe middle. It is now a large tree, the trunk about five feet in\r\ndiameter. It is a regular and heavy bearer. Judge Scott has\r\npropagated and planted an orchard from this variety, and claims\r\namong its important features, large size and early\r\nbearing,--two-year grafts generally produce nuts; immense\r\nproductiveness and good quality; beautiful, glossy, mahogany color;\r\nfreedom from fuzz, and an almost entire exemption from the attacks\r\nof the chestnut weevil. While the crop of two trees standing on\r\neither side of the Scott is badly damaged by worms, it is the\r\nexception to find a wormy nut among the Scott.\r\n\r\n    \"The crop sells readily at ten to twelve dollars per bushel.\r\n    This year (1894) some sold as low as eight dollars, the lowest\r\n    ever known for this variety.\"\r\n\r\nSTYER.--Burs large, round; spines long, branching, but not as coarse\r\nas those of Comfort. Nuts medium to large, decidedly pointed, and\r\nthe point fuzzy. Shell dark brown, with a few longitudinal stripes,\r\nbut not ridged. A handsome nut of good quality. This variety has\r\nbeen distributed under the name of Hannum. The original tree, which\r\nis a mammoth in size, is still standing on the farm of a Mr. Hannum,\r\nnear Concordville, Delaware Co., Penn. But Mr. T. Walter Styer, of\r\nthe same place, is propagating and introducing it as the Styer.\r\n\r\nSome of the varieties in this group may not prove to be distinct,\r\nand later they will be relegated to their proper place as synonyms,\r\nbut I have thought it best to record them by the names under which\r\nthey have been received. In writing these descriptions I have had\r\nthe nuts and leaves before me, but there may be characters\r\noverlooked which will become more conspicuous as the grafted trees\r\nbecome older and more mature. The Dager chestnut, from Delaware, is\r\na promising variety, disseminated through the Department of\r\nAgriculture, but as I have not seen the nuts at this writing, a\r\ndescription is necessarily omitted.\r\n\r\nAmong the French varieties of this species which are said to succeed\r\nadmirably in California, a large proportion would probably do\r\nequally well in Delaware and further south. Among those worthy of\r\ntrial I may name the _Avant Chataigne_, _Comale_, _Exalade_, _Green\r\nof Lemousin_, _Grosse Precoce_, _Jaune Rousse_, _Lyons_, _Merle_,\r\n_Nouzillard_, _Quercy_, etc. I have tried some of these, but with\r\nsuch indifferent results that they were abandoned. Cultivators of\r\nnut trees located in a milder climate, should take advantage of\r\nwhatever improvements there have been made in Europe, by importing\r\ngrafted trees or cions. There are a few ornamental varieties of the\r\nEuropean chestnut, but none worthy of any special attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34. JAPAN GIANT CHESTNUT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35. SPINES OF JAPAN CHESTNUT.]\r\n\r\nJAPAN CHESTNUTS.--The first authentic account I have been able to\r\nfind of the introduction of the Japan chestnut into this country, is\r\nof a number of trees received by S. B. Parsons & Co., Flushing, N.\r\nY., 1876, from the late Thos. Hogg, who, as is well known to all\r\nhorticulturists, spent several years in Japan collecting many rare\r\nkinds of trees and shrubs, which were shipped direct to Parsons &\r\nCo. The chestnut trees received in 1876 fruited two years later, or\r\nin 1878, and soon attracted attention, on account of the large size\r\nand excellent quality of the nuts and the precocious habits of the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe success of this typical variety of the Japanese species, as I\r\nhave assumed to designate it, proved that there were oriental\r\nchestnuts--heretofore untested in this country--that were certainly\r\nworthy of an attempt to obtain. This variety, introduced by the\r\nMessrs. Parsons & Co., does not appear to have been disseminated\r\nunder any distinct varietal name, but merely bears the rather\r\nmeaningless one of Japan chestnut, and for the purpose of giving it\r\na position where it may be recognized--by name at least--from other\r\nvarieties more recently introduced, I shall take the liberty of\r\ncalling it \"Parsons' Japan.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after it became known that the oriental chestnuts would succeed\r\nin this country, the fruit growers and nurserymen of California\r\nbegan to import and plant these nuts, shipping an occasional lot to\r\ntheir customers in the Eastern States, and from these hundreds of\r\nseedlings have been raised and distributed, under the general name\r\nof Japan chestnut. Among the nuts imported there are some of\r\nextraordinary size, even larger than anything of the kind obtained\r\nfrom Europe, as shown in Fig. 34, natural size, and from a specimen\r\nreceived direct from Japan. Some of the nurserymen who have secured\r\nthese very large nuts for planting, offer the seedlings raised\r\ntherefrom under such names as Mammoth and Giant Japan, but as there\r\nis no certainty, and scarcely a probability, that such seedlings\r\nwill produce nuts as large as those planted, the names are rather\r\nmisleading, although proper enough if given to grafted varieties of\r\nlarge size. When an extra-fine variety is produced from the nut, it\r\nshould, of course, be preserved and propagated in the usual way.\r\n\r\nThe late Wm. Parry, of Parry, N. J., was one of the first nurserymen\r\nto attempt to produce new varieties of the Japan chestnut in this\r\ncountry, and his sons have continued his experiments in this\r\ndirection. Others may have been equally successful, but I have been\r\nunable to obtain any satisfactory reports from those to whom I have\r\napplied for information; consequently, I can only say that the\r\nfollowing, with few exceptions, originated at the Wm. Parry\r\nnurseries.\r\n\r\nADVANCE (Parry).--Burs medium, slightly flattened on top; spines\r\nmedium, short, almost sessile, as shown in Fig. 35, and this is a\r\ncharacteristic of all the Japan chestnuts; branching and widely\r\nseparated on a very thin husk. Nuts very large; shell a light\r\nyellowish brown, with a few slight darker streaks from base to apex.\r\nQuality excellent for one of this species. Ripens early, and long\r\nbefore touched by frost.\r\n\r\nALPHA (Parry).--Very similar to the last, but ripens earlier, which\r\nwould be an advantage in some localities. Tree vigorous and\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nBETA (Parry).--Bur medium; spines rather long and thin for one of\r\nthis group, set on a thin husk. Nut large; shell light brown,\r\nsmooth, with a slight trace of pubescence near the tip. The leaves\r\nare shallow and coarsely serrate, and on some the teeth or\r\nserratures are entirely wanting. Ripens a little later than the\r\nAlpha, or about the first of October in northern New Jersey.\r\n\r\nEARLY RELIANCE (Parry).--Burs medium, with short, almost deflexed\r\nspines, on an exceedingly thin husk. Nuts large, more pointed than\r\nin the last, and of a lighter color the past season, but this may\r\nnot be constant, and may be due to the long and severe drouth of the\r\nsummer of 1894. Usually three nuts in a bur, and sometimes four or\r\nfive, but I do not consider this increase in number a merit in any\r\nvariety, for where there are more than three they are likely to be\r\nof small size and very much deformed. The original tree of the\r\nReliance is enormously productive, and a regular bearer.\r\n\r\nFELTON.--A seedling of the common Japanese chestnut, raised by J. W.\r\nKillen, of Felton, Delaware.\r\n\r\nGIANT JAPAN (Parry).--Burs large to extra large for a variety of\r\nthis species, with medium low branching spines on a very thin,\r\nparchment-like husk. Nuts extra large, usually only two in a bur,\r\noften only one, and about two inches broad, much depressed at the\r\ntop, with a short point set in an irregular depression or basin.\r\nShell dark mahogany color, more or less ribbed; kernel coarse\r\ngrained, as is usual in the extra large varieties of nearly all\r\nspecies of the chestnut. This is probably the largest variety of the\r\nJapanese chestnut raised in this country, of which grafted trees are\r\nobtainable at this time. There may be others equally as large, but\r\nif so they are unknown to the writer.\r\n\r\nKILLEN.--Of the Japan species, and described as very large, the nuts\r\nover two inches in diameter and of fair quality. Raised by J. W.\r\nKillen, of Felton, Del.\r\n\r\nPARSONS' JAPAN.--Burs medium, with rather thick-set and long spines.\r\nNuts large, one inch and a half broad, curving regularly to a point;\r\nshell smooth, almost glossy, brown, with faint stripes of a darker\r\nshade extending from base to apex. In quality the kernel is far\r\nbetter than most of the European varieties, being finer grained and\r\nsweeter. When grafted on strong stocks the trees come into bearing\r\nearly, or in two or three years. This is the best known, and\r\nprobably the most widely distributed variety, of the Japanese\r\nspecies in this country, having been introduced, as I have stated\r\nelsewhere, in 1876.\r\n\r\nPARRY'S SUPERB (Parry).--Burs broad, cushion-shaped, or much\r\nflattened on top, with extra long, widely branching spines from\r\nsingle or multiple stems, very much as in the European varieties.\r\nBut the thin husk, the nuts, and the growth of tree, wood and\r\nleaves, stamp it as a pure Japanese variety. Nuts large, broader\r\nthan long, with a decided sharp woody point; almost entirely\r\ndestitute of even a sign of pubescence. A very promising and\r\ndistinct variety.\r\n\r\nSUCCESS (Parry).--Burs very large, broad, with only a few short,\r\nscattering, branching spines on the top, thicker toward the base; on\r\na thin, parchment-like husk, and this is so thin that it sometimes\r\ncracks open and exposes the nuts within before they are fully ripe.\r\nNuts extra large, nearly equal to the Giant, but of a more regular\r\nand symmetrical form, being nearly as long as broad, tapering to a\r\npoint. Shell smooth, dark brown, with a slight pubescence about the\r\npoint. Usually three nuts in a bur; an ideal variety in every\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of the Japan chestnut recently much lauded under\r\nthe name of Mammoth or Burbank, which is said to be of immense size,\r\nand as sweet as the common American chestnut.\r\n\r\n=Injurious Insects.=--The chestnut tree is rarely attacked by\r\ninsects. It is true that grubs may occasionally be found boring into\r\nthe wood or cutting sinuous burrows under the bark, but this is\r\nmainly in trees weakened by exposure, in removing protecting\r\ncompanions, as when removing forests, or by plowing up and\r\ndestroying the roots, in cultivating the land about them; but the\r\nattacks of insects upon such specimens is nature's way of getting\r\nrid of the feeble and least valuable, making room for the healthy\r\nand strong. But my thirty years' residence in a chestnut grove leads\r\nme to think that this nut tree is exceedingly free from wood borers\r\nof any kind.\r\n\r\nEntomologists, however, have noted several instances of insect\r\ndepredations upon individual trees, by a few species of the\r\nlong-horn beetles, three or four in all, but these occur so rarely\r\nthat they are scarcely worthy of notice as pests of the chestnut.\r\nThere are also several species of caterpillars occasionally found\r\nfeeding on the leaves of this tree, also some sucking bugs or tree\r\nhoppers, and two or three kinds of plant lice, but none of these\r\nhave, as yet, become at all formidable enemies, or likely to become\r\nso later. But the chestnut has one enemy which is so abundant and\r\ndestructive to the nuts as to call for an extended notice. I refer\r\nto the common native chestnut weevil (_Balaninus carytripes_,\r\nBoheman). The little fat, white, round, legless grubs, nearly or\r\nquite a half-inch long, must be familiar to every person who has\r\nhandled or eaten chestnuts raised in this country, whether of the\r\nexotic or native varieties. The parents of this grub are oval-shaped\r\nbeetles about one-half inch long or less; wing covers, body and legs\r\ndensely covered with a short yellow down, and from the front or\r\nthorax there extends a long, slightly curved, slender snout (Fig.\r\n36), sometimes nearly an inch in length in the females, but usually\r\nless in the males. The mouth parts are at the extreme end of this\r\nsnout or proboscis, and the female, with her mandibles, it is\r\nclaimed, reaches down among the chestnut spines and gnaws a hole in\r\nthe husk, into which she drops an egg; and when this hatches, the\r\nminute grub cuts its way through the green husk and into the nut,\r\nthe hole made in its progress closing up behind, leaving no mark or\r\nscar. Although I have taken hundreds of these weevils on chestnut\r\ntrees, I never have been so fortunate as to take one in the act of\r\novipositing, but have come so near it as to find the ovipositor\r\nstill extended as the insect crawled out from among the spines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36. CHESTNUT WEEVIL.]\r\n\r\nThe chestnut weevil usually appears in great numbers soon after the\r\ntrees bloom in spring, but they continue to come out all through the\r\nsummer; I have occasionally found them late in September, which\r\nprobably accounts for finding small and half-grown grubs in the nuts\r\nas they ripen and fall from the trees. These late grubs often remain\r\nin the nuts all winter, but the greater part escape earlier, or very\r\nsoon after the crop is ripe. The grubs crawl out of the nuts and\r\nwork their way into the ground to a depth of from a few inches to\r\ntwo feet, much depending upon the nature of the soil. Having very\r\npowerful jaws, they readily cut through a layer of leaves or soft\r\nwood, and I have known them to cut holes in sheets of dry cork.\r\nThese grubs remain in the ground until the following season, then\r\ncome forth in their winged or weevil stage, except the belated,\r\nbroods, or those that have not reached full size in the autumn;\r\nthese remain in the ground the entire summer, coming out late in the\r\nfall, or pass over until the second year, as I have proved by\r\nburying the grubs in a barrel sunk in the ground, covering the top\r\nwith fine wire netting, to prevent the escape of the weevils as they\r\nemerged from time to time during the season.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, we find only one grub in a nut, of the American sweet\r\nchestnut, but in the larger varieties of the European and Japanese,\r\ntwo or more is not unusual, which rather favors the idea that the\r\nfemale weevil does possess something akin to reason, which guides\r\nher in locating stores of food available for her progeny. I have\r\nnever observed that the weevils had any choice among varieties, all\r\nbeing subject to their attacks alike, provided all were growing in\r\nequally favorable positions. But if the trees are of different\r\nsizes, some tall and others short, some exposed to the winds and\r\nothers protected, then the ravages of this pest will, no doubt, be\r\nas variable as the surrounding conditions. As the weevils emerge\r\nfrom the ground in spring or early summer, they will naturally seek\r\nthe nuts most convenient and on the small trees, then those on the\r\nlower branches of the larger ones, while those on the upper part of\r\nthe tree, where they are fully exposed to the winds, may wholly\r\nescape the attacks of these pests. This leads me to think that\r\nwhoever attempts to cut off native chestnut forests, with the\r\nexpectation of renewal with the larger varieties, by grafting the\r\nsprouts, will find the chestnut weevil a rather formidable enemy. I\r\nhave found it so on a limited number of trees in my own grounds,\r\nthat are grown from grafted sprouts near large native specimens, the\r\nweevils destroying nearly every nut; but out in the field, away from\r\nthe woods, and where the young trees are scattered and exposed to\r\nthe full sweep of the winds, the nuts are sound and free from insect\r\nenemies. The only remedy is to collect and destroy the weevils,\r\nwhich is not a serious matter where only the larger varieties are\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\n=Diseases of the Chestnut.=--I have never noticed any special\r\ndisease among chestnuts, neither do I find any mentioned in European\r\nworks on forestry. The nearest approach to any such malady being\r\nrecorded as having appeared in this country, is found in a paragraph\r\nin Hough's \"Report on Forestry,\" 1877, p. 470, where the author\r\ncopies from Prof. W. C. Kerr, State Geologist, North Carolina, as\r\nfollows: \"The chestnut was formerly abundant in the Piedmont region,\r\ndown to the country between the Catawba and Yadkin rivers, but\r\nwithin the last thirty years they have mostly perished. They are now\r\nfound east of the Blue Ridge only, on higher ridges and spurs of the\r\nmountains. They have suffered injury here, and are dying out both\r\nhere and beyond the Blue Ridge. They are much less fruitful than\r\nthey were a generation ago, and the crop is much more uncertain.\"\r\n\r\nWhile there is nothing said about any chestnut disease in the\r\nparagraph quoted, we only infer that the author intended to convey\r\nthe idea that the trees were suffering from some endemic malady,\r\nalthough it may have been due to long drouths, insect depredators,\r\nor other causes. A few years later Mr. Hough, in his \"Elements of\r\nForestry,\" refers to the subject again, and admits that \"the cause\r\nof the malady is unknown.\" But as chestnuts continue to come to our\r\nmarkets in vast quantities from the Piedmont regions, there must be\r\na goodly number of healthy trees remaining.\r\n\r\n=Uses.=--The economic value of the chestnut, as food for mankind and\r\nthe lower animals, has been, and is still, so well known, that no\r\nextended dissertation or compilation of historic instances of its\r\nusefulness are required here. For almost two thousand years it has\r\nbeen an important article of food throughout southern Europe, and in\r\nsome of the mountainous districts it is almost the \"staff of life\"\r\namong the poorer people, who not only use these nuts in their raw\r\nstate, but roasted, boiled, stewed, and even dried and ground into\r\nflour, from which a coarse but nutritious kind of cake or bread is\r\nmade. These nuts are also used in the same way by the poorer classes\r\nof China and Japan, and probably in other oriental countries. In\r\nFrance, Italy, Spain and Portugal, the chestnut crop is of immense\r\nimportance, not only for domestic use, but commercially, because all\r\nsurplus is wanted by other nations, who are ever ready to take a\r\nshare, and pay a good round price for the same.\r\n\r\nIn this country chestnuts are mainly used as a luxury or a kind of\r\npocket lunch for the children, as they are rarely brought to the\r\ntable, and it is very doubtful if the American housewife, or our\r\ncooks,--unless foreign born and bred,--know anything about preparing\r\nthese delicious nuts for comestible purposes. Cereals, meats, fruits\r\nand vegetables have always been so abundant and cheap in this\r\ncountry, that the poorest of the poor could indulge in them without\r\nstint or limit; but all this will change sooner or later, and when\r\nour population has doubled or trebled, the edible nuts must become\r\nof much more importance than now, and a roast turkey stuffed with\r\nchestnuts may figure as the ideal of gastronomic art.\r\n\r\nAs our native chestnuts are now annually consumed by the thousands\r\nof bushels, and the imported varieties by millions of pounds, and\r\nall as a mere luxury,--not a necessity nor an article which we could\r\nnot dispense with without any serious inconvenience,--we may well\r\nconsider what the future demand must be, and make haste to meet it\r\nwith an abundant supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nFILBERT OR HAZELNUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorylus, _Tournefort_. Name from _korys_, a hood, helmet or bonnet,\r\nin reference to the form of the calyx or husk enclosing the nut.\r\nOrder, _Corylaceae_. Deciduous trees or low shrubs. Male flowers\r\nappearing in the autumn in pendulous cylindrical catkins two inches\r\nor more in length, with a two-cleft calyx partly united with the\r\nbracts or scales. These catkins remain on the plants all winter,\r\nbecoming fully developed, and shedding their pollen early the\r\nfollowing spring. Female flowers minute, entirely hidden within the\r\nbuds during the winter, but early in spring their bright red,\r\nthread-like stigmas push out from the tips of the lateral or\r\nterminal buds. Ovary two-celled, with one ovule in each. Nut\r\nglobular, ovoid or oblong, often in clusters, but each enclosed in a\r\nleafy, two- or three-valved husk, fringed or deeply notched at the\r\nupper end. Leaves broadly heart-shaped, serrate, with sturdy, short\r\nleaf-stalks. The filbert and hazel always bloom before the leaves\r\nappear in spring, and the male catkins usually open and begin to\r\nscatter their pollen in this latitude during warm days in March, the\r\nfemales soon following, their bright-red stigmas pushing out from\r\nthe ends of the buds, but as soon as fertilization has been\r\nconsummated they shrivel and disappear. The trees may then remain\r\nleafless for weeks following, and yet produce a heavy crop of fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37. LARGE FILBERT.]\r\n\r\nThe common English name, filbert, is from \"full-beard.\" All the\r\nvarieties with husks extending beyond the nut, and with fringed\r\nedges, are filberts (Fig. 37); while those with husks shorter than\r\nthe nuts (Fig. 38) are hazels, from the old Anglo-Saxon word,\r\n_haesel_, a hood or bonnet. The parentage, size, form or quality of\r\nthe nut, is not to be considered in this classification, for when\r\nthe nuts are ripe and fallen from the husks, there is nothing left\r\nto distinguish the hazelnuts from filberts, unless a person is\r\nsufficiently familiar with a variety to know to which group it\r\nbelongs. In France these nuts are known under the general name of\r\n_Noysette_; while in Germany it is _Haselnuss_; in Holland\r\n_Hazelnoot_; and in Italy _Avellana_, from Avellana, a city of\r\nNaples, near which there is a valley where these nuts have been\r\nextensively cultivated for many centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38. LARGE SEEDLING HAZELNUT.]\r\n\r\n=History of the Filbert.=--It is claimed that the filbert was first\r\nknown to the Romans as _Nux Pontica_, because introduced from\r\nPontus; but it must have become naturalized throughout southern\r\nEurope in very early times. But the Italian name of _Avellana_\r\nappears to have been applied to the wild hazel of Britain, long\r\nbefore Linnaeus adopted it as the specific name of the indigenous\r\nspecies. John Evelyn, one of the most careful and learned of English\r\narboriculturists of his time, in referring to these nuts, in his\r\n\"Sylva,\" 1664, says: \"I do not confound the filbert Pontic,\r\ndistinguished by its beard, with our foresters or bald hazelnuts,\r\nwhich, doubtless, we had from abroad, bearing the names of _Avelan_\r\nor _Avelin_, as I find in some ancient records and deeds in my\r\ncustody, where my ancestors' names were written Avelan, _alias_\r\nEvelin.\"\r\n\r\nThe filbert has been celebrated in prose and poetry from ancient\r\ntimes, as we may infer from a remark of Virgil, who says that it has\r\nbeen more honored \"than the vine, the myrtle, or even the bay\r\nitself\" (Eclogue vii).\r\n\r\nThe supposed occult power of a forked twig of the hazel as a\r\ndivining-rod (_virgula divinatoria_) for finding hidden treasures,\r\nveins of metals, subterranean streams of water, and even pointing\r\nout criminals, is, of course, purely mythical, although so solemnly\r\nattested by many learned men in the past; and I would not consider\r\nthis myth worthy of a notice here were it not for the fact that it\r\nwas early imported into this country, and is still firmly believed\r\nby many persons among our rural population. It is true that the\r\nsupposed attributes of the European hazel have been transferred to\r\ndifferent plants in this country, mainly to the peach and our\r\nindigenous witch-hazel (_Hamamelis Virginiana_), but the myth still\r\nlives, a legitimate descendant of an Old World nut tree.\r\n\r\nThere is little to be said in regard to the history of the filbert\r\nand hazelnut in this country, but it is quite likely that both of\r\nthe European species, and many varieties, were brought here and\r\nplanted by the early settlers in the Eastern States, and bushes of\r\nthe same could have been seen in many gardens a hundred years ago;\r\nbut I have been unable to find any account of extensive plantings of\r\nthese nuts, although nurserymen, all along, have been offering\r\nchoice varieties to their customers. In the main, our pomologists\r\nhave either remained silent in regard to these nuts, or, at most,\r\nreferred to them very briefly in their published works.\r\n\r\nWilliam Prince, of Flushing, N. Y., in a \"Short Treatise on\r\nHorticulture,\" published in 1828, refers to the filbert as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"This shrub or, in some cases, tree, accommodates itself to\r\n    every exposition, and to every variety of soil, but prefers a\r\n    moist loam on a sandy bottom, with a northern exposure. It is\r\n    easily multiplied by seeds, layers or inoculation. In fact,\r\n    these nuts, which are vended in large quantities in our markets,\r\n    grow as well in our climate as the common hazelnut, and produce\r\n    very abundantly. Such being the case, it is hoped, ere long,\r\n    sufficient will be produced from our soil to supersede the\r\n    necessity of importation, as plantations of this tree would\r\n    amply remunerate the possessor; or if planted as a hedge, would\r\n    be found to be very productive. A single bush of the Spanish\r\n    filbert in my garden has produced a half-bushel annually.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Prince then names a few of the best varieties, which are about\r\nthe same as those recommended at the present time, and he was, no\r\ndoubt, honest in recommending filbert culture to his countrymen, for\r\nhis own limited experience proved that the trees would grow here and\r\nfruit abundantly.\r\n\r\nA. J. Downing, in the first edition of his \"Fruits and Fruit Trees\r\nof America,\" 1845, says: \"The Spanish filbert, common in many of our\r\ngardens, is a worthless, nearly barren variety; but we have found\r\nthe better English sorts productive and excellent in this climate\r\n(Newburg, N. Y.), and at least a few plants of these should have a\r\nplace in all our gardens.\" If a few plants will succeed in a garden,\r\nthen we might reasonably suppose that the number might be safely\r\nincreased, and this was the idea of Mr. Prince, and many other\r\nwriters on the subject since his time, but I fail to find any record\r\nof extended experiments with these nuts in this country, and as\r\nthere must be some good reason for this neglect, perhaps my own\r\nexperience in the cultivation of the filbert and hazel, to be given\r\nin succeeding pages, may throw some light on this question.\r\n\r\n=Propagation.=--Filberts are readily propagated by almost all the\r\nmodes employed in the multiplication of ordinary fruit trees and\r\nshrubs. The nuts are not at all delicate, and may be planted in the\r\nfall, or stored in a cool place, mixed with sand or sphagnum, and\r\nthen put out in spring, always selecting a rather light and rich\r\nsoil for a seed bed, and in such beds plants from one to three feet\r\nhigh may be obtained the first season. The seedlings produce such a\r\nmass of fine roots that they are readily transplanted without danger\r\nof loss. Varieties are perpetuated and multiplied by budding,\r\ngrafting, suckers, layers, and some grow quite readily from cuttings\r\nmade of the young, vigorous shoots, cut up into proper lengths in\r\nthe fall, and then buried in the ground until the following spring,\r\nthen planted out in trenches, as usually practiced with currants,\r\ngrapes and similar plants. The method of propagation most generally\r\npracticed in Europe and this country is by suckers, and as the\r\ncultivated varieties of the filbert usually produce these from the\r\nbase of their stems in profusion, there is no lack of material;\r\nbesides, they make as strong, healthy and productive plants as can\r\nbe procured in any other way. To secure an extra number of roots on\r\nthese suckers, they should be banked up with a few inches in depth\r\nof good rich soil, or old manure, about midsummer, and then late in\r\nthe autumn dig down to the base and remove with knife or chisel,\r\nafter which they may be headed down to about fifteen or eighteen\r\ninches, and heeled-in for the winter, to be planted out in nursery\r\nrows early in spring. If a greater number of sprouts are wanted than\r\nthe plants naturally produce, the main stem may be cut down; but\r\nthis will seldom be necessary, because the young transplanted\r\nsuckers will usually produce more or less new ones the first season,\r\nall of which can be utilized for multiplying the stock if they are\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n=Soil, Location and Climate.=--European varieties of the filbert\r\nthrive best in what may be termed a rich loam, with a dry subsoil.\r\nIf the soil is too moist, the trees are inclined to run too much to\r\nwood, producing less fruit. In the famous nut orchards of Kent,\r\nEngland, the soil is loam upon a dry, sandy rock. The trees in these\r\norchards are manured at least once in two years, especially after\r\nthey reach the full bearing age. Almost any good soil that is rich\r\nenough to produce a good crop of corn, and is not submerged in\r\nwinter, will answer for the filbert in this country.\r\n\r\nIn selecting a location for a filbert orchard, an open, airy one\r\nwould probably be preferable to a spot so sheltered as to cause the\r\nflowers to appear so early as to be injured by frosts. Furthermore,\r\nI would warn cultivators to keep as far away as possible from any\r\nhedgerows or plantation of the wild native hazel bushes, for these\r\nare always loaded with disease germs that are fatal to the foreign\r\nspecies. We might reasonably suppose that filberts would succeed\r\nbetter in the Southern than in the Northern States, but if the\r\nexperience of those who have tried them there count for anything,\r\nthen these nuts are not adapted to the South, owing to the fact that\r\nthe flowers almost invariably push out during warm days in winter,\r\nand these are destroyed later by frosts. In the more elevated\r\nregions of the northern border of the Southern, and in similar\r\nlocations in the Middle States, these nuts will doubtless thrive, or\r\nat least the climate will prove congenial. The more equable the\r\nclimate and free from extremes in temperature, the better; but the\r\nmost important element in this country is moisture, especially in\r\nsummer, when the nuts are filling out; and the best way to supply\r\nthis, where irrigation cannot be practiced, is to keep the ground\r\naround the trees continually covered with a mulch of leaves or other\r\ncoarse vegetable matter.\r\n\r\n=Planting and Pruning.=--The space to be allowed between the plants,\r\nwhen set out for bearing, will, of course, depend very much upon the\r\nsize they are expected to attain. Those varieties which assume and\r\nremain in the bush form may be planted very close together, or not\r\nmore than six to eight feet between the plants; but those which\r\nbecome small trees must be given more room. The larger European\r\nsorts, which are at present the only ones worth cultivating for\r\ntheir nuts, should be set ten or twelve feet apart, and the rows\r\nfifteen to sixteen feet, then if properly pruned they will shade the\r\nground and be in a convenient form for gathering the crop. The trees\r\nmay be planted in the orchard when quite small, and some kind of\r\nvegetable crop grown among them for the first two or three years,\r\nbut I would prefer keeping the plants in nursery rows until they\r\nwere four or five feet high, and then transplant to the orchard, and\r\nset a short, stout stake by the side of each, to keep the main stem\r\nin an upright position until the tree is well established.\r\n\r\nThe first pruning,--except removing suckers from those in the\r\nnursery rows,--will be the heading back of the main or central stem\r\nto a hight of two or three feet, for the purpose of laying the\r\nfoundation, as it were, of the head of the future tree. Three or\r\nfour of the larger branches, which will push out from near the top\r\nof the severed main stem, are to be selected to form the top, and\r\nall others removed. Small lateral branches or twigs will spring out\r\nfrom the larger or main ones, and in this way the head of a bearing\r\ntree is formed. But before attempting to prune a mature or fruitful\r\ntree, we must consider the mode of fructification, for the filbert\r\ndoes not bear nuts on the young growth of the season, as in the\r\nchestnut, but on the small branchlets or spur-like twigs of the\r\npreceding season, or, as we may say, on the one-year-old twigs. The\r\nsmall fruiting twigs are seldom more than four to six inches long,\r\nand sometimes almost every well-developed bud on these contain\r\npistillate flowers and embryo nuts, either singly or in clusters. In\r\npruning the bearing trees, the main point to be observed is to head\r\nback the strong leading shoots, to prevent the trees growing too\r\ntall, as well as to force out the side or lateral twigs as fruiting\r\nwood for the ensuing year. If the heads of the trees become too much\r\ncrowded to admit light and air to the center, some of the larger\r\nbranches must be removed entire. The best time to prune is in early\r\nspring, when the trees are in bloom, for at this season we can\r\nreadily determine the injured from the sound male catkins, and\r\npreserve enough of these to insure perfect fertilization. It is not\r\nnecessary, however, that there should be healthy pollen-bearing\r\ncatkins on every tree in an orchard, for if one in a dozen is well\r\nsupplied, there will be sufficient to fertilize the flowers of all\r\ngrowing near by. It often happens, in our rather severe climate,\r\nthat the catkins of some trees or varieties are winterkilled, while\r\nthe pistillate flowers enclosed in the buds escape injury, and when\r\nthis occurs it is well to have some hardy variety at hand, from\r\nwhich pollen can be obtained when needed. The inferior varieties are\r\nusually the most hardy, and the wild European hazel or our northern\r\nbeaked hazel, will usually escape injury where all the large\r\nimproved sorts fail, and it requires but a few minutes' labor to cut\r\nbranches bearing sound catkins, and scatter these about through the\r\nheads of trees requiring such assistance to make them fruitful.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIES OF AMERICAN HAZELS.\r\n\r\nCORYLUS AMERICANA (Walters). Common hazel bush.--Leaves roundish,\r\nheart-shaped, pointed, coarsely serrate; husk somewhat downy, with a\r\nwide, flattened, fringed border extending beyond the roundish nut.\r\nShell rather thick and brittle; kernel sweet and good, but the nut\r\nis too small to be considered of much value. A low shrub, with many\r\nstems springing from the roots. Young shoots and twigs downy and\r\nglandular-hairy. Common in woods and old fields from Canada to\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\nCORYLUS ROSTRATA (Aiton). Beaked hazel.--Leaves ovate or oblong,\r\nsomewhat heart-shaped, pointed, doubly serrate; husk extending an\r\ninch or more beyond the round or ovoid nut, forming before it opens\r\na long tubular beak, hence the name. The husk is densely covered\r\nwith nettle-like bristles, which are quite irritating to tender\r\nhands. The nuts are small, usually growing in clusters at the ends\r\nof the twigs, only a few coming to maturity. A low shrub or small\r\ntree, usually growing in a dense clump, not spreading from\r\nsubterranean stems, as in the last species. Common on rather firm\r\nand rich soil along the borders of streams, in the northern border\r\nStates, and southward on the Alleghanies, but most abundant in the\r\nnorth through Canada, and westward to the Pacific in Washington and\r\nOregon, where, in the mountains, it often assumes the tree form,\r\ngrowing to a hight of twenty-five to thirty feet, with a stem from\r\nfour to six inches in diameter. The wood is light, soft, and very\r\nwhite to the center. It also extends southward to central\r\nCalifornia, but here it is only a small bush, this form having been\r\ndescribed under the name of _Corylus rostrata_, var. Californica, A.\r\nde C. This species probably reaches its highest development in the\r\nCascade range, in northern Oregon. The same or a closely allied\r\nspecies of the hazel extends far into northern Asia. There are no\r\nimproved varieties of either of our native species of the hazel in\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN SPECIES OF CORYLUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39. CONSTANTINOPLE HAZEL.]\r\n\r\nCORYLUS AVELLANA (Linn.). Common hazelnut.--Leaves roundish,\r\nheart-shaped, pointed, coarsely and unevenly serrate; husk\r\nbell-shaped, spreading, with a fringed or deeply cut margin. The\r\noriginal form of this nut is supposed to have been ovate or oval,\r\nbut with a plant indigenous to such a wide range of climate and\r\ncountry, and one that has been so long under cultivation,--running\r\nwild in many localities where it is not a native,--it would be very\r\ndifficult at this time to determine its primary botanical\r\ncharacters. A common shrub or small tree throughout the greater part\r\nof Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nCORYLUS COLURNA (Linn.).--Constantinople hazel. Leaves roundish\r\novate, heart-shaped; husk double, the inner one divided into three\r\ndeeply cleft divisions, the outer with many long, slender, curved\r\nsegments, giving to the calyx or husk a fringed appearance, but\r\nleaving the end of the nut fully exposed (Fig. 39). Nuts small, and\r\nfor this reason rarely cultivated. Native of Asia Minor, where the\r\ntree attains a hight of from fifty to sixty feet. It is, however,\r\nhardy in France and England, and was introduced into the latter\r\ncountry some three hundred years ago, probably by Clusius, who\r\nreceived either nuts or plants from Constantinople, hence its\r\npresent name.\r\n\r\nThere are several other hazels and filberts, so distinct from the\r\ntwo common European types that botanists have, in a few instances,\r\nbeen inclined to elevate them to the rank of species, and among\r\nthese I may name _Corylus heterophylla_, or various-leaved filbert,\r\nfrom eastern Asia, also the _Corylus ferox_, or spiny filbert, which\r\nhas a long and deeply cut or fringed husk. It is a native of the\r\nSheopur mountain in Nepaul. But from the two common European\r\nspecies, _C. Avellana_ and _C. Colurna_, and their hybrids, many\r\nhundreds of varieties have been raised, and from among these we may\r\nreadily select a dozen possessing all the distinct and estimable\r\nproperties to be found in this genus of nut-bearing plants; to\r\nmultiply names without securing anything of intrinsic value, is but\r\na waste of time and labor on the part of the cultivator.\r\n\r\nAs we have no popular varieties of American origin, I am compelled\r\nto consult European catalogues in making a selection of those most\r\npromising for cultivation here, and this is, perhaps, an advantage,\r\ninasmuch as our transatlantic cousins have had a long experience and\r\nabundant opportunities for determining the merits of the varieties\r\nthey recommend. If hardiness and adaptation to our soil and climate\r\nare to be taken into account, in making a selection, then we may\r\nfail for the want of experienced guides, as it is undeniable that\r\nvery few persons in this country have ever attempted to conduct\r\nextended experiments in the cultivation of either the native or\r\nEuropean species and varieties of the hazel.\r\n\r\nTaking this view of the situation, I shall avail myself of the small\r\nbut select list of varieties given in that standard work, \"The\r\nDictionary of Gardening,\" edited by Mr. George Nicholson, of the\r\nRoyal Gardens, Kew, England.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECT LIST OF VARIETIES.\r\n\r\nALBA, OR WHITE FILBERT.--Considered in England one of the best\r\nvarieties in cultivation. From the peculiar structure of the husk,\r\nwhich contracts rather than opens at the outer edge, this filbert\r\ncan be kept longer in its cover than most others. As fashion demands\r\nthat fresh filberts must be brought to the table in their husks,\r\nthis variety deserves special attention. It is also known as\r\nAvelinier Blanche, Wrotham Park, etc.\r\n\r\nCOSFORD, OR MISS YOUNG'S THIN-SHELLED.--Nut oblong, of excellent\r\nquality; husk hairy, deeply cut, about as long as the nut. Highly\r\nvalued on account of the thinness of the shell.\r\n\r\nCRISPA, OR FRIZZLED FILBERT.--Shell thin, somewhat flattened; husk\r\nrichly and curiously frizzled throughout, open wide at the mouth,\r\nand hanging about as long again as the nut. Ripens late, and one of\r\nthe most productive.\r\n\r\nDOWNTON LARGE SQUARE.--Nut very large; shell thick and well-filled;\r\nhusk smooth, shorter than the nut. A peculiarly formed semi-square\r\nnut, of the best quality.\r\n\r\nLAMBERT'S FILBERT (_Corylus tubulosa_).--Nut large, oblong; shell\r\nthick and strong, the kernel being covered with a red skin; husk\r\nlong, rather smooth, serrated at the edges, longer than the nut. A\r\nfine, strong-growing, free-fruiting variety. It is quite popular in\r\nCalifornia, where it has been in cultivation for twenty years or\r\nmore under the name of Red Aveline. Specimens I have received from\r\nthere were not as large as those raised in England, but this can be\r\naccounted for by the difference in climate. This variety is\r\ncultivated in Europe under various local names, as, for instance,\r\nGreat Cob, Kentish Cob, Filbert Cob, and Large Bond Cob.\r\n\r\nGRANDIS, OR ROUND COB-NUT.--Nut large, short, slightly compressed,\r\nvery thick and hard; husk shorter than the fruit, much frizzled and\r\nhairy. This is supposed to be the true Barcelona nut of commerce,\r\nand is one of the finest grown. This is the large round hazel or\r\nfilbert so largely imported for the trade in this country. It has\r\nmany synonyms, and among them we may record Downton, Dwarf Prolific,\r\nGreat Cob and Round Cob.\r\n\r\nPURPLE-LEAVED FILBERT.--Usually cultivated as an ornamental shrub in\r\nthis country, but under proper treatment it is one of the most\r\nvaluable for its fruit. Leaves very large, and of a deep purple\r\ncolor. Nuts and husk of the same color, which they retain until cut\r\nby frosts. Nuts large, an inch in length; husks much longer than the\r\nnut, and slightly hairy. The catkins are tender and become\r\nwinterkilled in our Northern States, but if the pistillate flowers\r\nare fertilized by pollen from some more hardy plant, this\r\npurple-leaved filbert is exceedingly prolific. I have gathered\r\neighty nuts from a small bush in my garden, the flowers of which had\r\nbeen fertilized from another variety in early spring.\r\n\r\nRED FILBERT. Red Hazel, Avelinier Rouge.--Nut medium ovate, not long\r\nas in the _tubulosa_, or Lambert's filbert; shell thick; husk long\r\nand hispid. A very productive variety of good quality.\r\n\r\nSPANISH FILBERT.--Nut very large, oblong; shell thick; husk smooth,\r\nlonger than the nut. A very large variety, sometimes confounded with\r\nthe Round cob-nut and its synonyms.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH FILBERTS.\r\n\r\nBelieving that our failures are often of far more value, in the line\r\nof education, than our successes, I shall not hesitate to place my\r\nown on record as guideposts to those who may be seeking the most\r\ndirect road to success in nut culture. Having had a rather extended\r\nand expensive experience in the cultivation of filberts, I propose\r\ngiving a brief account of it here, with the hope that it may save\r\nsome other enthusiast from losing time and money.\r\n\r\nMy attention was first specially drawn to these nuts in 1858,--while\r\na resident of the city of Brooklyn, N. Y.,--by a neighbor who had a\r\nmoderately large garden, on three sides of which he had planted a\r\nrow of English filberts. These trees, at the time, had attained a\r\nhight of about fifteen feet, with broad, open heads, and they rarely\r\nfailed to produce a heavy crop of nuts, which sold readily at very\r\nremunerative prices, for as they were always gathered in the husks\r\nand sold by the pound, the amount obtained from these few trees\r\nseemed to be enormous, considering the small space they occupied in\r\nthis garden. The owner of these filbert trees, being an Englishman\r\nby birth, never tired of showing his English filberts to visitors,\r\nand of descanting upon their value, as well as upon the stupid\r\nindifference of the Yankees in neglecting the cultivation of these\r\nvaluable nuts. I imbibed enough of my neighbor's enthusiasm to\r\nsecure a good stock of his plants, a few years later, for\r\ncultivation in my grounds here. The third year after planting, quite\r\na number of the bushes produced a fair crop of nuts, but I noticed\r\nthat an occasional shoot was affected with blight, and these were\r\nimmediately cut out and burned. The next season more of the branches\r\nwere affected, and from these the blight extended downward on the\r\nmain stems, and when these were cut away the sprouts from below made\r\na very vigorous and apparently healthy growth, some reaching a hight\r\nof six feet the first season, but a year or two later these were\r\nalso attacked and destroyed by blight.\r\n\r\nFinding that the filberts in my grounds were doomed, I visited my\r\nold neighbor in Brooklyn, hoping to learn something of the origin or\r\ncause of the disease; but the blight had invaded his garden, and not\r\na tree remained. On my return from this visit I had every filbert\r\nand hazel plant on my place dug up and burned, thinking by such\r\nmeans to stamp out the disease. After waiting ten years, I thought\r\nit time to try filberts again, and to be certain of securing pure\r\nand healthy plants, I concluded to raise them from the nuts, and\r\nsent an order for a few pounds of the largest and best variety to be\r\nfound in the celebrated filbert orchards of Kent, Eng. In due time\r\nthe nuts arrived, and they were very large, and all of one variety,\r\nas ordered. They were mixed with sand and buried in the garden until\r\nthe following spring, then sown thinly in shallow drills and covered\r\nwith about two inches of rich soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40. ENGLISH FILBERT ORCHARD, FIVE YEARS FROM\r\nSEED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42. EXTRA LARGE HAZEL SEEDLING OR ROUND ENGLISH\r\nFILBERT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41. VARIETIES OF FILBERTS AND HAZEL SEEDLINGS.]\r\n\r\nAt the close of the first season the plants were from one to two\r\nfeet high and quite stocky, with a mass of small fibrous roots. The\r\nnext spring they were transplanted into nursery rows, and set about\r\none foot apart. The third spring I laid out about one acre for a\r\nspecimen filbert orchard, and after the ground had been thoroughly\r\nprepared, the plants were set ten feet apart in the row, and twelve\r\nbetween the rows. No crop was planted among the trees, but the\r\nground was kept clean and free from weeds during the summer, with\r\ncultivator and harrow. All suckers springing from the base of the\r\nstems were removed as soon as they appeared, and under such\r\ntreatment the plants made a vigorous growth. Two years later quite a\r\nnumber of the trees came into bearing, these showing that I was\r\nlikely to have nearly as many varieties in my orchard as there were\r\ntrees. Some of the varieties might be better than the parent, but\r\nthe greater part were certain to be inferior in size. The fourth\r\nyear after planting in the orchard the trees gave me a heavy crop of\r\nnuts, and they made a fine appearance as one looked down between the\r\nlong rows, as shown in Fig. 40. But this season my old enemy, the\r\nfilbert blight, appeared again, and branches and main stems began to\r\nblacken and the leaves to wither. But I had bushels of nuts and in\r\ngreat variety, and by sending specimen baskets of the long-husk\r\nvarieties to dealers in New York, learned that there was an almost\r\nunlimited demand for such nuts, at prices ranging from thirty to\r\nseventy-five cents per pound, if sent to market in their fresh,\r\nhalf-ripened husk; but later on, when the nuts have fallen out and\r\nbecome thoroughly ripened, as when imported, ten cents a pound may\r\nbe considered an average price for the larger varieties. Several of\r\nthese are shown in Fig. 41, of natural size and form. Another\r\nextra-large hazel is shown in Fig. 42. The fifth year after\r\nplanting, my specimen filbert orchard had suffered so much from\r\nblight that it appeared as shown in Fig. 43; but a few dozen trees\r\nhave been reserved, the rest being removed and reduced to ashes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43. FILBERT ORCHARD STRUCK WITH BLIGHT, FIFTH\r\nYEAR FROM SEED.]\r\n\r\n=Name and Nature of the Filbert Blight.=--The reader must not\r\nsuppose that one who has spent as much time and money as the writer\r\nin experimenting with these nuts, would make no effort to discover\r\nthe origin and name of such a virulent disease, and means of\r\ndestroying it if these were known. For many years I had been well\r\naware of its presence in nearly all of the nurseries of the older\r\nStates, as well as in the public parks and private gardens. In the\r\nmeantime I had diligently examined the reports of the Division of\r\nVegetable Pathology of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, as well\r\nas the hundreds of bulletins of the various State experiment\r\nstations, treating of the fungous diseases of plants, all without\r\nfinding a hint or reference to this widely distributed and\r\ndestructive blight of the filbert. I also sent many specimens of the\r\ndiseased twigs and branches to professional mycologists, with no\r\nbetter results. With the nature of the disease, its mode of\r\nmultiplication and distribution, I had become somewhat familiar, but\r\nthe information sought was: Had it ever been described and given a\r\nscientific name, and if so, where, and by whom? This much of its\r\nhistory had somehow escaped me, and, as it would appear from the\r\nfollowing correspondence, the chances were none too good of finding\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn reply to an inquiry directed to the U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture, Division of Vegetable Pathology, I received the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, D. C., Aug. 4, 1894.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n    Your letter of Aug. 2, relating to the disease of the filbert,\r\n    is at hand. In reply I have to say that we have not investigated\r\n    this trouble, and are therefore unable to furnish you with any\r\n    definite information upon it. Specimens of the disease, as you\r\n    describe it, have never been, so far as I know, referred to the\r\n    Division, nor am I able to find any record of any such disease\r\n    in foreign or domestic literature. If you will send us specimens\r\n    we shall be pleased to examine them and furnish you a report. We\r\n    should also be pleased to have any information from you in\r\n    regard to the manner in which the disease works. Very truly,\r\n\r\n  B. T. GALLOWAY, _Chief of Division_.\r\n\r\nThe specimens requested were forwarded promptly by mail, and in the\r\nabsence of the Chief of Division, they fell into the hands of one of\r\nhis assistants, who reported as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n    Your letter of Aug. 7 is received, together with the specimens.\r\n    The stems of the _Corylus_ are affected with one of the\r\n    Pyrenomycetes. _Cryptospora anomala_, Pk. The fungus is\r\n    described in \"North American Pyrenomycetes,\" by Ellis and\r\n    Everhart, p. 531. It attacks _Corylus Americana_, but appears to\r\n    be worst on the European varieties, as you say. The pustules\r\n    appear first on the young branches, and later on the older ones\r\n    and on the trunk. The roots are not killed.\r\n\r\n    The only remedy known is to cut out and burn the diseased stems.\r\n    Whether Bordeaux mixture or any other copper solution will\r\n    protect the shrub from attack, is not known. So far as I know,\r\n    it has not been tried. It is probable, however, that if the\r\n    stems were thoroughly sprayed with the Bordeaux mixture they\r\n    would be protected from attack. The mycelium of the fungus grows\r\n    into the cambium and practically girdles the stems. The black\r\n    pustules contain the spores.\r\n\r\n  Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n  ALBERT F. WOODS, _Acting Chief_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of this note of Prof. Woods, I looked up Ellis and\r\nEverhart's work, a voluminous one of over 800 octavo pages,\r\npublished by the authors at Newfield, N. J. This filbert blight is\r\nbriefly described under the scientific name of _Cryptospora\r\nanomala_, Pk., but Prof. Peck writes me that \"the description was\r\nmade from specimens discovered near Albany, N. Y., in May, 1874. In\r\n1882 this description was republished by Saccardo, in his \"Syllage\r\nFungorum,\" Vol. I, p. 470, under the name of _Cryptosporella\r\nanomala_. The original name in Report 28, p. 72, was _Diatrype\r\nanomala_. In 1892 Ellis and Everhart, in \"Pyrenomycetes of North\r\nAmerica,\" p. 531, changed the name again, making it _Cryptospora\r\nanomala_.\" So at present we have the names of this fungus in the\r\nfollowing order:\r\n\r\n  _Diatrypes anomal_, Peck, 1876.\r\n  _Cryptosporella anomala_, Sacc., 1882.\r\n  _Cryptospora anomala_, E. and E., 1892.\r\n\r\nEllis and Everhart, after giving scientific description, add,\r\n\r\n    \"On living stems of _Corylus Americana_, Albany, N. Y. (Peck),\r\n    Iowa (Holoway), on _Corylus Avellana_, Newfield, N. J. The\r\n    pustules appear first on the smaller branches, and are serrately\r\n    arranged along one side of the branch; afterwards they appear\r\n    also on the larger branches and on the trunk itself, and in the\r\n    course of two or three years the part of tree above ground is\r\n    entirely killed. The roots, however, still retain their\r\n    vitality, and continue to send up each year a luxuriant growth\r\n    of new shoots, destined to be destroyed the succeeding year by\r\n    the inexorable pest. The imported trees seem to be more\r\n    injuriously affected than the native species.\"\r\n\r\nThe observations of Ellis and Everhart and Prof. Woods accord with\r\nmy own, but I may say that the infested branches often show the\r\npresence of the mycelium in the bark and alburnum,--by a slight\r\nshrinking,--weeks or months before the pustules appear, for these\r\nare merely indications of the last stage in the life of the fungus,\r\nand with the throwing off the spores from these pustules the old\r\nparasite perishes.\r\n\r\nThe pustules, when fully open, are from one-sixteenth to one-eighth\r\nof an inch in diameter, usually round, but sometimes slightly oval\r\nin form, and placed mainly in almost straight rows lengthways of the\r\nbranch, as shown in Fig. 44. These pustules appear on wood of all\r\nages, from two years upward, and in what may be termed patches,\r\nranging from a few inches to a foot or more in length, and more\r\nfrequently on the upper side than the underside of the branches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44. HAZEL FUNGUS.]\r\n\r\nThis fungus is undoubtedly indigenous, and its host plant is the\r\ncommon American hazel (_C. Americana_). From a very careful search,\r\nI have not been able to find any clump of these bushes of any\r\nconsiderable size that was entirely free from pustulous stems. But\r\non these wild plants it seems to do but little harm, for if a stem\r\nis killed, another soon springs up from the roots to take its place;\r\nbut when this fungus invades our orchards and gardens and attacks\r\nfilbert trees, we recognize it as an implacable enemy. How far the\r\nspores of this fungus are likely to be carried by the wind,\r\ntransported on the clothes of a person, or the hair of domestic\r\nanimals, I do not know, but it certainly is not safe to plant the\r\nsusceptible species and varieties within a mile of the wild hazel\r\nbushes, unless the planter is prepared to use fungicides freely on\r\nhis trees. There are certain phases of this filbert blight that are\r\nrather obscure and scarcely explainable; as, for instance, its\r\nvirulence among some species and varieties, and almost if not total\r\nabsence among others. So far as my observation extends, I have never\r\nfound it attacking the native beaked hazel (_Corylus rostrata_), and\r\nmy correspondents in the Northwest and in the Pacific States assure\r\nme that no blight on the hazel has, as yet, been found there, and\r\nits absence is probably due to the fact that the common hazel (_C.\r\nAmericana_) is not an inhabitant of these regions.\r\n\r\nIn a neighbor's garden just across the highway from my own, there\r\nare, at this time, four old European hazelnut trees, fully twenty\r\nfeet high and as many years old. They are of two varieties: one a\r\nsmall round nut, the other a long, slender nut, but neither of much\r\nvalue, because of their small size. The trees, however, are\r\nperfectly healthy, never having suffered from the blight, although\r\nthese four are all that remain of a long row of choice European\r\nvarieties all planted at the same time. Blight destroyed the better\r\nvarieties, while these inferior ones continue to thrive and are\r\nexceedingly productive.\r\n\r\nThis native fungus that causes blight in the hazels is but one of a\r\nlarge number of similar maladies which have appeared and often\r\nworsted the horticulturist, in his endeavor to introduce and\r\ncultivate foreign species and varieties of plants, and like the\r\ntropical fevers, they may pass unnoticed among the natives, but are\r\nterribly fatal to immigrants from cooler climates. The disease so\r\nwell known as the black knot (_Otthia morbosa_, Schu.), and widely\r\ndestructive to the European varieties of the plum, and Morello\r\ncherries, has existed for ages among our native plums and black\r\ncherries, doing comparatively little harm; but it seems to protest,\r\nby its virulence, against the introduction of some foreign species.\r\nThe same is true with various blights and rusts which attack the\r\nexotic pear, apple, quince, peach, and other of the larger fruits,\r\nand we have only to ascend the scale a few degrees from the\r\nmicroscopic fungi to the microscopic insects, to meet on the very\r\nthreshold of this realm the minute but unconquerable grape louse\r\n(_Phylloxera vastatrix_), which for more than two centuries has\r\nprevented the successful cultivation of the European varieties of\r\nthe grape in the open air everywhere east of the Rocky mountains in\r\nNorth America; although this minute insect has ever been present and\r\na constant parasite of the indigenous species of the grape, but\r\nscarcely affecting the health of its host. The plum curculio,\r\nchestnut and hickory weevils, bean weevil, and many other similar\r\nspecies of insects appear to be ever protesting against the\r\nintroduction of exotic plants, as well as the improvement of our\r\nindigenous kinds.\r\n\r\nIt is this blight, and nothing else, that has prevented the\r\nextensive cultivation of the improved varieties of the European\r\nfilbert and hazelnut in this country, and not the uncongenial soil\r\nand climate, as has been so often \"officially\" proclaimed by men\r\nwhose theories are far greater than their practical knowledge of\r\nsuch subjects. Men whose experience with these nuts has been limited\r\nto a few isolated bushes or trees in gardens or nurseries, where\r\nthey were protected, or beyond the reach of the spores of the blight\r\nfungus, as has already been noted in the experience of Prince,\r\nDowning, Barry, and my neighbor Butler, of Brooklyn, could scarcely\r\nunderstand why others should remain so indifferent to such a\r\npromising industry, or why the demand for the trees remained so\r\nlimited, with scarcely an attempt to plant filbert orchards anywhere\r\nin this country. Nurserymen have continued to offer the choice\r\nvarieties at low prices per plant, and to advise their customers to\r\ncultivate filberts extensively, even to setting them in hedgerows;\r\nand yet home-grown filberts remain as rare in our markets as they\r\nwere a hundred years ago, and all due to the simple reason that the\r\ninsidious filbert blight still scatters its spores unrestrained.\r\n\r\nWith the present almost universal employment of various fungicides\r\nfor the destruction of blights, mildews and rusts on cultivated\r\nfruits and vegetables, we may confidently assert that the diseases\r\nof the filbert may be readily controlled by the same means. The\r\nspraying of the trees with Bordeaux mixture and other copper\r\nsolutions will certainly destroy the fungus spores, and with these\r\nout of the way filbert culture may become of as much importance and\r\nas popular here as it is in certain countries of Europe. In my own\r\nexperience I have found no other nut tree (barring always the\r\nblight) that has been more satisfactory. The plants come forward\r\nrapidly, fruiting freely and abundantly when young, and if properly\r\ntrained, the crop can be gathered with little labor, and as it is\r\nready for use a month or more in advance of the arrival of fresh\r\nnuts from abroad, the home market during the time is at our command.\r\n\r\nThe number of applications of the fungicides that will be necessary\r\nduring the season to rid the trees of blight, or the strength of the\r\ncopper solution used, will depend somewhat upon circumstances and\r\nthe condition of the subjects operated upon. If the trees are\r\ngrowing near hedges of wild hazels, where there is a constant or\r\nannual influx of the fungus spores, then greater care will be\r\nrequired to suppress them than if the trees are some distance from\r\nsuch sources of contagion; and it may be well for those\r\ncontemplating planting filbert orchards, to examine their\r\nsurroundings carefully in advance, in order to avoid local\r\nblight-breeding plants, and have these destroyed if any are found. I\r\nwould also warn the cultivator against collecting branches of the\r\nwild hazel in the spring, carrying pollen-bearing catkins to be\r\nemployed in fertilizing the pistillate flowers of the cultivated\r\nvarieties, for by such means blight spores may be readily introduced\r\ninto orchard and garden.\r\n\r\nIt will seldom be necessary to practice artificial fertilization,\r\nwhere any considerable number of trees are grown near together,\r\nbecause if ninety per cent. of the male catkins are winterkilled,\r\nthe few remaining will be sufficient to supply pollen for the\r\npistillate flowers. In my grounds filberts have never failed to\r\nproduce annual crops after reaching a bearing age, although they\r\nhave been subjected to great extremes of temperature in winter. One\r\nyear the trees were in full bloom the last week in February, and\r\nalthough cold weather followed, the protected pistillate flowers\r\nwere not injured. The winters of 1894 and 1895 were among the\r\nseverest, in the way of continuous low temperature, I have ever\r\nexperienced here, and while the filberts did not bloom until the\r\nfirst week in April, the crop proved to be abundant.\r\n\r\n=Insects Injurious to Filberts.=--My personal observations lead me\r\nto believe that the filberts and hazels are, in this country,\r\nremarkably free from the depredations of noxious insects. Two\r\nspecies of nut weevils have been reported as breeding in the wild\r\nhazelnuts, viz., _Balaninus obtusus_, and _B. nasicus_, but among\r\nthe many bushels of the European varieties of the filbert produced\r\nin my grounds I have never found one infested by a weevil or other\r\ninsect. In Europe a nut weevil (_B. nucum_) is said to be very\r\ndestructive to the wild hazel, often invading the filbert orchards,\r\nand this we can readily believe, because they are not at all\r\nuncommon in the imported nuts, but fortunately have not, as yet,\r\nbecome naturalized in this country.\r\n\r\nThe great hazel-leaf beetle, or as more generally known, elm-leaf\r\nbeetle (_Monocesta coryli_), has been known in a few instances to\r\nattack and defoliate large patches of the wild hazel bushes, but\r\nthis insect seems to prefer the elm, hence is rarely found on the\r\nhazels. But should it ever invade our filbert orchards, it can be\r\nreadily destroyed by dusting or spraying the trees with Paris green,\r\nLondon purple, or other well-known insecticides. There may be an\r\noccasional invasion of caterpillars, like the tent worms, spanworms,\r\nleaf rollers of various species, and what are called leaf miners,\r\nbut as these infest almost all kinds of deciduous trees and shrubs,\r\nwe cannot consider them specially injurious to the filberts and\r\nhazels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nHICKORY NUTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHicoria, _Rafinesque_. Name probably derived from the aboriginal or\r\nIndian word hickery, or hickory, the common name for these nuts\r\namong the tribes formerly inhabiting the Middle and Southern\r\nAtlantic States.\r\n\r\n=Order=, _Juglandaceae_ (Walnut family).--Native deciduous trees of\r\nlarge size, with compound serrate leaves with an odd number of\r\nleaflets, varying from five to fifteen in the different species, the\r\nthree terminal ones usually much the largest, the lower ones on\r\nopposite sides of the rather stout leafstalk. Male catkins slender,\r\ncylindrical, pendulous, two to six inches long, three in a cluster,\r\non a naked peduncle or stalk (Fig. 46) springing from the base of\r\nthe terminal buds of the previous season's twigs, and just below the\r\nfirst set of new leaves in spring; calyx unequally three-parted;\r\nstamens three to eight. Female flowers two or more in a cluster,\r\nfrom the end of the new growth of the season, which becomes the\r\ncommon peduncle or fruit-stalk of a single nut or cluster of nuts.\r\nThe flowers are destitute of petals; stigma short, broad, and\r\nfour-lobed; husk fleshy or leathery, smooth, very thick in some\r\nspecies and thin in others, partly or wholly four-lobed, opening in\r\nsome, allowing the nut to drop out at maturity, in others adhering,\r\nfalling off entire when ripe. Nuts with hard, bone-like shell, round\r\nor oblong, smooth or deeply four to six angled, somewhat flattened\r\nor compressed in most of the species; kernel two-lobed, oily, sweet\r\nand delicious, as in the common shellbark hickory, or extremely\r\nbitter, as in the bitter nut.\r\n\r\n=History.=--The early white settlers of the Atlantic States found\r\nthe hickory nut in common use among the Indians, who gathered and\r\nstored them in large quantities in the fall, for food during the\r\nwinter months, and while our ancestors who sought to make homes in\r\nthe western wilderness may have appreciated these luxuries, they\r\nneeded land for cultivation, and to secure it the forests were\r\ndestroyed, with no thought of preserving trees that would yield food\r\nfor themselves or succeeding generations. Not only were the forests\r\ncleared away, as things to be banished from sight and mind, but as\r\nthe hickories yielded superior timber for various agricultural and\r\nother implements, as well as for fuel, they were often sought for\r\nand utilized in advance of the general clearing of wood lands, and\r\nthe first to feel the woodman's axe.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bartram, in the account of his travels through the Southern\r\nAtlantic States, from 1773 to 1778, and published in Philadelphia in\r\n1791, says, in referring to these nuts, that they are held \"in great\r\nestimation with the present generation of Indians, particularly\r\n_Juglans exaltata_, commonly called shellbarked hickory; the Creeks\r\nstore up the latter in their towns. I have seen above an hundred\r\nbushels of these nuts belonging to one family. They pound them to\r\npieces, and then cast them into boiling water, which, after passing\r\nthrough fine strainers, preserves the most oily part of the liquid;\r\nthis they call by a name which signifies 'hickory milk;' it is as\r\nsweet and rich as fresh cream, and is an ingredient in most of their\r\ncookery, especially in hominy and corn cakes.\"\r\n\r\nWe can readily imagine what a delicious liquid hickory milk must be\r\nin which to cook hominy, rice, and similar kinds of grain; and there\r\nwould be no danger from tuberculosis in this natural product of the\r\nvegetable kingdom. Perhaps at some future day, when milch cows are\r\nas rare in this country as they have been for ages in China and\r\nJapan, hickory milk will come into vogue again and be more highly\r\nvalued by our people than it ever was by the aborigines.\r\n\r\nWhile we have no romantic tales to repeat in which either hickory\r\ntrees or the nuts have played an important part, yet we can well\r\nimagine that such delicious food must, in ages past, as well as in\r\nour own times, have been a coveted luxury, enjoyed at many a social\r\ngathering of friends and neighbors. Many a country boy and girl has\r\nwelcomed the early autumn frosts, because they announced the opening\r\nof the nutting season, reminding them of the long winter evenings\r\nnear at hand, and that the industrious and nimble squirrel was a\r\nsharp competitor in the nutting field; consequently, no time could\r\nbe wasted if a store of such luxuries was to be gathered for home\r\nuse, or to be sent to city or village market for the benefit of less\r\nfortunate consumers. It is to be hoped that this source of pleasure\r\nand profit may continue long after the original forests of our\r\ncountry have disappeared, and through the preservation and planting\r\nof the noble food-bearing hickories by the roadsides, in orchards,\r\nalso for shelter, shade and ornament. Valuable as hickory timber and\r\nhickory nuts have always been to the inhabitants of this country, we\r\nmight reasonably suppose that there would be many thousands of these\r\ntrees planted every year, in order to keep up a supply and make good\r\nthe annual loss sustained in the destruction constantly going on in\r\nour forests. But no such plantings appear to have been undertaken in\r\nour Northern States, and only quite recently in the Southern, where\r\nthe pecan nut is attracting considerable attention, on account of\r\nthe increase in demand, and the advance in price obtained for them\r\nin the markets. Furthermore, with the many millions of dollars\r\nexpended by the general government to encourage the planting,\r\npreservation and cultivation of forest trees, no special\r\nencouragement has been extended to the nut-bearing kinds, and the\r\nman who plants a cottonwood or worthless willow is given as much\r\ncredit as though he planted and reared a tree a thousand times more\r\nvaluable to himself and the country at large.\r\n\r\nThis may not be a very creditable phase of nut culture in the United\r\nStates, but it is history, nevertheless, and to attempt to suppress\r\nit would merely be encouraging negligence, which has already become\r\nso general that the inferior varieties of hickory nuts command a\r\nmuch higher price in our markets than the very choicest did a few\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nThe nomenclature of the walnut family has been subjected to various\r\nrevisions by botanists, during the present century, and there are\r\nprobably others yet to follow in the near or distant future. In all\r\nother standard botanical works published prior to 1817-1818, the\r\nhickories were classed with the butternut, black walnut and Persian\r\nwalnut, and under the generic name of _Juglans_. But in the year\r\n1818 Mr. Thomas Nuttall, an eminent English botanist, who had given\r\nyears to wandering through our forests and studying American plants,\r\nseparated the hickories from the older genus of _Juglans_, placing\r\nthem in a new one, to which he gave the name of _Carya_, from an\r\nancient Greek name of the walnut tree. This classification of\r\nNuttall's was immediately adopted by the botanists of his time, and\r\nhas been observed, scarcely without question, by the authors of all\r\nthe numerous botanical works published in America and Europe during\r\nthe past seventy-five years. But now we are informed by some of our\r\nnoted botanists that, in deference to the law of priority dominant\r\nin matters scientific, Nuttall's name for this genus must be\r\nabandoned, inasmuch as Mr. C. S. Rafinesque, an erratic Frenchman\r\npossessing considerable ability for botanical research, and who came\r\nto this country several years before Nuttall,--as some recent\r\ninvestigations appear to prove,--defined the distinct\r\ncharacteristics of the hickories, and not only proposed, but\r\npublished the name _Hicoria_ for this genus in 1817, while Nuttall's\r\n_Carya_ did not appear until one year later, viz.: 1818. For these\r\ndates I am mainly indebted to Dr. N. L. Britton, who appears to have\r\nbeen delving among \"first editions\" of the works of the authors\r\nnamed (Bulletin, Torrey Botanical Club, 1888).\r\n\r\nIt seems strange, however, at this late date, that such eminent\r\nbotanists as the late Dr. John Torrey and Dr. Asa Gray, who were\r\nboth intimately acquainted with, in fact associates of, Rafinesque,\r\nshould have ignored his rights in regard to the name of _Hicoria_,\r\nif he was really entitled to the honor of founding this genus and\r\nseparating the hickories from the _Juglans_. But for some good\r\nreason they left the matter in abeyance, for their successors to\r\nsettle. Dr. Torrey does, in a way, recognize Rafinesque, in his\r\n\"Catalogue of Plants Within Thirty Miles of the City of New York,\"\r\npublished in 1819, but in a manner which shows that he had no\r\nconfidence in Rafinesque's claim, but did approve of Nuttall's\r\nclassifications and name of _Carya_, for on page 74 he refers to the\r\nhickories as follows: \"_Carya_, Nuttall; _Hickoria_, Rafinesque.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this it appears that Dr. Torrey did not adopt _Hicoria_ as the\r\nproper mode of spelling this word, but retained the letter k in\r\ngiving it a Latin form. This is not strange, inasmuch as Rafinesque\r\nhad no settled form of his own, and varied the spelling at different\r\ntimes; as, for instance, _Scoria_, _Hicoria_, _Hickorius_ and\r\n_Hicorius_. It is but reasonable to suppose that Dr. Torrey was\r\nfamiliar with Rafinesque's earlier writings, and also whether his\r\nproposed generic name of _Scoria_, in 1808, was legitimate, or a\r\nmisspelling of _Hicoria_, as suggested by Dr. Britton. But of one\r\nthing we may rest assured, and that is, Dr. Torrey would not\r\nknowingly detract from, nor fail to give every man full credit for\r\nhis labors in any branch of natural history or elsewhere, and he\r\ncertainly must have known Rafinesque in all his eccentricities and\r\nmoods, for when in New York city he was usually the guest of Dr.\r\nTorrey, and these relations continued for many years.\r\n\r\nA few of our leading botanists, having recently decided that\r\nRafinesque's name of _Hicoria_ must be restored, in deference to the\r\nlaws of priority, and Nuttall's _Carya_ be relegated to the position\r\nof a synonym, I have concluded to adopt it in this work, although I\r\nam well aware that a large majority of our botanists have protested\r\nagainst this change, probably because of the confusion it is likely\r\nto cause in the botanical literature of our times. My own reason for\r\nadopting _Hicoria_ is not so much from any special reverence to the\r\nlaws of priority, but because it is derived from an old American\r\nIndian name, and for all such I have a profound regard, and would\r\nretain and adopt them whenever and wherever they are at all\r\nappropriate to products indigenous to this country. The hickories\r\nbeing purely American, and unknown to Greece or Greeks, a\r\nsemi-native name is all the more acceptable. It is not to be\r\nexpected that botanical quibbles are of any special interest to the\r\npractical nut culturist, for a pecan or a shellbark hickory will\r\ntaste just as sweet and command as high a price in market under one\r\nscientific name as another; but the cultivator may have occasion to\r\nlook up the botanical name of his trees in some school botany, or\r\nother botanical work, and fail to find it, in the absence of some\r\nguide to the various changes that have been made in the name of the\r\ngenus, as well as in the name of the synonyms of the different\r\nspecies. Then, again, propagators and dealers in trees are prone to\r\nemploy unfamiliar names, whether they are old or new, this adding to\r\nthe confusion, without benefit to either purchaser or cultivator.\r\n\r\nTo assist those who may have occasion to consult these pages for\r\neither the common or botanical names of the different species of the\r\nhickory, I shall endeavor to give the greater part of those compiled\r\nby Prof. C. S. Sargent (Tenth Census), Dr. Britton, and other\r\neminent authorities whose works I have had occasion to consult in\r\nwriting this treatise. It is not certain, however, that these\r\nrevisions and readjustments of the scientific names of this genus of\r\ntrees will remain undisturbed for any considerable number of years,\r\nfor we have \"many men of many minds\" at work in the line of\r\nbotanical research, and it can scarcely be expected that all will\r\nreach the same conclusion, either in fact or fancy; besides, it is\r\noften difficult, if not wholly impossible, to determine a species\r\nfrom the description given by the earlier botanists, for they are\r\ngenerally very brief and vague, and will often apply equally well to\r\ntwo or more species of the same genus. In some instances not a word\r\nis given in the way of description, merely a name, as in \"Bartram's\r\nTravels\" (1791), where he speaks of _Juglans exaltata_, a\r\ntall-growing hickory found in the region through which he was\r\ntraveling, and we now know that it may have been any one of two or\r\nthree species indigenous to the Southern States.\r\n\r\nUnder such confusing circumstances I shall make no claim of\r\ninfallibility in applying names to species, but attempt no more than\r\nmy predecessors have in the same direction, and my contemporaries\r\nare now attempting, i. e., make as close a guess as possible as to\r\nthe species or variety of hickory which the earlier authors intended\r\nto name and briefly describe. The date of publication of some of the\r\nearlier works consulted are given, as an earnest of my desire to\r\nassent to the law of priority in such matters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45. FOURTEEN YEARS OLD PECAN TREE IN\r\nMISSISSIPPI.]\r\n\r\nPECAN NUT, ILLINOIS NUT (_Hicoria Pecan._ Marshall).--Leaves with\r\nthirteen to fifteen leaflets, oblong-lanceolate, serrate, pointed;\r\nnuts mostly oblong, smooth; husk thin, somewhat four-angled and\r\nfour-valved, these at maturity shrinking, and falling apart when\r\ndropping to the ground. Shell of nut generally thin, smooth or\r\nslightly corrugated, varying widely in both form and size from less\r\nthan one inch in length to nearly or quite two inches, abruptly\r\nblunt, or long and sharp pointed; the two-lobed cotyledon or kernel\r\noily, sweet and delicious. A large, tall, but usually slender tree,\r\nwith smooth or slightly furrowed bark, as seen in Fig. 45. Mainly\r\nindigenous to river bottoms in the Southern and Southwestern States,\r\nextending northward to Indiana, Illinois, Missouri and Southern\r\nIowa.\r\n\r\nSynonyms and their authors:\r\n\r\n  _Juglans Pecan_, Marshall, Arboretum Americanum, 1785.\r\n  _Juglans Pecan_, Walter, 1787.\r\n  _Juglans olivaeformis_, Willdenow, 1809.\r\n  _Carya olivaeformis_, Nuttall, 1818.\r\n  _Juglans Illinoiensis_, Wangenheim, 1787.\r\n  _Juglans angustifolia_, Aiton, Hortus Kewensis.\r\n  _Juglans rubra_, Gaertner.\r\n  _Juglans cylindrica_, Lamarck.\r\n\r\nSHELLBARK OR SHAGBARK HICKORY (_Hicoria alba_. Clayton).--Leaflets\r\nmostly five, occasionally seven, the three upper ones\r\nobovate-lanceolate, the lower pair much smaller and\r\noblong-lanceolate, as shown in Fig. 46, all taper-pointed, finely\r\nserrate, and slightly downy underneath. Terminal buds large and\r\nscaly. Fruit globose, somewhat depressed; husk smooth, very thick,\r\nfirm, scarcely shrinking at maturity, but opening and falling with\r\nthe nuts when ripe. Nuts variable in size, mainly thin-shelled,\r\nwhite, compressed or flattened, four-angled, with deep corrugations,\r\nblunt, rarely sharp-pointed; kernel large, sweet and excellent. One\r\nof the most common and popular of the indigenous edible nuts,\r\ncollected in large quantities as they ripen in autumn, for home use\r\nand for sale, as the demand for this excellent nut is almost\r\nunlimited. A large tree, fifty to eighty feet high, and stem one to\r\nthree feet in diameter, with a shaggy or scaly bark, which on old\r\ntrees may be readily pulled off in long, shell-like plates. Timber\r\nwell known as valuable for many purposes. This species has a very\r\nwide range, of from Maine to Florida in the Eastern States, and\r\nwestward to Minnesota, thence southward through eastern Kansas,\r\nMissouri, Indian Territory and eastern Texas.\r\n\r\nSynonyms:\r\n\r\n  _Juglans alba_, Clayton, Flora Virginica, 1739.\r\n  _Juglans alba ovata_, Miller, Gard.

LEAF AND STERILE CATKINS OF SHELLBARK\r\nHICKORY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47. WESTERN SHELLBARK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48. SECTION WESTERN SHELLBARK.]\r\n\r\nBIG SHELLBARK, THICK OR WESTERN SHELLBARK, ETC. (_Hicoria\r\nlaciniosa._ Michaux).--Leaflets seven to nine, obovate-oblong,\r\nfinely serrate, roughish-downy or pubescent beneath. Buds large,\r\ncomposed of rather loose grayish scales; the young twigs stout, with\r\na gray bark, most noticeable in winter. Fruit large, oval to oblong,\r\nusually four-ribbed above the middle, with depressions between; husk\r\nthick, somewhat spongy, shrinking at maturity, and splitting open\r\nfrom top downward. Nut large, with prominent ridges, and strongly\r\npointed, but slightly compressed at the sides, as seen in Fig. 47;\r\nshell thick and of a dull yellowish color; kernel moderately large,\r\nas shown across section of nut in Fig. 48, but much smaller in\r\nproportion to the size of the nut than in the two preceding species,\r\nbut it is sweet, well flavored, and easily removed from the shell\r\nwhen cracked. The very large size of these nuts makes them a\r\nfavorite, especially where the pecan and the true shellbarks are not\r\nplentiful. These nuts were formerly known as the Springfield or\r\nGloucester nut. A very large tree, sixty to eighty feet high, and\r\ntwo to four feet in diameter, with thick, scaly bark, the scales\r\nsomewhat thicker than in the common shellbark hickory of the\r\nAtlantic States. A rare tree, except in the valleys west of the\r\nAlleghanies, although it is reported to have been found in Chester\r\ncounty, Pennsylvania, and thence west to southern Indiana, Illinois,\r\nMissouri, eastern Kansas, and the Indian Territory. Plentiful in the\r\nbottom lands along the Ohio, Mississippi and lower Missouri.\r\nElliott, in \"Botany of South Carolina and Georgia\" (1824), says it\r\nis rare in the low country of Carolina, but he does not say that it\r\nis found plentiful anywhere in the South. That he was sometimes in\r\ndoubt in regard to the identification of this and other species may\r\nbe inferred from his remark, namely: \"The greater part of our\r\nhickories resemble each other so closely in their leaves and vary so\r\nmuch in their fruit that it is very difficult to discriminate the\r\nspecies.\"\r\n\r\nIt is this difficulty of identification which has led to so much\r\nconfusion in the application of the specific names, for the earlier\r\nbotanists rarely had an opportunity of a close and careful\r\nexamination of the trees or other plants which they attempted to\r\ndescribe. In relation to the species under consideration, we find\r\nthat the specific name of _sulcata_, so long in use, was adopted by\r\nNuttall, from some earlier or contemporaneous author,--a system he\r\nfollowed with all the different species of the hickory, but without,\r\nin some instances, any discrimination or regard to their adaptation\r\nor validity. If there was anything to show that Willdenow (1796) had\r\nthis Western shellbark in mind, or that he or his correspondents in\r\nthis country had ever seen or collected it, then we might adopt the\r\nname of _sulcata_ as the original and true one; but in the absence\r\nof such information, with a full and accurate description of the\r\nspecies and its habitats by Michaux, under the name of _laciniosa_,\r\nI think, in common justice to one of the most eminent dendrologists\r\nwho ever visited this country, the name given should stand as the\r\ntrue one for this species. See Michaux, \"North American Sylva,\" Vol.\r\nI, p. 128.\r\n\r\nSynonyms:\r\n\r\n  _Juglans sulcata (?)_, Willdenow, 1796.\r\n  _Juglans laciniosa_, Michaux, 1810.\r\n  _Carya sulcata_, Nuttall, 1818.\r\n  _Carya cordiformis_, Koch, Dendrologie.\r\n\r\nThe three preceding species are probably the only ones worthy of\r\npropagation for their fruit, or that have and are likely to yield\r\nvarieties of any considerable economic value; but as it is important\r\nthat the nut culturist should know the materials he is using, and\r\nwhether they be of the best or otherwise, I shall admit all the\r\nspecies, without regard to their merits or value for cultivation.\r\n\r\nMOCKER NUT, BULL NUT, BIG-BUD HICKORY, KING NUT, WHITE-HEART\r\nHICKORY, ETC. (_Hicoria tomentosa._ Michaux).--Leaflets mostly\r\nseven, occasionally nine, large, oblong-obovate, rather long\r\npointed, slightly serrate, smooth on both sides while young,\r\nbecoming roughish downy underneath when fully developed in summer;\r\nleaf-stalks and catkins also somewhat downy. Fruit medium to very\r\nlarge, round or ovoid, with a very thick woody husk, which splits\r\nnearly or quite down to the base, but usually falling with the\r\nenclosed nut entire, or bursting open as they strike the ground. Nut\r\nvery thick shelled, smooth, or strongly four to six angled, white at\r\nfirst, but becoming a dull brown when exposed to the light. The\r\nkernel is sweet, but so small and firmly imbedded in the thick shell\r\nthat it is only to be removed in minute sections, but this is\r\nsuccessfully accomplished by the squirrels, who often throw down the\r\nentire crop from large trees before the shells harden, and then pack\r\nthem away in the ground, in old logs, and under the leaves, where\r\nthey will not dry for some weeks or months later. An exceedingly\r\nvariable species, especially in the size and form of the nuts; on\r\nsome trees they are scarcely an inch in diameter, while on others\r\nthey are nearly or quite two inches, but always with such a thick,\r\nhard shell as to be nearly worthless for their meats. The largest of\r\nthese nuts I have ever seen grow in central and western New York,\r\nwhere they are called \"King\" or \"Bull\" nuts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49. LEAF OF PIGNUT.]\r\n\r\nThe trees grow to a very large size, or from sixty to eighty feet\r\nhigh, and two to three feet in diameter, with a thick, deeply\r\nfurrowed bark, not scaly. The wood is white, heavy, tough, and\r\nnearly as valuable as the common shellbark hickory. The terminal\r\nbuds, and especially those on the young seedlings and suckers\r\nspringing up in clearings, are very large, round, short, and covered\r\nwith brownish scales, hence one of the local names of big-bud\r\nhickory.\r\n\r\nA widely distributed species, or from the valley of the St. Lawrence\r\nto Florida, and along the great lakes to Nebraska, and thence\r\nsouthward to Texas. Unlike most of the other hickories, this species\r\nseems to prefer thin soils, rocky sandstone ridges, and here in New\r\nJersey almost disappearing in the rich bottom lands along our creeks\r\nand rivers; at least, this is its habit here in the northern part of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nSynonyms:\r\n\r\n  _Juglans alba (?)_, Linn., 1754.\r\n  _Juglans tomentosa_, Michaux, 1810.\r\n  _Carya tomentosa_, Nuttall, 1818.\r\n  _Carya tomentosa_ var. _maxima_, Nuttall.\r\n  _Carya alba_, Koch, Dendrologie.\r\n\r\nPIGNUT, HOGNUT, BROWN HICKORY, BLACK HICKORY, SWITCH-BUD HICKORY\r\n(_Hicoria glabra._ Miller).--Leaflets five to seven, mostly seven\r\n(Fig. 49), ovate-lanceolate, serrate, smooth; fruit pear-shaped or\r\nroundish-obovate; husk very thin, splitting about half way down into\r\nfour sections or valves, these usually remaining attached to the nut\r\nfor some time after falling, in fact, may often be found within the\r\nhusk all through the winter; shell of nut moderately thin but tough,\r\nwith a small, bitterish-sweet kernel. A large, rather slender tree\r\nin similar and same localities as the last, with a close bark but\r\nnot so deeply furrowed as in the mocker nut (_H. tomentosa_). Of no\r\nspecial value except as a timber tree, and its slow growth makes it\r\nless deserving of attention than those species that bear large and\r\nedible nuts.\r\n\r\nSynonyms:\r\n\r\n  _Juglans glabra_, Miller, 1768.\r\n  _Juglans alba acuminata_, Marshall, 1785.\r\n  _Juglans obcordata_, Lamarck.\r\n  _Juglans porcina_, Michaux.\r\n  _Juglans pyriformis_, Muhlenberg.\r\n  _Juglans porcina_, var. _obcordata_, Pursh.\r\n  _Juglans porcina_, var. _pyriformis_, Pursh.\r\n  _Carya porcina_, Nuttall.\r\n  _Carya glabra_, Torrey.\r\n  _Carya amara_, var. _porcina_, Darby.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50. BITTERNUT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51. BITTERNUT.]\r\n\r\nBITTERNUT, SWAMP HICKORY, PIGNUT (_Hicoria minima._\r\nMarshall).--Leaflets seven to eleven, oblong-lanceolate, serrate,\r\nsmooth and thin; fruit globular, with distinct ridges at the seams\r\n(Fig. 50); the husk very thin, and at maturity splitting about\r\nhalfway to the base, the four divisions becoming reflexed in\r\nmaturing, but not separating and falling apart as in the\r\nthicker-husk species. Nut broadest at the top, sharp-pointed,\r\nobcordata (Fig. 51), slightly depressed; shell very thin, smooth,\r\nwhite; kernel intensely bitter when fully ripe, but greedily eaten\r\nby squirrels when fresh or in a half milky state. Usually a\r\nmedium-sized, graceful tree, with smooth bark, slender twigs, and\r\nsmall, oblong buds covered with a dense yellow pubescence in winter.\r\nIt grows in moist soils, along streams and borders of swamps, and\r\nnear springs on hill-sides, from Maine to Florida, and westward to\r\nMinnesota, Nebraska and Kansas. Humphrey Marshall described this\r\nspecies so accurately in his \"American Grove,\" under the name of\r\n_Juglans minima_, p. 68, that there is no good reason to doubt its\r\nidentity, nor question the validity of this name, which should\r\nremain as the true and original one, and all others of later date be\r\nplaced among the synonyms.\r\n\r\nSynonyms:\r\n\r\n  _Juglans_ (_alba_) _minima_, Marshall, 1785.\r\n  _Juglans cordiformis_, Wangenheim, 1787.\r\n  _Juglans angustifolia_, Lamarck, 1791.\r\n  _Juglans amara_, Michaux, 1810.\r\n  _Hickorius amarus_, Rafinesque, 1817.\r\n  _Carya amara_, Nuttall, 1818.\r\n\r\nNUTMEG HICKORY (_Hicoria myristicaeformis._ Michaux).--Leaflets five\r\nto seven, ovate-lanceolate, pointed, quite smooth on both sides, the\r\nterminal leaflet sessile, not stalked; fruit oval; husk wrinkled and\r\nrough, thick; nut small, oval, short-pointed; the shell furrowed and\r\nvery hard, and of a brownish color marked with white lines. Michaux\r\nsays: \"The shell is so thick that it constitutes two-thirds of the\r\nvolume of the nut, which, consequently, is extremely hard, and has a\r\nminute kernel. It is inferior to the pignut.\"\r\n\r\nA medium-size tree with slender branches, found in a few localities\r\nin South Carolina, near swamps and borders of streams, and westward\r\nto Arkansas, where it reaches its greatest development. This hickory\r\nhas been so rarely seen by botanists that Michaux's specific name,\r\ngiven it more than eighty years ago, has fared a better fate than\r\nthose of our more common and abundant species; consequently, I have\r\nonly one synonym to record, viz.: _Carya amara_, var.\r\n_myristicaeformis_, Cooper, in Smithsonian Report, 1858.\r\n\r\nWATER HICKORY, SWAMP HICKORY, BITTER PECAN (_Hicoria aquatica._\r\nMichaux).--Leaflets nine to thirteen, generally eleven, narrow and\r\nobliquely lanceolate-pointed, slightly serrate, thin and smooth;\r\nfruit globular or somewhat egg-shaped, four-ribbed; husk thin,\r\ndividing at maturity down to the base; nut thin-shelled,\r\nfour-angled; kernel much wrinkled and very bitter. This is closely\r\nallied to if not a more Southern form of our common bitternut. A\r\nsmall tree in swamps and river bottoms from North Carolina south to\r\nFlorida, and west to Texas.\r\n\r\nSynonyms:\r\n\r\n  _Juglans aquatica_, Michaux.\r\n  _Hicorius integrifolia_, Rafinesque.\r\n  _Carya aquatica_, Nuttall.\r\n  _Carya integrifolia_, Sprengel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52. LARGE, LONG PECAN NUT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53. OVAL PECAN NUT.]\r\n\r\n=Varieties of the Hickories.=--Every one who has ever had occasion\r\nto gather or examine hickory nuts in the forest, or has seen them in\r\nmarket, must be aware of the fact that there is an almost endless\r\nvariety of each and all the different species. But as it is only the\r\nvarieties of the pecan and thick- and thin-shelled shagbark\r\nhickories that are likely to be of any economic value to the nut\r\nculturist, all others will be omitted. Of the first or pecan nut the\r\nnatural varieties are not only exceedingly numerous, but vary widely\r\nin size, form, thickness of shell, and productiveness of the\r\nindividual trees. In some the nuts are produced singly or in pairs,\r\nand from this number up to clusters of seven or eight; these\r\nlarge-clustered and extra-prolific varieties are most worthy of\r\nspecial attention, especially when the nuts are of good size and\r\nthin-shelled, as in the large, long pecan (Fig. 52). From this size\r\nthey vary, as shown in Figs. 53, 54, 55. Some of the wild varieties\r\nhave received local names, and a very few propagated by grafting,\r\nwhich is probably the most practical means known of multiplying\r\nthem, and at the same time preserving their varietal\r\ncharacteristics. Choice and extra fine ones are constantly being\r\ndiscovered and brought to notice, and doubtless many more will\r\nfollow as the old fields and forests of the South and West are\r\nexplored; besides, there are many thousands of seedling trees now\r\nunder cultivation, and from these we may expect some marked\r\nvariations from the original or wild forms. In Bulletin 105, of the\r\nNorth Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station for 1894, and in\r\nReport of Assistant Pomologist of U. S. Department of Agriculture\r\nfor same year, we find the following-named varieties of pecans:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54. SMALL OVAL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55. LITTLE MOBILE.]\r\n\r\nALBA.--Size below medium, cylindrical, with pointed apex; cracking\r\nqualities good; shell of medium thickness; corky shell lining thick,\r\nadhering to the kernel; kernel plump, light colored; quality good.\r\n\r\nBILOXI (W. R. Stuart, Ocean Springs, Miss.).--Medium size,\r\ncylindrical, pointed at each end; surface quite regular, light\r\nbrown; shell thin; cracking qualities medium; kernel plump, with\r\nyellowish-brown surface; free from astringency, of good quality, and\r\nkeeps well without becoming rancid. Introduced several years ago by\r\nW. R. Stuart as Mexican Paper Shell, but the name has since been\r\nchanged to Biloxi.\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIAN (W. R. Stuart, Ocean Springs, Miss.).--Large, cylindrical,\r\nsomewhat compressed at the middle, rounding at the base; pointed and\r\nsomewhat four-sided at the crown; shell rather heavy; cracking\r\nqualities medium; quality good. In size and form this nut closely\r\nresembles Mammoth, which was introduced in 1890 by Richard\r\nFrotscher, of New Orleans, La.\r\n\r\nEARLY TEXAN (Louis Biediger, Idlewild, Tex.).--Size above medium,\r\nshort, cylindrical, with rounded base and blunt conical crown; shell\r\nquite thick, shell lining thick, astringent; cracking qualities\r\nmedium; kernel not very plump, of mild, nutty flavor; quality good.\r\n\r\nGEORGIA MELON.--Size above medium, short, rather blunt at apex;\r\ncracking quality medium; shell rather thick; kernel plump, brown;\r\nmeat yellow, moderately tender, pleasant, good.\r\n\r\nGONZALES (T. V. Munson, Denison, Tex.).--Above medium size, with\r\nfirm, clear shell; quality excellent. Originated in Gonzales county,\r\nTex.\r\n\r\nHARCOURT.--Size medium, short, slightly acorn-shaped; cracking\r\nqualities medium; shell rather thick, but very smooth inside; kernel\r\nshort, very plump; meat yellow, very tender, rich, very good.\r\n\r\nLONGFELLOW.--Size medium, oblong, cylindrical, somewhat irregular,\r\nenlarging from base to near crown, then sharply conical to the apex;\r\ncracking qualities not first-class; shell of medium thickness;\r\nkernel plump but rather thin, light-colored; meat white, sweetish,\r\nrich, good.\r\n\r\nPRIMATE (W. R. Stuart, Ocean Springs, Miss.)--Of medium size,\r\nslender, rather long; shell thin; quality good; ripens in September,\r\nthirty days before other nuts.\r\n\r\nRIBERA.--Size above medium, oblong ovate; cracking qualities good;\r\nshell thin; kernel plump, light brown, free from the bitter, red,\r\ncorky growth which adheres to the shell; meat yellow, tender, with\r\nrich, delicate, pleasant flavor.\r\n\r\nFAUST.--A South Carolina variety of medium to large size, medium\r\nshell and good quality.\r\n\r\nFROTSCHER.--A Louisiana variety of large size, very thin shell, and\r\nplump kernel of good quality.\r\n\r\nJEWETT.--From Mississippi; a large, long nut, rather irregular;\r\nshell medium; quality very good.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56. STUART.]\r\n\r\nSTUART.--A large, roundish, oblong nut from Mississippi (Fig. 56).\r\n\r\nTURKEY EGG.--A variety from Florida; large and thin-shelled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57. VAN DEMAN.]\r\n\r\nVAN DEMAN.--A large variety from Mississippi, of oblong form and\r\nthin shell (Fig. 57).\r\n\r\nFrom other sources we collect other names, namely:\r\n\r\nIDLEWILD.--An oval shaped nut from Idlewild, Texas. Report of U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, 1890.\r\n\r\nRISIEN.--A very broad, thick variety, about one inch in diameter,\r\nvery blunt at both ends. From San Saba, Texas (Fig. 58).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58. RISIEN.]\r\n\r\nA peculiar shaped pecan nut is shown in Fig. 59, from Louisiana,\r\nsent under the name of Lady Finger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59. LADY FINGER.]\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the Georgia State Horticultural Society, 1893, we\r\nobtain certain local names without description, as, for instance,\r\nTurkey Egg, Mexican, Colorado, Pride of the Coast, etc. Col. W. R.\r\nStuart, of Ocean Springs, Miss., who has been called the \"father of\r\npecan culture\" in that State, and is the author of \"The Pecan and\r\nHow to Grow it,\" adds two more varieties to the above list, viz.:\r\nBeauty and Columbia; the latter, as figured in the book named, is a\r\nvery large variety, tapering from a broad base to a sharp point.\r\nJudge Samuel Miller, of Bluffton, Mo., found some very large and\r\nfine varieties of the pecan in his neighborhood several years ago,\r\non the farm of a man named Meyers, and he purchased the nuts from\r\nthe tree bearing the largest in the grove and planted them, and the\r\nseedlings have since been distributed under the name of \"Meyers'\r\nPecan.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Miller kindly sent me a quantity of these nuts, from which I\r\nraised some fifty or more trees, and all have thus far been\r\nuninjured by the cold of our severest winters. From my own\r\nexperience in raising pecan trees, and I may add, that of some of my\r\nneighbors, those grown from nuts gathered in the more Southern\r\nStates are almost invariably tender here in the North; but those\r\nraised from thoroughly acclimated trees, along the northern limits\r\nof this species, will give us a hardy race, and probably allow of\r\nextending their cultivation far north of their natural range. Those\r\nwho intend to try pecan culture in the Northern States should bear\r\nthis in mind, and secure nuts and cions from hardy acclimated trees.\r\n\r\n=Varieties of the Shellbark.=--Of this species (_H. alba_) there are\r\nas many distinct natural varieties as of the pecan, and while local\r\nor neighborhood names are plentiful enough, they have not, except in\r\na very few instances, been placed on record in agricultural reports\r\nor other publications. Three small thin-shelled varieties are named\r\nin the Report of the Pomologist of the U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture for 1891, viz.: Milford, Shimar and Leaming, but neither\r\nhas been propagated, and they are probably not worthy of it, because\r\nthere are plenty of larger ones with thin shells which would be far\r\nmore valuable for cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60. THE ORIGINAL HALES' PAPER-SHELL HICKORY\r\nTREE.]\r\n\r\nA careful research extending over a period of a quarter of a century\r\nyields only a solitary instance of the propagation and dissemination\r\nof a variety of the shellbark hickory, and this one is Hales'\r\nPaper-shell, which I named, described and figured in the _Rural\r\nNew-Yorker_, Nov. 19, 1870, p. 382, Vol. XXII. I am thus particular\r\nin regard to time and place, because years hence these facts may be\r\nof more importance than at the present day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61. HALES' HICKORY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62. SECTION OF HALES' HICKORY.]\r\n\r\nThe original tree of this remarkable variety is growing upon the\r\nfarm of Mr. Henry Hales, near Ridgewood, N. J., and on bottom land\r\nwithin a few rods of the Saddle river. The tree is probably more\r\nthan a hundred years old, and is about seventy-five feet high, and\r\nnearly two feet in diameter at the base, and of the shape shown in\r\nFig. 60, taken from a sketch made in the fall of 1894. There are a\r\nlarge number of the shellbark hickories growing near by, and while\r\nthere are several excellent and very large varieties among them, the\r\none I have named is by far the largest and most distinct in form,\r\nand with the thinnest shell; in fact, the shell is much thinner than\r\nin many of the pecan nuts that reach our Northern markets from the\r\nSouth. The size and form of these nuts is clearly shown in Fig. 61,\r\nwhile the thin shell and thick, plump kernel is seen in the\r\ncross-section, Fig. 62. It will be noticed that these nuts differ\r\nfrom the ordinary varieties of this species in the absence of the\r\nsharp ridges and depressions running from base to point, the surface\r\nof the shell being broken up into irregular, wavy lines, somewhat\r\nresembling the shell of the more common varieties of the Persian\r\nwalnuts. I have occasionally seen very similar varieties,--but of\r\nsmaller size,--among the mixed lots of hickory nuts on sale in our\r\ncity markets, also oblong nuts, as shown in Fig. 63, but of course\r\nthere is no way of tracing these to the trees producing them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63. LONG SHELLBARK HICKORY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64. SHELLBARK MISSOURI.]\r\n\r\nAnother merit, in addition to the large size and thin shell of the\r\nHales' Paper-shell, is its keeping qualities, the kernels rarely\r\nbecoming rancid, even when two or more years old, and from a long\r\nacquaintance with this nut and hundreds of other varieties gathered\r\nfrom all parts of the United States, I am inclined to place it at\r\nthe head of the list, and as the most valuable sort as yet\r\ndiscovered. It is true, however, that I have found in the forests,\r\nand also received, many very large and superior nuts of this\r\nspecies, that are well worthy of propagation and cultivation, but\r\nthey have been, in the main, of the typical form, and not of so\r\ndistinct a type as this Paper-shell. Judge Miller sent me a few nuts\r\nof a shellbark found in Missouri, that were even larger, and with\r\nfully as thin shell as that of the Hales' (Fig. 64), but upon making\r\nfurther inquiries in regard to the tree that produced them, I\r\nlearned that an incoming railroad line had destroyed it, and thus\r\none more tree of inestimable value had been sacrificed in the march\r\nof this progressive age.\r\n\r\n=Varieties of the Western Shellbark.=--The typical form of the thick\r\nor Western shellbark (_H. laciniosa_) has already been shown on a\r\npreceding page, but some remarkable and valuable varieties have been\r\nfound in the Western States, and no doubt others will be, when more\r\nattention is paid than at present to the natural food products of\r\nour forests. The tendency of this species, in its variations, is\r\nusually in the direction of an elongation of the nuts, even when\r\nthere is no decrease in the thickness of the shell, as shown in Fig.\r\n65, taken from one of a number of long varieties collected in the\r\nWestern States; and while they do not possess any special merit,\r\nthey attract attention, owing to their unusual form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65. LONG WESTERN SHELLBARK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66. FRESH NUSSBAUMER HYBRID.]\r\n\r\nNUSSBAUMER'S HYBRID.--Several years ago I received a specimen of a\r\nvery remarkable nut from Judge Samuel Miller, of Bluffton, Mo.,\r\nunder the name of \"Nussbaumer's Hybrid Pecan.\" Judge Miller informed\r\nme that he had received it from Mr. J. J. Nussbaumer, Mascoutah, St.\r\nClair Co., Ill., who claimed that it was a hybrid between the pecan\r\nand the large western shellbark hickory (_H. laciniosa_). I had an\r\nillustration made of this specimen, and it appeared, with a brief\r\ndescription, in the _American Agriculturist_ for Dec., 1884, p. 546.\r\nSoon after receiving the specimen nut from Judge Miller I opened\r\ncorrespondence with Mr. Nussbaumer, and learned from him that only\r\none tree bearing such nuts had ever been found, and this was of\r\nlarge size, six and a half feet in circumference, and about fifty\r\nfeet high, the bark somewhat like that of the hickory but nearer the\r\npecan. Mr. Nussbaumer sent me specimens of the green nuts with\r\nleaves and twigs, from the original tree. The nuts, however, of that\r\nseason (1884), were badly infested with the \"hickory-shuck worm\"\r\n(_Grapholitha caryana_, Fitch), and these had so ruined the shucks,\r\nand even eaten into the shells of the nuts, that few of the\r\nspecimens received were fully developed. But from two nuts I had a\r\nsketch made while they were fresh and of natural size, as shown in\r\nFig. 66, the dark, irregular marks on the husks showing where the\r\nshuck worm had attacked them. One of these nuts is shown in Fig. 67,\r\nalso natural size. I planted one of the nuts, from which I now have\r\na tree about ten feet high, but although ten years old it has not\r\nfruited, and, so far as I can judge from its appearance, is a pure\r\nWestern shellbark, with no indication of hybridity; but of course\r\nthis does not prove that the original or parent tree is not a\r\nhybrid, as claimed by Mr. Nussbaumer, Judge Miller, and, if I am\r\nrightly informed, Prof. T. J. Burrill, of the University of\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67. NUSSBAUMER'S HYBRID.]\r\n\r\nHowever widely opinions may differ in regard to the origin of this\r\nvariety, it is certainly a most remarkable nut, and I regret that\r\nthe exact location of the original tree has entirely escaped my most\r\ncareful seeking; and of late years I have been unable to learn\r\nanything of Mr. Nussbaumer, further than that he had moved from\r\nMascoutah to Okawville, Ill., the last letter received from him\r\nbeing dated Dec. 13, 1887. In one of his letters he said that he had\r\nraised a large number of seedlings from this supposed hybrid, and if\r\nthese are still alive they would be of much scientific interest,\r\nespecially if any of them showed the distinct characteristics of\r\neither of the supposed parents.\r\n\r\nIt would certainly be a pity to have such a remarkable nut lost to\r\nthe world, because if propagated by grafting or by any other mode to\r\ninsure perpetuating its varietal characteristics, its value could\r\nscarcely be estimated. The nuts are as thin-shelled as the common\r\npecan, the kernel sweet and good, and in addition, the tree is a\r\nnative of a northern State, and would, no doubt, prove as hardy as\r\nour common shellbark hickories.\r\n\r\nTHE FLOYD PECAN.--This is another supposed-to-be hybrid, and of the\r\nsame species of hickory as the last; but the one nut which I\r\nreceived differed from the Nussbaumer by being somewhat larger, and\r\nthe shell with more prominent ridges and a little thicker. It was\r\nsaid to have been found somewhere in southern Indiana by a Mr.\r\nFloyd, who, believing it to be of great value, refused to give any\r\ninformation likely to aid any one else to locate the original tree,\r\nneither would he part with any of the nuts except the one specimen\r\nwhich eventually came into my hands. Of course all horticulturists\r\nknow that seedlings raised from such freaks among nut trees are far\r\ntoo uncertain to be of much value, but ignorance in such matters\r\noften leads the possessor of an article slightly differing from the\r\nordinary to permit his imagination to warp his good sense.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation of the Hickories.=--The hickories have been so seldom\r\nplanted in our Northern States for any purpose, that anything like a\r\nsystematic cultivation of these trees is a thing almost unknown. Of\r\ncourse there is no good reason why the hickories should not be\r\nmultiplied and cultivated as well as other kinds of trees, but in\r\nsome unknown way the idea became prevalent that these trees could\r\nnot be transplanted with any assurance of success, and this has been\r\nkept alive, either through ignorance or by those whose interest led\r\nthem to encourage the planting of the rapid-growing and easily\r\npropagated kinds, instead of those which, though less profitable to\r\nthe producer, would be of far greater value to the purchaser. It\r\nmust be admitted, however, that the hickories are not so tenacious\r\nof life as the willows, poplars, elms and similar kinds of trees,\r\nrequiring more care in their cultivation if they are to be\r\ntransplanted when of a proper size for setting along roadsides or\r\nelsewhere, for shade and ornament, but they are certainly no more\r\ndifficult to make live than the beech, oak, tulip and various\r\nspecies of the magnolia.\r\n\r\nThe slow growth of the hickories while young is another objection\r\noften urged as a fault of these trees, but there is nothing lost but\r\ntime in waiting, and this passes just as swiftly whether we plant\r\ntrees that may in ten years yield a golden harvest, or nothing but\r\nleaves; besides, the hickories respond as readily to stimulants and\r\ngood care generally as the common fruit trees of our orchards. While\r\nthe farmers of our Northern States are generally quite indifferent\r\nas to what becomes of their old hickory trees, and seldom attempt to\r\npreserve the wild seedlings that spring up in the fields and on the\r\nborders of forests, their fellow countrymen of the Southern States\r\nhave, within the past two or three decades, discovered that they\r\npossess an inexhaustible source of wealth in their common pecan nut.\r\nFormerly these trees were sacrificed whenever a choice piece of\r\ntough timber was wanted, and often merely to secure the entire crop\r\nof nuts without waiting for nature to drop them within reach; but\r\nthe advent of many lines of railroads, steamboats, and other means\r\nof communication with the great cities and their markets, has\r\nchanged this inclination to destroy into one of preservation. The\r\nold pecan trees are not only appreciated as a source of income, but\r\nthousands and tens of thousands of seedlings are now annually raised\r\nand planted, to insure larger returns in the near or distant future.\r\nIn fact, pecan culture has already become an important industry in\r\nseveral of the Southern States, although in point of age it is\r\nlittle more than a fledgling. We have no statistics to show what the\r\nannual crop averages in pounds or bushels, but it must be something\r\nenormous if we make our estimate from the quantities received and\r\ndistributed in the Northern States. But with all the efforts put\r\nforth to secure a supply of these nuts, and the high prices they\r\ncommand at both wholesale and retail, the demand seems to keep well\r\nin advance of the supply, and this will, in all probability,\r\ncontinue as our population increases. In the way of demand, the same\r\nis true with our northern species of the shellbark hickories, which\r\nwere formerly very abundant, but of late years have become rather\r\nscarce, for reasons too obvious to call for any explanation at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn selecting a location for planting and cultivating the hickories,\r\nincluding the pecan, a moist, deep soil is certainly preferable to\r\nany other, especially for the three species and their varieties most\r\npromising for this purpose, because we find them growing wild in\r\nsuch situations and soils. But while these naturally deep, rich and\r\nmoist soils are to be preferred, no one need hesitate to plant\r\nhickories on light, dry, and even poor soils, if they are properly\r\nenriched, or a few shovelfuls of fine old stable manure is\r\nthoroughly mixed with the earth in which the roots are set, and then\r\na mulch applied to the surface to keep the soil moist. Almost any\r\nold waste fibrous material, such as leaves, straw, hay, weeds or\r\ncoarse manure, will answer for mulching newly planted trees, and it\r\nshould be applied to a depth of three or four inches, and renewed\r\nannually, or as often as necessary to prevent the growth of grass or\r\nweeds growing within three or four feet of the stem of the tree. In\r\nall dry climates and soils mulching should be considered an\r\nimportant operation, not to be omitted until the trees are from six\r\nto ten years old, and it may usually be continued a longer time with\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\n=Propagation.=--All the species of the hickory are very readily\r\ngrown from nuts gathered when ripe and planted within a few weeks;\r\nor they may be mixed with or stratified between layers of sand and\r\nlight soil and buried in the open ground for the winter, and the\r\nplanting deferred until the following spring. They are not at all\r\ndelicate and will withstand considerable drying and neglect, and\r\nwill grow, if stored in a cool cellar, without being packed in\r\neither soil, sand or other material. But as I have had no occasion\r\nto determine how much neglect these nuts will withstand, nor to what\r\nextremes of adverse conditions it is safe to subject them, I shall\r\nleave investigation in this direction to others, because in general\r\npractice no valuable seed or plant grows any too readily and freely\r\nto satisfy the cultivator, and for this reason I recommend either\r\nplanting hickory nuts in the fall, or burying them between layers of\r\nlight soil or sand, sifting out and planting early the following\r\nspring. If any considerable quantity is to be planted they should be\r\ndropped three or four inches apart in shallow trenches and covered\r\nabout two inches deep. The distance between the rows may be from two\r\nto three feet, depending upon the implements to be used in their\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nThe soil for a seedbed should, of course, be made rich and deep, or\r\nthe same as recommended for chestnuts, and all the means usually\r\nemployed to assist the growth of cultivated plants are applicable to\r\nnut trees. I may also add that cutworms, white grubs and other\r\nnoxious insects are enemies of nut-tree seedlings as well as garden\r\nvegetables. The seedling hickories should be treated as advised for\r\nchestnuts; that is, dug up when one or, at the latest, two years\r\nold, and their central or taproot shortened to at least one-half\r\ntheir original length, and then reset in nursery rows, and at a\r\ndistance of twelve to fifteen inches apart in the row. If grown in\r\nordinary upland, the transplanted seedlings will make a better\r\ngrowth if heavily mulched than under the usual system of clean\r\ncultivation, and it is usually less expensive; besides, by keeping\r\nthe surface of the soil cool and moist, we encourage and assist the\r\nproduction of fibrous lateral roots, which, as a rule, are none too\r\nabundant on seedling hickories, no matter under what conditions or\r\nsystem of cultivation they are raised.\r\n\r\nWhen the seedlings have grown in the nursery rows two or three\r\nyears, they will probably be large enough for planting where they\r\nare to remain permanently; but if, for any reason, they are not\r\ndisposed of, then they should be again transplanted,--the larger\r\nroots shortened,--and re-set in good rich soil. The object of\r\ntransplanting is to insure the production of small fibrous roots,\r\nand a frequent renewal of the same, close to the main stem or stock,\r\nas long as the trees remain in the nursery, whether this be two or\r\ntwenty years. This is somewhat of an expensive operation, but the\r\nvalue of stock thus handled is enhanced far more than the cost of\r\nsuch transplanting, and purchasers are, or at least should be,\r\nwilling to pay a fair price for such trees.\r\n\r\nIt is the natural habit of the hickories, as well as many other\r\nkinds of deciduous trees, to produce in their earlier stages of\r\ngrowth rather large, deeply penetrating, naked roots, with few small\r\nfibers, and in this condition they are not so readily and\r\nsuccessfully transplanted as the kinds possessing a more ramified\r\nroot system. This, perhaps, has misled many persons to believe that\r\ncertain kinds of trees, like the hickories, could not be moved at\r\nall, or at least not with any assurance of being made to live. This\r\nidea has become so prevalent among inexperienced cultivators, and, I\r\nregret to add, often reiterated by theorists, that it has\r\ndiscouraged many who otherwise would have raised and planted nut\r\ntrees in preference to other kinds.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that it is the general habit of most kinds of forest trees\r\nto produce deeply penetrating taproots, when grown from seed, it\r\nproves nothing more than that these parts may be of some importance\r\nto the plants while they are young, and under natural conditions,\r\nyet they are not absolutely necessary, and, at most, are only\r\ntemporary organs, like the tails of tadpoles, always disappearing\r\nwith maturity.\r\n\r\nAny one at all observing, and having had an opportunity of examining\r\nlimited or extended areas of forest trees thrown over by hurricanes,\r\nmust have noticed that no tree of any considerable size and age\r\npossessed a taproot, but had been for years kept in its upright\r\nposition by lateral brace-roots, and through these it had also\r\nobtained nutriment from the surface soil. Some of my correspondents\r\nin the South have expressed their surprise at not finding any trace\r\nof the original central roots on old pecan trees, when blown over by\r\nsevere wind storms. But it is the same everywhere with forest trees\r\nand where the soil is naturally loose and moist: the principal or\r\nsupporting roots spread out widely and remain near the surface, and\r\nthe central roots or taproots disappear much earlier than in dry\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nIn multiplying trees under artificial conditions, we remove the\r\ntaproots, not only for convenience in transplanting, but also to\r\nhasten and increase the production of surface lateral roots, and\r\nmore than this, we lessen the years of luxuriant sterility, securing\r\nearlier fruiting by such operations as root pruning and frequent\r\ntransplanting.\r\n\r\n=Budding and Grafting.=--I have never known of an instance of\r\nsuccessful budding of the hickory, at least in the ordinary way\r\nduring the summer months. What is called \"annular budding\" in early\r\nspring with buds of the previous season, is said to have been\r\nsuccessfully practiced with the pecan at the South, but this mode of\r\npropagation is more of the nature of grafting than of what is\r\nusually understood as budding. But I have been unable to obtain any\r\nstatistics in regard to the proportion of buds that any propagator\r\nor experimenter has made live by this or other modes of propagation.\r\nCol. Stuart says, in \"The Pecan,\" p. 45, \"There is a method known as\r\n'annular budding,' which proves quite successful.\" He then proceeds\r\nto describe the operation, as given in all works on the propagation\r\nof trees and plants during the past hundred years or more, but not a\r\nword to indicate what he considers a \"success,\"--whether it be once\r\nor fifty times in a hundred, or if he ever succeeded in making an\r\nannular bud unite to the stock; I am more inclined to think that he\r\nnever did, than otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn Bulletin No. 105, \"Nut Culture for North Carolina,\" issued from\r\nthe N. C. State Experiment Station, 1894, Mr. W. A. Taylor,\r\nAssistant Pomologist U. S. Department of Agriculture, in referring\r\nto budding and grafting of these trees, says: \"These latter\r\noperations are less successful with the pecan than most fruit trees,\r\nthough they are by no means impossible to accomplish. On seedlings\r\none or two years old annular budding in early summer succeeds best.\"\r\nBut here again we are left in doubt in regard to what the writer\r\nconsiders \"a success.\" Then, again, the line between the \"possible\"\r\nand \"impossible,\" in horticultural matters, is a rather difficult\r\none to determine, and Mr. Taylor fails to cite a single instance in\r\nwhich either annular or any other form of either budding or grafting\r\nhad been successfully practiced. The Bulletins issued from the\r\nDivision of Pomology of the Department of Agriculture, give us no\r\ninformation whatever on this subject of propagation of the\r\nhickories, further than to repeat the old formulas of annular,\r\nsplice and cleft grafting; but as to results they have always been\r\nprovokingly silent.\r\n\r\nHaving been repeatedly assured, by men who presumed to know, that\r\nthe pecan tree was successfully propagated in the South by grafting,\r\nand many thousands annually raised in this way, it seems strange\r\nthat such plants are so rarely offered by nurserymen. Seedlings of\r\nchoice varieties are, of course, abundant enough, but a man might,\r\nwith as much propriety, offer seedling Bartlett pears or Baldwin\r\napples, as pecan trees, expecting to perpetuate varieties. In\r\ncorresponding with Mr. P. J. Berckmans, of the Fruitland Nurseries\r\nof Augusta, Ga., whose experience and acquaintance with the fruits\r\nof the South are, without doubt, in advance of any other\r\nhorticulturist of the past or even the present generation, in reply\r\nto my request for information on grafting pecans, he writes: \"For\r\nthe past five or six years we have grafted various varieties of the\r\npecan nuts. I do not know of any other nurseryman South who offers\r\ngrafted trees. I presume the reason of this is, the great difficulty\r\nin having the grafts take, as we seldom have more than fifteen to\r\ntwenty-five per cent. grow. We usually crown graft in February,\r\nusing one-year-old seedlings grown in nursery rows. Owing to the\r\nsmall percentage of grafts which grow, grafted trees must,\r\nnecessarily, be quite expensive, and for this reason there are so\r\nfew attempts made in this method of propagation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Berckmans makes no reference to annular budding of the pecan, so\r\nstrongly and frequently recommended by the several writers already\r\nquoted, although I am certain that he is as familiar with this mode\r\nof propagation as any one else, and would have practiced it had he\r\nfound it in any way superior to crown grafting. From all that I have\r\nbeen able to learn through a rather extended correspondence, in\r\nregard to the propagation of the pecan nut tree in the South, I\r\nconclude that they are occasionally and sparingly grafted, but with\r\nsuch indifferent results that they are not at all numerous in either\r\norchards or nurseries.\r\n\r\nFrom certain remarks of Col. Stuart, in his essay on \"Pecan\r\nCulture,\" I infer that he has sold grafted trees, for he says:\r\n\r\n    \"It costs no more to care for the grove of choice trees than of\r\n    poor ones; then, again, the grafted or budded ones come into\r\n    profitable bearing three years earlier than seedlings. Here is a\r\n    case in point: Last November (1892) we paid, in cash, two\r\n    hundred and forty-eight dollars for the nuts which grew upon one\r\n    tree, the crop of one year. The tree is twenty inches through at\r\n    its base, and forty-five feet high; such a size tree would grow\r\n    in twenty or twenty-five years. Now small nuts from the same\r\n    size tree will sell for not more than fifteen to twenty dollars.\r\n    Another tree only ten years old bore thirteen and a half dollars\r\n    worth. These choice nuts are such as we grow seedlings from; we\r\n    sell a great many more seedlings than we do grafted or budded\r\n    trees, simply because they are so much cheaper, and people in\r\n    general do not realize that such a vast difference exists\r\n    between the profits of seedling and grafted or budded trees; but\r\n    such is the case, and such it will always remain for aught we\r\n    can see.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after I published the description of the Hales' Paper-shell\r\nhickory in 1870, requests for cions were received from nurserymen\r\nand many amateur horticulturists, who were anxious to try their\r\nskill in grafting this excellent variety. Mr. Hales generously\r\nresponded, and sent cions to a large number of correspondents in\r\nvarious parts of the country, because he was desirous of having the\r\nvariety preserved and propagated. During the following ten years the\r\nold original tree was kept pretty well pruned, in filling orders for\r\ncions; those sent to nurserymen were to be raised on shares,\r\none-half of all the successfully grafted trees to be returned to Mr.\r\nHales. Being a near neighbor, my opportunities for keeping informed\r\nas to the result of this arrangement was all that I could desire. To\r\none nursery firm in central New York Mr. Hales sent about one\r\nthousand cions per annum for four successive years, and in return\r\nreceived just four feeble grafted plants as his share of the total\r\nproduct of the four thousand cions. But as the four plants received\r\nsoon died, he closed that account as one of total loss. Previously,\r\nhowever, he had sent a quantity of cions to Mr. J. R. Trumpy, of the\r\nKissena Nurseries, Flushing, N. Y., whose skill as a propagator of\r\nligneous plants is probably second to that of no man in this\r\ncountry; the result proved that our faith in the man was not\r\nmisplaced, for Mr. Hales received for his share of the experiment\r\nsomething over two dozen grafted trees, and most of these are now\r\nhandsome specimens ten to twenty feet high. Just what percentage of\r\nthe cions set were made to unite and grow I have not been informed,\r\nbut the experiment was, doubtless, rather unsatisfactory as a\r\ncommercial transaction.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the plants sent to Mr. Hales, there have been quite a\r\nnumber distributed among the customers of the nurseries named;\r\nconsequently, we are pretty well assured of the perpetuation of this\r\nremarkably fine variety, even when the original tree succumbs to old\r\nage, or should it be accidentally destroyed. I am inclined to give\r\nMr. Trumpy credit for being the first man to graft the shellbark\r\nhickory in this or any other country, and make the cions unite and\r\ngrow, for I have failed to find any instance of success in this mode\r\nof propagating these trees, prior to his with the Hales'\r\nPaper-shell.\r\n\r\nIn reply to a note sent him a few months since, asking: \"How did or\r\ndo you graft the hickories?\" he replied as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"I put the hickory stocks in pots in the spring, and graft them\r\n    the following spring, say in April, and in the house. The cions\r\n    are cut during the winter, so as to keep them in good order\r\n    until wanted for use. I find it is better to operate in April\r\n    than earlier in the winter. I also graft them out of doors about\r\n    the beginning of May, when the stocks are growing. They will\r\n    succeed very well out of doors, provided the stocks are large\r\n    enough for the cions. Any kind of grafting will do, but crown\r\n    grafting is the best. I have not done much of late in the way of\r\n    grafting hickories in the nursery, not having suitable stocks;\r\n    besides, when the weather becomes warm enough for outside work,\r\n    vegetation pushes far too rapidly to give a man a chance to do\r\n    much of this kind of grafting.\"\r\n\r\nSince the above was written and while these pages were being put in\r\ntype, Mr. Jackson Dawson, of the Arnold Arboretum, Jamaica Plain,\r\nMass., has given his method of grafting the hickories, in _Garden\r\nand Forest_, Feb. 19, 1896, as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"My method,\" writes Mr. Dawson, \"has been to side-graft, using a\r\n    cion with part of the second year's wood attached, binding it\r\n    firmly and covering it with damp sphagnum until the union has\r\n    been made. The best time I have found for the operation under\r\n    glass has been during February, and the plants have been kept\r\n    under glass until midsummer, and wintered the first year in a\r\n    cold frame. In all the genera I find certain species which may\r\n    be called free stocks,--that is, stocks which take grafts more\r\n    readily than others. Thus, nearly all the oaks will graft\r\n    readily on _Quercus Robur_; the birches will graft more easily\r\n    on _Betula alba_ than on others; so of the hickories,\r\n    observation has led me to believe that the best stock is the\r\n    bitternut, _Hicoria minima_. This species grows almost twice as\r\n    rapidly as the common shagbark hickory, and while young the\r\n    cambium is quite soft. I should advise anyone who wishes to\r\n    propagate hickories on a large scale to grow stocks of this\r\n    species in boxes not more than four inches deep. In this way all\r\n    the roots can be saved and there will be no extreme taproot, and\r\n    when shaken out of the boxes the plants are easily established\r\n    in pots and ready for grafting. If taken up in the ordinary way\r\n    from the woods, it requires almost two years to get them well\r\n    rooted, and often the stocks die for want of roots after the\r\n    grafts have really taken. If grown in rich soil, the stocks will\r\n    be large enough to use in one or two years. I should then pot\r\n    them early in the fall, keeping them from heavy frosts, and\r\n    bringing them into the house about the first of January, and as\r\n    soon as they begin to make roots. I should side-graft them close\r\n    to the collar and plunge them in sphagnum moss, leaving the top\r\n    bud of the graft out to the air. The graft ought to be well\r\n    united about the last of March, when the plants should be taken\r\n    from the sphagnum and set in the body of the house to finish\r\n    their growth.\"\r\n\r\nAll who have had any experience in the propagation of trees by\r\ngrafting in spring, are well aware of the flight of time, in the\r\nhurry of work that must be done in a few days or not at all. It is\r\ntrue that the season for grafting may be prolonged or extended a\r\nlittle by cutting the cions in winter and storing them in a cool,\r\nmoist place, where they remain dormant after vegetation has started\r\nin the open air; but this does not affect the stocks, and these may\r\ncome on slowly or rapidly, varying with the seasons, and the grafter\r\nmust not only watch for opportune moments, but take his chances of\r\nstriking the right time and conditions, in order to be successful.\r\nWith such hard wood trees as the hickories it is better to be a\r\nlittle ahead of time than a few days too late, for frosts, and even\r\nquite a severe freeze, will not injure a dormant cion, and under the\r\nmost favorable conditions the union between stock and cion is a\r\nrather slow process. For this reason I advise giving as much time as\r\npossible, and while I do not claim to having had any personal\r\nexperience as a grafter, in the South, still I am inclined to think\r\nthat grafting in the fall, and not later than December, would be\r\npreferable to later in winter or spring. By giving the cion and\r\nstock two or three months in which to form granulations and\r\ncohesion, there would be more certainty of success. Of course, I now\r\nrefer to what is called crown grafting on the root below the surface\r\nof the ground, and when the cion is fixed in place with the usual\r\nligatures of waxed paper or cloth, the soil is drawn back into place\r\nand the cion entirely covered with it, but very lightly over the\r\nterminal bud.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68. CROWN GRAFTING ON ROOTS OF THE HICKORY.]\r\n\r\nWhere small stocks are not at hand, the roots of large trees may be\r\nsevered and the end partly lifted towards the surface, as shown in\r\nFig. 68, and when grafted, allowed to remain in position until the\r\nfollowing season, and then taken up entire or with roots enough to\r\ninsure future growth. The same or a similar process may be practiced\r\nto propagate a choice variety of the hickory, and a mere severing of\r\nthe roots will insure the production of suckers from near the\r\nsevered end, as shown in Fig. 69.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69. SPROUTS FROM SEVERED HICKORY ROOTS.]\r\n\r\nIn grafting isolated stocks in this way, a small or large stake\r\nshould be placed by the side of each, to indicate their position,\r\nand also protect them from being trampled upon. I make this\r\nsuggestion because, in my own experience, it has often proved\r\nsuccessful with various kinds of hard-wooded trees and shrubs that\r\nfailed when grafted in the spring. Here in the North it is rather\r\ndifficult, as well as expensive, to protect cions set in the open\r\nground in the fall; but in the South it is different, and a handful\r\nof almost any coarse litter would be sufficient to prevent severe\r\nfreezing.\r\n\r\nBut grafting in the fall in the open ground is unnecessary, where\r\nsmall seedling stocks are used in the propagation of any kind of\r\ntree; in fact, nurserymen do very little grafting of this kind in\r\nspring, for they learned, by long experience, that the most\r\neconomical and certain method of multiplying such trees is to take\r\nup the stocks in the fall, and then graft them indoors during the\r\nwinter, having stocks and cions stored in cool cellars or pits,\r\nwhere they will be readily accessible when wanted. Apples, pears,\r\nquinces, grapes, and many other kinds of hardy trees, shrubs and\r\nvines are now extensively propagated by grafting during the winter\r\nmonths, and I do not know of any good reason why the hickories and\r\nother closely allied nut trees should not be multiplied in this way.\r\nI have tried it, on a limited scale, with the shellbark hickories,\r\nand with fair success, and in my opinion it is the only way by which\r\nthe hickories, including the pecan, can be multiplied cheaply enough\r\nto become of commercial importance.\r\n\r\nThe small stocks of one or two years old should be taken up in the\r\nfall, and then crown grafted any time from December to March in the\r\nNorthern States, but the earlier the better; then pack away the\r\ngrafted stocks in moss or soil, in a cool cellar, or heel-in\r\nelsewhere, as, for instance, in pits or frames, where they will not\r\nbe frozen, and yet cool enough to prevent active growth.\r\n\r\nIn the spring the grafted stocks should be planted out in nursery\r\nrows, and deep enough to have the top of the cion just level with\r\nthe surface after the soil has been settled about it by a shower or\r\nheavy rains. The plants must be handled with care, so as not to\r\ndisturb the cions. Mulching will, of course, be beneficial in dry\r\nseasons, and especially if the stocks are set in ordinary\r\nwell-drained soils. In selecting wood for cions, twigs of the\r\nprevious season's growth are usually preferred, but it is not\r\nnecessary, nor is it advisable to discard all except the extreme end\r\nof the shoot or that containing a terminal bud, as some writers have\r\nadvised, to prevent rapid loss of moisture by evaporation, for a\r\ndrop of wax will seal the end of a cion as thoroughly and\r\neffectually as a natural bud; besides, the lower part of the annual\r\ntwigs is often more firm and really better for grafting than the\r\nupper and less sturdy wood, and the lateral buds on it will push\r\njust as readily as the terminal one. The cion may be three or four\r\ninches long, and contain two or more buds. The sealing of the upper\r\nend of a cion that is not protected by a terminal bud is certainly\r\nimportant with all of the hickories, for in this genus of trees the\r\npith is large and continuous, not intersected or cut off by a thin\r\npartition of wood at the joints, as seen in many trees, shrubs and\r\nvines. This large and continuous pith in the hickories is another\r\nreason why the cions succeed best if set below the crown and in or\r\non the fleshy roots having no pith. They may be set on one side, as\r\nin splice grafting, or in the center, or in a cleft made for their\r\nreception with a sharp knife, then bound with waxed paper, or\r\nwrapped with bass, raffia, or other similar material, and afterwards\r\ncovered with melted wax to exclude air and water from the joints and\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\nIn this mode of grafting hickories it is not necessary to employ the\r\nentire root or stock, if it is of large size, for a single cion; for\r\npieces of from six to twelve inches long, containing a few lateral\r\nfibers, will answer the purpose, and it will be found, in practice,\r\nthat these sections of the large fleshy roots contain so much\r\nvitality that, if the cions set in them fail to grow, they will\r\nthrow up sprouts from adventitious buds during the ensuing summer.\r\nAlmost any fair-sized piece of root left in the ground, when digging\r\nup hickory trees large or small, is pretty certain to throw up\r\nsprouts, this not only showing their great vitality, but that\r\npropagation by root cuttings is perfectly practicable and may be\r\nutilized whenever and wherever it may be desirable. The man who\r\nattempts to raise hickories from root cuttings must have patience,\r\nfor very frequently the cuttings will remain apparently dormant in\r\nthe ground one entire season before the sprouts appear above the\r\nsurface. I will also add that this slow or retarded germination\r\nfrequently occurs with the nuts, especially if they have become\r\nsomewhat dry before planting.\r\n\r\nFor commercial purposes root-grafting small stock, as described,\r\nduring the fall and winter, gives promise of being the best and most\r\npracticable system of multiplying varieties; but there is much yet\r\nto be learned in regard to details, and hundreds of carefully\r\nconducted experiments may be necessary to determine the exact time,\r\ncondition and mode of operation. It may be that very early grafting\r\nis better than late, or that we have not, as yet, found the best\r\nspecies for stocks, and that a half-ripened one will be preferable\r\nto one fully matured. Neither has it, as yet, been determined what\r\nkind of material is best in which to store the grafted roots: sand,\r\nsoil or sphagnum (moss) from the swamps; or whether they should be\r\nkept very moist, or comparatively dry; very cold, or moderately\r\nwarm. Here is a wide field for experiments, and a most interesting\r\none; for the successful propagation of the hickories by any mode\r\nthat will insure the perpetuation and rapid multiplication of\r\nvarieties, means millions of dollars added to the wealth of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n=Age of Fruiting.=--We hear much of the precociousness of pecan\r\ntrees in the South, and many are reported as coming into bearing at\r\nthe age of six to ten years from the time of planting the nut; but\r\nthese are probably exceptional instances of early fruiting and not\r\nthe rule, although in a favorable soil and climate it is to be\r\nexpected that such trees will push forward more rapidly than under\r\nless favorable conditions. Grafted trees will, of course, produce\r\nfruit in less time than seedlings, and as this mode of propagation\r\nbecomes more general, and repeated in a direct ancestral line, the\r\ncions for each successive generation of trees being taken from\r\nmature or bearing specimens, the precocious and productive habit\r\nwill eventually become intensified, as it has been in all of our\r\nlong-cultivated fruit trees propagated by artificial methods. We\r\nhave so intensified the productiveness of many kinds of cultivated\r\nfruits by selection, that it has become more of a fault, than a\r\nmerit to be encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe nut trees are amenable to the same physiological laws as other\r\nkinds, and in their propagation by grafting with cions from bearing\r\nspecimens we hasten maturity in the offspring. This has been fully\r\ndemonstrated in many varieties of the Persian walnuts and European\r\nchestnuts. Here in the Northern States we have had so little\r\nexperience with grafted hickories of any species, that really\r\nnothing is yet known as to how they will respond to this mode of\r\npropagation, further than that they grow rapidly and give promise of\r\nbeing fruitful. Seedling trees are, as a rule, of slow growth,\r\nrarely attaining a bearing age and size under twenty years, and with\r\nthe shellbarks thirty or forty years usually pass before anything\r\nlike a crop of nuts is gathered. Something may be gained, in the way\r\nof time, by frequent transplantings and pruning, but more by\r\ngrafting seedlings from old and mature trees. Two grafts of the\r\nHales' hickory commenced bearing at the age of sixteen years.\r\n\r\n=Planting for Profit.=--There are, doubtless, many thousands of\r\nacres of half-denuded woodlands in almost every State in the Union,\r\nboth North and South, that could be readily utilized for growing\r\nhickory timber, and much of such lands is almost useless for other\r\npurposes; but timber culture and forestry is a subject which I have\r\ndiscussed elsewhere,[1] while the object of this work is to aid my\r\nreaders in producing something that may be utilized as food. When\r\nthe hundreds and thousands of miles of our public highways are\r\nshaded with hickory and other nut-bearing trees of the best species\r\nand varieties, it will be time enough to begin planting such kinds\r\nelsewhere. As roadside trees they cannot fail to be profitable,\r\nlargely enhancing the value of adjoining land; for in addition to\r\nbeing equally as ornamental as other kinds, they yield fruit always\r\nin demand at remunerative prices. The three species of the hickory\r\nand their varieties recommended for cultivation all thrive best in\r\nmoist soils, but by occasional watering or thorough mulching they\r\nwill succeed almost anywhere, especially in naturally dry locations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Practical Forestry.]\r\n\r\n=Insect Enemies.=--The hickories, as with all other nut-bearing\r\ntrees, have numerous insect enemies, but these are neither so\r\nnumerous nor destructive as to seriously interfere with their growth\r\nin general, or with their productiveness. Insects may occasionally\r\nbecome exceedingly numerous in certain localities for a few years,\r\nthen suddenly or slowly disappear; but this we must expect, as one\r\nof the coexisting phases of all agricultural pursuits.\r\n\r\nCollectively the hickories have no considerable number of\r\ndestructive insect enemies, but if we count all the species of the\r\nvarious orders that have been found occasionally, or otherwise,\r\nfeeding on the leaves, buds, fruit, twigs, bark, or boring in the\r\nsolid wood, they make a very formidable list of names, or about one\r\nhundred and seventy-five in all; but fully ninety per cent. of these\r\ndepredators are scarcely known, except to a few professional\r\nentomologists, and unless they become more destructive in the future\r\nthan they are at present, or have been in years past, nut culturists\r\nhave little to fear from their depredations. Among the most common\r\nspecies of insects injurious to the hickory, the following may prove\r\nmost annoying to the cultivator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.]\r\n\r\nTHE HICKORY-TWIG GIRDLER (_Oncideres cingulatus._ Say).--A small\r\nyellowish-gray beetle, a little less than an inch long, usually\r\nappearing in this latitude during August, the females depositing\r\ntheir eggs in the twigs of from a quarter to a half-inch in\r\ndiameter. On old large trees the loss of a few or many of these is\r\nscarcely noticed; but on young seedlings or grafted stock it is\r\nquite a different affair, for on such plants the females usually\r\nselect the leader in preference to the lateral twigs in which to\r\ndeposit their eggs. The female girdles the twigs for the purpose of\r\nproviding proper and acceptable food for her progeny; that is, first\r\nthe green, then the slowly drying, then the perfectly hard, seasoned\r\nhickory or whatever kind she may have attacked. Selecting a suitable\r\ntwig, she rests upon it, usually with head downward (Fig. 70), and\r\nwith her mandibles cuts out a ring of bark about one-twelfth of an\r\ninch wide, and deep enough to reach the firm wood underneath. The\r\nplace selected for this annular incision may be only a few inches\r\nfrom the terminal bud, or a foot below it, and in some instances she\r\nwill cut two incisions on the same twig some distance apart, but\r\nusually there is only one on a twig. While cutting this incision she\r\nwill sometimes rest long enough from her labors to deposit an egg in\r\nthe bark above. The number of eggs she deposits in the twig is\r\nprobably variable, but three full-grown grubs is the most I have\r\never found, and the larger proportion examined had only one. This\r\ngirdling of the twig prevents the flow of sap, and the leaves soon\r\nwither and drop off, and the bark and wood shrivel and become hard\r\nand dry; but in the meantime the eggs have hatched and the minute\r\ngrubs have bored their way through the soft bark and reached the\r\npith, feeding in this while acquiring size and strength of jaws that\r\nwill enable them to consume more solid food later and during the\r\nsucceeding winter, spring and summer. Some do not reach maturity\r\nuntil the second summer; at least, in this latitude, as I have found\r\nafter very careful observation and while collecting many hundreds of\r\nspecimens. I will say, however, that this insect is usually referred\r\nto by entomologists as rather rare, and in general it is, but some\r\nyears ago, in an old clearing near by where there was a great number\r\nof young hickory seedlings and sprouts, it was for a season or two\r\nvery abundant; then it suddenly disappeared, and I have not taken a\r\nhalf-dozen specimens since. The grubs bore out the wood in the\r\ninfested twig, and in most instances so completely as to leave only\r\na thin shell of the wood or bark, by the time they have reached\r\nmaturity and are ready to pass into their imago or perfect-winged\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nThis species of twig girdler also attacks the apple, pear,\r\npersimmon, elm, and other kinds of trees, and with those like the\r\napple, with a soft and brittle wood, the girdled twigs are\r\nfrequently broken off by the winds; but this rarely occurs with the\r\nhickories, and we can usually find the stumps remaining on the trees\r\nyears after the beetles have emerged. The only way to keep this pest\r\nin check is to cut off and burn the girdled twigs any time before\r\nthe larvae have reached maturity, and as the girdled dead twigs are\r\nreadily seen, the gathering is not difficult, from medium-sized\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nTHE PAINTED HICKORY BORER (_Cyllene pictus._ Drury).--This is,\r\nperhaps, one of the most common and widely distributed of all the\r\nhickory borers, but, so far as my observations have extended, it\r\nrarely attacks young or healthy trees of any age; in fact, I have\r\nnever found it in or about growing trees, but I have seen it, by the\r\nthousands, breeding in decaying specimens and in hickory cordwood\r\ncut during the winter months and ranked up in shady places. A\r\nhickory tree cut down in fall or winter, and left on the ground or\r\ncut up into cordwood, is pretty sure to attract this borer early in\r\nspring, the females swarming over the bark, depositing their eggs\r\nupon it, and by the ensuing autumn the wood will be fairly\r\nhoneycombed if this insect is at all abundant. The general color of\r\nthe beetle is black, and the size as shown in Fig. 71. There are\r\nthree narrow, whitish bands across the top of the thorax, and one\r\nslightly broader band at the extreme point of the wing-covers; but\r\nthe next band is in the form of an inverted V; the point of the\r\n[Inverted V] does not quite touch the broad lateral band, as in the\r\nclosely allied species known as the locust borer (_C. robiniae_),\r\nwith which it is often confounded; besides, in the latter the\r\nmarkings are of a deep yellow, and not white or of a faint yellowish\r\ntinge. The hickory borer always appears in spring, and the locust\r\nborer in the fall, not later than September in this part of the\r\ncountry. Below or behind the V-shaped band there are three others,\r\nbut all broken up into mere dots, and not continuous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71. HICKORY BORER.]\r\n\r\nIn the South, and especially in Texas, there is a somewhat smaller\r\nbut closely allied species (_Cyllene crinicornis_) that attacks the\r\npecan tree and its wood in the same way as our common hickory borer,\r\nbut in the Southern or Southwestern species the bands on the\r\nwing-covers are all interrupted or broken up into small white spots\r\nor dots. I have no remedy to suggest, further than to cut down old,\r\ninfested trees, and to haul the wood out into the sun and spread it\r\nout where it will quickly dry and become seasoned. If the felled\r\ntree and wood is stripped of its bark as soon as cut, the female\r\nbeetles will not deposit their eggs upon it.\r\n\r\nThere are other long-horned beetles (_Cerambycidae_) that are\r\noccasionally found breeding in the hickories, and among these may be\r\nnamed the Belted Chion (_Chion cinctus_), Tiger Goes (_Goes\r\ntigrinus_), Beautiful Goes (_Goes pulchra_), and the Orange Sawyer\r\n(_Elaphidion inerme_), but they are usually quite too rare to be\r\nconsidered as very destructive insects.\r\n\r\nHICKORY-BARK BORER (_Scolytus 4-spinosus._ Say).--Only once within\r\nmy memory has this minute but destructive beetle appeared in any\r\nconsiderable numbers in my neighborhood, although I have\r\noccasionally received a few specimens from correspondents in various\r\nparts of the country, even as far west as the Pacific coast in\r\nWashington. This borer is a very small, cylindrical, dark brown\r\nbeetle, about one-fifth of an inch or less in length, and\r\none-sixteenth in diameter. The hind part of the body is quite blunt\r\n(truncate), the males having four short but distinct blunt spines,\r\ntwo on each side, projecting from the hind part of the abdomen,\r\nhence the name \"4-spinosus.\" In the females these spines are absent,\r\notherwise they closely resemble the males. These bark borers usually\r\nappear here in the Northern States the last of June or early in\r\nJuly, and both sexes attack hickory trees of all species, but appear\r\nto prefer the old and nearly mature trees to the young and small\r\nwith thinner bark. After boring through the bark and reaching the\r\nsoft cambium layer underneath, upon which these insects feed, the\r\nfemale cuts a vertical channel in this substance, of little over an\r\ninch in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72. BURROWS OF HICKORY SCOLYTUS.]\r\n\r\nThis burrow is a little larger than the diameter of her body, and\r\nalong on both sides she deposits her eggs, to the number of ten to\r\nthirty, placing about an equal number on each side. When these eggs\r\nhatch, the young larvae begin to feed on the soft material by which\r\nthey are surrounded, making minute burrows at first, and at nearly\r\nright angles with the parent one; but as they increase in size they\r\nare forced to diverge, those above the center working upward, and\r\nthose below downward, as shown in Fig. 72. These burrows enlarge as\r\nthe grubs increase in size, as shown, most of them reaching their\r\nfull development by the time cold weather sets in, but some do not\r\ncease feeding until spring, then pass to the pupal stage, and later\r\nto the perfect or beetle form, and from the extreme end of these\r\nburrows they bore a hole straight out to the surface, and are then\r\nready to begin the cycle of life again, either on the tree from\r\nwhich they have emerged, or others near by. Some fifteen years ago I\r\nnoticed that the leaves of some of the old hickory trees on my place\r\nwere turning yellow prematurely, and upon examination I found the\r\nbark perforated with minute holes not larger than small bird shot,\r\nindicating the presence of the bark borer under consideration. Seven\r\nof the very largest and, presumably, the oldest, appeared to be\r\naffected, and these were immediately cut down and stripped of their\r\nbark, exposing the little grubs to the air and attacks of\r\ninsect-eating birds. These trees appeared to have been infested for\r\nseveral years, as there was scarcely a spot on the surface of the\r\nwood that had not been scarified with this pest. Since the\r\ndestruction of these trees I have not been troubled with bark\r\nborers, although there are still a number of very old and large\r\nhickories thriving in the same grove. The only remedy I can suggest\r\nis to cut down infested trees as soon as they are discovered, and\r\nalso encourage the insect-eating birds to remain in and near the nut\r\ngroves.\r\n\r\nThere are several other species of bark borers that occasionally\r\nattack hickories, one of these, the _Chramesus icoriae_, Leconte,\r\ninfests the small twigs, while another, the _Sinoxylon basilare_,\r\nsay, after boring through the bark, continues its course far into\r\nthe heartwood, showing a preference for this kind of food instead of\r\nthe living tissues. These pests, however, are rarely constant, but\r\nvery erratic, in their attacks, and while they may be rather\r\nabundant on a few or many trees a season or two, they then\r\ndisappear, and not one may be seen for several decades.\r\n\r\nTHE HICKORY-SHUCK WORM (_Grapholitha caryana._ Fitch).--The parent\r\nof this pest is a minute moth of the family _Tortricidae_, the small\r\ncaterpillars mining and boring the green husks, and sometimes into\r\nthe immature shell, causing the nuts to wither and drop off\r\nprematurely, although an occasional one may reach maturity, even in\r\nits scarified condition. This insect appears to be somewhat rare in\r\nthe East, but very abundant some years in the West, where it is\r\nfrequently destructive to the thick shellbark hickory and pecan. The\r\nfirst fresh specimens of the Nussbaumer Hybrid pecan nut (referred\r\nto on a preceding page) were so badly bored and scarified by this\r\nworm when received, that they would have been nearly or quite\r\nworthless for either planting or other purposes. As this insect\r\nattacks the nuts on the very largest trees in the forest and\r\nelsewhere, I cannot suggest any other remedy than to gather the\r\nimmature and infested nuts as they fall, and burn them, with their\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nAmong the larger Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) there are many\r\nspecies, the caterpillars of which occasionally feed on the leaves\r\nof the hickories, but not exclusively; consequently, they cannot be\r\nconsidered as the special enemies of this genus of trees. When they\r\ndo attack them, it is as much due to accident as design. This is\r\ncertainly true with the great Luna moth (_Attacus luna_) and the\r\nAmerican silk worm (_Telea polyphemus_), and various species of the\r\nCatocala, as well as the Tent caterpillar (_Clisiocampa sylvatica_).\r\n\r\nThere is also a hickory-nut weevil, closely allied to the species\r\ninfesting the chestnut; and while not quite as large, its habits are\r\nsimilar, and its ravages may be checked by the same or similar\r\nmeans. The grubs bore into the green nuts, causing some to fall\r\nbefore half-grown; others may remain in the nuts until they are ripe\r\nand gathered in the autumn; consequently, perforated hickory nuts\r\nare not at all rare, even on the stands of venders in our cities.\r\n\r\nBud worms, leaf miners, leaf rollers and plant lice,--and among the\r\nlatter several gall-making species,--are to be found on the\r\nhickories; but with all these natural enemies to contend with, the\r\nhickories thrive, grow, and yield their fruits in greater or less\r\nabundance. To enumerate, describe and illustrate all the insects\r\nknown to be enemies of the hickory would require a large volume, but\r\nfortunately there are many special works published on the insects\r\ninjurious to vegetation, and these are readily obtainable by all who\r\nmay have occasion to consult their pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE WALNUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuglans. The ancient Latin name, first used by Pliny, contracted\r\nfrom _Jovis glans_, the nut of Jove or Jupiter. A genus of about\r\neight species, three or four of these indigenous to the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n=Order=, _Juglandaceae_ (Walnut family).--Medium to large deciduous\r\ntrees with odd-pinnate leaves; leaflets from fifteen to twenty-one,\r\nserrate, mainly oblong and pointed. The sexes of flowers separate\r\n(monoecious) on the same tree, the males in pendulous green\r\ncylindrical catkins two to three inches long, solitary or in pairs,\r\nsessile,--not stalked, as in the hickories,--issuing from the\r\none-year-old twigs, and at the upper edge of the scar left by the\r\nfalling leaf of the previous season (Fig. 73), showing that the male\r\norgans emanate from an aggregation of bud-cells in the axils of the\r\nleaves during the preceding summer and autumn. Female flowers\r\nterminal on the new growth in spring, also single, in clusters, and\r\noccasionally in long pendulous racemes with a four-cleft calyx, four\r\nminute petals and two thick curved stigmas. Fruit round or oblong\r\n(Fig. 74); husk thin, drying up without opening by seams, as in the\r\nhickories. Shell of nut either rough and deeply corrugated, with\r\nsharp-pointed ridges, or quite smooth, with an undulating, wavy\r\nsurface, very thick in some species and thin in others; kernel two-\r\nor indistinctly four-lobed, united at the apex, fleshy, rich and\r\noily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73. PERSIAN WALNUT, SHOWING POSITION OF SEXUAL\r\nORGANS.]\r\n\r\n=History.=--The common walnut, so long and widely known in commerce\r\nunder various names, such as Persian, English, French, Italian and\r\nEuropean walnuts, also as Madeira nut, and recently Chile walnut,\r\nare now all believed to have descended from trees native of Persia,\r\nmost plentiful in the province of Ghilan on the Caspian sea, between\r\nlatitude 35 deg. and 40 deg., hence the old Grecian name of the fruit, viz.:\r\nPersicon and Basilicon, or Persian Royal nut, probably because\r\neither introduced by the Greek monarchs, or sent to them by the\r\nPersian kings. Later,--according to Pliny,--the Greeks called the\r\ntrees _Caryon_, on account of the strong scent of the foliage, and\r\nfrom this name Nuttall coined his word, _Carya_, for our indigenous\r\nhickories, as explained in the preceding chapter. It should also be\r\nnoted here that the elder Michaux, in 1782-4, was the first modern\r\nbotanist to visit the province of Ghilan, and he determined, by\r\npersonal investigation, that this species of the walnut was really\r\nindigenous to that region of country, along with the peach and\r\napricot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74. BEARING BRANCH OF ENGLISH WALNUT.]\r\n\r\nEarlier European authors claim that the walnut was first introduced\r\ninto Italy by Vitellius (emperor) early in the first century of the\r\nChristian Era,--but this is uncertain,--the Romans giving it the\r\nname of _Juglandes_, or the nut of Jove or Jupiter, both being the\r\nsame mythical personage. The nuts, at this early day, were highly\r\nprized, and also the wood of the tree, the latter being even more\r\nvaluable than that of the citron (orange and lemon). Ovid wrote a\r\npoem about these nuts, entitled _De Nuce_, from which we learn that\r\nboys were employed to, or did of their own accord, knock off these\r\nnuts; and that at marriages walnuts were thrown by the bride and\r\nbridegroom among the children, a ceremony which was supposed to\r\nindicate that the bridegroom had left off his boyish amusements, and\r\nthat the bride was no longer a votary of Diana, and it is quite\r\nprobable that the French word for nuptials, _des noces_, was derived\r\nfrom this ancient custom. The ancients also believed that walnuts\r\npossessed powerful medicinal properties, even to the curing of\r\nhydrophobia; but in these latter days they have lost most of their\r\ncurative virtues, in the opinion of the medical fraternity.\r\n\r\nAs with the chestnut, the planting of the walnut extended northward\r\ninto Gaul (France), hence the earlier name of Gaul nuts, which\r\nbecame corrupted into walnuts by the English-speaking people. The\r\nItalian name is _Noci_; in France, _Noyer_; and the Germans, with\r\ntheir usual habit of compounding names, call it _walnuss-baum_ or\r\nwalnut tree.\r\n\r\nJoannis De Loureiro, in his work on the plants of China, \"Flora\r\nCochinchinensis,\" published in 1790, claims that this Persian walnut\r\nis also a native of the northern provinces of China, with two other\r\nspecies which he describes (p. 573), adding, however, that one of\r\nthese is cultivated in Cochin China, and the other is found wild in\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\nThe wild form of this world-wide-famous nut is, doubtless, quite\r\ndifferent from the varieties with which we are familiar, for two\r\nthousand years or more of continuous cultivation and selections have\r\ngreatly changed the character of these nuts, as well as the habit of\r\nthe trees. The nuts from the wild trees are said to have a rather\r\nthick shell, and to be much smaller than the best of the improved\r\ncultivated varieties, or very like those we now obtain in China and\r\nJapan. The Persian walnut, in its many varieties, has been planted\r\nalmost everywhere in Europe as far north as Warsaw, but does not\r\nappear to have run wild and become naturalized, as with many other\r\nkinds of fruit and forest trees. In Great Britain it has probably\r\nbeen cultivated ever since the invasion of the country by the\r\nRomans, although a much later date is named by some of our modern\r\nhorticultural authorities. Dodoens (1552), Gerarde (1597), Parkinson\r\n(1629), and other of our early authors of works on cultivated\r\nplants, speak of the Persian walnut as common in various countries\r\nof Europe, Great Britain included. John Evelyn, in his \"Sylva\"\r\n(1664), says:\r\n\r\n    \"In Burgundy, walnut trees abound where they stand, in the\r\n    meadows of goodly lands, at sixty and a hundred feet distance,\r\n    and so far as hurting the crop, they are looked upon as great\r\n    preservers, keeping the ground warm, nor do the roots hinder the\r\n    plow.\"\r\n\r\nEvelyn, no doubt, had read what Pliny had said on this point, viz.:\r\n\r\n    \"Even the oak will not thrive near the walnut tree; which, if it\r\n    be true, may be owing to the interference of their roots in the\r\n    subsoil; but it is certain that neither grass nor field nor\r\n    garden crops thrive well under the walnut.\"\r\n\r\nEvelyn was far too good a gardener and close observer to fall into\r\nthe error of attributing noxious properties to the walnut tree,\r\nalthough Pliny's assertion, which has no foundation beyond his\r\nimagination, has been many times repeated in these days of supposed\r\ngeneral intelligence. Small plants may fail, under the shade of\r\nlarge trees, or when deprived of moisture by the roots of such\r\ntrees, but the walnut is no exception to the rule; in fact, such\r\ndeep-rooted kinds are less injurious than those with roots nearer\r\nthe surface. Evelyn, in continuing his account of the walnut in\r\nGermany, says:\r\n\r\n    \"Whenever they fell a tree, which is only the old, decayed, they\r\n    always plant a young one near him, and, in several places\r\n    betwixt Hanau and Frankfort, no young farmer whatsoever is\r\n    permitted to marry a wife till he bring proof that he is a\r\n    father of such a stated number of walnut trees; and the law is\r\n    inviolably observed to this day, for the extraordinary benefit\r\n    which this tree affords the inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a pity that some such custom could not have prevailed during\r\nthe past century in the United States. The author from whom I have\r\njust quoted adds that the Bergstrasse, which extends from Heidelberg\r\nto Darmstadt, is all planted with walnuts.\r\n\r\nCold winters, however, have occasionally played havoc with the\r\nwalnut trees in Europe, and one of these occurred in 1709, when the\r\ngreater part of the trees were seriously injured, especially in\r\nSwitzerland, Germany and France. Many trees were cut down for their\r\ntimber, which is always in great demand for gun-stocks and\r\nfurniture. Certain Dutch capitalists, foreseeing the scarcity of\r\nwalnut timber, bought up all they could procure, and years\r\nafterwards sold it at a greatly advanced price. In the year 1720 an\r\nact was passed in France to prevent the exportation of walnut\r\ntimber, and this led to the planting of these trees more extensively\r\nthan at any previous date; this practice has continued to the\r\npresent time, hence the immense revenue secured from the exportation\r\nof these nuts. The people of the United States are good customers\r\nfor the surplus stock of Europe, and will probably so continue,\r\nuntil we wake up to a sense of our folly of perpetually buying\r\narticles that could be readily produced at home, and at a very large\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n=Persian Walnut in America.=--The date of the first experiment in\r\nplanting this nut in this country is now probably unknown, but the\r\noldest tree that I have been able to find with anything like a\r\nsatisfactory history, is still growing vigorously at Washington\r\nHeights, on Manhattan Island, near 160th street and St. Nicholas\r\navenue. I gave a brief history of this noble monarch of its race in\r\nthe _American Garden_ for September, 1888, from which the following\r\naccount is condensed:\r\n\r\n    \"In 1758 Roger Morris, an English gentleman, built a spacious\r\n    mansion on his estate, at what, in later years, became known as\r\n    Washington Heights. His grounds were well laid out for that\r\n    time, and many rare foreign trees and shrubs planted, among them\r\n    several, as then called, English walnuts. Whether these trees\r\n    were raised from the nuts, or plants of some size imported, is\r\n    not now known. Mr. Morris may have procured the seedlings from\r\n    the Prince Nursery, Flushing, L. I., for this famous garden was\r\n    established in 1713, or forty-five years previous to the\r\n    building of the Morris mansion and the planting of the grounds\r\n    about it.\r\n\r\n    \"At that period no one doubted the hardiness of the so-called\r\n    English walnut in America, and as most of the nuts and trees\r\n    procured for planting came from acclimated stock in Great\r\n    Britain or the cooler region of Europe, success usually attended\r\n    such experiments. Our pioneers and horticulturists fully\r\n    expected that the trees would thrive and bear nuts in abundance,\r\n    and time has shown that they were not mistaken, although we\r\n    frequently see it stated at this late day, that the Persian\r\n    walnut is not hardy north of the latitude of Washington,\r\n    Philadelphia, or other cities south of New York.\r\n\r\n    \"One hundred and thirty-eight years have rolled by since walnut\r\n    trees were planted at Washington Heights, and at least one of\r\n    the originals has escaped destruction and holds its head aloft,\r\n    defying the tempests which frequently sweep over that elevated\r\n    and exposed spot on Manhattan Island. This veritable patriarch\r\n    of its race in America is a monster in size, its stem between\r\n    four and five feet in diameter at the base and more than\r\n    seventy-five feet high, with wide-spreading branches.\r\n\r\n    \"In the summer of 1776 the Battle of Long Island was fought, and\r\n    the American forces were compelled to retreat in confusion to\r\n    New York, thence northward up the island; but when they reached\r\n    Fort Washington, not far from the eleventh milestone on the old\r\n    Albany post road, they made a stand and proceeded to entrench\r\n    themselves at that place. This was in September, 1776, and\r\n    General Washington took possession of the Morris mansion near\r\n    by, making it his headquarters, and, as this was at the season\r\n    when the walnuts had reached an edible stage, we may safely\r\n    presume, from his well-known predilection for such delicacies,\r\n    that he tested the quality of the Morris walnuts. One hundred\r\n    and twenty years later I am writing this, with some fresh\r\n    specimens of nuts before me from that same old tree.\r\n\r\n    \"This old patriarch has cast its shade over many a noted person\r\n    in its time, for in 1810 the Morris estate passed into the hands\r\n    of Madame Jumel, a lady long famous for her hospitality and the\r\n    good cheer she extended to the surviving patriots of the\r\n    Revolution. From 1810 to the time of her death, 1865, Madame\r\n    Jumel's household always had an abundance of walnuts from the\r\n    old tree, and one of the workmen on the place informed me that\r\n    about two cartloads was considered a fair annual crop.\"\r\n\r\nIt cannot be many years before this old tree will meet the same fate\r\nthat has overtaken many of its younger contemporaries which were\r\nonce growing in the neighborhood, for with the rush for building\r\nlots and the opening of new streets and avenues, trees are usually\r\nin the way, and in such cases even patriarchs are not sacred, nor do\r\nthey command much respect from our urban population.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Since writing the above, and while these pages are\r\nbeing put in type, accidentally I learn with regret that the old\r\nMorris walnut tree has been destroyed.]\r\n\r\nA half-century ago there was quite a large number of walnut trees\r\nscattered about on the northern half of Manhattan Island, many of\r\nthese probably descendants of the old Morris trees, but of this\r\nnothing definite is now known. A number of persons whose ages\r\npermitted them to scan the early days of the present century, have\r\nassured me that in their childhood they had often collected walnuts\r\nfrom goodly sized trees on farms, from Harlem northward on the\r\nisland. The largest number of Persian walnut trees planted in any\r\none place was on the Tieman farm at Manhattanville, these being set\r\nout as roadside trees, some of which are still standing, although in\r\nthe march of improvements they must soon disappear. These trees have\r\nalways been noted for their productiveness, bearing a full crop\r\nevery alternate year, and a lighter one in what is termed the \"off\r\nseason.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the old Morris walnut tree, and the large number growing on\r\nthe Tieman estate, and scores of others scattered about New York\r\ncity and its suburbs, have been, and many still are, living\r\nwitnesses of the fact that varieties of the Persian walnut will\r\nthrive in this latitude, certain horticultural authors and essayists\r\nhave continually asserted the contrary.\r\n\r\nMr. F. J. Scott, in his superb and voluminous work, \"Suburban Home\r\nGrounds,\" in speaking of this species of the walnut, says, p. 351:\r\n\r\n    \"Though greatly valued in England and on the continent for its\r\n    beauty, as well as for its nuts, its want of hardiness in the\r\n    Northern States, and lack of any peculiar beauty in the South,\r\n    has prevented its culture to any great extent in this country.\r\n    South of Philadelphia it may be grown with safety.\"\r\n\r\nThis seems strange language to have come from such an eminent\r\nauthority as the late Mr. Scott, inasmuch as he must have passed a\r\nhundred times within sight, if not in the very shadow of the rows of\r\nold walnut trees growing at Manhattanville, when going from New York\r\ncity to Newburgh, where he studied landscape gardening under the\r\nlamented A. J. Downing, and to whom the work from which I have\r\nquoted is dedicated. It is quite evident, however, that our author,\r\nlike many others, failed to see things that should have interested\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAs an offset to Mr. Scott's idea of the northern limit for the\r\nsuccessful cultivation of this nut, I may refer to the work of Mr.\r\nGeorge Jacques, \"Practical Treatise on Fruit Trees, Adapted to the\r\nInterior of New England,\" published at Worcester, Mass., 1849. In\r\nreferring to the European walnut, p. 238, he says:\r\n\r\n    \"It is perfectly hardy on Long Island, and to the south of New\r\n    York, and as far north as the city of Charlestown in this State\r\n    (Mass.), where there may be seen, in the enclosure of a\r\n    residence on Harvard street, two fine trees of this kind, either\r\n    of them much taller and larger than our large-sized apple trees.\r\n    We have eaten nuts from these trees well ripened and fully equal\r\n    to any of those imported. The trees often bear a crop of some\r\n    bushels.\"\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to search for further proof to show that certain\r\nexcellent varieties of the Persian walnut do thrive and bear\r\nabundantly in our Northern States; not, perhaps, in the extreme\r\nboreal borders of New England, nor in those of the northwest, but\r\nthe acclimated sorts are pretty safe as far north as 42 deg. of\r\nlatitude, and in protected locations may crowd up a half degree\r\nmore. I have found very productive trees of this nut in northern New\r\nJersey, several in Bergen county, others in Passaic, and thence\r\nsouthward, and while they are few in number, they are sufficient to\r\nprove that this tree is adapted to the soil and climate of the\r\nentire State. We seldom find more than one or two trees in any\r\ngarden, and these are probably more the result of accident than\r\ndesign, their owners seeming to be satisfied in possessing something\r\nin the way of a tree not common in the neighborhood, never thinking\r\nthat it might be well to plant enough of such trees to have them\r\nbecome a source of revenue. The parentage of quite a number of these\r\nbearing trees is readily traced to the Morris and Tieman stock,\r\nshowing that these old trees are of a hardy and prolific race, which\r\nare well worthy of perpetuation for cold climates. Very old and\r\nlarge walnut trees are reported as growing in Pennsylvania and other\r\nof the Middle States, but they are far from being numerous. It has\r\nlong been claimed that this species of nut succeeded best in the\r\nSouthern States, and it is probably true, especially with the tender\r\nvarieties; but for some reason, unknown to me, they have not been\r\nplanted there in sufficient numbers to have, as yet, become of any\r\ncommercial importance.\r\n\r\nDuring the past twenty-five years these nuts have been more\r\nextensively planted in California than elsewhere in the United\r\nStates, and we may expect soon to know something definite in regard\r\nto results. Nearly all of the favorite French varieties have been\r\nintroduced, and are now being tested in different parts of the\r\nState, and it is quite likely that the greater part will succeed,\r\nalthough some of the early-blooming sorts may fail in localities\r\nsubject to late spring frosts. Previous to the introduction of\r\ngrafted trees of the named varieties, the only trees of this kind\r\nplanted in California were seedlings raised from the common imported\r\nnuts; but I have no statistics at hand to determine the date of the\r\nfirst plantings of this kind.\r\n\r\nOf late years there has been received, at some of our seaports, and\r\nespecially at New York, some quite large consignments of walnuts\r\nfrom South America, under the name of \"Chile walnuts,\" but they are\r\nonly varieties of the Persian raised in Chile. They are generally of\r\ngood size, moderately thin shelled, with plump kernels of excellent\r\nflavor. They are in great demand for confectionery, and are really\r\nbetter for such purposes than the larger and fancy bleached walnuts\r\nimported under the somewhat general name of Grenobles, or French\r\nwalnuts. Owing to the difference of climate, these Chile walnuts\r\narrive here late in winter, or about the time those coming from\r\nEuropean countries the previous autumn begin to become somewhat\r\nstale.\r\n\r\nOf our native species of this genus (_Juglans_), the almost\r\neverywhere common butternut ranks first in flavor and general\r\nestimation, but owing to its hard, rough shell, and the difficulty\r\nin extracting the kernel, it has never become of any considerable\r\nimportance, although usually found in our markets in limited\r\nquantities. Of course, it is a general favorite in the country, and\r\nwherever found in sufficient quantities the boys and girls lay up a\r\ngoodly supply for winter use; and cracking butternuts during the\r\nlong winter evenings is a pastime and pleasure not to be ignored nor\r\nforgotten. The flavor of the butternut is far more delicate, and\r\nbetter, than any of the Persian species, but the difficulty in\r\nextracting the rather small kernel is a serious objection.\r\n\r\nThe black walnut has a larger kernel, in proportion to its size,\r\nthan the butternut, and it is not so difficult to extract when the\r\nnuts are dry, but the flavor is too rank for most palates, although\r\nit has often been referred to as excellent by the earlier botanists\r\nwho visited this country; but it has never been considered of much\r\nvalue until quite recently, or since the manufacturers of\r\nconfectionery discovered that heat somewhat subdued the rank flavor,\r\nand now many tons of the meats are annually consumed in candies and\r\nwalnut cakes. I am credibly informed that cracking black walnuts and\r\nshipping the meats to our larger cities has become quite an\r\nextensive industry in several of the Middle and Western States. We\r\nhave two other but smaller native species of the walnut that will be\r\ndescribed further on, under the head Species and Varieties.\r\n\r\n=Propagation of Walnuts.=--The propagation of the walnut in the\r\nnatural way, or by seed, is exceedingly simple, for the nuts grow\r\nreadily and freely if planted soon after they are ripe, or any time\r\nbefore they become old and the kernels shriveled. It is, of course,\r\nbest to plant them while fresh, but they are not at all delicate,\r\nand may be transported a long distance in a dry condition without\r\nseriously affecting their vitality. If walnuts are given the same\r\ncare as recommended in the preceding pages for other kinds of nuts,\r\nso much the better.\r\n\r\nThe seedlings of walnuts, like those of other species, usually\r\nproduce long taproots, and if grown in a compact soil, these will\r\nhave few small lateral fibers the first season, as shown in Fig. 75;\r\nbut when taken up and the vertical main root shortened at _a_, and\r\nthen replanted, they produce fibrous roots in abundance. The trees\r\nof almost any age from one to twenty years old, are not at all\r\ndifficult to make live when transplanted, provided the branches or\r\ntops of the trees are reduced, to correspond with loss of roots in\r\ndigging up at the time of removal. It may be well to give a word of\r\ncaution to the novice in nut culture about pruning nut trees in\r\nspring, after the sap begins to flow; for if done at this time they\r\nwill bleed freely and leave unhealthy wounds and black, unsightly\r\nspots on the bark. Prune walnuts in summer or early in winter, to\r\ngive time for the wounds to season before the buds swell in spring.\r\nIf young trees are to be dug up, prune after they are taken from the\r\nground, then the sap will not flow from the wounds. This is true of\r\nall deciduous trees, vines and shrubs. If the trees have few small\r\nroots when taken up, prune severely; but if roots are abundant,\r\nlittle pruning will be required. It is seldom, however, in\r\ntransplanting walnuts, that the pruning need be as severe as\r\nrecommended for the chestnut; in fact, having transplanted walnuts\r\nof various species, and of all ages from one to twenty years,\r\nwithout the loss of a plant, I have come to the conclusion that they\r\nare pretty safe trees to handle, in this climate, at least, if not\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75. SEEDLING WALNUT.]\r\n\r\nIn seeking walnuts from a distance, for planting anywhere in the\r\nMiddle or Northern States, it will be well to learn something in\r\nadvance about the climate in which the nuts are raised; for it would\r\nbe folly to send for either trees or nuts to a warm or semi-tropical\r\nregion, like that of southern France or Spain, for a stock to\r\ncultivate in a climate as cold as that of New York, New Jersey, and\r\nStates on the same line westward. We might, perchance, from such\r\nimportation, secure one hardy plant in a hundred or thousand, but\r\nthere would be no certainty of even this small number.\r\n\r\nThis idea of acclimation and adaptation of trees to conditions and\r\nclimate should not be overlooked by the nut culturist, no matter\r\nfrom what source he procures his stock, whether from abroad, or some\r\ndistant region of his own country. If it can be obtained from a\r\nregion where it has been growing under conditions similar to those\r\nto which it is to be transferred for cultivation, then the chances\r\nof success will certainly be largely augmented. Acclimation is a\r\nslow process; in fact, too slow for us to expect to secure any\r\nappreciable advantages from it in a lifetime, but in nature we seek\r\nfinal results, leaving time out of the question.\r\n\r\nIn raising seedling trees we cannot expect much more than a\r\nreproduction of the species, and not that of the parent tree. Plants\r\nthat have been subjected to unnatural conditions and surroundings,\r\nas usual under cultivation, are far more likely to show a wider\r\nrange of variation in the seedlings than those growing wild in their\r\nnative habitats; but even the latter cannot be depended upon to\r\nreproduce exact types from seed. In other words, there is nothing\r\ncertain about seedling nut trees; the large nuts may produce trees\r\nbearing very small ones, the early-ripening give late ones, the tall\r\ndwarf trees and the precocious fruiting some of the most tardy\r\nvarieties; and yet, with all this uncertainty, we still think it\r\nbest to select for planting the best nuts obtainable, _i. e._, best\r\nand most promising for the conditions under which the seedlings are\r\nto be grown.\r\n\r\nFor the multiplication and perpetuation of choice varieties we must\r\nresort to artificial modes of propagation, mainly by budding and\r\ngrafting. These modes, however, while the best at present known, are\r\nso difficult and uncertain in cool climates,--even in the hands of\r\nthe most skilful propagators,--that grafted walnut trees have never\r\nbeen very plentiful in the nurseries of this or other countries with\r\nwhich we have commercial relations. In the south of France\r\nnurserymen appear to have been more successful in the propagation of\r\nwalnuts by budding and grafting, than elsewhere; but in the northern\r\nprovinces, as well as in Great Britain, we hear little of this mode\r\nof propagation. So difficult has this mode of propagating the walnut\r\nbeen considered in England, that Thomas Andrew Knight, president of\r\nthe London Horticultural Society, early in the present century\r\ndiscouraged all attempts to propagate this tree by such means; but\r\nlater, in a paper read before the Society April 7, 1818, he admits\r\nto having changed his mind, especially in regard to budding the\r\nwalnut, and says:\r\n\r\n    \"The buds of trees of almost every species succeed with most\r\n    certainty when inserted on the shoots of the same year's growth;\r\n    but the walnut tree appears to afford an exception; possibly, in\r\n    some measure, because its buds contain within themselves, in the\r\n    spring, all the leaves which the tree bears in the following\r\n    summer, whence its annual shoots cease to elongate soon after\r\n    its buds unfold; all its buds of each season are also,\r\n    consequently, very nearly of the same age, and long before any\r\n    have acquired the proper degree of maturity for being removed,\r\n    the annual branches have ceased to grow longer or to produce new\r\n    foliage.... To obviate the disadvantage arising from the\r\n    preceding circumstances, I adopted means of retarding the period\r\n    of the vegetation of the stocks comparatively with that of the\r\n    bearing tree: and by these means I became partially successful.\r\n    There are, at the base of the annual shoots of the walnut and\r\n    other trees, where these join the year-old wood, many minute\r\n    buds which are almost concealed in the bark, and which rarely or\r\n    never vegetate but in the event of the destruction of the large\r\n    prominent buds which occupy the middle and opposite end of the\r\n    annual wood. By inserting in each stock one of these minute buds\r\n    and one of the large prominent kind, I had the pleasure to find\r\n    that the minute buds took freely, while the large all failed\r\n    without a single exception.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the above and other remarks of Mr. Knight, in the paper read by\r\nhim, I infer that he kept the stocks in pots stored in a cool place\r\nin spring, until he could obtain shoots of the season from bearing\r\ntrees, and from these minute undeveloped axillary buds for inserting\r\nin the stocks. These buds, as he informs us, are inserted in the\r\nwood of the preceding season, and near the summit or top. He does\r\nnot give any directions for holding the buds in place, whether by\r\nwaxed or plain bass ligatures; the former, however, would probably\r\nbe preferable, for the purpose of excluding the air and water.\r\n\r\nSome twenty years later (1838) J. C. Loudon, in \"Arboretum\r\nBritannicum,\" etc., refers to the propagation of the walnut as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    \"Much has been written on the subject by French authors, from\r\n    which it appears that in the north of France, and in cold\r\n    countries generally, the walnut does not bud or graft easily by\r\n    any mode; but that in the south of France and north of Italy it\r\n    may be budded or grafted by different modes, with success. At\r\n    Metz, the Baron de Tschoudy found the flute method (Fig. 76)\r\n    almost the only one which he could practice with success. By\r\n    this mode an entire ring of bark, containing one or more buds,\r\n    is removed from a twig on a tree to be multiplied, and\r\n    transferred to the stock, and made to fit as shown. If the ring\r\n    is too large, a slice may be cut off; and if too small, a piece\r\n    of the bark of the stock may be left to fill the space.\"\r\n\r\nBoth stock and parent tree must be in about the same condition or\r\nstage of growth when this ring budding is done, in order that the\r\nbark containing the bud may peel off freely from the wood, and this\r\nis always in the spring, soon after the buds begin to unfold and the\r\nsap is in motion. Loudon says that in Dauphine, France, young plants\r\nin the nurseries are budded chiefly by this mode, which succeeds\r\nbest the closer the operation is performed to the collar of the\r\nplant; and the same is true in grafting, the nearer the root the\r\nbetter, as has been found by experience with hickories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76. FLUTE BUDDING.]\r\n\r\nCharles Baltet, in his \"L'Art de Greffer,\" recommends grafting in\r\nthe usual mode of crown grafting, also flute or ring grafting, in\r\nApril or May, and ordinary cleft grafting close to the root and at\r\nthe forks of the branches, etc. He says that the cion should be cut,\r\nas much as possible, obliquely across the pith, so that it may be\r\nexposed on one side only. He also advises using cions whose base\r\nconsists of wood of two years' growth, and these furnished with a\r\nterminal bud. He cautions propagators against grafting early-growing\r\nkinds upon those of later vegetation. If walnuts of any of the\r\nnative or foreign species have been successfully propagated by\r\nbudding or grafting, at any of the nurseries in our Eastern States,\r\nit has not been made known in the nurserymen's catalogues.\r\n\r\nMichael Floy, who early in the present century had quite extensive\r\ngrounds devoted to fruit and ornamental trees, near what is now the\r\ncenter of New York city, as we learn from his \"Guide to the\r\nOrchard,\" published in 1833, claims, in this work, that the Persian\r\nwalnuts thrive well in this country, but admits that he had never\r\nsucceeded in grafting the trees, and with the hickories had no\r\nbetter success, although he had tried them many times; but he adds:\r\n\r\n    \"Still I do not say it is impossible either to bud or graft\r\n    them; but there is something peculiar about it, for both the bud\r\n    and graft turn black when cut, almost instantaneously. Others\r\n    may succeed better, but let them try it before they affirm it\r\n    upon hearsay; they may succeed very well by inarching.\"\r\n\r\nComing down to the present day, in our search for facts and\r\ninformation in regard to the propagation of varieties of the walnut,\r\nwe may find it interesting to visit California, which, of all the\r\nStates of the Union, is perhaps the best adapted to nut culture in\r\ngeneral; besides, a larger number of nut trees of various kinds have\r\nbeen planted there than elsewhere in this country. It is in\r\nCalifornia that we find such men as Felix Gillet, of Nevada City, an\r\nenthusiastic propagator and cultivator of fruit and nut trees, and\r\nespecially of the latter, if we may judge by his works and writings\r\non this branch of horticulture,--and so far as I have been able to\r\nlearn, he is the only nurseryman in the United States who has\r\ngrafted walnut trees of many different varieties for sale.\r\n\r\nIn regard to modes of propagation, Mr. Gillet says that the common\r\nmode of shield budding, as employed on fruit trees, fails entirely\r\nwith small walnuts from one to three years from the seed, and it\r\ndoes but seldom succeed even on larger stocks. When tried on large,\r\nold stocks, he advises removing all the wood from the inner side of\r\nthe strip of bark on which the bud is situated, and at the same time\r\nhave this strip not less than two inches long and as broad as\r\npossible. He describes his mode of grafting walnuts, which does not\r\ndiffer materially from those already given. That he has never\r\nattained any very remarkable results may be inferred from the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n        \"We will add that the 'grafted walnuts' that we offer were\r\n    grafted expressly for us, regardless of cost, by the most\r\n    reliable firm to be found in the walnut district in France,\r\n    through a process discovered several years ago, and which we\r\n    will briefly describe for the benefit of people who may be\r\n    inclined to try this new method of grafting very young walnuts.\r\n\r\n    \"One-year-old seedlings of the size of the little finger, or\r\n    about one-half inch in diameter at the butt, are selected, the\r\n    root cut back short enough to permit the planting of the trees\r\n    in pots of three inches in depth; the trees, previously to being\r\n    potted, are grafted with cions exactly of the same size, whip or\r\n    cleft grafting being used; the pots are then taken to a hot or\r\n    propagating house, and a glass bell set over them to prevent the\r\n    outside air getting to the grafts, the temperature of the house\r\n    being kept day and night, at least for fifteen days, or till the\r\n    grafting has taken, to 70 deg. F. When the grafts are well taken and\r\n    growing, the glass bells are removed, and the grafts allowed to\r\n    grow three or four inches, before the little grafted trees are\r\n    set out in nursery rows; it may be preferable, especially in\r\n    certain parts of the country, to keep the trees in the pots till\r\n    the ensuing spring. Forty to fifty per cent of the grafts will\r\n    succeed, and it is the best that can be done.\r\n\r\n    \"This mode of grafting the walnut, besides requiring a hothouse,\r\n    needs the care of a skillful person to make it succeed. So are\r\n    grafted the little trees that we import from France, and that we\r\n    plant in nursery rows and offer to the public.\"\r\n\r\nFor other modes of root grafting, I refer the reader to those\r\nrecommended for the hickories, in the preceding chapter. Propagating\r\nwalnuts by layers is practicable, where the small trees have been\r\ncut down to force out new shoots near the surface of the ground,\r\nthen bent down and covered with soil in the usual method of layering\r\nwoody plants.\r\n\r\n=Planting and Pruning.=--The plants will produce a greater number of\r\nfibrous roots if the nuts are planted in light, loose, but rich\r\nsoil, than in a heavy, tenacious one; but with all kinds it is best\r\nto transplant when one or two years old, and cut off a portion of\r\nthe taproots, as recommended for the hickories. When removed from\r\nthe nursery rows for final planting, prune away nearly or quite all\r\nside branches, leaving only the terminal bud if the trees are not\r\nmore than six to eight feet high. After final planting where the\r\ntrees are to remain permanently, very little pruning will ever be\r\nrequired, further than to cut away branches that may cross each\r\nother, or to shorten some to give proper form to the head. No tree\r\nin cultivation requires less pruning than walnuts.\r\n\r\nAs a genus of trees the walnuts flourish best in deep, rich loam,\r\nrather light than heavy, and in this country require considerable\r\nmoisture at the roots, and some, like the butternut, succeed best in\r\nbottomlands, near creeks and larger streams. If the soil is\r\nnaturally too dry for such trees, the fault can be readily remedied\r\nby the use of some form of mulch applied to the surface of the soil\r\naround the stem after planting, renewing this annually, or oftener\r\nif necessary, until the trees are large enough to shade the ground.\r\n\r\nWalnut trees, as well as the closely allied hickories, are well\r\nadapted for roadside planting, and when set in such positions are\r\nfar less likely to be injured by insects than when planted in\r\norchards or large groups, besides serving a double purpose, being\r\nornamental as well as useful. They may also be planted around\r\nbuildings, and where other and less valuable trees are generally\r\ngrown. There are also millions of acres of rocky hill-sides and old\r\nfields which might be utilized for nut orchards, and if rather\r\nwidely scattered over such land they would prove beneficial in\r\nshading the pasture grasses. First of all, however, let us have rows\r\nof these trees along all our country roads, after which it will be\r\ntime enough to begin planting them elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIES AND VARIETIES OF WALNUTS.\r\n\r\n=Native of the United States= (_Juglans cinerea._ Linn.). Butternut.\r\nWhite Walnut.--Leaflets fifteen to nineteen, oblong-lanceolate and\r\nsharp-pointed, rounded at the base, downy, especially on the\r\nunderside, petioles covered with viscid hairs; fruit oblong, two or\r\nmore inches in length, with a clammy husk, not opening when ripe,\r\nbut closely adhering to the deeply corrugated and rough, thick\r\nshell. Trees with wide-spreading branches, and of medium hight, or\r\nfrom forty to fifty feet, but in deep forests sometimes sixty to\r\nseventy, with stems two to three feet in diameter. A common tree in\r\nmoist soils almost everywhere, from the Canadas southward to the\r\nhighlands of northern Georgia, Alabama, and sparingly in Mississippi\r\nand Arkansas, and all the States bordering the Mississippi river\r\nnorthward to Minnesota. A valuable timber tree, with soft, light\r\nwood, much used of late for furniture and inside house finishing. In\r\nearly times the inner bark was employed for making a yellow dye,\r\nalso as a medicine, the extract being a mild cathartic, hence one of\r\nthe specific names, _Cathartica_.\r\n\r\nSynonyms.\r\n\r\n  _Juglans oblonga alba_, Marshall.\r\n  _Juglans cathartica_, Michaux.\r\n  _Carya cathartica_, Barton, 1818.\r\n  _Wallia cinerea_, Alefeld, 1861.\r\n\r\n=Varieties of the Butternut.=--There are to be found many varieties\r\nof the butternut, varying mainly in the size of the nuts, and only\r\nslightly in the thickness of the shell; but I am not aware that any\r\nof these have ever been propagated, all the trees in cultivation or\r\nelsewhere having been grown from the nuts. This nut is, no doubt,\r\nsusceptible of great improvement, as well as others of the genus,\r\nand it is worthy of being experimented with for that purpose,\r\nespecially in cold, northern climates, where there are few or no\r\nother kinds of edible nuts. Probably the most direct and surest way\r\nto secure improved varieties is by hybridizing, taking the butternut\r\nfor the female parent, and the Persian walnut for the male. Hybrids\r\nbetween these two species are already known, and they will, no\r\ndoubt, become more plentiful as soon as skillful horticulturists are\r\nencouraged to produce them. Several hybrid walnuts of other species\r\nare figured and described by European horticulturists, but, so far\r\nas known, they are mainly accidental productions, and not the result\r\nof any direct effort of man; nature, in this instance, merely giving\r\na hint of the possible, leaving us to avail ourselves of the lesson\r\nif we feel so inclined.\r\n\r\nJ. Le Conte, in a list of four hundred and fifty plants, collected\r\nby him on the island of New York (Manhattan), and published in the\r\n\"Medical and Philosophical Register,\" Vol. II, 1812, mentions a\r\nhybrid walnut among the number. Dr. John Torrey, in \"Catalogue of\r\nPlants,\" etc., 1819, refers to this tree under the name of _Juglans\r\nhybrida_, and says that it is growing near where Eighth avenue\r\nintersects the road called Lake Tours, about three miles from the\r\ncity, and is a large tree. This specimen probably disappeared long\r\nago, and we have no means now of determining its origin or between\r\nwhat two species it was a hybrid.\r\n\r\nRecently Prof. C. S. Sargent has discovered other hybrid walnuts in\r\nthe neighborhood of Boston, and figured and described one in _Garden\r\nand Forest_ for Oct. 31, 1894. He says:\r\n\r\n    \"My attention was first called to the fact by observing that a\r\n    tree which I had supposed was a so-called English walnut\r\n    (_Juglans regia_), in the grounds connected with the Episcopal\r\n    school of Harvard college, at Cambridge, was not injured by the\r\n    cold of the severest winters, although _Juglans regia_ generally\r\n    suffers from cold here, and rarely grows to a large size. This\r\n    individual is really a noble tree; the trunk forks, about five\r\n    feet above the surface of the ground, into two limbs, and\r\n    girths, at the point where its diameter is smallest, fifteen\r\n    feet and two inches. The divisions of the trunk spread slightly\r\n    and form a wide, round-topped head of pendulous branches of\r\n    unusual symmetry and beauty, and probably sixty to seventy feet\r\n    high. A closer examination of this tree showed that it was\r\n    hardly to be distinguished from _Juglans regia_ in habit, in the\r\n    character of the bark, or in the form and coloring of the\r\n    leaves, and that the oblong nut, with its thick shell deeply\r\n    sculptured into narrow ridges, was the slightly modified nut of\r\n    our native butternut, _Juglans regia_. Two other trees with the\r\n    same peculiarities were afterwards found. One is a large,\r\n    wide-spreading specimen, with a trunk diameter of four feet\r\n    three inches about two feet above the surface of the ground, and\r\n    just below the point where it divides into three large limbs.\r\n    This is on the grounds of Mr. Eben Bacon of Jamaica Plain, and\r\n    is supposed to have been planted between fifty and sixty years\r\n    ago. The other has a tall, straight trunk, with a diameter of\r\n    three feet one inch at three feet above the surface of the\r\n    ground, and is growing on a farm near Houghton's Pond, in\r\n    Milton, at the base of the southeastern slope of the Blue\r\n    Hills.\"\r\n\r\nThat there should be hybrid walnuts is nothing strange or wonderful,\r\nand we often marvel that there should be so few of them in regions\r\nwhere two or more species are growing in close proximity in the same\r\nforest, or elsewhere, but from whence came these specimens in\r\nMassachusetts is somewhat of a mystery. We may safely conclude,\r\nhowever, that the hybridizing did not occur there, but somewhere\r\nelse, and either the nuts or small seedling trees were introduced\r\nand planted where these hybrid specimens are now growing. It is\r\npossible that they are descendants of the old hybrid walnut tree of\r\nNew York city, mentioned by Le Conte and Dr. Torrey, some one having\r\nsent nuts or seedlings to friends in Massachusetts, and the three\r\ntrees described by Prof. Sargent are merely those which have\r\nsurvived until the present day, these retaining the hybrid\r\ncharacteristics of their parent. These hybrids may or may not\r\npossess any special economic value, but they are of considerable\r\nscientific interest, and for this reason alone are well worthy of\r\ncareful preservation and extensive propagation.\r\n\r\n_Butternut Sugar._--It has often been claimed that sugar can be made\r\nfrom the native butternut tree, and while it is true that the\r\nsweetish sap flows readily from wounds made in this tree in early\r\nspring, the amount and quality of sugar to be obtained from it is\r\nscarcely worthy of serious attention. In my boyhood days butternut\r\nsyrup and sugar were considered as \"sticky jokes\" of the sugar camp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77. FLOWERING BRANCH OF HYBRID WALNUT.\r\n\r\n_J. regia_ x _J. Californica_.]\r\n\r\n=Hybrids in California.=--Mrs. Ninetta Eames, writing, in the\r\n_American Agriculturist_, of new varieties of walnuts in California,\r\nrefers to certain species and varieties growing in that State, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"On one of the avenues in Santa Rosa there are some dozen or so\r\n    ornamental shade trees, which invariably attract the passers. It\r\n    is not only that they are uncommonly beautiful, but that there\r\n    is something unfamiliar about them. One unhesitatingly\r\n    pronounces them 'walnuts,' from their unmistakable likeness to\r\n    both the English walnut and the native species found growing\r\n    along the streams of middle and southern California. They are,\r\n    in fact, a cross between the _Juglans regia_ and _J.\r\n    Californica_, the wild black walnut of this State. In its\r\n    appearance, this magnificent hybrid is nicely balanced between\r\n    both parents, but it is superior to either of them in beauty and\r\n    luxuriance of foliage, and in its phenomenal growth. There is,\r\n    indeed, but one tree, the eucalyptus, that grows more rapidly.\r\n    In speaking of this quality in the new walnut, Mr. Luther\r\n    Burbank says: 'It often excels the combined growth of both\r\n    parents, adding twelve to sixteen feet to its hight in one year.\r\n    Given like conditions, a budded six-year-old hybrid is twice as\r\n    large as a black walnut at twenty years of age.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78. HYBRID WALNUT. _J. nigra_ x _J.\r\nCalifornica_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79. HYBRID WALNUT, SHELL REMOVED. _J. nigra_ x\r\n_J. Californica_.]\r\n\r\n    \"The clean cut, bright green leaves make a remarkable showing,\r\n    being all the way from two feet to a yard in length, and of\r\n    graceful, drooping habit (Fig. 77). They are sweet-scented,\r\n    too,--a delightful fragrance, resembling that of June apples.\r\n    Another admirable feature of this hybrid walnut is its smooth,\r\n    grayish bark, with white marblings not unlike the Eastern sugar\r\n    maple. The wood is compact, with lustrous, satiny grain, and\r\n    takes an elegant polish, which gives it unmistakable commercial\r\n    value. Like the majority of hybrids, though blossoming freely it\r\n    yields a scant crop of nuts, one or two annually on a single\r\n    tree, and this only after twelve years of persistent barrenness.\r\n    The seed, when planted, goes back to its parent\r\n    distinctiveness,--one-half turning out to be English walnuts and\r\n    the other half black walnuts,--the true hybrid being only\r\n    reproduced by grafting on a thrifty young _Juglans Californica_.\r\n\r\n    \"Another handsome novelty in shade trees, is a hybrid from the\r\n    _Juglans nigra_, or well-known Eastern black walnut, and _J.\r\n    Californica_ (Figs. 78 and 79). It makes a charming ornamental\r\n    tree, and bears, in its season, a prolific crop of unusually\r\n    large nuts, which have little value except in the eyes of school\r\n    children. Several of these hybrids are growing in Santa Rosa,\r\n    and present an interesting study to the pomologist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80. JUGLANS SIEBOLDIANA RACEME.]\r\n\r\n    \"A still more unique species of the walnut genus is the _Juglans\r\n    Sieboldiana_, a Japanese walnut which grows abundantly in the\r\n    mountainous districts of the island of Yesso, and also in the\r\n    more southern divisions of the empire. Several of these\r\n    remarkable trees are to be found in the Kew gardens, but only\r\n    one specimen is said to be growing in America, and this has\r\n    recently come into profuse bearing on the Burbank experimental\r\n    farm, eight miles from Santa Rosa, California. According to good\r\n    authority, this Japanese walnut not only attains its greatest\r\n    perfection in this favored climate, but it thrives equally well\r\n    in countries too cold for the common walnut, _J. regia_. In its\r\n    wild state in Japan, the _Juglans Sieboldiana_ (whose curious\r\n    raceme of nuts is shown in Fig. 80) makes a wide-spreading tree\r\n    about fifty feet in hight, with pale, furrowed bark; nuts an\r\n    inch and a half long, with a diameter one-third less, and a\r\n    kernel having much the flavor of the common walnut. The tree\r\n    bearing so thriftily on California soil, suggests its possible\r\n    value as a marketable nut, while it already furnishes a\r\n    remarkable addition to horticultural interests.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81. BLACK WALNUT IN HUSK.]\r\n\r\nJUGLANS NIGRA, Linn. Black Walnut.--Leaflets eleven to seventeen,\r\nrarely more; ovate-lanceolate, smooth above, moderately pubescent\r\nbeneath, pointed, somewhat heart-shaped at the base; leaf-stalks\r\nslightly downy, usually of a pale purplish color early in the\r\nseason, especially on young trees; fruit large, mostly globose (Fig.\r\n81); husk thin, roughly dotted; shell thick, hard, deeply and\r\nunevenly corrugated with rough, sharp ridges and points (Fig. 82);\r\nkernel large, sweet, but usually with a strong, rather rank taste,\r\nbut less oily than the butternut. Trees grow to an immense size,\r\nwith deeply furrowed bark; wood dark colored, valuable for cabinet\r\nwork, inside finishing, gun stocks, etc. Common in deep, rich soils,\r\nfrom western Massachusetts west to southern Minnesota, and southward\r\nto Florida. Most abundant west of the Alleghany mountains, and\r\nespecially in the rich valleys of the Western States distant from\r\nrailroads and water communication; elsewhere the trees have long\r\nsince been cut for their timber. I have only one synonym to record,\r\nand this is scarcely worthy of notice, viz.: _Wallia nigra_.\r\n(Alefeld in \"Bonplandia,\" 1861.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82. JUGLANS NIGRA, HUSK REMOVED.]\r\n\r\n=Varieties of the Black Walnut.=--As with the butternut, there are\r\nno varieties of the black walnut in cultivation; at least, none\r\npropagated by means which will insure the perpetuation of their\r\nvarietal characteristics. It is true that there are plenty of wild\r\nvarieties to be found, these varying widely in size and form, and\r\nsomewhat in thickness of their shell, as well as the ease with which\r\nthe kernels may be extracted, but none of these have been\r\nperpetuated by artificial means. Among the earliest varieties\r\nrecognized by botanists, one was called Oblong Black Walnut,\r\n_Juglans nigra oblonga_, by Miller, 1754, and perhaps in earlier\r\neditions of the \"Gardener's Dictionary.\" He says this is from\r\nVirginia, and only a variety of the common black walnut. Marshall,\r\nin 1785, describes this \"black oblong fruited walnut,\" and adds:\r\n\"There are, perhaps, some other varieties.\" These oblong, or, more\r\ncorrectly speaking, oval nuts, often sharp-pointed at both ends, are\r\nrather plentiful at this time. There are rarely any considerable\r\nnumber of bushels reaching market from Virginia and adjacent States,\r\namong which these oval or oblong nuts cannot be found. I have a\r\nnumber before me measuring from one inch to one and a quarter in\r\ndiameter, and from one and a half to nearly two inches in length.\r\nOther varieties found, perhaps, in the same lot, are broader than\r\nlong, or one and seven-eighths inches broad, by one and one-half in\r\nvertical diameter. These measurements are of the cleaned shell,\r\nafter the husks have been removed.\r\n\r\nFor several years a \"thin-shelled black walnut\" has been offered by\r\nat least two nurserymen, in whose catalogues they are described as\r\n\"with unusually thin shells, the kernels coming out whole.\" I have\r\nendeavored to ascertain the origin of this variety, but failed, for\r\nboth of the nursery firms who advertised the frees for sale admit\r\nthat they do not know from whom they obtained the nuts planted, or\r\nwhere the original tree is growing. As the trees offered are only\r\nseedlings, there is no certainty that they will produce nuts with\r\n\"thin shells.\" We can safely drop this supposed variety from the\r\nlist until something definite is known about it.\r\n\r\nJUGLANS CALIFORNICA, Watson. California Walnut.--Leaflets in from\r\nfive to eight pairs, more or less downy, but sometimes smooth,\r\noblong-lanceolate, sharp-pointed, narrowing upward from near the\r\nbase, two to two and a half inches long. Male catkins much larger\r\nthan in our Eastern species, or from four to eight inches, often in\r\npairs. Fruit round, slightly compressed, three-fourths to one inch\r\nand a quarter in diameter; husk thin, slightly dotted or roughened;\r\nshell dark brown, very faintly sculptured (Fig. 83), almost smooth,\r\nthick, the kernel filling two broad cavities upon each side; edible\r\nand fairly good. A tree or large shrub in the vicinity of San\r\nFrancisco and along the Sacramento (where it is sometimes\r\ncultivated), growing to the hight of forty to sixty feet, and two to\r\nfour feet in diameter; ranging southward to Santa Barbara, and\r\neastward through southern Arizona to New Mexico and Sonora (Thurber,\r\n\"Botany of California\"). This species has been considered by some\r\nbotanists as only a variety of the next, or _Juglans rupestris_,\r\nvar. _Major_, Torrey. Scarcely hardy in the latitude of New York\r\ncity, except an occasional seedling from nuts gathered along the\r\nnorthern limits of the species, or from the cooler elevated regions\r\nof the Pacific slope. It is of no special value, only adding one\r\nmore edible nut tree to the list.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83. JUGLANS CALIFORNICA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84. JUGLANS RUPESTRIS, SHOWING SMALL KERNEL.]\r\n\r\nJUGLANS RUPESTRIS, Engelmann. Texas Walnut. New Mexico\r\nWalnut.--Leaflets thirteen to twenty-five, smooth, bright green,\r\nsmall, narrow, and long-pointed; male catkins short, or about two\r\ninches long, and quite slender; fruit round or oblate; husk thin,\r\nnearly smooth; nut small, one-half to three-fourths of an inch in\r\ndiameter; shell very thick, rather deeply furrowed, the narrow\r\ngrooves on the greater part continuous from base to apex, the broad\r\nedges of the ridges smooth, not jagged as in the butternut and black\r\nwalnut. Kernel sweet and good, but so small (Fig. 84) as not to be\r\nworth the trouble of extracting. A small and neat tree twenty to\r\nforty feet high, native of the bottom lands of the Colorado in\r\nTexas, and throughout the western part of the State, extending\r\nthrough southern and central New Mexico to Arizona. In New Mexico it\r\nreaches an elevation of seven or eight thousand feet, though the\r\nclimate is often severe, the temperature dropping to zero and below\r\nduring the winter. Seedlings raised from nuts obtained near the\r\nnorthern limits of this species in Texas and New Mexico would\r\nprobably be hardy in most of the Northern States, but they are\r\nscarcely worth cultivating for their nuts, owing to the small size\r\nand thick shell; but as the trees are neat and graceful they are\r\nworthy of a place among other useful and ornamental kinds. An\r\noccasional bearing tree of this Texas walnut may be seen in the\r\ngardens and parks of the Eastern States, and probably in some of the\r\nWestern, but I have no direct information in regard to their\r\nlocations or age.\r\n\r\nSynonyms:\r\n\r\n  _Juglans rupestris_, Torrey.\r\n  _Juglans Californica_, Watson, Bot. California.\r\n\r\n=Oriental Walnuts.=--How few or many species of the walnut are\r\nindigenous to China, Korea, Japan and other Oriental countries it\r\nwould be very difficult to determine, with our present limited\r\nknowledge of the forests of that part of the world. The few\r\nbotanists who have had opportunities of studying the flora of those\r\nregions do not agree as to names or number of species of the genus.\r\nLoureiro, in his \"Flora Cochinchinensis\" (1788), names three species\r\nas indigenous to China, viz.: _Juglans regia_ in the northern part,\r\nbut this is now considered very doubtful; _Juglans Camirium_,\r\nRhumphius, a medium-sized, heart-shaped nut, the trees found in the\r\nforests, and also under cultivation; _Juglans Catappa_, a large\r\nforest tree in the Cochin China mountains, with oblong, edible nuts,\r\nwith husk and shell of nuts of a reddish color. Many years later\r\nSiebold describes a Japan walnut under the name of _Juglans\r\nJaponica_, and still later the Russian botanist, Maxiomowicz,\r\nrenames this, in honor of Siebold, _Juglans Sieboldiana_, and\r\ndescribes another native of Japan as _Juglans cordiformis_. But\r\nprior to any of the authors named, Thunberg had described a Japan\r\nwalnut under the name of _Juglans nigra_, probably the same as\r\nLoureiro's species, with reddish husk, but as this name had already\r\nbeen given to an American species it had to be dropped. Maxiomowicz\r\nalso describes what he supposed to be a distinct species, found in\r\nthe forests of Mandshuria under the name of _J. Mandshurica_ (1872),\r\nbut it is doubtful if it is anything more than one of the many wild\r\nforms of the species found widely distributed over eastern Asia. The\r\nred or black fruited walnut of Loureiro (_J. Catappa_), and\r\nSiebold's black walnut (_J. nigra_), are probably the same as the\r\nAilantus-leaved (_J. ailantifolia_), recently described in\r\nNicholson's \"Dictionary of Gardening,\" London, Eng., 1884, the\r\norigin of which is said to be uncertain. It is _Juglans\r\nMandshurica_, Maxim, in Alphonse Lavallee's \"Catalogue of Arboretum\r\nSegrezianum.\" As described in this work, the young fruit is\r\nviolet-red, and produced in long pendulous clusters, the latter\r\nbeing one of the marked characteristics of these Oriental walnuts.\r\nBut whether we admit that there is but one or a dozen species of\r\nthese Eastern walnuts, it cannot be of any special interest to the\r\npractical nut culturist, for to him their economic and commercial\r\nvalue is of more importance than scientific nomenclature.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time we have only succeeded in obtaining two\r\nspecies of these walnuts, or perhaps only one species and one\r\nvariety; but we certainly have two distinct forms, both coming from\r\nJapan, and distributed under the names given them by Maxiomowicz,\r\nviz.:\r\n\r\nJUGLANS SIEBOLDIANA (Siebold Walnut).--Leaflets sessile, usually\r\nfifteen, five to seven inches long, oblong-pointed, thin, soft,\r\ndowny, serratures very shallow, pale green above and somewhat\r\nlighter beneath; footstalks densely clothed with clammy hairs; fruit\r\nin long pendulous clusters of a half dozen to a dozen, one and a\r\nhalf inches or more long by a little more than one inch broad in the\r\nmiddle; husk thin, downy or clammy; nut somewhat compressed, the\r\npoint usually bending to one side; shell smooth, with two shallow\r\ngrooves from base upward on the sides opposite to the sharp,\r\nprominent ridges at the seams of the two lobes, the shell ending in\r\na strong, sharp point (Fig. 85). The shell is very hard and thick;\r\nthe kernel small, sweet, oily, resembling in taste our common\r\nbutternut; tree a rapid and stocky grower, the coarse shoots and\r\nlarge leaves resembling those of the Ailantus tree at first, but\r\nsoon spreading branches appear, forming an open, roundish head. The\r\nseedlings, as raised here, are abundantly supplied with small\r\nfibrous roots, which insures transplanting with safety. Apparently\r\nperfectly hardy in our Northern States, as I have heard no\r\ncomplaints of winter-killing of the young trees, although they are\r\nnow widely distributed and in considerable numbers, but none, so far\r\nas I have been able to learn, have reached a bearing age here in the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85. JUGLANS SIEBOLDIANA.]\r\n\r\nMr. P. C. Berckmans, of Augusta, Ga., in writing me under date of\r\nDec. 3, 1894, says:\r\n\r\n    \"Last year we fruited _Juglans Sieboldiana_ trees four years\r\n    from the seed. Fruit was produced in long clusters, and trees\r\n    exceedingly ornamental, but this year these same trees were\r\n    killed to the ground on the 26th of March, after they had set a\r\n    crop of fruit and made a young growth of more than twelve\r\n    inches. This untimely frost may not happen again in years, but\r\n    it goes to show that many varieties of trees which are\r\n    considered hardy further north, are sometimes destroyed here by\r\n    spring frosts.\"\r\n\r\nAs these Japanese and Chinese walnuts are natives of cold climates\r\nthey may be better adapted to the Northern than Southern States, but\r\nthere is no locality entirely exempt from late spring frosts, as\r\nmost farmers and fruit growers learned to their cost the past\r\nseason. There can be little doubt of this species of walnut being\r\nthe one described by Rhumphius under the name of _J. Camirium_, and\r\nmore fully later by Loureiro, as already noted; but having come to\r\nus from Japan as Siebold's walnut, this name will answer as well as\r\nany other, even if it is not the proper one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86. JUGLANS CORDIFORMIS.]\r\n\r\nJUGLANS CORDIFORMIS, Maxim.--In foliage and growth of tree this is\r\nalmost, if not absolutely, identical with the last; the difference\r\nobserved is in the nuts, which are also produced in pendulous\r\nclusters. The form of the nut is almost round (Fig. 86), rather\r\nblunt-pointed, but the shell is deeply and unevenly furrowed, and\r\nindented somewhat like our black walnut; the ridges, however, are\r\nnot as sharp. The specimens I have received from various sources are\r\nnot as large as the Siebold, and the shell not quite as thick, but\r\nthe kernel is small. I may note here that there appears to be some\r\nconfusion in regard to this variety or species, for in several\r\nnurserymen's catalogues this form of nut is figured as Siebold's,\r\nand the one that I have described under that name is called\r\n_Cordiformis_. The specimens received from California, Japan, and\r\nalso from Mr. Berckmans, correspond with the names here given, but\r\nfurther investigations may show that they should be reversed. The\r\none I have received as _Cordiformis_ is, doubtless, the nut\r\ndescribed by Loureiro as _J. Catappa_, as an ovate-oblong nut, with\r\na fibrous, leathery, reddish husk.\r\n\r\nWhile I do not suppose that these Oriental walnuts will ever become\r\nof any considerable commercial value, they are worth planting for\r\nshade and ornamental trees. They are rather precocious, coming into\r\nbearing at an early age, and the nuts are not only edible, but will\r\nalways be an acceptable addition to the unimportant although\r\nagreeable household supplies.\r\n\r\n=Persian Walnuts.= _Juglans regia_, Linn. Royal Walnut, Madeira Nut,\r\nEnglish Walnut, French Walnut, Chile Walnut, etc.--Leaflets five to\r\nnine, oval, smooth, pointed, slightly serrate; fruit round or\r\nslightly oval; husk thin, green, of a leathery texture, becoming\r\nbrittle and cleaving from the nut when ripe and dry; nut\r\nroundish-oval, smallest at the top; shell smooth, with slight\r\nindentations, thin, two-valved, readily parting at the seams; kernel\r\nlarge, wrinkled and corrugated, the two lobes separated below with a\r\nthin, papery partition, but united at the top; sweet, oily, and\r\ngenerally esteemed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87. SMALL FRUITED WALNUT.]\r\n\r\nThis species has been in cultivation many centuries, and in\r\ndifferent countries and climates, and under such variable conditions\r\nthat many of the varieties have departed widely from the normal\r\ntype. There are now an almost innumerable number of varieties,\r\nvarying greatly in size and form. Some are not larger than a\r\ngood-sized pea, as seen in the \"Small Fruited Walnut\" (Fig. 87),\r\nwhile others are nearly as large as a man's fist, as in the\r\nthick-shelled or \"Gibbous Walnut\" (Fig. 92), while in others the nut\r\nis greatly elongated, as in the \"Barthere Walnut\" (Fig. 88), and\r\nhundreds of other intermediate forms. There are also varieties that\r\nbloom early in spring, others late. Some are very hardy, others\r\nquite tender in cold climates. There are also dwarf and\r\ntall-growing, as well as the precocious and tardy fruiting\r\nvarieties. But very few of these have ever been cultivated in our\r\nEastern States, consequently little is known of their value here;\r\nbut more may be in the near future, when our horticulturists and\r\nfarmers begin to plant nut trees as freely as they have other kinds,\r\nor are awakened to the fact that such trees can be made a source of\r\npleasure and profit.\r\n\r\nHere in the Northern States our main dependence for hardy and\r\nproductive trees of this species will be upon seedlings or cions\r\nfrom those acclimated specimens which have already been thoroughly\r\ntested and found to be both hardy and prolific. There are plenty of\r\nthese, as I have stated elsewhere, and they are well worthy of\r\nattention and multiplication until something better is produced or\r\ndiscovered. In the meantime, the most promising European varieties\r\ncould be imported and tested, although it is not probable that those\r\noriginating in southern France and Italy would be of much value for\r\nplanting in the latitude of New York city or north of it, but south\r\nof this line the chances of success would be somewhat greater; and\r\nto escape injury from late spring frosts, the more elevated regions\r\nare preferable to the lower and warmer anywhere in the Southern\r\nStates. In anticipation of the question being asked, I will say\r\nthat, at present, I do not know of any nurseryman in the Eastern\r\nStates who propagates or imports named varieties of walnuts for\r\nsale. Of course, seedlings of these are offered, but it is well\r\nknown that there is but a remote chance of these coming true from\r\nseed. Even the little dwarf French walnut _Praeparturiens_, or Early\r\nProlific, cannot be depended upon to produce dwarf or early bearing\r\ntrees beyond the first generation from the nut, and these must be\r\nthe product of grafted trees, to insure this much. The following\r\nlist contains the names of only a few of the most noted varieties,\r\nthe greater part having originated in Europe.\r\n\r\nAILANTUS-LEAVED WALNUT. See Oriental walnuts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88. BARTHERE WALNUT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89. CHABERTE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90. CHILE WALNUT.]\r\n\r\nBARTHERE WALNUTS. See Fig. 88.--A very long nut, pointed at both\r\nends. Shell thin; kernel large and of excellent flavor. Named after\r\nM. Barthere, a horticulturist of Toulouse, France, who discovered it\r\ngrowing among a number of other trees; consequently, its origin is a\r\nmystery. M. Barthere says that it is very productive, and even the\r\nseedlings of this variety begin to bear very early.\r\n\r\nCHABERTE.--An old standard French variety, of an oval shape; medium\r\nsize, with very full and rich flavored kernel (Fig. 89). The tree\r\nbuds and blooms late, therefore especially valuable in localities\r\nwhere late spring frosts are likely to occur.\r\n\r\nCHILE WALNUT.--This name is given, in a general way, to all the\r\nwalnuts received in our markets from South America. The nuts are\r\nusually of good size, with a dark grayish shell; thin but firm, with\r\nplump kernels of excellent flavor. These nuts arrive in February and\r\nMarch. Many of the Chile walnuts have three valves (Fig. 90),\r\ninstead of the normal two. Such freaks are occasionally found among\r\nthe European varieties, also in the native hickories, but these\r\ntri-valved nuts appear to be very abundant among the Chile walnuts.\r\n\r\nCLUSTER WALNUT. RACEMOSA OR SPICATA.--Described by Mr. Gillet as a\r\nvariety of the Persian walnut, producing medium, thin-shelled nuts\r\nin long clusters of from eight to twenty-eight. He also says that he\r\nintroduced it into this country, but from whence we are not\r\ninformed. Lavellee (1877) records it as a variety of _J. regia_,\r\nunder the name of _racemosa_, giving its synonym as _Juglans\r\nCalifornica_ of the horticulturists. I have not found it mentioned\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91. CUT-LEAVED WALNUT.]\r\n\r\nCUT-LEAVED WALNUT.--A variety with deeply cut leaves; very\r\nornamental, as seen in Fig. 91. Nuts quite small, but of good\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nFRANQUETTE.--Another old standard French variety, with large,\r\nelongated-oval nuts with a distinct point. Shell thin; kernel large,\r\nand of rich flavor. The tree blooms late; valuable for planting in\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nGANT OR BIJOU WALNUT.--A remarkable variety on account of its\r\nextraordinary size. The shell is thin, with rather deep furrows,\r\nthose of the largest size being made into ladies' companions, where\r\nto stow away gloves or handkerchiefs, hence the name \"Gant\" walnut.\r\nThe kernel, though, does not correspond to the size of the shell\r\n(Gillet).\r\n\r\nGIBBOUS WALNUT (Fig. 92).--This is a very large variety, supposed to\r\nbe a hybrid, raised in France many years ago. It is of little value,\r\nas the shell is very thick and kernel small. Valuable mainly for its\r\nimmense size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92. GIBBOUS WALNUT.]\r\n\r\nKAGHAZI.--This is supposed to be a variety of the Persian walnut, of\r\nfair size, with a very thin shell. The tree blooms very late in\r\nspring, and for this reason is recommended for localities where\r\nthere is danger from injury by frost. The tree is said to be a very\r\nrapid grower, and much more hardy than the general run of varieties\r\nof this species. I have been unable to learn its origin, but it has\r\nbeen planted quite extensively in California, and some of our\r\nEastern nurserymen are offering the seedling trees for sale, but\r\nwhether they will possess the merits of the original or not must be\r\ndetermined by experience.\r\n\r\nLARGE-FRUITED PRAEPARTURIENS.--A sub-variety of the Praeparturiens,\r\noriginating with Mr. Felix Gillet of California.\r\n\r\nLATE PRAEPARTURIENS.--Also originated with Mr. Gillet. Valuable\r\nbecause the trees bloom late in spring. Nuts described as of medium\r\nsize, but with full kernels of excellent quality.\r\n\r\nMAYETTE.--Very large (Fig. 93), with a light-colored shell of\r\nmoderate thickness. Kernel plump, readily extracted whole, as shown\r\nin Fig. 94, sweet, and a rich, nutty flavor. Tree blooms late and is\r\nvery productive. An old and standard French variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93. MAYETTE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94. KERNEL OF WALNUT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95. J. REGIA OCTOGONA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96. CROSS SECTION.]\r\n\r\nMESANGE OR PAPER-SHELL.--This nut has the thinnest shell of any\r\nvariety known; it derives its name of Mesange from a little lark of\r\nthat name, that goes to the kernel through the tender shell. Tree\r\nvery productive, and the kernel quite rich in oil. We do not,\r\nhowever, recommend the growing of this variety for market, on\r\naccount of the thinness of the shell, which breaks off too easily in\r\nhandling the nuts, or even when they drop on the ground (Felix\r\nGillet).\r\n\r\nMEYLAN WALNUT.--A French variety that originated near the little\r\nvillage of Meylan, in the vicinity of which it is quite extensively\r\ncultivated for home use and export.\r\n\r\nOCTOGONA.--Of uncertain origin, but very much resembles one of the\r\nOriental species in the form and sculpture of the shell (Fig. 95).\r\nThe shell is also very thick, as shown in the cross section (Fig.\r\n96). Of no special value.\r\n\r\nPARISIENNE WALNUT.--Although this was named for the city of Paris it\r\ndid not originate there, but in the South of France. It is a large\r\nand rather broad variety, with a firm but thin shell (Fig. 97) and\r\nexcellent flavored kernel. It is reported that this variety succeeds\r\nin California, also in the South wherever tried. The trees leaf out\r\nlate in spring and are rarely injured by frosts, and are remarkably\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97. PARISIENNE.]\r\n\r\nPRAEPARTURIENS. Precocious Dwarf Prolific.--A French variety of a\r\ndwarf habit, and the plants noted for bearing when very young. A\r\ncorrespondent of _The Garden_ (London, Eng.), referring to this\r\nvariety some years ago, says:\r\n\r\n    \"It is precocious on account of the singular and exceptional\r\n    fact that it is born almost an adult; in fact, it is nothing\r\n    uncommon to see a tree in its third year bearing excellent\r\n    fruit.\"\r\n\r\nHe does not say, however, whether he refers to seedlings or grafted\r\nplants, but we may presume the latter or those raised from layers,\r\nfor cultivators who have experimented with seedlings have found that\r\nthey possess a strong tendency to revert to the original or tree\r\nform. This may not show itself very strongly in the first generation\r\nif the nuts are obtained from grafted trees of some age, but in the\r\nsecond and third generation the early-fruiting and dwarf are usually\r\nentirely lost. The only certain way of securing the true variety is\r\nby grafting or layering, but it is to be feared that very few trees\r\npropagated by these modes are in cultivation, at least in the\r\nEastern States, although nurserymen have been offering Praeparturiens\r\nwalnut trees in their catalogues during the past fifty years. In one\r\nnow before me, published in New York city in 1844, trees of this\r\nwalnut are offered at one dollar each, or about what is charged for\r\nseedlings at the present time. As nothing is said in the catalogues\r\nabout the mode of propagation, we infer that they are seedlings, as\r\ngrafted trees would be worth more than one dollar. The nuts of this\r\ndwarf walnut are of medium size, thin-shelled and of excellent\r\nflavor; valuable for gardens of limited extent.\r\n\r\nSEROTINA. Late Walnut, St. John Walnut.--A very peculiar sort,\r\ninasmuch as it is the latest of all to bud and bloom in spring, and\r\nyet it pushes forward so rapidly that the nuts are ripe with others\r\nin the fall. They are of medium size (Fig. 98), with a rather hard\r\nshell, but the kernel is plump and good flavored. The tree is very\r\nproductive, and sure to escape late spring frosts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98. SEROTINA OR ST. JOHN.]\r\n\r\nVILMORIN.--This is claimed to be a hybrid between some variety of\r\n_J. regia_ and our native black walnut, _J. nigra_. Scarcely known\r\noutside of France.\r\n\r\nVOUREY.--A new and splendid variety raised near Vourey, a small town\r\nin southeast France. It has much the same shape and qualities of the\r\nParisienne walnut (Gillet).\r\n\r\nVARIEGATED WALNUT.--A handsome variety, with young branches covered\r\nwith dark-green bark spotted with gray, and often striped\r\nlongitudinally with yellow. The leaves resemble those of the common\r\nwalnut; the fruit is of a light yellowish-green streaked with darker\r\ngreen, and reminds one closely of certain varieties of pears which,\r\nin common with this variety, frequently have their young branches\r\nstriped in a similar manner. Propagated by grafting or layers. (_The\r\nGarden._)\r\n\r\nWEEPING WALNUT.--A tree with pendulous twigs and branches. Quite\r\nornamental, but not especially valuable for its fruit. Hardy in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those described, there are a large number of\r\nvarieties, which may be worth importing and testing in this country,\r\nby those who may feel inclined to make experiments with these nuts.\r\nProbably some of those highly extolled by earlier writers are now\r\nlost, but this cannot be determined until a careful search through\r\nthe old European gardens has been made.\r\n\r\nAmong the early-fruiting or precocious varieties we find an account\r\nof one raised by Anthony Carlisle, of England, as recorded in a\r\npaper read at a meeting of the Horticultural Society of London,\r\nMarch 3, 1812. Mr. Carlisle planted six nuts in March, 1802, these\r\nhaving been received from Mr. Thomas Wedgewood of Blandford. Six\r\nyears later, or in 1808, one of the seedlings bore and matured ten\r\nwalnuts, and the next season (1809) upwards of fifty, and in 1810\r\none hundred and twelve, the tree at that age being nineteen feet\r\nseven and one-half inches high. Another variety, under the name of\r\nHighflyer walnut, is described in the Transactions of the same\r\nsociety, Vol. IV, 1822, p. 517. The nuts sent to the society were\r\ngrown in the town of Thetford, and are described as a long oval,\r\nwith a shell so very thin that the slightest pressure of the fingers\r\ncrushes it. I find that this Highflyer walnut is mentioned in the\r\nrecently published \"Dictionary of Gardening,\" but whether obtainable\r\nin English nurseries or not we are left in doubt.\r\n\r\nI refer to these English varieties mainly to show that some of the\r\nvery best and thinnest-shelled walnuts have been grown in cool\r\nclimates, and are not confined entirely to the warm or\r\nsemi-tropical, as many persons seem to suppose and even claim to be\r\nthe fact. It is principally from these English walnuts, as they are\r\nusually termed, that our hardy old-bearing trees, referred to\r\nelsewhere, have been produced, and, doubtless, many more will be,\r\nwhen we begin to pay some attention to this very valuable nut. It is\r\nalso quite likely that when our horticulturists look about for\r\nchoice acclimated varieties for propagation, they will be found\r\nright here in the grounds of next-door neighbors, and there may be\r\nno necessity of sending to Europe or elsewhere for either nuts or\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nAt present there is much confusion and uncertainty in regard to the\r\nidentity and nomenclature of both species and varieties of the\r\nwalnut, and it must remain so until they are collected from all\r\ncountries and climes, of which they are either native or into which\r\nthey have been introduced, and when so collected, and fruiting\r\nspecimens produce, it will not be difficult to classify and\r\ndetermine their synonyms. This will be an undertaking scarcely to be\r\nexpected of the individual nut culturist, but is within the\r\nlegitimate line of the arboretum, and of public botanical gardens\r\nlocated in both cold and warm climates, thereby securing a division\r\nof labor, and at the same time avoiding the uncertainty of trying to\r\nproduce practical results under uncongenial conditions and\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n=Husking Walnuts.=--The husks of nearly all the varieties of the\r\nPersian and Oriental walnuts part from their shells freely when\r\nfully ripened and dried, but in a few varieties the husks are rather\r\npersistent, requiring force and friction for their removal. This may\r\nbe accomplished by placing them in bags and shaking, or in barrels\r\nand rolling, until the nuts are scraped clean. But the better way,\r\nwhere there is any considerable quantity of nuts to be operated\r\nupon, is to take a strong barrel or cask, and so arrange it on\r\nstandards that it can be rapidly revolved with a crank attached to\r\none end. Of course, the cask must have its two heads left in place,\r\nand an opening made in the side to admit the nuts and remove them\r\nwhen cleaned. Almost any man handy with tools can make such a\r\ncleaner and polisher in a few hours, and if stored in a dry place it\r\nwill last for several years. With butternuts and black walnuts the\r\nhusks are much tougher, and they should be thrown into heaps in the\r\nopen air, and turned over occasionally until the husks become\r\nsoftened sufficiently to permit of their removal, in case they are\r\nto be sent to market. Ordinary threshing machines may be used for\r\ncleaning the husks from black walnuts, by removing about one-half\r\nthe teeth, or enough to allow the nuts to pass through without\r\nbreaking their shells.\r\n\r\nMost of the hickories drop from the husk, leaving the nut clean; but\r\nin some varieties of the pecan the inner part of the husk adheres\r\nrather tenaciously, and they sell better if cleaned; besides, some\r\nhave rather rough and thick shells, and a little scraping and\r\npolishing adds much to their appearance. The revolving cask, either\r\nworked by hand or other power, is an excellent implement for\r\npreparing these nuts for market, and if the husk is very persistent,\r\na little dry sand thrown in will aid in cleaning and polishing.\r\nSometimes these nuts are subjected to what is called the soapstone\r\npolish, leaving the shells very smooth, with a greasy feel. The\r\nFrench walnuts, which are extensively imported under the general\r\nname of Grenoble walnuts, are usually bleached with sulphur before\r\nthey are shipped, and while this adds nothing to the quality of the\r\nkernel, the sulphur is an excellent insecticide and fungicide, and\r\nmay be of some use on that account; but otherwise it is likely to be\r\nmore injurious than beneficial. As bleaching both walnuts and\r\nalmonds is often insisted upon by dealers, I give the process\r\nsuggested by Director Hilgard, of the California Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station, which he believes will prove more satisfactory\r\nthan the one usually employed, and is as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"The nuts, placed in small baskets (such as the Chinese use for\r\n    carrying), are dipped for about five minutes in a solution\r\n    containing to every fifty gallons of water six pounds of\r\n    bleaching powder and twelve pounds of sal soda. They are then\r\n    rinsed with a hose, and after draining, again dipped into\r\n    another solution containing one per cent of bisulphite of lime;\r\n    after the nuts have assumed the desired tint, they are again\r\n    rinsed with water and then dried. Instead of the second dipping,\r\n    the nuts may be sulphured (fumigated) for ten or fifteen\r\n    minutes. The cost of fifty gallons of chlorine dip will be about\r\n    forty cents; the same bulk of the bisulphite dip, probably\r\n    considerably less. The time occupied in handling one batch (two\r\n    dips) is from twelve to fifteen minutes.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99. THE CATERPILLAR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100. THE REGAL WALNUT MOTH--CITHERONIA REGALIS.]\r\n\r\n=Insect Enemies.=--The walnut is attacked by the same kinds of\r\ninsects that infest the hickories, with, perhaps, a few exceptions;\r\nas, for instance, the bark beetles and the nut weevils. The leaves\r\nappear to be more or less acceptable food for the caterpillars that\r\nfeed on the hickories, and the same insecticides and means employed\r\nfor destroying these pests on one will answer for the other.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of some of the smaller kinds of moths are, as a\r\nrule, far more destructive to the leaves than the larger, and their\r\nravages often escape notice until it is too late for the use of\r\npreventives, or for their destruction with insecticides.\r\n\r\nEver since I became connected with the New York city press, some\r\nthirty odd years ago, scarcely a season has passed during which one\r\nor more specimens of the Regal walnut caterpillar (_Citheronia\r\nregalis_), shown in Fig. 99, have not been received from some\r\ncorrespondent who had found them crawling down the stem or on the\r\nground near a walnut tree. Such a large caterpillar would naturally\r\nattract the attention of almost any person, but to the timid its\r\nappearance is exceedingly ferocious and repulsive, while to the\r\nentomologist it is a beautiful and interesting creature, and far\r\nmore likely to be handled with care than injured. This caterpillar\r\nis of a green color, and transversely banded across each of the\r\nrings with pale blue. The head and legs are of an orange color, also\r\nthe long spine or horns, with the points tipped with black. It is\r\ncertainly very formidable in appearance, but perfectly harmless, and\r\nmay be handled with impunity. The parent moth (Fig. 100) has fore\r\nwings of an olive color, ornamented with small yellow spots and\r\nveined with red lines. The hind wings are orange-red, with two large\r\nirregular yellow patches before, and a row of wedge-shaped olive\r\ncolored spots between the veins behind. Although this insect appears\r\nto be widely distributed over the country, and the caterpillars feed\r\non the walnuts and occasionally on the hickory, it has never been\r\nknown to be sufficiently numerous to attract any special attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS NUTS--EDIBLE AND OTHERWISE.\r\n\r\nIn the following list of plants there are a few that in no way can\r\nbe considered as related to the true nut-bearing trees and shrubs;\r\nbut as the word \"nut\" has been attached as a prefix or affix in\r\ncommerce, or elsewhere, they are admitted, even if for no other\r\npurpose than to designate their true position in the vegetable\r\nkingdom. For convenience, they are recorded in alphabetical order,\r\nthe most familiar of the common names--where there are more than\r\none--being given precedence, the botanical or scientific following,\r\nwith a brief description, as my limited space will not permit of\r\nanything more extended.\r\n\r\nIt is not claimed that this catalogue of nuts is complete, but it is\r\nprobably as near it as any heretofore compiled and published, and it\r\nmay serve as the basis for a better and more extended one at some\r\nfuture time.\r\n\r\nACORN, OR OAK NUT.--The fruit of the oak, Quercus (_Cupuliferae_),\r\nmonoecious, evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs, with alternate\r\nand simple straight-veined leaves. A very large genus, of about two\r\nhundred and fifty species, mainly in the temperate region of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere. There are some forty species native of the\r\nUnited States. The nuts are, on the whole, rather too harsh and\r\nbitter flavored to be esteemed or considered edible by civilized\r\nnations at the present day, but in former times some of the oak nuts\r\nwere often an important article among the garnered food of the\r\nhousehold. They were used--and are still, in some countries--boiled,\r\nroasted, and even ground and made into bread and cakes. They have\r\nalso been used as a substitute for coffee, and for malt in making\r\nbeer. Strabo says that in the mountains of Spain the inhabitants\r\nground their acorns into meal, and Pliny affirms that in his time\r\nacorns were brought to the table with the dessert, in Spain. Every\r\nstudent of English history is well aware of the importance of the\r\nacorn, not only as food for man, in Great Britain, in the time of\r\nthe Druids, and later, but also for feeding swine, deer, and other\r\nwild and domesticated animals. But with the advance of civilization\r\nand the production of better food, the oak nut ceased to be classed\r\namong the important culinary supplies. There are, however, a few\r\nspecies of the oak yielding nuts fairly edible in their raw state,\r\nand these are much improved by roasting. The best of those among our\r\nnative species are to be found in the varieties of the white oaks of\r\nthe North, and in the evergreen (_Quercus virens_) of the Southern\r\nStates. But with so many far superior species of edible nuts, it is\r\nvery doubtful if any of the oaks will ever be cultivated for their\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIAN CHESTNUT.--The seeds of a large tree, native of\r\nAustralia, the _Castanospermum australe_, the name of the genus\r\nbeing derived from _Kastanon_, chestnut, and _sperma_, a seed,\r\nbecause the seeds resemble, in size and taste, the common chestnut.\r\nBut the tree belongs to the bean family (_Leguminosae_), and the\r\nseeds are produced in large, long pods. They are about an inch and a\r\nhalf broad, somewhat flattened, and of the color of a chestnut when\r\nripe. They are roasted and eaten by the natives, but are rather\r\nunpalatable to those who have been accustomed to something better in\r\nthe way of edible nuts. These seeds are also known as \"Moreton Bay\r\nchestnuts.\"\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIAN HAZELNUT.--The fruit of _Macadamia ternifolia_\r\n(_Proteaceae_). There are two species, both evergreen trees or tall\r\nshrubs confined to eastern Australia. The fruit is a kind of drupe\r\nwith a fleshy exterior, enclosing a hard shelled nut, not unlike a\r\nsmall walnut. The kernel, when mature, has a rich and agreeable\r\nflavor, much like but richer than the hazelnut, hence one of its\r\nlocal names, for it is also known as \"Queensland nut.\" This nut tree\r\nwould probably thrive in southern Florida, and in the warmer parts\r\nof California.\r\n\r\nBEN NUT.--Fruit of _Moringa aptera_ (_Moringeae_). Small, unarmed\r\ntrees; only three species in the order, these inhabiting tropical\r\nAsia, northern Africa and the West Indies. The one producing the ben\r\nnuts grows from fifteen to twenty feet high, and is found in upper\r\nEgypt, Syria and Arabia. The seeds,--or nuts, as they are\r\ncalled,--are produced in capsules or seed-pods about a foot long,\r\nand while not edible, an oil is expressed from them which is largely\r\nused in the manufacture of perfumery, and known in commerce as ben\r\noil. Another species, the _M. pterygosperma_, or winged-seeded\r\nMoringa, is known as the horse-radish tree, the bark of the roots\r\nbeing used as a substitute for horse-radish.\r\n\r\nBETEL NUT OR PINANG.--The fruit of a lofty palm, _Areca Catechu_\r\n(_Palmaceae_). A native of Cochin China, the Malayan Peninsula, and\r\nadjacent islands. A slender-stemmed palm, with regular pinnate\r\nleaves and long, narrow leaflets. The fruit is produced on an erect,\r\nfleshy spike, each fruit about the size of a hen's egg, with a\r\nthick, fibrous rind or husk, enclosing a hard nut somewhat like an\r\nordinary nutmeg. These are used by being cut into small pieces or\r\nslices, then rolled up in a leaf of the betel pepper (_Piper\r\nbetel_), a little lime sprinkled over it, and then chewed or held in\r\nthe mouth, as practiced by those who use tobacco for chewing. This\r\nhabit of chewing the betel nut is said to be almost universal among\r\nthe Malayan races, all carrying a box containing the nut leaf and\r\nlime. These nuts are shipped in large quantities to countries where\r\nthey do not grow, and the habit of chewing them has spread\r\nenormously, of late years, and is likely to increase, as it has with\r\ntobacco; and the effect upon the users is said to be very similar,\r\nalthough some authorities claim that the betel is the most injurious\r\nof the two, having a far more deleterious effect upon the teeth and\r\ngums. But this may be due to the use of the lime. Travelers in\r\ncountries where these nuts are in common use tell wonderful tales\r\nabout the invigorating effects of the betel, and how their\r\nassistants and followers are enabled, by its use, to perform the\r\nmost exhausting labor for days at a time, which, without it, would\r\nbe impossible. We have no doubt that the users of tobacco will claim\r\njust as much for this narcotic weed, and probably could produce as\r\nmany trustworthy witnesses in support of it. The betel is, like\r\ntobacco, a narcotic stimulant, and causes giddiness in persons\r\nunaccustomed to it, excoriates the mouth, and is so burning that\r\nWestern nations will be slow to adopt this Eastern habit.\r\n\r\nBLADDER NUT.--A rather inappropriate name for the seed pods and\r\nsmall seeds of one of our common large deciduous shrubs, the\r\n_Staphylea trifolia_. It is sometimes planted for ornament. The\r\nsmall white flowers are produced in hanging racemes, succeeded by\r\nlarge bladdery pods, hence its common name.\r\n\r\nBRAZIL NUT.--The fruit of _Bertholletia excelsa_, a lofty tree of\r\nthe myrtle family (_Myrtaceae_). The tree attains a height of from\r\none hundred to one hundred and fifty feet, with stems three to four\r\nfeet in diameter. The leaves are broad, smooth, and about two feet\r\nlong, rather thick, and of the texture of leather. The fruit is\r\nproduced mainly on the uppermost branches, and is globular, four to\r\nsix inches in diameter, with a brittle husk on the outside, and\r\nwithin this a hard, tough, woody shell, fully one-half inch thick,\r\ncontaining a large number of the closely packed, three-sided, rough\r\nnuts, about an inch and a half to two inches or over in length, as\r\nseen in Fig. 101. The kernels are very white, solid and oily. When\r\nmature the fruit falls entire, and the natives of the country\r\ncollect them, splitting the shells to obtain the nuts. An occasional\r\nentire fruit is sent to other countries, as a curiosity, or for the\r\ncabinet of some botanist. The Brazil nut is not only indigenous to\r\nBrazil, but also of Guiana, Venezuela (forming immense forests on\r\nthe Orinoco, where they are called Juvia), and southward on the Rio\r\nNegra and in the valley of the Amazon. In fact, the supply appears\r\nto be inexhaustible; the only difficulty is in getting the nuts from\r\nthe forests to some point where they can be shipped out of the\r\ncountry. The principal export is from Para, but there are many\r\nsmaller cities and towns where a load of these nuts may be obtained\r\non short notice. A very superior oil may be obtained from the nuts,\r\nby pressure, but the principal use for them is for desserts and\r\nconfectionery. They are always abundant in our city markets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101. BRAZIL NUT.]\r\n\r\nBREAD NUT.--The fruit of a large tree, the _Brosimum Alicastrum_, of\r\nthe bread fruit family (_Artocarpaceae_), native of the West Indies,\r\nbut best known in Jamaica. The botanical authorities disagree in\r\nregard to this species, some claiming that it is a large tree, with\r\nwood similar to mahogany; others that it is only a small shrub, only\r\nfive or six feet high. It has lance-shaped leaves, male and female\r\nflowers in globular heads, and usually on separate trees. The fruit\r\nis about the size of a plum, containing one seed or nut, which is\r\nonly edible after roasting.\r\n\r\nBUFFALO NUT.--See Oil nut.\r\n\r\nBUTTERNUT.--See Souari nut.\r\n\r\nBYZANTIUM NUT.--See Filberts, Chap. VI.\r\n\r\nCANDLE NUTS.--A small evergreen tree, the _Aleurites triloba_ of the\r\nspurgewort family (_Euphorbiaceae_). It is a native of most warm\r\ncountries of the East: India, Malay, southern Japan, and nearly all\r\nthe islands of the Pacific ocean, and in some of these it is\r\ncultivated for the fruit, which is about two inches in diameter. In\r\nthe center there is a hard nut, very oily, with the flavor of the\r\nwalnut. The oil obtained from these nuts is in common use among the\r\nnatives of the Polynesian islands. In the Hawaiian group the kernels\r\nare strung on a small, dry stick, which serves the purpose of a\r\nwick, and then one end lighted, as with an ordinary tallow or wax\r\ncandle, hence probably the common name of candle nut. These nuts are\r\nsaid to be used in the same way in India. Large quantities of oil is\r\nalso expressed from them and used for various purposes, and\r\noccasionally small quantities are exported to European countries.\r\n\r\nCAPE CHESTNUT.--The name of a beautiful evergreen ornamental tree,\r\nnative of south Africa, and recently introduced into European\r\ngardens from the Cape of Good Hope, hence its common, and its\r\nspecific scientific name, _Calodendron capense_. It belongs to the\r\nRue family (_Rutaceae_). The flowers are red, produced in long\r\nterminal racemes, the tree growing about forty feet high, and said\r\nto be one of the finest trees of that part of Africa. It is now\r\nunder trial in Florida. Why called a chestnut I have been unable to\r\ndiscover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102. THE CASHEW NUT.]\r\n\r\nCASHEW NUT.--A large shrub or small tree, native of the West Indies,\r\nand for this reason often referred to as the \"Western Cashew,\" or\r\n_Anacardium occidentale_. It belongs to the Terebinth family\r\n(_Anacardium_), consequently is closely related to our native poison\r\nsumachs (_Rhus_). The tree is an evergreen, with entire\r\nfeather-veined leaves; flowers of a reddish color, very small,\r\nsweet-scented, and produced in terminal panicles. The fruit is\r\nkidney-shaped, and borne on a fleshy receptacle, and when ripe of\r\nreddish or yellow color. The nut proper is enclosed in a leathery\r\ncovering, consisting of two layers, between which is deposited a\r\nthick, caustic, oily substance, exceedingly acrid; but this is\r\neliminated by heat, so that when the kernels are roasted they have a\r\npleasant flavor and are highly esteemed for dessert. Some care is\r\nrequired in roasting these nuts, as the fumes given off during this\r\noperation cause inflammation of the eyes. The nuts also yield an\r\nexcellent oil, very similar to the best olive oil. Although\r\noriginally found only in the West Indies, this nut is now widely\r\ndistributed throughout the tropical countries of the East; in fact,\r\nnaturalized in all hot climates, and is also under trial in southern\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\nCAUCASIAN WALNUT. WINGED WALNUT.--The winged fruit of _Pterocarya\r\nfraxinifolia_, also known as _P. Caucasica_ of nurserymen's\r\ncatalogues. It belongs to the walnut family (_Juglandaceae_), and is\r\na tree growing thirty to forty feet high, somewhat resembling the\r\ncommon ash (_Fraxinus_). It is a pretty, hardy, ornamental tree,\r\nthriving only in moist soils. Seeds on winged nuts produced in long,\r\ndrooping racemes, but of no special value. Introduced into England\r\nfrom Caucasus in 1800, and now plentiful here in nurseries.\r\n\r\nCHESTNUT.--See Chapter V; also Horse-chestnut, and Moreton Bay,\r\nTahiti and Water chestnuts.\r\n\r\nCHOCOLATE NUT OR BEAN.--The seeds of a small tropical tree,\r\n_Theobroma Cacao_, of the chocolate nut family (_Sterculiaceae_).\r\nIndigenous to tropical America, but now cultivated more or less\r\nextensively in all hot climates. The tree grows from fifteen to\r\ntwenty feet high, with long, pointed, smooth leaves. The flowers are\r\nsmall, yellow, and produced from the old wood of both stems and\r\nbranches, succeeded by a pod-like fruit six to ten or more inches\r\nlong, containing fifty to a hundred seeds, resembling beans more\r\nthan they do nuts. When the fruit is ripe it is gathered, at which\r\ntime the seeds are covered with a gum-like substance, and to remove\r\nthis they are subjected to a slight fermentation, after which they\r\nare dried in the sun, this giving them their usual brown color.\r\nChocolate nut trees are extensively cultivated in Brazil, New\r\nGrenada, Trinidad, and, in fact, throughout tropical America, and\r\ntheir cultivation is, upon the whole, very profitable, as the demand\r\nis almost unlimited.\r\n\r\nCLEARING NUT.--This is an East India name for the seeds of\r\n_Strychnos potatorum_, a plant belonging to the well-known nux\r\nvomica family (_Loganiaceae_). It is a small tree, native of India,\r\nthe wood of which is used for various purposes. The fruit is about\r\nthe size of a cherry, and contains one seed; this is dried, and used\r\nfor clearing muddy water, this being effected by rubbing one of the\r\nlittle nuts around the sides of the vessel that is to be filled,\r\nafter which the water is poured in, and then, through some unknown\r\nagency, all the foreign matter settles, leaving the liquid perfectly\r\npure, clear and wholesome.\r\n\r\nCOCOANUT.--One of the most widely-known and largest of edible nuts;\r\nthe product of _Cocos nucifera_, a lofty, tree-like palm (_Palmae_ or\r\n_Palmaceae_). It is a native of tropical Africa, India, Malay, and of\r\nnearly all the islands of the Indian and Pacific oceans. It only\r\nthrives near the seacoast or where the sea breezes reach it,\r\nrequiring no special care after the nuts and young plants once\r\nbecome established in a congenial soil. The coco palm grows from\r\nfifty to one hundred feet high, with pinnate leaves from ten to\r\ntwenty feet long. The nuts are produced in clusters of a dozen or\r\nmore, and when full grown are somewhat triangular and a foot long,\r\nthe outer coat or husk composed of a tough fiber. The nuts, when\r\ncleaned of their husks, are too well known to call for a further\r\ndescription here. In countries where these nuts are plentiful, their\r\ncontents form nearly the entire food of the natives, the milky fluid\r\nserving for drink, and the more solid parts as a substitute for meat\r\nand bread. The cocoa-nut utilized in more ways, and for a greater\r\nvariety of purposes, than any other kind known, and it would require\r\na volume to briefly enumerate them. Of recent years there have been\r\nplantations made of this nut on the coast of southern Florida, and\r\none of the most extensive of these is by a man from New Jersey, but\r\nI have not heard from him of late, or seen any reports as to the\r\nresults of his experiments. It is reported that there are about\r\n250,000 cocoa-nut trees now growing in Florida.\r\n\r\nCOCOANUT, DOUBLE.--This is the fruit of another lofty palm,\r\n_Lodoicea Sechellarum_, and is usually considered the largest member\r\nof the order. It is a native of the Seychelles islands, in the\r\nIndian ocean. It is said to reach a hight of a hundred feet, with a\r\nstem two feet in diameter. The fruit is a large, oblong nut, with a\r\nrather thin rind or husk, and when this is removed the nut appears\r\nto be double, or two oblong nuts firmly united, a kind of twin\r\nformation, the entire nut weighing from thirty to forty pounds.\r\nThese immense nuts are produced in bunches of eight to ten, the\r\ncluster sometimes weighing from three to four hundred pounds. It is\r\nsupposed that these nuts require about ten years to grow and mature.\r\nThey are useless as food, but the shells are manufactured into\r\nvarious useful articles by the natives, and they are also\r\ntransported to other countries and valued as curiosities. There is a\r\ngreat demand for the leaves of this palm for making hats, baskets,\r\netc., and as the trees have to be cut down to obtain them, they are\r\nbecoming rather scarce.\r\n\r\nCOLA NUT, KOLA NUT OR GOORA NUT.--The fruit of a small tree, native\r\nof the warmer parts of western Africa, and known to botanists as\r\n_Cola acuminata_, and of the Sterculiad family (_Sterculiaceae_). In\r\nits native country it grows thirty to forty feet high. The leaves\r\nare oblong-elliptical, six to eight inches long, and pointed\r\n(acuminate), and from this it probably derived its specific name.\r\nThe flowers are yellow, and produced in axillary racemes, and\r\nsucceeded by simple bean-like pods, each containing several nut-like\r\nseeds, which the natives call cola or goora nuts. These nuts have\r\nlong been an article of trade among the native tribes of Africa,\r\nthey being valued for their supposed efficacy in allaying thirst,\r\npromoting digestion, giving strength, and preventing exhaustion\r\nduring the performance of hard manual labor. This tree was early\r\nintroduced into the West Indies and Brazil, but its reputation in\r\nAfrica does not appear to have been sustained it its Western\r\nhabitat.\r\n\r\nCOQUILLA NUT.--The fruit of the Piassaba palm, _Attalea funifera_, a\r\nnative of Brazil, where it grows about thirty feet high. The fruit\r\nis produced in bunches, and are each about three inches long,\r\ncovered with a thin rind. The nut is very hard, and is used as a\r\nsubstitute for bone and ivory in the manufacture of articles for the\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\nCOQUITO NUT.--This is the fruit of the wing-leaved palm of Chile,\r\nJUBAEA SPECTABILIS. It is a moderately tall species, and closely\r\nresembles, in general habit, the date palm. The nuts are edible, but\r\nthey are of secondary importance, this palm being valued mainly for\r\nthe sweet sap issuing from the stem when cut down, this continuing\r\nto exude from it for weeks after it is severed from the roots. The\r\nsap is gathered and boiled, and when reduced to the consistency of\r\nmolasses becomes an article of commerce, under the name of Meil de\r\nPalma or palm honey.\r\n\r\nCREAM NUT.--A local name of Brazil nut.\r\n\r\nDAWA NUT.--See Litchi nut.\r\n\r\nEARTH NUT, OR EARTH CHESTNUT, ETC.--A small, low-growing, herbaceous\r\nplant of the carrot family (_Umbelliferae_), common in waste or\r\nuncultivated grounds in Great Britain and other countries of\r\nnorthern Europe. Formerly botanists supposed there were two species,\r\nbut of late only one, the _Bunium bulbocastanum_. On the roots there\r\nare small, nut-like tubers, of a sweetish taste, and they are eaten\r\nby children, either in the raw state or after being roasted. These\r\ntubers have various local names, and in addition to the above, they\r\nare called kipper nuts, and pig nuts in England, but a familiar\r\nlocal name in Scotland is lousy nuts, because it is said that eating\r\nthem is sure to breed lice. But this story may have been invented by\r\nparents to deter their children from digging and eating the roots of\r\nwild plants. Willdenow, in naming this species, certainly recognized\r\nits edible qualities, and that children were fond of it, else he\r\nwould not have called it an earth chestnut,--_bulbo_, bulb, and\r\n_castanum_ from _castanea_, the chestnut.\r\n\r\nELK NUT.--See Oil nut.\r\n\r\nFISTICKE NUT.--See Pistacia nut.\r\n\r\nFOX NUT.--The seeds of a floating, annual aquatic plant, the\r\n_Euryale ferox_, native of India, and belonging to the water lily\r\nfamily (_Nymphaeaceae_). It is a handsome plant, with leaves about two\r\nfeet in diameter, of a rich purple on the underside, with thorn-like\r\nspines on the veins. Flowers deep violet-red. The seeds of this\r\nspecies are eaten by the natives, the same as the aborigines of this\r\ncountry gathered the seeds of our indigenous _Nelumbium luteum_,\r\nunder the name of water chinquapin, using them for food in the late\r\nfall and winter.\r\n\r\nGINKGO NUT.--The large, round, white, somewhat flattened, nut-like\r\nseeds of the now common maidenhair tree, or _Ginkgo biloba_, also\r\nknown as _Salisburia adiantifolia_ of some nurserymen's catalogues\r\nand many recent botanical works. The former, however, is the older\r\nand correct scientific name. This tree is a native of China and\r\nJapan, and of a slender, sparsely branched habit, growing from fifty\r\nto eighty feet high in its native countries. It is a deciduous,\r\ncone-bearing (_Coniferae_) tree, with two-lobed, fan-shaped leaves\r\ntwo to three inches broad, divided about halfway down from the top.\r\nThe male and female flowers are on separate trees, and to secure\r\nseed or nuts both sexes must be grown near together. The ginkgo was\r\nintroduced into European gardens in 1754, and there are now many\r\nfruiting specimens, especially in France, from whence the nuts have\r\nlong been secured for planting, by nurserymen and others interested\r\nin tree culture. There are very few bearing trees in this country,\r\nand one in Washington, D. C., has been fruiting for a number of\r\nyears. In China and Japan the seeds or nuts are valued for their\r\nedible qualities, but they have a kind of disagreeable, balsamic\r\ntaste in their raw state, although this is dispelled by roasting,\r\nafter which they are quite sweet and palatable. As the trees do not\r\nbegin to bear until of considerable age, and the nuts are inferior\r\nto many other kinds, I do not think the ginkgo will ever become very\r\npopular in this country as a nut tree.\r\n\r\nGOORA NUT.--See Cola nut.\r\n\r\nGORGON NUT.--See Fox nut.\r\n\r\nGROUNDNUT.--The small, globular tubers of the dwarf three-leaved\r\nginseng, _Aralia trifolia_, are called groundnuts in some of our\r\nNorthern States, and they are frequently sought for, dug up and\r\neaten by children, as I know from personal experience. The plant\r\nbelongs to the ginseng family (_Araliaceae_), and is closely related\r\nto the true five-leaved ginseng (_Aralia quinquefolia_), but our\r\ngroundnut has only three leaves, instead of five; besides, it is a\r\nsomewhat smaller plant, rarely more than six to eight inches high.\r\nWhen the scattered seed sprout in spring, they send down a long,\r\nslender, thread-like rootstock, to a depth of from four to six\r\ninches, and at the bottom of this the small tuber is produced. It\r\nhas a somewhat pungent taste, but this only whets the appetite of a\r\nboy when on a hunt for ground nuts.\r\n\r\nGROUNDNUT.--The tubers of one of the most widely distributed\r\nclimbing plants of the Eastern States, and common in low, wet\r\ngrounds almost everywhere, from Canada to Florida, and westward to\r\nthe Mississippi. This plant is described in most of the botanical\r\nworks of the present day under the name of _Apios tuberosa_, and it\r\nbelongs to the Pulse family (_Leguminosae_), and is closely related\r\nto the common and well-known wistarias, although much smaller and of\r\na more slender habit. It is a smooth, perennial, twining vine, with\r\npinnate leaves, and dense racemes or clusters of small\r\nbrownish-purple pea-shaped flowers. The subterranean rootstocks bear\r\nlong strings of edible tubers, from one to two inches long, and from\r\nan inch to an inch and a half in diameter, somewhat variable in\r\nshape, dark brown on the outside, but white within. When boiled or\r\nroasted these tubers have a rich, farinaceous, nutty flavor. This\r\ntuber or groundnut is the one described by Mr. Thomas Herriot, the\r\nhistoriographer of Sir Walter Raleigh's expedition to Virginia in\r\n1585, under the Indian name of \"Openawk.\" He says: \"These roots are\r\nround, some as large as walnuts, others much larger; they grow in\r\ndamp soil, many hanging together, as fixed on ropes; they are good\r\nfood, either boiled or roasted.\" These tubers are to be found in the\r\nswamps and damp soils of Virginia at this day, just as they were at\r\nthe time of Herriot's visit, but many modern historians have tried\r\nto make out that Raleigh's colonists found our common potato among\r\nthe Indians at that time, although I have never been able to find a\r\nscrap of trustworthy history to support such a claim, or that\r\nRaleigh himself ever planted or cultivated the American potato in\r\nIreland or England, or, in fact, ever tasted one of these tubers.\r\n\r\nGROUNDNUT.--See Peanut or Goober.\r\n\r\nHAZELNUT, OR CHILE HAZEL.--This is merely a local English name for\r\nthe fruit of a small evergreen tree, native of Chile, S. A., where\r\nit is known as Guevina, and this has been adopted as the name of the\r\ngenus, adding the specific name of the European hazel, so we have\r\n_Guevina Avellana_, although in some botanical works it may be found\r\nunder the name of _Qudria heterophylla_. It belongs to the Protea\r\nfamily (_Proteaceae_). It has white, hermaphrodite flowers, in long\r\naxillary racemes; these are succeeded by coral-red fruit about the\r\nsize of a large cherry; the stone or nut-like seeds being edible are\r\nlargely used by the Chileans. They are said to taste like the hazel,\r\nhence the name. Trees are hardy in the southwest of England, and\r\nwould probably succeed here in the Southern States. It has been\r\nplanted and found to thrive in California. Readily propagated from\r\nseed or green cuttings under glass.\r\n\r\nHORSE-CHESTNUT.--The fruit of a genus of deciduous ornamental trees\r\nand shrubs, native of Asia and North America. The common\r\nhorse-chestnut, or _AEsculus Hippocastanum_, is a native of Asia, and\r\nwas introduced into Europe over three hundred years ago, its large,\r\nsmooth seeds and prickly husks probably suggesting both its common\r\nand scientific names, although these trees do not even belong to the\r\nsame order as the true edible chestnuts (_Castanea_), but to the\r\nsoapworts (_Sapindaceae_). It is supposed that the prefix, \"horse,\"\r\nwas derived from a custom among the Turks, of giving the nuts to\r\nhorses as a medicine when these animals were afflicted with a cough\r\nor inclined to become wind-broken. In southern Europe they are\r\nsometimes fed to cows to increase the flow of milk, and at one time\r\nthey were employed for making paste for book binders. They are\r\nscarcely edible, although containing considerable farinaceous\r\nmatter, owing to the presence of a bitter narcotic principle. Our\r\nnative species, better known as Buckeyes, with both smooth and\r\nprickly fruit, are equally worthless as food.\r\n\r\nIVORY NUT.--There are two species of palms producing nuts hard\r\nenough to be employed as a substitute for ivory, in the manufacture\r\nof small articles of domestic use. But the one best known to\r\ncommerce under the name of ivory nut is the fruit of _Phytelephas\r\nmacrocarpa_, native of New Granada and other parts of Central\r\nAmerica. This palm is a low-growing and almost decumbent species,\r\nthe stem seldom more than six to eight inches in diameter; but the\r\nleaves are of immense length, or from fifteen to twenty feet,\r\ngrowing in bundles, or clusters. The fruit consists of about forty\r\nnuts, enclosed in a rough, spiny husk, of a globular form, produced\r\non a short footstalk growing from the axis of the leaves, the whole\r\nbunch weighing from twenty to thirty pounds. They are two inches\r\nlong, slightly triangular, and covered with a thin, pulpy coat,\r\nwhich becomes dry, papery and brittle when thoroughly dried, but\r\nwhen in its green state it is sometimes utilized by the natives for\r\nmaking a favorite beverage. The ripe nuts are very solid, hard, and\r\nwhen polished resemble ivory. Immense quantities of these nuts are\r\nimported into this country, as well as Europe, and used as a\r\nsubstitute for bone and ivory for making buttons, toys, and similar\r\nsmall articles.\r\n\r\nJESUIT CHESTNUT.--See Water chestnut.\r\n\r\nJICARA NUT.--A local name, in some of the Central American States\r\nfor the Calabash (_Crescentia Cujete_). A low-growing, rather rough\r\ntree, with simple leaves, usually three growing together on a broad\r\nleafstalk. The fruit is extremely variable, both in size and form,\r\nbut mainly globose, and two to four inches in diameter. The shell is\r\nvery hard, and largely used for drinking cups, and these are\r\nsometimes highly ornamented on the outside. The kernel is scarcely\r\nedible, but is used by the natives as a medicine.\r\n\r\nJUBA NUT.--See Coquito nut.\r\n\r\nJUVIA NUT.--See Brazil nut.\r\n\r\nKIPPER NUT.--See Earth chestnut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103. LITCHI OR LEECHEE NUT.]\r\n\r\nLITCHI NUT OR LEECHEE NUT.--I am inclined to think that the affix of\r\n\"nut\" to this Oriental fruit is an Americanism, and not used\r\nelsewhere. There are three distinct species of this fruit known\r\namong the Chinese, under the name of Litchi, Longan or Long-yen, and\r\nRambutan, all the product of the Nepheliums, a genus of the\r\nsoapberry family (_Sapindaceae_). By some of the earlier botanical\r\nworks the litchi is placed either in the genus _Dimocarpus_ or\r\n_Euphoria_. Within the past few years this fruit has appeared in our\r\nmarkets, in consequence of the increased trade with Oriental\r\ncountries, and facilities for rapid transit across the continent.\r\nThe litchi is a globular fruit, about one inch in diameter (Fig.\r\n103), with a thin, chocolate-brown colored shell covered with\r\nwart-like protuberances. When fresh the shell is filled with a\r\nwhite, jelly-like pulp, in the center of which there is one rather\r\nlarge, smooth brown seed. The pulp is of a most delicious sub-acid\r\nflavor, but it is often rather dry and stale in the nuts which reach\r\nus from China and Japan. The tree producing this fruit is seldom\r\nmore than twenty-five feet high, with rather sturdy twigs and\r\nbranches, the leaves composed of about seven oblong pointed\r\nleaflets. This is said to be one of the most popular of Oriental\r\nfruits, and the trees would probably succeed in many of the Southern\r\nStates and in California. It is now on trial in Florida, having been\r\nintroduced there in 1886. It has been fruited in England many times,\r\nbut always under glass, where the plants receive protection and\r\nartificial heat. A full description of this species, accompanied by\r\na superb colored plate of the _Nephelium_ or _Dimocarpus Longana_,\r\nappeared in the \"Transactions of the London Horticultural Society,\"\r\n1818, p. 402. There are not only a large number of species of the\r\nNepheliums bearing edible fruit, but, as might be expected from\r\ntheir long and extensive cultivation, many local varieties,\r\nespecially in the southern provinces of China and throughout the\r\nislands of tropical Asia. The Dawa of the Fiji islands is the fruit\r\nof _N. pinnatum_, a tree growing sixty feet high, and forming\r\nextensive forests on those islands. At some future time we may be\r\nreceiving the dawas under the name of Fiji nuts.\r\n\r\nLOUSY NUT.--See Earth chestnut.\r\n\r\nMARKING NUT.--The seeds of _Semecarpus Anacardium_, an evergreen\r\ntree of the cashew-nut family (_Anacardiaceae_), native of tropical\r\nAsia, and especially Ceylon. It has large, oblong leaves, and grows\r\nabout fifty feet high, and the fruit is produced on a fleshy\r\nreceptacle. The natives roast and eat these nuts, and the black\r\njuice obtained from the green fruit is used for marking cloth, hence\r\nthe common name. The juice is also mixed with lime to make an\r\nexcellent indelible ink, also for a kind of varnish.\r\n\r\nMIRITI NUT OR ITA PALM NUT.--These are the Indian names of the fruit\r\nof a lofty palm tree, the _Mauritia flexuosa_, of the swamps along\r\nthe Orinoco river, also in wet soils at higher elevations. This\r\ngiant palm grows to a hight of a hundred and fifty feet, with an\r\nimmense crown of large, fan-shaped leaves, and just beneath these\r\nthe fruit appears in a pendulous cluster eight to ten feet long,\r\ncontaining several bushels, weighing, altogether, from one to three\r\nhundred pounds. The individual nuts are about the size of an\r\nordinary apple, with a very smooth shell, somewhat veined or\r\nstreaked. The natives of the country not only use the farinaceous\r\nkernels of these nuts as food, but obtain a saccharine material from\r\nthe pith, out of which they make wine by fermentation. The petioles\r\nof the leaves also furnish them with a strong fiber, used as\r\nthread-cord, and for various other purposes.\r\n\r\nMORETON BAY CHESTNUT.--See Australian chestnut.\r\n\r\nMONKEY-POT NUT.--See Sapucaia nut.\r\n\r\nMYROBALAN NUT.--This name is applied rather indiscriminately to the\r\nfruits of several species of the genus _Terminalia_, which are, in\r\nthe main, large trees of the Myrobalan family (_Combretaceae_). They\r\nare native of India, Malay, Fiji, and, in fact, almost all the\r\nislands of the Pacific in warm latitudes. The fruits are similar to\r\nlarge plums, but slightly angular, containing a hard, nut-like seed.\r\nThey are used principally for tanning leather, and also for making\r\nink similar to that made from oak galls. The kernels of all the\r\nspecies are edible, and are eaten by the natives. In the Fiji\r\nislands the _Terminalia Catappa_ is a favorite tree with the\r\nnatives, and they plant it near the houses. The kernels of this\r\nspecies have the flavor of the sweet almond.\r\n\r\nNICKAR NUT.--The seeds of two species of _Guilandina_, a genus of\r\nthe bean family (_Leguminosae_). They are climbing plants, with\r\nhard-wooded, prickly stems, forming almost impenetrable thickets\r\nnear the seacoast in the East Indies and other tropical countries.\r\nThey have become widely distributed, as the pods readily float when\r\nthey drop into the water. The pods are about three inches long, very\r\nprickly, containing seeds or nuts about the size of small marbles,\r\nand exceedingly hard; but in time the water softens them, after\r\nwhich they sprout and grow when cast upon the shore by the waves.\r\nThe two species are distinguished mainly by the color of the nuts,\r\nthose of _G. Bonduc_ being yellow, and those of _G. Bonducella_\r\ngray, or with a reddish tint. Of no value or use except as botanical\r\ncuriosities.\r\n\r\nNITTA OR NUTTA NUT.--The native African name of the seeds of _Parkia\r\nAfricana_, a tree of the sensitive-tree section of the bean family\r\n(_Leguminosae_). It grows about forty feet high, and has compound\r\nwinged leaves. It has become naturalized in the West Indies. The\r\npods grow in clusters, the seeds imbedded in a yellowish, sweet\r\npulp, like the carob or St. John's bread, and the negroes are very\r\nfond of them. In the Soudan the seeds are roasted, and then allowed\r\nto ferment in water until they are soft and putrid, after which they\r\nare washed, pounded and dried, then made up into cakes to be used as\r\na sauce for different kinds of food. It is supposed that the African\r\ntraveler, Mungo Park, first brought these seeds or nuts to the\r\nnotice of Europeans, and Robert Brown named the genus _Parkia_ in\r\nhis honor.\r\n\r\nNUTMEG.--A name applied to the fruits of a large number of trees,\r\nand of different orders of plants. The true nutmegs of commerce are\r\nthe fruits of trees belonging to the genus _Myristica_, and of the\r\nfamily _Myristicaceae_. The oldest and best known of these is the _M.\r\nfragrans_, a small, widely branching tree, growing twenty to\r\ntwenty-five feet high, and supposed to be indigenous to the Indian\r\nArchipelago. The fruit is about the size of an ordinary walnut, with\r\na thick rind, which, upon opening, at maturity, discloses a reddish\r\naril covering the nut within. This aril or husk is the mace of\r\ncommerce, while the true nutmeg is the center or hard seed (nut).\r\nThe Brazil nutmeg is longer than the true species, and is sold under\r\nthe name of long nutmeg, and is the fruit of _M. fatua_. Another\r\nspecies, the _M. otoba_, is cultivated in Madagascar, but is\r\nscarcely known in commerce.\r\n\r\nAnother species, the _M. sebifera_, is a common tree in the forests\r\nof Guiana, North Brazil, and up into Panama. It is utilized\r\nprincipally for the oil extracted from the nuts, obtained by\r\nmacerating them in water, the oil rising to the surface, and as it\r\ncools skimmed off.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of several species of conifers and laurels are known,\r\neither locally or in commerce, as nutmegs, or are used as a\r\nsubstitute for the true nutmeg. There are three different kinds of\r\ntrees, native of Guiana, in addition to the one already named, the\r\nseeds of which are employed as a spice or medicine. One of these is\r\nthe _Acrodiclidium camara_. These nuts are known in commerce as\r\n\"Ackawai nutmegs,\" and are used mainly as a cure for diarrhoea and\r\ncolic. Another is the seed of the _Aydendron Cujumary_ tree, and\r\nthey are known in commerce as \"Cujumary beans,\" although they are\r\nnot, strictly speaking, a bean, and the same is true of the\r\nso-called \"Puchurim beans,\" from the same country, for they are the\r\nfruit of _Nectandy Puchury_, a small tree of the laurel family. They\r\nare used as a tonic, and considered highly stimulating.\r\n\r\n_Clove Nutmeg_, or Madagascar nutmeg of commerce, is the fruit of\r\n_Agathophyllum aromaticum_, a small evergreen tree, indigenous to\r\nMadagascar.\r\n\r\n_Brazilian Nutmegs_ are the highly aromatic seeds of _Cryptocarya\r\nmoschata_, or _Atherosperma moschata_ of some botanists. It is a\r\nlofty tree, native of Brazil. The aromatic nuts are used as a\r\nsubstitute for nutmegs, but are very inferior to the genuine.\r\n\r\n_Peruvian Nutmeg, or Plum Nutmeg._--The seeds of a large evergreen\r\ntree with aromatic foliage, like our common sassafras, and for this\r\nreason is sometimes called Chilean or Peruvian sassafras. The seeds\r\nare of no more economic value than those of our native sassafras. It\r\nis known under various botanical names, but _Laurelia sempervirens_\r\nis, perhaps, the most familiar.\r\n\r\n_California Nutmeg_, or _Stinking Nutmeg_, is the nut-like seed of\r\n_Torreya Californica_, a small tree of the yew family (_Taxaceae_).\r\nThe fruit is from an inch to an inch and a half long, with a fleshy\r\nrind enclosing a hard, long nut, which is slightly grooved like a\r\nnutmeg. The fruit, leaves and wood are strongly scented, hence the\r\nname of \"stinking nutmeg,\" or \"stinking yew.\" Another species, the\r\n_T. taxifolia_, is a native of Florida.\r\n\r\nOIL NUT.--The fruit of a low-branching, deciduous native shrub,\r\ngrowing three to ten feet high, with alternate leaves and small\r\ngreenish flowers in terminal spikes. It is the _Pyrularia oleifera_\r\nof Gray, and _Hamiltonia oleifera_ of Muhlenberg. The fruit is in\r\nthe form of a pear-shaped drupe, about an inch long, the small seed\r\nor nut with an oily kernel of strong acrid taste; of no value. This\r\nshrub is found on shady banks in the mountains of Pennsylvania, and\r\nsouthward into Georgia.\r\n\r\nPARADISE NUT.--See Sapucaia nut.\r\n\r\nPEANUT, GROUNDNUT, GOOBER.--The well-known fruit of _Arachis\r\nhypogaea_, a low-growing annual belonging to the pulse or pea family\r\n(_Leguminosae_), supposed to be a native of South America, but now\r\nextensively cultivated in nearly all semi-tropical countries and\r\nwherever the summers are long enough to insure the ripening of the\r\nseeds. Extensively cultivated in Virginia, south and westward. Too\r\nwell known to require any further comment or notice here.\r\n\r\nPECAN NUT.--See Chap. VII.\r\n\r\nPEKEA NUT.--See Souari nut.\r\n\r\nPERUVIAN NUT.--See Nutmegs.\r\n\r\nPHYSIC NUT.--The seeds of _Jatropha Curcas_, a small tree of the\r\nspurgewort family (_Euphorbiaceae_). It is native of some of the West\r\nIndies and warmer parts of South America, but now cultivated in\r\nother tropical countries for its seeds, which yield an oil used for\r\nthe same purposes as castor oil, but rather more powerful and\r\ndrastic. The seeds have a nutty flavor, but are rather dangerous if\r\neaten in any considerable quantities, and death has been known to\r\nfollow excess in this direction.\r\n\r\nPHYSIC NUT.--In \"Bartram's Travels,\" he refers to a seed or nut of a\r\nplant he found growing in Florida under this name, p. 41, as\r\nfollows: \" ... some very curious new shrubs and plants, particularly\r\nthe physic nut or Indian olive. The stems arise, many from a root,\r\ntwo or three feet high; the leaves sit opposite, on very short\r\npetioles; they are broad, lanceolate, entire and undulated, having a\r\nsmooth surface, of a deep green color. From the bosom of each leaf\r\nis produced a single oval drupe, standing erect on long slender\r\nstems; it has a large kernel and thin pulp. The fruit is yellow when\r\nripe, and about the size of an olive. The Indians, when they go in\r\npursuit of deer, carry this fruit with them, supposing that it has\r\nthe power of charming or drawing that creature to them, from whence,\r\nwith traders, it has obtained the name of physic nut, which means,\r\nwith them, charming, conjuring or fascinating.\"\r\n\r\nTo what kind of fruit Bartram referred under the name of \"physic\r\nnut,\" is not certain, but his description of the plant comes very\r\nnear that of the American olive (_Olea Americana_), but the fruit of\r\nthis and other closely allied plants of the same family are not\r\n\"yellow\" when ripe, but purple.\r\n\r\nPIGNUT, OR HOGNUT.--See chapter on Hickory.\r\n\r\nPINE NUT.--A name applied indiscriminately to the many species of\r\npine trees (_Pinus_) bearing seeds large enough to be conveniently\r\nused as food. In southern Europe, and especially in Italy and the\r\nsouth of France, the seeds of the stone pine (_Pinus Pinea_) have\r\nbeen extensively used as food, from the earliest times down to the\r\npresent day. Nearly all the ancient authors refer to them as among\r\nthe valuable products of the country. Macrobius, in his story of the\r\n_Saturnalia_, speaks of the cones as _Nuces vel Poma Pinea_. These\r\npine nuts are called _Pinocchi_ in Italy and Sicily, and\r\noccasionally a few reach this country, where the Italian name has\r\nbeen corrupted into Pinolas. These seeds or nuts are used for\r\ndesserts, puddings and cakes, also eaten raw at table, as with\r\nalmonds. They have a slight taste of turpentine, but it is not\r\nstrong enough to be at all disagreeable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104. BRANCH OF NUT PINE.]\r\n\r\nIn this country we have several native species bearing very large\r\nedible seeds, and they are known in the West under the general name\r\nof _Pinon_, or nut pines. The best of these nuts, to my taste, are\r\nthe seeds of _Pinus edulis_, so named by the late Dr. Engelmann,\r\nbecause of its large, sweet and edible seeds. It is a small,\r\nlow-growing tree, more or less common on dry hills and slopes, from\r\nColorado southward through New Mexico, and into western Texas. The\r\nseeds of _Pinus Parryana_ and _Pinus cembroides_, of Arizona and\r\nLower California, are also called Pinons, and largely gathered by\r\nthe Indians. Farther east and north, we find the one-leaved pine\r\n(_Pinus monophylla_), and although the seeds are much smaller than\r\nthose of _P. edulis_, they were formerly gathered in immense\r\nquantities by the Indians, to help eke out their often scanty winter\r\nstore of food. Occasionally a small quantity of these pine nuts is\r\nsent to Eastern markets, but rarely, unless ordered early in the\r\nseason. The trees of _P. edulis_ and _P. monophylla_ are perfectly\r\nhardy here, and worth cultivating for ornament, as well as their\r\nnuts, although their slow growth is a rather severe test of one's\r\npatience. Fig. 104 shows a Pinon branch.\r\n\r\nPISTACHIO NUT.--Historically, this is a very ancient nut, for Bible\r\ncommentators claim that it is the one sent by Jacob into Egypt. It\r\nis the fruit of a small, deciduous tree of the cashew family\r\n(_Anacardiaceae_), a native of western Asia, but many centuries ago\r\nit had become naturalized in Palestine and throughout the\r\nMediterranean regions. It has shining evergreen winged leaves, and\r\nthe bark on the young twigs is brown, becoming russet-colored with\r\nage. There are several different species, but the one producing the\r\nnuts of commerce is the _Pistacia vera_, having brownish-green\r\nflowers in loose panicles, and these are succeeded by bunches of\r\nreddish fruit, about an inch long, with an oblique or bent point.\r\nThe nuts have a double shell, the outer one usually red, the inner\r\none smooth and brittle; the kernel is pale green, sweet, and of\r\nrather pleasant taste. There are a number of varieties, differing\r\nonly slightly in form and size. This nut has been cultivated\r\nsparingly in Great Britain since 1570, but the climate is not quite\r\nwarm enough to insure its ripening in the open air. It would\r\nprobably succeed throughout the greater part of California, as well\r\nas in the extreme Southern States, but Mr. Berckmans writes me that\r\nit is not hardy in his grounds at Augusta, Ga. There is a species of\r\npistacia known as _P. Mexicana_, found in central Mexico, and\r\nextending as far north as San Diego, in California, according to the\r\nreport of Dr. Cooper (Botany of California, Vol. I, p. 109).\r\n\r\nQUANDANG NUT.--A medium size Australian tree, the _Santalum\r\nacuminatum_, of the sandalwood family (_Santalaceae_). It produces a\r\nplum-like fruit, which is best known in its native country as the\r\nquandang nut. It is used as a preserve, but is little known, except\r\nin or near its native habitats.\r\n\r\nQUEENSLAND NUT.--See Australian hazelnut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105. PARADISE OR SAPUCAIA NUT.]\r\n\r\nSAPUCAIA NUT.--The Brazilian name of, at least, two species of large\r\nforest trees growing in the valley of the Amazon and its\r\ntributaries. The best known of these is the _Lecythis Zabucajo_, a\r\nlofty tree of the myrtle family (_Myrtaceae_). It is closely allied\r\nto the more common Brazil nut of commerce. The sapucaia nuts are\r\nproduced in an urn-shaped, woody capsule, which has received the\r\nname of Monkey-pot, because when these capsules ripen the lid at the\r\ntop is suddenly liberated, emitting a sharp sound, which, as heard\r\nby the monkeys, gives them notice that the nuts are falling, and\r\nthat the first on the ground becomes the fortunate possessor of the\r\nlargest number. The capsules or pots are about six inches in\r\ndiameter, and the lid opening at the top about two inches. The nuts,\r\nwhich are packed very closely in the shell, are about one inch in\r\ndiameter, and two to three in length, with a thin, brown, and very\r\nmuch wrinkled and twisted shell (Fig. 105). The kernel is white,\r\nsweet, oily, and somewhat more delicate in flavor than that of the\r\ncommon Brazil nut. In New York city these nuts are sold under the\r\nname of Paradise nuts. But this is probably only a local name, for I\r\nhave been unable to find it in any botanical work. These nuts rarely\r\ncome to this country in any considerable quantities; a few hundred\r\npounds at a time would be considered a large consignment.\r\n\r\nSASSAFRAS NUT.--See Nutmeg, Chilean.\r\n\r\nSASSAFRAS NUT.--See Nutmeg, Puchury.\r\n\r\nSNAKE NUT.--A large, roundish fruit, about the size of the black\r\nwalnut, the product of the _Ophiocaryon paradoxum_, a large tree of\r\nthe soapberry family (_Sapindaceae_), native of British Guiana. This\r\nnut takes its name of \"Snake nut,\" from the peculiar form of the\r\nembryo of the seed, which is curled up spirally. The Indians,\r\nthinking there must be some virtue in form, use these nuts as an\r\nantidote for snake bites, although, so far as known to science, they\r\ndo not possess any medicinal properties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106. SOUARI NUT.]\r\n\r\nSOUARI NUT, OR BUTTERNUT.--This nut, like the last, is a native of\r\nBritish Guiana, and is the fruit of the _Caryocar nuciferum_, a\r\nnoble tree, growing a hundred feet high, having large, broad,\r\ntrifoliate leaves, resembling those of our common horse-chestnut,\r\nbut not quite as broad. The flowers are very large, and, with the\r\ntube, fully a foot long, of a deep purple on the outside, and yellow\r\nwithin. They are composed of five thick, fleshy petals, and as showy\r\nas some of our best and brightest-colored magnolias. The flowers are\r\nproduced in terminal clusters or corymbs, succeeded by a large,\r\nround, four-celled fleshy fruit five to six inches in diameter; but\r\nas some of the embryo nuts usually fail to grow, it changes the form\r\nof the fruit as it enlarges towards maturity, and only one or two of\r\nthe nuts mature and ripen, very much as frequently occurs in both\r\nthe sweet and horse-chestnuts. The nuts are affixed to a central\r\naxis, and are of a rounded, subreniform shape, and even flattened to\r\nan almost sharp edge on one side, and broadly truncate at the scar\r\n(hilum) where they are attached to the pericarp or central axis. The\r\nshell is of a deep brown color, embossed, as it were, with smooth\r\ntubercles. They are from two to two and a half inches or more in\r\ntheir broadest diameter, as shown in Fig. 106. The kernel or meat is\r\npure white, soft, rich and oily, with a pleasant flavor. This nut is\r\na rarity in our markets, and Mr. H. R. Davy of New York, to whom I\r\nam indebted for a specimen, as well as other rare kinds, assures me\r\nthat in his forty-five years' experience as a dealer in foreign\r\nfruits and nuts, he has never known of but one lot, and that one\r\nconsisted of about one-half bushel, brought into his store by a\r\nsailor, who only knew their common South American name. These nuts\r\nare more frequently seen in European seaports than in those of this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSOUTH SEA CHESTNUT.--See Tahitian chestnut.\r\n\r\nTAHITIAN CHESTNUT.--The seeds of a tree known in the South Sea\r\nislands by the native name of Toi, but to botanists as _Inocarpus\r\nedulis_. It belongs to the bean family (_Leguminosae_). The tree\r\ngrows sixty to eighty feet high, and when young the stems are fluted\r\nlike a Grecian column, but as they increase with age the projections\r\nextend outward, until they form a kind of buttress all around the\r\nlower part, gradually decreasing upward. This so-called chestnut\r\ntree has yellow flowers, succeeded by fibrous pods containing one\r\nlarge seed or nut, which, when roasted or boiled, resembles the\r\nchestnut in taste. The nuts have a different local name in almost\r\nevery one of the Pacific islands where it is at all abundant.\r\n\r\nTAVOLA NUT.--See Myrobalan nut.\r\n\r\nTALLOW NUT.--A local and nearly obsolete name for the fruit of the\r\nOgeechee lime or sour gum tree (_Nyssa capitata_) of the swamps of\r\nFlorida, Georgia and westward. The fruit is about an inch long,\r\nresembling a small plum, the pulp having an agreeable acid taste.\r\nBartram, p. 94, refers to this fruit under the name of \"Tallow nut,\"\r\nbut why so called is not explained.\r\n\r\nTALLOW NUT.--The fruit of the Chinese Tallow tree, _Stillingia\r\nsebifera_, of the spurgewort family (_Euphorbiaceae_), a native of\r\nChina, where it is, as well as in some of the warmer parts of\r\nAmerica, extensively cultivated. It has been planted in a few\r\nlocalities in the Southern States, and appears to thrive. It is a\r\nsmall tree thirty to forty feet high, with rhomboid tapering leaves\r\nand a three-celled capsuled fruit, each cell containing only a\r\nsingle seed thickly coated with a yellow, tallow-like substance,\r\nhence its common name. This tallow or grease is used for making\r\nsoap, burning in lamps, and also for dressing cloth.\r\n\r\nTEMPERANCE NUT.--An English name of cola nut.\r\n\r\nTORREY NUT.--The hard, nut-like seeds of _Torreya nucifera_, of\r\nSiebold, or _Taxus nucifera_, of Kaempfer, and _Caryotaxus nucifera_,\r\nof Zuccarini, a tree native of Japan, where these nuts are eaten by\r\nthe Japanese, either raw or roasted. An oil is also extracted from\r\nthe nuts, for use in cooking or for burning in lamps. This Japanese\r\ntree belongs to the same genus as the so-called California nutmeg\r\n(see Nutmeg) and our Florida stinking cedar (_T. taxifolia_), also\r\nthe great Chinese cedar (_T. grandis_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107. WATER CHESTNUT.]\r\n\r\nWATER CHESTNUT.--Also known as water caltrops. The seeds of several\r\nspecies of water plants of the genus _Trapa_, of the evening\r\nprimrose family (_Onagraceae_). In southern Europe and eastward there\r\nis a species found in ponds, the seeds of which are called Jesuit\r\nchestnuts (_T. natans_), and in India and Ceylon a closely allied\r\none, the Singhara-nut plant (_T. bispinosa_), while in Lago Maggiore\r\nthere is another (_T. verbanensis_), but all may be varieties of one\r\nand the same species, including the _Trapa bicornis_, a two-horned\r\nwater chestnut, extensively used in China and Japan as food under\r\nvarious local names. In China they are called Ling, and of late\r\nyears have been occasionally imported and sold, more as curiosities\r\nthan for eating. These seeds or nuts are of a dark brown color, and\r\nof the form and size shown in Fig. 107, resembling, in miniature,\r\nthe skull of an ox with abbreviated horns. When fresh, the kernel is\r\nof an agreeable nutty flavor.\r\n\r\nWATER CHESTNUT, OR CHINQUAPIN.--The seeds of the large yellow water\r\nlily (_Nelumbium luteum_), a very common plant in small ponds in the\r\nWest and South, but more rare in the East. The seeds are about the\r\nsize and shape of small acorns, and produced in a large, top-shaped,\r\nfleshy receptacle. They are edible, and are supposed to have been\r\nextensively used as food by the aborigines of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAckawai nutmeg, 274\r\n\r\nAcorn,
