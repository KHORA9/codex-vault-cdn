Now, however, their father has died, and the only relative\r\nthey have is an uncle who works for the Hudson's Bay Company, in the\r\nvery north of Canada.  The uncle sends for them, and sends his own son\r\nto guide them over the Canadian part of the journey.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of their journey from their original home in the south\r\nof the U.S.A., many thousands of miles, to be with their uncle.  At the\r\ntime the only way they could do this journey was by their own efforts,\r\nby canoe, on foot, and, after the onset of winter, by sledge, or, if\r\nthey could get one, by dog-train.\r\n\r\nThe canoe and much of their clothes, food and equipment is lost in a\r\nmajor rapid, so they are very much thrown on their own ingenuity and\r\nwoodcraft.  One of the boys has a major interest in natural history, and\r\nwe hear from him all about the various animals and birds encountered.\r\nThis is far from being a bore, as the author has taken care to make it\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nThis is a very enjoyable book, even though it is over 150 years since it\r\nwas written.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG VOYAGEURS--BOY HUNTERS IN THE NORTH, BY CAPTAIN MAYNE REID.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE FUR COUNTRIES.\r\n\r\nBoy reader, you have heard of the Hudson's Bay Company?  Ten to one, you\r\nhave worn a piece of fur, which it has provided for you; if not, your\r\npretty little sister has--in her muff, or her boa, or as a trimming for\r\nher winter dress.  Would you like to know something of the country\r\nwhence come these furs?--of the animals whose backs have been stripped\r\nto obtain them?  As I feel certain that you and I are old friends, I\r\nmake bold to answer for you--yes.  Come, then! let us journey together\r\nto the \"Fur Countries;\" let us cross them from south to north.\r\n\r\nA vast journey it will be.  It will cost us many thousand miles of\r\ntravel.  We shall find neither railway-train, nor steamboat, nor\r\nstage-coach, to carry us on our way.  We shall not even have the help of\r\na horse.  For us no hotel shall spread its luxurious board; no road-side\r\ninn shall hang out its inviting sign and \"clean beds;\" no roof of any\r\nkind shall offer us its hospitable shelter.  Our table shall be a rock,\r\na log, or the earth itself; our lodging a tent; and our bed the skin of\r\na wild beast.  Such are the best accommodations we can expect upon our\r\njourney.  Are you still ready to undertake it?  Does the prospect not\r\ndeter you?\r\n\r\nNo--I hear you exclaim.  I shall be satisfied with the table--what care\r\nI for mahogany?  With the lodging--I can tent like an Arab.  With the\r\nbed--fling feathers to the wind!\r\n\r\nEnough, brave boy! you shall go with me to the wild regions of the\r\n\"North-west,\" to the far \"fur countries\" of America.  But, first--a word\r\nabout the land through which we are going to travel.\r\n\r\nTake down your Atlas.  Bend your eye upon the map of North America.\r\nNote two large islands--one upon the right side, Newfoundland; another\r\nupon the left, Vancouver.  Draw a line from one to the other; it will\r\nnearly bisect the continent.  North of that line you behold a vast\r\nterritory.  How vast!  You may take your scissors, and clip fifty\r\nEnglands out of it!  There are lakes there in which you might _drown_\r\nEngland, or make an island of it!  Now, you may form some idea of the\r\nvastness of that region known as the \"fur countries.\"\r\n\r\nWill you believe me, when I tell you that all this immense tract is a\r\nwilderness--a howling wilderness, if you like a poetical name?  It is\r\neven so.  From north to south, from ocean to ocean,--throughout all that\r\nvast domain, there is neither town nor village--hardly anything that can\r\nbe dignified with the name of \"settlement.\"  The only signs of\r\ncivilisation to be seen are the \"forts,\" or trading posts, of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company; and these \"signs\" are few and far--hundreds of\r\nmiles--between.  For inhabitants, the country has less than ten thousand\r\nwhite men, the _employes_ of the Company; and its native people are\r\nIndians of many tribes, living far apart, few in numbers, subsisting by\r\nthe chase, and half starving for at least a third part of every year!\r\nIn truth, the territory can hardly be called \"inhabited.\"  There is not\r\na man to every ten miles; and in many parts of it you may travel\r\nhundreds of miles without seeing a face, red, white, or black!\r\n\r\nThe physical aspect is, therefore, entirely wild.  It is very different\r\nin different parts of the territory.  One tract is peculiar.  It has\r\nbeen long known as the \"Barren Grounds.\"  It is a tract of vast extent.\r\nIt lies north-west from the shores of Hudson's Bay, extending nearly to\r\nthe Mackenzie River.  Its rocks are _primitive_.  It is a land of hills\r\nand valleys,--of deep dark lakes and sharp-running streams.  It is a\r\nwoodless region.  No timber is found there that deserves the name.  No\r\ntrees but glandular dwarf birches, willows, and black spruce, small and\r\nstunted.  Even these only grow in isolated valleys.  More generally the\r\nsurface is covered with coarse sand--the _debris_ of granite or\r\nquartz-rock--upon which no vegetable, save the lichen or the moss, can\r\nfind life and nourishment.  In one respect these \"Barren Grounds\" are\r\nunlike the deserts of Africa: they are well watered.  In almost every\r\nvalley there is a lake; and though many of these are landlocked, yet do\r\nthey contain fish of several species.  Sometimes these lakes communicate\r\nwith each other by means of rapid and turbulent streams passing through\r\nnarrow gorges; and lines of those connected lakes form the great rivers\r\nof the district.\r\n\r\nSuch is a large portion of the Hudson's Bay territory.  Most of the\r\nextensive peninsula of Labrador partakes of a similar character; and\r\nthere are other like tracts west of the Rocky Mountain range in the\r\n\"Russian possessions.\"\r\n\r\nYet these \"Barren Grounds\" have their denizens.  Nature has formed\r\nanimals that delight to dwell there, and that are never found in more\r\nfertile regions.  Two ruminating creatures find sustenance upon the\r\nmosses and lichens that cover their cold rocks: they are the caribou\r\n(reindeer) and the musk-ox.  These, in their turn, become the food and\r\nsubsistence of preying creatures.  The wolf, in all its varieties of\r\ngrey, black, white, pied, and dusky, follows upon their trail.  The\r\n\"brown bear,\"--a large species, nearly resembling the \"grizzly,\"--is\r\nfound only in the Barren Grounds; and the great \"Polar bear\" comes\r\nwithin their borders, but the latter is a dweller upon their shores\r\nalone, and finds his food among the finny tribes of the seas that\r\nsurround them.  In marshy ponds, existing here and there, the musk-rat\r\n(_Fibre zibethieus_) builds his house, like that of his larger cousin,\r\nthe beaver.  Upon the water sedge he finds subsistence; but his natural\r\nenemy, the wolverene (_Gulo luscus_), skulks in the same neighbourhood.\r\nThe \"Polar hare\" lives upon the leaves and twigs of the dwarf\r\nbirch-tree; and this, transformed into its own white flesh, becomes the\r\nfood of the Arctic fox.  The herbage, sparse though it be, does not grow\r\nin vain.  The seeds fall to the earth, but they are not suffered to\r\ndecay.  They are gathered by the little lemmings and meadow-mice\r\n(_arvicolae_), who, in their turn, become the prey of two species of\r\n_mustelidae_, the ermine and vison weasels.  Have the fish of the lakes\r\nno enemy?  Yes--a terrible one in the Canada otter.  The mink-weasel,\r\ntoo, pursues them; and in summer, the osprey, the great pelican, the\r\ncormorant, and the white-headed eagle.\r\n\r\nThese are the _fauna_ of the Barren Grounds.  Man rarely ventures within\r\ntheir boundaries.  The wretched creatures who find a living there are\r\nthe Esquimaux on their coasts, and a few Chippewa Indians in the\r\ninterior, who hunt the caribou, and are known as \"caribou-eaters.\"\r\nOther Indians enter them only in summer, in search of game, or\r\njourneying from point to point; and so perilous are these journeyings,\r\nthat numbers frequently perish by the way.  There are no white men in\r\nthe Barren Grounds.  The \"Company\" has no commerce there.  No fort is\r\nestablished in them: so scarce are the fur-bearing animals of these\r\nparts, their skins would not repay the expense of a \"trading post.\"\r\n\r\nFar different are the \"wooded tracts\" of the fur countries.  These lie\r\nmostly in the southern and central regions of the Hudson's Bay\r\nterritory.  There are found the valuable beaver, and the wolverene that\r\npreys upon it.  There dwells the American hare, with its enemy the\r\nCanada lynx.  There are the squirrels, and the beautiful martens\r\n(sables) that hunt them from tree to tree.  There are found the foxes of\r\nevery variety, the red, the cross, and the rare and highly-prized\r\nsilver-fox (_Vulpes argentatus_), whose shining skin sells for its\r\nweight in gold!  There, too, the black bear (_Ursus Americanus_) yields\r\nits fine coat to adorn the winter carriage, the holsters of the dragoon,\r\nand the shako of the grenadier.  There the fur-bearing animals exist in\r\ngreatest plenty, and many others whose skins are valuable in commerce,\r\nas the moose, the wapiti, and the wood-bison.\r\n\r\nBut there is also a \"prairie\" district in the fur countries.  The great\r\ntable prairies of North America, that slope eastward from the Rocky\r\nMountains, also extend northward into the Hudson's Bay territory.  They\r\ngradually grow narrower, however, as you proceed farther north, until,\r\non reaching the latitude of the Great Slave Lake, they end altogether.\r\nThis \"prairie land\" has its peculiar animals.  Upon it roams the\r\nbuffalo, the prong-horned antelope, and the mule-deer.  There, too, may\r\nbe seen the \"barking-wolf\" and the \"swift fox.\"  It is the favourite\r\nhome of the marmots, and the gauffres or sand-rats; and there, too, the\r\nnoblest of animals, the horse, runs wild.  West of this prairie tract is\r\na region of far different aspect,--the region of the Rocky Mountains.\r\nThis stupendous chain, sometimes called the Andes of North America,\r\ncontinues throughout the fur countries from their southern limits to the\r\nshores of the Arctic Sea.  Some of its peaks overlook the waters of that\r\nsea itself, towering up near the coast.  Many of these, even in southern\r\nlatitudes, carry the \"eternal snow.\"  This \"mountain-chain\" is, in\r\nplaces, of great breadth.  Deep valleys lie in its embrace, many of\r\nwhich have never been visited by man.  Some are desolate and dreary;\r\nothers are oases of vegetation, which fascinate the traveller whose\r\nfortune it has been, after toiling among naked rocks, to gaze upon their\r\nsmiling fertility.  These lovely wilds are the favourite home of many\r\nstrange animals.  The argali, or mountain-sheep, with his huge curving\r\nhorns, is seen there; and the shaggy wild goat bounds along the steepest\r\ncliffs.  The black bear wanders through the wooded ravines; and his\r\nfiercer congener, the \"grizzly\"--the most dreaded of all American\r\nanimals--drags his huge body along the rocky declivities.\r\n\r\nHaving crossed the mountains, the fur countries extend westward to the\r\nPacific.  There you encounter barren plains, treeless and waterless;\r\nrapid rivers, that foam through deep, rock-bound channels; and a country\r\naltogether rougher in aspect, and more mountainous, than that lying to\r\nthe east of the great chain.  A warmer atmosphere prevails as you\r\napproach the Pacific, and in some places forests of tall trees cover the\r\nearth.  In these are found most of the fur-bearing animals; and, on\r\naccount of the greater warmth of the climate, the true _felidae_--the\r\nlong-tailed cats--here wander much farther north than upon the eastern\r\nside of the continent.  Even so far north as the forests of Oregon these\r\nappear in the forms of the cougar (_Felis concolor_), and the ounce\r\n(_Felis onza_).\r\n\r\nBut it is not our intention at present to cross the Rocky Mountains.\r\nOur journey will lie altogether on the eastern side of that great chain.\r\nIt will extend from the frontiers of civilisation to the shores of the\r\nArctic Sea.  It is a long and perilous journey, boy reader; but as we\r\nhave made up our minds to it, let us waste no more time in talking, but\r\nset forth at once.  You are ready?  Hurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG VOYAGEURS.\r\n\r\nThere is a canoe upon the waters of Red River--Red River of the north.\r\nIt is near the source of the stream, but passing downward.  It is a\r\nsmall canoe, a frail structure of birch-bark, and contains only four\r\npersons.  They are all young--the eldest of them evidently not over\r\nnineteen years of age, and the youngest about fifteen.\r\n\r\nThe eldest is nearly full-grown, though his body and limbs have not yet\r\nassumed the muscular development of manhood.  His complexion is dark,\r\nnearly olive.  His hair is jet-black, straight as an Indian's, and long.\r\nHis eyes are large and brilliant, and his features prominent.  His\r\ncountenance expresses courage, and his well-set jaws betoken firmness\r\nand resolution.  He does not belie his looks, for he possesses these\r\nqualifications in a high degree.  There is a gravity in his manner,\r\nsomewhat rare in one so young; yet it is not the result of a morose\r\ndisposition, but a subdued temperament produced by modesty, good sense,\r\nand much experience.  Neither has it the air of stupidity.  No: you\r\ncould easily tell that the mind of this youth, if once roused, would\r\nexhibit both energy and alertness.  His quiet manner has a far different\r\nexpression.  It is an air of coolness and confidence, which tells you he\r\nhas met with dangers in the past, and would not fear to encounter them\r\nagain.  It is an expression peculiar, I think, to the hunters of the\r\n\"Far West,\"--those men who dwell amidst dangers in the wild regions of\r\nthe great prairies.  Their solitary mode of life begets this expression.\r\nThey are often for months without the company of a creature with whom\r\nthey may converse--months without beholding a human face.  They live\r\nalone with Nature, surrounded by her majestic forms.  These awe them\r\ninto habits of silence.  Such was in point of fact the case with the\r\nyouth whom we have been describing.  He had hunted much, though not as a\r\nprofessional hunter.  With him the chase had been followed merely as a\r\npastime; but its pursuit had brought him into situations of peril, and\r\nin contact with Nature in her wild solitudes.  Young as he was, he had\r\njourneyed over the grand prairies, and through the pathless forests of\r\nthe West.  He had slain the bear and the buffalo, the wild-cat and the\r\ncougar.  These experiences had made their impression upon his mind, and\r\nstamped his countenance with that air of gravity we have noticed.\r\n\r\nThe second of the youths whom we shall describe is very different in\r\nappearance.  He is of blonde complexion, rather pale, with fair silken\r\nhair that waves gently down his cheeks, and falls upon his shoulders.\r\nHe is far from robust.  On the contrary, his form is thin and delicate.\r\nIt is not the delicacy of feebleness or ill-health, but only a body of\r\nslighter build.  The manner in which he handles his oar shows that he\r\npossesses both health and strength, though neither in such a high degree\r\nas the dark youth.  His face expresses, perhaps, a larger amount of\r\nintellect, and it is a countenance that would strike you as more open\r\nand communicative.  The eye is blue and mild, and the brow is marked by\r\nthe paleness of study and habits of continued thought.  These\r\nindications are no more than just, for the fair-haired youth _is_ a\r\nstudent, and one of no ordinary attainments.  Although only seventeen\r\nyears of age, he is already well versed in the natural sciences; and\r\nmany a graduate of Oxford or Cambridge would but ill compare with him.\r\nThe former might excel in the knowledge--if we can dignify it by that\r\nname--of the laws of scansion, or in the composition of Greek idyls; but\r\nin all that constitutes _real_ knowledge he would prove but an idle\r\ntheorist, a dreamy imbecile, alongside our practical young scholar of\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\nThe third and youngest of the party--taking them as they sit from stem\r\nto bow--differs in many respects from both those described.  He has\r\nneither the gravity of the first, nor yet the intellectuality of the\r\nsecond.  His face is round, and full, and ruddy.  It is bright and\r\nsmiling in its expression.  His eye dances merrily in his head, and its\r\nglance falls upon everything.  His lips are hardly ever at rest.  They\r\nare either engaged in making words--for he talks almost incessantly--or\r\nelse contracting and expanding with smiles and joyous laughter.  His cap\r\nis jauntily set, and his fine brown curls, hanging against the rich\r\nroseate skin of his cheeks, give to his countenance an expression of\r\nextreme health and boyish beauty.  His merry laugh and free air tell you\r\nhe is not the boy for books.  He is not much of a hunter neither.  In\r\nfact, he is not particularly given to anything--one of those easy\r\nnatures who take the world as it comes, look upon the bright side of\r\neverything, without getting sufficiently interested to excel in\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nThese three youths were dressed nearly alike.  The eldest wore the\r\ncostume, as near as may be, of a backwoods hunter--a tunic-like\r\nhunting-shirt, of dressed buckskin, leggings and mocassins of the same\r\nmaterial, and all--shirt, leggings, and mocassins--handsomely braided\r\nand embroidered with stained quills of the porcupine.  The cape of the\r\nshirt was tastefully fringed, and so was the skirt as well as the seams\r\nof the mocassins.  On his head was a hairy cap of raccoon skin, and the\r\ntail of the animal, with its dark transverse bars, hung down behind like\r\nthe drooping plume of a helmet.  Around his shoulders were two leathern\r\nbelts that crossed each other upon his breast.  One of these slung a\r\nbullet-pouch covered with a violet-green skin that glittered splendidly\r\nin the sun.  It was from the head of the \"wood-duck\" (_Anas sponsa_),\r\nthe most beautiful bird of its tribe.  By the other strap was suspended\r\na large crescent-shaped horn taken from the head of an Opelousas bull,\r\nand carved with various ornamental devices.  Other smaller implements\r\nhung from the belts, attached by leathern thongs: there was a picker, a\r\nwiper, and a steel for striking fire with.  A third belt--a broad stout\r\none of alligator leather--encircled the youth's waist.  To this was\r\nfastened a holster, and the shining butt of a pistol could be seen\r\nprotruding out; a hunting-knife of the kind denominated \"bowie\" hanging\r\nover the left hip, completed his \"arms and accoutrements.\"\r\n\r\nThe second of the youths was dressed, as already stated, in a somewhat\r\nsimilar manner, though his accoutrements were not of so warlike a\r\ncharacter.  Like the other, he had a powder-horn and pouch, but instead\r\nof knife and pistol, a canvass bag or haversack hung from his shoulder;\r\nand had you looked into it, you would have seen that it was half filled\r\nwith shells, pieces of rock, and rare plants, gathered during the day--\r\nthe diurnal storehouse of the geologist, the palaeontologist, and\r\nbotanist--to be emptied for study and examination by the night\r\ncamp-fire.  Instead of the 'coon-skin cap he wore a white felt hat with\r\nbroad leaf; and for leggings and mocassins he had trousers of blue\r\ncottonade and laced buskins of tanned leather.\r\n\r\nThe youngest of the three was dressed and accoutred much like the\r\neldest, except that his cap was of blue cloth--somewhat after the\r\nfashion of the military forage cap.  All three wore shirts of coloured\r\ncotton, the best for journeying in these uninhabited regions, where soap\r\nis scarce, and a laundress not to be had at any price.\r\n\r\nThough very unlike one another, these three youths were brothers.  I\r\nknew them well.  I had seen them before--about two years before--and\r\nthough each had grown several inches taller since that time, I had no\r\ndifficulty in recognising them.  Even though they were now two thousand\r\nmiles from where I had formerly encountered them, I could not be\r\nmistaken as to their identity.  Beyond a doubt they were the same brave\r\nyoung adventurers whom I had met in the swamps of Louisiana, and whose\r\nexploits I had witnessed upon the prairies of Texas.  They were the \"Boy\r\nHunters,\"--Basil, Lucien, Francois!  I was right glad to renew\r\nacquaintance with them.  Boy reader, do you share my joy?\r\n\r\nBut whither go they now?  They are full two thousand miles from their\r\nhome in Louisiana.  The Red River upon which their canoe floats is not\r\nthat Red River, whose blood-like waters sweep through the swamps of the\r\nhot South--the home of the alligator and the gar.  No, it is a stream of\r\na far different character, though also one of great magnitude.  Upon the\r\nbanks of the former ripens the rice-plant, and the sugar-cane waves its\r\ngolden tassels high in the air.  There, too, flourishes the giant reed\r\n(_Arundo gigantea_), the fan-palm (_Chamaerops_), and the broad-leafed\r\nmagnolia, with its huge snow-white flowers.  There the aspect is\r\nSouthern, and the heat tropical for most part of the year.\r\n\r\nAll this is reversed on the Red River of the North.  It is true that on\r\nits banks sugar is also produced; but it is no longer from a plant but a\r\nlordly tree--the great sugar-maple (_Acer saccharinum_).  There is rice\r\ntoo,--vast fields of rice upon its marshy borders; but it is not the\r\npearly grain of the South.  It is the wild rice, \"the water oats\"\r\n(_Zizania aquatica_), the food of millions of winged creatures, and\r\nthousands of human beings as well.  Here for three-fourths of the year\r\nthe sun is feeble, and the aspect that of winter.  For months the cold\r\nwaters are bound up in an icy embrace.  The earth is covered with thick\r\nsnow, over which rise the needle-leafed _coniferae_--the pines, the\r\ncedars, the spruce, and the hemlock.  Very unlike each other are the\r\ncountries watered by the two streams, the Red River of the South and its\r\nnamesake of the North.\r\n\r\nBut whither go our Boy Hunters in their birch-bark canoe?  The river\r\nupon which they are _voyaging_ runs due northward into the great Lake\r\nWinnipeg.  They are floating with its current, and consequently\r\nincreasing the distance from their home.  Whither go they?\r\n\r\nThe answer leads us to some sad reflections.  Our joy on again beholding\r\nthem is to be mingled with grief.  When we last saw them they had a\r\nfather, but no mother.  Now they have neither one nor the\r\nother.  The old Colonel, their father--the French _emigre_, the\r\n_hunter-naturalist_--is dead.  He who had taught them all they knew, who\r\nhad taught them \"to ride, to swim, to dive deep rivers, to fling the\r\nlasso, to climb tall trees, and scale steep cliffs, to bring down birds\r\nupon the wing or beasts upon the run, with the arrow and the unerring\r\nrifle; who had trained them to sleep in the open air, in the dark\r\nforest, on the unsheltered prairie, along the white snow-wreath--\r\nanywhere--with but a blanket or a buffalo-robe for their bed; who had\r\ntaught them to live on the simplest food, and had imparted to one of\r\nthem a knowledge of science, of botany in particular, that enabled them,\r\nin case of need, to draw sustenance from plants and trees, from roots\r\nand fruits, to find resources where ignorant men would starve; had\r\ntaught them to kindle a fire without flint, steel, or detonating powder;\r\nto discover their direction without a compass, from the rocks and the\r\ntrees and the signs of the heavens; and in addition to all, had taught\r\nthem, as far as was then known, the geography of that vast wilderness\r\nthat stretches from the Mississippi to the shores of the Pacific Ocean,\r\nand northward to the icy borders of the Arctic Sea\"--he who had taught\r\nthem all this, their father, was no more; and his three sons, the \"boy\r\nmen,\" of whom he was so proud, and of whose accomplishments he was wont\r\nto boast, were now orphans upon the wide world.\r\n\r\nBut little more than a year after their return from their grand\r\nexpedition to the Texan prairies, the \"old Colonel\" had died.  It was\r\none of the worst years of that scourge of the South--the yellow fever--\r\nand to this dread pestilence he had fallen a victim.\r\n\r\nHugot, the _ex-chasseur_ and attached domestic, who was accustomed to\r\nfollow his master like a shadow, had also followed him into the next\r\nworld.  It was not grief that killed Hugot, though he bore the loss of\r\nhis kind master sadly enough.  But it was not grief that killed Hugot.\r\nHe was laid low by the same disease of which his master had died--the\r\nyellow fever.  A week had scarcely passed after the death of the latter,\r\nbefore Hugot caught the disease, and in a few days he was carried to the\r\ntomb and laid by the side of his \"old Colonel.\"\r\n\r\nThe Boy Hunters--Basil, Lucien, Francois--became orphans.  They knew of\r\nbut _one_ relation in the whole world, with whom their father had kept\r\nup any correspondence.  This relation was an uncle, and, strange as it\r\nmay seem, a Scotchman--a Highlander, who had strayed to Corsica in early\r\nlife, and had there married the Colonel's sister.  That uncle had\r\nafterwards emigrated to Canada, and had become extensively engaged in\r\nthe fur trade.  He was now a superintendent or \"factor\" of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company, stationed at one of their most remote posts near the shores\r\nof the Arctic Sea!  There is a romance in the history of some men wilder\r\nthan any fiction that could be imagined.\r\n\r\nI have not yet answered the question as to where our Boy Hunters were\r\njourneying in their birch-bark canoe.  By this time you will have\r\ndivined the answer.  Certainly, you will say, they were on their way to\r\njoin their uncle in his remote home.  For no other object could they be\r\ntravelling through the wild regions of the Red River.  That supposition\r\nis correct.  To visit this Scotch uncle (they had not seen him for\r\nyears) was the object of their long, toilsome, and perilous journey.\r\nAfter their father's death he had sent for them.  He had heard of their\r\nexploits upon the prairies; and, being himself of an adventurous\r\ndisposition, he was filled with admiration for his young kinsmen, and\r\ndesired very much to have them come and live with him.  Being now their\r\nguardian, he might command as much, but it needed not any exercise of\r\nauthority on his part to induce all three of them to obey his summons.\r\nThey had travelled through the mighty forests of the Mississippi, and\r\nupon the summer prairies of the South.  These great features of the\r\nearth's surface were to them familiar things, and they were no longer\r\ncurious about them.  But there remained a vast country which they longed\r\neagerly to explore.  They longed to look upon its shining lakes and\r\ncrystal rivers; upon its snow-clad hills and ice-bound streams; upon its\r\nhuge mammalia--its moose and its musk-oxen, its wapiti and its monster\r\nbears.  This was the very country to which they were now invited by\r\ntheir kinsman, and cheerfully did they accept his invitation.  Already\r\nhad they made one-half the journey, though by far the easier half.  They\r\nhad travelled up the Mississippi, by steamboat as far as the mouth of\r\nthe Saint Peter's.  There they had commenced their canoe voyage--in\r\nother words became \"voyageurs\"--for such is the name given to those who\r\ntravel by canoes through these wild territories.  Their favourite horses\r\nand the mule \"Jeannette\" had been left behind.  This was a necessity, as\r\nthese creatures, however useful upon the dry prairies of the South,\r\nwhere there are few or no lakes, and where rivers only occur at long\r\nintervals, would be of little service to the traveller in the Northern\r\nregions.  Here the route is crossed and intercepted by numerous rivers;\r\nand lakes of all sizes, with tracts of inundated marsh, succeed one\r\nanother continually.  Such, in fact, are the highways of the country,\r\nand the canoe the travelling carriage; so that a journey from one point\r\nof the Hudson's Bay territory to another is often a canoe voyage of\r\nthousands of miles--equal to a \"trip\" across the Atlantic!\r\n\r\nFollowing the usual custom, therefore, our Boy Hunters had become\r\nvoyageurs--\"_Young Voyageurs_.\"  They had navigated the Saint Peter's in\r\nsafety, almost to its head-waters.  These interlock with the sources of\r\nthe Red River.  By a \"portage\" of a few miles they had crossed to the\r\nlatter stream; and, having launched their canoe upon its waters, were\r\nnow floating downward and northward with its current.  But they had yet\r\na long journey before them--nearly two thousand miles!  Many a river to\r\nbe \"run,\" many a rapid to be \"shot,\" many a lake to be crossed, and many\r\na \"portage\" to be passed, ere they could reach the end of that great\r\n_voyage_.\r\n\r\nCome, boy reader, shall we accompany them?  Yes.  The strange scenes and\r\nwild adventures through which we must pass, may lighten the toils, and\r\nperhaps repay us for the perils, of the journey.  Think not of the\r\ntoils.  Roses grow only upon thorns.  From toil we learn to enjoy\r\nleisure.  Regard not the perils.  \"From the nettle danger we pluck the\r\nflower safety.\"  Security often springs from peril.  From such hard\r\nexperiences great men have arisen.  Come, then, my young friend! mind\r\nneither toil nor peril, but with me to the great wilderness of the\r\nNorth!\r\n\r\nStay!  We are to have another \"_compagnon du voyage_.\"  There is a\r\nfourth in the boat, a fourth \"young voyageur.\"  Who is he?  In\r\nappearance he is as old as Basil, full as tall, and not unlike him in\r\n\"build.\"  But he is altogether of a different _colour_.  He is\r\nfair-haired; but his hair (unlike that of Lucien, which is also\r\nlight-coloured) is strong, crisp, and curly.  It does not droop, but\r\nstands out over his cheeks in a profusion of handsome ringlets.  His\r\ncomplexion is of that kind known as \"fresh,\" and the weather, to which\r\nit has evidently been much exposed, has bronzed and rather enriched the\r\ncolour.  The eyes are dark blue, and, strange to say, with _black_ brows\r\nand lashes!  This is not common, though sometimes observed; and, in the\r\ncase of the youth we are describing, arose from a difference of\r\ncomplexion on the part of his parents.  He looked through the eyes of\r\nhis mother, while in other respects he was more like his father, who was\r\nfair-haired and of a \"fresh\" colour.\r\n\r\nThe youth, himself, might be termed handsome.  Perhaps he did not\r\npossess the youthful beauty of Francois, nor the bolder kind that\r\ncharacterised the face of Basil.  Perhaps he was of a coarser \"make\"\r\nthan any of his three companions.  His intellect had been less\r\ncultivated by education, and _education adds to the beauty of the face_.\r\nHis life had been a harder one--he had toiled more with his hands, and\r\nhad seen less of civilised society.  Still many would have pronounced\r\nhim a handsome youth.  His features were regular, and of clean outline.\r\nHis lips expressed good-nature as well as firmness.  His eye beamed with\r\nnative intelligence, and his whole face bespoke a heart of true and\r\ndetermined honesty--_that made it beautiful_.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a close scrutiniser of countenances might have detected some\r\nresemblance--a family one--between him and his three companions.  If\r\nsuch there was, it was very slight; but there might have been, from the\r\nrelationship that existed between them and him.  He was their cousin--\r\ntheir full cousin--the only son of that uncle they were now on their way\r\nto visit, and the new-comer who had been sent to bring them.  Such was\r\nthe fourth of \"the young voyageurs.\"\r\n\r\nHis dress was not unlike that worn by Basil; but as he was seated on the\r\nbow, and acting as pilot, and therefore more likely to feel the cold, he\r\nwore over his hunting-shirt a Canadian _capote_ of white woollen cloth,\r\nwith its hood hanging, down upon his shoulders.\r\n\r\nBut there was still another \"voyageur,\" an old acquaintance, whom you,\r\nboy reader, will no doubt remember.  This was an animal, a quadruped,\r\nwho lay along the bottom of the canoe upon a buffalo's hide.  \"From his\r\nsize and colour--which was a tawny red--you might have mistaken him for\r\na panther--a cougar.  His long black muzzle and broad hanging ears gave\r\nhim quite a different aspect, however, and declared him to be a hound.\r\nHe _was_ one--a bloodhound, with the build of a mastiff--a powerful\r\nanimal.  He was the dog `Marengo.'\"  You remember Marengo?\r\n\r\nIn the canoe there were other objects of interest.  There were blankets\r\nand buffalo-robes; there was a small canvass tent folded up; there were\r\nbags of provisions, and some cooking utensils; there was a spade and an\r\naxe; there were rifles--three of them--and a double-barrelled shot-gun;\r\nbesides a fish-net, and many other articles, the necessary equipments\r\nfor such a journey.\r\n\r\nLoaded almost to the gunwale was that little canoe, yet lightly did it\r\nfloat down the waters of the Red River of the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE TRUMPETER SWAN AND THE BALD EAGLE.\r\n\r\nIt was the spring season, though late.  The snow had entirely\r\ndisappeared from the hills, and the ice from the water, and the melting\r\nof both had swollen the river, and rendered its current more rapid than\r\nusual.  Our young voyageurs needed not therefore to ply their oars,\r\nexcept now and then to guide the canoe; for these little vessels have no\r\nrudder, but are steered by the paddles.  The skilful voyageurs can shoot\r\nthem to any point they please, simply by their dexterous handling of the\r\noars; and Basil, Lucien, and Francois, had had sufficient practice both\r\nwith \"skiffs\" and \"dugouts\" to make good oarsmen of all three.  They had\r\nmade many a canoe trip upon the lower Mississippi and the bayous of\r\nLouisiana; besides their journey up the Saint Peter's had rendered them\r\nfamiliar with the management of their birchen craft.  An occasional\r\nstroke of the paddle kept them in their course, and they floated on\r\nwithout effort.  Norman--such was the name of their Canadian or Highland\r\ncousin--sat in the bow and directed their course.  This is the post of\r\nhonour in a canoe; and as he had more experience than any of them in\r\nthis sort of navigation, he was allowed habitually to occupy this post.\r\nLucien sat in the stern.  He held in his hands a book and pencil; and as\r\nthe canoe glided onward, he was noting down his memoranda.  The trees\r\nupon the banks were in leaf--many of them in blossom--and as the little\r\ncraft verged near the shore, his keen eye followed the configuration of\r\nthe leaves, to discover any new species that might appear.  There is a\r\nrich vegetation upon the banks of the Red River; but the _flora_ is far\r\ndifferent from that which appears upon the low _alluvion_ of Louisiana.\r\nIt is Northern, but not Arctic.  Oaks, elms, and poplars, are seen\r\nmingling with birches, willows, and aspens.  Several species of\r\nindigenous fruit trees were observed by Lucien, among which were\r\ncrab-apple, raspberry, strawberry, and currant.  There was also seen the\r\nfruit called by the voyageurs \"le poire,\" but which in English\r\nphraseology is known as the \"service-berry\" (_Amelanchier ovalis_).  It\r\ngrows upon a small bush or shrub of six or eight feet high, with smooth\r\npinnate leaves.  These pretty red berries are much esteemed and eaten\r\nboth by Indians and whites, who preserve them by drying, and cook them\r\nin various ways.  There was still another bush that fixed the attention\r\nof our young botanist, as it appeared all along the banks, and was a\r\n_characteristic_ of the vegetation of the country.  It was not over\r\neight feet in height, with spreading branches of a grey colour.  Its\r\nleaves were three inches wide, and somewhat lobed liked those of the\r\noak.  Of course, at this early season, the fruit was not ripe upon it;\r\nbut Lucien knew the fruit well.  When ripe it resembles very much a red\r\ncherry, or, still more, a cranberry, having both the appearance and\r\nacrid taste of the latter.  Indeed, it is sometimes used as a substitute\r\nfor cranberries in the making of pies and tarts; and in many parts it is\r\ncalled the \"bush cranberry.\"  The name, however, by which it is known\r\namong the Indians of Red River is \"_anepeminan_,\" from \"_nepen_,\"\r\nsummer, and \"_minan_\" berry.  This has been corrupted by the fur-traders\r\nand voyageurs into \"Pembina;\" hence, the name of a river which runs into\r\nthe Red, and also he name of the celebrated but unsuccessful settlement\r\nof \"Pembina,\" formed by Lord Selkirk many years ago.  Both took their\r\nnames from this berry that grows in abundance in the neighbourhood.  The\r\nbotanical appellation of this curious shrub is _Viburnum oxycoccos_; but\r\nthere is another species of the viburnum, which is also styled\r\n\"oxycoccos.\"  The common \"snowball bush\" of our gardens is a plant of\r\nthe same genus, and very like the \"Pembina\" both in leaf and flower.  In\r\nfact, in a wild state they might be regarded as the same; but it is\r\nwell-known that the flowers of the snowball are sterile, and do not\r\nproduce the beautiful bright crimson berries of the \"Pembina.\"  Lucien\r\nlectured upon these points to his companions as they floated along.\r\nNorman listened with astonishment to his philosophic cousin, who,\r\nalthough he had never been in this region before, knew more of its\r\nplants and trees than he did himself.  Basil also was interested in the\r\nexplanations given by his brother.  On the contrary, Francois, who cared\r\nbut little for botanical studies, or studies of any sort, was occupied\r\ndifferently.  He sat near the middle of the canoe, double-barrel in\r\nhand, eagerly watching for a shot.  Many species of water-fowl were upon\r\nthe river, for it was now late in the spring, and the wild geese and\r\nducks had all arrived, and were passing northward upon their annual\r\nmigration.  During the day Francois had got several shots, and had\r\n\"bagged\" three wild geese, all of different kinds, for there are many\r\nspecies of wild geese in America.  He had also shot some ducks.  But\r\nthis did not satisfy him.  There was a bird upon the river that could\r\nnot be approached.  No matter how the canoe was manoeuvred, this shy\r\ncreature always took flight before Francois could get within range.  For\r\ndays he had been endeavouring to kill one.  Even upon the Saint Peter's\r\nmany of them had been seen, sometimes in pairs, at other times in small\r\nflocks of six or seven, but always shy and wary.  The very difficulty of\r\ngetting a shot at them, along with the splendid character of the birds\r\nthemselves, had rendered Francois eager to obtain one.  The bird itself\r\nwas no other than the great wild swan--the king of aquatic birds.\r\n\r\n\"Come, brother!\" said Francois, addressing Lucien, \"bother your\r\nviburnums and your oxycocks!  Tell us something about these swans.  See!\r\nthere goes another of them!  What a splendid fellow he is!  I'd give\r\nsomething to have him within range of buck-shot.\"\r\n\r\nAs Francois spoke he pointed down-stream to a great white bird that was\r\nseen moving out from the bank.  It was a swan, and one of the very\r\nlargest kind--a \"trumpeter\" (_Cygnus buccinator_).\r\n\r\nIt had been feeding in a sedge of the wild rice (_Zizania aquatica_),\r\nand no doubt the sight of the canoe or the plash of the guiding oar had\r\ndisturbed, and given it the alarm.  It shot out from the reeds with head\r\nerect and wings slightly raised, offering to the eyes of the voyageurs a\r\nspectacle of graceful and majestic bearing, that, among the feathered\r\nrace at least, is quite inimitable.\r\n\r\nA few strokes of its broad feet propelled it into the open water near\r\nthe middle of the stream, when, making a half wheel, it turned head down\r\nthe river, and swam with the current.\r\n\r\nAt the point where it turned it was not two hundred yards ahead of the\r\ncanoe.  Its apparent boldness in permitting them to come so near without\r\ntaking wing, led Francois to hope that they might get still nearer; and,\r\nbegging his companions to ply the paddles, he seized hold of his\r\ndouble-barrel, and leaned forward in the canoe.  Basil also conceived a\r\nhope that a shot was to be had, for he took up his rifle, and looked to\r\nthe cock and cap.  The others went steadily and quietly to work at the\r\noars.  In a few moments the canoe cleft the current at the rate of a\r\ngalloping horse, and one would have supposed that the swan must either\r\nat once take wing or be overtaken.\r\n\r\nNot so, however.  The \"trumpeter\" knew his game better than that.  He\r\nhad full confidence both in his strength and speed upon the water.  He\r\nwas not going to undergo the trouble of a fly, until the necessity arose\r\nfor so doing; and, as it was, he seemed to be satisfied that that\r\nnecessity had not yet arrived.  The swim cost him much less muscular\r\nexertion than flying would have done, and he judged that the current,\r\nhere very swift, would carry him out of reach of his pursuers.\r\n\r\nIt soon began to appear that he judged rightly; and the voyageurs, to\r\ntheir chagrin, saw that, instead of gaining upon him, as they had\r\nexpected, every moment widened the distance between him and the canoe.\r\nThe bird had an advantage over his pursuers.  Three distinct powers\r\npropelled him, while they had only two to rely upon.  He had the current\r\nin his favour--so had they.  He had oars or paddles--his feet; they had\r\noars as well.  He \"carried sail,\" while they spread not a \"rag.\"  The\r\nwind chanced to blow directly down-stream, and the broad wings of the\r\nbird, held out from his body, and half extended, caught the very pith of\r\nthe breeze on their double concave surfaces, and carried him through the\r\nwater with the velocity of an arrow.  Do you think that he was not aware\r\nof this advantage when he started in the race?  Do you suppose that\r\nthese birds do not _think_?  I for one am satisfied they do, and look\r\nupon every one who prates about the _instinct_ of these creatures as a\r\nphilosopher of a very old school indeed.  Not only does the great swan\r\nthink, but so does your parrot, and your piping bullfinch, and the\r\nlittle canary that hops on your thumb.  All think, and _reason_, and\r\n_judge_.  Should it ever be your fortune to witness the performance of\r\nthose marvellous birds, exhibited by the graceful Mademoiselle\r\nVandermeersch in the fashionable _salons_ of Paris and London, you will\r\nagree with me in the belief that the smallest of them has a mind like\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nMost certainly the swan, which our voyageurs were pursuing, thought, and\r\nreasoned, and judged, and calculated his distance, and resolved to keep\r\non \"the even tenor of his way,\" without putting himself to extra trouble\r\nby beating the air with his wings, and lifting his heavy body--thirty\r\npounds at least--up into the heavens.  His judgment proved sound; for,\r\nin less than ten minutes from the commencement of the chase, he had\r\ngained a clear hundred yards upon his pursuers, and continued to widen\r\nthe distance.  At intervals he raised his beak higher than usual, and\r\nuttered his loud booming note, which fell upon the ears of the voyageurs\r\nas though it had been sent back in mockery and defiance.\r\n\r\nThey would have given up the pursuit, had they not noticed that a few\r\nhundred yards farther down the river made a sharp turn to the right.\r\nThe swan, on reaching this, would no longer have the wind in his favour.\r\nThis inspired them with fresh hopes.  They thought they would be able\r\nto overtake him after passing the bend, and then, either get a shot at\r\nhim, or force him into the air.  The latter was the more likely; and,\r\nalthough it would be no great gratification to see him fly off, yet they\r\nhad become so interested in this singular chase that they desired to\r\nterminate it by putting the trumpeter to some trouble.  They bent,\r\ntherefore, with fresh energy to their oars, and pulled onward in the\r\npursuit.  First the swan, and after him the canoe, swung round the bend,\r\nand entered the new \"reach\" of the river.  The voyageurs at once\r\nperceived that the bird now swam more slowly.  He no longer \"carried\r\nsail,\" as the wind was no longer in his favour.  His wings lay closely\r\nfolded to his body, and he moved only by the aid of his webbed feet and\r\nthe current, which last happened to be sluggish, as the river at this\r\npart spread over a wide expanse of level land.  The canoe was evidently\r\ncatching up, and each stroke was bringing the pursuers nearer to the\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes' brisk pulling, the trumpeter had lost so much\r\nground that he was not two hundred yards in the advance, and \"dead\r\nahead.\"  His body was no longer carried with the same gracefulness, and\r\nthe majestic curving of his neck had disappeared.  His bill protruded\r\nforward, and his thighs began to drag the water in his wake.  He was\r\nevidently on the threshold of flight.  Both Francois and Basil saw this,\r\nas they stood with their guns crossed and ready.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a shrill cry sounded over the water.  It was the scream\r\nof some wild creature, ending in a strange laugh, like the laugh of a\r\nmaniac!\r\n\r\nOn both sides of the river there was a thick forest of tall trees of the\r\ncotton-wood species (_Populus angustifolia_).  From this forest the\r\nstrange cry had proceeded, and from the right bank.  Its echoes had\r\nhardly ceased, when it was answered by a similar cry from the trees upon\r\nthe left.  So like were the two, that it seemed as if some one of God's\r\nwild creatures was mocking another.  These cries were hideous enough to\r\nfrighten any one not used to them.  They had not that effect upon our\r\nvoyageurs, who knew their import.  One and all of them were familiar\r\nwith the voice of the _white-headed eagle_!\r\n\r\nThe trumpeter knew it as well as any of them, but on him it produced a\r\nfar different effect.  His terror was apparent, and his intention was\r\nall at once changed.  Instead of rising into the air, as he had\r\npremeditated, he suddenly lowered his head, and disappeared under the\r\nwater!\r\n\r\nAgain was heard the wild scream and the maniac laugh; and the next\r\nmoment an eagle swept out from the timber, and, after a few strokes of\r\nits broad wing, poised itself over the spot where the trumpeter had gone\r\ndown.  The other, its mate, was seen crossing at the same time from the\r\nopposite side.\r\n\r\nPresently the swan rose to the surface, but his head was hardly out of\r\nthe water when the eagle once more uttered its wild note, and, half\r\nfolding its wings, darted down from above.  The swan seemed to have\r\nexpected this, for before the eagle could reach the surface, he had gone\r\nunder a second time, and the latter, though passing with the velocity of\r\nan arrow, plunged his talons in the water to no purpose.  With a cry of\r\ndisappointment the eagle mounted back into the air, and commenced\r\nwheeling in circles over the spot.  It was now joined by its mate, and\r\nboth kept round and round watching for the reappearance of their\r\nintended victim.\r\n\r\nAgain the swan came to the surface, but before either of the eagles\r\ncould swoop upon him he had for the third time disappeared.  The swan is\r\nbut an indifferent diver; but under such circumstances he was likely to\r\ndo his best at it.  But what could it avail him?  He must soon rise to\r\nthe surface to take breath--each time at shorter intervals.  He would\r\nsoon become fatigued and unable to dive with sufficient celerity, and\r\nthen his cruel enemies would be down upon him with their terrible\r\ntalons.  Such is the usual result, unless the swan takes to the air,\r\nwhich he sometimes does.  In the present case he had built his hopes\r\nupon a different means of escape.  He contemplated being able to conceal\r\nhimself in a heavy sedge of bulrushes (_Scirpus lacustris_) that grew\r\nalong the edge of the river, and towards these he was evidently\r\ndirecting his course under the water.  At each emersion he appeared some\r\nyards nearer them, until at length he rose within a few feet of their\r\nmargin, and diving again was seen no more!  He had crept in among the\r\nsedge, and no doubt was lying with only his head, or part of it, above\r\nthe water, his body concealed by the broad leaves of the _nymphae_,\r\nwhile the head itself could not be distinguished among the white flowers\r\nthat lay thickly along the surface.  The eagles now wheeled over the\r\nsedge, flapping the tops of the bulrushes with their broad wings, and\r\nscreaming with disappointed rage.  Keen as were their eyes they could\r\nnot discover the hiding-place of their victim.  No doubt they would have\r\nsearched for it a long while, but the canoe--which they now appeared to\r\nnotice for the first time--had floated near; and, becoming aware of\r\ntheir own danger, both mounted into the air again, and with a farewell\r\nscream flew off, and alighted at some distance down the river.\r\n\r\n\"A swan for supper!\" shouted Francois, as he poised his gun for the\r\nexpected shot.\r\n\r\nThe canoe was headed for the bulrushes near the point where the\r\ntrumpeter had been last seen; and a few strokes of the paddles brought\r\nthe little craft with a whizzing sound among the sedge.  But the culms\r\nof the rushes were so tall, and grew so closely together, that the\r\ncanoemen, after entering, found to their chagrin they could not see six\r\nfeet around them.  They dared not stand up, for this is exceedingly\r\ndangerous in a birch canoe, where the greatest caution is necessary to\r\nkeep the vessel from careening over.  Moreover, the sedge was so thick,\r\nthat it was with difficulty they could use their oars.  They remained\r\nstationary for a time, surrounded by a wall of green bulrush.  They soon\r\nperceived that that would never do, and resolved to push back into the\r\nopen water.  Meanwhile Marengo had been sent into the sedge, and was now\r\nheard plunging and sweltering about in search of the game.  Marengo was\r\nnot much of a water-dog by nature, but he had been trained to almost\r\nevery kind of hunting, and his experience among the swamps of Louisiana\r\nhad long since relieved him of all dread for the water.  His masters\r\ntherefore had no fear but that Marengo would \"put up\" the trumpeter.\r\n\r\nMarengo had been let loose a little too soon.  Before the canoe could be\r\ncleared of the entangling sedge, the dog was heard to utter one of his\r\nloud growls, then followed a heavy plunge, there was a confused\r\nfluttering of wings, and the great white bird rose majestically into the\r\nair!  Before either of the gunners could direct their aim, he was beyond\r\nthe range of shot, and both prudently reserved their fire.  Marengo\r\nhaving performed his part, swam back to the canoe, and was lifted over\r\nthe gunwale.  The swan, after clearing the sedge, rose almost vertically\r\ninto the air.  These birds usually fly at a great elevation--sometimes\r\nentirely beyond the reach of sight.  Unlike the wild geese and ducks,\r\nthey never alight upon land, but always upon the bosom of the water.  It\r\nwas evidently the intention of this one to go far from the scene of his\r\nlate dangers, perhaps to the great Lake Winnipeg itself.  After\r\nattaining a height of several hundred yards, he flew forward in a\r\nhorizontal course, and followed the direction of the stream.  His flight\r\nwas now regular, and his trumpet-note could be heard at intervals, as,\r\nwith outstretched neck, he glided along the heavens.  He seemed to feel\r\nthe pleasant sensations that every creature has after an escape from\r\ndanger, and no doubt he fancied himself secure.  But in this fancy he\r\ndeceived himself.  Better for him had he risen a few hundred yards\r\nhigher, or else had uttered his self-gratulation in a more subdued tone;\r\nfor it was heard and answered, and that response was the maniac laugh of\r\nthe white-headed eagle.  At the same instant two of these birds--those\r\nalready introduced--were seen mounting into the air.  They did not fly\r\nup vertically, as the swan had done, but in spiral curves, wheeling and\r\ncrossing each other as they ascended.  They were making for a point that\r\nwould intersect the flight of the swan should he keep on in his\r\nhorizontal course.  This, however, he did not do.  With an eye as quick\r\nas theirs, he saw that he was \"headed;\" and, stretching his long neck\r\nupward, he again pursued an almost vertical line.  But he had to carry\r\nthirty pounds of flesh and bones, while the largest of the eagles--the\r\nfemale bird--with a still broader spread of wing, was a \"light weight\"\r\nof only seven.  The result of this difference was soon apparent.  Before\r\nthe trumpeter had got two hundred yards higher, the female of the eagles\r\nwas seen wheeling around him on the same level.  The swan was now\r\nobserved to double, fly downward, and then upward again, while his\r\nmournful note echoed back to the earth.  But his efforts were in vain.\r\nAfter a series of contortions and manoeuvres, the eagle darted forward,\r\nwith a quick toss threw herself back downward, and, striking upward,\r\nplanted her talons in the under part of the wing of her victim.  The\r\nlacerated shaft fell uselessly down; and the great white bird, no longer\r\ncapable of flight, came whistling through the air.  But it was not\r\nallowed to drop directly to the earth; it would have fallen on the bosom\r\nof the broad river, and that the eagles did not wish, as it would have\r\ngiven them some trouble to get the heavy carcass ashore.  As soon as the\r\nmale--who was lower in the air--saw that his partner had struck the\r\nbird, he discontinued his upward flight, and, poising himself on his\r\nspread tail, waited its descent.  A single instant was sufficient.  The\r\nwhite object passed him still fluttering; but the moment it was below\r\nhis level he shot after it like an arrow, and, clutching it in his\r\ntalons, with an outward stroke sent it whizzing in a diagonal direction.\r\nThe next moment a crashing was heard among the twigs, and a dull sound\r\nannounced that the swan had fallen upon the earth.\r\n\r\nThe eagles were now seen sailing downward, and soon disappeared among\r\nthe tops of the trees.\r\n\r\nThe canoe soon reached the bank; and Francois, accompanied by Basil and\r\nMarengo, leaped ashore, and went in search of the birds.  They found the\r\nswan quite dead and lying upon its back as the eagles had turned it.\r\nIts breast was torn open, and the crimson blood, with which they had\r\nbeen gorging themselves, was spread in broad flakes over its snowy\r\nplumage.  The eagles themselves, scared by the dog Marengo, had taken\r\nflight before the boys could get within shot of them.\r\n\r\nAs it was just the hour for a \"noon halt\" and a luncheon, the swan was\r\ncarried to the bank of the river, where a crackling fire was soon\r\nkindled to roast him; and while this operation was going on the\r\n\"naturalist\" was requested by his companions to give them an account of\r\nthe \"swans of America.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE SWANS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" said Lucien, agreeing to the request.  \"I shall tell\r\nyou all I know of the swans; and, indeed, that is not much, as the\r\nnatural history of these birds in their wild state is but little\r\nunderstood.  On account of their shy habits, there is not much\r\nopportunity of observing them; and as they annually migrate and breed in\r\nthose desolate regions within the Arctic circle, where civilised men do\r\nnot live, but little information has been collected about them.  Some of\r\nthe species, however, breed in the temperate zones, and the habits of\r\nthese are better known.\r\n\r\n\"For a long time it was fancied there was but one species of swan.  It\r\nis now known that there are several, distinguished from each other in\r\nform, colour, voice, and habits.  `White as a swan,' is a simile as old,\r\nperhaps; as language itself.  This, I fancy, would sound strangely to\r\nthe ears of a native Australian, who is accustomed to look upon swans as\r\nbeing of the very opposite colour, for the black swan is a native of\r\nthat country.\r\n\r\n\"According to the naturalist Brehm, who has given much attention to this\r\nsubject, there are four distinct species of swans in Europe.  They are\r\nall white, though some of the species have a reddish orange tinge about\r\nthe head and neck.  Two of them are `gibbous,' that is, with a knob or\r\nprotuberance upon the upper part of the bill.  One of these Brehm terms\r\nthe `white-headed gibbous swan' (_Cygnus gibbus_).  The other is the\r\n`yellow-headed' (_Cygnus olor_); and this last also is known as the\r\n_mute_ or _tame_ swan, because it is that species most commonly seen in\r\na tame state upon the ornamental lakes and ponds of England.  The other\r\ntwo European species Brehm has designated `singing swans,' as both of\r\nthem utter a note that may be heard to a considerable distance.\r\n\r\n\"The black swan of Australia (_Cygnus niger_) has been naturalised in\r\nEurope, and breeds freely in England, where, from its great size and\r\npeculiar markings, it is one of the most ornamental of water-fowls.  It\r\nis, moreover, a great tyrant, and will not permit other birds to\r\napproach its haunt, but drives them off, striking them furiously with\r\nits strong broad wings.\r\n\r\n\"Until a late period the swans of America were supposed to be all of one\r\nkind.  This is not the case.  There are now known to be three distinct\r\nspecies inhabiting the fur countries, and migrating annually to the\r\nSouth.  That which is best known is the `whistler,' or `hooper' (_Cygnus\r\nAmericanus_), because it is the species that abounds in the old States\r\nupon the Atlantic, and was therefore more observed by naturalists.  It\r\nis believed to be identical with one of the European `singing' swans\r\n(_Cygnus ferus_), but this is not certain; and for my part, I believe\r\nthey are different, as the eggs of the American swan are greenish, while\r\nthose of its European congener are brownish, with white blotches.\r\n\r\n\"The `hooper' is four and a half feet in length, though there are males\r\nstill larger, some of them measuring five feet.  Its colour is white,\r\nexcept upon the head and back part of the neck, where there is a coppery\r\ntinge.  The bill and feet are black.  From the angle of the mouth to the\r\neye there is a small naked `cere,' of a bright yellow colour.  These\r\nswans, like others of the genus, do not care much for the salt water.\r\nThey are rarely seen upon the sea, except near its shores, where they\r\nmay find the aquatic plants upon which they feed.  Nor do they go out\r\nupon the large lakes.  When found upon these, it is generally close in\r\nto the land.  This is accounted for by the fact that the swans do not\r\n`dive' for their food, but stretch down for it with their long necks,\r\nwhich Nature has peculiarly adapted to this very purpose.  Their\r\nfavourite food consists of the roots of aquatic plants, which are often\r\nfarinaceous.  As these grow best in the shallow small lakes and along\r\nthe margins of rivers, such places are the usual resort of the swans.\r\nAlthough their diet is a vegetable one, it is not exclusively so, as\r\nthey will eat frogs, worms, and small fish.  Unlike the ducks and geese,\r\nthey rarely feed upon land, but while floating upon the surface of the\r\nwater.  They walk but awkwardly on land, and are at home only on water\r\nor in the air.  In the air they are quite at home, and fly so swiftly\r\nthat it is no easy matter to shoot them, especially when going before\r\nthe wind.  At such times they are supposed to fly at the rate of one\r\nhundred miles an hour.  When moulting, and unable to rise into the air,\r\nit is no easy matter to follow them even with a canoe.  By means of\r\ntheir broad feet and strong wings, they can flutter so quickly over the\r\nwater, now and then diving, that the hunter cannot overtake them in his\r\nboat, but is obliged to use his gun in the pursuit.\r\n\r\n\"The `hoopers' are migratory,--that is, they pass to the north every\r\nspring, and southward again in the autumn.  Why they make these annual\r\nmigrations, remains one of the mysteries of nature.  Some believe they\r\nmigrate to the north, because they there find those desolate uninhabited\r\nregions where they can bring forth their young in security.  But this\r\nexplanation cannot be the true one, as there are also uninhabited\r\nregions in the south, even under the equator, where they may be equally\r\nfree from the presence of man.  Another explanation might be offered.\r\nIn hot and tropical countries most of the small lakes and swamps, where\r\nthese birds love to dwell, dry up during the summer months: hence the\r\nnecessity of a migration to colder and moister regions.  But this would\r\nonly hold good of the wading and water birds; it would not account for\r\nthe migration of the many other birds of passage.\r\n\r\n\"A better explanation may be this: The north and the cold zones are the\r\nnatural habitat of most migratory birds.  It is there that they bring\r\nforth their young, and there they are at home.  In tropical regions they\r\nare only sojourners for a season, forced thither, some of them, by a\r\ncold which they do not relish; but others, such as the water-fowl, by\r\nthe frost, which, binding up the lakes, rivers, and swamps, hinders them\r\nfrom procuring their food.  They are thus compelled to make an annual\r\nmigration to the open waters of the South, but as soon as the ice has\r\ngiven way before the genial breath of spring, they all return rejoicing\r\nto their favourite home in the North, when their season of love\r\ncommences.\r\n\r\n\"The `hoopers' follow this general law, and migrate to the northward\r\nevery spring.  They breed upon islets in the numerous lakes that stud\r\nthe whole northern part of the American continent.  Eminences in swamps\r\nare also chosen for breeding places, and the ends of promontories that\r\njut out into the water.  The spot selected is always such that the swan,\r\nwhen seated upon her nest, can have a view of the surrounding country,\r\nand detect any enemy long before it can approach her.  The top of the\r\ndome-shaped dwellings of the musk-rat, or musquash (_Fibre zibethicus_),\r\nis often selected by the swan for her nest.  These curious little houses\r\nare usually in the midst of impenetrable swamps: they are only occupied\r\nby their builders during the winter; and as they are deserted by them in\r\nearly spring, they are therefore quite at the service of the swan for\r\nthe `balance of the season.'  The bird makes a large cavity in the top,\r\nand lines it with such reeds and grass as may be found near the spot.\r\n\r\n\"The hooper lays from six to eight eggs, and sits upon them for a period\r\nof six weeks, when the cygnets come forth covered with a thick down of a\r\nbluish-grey colour.  While sitting upon her eggs, the swan is\r\nexceedingly watchful and shy.  She `faces' towards the point whence she\r\nmost apprehends danger.  When the weather is severe, and the wind cold\r\nand keen, she changes into that position which is most comfortable.  If\r\nher nest be upon a promontory instead of an island, she usually sits\r\nwith her head to the land, as she feels secure that no enemy will reach\r\nher from the waterside.  From the land she has not only man to `look\r\nout' for, but the wolverene (_Gulo luscus_), the lynx (_Felis\r\nCanadensis_), foxes, and wolves.\r\n\r\n\"The Indians often snare the swan upon her nest.  Of course the snare--a\r\nrunning noose made from the intestines of the deer--is set in her\r\nabsence.  It is placed upon the side by which she enters, as these birds\r\nenter and leave the nest upon opposite sides.  The snare must be\r\narranged with great care, and with _clean hands_; and the Indians always\r\ntake the precaution to wash their hands before setting it, else the\r\nswans, whose sense of smell is very acute, will perceive the presence of\r\ndanger, and will not only keep away for a time, but sometimes desert the\r\neggs altogether.  There are many other birds that have a similar habit.\r\n\r\n\"So much for the `hooper,'\" continued Lucien; \"now for the `trumpeter.'\r\nThis is the largest of the American swans, being found to measure\r\nseventy inches in length.  Its specific name `trumpeter' (Cygnus\r\n_buccinator_) is given to it on account of its note, which resembles the\r\nsound of a French horn, or trumpet, played at a distance.  The bird is\r\nwhite, with black bill and feet, and has also a reddish orange or copper\r\ntinge upon the crown and neck; but it wants the yellow spot between the\r\nsplit of the mandibles and the eye.  It is easily distinguished from the\r\nhooper, both by its louder note and larger body.  Its habits, however,\r\nare very similar, except that it seems to be more gregarious,--small\r\nflocks of six or eight often appearing together, while the hooper is\r\nseen only in pairs, and sometimes solitary.  Another distinction is,\r\nthat the trumpeter arrives much earlier in its migrations to the North,\r\nbeing the earliest bird that appears except the eagles.  It breeds as\r\nfar South as latitude 61 degrees, but most generally within the Arctic\r\ncircle.  Its nest is constructed similarly to those of the hooper, but\r\nits eggs are much larger, one of them being a meal for a moderate eater,\r\nwithout bread or any other addition.  The trumpeter frequently arrives\r\nin the North before the lakes or rivers are thawed.  It is then obliged\r\nto find sustenance at the rapids and waterfalls, where the Indians can\r\napproach under cover, and many are shot at such times by these people.\r\nAt all other times, as you, Francois, have observed, it is a bird most\r\ndifficult of approach; and the Indian hunters only attempt it when they\r\nhave a long-range gun loaded with ball.\r\n\r\n\"The third species of American swans is that known as Bewick's swan\r\n(Cygnus _Bewickii_), called after the naturalist of that name.  It is\r\nthe smallest of the three, rarely measuring over fifty-two inches in\r\nlength, and weighing only fourteen pounds, while the hooper is over\r\ntwenty pounds in weight, and the trumpeter is often obtained of the\r\nenormous weight of thirty!\r\n\r\n\"Bewick's swan is also said to be identical with one of Brehm's singing\r\nswans.  Its colour is almost similar to that of the hooper, and the two\r\nare often mistaken for each other.  The size and the tail-feathers of\r\nall three of the American swans form a sufficiently specific\r\ndistinction.  In the trumpeter these are twenty-four in number, in the\r\nhooper twenty, while the small species has only eighteen.\r\n\r\n\"Of the three, the last-mentioned is the latest on its annual journey,\r\nbut it breeds farther North than either of the others.  Its nest is\r\nfound upon the islands of the Arctic Sea; it is usually built of\r\npeat-moss, and is of gigantic dimensions, being six feet long by five in\r\nwidth, and nearly two feet high.  In the top of this pile is the nest\r\nitself, forming a large round cavity nearly two feet in diameter.  The\r\neggs are of a brownish white, with clouds of darker tint.\r\n\r\n\"I have remarked,\" continued Lucien, \"a singularity in the geographical\r\ndistribution of these three species.  Upon the Pacific coast the\r\nsmallest kind and the hooper only are met with, and the small ones\r\noutnumber the others in the ratio of five to one.  In the interior parts\r\nof the continent only the hoopers and trumpeters appear; and the\r\ntrumpeters are by far the most numerous, while upon the eastern coasts\r\nof America the hoopers are the sort best known.\r\n\r\n\"The swans are eagerly hunted both by the Indians and white hunters.\r\nTheir skins, with the quills and down, form a source of profit to the\r\nnatives of the fur countries, who dispose of them to the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany.  In some years as many as ten thousand skins have been\r\nexported, and sold at the rate of six or seven shillings each.  Most of\r\nthe skins thus sold were those of the trumpeter swans, which are the\r\nmost numerous.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Lucien, in conclusion, \"you know as much about the swans as\r\nI do; so I shall drop the subject, and recommend to all of you a piece\r\nof roast swan, which is now just done to a turn, and which I doubt not\r\nwill be found less dry than my lecture.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nA SWAN-HUNT BY TORCHLIGHT.\r\n\r\nA few days brought our travellers to the settlement of Red River, where\r\nthey made but a very short stay; and, having procured a few articles\r\nwhich they stood in need of, they resumed their journey, and floated on\r\ntowards Lake Winnipeg.  The swans were seen in greater numbers than\r\never.  They were not less shy however, and Francois, as before, in vain\r\ntried to get a shot at one.  He was very desirous of bringing down one\r\nof these noble birds, partly because the taste he had had of their flesh\r\nhad given him a liking for it; and partly because their shyness had\r\ngreatly tantalised him.  One is always more eager to kill shy game, both\r\non account of the rarity of the thing, and the credit one gets for his\r\nexpertness.  But the voyageurs had now got within less than twenty miles\r\nof Lake Winnipeg, and Francois had not as yet shot a single swan.  It\r\nwas not at all likely the eagles would help him to another.  So there\r\nwould be no more roast swan for supper.\r\n\r\nNorman, seeing how eager Francois was to shoot one of these birds,\r\nresolved to aid him by his advice.\r\n\r\n\"Cousin Frank,\" said he, one evening as they floated along, \"you wish\r\nvery much to get a shot at the swans?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" replied Francois,--\"I do; and if you can tell me how to\r\naccomplish that business, I'll make you a present of this knife.\"  Here\r\nFrancois held up a very handsome clasp-knife that he carried in his\r\npouch.\r\n\r\nA knife in the fur countries is no insignificant affair.  With a knife\r\nyou may sometimes buy a horse, or a tent, or a whole carcass of beef,\r\nor, what is stranger still, a wife!  To the hunter in these wild\r\nregions--perhaps a thousand miles from where knives are sold--such a\r\nthing is of very great value indeed; but the knife which Francois\r\noffered to his cousin was a particularly fine one, and the latter had\r\nonce expressed a wish to become the owner of it.  He was not slow,\r\ntherefore, in accepting the conditions.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" rejoined he, \"you must consent to travel a few miles by night,\r\nand I think I can promise you a shot at the trumpeters--perhaps\r\nseveral.\"\r\n\r\n\"What say you, brothers?\" asked Francois, appealing to Basil and Lucien;\r\n\"shall we have the sport?  Say yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  I have no objection,\" said Lucien.\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" added Basil.  \"On the contrary, I should like it above all\r\nthings.  I wish very much to know what plan our cousin shall adopt.  I\r\nnever heard of any mode of approaching these birds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" answered Norman, \"I shall have the pleasure of\r\ninstructing you in a way that is in use in these parts among the\r\nIndians, who hunt the swan for its skin and quills, which they trade to\r\nus at the post.  We can manage it to-night, I think,\" continued he,\r\nlooking up at the sky: \"there is no moon, and the sky is thick.  Yes, it\r\nwill be dark enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it necessary the night should be a dark one?\" asked Francois.\r\n\r\n\"The darker the better,\" replied Norman.  \"To-night, if I am not\r\nmistaken, will be as black as pitch.  But we need to make some\r\npreparations.  It is near sundown, and we shall have just time to get\r\nready for the business.  Let us get ashore, then, as quickly as\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! certainly--let us land,\" replied all three at once.\r\n\r\nThe canoe was now turned to the shore; and when it had arrived within a\r\nfew feet of the land it was brought to a stop.  Its keel was not allowed\r\nto touch the bottom of the river, as that would have injured the little\r\ncraft.  The greatest precaution is always observed both in landing and\r\nembarking these vessels.  The voyageurs first get out and wade to the\r\nshore, one or two remaining to hold the canoe in its place.  The cargo,\r\nwhatever it be, is then taken out and landed; and after that the canoe\r\nitself is lifted out of the water, and carried ashore, where it is set,\r\nbottom upward, to dry.  The birch-bark canoe is so frail a structure,\r\nthat, were it brought rudely in contact either with the bottom or the\r\nbank, it would be very much damaged, or might go to pieces altogether.\r\nHence the care with which it is handled.  It is dangerous, also, to\r\nstand upright in it, as it is so \"crank\" that it would easily turn over,\r\nand spill both canoemen and cargo into the water.  The voyageurs,\r\ntherefore, when once they have got in, remain seated during the whole\r\npassage, shifting about as little as they can help.  When landed for the\r\nnight, the canoe is always taken out of the water as described.  The\r\nbark is of a somewhat spongy nature; and if left in the water for a\r\nlength of time, would become soaked and heavy, and would not run so\r\nwell.  When kept all night, bottom upward, it drips and becomes dryer\r\nand lighter.  In the morning, at the commencement of the day's journey,\r\nit sits higher upon the water than in the afternoon and evening, and is\r\nat that time more easily paddled along.\r\n\r\nOur voyageurs, having got on shore, first kindled a fire to cook their\r\nsupper.  This they intended to despatch earlier than usual, so as to\r\ngive them the early part of the night for their swan-hunt, which they\r\nexpected to finish before midnight.  Lucien did the cooking, while\r\nNorman, assisted by Basil and Francois, made his preparations for the\r\nhunt.  Francois, who was more interested in the result than any of them,\r\nwatched every movement of his cousin.  Nothing escaped him.\r\n\r\nNorman proceeded as follows:--\r\n\r\nHe walked off into the woods, accompanied by Francois.  After going\r\nabout an hundred yards or so, he stopped at the foot of a certain tree.\r\nThe tree was a birch--easily distinguished by its smooth, silvery bark.\r\nBy means of his sharp hunting-knife he \"girdled\" this tree near the\r\nground, and then higher up, so that the length between the two\r\n\"girdlings,\" or circular cuttings, was about four feet.  He then made a\r\nlongitudinal incision by drawing the point of his knife from one circle\r\nto the other.  This done he inserted the blade under the bark, and\r\npeeled it off, as he would have taken the skin from a buffalo.  The tree\r\nwas a foot in diameter, consequently the bark, when stripped off and\r\nspread flat, was about three feet in width; for you must remember that\r\nthe circumference of a circle or a cylinder is always about three times\r\nthe length of its diameter, and therefore a tree is three times as much\r\n\"_round_\" as it is \"_through_.\"\r\n\r\nThey now returned to the camp-fire, taking along with them the piece of\r\nbark that had been cut off.  This was spread out, though not quite flat,\r\nstill leaving it somewhat curved.  The convex side, that which had lain\r\ntowards the tree, was now blackened with pulverised charcoal, which\r\nNorman had directed Basil to prepare for the purpose; and to the bark at\r\none end was fastened a stake or shaft.  Nothing more remained but to fix\r\nthis stake in the canoe, in an upright position near the bow, and in\r\nsuch a way that the bottom of the piece of bark would be upon a level\r\nwith the seats, with its hollow side looking forward.  It would thus\r\nform a screen, and prevent those in the canoe from being seen by any\r\ncreature that might be ahead.\r\n\r\nWhen all this had been arranged, Norman shouldered the axe, and again\r\nwalked off into the woods.  This time his object was to obtain a\r\nquantity of \"knots\" of the pitch-pine (_Pinus rigida_), which he knew\r\nwould most likely be found in such a situation.  The tree was soon\r\ndiscovered, and pointed out to Francois, who accompanied him as before.\r\nFrancois saw that it was a tree of about fifty feet in height, and a\r\nfoot in diameter at its base.  Its bark was thick, very dark in the\r\ncolour, and full of cracks or fissures.  Its leaves, or \"needles,\" were\r\nabout three inches long, and grew in threes, each three forming a little\r\nbunch, bound together at its base by a brownish sheath.  These bunches,\r\nin botanical language, are termed \"fasciles.\"  The cones were somewhat\r\nshorter than the leaves, nearly of the shape of eggs, and clustered\r\ntogether in threes and fours.  Francois noticed that the tree was\r\nthickly branched, and therefore there are many knots in the wood.  For\r\nthis reason it is not of much use as timber; but on account of the resin\r\nwhich it contains, it is the best species for firewood; and for that\r\npurpose it is used in all parts of the United States, where it grows.\r\nMost of the _pine-wood_ sold for fuel in the large cities of America is\r\nthe wood of this species.\r\n\r\nFrancois supposed that his companion was about to fell one of the trees.\r\nHe was mistaken, however; Norman had no such intention; he had only\r\nstopped before one to examine it, and make sure that it was the species\r\nhe was in search of.  He was soon satisfied of this, and moved on,\r\ndirecting his eyes along the ground.  Again he stopped; but this time it\r\nwas by a tree that had already fallen--blown down, perhaps, by the wind.\r\nIt was half decayed; but Francois could see that it was one of the same\r\nspecies--the pitch-pine.\r\n\r\nThis was the very thing Norman wanted, and plying his axe, he soon\r\nknocked out a large quantity of the resinous knots.  These he at length\r\ncollected, and putting them into a bag, returned with Francois to the\r\nfire.  He then announced that he had no further preparations to make.\r\n\r\nAll four now sat down to supper, which consisted of dry meat, with\r\nbiscuits and coffee; and, as their appetites were sharpened by their\r\nwater journey, they made a hearty meal of it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had finished eating, the canoe was launched and got\r\nready.  The screen of birch-bark was set up, by lashing its shaft to the\r\nbottom timbers, and also to one of the seats.  Immediately in front of\r\nthis, and out upon the bow, was placed the frying-pan; and this having\r\nbeen secured by being tied at the handle, was filled with dry\r\npine-knots, ready to be kindled at a moment's notice.  These\r\narrangements being made, the hunters only awaited the darkness to set\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of their hunt they would be carried still farther\r\ndown-stream; but as that was the direction in which they were\r\ntravelling, they would only be progressing on their journey, and thus\r\n\"killing two birds with one stone.\"  This was altogether a very pleasant\r\nconsideration; and, having stowed everything snugly in the canoe, they\r\nsat chatting agreeably and waiting for the arrival of night.\r\n\r\nNight came at length, and, as Norman had predicted, it was as \"dark as\r\npitch.\"  Stepping gently into the canoe, and seating themselves in their\r\nrespective places, they pushed out and commenced floating down-stream.\r\nNorman sat near the bow, in order to attend to his torch of pine-knots.\r\nFrancois was next to him, holding his double-barrel, loaded with\r\nbuck-shot, which is the same size as that used for swans, and in England\r\nis even known as \"swan-shot.\"\r\n\r\nNext came Basil with his rifle.  He sat near Francois, just by the\r\nmiddle of the little vessel.  Lucien, who was altogether a man of peace\r\nprinciples, and but little of a shot compared with either of his\r\nbrothers, handled the oar--not to propel the canoe, but merely to guide\r\nit.  In this way the party floated on in silence.\r\n\r\nNorman soon kindled his torch, which now cast its red glare over the\r\nsurface of the river, extending its fiery radii even to the banks on\r\nboth sides of the stream.  The trees that overhung the water seemed\r\ntinged with vermilion, and the rippling wave sparkled like liquid gold.\r\nThe light only extended over a semicircle.  From the manner in which the\r\ntorch was placed, its light did not fall upon the other half of the\r\ncircle, and this, by contrast, appeared even darker than it would\r\notherwise have done.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the plan which Norman had adopted was at once apparent\r\nto all.  Ahead of the canoe the whole river was plainly seen for a\r\ndistance of several hundred yards.  No object larger than a cork could\r\nhave floated on its surface, without being visible to those in the\r\nvessel--much less the great white body of a trumpeter swan.  Astern of\r\nthe canoe, on the other hand, all was pitchy darkness, and any one\r\nlooking at the vessel from a position ahead could have seen nothing but\r\nthe bright torch and the black uniform surface behind it.  As I have\r\nalready stated, the concave side of the bark was towards the blaze, and\r\nthe pan containing the torch being placed close in to the screen, none\r\nof the light could possibly fall upon the forms of those within the\r\ncanoe.  They were therefore invisible to any creature from the front,\r\nwhile they themselves could see everything before them.\r\n\r\nTwo questions yet remained unanswered.  First,--would our hunters find\r\nany swans on the river?  Second,--if they should, would these birds\r\nallow themselves to be approached near enough to be shot at?  The first\r\nquestion Norman, of course, could not answer.  That was a matter beyond\r\nhis knowledge or control.  The swans might or might not appear, but it\r\nwas to be hoped they would.  It was likely enough.  Many had been seen\r\non the preceding day, and why not then?  To the second question, the\r\nyoung Canadian gave a definite reply.  He assured his cousins that, if\r\nmet with, the birds would be easily approached in this manner; he had\r\noften hunted them so.  They would either keep their place, and remain\r\nuntil the light came very near them, or they would move towards it (as\r\nhe had many times known them to do), attracted by curiosity and the\r\nnovelty of the spectacle.  He had hunted deer in the same manner; he had\r\nshot, he said, hundreds of these animals upon the banks of rivers, where\r\nthey had come down to the water to drink, and stood gazing at the light.\r\n\r\nHis cousins could well credit his statements.  They themselves had\r\nhunted deer by torchlight in the woods of Louisiana, where it is termed\r\n\"fire-hunting.\"  They had killed several in this way.  The creatures, as\r\nif held by some fascination, would stand with head erect looking at the\r\ntorch carried by one of the party, while the other took sight between\r\ntheir glancing eyes and fired the deadly bullet.  Remembering this, they\r\ncould easily believe that the swans might act in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nIt was not long until they were convinced of it by actual experience.\r\nAs the canoe rounded a bend in the river, three large white objects\r\nappeared in the \"reach\" before them.  A single glance satisfied all that\r\nthey were swans, though, in the deceptive glare of the torch, they\r\nappeared even larger than swans.  Their long upright necks, however,\r\nconvinced the party they could be nothing else, and the canoe was headed\r\ndirectly for them.\r\n\r\nAs our hunters approached, one of the birds was heard to utter his\r\nstrange trumpet-note, and this he repeated at intervals as they drew\r\nnearer.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard that they sing before death,\" muttered Francois to Basil,\r\nwho sat nearest him.  \"If so, I hope that's the song itself;\" and\r\nFrancois laughed quietly at the joke he had perpetrated.\r\n\r\nBasil also laughed; and Lucien, who had overheard the remark, could not\r\nrestrain himself from joining in the laughter.\r\n\r\n\"I fear not,\" rejoined Basil; \"there is hardly enough music in the note\r\nto call it a song.  They may live to `blow their own trumpet' a long\r\nwhile yet.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark called forth a fresh chorus of laughter, in which all took\r\npart; but it was a very silent kind of laughter, that could not have\r\nbeen heard ten yards off: it might have been termed \"laughing in a\r\nwhisper.\"\r\n\r\nIt soon ended, however, as matters now became serious: they were already\r\nwithin less than two hundred yards of the game, and the greatest caution\r\nhad to be observed.  The gunners had arranged the order of fire: Basil\r\nwas to shoot first, taking steady aim with his rifle at any one of the\r\nbirds; while Francois should fire as soon as he heard the report of his\r\nbrother's gun, taking the remaining swans upon the wing, with one or\r\nboth barrels, as he best might.\r\n\r\nAt length Basil deemed himself near enough, and, levelling his piece,\r\nfired.  The bird threw out its wings, and flattened down upon the water,\r\nalmost without a struggle.  The other two were rising into the air, when\r\n\"crack! crack!\" went the two barrels of Francois' piece, and one of the\r\nswans fell back with a broken wing, and fluttered over the surface of\r\nthe stream.  Basil's had been shot dead, and was taken up easily; but\r\nthe wounded bird was only captured after a long chase with the canoe;\r\nand when overtaken, it struck so fiercely with its remaining wing, that\r\none of the blows inflicted a painful wound on the wrist of Francois.\r\nBoth, however, were at length got safely aboard, and proved to be a male\r\nand female of the largest dimensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\n\"CAST AWAY.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, the reports of the guns must have frightened any other swans\r\nthat were near.  It was not likely they would find any more before going\r\nsome distance farther down the river; so, having stowed away in a safe\r\nplace the two already killed, the hunters paddled rapidly onward.\r\n\r\nThey had hardly gone half a mile farther, when another flock of swans\r\nwas discovered.  These were approached in a similar way, and no less\r\nthan three were obtained--Francois making a remarkable shot, and killing\r\nwith both barrels.  A little farther down, one of the \"hoopers\" was\r\nkilled; and still farther on, another trumpeter; making in all no less\r\nthan seven swans that lay dead in the bottom of the canoe!\r\n\r\nThese seven great birds almost filled the little craft to the gunwales,\r\nand you would think that our \"torch-hunters\" ought to have been content\r\nwith such a spoil; but the hunter is hard to satisfy with game, and but\r\ntoo often inclined to \"spill much more blood\" than is necessary to his\r\nwants.  Our voyageurs, instead of desisting, again set the canoe in\r\nmotion, and continued the hunt.\r\n\r\nA short distance below the place where they had shot the last swan, as\r\nthey were rounding a bend in the river, a loud rushing sounded in their\r\nears; similar to that produced by a cascade or waterfall.  On first\r\nhearing it, they were startled and somewhat alarmed.  It might be a\r\n\"fall,\" thought they.  Norman could not tell: he had never travelled\r\nthis route; he did not know whether there were falls in the Red River or\r\nnot, but he believed not.  In his voyage to the South, he had travelled\r\nby another route; that was, up the Winnipeg River, and through Rainy\r\nLake and the Lake of the Woods to Lake Superior.  This is the usual and\r\nwell-known track followed by the _employes_ of the Hudson's Bay Company;\r\nand Norman had travelled it.\r\n\r\nIn this uncertainty the canoe was brought to a stop, and our voyageurs\r\nremained listening.  The noise made by the water was not very distant,\r\nand sounded like the roaring of \"rapids,\" or the rush of a \"fall.\"  It\r\nwas evidently one or the other; but, after listening to it for a\r\nconsiderable time, all came to the conclusion that the sound did not\r\nproceed from the Red River itself, but from some stream that emptied\r\ninto it upon the right.  With this belief they again put the canoe in\r\nmotion, and glided slowly and cautiously onward.\r\n\r\nTheir conjecture proved to be correct.  As they approached nearer, they\r\nperceived that the noise appeared every moment more and more to their\r\nright; and presently they saw, below them, a rapid current sweeping into\r\nthe Red River from the right bank.  This was easily distinguished by the\r\nwhite froth and bubbles that were carried along upon its surface, and\r\nwhich had evidently been produced by some fall over which the water had\r\nlately passed.  The hunters now rowed fearlessly forward, and in a few\r\nmoments came opposite the _debouchure_ of the tributary stream, when a\r\nconsiderable cascade appeared to their view, not thirty yards from the\r\nRed River itself.  The water foamed and dashed over a series of steps,\r\nand then swept rapidly on, in a frothy current.  They had entered this\r\ncurrent, and were now carried along with increased velocity, so that the\r\noarsmen suspended operations, and drew their paddles within the canoe.\r\n\r\nA flock of swans now drew their attention.  It was the largest flock\r\nthey had yet seen, numbering nearly a score of these noble birds,--a\r\nsight, as Norman informed them, that was exceedingly rare even in the\r\nmost favoured haunts of the swan.  Rarely are more than six or seven\r\nseen together, and oftener only two or three.  A grand _coup_ was\r\ndetermined upon.  Norman took up his own gun, and even Lucien, who\r\nmanaged the stern oar, and guided the craft, also brought his piece--a\r\nvery small rifle--close to his hand, so that he might have a shot as\r\nwell as the others.\r\n\r\nThe canoe was directed in such a manner that, by merely keeping its head\r\ndown the stream, it would float to the spot where the swans were.\r\n\r\nIn a short while they approached very near the great birds, and our\r\nhunters could see them sitting on the water, with upraised necks, gazing\r\nin wonder at the torch.  Whether they sounded their strange note was not\r\nknown, for the \"sough\" of the waterfall still echoed in the ears of the\r\ncanoemen, and they could not hear aught else.\r\n\r\nBasil and Norman fired first, and simultaneously; but the louder\r\ndetonations of Francois' double-barrel, and even the tiny crack of\r\nLucien's rifle, were heard almost the instant after.  Three of the birds\r\nwere killed by the volley, while a fourth, evidently \"winged,\" was seen\r\nto dive, and flutter down-stream.  The others mounted into the air, and\r\ndisappeared in the darkness.\r\n\r\nDuring the time occupied in this manoeuvre, the canoe, no longer guided\r\nby Lucien's oar, had been caught by some eddy in the current, and swept\r\nround stern-foremost.  In this position the light no longer shone upon\r\nthe river ahead, but was thrown up-stream.  All in a downward direction\r\nwas buried in deep darkness.  Before the voyageurs could bring the canoe\r\nback to its proper direction, a new sound fell upon their ears that\r\ncaused some of them to utter a cry of terror.  It was the noise of\r\nrushing water, but not that which they had already heard and passed.  It\r\nwas before them in the river itself.  Perhaps it was a cataract, and\r\n_they were sweeping rapidly to its brink_!\r\n\r\nThe voice of Norman was heard exclaiming, \"Hold with your oars!--the\r\nrapids!--the rapids!\"  At the same time he himself was seen rising up\r\nand stretching forward for an oar.  All was now consternation; and the\r\nmovements of the party naturally consequent upon such a sudden panic\r\nshook the little craft until her gunwales lipped the water.  At the same\r\ntime she had swung round, until the light again showed the stream ahead,\r\nand a horrid sight it was.  Far as the eye could see was a reach of\r\nfoaming rapids.  Dark points of rocks, and huge black boulders, thickly\r\nscattered in the channel, jutted above the surface; and around and\r\nagainst these, the water frothed and hissed furiously.  There was no\r\ncataract, it is true--there is none such in Red River--but for all\r\npurposes of destruction the rapids before them were equally dangerous\r\nand terrible to the eyes of our voyageurs.  They no longer thought of\r\nthe swans.  The dead were permitted to float down unheeded, the wounded\r\nto make its escape.  Their only thought was to stop the canoe before it\r\nshould be carried upon the rapids.\r\n\r\nWith this intent all had taken to the oars, but in spite of every\r\nexertion they soon found that the light craft had got within the\r\ninfluence of the strong current, and was sucked downward more rapidly\r\nthan ever.  Their backward strokes were to no purpose.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds the canoe had passed over the first stage of the\r\nrapids, and shot down with the velocity of an arrow.  A huge boulder lay\r\ndirectly in the middle of the channel, and against this the current\r\nbroke with fury, laving its sides in foaming masses.  The canoe was\r\nhurried to this point; and as the light was again turned up-stream, none\r\nof the voyageurs could see this dangerous rock.  But they could not have\r\nshunned it then.  The boat had escaped from their control, and spun\r\nround at will.  The rock once more came under the light, but just as the\r\ncanoe, with a heavy crash, was driven against it.\r\n\r\nFor some moments the vessel, pressed by the current against the rock,\r\nremained motionless, but her sides were stove in, and the water was\r\nrushing through.  The quick eye of Basil--cool in all crises of extreme\r\ndanger--perceived this at a glance.  He saw that the canoe was a wreck,\r\nand nothing remained but to save themselves as they best might.\r\nDropping the oar, and seizing his rifle, he called to his companions to\r\nleap to the rock: and all together immediately sprang over the gunwale.\r\nThe dog Marengo followed after.\r\n\r\nThe canoe, thus lightened, heeled round into the current, and swept on.\r\nThe next moment she struck another rock, and was carried over on her\r\nbeams.  The water then rushed in--the white bodies of the swans, with\r\nthe robes, blankets, and implements, rose on the wave; the blazing knots\r\nwere spilled from the pan, and fell with a hissing sound: and a few\r\nseconds after they were extinguished, and all was darkness!\r\n\r\nThe Young Voyageurs--by Captain Mayne Reid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nA BRIDGE OF BUCKSKIN.\r\n\r\nThe canoe was lost, and all it had contained, or nearly all.  The\r\nvoyageurs had saved only their guns, knives, and the powder-horns and\r\npouches, that had been attached to their persons.  One other thing had\r\nbeen saved--an axe which Basil had flung upon the rock as he stepped out\r\nof the sinking vessel.  All the rest--robes, blankets, swans, cooking\r\nutensils, bags of provisions, such as coffee, flour, and dried meat--\r\nwere lost--irrecoverably lost.  These had either drifted off upon the\r\nsurface, or been carried under water and hidden among the loose stones\r\nat the bottom.  No matter where, they were lost; and our voyageurs now\r\nstood on a small naked rock in the middle of the stream, with nothing\r\nleft but the clothes upon their backs, and the arms in their hands.\r\nSuch was their condition.\r\n\r\nThere was something so sudden and awful in the mishap that had befallen\r\nthem, that for some minutes they stood upon the spot where they had\r\nsettled without moving or addressing a word to one another.  They gazed\r\nafter the canoe.  They knew that it was wrecked, although they could see\r\nnothing either of it or its contents.  Thick darkness enveloped them,\r\nrendered more intense from the sudden extinction of the torchlight.\r\nThey saw nothing but the foam flickering along the river; like the\r\nghosts of the swans they had killed, and they heard only the roaring of\r\nthe water, that sounded in their ears with a hoarse and melancholy wail.\r\n\r\nFor a long time they stood impressed with the lamentable condition into\r\nwhich the accident had plunged them; and a lamentable condition it was,\r\nsure enough.  They were on a small rock in the midst of a rapid river.\r\nThey were in the midst of a great wilderness too, many long miles from a\r\nsettlement.  The nearest could only be reached by travelling through\r\npathless forests, and over numerous and deep rivers.  Impassable swamps,\r\nand lakes with marshy shores, lay on the route, and barred the direct\r\ncourse, and all this journey would have to be made on foot.\r\n\r\nBut none of our young voyageurs were of that stamp to yield themselves\r\nto despair.  One and all of them had experienced perils before--greater\r\neven than that in which they now stood.  As soon, therefore, as they\r\nbecame fully satisfied that their little vessel was wrecked, and all its\r\ncontents scattered, instead of despairing, their first thoughts were how\r\nto make the best of their situation.\r\n\r\nFor that night, at least, they were helpless.  They could not leave the\r\nrock.  It was surrounded by rapids.  Sharp, jagged points peeped out of\r\nthe water, and between these the current rushed with impetuosity.  In\r\nthe darkness no human being could have crossed to either shore in\r\nsafety.  To attempt it would have been madness, and our voyageurs soon\r\ncame to this conclusion.  They had no other choice than to remain where\r\nthey were until the morning; so, seating themselves upon the rock, they\r\nprepared to pass the night.\r\n\r\nThey sat huddled close together.  They could not lie down--there was not\r\nroom enough for that.  They kept awake most of the night, one or other\r\nof them, overcome by fatigue, occasionally nodding over in a sort of\r\nhalf-sleep, but awakening again after a few minutes' uncomfortable\r\ndreaming.  They talked but little, as the noise of the rushing rapids\r\nrendered conversation painful.  To be heard, they were under the\r\nnecessity of shouting to one another, like passengers in an omnibus.  It\r\nwas cold, too.  None of them had been much wetted in escaping from the\r\ncanoe; but they had saved neither overcoat, blanket, nor buffalo-robe;\r\nand, although it was now late in the spring, the nights near Lake\r\nWinnipeg, even at that season, are chilly.  They were above the latitude\r\nof 50 degrees; and although in England, which is on that parallel, it is\r\nnot very cold of a spring night, it must be remembered that the line of\r\nequal temperature--in the language of meteorologists the \"_isothermal\r\nline_,\"--is of a much lower latitude in America than in Europe.\r\n\r\nAnother fact worth remembering is, that upon the eastern or Atlantic\r\ncoast of the American Continent it is much colder in the same latitude\r\nthan on the western or Pacific side.  The Pacific \"sea-board\" in its\r\nclimate is more like the western edge of the old continent.  This would\r\nseem to indicate that the climate of a coast country is much influenced\r\nby the side upon which the ocean lies, whether east or west.  This in\r\nreality is the case, for you may observe on your map that the western\r\ncoasts of both the \"old world\" and the \"new\" are somewhat similarly\r\nplaced in regard to their oceans, and hence the similarity of their\r\nclimates.\r\n\r\nThere are many other causes connected with this; such as the direction\r\nof winds, and the different effects produced by them on the atmosphere\r\nwhen they have passed over water or over land.  It was, and is still by\r\nmany people believed, that the winds are produced by the air becoming\r\nheated in a particular place, and then ascending, and leaving a \"vacuum\"\r\ninto which the colder air rushes from all sides around.  This \"rushing,\"\r\nit was supposed, made the wind.  To some extent this theory is true, but\r\nthere are several other causes that operate in producing wind.\r\nElectricity--an agent hitherto but little known, but one of the most\r\nimportant elements of our Earth--has much to do with the winds; and the\r\nrevolution of the Earth on its own axis has also an influence upon them.\r\nIndeed it is to be wondered at, that mankind should have so long\r\nremained satisfied with the very unsatisfactory theory of the _heated\r\nair_.  But it is not to be wondered at either, when we consider how\r\nlittle mankind has had to do with these things--when we consider that as\r\nyet nearly every country upon the face of the globe is despotic; that\r\nthe whole time of the great body of the people is occupied in a struggle\r\nfor life--occupied in toiling for a few, who by the most cunning devices\r\nrob them of the fruits of their toils--rob them so skilfully that the\r\npoor blinded masses have grown to consider eternal toil as the _natural\r\nstate of man_--nay more, are ready to persecute him who would elevate\r\nthem, and worship him who would sink them deeper in baseness and\r\nbondage;--when we reflect on this almost hopeless darkness of soul that\r\nhas marked the history of the past, and is too much the character of the\r\npresent, we need not wonder that so few have had either leisure or\r\ninclination to yield themselves to the acquirement or prosecution of\r\nscientific knowledge.  \"The winds have blown where they listed, and we\r\nhave heard the sound thereof,\" but men absorbed in the hard struggle of\r\nlife have found but little time to inquire \"whence they come or whither\r\nthey go.\"\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States are yet but partially free.  They still\r\ninherit, from customs and prejudices, the fruits of an ancestral\r\noppression, and a bondage of centuries of duration.  But even their\r\n_partial_ freedom has already shown its good effects.  At this moment\r\nknowledge is progressing faster among these people than any other on the\r\nface of the earth.  Meteorology begins to assume the palpable shape of\r\nan exact science.  The winds are being traced in their currents, and\r\nfollowed through all their windings, by Maury and other men of talent;\r\nand if you live twenty years longer (and I hope you may live three times\r\nas many years), you will no doubt be able to tell \"whence the wind\r\ncometh and whither it goeth.\"\r\n\r\nWell, we began this politico-scientific discussion by observing that it\r\nwas very cold in the latitude of Lake Winnipeg, even in late spring.\r\nOnly at night though; the days are sometimes so hot there that you might\r\nfancy yourself in the tropics.  These extremes are characteristic of the\r\nclimate of all American countries, and particularly those that lie at a\r\ndistance from the sea-coast.\r\n\r\nOur voyageurs were chilled to the very bones, and of course glad to see\r\nthe daylight glimmering through the tops of the trees that grew upon the\r\nbanks of the river.  As soon as day broke, they began to consider how\r\nthey would reach those trees.  Although swimming a river of that width\r\nwould have been to any of the four a mere bagatelle, they saw that it\r\nwas not to be so easy an affair.  Had they been upon either bank, they\r\ncould have crossed to the other without difficulty--as they would have\r\nchosen a place where the water was comparatively still.  On the rock\r\nthey had no choice, as the rapids extended on both sides above and below\r\nit.  Between the boulders the current rushed so impetuously, that had\r\nthey attempted to swim to either bank, they would have been carried\r\ndownward, and perhaps dashed with violence against one or other of the\r\nsharp stones.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was light, they saw all this; not without feelings of\r\napprehension and uneasiness.  Their whole attention was now occupied\r\nwith the one object--how they should get to the bank of the river.\r\n\r\nThe right bank was the more distant; but the passage in that direction\r\nappeared the easier one.  The current was not so swift, nor yet did it\r\nseem so deep.  They thought they might ford it, and Basil made the\r\nattempt; but he soon got beyond his depth; and was obliged, after being\r\ncarried off his feet, to swim up under the lee of the rock again.\r\n\r\nFrom the rock to the right bank was about an hundred yards' distance.\r\nHere and there, at irregular intervals, sharp, jagged stones rose above\r\nthe surface, some of them projecting three feet or more out of the\r\nwater, and looking _very_ much like upright tombstones.  Lucien had\r\nnoticed these, and expressed the opinion that if they only had a rope,\r\nthey might fling it over one of these stones, and then, holding it fast\r\nat the other end, might pass by that means from one to the other.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was a good one, but where was the rope to come from?  All\r\ntheir ropes and cords--lassoes and all--had been swept away in the\r\nwreck.  Not a string remained, except those that fastened their horns,\r\nflasks, and other accoutrements; and these were only small thongs, and\r\nwould be of no use for such a purpose.  It would require a rope strong\r\nenough to carry the weight of a man impelled by a rapid current--in\r\nfact, a weight equal to that of several men.  They all set to thinking\r\nhow this was to be obtained.  Each looked at the other, and scanned the\r\nstraps and thongs that were around their bodies.  They were satisfied at\r\na glance that these would not be sufficient to make such a rope as was\r\nwanted.  They did not give up the hope of being able to obtain one.\r\nThey were all of them accustomed to resort to strange expedients, and a\r\nsufficiently strange one now suggested itself.  Basil and Norman seemed\r\nto have thought of it at the same time, for both at once unbuckled their\r\nstraps, and commenced pulling off their buckskin hunting-shirts.  The\r\nothers said nothing, as they knew well what they were going to do with\r\nthem--they knew they intended cutting them into strips, and then\r\ntwisting a rope out of them.\r\n\r\nAll four set to work together.  Lucien and Francois held the shirts\r\ntaut, while Basil and Norman handled the knives, and in a few minutes\r\nthe rock was covered with strips of buckskin about two inches wide, by a\r\nyard or so in length.  These were next joined and plaited together in\r\nsuch a manner that a rope was formed nearly forty feet long.  An eye was\r\nmade at one end, and through this the other end was reeved--so that a\r\nrunning noose was obtained, in the same manner as the Mexicans and\r\nIndians make their lassoes.  The rope was now ready for use, and Basil\r\nwas the very hand to use it; for Basil knew how to fling a lasso as well\r\nas either Mexican or Indian.  He had practised it often, and had lassoed\r\nmany a long-horned bull upon the prairies of Opelousas and the\r\nAttakapas.  To Basil, therefore, the rope was given.  He placed himself\r\non the highest part of the rock, having first coiled the new-made lasso,\r\nand hung the coil lightly over his left arm.  He then took the noose-end\r\nin his right hand, and commenced winding it around his head.  His\r\ncompanions had laid themselves flat, so as not to be in the way of the\r\nnoose as it circled about.  After a few turns the rope was launched\r\nforth, and a loud \"hurrah!\" from Francois announced that the throw was\r\nsuccessful.  It was so in fact, as the noose was seen settling smoothly\r\nover the jutting-stone, taking full hold upon it.  A pull from Basil\r\nfixed it; and in a few minutes it was made quite fast, without the\r\nslightest danger of its slipping off.  The other end was then carried\r\nround a projecting point of the rock on which they stood, and knotted\r\nfirmly, so that the rope was quite taut, and stretched in a nearly\r\nhorizontal direction, about a foot above the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nThe voyageurs now prepared to cross over.  Their guns, pouches, and\r\nflasks were carefully secured, so that the water could not damage them.\r\nThen each took a piece of the buckskin thong, and fastened it round his\r\nwaist, leaving enough to form a running loop.  This loop was intended to\r\nembrace the rope, and run along it, as they drew themselves forward by\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\nBasil passed over first.  He was the oldest, and, as he asserted, it was\r\nbut right he should run the risk in testing the new-fashioned bridge, of\r\nwhich he was the architect.  It worked admirably, and sustained the\r\nweight of his body, with the whole force of the current acting upon it.\r\nOf course he was swept far down, and the rope was stretched to its full\r\ntension, but he succeeded in handing himself along, until he was able to\r\ntouch the second rock, and clamber upon it in safety.  During the\r\npassage across he was watched by his companions with emotions of no\r\nordinary character, but as soon as he had reached the opposite end of\r\nthe rope all three uttered a loud and simultaneous cheer.  Lucien passed\r\nover next, and after him Francois.  Notwithstanding his danger, Francois\r\nlaughed loudly all the time he was in the water, while his brothers were\r\nnot without some fears for his safety.  Marengo was next attached to the\r\nrope, and pulled safely over.\r\n\r\nNorman was the last to cross upon the buckskin bridge, but, like the\r\nothers, he landed in safety; and the four, with the dog, now stood upon\r\nthe little isolated boulder, where there was just room enough to give\r\nthem all a footing.\r\n\r\nA difficulty now presented itself, which they had not hitherto thought\r\nof.  Another reach of rapid current was to be crossed, before they could\r\nsafely trust themselves to enter the water.  This they knew before, but\r\nthey had also noticed that there was another jutting rock, upon which\r\nthey might fling their rope.  But the rope itself was now the\r\ndifficulty.  It was fast at both ends, and how were they to release it\r\nfrom the rock they had left?  One of them could easily cross over again\r\nand untie it, but how was he to get back to the others?  Here was a\r\ndilemma which had not presented itself before, and they now saw\r\nthemselves no better off than ever.  The rapid that remained to be\r\ncrossed, was as dangerous as the one they had succeeded in passing.\r\nThere was no hope that they could swim it in safety.  They would\r\ncertainly be swept with violence against the rocks below.  There was no\r\nchance, then, of their going an inch farther--unless by some means\r\nsimilar to that they had just used, and the rope was no longer at their\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nFor some time they all stood silent, each considering the matter in his\r\nown way.  How could they free the rope?\r\n\r\n\"It cannot be done,\" said one.  \"Impossible,\" rejoined another.  \"We\r\nmust make a second rope.  Francois's shirt still remains, and our\r\nleggings--we can use them.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the mode suggested by Francois and Norman, and Lucien seemed to\r\nassent to it.  They had already commenced untying their leggings, when\r\nBasil uttered the ejaculation--\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is it, brother?\" asked Lucien.\r\n\r\n\"I think I can free the rope at the other end.  At all events, let me\r\ntry.  It will not cost much, either in time or trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean to do it, brother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit close, all of you.  Give me room--you shall see presently.\"\r\n\r\nAs directed by Basil, they all cowered closely down, so as to occupy as\r\nlittle space as possible.  Basil, having uncovered the lock of his\r\nrifle--which had been carefully bound up in a piece of deer's bladder--\r\nplaced himself in a firm position, and appeared as if about to fire.\r\nSuch was his intention--for in a few moments he was seen to raise the\r\ngun to his shoulder, and take aim.  None of his companions uttered a\r\nword.  They had already guessed the object of this movement, and sat\r\nsilently awaiting the result.\r\n\r\nOn the rock which they had left, the rope still bound fast passed around\r\none of the angles, in such a way that, from the point where Basil stood,\r\nit offered a fair mark.  It was at this Basil was aiming.  His object\r\nwas to cut the thong with his bullet.  He could not do it with a single\r\nshot, as the thong was broader than the bullet, but he had calculated\r\nthat he might effect his purpose with several.  If he did not succeed in\r\ncutting it clean through, the ball flattening upon the rock would,\r\nperhaps, tear the rope in such a manner that, by pulling by the other\r\nend, they might detach it.  Such were the calculations and hopes of\r\nBasil.\r\n\r\nA moment more and the crack of his rifle was heard.  At the same instant\r\nthe dust rose up from the point at which he had aimed, and several small\r\nfragments flew off into the water.  Again was heard Francois's \"hurrah,\"\r\nfor Francois, as well as the others, had seen that the rope had been hit\r\nat the right place, and now exhibited a mangled appearance.\r\n\r\nWhile Basil was reloading, Norman took aim and fired.  Norman was a good\r\nshot, though perhaps not so good a one as Basil, for that was no easy\r\nmatter, as there were few such marksmen to be found anywhere, not even\r\namong the professional trappers and hunters themselves.  But Norman was\r\na fair shot, and this time hit his mark.  The thong was evidently better\r\nthan half divided by the two; bullets.  Seeing this, Francois took hold\r\nof the other end, and gave it a strong jerk or two, but it was still too\r\nmuch for him, and he ceased pulling, and waited the effect of Basil's\r\nsecond shot.\r\n\r\nThe latter had now reloaded, and, taking deliberate aim again, fired.\r\nThe rope was still held taut upon the rock, for part of it dragged in\r\nthe current, the force of which kept pressing it hard downward.\r\nScarcely was the report heard, when the farther end of the thong flew\r\nfrom its fastening, and, swept by the running water, was seen falling\r\ninto the lee of the boulder on which the party now stood.  A third time\r\nwas heard the voice of Francois uttering one of his customary \"hurrahs.\"\r\nThe rope was now dragged up, and made ready for further use.  Basil\r\nagain took hold of it; and, after coiling it as before, succeeded in\r\nthrowing the noose over the third rock, where it settled and held fast.\r\nThe other end was tied as before, and all passed safely to the new\r\nstation.  Here, however, their labour ended.  They found that from this\r\npoint to the shore the river was shallow, and fordable; and, leaving the\r\nrope where it was, all four took the water, and waded safely to the\r\nbank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nDECOYING THE \"GOATS.\"\r\n\r\nFor the present, then, our voyageurs had escaped.  They were safe upon\r\nthe river's bank; but when we consider the circumstances in which they\r\nwere placed, we shall perceive that they were far from being pleasant\r\nones.  They were in the midst of a wilderness, without either horse or\r\nboat to carry them out of it.  They had lost everything but their arms\r\nand their axe.  The hunting-shirts of some of them, as we have seen,\r\nwere destroyed, and they would now suffer from the severe cold that even\r\nin summer, as we have said, often reigns in these latitudes.  Not a\r\nvessel was left them for cooking with, and not a morsel of meat or\r\nanything was left to be cooked.  For their future subsistence they would\r\nhave to depend upon their guns, which, with their ammunition, they had\r\nfortunately preserved.\r\n\r\nAfter reaching the shore, their first thoughts were about procuring\r\nsomething to eat.  They had now been a long time without food, and all\r\nfour were hungry enough.  As if by one impulse, all cast their eyes\r\naround, and looked upward among the branches of the tree's, to see if\r\nany animal could be discovered that might serve them for a meal.  Bird\r\nor quadruped, it mattered not, so that it was large enough to give the\r\nfour a breakfast.  But neither one nor the other was to be seen,\r\nalthough the woods around had a promising appearance.  The trees were\r\nlarge, and as there was much underwood, consisting of berry-bushes and\r\nplants with edible roots, our voyageurs did not doubt that there would\r\nbe found game in abundance.  It was agreed, then, that Lucien and\r\nFrancois should remain on the spot and kindle a fire, while Basil and\r\nNorman went off in search of something to be cooked upon it.\r\n\r\nIn less than an hour the latter returned, carrying an animal upon his\r\nshoulders, which both the boys recognised as an old acquaintance,--the\r\nprong-horned antelope (_Antilope furcifer_), so called from the single\r\nfork or prong upon its horns.  Norman called it \"a goat,\" and stated\r\nthat this was its name among the fur-traders, while the Canadian\r\nvoyageurs give it the title of \"cabree.\"  Lucien, however, knew the\r\nanimal well.  He knew it was not of the goat kind, but a true antelope,\r\nand the only animal of that genus found in North America.  Its habitat\r\nis the prairie country, and at the present time it is not found farther\r\neast than the prairies extend, nor farther north either, as it is not a\r\ncreature that can bear extreme cold.  In early times, however--that is,\r\nnearly two centuries ago--it must have ranged nearly to the Atlantic\r\nshores, as Father Hennepin in his Travels speaks of \"goats\" being killed\r\nin the neighbourhood of Niagara, meaning no other than the prong-horned\r\nantelopes.  The true wild goat of America is a very different animal,\r\nand is only found in the remote regions of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nWhat Norman had shot, then, was an antelope; and the reason why it is\r\ncalled \"cabree\" by the voyageurs, and \"goat\" by the fur-traders, is\r\npartly from its colour resembling that of the common goat, but more from\r\nthe fact, that along the upper part of its neck there is a standing\r\nmane, which does in truth give it somewhat the appearance of the\r\nEuropean goat.  Another point of resemblance lies in the fact, that the\r\n\"prong-horns\" emit the same disagreeable odour, which is a well-known\r\ncharacteristic of the goat species.  This proceeds from two small\r\nglandular openings that lie at the angles of the jaws, and appear spots\r\nof a blackish brown colour.\r\n\r\nBoth Lucien and Francois had shot antelopes.  They had decoyed them\r\nwithin range in their former expedition on the prairies, and had seen\r\nwolves do the same.  The Indians usually hunt them in this manner, by\r\nholding up some bright-coloured flag, or other curious object, which\r\nrarely fails to bring them within shot; but Norman informed his cousins\r\nthat the Indians of the Hudson's Bay Company care little about the\r\nantelope, and rarely think it worth hunting.  Its skin is of little\r\nvalue to them, and they consider its flesh but indifferent eating.  But\r\nthe chief reason why they take so little notice of it is, because it is\r\nfound in the same range with the buffalo, the moose, and the elk; and,\r\nas all these animals are more valuable to the Indian hunter, he allows\r\nthe antelope to go unmolested, unless when he is hard pressed with\r\nhunger, and none of the others are to be had.\r\n\r\nWhile skinning the antelope for breakfast, Norman amused his companions\r\nby relating how he had killed it.  He said that he had got near enough\r\nto shoot it by practising a \"dodge.\"  After travelling through the woods\r\nfor some half-mile or so, he had come out into a country of \"openings,\"\r\nand saw that there was a large prairie beyond.  He saw that the woods\r\nextended no farther than about a mile from the banks of the river, and\r\nthat the whole country beyond was without timber, except in scattered\r\nclumps.  This is, in fact, true of the Red River country, particularly\r\nof its western part, from which the great prairies stretch westward,\r\neven to the \"foot-hills\" (_piedmont_) of the Rocky Mountains.  Well,\r\nthen, after arriving at the openings, Norman espied a small herd of\r\nantelopes, about ten or a dozen in all.  He would rather they had been\r\nsomething else, as elk or deer; for, like the Indians, he did not much\r\nrelish the \"goat's\" meat.  He was too hungry, however, to be nice, and\r\nso he set about trying to get within shot of the herd.  There was no\r\ncover, and he knew he could not approach near enough without using some\r\nstratagem.  He therefore laid himself flat upon his back, and raised his\r\nheels as high as he could into the air.  These he kicked about in such a\r\nmanner, as soon to attract the attention of the antelopes, that, curious\r\nto make out what it was, commenced running round and round in circles,\r\nof which Norman himself was the centre.  The circles gradually became\r\nsmaller and smaller, until the hunter saw that his game was within\r\nrange; when, slyly rolling himself round on one shoulder, he took aim at\r\na buck, and fired.  The buck fell, and the rest of the herd bounded off\r\nlike the wind.  Norman feeling hungry himself, and knowing that his\r\ncompanions were suffering from the same cause, lost no time in looking\r\nfor other game; but shouldering the \"goat,\" carried it into camp.\r\n\r\nBy this time Lucien and Francois had a fire kindled--a roaring fire of\r\n\"pine-knots\"--and both were standing by it, smoking all over in their\r\nwet leggings.  They had got nearly dry when Norman returned, and they\r\nproceeded to assist in butchering the antelope.  The skin was whipped\r\noff in a trice; and the venison, cut into steaks and ribs, was soon\r\nspitted and sputtering cheerily in the blaze of the pine-knots.\r\nEverything looked pleasant and promising, and it only wanted the\r\npresence of Basil to make them all feel quite happy again.  Basil,\r\nhowever, did not make his appearance; and as they were all as hungry as\r\nwolves, they could not wait for him, but set upon the antelope-venison,\r\nand made each of them a hearty meal from it.\r\n\r\nAs yet they had no apprehensions about Basil.  They supposed he had not\r\nmet with any game, and was still travelling about in search of it.\r\nShould he succeed in killing any, he would bring it in; and should he\r\nnot, he would return in proper time without it.  It was still early in\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nBut several hours passed over, and he did not come.  It was an unusual\r\nlength of time for him to be absent, especially in strange woods of\r\nwhich he knew nothing; moreover, he was in his shirt-sleeves, and the\r\nrest of his clothing had been dripping wet when he set out.  Under these\r\ncircumstances would he remain so long, unless something unpleasant had\r\nhappened to him?\r\n\r\nThis question the three began to ask one another.  They began to grow\r\nuneasy about their absent companion; and as the hours passed on without\r\nhis appearing, their uneasiness increased to serious alarm.  They at\r\nlength resolved to go in search of him.  They took different directions,\r\nso that there would be a better chance of finding him.  Norman struck\r\nout into the woods, while Lucien and Francois, followed by the dog\r\nMarengo, kept down the bank--thinking that if Basil had got lost, he\r\nwould make for the river to guide him, as night approached.  All were to\r\nreturn to the camp at nightfall whether successful or not.\r\n\r\nAfter several hours spent in traversing the woods and openings, Norman\r\ncame back.  He had been unable to find any traces of their missing\r\ncompanion.  The others had got back before him.  They heard his story\r\nwith sorrowing hearts, for neither had they fallen in with the track of\r\nliving creature.  Basil was lost, beyond a doubt.  He would never have\r\nstayed so long, had not some accident happened to him.  Perhaps he was\r\ndead--killed by some wild animal--a panther or a bear.  Perhaps he had\r\nmet with Indians, who had carried him off, or put him to death on the\r\nspot.  Such were the painful conjectures of his companions.\r\n\r\nIt was now night.  All three sat mournfully over the fire, their looks\r\nand gestures betokening the deep dejection they felt.  Although in need\r\nof repose, none of them attempted to go to sleep.  At intervals they\r\ndiscussed the probability of his return, and then they would remain\r\nsilent.  Nothing could be done that night.  They could only await the\r\nmorning light, when they would renew their search, and scour the country\r\nin every direction.\r\n\r\nIt was near midnight, and they were sitting silently around the fire,\r\nwhen Marengo started to his feet, and uttered three or four loud barks.\r\nThe echoes of these had hardly died among the trees when a shrill\r\nwhistle was heard at some distance off in the woods.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Francois, leaping to his feet at the instant; \"that's\r\nBasil's whistle, I'll be bound.  I'd know it a mile off.  Hurrah!\"\r\n\r\nFrancois' \"hurrah!\" rang through the woods, and the next moment came\r\nback a loud \"Hilloa!\" which all recognised as the voice of Basil.\r\n\r\n\"Hilloa!\" shouted the three by the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Hilloa, my boys! all right!\" replied the voice; and a few seconds\r\nafter, the tall upright form of Basil himself was seen advancing, under\r\nthe glare of the pine-knots.  A shout of congratulation was again\r\nraised; and all the party, preceded by Marengo, rushed out to meet the\r\nnew-comer.  They soon returned, bringing Basil up to the fire, when it\r\nwas seen that he had not returned empty-handed.  In one hand he carried\r\na bag of grouse, or \"prairie hens,\" while from the muzzle of his\r\nshouldered rifle there hung something that was at once recognised as a\r\nbrace of buffalo tongues.\r\n\r\n\"_Voila_!\" cried Basil, flinging down the bag, \"how are you off for\r\nsupper?  And here,\" continued he, pointing to the tongues, \"here's a\r\npair of tit-bits that'll make you lick your lips.  Come! let us lose no\r\ntime in the cooking, for I'm hungry enough to eat either of them raw.\"\r\n\r\nBasil's request was instantly complied with.  The fire was raked up,\r\nspits were speedily procured, a tongue and one of the grouse were\r\nroasted; and although Lucien, Francois, and Norman, had already supped\r\non the \"goat's meat,\" they set to upon the new viands with fresh\r\nappetites.  Basil was hungrier than any, for he had been all the while\r\nfasting.  It was not because he was without meat, but because he knew\r\nthat his comrades would be uneasy about him, and he would not stop to\r\ncook it.  Of meat he had enough, since he had slain the two buffaloes to\r\nwhich the tongues had belonged; and these same buffaloes, he now\r\ninformed them, had been the cause of his long absence.\r\n\r\nOf course, all were eager to know how the buffaloes could have delayed\r\nhim; and therefore, while they were discussing their savoury supper,\r\nBasil narrated the details of his day's adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nA \"PARTRIDGE DANCE.\"\r\n\r\n\"After leaving here,\" said Basil, \"I struck off through the woods in a\r\nline that led from the river, in a diagonal direction.  I hadn't walked\r\nmore than three hundred yards, when I heard a drumming sound, which I at\r\nfirst took to be thunder; but, after listening a while, I knew it was\r\nnot that, but the drumming of the ruffed grouse.  As soon as I could\r\nascertain the direction of the sound, I hurried on in that way; but for\r\na long time I appeared to get no nearer it, so greatly does this sound\r\ndeceive one.  I should think I walked a full mile before I arrived at\r\nthe place where the birds were, for there were many of them.  I then had\r\na full view of them, as they went through their singular performances.\r\n\r\n\"There were, in all, about a score.  They had selected a piece of open\r\nand level ground, and over this they were running in a circle, about\r\ntwenty feet in diameter.  They did not all run in the same direction,\r\nbut met and crossed each other, although they never deviated much from\r\nthe circumference of the circle, around which the grass was worn quite\r\nbare, and a ring upon the turf looked baked and black.  When I first got\r\nnear, they heard my foot among the leaves, and I saw that one and all of\r\nthem stopped running, and squatted close down.  I halted, and hid myself\r\nbehind a tree.  After remaining quiet a minute or so, the birds began to\r\nstretch up their necks, and then all rose together to their feet, and\r\ncommenced running round the ring as before.  I knew they were performing\r\nwhat is called the `Partridge Dance;' and as I had never witnessed it I\r\nheld back awhile, and looked on.  Even hungry as I was, and as I knew\r\nall of you to be, so odd were the movements of these creatures, that I\r\ncould not resist watching them a while, before I sent my unwelcome\r\nmessenger into their `ballroom.'  Now and then an old cock would\r\nseparate from the pack, and running out to some distance, would leap\r\nupon a rock that was there; then, after dropping his wings, flirting\r\nwith his spread tail, erecting the ruff upon his neck, and throwing back\r\nhis head, he would swell and strut upon the rock, exhibiting himself\r\nlike a diminutive turkey-cock.  After manoeuvring in this way for a few\r\nmoments, he would commence flapping his wings in short quick strokes,\r\nwhich grew more rapid as he proceeded, until a `booming' sound was\r\nproduced, more like the rumble of distant thunder than anything I can\r\nthink of.\r\n\r\n\"This appeared to be a challenge to the others; and then a second would\r\ncome out, and, after replying to it by putting himself through a similar\r\nseries of attitudes, the two would attack each other, and fight with all\r\nthe fury of a pair of game-cocks.\r\n\r\n\"I could have watched their manoeuvres much longer,\" continued Basil,\r\n\"but hunger got the better of me, and I made ready to fire.  Those that\r\nwere `dancing' moved so quickly round the ring that I could not sight\r\none of them.  If I had had a shot-gun, I might have covered several, but\r\nwith the rifle I could not hope for more than a single bird; so, wanting\r\nto make sure of that, I waited until an old cock mounted the rock, and\r\ngot to `drumming.'  Then I sighted him, and sent my bullet through his\r\ncrop.  I heard the loud whirr of the pack as they rose up from the ring;\r\nand, marking them, I saw that they all alighted only a couple of hundred\r\nyards off, upon a large spruce-tree.  Hoping they would sit there until\r\nI could get another shot, I loaded as quickly as possible, and stepped\r\nforward.  The course I took brought me past the one I had killed, which\r\nI picked up, and thrust hastily into my bag.  Beyond this I had to pass\r\nover some logs that lay along the ground, with level spaces between\r\nthem.  What was my surprise in getting among these, to see two of the\r\ncocks down upon the grass, and righting so desperately that they took no\r\nnotice of my approach!  At first I threw up my rifle, intending to fire,\r\nbut seeing that the birds were within a few feet of me, I thought they\r\nmight let me lay hold of them, which they, in fact, did; for the next\r\nmoment I had `grabbed' both of them, and cooled their bellicose spirits\r\nby wringing their heads off.\r\n\r\n\"I now proceeded to the pack, that still kept the tree.  When near\r\nenough, I sheltered myself behind another tree; and taking aim at one, I\r\nbrought him tumbling to the ground.  The others sat still.  Of course, I\r\nshot the one upon the lowest branch: I knew that, so long as I did this,\r\nthe others would sit until I might get the whole of them; but that if I\r\nshot one of the upper ones, its fluttering down through the branches\r\nwould alarm the rest, and cause them to fly off.  I loaded and fired,\r\nand loaded and fired, until half-a-dozen of the birds lay around the\r\nroot of the tree.  I believe I could have killed the whole pack, but it\r\njust then occurred to me that I was wasting our precious ammunition, and\r\nthat, considering the value of powder and shot to us just now, the birds\r\nwere hardly worth a load apiece; so I left off cracking at them.  As I\r\nstepped forward to gather what I had killed, the rest whirred away into\r\nthe woods.\r\n\r\n\"On reaching the tree where they had perched, I was very much surprised\r\nto find a raw-hide rope neatly coiled up, and hanging from one of the\r\nlower branches.  I knew that somebody must have placed it there, and I\r\nlooked round to see what `sign' there was besides.  My eye fell upon the\r\ncinders of an old fire near the foot of the tree; and I could tell that\r\nsome Indians had made their camp by it.  It must have been a good while\r\nago, as the ashes were beaten into the ground by the rain, and,\r\nmoreover, some young plants were springing up through them.  I\r\nconcluded, therefore, that whoever had camped there had hung the rope\r\nupon the tree, and on leaving the place had forgotten it.  I took the\r\nrope down to examine it: it was no other than a lasso, full fifty feet\r\nlong, with an iron ring neatly whipped into the loop-end; and, on trying\r\nit with a pull, I saw it was in the best condition.  Of course, I was\r\nnot likely to leave such a prize behind me.  I had grown, as you may all\r\nconceive, to have a very great regard for a rope, considering that one\r\nhad just saved all our lives; so I resolved on bringing the lasso with\r\nme.  In order to carry it the more conveniently, I coiled it, and then\r\nhung the coil across my shoulders like a belt.  I next packed my game\r\ninto the bag, which they filled chock up to the mouth, and was turning\r\nto come back to camp, when my eye fell upon an object that caused me\r\nsuddenly to change my intention.\r\n\r\n\"I was near the edge of the woods, and through the trunks I could see a\r\nlarge open space beyond, where there were no trees, or only one here and\r\nthere.  In the middle of this opening there was a cloud of dust, and in\r\nthe thick of it I could see two great dark animals in motion.  They were\r\nrunning about, and now and then coming together with a sudden rush; and\r\nevery time they did so, I could hear a loud thump, like the stroke of a\r\nsledgehammer.  The sun was shining upon the yellow dust-cloud, and the\r\nanimals appeared from this circumstance to be of immense size--much\r\nlarger than they really were.  Had I not known what kind of creatures\r\nwere before me, I should have believed that the mammoths were still in\r\nexistence.  But I knew well what they were: I had seen many before,\r\ncarrying on just such a game.  I knew they were buffalo bulls, engaged\r\nin one of their terrible battles.\"\r\n\r\nHere Basil's narrative was interrupted by a singular incident.  Indeed,\r\nit had been interrupted more than once by strange noises that were heard\r\nat some distance off in the woods.  These noises were not all alike: at\r\none time they resembled the barking of a cur dog; at another, they might\r\nhave been mistaken for the gurglings of a person who was being hanged;\r\nand then would follow a shriek so dreadful that for some time the woods\r\nwould echo with its dismal sound!  After the shriek a laugh would be\r\nheard, but a miserable \"haw-haw-haw!\" unlike the laugh of a sane person.\r\n\r\nAll these strange voices were calculated to inspire terror, and so have\r\nthey many a time, with travellers not accustomed to the solitary woods\r\nof America.  But our young voyageurs were not at all alarmed by them.\r\nThey knew from what sort of a creature they proceeded; they knew they\r\nwere the varying notes of the great horned-owl (_Strix Virginiana_); and\r\nas they had seen and heard many a one before, they paid no heed to this\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nWhile Basil was going on with his relation, the bird had been several\r\ntimes seen to glide past, and circle around upon his noiseless pinions.\r\nSo easy was his flight, that the slightest inclining of his spread tail,\r\nor the bending of his broad wing, seemed sufficient to turn and carry\r\nhim in any direction.  Nothing could be more graceful than his flight,\r\nwhich was not unlike that of the eagle, while he was but little inferior\r\nin size to one of these noble birds.\r\n\r\nWhat interrupted Basil was, that the owl had alighted upon a branch not\r\ntwenty feet from where they were all sitting round the fire, by the\r\nblaze of which they now had a full view of this singular creature.  The\r\nmoment it alighted, it commenced uttering its hideous and unmusical\r\ncries, at the same time going through such a variety of contortions,\r\nboth with its head and body, as to cause the whole party a fit of\r\nlaughter.  It was, in fact, an odd and interesting sight to witness its\r\ngrotesque movements, as it turned first its body, and then its head\r\naround, without moving the shoulders, while its great honey-coloured\r\neyes glared in the light of the fire.  At the end of every attitude and\r\nutterance, it would snap its bill with such violence, that the cracking\r\nof the mandibles upon each other might have been heard to the distance\r\nof several hundred yards.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for Francois' patience to bear, and he immediately\r\ncrept to his gun.  He had got hold of the piece, and cocked it; but,\r\njust as he was about to take aim, the owl dropped silently down from the\r\nbranch, and, gliding gently forward, thrust out its feathered leg, and\r\nlifted one of the grouse in its talons.  The latter had been lying upon\r\nthe top of a fallen tree not six feet from the fire!  The owl, after\r\nclutching it, rose into the air; and the next moment would have been\r\nlost in darkness, but the crack of Francois' rifle put a sudden stop to\r\nits flight, and with the grouse still clinging to its claws it fell\r\nfluttering to the earth.  Marengo jumped forward to seize it; but\r\nMarengo little knew the sort of creature he had to deal with.  It\r\nhappened to be only \"winged,\" and as soon as the dog came near, it threw\r\nitself upon its back, and struck at him with its talons so wickedly,\r\nthat he was fain to approach it with more caution.  It cost Marengo a\r\nconsiderable fight before he succeeded in getting his jaws over it.\r\nDuring the contest it continually snapped its bill, while its great\r\ngoggle eyes kept alternately and quickly opening and closing, and the\r\nfeathers being erected all over its body, gave it the appearance of\r\nbeing twice its real size.  Marengo at length succeeded in \"crunching\"\r\nit--although not until he was well scratched about the snout--and its\r\nuseless carcass having been thrown upon the ground, the dog continued to\r\nworry and chew at it, while Basil went on with his narration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nBASIL AND THE BISON-BULL.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I saw the buffaloes,\" continued Basil, \"my first thought was\r\nto get near, and have a shot at them.  They were worth a charge of\r\npowder and lead, and I reflected that if I could kill but one of them,\r\nit would ensure us against hunger for a couple of weeks to come.  So I\r\nhung my game-bag to the branch of a tree, and set about approaching\r\nthem.  I saw that the wind was in my favour, and there was no danger of\r\ntheir scenting me.  But there was no cover near them--the ground was as\r\nlevel as a table, and there was not a score of trees upon as many acres.\r\nIt was no use crawling up, and I did not attempt it, but walked\r\nstraight forward, treading lightly as I went.  In five minutes, I found\r\nmyself within good shooting range.  Neither of the bulls had noticed me.\r\nThey were too busy with one another, and in all my life I never saw two\r\ncreatures fighting in such earnest.  They were foaming at the mouth, and\r\nthe steam poured out of their nostrils incessantly.  At times, they\r\nwould back from each other like a pair of rams, and then rush together\r\nhead-foremost, until their skulls cracked with the terrible collision.\r\nOne would have fancied that they would break them at every fresh\r\nencounter, but I knew the thickness of a buffalo's skull before that\r\ntime.  I remember having fired a musket at one that stood fronting me\r\nnot more than six feet distant, when, to my surprise, the bullet\r\nflattened and fell to the ground before the nose of the buffalo!  The\r\ncreature was not less astonished than myself, as up to that time it had\r\nnot seen me.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued Basil after a pause, \"I did not stop long to watch the\r\nbattle of the bison-bulls.  I was not curious about that.  I had seen\r\nsuch many a time.  I was thinking about the meat; and I paused just long\r\nenough to select the one that appeared to have the most fat upon his\r\nflanks, when I drew up my rifle and fired.  I aimed for the heart, and\r\nmy aim was a true one, for the animal came to its knees along with the\r\ncrack.  Just at that moment the other was charging upon it, and, to my\r\nsurprise, it continued to run on, until striking the wounded one full\r\nbutt upon the forehead, it knocked the latter right over upon its side;\r\nwhere, after giving half-a-dozen kicks, it lay quite dead.\r\n\r\n\"The remaining bull had dashed some paces beyond the spot, and now\r\nturned round again to renew his attack.  On seeing his antagonist\r\nstretched out and motionless, he seemed to be as much astonished as I\r\nwas.  At first, no doubt, he fancied himself the author of a grand\r\n_coup_, for it was plain that up to this time he had neither noticed my\r\npresence, nor the report of the rifle.  The bellowing noise that both\r\nwere making had drowned the latter; and the dust, together with the long\r\nshaggy tufts that hung over his eyes, had prevented him from seeing\r\nanything more than his rival, with whom he was engaged.  Now that the\r\nother was no longer able to stand before him, and thinking it was\r\nhimself that had done the deed, he tossed up his head and snorted in\r\ntriumph.  At this moment, the matted hair was thrown back from his eyes,\r\nand the dust having somewhat settled away, he sighted me, where I stood\r\nreloading my gun.  I fancied he would take off before I could finish,\r\nand I made all the haste in my power--so much so that I dropped the box\r\nof caps at my feet.  I had taken one out, however, and hurriedly\r\nadjusted it, thinking to myself, as I did so, that the box might lie\r\nwhere it was until I had finished the job.  I brought the piece to my\r\nshoulder, when, to my surprise, the bull, instead of running away, as I\r\nhad expected, set his head, and uttering one of his terrible bellows,\r\ncame rushing towards me.  I fired, but the shot was a random one, and\r\nthough it hit him in the snout, it did not in the least disable him.\r\nInstead of keeping him off, it only seemed to irritate him the more, and\r\nhis fury was now at its height.\r\n\r\n\"I had no time to load again.  He was within a few feet of me when I\r\nfired, and it was with difficulty that, by leaping to one side, I\r\navoided his horns; but I did so, and he passed me with such violence\r\nthat I felt the ground shake under his heavy tread.\r\n\r\n\"He wheeled immediately, and made at me a second time.  I knew that if\r\nhe once touched me I was gone.  His horns were set, and his eyes glared\r\nwith a terrible earnestness.  I rushed towards the body of the buffalo\r\nthat lay near, hoping that this might assist me in avoiding the onset.\r\nIt did so, for, as he dashed forward over it, he became entangled among\r\nthe limbs, and again charged without striking me.  He turned, however,\r\nas quick as thought, and again rushed bellowing upon me.  There was a\r\ntree near at hand.  I had noticed it before, but I could not tell\r\nwhether I should have time to reach it.  I was now somewhat nearer it,\r\nand, fearing that I might not be able to dodge the furious brute any\r\nlonger upon the ground, I struck out for the tree.  You may be sure I\r\ndid my best at running.  I heard the bull coming after, but before he\r\ncould overtake me, I had got to the root of the tree.  It was my\r\nintention, at first, only to take shelter behind the trunk; but when I\r\nhad got there, I noticed that there were some low branches, and catching\r\none of these I swung myself up among them.\r\n\r\n\"The bull passed under me with a rush--almost touching my feet as I hung\r\nby the branch--but I was soon safely lodged in a fork, and out of his\r\nreach.\r\n\r\n\"My next thought was to load my gun, and fire at him from my perch, and,\r\nwith this intention, I commenced loading.  I had no fear but that he\r\nwould give me an opportunity, for he kept round the tree, and at times\r\nattacked the trunk, butting and goring it with his horns, and all the\r\nwhile bellowing furiously.  The tree was a small one, and it shook so,\r\nthat I began to fear it might break down.  I therefore made all the\r\nhaste I could to get in the load, expecting soon to put an end to his\r\nattacks.  I succeeded at length in ramming down the bullet, and was just\r\nturning the gun to put on a cap, when I recollected that the cap-box was\r\nstill lying on the ground where it had fallen!  The sudden attack of the\r\nanimal had prevented me from taking it up.  My caps were all within that\r\nbox, and my gun, loaded though it was, was as useless in my hands as a\r\nbar of iron.  To get at the caps would be quite impossible.  I dared not\r\ndescend from the tree.  The infuriated bull still kept pacing under it,\r\nnow going round and round, and occasionally stopping for a moment and\r\nlooking angrily up.\r\n\r\n\"My situation was anything but a pleasant one.  I began to fear that I\r\nmight not be permitted to escape at all.  The bull seemed to be most\r\npertinacious in his vengeance.  I could have shot him in the back, or\r\nthe neck, or where I liked, if I had only had one cap.  He was within\r\nthree feet of the muzzle of my rifle; but what of that when I could not\r\nget the gun to go off?  After a while I thought of making some tinder\r\npaper, and then trying to `touch off' the piece with it, but a far\r\nbetter plan at that moment came into my head.  While I was fumbling\r\nabout my bullet-pouch to get at my flint and steel, of course my fingers\r\ncame into contact with the lasso which was still hanging around my\r\nshoulders.  It was this that suggested my plan, which was no other than\r\nto _lasso the bull, and tie him to the tree_!\r\n\r\n\"I lost no time in carrying it into execution.  I uncoiled the rope, and\r\nfirst made one end fast to the trunk.  The other was the loop-end, and\r\nreeving it through the ring, I held it in my right hand while I leaned\r\nover and watched my opportunity.  It was not long before a good one\r\noffered.  The bull still continued his angry demonstrations below, and\r\npassed round and round.  It was no new thing for me to fling a lasso,\r\nand at the first pitch I had the satisfaction of seeing the noose pass\r\nover the bison's head, and settle in a proper position behind his horns.\r\nI then gave it a twitch, so as to tighten it, and after that I ran the\r\nrope over a branch, and thus getting `a purchase' upon it, I pulled it\r\nwith all my might.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the bull felt the strange cravat around his neck, he began\r\nto plunge and `rout' with violence, and at length ran furiously out from\r\nthe tree.  But he soon came to the end of his tether; and the quick\r\njerk, which caused the tree itself to crack, brought him to his\r\nhaunches, while the noose tightening on his throat was fast strangling\r\nhim.  But for the thick matted hair it would have done so, but this\r\nsaved him, and he continued to sprawl and struggle at the end of the\r\nrope.  The tree kept on cracking, and as I began to fear that it might\r\ngive way and precipitate me to the ground, I thought it better to slip\r\ndown.  I ran direct to where I had dropped the caps; and, having got\r\nhold of the box, I soon had one upon my gun.  I then stole cautiously\r\nback, and while the bison was hanging himself as fast as he could, I\r\nbrought his struggles to a period by sending a bullet through his ribs.\r\n\r\n\"As it was quite night when I had finished the business, of course I\r\ncould not stay to butcher the bulls.  I knew that you would be wondering\r\nwhat kept me, so I cut out the tongues, and coming by the place where I\r\nhad left the grouse, brought them along.  I left a `scare-wolf' over\r\nboth the bulls, however, and I guess we'll find them all right in the\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nBasil having finished the narration of his day's adventures, fresh fuel\r\nwas heaped on the embers, and a huge fire was built--one that would last\r\nuntil morning.  This was necessary, as none of them had now either\r\nblankets or bedding.  Basil himself and Norman were even in their\r\nshirt-sleeves, and of course their only chance for keeping warmth in\r\ntheir bodies would be to keep up a roaring fire all the night.  This\r\nthey did, and all four laying themselves close together, slept soundly\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHREE CURIOUS TREES.\r\n\r\nNext morning they were awake at an early hour.  There was still enough\r\nof the tongues and grouse left, along with some ribs of the antelope, to\r\nbreakfast the party; and then all four set out to bring the flesh of\r\nBasil's buffaloes into camp.  This they accomplished, after making\r\nseveral journeys.  It was their intention to dry the meat over the fire,\r\nso that it might keep for future use.  For this purpose the flesh was\r\nremoved from the bones, and after being cut into thin slices and strips,\r\nwas hung up on poles at some distance from the blaze.  Nothing more\r\ncould be done, but wait until it became sufficiently parched by the\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nWhile this process was going on our voyageurs collected around the fire,\r\nand entered into a consultation about what was best to be done.  At\r\nfirst they thought of going back to the Red River settlement, and\r\nobtaining another canoe, as well as a fresh stock of provisions and\r\nimplements.  But they all believed that getting back would be a toilsome\r\nand difficult matter.  There was a large lake and several extensive\r\nmarshes on the route, and these would have to be got round, making the\r\njourney a very long one indeed.  It would take them days to perform it\r\non foot, and nothing is more discouraging on a journey than to be forced\r\nby some accident to what is called \"taking the back-track.\"  All of them\r\nacknowledged this, but what else could they do?  It is true there was a\r\npost of the Hudson's Bay Company at the northern end of Lake Winnipeg.\r\nThis post was called Norway House.  How were they to reach that afoot?\r\nTo walk around the borders of the lake would be a distance of more than\r\nfour hundred miles.  There would be numerous rivers to cross, as well as\r\nswamps and pathless forests to be threaded.  Such a journey would occupy\r\na month or more, and at Norway House they would still be as it were only\r\nat the beginning of the great journey on which they had set out.\r\nMoreover, Norway House lay entirely out of their way.  Cumberland\r\nHouse--another trading post upon the River Saskatchewan--was the next\r\npoint where they had intended to rest themselves, after leaving the Red\r\nRiver settlements.  To reach Cumberland House _afoot_ would be equally\r\ndifficult, as it, too, lay at the distance of hundreds of miles, with\r\nlakes, and rivers, and marshes, intervening.  What, then, could they do?\r\n\r\n\"Let us _not_ go back,\" cried Francois, ever ready with a bold advice;\r\n\"let us make a boat, and keep on, say I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!  Francois,\" rejoined Basil, \"it's easy to say `make a boat;' how is\r\nthat to be done, I pray?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what's to hinder us to hew a log, and make a dugout?  We have\r\nstill got the axe, and two hatchets left.\"\r\n\r\nNorman asked what Francois meant by a dugout.  The phrase was new to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"A canoe,\" replied Francois, \"hollowed out of a tree.  They are\r\nsometimes called `dugouts' on the Mississippi, especially when they are\r\nroughly made.  One of them, I think, would carry all four of us well\r\nenough.  Don't you think so, Luce?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" answered the student; \"a large one might: but I fear there\r\nare no trees about here of sufficient size.  We are not among the great\r\ntimber of the Mississippi bottom, you must remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"How large a tree would it require?\" asked Norman, who knew but little\r\nof this kind of craft.\r\n\r\n\"Three feet in diameter, at least,\" replied Lucien; \"and it should be of\r\nthat thickness for a length of nearly twenty feet.  A less one would not\r\ncarry four of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I am sure enough,\" responded Norman, \"that we won't find such\r\ntimber here.  I have seen no tree of that size either yesterday, or\r\nwhile we were out this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" added Basil.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe there's one,\" said Lucien.\r\n\r\n\"If we were in Louisiana,\" rejoined Francois, \"I could find fifty\r\ncanoe-trees by walking as many yards.  Why, I never saw such\r\ninsignificant timber as this here.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll see smaller timber than this, Cousin Frank, before we reach the\r\nend of our voyage.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark was made by Norman, who knew that, as they proceeded\r\nnorthward, the trees would be found decreasing in size until they would\r\nappear like garden shrubbery.\r\n\r\n\"But come,\" continued he, \"if we can't build a craft to carry us from\r\n_one_ tree, perhaps we can do it out of _three_.\"\r\n\r\n\"With three!\" echoed Francois.  \"I should like to see a canoe made from\r\nthree trees!  Is it a raft you mean, Cousin Norman?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" responded the other; \"a canoe, and one that will serve us for the\r\nrest of our voyage.\"\r\n\r\nAll three--Basil, Lucien, and Francois--looked to their cousin for an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\"You would rather not go back up the river?\" he inquired, glancing from\r\none to the other.\r\n\r\n\"We wish to go on--all of us,\" answered Basil, speaking for his brothers\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" assented the young fur-trader; \"I think it is better as you\r\nwish it.  Out of these trees I can build a boat that will carry us.  It\r\nwill take us some days to do it, and some time to find the timber, but I\r\nam tolerably certain it is to be found in these woods.  To do the job\r\nproperly I want three kinds; two of them I can see from where I sit; the\r\nthird I expect will be got in the hills we saw this morning.\"\r\n\r\nAs Norman spoke he pointed to two trees that grew among many others not\r\nfar from the spot.  These trees were of very different kinds, as was\r\neasily told by their leaves and bark.  The nearer and more conspicuous\r\nof them at once excited the curiosity of the three Southerners.  Lucien\r\nrecognised it from its botanical description.  Even Basil and Francois,\r\nthough they had never seen it, as it is not to be found in the hot clime\r\nof Louisiana, knew it from the accounts given of it by travellers.  The\r\ntree was the celebrated \"canoe-birch,\" or, as Lucien named it,\r\n\"paper-birch\" (_Betula papyracea_), celebrated as the tree out of whose\r\nbark those beautiful canoes are made that carry thousands of Indians\r\nover the interior lakes and rivers of North America; out of whose bark\r\nwhole tribes of these people fashion their bowls, their pails, and their\r\nbaskets; with which they cover their tents, and from which they even\r\nmake their soup-kettles and boiling-pots!  This, then, was the\r\ncanoe-birch-tree, so much talked of, and so valuable to the poor Indians\r\nwho inhabit the cold regions where it grows.\r\n\r\nOur young Southerners contemplated the tree with feelings of interest\r\nand curiosity.  They saw that it was about sixty feet high, and somewhat\r\nmore than a foot in diameter.  Its leaves were nearly cordate, or\r\nheart-shaped, and of a very dark-green colour; but that which rendered\r\nit most conspicuous among the other trees of the forest was the shining\r\nwhite or silver-coloured bark that covered its trunk, and its numerous\r\nslender branches.  This bark is only white externally.  When you have\r\ncut through the epidermis you find it of a reddish tinge, very thick,\r\nand capable of being divided into several layers.  The wood of the tree\r\nmakes excellent fuel, and is also often used for articles of furniture.\r\nIt has a close, shining grain, and is strong enough for ordinary\r\nimplements; but if exposed to the weather will decay rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe \"canoe-birch\" is not the only species of these trees found in North\r\nAmerica.  The genus _Betula_ (so called from the Celtic word _batu_,\r\nwhich means birch) has at least half-a-dozen other known representatives\r\nin these parts.  There is the \"white birch\" (_Betula populifolia_), a\r\nworthless tree of some twenty feet in height, and less than six inches\r\ndiameter.  The bark of this species is useless, and its wood, which is\r\nsoft and white, is unfit even for fuel.  It grows, however, in the\r\npoorest soil.  Next there is a species called the \"cherry-birch\"\r\n(_Betula lento_), so named from the resemblance of its bark to the\r\ncommon cherry-tree.  It is also called \"sweet birch,\" because its young\r\ntwigs, when crushed, give out a pleasant aromatic odour.  Sometimes the\r\nname of \"black birch\" is given to this species.  It is a tree of fifty\r\nor sixty feet in height, and its wood is much used in cabinet-work, as\r\nit is close-grained, of a beautiful reddish colour, and susceptible of a\r\nhigh polish.\r\n\r\nThe \"yellow birch\" is a tree of the same size, and is so called from the\r\ncolour of its epidermis.  It is likewise used in cabinet-work, though it\r\nis not considered equal in quality to the cherry-birch.  Its leaves and\r\ntwigs have also an aromatic smell when bruised, not so strong, however,\r\nas the last-mentioned.  The wood makes excellent fuel, and is much used\r\nfor that purpose in some of the large cities of America.  The bark, too,\r\nis excellent for tanning--almost equal to that of the oak.\r\n\r\nThe \"red birch\" is still another species, which takes its name from the\r\nreddish hue of its bark.  This is equal in size to the canoe-birch,\r\noften growing seventy feet high, with a trunk of nearly three feet\r\ndiameter.  Its branches are long, slender, and pendulous; and it is from\r\nthe twigs of this species that most of the \"birch-brooms\" used in\r\nAmerica are made.\r\n\r\nStill another species of American birches is the \"dwarf birch\" (_Betula\r\nnana_), so called from its diminutive size, which is that of a shrub,\r\nonly eighteen inches or two feet in height.  It usually grows in very\r\ncold or mountainous regions, and is the smallest of these interesting\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThis information regarding the birches of America was given by Lucien to\r\nhis brothers, not at that time, but shortly afterward, when the three\r\nwere engaged in felling one of these trees.  Just then other matters\r\noccupied them, and they had only glanced, first at the canoe-birch and\r\nthen at the other tree which Norman had pointed out.  The latter was of\r\na different genus.  It belonged to the order _Coniferae_, or\r\ncone-bearing trees, as was evident from the cone-shaped fruits that hung\r\nupon its branches, as well as from its needle-like evergreen leaves.\r\n\r\nThe cone-bearing trees of America are divided by botanists into three\r\ngreat sub-orders--the _Pines_, the _Cypresses_, and the _Yews_.  Each of\r\nthese includes several genera.  By the \"pine tribe\" is meant all those\r\ntrees known commonly by the names pine, spruce, fir, and larch; while\r\nthe _Cupressinae_, or cypress tribe, are the cypress proper, the cedars,\r\nthe arbour-vitae, and the junipers.  The yew tribe has fewer genera or\r\nspecies; but the trees in America known as yews and hemlocks--of which\r\nthere are several varieties--belong to it.\r\n\r\nOf the pine tribe a great number of species exist throughout the North\r\nAmerican Continent.  The late explorations on the western slope of the\r\nRocky Mountains, and in the countries bordering on the Pacific, have\r\nbrought to light a score of species hitherto unknown to the botanist.\r\nMany of these are trees of a singular and valuable kind.  Several\r\nspecies found in the mountains of North Mexico, and throughout those\r\ndesert regions where hardly any other vegetation exists, have edible\r\nseeds upon which whole tribes of Indians subsist for many months in the\r\nyear.  The Spanish Americans call them _pinon_ trees, but there are\r\nseveral species of them in different districts.  The Indians parch the\r\nseeds, and sometimes pound them into a coarse meal, from which they bake\r\na very palatable bread.  This bread is often rendered more savoury by\r\nmixing the meal with dried \"prairie crickets,\" a species of coleopterous\r\ninsects--that is, insects with a crustaceous or shell-like covering over\r\ntheir wings--which are common in the desert wilds where these Indians\r\ndwell.  Some prairie travellers have pronounced this singular mixture\r\nequal to the \"best pound-cake.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Lambert pine,\" so called from the botanist of that name, is found\r\nin Oregon and California, and may be justly considered one of the\r\nwonders of the world.  Three hundred feet is not an uncommon height for\r\nthis vegetable giant; and its cones have been seen of eighteen inches in\r\nlength, hanging like sugar-loaves from its high branches!  The wonderful\r\n\"palo Colorado\" of California is another giant of the pine tribe.  It\r\nalso grows above three hundred feet high, with a diameter of sixteen\r\nfeet!  Then there is the \"red pine,\" of eighty feet high, much used for\r\nthe decks and masts of ships; the \"pitch-pine\" (_Pinus rigida_), a\r\nsmaller tree, esteemed for its fuel, and furnishing most of the firewood\r\nused in some of the American cities.  From this species the strong\r\nburning \"knots\" are obtained.  There is the \"white pine\" (_Pinus\r\nstrobus_), valuable for its timber.  This is one of the largest and best\r\nknown of the pines.  It often attains a height of an hundred and fifty\r\nfeet, and a large proportion of those planks so well-known to the\r\ncarpenter are sawed from its trunk.  In the State of New York alone no\r\nless than 700,000,000 feet of timber are annually obtained from trees of\r\nthis species, which, by calculation, must exhaust every year the\r\nenormous amount of 70,000 acres of forest!  Of course, at this rate the\r\npine-forests of New York State must soon be entirely destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is the \"yellow pine,\" a tree of sixty feet high, much\r\nused in flooring houses; and the beautiful \"balsam fir,\" used as an\r\nornamental evergreen both in Europe and America, and from which is\r\nobtained the well-known medicine--the \"Canada balsam.\"  This tree, in\r\nfavourable situations, attains the height of sixty feet; while upon the\r\ncold summits of mountains it is often seen rising only a few inches from\r\nthe surface.  The \"hemlock spruce\" (_Pinus Canadensis_), is another\r\nspecies, the bark of which is used in tanning.  It is inferior to the\r\noak, though the leather made by it is of excellent quality.  The \"black\"\r\nor \"double spruce\" (_Pinus nigra_), is that species from the twigs of\r\nwhich is extracted the essence that gives its peculiar flavour to the\r\nwell-known \"_spruce beer_.\"  Besides these, at least a dozen new species\r\nhave lately been discovered on the interior mountains of Mexico--all of\r\nthem more or less possessing valuable properties.\r\n\r\nThe pines cannot be termed trees of the tropics, yet do they grow in\r\nsouthern and warm countries.  In the Carolinas, tar and turpentine,\r\nproducts of the pine, are two staple articles of exportation; and even\r\nunder the equator itself, the high mountains are covered with\r\npine-forests.  But the pine is more especially the tree of a northern\r\n_sylva_.  As you approach the Arctic circle, it becomes the\r\ncharacteristic tree.  There it appears in extensive forests, lending\r\ntheir picturesque shelter to the snowy desolation of the earth.  One\r\nspecies of pine is the very last tree that disappears as the traveller,\r\nin approaching the pole, takes his leave of the limits of vegetation.\r\nThis species is the \"white spruce\" (_Pinus alba_), the very one which,\r\nalong with the birch-tree, had been pointed out by Norman to his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nIt was a tree not over thirty or forty feet high, with a trunk of less\r\nthan a foot in thickness, and of a brownish colour.  Its leaves or\r\n\"needles\" were about an inch in length, very slender and acute, and of a\r\nbluish green tint.  The cones upon it, which at that season were young,\r\nwere of a pale green.  When ripe, however, they become rusty-brown, and\r\nare nearly two inches in length.\r\n\r\nWhat use Norman would make of this tree in building his canoe, neither\r\nBasil nor Francois knew.  Lucien only guessed at it.  Francois asked the\r\nquestion, by saying that he supposed the \"timbers\" were to come out of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Norman, \"for that I want still another sort.  If I can't find\r\nthat sort, however, I can manage to do without it, but not so well.\"\r\n\r\n\"What other sort?\" demanded Francois.\r\n\r\n\"I want some cedar-wood,\" replied the other.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that's for the timbers,\" said Francois; \"I am sure of it.  The\r\ncedar-wood is lighter than any other, and, I dare say, would answer\r\nadmirably for ribs and other timbers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right this time, Frank--it is considered the best for that\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think there are cedar-trees on the hills we saw this morning?\" said\r\nFrancois, addressing his Canadian cousin.\r\n\r\n\"I think so.  I noticed something like them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I, too, observed a dark foliage,\" said Lucien, \"which looked like\r\nthe cedar.  If anywhere in this neighbourhood, we shall find them there.\r\nThey usually grow upon rocky, sterile hills, such as those appear to\r\nbe--that is their proper situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"The question,\" remarked Basil, \"ought to be settled at once.  We have\r\nmade up our mind to the building of a canoe, and I think we should lose\r\nno time in getting ready the materials.  Suppose we all set out for the\r\nhills.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed--agreed!\" shouted the others with one voice; and then\r\nshouldering their guns, and taking the axe along, all four set out for\r\nthe hills.  On reaching these, the object of their search was at once\r\ndiscovered.  The tops of all the hills--dry, barren ridges they were--\r\nwere covered with a thick grove of the red cedar (_Juniperus\r\nviginiana_).  The trees were easily distinguished by the numerous\r\nbranches spreading horizontally, and thickly covered with short\r\ndark-green needles, giving them that sombre, shady appearance, that\r\nmakes them the favourite haunt of many species of owls.  Their beautiful\r\nreddish wood was well-known to all the party, as it is to almost every\r\none in the civilised world.  Everybody who has seen or used a black-lead\r\npencil must know what the wood of the red cedar is like--for it is in\r\nthis the black-lead is usually incased.  In all parts of America, where\r\nthis tree grows in plenty, it is employed for posts and fence-rails, as\r\nit is one of the most durable woods in existence.  It is a great\r\nfavourite also for kindling fires, as it catches quickly, and blazes up\r\nin a few seconds, so as to ignite the heavier logs of other timbers,\r\nsuch as the oak and the pine.\r\n\r\nThe red cedar usually attains a height of about thirty to forty feet,\r\nbut in favourable situations it grows still larger.  The soil which it\r\nloves best is of a stony, and often sterile character, and dry barren\r\nhill-tops are frequently covered with cedars, while the more moist and\r\nfertile valleys between possess a _sylva_ of a far different character.\r\nThere is a variety of the red cedar, which trails upon the ground like a\r\ncreeping plant, its branches even taking root again.  This is rather a\r\nsmall bush than a tree, and is often seen hanging down the face of\r\ninaccessible cliffs.  It is known among botanists as the _Juniperus\r\nprostrata_.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Norman, after examining a few of the cedar-trees, \"we have\r\nhere all that's wanted to make our canoe.  We need lose no more time,\r\nbut go to work at once!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied the three brothers, \"we are ready to assist you,--\r\ntell us what to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place,\" said the other, \"I think we had better change our\r\ncamp to this spot, as I see all the different kinds of trees here, and\r\nmuch better ones than those near the river.  There,\" continued he,\r\npointing to a piece of moist ground in the valley,--\"there are some\r\njourneys if we go back and bring our meat to this place at once.\"\r\n\r\nTo this they all of course agreed, and started back to their first camp.\r\nThey soon returned with the meat and other things, and having chosen a\r\nclean spot under a large-spreading cedar-tree, they kindled a new fire\r\nand made their camp by it--that is, they strung up the provisions, hung\r\ntheir horns and pouches upon the branches around, and rested their guns\r\nagainst the trees.  They had no tent to pitch, but that is not necessary\r\nto constitute a camp.  In the phraseology of the American hunter,\r\nwherever you kindle your fire or spend the night is a \"camp.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUILD A BARK CANOE.\r\n\r\nNorman expected that they would be able to finish the canoe in about a\r\nweek.  Of course, the sooner the better, and no time was lost in setting\r\nabout it.  The ribs or \"timbers\" were the first thing to be fashioned,\r\nand a number of straight branches of cedar were cut, out of which they\r\nwere to be made.  These branches were cleared of twigs, and rendered of\r\nan equal thickness at both ends.  They were then flattened with the\r\nknife; and, by means of a little sweating in the ashes, were bent so as\r\nto bear some resemblance in shape to the wooden ox-yokes commonly used\r\nin America, or indeed to the letter U.  The ribs when thus bent were not\r\nall of the same width.  On the contrary, those which were intended to be\r\nplaced near the middle or gangway of the vessel, were about two feet\r\nacross from side to side, while the space between the sides of the\r\nothers was gradually less in each fresh pair, according as their\r\nposition was to be near to the stem and stern.  When the whole of them\r\nhad been forced into the proper shape, they were placed, one inside the\r\nother after the manner of dishes, and then all were firmly lashed\r\ntogether, and left to dry.  When the lashing should be removed, they\r\nwould hold to the form thus given them, and would be ready for fastening\r\nto the kelson.\r\n\r\nWhile Norman was occupied with the timbers the others were not idle.\r\nBasil had cut down several of the largest and straightest birches, and\r\nLucien employed himself in carefully removing the bark and cleansing it\r\nof nodules and other inequalities.  The broad sheets were suspended by a\r\nsmoke fire, so as completely to dry up the sap, and render it tough and\r\nelastic.  Francois had his part to play, and that was to collect the\r\nresinous gum which was distilled, in plenty from the trunks of the\r\nepinette or spruce-trees.  This gum is a species of pitch, and is one of\r\nthe most necessary materials in the making of a bark canoe.  It is used\r\nfor \"paying\" the seams, as well as any cracks that may show themselves\r\nin the bark itself; and without it, or some similar substance, it would\r\nbe difficult to make one of these little vessels watertight.  But that\r\nis not the only thing for which the epinette is valued in\r\ncanoe-building; far from it.  This tree produces another indispensable\r\nmaterial; its long fibrous roots when split, form the twine-like threads\r\nby which the pieces of bark are sewed to each other and fastened to the\r\ntimbers.  These threads are as strong as the best cords of hemp, and are\r\nknown among the Indians by the name of \"watap.\"  In a country,\r\ntherefore, where hemp and flax cannot be readily procured, the \"watap\"\r\nis of great value.  You may say that deer are plenty, and that thongs of\r\nbuckskin would serve the same purpose.  This, however, is not the case.\r\nThe buckskin would never do for such a use.  The moment it becomes wet\r\nit is liable to stretch, so that the seams would open and the canoe get\r\nfilled with water.  The watap, wet or dry, does not yield, and has\r\ntherefore been found to be the best thing of all others for this\r\npurpose.  The only parts now wanted were the gunwale and the bottom.\r\nThe former was easily obtained.  Two long poles, each twenty feet in\r\nlength, were bent somewhat like a pair of bows, and then placed with\r\ntheir concave sides towards each other, and firmly lashed together at\r\nthe ends.  This was the gunwale.  The bottom was the most difficult part\r\nof all.  For that a solid plank was required, and they had no saw.  The\r\naxe and the hatchet, however, were called into requisition, and a log\r\nwas soon hewn and thinned down to the proper dimensions.  It was\r\nsharpened off at the ends, so as to run to a very acute angle, both at\r\nthe stem and stern.  When the bottom was considered sufficiently\r\npolished, and modelled to the right shape, the most difficult part of\r\nthe undertaking was supposed to be accomplished.  A few long poles were\r\ncut and trimmed flat.  These were to be laid longitudinally between the\r\nribs and the bark, somewhat after the fashion of laths in the roofing of\r\na house.  Their use was to prevent the bark from splitting.  The\r\nmaterials were now all obtained complete, and, with a few days' smoking\r\nand drying, would be ready for putting together.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the timbers to dry, paddles were made, and Norman,\r\nwith the help of the others, prepared what he jokingly called his\r\n\"dock,\" and also his \"ship-yard.\"  This was neither more nor less than a\r\nlong mound of earth--not unlike a new-made grave, only three times the\r\nlength of one, or even longer.  It was flat upon the top, and graded\r\nwith earth so as to be quite level and free from inequalities.\r\n\r\nAt length all the materials were considered quite ready for use, and\r\nNorman went to work to put them together.\r\n\r\nHis first operation was to untie the bundle of timbers, and separate\r\nthem.  They were found to have taken the exact form into which they had\r\nbeen bent, and the thongs being no longer necessary to keep them in\r\nplace, were removed.  The timbers themselves were next placed upon the\r\nbottom or kelson, those with the widest bottoms being nearer to\r\n\"midships,\" while those with the narrower bend were set towards the\r\nnarrower ends of the plank.  Thus placed, they were all firmly lashed\r\nwith strong cords of watap, by means of holes pierced in the bottom\r\nplank.  Fortunately Lucien happened to have a pocket-knife, in which\r\nthere was a good awl or piercer, that enabled them to make these holes--\r\nelse the matter would have been a much more difficult one, as an awl is\r\none of the most essential tools in the construction of a bark canoe.  Of\r\ncourse it took Norman a considerable time to set all the ribs in their\r\nproper places, and fasten them securely; but he was ably assisted by\r\nFrancois, who waited upon him with much diligence, handing him now the\r\nawl, and then the watap, whenever he required them.\r\n\r\nNorman's next operation was the laying of his kelson \"in dock.\"  The\r\ntimbers being attached to it, it was lifted up on the earthen mound,\r\nwhere it reached quite from end to end.  Half-a-dozen large heavy stones\r\nwere then placed upon it, so that, pressed down by these upon the even\r\nsurface of the mould, it was rendered quite firm; and, moreover, was of\r\nsuch a height from the ground that the young shipwright could work upon\r\nit without too much bending and kneeling.\r\n\r\nThe gunwale, already prepared, was next placed so as to touch the ends\r\nof the ribs all round, and these ends were adjusted to it with great\r\nnicety, and firmly joined.  Strong cross-pieces were fixed, which were\r\ndesigned, not only to keep the gunwale from spreading or contracting,\r\nbut afterwards to serve as seats.\r\n\r\nOf course the gunwale formed the complete mouth, or upper edge of the\r\ncanoe.  It was several feet longer than the bottom plank, and, when in\r\nplace, projected beyond the ribs at both ends.  From each end of the\r\nbottom plank, therefore, to the corresponding end of the gunwale, a\r\nstraight piece of wood was stretched, and fastened.  One of these pieces\r\nwould form the stem or cutwater, while the other would become the stern\r\nof the craft.  The long poles were next laid longitudinally upon the\r\nribs outside, and lashed in their places; and this done, the skeleton\r\nwas completed, ready for the bark.\r\n\r\nThe latter had been already cut to the proper dimensions and shape.  It\r\nconsisted of oblong pieces--each piece being a regular parallelogram, as\r\nit had been stripped from the tree.  These were laid upon the ribs\r\nlongitudinally, and then sewed to the edge of the bottom plank, and also\r\nto the gunwale.  The bark itself was in such broad pieces that two of\r\nthem were sufficient to cover half a side, so that but one seam was\r\nrequired lengthwise, in addition to the fastenings at the top and\r\nbottom.  Two lengths of the bark also reached cleverly from stem to\r\nstern, and thus required only one transverse seam on each side.  There\r\nwas an advantage in this arrangement, for where the birch-bark can only\r\nbe obtained in small flakes, a great number of seams is a necessary\r\nconsequence, and then it is extremely difficult to keep the canoe from\r\nleaking.  Thanks to the fine birch-trees, that grew in abundance around,\r\nour boat-builders had procured the very best bark.\r\n\r\nThe canoe was now completed all but the \"paying,\" and that would not\r\ntake long to do.  The gum of the epinette had to be boiled, and mixed\r\nwith a little grease, so as to form a species of wax.  For this the fat\r\nalready obtained from the buffaloes was the very thing; and a small tin\r\ncup which Basil had saved from the wreck (it had been strung to his\r\nbullet-pouch), enabled them to melt the gum, and apply it hot.  In less\r\nthan an hour the thing was done.  Every crack and awl-hole was payed,\r\nand the canoe was pronounced \"watertight,\" and, as Francois added, with\r\na laugh, \"seaworthy.\"\r\n\r\nA small pond was near, at the bottom of the hill: Francois espied it.\r\n\r\n\"Come, boys,\" cried he, \"a launch! a launch!\"\r\n\r\nThis was agreed to by all.  The great stones were taken out.  Basil and\r\nNorman, going one to the stem the other to the stern, lifted the canoe\r\nfrom the \"dock,\" and, raising it upon their shoulders, carried it down\r\nto the pond.  The next moment it was pushed into the water, where it\r\nfloated like a cork.  A loud cheer was given, in which even Marengo\r\njoined; and a salute was then fired--a full broadside--from the four\r\nguns.  Francois, to complete the thing, seized one of the paddles, and\r\nleaping into the canoe, shot the little craft out upon the bosom of the\r\npond, cheering all the while like one frantic.  After amusing himself\r\nfor some minutes, he paddled back to the shore, when they all looked\r\neagerly into the canoe, and perceived to their gratification that not as\r\nmuch as a drop of water had leaked during the \"trip.\"  Thanks and\r\ncongratulations now greeted Norman from every side; and, taking their\r\nvessel from the water, the young voyageurs returned to their camp, to\r\nregale themselves with a grand dinner, which Lucien had cooked for the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE CHAIN OF LAKES.\r\n\r\nOur young voyageurs now prepared to resume their journey.  While Norman\r\nwas engaged in building his canoe, with his assistant, Francois, the\r\nothers had not been idle.  Basil was, of course, the hunter of the\r\nparty; and, in addition to the small game, such as hares, geese, and\r\ngrouse, he had killed three caribou, of the large variety known as\r\n\"woodland caribou.\"  These are a species of the reindeer (_Cervus\r\ntarandus_), of which I have more to say hereafter.  Lucien had attended\r\nto the drying of their flesh; and there was enough of it still left, as\r\nour voyageurs believed, to supply their wants until they should reach\r\nCumberland House, where they would, of course, procure a fresh stock of\r\nprovisions.  The skins of the caribou had also been scraped and dressed\r\nby Lucien--who understood the process well--and these, with the skin of\r\nthe antelope, were sufficient to make a pair of hunting-shirts for Basil\r\nand Norman, who, it will be remembered, had lost theirs by cutting them\r\nup.\r\n\r\nNext morning the canoe was launched upon the river--below the rapids--\r\nand the dried meat, with their other matters, snugly stowed in the\r\nstern.  Then the young voyageurs got in, and, seating themselves in\r\ntheir places, seized hold of the paddles.  The next moment the canoe\r\nshot out into the stream; and a triumphant cheer from the crew announced\r\nthat they had recommenced their journey.  They found to their delight\r\nthat the little vessel behaved admirably,--shooting through the water\r\nlike an arrow, and leaking not water enough, as Francois expressed it,\r\n\"to drown a mosquito.\"  They had all taken their seats in the order\r\nwhich had been agreed upon for the day.  Norman was \"bowsman,\" and, of\r\ncourse, sate in the bow.  This, among the regular Canadian voyageurs, is\r\nesteemed the post of honour, and the bowsman is usually styled \"Captain\"\r\nby the rest of the crew.  It is also the post that requires the greatest\r\namount of skill on the part of its occupant, particularly where there\r\nare rapids or shoals to be avoided.  The post of \"steersman\" is also one\r\nof honour and importance; and both steersman and bowsman receive higher\r\nwages than the other voyageurs, who pass under the name of \"middlemen.\"\r\nThe steersman sits in the stern, and that place was now occupied by\r\nLucien, who had proved himself an excellent steersman.  Basil and\r\nFrancois were, of course, the \"middlemen,\" and plied the paddles.  This\r\nwas the arrangement made for the day; but although on other days the\r\nprogramme was to be changed, so as to relieve Basil and Francois, on all\r\noccasions when there were rapids or other difficulties to be encountered\r\nthey were to return to this order.  Norman, of course, understood canoe\r\nnavigation better than his Southern cousins; and therefore, by universal\r\nassent, he was acknowledged \"the Captain,\" and Francois always addressed\r\nhim as such.  Lucien's claim to the post of second honour was admitted\r\nto be just, as he had proved himself capable of filling it to the\r\nsatisfaction of all.  Marengo had no post, but lay quietly upon the\r\nbuffalo skin between Lucien's legs, and listened to the conversation\r\nwithout joining in it, or in any way interfering in the working of the\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours our voyageurs had passed through the low marshy country\r\nthat lies around the mouth of the Red River, and the white expanse of\r\nthe great Lake Winnipeg opened before them, stretching northward far\r\nbeyond the range of their vision.  Norman knew the lake, having crossed\r\nit before, but its aspect somewhat disappointed the Southern travellers.\r\nInstead of a vast dark lake which they had expected to see, they looked\r\nupon a whitish muddy sheet, that presented but few attractive points to\r\nthe eye, either in the hue of its water or the scenery of its shores.\r\nThese, so far as they could see them, were low, and apparently marshy;\r\nand this is, in fact, the character of the southern shores of Winnipeg.\r\nOn its east and north, however, the country is of a different character.\r\nThere the geological formation is what is termed _primitive_.  The\r\nrocks consist of granite, sienite, gneiss, etcetera; and, as is always\r\nthe case where such rocks are found, the country is hilly and rugged.\r\nOn the western shores a _secondary_ formation exists.  This is\r\n_stratified limestone_,--the same as that which forms the bed of many of\r\nthe great prairies of America; and, indeed, the Lake Winnipeg lies\r\nbetween this secondary formation and the primitive, which bounds it on\r\nthe east.  Along its western shores extends the flat limestone country,\r\npartly wooded and partly prairie land, running from that point for\r\nhundreds of miles up to the very foot of the Rocky Mountains, where the\r\nprimitive rocks again make their appearance in the rugged peaks of that\r\nstupendous chain.  Lake Winnipeg is nearly three hundred miles in\r\nlength, but it is very narrow--being in its widest reach not over fifty\r\nmiles, and in many places only fifteen miles from shore to shore.  It\r\ntrends nearly due north and south, leaning a little north-west and\r\nsouth-east, and receives many large rivers, as the Red, the\r\nSaskatchewan, and the Winnipeg.  The waters of these are again carried\r\nout of it by other rivers that run from the lake, and empty into the\r\nHudson's Bay.  There is a belief among the hunters and voyageurs that\r\nthis lake has its tides like the ocean.  Such, however, is not the case.\r\nThere is at times a rise and overflow of its waters, but it is not\r\nperiodical, and is supposed to be occasioned by strong winds forcing the\r\nwaters towards a particular shore.\r\n\r\nLake Winnipeg is remarkable, as being in the very centre of the North\r\nAmerican continent, and may be called the centre of the _canoe\r\nnavigation_.  From this point it is possible to travel _by water_ to\r\nHudson's Bay on the north-east, to the Atlantic Ocean on the east, to\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico on the south, to the Pacific on the west, and to the\r\nPolar Sea on the north and north-west.  Considering that some of these\r\ndistances are upwards of three thousand miles, it will be perceived that\r\nLake Winnipeg holds a singular position upon the continent.  All the\r\nroutes mentioned can be made without any great \"portage,\" and even a\r\nchoice of route is often to be had upon those different lines of\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nThese were points of information communicated by Norman as the canoe was\r\npaddled along the shore; for Norman, although troubling himself but\r\nlittle about the causes of things, possessed a good practical knowledge\r\nof things as they actually were.  He was tolerably well acquainted with\r\nthe routes, their portages, and distances.  Some of them he had\r\ntravelled over in company with his father, and of others he had heard\r\nthe accounts given by the voyageurs, traders, and trappers.  Norman knew\r\nthat Lake Winnipeg was muddy,--he did not care to inquire the cause.  He\r\nknew that there was a hilly country on its eastern and a low level land\r\non its western shores, but it never occurred to him to speculate on this\r\ngeological difference.  It was the naturalist Lucien who threw out some\r\nhints on this part of the subject, and further added his opinion, that\r\nthe lake came to be there in consequence of the wearing away of the\r\nrocks at the junction of the stratified with the primitive formation,\r\nthus creating an excavation in the surface, which in time became filled\r\nwith water and formed the lake.  This cause he also assigned for the\r\nexistence of a remarkable \"chain of lakes\" that extends almost from the\r\nArctic Sea to the frontiers of Canada.  The most noted of these are\r\nMartin, Great Slave, Athabasca, Wollaston, Deer, Lake Winnipeg, and the\r\nLake of the Woods.  Lucien further informed his companions, that where\r\nprimitive rocks form the surface of a country, that surface will be\r\nfound to exhibit great diversity of aspect.  There will be numerous\r\nlakes and swamps, rugged steep hills with deep valleys between, short\r\nstreams with many falls and rapids.  These are the characteristics of a\r\nprimitive surface.  On the other hand, where secondary rocks prevail the\r\nsurface is usually a series of plains, often high, dry, and treeless, as\r\nis the case upon the great American prairies.\r\n\r\nUpon such topics did Lucien instruct his companions, as they paddled\r\ntheir canoe around the edge of the lake.  They had turned the head of\r\ntheir little vessel westward--as it was their design to keep along the\r\nwestern border of the lake until they should reach the mouth of the\r\nSaskatchewan.  They kept at a short distance from the shore, usually\r\nsteering from point to point, and in this way making their route as\r\ndirect as possible.  It would have been still more direct had they\r\nstruck out into the open lake, and kept up its middle; but this would\r\nhave been a dangerous course to pursue.  There are often high winds upon\r\nLake Winnipeg, that spring up suddenly; and at such times the waves, if\r\nnot mountains high, at least arrive at the height of houses.  Among such\r\nbillows the little craft would have been in danger of being swamped, and\r\nour voyageurs of going to the bottom.  They, therefore, wisely resolved\r\nnot to risk such an accident, but to \"hug the shore,\" though it made\r\ntheir voyage longer.  Each night they would land at some convenient\r\nplace, kindle their fire, cook their supper, and dry their canoe for the\r\nnext day's journey.\r\n\r\nAccording to this arrangement, a little before sunset of the first day\r\nthey came to land and made their camp.  The canoe was unloaded,\r\ncarefully lifted out of the water, and then set bottom upward to drip\r\nand dry.  A fire was kindled, some of the dry meat cooked, and all four\r\nsat down and began to eat, as only hungry travellers can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nWAPITI, WOLVES, AND WOLVERENE.\r\n\r\nThe spot where our voyageurs had landed was at the bottom of a small\r\nbay.  The country back from the lake was level and clear of timber.\r\nHere and there, nearer the shore, however, its surface was prettily\r\ninterspersed with small clumps of willows, that formed little copse-like\r\nthickets of deep green.  Beside one of these thickets, within a hundred\r\nyards of the beach, the fire had been kindled, on a spot of ground that\r\ncommanded a view of the plain for miles back.\r\n\r\n\"Look yonder!\" cried Francois, who had finished eating, and risen to his\r\nfeet.  \"What are these, captain?\"  Francois pointed to some objects that\r\nappeared at a great distance off upon the plain.\r\n\r\nThe \"captain\" rose up, placed his hand so as to shade his eyes from the\r\nsun, and, after looking for a second or two in the direction indicated,\r\nreplied to the other's question by simply saying--\r\n\r\n\"Wapiti.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm no wiser than before I asked the question,\" said Francois.  \"Pray,\r\nenlighten me as to what a wapiti may be!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, red deer; or elk, if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! elk--now I understand you.  I thought they were elk, but they're so\r\nfar off I wasn't sure.\"\r\n\r\nLucien at this moment rose up, and looking through a small telescope,\r\nwhich he carried, confirmed the statement of the \"captain,\" and\r\npronounced it to be a herd of elk.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Luce,\" demanded Francois, \"tell us what you know of the elk.  It\r\nwill pass the time.  Norman says it's no use going after them out there\r\nin the open ground, as they'd shy off before one could get within shot.\r\nYou see there is not a bush within half-a-mile of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we wait,\" interrupted Norman, \"I should not wonder but we may have\r\nthem among the bushes before long.  They appear to be grazing this way.\r\nI warrant you, they'll come to the lake to drink before nightfall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well then: the philosopher can tell us all about them before\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nLucien, thus appealed to, began:--\r\n\r\n\"There are few animals that have so many names as this.  It is called in\r\ndifferent districts, or by different authors, _elk, round-horned elk,\r\nAmerican elk, stag, red deer, grey moose, le biche, wapiti_, and\r\n_wewaskish_.  Naturalists have given not a _few of_ their designations,\r\nas _Cervus Canadensis, Cervus major, Cervus alces, Cervus\r\nstrongylocerus, etcetera_.\r\n\r\n\"You may ask, Why so many names?  I shall tell you.  It is called `elk'\r\nbecause it was supposed by the early colonists to be the same as the elk\r\nof Europe.  Its name of `grey moose' is a hunter appellation, to\r\ndistinguish it from the real moose, which the same hunters know as the\r\n`black moose.'  `Round-horned elk' is also a hunter name.  `Wewaskish,'\r\nor `waskesse,' is an Indian name for the animal.  `Stag' comes from the\r\nEuropean deer so called, because this species somewhat resembles the\r\nstag; and `red deer' is a name used by the Hudson Bay traders.  `Le\r\nbiche' is another synonyme of French authors.\r\n\r\n\"Of all these names I think that of `wapiti,' which our cousin has\r\ngiven, the best.  The names of `elk,' `stag,' and `red deer,' lead to\r\nconfusion, as there are other species to which they properly belong, all\r\nof which are entirely different from the wapiti.  I believe that this\r\nlast name is now used by the best-informed naturalists.\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion,\" continued Lucien, \"the wapiti is the noblest of all the\r\ndeer kind.  It possesses the fine form of the European stag, while it is\r\nnearly a third larger and stronger.  It has all the grace of limb and\r\nmotion that belongs to the common deer, while its towering horns give it\r\na most majestic and imposing appearance.  Its colour during the summer\r\nis of a reddish brown, hence the name red deer; but, indeed, the reddish\r\ntint upon the wapiti is deeper and richer than that of its European\r\ncousin.  The wapiti, like other deer, brings forth its fawns in the\r\nspring.  They are usually a male and female, for two is the number it\r\nproduces.  The males only have horns; and they must be several years old\r\nbefore the antlers become full and branching.  They fall every year, but\r\nnot until February or March, and then the new ones grow out in a month\r\nor six weeks.  During the summer the horns remain soft and tender to the\r\ntouch.  They are covered at this time with a soft membrane that looks\r\nlike greyish velvet, and they are then said to be `in the velvet,' There\r\nare nerves and blood-vessels running through this membrane, and a blow\r\nupon the horns at this season gives great pain to the animal.  When the\r\nautumn arrives the velvet peels off, and they become as hard as bone.\r\nThey would need to be, for this is the `rutting' season, and the bucks\r\nfight furious battles with each other, clashing their horns together, as\r\nif they would break them to pieces.  Very often a pair of bucks, while\r\nthus contending, `lock' their antlers, and being unable to draw them\r\napart, remain head to head, until both die with hunger, or fall a prey\r\nto the prowling wolves.  This is true not only of the elk, but also of\r\nthe reindeer, the moose, and many other species of deer.  Hundreds of\r\npairs of horns have been found thus `locked,' and the solitary hunter\r\nhas often surprised the deer in this unpleasant predicament.\r\n\r\n\"The wapiti utters a whistling sound, that can be heard far off, and\r\noften guides the hunter to the right spot.  In the rutting season the\r\nbucks make other noises, which somewhat resemble the braying of an ass,\r\nand are equally disagreeable to listen to.\r\n\r\n\"The wapiti travel about in small herds, rarely exceeding fifty, but\r\noften of only six or seven.  Where they are not much hunted they are\r\neasily approached, but otherwise they are shy enough.  The bucks, when\r\nwounded and brought to bay, become dangerous assailants; much more so\r\nthan those of the common deer.  Hunters have sometimes escaped with\r\ndifficulty from their horns and hoofs, with the latter of which they can\r\ninflict very severe blows.  They are hunted in the same way as other\r\ndeer; but the Indians capture many of them in the water, when they\r\ndiscover them crossing lakes or rivers.  They are excellent swimmers,\r\nand can make their way over the arm of a lake or across the widest\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n\"They feed upon grass, and sometimes on the young shoots of willows and\r\npoplar-trees.  They are especially fond of a species of wild rose (_Rosa\r\nblanda_), which grows in the countries they frequent.\r\n\r\n\"The wapiti at one time ranged over a large part of the continent of\r\nNorth America.  Its range is now restricted by the spread of the\r\nsettlements.  It is still found in most of the Northern parts of the\r\nUnited States, but only in remote mountainous districts, and even there\r\nit is a rare animal.  In Canada it is more common; and it roams across\r\nthe continent to the shores of the Pacific.  It is not an animal of the\r\ntropical countries, as it is not found in Mexico proper.  On the other\r\nhand, wapiti do not go farther north than about the fifty-seventh\r\nparallel of latitude, and then they are not in their favourite habitat,\r\nwhich is properly the temperate zone.\"\r\n\r\nLucien was interrupted by an exclamation from Basil, who stood up\r\nlooking out upon the prairie.  They all saw that he had been observing\r\nthe wapiti.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" cried they.\r\n\r\n\"Look yonder!\" replied Basil, pointing in the direction of the herd.\r\n\"Something disturbs them.  Give me your glass, Luce.\"\r\n\r\nLucien handed the telescope to his brother, who, drawing it to the\r\nproper focus, pointed it towards the deer.  The rest watched them with\r\nthe naked eye.  They could see that there was some trouble among the\r\nanimals.  There were only six in the herd, and even at the distance our\r\nvoyageurs could tell that they were all bucks, for it was the season\r\nwhen the does secrete themselves in the woods and thickets to bring\r\nforth their young.  They were running to and fro upon the prairie, and\r\ndoubling about as if playing, or rather as if some creature was chasing\r\nthem.  With the naked eye, however, nothing could be seen upon the\r\nground but the bucks themselves, and all the others looked to Basil, who\r\nheld the glass, for an explanation of their odd manoeuvres.\r\n\r\n\"There are wolves at them,\" said Basil, after regarding them for a\r\nsecond or two.\r\n\r\n\"That's odd,\" rejoined Norman.  \"Wolves don't often attack full-grown\r\nwapiti, except when wounded or crippled somehow.  They must be precious\r\nhungry.  What sort of wolves are they?\"\r\n\r\nTo you, boy reader, this question may seem strange.  You, perhaps, think\r\nthat a wolf is a wolf, and there is but one kind.  Such, however, is not\r\nthe exact truth.  In America there are two distinct species of wolves,\r\nand of these two species there are many varieties, which differ so much\r\nin colour and other respects, that some authors have classed them as so\r\nmany distinct species instead of considering them mere varieties.\r\nWhether they may be species or not is still a question among\r\nnaturalists; but certain it is that _two_ well-defined species do exist,\r\nwhich differ in size, form, colour, and habits.  These are the _large_\r\nor _common wolf (Canis lupus_), and the barking or prairie wolf (_Canis\r\nlatrans_).  The first species is the American representative of the\r\ncommon wolf of Europe; and although an animal of similar nature and\r\nhabits, it differs very much from the latter in form and appearance.  It\r\nis, therefore, not the _same_, as hitherto supposed.  This American wolf\r\nis found in greater or less numbers throughout the whole continent; but\r\nin the Northern regions it is very common, and is seen in at least five\r\ndifferent varieties, known by the characteristic names of _black, pied,\r\nwhite, dusky_, and _grey_ wolves.  Of these the grey is the most\r\nnumerous kind; but as I shall have occasion to speak of the large wolves\r\nhereafter, I shall say no more of them at present, but direct your\r\nattention to the second and very different species, the _prairie\r\nwolves_.\r\n\r\nThese are a full third smaller than the common kind.  They are swifter,\r\nand go in larger packs.  They bring forth their young in burrows on the\r\nopen plain, and not among the woods, like the other species.  They are\r\nthe most cunning of American animals, not excepting their kindred the\r\nfoxes.  They cannot be trapped by any contrivance, but by singular\r\nmanoeuvres often themselves decoy the over-curious antelope to approach\r\ntoo near them.  When a gun is fired upon the prairies they may be seen\r\nstarting up on all sides, and running for the spot in hopes of coming in\r\nfor a share of the game.  Should an animal--deer, antelope, or buffalo--\r\nbe wounded, and escape the hunter, it is not likely to escape them also.\r\nThey will set after it, and run it down if _the wound has been a mortal\r\none_.  On the other hand, if the wound has been only slight, and is not\r\nlikely in the end to cripple the animal, the wolves will not stir from\r\nthe spot.  This extraordinary sagacity often tells the hunter whether it\r\nis worth his while to follow the game he has shot at; but in any case he\r\nis likely to arrive late, if the wolves set out before him, as a dozen\r\nof them will devour the largest deer in a few minutes' time.  The\r\nprairie wolves as well as the others follow the herds of buffaloes, and\r\nattack the gravid cows and calves when separated from the rest.\r\nFrequently they sustain a contest with the bulls, when the latter are\r\nold or wounded, but on such occasions many of them get killed before the\r\nold bull becomes their prey.\r\n\r\nThey resemble the common grey wolf in colour, but there are varieties in\r\nthis respect, though not so great as among the larger species.  Their\r\nvoice is entirely different, and consists of three distinct barks,\r\nending in a prolonged howl.  Hence the specific and usual name\r\n\"barking-wolf\" (_Canis latrans_).  They are found only in the Western or\r\nprairie half of the continent, and thence west to the Pacific.  Their\r\nNorthern range is limited to the fifty-fifth parallel of latitude--but\r\nthey are met with southward throughout Mexico, where they are common\r\nenough, and known by the name of \"coyote.\"\r\n\r\nTheir skins are an article of trade with the Hudson's Bay Company.  The\r\nfur is of about the same quality with that of other wolves, and consists\r\nof long hairs, with a thick wool at the base.  In commerce they are\r\ntermed \"cased wolves,\" because their skins, on being removed, are not\r\nsplit open as with the large wolf-skins, but are stript off after the\r\nmanner of rabbits, and then turned inside out, or \"cased,\" as it is\r\ntermed.\r\n\r\nSo much for the _Canis latrans_.\r\n\r\n\"Prairie wolves!\" said Basil, in answer to the question put by his\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\n\"There must be something the matter with one of the bucks, then,\"\r\nremarked Norman, \"or else there's a good big pack of the wolves, and\r\nthey expect to tire one down.  I believe they sometimes do try it that\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"There appears to be a large pack,\" answered Basil, still looking\r\nthrough the glass; \"fifty at least--See! they have separated one of the\r\nbucks from the herd--it's running this way!\"\r\n\r\nBasil's companions had noticed this as soon as himself, and all four now\r\nleaped to their guns.  The wapiti was plainly coming towards them, and\r\nthey could now distinguish the wolves following upon his heels, strung\r\nout over the prairie like a pack of hounds.  When first started, the\r\nbuck was a full half-mile distant, but in less than a minute's time he\r\ncame breasting forward until the boys could see his sparkling eyes and\r\nthe play of his proud flanks.  He was a noble animal to look at.  His\r\nhorns were full-grown, but still \"in the velvet,\" and as he ran with his\r\nsnout thrown forward, his antlers lay along both sides of his neck until\r\ntheir tips touched his shoulders.  He continued on in a direct line\r\nuntil he was within less than an hundred paces of the camp; but,\r\nperceiving the smoke of the fire, and the figures crouching around it,\r\nhe swerved suddenly from his course, and darted into the thicket of\r\nwillows, where he was for the moment hidden from view.  The wolves--\r\nfifty of them at least--had followed him up to this point; and as he\r\nentered the thicket several had been close upon his heels.  The boys\r\nexpected to see the wolves rush in after him--as there appeared to be no\r\nimpediment to their doing so--but, to the astonishment of all, the\r\nlatter came to a sudden halt, and then went sneaking back--some of them\r\neven running off as if terrified!  At first the hunters attributed this\r\nstrange conduct to their own presence, and the smoke of the camp; but a\r\nmoment's reflection convinced them that this could not be the reason of\r\nit, as they were all well acquainted with the nature of the prairie\r\nwolf, and had never witnessed a similar exhibition before.\r\n\r\nThey had no time to think of the wolves just then.  The buck was the\r\nmain attraction, and, calling to each other to surround the thicket, all\r\nfour started in different directions.  In a couple of minutes they had\r\nplaced themselves at nearly equal distances around the copse, and stood\r\nwatching eagerly for the reappearance of the wapiti.\r\n\r\nThe willows covered about an acre of ground, but they were tolerably\r\nthick and full-leaved, and the buck could not be seen from any side.\r\nWherever he was, he was evidently at a standstill, for not a rustle\r\ncould be heard among the leaves, nor were any of the tall stalks seen to\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nMarengo was now sent in.  This would soon start him, and all four stood\r\nwith guns cocked and ready.  But before the dog had made three lengths\r\nof himself into the thicket, a loud snort was heard, followed by a\r\nstruggle and the stamping of hoofs, and the next moment the wapiti came\r\ncrashing through the bushes.  A shot was fired--it was the crack of\r\nLucien's small rifle--but it had missed, for the buck was seen passing\r\nonward and outward.  All ran round to the side he had taken, and had a\r\nfull view of the animal as he bounded off.  Instead of running free as\r\nbefore, he now leaped heavily forward, and what was their astonishment\r\non seeing that he _carried another animal upon his back_!\r\n\r\nThe hunters could hardly believe their eyes, but there it was, sure\r\nenough, a brown shaggy mass, lying flat along the shoulders of the\r\nwapiti, and clutching it with large-spreading claws.  Francois cried\r\nout, \"A panther!\" and Basil at first believed it to be a bear, but it\r\nwas hardly large enough for that.  Norman, however, who had lived more\r\nin those parts where the animal is found, knew it at once to be the\r\ndreaded \"wolverene.\"  Its head could not be seen, as that was hid behind\r\nthe shoulder of the wapiti, whose throat it was engaged in tearing.  But\r\nits short legs and broad paws, its busily tail and long shaggy hair,\r\ntogether with its round-arching back and dark-brown colour, were all\r\nfamiliar marks to the young fur-trader; and he at once pronounced it a\r\n\"wolverene.\"\r\n\r\nWhen first seen, both it and the wapiti were beyond the reach of their\r\nrifles; and the hunters, surprised by such an unexpected apparition, had\r\nsuddenly halted.  Francois and Basil were about to renew the pursuit,\r\nbut were prevented by Norman who counselled them to remain where they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\n\"They won't go far,\" said he; \"let us watch them a bit.  See! the buck\r\ntakes the water!\"\r\n\r\nThe wapiti, on leaving the willows, had run straight out in the first\r\ndirection that offered, which happened to be in a line parallel with the\r\nedge of the lake.  His eye, however, soon caught sight of the water,\r\nand, doubling suddenly round, he made directly towards it, evidently\r\nwith the intention of plunging in.  He had hopes, no doubt, that by this\r\nmeans he might rid himself of the terrible creature that was clinging to\r\nhis shoulders, and tearing his throat to pieces.\r\n\r\nA few bounds brought him to the shore.  There was no beach at the spot.\r\nThe bank--a limestone bluff--rose steeply from the water's edge to a\r\nheight of eight feet, and the lake under it was several fathoms in\r\ndepth.  The buck did not hesitate, but sprang outward and downwards.  A\r\nheavy plash followed, and for some seconds both wapiti and wolverene\r\nwere lost under the water.  They rose to the surface, just as the boys\r\nreached the bank, but they came up _separately_.  The dip had proved a\r\ncooler to the fierce wolverene; and while the wapiti was seen to strike\r\nboldly out into the lake and swim off, the latter--evidently out of his\r\nelement--kept plunging about clumsily, and struggling to get back to the\r\nshore.  Their position upon the cliff above gave the hunters an\r\nexcellent opportunity with their rifles, and both Basil and Norman sent\r\ntheir bullets into the wolverene's back.  Francois also emptied his\r\ndouble-barrelled gun at the same object, and the shaggy brute sank dead\r\nto the bottom of the lake.  Strange to say, not one of the party had\r\nthought of firing at the buck.  This persecution by so many enemies had\r\nwon for him their sympathy, and they would now have suffered him to go\r\nfree, but the prospect of fresh venison for supper overcame their\r\ncommiseration, and the moment the wolverene was despatched all set about\r\nsecuring the deer.  Their guns were reloaded, and, scattering along the\r\nshore, they prepared to await his return.  But the buck, seeing there\r\nwas nothing but death in his rear, swam on, keeping almost in a direct\r\nline out into the lake.  It was evident to all that he could not swim\r\nacross the lake, as its farther shore was not even visible.  He must\r\neither return to where they were, or drown; and knowing this to be his\r\nonly alternative, they stood still and watched his motions.  When he had\r\ngot about half-a-mile from the shore, to the surprise of all, he was\r\nseen to rise higher and higher above the surface, and then all at once\r\nstop, with half of his body clear out of the water!  He had come upon a\r\nshoal, and, knowing the advantage of it, seemed determined to remain\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nBasil and Norman ran to the canoe, and in a few minutes the little craft\r\nwas launched, and shooting through the water.  The buck now saw that it\r\nwas likely to be all up with him, and, instead of attempting to swim\r\nfarther, he faced round and set his antlers forward in a threatening\r\nattitude.  But his pursuers did not give him the chance to make a rush.\r\nWhen within fifty yards or so, Norman, who used the paddles, stopped and\r\nsteadied the canoe, and the next moment the crack of Basil's rifle\r\nechoed over the lake, and the wapiti fell upon the water, where, after\r\nstruggling a moment, he lay dead.\r\n\r\nThe canoe was paddled up, and his antlers being made fast to the stern,\r\nhe was towed back to the shore, and carried into camp.  What now\r\nsurprised our voyageurs was, their finding that the wapiti had been\r\nwounded before encountering either the wolves, wolverene, or themselves.\r\nAn arrow-head, with a short piece of the shaft, was sticking in one of\r\nhis thighs.  The Indians, then, had been after him, and very lately too,\r\nas the wound showed.  It was not a mortal wound, had the arrow-head been\r\nremoved; but of course, as it was, it would have proved his death in the\r\nlong run.  This explained why the wolves had assailed an animal, that\r\notherwise, from his great size and strength, would have defied them.\r\nThe wolverene, moreover, rarely attacks game so large as the wapiti; but\r\nthe latter had, no doubt, chanced upon the lair of his fierce enemy, who\r\ncould not resist such a tempting opportunity of getting a meal.  The\r\nwolves had seen the wolverene as they approached the thicket, and that\r\naccounted for their strange behaviour in the pursuit.  These creatures\r\nare as great cowards as they are tyrants, and their dread of a wolverene\r\nis equal to that with which they themselves often inspire the wounded\r\ndeer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nA PAIR OF DEEP DIVERS.\r\n\r\nThe wapiti was carefully skinned, and the skin spread out to dry.  Since\r\ntheir mishap our voyageurs had been very short of clothing.  The three\r\nskins of the woodland caribou had made only a pair of jackets, instead\r\nof full hunting-shirts, and even these were pinched fits.  For beds and\r\nbed-clothes they had nothing but the hides of buffaloes, and these,\r\nalthough good as far as they went, were only enough for two.  Lucien,\r\nthe most delicate of the party, appropriated one, as the others insisted\r\nupon his so doing.  Francois had the other.  As for Basil and Norman,\r\nthey were forced each night to lie upon the naked earth, and but for the\r\nlarge fires which they kept blazing all the night, they would have\r\nsuffered severely from cold.  Indeed, they did suffer quite enough; for\r\nsome of the nights were so cold, that it was impossible to sleep by the\r\nlargest fire without one-half of their bodies feeling chilled.  The\r\nusual practice with travellers in the Far West is to lie with their feet\r\nto the fire, while the head is at the greatest distance from it.  This\r\nis considered the best mode, for so long as the feet are warm, the rest\r\nof the body will not suffer badly; but, on the contrary, if the feet are\r\nallowed to get cold, no matter what state the other parts be in, it is\r\nimpossible to sleep with comfort.  Of course our young voyageurs\r\nfollowed the well-known practice of the country, and lay with their feet\r\nto the fire in such a manner that, when all were placed, their bodies\r\nformed four radii of a circle, of which the fire was the centre.\r\nMarengo usually lay beside Basil, whom he looked upon as his proper\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding a bed of grass and leaves which they each night spread\r\nfor themselves, they were sadly in want of blankets, and therefore the\r\nskin of the wapiti, which was a very fine one, would be a welcome\r\naddition to their stock of bedding.  They resolved, therefore, to remain\r\none day where they had killed it, so that the skin might be dried and\r\nreceive a partial dressing.  Moreover, they intended to \"jerk\" some of\r\nthe meat--although elk-venison is not considered very palatable where\r\nother meat can be had.  It is without juice, and resembles dry\r\nshort-grained beef more than venison.  For this reason it is looked upon\r\nby both Indians and white hunters as inferior to buffalo, moose,\r\ncaribou, or even the common deer.  One peculiarity of the flesh of this\r\nanimal is, that the fat becomes hard the moment it is taken off the\r\nfire.  It freezes upon the lips like suet, and clings around the teeth\r\nof a person eating it, which is not the case with that of other species\r\nof deer.  The skin of the wapiti, however, is held in high esteem among\r\nthe Indians.  It is thinner than that of the moose, but makes a much\r\nbetter article of leather.  When dressed in the Indian fashion--that is\r\nto say, soaked in a lather composed of the brains and fat of the animal\r\nitself, and then washed, dried, scraped, and smoked--it becomes as soft\r\nand pliable as a kid-glove, and will wash and dry without stiffening\r\nlike chamois leather.  That is a great advantage which it has, in the\r\neyes of the Indians, over the skins of other species of deer, as the\r\nmoose and caribou--for the leather made from these, after a wetting,\r\nbecomes harsh and rigid and requires a great deal of rubbing to render\r\nit soft again.\r\n\r\nLucien knew how to dress the elk-hide, and could make leather out of it\r\nas well as any Indian squaw in the country.  But travelling as they\r\nwere, there was not a good opportunity for that; so they were content to\r\ngive it such a dressing as the circumstances might allow.  It was spread\r\nout on a frame of willow-poles, and set up in front of the fire, to be\r\nscraped at intervals and cleared of the fatty matter, as well as the\r\nnumerous parasites that at this season adhere to the skins of the\r\nwapiti.\r\n\r\nWhile Lucien was framing the skin, Basil and Norman occupied themselves\r\nin cutting the choice pieces of the meat into thin slices and hanging\r\nthem up before the fire.  This job being finished, all sat down to watch\r\nLucien currying his hide.\r\n\r\n\"Ho, boys!\" cried Francois, starting up as if something had occurred to\r\nhim; \"what about the wolverene?  It's a splendid skin--why not get it\r\ntoo?\"\r\n\r\n\"True enough,\" replied Norman, \"we had forgotten that.  But the beasts\r\ngone to the bottom--how can we get at him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, fish him up, to be sure,\" said Francois.  \"Let's splice one of\r\nthese willow-poles to my ramrod, and I'll screw it into him, and draw\r\nhim to the surface in a jiffy.  Come!\"\r\n\r\n\"We must get the canoe round, then,\" said Norman.  \"The bank's too steep\r\nfor us to reach him without it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" assented Francois, at the same time going towards the\r\nwillows; \"get you the canoe into the water, while I cut the sapling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay!\" cried Basil, \"I'll show you a shorter method.  Marengo!\"\r\n\r\nAs Basil said this, he rose to his feet, and walked down to the bluff\r\nwhere they had shot the wolverene.  All of them followed him as well as\r\nMarengo, who bounded triumphantly from side to side, knowing he was\r\nwanted for some important enterprise.\r\n\r\n\"Do you expect the dog to fetch him out?\" inquired Norman.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Basil; \"only to help.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment--you shall see.\"\r\n\r\nBasil flung down his 'coon-skin cap, and stripped off his caribou\r\njacket, then his striped cotton shirt, then his under-shirt of fawn\r\nskin, and, lastly, his trousers, leggings, and mocassins.  He was now as\r\nnaked as Adam.\r\n\r\n\"I'll show you, cousin,\" said he, addressing himself to Norman, \"how we\r\ntake the water down there on the Mississippi.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he stepped forward to the edge of the bluff; and having\r\ncarefully noted the spot where the wolverene had gone down, turned to\r\nthe dog, and simply said--\r\n\r\n\"Ho!  Marengo!  _Chez moi_!\"  The dog answered with a whimper, and a\r\nlook of intelligence which showed that he understood his master's wish.\r\n\r\nBasil again pointed to the lake, raised his arms over his head, placing\r\nhis palms close together, launched himself out into the air, and shot\r\ndown head-foremost into the water.\r\n\r\nMarengo, uttering a loud bay, sprang after so quickly that the plunges\r\nwere almost simultaneous, and both master and dog were for some time\r\nhidden from view.  The latter rose first, but it was a long time before\r\nBasil came to the surface--so long that Norman and the others were\r\nbeginning to feel uneasy, and to regard the water with some anxiety.  At\r\nlength, however, a spot was seen to bubble, several yards from where he\r\nhad gone down, and the black head of Basil appeared above the surface.\r\nIt was seen that he held something in his teeth, and was pushing a heavy\r\nbody before him, which they saw was the wolverene.\r\n\r\nMarengo, who swam near, now seized hold of the object, and pulled it\r\naway from his master, who, calling to the dog to follow, struck out\r\ntowards a point where the bank was low and shelving.  In a few minutes\r\nBasil reached a landing-place, and shortly after Marengo arrived towing\r\nthe wolverene, which was speedily pulled out upon the bank, and carried,\r\nor rather dragged, by Norman and Francois to the camp.  Lucien brought\r\nBasil's clothes, and all four once more assembled around the blazing\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThere is not a more hideous-looking animal in America than the\r\nwolverene.  His thick body and short stout legs, his shaggy coat and\r\nbushy tail, but, above all, his long curving claws and doglike jaws,\r\ngive him a formidable appearance.  His gait is low and skulking, and his\r\nlook bold and vicious.  He walks somewhat like a bear, and his tracks\r\nare often mistaken for those of that animal.  Indians and hunters,\r\nhowever, know the difference well.  His hind-feet are plantigrade, that\r\nis, they rest upon the ground from heel to toe; and his back curves like\r\nthe segment of a circle.  He is fierce and extremely voracious--quite as\r\nmuch so as the \"glutton,\" of which he is the American representative.\r\nNo animal is more destructive to the small game, and he will also attack\r\nand devour the larger kinds when he can get hold of them; but as he is\r\nsomewhat slow, he can only seize most of them by stratagem.  It is a\r\ncommon belief that he lies in wait upon trees and rocks to seize the\r\ndeer passing beneath.  It has been also asserted that he places moss,\r\nsuch as these animals feed upon, under his perch, in order to entice\r\nthem within reach; and it has been still further asserted, that the\r\narctic foxes assist him in his plans, by hunting the deer towards the\r\nspot where he lies in wait, thus acting as his jackals.  These\r\nassertions have been made more particularly about his European cousin,\r\nthe \"glutton,\" about whom other stories are told equally strange--one of\r\nthem, that he eats until scarce able to walk, and then draws his body\r\nthrough a narrow space between two trees, in order to relieve himself\r\nand get ready for a fresh meal.  Buffon and others have given credence\r\nto these tales upon the authority of one \"Olaus Magnus,\" whose name,\r\nfrom the circumstance, might be translated \"great fibber.\"  There is no\r\ndoubt, however, that the glutton is one of the most sagacious of\r\nanimals, and so, too, is the wolverene.  The latter gives proof of this\r\nby many of his habits; one in particular fully illustrates his cunning.\r\nIt is this.  The marten-trappers of the Hudson Bay territory set their\r\ntraps in the snow, often extending over a line of fifty miles.  These\r\ntraps are constructed out of pieces of wood found near the spot, and are\r\nbaited with the heads of partridges, or pieces of venison, of which the\r\nmarten (_Mustela martes_) is very fond.  As soon as the marten seizes\r\nthe bait, a trigger is touched, and a heavy piece of wood falling upon\r\nthe animal, crushes or holds it fast.  Now the wolverene _enters the\r\ntrap from behind_, tears the back out of it before touching the bait,\r\nand thus avoids the falling log!  Moreover, he will follow the tracks of\r\nthe trapper from one to another, until he has destroyed the whole line.\r\nShould a marten happen to have been before him, and got caught in the\r\ntrap, he rarely ever eats it, as he is not fond of its flesh.  But he is\r\nnot satisfied to leave it as he finds it.  He usually digs it from under\r\nthe log, tears it to pieces, and then buries it under the snow.  The\r\nfoxes, who are well aware of this habit, and who themselves greedily eat\r\nthe marten, are frequently seen following him upon such excursions.\r\nThey are not strong enough to take the log from off the trapped animal,\r\nbut from their keen scent can soon find it where the other has buried it\r\nin the snow.  In this way, instead of their being providers for the\r\nwolverene, the reverse is the true story.  Notwithstanding, the\r\nwolverene will eat _them_ too, whenever he can get his claws upon them;\r\nbut as they are much swifter than he, this seldom happens.  The foxes,\r\nhowever, are themselves taken in traps, or more commonly shot by guns\r\nset for the purpose, with the bait attached by a string to the trigger.\r\nOften the wolverene, finding the foxes dead or wounded, makes a meal of\r\nthem before the hunter comes along to examine his traps and guns.  The\r\nwolverene kills many of the foxes while young, and sometimes on finding\r\ntheir burrow, widens it with his strong claws, and eats the whole family\r\nin their nests.  Even young wolves sometimes become his prey.  He lives,\r\nin fact, on very bad terms with both foxes and wolves, and often robs\r\nthe latter of a fat deer which they may have just killed, and are\r\npreparing to dine upon.  The beaver, however, is his favourite food, and\r\nbut that these creatures can escape him by taking to the water--in which\r\nelement he is not at all at home--he would soon exterminate their whole\r\nrace.  His great strength and acute scent enable him to overcome almost\r\nevery wild creature of the forest or prairie.  He is even said to be a\r\nfull match for either the panther or the black bear.\r\n\r\nThe wolverene lives in clefts of rock, or in hollow trees, where such\r\nare to be found; but he is equally an inhabitant of the forest and the\r\nprairie.  He is found in fertile districts, as well as in the most\r\nremote deserts.  His range is extensive, but he is properly a denizen of\r\nthe cold and snowy regions.  In the southern parts of the United States\r\nhe is no longer known, though it is certain that he once lived there\r\nwhen those countries were inhabited by the beaver.  North of latitude 40\r\ndegrees he ranges perhaps to the pole itself, as traces of him have been\r\nfound as far as man has yet penetrated.  He is a solitary creature, and,\r\nlike most predatory animals, a nocturnal prowler.  The female brings\r\nforth two, sometimes three and four, at a birth.  The cubs are of a\r\ncream colour, and only when full-grown acquire that dark-brown hue,\r\nwhich in the extreme of winter often passes into black.  The fur is not\r\nunlike that of the bear, but is shorter-haired, and of less value than a\r\nbear-skin.  Notwithstanding, it is an article of trade with the Hudson's\r\nBay Company, who procure many thousands of the skins annually.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian voyageurs call the wolverene \"carcajou;\" while among the\r\nOrkney and Scotch servants of the Hudson's Bay Company he is oftener\r\nknown as the \"quickhatch.\"  It is supposed that both these names are\r\ncorruptions of the Cree word _okee-coo-haw-gew_ (the name of the\r\nwolverene among the Indians of that tribe).  Many words from the same\r\nlanguage have been adopted by both voyageurs and traders.\r\n\r\nThose points in the natural history of the wolverene, that might be\r\ncalled _scientific_, were imparted by Lucien, while Norman furnished the\r\ninformation about its habits.  Norman knew the animal as one of the most\r\ncommon in the \"trade\"; and in addition to what we have recorded, also\r\nrelated many adventures and stories current among the voyageurs, in\r\nwhich this creature figures in quite as fanciful a manner, as he does in\r\nthe works either of Olaus Magnus, or Count de Buffon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nA GRAND SUNDAY DINNER.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining a day at their first camp on the lake, our voyageurs\r\ncontinued their journey.  Their course lay a little to the west of\r\nnorth, as the edge of the lake trended in that direction.  Their usual\r\nplan, as already stated, was to keep out in the lake far enough to shun\r\nthe numerous indentations of the shore, yet not so far as to endanger\r\ntheir little craft when the wind was high.  At night they always landed,\r\neither upon some point or on an island.  Sometimes the wind blew \"dead\r\nahead,\" and then their day's journey would be only a few miles.  When\r\nthe wind was favourable they made good progress, using the skin of the\r\nwapiti for a sail.  On one of these days they reckoned a distance of\r\nover forty miles from camp to camp.  It was their custom always to lie\r\nby on Sunday, for our young voyageurs were Christians.  They had done so\r\non their former expedition across the Southern prairies, and they had\r\nfound the practice to their advantage in a physical as well as a moral\r\nsense.  They required the rest thus obtained; besides, a general\r\ncleaning up is necessary, at least, once every week.  Sunday was also a\r\nday of feasting with them.  They had more time to devote to culinary\r\noperations, and the _cuisine_ of that day was always the most varied of\r\nthe week.  Any extra delicacy obtained by the rifle on previous days,\r\nwas usually reserved for the Sunday's dinner.  On the first Sunday after\r\nentering Lake Winnipeg the \"camp\" chanced to be upon an island.  It was\r\na small island, of only a few acres in extent.  It lay near the shore,\r\nand was well wooded over its whole surface with trees of many different\r\nkinds.  Indeed, islands in a large lake usually have a great variety of\r\ntrees, as the seeds of all those sorts that grow around the shores are\r\ncarried thither by the waves, or in the crops of the numerous birds that\r\nflit over its waters.  But as the island in question lay in a lake,\r\nwhose shores exhibited such a varied geology, it was natural the\r\nvegetation of the island itself should be varied.  And, in truth; it was\r\nso.  There were upon it, down by the water's edge, willows and\r\ncottonwoods (_Populus angulata_), the characteristic _sylva_ of the\r\nprairie land; there were birches and sugar-maples (_Acer saccharinum_);\r\nand upon some higher ground, near the centre, appeared several species\r\nthat belonged more to the primitive formations that bounded the lake on\r\nthe east.  These were pines and spruces, the juniper, and tamarack or\r\nAmerican larch (_Laryx Americana_); and among others could be\r\ndistinguished the dark cone-shaped forms of the red cedar-trees.  Among\r\nthe low bushes and shrubs there were rose and wild raspberry; there were\r\napple and plum trees, and whole thickets of the \"Pembina\" (_Viburnum\r\noxycoccos_).  There is, in fact, no part of the world where a greater\r\nvariety of wild fruit has been found indigenous than upon the banks of\r\nthe Red River of the North, and this variety extended to the little\r\nisland where our voyageurs had encamped.\r\n\r\nThe camp had been placed under a beautiful tree--the tacamahac, or\r\nbalsam poplar (_Populus balsamifera_).  This is one of the finest trees\r\nof America, and one of those that extend farthest north into the cold\r\ncountries.  In favourable situations it attains a height of one hundred\r\nand fifty feet, with a proportionate thickness of trunk; but it is\r\noftener only fifty or eighty feet high.  Its leaves are oval, and, when\r\nyoung, of a rich yellowish colour, which changes to a bright green.  The\r\nbuds are very large, yellow, and covered with a varnish, which exhales a\r\ndelightful fragrance, and gives to the tree its specific name.\r\n\r\nIt was near sunset on the afternoon of Saturday; the travellers had just\r\nfinished their repast, and were reclining around a fire of red cedar,\r\nwhose delicate smoke curled up among the pale-green leaves of the\r\npoplars.  The fragrant smell of the burning wood, mixed with the\r\naromatic odour of the balsam-tree, filled the air with a sweet perfume,\r\nand, almost without knowing why, our voyageurs felt a sense of pleasure\r\nstealing over them.  The woods of the little island were not without\r\ntheir voices.  The scream of the jay was heard, and his bright azure\r\nwing appeared now and then among the foliage.  The scarlet plumage of\r\nthe cardinal grosbeak flashed under the beams of the setting sun; and\r\nthe trumpet-note of the ivory-billed woodpecker was heard near the\r\ncentre of the island.  An osprey was circling in the air, with his eye\r\nbent on the water below, watching for his finny prey; and a pair of bald\r\neagles (_Haliaetus leucocephalus_) were winging their way towards the\r\nadjacent mainland.  Half-a-dozen turkey vultures (_Cathartes atratus_)\r\nwere wheeling above the beach, where some object, fish or carrion, had\r\nbeen thrown up by the waves.\r\n\r\nFor some time the party remained silent, each contemplating the scene\r\nwith feelings of pleasure.  Francois, as usual, first broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"I say, cook, what's for dinner to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\nIt was to Lucien this speech was addressed.  He was regarded as the\r\n_maitre de cuisine_.\r\n\r\n\"Roast or boiled--which would you prefer?\" asked the cook, with a\r\nsignificant smile.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed Francois; \"boiled, indeed! a pretty boil we could\r\nhave in a tin cup, holding less than a pint.  I wish we _could_ have a\r\nboiled joint and a bowl of soup.  I'd give something for it.  I'm\r\nprecious tired of this everlasting dry roast.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall have both,\" rejoined Lucien, \"for to-morrow's dinner.  I\r\npromise you both the soup and the joint.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Francois laughed incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to make soup in your shoe, Luce?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but I shall make it in this.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Lucien held up a vessel somewhat like a water-pail, which the day\r\nbefore he had himself made out of birch-bark.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Francois, \"I know you have got a vessel that holds\r\nwater, but cold water ain't soup; and if you can boil water in that\r\nvessel, I'll believe you to be a conjuror.  I know you can do some\r\ncurious things with your chemical mixtures; but that you can't do, I'm\r\nsure.  Why, man, the bottom would be burned out of your bucket before\r\nthe water got blood-warm.  Soup, indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Frank, you shall see.  You're only like the rest of\r\nmankind--incredulous about everything they can't comprehend.  If you'll\r\ntake your hook and line, and catch some fish, I promise to give you a\r\ndinner to-morrow, with all the regular courses--soup, fish, boiled,\r\nroast, and dessert, too!  I'm satisfied I can do all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Parbleu_! brother, you should have been cook to Lucullus.  Well, I'll\r\ncatch the fish for you.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Francois took a fish-hook and line out of his pouch, and\r\nfixing a large grasshopper upon the hook, stepped forward to the edge of\r\nthe water, and cast it in.  The float was soon seen to bob and then\r\nsink, and Francois jerked his hook ashore with a small and very pretty\r\nfish upon it of a silver hue, with which the lake and the waters running\r\ninto it abound.  Lucien told him it was a fish of the genus _Hyodon_.\r\nHe also advised him to bait with a worm, and let his bait sink to the\r\nbottom, and he might catch a sturgeon, which would be a larger fish.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know there are sturgeon in the lake?\" inquired Francois.\r\n\r\n\"I am pretty sure of that,\" answered the naturalist; \"the sturgeon\r\n(_Acipenser_) is found all round the world in the northern temperate\r\nzone--both in its seas and fresh waters; although, when you go farther\r\nsouth into the warmer climate, no sturgeons exist.  I am sure there are\r\nsome here, perhaps more than one species.  Sink your bait, for the\r\nsturgeon is a toothless fish, and feeds upon soft substances at the\r\nbottom.\"\r\n\r\nFrancois followed the advice of his brother, and in a few minutes he had\r\na \"nibble,\" and drew up and landed a very large fish, full three feet in\r\nlength.  Lucien at once pronounced it a sturgeon, but of a species he\r\nhad not before seen.  It was the _Acipenser carbonarius_, a curious sort\r\nof fish found in these waters.  It did not look like a fish that would\r\nbe pleasant eating; therefore Francois again took to bobbing for the\r\nsilver fish (_Hyodons_), which, though small, he knew to be excellent\r\nwhen broiled.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said Basil, \"I must furnish my quota to this famous dinner that\r\nis to be.  Let me see what there is on the island in the way of game;\"\r\nand shouldering his rifle, he walked off among the trees.\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Norman, \"am not going to eat the produce of other people's\r\nlabour without contributing my share.\"\r\n\r\nSo the young trader took up his gun and went off in a different\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" exclaimed Lucien, \"we are likely to have plenty of meat for the\r\ndinner.  I must see about the vegetables;\" and taking with him his\r\nnew-made vessel, Lucien sauntered off along the shore of the islet.\r\nFrancois alone remained by the camp, and continued his fishing.  Let us\r\nfollow the plant-hunter, and learn a lesson of practical botany.\r\n\r\nLucien had not gone far, when he came to what appeared to be a mere\r\nsedge growing in the water.  The stalks or culms of this sedge were full\r\neight feet high, with smooth leaves, an inch broad, nearly a yard in\r\nlength, and of a light green colour.  At the top of each stalk was a\r\nlarge panicle of seeds, somewhat resembling a head of oats.  The plant\r\nitself was the famous wild rice (_Zizania aquatica_), so much prized by\r\nthe Indians as an article of food, and also the favourite of many wild\r\nbirds, especially the reed-bird or rice-bunting.  The grain of the\r\nzizania was not yet ripe, but the ears were tolerably well filled, and\r\nLucien saw that it would do for his purpose.  He therefore waded in, and\r\nstripped off into his vessel as much as he wanted.\r\n\r\n\"I am safe for rice-soup, at all events,\" soliloquised he, \"but I think\r\nI can do still better;\" and he continued on around the shore, and\r\nshortly after struck into some heavy timber that grew in a damp, rich\r\nsoil.  He had walked about an hundred yards farther, when he was seen to\r\nstoop and examine some object on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"It ought to be found here,\" he muttered to himself; \"this is the very\r\nsoil for it,--yes, here we have it!\"\r\n\r\nThe object over which he was stooping was a plant, but its leaves\r\nappeared shrivelled, or rather quite withered away.  The upper part of a\r\nbulbous root, however, was just visible above the surface.  It was a\r\nbulb of the wild leek (_Allium tricoccum_.)  The leaves, when young, are\r\nabout six inches in length, of a flat shape and often three inches\r\nbroad; but, strange to say, they shrivel or die off very early in the\r\nseason,--even before the plant flowers, and then it is difficult to find\r\nthe bulb.\r\n\r\nLucien, however, had sharp eyes for such things; and in a short while he\r\nhad rooted out several bulbs as large as pigeons' eggs, and deposited\r\nthem in his birchen vessel.  He now turned to go back to camp, satisfied\r\nwith what he had obtained.  He had the rice to give consistency to his\r\nsoup, and the leek-roots to flavour it with.  That would be enough.\r\n\r\nAs he was walking over a piece of boggy ground his eye was attracted to\r\na singular plant, whose tall stem rose high above the grass.  It was\r\nfull eight feet in height, and at its top there was an umbel of\r\nconspicuous white flowers.  Its leaves were large, lobed, and toothed,\r\nand the stem itself was over an inch in diameter, with furrows running\r\nlongitudinally.  Lucien had never seen the plant before, although he had\r\noften heard accounts of it, and he at once recognised it from its\r\nbotanical description.  It was the celebrated \"cow parsnip\" (_Heracleum\r\nlanatum_).  Its stem was jointed and hollow, and Lucien had heard that\r\nthe Indians called it in their language \"flute-stem,\" as they often used\r\nit to make their rude musical instruments from, and also a sort of\r\nwhistle or \"call,\" by which they were enabled to imitate and decoy\r\nseveral kinds of deer.  But there was another use to which the plant was\r\nput, of which the naturalist was not aware.  Norman, who had been\r\nwandering about, came up at this moment, and seeing Lucien standing by\r\nthe plant, uttered a joyful \"Hulloh!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" inquired Lucien, \"what pleases you, coz?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the flute-stem, of course.  You talked of making a soup.  It will\r\nhelp you, I fancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" demanded Lucien.\r\n\r\n\"Why, the young stems are good eating, and the roots, if you will; but\r\nthe young shoots are better.  Both Indians and voyageurs eat them in\r\nsoup, and are fond of them.  It's a famous thing, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us gather some, then,\" said Lucien; and the cousins commenced\r\ncutting off such stems as were still young and tender.  As soon as they\r\nhad obtained enough, they took their way back to the camp.  Basil had\r\nalready arrived with a fine _prairie hen (Tetrao cupido_) which he had\r\nshot, and Norman had brought back a squirrel; so that, with Francois's\r\nfish, of which a sufficient number had been caught, Lucien was likely to\r\nbe able to keep his promise about the dinner.\r\n\r\nFrancois, however, could not yet comprehend how the soup was to be\r\nboiled in a wooden pot; and, indeed, Basil was unable to guess.  Norman,\r\nhowever, knew well enough, for he had travelled through the country of\r\nthe Assinoboil Indians, who take their name from this very thing.  He\r\nhad also witnessed the operation performed by Crees, Chippewas, and even\r\nvoyageurs, where metal or earthen pots could not be obtained.\r\n\r\nOn the next day the mystery was cleared up to Basil and Francois.\r\nLucien first collected a number of stones--about as large as\r\npaving-stones.  He chose such as were hard and smooth.  These he flung\r\ninto the cinders, where they soon became red-hot.  The water and meat\r\nwere now put into the bark pot, and then one stone after another,--each\r\nbeing taken out as it got cooled,--until the water came to a fierce\r\nboil.  The rice and other ingredients were added at the proper time, and\r\nin a short while an excellent soup was made.  So much, then, for the\r\nsoup, and the boiled dishes with vegetables.  The roast, of course, was\r\neasily made ready upon green-wood spits, and the \"game\" was cooked in a\r\nsimilar way.  The fish were broiled upon the red cinders, and eaten, as\r\nis usual, after the soup.  There were no puddings or pies, though, no\r\ndoubt, Lucien could have made such had they been wanted.  In their place\r\nthere was an excellent service of fruit.  There were strawberries and\r\nraspberries, one sort of which found wild in this region is of a most\r\ndelicious flavour.  There were gooseberries and currants; but the most\r\ndelicious fruit, and that which Francois liked best, was a small berry\r\nof a dark blue colour, not unlike the huckleberry, but much sweeter and\r\nof higher flavour.  It grows on a low bush or shrub with ovate leaves;\r\nand this bush when it blossoms is so covered with beautiful white\r\nflowers, that neither leaves nor branches can be seen.  There are no\r\nless than four varieties of it known, two of which attain to the height\r\nof twenty feet or more.  The French Canadians call it \"le poire,\" but in\r\nmost parts of America it is known as the \"service-berry,\" although\r\nseveral other names are given to it in different districts.  Lucien\r\ninformed his companions, while they were crushing its sweet purplish\r\nfruit between their teeth, that its botanical name is _Amelanchier_.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" remarked Francois, \"if we only had a cup of coffee and a glass of\r\nwine, we might say that we had dined in fashionable style.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" replied Lucien, \"we are better without the wine, and as for\r\nthe other I cannot give you that, but I fancy I can provide you with a\r\ncup of tea if you only allow me a little time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tea!\" screamed Francois; \"why, there's not a leaf of tea nearer than\r\nChina; and for the sugar, not a grain within hundreds of miles!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Frank,\" said Lucien, \"nature has not been so ungenerous here,--\r\neven in such luxuries as tea and sugar.  Look yonder!  You see those\r\nlarge trees with the dark-coloured trunks.  What are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sugar-maples,\" replied Francois.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Lucien, \"I think even at this late season we might contrive\r\nto extract sap enough from them to sweeten a cup of tea.  You may try,\r\nwhile I go in search of the tea-plant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word, Luce, you are equal to a wholesale grocery.  Very well.\r\nCome, Basil, we'll tap the maples; let the captain go with Luce.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys, separating into pairs, walked off in different directions.\r\nLucien and his companion soon lighted upon the object of their search in\r\nthe same wet bottom where they had procured the _Heracleum_.  It was a\r\nbranching shrub, not over two feet in height, with small leaves of a\r\ndeep green colour above, but whitish and woolly underneath.  It is a\r\nplant well-known throughout most of the Hudson's Bay territory by the\r\nname of \"Labrador tea-plant;\" and is so called because the Canadian\r\nvoyageurs, and other travellers through these northern districts, often\r\ndrink it as tea.  It is one of the _Ericaceae_, or heath tribe, of the\r\ngenus _Ledum_--though it is not a true heath, as, strange to say, no\r\ntrue heath is found upon the continent of America.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of it known,--the \"narrow-leafed\" and\r\n\"broad-leafed;\" and the former makes the best tea.  But the pretty white\r\nflowers of the plant are better for the purpose than the leaves of\r\neither variety; and these it was that were now gathered by Lucien and\r\nNorman.  They require to be dried before the decoction is made; but this\r\ncan be done in a short time over a fire; and so in a short time it was\r\ndone, Norman having parched them upon heated stones.  Meanwhile Basil\r\nand Francois had obtained the sugar-water, and Lucien having washed his\r\nsoup-kettle clean, and once more made his boiling stones red-hot,\r\nprepared the beverage; and then it was served out in the tin cup, and\r\nall partook of it.  Norman had drunk the Labrador tea before, and was\r\nrather fond of it, but his Southern cousins did not much relish it.  Its\r\npeculiar flavour, which somewhat resembles rhubarb, was not at all to\r\nthe liking of Francois.  All, however, admitted that it produced a\r\ncheering effect upon their spirits; and, after drinking it, they felt in\r\nthat peculiarly happy state of mind which one experiences after a cup of\r\nthe real \"Bohea.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE MARMOTS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nFrom such a luxurious dinner you may suppose that our young voyageurs\r\nlived in prime style.  But it was not always so.  They had their fasts\r\nas well as feasts.  Sometimes for days they had nothing to eat but the\r\njerked deer-meat.  No bread--no beer--no coffee, nothing but water--dry\r\nvenison and water.  Of course, this is food enough for a hungry man; but\r\nit can hardly be called luxurious living.  Now and then a wild duck, or\r\na goose, or perhaps a young swan, was shot; and this change in their\r\ndiet was very agreeable.  Fish were caught only upon occasions, for\r\noften these capricious creatures refused Francois' bait, however\r\ntemptingly offered.  After three weeks' coasting the Lake, they reached\r\nthe Saskatchewan, and turning up that stream, now travelled in a due\r\nwesterly direction.  At the Grand Rapids, near the mouth of this river,\r\nthey were obliged to make a portage of no less than three miles, but the\r\nmagnificent view of these \"Rapids\" fully repaid them for the toil they\r\nunderwent in passing them.\r\n\r\nThe Saskatchewan is one of the largest rivers in America, being full\r\n1600 miles in length, from its source in the Rocky Mountains to its\r\n_debouchure_, under the name of the \"Nelson River,\" in Hudson's Bay.\r\nFor some distance above Lake Winnipeg, the country upon its banks is\r\nwell wooded.  Farther up, the river runs through dry sandy prairies that\r\nextend westward to the foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains.  Many of these\r\nprairies may be properly called \"deserts.\"  They contain lakes as salt\r\nas the ocean itself, and vast tracts--hundreds of square miles in\r\nextent--where not a drop of water is to be met with.  But the route of\r\nour voyageurs did not lie over these prairies.  It was their intention,\r\nafter reaching Cumberland House, to turn again in a northerly direction.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when within two days' journey of the Fort, they had\r\nencamped upon the bank of the Saskatchewan.  They had chosen a beautiful\r\nspot for their camp, where the country, swelling into rounded hills, was\r\nprettily interspersed with bushy copses of _Amelanchiers_, and _Rosa\r\nblanda_, whose pale red flowers were conspicuous among the green leaves,\r\nand filled the air with a sweet fragrance, that was wafted to our\r\nvoyageurs upon the sunny breeze.  The ground was covered with a grassy\r\nsward enamelled by the pink flowers of the _Cleome_, and the deeper red\r\nblossoms of the beautiful wind-flower (_Anemone_).  Upon that day our\r\ntravellers had not succeeded in killing any game, and their dinner was\r\nlikely to consist of nothing better than dry venison scorched over the\r\ncoals.  As they had been travelling all the morning against a sharp\r\ncurrent, and, of course, had taken turn about at the paddles, they all\r\nfelt fatigued, and none of them was inclined to go in search of game.\r\nThey had flung themselves down around the fire, and were waiting until\r\nthe venison should be broiled for dinner.\r\n\r\nThe camp had been placed at the foot of a tolerably steep hill, that\r\nrose near the banks of the river.  There was another and higher hill\r\nfacing it, the whole front of which could be seen by our travellers as\r\nthey sat around their fire.  While glancing their eyes along its\r\ndeclivity, they noticed a number of small protuberances or mounds\r\nstanding within a few feet of each other.  Each of them was about a foot\r\nin height, and of the form of a truncated cone--that is, a cone with its\r\ntop cut off, or beaten down.\r\n\r\n\"What are they?\" inquired Francois.\r\n\r\n\"I fancy,\" answered Lucien, \"they are marmot-houses.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are,\" affirmed Norman; \"there are plenty of them in this country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! marmots!\" said Francois.  \"Prairie-dogs, you mean?--the same we met\r\nwith on the Southern prairies?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" replied Norman: \"I think the prairie-dogs are a different\r\nsort.  Are they not, Cousin Luce?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" answered the naturalist; \"these must be a different species.\r\nThere are too few of them to be the houses of prairie-dogs.  The `dogs'\r\nlive in large settlements, many hundreds of them in one place; besides,\r\ntheir domes are somewhat different in appearance from these.  The mounds\r\nof the prairie-dogs have a hole in the top or on one side.  These, you\r\nsee, have not.  The hole is in the ground beside them, and the hill is\r\nin front, made by the earth taken out of the burrow, just as you have\r\nseen it at the entrance of a rat's hole.  They are marmots, I have no\r\ndoubt, but of a different species from the prairie-dog marmots.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there not many kinds of marmots in America?  I have heard so,\" said\r\nFrancois.\r\n\r\nThis question was of course addressed to Lucien.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered he.  \"The _fauna_ of North America is peculiarly rich in\r\nspecies of these singular animals.  There are thirteen kinds of them,\r\nwell-known to naturalists; and there are even some varieties in these\r\nthirteen kinds that might almost be considered distinct species.  I have\r\nno doubt, moreover, there are yet other species which have not been\r\ndescribed.  Perhaps, altogether, there are not less than twenty\r\ndifferent kinds of marmots in North America.  As only one or two species\r\nare found in the settled territories of the United States, it was\r\nsupposed, until lately, that there were no others.  Latterly the\r\nnaturalists of North America have been very active in their researches,\r\nand no genus of animals has rewarded them so well as the marmots--\r\nunless, perhaps, it may be the squirrels.  Almost every year a new\r\nspecies of one or the other of these has been found--mostly inhabiting\r\nthe vast wilderness territories that lie between the Mississippi and the\r\nPacific Ocean.\r\n\r\n\"As regards the marmots, the _closet-naturalists_, as usual, have\r\nrendered their history as complicated and difficult to be understood as\r\npossible.  They have divided them into several genera, because one kind\r\nhappens to have a larger tubercle upon its tooth than another, or a\r\nlittle more curving in its claws, or a shorter tail.  It is true that in\r\nthe thirteen species some differ considerably from the others in size,\r\ncolour, and other respects.  Yet, for all that, there is such an\r\nidentity, if I may so express it, about the mode of life, the food, the\r\nappearance, and habits of all the thirteen, that I think it is both\r\nabsurd and ill-judged to render the study of them more difficult, by\r\nthus dividing them into so many genera.  They are all _marmots_, that is\r\nwhat they are; and why confound the study of them by calling them\r\nspermophiles and arctomys, and such-like hard names?\"\r\n\r\n\"I quite agree with you, Luce,\" said the hunter, Basil, who, although\r\nnot averse to the study of natural history (all hunters, I believe, love\r\nit more or less), had no great opinion of the closet-naturalists and\r\n\"babblers about teeth,\" as he contemptuously called them.\r\n\r\n\"When a family of animals,\" continued Lucien, \"contains a great many\r\nspecies, and these species differ widely from each other, I admit that\r\nit may then be convenient and useful to class them into genera, and\r\nsometimes even sub-genera; but, on the other hand, when there are only a\r\nfew species, and these closely allied to each other, I think nothing can\r\nbe more ridiculous than this dividing and subdividing, and giving such\r\nunpronounceable names to them.  It is this that renders the study\r\ndifficult, because even the committing to memory such a string of\r\nunmeaning phrases is of itself no easy task.  Take, for example, such a\r\nphrase as `_Arctomys spermophilus Rickardsonii_,' which, although nearly\r\na yard long, means simply the `tawny marmot.'  Do not mistake me,\"\r\ncontinued Lucien; \"I do not object to the use of the Greek or Latin\r\nphraseology used in such cases.  Some universal language must be\r\nadopted, so that the naturalists of different countries may understand\r\neach other.  But then this language should, when translated, describe\r\nthe animal, by giving some of its characteristics, and thus have a\r\nmeaning.  On the contrary, it usually, when put into plain English,\r\ngives us only the name--often a clumsy and unpronounceable German one--\r\nof some obscure friend of the author, or, as is not unfrequently the\r\ncase, some lordly patron for whom your closet-naturalist entertains a\r\nflunkeyish regard, and avails himself of this means of making it known\r\nto his Maecenas.  In my opinion,\" continued Lucien, warming with the\r\nenthusiasm of a true naturalist, \"it is a most impertinent interference\r\nwith the beautiful things of Nature--her birds and quadrupeds, her\r\nplants and flowers--to couple them with the names of kings, princes,\r\nlords, and lordlings, who chance to be the local gods of some\r\ncloset-naturalist.  It is these catalogue-makers who generally multiply\r\nsynonymes so as to render science unintelligible.  Sitting in their\r\neasy-chairs they know little or nothing of the habits of the animals\r\nabout which they write; and therefore, to write something original, they\r\nmultiply names, and give measurements _ad infinitum_, and this among\r\nthem constitutes a science.  I do not, of course, include among these\r\nthe man whose name is given--Richardson.  No; he was a true naturalist,\r\nwho travelled and underwent hardships to earn the high name which he\r\nbears and so well deserves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother Luce,\" said Basil, \"you grow excited upon this subject, and\r\nthat is something of a rarity to see.  I agree with you, however, in all\r\nyou have said.  Previous to our leaving home I read several books\r\nupon natural history.  They were the works of distinguished\r\ncloset-naturalists.  Well, I found that all the information they\r\ncontained about the animals of these Northern regions--at least, all\r\nthat could be called _information_--I had read somewhere before.  After\r\nthinking for a while I recollected where.  It was in the pages of the\r\ntraveller Hearne--a man who, among these scientific gentlemen, is\r\nconsidered only in the light of a rude traveller, and not deserving the\r\nname of naturalist.  Hearne journeyed to the Arctic Sea so early as the\r\nyear 1771; and to him the world is indebted for their first knowledge of\r\nthe fact that there was no strait across the Continent south of the\r\nseventieth parallel of latitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Lucien, \"he was sent out by the Hudson's Bay Company,\r\nperhaps more scantily furnished than any explorer ever was before.  He\r\nunderwent the most dreadful hardships and perils, and has left behind\r\nhim an account of the inhabitants and natural history of these parts, so\r\nfull and so truthful, that it has not only stood the test of subsequent\r\nobservation, but the closet-naturalists have added but little to it ever\r\nsince.  Most of them have been satisfied with giving just what poor\r\nHearne had gathered--as, in fact, they knew nothing more, and could not,\r\ntherefore, add anything.  Some of them have quoted his own words, and\r\ngiven him the credit of his vast labour; while others have endeavoured\r\nto pass off Hearne's knowledge as their own, by giving a slightly\r\naltered paraphrase of his language.  This sort of thing,\" said Lucien,\r\n\"makes me indignant.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's downright mean,\" interposed Norman.  \"All of us in this country\r\nhave heard of Hearne.  He was a right hardy traveller, and no mistake\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Lucien, cooling down, and resuming the subject of the\r\nmarmots, \"these little animals seem to form a link between the squirrels\r\nand rabbits.  On the side of the squirrels they very naturally join on,\r\nif I may use the expression, to the ground-squirrel, and some of them\r\ndiffer but little in their habits from many of the latter.  Other\r\nspecies, again, are more allied to the rabbits, and less like the\r\nsquirrels; and there are two or three kinds that I should say--using a\r\nYankee expression--have a `sprinkling' of the rat in them.  Some, as the\r\nground-hog, or wood-chuck of the United States, are as large as rabbits,\r\nwhile others, as the leopard-marmot, are not bigger than Norway rats.\r\nSome species have cheek-pouches, in which they can carry a large\r\nquantity of seeds, nuts, and roots, when they wish to hoard them up for\r\nfuture use.  These are the spermophiles, and some species of these have\r\nmore capacious pouches than others.  Their food differs somewhat,\r\nperhaps according to the circumstances in which they may be placed.  In\r\nall cases it is vegetable.  Some, as the prairie-dogs, live upon\r\ngrasses, while others subsist chiefly upon seeds, berries, and leaves.\r\nIt was long supposed that the marmots, like the squirrels, laid up\r\nstores against the winter.  I believe this is not the case with any of\r\nthe different species.  I know for certain that most of them pass the\r\nwinter in a state of torpidity, and of course require no provisions, as\r\nthey eat nothing during that season.  In this we observe one of those\r\ncases in which Nature so beautifully adapts a creature to its\r\ncircumstances.  In the countries where many of the marmots are found, so\r\nsevere are the winters, and so barren the soil, that it would be\r\nimpossible for these creatures to get a morsel of food for many long\r\nmonths.  During this period, therefore, Nature suspends her functions,\r\nby putting them into a deep, and, for aught we know to the contrary, a\r\npleasant sleep.  It is only when the snow melts, under the vernal sun,\r\nand the green blades of grass and the spring flowers array themselves on\r\nthe surface of the earth, that the little marmots make their appearance\r\nagain.  Then the warm air, penetrating into their subterranean abodes,\r\nadmonishes them to awake from their protracted slumber, and come forth\r\nto the enjoyment of their summer life.  These animals may be said,\r\ntherefore, to have no winter.  Their life is altogether a season of\r\nsummer and sunshine.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the marmots,\" continued Lucien, \"live in large communities, as\r\nthe prairie-dogs; others, in smaller tribes, while still other species\r\nlead a solitary life, going only in pairs, or at most in families.\r\nNearly all of them are burrowing animals, though there are one or two\r\nspecies that are satisfied with a cleft in the rock, or a hole among\r\nloose stones for their nests.  Some of them are tree-climbers, but it is\r\nsupposed they only ascend trees in search of food, as they do not make\r\ntheir dwellings there.  Many of the species are very prolific, the\r\nfemales bringing forth eight, and even ten young at a birth.\r\n\r\n\"The marmots are extremely shy and watchful creatures.  Before going to\r\nfeed, they usually reconnoitre the ground from the tops of their little\r\nmounds.  Some species do not have such mounds, and for this purpose\r\nascend any little hillock that may be near.  Nearly all have the curious\r\nhabit of placing sentries to watch while the rest are feeding.  These\r\nsentries station themselves on some commanding point, and when they see\r\nan enemy approaching give warning to the others by a peculiar cry.  In\r\nseveral of the species this cry resembles the syllables `seek-seek'\r\nrepeated with a hiss.  Others bark like `toy-dogs,' while still other\r\nkinds utter a whistling noise, from which one species derives its\r\ntrivial name of `whistler' among the traders, and is the `siffleur' of\r\nthe Canadian voyageurs.\r\n\r\n\"The `whistler's' call of alarm can be heard at a great distance; and\r\nwhen uttered by the sentinel is repeated by all the others as far as the\r\ntroop extends.\r\n\r\n\"The marmots are eaten both by Indians and white hunters.  Sometimes\r\nthey are captured by pouring water into their burrows; but this method\r\nonly succeeds in early spring, when the animals awake out of their\r\ntorpid state, and the ground is still frozen hard enough to prevent the\r\nwater from filtering away.  They are sometimes shot with guns; but,\r\nunless killed upon the spot, they will escape to their burrows, and\r\ntumble in before the hunter can lay his hands upon them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE BLAIREAU, THE \"TAWNIES,\" AND THE \"LEOPARDS.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps Lucien would have carried his account of the marmots still\r\nfarther--for he had not told half what he knew of their habits--but he\r\nwas at that moment interrupted by the marmots themselves.  Several of\r\nthem appeared at the mouths of their holes; and, after looking out and\r\nreconnoitring for some moments, became bolder, and ran up to the tops of\r\ntheir mounds, and began to scatter along the little beaten paths that\r\nled from one to the other.  In a short while as many as a dozen could be\r\nseen moving about, jerking their tails, and at intervals uttering their\r\n\"seek-seek.\"\r\n\r\nOur voyageurs saw that there were two kinds of them, entirely different\r\nin colour, size, and other respects.  The larger ones were of a greyish\r\nyellow above, with an orange tint upon the throat and belly.  These were\r\nthe \"tawny marmots,\" called sometimes \"ground-squirrels,\" and by the\r\nvoyageurs, \"siffleurs,\" or \"whistlers.\"  The other species seen were the\r\nmost beautiful of all the marmots.  They were very little smaller than\r\nthe tawny marmots; but their tails were larger and more slender, which\r\nrendered their appearance more graceful.  Their chief beauty, however,\r\nlay in their colours and markings.  They were striped from the nose to\r\nthe rump with bands of yellow and chocolate colour, which alternated\r\nwith each other, while the chocolate bands were themselves variegated by\r\nrows of yellow spots regularly placed.  These markings gave the animals\r\nthat peculiar appearance so well-known as characterising the skin of the\r\nleopard, hence the name of these little creatures was \"leopard-marmots.\"\r\n\r\nIt was plain from their actions that both kinds were \"at home\" among the\r\nmounds, and that both had their burrows there.  This was the fact, and\r\nNorman told his companion that the two kinds are always found together,\r\nnot living in the same houses, but only as neighbours in the same\r\n\"settlement.\"  The burrows of the \"leopard\" have much smaller entrances\r\nthan those of their \"tawny kin,\" and run down perpendicularly to a\r\ngreater depth before branching off in a horizontal direction.  A\r\nstraight stick may be thrust down one of these full five feet before\r\nreaching an \"elbow.\"  The holes of the tawny marmots, on the contrary,\r\nbranch off near the surface, and are not so deep under ground.  This\r\nguides us to the explanation of a singular fact--which is, that the\r\n\"tawnies\" make their appearance three weeks earlier in spring than the\r\n\"leopards,\" in consequence of the heat of the sun reaching them sooner,\r\nand waking them out of their torpid sleep.\r\n\r\nWhile these explanations were passing among the boys, the marmots had\r\ncome out, to the number of a score, and were carrying on their gambols\r\nalong the declivity of the hill.  They were at too great a distance to\r\nheed the movements of the travellers by the camp-fire.  Besides, a\r\nconsiderable valley lay between them and the camp, which, as they\r\nbelieved, rendered their position secure.  They were not at such a\r\ndistance but that many of their movements could be clearly made out by\r\nthe boys, who after a while noticed that several furious battles were\r\nbeing fought among them.  It was not the \"tawnies\" against the others,\r\nbut the males of each kind in single combats with one another.  They\r\nfought like little cats, exhibiting the highest degree of boldness and\r\nfury; but it was noticed that in these conflicts the leopards were far\r\nmore active and spiteful than their kinsmen.  In observing them through\r\nhis glass Lucien noticed that they frequently seized each other by the\r\ntails, and he further noticed that several of them had their tails much\r\nshorter than the rest.  Norman said that these had been bitten off in\r\ntheir battles; and, moreover, that it was a rare thing to find among the\r\nmales, or \"bucks,\" as he called them, one that had a perfect tail!\r\n\r\nWhile these observations were being made, the attention of our party was\r\nattracted to a strange animal that was seen slowly crawling around the\r\nhill.  It was a creature about as big as an ordinary setter dog, but\r\nmuch thicker in the body, shorter in the legs, and shaggier in the coat.\r\nIts head was flat, and its ears short and rounded.  Its hair was long,\r\nrough, and of a mottled hoary grey colour, but dark-brown upon the legs\r\nand tail.  The latter, though covered with long hair, was short, and\r\ncarried upright; and upon the broad feet of the animal could be seen\r\nlong and strong curving claws.  Its snout was sharp as that of a\r\ngreyhound--though not so prettily formed--and a white stripe, passing\r\nfrom its very tip over the crown, and bordered by two darker bands, gave\r\na singular expression to the animal's countenance.  It was altogether,\r\nboth in form and feature, a strange and vicious-looking creature.\r\nNorman recognised it at once as the \"blaireau,\" or American badger.  The\r\nothers had never seen such a creature before--as it is not an inhabitant\r\nof the South, nor of any part of the settled portion of the United\r\nStates, for the animal there sometimes called a badger is the\r\nground-hog, or Maryland marmot (_Arctomys monax_).  Indeed, it was for a\r\nlong time believed that no true badger inhabited the Continent of\r\nAmerica.  Now, however, it is known that such exists, although it is of\r\na species distinct from the badger of Europe.  It is less in size than\r\nthe latter, and its fur is longer, finer, and lighter in colour; but it\r\nis also more voracious in its habits, preying constantly upon mice,\r\nmarmots, and other small animals, and feeding upon carcasses, whenever\r\nit chances to meet with such.  It is an inhabitant of the sandy and\r\nbarren districts, where it burrows the earth in such a manner that\r\nhorses frequently sink and snap their legs in the hollow ground made by\r\nit.  These are not always the holes scraped out for its own residence,\r\nbut the burrows of the marmots, which the blaireau has enlarged, so that\r\nit may enter and prey upon them.  In this way the creature obtains most\r\nof its food, but as the marmots lie torpid during the winter months, and\r\nthe ground above them is frozen as hard as a rock, it is then impossible\r\nfor the blaireau to effect an entrance.  At this season it would\r\nundoubtedly starve had not Nature provided against such a result, by\r\ngiving it the power of sleeping throughout the winter months as well as\r\nthe marmots themselves, which it does.  As soon as it wakes up and comes\r\nabroad, it begins its campaign against these little creatures; and it\r\nprefers, above all others, the \"tawnies,\" and the beautiful \"leopards,\"\r\nboth of which it persecutes incessantly.\r\n\r\nThe badger when first seen was creeping along with its belly almost\r\ndragging the ground, and its long snout projected horizontally in the\r\ndirection of the marmot \"village.\"  It was evidently meditating a\r\nsurprise of the inhabitants.  Now and then it would stop, like a pointer\r\ndog when close to a partridge, reconnoitre a moment, and then go on\r\nagain.  Its design appeared to be to get between the marmots and their\r\nburrows, intercept some of them, and get a hold of them without the\r\ntrouble of digging them up--although that would be no great affair to\r\nit, for so strong are its fore-arms and claws that in loose soil it can\r\nmake its way under the ground as fast as a mole.\r\n\r\nSlowly and cautiously it stole along, its hind-feet resting all their\r\nlength upon the ground, its hideous snout thrown forward, and its eyes\r\nglaring with a voracious and hungry expression.  It had got within fifty\r\npaces of the marmots, and would, no doubt, have succeeded in cutting off\r\nthe retreat of some of them, but at that moment a burrowing owl (_Strix\r\ncunicularia_), that had been perched upon one of the mounds, rose up,\r\nand commenced hovering in circles above the intruder.  This drew the\r\nattention of the marmot sentries to their well-known enemy, and their\r\nwarning cry was followed by a general scamper of both tawnies and\r\nleopards towards their respective burrows.\r\n\r\nThe blaireau, seeing that further concealment was no longer of any use,\r\nraised himself higher upon his limbs, and sprang forward in pursuit.  He\r\nwas too late, however, as the marmots had all got into their holes, and\r\ntheir angry \"seek-seek,\" was heard proceeding from various quarters out\r\nof the bowels of the earth.  The blaireau only hesitated long enough to\r\nselect one of the burrows into which he was sure a marmot had entered;\r\nand then, setting himself to his work, he commenced throwing out the\r\nmould like a terrier.  In a few seconds he was half buried, and his\r\nhindquarters and tail alone remained above ground.  He would soon have\r\ndisappeared entirely, but at that moment the boys, directed and headed\r\nby Norman, ran up the hill, and seizing him by the tail, endeavoured to\r\njerk him back.  That, however, was a task which they could not\r\naccomplish, for first one and then another, and then Basil and Norman--\r\nwho were both strong boys--pulled with all their might, and could not\r\nmove him.  Norman cautioned them against letting him go, as in a\r\nmoment's time he would burrow beyond their reach.  So they held on until\r\nFrancois had got his gun ready.  This the latter soon did, and a load of\r\nsmall shot was fired into the blaireau's hips, which, although it did\r\nnot quite kill him, caused him to back out of the hole, and brought him\r\ninto the clutches of Marengo.  A desperate struggle ensued, which ended\r\nby the bloodhound doubling his vast black muzzle upon the throat of the\r\nblaireau, and choking him to death in less than a dozen seconds; and\r\nthen his hide--the only part which was deemed of any value--was taken\r\noff and carried to the camp.  The carcass was left upon the face of the\r\nhill, and the red shining object was soon espied by the buzzards and\r\nturkey vultures, so that in a few minutes' time several of these filthy\r\nbirds were seen hovering around, and alighting upon the hill.\r\n\r\nBut this was no new sight to our young voyageurs, and soon ceased to be\r\nnoticed by them.  Another bird, of a different kind, for a short time\r\nengaged their attention.  It was a large hawk, which Lucien, as soon as\r\nhe saw it, pronounced to be one of the kind known as buzzards (_Buteo_).\r\nOf these there are several species in North America, but it is not to\r\nbe supposed that there is any resemblance between them and the buzzards\r\njust mentioned as having alighted by the carcass of the blaireau.  The\r\nlatter, commonly called \"turkey buzzards,\" are true vultures, and feed\r\nmostly, though not exclusively, on carrion; while the \"hawk buzzards\"\r\nhave all the appearance and general habits of the rest of the falcon\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\nThe one in question, Lucien said, was the \"marsh-hawk,\" sometimes also\r\ncalled the \"hen-harrier\" (_Falco uliginosus_).  Norman stated that it\r\nwas known among the Indians of these parts as the \"snake-bird,\" because\r\nit preys upon a species of small green snake that is common on the\r\nplains of the Saskatchewan, and of which it is fonder than of any other\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe voyageurs were not long in having evidence of the appropriateness of\r\nthe Indian appellation; for these people, like other savages, have the\r\ngood habit of giving names that express some quality or characteristic\r\nof the thing itself.  The bird in question was on the wing, and from its\r\nmovements evidently searching for game.  It sailed in easy circlings\r\nnear the surface, _quartering_ the ground like a pointer dog.  It flew\r\nso lightly that its wings were not seen to move, and throughout all its\r\nwheelings and turnings it appeared to be carried onwards or upwards by\r\nthe power of mere volition.  Once or twice its course brought it\r\ndirectly over the camp, and Francois had got hold of his gun, with the\r\nintention of bringing it down, but on each occasion it perceived his\r\nmotions; and, soaring up like a paper-kite until out of reach, it passed\r\nover the camp, and then sank down again upon the other side, and\r\ncontinued its \"quarterings\" as before.  For nearly half-an-hour it went\r\non manoeuvring in this way, when all at once it was seen to make a\r\nsudden turning in the air as it fixed its eyes upon some object in the\r\ngrass.  The next moment it glided diagonally towards the earth, and\r\npoising itself for a moment above the surface, rose again with a small\r\ngreen-coloured snake struggling in its talons.  After ascending to some\r\nheight, it directed its flight towards a clump of trees, and was soon\r\nlost to the view of our travellers.\r\n\r\nLucien now pointed out to his companions a characteristic of the hawk\r\nand buzzard tribe, by which these birds can always be distinguished from\r\nthe true falcon.  That peculiarity lay in the manner of seizing their\r\nprey.  The former skim forward upon it sideways--that is, in a\r\nhorizontal or diagonal direction, and pick it up in passing; while the\r\ntrue falcons--as the merlin, the peregrine, the gerfalcon, and the great\r\neagle-falcons--shoot down upon their prey _perpendicularly_ like an\r\narrow, or a piece of falling lead.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out, moreover, how the structure of the different kinds of\r\npreying birds, such as the size and form of the wings and tail, as well\r\nas other parts, were in each kind adapted to its peculiar mode of\r\npursuing its prey; and then there arose a discussion as to whether this\r\nadaptation should be considered a _cause_ or an _effect_.  Lucien\r\nsucceeded in convincing his companions that the structure was the effect\r\nand not the cause of the habit, for the young naturalist was a firm\r\nbeliever in the changing and progressive system of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nAN ODD SORT OF DECOY-DUCK.\r\n\r\nTwo days after the adventure with the blaireau, the young voyageurs\r\narrived at Cumberland House--one of the most celebrated posts of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company.  The chief factor, who resided there, was a friend\r\nof Norman's father, and of course the youths were received with the\r\nwarmest hospitality, and entertained during their stay in the best\r\nmanner the place afforded.  They did not make a long stay, however, as\r\nthey wished to complete their journey before the winter should set in,\r\nwhen canoe-travelling would become impossible.  During winter, not only\r\nthe lakes, but the most rapid rivers of these Northern regions, become\r\nfrozen up, and remain so for many months.  Nearly the whole surface of\r\nthe earth is buried under deep snow, and travelling can only be done\r\nwith snow-shoes, or with sledges drawn by dogs.  These are the modes\r\npractised by the Indians, the Esquimaux, and the few white traders and\r\ntrappers who have occasion in winter to pass from one point to another\r\nof that icy and desolate region.\r\n\r\nTravelling under such circumstances is not only difficult and laborious,\r\nbut is extremely perilous.  Food cannot always be obtained--supplies\r\nfall short, or become exhausted--game is scarce, or cannot be found at\r\nall, as at that season many of the quadrupeds and most of the birds have\r\nforsaken the country, and migrated to the South--and whole parties of\r\ntravellers--even Indians, who can eat anything living or dead, roast or\r\nraw--often perish from hunger.\r\n\r\nOur travellers were well acquainted with these facts; and being anxious,\r\ntherefore, to get to the end of their journey before the winter should\r\ncome down upon them, made all haste to proceed.  Of course they obtained\r\na new \"outfit\" at the Fort; but they took with them only such articles\r\nas were absolutely necessary, as they had many portages to make before\r\nthey could reach the waters of the Mackenzie River.  As it required two\r\nof the party to carry the canoe, with a few little things besides, all\r\nthe baggage was comprised in such loads as the others could manage; and\r\nof course that was not a great deal, for Francois was but a lad, and\r\nLucien was far from being in robust health.  A light axe, a few cooking\r\nutensils, with a small stock of provisions, and of course their guns,\r\nformed the bulk of their loads.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Fort they kept for several days' journey up the\r\nSaskatchewan.  They then took leave of that river, and ascended a small\r\nstream that emptied into it from the north.  Making their first portage\r\nover a \"divide,\" they reached another small stream that ran in quite a\r\ndifferent direction, emptying itself into one of the branches of the\r\nMississippi, or Churchill River.  Following this in a north-westerly\r\ncourse, and making numerous other portages, they reached Lake La Crosse,\r\nand afterwards in succession, Lakes Clear, Buffalo, and Methy.  A long\r\n\"portage\" from the last-mentioned lake brought them to the head of a\r\nstream known as the \"Clear Water;\" and launching their canoe upon this,\r\nthey floated down to its mouth, and entered the main stream of the Elk,\r\nor Athabasca, one of the most beautiful rivers of America.  They were\r\nnow in reality upon the waters of the Mackenzie itself, for the Elk,\r\nafter passing through the Athabasca Lake, takes from thence the name of\r\nSlave River, and having traversed Great Slave Lake, becomes the\r\nMackenzie--under which name it continues on to the Arctic Ocean.  Having\r\ngot, therefore, upon the main head-water of the stream which they\r\nintended to traverse, they floated along in their canoe with light\r\nhearts and high hopes.  It is true they had yet fifteen hundred miles to\r\ntravel, but they believed that it was all down-hill work now; and as\r\nthey had still nearly two months of summer before them, they doubted not\r\nbeing able to accomplish the voyage in good time.\r\n\r\nOn they floated down-stream, feasting their eyes as they went--for the\r\nscenery of the Elk valley is of a most picturesque and pleasing\r\ncharacter; and the broad bosom of the stream itself, studded with wooded\r\nislands, looked to our travellers more like a continuation of lakes than\r\na running river.  Now they glided along without using an oar, borne\r\nonward by the current; then they would take a spell at the paddles,\r\nwhile the beautiful Canadian boat-song could be heard as it came from\r\nthe tiny craft, and the appropriate chorus \"Row, brothers, row!\" echoed\r\nfrom the adjacent shores.  No part of their journey was more pleasant\r\nthan while descending the romantic Elk.\r\n\r\nThey found plenty of fresh provisions, both in the stream itself and on\r\nits banks.  They caught salmon in the water, and the silver-coloured\r\nhyodon, known among the voyageurs by the name of \"Dore.\"  They shot both\r\nducks and geese, and roast-duck or goose had become an everyday dinner\r\nwith them.  Of the geese there were several species.  There were\r\n\"snow-geese,\" so called from their beautiful white plumage; and\r\n\"laughing geese,\" that derive their name from the circumstance that\r\ntheir call resembles the laugh of a man.  The Indians decoy these by\r\nstriking their open hand repeatedly over the mouth while uttering the\r\nsyllable \"wah.\"  They also saw the \"Brent goose,\" a well-known species,\r\nand the \"Canada goose,\" which is the _wild goose par excellence_.\r\nAnother species resembling the latter, called the \"barnacle goose,\" was\r\nseen by our travellers.  Besides these, Lucien informed them that there\r\nwere several other smaller kinds that inhabit the northern countries of\r\nAmerica.  These valuable birds are objects of great interest to the\r\npeople of the fur countries for months in the year.  Whole tribes of\r\nIndians look to them as a means of support.\r\n\r\nWith regard to ducks, there was one species which our travellers had not\r\nyet met with, and for which they were every day upon the look-out.  This\r\nwas the far-famed \"canvass-back,\" so justly celebrated among the\r\nepicures of America.  None of them had ever eaten of it, as it is not\r\nknown in Louisiana, but only upon the Atlantic coast of the United\r\nStates.  Norman, however, had heard of its existence in the Rocky\r\nMountains--where it is said to breed--as well as in other parts of the\r\nfur countries, and they were in hopes that they might fall in with it\r\nupon the waters of the Athabasca.  Lucien was, of course, well\r\nacquainted with its \"biography,\" and could have recognised one at sight;\r\nand as they glided along he volunteered to give his companions some\r\ninformation, not only about this particular species, but about the whole\r\ngenus of these interesting birds.\r\n\r\n\"The canvass-back,\" began he, \"is perhaps the most celebrated and\r\nhighly-prized of all the ducks, on account of the exquisite flavour of\r\nits flesh--which is thought by some epicures to be superior to that of\r\nall other birds.  It is not a large duck--rarely weighing over three\r\npounds--and its plumage is far from equalling in beauty that of many\r\nother species.  It has a red or chestnut-coloured head, a shining black\r\nbreast, while the greater part of its body is of a greyish colour; but\r\nupon close examination this grey is found to be produced by a whitish\r\nground minutely mottled with zig-zag black lines.  I believe it is this\r\nmottling, combined with the colour, which somewhat resembles the\r\nappearance and texture of ship's canvass, that has given the bird its\r\ntrivial name; but there is some obscurity about the origin of this.  In\r\ncolour, however, it so nearly resembles the `pochard,' or `red-head' of\r\nEurope, and its near congener the red-head (_Anas ferina_) of America,\r\nthat at a distance it is difficult to distinguish them from each other.\r\nThe last-mentioned species is always found associated with the\r\ncanvass-backs, and are even sold for the latter in the markets of New\r\nYork and Philadelphia.  A naturalist, however, can easily distinguish\r\nthem by their bills and eyes.  The canvass-back has red eyes, with a\r\ngreenish black bill, nearly straight; while the eyes of the red-head are\r\nof an orange yellow, its bill bluish and concave along the upper ridge.\r\n\r\n\"The canvass-back is known in natural history as _Anas valisneria_, and\r\nthis specific name is given to it because it feeds upon the roots of an\r\naquatic plant, a species of `tape-grass,' or `eel-grass;' but\r\nbotanically called `_Valisneria_,' after the Italian botanist, Antonio\r\nValisneri.  This grass grows in slow-flowing streams, and also on shoals\r\nby the seaside--where the water, from the influx of rivers, is only\r\nbrackish.  The water where it grows is usually three to five feet in\r\ndepth, and the plant itself rises above the surface to the height of two\r\nfeet or more, with grass-like leaves of a deep green colour.  Its roots\r\nare white and succulent, and bear some resemblance to celery--hence the\r\nplant is known among the duck-hunters as `wild celery.'  It is upon\r\nthese roots the canvass-back almost exclusively feeds, and they give to\r\nthe flesh of these birds its peculiar and pleasant flavour.  Wherever\r\nthe valisneria grows in quantity, as in the Chesapeake Bay and some\r\nrivers, like the Hudson, there the canvass-backs resort, and are rarely\r\nseen elsewhere.  They do not eat the leaves but only the white soft\r\nroots, which they dive for and pluck up with great dexterity.  The\r\nleaves when stripped of the root are suffered to float off upon the\r\nsurface of the water; and where the ducks have been feeding, large\r\nquantities of them, under the name of `grass wrack,' are thrown by the\r\nwind and tide upon the adjacent shores.\r\n\r\n\"Shooting the canvass-backs is a source of profit to hundreds of gunners\r\nwho live around the Chesapeake Bay, as these birds command a high price\r\nin the markets of the American cities.  Disputes have arisen between the\r\nfowlers of different States around the Bay about the right of shooting\r\nupon it; and vessels full of armed men--ready to make war upon one\r\nanother--have gone out on this account.  But the government of these\r\nStates succeeded in settling the matter peacefully, and to the\r\nsatisfaction of all parties.\"\r\n\r\nThe canoe at this moment shot round a bend, and a long smooth expanse of\r\nthe river appeared before the eyes of our voyageurs.  They could see\r\nthat upon one side another stream ran in, with a very sluggish current;\r\nand around the mouth of this, and for a good stretch below it, there\r\nappeared a green sedge-like water-grass, or rushes.  Near the border of\r\nthis sedge, and in a part of it that was thin, a flock of wild fowl was\r\ndiving and feeding.  They were small, and evidently ducks; but the\r\ndistance was yet too great for the boys to make out to what species they\r\nbelonged.  A single large swan--a trumpeter--was upon the water, between\r\nthe shore and the ducks, and was gradually making towards the latter.\r\nFrancois immediately loaded one of his barrels with swan, or rather\r\n\"buck\" shot, and Basil looked to his rifle.  The ducks were not thought\r\nof--the trumpeter was to be the game.  Lucien took out his telescope,\r\nand commenced observing the flock.  They had not intended to use any\r\nprecaution in approaching the birds, as they were not extremely anxious\r\nabout getting a shot, and were permitting the canoe to glide gently\r\ntowards them.  An exclamation from Lucien, however, caused them to\r\nchange their tactics.  He directed them suddenly to \"hold water\" and\r\nstop the canoe, at the same time telling them that the birds ahead were\r\nthe very sort about which they had been conversing--the \"canvass-backs.\"\r\nHe had no doubt of it, judging from their colour, size, and peculiar\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nThe announcement produced a new excitement.  All four were desirous not\r\nonly of shooting, but of _eating_, a canvass-back; and arrangements were\r\nset about to effect the former.  It was known to all that the\r\ncanvass-backs are among the shyest of water-fowl, so much so that it is\r\ndifficult to approach them unless under cover.  While feeding, it is\r\nsaid, they keep sentinels on the look-out.  Whether this be true or not,\r\nit is certain that they never all dive together, some always remaining\r\nabove water, and apparently watching while the others are under.  A plan\r\nto get near them was necessary, and one was suggested by Norman, which\r\nwas to tie bushes around the sides of the canoe, so as to hide both the\r\nvessel and those in it.  This plan was at once adopted--the canoe was\r\npaddled up to the bank--thick bushes were cut, and tied along the\r\ngunwale; and then our voyageurs climbed in, and laying themselves as low\r\nas possible, commenced paddling gently downward in the direction of the\r\nducks.  The rifles were laid aside, as they could be of little service\r\nwith such game.  Francois' double-barrel was the arm upon which\r\ndependence was now placed; and Francois himself leaned forward in the\r\nbow in order to be ready, while the others attended to the guidance of\r\nthe vessel.  The buck-shot had been drawn out, and a smaller kind\r\nsubstituted.  The swan was no longer cared for or even thought of.\r\n\r\nIn about a quarter of an hour's time, the canoe, gliding silently along\r\nthe edge of the sedge--which was the wild celery (_Valisneria\r\nspiralis_)--came near the place where the ducks were; and the boys,\r\npeeping through the leafy screen, could now see the birds plainly.  They\r\nsaw that they were not all canvass-backs, but that three distinct kinds\r\nof ducks were feeding together.  One sort was the canvass-backs\r\nthemselves, and a second kind very much resembled them, except that they\r\nwere a size smaller.  These were the \"red-heads\" or \"pochards.\"  The\r\nthird species was different from either.  They had also heads of a\r\nreddish colour, but of a brighter red, and marked by a white band that\r\nran from the root of the bill over the crown.  This mark enabled Lucien\r\nat once to tell the species.  They were widgeons (_Anas Americana_); but\r\nthe most singular thing that was now observed by our voyageurs was the\r\nterms upon which these three kinds of birds lived with each other.  It\r\nappeared that the widgeon obtained its food by a regular system of\r\nrobbery and plunder perpetrated upon the community of the canvass-backs.\r\nThe latter, as Lucien had said, feeds upon the roots of the valisneria;\r\nbut for these it is obliged to dive to the depth of four or five feet,\r\nand also to spend some time at the bottom while plucking them up.  Now\r\nthe widgeon is as fond of the \"celery\" as the canvass-back, but the\r\nformer is not a diver--in fact, never goes under water except when\r\nwashing itself or in play, and it has therefore no means of procuring\r\nthe desired roots.  Mark, then, the plan that it takes to effect this\r\nend.  Seated as near as is safe to the canvass-back, it waits until the\r\nlatter makes his _somersault_ and goes down.  It (the widgeon) then\r\ndarts forward so as to be sufficiently close, and, pausing again, scans\r\nthe surface with eager eye.  It can tell where the other is at work, as\r\nthe blades of the plant at which it is tugging are seen to move above\r\nthe water.  These at length disappear, pulled down as the plant is\r\ndragged from its root, and almost at the same instant the canvass-back\r\ncomes up holding the root between his mandibles.  But the widgeon is\r\nready for him.  He has calculated the exact spot where the other will\r\nrise; and, before the latter can open his eyes or get them clear of the\r\nwater, the widgeon darts forward, snatches the luscious morsel from his\r\nbill, and makes off with it.  Conflicts sometimes ensue; but the\r\nwidgeon, knowing himself to be the lesser and weaker bird, never stands\r\nto give battle, but secures his prize through his superior agility.  On\r\nthe other hand, the canvass-back rarely attempts to follow him, as he\r\nknows that the other is swifter upon the water than he.  He only looks\r\nafter his lost root with an air of chagrin, and then, reflecting that\r\nthere is \"plenty more where it came from,\" kicks up its heels, and once\r\nmore plunges to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe red-head rarely interferes with either, as he is contented to feed\r\nupon the leaves and stalks, at all times floating in plenty upon the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nAs the canoe glided near, those on board watched these curious\r\nmanoeuvres of the birds with feelings of interest.  They saw, moreover,\r\nthat the \"trumpeter\" had arrived among them, and the ducks seemed to\r\ntake no notice of him.  Lucien was struck with something unusual in the\r\nappearance of the swan.  Its plumage seemed ruffled and on end, and it\r\nglided along in a stiff and unnatural manner.  It moved its neck neither\r\nto one side nor the other, but held its head bent forward, until its\r\nbill almost touched the water, in the attitude that these birds adopt\r\nwhen feeding upon something near the surface.  Lucien said nothing to\r\nhis companions, as they were all silent, lest they might frighten the\r\nducks; but Basil and Norman had also remarked the strange look and\r\nconduct of the trumpeter.  Francois' eyes were bent only upon the ducks,\r\nand he did not heed the other.\r\n\r\nAs they came closer, first Lucien, and then Basil and Norman, saw\r\nsomething else that puzzled them.  Whenever the swan approached any of\r\nthe ducks, these were observed to disappear under the water.  At first,\r\nthe boys thought that they merely dived to get out of his way, but it\r\nwas not exactly in the same manner as the others were diving for the\r\nroots.  Moreover, none of those that went down in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe swan were seen to come up again!\r\n\r\nThere was something very odd in all this, and the three boys, thinking\r\nso at the same time, were about to communicate their thoughts to one\r\nanother, when the double crack of Francois' gun drove the thing, for a\r\nmoment, out of their heads; and they all looked over the bushes to see\r\nhow many canvass-backs had been killed.  Several were seen dead or\r\nfluttering along the surface; but no one counted them, for a strange,\r\nand even terrible, object now presented itself to the astonished senses\r\nof all.  If the conduct of the swan had been odd before, it was now\r\ndoubly so.  Instead of flying off after the shot, as all expected it\r\nwould do, it was now seen to dance and plunge about on the water,\r\nuttering loud screams, that resembled the human voice far more than any\r\nother sounds!  Then it rose as if pitched into the air, and fell on its\r\nback some distance off; while in its place was seen a dark, round object\r\nmoving through the water, as if making for the bank, and uttering, as it\r\nwent, the same hideous human-like screams!\r\n\r\nThis dark object was no other than the poll of a human being; and the\r\nriver shallowing towards the bank, it rose higher and higher above the\r\nwater, until the boys could distinguish the glistening neck and naked\r\nshoulders of a red and brawny Indian!  All was now explained.  The\r\nIndian had been duck-hunting, and had used the stuffed skin of the swan\r\nas his disguise; and hence the puzzling motions of the bird.  He had not\r\nnoticed the canoe--concealed as it was--until the loud crack of\r\nFrancois' gun had startled him from his work.  This, and the heads and\r\nwhite faces of the boys peeping over the bushes, had frightened him,\r\neven more than he had them.  Perhaps they were the first white faces he\r\nhad ever seen.  But, whether or not, sadly frightened he was; for, on\r\nreaching the bank, he did not stop, but ran off into the woods, howling\r\nand yelling as if Old Nick had been after him: and no doubt he believed\r\nthat such was the case.\r\n\r\nThe travellers picked up the swan-skin out of curiosity; and, in\r\naddition to the ducks which Francois had killed, they found nearly a\r\nscore of these birds, which the Indian had dropped in his fright, and\r\nthat had afterwards risen to the surface.  These were strung together,\r\nand all had their necks broken.\r\n\r\nAfter getting them aboard, the canoe was cleared of the bushes; and the\r\npaddles being once more called into service, the little craft shot\r\ndown-stream like an arrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nTHE DUCKS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nLucien now continued his \"monograph\" of the American ducks.\r\n\r\n\"There are,\" said he, \"more than two dozen species of ducks on the\r\nwaters of North America.  These the systematists have divided into no\r\nless than _eighteen genera_!  Why it would be more easy to learn all\r\nthat ever was known about all the ducks in creation, than to remember\r\nthe eighteen generic names which these gentlemen have invented and put\r\nforward.  Moreover, the habits of any two species of these ducks are\r\nmore similar than those of any two kinds of dogs.  Why then, I should\r\nask--why this complication?  It is true that the ducks do not resemble\r\neach other in every thing.  Some species are fonder of water than\r\nothers.  Some feed entirely upon vegetable substances; others upon small\r\nfish, insects, crustacea, etcetera.  Some live entirely in the sea;\r\nothers make their home in the freshwater lakes and rivers, while many\r\nspecies dwell indifferently, either in salt or fresh waters.  Some love\r\nthe open wave; others the sedgy marsh; while one or two species roost\r\nupon trees, and build their nests in the hollow trunks.  Notwithstanding\r\nall this, there is such a similarity in the appearance and habits of the\r\ndifferent species, that I think the systematists have improved but\r\nlittle, if anything, upon the simple arrangement of the true naturalist\r\nWilson, who--poor Scotch _emigre_ as he was, with an empty purse and a\r\nloaded gun--has collected more original information about the birds of\r\nAmerica than all that have followed him.  He described the ducks of\r\nAmerica under the single genus _Anas_; and, in my opinion, described\r\nthem in a more intelligent and intelligible manner than any one has done\r\nsince his time--not even excepting another great and true naturalist,\r\nwhose career has been longer, more successful, and happier; and whose\r\nfame, in consequence of his better fortune, has become, perhaps, higher\r\nand more extended.\r\n\r\n\"The water-fowl of America,\" continued Lucien--\"I mean the swans, geese,\r\nand ducks, are of great importance in the fur countries where we are now\r\ntravelling.  At certain seasons of the year, in many parts, they furnish\r\nalmost the only article of food that can be procured.  They are all\r\nmigratory--that is, when the lakes and rivers of these regions become\r\nfrozen over in the winter they all migrate southward, but return again\r\nto breed and spend the summer.  They do this, perhaps, because these\r\nwild territories afford them a better security during the season of\r\nincubation, and afterwards of moulting.  It is not very certain,\r\nhowever, that this is the reason, and for my part I am inclined to think\r\nnot, for there are also wild, uninhabited territories enough in southern\r\nlatitudes, and yet they forsake these and migrate north in the spring.\r\n`Their arrival in the fur countries,' writes a distinguished naturalist,\r\n`marks the commencement of spring, and diffuses as much joy among the\r\nwandering hunters of the Arctic regions, as the harvest or vintage\r\nexcites in more genial climes.'  Both by the Indians and hunters in the\r\nemploy of the Hudson's Bay Company swans, geese, and ducks, are\r\nslaughtered by thousands, and are eaten not only when fresh killed, but\r\nthey are salted in large quantities, and so preserved for winter use,\r\nwhen fresh ones can no longer be procured.  Of course, both Indian and\r\nwhite hunters use all their art in killing or capturing them; and to\r\neffect this they employ many different methods, as decoying, snaring,\r\nnetting, and shooting them: but Cousin Norman here could give a better\r\ndescription of all these things than I.  Perhaps he will favour us with\r\nsome account of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Indians,\" said the young trader, taking up the subject without\r\nhesitation, \"usually snare them.  Their most common way is to make a\r\nnumber of hedges or wattle fences projecting into the water at right\r\nangles to the edge of the lake, or, it may be, river.  These fences are\r\ntwo or three yards apart, and between each two there is, of course, an\r\nopening, into which the birds swim, as they make towards the shore for\r\ntheir food.  In these openings, then, the snares are set and tied so\r\nfirmly to a post stuck in the bottom, that the birds, whether ducks,\r\ngeese, or swans, when caught, may not be able to drag it away.  To keep\r\nthe snare in its place, it is secured to the wattles of the fence with\r\ntender strands of grass, that of course give way the moment the fowl\r\nbecomes entangled.  The snares are made out of deer sinews, twisted like\r\npackthread, and sometimes of thongs cut from a `parchment' deerskin,\r\nwhich, as you know, is a deerskin simply dried, and not tanned or\r\ndressed.  The making of the fences is the part that gives most trouble.\r\nSometimes the timber for the stakes is not easily had; and even when it\r\nis plenty, it is no easy matter to drive the stakes into the bottom and\r\nwattle them, while seated in a vessel so crank as a birch canoe.\r\nSometimes, in the rivers where the water-fowl most frequent, the current\r\nis swift, and adds to this trouble.  Where the lakes and rivers are\r\nshallow, the thing becomes easier; and I have seen small lakes and\r\nrivers fenced in this way from shore to shore.  In large lakes this\r\nwould not be necessary, as most of the water-birds--such as the swans\r\nand geese--and all the ducks that are not of the diving kinds, are sure\r\nto come to the shore to feed, and are more likely to be taken close in\r\nto land than out in the open water.\r\n\r\n\"The Indians often snare these birds upon the nest, and they always wash\r\ntheir hands before setting the snare.  They have a notion--I don't know\r\nwhether true or not--that if their hands are not clean, the birds can\r\nsmell the snare, and will be shy of going into it.  They say that all\r\nthese birds--and I believe it's true of all fowls that make their nests\r\nupon the ground--go into the nest at one side, and out at the opposite.\r\nThe Indians knowing this, always set their snares at the side where the\r\nbird enters, and by this they are more sure of catching them, and also\r\nof getting them some hours sooner.\r\n\r\n\"Besides snaring the water-fowl,\" continued Norman, \"the Indians\r\nsometimes catch them in nets, and sometimes on hooks baited with\r\nwhatever the birds are known to eat.  They also shoot them as the white\r\nhunters do, and to get near enough use every sort of cunning that can be\r\nthought of.  Sometimes they decoy them within shot, by putting wooden\r\nducks on the water near their cover, where they themselves are\r\nstationed.  Sometimes they disguise their canoes under brushwood, and\r\npaddle to the edge of the flock; and when the moulting season comes\r\nround, they pursue them through the water, and kill them with sticks.\r\nThe swans, when followed in this way, often escape.  With their strong\r\nwings and great webbed feet, they can flap faster over the surface than\r\na canoe can follow them.  I have heard of many other tricks which the\r\nIndians of different tribes make use of, but I have only seen these ways\r\nI have described, besides the one we have just witnessed.\"\r\n\r\nNorman was one of your practical philosophers, who did not choose to\r\ntalk much of things with which he was not thoroughly acquainted.\r\n\r\nLucien now took up the thread of the conversation, and gave some further\r\ninformation about the different species of American ducks.\r\n\r\n\"One of the most celebrated,\" said he, \"is the `eider-duck' (_Anas\r\nmollissima_).  This is prized for its down, which is exceedingly soft\r\nand fine, and esteemed of great value for lining quilts and making beds\r\nfor the over-luxurious.  It is said that three pounds' weight of `eider\r\ndown' can be compressed to the size of a man's fist, and yet is\r\nafterwards so dilatable as to fill a quilt of five feet square.  The\r\ndown is generally obtained without killing the bird, for that which is\r\nplucked from dead birds is far inferior, and has lost much of its\r\nelasticity.  The mode of procuring it is to steal it from the nest, in\r\nthe absence of the birds.  The female lines the nest with down plucked\r\nfrom her own breast.  When this is stolen from her, by those who gather\r\nthe commodity, she plucks out a second crop of it, and arranges it as\r\nbefore.  This being also removed, it is said that the male bird then\r\nmakes a sacrifice of his downy waistcoat, and the nest is once more put\r\nin order; but should this too be taken, the birds forsake their nest\r\nnever to return to it again.  The quantity of `eider down' found in a\r\nsingle nest is sufficient to fill a man's hat, and yet it will weigh\r\nonly about three ounces.\r\n\r\n\"The eider-duck is about the size of the common mallard, or wild duck\r\nproper.  Its colour is black below, and buff-white on the back, neck,\r\nand shoulders, while the forehead is bluish black.  It is one of the\r\n`sea-ducks,' or _fuligulae_, as the naturalists term them, and it is\r\nrarely seen in fresh water.  Its food is principally the soft mollusca\r\ncommon in the Arctic seas, and its flesh is not esteemed except by the\r\nGreenlanders.  It is at home only in the higher latitudes of both\r\nContinents, and loves to dwell upon the rocky shores of the sea; but in\r\nvery severe winters, it makes its appearance along the Atlantic coast of\r\nthe United States, where it receives different names from the gunners--\r\nsuch as `black-and-white coot,' `big sea-duck,' `shoal-duck,' and\r\n`squaw-duck;' and under these titles it is often sold in the markets of\r\nAmerican cities.  Some suppose that the eider-duck could be easily\r\ndomesticated.  If so, it would, no doubt, prove a profitable as well as\r\nan interesting experiment; but I believe it has already been attempted\r\nwithout success.  It is in the countries of Northern Europe where the\r\ngathering of the eider down has been made an object of industry.  On the\r\nAmerican Continent the pursuit is not followed, either by the native or\r\nwhite settler.\r\n\r\n\"Another species common to the higher latitudes of both Continents is\r\nthe `king-duck,' so called from its very showy appearance.  Its habits\r\nare very similar to the `eider,' and its down is equally soft and\r\nvaluable, but it is a smaller bird.\r\n\r\n\"A still smaller species, also noted for its brilliant plumage, inhabits\r\nthe extreme north of both continents.  This is the `harlequin-duck;' or,\r\nas the early colonists term it, the `lord.'\r\n\r\n\"But the `wood-duck' (_Anas sponsa_) is perhaps the most beautiful of\r\nall the American species, or indeed of all ducks whatever--although it\r\nhas a rival in the _mandarin duck_ of China, which indeed it very much\r\nresembles both in size and markings.  The wood-duck is so called from\r\nthe fact of its making its nest in hollow trees, and roosting\r\noccasionally on the branches.  It is a freshwater duck, and a Southern\r\nspecies--never being seen in very high latitudes; nor is it known in\r\nEurope in a wild state, but is peculiar to the Continent of America.  It\r\nis one of the easiest species to domesticate, and no zoological garden\r\nis now without it; in all of which its small size--being about that of a\r\nwidgeon--its active movements and innocent look, its musical\r\n_peet-peet_, and, above all, its beautiful plumage, make it a general\r\nfavourite.\r\n\r\n\"Besides these, there are many others of the American ducks, whose\r\ndescription would interest you, but you would grow tired were I to give\r\na detailed account of them all; so I shall only mention a few that are\r\ndistinguished by well-known peculiarities.  There is the `whistler'\r\n(_Anas clangula_), which takes its trivial name from the whistling sound\r\nof its wings while in flight; and the `shoveller,' so called from the\r\nform of its bill; and the `conjuring,' or `spirit' ducks of the Indians\r\n(_Anas vulgaris_ and _albeola_), because they dive so quickly and\r\ndexterously, that it is almost impossible to shoot them either with bow\r\nor gun.  There is the `old wife,' or `old squaw' (_Anas glacialis_), so\r\ncalled from its incessant cackle, which the hunters liken to the\r\nscolding of an ill-tempered old wife.  This species is the most noisy of\r\nall the duck tribe, and is called by the voyageurs `caccawee,' from its\r\nfancied utterance of these syllables; and the sound, so often heard in\r\nthe long nights of the fur countries, has been woven into and forms the\r\nburden of many a voyageur's song.  In some parts of the United States\r\nthe caccawee is called `south-southerly,' as its voice is there thought\r\nto resemble this phrase, while at the time when most heard--the autumn--\r\nthese ducks are observed flying in a southerly direction.\r\n\r\n\"Besides these,\" continued Lucien, \"there are the teals--blue and\r\ngreen-winged--and the coots, and the widgeon--slightly differing from\r\nthe widgeon of Europe--and there is the rare and beautiful little ruddy\r\nduck (_Anas rubida_), with its bright mahogany colour--its long upright\r\ntail and short neck--that at a distance give it the appearance of a duck\r\nwith two heads.  And there is the well-known `pintail,' and the\r\n`pochard' or `red-head;' and the `mallard,' from which comes the common\r\ndomestic variety, and the `scoter,' and `surf,' and `velvet,' and\r\n`dusky,' ducks--these last four being all, more or less, of a dark\r\ncolour.  And there are the `shell-drakes,' or `fishers,' that swim low\r\nin the water, dive and fly well, but walk badly, and feed altogether on\r\nfish.  These, on account of their toothed bills, form a genus of\r\nthemselves--the `mergansers,'--and four distinct species of them are\r\nknown in America.\"\r\n\r\nThe approach of night, and the necessity of landing, to make their night\r\ncamp, brought Lucien's lecture to a close.  Indeed Francois was glad\r\nwhen it ended, for he was beginning to think it somewhat tedious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE SHRIKE AND THE HUMMING-BIRDS.\r\n\r\nThe picturesque scenery of the Elk appeared to be a favourite resort\r\nwith the feathered creation.  Here our voyageurs saw many kinds of\r\nbirds; both those that migrate into the fur countries during summer, and\r\nthose that make their home there in the cold, dark days of winter.\r\nAmong the former were observed,--the beautiful blue bird of Wilson\r\n(_Sialia Wilsoni_) which, on account of its gentle and innocent habits,\r\nis quite as much esteemed in America as the \"robin\" in England.  Another\r\nfavourite of the farmer and the homestead, the purple martin, was seen\r\ngracefully wheeling through the air; while, among the green leaves,\r\nfluttered many brilliant birds.  The \"cardinal grosbeak\" (_Pitylus\r\ncardinalis_) with his bright scarlet wings; the blue jay, noisy and\r\nchattering; the rarer \"crossbill\" (_Loxia_) with its deep crimson\r\ncolour; and many others, equally bright and beautiful, enlivened the\r\nwoods, either with their voice or their gaudy plumage.  There was one\r\nbird, however, that had neither \"fine feathers\" nor an agreeable voice,\r\nbut that interested our travellers more than any of the others.  Its\r\nvoice was unpleasant to the ear, and sounded more like the grating of a\r\nrusty hinge than anything else they could think of.  The bird itself was\r\nnot larger than a thrush, of a light grey colour above, white\r\nunderneath, and with blackish wings.  Its bill resembled that of the\r\nhawks, but its legs were more like those of the woodpecker tribe; and it\r\nseemed, in fact, to be a cross between the two.  It was neither the\r\ncolour of the bird, nor its form, nor yet its song, that interested our\r\ntravellers, but its singular habits; and these they had a fine\r\nopportunity of observing at one of their \"noon camps,\" where they had\r\nhalted to rest and refresh themselves during the hot midday hours.  The\r\nplace was on one of the little islets, which was covered with underwood,\r\nwith here and there some larger trees.  The underwood bushes were of\r\nvarious sorts; but close to the spot where they had landed was a large\r\nthicket of honeysuckle, whose flowers were in full bloom, and filled the\r\nair with their sweet perfume.\r\n\r\nWhile seated near these, Francois' quick eye detected the presence of\r\nsome very small birds moving among the blossoms.  They were at once\r\npronounced to be humming-birds, and of that species known as the\r\n\"ruby-throats\" (_Trochilus rolubris_), so called, because a flake of a\r\nbeautiful vinous colour under the throat of the males exhibits, in the\r\nsun, all the glancing glories of the ruby.  The back, or upper parts,\r\nare of a gilded green colour; and the little creature is the smallest\r\nbird that migrates into the fur countries, with one exception, and that\r\nis a bird of the same genus,--the \"cinnamon humming-bird\" (_Trochilus\r\nrufus_).  The latter, however, has been seen in the Northern regions,\r\nonly on the western side of the Rocky Mountains; but then it has been\r\nobserved even as far north as the bleak and inhospitable shores of\r\nNootka Sound.  Mexico, and the tropical countries of America, are the\r\nfavourite home of the humming-birds; and it was, for a long time,\r\nsupposed that the \"ruby-throats\" were the only ones that migrated\r\nfarther north than the territory of Mexico itself.  It is now known,\r\nthat besides the \"cinnamon humming-bird,\" two or three other species\r\nannually make an excursion into higher latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe \"ruby-throats\" not only travel into the fur countries, but breed in\r\nnumbers upon the Elk River, the very place where our travellers now\r\nobserved them.\r\n\r\nAs they sat watching these little creatures, for there were several of\r\nthem skipping about and poising themselves opposite the flowers, the\r\nattention of all was attracted to the movements of a far different sort\r\nof bird.  It was that one we have been speaking of.  It was seated upon\r\na tree, not far from the honeysuckles; but every now and then it would\r\nspring from its perch, dash forward, and after whirring about for some\r\nmoments among the humming-birds, fly back to the same tree.\r\n\r\nAt first the boys watched these manoeuvres without having their\r\ncuriosity excited.  It was no new thing to see birds acting in this\r\nmanner.  The jays, and many other birds of the fly-catching kind\r\n(_Muscicapae_), have this habit, and nothing was thought of it at the\r\nmoment.  Lucien, however, who had watched the bird more narrowly,\r\npresently declared to the rest that it was catching the humming-birds,\r\nand preying upon them--that each time it made a dash among the\r\nhoneysuckles, it carried off one in its claws, the smallness of the\r\nvictim having prevented them at first from noticing this fact.  They all\r\nnow watched it more closely than before, and were soon satisfied of the\r\ntruth of Lucien's assertion, as they saw it seize one of the\r\nruby-throats in the very act of entering the corolla of a flower.  This\r\nexcited the indignation of Francois, who immediately took up his\r\n\"double-barrel,\" and proceeded towards the tree where the bird, as\r\nbefore, had carried this last victim.  The tree was a low one, of the\r\nlocust or _pseud-acacia_ family, and covered all over with great thorny\r\nspikes, like all trees of that tribe.  Francois paid no attention to\r\nthis; but, keeping under shelter of the underwood, he crept forward\r\nuntil within shot.  Then raising his gun, he took aim, and pulling\r\ntrigger, brought the bird fluttering down through the branches.  He\r\nstepped forward and picked it up--not that he cared for such unworthy\r\ngame, but Lucien had called to him to do so, as the naturalist wished to\r\nmake an examination of the creature.  He was about turning to go back to\r\ncamp, when he chanced to glance his eye up into the locust-tree.  There\r\nit was riveted by a sight which caused him to cry out with astonishment.\r\nHis cry brought the rest running up to the spot, and they were not less\r\nastonished than he, when they saw the cause of it.  I have said that the\r\nbranches of the tree were covered with long thorny spikes that pointed\r\nin every direction; but one branch in particular occupied their\r\nattention.  Upon this there were about a dozen of these spines pointing\r\nupward, and upon each spike _was impaled a ruby-throat_!  The little\r\ncreatures were dead, of course, but they were neither torn nor even much\r\nruffled in their plumage.  They were all placed back upwards, and as\r\nneatly spitted upon the thorns as if they had been put there by human\r\nhands.  On looking more closely, it was discovered that other creatures,\r\nas well as the humming-birds, had been served in a similar manner.\r\nSeveral grasshoppers, spiders, and some coleopterous insects were found,\r\nand upon another branch two small meadow-mice (_Arvicolae_) had been\r\ntreated to the same terrible death!\r\n\r\nTo Basil, Norman, and Francois, the thing was quite inexplicable, but\r\nLucien understood well enough what it meant.  All these creatures, he\r\ninformed them, were placed there by the bird which Francois had shot,\r\nand which was no other than the \"shrike\" (_Lanius_) or \"butcher-bird\"--a\r\nname by which it is more familiarly known, and which it receives from\r\nthe very habit they had just observed.  Why it follows such a practice\r\nLucien could not tell, as naturalists are not agreed upon this point.\r\nSome have asserted that it spits the spiders and other insects for the\r\npurpose of attracting nearer the small birds upon which it preys; but\r\nthis cannot be true, for it preys mostly upon birds that are not\r\ninsect-eaters, as the finches: besides, it is itself as fond of eating\r\ngrasshoppers as anything else, and consumes large quantities of these\r\ninsects.  The most probable explanation of the singular and apparently\r\ncruel habit of the butcher-bird is, that it merely places its victims\r\nupon the thorns, in order to keep them safe from ground-ants, rats,\r\nmice, raccoons, foxes, and other preying creatures--just as a good cook\r\nwould hang up her meat or game in the larder to prevent the cats from\r\ncarrying it off.  The thorny tree thus becomes the storehouse of the\r\nshrike, where he hangs up his superfluous spoil for future use, just as\r\nthe crows, magpies, and jays, make their secret deposits in chinks of\r\nwalls and the hollows of trees.  It is no argument against this theory,\r\nthat the shrike sometimes leaves these stores without returning to them.\r\nThe fox, and dog, as well as many other preying creatures, have the\r\nsame habit.\r\n\r\nWondering at what they had seen, the voyageurs returned to their camp,\r\nand once more embarked on their journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nTHE FISH-HAWK.\r\n\r\nA few days after, another incident occurred to our voyageurs, which\r\nillustrated the habits of a very interesting bird, the \"osprey,\" or\r\nfish-hawk, as it is more familiarly known in America.\r\n\r\nThe osprey (_Falco halicetus_) is a bird of the falcon tribe, and one of\r\nthe largest of the genus--measuring two feet from bill to tail, with an\r\nimmense spread of wing in proportion, being nearly six feet from tip to\r\ntip.  It is of a dark-brown colour above, that colour peculiar to most\r\nof the hawk tribe, while its lower parts are ashy white.  Its legs and\r\nbill are blue, and its eyes of a yellow orange.  It is found in nearly\r\nall parts of America, where there are waters containing fish, for on\r\nthese it exclusively feeds.  It is more common on the sea-coast than in\r\nthe interior, although it also frequents the large lakes, and lives in\r\nthe central parts of the continent during summer, when these are no\r\nlonger frozen over.  It is not often seen upon muddy rivers, as there it\r\nwould stand no chance of espying its victims in the water.  It is a\r\nmigratory bird, seeking the South in winter, and especially the shores\r\nof the Great Mexican Gulf, where large numbers are often seen fishing\r\ntogether.  In the spring season these birds move to the northward, and\r\nmake their appearance along the Atlantic coast of the continent, where\r\nthey diffuse joy into the hearts of the fishermen--because the latter\r\nknow, on seeing them, that they may soon expect the large shoals of\r\nherring, shad, and other fish, for which they have been anxiously\r\nlooking out.  So great favourites are they with the fishermen, that they\r\nwould not knowingly kill an osprey for a boat-load of fish, but regard\r\nthese bold fishing birds in the light of \"professional brethren.\"  In\r\nthis case the old adage that \"two of a trade never agree\" is clearly\r\ncontradicted.  The farmer often takes up his gun to fire at the osprey--\r\nmistaking it for the red-tailed buzzard (_Buteo borealis_) or some other\r\nhawk, several species of which at a distance it resembles--but, on\r\ndiscovering his mistake, brings down his piece without pulling trigger,\r\nand lets the osprey fly off unharmed.  This singular conduct on the part\r\nof the farmer arises from his knowledge of the fact, that the osprey\r\nwill not only _not_ kill any of his ducks or hens, but that where he\r\nmakes a settlement he will drive off from the premises all the hawks,\r\nbuzzards, and kites, that would otherwise prey upon the poultry.  With\r\nsuch protection, therefore, the osprey is one of the securest birds in\r\nAmerica.  He may breed in a tree over the farmer's or fisherman's door\r\nwithout the slightest danger of being disturbed in his incubation.  I\r\nsay _his_ incubation; but the male takes no part in this domestic duty,\r\nfurther than to supply his loved mate with plenty of fish while she does\r\nthe hatching business.  Of course, thus protected, the osprey is not a\r\nrare bird.  On the contrary, fish-hawks are more numerous than perhaps\r\nany other species of the hawk tribe.  Twenty or thirty nests may be seen\r\nnear each other in the same piece of woods, and as many as three hundred\r\nhave been counted on one little island.  The nests are built upon large\r\ntrees--not always at the tops, as those of rooks, but often in forks\r\nwithin twenty feet of the ground.  They are composed of large sticks,\r\nwith stalks of corn, weeds, pieces of wet turf, and then lined\r\nplentifully with dry sea-grass, or any other grass that may be most\r\nconvenient.  The whole nest is big enough to make a load for a cart, and\r\nwould be heavy enough to give any horse a good pull.  It can be seen,\r\nwhen the woods are open, to an immense distance, and the more easily, as\r\nthe tree upon which it is built is always a \"dead wood,\" and therefore\r\nwithout leaves to conceal it.  Some say that the birds select a dead or\r\ndecaying tree for their nest.  It is more probable such is the effect,\r\nand not the cause, of their building upon a particular tree.  It is more\r\nlikely that the tree is killed partly by the mass of rubbish thus piled\r\nupon it, and partly by the nature of the substances, such as sea-weed in\r\nthe nest, the oil of the fish, the excrement of the birds themselves,\r\nand the dead fish that have been dropped about the root, and suffered to\r\nremain there; for when the osprey lets fall his finny prey, which he\r\noften does, he never condescends to pick it up again, but goes in search\r\nof another.  Boys \"a-nesting\" might easily discover the nest of the\r\nosprey; but were they inclined to despoil it of its three or four eggs\r\n(which are about the size of a duck's, and blotched with Spanish brown),\r\nthey would find that a less easy task, for the owners would be very\r\nlikely to claw their eyes out, or else scratch the tender skin from\r\ntheir beardless cheeks: so that boys do not often trouble the nest of\r\nthe osprey.  A very curious anecdote is related of a negro having\r\nclimbed up to plunder a nest of these birds.  The negro's head was\r\ncovered with a close nap of his own black wool, which is supposed by a\r\ncertain stretch of fancy to have the peculiarity of \"growing in at both\r\nends.\"  The negro, having no other protection than that which his thick\r\nfur afforded him, was assailed by both the owners of the nest, one of\r\nwhich, making a dash at the \"darkie's\" head, struck his talons so firmly\r\ninto the wool, that he was unable to extricate them, and there stuck\r\nfast, until the astonished plunderer had reached the foot of the tree.\r\nWe shall not answer for the truthfulness of this anecdote, although\r\nthere is nothing improbable about it; for certain it is that these birds\r\ndefend their nests with courage and fury, and we know of more than one\r\ninstance of persons being severely wounded who made the attempt to rob\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe ospreys, as already stated, feed exclusively on fish.  They are not\r\nknown to prey upon birds or quadrupeds of any kind, even when deprived\r\nof their customary food, as they sometimes are for days, on account of\r\nthe lakes and rivers, in which they expected to find it, being frozen\r\nover to a later season than usual.  Other birds, as the purple grakles,\r\noften build among the sticks of the osprey's nest, and rear their young\r\nwithout being meddled with by this generous bird.  This is an important\r\npoint of difference between the osprey and other kinds of hawks; and\r\nthere is a peculiarity of structure about the feet and legs of the\r\nosprey, that points to the nature of his food and his mode of procuring\r\nit.  His legs are disproportionately long and strong.  They are without\r\nfeathers nearly to the knees.  The feet and toes are also very long, and\r\nthe soles are covered with thick, hard scales, like the teeth of a rasp,\r\nwhich enable the bird to hold securely his slippery prey.  The claws,\r\ntoo, are long, and curved into semicircles, with points upon them almost\r\nas sharp as needles.\r\n\r\nI have stated that an incident occurred to our party that illustrated\r\nsome of the habits of this interesting bird.  It was upon the afternoon\r\nof a Saturday, after they had fixed their camp to remain for the\r\nfollowing day.  They had landed upon a point or promontory that ran out\r\ninto the river, and from which they commanded a view of a fine stretch\r\nof water.  Near where they had placed their tent was the nest of an\r\nosprey, in the forks of a large poplar.  The tree, as usual, was dead,\r\nand the young were plainly visible over the edge of the nest.  They\r\nappeared to be full-grown and feathered; but it is a peculiarity of the\r\nyoung ospreys that they will remain in the nest, and be fed by the\r\nparent birds, until long after they might be considered able to shift\r\nfor themselves.  It is even asserted that the latter become impatient at\r\nlength, and drive the young ones out of the nest by beating them with\r\ntheir wings; but that for a considerable time afterwards they continue\r\nto feed them--most likely until the young birds learn to capture their\r\nfinny prey for themselves.\r\n\r\nThis Lucien gave as a popular statement, but did not vouch for its\r\ntruth.  It was not long, however, before both he and his companions\r\nwitnessed its complete verification.\r\n\r\nThe old birds, after the arrival of the voyageurs upon the promontory,\r\nhad remained for some time around the nest, and at intervals had shot\r\ndown to where the party was, uttering loud screams, and making the air\r\nwhizz with the strokes of their wings.  Seeing that there was no\r\nintention of disturbing them, they at length desisted from these\r\ndemonstrations, and sat for a good while quietly upon the edge of their\r\nnest.  Then first one, and shortly after the other, flew out, and\r\ncommenced sailing in circles, at the height of an hundred feet or so\r\nabove the water.  Nothing could be more graceful than their flight.  Now\r\nthey would poise themselves a moment in the air, then turn their bodies\r\nas if on a pivot, and glide off in another direction.  All these motions\r\nwere carried on with the most perfect ease, and as if without the\r\nslightest aid from the wings.  Again they would come to a pause, holding\r\nthemselves fixed in mid-air by a gentle flapping, and appearing to\r\nscrutinise some object below.  Perhaps it was a fish; but it was either\r\ntoo large a one, or not the species most relished, or maybe it had sunk\r\nto too great a depth to be easily taken.  Again they sail around; one of\r\nthem suddenly arrests its flight, and, like a stone projected from a\r\nsling, shoots down to the water.  Before reaching the surface, however,\r\nthe fish, whose quick eye has detected the coming enemy, has gone to the\r\ndark bottom, and concealed himself; and the osprey, suddenly checking\r\nhimself by his wings and the spread of his full tail, mounts again, and\r\nre-commences his curvilinear flight.\r\n\r\nAfter this had gone on for some time, one of the birds--the larger one,\r\nand therefore the female--was seen to leave off hunting, and return to\r\nthe nest.  There she sat only for a few seconds, when, to the\r\nastonishment of the boys, she began to strike her wings against the\r\nyoung ones, as if she was endeavouring to force them from the nest.\r\nThis was just what she designed doing.  Perhaps her late unsuccessful\r\nattempt to get them a fish had led her to a train of reflections, and\r\nsharpened her determination to make them shift for themselves.  However\r\nthat may be, in a few moments she succeeded in driving them up to the\r\nedge, and then, by half pushing, and half beating them with her wings,\r\none after the other--two of them there were--was seen to take wing, and\r\nsoar away out over the lake.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the male shot down upon the water, and then rose again\r\ninto the air, bearing a fish, head-foremost, in his talons.  He flew\r\ndirectly towards one of the young, and meeting it as it hovered in the\r\nair, turned suddenly over, and held out the fish to it.  The latter\r\nclutched it with as much ease as if it had been accustomed to the thing\r\nfor years, and then turning away, carried the fish to a neighbouring\r\ntree, and commenced devouring it.  The action had been perceived by the\r\nother youngster, who followed after, and alighted upon the same branch,\r\nwith the intention of sharing in the meal.  In a few minutes, the best\r\npart of the fish was eaten up, and both, rising from the branch, flew\r\nback to their nest.  There they were met by the parents, and welcomed\r\nwith a loud squeaking, that was intended, no doubt, to congratulate them\r\nupon the success of their first \"fly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE OSPREY AND HIS TYRANT.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining for some time on the nest along with the others, the old\r\nmale again resolved to \"go a-fishing,\" and with this intent he shot out\r\nfrom the tree, and commenced wheeling above the water.  The boys, having\r\nnothing better to engage them, sat watching his motions, while they\r\nfreely conversed about his habits and other points in his natural\r\nhistory.  Lucien informed them that the osprey is a bird common to both\r\nContinents, and that it is often seen upon the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, pursuing the finny tribes there, just as it does in\r\nAmerica.  In some parts of Italy it is called the \"leaden eagle,\"\r\nbecause its sudden heavy plunge upon the water is fancied to resemble\r\nthe falling of a piece of lead.\r\n\r\nWhile they were discoursing, the osprey was seen to dip once or twice\r\ntowards the surface of the water, and then suddenly check himself, and\r\nmount upward again.  These manoeuvres were no doubt caused by the fish\r\nwhich he intended to \"hook\" having suddenly shifted their quarters.\r\nMost probably experience had taught them wisdom, and they knew the\r\nosprey as their most terrible enemy.  But they were not to escape him at\r\nall times.  As the boys watched the bird, he was seen to poise himself\r\nfor an instant in the air, then suddenly closing his wings, he shot\r\nvertically downward.  So rapid was his descent, that the eye could only\r\ntrace it like a bolt of lightning.  There was a sharp whizzing sound in\r\nthe air--a plash was heard--then the smooth bosom of the water was seen\r\nto break, and the white spray rose several feet above the surface.  For\r\nan instant the bird was no longer seen.  He was underneath, and the\r\nplace of his descent was marked by a patch of foam.  Only a single\r\nmoment was he out of sight.  The next he emerged, and a few strokes of\r\nhis broad wing carried him into the air, while a large fish was seen\r\ngriped in his claws.  As the voyageurs had before noticed, the fish was\r\ncarried head-foremost, and this led them to the conclusion that in\r\nstriking his prey beneath the water the osprey follows it and aims his\r\nblow from behind.\r\n\r\nAfter mounting a short distance the bird paused for a moment in the air,\r\nand gave himself a shake, precisely as a dog would do after coming out\r\nof water.  He then directed his flight, now somewhat slow and heavy,\r\ntoward the nest.  On reaching the tree, however, there appeared to be\r\nsome mismanagement.  The fish caught among the branches as he flew\r\ninward.  Perhaps the presence of the camp had distracted his attention,\r\nand rendered him less careful.  At all events, the prey was seen to drop\r\nfrom his talons; and bounding from branch to branch, went tumbling down\r\nto the bottom of the tree.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more opportune than this, for Francois had not been\r\nable to get a \"nibble\" during the whole day, and a fresh fish for dinner\r\nwas very desirable to all.  Francois and Basil had both started to their\r\nfeet, in order to secure the fish before the osprey should pounce down\r\nand pick it up; but Lucien assured them that they, need be in no hurry\r\nabout that, as the bird would not touch it again after he had once let\r\nit fall.  Hearing this, they took their time about it, and walked\r\nleisurely up to the tree, where they found the fish lying.  After taking\r\nit up they were fain to escape from the spot, for the effluvium arising\r\nfrom a mass of other fish that lay in a decomposed state around the tree\r\nwas more than any delicate pair of nostrils could endure.  The one they\r\nhad secured proved to be a very fine salmon of not less than six pounds\r\nweight, and therefore much heavier than the bird itself!  The track of\r\nthe osprey's talons was deeply marked; and by the direction in which the\r\ncreature was scored, it was evident the bird had seized it from behind.\r\nThe old hawks made a considerable noise while the fish was being carried\r\naway; but they soon gave up their squealing, and, once more hovering out\r\nover the river, sailed about with their eyes bent upon the water below.\r\n\r\n\"What a number of fish they must kill!\" said Francois.  \"They don't\r\nappear to have much difficulty about it.  I should think they get as\r\nmuch as they can eat.  See! there again!  Another, I declare!\"\r\n\r\nAs Francois spake the male osprey was seen to shoot down as before, and\r\nthis time, although he appeared scarcely to dip his foot in the water,\r\nrose up with a fish in his talons.\r\n\r\n\"They have sometimes others to provide for besides themselves,\" remarked\r\nLucien.  \"For instance, the bald eagle--\"\r\n\r\nLucien was interrupted by a cackling scream, which was at once\r\nrecognised as that of the very bird whose name had just escaped his\r\nlips.  All eyes were instantly turned in the direction whence it came--\r\nwhich was from the opposite side of the river--and there, just in the\r\nact of launching itself from the top of a tall tree, was the great enemy\r\nof the osprey--the white-headed eagle himself!\r\n\r\n\"Now a chase!\" cried Francois, \"yonder comes the big robber!\"\r\n\r\nWith some excitement of feeling, the whole party watched the movements\r\nof the birds.  A few strokes of the eagle's wing brought him near; but\r\nthe osprey had already heard his scream, and knowing it was no use\r\ncarrying the fish to his nest, turned away from it, and rose spirally\r\nupward, in the hope of escaping in that direction.  The eagle followed,\r\nbeating the air with his broad pinions, as he soared after.  Close\r\nbehind him went the female osprey, uttering wild screams, flapping her\r\nwings against his very beak, and endeavouring to distract his attention\r\nfrom the chase.  It was to no purpose, however, as the eagle full well\r\nknew her object, and disregarding her impotent attempts, kept on in\r\nsteady flight after her mate.  This continued until the birds had\r\nreached a high elevation, and the ospreys, from their less bulk, were\r\nnearly out of sight.  But the voyageurs could see that the eagle was on\r\nthe point of overtaking the one that carried the fish.  Presently, a\r\nglittering object dropped down from the heavens, and fell with a plunge\r\nupon the water.  It was the fish, and almost at the same instant was\r\nheard the \"whish!\" of the eagle, as the great bird shot after it.\r\nBefore reaching the surface, however, his white tail and wings were seen\r\nto spread suddenly, checking his downward course; and then, with a\r\nscream of disappointment, he flew off in a horizontal direction, and\r\nalit upon the same tree from which he had taken his departure.  In a\r\nminute after the ospreys came shooting down, in a diagonal line, to\r\ntheir nest; and, having arrived there, a loud and apparently angry\r\nconsultation was carried on for some time, in which the young birds bore\r\nas noisy a part as either of their parents.\r\n\r\n\"It's a wonder,\" said Lucien, \"the eagle missed the fish--he rarely\r\ndoes.  The impetus which he can give his body enables him to overtake a\r\nfalling object before it can reach the earth.  Perhaps the female osprey\r\nwas in his way, and hindered him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why did he not pick it up in the water?\" demanded Francois.\r\n\r\n\"Because it went to the bottom, and he could not reach it--that's\r\nclear.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Basil who made answer, and the reason he assigned was the true\r\none.\r\n\r\n\"It's too bad,\" said Francois, \"that the osprey, not half so big a bird,\r\nmust support this great robber-tyrant by his industry.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no worse than among our own kind,\" interposed Basil.  \"See how the\r\nwhite man makes the black one work for him here in America.  That,\r\nhowever, is the _few_ toiling for the _million_.  In Europe the case is\r\nreversed.  There, in every country, you see the million toiling for the\r\nfew--toiling to support an oligarchy in luxurious ease, or a monarch in\r\nbarbaric splendour.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why do they do so? the fools!\" asked Francois, somewhat angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Because they know no better.  That oligarchy, and those monarchs, have\r\ntaken precious care to educate and train them to the belief that such is\r\nthe _natural_ state of man.  They furnish them with school-books, which\r\nare filled with beautiful sophisms--all tending to inculcate principles\r\nof endurance of wrong, and reverence for their wrongers.  They fill\r\ntheir rude throats with hurrah songs that paint false patriotism in\r\nglowing colours, making loyalty--no matter to whatsoever despot--the\r\ngreatest of virtues, and revolution the greatest of crimes; they\r\nstudiously divide their subjects into several creeds, and then, playing\r\nupon the worst of all passions--the passion of religious bigotry--easily\r\nprevent their misguided helots from uniting upon any point which would\r\ngive them a real reform.  Ah! it is a terrible game which the present\r\nrulers of Europe are playing!\"\r\n\r\nIt was Basil who gave utterance to these sentiments, for the young\r\nrepublican of Louisiana had already begun to think strongly on political\r\nsubjects.  No doubt Basil would one day be an M.C.\r\n\r\n\"The bald eagles have been much blamed for their treatment of the\r\nospreys, but,\" said Lucien, \"perhaps they have more reason for levying\r\ntheir tax than at first appears.  It has been asked: Why they do not\r\ncapture the fish themselves?  Now, I apprehend, that there is a\r\n_natural_ reason why they do not.  As you have seen, the fish are not\r\nalways caught upon the surface.  The osprey has often to plunge beneath\r\nthe water in the pursuit, and Nature has gifted him with power to do so,\r\nwhich, if I am not mistaken, she has denied to the eagles.  The latter\r\nare therefore compelled, in some measure, to depend upon the former for\r\na supply.  But the eagles sometimes do catch the fish themselves, when\r\nthe water is sufficiently shallow, or when their prey comes near enough\r\nto the surface to enable them to seize it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they ever kill the ospreys?\" inquired Francois.\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" replied Lucien; \"that would be `killing the goose,'\r\netcetera.  They know the value of their tax-payers too well to get rid\r\nof them in that way.  A band of ospreys, in a place where there happens\r\nto be many of them together, have been known to unite and drive the\r\neagles off.  That, I suppose, must be looked upon in the light of a\r\nsuccessful _revolution_.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation was here interrupted by another incident.  The ospreys\r\nhad again gone out fishing, and, at this moment, one of them was seen to\r\npounce down and take a fish from the water.  It was a large fish, and,\r\nas the bird flew heavily upward, the eagle again left its perch, and\r\ngave chase.  This time the osprey was overtaken before it had got two\r\nhundred yards into the air, and seeing it was no use attempting to carry\r\noff the prey, it opened its claws and let it drop.  The eagle turned\r\nsuddenly, poised himself a moment, and then shot after the falling fish.\r\nBefore the latter had got near the ground, he overtook and secured it\r\nin his talons.  Then, arresting his own flight by the sudden spread of\r\nhis tail, he winged his way silently across the river, and disappeared\r\namong the trees upon the opposite side.  The osprey, taking the thing as\r\na matter of course, again descended to the proper elevation, and betook\r\nhimself to his work.  Perhaps he grinned a little like many another\r\nroyal tax-payer, but he knew the tax had to be paid all the same, and he\r\nsaid nothing.\r\n\r\nAn incident soon after occurred that astonished and puzzled our party\r\nnot a little.  The female osprey, that all this time seemed to have had\r\nbut poor success in her fishing, was now seen to descend with a rush,\r\nand plunge deeply into the wave.  The spray rose in a little cloud over\r\nthe spot, and all sat watching with eager eyes to witness the result.\r\nWhat was their astonishment when, after waiting many seconds, the bird\r\nstill remained under water!  Minutes passed, and still she did not come\r\nup.  _She came up no more_!  The foam she had made in her descent\r\nfloated away--the bosom of the water was smooth as glass--not a ripple\r\ndisturbed its surface.  They could have seen the smallest object for a\r\nhundred yards or more around the spot where she had disappeared.  It was\r\nimpossible she could have emerged without them seeing her.  Where, then,\r\nhad she gone?  This, as I have said, puzzled the whole party; and formed\r\na subject of conjecture and conversation for the rest of that day, and\r\nalso upon the next.  Even Lucien was unable to solve the mystery.  It\r\nwas a point in the natural history of the osprey unknown to him.  Could\r\nshe have drowned herself?  Had some great fish, the \"gar pike,\" or some\r\nsuch creature, got hold of and swallowed her?  Had she dashed her head\r\nagainst a rock, or become entangled in weeds at the bottom of the river?\r\n\r\nAll these questions were put, and various solutions of the problem were\r\noffered.  The true one was not thought of, until accident revealed it.\r\nIt was Saturday when the incident occurred.  The party, of course,\r\nremained all next day at the place.  They heard almost continually the\r\ncry of the bereaved bird, who most likely knew no more than they what\r\nhad become of his mate.  On Monday our travellers re-embarked and\r\ncontinued down-stream.  About a mile below, as they were paddling along,\r\ntheir attention was drawn to a singular object floating upon the water.\r\nThey brought the canoe alongside it.  It was a large fish, a sturgeon,\r\nfloating dead, with a bird beside it, also dead!  On turning both over,\r\nwhat was their astonishment to see that the talons of the bird were\r\nfirmly fixed in the back of the fish!  It was the _female osprey_!  This\r\nexplained all.  She had struck a fish too heavy for her strength, and\r\nbeing unable to clear her claws again, had been drawn under the water\r\nand had perished along with her victim!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGE INTERRUPTED.\r\n\r\nAbout ten days' rapid travelling down the Elk River brought our party\r\ninto the Athabasca Lake--sometimes called the \"Lake of the Hills.\"  This\r\nis another of those great bodies of fresh water that lie between the\r\nprimitive rocks of the \"Barren Grounds,\" and the more fertile limestone\r\ndeposit upon the west.  It is nearly two hundred miles long from west to\r\neast, and is only fifteen miles in breadth, but in some places it is so\r\nnarrow and full of islands that it looks more like a broad river than a\r\nlake.  Its shores and many of its islands are thickly wooded,\r\nparticularly upon the southern and western edges; and the eye of the\r\ntraveller is delighted with many a beautiful vista as he passes along.\r\nBut our voyageurs took little heed of these things.  A gloom had come\r\nover their spirits, for one of their party had taken ill, and was\r\nsuffering from a painful and dangerous disease--an intermittent fever.\r\nIt was Lucien--he that was beloved by all of them.  He had been\r\ncomplaining for several days--even while admiring the fair scenery of\r\nthe romantic Elk--but every day he had been getting worse, until, on\r\ntheir arrival at the lake, he declared himself no longer able to travel.\r\nIt became necessary, therefore, to suspend their journey; and choosing\r\na place for their camp, they made arrangements to remain until Lucien\r\nshould recover.  They built a small log-hut for the invalid, and did\r\neverything to make him as comfortable as possible.  The best skins were\r\nspread for his couch; and cooling drinks were brewed for him from roots,\r\nfruits, and berries, in the way he had already taught his companions to\r\nprepare them.  Every day Francois went forth with his gun, and returned\r\nwith a pair of young pigeons, or a wood-partridge, or a brace of the\r\nbeautiful ruffed grouse; and out of these he would make delicate soups,\r\nwhich he was the better able to do as they had procured salt, pepper,\r\nand other ingredients, at the Fort.  They had also brought with them a\r\nstock of tea--the real China tea--and sugar; and as the quantity of both\r\nwas but small, this luxurious beverage was made exclusively for Lucien,\r\nand was found by him exceedingly beneficial during his illness.\r\n\r\nTo the great joy of all the invalid was at length restored to health,\r\nand the canoe being once more launched and freighted, they continued\r\ntheir journey.\r\n\r\nThey coasted along the shores of the lake, and entered the Great Slave\r\nRiver, which runs from the Athabasca into the Great Slave Lake.  They\r\nsoon came to the mouth of another large river, called the Peace.  This\r\nruns into the Great Slave a short distance below Lake Athabasca, and,\r\nstrange to say, the sources of the Peace River lie upon the _western_\r\nside of the Rocky Mountains, so that this stream actually runs across\r\nthe mountain-chain!  It passes through the mountains in a succession of\r\ndeep gorges, which are terrible to behold.  On both sides dizzy cliffs\r\nand snow-capped peaks rise thousands of feet above its rocky bed, and\r\nthe scenery is cold and desolate.  Its head-waters interlock with those\r\nof several streams that run into the Pacific; so that, had our voyageurs\r\nwished to travel to the shores of that ocean, they might have done so in\r\ntheir birch-bark canoe nearly the whole of the way.  But this was not\r\ntheir design at present, so they passed the _debouchure_ of the Peace,\r\nand kept on for the Great Slave Lake.  They were still upon the same\r\nwater as the Elk, for the Great Slave is only another name for that part\r\nof the river lying between the two lakes--Athabasca and Great Slave.  Of\r\ncourse the river had now become much larger by the influx of the Peace,\r\nand they were travelling upon the bosom of a magnificent stream, with\r\nvaried scenery upon its banks.  They were not so happy, however, as when\r\ndescending the Elk--not but that they were all in good health, for\r\nLucien had grown quite strong again.  No, it was not any want of health\r\nthat rendered them less cheerful.  It was the prospect before them--the\r\nprospect of coming winter, which they now felt certain would arrive\r\nbefore they had got to the end of their journey.  The delay of nearly a\r\nmonth, occasioned by Lucien's illness, had deranged all their\r\ncalculations; and they had no longer any hope of being able to finish\r\ntheir voyage in what remained of the short summer.  The ice would soon\r\nmake its appearance; the lakes and rivers would be frozen up; they could\r\nno longer navigate them in their canoe.  To travel afoot would be a most\r\nlaborious undertaking, as well as perilous in an extreme degree.  In\r\nthis way it is only possible to carry a very small quantity of\r\nprovisions--for the traveller is compelled to load himself with\r\nskin-clothing in order to keep out the cold.  The chances of procuring\r\ngame by the way in that season are precarious, and not to be depended\r\nupon.  Most of the birds and many of the quadrupeds migrate to more\r\nsouthern regions; and those that remain are shy and rare.  Besides,\r\ngreat snow-storms are to be encountered, in which the traveller is in\r\ndanger of getting \"smoored.\"  The earth is buried under a deep covering\r\nof snow, and to pass over this while soft is difficult, and at times\r\nquite impossible.  All these circumstances were known to our young\r\nvoyageurs--to Norman better than any of them--and of course the prospect\r\nwas a cheerless one--much more so than those unacquainted with the\r\nwinter of these dreary regions would be willing to believe.\r\n\r\nIt was the month of August, near its end, when they reached the Great\r\nSlave Lake, in the latitude of 62 degrees.  The days had now become very\r\nshort, and their journeys grew short in proportion.  They already\r\nexperienced weather as cold as an English winter.  There were slight\r\nfrosts at night--though not yet enough to cover the water with ice--and\r\nthe midday hours were hot, sometimes too hot to be comfortable.  But\r\nthis only caused them to feel the cold the more sensibly when evening\r\nset in; and all their robes and skins were necessary to keep them warm\r\nduring the night.\r\n\r\nThe Great Slave Lake, like the Athabasca, is very long and very narrow.\r\nIt extends full 260 miles from east to west, but at its widest part is\r\nnot over thirty, and in some places much less.  Along its northern\r\nshores lies the edge of the \"Barren Grounds,\" and there nothing meets\r\nthe eye but bleak and naked hills of primitive rock.  On its southern\r\nside the geology is entirely of a different character.  There the\r\nlimestone prevails, and scarcely anything that deserves the name of hill\r\nis to be seen.  There are fine forests too, in which poplars, pines, and\r\nbirches, are the principal trees.  The lake is filled with islands, many\r\nof which are wholly or partially covered with timber of these kinds, and\r\nwillows also are abundant.  There are fish of several species in its\r\nwaters, which are in many places of great depth--sixty fathoms deep--and\r\nin some of the islands, and around the wooded shores, game exists in\r\nabundance in the summer season.  Even in winter it is not scarce, but\r\nthen it is difficult to follow it on account of the deep snow.  Many of\r\nthe animals, too, at this season become torpid, and are of course hidden\r\nin caves and hollow trees, and even in the snow itself, where no one can\r\nfind them.  Notwithstanding all this, our voyageurs knew that it would\r\nbe the best place for them to make their winter camp.  They saw that to\r\ncomplete their journey during that season would be impossible.  Even had\r\nit been a month earlier it would have been a difficult undertaking.  In\r\na few days winter would be upon them.  They would have to stop\r\nsomewhere.  There was no place where they could so safely stay as by the\r\nlake.  One thing they would have there, which might not be found so\r\nplenty elsewhere, that was wood for their fire; and this was an\r\ninducement to remain by the lake.  Having made up their minds,\r\ntherefore, to encamp on some part of it, they looked from day to day for\r\na place that would be most suitable, still continuing their journey\r\ntowards its western end.  As yet no place appeared to their liking, and\r\nas the lake near its western point trends away towards the south, Norman\r\nproposed that they should follow the shore no longer, but strike across\r\nto a promontory on the northern shore of the lake, known as \"Slave\r\nPoint.\"  This promontory is of the limestone formation, and as Norman\r\nhad heard, is well wooded, and stocked with game.  Even buffaloes are\r\nfound there.  It is, in fact, the farthest point to the north-east that\r\nthese animals range, and this presents us with a curious fact.  It is\r\nthe farthest point that the limestone deposit extends in that direction.\r\nBeyond that, to the east and north, lie the primitive rocks of the\r\nBarren Grounds, into which the buffaloes never stray.  Thus we observe\r\nthe connexion that exists between the _fauna_ of a country and its\r\ngeological character.\r\n\r\nOf course they all agreed to Norman's proposal.  The canoe was,\r\ntherefore, headed for the open waters; and, after a hard day's\r\npaddling--for there was a head-wind--the voyageurs landed upon a small\r\nwooded island, about halfway over the lake, where they encamped for the\r\nnight, intending next day to cross the remaining part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nFISHING UNDER THE ICE.\r\n\r\nOn awaking next morning, to their great surprise, they saw that the\r\n_lake was frozen over_!  They had almost anticipated as much, for the\r\nnight was one of the coldest they had yet experienced--so cold that one\r\nand all of them had slept but badly.  As yet the ice was thin, but so\r\nmuch the worse.  It was thick enough to prevent them from using the\r\ncanoe, but too thin to bear their weight, and they now saw that they\r\nwere _prisoners upon the island_!\r\n\r\nIt was not without some feelings of alarm that they made this discovery;\r\nbut their fears were allayed by reflecting, that they could remain upon\r\nthe island until the ice either thawed away or became strong enough to\r\nbear them, and then they could cross upon it to the northern shore.\r\n\r\nWith this consolation, therefore, they set about making their temporary\r\nquarters upon the island as snug as circumstances would permit.  Their\r\napprehensions, however, began to return again, when several days had\r\npassed over, and the ice neither grew any thinner nor any thicker, but\r\nseemed to remain at a standstill.  In the early part of the morning it\r\nwas almost strong enough to bear them; but during the day the sun melted\r\nit, until it was little better than a scum over the surface of the\r\nwater.  The alarm of our voyageurs increased.  Their provisions were\r\nnearly out.  There was no game on the islet--not so much as a bird--for\r\nthey had beaten every bush, and found nothing.  Once or twice they\r\nthought of launching their canoe and breaking a way for it through the\r\nice.  But they knew that this proceeding would be one of much labour as\r\nwell as danger.  The islet was full ten miles from the shore, and they\r\nwould therefore have to break the ice for ten miles.  Moreover, to stand\r\nup in a bark canoe, so as to get at the work, would be a difficult task.\r\nIt could not be accomplished without endangering the equilibrium of the\r\nvessel, and indeed without upsetting it altogether.  Even to lean\r\nforward in the bow would be a perilous experiment; and under these\r\nconsiderations the idea of breaking a way was abandoned.  But their\r\nprovisions were at length entirely exhausted, and what was to be done?\r\nThe ice was still too weak to carry them.  Near the shore it might have\r\nbeen strong enough, but farther out lay the danger.  There they knew it\r\nwas thinner, for it had not frozen over until a later period.  It would\r\nhave been madness to have risked it yet.  On the other hand, they were\r\nstarving, or likely to starve from hunger, by staying where they were.\r\nThere was nothing eatable on the island.  What was to be done?  In the\r\nwater were fish--they doubted not that--but how were they to catch them?\r\nThey had tried them with hook and line, letting the hook through a hole\r\nin the ice; but at that late season the fish would not take a bait, and\r\nalthough they kept several continually set, and \"looked\" them most\r\nregularly and assiduously, not a \"tail\" was taken.\r\n\r\nThey were about to adopt the desperate expedient, now more difficult\r\nthan ever, of breaking their way through the ice, when, all at once, it\r\noccurred to Norman, that, if they could not coax the fish to take a\r\nbait, they might succeed better with a net, and capture them against\r\ntheir will.  This idea would have been plausible enough, had there been\r\na net; but there was no net on that islet, nor perhaps within an hundred\r\nmiles of it.  The absence of a net might have been an obstacle to those\r\nwho are ever ready to despair; but such an obstacle never occurred to\r\nour courageous boys.  They had two _parchment_ skins of the caribou\r\nwhich they had lately killed, and out of these Norman proposed to make a\r\nnet.  He would soon do it, he said, if the others would set to work and\r\ncut the deerskins into thongs fine enough for the purpose.  Two of them,\r\ntherefore, Basil and Lucien, took out their knives, and went briskly to\r\nwork; while Francois assisted Norman in twining the thongs, and\r\nafterwards held them, while the latter wove and knotted them into\r\nmeshes.  In a few hours both the skins were cut into fine strips, and\r\nworked up; and a net was produced nearly six yards in length by at least\r\ntwo in width.  It was rude enough, to be sure, but perhaps it would do\r\nits work as well as if it had been twined out of silk.  At all events,\r\nit was soon to have a trial--for the moment it was finished the sinkers\r\nwere attached to it, and it was carried down to the edge of the water.\r\n\r\nThe three \"Southerners\" had never seen a net set under ice--for in their\r\ncountry ice is an uncommon thing, and indeed never freezes of sufficient\r\nthickness to carry the weight of a man.  They were therefore very\r\ncurious to know how the thing was to be done.  They could not conceive\r\nhow the net was to be stretched under the ice, in such a manner as to\r\ncatch the fish.  Norman, however, knew all about it.  He had seen the\r\nIndians, and had set many a one himself.  It was no new thing for him,\r\nand he set about it at once.\r\n\r\nHe first crept out upon the ice to the distance of about twenty or\r\nthirty yards from the shore.  He proceeded cautiously, as the ice\r\ncreaked under him.  Having arrived at the place where he intended to set\r\nthe net, he knelt down, and with his knife cut several holes in the ice,\r\nat the distance of about six feet from each other, and all in one line.\r\nHe had already provided himself with a straight sapling of more than six\r\nfeet in length, to one end of which he had attached a cord.  The other\r\nend of this cord was tied to the net, at one of its corners.  He now\r\nthrust the sapling through the first hole he had made, and then guided\r\nit so as to pass directly under the second.  At this hole he took a\r\nfresh hold of the stick, and passed it along to the next, and so on to\r\nthe last, where he pulled it out again, and of course along with it the\r\nstring.  The net was now drawn into the first hole, and by means of the\r\ncord already received through, was pulled out to its full length.  The\r\nsinkers, of course, fell down in the water, and drew it into a vertical\r\nposition.  At both its upper corners the net was made fast above the\r\nice, and was now \"set.\"  Nothing more could be done until the fish came\r\ninto it of their own accord, when it could be drawn out upon the ice by\r\nmeans of the cord attached; and, of course, by the same means could\r\neasily be returned to its place, and set again.\r\n\r\nAll of them now went back to the fire, and with hungry looks sat around\r\nit, waiting the result.  They had made up their minds, should no fish be\r\ncaught, to get once more into the canoe and attempt breaking their way\r\nto the shore.  Summoning all their patience, therefore, they waited for\r\nnearly two hours, without examining the net.  Then Norman and Basil\r\ncrawled back upon the ice, to see what fortune had done for them.  They\r\napproached the spot, and, with their hearts thumping against their ribs,\r\nuntied the knot, and commenced hauling out.\r\n\r\n\"It certainly feels heavy,\" said Basil, as he net was being drawn.\r\n\"Hurrah!\" he shouted, \"Something kicks, hurrah!\" and with the second\r\n\"hurrah!\" a beautiful fish was pulled up through the hole, and landed\r\nupon the ice.  A loud \"hurrah\" was uttered in response by Lucien and\r\nFrancois--who, fearing the ice might not bear so many, had remained upon\r\nthe shore.  A yard or two more of the net was cleared, and a second fish\r\nstill larger than the former was greeted with a general \"hurrah!\"  The\r\ntwo fish were now taken out--as these were all that had been caught--and\r\nthe net was once more carefully set.  Basil and Norman came back to the\r\nshore--Norman to receive quite a shower of compliments from his\r\ncompanions.  The fish--the largest of which weighed nearly five pounds--\r\nproved to be trout; and it was not long before their quality was put to\r\nthe proof.  All declared they had never eaten so fine trout in their\r\nlives; but when the condition of their appetites is taken into account,\r\nwe may infer that there was, perhaps, a little exaggeration in this\r\nstatement.  If hunger really makes good sauce, our voyageurs had the\r\nbest of sauce with their fish, as each of them was as hungry as a\r\nhalf-famished wolf.\r\n\r\nThey felt quite relieved, as far as present appetite went, but they were\r\nstill uneasy for the future.  Should they not succeed in taking more\r\nfish--and it was by no means certain they should succeed--they would be\r\nno better off than ever.  Their anxiety, however, was soon removed.\r\nTheir second \"haul\" proved even more successful than the first--as five\r\nfish, weighing together not less than twenty pounds, were pulled up.\r\n\r\nThis supply would enable them to hold out for a long time, but they had\r\nnot much longer to remain on the islet.  Upon that very night there was\r\none of those severe frosts known only in high latitudes, and the ice\r\nupon the lake became nearly a foot in thickness.  They had no longer any\r\nfear of its breaking under their weight; and taking their canoe with all\r\ntheir \"traps,\" they set out to cross over upon the ice.  In a few hours\r\nthey reached the shore of the lake, near the end of the promontory,\r\nwhere they chose a spot, and encamped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nAN ODD ALARM.\r\n\r\nThe first thing our voyageurs did after choosing a suitable situation,\r\nwas to build a log-hut.  Being young backwoodsmen this was but a trifle\r\nto them.  All four of them knew how to handle an axe with dexterity.\r\nThe logs were soon cut and notched, and a small cabin was put up, and\r\nroofed with split clap-boards.  With the stones that lay near the shore\r\nof the lake they built a chimney.  It was but a rude structure, but it\r\ndrew admirably.  Clay was wanted to \"chink\" the cabin, but that could\r\nnot be had, as the ground was hard frozen, and it was quite impossible\r\nto make either clay or mud.  Even hot water poured out would freeze into\r\nice in a few minutes.  This was a serious want--for in such a cold\r\nclimate even the smallest hole in the walls will keep a house\r\nuncomfortable, and to fill the interstices between the logs, so as to\r\nmake them air-tight, some soft substance was necessary.  Grass was\r\nsuggested, and Lucien went off in search of it.  After a while he\r\nreturned with an armful of half-withered grass, which all agreed would\r\nbe the very thing; and a large quantity was soon collected, as it grew\r\nplentifully at a short distance from the cabin.\r\n\r\nThey now set to work to stuff it into the chinks; when, to their\r\nastonishment, they found that this grass had a beautiful smell, quite as\r\npowerful and as pleasant as that of mint or thyme!  When a small\r\nquantity of it was flung into the fire it filled the cabin with a\r\nfragrance as agreeable as the costliest perfumes.  It was the \"scented\r\ngrass,\" which grows in great profusion in many parts of the Hudson's Bay\r\nterritory, and out of which the Indians often make their beds, burning\r\nit also upon the fire to enjoy its aromatic perfume.\r\n\r\nFor the first day or two, at their new abode, the travellers had lived\r\naltogether on fish.  They had, of course, brought their net with them\r\nfrom the island, and had set it near the shore in the same way as\r\nbefore.  They had captured as many as they wanted, and, strange to say,\r\nat one haul they found no less than five different species in the net!\r\nOne kind, a white fish, the _Coregonus albus_ of naturalists, but which\r\nis named \"tittameg\" by the fur-traders, they caught in great plenty.\r\nThis fish is found in nearly all the lakes and rivers of the Hudson's\r\nBay territory, and is much prized both by whites and Indians for its\r\ndelicate flavour.  At some of the trading posts it often forms, for\r\nweeks together, the only food which the residents can obtain; and they\r\nare quite satisfied when they can get enough of it.  The tittameg is not\r\na large fish; the largest attain to the weight of about eight pounds.\r\n\r\nThere was another and still smaller species, which, from its colour, the\r\nvoyageurs call the \"poisson bleu,\" or blue fish.  It is the _Coregonus\r\nsignifer_ of ichthyologists.  It is a species of grayling, and frequents\r\nsharp-running water, where it will leap at the fly like a trout.\r\nSeveral kinds of trout also inhabit the Great Slave Lake, and some of\r\nthese attain to the enormous weight of eighty pounds!  A few were\r\ncaught, but none of so gigantic proportions as this.  Pike were also\r\ntaken in the net, and a species of burbot (_Gadus lota_).  This last is\r\none of the most voracious of the finny tribe, and preys upon all others\r\nthat it is able to swallow.  It devours whole quantities of cray-fish,\r\nuntil its stomach becomes crammed to such a degree as to distort the\r\nshape of its whole body.  When this kind was drawn out, it was treated\r\nvery rudely by the boys--because its flesh was known to be extremely\r\nunsavoury, and none of them cared to eat it.  Marengo, however, had no\r\nsuch scruples, and he was wont to make several hearty meals each day\r\nupon the rejected burbot.\r\n\r\nA fish diet exclusively was not the thing; and as our party soon grew\r\ntired of it, the hunter Basil shouldered his rifle, and strode off into\r\nthe woods in search of game.  The others remained working upon the\r\ncabin, which was still far from being finished.\r\n\r\nBasil kept along the edge of the lake in an easterly direction.  He had\r\nnot gone more than a quarter of a mile, when he came upon a dry gravelly\r\nridge, which was thickly covered with a species of pine-trees that\r\nresembled the Scotch fir (_Pinus sylvestris_).  These trees were not\r\nover forty feet in height, with very thick trunks and long flexible\r\nbranches.  No other trees grew among them, for it is the nature of this\r\npine--which was the \"scrub\" or grey pine (_Pinus Banksiana)_ to\r\nmonopolise the ground wherever it grows.  As Basil passed on, he noticed\r\nthat many of the trees were completely \"barked,\" particularly on the\r\nbranches; and small pieces of the bark lay scattered over the ground, as\r\nthough it had been peeled off and gnawed by some animal.  He was walking\r\nquietly on and thinking what creature could have made such a wreck, when\r\nhe came to a place where the ground was covered with fine sand or dust.\r\nIn this, to his astonishment, he observed what he supposed to be the\r\ntracks of human feet!  They were not those of a man, but small tracks,\r\nresembling the footsteps of a child of three or four years of age.  He\r\nwas about stooping down to examine them more closely, when a voice\r\nsounded in his ears exactly like the cry of a child!  This brought him\r\nsuddenly to an erect attitude again, and he looked all round to discover\r\nwho or what had uttered that strange cry.  He could see no one--child or\r\nman--and strange, too, for he had a clear view through the tree-trunks\r\nfor several hundred yards around.  He was filled with curiosity, not\r\nunmixed with alarm; and, stepping forward a few paces, he was about to\r\nbend down and examine the tracks a second time, when the singular cry\r\nagain startled him.  This time it was louder than before, as if he was\r\ncloser to whatever had uttered it, but Basil now perceived that it\r\nproceeded from above him.  The creature from which it came was certainly\r\nnot upon the ground, but high up among the tops of the trees.  He looked\r\nup, and there, in the fork of one of the pines, he perceived a singular\r\nand hideous-looking animal--such as he had never before seen.  It was of\r\na brown colour, about the size of a terrier-dog, with thick shaggy hair,\r\nand clumped up in the fork of the tree--so that its head and feet were\r\nscarcely distinguishable.  Its odd appearance, as well as the peculiar\r\ncry which it had uttered, would have alarmed many a one of less courage\r\nthan our young hunter, and Basil was at first, as he afterwards\r\nconfessed, \"slightly flurried;\" but a moment's reflection told him what\r\nthe animal was--one of the most innocent and inoffensive of God's\r\ncreatures--the Canada porcupine.  It was this, then, that had barked the\r\nscrub-pines--for they are its favourite food; and it was its track--\r\nwhich in reality very much resembles that of a child--that Basil had\r\nseen in the sand.\r\n\r\nThe first thought of the young hunter was to throw up his rifle, and\r\nsend a bullet through the ungainly animal; which, instead of making any\r\neffort to escape, remained almost motionless, uttering, at intervals,\r\nits child-like screams.  Basil, however, reflected that the report of\r\nhis rifle would frighten any large game that might chance to be near;\r\nand as the porcupine was hardly worth a shot, he concluded, upon\r\nreflection, it would be better to leave it alone.  He knew--for he had\r\nheard Lucien say so--that he would find the porcupine at any time, were\r\nit a week, or even a month after--for these creatures remain sometimes a\r\nwhole winter in the same grove.  He resolved, therefore, should no other\r\ngame turn up, to return for it; and, shouldering his rifle again, he\r\ncontinued his course through the woods.\r\n\r\nAs he proceeded, the timber became thinner.  The scrub-pines gave place\r\nto poplar-trees, with here and there an undergrowth of willows.  The\r\ntrees stood far apart, and the willows grew only in clumps or \"islands,\"\r\nso that the view was nearly open for many hundred yards around.  Basil\r\nwalked on with all the silence and watchfulness of a true \"still\"\r\nhunter--for, among backwoodsmen, this species of hunting is so called.\r\nHe ascended a low hill, and keeping a tree in front of him, looked\r\ncautiously over its crest.  Before him, and stretching from the bottom\r\nof the hill, was a level tract of considerable extent.  It was bounded\r\non one side by the edge of the lake, and on all the others by thin\r\nwoods, similar to those through which the hunter had been for some time\r\ntravelling.  Here and there, over the plain, there stood trees, far\r\napart from each other, and in nowise intercepting the view for a mile or\r\nmore.  The ground was clear of underwood, except along the immediate\r\nedge of the lake, which was fringed by a thicket of willows.\r\n\r\nAs Basil looked over the hill, he espied a small group of animals near\r\nthe interior border of the willows.  He had never seen animals of the\r\nsame species before, but the genus was easily told.  The tall antlered\r\nhorns, that rose upon the head of one of them, showed that they were\r\ndeer of some kind; and the immense size of the creature that bore them,\r\ntogether with his ungainly form, his long legs, and ass-like ears, his\r\nhuge head with its overhanging lip, his short neck with its standing\r\nmane, and, above all, the broad palmation of the horns themselves, left\r\nBasil without any doubt upon his mind that the animals before him were\r\nmoose-deer--the largest, and perhaps the most awkward, of all the deer\r\nkind.  The one with the antlers was the male or bull-moose.  The others\r\nwere the female and her two calves of the preceding year.  The latter\r\nwere still but half-grown, and, like the female, were without the\r\n\"branching horns\" that adorned the head of the old bull.  They were all\r\nof a dark-brown colour--looking blackish in the distance--but the large\r\none was darker than any of the others.\r\n\r\nBasil's heart beat high, for he had often heard of the great moose, but\r\nnow saw it for the first time.  In his own country it is not found, as\r\nit is peculiarly a creature of the cold regions, and ranges no farther\r\nto the south than the northern edge of the United States territory.  To\r\nthe north it is met with as far as timber grows--even to the shores of\r\nthe Polar Sea!  Naturalists are not certain, whether or not it be the\r\nsame animal with the elk (_Cervus alces_) of Europe.  Certainly the two\r\nare but little, if anything, different; but the name \"elk\" has been\r\ngiven in America to quite another and smaller species of deer--the\r\nwapiti (_Cervus Canadensis_).  The moose takes its name from its Indian\r\nappellation, \"moosoa,\" or \"wood-eater;\" and this name is very\r\nappropriate, as the animal lives mostly upon the leaves and twigs of\r\ntrees.  In fact, its structure--like that of the camelopard--is such\r\nthat it finds great difficulty in reaching grass, or any other herbage,\r\nexcept where the latter chances to be very tall, or grows upon the\r\ndeclivity of a very steep hill.  When it wishes to feed upon grass, the\r\nmoose usually seeks it in such situations; and it may often be seen\r\nbrowsing up the side of a hill, with its legs spread widely on both\r\nsides of its neck.  But its favourite food is found at a more convenient\r\nheight, and consists of the young shoots of many species of trees.  It\r\nprefers those of the poplar, the birch-tree, and willows, and one kind\r\nof these last, the red willow, is its particular favourite.  The\r\n\"striped\" maple (_Acer striatum_) is also much relished by the moose--\r\nhence the name \"moose-wood,\" by which this tree is known among the\r\nhunters.  It loves also the common water-lilies (_Nympha_); and in\r\nsummer it may be seen wading out into lakes, and plucking up their\r\nsucculent leaves.  It takes to the water also for other purposes--to\r\ncool its body, and rid itself of several species of gnats and mosquitoes\r\nthat at this season torment it exceedingly.  At such times it is more\r\neasily approached; and the Indians hunt it in their canoes, and kill it\r\nin the water, both with spears and arrows.  They never find the moose,\r\nhowever, in large numbers--for it is a solitary animal, and only\r\nassociates in pairs during one part of the year, and in families at\r\nanother season--as Basil now found it.  In winter the Indians track it\r\nthrough the snow, following it upon snow-shoes.  These give them the\r\nadvantage of skimming along the surface, while the moose plunges through\r\nthe deep drift, and is therefore impeded in its flight.\r\nNotwithstanding, it will frequently escape from the hunter, after a\r\n_chase of several days' duration_!  Sometimes, in deep snow, a dozen or\r\nmore of these animals will be found in one place, where they have got\r\naccidentally together.  The snow will be trodden down until the place\r\nappears as if enclosed by a wall.  This the hunters term a\r\n\"moose-pound,\" and when found in such situations the moose are easily\r\napproached and surrounded--when a general _battue_ takes place, in which\r\nfew or none of the animals are allowed to escape.\r\n\r\nI have said that Basil's heart beat high at the sight of the moose.  He\r\nwas very desirous of killing one--partly on account of the novelty of\r\nthe thing, and partly because he and his companions at the camp were\r\nanxious for a change of diet.  Moose-meat was the very thing; and he\r\nknew that if he could return to camp with a few pieces of this strung\r\nover his gun, he would receive a double welcome.  He was well aware that\r\nthe flesh of the moose was of the most savoury and delicate kind, and\r\nthat the long pendulous upper lip is one of the \"tit-bits\" of the fur\r\ncountries.  Moreover, the fine hide would be an acceptable addition to\r\ntheir stock, as it is the best of all deerskins for mocassins, as well\r\nas snow-shoes--articles which Basil knew would soon be needed.  For\r\nthese reasons he was unusually desirous of killing one of the moose.\r\n\r\nHe knew it would be difficult to approach them.  He had heard that they\r\nwere shyest at that very season--the beginning of winter--and indeed\r\nsuch is the case.  No deer is so difficult to get a shot at as a moose\r\nin early winter.  In summer it is not so--as then the mosquitoes torment\r\nthese animals to such a degree that they pay less heed to other enemies,\r\nand the hunter can more easily approach them.  In winter they are always\r\non the alert.  Their sense of smell--as well as of sight and hearing--is\r\nacute to an extreme degree, and they are cunning besides.  They can\r\nscent an enemy a long distance off--if the wind be in their favour--and\r\nthe snapping of a twig, or the slightest rustle of the leaves, is\r\nsufficient to start them off.  In their journeyings through the snow,\r\nwhen they wish to rest themselves, they make a sort of _detour_, and,\r\ncoming back, lie down near the track which they have already passed\r\nover.  This gives them an opportunity of hearing any enemy that may be\r\nfollowing upon their trail, and also of making off in a side-direction,\r\nwhile the latter will be looking steadfastly ahead for them.\r\n\r\nBasil had heard of all these tricks of the moose--for many an old\r\nmoose-hunter had poured his tale into Basil's ear.  He proceeded,\r\ntherefore, with all due caution.  He first buried his hand in his\r\ngame-bag, and after a little groping brought out a downy feather which\r\nhad chanced to be there.  This he placed lightly upon the muzzle of his\r\nrifle, and having gently elevated the piece above his head, watched the\r\nfeather.  After a moment, the breeze carried it off, and Basil noted the\r\ndirection it took.  This is called, in hunter phrase, \"tossing the\r\nfeather,\" and gave Basil the exact direction of the wind--an important\r\nknowledge in the present case.  To Basil's gratification he saw that it\r\nwas blowing down the lake, and nearly towards himself.  He was not\r\nexactly to leeward of the moose; but, what was better still, the willows\r\nthat fringed the lake were, for he could see them bending from the deer,\r\nas the breeze blew freshly.  He knew he could easily get among the\r\nwillows; and as they were not yet quite leafless, and, moreover, were\r\ninterspersed with tall reed-grass, they formed a tolerable cover under\r\nwhich he might make his approach.\r\n\r\nWithout losing time, then, he made for the willows, and placing them\r\nbetween himself and the game, commenced \"approaching\" along the shore of\r\nthe lake.\r\n\r\nHe had a full half-hour's creeping--at one time upon his hands and\r\nknees--at another, crawling flat upon his breast like a gigantic lizard,\r\nand now and then, at favourable spots, walking in a bent attitude.  A\r\nfull half-hour was he, and much pain and patience did it cost him,\r\nbefore getting within shot.  But Basil was a hunter, and knew both how\r\nto endure the pain and practise the patience--virtues that, in hunting\r\nas well as in many other occupations, usually meet with their reward.\r\nAnd Basil was likely to meet with his, for on parting the leaves, and\r\nlooking cautiously through, he saw that he had arrived at the right\r\nspot.  Within fifty yards of him he saw the high shoulders of the\r\nbull-moose and his great flat antlers towering over the tops of the\r\nwillows, among the leaves of which the snout of the animal was buried.\r\nHe also caught a glimpse of parts of the other three beyond; but he\r\nthought only of the bull, and it was upon him that he kept his eyes\r\nfixed.  Basil did not think of the quality of the meat, else he would\r\nhave selected either the cow or one of the calves.  Had it been\r\nbuffaloes he would certainly have done so; but as he had never killed a\r\nmoose, he was determined to slay the leader of the herd.\r\n\r\nIndeed, had he wished to shoot one of the others, it might not have been\r\nso easy, as they were farther off, and he could only see the tops of\r\ntheir shoulders over the willows.  Neither did the bull offer a fair\r\nmark.  He stood face to face with the hunter, and Basil fancied that a\r\nshot on the frontal bone might not kill him.  He knew it would not kill\r\na buffalo.  There was only one other part at which he could aim--the\r\nfore-shoulder; and after waiting some moments for the animal to give him\r\na fairer chance, he took aim at this and fired.  He heard a loud\r\ncracking of hoofs, as the cow and calves shambled off over the plain,\r\nbut he saw that the bull was not with them.  He was down behind the\r\nwillows.  No doubt he was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nENCOUNTER WITH A MOOSE.\r\n\r\nWhat was a rare thing for Basil to do, he rushed forward without\r\nreloading his gun.  A few springs brought him into the open ground, and\r\nin presence of the game.  To his astonishment, the bull was not dead,\r\nnor down neither, but only upon his knees--of course wounded.  Basil saw\r\nthe \"crease\" of the bullet along the neck of the animal as he drew near.\r\nIt was only by a quick glance that he saw this, for as soon as the bull\r\nsaw him he rose to his full height--his eyes flashing like a tiger's--\r\nand setting his antlers in a forward position, sprang upon the hunter!\r\nBasil leaped aside to avoid the encounter; and in the first rush was\r\nsuccessful, but the animal turned suddenly, and, coming up a second\r\ntime, raised his fore-feet high in the air, and struck forward with his\r\nlong-pointed hoofs.  Basil attempted to defend himself with his rifle,\r\nbut the piece was struck out of his hand in an instant.  Once more\r\navoiding the forward rush of the infuriated beast, the young hunter\r\nlooked around for some object to save him.  A tree fell under his eye,\r\nand he ran towards it with all his speed.  The moose followed close upon\r\nhis heels, and he had just time to reach the tree and get around its\r\ntrunk, when the animal brushed past, tearing the bark with his sharp\r\nantlers.  Basil now slipped round the trunk, and when the moose again\r\nturned himself the two were on opposite sides of the tree!  The beast,\r\nhowever, rushed up, and struck the tree furiously first with his brow\r\nantlers, and then with his hoofs, uttering loud snorts, and at intervals\r\na shrill whistling sound that was terrible to hear.  The disappointment\r\nwhich the enraged animal felt, at seeing his enemy thus escape him,\r\nseemed to have added to his rage; and he now vented his spite upon the\r\ntree, until the trunk, to the height of six feet, was completely\r\nstripped of its bark.  While this was going on, Basil remained behind\r\nthe tree, \"dodging\" round as the moose manoeuvred, and taking care\r\nalways to have the animal on the opposite side.  To have got into a\r\nsafer situation he would have climbed the tree; but it happened to be a\r\npoplar, without a branch for many feet from the ground, and of too great\r\na girth to be \"embraced.\"  He could do nothing, therefore, but remain\r\nupon the ground, and keep the tree-trunk between himself and the bull.\r\n\r\nFor nearly an hour this lasted, the moose now remaining at rest for a\r\nfew minutes, and then making fresh onsets that seemed to abate nothing\r\nin their fury.  His rage appeared to be implacable, and his vengeance as\r\ntenacious as that of a tiger or any other beast of prey.  The wound\r\nwhich the hunter had given him was no doubt painful, and kept his\r\nresentment from cooling.  Unfortunately, it was not a mortal wound, as\r\nBasil had every opportunity of seeing.  The bullet had hit the\r\nfore-shoulder; but, after tearing along the skin, had glanced off\r\nwithout injuring the bone.  It had only enraged the bull, without\r\ncrippling him in the least degree.  Basil began to dread the result.  He\r\nwas becoming faint with fatigue as well as hunger.  When would he be\r\nrelieved?  When would the fierce brute feel inclined to leave him?\r\nThese were questions which the hunter put to himself repeatedly, without\r\nbeing able to divine an answer.  He had heard of hunters being killed by\r\nwounded moose.  He had heard that these creatures will remain for days\r\nwatching a person whom they may have \"treed.\"  He could not stand it for\r\ndays.  He would drop down with fatigue, and then the bull would gore and\r\ntrample him at pleasure.  Would they be able to trace him from the camp?\r\nThey would not think of that before nightfall.  They would not think of\r\nhim as \"lost\" before that time; and then they could not follow his trail\r\nin the darkness, nor even in the light--for the ground was hard as a\r\nrock, and he had made no footmarks.  Marengo might trace him.  The dog\r\nhad been left at the camp, as Basil preferred \"still-hunting\" without\r\nhim.  But in his present situation the hunter's apprehensions were\r\nstronger than his hopes.  Even Marengo might be baffled in lifting the\r\nscent.  The trail was an exceedingly devious one, for Basil had\r\nmeandered round the sides of the hill in search of game.  Deer or other\r\nanimals might have since crossed it, which might mislead the hound.  It\r\nwould be cold at night, and much colder next morning.  There were many\r\nchances that no relief might reach him from the camp.  Impressed with\r\nthis conviction, Basil began to feel serious alarm.  Not despair,\r\nhowever--he was not the boy to despair.  His mind only grew more alive\r\nto the necessity for action.  He looked around to discover some means of\r\nescape.  His gun lay not a hundred yards off.  Could he only get hold of\r\nthe piece, and return safely to the tree again, he could there load it\r\nand put at end to the scene at once.  But to reach the gun was\r\nimpossible.  The moose would bound after and overtake him to a\r\ncertainty.  The idea of getting the gun was abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn the opposite direction to that in which the gun lay, Basil perceived\r\nthat there were other trees.  The nearest was but a dozen yards from\r\nhim; and others, again, grew at about the same distance from that one,\r\nand from each other.  Basil now conceived the idea of escaping to the\r\nnearest, and from that to the next, and by this means getting back into\r\nthe thick forest.  Once there, he believed that he would be the better\r\nable to effect his escape, and perhaps reach the camp by dodging from\r\ntree to tree.  He could beat the moose for a dozen yards--getting a\r\nlittle the start of him--and this he hoped to be able to do.  Should he\r\nfail in his short race, however--should his foot slip--the alternative\r\nwas fearful.  _It was no other than death_!\r\n\r\nHe knew that, but it did not change his resolution to make the attempt.\r\nHe only waited for the animal to work round between him and the tree\r\ntowards which he intended to run.  You will wonder that he did not\r\nprefer to have the moose on the other side.  But he did not, for this\r\nreason--had the bull been there, he could have sprung after him at the\r\nfirst start; whereas, when heading the other way, Basil believed he\r\ncould brush close past, and gain an advantage, as the unwieldy brute,\r\ntaken by surprise, would require some time in turning himself to give\r\nchase.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity at length arrived; and nerving himself for the race, the\r\nhunter sprang past the moose, brushing the very tips of its antlers.  He\r\nran without either stopping or even looking back, until he had reached\r\nthe tree, and sheltered himself behind its trunk.  The moose had\r\nfollowed, and arrived but the moment after, snorting and whistling\r\nfuriously.  Enraged at the _ruse_, it attacked this tree, as it had the\r\nother, with hoof and horns; and Basil nimbly evaded both by keeping on\r\nthe opposite side, as before.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes he prepared himself for a second rush, and once more\r\nstarted.  A third tree was reached in safety--and then a fourth, and a\r\nfifth, and many others, in a similar manner--the moose all the while\r\nfollowing in hot pursuit.  Basil had begun to hope that in this way he\r\nwould get off, when, to his chagrin, he saw that an open space still\r\nintervened between him and the thick woods, upon which there were only a\r\nfew trees, and those so small that not one of them would have sheltered\r\nhim.  This tract was full two hundred yards in width, and extended all\r\nalong the edge of the thick forest.  He dared not cross it.  The moose\r\nwould overtake him before he could get half the way; and he was obliged\r\nto give up the idea of making the attempt.\r\n\r\nAs he stood behind the last tree he had reached, he saw that it\r\nbranched, and the lowest branches grew but a little above his head.  He\r\ncould easily climb it, and at once resolved to do so.  He would there be\r\nsafe for the time, and could at least rest himself, for he was now weak\r\nwith fatigue.  He, therefore, stretched up his hands, and, laying hold\r\nof a branch, swung himself up into the tree.  Then climbing up a little\r\nhigher, he sat down on one of the forks.\r\n\r\nThe moose appeared as furious as ever; and ran round the tree, now\r\nstriking it with his horns, and then rearing upon his hind-legs, and\r\npouncing against the trunk with his hoofs.  At times his snout was so\r\nclose to Basil, that the latter could almost touch it; and he had even\r\ndrawn his hunting-knife, and reached down with the intent of giving the\r\ncreature a stab.\r\n\r\nThis last action led to a train of thought, and Basil seemed suddenly to\r\nadopt some new resolution.  Leaving the fork where he had perched\r\nhimself, he climbed higher up the tree; and, selecting one of the\r\nlongest and straightest branches, commenced cutting it off close to the\r\ntrunk.  This was soon effected; and then, drawing it along his knee, he\r\ntrimmed off all the twigs and tops until the branch became a straight\r\npole, like a spear-handle.  Along one end of this he laid the handle of\r\nhis knife; and with thongs, which he had already cut out of the strap of\r\nhis bullet-pouch, he spliced the knife and pole together.  This gave him\r\na formidable weapon--for the knife was a \"bowie,\" and had a long blade,\r\nwith a point like a rapier.  He was not slow in using it.  Descending\r\nagain to the lowermost limbs, he commenced making demonstrations, in\r\norder to bring the moose within reach.  This he very soon succeeded in\r\ndoing; and the animal ran forward and reared up against the tree.\r\nBefore it could get upon its four legs again, Basil had thrust it in the\r\nneck, giving full force to the blow.  The blood rushed forth in a thick\r\nstream, as the jugular vein had been cut by the keen blade; and the huge\r\nbrute was seen to totter in its steps, and then fall with a dull heavy\r\nsound to the earth.  In a few moments the hunter had the satisfaction of\r\nperceiving that it was quite dead.\r\n\r\nBasil now dropped out of the tree, and walking back to where his rifle\r\nlay, took up the piece and carefully reloaded it.  He then returned to\r\nthe moose, and opening the great jaws of the animal, gagged them with a\r\nstick.  He next unspliced his knife, took off the gristly lips, and cut\r\nout the tongue.  These he placed in his game-bag, and shouldering his\r\nrifle, was about to depart; when some new idea caused him to halt, put\r\ndown his gun, and again unsheath his knife.  Once more approaching the\r\ncarcass, he made an incision near the kidneys; and having inserted his\r\nhand, drew forth what appeared to be a part of the intestines.  It was\r\nthe bladder.  He then looked around as if in search of something.\r\nPresently his eye rested upon some tall reed-grass that was growing\r\nnear.  This was just what he wanted, and, pulling up one of the stems,\r\nhe cut and fashioned it into a pipe.  With this the moose-bladder was\r\nblown out to its full dimensions, and tied at the neck by a piece of\r\nthong.  The other end of the thong was fastened to one of the branches\r\nof the tree above, so that the bladder dangled within a few feet of the\r\ncarcass of the moose, dancing about with the lightest breath of wind.\r\nAll these precautions Basil had taken to keep the wolves from devouring\r\nthe moose--for it was his intention to return and butcher it, as soon as\r\nhe could get help.  When he had hung the bladder to his liking, he put\r\nup his knife again; and, once more shouldering his rifle, walked off.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the camp--which he did shortly after--the tongue of the\r\nmoose was broiled without delay, and, after making a delicious meal of\r\nit, the whole party went off for the remainder of the meat.  They found\r\nit all quite safe; although, had it not been for the bladder, not much\r\nof it would have been there--as no less than a dozen great gaunt wolves\r\nwere seen lurking about, and these would have eaten it up in the\r\nshortest possible time.  The bladder, however, had kept them off; for,\r\nstrange to say, these creatures, who are as cunning as foxes, and can\r\nhardly be trapped, can yet be deceived and frightened by such a simple\r\nthing as a bladder dangling from a branch.\r\n\r\nThe moose proved to be one of the largest of his kind.  His height was\r\nquite equal to that of a horse; and his horns, flattened out to the\r\nbreadth of shovels, weighed over sixty pounds.  His carcass was not less\r\nthan fifteen hundred pounds weight; and our voyageurs had to make two\r\njourneys to convey the meat to their camp.  On the last journey,\r\nFrancois brought the porcupine as well--having found it on the very same\r\ntree where Basil had left it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nLIFE IN A LOG-HUT.\r\n\r\nThe log-hut was finished on the 1st of September, and not a day too\r\nsoon; for on that very day the winter set in with full severity.  A\r\nheavy fall of snow came down in the night; and next morning, when our\r\nvoyageurs looked abroad, the ground was covered to the depth of a foot,\r\nor more; and the ice upon the lake was also white.  Walking through the\r\ngreat wreaths now became very difficult; and the next thing to be done\r\nwas the making of \"snow-shoes.\"\r\n\r\nSnow-shoes are an invention of the Indians; and, in the winter of the\r\nArctic regions of America, are an article almost as indispensable as\r\nclothing itself.  Without them, travelling afoot would be impossible.\r\nIn these countries, as already stated, the snow often covers the ground\r\nto the depth of many feet; and remains without any considerable\r\ndiminution for six, and, in some years, eight or nine months.  At times,\r\nit is frozen hard enough on the surface to bear a man without the\r\nsnow-shoes; but oftener on account of thaws and fresh falls, it becomes\r\nquite soft, and at such times travelling over it is both difficult and\r\ndangerous.  To avoid both the difficulty and the danger, the Indians\r\nmake use of this _very_ singular sort of foot-wear--called \"snow-shoes\"\r\nby the English, and \"raquets\" by the Canadian voyageurs.  They are used\r\nby all the Indian tribes of the Hudson's Bay territory; and were it not\r\nfor them these people would be confined to one place for months\r\ntogether, and could not follow the deer or other game.  As almost all\r\nsavages are improvident, and none more so than the North American\r\nIndians, were they prevented for a season from going out to hunt, whole\r\ntribes would starve.  Indeed, many individuals of them perish with\r\nhunger as it is; and the life of all these Indians is nothing more than\r\none continued struggle for food enough to sustain them.  In summer they\r\nare often in the midst of plenty; slaughtering deer and buffalo by\r\nhundreds, taking out only the tongues, and recklessly leaving the flesh\r\nto the wolves!  In winter the very same Indians may be seen without a\r\npound of meat in their encampment--the lives of themselves and their\r\nfamilies depending upon the success of a single day's hunt!\r\n\r\nBut let us return to the snow-shoes.  Let us see what they are, and\r\nlearn how they are made.\r\n\r\nAny boy who has snared sparrows in snow-time, has, no doubt, done so by\r\ntying his snares upon a hoop netted across with twine or other small\r\ncord.  Now, if he will conceive his hoop bent into an oblong shape--\r\nsomething like what the figure of a boat turned on its mouth would make\r\nin snow--and if he will also fancy the netting to consist of thongs of\r\ntwisted deer-hide woven somewhat closely together, he will get a very\r\ngood idea of an Indian snow-shoe.  It is usually from three to four feet\r\nlong, by about a foot wide at the middle part, from which it tapers\r\ngently to a point, both at the heel and toe.  The frame, as I have said,\r\nis like the hoop of a boy's bird-snare.  It is made of light, tough\r\nwood, and, of course, carefully bent and polished with the knife.  The\r\nslender branches of the \"scrub-pine\" (_Pinus Banksiana_) are esteemed\r\nexcellent for this purpose, as their wood is light, flexible and tough\r\nin its fibres.  This is also a favourite tree, where it grows, to make\r\ntent-poles, canoe-timbers, and other implements required by the Indians;\r\nand these people use so much of it for their arrows, that it has\r\nreceived from the Canadian voyageurs the name of _bois de fleche_\r\n(arrow-wood).\r\n\r\nWell, then, the frame of the snow-shoes being bent to its proper shape,\r\ntwo transverse bars are placed across near the middle, and several\r\ninches from each other.  They are for the foot to rest upon, as well as\r\nto give strength to the whole structure.  These being made fast, the\r\nnetting is woven on, and extends over the whole frame, with the\r\nexception of a little space in front of the bars where the ball of the\r\nfoot is to rest.  This space is left free of netting, in order to allow\r\nplay to the toes while walking.  The mesh-work is made of thongs usually\r\ncut from the parchment-skin of a deer, and twisted.  Sometimes twisted\r\nintestines are used, and the netting exactly resembles that seen in\r\n\"racquets\" for ball play.\r\n\r\nThe snow-shoe, when finished, is simply fastened upon the foot by means\r\nof straps or thongs; and a pair of them thus placed, will present a\r\nsurface to the snow of nearly six square feet--more, if required, by\r\nmaking them larger.  But this is enough to sustain the heaviest man upon\r\nthe softest snow, and an Indian thus \"shod\" will skim over the surface\r\nlike a skater.\r\n\r\nThe shoes used by all tribes of Indians are not alike in shape.  There\r\nare fashions and fancies in this respect.  Some are made--as among the\r\nChippewa Indians--with one side of the frame nearly straight; and these,\r\nof course, will not do for either foot, but are \"rights and lefts.\"\r\nGenerally, however, the shape is such that the snow-shoe will fit either\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nThe snow-shoes having now become a necessary thing, our young voyageurs\r\nset about making a complete set for the whole party--that is, no less\r\nthan four pairs.  Norman was the \"shoemaker,\" and Norman knew how.  He\r\ncould splice the frames, and work in the netting, equal to an Indian\r\nsquaw.  Of course all the others assisted him.  Lucien cut the\r\nmoose-skin into fine regular strips; Basil waded off through the snow,\r\nand procured the frames from the wood of the scrub-pine-trees where he\r\nhad encountered the porcupine; and then he and Francois trimmed them\r\nwith their knives, and sweated them in the hot ashes until they became\r\ndry, and ready for the hands of the \"shoemaker.\"\r\n\r\nThis work occupied them several days, and then each had a pair of shoes\r\nfitted to his size and weight.\r\n\r\nThe next consideration was, to lay in a stock of meat.  The moose had\r\nfurnished them with enough for present use, but that would not last\r\nlong, as there was no bread nor anything else to eat with it.  Persons\r\nin their situation require a great deal of meat to sustain them, much\r\nmore than those who live in great cities, who eat a variety of\r\nsubstances, and drink many kinds of drinks.  The healthy voyageur is\r\nrarely without a keen appetite; and meat by itself is a food that\r\nspeedily digests, and makes way for a fresh meal; so that the ration\r\nusually allowed to the _employes_ of the fur companies would appear\r\nlarge enough to supply the table of several families.  For instance, in\r\nsome parts of the Hudson's Bay territory, the voyageur is allowed eight\r\npounds of buffalo-meat _per diem_!  And yet it is all eaten by him, and\r\nsometimes deemed barely sufficient.  A single deer, therefore, or even a\r\nbuffalo, lasts a party of voyageurs for a very short time, since they\r\nhave no other substance, such as bread or vegetables, to help it out.\r\nIt was necessary, then, that our travellers should use all their\r\ndiligence in laying up a stock of dried meat, before the winter became\r\ntoo cold for them to hunt.  There was another consideration--their\r\nclothing.  They all had clothing sufficient for such weather as they had\r\nyet experienced; but that would never do for the winter of the Great\r\nSlave Lake, and they knew it.  Many deer must be killed, and many hides\r\ndressed, before they could make a full set of clothing for all, as well\r\nas a set of deerskin blankets, which would be much needed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the snow-shoes were finished, therefore, Basil and Norman\r\nwent out each day upon long hunting expeditions, from which they rarely\r\nreturned before nightfall.  Sometimes they brought with them a deer, of\r\nthe caribou or reindeer species, and the \"woodland\" variety, which were\r\nplenty at this place.  They only carried to camp the best parts with the\r\nskin, as the flesh of the woodland caribou is not much esteemed.  It is\r\nlarger than the other kind--the \"Barren Ground caribou,\" weighing about\r\none hundred and fifty pounds; but both its venison and hide are of\r\ninferior quality to those of the latter species.  Sometimes our hunters\r\nkilled smaller game; and on several occasions they returned without\r\nhaving emptied their guns at all.  But there was one day that made up\r\nfor several--one grand day when they were extremely successful, and on\r\nwhich they killed a whole herd of moose, consisting of five\r\nindividuals--the old bull, a spike buck--that is, a young buck, whose\r\nhorns had not yet got antlers upon them--the cow, and two calves.  These\r\nthey had tracked and followed for a long distance, and had succeeded, at\r\nlength, in running into a valley where the snow was exceedingly deep,\r\nand where the moose became entangled.  There had been a shower of rain\r\nthe day before that had melted the surface of the snow; and this had\r\nagain frozen into an icy crust, upon which the deer lacerated their\r\nankles at every plunge, leaving a track of blood behind them as they\r\nran.  Under these circumstances they were easily trailed, and Basil and\r\nNorman, skimming along upon their snow-shoes, soon came up with them,\r\nand shot first one and then another, until the whole herd were stretched\r\nin the valley.  They then butchered them, and hung the hides and\r\nquarters upon high branches, so as to secure them from wolves and\r\nwolverenes.  When the job was finished, the whole place looked like a\r\ngreat slaughter-yard!  Next day a rude sledge was constructed; and the\r\nvoyageurs, returning in full force, transported the meat to camp.  Huge\r\nfires were kindled outside the hut, and several days were spent in\r\ncutting up and drying the flesh.  Had our travellers been certain that\r\nthe frost would have continued all winter, this would not have been\r\nnecessary--since the meat was already frozen as hard as a brick.  But\r\nthey knew that a sudden thaw would spoil it; and, as there was plenty of\r\ngood firewood on the spot, they were not going to run the risk of losing\r\nit in that way.\r\n\r\nThey had now enough provision to last them for months; and hunting\r\nbecame no longer necessary, except to obtain fresh meat--which was, of\r\ncourse, preferable to the dry stock.  Hunting, also, gave them exercise\r\nand amusement--both of which were necessary to their health; for to\r\nremain idle and inactive in a situation such as that in which they were\r\nplaced is the worst possible plan, and is sure to engender both sickness\r\nand _ennui_.  Indeed, the last grew upon them, notwithstanding all the\r\npains they took to prevent it.  There were days on which the cold was so\r\nextreme, that they could not put their noses out of the door without the\r\ndanger of having them frost-bitten--although each had now a complete\r\nsuit of deerskin clothing, made by Lucien, the \"tailor\" of the party.\r\nUpon such days they were fain to remain shut up in their hut; and,\r\nseated around their huge log-fire, they passed the time in cleaning\r\ntheir guns, mending their nets, stitching their clothes, and such-like\r\nemployments.  These days were far from being their dullest; for, what\r\nwith the varied and scientific knowledge of Lucien, which he took\r\npleasure in imparting to his companions--what with the practical\r\nexperience of Norman amid scenes of Arctic life, and the many \"voyageur\r\ntales\" he could tell--what with Francois' merry jokes and _bon mots_--\r\nand what with Basil's _talent for listening_--not the least important\r\nelement in a good _conversazione_,--our _quartette_ of young voyageurs\r\nfound their indoor days anything but dull.\r\n\r\nThis was all well enough for a while.  For a month or two they bore\r\ntheir odd kind of life cheerfully enough; but the prospect of nearly six\r\nmonths more of it began to appal them, when they reflected upon it; and\r\nthey soon found themselves longing for a change.  Hunting adventures,\r\nthat at other times would have interested them, now occurred without\r\ncreating any excitement; and the whole routine of their employments\r\nseemed monotonous.  Nearly all of them were boys of an active character\r\nof mind; and most of them were old enough to reason about the value of\r\ntime.  Their idea of such a long isolation from civilised life, and,\r\nabove all, the being debarred from following any useful pursuit, began\r\nto impress some of them forcibly.  Others, as Francois, could not be\r\ncontented for a very great stretch of time with any sort of life; so\r\nthat all of them began to sigh for a change.\r\n\r\nOne day, while conversing upon this theme, a bold proposal was made by\r\nBasil.  It was, that they should \"strike camp,\" and continue their\r\njourney.  This proposal took the others by surprise, but they were all\r\njust in the frame of mind to entertain and discuss it; and a long\r\nconsultation was held upon the point.  Francois chimed in with the\r\nproposal at once; while Lucien, more cautious, did not exactly oppose,\r\nbut rather offered the reasons that were against it, and pointed out the\r\nperils of the undertaking.  Norman, of course, was appealed to--all of\r\nthem looking to him as one whose advice, upon that question at least,\r\nwas more valuable than their own.\r\n\r\nNorman admitted the dangers pointed out by Lucien, but believed that\r\nthey might overcome them by a proper caution.  On the whole, Norman\r\napproved of the plan, and it was at length adopted.  Perhaps Norman's\r\nhabitual prudence was to some extent influenced on this occasion by the\r\nvery natural desire he had of returning to what he considered his home.\r\nHe had now been absent nearly two years, and was desirous of once more\r\nseeing his father and his old companions at the Fort.  There was another\r\nfeeling that influenced nearly all of them: that was _ambition_.  They\r\nknew that to make such a journey would be something of a feat, and they\r\nwished to have the credit of performing it.  To minds like that of\r\nBasil, even the danger had something attractive in it.  It was resolved\r\nthen to break up the encampment, and continue their journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY NINE.\r\n\r\nTRAVELLING ON SNOW-SHOES.\r\n\r\nOnce their resolution was taken, they lost but little time in making\r\npreparations to carry it out.  Most of the articles required for such a\r\njourney were already in their hands.  They had the proper dresses--\r\nsnow-shoes, skin-blankets, and gloves.  They had prepared for themselves\r\nsets of \"snow spectacles.\"  These were made out of red cedar-wood.  Each\r\npair consisted of two small thin pieces, that covered the eyes, joined\r\ntogether and fastened on by thongs of buckskin.  In each piece an oblong\r\nslit served for the eye-hole, through which the eye looked without being\r\ndazzled by the snow.  Without this, or some like contrivance, travelling\r\nin the Arctic regions is painful to the eyes, and the traveller often\r\nloses his sight.  Indeed, one of the most common infirmities of both the\r\nIndians and Esquimaux of these parts is blindness or soreness of the\r\neyes, caused by the reflexion of the sunbeams from the crystals of the\r\nfrozen snow.  Norman was aware of this, and had made the spectacles to\r\nguard against this peril.  Out of their spare skins they had made a\r\nsmall tent.  This was to be carried along by Marengo in a light sledge,\r\nwhich they had long since constructed, and taught the dog to draw.\r\nNothing else remained but to pack their provisions in the smallest bulk\r\npossible, and this was done, according to the custom of the country, by\r\nmaking \"pemmican.\"  The dry meat was first pounded until it became a\r\npowder; it was then put into small skin bags, made for the purpose, and\r\nthe hot melted fat was poured in and well mixed with it.  This soon\r\nfroze hard, and the mixture--that resembled \"potted meat,\"--was now\r\nready for use, and would keep for an indefinite time without the least\r\ndanger of spoiling.  Buffalo-beef, moose-meat, or venison of any sort,\r\nthus prepared, is called \"_pemmican_,\" and is more portable in this\r\nshape than any other.  Besides no further cooking is required--an\r\nimportant consideration upon those vast prairie deserts, where firewood\r\nis seldom to be procured without the trouble of carrying it a great\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nNorman, who was the maker of the pemmican, had produced a superior\r\narticle upon this occasion.  Besides the pounded meat and fat, he had\r\nmixed another ingredient with it, which rendered it a most delicious\r\nfood.  This third ingredient was a small purple-coloured berry--of which\r\nwe have already spoken--not unlike the whortleberry, but sweeter and of\r\na higher flavour.  It grows through most of the Northern regions of\r\nAmerica; and in some places, as upon the Red River and the Elk, the\r\nbushes that produce it are seen in great plenty.  When in flower, they\r\nappear almost white, so thickly are they covered with blossoms.  The\r\nleaves are small, and generally of an oval shape; but there are several\r\nvarieties of the bush, some of them having the dimensions and form of\r\ntrees, of twenty-five feet in height.  The berries have received\r\ndifferent names in different parts of America.  They are known as\r\n\"shadberries\", \"June-berries\", \"service-berries,\" and by the Canadian\r\nvoyageurs they are called \"le poire.\"  Even the botanists have given\r\nthem a great variety of names, as _pyrus, mespilus, aronia, crataegus_,\r\nand _amelanchier_.  No matter which may be the best name, it is enough\r\nto know that these little berries are delicious to eat when fresh, and\r\nwhen dried, after the manner of currants, are excellent to mix in\r\npuddings, as well as in pemmican.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the setting in of winter, our voyageurs had collected a\r\nlarge bagful upon the banks of the Elk, which they had dried and stored\r\naway--expecting to stand in need of them for this very purpose.  They\r\nnow came into use, and enabled Norman to make his pemmican of the very\r\nchoicest quality.  Five bags of it were put up, each weighing over\r\nthirty pounds.  One of these was to be drawn upon the sledge, along with\r\nthe tent, the axe, and a few other articles.  The rest were to be\r\ncarried by the voyageurs themselves--each shouldering one, which, along\r\nwith their guns and accoutrements, would be load enough.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements being at length complete, the party bid adieu to\r\ntheir log-hut--gave a parting look to their little canoe, which still\r\nrested by the door--and then, shouldering their guns and bags of\r\npemmican, set out over the frozen surface of the snow.\r\n\r\nOf course before starting they had decided upon the route they were to\r\ntake.  This decision, however, had not been arrived at until after much\r\ndiscussion.  Lucien advised that they should follow the shore of the\r\nlake until they should reach the Mackenzie River--which of course was\r\nnow frozen up.  Its channel, he argued, would then guide them; and, in\r\ncase their provisions should run short, they would be more likely to\r\nfind game upon its banks than elsewhere, as these were wooded almost to\r\nthe sea--in consequence of its head-waters rising in southern latitudes,\r\nand carrying with them a warmer climate.\r\n\r\nThere was plausibility in Lucien's argument, combined with much\r\nprudence.  Norman, however, advised a contrary course.  He said that\r\nthey would have to make a considerable journey westward before reaching\r\nthe place where the Mackenzie River flows out of the lake; and,\r\nmoreover, he knew that the river itself was very crooked--in some places\r\nwinding about in great curves, whose ends come near meeting each other.\r\nShould they keep the course of the river, Norman believed it would\r\nalmost double their journey.  A much shorter route, he said, would be\r\nobtained by striking across the country in a north-westerly direction,\r\nso as to reach the Mackenzie near where another great stream--the River\r\nof the Mountains--empties into it from the west.  This would certainly\r\nbe a more direct route, and they would avoid the windings of the river\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\nNorman's reasoning prevailed.  Basil and Francois readily agreed to his\r\nplan, and Lucien at length also gave his assent, but with some\r\nreluctance.  Norman knew nothing whatever of the route he was advising\r\nthem to take.  His former journeys up and down the Mackenzie had been\r\nmade in summer, and of course he had travelled by canoe, in company with\r\nthe traders and voyageurs.  He only knew that to strike across the\r\ncountry would be the shorter way.  But \"the shortest way is not always\r\nthe nearest,\" says the proverb; and although Lucien remembered this\r\nprudent maxim, the others did not give it a thought.  Before the end of\r\ntheir journey they received a practical lesson of its wisdom--a lesson\r\nthey were not likely to forget.  But they knew not what was before them,\r\nand they started off in high spirits.\r\n\r\nTheir first three or four days' journeys were without any event worth\r\nbeing chronicled.  They travelled full twenty miles each day.  The\r\nSoutherners had become quite skilful in the management of their\r\nsnow-shoes, and they skimmed along upon the icy crust at the rate of\r\nthree or four miles an hour.  Marengo and his sledge gave them very\r\nlittle trouble.  There was full sixty pounds weight upon it; but to the\r\nhuge dog this was a mere bagatelle, and he pulled it after him without\r\nany great strain.  His harness was neatly made of moose-skin, and\r\nconsisted of a collar with a back strap and traces--the traces meeting\r\nbehind, where they were attached to the head of the sledge.  No\r\nhead-gear was necessary, as Marengo needed not to be either led or\r\ndriven.  The sledge consisted of two or three light planks of smooth\r\nwood, laid alongside each other, and held together by transverse bands.\r\nIn front it turned up with a circular sweep, so as not to \"plough\" the\r\nsnow; and at the top of this curved part the traces were adjusted.  The\r\nload was, of course, carefully packed and tied, so that the overturning\r\nof the vehicle did no damage whatever, and it could be easily righted\r\nagain.  Marengo required no one to guide him, but followed quietly in\r\nthe tracks of the snow-shoes, and thus avoided the trees, rocks, and\r\nother inequalities.  If a rabbit or other creature started up, Marengo\r\nknew better than to go galloping after it; he felt that he had a more\r\nimportant duty to perform than to throw away his time upon\r\nrabbit-hunting.  Each night a spot was chosen for the camp by the side\r\nof some lake or stream, where wood could be obtained for their fire.\r\nWater was got by breaking a hole in the ice, and the little tent was\r\nalways set up in a sheltered situation.\r\n\r\nUpon the fifth day after leaving the log-hut the woods began to grow\r\nthinner and more straggling; and towards night of the same day they\r\nfound themselves travelling through a country, where the timber only\r\ngrew here and there in small clumps, and the individual trees were small\r\nand stunted.  Next day still less timber was seen upon their route; and\r\nwhen camping-time came, they were obliged to halt at a spot where\r\nnothing but willows could be procured for their fire.  They had, in\r\nfact, arrived upon the edge of that vast wilderness, the Barren Grounds,\r\nwhich stretches in all its wild desolation along the Northern half of\r\nthe American continent, (from the Great Slave Lake even to the shores of\r\nthe Arctic Sea on the north, and to those of Hudson's Bay on the east).\r\nThis territory bears an appropriate name, for, perhaps, upon the whole\r\nsurface of the earth there is no tract more barren or desolate--not even\r\nthe Sahara of Africa.  Both are deserts of immense extent, equally\r\ndifficult to cross, and equally dangerous to the traveller.  On both the\r\ntraveller often perishes, but from different causes.  On the Sahara it\r\nis _thirst_ that kills; upon the Barren Grounds _hunger_ is more\r\nfrequently the destroyer.  In the latter there is but little to be\r\nfeared on the score of water.  That exists in great plenty; or where it\r\nis not found, snow supplies its place.  But there is water everywhere.\r\nHill succeeds hill, bleak, rocky, and bare.  Everywhere granite, gneiss,\r\nor other primitive rocks, show themselves.  No vegetation covers the\r\nsteep declivities of the hills, except the moss and lichen upon the\r\nrocks, a few willows upon the banks of streams, the dwarf birch-tree\r\n(_Betula nana_), or the scrub-pines, rising only to the height of a few\r\ninches, and often straggling over the earth like vines.  Every hill has\r\nits valley, and every valley its lake--dark, and deep, and silent--in\r\nwinter scarce to be distinguished under the snow-covered ice.  The\r\nprospect in every direction exhibits a surface of rocks, or bleak hills,\r\nhalf covered with snow.  The traveller looks around and sees no life.\r\nHe listens and hears no sound.  The world appears dead and wrapped in\r\nits cold winding-sheet!\r\n\r\nAmidst just such scenes did our voyageurs find themselves on the seventh\r\nday after parting from the lake.  They had heard of the Barren\r\nGrounds,--had heard many fearful stories of the sufferings of travellers\r\nwho had attempted to cross them; but the description had fallen far\r\nshort of the actual reality.  None of them could believe in the\r\ndifficulties to be encountered, and the desolateness of the scene they\r\nwere to witness, until now that they found themselves in its midst; and,\r\nas they proceeded on their journey, getting farther and farther from the\r\nwooded region, their apprehensions, already aroused by the wild aspect\r\nof the country, grew stronger and stronger.  They began to entertain\r\nserious fears, for they knew not how far the barren tract extended along\r\ntheir route.  On calculation they found they had provisions enough to\r\nlast them for a month.  That in some measure restored their confidence;\r\nbut even then, they could not help giving way to serious reflections.\r\nShould they get lost or retarded in their course by mountains, or other\r\nobstacles, it might take them longer than a month to reach some place\r\nwhere game was to be met with.  Each day, as they advanced, they found\r\nthe country more hilly and difficult.  Precipices often bounded the\r\nvalleys, lying directly across their track; and as these could not be\r\nscaled, it was necessary to make long _detours_ to pass them, so that\r\nsome days they actually advanced less than five miles upon their\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these impediments, they might still have got over the\r\nBarren Grounds without further suffering than the fatigue and necessary\r\nexposure to cold; but at this time an incident occurred, that not only\r\nfrustrated all their calculations, but placed them in imminent danger of\r\nperishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY.\r\n\r\nTHE BARREN GROUNDS.\r\n\r\nThe Barren Grounds are not entirely destitute of animal life.  Even in\r\nwinter--when they are almost covered with snow, and you would suppose\r\nthat no living creature could procure subsistence upon them--even then\r\nthey have their denizens; and, strange to say, there are many animals\r\nthat choose them for their home.  There is no part of the earth's\r\nsurface so sterile but that some animated being can find a living upon\r\nit, and such a being Nature adapts to its peculiar situation.  For\r\ninstance, there are animals that prefer the very desert itself, and\r\nwould not thrive were you to place them in a country of mild climate and\r\nfertile soil.  In our own species this peculiarity is also found--as the\r\nEsquimaux would not be happy were you to transplant him from his icy hut\r\namidst the snows of the Arctic regions, and give him a palace under the\r\ngenial skies of Italy.\r\n\r\nAmong other creatures that remain all winter upon the Barren Grounds,\r\nare the wolves.  How they exist there is almost a question of the\r\nnaturalists.  It is true they prey upon other animals found at times in\r\nthe same district; but wolves have been met with where not the slightest\r\ntraces of other living creatures could be seen!\r\n\r\nThere is no animal more generally distributed over the earth's surface\r\nthan the wolf.  He exists in nearly every country, and most likely has\r\nat one time existed in all.  In America there are wolves in its three\r\nzones.  They are met with from Cape Horn to the farthest point northward\r\nthat man has reached.  They are common in the tropical forests of Mexico\r\nand South America.  They range over the great prairies of the temperate\r\nzones of both divisions of the continent, and in the colder regions of\r\nthe Hudson's Bay territory they are among the best known of wild\r\nanimals.  They frequent the mountains, they gallop over the plains, they\r\nskulk through the valleys, they dwell everywhere--everywhere the wolf\r\nseems equally at home.  In North America two very different kinds are\r\nknown.  One is the \"prairie\" or \"barking\" wolf, which we have already\r\nmet with and described.  The other species is the \"common\" or \"large\"\r\nwolf; but it is not decided among naturalists that there are not several\r\ndistinct species of the latter.  At all events, there are several\r\nvarieties of it--distinguished from each other in size, colour, and even\r\nto some extent in form.  The habits of all, however, appear to be\r\nsimilar, and it is a question, whether any of these varieties be\r\n_permanent_ or only _accidental_.  Some of them, it is well-known, are\r\naccidental--as wolves differing in colour have been found in the same\r\nlitter--but late explorers, of the countries around and beyond the Rocky\r\nMountains, have discovered one or two kinds that appear to be\r\nspecifically distinct from the common wolf of America--one of them, the\r\n\"dusky wolf,\" being much larger.\r\n\r\nThis last is said to resemble the wolf of Europe (the Pyrenean wolf,\r\n_Canis lupus_) more than the other American wolves do--for there is a\r\nconsiderable difference between the wolves of the two continents.  Those\r\nof the Northern regions of America have shorter ears, a broader snout\r\nand forehead, and are of a stouter make, than the European wolves.\r\nTheir fur, too, is finer, denser, and longer; their tails more bushy and\r\nfox-like; and their feet broader.  The European wolf, on the contrary,\r\nis characterised by a gaunt appearance, a pointed snout, long jaws, high\r\nears, long legs, and feet very narrow.  It is possible, notwithstanding\r\nthese points of difference, that both may be of the same species, the\r\ndifference arising from a want of similitude in the circumstances by\r\nwhich they are surrounded.  For instance, the dense wool of the Hudson's\r\nBay wolf may be accounted for by the fact of its colder habitat, and its\r\nbroader feet may be the result of its having to run much upon the\r\nsurface of the snow.  The writer of this little book believes that this\r\npeculiar adaptation of Nature--which may be observed in all her\r\nkingdoms--may explain the difference that exists between the wolves of\r\nthe Northern parts of America and those of the South of Europe.  He\r\nbelieves, moreover, that those of the Southern parts of the American\r\ncontinent approximate more nearly to the Pyrenean wolves, as he has seen\r\nin the tropical forests of Mexico some that possessed all that \"gaunt\"\r\nform and \"sneaking\" aspect that characterise the latter.  It would be\r\ninteresting to inquire whether the wolves of Siberia and Lapland,\r\ninhabiting a similar climate to that of the Northern parts of America,\r\ndo not possess the same peculiarities as the North American kind--a\r\npoint which naturalists have not yet considered, and which you, my boy\r\nreader, may some day find both amusement and instruction in determining\r\nfor yourself.\r\n\r\nWith regard to colour the wolves of both continents exhibit many\r\nvarieties.  In North America there are more than half-a-dozen colours of\r\nthem, all receiving different names.  There is the \"grey wolf,\" the\r\n\"white,\" the \"brown,\" the \"dusky,\" the \"pied,\" and the \"black.\"  These\r\ntrivial names will give a good enough idea of the colours of each kind,\r\nbut there are even varieties in their markings.  \"Yellow\" wolves, too,\r\nhave been seen, and \"red\" ones, and some of a \"cream colour.\"  Of all\r\nthese the grey wolf is the most common, and is _par excellence the\r\nwolf_; but there are districts in which individuals of other colours\r\npredominate.  Wolves purely black are plenty in many parts, and white\r\nwolves are often seen in large packs.\r\n\r\nEven those of the same colour differ in size, and that to a considerable\r\nextent.  And, what is also strange, large wolves will be found in one\r\ndistrict of country, while much smaller ones _of the same colour and\r\nspecies_ inhabit another.  The largest in size of American wolves are\r\nabout six feet in length, the tail included; and about three feet in\r\nheight, measuring to the tips of the standing fur.  The tail is usually\r\nabout one-third of the whole length.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the American wolf are pretty much like those of his\r\nEuropean cousin.  He is a beast of prey, devouring all the smaller\r\nanimals he can lay hold of.  He pursues and overtakes the deer, and\r\noften runs down the fox and makes a meal of it.  He will kill and eat\r\nIndian dogs, although these are so near his own species that the one is\r\noften taken for the other.  But this is not all, for he will even eat\r\nhis own kind, on a pinch.  He is as cunning as the fox himself, and as\r\ncowardly; but at times, when impelled by hunger, he becomes bolder, and\r\nhas been known to attack man.  Instances of this kind, however, are\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nThe American wolves burrow, and, like the fox, have several entrances to\r\ntheir holes.  A litter of young wolves numbers five puppies, but as many\r\nas eight are often produced at one birth.\r\n\r\nDuring their journey through the Barren Grounds our voyageurs had\r\nfrequently observed wolves.  They were mostly grey ones, and of great\r\nsize, for they were travelling through a district where the very largest\r\nkind is found.  At times they saw a party of five or six together; and\r\nthese appeared to be following upon their trail--as each night, when\r\nthey came barking about the camp, our travellers recognised some of them\r\nas having been seen before.  They had made no attempt to shoot any of\r\nthem--partly because they did not want either their skins or flesh, and\r\npartly because their ammunition had been reduced to a small quantity,\r\nand they did not wish to spend it unnecessarily.  The wolves, therefore,\r\nwere allowed to approach very near the camp, and howl as much as they\r\nliked--which they usually did throughout the livelong night.  What they\r\nfound to allure them after our travellers, the latter could not make\r\nout; as they had not shot an animal of any kind since leaving the lake,\r\nand scarcely a scrap of anything was ever left behind them.  Perhaps the\r\nwolves were _living upon hope_.\r\n\r\nOne evening our travellers had made their camp on the side of a ridge--\r\nwhich they had just crossed--and under the shelter of some rough rocks.\r\nThere was no wood in the neighbourhood wherewith to make a fire; but\r\nthey had scraped the snow from the place over which their tent was\r\npitched, and under it their skins were spread upon the ground.  As the\r\ntent was a very small one, Marengo's sledge, with the utensils and\r\npemmican bags, was always left outside close by the opening.  Marengo\r\nhimself slept there, and that was considered sufficient to secure all\r\nthese things from wolves, or any other creatures that might be prowling\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nOn the evening in question, the sledge was in its usual place--the dog\r\nhaving been taken from it--and as our voyageurs had not yet had their\r\nsupper, the pemmican bags were lying loosely about, one or two of them\r\nbeing open.  There was a small rivulet at the foot of the ridge--some\r\ntwo hundred paces distant--and Basil and Francois had gone down to it to\r\nget water.  One of them took the axe to break the ice with, while the\r\nother carried a vessel.  On arriving near the bank of the rivulet, the\r\nattention of the boys was attracted to a singular appearance upon the\r\nsnow.  A fresh shower had fallen that morning, and the surface was still\r\nsoft, and very smooth.  Upon this they observed double lines of little\r\ndots, running in different directions, which, upon close inspection,\r\nappeared to be the tracks of some animal.  At first, Basil and Francois\r\ncould hardly believe them to be such, the tracks were so very small.\r\nThey had never seen so small ones before--those of a mouse being quite\r\ndouble the size.  But when they looked more closely at them, the boys\r\ncould distinguish the marks of five little toes with claws upon them,\r\nwhich left no doubt upon their minds that some living creature, and that\r\na very diminutive one, must have passed over the spot.  Indeed, had the\r\nsnow not been both fine-grained and soft, the feet of such a creature\r\ncould not have made any impression upon it.\r\n\r\nThe boys stopped and looked around, thinking they might see the animal\r\nitself.  There was a wide circle of snow around them, and its surface\r\nwas smooth and level; but not a speck upon it betrayed the presence of\r\nany creature.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it was a bird,\" said Francois, \"and has taken flight.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" rejoined Basil.  \"They are not the tracks of a bird.  It\r\nis some animal that has gone under the snow, I fancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I see no hole,\" said Francois, \"where even a beetle could have gone\r\ndown.  Let us look for one.\"\r\n\r\nAt Francois' suggestion, they walked on following one of the dotted\r\nlines.  Presently they came to a place, where a stalk of long grass\r\nstood up through the snow--its seedless panicle just appearing above the\r\nsurface.  Round this stalk a little hole had been formed--partly by the\r\nmelting of the snow, and partly by the action of the wind upon the\r\npanicle--and into this hole the tracks led.  It was evident that the\r\nanimal, whatever it was, must have gone down the culm of the grass in\r\nmaking its descent from the surface of the snow!  They now observed\r\nanother track going from the hole in an opposite direction, which showed\r\nthat the creature had climbed up in the same way.  Curious to know what\r\nit might have been, the boys hailed Lucien and Norman, telling them to\r\ncome down.  These, followed by Marengo, soon arrived upon the spot.\r\nWhen Lucien saw the tracks, he pronounced them at once to be those of\r\nthe little shrew-mouse (_Sorex parvus_), the smallest of all the\r\nquadrupeds of America.  Several of them had evidently been out upon the\r\nsnow--as there were other dotted lines--and the tops of many stalks of\r\ngrass were seen above the surface, each of which had formed a little\r\nhole around it, by which the mice were enabled to get up and down.\r\n\r\nNorman, who had seen these little animals before, cautioned his\r\ncompanions to remain quiet awhile, and perhaps some of them might come\r\nto the surface.  They all stopped therefore, and stood some time without\r\nmoving, or speaking to one another.  Presently, a little head not much\r\nbigger than a pea was seen peeping up, and then a body followed, which\r\nin size did not exceed that of a large gooseberry!  To this a tail was\r\nsuspended, just one inch in length, of a square shape, and tapering from\r\nroot to point, like that of any other mouse.  The little creature was\r\ncovered with a close smooth fur, of a clove-brown colour above, but more\r\nyellowish upon the belly and sides; and was certainly, as it sat upon\r\nthe even surface of the snow, the most diminutive and oddest-looking\r\nquadruped that any of the party had ever beheld.\r\n\r\nThey were just whispering to one another what means they should use to\r\ncapture it, when Marengo, whom Basil had been holding quiet, all at once\r\nuttered a loud bay; and, springing out of the hands of his master,\r\ngalloped off towards the camp.  All of them looked after, wondering what\r\nhad started the dog; but his strange behaviour was at once explained,\r\nand to their consternation.  Around the tent, and close to its entrance,\r\nseveral large wolves were seen.  They were leaping about hurriedly, and\r\nworrying some objects that lay upon the ground.  What these objects were\r\nwas too plain.  They were _the bags of pemmican_!  Part of their\r\ncontents was seen strewed over the snow, and part was already in the\r\nstomachs of the wolves.\r\n\r\nThe boys uttered a simultaneous shout, and ran forward.  Marengo was by\r\nthis time among the wolves, and had set fiercely upon one of them.  Had\r\nhis masters not been at hand, the fierce brutes would soon have settled\r\nthe account with Marengo.  But the former were now close by, and the\r\nwolves, seeing them, ran off; but, to the consternation of the boys,\r\neach of them carried off a bag of the pemmican in his mouth with as much\r\nlightness and speed as if nothing encumbered them!\r\n\r\n\"We are lost!\" cried Norman, in a voice of terror.  \"Our provisions are\r\ngone!--all gone!\"\r\n\r\nIt was true.  The next moment the wolves disappeared over the summit of\r\nthe ridge; and although each of the boys had seized his gun, and ran\r\nafter, the pursuit proved an idle one.  Not a wolf was overtaken.\r\n\r\nScarce a scrap of the pemmican had been left--only some fragments that\r\nhad been gnawed by the ravenous brutes, and scattered over the snow.\r\nThat night our travellers went to bed supperless; and, what with hunger,\r\nand the depression of spirits caused by this incident, one and all of\r\nthem kept awake nearly the whole of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE ROCK-TRIPE.\r\n\r\nThey left their skin-couch at an early hour, close after daybreak.\r\nHunger and anxiety drove them out of their tent.  Not a morsel of\r\nanything for breakfast!  They looked abroad over the country, in order,\r\nif possible, to descry some living creature.  None could be seen--\r\nnothing but the wilderness waste of snow, with here and there the side\r\nof a steep hill, or a rock showing cold and bleak.  Even the wolves that\r\nhad robbed them were no longer to be seen, as if these creatures knew\r\nthat they had got all that was worth having, and had now taken\r\nthemselves off to hunt for plunder elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe situation of our travellers was really one of extreme peril,\r\nalthough it may be difficult for you, young reader, to conceive why it\r\nshould be so.  They, however, knew it well.  They knew that they might\r\ntravel for days through that inhospitable region, without falling in\r\nwith anything that would make a single meal for them.  But less time\r\nthan that would suffice to starve them all.  Already they felt the pangs\r\nof hunger--for they had not eaten since their breakfast of the preceding\r\nday, the wolves having interrupted their preparations for dinner.\r\n\r\nIt was of no use remaining where they were; so, striking their tent once\r\nmore, they travelled forward.  It was but poor consolation to them that\r\nthey travelled much lighter than before.  They had nothing to carry but\r\ntheir guns, and these they had got ready for work--so that their journey\r\npartook somewhat of the character of a hunting excursion.  They did not\r\neven follow a direct course, but occasionally turned to one side or the\r\nother, wherever a clump of willows, or any other roughness on the\r\nground, looked like it might be the shelter of game.  But during that\r\nwhole day--although they travelled from near sunrise to sunset--not a\r\nliving thing was seen; and for the second night they went supperless to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nA man will bear hunger for many days--some more, some less--without\r\nactually dying of it; but at no period will his sufferings be greater\r\nthan during the third or fourth day.  He will grow more feeble\r\nafterwards, but the pain which he endures will not be greater.\r\n\r\nOn the third day the sufferings of our party were extreme.  They began\r\nto chew pieces of their skin-tent and blankets; but although this took\r\nthe sharp edge off their appetites, it added nothing to their strength;\r\nand they still craved for food, and grew feebler.\r\n\r\nTo use a poetical phrase, Marengo now became the \"cynosure of every\r\neye.\"  Marengo was not very fat.  The sledge and short rations had\r\nthinned him down, and his ribs could be easily traced.  Although the\r\nboys, and Basil in particular, would have suffered much before\r\nsacrificing him, yet starvation will reconcile a man to part with his\r\nbest friend.  In spite of their friendship for Marengo, his masters\r\ncould not help scanning him from time to time with hungry looks.\r\nMarengo was an old dog, and, no doubt, as tough as a piece of\r\ntan-leather; but their appetites were made up for anything.\r\n\r\nIt was near midday.  They had started early, as on the day before.  They\r\nwere trudging wearily along, and making but little progress.  Marengo\r\nwas struggling with his sledge, feeble as any of the party.  Basil saw\r\nthat the eyes of his companions were from time to time bent upon the\r\ndog; and though none of them said anything, he understood the thoughts\r\nthat were passing within them.  He knew that none of them wished to\r\npropose it--as Basil was the real master of Marengo--but their glances\r\nwere sufficiently intelligible to him.  He looked at the downcast\r\ncountenance of the once merry Francois,--at the serious air of Norman--\r\nat the wan cheek and sunken eye of Lucien, whom Basil dearly loved.  He\r\nhesitated no longer.  His duty to his companions at once overcame his\r\naffection for his faithful dog.\r\n\r\n\"We must kill him!\" said he, suddenly stopping, and pointing to Marengo.\r\n\r\nThe rest halted.\r\n\r\n\"I fear there's no help for it,\" said Norman, turning his face in every\r\ndirection, and sweeping the surface of the snow with hopeless glances.\r\n\r\nFrancois also assented to the proposal.\r\n\r\n\"Let us make a condition,\" suggested Lucien; \"I for one could walk five\r\nmiles farther.\"  And as Lucien said this, he made an effort to stand\r\nerect, and look strong and brave; but Basil knew it was an effort of\r\n_generosity_.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said he,--\"no, dear Luce.  You are done up.  We must kill the\r\ndog!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, Basil, you mistake,\" replied the other; \"I assure you I am\r\nfar from being done up.  I could go much farther yet.  Stay!\" continued\r\nhe, pointing ahead; \"you see yonder rocks?  They are about three miles\r\noff, I should think.  They lie directly in our course.  Well, now, let\r\nus agree to this condition.  Let us give poor Marengo a chance for his\r\nlife.  If we find nothing before reaching those rocks, why then--\"\r\n\r\nAnd Lucien, seeing Marengo gazing up in his face, left the sentence\r\nunfinished.  The poor brute looked up at all of them as though he\r\nunderstood every word that they were saying; and his mute appeal, had it\r\nbeen necessary, would not have been thrown away.  But it did not require\r\nthat to get him the proposed respite.  All agreed willingly with\r\nLucien's proposition; and, shouldering their pieces, the party moved on.\r\n\r\nLucien had purposely understated the distance to the rocks.  It was\r\nfive, instead of three miles; and some of them made it full ten, as they\r\nwere determined Marengo should have the benefit of every chance.  They\r\ndeployed like skirmishers; and not a brake or brush that lay to the\r\nright or left of the path but was visited and beaten by one or other of\r\nthem.  Their diligence was to no purpose.  After two hours' weary work,\r\nthey arrived among the rocks, having seen not a trace of either\r\nquadruped or bird.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" cried Lucien in his now feeble voice, still trying to look\r\ncheerful, \"we must pass through them.  There is a chance yet.  Let him\r\nhave fair play.  The rocks were to be the limit, but it was not stated\r\nwhat part of them.  Let us pass through to the other side--they do not\r\nextend far.\"\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the words of Lucien, the party entered among the rocks,\r\nmoving on separate paths.  They had gone only a few paces, when a shout\r\nfrom Norman caused the rest to look to him for an explanation.  No\r\nanimal was in sight.  Had he seen any?  No; but something that gratified\r\nhim certainly, for his voice and manner expressed it.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" inquired the others, all speaking at the same time.\r\n\r\n\"_Tripe de roche_!\" answered he.\r\n\r\n\"_Tripe de roche_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Norman, \"look there!\" and he pointed to one of the rocks\r\ndirectly ahead of them, at the same time moving forward to it.  The\r\nothers hastened up after.  On reaching the rock, they saw what Norman\r\nhad meant by the words _tripe de roche_ (rock-tripe).  It was a black,\r\nhard, crumply substance, that nearly covered the surface of the rock,\r\nand was evidently of a vegetable nature.  Lucien knew what it was as\r\nwell as Norman, and joy had expressed itself upon his pale cheeks at the\r\nsight.  As for Basil and Francois they only stood waiting an\r\nexplanation, and wondering what value a quantity of \"rock moss,\" as they\r\ndeemed it, could be to persons in their condition.  Lucien soon informed\r\nthem that it was not a \"moss,\" but a \"lichen,\" and of that celebrated\r\nspecies which will sustain human life.  It was the _Gyrophora_.  Norman\r\nconfirmed Lucien's statement, and furthermore affirmed, that not only\r\nthe Indians and Esquimaux, but also parties of voyageurs, had often\r\nsubsisted upon it for days, when they would otherwise have starved.\r\nThere are many species,--not less than five or six.  All of them possess\r\nnutritive properties, but only one is a palatable food--the _Gyrophora\r\nvellea_ of botanists.  Unfortunately, this was not the sort which our\r\nvoyageurs had happened upon, as it grows only upon rocks shaded by\r\nwoods, and is rarely met with in the open barrens.  The one, however,\r\nwhich Norman had discovered was the \"next best,\" and they were all glad\r\nat finding even that.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be thought of was to collect it, and all four set to\r\npeeling and scraping it from the rocks.  The next thought was to make it\r\nready for eating.  Here a new difficulty stared them in the face.  The\r\n_tripe de roche_ had to be boiled,--it could not be eaten else,--and\r\nwhere was the fire? where was the wood to make one?  Not a stick was to\r\nbe seen.  They had not met with a tree during all that day's journey!\r\n\r\nThey were now as badly off as ever.  The _tripe de roche_ would be of no\r\nmore use to them than so much dry grass.  What could they do with it?\r\n\r\nIn the midst of their suspense, one of them thought of the sledge--\r\nMarengo's sledge.  That would make a fire, but a very small one.  It\r\nmight do to cook a single meal.  Even that was better than none.\r\nMarengo was not going to object to the arrangement.  He looked quite\r\nwilling to part with the sledge.  But a few hours before, it came near\r\nbeing used to cook Marengo himself.  He was not aware of that, perhaps,\r\nbut no matter.  All agreed that the sledge must be broken up, and\r\nconverted into firewood.\r\n\r\nThey were about taking it to pieces, and had already \"unhitched\" Marengo\r\nfrom it, when Basil, who had walked to the other side of the rocky\r\njumble, cried back to them to desist.  He had espied some willows at no\r\ngreat distance.  Out of these a fire could be made.  The sledge,\r\ntherefore, was let alone for the present.  Basil and Francois\r\nimmediately started for the willows, while Norman and Lucien remained\r\nupon the spot to prepare the \"tripe\" for the pot.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the former parties returned with two large bundles of\r\nwillows, and the fire was kindled.  The _tripe de roche_, with some\r\nsnow--for there was no water near--was put into the pot, and the latter\r\nhung over the blaze.\r\n\r\nAfter boiling for nearly an hour, the lichen became reduced to a soft\r\ngummy pulp, and Norman thickened the mess to his taste by putting in\r\nmore snow, or more of the \"tripe,\" as it seemed to require it.  The pot\r\nwas then taken from the fire, and all four greedily ate of its contents.\r\nIt was far from being palatable, and had a clammy \"feel\" in the mouth,\r\nsomething like sago; but none of the party was in any way either dainty\r\nor fastidious just at that time, and they soon consumed all that had\r\nbeen cooked.  It did not satisfy the appetite, though it filled the\r\nstomach, and made their situation less painful to bear.\r\n\r\nNorman informed them that it was much better when cooked with a little\r\nmeat, so as to make broth.  This Norman's companions could easily\r\ncredit, but where was the meat to come from?  The Indians prefer the\r\n_tripe de roche_ when prepared along with the roe of fish, or when\r\nboiled in fish liquor.\r\n\r\nOur weary voyageurs resolved to remain among the rocks for that night at\r\nleast; and with this intent they put up their little tent.  They did not\r\nkindle any fire, as the willows were scarce, and there would be barely\r\nenough to make one or two more boilings of the rock-tripe.  They spread\r\ntheir skins within the tent, and creeping in, kept one another as warm\r\nas they could until morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY TWO.\r\n\r\nTHE POLAR HARE AND GREAT SNOWY OWL.\r\n\r\nOf course hunger kept them from sleeping late.  They were up and out of\r\nthe tent by an early hour.  Their fire was re-kindled, and they were\r\nmaking preparations for a fresh pot of rock-tripe, when they were\r\nstartled by the note of a well-known bird.  On looking up, they beheld\r\nseated upon the point of a rock the creature itself, which was the\r\n\"cinereous crow\" (_Garrulus Canadensis_), or, as it is better known, the\r\n\"whiskey Jack.\"  The latter name it receives from the voyageurs,\r\non account of the resemblance of its Indian appellation,\r\n\"whiskae-shaw-neesh,\" to the words \"whiskey John.\"  Although sometimes\r\ncalled the \"cinereous crow,\" the bird is a true jay.  It is one of the\r\nmost inelegant of the genus, being of a dull grey colour, and not\r\nparticularly graceful in its form.  Its plumage, moreover, does not\r\nconsist of webbed feathers, but rather more resembles hair; nor does its\r\nvoice make up for the plainness of its appearance, as is the case with\r\nsome birds.  On the contrary, the voice of \"whiskey Jack\" is plaintive\r\nand squeaking, though he is something of a mocker in his way, and\r\nfrequently imitates the notes of other birds.  He is one of those\r\ncreatures that frequent the habitations of man, and there is not a fur\r\npost, or fort, in all the Hudson's Bay territory, where \"whiskey Jack\"\r\nis not familiarly known.  He is far from being a favourite, however, as,\r\nlike his near relative the magpie, he is a great thief, and will follow\r\nthe marten-trapper all day while baiting his traps, perching upon a tree\r\nuntil the bait is set, and then pouncing down, and carrying it off.  He\r\nfrequently pilfers small articles from the forts and encampments, and is\r\nso bold as to enter the tents, and seize food out of any vessel that may\r\ncontain it.  Notwithstanding all this, he is a favourite with the\r\ntraveller through these inhospitable regions.  No matter how barren the\r\nspot where the voyageur may make his camp, his tent will hardly be\r\npitched, before he receives a visit from \"whiskey Jack,\" who comes, of\r\ncourse, to pick up any crumbs that may fall.  His company, therefore, in\r\na region where all other wild creatures shun the society of man, endears\r\nhim to the lonely traveller.\r\n\r\nAt many of their camps our voyageurs had met with this singular bird,\r\nand were always glad to receive him as a friend.  They were now doubly\r\ndelighted to see him, but this delight arose from no friendly feelings.\r\nTheir guest was at once doomed to die.  Francois had taken up his gun,\r\nand in the next moment would have brought him down, had he not been\r\nchecked by Norman.  Not that Norman intended to plead for his life, but\r\nNorman's eye had caught sight of another \"whiskey Jack,\"--which was\r\nhopping among the rocks at some distance--and fearing that Francois'\r\nshot might frighten it away, had hindered him from firing.  It was\r\nNorman's design to get both.\r\n\r\nThe second \"whiskey Jack,\" or, perhaps, it was the whiskey \"Jill,\" soon\r\ndrew near; and both were now seen to hop from rock to rock, and then\r\nupon the top of the tent, and _one of them actually settled_ upon the\r\nedge of the pot, as it hung over the fire, and quietly looking into it,\r\nappeared to scrutinise its contents!\r\n\r\nThe boys could not think of any way of getting the birds, except by\r\nFrancois' gun; and it was at length agreed that Francois should do his\r\nbest.  He was sure of one of them, at least; so telling the others to\r\nget behind him, he fired at the more distant one where it sat upon the\r\ntent, and took the other on the wing.\r\n\r\nBoth shots were successful.  The two jays fell, and were soon divested\r\nof their soft, silky, hair-like plumage, and dropped into the boiling\r\npot.  They did not weigh together more than about six or seven ounces;\r\nbut even that was accounted something under present circumstances; and,\r\nwith the _tripe de roche_, a much better breakfast was made than they\r\nhad anticipated.\r\n\r\nNo more of the lichen could be found.  The rocks were all searched, but\r\nonly a few patches--not enough for another full meal--could be obtained.\r\nThe travellers had no other resource, therefore, but to continue on,\r\nand passing through the rocky ground, they once more embarked upon the\r\nwilderness of snow.\r\n\r\nDuring that whole day not a living creature gladdened their eyes.  They\r\nsaw nothing that was eatable--fish, flesh, fowl, or vegetable.  Not even\r\na bit of rock-tripe--in these parts the last resource of starving men--\r\ncould be met with.  They encamped in a plain, where not a tree stood--\r\nnot even a rock to shelter them.\r\n\r\nNext morning a consultation was held.  Marengo was again the subject of\r\ntheir thoughts and conversation.  Should they kill him on the spot or go\r\na little farther?  That was the question.  Lucien, as before, interposed\r\nin his favour.  There was a high hill many miles off, and in their\r\nproper course.  \"Let us first reach yonder hill,\" proposed Lucien.  \"If\r\nnothing is found before that, then we must part with Marengo.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposal was agreed to, and, striking their tent, they again set\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIt was a toilsome long way to that hill--feeble and weary as they all\r\nwere--but they reached it without having observed the slightest trace of\r\nanimal life.\r\n\r\n\"Up the hill!\" cried Lucien, beckoning to the others, and cheering them\r\nwith his weak voice, \"Up the hill!\"\r\n\r\nOn they went, up the steep declivity--Marengo toiling on after them.\r\nThe dog looked downcast and despairing.  He really appeared to know the\r\nconditions that had been made for his life.  His masters, as they crept\r\nupward, looked sharply before them.  Every tuft that appeared above the\r\nsnow was scrutinised, and every inch of the ground, as it came into\r\nview, was examined.\r\n\r\nAt length they crossed the escarpment of the hill, and stood upon the\r\nsummit.  They gazed forward with disappointed feelings.  The hill-top\r\nwas a sort of table plain, of about three hundred yards in diameter.  It\r\nwas covered with snow, nearly a foot in depth.  A few heads of withered\r\ngrass were seen above the surface, but not enough to subdue the uniform\r\nwhite that prevailed all over.  There was no creature upon it; that was\r\nevident.  A bird as big as a sparrow, or a quadruped as large as a\r\nshrew-mouse, could have been seen upon any part of it.  A single glance\r\nsatisfied all of them that no living thing was there.\r\n\r\nThey halted without proceeding farther.  Some of them could not have\r\ngone another mile, and all of them were tottering in their tracks.\r\nMarengo had arrived upon the summit, and stood a little to one side,\r\nwith the sledge behind him.\r\n\r\n\"_You_ must do it!\" said Basil, speaking to Norman in a hoarse voice,\r\nand turning his head away.  Lucien and Francois stepped aside at the\r\nsame time, and stood as if looking down the hill.  The countenances of\r\nall three betokened extreme sorrow.  There was a tear in Basil's eye\r\nthat he was trying to wipe away with his sleeve.\r\n\r\nThe sharp click of Norman's gun was heard behind them, and they were all\r\nwaiting for the report, when, at that moment, a dark shadow passing over\r\nthe white declivity arrested their attention!  It was the shadow of a\r\nbird upon the wing.  The simultaneous exclamation of all three stayed\r\nNorman's finger--already pressing upon the trigger--and the latter,\r\nturning round, saw that they were regarding some object in the air.  It\r\nwas a bird of great size--almost as large as an eagle, but with the\r\nplumage of a swan.  It was white all over--both body and wings--white as\r\nthe snow over which it was sailing.  Norman knew the bird at a glance.\r\nIts thick short neck and large head--its broad-spreading wings, of milky\r\nwhiteness, were not to be mistaken.  It was the \"great snowy owl\" of the\r\nArctic regions.\r\n\r\nIts appearance suddenly changed the aspect of affairs.  Norman let the\r\nbutt of his rifle fall to the ground, and stood, like the rest, watching\r\nthe bird in its flight.\r\n\r\nThe snowy owl (_Strix nyctea_) is, perhaps, the most beautiful, as it is\r\none of the most powerful birds of its genus--of which there are more\r\nthan a dozen in North America.  It is a bird of the Polar regions--even\r\nthe most remote--and in the dead of winter it is found within the Arctic\r\ncircle, on both Continents--although at the same season it also wanders\r\nfarther south.  It dwells upon the Barren Grounds as well as in wooded\r\ndistricts.  In the former it squats upon the snow, where its peculiar\r\ncolour often prevents it from being noticed by the passing hunter.\r\nNature has furnished it with every protection from the cold.  Its\r\nplumage is thick, closely matted, and downy, and it is feathered to the\r\nvery eyes--so that its legs appear as large as those of a good-sized\r\ndog.  The bill, too, is completely hidden under a mass of feathers that\r\ncover its face, and not even a point of its whole body is exposed.\r\n\r\nThe owl is usually looked upon as a night-bird, and in Southern\r\nlatitudes it is rarely seen by day; but the owls of the Northern regions\r\ndiffer from their congeners in this respect.  They hunt by day, even\r\nduring the bright hours of noon.  Were it not so, how could they exist\r\nin the midst of an Arctic summer, when the days are months in duration?\r\nHere we have another example of the manner in which Nature trains her\r\nwild creatures to adapt themselves to their situation.\r\n\r\nAt least a dozen species of owls frequent the territory of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company--the largest of which is the cinereous owl, whose wings have\r\na spread of nearly five feet.  Some species migrate south on the\r\napproach of winter; while several, as the snowy owl, remain to prey upon\r\nthe ptarmigan, the hares, and other small quadrupeds, who, like\r\nthemselves, choose that dreary region for their winter home.\r\n\r\nOur travellers, as I have said, stood watching the owl as it soared\r\nsilently through the heavens.  Francois had thrown his gun across his\r\nleft arm, in hopes he might get a shot at it; but the bird--a shy one at\r\nall times--kept away out of range; and, after circling once or twice\r\nover the hill, uttered a loud cry and flew off.\r\n\r\nIts cry resembled the moan of a human being in distress; and its effect\r\nupon the minds of our travellers, in the state they then were, was far\r\nfrom being pleasant.  They watched the bird with despairing looks, until\r\nit was lost against the white background of a snow-covered hill.\r\n\r\nThey had noticed that the owl appeared to be just taking flight when\r\nthey first saw it.  It must have risen up from the hill upon which they\r\nwere; and they once more ran their eyes along the level summit, curious\r\nto know where it had been perched that they had not seen it.  No doubt,\r\nreflected they, it had been near enough, but its colour had rendered it\r\nundistinguishable from the snow.\r\n\r\n\"What a pity!\" exclaimed Francois.\r\n\r\nWhile making these reflections, and sweeping their glances around, an\r\nobject caught their eyes that caused some of them to ejaculate and\r\nsuddenly raise their guns.  This object was near the centre of the\r\nsummit table, and at first sight appeared to be only a lump of snow; but\r\nupon closer inspection, two little round spots of a dark colour, and\r\nabove these two elongated black marks, could be seen.  Looking steadily,\r\nthe eye at length traced the outlines of an animal, that sat in a\r\ncrouching attitude.  The round spots were its eyes, and the black marks\r\nabove them were tips of a pair of very long ears.  All the rest of its\r\nbody was covered with a soft white fur, hardly to be distinguished from\r\nthe snow upon which it rested.\r\n\r\nThe form and colour of the animal, but more especially its long erect\r\nears, made it easy for them to tell what it was.  All of them saw it was\r\na hare.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" continued Norman, as soon as he saw it, \"keep still all of you--\r\nleave it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do?\" demanded Basil.  \"Can we not assist you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" was the reply, uttered in a whisper, \"stay where you are.  Keep\r\nthe dog quiet.  I'll manage puss, if the owl hasn't scared her too\r\nbadly.  That scream has started her out of her form.  I'm certain she\r\nwasn't that way before.  Maybe she'll sit it out.  Lucky the sun's\r\nhigh--don't move a step.  Have the dog ready, but hold him tight, and\r\nkeep a sharp look out if she bolts.\"\r\n\r\nAfter giving these instructions, that were all uttered quickly and in an\r\nunder tone, Norman moved off, with his gun carried across his arm.  He\r\ndid not move in the direction of the hare, but rather as if he was going\r\nfrom her.  His course, however, bent gradually into a circle of which\r\nthe hare was the centre--the diameter being the full breadth of the\r\nsummit level, which was about three hundred yards.  In this circle he\r\nwalked round and round, keeping his eye fixed upon the crouching animal.\r\nWhen he had nearly completed one circumference, he began to shorten the\r\ndiameter--so that the curve which he was now following was a spiral one,\r\nand gradually drawing nearer to the hare.  The latter kept watching him\r\nas he moved--curiosity evidently mingling with her fears.  Fortunately,\r\nas Norman had said, the sun was nearly in the vertex of the heavens, and\r\nhis own body cast very little shadow upon the snow.  Had it been\r\notherwise, the hare would have been frightened at the moving shadow, and\r\nwould have sprung out of her form, before he could have got within\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nWhen he had made some four or five circuits, Norman moved slower and\r\nslower, and then stopped nearly opposite to where the others were.\r\nThese stood watching him with beating hearts, for they knew that the\r\nlife of Marengo, and perhaps their own as well, depended on the shot.\r\nNorman had chosen his place, so that in case the hare bolted, she might\r\nrun towards them, and give them the chance of a flying shot.  His gun\r\nwas already at his shoulder--his finger rested on the trigger, and the\r\nboys were expecting the report, when again the shadow of a bird flitted\r\nover the snow, a loud human-like scream sounded in their ears, and the\r\nhare was seen to spring up, and stretch her long legs in flight.  At the\r\nsame instant the great snowy owl was observed wheeling above, and\r\nthreatening to pounce upon the fleeing animal!\r\n\r\nThe hare ran in a side-direction, but it brought her as she passed\r\nwithin range of the party by the sledge.  The owl kept above her as she\r\nran.  A dozen leaps was all the hare ever made.  A loud crack was heard,\r\nand she was seen to spring up and fall back upon the snow, dead as a\r\ndoornail.  Like an echo another crack followed--a wild scream rang\r\nthrough the air, and the great white owl fell fluttering to the earth.\r\nThe reports were not of a rifle.  They were the louder detonations of a\r\nshot-gun.  All eyes were turned towards Francois, who, like a little\r\ngod, stood enveloped in a halo of blue smoke.  Francois was the hero of\r\nthe hour.\r\n\r\nMarengo rushed forward and seized the struggling owl, that snapped its\r\nbill at him like a watch-man's rattle.  But Marengo did not care for\r\nthat; and seizing its head in his teeth, gave it a crunch that at once\r\nput an end to its flapping.\r\n\r\nMarengo was reprieved, and he seemed to know it, as he bounded over the\r\nsnow, waving his tail, and barking like a young fool.\r\n\r\nThey all ran up to the hare, which proved to be the \"Polar hare\" (_Lepus\r\nglacialis_), and one of the largest of its species--not less than\r\nfifteen pounds in weight.  Its fur, soft and white like swan-down, was\r\nstained with red blood.  It was not quite dead.  Its little heart yet\r\nbeat faintly, and the light of life was still shining from its beautiful\r\nhoney-coloured eyes.  Both it and the owl were taken up and carried to\r\nthe sledge, which was once more attached to Marengo, as the party\r\nintended to go forward and halt under the shelter of the hill.\r\n\r\n\"There must be some wood in this quarter,\" remarked Norman: \"I never\r\nknew this sort of hare far from timber.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said Lucien, \"the Polar hare feeds upon willows, arbutus, and\r\nthe Labrador tea-plant.  Some of these kinds must be near.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they were speaking, they had reached the brow of the hill, on the\r\nopposite side from where they had ascended.  On looking into the valley\r\nbelow, to their great joy they beheld some clumps of willows, and\r\ngood-sized trees of poplar, birch, and spruce-pine (_Pinus alba_), and\r\npassing down the hill, the travellers soon stood in their midst.\r\nPresently was heard the chipping sound of an axe and crash of falling\r\ntimber, and in a few moments after a column of smoke was seen soaring up\r\nout of the valley, and curling cheerfully towards the bright blue sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE JUMPING MOUSE AND THE ERMINE.\r\n\r\nLarge as the hare was, she would have made but a meal for our four\r\nhungry voyageurs, had they eaten at will.  By Lucien's advice, however,\r\nthey restrained themselves, and half of her was left for supper, when\r\nthe \"cook\" promised to make them hare-soup.  The head, feet, and other\r\nspare bits, fell to Marengo's share.  The owl, whose flesh was almost as\r\nwhite as its plumage, and, as Norman well knew, most delicate eating,\r\nwas reserved for to-morrow's breakfast.\r\n\r\nThey had pitched their tent with the intention of remaining at that\r\nplace all night, and continuing their journey next day; but, as it still\r\nwanted several hours of sunset, and the strength of all was considerably\r\nrecruited, they resolved to hunt about the neighbourhood as long as they\r\nhad light.  It was of great importance that they should procure more\r\ngame.  The owl would make but a spare breakfast, and after that where\r\nwas the next meal to come from?  They had had a temporary relief, and\r\nwhile their strength lasted, they must use every effort to procure a\r\nfurther supply.  The valley in which their new camp was placed looked\r\nwell for game.  It was a sort of oasis in the Barren Grounds.  There was\r\na lake and a considerable skirting of timber around it--consisting, as\r\nwe have said, of willows, poplars, spruce-pine, and dwarf birch-trees\r\n(_Betula nana_).  The Alpine arbutus, whose berries are the food of many\r\nspecies of animals, also grew upon the side of the hills; and the\r\nLabrador tea-plant (_Ledum palustre_) was found upon the low ground\r\naround the lake.  The leaves of this last is a favourite food of the\r\nPolar hare, and our voyageurs had no doubt but that there were many of\r\nthese animals in the neighbourhood.  Indeed, they had better evidence\r\nthan conjecture, for they saw numerous hare-tracks in the snow.  There\r\nwere tracks of other animals too, for it is a well-known fact that where\r\none kind exists, at least two or three others will be found in the same\r\nhabitat--all being connected together by a \"chain of destruction.\"\r\n\r\nA singular illustration of this was afforded to Lucien, who remained at\r\nthe camp while the rest went out hunting.  He had gathered some of the\r\nleaves of the Labrador tea, and was drying them over the coals,\r\nintending to cheer his comrades with a cup of this beverage after\r\nsupper.  The hare-soup was boiling, and the \"cook\" sat listening to the\r\ncheerful sounds that issued from the pot--now and then taking off the\r\nlid to examine its savoury contents, and give them a stir.  He would\r\nthen direct his attention to the tea-leaves that were parching in the\r\nfrying-pan; and, having shifted them a little, felt himself at liberty\r\nto look about for a minute or two.\r\n\r\nOn one of these occasions, while glancing up, his attention was\r\nattracted to an object which appeared upon the snow at a short distance\r\nfrom where he sat.  A wreath of snow, that had formed under the shelter\r\nof the hill, extended all around its base, presenting a steep front in\r\nevery direction.  This front was only two or three feet in height; but\r\nthe top surface of the wreath was many yards wide--in fact, it extended\r\nback until it became blended with the slope of the hill.  It was smooth\r\nand nearly level, but the hill above was steep, and somewhat rough and\r\nrocky.  The steep front of the wreath came down within half-a-dozen\r\npaces of the fire where Lucien was seated; and it was upon the top or\r\nscarpment of it that the object appeared that had drawn his attention.\r\nIt was a small creature, but it was in motion, and thus had caught his\r\neye.\r\n\r\nA single glance showed him that the little animal was a mouse, but of a\r\nsomewhat singular species.  It was about the size of the common mouse,\r\nbut quite different in colour.  The upper half of its body was of a\r\nlight mahogany tint, while the lower half, including the legs and feet,\r\nwere of a milky whiteness.  It was, in fact, the \"white-footed mouse\"\r\n(_Mus leucopus_), one of the most beautiful of its kind.\r\n\r\nHere and there above the surface of the snow protruded the tops of\r\narbutus-trees; and the little creature was passing from one of these to\r\nthe other, in search, no doubt, of the berries that remain upon these\r\ntrees all the winter.  Sometimes it ran from point to point like any\r\nother mouse, but now and then it would rear itself on its hind-legs, and\r\nleap several feet at a single bound!  In this it evidently assisted\r\nitself by pressing its tail--in which it possesses muscular power--\r\nagainst the snow.  This peculiar mode of progression has obtained for it\r\nthe name of the \"jumping mouse,\" and among the Indians \"deer\"-mouse,\r\nbecause its leap reminds them of the bounding spring of the deer.  But\r\nthere are still other species of \"jumping mice\" in America that possess\r\nthis power to a greater degree even than the _Mus leucopus_.\r\n\r\nLucien watched its motions without attempting to interfere with it,\r\nuntil it had got nearly out of sight.  He did not desire to do injury to\r\nthe little creature, nor was he curious to obtain it, as he had already\r\nmet with many specimens, and examined them to his satisfaction.  He had\r\nceased to think of it, and would, perhaps, never have thought of it\r\nagain, but, upon turning his eyes in the opposite direction, he observed\r\nanother animal upon the snow.  This creature had a far different aspect\r\nfrom the mouse.  Its body was nearly a foot in length, although not much\r\nthicker than that of the other!  Its legs were short, but strong, and\r\nits forehead broad and arched convexly.  It had a tail more than half\r\nthe length of the body, hairy, and tapering like that of a cat.  Its\r\nform was the well-known form of the weasel, and it was, in fact, a\r\nspecies of weasel.  It was the celebrated _ermine (Mustela erminea_),\r\ncelebrated for its soft and beautiful fur, so long prized as an ornament\r\nfor the robes of the rich.  It was white all over, with the exception of\r\nits tail; and that, for about an inch or so at the tip, was covered with\r\nblack silky hair.  On some parts of the body, too, the white was tinged\r\nwith a primrose yellow; but this tinge is not found in all animals of\r\nthis species, as some individuals are pure white.  Of course it was now\r\nin its winter \"robes;\" but in the summer it changes to a colour that\r\ndoes not differ much from that of the common weasel.\r\n\r\nWhen Lucien first saw it, it was running along the top of the wreath,\r\nand coming from the same direction from which the mouse had come.  Now\r\nand then it paused awhile, and then ran on again.  Lucien observed that\r\nit kept its nose to the ground, and as it drew nearer he saw that it was\r\nfollowing on the same path which the other had taken.  To his\r\nastonishment he perceived that it was _trailing the mouse_!  Wherever\r\nthe latter had doubled or made a _detour_, the ermine followed the\r\ntrack; and where the mouse had given one of its long leaps, there the\r\nermine would stop, and, after beating about until it struck the trail\r\nagain, would resume its onward course at a gallop.  Its manoeuvres were\r\nexactly like those of a hound upon the fresh trail of a fox!\r\n\r\nLucien now looked abroad to discover the mouse.  It was still in sight\r\nfar off upon the snow, and, as Lucien could see, busily gnawing at the\r\narbutus, quite unconscious that its _greatest_ enemy was so near.  I say\r\ngreatest enemy, for the _Mus leucopus_ is the _natural_ prey of the\r\n_Mustela erminea_.\r\n\r\nThe mouse was soon made aware of the dangerous proximity, but not until\r\nthe ermine had got within a few feet of it.  When it perceived the\r\nlatter it shrunk, at first, among the leaves of the arbutus; but seeing\r\nthere would be no protection there--as the other was still springing\r\nforward to seize it--it leaped up, and endeavoured to escape by flight.\r\nIts flight appeared to be in alternate jumps and runs, but the chase was\r\nnot a long one.  The ermine was as active as a cat, and, after a few\r\nskips, its claws were struck into the mouse.  There was a short, slender\r\nsqueak, and then a \"crunch,\" like the cracking of a hazel-nut.  This\r\nlast sound was produced by the teeth of the ermine breaking through the\r\nskull of its victim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE ARCTIC FOX AND WHITE WOLF.\r\n\r\nLucien turned round to get hold of his rifle, intending to punish the\r\nermine, although the little creature, in doing what it did, had only\r\nobeyed a law of nature.  But the boy had also another design in killing\r\nit: he wished to compare it with some ermines he had seen while\r\ntravelling upon Lake Winnipeg, which, as he thought, were much larger--\r\none that he had caught having measured more than a foot in length,\r\nwithout including the tail.  He wished, also, to make some comparison\r\nbetween it and the common weasel; for in its _winter dress_, in the\r\nsnowy regions, the latter very much resembles the ermine; and, indeed,\r\nthe trappers make no distinction between them.\r\n\r\nWith these ideas Lucien had grasped his gun, and was raising himself to\r\ncreep a little nearer, when his eye was arrested by the motions of\r\nanother creature coming along the top of the wreath.  This last was a\r\nsnow-white animal, with long, shaggy fur, sharp-pointed snout, erect\r\nears, and bushy tail.  Its aspect was fox-like, and its movements and\r\nattitudes had all that semblance of cunning and caution so\r\ncharacteristic of these animals.  Well might it, for it _was_ a fox--the\r\nbeautiful white fox of the Arctic regions.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly supposed that there are but two or three kinds of foxes\r\nin America; and that these are only varieties of the European species.\r\n\r\nThis is an erroneous idea, as there are nearly a dozen varieties\r\nexisting in North America, although they may be referred to a less\r\nnumber of species.  There is the Arctic fox, which is confined to the\r\ncold Northern regions, and which in winter is white.\r\n\r\nThe \"sooty fox\" is a variety of the \"Arctic,\" distinguished from it only\r\nby its colour, which is of a uniform blackish brown.\r\n\r\nThe \"American fox\" (_Vulpes fulvus_), or, as it is commonly called, the\r\n\"red fox,\" has been long supposed to be the same as the European red\r\nfox.  This is erroneous.  They differ in many points; and, what is\r\nsomewhat curious, these points of difference are similar to those that\r\nexist between the European and American wolves, as already given.\r\n\r\nThe \"cross fox\" is supposed by the Indians and some naturalists to be\r\nonly a variety of the last.  It derives its name from its having two\r\ndark stripes crossing each other upon the shoulders.  Its fur from this\r\ncircumstance, and perhaps because the animal is scarce, is more prized\r\nthan that of the red variety.  When a single skin of the latter is worth\r\nonly fifteen shillings, one of the cross fox will bring as much as five\r\nguineas.\r\n\r\nAnother variety of the red fox, and a much more rare one, is the\r\n\"black,\" or \"silver\" fox.  The skins of these command six times the\r\nprice of any other furs found in America, with the exception of the\r\nsea-otter.  The animal itself is so rare that only a few fall into the\r\nhands of the Hudson's Bay Company in a season; and Mr Nicholay, the\r\ncelebrated London furrier, asserts that a single skin will fetch from\r\nten to forty guineas, according to quality.  A remarkable cloak, or\r\npelisse, belonging to the Emperor of Russia, and made out of the skins\r\nof silver-foxes, was exhibited in the Great London Exposition of 1851.\r\nIt was made entirely from the neck-part of the skins--the only part of\r\nthe silver-fox which is pure black.  This cloak was valued at 3400\r\npounds; though Mr Nicholay considers this an exaggerated estimate, and\r\nstates its true value to be not over 1000 pounds.  George the Fourth had\r\na lining of black fox-skins worth 1000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe \"grey fox\" is a more southern species than any already described.\r\nIts proper home is the temperate zone covered by the United States;\r\nalthough it extends its range into the southern parts of Canada.  In the\r\nUnited States it is the most common kind, although in that district\r\nthere is also a \"red fox,\" different from the _Vulpes fulvus_ already\r\nnoticed; and which, no doubt, is the red fox of Europe, introduced by\r\nthe early colonists of America.\r\n\r\nStill another species, the smallest and perhaps the most interesting of\r\nany, is the \"kit fox.\"  This little creature is an inhabitant of the\r\nprairies, where it makes its burrows far from any wood.  It is extremely\r\nshy, and the swiftest animal in the prairie country--outrunning even the\r\nantelope!\r\n\r\nWhen Lucien saw the fox he thought no more of the ermine, but drew back\r\nand crouched down, in hopes he might get a shot at the larger animal.\r\nHe knew well that the flesh of the Arctic fox is highly esteemed as\r\nfood, particularly by persons situated as he and his companions were,\r\nand he hoped to be able to add it to their larder.\r\n\r\nWhen first seen it was coming towards him, though not in a direct line.\r\nIt was engaged in hunting, and, with its nose to the snow, was running\r\nin zig-zag lines, \"quartering\" the ground like a pointer dog.  Presently\r\nit struck the trail of the ermine, and with a yelp of satisfaction\r\nfollowed it.  This of course brought it close past where Lucien was;\r\nbut, notwithstanding his eagerness to fire, it moved so rapidly along\r\nthe trail that he was unable to take sight upon it.  It did not halt for\r\na moment; and, as Lucien's gun was a rifle, he knew that a flying shot\r\nwould be an uncertain one.  In the belief, therefore, that the fox would\r\nstop soon--at all events when it came up with the ermine--he restrained\r\nhimself from firing, and waited.\r\n\r\nIt ran on, still keeping the track of the ermine.  The latter, hitherto\r\nbusy with his own prey, did not see the fox until it was itself seen,\r\nwhen, dropping the half-eaten mouse, it reared up on its hindquarters\r\nlike a squirrel or a monkey, at the same time spitting as spitefully as\r\nany other weasel could have done.  In a moment, however, it changed its\r\ntactics--for the open jaws of the fox were within a few paces of it--and\r\nafter making a short quick run along the surface, it threw up its\r\nhindquarters, and plunged head-foremost into the snow!  The fox sprang\r\nforward, and flinging his brush high in air, shot after like an arrow!\r\n\r\nBoth had now disappeared from Lucien's sight.  For a moment the surface\r\nof the snow was disturbed above the spot where they had gone down, but\r\nthe next moment all was still, and no evidence existed that a living\r\ncreature had been there, except the tracks, and the break the two\r\ncreatures had made in going down.  Lucien ran forward until he was\r\nwithin a few yards of the place, and stood watching the hole, with his\r\nrifle ready--thinking that the fox, at least, would soon come up again.\r\n\r\nHe had waited for nearly five minutes, looking steadily at this point,\r\nwhen his eye was attracted by a movement under the snow, at a\r\nconsiderable distance, quite fifty paces, from where he stood.  The\r\nfrozen crust was seen to upheave; and, the next moment, the head of the\r\nfox, and afterwards his whole body, appeared above the surface.  Lucien\r\nsaw that the ermine lay transversely between his jaws, and was quite\r\ndead!  He was about to fire, but the fox, suddenly perceiving him, shot\r\noff like an arrow, carrying his prey along with him.  He was soon out of\r\nreach, and Lucien, seeing that he had lost his chance, was about to\r\nreturn to the fire, when, all at once, the fox was observed to stop,\r\nturn suddenly in his tracks, and run off in a new direction!  Lucien\r\nlooked beyond to ascertain the cause of this strange manoeuvre.  That\r\nwas soon ascertained.  Coming down from among the rocks was a large\r\nanimal--five times the fox's size--but in other respects not unlike him.\r\nIt was also of a snow-white colour, with long hair, bushy tail, and\r\nshort erect ears, but its aspect was not to be mistaken.  It was the\r\ngreat _white wolf_.\r\n\r\nWhen Lucien first saw this new-comer, the latter had just espied the\r\nfox, and was about stretching out into a gallop towards him.  The fox,\r\n_watching backwards_ as he ran, had not seen the wolf, until the latter\r\nwas within a few springs of him; and now when he had turned, and both\r\nwere in full chase, there was not over twenty yards between them.  The\r\ndirection in which they ran would bring them near to Lucien; and so they\r\ncame, and passed him--neither of them seeming to heed his presence.\r\nThey had not got many yards farther, before Lucien perceived that the\r\nwolf was fast closing on the fox, and would soon capture him.  Believing\r\nhe would then stop, so as to offer him a fairer chance for a shot,\r\nLucien followed.  The wolf, however, had noticed him coming after, and\r\nalthough the next moment he closed his great jaws upon the fox, he did\r\nnot pause for a single instant, but, lifting the latter clear up from\r\nthe ground, ran on without the slightest apparent diminution of speed!\r\n\r\nReynard was seen to struggle and kick, while he squeaked like a shot\r\npuppy; but his cries each moment grew feebler, and his struggles soon\r\ncame to an end.  The wolf held him transversely in his jaws--just as he\r\nhimself but the moment before had carried the ermine.\r\n\r\nLucien saw there was no use in following them, as the wolf ran on with\r\nhis prey.  With some disappointment, therefore, he was about to return\r\nto the fire, where, to add to his mortification, he knew he would find\r\nhis tea-leaves parched to a cinder.  He lingered a moment, however, with\r\nhis eyes still fixed upon the departing wolf that was just about to\r\ndisappear over the crest of a ridge.  The fox was still in his jaws, but\r\nno longer struggling.  Reynard looked limber and dead, as his legs swung\r\nloosely on both sides of the wolf's head.  Lucien at that moment saw the\r\nlatter suddenly stop in his career, and then drop down upon the surface\r\nof the snow as if dead!  He fell with his victim in his jaws, and lay\r\nhalf doubled up, and quite still.\r\n\r\nThis strange action would have been a difficult thing for Lucien to\r\nexplain, but, almost at the same instant in which he observed it, a puff\r\nof blue smoke shot up over the ridge, and quickly following was heard\r\nthe sharp crack of a rifle.  Then a head with its cap of raccoon skin\r\nappeared above the snow, and Lucien, recognising the face of Basil, ran\r\nforward to meet him.\r\n\r\nBoth soon stood over the body of the dead wolf, wondering at what they\r\nsaw; but Basil, far more than Lucien--for the latter already knew the\r\ncircumstances of that strange scene of death.  First there was the great\r\ngaunt body of the wolf stretched along the snow, and quite dead.\r\nCrossways in his mouth was the fox, just as he had been carried off; and\r\nacross the jaws of the latter, lay the long worm-like body of the\r\nermine, still retaining between its teeth the half-devoured remains of\r\nthe white-footed mouse!  A very chain of destroyers!  These creatures\r\ndied as they had lived, preying one upon the other!  Of all four the\r\nlittle mouse alone was an innocent victim.  The other three, though\r\nmorally guilty by the laws of man, yet were only acting in obedience to\r\nthe laws of Nature and necessity.  Man himself obeys a similar law, as\r\nBasil had just shown.  Philosophise as we will, we cannot comprehend why\r\nit is so--why Nature requires the sacrifice of one of her creatures for\r\nthe sustenance of another.  But although we cannot understand the cause,\r\nwe must not condemn the fact as it exists; nor must we suppose, as some\r\ndo, that the destruction of God's creatures for our necessities\r\nconstitutes a crime.  They who think so, and who, in consistency with\r\ntheir doctrines, confine themselves to what they term \"vegetable\" food,\r\nare at best but shallow reasoners.  They have not studied Nature very\r\nclosely, else would they know that every time they pluck up a parsnip,\r\nor draw their blade across the leaf of a lettuce, they cause pain and\r\ndeath!  How much pain we cannot tell; but that the plant feels, as well\r\nas the animal, we can clearly _prove_.  Probably it feels less, and it\r\nmay be each kind of plant differs from others in the amount, according\r\nto its higher or lower organism.  Probably its amount of pleasure--its\r\ncapability of enjoyment--is in a direct proportion to the pain which it\r\nendures; and it is highly probable that this double line of ratios runs\r\nin an ascending scale throughout the vegetable kingdom, gradually\r\njoining on to what is more strictly termed the \"animal.\"  But these\r\nmysteries of life, my young friend, will be interesting studies for you\r\nwhen your mind becomes matured.  Perhaps it may be your fortune to\r\nunravel some of them, for the benefit of your fellow-men.  I feel\r\nsatisfied that you will not only be a student of Nature, but one of her\r\ngreat teachers; you will far surpass the author of this little book in\r\nyour knowledge of Nature's laws; but it will always be a happiness to\r\nhim to reflect, that, when far advanced upon the highway of science, you\r\nwill look back to him as one you had passed upon the road, and who\r\n_pointed you to the path_.\r\n\r\nThough Basil had shot the wolf, it was plain that it was not the first\r\nnor yet the second time he had discharged his rifle since leaving the\r\ncamp.  From his game-bag protruded the curving claws and wing-tips of a\r\ngreat bird.  In one hand he carried a white hare--not the Polar hare--\r\nbut a much smaller kind, also an inhabitant of these snowy regions; and\r\nover his shoulders was slung a fierce-looking creature, the great\r\nwild-cat or lynx of America (_Lynx Canadensis_).  The bird in his bag\r\nwas the golden eagle (_Aquila chrysaetos_), one of the few feathered\r\ncreatures that brave the fierce winter of a northern climate, and does\r\nnot migrate, like its congeners the \"white-head\" and the osprey, to more\r\nsouthern regions.\r\n\r\nBasil had returned alone--for the three, Basil, Norman, and Francois,\r\nhad taken different directions at setting cut.  This they had done, in\r\norder to have as great a number of chances as possible of finding the\r\ngame.  Norman came in a few minutes after, bearing a whole deer upon his\r\nshoulders--a glad sight that was--and, a short interval having passed,\r\nFrancois's \"hurrah\" sounded upon their ears, and Francois himself was\r\nseen coming up the valley loaded like a little donkey with two bunches\r\nof large snow-white birds.\r\n\r\nThe camp now exhibited a cheering sight.  Such a variety was never seen\r\neven in the larder of a palace kitchen.  The ground was strewed with\r\nanimals like a dead menagerie.  There were no less than a dozen kinds\r\nupon it!\r\n\r\nThe hare-soup was now quite ready, and was accordingly served up by\r\nLucien in the best style.  Lucien had dried a fresh \"grist\" of the\r\ntea-leaves, and a cheering cup followed; and then the party all sat\r\naround their log-fire, while each of them detailed the history of his\r\nexperience since parting with the others.\r\n\r\nFrancois was the first to relate what had befallen him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE JERFALCON AND THE WHITE GROUSE.\r\n\r\n\"Mine,\" began Francois, \"was a bird-adventure, as you all see--though\r\nwhat kind of birds I've shot I can't tell.  One of them's a hawk, I'm\r\nsure; but it's a _white_ hawk, and that I never saw before.  The rest, I\r\nsuppose, are _white_ partridges.  Everything appears to be white here.\r\nWhat are they, Luce?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right about this first,\" answered Lucien, taking up one of the\r\nbirds which Francois had brought back with him, and which was white all\r\nbut a few spots of clove-brown upon its back.  \"This is a hawk, as you\r\nmay tell, by its appearance, or rather I should say a `falcon,' for you\r\nmust know there is a difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"What difference?\" demanded Francois, with some eagerness of manner.\r\n\r\n\"Why the principal difference is the formation of their beaks or bills.\r\nThe bills of the true falcons are stronger, and have a notch in the\r\nlower mandible answering to a tooth in the upper one.  Their nostrils,\r\ntoo, are differently formed.  But another point of distinction is found\r\nin their habits.  Both feed on warm-blooded animals, and neither will\r\neat carrion.  In this respect the hawks and falcons are alike.  Both\r\ntake their prey upon the wing; but herein lies the difference.  The\r\nhawks capture it by skimming along horizontally or obliquely, and\r\npicking it up as they pass; whereas the true falcons `pounce' down upon\r\nit from above, and in a line nearly vertical.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then this must be a true falcon,\" interrupted Francois, \"for I saw the\r\ngentleman do that very thing; and beautifully he did it, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a falcon,\" continued Lucien; \"and of the many species of hawks\r\nwhich inhabit North America--over twenty in all--it is one of the\r\nboldest and handsomest.  I don't wonder you never saw it before; for it\r\nis truly a bird of the Northern regions, and does not come so far south\r\nas the territory of the United States, much less into Louisiana.  It is\r\nfound in North Europe, Greenland, and Iceland, and has been seen as far\r\nnorth on both continents as human beings have travelled.  It is known by\r\nthe name of `jerfalcon,' or `gyrfalcon,' but its zoological name is\r\n_Falco Islandicus_.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Indians here,\" interposed Norman, \"call it by a name that means\r\n`winter bird,' or `winterer'--I suppose, because it is one of the few\r\nthat stay in these parts all the year round, and is therefore often\r\nnoticed by them in winter time.  The traders sometimes call it the\r\n`speckled partridge-hawk,' for there are some of them more spotted than\r\nthis one is.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said Lucien; \"the young ones are nearly of a brown colour, and\r\nthey first become spotted or mottled after a year or two.  They are\r\nseveral years old before they get the white plumage, and very few\r\nindividuals are seen of a pure white all over, though there are some\r\nwithout a spot.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued the naturalist, \"it is the jerfalcon; and those other\r\nbirds which you call `white partridges,' are the _very_ creatures upon\r\nwhich it preys.  So _you_ have killed both the tyrant and his victims.\r\nThey are not partridges though, but grouse--that species known as\r\n`willow-grouse' (_Tetrao saliceti_).\"\r\n\r\nAnd as Lucien said this, he began to handle the birds, which were of a\r\nbeautiful white all over, with the exception of the tail-feathers.\r\nThese last were pitch-black.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!\" exclaimed Lucien, in some surprise, \"you have two kinds here!\r\nWere they all together when you shot them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Francois; \"one I shot along with the hawk out in the open\r\nground.  All the others I killed upon a tree in a piece of woods that I\r\nfell in with.  There's no difference between them that I can see.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can,\" said Lucien, \"although I acknowledge they all look very\r\nmuch alike.  Both are feathered to the toes--both have the black\r\nfeathers in the tail--and the bills of both are black; but if you\r\nobserve closely, this kind--the willow-grouse--has the bill much\r\nstronger and less flattened.  Besides, it is a larger bird than the\r\nother, which is the `rock-grouse' (_Tetrao rupestris_).  Both are\r\nsometimes, though erroneously, called `ptarmigan;' but they are not the\r\ntrue ptarmigan (_Tetrao mutus_)--such as exist in North Europe--though\r\nthese last are also to be met with in the Northern parts of America.\r\nThe ptarmigan are somewhat larger than either of these kinds, but in\r\nother respects differ but little from them.\r\n\r\n\"The habits of the `rock' and `willow' grouse are very similar.  They\r\nare both birds of the snowy regions, and are found as far north as has\r\nbeen explored.  The willow-grouse in winter keep more among the trees,\r\nand are oftener met with in wooded countries; whereas the others like\r\nbest to live in the open ground, and, from your statement, it appears\r\nyou found each kind in its favourite haunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Francois.  \"After leaving here, I kept down the valley,\r\nand was just crossing an open piece of high ground, when I espied the\r\nwhite hawk, or falcon as you call it, hovering in the air as I'd often\r\nseen hawks do.  Well, I stopped and hid behind a rock, thinking I might\r\nhave a chance to put a few drops into him.  All at once he appeared to\r\nstand still in the air, and, then closing his wings, shot down like an\r\narrow.  Just then I heard a loud `_whur-r-r_,' and up started a whole\r\ncovey of white partridges--grouse, I should say--the same as this you\r\ncall the `rock-grouse.'  I saw that the hawk had missed the whole of\r\nthem, and I marked them as they flew off.  They pitched about a hundred\r\nyards or so, and then went plunge under the snow--every one of them\r\nmaking a hole for itself just like where one had poked their foot in!  I\r\nguess, boys, this looked funny enough.  I thought I would be sure to get\r\na shot at some of these grouse as they came out again; so I walked\r\nstraight up to the holes they had made, and stood waiting.  I still saw\r\nthe hawk hovering in the air, about an hundred yards ahead of me.\r\n\r\n\"I was considering whether I ought to go farther on, and tramp the birds\r\nout of the snow; for I believed, of course, they were still under the\r\nplace where the holes were.  All at once I noticed a movement on the\r\ncrust of the snow right under where the hawk was flying, and then that\r\nindividual shot down to the spot, and disappeared under the snow!  At\r\nthe same instant, the crust broke in several places, and up came the\r\ngrouse one after another, and whirred off out of sight, without giving\r\nme any sort of a chance.  The hawk, however, had not come up yet; and I\r\nran forward, determined to take him as soon as he should make his\r\nappearance.  When I had got within shooting distance, up he fluttered to\r\nthe surface, and--what do you think?--he had one of the grouse\r\nstruggling in his claws!  I let him have the right barrel, and both he\r\nand grousy were knocked dead as a couple of door-nails!\r\n\r\n\"I thought I might fall in with the others again; and kept on in the\r\ndirection they had taken, which brought me at last to a piece of\r\nwoodland consisting of birches and willow-trees.  As I was walking along\r\nthe edge of this, I noticed one of the willows, at some distance off,\r\ncovered with great white things, that at first I took for flakes of\r\nsnow; but then I thought it curious that none of the other trees had the\r\nsame upon them.  As I came a little nearer, I noticed one of the things\r\nmoving, and then I saw they were birds, and very like the same I had\r\njust seen, and was then in search of.  So I crept in among the trees;\r\nand, after some dodging, got within beautiful shooting distance, and\r\ngave them both barrels.  There, you see the result!\"\r\n\r\nHere Francois triumphantly pointed to the pile of birds, which in all,\r\nwith the jerfalcon, counted four brace and a half.\r\n\r\nOne was the rock-grouse, which the falcon had itself killed, and the\r\nothers were willow-grouse, as Lucien had stated.  Francois now remained\r\nsilent, while Basil related his day's adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE HARE, THE LYNX, AND THE GOLDEN EAGLE.\r\n\r\n\"Frank,\" began he, \"has called his a `bird-adventure.'  I might give\r\nmine somewhat of the same title, for there was a bird mixed up with it--\r\nthe noblest of all birds--the eagle.  But you shall hear it.\r\n\r\n\"On leaving the camp, I went, as you all know, up the valley.  After\r\ntravelling for a quarter of a mile or so, I came upon a wide open\r\nbottom, where there were some scattered willows and clumps of dwarf\r\nbirch-trees.  As Luce had told me that such are the favourite food of\r\nthe American hare, or, as we call it in Louisiana, `rabbit,' I looked\r\nout for the sign of one, and, sure enough, I soon came upon a track,\r\nwhich I knew to be that of `puss.'  It was fresh enough, and I followed\r\nit.  It kept me meandering about for a long while, till at last I saw\r\nthat it took a straight course for some thick brushwood, with two or\r\nthree low birches growing out of it.  As I made sure of finding the game\r\nthere, I crept forward _very_ quietly, holding Marengo in the leash.\r\nBut the hare was not in the brush; and, after tramping all through it, I\r\nagain noticed the track where she had gone out on the opposite side.  I\r\nwas about starting forth to follow it, when all at once an odd-looking\r\ncreature made its appearance right before me.  It was that fellow\r\nthere!\"  And Basil pointed to the lynx.  \"I thought at first sight,\"\r\ncontinued he, \"it was our Louisiana wild-cat or bay lynx, as Luce calls\r\nit, for it is very like our cat; but I saw it was nearly twice as big,\r\nand more greyish in the fur.  Well, when I first sighted the creature,\r\nit was about an hundred yards off.  It hadn't seen me, though, for it\r\nwas not running away, but skulking along slowly--nearly crosswise to the\r\ncourse of the hare's track--and looking in a different direction to that\r\nin which I was.  I was well screened behind the bushes, and that, no\r\ndoubt, prevented it from noticing me.  At first I thought of running\r\nforward, and setting Marengo after it.  Then I determined on staying\r\nwhere I was, and watching it a while.  Perhaps it may come to a stop,\r\nreflected I, and let me creep within shot.  I remained, therefore,\r\ncrouching among the bushes, and kept the dog at my feet.\r\n\r\n\"As I continued to watch the cat, I saw that, instead of following a\r\nstraight line, it was moving in a circle!\r\n\r\n\"The diameter of this circle was not over an hundred yards; and in a\r\nvery short while the animal had got once round the circumference, and\r\ncame back to where I had first seen it.  It did not stop there, but\r\ncontinued on, though not in its old tracks.  It still walked in a\r\ncircle, but a much smaller one than before.  Both, however, had a common\r\ncentre; and, as I noticed that the animal kept its eyes constantly\r\nturned towards the centre, I felt satisfied that in that place would be\r\nfound the cause of its strange manoeuvring.  I looked to the centre.  At\r\nfirst I could see nothing--at least nothing that might be supposed to\r\nattract the cat.  There was a very small bush of willows, but they were\r\nthin.  I could see distinctly through them, and there was no creature\r\nthere, either in the bush or around it.  The snow lay white up to the\r\nroots of the willows, and I thought that a mouse could hardly have found\r\nshelter among them, without my seeing it from where I stood.  Still I\r\ncould not explain the odd actions of the lynx, upon any other principle\r\nthan that it was in the pursuit of game; and I looked again, and\r\ncarefully examined every inch of the ground as my eyes passed over it.\r\nThis time I discovered what the animal was after.  Close in to the\r\nwillows appeared two little parallel streaks of a dark colour, just\r\nrising above the surface of the snow.  I should not have noticed them\r\nhad there not been two of them, and these slanting in the same\r\ndirection.  They had caught my eyes before, but I had taken them for the\r\npoints of broken willows.  I now saw that they were the ears of some\r\nanimal, and I thought that once or twice they moved slightly while I was\r\nregarding them.  After looking at them steadily for a time, I made out\r\nthe shape of a little head underneath.  It was white, but there was a\r\nround dark spot in the middle, which I knew to be an eye.  There was no\r\nbody to be seen.  That was under the snow, but it was plain enough that\r\nwhat I saw was the head of a hare.  At first I supposed it to be a Polar\r\nhare--such as we had just killed--but the tracks I had followed were not\r\nthose of the Polar hare.  Then I remembered that the `rabbit' of the\r\nUnited States also turns white in the winter of the Northern regions.\r\nThis, then, must be the American rabbit, thought I.\r\n\r\n\"Of course my reflections did not occupy all the time I have taken in\r\ndescribing them.  Only a moment or so.  All the while the lynx was\r\nmoving round and round the circle, but still getting nearer to the hare\r\nthat appeared eagerly to watch it.  I remembered how Norman had\r\nmanoeuvred to get within shot of the Polar hare; and I now saw the very\r\nsame _ruse_ being practised by a dumb creature, that is supposed to have\r\nno other guide than instinct.  But I had seen the `bay lynx' of\r\nLouisiana do some `dodges' as cunning as that,--such as claying his feet\r\nto make the hounds lose the scent, and, after running backwards and\r\nforwards upon a fallen log, leap into the tops of trees, and get off in\r\nthat way.  Believing that his Northern cousin was just as artful as\r\nhimself,\" (here Basil looked significantly at the \"Captain,\") \"I did not\r\nso much wonder at the performance I now witnessed.  Nevertheless, I felt\r\na great curiosity to see it out.  But for this curiosity I could have\r\nshot the lynx every time he passed me on the nearer edge of the circle.\r\nRound and round he went, then, until he was not twenty feet from the\r\nhare, that, strange to say, seemed to regard this the worst of her\r\nenemies more with wonder than fear.  The lynx at length stopped\r\nsuddenly, brought his four feet close together, arched his back like an\r\nangry cat, and then with one immense bound, sprang forward upon his\r\nvictim.  The hare had only time to leap out of her form, and the second\r\nspring of the lynx brought him right upon the top of her.  I could hear\r\nthe child-like scream which the American rabbit always utters when thus\r\nseized; but the cloud of snow-spray raised above the spot prevented me\r\nfor a while from seeing either lynx or hare.  The scream was stifled in\r\na moment, and when the snow-spray cleared off, I saw that the lynx held\r\nthe hare under his paws, and that `puss' was quite dead.\r\n\r\n\"I was considering how I might best steal up within shooting distance,\r\nwhen, all at once, I heard another scream of a very different sort.  At\r\nthe same time a dark shadow passed over the snow.  I looked up, and\r\nthere, within fifty yards of the ground, a great big bird was wheeling\r\nabout.  I knew it to be an eagle from its shape; and at first I fancied\r\nit was a young one of the white-headed kind--for, as you are aware,\r\nthese do not have either the white head or tail until they are several\r\nyears old.  Its immense size, however, showed that it could not be one\r\nof these.  It must be the great `_golden' eagle_ of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nthought I.\r\n\r\n\"When I first noticed it, I fancied that it had been after the rabbit;\r\nand, seeing the latter pounced upon by another preying creature, had\r\nuttered its scream at being thus disappointed of its prey.  I expected,\r\ntherefore, to see it fly off.  To my astonishment it broke suddenly out\r\nof the circles in which it had been so gracefully wheeling, and, with\r\nanother scream wilder than before, darted down towards the lynx!\r\n\r\n\"The latter, on hearing the first cry of the eagle, had started, dropped\r\nhis prey, and looked up.  In the eagle he evidently recognised an\r\nantagonist, for his back suddenly became arched, his fur bristled up,\r\nhis short tail moved quickly from side to side, and he stood with\r\nglaring eyes, and claws ready to receive the attack.\r\n\r\n\"As the eagle came down, its legs and claws were thrown forward, and I\r\ncould then tell it was not a bald eagle, nor the great `Washington\r\neagle,' nor yet a fishing eagle of any sort, which both of these are.\r\nThe fishing eagles, as Lucien had told me, _have always naked legs_,\r\nwhile those of the true eagles are more feathered.  So were his, but\r\nbeyond the feathers I could see his great curved talons, as he struck\r\nforward at the lynx.  He evidently touched and wounded the animal, but\r\nthe wound only served to make it more angry; and I could hear it purring\r\nand spitting like a tom-cat, only far louder.  The eagle again mounted\r\nback into the air, but soon wheeled round and shot down a second time.\r\nThis time the lynx sprang forward to meet it, and I could hear the\r\nconcussion of their bodies as they came together.  I think the eagle\r\nmust have been crippled, so that it could not fly up again, for the\r\nfight from that time was carried on upon the ground.  The lynx seemed\r\nanxious to grasp some part of his antagonist's body--and at times I\r\nthought he had succeeded--but then he was beaten off again by the bird,\r\nthat fought furiously with wings, beak, and talons.  The lynx now\r\nappeared to be the attacking party, as I saw him repeatedly spring\r\nforward at the eagle, while the latter always received him upon its\r\nclaws, lying with its back upon the snow.  Both fur and feathers flew in\r\nevery direction, and sometimes the combatants were so covered with the\r\nsnow-spray that I could see neither of them.\r\n\r\n\"I watched the conflict for several minutes, until it occurred to me,\r\nthat my best time to get near enough for a shot was just while they were\r\nin the thick of it, and not likely to heed me.  I therefore moved\r\nsilently out of the bushes; and, keeping Marengo in the string, crept\r\nforward.  I had but the one bullet to give them, and with that I could\r\nnot shoot both; but I knew that the quadruped was eatable, and, as I was\r\nnot sure about the bird, I very easily made choice, and shot the lynx.\r\nTo my surprise the eagle did not fly _off_, and I now saw that one of\r\nits wings was disabled!  He was still strong enough, however, to scratch\r\nMarengo severely before the latter could master him.  As to the lynx, he\r\nhad been roughly handled.  His skin was torn in several places, and one\r\nof his eyes, as you see, regularly `gouged out.'\"\r\n\r\nHere Basil ended his narration; and after an interval, during which some\r\nfresh wood was chopped and thrown upon the fire, Norman, in turn,\r\ncommenced relating what had befallen him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE \"ALARM BIRD\" AND THE CARIBOU.\r\n\r\n\"There wasn't much `adventure' in my day's sport,\" said he, \"though I\r\nmight call it a `bird-adventure' too, for if it hadn't been for a bird I\r\nshouldn't have had it.  I shot a deer--that's all.  But maybe it would\r\nbe curious for you to know how I came to find the animal, so I'll tell\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing I did after leaving here was to climb the hill\r\nyonder,\"--here Norman pointed to a long hill that sloped up from the\r\nopposite shore of the lake, and which was the direction he had taken, as\r\nBasil and Francois had gone right and left.\r\n\r\n\"I saw neither bird, beast, nor track, until I had reached the top of\r\nthe hill.  There I got a good view of the country ahead.  I saw it was\r\nvery rocky, without a stick of timber, and did not look very promising\r\nfor game.  `It's no use going that way,' I says to myself; `I'll keep\r\nalong the ridge, above where Frank's gone.  He may drive some varmint\r\nout of the hollow, and I'll get a crack at it, as it comes over the\r\nhill.'\r\n\r\n\"I was about to turn to the left when I heard the skreek of a bird away\r\nahead of me.  I looked in that direction; and, sure enough, saw one\r\nwheeling about in the air, right above the rocky jumble with which the\r\ncountry was covered.\r\n\r\n\"Now it's a mighty curious bird that I saw.  It's a sort of an owl, but,\r\nI should say myself, there's a sprinkling of the hawk in it--for it's as\r\nmuch like the one as the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" interrupted Lucien, \"it was one of the day owls of these\r\nNorthern regions, some of which approach very near to the hawks, both in\r\nshape and habits.  This peculiarity arises from the fact of the long\r\nsummer day--of weeks in duration--within the Arctic circle, requiring\r\nthem to hunt for their prey, just as hawks do; and therefore Nature has\r\ngifted them with certain peculiarities that make them resemble these\r\nbirds.  They want the very broad faces and large tufted heads of the\r\ntrue owls; besides the ears, which in the latter are remarkable for\r\ntheir size, and also for being operculated, or with lids, in the former\r\nare not much larger than in other birds of prey.  The small hawk-owl\r\n(_Strix funerea_), which is altogether a Northern bird, is one of this\r\nkind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" continued Norman, \"what you say may be very true, cousin\r\nLuce; I only know that the bird I am speaking about is a mighty curious\r\nlittle creature.  It ain't bigger than a pigeon, and is of a\r\nmottled-brown colour; but what I call it curious for is this:--Whenever\r\nit sees any creature passing from place to place, it mounts up into the\r\nair, and hovers above them, keeping up a constant screeching, like the\r\nsqualling of a child--and that's anything but agreeable.  It does so,\r\nnot only in the neighbourhood of its nest--like the plover and some\r\nother birds--but it will sometimes follow a travelling party for hours\r\ntogether, and for miles across the country.  From this circumstance the\r\nIndians of these parts call it the `alarm bird,' or `bird of warning,'\r\nbecause it often makes them aware of the approach either of their\r\nenemies or of strangers.  Sometimes it alarms and startles the game,\r\nwhile the hunter is crawling up to it; and I have known it to bother\r\nmyself for a while of a day, when I was after grouse.  It's a great\r\nfavourite with the Indians though--as it often guides them to deer, or\r\nmusk-oxen, by its flying and screaming above where these animals are\r\nfeeding.\r\n\r\n\"Just in the same way it guided me.  I knew, from the movements of the\r\nbird, that there must be something among the rocks.  I couldn't tell\r\nwhat, but I hoped it would turn out to be some creature that was\r\neatable; so I changed my intention, and struck out for the place where\r\nit was.\r\n\r\n\"It was a good half-mile from the hill, and it cost me considerable\r\nclambering over the rocks, before I reached the ground.  I thought to\r\nget near enough to see what it was, without drawing the bird upon\r\nmyself, and I crouched from hummock to hummock; but the sharp-eyed\r\ncreature caught sight of me, and came screeching over my head.  I kept\r\non without noticing it; but as I was obliged to go round some large\r\nrocks, I lost the direction, and soon found myself wandering back into\r\nmy own trail.  I could do nothing, therefore, until the bird should\r\nleave me, and fly back to whatever had first set it a-going.  In order\r\nthat it might do so, I crept in under a big stone that jutted out, and\r\nlay quiet a bit, watching it.  It soon flew off, and commenced wheeling\r\nabout in the air, not more than three hundred yards from where I lay.\r\nThis time I took good bearings, and then went on.  I did not care for\r\nthe bird to guide me any longer, for I observed there was an open spot\r\nahead, and I was sure that there I would see something.  And sure enough\r\nI did.  On peeping round the end of a rock, I spied a herd of about\r\nfifty deer.  They were reindeer, of course, as there are no others upon\r\nthe `Barren Grounds,' and I saw they were all does--for at this season\r\nthe bucks keep altogether in the woods.  Some of them were pawing the\r\nsnow to get at the moss, while others were standing by the rocks, and\r\ntearing off the lichens with their teeth.  It so happened that I had the\r\nwind of them, else they would have scented me and made off, for I was\r\nwithin a hundred yards of the nearest.  I was not afraid of their taking\r\nfright, so long as they could only see part of my body--for these deer\r\nare so stupid, or rather so curious, that almost anything will draw them\r\nwithin shot.  Knowing this, I practised a trick that had often helped me\r\nbefore; and that was to move the barrel of my gun, up and down, with the\r\nsame sort of motion as the deer make with their horns, when rubbing\r\ntheir necks against a rock or tree.  If I'd had a set of antlers, it\r\nwould have been all the better; but the other answered well enough.  It\r\nhappened the animals were not very wild, as, likely, they hadn't been\r\nhunted for a good while.  I bellowed at the same time,--for I know how\r\nto imitate their call--and, in less than a minute's time, I got several\r\nof them within range.  Then I took aim, and knocked one over, and the\r\nrest ran off.  That,\" said Norman, \"ended my adventure--unless you call\r\nthe carrying a good hundred pounds weight of deer-meat all the way back\r\nto camp part of it.  If so, I can assure you that it was by far the most\r\nunpleasant part.\"\r\n\r\nHere Norman finished his narration, and a conversation was carried on\r\nupon the subject of reindeer, or, as these animals are termed, in\r\nAmerica, \"caribou.\"\r\n\r\nLucien said that the reindeer (_Cervus tarandus_) is found in the\r\nNorthern regions of Europe and Asia as well as in America, but that\r\nthere were several varieties of them, and perhaps there were different\r\nspecies.  Those of Lapland are most celebrated, because they not only\r\ndraw sledges, but also furnish food, clothing, and many other\r\ncommodities for their owners.  In the north of Asia, the Tungusians have\r\na much larger sort, which they ride upon; and the Koreki, who dwell upon\r\nthe borders of Kamschatka, possess vast herds of reindeer--some rich\r\nindividuals owning as many as ten or twenty thousand!\r\n\r\nIt is not certain that the reindeer of America is exactly the same as\r\neither of the kinds mentioned; and indeed in America itself there are\r\ntwo very distinct kinds--perhaps a third.  Two kinds are well-known,\r\nthat differ from each other in size, and also in habits.  One is the\r\n\"Barren Ground caribou,\" and the other, the \"Woodland caribou.\"  The\r\nformer is one of the smallest of the deer kind--the bucks weighing\r\nlittle over one hundred pounds.  As its name implies, it frequents the\r\nBarren Grounds, although in winter it also seeks the shelter of wooded\r\ntracts.  Upon the Barren Grounds, and the desolate shores and islands of\r\nthe Arctic Sea, it is the only kind of deer found, except at one or two\r\npoints, as the mouth of the Mackenzie River--which happens to be a\r\nwooded country, and there the moose also is met with.  Nature seems to\r\nhave gifted the Barren Ground caribou with such tastes and habits, that\r\na fertile country and a genial clime would not be a pleasant home for\r\nit.  It seems adapted to the bleak, sterile countries in which it\r\ndwells, and where its favourite food--the mosses and lichens--is found.\r\nIn the short summer of the Arctic regions, it ranges still farther\r\nnorth; and its traces have been found wherever the Northern navigators\r\nhave gone.  It must remain among the icy islands of the Arctic Sea until\r\nwinter be considerably advanced, or until the sea is so frozen as to\r\nallow it to get back to the shores of the continent.\r\n\r\nThe \"Woodland caribou\" is a larger variety--a Woodland doe being about\r\nas big as a Barren Ground buck--although the horns of the latter species\r\nare larger and more branching than those of the former.  The Woodland\r\nkind are found around the shores of Hudson's Bay, and in other wooded\r\ntracts that lie in the southern parts of the fur countries--into which\r\nthe Barren Ground caribou never penetrates.  They also migrate annually,\r\nbut, strange to say, their spring migrations are southward, while, at\r\nthe same season, their cousins of the Barren Grounds are making their\r\nway northward to the shores of the Arctic Sea.  This is a very singular\r\ndifference in their habits, and along with their difference in bulk,\r\nform, etcetera, entitles them to be ranked as separate species of deer.\r\nThe flesh of the Woodland caribou is not esteemed so good an article of\r\nfood as that of the other; and, as it inhabits a district where many\r\nlarge animals are found, it is not considered of so much importance in\r\nthe economy of human life.  The \"Barren Ground caribou,\" on the other\r\nhand, is an indispensable animal to various tribes of Indians, as well\r\nas to the Esquimaux.  Without it, these people would be unable to dwell\r\nwhere they do; and although they have not domesticated it, and trained\r\nit to draught, like the Laplanders, it forms their main source of\r\nsubsistence, and there is no part of its body which they do not turn to\r\nsome useful purpose.  Of its horns they form their fish-spears and\r\nhooks, and, previous to the introduction of iron by the Europeans, their\r\nice-chisels and various other utensils.  Their scraping or currying\r\nknives are made from the split shin-bones.  The skins make their\r\nclothing, tent-covers, beds, and blankets.  The raw-hide, cleared of the\r\nhair and cut into thongs, serves for snares, bow-strings, net-lines, and\r\nevery other sort of ropes.  The finer thongs make netting for\r\nsnow-shoes--an indispensable article to these people--and of these\r\nthongs fish-nets are also woven; while the tendons of the muscles, when\r\nsplit, serve for fine sewing-thread.  Besides these uses, the flesh of\r\nthe caribou is the food of many tribes, Indians and Esquimaux, for most\r\nof the year; and, indeed, it may be looked upon as their staple article\r\nof subsistence.  There is hardly any part of it (even the horns, when\r\nsoft) that is not eaten and relished by them.  Were it not for the\r\nimmense herds of these creatures that roam over the country, they would\r\nsoon be exterminated--for they are easily approached, and the Indians\r\nhave very little difficulty, during the summer season, in killing as\r\nmany as they please.\r\n\r\nNorman next gave a description of the various modes of hunting the\r\ncaribou practised by the Indians and Esquimaux; such as driving them\r\ninto a pound, snaring them, decoying and shooting them with arrows, and\r\nalso a singular way which the Esquimaux have of taking them in a\r\npit-trap built in the snow.\r\n\r\n\"The sides of the trap,\" said he, \"are built of slabs of snow, cut as if\r\nto make a snow-house.  An inclined plane of snow leads to the entrance\r\nof the pit, which is about five feet deep, and large enough within to\r\nhold several deer.  The exterior of the trap is banked up on all sides\r\nwith snow; but so steep are these sides left, that the deer can only get\r\nup by the inclined plane which leads to the entrance.  A great slab of\r\nsnow is then placed over the mouth of the pit, and revolves on two axles\r\nof wood.  This slab will carry the deer until it has passed the line of\r\nthe axles, when its weight overbalances one side, and the animal is\r\nprecipitated into the pit.  The slab then comes back into a horizontal\r\nposition as before, and is ready to receive another deer.  The animals\r\nare attracted by moss and lichens placed for them on the opposite side\r\nof the trap--in such a way that they cannot be reached without crossing\r\nthe slab.  In this sort of trap several deer are frequently caught\r\nduring a single day.\"\r\n\r\nNorman knew another mode of hunting practised by the Esquimaux, and\r\nproposed that the party should proceed in search of the herd upon the\r\nfollowing day; when, should they succeed in finding the deer, he would\r\nshow them how the thing was done: and he had no doubt of their being\r\nable to make a good hunt of it.  All agreed to this proposal, as it\r\nwould be of great importance to them to kill a large number of these\r\nanimals.  It is true they had now provision enough to serve for several\r\ndays--but there were perhaps months, not days, to be provided for.  They\r\nbelieved that they could not be far from the wooded countries near the\r\nbanks of the Mackenzie, as some kinds of the animal they had met with\r\nwere only to be found near timber during the winter season.  But what of\r\nthat?  Even on the banks of the great river itself they might not\r\nsucceed in procuring game.  They resolved, therefore, to track the herd\r\nof deer which Norman had seen; and for this purpose they agreed to make\r\na stay of some days at their present camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nA BATTLE WITH WOLVES.\r\n\r\nNext morning they were up by early daybreak.  The days were now only a\r\nfew hours in length, for it was mid-winter, and they were but three or\r\nfour degrees south of the Arctic circle.  Of course they would require\r\nall the day for the intended hunt of the caribou, as they might have to\r\nfollow the track of the herd for many miles before coming up with the\r\nanimals.  Lucien was to remain by the camp, as it would never do to\r\nleave the animals they had already lulled without some guard.  To have\r\nhung them on the trees, would have put them out of the reach of both\r\nwolves and foxes; but the lynx and wolverene are both tree-climbers, and\r\ncould easily have got at them there.  They had reason to believe there\r\nwere wolverenes about; for these fierce and destructive beasts are found\r\nin every part of the fur countries--wherever there exist other animals\r\nupon which they can prey.  Eagles, hawks, and owls, moreover, would have\r\npicked the partridges from the branches of the trees without difficulty.\r\nOne proposed burying them in the snow; but Norman assured them that the\r\nArctic foxes could scent them out, and dig them up in a few minutes.\r\nThen it was suggested to cover them under a pile of stones, as there\r\nwere plenty of these lying about.  To this Norman also objected, saying\r\nthat the wolverene could pull off any stones they were able to pile upon\r\nthem--as this creature in its fore-legs possesses more than the strength\r\nof a man.  Besides, it was not unlikely that one of the great brown\r\nbears,--a species entirely different from either the black or grizzly\r\nbears, and which is only met with on the Barren Grounds--might come\r\nranging that way; and he could soon toss over any stone-heap they might\r\nbuild.  On the whole it was better that one of the four should remain by\r\nthe camp; and Lucien, who cared less about hunting than any of them,\r\nwillingly agreed to be the one.\r\n\r\nTheir arrangements were soon completed, and the three hunters set out.\r\nThey did not go straight towards the place where Norman had found the\r\ndeer upon the preceding day, but took a cross-cut over the hills.  This\r\nwas by Norman's advice, who guided himself by the wind--which had not\r\nchanged since the previous day.  He knew that the caribou in feeding\r\nalways travel _against_ the wind; and he expected therefore to find them\r\nsomewhere in the direction from which it was blowing.  Following a\r\ncourse, which angled with that of the wind, they kept on, expecting soon\r\nto strike the trail of the herd.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lucien, left to himself, was not idle.  He had to prepare the\r\nflesh of the different animals, so as to render it fit to be carried\r\nalong.  Nothing was required farther than to skin and cut them up.\r\nNeither salting nor drying was necessary, for the flesh of one and all\r\nhad got frozen as stiff as a stone, and in this way it would keep during\r\nthe whole winter.  The wolf was skinned with the others, but this was\r\nbecause his fine skin was wanted.  His flesh was not intended to be\r\neaten--although only a day or two before any one of the party would have\r\nbeen glad of such a meal.  Not only the Indians, but the voyageurs and\r\nfur-traders, while journeying through these inhospitable wilds, are\r\noften but too delighted to get a dinner of wolf-meat.  The ermine and\r\nthe little mouse were the only other creatures of the collection that\r\nwere deemed uneatable.  As to the Arctic fox and the lynx, the flesh of\r\nboth these creatures is highly esteemed, and is white and tender, almost\r\nas much so as the hares upon which they feed.  The snowy owl too, the\r\njerfalcon, and the eagle, were looked upon as part of the larder--the\r\nflesh of all being almost as good as that of the grouse.  Had it been a\r\nfishing eagle--such as the bald-head--the case would have been\r\ndifferent, for these last, on account of their peculiar food, taste rank\r\nand disagreeable.  But there was no danger of their falling in with a\r\nfishing eagle at that place.  These can only exist where there is _open_\r\nwater.  Hence the cause of their annual migrations to the southward,\r\nwhen the lakes and rivers of the fur countries become covered with their\r\nwinter ice.\r\n\r\nThough Lucien remained quietly at the camp he was not without adventures\r\nto keep him from wearying.  While he was singeing his grouse his eye\r\nhappened to fall upon the shadow of a bird passing over the snow.  On\r\nlooking up he saw a very large bird, nearly as big as an eagle, flying\r\nsoftly about in wide circles.  It was of a mottled-brown colour; but its\r\nshort neck and great round head told the naturalist at a glance that it\r\nwas a bird of the owl genus.  It was the largest of the kind that Lucien\r\nhad ever seen, and was, in fact, the largest known in America--the\r\n\"great cinereous owl\" (_Strix cinerea_).  Now and then it would alight\r\nupon a rock or tree, at the distance of an hundred yards or so from the\r\ncamp; where it would watch the operations of Lucien, evidently inclined\r\nto help him in dissecting some of the animals.  Whenever he took up his\r\ngun and tried to approach within shot, it would rise into the air again,\r\nalways keeping out of range.  Lucien was provoked at this--for he\r\nwished, as a naturalist, to examine the bird, and for this purpose to\r\nkill it, of course; but the owl seemed determined that he should do no\r\nsuch thing.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, Lucien resolved upon a plan to decoy the creature\r\nwithin shot.  Taking up one of the grouse, he flung it out upon the snow\r\nsome thirty yards from the fire.  No sooner had he done so, than the\r\nowl, at sight of the tempting morsel, left aside both its shyness and\r\nprudence, and sailed gently forward; then, hovering for a moment over\r\nthe ground, hooked the grouse upon its claws, and was about to carry it\r\noff, when a bullet from Lucien's rifle, just in the \"nick of time,\" put\r\na stop to its further flight, and dropped the creature dead upon the\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nLucien picked it up and brought it to the camp, where he passed some\r\ntime in making notes upon its size, colour, and other peculiarities.\r\nThe owl measured exactly two feet in length from the point of the bill\r\nto the end of the tail; and its \"alar spread,\" as naturalists term it,\r\nwas full five feet in extent.  It was of a clove-brown colour,\r\nbeautifully mottled with white, and its bill and eyes were of a bright\r\ngamboge yellow.  Like all of its tribe that winter in the Arctic wilds,\r\nit was feathered to the toes.  Lucien reflected that this species lives\r\nmore in the woods than the \"great snowy owl,\" and, as he had heard, is\r\nnever found far out on the Barren Grounds during winter.  This fact,\r\ntherefore, was a pleasant one to reflect upon, for it confirmed the\r\ntestimony which the travellers had already obtained from several of the\r\nother creatures they had killed--that is to say, that they must be in\r\nthe neighbourhood of some timbered country.\r\n\r\nLucien had hardly finished his examination of the owl when he was called\r\nupon to witness another incident of a much more exciting nature.  A\r\nhill, as already mentioned, or rather a ridge, rose up from the opposite\r\nshore of the lake by which the camp was pitched.  The declivity of this\r\nhill fronted the lake, and sloped gradually back from the edge of the\r\nwater.  Its whole face was smooth and treeless, covered with a layer of\r\npure snow.  The camp commanded a full view of it up to its very crest.\r\n\r\nAs Lucien was sitting quietly by the fire a singular sound, or rather\r\ncontinuation of sounds, fell upon his ear.  It somewhat resembled the\r\nbaying of hounds at a distance; and at first he was inclined to believe\r\nthat it was Marengo on a view-hunt after the deer.  On listening more\r\nattentively, however, he observed that the sounds came from more than\r\none animal; and also, that they bore more resemblance to the howling of\r\nwolves than the deep-toned bay of a bloodhound.  This, in fact, it was;\r\nfor the next moment a caribou shot up over the crest of the hill, and\r\nwas seen stretching at full gallop down the smooth declivity in the\r\ndirection of the lake.  Not twenty paces in its rear followed a string\r\nof howling animals, evidently in pursuit of it.  There were a dozen of\r\nthem in all, and they were running exactly like hounds upon the \"view\r\nholloa.\"  Lucien saw at a glance they were wolves.  Most of them were\r\ndappled-grey and white, while some were of a pure white colour.  Any one\r\nof them was nearly as large as the caribou itself; for in these parts--\r\naround Great Slave Lake--the wolf grows to his largest size.\r\n\r\nThe caribou gained upon them as it bounded down the slope of the hill.\r\nIt was evidently making for the lake, believing, no doubt, that the\r\nblack ice upon its surface was water, and that in that element it would\r\nhave the advantage of its pursuers, for the caribou is a splendid\r\nswimmer.  Nearly all deer when hunted take to the water--to throw off\r\nthe dogs, or escape from men--and to this habit the reindeer makes no\r\nexception.\r\n\r\nDown the hill swept the chase, Lucien having a full view both of\r\npursuers and pursued.  The deer ran boldly.  It seemed to have gathered\r\nfresh confidence at sight of the lake, while the same object caused its\r\npursuers a feeling of disappointment.  They knew they were no match for\r\na caribou in the water, as no doubt many a one had escaped them in that\r\nelement.  It is not likely, however, that they made reflections of this\r\nsort.  There was but little time.  From the moment of their appearance\r\nupon the crest of the hill till the chase arrived at the edge of the\r\nlake, was but a few seconds.  On reaching the shore the caribou made no\r\nstop; but bounded forward in the same way as if it had been springing\r\nupon water.  Most likely it expected to hear a plunge; but, instead of\r\nthat, its hoofs came down upon the hard ice; and, by the impulse thus\r\ngiven, the animal shot out with the velocity of a skater.  Strange to\r\nsay, it still kept its feet; but, now seemingly overcome by surprise,\r\nand knowing the advantage its pursuers would have over it upon the\r\nslippery ice, it began to plunge and flounder, and once or twice came to\r\nits knees.  The hungry pursuers appeared to recognise their advantage at\r\nonce, for their howling opened with a fresh burst, and they quickened\r\ntheir pace.  Their sharp claws enabled them to gallop over the ice at\r\ntop speed; and one large brute that led the pack soon came up with the\r\ndeer, sprang upon it, and bit it in the flank.  This brought the deer\r\nupon its haunches, and at once put an end to the chase.  The animal was\r\nhardly down upon the ice, when the foremost wolves coming up\r\nprecipitated themselves upon its body, and began to devour it.\r\n\r\nIt was about the middle of the lake where the caribou had been\r\novertaken.  At the time it first reached the ice, Lucien had laid hold\r\nof his rifle and run forward in order to meet the animal halfway, and,\r\nif possible, get a shot at it.  Now that the creature was killed, he\r\ncontinued on with the design of driving off the wolves, and securing the\r\ncarcass of the deer for himself.  He kept along the ice until he was\r\nwithin less than twenty yards of the pack, when, seeing that the fierce\r\nbrutes had torn the deer to pieces, and perceiving, moreover, that they\r\nexhibited no fear of himself, he began to think he might be in danger by\r\nadvancing any nearer.  Perhaps a shot from his rifle would scatter them,\r\nand without further reflection he raised the piece, and fired.  One of\r\nthe wolves kicked over upon the ice, and lay quite dead; but the others,\r\nto Lucien's great surprise, instead of being frightened off, immediately\r\nsprang upon their dead companion, and commenced tearing and devouring\r\nit, just as they had done the deer!\r\n\r\nThe sight filled Lucien with alarm; which was increased at seeing\r\nseveral of the wolves--that had been beaten by the others from the\r\nquarry--commence making demonstrations towards himself!  Lucien now\r\ntrembled for his safety, and no wonder.  He was near the middle of the\r\nlake upon slippery ice.  To attempt running back to the camp would be\r\nhazardous; the wolves could overtake him before he had got halfway, and\r\nhe felt certain that any signs of fear on his part would be the signal\r\nfor the fierce brutes to assail him.\r\n\r\nFor some moments he was irresolute how to act.  He had commenced loading\r\nhis gun, but his fingers were numbed with the cold, and it was a good\r\nwhile before he could get the piece ready for a second fire.  He\r\nsucceeded at length.  He did not fire then, but resolved to keep the\r\ncharge for a more desperate crisis.  Could he but reach the camp there\r\nwere trees near it, and one of these he might climb.  This was his only\r\nhope, in case the wolves attacked him, and he knew it was.  Instead of\r\nturning and running for this point, he began to back for it stealthily\r\nand with caution, keeping his front all the while towards the wolves,\r\nand his eyes fixed upon them.  He had not got many yards, when he\r\nperceived to his horror, that the whole pack were in motion, and _coming\r\nafter him_!  It was a terrible sight, and Lucien, seeing that by\r\nretreating he only drew them on, stopped and held his rifle in a\r\nthreatening attitude.  The wolves were now within twenty yards of him;\r\nbut, instead of moving any longer directly towards him, they broke into\r\ntwo lines, swept past on opposite sides of him, and then circling round,\r\nmet each other in his rear.  _His retreat was cut off_!\r\n\r\nHe now stood upon the ice with the fierce wolves forming a ring around\r\nhim, whose diameter was not the six lengths of his gun, and _every_\r\nmoment growing shorter and shorter.  The prospect was appalling.  It\r\nwould have caused the stoutest heart to quail, and Lucien's was\r\nterrified.  He shouted at the top of his voice.  He fired his rifle at\r\nthe nearest.  The brute fell, but the others showed no symptoms of fear;\r\nthey only grew more furious.  Lucien clubbed his gun--the last resort in\r\nsuch cases--and laid around him with all his might; but he was in danger\r\nof slipping upon the ice, and his efforts were feeble.  Once down he\r\nnever would have risen again, for his fierce assailants would have\r\nsprung upon him like tigers.  As it was, he felt but little hope.  He\r\nbelieved himself lost.  The teeth of the ferocious monsters gleamed\r\nunder his eyes.  He was growing weaker and weaker, yet still he battled\r\non, and swept his gun around him with the energy of despair.  Such a\r\nstruggle could not have continued much longer.  Lucien's fate would have\r\nbeen sealed in a very few minutes more, had not relief arrived in some\r\nshape or other.  But it did come.  A loud shout was heard upon the hill;\r\nand Lucien, glancing suddenly towards it, saw several forms rushing\r\ndownward to the lake!  It was the hunting party returned, and in a\r\nmoment more they were crossing the ice to his rescue.  Lucien gaining\r\nconfidence fought with fresh vigour.  The wolves busy in their attack\r\nhad either not heard or were regardless of the new-comers; but the\r\n\"crack, crack\" of the guns--repeated no less than four times--and then\r\nthe nearer reports of pistols, made a speedy impression upon the brutes,\r\nand in a short while half their number were seen tumbling and kicking\r\nupon the ice.  The rest, uttering their hideous howls, took to flight,\r\nand soon disappeared from the valley; and Lucien, half dead with\r\nfatigue, staggered into the arms of his deliverers.\r\n\r\nNo less than seven of the wolves were killed in the affray--two of which\r\nLucien had shot himself.  One or two were only wounded, but so badly,\r\nthat they could not get away; and these were handed over to the tender\r\nmercies of Marengo, who amused himself for some time after by worrying\r\nthem to death.\r\n\r\nThe hunting party had made a good day of it.  They had fallen in with\r\nthe caribou, and had killed three of them.  These they were bringing to\r\ncamp, but had dropped them upon the hill, on perceiving the perilous\r\nposition of Lucien.  They now went back, and having carried the deer to\r\ntheir camping-place, were soon engaged in the pleasant occupation of\r\neating a savoury dinner.  Lucien soon recovered from his fright and\r\nfatigue, and amused his companions by giving an account of the\r\nadventures that had befallen him in their absence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY NINE.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE \"VOYAGE.\"\r\n\r\nOur party remained several days at this place, until they had made a\r\nfresh stock of \"pemmican\" from the flesh of the caribou, several more of\r\nwhich they succeeded in killing; and then, arranging everything anew,\r\nand taking with them such skins as they wanted, they continued their\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThey had two days' hard travelling through a rocky mountainous country,\r\nwhere they could not find a stick of wood to cook their meals with, and\r\nwere exposed to cold more than at any other place.  Both Francois and\r\nLucien had their faces frost-bitten; but they were cured by Norman, who\r\nprevented them from going near a fire until he had well rubbed the parts\r\nwith soft snow.\r\n\r\nThe rocks through which they passed were in many places covered with the\r\n_tripe de roche (Gyrophora_) of several species; but our voyageurs cared\r\nnothing about it so long as their pemmican lasted, and of that each of\r\nthem had nearly as much as he could carry.\r\n\r\nIn the most dreary part of the mountains they chanced upon a herd of\r\nthose curious animals, the musk-oxen, and shot one of them; but the meat\r\ntasted so rank, and smelt so strongly of musk, that the whole of it was\r\nleft to the wolves, foxes, and other preying creatures of these parts.\r\n\r\nOn the third day, after leaving their camp by the lake, a pleasant\r\nprospect opened before them.  It was the valley of the Mackenzie,\r\nstretching to the west, and extending north and south as far as the eye\r\ncould reach, covered with forests of pine and poplar, and other large\r\ntrees.  Of course the landscape was a winter one, as the river was bound\r\nup in ice, and the trees themselves were half-white with frozen snow;\r\nbut after the dreary scenery of the Barren Grounds, even this appeared\r\nwarm and summer-like.  There was no longer any danger they should be\r\nwithout a good fire to cook their dinners, or warm themselves at, and a\r\nwooded country offers a better prospect of game.  The sight, therefore,\r\nof a great forest was cheering; and our travellers, in high spirits,\r\nplanted their tent upon the banks of the great Northern river.  They had\r\nstill many hundred miles to go before arriving at their destination; but\r\nthey determined to continue their journey without much delay, following\r\nthe river as a guide.  No more \"near cuts\" were to be taken in future.\r\nThey had learned, from their recent experience, that \"the shortest way\r\nacross is sometimes the longest way round,\" and they resolved to profit\r\nby the lesson.  I hope, boy reader, you too will remember it.\r\n\r\nAfter reaching the Mackenzie the voyageurs halted one day, and upon the\r\nnext commenced their journey down-stream.  Sometimes they kept upon the\r\nbank, but at times, for a change, they travelled upon the ice of the\r\nriver.  There was no danger of its giving way under them, for it was\r\nmore than a foot in thickness, and would have supported a loaded waggon\r\nand horses, without even cracking.\r\n\r\nThey were now drawing near the Arctic circle, and the days grew shorter\r\nand shorter as they advanced.  But this did not much interfere with\r\ntheir travelling.  The long nights of the Polar regions are not like\r\nthose of more Southern latitudes.  They are sometimes so clear, that one\r\nmay read the smallest print.  What with the coruscations of the aurora\r\nborealis, and the cheerful gleaming of the Northern constellations, one\r\nmay travel without difficulty throughout the livelong night.  I am sure,\r\nmy young friend, you have made good use of your globes, and need not be\r\ntold that the length of both nights and days, as you approach the pole,\r\ndepends upon two things--the latitude of the place, and the season of\r\nthe year; and were you to spend a whole year _leaning against the pole\r\nitself_, (!) you would _live but one day and one night_--each of them\r\nsix months in length.\r\n\r\nBut no doubt you know all these things without my telling you of them,\r\nand you are impatient to hear not about that, but whether the young\r\nvoyageurs safely reached the end of their journey.  That question I\r\nanswer briefly at once--they did.\r\n\r\nSome distance below the point where they had struck the Mackenzie, they\r\nfell in with a winter encampment of Dog-rib Indians.  Some of these\r\npeople had been to the Fort to trade; and Norman being known to them, he\r\nand his Southern cousins were received with much hospitality.  All their\r\nwants were provided for, as far as it lay in the power of these poor\r\npeople to do; but the most valuable thing obtained from the Indians was\r\na full set of dogs and dog-sledges for the whole party.  These were\r\nfurnished by the chief, upon the understanding that he should be paid\r\nfor them on his next visit to the Fort.  Although the reindeer of North\r\nAmerica are not trained to the sledge by the Esquimaux and Indians,\r\nseveral kinds of dogs are; and a single pair of these faithful creatures\r\nwill draw a full-grown man at a rate that exceeds almost every other\r\nmode of travelling--steam excepted.  When our voyageurs, therefore,\r\nflung away their snow-shoes, and, wrapped in their skin cloaks, seated\r\nthemselves snugly in their dog-sledges, the five hundred miles that\r\nseparated them from the Fort were soon reduced to nothing; and one\r\nafternoon, four small sledges, each carrying a \"young voyageur,\" with a\r\nlarge bloodhound galloping in the rear, were seen driving up to the\r\nstockade fence surrounding the Fort.  Before they had quite reached the\r\ngate, there was a general rush of trappers, traders, voyageurs,\r\n_coureurs-des-bois_, and other _employes_, to reach them; and the next\r\nmoment they were lost in the midst of the people who crowded out of the\r\nFort to welcome them.  This was their hour of happiness and joy.\r\n\r\nTo me there is an hour of regret, and I hope, boy reader, to you as\r\nwell--the hour of our parting with the \"Young _Voyageurs_.\"\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
