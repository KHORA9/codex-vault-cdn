Published July, 1911\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nBY THE GENERAL EDITOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the day of the small book. There is much to be done. Time is\r\nshort. Information is earnestly desired, but it is wanted in compact\r\nform, confined directly to the subject in view, authenticated by real\r\nknowledge, and, withal, gracefully delivered. It is to fulfill these\r\nconditions that the present series has been projected--to lend real\r\nassistance to those who are looking about for new tools and fresh ideas.\r\n\r\nIt is addressed especially to the man and woman at a distance from the\r\nlibraries, exhibitions, and daily notes of progress, which are the main\r\nadvantage, to a studious mind, of living in or near a large city. The\r\neditor has had in view, especially, the farmer and villager who is\r\nstriving to make the life of himself and his family broader and brighter,\r\nas well as to increase his bank account; and it is therefore in the\r\nhumane, rather than in a commercial direction, that the Library has been\r\nplanned.\r\n\r\nThe average American little needs advice on the conduct of his farm or\r\nbusiness; or, if he thinks he does, a large supply of such help in\r\nfarming and trading as books and periodicals can give, is available to\r\nhim. But many a man who is well to do and knows how to continue to make\r\nmoney, is ignorant how to spend it in a way to bring to himself, and\r\nconfer upon his wife and children, those conveniences, comforts and\r\nniceties which alone make money worth acquiring and life worth living. He\r\nhardly realizes that they are within his reach.\r\n\r\nFor suggestion and guidance in this direction there is a real call, to\r\nwhich this series is an answer. It proposes to tell its readers how they\r\ncan make work easier, health more secure, and the home more enjoyable and\r\ntenacious of the whole family. No evil in American rural life is so great\r\nas the tendency of the young people to leave the farm and the village.\r\nThe only way to overcome this evil is to make rural life less hard and\r\nsordid; more comfortable and attractive. It is to the solving of that\r\nproblem that these books are addressed. Their central idea is to show how\r\ncountry life may be made richer in interest, broader in its activities\r\nand its outlook, and sweeter to the taste.\r\n\r\nTo this end men and women who have given each a lifetime of study and\r\nthought to his or her specialty, will contribute to the Library, and it\r\nis safe to promise that each volume will join with its eminently\r\npractical information a still more valuable stimulation of thought.\r\n\r\nERNEST INGERSOLL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  TABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                          PAGE\r\n\r\n     I IMPORTANCE OF OUR SUBJECT                      3\r\n    II CARE OF THE PERSON                            12\r\n   III SANITATION IN AND ABOUT THE HOUSE             35\r\n    IV HYGIENE OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD              63\r\n     V PROPER EATING--THE SECRET OF GOOD HEALTH      92\r\n    VI BREAD AND ITS RELATIONS                      104\r\n   VII MEATS, SUGARS AND MILK                       117\r\n  VIII FOOD-VALUE OF VEGETABLES                     130\r\n    IX DANGER IN FRUITS AND PICKLES                 144\r\n     X DRINKS--PROPER AND HARMFUL                   148\r\n    XI IMPORTANCE OF GOOD COOKING                   164\r\n   XII SEVEN AVOIDABLE DISEASES                     171\r\n  XIII HYGIENE OF THE SICK ROOM                     217\r\n   XIV EMERGENCIES AND ACCIDENTS                    223\r\n    XV WHAT TO DO WHEN POISONED                     251\r\n       APPENDIX                                     273\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEALTH ON THE FARM\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF OUR SUBJECT\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the extraordinary advances in a material way that have\r\nbeen accomplished in this country within the last few decades, it is a\r\nsignificant and most alarming fact that progress in hygienic matters has\r\nlagged far behind. Why this is, it would be very difficult to say,--for\r\nthe reason that the causes are perhaps many. Chief among these, probably,\r\nis the fact that our progress along industrial lines has occupied the\r\nentire time of the majority of our best intellects, and it is also in no\r\nsmall degree the consequence of a fatalism that regards disease as a\r\ndirect visitation of providence and therefore a thing which man may not\r\navoid. Another cause in some instances is the pride of our people in\r\ntheir homes and respective localities, which causes them to repel with\r\nindignation the suggestion that any special measures are necessary in\r\norder to conserve the public health where they reside. Ignorant as the\r\naverage man is of the causes that produce sickness and the means by which\r\nthis result is accomplished, he is naturally not in a position to form a\r\ncorrect judgment concerning such matters, and as a consequence, sees no\r\nreasons for taking the precautions that are necessary in order to ward\r\noff disease. This ignorance, it must be confessed with sorrow, is in a\r\nmeasure the fault of the medical profession, which has not in the vast\r\nmajority of instances lived up to its ideals in this connection. Petty\r\nand unworthy rivalry has played an extremely important part in this\r\nfailure of medical men to do their duty in this particular--none of the\r\nphysicians of a community being, as a rule, willing that others should\r\ninstruct the public, however vital this might be for the general good. As\r\na consequence, that class of vultures known as medical quacks has\r\nfurnished to the laity by far the greater proportion of their\r\ninstruction on hygienic subjects, with the result that the average man\r\nhas a greater misconception and less real knowledge of such matters than\r\nof anything else in which he is vitally interested.\r\n\r\nAnother, and very curious explanation for our general disregard of the\r\nlaws of health is that our strong belief in ourselves impels us to think\r\nthat however much others may suffer from things generally regarded as\r\nunhygienic, we, ourselves, will be immune. This belief is fostered by the\r\nfact that in early life there often seems no end to our capacity to\r\nendure, and we find ourselves constantly defying without apparent harm,\r\nwhat we are told by others is directly contrary to all rules of proper\r\nliving. But it is unfortunately true also that the reserve force and\r\ngreat power of resistance that enables us to do these things begins to\r\nwane towards the end of the third decade of life, and we, therefore, find\r\nourselves sooner or later breaking down after we have become thoroughly\r\nconvinced that we were made of iron, and that while other people might\r\nnot be able to do as we were, it could not possibly result in evil in our\r\nown cases.\r\n\r\nWhat a pity it is that the young will not learn from the experience of\r\nthose who have gone before them! Could they only do so, how much\r\nsuffering and woe could be avoided in this world. Unfortunately, however,\r\nthere are few men so constituted that they are willing to be guided by\r\nthe experience of those who have preceded them, and there is but a faint\r\npossibility, therefore, that any good can be accomplished by warning the\r\ncoming generation of the troubles in store for them should they not heed\r\nthe advice of those who have suffered before them. Notwithstanding this,\r\nthe writer feels that these words of warning should be spoken to the\r\nyoung, since they, alas, are the only ones to be benefited by such\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\n_As you value your happiness materially, and as you desire a healthy old\r\nage and a long life, inform yourselves as to the few simple laws that\r\ngovern human existence, and attempt so far as lies in your power to\r\nfollow them. If you do not do this, disaster will follow as surely as the\r\nnight follows the day._\r\n\r\n_Apathy of the Public as to Hygiene._--As a partial consequence,\r\nprobably, of all the reasons mentioned, along with others, there exists\r\nin the popular mind a curious apathy concerning hygienic matters--an\r\napathy so great that it is scarcely possible to get the average man to\r\ndiscuss, much less to put in practice the all-important laws that govern\r\nhealth. As a result of the work of the various State boards of health and\r\nof the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service, this condition of\r\naffairs happily shows some signs of abatement, and we certainly have\r\nreasons to believe that the future promises great things along these\r\nlines. No sign of this change is more significant than the awakening of\r\nthe press of the country to the vast importance of instructing the public\r\nin health matters, and their changed attitude toward the charlatans and\r\nquacks who live by promising the impossible. Largely subsidized by the\r\ninfamous vendors of patent medicine, our newspapers and magazines still\r\nlend their columns to these human vampires who prey pre-eminently on the\r\nignorance and credulity of the hopelessly-diseased poor; but within\r\nrecent years some of our foremost journals show signs of an awakening of\r\nconscience, and a very few have even gone so far as to exclude\r\nadvertisements of this character altogether.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, certainly with more or less truth, that we are\r\ncreatures of our surroundings, but whether we accept this in its broadest\r\nsense or not, there can be no question that our well being is most\r\nintimately connected with those things with which we come into every day\r\ncontact. _Nothing is more important for us to recognize than that our\r\ndiseases are contracted from neighboring subjects just in proportion as\r\nwe are closely associated with them._ From our fellowmen we contract, as\r\neveryone knows, a large number of diseases, either by direct contact or\r\nby means of the air that surrounds us. From the earth we get hook-worms\r\nand other animal parasites, either by coming directly in contact with it\r\nor through eating uncooked fruits and vegetables. From water we get\r\ntyphoid fever, dysentery, cholera, and many other parasitic diseases.\r\nFrom our food we likewise contract dangerous maladies such as tapeworms\r\nfrom uncooked meats and fish and the deadly trichina from raw hog meat.\r\nWith decomposed breads we take the poisons that produce pellagra,\r\nkak-ke, ergotism and acrodinia. From uncooked fruits and vegetables we\r\nget dysentery, typhoid fever, cholera, and parasitic diseases. Spoiled\r\nbeans give us the deadly lathyrismus. From decomposed meat and fish we\r\nget ptomaine poisoning. Mosquitoes convey to us malaria, yellow fever and\r\na parasite known as the filaria. The dreaded sleeping-sickness of Africa\r\ncomes through the bites of a small fly; the bedbug is believed to be the\r\nmeans of conveying a frightful disease known as kala-azar, and the\r\nhouse-fly often brings to us the germs that produce typhoid fever,\r\ndysentery, and probably other diseases as well.\r\n\r\nThe bubonic plague, which is one of the most frightful diseases known, is\r\nconveyed to man by the rat and mouse.[1] Hydrophobia is usually\r\ncontracted from the bite of the dog, and it is a well-known fact that\r\nthis animal often harbors a minute tapeworm, a single egg of which, when\r\nswallowed by the human being, is often followed by death. Both dogs and\r\ncats probably convey diphtheria, and both unquestionably often have\r\nwithin their intestinal tracts tapeworms that occasionally infect\r\nchildren. With the exception of the rare disease known as glanders, the\r\nhorse is not believed to be directly responsible for any of the maladies\r\nfrom which the human being suffers, but it is well established that fully\r\n95 per cent. of house-flies hatch in the manure of these animals, and\r\nthey, therefore, become indirectly responsible for some of the most\r\nserious diseases affecting the human being. It is thus seen that almost\r\nevery object with which man comes in intimate contact is capable of\r\nconveying to him the poison of one or more diseases. If it were possible\r\nfor us to separate ourselves completely from everything with which we are\r\nordinarily associated there can be no question that the span of human\r\nlife would be greatly increased, and that death from bacterial and\r\nparasitic diseases generally would no longer occur. All this is said not\r\nwith the object of startling the reader, but to warn him of the dangers\r\nthat surround him on every hand, and to urge a recognition of that which\r\ncan so materially prolong his life. Fortunately these sources of\r\ninfection may be almost entirely done away with by a few simple rules of\r\nlife, and the health and longevity of mankind must necessarily be\r\ndirectly proportionate to the care with which we observe them.\r\n\r\nIt is now in order to discuss in detail the subject of personal hygiene.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] See the volume in this Library, _Animal Competitors_, by ERNEST\r\nINGERSOLL, for the agency of rats and mice in the introduction and\r\ndissemination of plague and other diseases; and the means of destroying\r\nthese pests of the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCARE OF THE PERSON\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is happily the case that in America the importance of personal\r\ncleanliness is more thoroughly understood, and is more generally\r\npracticed than any of the other important hygienic procedures. While it\r\nis true that there are many--particularly those of foreign extraction,\r\nand who live for the most part in the larger cities--to whom an\r\noccasional bath appeals only as a painful necessity, a very large\r\npercentage of those born in this country bathe regularly. It should be\r\nthoroughly understood that a daily bath is essential, not only from the\r\nstandpoint of cleanliness, but from the fact that this practice is in the\r\nhighest degree conducive to health. It should never be forgotten that by\r\ncleanliness infectious materials are removed from the surface of the\r\nbody, and at the same time the skin is put into a condition to eliminate\r\nfrom the system those waste products which it is its special function to\r\nremove. The close relationship of the proper activity of the skin to\r\nhealth is perhaps not generally sufficiently appreciated--for it is true\r\nthat the body cannot remain normal when the secretory power of its glands\r\nis impaired, and that even death quickly follows when they cease to\r\nfunctionate altogether.\r\n\r\n_Advice as to Bathing._--Much difference of opinion exists as to the\r\nproper temperature of the water for bathing, some holding that it should\r\nbe quite cold, while others are equally positive that it should be warm.\r\nUnfortunately it is impossible to give fixed rules concerning this\r\nsomewhat important matter, for there is every reason to believe that it\r\nshould be determined in each individual case according to circumstances,\r\nand that, therefore, both may be right. Some persons unquestionably do\r\nbetter with one, and some with the other. It has been established clearly\r\nthat the cold bath is highly stimulating, and where not too prolonged,\r\nand when followed by vigorous rubbing, is undoubtedly healthful for a\r\nlarge number of people. The cold bath is often used by physicians in the\r\ntreatment of diseases of low vitality. Many persons however, are\r\nunpleasantly affected by bathing in water of a temperature much below\r\nthat of the body; particularly is this true of women, and the like may be\r\nsaid of thin and nervous persons of the other sex. It is claimed by the\r\nadvocates of the cold bath that those who practice this procedure daily\r\nare practically immune from colds, but this, certainly, is not always\r\ntrue; on the contrary the writer has seen instances where the cold bath\r\nhas unquestionably led to chronic nasal catarrh, with increased tendency\r\nto inflammatory conditions of the air passages. It is also the case that\r\nbaths of this description tend in some persons to prevent a normal\r\naccumulation of fat beneath the skin, and keep individuals of this kind\r\nunnaturally lean.\r\n\r\nThe warm bath is perhaps, on the whole, more popular than the cold, since\r\nit is preferred usually by children and women, and is practiced by a\r\nconsiderable proportion of adult males. It is unquestionably somewhat\r\nenervating, and at best fails entirely to give the agreeable stimulation\r\nexperienced by those who take a cold plunge. It is, however, to be\r\npreferred in those instances where cold water produces disagreeable\r\neffects, and if the bath be not too long continued it is followed by no\r\nill results. Persons who become lean under cold baths not uncommonly take\r\non flesh when they begin to use warm ones. It is unquestionably true that\r\nthe latter is to be preferred in hot climates.\r\n\r\nThe sea bath is invigorating not only from the water being cool, but as a\r\nconsequence of the pleasurable excitement with which it is attended. Its\r\ngreatest disadvantage lies in the fact that there is a tendency to overdo\r\nit, many persons remaining in the water for hours. Ten or fifteen minutes\r\nis as long as the average person should indulge in sea-bathing, and it is\r\na question if even those who are young and vigorous should remain in the\r\nwater longer than half an hour.\r\n\r\nBathing of any kind should be indulged in before meals, the best time\r\nbeing before breakfast in the morning.\r\n\r\n_Care of the Teeth._--Nothing in connection with the subject of personal\r\nhygiene is of more importance than keeping the teeth properly cleansed.\r\nThe fact is not generally appreciated that sound teeth stand in a most\r\nintimate relationship with good health, and that disastrous consequences\r\nare sure to follow sooner or later where these most important structures\r\nare neglected.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that in a person of vigorous health one or two decayed\r\nteeth do not, as a rule, occasion obvious trouble at once, ill effects\r\nare sure sooner or later to be felt. For one thing, a person without good\r\nteeth cannot chew his food well. Those who begin by neglecting what at\r\nfirst are slight defects in the teeth seem to acquire in the course of\r\ntime a sort of habit of doing this, and ultimately disregard and fail to\r\nhave corrected the more serious diseases of the dental structures.\r\nNothing is more common than for the practicing physician to find patients\r\nwith one or more teeth partially gone, or, even worse, with only the\r\nexposed roots remaining.\r\n\r\nWhere cavities exist, food is constantly forced into them, and undergoing\r\ndecomposition, the breath of their owner becomes foul, and portions of\r\ndecayed food mixed with multitudes of bacteria are constantly swallowed;\r\nsooner or later there inevitably follows under such circumstances\r\ncatarrhal conditions of the stomach, which reaches a point in some\r\nindividuals where the health is seriously threatened. Not only do bad\r\nteeth produce trouble in the way just mentioned, but there is every\r\nreason to believe that germs that produce disease--particularly those\r\nthat cause consumption--not uncommonly find their way to the interior of\r\nthe body through the resulting cavities.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of everyone to properly cleanse the teeth at least once\r\ndaily--to do so after each meal would be even still better. This should\r\nbe done with a moderately soft brush, with which it is unnecessary to use\r\ntooth-powders or lotions--though many prefer to do so. Where something of\r\nthe kind is desired, ordinary lime-water is perhaps as satisfactory as\r\nanything else; peroxide of hydrogen, diluted eight or ten times with\r\nwater, to which a pinch or two of ordinary cooking soda has been added,\r\nundoubtedly aids the cleansing process, and has the advantage that it\r\nleaves a pleasant after-taste in the mouth. In brushing the teeth care\r\nshould be taken that every part of the tooth receives attention, it being\r\nnot sufficient, as is so often done, merely to brush the front. It should\r\nbe the practice of everyone to have the teeth looked over at least once a\r\nyear by a good dentist, as even where cleansing is diligently performed\r\ndecay frequently sets in on their inner sides.\r\n\r\nThe utmost care should be taken of the permanent teeth especially, and as\r\nlong as it is possible to prevent it no one should be allowed to pull\r\nthem. There can be no doubt that life is shortened by the early loss of\r\nthe permanent teeth in most, if not in all, cases--not to count loss in\r\nhealth and happiness that follows their absence.\r\n\r\n_Clothing,--Material and Color._--Clothing will be considered in this\r\narticle only as regards its function of properly protecting the body,\r\nwhich it does by preventing the escape of heat, thus keeping the body\r\nwarm, or, under other circumstances, by keeping out excessive heat or\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nMaterials of which clothing is made differ very greatly in their ability\r\nto accomplish the object just mentioned, some being comparatively poor\r\nconductors of heat and hence fulfill the desired function admirably,\r\nwhile others, for opposite reasons, are of comparatively little value for\r\nthis purpose. In general it may be said that structures of animal origin,\r\nsuch as wool and silk, are much poorer heat conductors than those\r\nobtained from the vegetable world, and as a consequence the former are\r\njustly held in much higher esteem as material for clothing than the\r\nlatter. It should not be forgotten, however, that the protective value of\r\na fabric also depends upon the manner in which it is woven, since those\r\nthat are loosely constructed are much warmer, other things being equal,\r\nthan those that are put together more closely; this depends upon the fact\r\nthat in the former there are innumerable small cavities between the\r\nfibers in which air is contained, and as this substance is a very poor\r\nconductor of heat, it follows that a garment made loosely and containing\r\nmany such chambers is warmer than where the number is less. It may well\r\nbe the case that a fabric constructed of a material which is a poor\r\nconductor of heat and closely woven may be actually cooler than another\r\ncomposed of a substance which is a much better conductor of heat but of a\r\nloose texture.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of different materials of which clothing is made also\r\ndepends upon their capacity to absorb water. This may be done in two\r\nways: the water may simply collect between the fibers, in which case it\r\nmay be in a large measure removed by wringing, or it may be actually\r\nabsorbed into the substance composing the fabric, and, as a consequence,\r\nthe latter, even though containing much moisture, do not appear damp.\r\nFabrics made from vegetable materials, as cotton or linen, have little\r\npower of actually absorbing water, and hence they become wet on the\r\nslightest addition of moisture, while on the other hand those of animal\r\norigin have the capacity of absorbing water, and appear dry even after\r\nthe addition of this substance in considerable amounts. A person,\r\ntherefore, dressed in cotton fabrics will find after active perspiration\r\nhas begun that his clothing quickly becomes moist, while if he have on\r\nwoolen garments this will not occur. It is particularly noteworthy that\r\nwater is gradually removed by evaporation from animal fabrics, which\r\ncauses a general cooling without producing a chill; it is therefore\r\nreadily understood that woolen clothing is much to be preferred where\r\nactive exercise is being taken.\r\n\r\nColor is also of some importance in determining the value of a fabric for\r\nprotecting the body from the sun's heat. Within recent times we have\r\nlearned a great deal respecting the wonderful penetrating power of the\r\ninvisible light rays, and we have every reason to believe that these\r\nmodify to a very considerable degree every process going on within the\r\nbody. The violet and ultra-violet rays are those that unquestionably\r\nexert most influence, and it has been suggested that they may be broken\r\nup and rendered innocuous by covering the body with materials having a\r\nreddish-yellow color. It is not necessary to put these materials on the\r\noutside where they would be conspicuous, but they may be used as lining\r\nfor hats and clothing; and there are good reasons to believe that if\r\ntheir use were generally adopted suffering and actual loss of life from\r\noverheating would be greatly reduced, particularly in warm countries.\r\n\r\n_Work and Rest._--Very slowly the people of our country are beginning to\r\nrealize that it is quite as necessary to rest as to work, though\r\nunfortunately in some quarters a strenuous life is urged as being only\r\nsecondary in importance to possessing a big family; that there is an\r\nintimate association between the two there can be no doubt, since the\r\nlatter beyond peradventure would entail the former. It has ever been the\r\nhabit and misfortune of sages now and then to desert the field of their\r\nown peculiar activities and to make incursions into unknown\r\nregions--generally giving advice with a dogmatism and finality\r\nproportionate to their ignorance of the subject under discussion.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the average American works entirely too much, and\r\nwhile he sometimes accumulates an immense fortune with astounding\r\nrapidity, to his sorrow he often learns later that he has likewise\r\nacquired a damaged heart, premature thickening of his blood-vessels or\r\nnervous dyspepsia with all of its attendant evils. Descended as we are in\r\na large measure from the most vigorous and adventurous Europeans of the\r\nlast few centuries, and coming into possession of a new world where\r\neverything was to be done, this tendency to overwork is most\r\nnatural,--and for this reason is all the more to be combated. That we\r\nhave been able so successfully to carry the burden for several\r\ngenerations is indeed remarkable, but there are not wanting numerous\r\nindications that the strain is beginning to tell. If we do not call a\r\nhalt, and devote more time to rest and agreeable pastimes, disastrous\r\nconsequences are sure to follow, and we will become in the course of time\r\na race of neurasthenics and degenerates. Attention should likewise be\r\ndirected to the fact that men do not develop to the highest point of\r\nmentality who devote their entire time to work, as leisure is absolutely\r\nessential for thought and the development of all that is best in man.\r\n\r\nLet us then cast aside the shallow and ignorant preachments of those who\r\ndo not understand the subject, and devote a reasonable time to the\r\nreading of good books, to thought, to the cultivation of the arts and\r\nsciences, and to pleasurable pastimes. In these particulars we are far\r\nbehind Europe, and we shall never take our place as an intellectual\r\npeople until we radically change our method of life. A nation must dream\r\nbefore becoming great. Let it not be understood from the foregoing that\r\nthe writer would in the slightest degree minimize the necessity for a\r\nreasonable amount of work, for he thoroughly appreciates that without\r\nlabor neither the individual nor the nation itself could remain sound--it\r\nis only urged that excessive work is quite as much to be feared as none\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n_Health and Labor._--As to the number of hours that should be devoted to\r\nlabor no rule can be laid down. It all depends on the age, physical and\r\nmental vigor of the individual, and likewise, to a considerable degree,\r\non the character of the work. Occupations requiring intense mental or\r\nphysical strain can only be kept up for short periods of continuous\r\napplication, while, on the other hand, quite naturally, those of a less\r\nstrenuous nature would permit longer hours. The young man, in pride of\r\nperfect bodily and mental vigor, too often assumes, because he has been\r\nable in the past to do pretty much anything that pleased him without\r\nill-effect, that he can continue to do the same through life. No greater\r\nmistake could be made.\r\n\r\nAnything that has a tendency to undermine the health, repeated\r\nsufficiently often, will ultimately cause a complete breakdown. How often\r\ndo we see the strength and beauty of early manhood blighted and turned to\r\npremature old age and death as a consequence of disregarding the warnings\r\nthat have just been given! How frequently do we observe young men\r\nrejoicing in the emancipation from home and school and spurred on by the\r\nfatal delusion that while others might suffer they will not, becoming in\r\nthe end the victim of that arch enemy of early manhood, consumption!\r\nEvery practicing doctor has seen this, not once, but hundreds of times,\r\nand in the vast majority of instances he can say with truth that the\r\nfrightful result is a consequence of overwork--too often associated with\r\nnocturnal dissipation. The man who works during the day, and devotes his\r\nnights to alcohol and gay company when he should be sleeping, will\r\nassuredly, sooner or later--and usually sooner--suffer the inevitable\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nTo those who live sedentary lives, active out-door exercise is very\r\nessential, but inasmuch as this little volume is being written for those\r\nwho live a saner and more healthful existence, it is not deemed necessary\r\nto discuss here this phase of the subject.\r\n\r\n_Value of Sleep._--Closely connected with the subject just discussed is\r\nsleep. Here also we have no rules, or laws, from which we can clearly\r\ndetermine the amount required in individual cases. Overwise philosophers\r\nhave asserted that seven hours for a man, eight hours for a woman, and\r\nnine hours for a fool, was the allotted time for sleep. As a matter of\r\nfact, the necessity for repose varies greatly in different individuals,\r\nsome of them requiring less while others demand more. It is a safe rule\r\nto follow that every man should sleep as long as he naturally desires,\r\nfor nature is a much better mentor than any man could be--however\r\nlearned. The majority of men require at least eight hours of sleep for\r\nthe day and night, and this should be secured if possible at such a time\r\nas will permit it to be undisturbed; hence it is that man usually prefers\r\nto sleep at night, and, all things considered, it is probably the time\r\nbest suited for his repose. We read many marvelous stories of certain\r\ngreat men who required little or no sleep. Within recent years the press\r\nhas frequently contained articles recounting the extraordinary fact that\r\na certain prominent inventor of this country lived daily on a mere\r\nspoonful or so of food, and only slept a few hours now and then when\r\nthere was nothing else particularly to do. Such stories should be\r\naccepted only on absolute proof, as, irrespective of their utter\r\nimprobability, one may observe that they are generally insisted upon in\r\nand out of season with a pertinacity that would indicate that they were\r\nconceived and are scattered abroad with the sole idea of impressing the\r\ngeneral public with what a marvelous and unusual person the individual in\r\nquestion is. There can be no reasonable doubt that they are merely\r\nevidences of childish vanity and puerile mendacity, and are only referred\r\nto here for the reason that young persons, ignorant of the laws of\r\nhealth, might attempt to emulate them, with results that could be but\r\ndisastrous. _Nothing so preserves youth, health, and good looks as a\r\nsufficient amount of sleep, and it is pre-eminently the secret of long\r\nlife._\r\n\r\nReference will be made in the chapter on the Hygiene of Infancy to the\r\nnecessity of children sleeping as much as is possible. It will do no harm\r\nto say again here that nothing is so essential for the proper development\r\nof the body as sleep, _and that it is absolutely a crime to awaken a\r\nchild except under circumstances of absolute necessity._\r\n\r\n_Precautions in Respect to Eating._--A sufficient amount of sleep, and a\r\nproper quantity of digestible and nutritious food, thoroughly cooked and\r\ncarefully masticated, are the things which above all others are most\r\nimportant for the maintenance of health. In the chapter on Foods, the\r\nnutritive values and digestibility of the various articles eaten by man\r\nwill be discussed with sufficient thoroughness to instruct the reader as\r\nto a wholesome dietary; it is, therefore, not necessary here to go into\r\nthe matter fully, but the subject is so important that a few general\r\nremarks will not be out of place.\r\n\r\nEating should never, so far as is possible, be hurried. Nothing is more\r\nimportant for the proper digestion of food than its thorough\r\nmastication, and this can only be accomplished when sufficient time is\r\nallowed for eating. It is not necessary that this be done to the extreme\r\nadvocated by some, but it is certainly of the highest importance that the\r\nfood be so thoroughly chewed that it is reduced to fine particles, and\r\nthat it should be so soaked in saliva that it may be swallowed without\r\nthe aid of liquids of any kind.\r\n\r\nIt is also desirable that food should not be taken while the individual\r\nis tired, so that it is a good plan where this condition exists for one\r\nto lie down for a short time before eating.\r\n\r\nRegularity in eating is likewise of importance, it being best to take the\r\nmeals at stated periods; the consumption of food at irregular hours often\r\nleads to indigestion and is a practice which should not be indulged in.\r\n\r\nIt is highly desirable to have food served under agreeable circumstances,\r\ndigestion being accomplished in a much more satisfactory manner if\r\npleasant conversation be indulged in during the meal, and if the food be\r\nof an appetizing character. Nothing is of more importance in connection\r\nwith this subject than to have the food properly prepared. Not only is\r\nthorough cooking important from the standpoint of making foods\r\ndigestible, but as is shown in another part of this volume, grave and\r\nsometimes fatal diseases are contracted by a neglect of this important\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\nFruits, contrary to what is generally thought, contain but little\r\nnourishment, and severely tax the digestive powers of those who have a\r\ntendency to dyspepsia. When eaten at all, they should be perfectly ripe\r\nand fresh, and should always be taken after meals rather than before.\r\n\r\n_Drinks,--Coffee, Tea, Milk, etc._--Much misconception exists, among\r\npeople generally, and even among the medical profession, concerning the\r\nproper amount of water that should be drunk. While this substance is\r\nunquestionably the most wholesome of all drinks, there exists no\r\nnecessity for taking it in great quantities at times when the system does\r\nnot call for it. It would perhaps be a good rule for all to form the\r\nhabit of drinking little while eating, the reason for which will be\r\nexplained hereafter.\r\n\r\nCoffee is exceedingly popular both on account of its delicious odor and\r\ntaste when properly made, and for the reason that it is highly\r\nstimulating. While it is borne by young and vigorous persons of either\r\nsex with apparent impunity, there frequently comes a time in life when it\r\ncan no longer be drunk without ill effects. As a general rule, dyspeptics\r\ndo not bear it well.\r\n\r\nTea, if properly prepared, is a most palatable beverage, and one that is\r\ngenerally better borne than coffee. It is more wholesome when taken\r\nwithout lemon juice, and like coffee it is less disposed to produce\r\ntrouble if largely diluted with milk, or if taken without cream or sugar.\r\n\r\nCocoa and chocolate are often used as substitutes for tea or coffee, and\r\nwhere they agree with the individual are perhaps as wholesome as either.\r\nBoth, however, contain considerable quantities of fat, and as they are\r\nfrequently prepared with cream, or very rich milk, they are not as a rule\r\nwell borne.\r\n\r\nWhile milk might be considered as being almost as much a food as a drink\r\nstill the fact that it is fluid, and that it contains a very large\r\npercentage of water, causes it to be regarded as a beverage. When taken\r\nslowly--and this precaution is particularly necessary where it is fresh\r\nand sweet--milk is a drink that should be regarded as being on a par with\r\nwater. It contains no injurious substances, but sour milk should, as a\r\nrule, be avoided by dyspeptics.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal principle in taking beverages of any kind at mealtime is\r\nthat they should be drunk alone after the food has been swallowed, as\r\nwhen they are taken with the purpose of softening the latter, mastication\r\nis seriously interfered with and the proper soaking of the food in the\r\nsaliva prevented.\r\n\r\n_Alcoholic Beverages._--Alcoholic drinks are so fully discussed in a\r\nlatter part of this book that here it may merely be stated that they\r\ncannot be regarded as having food-value to any degree, and so far as the\r\nmatter is at present understood, appear to be entirely superfluous, and\r\neven positively injurious. If taken at all, they should be consumed in\r\nextreme moderation, after meals rather than before. The young especially\r\nshould be particularly warned against the use of all beverages of this\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n_A Word on \"Soft Drinks.\"_--Mention should also be made of those drinks\r\ncommonly sold at soda-fountains. The vast majority of them may be taken\r\noccasionally without any appreciable ill effects, but the habitual use of\r\nbeverages containing considerable quantities of syrup is not entirely\r\nwholesome. Particularly is this true where the drink contains stimulating\r\ndrugs, such as do some of those most advertised. Some of them are, if no\r\nworse, the equivalent of a strong cup of coffee, and should, therefore,\r\nno more be taken every hour or two during the day than a cup of the\r\nsubstance just mentioned. If their use is persisted in, it is sure to be\r\nfollowed by indigestion, and in many instances nervous disorders of even\r\na serious character. The reader should also be warned against the use of\r\ndrinks containing medicine for the relief of pain--particularly those\r\nthat are advertised as remedies for headache. Practically without\r\nexception, all such drinks contain coal-tar preparations that greatly\r\ndepress the heart, and have in a number of instances been followed by\r\ndeath. Drugs of this character should be taken with the utmost\r\ncircumspection, and only on the prescription of a competent physician.\r\n\r\n_Tobacco._--Tobacco, of all nerve sedatives, is the most universally\r\nused. In moderation it could not be said that it is followed by any\r\napparent ill effects in the majority of people, but if used in excess\r\noftentimes sets up serious disturbances. It is peculiarly injurious to\r\nboys, and should never be indulged in until manhood is reached. Some\r\npersons seem to possess a natural immunity to the ill effects of\r\nnicotine, and appear to be able throughout their lives to chew or smoke\r\ntobacco in any amount without harmful results; such instances are,\r\nhowever, rare--its excessive use being usually followed by symptoms that\r\nmay be of a serious nature. Of the two methods of use perhaps smoking is\r\nless open to objection, though it is unquestionably true that chewing is\r\nnot so apt to cause disturbances of the heart. Smoking affects the\r\nstomach, but not to the extent that chewing does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSANITATION IN AND ABOUT THE HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bearing of intelligently located houses of proper construction on\r\nhealth is not so generally understood, even by physicians, as the facts\r\nwarrant, and, of course, is even less well recognized by the non-medical\r\npublic. It is true that some attention has been given to the matter of\r\n_location_, but even in this connection there prevails a woful ignorance\r\namong all classes as to just how the diseases are transmitted that are\r\nmost influenced in this way. As a result of recent advances in medicine\r\nit has been clearly shown that at least some of the diseases that are\r\nmost influenced by locality may be easily avoided, and as a consequence\r\nwe find that the views of the modern sanitarians have necessarily\r\nundergone a certain amount of change in this direction. On the other hand\r\nrecognition of the necessity of hygienic _construction_ has not been\r\nsufficiently accentuated,--since it is possible by proper attention to\r\nthe details of building to do away entirely with at least two of the\r\ndiseases that have heretofore been the principal drawbacks to life in all\r\ntropical and sub-tropical countries. Much importance likewise attaches to\r\nhouses being thoroughly ventilated, and to their being sufficiently roomy\r\nto properly accommodate their inmates. The following table shows the\r\nstriking relationship that mortality bears to over-crowding:--\r\n\r\n  RELATION OF DEATH-RATE TO DENSITY OF POPULATION.\r\n\r\n  City.              Mean number      Average death-rate\r\n                   of inhabitants   per 1,000 inhabitants.\r\n                   to each house.\r\n  London                  8                24\r\n  Berlin                 32                25\r\n  Paris                  35                28\r\n  St. Petersburg         52                41\r\n  Vienna                 55                47\r\n\r\nMany other statistics could be quoted, but all follow the general trend\r\nof those just given.\r\n\r\n_Choice of Site._--In our rural districts the inhabitants have a wide\r\nlatitude in the matter of the selection of the location for their\r\nhouses, and it is usually the case that our people are sufficiently\r\nintelligent to make the best use of their opportunities in this\r\ndirection. It may, however, be mentioned that it is generally considered\r\nthat building-sites in the neighborhood of cemeteries are not favorable\r\nlocations, nor should houses be erected in the vicinity of a\r\nmanufacturing plant that gives off injurious gases, or obnoxious\r\nmaterials of other kinds. Inasmuch as we now know that malaria is\r\ntransmitted by a certain mosquito, and that by properly screening the\r\nhouse their attacks may be avoided, the necessity no longer exists for\r\navoiding the vicinity of lakes and rivers as building-sites; such\r\nlocalities being as a rule pleasant and often picturesque, they would\r\nnaturally under ordinary circumstances be selected, and there now remains\r\nno reason why this may not be done,--provided that the house is so\r\nconstructed that mosquitoes can be effectually prevented from gaining\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\nOf much importance is the selection of a locality where good and pure\r\nwater can be easily procured, as otherwise disastrous consequences are\r\nsure to follow.\r\n\r\nThe soil should be of a light and porous character, easily permeable by\r\nwater, and free from the decomposing remains of excretions of man or\r\nanimals. There is much reason for the belief also that the level of the\r\nground-water plays a somewhat important part in the salubrity of any\r\ngiven locality, and it is generally considered that this should be at\r\nleast ten feet below the surface. It is generally thought, and probably\r\nwith truth, that those sites are most healthful which have their location\r\non a basis of granite, or other rock-foundation; in such localities there\r\nis usually a considerable slope of the general surface of the ground,\r\nwith the result that water rapidly runs off after rains, and consequently\r\nstagnant pools, which might serve as a breeding place for mosquitoes and\r\nbacteria, do not form. Soils through which water easily permeates are\r\nlikewise, as a rule, healthy, though this depends in a measure upon\r\nwhether or not they contain a very considerable proportion of vegetable\r\nmatter. Clay foundations are healthful where there is a considerable\r\nslope to the surface of the ground, but where this does not exist the\r\nsoil is damp, owing to its impermeability, and often has stagnant pools\r\nupon its surface. Marls and alluvial soils are not regarded as being\r\nwholesome, but it is not unlikely that their bad reputation is largely\r\ndue to the fact that they generally exist in the neighborhood of rivers\r\nand other considerable bodies of water where mosquitoes are numerous.\r\nThere are no reasons going to show that cultivated lands are\r\nunhealthy--even where they receive yearly abundant additions of manure.\r\nWhere it is necessary to build in damp localities the site should be\r\nthoroughly drained, and the space upon which the house is constructed\r\nshould be carefully covered with some impermeable cement.\r\n\r\n_Building Materials._--Of all building materials, the one most commonly\r\nemployed in America is wood. This arises from the fact that in the past\r\nwe have had unlimited quantities of timber from which lumber could be\r\nprocured at a price so reasonable that no other material could ordinarily\r\nbe considered. That the wooden house has some advantages cannot be\r\ndenied; its walls rapidly cool following the torrid days that so commonly\r\noccur during the summer in almost all portions of the United States, and\r\nit is usually well ventilated as a result of the numerous fissures\r\nnaturally existing in its structure.\r\n\r\nNext to wood, bricks are most commonly used for building purposes, and\r\nhave many advantages, among which are their handsome effect, their\r\nstability, and their being poor conductors of heat; the last mentioned is\r\nof considerable importance, since it keeps both heat and frost from\r\nrapidly permeating the interior, and as a consequence houses constructed\r\nof this material are cooler in summer and warmer in winter.\r\n\r\nOther materials occasionally used are concrete, granite, marble, and\r\nsandstone, any of which, on account of their durable character and the\r\nbeauty that they lend to structures made from them, may be selected for\r\nbuilding purposes, but inasmuch as they are rarely used in rural\r\ndistricts, a detailed consideration of their peculiar advantages for\r\nbuilding purposes is not deemed here necessary.\r\n\r\nThe internal wall-coating of houses deserves more consideration than is\r\ncommonly accorded it, since the dyes used for coloring wall-paper and\r\ncurtains in some instances contain noxious materials. Chief among those\r\nthat are dangerous are the bright green pigments which commonly contain\r\narsenic as their principal constituent; where these or other poisonous\r\nsubstances are employed in interior decorations the air, wherever the\r\nroom is kept closed, may become more or less impregnated with poisonous\r\ngases, and serious consequences to the inmates may ensue.\r\n\r\n_Screening Indispensable to Health._--Nothing is more important in\r\nconnection with house construction than having every opening thoroughly\r\nscreened. We have learned that both malaria and yellow fever are\r\ntransmitted always by certain kinds of mosquitoes, and it therefore,\r\nbecomes a matter of the greatest importance to effectually prevent the\r\nentrance of these insects. It cannot be too strongly insisted upon that\r\nwe absolutely know that the statement just made is correct, and that\r\navoiding the diseases referred to becomes as a consequence entirely a\r\nmatter of preventing the entrance of mosquitoes into houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. ANOPHELES. (Malarial Mosquito.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. CULEX. (Common Mosquito.)]\r\n\r\nThe _Anopheles_ mosquito, which is the one that transmits malaria, often\r\nexists in localities where the more common varieties do not occur, and on\r\naccount of the habits of this insect their presence is liable to be\r\noverlooked. They seldom attempt to bite during the day, and it is only\r\nrarely the case that they try to do so at night in a well lighted\r\nroom;--particularly where movement of any kind is going on. During the\r\nday this mosquito remains perfectly quiet in the dark corners of the\r\nhouse, and is very fond of resting on cobwebs, presenting, when doing so,\r\nan appearance strikingly similar to that of fragments of leaves, soot or\r\nof other natural objects that are frequently found suspended on such\r\nstructures. On account of these peculiarities and for the further reason\r\nthat the insect bites mainly just following daybreak, when the victim is\r\nprofoundly unconscious in sleep, its presence often remains undetected,\r\nand as a consequence we occasionally hear from those who do not take the\r\ntrouble to inform themselves that malaria exists in this or that locality\r\nwhere mosquitoes do not occur.\r\n\r\nThe yellow-fever mosquito bites for the most part during the day, but\r\nwill do so at any time when there is light. In districts where this\r\ndisease occurs it is quite as important to prevent its entrance as that\r\nof the malarial mosquito. Not only does screening prevent malaria and\r\nyellow fever, but it keeps out flies and other insects that\r\nunquestionably bring with them the germs of other diseases.\r\n\r\nThere now remains no doubt that several affections, notably typhoid fever\r\nand dysentery, are frequently communicated by means of the common\r\nhouse-fly, which spends its time alternately on the fecal material around\r\nprivies or in other filth, and in our kitchens and dining-rooms; it is\r\none of the most astounding evidences of the power of habit, in the face\r\nof common sense and ordinary decency, that we have not long ago taken\r\nactive steps to rid ourselves of its disgusting presence. Fortunately in\r\nscreens we have a perfect barrier to the entrance of flies, and no house\r\ncan be considered complete without being thoroughly equipped with these\r\nall-necessary appliances.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to overestimate the economy that results from the\r\nuse of screens; among the various means employed for conserving the\r\npublic health they take first rank, and undoubtedly insure those who live\r\nin houses to which they have been added an immunity against the costly\r\neffects of disease that could scarcely be computed. A house would be more\r\nhabitable without chairs, beds, or tables than screens, since in the\r\nabsence of the former we may be healthy, though somewhat uncomfortable,\r\nbut without the latter serious disorders are pretty certain, sooner or\r\nlater, to make their appearance.\r\n\r\nIt is of considerable importance to use a screen the mesh of which is\r\nsufficiently fine. Where mosquitoes exist, the screen should be of such\r\nfineness that at least sixteen, or better eighteen meshes be in each inch\r\nof the gauze. Where it is absolutely certain that mosquitoes are not to\r\nbe feared, the spaces may be somewhat larger--but always of such size as\r\nwill prevent the entrance of the smallest fly.\r\n\r\n_Air-space Required._--It is of much importance from a hygienic\r\nstandpoint that the rooms of dwellings should be sufficiently large. The\r\nheight should never be less than eight feet, and the living-room should\r\nbe made as large as circumstances will permit. Bed-chambers should\r\ncontain at least 1,000 cubic feet of air space for each adult, with\r\nsomewhat less for children, though it should never be forgotten that the\r\nmore the better; this means that each person should have the equivalent\r\nof a room which is at least 10 x 12 x 9 feet.\r\n\r\n_Heating._--Americans are extravagant in the matter of heating to a\r\ndegree that astonishes the average foreigner, and it is by no means sure\r\nthat we do not go to unhygienic extremes in this direction. It is not,\r\nperhaps, true that the excessive heat itself could be considered as\r\nespecially hurtful, but it is too often the case that the conditions\r\nrequired to secure the degree of heat preferred by us are incompatible\r\nwith proper ventilation, and hence are to be condemned. It is generally\r\nconsidered that the temperature of living-rooms should be somewhere about\r\n70°F.; for many persons this is lower than would be entirely comfortable,\r\nand as a consequence our houses in the winter are frequently kept nearer\r\n80°F. than the figure just given. The reader should be urged to see to it\r\nthat, at whatever temperature his habitation is kept, a sufficient amount\r\nof ventilation be secured.\r\n\r\nThere are many different methods of heating, the most satisfactory of\r\nwhich are by means of hot water or steam; a modified form of the latter\r\nis the so-called vapor method, which in recent years has proven extremely\r\nsatisfactory. Hot air, supplied by a furnace is also extensively used,\r\nand for the reason that by this method fresh air from the outside is\r\nconstantly brought into the house, it is theoretically to be commended;\r\npractically, however, a considerable difficulty is experienced in\r\nsecuring an equable distribution of this heat throughout the various\r\nparts of the house, and as a consequence it has not achieved the\r\npopularity that it would otherwise have done.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the installation of plants for heating by the methods just\r\nreferred to entails quite an expense, and for the further reason that\r\nthey require coal for satisfactory operating, they have not been employed\r\nin the rural districts of America to any considerable extent. The farmer,\r\nfor the most part, depends on the old open fireplace where wood is\r\nplentiful and the weather does not become excessively cold, while in\r\nthose portions of the country where the temperatures in winter go very\r\nlow, the stove is generally employed. Of the two methods, the former is\r\nmuch the more hygienic where it can be used successfully, but over a\r\ngreater portion of the United States this cannot be done owing to the\r\ncold winter climate.\r\n\r\nThe principal objection to the stove lies in the fact that the heat that\r\ncomes from it is very dry, and that where its walls have to be heated\r\nexcessively, unpleasant odors are apt to be generated; the former is\r\nusually and ought always to be obviated by keeping upon the stove a\r\nvessel of water, the vapors from which moisten the atmosphere, and the\r\nlatter by having the stove of such size that it will not require\r\nexcessive heating in order to warm the room in which it is placed.\r\nWherever possible the open fireplace is to be preferred to the stove for\r\nthe reason that it very thoroughly ventilates the room.\r\n\r\n_Ventilation._--In order that the health of the inmates may be conserved\r\nproper ventilation of all habitations is essential. However cold the\r\nweather may be, an abundance of fresh air should be allowed to enter all\r\nparts of the house. In the average wooden dwelling there are so many\r\ncracks that good ventilation is generally secured without opening doors\r\nor windows, but where the construction does not permit this, openings for\r\nthe entrance of air should be left in the most convenient and suitable\r\nplaces. Windows may be slightly raised and draughts prevented by proper\r\nscreening, or what is even better, rooms should be so constructed that\r\nthey have openings at the top and at the bottom to allow free\r\nventilation. Openings towards the upper portion of rooms are especially\r\nimportant in hot weather, as the warm air rises to the ceiling and\r\nescapes only very slowly where such exits do not exist. Lowering windows\r\nfrom the top aids materially in allowing the hot air to escape, but this\r\nis not altogether so satisfactory as having openings higher up on the\r\nwalls, or in the ceiling.\r\n\r\n_Disposal of Sewage._--No problem that confronts the dweller in the rural\r\ndistrict is of greater importance than the proper disposal of sewage. It\r\nis unfortunately impossible in most instances for the farmer to have in\r\nhis house a system of water-works, and, therefore, all dish-waters and\r\nslops are thrown into the yard, and a privy is used instead of a modern\r\nwater-closet. Where the lay of the land is such that water readily runs\r\noff, or the soil is of a character that permits rapid absorption,\r\nthrowing slops on the ground around the house may not constitute a danger\r\nto the inmates, but nothing is more certain than that the old fashioned\r\nprivy is a dire menace to the health of all those in its vicinity.\r\n\r\nNot only are infectious materials brought into houses by flies, from\r\nfecal matter and other excretions, but they are carried away by the\r\nrains and sometimes contaminate sources of water-supply. It is\r\nfurthermore extremely probable that bacteria in particles of dust from\r\ndried fecal material may be carried by the winds from privies into wells\r\nand houses, and as a consequence diseases may be spread; of perhaps still\r\nmore importance--and certainly of far greater moment all over the\r\nsouthern portions of the country--is the fact that hook-worm disease and\r\nother infections caused by animal parasites are transmitted from man to\r\nman as the result of our adherence to the old fashioned privy.\r\n\r\nAs will be explained in the chapter devoted to the common communicable\r\ndiseases, the eggs of the hook-worm pass from the intestine along with\r\nthe feces of those who are victims of this parasite and reaching the\r\nground, hatch out in the course of a few days minute hook-worm embryos,\r\nwhich crawl away and permeate the soil in the vicinity; later collecting\r\nin little pools that form after rains, or in dew-drops during the night,\r\nthey attach themselves to the skin of barefooted children who come in\r\ncontact with such collections of water, and boring into the body\r\nultimately, through a circuitous route, reach the intestines. Here they\r\nundergo further development, and in a short time become mature\r\nhook-worms, which in their turn lay eggs, and the life cycle begins over\r\nagain. It is thus seen that a child having hook-worm disease becomes a\r\nmenace, on account of the privy, to its brothers and sisters, and of\r\ncourse quite commonly receives back into its own body, worms that had\r\npreviously escaped as eggs.\r\n\r\nIn the same way eggs of the two common tapeworms pass out with the feces,\r\nand the offal containing them being eaten by hogs in the one case, or\r\nbeing scattered in the vicinity and taken in with grass by cows in the\r\nother, have their shells dissolved off as soon as they reach the stomachs\r\nof these animals, and there are liberated small embryos that bore through\r\nthe walls of the stomach and later find their way into the muscular\r\ntissues of these beasts, and there lie dormant until eaten by man with\r\nimperfectly cooked meat; after being swallowed, the embryo parasite\r\npasses to the intestine and soon becomes a fully developed tapeworm.\r\n\r\nParticular reference at this point should be directed to the evil\r\neffects, which are even still greater than those that come from the\r\nprivy, of permitting children and hired helpers to scatter their feces\r\nindiscriminately in corners of the yard, the apple-orchard, or in the\r\nhorse-lot; under such circumstances, where hook-worm disease is once\r\nintroduced, the soil in the course of a short time becomes thoroughly\r\npermeated with the embryos of this worm, and, as a consequence, all of\r\nthe children who play in the infected area barefooted, as is customary in\r\nthe country, are sooner or later infected with these parasites. It is\r\nthus seen that soil-pollution from fecal material is a most dangerous\r\nthing, and, particularly in the southern portion of the United States,\r\ndeserves the most earnest consideration of everyone. We should see to it\r\nthat our children only evacuate their bowels in properly constructed\r\nclosets; and it is the duty of the head of every family to provide such a\r\nplace for the accommodation of those who are dependent on him.\r\n\r\n_Proper Construction of Out-door Privies._--The most practical and\r\ngenerally satisfactory device heretofore invented for the disposal of\r\nthe sewage of communities unprovided with water-works is what is known as\r\nthe Rochdale, or dry-closet, system. By this system a privy, at a\r\ndistance from the dwelling, is constructed in the ordinary manner, with\r\nthe exception that instead of being open at the back it is tightly\r\nclosed. In the space beneath the seat receptacles are placed for\r\nreceiving the urine and feces. These may consist of pails of wood or\r\nbetter of galvanized iron; or a single box occupying the whole space. If\r\nwooden receptacles are used, they should be thoroughly coated on the\r\ninside with tar, to prevent both leakage and the soaking of the liquids\r\ninto the wood. One such structure, which the writer knows has been wholly\r\nsatisfactory has a brick foundation with walls two feet high around the\r\nfront and sides, within which rests a shallow tarred box. It ensures\r\nperfect cleanliness.\r\n\r\nIn any case this space under the seat is tightly closed, being guarded by\r\ndoors that open outward, through which the pails or box may be introduced\r\nand removed for emptying.\r\n\r\nEach privy contains a box in which is placed either wood ashes or dry\r\npowdered earth, with a small shovel by which a sufficient quantity of the\r\ndust to cover the deposit is thrown into the pail after each evacuation.\r\nIt is remarkable how completely this shovelful of earth or ashes destroys\r\nall disagreeable smell. The privy should be provided with at least two\r\nopposite windows, both of which should be thoroughly screened. The\r\nentrance should have a door that is closed with a spring, so that it\r\ncannot be carelessly or accidentally left open when vacant. At intervals\r\nthe pails containing the feces are removed, and the contents are carried\r\nto a distance and buried.\r\n\r\nAnother plan that is quite satisfactory where iron pails are used, is to\r\nplace a quantity of water in the vessels for receiving the feces, and\r\nthen to pour in a small quantity of kerosene; the latter substance forms\r\na layer over the water that keeps out flies, and does away largely with\r\nthe disagreeable odors that are likely to emanate.\r\n\r\nIf any contagious disease exists among those who use such a closet, the\r\nfecal material should be carefully sterilized before being removed, as\r\nby means of corrosive sublimate, carbolic acid, chlorinated lime, or any\r\none of the many commercial disinfectants containing crysylic acid, all of\r\nwhich may be obtained at any drug store. If carbolic acid or other liquid\r\nantiseptics be used the amount by volume should be equal to about five\r\nper cent. of the material to be treated; the proportion of corrosive\r\nsublimate should be at least 1 to 1,000 where this disinfectant is used.\r\nAlong with whatever antiseptic is chosen, water should be added in\r\nsufficient quantity to permit the whole to be rendered semi-fluid, and\r\nthe mixture should then be thoroughly stirred, and the chemical left to\r\nact for some hours before emptying the receptacle. By far the most\r\nsatisfactory method of sterilizing infected material, however, is by\r\nboiling, since disease-germs are killed by such a temperature in a few\r\nmoments. Where iron receptacles are used, therefore, the simplest method\r\nis to set them upon an open fire in the yard for a little while.\r\n\r\nA privy constructed after the manner just described possesses some\r\nadvantages even over the regulation water-closets that are used in\r\ncities, since they are cheaper in original cost, require less repairs,\r\nand are uninjured by a freezing temperature. The amount of care required\r\nto keep them in proper condition is not excessive, and they are so\r\ninfinitely superior from a hygienic standpoint to the old-time privy that\r\nno sort of comparison is possible.\r\n\r\nIt should always be remembered that the principal advantages of this\r\ncloset are that where it is used we are able to collect all of the\r\nevacuations, which may then be properly deodorized with soil or ashes,\r\nand that it may then be finally disposed of in such a way that it cannot\r\nbe reached by hogs or other animals; of very great importance also is the\r\nscreening of the closet, since only in this way is it possible to prevent\r\nflies from gaining entrance to the fecal material in the receiving pails.\r\n\r\n_Water supply._[2]--In the location of houses and schools an eye should\r\nalways be had to selecting a site where it is possible to obtain good,\r\npure water. To those fortunate dwellers in the mountainous regions of our\r\ncountry this is usually a matter of little difficulty, since it is always\r\npossible to find a location in the neighborhood of which the purest\r\nspring water may be obtained. In less favored regions the well becomes\r\nthe main reliance, while cisterns are used in some portions of our\r\ncountry, in which water is collected during the rainy seasons of the\r\nyear. Of the two, the former is undoubtedly to be preferred, provided a\r\npump be used instead of the old fashioned bucket. The writer is strongly\r\nof the opinion that a very large proportion of the contamination to which\r\nsources of water-supply are subject comes from the bucket being drunk\r\nfrom or handled by persons with contagious diseases, or from germs being\r\nblown into the well with dust, or carried in by means of insects and\r\nsmall animals. It is inconceivable that any appreciable amount of\r\ncontamination from the surface can reach the underground streams that\r\nsupply wells in localities that are thinly populated, though it is\r\nunquestionably true that a well might be infected as a result of the\r\nentrance of surface-water where its top is not properly protected. On the\r\nother hand we have in an open well or cistern every facility afforded for\r\nthe entrance of bacteria.\r\n\r\nIt is unquestionably of the utmost importance that wells be carefully\r\ncovered over, and every precaution should be taken to prevent\r\nsurface-water leaking into them around their edges. In order to comply\r\nwith these conditions a pump is essential, since it is the only means by\r\nwhich water can be brought to the surface without exposing the contents\r\nof the well to contamination. It is likewise of the first importance to\r\nhave the walls of the well curbed to a sufficient depth to prevent the\r\npossibility of seepage from the surface. It is, of course, also quite\r\nnecessary that the well be of sufficient depth--the lower we go the more\r\nlikely are we to secure a perfectly pure water. In regions where the\r\nwater rises to within eight or ten feet, or less, of the surface, the\r\npossibility of the well being contaminated during the rainy season by\r\nseepage is considerably increased, and the waters of such wells should be\r\nused only after analyses have shown that they are pure; where this cannot\r\nbe done, the water should be boiled before being drunk. Of course, the\r\npossibilities of contamination are greatly increased if the locality be\r\nthickly inhabited.\r\n\r\nAs has been before remarked, cisterns are more liable to contamination\r\nfrom the air than are wells, chiefly owing to the fact that they are\r\nsupplied by water that is conducted into them by gutters from the tops of\r\nhouses. There is no question that during the dry seasons dust containing\r\nmany kinds of bacteria is deposited all over the tops of houses and\r\nremains there until washed away by the rains. While it is true that the\r\nsunlight quickly kills most germs that produce disease a certain number\r\nof them would inevitably escape, and having gained entrance to a\r\ncistern, would be likely to multiply and later cause trouble. It is thus\r\nseen that however pure the rain-water may originally have been--and it is\r\namong the purest of all waters--it is likely to become contaminated in\r\nthe process of collection, and may ultimately in this way become the\r\nsource of disease. Where any doubt exists as to the purity of such water\r\nit should be boiled before use.\r\n\r\nSurface-streams also occasionally supply drinking-water in rural\r\ndistricts, and while the use of such waters may not always be attended by\r\ndanger, their contamination by disease-producing germs is much more to be\r\nfeared than when they are derived from wells or springs; where streams\r\narise from and keep their course through uninhabited districts the\r\nprobabilities are strong that their waters are pure and fit for use, but\r\nwhere they run through cultivated fields, and particularly where they\r\npass in the neighborhood of houses, their waters should never be looked\r\nupon as being drinkable,--except after being boiled or properly filtered.\r\nInasmuch as adequate filtration is exceedingly difficult to carry out,\r\nand requires a somewhat extensive and costly plant, this is, as a rule,\r\nnot feasible for the dweller in country districts, and boiling,\r\ntherefore, remains the only satisfactory method of rendering the water\r\nfit for use where doubt exists as to its purity.\r\n\r\n_Location of Pens and Stables for Animals._--Animals should always be\r\nhoused at some little distance from the dwelling. While it is true that\r\nman does not often contract directly diseases from hogs, sheep, horses\r\nand cattle, there are some maladies of a most serious character that come\r\nto us in this way, and we should, therefore, always guard against their\r\noccurrence by removing ourselves as far as is possible from sources of\r\npossible infection. The matter also has an æsthetic side, as odors of a\r\ndisagreeable character may prove very annoying where animals are kept too\r\nclose to the house. It is likewise of importance that stables should be,\r\nif possible, on lower ground than the dwelling, since during rains\r\nmaterials from their dung may be washed around and under the house, and\r\nmay possibly gain access to the well.\r\n\r\nEvery care should be taken to keep hog-pens and stables clean, since\r\notherwise very foul smells are engendered that oftentimes find their way\r\nto neighboring houses. There is also a suspicion that some of the germs\r\nthat produce disease find the conditions suitable for their stables\r\nand pig-sties.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it might be well to warn those unacquainted with the\r\nsubject against the _all too common practice_ of close association with\r\ndogs, since it is well established that in addition to hydrophobia they\r\nmay transmit, while apparently in perfect health, maladies of a deadly\r\ncharacter to the human being. It cannot be too often emphasized that the\r\nless intimate our association with the lower animals is, the greater the\r\nlikelihood of our escaping many serious diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] This subject is fully treated in another volume of this Library,\r\nentitled _Home Water-works_, written by PROF. CARLETON J. LYNDE. It\r\nshows where water should be sought, and how it may be supplied under\r\nperfectly safe conditions to the household, with descriptions of\r\nmachinery, estimates of expense, etc. This thoroughly practical book\r\nmeets a widely recognized need for information, and is written by a\r\nspecialist. Thousands of men living in rural parts of the United States\r\nand Canada, out of reach of a public water-system, have equipped their\r\nhomes with water-supply conveniences equal to any found in the cities.\r\nThousands more who could well afford to do so and who could do so\r\nadvantageously, have not done so for various reasons--because the idea\r\nhas not occurred to them, or because they did not know how to go about\r\nit, or because they mistakenly thought the expense too great. To all\r\nsuch this book should prove of the greatest practical help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHYGIENE OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nNo characteristic of the Caucasian mind is more marked, and none more\r\nuniversally affects his actions than a constant, gnawing suspicion that\r\nthe things going on around him are not being done in the proper way, and\r\nconsequently an irrepressible desire to experiment, and if possible, to\r\nchange everything. Such a spirit is unquestionably the basis of what we\r\ncall progress, and, in so far as it conduces to the health and happiness\r\nof mankind, is entitled to our most hearty commendation. On the other\r\nhand, it cannot be denied that too often we endeavor to bring about\r\nchanges with but an imperfect understanding of the basic principles at\r\nissue, and naturally, under such circumstances, our efforts are crowned\r\nwith anything but success. In other words, an enlightened investigation\r\nof the whys and wherefores of any existing state of affairs may and\r\noften does, lead to improvement, while, on the other hand, ignorant\r\nmeddling is likely to be followed by disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nNowhere do we see the bad results of false conceptions more marked than\r\nin our treatment of infants and children.\r\n\r\n     Particularly do young infants suffer in this way, as they are\r\n     pounced upon as soon as they enter the world by every old \"granny\"\r\n     and negro \"mammy\" in the neighborhood, and plied with abominable\r\n     concoctions that would be productive of homicide if we were to\r\n     attempt forcibly to administer them to grown men, and whose only\r\n     effect on the defenseless little sufferer is to cause colic and\r\n     indigestion. Many times has the writer seen a wee, tiny little\r\n     mortal, who was too young and weak to even protest, bundled up with\r\n     a mountain of flannels in the hottest weather of July and August.\r\n     True to the superstition that the warmer we kept an infant the\r\n     better, too frequently we see them confined to hot stuffy rooms\r\n     when they should be out in the sunshine, or under the trees.\r\n     Instead of being allowed to gain health and strength in the\r\n     forests, which are the schoolhouses of nature, the miserable little\r\n     wretch is later sent to a public school as soon as he or she can be\r\n     trusted to go alone on the streets, and the tiny victim too\r\n     frequently contracts diphtheria, scarlet fever, whooping-cough,\r\n     measles, or some other disease as a reward of merit. Truly we see\r\n     to it that the helpless innocents early realize the truth of the\r\n     melancholy and hopeless biblical lament that \"man's days here are\r\n     few and full of trouble.\"\r\n\r\nWe should rear our children with as little interference as possible,\r\nallowing them the utmost freedom compatible with their safety, and\r\npermitting them to do those things that nature and instinct demand. Above\r\nall let them sleep as much and as long as they will, insist that they\r\nlive in the open air, and encourage them in every possible way to perfect\r\ntheir physical education by those active amusements that they\r\ninstinctively prefer. After they have established a sound and rugged\r\nconstitution ample time will be left for them to develop mentally.\r\n\r\n_Feeding of Nursing Infants._--The most important thing in connection\r\nwith the feeding of infants is to always remember that nature has\r\nprovided in their mother's milk, when sufficiently abundant and normal in\r\nquality, everything in the way of food and drink that they require.\r\nDuring the three days that usually intervene between birth and the coming\r\nof the milk in the mother's breast, infants may be given from time to\r\ntime small quantities of pure water, but under no circumstances should\r\nanything else be allowed. During this period the child may be put to the\r\nbreast four or five times in the twenty-four hours, for, while it gets\r\nbut little in the way of nourishment, there is even at this time a watery\r\nfluid secreted in the breast that goes far towards supplying everything\r\nthat the infant needs for the time being.\r\n\r\nA child should never nurse longer than twenty minutes at one time. It is\r\nlikewise of importance that the time of nursing be strictly regulated.\r\n\r\nParticularly during the first year it is of the utmost importance to\r\nwatch with an intelligent eye the growth and development of the child.\r\nWhere the milk agrees with it it has a good color and gains regularly in\r\nweight; it cries but little, and is good natured, and thoroughly\r\ncontented. Should it, on the other hand, lose weight, appear fretful and\r\nlistless, and sleep badly, there is something wrong, and the mother\r\nshould at once have her milk examined by a competent physician.\r\n\r\nIn case the mother does not give sufficient nourishment there is no\r\nobjection to partially feeding the infant on modified cow's milk--the\r\nmethod of the preparation of which will be considered later on.\r\n\r\nWhere colic occurs it generally means that the infant is getting a diet\r\ntoo rich in albuminous foods, which should be corrected by advising the\r\nmother to take an abundance of out-door exercise, and to avoid all causes\r\nof worry so far as is possible.\r\n\r\nVomiting freely is a very common occurrence in small children, and is\r\nusually the result of too much food being taken at a time. It also\r\noccurs, particularly some time after feeding, as a result of indigestion,\r\nwhich is frequently the consequence of the milk being too rich in fats.\r\nWherever an infant shows signs of trouble it is well to advise the mother\r\nto use a diet less rich in meats, and to caution her against over-eating.\r\n\r\nChildren should be weaned at the end of their first year. This had best\r\nbe brought about gradually, by, in the beginning, feeding the child once\r\ndaily, and then gradually increasing the frequency, at the same time\r\nproportionately leaving off the nursing. Where children are not thriving,\r\nit is often a good practice to wean earlier, in which case modified cow's\r\nmilk, taken from a bottle, must be substituted.\r\n\r\n_Artificial Feeding._--While it is true that children often thrive for a\r\ntime on the various baby-foods with which the market is so abundantly\r\nsupplied, it is, nevertheless, the case that where fed in this way they\r\nare very apt to develop rickets or scurvy, and not uncommonly show\r\nevidences of bad nutrition in loss of weight and strength, becoming\r\npeevish and fretful, and sleeping badly.\r\n\r\nMuch better than any of the artificial foods is properly modified cow's\r\nmilk, which, with care, may be prepared in such a manner as to take the\r\nplace of mother's milk in the vast majority of instances. In order,\r\nhowever, that this be successfully carried out, much care and attention\r\nis necessary.\r\n\r\n     At this point it is well to stress the fact that the mother's milk\r\n     differs from that of the cow in some quite important particulars,\r\n     and it is only by intelligently taking these differences into\r\n     consideration that it is possible for us to prepare an artificial\r\n     food that will be satisfactory. Principal among these differences\r\n     are that cow's milk contains three times as much albuminous\r\n     material as that of the human being, and that it is less rich by\r\n     about half in milk-sugar; furthermore, the former is acid in\r\n     reaction, while the latter is neutral, or faintly alkaline. It will\r\n     be seen, then, that in order to prepare a modified cow's milk that\r\n     will approximate that of the human being it is necessary to dilute\r\n     it with water sufficiently to cause the albumin to approach in\r\n     proportion that of mother's milk, and at the same time some alkali\r\n     must be added to neutralize the excessive acidity. Modified milk\r\n     prepared, however, from the whole cow's milk, would contain much\r\n     less fat than is desirable, so that we must use in making it the\r\n     upper third of the whole milk after it has been allowed to remain\r\n     undisturbed for a number of hours; in other words, in making\r\n     modified cow's milk we use a large proportion of the cream, with a\r\n     less amount of the other constituents.\r\n\r\n     The following table for calculating the proper proportion of milk\r\n     to be used at the various periods of the infant's life may be\r\n     recommended, as it gives quite as satisfactory results as those\r\n     that are more elaborate; it also gives the frequency of feeding and\r\n     the proper amounts that should be used. The table was devised by\r\n     Dr. C. E. Boynton, of Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\n                   Fat      Quantity         No. of\r\n                percentage  ounces at     feedings in    Intervals\r\n                 desired.   feeding.       24 hours.      by day.\r\n\r\n     Premature     1.00      1/4 to 3/4      12-18      1 to 1-1/2 hrs.\r\n     1-4  day      1.00    1     to 1-1/2      6-10     2 to 4   \"\r\n     5-7    \"      1.50    1     to 2         10        2        \"\r\n     2-   week     2.00    2     to 2-1/2     10        2        \"\r\n     3-     \"      2.50    2     to 2-1/2     10        2        \"\r\n     4-8    \"      3.00    2-1/2 to 4          9        2-1/2    \"\r\n     2-   month    3.00    3     to 5          8        2-1/2    \"\r\n     4-     \"      3.50    3     to 5-1/2      7        3        \"\r\n     5-     \"      3.50    4     to 6          7        3        \"\r\n     6-10 month    4.00    5     to 8          6        3        \"\r\n     11-  month    4.00    6     to 9          5        4        \"\r\n     12-    \"      4.00    7     to 9          5        4        \"\r\n     13-    \"      4.00    7     to 10         5        4        \"\r\n\r\n     In making calculations from this table it is assumed that the milk\r\n     from the upper third of the bottle, after it has been allowed to\r\n     sit for at least four hours, contains 10% of fat, and this is\r\n     therefore called 10% milk. The calculation is made as follows:--10%\r\n     milk is to the fat percentage desired, as the amount which we wish\r\n     to make up is to X. For example, if we wish to prepare twenty\r\n     ounces of milk for an infant two months old, we will note by\r\n     referring to the table that 3% is the amount of fat that is\r\n     desirable for a milk for a child of this age, and the formula will\r\n     be constructed as follows:--\r\n\r\n       10:3::20:X.   X = 60/10.   X = 6.\r\n\r\n     Six ounces is then the amount of 10% milk that must be used for\r\n     making twenty ounces of modified milk,--this being mixed with one\r\n     ounce of lime-water and thirteen ounces of boiled water. It should\r\n     never be forgotten that while milk modified by the foregoing\r\n     formula is suitable for most children, it is by no means always\r\n     satisfactory, and we may, therefore, be compelled to do a\r\n     considerable amount of experimenting in some cases before arriving\r\n     at the correct formula.\r\n\r\n     Suppose the infant is twelve months old, we would get according to\r\n     the rules just stated the following equation:--\r\n\r\n       10:4::20:X.   X = 80/10.   X = 8.\r\n\r\n     Eight ounces would then be the amount of milk required for\r\n     preparing twenty ounces of modified milk for an infant of this age.\r\n\r\n     In preparing modified milk according to the formulas just given, it\r\n     must be remembered that in all instances only that portion is to be\r\n     used which collects in the upper third of a bottle of milk that has\r\n     been allowed to sit undisturbed in a refrigerator for at least four\r\n     hours. The lime-water is for the purpose of correcting the acidity\r\n     of the milk.\r\n\r\n     It is of much importance to select the milk from a healthy cow in\r\n     all instances where it is to be fed to infants, and where possible,\r\n     it should be examined by a competent laboratory man in order to\r\n     determine if it answers the proper requirements. The writer has\r\n     often seen milk from apparently healthy cows, which seemed in every\r\n     way good, that showed on microscopic examination pus cells and a\r\n     harmful germ (streptococcus).\r\n\r\n     It is not desirable to have a milk for this purpose that is too\r\n     rich in fats, and for this reason a cow of the ordinary mixed breed\r\n     is more satisfactory than the blooded Jerseys or Alderneys.\r\n\r\n     Not only is it essential to get the proper kind of milk, but the\r\n     utmost care is necessary in handling it. It should, of course, be\r\n     as free as possible from every source of contamination, and should\r\n     be strained thoroughly as soon as milked. It should then be\r\n     bottled, and chilled at once by being placed in cold water, and\r\n     after being properly sealed, should be placed in a refrigerator at\r\n     a temperature of about 50°F., where it should remain undisturbed\r\n     for four hours before the top portion is skimmed off for making the\r\n     modified milk.\r\n\r\n     After the modified milk has been prepared it should be returned to\r\n     the refrigerator, where it should be kept until required for\r\n     feeding. It is best not to use milk that has been in the\r\n     refrigerator longer than twenty-four hours, or at most forty-eight\r\n     hours, and then only if kept at a proper temperature. The modified\r\n     milk should be poured directly from the receptacle in which it is\r\n     kept into the feeding-bottle, and the latter should then be placed\r\n     in warm water until its content is milk-warm, at which time it is\r\n     ready to be given to the child.\r\n\r\nIt is highly necessary in feeding infants by the bottle to remember that\r\ncleanliness in everything connected with the process only makes success\r\npossible, and in no particular does this apply with greater force than in\r\nconnection with the proper care of the bottle and nipple. In every case\r\nimmediately after use they should both be put in water, which should then\r\nbe brought to a boiling temperature, and both should then be kept in a\r\nsaturated solution of boric acid. The nipple, after being placed on the\r\nbottle, should not come in contact with anything but the infant's mouth.\r\nBottles that have no neck are much to be preferred to others, as they can\r\nbe readily cleansed. There is on the market at the present time a bottle\r\ncalled the \"Hygeia,\" which possesses the necessary qualifications in a\r\nperfectly satisfactory way.\r\n\r\nWhen children who have nursed at the mother's breast reach the age of\r\nweaning it is of importance to remember that they cannot eat without\r\ndigestive disturbances the modified cow's milk of a strength that would\r\notherwise correspond to their age; they should invariably under such\r\ncircumstances begin with a milk prepared by the formula used for a child\r\nseveral months younger, after which the proportion of milk may be\r\ngradually increased until it is used in a pure state.\r\n\r\nDuring very warm weather it is well to reduce the amount of fat by using\r\nthe whole milk instead of the top portions, as heretofore described. The\r\nsame precaution should be followed where children have acute diseases,\r\nand the total quantity taken should be less than under ordinary\r\ncircumstances. Where infants have acute indigestion, accompanied by\r\nvomiting and diarrhoea, all milk should be for the time withheld,--boiled\r\nwater being substituted; some hours later barley water may be given, but\r\nno milk for at least twenty-four hours. Where children have loss of\r\nappetite, it is well to give less cream, and the intervals between food\r\nshould be increased.\r\n\r\n_Sterilized (Pasteurized) Milk._--During epidemics of dysentery,\r\ndiarrhoea, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, and diphtheria, as well as in\r\nthose instances where it is suspected that the cow is not healthy, or\r\nwhere the milk has to be kept for considerable periods of time, it is\r\nwell to sterilize it by heating. The most effective method of\r\naccomplishing this is by boiling the milk for an hour or so, but\r\ninasmuch as it is believed to be then not quite so wholesome as when less\r\nheat is employed, a process known as _pasteurization_ is frequently used;\r\nthis consists in heating the milk for thirty minutes to from 155° to\r\n160°F.,--such temperatures killing all of the ordinary germs, but not\r\naltering the milk so completely as when it is boiled.\r\n\r\n_Peptonized Milk._--It now and then happens that children fail to thrive\r\nwhere all of the precautions heretofore referred to have been strictly\r\nadhered to, and under such circumstances good results are frequently\r\nsecured by subjecting the milk to a process known as _peptonization_.\r\nThis consists in the addition of a digestive ferment, obtained from the\r\npancreas of lower animals, together with ordinary cooking-soda. In\r\ncarrying out the process the milk, whether whole or modified, is placed\r\nin a clean bottle, and the peptonizing powder added after having been\r\nrubbed up with a teaspoonful of milk. The container is then placed in a\r\npitcher of water at a temperature of 110°F., which is about as warm as\r\nthe hand can bear comfortably, and is here left for from ten to twenty\r\nminutes if only partial peptonization is desired, or for a couple of\r\nhours should it be wished to complete the process. The peptonized milk\r\nmay be prepared at each feeding, or the whole amount for the day may be\r\nmade at one time in the morning; in the latter case, where it is desired\r\nto have the milk only partially peptonized, the ferment should be\r\ndestroyed by boiling after it has been allowed to act for from ten to\r\ntwenty minutes.\r\n\r\n_Feeding after the First Year._--As the infant is weaned other food\r\nshould be gradually added; this should still consist largely of milk, to\r\nwhich some time later may be added gruels prepared from well-cooked oats\r\nor barley, beef-juice, or the white of an egg slightly cooked. The\r\nvarious broths may also be allowed. Children relish very much all\r\nfruit-juices, and they may be given in moderation without harm, and even\r\nwith benefit in many cases. As the child grows older, the various cereals\r\nshould form a greater and greater proportion of its diet, but due care\r\nshould be exercised in always seeing to it that they are thoroughly\r\ncooked; in order to be digestible for children such substances should be\r\ncooked at least three or four hours before eaten.\r\n\r\n_General Hygiene of Infant Life._--In order for children to be healthy,\r\nthe greatest regularity is necessary in their habits. They should arise\r\nat a certain hour in the morning and go to bed at a fixed time at night.\r\nTheir clothing should be loose, and not too tight fitting, and should at\r\nall times correspond to the state of the weather. Nothing is more common,\r\nand nothing produces irritability, loss of sleep, and even serious\r\ngeneral disturbances in infants, more frequently than too much clothing.\r\nIt is generally customary to use from the time of birth and during the\r\nperiod of infancy a flannel band around the child's abdomen. Just how\r\nthis acts is not clear, but there seems good reason for the belief that\r\nin some unexplained way the practice has the effect of warding off\r\nintestinal disturbances, and is, therefore, to be recommended.\r\n\r\nNapkins should be changed when soiled, and then should be immediately\r\nplaced in water, in which they should remain until washed out; under no\r\ncircumstances should they be left lying around the nursery.\r\n\r\nWhen the weather permits, the child should be kept as much out-of-doors\r\nas is possible. For the first few days of the infant's life, particularly\r\nif the weather be cool, it should, of course, be kept indoors, but even\r\nthen free access of air should be allowed. There is no objection whatever\r\nto the infant sleeping out-of-doors--in fact, where this is feasible, it\r\ngenerally shows improvement as soon as the practice is commenced. When\r\nout-of-doors, it is of course necessary to see that the sun does not\r\nshine directly into the infant's face, and wetting should, of course, be\r\navoided; also the hood of the carriage should be arranged to prevent\r\nstrong winds from blowing on the child.\r\n\r\nThe nursery should be well aired, a window being left up at night except\r\nduring severe weather.\r\n\r\n_Sleep._--Nothing is more important for the proper development of a child\r\nthan for it to have an abundance of sleep. During the first few months of\r\nits life it sleeps practically all of the time--the period becoming\r\ngradually lessened as it grows older. Infants should be suffered to sleep\r\njust as much as is possible, it being not only unjustifiable but\r\nabsolutely criminal to interfere with them in this particular in the\r\nslightest degree. Not only is it necessary that infants have all the\r\nsleep that they desire, but it is true throughout childhood, a fact to\r\nwhich many foolish parents seem utterly oblivious. How often do we see a\r\nchild scarcely more than an infant aroused in the morning and sent off to\r\nschool, and how frequently do we hear misguided parents boast of their\r\ninflexible rules in enforcing such evil practices. Truly man comes hard\r\nby the knowledge that nature is much wiser than he, and the vast majority\r\nnever learn the fact at all.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the child is able to crawl, it should be placed on a clean\r\nquilt or blanket on the floor, and allowed to move about to its heart's\r\ncontent. When it is able to walk, allow it to run about and play to its\r\nfull capacity--as in such exercises consists the great school of its\r\nphysical being, the school upon which will depend its strength and\r\nhealth in after life. Allow the child to keep up his play as long as he\r\nhas any inclination to do so, and never be so foolish as to confine him\r\nin the house when he wishes to be out under the blue heavens, for here\r\nonly will it be possible for him or her to develop into a real man or\r\nwoman. Allow this to go on until the child of its own accord comes and\r\nasks to be taught other things, for not until then is its outside\r\neducation nearing completion, and not until then is it possible for him\r\nto take interest in and learn things connected with books. No boy should\r\never be sent to school before he is twelve or fourteen years of age;\r\ngirls, on account of their maturing earlier, may begin a couple of years\r\nsooner.\r\n\r\nThe whole science and art of properly raising children consists in\r\nfeeding them good clean food in proper amounts, in never allowing them to\r\nbe awakened, and in permitting them to play in the open air to their\r\nhearts' content.\r\n\r\n_Teething._--Teething is a subject which has at all times interested both\r\ndoctor and layman, and in its supposed relation to all kinds of\r\ndisorders of infancy has undoubtedly exercised an influence over the\r\npopular imagination out of all proportion to its real importance. Too\r\noften it has happened that this perfectly normal, and usually by no means\r\nserious, process, has been held responsible for grave diseases in\r\nchildren--diseases which in reality were the consequence of neglect\r\nand mismanagement in the far more serious matters of food, sleep,\r\nout-of-door exercises, and general hygiene. It cannot, however, be\r\ndenied--particularly in respect to nervous children--that teething\r\nappears occasionally to induce unpleasant disturbances, such as\r\nfretfulness, broken sleep, digestive disorders, and occasionally fever;\r\nas a rule such symptoms persist only for a few days, if the infant be\r\nproperly looked after. The treatment should consist in lancing the gums\r\nshould they become much swollen, and the withholding of the usual amount\r\nof food, particularly where intestinal disturbances occur. The ages at\r\nwhich the teeth usually come are as follows:\r\n\r\n  2  Middle Lower Teeth                5 to  9 months.\r\n  4  Upper Front Teeth                 8 to 12 months.\r\n     Remaining Lower Front Teeth      12 to 18 months.\r\n  4  Front Jaw Teeth                  12 to 18 months.\r\n     Stomach Teeth (Canine)           18 to 24 months.\r\n     Eye Teeth (Canine)               18 to 24 months.\r\n  4  Back Jaw Teeth                   24 to 30 months.\r\n\r\n_Bowel Diseases._--Digestive disturbances, accompanied by diarrhoea, are\r\nthe bane of infancy, and are responsible for a very large part of the\r\nfrightful mortality among babies. The subject, therefore, is one of\r\ntremendous importance, but is so complicated that the limits of this\r\nlittle volume will only permit its being touched upon.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, indigestion accompanied by looseness of the bowels\r\nmay be and often is the result of milk being used from diseased cows, or\r\nit may be the consequence of such carelessness in handling it that\r\ndisease-producing bacteria are later allowed to contaminate it. It should\r\nalso never be forgotten that where children are eating artificially\r\nprepared food improper mixing of the different components may result in\r\nserious disturbances, and we should, therefore, exercise the utmost care\r\nalways in seeing to it that the food is prepared strictly according to\r\nthe table which has already been given--not forgetting that in a certain\r\nnumber of instances we can go by no rule, and will have to experiment\r\nuntil we ascertain the proper proportion of the ingredients.\r\n\r\nAfter a diarrhoea begins we should at once reduce the quantity of fat in\r\nthe milk that is being given to the infant, and if the trouble be at all\r\nsevere it is best to take it off of all food for twenty-four hours, and\r\nsubstitute boiled water or barley-water. As soon as the trouble is\r\nchecked we may then begin to feed cautiously with largely diluted milk,\r\nand, gradually increasing its strength, in the course of a few days\r\nreturn to the food that was being given before the disturbance occurred.\r\nA dose of calomel or castor oil in the beginning of diarrhoeal troubles\r\noften has a very salutary effect; the parent should not hesitate to\r\nadminister this if a doctor is not at hand.\r\n\r\nIn warm climates during the time of teething children very commonly\r\ndevelop chronic diarrhoeal conditions which often end fatally; wherever\r\npossible the parent should under such circumstances at once remove the\r\nlittle sufferer to a colder climate where recovery is generally rapid and\r\ncomplete. Even the most careful nursing under the most competent\r\nphysician is often fruitless in combating disorders of this character as\r\nlong as the infant remains in a warm climate.\r\n\r\n_Colic._--Colic is always due to indigestion, and is the result of the\r\nfood undergoing fermentative changes, with the production of gases. This\r\ngoes on even under normal conditions to a certain extent, but when it is\r\nexcessive the intestines become greatly distended, and pain of a severe\r\nor even agonizing character is produced.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of this condition warm applications should be made to\r\nthe abdomen, and as quickly as possible an enema (injection), consisting\r\nof a few ounces of warm solution of salt water should be given; the salt\r\nshould be in the proportion of a level teaspoonful to the quart of water.\r\nParents will find the little ear syringe, which may be purchased at any\r\ndrug store, a most satisfactory instrument for giving enemas to infants,\r\nas they do not hold too much, and being soft, are incapable of tearing\r\nthe delicate tissues of the child. It is of the utmost importance to\r\nremember that the salt solution should be tepid, yet not sufficiently hot\r\nto scald the infant. As the water when given in this way is expelled very\r\nquickly the enemas may be repeated any number of times desired.\r\n\r\nWhere these measures fail, a physician should be sent for at once, but in\r\nthe meantime if it be evident that the infant is suffering very much, a\r\nsmall dose of paregoric may be given; it should not however be forgotten\r\nthat opiates are exceedingly hurtful to nervous children, and that\r\nsoothing syrups and other mixtures containing drugs of this class should\r\nbe avoided.\r\n\r\n_Constipation._--Constipation among very young children generally passes\r\noff as the food becomes richer, but should it occur at a later time, the\r\ntrouble may be more difficult to remedy. Of first importance is having\r\nthe bowels of the infant move at a certain time each day, which may be\r\nquickly accomplished in many little children by placing them upon a small\r\nchamber daily at a given hour; usually the baby very quickly learns what\r\nthis procedure means, and in this way a regular habit is established\r\nwhich is of the utmost value to the child throughout its infancy, and\r\nevery effort, therefore, should be made to bring it about as quickly as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe addition of malted milk or Mellin's Food may also have the effect of\r\ndiminishing constipation;--the result being brought about by the maltose\r\ncontained in these preparations. The same thing may be accomplished by\r\nsubstituting for a part of the milk sugar in the baby's food a similar\r\nquantity of maltose. Milk of magnesia may be used in preparing the baby's\r\nfood in the place of lime-water, with the result oftentimes of relieving\r\na tendency to constipation.\r\n\r\n_Croup._--By croup is meant a spasmodic condition which usually affects\r\nchildren at night, and is in no way to be confounded with that really\r\ndangerous disease, membranous croup, or diphtheria, to which so many\r\nchildren fall victims.\r\n\r\nSpasmodic croup is a condition which has as its basis digestive\r\ndisturbances, and is almost always relieved as soon as the stomach is\r\nemptied. Vomiting may be brought about by making the child swallow a\r\nsmall quantity of mustard stirred up in water, or by the use of ipecac.\r\nSuch severe and extremely unpleasant remedies are rarely necessary,\r\nhowever, since the disease may be in almost all instances at once\r\nrelieved by placing around the victim's throat a cloth wrung out of cold\r\nwater, which may itself be covered by a dry bandage to prevent the bed\r\nfrom getting wet. Children will usually go to sleep in a few minutes\r\nafter the cold cloth is applied, and suffer no ill consequences as a\r\nresult of its remaining around their throats throughout the night. Where\r\nthe croup is very severe the little sufferer's feet may be placed in hot\r\nwater, in addition to the cold cloth around the neck--the combination\r\npractically always resulting in the rapid relief of the unpleasant\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nGreat care should be exercised in the diet of children who are subject to\r\ncroup, as by intelligent supervision the tendency to this very annoying\r\ntrouble may be in a short time entirely overcome.\r\n\r\n_Nervousness._--Children of neurotic parents, particularly where they are\r\nreared in cities, are exceedingly prone to nervousness in one form or\r\nanother. The condition is undoubtedly often due to heredity, but may be\r\ninduced in otherwise healthy children by unhygienic surroundings and\r\nimproper food. Infants exhibiting symptoms that indicate trouble of this\r\nkind should not be played with, and every care should be exercised to so\r\ndirect their lives that the trouble may be gradually overcome. In all\r\ncases where nervousness persists an intelligent physician should be\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\n_Vaccination._--The only safe method that we possess of preventing\r\nsmall-pox is by means of vaccination. Its great value has been so\r\nthoroughly tested that the writer does not deem it necessary to go into a\r\ndiscussion as to its merits. A child should be vaccinated in at least\r\nthree places during its early infancy,--there being no danger in doing\r\nthe operation immediately after birth. Persons ignorant of aseptic\r\nsurgery should not do this operation, but should always call in the\r\nservices of some person prepared to do the work in a cleanly manner.\r\nEither the leg or the arm may be selected; and children should be\r\nrevaccinated whenever small-pox breaks out in the community.\r\n\r\n_Kissing Babies to be Avoided._--Kissing infants in the mouth is a very\r\nbad practice, as in this way disease may be quite innocently conveyed to\r\nthem. The public should be taught to understand that it is not\r\ninfrequently the case that bacteria may be present in the mouths of\r\nindividuals who are quite immune to their ill effects, and who are,\r\ntherefore, perfectly well, but who may, by conveying them to others,\r\nparticularly children, induce in them serious disease. When caressed in\r\nthis way at all children should be kissed upon their necks or feet, and\r\nnever in their mouths or on their hands.\r\n\r\n_Juvenile Contagious Diseases._--Children are peculiarly prone to a class\r\nof highly contagious diseases, the exact nature of which is not yet\r\nunderstood, and we possess therefore little knowledge as to the proper\r\nmeans of preventing their spread. Practically all that is known about\r\nthem is that they are conveyed by contact, or even by the air,\r\nparticularly where a child suffering from one of them is placed in a\r\nconfined place with another who is susceptible; these diseases likewise\r\nmay be carried by means of clothing and other articles that have been in\r\nclose contact with a child suffering with any of them. The lesson of\r\nimportance to be learned, therefore, is that if we wish our children to\r\nescape maladies of this class we should not permit their indiscriminate\r\nassociation with others. As these diseases cease to be a serious menace\r\nafter children have passed through their earlier years it does not at a\r\nlater time matter so much as to whether they are exposed to them or not.\r\nAs a general thing children develop these affections in from ten to\r\nfifteen days after having been exposed, though one of the most severe of\r\nthem, scarlet fever, may make its appearance as early as twenty-four\r\nhours after it is contracted. These diseases are usually ushered in by a\r\nsevere headache, pains in the head, back, and limbs, high fever, and\r\noftentimes a chill. As soon as a child develops such symptoms the advice\r\nof a competent medical man should be at once sought, and the little\r\nsufferer should be at once completely isolated.\r\n\r\nIn concluding, the writer would particularly exhort parents to obey to\r\nthe letter the instructions of their physicians, and never under any\r\ncircumstances to dose their helpless off-spring with patent or\r\nproprietary medicines, which contain no man knows what, and which\r\nunquestionably are often highly injurious, especially to children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPROPER EATING--THE SECRET OF GOOD HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nVery slowly the world is awakening to the fact that no agencies play such\r\nan important part in the preservation of health as the consumption of\r\nreasonable quantities of well-cooked and properly selected food, and the\r\nhabitual taking of wholesome drinks. On all sides the observant medical\r\nman sees constant and reckless disregard of the simplest and most\r\nfundamental laws governing this subject. Nothing is more common than to\r\nhear of men in the prime of life being seized with what is called a\r\n\"nervous breakdown,\"--which generally means a digestive breakdown--to be\r\nfollowed by an era of misery for the unfortunate subject and his scarcely\r\nhappier family. Nervous and irritable, the slightest inconveniences are\r\nmagnified into terrible calamities, he constantly fears death, and his\r\nsleepless nights become a saturnalia of gloomy thoughts and abject\r\nfears.\r\n\r\nOf course, not everyone guilty of dietetic sins goes through such sad\r\nexperiences, for the naturally strong frequently escape the consequences\r\nof their rashness, particularly where they live in the rural districts\r\nand take plenty of out-door exercise. Let not such, however, flatter\r\nthemselves that their disregard of hygienic laws will go unpunished.\r\nAfter indiscretions in eating they will all, at one time or another, have\r\nacute indigestion with diarrhoea; and how often does the previously well\r\nand hearty man after indiscretion in eating wake up with a dull headache,\r\nfurred tongue, foul breath, and a general feeling of sluggishness and\r\nmental depression?\r\n\r\nIs it his liver? Our unscientific medical ancestors--at a loss to account\r\nfor the state of affairs in any other way--answered in the affirmative,\r\nand, believing it was produced by a collection of bile in the liver,\r\ncalled the condition \"biliousness.\" How absurd modern science has shown\r\nthis assumption to be! We now know that the liver is rarely diseased,\r\nand that it furnishes its secretion, called bile, for the purpose of\r\naiding digestion rather than hindering it, and that this substance is\r\nrarely, if ever, produced in excess. It is undigested, putrefying food in\r\nthe intestinal tract that produces the trouble. Under such circumstances\r\none usually takes a dose of calomel, which, being perhaps the most\r\nsatisfactory and perfect purgative that we possess, relieves the\r\ncondition promptly by getting rid of the offending material; but the drug\r\ndoes not act on the liver.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately ill results of quite a different and a much more serious\r\ncharacter often follow in the wake of dietetic errors; in those who have\r\na tendency to consumption, particularly where they overwork, this dread\r\ndisease frequently makes its appearance as a consequence of bad eating\r\nand drinking. Many, if not all, of the degenerative diseases that appear\r\nin the latter half of life are produced in this way, and nothing is more\r\ncertain than that the peace, happiness and longevity of mankind could be\r\nincalculably increased by the simple observance of what is known\r\nconcerning proper eating and drinking.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider the very important subject of the quantity and\r\ncharacter of foods which should be taken in health, with suggestions as\r\nto those most suitable for dyspeptics.\r\n\r\n_Over-eating too Prevalent._--The majority of us take much more food than\r\nis necessary, with the result that we suffer from indigestion.\r\n\r\nWhen we consume more than a reasonable amount of food habitually serious\r\ndigestive disturbances are sure to result,--to be often followed at a\r\nlater time by tuberculosis, morbid alterations in the blood-vessels,\r\nBright's disease, and other serious maladies of a chronic nature.\r\nProfessor Chittenden, who is America's greatest physiological chemist,\r\nhas demonstrated that in all probability previous workers along these\r\nlines have been excessive in their estimates as to the amount of food\r\nrequired. He showed that a man could live for a period of nine months on\r\na daily ration which contained about one-third of the usual amount of\r\nproteids generally thought to be necessary, and at the same time the fats\r\nand carbohydrates were reduced to such a degree that the total number of\r\nheat units, or calories, liberated from the food scarcely exceeded in\r\nnumber one-half of the standard requirements. He also experimented on\r\nthirteen volunteers from the hospital corps of the United States Army, to\r\nwhom he daily fed rations of only 2,000 calories, and, notwithstanding\r\nthat they engaged in physical work, all were found to be in better\r\ncondition at the end of six months than they were at the beginning.\r\n\r\nThese results strongly point to the conclusion that previous estimates as\r\nto the quantity of food required are erroneous, and that man can not only\r\nlive, but may continue in strength and health on much smaller amounts. It\r\nis highly probable that this discrepancy may be accounted for, at least\r\nto a considerable extent, by the assumption that much of the food\r\nordinarily taken is rejected by the system, and passes out as waste,\r\nwhile, when small quantities are eaten, it is for the most part absorbed.\r\n\r\n_Mastication._--Thorough chewing of the food is absolutely essential for\r\nproper digestion. While it is true that this, like all other good things\r\nin life, may be, and often is, carried to an unnecessary extreme, it is\r\ncertainly true that we would be infinitely better off if we were to go\r\nto the extent in this direction of so called \"Fletcherism\" rather than\r\nperform this most important function in an indifferent manner.\r\n\r\nThis rule applies with especial force to food of a starchy\r\nnature,--bread, potatoes, oatmeal, rice, etc. In order to digest food of\r\nthis character it must be very thoroughly cooked and when finally placed\r\nupon the table it should be of such consistence that it requires chewing\r\nbefore it can be swallowed. Not only is this necessary from the\r\nstandpoint of breaking up the larger particles into smaller ones, thus\r\npermitting the food to pass freely through the stomach and intestine, but\r\nit is of the greatest importance for it to be thoroughly soaked with the\r\nsaliva during the process. It is thus of no advantage for starches to be\r\nserved in a finely divided form--in fact it is directly the contrary,\r\nsince under such circumstances it is almost always the case that such\r\nfoods are swallowed without having been insalivated.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said concerning the mastication of starches applies with\r\nalmost equal force to other foods. Without exception their digestibility\r\nis much increased by thorough chewing. As the result of recent\r\nexperiments carried out by means of the X-ray, it has been shown that\r\nparticles of food of any considerable size will not pass from the stomach\r\ninto the intestine; as often as an object of this kind attempts to force\r\nits way from the former into the latter the opening between the two\r\ncloses, and as a consequence the food is retained in the stomach longer\r\nthan it is in health--resulting in the course of time in catarrhal\r\nconditions of the organ just named, and an unnatural relaxation of its\r\nmuscular walls. Under such circumstances the patient quickly develops\r\nsymptoms of indigestion, and if his habits be not corrected the trouble\r\ngradually grows worse until the sufferer becomes a chronic dyspeptic.\r\n\r\n_Classes of Nutritive Substances._--All substances that are of any\r\nappreciable value in nutrition may be divided into those that are\r\nnitrogenous in character (albumins, legumins), the carbohydrates\r\n(starches and sugars) and compound ethers (fats). Of all these the\r\nnitrogenous foods are the most important, since they contain the material\r\nfrom which the great bulk of the body is largely composed, and at the\r\nsame time there is every evidence that in case of need they may be broken\r\nup into chemical substances that may take the place of any of the other\r\nkinds of foods; upon nitrogenous food, then, a man may live alone, while\r\nthis cannot be done on other articles of diet. The fats, starches and\r\nsugars are very closely related to each other, and it is generally\r\nbelieved that they subserve much the same end in the economy; by\r\nundergoing chemical change they furnish energy (heat and muscular force)\r\nand are undoubtedly largely responsible for the formation of the fats of\r\nthe body. While there is some evidence that under certain conditions\r\nalcohol may be a food, its value is certainly very small, and it is not\r\nof sufficient importance to be considered in this connection. The ideal\r\ndiet then for a healthy man is a proper proportion of nitrogenous\r\n(albuminous) food, along with a reasonable portion of fats, starches and\r\nsugars. Professors Voight and Atwater have calculated the following\r\ntable, which fairly represents the amount of proteids, fats and\r\ncarbohydrates that should compose the rations for twenty-four hours for\r\nthe ordinary adult male.\r\n\r\n  ADULT MALE OF AVERAGE WEIGHT.\r\n\r\n                   At Rest.

The \"calorie\" is the amount of heat\r\nrequired to raise the temperature of one gramme of water 1°C. It has been\r\nestimated that starches, sugars and albumins liberate during combustion\r\n4.1 calories per gramme, while fats produce 9.3 calories. It will be\r\nnoted that in the tables just given the total number of calories is in\r\neach instance somewhere in the neighborhood of 3,500, which is\r\nconsidered to be about the number of heat units required by the average\r\nman at moderate muscular work. The weight of the average woman being less\r\nthan that of the adult male, a reduction of about 20 per cent. from the\r\nforegoing figures would approximate the amount of food required by the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBREAD AND ITS RELATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt all times, and among all peoples, bread has been recognized as one of\r\nthe great staple articles of diet. Although its commonly quoted\r\ndesignation, \"the staff of life,\" would more appropriately belong to the\r\nalbumins, there can be no question that breads of one kind or another are\r\namong the most wholesome and necessary of all food-substances. Not alone\r\nis this true on account of the starch of which they are largely composed,\r\nbut they contain more or less vegetable albumin; it is thus seen that\r\nbread is a mixture of the two most important food-stuffs, starch and\r\nalbumin, but the quantity of the latter is so small that an individual\r\nwould have to eat an enormous amount of the mixture to secure enough of\r\nthis ingredient to meet the needs of the body. For practical purposes,\r\nthen, we may regard bread as being starch.\r\n\r\n     Within recent years quacks have disseminated very widely throughout\r\n     this country the error that foods are more digestible when raw. It\r\n     was long ago demonstrated that pure albumins, of which eggs and\r\n     milk are the nearest natural examples among foods, are assimilated\r\n     somewhat better when eaten raw, but this applies to no other foods\r\n     except sugars. Any success that has followed the teachings just\r\n     referred to undoubtedly rests purely on the fact that their\r\n     followers are instructed to live largely on raw eggs and milk, and\r\n     as the patient usually discovers in a short time that these two\r\n     foods agree with him while other uncooked ones do not, he naturally\r\n     eats them to the exclusion of the rest and where he takes a\r\n     sufficient quantity increases in weight and strength.\r\n\r\n     The idea that starches are more digestible when eaten raw could be\r\n     easily refuted by any intelligent farm-boy who recalls one or more\r\n     sad experiences from over-indulgence in raw sweet potatoes.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we look upon as bread? Of course all such food-stuffs as are\r\ncommonly included within this designation are to be accepted; such as\r\nwheat-bread, graham-bread, whole-wheat bread, biscuits, rolls, light\r\nbread, bakers' bread, waffles and batter-cakes, rye bread, corn bread,\r\npreparations of corn-starch, with which we should place those articles of\r\ndiet so commonly used in the south, usually called grits, hominy,\r\negg-bread, muffins, corn-meal cakes, potatoes, both sweet and Irish,\r\narrowroot and the so-called cereals or breakfast-foods, including\r\noatmeal.\r\n\r\nNow which of these is the most wholesome? This inquiry cannot be answered\r\nconclusively for the reason that the digestibility of this, as of other\r\nfoods, depends largely on the individual. For the sake of clearness the\r\nvarious breads will now be considered in detail.\r\n\r\n_Wheat-bread the Best._--It may be confidently asserted that well-cooked\r\nand perfectly dry wheat-breads are to be regarded as being generally the\r\nmost digestible of all bread-stuffs. This is not dependent on any\r\ninherent property in wheaten starch as a result of which it is acted upon\r\nmore readily by the juices whose office it is to render it fit for\r\nabsorption in the body, but is wholly due to the fact that breads of\r\nwheat-flour may be made very dry and light.\r\n\r\nAs has been already explained, it is particularly necessary that starches\r\nshould be thoroughly soaked in saliva, and this can only be accomplished\r\nwhen the bread is of such consistence that it must be chewed for a time,\r\nand so dry that it will readily absorb the salivary secretion. The\r\nwriter, then, would advocate well cooked light-bread or bakers' bread, or\r\ntoast made from either, as being the best of all food-stuffs of this\r\ncharacter. The crusts of biscuit a day or so old are quite digestible, as\r\nare also waffles, if made with little grease and cooked thoroughly. The\r\nsoft inner portion of biscuit and that of hot rolls, as well as\r\nbatter-cakes, is decidedly unwholesome.\r\n\r\nGraham-bread should not be constantly indulged in for the reason that it\r\ncontains multitudes of sharp particles of the husk of the grain that cut\r\nthe delicate mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines as it passes\r\nalong, and if its use be long and continued, severe ill effects\r\nnecessarily follow.\r\n\r\n     In this connection attention should also be called to the common\r\n     error that particles of husk are of advantage to breads of all\r\n     sorts; the former consist chemically of exactly the same thing as\r\n     sand, and are quite as indigestible, and this, in connection with\r\n     what has just been said of their action on the delicate mucous\r\n     membranes of the intestinal tract, should be quite enough to\r\n     convince anyone that they are not only useless, but injurious. It\r\n     is true that the irritation produced by the husk will oftentimes\r\n     cause the bowels to act, but results of the same character may be\r\n     induced by many other agencies, within themselves less harmful.\r\n\r\n_Rye-bread._--There is no reason why rye-bread should not be prepared in\r\nquite as wholesome a way as is wheaten-bread, and this grain should\r\nundoubtedly rank as one of the best of the cereals. Its use, however, is\r\nso limited in this country that it is scarcely necessary to go into a\r\nlengthy discussion as to its merits. It may be remarked that the ergot\r\nfungus frequently grows on this grain, and when ground up with it\r\noccasionally poisons the consumer where the quantity of the substance is\r\nlarge and the bread is eaten in considerable quantities. Instances of\r\nthis kind are not uncommon among the peasantry of Europe, where a black\r\nbread made from rye is the staple article of diet. Of course, when making\r\nfood-preparations of rye, we should be careful to have the flour\r\nthoroughly winnowed, and to cook the bread until sufficiently dry to\r\nacquire a proper consistency for chewing.\r\n\r\n_Corn-bread and Corn Food-products._--When made from perfectly sound\r\ngrain, and if not allowed to undergo fermentative changes afterward,\r\nthere can be no question that food-products of corn are entirely\r\nwholesome, and, from the standpoint of chemical composition, quite as\r\nnourishing as similar articles of diet prepared from other grains. It is,\r\nhowever, unfortunately true that we cannot, in the majority of instances,\r\ndefinitely assure ourselves that our corn-bread is made from grain that\r\ncomes up to the above specification, nor can we be sure that the meal is\r\nfresh, or preserved at such a temperature as would forbid the growth of\r\nvarious germs. It has long been known that bad corn would kill horses,\r\nbut notwithstanding this, we have accepted the view that no amount of\r\ndeterioration in the grain could result harmfully to man. That this\r\nlatter assumption is incorrect seems now in the highest degree probable.\r\n\r\n     _Pellagra._--It is known that a very curious and fatal disease\r\n     called pellagra is prevalent to a considerable degree at the\r\n     present time in the United States, and it is not going too far to\r\n     say that all of those best capable of judging are of the opinion\r\n     that the malady is the result of eating just such corn as we know\r\n     kills horses.\r\n\r\n     It is likewise true that the nutritive power of this grain could in\r\n     no way be increased by allowing it to decay before consumption;\r\n     indeed, the contrary must be the case, and, if it were in no manner\r\n     actually harmful, our sense of the æsthetic and of what is proper\r\n     to eat, should make us reject in this case, as with other foods,\r\n     that which is unsightly to the eye and unpleasant to the taste. We\r\n     should no more eat bad grain than a rotten apple, or putrefying\r\n     meat. The increased prevalence of pellagra is exciting attention\r\n     all over the United States, and is very generally assumed to be the\r\n     result of lack of care in the harvesting and preservation of our\r\n     corn. Instead of being cut before it is ripe, and shocked in the\r\n     field during the latter part of the summer, it should be allowed to\r\n     ripen on the stalk, and after cold weather sets in gathered while\r\n     dry, and preserved in well-covered and well-ventilated barns. Every\r\n     care should be taken to keep it dry while being shipped from one\r\n     part of the country to another, and similar precaution should be\r\n     observed with the various food-products made from it. If kept in a\r\n     cold place, meal or grits made of good corn may be preserved in\r\n     excellent condition for eating throughout the winter; but as soon\r\n     as the warm weather begins they should be stored in the\r\n     refrigerator, and should there remain during the summer; similar\r\n     precaution should be taken with meal or other corn-products during\r\n     the hot months.\r\n\r\nOver a large area of the United States corn-bread is an article of daily\r\ndiet with a great majority of the inhabitants, and its wholesomeness as\r\ncompared with other breads becomes, therefore, an important question.\r\nUnfortunately, corn-meal does not lend itself to the preparation of a dry\r\nbread having sufficient consistency to require chewing. It is true that\r\nthe crusts of the bread made from this grain answer these requirements\r\nfairly well, and there is therefore no reason why this part of it should\r\nnot be used to any extent, provided it be prepared from good meal. We\r\nshould endeavor to cook thin pones of the bread rather than the thicker\r\nones so common in the south. The objection that corn-bread can only be\r\nmasticated with difficulty applies to the other preparations of this\r\ncereal, such as egg-bread, muffins, etc., and they are not, therefore,\r\nwith the exception of the crusts, to be looked upon as being the best\r\nform of bread. Corn-cakes, like all batter-bread, are to be mentioned\r\nonly to be condemned. Grits and hominy are soft and moist and cannot be\r\nproperly chewed, and are, therefore, not to be recommended as good\r\nbreads. Corn-starch preparations are likewise entirely lacking in the\r\nelements required to make good bread, and should only be used\r\noccasionally and in small amounts.\r\n\r\n_Disadvantages of Potatoes._--Irish potatoes are eaten almost as commonly\r\nin some portions of the United States as are corn-products in others, and\r\ntherefore deserve the careful consideration of the hygienist. While it is\r\nnot believed that, like the latter, potatoes give rise to any definite\r\ndisease, it is unfortunately true that they are theoretically worse\r\nbreads than those made from the grain just referred to. In whatever way\r\ncooked, they are moist and require no chewing, and as a consequence many\r\npersons with delicate digestions do not assimilate them properly.\r\n\r\n_Arrowroot._--The preparations of arrowroot are considered digestible,\r\nthough here again we find that such articles of diet are generally moist\r\nand of not proper consistence to be chewed, and they are, therefore, not\r\nas valuable as are breads made from wheaten flour.\r\n\r\n_Rice._--Rice is used by a large portion of the world's inhabitants. When\r\ncooked thoroughly and very dry, it is perhaps almost as good bread as is\r\nthat made from wheat. The starch granules of the former, like those of\r\narrowroot, are somewhat smaller than those of wheat.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to keep rice-flour in good condition, and if it could\r\nbe made into light-bread, it is likely that it would be superior to\r\nwheaten flour, but this does not appear feasible.\r\n\r\nA peculiar and very fatal disease prevails in the East, known as \"kak-ke\"\r\nor \"beri-beri,\" which is now generally regarded as being the result of\r\neating decomposed rice. The writer has seen one or two examples of what\r\nhe considers American beri-beri, but as our rice-eating population is\r\nsmall, it is not likely that this disease will ever become a serious\r\nproblem in the United States.\r\n\r\n_Cereals or Breakfast-foods._--Lastly we will consider the so-called\r\nbreakfast-foods, which are neither more nor less than various\r\npreparations of the different varieties of starch. They are generally\r\nmade from oats or corn-starch. They are nothing more than bread, and as\r\nsome of them have been put through a sort of fermentation it is difficult\r\nto understand how they could be regarded as being quite as wholesome as\r\nthe original products from which they were made. This, however, is not\r\nthe principal objection to them. The real trouble lies in the fact that\r\nthey are, in the majority of instances, served with cream and sugar. When\r\nwe remember what has already been said about starches that are soft and\r\ncannot be chewed, and of the ill effects of sweets on persons who have\r\nany inclination towards dyspepsia, it will be seen that these foods are\r\nnot to be regarded as being wholesome. The real reason that would appear\r\nto explain the coming into existence of these preparations is that they\r\nare mixed with cream and sugar, which appeals strongly to the\r\n\"sweet-tooth\" of the average person. They are nothing but bread, and very\r\nbad bread at that. The remarks made concerning breakfast-foods apply with\r\nequal force to oatmeal, which, as generally used, has the additional\r\ndisadvantage of containing particles of husk.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this discussion on starchy foods the writer desires\r\nparticularly to call attention to a very common error in the way they are\r\neaten. Mention has already been made of the fact that fats after being\r\nmelted are by no means so wholesome as in their natural state, and\r\nproduce, when heated with starches, a very indigestible mixture. Thus,\r\ntheoretically, it is bad to use any great amount of lard, butter or other\r\nfat in the preparation of breads, and it is likewise undesirable to\r\nspread butter on heated breads, as is so often done just before eating\r\nbiscuits, waffles and batter-cakes. The combination is certainly a\r\nseductive one, and pleasing to the taste of most persons, but this in no\r\nway invalidates the fact that the mixture is exceedingly indigestible.\r\n\r\n_Pastries and Cakes._--Peculiarly unwholesome are pastries containing any\r\nconsiderable proportion of fat, and also most varieties of cake. With the\r\nexception possibly of hot batter-cakes served with an abundance of butter\r\nand syrup, cooks have so far produced no compound so heinous and totally\r\ndepraved as pound-cake. Fruit-cake also stands high up in the list of\r\nundesirable sweets. It certainly passes all understanding why cooks\r\nshould continue to persecute the stomachs of a dependent world with such\r\nhighly obnoxious concoctions; the only excuse that can be given for them\r\nis that the mixtures are palatable. Where a housekeeper feels it\r\nnecessary to prepare cake, she should select some receipt free from\r\nbutter or other fat, such as angel-cake or sponge-cake, both of which\r\nwhen properly made are exceedingly good to the taste, and lack the\r\nundesirable quality of containing fats. Explanation for the peculiarly\r\nunwholesome character of food containing melted grease lies probably in\r\nthe fact that the grains of starch under such circumstances must be to a\r\ngreater or less extent covered by a thin layer of the fatty substances,\r\nand as a consequence it is impossible for the saliva to penetrate to the\r\nstarch and perform its normal digestive function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nMEATS, SUGARS AND MILK\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst in the list of foods the writer would place those nitrogenous\r\nsubstances commonly eaten that belong to the class of albumins. That\r\nthese substances are in reality the most important of all food-stuffs\r\nthere can be no sort of question, since they, of all things eaten by the\r\nhuman being, are alone absolutely essential for his well being and even\r\nhis existence. They are the substances that almost exclusively go to make\r\nup the muscle and tendons. Along with the lime-salts they enter largely\r\ninto the composition of the bones and cartilages, brain, spinal cord and\r\nnerves. Other foods are incapable of taking the place of the albumins, so\r\nthat they are absolutely essential for normal life in the human being.\r\n\r\nThe amount of albumin necessary for the normal adult has been variously\r\nestimated, the tendency at the present time being to place the quantity\r\nneeded somewhat lower than was at one time done. It is probable that\r\nabout two ounces of pure albumins is somewhere near the amount required\r\nin twenty-four hours by a normal adult.\r\n\r\nIt is well, since we are so dependent on foods of this class, that we\r\nhave two quite distinct sources from which they may be taken. The great\r\nbulk comes to us in the form of meats, including poultry, game, oysters\r\nand fish of various kinds, in addition to beef, mutton, and hog-meat in\r\nits several forms. Of animal origin also we have eggs, which are among\r\nthe most valuable of all foods of this class on account of their high\r\ndigestibility.\r\n\r\nFrom the vegetable world we get albumins known as legumins, which differ\r\nsomewhat from those obtained from animal sources, though taking their\r\nplace in the economy in all essential particulars. Unfortunately the\r\nlegumins are usually so mixed with starches and other vegetable\r\nsubstances less digestible, that it is necessary to take a large bulk of\r\nfoods of this latter class in order to secure anything like the requisite\r\namount of the former.\r\n\r\nBefore taking up individually the various albuminous foods, the writer\r\nwould again direct attention to the chapter on cooking, and would\r\nstrongly urge upon the reader the proper methods of preparing nitrogenous\r\nfoods therein stated. Where the albumins are in a nearly pure state, as\r\nin milk and eggs, they are slightly more digestible when raw, but all\r\nmeats should be cooked until only the faintest tinge of red remains if we\r\nwish to have them prepared in the most wholesome way for those with\r\ndelicate digestions. Meats are, as a rule, most wholesome when cooked\r\n\"very done.\"\r\n\r\n     It has long been the cry of sentimentalists that no living being\r\n     should die in order that man might exist. Unfortunately for such\r\n     theories, the stern and unbending edict of nature has negatived\r\n     views of this kind ages before the altruistic philosopher came on\r\n     the scene, and we are daily constrained to bow to this mandate of\r\n     one of the primal laws of existence. However much we might desire\r\n     it otherwise, it has been written that \"only in death is there\r\n     life;\" nor may any animal being disobey and continue to exist. As\r\n     has been already explained, the human being cannot thrive on\r\n     vegetable substances alone; from them he may get a certain amount\r\n     of nitrogen in the form of legumin, but there is not enough to\r\n     make up for the waste of this substance that constantly goes on in\r\n     the body.\r\n\r\nTheoretically it is of very little importance which of the meats are\r\nselected to supply our nitrogenous food, but it is unfortunately true\r\nthat such foods vary much in digestibility, and it will therefore be\r\nnecessary to consider them separately.\r\n\r\n_Beef._--When tender and cooked to a proper degree, beef is considered\r\none of our most wholesome of meats. Like other foods of this kind, it\r\nshould not be fried, but should be broiled or roasted, and a certain\r\namount of fat may be eaten along with the lean portions without injury,\r\nand in many persons unquestionably with benefit.\r\n\r\n_Mutton._--Of all the coarser meats, mutton is unquestionably the most\r\ndigestible, and when cooked in the same way as directed for beef is\r\neminently wholesome.\r\n\r\n_Hog-meats._--On account of the large portion of fat between the\r\nmuscle-fibers, hog-meat, particularly when fresh, is not usually regarded\r\nas being digestible. Some persons eat it with impunity, but for the vast\r\nmajority it should be taken only in small quantities. It should not be\r\nfried. In the form of ham, hog meat is more wholesome than when fresh,\r\nbut even in this condition many dyspeptics find much difficulty in\r\ndigesting it. The best method of cooking it is to boil thoroughly. After\r\nbeing cooked in this way and then broiled, it is most appetizing, and is\r\nmuch more wholesome than when broiled without being previously cooked. As\r\nbacon, hog-meat enters largely into the dietary of a great portion of the\r\nlaborers of this country, and there can be no doubt that on the whole it\r\nanswers the purpose of a staple food admirably. It contains even more fat\r\nthan nitrogenous substances, and may therefore be looked upon as a\r\nmixture of butter and meat. Dyspeptics cannot eat it with impunity in\r\nmany instances, though it agrees far better with them than does ham or\r\nthe fresh meat. If it were generally eaten boiled it would provoke less\r\ntrouble than when fried. At this point the writer would repeat his\r\nwarning concerning the indigestible character of melted grease, of which\r\nthe gravy from bacon is a striking example.\r\n\r\nWhen \"cured\" in a somewhat different way hog-meat as \"breakfast-bacon\"\r\nis very generally used throughout the civilized world, and is one of its\r\nmost wholesome forms. This when broiled is both appetizing and wholesome,\r\nand should form a part of the daily dietary of everyone able to afford\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Poultry and Game._--Among the more delicate and most wholesome forms in\r\nwhich albumins are taken we find poultry and game well up toward the head\r\nof the list. Meats of this character should be very thoroughly cooked by\r\nbeing either baked, smothered or broiled.\r\n\r\n_Fish._--Fish of almost all kinds are wholesome provided they be fresh\r\nand properly cooked. The culinary artist prepares of them most appetizing\r\nand nutritious dishes, and they are therefore properly to be recommended\r\nas among the best of the albuminous foods.\r\n\r\n_Oysters and Clams._--Oysters and clams are usually considered somewhat\r\napart from the generality of the foods of this character. When fresh they\r\nare wholesome and delicious when eaten raw, and may be cooked in a great\r\nvariety of ways. The reader should be especially warned that fried\r\noysters are not so wholesome as when they are prepared by other methods,\r\nfor the reason that they are surrounded by a batter containing quantities\r\nof melted grease.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--Among the most delicate, digestible, and nutritious of all foods\r\nwe may place eggs. Though somewhat more digestible when raw, they agree,\r\nas a rule, even with the most fastidious stomach, however cooked, even\r\nwhen hard-boiled. Eggs lend themselves readily to the formation of many\r\ndelicious dishes, such as omelets, soufflés, etc.; but unfortunately they\r\ndo not contain nutriment in a very concentrated form, and where an adult\r\nis living on them alone it requires from one and a half to two dozen\r\ndaily to furnish the necessary amount of food.\r\n\r\n_Fats._--Under the term \"fats\" are included all oily substances, such as\r\nbutter, lard, olive and cotton-seed oils, and to a great extent the fat\r\ncontained in meats. These substances are closely related to starches and\r\nsugars, and undoubtedly play a more or less similar rôle when taken into\r\nthe body as food. From the standpoint of heat-producing capacity they\r\nmore than double, weight for weight, meats and starches, and are,\r\ntherefore, instinctively highly prized by dwellers in cold countries\r\nwhere much heat is necessary. In warmer countries the necessity for\r\nexcessive heat-production in the body does not exist.\r\n\r\n     While oily substances are certainly capable of adding to the\r\n     cushion of fat commonly found beneath the skin in normal\r\n     individuals, they are not looked upon as being to any extent\r\n     tissue-builders, resembling in this particular the starches and\r\n     sugars.\r\n\r\n     When fats are to be eaten, care should be taken that they be as\r\n     fresh as possible, or, if this is not feasible, they should be\r\n     preserved in such a way as to prevent their becoming rancid--a\r\n     condition which is the result of the formation of fatty acids,\r\n     lending a peculiarly unpleasant odor and taste, and producing a\r\n     decided decrease in food-value. This alteration may be largely\r\n     prevented by keeping fats in a refrigerator at a low temperature,\r\n     and may also be greatly retarded by the addition of salt. In this\r\n     country butter is usually treated with a very considerable amount\r\n     of salt, but in Europe it is universally served fresh. Within\r\n     recent years facts have been established that show that Americans\r\n     use an excessive amount of this substance--possibly causing disease\r\n     in some cases; and doubtless we would be better off if we were to\r\n     follow the European practice.\r\n\r\n     Oily substances when in good condition are certainly of high value\r\n     as foods, but should be taken more or less with an eye to the\r\n     climate, and to the season of the year. When placed on cold bread\r\n     and eaten along with it they are extremely palatable, and may be\r\n     taken in reasonable amounts with decided benefit to the whole body.\r\n     In temperate climates it is generally estimated that about three\r\n     ounces is a desirable amount for the average adult. In this\r\n     connection it may not be out of place to mention that the various\r\n     preparations of cod-liver oil, advertised so freely in the lay\r\n     press, in some instances actually do not contain a single particle\r\n     of the substance that they are supposed to be principally composed\r\n     of; and it may be further stated that there is no good reason to\r\n     believe that bulk for bulk oils of this kind are in any way\r\n     superior to those fats commonly eaten. The writer often recalls the\r\n     saying of a very wise old physician of his acquaintance that\r\n     \"cod-liver oil is nearly as good as butter.\"\r\n\r\n_Sugars._--This term includes the large number of different substances of\r\na more or less sweetish taste that belong to the group of carbohydrates.\r\nThey are closely related to the starches, and it is generally assumed\r\nthat they play much the same part after being taken into the body. Some\r\nof these are of animal and some of vegetable origin--but except the sugar\r\nfound in milk, the only ones commonly consumed are those derived from\r\ncane, beets, and fruits; the sugar from the first two is known as cane\r\nsugar or dextrose, and that from the latter as grape sugar or glucose.\r\nLike albumins they may be eaten without having been previously cooked,\r\nand are unique in that they undergo no chemical change whatever as a\r\nresult of ordinary degrees of heat.\r\n\r\nWhile the consumption of sugars in all civilized nations is rapidly\r\nincreasing, there can be no question that, irrespective of fruits, they\r\nare, of all foods, the most frequent causes of digestive disturbances. It\r\nis only within comparatively recent times that mankind has possessed\r\nmeans of separating sugars in any great bulk from the plants containing\r\nthem, and as a consequence they have only entered prominently into our\r\nevery-day diet for a relatively short period of time. Before this, it is\r\ntrue, they were consumed to a greater or less extent in various fruits,\r\nbut the quantity was insignificant as compared with the amount now\r\nuniversally eaten. As a result of this we are now confronted with a new\r\ndietetic problem. For ages the human stomach has been accustomed to deal\r\nwith only small quantities of these substances, and developed\r\naccordingly a capacity to digest them proportionate to the amounts then\r\neaten. Now, however, we constantly call upon our digestive organs to deal\r\nwith large quantities of such foods, and it is not strange that there has\r\nbeen more or less rebellion on their part.\r\n\r\n     Experiments have shown that a small amount of sugar assists in the\r\n     normal chemical changes that go on in the body, and it is,\r\n     therefore, obvious that nature intends us to take a certain\r\n     quantity of it. Moreover it is true that sugars while being burned\r\n     in the body give off much energy--mainly manifested in muscular\r\n     power; where then we are taking active physical exercise foods of\r\n     this kind are peculiarly appropriate. It would, therefore, not be\r\n     wise for us to leave this food entirely out of the dietetic list,\r\n     but to use it only in small amounts--particularly where we lead\r\n     sedentary lives. Sugar and alcohol play a more or less similar rôle\r\n     in the animal economy. It is well known that those who do not use\r\n     alcohol are peculiarly prone to consume considerable quantities of\r\n     sugar; and it is equally a matter of common observation that those\r\n     who habitually take alcohol rarely eat sweets to any extent.\r\n\r\n     When sugar is properly assimilated, as seems to be done most easily\r\n     by children, it is an excellent food, but where sweets are\r\n     over-eaten, and not properly digested, they give rise to a great\r\n     accumulation of gas in the intestine, and produce in many persons\r\n     a marked acidity of the stomach, frequently accompanied by severe\r\n     insomnia. Nothing so quickly relieves such sleeplessness, caused by\r\n     a \"sour stomach,\" as allowing ten or fifteen grains of ordinary\r\n     cooking-soda to slowly dissolve in the mouth and swallowing the\r\n     saliva rendered alkaline in this way.\r\n\r\n_Milk._--Milk may be looked upon as an ideal food, it being composed of\r\nwater carrying in solution the three great natural foods--albumins in the\r\nform of casein, carbohydrates as milk-sugar or lactose, and fat. Mixed in\r\nthe proportion in which they here occur, they are most admirably adapted\r\nto the delicate digestive apparatus of the infant--the relative\r\nproportion of the different substances even gradually changing as the\r\nassimilative powers of the youthful organism increase; it is thus seen\r\nthat milk itself is not of constant composition, even in the same animal,\r\nand that it alters in such a manner as to meet best the needs of the\r\ndelicate being depending upon it for proper sustenance. It is also the\r\ncase that the composition of milk varies in different animals--showing\r\nagain how admirably nature exerts its powers in meeting desired ends.\r\n\r\nThe lesson of practicable importance that we learn from this is that the\r\nmilk of one of the lower animals is not in its natural state quite suited\r\nto the delicate stomach of the growing infant, and that if it be\r\nsubstituted for the mother's milk it must be more or less altered,\r\ndepending upon the age of the child. It is particularly important that\r\nsweet milk be taken slowly, as otherwise large curds, difficult of\r\ndigestion, form as soon as it gets into the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nFOOD-VALUE OF VEGETABLES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recent times we hear much of vegetarianism, which has its advocates\r\namong many highly intelligent people, and which, as a consequence, has\r\nachieved a certain vogue throughout the civilized world. It is rarely the\r\ncase, however, that those who affect to practice this cult in reality\r\nlive exclusively on a vegetable diet. As a rule it will be found that\r\nthey are milk-drinkers, and not infrequently add eggs to their dietary.\r\nIt is, of course, absurd to regard as vegetarians those who simply avoid\r\nmeat, since it is true that the nitrogenous substances contained in milk\r\nand eggs differ in no essential particular from similar substances found\r\nin flesh of all kinds.\r\n\r\nExperiments on a somewhat extended scale have shown within recent years\r\nthat young and vigorous individuals at least may live and thrive on a\r\ndiet composed largely of vegetables; no one has yet shown that a strict\r\nvegetable diet is that best adapted to the average individual, and no\r\ncompetent authority on this subject at the present time advocates a diet\r\npurely of this kind. It is true that the vegetables ordinarily eaten\r\ncontain all of the elements that are essential to the animal system, such\r\nas starch, sugar, fat and albumins. Unfortunately, however, the amount of\r\nthe last-named substance is usually so small in food-plants that the\r\nquantity that would have to be eaten by a normal individual taking active\r\nexercise would cost considerably more than if a reasonable proportion of\r\nanimal food were included, and--which is of even greater importance--the\r\ndigestive powers of the individual who attempted to live only on food of\r\nthis character would be severely taxed, and, in the long run, probably\r\nseriously impaired. Furthermore, vegetables and fruits contain\r\nsubstances, usually in great quantity, that are scarcely acted upon at\r\nall by the digestive juices. Chief among the latter is cellulose, which,\r\nwhile forming the great bulk of the food of herbivorous animals, is\r\nscarcely suited to the weaker digestive capacity of the human being;\r\npractically none of it is converted to the uses of the body. It is thus\r\nseen that in the average man or woman a dietary consisting largely of\r\nvegetables would result in the presence in the intestines of a greater or\r\nless bulk of indigestible materials, which could subserve no good purpose\r\nother than that they would by their mechanical presence have a tendency\r\nto cause the bowels to act; as is the case with fruits, however, it is\r\nunfortunately true that this large residue of undigested food, in one way\r\nor another, often gives rise to considerable irritation of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the intestine, and frequently produces dyspeptic\r\ndisturbances, among which looseness of the bowels is common.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to a consideration of the digestibility of vegetables in\r\ngeneral, which is always the paramount consideration when dealing with\r\nthe value of any substance to be used as a food. It has been before\r\nremarked that young and vigorous persons seem to thrive on a dietary\r\nlargely of vegetable character, but the case is certainly quite different\r\nwith older people, particularly where their digestive powers are\r\nimpaired. In the latter we often find that severe intestinal disturbances\r\nfollow even after moderate indulgence in vegetable foods--particularly\r\nwhere they are served with vinegar, or some other fruit acid. Another\r\npeculiarity of foods of this kind that makes decidedly against their\r\ndigestibility lies in the fact that, being soft and containing a large\r\nproportion of water, they are scarcely ever properly chewed, and as a\r\nconsequence they are swallowed in comparatively large masses without\r\nhaving been adequately insalivated.\r\n\r\nVegetables may be roughly classified as legumes, roots and tubers, and\r\ngreen vegetables, and will now be considered briefly in the order named.\r\n\r\n_Legumes,--Beans, Peas, Lentils, and Peanuts._--With the exception of the\r\ncereals, the legumes are the most valuable of all vegetable foods. Their\r\nnutritious properties are mainly due to their relatively high percentage\r\nof nitrogenous material, though they also contain starch and fat. Hence\r\nthese vegetables contain the ingredients necessary to supply all the\r\nneeds of the human economy; unfortunately, however, when eaten alone in\r\nsufficient bulk to furnish the nourishment required, they often--even in\r\nhealthy individuals--give rise after a little time to dyspeptic\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\nOf beans, a large number of different varieties are in common use\r\nincluding string-beans (or snap-beans), lima-beans, kidney-beans, red\r\nbeans, the frijole, and the Soya bean. String-beans are exceedingly\r\npalatable, and are very much prized as an article of diet by the peoples\r\nof all countries. When gathered young and thoroughly cooked while still\r\nfresh they are exceedingly wholesome, and are very well assimilated, when\r\nproperly chewed, by even those whose digestions are considerably\r\nimpaired. The other beans named are generally eaten dry after having been\r\nremoved from the pod in which they grow. When they are soaked in water\r\nuntil they become soft and then thoroughly cooked they make an excellent\r\nfood, and, when not taken in too great quantities, are fairly digestible.\r\nWhen cooked with onions, parsley, and red pepper in proper proportions\r\nthey make a very delicious dish. In Japan the Soya bean forms the basis\r\nfor a kind of vegetable cheese which is eaten with rice, and furnishes\r\nthe nitrogenous materials in which the latter is deficient. Peas are\r\nwholesome when young and fresh and when properly cooked, and as they come\r\non in the early spring when other fresh vegetables cannot be obtained,\r\nthey furnish a most acceptable addition to the dietary. When old, after\r\ntheir skins become tough, they cease to be digestible, and should not be\r\neaten except in the form of purees, during the preparation of which the\r\nhull is removed.\r\n\r\nLentils are scarcely eaten at all in America, but are much prized in some\r\nportions of the Old World, as the basis of soups.\r\n\r\nPeanuts belong to the group of legumes, though, unlike the others that\r\nserve as food, they grow beneath the surface of the ground. They are\r\nhighly nutritious, but are, unfortunately, indigestible, owing largely to\r\nthe high percentage of oil that they contain. The latter is extracted,\r\nand is sometimes sold as olive-oil; in a somewhat different form it is\r\nmade into a sort of butter which is quite palatable.\r\n\r\n_Roots, Tubers, and Yams._--Sweet and Irish potatoes, which constitute\r\nthe most important members of this group, have already been discussed\r\nunder the head of breads. Of those that remain, some few, as beets and\r\nartichokes, may be regarded as related to those just referred to, while\r\nothers, such as carrots, turnips, radishes, parsnips, etc., are generally\r\nreckoned among the succulent tubers on account of the large proportion of\r\njuice that they contain. Irrespective of the beet, which furnishes a\r\nconsiderable portion of the sugar of commerce, none of them may be looked\r\nupon as foods of a very important character, as they contain only\r\nrelatively small proportions of sugars, starches, and nitrogenous\r\nmaterials. Beets, however, do contain a very high percentage of that\r\nwhich makes potatoes so popular,--about eighty-five per cent. of starches\r\nand sugars, with only a trifle of nitrogenous material. When young and\r\ntender they are often eaten as a salad, either alone or mixed with other\r\nvegetables, and are generally regarded as being wholesome and highly\r\nnutritious. They should not be eaten by dyspeptics when pickled, on\r\naccount of the vinegar.\r\n\r\nArtichokes are occasionally eaten, but are not nutritious, although they\r\nagree well with many persons.\r\n\r\nCarrots, when young and fresh, are fairly digestible, but like other\r\nvegetables are exceedingly apt, particularly if old, to produce\r\nintestinal disturbances in dyspeptics. They are not very commonly eaten\r\nin the United States, but where selected with care we would profit by\r\ntheir more frequent use. They contain a small percentage of starches,\r\nwith an insignificant proportion of vegetable albumin.\r\n\r\nTurnips are exceedingly unwholesome, contain very little nourishment, and\r\nmay be eaten with impunity only by persons in vigorous health. The same\r\nremarks apply to radishes, and to parsnips.\r\n\r\n_Green Vegetables._--Vegetables of this class are of much more value from\r\nthe standpoint of their agreeable taste, and the consequent stimulating\r\neffect upon the appetite, than from the nutritive materials that they\r\ncontain. Some of them are eaten cooked, while others are usually consumed\r\nin a raw state. They are all much less indigestible if eaten when quite\r\nyoung and fresh--drying seemingly having the effect of producing\r\nalterations in them that predispose to dyspeptic disturbances in those so\r\ninclined.\r\n\r\nSpinach is one of the most digestible of the entire group, and is much\r\neaten in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nTurnip-tops differ in no essential particular from spinach. They have a\r\nsomewhat bitter taste, but when young and fresh are highly palatable, and\r\nif thoroughly cooked cause comparatively little intestinal trouble, but\r\nlike spinach they contain practically no nourishment. The same may be\r\nsaid of the leaves of various other plants commonly served as greens,\r\namong them beet-tops, and dandelion-tops.\r\n\r\nCabbages, many different kinds of which are habitually eaten as food in\r\ncivilized countries, have comparatively little nutritive value, and are,\r\ngenerally speaking, decidedly indigestible, although young and vigorous\r\npersons, particularly where they take abundant out-door exercise, find no\r\ndifficulty in assimilating the inner portions of the fresh cabbage\r\n\"head.\" As in the case with other vegetables, the soil and locality in\r\nwhich the cabbage is grown largely influences its taste, and to some\r\nextent its digestibility. It should never be given to infants. Sauerkraut\r\nis a preparation of cabbage leaves produced by adding salt, and later\r\ncrushing them with considerable pressure; after a time alterations occur\r\nof a fermentative character, and the product is generally regarded as\r\nmore wholesome than fresh cabbage.\r\n\r\nCauliflower consists of masses of the somewhat modified flowers of a\r\nplant closely related to the cabbage, and is, when properly prepared,\r\npalatable, and perhaps somewhat more digestible than cabbage. Cole, and\r\nBrussels sprouts, are plants of the cabbage family, and are perhaps even\r\nmore indigestible.\r\n\r\n_Salad Plants._--The leaves of the lettuce are usually eaten raw, most\r\ncommonly being served as a salad in combination with oil and vinegar, or\r\nlemon juice. That the leaves possess, when treated in this way, a very\r\npalatable taste all will perhaps agree, but they cannot be said to be of\r\nany nutritive value, nor are the acids just referred to conducive to\r\ntheir digestibility.\r\n\r\nOn account of their somewhat pungent taste, watercresses are used in many\r\nparts of the world as ingredients of salads, but they are, of all\r\nvegetables, the ones that are most liable to transmit disease to man, for\r\nin addition to the possibility of contracting in this way typhoid fever,\r\ndysentery, cholera, and the ordinary intestinal worms, the human being is\r\napt to receive with them the eggs of the flukes, and the spores of the\r\namoebæ that produce chronic tropical dysentery. As they are probably\r\nnever grown under such conditions as to preclude the possibility of this\r\ndanger, it would be the part of wisdom to absolutely refrain from their\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n_Onions, Leeks, Shallots, and Garlic._--Vegetables of this group are\r\neaten either raw or cooked, and of all those consumed in the former state\r\nare least liable to transmit disease, owing to the fact that they are\r\nnearly always thoroughly peeled before being eaten. They have the\r\nadvantage, furthermore, that they may be preserved for long periods of\r\ntime in such a way as to be fit for food, and when properly cooked have a\r\ndelicate flavor, and are quite wholesome although furnishing little food\r\nfor the body. Garlic is never eaten as a vegetable, but serves as the\r\nbasis for many of the delicate sauces for which the French cooks are so\r\njustly celebrated.\r\n\r\nThe tomato has been used as a food only within comparatively recent\r\ntimes, it having been formerly thought to be poisonous. Like the onion it\r\nmay be eaten either raw or cooked, and if taken in moderation does not,\r\nas a rule, produce any serious harm. When eaten in greater quantities,\r\nboth on account of the acid that it contains and its relatively small\r\nproportion of assimilable nutriment, the tomato is exceedingly prone to\r\ncause intestinal disturbances, and should rather be regarded as a fruit\r\nthan a vegetable. Growing at some distance from the ground, it is rather\r\nless apt to convey diseases than the majority of vegetables eaten in a\r\nraw state.\r\n\r\nWhile celery is generally eaten raw, it furnishes a palatable dish when\r\ncooked in milk. It should not be eaten by dyspeptics or children,\r\nparticularly if raw. Similarly the cucumber has a well-merited reputation\r\nfor producing dyspeptic disturbances. It is only eaten raw, is frequently\r\nserved as a salad, and should be used only when very young and fresh,\r\nand eaten only by persons of sound digestion.\r\n\r\nOkra is much prized in the Southern States as the principal ingredient of\r\na very palatable soup, but is not as a rule looked upon with favor by the\r\nuninitiated. It is also much eaten boiled and served with a little butter\r\nand pepper. When fresh and young it is fairly digestible, and furnishes a\r\nvery agreeable addition to the dinner.\r\n\r\n     In addition to those already referred to, there are a number of\r\n     vegetables that are very popular either alone, or in combination as\r\n     salads--particularly in the South; among them are green peppers,\r\n     parsley, mint, capers, endive, and chicory. The remarks already\r\n     made concerning green vegetables apply equally to these just\r\n     mentioned, and it should here again be particularly insisted upon\r\n     that salads containing acids are unwholesome for infants and\r\n     children, and should be used sparingly even by those in health.\r\n     None contains much nourishment.\r\n\r\n     Among easily digestible vegetables asparagus probably takes front\r\n     rank, and in addition to this has the merit of being exceedingly\r\n     agreeable to the taste. It possesses little nutritive value, but\r\n     when young, fresh, and well cooked, it may be taken even by infants\r\n     without harm.\r\n\r\n     Rhubarb, or \"pie plant,\" is eaten stewed, and made into pie. It is\r\n     said to be somewhat laxative, and is decidedly more wholesome than\r\n     many others. The squash, when properly cooked is comparatively\r\n     wholesome, but contains little nourishment, and is of no particular\r\n     value as a food, and the pumpkin is not much better, although\r\n     useful during the winter for making pies after the ordinary\r\n     vegetables and fruits are gone.\r\n\r\n     Cranberries, when thoroughly cooked and separated from the hulls,\r\n     form the basis of a delicious jelly that is widely eaten in the\r\n     winter over all portions of the United States. Like all sweets it\r\n     is not entirely wholesome for dyspeptics or infants, but as it is\r\n     usually eaten with meats and not in great quantities, it may be\r\n     looked upon as being one of the most wholesome of all foods of this\r\n     class. It does not seem to have such a tendency to produce sour\r\n     stomach in many dyspeptics as is so frequently done by other foods\r\n     containing vegetable acids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nDANGER IN FRUITS AND PICKLES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an error shared almost universally by both medical men and the\r\nlaity that fruits and raw foods are wholesome. Everyone is familiar with\r\nthe fact that fruits produce intestinal disturbances in children,--not\r\nonly when they are very young, but after their digestive apparatus is\r\nfully developed. Rather curiously, however, instead of ascribing the\r\ndisturbances that follow to the real cause, we generally dismiss the\r\nmatter with the assertion that \"early fruits are unhealthy,\" or trace the\r\nresulting ill effects to some other equally imaginary factor. In reality\r\nthe reason why diarrhoea and other intestinal troubles so often occur\r\nafter eating fruits in the early spring is that the boy or girl after a\r\nwinter's fast greedily devours enormous quantities of them when they\r\nfirst ripen, and disturbances follow in proportion to the amount and\r\ncharacter of these substances taken.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that fruits, while extremely palatable, usually\r\nproduce trouble in dyspeptics, and even in those who still possess\r\nunimpaired digestive organs ill effects quite constantly follow on the\r\nheels of the taking of food of this character. Unfortunately, however,\r\nthe great majority of dyspeptics have symptoms that in no way outwardly\r\npoint toward digestive errors; as common examples, we might refer to the\r\nblackheads, pimples and small boils, so frequently observed on the faces\r\nof young boys and girls, or the rheumatic pains, and, at a later time,\r\nthe \"Bright's disease,\" that occur in older people. When you tell such\r\npatients that their trouble is indigestion, they are often mildly\r\nindignant, and loudly protest that they can eat anything with impunity;\r\nthat they never have heart-burn, feelings of heaviness after eating,\r\npains in the abdomen, or other symptoms referable to the stomach and\r\nintestines. We are rather disposed to be proud of our digestive powers,\r\njust as we are of our bodily strength, and nothing is more common than\r\nfor chronic dyspeptics to maintain that they have never had indigestion\r\nin their lives, and to resent any insinuation to the contrary.\r\n\r\nAnother popular error, almost universally accepted, is that fruits are\r\nhighly nutritious; as a matter of fact they consist almost wholly of\r\nwater, and of materials that are utterly indigestible. The latter\r\nsubstances pass through the alimentary tract, therefore, in much the same\r\ncondition that they enter and serve no better purpose than to promote,\r\nsomewhat, activity in the bowels. Nevertheless the writer does not wish\r\nto be misunderstood as advocating total abstinence from such a palatable\r\nclass of foods; no harm results in most people if they only take\r\nperfectly ripe and fresh fruits in moderation now and then; and these\r\nshould be always eaten after meals rather than before.\r\n\r\nThe fruits that contain comparatively little acid are, as a rule, more\r\nwholesome than those that are rich in substance of this kind. For\r\nexample, perfectly fresh and ripe figs or peaches may be taken by most\r\npersons with impunity if they be eaten after meals, and at intervals of\r\nat least two or three days. Acid fruits, particularly lemons, seem to be\r\npeculiarly unwholesome; apples are prone to cause trouble and can rarely\r\nbe eaten without ill effects, however mellow and palatable they may be.\r\nIt sometimes happens that persons take grape-fruit with less harm than\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nClosely akin to fruits in their deleterious action on the digestive\r\napparatus are sours in any form whatever. Women, especially, indulge\r\nfreely and at irregular hours in foods containing much vinegar,\r\nlemon-juice, etc.,--usually in the form of pickles or salads. In healthy\r\npersons, in moderation, foods of this character perhaps produce no\r\nappreciable trouble, but nothing is more thoroughly established than that\r\nthey act harmfully on the general run of dyspeptics, such as most of us\r\nare to a greater or less degree after thirty years of age. This leads to\r\nthe remark that here, as in everything else, we must regard individual\r\npeculiarities--it being true that one person can eat without ill effects\r\nwhat may produce decided disturbances in others, or suffer from excess\r\nwhen moderation would entail no ill-effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDRINKS--PROPER AND HARMFUL\r\n\r\n\r\nAn immense amount of rubbish has been written during the last few decades\r\nconcerning the supposed good effect of excessive water-drinking on the\r\nhuman economy. Something like a quarter of a century ago a London\r\nphysician by the name of Haig brought forward and strenuously advocated\r\nthe view that a large number of minor ailments were the result of the\r\npresence in the body of excessive quantities of uric acid; applying the\r\nwell known fact that the substance just mentioned requires a large amount\r\nof water to dissolve it he conceived the idea that the proper remedy was\r\nto flood the body with enormous quantities of liquids, and thus, as it\r\nwere, wash the offending substance out of the system. So plausible did he\r\nmake this theory appear that it was accepted very largely by medical men,\r\nwho in turn taught it to the general public. Within recent times it has\r\nbeen fortunately shown that Haig's theory was wholly chimerical, and\r\nthat quantities of uric acid greatly in excess of the normal amount could\r\ncollect in the body, or might be injected into the blood-vessels, without\r\nthe least harm resulting; thus, at one blow, this widely accepted theory\r\nwas annihilated, and there now remains no sort of reason for attempting\r\nto remove uric acid by excessive water-drinking, or by other means.\r\n\r\n     It is fortunate that the uric-acid theory has been disproved, for\r\n     the excessive use of water is not only unnecessary, but highly\r\n     injurious to the digestive organs, particularly when the fluids are\r\n     taken at or about meals. Experience has shown that excessive\r\n     stomach-acidity, which is the most common form of indigestion, is\r\n     in a large degree dependent on the taking of liquids while eating,\r\n     and that even in those who are healthy any more than small\r\n     quantities cannot be looked upon as being wholesome. In dyspeptics\r\n     liquids seem to act in a hurtful way in several different\r\n     directions. For example, where persons constantly take liquids\r\n     while eating the necessity of properly chewing the food is largely\r\n     done away with; in addition to this the mere presence of water in\r\n     the stomach seems to tend to the production of increased acidity,\r\n     for it has often been observed by the writer that even where food\r\n     was eaten dry indigestion would follow in many dyspeptics if they\r\n     took water just before or immediately after eating.\r\n\r\nThe only sensible advice that can be given in this connection is that\r\npersons should take no more liquids that they feel a desire for, and they\r\nshould avoid taking them in any quantity about meal time. What has just\r\nbeen said concerning water applies equally well to milk. When taken alone\r\nit very frequently agrees with patients much better than does solid food,\r\nbut when mixed with the latter is prone to produce indigestion, just as\r\ndoes water. Fermented milk in the form of buttermilk is a very popular\r\nbeverage in some parts of the world, but it may be well doubted as to\r\nwhether it deserves the reputation for wholesomeness generally accorded\r\nit; being a liquid, and at the same time acid, it is peculiarly prone to\r\nincrease acidity, and is not tolerated by persons who suffer with sour\r\nstomach. It should, however, be said that it, on the other hand, seems to\r\nagree particularly well with some people, and has been known when taken\r\nalone, at least temporarily, to relieve obstinate forms of indigestion.\r\n\r\n_Coffee._--The most universal beverage taken at meal time in America is\r\nundoubtedly coffee. Each morning countless thousands are cheered and\r\nstimulated by its invigorating properties to undertake their daily tasks,\r\nbut, as is always the case after taking drugs that have such action the\r\nsystem has to pay the penalty in a reaction following later, during which\r\nthe capacity for work is diminished. It is, however, true that the effect\r\nlast referred to is not of such importance as to constitute in itself a\r\nserious objection to the use of coffee, but other ill results are rather\r\nprone to ensue that in many instances change the aspect of the question\r\nentirely. In a great many people, particularly after the first vigor of\r\nyouth has passed, coffee produces anything but pleasant effects, and on\r\nsome it seems to act as a downright poison. Like all liquids taken at\r\nmeal time, it predisposes to acid indigestion, particularly when it is\r\nsweetened. It is likewise true that when it contains any considerable\r\nquantity of cream the liability to dyspeptic disturbances following its\r\nuse are particularly great--doubtless as a result of the considerable\r\nquantity of melted fats that it contains under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n     From the foregoing it appears then that coffee without either cream\r\n     or sugar is less unwholesome than when these substances are added\r\n     to it, but even when it is taken in this way it causes decided\r\n     symptoms of indigestion in many persons. The writer is not of the\r\n     opinion that the habitual taking of coffee is to be commended, and\r\n     would, therefore, not advise its constant use; it, however, must be\r\n     admitted--as is the case with all other substances that cause\r\n     indigestion--that in many people, and particularly in those who\r\n     live out-of-doors and are actively engaged in physical occupations,\r\n     the use of coffee seems to result in no harm. Like other substances\r\n     that cause indigestion in a concentrated form, coffee when largely\r\n     diluted is less apt to produce disturbances of this kind; for\r\n     example, a beverage consisting of two-thirds of hot skimmed milk\r\n     and one-third coffee may be taken by many dyspeptics in reasonable\r\n     amounts without any particular harm. Parents should be warned\r\n     against allowing growing children to drink coffee; it seriously\r\n     interferes with the normal chemical changes going on in their\r\n     bodies, and is almost certain to be followed in later life by\r\n     nervous dyspepsia.\r\n\r\n_Tea._--The stimulating principle of tea is chemically so nearly like\r\nthat of coffee that they are generally considered as being one and the\r\nsame. That they differ decidedly in their action on the stomach and the\r\nbody generally there can, however, be no doubt. The stimulating action of\r\ntea comes on more slowly than that of coffee, and is correspondingly\r\nprolonged. In most persons it is not so apt to produce nervousness, nor\r\nis its action in preventing sleep so pronounced. On the stomach it also\r\nproduces effects that are diametrically opposed to those induced by\r\ncoffee, since, instead of stimulating, it seems actually to retard the\r\nsecretion of acids. It is, therefore, probably true that we should look\r\nupon tea as a beverage with much less disfavor than we do coffee--though,\r\nof course, it should always be remembered that there may be, and\r\nunquestionably are, many exceptions to this judgment.\r\n\r\n     Probably no other daily article of food or drink is so commonly\r\n     prepared in an improper manner as tea--which is all the more\r\n     curious when we consider that perhaps none other that requires heat\r\n     for its preparation is so easily made. It should be brewed by\r\n     simply pouring boiling water upon the leaves, but the vessel\r\n     containing the decoction should not be placed over the fire while\r\n     the tea is being prepared. Of even greater importance is the\r\n     necessity of allowing the water to remain in contact with the\r\n     leaves only a few moments--_never more than a minute if we wish\r\n     the tea to be good._ The reason for the latter precaution lies in\r\n     the fact that tea-leaves contain a considerable amount of tannic\r\n     acid, and, as the longer the water and leaves remain together the\r\n     more of this substance is extracted from the latter, it is not\r\n     difficult to see that we should be careful to allow only a brief\r\n     contact between the two; the presence of this acid is undesirable,\r\n     not only on account of the fact that it gives to the decoction a\r\n     bitter and unpleasant taste, but because it has a tendency to cause\r\n     digestive disturbances. It is seemingly not generally known that\r\n     there are many varieties of tea, and that some of them are so\r\n     superior in flavor and bouquet to others that they might well be\r\n     entirely different substances. The best of all (in the writer's\r\n     opinion) are those that are composed largely of leaves grown in\r\n     Ceylon, usually mixed with India tea. If we will demand of our\r\n     grocer a first-class Ceylon tea we will find that a beverage may be\r\n     made from it that will appeal quite as much to the palate as a good\r\n     coffee.\r\n\r\n     Before dismissing this subject finally, some reference should be\r\n     made to ice-tea. This beverage is exceedingly palatable when\r\n     properly prepared, and under such circumstances by no means\r\n     deserves the disfavor with which it is regarded by many. The latter\r\n     circumstance is entirely due to two things; first, we find too\r\n     frequently that it is the habit of house-keepers to pour boiling\r\n     water on the leaves when the midday meal is cooked and to allow\r\n     them to soak together until night, and second, the fact that\r\n     lemon-juice is very commonly added to the tea before being drunk.\r\n     The ice that the tea contains has little or nothing to do with the\r\n     dyspeptic disturbances that frequently follow the drinking of cold\r\n     tea. If we will leave out the lemon and pour off the water after it\r\n     has been in contact with the tea leaves for something like a\r\n     minute, it will be discovered that practically all of the ill\r\n     effects usually ascribed to this palatable beverage have been done\r\n     away with.\r\n\r\n_Alcohol._--A discussion of beverages would not be complete without some\r\nmention of those containing alcohol. This at once brings us face to face\r\nwith the bitter controversy on this subject that has been waged so long\r\nthroughout the United States, and which can only be considered here from\r\nthe standpoint of the effects of alcohol on the human economy, and to\r\ndraw corresponding conclusions.\r\n\r\nThat alcohol, even in very small quantities, reduces the general strength\r\nand capacity for work there can be no question, and in addition we find\r\nfrom experiments carefully conducted on the lower animals that the\r\nliability to infection by various disease-producing germs is greatly\r\nincreased by the administration of even minute amounts of the drug. A\r\nman then who is a habitual user of alcoholic drinks not only thereby\r\ndiminishes his capacity to labor effectually, but at the same time\r\nrenders himself more liable to disease. No more striking example of this\r\ncould be brought forward than the well established fact that persons who\r\nuse alcohol are exceedingly prone to consumption--so true is this,\r\nindeed, that we might almost look upon the drug as being practically the\r\ncause of this disease in most instances. Of course the bacillus of\r\ntuberculosis must be present in order for the malady to develop, but we\r\nfind that the alcohol has prepared a soil for the growth of the germ\r\nwhich would not otherwise exist. This holds with equal force as regards\r\nother infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is true that maladies that result from bad digestion and\r\nimproper assimilation are frequently produced by the habitual use of\r\nalcoholic liquors. Gout and Bright's disease are in the vast majority of\r\ncases the indirect off-spring of habitual drinking. It should be\r\nnoted--and the distinction is of importance--that the affections of a\r\ngrave character most frequently produced by the alcoholic habit do not\r\nensue as a consequence of what could be rightly called intemperate taking\r\nof the drug,--its moderate use more commonly resulting in serious disease\r\nthan when it is taken in great excess.\r\n\r\n     The explanation of this probably lies, at least in part, in the\r\n     fact that the majority of drunkards only take alcohol at greater or\r\n     less intervals, and as a consequence the system has time to\r\n     recuperate between sprees. The typical dipsomaniac goes weeks,\r\n     months, and even years without drinking at all, but when he is\r\n     seized by the desire for drink he throws everything else aside and\r\n     spends days and weeks in a prolonged debauch; during this period he\r\n     eats very little, and as a consequence largely avoids the grave\r\n     dyspeptic disturbances that would otherwise inevitably result.\r\n     Alcoholics of this class acquire catarrhal conditions of their\r\n     stomachs, and if seized with some acute disease, like pneumonia,\r\n     during or just after a spree, quickly die in a large proportion of\r\n     cases, but they do not develop gout or Bright's disease as a rule,\r\n     nor do they very commonly become consumptive, as is the case with\r\n     those who take the drug in small quantities day by day.\r\n     Furthermore, it would appear that the grave disorders that so\r\n     frequently follow the long-continued use of alcohol cannot be said\r\n     to be the direct result of the use of the drug, but ensue as a\r\n     consequence of the stimulating action of the alcohol on the\r\n     appetite, leading to over-eating. Under such circumstances\r\n     indigestion follows from excessive over-feeding, and this is added\r\n     to by the naturally irritating effect of the alcohol on the\r\n     stomach. When this is continued through a series of years, the\r\n     assimilating power of the organism gradually deteriorates, and we\r\n     begin to meet with chronic dyspepsia, acute Bright's disease, and\r\n     cirrhosis of the liver. Let no one then consider that he is not\r\n     misusing alcohol for the reason that he only takes a drink before\r\n     meals--it would be far better if he were to go on a moderate spree\r\n     occasionally.\r\n\r\nIn this connection mention should be made of the great evil of patent\r\nmedicines containing, and in reality essentially consisting, of alcohol.\r\nA vast number of them are widely sold under the misleading statement\r\nthat they relieve catarrh, cure diseases of the kidneys, and that\r\nthey act as tonics and general invigorants of the entire system.\r\nMasquerading under one guise or another they are sold to the unsuspecting\r\npublic--prohibitionists for the most part--who fondly imagine that their\r\nglass of \"bitters,\" \"liver-regulator,\" or \"safe cure for the kidneys,\" is\r\nentirely harmless. Let all such be warned that with scarcely an exception\r\npatent medicines of this class are nothing more nor less than poor\r\nwhisky containing some bitter to disguise the taste, and that they are in\r\nfact taking a drink when they use nostrums of this kind. The ultimate\r\neffect of this kind of drinking is to produce serious and grave diseases.\r\n\r\nThis discussion of the effect of alcohol on the human body would not be\r\ncomplete without calling attention to the extraordinary fact that those\r\npeoples to whom we owe our modern civilization have from time immemorial,\r\nmost of all others, consumed the greatest amount of alcohol. Explain it\r\nas we may, the fact remains that the greatest achievements of the world\r\nwere brought about by a society in which a very large proportion of its\r\nmembers were in the habit of more or less constantly taking alcoholic\r\nbeverages. Naturally, the query is forced upon us whether this drug may\r\nnot have played some important part in the great results achieved.\r\nUnfortunately, no one can answer one way or another, but our very\r\nignorance should emphasize the importance of looking at the question from\r\nevery side, and not jumping at conclusions before they are warranted by\r\nfacts. It is true that most of our positive knowledge on this subject\r\nwould condemn alcohol as being the greatest curse of the ages, but it\r\nmay be that it has played a beneficent part in the affairs of mankind\r\nthrough devious paths impossible to trace. Unquestionably a drug, the\r\ntaking of which assists us in momentarily throwing our troubles aside,\r\nmust be of a certain positive value to mankind. If only it possessed\r\nthese good qualities with none of its bad ones!\r\n\r\nHaving considered very briefly the general effects of alcohol on the\r\nsystem a few remarks may be appropriately made concerning the several\r\nbeverages commonly consumed in the United States for which it serves as a\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n_Whisky._--Under the term whisky will here be included all of those\r\nstronger alcoholic beverages that are the product of distillation. In\r\naddition to those commonly designated as such we may reckon brandy, gin,\r\nand rum, and at the same time those subtle combinations called\r\nmixed-drinks, for which they serve as a basis. It will, perhaps, startle\r\nthe average reader when the statement is made that whisky and its near\r\nrelatives just referred to, particularly when diluted by water, are by\r\nfar the least harmful of all alcoholic drinks. Their bad reputation lies\r\nin the fact that on account of their large percentage of alcohol they are\r\nusually preferred by drunkards, and that when consumed in excessive\r\namounts by those unaccustomed to their use there often follow those\r\nfrightful crimes with which these particular forms of alcohol are so\r\nodiously associated. The facts are, however, that when taken in\r\nmoderation they are much less prone to produce indigestion than wines or\r\nmalt liquors, and where one is determined to drink, they should\r\nunquestionably receive the preference. It should not be understood that\r\nthe writer is in any way advocating their use, but the facts of\r\nexperience compel him to state frankly that the least harmful of all\r\nalcoholic beverages is whisky, or its near relatives.\r\n\r\n_Wines._--There are a large number of fermented juices of fruits that are\r\nknown as wines. They are either sweet or acid in taste, and both are\r\npeculiarly prone to induce dyspepsia in persons with delicate stomachs.\r\nIrrespective of their delicate flavor, which, in many instances, appeals\r\nstrongly to the palate, the only virtue that they may be said to possess\r\nis that they contain alcohol in small amounts; this, however, is off-set\r\nentirely by their large percentage of sugars and acids, causing them to\r\nbe much more unwholesome than plain whisky.\r\n\r\n_Beers and Malt Liquors._--It is very fortunate that in those states of\r\nthe American Union that have recently enacted prohibition laws, beer and\r\nother malt liquors are now being widely sold under the plea that they are\r\nnon-intoxicating and that they are in no way unwholesome. While it is\r\ntrue that the former claim is in a measure correct, it is a fact well\r\nunderstood by those who have given the matter study that they are perhaps\r\nthe most unwholesome of all alcoholic beverages. Those in the habit of\r\nusing them are almost universally under the impression that they are\r\nharmless, and as the taste for them is easily cultivated, those who once\r\nacquire the habit are very apt to take them in greater or less quantities\r\ndaily. As a result of this, chronic digestive disturbances are always\r\nsooner or later set up, and the victim in the course of time often\r\nacquires a gouty tendency, which is all the more dangerous for the\r\nreason that in America it scarcely ever manifests itself in acute joint\r\ninflammations. The patient gets into what has been called a \"lithemic\"\r\nstate, which is but another name for gout, and sooner or later is\r\nexceedingly apt to develop a chronic form of Bright's disease. It is\r\ngreatly to be deplored that some of our professional national\r\nschool-masters do not address themselves to this subject rather than to\r\nappealing to the worst passions of the ignorant in attacking the great\r\ninstitutions of our country, and in assailing the fundamental principles\r\nof our government that come down to us as a priceless heritage from the\r\nwise and patriotic statesmen who first brought our nation into life.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the three great classes of alcoholic beverages already\r\nconsidered there are innumerable others, fortunately but little known to\r\nthe general public, and prized only by connoisseurs in such matters. As\r\nwe happily have no problem confronting us in any way similar to the\r\nabsinthe-habit, so common in France, it is not deemed necessary here to\r\ndo more than merely to refer to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF GOOD COOKING\r\n\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to certain misconceptions concerning\r\ncooking diligently circulated in recent years by various quacks. The\r\nvictim is advised that he must take large quantities of raw eggs and\r\nmilk, and at the same time is instructed to eat a number of other\r\nspecially prepared articles furnished at a stiff price and certified as\r\nbeing raw by the \"medical company\" furnishing the \"treatment.\" Since it\r\nis quickly discovered by those who are entrapped by charlatans of this\r\nkind that the only raw foods that they can take with comfort and without\r\ndisgust are milk and eggs, they naturally practically live on these\r\nalone, and as these foods are extremely digestible and nutritious,\r\nimprovement in the patient's condition not uncommonly results.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is unquestionably true that the vast majority of foods\r\nare greatly improved in digestibility, and are rendered much more\r\npalatable by thorough cooking. After being properly cooked there develop\r\nin foods certain flavors and odors that are highly appetizing, and\r\nunquestionably aid in the subsequent digestion of the same. With but few\r\nexceptions, foods are so altered by heat that their proper mastication\r\nbecomes much easier, and cooking, therefore, materially aids in reducing\r\nthem to a state in which they are much more readily acted upon by the\r\ndigestive juices. It should never be forgotten, also, that cooking is of\r\nthe utmost importance from the standpoint of killing bacteria and animal\r\nparasites that may be present in food. If we were to adopt universally\r\nthe habit of eating everything raw, the general mortality would certainly\r\nbe considerably increased.\r\n\r\n_Cooking of Starchy Foods._--Nothing in the whole art and science of\r\npreparing food for the human being is of so much importance as the proper\r\ncooking of starches. As a result of the heat employed, certain chemical\r\nchanges are induced in the starch-granules, as a consequence of which\r\nthey are rendered digestible. It is of fundamental importance that at\r\nall times and under all circumstances the cooking of this class of foods\r\nshould be as thorough as is possible, for when this is not done digestive\r\ndisturbances are sure to follow, and much of the food is actually wasted.\r\nThere are but few cardinal principles in the ordinary hygiene of life\r\nthat are so commonly neglected as this, since it is the habit of a large\r\nproportion of the American people to consume three times a day masses of\r\ntenacious starch which has not been acted upon by heat sufficiently to\r\nrender it digestible.\r\n\r\nOf all the different methods of cooking starches, by far the most common,\r\nand, therefore, the most important, is the process called baking. While\r\nit is not possible in this volume to go into the subject with the\r\nthoroughness that it deserves, the principal points deserve some mention.\r\nThey may be briefly stated as follows:\r\n\r\n     (1) The flour must be made into a dough in which are incorporated\r\n     substances that produce a gas called carbon dioxide, which, forming\r\n     in innumerable small bubbles throughout the mass, cause the whole\r\n     to swell; when this is completed the bread is said to have\r\n     \"risen.\" Of course the object of this is to produce a thorough\r\n     breaking up of the sticky dough--with the result that when the\r\n     bread is finally cooked it is light and fluffy, and can be readily\r\n     masticated.\r\n\r\n     (2) After the process just described has been completed the bread\r\n     should be thoroughly cooked, for reasons which have already been\r\n     explained.\r\n\r\n     (3) After cooking has been accomplished the bread should be\r\n     thoroughly dried, either by keeping it hot until this occurs, or,\r\n     what is better, permitting it to remain warm for a time and then\r\n     allowing the process to be completed in a natural way by putting\r\n     the bread aside for several days. It is necessary for bread to be\r\n     dried in order that it may be thoroughly soaked in saliva during\r\n     the process of chewing.\r\n\r\nIf the principles above enunciated be properly followed out, good\r\nwholesome bread will result. There are, of course, many details connected\r\nwith the preparation of food known to expert cooks into which it will not\r\nbe possible for us to go here, and for which the reader is referred to\r\nany good cook-book.\r\n\r\nSome starchy foods such as rice and potatoes, do not lend themselves\r\nreadily to the production of breads, and are consequently usually cooked\r\nin some other manner. It cannot be too strongly insisted upon that they\r\nshould be rather _steamed_ than boiled,--the process being usually\r\ncarried out by placing a small amount of water with them and allowing it\r\nto boil away; we should remember also that the principles just insisted\r\nupon in connection with making bread apply here with equal force--we\r\nshould cook thoroughly and serve both as dry as is possible.\r\n\r\n_Cooking of Meats._--Here again it is necessary to insist upon the\r\nnecessity of thorough cooking. The error has long prevailed that raw\r\nmeats are wholesome, but within recent years it has been clearly\r\ndemonstrated that this old view is erroneous. The muscle-fibers that\r\nconstitute the bulk of the nourishment of meats are separated from each\r\nother by a substance which cannot be acted upon by the juices of the\r\nstomach until it has been heated to a temperature which results in the\r\ncooking of the entire mass. It is true that the muscular substance proper\r\nmay be digested without heat--resembling in this way the white of the\r\negg, to which it is chemically closely related; by scraping meat with\r\nsome dull instrument the muscle fibers may be separated in a more or\r\nless pure state--leaving the substance that requires heat in order to\r\nbecome digestible behind--and after having been removed in this way, of\r\ncourse, may be eaten in a raw or semi-cooked condition without ill\r\neffects. In preparing meat it is not absolutely essential that it be\r\ncooked until thoroughly \"done\"--a slight tinge of red being allowable.\r\n\r\n_Healthful Recipes._--In an Appendix to this volume will be found a\r\nseries of recipes for the preparation of common foods, for which the\r\nauthor is indebted to Dr. Mary E. Lapham, of Highlands, N. C. They will\r\nbe found extremely practicable for making not only very palatable but\r\nthoroughly wholesome dishes; and are earnestly recommended to young\r\nhousewives, who err through ignorance, as a rule, rather than because of\r\ncarelessness or of lack of good materials. It has often been said that\r\nthe road to a man's heart lies through his stomach. It would not be\r\nsurprising to learn that this aphorism fell first from the lips of some\r\nwise woman who had observed that in a great number of cases unhappiness\r\nin home-life had resulted primarily from lack of home-comfort, and\r\nchiefly from unvaried, unappetizing meals and table-service. Another\r\npoint is well worth remembering, especially by young married women: a man\r\nwhose home is pleasant and comfortable is likely to spend as much of his\r\ntime there as he can--if it is otherwise, he will seek some place that\r\nhas these desirable qualities, such as his club, or an arm-chair in some\r\ncorner saloon. Furthermore, a man who is not only abundantly, but\r\n_nicely_ fed, has far less desire for the stimulants which lead to\r\ndrunkenness, than the man who is denied at home the properly cooked and\r\nseasonably varied food which his system craves. No better work in the\r\n\"Temperance cause\" can be done than to make an attractive home.\r\n\r\nThese are facts which many a young housewife needs to learn and keep in\r\nmind; and it is for her benefit that Dr. Lapham has prepared her simple\r\nbut excellent cooking directions presented in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSEVEN AVOIDABLE DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nMALARIA FEVER.\r\n\r\nMalaria, in its various manifestations, has ever constituted the\r\nprincipal obstacle to the civilization of all tropical and semi-tropical\r\ncountries, and as a consequence vast tracts of the richest and fairest\r\nportions of the world have remained uncultivated and unredeemed from\r\ntheir primitive savage state. Recent investigations have shown that this\r\ndisease can be easily prevented if the matter is taken up intelligently.\r\n\r\nMalaria is a disease produced by a parasite belonging to the very lowest\r\norder of animal life--the _Plasmodium malaria_, which is conveyed from\r\nman to man by that genus of mosquitoes called the Anopheles. The parasite\r\nattacks and destroys the red cells of the blood, and produces a poison\r\nthat causes the symptoms characteristic of malaria.\r\n\r\n_Course of the Disease._--The most common and well-recognized symptoms of\r\nmalaria are those that occur in that variety of the disease which is\r\nknown as malarial or intermittent fever. In this type the patient--who\r\nmay or may not have at intervals for some days noticed chilly sensations,\r\na feeling of fullness in the head, and general bodily depression--is\r\nsuddenly seized with a chill followed by a high fever and subsequent\r\nprofuse perspiration; after these symptoms subdue, which generally\r\nrequires several hours, the patient returns to a practically normal\r\ncondition and feels, on the whole, well until the next attack occurs.\r\nThese chills-and-fever paroxysms occur at various intervals depending\r\nupon the character of the parasite inducing them, the most common form\r\nbeing that which produces a chill every day. In some instances the malady\r\ncomes on more insidiously, there being no marked chills but only\r\nperiodical elevations of temperature.\r\n\r\nIn the more chronic forms of the disease the unfortunate victim is\r\nfrequently subjected for years to attacks of fever coming on at irregular\r\nintervals, the patient being more or less of an invalid throughout the\r\ncourse of the disease. In other instances the brain becomes affected,\r\nproducing very alarming symptoms; and in quite a proportion of cases the\r\nmalady ultimately terminates in chronic Bright's disease.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of the Disease._--Most fortunately, we have in quinine, when\r\nproperly administered, a medicine that in practically all instances acts\r\nas a specific in this affection; but it should be used only on the advice\r\nand under the directions of a physician. In the more chronic forms of the\r\ndisease, combinations of arsenic, with such tonics as nux vomica, iron,\r\nand small doses of some of the preparations of mercury, produce permanent\r\ncures where quinine has failed. It is of the utmost importance that\r\nattention be given to the treatment, as, so long as the patient remains\r\nwith the parasites in his blood, so long is he a menace to his friends\r\nand neighbors.\r\n\r\n_Mode of Infection Through Mosquitoes._--The most brilliant triumph in\r\nmodern medicine, and one of the most creditable achievements of human\r\ningenuity, has been the absolute demonstration that malaria is carried\r\nfrom man to man by means of the Anopheles mosquito, and that the disease\r\ncan, in nature, be produced in absolutely no other way. This is not a\r\ntheory, but it is a fact which has been demonstrated in its every detail\r\nbeyond dispute, and we are now happily in a condition to reject our\r\nvenerable notions concerning bad air, miasma, etc.\r\n\r\n     Before describing the method by which infection takes place, it is\r\n     well to say a few words concerning the mosquito that acts as a\r\n     carrier of the disease, which may be easily differentiated from\r\n     other similar gnats. The malarial mosquito has a body which is\r\n     placed parallel to and almost on the same plane with the front\r\n     portions of the insect, and as a consequence, when at rest on walls\r\n     or other objects, the back of the body sticks out almost or quite\r\n     at right angles with the surface upon which it is resting. The back\r\n     portion of the common mosquito forms an angle with the front part\r\n     of its body, with the effect that both ends of the insect point\r\n     toward the object upon which it rests. There are still other\r\n     differences that clearly differentiate the malarial from the common\r\n     mosquito, but the one given ordinarily serves to distinguish\r\n     between them. The malarial mosquito is pre-eminently a house-gnat,\r\n     being scarcely ever seen in the woods or open, but may be\r\n     found--oftentimes in great numbers--in all malarial localities,\r\n     lying quietly during the day in dark corners of rooms or stables.\r\n     This mosquito practically never bites in the day, but will do so\r\n     in a darkened room, if a person will remain perfectly quiet; their\r\n     favorite time for feeding is in the early parts of the night and\r\n     about daybreak--all of which accounts for the fact, long observed,\r\n     that malarial fever is almost invariably contracted at night. The\r\n     malarial mosquito bites and then goes back to some dark corner\r\n     where it remains quiescent for forty-eight hours, at the end of\r\n     which time it again descends to feed. Contrary to the general\r\n     opinion mosquitoes bite many times, and frequently remain alive for\r\n     months--the malarial mosquito particularly living in cellars and\r\n     attics oftentimes throughout the entire winter.\r\n\r\n     If one of these mosquitoes bite a person with malaria, the\r\n     parasites are sucked in along with the blood and pass into the\r\n     stomach of the gnat, making their way ultimately into the body\r\n     substance; here the parasites undergo a series of multiplications,\r\n     a single one of them sometimes producing as many as ten thousand\r\n     young malarial parasites. After the parasites have developed fully,\r\n     which requires eight days in warm weather, they make their way to\r\n     the venom-gland of the mosquito and there remain until it bites,\r\n     when they are injected into the body of the individual attacked\r\n     along with the poison.\r\n\r\n     After getting into the human blood, each parasite attacks a\r\n     red-blood cell, bores into it, and grows at the expense of the cell\r\n     until it reaches maturity, at which time it divides up into from\r\n     seven to twenty-five young parasites which are liberated and each\r\n     in turn attacks a new cell. This process goes on until a\r\n     sufficient number of parasites are produced in the individual to\r\n     cause the symptoms of malaria, and the new subject of the disease\r\n     thereafter becomes a source of danger to others in the vicinity\r\n     through the intervention of still other malarial mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n_Malaria Avoidable._--From the foregoing it is seen that the proper way\r\nto avoid malaria is so to screen houses that mosquitoes cannot enter\r\nthem. Persons in malarial districts should not sit on open porches at\r\nnight, and should be careful to sleep under properly constructed nets. If\r\nthis be done, there is absolutely no danger of anyone ever contracting\r\nthe disease. It will be well observed that these precautions are not\r\nnecessary in the daytime, as the malarial mosquito rarely attempts to\r\nbite during this period.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered by those who have the disease that they are a\r\nconstant source of danger to people living in the vicinity, and they\r\nshould be doubly careful as long as the disease persists to avoid being\r\nbitten by mosquitoes at night. It is furthermore their duty to vigorously\r\ntreat the disease until the parasites are no longer present in their\r\nbodies, at which time they cease to be a menace to others.\r\n\r\nMany children have malaria without showing symptoms, and, if allowed to\r\nsleep without being properly covered with a net, are very apt to infect a\r\nlarge number of malarial mosquitoes; the blood of children in malarial\r\nlocalities should be examined from time to time, and if the parasites be\r\nfound, the children should be given the proper remedies until a cure is\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nParticular attention should also be directed to the fact that almost all\r\nNegroes in malarial localities of the South harbor the parasites, though\r\nvery few of them show symptoms of their attacks. It is, therefore, very\r\nimportant that they be treated properly, and their white neighbors should\r\nsee to it, for their own safety, that they do not sleep in houses\r\nunprotected by nets.\r\n\r\nIf the precautions herein detailed were properly carried out, for even a\r\nfew months, malaria would practically cease to exist wherever this was\r\ndone, and would not recur unless individuals from other places suffering\r\nfrom the disease were to come into the districts where the Anopheles\r\nmosquito is present, and so give it to the gnats--to be by them\r\nrecommunicated to humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBERCULOSIS.\r\n\r\nOf all the enemies of mankind, tuberculosis, in its various forms, takes\r\nthe first rank. Of protean manifestations, occurring in almost every part\r\nof the body and producing diseases of the brain, of the nerves, of the\r\nbones, of the skin, and of all of the internal organs--pre-eminent is the\r\nterrible malady we call consumption, which is tuberculosis of the lungs.\r\nIt has been estimated that one-seventh of all the people born into the\r\nworld die as a result of this malady in some one of its various forms,\r\nand it is probable that one person out of every three dying between the\r\nages of fifteen and sixty years, succumb to this disease. As a result of\r\nthe labors of thousands of patient, self-sacrificing investigators--many\r\nof the most distinguished of whom have died of this disease while\r\ncarrying on their work--the peculiarities of this affection are now\r\nfairly well understood, and if we were to apply the knowledge which we\r\nnow possess in our attempts to free ourselves from its ravages, there is\r\nno question but that within a comparatively short period of time the\r\ndisease would practically cease to exist.\r\n\r\n_Character and Course of the Disease._--Tuberculosis is produced by a\r\nminute vegetable parasite known as the _Bacillus tuberculosis_, a germ\r\nwhich not only occurs in the human being, but is widely distributed among\r\nthe lower animals. Tuberculosis of the lungs (to restrict ourselves to\r\nthis most important manifestation) generally comes on insidiously, there\r\nbeing usually no definite period from which the sufferer can date the\r\nonset of the malady. In the early stages there is usually loss of\r\nappetite and a pronounced feeling of weakness followed by a slight cough;\r\nthe latter symptom frequently leads patients to erroneously believe that\r\ntheir trouble began with a bad cold, when as a matter of fact, the\r\ncatarrhal trouble of the throat and bronchial tubes was originally\r\nproduced by the germs of tuberculosis--there being no such thing as a\r\ncold changing into consumption. As the disease progresses the patient\r\ncomplains of fever and chills, these symptoms being oftentimes\r\nperiodical, and lead to the belief that the trouble is malarial fever:\r\nthis mistake is very common, and whenever such symptoms appear a good\r\nphysician should be immediately consulted. The patient also suffers from\r\nexhausting night-sweats in many instances, though this is not invariable.\r\nA rapid loss of flesh is one of the earliest and most common symptoms.\r\nThe symptoms above enumerated continue and grow worse, and in quite a\r\nproportion of the cases there is, in addition, spitting up blood, which\r\nin some instances may be so pronounced that it becomes a distinct\r\nhemorrhage. In the more rapid or \"galloping\" forms of the disease the\r\npatient frequently dies within a few weeks or a month or so, while in the\r\nless severe types the malady may persist for many years before death\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment of tuberculosis by drugs has proven an entire\r\nfailure, but a large number of persons afflicted with this disease will\r\nrecover, if placed under proper hygienic conditions.\r\n\r\nThe patient should be put on a porch or in a tent, whether it be winter\r\nor summer, and kept in bed at absolute rest as long as there is any\r\nfever, and should be fed in abundance with good, wholesome food. While\r\nthis treatment appears simple it should always be carried out under the\r\ndirections of a physician, as it is only possible for those having a\r\nthorough knowledge of the subject to give such directions as would lead\r\nto a rapid cure of the patient.\r\n\r\n_Modes of Infection._--Hereditary tuberculosis, notwithstanding a popular\r\nidea to the contrary, is very rare, but there is no question that those\r\npersons in whose family tuberculosis exists are much more prone to\r\ncontract the disease than others. In just what manner the germ of\r\nconsumption gains entrance to the human body, we are more or less\r\nuncertain, but there are reasons for the belief that in many instances\r\nthey pass in by means of the inhaled air; there is no doubt that in a\r\nsmall percentage of cases the bacillus gains entrance to the body through\r\nan abrasion of the skin or of some mucous membrane; finally the bacteria\r\nare often taken in with the foods that we eat, or by putting objects\r\nupon which the germs are present into the mouth, or eating with hands\r\nwhich have been contaminated and not washed. Of the foods that contain\r\nthe germs of consumption, milk is unquestionably the most common, as\r\nthere can be no question that fully 25 per cent. of our cows have this\r\ndisease, and under such circumstances their milk is usually infected with\r\nthe bacillus that produces the malady; meats, likewise, often contain\r\ngerms of this disease, but, as they are usually cooked, no harm, as a\r\nrule, results.\r\n\r\nOf quite as much importance as the introduction of the germ into the body\r\nis the resisting power of the individual at the time when this occurs,\r\nsince the disease can make no progress unless the tissues have become\r\nsusceptible through lowered resistance. All things then that have the\r\neffect of lowering the vitality of the body act as predisposing causes to\r\nconsumption; such, for example, as _WANT OF PROPER FOOD_, _LACK OF\r\nSLEEP_, _IMPROPER CLOTHING IN COLD AND WET WEATHER_, _AND LIVING IN DAMP\r\nAND IMPROPERLY VENTILATED HOUSES_; excesses, _PARTICULARLY THE TAKING OF\r\nALCOHOL_, conduce to the development of the disease--long-continued\r\ninebriety being beyond doubt the cause that most frequently leads to\r\nconsumption. It is a common error that alcoholic stimulants tend to ward\r\noff consumption, and it is absolutely certain that these substances not\r\nonly do not act in a curative way in those who have already contracted\r\nthe disease, but are positively detrimental. In order then to avoid\r\nconsumption--and this is particularly of importance for those in whose\r\nfamily there is a predisposition to the disease--the individual should\r\nlive soberly, should try at all times to obtain a reasonable amount of\r\ngood food, should sleep a sufficient number of hours, and should be\r\nclothed properly, particularly in the winter. Those who devote their time\r\nand energy to the performance of their work--being careful of course not\r\nto labor excessively--are much more apt to escape consumption than those\r\nwho do otherwise. It is particularly of importance that those who have a\r\ntendency towards consumption should early learn, and throughout life\r\npractice, the habit of _BREATHING THROUGH THE NOSE_: if this rule be\r\nfollowed a large percentage not only of the germs of consumption, but\r\nother bacteria as well, are filtered out during their passage through the\r\nnose and do not reach the lungs. Cleanliness is also of much\r\nimportance--a bath taken each morning in moderately cold water being\r\nconducive to health, not only as regards consumption but other diseases\r\nas well. It is of course necessary that dwelling houses should be kept\r\nthoroughly clean.\r\n\r\n     _Advice to Diseased Persons._--In all cases where a person observes\r\n     in himself, or in those for whom he is responsible, the symptoms\r\n     already detailed, it is his duty to at once consult an intelligent\r\n     physician, and if it be found that tuberculosis is present, every\r\n     precaution should be taken by the diseased individual to prevent\r\n     the further spread of the malady. _IN SUCH A CASE THE SPUTUM THAT\r\n     IS CONSTANTLY BEING COUGHED UP CONTAINS MYRIADS OF THE GERMS,_ and\r\n     it is of the utmost importance in order to prevent other persons in\r\n     the neighborhood from being infected that this _SPUTUM BE\r\n     DESTROYED_. The patient should at all times carry about with him\r\n     either a small receptacle into which the sputum can be\r\n     expectorated, or a large cloth which would answer the same\r\n     purpose, and in either case the sputum should be burned; if this be\r\n     impracticable, it should be placed in some good antiseptic, such as\r\n     a saturated solution of carbolic acid or a 1-to-1,000 solution of\r\n     corrosive sublimate in water. The patient's handkerchiefs should be\r\n     thoroughly boiled, and his clothing should receive like treatment.\r\n     Every precaution should at all times be observed in order to\r\n     prevent the sputum getting onto the furniture or floors, as, under\r\n     such circumstances, it quickly dries and being broken up into small\r\n     particles is carried by means of the air to other parts of the\r\n     house.\r\n\r\n     The patient should always remember that the quicker he is placed\r\n     under proper treatment the more the chances of ultimate recovery;\r\n     in the early stages almost all of the cases of this kind are\r\n     curable, but later this is not often accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPHOID FEVER.\r\n\r\nOf all of the infectious diseases prevalent in the United States, typhoid\r\nfever is one of the most common and fatal. As a result of its ravages a\r\nvast amount of invalidism, suffering and financial loss is brought about\r\neach year, and a frightful mortality results. It has for some time been\r\nrecognized that typhoid fever is among the most preventable of all\r\ndiseases, and if our people would bestir themselves and carry out the\r\ncomparatively simple rules that are necessary for its prevention, the\r\nscourge would, in a short time, practically cease to exist among us.\r\n\r\n_Character and Course of the Disease._--Typhoid fever, enteric fever, or\r\nabdominal typhus, is an infectious disease believed to be caused by a\r\nspecific bacterial germ known as the _Bacillus typhosus_. It develops, as\r\na rule, quite slowly, the first symptoms being loss of appetite,\r\nheadache, and a marked fatigue on slight exertion. These symptoms\r\ngradually grow worse, fever develops, and the patient oftentimes suffers\r\nwith chilly sensations; the temperature gradually rises, and in the\r\ncourse of from a few days to a week reaches a height of 102 degrees, 103\r\ndegrees, 104 degrees, or 105 degrees F. In many cases no symptoms exist\r\nthat indicate trouble with the bowels, but in the severe forms of the\r\ndisease diarrhoea generally comes on during the first week and continues\r\nthroughout the course of the disease.\r\n\r\nDuring the second week the symptoms above detailed continue, becoming\r\noften more severe, and there develops great nervousness and delirium.\r\nAbout this time there are frequently observed over the chest, abdomen and\r\nthighs, minute reddish spots resembling flea-bites; these spots last for\r\na few days and then pass away and are followed by a fresh crop in other\r\nsituations. During this period of the disease inflammation of the\r\nbronchial tubes frequently comes on, and now and then pneumonia develops.\r\nBleeding from the bowels is an occasional highly characteristic symptom\r\nof the second week. When the disease follows a normal course, the\r\nsymptoms during the third week begin gradually to abate; the fever\r\nlessens, and the patient, though much emaciated, gradually returns to a\r\nnormal condition.\r\n\r\n     Unfortunately, however, the disease does not always pursue this\r\n     favorable course, for, in quite a proportion of instances, the\r\n     symptoms increase in severity during the second or third week, the\r\n     patient becomes profoundly prostrated, the delirium deepens, and\r\n     death occurs. The hemorrhage from the bowels, in some instances, is\r\n     so severe that death is produced even in comparatively early stages\r\n     of the affection.\r\n\r\n     In many instances, through indiscretion, usually as a result of\r\n     eating solid food, patients who are apparently on the road to rapid\r\n     recovery, relapse, and the disease repeats the course already\r\n     detailed.\r\n\r\n     It is of importance to remember that now and then so-called walking\r\n     cases of typhoid fever occur, the disease in these instances being\r\n     characterized by the fact that the symptoms are so slight that the\r\n     sufferer does not feel it necessary to go to bed. However, in these\r\n     mild cases, fatal hemorrhage from the bowels is as frequent as in\r\n     the severer types, and as a consequence the patient should receive\r\n     careful attention. Moreover, it is of importance to remember that\r\n     from this mild form of the affection the most malignant varieties\r\n     of the disease may be contracted.\r\n\r\n     The mortality in typhoid fever varies from five to twenty per\r\n     cent., depending upon the character of the disease and the nature\r\n     of the nursing and treatment that the patient receives.\r\n\r\n_Modes of Infection._--It is clear that typhoid fever is the result of\r\nthe entrance into the body of some minute form of germ-life, whether this\r\nbe the bacterium generally supposed to induce the disease or not. This\r\ncontagion is beyond question a living something which multiplies with\r\ngreat rapidity under proper conditions, and, escaping from the bodies of\r\nthose infected with the disease, in one way or another, reaches other\r\nindividuals. It is beyond question true that the virus passes from the\r\nbody of those infected by means of the urine and feces, and it is likely\r\nthat the secretions from the mouth and nose frequently contain the germs\r\nthat cause the fever.\r\n\r\nAs the germs are certainly extraordinarily minute, a very small amount of\r\nany of these excretions might produce the disease in healthy individuals\r\nif it were to get into their bodies through water, milk, or any uncooked\r\nfood, or if it were to find lodgment about the nose or mouth, or get upon\r\nthe hands of other persons. It should also be remembered that the virus\r\nmay easily get upon cooking-utensils, drinking-cups, bed-linen, and other\r\narticles with which we are constantly brought into close contact, and\r\nthat the disease might be transmitted in this way. It is also true that\r\nthe malady may be carried from place to place by insects, particularly\r\nflies; the latter may readily get enough infectious material upon their\r\nlegs in various ways, and then, crawling over the food, leave the deadly\r\npoison deposited upon it.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of Typhoid Fever._--As soon as the symptoms appear, a\r\nphysician should be called and his directions faithfully and carefully\r\nfollowed out. Nothing in this disease is of more importance than careful\r\nnursing, and it is absolutely necessary that the patient receive only\r\nliquid diet until the physician permits other food.\r\n\r\nWherever possible then, patients with typhoid fever should be completely\r\nisolated, since, if this is not done, other members of the family are\r\nalmost sure to contract the malady--a result which almost everyone has\r\nseen who has had any experience with the disease. Wherever possible\r\npatients should be sent to a hospital, but where this cannot be done they\r\nshould be placed in an outhouse, if practicable, or in an isolated room,\r\nwhich should be thoroughly disinfected after the patient's recovery. No\r\none should visit a typhoid-fever patient, except when compelled to do so,\r\nand we should be particularly careful to prevent children from coming in\r\ncontact with them, as it has been shown that they contract the disease\r\nmuch more readily than grown people. It is also of importance that\r\npersons should not sit for any length of time in the sick room, and,\r\nabove all, under no circumstances, should cooking and eating be done\r\nthere. The room in which the patient is placed should be furnished only\r\nwith those things absolutely necessary, and it is particularly desirable\r\nthat carpets and curtains should be removed. It is well to wash the floor\r\neach day with some antiseptic solution.\r\n\r\nThose persons who come in contact with typhoid fever should wear outer\r\nclothing which can be easily washed and boiled. After touching the\r\npatient, or any of his clothing, the hands should be at once thoroughly\r\nscrubbed in an antiseptic solution. Of course, under no circumstances,\r\nshould the nurse eat or drink from the same vessels that the patient\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\nNone of the excretions from persons afflicted with typhoid fever should\r\never be emptied until thoroughly disinfected with creo-carboline or\r\nstrong lime-water, and under no circumstances should these be poured out\r\nin the neighborhood of springs or wells. Towels, handkerchiefs, and\r\nclothing that comes in contact with the patient should be thoroughly\r\ndisinfected before being sent to the laundry. This is best accomplished\r\nby thorough boiling, but in cases where this can not be at once carried\r\nout, it is advisable to use some chemical antiseptic; of these, perhaps\r\nthe best is creo-carboline, which may be employed in a 1-500 solution in\r\nwater; where this solution is not obtainable, a 5-per-cent. solution of\r\ncarbolic acid in water will answer. It should also be remembered that the\r\nwater in which typhoid-fever patients are bathed necessarily becomes\r\ninfected, and this should always be thoroughly disinfected before being\r\nemptied. These precautions should be carried out for some time after the\r\npatient has recovered, as it is well known that persons, under such\r\ncircumstances, for some time frequently contain the poison in their\r\nevacuations.\r\n\r\n     After the patient recovers, the room should be disinfected with\r\n     formaldehyde gas obtained from the substance known as \"formalin.\"\r\n     This gas may now be obtained from the formalin without the use of\r\n     heat in the following manner: When everything is ready, and the\r\n     room properly sealed, thirteen ounces of permanganate of potash to\r\n     each quart of formalin are placed in a large vessel, the room being\r\n     closed immediately after the two substances are put together; it is\r\n     important that the permanganate be placed in the vessel first. When\r\n     this method is employed a quart of formalin should be used to each\r\n     one thousand cubic feet of air-space in the room. As the gas, by\r\n     this process, comes off with great rapidity, it is not necessary\r\n     to keep the room closed more than about four hours. This method is\r\n     to be advised for the reasons that it acts more quickly than the\r\n     older one, and there is never danger of fire.\r\n\r\n     In cases where houses are too open to permit of disinfection by\r\n     means of gas, the sick chamber should be thoroughly washed with a\r\n     solution of corrosive sublimate, carbolic acid or some other good\r\n     disinfectant.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOOK-WORM DISEASE.\r\n\r\nIt has been only recently recognized that a large percentage of the\r\ninvalidism and a great number of the deaths yearly in the southern\r\nportion of the United States are caused by a very small intestinal\r\nparasite known as the _Necator americanus_, or hook-worm. This parasite\r\nhas unquestionably existed over the area just named since the advent of\r\nthe Negro--recent investigations having shown that the worm is in all\r\nprobability of African origin. This hook-worm disease is probably the\r\nmost common of all the serious diseases prevalent in the South, and as it\r\nis easily curable, and can be readily prevented, there is no matter which\r\nshould be of greater interest to the people in the infected regions,\r\nespecially those who live in villages or on farms.\r\n\r\n_Character of the Disease._--The animal parasite called hook-worm closely\r\nresembles, externally, the pin-worm which so often occurs in children.\r\nThe female, which is larger than the male, measures somewhat more than\r\nhalf an inch in length, and has the thickness of a knitting-needle; the\r\nmale is between a quarter and three-eighths of an inch in length as a\r\nrule. The parasite possesses around its mouth a row of minute plates\r\nsomewhat resembling hooklets, by means of which it grasps hold of the\r\nmucous membrane of the intestine and bruises it sufficiently to cause the\r\nblood to flow; with this blood the parasite nourishes itself. At the same\r\ntime the worm injects into the tissues a poison which has much to do with\r\nthe symptoms that occur in the disease that it produces.\r\n\r\nThese worms are usually present in great numbers, there being as a rule\r\nfrom 500 to 2,000 of them, and as they unquestionably live at least eight\r\nor ten years, the unfortunate victim suffers for a long period of time as\r\na result of their presence. While living in the intestines the females\r\nlay enormous numbers of eggs which pass out with the feces, and under\r\nsuitable conditions of temperature and moisture there develops within\r\neach of them, within from two to three days, a minute snake-like embryo\r\nwhich bursts through the shell of the egg and passes into the neighboring\r\nearth. Here the embryos live for considerable periods of time, and,\r\nultimately, may infect other individuals, or those from whom the eggs\r\nwere passed. There are at least two ways by which these embryos gain\r\nentrance into the human body. Some do so by getting into drinking-water\r\nand being swallowed; but, extraordinarily, they most frequently penetrate\r\nthrough the skin. When this happens the parasite, in passing through the\r\nskin, produces the disease known as \"ground-itch.\" The vast majority of\r\nthe victims of this affection are children with whose skin the embryo\r\ncomes in contact while they go barefooted during the summer months.\r\n\r\n_Course of the Disease._--Having entered through the skin, the embryos of\r\nthe hook-worm, moving by a circuitous route finally reach the intestines,\r\nand, grasping hold of the mucous membrane with their saw-like teeth, they\r\nbegin to suck blood and grow until they reach the size of the adult worm\r\nin about a month or six weeks. Depending upon the number which have\r\ngained entrance, and the susceptibility of the individual, there now\r\nbegins to develop symptoms of profound anæmia; the skin of the child\r\nbecomes very pale, and assumes a sort of yellowish hue, and in cases\r\nwhere there is a severe infection, the victim begins to suffer with\r\nshortness of breath and dropsy. When this occurs the patient sometimes\r\ndies, but more commonly death results from contracting some other\r\ndisease, which, under ordinary conditions, would produce no serious\r\nresults. One of the most unfortunate effects of this malady is that when\r\nchildren become infected they cease to grow, and frequently retain the\r\nappearance of early youth even after they have reached full maturity in\r\nyears. These unfortunates are generally incorrectly regarded as\r\ndirt-eaters. The symptoms frequently last over a period of many years, as\r\nin the intestines of these victims the worms that originally infect them\r\nlive certainly eight or ten years, and during this period it is beyond\r\nquestion true that additions to the original number are frequently\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis and Treatment._--There is no disease that can be\r\ndiagnosticated with more ease and certainty; the eggs are present in the\r\nfeces in great numbers, and by means of a microscope they can always be\r\ndetected. In all cases where the disease is suspected, a half-teaspoonful\r\nof the feces of the person supposed to be infected should be placed in a\r\nbottle and sent to a competent microscopist for examination. This is done\r\nfree of charge at the laboratories of most State Boards of Health in\r\nthose parts of the country where the malady exists. Whenever an\r\nindividual shows the symptoms above detailed, an intelligent physician\r\nshould at once be called. We have medicines that act as specifics, and\r\nthe disease can always be cured in a very short period of time.\r\n\r\n_Preventive Measures._--Of course the best method of preventing this\r\ndisease is to administer to those already infected the proper medicines,\r\nand cause the expulsion from the intestines of the worms that lay the\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nThe indiscriminate scattering of the feces around the stables, so very\r\ncommon in many districts, should be absolutely forbidden. Around the\r\nhouse where individuals have lived who have the disease every care should\r\nbe taken to prevent contact with the earth in the neighborhood of places\r\nwhere the ground might have become infected. It would be advisable for\r\nchildren and others to wear shoes for at least a year after the last\r\nindividual having the disease was cured; and as a precautionary measure\r\nit should be insisted upon that properly constructed privies or\r\nwater-closets should be at every house, and that they should be used by\r\neveryone in whom there is a possibility that the disease exists.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPHTHERIA AND ITS TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nLoeffler's discovery in 1884 of the germ of diphtheria, and its relation\r\nto the disease of the same name, established the specific infectious\r\nnature of this malady, and demonstrated beyond a doubt that membranous\r\ncroup is not ordinarily an independent affection, but is almost always\r\nsimply diphtheria of the wind-pipe. The discovery of antitoxin, some time\r\nlater, reduced the mortality of diphtheria from an average of 30% to 10%\r\nin ten years; its use has also shortened the course of the disease, and\r\ndecreased greatly the frequency of the paralytic conditions that not\r\nuncommonly follow this malady.\r\n\r\n_Character and Course of Diphtheria._--Diphtheria is an affection caused\r\nby a bacterial microbe which produces a poison that acts locally upon the\r\ntissues invaded, and also, as a result of its introduction into the\r\ngeneral circulation, brings about more or less profound effects on the\r\nentire system.\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation is from two to ten days. The onset is generally\r\ncharacterized by a rise of temperature from 100°F. to 104°F., chilliness,\r\nheadache, and pain in the back and limbs. Albuminuria is common. The\r\nglands of the neck often become swollen. In mild attacks a slight sore\r\nthroat is all that is complained of. In the majority of cases the disease\r\nattacks the throat and tonsils, and is characterized locally by the\r\nappearance of a membrane, which is usually gray or yellowish-white,\r\nelastic, and adheres tightly to the surface upon which it lies. At\r\ntimes, however, the membrane is soft and pliable, and is easily separated\r\nfrom the tissue; such cases are frequently diagnosticated as follicular\r\ntonsillitis. A bad cold is occasionally the only symptom of the disease.\r\nThe diagnosis should always be confirmed by bacteriologic examination. In\r\nsome instances the wind-pipe is primarily attacked, but when the disease\r\naffects this part of the throat it is generally a consequence of the\r\nextension of the membrane downward from the region of the tonsils. In the\r\nformer case the diagnosis is somewhat difficult, as cultures taken from\r\nthe throat may not show the presence of diphtheria bacilli, though\r\nmaterial that is coughed up may contain myriads of the germs; in this\r\nphase of the disease interference with respiration is the symptom most to\r\nbe feared. The mucous membrane of the nose, eyes, ears and generative\r\norgans, may be affected. Wounds are also liable to become infected with\r\nthis organism. In rare instances the membrane may extend down into the\r\nbronchial tubes and lungs, and has been found on post-mortem examination\r\ncovering the inside of the stomach.\r\n\r\nAs complications we may have broncho-pneumonia, acute Bright's disease,\r\ninflammation of the internal structures of the ears, bleeding from the\r\nnose, inflammation of the valves of the heart, and sometimes paralysis of\r\nthis organ, with death; the last named sequel of diphtheria comes on\r\nduring convalescence, usually from two to four weeks after the subsidence\r\nof local symptoms, and is due to inflammation of the nerves that control\r\nthe heart. Much less commonly paralytic conditions of the palate, throat,\r\neye muscles and the nerves of taste occur, and under rare conditions,\r\nparalysis of the lower extremities. Paralysis of some kind follows in\r\nfrom ten per cent. to fifteen per cent. of the cases, and appears with\r\nequal frequency after the mildest as well as following the most severe\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n_Mode of Infection._--The germs of diphtheria may be carried in articles\r\nused by persons with the disease, or they may be communicated by direct\r\ncontact. The micro-organism is found in the secretions from the mouth,\r\nthroat, or nose, and in particles of detached membrane. Bedding,\r\nutensils, etc., used in the room where a patient has diphtheria, are\r\nliable to carry the germs if taken from the sick-room, and consequently\r\nshould be always properly disinfected before being removed. Milk-bottles\r\ncarried into the sick-room, or handled by persons caring for the patient,\r\nshould never be returned to the dealer without being disinfected. Cats,\r\nand less frequently dogs, may contract the disease and convey it to those\r\nwith whom they come in contact. Unrecognized mild cases are a frequent\r\nmeans of spreading the disease, as also is a too early release of\r\npatients after recovery. It is a much safer method of procedure to\r\nrequire at least two negative examinations before releasing a patient\r\nfrom quarantine, as during convalescence the germs may be entirely absent\r\non one day and a few days later be quite abundant. The bacilli may remain\r\nin the throat from a few days to several years after the disease is\r\napparently entirely well, and under such circumstances the persons\r\ncarrying them become quite as great, if not a greater, menace to those\r\nwith whom they came in contact as they were during the height of the\r\ndisease. A thorough disinfection of the room and everything used about\r\nthe sick person should be carried out after the patient is released.\r\nComplete isolation should be observed during the illness, and as long as\r\nthe bacilli remains in the throat.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Diphtheria antitoxin is the specific treatment of this\r\nmalady, and should be given early in the disease. The chances of recovery\r\ndecrease in proportion to the length of time existing between the onset\r\nof the affection and the time of administration of the drug. Antitoxin\r\nmay be repeated in six hours after the initial injection if improvement\r\nis not noticed, but ordinarily twenty-four hours should elapse between\r\ndoses. It is well to remember that it is safer to give too much antitoxin\r\nthan too little. The initial curative dose varies from 2,000 to 5,000\r\nunits, according to the age of the patient and the severity of the\r\ndisease. When a case is seen late it is often advisable to begin with a\r\nlarge dose,--it being good practice under such circumstances to use at\r\nonce as much as 10,000 units or even more. The average case requires from\r\nthe beginning to the end of the treatment a total of from 10,000 to\r\n20,000 units, but occasionally 50,000 or even 100,000 units may be\r\nnecessary. There are very few risks in giving antitoxin. In a series of\r\n50,000 cases treated with it only two deaths occurred sufficiently early\r\nafter the injections to warrant the belief that this unhappy result was\r\nproduced by the drug. It is worth remembering that asthmatic cases bear\r\nthe administration of antitoxin very poorly; a marked and sometimes\r\nserious embarrassment of respiration, with cyanosis, unconsciousness, and\r\ngeneral collapse may follow its use, but recovery is usual in such cases.\r\n\r\n     A condition known as anaphylaxis or hypersensitiveness, which at\r\n     present is being much studied, may sometimes occur in the human\r\n     being. This hypersensitiveness is manifested by the extraordinary\r\n     peculiarity that any number of doses of antitoxin may be given\r\n     provided they are administered within a period of less than ten or\r\n     twelve days. On the other hand a single minute dose may induce this\r\n     state after the period named, and, as we never know whether a\r\n     patient is going to develop it or not, it becomes a question as to\r\n     the safety of giving a second injection after ten or twelve days\r\n     have elapsed following the administration of the initial treatment.\r\n     As it is true that this hypersensitiveness once established in\r\n     animals may continue throughout life, it becomes a question as to\r\n     whether or not it is quite safe to administer antitoxin to an\r\n     individual who has had the drug given him at some prior time, and\r\n     we are not as yet in a position to definitely determine the risks\r\n     that are involved in such a procedure. There is no reason to doubt\r\n     that this hypersensitiveness is much less marked in man than in the\r\n     lower animals, and there can be no question that it much less\r\n     commonly develops, but notwithstanding this it would be the part of\r\n     prudence to avoid a second administration of the drug after the\r\n     interval referred to in all instances where this seems possible.\r\n     Anaphylaxis is thus seen to bear an important relationship to what\r\n     is commonly called the \"immunizing treatment\" to prevent\r\n     diphtheria, which consists in giving a moderate dose of antitoxin\r\n     to a person immediately after exposure to the disease. Under such\r\n     circumstances a degree of immunity is undoubtedly secured, but this\r\n     passes off in the course of a few weeks, and the patient then\r\n     becomes just as susceptible as he was before. Should he now\r\n     contract diphtheria, we would be confronted with the possibility\r\n     that the treatment by means of antitoxin might possibly produce\r\n     serious and even fatal results.\r\n\r\n     Occasionally rashes occur several days after the inoculation, but\r\n     such disturbances are insignificant except for the immediate\r\n     discomfort experienced. Antitoxin concentrated by the Gibson method\r\n     has reduced to a considerable extent the number of cases in which\r\n     rashes occur.\r\n\r\nTreatment other than by antitoxin is symptomatic. Where the disease\r\noccurs in the wind-pipe, it may be necessary to pass a tube into its\r\nupper opening to allow the patient to breathe, and in other instances the\r\nwind-pipe is itself opened from the outside in order to permit a\r\nsufficient amount of air to enter the lungs to maintain life.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that patients be kept in bed until all\r\ndanger of complications has passed. Death from heart-failure several\r\nweeks after the diphtheria in the throat is well, is not an uncommon\r\nresult of the disease, and is especially prone to follow even the\r\nslightest exertion. Patients under such circumstances have been known to\r\ndie from raising themselves up in the bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEREBROSPINAL MENINGITIS.\r\n\r\nMeningitis, or spotted fever, is one of the most terrible and fatal of\r\nall diseases, every case proving fatal in some local epidemics.\r\n\r\nAlthough the cause of the disease has been known for a number of years,\r\nthe exact method by which the germ that produces it spreads from man to\r\nman was until quite recently entirely unrecognized, and even now it\r\ncannot be said that the whole matter has been demonstrated.\r\n\r\n_Character and Course of the Disease._--Cerebrospinal meningitis is\r\nproduced by a minute vegetable (bacterium), the _Micrococcus\r\nintracellularis_. This germ does not appear to occur normally in any of\r\nthe lower animals, nor has it been found in the outer world, and is\r\ntherefore to be regarded as distinctly a human parasite. It is very\r\nfortunately a germ of low vitality, as it develops only at about blood\r\nheat, and when expelled from its normal dwelling-place in the human body\r\nit dies very quickly.\r\n\r\n     The accompanying illustration shows how these bacteria appear under\r\n     the microscope; the drawing was made from fluid taken from the\r\n     spinal canal of a patient suffering from cerebrospinal meningitis.\r\n     These germs get within the skull and spinal canal, and produce\r\n     violent inflammation of the coverings of the brain and cord; these\r\n     membranes are called \"meninges,\" hence the name \"cerebrospinal\r\n     meningitis.\" Within a short time after their entrance pus is\r\n     produced, and the condition becomes practically one of abscess\r\n     around the brain and spinal cord.\r\n\r\nIn almost all cases the disease is preceded by a slight catarrhal\r\ncondition of the nose and throat, the symptoms being those of an\r\nordinary cold. The symptoms that point to the covering of the brain being\r\nattacked come on with great suddenness; there is usually a chill,\r\nfollowed by intense headache, vomiting, restlessness, with great dread of\r\nnoises and bright light; in many cases reddish spots appear beneath the\r\nskin, and these are usually tender on pressure. In some cases the muscles\r\nof the neck become very stiff, and contract so that the head is drawn\r\nbackward. The temperature is somewhat irregular, but is always above\r\nnormal in the beginning, and sometimes goes very high; the pulse as a\r\nrule is normal, or but little accelerated. After the patient remains in\r\nthis condition for a period varying from a few hours to several days, he\r\ngenerally becomes unconscious, and in a comparatively short time dies. In\r\nsome cases the symptoms after starting off very violently quickly\r\nsubside, and the patient makes a comparatively rapid recovery. In other\r\ninstances the disease begins more mildly, the patient having more or less\r\nof the usual symptoms, but not so severely as is ordinarily the case; in\r\nsuch cases the patient may die, after lingering weeks or months; or may\r\nmake a protracted recovery, frequently with partial paralytic conditions\r\nthat permanently remain.\r\n\r\n     Unfortunately we possess no specific for this disease. Recently\r\n     there has come into vogue a treatment by a serum supposed to have\r\n     antitoxic power against this disease, but its exact value is, as\r\n     yet, by no means settled; it must be used early if any good is to\r\n     be expected from it. In addition to the antitoxin all that can be\r\n     done is to keep the patient quiet with anodynes, and to minister to\r\n     his comfort in every way possible. Ice applications to the head\r\n     sometimes alleviate the intense headache. As the disease is\r\n     practically an abscess around the brain and cord, perhaps the most\r\n     rational treatment would be to open up the skull and let the pus\r\n     drain away.\r\n\r\n_Mode of Infection._--As this disease is one that is due to a specific\r\ngerm it is obvious that it cannot exist without the presence of this\r\norganism; the malady is therefore infectious, and must necessarily be to\r\na certain extent contagious, notwithstanding the fact that it is\r\ngenerally thought not to be so. The reason that the affection has not\r\nbeen thought to be contagious may be explained by the following facts:\r\nRecent investigation has shown that in many, if not all, instances of\r\nthis disease, the germ may be found in the nose and throat, where, as\r\nhas already been explained, it sets up a condition resembling an ordinary\r\ncold. In all probability the infection takes place in the nasal cavity\r\nfirst, and the germ ultimately finds its way to the coverings of the\r\nbrain. Now there is every reason to believe that in many, and probably in\r\na great majority of instances, the germ goes no further than the mucous\r\nmembrane of the nose, and the patient merely has as a consequence what he\r\nconsiders an ordinary cold. It is clear, however, that if another\r\nindividual, who was very susceptible to this germ, should contract the\r\ndisease from this person, he might have the meningeal form of it. In\r\nother words, it is probably true that the vast majority of people who are\r\nattacked by this organism simply get colds as a consequence, and only now\r\nand then does a person get meningitis as a result. This explains why the\r\ndisease does not ordinarily appear contagious.\r\n\r\nThe facts above stated are of much importance in combating the spread of\r\nthis disease. People who are exposed to those having meningitis should be\r\nexceedingly careful not to get upon their persons any of the secretions\r\nthat come from the patient, and during periods of epidemics those who\r\nobserve a bad cold coming on should promptly consult their physicians,\r\nand do everything to prevent the development of all catarrhal conditions\r\nin their noses.\r\n\r\nDuring epidemics persons with colds should be very careful not to allow\r\nother people to become infected from them. As cold and wet are\r\nundoubtedly predisposing causes to colds it is well for everyone to shun\r\nsuch exposure during periods when meningitis is prevalent; debilitating\r\ninfluences, such as alcoholic excess and lack of sleep, should also be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROPHOBIA.\r\n\r\nThis disease, as it occurs in man, is practically always conveyed by the\r\nbite of some animal, the dog being the usual offender. The poison is\r\npresent in the saliva of the diseased animal and is transmitted through\r\nwounds made by its bite.\r\n\r\nAs observed in the dog, there are two types of the disease,--one the\r\n\"furious,\" the other the \"paralytic.\"\r\n\r\n     _In the furious type_ the animal first appears to be restless and\r\n     somewhat excited. He seeks dark places and apparently prefers to be\r\n     by himself. In this stage of the disease the dog's appetite is good\r\n     and may be excessive; he responds to orders although his attention\r\n     can be attracted only for a moment at a time. As the malady\r\n     progresses the animal becomes more and more restless, and develops\r\n     a desire to tear those things about him into pieces. There is\r\n     described a peculiar bark at this stage of the disease; instead of\r\n     ending as it ordinarily does, it is prolonged and terminates in a\r\n     higher pitched note simulating a cry. This is supposed to be very\r\n     characteristic at this stage of the affection. The appetite\r\n     gradually diminishes, food is refused, and swallowing becomes\r\n     difficult. As the symptoms gradually progress the dog shows signs\r\n     of delirium and begins to wander. As a rule, he goes about with his\r\n     tail hung, mouth wide open, and with a wild look in his eyes,\r\n     biting as he goes, anything that happens to be directly in his\r\n     path; seldom does he turn aside to disturb anything or anybody. In\r\n     the later stages of the disease paralysis generally develops,\r\n     beginning in the hind legs and soon involving the body. If the\r\n     animal be now carefully observed it will be seen that he cannot\r\n     swallow. There is no dread of water, as the name \"hydrophobia\"\r\n     implies, and as is commonly thought, the animal often attempting to\r\n     drink, but owing to the paralysis of the muscles of the throat this\r\n     is impossible. Inability then to swallow either water or solid food\r\n     is one of the surest and most reliable signs of rabies. Weakness\r\n     becomes very marked, and the animal finally lies down in a stupor\r\n     and dies. The entire course of this type may last from six to ten\r\n     days; generally it is four or five.\r\n\r\n     _The paralytic type_ of the disease occurs in fifteen or twenty per\r\n     cent. of the cases. The onset is, as a rule, the same as that\r\n     observed in the furious type. Instead, however, of the dog\r\n     beginning to wander, as previously mentioned, the animal becomes\r\n     paralyzed, the paralysis first affecting the muscles of the jaw,\r\n     later of the tongue. As is the case in the furious type of the\r\n     disease, the animal loses the power to swallow both solids and\r\n     liquids, but has no fear of water. The mouth remains wide open, the\r\n     tongue protruding, and an abundant amount of thick saliva exudes.\r\n     The animal remains quiet, does not attempt to bite any animal or\r\n     individual. Death occurs on the second or third day of the disease.\r\n\r\n_Precautions._--When an individual is bitten by an animal either supposed\r\nor known to be rabid, the wound should be immediately cauterized with\r\nsome caustic, preferably concentrated nitric acid. This should be applied\r\nwithout fear because it is safer to use too much than too little. In case\r\nthis is not available any strong caustic may be used. Punctured wounds\r\nshould be laid open with a knife and the surfaces freely cauterized. It\r\nshould not be forgotten that the slightest scratch from the tooth of a\r\nrabid animal may lead to the development of hydrophobia in man, and it\r\ntherefore behooves all persons bitten by dogs to take every precaution\r\npossible. Even though the animal at the time may appear to be healthy,\r\nsome strong antiseptic should be applied to the wound, and the animal\r\ncarefully watched until all possibility of his having the disease has\r\npassed. Many persons have died from slight wounds inflicted by animals\r\nappearing at the time to be perfectly well.\r\n\r\nAttention should also be directed to the fact that wounds where the teeth\r\nof the animal pass through the clothing are not so dangerous as those\r\nwhere no such protection intervenes. Bites about the face and head are\r\nmuch more frequently followed by rabies than those inflicted on the\r\nextremities, and, of course, where wounds are deep the chances of\r\ninfection are much greater; where injuries of the latter kind are\r\ninflicted it is practically out of the question to thoroughly cauterize\r\nthem, and the patient should immediately receive the Pasteur treatment.\r\nIt is probable that if thorough cauterization be not done within five\r\nminutes that it cannot be relied on to prevent the development of the\r\ndisease; where there is any doubt the only safety lies in the Pasteur\r\ntreatment. Where a person is bitten by a dog supposed to be rabid the\r\nanimal should be caught, if possible, and kept carefully isolated for at\r\nleast ten days; should it appear well after the expiration of this period\r\nno fear need be felt as to the results of its bite, but if it should die\r\nthe head should be cut off, packed in ice, and sent to some laboratory\r\nfor examination.\r\n\r\n_Under no condition should the animal be killed, as the best possible\r\nproof of the harmlessness of its bite would lie in its continuing to\r\nlive._\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Since the epoch-making researches of Pasteur, laboratories\r\nhave been installed in various parts of the world for the purpose of\r\nmaking a vaccine by means of which it is possible, by gradual\r\nimmunization, to prevent the development of hydrophobia in persons bitten\r\nby rabid dogs. This is done by a series of injections of a weak virus\r\nprepared according to the directions of Pasteur. _It should always be\r\nremembered that no harm can come from the treatment whether the patient\r\nwas bitten by a rabid dog or not, and that in all cases of doubt no\r\nhesitation should be felt in resorting to it._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nHYGIENE OF THE SICK ROOM\r\n\r\n\r\nFar too little attention is generally accorded to the proper care of the\r\nsick,--the prevailing opinion being that the royal road to recovery under\r\nthe circumstances is opened up only through the taking of drugs, and that\r\nprovided the appropriate ones be given in sufficient quantities recovery\r\nwill result. No greater mistake is possible. As a matter of fact, there\r\nare very few diseases for which we have medicines that act in a specific\r\nmanner, and far more is usually to be hoped for from good nursing.\r\nFortunately the general public is beginning to recognize the truth of the\r\nstatements just made. It has only been a short time since the trained\r\nnurse was unknown except in the larger medical centres, but now her\r\npresence and beneficent influence is being felt from one end of the land\r\nto the other, and her importance is destined to increase with the onward\r\nmarch of time; she is undoubtedly the greatest advance that we have made\r\nin medicine during the last decade.\r\n\r\nWhere persons are ill they should always be attended by a trained nurse\r\nif possible, but if this is out of the question a few suggestions as to\r\nthe sick room and its hygiene should certainly not be omitted from any\r\nbook dealing with rural sanitation.\r\n\r\n_Ventilation and Warmth._--The sick room if possible should be located on\r\nthe sunny side of the house, and should have fire in a fireplace if the\r\nweather be cold. It is of the utmost consequence that the room have\r\nwindows and doors by means of which it can be at all times thoroughly\r\nventilated. At all seasons of the year a room on the lowest floor of the\r\nhouse is more satisfactory, since it is warmer in the winter and cooler\r\nin the summer. The room should not be uncomfortably cold, though it is\r\nmuch better to have the temperature too low than to have the air stuffy.\r\nIn most diseases ventilation is of supreme importance, and should be\r\nsecured at any cost. Where, however, it is compatible with thorough\r\nventilation, a temperature of about 70°F. is generally considered most\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nBefore a patient is moved into a room all superfluous furniture should be\r\ntaken out, particularly carpets and hangings of all kinds. It is likewise\r\nof the utmost importance that all insects, particularly flies, be\r\nexcluded by proper screening.\r\n\r\nThe patient's bed should be narrow, and a mattress is much to be\r\npreferred to a feather bed. The mattress should be protected by a rubber\r\nsheet or newspaper pads; oil-cloth cracks and wrinkles too badly to be of\r\nservice for this purpose. The rubber sheet should of course be kept under\r\nthe sheet nearest the mattress. The cover should consist of a sheet which\r\nis long enough to fold back at the head over the other covering for some\r\ndistance, and blankets should be used for warmth in preference to quilts.\r\nThe bed should be kept scrupulously clean, and the linen and covering\r\nshould be removed when soiled. The nurse should see to it that\r\nbread-crumbs do not remain in the bed.\r\n\r\nIn removing soiled bed-clothes the following plan is the one usually\r\nadopted. The patient is moved to one side of the bed as near the edge as\r\npossible, and the sheet beneath him loosened at the head and the foot and\r\non the opposite side; it is then rolled up toward the patient and pushed\r\nwell up under him, leaving the side of the bed opposite to that upon\r\nwhich he is lying bare; upon this the new sheet is placed, which is then\r\ntucked under the edges of the mattress, and the patient rolls or is\r\npulled back over on it. The soiled sheet is then removed and the edges of\r\nthe fresh one pulled over the portions of the bed still uncovered, and\r\nsecured in the usual way.\r\n\r\n_General Precautions._--The room should also be kept scrupulously clean;\r\nall sweepings should be burned. Soiled linen and all excretions from the\r\npatient should be promptly removed, and if the latter need not be\r\npreserved for the inspection of the physician, should be at once\r\ndisinfected and properly disposed of. Milk and other food should not be\r\nleft in the sick room; and soiled glasses and dishes should be removed\r\nand washed at once in boiling water.\r\n\r\nPersons who are ill should not be allowed to have company. There is\r\nnothing more important in connection with the looking after patients with\r\ninfectious diseases than this precaution. The writer has often seen in\r\nthe country districts patients with typhoid fever and other infectious\r\ndiseases surrounded by the neighbors from miles around,--the entire\r\ncompany often eating and drinking in the room occupied by the afflicted\r\nperson. The strain that results on the patient from a practice of this\r\nkind might well in many cases have fatal consequences, and there is no\r\nquestion whatever that many diseases, particularly typhoid fever, are\r\nscattered in this way from house to house and from one community to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe diet should be given regularly and should consist strictly of only\r\nsuch things as are allowed by the physician.\r\n\r\nAll medicines should be given absolutely according to directions, as\r\notherwise having a doctor is worse than useless.\r\n\r\nAll patients should have a daily bath, special attention being given to\r\ntheir hair, teeth, mouth and nails. In many cases it is necessary to\r\nwash the patient's mouth frequently with some antiseptic wash. This\r\nshould only be done on the expressed instructions of the doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nEMERGENCIES AND ACCIDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nFew things are of greater importance, and nothing is more neglected than\r\ninstructing school-children how to act in emergencies. Particularly is\r\nsuch knowledge of value in the country. In cities the need of\r\nunderstanding matters of this kind is not so great, since it is usually\r\npossible to secure at short notice some one capable of dealing with any\r\nsituation that may arise. Children very quickly grasp knowledge of this\r\ncharacter, and opportunities frequently offer for an actual demonstration\r\nof the proper remedies in the case of accidents. When the instructor\r\nspeaks of cuts and burns they at once understand what is meant.\r\n\r\nThe most serious result of our neglect in this particular is that our\r\nchildren pass through life with the most meagre knowledge of the proper\r\nway in which to meet accidents of all sorts, for where they are not\r\ntaught during their school days they, for the most part, remain ignorant\r\nof matters of this kind throughout their maturer years. It is much to be\r\nhoped--though this is somewhat of a digression--that the old unscientific\r\nand senseless system of teaching, which persists even in the present time\r\nto a considerable degree, may in the future give way to a more rational\r\nand practical plan of instruction--one that will deal with perceptible\r\nneeds rather than abstractions.\r\n\r\nThe most common emergencies will now be taken up and considered in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n_Drowning._--The subject of drowning is one of especial interest in rural\r\ndistricts, since it is here that accidents of this kind are most apt to\r\noccur, and skilled attention is most difficult to obtain. It is of the\r\nutmost importance to remember that people may be resuscitated after\r\nhaving been under the water for considerable periods of time, and we\r\nshould, therefore, look upon no ordinary cases as hopeless until the\r\nproper restorative measures have failed.\r\n\r\nOn removing the body from the water we should not waste time by\r\nattempting to drain the water from the victim's mouth, as the amount of\r\nthis substance that enters the air-passages under such circumstances is\r\nso trifling that it may be entirely disregarded. The drowned person\r\nshould be placed face down upon the ground with the head slightly turned\r\nto the left, and we should begin at once with artificial respiration.\r\n\r\n_Artificial Respiration._--This is accomplished by the operator kneeling\r\nbetween the separated legs of the patient and placing his hands on the\r\nsmall of his back, the thumbs nearly meeting at the middle of the spine,\r\nand the other fingers spread out over the lower portion of the chest; the\r\noperator then sways his body downward and forward slowly, counting three\r\nduring the movement, then quickly swinging backward releasing the\r\npressure on the patient's chest; again count three and repeat the\r\noriginal movement. The pressure should be brought to bear from twelve to\r\nfourteen times a minute, and the movement should be kept up until the\r\npatient begins to show evidences of being restored, or until it is quite\r\nevident that life is extinct.\r\n\r\nThis system of artificial respiration was originated by Professor\r\nSchafer, as the head of a commission appointed by the British\r\nGovernment, and is now universally regarded as being by far the most\r\nsatisfactory of all such methods.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying figures are shown the positions assumed by the\r\npatient and operator while carrying on artificial respiration.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that the victims of accidents of this kind suffer\r\nconsiderably from lowering of the temperature of the body as a\r\nconsequence of the long exposure to water, and we should, therefore, also\r\ndirect our attention toward bringing about an immediate reaction by means\r\nof warm blankets and hot bottles, and by vigorous rubbing of the\r\npatient's body.\r\n\r\n_Danger from Wounds._--Wounds may be produced by a great variety of\r\nobjects, but chiefly, of course, by cutting instruments. Where they are\r\ncaused by duller objects, producing more or less tearing and bruising of\r\nthe tissues, they are more apt to be followed by infection with\r\ndisease-producing germs than where smoothly cut, and consequently require\r\ngreater care in treatment. Germs sufficient to produce death may be\r\nintroduced into the body by the most minute wound; it is for example well\r\nknown that fatal consequences have resulted from the bites of various\r\ninsects, and the writer has personally seen a case where a pin-prick was\r\nfollowed by lockjaw and death. Such facts teach us that we should be\r\ncareful in avoiding wounds of all kinds, and, that after they have been\r\nreceived, they deserve attention, however insignificant they may appear\r\nto be.\r\n\r\n     Wounds resulting from objects more or less covered with dirt are\r\n     particularly dangerous, since under such circumstances the germs of\r\n     lockjaw are apt to be introduced into the body, and fatal\r\n     consequences not uncommonly ensue. It is astonishing how frequently\r\n     the disease just referred to follows where a barefooted child\r\n     sticks a dirty splinter or a rusty nail into its foot, and it\r\n     cannot be too strongly urged that it is the duty of the parent in\r\n     such instances to call in a competent physician at once. The reason\r\n     that injuries of this kind are so apt to be followed by lockjaw is\r\n     that the germ that produces the disease lives practically\r\n     everywhere in the earth--being especially common in the rich soil\r\n     of gardens and other highly fertilized earths; and the germs are so\r\n     minute that thousands of them might be present on the point of a\r\n     pin without being visible to the naked eye. The bacilli of lockjaw\r\n     do not grow at all where exposed freely to the oxygen of the air,\r\n     and as a consequence of this fact we rarely see the disease that\r\n     they produce developing after slight superficial wounds; much more\r\n     commonly the malady results from a wound made by some penetrating\r\n     object, such as a splinter of wood, a nail, or a pin.\r\n\r\n     The lesson that these facts teach is that where wounds are small\r\n     and deep it is the part of wisdom to cut them open freely in order\r\n     that they may be cleansed as far as is possible, and at the same\r\n     time allow the air to obtain free access to their deepest portions;\r\n     a wound of this kind should not be sewn up, but should be left open\r\n     and allowed gradually to heal up.\r\n\r\n     The reason why lockjaw so frequently follows wounds from the\r\n     premature explosion of fireworks is that the paper used in fire\r\n     crackers, etc., often contains the germs of the disease and is\r\n     driven deeply into the tissues. In view of the very considerable\r\n     mortality that yearly occurs among the children of this country it\r\n     seems incomprehensible that our legislatures--which commonly\r\n     exhibit such an uncontrollable desire to regulate their neighbors\r\n     in every possible way--should not long ago have placed the ban on\r\n     fireworks of all kinds.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of Wounds._--The treatment of wounds necessarily depends to a\r\nconsiderable extent on their character and general severity: there are\r\ncertain practices, however, that apply in all cases, and should,\r\ntherefore, be resorted to wherever injuries of this kind occur. Where the\r\nwound is superficial the bleeding is as a rule trifling in character,\r\nand very quickly stops of its own accord. In other cases, particularly\r\nwhere deep, larger blood-vessels may be severed, and if they be of any\r\nconsiderable size, the hemorrhage will not cease until the subject\r\nbecomes exceedingly weak, and in some instances the bleeding will go on\r\nuntil death results. Where bleeding is profuse, it may generally be\r\nassumed that one of the larger vessels has been cut, and under such\r\ncircumstances it should be compressed until skilled assistance arrives.\r\nThere is a popular but very erroneous impression that arteries can only\r\nbe stopped by tying; as a matter of fact any one possesses sufficient\r\nstrength in the fingers to pinch them enough to stop the hemorrhage. If\r\npossible, the operator should get his finger down into the wound, after\r\nwhich he can quickly discover the exact point where pressure stops the\r\nbleeding. One who is unaccustomed to surgical practices would, of course,\r\nhesitate at doing this, but it cannot be too strongly urged that a\r\nprocedure of this character produces little or no pain after the finger\r\nis first introduced, and that no one should be deterred by foolish\r\nsqueamishness from immediately doing that which in many instances can\r\nonly save the life of the victim.\r\n\r\n     Where arteries are evidently bleeding--which may be inferred from\r\n     the spurting character of the hemorrhage--a tight bandage above the\r\n     seat of the wound, if on one of the extremities, will often be\r\n     followed by a cessation of the bleeding, and where only small\r\n     vessels are cut, a bandage tightly applied over the wound itself\r\n     may accomplish a similar result. Under such circumstances the\r\n     reader should be warned that it is not safe to leave a limb tightly\r\n     bandaged in this way for any considerable length of time, as\r\n     complete death of the part below may result. Where then a ligature\r\n     is placed above or over a wound, it should be loosened cautiously\r\n     every twenty or thirty minutes, and should be left off for a time.\r\n     If the wounded artery begins to bleed, one should resort to local\r\n     pressure upon it with the finger for five or ten minutes, after\r\n     which the bandage may again be applied.\r\n\r\nAs soon as all bleeding has ceased, the wound should be thoroughly washed\r\nout by means of water that has been boiled and allowed to cool; the\r\noperation may be greatly assisted by using a rag or a piece of cotton\r\nthat was boiled in the water. If there be grease or other dirt that does\r\nnot readily come away soap may be freely used.\r\n\r\nAfter the wound has been thoroughly cleansed, some sort of antiseptic had\r\nbetter be applied. Unquestionably the best of all of these is tincture of\r\niodine, a small amount of which should be poured directly into the wound.\r\nA saturated solution of carbolic acid in water is also a fairly good\r\ndisinfectant, and may be employed where the tincture of iodine cannot be\r\nobtained. A solution of corrosive sublimate in water--one part of the\r\nformer to one thousand parts of the latter--is much used as an antiseptic\r\nby surgeons, but when placed directly in wounds has a tendency to cause\r\nmuch irritation, and is by no means so efficient as either of the\r\ndisinfectants just referred to. In the country it is an old custom to use\r\nturpentine, or resins from several different species of pines; these are\r\nfairly efficient antiseptics, and should be employed where it is\r\nimpossible to obtain those that are better. It should always be\r\nremembered that thorough washing out with boiled water and soap is in\r\nitself a procedure that will remove a considerable proportion of any\r\ngerms that may have got into the wound, and that if carefully done, it\r\nis almost as efficient as the best antiseptic.\r\n\r\nAfter the wound has been thoroughly cleansed by water and antiseptics, it\r\nshould then be bandaged with a cloth that has been previously boiled and\r\ndried, if no regular surgical dressing is at hand. Every precaution\r\nshould then be taken to prevent it being reopened. Collodion is sometimes\r\nused over small wounds, and is quite efficient in that it forms a coating\r\nover any surface upon which it is placed that is impermeable to both air\r\nand water. Small wounds that have been thoroughly cleansed and\r\ndisinfected with tincture of iodine may be safely and satisfactorily\r\nclosed by means of the substance just mentioned, but it should never be\r\nforgotten that the germ of lockjaw--which is the one, ordinarily, most to\r\nbe dreaded in such injuries--lives and grows best in the absence of the\r\noxygen of the air, and that a covering of collodion would materially\r\nassist in the development of this dreadful disease.\r\n\r\nIn those instances where pus forms in wounds, they should be at once\r\nreopened and allowed to drain. It very often follows after\r\ncuts--particularly if they be not properly cleansed--that a scab forms on\r\nthe outside, holding beneath a greater or less amount of pus. The\r\npresence of the latter can generally be inferred by a wound presenting a\r\nred and angry appearance around its edges, and from swelling and pain. As\r\nsoon as such a condition is observed, the scab should be thoroughly\r\nsoaked in water and removed, and it is then necessary that the wound be\r\nkept open and allowed to drain freely until it heals up from the bottom.\r\nA failure to observe precautions of this kind may result in\r\nblood-poisoning, and finally even in death. After a wound begins to\r\nsuppurate it does little good to put antiseptics into it, as they cause\r\nconsiderable irritation, and under no circumstances do they put an end to\r\nthe pus formation. Open drainage of the wound, and keeping up the general\r\nhealth of the patient, are the only means that we possess of successfully\r\ncombating conditions of this kind.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as we possess an antitoxin that unquestionably has the power of\r\npreventing lockjaw, if given sufficiently early, it is the part of\r\nwisdom to administer at once a sufficient dose of this substance to any\r\nchild who has received a penetrating wound from some dirty object, or\r\nfrom the explosion of fire-crackers. Statistics show that under such\r\ncircumstances lockjaw may be prevented in almost all cases. If we wait\r\nuntil the disease develops, the antitoxin is of no value.\r\n\r\n_Care of Sprains._--The seriousness of sprains is very generally\r\nunderestimated, and as a consequence many persons go through life with\r\nankles that are abnormally weak, and even painful in bad weather, and in\r\nwhich there is a tendency to swell and become exceedingly troublesome\r\nafter a slight wrench. In all true sprains there is more or less actual\r\ntearing of the ligaments that bind the joint together, and, if the injury\r\nbe not properly treated and the joint thoroughly supported, complete\r\nrecovery in many instances never takes place.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a sprain occurs the injured joint should be immersed in water\r\njust as warm as can be borne, and hot water should be from time to time\r\nadded in order to keep the temperature sufficiently high. The bath should\r\nbe continued for several hours--the longer the better. Thus the pain and\r\nswelling will be greatly reduced, and the tenderness which, in the\r\nbeginning, is so excruciating, will largely disappear. The next step is\r\nto properly support the injured parts in order that unnecessary movement\r\nmay be prevented, thus avoiding further tearing of the ligaments. This\r\nmay be accomplished by means of various splints--the most popular being\r\nthose made of plaster of Paris, or silicate of sodium, either of which\r\nwill require the services of a physician in order to have them properly\r\napplied.\r\n\r\n     Within recent years a treatment has come much into vogue, which is\r\n     exceedingly satisfactory, and has the advantage that it does not\r\n     require the service of an expert in order to have it properly\r\n     carried out. This consists in the application of strips of adhesive\r\n     plaster to the skin over the seat of the injury and for some\r\n     distance both above and below the joint affected. Ordinary\r\n     sticking-plaster is not the best for this purpose, though in an\r\n     emergency it might be used; much better is the so-called mole-skin\r\n     plaster, which is much thicker, and does not require moistening\r\n     before being applied. The plaster should be torn into strips about\r\n     three-fourths of an inch wide and twelve to eighteen inches long.\r\n     Where the ankle is the seat of the trouble, a strip is firmly\r\n     applied to the back of the foot, beginning just behind the toes,\r\n     and is brought around the ankle and carried up on to the calf of\r\n     the leg--thus partially winding the plaster around the leg. The\r\n     first strip having been applied, another is put on in a similar\r\n     way, the edges of the latter overlapping those of the former. This\r\n     is continued until one side of the ankle is fairly well covered,\r\n     after which we may begin operations on the opposite side, carrying\r\n     the strips around the leg in such a way as to meet and overlap\r\n     those first put on. This process is continued until the entire\r\n     joint is completely covered with the plaster. It is of the utmost\r\n     importance that the foot be put in a natural position before we\r\n     begin to apply the plaster, as, otherwise, it will be left in a\r\n     constrained and uncomfortable position, which will do away largely\r\n     with the good effects of the splint. Where carried out in the\r\n     proper way it is in the highest degree astonishing to see how\r\n     perfectly the joint is supported, with the effect that the use of\r\n     the injured limb may be immediately resumed. The writer recalls\r\n     having seen a young lady with a frightful sprain, who could not\r\n     bear to touch her foot to the floor, improve to such an extent\r\n     under the treatment as outlined that she was able to go to a ball\r\n     and dance through the evening on the day the injury occurred.\r\n\r\nNot only does the immediate resuming of the use of an injured limb, when\r\ntreated in this way, appear not to be injurious, but the ultimate\r\nrecovery seems actually hastened. After a day or so it is well to remove\r\nthe plaster splint first applied and put on another, as the former has by\r\nthis time usually ceased to fit the injured joint--owing to the\r\ndiminution in the swelling. The splint may be changed three, four, or\r\neven five times, if deemed necessary, though two or three applications\r\ngenerally amply suffice. _This or some other splint should be kept on the\r\ninjured joint for at least a month or six weeks, as otherwise complete\r\nrecovery frequently fails to occur, with the permanent weakening of the\r\njoint as a consequence._\r\n\r\nOf course it is always desirable to have a physician apply the splints\r\nfor a sprain where this is feasible, but with a little care it may be\r\ndone by any intelligent person who will observe closely the directions\r\ngiven. The plaster should be put on moderately tight, but the utmost care\r\nmust be exercised in not carrying this to an extreme, as in such cases\r\nserious results might ensue. In order that it may be determined as to\r\nwhether or not the splint is too tight, it is advisable to watch the\r\npatient's toes for some hours after the plaster is put on, and should\r\nthey be found to be very cold, and particularly should they begin to show\r\na dusky discoloration, it is evidence that the strips are exerting too\r\nmuch pressure, and they should be at once removed. Under such\r\ncircumstances, in a half an hour or so, the splint could be reapplied\r\nwith safety.\r\n\r\nThe mole-skin plaster, which is used in making the splint just referred\r\nto, may be obtained in rolls of any width from all druggists; and as the\r\nplaster keeps practically indefinitely, it should be in the\r\nmedicine-closet of everyone living at a distance from skilled medical\r\naid.\r\n\r\nAfter a sprained ankle the patient should wear shoes that come well up\r\nabove the injured joint, and they should be laced tightly until some time\r\nafter all symptoms of trouble have disappeared; it would be on the safe\r\nside to wear shoes of this kind from six months to a year, depending upon\r\nthe severity of the injury.\r\n\r\n_Treating Bruises._--Bruises are not usually followed by serious\r\nconsequences if properly treated. They result from injuries that tear\r\nthe tissues beneath the skin to such a degree that hemorrhage from many\r\nminute blood-vessels occurs in the injured part. In the course of a few\r\nhours they often present a truly alarming appearance, being swollen and\r\ngreatly discolored, but they are not as a rule followed by any permanent\r\nill results. Where bruises are slight no treatment of any kind is\r\nrequired, as in a short time the effused blood is absorbed, and the part\r\nreturns to a normal condition. Where more severe it is not a bad practice\r\nto cover them with flannels wrung out from hot water, the same being\r\nrenewed from time to time, and the applications kept up for from six to\r\ntwelve hours. Usually at the end of this time the soreness and swelling\r\nwill have considerably abated, and the injured tissues quickly return to\r\na normal condition.\r\n\r\n_The reader should be warned that under no circumstances should the skin\r\nbe opened, even though it may be quite obvious that there is a bluish\r\nmass of blood immediately beneath._ Where this mistake is made, infection\r\nof the injured tissues with the germs that produce pus inevitably\r\nresults, and as a consequence the patient suffers with a discharging\r\nwound for a considerable period of time. In rare cases germs get into the\r\ninjured parts without the skin having been opened, and there results\r\nunder such circumstances a condition which closely resembles that of an\r\nordinary abscess. The probability that this undesirable complication has\r\narisen is shown by the swelling becoming greater and more painful some\r\ndays after the injury has occurred, and under such circumstances a good\r\nphysician should be at once consulted, as it will be necessary to make an\r\nincision into the diseased area.\r\n\r\n_Soothing Burns._--One of the most common and painful of injuries are\r\nburns. Small superficial burns require no particular treatment. Where,\r\nhowever, they are of sufficient severity to merit attention, the simplest\r\nand best of all treatments is to immerse the diseased part in cold water,\r\nand here it should remain at least some hours, or until competent medical\r\naid can be secured. Medical treatment of injuries of this kind is not\r\nparticularly satisfactory, though there are some drugs that may be used\r\nwith more or less benefit. Chief among them is picric acid, which may be\r\napplied by means of a cloth wrung out of a one per cent. solution of this\r\nsubstance in water. Another treatment which has some merit, and which has\r\nlong enjoyed a certain vogue among both medical men and the laity, is a\r\ncombination of equal parts of lime-water with either olive or linseed\r\noil; this is called carron oil and is applied in the same way as the\r\npicric acid solution. All three of the remedies referred to act largely\r\nby preventing the access of air to the burned surface, and they,\r\ntherefore, may be replaced by any bland and non-poisonous substance which\r\naccomplishes like results.\r\n\r\n_Accidents from Heat and Cold._--The climate of the United States is\r\ncharacterized by extreme variations--there being over almost its entire\r\nextent during the winter months a series of \"cold waves,\" during which\r\nexcessively low temperatures are often experienced,--particularly in the\r\nnorthern and western portions of the country. During the summer, on the\r\nother hand, we have almost everywhere periods during which the\r\ntemperature goes very high--often accompanied by excessive atmospheric\r\nmoisture. As a consequence of these extremes in temperature it could only\r\nbe expected that we would often experience bad effects, so that serious\r\nillness, and even death, occasionally result.\r\n\r\nOf the two extremes, excessive heat is much the more dangerous, and is by\r\nfar more frequently followed by fatal results--particularly in crowded\r\ncities. Fortunately for the dwellers in rural districts the precise\r\nconditions under which excessive heat is followed by serious consequences\r\nare not so frequently encountered as in the more populous centers, and as\r\na result we find that serious ill effects from high temperatures are by\r\nno means so common in the former as in the latter. There are, however,\r\ntwo quite well defined and distinct morbid conditions that are the result\r\nof high temperatures, and inasmuch as they differ in their symptoms as\r\nwell as in their treatment, it will be necessary to consider them\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n_Sunstroke._--Sunstroke is characterized by a rapid onset, the patient\r\nusually complaining of an uncomfortable sense of burning heat and a\r\nfeeling of dizziness and depression. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea are\r\ncommon, frequently an intense headache, and sooner or later a muttering\r\ndelirium. The patient's skin is dry and hot, the face is flushed, and the\r\neyes suffused, and a thermometer will show a bodily temperature of from\r\n105° to 110° or even 112°F. In fatal cases it is usually some hours\r\nbefore the patient dies, though sometimes he succumbs almost instantly.\r\n\r\nWhen attacked, the patient should at once be removed to some shady place,\r\nand should be held in a sitting posture against any suitable object that\r\nmay be at hand. The clothing should be loosened at once, and every\r\nendeavor should be directed towards lowering the temperature of the\r\nvictim. This is best done by pouring ice-water or the coolest water that\r\ncan be secured freely over the entire body of the patient. This treatment\r\nshould be continued until the temperature approaches the normal--the\r\nvigor of the measure employed gradually decreasing, as the patient shows\r\nsigns of getting better. Improvement is shown by a gradual return of\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\n_Heat-Prostration._--Like true sunstroke, heat-prostration comes on with\r\nan extreme suddenness. The patient becomes suddenly dizzy, and sinks to\r\nthe ground in a state of collapse. The skin is pale and cool, the pulse\r\nlimp and weak, and the thermometer shows the temperature to be somewhat\r\nbelow normal. The patient should be laid on the ground in a cool, shady\r\nplace, and stimulants at once given. By far the most efficient of them is\r\na hypodermic injection of morphine and atropine, to which strychnine in\r\nappropriate doses may be added.\r\n\r\n_Guarding against Sunstroke and Heat-Prostration._--Excessive heat is the\r\nbasis of both of these conditions, but there are many contributing causes\r\nwhich play a more or less important part in their production.\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that they are regarded as being different, and\r\nthat the treatment and symptoms of the two conditions vary widely, there\r\ncan be no doubt that certain depressing influences, in every way similar,\r\nplay an important part in their causation.\r\n\r\n     Foremost among such influences alcohol claims first place, and\r\n     unquestionably not only predisposes to all diseases brought on by\r\n     heat, but lends much greater gravity to an attack--the drunkard\r\n     rarely recovering from true sunstroke, and frequently dying from\r\n     the much less dangerous heat-prostration. It is said that the\r\n     latter condition is particularly prone to occur after freely\r\n     indulging in beer or other malt liquors. Not only does alcohol\r\n     predispose to these morbid states, but other influences that\r\n     depress the general vitality are more or less apt to predispose to\r\n     the production of both, such as loss of sleep, overwork, worry,\r\n     excessive eating, and insufficient food. The danger is greater when\r\n     there is excessive moisture in the air, so that at such times we\r\n     should particularly avoid excesses of all kinds, and as far as\r\n     possible, keep out of the direct rays of the sun.\r\n\r\n_Frost-bite._--In the extreme northern and northwestern portions of the\r\nUnited States frost-bite is not uncommon in winter. The part attacked\r\nbecomes suddenly bloodless, presenting much the appearance of the skin\r\nafter death. The victim is usually not aware of the fact as at first\r\nthere is no pain. As soon as a condition of this kind is observed,--and\r\nin cold countries persons are quick to inform the victim when they notice\r\nit,--the place should be vigorously rubbed with a piece of ice, or with a\r\nhandful of snow, and this should be continued until the circulation again\r\nreturns as evidenced by the parts becoming reddened. A rapid warming of\r\nthe affected parts is not advisable, the result being not unlike that of\r\na burn.\r\n\r\n_Chilblains._--Many persons suffer during the winter from\r\nchilblains--this being a state in which more or less pain and itching is\r\nproduced in a part as the result of poor circulation. Such a condition is\r\nusually the result of a combination of cold with the affected part being\r\nmore or less compressed, and as a consequence, we find that troubles of\r\nthis kind are more frequently in the feet--particularly where tight shoes\r\nare worn. The remedy for troubles of this character is to wear\r\nloose-fitting shoes, and to thoroughly protect the parts by appropriate\r\nwoolen socks. It is particularly of importance to change the socks often,\r\nsince as soon as they become moistened with perspiration a tendency to a\r\nrecurrence of the trouble is very great. Drugs are of no particular use\r\nin conditions of this kind. Chilblains are more commonly suffered in\r\nEurope than in America. One young American lady in Paris acquired them\r\none winter, and \"knowing no better,\" as she told the writer, cured\r\nherself by \"boiling the chilblains\"--soaking her feet in the hottest\r\nwater she could endure. The affliction did not return; and the novel\r\nrecipe was delightedly followed by all the art-students of the\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\n_Blisters._--Small blisters on the feet are not uncommon as the result of\r\nwearing tight, or ill-fitting shoes. Wherever possible, they should be\r\nquickly relieved from all compression, and should under no circumstances\r\nbe opened.\r\n\r\n     The treatment is very simple and quite efficient, provided it be\r\n     instituted while the skin is still intact, and consists simply in\r\n     placing over the affected area a small piece of mole-skin plaster,\r\n     which should extend for a short distance out on the normal skin\r\n     surrounding the blister; the same sort of plaster should here be\r\n     used as was recommended for supporting sprained joints, and is an\r\n     article so useful that it should be kept in every house. Where\r\n     blisters have ruptured, the better plan is to apply some\r\n     antiseptic, like tincture of iodine, and after having allowed it to\r\n     dry, stick on some plaster as already directed. If no antiseptic be\r\n     at hand the plaster should be used any way, but it should be\r\n     frequently removed in order to see that no suppuration is occurring\r\n     beneath. Small blisters, the result of burns, may be treated in a\r\n     similar way with good results.\r\n\r\n_Tooth-ache._--Tooth-ache is a condition for which there is no excuse in\r\nthe present state of knowledge. As soon as decay begins in a tooth it\r\nshould receive the attention of a competent dentist, and where this is\r\ndone a true tooth-ache never occurs. Where one has been so neglectful as\r\nto permit the exposure of the nerve of a tooth, he can only be saved from\r\nmuch suffering by going at once to a dentist. In the meantime, various\r\nmeasures may be adopted to diminish the pain. A piece of cotton dipped in\r\ndilute carbolic acid and thrust into the cavity will almost immediately\r\nrelieve the suffering for the time being. Oil of cloves, or a mixture of\r\nthis substance with chloroform, applied in a similar way will bring about\r\na like result. The reader cannot be too often reminded of the fact that\r\nbad teeth not only cause much suffering, but likewise lead to many\r\ndigestive disturbances, and as a consequence little could be of more\r\nimportance to the health of the body than to see to it that they be kept\r\nin perfect order. Where teeth are knocked out, they will often grow back\r\nand render good service for many years afterwards if replaced\r\nimmediately in their sockets.\r\n\r\n_Bites of Animals._--Wounds of this character, particularly those\r\nproduced by dogs and cats, are not at all uncommon. Where it is\r\ndefinitely known that the animal is not rabid, the treatment should be\r\nthat of punctured wounds,--to the chapter on which the reader is referred\r\nfor further information.\r\n\r\nWhere there is reason to suspect that the animal has hydrophobia, it\r\nshould be, if possible, at once confined, and watched for developments.\r\nUnder no circumstances should it be killed. If the animal is rabid, it\r\nwill be unable to eat or drink, and will die in the course of a few days;\r\nshould it survive not the least fear need be felt as to it having had\r\nhydrophobia, as no instance is on record where the disease was followed\r\nby recovery. For further information on this subject, the reader is\r\nreferred to the special article on hydrophobia (page 211).\r\n\r\n_Hiccough._--Hiccough is a condition caused by a spasm of the diaphragm.\r\nAll methods for the relief of this somewhat annoying condition are based\r\nupon the idea of having the patient hold his breath as long as is\r\npossible. The remedy is best applied by the sufferer holding his breath\r\nand leaning as far backward as is possible, and in the meanwhile\r\ndistracting the attention by pointing the index finger of one hand\r\ntowards the nose, and bringing the former toward the latter as slowly as\r\nis possible. Sticking the tongue out and holding the breath at the same\r\ntime will often relieve hiccough, or if the victim can be induced to\r\nsneeze the distressing symptom will at once cease. The _slow_ swallowing\r\nof a few sips of water will frequently put an end to the trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nWHAT TO DO WHEN POISONED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of cases of poisoning occur in children, and are,\r\nalmost without exception, due to carelessness of their elders, and\r\ntherefore preventable.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it is recognized that anyone has swallowed a poison of any\r\nkind, a competent physician should be summoned with the utmost haste, and\r\nin the meantime much may be done, in most cases, to minimize the effects\r\nof the substance taken. The patient should at once be urged to drink as\r\nmuch water as is possible, in order that the poison may be diluted, and\r\nevery effort should be made to induce vomiting; this may often be brought\r\nabout as soon as the stomach is full of water, by tickling the throat\r\nwith the finger, or with any other object that can be readily introduced\r\nthrough the mouth. As quickly as possible, some warm water should be\r\nsecured, to a quart of which either a teaspoon of salt or mustard should\r\nbe added, and the patient urged to drink until the stomach is thoroughly\r\ndistended; following this, particularly where aided by tickling the\r\nthroat, vomiting may be generally induced, with the effect, of course, of\r\nexpelling a greater or less proportion of the poison from the stomach. If\r\nit be known that the poison is an _acid_, ordinary cooking soda should be\r\nadded to the water that the patient drinks, as in this way all acid\r\nsubstances are at once neutralized.\r\n\r\nIf the patient has taken an _alkaline_ poison, he should immediately be\r\ngiven diluted vinegar, or water into which the juice of lemons or oranges\r\nhas been squeezed; such harmless acids neutralize poisonous alkaloids\r\njust as harmless alkalies antidote poisonous acids.\r\n\r\n_Arsenic poisoning_ usually results from the accidental swallowing of\r\nrat-poison or some insecticide, as Paris green, or else some sort of\r\ngreen dye, many of which contain salts of arsenic in some form. An emetic\r\nshould be at once given, to be followed by the whites of several eggs\r\ndissolved in a small amount of water; sweet milk may also be\r\nadministered with benefit.\r\n\r\nAccidental poisoning by _phosphorus_, results usually from children\r\neating the heads of matches, and it is rarely the case that enough of the\r\nsubstance is taken to produce serious results. The poison, however, is a\r\ndeadly one if taken in sufficient quantity, and where it is found that\r\nsubstances containing it have been swallowed the most energetic measures\r\nshould at once be resorted to. Warm water containing mustard or some\r\nother emetic should at once be given, and this should be followed by\r\nwhites of eggs and sweet milk. It is well also to try to get rid of any\r\nof the phosphorus that might remain in the stomach by giving the patient\r\nsome saline purgative like Epsom salts.\r\n\r\nWhere _carbolic acid_ has been taken, the fact can be readily determined\r\nby noting the characteristic smell of this substance on the patient's\r\nbreath, and by observing that the mouth and throat present a more or less\r\nwhitish appearance. The treatment to be of any avail, should be of the\r\nmost energetic character. The patient should at once drink largely of\r\nwater, and vomiting should be induced as quickly as possible. Either\r\nmilk or the white of an egg should then be given. Ordinary quick-lime, or\r\neven plaster from the walls of the house, may be stirred up in water and\r\nadministered to the sufferer, as both have a distinct value in antidoting\r\nthe effects of this poison. Burns of the skin with carbolic acid are\r\nrarely followed by serious consequences. As soon as the accident occurs\r\nthe part should be thoroughly washed with water, and if at hand a little\r\nalcohol may be rubbed over the part; the affected tissues return to a\r\nnormal condition in the course of a short time in the vast majority of\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n_Strychnine poisoning_ is comparatively rare, except when this substance\r\nis given with suicidal or murderous intent. Water should be given,\r\nimmediately followed by an emetic. A mass of crystals of permanganate of\r\npotash as big as a pea may be administered in a glass of water, if this\r\nsubstance be at hand. After the poison has been absorbed nothing is\r\nusually of any avail if the amount was originally sufficient to produce\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest forms of poisoning is from _opium_ in the form of\r\nmorphine, paregoric or laudanum. When this happens the stomach should be\r\nwashed out by water frequently, even where the drug was administered\r\nhypodermatically. This is best accomplished by causing vomiting by warm\r\nwater to which a small amount of mustard has been added. The patient\r\nshould be given strong coffee or tea at frequent intervals, and\r\nartificial respiration should be practiced. Where it is possible to\r\nobtain it, permanganate of potash in a watery solution should be given,\r\nenough of the chemical being used to make the water a deep purple color;\r\nthis may be frequently repeated, as the substance is not poisonous in\r\nordinary doses, and destroys morphine and other alkaloids of opium very\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\n_It should never be forgotten that infants and children are poisoned by\r\ncomparatively very small doses of opium, and consequently nothing\r\ncontaining any derivative of this substance should be given them except\r\non the advice of a competent doctor._\r\n\r\nMany soothing syrups advertised for the relief of the minor ailments of\r\nchildren contain opium, and there can be no doubt that many deaths have\r\noccurred as a consequence of taking such nostrums.\r\n\r\n_Mushroom poisoning_ in this country is relatively rare, but there are\r\nquite a number of popular notions on this subject that are totally\r\nincorrect, chief among which is the idea that there is a difference\r\nbetween mushrooms and toad-stools, the former being generally regarded as\r\nedible, and the latter poisonous. As a matter of fact, those conversant\r\nwith this subject make no distinction between the two, using the terms\r\ntoad-stool and mushroom as interchangeable. It is likewise a common error\r\nto suppose that we possess any tests by which the poisonous toad-stools\r\ncan be told from those that are wholesome. Although a skilled student of\r\nthe subject can almost at a glance determine which are poisonous and\r\nwhich are not, it is hazardous in the extreme to consume those selected\r\nby one who is inexperienced. As a matter of fact, for all practicable\r\npurposes, there is only one species that is generally eaten,--the\r\n_Agaricus campestris_, or meadow mushroom. This grows for the most part\r\nin open fields, and in many parts of the world may be gathered in great\r\nnumber throughout the warmer seasons immediately following rains. This\r\nmushroom has also the great advantage that it is the only one of the\r\nedible species that can be cultivated.\r\n\r\nJust as we have only one common mushroom that is ordinarily eaten, there\r\nis only one common species of these plants that is highly dangerous,--the\r\n_Amanita phalloides_, which contains one of the most deadly poisons\r\nknown--and one for which we possess no adequate antidote. This mushroom\r\nis very common, being frequently seen along the roadside, and at the\r\nedges of fields; it also grows in forests, and is occasionally\r\nencountered in treeless areas.\r\n\r\n     It presents a rather attractive appearance, being rather large, and\r\n     having a glistening white cap with a long stem, around which there\r\n     may always be seen a distinct collar; on carefully removing the\r\n     soil from around its roots, it will be seen that its stem is\r\n     surrounded just below the surface of the earth by a sheath-like\r\n     structure, the so-called \"death-cup,\" which, together with the\r\n     peculiarities already mentioned, clearly stamp this mushroom as\r\n     being one of the most deadly of all known natural objects. In\r\n     addition to the rather inviting appearance of this toad-stool, its\r\n     flavor is agreeable, thus in every way insidiously inviting, it\r\n     would seem, the unwary to their doom. Less common than the species\r\n     just considered is another closely related fungus known as the\r\n     _Amanita muscarius_, or fly-agaric; this handsome mushroom presents\r\n     the same peculiarities of structure exhibited by the _Amanita\r\n     phalloides_, but differs from it in the fact that the tip of its\r\n     cap is scaly, and is of a reddish-yellow color. The fly-agaric is\r\n     quite as poisonous as its more common relative, and is equally to\r\n     be shunned. The reader should be warned that even handling either\r\n     of the fungi just considered may result in poisonous\r\n     symptoms--probably as a consequence of multitudes of the tiny\r\n     spores of the plants being carried into the nose and mouth by the\r\n     air.\r\n\r\nSome hours after eating the _Amanitas_, the patient is taken with\r\nvomiting, diarrhoea, cramps, and extreme prostration; in children,\r\nconvulsions may occur. Most unfortunately evidences of this poisoning do\r\nnot usually develop until some hours after eating it. As a consequence, a\r\nconsiderable amount of the poison has usually been absorbed into the body\r\nbefore the victim is aware that anything is wrong, and it, therefore,\r\nbecomes impossible, as a rule, to greatly help matters by attempting to\r\nremove the offending material from the stomach by emetics.\r\nNotwithstanding this it would be proper to administer warm water, into\r\nwhich a small amount of mustard had been stirred, in order to assist\r\nnature by washing out of the stomach whatever portions of the fungus\r\nmight remain. When exhaustion begins to appear, it should be combated\r\nwith doses of aromatic spirits of ammonia, and by the external\r\napplication of heat. As it is believed that atropine possesses some\r\nantidotal powers to the poison of the _Amanitas_, this substance should\r\nbe injected hypodermatically in the usual dose as quickly as possible,\r\nand an experienced physician should be called at once.\r\n\r\n_Ivy Poisoning from Touch._--One of the two species of _Rhus_, is\r\nexceedingly common in all portions of the United States, producing a\r\nsevere inflammation of the skin when handled, or even in some persons by\r\nmerely being near the plants or in the smoke of a fire where they are\r\nburning. There are two varieties of the _Rhus toxicodendron_, one being\r\nthe shrub commonly called _poison oak_, and the other a climbing vine\r\ngenerally known by the name of poison ivy. The _Rhus venenata_ grows in\r\nswampy localities all over the United States, and is known as\r\npoison-sumac, swamp dog-wood, poison-elder, and poison dog-wood. About\r\ntwenty-four to forty-eight hours after the exposure, the skin begins to\r\nitch, and this is shortly followed by an inflammation accompanied by the\r\nformation of numerous small blisters, and still later by scaling. It\r\nshould not be forgotten that the berries and other portions of these\r\nplants are poisonous when taken internally, giving rise under such\r\ncircumstances to vertigo, faintness, dilation of the pupils, trembling,\r\nconfusion of the senses, and, in some instances, convulsions. Should it\r\nbe discovered that anyone has been exposed to poisoning by these plants,\r\nthe skin should be washed as quickly as is possible with alcohol, or some\r\nsubstance like whisky that contains it; where this cannot be obtained,\r\nhot water and soap should be liberally applied--the object, in either\r\ncase, being the removal of as much of the poison as is possible. After\r\nthe irritation of the skin has begun, the parts may be bathed in a one\r\nper cent. solution of carbolic acid, to be repeated every few hours, as\r\nthe necessities of the case may demand. Lead-water is also frequently\r\nused with benefit, lime-water also appears to be of use, but the various\r\npowders and salves sold in stores rarely help the patient much. The best\r\nthing after all is soap and water as hot as it can be borne; and\r\nordinarily the itching and inflammation will disappear in four or five\r\ndays, followed by scaling.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENOMOUS SNAKES AND SNAKE BITES.\r\n\r\nMuch popular misapprehension exists on the subject of snakes, both as to\r\nthe results of their bites and the appropriate treatment under such\r\ncircumstances. It is not generally understood that a very large\r\npercentage of our American snakes are entirely harmless--the poisonous\r\nones being decidedly more the exception than the rule.\r\n\r\nWithin the confines of the United States there exist only two families of\r\nvenomous serpents. By far the most numerous are three genera of viperine\r\nsnakes, including the rattlesnakes and moccasins; all of these have a\r\npit-like depression between the nose and eyes, and hence are called\r\n_pit-vipers_. In the southern portion of our country there are two\r\nspecies of a colubrine genus closely related to the dreaded cobra of the\r\nEast, one of them being called the coral-snake or harlequin snake, and\r\nthe other, which occurs in the southwest, is known as the Sonoran\r\ncoral-snake.\r\n\r\nWhile there are three genera of vipers in America, two of them are so\r\nclosely related, and present characteristics that are so similar that the\r\nordinary observer would regard them as being identical, and inasmuch as\r\nthe character of their poison seems in every way similar, for practical\r\npurposes it would seem desirable to include them under one head; in both\r\ngenera, the species have rattles on the tips of their tails, the more\r\ncommon being the ordinary rattlesnakes (genus _Crotalus_), of which there\r\nare twelve species in the United States, and the ground-rattlesnakes\r\n(genus _Sistrurus_), of which there are two species.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the rattlesnakes are the true moccasins, of which\r\nthere are two species, one being the cotton-mouth or water-moccasin\r\n(_Ancistrodon piscivorus_), and the other the highland moccasin,\r\npilot-snake or copper-head, (_Ancistrodon contortrix_).\r\n\r\nThe two species of poisonous colubrine serpents already referred to are\r\nknown respectively as the _Elaps fulvius_, and the _Elaps euryxanthus_,\r\nboth of which occur in the southern portions of the United States. These\r\nsnakes are fortunately of a very mild disposition, and rarely attempt to\r\nbite, even when handled. That their poison is exceedingly deadly is\r\nattested by the fact that out of eight instances where it was known that\r\npersons were bitten by them, six died, and they should, therefore, be\r\nlooked upon as among the most deadly of North American serpents. Mention\r\nshould be made of the fact that there are at least six harmless reptiles\r\nthat resemble the coral-snakes very closely, and as a consequence of the\r\nformer being mistaken for the latter, the assertion has been frequently\r\nmade by the ignorant that our elapine serpents are harmless.\r\n\r\nA short description of the really deadly reptiles encountered in this\r\ncountry that would enable even the novice to distinguish them from those\r\nthat are harmless would seem not inappropriate here, for where a person\r\nis bitten by a snake it becomes at once a matter of vital importance to\r\ndetermine, if possible, its true character. Most non-venomous serpents\r\nwill viciously bite when cornered, and while they may produce slight\r\nwounds, with a small amount of bleeding, such injuries are entirely\r\ndevoid of danger, and need occasion no fear on the part of the victim.\r\nThere now follows a brief description of our venomous snakes, by means of\r\nwhich it will be easy for any one to distinguish them from their innocent\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\n_True Rattlesnakes._--There are twelve species of these reptiles in the\r\nUnited States, all of which, with but two exceptions, live west of the\r\nMississippi. They vary very greatly in color, but the common eastern\r\nforms generally have alternate transverse yellow and brownish-black marks\r\nover their bodies. All possess rattles. The body of the snake is thick in\r\nproportion to its length, and the head, which is more or less\r\ndiamond-shaped, is much larger than, and is quite distinct from the neck.\r\nThe pupils of the eye are elliptical--a peculiarity which the pit-vipers\r\nalone possess of all the North American snakes. Between the eye and nose\r\nthere is a comparatively deep depression or pit which gives to this group\r\nof snakes their name. There are two large, exceedingly sharp fangs in the\r\nfront of the mouth, in the position of a dog's canine teeth, that are\r\nfolded up against the roof of the mouth when the snake is in\r\nrepose;--being brought forward in a position for stabbing as the serpent\r\nstrikes. The scales on the under surface of the body back of the anus do\r\nnot divide along the middle line into two rows, as in harmless snakes.\r\n\r\n_Ground Rattlesnakes._--There are two species of the pygmy or\r\nground-rattlesnakes. They attain to a length of only about twenty inches,\r\nand present the general characteristics of the true rattlesnakes, with\r\nthe exception that the rattle is small, consisting of but one single\r\nbutton at the end of the tail. These serpents are exceedingly vicious,\r\nand usually bite without warning. Contrary to the general opinion,\r\nhowever, the wounds they inflict are rarely, or never, followed by\r\nserious consequences in man. One species is southern. The other occurs\r\nfrom Ohio to Nebraska, where it is called massasauga.\r\n\r\n_Cotton-Mouth Moccasin._--The largest specimens of the cotton-mouth\r\nmoccasin attain to a length of about six feet. The full grown reptile is\r\nof a dingy brownish-black color, but the young are pinkish, with coppery\r\nbands running transversely across the body. With the exception that this\r\nreptile has no rattles, it answers in its general peculiarities to the\r\ndescription already given of its near relatives the rattlesnakes. The\r\ncotton-mouth moccasin is semi-aquatic, being found around the edges of\r\nstreams and other bodies of water.\r\n\r\n_The Copper-head, or Highland Moccasin._--This serpent is found from\r\nFlorida and Illinois to southern Massachusetts; also in parts of Texas.\r\nThe largest specimens have a length of about three feet. They resemble\r\nthe cotton-mouth moccasin in their general peculiarities, being, however,\r\nsomewhat lighter in color. The head has a coppery tinge, from which the\r\nsnake gets its name, while the body is of a brownish color, with\r\ntransverse Y-shaped bands of reddish-brown. Its favorite habitat is rocky\r\nhill-sides and the banks of mountain water-courses.\r\n\r\n_Coral-snakes._--The two coral-snakes resemble each other very closely,\r\nand are long slender serpents, whose heads are quite small, and scarcely\r\ndifferentiated from their bodies. The pupils are round, and the head has\r\nno pits. They possess two short permanently erect fangs, which are by no\r\nmeans so well developed as those of the viperine reptiles--though perhaps\r\ncapable of inflicting more deadly wounds than any of the latter,--with\r\nthe possible exception of the diamond-back rattlesnake of the extreme\r\nsouthern portion of the country. Their coloration is exceedingly\r\nbeautiful, and when properly interpreted, entirely characteristic. From\r\nthe head to the tail their skins exhibit alternate rings, or encircling\r\nbands of black, red and yellow--each band of the two former colors being\r\nbordered by yellow; _in other words there are as many yellow stripes as\r\nthere are both black and red together._ Stress is laid upon the\r\ncharacteristics just mentioned, for the reason that half a dozen species\r\nof harmless serpents that greatly resemble them may, without exception,\r\nbe differentiated from the true coral-snakes by the fact that there are\r\nas many _black bands as both red and yellow_. Where a snake has been\r\nkilled, it is of course quite easy to determine whether or not it is\r\nvenomous by a search for the fangs, which are never present in the\r\nnon-poisonous reptiles. Fortunately, the coral-snakes are only found in\r\nthe extreme southern portion of the United States, live under ground for\r\nthe most part, and are rarely encountered.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of Snake-Bite._--As soon as a person has been bitten by a\r\npoisonous serpent, a tight bandage, or ligature of any kind, should be\r\napplied above the wound if the injury has been received on any of the\r\nextremities,--which is fortunately the case in the vast majority of\r\ninstances. The part bitten should be at once exposed, and search made for\r\nthe point of entrance of the fangs. It should be particularly noted as to\r\nwhether there are one or two wounds, as it is true in about one-half of\r\nthe cases that only one fang enters the flesh,--in which case, of course,\r\nthe probabilities of serious consequences resulting are largely\r\ndiminished. With a pocket-knife or other sharp instrument the wound\r\nshould be enlarged, and, if possible, someone should be persuaded to suck\r\nthe wound; this should not be done by one with decayed teeth, as under\r\nsuch circumstances the poison might be absorbed and produce unpleasant\r\nconsequences. A doctor should be summoned as quickly as is possible, but\r\nit must be confessed that in the present state of knowledge, unless he\r\nshould happen to possess--which he probably will not--some antitoxin for\r\nthe particular snake doing the damage, his services will likely be of no\r\ngreat value.\r\n\r\n     It has been asserted by some that very large doses of strychnine\r\n     are directly antidotal to snake venom, but more recent experience\r\n     does not tend to confirm this view; still there is no harm in\r\n     making the trial, and if the services of someone capable of giving\r\n     the injections can be secured, the treatment is certainly worth the\r\n     trial. The immediate injection into the tissues around the wound of\r\n     a one-per-cent. watery solution of chromic acid or potassium\r\n     permanganate is thought to be of value by destroying the poison,\r\n     but in order to be efficient it must be administered within a short\r\n     time after the bite has been received. Should the patient's\r\n     condition become serious, and the breathing finally stop,\r\n     artificial respiration may be resorted to. As soon as the remedies\r\n     suggested have been tried, it is time for us to go back to the\r\n     ligature, which cannot be suffered to remain around the limb\r\n     indefinitely, as by cutting off the blood-supply it will sooner or\r\n     later produce death of the tissues. From time to time we should\r\n     slowly loosen the bandage, thus allowing a little of the poison to\r\n     pass into the body, and at the same time permit the entrance of a\r\n     small quantity of blood into the tissues of the limb beyond the\r\n     ligature; the bandage should of course be tightened at the end of a\r\n     half a minute, and it should be alternately loosened and tightened\r\n     every half hour until the patient is considered to be out of\r\n     danger.\r\n\r\nThe reader cannot fail to have observed that nothing has been said\r\nconcerning the use of alcohol in the treatment of snake-bite, and the\r\nmatter is only here referred to for the purpose of condemning it as being\r\nunsound in theory and bad in practice.\r\n\r\n     The idea that this drug is of value in snake bite doubtless\r\n     originally arose from the fact that those bitten by poisonous\r\n     serpents were depressed, and, as in the past alcohol was considered\r\n     the best of all stimulants, it is not surprising that its use was\r\n     generally considered to be essential. As we now know, however, that\r\n     alcohol is a depressant rather than a stimulant, and as numerous\r\n     experiments carried out on animals have clearly shown that it does\r\n     harm in snake bite rather than good, there is every reason why we\r\n     should cease to endanger the lives of those already poisoned by\r\n     adding to the trouble by using this drug. There is but little doubt\r\n     that many more persons have been killed by the alcoholic treatment\r\n     for snake bites than have died from the effects of snake venom.\r\n     Inasmuch as there is a deep-rooted superstition among most people\r\n     that alcohol is the panacea for snake bite--and such notions die\r\n     hard--it may be well to say that all of the authenticated cases of\r\n     this character that have occurred in this country have recently\r\n     been collected, with the result that it was shown that only about\r\n     one man in ten dies who is bitten by a venomous serpent, and it is,\r\n     therefore, quite easy to understand why alcohol has maintained its\r\n     reputation as being an antidote in such cases--the chances being\r\n     nine to one in the victim's favor without any treatment whatever.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the patient's needs are attended to, it is well to find if the\r\nsnake that inflicted the wound was killed, and an examination of it\r\nshould at once be made as by determining the size and character of the\r\nreptile an accurate forecast to the probable results may be made. In many\r\ninstances it will be found that the snake was not venomous, it having\r\nmade only a few scratches which are of no more consequence than the prick\r\nof a brier. If it be found that the serpent inflicting the wound belongs\r\nto one of the groups already referred to, the probabilities of a serious\r\nresult will depend upon the size and character of the snake, and also to\r\na considerable degree on whether one or both fangs entered the victim's\r\nbody. A full grown diamond-back rattlesnake, which may attain the extreme\r\nlength of eight feet, is perhaps the most dangerous of all the American\r\npoisonous reptiles, though a fully grown coral-snake may be regarded as\r\nalmost, if not quite as, deadly. Next to these a large sized cotton-mouth\r\nmoccasin is perhaps most to be dreaded, to be followed, depending upon\r\ntheir size, by the other varieties of rattlesnakes, the copperheads, and\r\nfinally the ground-rattler. The larger the serpent inflicting the wound\r\nthe greater is the result to be dreaded; naturally it also follows that\r\nthe larger the individual bitten the less the danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nRECIPES FOR COOKING COMMON FOODS\r\n\r\nBy DR. MARY E. LAPHAM\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF MEATS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Roast Beef._--The problem of roasting beef is to have it sufficiently\r\ncooked in the center without hardening and over-cooking the outside.\r\nBurned edges and a raw center testify to a lack of intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe English way of baking beef is to allow nine minutes to the pound for\r\na rib-roast and eight minutes for a sirloin. Sprinkle pepper and salt\r\nover the meat and sprinkle with flour. Pour a little boiling water into\r\nthe pan and bake in an oven hot enough to crisp and brown peeled raw\r\npotatoes cooked in the same pan. Do not forget to baste often. This\r\nmethod gives a rich flavor to the beef and the gravy, but the outside is\r\napt to be cooked too hard while the inside is not enough cooked. Too hot\r\na fire tends to make meat tough and dry.\r\n\r\nThe French have a safer way, especially for small roasts. The beef is\r\ncooked in a cool oven--so cool that a peeled, raw potato will cook tender\r\nwithout browning. Allow about an hour and a quarter for a four-pound\r\nrib-roast. In this way the heat penetrates to the center without\r\nhardening the outside. When properly done the outside is very little more\r\ncooked than the inside, and the roast throughout is tender, rare, and\r\njuicy, with no hard-burned edges. This way of baking makes inferior beef\r\nmore tender and juicy than the English way. It has the disadvantage of\r\nnot leaving any gravy in the pan. When baked after the English method the\r\nfat fries out into the pan, and a delicious, rich, brown gravy may be\r\nmade by adding flour and water. Strain the juice through a fine sieve and\r\nallow to stand a few minutes so as to be able to skim or pour off all the\r\ngrease. Do not serve gravies with half an inch of pure grease on top. It\r\ndoes not require a scientific education nor a herculean effort to remove\r\nthe grease.\r\n\r\n_Pot Roast._--If the beef is of an inferior quality, the best way to cook\r\nit is in a heavy iron kettle, preferably with a sloping bottom. Sprinkle\r\nthe meat with salt and pepper; place a little fat in the bottom of the\r\nkettle--enough to keep the meat from sticking--and allow the roast to\r\nbrown slowly for half an hour. Now put a pint of boiling water in the\r\npot. Cover very closely and let it simmer on the back of the stove for\r\nabout four hours, adding small quantities of hot water as necessary, and\r\nturning often. When cooked take up the meat; skim the fat from the gravy\r\nand thicken with flour.\r\n\r\n_Hamburg Steaks._--Another way of preparing inferior cuts of beef is to\r\nmake Hamburg steaks. Chop the meat in fine pieces. Season with salt,\r\npepper and a little onion juice, and shape into thin cakes. Put three or\r\nfour slices of fat salt pork into a frying-pan, and when brown remove it\r\nand place the steaks in the fat. Fry four minutes; turn, and fry three\r\nmore, and serve on a hot platter. Put a tablespoonful of flour into the\r\nfat and stir until brown. Gradually add a cupful of water or preferably\r\nmilk and boil three minutes; season well, pour over the meat, and serve\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n_Broiled Beef._--Broiling is the simplest, easiest, and most delicious\r\nmethod of cooking meats, but, as a rule, ignorance instinctively turns to\r\nthe frying-pan, and broiling is unknown in many homes. This is partly due\r\nto not knowing how to manage the fire. It seems so much easier to fry on\r\ntop of the stove than to plan beforehand an adequate preparation of the\r\ncoals. It is necessary to have a bed of clear, hot coals with no smoke.\r\nHave the steak cut three-quarters of an inch thick; place in a wire\r\nbroiler; put over the coals and cover with a baking-pan. Turn every\r\nminute or two until the meat is sufficiently cooked. When done, place on\r\na hot platter, and season well with salt, pepper, and butter. Serve\r\nimmediately. It should take about ten minutes to cook a steak or thick\r\nmutton chop.\r\n\r\n_Fried Beef._--If beef must be fried, have a hot fire; heat a thick iron\r\nfrying-pan and grease it just enough to keep the meat from sticking. Have\r\nthe meat three-quarters of an inch thick; place in the hot pan and turn\r\nas soon as it is well seared. Turn often until done and then season well\r\nand serve at once. There should be no gravy in the pan; all the juices\r\nshould be in the meat.\r\n\r\n_Beef Hash._--Take equal parts of beef and cold potatoes, chopped\r\nmoderately fine. Chop a small onion and fry in plenty of butter until\r\nbrown; add the meat and potatoes and just enough milk to keep from\r\nsticking. Cook for half an hour, stirring frequently. Serve with thin,\r\ndry toast or toasted crackers. Poached eggs are a very nice addition.\r\n\r\n_Veal._--Veal, when properly cooked, is delicious and delicate. Like pork\r\nit should be cooked slowly for a long time to develop its full flavor.\r\nUnfortunately it is usually half-cooked, tough, and insipid. The\r\nhousewife who can cook veal properly has a distinct advantage over her\r\nless fortunate neighbor.\r\n\r\n_Leg Roast of Veal._--Take out the bone and fill the space with stuffing\r\nmade as follows: Take one half-cupful of chopped fat pork, or unsmoked\r\nbacon, and fry with a finely chopped onion until delicately brown. Add\r\ntwo cupfuls of bread crumbs; season with salt and pepper and moisten with\r\na little milk. Tie the veal closely; sprinkle with pepper and salt; rub\r\nthoroughly with flour and cover with buttered paper. Into the baking-pan\r\nput a generous number of thin slices of unsmoked bacon, an onion and half\r\na can of tomatoes. Add just enough boiling water to steam the veal. Cook\r\ngently in a moderate oven, allowing twenty-five minutes to the pound, and\r\nbaste very frequently, turning the meat about every half-hour. When done,\r\nput it on a hot platter in the warming oven, and add enough water to make\r\nthe requisite amount of gravy. Thicken with browned flour, strain, and\r\npour over the roast.\r\n\r\n_Fried Veal._--Fried veal steak or cutlets are delicious, but very\r\ndifficult to prepare properly. As a usual thing veal cutlets are either\r\nhalf raw, or cooked until dry and hard. When properly cooked veal should\r\nbe spongy, soft, and velvety. The chops should be not quite a half inch\r\nthick. Melt a little lard in a hot frying-pan; sprinkle some salt and\r\npepper on the veal and fry quickly until brown on both sides. Then cover\r\ntightly, and place on the back of the stove and steam until thoroughly\r\ntender. It requires from forty to forty-five minutes to fry veal.\r\n\r\n_Broiled Veal._--The veal should be cut thin, broiled quickly until\r\nbrown, and seasoned with salt, pepper, and melted butter, to which a\r\nlittle chopped parsley and lemon juice have been added. Serve on a hot\r\nplatter and eat at once. If the veal is fat, tender and nicely broiled,\r\nit is almost as good as game.\r\n\r\n_Veal Stew or Pot-pie._--Cut the meat from a knuckle of veal into pieces\r\nnot too small; put them into a pot with some small pieces of salt pork,\r\nand plenty of pepper and salt; pour over enough hot water to cover it\r\nwell, and boil until the meat is thoroughly done. While the water is\r\nstill boiling drop in, by the spoonful, a batter made as follows: Two\r\neggs well beaten, two and a half or three cupfuls of buttermilk, one even\r\nteaspoonful of soda, and flour enough to make a thick batter. Cover the\r\npot, and as soon as the batter is well cooked serve it.\r\n\r\n_Veal Stew._--This is an exceedingly nutritious, economical, and\r\nappetizing dish. Cut the veal into small pieces about an inch square; add\r\nthree or four thin slices of salt pork; one or two onions and potatoes\r\ncut up fine, and a little turnip, carrot, parsley and celery, if you have\r\nthem. Cover well with boiling water and cook over a brisk fire until the\r\nmeat is tender and the water pretty well cooked away. This will require\r\nabout an hour. Cover the meat well with fresh milk; season to taste with\r\npepper, salt, and a generous quantity of butter; let the mess simmer on\r\nthe back of the stove about twenty minutes, and serve it in a hot covered\r\ndish.\r\n\r\n_Jellied Veal._--Jellied veal gives the impression of an expensive\r\npreparation, and yet nothing is cheaper or simpler. Put a knuckle of veal\r\ninto a pot that can be tightly covered; season well with two or three\r\nslices of unsmoked bacon, the heart of an onion, salt, pepper and a\r\nlittle butter, adding just enough water to steam the meat thoroughly\r\n(replenishing it from time to time as needed), and cook over a slow fire\r\nuntil tender--probably about four hours. When done there should be about\r\ntwo teacupfuls of broth. Prepare three cold hard-boiled eggs. Cut the\r\nveal into pieces the size of a walnut. Now choose a dish just large\r\nenough to hold the meat, the eggs and the broth. Slice the eggs and place\r\na few pieces on the bottom of the dish. Now put in a layer of veal; then\r\nmore egg and continue in this way until the veal is used. Strain the\r\nbroth over the veal and set it away in a cool place, preferably on ice,\r\nuntil quite firm. When about to serve it, loosen by slipping a knife,\r\nwarmed in water, between the meat and the dish. Garnish with parsley or\r\nlettuce, and serve with salad of any kind.\r\n\r\n_Roast Pork._--Pork should be thoroughly cooked in a medium hot oven. For\r\nthe leg or the shoulder allow twenty-five minutes to the pound. For the\r\nspareribs allow fifteen minutes. Sprinkle the spareribs well with salt,\r\npepper, sage, and a little chopped onion, or bake a few onions in the\r\nsame dish. Put a little water in the pan and add to it as it cooks away.\r\nThe leg, the loin, and the shoulder may be stuffed with well-seasoned\r\nsage stuffing. To make this, cut a few strips of fat pork into small dice\r\nand fry over a slow fire. Add a finely chopped onion and cook until\r\nbrown. Crumble as many slices of dry bread as you will need, and fry with\r\nthe onion and pork over a slow fire until nicely browned. Moisten a\r\nlittle with milk or cream, and fill the space left by removing the bones.\r\nSew tightly together and bake thoroughly. Peeled, raw potatoes are very\r\nnice baked in the same dish with the pork. A medium sized potato will\r\nrequire a little over an hour to bake in a moderate oven. Apple sauce,\r\nsauerkraut, or cabbage cooked with a little vinegar, are nice to serve\r\nwith pork.\r\n\r\n_Broiled Pork._--Very thin slices cut from a leg of pork, or the cutlets,\r\nor the chops, are extremely nice and delicate when broiled. They must be\r\ncut thin; the coals must be bright and hot; and the meat turned very\r\noften. Serve on a hot platter.\r\n\r\n_Fried Pork._--For frying, pork should not be cut over a half an inch\r\nthick: Cook slowly from forty minutes to an hour, with the pan closely\r\ncovered, to keep in the steam. Pork requires a long, slow process to\r\ndevelop its flavor and tenderness. Nearly everyone cooks it too fast, and\r\nfor too short a time. When thoroughly steamed and nicely seasoned with\r\nsalt, pepper, sage and a little onion, well fed pork is as toothsome and\r\ndainty as turkey. Make a brown gravy and pour over the meat. Serve with\r\napple sauce.\r\n\r\n_Boiled Pork._--Take a leg of pork, or a shoulder, and remove the bones.\r\nTie closely together and let it cook slowly in a tightly covered pot for\r\nhalf an hour, adding a little fat if necessary to keep the meat from\r\nsticking. Now sprinkle with salt, pepper and sage. Put two whole onions\r\nin the pot, and just enough boiling water to thoroughly steam the meat.\r\nPlace it on the back of the stove and cook over a slow fire for four or\r\nfive hours until thoroughly tender and velvety. When done put on a hot\r\nplatter in the warming-oven. Thicken the gravy with flour, adding a\r\nlittle water or milk if necessary, then let it boil for five minutes and\r\nstrain. When properly cooked this is delicious cold, and almost as good\r\nfor salad as chicken or turkey. If desired, peeled raw potatoes may be\r\nbrowned in the pot with the meat. These will take about an hour to cook.\r\n\r\n_Curing Ham and Bacon._--To have good ham and bacon the meat must first\r\nbe properly cured so that the lean part is pink, tender and soft to the\r\ntouch, while the fat is clear and white. In many country homes the lean\r\nmeat is about as tough, hard, and indigestible as sole leather. A good\r\nrecipe for curing is as follows: For every gallon of water take two\r\npounds of coarse salt and one-half ounce of soda. Boil all together and\r\nskim well, and, while hot, pour over the meat. Put in a cold dry place\r\nwith a stone to keep the meat well below the water. After three weeks,\r\nhang the meat and let it dry for two or three days before smoking.\r\n\r\n_Broiled Ham._--Nothing is more appetizing for supper than broiled ham,\r\nserved with mashed potatoes, milk toast, or a poached egg on dry toast.\r\nCut the ham as thin as possible, and broil quickly over hot coals,\r\nturning constantly until the fat begins to shrivel. Have everything else\r\nready so that it can be eaten immediately. Cold cabbage salad is nice\r\nwith this.\r\n\r\n_Boiled Ham._--If quite salty, soak the ham twenty-four hours. Put it in\r\na large kettle with a generous supply of water, and allow twenty-five\r\nminutes to the pound for boiling. Take the pot from the fire and let the\r\nmeat remain in the water until nearly cold. Sprinkle with pepper and rub\r\nthoroughly with brown sugar; put the ham and the fat from the liquor into\r\na baking-pan and brown for about an hour in the oven. Cut as thin as\r\npossible when serving.\r\n\r\n_Frying Ham._--Cut the ham in the thinnest possible slices, with a large,\r\nsharp knife. Have the frying-pan hot, and cook the meat just enough to\r\ngive the fat a delicate brown, turning frequently. To cook ham too much\r\nis to make it tough, hard, dry, and indigestible. Put the ham on a hot\r\nplatter in the warming oven. Add a cupful, or more, of fresh milk to the\r\ngrease and thicken with flour. Serve with boiled potatoes. Instead of\r\nmaking a gravy, eggs may be fried in the fat. To do this nicely the fat\r\nmust not be burned. The eggs should be dropped in one by one, allowing\r\nthem plenty of room to spread out. Cook slowly and with a spoon baste the\r\nyolks with the hot fat until they sear, being careful not to cook the egg\r\ntoo hard. These eggs are very nice served on thin, dry toast, or one may\r\nbe placed on each slice of ham.\r\n\r\n_Fried Bacon._--Cut the bacon into very thin slices, and cook in a hot\r\nfrying-pan just long enough to turn the fat to a delicate brown. If\r\ncooked too long it is hard and indigestible, besides losing its delicacy\r\nof flavor. A very nice way to cook bacon, instead of frying it, is to\r\nroll the slices up into curls, skewer them with toothpicks, and place\r\nthem in a baking-pan on the grate of a hot oven until they are slightly\r\nbrown. Serve on dry toast. They should be eaten at once.\r\n\r\n_Broiled Bacon._--Bacon can be broiled like ham. A very nice way to serve\r\nit, especially for an invalid, is to toast it before the fire; split a\r\nhot biscuit and make a sandwich with the bacon. Bacon toasted this way\r\nand eaten when very hot has a peculiarly appetizing flavor.\r\n\r\n_Unsmoked Bacon._--Cut in thin slices; roll in flour or meal; dust\r\nlightly with pepper; fry over a moderately hot fire until delicately\r\nbrown and crisp, and put on a warm platter in the warming closet. Add\r\nsufficient fresh milk to the fat to make the requisite amount of gravy.\r\nSeason with a little salt and pepper, and thicken with flour. Do not pour\r\nover the meat. Serve in separate dish.\r\n\r\n_Boiled Mutton._--Mutton should be cooked very much like beef,--just\r\nenough to leave a faint pink, but not enough to make it hard and develop\r\na strong taste. For boiled mutton allow ten minutes to the pound. Add a\r\nlittle rice to make the meat whiter and tenderer. Cover with boiling\r\nwater and cook rapidly for fifteen minutes; then place on the back of the\r\nstove where it will simmer nicely for two hours. Young turnips, boiled\r\nwith the mutton are a very nice addition.\r\n\r\n_Mutton Cutlets._--The chops should be thick. Grease the bottom of a hot\r\nfrying-pan just enough to keep the chops from sticking; place over a hot\r\nfire, and turn the meat constantly to keep it from burning until the\r\ncenter is a faint pink. Season with salt, pepper, and melted butter to\r\nwhich a little lemon juice and parsley may be added.\r\n\r\n_Roast Mutton._--The French roast mutton in a slow oven in order that the\r\nheat may penetrate to the center without injuring the outside. Allow\r\ntwenty minutes to the pound, or, if a very large roast, twenty-five\r\nminutes may not be too much, providing the oven is not too hot. Season\r\nwith salt and pepper, and put a generous supply of boiling water in the\r\npan. Baste frequently, and turn the meat every half hour. Place two or\r\nthree peeled raw potatoes in the pan, and watch them; if they begin to\r\nbrown, the oven is too hot. The potatoes should keep pace with the\r\nmutton, and when the latter is half done the former should be cooked to\r\nthe same degree.\r\n\r\n_Broiled Mutton Chops._--The chops should be cut an inch thick. Trim off\r\nthe fat and scrape the bones. Roll in a little melted butter or oil, and\r\nbroil over a hot fire, turning constantly until just pink within. Have\r\nready a mound of hot mashed potatoes and lay the chops around it. Pour a\r\nlittle melted butter over them and serve with green peas.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPER COOKING OF CEREALS.\r\n\r\nStarchy foods in any form must be well cooked. Gluey, slimy oatmeal, full\r\nof hard lumps of half-cooked grains, the whole forming a raw, horrid\r\nmass, is very different from the smooth, well cooked, easily digestible,\r\noatmeal prepared by a good cook. Rolled oats are more easily cooked than\r\noatmeal, as they are already prepared. For four people, put a quarter of\r\na teaspoonful of salt into four cups of _hot_ water and stir in slowly\r\none cup of rolled oats, being careful not to allow lumps to form. Cook\r\nfor an hour in a double boiler.\r\n\r\n_Hominy._--Hominy is seldom well cooked. It is often lumpy and raw, and\r\nyet has a burned taste which comes from being cooked in too little water,\r\nwhile if too much is used it goes all to soup and can never be made good.\r\nSalt a quart of boiling water, and very carefully stir into it a cup of\r\nhominy. Stir often and add a little water from time to time if it gets\r\ntoo dry. Cook until every grain is thoroughly done.\r\n\r\n_Rice._--Rice is rarely well prepared, the greatest trouble being to get\r\neach grain well cooked without making it mushy. When properly cooked each\r\ngrain will be firm and distinct, and at the same time soft and tender.\r\nWash half a cupful of rice thoroughly, put it in a quart of boiling\r\nsalted water, and let it boil for half an hour; then drain it thoroughly\r\nand steam it in a colander for an hour.\r\n\r\n_Corn-Bread._--Corn-bread should be something like rice: every particle\r\nthoroughly cooked and soft, and yet not sticking together, so that the\r\ninside is dry and crumbly while the outside is crisp and nutty. The\r\nthinner corn-bread is baked the more perfectly it cooks. It should not be\r\nmore than an inch thick and preferably less. A cannon-ball of raw meal,\r\nwith only the thinnest of surfaces decently baked, is an insult to a\r\nman's intelligence as well as to his digestion. This is the way to\r\nprepare it properly. Sift a teaspoonful of baking powder into a pint of\r\ncorn meal. Mix in a piece of butter the size of a walnut and add sweet\r\nmilk until you get a dough that can be kneaded into a cake. Bake in a hot\r\noven until brown and well done. A little richer corn-bread is made by\r\nheating a pint of sweet milk and pouring it over a pint of corn-meal.\r\nMelt a piece of butter the size of a walnut, beat two eggs, add a little\r\nsalt, and mix well into the meal. Put in a shallow dish, and bake about a\r\nhalf hour in a quick oven.\r\n\r\n_Biscuits._--Biscuits should be thin, crisp, delicately browned and free\r\nfrom flour. The inside of a biscuit should be flaky and dry. Thick,\r\nsoggy, heavy biscuits impose a severe task upon digestion. Make the\r\nbiscuits about two inches in diameter, and three-quarters of an inch\r\nthick. Bake them brown on both the top and the bottom. It is much easier\r\nto make light, wholesome biscuits with baking-powder than with soda.\r\nButtermilk biscuits are very delicate and palatable, but not quite so\r\ncertain to turn out well. If soda is not properly used you will have a\r\nyellow, evil-smelling compound, or else there will not be enough soda to\r\nmake the biscuits rise, and they will be dangerously heavy. To make\r\nsoda-biscuits sift one level teaspoonful of soda, one half-teaspoonful\r\nsalt, and one quart of flour together three times so as to get the soda\r\nthoroughly well mixed in. Now rub two tablespoons of lard into the flour\r\nand add enough buttermilk to make a soft dough. Roll out into a sheet,\r\ncut into small thin biscuits and bake in a hot oven until well browned.\r\nBaking-powder biscuits are made in the same way, by using two\r\nteaspoonfuls of baking-powder in place of the soda, and sweet milk\r\ninstead of buttermilk.\r\n\r\n_Yeast._--Put three hops in a pot containing two quarts of cold water.\r\nPlace on the stove and see that it boils twenty minutes. Have a pint of\r\nflour in a large bowl and mix into it a tablespoonful of sugar, one of\r\nsalt and a teaspoonful of ginger. Strain the water from the hops into\r\nthis, stirring constantly. Allow it to cool. When lukewarm put in a cup\r\nof yeast or a yeast-cake.\r\n\r\n_Rolls._--At night take one half-cup of lukewarm water, one\r\nhalf-teaspoonful of salt, three-quarters of a cup of yeast, and enough\r\nflour to make a thin batter. In the morning add to this a pint of milk, a\r\nteaspoonful of sugar, a half-cup of butter and beat in flour until it is\r\nno longer sticky. Set it in a warm place to rise and when well up knock\r\nback. Repeat this process, and when it comes up the third time make it\r\ninto rolls. Let it rise once more and then bake it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS WITH CHICKEN.\r\n\r\nThe simplest and easiest way to cook chicken is to fry it. A poorly fed\r\nchicken is better stewed. For baking and broiling the chicken must be\r\nfat. In whatever way the chicken is cooked there is danger of its being\r\ntough, dry, stringy, and tasteless. Plain, artless, boiling results in\r\ninsipidity. Quick, superficial frying means tough stringy fibres; and a\r\nhot oven frequently dries the meat until it is not fit to eat.\r\n\r\n_Fried Chicken._--All housewives think they can fry chicken, but the\r\nresults are vastly different, according to the way it is done. You may\r\nhave a tender, rich, delicious morsel, or tough masses of meat, stringy,\r\ntasteless and almost impossible to chew. Of course the condition of the\r\nchicken has a great deal to do with the results. A tender, well-fed\r\nchicken will fry far better and much more quickly than a thin, scrawny\r\none. The thinner the chicken the greater the necessity for care in\r\ncooking it. It must be cooked slowly, over a moderate fire, in a tightly\r\ncovered pan, until it is perfectly tender. Melt a little fat in the\r\nfrying-pan; flour, salt, and pepper the pieces of chicken and fry them in\r\nthe fat until nicely browned on both sides. Now cover closely and place\r\non the back of the stove where the chicken will steam for half an hour.\r\nWhen tender take up on a hot platter and put in the warming oven. Make a\r\nrich, brown gravy and pour over it.\r\n\r\n_Boiled Chicken._--Chickens may be boiled whole or cut into pieces. To\r\nboil whole place a few pieces of unsmoked bacon in a stew-pan that is\r\ndeep enough to hold the chicken and can be tightly covered. Cook slowly\r\nfor an hour without adding water, turning it often until it is evenly\r\nbrowned. Now add a small onion, some raw peeled potatoes not larger than\r\nan egg, and a little boiling water. Cook over a brisk fire for\r\nthree-quarters of an hour. Salt and pepper the chicken and put it and the\r\npotatoes in a baking-dish in a hot oven while making the gravy. A couple\r\nof hard-boiled eggs chopped very fine, and a little chopped parsley,\r\nimprove the gravy.\r\n\r\n_Baked Chicken._--A properly baked chicken is tender, juicy, and has a\r\nrich flavor, while one improperly baked is tough, dry, stringy, and\r\ntasteless. To bake a chicken properly the oven must not be too hot; the\r\nchicken must be repeatedly basted, and cooked until it is tender, but not\r\nuntil all dried up. Stuffing the chicken improves the flavor. To make the\r\ndressing, melt enough of any kind of wholesome fat in a hot frying-pan to\r\nkeep the bread crumbs from sticking, and fry in it a large onion,\r\nchopped fine, until it is tender. Place the dry bread-crumbs into the\r\nfat, and cook for half an hour over a slow fire, stirring often to keep\r\nfrom sticking, until the crumbs are slightly browned and well dried.\r\nSeason with salt, pepper and a little celery-salt, and moisten with just\r\nenough milk to make it stick together. Always taste the dressing to see\r\nif it is properly seasoned. A well-fed chicken can be baked more rapidly\r\nthan a thin one. If the chicken is thin add plenty of fat to the water in\r\nthe baking-pan; cover closely and cook slowly and carefully until it is\r\ntender, turning very often; if it is fat and well-fed put plenty of\r\nwholesome grease in the baking-dish, and without covering it, cook in a\r\nhot oven, basting frequently. A young, fat chicken will bake in an hour.\r\nAn older fowl may require two or three hours. It is a good plan to allow\r\nthe chicken plenty of time and then, if done too soon, to cover it\r\nclosely and keep it warm on the back of the stove. Use just enough water\r\nwhile baking to keep the fat from sputtering. If the water is cooked out\r\ntowards the end, and the chicken is thoroughly basted, the skin will take\r\non a rich, thick glazing that is highly creditable to the skill of the\r\ncook. Delicious gravy can be made of the fat by adding milk and\r\nthickening with flour.\r\n\r\n_Smothered Chicken._--Use a frying-size chicken. Split it down the back\r\nand rub with a little salt. Put it in a pan with a slice of bacon and a\r\npint of water. Cover the pan closely and let it simmer on top of the\r\nstove from one to two hours, or until the chicken is thoroughly tender.\r\nWhen done sprinkle with flour and baste well. Add a small tablespoon of\r\nbutter, and put in the oven and cook until brown.\r\n\r\n_Broiled Chicken._--A young, tender, fat chicken is better broiled than\r\nany other way. It has a finer flavor; is tenderer, more juicy and more\r\neasily digested; in fact broiled chicken is one of the most delicious\r\ndishes that can be served. There is no earthly use, however, in trying to\r\nbroil a chicken that is not fat and nice. If the chicken is a little too\r\nold to broil whole the breast will still be tender. Flatten the chicken\r\nby pounding it. Have a bed of clear, bright coals and a hot gridiron well\r\ngreased to prevent sticking. Cover with a baking-dish and turn often,\r\nallowing the bony side to stay down longer than the other side. From\r\nfifteen to twenty minutes should be enough, but it is always best to test\r\nwith a fork by pulling the fibres apart to see that they are not raw. As\r\nsoon as the raw look has disappeared the chicken is done. The least\r\nover-cooking injures the flavor. Serve on a hot platter. Pour over a\r\nlittle melted butter, seasoned with lemon juice and chopped parsley.\r\n\r\nTo bake or boil a turkey proceed the same as for chicken, simply allowing\r\nmore time. An eight-pound turkey will require three hours to roast.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING GOOD SOUPS.\r\n\r\n_Vegetable Soups._--The simplest and most easily prepared soups are those\r\nmade from peas, beans, tomatoes, asparagus, celery, carrots, onions, and\r\npotatoes. They require neither meat nor any previous preparation, but can\r\nbe made and eaten at once. These soups are somewhat paradoxical because\r\nthey are both cheap and rich; deliciously simple and simply delicious.\r\nTake enough of any of these vegetables to furnish sufficient soup after\r\nthey have been rubbed through a strainer and thinned with milk or cream.\r\nCook the vegetables thoroughly until perfectly soft, so that they can be\r\neasily rubbed through a coarse strainer. Add enough milk to this purée to\r\nmake it about the thickness of cream. Season with salt, pepper, and a\r\nlittle celery-salt, and serve with bits of bread browned crisp in the\r\noven.\r\n\r\nWhen the vegetables can be got fresh from the garden nothing is more\r\ndelicious than these soups, and in winter, canned peas and dried beans\r\nmake excellent substitutes. In making potato purée two onions boiled with\r\nthe potatoes improve the flavor. Potato soup without onion is tasteless;\r\na little celery boiled in with the potatoes and onion, makes it still\r\nnicer. Tomato soup is also better slightly flavored with onion and a\r\nlittle carrot. A little cold boiled rice, simmered for a half-hour in the\r\nsoup after the milk has been added, is an excellent addition. These soups\r\nare also delicious when made rather thin with milk and then thickened by\r\nputting the well-beaten yolks of two eggs into the hot soup-tureen, and\r\nstirring vigorously while adding the soup; this last soup must be served\r\nat once, as it cannot stand after the eggs are added.\r\n\r\n_Meat Soups._--These soups should always be made the day before required\r\nin order to thoroughly remove the fat, which cannot be done until it\r\nhardens on the top of the soup. Nothing is more disgusting than greasy\r\nsoup. The foundation for an infinite variety of soups is made by boiling\r\nabout a pound of meat in three pints of water. After the meat is cooked\r\nto pieces strain it out and keep the well-skimmed liquor, or \"stock,\" as\r\nit is called, in a stone jar in a cool place. It should form a jelly, and\r\nin order to prepare a different soup for each day, it is only necessary\r\nto heat some of the jelly and flavor it differently. For instance: Chop\r\nfine one small onion to each person and fry it in butter, or in some of\r\nthe grease taken off the soup, until tender and slightly brown. Pour over\r\nenough stock and let stand for half an hour. Serve with a little grated\r\ncheese. Cabbage soup is made in the same way except that it takes longer\r\nto cook the cabbage. Instead of one vegetable several may be used.\r\nTurnips, cabbage, onions, and carrots in about the same proportion,\r\nchopped fine and fried tender, without any water, and added to the soup,\r\nmake what is known in France as Julienne soup.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGGS IN SEVERAL FORMS.\r\n\r\n_Coddled Eggs._--The most delicate way to cook an egg is to coddle it.\r\nPut six into a vessel that will hold two quarts. Fill with boiling water,\r\ncover closely, and let it stand in a warm place for ten minutes. If you\r\ndesire them better cooked let them stay in the water longer. If you want\r\nto do but one egg, put it in a quart of boiling water, cover and let\r\nstand five minutes.\r\n\r\n_Shirred Eggs._--To shirr an egg break it into a saucer or any small dish\r\nthat has been well greased. Put into a hot oven and leave until glazed.\r\nSeason and serve at once.\r\n\r\n_Scrambled Eggs._--Heat a teaspoonful of milk to each egg in a sauce-pan\r\nnot more than a quarter of an inch deep and about the right size to hold\r\nthe quantity of eggs desired. Add a little salt, pepper, and butter. When\r\nhot put in the eggs, and as they lie on the bottom of the pan, scrape off\r\nwith a spoon letting the raw part take the place of those portions\r\nalready cooked, and continue this until a creamy custard is formed. Be\r\ncareful not to cook the eggs so long that this custard is changed to a\r\nhard mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPER COOKING OF VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\nThe general tendency in cooking vegetables is to use altogether too much\r\nwater so that they become soaked and tasteless. The ideal way to cook\r\nmost vegetables is to use as little water as possible; just a little in\r\nthe bottom of the pot so that the vegetables will not stick and burn, but\r\nsteam through in their own juices until thoroughly tender and full of\r\ntheir own flavor. The fire should not be too hot; the pot should be\r\ntightly covered; a sufficient amount of butter must be added when the\r\nvegetable is about half done; and plenty of time given to allow it to\r\nsimmer and steam until thoroughly flavored. Onions, beans, carrots, and\r\ncabbage are most delicate when chopped fine, cooked until tender in a\r\nvery little water, seasoned with salt, pepper, and butter, covered with\r\nmilk, and allowed to stand on the back of the stove for twenty minutes\r\nuntil the flavor is thoroughly developed.\r\n\r\n_Boiled Potatoes._--Potatoes should not be peeled before boiling, but\r\nshould be thoroughly washed and rinsed. They should be put in an\r\nabundance of boiling water, well salted, and covered tightly. When tender\r\npour off all the water, cover the pot with a towel and let it stand on\r\nthe back of the stove for ten minutes.\r\n\r\n_Baked Potatoes._--If baked potatoes stand they lose their flavor. A\r\nbaked potato, eaten as soon as done, is sweet, dry and mealy. Allow them\r\nto stand even for ten minutes and the flavor is lost, and they become wet\r\nand tasteless. A pleasant change is to peel the potatoes before baking.\r\nThese must be eaten as soon as they come from the oven or they lose their\r\ncrispness.\r\n\r\n_Beans._--Nothing is more valuable for winter food than beans. They give\r\nas much strength as beefsteak and are far less expensive. Soak them in\r\nplenty of water over night; add a generous piece of unsmoked bacon; let\r\nsimmer on the back of the stove until they are tender and the water is\r\nwell cooked away; cover with milk, and either let them stand on the back\r\nof the stove until the milk is thickened, or put them into a shallow\r\nbaking-dish and bake until nearly dry. Serve either hot or cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME CAPITAL DESSERTS.\r\n\r\n_Apple Pudding._--Peel and slice enough apples to nearly fill your\r\npudding-dish, sugar to taste, and grate over them a little nutmeg. Also\r\nadd a little water. Now make a batter as follows: Three quarters of a cup\r\nof sugar; a piece of butter the size of a small egg, one half-cup of\r\nmilk, one egg, a pinch of salt, a teaspoonful of baking-powder, and one\r\nand one-eighth cups of flour. This is an extremely nice, wholesome\r\npudding, which can be served with either cream or hard sauce.\r\n\r\nTo make hard sauce take a half-cup of butter and cream it with a fork;\r\nadd a cupful of sugar and beat until nicely mixed and creamy. Flavor to\r\ntaste and sprinkle a little nutmeg over it.\r\n\r\n_Cottage Pudding._--One cupful of sugar, one tablespoonful of butter, one\r\nhalf-cupful of milk, two eggs, one and one-half cupfuls of flour, and one\r\nteaspoonful of baking-powder. For the sauce, take three and a half\r\ncupfuls of boiling water and stir in it a cupful of sugar, and a\r\ntablespoonful of either flour or corn-starch rubbed smooth with a little\r\ncold water. Cook well for two or three minutes; take the pan from the\r\nfire, add the butter and flavor as you prefer.\r\n\r\n_Batter Pudding Boiled or Baked._--One quart of milk, six eggs beaten\r\nseparately, six tablespoonfuls of flour worked gradually into the yolks\r\nof the eggs, and a pinch of salt. Bake or boil about three-quarters of an\r\nhour. Serve with sauce.\r\n\r\n_Cream of Corn-starch._--One quart of milk, four eggs, one half-cupful\r\nsugar, four tablespoonfuls of corn-starch dissolved in a little milk.\r\nInto a pint of the milk put the sugar, and place on the stove to heat.\r\nWhen very hot gradually stir in the corn-starch and beat well. Have ready\r\nthe whites of the eggs, and beat them into the milk; flavor as preferred.\r\nTake the other pint of milk, the four yolks and four light tablespoonfuls\r\nof sugar, and place them over the fire, stirring constantly. This makes a\r\nnice custard. Just before serving pour the custard over the pudding.\r\n\r\n_Caramel Custard._--One egg for each person; also one teaspoonful of milk\r\nfor each person. Put the yolks and milk together with a tablespoonful of\r\nsugar to each egg. Have ready some caramel, and stir in enough to give a\r\ndecided flavor. Put this into cups or baking-dishes, and set in a pan of\r\nhot water on top of the stove for twenty minutes; then in the oven until\r\nthe custard sets. Serve cold. For the caramel, take two cupfuls of sugar\r\n(preferably brown) and put it in a frying-pan with a teaspoonful of\r\nwater. Cook until well burned. Add a cup of water, and, when cold, put it\r\nin a bottle or fruit-jar. This quantity will last a long time.\r\n\r\n_Brown Betty Pudding._--Take a cupful of grated bread-crumbs, two cupfuls\r\nof finely chopped, tart apples, half a cupful of brown sugar, a\r\nteaspoonful of cinnamon, and one tablespoonful of butter. Butter a deep\r\npudding-dish, and put a layer of apples on the bottom; then sprinkle with\r\nsugar, cinnamon and bits of the butter. Put in another layer of apples,\r\nand proceed as before until all the ingredients have been used. Cover the\r\ndish and bake for three-quarters of an hour in a moderate oven; remove\r\nthe cover now and brown the pudding. Serve with sugar and cream.\r\n\r\n_Rice Pudding._--One cupful of boiled rice (better if still hot), three\r\ncupfuls of milk, three-quarters of a cup of sugar, a tablespoonful of\r\ncorn-starch, and two eggs; add flavoring. Dissolve the corn-starch with a\r\nlittle of the milk, and stir it into the rest of the milk; also add the\r\nyolks of the eggs and the sugar beaten together. Put this over the fire\r\nand when hot add the rice. Stir it carefully until it begins to thicken,\r\nthen take it off and add the flavoring. Put it into a pudding-dish and\r\nbake in the oven.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  Accidents, 223.\r\n\r\n  Acid, carbolic, for _Rhus_ poisoning, 260;\r\n    in
