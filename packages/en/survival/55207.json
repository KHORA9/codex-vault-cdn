W. WILLISTON.\r\n\r\nPART I, WITH PLATE I.\r\n\r\nThe first American species of the singular group of extinct Mesozoic\r\nreptiles variously know as Ornithosaurs, Pterosaurs or Pterodactyls was\r\ndescribed by Marsh from a fragmentary specimen obtained in 1870, by the\r\nYale College Expedition in Wallace County, Kansas. About a dozen other\r\nspecimens were obtained by a similar expedition the following year in\r\ncharge of Professor Marsh, or by Professor Cope, and were described by\r\nthese authors shortly afterward. By far the largest number of known\r\nspecimens, however, other than those in the Kansas University Museum,\r\nwere obtained during the years 1874, ’75, ’76 and ’77 by parties of\r\nwhich Professor Mudge, Dr. H. A. Brous, E. W. Guild, George Cooper and\r\nmyself were the members, and it was from these specimens that most\r\nof the published characters were derived. Many of these specimens\r\nare necessarily fragmentary ones, still the material now in the Yale\r\nCollege Museum is ample to elucidate everything of interest concerning\r\nthese animals.\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years, the Museum of Kansas University has been\r\nenriched by a series of excellent specimens of these animals, obtained\r\nfrom the same regions, specimens that permit the solution of most of\r\nthe doubtful characters and throw not a little light on the affinities\r\nof the Kansas forms.\r\n\r\nThe species hitherto named are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nPTERANODON.\r\n\r\n     _Pteranodon_ Marsh, Amer.

In the following year, a fuller\r\ndescription was given of additional remains referred to the same\r\nspecies and renamed _P. occidentalis_.\r\n\r\n=Pteranodon ingens.=\r\n\r\n     _Pterodactylus ingens_ Marsh, Amer.

Sci. xii, p. 480, Dec. 1876) says this name is a\r\nsynonym of _P. ingens_, published two days earlier. As this synonymy is\r\nnot certain, and as Cope’s species has been figured, I am not ready to\r\naccept his views.\r\n\r\n=Pteranodon velox.=\r\n\r\n     _Pterodactylus velox_ Marsh, Amer. Journ.

Sci. xxi, p. 343, April 1881: ibid.\r\nxxvii, p. 423, May 1884.\r\n\r\n[1] This preoccupation rests, so far as I am aware, upon Marsh’s\r\nstatement. I can find no evidence of the name having been previously\r\nused.\r\n\r\n=Nyctodactylus gracilis.=\r\n\r\n     _Pteranodon gracilis_ Marsh, Amer. Journ.

Sci. xxi,\r\n        p. 343, April 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nPTERANODON.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Skull.=\r\n\r\nFragmentary portions of the skull of Pteranodon are not at all rare\r\nin the Kansas chalk; but it is exceedingly seldom that a complete,\r\nor even approximately complete specimen is found. Their great length\r\nand slenderness, together with the extensive pneumaticity of the\r\nbones, render their preservation, as a whole, a thing of great rarity.\r\nProbably the most nearly perfect one yet known is now in the Museum\r\nof Kansas University. It was discovered the past summer by Mr. E. C.\r\nCase, a member of the University Geological Expedition. The specimen\r\nwas carefully cleaned on its upper surface, as it lay in the chalk, and\r\nthen imbedded in plaster before removal. The surface now exposed was\r\nthe under one, which surface is, almost invariably, better preserved\r\nand less distorted than the upper one in these animals. A figure of\r\nthis specimen is given in Plate I. The only portion restored is that\r\nindicated by the line in the lower jaw; it is possible that this part\r\nof the symphysis may not be exactly as it is drawn. Other, incomplete,\r\nspecimens in the Museum confirm the outlines, except in the occipital\r\ncrest, which is not present. As stated by me in the American Naturalist\r\n(_l. c._), the type specimen of _Pteranodon_, also collected by myself,\r\nwas incomplete, and the figures of it, as given by Marsh, are faulty.\r\n\r\nThe elements of the skull are all so firmly united that they can\r\nnot be distinguished. There are no indications whatever of a horny\r\nsheath enclosing the jaw, and it is improbable that the covering of\r\nthese parts was essentially different from that in the slender jawed\r\n_Pterodactylidae_. In texture, the maxillaries are fine-grained, and\r\nwholly without the vascular foramina found in the corresponding bones\r\nof birds. The bones are composed of two thin and firm plates, separated\r\nby cavities which are bounded by irregular walls of bony tissue. In the\r\ncompression from which all the Pterodactyl bones have suffered more or\r\nless, the greater resistance of these walls has caused irregularities\r\nupon both the outer and the inner surfaces. At the borders of the\r\nbones, where the thickness has been greater, the roughening is not\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nSeen from above, the skull is narrow, as stated by Marsh; but, contrary\r\nto his statement, there is not a sharp ridge extending along the\r\nupper border. This border is obtuse and rounded, and in the frontal\r\nregion, flattened. The sagittal crest is large, but not nearly so\r\nlarge as it is figured by Marsh, the restored outline of whose figure\r\nis undoubtedly wrong. The texture of the bone forming the crest is\r\nmaterially different from that of the remaining bones of the skull.\r\nThe bone is more roughened, and less firm. There is a well-developed\r\nring of sclerotic ossifications. In the specimen figured, the separate\r\nplates measure from six to eight millimeters in diameter. They were\r\nnot imbricated, as in the Pythonomorpha, but have a similar dense\r\ntexture. There is a superior temporal arch, bridging over a small\r\nopening leading downward to the inferior temporal fossa. The following\r\nmeasurements will give the principal dimensions of this specimen.\r\n\r\n  Length from tip of premaxillary to occipital condyle    680 millim.\r\n  Extreme length of skull                                 780\r\n  Extent of crest beyond orbit                            145\r\n  Greatest diameter of orbit                               65\r\n  Antero-posterior diameter of nasal opening              135\r\n  Length of quadrate                                      120\r\n  Width of lower jaw at articulation                       22\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pubis.=\r\n\r\nIn a previous paper on the anatomy of _Pteranodon_,[2] I stated that\r\nI had never seen the so-called “prepubic bones.” Since that time,\r\nhowever, an excellent specimen of them has been discovered among\r\nour material. The specimen of which they are a part consists of the\r\nlarger portion of the skeleton, and is perhaps conspecific with the\r\none to which the described pelvis belongs. The figure given herewith\r\nwill convey a good idea of their shape. The bones of the two sides\r\nare firmly co-ossified, and have been pressed nearly flat; the figure\r\nrepresents them as they are spread out in one plane. The bone is\r\nvery thin throughout, with a slight thickening at the ischial (_a_)\r\nattachment only. Lying contiguous with the anterior projection, is a\r\nslender ventral rib (_b_). It is possible that the curvature of this\r\nbone may be inward, rather than outward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n[2] Amer. Naturalist, Dec. 1891, p. 1124. In this article the\r\ndescription of the foot-phalanges should read: “All are slender, except\r\nthe second one in the third toe, and the second and third in the fourth\r\ntoe, where they are scarcely longer than wide.”\r\n\r\nThis peculiar structure of the pubis (I believe it represents the\r\npubis, and not the prepubis), seems to be quite similar to that\r\nwhich obtains in the genus _Rhamphorhynchus_, and, perhaps also, in\r\n_Pterodactylus suevicus_ (_Cycnorhamphus_ Seeley), and very different\r\nfrom that found in other species of _Pterodactylus_.\r\n\r\nThe principal measurements of the above described specimen are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Antero-posterior expansion                    40 millim.\r\n  Length of symphysis                           14\r\n  Expanse of the united bones, as flattened     90\r\n  Width of ischial process                      11\r\n\r\n\r\nNYCTODACTYLUS.\r\n\r\nThe type species of this genus was described as follows by its author\r\n(loc. cit. supra):\r\n\r\n     “One of the smallest American species yet found is\r\n     represented in the Yale Museum by several bones of the\r\n     wing, a number of vertebrae and the nearly complete\r\n     pelvis. The wing-bones preserved are elongated and very\r\n     slender. The pelvis is unusually small, and there are five\r\n     vertebrae in the sacrum. The last of the series indicates\r\n     that the tail was short. The following are the principal\r\n     measurements of this specimen:\r\n\r\n  Length of ulna                                             187 millim.\r\n  Length of metacarpal of wing-finger                        300\r\n  Antero-posterior diameter of outer condyle at distal end    15\r\n  Transverse diameter of shaft, above condyles                13\r\n  Length of first phalanx of wing-finger                     347\r\n  Extent of five vertebrae of sacrum                          57\r\n\r\nThis species, which may be called _Pteranodon gracilis_, was about\r\ntwo-thirds the size of _P. velox_ Marsh. It probably measured about ten\r\nfeet between the tips of the expanded wings.”\r\n\r\nIn the December number of the same volume of the American Journal of\r\nScience, he described the genus as follows:\r\n\r\n     “A second genus of American Pterodactyls is represented\r\n     in the Yale Museum by several well preserved specimens.\r\n     This genus is nearly related to _Pteranodon_, but may be\r\n     readily distinguished from it by the scapular arch, in\r\n     which the coracoid is not co-ossified with the scapula. The\r\n     latter bone, moreover, has no articulation at its distal\r\n     end, which is comparatively thin and expanded. The type of\r\n     this species is _Pteranodon gracilis_ Marsh, which may now\r\n     be called _Nyctosaurus gracilis_. It was a Pterodactyl of\r\n     medium size, measuring about eight to ten feet between the\r\n     tips of the expanded wings.”\r\n\r\nThe specific description of this species rests solely upon the\r\nmeasurements; the other characters given are not only vague, but are\r\nalso common to all the known species. The generic description, as it is\r\nseen, is based upon the structure of the coraco-scapula. It will also\r\nbe observed that the characters are not drawn from the type specimen,\r\nas that did not include this part of the skeleton, according to the\r\nauthor’s statement. Of these two characters, the non-ossification\r\nof the coracoid and scapula is a somewhat doubtful one, as the same\r\ncharacter may or may not occur in allied species, as, for example, in\r\nthe species of _Rhamphorhyncus_ (_R. Muensteri_ Goldf.) described by\r\nthe author himself. So incomplete and unsatisfactory are the characters\r\nthus given that Zittel, in his Handbuch, dismisses the genus with the\r\nbrief remark, “noch unbeschrieben.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, from the peculiar form of the scapula, and from my\r\nrecollection of the specimens upon which the genus was based, I\r\nbelieve I have determined with certainty an excellent specimen in the\r\nSnow Museum of Kansas University as a member of it, and here give a\r\nsufficiently complete description to place the genus on a more secure\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nThis specimen was collected by Professor E. E. Slosson, of Wyoming\r\nUniversity, while a member of my party in western Kansas the past\r\nseason. It was partly exposed upon a gently sloping surface of firm\r\nyellow chalk on the Smoky Hill river, in the vicinity of Monument\r\nRocks. Originally, the nearly complete skeleton must have been\r\npreserved, but a number of the bones had been either wholly or\r\npartially washed away, in some cases leaving their imprint in the\r\nchalk. The bones uncovered, and now lying upon the chalk slab nearly\r\nin their natural relations, are a humerus, both radii and ulnae, a\r\npteroid, the two carpals of one wrist, both wing metacarpals, a first\r\nand a last wing phalanx, both coraco-scapulae, the posterior part of\r\nthe lower jaws, ilium, femur, sternum, numerous ribs and vertebrae. The\r\ntwo coraco-scapulae lie with their scapular ends nearly touching, and\r\ntheir coracoid ends separated by a space equivalent to the width of the\r\nsternal articulation. The two elements appear to have been imperfectly\r\nunited and were probably not co-ossified. The inferior border of the\r\ncoracoid, near the humeral articulation, has a greater expansion than\r\nis found in _Pteranodon_; its shaft is more rounded and less rugose,\r\nlacking especially the strong muscular markings upon the external\r\nsurface. The articular surface does not appear to differ materially\r\nfrom that in _Pteranodon_. The scapula is of nearly the same length\r\nas the coracoid, but is much less stout. It is a thin, spatulate\r\nbone, slightly expanded at the distal extremity, where the margin is\r\nrounded, and without the characteristic oblique articular facet. It\r\nhas no supra-glenoid expansion or process on the posterior proximal\r\nborder, but has its margin nearly straight or gently concave from the\r\narticulation to its extremity. The space included between the bones\r\nof the two sides as they lie is a nearly regular, oval one, measuring\r\nninety-five millimeters in its greater, forty-five in its lesser\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nThe sternum lies at a little distance from the coraco-scapulae. It is\r\nan extremely thin bone, with a stout anterior, styliform projection,\r\nat the base of which, on either side, looking upward and outward,\r\nis the articular, trochlea-like surface for the sternal end of the\r\ncoracoid. The width between these articular surfaces measures fifteen\r\nmillimeters; the length of the process in front of the articulations\r\nis twenty-five millimeters. Immediately posterior to the articular\r\nsurfaces, the bone expands nearly at right angles to the longitudinal\r\naxis to a width of about sixty millimeters. The thin lateral margins\r\nare nearly parallel with the longitudinal axis, and show three shallow\r\nemarginations between the four costal articular projections. The\r\nhind angles are nearly rectangular. The bone, as preserved, is only\r\nshallowly concave, and shows no true keel, though a more pronounced\r\nmedian convexity towards the front doubtless subserved the function of\r\na carina in part.\r\n\r\nThe left humerus lies in position, and is especially characterized by\r\nits enormous deltoid crest (radial crest of Marsh), though otherwise\r\nslender. This crest is further removed from the head of the bone\r\nthan is the case in species of _Pteranodon_. It is directed somewhat\r\ndownward, and has its distal, gently convex, border about twenty-five\r\nmillimeters in extent, while the width of the process midway between\r\nthe extremity and the base measures but sixteen millimeters. The\r\nbicipital crest is also prominent. The bone is relatively shorter than\r\nin _Pteranodon_.\r\n\r\nThe humerus, as will be seen from the above description, and from\r\nthe measurements given below, is remarkably like the same bone in\r\n_Pteranodon nanus_, as described by Marsh (_l. c. supra_), and but\r\na little larger. In _P. nanus_, however, the coracoid and scapula\r\nare said to be firmly co-ossified, and the scapula has of course a\r\ndifferent structure.\r\n\r\nThe skull has been, unfortunately, almost wholly washed away, a\r\nfragment of the cranial wall and the posterior part of the lower jaws\r\nalone remaining. It is impossible, hence, to say much concerning this\r\npart of the anatomy. The lower jaws show a different structure from\r\nthat in _Pteranodon_. As they lie in their natural position, the width\r\nat the condyles is about twenty-four millimeters. The angular is less\r\nproduced posterior to the articulation than in _Pteranodon_, indicating\r\na less elongated and less powerful mandibular portion, an indication\r\nfurther borne out by the slenderness of the rami. The impression in\r\nthe chalk shows the symphysis to begin ninety millimeters from the\r\narticulation. The width at this place could not have exceeded sixteen\r\nmillimeters; and the entire length of the lower jaws could hardly\r\nhave been more than one hundred and twenty-five millimeters. In the\r\nparts preserved, measuring seventy-five millimeters, there are no\r\nindications of teeth; yet it is not impossible that there may have been\r\nteeth in the anterior portion of the dentary, as in some species of\r\n_Pterodactylus_. I hardly think it probable, however.\r\n\r\nThere are seven cervical vertebrae preserved, apparently the full\r\ncomplement, as in _Pteranodon_ and other members of the order. They\r\ndiffer in no especial respect from the corresponding vertebrae of\r\n_Pteranodon_, and, apparently, of _Pterodactylus_. The imperfectly\r\nanchylosed, possibly free, atlas shows three pieces, the odontoid\r\nprocess and the two slender lateral pieces. The lateral pieces are\r\nentirely free, with a thickened base and a slender, curved upper\r\nportion. The odontoid is gently concave in front, and seems to be\r\nimperfectly ossified with the axis; it occupies the lower part of the\r\narticulation, corresponding to the hypapophysis of the Pythonomorpha.\r\nThe axis is the shortest of the remaining vertebrae, and has a well\r\ndeveloped spine. The centrum is strongly convex behind, as are the\r\nremaining centra of the series. The following five vertebrae decrease\r\ngradually in length. The anterior ones have only a thin ridge or plate\r\nfor the neural spine; the seventh, however, has a neurapophysis of\r\nsome length. They are all, as is usually the case, somewhat distorted\r\nfrom pressure. The under side is flattened, apparently gently concave\r\nlongitudinally, and with a lateral ridge terminating in an obtuse\r\nhypapophysis at each inferior hind angle.\r\n\r\nIn his discussion of the Pterosauria, Zittel says concerning the\r\nvertebrae: “zwischen oberen Bogen und Centrum ist keine Sutur zu\r\nbemerken.” Handbuch, iii, p. 776. In this he is in error, so far as\r\nthe American forms are concerned. It is usually the case in the Kansas\r\nspecimens of both genera that the neural arch of the post-cervical\r\nvertebrae is wholly or in part detached from the centrum, showing a\r\nsutural, and not anchylosed union in life. The centra of twelve\r\nvertebrae are preserved, in the present specimen, from the region back\r\nof the neck; in only five of them are the neural arches in any way\r\nattached. Three of these are evidently anterior thoracic, judging from\r\ntheir structure and the position in which they lie. The shortest of\r\nthem, to which was attached a very large rib, and which was lying in\r\nfront of the scapulae, may represent the first thoracic vertebra (_a_).\r\nIts centrum is fully as wide as long, is flat on the under surface,\r\nand has a large, stout, horizontal parapophysis near the anterior end.\r\nJust above this process for the attachment of the head of the rib,\r\nand separated by a deep notch, is a much more elongated, horizontal\r\ndiapophysis for the tuberculum. The cup of the centrum is shallowly\r\nconcave; the transverse, shallowly U-shaped ball is only a little\r\nconvex.\r\n\r\nTwo other vertebrae (_b_), found close by the one just described, and\r\npossibly one or the other contiguous with it, differ remarkably in\r\nhaving no, or a rudimentary, parapophysial process, and in having the\r\ndiapophyses much shorter. It is not impossible that a slight expansion\r\nat the lateral margins of the ball may represent small parapophyses.\r\nIn _Pteranodon_ there are at least four vertebrae with dia- and\r\nparapophyses. In the other vertebrae from this region the diapophyses\r\nare yet shorter and the neural spine stouter and broader. The other\r\ncentra preserved are all shaped somewhat like the half of a cylinder,\r\nand are a little longer than broad. They have no distinct cup or ball.\r\nIn two of them there is a very long, recurved parapophysial process,\r\nas though formed by an anchylosed rib, on each side; they are probably\r\nlumbar vertebrae.\r\n\r\nMost of the ribs are very slender; a few are moderately thickened; one\r\nonly is very stout; its measurements are given below.\r\n\r\n  Length of lateral pieces of the atlas                       7  millim.\r\n  Diameter of lateral pieces at the base                      3½\r\n  Width of odontoid                                           4½\r\n  Height of odontoid                                          3\r\n  Length of axis                                              8\r\n  Height of axis                                              15\r\n  Length of third cervical vertebra                           21\r\n  Length of fourth cervical vertebra                          20\r\n  Length of fifth cervical vertebra                           19\r\n  Length of sixth cervical vertebra                           18\r\n  Length of seventh cervical vertebra                         17\r\n  Height of seventh cervical (about)                          15\r\n  Length of centrum, anterior thoracic vertebra (_a_)          6\r\n  Width of ball (_a_)                                          8\r\n  Expanse of parapophyses (_a_)                               14\r\n  Expanse of diapophyses (_a_)                                26\r\n  Width of neural canal (_a_)                                  3\r\n  Length of centrum, anterior thoracic vertebra (_b_)          8\r\n  Width of ball (_b_)                                         10\r\n  Expanse of diapophyses (_b_)                                17\r\n  Height of neural spine (_b_)                                20\r\n  Width of neural spine (_b_)                                  5\r\n  Length of rib (_c_)                                         45\r\n  Width of shaft (_c_)                                         5\r\n  Distance from center of capitulum to center\r\n       of tubercle (_c_)                                      10\r\n  Length of coracoid                                          50\r\n  Antero-posterior diameter, sternal extremity                 9\r\n  Length of scapula                                           45\r\n  Width of scapula at distal end                              15\r\n  Length of humerus                                           80\r\n  Width through deltoid crest                                 24\r\n  Least diameter of shaft of humerus                          13\r\n  Length of ulna                                             133\r\n  Width of ulna at distal extremity                           22\r\n  Length of radius                                           130\r\n  Width of radius distally                                    15\r\n  Length of wing-finger metacarpal                           220\r\n  Width of same metacarpal at proximal end                    20\r\n  Diameter through condyles                                   15\r\n  Transverse diameter of shaft above condyles                 10\r\n  Length of first phalanx, wing-finger                       263\r\n  Width of same phalanx at proximal end                       24\r\n  Width of same phalanx at distal end                         15\r\n  Width of sternum                                            67\r\n  Length of rib borders                                       25\r\n  Length of femur                                             75\r\n  Diameter of head of femur                                    5\r\n  Diameter of femur through condyles                          12\r\n  Length of pteroid bone                                      88\r\n\r\nThe principal dimensions of this species can be got at with\r\nconsiderable certainty. Although two of the wing-phalanges and the\r\nbones of the foot are wanting, yet the relative proportions of those\r\npresent agree so closely with those of the corresponding bones in\r\n_Pteranodon_, that there can be but little possibility of error in\r\nassuming the same proportions for the missing ones. The position of the\r\nilium and femur, as also the ribs, show that they hold their natural\r\nrelations to the pectoral arch. The tail, alone, can not be got at.\r\n\r\n  Extreme expanse of wing-bones              2400 mm.   7 ft. 10 in.\r\n  Expanse of wings in life, approximated     2000       6      6\r\n  Length of head, estimated                   150              6\r\n  Length of neck                              128              5½\r\n  Length of trunk                             165              6½\r\n  Length of leg and foot, outstretched        275             11\r\n\r\nBut one species has been described from the American Cretaceous smaller\r\nthan the present one, _Pteranodon nanus_ Marsh, in which the expanse of\r\nwings is given as not more than three or four feet. In this estimate\r\nthe author is certainly in error. The size of the humerus, as given,\r\nis rather more than three-fourths that of the present species, and the\r\nexpanse, hence, must be nearly five feet in life, or six feet as the\r\nbones lie outstretched.\r\n\r\nAs regards the specific determination of the present specimen, there\r\nmust necessarily be some doubt until the species already named have\r\nbeen recognizably described. But three of the existing species can be\r\ntaken into account, _N. gracilis_, _P. comptus_ and _P. nanus_. That it\r\ncan not be the last, has already been shown. In size, it agrees well\r\nwith _P. comptus_, but the other characters throw no light upon the\r\nidentity.\r\n\r\nThe measurements given of the type specimen of _N. gracilis_ show the\r\nsize to be materially greater,—a character, however, of subordinate\r\nvalue—greater slenderness, and a relatively shorter first wing-phalanx.\r\n\r\nThe relative lengths of wing-metacarpals, wing-phalanx and ulna in _N.\r\ngracilis_ and the present specimen may be expressed as follows:\r\n\r\n  Length of wing-metacarpal          100      100\r\n  Length of first wing-phalanx       115.6    119.5\r\n  Length of ulna                      62.3    60.4\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that not a single character has yet been given to\r\ndistinguish the genus from _Pterodactylus_, and it is not at all\r\nimpossible that it may prove to be the same; its location among the\r\n_Pteranodontidae_ rests solely on the assumed absence of teeth, and\r\nthat is a character yet wholly unknown.\r\n\r\nThe material now in the museum permits a fuller discussion of the\r\nrelations and characters of this group of reptiles than has been\r\nhitherto attempted. Originally, they were described as constituting a\r\nnew order, a view still held by its author and no one else. Lydekker,\r\nin his Paleontology and Catalogue gives them a subordinal value; Zittel\r\nonly a family value, though expressing doubt as to their subordinal\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nIt seems very probable that the genus _Nyctodactylus_ has no teeth\r\nin the jaws; it agrees in _every other respect_ with the genus\r\n_Pterodactylus_, so far as known. If the genus has teeth it must be\r\nunited with _Pterodactylus_. Now, in not a few species of this genus,\r\nthe teeth are confined to the anterior end of the jaws, and their\r\nentire absence, unaccompanied by other structural differences, will\r\nhardly constitute an order, or even family.\r\n\r\nBut, leaving aside _Nyctodactylus_, it is very much of a question\r\nwhether the differences between _Pterodactylus_ and _Pteranodon_ are\r\nsufficient to locate them in different families, let alone different\r\nsuborders.\r\n\r\nThe two genera have the following in common: Tail short. Skull with\r\nmore or less elongated, pointed jaws, and very small upper and lower\r\ntemporal fossae. Narial opening large, confluent with the pre-orbital\r\nforamen. Cervical vertebrae elongated, with rudimentary spinous\r\nprocesses. Fore and hind extremities, quite alike.\r\n\r\n_Pteranodon_ differs from _Pterodactylus_, so far as that genus is\r\nknown, in the united coracoscapulae and pubes, both of which characters\r\nare found in _Rhamphorhynchus_.\r\n\r\nThe sole family characters remaining then, for _Pteranodon_, are,\r\nabsence of teeth, a supra-occipital crest, and the articulation of\r\nthe upper end of the scapula. Now it seems evident that to place\r\nthe pteranodonts in a group equivalent to all the other pterosaurs\r\nis unwarranted, and any classification that will not show the more\r\npronounced relationships with _Pterodactylus_ is faulty. I would,\r\ntherefore, propose the following:\r\n\r\nOrder Pterosauria.\r\n\r\n     Family Pterodactylidae, subfamilies Pteranodontinae,\r\n        Pterodactylinae.\r\n     Family Rhamphorhynchidae.\r\n     Family Ornithocheiridae.\r\n\r\nAs regards the geographical distribution of the Pteranodonts, they\r\nhave hitherto been recognized only from Kansas, but I am firmly of the\r\nopinion that they occur in Europe, and, if so, it is very probable that\r\nthe name _Pteranodon_ must be eventually given up. In fact, a toothless\r\nform of Pterodactyl was described by Seeley as long ago as 1871,\r\nunder the name of _Ornithostoma_. I cannot refer to his description\r\nat present, and can, therefore, give no opinion as to their identity.\r\nIt seems certain that the peculiar form of the scapulae and their\r\nvertebral articulation[3] occur among some of the European forms, which\r\nwould strengthen the belief that _Pteranodon_ is also an European genus.\r\n\r\n[3] The specimens in which I have seen the vertebral articulation show\r\nno co-ossification of the vertebrae: the facet for articulation being\r\nplaced above the spines, and apparently formed by ossified ligaments.\r\n\r\nIn view of the above, the practice of the American text-books in\r\nGeology in introducing generic names of characteristic fossils as names\r\nof the geological horizons whence they come, is very reprehensible, in\r\nmy opinion. Even the late edition of Leconte’s Elements contains a long\r\nlist of such names, the greater portion of which have been relegated to\r\nthe limbo of synonymy by paleontologists. It is greatly to be desired\r\nthat the name “Pteranodon Beds” shall not become established, so long\r\nas there is the least doubt of the validity of the name itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANSAS MOSASAURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY S. W. WILLISTON AND E. C. CASE.\r\n\r\nPART I, CLIDASTES, WITH PLATES II-VI.\r\n\r\nThe group of extinct Cretaceous reptiles known as the Mosasaurs or\r\nPythonomorpha was defined by Cope, “to whom Science is so largely\r\nindebted for its present knowledge of this interesting order of\r\nreptiles” (Marsh), in 1869.[4] Although some of the characters assigned\r\nby him to the order have since been shown to be inapplicable, and\r\nthe group to have less value, yet his name, Pythonomorpha, has been\r\ngenerally retained. Lydekker and Zittel have assigned to the group a\r\nsubordinal value, as has also Marsh, though under a different name.\r\nOwen rejected it entirely, and Baur, more recently,[5] has united it\r\nwith the Varanidae to form a super-family, as follows:\r\n\r\n  Suborder Platynota.\r\n    Super-family Varanoidea.\r\n      Families Mosasauridae, Varanidae.\r\n    Super-family Helodermatoidea.\r\n      Family Helodermatidae.\r\n\r\nThe group, whatever may be its rank or position, includes, so far, the\r\nfollowing genera: _Mosasaurus_ Conyb., _Liodon_ Owen, _Platecarpus_\r\nCope, _Clidastes_ Cope, _Baptosaurus_ Marsh, _Sironectes_ Cope,\r\n_Plioplatecarpus_ Dollo and _Hainosaurus_ Dollo. _Pterycollasaurus_\r\nDollo, founded upon _Mosasaurus maximilianus_ Goldf., is omitted\r\nas doubtful. All of these genera, save _Plioplatecarpus_ and\r\n_Hainosaurus_, have been recorded from North America, _Clidastes_,\r\n_Baptosaurus_ and _Sironectes_ being peculiar to this country. Of these\r\nlatter three genera, however, _Clidastes_ alone is well known; but this\r\ngenus is suspected by Lydekker of being the same as the imperfectly\r\nknown European _Geosaurus_ Cuvier. Thus it seems that the genera, or\r\nat least the most of them, have a wide distribution; _Platecarpus_, in\r\nfact, is said to occur in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n[4] Proc. Bost. Soc. Nat. Hist., p. 253.\r\n\r\n[5] Science, xvi, p. 262, Nov. 7, 1890.\r\n\r\nIn America, members of the group have been discovered in the Cretaceous\r\ndeposits of New Jersey, Alabama, North Carolina, the upper Missouri\r\nregion, Nebraska, Kansas and New Mexico. Probably nineteen-twentieths\r\nof all the known specimens, however, have been obtained in western\r\nKansas. The material now in the University Museum, all from Kansas,\r\ncomprises several hundred specimens of these animals, including,\r\nprobably, the best ones known. It is upon this material that the\r\nfollowing preliminary studies are chiefly based.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Clidastes_, as first described by Cope, was based upon\r\ntwo dorsal vertebrae of _C. iguanavus_, the type species, from New\r\nJersey. Shortly afterward, however, he gave a full and careful generic\r\ndescription, as derived from an unusually good specimen of an allied\r\nspecies, _C. propython_, from Alabama. Only a little later, Marsh\r\ndescribed a genus, which he called _Edestosaurus_, from Kansas, but\r\nwithout giving any real, distinctive differences from _Clidastes_,\r\nfollowing the very reprehensible practice of naming supposed new forms\r\nin the hopes that future distinctive characters might be found. The\r\ngenus _Edestosaurus_ has been rejected by nearly all save the authors\r\nof the American text-books in Geology. It seems hardly necessary to\r\npoint out the identity. The only distinctive character the author\r\ngave for his genus was the insertion of the pterygoid teeth, and even\r\nthis character he modified later—“Palatine (sic) teeth more or less\r\npleurodont.”[6]\r\n\r\n[6] Amer. Journ. Sci. iii, June 1872.\r\n\r\nThis character, even were it real, is of very slight value; indeed it\r\ncannot be used to distinguish the species even.\r\n\r\n_Clidastes_ is, without doubt, one of the most highly specialized\r\ngenera in the group, and, what is very interesting, is one of the\r\nlatest. It occurs in Kansas in the uppermost part of the Niobrara beds,\r\nin the horizon so markedly characterized by the toothed birds. Both\r\n_Platecarpus_ and _Liodon_ occur, though in diminished numbers, almost\r\nto the very lowest portion, but _Clidastes_ has never been found except\r\ntowards the top. From measurements made the past season, the thickness\r\nof the beds in which these saurians occur cannot be less than six\r\nhundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe following species have been found in Kansas: none of them are known\r\nto occur elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSASAURIDAE.\r\n\r\n     _Mosasauridae_ Conybeare, in Cuvier, Ossem.

A brief preliminary description of the\r\nspecimen was given by the senior author in Science, December 8, 1891.\r\nA more complete description is here given, which, it is believed, will\r\nbe of service. The specimen is an unusually perfect one, being very\r\nnearly complete, and, as now mounted, shows the bones nearly all in the\r\nposition in which they were found. The vertebral column is continuous,\r\nexcept in one place, where the tail had been bent up over the back; and\r\ncomplete, save at the very tip of the tail. The skull is complete, or\r\nvery nearly complete, and has been restored nearly to the condition in\r\nlife. Figures have been made of this portion of the skeleton, and will\r\nbe given in a future communication. At present, it may be mentioned\r\nthat the lacrymals are small, roughly irregular bones, and pointed at\r\neither extremity. There are no indications of transverse bones, as\r\nthere are none in any other skull in the collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nCervical vertebrae.\r\n\r\nATLAS. The intercentrum is a small bone with three sides of\r\nnearly equal extent. The two upper, articular surfaces are gently\r\nconcave, and meet in a rounded margin; the inferior surface is convex,\r\nboth antero-posteriorly and transversely, with a roughened prominence\r\nin the middle. The lateral pieces have indistinctly separated facets\r\nfor articulation with the odontoid, the intercentrum and the occipital\r\ncondyle. The rather short, flattened lamina extends upward, backward\r\nand inward, approaching, but not reaching its fellow of the opposite\r\nside; it is somewhat dilated distally. Directed outwards and forwards,\r\nthere is a stout styliform process.\r\n\r\nAXIS. The neural spine of the axis is elongated\r\nantero-posteriorly. It is thin on the anterior portion, but stouter\r\nand longer at the posterior part. The large, stout odontoid process is\r\nunited suturally, as is also the well-developed atlantar hypapophysis,\r\nwhich forms the anterior, inferior portion of the bone. The diapophyses\r\nare the smallest of the costiferous series, with only a small articular\r\nfacet for the rib. The ball is strongly and evenly convex, with its\r\ngreater diameter transversely. The hypapophysis is the largest of the\r\nseries; it is suturally united with the stout, exogenous process of the\r\ncentrum, and projects downward and backward; its distal extremity is\r\nroughened for ligamentous attachments.\r\n\r\nThe third cervical vertebra shows a well-developed zygosphenal\r\narticulation, and stout articular processes. The transverse process is\r\nsmall, only a little larger than that of the axis, though, unlike that,\r\nit is strengthened by a ridge continued from the anterior zygapophyses.\r\nThe hypapophysis is smaller than that of the axis, but, like that,\r\nis directed downward and backward. The spine may be distinguished\r\nfrom that of any other vertebra by its stout, trihedral shape; it is\r\ndirected rather more obliquely backward than in the following vertebrae.\r\n\r\nThe fourth cervical vertebra differs from the third in having stouter\r\ntransverse processes; in the hypapophysis being directed more nearly\r\ndownward, and in its smaller size; and in the spine being flattened\r\nantero-posteriorly toward the base.\r\n\r\nThe fifth cervical vertebra differs from the fourth in the broader\r\nspine, in the stouter transverse processes, and the smaller\r\nhypapophysis.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth cervical vertebra, the hypapophysis is reduced to a small\r\nossification, scarcely longer than broad, directed downward. The spine\r\nhas reached nearly the full width of those of the following vertebrae,\r\nthough somewhat stouter above. The transverse processes are yet stouter.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh, or last, cervical vertebra the hypapophysis is\r\nwanting, or very rudimentary. The under part of the centrum shows a\r\nrounded ridge or carina, with a slight projection corresponding to the\r\nhypapophysis.\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENTS OF THE CERVICAL VERTEBRAE.\r\n\r\n  1.

Neither can it be said with certainty from this\r\nspecimen which is the first thoracic vertebra, as the cervical ribs\r\nhad, unfortunately, been displaced in the collection and preparation\r\nof the specimen. In another specimen, referred to _C. pumilus_, and\r\nwhich, as will be seen later, cannot be specifically distinguished\r\nfrom the present species, short cervical ribs were found attached to\r\nsix vertebrae posterior to the atlas. That the eighth vertebra is a\r\nthoracic one is shown by the relation of the ribs in this specimen.\r\nPosteriorly there is no distinction, also, between the true thoracic\r\nvertebrae and those of the lumbar region. All the vertebrae anterior to\r\nthe pelvis bear ribs, and will all be considered as dorsal vertebrae,\r\nthe true thoracic vertebrae being restricted to those of which the ribs\r\nare elongated, and, probably, connected with the sternum.\r\n\r\nIn the anterior vertebrae of the series, the centra are subcarinate\r\nbelow, the obtuse, rounded ridge becoming less and less apparent\r\nuntil no indications of the keel can be seen, before the middle\r\nof the series. The transverse processes are stoutest, with a more\r\nelongated, sigmoid articular surface, with little or no constriction,\r\nand projecting only slightly beyond the stout articulating processes,\r\nin the anterior vertebrae. In the tenth or eleventh, the articular\r\nsurface has become markedly smaller, more vertical, and less sigmoid in\r\noutline. Thence to the last, the articular surface for the ribs remains\r\nnearly the same. The process itself, however, becomes gradually more\r\nprominent and constricted, as the zygapophyses becomes smaller. The\r\nspinous processes increase slightly in length and breadth, and are only\r\nslightly oblique throughout. In length, the centra increase gradually.\r\nThe vertical diameter of the ball increases gradually, while the\r\ntransverse diameter remains more nearly the same.\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENTS OF THE DORSAL VERTEBRAE.\r\n\r\n   1.

From the position of the pelvis, it\r\nis evident that the ilia were attached to the first pair of these.\r\nPrecisely this relation of pelvis to the vertebrae is found in such\r\nlizards as the Monitor and Iguana, and it is probable that such is the\r\nrelation in all the Pythonomorpha. It will thus be seen that there\r\nare no distinctively lumbar vertebrae, if by such are meant free,\r\nnon-costiferous, pre-sacral vertebrae. The vertebrae of these animals\r\nthat have been so designated by writers are in reality basal caudal.\r\nA distinctive term for them—those with transverse, non-costiferous\r\nprocesses and without chevrons—is needed, and we propose,\r\nprovisionally, the term _pygial_. There are seven in the present\r\nseries, all characterized by elongated transverse processes, and not\r\ndiffering much from each other. The vertebrae lie in the matrix with\r\nthe ventral aspect uppermost, concealing the spine and upper parts.\r\nThe under surface is somewhat flattened, and, as in the preceding\r\nvertebrae, is gently concave antero-posteriorly. The transverse\r\nprocesses are elongate, stout towards the base, apparently all of\r\nnearly equal length, and directed gently backwards and downwards. In\r\nthe anterior vertebrae the processes spring from near the front part:\r\nas the centra become shorter they arise from near the middle. In the\r\nlast one of the series there are minute indications of chevrons.\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENTS OF THE PYGIAL CAUDAL VERTEBRAE.\r\n\r\n  1.

They become less constricted, and, back of the middle of\r\nthe series, are smoothly cylindrical in shape. The transverse processes\r\ndecrease gradually in length, disappearing entirely in the twenty-fifth\r\nor twenty-sixth. The spinous processes are more or less incompletely\r\npreserved in the anterior vertebrae. They increase only gradually in\r\nlength for the first twenty of the series, and are markedly oblique,\r\nwith the posterior border stout, and the anterior border alate. With\r\nthe twenty-sixth they begin to increase more rapidly in length, and\r\nhave become more nearly vertical in position, and are thinner at each\r\nmargin. In the thirty-fifth or thirty-sixth they attain their greatest\r\nlength, and are here directed slightly forwards. Thence to the end of\r\nthe tail, the length decreases gradually, and, in position, they are\r\ndirected more and more obliquely backward. The chevrons are strongly\r\noblique throughout the series and are firmly co-ossified with the\r\ncentrum.\r\n\r\nThe tail, it is thus seen, has a broad, vertical, fin-like extremity,\r\nwhich, doubtless, aided much in the propulsion of the animal through\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nThere are sixty-seven vertebrae with chevrons present in the specimen,\r\nall continuous, except in one place. The last one is less than\r\none-fourth of an inch in diameter, and shows that there had been yet\r\nanother, possibly several more. Toward the base of the series the tail\r\nhas been bent forwards over the back, and it is possible that, where\r\nthe break occurs, there has been a vertebra lost. The measurements,\r\nhowever, do not seem to indicate any loss. The entire series of\r\nvertebrae was not less than sixty-eight, and probably not more than\r\nseventy, making for the entire vertebral series one hundred and\r\nseventeen to twenty.\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENTS OF THE CHEVRON-BEARING CAUDAL VERTEBRAE.\r\n\r\n   1.

In a\r\nsmaller specimen, specifically indistinguishable from the present one,\r\nthe entire cervical series is preserved with the ribs attached. The\r\nfirst, that articulating with the axis, is very short. The following\r\nones are stouter, but increase only moderately in length, that of the\r\nsixth measuring only thirty-five millimeters, while that of the seventh\r\nis but a little longer. In the specimen of _C. velox_ described,\r\nthere is a detached cervical rib sixty-five millimeters in length; it\r\nprobably belongs with the seventh.\r\n\r\nThe thoracic ribs are simple, somewhat flattened rods, moderately\r\nexpanded at the proximal end. The greatest convexity is shown about the\r\nmiddle of the series, where the versedsine of the curvature is forty\r\nmillimeters, the chord being one hundred and sixty. Posteriorly, the\r\nshort ribs are only gently curved.\r\n\r\nLying by the side of the vertebral column, and between the ribs,\r\nas they have been pressed down, are a number of flattened, soft,\r\npunctulate bones, which are evidently the costal cartilages.\r\nPosteriorly four rows of them are seen, lying closely side by side,\r\nsome of them eight or ten inches in length. The sternum, composed\r\nof the same material, has been so crushed and crumpled that its\r\nshape cannot be made out. The whole structure here, whether of ribs,\r\ncartilages or sternum, reminds one very strongly of such lizards as the\r\nIguana or Monitor.

The first column is for _Clidastes_.\r\n\r\n  Skull          12.1        11.1\r\n  Neck            6.5         6.8\r\n  Trunk          39.2        28.0\r\n  Tail           42.3        54.1\r\n\r\n\r\nLimbs.\r\n\r\nThe figures in plates II and III will give a sufficiently good idea\r\nof the limbs in this specimen. They are figured as they were lying,\r\nshowing the outer sides of the coracoid, scapula and pelvic bones, and\r\nthe palmar or plantar surface of the remaining bones.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoracoid.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed in plates II and IV that there are two very\r\ndifferent types of coracoid, one with a deep emargination, the other\r\nwithout the slightest indication of such. The same non-emarginate\r\nform occurs in _C. tortor_, as specimens in our Museum show, in _C.\r\npropython_ Cope (Ext. Batr. etc. pl. xii, f. 16,) and in _C. dispar_,\r\nas figured by Marsh[7], and as stated by him in the same paper\r\n(“There is certainly no emargination in the coracoid of _Clidastes_,\r\n_Edestosaurus_ and _Baptosaurus_, as specimens in the Yale Museum\r\nconclusively prove.”) It is true that Marsh in a later paper[8] figured\r\na specimen with emarginate coracoid under the name of _Edestosaurus\r\ndispar_, but it is certain that his identification of his own species\r\nwas wrong, as will be seen by comparing his figures. From the senior\r\nauthor’s memory of the specimen with the emarginate coracoid figured,\r\nand from the figure itself he feels confident that the second specimen\r\nis _C. velox_.\r\n\r\n[7] Amer. Journ. Sci. iii, pl. xi, f. 1, June, 1872.\r\n\r\n[8] Amer. Journ. Sci. xix, pl. i, fig. 1, Jan., 1880.\r\n\r\nThat the emargination was overlooked by the author seems strange, as\r\nin the same paper in which this figure is given occurs the description\r\nof _Holosaurus, founded upon that very character_. If the emargination\r\nis sufficiently important to base a genus in the one case, then it\r\nshould be in the other, and the character could not be applied to\r\n_Edestosaurus_, based upon characters which it hardly seems possible\r\nthat the author himself could seriously consider, for _E. dispar_ was\r\nthe type of _Edestosaurus_.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, further, that the figured coracoids differ very\r\nmaterially in size, those with the emargination pertaining to a small\r\nspecies, while _C. dispar_ is one of the largest. In our Museum there\r\nare three specimens with the emarginate coracoid, all of them small or\r\nvery small, the described specimen of _C. velox_ being the largest.\r\n\r\nThe point of chief interest in this relation is the value that can be\r\ngiven to this character. Is it individual, specific or generic? Marsh\r\nhas called it generic, but we think an examination of the two very\r\ncomplete specimens of _C. tortor_ and _C. velox_ in our Museum will\r\nconvince any unprejudiced student that he is in error.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the figures herewith given of the paddles will show\r\ntheir great resemblance, and these two forms of paddles have been\r\nfigured because the species are the most unlike of any that we know in\r\nthe genus. As all the small specimens seem to possess this character,\r\nand as they cannot be called immature specimens, we believe the\r\ncharacter is a specific one. As Marsh says, typically both _Clidastes_\r\nand _Edestosaurus_ have a non-emarginate coracoid, so that neither name\r\ncould apply to the emarginate form, were it generically distinct.\r\n\r\nOur Museum also contains both forms of the coracoid pertaining to the\r\ngenus _Platecarpus_, of which _Holosaurus_ is a synonym.\r\n\r\nWhile studying the specimen above described, a striking similarity was\r\nobserved to several other specimens already determined with confidence\r\nas _C. pumilus_ Marsh. A more careful comparison failed to bring out\r\nany real differences beyond size, and even this was shown to be very\r\ninconstant.\r\n\r\nThe following comparison of the descriptions given by Marsh will be of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n _C. pumilus._\r\n\r\n     TEETH. Nearly round at base somewhat curved\r\n     and with smooth enamel.\r\n\r\n     QUADRATE. The rugose knob near the distal\r\n     end of the quadrate is similar to that in _C.\r\n     Wymani_ (just below the posterior superior process\r\n     is a prominent rugose knob with a deep pit under\r\n     it), but has no articular pit under it. The hook\r\n     is comparatively short and has a free compressed\r\n     extremity. The articular margin is not deflected\r\n     toward the meatus.\r\n\r\n     CERVICAL VERTEBRAE. Articular face nearly\r\n     vertical, and having a broad transverse outline with\r\n     faint superior emargination. The hypapophysis stout\r\n     and transversely triangular.\r\n\r\n _C. velox._\r\n\r\n     Premaxillary and maxillary teeth smooth and\r\n     subcompressed.\r\n\r\n     The great ala less curved than in _E. dispar_, concave\r\n     transversely on both surfaces. The alar process has\r\n     its articular process very narrow in its extension\r\n     over the great ala. No notch in posterior margin of\r\n     external angle. On the ridge below the angle and\r\n     nearly opposite the meatal pit is a strong rugosity\r\n     which is rudimentary or wanting in _C. dispar_. The\r\n     posterior margin of the hook is only a narrow tongue\r\n     projecting towards the meatal pit, instead of a broad\r\n     articular surface.\r\n\r\n     Articular face transverse.\r\n\r\nThe description, otherwise, shows no discrepancies of importance. The\r\nchief difference given by the author is the size, and this character\r\nwe think our specimens show to be of little specific value. “It\r\nis a question of some importance how far difference in size among\r\nthe Mosasauroids may be a test of difference in species. Among the\r\nnumerous remains of these animals which have been discovered I have\r\nnever yet observed any which presented any evidence relative to age.\r\n* * * In this view of the case, some of the many described species of\r\nMosasauroids may have been founded on different sizes of the same.”[9]\r\n\r\n[9] Leidy, Rep. U. S. Geol. Surv. Hayden, vol. i, p. 284.\r\n\r\nThe length of the cervical vertebrae in the specimen above described\r\nis thirty-seven or thirty-eight millimeters. The cervical vertebrae in\r\ntwo specimens referred to _C. pumilus_ have lengths respectively of\r\ntwenty-two and thirty millimeters. In the type specimen of _C. velox_\r\nthey must have had a length of at least forty-two millimeters.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that, between the smallest specimen, which, in life,\r\ncould have hardly exceeded eight feet in length, our specimens,\r\nindistinguishable anatomically, represent forms of ten and twelve feet,\r\nwhile the type itself was about fifteen feet in length.\r\n\r\nOf the material originally referred to _C. pumilus_, there are in the\r\ncollection five or more specimens, which, altogether, furnish nearly\r\nevery part of the skeleton. They present no tangible differences from\r\nthe skeleton of _C. velox_ described above. There can be, hence, little\r\nor no doubt but that the name _C. pumilus_ is a synonym.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible to say with certainty that _C. affinis_ Leidy\r\nis or is not the same as _C. velox_, but, so far as the description\r\ngoes, we can find few differences. The type is of about the same size\r\nas the type of _C. velox_, and the figures agree well with the bones\r\nof the skeleton described. Although the description was not published\r\ntill 1873, the author makes no mention of the species of Marsh’s. Leidy\r\ndescribes the back teeth as having the enamel strongly striated, with\r\nthe surface presenting evidences of subdivision into narrow planes. In\r\nthis respect, only, it disagrees with the specimen.\r\n\r\n_Plioplatecarpus_ Dollo is described by its author as having a sacrum\r\nof two conjoined vertebrae,[10] by reason of which it is placed in\r\na separate family from the rest of the _Pythonomorpha_. It may be\r\npresumptuous to express a doubt of the genuineness of the sacrum, and\r\nyet, save from the fact that the author found two specimens quite\r\nalike, one might doubt it strongly. It is not very rare that two, or\r\neven three vertebrae are found united from injury in these animals,\r\nand such would readily account for the consolidation as figured and\r\ndescribed by Dollo, except for the coincidence of the second specimen.\r\nA stronger reason for doubt is the statement that the consolidated\r\nvertebrae belong to the posterior “lumbar” region, and that the last\r\nvertebrae had small tubercles indicative of chevrons. In the reptiles\r\nwhich we have examined, the chevrons do not begin immediately behind\r\nthe pelvis, but are separated by a longer or shorter region in which\r\nthe vertebrae bear elongated diapophyses alone. If the conjoined\r\nvertebrae figured by Dollo are in reality sacral, it would appear\r\nthat the animal is an exception to _Clidastes_ and such lizards as we\r\nhave examined. Furthermore, the pelvis must have been of a different\r\nstructure from that in the Kansas genera of the Pythonomorpha, for, in\r\nthese, it is evident that the ilium had an oblique position, and could\r\nhave been attached to but a single diapophysis.\r\n\r\n[10] Bull.

SP.\r\n\r\nA specimen of much interest in the University collection differs so\r\nmarkedly from the other forms represented by specimens, as also from\r\nthe descriptions of the known species, that we are constrained to\r\nregard it as new. It was collected by Mr. C. H. Sternberg from the\r\nuppermost of the Niobrara beds, in the vicinity of the old town of\r\nSheridan. The character of the associated invertebrate fossils seems\r\nto indicate a different geological horizon, either the Fox Hills\r\ngroup, or transition beds to that group. The specimen consists of a\r\ncomplete lower jaw, quadrate, portions of the skull, the larger part\r\nof the vertebral column, and the incomplete hind and fore paddles. The\r\nvertebrae preserved are in two series, the one, numbering thirty-three,\r\ncontinuous with the skull; the other, sixty-three in number, all\r\nchevron caudals. The terminal caudals preserved indicate that there\r\nwere several more in life, perhaps five or ten; the first of the series\r\nwas evidently among the first of those which bore chevrons. Altogether\r\nthe tail may have had seventy-five chevron caudals. The lengths of\r\nthe two series are respectively seventy-one and seventy-two inches.\r\nAssuming that there was the same number of precaudal vertebrae as in\r\n_C. velox_, the entire vertebral column would have measured in life\r\nfifteen feet and four inches. The lower jaw shows the skull to have\r\nbeen very nearly twenty-four inches in length, making, for the animal\r\nwhen alive, a length of seventeen and one-half feet. This is one of\r\nthe largest species, and it is interesting to observe that the real\r\nsize here, as usually elsewhere among fossil vertebrates, is less than\r\nsupposed. It is doubtful whether there is a _Clidastes_ known that\r\nexceeded twenty feet in length.\r\n\r\nWhile the skeleton was only about one half longer than the specimen\r\nof _C. velox_ described in the foregoing pages, or of about the same\r\nlength as a very complete specimen of _C. tortor_ in the museum, the\r\nproportions of the animal were very much stouter. The figures given in\r\nplate VI of the twenty-fifth, or eighteenth dorsal, vertebra will show\r\nthe relations between length and breadth: it is upon these remarkably\r\nstout proportions, and the shape of the articular faces, as indicated\r\nby the figures and by the measurements appended, that the species is\r\nchiefly based. The articular surfaces of the basal caudal vertebrae are\r\nremarkably triangular in shape, with the angles rounded, and the sides\r\nof nearly equal length. This triangular shape is persistent for the\r\nfirst twenty of the series as they are preserved. The paddles, as shown\r\nin plates IV and V, show much stouter proportions than in either _C.\r\nvelox_ or _C. tortor_.\r\n\r\nThe species comes nearest to _C. stenops_ Cope, but it seems hardly the\r\nsame. It is, also, evidently allied to _C. dispar_ Marsh. From these\r\nand other described species, the following, extracted from the original\r\ndescriptions, will serve to show the differences, in comparison with\r\nthe specimen of _C. Westii_.\r\n\r\n=C. dispar.=\r\n\r\nThe articular faces in the cervicals are a broad transverse oval,\r\nfaintly emarginated above for the neural canal.

Snow in a recent trip to\r\nColorado, is an excellent representative collection of the Diptera.\r\nThe material for the following notes on Syrphidae is chiefly drawn\r\nfrom this collection. That such a collection affords so many points of\r\ninterest in this, one of the best studied families of North American\r\nDiptera, is an evidence of the rich field that is presented by this\r\nimportant and little-studied order of insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALLICERA.\r\n\r\n_Callicera_ Panzer, Fauna Germanica, 1806.\r\n\r\n_Callicera_ is a small genus hitherto supposed to be peculiar to\r\nEurope. The species are found in the high mountains, where the males\r\nare often taken while hovering in the air. The present collection\r\nincludes numerous specimens of a species taken near the summit of Mt.\r\nDeception, in Manitou Park, Colorado, at an altitude of nine thousand\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of members of this genus in the western part of the\r\nUnited States is a fact of especial interest and further substantiates\r\nthe rule that American forms common to Europe are more apt to occur\r\nin the western regions. _Arctophila flagrans_ Osten Sacken, is a case\r\nprecisely similar to the present one, belonging as it does to a small\r\nEuropean genus of mountain flies, and described from Colorado.\r\n\r\nAs the genus is a new one to our fauna, I here give an amended\r\ntranscription of the generic characters from Schiner’s Fauna Austriaca,\r\nto include the new species, which differs only in unimportant details.\r\n\r\n=Callicera.=\r\n\r\nRather large, stout, green or black species with metallic lustre and\r\nabundant, long pile. Head hemispherical, somewhat broader than the\r\nthorax. Antennae porrect, longer than the head, somewhat remote at\r\ntheir base, inserted upon a protuberance of the front; first joint\r\nsometimes elongate; second joint shorter than, or as long as, the first\r\njoint; third joint one to three times the length of the first two\r\njoints taken together, with a short, terminal style. Face broad, under\r\nthe antennae concave in profile; an obtuse tubercle below the middle;\r\non the sides thickly covered with pile. Proboscis rather prominent,\r\nwith broad labella. Eyes hairy, holoptic in the male. Abdomen\r\nelliptical, as long or longer than the thorax. Legs moderately strong.\r\nThird longitudinal vein straight, first posterior cell distally short\r\npetiolate; marginal cell open; cross-vein situated near the middle of\r\nthe discal cell, oblique.\r\n\r\n=Callicera montensis, n. sp.=, Plate vii, f. 4.\r\n\r\nMALE. Black, densely golden red pilose. Frontal triangle, face\r\nand cheeks deep black, shining, covered thickly with black pile, save\r\na median facial stripe. Antennae black, basal third of third joint on\r\nthe under side red; first joint short; second joint not more than half\r\nas long as the first; third joint three times as long as the first and\r\nsecond joints taken together; gradually broadened for a third of its\r\nlength, and then attenuated; style white. Eyes thickly clothed with\r\ngolden pile. Thorax and abdomen covered everywhere with long golden\r\nred pile. Legs black; tarsal joints below and at their articulations\r\nreddish. Wings nearly hyaline, brownish on the anterior basal portion;\r\nstigma yellow.\r\n\r\nLength 11 millimeters. Three specimens, Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe genus may be distinguished from _Pelecocera_, in Williston’s\r\ndichotomic table of the genera of North American Syrphidae, by the\r\npilose eyes.\r\n\r\n=Microdon megalogaster, n. sp.=, Plate vii, f. 1.\r\n\r\nMALE. Large, yellowish pilose species, in shape globose.\r\nAntennae reddish black, the first joint about as long as the following\r\ntwo together; second joint not one-third as long as the third. Face\r\ndark metallic green, shining, thickly covered with golden yellow\r\npile. Front black, with similar pile, narrowed in the middle. Eyes\r\nbare. Thorax and scutellum deep metallic green, with long, thick,\r\ngolden pile; scutellum gently emarginate, the small obtuse tubercles\r\napproximate. Abdomen short and broad, black, moderately shining; first\r\ntwo segments and the hypopygium somewhat green; pile at base yellow,\r\nelsewhere short, black. Legs black, with black pile; front tibiae\r\nand their metatarsi, on the inner side, with short golden pile; hind\r\nmetatarsi incrassate and longer than the three following joints taken\r\ntogether. Wings uniformly subinfuscate; veins at the outer part of the\r\nfirst posterior and discal cells sinuous and rounded.\r\n\r\nLength 12 millimeters. One specimen.\r\n\r\n=Chrysotoxum derivatum= Walker.\r\n\r\nEight specimens from Colorado, which vary not a little from each\r\nother and from Williston’s description. They seem to belong here,\r\nhowever, better than elsewhere. In one specimen, the second joint of\r\nthe antennae is shorter than the first, and only one-fourth the length\r\nof the third. In five examples the second abdominal cross-band is\r\nnot interrupted; in the others it is distinctly parted. In two, the\r\nthird band does not reach the yellow of the broad hind margin; in two\r\nothers it barely touches it; in five, the two bands broadly coalesce.\r\nThe yellow of the fifth segment, in four specimens, incloses a black,\r\ninverted V; in two others an inverted Y.\r\n\r\n=Paragus bicolor= Fabr.\r\n\r\nThree specimens, Colorado. These may be located under Schiner’s variety\r\n_taeniatus_.\r\n\r\n=Melanostoma stegnum= Say.\r\n\r\n      _Syrphus stegnus_ Say, Journ. Acad. Phil. vi, p. 163.\r\n      _Melanostoma tigrina_ Osten Sacken, Western Diptera, p. 323.\r\n      _Melanostoma stegnum_ Williston, Biol. Centr.-Amer. Diptera,\r\n         iii, p. 10.\r\n\r\nEleven specimens, Colorado, which answer well to the descriptions. The\r\nmetallic band of the fourth abdominal segment is sometimes interrupted,\r\nand there is usually a triangular opaque black spot near the anterior\r\nborder of the fifth segment. “The female, hitherto unknown, has the\r\nfront broad above, pollinose, except on the upper part, and with black\r\npile; the thorax more shining metallic blue; the tibiae yellow, and\r\non the third and fourth abdominal segments there is a narrow shining\r\nstripe, bisecting the black, as in the fourth segment of the male.\r\nThe male has some long black hairs on the outer side of the front and\r\nmiddle tibiae, which are inconspicuous in the female. It is evident,\r\nfrom the lighter color of the tibiae, that Say’s specimens were\r\nfemales.” Williston, l. c.\r\n\r\n=Melanostoma mellinum= Linne.\r\n\r\nA single female specimen from Manitou Park.\r\n\r\n=Melanostoma, n. sp.=?\r\n\r\nMALE. Face and front dark metallic blue, shining, thinly\r\ncovered with light-colored pollen; tubercle and epistoma black,\r\nshining, the former small. Antennae black, third joint yellowish red\r\nbelow, oblong. Pile of frontal and vertical triangles dusky. Thorax\r\nbronze-black, shining, sometimes bluish black, the pubescence white.\r\nHalteres yellowish. Abdomen long and narrow, with almost parallel\r\nsides; first segment metallic blue, shining; second segment opaque,\r\nor subopaque, black, with a light metallescent scallop on the sides,\r\nreaching to the distal third of the segment; third and fourth segments\r\nsimilar, marked anteriorly by a wide, interrupted, or subinterrupted\r\nblue fascia, deeply and widely emarginated, or concave behind; hind\r\nborder of the third, and sometimes of the second segment, narrowly\r\nbrown; fifth segment and the hypopygium metallic bluish green; sides\r\nof the abdomen with silvery white pile, longest and thickest at the\r\nbase; the blue marking are whitish pruinose. Femora, except the tip,\r\na broad ring on the tibiae, and the four posterior tarsi, black;\r\nelsewhere brownish or yellowish. Wings hyaline, stigma yellowish.\r\n\r\nLength 7-8 millimeters.\r\n\r\n=Eupeodes volucris=, Osten Sacken.\r\n\r\nNumerous specimens, Colorado.\r\n\r\n=Syrphus arcuatus= Fallen.\r\n\r\nFour specimens, Colorado. These specimens vary not a little from each\r\nother, and somewhat from the descriptions. One female is very small,\r\nnot over seven millimeters in length, and with the spots on the third\r\nand fourth abdominal segments hardly oblique. One male has the hind\r\nfemora black as far as the tip, while in three females the black does\r\nnot extend beyond the middle.\r\n\r\n=Syrphus disjectus= Williston.\r\n\r\nA single female specimen, from Colorado, agrees well with the\r\ndescription drawn from males. The pile of the thorax is more whitish\r\nthan orange-yellow, and there are light colored lateral margins on the\r\nanterior part of the thorax.\r\n\r\n=Syrphus ruficauda, n. sp.=, Plate vii, f. 3.\r\n\r\nMALE. Eyes bare. Face greenish yellow on the sides, yellow in\r\nthe middle; a rather broad black line marks the border of the mouth\r\nand is lost in the black of the cheeks. Frontal triangle yellow, with\r\nlong black pile. Antennae dark brown, more or less reddish below.\r\nPile of occiput light yellow. Dorsum of thorax deep metallic green,\r\nthe scutellum olivaceous yellow; both with light yellow pile. First\r\nsegment of the abdomen shining black; second segment opaque black,\r\nwith the lateral margins and hind border shining, and with a broad,\r\nyellow, interrupted band, not reaching the lateral margins; third\r\nsegment similar, but with the yellow band somewhat wider, interrupted\r\nor subinterrupted and slightly bilaterally oblique; fourth and fifth\r\nsegments orange-red, the sides narrowly black; the fourth segment shows\r\nindistinctly a broad interrupted band of a somewhat lighter color,\r\ncorresponding to the yellow bands of the preceding segments. Legs light\r\nbrown; basal third of the front and middle femora and basal half of the\r\nhind femora black. Wings hyaline, stigma yellowish.\r\n\r\nFEMALE. Head wanting. Thorax purplish brown. The yellow band\r\non the second abdominal segment narrower, the second band straight,\r\nnarrower and interrupted. Legs light brown, except the proximal end of\r\nthe femora, which is black.\r\n\r\nLength 9 millimeters. Three males and one female, Colorado.\r\n\r\n=Syrphus pauxillus= Williston.\r\n\r\nTwo specimens from Colorado undoubtedly come here. The species was\r\ndescribed from a single male specimen. A female specimen offers the\r\nfollowing differences or additions: Length nine millimeters, mesonotum\r\nmore greenish black or bronze, the pile obscure whitish; fifth\r\nabdominal segment without yellow spots on the anterior angles; legs\r\nyellow, with the basal half of the front and middle femora, the hind\r\nfemora except the tip, a broad band on the hind tibiae, and the hind\r\ntarsi, black.\r\n\r\n=Syrphus ribesii= Linne.\r\n\r\nFive specimens, Colorado.\r\n\r\n=Syrphus americanus= Wiedemann.\r\n\r\nNumerous specimens, Colorado.\r\n\r\n=Syrphus umbellatarum= Schiner.\r\n\r\nFive female specimens, Colorado. The only western locality heretofore\r\ngiven is Arizona (Williston).\r\n\r\n=Allograpta obliqua= Say.\r\n\r\nFive specimens, Colorado.\r\n\r\n=Mesogramma marginatum= Say.\r\n\r\nNumerous specimens from Colorado, showing very great variation.\r\n\r\n=Sphaerophoria cylindrica= Say.\r\n\r\nTwenty specimens, Colorado. I think the specimens belong here,\r\nthough a positive identification is hardly possible at present.\r\n\r\n=Rhingia nasica= Say.\r\n\r\nOne specimen, Colorado. This is the first time that this species\r\nhas been recorded from beyond the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n=Copestylum marginatum= Say.\r\n\r\nTwo specimens, Colorado, representing the extremes of variation in the\r\nspecies. The male corresponds to _C. lentum_ Williston. Specimens of\r\nthis species were bred from _Opuntia missouriensis_, in company with\r\nothers of _Volucella fasciata_ Macq.\r\n\r\n=Sericomyia militaris= Walker.\r\n\r\nSixteen specimens from Minnesota and Colorado vary in the markings of\r\nthe second abdominal segment, and in the color of the legs. Some have\r\nno spots at all on the second segment; in others the two yellow dots\r\nare conspicuous, approaching, in size and shape, the markings of the\r\nthird segment. The tibiae vary from light yellow to reddish brown.\r\n\r\n=Brachyopa cynops, n. sp.=, plate vii, f. 2.\r\n\r\nHead light yellowish brown, largely concealed beneath light glistening\r\npollen; the shining ground color shows just above the antennae and in\r\na stripe on the cheeks, extending from the eye to the mouth opening.\r\nAntennae wanting.

Scutellum light brown, with yellowish\r\npollen. Abdomen but little longer than broad; yellowish gray pollinose;\r\nsecond segment with a circular brown spot in the anterior corners; the\r\ntwo following segments are marked with corresponding elliptical spots,\r\nand, in the middle of the anterior border with a triangular spot; on\r\nthe fifth segment are two small round spots. Legs uniformly reddish\r\nbrown, with light colored pollen and short whitish pile. Wing hyaline,\r\ndistinctly clouded at anterior cross-vein, on the veins at the anterior\r\nouter corner of the discal cell and on the ultimate section of the\r\nfourth vein; posterior cross-vein about as long as the penultimate\r\nsection of the fourth vein, the included angle obtuse.\r\n\r\nLength 5 millimeters. One specimen, Colorado.\r\n\r\n=Eristalis latifrons= Loew.\r\n\r\nNumerous specimens, Colorado. The commonest Syrphid of the mountain\r\nmeadows. Some specimens have very indistinct brownish spots on the\r\nsecond abdominal segment, and, when this is the case, the middle of the\r\nwing generally shows a brown spot, and brown clouds along the anterior\r\nveins between the spot and the base of the wing.\r\n\r\n=Eristalis brousi= Williston.\r\n\r\nOne male specimen, Colorado.\r\n\r\n=Helophilus latifrons= Loew.\r\n\r\nNumerous specimens, Colorado.\r\n\r\n=Xylota flavitibia= Bigot.\r\n\r\nEight specimens, Colorado.

The only other known\r\nspecimen of this species is the type, at Washington, from Connecticut.\r\n\r\n=Spilomyia quadrifasciata= Say.\r\n\r\nSeven specimens, Lawrence, Kansas, (F. H. Snow and E. S. Tucker). The\r\nspecies has not hitherto been recorded west of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes on Melitera Dentata Grote.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY VERNON L. KELLOGG.\r\n\r\nWITH PLATE VIII.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the Entomological Club of the A. A. A. S., held in\r\nAugust, 1891, at Washington, Dr. Riley called attention to the habits\r\nof _Melitera prodenialis_ Walker. The larvae burrow into and feed upon\r\nthe fleshy leaves of the prickly pear, _Opuntia_. Dr. Riley’s specimens\r\ncame from Florida. Prof. J. B. Smith has recently bred the moth from\r\nthe prickly pear in New Jersey. His notes were presented at the same\r\nmeeting of the Club, and the brief references to the interesting\r\nnotes of Doctors Riley and Smith, made in the Canadian Entomologist\r\n(v. xxiii, num. 11, pp. 242 and 256), suggest the presentation of the\r\nfollowing notes on _Melitera dentata_ Grote, the western species of\r\nthis Phycitid genus.\r\n\r\nChancellor F. H. Snow, of this University, while investigating a\r\ngrasshopper “outbreak” (_Dissosteira longipennis_) in eastern Colorado\r\nin July, 1891, noted the withered and dying condition of many leaves\r\nof the common prickly pear cactus (_Opuntia missouriensis_), and\r\non examining the leaves found in them certain large, naked, bluish\r\nlarvae. The larvae were imbedded in the fleshy leaves, eating away the\r\nsoft inner tissue. The hollowed-out spaces were nearly filled with\r\nirregularly spherical, yellowish, translucent casts. The attacked\r\nleaves were withered and brown without. Prof. Snow took a few leaves\r\nand larvae on July 16, near Arriba, Colorado, and brought them to the\r\nlaboratory.\r\n\r\nThe larvae were put into breeding-cage on July 18. On July 28 one\r\nlarva had spun up and pupated in a corner of the cage behind a small\r\nporcelain dish. Another had made a cocoon in a broken, empty pupa-case\r\nof _Eacles imperialis_, but died before pupating. On August —— the\r\nadults appeared, and have been determined by Prof. J. B. Smith as _M.\r\ndentata_, Grote. As I am aware of no description of the earlier stages\r\nof this species, I record the following notes of description:\r\n\r\nEGG. About 1-1.2 millimeters in diameter, surface with broad,\r\nmeridian-like furrows from one pole for about one-third of the distance\r\nto the other pole. Color, creamy white.\r\n\r\nLARVA. Food plant, _Opuntia missouriensis_, prickly pear\r\ncactus, burrowing into the fleshy leaves and eating the soft,\r\nsucculent, inner tissues. Length, 40 millimeters. Five pairs of\r\nprolegs. Color, one specimen, ultramarine blue; skin, semi-transparent\r\nand shining anteriorly, dead blue on dorsum; second specimen, buffy\r\nwith a bluish suffusion, blue between segments, prolegs bluish, and\r\nlast abdominal segment blue, especially below; skin more opaque than\r\nin first specimen. No pronounced markings of skin; spiracles shining\r\nblack and present on first thoracic and first to tenth abdominal\r\nsegments. Head flattened, slightly narrower than first thoracic\r\nsegment, umber. Prothoracic shield well marked, brownish black; anal\r\nshield, smoky brownish. Clothing, limited to tubercled hairs sparsely\r\ndistributed as follows: a subdorsal line of small tubercles, two\r\ntubercles to a segment, each tubercle bearing three short, fine hairs;\r\na supra-stigmatic line, one tubercle to each segment, each tubercle\r\nbearing three to four fine hairs; a similar infra-stigmatic line; a\r\nsub-ventral line of tubercles, bearing usually four fine hairs, the\r\ntubercles of the three thoracic segments in this line situated at base\r\nof legs outside, and similarly as to the prolegs on the third to sixth\r\nabdominal segments. The tubercles in all the lines are faintly smoky.\r\nThe larva is rather heavy, and rotund in form, tapering toward both\r\nhead and posterior segment. It moves with a lumbering gait, but rather\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nCHRYSALIS. Length, 20 millimeters; in cocoon of silk, loosely\r\ncovered with small dirt-masses. As made in the breeding cage the\r\ncocoons were above ground, but concealed under or in available objects.\r\n\r\nADULT. The adults obtained from the breeding cage, (there\r\nare no others in our collection), are easily distinguished from\r\n_prodenialis_ Wlk., by the much stronger dentations of the outer line\r\nof the primaries. Prof. Smith kindly sent a specimen of _prodenialis_\r\ntaken at Ocean Grove, New Jersey, for comparison. The row of marginal\r\nblack spots on the primaries which Hulst (Tran. Am. Ent. Soc., v.\r\nxvii, p. 172) mentions as distinctive of dentata is as pronounced in\r\nProf. Smith’s specimen of _prodenialis_ as in our _dentata_. The much\r\nlighter color of the primaries, head and thorax in dentata as mentioned\r\nby Hulst is characteristic. An interesting feature in the venation of\r\nthe hind wings in our bred specimens of _dentata_ is the considerable\r\ncoalescence of the sub-costal and costal veins. Vein five is wanting,\r\nas mentioned by Hulst. In addition, there is further departure from\r\na normal venation, in that vein seven after rising with six from its\r\nstem, (Hulst says: “Six short stemmed with seven”), coalesces for a\r\nshort distance with eight and then runs free to the margin. Behind the\r\nforking of seven and six the stem (remnant of sub-costal) unites with\r\nthe costal, and its basal portion is wholly merged with the forward\r\nvein. This partial disappearance of the sub-costal seems to be shared\r\nby _prodenialis_ and is probably characteristic of the genus.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith, as recorded in the Canadian Naturalist, v. viii, p. 242,\r\n(1891), bred several specimens of _Volucella fasciata_, a Syrphid fly,\r\nfrom the same prickly pear leaves in which the _Melitera_ larvae were\r\nliving. It is interesting to note that pupariae and later, adults of\r\n_Volucella fasciata_ and _Copestylum marginatum_, a closely allied\r\nSyrphid, were noted in the Opuntia leaves from which _M. dentata_ was\r\nbred.

Head black; front, below the vertical callosity,\r\nexcept a crescentic space above the base of the antennae, opaque;\r\nface, on the sides and in the depression, with a conspicuous, light\r\nyellowish silvery reflection; in an oblique light from above the\r\nground-color wholly concealed. Antennae black; the reddish first joint\r\nabout two-thirds the length of the third joint; the third joint about\r\ntwo-thirds of the length of the slender second joint; third joint\r\nof the style with a short bristly extremity. Thorax black, lightly\r\npollinose, opaque; on the front margin, and near the humeri, velvety;\r\nin the middle in front distinctly whitish when seen from behind.\r\nAbdomen black, subshining; second segment deep opaque black, save on\r\nthe anterior part, where it is whitish pollinose; ventral process of\r\nthe fifth segment small. Legs black; the tarsi and claws (save their\r\nextreme tips) light yellow; pulvilli very large, yellow; the tarsi\r\ndilated. Wings unequally brown in front, scarcely extending beyond the\r\nthird vein, save in the first posterior cell; the costal cell and the\r\nouter part of the wing in front of the third vein of a lighter color.\r\n\r\nLength 12 millimeters. One specimen, Chapada, H. H. Smith.\r\n\r\n6. =Conops inornatus, n. sp.=\r\n\r\nMALE. Front black, shining, the vertical callosity reddish.\r\nFace yellow, with golden pollen on the sides extending up on the\r\nlower part of the front. Cheeks wholly yellow. Thorax black, shining,\r\nlightly pollinose; margins of the thorax and of the scutellum with\r\nmoderately large bristles. Abdomen slender, black, shining; the narrow\r\nhind margins of the third and fourth segments, the fifth on the sides\r\nand behind, and the sixth nearly wholly, light golden pollinose. Legs\r\nbrown; base of tibiae yellow; basal joints of the tarsi yellowish.\r\nWings subhyaline, without distinct picture, though the color is more\r\nintense in front; yellow in the costal cell.\r\n\r\nFEMALE. Wings distinctly brown before the third vein and\r\nin the basal cells and proximal portion of the discal cell. Abdomen\r\ndiffusely whitish pollinose behind; the second segment largely reddish;\r\nventral process of the fifth segment small.\r\n\r\nLength 10 millimeters. Two specimens, Chapada, H. H. Smith.\r\n\r\n7. =Conops ornatus, n. sp.=\r\n\r\nMALE. Vertical callosity reddish; below it an opaque black\r\nband, connected in the middle with a V-shaped spot about the base of\r\nthe antennae; the front elsewhere, and the face for the greater part,\r\nlight yellow, the sides of the latter with a broad silvery sheen.\r\nCheeks black. Antennae red; the first joint a little shorter than the\r\nthird joint; second joint about twice the length of the first; style\r\nshort, thick. Thorax black, opaque; near the humeri and behind, as\r\nalso on the scutellum, thickly golden pollinose; pleurae diffusely\r\npollinose. Abdomen opaque black; the hind margin of the first three\r\nsegments, and the remainder of the abdomen, save spots on the sides of\r\nthe fourth and fifth segments, thickly light golden pollinose. Legs\r\nreddish brown, the base of the tibiae and the basal joints of the tarsi\r\nyellowish. The brown of the wings extends to the third vein and through\r\nthe middle of the first posterior cell; costal and subcostal cells\r\nlighter colored.\r\n\r\nLength 11 millimeters. Two specimens, Chapada, H. H. Smith.\r\n\r\n8. =Conops parvus, n. sp.=\r\n\r\nFEMALE. Closely allied to _C. sylvosus_ Williston, but differs\r\nin the lighter colored antennae and their more elongated third joint,\r\nwhich is as long as the first two joints together; in the wings being\r\nwholly grayish hyaline, save a quadrate brown spot in front a little\r\nbeyond the middle; and in the lighter colored legs and abdomen. The\r\nproboscis is as long as the antennae; the legs are brown or brownish\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nLength 8 millimeters. Two specimens, Chapada, H. H. Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanation of Plates.\r\n\r\n     PLATE I. Skull of _Pteranodon_ sp., one-fifth\r\n        natural size.\r\n\r\n     PLATE II.
