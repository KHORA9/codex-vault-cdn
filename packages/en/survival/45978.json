It is the second in the series of fruit publications which is now\r\nbeing prepared under your authority.\r\n\r\nThis volume is the result of years of recorded observations by members\r\nof the Station staff, to which has been added the collection of a large\r\namount of information from practical growers of the grape. Every effort\r\nhas been made to insure completeness and accuracy of statement, and to\r\nmake the work a reliable guide as to all the varieties of grapes that\r\nare likely to meet the attention of New York grape-growers. It is\r\nbelieved that this volume will occupy a useful place in grape literature\r\nand will be serviceable to an important industry in this State.\r\n\r\nW. H. JORDAN,\r\n\r\n_Director_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of _The Grapes of New York_ is to record the state of\r\ndevelopment of American grapes. The title implies that the work is being\r\ndone for a locality but in this matter New York is representative of the\r\nwhole country. The contents are: Brief historical narratives of Old\r\nWorld and New World grapes; an account of the grape regions and of\r\ngrape-growing in New York, with statistics relating to the grape, wine\r\nand grape juice industries in this State; a discussion of the species of\r\nAmerican grapes; and the synonymy, bibliography, economic status, and\r\nfull descriptions of all of the important varieties of American grapes.\r\nIn the footnotes will be found brief biographical sketches of those\r\npersons who have contributed most to the evolution of the grape and to\r\ngrape-growing in America and some historical and descriptive notices of\r\ncertain things pertaining to the grape which do not belong in the text\r\nand yet serve to give a better understanding of it or otherwise add to\r\nthe completeness of the book. Color-plates are shown of varieties which\r\nfrom various standpoints are considered most important.\r\n\r\nIn the brief account of the Old World grape there is little that is new.\r\nIts history is on record from the earliest times in the literature of\r\nnearly all civilized peoples. A few facts, selected here and there, have\r\nbeen taken to serve as an introduction to the accounts of the New World\r\ngrapes. So, too, the history of the American grape has been written by\r\nothers and, here, only the main facts have been set down as recorded in\r\nthe score or more books dealing with this fruit. A few excursions have\r\nbeen made in hitherto unexplored fields. The purpose of these historical\r\nsketches is to give the reader a proper perspective of the work in hand.\r\n\r\nThe grape is probably influenced to a greater degree by soil, climate,\r\nand culture than any other fruit, and a discussion of its status cannot\r\nbe complete without due consideration of the environment in which it is\r\ngrowing. Hence there is included as full an account of grape-growing and\r\nof the grape regions in New York as space permits. This part of the work\r\nmay serve the prospective planter somewhat in selecting soils and\r\nlocations but as it is not written with this as a chief end, it falls\r\nfar short of some of the standard treatises on grape culture in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nComparatively few statistics are given, only those which are necessary\r\nto show the volume of grape products and the extent of the vineyards in\r\nthe State and country at the present time. The figures for the whole\r\ncountry are surpassed by those of no other native fruit, and only by\r\ncorn and tobacco among all the domesticated native plants.\r\n\r\nThe botany of the grape has been the most perplexing problem to deal\r\nwith in the preparation of this work. The variability of the grape is so\r\ngreat, and the variations are so often toward closely related species,\r\nthat it is difficult to tell where one species ends and another begins.\r\nThis, of course, has led to differences in opinions. Then, too, the\r\nseveral monographers have not had the same specimens to work with; men\r\ndo not have the same powers of discrimination; and the arrangement of\r\nbotanical groups, based upon the characters of the plants and the theory\r\nof descent with adaptive modifications, is not governed by definite\r\nrules; hence botanical divisions are arbitrary and differ with the\r\njudgments of the botanists who make them. For these reasons we have as\r\nmany different arrangements of species of grapes as there are men who\r\nhave worked them over.\r\n\r\nSince this work is not written from the standpoint of the botanist but\r\nof the horticulturist, no effort has been made to revise the botany of\r\nthe grape. But it has been necessary to select some arrangement of\r\nspecies in order to make such disposition of the cultivated varieties\r\nthat their characters and relationships can best be shown. In making a\r\nchoice of the several recent classifications of American grapes, three\r\nmain considerations have been in mind: First, that the arrangement\r\nshould separate the species in the genus freely, thus decreasing the\r\nsize of the groups so that they may be more easily studied. Second, that\r\nit should show as clearly as possible the relationships of the various\r\ngroups and of their development--the evolution of the grape. Third, that\r\nit be an arrangement in good standing with botanists and\r\nhorticulturists. After having examined all American classifications of\r\ngrapes and all recent European ones, Bailey's classification, as set\r\nforth in his monograph of the Vitaceae in _Gray's Synoptical Flora_, in\r\nthe _Evolution of our Native Fruits_, and in the _Cyclopedia of American\r\nHorticulture_, was adopted.\r\n\r\n_The Grapes of New York_ makes its chief contribution to the pomology of\r\nthe country in the description of varieties. The authors have tried to\r\nstudy varieties from every point of view, not alone nor chiefly, it must\r\nbe said, with regard to their cultural value; for most of the varieties\r\npass out of cultivation and such information would be worthless within a\r\nfew years at most. But, rather, the effort has been to determine what\r\nelementary or unit characters the grape possesses as shown in its\r\nbotanical and horticultural groups. The Twentieth Century begins with\r\nthe unanimous judgment of scientists that the characters of plants are\r\nindependent entities which are thrown into various relationships with\r\neach other in individuals and groups of individuals. This conception of\r\nunit characters lies at the foundation of plant improvement. We are but\r\nbeginning the breeding of American grapes and it has seemed to the\r\nwriter that the most important part of this undertaking is to discover\r\nand record as far as possible these unit characters of grapes, thereby\r\naiding to furnish a foundation for grape-breeding. The great problem of\r\nplant-breeding in the future will be to correlate the characters known\r\nto exist in the plant being improved; we must know what these are before\r\nwe begin to combine and rearrange them.\r\n\r\nThe varieties are arranged alphabetically throughout, though, were\r\npresent knowledge exact enough, it would be far better to arrange them\r\nin natural groups. Such a classification is probably possible, but it\r\nremains for future workers to search out the relationships which the\r\nstructures and qualities of plant and fruit indicate and to group the\r\nvarieties naturally rather than alphabetically. Wherever possible in\r\nthis work, however, the relationships of varieties have been indicated\r\nas fully as knowledge permits, thus making a start toward natural\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nIn the lists of synonyms given, all known names for a variety used in\r\nthe American literature of the grape are brought together. These lists\r\nought to be useful in correcting and simplifying the nomenclature of the\r\ngrape which, like that of all of our fruits, is in more or less\r\nconfusion. It is hoped that the work may become a standard guide, for\r\nsome time to come at least, in the identification of varieties and in\r\nnomenclature, and that it will aid originators of new grapes and\r\nnurserymen in avoiding the duplication of names. In matters pertaining\r\nto nomenclature, the revised rules of the American Pomological Society\r\nhave been followed, though in a few cases it has not seemed best to make\r\nchanges which their strict observance would have required. The necessity\r\nfor rules is shown by an examination of the synonymy of any considerable\r\nnumber of varieties as given in the body of the work. In some cases\r\nvarieties have from ten to twenty names and very often different\r\nvarieties are found to have the same name. This chaotic condition is\r\nconfusing and burdensome and it has been one of the aims in the\r\npreparation of the work to set straight the horticultural nomenclature\r\nof the grape, thus lessening the difficulty and uncertainty of\r\nidentification and making the comparative study of varieties easier.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible, and not worth while, could it be done, to give\r\nall of the references to be found in even the standard grape literature.\r\nOnly such have been given as have been found useful by the writers or as\r\nwould serve to give the future student of the literature of grape\r\nvarieties a working basis.\r\n\r\nA brief history of each variety is given so far as it can be determined\r\nby correspondence and from grape literature. In these historical\r\nsketches the originator and his method of work justly receive most\r\nattention. The place, date and circumstances of origin, the distributor,\r\nand the present distribution of the variety, are given when known and\r\nare of about equal importance in the plan of this work.\r\n\r\nThe technical descriptions of grapes are all first-hand and made by\r\nmembers of the present horticultural department of the Station from\r\nliving plants. But rarely has it been necessary to go to books for any\r\none character of a vine or fruit though the leading authorities have\r\nbeen consulted in the final writing of the descriptions and\r\nmodifications made when the weight of authority has been against the\r\nrecords of the Station. Some differences must be expected between\r\ndescriptions of varieties made in different years, different localities\r\nand by different men. For most part the varieties described are growing\r\non the Station grounds but every opportunity has been taken to study\r\nseveral specimens of each variety and especially of the fruit. In many\r\ninstances the descriptions have been submitted to the originators,\r\nintroducers, or to some recognized grape specialist.\r\n\r\nA number of considerations have governed the selection of varieties for\r\nfull descriptions. These are: First, the value of a variety for the\r\ncommercial or amateur grower for any part of the State as determined by\r\nthe records of this Station, by reports collected from over 2000\r\ngrape-growers, and by published information from whatever source.\r\nSecond, the probable value of new sorts as determined by their behavior\r\nelsewhere. Third, to show combinations of species or varieties, or new\r\ncharacters hitherto unknown in fruit or vine, or to portray the range in\r\nvariation, or to suggest to the plant-breeder a course of future\r\ndevelopment. Fourth, a few sorts have been described because of their\r\nhistorical value--for the retrospection of the grape-grower of the\r\npresent and the future. It is needless to say that many of the varieties\r\ndescribed are worthless to the cultivator.\r\n\r\nIn all of the descriptions the effort has been to depict living plants\r\nand not things existing only in books; to give a pen picture of them\r\nthat will show all of their characters. An attempt has been made, too,\r\nto show the breeding of the plants, their relationships; to show what\r\ncombination of characters exist in the different groups of varieties; to\r\ndesignate, as far as possible, the plastic types; in short to show\r\ngrapes as variable, plastic plants capable of further improvement and\r\nnot as unchangeable organisms restricted to definite forms.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the color-plates will be of great service in\r\nillustrating the text. All possible means at the command of photography\r\nand color printing have been used to make them exact reproductions. The\r\nspecimens, too, have been selected with the utmost care. In preparing\r\nthese illustrations the thought has been that technical descriptions,\r\nhowever simply written, are not easily understood, and that the readiest\r\nmeans of comparison and identification for the average reader would be\r\nfound in the color-plates. Through these and the accompanying\r\ndescriptions it is hoped that all who desire may acquire, with time and\r\npatience, a knowledge of the botanical characters of grapes and thereby\r\nan understanding of the technical descriptions. The plates have been\r\nmade under the personal supervision of the writer.\r\n\r\nWith all care possible, due allowance must yet be made for the failure\r\nto reproduce nature exactly in the color-plates. The plates are several\r\nremoves from the fruit. Four negatives were taken of each subject with\r\na color filter between the lens and the fruit. A copper plate was made\r\nfrom each negative, one for each of the four colors, red, yellow, black\r\nand blue. The color-plates in the book are composed of these four\r\ncolors, combined by the camera, the artist, the horticulturist and the\r\nprinter. With all of these agencies between the fruit and the\r\ncolor-plate they could not be exact reproductions. It must ever be in\r\nmind, too, that grapes grown in different localities vary more or less\r\nin all characters and that the reproduction can represent the fruit from\r\nbut one locality. The specimens from which the plates were made came for\r\nmost part from the Station grounds. The illustrations are life size and\r\nas far as possible from average specimens.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments are due to Professor Spencer A.

YORK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE OLD WORLD GRAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nA single species of the grape is cultivated in the Old World. This is\r\n_Vitis vinifera_, the grape of ancient and modern agriculture, the vine\r\nof the allegories of sacred record and of the myths, fables and poetry\r\nof the Old World countries. It is the vine which Adam and Eve cared\r\nfor:--\r\n\r\n    \"* * * they led the vine\r\n     To wed his elm; * * *.\" _Milton._\r\n\r\nIt is the vine which Noah planted after the deluge; the vine of Judah\r\nand Israel, and of the promised land. Dionysus of the Greeks, Bacchus of\r\nthe Romans, found the grape and devoted his life to spreading it; for\r\nwhich he was raised to the rank of a deity--god of vines and vintages.\r\nThe history of this grape is as old as that of mankind. It has followed\r\ncivilized man from place to place throughout the world and is one of the\r\nchief cultivated plants of temperate climates. This fruit of sacred and\r\nprofane literature has so impressed itself upon the human mind that when\r\nwe think or speak of the grape, or vine, it is the Old World species,\r\nthe vine of antiquity, that presents itself.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Old World grape goes back to prehistoric times. Seeds\r\nof the grape are found in the remains of the Swiss lake dwellings of the\r\nBronze Period and entombed with the mummies of Egypt. Its printed\r\nhistory is as old as that of man and is interwritten with it. According\r\nto the botanists, the probable habitat of _Vitis vinifera_ is the region\r\nabout the Caspian Sea.[1] From here it was carried eastward into Asia\r\nand westward into Europe and Africa. It is probable that the\r\nPhoenicians, the earliest navigators, tradesmen and colonizers on the\r\nMediterranean, carried it to the countries bordering on this sea. Grape\r\nculture was developed in this region a thousand years before Christ,\r\nfor Hesiod, who wrote at this time, gave directions for the care of the\r\nvine which need to be changed but little for present practice in Europe.\r\nPliny, writing a thousand years after, quotes Hesiod as an authority on\r\nvine culture. Vergil and Pliny, during Christ's time, gave specific\r\ndirections for the care of the vine. Vergil describes fifteen varieties\r\nwhile Pliny gives even fuller descriptions of ninety-one varieties and\r\ndistinguishes fifty kinds of wine.\r\n\r\nThe authentic written history of the grape and of its culture really\r\nbegins with Vergil. Many other writers, Greeks and Romans, had discussed\r\nthe vine, but none so fully nor so well as Vergil in his Georgics, of\r\nwhich the parts having to do with the vine may still be read with profit\r\nby the grape-grower; as, for example, the following[2] in which he tells\r\nhow to cultivate and train:--\r\n\r\n    \"Be mindful, when thou hast entomb'd the shoot,\r\n     With store of earth around to feed the root;\r\n     With iron teeth of rakes and prongs, to move\r\n     The crusted earth, and loosen it above.\r\n     Then exercise thy sturdy steers to plow\r\n     Between thy vines, and teach the feeble row\r\n     To mount on reeds, and wands, and, upward led,\r\n     On ashen poles to raise their forky head,\r\n     On these new crutches let them learn to walk,\r\n     'Till, swerving upwards with a stronger stalk,\r\n     They brave the winds, and, clinging to their guide,\r\n     On tops of elms at length triumphant ride.\"[3]\r\n\r\nHis directions for pruning are equally fitting for present practice:--\r\n\r\n    \"But in their tender nonage, while they spread\r\n     Their springing leaves, and lift their infant head,\r\n     And upward while they shoot in open air,\r\n     Indulge their childhood, and the nurslings spare;\r\n     Nor exercise thy rage on new-born life;\r\n     But let thy hand supply the pruning knife,\r\n     And crop luxuriant stragglers, nor be loth\r\n     To strip the branches of their leafy growth.\r\n     But when the rooted vines with steady hold\r\n     Can clasp their elms, then, husbandman, be bold\r\n     To lop the disobedient boughs, that strayed\r\n     Beyond their ranks; let crooked steel invade\r\n     The lawless troops, which discipline disclaim,\r\n     And their surperfluous growth with rigor tame.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of the development of the vine from Vergil's time through\r\nthe early centuries of the Christian Era and of the Middle Ages to our\r\nown day, is largely the history of agriculture in the southern European\r\ncountries; for the vine during this period has been the chief cultivated\r\nplant of the Greek and Latin nations. This history should furnish most\r\ninstructive lessons in grape-growing and in grape-breeding.\r\n\r\nBut interesting and profitable as a detailed account of the development\r\nof the Old World grape would be, the brief outline in the few preceding\r\nparagraphs must suffice for this work. The reader who desires further\r\ninformation may find it in the agricultural literature in many languages\r\nand dating back two thousand years.\r\n\r\nWhat are the characters of the European grape and how does it differ\r\nfrom the native grapes of America? The Old World grape is grown for\r\nwine; the American grapes for the table. The differences in the fruit of\r\nthe vines of the two continents are largely the differences necessary\r\nfor the two distinct purposes for which they are grown. The varieties of\r\n_Vitis vinifera_ have a higher sugar and solid content than do those of\r\nthe American species. Because of this richness in sugar they not only\r\nmake better wine but keep much longer and can be made into raisins. The\r\nAmerican grapes do not keep well and do not make good raisins. Taken as\r\na whole the European varieties are better flavored, possessing a more\r\ndelicate and a richer vinous flavor, a more agreeable aroma, and they\r\nlack the acidity and somewhat obnoxious foxy odor and taste of many\r\nAmerican varieties. It is true that there is a disagreeable astringency\r\nin some Vinifera grapes and that many varieties are without character of\r\nflavor, yet, all and all, the species produces by far the better\r\nflavored fruit. On the other hand, American table grapes are more\r\nrefreshing; one does not tire of them so quickly as they do not cloy the\r\nappetite as do the richer grapes; and the unfermented juice makes a much\r\nmore pleasant drink. The characteristic flavor and aroma of the\r\nvarieties of _Vitis labrusca_, our most commonly cultivated native\r\nspecies, are often described by the terms \"foxy\"[4] or \"musky.\" If not\r\ntoo pronounced this foxiness is often very agreeable though, as with the\r\nflavor in many exotic fruits, the liking for it must often be acquired,\r\nand of course may never be acquired; yet the universal condemnation of\r\nthis taste by the French and some other Europeans is sheer prejudice.\r\nThe bunches and berries of the European grape are larger, more\r\nattractive in appearance, and are borne in greater quantity, vine for\r\nvine or acre for acre. The pulp and skin of the berries of _Vitis\r\nvinifera_ are less objectionable than those of any native species and\r\nthe pulp separates more easily from the seeds. The berries do not shell\r\nfrom the stem nearly so quickly, hence the bunches ship better.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the vines, those of the Old World grape are more compact in\r\nhabit, make a shorter and stouter annual growth, therefore require less\r\npruning and training. The roots are fleshier, and more fibrous. The\r\nspecies, taken as a whole, is adapted to far more kinds of soil, and to\r\nmuch greater differences in environment, and is more easily propagated\r\nfrom cuttings, than most of the species of American grapes. The\r\ncultivated forms of the wild vines of this country have few points of\r\nsuperiority over their relative from the eastern hemisphere, but these\r\nfew are such as to make them now and probably ever the only grapes\r\npossible to cultivate in America in the commercial vineyards east of the\r\nRocky Mountains. Indeed, but for the fortunate discovery that the vine\r\nof _Vitis vinifera_ could be grown on the roots of any one of several\r\nspecies of the American grapes, the vineyards of the Old World grape\r\nwould have been almost wholly destroyed within the last half century\r\nbecause of one of its weaknesses. This destructive agent is the\r\nphylloxera,[5] a tiny plant louse working on the leaf and root of the\r\ngrape, which in a few years wholly destroys the European vine but does\r\ncomparatively little harm to most of the American vines. Three other\r\npests are much more harmful in the Old World vineyards than to the vines\r\nof the New World; these are black-rot (_Guignardia bidwellii_ (Ell.) V.\r\n& R.), downy mildew (_Plasmopara viticola_ (B. & C.) Berl. & De Toni),\r\nand powdery mildew (_Uncinula necator_ (Schw.) Burr.).\r\n\r\nThe susceptibility of the Old World grape to these parasites debars it\r\nfrom cultivation in eastern America and so effectually that there is but\r\nlittle hope of any pure-bred variety of it ever being grown in this\r\nregion. American viticulture must, therefore, depend upon the native\r\nspecies for its varieties, though it may be hoped that by combining the\r\ngood qualities of the foreign grape with those of one or several of the\r\nspecies of this country, or by combining and rearranging the best\r\ncharacters of the native species, we may in time secure varieties equal\r\nin all respects to those of the Old World. The comparative resistance of\r\nthe American species to the phylloxera, the mildews, and black-rot has\r\nbeen due to natural selection in the contest that has been waged for\r\nuntold ages between host and parasite. The fact that the native species\r\nhave been able to survive and thrive is a guarantee of the permanence of\r\nthe resistance thus acquired.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the Old World grape is debarred from cultivation in\r\neastern America. It is worth while considering how thorough the attempts\r\nto grow it in this region have been and to give a more exact account of\r\nthe failures and their causes, for there are yet those who are\r\nattempting its culture with the hope that we may sometime grow some\r\noffshoot of _Vitis vinifera_ in the region under consideration.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the first European grapes planted in what is now\r\nAmerican soil, were grown by the Spanish _padres_ at the old missions in\r\nNew Mexico, Arizona and California. Early accounts of some of these\r\nmissions speak of grapes which must have been planted before settlements\r\nwere made in eastern America. We need take no further account of these\r\nvineyards except to say that in this region the European grape has\r\nalways been grown successfully, and that under the skilled hands of the\r\nmission fathers, ever notable vineyardists and wine-makers, these early\r\nplantings must have succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe English were the first to plant the Old World grape in the territory\r\nin which this species fails because of the attacks of native parasites.\r\nLord Delaware seems to have been the original promoter of grape-growing\r\nin the New World. In 1616 he wrote to the London Company urging the\r\nculture of the grape as a possible source of revenue for the new\r\ncolony.[6] His letter seems to have been convincing, for it is on record\r\nthat the Company in 1619 sent a number of French vine-dressers and a\r\ncollection of the best varieties of the grapes of France to Virginia.\r\nThe Colonial Assembly showed quite as much solicitude in encouraging the\r\ncultivation of the vine as did the Company in London. The year of the\r\nimportation of vines and vine-dressers, 1619, the Assembly passed an act\r\ncompelling every householder to plant ten cuttings and to protect them\r\nfrom injury and stated that the landowners were expected to acquire the\r\nart of dressing a vineyard, either through instruction or by\r\nobservation. The Company, to increase the interest in vine-growing,\r\nshowed marked favors to all who undertook it with zealousness; promises\r\nof servants, the most valuable gifts that could be made to the\r\ncolonists, were frequent. Under the impulse thus given vineyards were\r\nplanted containing as many as ten thousand vines.[7]\r\n\r\nIn spite of a rich soil, congenial climate, and skilled vine-dressers,\r\nnothing of importance came from the venture, some of the historians of\r\nthe time attributing the failure to the massacre of 1622; others to poor\r\nmanagement of the vines; and still others to disagreements between the\r\nEnglish and their French vine-dressers, who, it was claimed, concealed\r\ntheir knowledge because they worked as slaves. It is probable that the\r\nlatter explanation was fanciful but the former must have been real for\r\nwe are told that the farms and outlying settlements were abandoned after\r\nthe great massacre. But the colony could hardly have recovered from the\r\nravages of the Indians before efforts to force the colonists to grow\r\ngrapes were again made; for in 1623 the Assembly passed a law that for\r\nevery four men in the colony a garden should be laid off a part of which\r\nwas to be planted to vines.[8]\r\n\r\nIn 1639 the Assembly again tried to encourage vine-growing by\r\nlegislative enactment, this time with an act giving a premium to\r\nsuccessful grape-growers.[9] Later, about 1660, a premium of ten\r\nthousand pounds of tobacco was offered in Virginia for each \"two tunne\r\nof wine\" from grapes raised in the colony. Shortly after, some wine was\r\nexported to England but whether made from wild plants or cultivated\r\nones does not appear. In spite of the encouragement of legislative acts,\r\ngrape-growing did not flourish in Virginia.[10] The fact that tobacco\r\nwas a paying crop and more easily grown than the grape may have had\r\nsomething to do with the failure to grow the latter. Or it may have been\r\nthat the cheapness of Madeira, \"a noble strong drink,\" as one of the\r\nColonial historians puts it, had a depressing influence on the industry.\r\nBut still more likely, the foreign plants did not thrive.\r\n\r\nEncouragement of the home production of wine did not cease in Virginia\r\nfor at least one hundred and fifty years; for in 1769 an enactment of\r\nthe Assembly was passed to encourage wine-making in favor of one Andrew\r\nEstave, a Frenchman. As a result of the act of this time, land was\r\npurchased, buildings erected, and slaves and workmen with a complete\r\noutfit for wine-making were furnished Estave. The act provided that if\r\nhe made within six years ten hogsheads of merchantable wine--land,\r\nhouses, slaves, the whole plant was to be given to him. It is stated\r\nthat this unusual subsidy is made \"as a reward for so useful an\r\nimprovement.\" Estave succeeded in making the wine but it was poor stuff\r\nand he had difficulty in getting the authorities to turn over the\r\nproperty which was to be his reward. This was finally done by an act of\r\nthe Assembly, however, the failure to make good wine being attributed by\r\nall parties to the \"unfitness of the land.\"\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made to cultivate the European grape in Virginia early in\r\nthe eighteenth century on an extensive scale. Soon after taking office\r\nas governor in 1710, Alexander Spotswood brought over a colony of\r\nGermans from the Rhine and settled them in Spottsylvania County on the\r\nRapidan river. The site of their village on this river is now marked by\r\na ford, Germania Ford, a name which is a record of the settlement. That\r\nthey grew grapes and made wine is certain, for the Governor's \"red and\r\nwhite Rapidan, made by his Spottsylvania Germans\" is several times\r\nmentioned in the published journals and letters of the time. But the\r\nventure did not make a deep nor lasting impress on the agriculture of\r\nthe colony.[11]\r\n\r\nSeveral early attempts were made in the Carolinas and Georgia to grow\r\nthe Vinifera grape. It was thought, in particular, that the French\r\nHuguenots who settled in these states in large numbers toward the close\r\nof the seventeenth century would succeed in grape-growing but even these\r\nskilled vine-growers failed. Their failures are recorded by Alexander\r\nHewitt in 1779 as follows: \"European grapes have been transplanted, and\r\nseveral attempts made to raise wine; but so overshaded are the vines\r\nplanted in the woods, and so foggy is the season of the year when they\r\nripen, that they seldom come to maturity, but as excellent grapes have\r\nbeen raised in gardens where they are exposed to the sun, we are apt to\r\nbelieve that proper methods have not been taken for encouraging that\r\nbranch of agriculture, considering its great importance in a national\r\nview.\" In Georgia, Abraham De Lyon, encouraged by the authorities of the\r\ncolony, imported vines from Portugal and planted them at Savannah early\r\nin the eighteenth century but his attempt, though carried out on a small\r\nscale in a garden, soon failed.\r\n\r\nIn Maryland, if the records are correct, a greater degree of success was\r\nattained than in the states to the south. Lord Charles Baltimore, son of\r\nthe grantee of the territory, in 1662 planted three hundred acres of\r\nland in St. Mary's to vines. It is certain that he made and sold wine in\r\nconsiderable quantities and the old chroniclers report that it was as\r\ngood as the best Burgundy. Efforts to grow the European grape in\r\nMaryland continued until as late as 1828 when the _Maryland Society for\r\nPromoting the Culture of the Vine_ was incorporated by the State\r\nLegislature.[12] The object of the Society was to \"carry on experiments\r\nin the cultivation of both the European and native grapes and to collect\r\nand disseminate all possible information upon this interesting\r\nsubject.\" The organization was in existence for several years and\r\nthrough its exertions practically all of the native sorts were tried in\r\nor about Baltimore as well as many seedlings. Besides the achievements\r\nof the Society as a body, their Secretary reports in 1831 that, through\r\nthe individual efforts of its members, there were then under cultivation\r\nnear the city of Baltimore several vineyards of from three to ten acres\r\neach and a great number of smaller ones. This was several years after\r\nthe introduction of the Catawba and Isabella for which grape-growers in\r\nother parts of the United States had largely given up the Vinifera\r\nsorts. Seemingly in every part of the Union the grape of the Old World\r\nwas tried, not once only, but time and again before its culture could be\r\ngiven up.\r\n\r\nThe Swedes made some attempts at an early day to grow grapes on the\r\nDelaware. Queen Christina instructed John Printz, governor of New\r\nSweden, to encourage the \"culture of the vine\" and to give the industry\r\nhis personal attention. Later when New Sweden had become a part of\r\nPennsylvania, William Penn encouraged vine-growing by importing cuttings\r\nof French and Spanish vines; and several experimental vineyards were set\r\nout in the neighborhood of Philadelphia, but all efforts to establish\r\nbearing plantations came to naught. Penn's interest in grape-growing\r\nseems to have been greatly stimulated by wine made by a friend of his\r\nfrom native grapes which grew about Germantown.\r\n\r\nThere are no detailed accounts of grape-growing by the Dutch of New York\r\nbut the following taken from the writings of Jasper Dankers and Peter\r\nSluyter, two Hollanders who visited New York in 1679, soon after the\r\nEnglish took possession of New Netherland, indicates that there had been\r\nattempts to cultivate grapes.[13] \"I went along the shore to Coney\r\nIsland, which is separated from Long Island only by a creek, and around\r\nthe point, and came inside not far from a village called _Gravesant_,\r\nand again home. We discovered on the roads several kinds of grapes still\r\non the vines, called _speck_ (pork) grapes, which are not always good,\r\nand these were not; although they were sweet in the mouth at first, they\r\nmade it disagreeable and stinking. The small blue grapes are better, and\r\ntheir vines grow in good form. Although they have several times\r\nattempted to plant vineyards, and have not immediately succeeded, they,\r\nnevertheless, have not abandoned the hope of doing so by and by, for\r\nthere is always some encouragement, although they have not, as yet,\r\ndiscovered the cause of the failure.\" The \"_speck_\" grape was without\r\nquestion _Vitis labrusca_ and the small blue grape was probably _Vitis\r\nriparia_.\r\n\r\nThirty years before the visit of Dankers and Sluyter the people of New\r\nNetherland addressed a remonstrance to the home government regarding\r\ncertain abuses in the colony. This document[14] is headed with a chapter\r\non the productions of New Netherland in which the wild grapes are\r\nmentioned and their cultivation is suggested. \"Almost the whole country,\r\nas well the forest as the maize lands and flats, is full of vines, but\r\nprincipally--as if they had been planted there--around and along the\r\nbanks of the brooks, streams and rivers which course and flow in\r\nabundance very conveniently and agreeably all through the land. The\r\ngrapes are of many varieties; some white, some blue, some very fleshy\r\nand fit only to make raisins of; some again are juicy, some very large,\r\nothers on the contrary small; their juice is pleasant and some of it\r\nwhite, like French or Rhenish Wine; that of others, again, a very deep\r\nred, like Tent; some even paler; the vines run far up the trees and are\r\nshaded by their leaves, so that the grapes are slow in ripening and a\r\nlittle sour, but were cultivation and knowledge applied here, doubtless\r\nas fine Wines would then be made as in any other wine growing\r\ncountries.\"\r\n\r\nNicolls, the first English governor of New York, greatly desired to grow\r\nthe vine for wine-making. In 1664 he granted Paul Richards a monopoly of\r\nthe industry for the colony stipulating that he could make and sell\r\nwines free of impost and gave him the right to tax any person planting\r\nvines in the colony five shillings per acre.[15] Richards lived in the\r\ncity of New York but his vineyard, as indicated in the grant, was\r\nlocated on Long Island. It may be assumed that this was the first\r\nattempt to grow grapes commercially in the State of New York. It would\r\nseem that the governor by granting a monopoly of the grape and wine\r\nindustry took the surest means of killing the infant industry. The Earl\r\nof Bellomont, a later governor of the Colony, wrote to London with\r\nassurances of a great future of viticulture in the Colony.[16] For over\r\na century after, there were spasmodic efforts to grow the Old World\r\ngrape in and about New York City, and at the beginning of the\r\nRevolutionary War there were a few small vineyards and some wine-making\r\non Manhattan Island.\r\n\r\nThere were many attempts to grow foreign grapes in New England. John\r\nWinthrop, governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony, had planted a vineyard\r\nin one of the islands, known as \"Governor's Garden,\" in Boston Harbor\r\nbefore 1630. Vine-planters were sent to this colony in 1629.[17] There\r\nwere plantations at the mouth of the Piscataqua in Maine as early or\r\nbefore Winthrop's plantings were made. In granting a charter to Rhode\r\nIsland in 1663, Charles II sought to encourage viticulture in that State\r\nby offering liberal inducements to colonists who would grow grapes and\r\nmake wine.[18] But if grapes were grown, or wine made from the foreign\r\ngrape, no great degree of success was attained. Wine was made in plenty\r\nfrom the wild grapes in all of the New England colonies so that it was\r\nnot because of Puritanical prejudices against wine that the grapes were\r\nnot grown. The glowing terms in which travelers returning to England\r\nspoke of the native grapes and of the wine from them undoubtedly\r\nstimulated those founding the colonies to make every effort to introduce\r\nthe cultivated grape even though the cold, bleak climate and thin soils\r\nof this northern region were inhospitable to a plant which thrives best\r\nin the sunny southern portions of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn only one of the states east of the Rockies is grape-growing recorded\r\nto have gained even a foothold before the introduction of varieties of\r\nnative grapes. In this instance there is much doubt as to whether the\r\nvarieties grown were pure-bred _Vitis vinifera_. Louisiana, while owned\r\nby France, grew grapes and made wine in such quantities, and the wine\r\nwas of such high quality, so several of the old chroniclers say, that\r\nthe French government forbade grape-growing in the colony. Since the\r\nwine-making was in the hands of the Jesuits who had learned the art in\r\nEurope, and since there were no cultivated varieties of native grapes at\r\nthat time of which there is record, the presumption among the early\r\nwriters was that these vineyards were of European grapes. Louisiana,\r\nhowever, was a vast and undefined region and it is not known where these\r\noft-mentioned vineyards were located. It is probable in the light of\r\nwhat we now know that these Louisiana Jesuits made wine from native\r\ngrapes either wild or cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe time covered so far is the two hundred years in which America was\r\nbeing colonized. We have seen that all of our European forefathers\r\nbrought with them a love of the vine, or more correctly, a love of wine,\r\nand that throughout the period many experiments were made in all parts\r\nof the eastern United States to grow varieties of _Vitis vinifera_. The\r\nexperiments were on a large scale and in the hands of expert\r\nvine-growers, as well trained as their fellow colonists in South Africa,\r\nNew Zealand, Australia and South America, countries where the colonists\r\ngrew the Old World grapes as easily and as well as they are grown in the\r\nmost favored parts of Europe. It is certain that the failures recorded\r\nfor these two hundred years were not due to lack of effort on the part\r\nof the settlers. We now pass to more recent efforts, even more\r\nthoroughly carried out, to grow the grape of the Old World in this part\r\nof the New World. The discussion of these later attempts cannot be full.\r\nThe reader can readily turn to the horticultural literature of the\r\ncentury just closed and find much fuller records of them than space\r\npermits in this work.\r\n\r\nOne of the first and most notable of the vineyards in the eighteenth\r\ncentury was that of Colonel Robert Bolling of Buckingham County,\r\nVirginia. An account of his undertaking written by one of the Bolling\r\nfamily some years later reads as follows: \"It is now but little known\r\nthat this gentleman had early turned his attention to the cultivation of\r\nthe vine, and had actually succeeded in procuring and planting a small\r\nvineyard of four acres, of European grapes, at Chellow, the seat of his\r\nresidence: that he had so far accomplished his object as to have the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing his vines in a most flourishing condition, and\r\narrived at an age when they were just beginning to bear; promising all\r\nthe success that the most sanguine imagination could desire, when,\r\nunfortunately for his family, and perhaps for his country, he departed\r\nthis life while in the Convention in Richmond, in July, 1775. Thus all\r\nhis fond anticipations of being enabled, in a short time, to afford to\r\nhis countrymen a practical demonstration of the facility and certainty\r\nwith which grapes might be raised, and wine made, in Virginia, were\r\nsuddenly frustrated; all his hopes and prospects blasted; and owing to\r\nthe general want of information, in the management of vines, among us at\r\nthat time; and the confusion produced by the war of the revolution,\r\nwhich immediately followed, this promising and flourishing little\r\nvineyard was totally neglected and finally perished.\"[19]\r\n\r\nAt the time of Bolling's death he was preparing to send to press a book\r\non grape-growing entitled _A Sketch of Vine Culture_. The book was never\r\nprinted but the manuscript was copied several times and parts of it were\r\nprinted contemporaneously in the _Virginia Gazette_, and subsequently in\r\nthe _Bolling Memoirs_ and in the _American Farmer_.[20] Bolling's book\r\nwas largely a compilation from European sources but it contained the\r\nexperiences and observations of the author in cultivating European\r\ngrapes in America and though not printed, was sufficiently distributed\r\nthrough manuscript copies and through the papers and books mentioned\r\nabove, to give its author the honor of being the first American writer\r\non grapes.\r\n\r\nIn an essay on the cultivation of the vine published in the first volume\r\nof the _Transactions of the American Philosophical Society_[21] printed\r\nin Philadelphia in 1771, a Mr. Edward Antill of Shrewsbury, New Jersey,\r\ngives explicit directions for grape-growing and wine-making.[22] Antill\r\ndescribes only foreign varieties and leads the reader to infer, though\r\nhe does not say so, that he has grown many varieties of these grapes\r\nsuccessfully. But neither his essay, nor his efforts at grape-growing,\r\nseemed to have stimulated a grape industry worthy of note. This essay of\r\nAntill's is the second American treatise on the cultivation of the grape\r\nand was for many years the chief authority on grape-growing in America.\r\nIt is greatly to be regretted that a treatise which was to be quoted for\r\nfifty years could not have been more meritorious. The eighty quarto\r\npages written by Antill give little real or trustworthy information. It\r\nis a rambling discussion of European grapes, wine-making, the temperance\r\nquestion, patriotism, \"wellfare of country,\" and \"good of mankind\". He\r\nquotes Columella, gives methods of curing grapes for raisins, and winds\r\nup with a discussion of figs. Yet a hundred years ago it was the chief\r\nwork on grape-growing.\r\n\r\nA Frenchman, Peter Legaux, founded a company in 1793 for the cultivation\r\nof grapes at Spring Mill near Philadelphia. In 1800 he published an\r\naccount of his venture.[23] A vineyard of European grapes was set out\r\nand the prospects seemed favorable for the success of the undertaking.\r\nBut the grapes began to fail, dissensions arose among the stock-holders,\r\nthe vineyards were neglected and the company failed. Legaux speaks of\r\nhis experience in grape-growing as follows:[24] \"But if the native\r\ngrapes of America are not the most eligible for vineyards, others are\r\nnow within the reach of its inhabitants. Some years since I procured\r\nfrom France three hundred plants from the three kinds of grapes in the\r\nhighest estimation, of which are made Burgundy, Champagne and Bordeaux\r\nwines. These three hundred plants have in ten years produced 100,000\r\nplants; which, were the culture encouraged, would in ten years more,\r\nproduce upwards of thirty millions of plants; or enough to stock more\r\nthan 8000 acres, at 3600 plants to the acre, set about three feet and a\r\nhalf apart. I have also about 3000 plants raised from a single plant\r\nprocured a few years since from the Cape of Good Hope, of the kind which\r\nproduces the excellent Constantia wines. The gentlemen who at different\r\ntimes have done me the honour to taste these wines can bear testimony to\r\ntheir good quality. Although made in the hottest season, (about the\r\nmiddle of August) yet they were perfectly preserved without the addition\r\nof a drop of brandy or any other spirit. And in this will consist one\r\nexcellency of the wines here recommended to the notice of my fellow\r\ncitizens; that being made wholly of the juice of grapes, they will be\r\nlight, wholesome, and excite an agreeable cheerfulness, without\r\ninflaming the blood, or producing the other ill effects of the strong\r\nbrandied wines, imported from the southern parts of Europe. Since 1793,\r\nI have confined my attention chiefly to the multiplication of my vines,\r\nto supply the demand for plants, and to furnish an extended vineyard\r\nunder my own direction, whenever my fellow citizens possessing pecuniary\r\nmeans, should be inclined to encourage and support the attempt.\"\r\n\r\nOut of this venture, however, came the Alexander grape, an offspring of\r\na native species, and not, as Legaux held, a foreign variety, which, as\r\nwe shall see later, was the first variety to be grown on a commercial\r\nscale in eastern America. Johnson,[25] writing of Legaux's work with the\r\ngrape, says that in 1801 cuttings were sent from the Spring Mill\r\nvineyards in quantities of fifteen hundred to Kentucky and Pennsylvania\r\nand smaller quantities to Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland,\r\nVirginia and Ohio, and indicates that these cuttings in their turn were\r\nmultiplied so that many diverse experiments with foreign grapes arose\r\nfrom Legaux's efforts.\r\n\r\nChief of the experiments which Legaux's partial success in vine-growing\r\nstimulated was carried on in Kentucky by _The Kentucky Vineyard Society_\r\nof which John James Dufour, a Swiss, was leader.[26] It was to this\r\nCompany that Legaux had sent the fifteen hundred cuttings mentioned\r\nabove as going to Kentucky. Before founding his grape colony, Dufour had\r\nmade a tour of inspection of all the vineyards that he could hear of in\r\nwhat then constituted the United States. His account of what he saw,\r\ngiven in his book _The Vine Dresser's Guide_, is the most accurate\r\nstatement we have of grape-growing in America at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nDufour's account, pages 18-24, runs as follows: \"I went to see all the\r\nvines growing that I could hear of, even as far as Kaskaskia, on the\r\nborders of the Mississippi; because I was told, by an inhabitant of that\r\ntown, whom I met with at Philadelphia, that the Jesuits had there a very\r\nsuccessful vineyard, when that country belonged to the French, and were\r\nafterwards ordered by the French government to destroy it, for fear the\r\nculture of the grapes should spread in America and hurt the wine trade\r\nof France. As I had seen but discouraging plantations of vines on that\r\nside of the Alleghany, and as the object of my journey to America, was\r\npurposely to learn what could be done in that line of business; I was\r\ndesirous to see if the west would afford more encouragement. I resolved\r\ntherefore on a visit to see if any remains of the Jesuits' vines were\r\nstill in being, and what sort of grapes they were; supposing very\r\nnaturally, that if they had succeeded as well as tradition reported,\r\nsome of them might possibly be found in some of the gardens there. But I\r\nfound only the spot where that vineyard had been planted, in a well\r\nselected place, on the side of a hill to the north east of the town,\r\nunder a cliff. No good grapes, however were found either there, or in\r\nany of the gardens of the country. * * * In my journeying down the Ohio,\r\nI found at Marietta a Frenchman, who was making several barrels of wine\r\nevery year, out of grapes that were growing wild, and abundantly, on the\r\nheads of the Islands of the Ohio River, known by the name of Sand\r\ngrapes, because they grow best on the gravels; a few plants of which are\r\nnow growing in one of our vineyards, given by the Harmonites under the\r\nname of red juice. * * * The various attempts at vineyards that I heard\r\nof, which I went to see, at Monticello, President Jefferson's place;\r\nwhich, in 1799, I perceived had been abandoned, or left without any care\r\nfor three or four years before, which proved evidently, that it had not\r\nbeen profitable: At Spring Mill, on the Schuylkill, near Philadelphia,\r\nplanted by Mr. LEGAUX, a French gentleman, and afterwards supported by a\r\nwealthy Society formed by subscription, at that City, for the express\r\npurpose of trying to extend the culture of the grape. I saw that\r\nvineyard in 1796, 1799 and 1806. On the estate of Mr. CAROLL, of\r\nCarollton, below Baltimore, in Maryland; whither I went on purpose from\r\nPhiladelphia in 1796, there was a small vineyard kept by a French\r\nvinedresser, and where they had tried a few sorts of the indigenous\r\ngrapes. At the Southern Liberties of Philadelphia, I saw in 1806, a\r\nplantation of a large assortment of the best species of French grapes;\r\nwhich a French vinedresser had brought over the Atlantic. They were at\r\ntheir 2d or 3d years: they had not been attacked by the sickness: their\r\nnurse was yet full of hope.--In 1796, I saw also, near the Susquehannah\r\nriver, not far from Middletown, a vineyard that had been planted by a\r\nGerman; but who having died sometime before, the vineyard had been\r\nwholly neglected. I was told, it had produced some wine; but it had\r\nsuffered so much delapidation, that I could not recognize the species of\r\ngrapes.\"\r\n\r\nWith full knowledge of the failures of the past in growing grapes, and\r\nafter his disheartening visits to a score or more of worthless vineyards\r\nplanted with the grapes of his native country, Dufour embarked in the\r\n_Kentucky Vineyard Society_ enterprise and gave the Old World grapes a\r\nthorough trial on an extensive scale, with an abundance of capital, and,\r\nto care for the vines, as skilled labor as could be obtained in the\r\nvineyards of Europe. As was the case with all past undertakings of the\r\nkind so this one proved a failure. In the words of Dufour \"a sickness\r\ntook hold of all our vines except a few stocks of Cape and Madeira\r\ngrapes.\" The promoters became disheartened and the vineyard after being\r\ncultivated for several years was abandoned.\r\n\r\nMembers of the colony, thinking that a more favorable location might be\r\nfound elsewhere in the valley of the Ohio, settled at Vevay, Indiana, in\r\n1802. Dufour and several of his relatives were granted the privilege of\r\npurchasing lands with extended credit by an act of Congress May 1st,\r\n1802. They purchased 2500 acres at the location of the new colony in\r\nIndiana and began anew the culture of the vine. For a time there was an\r\nelement of prosperity in the enterprise but the vines became diseased\r\nand died, only one sort, the Cape or Alexander, gave returns for the\r\ncare bestowed and by 1835 the Vevay vineyards ceased to exist. Could\r\nDufour have foreseen the value of the native grapes for cultivation and\r\ndevoted the capital and energy spent on European sorts to the best wild\r\nplants from the woods, grape culture in America would have been put\r\nforward half a century.\r\n\r\nOther experiments with Old World grapes were tried in 1803 by the\r\nHarmonists, a religious-socialistic community founded in Germany, but\r\nwhich finally settled in America. After temporary sojourns in other\r\nsettlements, the Harmonists founded a permanent colony in Pennsylvania\r\nnear Pittsburg. Here they planted ten acres of European grapes and grew\r\nthem with but temporary success, if any, for Dufour in 1826 visited the\r\ncolony and says: \"None of the imported grapes do well there except the\r\nBlack Juice, of which I saw but one plant; it is too small a bearer to\r\nbe worth nursing.\"[27] Again there was disaster to an extensive\r\nexperiment in the hands of skilled men. Besides having tried grape\r\nculture in Pennsylvania, the Harmonists made plantations at New Harmony,\r\nIndiana, where they settled for a time; but exact accounts of this\r\nexperiment are wanting.\r\n\r\nOne other of the many organized attempts to grow the foreign grapes\r\nneeds mention. When the Napoleonic wars were over a number of\r\nBonaparte's exiled officers came to America. They were impoverished, and\r\nin order to help them, as well as to insure their becoming permanent\r\nsettlers in the United States, the exiles were organized by American\r\nsympathizers into a society for the cultivation of the vine and the\r\nolive. The society was organized in the early fall of 1816 in\r\nPhiladelphia and the remainder of the year was spent in prospecting for\r\na suitable location for the venture. The colony finally decided to\r\nsettle on the Tombigbee river in Alabama and petitioned Congress for a\r\ngrant of land in that region. In the end the refugees obtained a grant\r\nfrom Congress of four contiguous townships, each six miles square[28]\r\nfor the culture of the vine and the olive.\r\n\r\nIn 1817, an installment of one hundred and fifty French settlers left\r\nPhiladelphia taking with them an assortment of grape and olive plants.\r\nDecember 12, 1821, Charles Villars, one of the company, reported to the\r\nAmerican government[29] that there were then in the colony eighty-one\r\nactual planters, 327 persons all told, with 1100 acres in full\r\ncultivation, including 10,000 vines and that the company had spent about\r\n$160,000 in the venture. Villars tells in full of the ups and downs of\r\nthe Society. It was apparent from the start that the olive could not be\r\ngrown. The history of the vineyards on the Tombigbee, as he tells it, is\r\nbut a record of misfortune. All efforts to cultivate the foreign vines\r\nresulted only in failure. The few vines that the vintners made grow\r\nyielded a scant crop of miserable quality which could not be made into\r\nwine because of ripening in the heat of summer. The land was not adapted\r\nto growing grapes. The Society, meeting failure at every turn, finally\r\ndisbanded and the colonists were scattered. For a half century after,\r\nthere were records in the southern agricultural literature of the\r\nattempts of stragglers or descendants of this colony to grow European\r\ngrapes in the South. Yet these grapes are not now cultivated in this\r\nregion, which seemingly has the climate and the soil of France.\r\n\r\nThe history of these French settlers on the Tombigbee is a most pathetic\r\none.[30] Many of the leaders had been officers of high rank in\r\nNapoleon's armies unaccustomed to field work and the hardships of a new\r\ncountry. Here, in a rough and hardly explored country, part of which was\r\noverflowed half of the year, visited by all the sicknesses inherent to\r\nsuch a location, they passed several years in their attempts to grow\r\nEuropean grapes. Failure was predestined because of natural obstacles\r\nwhich by this time were apparent, and was foreshadowed by so many\r\nprevious unsuccessful attempts that it would seem that this culminating\r\ntragedy in growing European grapes could have been prevented. The\r\ncertain failure of the attempt makes all the more pathetic the story of\r\nthe Vine and Olive Colony on the Tombigbee.[31]\r\n\r\nIn closing the record of the Old World grape in America a few of the\r\nlater individual attempts to grow this grape must be recounted.\r\n\r\nThree generations of Princes experimented with European grapes at the\r\nfamous Linnæan Botanic Garden, Flushing, Long Island. Wm. R. Prince[32]\r\nauthor of _A Treatise on the Vine_, devoted his life to promoting the\r\nculture of the grape in America. He tried all of the European sorts\r\nobtainable, \"reared\" as he tells us, \"from plants imported _direct_ from\r\nthe most celebrated collections in France, Germany, Italy, the Crimea,\r\nMadeira, etc.; and above two hundred varieties are the identical kinds\r\nwhich were cultivated at the Royal Garden of the Luxembourg at Paris, an\r\nestablishment formed by royal patronage for the purpose of concentrating\r\nall the most valuable fruits of France, and testing their respective\r\nmerits.\"[33] After nearly a half century of experimentation he gave up\r\nthe culture of foreign grapes and largely devoted the last years of his\r\nlife to growing and disseminating native varieties, exercising,\r\nprobably, a greater influence on the culture of American grapes than any\r\nother of the many men who have helped improve the grapes of this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nNicholas Longworth,[34] of Cincinnati, Ohio, experimented with the\r\nEuropean grapes for thirty years. His experience is best told in his own\r\nwords written in 1846: \"I have tried the foreign grapes extensively for\r\nwine at great expense for many years, and have abandoned them as unfit\r\nfor our climate. In the acclimation of plants I do not believe. The\r\nwhite, Sweetwater grape is not more hardy with me than it was thirty\r\nyears since, and does not bear as well. I have tried them in all soils\r\nand with all exposures.\r\n\r\n\"I obtained 5,000 plants from Madeira, 10,000 from France; and one-half\r\nof them, consisting of twenty varieties of the most celebrated wine\r\ngrapes from the mountains of Jura, in the extreme northern[35] part of\r\nFrance, where the vine region ends; I also obtained them from the\r\nvicinity of Paris, Bordeaux, and from Germany. I went to the expense of\r\ntrenching one hundred feet square on a side hill, placing a layer of\r\nstone and gravel at the bottom, with a drain to carry off the water, and\r\nto put in a compost of rich soil and sand three feet deep, and planted\r\non it a great variety of foreign wine grapes. All failed; and not a\r\nsingle plant is left in my vineyards. I would advise the cultivation of\r\nnative grapes alone, and the raising of new varieties from their\r\nseed.\"[36]\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution drove a wealthy and educated Frenchman, M.\r\nParmentier, to New York at the beginning of the nineteenth century. He\r\nplanted about his place in Brooklyn a large garden in which there were\r\nmany grapes. This garden afterward became a commercial nursery from\r\nwhich was distributed a considerable number of European grapes. Mr.\r\nRobert Underhill at Croton Point on the Hudson was induced to plant a\r\nvineyard of these but they soon went the way of all their kind, leaving\r\nMr. Underhill only a consuming desire to plant grapes. This desire bore\r\nfruit, as we shall see. When the reign of terror had ceased, Parmentier\r\nreturned to France from whence he sent many grapes to friends in\r\nAmerica. He left a lasting impress on the horticulture and viticulture\r\nof America, through his experimental efforts with plants and his\r\ncontribution to American horticultural literature. The Underhills (the\r\nfather had been joined by his sons R. T. and W. A. Underhill) planted a\r\nvineyard of Catawbas and Isabellas in 1827. These vineyards grew until\r\nthey covered seventy-five acres, the product of which was marketed in\r\nthe metropolis and nearby cities. The grapes from this vineyard often\r\nsold for twenty-five cents a pound and supplied the whole market of the\r\nregion. The grape industry of the Hudson River Valley began with\r\nParmentier and the Underhills.\r\n\r\nAnother Frenchman, Alphonse Loubat, planted a vineyard of forty acres at\r\nUtrecht, Long Island, containing about 150,000 plants of foreign\r\nvarieties. Here, we are told, \"he strove against mildew and sun-scald\r\nfor several years, but had to yield at last, as the elements were too\r\nmuch for human exertions to overcome.\"[37] Loubat attempted to protect\r\nhis grapes from mildew by covering them with paper bags and was probably\r\nthe originator of the practice of bagging grapes.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently one may still find some varieties of the Old World\r\ngrape grown out of doors with a fair degree of success in favored\r\nlocations but always by the amateur and never in a commercial vineyard.\r\nThese few pages rehearsing repeated failures without a single success,\r\nserve to show the uselessness of attempting to grow foreign grapes in\r\neastern America. Their culture has been tried by thousands on a small\r\nscale and by many individuals with experience, knowledge and capital on\r\na large scale. With all, the results have been the same; a year or two\r\nof promise, then disease, dead vines and an abandoned vineyard.\r\n\r\nThe causes for these failures have been indicated. As Dufour says, \"a\r\nsickness takes hold of the vines.\" Phylloxera, mildew, rot--native\r\nparasites to which native grapes are comparatively immune--\"take hold\"\r\nof the foreign sorts and they die.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, too, that our climate, at the North at least, is not\r\nwell suited to the production of the Old World grape. As a species, the\r\nVinifera grapes thrive best in climates equable in both temperature and\r\nhumidity. The climate of eastern America is not equable; it alternates\r\nbetween hot and cold, wet and dry. The range in both temperature and\r\nhumidity is far greater than in the grape-growing regions of Europe,\r\nCalifornia, South Africa or Australia. The fleshy roots of _Vitis\r\nvinifera_ are more tender to cold than are those of the species of\r\nnorthern United States and this would prevent its culture becoming very\r\ngeneral in many regions where native grapes can be grown.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the regions west of the Rocky Mountains, and more\r\nparticularly in California, that the varieties of Vinifera are\r\nsuccessfully grown in America. The great viticultural interests of the\r\nfar West are founded upon the success of this one species. The native\r\ngrapes can be grown but they cannot compete in California with _Vitis\r\nvinifera_ for any purpose. Nevertheless American species are\r\nindispensable in this western region for stocks upon which to graft the\r\nVinifera varieties, and it is probable that the time is not far distant\r\nwhen all California vines will be upon American roots. Within the\r\nboundaries of latitude in which Vinifera varieties are grown west of the\r\nRocky Mountains the grape shows wonderful adaptability; it is found at\r\nall elevations permitting fruit culture; it grows on practically all\r\nsoils; it thrives under irrigation or under dry farming; it is given\r\nvarious kinds of treatment, including total neglect, and still thrives;\r\nthe number of varieties grown for wine, raisin and table grapes runs\r\ninto hundreds. The truly wonderful success met with in the cultivation\r\nof this species west of the great continental divide makes all the more\r\nremarkable the fact that in no place east of the divide will varieties\r\nof it thrive.\r\n\r\nWe now pass to a consideration of the American grapes, their characters,\r\nthe early notices of them, their rise, their success, and their\r\nfuture--a more pleasing task than to record disaster after disaster in\r\ngrowing the grape of the Old World.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAMERICAN GRAPES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grape is preeminently a North American plant. The genus Vitis is a\r\nlarge one, from thirty to fifty species being distinguished for the\r\nworld; more than half of these are found on this continent. But few\r\nother plants in America, or in the world, inhabit such varied and such\r\nextended areas. In North America wild grapes abound on the warm, dry\r\nsoils of New Brunswick and New England, about the Great Lakes in Canada\r\nand in the United States, and on the fertile river banks and in the\r\nvalleys, rich woodlands and thickets of the eastern and southern States.\r\nThey thrive in the dry woods, sandy sea-plains, and reef-keys of the\r\nCarolinas, Georgia and Florida where the vines of the Scuppernong often\r\nrun more than a hundred feet over trees and shrubs, rioting in natural\r\nluxuriance. They flourish in the mountains and limestone hills of the\r\nVirginias, Tennessee and Kentucky. They are not so common in the West,\r\nyet found in almost all parts of Missouri and Arkansas, and from North\r\nDakota through Kansas to southern Texas. Some wild grape is found in\r\neach of the Rocky Mountain States on plain or mountain, or in river\r\nchasm or dry canon. Several species are found in New Mexico, Arizona and\r\nCalifornia, where if they did not furnish the Spanish _padres_ of Santa\r\nFe and San Diego with fruit for wine, they suggested to them the\r\nplanting of the first successful vineyards in the United States.\r\n\r\nHow did the grape spread from the Carolinas to California and from\r\nsubtropical Mexico to the barren plains of Central Canada? Why divide\r\ninto its manifold forms in the distribution? These questions are of\r\npractical import to the grape-grower and breeder who seeks to improve\r\nthis fruit. The knowledge of the distribution and evolution of plants\r\nobtained in the last half century is so complete that these questions\r\npresent few difficulties to the naturalist of today. In answering them\r\nno one would now hold that the numerous species and their sub-divisions\r\nwere created separately for the regions in which they grow. All would\r\ntake the ground that the different wild forms come from one ancestral\r\nspecies. We can waive the question as to what the original species was\r\nand as to where it first grew.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that grapes have not been distributed over North America\r\nby the hand of man. Probably they have been growing in the regions where\r\nthey are now found since before the migration of the first savages. The\r\nagents of distribution have been natural ones, such as animals, birds,\r\nand lake and river currents. These have widened the area of a species to\r\nlimits imposed by the hostile action of other plants and of animals and\r\nby geographical and physical conditions. As a species has encroached\r\nupon a new region, climate, soil, all of the conditions of environment,\r\nand the contest with other living things, have gradually modified its\r\ncharacters until in time it became so changed that it constituted a new\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThis descent from an original species with plants changed by environment\r\nhas given us, in America, types of the wild grape as widely diverse as\r\nthe regions they inhabit. The species found in the forests have\r\ndeveloped long slender trunks and branches in their struggle to attain\r\nsunlight and air. At least two species are dwarf and shrubby, or\r\ninfrequently climbing, two to six feet high, growing in dry sands, on\r\nrocky hills and mountains where roots must cling to rocks and penetrate\r\ninto interstices. Still another form runs on the ground and over low\r\nbushes and is nearly evergreen, but in the herbarium can hardly be\r\ndistinguished from a grape whose habit of growth is strikingly\r\ndifferent. Some are long-lived, growing and bearing fruit for two or\r\nmore centuries, while others reach no greater age than the ordinary\r\nshrub. Some have enormous stems, a foot or more in diameter, gnarled and\r\npicturesque and supporting a great canopy of branch and foliage,[38]\r\nwhile others are slender in stem and graceful, almost delicate, in\r\ncharacter of vine. Not less remarkable than the differences in structure\r\nis the adaptability of the genus and some of the species to varied\r\nclimatic conditions. Several of the wild grapes develop full size and\r\ndisplay natural luxuriance and fruit-bearing qualities only in the\r\nMiddle States, but may be found on dry, gravelly, wind-swept hills far\r\nto the north or in some hot and humid atmosphere of the South, as if to\r\nshow indifference to wet or dry, heat or cold.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there are many strong points of resemblance between\r\nthe score or more of species. The organs and characters that do not bear\r\nthe strain of changed environment, nor suffer in the perpetual warfare\r\nof nature, are much the same in all of the species of Vitis. Thus the\r\nstructure of flowers, fruits and seeds is practically identical; all\r\nhave naked-tipped tendrils; leaves and leaf-buds are very similar; and\r\nthe various species usually hybridize freely. They are alike in the\r\nunlikeness of individual plants in any of the species; that is, all of\r\nthe individuals of the genus are most variable and seeds taken from the\r\nsame vine may produce plants quite unlike one another and quite unlike\r\nthe parent.\r\n\r\nThese few facts regarding the evolution and distribution of American\r\ngrapes lead to two important conclusions:\r\n\r\nFirst, the species are so distributed throughout the United States, and\r\nindividuals of the species grow in such abundance and luxuriance, as to\r\nsuggest that we shall be able to improve and domesticate some one or\r\nmore of them for all of the agricultural regions of the country. For it\r\nis proved that nearly all of the wild grapes have horticultural\r\npossibilities; and experience with many plants teaches that the\r\nboundaries of areas inhabited by the wild species of a given region\r\ncoincide with those suited to the production of the domesticated plant\r\nin that region. It is not possible to tell where the grape-growing\r\nregions of the future are to be located; for species and individuals of\r\nthis fruit are so common that no one can say where the grape is most at\r\nhome in America.\r\n\r\nSecond, grapes are so variable and plastic in nature that, were it not\r\nknown from experience, it could be assumed that they would yield readily\r\nto improvement. Besides being variable they hybridize freely and thus\r\nthe plant-breeder can obtain desirable starting points. There are\r\nindications that some of the characters of grapes, at least, follow\r\nMendel's Law, and when once these have been determined, and the more\r\nimportant unit characters segregated and defined, it ought to be\r\npossible to combine and rearrange the characters of this fruit with some\r\nsystem and surely with more certainty than in the past.\r\n\r\nThis brief introduction leads us to the consideration of American grapes\r\nas cultivated plants. We have seen that it is an absolute impossibility\r\nto grow the Old World grape in eastern America. The fruit-growers in\r\nthis great region are forced to plant the native grapes if any. It\r\nrequired two hundred years to establish this fact and it is less than a\r\nhundred years since grape-growers have generally acknowledged it as a\r\nfact. What was known of American grapes during the two hundred years\r\nwasted in attempting to grow the foreign Vinifera? And what has been\r\naccomplished in a century in ameliorating the native grapes?\r\n\r\nThe earliest European visitors to the Atlantic seaboard delighted in the\r\nwild grapes which they found everywhere and which reminded them of the\r\nOld World vineyards. Had they never seen such a fruit, the wild grapes\r\ncould not long have escaped their attention; for the Indians knew and\r\nused them as they did potatoes, corn, and tobacco. In the narratives of\r\nthe early voyages the grape is often in the lists of the resources and\r\ntreasures of the new-found continent. Unfortunately it was not\r\nconsidered of great intrinsic value but only suggested to the explorers\r\nthat the grape of the old home might be grown in the new home. Could a\r\npart of the exaggerated esteem given by the early European travelers and\r\nhome-seekers to sassafras, ginseng and other such plants, have been\r\nbestowed upon the wild grapes which over-run the country, viticulture\r\nwould have taken rank with the tobacco, lumber and the fish industries\r\nof the early settlers.\r\n\r\nIn the history of Vinland, or more properly Wineland, we find the first\r\nrecord of American grapes.[39] Biarni Heriulfsson, a Norseman, while\r\nmaking a voyage from Iceland to Greenland, 986 A. D., was driven by a\r\nstorm to the coast of New England but did not touch land. Leif the\r\nLucky, son of Eric the Red, about 1000 A. D., visited the country\r\ndiscovered by Biarni. One of Leif's men, Tyrker, a German who \"was born\r\nwhere there is no lack of either grapes or vines,\" discovered grapes,\r\nwhereupon Leif named the country \"Wineland.\" Other Norsemen in at least\r\ntwo expeditions visited Wineland, supposed to be a part of Rhode Island\r\nor Massachusetts, and for centuries after, the land discovered by Leif\r\nthe Lucky was known in Icelandic literature as \"Wineland the Good.\" The\r\nfirst European to touch the New World christened it after its grapes.\r\n\r\nThe next record we have of American grapes comes from an Englishman, one\r\nCaptain John Hawkins, who visited the Spanish settlements in Florida in\r\n1565.[40] In his account of the colony he speaks of the wild grapes,\r\ncomparing them, as did all the early explorers, with those of Europe. He\r\nindicates further that the Spaniards had discovered the value of the\r\nwild grape for domestic purposes and says that they had made twenty\r\nhogsheads of wine in a single season. It is almost certain that this\r\ngrape was _Vitis rotundifolia_, best represented by the Scuppernong,\r\nwhich is commonly found on the Atlantic sea-coast from Maryland to\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\nThe first English colonists, like the Norsemen, declared the new-found\r\nworld to be a natural vineyard. Amadas and Barlowe, sent out by Raleigh\r\nin 1584, described the land[41] \"so full of grapes as the very beating\r\nand surge of the sea overflowed them, of which we found such plenty, as\r\nwell there as in all places else, both on the sand and on the green\r\nsoil, on the hills as on the plains, as well as on every little shrub\r\nas also climbing towards the top of high cedars, that I think in all the\r\nworld the like abundance is not to be found.\"\r\n\r\nRalph Lane, in a subsequent expedition of Raleigh's, in a letter to\r\nHakluyt, pronounced the grapes of Virginia to be larger than those of\r\nFrance, Spain or Italy.[42]\r\n\r\nThe region described by Amadas and Barlowe is that of the two great\r\nsounds, Albemarle and Pamlico, on the coast of North Carolina and more\r\nspecifically Roanoke Island. It was to this place that Raleigh sent his\r\nexpeditions, with one of which Amadas and Barlowe were connected, and\r\nestablished the earliest colony of Englishmen in the New World. The\r\nfirst home of Europeans in America was in Vinland, named for its grapes.\r\nThe first home of Englishmen was on Roanoke Island, \"so full of grapes\r\nthat the very sea overflowed them.\"\r\n\r\nA few years later, Thomas Hariot, in a description of Virginia which\r\nmust have done much to decide the English as to the advisability of\r\nestablishing colonies in America, gave a detailed account of the\r\nmerchantable commodities the new countries afforded. Among these he\r\nmentions grapes which he describes as being of two kinds that the soil\r\nyields naturally and abundantly, of which one was small and sour and of\r\nthe bigness of the European grape while the other was of greater size\r\nand more sweet and luscious. Hariot concludes his description with the\r\nstatement that \"when they are planted and husbanded as they ought, a\r\nprincipal commodity of wine may be raised.\"[43]\r\n\r\nOf the later accounts given of grapes in Virginia and the Carolinas by\r\nthe colonizers and adventurers of the seventeenth century there are so\r\nmany that it is impossible to present all and difficult to sort out\r\nthose most apt. A few more may be given:\r\n\r\nCaptain John Smith, soldier, colonizer and Virginian planter, writing in\r\n1606 describes two sorts of wild grapes. He says:[44] \"Of vines great\r\nabundance in many parts that climbe the toppes of highest trees in some\r\nplaces, but these beare but few grapes. Except by the rivers and savage\r\nhabitations, where they are not overshadowed from the sunne, they are\r\ncovered with fruit, though never pruined nor manured. Of those hedge\r\ngrapes we made neere twentie gallons of wine, which was like our French\r\nBrittish wine, but certainely they would prove good were they well\r\nmanured. There is another sort of grape neere as great as a Cherry, this\r\nthey [Indians] call _Messamins_, they be fatte, and the juyce thicke.\r\nNeither doth the taste so well please when they are made in wine.\"\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that the first English colonist in the New World\r\nnoticed that the vines in the vicinity of the Indian habitations and\r\nalong the edges of creeks, rivers and swamps, where not overshadowed\r\nfrom the sun, were covered with fruit. The statement of this fact,\r\ncoupled with the one following, \"but certainely they would prove good\r\nwere they well manured,\" indicates that the possibility of successful\r\ncultivation of the wild grapes was considered at this early time. In\r\nfact, as we have seen, Lord Delaware at once sought to test the virtues\r\nof the native grapes by bringing over a number of French vine-dressers,\r\nwho not only planted cuttings imported from Europe but proceeded at once\r\nto transplant the vine of the country.[45] A few years later, according\r\nto Bruce, Sir Thomas Dale \"established a vineyard at Henrico not long\r\nafter the foundation of that settlement, covering an area of three\r\nacres, in which he planted the vines of the native grape for the purpose\r\nof testing their adaptability to the production of wines that could be\r\nsubstituted for those of France and Spain.\"[46]\r\n\r\nFrancis Maguel, who visited Virginia in 1609, stated that the wine made\r\nin the colony reminded him of the Alicante which he had drunk in\r\nSpain.[47]\r\n\r\nThe first Secretary of the Colony, William Strachey, was somewhat\r\nfulsome in his praise of the new found fruit. Writing[48] in 1610, he\r\nsays that the vines burden every bush, climb to the top of the highest\r\ntrees and are always full of clusters of grapes though never pruned or\r\nmanured. He declares that the grapes are as good as those to be found\r\nbetween Paris and Amiens and that the wine made by the settlers from the\r\nwild grapes was equal to French or British wine, \"being strong and\r\nheaddy.\" In closing his description he states that by art and industry\r\nskillful vignerons could bring viticulture unto such perfection as will\r\nenable the colony to export wine to the mother country.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous writer in 1649, who sets out to give a \"full and true\r\nrelation of the present state of the plantations, their health, peace\r\nand plenty,\" etc., etc., thought that the colony needed only some one to\r\nset an example to the ordinary settlers to induce them to grow grapes.\r\nThis writer says: \"Vines in abundance and variety, do grow naturally\r\nover all the land, but by the birds and beasts, most devoured before\r\nthey come to perfection and ripenesse; but this testifies and declares,\r\nThat the Ground, and the Climate is most proper, and the Commodity of\r\nWine is not a contemptible Merchandize; but some men of worth and estate\r\nmust give in these things example to the inferior inhabitants and\r\nordinary sort of men, to shew them the gain and Commodity by it, which\r\nthey will not believe but by experience before their faces:\"[49]\r\n\r\nA hundred years later, according to Beverly, the grape was scarcely\r\ncultivated, the masses of the people being content with the fruit of the\r\nwild vines which grew everywhere in the forest. So far as is known there\r\nwere in Beverly's time, 1722, no named varieties and there had been no\r\nefforts to improve the wild grapes in any way. There are no indications\r\nfrom the early writings to show that the Virginian settlers even knew\r\nhow to propagate grapes. The reason for this neglect is largely to be\r\nsought for in the last sentence in the subjoined footnote from\r\nBeverly.[50] This neglect was in spite of the fact that from the first\r\nthe settlers had noted that when the vines were open to the sun the crop\r\nwas improved.\r\n\r\nIn the northern colonies, as in Virginia, about the first object to\r\nattract the attention of the early settlers was the wild grape. The\r\ngrape, possibly more than any other natural product of the soil, is\r\nmentioned in the preliminary surveys of the Atlantic Coast as offering\r\nreasonable ground for the expectation that American soils would furnish\r\nall of the supplies necessary for the sustenance and comfort of\r\nsettlers. A few statements from the early explorers and visitors in the\r\nMiddle and New England States will serve to show how plentiful wild\r\ngrapes were in these regions and the estimation in which they were held.\r\n\r\nIn Delaware, Beauchamp Plantagenet, describing a \"Uvedale under\r\nWebsneck,\" in his account of New Albion, says that it contains \"four\r\nsorts of excellent great vines running on mulberry and sassafras trees;\r\nthere are four sorts of grapes, the first is the Thoulouse Muscat, sweet\r\nscented, the second the great fox and thick grape, after five months\r\nreaped being boiled and salted, and well fined, it is a strong red\r\nXeres; the third a light Claret, the fourth a white grape creeps on the\r\nland, maketh a pure gold color white wine; Tenis Pale, the Frenchman, of\r\nthese four made eight sorts of excellent wine, and of the Muscat acute\r\nboiled that the second draught will fox[51] a reasonable pate four\r\nmonths old: and here may be gathered and made two hundred ton in the\r\nvintage month, and replanted will mend.\"\r\n\r\nIn New England the seventeenth century notices of the wild grape are\r\neven more numerous than similar records to the south but they are\r\nbriefer and the northern observer did not recognize the possibilities of\r\ntheir domestic use and of bringing them under cultivation. This seeming\r\nneglect of the Puritans was not because the northern wild grapes are\r\ninferior to those of Virginia and the Carolinas, but more likely because\r\nof the social and industrial conditions of the colonists. The richer\r\nplanters in the South had time for wine-making, the only purpose for\r\nwhich grapes were then grown, and for growing the grapes. The New\r\nEnglanders had to struggle for the necessities of life.\r\n\r\nIt is significant, too, that the Southerners were fond of wine, and\r\nimported Madeira in large quantities. In New England, rum seems to have\r\nbeen preferred to wine, and as its manufacture from molasses is very\r\nsimple and the latter was to be had from the West Indies at small cost,\r\nwine-making and grape-growing received small attention.\r\n\r\nYet nearly all of the writers on the resources of the New England\r\nColonies mentioned grapes. Thus Governor Edward Winslow writing in 1621\r\nof the country in which the Puritans had found a home says: \"here are\r\ngrapes, white and red, and very sweet and strong also.\" We have seen\r\nthat Winthrop was so impressed with the possibility of grape-growing in\r\nthe new colony that he secured a grant of Governor's Island in Boston\r\nHarbor upon which to plant a vineyard. In Thomas Morton's _New English\r\nCanaan_ is found the best account of the wild grapes of New England as\r\nthe Puritan found them. He says:[52] \"Vines, of this kinde of trees,\r\nthere are that beare grapes of three colours, that is to say: white,\r\nblack, and red.\r\n\r\n\"The Country is so apt for vines, that (but for the fire at the spring\r\nof the yeare) the vines would so over spreade the land, that one should\r\nnot be able to passe for them, the fruit is as bigg of some as a musket\r\nbullet, and is excellent in taste.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Josselyn in _New England's Rarities_, speaks of a grape having \"a\r\ntaste of gunpowder,\" a short but vivid description of _Vitis\r\nlabrusca_.[53] William Wood in _New England's Prospect_ gives still\r\nanother account of the grapes of New England.[54]\r\n\r\nThe references given are sufficient to show that the value of the native\r\ngrapes as a source of food and for wine was recognized by the first\r\nsettlers in practically all of the colonies and that their possibilities\r\nas cultivated plants were considered by some of the colonizers. Yet for\r\ntwo hundred years there were no zealous efforts made to cultivate\r\nAmerican grapes. Indeed, there are far fewer references to the wild\r\ngrapes of the country in the eighteenth century than in the seventeenth.\r\nThe reasons for this neglect of a plant which could so easily have been\r\nimproved by cultivation, and this must have been apparent, are several.\r\nDuring all of this period the European grape was being tried and all\r\nhopes for viticulture were centered about it. Again, fruit of any kind\r\nwas not a common article of diet with Americans until even so recently\r\nas a generation ago, and native grapes are dessert fruits, not wine\r\nfruits, and wine was the purpose for which all grapes were grown until\r\nthe Catawba, the Concord and the Delaware whetted the appetites of fruit\r\neaters for a dessert grape.\r\n\r\nIn the history of the amelioration of the American grapes we can skip\r\nthe period from the early settlement of the country, a period\r\nrepresented by the above quotations, to the first years of the United\r\nStates as a lapse of time in which there were no steps forward and in\r\nwhich even information concerning grapes was scarcely increased. The\r\nevolution of American grapes began with the opening of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, about the only accounts of grapes during the eighteenth century\r\nworthy of note being those of John Lawson, 1714; Robert Beverly, 1722;\r\nCol. Robert Bolling, 1765; Edward Antill, 1769; and Peter Legaux, 1800.\r\nAll of these writers excepting Lawson were concerned with European\r\ngrapes, and their relations to grape-growing were therefore discussed in\r\nthe chapter on the Old World grape. It remains, however, to call\r\nattention to such statements as were made by them of American grapes.\r\n\r\nJohn Lawson, a Scotch engineer, spent eight years, beginning in 1700,\r\nexploring and surveying North Carolina. A part of this time he was\r\nSurveyor General for the State and through natural desire and vocation\r\nhe became familiar with the flora of North Carolina. In his history of\r\nthat State, written in 1714, he gives an account of its natural\r\nresources in which the grapes of the region are several times described.\r\nHe distinguishes six kinds, three of which he mentions as having been\r\nremoved to the gardens. His fullest account runs as follows:[55]\r\n\r\n\"Among the natural fruits, the vine takes first place, of which I find\r\nsix sorts, very well known. The first is the black bunch grapes which\r\nyield a crimson juice. These grow common and bear plentifully, they are\r\nof a good relish, though not large, yet well knit in the clusters. They\r\nhave a thickish skin and large stone, which makes them not yield much\r\njuice. There is another sort of black grapes like the former in all\r\nrespects, save that their juice is of a light flesh color, inclining to\r\na white. I once saw a spontaneous white bunch grape in Carolina; but the\r\ncattle browzing on the sprouts thereof in the spring, it died. Of those\r\nwhich we call fox grapes, we have four sorts; two whereof are called\r\nsummer grapes, because ripe in July; the other two winter fruits,\r\nbecause not ripe till September or October. The summer fox grapes grow\r\nnot in clusters or great bunches, but are about five or six in a bunch,\r\nabout the bigness of a damson or larger. The black sort are frequent,\r\nthe white not so commonly found. They always grow in swamps and low,\r\nmoist lands, running sometimes very high and being shady, and therefore\r\nproper for arbours. They afford the largest leaf I ever saw to my\r\nremembrance, the back of which is of a white horse flesh color. This\r\nfruit always ripens in the shade. I have transplanted them into my\r\norchard and find they thrive well, if manured. A neighbor of mine has\r\ndone the same; mine were by slips, his from the roots, which thrive to\r\nadmiration, and bear fruit, though not so juicy as the European grape,\r\nbut of a glutinous nature. However it is pleasant enough to eat.\r\n\r\n\"The other winter fox grapes are much of the same bigness. These refuse\r\nno ground, swampy or dry, but grow plentifully on the sand hills along\r\nthe sea coast and elsewhere, and are great bearers. I have seen near\r\ntwelve bushels upon one vine of the black sort. Some of these, when\r\nthoroughly ripe, have a very pretty vinous taste and eat very well, yet\r\nare glutinous. The white sort are clear and transparent, and indifferent\r\nsmall stones. Being removed by the slip or root, they thrive well in our\r\ngardens, and make pleasant shades.\"\r\n\r\nIn another part of his history, Lawson says that in 1708 the French\r\nHuguenots on Trent River, North Carolina, were cultivating European\r\ngrapes for wine-making.[56] Again he devotes several pages to the\r\nsubject of grape-growing in North Carolina.[57] He held that this \"noble\r\nvegetable\" could be brought to the same perfection as in similar\r\nlatitudes in Europe. He states that Nathaniel Johnson had rejected all\r\nexotic vines and was cultivating native sorts from which he was making\r\nexcellent wine. Lawson admonishes his readers that in a new country the\r\nsettlers are under the necessity of making use of the natural products\r\nof the soil of which, in Carolina, the wild grape is most worthy of\r\nnotice. He calls attention to the fact that conditions are so different\r\nin America that European methods of cultivation and care cannot be\r\nfollowed. Lastly he states that he had planted seeds from the white\r\ngrapes of Madeira from which he hoped to raise a vineyard. Lawson is\r\ndeserving of esteem as an energetic pioneer, an accurate historian, as\r\none of the first American naturalists, and as an early vineyardist and\r\nhorticulturist, for he experimented with other fruits than the grape.\r\nPoor Lawson was burned to death by the Indians in the prime of his\r\ncareer, cutting short experiments which might have materially hastened\r\nthe establishment of viticulture in America.\r\n\r\nThe best account of the grapes of Virginia given in the later colonial\r\ntimes is that of the historian Robert Beverly who is very explicit in\r\nhis description of the sorts growing wild in that State. He describes\r\nthem as follows:[58] \"Grapes grow there [Virginia] in an incredible\r\nplenty, and variety; some of which are very sweet and pleasant to the\r\ntaste, others rough and harsh, and perhaps fitter for wine or brandy. I\r\nhave seen great trees covered with single vines, and those vines almost\r\nhid with the grapes. Of these wild grapes, besides those large ones in\r\nthe mountains, mentioned by Batt in his discovery, I have observed four\r\nvery different kinds, viz:\r\n\r\n\"One of the sorts grows among the sand banks, upon the edges of the low\r\ngrounds, and islands next the bay, and sea, and also in the swamps and\r\nbreaches of the uplands. They grow thin in small bunches, and upon very\r\nlow vines. These are noble grapes; and though they are wild in the\r\nwoods, are as large as the Dutch gooseberry. One species of them is\r\nwhite, others purple, blue and black, but all much alike in flavor; and\r\nsome long, some round.\r\n\r\n\"A second kind is produced throughout the whole country, in the swamps\r\nand sides of hills. These also grow upon small vines, and in small\r\nbunches; but are themselves the largest grapes as big as the English\r\nbullace, and of a rank taste when ripe, resembling the smell of a fox,\r\nfrom whence they are called fox grapes. Both these sorts make admirable\r\ntarts, being of a fleshly substance, and perhaps, if rightly managed,\r\nmight make good raisins.\r\n\r\n\"There are two species more, that are common to the whole country, some\r\nof which are black, and some blue on the outside, and some white. They\r\ngrow upon vast, large vines, and bear very plentifully. The nice\r\nobserver might, perhaps, distinguish them into several kinds, because\r\nthey differ in color, size and relish; but I shall divide them only into\r\ntwo, viz: the early, and the late ripe. The early ripe common grape is\r\nmuch larger, sweeter, and better than the other. Of these some are quite\r\nblack, and others blue, and some white or yellow; some also ripen three\r\nweeks, or a month before the other. The distance of their ripening, is\r\nfrom the latter end of August, to the latter end of October. The late\r\nripe common grapes are less than any other, neither are they so pleasant\r\nto the taste. They hang commonly to the latter end of November, or till\r\nChristmas; all that I have seen of these are black. Of the former of\r\nthese two sorts, the French refugees at the Monacan Town made a sort of\r\nclaret, though they were gathered off of the wild vines in the woods. I\r\nwas told by a very good judge who tasted it, that it was a pleasant,\r\nstrong, and full-bodied wine. From which we may conclude, that if the\r\nwine was but tolerably good, when made of the wild grape, which is\r\nshaded by the woods from the sun, it would be much better, if produced\r\nof the same grape cultivated in a regular vineyard.\"\r\n\r\nBeverly could write with some authority on grapes for he was at that\r\ntime much interested in the general question of grape-growing. Besides\r\nhe was of an inquiring mind and seems to have been an untiring\r\nexperimenter with the agricultural plants of his own and other lands.\r\nCharles Campbell in his introduction to the reprint of _Beverly's\r\nVirginia_ in 1855, gives the following account of a vineyard planted by\r\nthe historian: \"John Fontaine, son of a Huguenot refugee, having come\r\nover from England to Virginia, visited Robert Beverly, the author of\r\nthis work, in the year 1715, at his residence, near the head of the\r\nMattapony. Here he cultivated several varieties of the grape, native and\r\nFrench, in a vineyard of about three acres, situated upon the side of a\r\nhill, from which he made in that year four hundred gallons of wine. He\r\nwent to very considerable expense in this enterprise, having constructed\r\nvaults of a wine-cellar. But Fontaine comparing his method with that\r\nused in Spain, deemed it erroneous, and that his vineyard was not\r\nrightly managed. The home-made wine Fontaine drank heartily of, and\r\nfound it good, but he was satisfied by the flavor of it that Beverly did\r\nnot understand how to make it properly. * * * He had laid a sort of\r\nwager with some of the neighboring planters, he giving them one guinea\r\nin hand, and they promising to pay him each ten guineas, if in seven\r\nyears he should cultivate a vineyard that would yield at one vintage\r\nseven hundred gallons of wine. Beverly thereupon paid them down one\r\nhundred pounds, and Fontaine entertained no doubt but that in the next\r\nyear he would win the thousand guineas.\" And Beverly won the guineas.\r\n\r\nBolling in his _Sketch of Vine Culture_, 1765, mentions native grapes\r\nonly as they indicate to him the adaptability of the country for the\r\nEuropean sorts. Yet he suggests, and was probably the first to do so,\r\nthe possibility of hybridization between American and the European\r\nspecies. He says: \"Would it not be well for us to attempt the raising of\r\nnew varieties, by marrying our native with foreign vines?\" He then gives\r\na plan whereby the vines may be planted as to \"so interlock their\r\nbranches as that they shall be completely blended together.\" He says,\r\n\"they will then feed from the blossoms of each other, and when the fruit\r\nis ripe, and if seeds are saved from it and sown in nurseries, * * * it\r\nis probable that we shall obtain other varieties better adapted to our\r\nclimates and better for wine and table, than either of those kinds from\r\nwhich they sprung.\" Beyond these brief mentions Bolling does not discuss\r\nnative grapes, though he tells of the origin of the Bland grape, which\r\nwe now know to be a native, and wrongly says that it grew from the seed\r\nof a European raisin.\r\n\r\nAntill, in his _Essay on the Cultivation of the Vine_, a treatise\r\ndiscussed in the previous chapter, gives no varieties of native grapes,\r\nthough he says that he had just entered upon a trial of them. His brief\r\ndiscussion of American vines is well worth quoting in full as showing\r\nthe status of the species known to Antill just previous to the\r\nRevolutionary War:[59]\r\n\r\n\"The reason for my being silent about vines that are natives of America,\r\nis, that I know but little of them, having but just entered upon a trial\r\nof them, when my very ill state of health forbade me to proceed: From\r\nwhat little observation I have been able to make, I look upon them to be\r\nmuch more untractable than those of Europe, they will undergo a hard\r\nstruggle indeed, before they will submit to a low and humble state, a\r\nstate of abject slavery. They are very hardy and will stand a frame, for\r\nthey brave the severest storms and winter blasts, they shrink not at\r\nsnow, ice, hail or rain; the wine they will make, I imagine from the\r\nausterity of their taste, will be strong and masculine.\r\n\r\n\"The Fox-Grape, whose berries are large and round, is divided into three\r\nsorts, the white, the dark red and the black; the berries grow but thin\r\nupon the bunches, which are plain without shoulders. They delight most\r\nin a rich sandy lome, here they grow very large and the berries are\r\nsweetest, but they will grow in any grounds, wet or dry; those that grow\r\non high dry grounds generally become white, and the colour alters to a\r\ndark red or black, according to the lowness and wetness of the ground;\r\nthe situation I think must greatly affect the Wine, in strength,\r\ngoodness and colour; the berries are generally ripe the beginning of\r\nSeptember, and when fully ripe they soon fall away; thus much I have\r\nobserved as they grow wild. What alteration they may undergo, or how\r\nmuch they may be improved by proper soils and due cultivation I cannot\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\"There is a small black Grape, a size bigger than the winter Grape, that\r\nis ripe in September; it is pleasant to eat, and makes a very pretty\r\nWine, which I have drank of, it was four years old, and seemed to be the\r\nbetter for its age; the colour was amber, owing to the want of knowing\r\nhow to extract the tincture; this Grape is seldom to be found; there is\r\na Vine of them near John Taylor, Esq; at Middletown, Monmouth, and there\r\nare some of them in Mr. Livingston's Vineyard at Piscataqua in\r\nNew-Jersey. I think they are well worth propagating.\r\n\r\n\"The frost or winter Grape is known to every body, both the bunches and\r\nberries are small, and yield but little juice, but the richness of the\r\nWine may make up for the smallness of the quantity; the taste of the\r\nGrape is austere till pretty hard frosts come, and then it takes a\r\nfavourable turn and becomes very sweet and agreeable; this Vine shoots\r\nforth great numbers of slender branches, and might do very well for the\r\nsouth and southeast sides of a summer-house or close walk, if all the\r\nuseless and barren branches were cut away.\r\n\r\n\"The Vines of America are fit for strong high espaliers, but if I\r\nmistake not, he must watch them narrowly, must take away every\r\nunnecessary and unprofitable branch, and trim them sharp and close, that\r\nmeans to keep them within bounds.\"\r\n\r\nPeter Legaux, in his patriotic address \"To the People of the American\r\nStates,\"[60] wherein he admonishes them the culture of the vine is a\r\nnational duty, was intent, as we have seen, on making the Old World\r\ngrape grow in America--even if it were necessary to palm off an American\r\nsort as an Old World kind. He dismisses American grapes with even less\r\nattention than Antill gave them, his sole notice of them being embodied\r\nin the remarks that \"with skillful management many of them would make\r\ngood and wholesome wines\" and that \"if the native grapes of America are\r\nnot the most eligible for vineyards, others are now within the reach of\r\nits inhabitants.\" Indirectly he was, however, of great service in\r\ndistributing the first native varieties, for as Rafinesque says, \"by\r\ncalling our Bland and Alexander grapes _Madeira_ and _Cape_, he was\r\ninstrumental in diffusing them among those who would not have noticed\r\nnor bought them if known as native vines.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing Legaux's address of 1800 several treatises were written within\r\na few years which give us a very clear idea of the status of the\r\nAmerican grapes at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Chief of\r\nthese, and probably in chronological order, is a paper in _The Domestic\r\nEncyclopedia_ on the vine, written by James Mease, M. D.[61] It appears\r\nthat Dr. Mease wrote in 1802 but the Encyclopedia did not appear until\r\n1804.[62] Embodied in the article is an \"interesting paper on the vines\r\nof the United States drawn up by William Bartram at the request of the\r\neditor.\" Bartram's paper was written in the spring of 1802. Mease's\r\ndiscussion of the vine merits especial attention. While the best of\r\nAntill's and Legaux's observations are made use of, yet much is added to\r\nthem and the paper is far more reasonable in every respect than those of\r\neither of the two previous writers, and is wholly lacking in the\r\nostentatious modesty and circumlocution of Antill and the grandiloquence\r\nand self esteem of Legaux. It may justly be considered the first\r\nrational discussion of the culture of the grape in America.\r\n\r\nMease's paper deserves attention for another reason. It contains the\r\nfirst public utterance condemning the culture of the Old World grape and\r\nrecommending the cultivation of native grapes. He says: \"From the\r\nexperience, however, of the editor and his friends who have found much\r\ndifficulty in naturalizing foreign vines, he recommends the cultivation\r\nof the native grapes of the United States, particularly the _Vitis\r\nsylvestris_, [_Vitis aestivalis_] or small blue or bunch grape; Bland's,\r\nTasker's or Alexander's, and the bull-grape of Carolina and Georgia.\" It\r\nappears from the whole discussion by Mease and Bartram in this treatise\r\nthat the only varieties of native grapes cultivated in 1804 were\r\nAlexander's or Tasker's grape, Bland's grape, the Bull grape[63] of\r\nCarolina and Georgia, and the Raccoon grape.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, 1806, S. W. Johnson[64] and Bernard McMahon[65]\r\npublished accounts of the cultivation of the vine. Johnson mentions\r\nthree American varieties, the \"Bull or Bullet grape, Bland's grape and\r\nthe Alexander's or Tasker's grape.\" Johnson has nothing to say of the\r\ndesirability of cultivating the above or other native sorts and confines\r\nhis discussion largely to Legaux's work with European grapes. McMahon\r\nadvocates the introduction of foreign grapes and says almost nothing\r\nabout the native species. As American varieties he mentions those given\r\nby Johnson, omitting the Bull grape.\r\n\r\nOne of the first, if not the first, extensive centers of native\r\ngrape-growing in America was about York, Pennsylvania. In 1818, Mr.\r\nThomas Eichelberger, an enterprising German vine-grower, set out four\r\nacres of grapes at this place and demonstrated that grapes could be\r\ngrown successfully. The original vineyard was increased to about twenty\r\nacres and other plantations were made until in 1826 there were in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of the borough of York one hundred and fifty\r\nacres of vineyards. The account of these vineyards states further:[66]\r\n\"In Adam and Westmoreland the culture of the vine is also attended to\r\nand one gentleman in Chester has a vineyard of thirty acres.\" The grape\r\nmost commonly grown in this region was known to the growers as \"Black or\r\nYork Madeira\" and was supposed to have been introduced from the Island\r\nof Madeira. Prince pronounced the grape to be a native and the then\r\ncommonly grown Alexander. Other popular sorts in this region were the\r\nYork Claret, a native resembling Alexander; and York Lisbon, described\r\nas \"having considerable affinity to Alexander but having a larger and\r\nmore acid fruit.\" Beside these there were several less well known sorts\r\nnone of which is heard of now. Before the industry began to wane about\r\nYork the Catawba and Isabella had taken the place of the first named\r\nsorts and these eventually succumbed for most part to grape diseases. In\r\nlooking up the history of varieties of grapes for this work, a\r\nsurprisingly large number have been traced back to this early center of\r\nthe industry, so many that York and Lancaster Counties, Pennsylvania,\r\nmust be counted among the starting places of American viticulture.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that for some years previous to Johnson and McMahon there\r\nhad been efforts to grow _Vitis vinifera_ in many widely separated\r\nregions. The futility of attempting to grow the Old World grape became\r\napparent, so far as we may judge from written accounts, to but few men,\r\nhowever. To Dr. James Mease must be accorded the honor of first\r\nperceiving and setting forth in print the fact that American viticulture\r\nmust rise from native grapes. Possibly the second man to voice the same\r\nsentiment was Thomas Jefferson, ever alert for the agricultural welfare\r\nof the country, who wrote to John Adlum in 1809, speaking of the\r\nAlexander grape:[67] \"I think it will be well to push the culture of\r\nthat grape without losing time and efforts in search of foreign vines,\r\nwhich it will take centuries to adapt to our soil and climate.\" It is\r\nprobable that Jefferson, who it appears was a frequent correspondent of\r\nAdlum's, stimulated the latter to the publication of a book on grape\r\nculture. This appeared in 1823, \"for the purpose\", as the author says in\r\nhis preface, \"of diffusing some practical and useful information\r\nthroughout the country on the best method of cultivating the native\r\ngrape and of making Wine\".\r\n\r\nThus Adlum's[68] _Cultivation of the Vine_ was the first American book\r\non American grapes. The author's intentions, as indicated in his\r\npreface, quoted above, were good; but his book, as an exposition on\r\nnative grape culture, is a failure. The work is concerned for most part\r\nwith wine-making and his cultural directions are taken almost wholly,\r\nsuch as they are, from European books. In the last four pages of the\r\ntreatise he describes twenty-two varieties of grapes of which perhaps a\r\ndozen are native sorts. In this edition the Catawba is described as the\r\nTokay but in a second edition, published in 1828, the name is changed\r\nfrom Tokay to Catawba. Adlum was one of the first to call attention to\r\nthe Catawba and was at the time its chief distributor. He advocated in\r\nhis book, and in the papers of the time, the establishment of an\r\nexperimental farm[69] upon which could be grown \"cuttings of the\r\ndifferent species of the native Vine to be found in the United States,\r\nto ascertain their growth, soil, and produce, and to exhibit to the\r\nNation, a new source of wealth, which has been too long neglected.\"\r\n\r\nAdlum did not write from theory alone for he was the owner and\r\ncultivator of vineyards near Georgetown, in the District of Columbia,\r\nwhere he grew both native and foreign grapes. The latter he finally\r\ndiscarded with the statement that the way to success in America \"is to\r\ndrop most kinds of foreign vines at once (except a few for the table)\r\nand seek for the best kinds of our largest native Grapes\". The best\r\ninformation from Adlum's pen regarding native grapes and their culture\r\nis to be found in the _American Farmer_, published in Baltimore. He\r\nwrote mainly during the years 1824 to 1830. He was neither a clear nor\r\nan accurate writer and his imagination and enthusiasm had full sway at\r\nall times; yet, notwithstanding these faults, he must be counted as one\r\nof the geniuses of his day, as devoted to the welfare of the country, as\r\nhaving almost a prophetic vision, and as actuated by the best of\r\nmotives. His struggle for a national experimental vineyard, the work of\r\nhis pen, his dissemination of the Catawba and other grapes, and his\r\nvineyard experiments, give Adlum a high place among the improvers of\r\nAmerican grapes.\r\n\r\nJohn James Dufour gives the next glimpse of the beginnings of American\r\nviticulture in his _Vine Dresser's Guide_ published in Cincinnati in\r\n1826. It is but a glimpse, however, for Dufour was a foreigner, and, as\r\nwe have seen, came to America to grow the Old World grape. His efforts\r\nat grape-growing furnished the climax to the two centuries of failures\r\nin growing _Vitis vinifera_ in America but did not benefit the new\r\nviticulture of the country greatly.[70] His only contribution of note\r\nwas one made in spite of himself, namely the introduction of the\r\nAlexander, which he incorrectly called Cape, an American grape, as a\r\ncommercial variety, Legaux having first brought it prominently to\r\nnotice. Dufour would never admit that this variety, the only one to\r\nsucceed in his vineyards in Kentucky and Indiana, was a native grape and\r\nsays of it in the preface of his book: \"I will also try to save the\r\ncharacter of our Cape grapes from being made merely wild grapes, because\r\nsome are now found in the woods; and, to put any one in the way to\r\ndistinguish wild from tame grapes, I will give the description of the\r\nbotanical characters of the blossom of both sorts.\" In his text he\r\nfulfills the promise in the preface and devotes some pages to \"save the\r\ncharacter of our Cape grapes.\"\r\n\r\nDufour's visit of inspection of the vineyards of the country in 1799 has\r\nbeen noted in discussing the Old World grape. In this trip only foreign\r\ngrapes interested him and he mentioned the wild species but to condemn\r\nthem for cultivation. In his book published twenty-seven years later he\r\nshows no change of opinion and though at this time there were a number\r\nof meritorious native sorts he describes only European varieties. Dufour\r\nwas a true foreigner and could find little of value in the New World\r\nthat did not come from the Old World.\r\n\r\nRafinesque, writing in 1830, in his _American Manual of the Grape\r\nVines_, gives an account of forty-one species of native grapes.\r\nUnfortunately his \"species\" are founded upon the slightest differences\r\nin vine or fruit and his observations were so poorly made that his\r\nbotanical studies of the grape are now wholly discredited by botanists.\r\nHe gives an account of the acreage in vineyards existing in the United\r\nStates in 1825 and 1830. This is the earliest estimate of the vineyard\r\nacreage of the country and is therefore a landmark in American\r\nviticulture. It is as follows:[71] \"In 1825 I collected an account of\r\nour principal vineyards and nurseries of vines. They were then only 60\r\nof 1 to 20 acres each, altogether 600 acres. While now, in 1830, they\r\namount to 200 of 3 to 40 acres, or nearly 5000 acres of vineyards. Thus\r\nhaving increased tenfold within 5 years, at which rate they promise to\r\nbecome a permanent and increasing cultivation.\"\r\n\r\nViticulture took its place in the literature of American pomology with\r\nthe advent of William Robert Prince's _A Treatise on the Vine_. This\r\nwork, magnificent compared with similar books of the time, introduces\r\nnative grapes to the fruit-growers of America. Prince was the fourth\r\nproprietor of the same name of the Prince nurseries at Flushing, Long\r\nIsland, and he with his predecessors had assiduously cultivated European\r\nvarieties of grapes hoping to acclimatize them to American conditions.\r\nIt is not a matter of wonder therefore, that much of his book is devoted\r\nto foreign grapes. His collection at Flushing consisted of over four\r\nhundred and fifty sorts and many of these he describes. In spite of his\r\nattraction to the foreign varieties, some of which had been tested in\r\nhis nursery for two or three generations, Prince admitted the\r\nimpossibility of growing them successfully and recommends to his readers\r\nand patrons the cultivation of native varieties. In the latter regard he\r\nsays: \"* * * after all my own experiments I have come to this\r\nconclusion, that to establish vineyards of the most profitable\r\ndescription, with a certainty of regular crops in localities north of\r\nthe highlands in this state, _native varieties alone should be\r\nselected_; and the whole of the eastern states will of course be\r\ncomprised in this remark.\"\r\n\r\nIn his treatise, Prince described about seventy varieties of native\r\ngrapes and several of the native species. Prince's descriptions of these\r\ngrapes are comprehensive and judging from the sorts described by him\r\nwhich we now have they are accurate. He grew seedlings from many of\r\nthem. He showed a knowledge of the possibilities of hybridization of\r\nAmerican species with _Vitis vinifera_. He solicited and obtained seeds\r\nand vines from all the settled portions of the Union. His grape\r\ncorrespondents in different parts of America and of the world must have\r\nnumbered hundreds. Prince's enthusiasm and perseverance in grape culture\r\nattached to him votaries in all fruit regions and to him more than to\r\nany other man was due that friendly interchange of knowledge and\r\nsentiment regarding grapes which characterized the half century after\r\nthe appearance of his book. Such co-operation as was manifested in\r\ngrape-growing in the second and third quarters of the nineteenth century\r\nhas never been known in the culture of any other species of plant in\r\nthis country and to it is largely due the progress of viticulture in\r\nleaps and bounds dating from Prince's time.\r\n\r\nWith the close of the year 1830, we may consider viticulture a firmly\r\nestablished industry in America with the native grapes as a basis.\r\nRafinesque's estimate of the acreage at this time is given on a\r\npreceding page (47). It is worth while considering, very briefly, the\r\ntypes of grapes under cultivation at this stage of the industry, with\r\nsome discussion of the origin of the leading varieties.\r\n\r\nThe first grape to become generally distributed as a commercial variety,\r\nwas, as has been remarked before, the Alexander, or Cape. It came into\r\nprominence, through the deception of Legaux and the credulity of Dufour,\r\nas one of the Viniferas commonly grown at the Cape of Good Hope. It\r\nproved, however, to be an offshoot of the fox grape of the woods, _Vitis\r\nlabrusca_, and had been grown, long before Legaux palmed it off as the\r\nCape, under the names Alexander and Tasker's, Alexander because of its\r\nhaving been grown by a gardener of this name and Tasker's through its\r\ncultivation on a somewhat extensive scale by a Mr. Tasker in Maryland.\r\nIts history dates back to the years before the Revolutionary War and its\r\norigin was probably on the banks of the Schuylkill in Pennsylvania,\r\nhence another of its many synonyms, Schuylkill Muscadell.\r\n\r\nOf the several other native varieties of the Labrusca type cultivated in\r\n1830, two deserve attention for their intrinsic and historical value.\r\nThe Catawba, of uncertain origin, as we shall see in its history, and\r\nthe Isabella, a native of South Carolina, are both classed by most\r\nviticulturists as of the fox or Labrusca type. The two varieties were\r\ndistributed among vine-growers at about the same time but the Catawba,\r\nbecause of its superior merits, soon took the lead and at the time of\r\nwhich we write was by far the most popular native grape. These, with the\r\nAlexander, may certainly be considered the forerunners of the cultivated\r\ngrapes of the species to which they belong. The Catawba is still in\r\nseveral great grape regions of the country the standard commercial\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nWhile varieties of _Vitis labrusca_ were first cultivated in the North,\r\nit is probable that _Vitis rotundifolia_ furnished the first\r\ndomesticated varieties for the South, and likely, too, before the\r\nnorthern kinds were cultivated. Among these are the white and black\r\nScuppernongs, or bullet grapes. _Vitis rotundifolia_, while it refuses\r\nto grow out of its habitat, runs riot from Maryland to Florida from\r\nseashore to mountains and in many diverse soils. The Scuppernongs[72]\r\nare natural offshoots of this species and are known in the South in\r\nlegend, tradition and history. Undoubtedly they were cultivated for\r\ntheir fruit or as ornamentals in garden or vineyards from the earliest\r\ncolonial times. It is certain that wine was made from the different wild\r\ntypes of _Vitis rotundifolia_ from the settlement of Jamestown and if\r\nnot brought under cultivation at an early day it was because the\r\nbountifulness of the wild vines obviated the necessity of domesticating\r\nthem. It was of this grape that Amadas and Barlowe wrote in 1584 \"in all\r\nthe world the like abundance is not to be found.\"\r\n\r\nThe word Scuppernong[73] is often used to designate a group of grapes\r\nrather than as a varietal name; for, there are the black Scuppernong,\r\nthe white or green Scuppernong and the red Scuppernong, all much alike\r\nexcept in color of fruit and in a few minor characters of vine. Indeed,\r\nwhere _Vitis rotundifolia_ grows wild, all of the forms are often\r\nincluded in the term Scuppernong. The species is often known, too, as\r\nthe Muscadine or Southern Muscadine.\r\n\r\nWhile the Labruscas were becoming established in the North and the\r\nScuppernongs in the South, two other species, one northern and one\r\nsouthern, came into prominence with varieties which for wine-making at\r\nleast were far superior to any other native sorts. The southern species\r\nis _Vitis aestivalis_, best represented then and now by Norton while the\r\nnorthern species is _Vitis riparia_ and its variety under cultivation\r\nwas the Clinton, which still remains one of the best representatives of\r\nthe species.[74] It is strange that these four species were brought\r\nunder cultivation only when wild forms of them, so striking in value\r\nthat they still remain a hundred years later standard cultivated\r\nvarieties, had been found. _Vitis labrusca_ represented by Catawba,\r\n_Vitis rotundifolia_, by Scuppernong, _Vitis aestivalis_, by Norton, and\r\n_Vitis riparia_, by Clinton, are, after a century of improvement, with\r\nseveral hundred varieties, scarcely excelled by others of their\r\nspecies. Yet it is not so much the wonder that grape-breeders have so\r\nlittle improved upon these first varieties, as that our forefathers\r\ncould allow them to grow comparatively neglected at their doors for two\r\ncenturies while they wasted time in the attempt to grow a foreign grape\r\nthat had been a failure from the very start.\r\n\r\nOther species had also been tried at this time. Those indefatigable\r\nbotanists and horticulturists, the Princes, had grown plants of what we\r\nnow know as _Vitis aestivalis lincecumii_ Munson, _Vitis longii_ Prince,\r\nand _Vitis cordifolia_ Michx., but without finding them of value. It is\r\ninteresting to note that the first named species, the Post-oak grape,\r\nnow promises to furnish valuable varieties for the South and that it has\r\nsome characters desirable for the North if they can be combined with\r\nthose of our northern species.\r\n\r\nWe have followed the grape through the settlement, colonization and\r\nfirst statehood days of the United States. We have seen that it had its\r\npart, and no mean one, in these dramatic periods. We have found that the\r\nwild grapes of the country, valued but uncultivated for two hundred\r\nyears, became through mere transplanting from the woods into the\r\nvineyards, without the slow modifications which nearly all other plants\r\nhave had to undergo, one of our most important fruits. The domestication\r\nof four species of American grapes has been briefly traced. The\r\nbeginning of American viticulture has been set, somewhat arbitrarily, at\r\n1830, the date of the publication of William Prince's _Treatise on the\r\nVine_. It remains now to discuss the economic progress of the industry\r\nwe have seen launched.\r\n\r\nThe twenty years following 1830 comprise a period of expansion in\r\ngrape-growing unmarked by the introduction of new types or of any new\r\nvarieties of particular note. During this time a grape and wine industry\r\nof considerable magnitude was developed about Cincinnati, and the Ohio\r\nRiver became known as the Rhine of America--a title long since lost and\r\nnow applied to the Keuka Lake region in New York. According to\r\nBuchanan,[75] there were 1550 acres of grapes in the Ohio Valley within\r\ntwenty miles of Cincinnati; between forty and fifty acres near Hermann,\r\nMissouri; a few vineyards at Belleville, Illinois; and wine was being\r\nmade from the Scuppernong grape in North and South Carolina. The\r\ninference from Buchanan is that the above plantations were for the\r\nproduction of wine; for he specifies that a few vineyards were in\r\ncultivation about New York, Philadelphia and Burlington, New Jersey,\r\n\"but more with a view to supply the market with grapes, than to make\r\nwine.\"\r\n\r\nThe last statement is significant for it indicates a change in the grape\r\nindustry which really gave life to the viticulture of eastern America.\r\nUntil about 1850, grapes were considered valuable and were cultivated\r\nonly for wine-making. Previous to this time the literature on the grape\r\nwas concerned more with wine-making than with cultivation, varieties or\r\nany other phase of the industry. The American grapes, with few\r\nexceptions, do not make good wines; there were few men in the country\r\nuntil within recent years who understood wine-making; and the American\r\npeople do not take kindly to wines. It was not, therefore, possible to\r\nestablish viticulture as an industry of any magnitude in eastern America\r\nwhen grapes were used for wine alone. It was only when the demand for\r\ntable grapes was created and when transportation and market facilities\r\npermitted the supply of the demand that the industry took form and\r\nsubstance. It is a significant fact that in those regions in the eastern\r\nUnited States in which grape-growing has been founded and which are\r\nchiefly dependent on wine-making, the industry has not prospered or has\r\nflourished but temporarily.\r\n\r\nWe have had Rafinesque's survey of the grape industry of the country in\r\n1830 and Buchanan's in 1850. The next record, and a far more complete\r\none than either of the above, is found in a consular report made by E.\r\nM. Erskine, Secretary of the British Legation at Washington, to the\r\nBritish government in 1859. Mr. Erskine reported the acreage as\r\nfollows:[76] \"The banks of the River Ohio are studded with vineyards,\r\nbetween 1,500 and 2,000 acres being planted in the immediate vicinity of\r\nCincinnati, with every prospect of a vast increase. At Cleveland, Ohio,\r\non the southern shore of Lake Erie, there are 100 acres under vine\r\nculture; at Hermann, on the Missouri, 80 miles west of St. Louis, 150 or\r\n200 acres are cultivated almost entirely by Germans; at Booneville,\r\nhigher up the same river; at Belleville, on the 'rolling prairies' of\r\nIllinois; at Reading, in Pennsylvania; in Kentucky, Indiana, Tennessee,\r\nArkansas, and generally, in at least twenty-two out of the thirty-two\r\nStates now constituting the Union, vineyards of more or less promise and\r\nextent have been planted. * * *\r\n\r\n\"About 3,000 acres are cultivated as vineyards in the state of Ohio; 500\r\nin Kentucky; 1,000 in Indiana; 500 in Missouri; 500 in Illinois; 100 in\r\nGeorgia; 300 in North Carolina; 200 in South Carolina, with every\r\nprospect of a rapid increase in all. It is calculated that at least\r\n2,000,000 gallons of wine are now raised in the United States, the\r\naverage value of which may be taken at a dollar and a half the gallon.\"\r\n\r\nGrape-growing in New York was not considered worthy of mention by\r\nErskine; and Buchanan nine years before reported only a few vineyards\r\nabout New York City. In the regions of this State now almost wholly\r\ndevoted to grape-growing a start had hardly been made in 1850. Yet there\r\nwere some commercial vineyards at this time. Deacon Elijah Fay, the\r\npioneer grape-grower in what is now the great Chautauqua region, planted\r\nthe first vines in that district in 1818 and though grape-growing did\r\nnot become of importance until three or four decades later yet this\r\nplanting was the foundation upon which Deacon Fay built until, largely\r\nthrough his efforts and example and those of his children, grapes were\r\ngrown everywhere about his home. It is doubtful, however, if there were\r\na hundred acres of commercial vineyards in this region when Erskine made\r\nhis report in 1859.\r\n\r\nThe first plantings made about Keuka Lake, now called the \"Rhine of\r\nAmerica\", were made by the Rev. William Bostwick at Hammondsport about\r\n1830. He grew the Catawba and Isabella in a small way in his garden and\r\nfor years was the only grape-grower in this part of New York. The\r\ncommercial industry in this region was not started until 1853 when\r\nAndrew Reisinger, a German vintner, planted two acres of Isabellas and\r\nCatawbas at Harmonyville in the town of Pulteney. From this start\r\nviticulture in the Keuka region grew apace and there must have been four\r\nor five hundred acres of grapes planted when Erskine's report was made\r\nin 1859. The fact that the region was not mentioned in this report may\r\nbe accounted for by assuming that Erskine's figures came from men\r\nengaged in making wine and at this time wine was not made in large\r\nquantities in the Keuka district.\r\n\r\nThere had been experimental vineyards about New York City and along the\r\nHudson for a century before the time of which we are writing, but these,\r\nas we have seen, being largely of foreign grapes, came to naught.\r\nProbably native grapes were first planted there in a commercial way by\r\nthe French Huguenots who settled in Ulster and Orange Counties. At any\r\nrate there is record of a vineyard planted by a Frenchman, John Jacques,\r\nnear Washingtonville in 1837. The varieties were Isabella and Catawba\r\nand there were, all told, about half an acre. It is interesting to note\r\nthat this vineyard is still producing grapes and that some of the vines\r\nare as vigorous as in their first maturity. Wine-making as an industry\r\nhas existed in this region since the vineyard of 1837 came into bearing\r\nbut it was not until several years later that table grapes were grown\r\nfor the market. In 1859 there must have been two or three hundred acres\r\nof grapes in commercial vineyards in the country adjacent to the Hudson.\r\n\r\nAdding five hundred acres from New York to the 6500 reported for the\r\nUnited States by Erskine in 1859 we have 7000 acres for the whole\r\ncountry--a small estimate, for several other states known to have\r\nconsiderable acreages of commercial vineyards were not taken into\r\naccount in Erskine's survey.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to a further consideration of grape statistics we must\r\nnote two important events for American viticulture which took place just\r\nprevious to the survey which we have been discussing. One of these\r\nbrought about a revolution,--almost brought into existence commercial\r\ngrape-growing; the other stimulated and laid the foundation of\r\ngrape-breeding in this country. The first was the introduction of the\r\nConcord grape; the second was the production of hybrids between the\r\nEuropean and the native grapes.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Concord will be found in the discussion of that\r\nvariety in the chapter on _Varieties of American Grapes_. Its advent is\r\nnoted here that it may be set as a landmark in the development of\r\nAmerican grape-culture. It is first recorded in 1852 by the\r\nMassachusetts Horticultural Society as a seedling exhibited by E. W.\r\nBull. The qualities that have made the Concord so important in\r\ncommercial grape-growing are: Adaptability to varying sets of cultural\r\nconditions; fair shipping qualities; hardiness, productiveness and\r\ncomparative immunity to fungi and insects. Its influence on the\r\ngrape-growing of the country has been great, too, because from it have\r\ncome a considerable number of the most valuable varieties of American\r\ngrapes; as Worden, Moore Early, Pocklington, Martha and Cottage, all\r\npure-bred seedlings and many cross-breds.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the American Pomological Society in Philadelphia in\r\n1852, Dr. William W. Valk of Flushing, Long Island, exhibited several\r\nbunches of fruit from a seedling grape which he had grown from seeds of\r\nBlack Hamburg produced from blossoms fertilized by Isabella.[77] The\r\ncross had been made in 1845, the first fruit was borne in 1850, and in\r\n1851 specimens of it were examined by Downing who wrote, \"There can be\r\nno doubt that this is the first genuine cross between the foreign grapes\r\nand our natives.\"[78] The name of the variety, given by the originator,\r\nis Ada. Dr. Valk gave full accounts of his hybrid seedlings in the\r\n_Horticulturist_ in 1851,[79] and in the _Proceedings of the American\r\nPomological Society_ in 1852.[80] He had previously written on the\r\nsubject of hybridization, an interesting paper having been contributed\r\nto Hovey's _Magazine_ as early as 1845.[81] All available information\r\nshows that Valk's is the first recorded hybrid between a native and the\r\nforeign grape. Yet the honor of such a production has usually been given\r\nto John Fisk Allen and to the grape, Allen's Hybrid. For the conception\r\nof hybridity between species we can go back to the beginning of the\r\ncultivation of native grapes. Nearly thirty years before, Nuttall, the\r\nthen famous botanist of Harvard University, had recommended such\r\nhybridization to American grape-growers.[82] Dufour mentions its\r\npossibilities in his _Vine Dresser's Guide_.[83] In 1830, Prince\r\ndiscussed the whole matter and gave specific directions for\r\nhybridizing.[84] Indeed it is not unlikely that Prince, who says he grew\r\nten thousand seedling plants \"from an admixture under every variety of\r\ncircumstance\" grew the first such hybrid but we have nothing more\r\ndefinite as to this than the above statement.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, two years following its report of E. W. Bull's \"new seedling,\"\r\nthe Concord, the Massachusetts Horticultural Society showed in its\r\nexhibits another grape scarcely less worthy of note than the Concord. It\r\nwas a hybrid between the Golden Chasselas and the Isabella produced by\r\nJohn Fisk Allen of Salem, Massachusetts. The new variety, the Allen's\r\nHybrid, mentioned in a preceding paragraph, had some intrinsic value\r\nbut, of more importance, was the first introduction of its kind and\r\nstarted similar work which gave us many interesting and some valuable\r\ngrapes.\r\n\r\nSoon after the production of Allen's Hybrid, E. S. Rogers of Salem,\r\nMassachusetts, and J. H. Ricketts of Newburgh, New York, began to give\r\ngrape-growers varieties, the results of hybrids between _Vitis vinifera_\r\nand _Vitis labrusca_, so promising that for a time enthusiasm and\r\nspeculation ran riot. Possibly at no other period has the interest in\r\ngrape-growing been so keen as during the decade succeeding the\r\nintroduction of these hybrids. It was the \"golden era\" for the grape\r\npropagators. One old nurseryman tells of carrying, during this boom,\r\nover a thousand dollars worth of rooted grape cuttings on his back from\r\nthe nursery to the express office.\r\n\r\nThough there was no panic among grape-growers as the result of\r\nspeculation in hybrids, lovers of grapes the country over were greatly\r\ndisappointed in the hybrid varieties. The fruit of many of the hybrids\r\nproduced at this time is of superior quality and many of them are still\r\ngrown by amateurs. But the vines of all first generation hybrids with\r\nVinifera produced so far, lack hardiness, vigor and usually\r\nproductiveness; they are susceptible to fungi and the phylloxera and\r\nmany of them must be cross-pollinated to secure fruit. It is only when\r\nthe blood of the native species greatly predominates, as in Delaware,\r\nBrighton and Diamond, that we have obtained sorts of commercial value\r\nthrough the admixture of foreign blood. But the interest aroused by\r\nAllen's Hybrid still continues and in every part of the country may be\r\nfound some man who hybridizes grapes with the hope that through well\r\nplanned crosses or a lucky chance he may obtain the grape of grapes for\r\nAmerica. Such attempts, stimulated by the hybrids of the fifties, have\r\nproduced most of our American varieties.\r\n\r\nThe time between 1853, the date of the introduction of the Concord, and\r\n1880 can be singled out as the period in which viticulture made its\r\ngreat growth in eastern America. The first limit is set because the\r\nConcord gave commercial grape-growing its initial impulse; the second\r\nlimit is put at 1880, because at about that time grapes and wine from\r\nCalifornia began to compete with the eastern product to such an extent\r\nthat prices fell and plantings were curtailed. Curtailment did not begin\r\nso early as this in New York but for the country at large the period of\r\ngreat expansion ended at about 1880. Fortunately we have an accurate\r\nstatistical report of the condition of grape culture in the United\r\nStates at this time. It is found in a work entitled, _A Report Upon the\r\nStatistics of Grape Culture and Wine Production in the United States for\r\n1880_.[85] The report was compiled by Dr. William McMurtrie under the\r\ndirection of the Commissioner of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nStatistics are given for all of the states of the Union but a glance at\r\nthe tables shows that by this time viticulture had become a specialized\r\nindustry and that the areas devoted to it are more or less localized.\r\nThe main areas, with their acreage for 1880, may be set forth as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe Eastern region, comprising the States of New York and Pennsylvania,\r\n14,590 acres.\r\n\r\nThe Middle region, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, 17,634 acres.\r\n\r\nThe Western region, Kansas and Missouri, 10,918 acres.\r\n\r\nThe Southern region, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina and\r\nGeorgia, 10,707 acres.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific region, California, Arizona and New Mexico, 35,518 acres.\r\n\r\nOutside of these five regions there were in the United States, according\r\nto McMurtrie's report, 12,316 acres. The total acreage for the United\r\nStates in 1880 was 101,683 acres; the production of wine was 23,453,827\r\ngallons. Unfortunately the total production of grapes is not given.\r\n\r\nThe following data are taken from the agricultural statistics of 1890\r\nand show well the growth of viticulture in ten years though it is\r\nprobable that the figures for 1880 were far too low. For the Eastern\r\nregion, 51,000 acres; the Middle region, 42,633 acres; Western region,\r\n17,306 acres; Southern region, 17,092 acres; Pacific region, 213,230\r\nacres; for the territory outside of these divisions, 60,000 acres. Total\r\narea, 401,261 acres. Excluding the acreage of the Pacific division we\r\nhave 188,031 acres for American grapes, assuming that all of the grapes\r\ngrown on the Pacific Coast belong to _Vitis vinifera_.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that in 1890 four-fifths of the grapes grown\r\nin the Eastern region, New York and Pennsylvania, were for table use and\r\nthat in round numbers the production for this purpose amounted to 60,687\r\ntons, requiring 5000 cars for transportation. Of grapes sold to wineries\r\nthere were 15,172 tons. The varieties most largely grown were, in order\r\nnamed, Concord, Catawba, Delaware, and Niagara.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle region, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, about half the grapes\r\ngrown were for table use and half for wine. By far the largest part of\r\nthe grapes grown in this region was in Ohio, only about one-fourth of\r\nthe total area being in the other two states. Between 1880 and 1890,\r\nviticulture scarcely held its own in this division. The decrease in the\r\nvalue of the product, competition with California, and, more\r\nparticularly, ravages of insects and fungi were the causes of the\r\nfalling off in planting. In some localities many vineyards were\r\ndestroyed. The grapes sold for table use in this region amounted to\r\n50,337 tons; to wineries, 14,456 tons.\r\n\r\nSo, too, in the Western region, Missouri and Kansas, but little progress\r\nwas made during this ten years and for the same reasons, though the\r\ndevastation in Missouri was caused chiefly by black-rot, which begun to\r\nbe troublesome about 1875. The plantings in Missouri were largely for\r\nwine-making but in Kansas, which contained 5542 of the 17,306 acres for\r\nthis region, about half of the crop was sold for table use. The grapes\r\nfor table use in this region amounted to 30,794 tons, for wineries, 8290\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nThe crop in the Southern region was about equally divided between wine\r\nand table grapes, the production in 1889 amounting to 1,165,832 gallons\r\nof wine and 14,539 tons of table grapes. The new plantings about\r\nequalled the acreage destroyed so that in total area the region was\r\nabout holding its own. The chief market for the table grapes was in the\r\nNorth where they were sold early in the season at prices ranging from\r\nfifteen to twenty-five cents a pound.\r\n\r\nWe are concerned with the Pacific region in that its grape products,\r\nespecially its wines, compete with those of eastern America. The growth\r\nof viticulture in the Pacific region in the decade we are discussing was\r\nlittle short of marvelous. In 1880 the acreage was 35,518 acres and in\r\n1890, 213,230 acres--much greater than that of all the eastern regions,\r\nand the production of grapes being more than proportionately greater\r\nbecause of the greater productiveness of the vines. In this region\r\n43,414 tons were sold for table grapes; 173,037 tons for wine; 41,166\r\ntons were made into raisins and 23,252 tons used for dried grapes and\r\nother purposes than table grapes. The grand total for the region was\r\n280,869 tons against 201,270 for all of eastern America. These figures\r\ngive an idea of how formidable a competitor to eastern America\r\nCalifornia had become by 1890.\r\n\r\nThe census of 1900 shows but little increase in the total production of\r\nAmerican grapes. A few figures will show the relative status of\r\nviticulture in the several regions in 1890 and 1900.\r\n\r\n                           1890           1900\r\n                         Tons of        Tons of\r\n                       grapes grown   grapes grown\r\n\r\n  Eastern region          75,859        147,411\r\n  Middle region           64,793         58,917\r\n  Western region          39,084         14,784\r\n  Southern region         21,534         16,886\r\n  California region      280,869        362,323\r\n\r\nAll of the regions we have been discussing, in which native grapes are\r\ngrown, show a considerable falling off in production excepting the\r\neastern one where the increase more than counterbalances the decrease in\r\nthe other regions. The census report for 1900 shows three new states in\r\nthe list of those producing grapes in commercial quantities. In the\r\ndecade preceding, Michigan came up from an insignificant commercial\r\nproduction in 1890 to fifth rank in 1900 with 20,765 tons. Iowa and\r\nOklahoma, states from which grapes were not reported in commercial\r\nquantities in 1890, produced 3701 and 3055 tons in 1900.\r\n\r\nThe shifting of grape areas indicated in the above paragraph was caused\r\nfor most part by the grape diseases. The mildew and rot had ruined the\r\ngrape industry in some of the older regions. The newer regions, as in\r\nMichigan, either enjoy comparative immunity from these troubles or the\r\nvineyards had not yet been attacked by them. In the case of the eastern\r\nregion, New York and Pennsylvania, in the Chautauqua district, along the\r\nshores of Lake Erie in both states, where the production increased\r\ngreatly during this decade, the vineyards are almost wholly immune to\r\nblack-rot and are comparatively free from the mildew. In the other grape\r\ndistricts of this region these troubles are kept well in check by\r\nspraying.\r\n\r\nThe statistics given in the last few paragraphs show how greatly the\r\ngrape-growing of eastern America has increased in the last half century.\r\nWhen one considers that at the time Erskine made his survey in 1859\r\nthere were but 6100 acres of grapes in the whole of this great region\r\nand that the culture of the European varieties was impossible, the total\r\nacreage grown in 1900, namely, 237,998 acres, makes an astounding\r\nfigure. The results achieved seem all the greater when one considers\r\nthat many of the best varieties now grown are the first and scarcely any\r\nare further removed than the second generation from wild plants. It is\r\ndoubtful if any other cultivated plants have attained such importance as\r\nour native grapes in so short a time from the wild state. Yet their\r\ndomestication has scarcely begun and few who grow them realize their\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WINE[86] AND GRAPE JUICE INDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nFor over 200 years the grapes grown on this continent were almost\r\nwholly for wine-making. Yet the production of grapes was not sufficient\r\nto sustain a wine industry until the middle of the nineteenth century.\r\nWhen, with the introduction of new varieties of grapes and of better\r\nmethods of growing them, the crop became sufficient in volume to support\r\nwine-making as an industry, its progress was checked by the enormous\r\ndemand for table grapes, a demand not known in other countries, and by\r\nthe cheapness of California wines. Furthermore the grapes most commonly\r\ncultivated, as the Concord, Worden and Niagara, do not make good wines;\r\nand knowledge and facilities for wine-making have not been such that the\r\nbest wines could be made with varieties adapted for the purpose. All of\r\nthese obstacles, to which we may add the fact that Americans are not a\r\nwine-drinking people, have prevented the building up of a wine industry\r\nas it exists in other grape-growing countries.\r\n\r\nAlthough the United States stands second or third in the list of\r\ngrape-producing countries it took lowest rank in wine production in\r\n1900, falling below the small countries of Greece and Switzerland and\r\nsuch comparatively undeveloped countries as Chili and Argentine. Since\r\nby far the greater proportion of American wines come from the European\r\ngrapes of the Pacific coast, it can be seen that wine made from American\r\ngrapes is but a drop in the bucket in the world's production. Reliable\r\nstatistics of viticulture in the United States were not taken until\r\n1890, but careful estimates, as we have seen, had been made by several\r\nmen at different periods. These with the last two census reports show\r\nthe output of wine in this country to be, in round numbers, as follows:\r\n\r\n               Gallons\r\n  1850          250,000\r\n  1860          500,000\r\n  1870        5,000,000\r\n  1880       15,000,000\r\n  1890       24,000,000\r\n  1900       30,000,000\r\n            ============\r\n\r\nAccording to the _American Wine Press_,[87] the leading authority on\r\nwines in this country, the vintage of 1907 shows the following figures:\r\n\r\n                             Gallons\r\n  Southern States          1,000,000\r\n  New Jersey                 250,000\r\n  New York                 4,000,000\r\n  Ohio                     2,500,000\r\n  Missouri                 1,500,000\r\n  California, dry         30,000,000\r\n  California, sweet       10,000,000\r\n  Western States             500,000\r\n  All other States           500,000\r\n                         ------------\r\n    Total wine yield      50,250,000\r\n                         ============\r\n\r\nSubtracting the product of California from the total we have\r\napproximately the yield of wine from native grapes.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of champagne[88] from native grapes is beginning to be\r\nan important adjunct to grape-growing and is of especial importance in\r\nNew York which is the chief seat of the new industry. According to\r\nstatistics from the Bureau of Statistics of the Department of Commerce\r\nand Labor,[89] more than two million bottles of genuine champagne wine\r\nare now produced annually in the United States. The figures compiled by\r\nthe Bureau of Statistics show that the manufacture of champagne has\r\nquadrupled in ten years and that New York is by far the largest producer\r\nin this class of wines. It is held by the writers of the circular quoted\r\nabove, and a careful study seems to have been made of the subject, that\r\nthe American product compares favorably with that produced in other\r\ncountries and that native champagnes are steadily improving with the\r\nincreased experience of the American producer.\r\n\r\nThe largest manufacturers of champagne are located about Keuka Lake,\r\nSteuben County, New York. About 75 per ct. of the total output of the\r\ncountry is manufactured here. The process used is the French one of\r\nfermentation in the bottle and a number of distinct brands are made\r\nwhich in color, taste, sparkle and purity are rapidly approaching the\r\nhigh quality of the celebrated French champagnes. Considerable champagne\r\nis also made in Orange County in the southeastern part of New York, in\r\nNorthern Ohio, in Missouri, and a small amount from European grapes in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of unfermented grape juice[90] is becoming an industry\r\nin New York and promises to substantially increase the production of\r\ngrapes. Grape juice is what its name purports, the juice of the grape\r\nundiluted, unsweetened and unfermented. A good grade of grape juice\r\ncontains no preservatives, the necessity for such being removed in the\r\nprocess of making, the chief operation of which is sterilization by heat\r\nwhereby the germs of fermentation are killed. The product is an ancient\r\none, as the Greeks, Hebrews and Assyrians used it as new wine; but the\r\nprocess of making an unfermented grape juice that could be kept for an\r\nindefinite length of time is quite modern, and is the outcome of the\r\ndiscoveries of the last half century regarding the control of the agents\r\nof fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe grape juice industry of the country is largely confined to New York\r\nand to the Chautauqua grape belt in the western part of the State. About\r\none-fifth of the grape crop of this region was turned into grape juice\r\nin 1907. The output of the Chautauqua region is as follows: 1904,\r\n400,000 gallons; 1905, 600,000 gallons; 1906, 1,000,000 gallons; 1907,\r\n1,500,000 gallons. The Concord is used almost entirely in the\r\nmanufacture of grape juice though a few other dark-colored grapes make a\r\nvery good product. There is but little demand for a light-colored grape\r\njuice but some is made. Since the European grape does not make a good\r\nunfermented juice there is no fear among growers of native grapes of\r\ncompetition from California or Europe. The rapid growth which this\r\nindustry has made is most encouraging to grape-growers for it promises\r\nto furnish a permanent and profitable demand for good grapes.\r\n\r\nRaisins[91] are not made from American grapes.[92] So far no varieties\r\nof the native species have been developed with sufficient sugar and\r\nsolid contents to make a raisin acceptable to the markets. Even were\r\nthere varieties from which raisins could be made, it is very doubtful if\r\nthe climate of eastern America during picking and curing time is such\r\nthat raisins could be made in competition with the product of\r\nCalifornia, now the greatest of the world's raisin producing regions,\r\nwhere the climate is almost perfectly adapted to the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE VITICULTURE OF NEW YORK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the viticulture of eastern United States shows that the\r\nregions in which grapes have been most largely grown in the past have\r\ncome into prominence, had their day, and then suffered a decline. The\r\nreasons for the more or less temporary character of grape regions are\r\nbecoming more and more apparent as our knowledge of grape-growing\r\nincreases. The grape, more than most other domesticated plants, is\r\nprofoundly influenced by climate, soil, cultural treatment, and insect\r\nand fungus pests. In any region in which the grape succeeds at all well,\r\nconditions are more favorable at the start of the industry than later;\r\nthis is especially true as regards soils, and the insect and fungus\r\npests. In a discussion of any phase of grape culture, in a broad sense,\r\nthe conditions under which the fruit is grown must receive careful\r\nconsideration. We therefore include in this chapter a discussion of the\r\ncharacters which most strongly influence grapes in vine, fruit and\r\ngeneral adaptability; also a brief discussion of the regions in which\r\nnative grapes have been successfully grown in America; and, more\r\nparticularly, an account of the viticulture and the grape regions of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nIn their wild state the various species of native grapes seem adapted to\r\na great diversity of soils and conditions. But under successful\r\ncultivation varieties of the several species are confined to somewhat\r\nrestricted regions and even localities. Often a grape variety will\r\nsucceed on one shore of a lake or river and not on the other; on one\r\nslope of a hill but not another. It is difficult to point out the\r\ndeterminants of successful grape culture. Adaptability can be known\r\npositively in many cases only by trial; for neither conditions of soil,\r\nnor climate, nor lay of land determines with certainty the adaptability\r\nof a given locality. Oftentimes one variety of a species may not be\r\nsuccessful while another is completely so. Many varieties reach\r\nperfection in one region or locality but not in another though the\r\nconditions may seem very similar. So great is the influence of local\r\nenvironment, oftentimes, that a variety grown in one locality might not\r\nbe recognized as the same grape when produced under other conditions.\r\n\r\nThe chief natural factors which govern the distribution of varieties of\r\ngrapes are: Latitude and altitude; temperature of air and soil; water\r\nsupply; the chemical and physical properties of the soil; air currents;\r\nand insects and fungi.\r\n\r\nLatitude and altitude very largely determine the annual temperature, the\r\namount and intensity of sunlight, and the length of the growing\r\nseason--all very important factors in growing grapes. Species and\r\nvarieties of grapes are usually adapted to regions having about the same\r\nlatitude; northern types do not succeed in the South nor the reverse.\r\nLength of season has more to do with the adaptation of grapes than the\r\ndegree of heat or cold, for some southern sorts are hardy in vine in the\r\nNorth but the seasons in the northern latitude are not sufficiently long\r\nfor the fruit to mature. On the other hand, northern varieties mature\r\ntoo quickly in the South and pass through maturity to decay with too\r\ngreat rapidity. The metes and bounds of latitude are often set aside in\r\ngrape-growing by local modifications. Thus it often happens that valleys\r\nin regions not generally adapted to viticulture are so protected from\r\ncold winds, so open to sunshine, or are so free from fogs or frosts as\r\nto furnish ideal conditions for grape-growing.\r\n\r\nProbably the chief factor in determining the adaptability of a region to\r\ngrape culture is temperature. Each of the different species and\r\nvarieties of grapes requires a certain amount of warmth for its best\r\ndevelopment and can endure but a certain degree of cold. The temperature\r\nof a region is chiefly determined by latitude, altitude and proximity to\r\nlarge bodies of water, though variations in the surface of the country\r\nare often important modifying agents of temperature and especially\r\ninfluence spring and fall frosts.\r\n\r\nThe grape does best in an equable temperature and does not thrive in\r\nregions where there is a great daily range. Regions and seasons in which\r\nthe temperature is comparatively low in the growing months of May, June\r\nand July and high, with much sunshine, in the maturing months of August,\r\nSeptember and October, produce the best grapes in the latitude of New\r\nYork. An average of from 55° to 65° for the first named period and of\r\nfrom 65° to 75° for the second are ideal temperature conditions for the\r\ngrape.\r\n\r\nThis fruit is very sensitive to moisture conditions. Not only must the\r\ntotal rainfall for the year be taken into consideration but its\r\ndistribution throughout the seasons must be considered. The grape does\r\nbest with comparatively little rainfall. When the rainfall is the least\r\npossible amount for a good growth of vine the grape crop will be the\r\nlargest, of best quality and most free from fungi. Wet seasons, and\r\nespecially wetness during the months of maturing, are disastrous to both\r\nquantity and quality of grapes. Thus, in New York it is not possible,\r\nwith most varieties, to produce good grapes if the average is above six\r\ninches each for the three growing months and five inches each for the\r\nmaturing months. It is far better for the crop that it be as low as four\r\ninches for the first named period and two inches for the second period.\r\n\r\nSuperfluous moisture in the soil favors too great a growth of vine,\r\nchecks and weakens the root system, prevents proper setting of fruit,\r\nand favors fungi, but hinders the multiplication of phylloxera. In\r\nparticular, a comparatively dry soil is desirable for grapes because of\r\nits influence on the development of the root system. In dry soils large\r\nroot systems are developed in the search for the water that the plant\r\nmust have. When intense droughts occur plants that have stood in damp\r\nsoils have not sufficient roots to supply the necessary water to the\r\naerial parts and the vines suffer in consequence. Some species and\r\nvarieties are better fitted for withstanding an excess of moisture than\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe soil exercises a great influence in determining the suitability of a\r\nregion for viticulture. Several factors act as soil determinants: (1)\r\nFertility; (2) physical characters; (3) soil heat. It is necessary to\r\nstudy each species, and even their varieties, to discover their powers\r\nof adaptation to different soils and it is possible to indicate here the\r\ngood and bad qualities of soils only in the most general way. In the\r\ndiscussion of species and varieties the soil preferences of the\r\ndifferent botanical and horticultural groups will be stated more fully.\r\n\r\nGreat fertility, as a natural characteristic, is not necessary in grape\r\nregions. Fertilizers, and especially the use of stable manures and cover\r\ncrops, can be made to supply very largely a lack of fertility. Soils\r\nnaturally too rich produce an overdevelopment of vine. Some species, as\r\n_Vitis rupestris_, grow naturally in very poor soils, the habitat of the\r\nlatter being dry ravines and stony places having comparatively little\r\norganic matter. The varieties of _Vitis rupestris_ promise well for\r\nstocks upon which to grow other varieties in certain soils. In Europe\r\ncalcareous or limy soils are not considered well adapted to\r\ngrape-growing, but in America we often find very good vineyards on such\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nThe physical character of a soil has more to do with the welfare of the\r\ngrape than fertility. Sand and clay are the two distinct types of soils\r\nusually found in general agricultural regions. As one or the other\r\npredominates soils take their character. So far as growth alone is\r\nconcerned these two types of soil do not influence the vines much\r\ndifferently, but the fruit in quantity and quality is greatly influenced\r\nby them. According as to whether sand or clay is in excess a soil is\r\nloose or compact, retains or gives up water, and is warm or cool. A\r\ncompact soil is made so by an excess of clay or of very fine sand.\r\nGrapes require a light friable soil and compactness is often a serious\r\ndefect. Usually species and varieties with large, thick roots are better\r\nadapted to compact soils than those with small root systems, probably\r\nbecause the strong roots have greater penetrating power than the weak\r\nones. Lightness and permeability of the soil may be influenced by\r\nsubsoiling and through the use of stable manure and cover crops, but a\r\nhard soil is generally so ill adapted to grape-growing that this fruit\r\nshould not be planted on it.\r\n\r\nThe heat-retaining properties of a soil must always be taken into\r\naccount in growing grapes. The great preference which many varieties of\r\ngrapes show for sands, loams, shales and gravels, depends largely upon\r\nthe greater amount of heat found in such soils. In northern regions it\r\nis especially needful that the soil furnish an abundance of bottom heat\r\nfor the grape. The removal of an excess of moisture is helpful in\r\nregulating soil heat; and, other things being equal, a well-drained soil\r\nis warmest.\r\n\r\nGrapes grow more or less well in any soil adapted to fruit-growing. It\r\nis not true, even, that the grape is more particular as to soils than\r\nother fruits. But the necessity of having great quantity and high\r\nquality of fruit in profitable viticulture makes it very necessary to\r\ntake their preferences as to soil into strict account.\r\n\r\nAir currents are of minor importance compared with the other factors\r\ndiscussed yet are worthy of attention. They are chiefly of importance in\r\ngrape-growing in the suppression of fungi. It has long been noticed\r\nthat in regions where there are strong currents of air the dreaded\r\nblack-rot and the mildew are not nearly so harmful. Winds may be\r\nbeneficial, too, when they bring warm air, when moisture laden, when\r\nthey keep frosty air in motion, and possibly they have an effect on some\r\nsmall insects as the leaf-hopper. On the contrary they may be\r\ndetrimental when too dry, strong or cold. Natural or artificial\r\nwindbreaks may greatly modify the effects of wind currents though their\r\nvalue is usually overestimated as their benefits are often offset by the\r\nundesirable conditions caused.\r\n\r\nLastly, the prevalence or lack of insects and fungi in a region may\r\ndecide its value for viticulture. In several instances flourishing\r\nviticultural industries have been destroyed in this country by insects\r\nor fungi, or both. In other regions the present supremacy of commercial\r\ngrape-growing is almost wholly due to the fact that neither insects nor\r\nfungi are seriously troublesome. The advent of spraying and a better\r\nknowledge of the life histories of insects and fungi are lessening the\r\nimportance of the parasite factor in determining the value of a region\r\nfor grape-growing, but it is still of high importance.\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared to take up a discussion of the grape regions of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nThe states in which the growing of American grapes takes the rank of an\r\nindustry are, according to the census of 1900, in order of production:\r\nNew York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,\r\nMissouri, Georgia and Oklahoma. The value of the product in the leading\r\nstate was $2,763,711; in the last named state, $128,500. American\r\nviticulture, so far as native grapes are concerned, is almost wholly\r\nconfined to twelve states. But viticultural interests are still further\r\nlocalized. In New York the industry is divided into four great regions,\r\nthe Chautauqua district, the Central Lakes district, the Hudson\r\ndistrict, and the Niagara district. In Pennsylvania and Ohio\r\ngrape-growing is largely confined to the shores of Lake Erie; in\r\nMichigan to a small district about the towns of Lawton and Paw Paw; in\r\nMissouri, Hermann is the representative point for grape culture.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHAUTAUQUA DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nOf the four grape regions of New York the Chautauqua district is by far\r\nthe most important though, excepting the Niagara, the most recent in\r\ndevelopment. The Chautauqua grape belt lies along the southeastern shore\r\nof Lake Erie. It averages about three miles in width and is about fifty\r\nmiles long. Its northeastern boundary is in Erie County but not far from\r\nthe line dividing Erie and Chautauqua Counties; its western boundary, in\r\nNew York, is the Pennsylvania line, an arbitrary division, for the\r\ndistrict passes into Pennsylvania. This narrow belt passes through the\r\ntowns of Hanover, Sheridan, Dunkirk, Pomfret, Portland, Westfield and\r\nRipley in Chautauqua County. Not all, but much, of the land is suitable\r\nfor grape-growing.\r\n\r\nThe topography, geology, and soils of this grape-belt have been\r\ncarefully mapped and studied.[93][94]\r\n\r\nThe grape land is, as we have seen, a narrow strip of comparatively low\r\nland which borders the shore of Lake Erie. On the southern boundary of\r\nthis low plain is a high hill or escarpment parallel to the lake and\r\nsurmounting the grape belt throughout its entire length. This\r\nescarpment, the \"Hill\", ranges from 500 to 700 feet above the plain and\r\nfrom 500 to 1000 feet above the lake. The plain is gently rolling and\r\nascends from the bluff of the lake to the escarpment with a grade of\r\nfrom one to two hundred feet to the mile, forming in some places\r\nwell-marked foot-hills to the escarpment proper.\r\n\r\nThe bed rock, according to Tarr[95] is upper Devonian shales and sand\r\nstones in both plain and escarpment. On the face of the escarpment and\r\non the table lands of some of the foot-hills the soil is so thin that\r\nthe plough frequently touches bed rock. This seldom comes to the surface\r\non the plain except in stream beds and in shale ridges, but is to be\r\nfound in fragments of greater or less size and in more or less abundance\r\nthroughout the soils of the entire district. Everywhere on the plain may\r\nbe seen ancient beach lines. These rise usually in two well-defined\r\nterraces but not infrequently there are from two to five distinct\r\nterraces between the lake and the escarpment. All conditions point to\r\nthe theory that these ridges are wave built and therefore of lake\r\norigin. The plain, the gravel ridges, the foot-hills and the high\r\nescarpment are the chief topographical features of the grape belt.\r\n\r\nThe grape soils of the district, as mapped by the Bureau of Soils of the\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture,[96] are Dunkirk clay, Dunkirk\r\ngravel, Dunkirk gravelly loam, Dunkirk sandy loam and Dunkirk shale\r\nloam. The grapes grown upon the several soils vary somewhat as to\r\nquantity per acre, as to flavor and sugar content and as to shipping\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nThe largest areas of Dunkirk clay are found running back from the lake\r\neast and west from Barcelona, in the neighborhood of Van Buren Point and\r\nabout Dunkirk. In these regions the soil is a clay loam from several\r\ninches to a foot deep resting upon a stiffer and more tenacious clay.\r\nVineyards located on this soil are very productive but the quality is\r\nnot as high as in the fruit grown on the shale loam, though for most\r\npart superior to that produced on the gravel and sandy loams.\r\n\r\nDunkirk gravel soils are found on the ridges at the foot of the\r\nescarpment on the southern boundary of the district from Pennsylvania to\r\nthe eastern boundary of the grape district. Throughout most of this\r\ndistance there are from one to three parallel ridges varying from a few\r\nrods to a half mile in breadth; at many places the ridges run into each\r\nother or have been brought together by cultivation. It was upon this\r\ngravel that vines were first successfully grown. Grapes upon this soil\r\nripen a week or more earlier than upon other soils and these lands are\r\ntherefore largely planted with vineyards to supply the early market and\r\nthey have a larger proportion of early varieties than vineyards on other\r\nsoils. The Niagara is thought to do especially well on Dunkirk gravel.\r\n\r\nDunkirk gravelly loam is found running through practically the whole\r\ngrape belt at the base or on the top of the gravel ridges; if at the\r\nbase, to lakeward of the ridges. It is a sandy loam with much fine\r\ngravel and is underlaid at a depth of three feet with sand and shale\r\nfragments. On the surface it much resembles the gravel soils having had\r\nconsiderable top gravel brought there by washing and by cultivation. The\r\ngrapes grown on these soils are very similar to those produced on the\r\ngravels though there are some minor differences. Some varieties produce\r\nlarger berries on this soil, and some sorts, it is claimed, a greater\r\namount of wood.\r\n\r\nThe Dunkirk sandy loams occur in large irregular areas bordering the\r\nlake or running from the lake bluff back to the escarpment. By far the\r\nlargest of these areas is found about Fredonia and Dunkirk and running\r\neast and west of these towns. A second area is found in the neighborhood\r\nof Brocton and Portland and especially to the north and west. There are\r\nsmaller areas east of Barcelona and northwest of Ripley. Nearly all of\r\nthe sandy loam soils are found on undulating or rolling land. The soil\r\nis a brownish-yellow loam from a half foot to a foot in depth. There are\r\nsome deviations from the type and yet the true sandy loams can be very\r\neasily recognized. The soil is of rather heavy texture making good\r\nfarming land and producing large crops of grapes of slightly inferior\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nThe Dunkirk shale loams are found upon the hill or escarpment. These\r\nform the grape lands farthest removed from the lake. This soil is\r\ncomparatively thin, not averaging more than a half-foot in depth and is\r\nhardly ever found a foot deep. It is brown in color with much coarse\r\nfragmentary shale on the surface and underlaid with a considerable body\r\nof heavy clay. Part of the shale loam land lies on slopes too steep and\r\nrough for cultivation but the hillside table lands of this soil are\r\nespecially well adapted to grape-growing. The grapes grown here contain\r\nmuch sugar, therefore keep and ship well, have a high flavor, and are\r\nespecially sought for in wine-making; grapes on these soils mature\r\nearly, have tough skins, but are only medium-sized berries. The yields\r\nare much more variable on this soil than on the others because of the\r\ngreat variation in the depth of soil. On deep soils of this loam the\r\nyield is all that could be desired. Because of the lay of the land, and\r\nthe nature of the soil, there is much washing and cultivation must be\r\ndone judiciously.\r\n\r\nThe climate is exceptionally favorable for the grape-grower in the\r\nChautauqua district. It is, if anything, of more importance than the\r\nland; for grape soils are not uncommon, but a grape climate as near\r\nperfection as that of this region is indeed rare. The influence of the\r\nlake in modifying the temperature of the region is the chief climatic\r\nfactor. This influence need not be dwelt upon here for it is common\r\nknowledge that large bodies of water temper cold winter weather, hold\r\nback vegetation in spring, equalize night and day temperatures of\r\nsummer, lengthen the growing season and ward off autumn frosts. Each of\r\nthese influences is highly favorable to the growth of the grape. The\r\nescarpment on the southeastern boundary of the belt has a most decided\r\ninfluence on the climate chiefly because it confines the influence of\r\nthe lake to a narrow belt. When the escarpment becomes low, as at the\r\ntwo extremities of the belt, grape-growing ceases to be profitable. When\r\nthe distance between the lake and the escarpment is great, the climatic\r\nconditions are not so favorable.\r\n\r\nThe air currents and rainfall of the region are especially favorable.\r\nThe in-shore breeze of the day and the off-shore breeze at night keep\r\nthe air in constant motion, thus preventing frosts in spring and autumn,\r\nand probably cause in part the great degree of immunity to black-rot and\r\nmildew. Unfortunately, data to determine accurately the rainfall of the\r\ndistrict cannot be had but such as have been taken indicate that the\r\nrainfall is comparatively light for the maturing months of August,\r\nSeptember and October and not heavy for the three preceding growing\r\nmonths. Residents of the grape belt claim that most of the heavy showers\r\npass over the hills or down the lake. The whole region is proverbially\r\nfree from heavy dews. Rain and dew are favorable to black-rot and other\r\nfungi and the lack of them still further accounts for the immunity to\r\nthese pests in the region.\r\n\r\nThe history of the rise of grape-growing in Chautauqua County forms an\r\ninteresting chapter in the economic development of New York. The first\r\nvines in the Chautauqua district were planted by Elijah Fay[97] in 1818,\r\nnear the present town of Brocton. These were wild vines of _Vitis\r\nlabrusca_ from Deacon Fay's boyhood home in New England. The vines grew\r\nluxuriantly but the fruit was not satisfactory and in 1822 this worthy\r\npioneer obtained at great trouble roots of Miller's Burgundy,\r\nSweetwater and Black Hamburg. But the second experiment was even more\r\ndisastrous than the first as he got no fruit. The real start was made in\r\n1824 when Mr. Fay obtained vines of Catawba and Isabella from Prince of\r\nFlushing, Long Island. The vines were trained on trellises. The vineyard\r\ncovered a plot two by eight rods in extent. From a rise of land near\r\nthis spot one now sees grapes everywhere, probably a greater acreage of\r\nthem than can be seen from any other spot east of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 Deacon Fay made ten gallons of wine, the first for the region.\r\nIn 1834, Lincoln Fay, a nephew of Elijah Fay, started the sale of grape\r\nvines but not many vines were sold for commercial plantings until as\r\nlate as 1850. In 1859 there were in the town of Portland but twenty\r\nacres of bearing grape vines where now are thousands. During the decade\r\nthat followed, the Concord was generally introduced giving the\r\nviticulture of the region a great impetus. Grapes were not yet grown for\r\ntable use to any great extent and a large acreage could not be used for\r\nwine-making. In 1859 a wine-cellar was built by Fay, Ryckman[98] and\r\nHaywood at Brocton and for a long while this company used almost the\r\ntotal crop of the region. It was not until the early seventies that the\r\ngrape-growers sought other markets than the wine-cellars. In 1870 there\r\nwere about 600 acres of vineyards in Chautauqua County.\r\n\r\nThe first table-grapes of the region were packed in twenty-pound splint\r\nbaskets. Dunkirk was the primary marketing place and the fruit was\r\nshipped from here to various large cities by through freight. The\r\ntransportation facilities were not satisfactory and in 1880 Jonas Martin\r\nof Brocton tried the experiment of shipping a carload of grapes to\r\nPhiladelphia. This was the first carload of grapes sent from Chautauqua\r\nCounty. In 1906, 4690 carloads were shipped and 844 were converted into\r\nwine and grape juice, representing all told $2,482,822.[99] Until 1883\r\nthe markets were confined to nearby cities but in this year a carload\r\nwas safely sent to Spokane, after which time markets were found from the\r\nAtlantic to the Pacific and from the Gulf to Upper Canada. The first\r\ngrape-growers' union was formed in 1886 as the Chautauqua Grape Growers'\r\nShipping Association and its organization marked a new epoch in the\r\ngrape industry of the district. Smaller and larger organizations have\r\nsince been formed and at the present time about 80 per ct. of the entire\r\ncrop is handled by a growers' union known as the Chautauqua and Erie\r\nGrape Company.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. G. E. Ryckman, in the early days of the grape industry\r\nin this region the fruit was shipped in round paper baskets holding from\r\nthree to five pounds; later these were made of wood. Sometime in the\r\nearly seventies twenty-pound splint baskets, which were supposed to be\r\nreturned to the owners, were introduced. These were superseded by the\r\ntwelve-pound climax basket; the size of this basket was soon reduced to\r\nten pounds, then to nine, then to eight. Meanwhile a small five-pound\r\nbasket made on the same lines as the larger one came into use but soon\r\nshrunk into a four-pound receptacle. The eight and the four-pound climax\r\nbaskets are now generally used throughout the region. Increasing\r\nquantities are now being shipped to large cities in trays with slatted\r\ntops holding about forty pounds each; these grapes are used by the\r\npurchaser for wine-making. The wine and grape juice industries of the\r\nregion have been touched upon in the general discussion of these\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nAn actual canvass made by this Station in the winter of 1906-7 shows\r\nthere are in the Chautauqua grape belt at this time 30,000 acres of\r\ngrapes. The census report of 1900 gave the number of vines for the\r\ncounty as 11,914,706, which at the usual number of vines per acre gives\r\nabout 20,000 acres for the district. This figure was probably low,\r\nthough that of the Station for 1907 may be somewhat high. The acreage is\r\ndistributed in towns approximately as follows: Portland 9500; Westfield\r\n5700; Ripley 5700; Pomfret 4600; Hanover 1950; Sheridan 1950; Dunkirk\r\n600. A correspondent writes that the grape shipments for 1907 indicate a\r\nconsiderably larger acreage for the towns of Hanover and Sheridan than\r\nare here given. The average yield of grapes is a little less than two\r\ntons per acre for the region. The value of vineyards varies from $100 to\r\n$400 per acre.\r\n\r\nThe crop for the past seven years calculated by _The Grape Belt_[100]\r\nfrom figures secured from the railroads are as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Season of 1900          8000 carloads\r\n  \"Season of 1901          6669 carloads\r\n  \"Season of 1902          5062 carloads\r\n  \"Season of 1903          2952 carloads\r\n  \"Season of 1904          7479 carloads\r\n  \"Season of 1905          5362 carloads\r\n  \"Season of 1906          5634 carloads\"\r\n\r\nThe seeming decrease in carloads shipped as the years progress is far\r\nmore than made up by the greater use of the fruit in local wineries and\r\ngrape juice factories.\r\n\r\nAccording to figures gathered in the preparation of this work about 90\r\nper ct. of the grape acreage of the region is set to Concord followed by\r\n3 per ct. of Niagara, 2 per ct. of Worden and 1 per ct. each for Moore\r\nEarly and Catawba with the remaining 3 per ct. made up of a dozen or\r\nmore sorts among which Delaware leads.\r\n\r\nThe shipping season in this district begins early in September and lasts\r\nwell into November though late varieties, as Catawba, and small lots of\r\nConcord are held some weeks longer. Improved storage facilities are\r\nyearly lengthening the season.\r\n\r\nSeveral systems of pruning and training are in vogue in the district but\r\nthe majority of the vineyards are pruned and trained in a system\r\npeculiar to Chautauqua County. The posts are from six to eight feet in\r\nheight, one to each three vines; two wires complete the trellis. The\r\nlower wire is from 28 to 32 inches from the ground and the second from\r\n22 to 36 inches above the first, the distance being changed as the vine\r\ncomes to maturity. The grapes are trained according to the upright\r\nsystem and the vines are renewed to short horizontal arms and but few\r\ncanes are taken out each year; the trunk reaches only to the lower wire.\r\nThe arms are loosely tied to the lower wire and the canes and bearing\r\nshoots to the wire above. Cultivation varies greatly but the best\r\ngrowers practice close cultivation and make use of fertilizers; the\r\ncover crop is growing in favor. Spraying is not very general as the\r\nregion has been remarkably free from pests. The chief insects now\r\nencountered are the grape-vine fidia,[101] the flea-beetle,[102] the\r\ngrape leaf-hopper[103] and the grape berry moth.[104] The several fungal\r\ndiseases found in this region are, about in order of importance,\r\nblack-rot, downy mildew, or \"brown-rot,\" powdery mildew, and\r\nanthracnose, or \"bird's-eye rot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTRAL LAKES DISTRICT\r\n\r\nSeveral important areas of vineyards are grouped about the central lakes\r\nin western New York. While there are at least three distinct localities\r\nin this district, namely, the areas about the three lakes, Keuka,\r\nCanandaigua, and Seneca, yet the soils, climate, varieties and methods\r\nof caring for vineyards and product are so nearly alike that all may be\r\ntreated as one district. The vineyards are in five counties, Ontario,\r\nYates, Schuyler, Steuben and Seneca. The Keuka area, in Yates and\r\nSteuben Counties, is by far the largest; and the region is often called\r\nthe Keuka grape district. Vineyards surround Keuka Lake and all but the\r\nnorthern end of Canandaigua Lake, but only on the banks of the southern\r\nhalf of Seneca Lake are grapes grown. The somewhat extensive vineyards\r\nabout Naples, south of Canandaigua Lake; Bath, south of Keuka Lake; and\r\nof Romulus between Seneca and Cayuga Lakes, belong in the Central Lakes\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe geology of the Central or Finger Lakes has been studied by many\r\nworkers and the geological history of these remarkable bodies of water\r\nis now well known.[105] It is very generally agreed that these lakes\r\nfill, in part, preglacial valleys and that the valleys were transformed\r\ninto lakes by glacial action. The basins of the lakes may have been and\r\nprobably were deepened by the erosive action of glaciers but it is\r\nfairly certain that there were pre-existing valleys which were dammed by\r\nglacial deposit.\r\n\r\nThe topography is more or less rough and broken. The steep hillsides of\r\nthe lakes were formed not only by erosion but by the tilting of the\r\nland. Beside these hillsides of the lakes to give character to the\r\ntopography of the region, there are ranges of hills and the remains of\r\nsome moraines, so that in general the land is very uneven. This is\r\nespecially true of the parts of it devoted to grape-growing though in\r\nsome grape sections there are many stretches of smooth and regular\r\nvineyards.\r\n\r\nThe soils of this great region vary much, as is always the case when\r\nland is made by glacial erosion and deposit of glacial drifts. On a\r\nsingle farm the soil may be thick and fertile in one part and thin and\r\npoor in another; it may consist largely of clay in one part and of sand\r\nand gravel in others. The grape soils in the Central Lakes region are,\r\nin particular, of miscellaneous types, embracing, in one place or\r\nanother, nearly all of the soils in the Dunkirk series described in the\r\ndiscussion of the Chautauqua district. Probably the Dunkirk clay loam,\r\noften very shaly and stony, is the most common of the several soils of\r\nthe region. There are also considerable areas of a shaly soil which\r\npossibly do not belong to the Dunkirk types, not having been influenced\r\nby water action as are true Dunkirk soils. On the slopes and hillsides\r\nthe land is sometimes rough and stony with but a thin covering of soil\r\nand with out-croppings of bed rock. The influence of the various soils\r\non the grape has not been studied as in the Chautauqua district but, as\r\nnoted, the soils in the two districts are in many cases similar so that\r\nthe discussion of the influence of the several types given for the\r\nChautauqua district will apply in large part to the Central Lakes\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe Central Lakes have a very perceptible influence on the climate of\r\nthe region. The lakes are deep and conserve warmth. The water of Seneca\r\nLake is so deep, and consequently warm, that it has been known to freeze\r\nover only a few times in the past hundred years. The winter climate in\r\nthis region is much less severe than in adjacent territories. Not only\r\ndoes the water modify the severity of the winter climate but the\r\nenclosing highlands materially assist in keeping in the warmth of the\r\nvalleys. Since the lakes run, generally speaking, north and south, the\r\nwinds are deflected to these directions very largely. In the summer,\r\nboth days and nights are cooler and the climate more equable near the\r\nlakes. These modifications of climate are all favorable to\r\ngrape-growing.\r\n\r\nThe first grapes grown in this district, so far as records show, were\r\nset by the Rev. William Bostwick at Hammondsport in 1830. The varieties\r\nwere Isabella and Catawba and these he succeeded in raising to\r\nperfection. From this time onward scattering vines were planted in\r\ngardens about the three lakes. About 1836 Mr. J. W. Prentiss, originator\r\nof the Prentiss grape, planted a small vineyard at Pulteney from which\r\nconsiderable fruit was sent to market from time to time and the vineyard\r\nwas constantly enlarged. In 1853 a commercial vineyard was set out by\r\nAndrew Reisinger, a German vine-dresser, consisting of two acres of\r\nIsabella and Catawba at Harmonyville in the town of Pulteney. Reisinger\r\ntrained, pruned and tilled his vines, operations unheard of before in\r\nthe district, and was rewarded with crops and profits which stimulated\r\ngrape culture in his and nearby neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 the Hon. Jacob Larrowe and Mr. Orlando Shephard planted small\r\nvineyards of Isabella and Catawba in Pleasant Valley near Hammondsport\r\nand were so successful that in 1858 their vineyards were greatly\r\nincreased and others in the valley embarked in the business of\r\nvine-culture. Viticulture was now fairly started and the industry grew\r\napace from 1858 onward. In 1860 two hundred acres of grapes were set in\r\nPleasant Valley alone and elsewhere on Keuka Lake large plantings were\r\nmade. Grapes brought from fifteen to thirty cents per pound and a\r\nbearing vineyard at this time was as good as a gold mine.\r\n\r\nPlantings were begun in the Yates County portion of the Keuka district\r\nin 1855 when Mr. W. W. Shirland set a small vineyard of Isabella in\r\nBenton township.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be no records as to the first plantings about Seneca and\r\nCanandaigua Lakes but all available information indicates that plantings\r\nabout these two lakes came in the spreading of the industry from Keuka\r\nLake. E. A. McKay of Naples seems to have had a vineyard of some extent\r\nas early as 1848 from which he sold fruit. There must have been\r\nvineyards of considerable size about Avon in Livingston County in the\r\nearly fifties; for Larrowe, Shephard and others obtained cuttings at\r\nthis place in 1855 for their vineyards in Pleasant Valley. Who owned\r\nthese Avon vineyards, and what their extent was, does not appear.\r\n\r\nThe first commercial shipment of any considerable amount beyond the\r\ntowns nearby was made in 1854 when Mr. J. W. Prentiss shipped a ton of\r\nIsabella packed in tubs to New York City. The tubs were made by cutting\r\napple barrels in half and were packed half full when a thin board\r\npartition was put in after which the tub was filled and covered. The\r\nconsignment reached the city in fair condition and brought fifteen cents\r\nper pound but a second ton shipped in the same way \"broke\" the market.\r\n\r\nJohn Mead of the town of Benton introduced the Concord in this region in\r\n1861 and the same year Henry Rose of Penn Yan set the first Delaware to\r\nbe planted commercially in the district. The Concord soon took the place\r\nof the Isabella but could not displace the Catawba as it did in the\r\nChautauqua district. The Delaware grew in favor and rapidly assumed\r\nthird place in the list of varieties about the three lakes, a position\r\nwhich it still maintains, though it is closely followed by the Niagara.\r\n\r\nBy 1860 grape-growing had become so general that the need of further\r\noutlets for the fruit was felt and the Pleasant Valley Wine Company was\r\nformed for the manufacture of wine and brandy. For several years\r\nfollowing, this company used about one-third of the output of Pleasant\r\nValley, helping very materially to steady the market for the whole\r\ndistrict. A few years later another large company, the Urbana Wine\r\nCompany, was formed; and when still later it was discovered that the\r\nchampagne made about Keuka Lake was superior to that made in any other\r\npart of America and that, with experience in making, it rivalled the\r\nchampagne in France, wine-making became an important adjunct to\r\ngrape-growing in this district. Now there are about twenty-five\r\ncompanies making wine and champagne on or near the shores of the three\r\nlakes, the industry having its center on Keuka Lake. Wine-making is\r\nstill in its infancy and because of the demand it creates for grapes,\r\nand the high prices paid by the wineries, will continue to exert a most\r\nfavorable influence on the viticulture of the district. There is but\r\nlittle unfermented grape juice made about the Central Lakes.\r\n\r\nA valuable asset of this district is its long range of season. Grapes\r\nripen from one to two weeks earlier about these lakes than they do in\r\nthe Chautauqua belt. Thus the Concords grown here are well out of the\r\nway of those grown in the Chautauqua district. The Catawba, which ripens\r\nlate and is a \"good keeper\", can be kept in fine condition until\r\nmidwinter or later. The range of season in this district, then, is from\r\nthe first part of September until February or even March.\r\n\r\nThough there have been grape-growers' unions for marketing the fruit of\r\nthis district at various times, most of it now goes through the hands of\r\nindividual buyers. An exception is the product of the large vineyards of\r\nNiagaras in Seneca County, the fruit of which is marketed with that of\r\nthe product of other Niagara vineyards of the Niagara district of\r\nwestern New York through a union of growers.\r\n\r\nThe grapes in this district are variously trained but the high renewal\r\nsystem is used chiefly. In this system the head of the trunk is from\r\ntwenty to thirty inches from the ground. Usually the trellis has three\r\nwires, the lowest about twenty inches from the ground and the others at\r\ndistances of eighteen inches apart. New canes are brought out from\r\nrenewal stubs and once in two or three years an attempt is made to bring\r\nthem directly from the head of the main trunk. This system is\r\nparticularly well adapted to the Catawba and Delaware so generally grown\r\nin the lake region. Thorough cultivation is practiced and the fall cover\r\ncrop of oats, barley or clover is coming into favor.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to ascertain the acreage in this district. Taking the\r\nfigures of the census of 1900 and those of a canvass made by this\r\nStation in the winter of 1906-7 the acreage in the several counties is\r\nabout as follows: Yates, 7940; Steuben, 5570; Ontario, 2630; Schuyler,\r\n1014; Seneca, 1540; total 18,694. These figures are slightly larger than\r\nthe estimates of grape-growers and buyers but chiefly so because they\r\ntake in scattered plantations throughout the several counties. Thus in\r\nall of these counties there are a surprisingly large number of Niagara\r\nvineyards in out-of-the-way places, set during the Niagara boom of the\r\neighties. To this Central Lakes district might also be added 500 acres\r\nof commercial vineyards in Livingston County; 250 in Cayuga and 250 in\r\nTompkins Counties. The total valuation of the crop in this district in\r\n1900 was $943,964.\r\n\r\nInsects are not as troublesome in the Central Lakes district as in the\r\nChautauqua district. The grape-vine fidia, or root-worm, one of the\r\nworst of the insect pests of the grape, is not yet destructive in this\r\nregion. The grape leaf-hopper and the grape-vine flea-beetle are\r\npossibly the worst of the insects infesting the grapes about these\r\nlakes.\r\n\r\nBut fungi are more troublesome than in the Chautauqua district; probably\r\nbecause the climatic conditions are more favorable to the development of\r\nthese pests about these smaller lakes than near Lake Erie. The five most\r\ntroublesome diseases, named about in order of importance are\r\nblack-rot,[106] downy mildew,[107] or \"brown-rot\", powdery mildew,[108]\r\nanthracnose,[109] or \"bird's-eye rot\" and chlorosis,[110] or\r\n\"yellow-leaf\". Vineyards are very generally sprayed in this district and\r\nusually with satisfactory results. Grape-growers have learned that\r\ncertain varieties are much more susceptible to some of the diseases than\r\nothers and plant accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUDSON RIVER DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nThe region along the Hudson River forms the third largest grape district\r\nin New York. According to the census of 1890 there were 13,000 acres of\r\ngrapes in this district but in 1900 the returns gave less than half that\r\nacreage. The great falling off was due to the taking out of a\r\nconsiderable number of old vineyards which had been planted with too\r\nmany varieties, or with worthless varieties, or in some other respect\r\nwere poorly set plantations. It is doubtful whether the acreage in 1907\r\nis greater than in 1900 but the industry is in a more healthful and\r\nprosperous condition now than then.\r\n\r\nAn estimate of the present acreage, and its distribution, made in the\r\npreparation of this work, gives the standing of the district as follows\r\nby counties: Columbia, 865 acres; Dutchess, 448 acres; Orange, 865\r\nacres; Ulster, 4021 acres; total, 6199 acres. Beside the above there\r\nare, of course, some scattering vineyards. There are only two or three\r\nwine-cellars in the district and probably 95 per ct. of the product of\r\nthe vineyards is sold for table grapes or to those who make wine in\r\nsmall quantities.\r\n\r\nThe grape lands of the Hudson River Valley are found very largely in the\r\ngeological division known as the Taconic Province.[111] This province is\r\na broad valley which extends from Pennsylvania across New Jersey, taking\r\nin Orange and parts of Ulster and Dutchess and Columbia Counties, then\r\npassing out of the State. The rocks in this geological division are\r\nshales, slates, schists, and limestones; and the soil is derived from\r\nthese rocks. The grape lands, for most part, are those in which there is\r\nmuch shale or slate and in more or less coarse fragments, the finer\r\nparticles being clay or gravelly loams. The district is more or less\r\nhilly, some of the vineyards being in valleys of a few acres extent,\r\nothers in broad, gently undulating plains and still others on\r\ncomparatively steep hillsides.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the Hudson Valley changes rapidly as one goes up the\r\nRiver because of the diversity of its physical features and the wide\r\nvariety of atmospheric influences to which it is subject. In the part of\r\nthe Valley in which grapes are grown the summer temperature is high\r\nowing to the position between ranges of mountains and to the southerly\r\nwinds which prevail at this season. In the winter the winds are\r\nnortherly and the temperature is often low making the culture of tender\r\ngrapes hazardous. The influence of the river, really a broad estuary in\r\nthe grape regions, at all seasons is most favorable for fruit-growing.\r\n\r\nThe lowlands of the Hudson Valley receive a somewhat small amount of\r\nrainfall as compared with the rest of New York because when moisture is\r\nbeing carried inland from the Atlantic it is largely precipitated by the\r\nmountains and highlands of New England. This is favorable to\r\ngrape-growing. Another desirable feature of the rainfall of this Valley\r\nis that the maximum summer downfall is in July whereas in many parts of\r\nthe State it is in September or October. This relatively light rainfall\r\nin the maturing months is more marked in this than in any other of the\r\ngrape districts of the State.\r\n\r\nThe recorded history of commercial viticulture dates back to 1827 when\r\nMr. Robert Underhill and his two sons, R. T. and W. A. Underhill,\r\nplanted a vineyard of Catawba and Isabella at Croton Point which\r\neventually covered seventy-five acres. For some years this vineyard\r\npractically supplied the large markets of the region with grapes. In\r\n1829, Rufus Barrett of New Paltz, began shipping Isabella grapes in\r\nsmall quantities to the New York market. Barrett lived in a settlement\r\nof French Huguenots, who after having experimented more or less with\r\nEuropean sorts, early in the nineteenth century began planting native\r\nvarieties. It is probable that Barrett obtained his inspiration for\r\nplanting and knowledge of vine-growing from these Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 a French vintner, John Jacques, set out a vineyard for\r\nwine-making at Washingtonville, Orange County. The varieties set were\r\nCatawba and Isabella, purchased from Prince of Long Island. Some of\r\nthese vines are still living, vigorous and thrifty at three score years\r\nand ten. The original plantation consisted of but a half acre but in\r\n1838 this was increased to ten acres. This is probably the oldest\r\nvineyard of native grapes in New York. The third year from the planting\r\nof this vineyard wine was made, and has been made at Washingtonville\r\never since, so that this community may claim the oldest winery as well\r\nas the oldest vineyard in the State.[112]\r\n\r\nWilliam T. Cornell planted a vineyard of Isabellas near Clintonville,\r\nUlster County, in the year 1845. Mrs. Cornell and Mrs. William A.\r\nUnderhill were sisters, so that Cornell's vines came from Croton Point.\r\nA. J. Caywood, of Marlboro, was a brother-in-law of Mr. Cornell. Thus\r\nthe inspiration of this noted viticulturist to plant grapes, and to\r\noriginate new sorts, may be traced directly back to the Frenchman,\r\nParmentier, who, as we have seen, furnished the Underhills with their\r\nvines and gave them instructions for their care. The Catawba and\r\nIsabella were grown almost entirely until the introduction of the\r\nDelaware and Concord, after which the first named sorts dropped out\r\nentirely, being subject to mildew and ripening late in the season.\r\n\r\nThe Valley of the Hudson has more reason to be called the birthplace of\r\nAmerican viticulture than any other of the grape-growing districts of\r\nthe country. The grape and wine industries, as we have seen, were early\r\nstarted here. Prince's Linnæan Garden at the mouth of the Valley was the\r\nfirst distributing agency for American grapes. Its owners did more than\r\ndistribute grapes, they distributed knowledge and trained men. A. J.\r\nCaywood of Marlboro, J. H. Ricketts of Newburgh, Stephen Underhill at\r\nCroton Point, Dr. A. K. Underhill at Charlton, Dr. C. W. Grant at Iona,\r\nW. D. Barns of Middlehope, Dr. William M. Culburt of Newburgh, were\r\nnotable early originators and experimenters with grapes and from their\r\nvineyards have come some of the best of our native varieties. Kniffin,\r\nthe Downings, and Buel are other familiar names in viticulture and\r\nhorticulture of those who lived on the Hudson and who have helped to\r\ninvest the region with sentiment and with interest for the grape grower.\r\n\r\nThe number of varieties grown in this region is far greater than in\r\nother parts of the State; as would be expected from its having been the\r\nbirthplace of so many and from its nearness to large markets where fancy\r\nsorts can be disposed of to advantage. The Concord leads in acreage\r\nfollowed in order of acreage by Delaware, Niagara, Worden, Moore Early,\r\nBacchus, Pocklington, Campbell Early, Hartford and Vergennes after which\r\ncome a great number of less well-known sorts grown in acre or less\r\nquantities. The value of the crop in this district in 1900 was $298,350.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of grape-growing along the Hudson the methods of\r\ntraining were essentially those used in Europe. The vines were kept well\r\nheaded back and were trained to stakes of varying heights. It did not\r\ntake long to discover that for our native grapes the vines must be so\r\ntrained as to give the fruit and foliage the greatest possible amount of\r\nsunshine; to regulate the bearing wood; to permit them to bear just so\r\nmuch and no more fruit; and to control the height of the main trunk.\r\nSoon distinctive systems for native grapes arose and one of the earliest\r\nof these originated with William Kniffin of Ulster County. This system\r\nstill bears his name and is most generally used either as it was first\r\npracticed or in some of its modifications. In the Kniffin system, and\r\nits modifications, the trunk is carried to the top wire and the bearing\r\nshoots are allowed to droop; for this reason this method of training is\r\noften called the _drooping_ system in contra-distinction to the upright\r\nsystems hitherto mentioned in which the bearing shoots are tied to wires\r\nabove the canes from which they grow. The Hudson Valley growers claim\r\nthat the Kniffin system is especially desirable for the strong growing\r\nsorts like Concord, Worden, and Niagara but admit that for the slender\r\nshorter growing kinds like Delaware and Catawba the upright system is\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nAs is always the case when fruit is grown near to the market in which it\r\nis sold, there is little uniformity in the packages in which it is\r\nshipped and the manner in which the fruit is packed. Most of the fruit\r\nfrom the vineyards along the Hudson goes to market in climax baskets of\r\nthe two standard sizes. Some of the growers pack two, or even three\r\nvarieties, in one package for the purpose of giving a range in color and\r\nquality. The shipping facilities along the river are unexcelled. Most of\r\nthe grapes go by boat down the Hudson to New York City. In this case the\r\nfruit is loaded late in the evening and reaches its destination early\r\nthe next morning. The rail connections to New England cities are good\r\nand large shipments go eastward by rail while smaller quantities go\r\ninland and south. The fruit is not marketed through unions nor has\r\nco-operative selling been tried, the nearness to market obviating the\r\nnecessity of co-operation.\r\n\r\nThe insect pests in this district are neither numerous nor particularly\r\ndestructive, the grape leaf-hopper and the grape-vine flea-beetle being\r\nmost common. Spraying for insects is not generally practiced. On the\r\nother hand the fungus troubles are serious, the black-rot having been\r\nespecially destructive in some sections. The other diseases are much the\r\nsame as in the districts discussed. While all of the fungi of the\r\ndistrict are amenable to treatment yet spraying has not been generally\r\npracticed nor have the vines been kept as vigorous and healthy through\r\ncultivation and fertilization as to withstand the attacks of the several\r\nfungi. The decreased acreage of grapes along the Hudson during the past\r\ndecade or two is due in some measure to the fact that the grape diseases\r\nhave not been controlled. With better knowledge of the life-habits of\r\nthe insects and fungi which attack vineyards, and means of combatting\r\nthese pests, viticulture should regain the prestige it once held in the\r\nHudson Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NIAGARA DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nThe Niagara district, the smallest of the several grape areas of the\r\nState, lies along the Niagara river and the southern shore of Lake\r\nOntario. In it are about 4700 acres distributed in counties as follows:\r\nErie, 2100; Niagara, 1250; Orleans, 375; Monroe, 700; Wayne, 380. In the\r\nsouthern part of Erie County the vineyards are grown under conditions\r\nvery similar to those we have described in the Chautauqua district; the\r\ntreatment given is much the same; the grapes are marketed as are those\r\nin the district to the south and west; and the Concord, as in the larger\r\ndistrict, is the variety most largely grown. But conditions in the\r\nnorthern and eastern part of the county more nearly approach those along\r\nNiagara river and the Ontario shore so that the county is included in\r\nthe Niagara district.\r\n\r\nIn Niagara, Orleans, Monroe, and Wayne Counties the grape lands are in\r\nwhat is known as the Ontario plain. This plain has for its western\r\nboundary in the United States, Niagara River; for its northern boundary\r\nLake Ontario; to the south there is a high escarpment, the Niagara\r\nescarpment, or \"the mountain\", separating the Ontario plain from the\r\nErie plain which is an eastward extension of the low plain on the south\r\nshore of Lake Erie. The Niagara escarpment may be seen well at Lewiston\r\nfrom which point it stretches eastward toward Lockport and westward into\r\nOntario. The escarpment may be traced to the eastern end of Lake Ontario\r\nwhere it disappears and the Erie and Ontario plains merge into one. In\r\nthe grape-growing counties the Ontario plain varies from four to nine\r\nmiles in width.\r\n\r\nThe plain is more or less rolling throughout its entire length; but in\r\nfew places are the hills too steep for fruit-growing. The soils are\r\nsandy, gravelly, or clay loams varying greatly in fertility and in\r\nadaptability for the grape. In parts of the district the soils are stony\r\nand shaly. They belong, so far as they have been studied, to the Dunkirk\r\nseries and are therefore quite similar to those of the Chautauqua\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe climate, too, is much like that of the Chautauqua district. The\r\naverage midwinter temperature is comparatively high; the summer\r\ntemperature is equable; and the precipitation of rain and dew light as\r\ncompared with inland areas. The influence of the escarpment is not so\r\nmarked in the Niagara district as in the Chautauqua belt. A remarkable\r\nfeature of the climate of this district is that killing frosts rarely\r\noccur before the close of October, giving a long maturing and harvesting\r\nseason for the grape. In the winter the daily range of temperature is\r\nsmall owing not only to the influence of the water but to the fact as\r\nwell that this season is a period of great cloudiness for the region.\r\n\r\nIn Erie County much of the product of the southern part is marketed with\r\nthat of Chautauqua County but to the north, Buffalo makes a splendid\r\nlocal market. Several varieties are grown for the home market but\r\nchiefly the Concord and the Niagara. These are packed in the various\r\nstyles of climax baskets and in slatted crates--the latter for the home\r\nmaking of wine. The fruit is carted to the market by the grower, or\r\npurchased in the field, in the case of wine-making, by the consumer.\r\n\r\nNiagara County is the home of the Niagara grape and this variety is\r\ngrown here almost exclusively. The product is sold very largely by the\r\ngrower in the open markets of Buffalo and Niagara Falls and is packed in\r\nthe several sizes of climax baskets. In the counties to the east of\r\nNiagara the product, almost exclusively Niagaras, is sold at Rochester\r\nor neighboring towns or shipped to the large eastern cities. Much of\r\nthis fruit is sold through the Niagara Grape Market Company, a\r\nco-operative union, with headquarters at Lockport, New York.\r\n\r\nThe Niagara region is the newest of the grape districts of the State.\r\nThere were few plantings along the shore of Ontario until 1886 when the\r\nNiagara grape was introduced and vineyards were put out in considerable\r\nnumbers throughout the whole extent of the district followed by still\r\nheavier plantings during the succeeding several years. It was soon\r\ndemonstrated that the region was well adapted to grape-growing and\r\nespecially for the Niagara grape but that there were many soils and\r\nlocations wholly unsuitable for vineyards. Consequently during the years\r\nthat followed the bearing of the first grapes, many vineyards have been\r\nabandoned so that there are now scarcely as many acres as at the close\r\nof the first period of expansion about 1900. The insect and fungus pests\r\nare much the same as in the Chautauqua district though the dreaded\r\ngrape-vine fidia is not yet nearly so common, but, on the other hand,\r\nthe black-rot is far more destructive, probably because the Niagara\r\ngrape is very susceptible to this fungus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSPECIES OF AMERICAN GRAPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENUS VITIS.\r\n\r\nThe genus Vitis was formed and named by Tournefort,[113] a French\r\nbotanist, more than two hundred years ago. In his work, _Institutiones\r\nRei Herbariae_, published in Paris in 1700, he gives the following\r\ndescription of this genus:\r\n\r\n\"The Vitis is a genus of plant with a (A) flower shaped like a rose,\r\nwith many petals placed uniformly in a circle, out of the middle of\r\nwhich arises the pistil (B), with stamens pressed together (C), the\r\nflower (D,E,F) folds upward; the pistil develops into an edible berry\r\n(E), fleshy, full of juice, and usually with four seeds (H,I), the seeds\r\nare pear-shaped (K).\"\r\n\r\nThe capital letters in the parentheses refer to illustrations. These\r\nindicate that Tournefort had a very clear conception of the flowering\r\nparts of a grape. He gives twenty-one species under this genus of which\r\nnine are American, one, however, being our Virginia creeper.\r\nTournefort's work is all very indefinite; others of the species than\r\nthose credited to America may be American, and it is quite possible that\r\nof the nine some would not be classed among the grapes to-day. Each\r\nspecies is credited to some previous botanist and it is evident that\r\nTournefort was a compiler rather than an original worker with grapes.\r\n\r\nThe next botanist who contributed to our knowledge of this genus was\r\nLinnaeus, the great Swedish systematist, who, in his _Genera Plantarum_,\r\n1754, gives the following description of the flower (Like Tournefort's,\r\nLinnaeus' book is written in Latin and the extracts here given are free\r\ntranslations):\r\n\r\n\"Calyx. Five-toothed, small.\r\n\r\n\"Corolla. Petals five, rudimentary, small, caducous.\r\n\r\n\"Stamens. Filaments five, subulate, erect, spreading, caducous, anthers\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\n\"Pistil. Ovary egg-shaped, style none, stigma obtuse headed.\r\n\r\n\"Pericarp. Berry nearly round, large, one cell.\r\n\r\n\"Seeds. Five, plump, terminate cordate, base contracted, partially\r\ndivided into two cells.\"\r\n\r\nLinnaeus in his _Species Plantarum_ of 1753, gives seven species as\r\nbelonging to this genus, three of which are credited to America. One,\r\nhowever, _Vitis arborea_, is not classed among the grapes by present-day\r\nbotanists.\r\n\r\nMarshall,[114] the first American botanist we have to consider, for\r\nneither Tournefort nor Linnaeus had ever been on this continent, in his\r\n_Arbustrum Americanum_, 1785, describes the genus Vitis in terms so\r\nnearly identical with those of Linnaeus as to lead one to suspect that\r\nit is merely a translation from the _Genera Plantarum_. Marshall gives\r\nfive species. One of these is certainly not a grape and one other is\r\nindeterminate.\r\n\r\nThomas Walter,[115] in his _Flora Caroliniana_, 1788, gives a brief\r\ndescription of the genus very similar to the foregoing but he also\r\nspeaks of the masculine and feminine forms of the flowers, a point that\r\ndoes not seem to have been noticed by any botanist of an earlier date.\r\nHe speaks of the corolla adhering at the top and coming off as a cap,\r\none of the distinguishing characters of Vitis. This latter point had,\r\nhowever, been noted by Tournefort, and his figures show that this is\r\nwhat he means when he speaks of the flower as folding upward.\r\nTournefort, however, seems to have been under the mistaken impression\r\nthat Ampelopsis (_Ampelopsis quinquifolia_ Michx. is our common American\r\nform) opens its flowers in the same way, as he includes this under\r\nVitis. Walter gives only three species and his descriptions of these are\r\nvery brief.\r\n\r\nThe first European botanist who made an extensive study of American\r\nplants in their habitats was André Michaux, a French botanist who\r\ntraveled extensively in North America at about the close of the\r\neighteenth century. In his _Flora Boreali-Americana_, which was\r\npublished in 1803, he gives a brief generic description of Vitis which\r\nincludes all of the essential characters given by Walter. He also\r\nquestions the male and female characters mentioned by Walter.[116]\r\nMichaux mentions five species of the American grapes. His descriptions\r\nare clear and every species described can readily be recognized so that\r\nthere is no question among botanists as to what species was meant in any\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nAn interesting contribution to our knowledge of the grapes of North\r\nAmerica is that of William Bartram.[117] Bartram's opportunities for\r\nbecoming familiar with these plants were probably greater than those of\r\nany other person of his day, he being a resident of America, and his\r\nfather having been a botanist, so that he was trained from childhood to\r\nobserve plants. The following is an extract from an article of Bartram's\r\nin the _Domestic Encyclopedia_, 1804:\r\n\r\n\"The most obvious characters which distinguish the grape vines of\r\nAmerica from those of the old continent are: 1. The berries of all the\r\nAmerican species and varieties that I have seen, approach the figure of\r\nan oblate spheroid; that is, the poles are flattened, and the transverse\r\ndiameter is longer than the polar: however, I have observed that\r\nAlexander's grape, and some of the _bul_ or bullet grapes, approach\r\nnearer to an oval or ellipsis which is the figure of all foreign or\r\nEuropean grapes that I have seen; viz. a prolate spheroid. 2. Most of\r\nthe American species and varieties have a glaucous and yellowish\r\npubescence on the under surface of their leaves. 3. All that I have\r\nobserved in the northern and eastern districts of the United States are\r\n_polygamous_; i. e. those vines which bear fruit (female) have\r\nhermaphrodite flowers (pentandria monogynia); but the males have only\r\nfive stamina, without any female organ, and are always barren. One\r\nshould suppose, from WALTER so strongly marking this character as to\r\ninduce him to place the Vitis in the class _Dioecia_, when Linnaeus and\r\nthe other European botanists had placed it in Pentandria (he himself\r\nbeing an European), that all the grape vines of the old continent are\r\nhermaphroditous and Pentandrian. I know not from my own observation,\r\nwhether the bull-grape of Carolina is hermaphroditous or dioecious, and\r\ntherefore rest satisfied with WALTER'S assertion.\" Bartram gives four\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nNuttall,[118] in his _Genera of North American Plants and Catalogue of\r\nthe Species_, gives a rather stereotyped description of the genus but in\r\naddition in fine type he gives the following:\r\n\r\n\"Leaf simple and cordate, angularly or sinuately lobed, rarely digitate\r\nor pinnate (Cissus?), flowers numerous, in compound racemes, not\r\nuncommonly producing 4, 6 and 7 petals, with a corresponding number of\r\nstamens, calix mostly entire, or obsoletely crenate, a glandulous disk\r\nsurrounding the germ; tendril dichotomous, sometimes producing flowers,\r\ntherefore analogous to a sterile raceme.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Nuttall was in doubt as to the distinguishing\r\ncharacters between Vitis and the allied genus, Cissus. While he has the\r\nspecies of the two genera in the same position they would now be placed,\r\nhis reference to pinnate-leaved species is somewhat misleading as no\r\npinnate-leaved species are known to-day in either Europe or America. He\r\nuses, however, the distinguishing character between these two genera\r\nthat we now accept, that is, Vitis has petals that adhere at the tops\r\nand come off in the form of a cap or calyptrum, while in Cissus the\r\ncorolla does not fall off as a cap. Nuttall mentions six species as\r\nbelonging to this genus: _Vitis labrusca_, _V. aestivalis_, _V.\r\ncordifolia_, _V. riparia_, _V. rotundifolia_, and _V. palmata_, with a\r\nquestion mark after the last species. None is described. His work is\r\napparently a discriminating compilation of the work of earlier\r\nbotanists.\r\n\r\nMany other botanical workers wrote on this genus during the period\r\ncovered and some of them did very valuable work in describing the\r\nvarious species but their work has not been referred to because it did\r\nnot add to the knowledge of the genus as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe first man to write a monograph on American grapes was\r\nRafinesque,[119] who published in 1830 a paper bound volume entitled\r\n_American Manual of the Grape Vine_, etc. Rafinesque, who was long a\r\nresident of the United States, had an opportunity to acquire knowledge\r\non the subject upon which he wrote second to none other. His description\r\nof the genus is similar to that of his predecessors and very good; but\r\nhere all similarity ends and practically all value. After having made\r\nforty-one species, the greater portion of which have names given by\r\nhimself, he says: \"By the above enumeration of our Grapes I have done\r\nfor this genus what Michaux did for our Oaks. Owing to the great\r\nconfusion of former authors, and the difficulty of comparing the leaves\r\nand fruits of all the species, it is hardly as perfect as I should wish.\r\nRigid botanists may perhaps wish to reduce this species to a minor\r\nnumber or consider some as hybrids: if they can find good permanent\r\ncollective characters, let them reduce our Grapes and Oaks to a dozen\r\nspecies. But the angular or striated branches, the long or short\r\npetioles, the oval, cordate or reniform leaves, etc., must always be\r\ndeemed essential specific characters, and several of my new species,\r\nsuch as V. bracteata, V. angulata, V. peltata, V. canina, V. blanda, V.\r\nlongifolia, V. acerifolia, V. amara, V. prolifera, etc., must be deemed\r\nvery distinct.\" None of those of which he says \"must be deemed essential\r\nspecific characters\" is now so considered and the species which must be\r\n\"deemed very distinct\" are many of them unrecognized and none of them\r\nknown by the name which he gave.\r\n\r\nLe Conte, about the middle of the last century, did much work in the\r\nbotany of grapes, publishing several papers in the _Proceedings of the\r\nAcademy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia_. These were in the nature\r\nof monographs although they were not, so far as known, published\r\nseparately. He gives twelve species generally taken from other authors.\r\n\r\nA little later than Le Conte, Engelmann of St. Louis, gave his attention\r\nto the genus Vitis, clearing up a number of disputed points. His work\r\nwas published in various reports and later in the _Bushberg Catalogue\r\nand Grape Manual_. Engelmann's studies are particularly valuable in that\r\nhe was the first botanist working with grapes who lived in the middle\r\nwest and the territory over which he ranged in his botanical expeditions\r\nwas comparatively virgin. This was about the time of the reconstitution\r\nof the French vineyards by the use of American roots as stocks on which\r\nto graft their French vines to enable them to resist phylloxera. Many\r\nthousand cuttings and rooted vines of American grapes were sent to\r\nFrance annually for this purpose. The value of grafting on resistant\r\nstocks had stimulated an interest among French scientists in grapes\r\ngenerally and particularly in the American species. While their aid in\r\nseparating species was but slight, owing to their distance from the\r\nfield where the plants were growing, yet the investigations of Planchon,\r\nMillardet, and others as to the comparative value of various characters\r\nin separating species, were of great importance. These investigations\r\nwere utilized by Engelmann to a considerable extent. Owing to its\r\nsimplicity, and somewhat perhaps to the place of publication, his work\r\nobtained favor among grape-growers to a greater extent than that of any\r\nof his predecessors. In his earlier writings he gives six species but in\r\nthe last edition of the _Bushberg Catalogue_ thirteen are enumerated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1. V. bicolor\r\n  2. V. cordifolia\r\n  3. V. rotundifolia\r\n  4. V. doaniana\r\n  5. V. longii\r\n  6. V. labrusca\r\n  7. V. rupestris\r\n  8. V. riparia\r\n  9. V. vinifera\r\n  10. V. aestivalis\r\n\r\nCANES OF SPECIES OF VITIS]\r\n\r\nShortly after and partly coincident with Engelmann, Munson, of Texas,\r\nmade valuable contributions to our knowledge of American grapes. Munson\r\nis, what none of his predecessors had been, a cultivator of grapes and a\r\nbreeder of new varieties as well as a botanical student of the subject.\r\nThe region in which he lived was comparatively new to botanists, and it\r\nwas partly, perhaps, on this account that he raised the number of\r\nspecies from the thirteen given by Engelmann to twenty-five. At the\r\npresent time it appears doubtful if all of these will ultimately be\r\ngiven specific rank. Many of them undoubtedly will, and others of them\r\nwill be recognized at least as varieties. Munson is regarded to-day as\r\nthe chief authority on grapes of the semi-arid and mountainous districts\r\nof the West and is one of the leading authorities on American\r\nviticulture.\r\n\r\nThe last man who has paid special attention to the grapes of North\r\nAmerica is Bailey, of Cornell. In his latest classification he gives\r\ntwenty-three species of American grapes. Bailey is the only American\r\nbotanist of experience and recognized standing in general botany who has\r\npaid special attention to the grape. His monograph of the genus Vitis\r\nwhich, with some changes, has appeared successively in _Gray's\r\nSynoptical Flora_, _The Evolution of Our Native Fruits_, and the\r\n_Cyclopedia of American Horticulture_, is the most complete work we have\r\non this subject. With his permission we have followed his arrangement of\r\nspecies in _The Grapes of New York_.\r\n\r\nWith this brief history of the formation of the genus Vitis as it now\r\nstands we pass to a consideration of the botanical characters of Vitis.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when botanists first commenced to work on the grape there\r\nhas been a constant search for taxonomic characters for separating the\r\nvarious species clearly and distinctly. Many of the earlier\r\ndescriptions, while they are correct so far as they go, do not mention\r\nenough characters to enable one to distinguish between similar species.\r\nIt has been found that dependence upon the shape of the leaf, size of\r\nberry, size of plant, date of ripening, and similar characters, is very\r\nuncertain and unsatisfactory and that, while these characters are always\r\nmentioned in descriptions as indicating the intrinsic value of a\r\nspecies, they are of little value from a systematic standpoint. There\r\nare, however, several characters of Vitis which have great taxonomic\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nOne of the fundamental characters which determine a species is\r\ncontinuous or intermittent tendrils, first noticed by Professor A.\r\nBraun[120] of Berlin. _Vitis labrusca_, the common Fox grape, is\r\npeculiar in that there are tendrils, or an inflorescence, opposite\r\nnearly every leaf; this arrangement is known as _continuous tendrils_.\r\nAll other species have two leaves with a tendril opposite each and a\r\nthird leaf without a tendril; such species are said to have\r\n_intermittent tendrils_. Continuity of tendrils is a variable character\r\nand to ascertain which of the two forms is present it is necessary to\r\nhave vigorous, healthy, typical canes. The lowest leaves of canes\r\nusually have no opposite tendrils. This character is shown in the\r\ncolor-plates of the several species.\r\n\r\nA closely related character is that of the number of inflorescences\r\nborne by a species. All species excepting _Vitis labrusca_ average two\r\ninflorescences to the cane but the last named species, at least in some\r\nof its subdivisions, may bear from three to six inflorescences, each of\r\ncourse in the place of a tendril opposite a leaf.\r\n\r\nProfessor Millardet of Bordeaux first called attention to the value of\r\nthat part of the cane known as the diaphragm as a means of\r\ndistinguishing species. The cane of the grape vine contains a large\r\npith, and in most species this pith is interrupted by woody tissue at\r\nthe joints; this woody tissue is the _diaphragm_. The presence or\r\nabsence of the diaphragm and its thickness are of taxonomic value. In\r\nRotundifolia, the southern Fox grape, the diaphragm is absent; in\r\nRiparia, the Riverbank grape, it is very thin; in Rupestris it is\r\nslightly thicker; while Cordifolia, Aestivalis, and Labrusca have thick\r\ndiaphragms. This character is studied best in the year-old canes of\r\nthe grape. The color-plate of canes shows the range in thickness of\r\ndiaphragms as they occur in several species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: V.

RIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEDS OF SPECIES OF VITIS\r\n\r\n[NATURAL SIZE AND ENLARGED]]\r\n\r\nThe time of flowering is of considerable value in distinguishing\r\nspecies. Unfortunately it requires live plants and a certain time of\r\nyear in order that this character be noted. The first American species\r\nto flower is Riparia. Rupestris flowers shortly after; next, Labrusca;\r\nAestivalis a little later, although the Lincecumii variety of Aestivalis\r\nblooms slightly before Labrusca; Cordifolia is very late in coming into\r\nbloom, and Cinerea still later. Vinifera, the European grape, blooms\r\nshortly after Labrusca. The cultivated offspring of all wild grapes\r\nretain the blooming characters of the species from which they are\r\nderived.\r\n\r\nOther characters that have been found of great value are those connected\r\nwith the seed. The ability to use the seed characters, however, cannot\r\nreadily be acquired except by the use of an illustrated manual and some\r\nexperience in selecting the seeds, as they are quite variable on the\r\nsame plant. The weight of the seeds differs in different species, but\r\nvaries so much inside the species that it is not of much value from a\r\nsystematic standpoint. In general, it may be said that the Labruscas\r\nhave the largest and heaviest seed of our American grapes; Riparia has\r\nthe smallest seed, with Aestivalis occupying an intermediate position.\r\nThe size of the seeds in Aestivalis, however, is more noticeable on\r\naccount of the small size of the fruit. The color-plate illustrates the\r\ndifferent characters to be found in grape seeds and a study of this\r\nplate with the technical descriptions of the several species will show\r\nhow important seeds become in classifying grapes.\r\n\r\nAttention is called to the characters given by Bartram as distinguishing\r\nthe European from the American species. The first difference that he\r\nmentions is in the shape of the fruit, that of the Vinifera being more\r\nor less oval and that of American species roundish or oblate. Recent\r\ntechnical descriptions of our American species give the fruit as\r\nspherical where the shape is mentioned at all. On the other hand it is\r\nknown that most of the cultivated varieties of European grapes are oval.\r\nDoes this mean that all of our cultivated American varieties which show\r\noval berries, such as Isabella, Catawba, and others, contain Vinifera\r\nblood? It could not be said without careful study that this is true but\r\nit is certainly worthy of consideration. This point seems to have\r\nescaped the attention of our later-day botanists.\r\n\r\nThe sexual status of the grape has always been a source of\r\nmisunderstanding. The earlier botanists spoke of American vines as\r\ndioecious, that is, bearing staminate and pistillate flowers on separate\r\nindividuals. In this, as was noted on page 98, they were corrected by\r\nBartram, in so far as American species were concerned, he stating that\r\nthe vines of America were polygamous (showing staminate and\r\nhermaphrodite plants). Bartram did not presume to speak as to the sex of\r\nthe flowers of the Old World grape. Later it was determined that the\r\ncultivated varieties of Europe were always hermaphrodite and that\r\nstaminate forms were unknown. Engelmann[121] explains this so well and\r\nwith such apparent satisfaction that we cannot do better than quote him\r\nhere. \"All the true Grape-vines bear fertile flowers on one stock and\r\nsterile flowers on another separate stock, and are therefore called\r\n_polygamous_, or, not quite correctly, _dioecious_. The sterile plants\r\ndo bear male flowers with abortive pistils, so that while they never\r\nproduce fruit themselves, they may assist in fertilizing the others; the\r\nfertile flowers, however, are hermaphrodites containing both\r\norgans--stamens and pistils--and are capable of ripening fruit without\r\nthe assistance of the male plants. Real female flowers without any\r\nstamens do not seem ever to have been observed. Both forms, the male and\r\nthe hermaphrodite, or if preferred those with sterile and those with\r\ncomplete flowers, are found mixed in their native localities of the wild\r\nplants, but of course only the fertile plants have been selected for\r\ncultivation, and thus it happens that to the cultivator only these are\r\nknown; and as the Grape-vine of the Old World has been in cultivation\r\nfor thousands of years, it has resulted that this hermaphrodite\r\ncharacter of its flowers has been mistaken for a botanical peculiarity,\r\nby which it was to be distinguished, not only from our American\r\nGrape-vines, but also from the wild grapes of the old world. But plants\r\nraised from the seeds of this as well as any other true Grape-vine,\r\ngenerally furnish as many sterile as fertile specimens, while those\r\npropagated by layering or by cuttings, of course, only continue the\r\nindividual character of the mother-plant or stock.\" The accompanying\r\nplate shows various forms of grape flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOWERS OF VITIS]\r\n\r\nHe further says in a foot-note: \"These fertile plants, however, are of\r\ntwo kinds; some are _perfect hermaphrodites_, with long and straight\r\nstamens around the pistil, the others bear smaller stamens, shorter than\r\nthe pistil which soon bend downward and curve under it; these may be\r\ncalled _imperfect hermaphrodites_, approaching females, and they do not\r\nseem to be as fruitful as the perfect hermaphrodites, unless otherwise\r\nfertilized.\"\r\n\r\nBeach[122] tested many of our cultivated varieties by sacking the\r\nclusters at blooming time and thus determined their capacity to\r\nfertilize themselves. From the data thus secured he divides them into\r\nfour classes: 1st. Those that are able to fertilize themselves so that\r\nthe clusters are perfect or varying from perfect to somewhat loose. 2d.\r\nThose in which the clusters are marketable, varying from moderately\r\ncompact to loose. 3d. Clusters so loose as to be unmarketable. 4th.\r\nThose which are self-sterile or showing no fruit on covered clusters. Of\r\n169 varieties tested, he found 38 belonging to the first class, 66 to\r\nthe second class, 28 to the third, and 37 to the fourth.\r\n\r\nLater it was found that the reason why certain varieties were\r\nself-sterile was on account of impotent and abortive pollen, the\r\npercentage of abortive pollen grains varying with different varieties\r\nand this percentage determining the degree of self-sterility. The\r\nupright or depressed stamen is not an invariable criterion of the\r\ncondition of the pollen although it is usually. There are a few\r\ninstances in which upright stamens bear impotent pollen but these are\r\nvery exceptional. Munson made similar tests of vines of twenty-two[123]\r\nAmerican species of vines secured from their habitats. In every case he\r\nfound that they showed only two forms, the staminate vines and the\r\nself-sterile hermaphrodite, no perfect hermaphrodites being found. While\r\nof some of the species the number of vines tested was a half dozen or\r\nless, in most instances many vines were tested from different places.\r\nThis is particularly interesting in that it becomes a puzzle as to where\r\nour perfectly hermaphrodite cultivated forms could have come from if\r\nsuch forms are not present in the wild vines of our woods and prairies.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the bark is an important distinguishing character for\r\nsome species; in particular as to whether it peels off and whether in\r\nlarge flakes or in narrow strips or shreds. So, too, the color of the\r\nbark is often of taxonomic importance. The form and color of the leaves\r\nare often considered, but these characters are variable and may be\r\nmisleading. The lobing of leaves is a fairly uniform character in most\r\nspecies, some having lobed and others having entire leaves. As to color\r\nand texture, the upper surface of the leaf in some species is smooth,\r\nglossy and shining and in others rough and dull with varying shades of\r\ngreen. The lower surfaces show similar variations with the addition of\r\nvarying conditions of pubescence and down or even of cobwebs. In young\r\nseedlings the shape and surfaces of the leaves are apt to be quite\r\ndifferent from those on the old plants, a character of systematic\r\nimportance with some species. The flower, as compared with this organ in\r\nother genera, is of little importance in distinguishing the species of\r\nVitis, there being an unusual similarity in the structure and appearance\r\nof the flowers of the several species.\r\n\r\nThe number of species of Vitis is very uncertain; as, indeed, is their\r\nhabitat, except that they are generally confined to the temperate or\r\nsubtropical regions. Some writers give the number as less than fifty but\r\nin all territories the number seems to depend on the thoroughness with\r\nwhich the region has been worked over botanically, and also on the\r\njudgment of the botanist doing the work. Gray recognized four species as\r\nbeing indigenous to America. Engelmann in his latest publication\r\n(_Bushberg Catalogue_, 1883), thirteen, while Munson gives twenty-five.\r\nBailey in _Gray's Synoptical Flora_, gives twenty-three species.\r\nPlanchon (in 1887) gives twenty-eight species for the world. Seventeen\r\nof these are credited to America, ten to Asia, and one, the Vinifera, of\r\nunknown nativity. All of these lists, however, are known to be\r\nincomplete. Bessey[124] says that the grape is not native to the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, and Planchon credits none to any section south of\r\nthe equator. Bailey credits two to Australia in a work not intended to\r\ncover more than those of American interest. And a correspondent[125]\r\nfrom that continent writes us giving a list of nineteen named and\r\nbotanically described species indigenous to Australia. The number of\r\nspecies of grapes in the world depends upon the arbitrary limits set for\r\na species and our knowledge of the genus is yet too meager to set these\r\nlimits with certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIES OF AMERICAN GRAPES.\r\n\r\nCONSPECTUS OF NORTH AMERICAN SPECIES OF VITIS.\r\n\r\nA.

(See Plate.)\r\n\r\nRotundifolia, or the southern Fox grape, seems to have attracted the\r\nattention of travelers in America from an early period. The references\r\nmade in the journals of the explorers of colonial times can frequently\r\nbe recognized as pertaining to this species. Rotundifolia seems to have\r\nescaped the attention of botanists, however, until the time of Michaux,\r\nwho named and described it. Possibly the reason for its being overlooked\r\nwas because of the supposition that this was the species Linnaeus had\r\ndescribed under the name Vulpina.[127] The uncertainty as to who first\r\ndescribed Rotundifolia created a confusion that was not definitely\r\ncleared up for nearly a hundred years and was responsible for the fact\r\nthat half the botanists called it _Vitis rotundifolia_ and a nearly\r\nequal number _Vitis vulpina_. Rafinesque, in 1830, described some three\r\nor four species within the bounds of what is now known as _Vitis\r\nrotundifolia_. None of these, however, has been accepted by later\r\nbotanists.\r\n\r\nThe habitat of this species is southern Delaware, west through\r\nTennessee, southern Illinois, southeastern Missouri, Arkansas (except\r\nthe northwestern portions), to Grayson County, Texas, as a northern and\r\nwestern boundary, to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf on the east and\r\nsouth. It becomes rare as one approaches the western limit but is common\r\nin many sections of the great region outlined above, being most abundant\r\non sandy, well-drained bottom lands and along river banks and in swamps,\r\nthick woodlands and thickets.\r\n\r\n_Vitis rotundifolia_ has for years been the favorite grape in many\r\nsections of the South. This is largely due, no doubt, to the fact that\r\nthey have been usually compared with Labrusca or Labrusca-Vinifera\r\nvarieties of northern origin which are not well adapted to southern\r\nconditions. With the introduction of native varieties of \"bunch\r\ngrapes\"[128] of merit, the southern species may lose in popularity. It\r\nmust be said, considering the fact that southern agricultural literature\r\nhas been filled with recommendations of Rotundifolia grapes for nearly a\r\ncentury, that the cultivation of varieties of this species is\r\ncomparatively limited.\r\n\r\nThe climate most suitable for Rotundifolia is that in which cotton grows\r\nand it thrives best in the lower portions of the cotton belt of the\r\nUnited States. On account of the late ripening of the fruit it requires\r\na long season. Vines of Rotundifolia have been known to withstand a\r\nwinter temperature as low as 12 degrees below zero, but under ordinary\r\nconditions this would undoubtedly be much too severe for most\r\nRotundifolias. They do not suffer from the effects of hot summers but\r\nwill not withstand drouth and are not well adapted to semi-arid\r\nconditions. All growers of varieties of this species agree that it does\r\nbest on light sandy or alluvial soils; and while it may grow on rather\r\nheavy clays, if all other conditions are favorable, its vigor will be\r\nlessened.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of Rotundifolia is very characteristic. The skin is thick, has\r\na leathery appearance, adheres strongly to the underlying flesh, and is\r\nmarked with lenticel-like russet dots. The flesh is more or less tough\r\nbut the toughness is not localized around the seed as in the case of\r\nLabrusca. The fruit and must of all the varieties of the species are\r\ncharacterized by a strong, musky aroma and are lacking in sugar and\r\nacid. Some varieties yield over four gallons of must per bushel.\r\nWine-makers are divided in opinion as to its value for wine-making, but\r\nat present the most promising outlook for Rotundifolia varieties is as\r\nwine grapes. Rotundifolia does not produce fruit suitable for the table\r\nchiefly because the berries ripen unevenly and when ripe drop from the\r\ncluster. The common method of gathering the fruit of this species is to\r\nshake the vines at intervals so that the ripe berries will drop on\r\nsheets spread below the vines. The juice which exudes from the point\r\nwhere the stem is broken off causes the berries to become smeared and\r\ngives them an unattractive appearance. Owing, however, to the tough\r\nskin, the berries do not crack as badly as other grapes would under the\r\nsame conditions but still they are not adapted to long distance\r\nshipments.\r\n\r\nUnder reasonably favorable conditions the vines attain great age and\r\ngreat size, and when grown on arbors, as they usually are, and without\r\npruning, they cover a large area. The vines are planted from fifteen to\r\nforty feet apart in the vineyard, and the first year or two are trained\r\nto posts. Later the tops of these posts are connected by cross-bars and\r\nan arbor is thus formed. Pruning usually consists of removing dead wood\r\nbut a few growers have always taken exception to the customary\r\nnon-pruning method of treating the Rotundifolia. Lately Newman, of\r\nSouth Carolina, has published a bulletin[129] in which he recommends\r\nthat the vines be pruned and raised on a trellis as is customary with\r\nother grapes. He gives figures to show that the damage to Rotundifolia\r\nvines is due to the bleeding that follows pruning and that this bleeding\r\nmay be obviated by pruning in the fall or early winter. The success of\r\nsuch a practice would undoubtedly place the culture of Rotundifolia\r\nvarieties on a better commercial footing.\r\n\r\nRotundifolia is remarkably resistant to the attacks of all insects and\r\nto fungal diseases. The phylloxera do not attack its roots and it is\r\nconsidered as resistant as any other, if not the most resistant of all\r\nAmerican species. It is grown from cuttings only with difficulty.\r\nHowever, under favorable circumstances, and with skilful handling, this\r\nis a successful method of propagation. Under unfavorable circumstances,\r\nor where only a few vines are desired, it is better to depend on layers.\r\nAs a stock upon which to graft other vines this species has not been a\r\nsuccess. Wylie found great difficulty in crossing Rotundifolia with\r\nother species, and the crosses did not thrive under cultivation. Lately\r\nMunson has introduced several Rotundifolia hybrids.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =VITIS MUNSONIANA= Simpson.\r\n\r\n     =1.= (?) Rafinesque, =1830=:17. V. PELTATA; _V.

Canes slightly angular; internodes short; tendrils\r\nintermittent, simple. Leaves smaller and thinner than Rotundifolia and\r\nrather more circular in outline; not lobed; teeth rather open and\r\nspreading; petiolar sinus V-shaped; both surfaces smooth, rather light\r\ngreen. Cluster with more berries but about the same size as\r\nRotundifolia. Berry one-third to one-half the diameter, with thinner and\r\nmore tender skin; black, shining; pulp less solid, more acid and\r\nwithout muskiness. Seeds about one-half the size of Rotundifolia,\r\nsimilar in other respects. Leafing, flowering, and ripening fruit very\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 Rafinesque described, under the name _Vitis peltata_, or _Vitis\r\nfloridana_, \"a very singular species, lately found in Florida.\" This\r\ndescription is brief and includes many characters of no taxonomic value.\r\nIn 1885 or 1886, Mr. J.H. Simpson of Manatee, Florida, sent a specimen\r\nof a grape growing in his locality to Munson which was taken to be\r\nRafinesque's _Vitis peltata_. He consequently described it under the\r\nname _Vitis floridana_ but the species was not generally accepted. Later\r\nSimpson gave it the name _Vitis munsoniana_.\r\n\r\nIts habitat is central and southern Florida and the Florida Keys, and it\r\nis said to be the only grape growing on these Keys. It extends south of\r\nthe habitat of Rotundifolia and blends into this species at their point\r\nof meeting.\r\n\r\nMunsoniana appears to be a variation of Rotundifolia, fitted to\r\nsubtropical conditions. It is tender, not enduring a lower temperature\r\nthan zero. In the matter of multiplication it differs from _Vitis\r\nrotundifolia_ in that it can be propagated readily from cuttings. Like\r\nRotundifolia it is resistant to phylloxera. The species is of no value\r\nhorticulturally.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =VITIS RUPESTRIS= Scheele.\r\n\r\n     =1.= Scheele, _Linn._, =21=:591. 1848. =2.= Ravenel, _U. S. Pat.\r\n     Off.

Diaphragm thin but slightly\r\n     thicker than Riparia; tendrils few, or, if present, weak, usually\r\n     deciduous. Leaves rather small; young leaves frequently folded on\r\n     midrib; broadly cordate or reniform, wider than long, scarcely ever\r\n     slightly lobed, smooth, glabrous on both surfaces at maturity;\r\n     petiolar sinus wide, shallow; margin rather coarsely toothed,\r\n     frequently a sharp abrupt point at terminal. Cluster small. Berries\r\n     small, usually larger than Riparia, color black or purple-black.\r\n     Seeds small, not notched; beak short, rather blunt; raphe slightly\r\n     distinct to indistinct, usually showing as a narrow groove; chalaza\r\n     of medium size, pear-shaped, sometimes distinct, but usually a\r\n     depression only. Leafing, blossoming, and ripening early\r\n     (blossoming soon after Riparia).\r\n\r\nRupestris seems to have been first described and named by Scheele in\r\n1848 in a contribution on the flora of Texas to the periodical\r\n_Linnaea_. Ravenel, in 1859, states that this grape is found in Texas\r\nand is there known as the Mountain grape. It was mentioned and described\r\nby Buckley, Engelmann, and all of the later botanists. (See Plate.)\r\n\r\nThis species is an inhabitant of southwestern Texas, extending eastward\r\nand northward into New Mexico, southern Missouri, Indiana and Tennessee\r\nto southern Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. Its favorite\r\nplaces are gravelly banks and bars of mountain streams or the rocky beds\r\nof dry water-courses. Rupestris is usually considered drouth-resistant\r\nbut Munson states that it is short-lived in the upland sandy soils in\r\nnorthern Texas, where, owing to long droughts, the land dries out\r\ndeeply. Here, he says, it is not so successfully resistant to drouth as\r\nLincecumii.[130]\r\n\r\nThis species is quite variable both in type and growth. It was\r\nintroduced into France at about the same time as Riparia, and the French\r\nvineyardists selected the most vigorous and healthy forms for grafting\r\nstock. These pass under the various names of Rupestris Mission,\r\nRupestris du Lot, Rupestris Ganzin, Rupestris Martin, Rupestris St.\r\nGeorge, and others. In France they are stated to have given particularly\r\ngood results on bare, rocky soils with hot, dry exposures. In\r\nCalifornia, Husmann[131] states, \"It does not flourish in dry locations\r\nhere, and as it suckers profusely and does not take the graft as readily\r\nas the two former classes [Riparia and Aestivalis], it is not largely\r\npropagated.\" It has not been sufficiently cultivated in this country\r\neast of the Rocky Mountains so that it can be said what conditions of\r\nsoil and climate best suit this species other than the general\r\nconclusions that may be drawn from the conditions present where the\r\nspecies is indigenous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUPESTRIS DU LOT]\r\n\r\nThe clusters of fruit are small, with berries about the size of a\r\ncurrant and varying from sweet to sour. The berry is characterized by\r\nmuch pigment under the skin. The fruit has a sprightly taste wholly free\r\nfrom any disagreeable foxiness. According to Munson, it is too\r\nunproductive to be profitable. The sugar and acid content of the must is\r\nnot known. Jaeger states that Rupestris wine sent to France was there\r\njudged as decidedly the best American claret yet tested.\r\n\r\nRupestris under cultivation is said to be very resistant to rot and\r\nmildew of the foliage. It is considered hardy by those familiar with it\r\nin the Southwest, and Campbell states that it withstood, without injury,\r\n32 degrees below zero at Delaware, Ohio. The attention of hybridizers\r\nwas attracted to this species over thirty years ago and various hybrids\r\nhave been produced by Jaeger, Munson, Campbell and Millardet, all of\r\nwhom considered Rupestris of great promise for grape-breeding. The root\r\nsystem of Rupestris is peculiar in that the roots penetrate at once\r\ndeeply into the ground instead of extending laterally as in other\r\nspecies. Like those of Riparia, the roots are slender, hard, and\r\nresistant to the phylloxera. The species is easily propagated by\r\ncuttings. According to Husmann[132] the vines bench-graft readily but\r\nare difficult to handle in field grafting.\r\n\r\n\r\n=VITIS RUPESTRIS DISSECTA= Eggert.\r\n\r\n     =1.= Bailey, _Gray's Syn.

Eggert of St. Louis, the name\r\nbeing placed on herbarium specimens but apparently not published by him.\r\nAccording to Bailey it differs from the typical forms of the species in\r\nhaving \"more ovate leaves and very long teeth, and a strong tendency\r\ntowards irregular lobing.\" It is found in Missouri.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =VITIS MONTICOLA= Buckley.[133]\r\n\r\n     =1.= Buckley, _Proc.

Canes very slender; shoots angled, more or less\r\n     pubescent; diaphragms medium to rather thin; tendrils medium in\r\n     size, intermittent, usually bifid, deciduous. Leaves with stipules\r\n     short, broad; leaf-blade small and thin, cordate, entire, notched\r\n     or shortly three-lobed; petiolar sinus rather deep and medium to\r\n     narrow in width, sometimes overlapping, rounded; margin broadly and\r\n     obtusely toothed; apex usually acuminate; upper surface smooth,\r\n     glossy; lower surface grayish-green, more or less pubescent when\r\n     young; pubescence confined chiefly to ribs and veins. Clusters\r\n     short and broad, compact, with medium to short peduncle. Berries\r\n     medium to below in size, black or gray with thin bloom. Seeds\r\n     large, usually slightly notched; chalaza rather narrow; raphe a\r\n     groove. Leafing, flowering, and ripening fruit very late.\r\n\r\n_Vitis monticola_ was named and described by Buckley in 1861. There\r\nseems to have been some misunderstanding by later botanists as to\r\nexactly what Buckley's species of this name is, and in spite of what has\r\nbeen written on the subject, it seems as though some of the botanists\r\nare still describing different species. The seed, in Engelmann's figure,\r\nresembles that of the Rupestris very closely, while as figured by Viala\r\nthe seeds resemble those of Cinerea or Cordifolia.\r\n\r\nMonticola inhabits the limestone hills of central and southwestern\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of this species has a very sweet and somewhat peculiar\r\nflavor. The vines can be propagated from cuttings only with difficulty.\r\nThe species is adapted to a hot, dry climate and limestone land. It is\r\nfound to be very resistant to phylloxera and is sometimes recommended as\r\na stock for Vinifera but is not generally considered as valuable in this\r\nrespect as Berlandieri. It is without value for its fruit and is of no\r\nhorticultural importance to the eastern American grape-grower.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. =VITIS RIPARIA=[134] Michx.\r\n\r\n     =1.= Tournefort, _Inst.

(See Plate.)\r\n\r\nThe first mention we have of _Vitis riparia_ is by Tournefort in 1700,\r\nwho, without further description, calls it _Vitis canadensis aceris\r\nfolio_, or Maple-leaved Canadian grape.[135] Linnaeus in 1753 described\r\nmixed specimens of Cordifolia and Riparia under the name of _Vitis\r\nvulpina_. His description is as follows:[136] \"Leaves cordate,\r\ndentate-serrate, glabrous on both sides.\" Walter and Willdenow copy the\r\ndescription of Linnaeus. The first description which is clear, and the\r\nidentity of which has never been questioned, is that of Michaux in 1803,\r\nunder the name Riparia. He says: \"Leaves unequally and sharply dentate,\r\nslightly 3-lobed. Petioles, veins and margins pubescent. Called by\r\nFrench residents _Vigne des battures_. Habitat along the banks and on\r\nthe islands of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, etc.\" Bartram, in 1804,\r\nunder the name of _Vitis serotina_, or Winter grape, describes a vine\r\nwhich may be Riparia or may be Cordifolia as it has some of the\r\ncharacters of both.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOOT OF _VITIS RIPARIA_]\r\n\r\nLinnaeus' description seems to have thoroughly confused all of the\r\nearlier botanists. They were in doubt, first, as to what species was\r\nintended for Vulpina; second, as to the distinguishing characters\r\nbetween Riparia and Cordifolia. Gray classed Riparia as a variety of\r\nCordifolia. Engelmann was the first to draw attention to the specific\r\ncharacters which separated these two sorts and these he gives as\r\nfollows: 1st. Riparia has thin diaphragms, Cordifolia thick. 2d. Riparia\r\nblooms early, Cordifolia late. 3d. Riparia propagates readily from\r\ncuttings, Cordifolia only with difficulty. 4th. Seeds of the Riparia\r\nhave indistinct or almost indistinct, depressed chalaza and raphe, while\r\nthe chalaza and raphe of the Cordifolia seeds are elevated and distinct.\r\nTo these Bush[137] added the further distinguishing character that on\r\nthe shoots the small terminal leaves of the Cordifolia open as soon as\r\nformed, while those of Riparia remain folded for some days after they\r\nare formed, become larger and then expand gradually.\r\n\r\nRiparia is the most widely distributed of any American species of grape.\r\nIt has been found in parts of Canada north of Quebec and from thence\r\nsouthward to the Gulf of Mexico. It is found from the Atlantic coast\r\nwestward, most botanists say to the Rocky Mountains, but Munson gives\r\nthe western limit as Salt Lake. Since Munson is more familiar with the\r\ndistrict lying west of the Rocky Mountains than any other botanist who\r\nhas paid attention to grapes, he is probably correct. Usually it is\r\nfound on river banks, on islands or in upland ravines.\r\n\r\nRiparia has always been considered of great promise in the evolution of\r\nAmerican grapes. It can hardly be said that it has fulfilled\r\nexpectations, there probably being no pure variety of this species of\r\nmore than local importance, and the results of hybridizing it with other\r\nspecies have not been wholly successful. The reason why attention was\r\nearly turned to Riparia was because of the qualities presented by the\r\nvine rather than those of the fruit, particularly its hardiness and\r\nvigor. However, both of these qualities are quite variable, and it is\r\nonly reasonable to suppose that in such a widely distributed species,\r\nplants found in a certain region would have adapted themselves to the\r\nconditions there present; thus it should be expected that the northern\r\nplants would be more hardy than those from the South and the western\r\nprairie forms more capable of resisting drouth than those from humid\r\nregions; this is found to be the case. It is consequently impossible to\r\nsay what conditions best suit this species; it may be said, however,\r\nthat it is adapted to a great variety of soils and locations; Riparia\r\nvines, or certain ones of them, have withstood a temperature of 40 to 60\r\ndegrees below zero and they show equal ability in withstanding the\r\ninjurious effects of high temperatures in the summer. On account of its\r\nhabit of early blooming, the blossoms sometimes suffer from late frosts\r\nin the spring.\r\n\r\nWhile Riparia is not a swamp grape and is not found growing under swampy\r\nconditions, it is fond of water. In the semi-arid regions always, and in\r\nhumid regions usually, it is found growing along the banks of streams,\r\nin ravines, on the islands of rivers, and in wet places. It is not\r\nnearly so capable of withstanding drouth as Rupestris. Riparia likes a\r\nrather rich soil but in France has been found to do poorly on limestone\r\nland and calcareous marls. The French tell us, however, that this is a\r\ncharacteristic of all our American grapes and that the Riparia is more\r\nresistant to the injurious effects of an excess of lime than either\r\nRupestris or Aestivalis.\r\n\r\nAs was noted in the botanical description, the fruit of Riparia is\r\nusually small, there being occasional varieties of medium size or\r\nslightly above. The clusters are of medium size and, if judged from the\r\nstandpoint of number of berries, might frequently be called large. The\r\nflavor is usually sharply acid but free from foxiness or any\r\ndisagreeable wild taste. If eaten in quantity, the acidity is apt to\r\naffect the lips and end of the tongue. When the acidity is somewhat\r\nameliorated, as in the case of thoroughly ripe or even overripe and\r\nshriveled fruit, the flavor is much liked by many people. The flesh is\r\nneither pulpy nor solid and dissolves in the mouth and separates readily\r\nfrom the seed. The must of Riparia is characterized by an average amount\r\nof sugar, varying considerably in the fruit from different vines, and by\r\nan excess of acid. There is no disagreeable aroma, or foxiness, in the\r\njuice of this species, but the wines made from pure must of Riparia\r\ngrapes, unless kept for a long time, or otherwise treated, are too sour.\r\nOn this account many recommend adding sugar and water to the must to\r\nreduce the percentage of acid.\r\n\r\nRiparia is very resistant to phylloxera, the roots are small in size,\r\nhard and numerous and branch freely. The roots feed close to the surface\r\nand do not seem to be well adapted to forcing their way through heavy\r\nclays or a hardpan formation; but as such soils are unfavorable for all\r\ngrapes, this character is of little economic importance. Riparia grows\r\nreadily from cuttings and makes a good stock for grafting, and its union\r\nwith other species is usually permanent. At the time when Riparias were\r\nfirst sent to France to be used as a stock in reconstituting the French\r\nvineyards, it was found that many of the vines secured from the woods\r\nwere of too weak growth to support the stronger-growing Viniferas. On\r\nthis account the French growers selected the more vigorous forms of the\r\nRiparias sent them to which they gave varietal names, as Riparia Gloire,\r\nRiparia Grand Glabre, Riparia Scribner, Riparia Martin and others. With\r\nthese selected Riparias the graft does not outgrow the stock. Riparia is\r\nless resistant to rot than Aestivalis but somewhat more resistant than\r\nLabrusca. The foliage is rarely attacked by mildew. One of the chief\r\nfailings of this species is the susceptibility of the leaves to the\r\nattack of the leaf-hopper. This defect is quite serious in some\r\ngrape-growing regions. The Riparias are generally late in ripening and\r\nit is found that the fruit is better in quality in long seasons and that\r\nit should be left on the vines as late as possible. There are some early\r\nripening varieties of this species, however.\r\n\r\n\r\n=VITIS RIPARIA PRÆCOX= Engelmann.\r\n\r\n     =1.= Price, =1830=:194. V.

In 1872 Engelmann\r\nrefers to it, saying that it grows on rocky river banks in the vicinity\r\nof St. Louis and that it is brought to market in July. He says further\r\nin the _Bushberg Catalogue_ that from the first of July on, ripe fruit\r\nis to be found through August and September. Bailey states in the\r\n_American Gardening_ that Engelmann in his herbarium had given this\r\nvariety the name _præcox_ but did not know whether it had been published\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nThe variety differs from the typical form of Riparia only in the\r\nripening season and possibly in the berries averaging smaller. The early\r\nripening season might make it of horticultural importance as a breeding\r\nstock although in other respects the fruit characters are not such as\r\nwould recommend it.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. =VITIS TRELEASEI= Munson.[138]\r\n\r\n     =1.= Bailey, _Gray's Syn.

Its leaves are\r\nfrequently pubescent beneath. Another form with dentate margin of leaf\r\nhas been known under the name of Nuevo Mexicana or Novo Mexicana. The\r\nreferences to these two forms are inextricably confused. Engelmann\r\nrefers to this grape which he says he found growing in the botanic\r\ngarden of Berlin under the name of _Vitis solonis_. After careful\r\ninvestigation he decided that this name was a corruption of _Vitis\r\nlongii_, or Long's grape, which had been brought from the headwaters of\r\nthe Arkansas river by Major Long's expedition into that then unknown\r\ncountry in the early part of the last century. Many botanists consider\r\nthis a hybrid of two or more other species, Riparia, Rupestris,\r\nCandicans and Cordifolia being offered as probable parents.\r\n\r\nIts habitat is northern Texas \"westward into New Mexico, eastward into\r\nOklahoma and northward into Kansas and southeastern Colorado.\"\r\n\r\n_Vitis longii_ was first described by Prince in 1830.

Shoots\r\n     thinly pubescent, somewhat angled, generally cylindrical when\r\n     mature; diaphragms thin; tendrils intermittent, strong, bifid or\r\n     trifid. Leaves small to rather large, slightly reniform or broadly\r\n     cordate, usually entire but frequently shortly three-lobed;\r\n     petiolar sinus wide to medium; dark green, glabrous above with thin\r\n     cobwebby tomentum below, becoming more or less glabrous when\r\n     mature. Clusters of small or medium size; peduncle medium in\r\n     length. Berries large, black, slight if any bloom, very persistent,\r\n     of sweet flavor and tender pulp. Seeds closely resembling\r\n     Candicans. Blooms just before Labrusca. Variable in ripening\r\n     season.\r\n\r\nChampini was named and described in 1882 by Planchon. He states that it\r\nis probably a hybrid between _Vitis candicans_ and _Vitis rupestris_ and\r\nthat it is not distinctly defined and of a uniform character, but shows\r\nin its variable forms different combinations of the characters of these\r\ntwo species. There seems to be some doubt among other botanists as to\r\nthe parentage of Champini and it is variously credited to Candicans,\r\nRupestris, Monticola and Berlandieri.\r\n\r\nThis species is found growing in the limestone hills of southwestern\r\nTexas, covering about the same area as Berlandieri. According to Munson\r\nit is less common in the bottoms and is not so plentiful as the latter\r\nspecies. Associated with it in different parts of its habitat are the\r\nfour species mentioned above as possible parents.\r\n\r\nChampini is particularly well adapted to hot dry regions and will\r\nwithstand considerable lime in the soil. The species is susceptible to\r\nmildew and black-rot. It can be readily grown from cuttings and grafts\r\nwell in the vineyard, though the different forms are quite variable in\r\nthese respects. At one time this species was considered of great promise\r\nas a stock for Vinifera for hot, dry regions but as it has proved\r\ninferior to Berlandieri in its capacity to withstand limy soils and\r\nphylloxera, and as it is not more vigorous, it has been generally\r\ndropped. The berries are large and of pure flavor, and as the vine is\r\nvigorous, it may prove of value as a source of cultivated varieties for\r\nthe Southwest but it is of little or no value to the eastern grower.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. =VITIS RUBRA= Michx.\r\n\r\n     =1.= Vahl,[141] _Symb.

Shoots\r\n     smooth, angled, long-jointed, bright red; diaphragms thick to\r\n     medium; tendrils intermittent, long, usually bifid. Leaves with\r\n     short, broad stipules; leaf-blade broadly cordate in outline,\r\n     rarely entire, frequently very deeply three or even five-lobed,\r\n     lobes long, acuminate; margin with broad, shallow, serrate teeth;\r\n     petiolar sinus rather broad and shallow; upper surface dull dark\r\n     green, smooth; lower surface frequently somewhat pubescent on ribs\r\n     and veins; petioles red. Clusters medium to large, loose, seldom\r\n     compound; long peduncle. Berries small, black, without bloom, not\r\n     juicy. Seeds one or two, large, plump, rounded, with very short\r\n     beak, slightly notched; chalaza narrow, rather indistinct; raphe\r\n     indistinct.\r\n\r\n_Vitis rubra_ and Vahl's _Vitis palmata_ are badly confused. The species\r\nwas first described by Vahl in 1794, from plants cultivated in the\r\nJardin des Plantes in Paris and supposed to have been sent by some\r\nmissionary from the Mississippi Valley. It was so named on account of\r\nits tendency to five-lobed leaves. Vahl erroneously gives its habitat as\r\nVirginia. About the same time, Michaux discovered, on the banks of the\r\nMississippi and adjacent streams, a grape which he called _Vitis rubra_,\r\non account of its characteristic bright red shoots. The descriptions of\r\nthese two varieties were copied from time to time by other botanists,\r\nbut with no additional details of any importance until Engelmann, in\r\n1883, made the claim that they were identical. There is no question as\r\nto the identity of Michaux's Rubra, but some botanists question whether\r\nPalmata is a synonym. We have taken Michaux's name as the one to which\r\nthere is no question, although Engelmann was so careful a worker that it\r\nis highly probable that he is correct in considering the two species\r\nsynonymous. Munson considers the species as probably a multiple \"hybrid\r\nof Cordifolia with Riparia, with possibly a trace of Cissus blood,\r\nindicated in the fruit, seed and leaf.\" There seems to be but little\r\nevidence to support this supposition. Planchon says it is principally on\r\nthe evidence of Millardet that he admits this as a separate species and\r\nthat perhaps it would be better to consider it a variety of Riparia\r\nclosely allied to Vahl's Palmata.\r\n\r\n_Vitis rubra_ is an inhabitant of sandy, rich, moist, alluvial river\r\nbottoms in Missouri and Illinois, to Louisiana and Texas, in which\r\nregion it is quite restricted and apparently not plentiful.\r\n\r\nBut little is known of the horticultural characters of _Vitis rubra_. In\r\nspite of its having been classed with Riparia, it appears to resemble\r\nmore closely _Vitis cordifolia_, having the thick diaphragms and late\r\nblooming characters of the latter species, but the seeds resemble those\r\nof Riparia. Rubra grows readily from cuttings and the roots are said to\r\nbe very resistant to phylloxera. It is not sufficiently vigorous,\r\nhowever, to be recommended as a stock. It is sometimes cultivated as an\r\nornamental but is of no horticultural importance beyond this.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. =VITIS CORDIFOLIA= Michx.\r\n\r\n     =1.= (?) Linnaeus, _Sp. Pl._, =1753=:203. V.

Shoots rather slender; internodes\r\n     long, slightly angular, usually glabrous, sometimes slightly\r\n     pubescent; diaphragms thick; tendrils intermittent, long, usually\r\n     bifid. Leaves with short, broad stipules; leaf-blade medium to\r\n     large, cordate, entire or sometimes indistinctly three-lobed;\r\n     petiolar sinus deep, usually narrow, acute; margin with rather\r\n     coarse angular teeth; point of leaf acuminate; upper surface rather\r\n     light green, glossy, glabrous; glabrous or sparingly pubescent\r\n     below. Clusters medium to large, loose, with long peduncle. Berries\r\n     numerous and small, black, shining, little or no bloom. Seeds\r\n     medium in size, rather broad, beak rather short; chalaza oval or\r\n     roundish, elevated, very distinct; raphe a distinct, cord-like\r\n     ridge. Fruit usually sour and astringent and frequently consisting\r\n     of little besides skins and seeds. Leafing, flowering and ripening\r\n     fruit very late.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that Cordifolia and Riparia have been badly confused\r\nin the past, the limits of the habitat of this species are difficult to\r\ndetermine. Pursh gives the northern limit as Canada, and Buckley speaks\r\nof its being found at Lake Winnipeg, but all other, and some probably\r\nbetter informed, authorities give the northern limit as New York or the\r\nGreat Lakes. The eastern limit is the Atlantic Ocean and the southern\r\nlimit the Gulf of Mexico. It extends westward, according to Engelmann,\r\nto the western limits of the wooded portion of the Mississippi Valley in\r\nthe North, and, according to Munson, to the Brazos River, Texas, in the\r\nSouth. It is found along creeks and river banks sometimes mixed with\r\nRiparia, having about the same soil adaptations as that species. It is a\r\nvery common species in the Middle States and is frequently found growing\r\non limestone soils but, according to Viala, is not indigenous to such\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nIt might be said that this species was first described by Linnaeus in\r\n1753 under the name Vulpina, as his description was from mixed specimens\r\nof Cordifolia and Riparia. The first description, however, of which\r\nthere is no question is that of Michaux in 1803. From this time on there\r\nare many descriptions under various names and much disagreement as to\r\nthe limits of the species and its relation to Riparia. Engelmann in 1872\r\nstates that Riparia is generally a smaller plant than Cordifolia and\r\nthat the fruit ripens earlier and is pleasanter tasting. It was still\r\nconsidered by many botanists that these differences were too slight to\r\nseparate the forms as different species, but in 1883, Engelmann further\r\nenumerated other differences which are given under the description of\r\n_Vitis riparia_. Since this time, the specific difference of the two\r\nforms has never been questioned.\r\n\r\nCordifolia makes a good stock for grafting, being vigorous and forming a\r\ngood union with most of our cultivated grapes. It is seldom used for\r\nthis purpose, however, on account of the difficulty of propagating it by\r\nmeans of cuttings. For the same reason vines of it are seldom found in\r\ncultivation. It is probably of no importance horticulturally.\r\n\r\n\r\n=VITIS CORDIFOLIA FOETIDA= Engelm.\r\n\r\n     =1.= Engelmann, _Am. Nat._, =2=:321. 1868. V.

In 1872 he speaks\r\nas though this is the common Mississippi Valley form, for he says: \"In\r\nthis valley at least the fruit has a strongly and even fetidly-aromatic\r\ntaste\". The variety apparently is similar to the typical Cordifolia in\r\nevery respect excepting the aromatic fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n=VITIS CORDIFOLIA SEMPERVIRENS= Munson.\r\n\r\n     =1.= Munson, _Rev.

It differs\r\nfrom typical Cordifolia in having leaves which are thicker, narrower,\r\nmore oblong, with a long lanceolate point, completely glabrous and more\r\nor less glossy on both surfaces. These leaves remain on the vines very\r\nlate in the season. This variety is said to be very resistant to an\r\nexcess of lime in the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n=VITIS CORDIFOLIA HELLERI= Bailey.\r\n\r\n     =1.= Bailey, _Gray's Syn. Fl._, =1=:424. 1897. V.

It\r\ndiffers from the ordinary forms of Cordifolia in having more circular\r\nleaves without the lanceolate point. Viala and Ravaz state that such\r\nforms are found in clay soils. Bailey refers to it as an upland\r\nsouth-Texas form found at altitudes of from 1600 to 2000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. =VITIS BAILEYANA= Munson.\r\n\r\n     =1.= Munson, _U. S. D. A. Pom.

Canes slender, with short internodes, and with very\r\n     many short side shoots; shoots angular, densely whitish or rusty\r\n     pubescent or woolly along the angles; mature canes round, nearly\r\n     smooth; diaphragms thick; tendrils intermittent, usually trifid.\r\n     Leaves with blade long, cordate, frequently smaller than\r\n     Cordifolia, shortly but distinctly three-lobed (lobes mostly\r\n     pointed and much spreading), bright green, but not shining, above,\r\n     gray below, slightly pubescent at maturity only on veins; apex\r\n     short, acuminate, acute or blunt; teeth comparatively small and\r\n     notched-like, regular, not prominently acute. Clusters large;\r\n     peduncle long; pedicel slender, short, making the bunch very\r\n     compact. Berries very small, black with little or no bloom,\r\n     intensely acid until very ripe or frosted. Seeds small to very\r\n     small, slightly notched on top; chalaza depressed, oblong-oval;\r\n     raphe broad, slightly distinct. Leafing, flowering and ripening\r\n     fruit very late.\r\n\r\nThis species seems to have been first described by Munson in 1890 under\r\nthe name of _Vitis virginiana_. In 1893 he issued a leaflet changing the\r\nname to _Vitis baileyana_.\r\n\r\nIt is an upland species growing in the mountain valleys (800 feet and\r\nupward) of southwestern Virginia, West Virginia, western North Carolina,\r\nTennessee, northern Georgia and the uplands of western central Georgia.\r\n\r\nBaileyana can be propagated from cuttings only with difficulty. It is of\r\nno importance horticulturally.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. =VITIS BERLANDIERI= Planch.\r\n\r\n     =1.= Planchon, _Compt. Rend. Acad. Sci. Paris_, =91=:425. 1880.\r\n     (cited by =5=). =2.= _Journ.

Leaves with small\r\n     stipules; leaf-blade rather large, broadly cordate, notched or\r\n     shortly three-lobed; petiolar sinus rather open, V- or U-shaped,\r\n     margin with broad but rather shallow teeth, rather dark, glossy\r\n     green above, grayish pubescence below when young; becoming glabrous\r\n     and even glossy except on ribs and veins, when mature. Clusters\r\n     large, compact, compound, with long peduncle. Berries small, black,\r\n     with thin bloom, juicy, rather tart but pleasant tasting when\r\n     thoroughly ripe. Seeds few, medium to small, short, plump, oval or\r\n     roundish with short beak; chalaza oval or roundish, distinct; raphe\r\n     narrow, slightly distinct to indistinct. Leafing, flowering and\r\n     ripening fruit very late.\r\n\r\nThis species was described under the name _Vitis berlandieri_ by\r\nPlanchon in 1880. The description was made from herbarium specimens\r\ncollected by the Swiss botanist, Berlandier,[142] in Texas in 1834, and\r\nalso from living plants which had been shipped into France. Planchon\r\nstates that this is the Monticola of Engelmann, but not the Monticola of\r\nBuckley. Buckley's description is admittedly unsatisfactory but it does\r\nnot seem that Planchon is justified in saying that Engelmann was\r\nmistaken when the latter probably had better opportunities for\r\ndetermining Buckley's meaning than Planchon.\r\n\r\nBerlandieri is a native of the limestone hills of southwest Texas and\r\nadjacent Mexico. According to Munson, it grows \"in the same region with\r\n_V. monticola_ but is less restricted locally, growing from the tops of\r\nthe hills all along down and along the creek bottoms of those regions.\"\r\nIts great virtue is that it withstands a soil largely composed of lime.\r\nIt is superior to all other American species in this respect. This and\r\nits moderate degree of vigor (not quite so vigorous as Cinerea,\r\naccording to Munson) has recommended it to the French growers as a stock\r\nfor their calcareous soils. The roots are strong, thick and very\r\nresistant to phylloxera.\r\n\r\nIt is propagated by cuttings with comparative ease, but its varieties\r\nare variable in this respect, some not rooting at all easily. While the\r\nfruit of this species shows a large cluster, the berries are small and\r\nsour, and Berlandieri is not regarded as having any promise for culture\r\nin America.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. =VITIS CINEREA= Engelm.[143]\r\n\r\n     =1.= Engelmann, _Gray's Man._, Edition 5. =1867=:679.

Leaves large, cordate, seldom lobed but\r\n     frequently notched; frequently resembling a linden leaf; petiolar\r\n     sinus medium in depth and width, rounded; margin shallowly but\r\n     sharply toothed; upper surface cobwebby when young, becoming\r\n     glabrous and dull when mature; lower surface and petiole covered\r\n     with grayish cobwebby pubescence. Cluster large, rather loose;\r\n     peduncle long; pedicel slender. Berries small, black, with little\r\n     if any bloom. Seeds small, plump, short beak; chalaza round or\r\n     oval, distinct; raphe ridge-like, distinct to slightly distinct.\r\n     Ripening very late, becoming sweet after frost.\r\n\r\nCinerea is very closely allied to Aestivalis and was for a long time\r\nconsidered a part of that species. In 1867 Engelmann described it under\r\nthe name _Vitis aestivalis_, var. _cinerea_, but in 1883 he made it a\r\nspecies and it has been generally regarded by botanists that the points\r\nof difference between the two forms are such that the Cinerea deserves\r\nspecific recognition.\r\n\r\nIts habitat is New York, west to Nebraska and Kansas with about 40\r\ndegrees as a northern limit, southward to the Gulf. Cinerea grows along\r\nstreams mostly in limy soils, and is seldom found in very dry land. It\r\ncovers about the same range as Cordifolia excepting that it grows nearer\r\nthe Gulf and extends across the Rio Grande into Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe species is very late in blooming, later even than Cordifolia. It can\r\nbe propagated from cuttings only with difficulty. It is probably of no\r\nimportance horticulturally unless it be for wet lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n=VITIS CINEREA FLORIDANA= Munson.\r\n\r\n     =1.= Munson, _U. S. D. A. Pom. Bul._, =3=:14. 1890. V.

It was\r\nlater described by Parry, botanist of the Department of Agriculture,\r\nfrom specimens sent to him by Dr. Charles Smart, an army surgeon\r\nstationed in southern Arizona, in 1867. Parry says that Engelmann\r\nconsidered it a distinct species and had provisionally named it _Vitis\r\narizonensis_. As to the name, this is evidently an error in quoting\r\nEngelmann.\r\n\r\nIts habitat is \"Western Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Chihuahua (Mexico),\r\nand South Utah.\"\r\n\r\nThis grape is adapted only to the arid districts of the West. When\r\nraised in humid climates it is subject to the attacks of mildew and\r\nblack-rot. As might be expected from its habitat, it endures intense\r\ndrouths. It grows well on limestone, pebbly, or alluvial soils. It has a\r\nconsiderable degree of resistance to phylloxera, grows readily from\r\ncuttings, and according to Munson, can withstand zero temperature\r\nwithout injury. As the European grapes can be raised in its native\r\ncountry, it is not there regarded as valuable, although the fruit is\r\nsaid to be rich in sugar and to be of pure flavor. It has been used in\r\nCalifornia as a stock, but is not regarded in any section very favorably\r\nand its use has never become extensive probably owing to its lack of\r\nvigor. It suckers less than Rupestris. Arizonica blossoms about the time\r\nof Labrusca. It is of no value to the grape-growers of the East and\r\nprobably of none to those of the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n=VITIS ARIZONICA GLABRA= Munson.\r\n\r\n     =1.= Munson, _Gar. and For._, =3=:474. 1890.

It was later\r\nmentioned by Newberry, Torrey and others. As these descriptions were all\r\nmade either from herbarium specimens or by botanists traveling through\r\nthe region, they are not so definite as those made later.\r\n\r\nThe habitat of Californica is the northern half of California along\r\nstreams west of the Sierra Nevada mountains and north into Rogue River\r\nValley in southern Oregon, its northern limit.\r\n\r\nThis species is interesting in that it is a native of a region of North\r\nAmerica not originally infested with phylloxera, but in which phylloxera\r\nhas since been introduced. As might be suspected, it has little more\r\nresistance to this insect than Vinifera and less than any other\r\nAmerican species. The roots are thick and fleshy, resembling Vinifera.\r\nThe fruit, while pleasant, is too small to be of cultural value. It is\r\ntoo tender for planting in the open ground where the thermometer drops\r\nmuch below freezing. California growers state that it does not flourish\r\nin dry shallow soils. It is very susceptible to attacks of mildew, to\r\nwhich it usually succumbs when planted east of the Rocky Mountains.\r\nCalifornica grows readily from cuttings. It is sometimes used in its\r\nnative country as an ornamental on account of its highly colored autumn\r\nfoliage but is otherwise of no value.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. =VITIS GIRDIANA= Munson.\r\n\r\n     =1.= Munson, _Soc.

Leaves with medium to small\r\n     stipules; blade broadly cordate, rather thin, entire or obscurely\r\n     three-lobed (sometimes distinctly three-lobed on young shoots);\r\n     petiolar sinus usually narrow, rather deep; margin with many small\r\n     and acute teeth; under surface covered with thick grayish\r\n     persistent pubescence. Cluster medium to large, compound, rather\r\n     loose; peduncle of medium length, slender. Berries small, black,\r\n     with thin bloom; skin thin but tough; medium to late in ripening.\r\n     Sweet when ripe with a sharp pungency in the skin. Seeds similar to\r\n     those of _Vitis californica_.\r\n\r\nGirdiana was separated from _Vitis californica_ by Munson in 1887. It is\r\nclosely allied to, and is by many botanists still considered a variety\r\nof Californica. Wild hybrids with _Vitis vinifera_ are frequently found\r\nin regions where it is indigenous.\r\n\r\nGirdiana inhabits southern California in the region west and north of\r\nYuma and the valleys of southern California southward into Mexico. Its\r\nnorthern limit is approximately the Mojave desert. The individuals of\r\nthe species are very numerous, covering shrubs and trees in the regions\r\nwhere it grows.\r\n\r\nThe species is very susceptible to mildew and black-rot, and like\r\nCalifornica is not resistant to phylloxera. Girdiana is more sensitive\r\nto cold than Vinifera. Analyses show that the fruit of the species is\r\ndeficient in sugar and acid. Girdiana is but little known but certainly\r\nis of no value to the grape-growers of the East or North and probably\r\nof none to those of the Southwest.\r\n\r\n\r\n17. =VITIS DOANIANA= Munson.\r\n\r\n     =1.= _An.

Leaves medium in size,\r\n     broadly cordate, notched or lobed and with a triangular apex;\r\n     petiolar sinus medium in depth, usually narrow; margins with rather\r\n     large, notched-like teeth; upper surface of a peculiar\r\n     bluish-green, frequently somewhat rugose with more or less\r\n     tomentum; lower surface usually with a dense whitish pubescence\r\n     which shows also on shoots. Cluster medium to small. Berries\r\n     variable in size, average medium, black with a thick bloom. Seeds\r\n     somewhat resembling Labrusca but with shorter beak and more\r\n     distinct chalaza; has characteristic groove extending from chalaza\r\n     to beak.\r\n\r\nDoaniana is quite variable, some specimens being nearly glabrous at\r\nmaturity while others are densely covered with white pubescence. Munson\r\nhas separated the species into two forms which he calls the early\r\nDoaniana and the late Doaniana. The species was described and named by\r\nMunson in 1890.\r\n\r\nIt is found chiefly in northwest Texas but it ranges from Oklahoma to\r\nbeyond the Pecos River in New Mexico. It is considered by Bailey and\r\nViala to be a probable hybrid with _Vitis candicans_ as one of the\r\nparents. Doaniana is exceedingly hardy, withstanding great cold as well\r\nas great heat. It apparently prefers rather light soils as it is\r\nindigenous to sandbanks along rivers and the beds of sandy ravines.\r\n\r\nMunson states that in cultivation it does well in any but very limy\r\nsoils. The fruit is of comparatively good quality but the skin possesses\r\nsome of the pungency of Candicans. The berries are quite persistent,\r\nhanging to the pedicel some time after ripe. The vines are not\r\nproductive. The character of the must is apparently unknown. The roots\r\nare hard, penetrate deeply into the soil, and are resistant to\r\nphylloxera though somewhat variable in this respect. Doaniana grows\r\nreadily from cuttings and grafts well in the vineyard. The species\r\nblossoms with or just before Labrusca. It is of doubtful value to the\r\nsouthern grape-growers and is of no value in the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. =VITIS AESTIVALIS= Michx.\r\n\r\n     =1.= (?) Marshall, =1785=:165. V.

Leaves with short, broad stipules; leaf-blade medium to very\r\n     large, rather thin when young but becoming rather thick; petiolar\r\n     sinus deep, usually narrow, frequently overlapping; margin rarely\r\n     entire, usually three- to five-lobed; teeth dentate, shallow,\r\n     medium wide; upper surface rather dark green; lower surface with\r\n     more or less reddish or rusty pubescence which, in mature leaves,\r\n     usually shows in patches on the ribs and veins; petioles frequently\r\n     pubescent. Clusters medium to large, usually long, not much\r\n     branched, with long peduncle. Berries small to medium, with\r\n     moderate amount of bloom, usually somewhat astringent. Seeds two to\r\n     three, of medium size to above, plump, usually smooth, not notched;\r\n     chalaza oval, distinct; raphe a distinct cord-like ridge. Leafing\r\n     and ripening fruit late to very late. (See Plate.)\r\n\r\n_Vitis aestivalis_ is variable, particularly in its leaf characters,\r\nsuch as quantity of pubescence, size, shape and thickness of leaf. Those\r\nwho are most familiar with it are of the opinion that in a general way\r\nthe leaves increase in thickness southward and that the pubescence\r\ndiminishes in quantity and becomes stiffer on dry, poor soils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =SHOOT OF= _VITIS AESTIVALIS_]\r\n\r\nAestivalis was probably described by some of the botanists before\r\nMichaux's day but, if so, none of the descriptions is sufficiently\r\ndefinite and comprehensive to be recognized with certainty. Michaux was\r\nthe first to describe it under the name of Aestivalis. It seems to have\r\nbeen generally known, as Bartram described it a short time later under\r\nthe name of _Vitis sylvestris_ with _Vitis occidentalis_ as a synonym.\r\nHe says: \"This is the most common grape.\" Owing to the great variation\r\nin the different forms of the species as it was then understood, many of\r\nthe later botanists gave descriptions of it which did not agree. This\r\nuncertainty and the difficulty of giving a description which would fit\r\nall of the forms has been relieved in a measure; first, by the new\r\nspecies which have been created, such as Bicolor, Monticola and Cinerea,\r\nfrom what would have once been regarded as Aestivalis; and second, by\r\nthe description and general acceptance of well-known varietal forms,\r\nsuch as Lincecumii and Bourquiniana.\r\n\r\nThe division of the original species has also reduced the habitat\r\nmaterially, confining it to the southeastern portion of the United\r\nStates from southern New York to Florida and westward to the Mississippi\r\nRiver. Aestivalis grows in thickets and openings in the woods and shows\r\nno such fondness for streams as Riparia or for thick timber as Labrusca,\r\nbut is generally confined to uplands. Under favorable circumstances the\r\nvines grow to be very large.\r\n\r\nAestivalis is preeminently a wine grape. The fruit usually has a tart,\r\nacrid taste, due to the presence of a high percentage of acid, but there\r\nis also a large amount of sugar, the scale showing that juice from this\r\nspecies has a much higher percentage of sugar than the sweeter tasting\r\nLabruscas. The wine made from varieties of Aestivalis is very rich in\r\ncoloring matter, and is used by some European vintners to mix with the\r\nmust of European sorts in order to give the combined product a higher\r\ncolor. The berries are destitute of pulp, have a comparatively thin,\r\ntough skin, and a peculiar spicy flavor. The berries hang to the bunch\r\nafter becoming ripe much better than do those of Labrusca.\r\n\r\nThe species thrives in a lighter and shallower soil than Labrusca and\r\nappears to endure drouth better, although not equaling in this respect\r\neither Riparia or Rupestris. A southern or southeastern exposure gives\r\nbetter results for Aestivalis or Aestivalis hybrid vines than a northern\r\none. The French growers report that Aestivalis is very liable to\r\nchlorosis on soils which contain much lime. The leaves are never injured\r\nby the sun, and they resist the attacks of insects, such as\r\nleaf-hoppers, better than any other American species under cultivation.\r\nAestivalis is rarely injured by rot or mildew, according to American\r\nexperience, but French growers speak of its being susceptible to both.\r\n\r\nThe hard roots of Aestivalis enable it to resist phylloxera, and\r\nvarieties with any great amount of the blood of this species are seldom\r\nseriously injured by this insect. An objection to Aestivalis, from a\r\nhorticultural standpoint, is that it does not root well from cuttings.\r\nMany authorities speak of it as not rooting at all from cuttings, but\r\nthis is an overstatement of the facts, as many of the wild and\r\ncultivated varieties are occasionally propagated in this manner, and\r\nsome southern nurseries, located in particularly favorable situations,\r\nmake a practice of propagating it by this method. It is doubtful,\r\nhowever, if it could be successfully propagated from cuttings in New\r\nYork. Varieties of this species bear grafting well, especially in the\r\nvineyard. Aestivalis blooms just after Labrusca. As might be inferred\r\nfrom its habitat, most cultivated varieties of this species require a\r\nlonger season to mature their fruit than that of New York. On this\r\naccount it is probable that Bicolor, once known as a northern form of\r\nAestivalis, is more promising horticulturally for the North than the\r\ntrue Aestivalis of the Southeast.\r\n\r\n\r\n=VITIS AESTIVALIS LINCECUMII=[145] Munson.\r\n\r\n     =1.= (?)

Leaves very\r\n     large, almost as wide as long; entire or three-, five-, or rarely\r\n     seven-lobed; lobes frequently divided; sinuses, including petiolar\r\n     sinus, deep; smooth above, and with more or less rusty pubescence\r\n     below. (The north-Texas, southwestern Missouri and northern\r\n     Arkansas form shows little or no pubescence but has fine prickly\r\n     spines at base of shoots and shows much blue bloom on shoots, canes\r\n     and the under side of the leaves.) Fruit small to large, usually\r\n     larger than typical Aestivalis, usually black with heavy bloom.\r\n     Seeds larger than Aestivalis, pear-shaped; chalaza roundish.\r\n\r\nLincecumii seems to have been first described by Rafinesque, in 1830\r\nunder the name _Vitis multiloba_. His description fits fairly well, and\r\nas the source from which the vines were secured is within the habitat of\r\nthe species, there appears but little doubt as to its correctness. In\r\nthe same year Prince gives a very brief description of a grape from\r\nTexas under the name _Vitis diversifolia_ which is probably this grape.\r\nThe first description of the variety (or species) in such detail that it\r\ncould not be mistaken was that of Buckley in 1861, as _Vitis\r\nlinsecomii_.\r\n\r\nIt inhabits the eastern half of Texas, western Louisiana, Indian\r\nTerritory, Arkansas and southern Missouri on high sandy land, frequently\r\nclimbing post-oak trees, hence the name, Post-oak grape, by which it is\r\nlocally known.\r\n\r\nLincecumii has attracted considerable attention through the work of H.\r\nJaeger and T. V. Munson in domesticating it, both of whom considered it\r\none of the most, if not the most, promising form from which to secure\r\ncultivated varieties for the Southwest. The qualities which recommended\r\nit to them are: First, its vigor; second, its capacity to withstand rot\r\nand mildew; third, its hardiness and capacity to endure hot and dry\r\nsummers without injury; and fourth, the large cluster and berry which\r\nwere found on certain of the wild vines. It requires a longer season to\r\nmature than that of New York and is, consequently, of but little\r\ninterest to grape-growers in this State. The fruit is characteristic\r\nbecause of its dense bloom, firm, yet tender texture and the peculiar\r\nso-called Post-oak flavor. The cultivated varieties have given\r\nsatisfaction in many sections of the central western and southern\r\nstates. Like Aestivalis, it is difficult to propagate from cuttings.\r\n\r\nThe north-Texas glaucous form of this variety mentioned in the technical\r\ndescription above is the _Vitis aestivalis glauca_ of Bailey.

BOURQUINIANA; _Southern Aestivalis_. =16.= Viala and\r\n     Ravaz, _Am. Vines_, =1903=:178. V. BOURQUINIANA.\r\n\r\nBourquiniana greatly resembles Aestivalis and differs chiefly from this\r\nspecies in having thinner leaves and in that the shoots and under side\r\nof the leaves are only slightly reddish-brown in color and the\r\npubescence usually disappears at maturity; this pubescence is mostly of\r\nan ashy or dun color. The leaves on some of the vines are more deeply\r\nlobed than is at all common in Aestivalis. The fruit is considerably\r\nlarger than that of Aestivalis, sweeter and more juicy.\r\n\r\nThe botanical variety, Bourquiniana, is known only in cultivation. It is\r\nmentioned by Garber in 1859 and by Engelmann in 1883. Speaking of\r\nAestivalis the latter says: \"Unfortunately the typical forms cannot be\r\npropagated by cuttings and there are a number of varieties which,\r\noriginating from a southern home, are not quite hardy here but on the\r\nother hand have the advantage of being readily propagated by slips in\r\nsome favorable localities. * * * Unfortunately no wild plant from which\r\nthese varieties might have sprung is yet known but must be looked for in\r\nthe mountains and hills of the Carolinas and Georgia and only when found\r\nin a wild state can we correctly judge of their botanical status.\"\r\n\r\nThe name Bourquiniana was given by Munson, who ranks the group as a\r\nspecies. He includes therein many southern varieties the most important\r\nof which are: Herbemont, Bertrand, Cunningham, and Lenoir, these he\r\ngroups in the Herbemont section; and Devereaux, Louisiana and Warren, he\r\nputs in the Devereaux section. Munson has traced the history of this\r\ninteresting group and states that it was brought from southern France to\r\nAmerica over 150 years ago by the Bourquin family of Savannah, Georgia.\r\nMany botanists have been of the opinion that Bourquiniana is a hybrid.\r\nEngelmann says: \"I will only state here that a slight suspicion exists\r\nof their being hybrids between _V. aestivalis_ and some form of\r\n_vinifera_ though the seeds are entirely those of the former and also\r\nthe resistance to phylloxera.\" Millardet considers Bourquiniana to be a\r\nmixed hybrid of Aestivalis, Cinerea and Vinifera. The hybrid supposition\r\nis certainly corroborated to a degree at least by the characters being\r\nmore or less intermediate between the parent species and also by the\r\nfact that up to date no wild form of Bourquiniana has been found.\r\n\r\nMunson's derivation of the origin has not been accepted by either French\r\nor American botanists. In this connection Bailey says: \"It is\r\nunassumable that a native grape distributed through the Mediterranean\r\nregion could have escaped for centuries the critical search of European\r\nbotanists and the knowledge of hundreds of generations of vignerons to\r\nbe discovered at last transplanted in the new world.\" Bush says: \"This\r\nreminds us forcibly of the '_Pedro Ximenes_' (called also White Green\r\nRiesling), which was believed to have been brought to Spain from the\r\nbanks of the _Moselle_ by the man whose name it bears.\" Count Odart, a\r\ncelebrated ampelograph, wittily said: \"If he (Ximenes) took any he took\r\nALL, for no _such_ vine grows now north of the Pyrenees.' Thus we also\r\nthink: If Mr. Bourquin took any of the above grapes he took ALL, for no\r\n_Herbemont_ or _Lenoir_ can now be found native in Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThe only northern variety of grape of any importance that is supposed to\r\nhave Bourquiniana blood is the Delaware,[147] and in this case only a\r\nfraction of Bourquiniana blood is presumably present.\r\n\r\nBourquiniana can be propagated from cuttings more easily than the\r\ntypical Aestivalis but not so readily as Labrusca, Riparia or Vinifera.\r\nMany of the varieties of Bourquiniana show a marked susceptibility to\r\nmildew and black-rot; in fact, the whole Herbemont group is much\r\ninferior in this respect to the Norton group of Aestivalis. The roots\r\nare somewhat hard, branch rather freely and are quite resistant to\r\nphylloxera.\r\n\r\n\r\n19. =VITIS BICOLOR= Le Conte.[148]\r\n\r\n     =1.= Le Conte, _Proc. Phil. Acad. Nat.

Leaves with\r\n     short, broad stipules; leaf-blade medium to very large;\r\n     roundish-cordate, usually three-, sometimes on older growth\r\n     shallowly five-lobed, rarely entire; petiolar sinus variable in\r\n     depth, usually rather narrow; margin irregularly dentate; teeth\r\n     acuminate; glabrous above, usually glabrous below and showing much\r\n     blue bloom which sometimes disappears late in the season; young\r\n     leaves sometimes slightly pubescent; petioles very long. Cluster of\r\n     medium size, compact, usually simple; peduncle long. Berries small\r\n     to medium, black with much blue bloom, rather acid but pleasant\r\n     tasting when ripe. Seeds small, plump, broadly oval, very short\r\n     beak; chalaza oval, raised, distinct; raphe distinct, showing as a\r\n     cord-like ridge.\r\n\r\nBicolor is readily distinguished from Aestivalis by the absence of the\r\nreddish pubescence, and by the bloom on the under side of the leaves and\r\nis distinguished from the glaucous form of Lincecumii by the smaller\r\nfruit and seeds. The species blooms slightly later than Aestivalis and\r\nLincecumii. It was named and described by Le Conte in 1853 and has been\r\ngenerally recognized as a distinct species by later botanists.\r\n\r\nThe habitat of Bicolor is to the north of that of Aestivalis, occupying\r\nthe northeastern, whereas Aestivalis occupies the southeastern quarter\r\nof the United States. Like Aestivalis it is not confined to streams and\r\nriver-banks but frequently grows on higher land also. It is found in\r\nnorth Missouri, Illinois, southwestern Wisconsin, Indiana, southern\r\nMichigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, New York, southwestern Ontario,\r\nNew Jersey and Maryland, and is by some botanists reported as far south\r\nas western North Carolina and west Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe horticultural characters of Bicolor are much the same as those of\r\nAestivalis. About the only points of difference are that it is much\r\nhardier (some of the Wisconsin vines stand a temperature as low as 20\r\ndegrees below zero); it is said to be slightly less resistant to mildew\r\nand more resistant to phylloxera. Like Aestivalis, Bicolor does not\r\nthrive on limy soils and it is difficult to propagate from cuttings.\r\nThe horticultural possibilities of Bicolor are probably much the same as\r\nthose of Aestivalis, though many believe it to be more promising for the\r\nNorth. It is as yet cultivated but little. Its chief defect for\r\ndomestication is the small size of the fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n20. =VITIS CARIBÆA= De Candolle.[149]\r\n\r\n     =1.= De Candolle, _Prodr._, =1=:634. 1824 (cited by Watson). =2.=\r\n     Chapman, _Fl.

Leaves with medium to large\r\n     stipules; blade small to medium, broadly cordate to reniform ovate,\r\n     frequently resembling those of a poplar, entire or in young shoots\r\n     and on young vines and sprouts usually deeply from three- to five-,\r\n     or even seven-lobed; teeth shallow, sinuate; petiolar sinus\r\n     shallow, wide, sometimes lacking; dull, slightly rugose above,\r\n     dense whitish pubescence below.

In 1861 it was described by\r\nBuckley who seems to have been unaware of the species having been\r\npreviously named.\r\n\r\nThe habitat of this grape extends from southern Oklahoma, as a northern\r\nlimit, southwesterly into Mexico. The western boundary is the Pecos\r\nRiver. It is found on dry, alluvial, sandy or limestone bottoms or on\r\nlimestone bluff lands and is said to be especially abundant along upland\r\nravines. Candicans grows well on limestone lands enduring as much as 60\r\nper ct. of carbonate of lime in the soil. The species blooms shortly\r\nbefore Labrusca and a week later than Riparia. It requires the long hot\r\nsummers of its native country and will stand extreme drouth but is not\r\nhardy to cold, ten or fifteen degrees below zero killing the vine\r\noutright unless protected; and a lesser degree of cold injuring it\r\nseverely. The berries, which are large for wild vines, have thin skins\r\nunder which there is a pigment which gives them, when first ripe, a\r\nfiery, pungent taste but which partly disappears with maturity. The\r\nberries are very persistent, clinging to the pedicel long after ripe.\r\nCandicans is difficult to propagate from cuttings. Its roots resist\r\nphylloxera fairly well. It makes a good stock for Vinifera vines in its\r\nnative country but owing to the difficulty of propagation is seldom used\r\nfor that purpose. In the early days of Texas it was much used for the\r\nmaking of wine but as it is deficient in sugar, and as the must retains\r\nthe acrid, pungent flavor, it does not seem to be well adapted for this\r\npurpose. It is not regarded as having great promise for southern\r\nhorticulture and certainly has none for the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n=VITIS CANDICANS CORIACEA= Bailey.\r\n\r\n     =1.= Shuttleworth Mss., Herb.

The\r\nblossoming period is two or three weeks later than the Texas form.\r\n\r\nThis form of Candicans was named and described by Shuttleworth in a\r\nmanuscript now in the Herbarium Boissier at Geneva, Switzerland.\r\nBotanists seem divided as whether to regard it as a separate species or\r\nas a botanical variety. Its habitat is central and southern Florida.\r\n\r\nCoriacea is more tender than the regular forms of _Vitis candicans_ and\r\nthis alone would make it worthless to the northern cultivator even were\r\nit otherwise valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\n22. =VITIS SIMPSONI= Munson.\r\n\r\n     =1.= Munson, _Soc.

In\r\n1891 he stated that the species is a hybrid of _Vitis coriacea_ (here\r\nconsidered a variety of _Vitis candicans_) crossed with _Vitis cinerea_.\r\nBailey states that it is probably a hybrid of Aestivalis crossed with\r\nCoriacea. Some forms of Simpsoni are said to be very difficult to\r\ndistinguish from _Vitis labrusca_.\r\n\r\nSimpsoni prefers warm, sandy soils and is found in central and southern\r\nFlorida. It roots from cuttings with great difficulty; it is tender and\r\nwill not withstand cold winters. While it is very resistant to\r\nphylloxera and also to mildew and black-rot, its leaves are said to be\r\nmuch attacked by leaf-rollers. The blossoming period is just after\r\nAestivalis. The berries are of good flavor and might be of some value\r\nfor the country along the Gulf Coast but it is of no value for the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\n\r\n23. =VITIS LABRUSCA=[150] Linn.[151]\r\n\r\n     =1.= Linnaeus, _Sp.

(See\r\n     Plate.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOOT OF _VITUS LABRUSCA_]\r\n\r\n_Vitis labrusca_, the northern Fox grape, is mentioned in many of the\r\nearly writings of this country, particularly in those describing New\r\nEngland. It was probably described by other botanists before Linnaeus\r\nbut if so their descriptions are so meager that it cannot be definitely\r\nrecognized. Linnaeus in 1753, under _Vitis labrusca_, says: \"Leaves\r\ncordate, slightly tri-lobed, dentate, downy below.\" Marshall in 1785\r\nunder the name _Vitis vulpina_, or Fox grape, says: \"This in manner of\r\ngrowth hath much the appearance of the other kinds. The leaves are\r\ngenerally larger, and smooth, but whitish underneath. The fruit or\r\ngrapes are about the size of a common cherry and have a strong scent, a\r\nlittle approaching to that of a Fox, whence the name of Fox-grape. There\r\nare also varieties of this, some with whitish or reddish fruit which is\r\ngenerally most esteemed, and others with black, of which are our largest\r\ngrapes.\" From the time of Marshall on all of the botanists give more or\r\nless complete descriptions of this species and except for the brief\r\nmisunderstanding at first as to the name, its identity has never been\r\nquestioned. At one time it was supposed to grow in the Mississippi\r\nValley but Engelmann demonstrated that what were taken for Labrusca\r\nvines in Missouri were in reality strongly pubescent forms of\r\nAestivalis.\r\n\r\nLabrusca is indigenous to the eastern part of North America, including\r\nthe region between the Atlantic Ocean and the Alleghany Mountains. It is\r\nsometimes found in the valleys and along the western slopes of the\r\nAlleghanies. Many botanists say it is never found in the Mississippi\r\nValley; Munson reports specimens, however, from Indiana and Tennessee.\r\nIn the first-named area it ranges from Maine to Georgia. It has the most\r\nrestricted habitat of any American species of horticultural importance,\r\nbeing much exceeded in extent of territory by _Vitis rotundifolia_,\r\n_Vitis aestivalis_, and _Vitis riparia_.\r\n\r\nLabrusca has furnished more cultivated varieties, either pure-breeds or\r\nhybrids, than all other American species together. The reason for this\r\nis partly, no doubt, due to the fact that it is native to the portion of\r\nthe United States first settled and is the most common grape in the\r\nregion where agriculture first advanced to the condition where fruits\r\nwere desired. This does not wholly account for its prominence, however,\r\nwhich must be sought elsewhere. In its wild state Labrusca is probably\r\nthe most attractive to the eye of any of our American grapes on account\r\nof the size of its fruit, and this undoubtedly turned the attention of\r\nthose who were early interested in the possibilities of American\r\ngrape-growing to this species rather than to any other.\r\n\r\nThe southern Labrusca is quite different from the northern form and\r\nprobably demands different conditions for its successful growth; in the\r\nNorth at least two types of the species may be distinguished. Vines are\r\nfound in the woods of New England, which resemble Concord very closely\r\nin both vine and fruit, excepting that the grapes are much smaller in\r\nsize and more seedy. There is also the large-fruited, foxy Labrusca,\r\nusually with reddish berries, represented by such cultivated varieties\r\nas Northern Muscadine, Dracut Amber, Lutie and others. Labrusca is\r\npeculiar amongst American grapes in showing black-, white- and\r\nred-fruited forms of wild vines growing in the woods. Because of this\r\nvariability it is impossible to give the exact climatic and soil\r\nconditions best adapted to the species. It is reasonable to suppose,\r\nhowever, that the ideal conditions for this or any other species are not\r\nwidely different from those prevailing where the species is indigenous.\r\nIn the case of Labrusca this means that it is best adapted to humid\r\nclimates and that the temperature desired varies according to whether\r\nthe variety comes from the southern or northern form of the species.\r\n\r\nThe root system of Labrusca does not penetrate the soil deeply,[152] but\r\nit is said to succeed better in deep and clayey soils than\r\nAestivalis.[153] In the Southern and Middle States it does better on\r\neastern and northeastern slopes. As would be suspected from its original\r\nmarshy home, it endures an excess of water in the soil, and on the other\r\nhand requires more water for successful growing than Aestivalis or\r\nRiparia. In spite of its ability to withstand clayey soils, it seems to\r\nprefer loose, warm, well-drained sandy lands to all others. The French\r\ngrowers report that all varieties of this species show a marked\r\nantipathy to a limestone soil, the vines soon becoming affected with\r\nchlorosis when planted in soils of this nature. In corroboration of this\r\nStayman reports that it is not found growing native in clayey, limestone\r\nsoils. The Labruscas succeed very well in the North and fairly well in\r\nthe middle West, as far south as Arkansas, where they are raised on\r\naccount of their fruit qualities but here the vines are not nearly so\r\nvigorous and healthy as are those of other species. In Alabama they are\r\nreported to be generally unsatisfactory, and in Texas the vines are\r\nshort-lived, unhealthy, and generally unsatisfactory, particularly in\r\nthe dry regions. There are some exceptions to this, as, for instance, in\r\nthe Piedmont region of the Carolinas, where, owing to elevation or other\r\ncauses, the climate of a southern region is semi-northern in its\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOOT OF WYOMING]\r\n\r\nThe fruit of Labrusca is large and usually handsomely colored. The skin\r\nis thick, covering a layer of adhering flesh, which gives the impression\r\nof its being thicker than it actually is; it is variable in tenderness,\r\nsometimes tough, but in many of our cultivated varieties it is so tender\r\nas to be a detriment in that it is inclined to crack on the vines in\r\ncase of rain at ripening time, and the berries to crush in\r\ntransportation. The skin of this species usually has a peculiar aroma,\r\ngenerally spoken of as _foxy_, and a slightly acid, astringent taste.\r\nBeneath the skin there is a layer of juicy pulp, quite sweet and never\r\nshowing much acidity in ripe fruit. The center of the berry is occupied\r\nby rather dense pulp, more or less stringy, with considerable acid close\r\nto the seeds. Many people object to the foxy aroma of this species, but,\r\nnevertheless, the most popular American varieties are more or less foxy.\r\nAnalyses have shown that Labrusca fruit is generally characterized by a\r\nlow percentage of sugar and acid, the very sweet tasting fox grapes not\r\nshowing as high a sugar content as some of the disagreeably tart\r\nAestivalis and Riparia sorts. This, in addition to the foxiness which\r\nfurnishes an excess of aroma in the wine, has prevented Labrusca\r\nvarieties from becoming favorites with the wine-makers. Must from these\r\nvarieties is adapted only for the making of dry wines, and when making\r\nwines of any other class it is necessary to add sugar and water, the\r\nquantities being governed by the final product desired.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the strong points already enumerated, it may be said that\r\nLabrusca submits well to vineyard culture, is fairly vigorous and\r\ngenerally quite productive. It grows readily from cuttings and in point\r\nof hardiness is intermediate between Riparia, the hardiest of our\r\nAmerican species, and Aestivalis. The roots are soft and fleshy (for an\r\nAmerican grape) and in some localities quite subject to attacks of\r\nphylloxera. None of the varieties of Labrusca have ever been popular in\r\nFrance on this account. In the wild vines the fruit is inclined to drop\r\nfrom the vine when ripe. This defect is known as \"shattering\" or\r\n\"shelling\" among grape-growers and it is a serious weakness in certain\r\nvarieties of Labrusca. It is said to be more sensitive in its wild state\r\nto mildew and rot than any other American species[154] but the evidence\r\non this point does not seem to be wholly conclusive. In the South and in\r\nsome parts of the middle West the leaves of all varieties of Labrusca\r\nsunburn and shrivel in the latter part of the summer. The vines do not\r\nendure drouth as well as Aestivalis or Riparia and not nearly so well as\r\nRupestris. Pearson[155] reports that the Labruscas can be sprayed with\r\ncopper sulphate mixtures with much less danger to the leaves than can\r\nAestivalis.\r\n\r\n\r\n24. =VITIS VINIFERA= Linn.\r\n\r\n     =1.= Linnaeus, _Sp.

The roots are large, soft and spongy.\r\n     A very variable species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOOT OF _VITIS VINIFERA_]\r\n\r\nBotanists have never agreed as to whether _Vitis vinifera_ is a single\r\nspecies or a combination of two or more species which has been\r\ncultivated for so long that it is impossible to discover the original\r\nforms. The name, _Vitis vinifera_, is usually credited to Linnaeus\r\nthough it was used for this grape before Linnaeus' time by Bauhin and\r\npossibly by others. The description of Linnaeus accompanying the name is\r\nvery short, as follows: Leaves sinuately lobed, glabrous. Many of the\r\nearlier botanists, Tournefort for one, described numerous varieties as\r\nthough they were species. As a natural corollary of the uncertainty of\r\nthe botanical status of _Vitis vinifera_ the original habitat of the\r\nspecies is not positively known. De Candolle, as noted in the first part\r\nof this work, considered the region about the Caspian Sea as the\r\nprobable habitat of the Old World grape. There is but little doubt that\r\nthe original home of _Vitis vinifera_ is some place in western Asia.\r\nThere is strong corroborative evidence of this in the fact that the\r\nclimatic conditions under which the species flourishes are such as are\r\nthere found.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter in _The Grapes of New York_ has been devoted to this,\r\nthe Old World grape, and for a discussion of the horticultural\r\ncharacters of the species and of the efforts to cultivate it in America,\r\nthe reader is referred to that chapter.\r\n\r\nNeither American nor European writers agree as to the exact climate\r\ndesired by Vinifera for the reason, probably, that all of the varieties\r\nin this variable species do not desire the same conditions. There are\r\ncertain phases of climate, however, that are well agreed upon, as\r\nfollows: The species requires a warm, dry climate, and is more sensitive\r\nto change of temperature than our American species. Stayman, who had had\r\nconsiderable experience in raising Vinifera grapes in different places,\r\nsays: Vinifera \"will not endure much rain or grow on wet land. It is\r\nonly in a dry climate and on high rolling situations that it will\r\nsucceed, where there is not more than 31 inches of an annual rainfall\r\nand for the growing and maturing season 15 inches.\" So far as soil alone\r\nis concerned, the French growers tell us that it can be grown\r\nsuccessfully in a wide variety of soils, being much less particular in\r\nthis respect than our American species. They state that it will\r\nwithstand and grow successfully in soils so strongly impregnated with\r\nlime that any of the American sorts would succumb to chlorosis.\r\n\r\nThere are certain characters connected with the fruit of this species\r\nwhich are peculiar to it and are not found in any of our American sorts.\r\nFirst, the skin, which is attached very closely to the flesh and which\r\nis never astringent or acid, is of good flavor and can be eaten with the\r\nfruit. Second, the flesh is firm, yet tender, and uniform throughout,\r\ndiffering in this respect from any of our American sorts, which\r\nfrequently show a sweet, watery and tender pulp close to the skin with a\r\ntough and more or less acid core at the center. Third, the flavor is\r\npeculiarly sprightly, a quality known as _vinous_, because it\r\ncharacterizes this species. It may be said in this connection, however,\r\nthat many Americans, accustomed to American grapes, prefer the flavor of\r\nour native sorts to the vinous flavor of the Old World grape. Europeans\r\ninvariably, and Americans who live in Vinifera raising sections,\r\nusually, deem the Vinifera flavor greatly superior. Fourth, a strong\r\nadherence of the berry to the pedicel, the fruit never \"shattering\" or\r\n\"shelling\" from the cluster.\r\n\r\nVarieties of Vinifera have been selected for the making of wine through\r\nso many centuries that this species has become the first and great\r\nwine-making grape. Whatever the future may hold in store for American\r\ngrapes, there is no question but that at present the Viniferas are far\r\nsuperior to any native Americans for wine-making purposes, both as to\r\nquality in general and the number of kinds of wine which can be made.\r\n\r\nThe weak points of Vinifera are: First, an inability to withstand the\r\ncold of our winters. The different varieties of Vinifera undoubtedly\r\nvary considerably as to the exact amount of cold they will stand without\r\ninjury. All of them tried at this Station freeze to the ground even in\r\nthe mildest winters. Second, foliage particularly susceptible to the\r\nattack of mildew and fruit susceptible to the attack of black-rot.\r\nThird, they generally require a ripening season much longer than our\r\nclimate affords. Fourth, the roots are soft and spongy and very liable\r\nto the attack of phylloxera, though they apparently penetrate more\r\nreadily in dense clays and hard dry soils than any of our American\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn the various hybrids that have been made between American and Vinifera\r\nvarieties it is usually found that the desirable qualities of Vinifera\r\nare taken in about the same proportion as the undesirable ones. The\r\nfruit is improved in the hybrid but the vine is weakened. Quality is\r\npurchased at the expense of hardiness and disease-resisting power.\r\nVinifera may be grown very readily from cuttings. This is of little\r\ncultural importance, however, as both in Europe and America varieties of\r\nthe species are usually grafted on phylloxera-resistant stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE LEADING VARIETIES OF AMERICAN GRAPES\r\n\r\n\r\nADIRONDAC.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera?)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mag.

It is probably\r\na seedling of Isabella which it greatly resembles in vine and fruit\r\ncharacters. It is of the Labrusca type, belonging to the southern group\r\nof this species, and like most of the southern Labruscas lacks in\r\nhardiness and vigor though it surpasses its parent in the first quality.\r\nThe vine makes a slow, weak growth and is particularly susceptible to\r\nfungi. The quality of the fruit is very good, juicy and vinous, with the\r\nslight foxy flavor peculiar to Isabella. Its earliness, a week or ten\r\ndays earlier than Concord, is one of its chief points of merit. The\r\nAdirondac did not attain favor because of the many faults of the vine\r\nand in the time of its cultivation was seldom found except in the\r\nvineyard of the amateur. The claim is often made for this variety that\r\nit is nearer the Black Hamburg in quality than any other American grape.\r\n\r\nAdirondac was first exhibited by J. W. Bailey of Plattsburg, New York,\r\nat the Montreal Horticultural Society Exhibition in Montreal in 1861.\r\nThe original vine was found in 1852 by J. G. Witherbee in his garden a\r\nshort distance from the shore of Lake Champlain in the town of Port\r\nHenry, Essex County, New York. The variety was introduced by Bailey. On\r\naccount of its resemblance in vine to Isabella it is supposed by many to\r\nbe a seedling of that variety. Adirondac was placed on the grape list of\r\nthe American Pomological Society in 1867 and was dropped from it in\r\n1883.\r\n\r\n     Vine variable in vigor and productiveness, injured in severe\r\n     winters, subject to attacks of mildew in unfavorable seasons.\r\n     Foliage dark green, thick. Flowers semi-fertile, open in mid-season\r\n     or earlier; stamens upright. Fruit variable in season of ripening,\r\n     usually in edible condition about ten days before Delaware, does\r\n     not always keep well. Clusters above medium to small, usually\r\n     rather compact, seldom shouldered. Berries not uniform in size\r\n     averaging below Concord, roundish to slightly oval on account of\r\n     compactness of cluster, dark purplish-black, persistent. Skin\r\n     intermediate in thickness. Flesh unusually tender and melting,\r\n     sweet, mild, good to very good but with an after flavor which is\r\n     not altogether agreeable. Seeds rather large, few in number. Must\r\n     82-1/2°-83°.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCE.\r\n\r\n(Riparia, Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mass. Hort. Soc. Rpt._, =1872=:94. =2.= _U. S. D. A.

At the time of its introduction (1872) it was of much\r\ninterest as a hybrid between Riparia, Labrusca and Vinifera, Clinton\r\nbeing one parent and Duke of Magenta, a grape resembling Black Hamburg,\r\nthe other. In quality of fruit it is an improvement over Clinton but\r\nunfortunately, as with so many primary hybrids of our native species\r\nwith _Vitis vinifera_, the vine is tender and susceptible to fungi.\r\n\r\nThis variety was produced by J. H. Ricketts of Newburgh, New York, and\r\nwas first exhibited at the grape show in New York City in 1870.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, productive, not very hardy, subject to attacks of\r\n     mildew. Canes long, covered with considerable blue bloom. Leaves\r\n     rather large, thin, dark green. Fruit ripens in mid-season, appears\r\n     to keep well.

It has the distinction of being the only\r\nself-fertile variety among Rogers' named hybrids. For a grape having its\r\nproportion of European parentage the vine is vigorous, hardy and\r\nproductive, though not equal to many pure-bred American sorts in these\r\nrespects. In severe winters it is precariously hardy in New York. Its\r\nchief defects in fruit are a somewhat thick and tough skin, coarse solid\r\ntexture of pulp, and, for the European palate, its decidedly foxy\r\nflavor. The vine is susceptible to the mildews and in many localities\r\ndoes not yield well. In some markets Agawam is highly esteemed and in\r\nmaking certain wines it is much sought for in blending because of the\r\nflavor it imparts. Although it ripens soon after Concord it can be kept\r\nmuch longer and really improves in flavor the first few weeks after\r\npicking. It may be kept in good condition in common storage until\r\nJanuary. Not uncommonly it shrivels on the stem making a raisin. It\r\nseems to prefer somewhat heavy soils, doing better on clay than on sand\r\nor gravel. The Agawam is often sold in the markets as Salem which it\r\nresembles and by which it is surpassed in quality.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the parentage and origin of Agawam see \"Rogers'\r\nHybrids\" of which this is No. 15. It was first mentioned as a variety\r\nabout 1861. In 1869 Rogers gave the fruit the name Agawam from the\r\nIndian name of a town in Hampden County, Massachusetts. It has become\r\none of the most, if not the most, popular of Rogers' hybrids and is in\r\nsome sections raised to a considerable extent as a market sort. It is\r\npropagated and sold to-day by practically all nurserymen. It was placed\r\non the grape list of the American Pomological Society fruit catalog in\r\n1867 and is still retained there.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, usually hardy, medium to productive, subject to\r\n     mildew. Canes of average length, medium in number, rather thick,\r\n     moderately dark brown; nodes enlarged, somewhat flattened;\r\n     internodes short to medium; diaphragm nearly thick; pith of average\r\n     size; shoots tinged with green, glabrous; tendrils intermittent to\r\n     continuous, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds open in mid-season, of average size, long, somewhat\r\n     thick, conical to nearly obtuse. Young leaves tinged with carmine\r\n     on lower side and along margin of upper side, prevailing color pale\r\n     green. Leaves of average size, thick; upper surface light green,\r\n     dull, moderately smooth; lower surface pale green, slightly\r\n     pubescent, flocculent; leaf not lobed, terminus somewhat acute;\r\n     petiolar sinus deep, narrow, often overlapping; lateral sinus very\r\n     shallow when present; teeth shallow, wide. Flowers occasionally on\r\n     plan of six, nearly self-fertile, open medium late; stamens\r\n     upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens soon after Concord, keeps until mid-winter. Clusters\r\n     variable averaging medium to large, short, rather broad, tapering\r\n     to somewhat cylindrical, sometimes single-shouldered, somewhat\r\n     loose; peduncle medium to short, nearly thick; pedicel of average\r\n     length, usually thick, covered with few warts, much enlarged at\r\n     point of attachment; brush very short, pale green. Berries nearly\r\n     large, roundish to slightly oval, dark and dull purplish-red\r\n     somewhat resembling Catawba, covered with lilac bloom, very\r\n     persistent. Skin thick, tough, adheres slightly to the pulp,\r\n     contains no pigment, somewhat astringent. Flesh pale green,\r\n     translucent, tough, slightly stringy, rather solid, foxy, good in\r\n     quality. Seeds somewhat adherent, two to five averaging four,\r\n     large, rather narrow, long, often with slightly enlarged neck,\r\n     blunt, brownish; raphe usually distinct, shows as a ridge in the\r\n     bottom of a broad groove; chalaza rather large, distinctly above\r\n     center, not obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera?)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Dom.

We have seen in the\r\npreceding chapters how important a part it had in the evolution of our\r\nnative grapes, being one of the first wild grapes to be domesticated.\r\nThe Alexander was a coarse grape with so much foxiness of flavor that\r\nit did not please the early growers, who had been accustomed to European\r\nsorts, as a table-grape, but it made a very good wine of the claret type\r\nand was grown for this purpose until displaced by the Catawba. It was\r\nwine made from this variety that Thomas Jefferson[157] pronounced\r\n\"worthy of the best vineyards of France.\" The early writers differ so in\r\ntheir estimates of the good and bad qualities of this grape that it is\r\nhard to give its true characters at this late date.\r\n\r\nThe early history of Alexander is really the history of two varieties:\r\nthe Schuylkill Muscadel and the Clifton Constantia. The first of these\r\nvarieties was, according to Bartram, found growing in the vicinity of\r\nPhiladelphia on the hills bordering the Schuylkill River in the\r\nneighborhood of an old vineyard of European grapes. The finder, John\r\nAlexander, was gardener to Governor Penn of Pennsylvania, into whose\r\ngarden he introduced it a few years before the American Revolution. It\r\nwas later known as Tasker's grape from a Mr. Tasker of Maryland who\r\ncultivated it largely. The Clifton Constantia, according to Adlum,\r\noriginated with William Clifton of Southwark, Philadelphia, who states\r\nthat it was a chance seedling in his garden. Adlum says that the two\r\nvarieties had been confused, that \"they are much alike in the growth of\r\nthe vine and the color of the grape but the Schuylkill has rather the\r\nlargest berries and is sweeter, and generally has a small shoulder or\r\nbranch with four or five grapes on it growing out from the top of the\r\nbunch.\" Prince also describes the varieties as separate, but he says\r\n\"they are generally cultivated and considered as synonymous.\" Later\r\nwriters consider the two grapes identical.\r\n\r\nPeter Legaux, the promoter of a vineyard company at Spring Mill, about\r\nfourteen miles from Philadelphia, secured some vines of the Clifton\r\nConstantia from Clifton and later introduced it under the name of Cape\r\ngrape stating that he had secured it from the Cape of Good Hope. Whether\r\nhe did this purposely and with intent to defraud or whether he had\r\naccidentally mixed the cuttings secured from Clifton with some of a\r\nlarge number of cuttings which had come from abroad will never be known.\r\nWhen reproached for his deception he denied that this variety was a\r\nnative and continued to assert that he had secured it from the Cape of\r\nGood Hope. In this he was strongly supported by Dufour who says: \"I will\r\nalso try to save the character of our Cape grapes from being merely wild\r\ngrapes, because some are now found in the woods.\" Legaux's advertisement\r\nof this variety had the effect of making it known at least and it is the\r\nopinion of writers of that day that many were induced to try this grape\r\nunder the supposition that it was from the Cape of Good Hope who would\r\nhave scorned it had they supposed it to be a native. It came to be\r\nconsiderably planted in all parts of the United States; was early\r\nintroduced into the West and preceded the Catawba as the popular grape\r\naround Cincinnati. It was found worthless in New England and New York,\r\nthe season not being long enough to mature the fruit. With the\r\nintroduction and dissemination of Catawba it was gradually dropped from\r\ncultivation, the Catawba being superior in quality, more resistant to\r\nrot and mildew and slightly earlier. It is now unknown and it is\r\ndoubtful if there are any living vines in cultivation.\r\n\r\nAlexander is generally considered a variety of Labrusca but there is\r\nmuch evidence to show that it is a hybrid of Labrusca and Vinifera. This\r\nwas the opinion of some of the earlier writers but later it was\r\ndiscredited. Bartram gives as one of the distinguishing characters of\r\nVinifera and American vines that the first show oval berries while the\r\nlatter do not, but he makes an exception of Alexander. Why this should\r\nbe an exception does not seem apparent unless it be credited to\r\nhybridity. Furthermore, the season of Alexander, which is very late,\r\nwould also indicate foreign blood; a grape native of the vicinity of\r\nPhiladelphia would supposedly be able to ripen itself in that locality,\r\na thing that the Alexander seldom did perfectly, and it is spoken of in\r\nsouthern Indiana as being very late. Its place of origin (\"in the\r\nvicinity of an old vineyard of European kinds\") would indicate that\r\nthere was an opportunity for hybridization to take place. The\r\ndescriptions strongly suggest some of the coarser-textured of Rogers'\r\nhybrids.\r\n\r\nThis solution, if it be accepted, would account for the difference of\r\nopinion as to its origin. Bartram and Prince could see enough of the\r\ncharacters of the native in a hybrid so that they could be deceived into\r\nclaiming it as a native, and Dufour on the other hand could see enough\r\nof the Vinifera characters so that he felt there was no question as to\r\nits being of foreign origin.\r\n\r\nDowning gives what is probably the most complete description of this\r\nvariety we now have, although it was made from fruit raised some\r\ndistance farther north than where the variety matures properly. He says:\r\n\"It is quite sweet when ripe and makes a very fair wine but it is quite\r\ntoo pulpy and coarse for table use. The bunches are more compact and the\r\nleaves much more _downy_ than those of the Isabella. Bunches rather\r\ncompact, not shouldered. Berries of medium size, oval. Skin thick, quite\r\nblack. Flesh with a very firm pulp, but juicy, and quite sweet and\r\nmusky, when fully ripe, which is not till the last of October.\" Dufour\r\nspeaks of the berries ripening unevenly, requiring the green ones to be\r\npicked out before sending to the wine press.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER WINTER.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera?)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _N. Y. Sta. An. Rpt._, =11=:613. 1892. =2.= _Ib._, =14=:275.\r\n     1895. =3.= _Ib._, =17=:526, 548, 553. 1898.\r\n\r\nAlexander Winter is chiefly valuable because of the length of time it\r\nwill keep. As its name implies it is a _winter_ grape. The flavor is\r\nmost excellent and when well grown the appearance of bunch and grape is\r\nattractive. Another desirable quality is that the average number of\r\nseeds to the berry is small, being only two. The great defect of the\r\nvariety is that, even with cross-pollinization, perfect clusters do not\r\nform. There are many green berries, and when ripe there are always some\r\nsmall seedless berries indicating imperfect fertilization. Vine and\r\nfoliage indicate Labrusca parentage but the fruit suggests an admixture\r\nof Vinifera. Although rarely found in the gardens and vineyards of New\r\nYork, Alexander Winter is well worth a place in the garden of the\r\namateur and of the grape-breeder because of its excellent keeping\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nAlexander Winter was originated by S. R. Alexander, Bellefontaine, Ohio,\r\nfrom a lot of mixed seed planted in 1884. It was received at this\r\nStation in 1892. It seems not to have been tested elsewhere and is not\r\ngenerally handled by nurserymen.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, injured in severe winters, productive. Foliage\r\n     irregularly roundish, dark green. Flowers open in mid-season or\r\n     earlier; stamens reflexed. It cannot be relied upon to set perfect\r\n     clusters when standing alone and even when growing in a mixed\r\n     vineyard fails to set fruit well. Fruit ripens about with Salem,\r\n     keeps a long time in edible condition. Clusters above medium to\r\n     small, very heavily shouldered, loose, contain many small seedless\r\n     fruits. Berries variable in size, the fully developed fruits\r\n     averaging medium to large, roundish, dull, light and dark red,\r\n     covered with thin lilac bloom or at times with faint tinge of\r\n     grayish-blue, persistent. Skin covered with scattering dark-colored\r\n     dots, rather thick but tender. Flesh tender, vinous, with\r\n     indications of Vinifera parentage, sweetish to agreeably tart,\r\n     flavor pleasing, good to very good in quality. Seeds large, few in\r\n     number; raphe sometimes shows as a raised cord.\r\n\r\n\r\n(I) ALICE.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Bush.

This grape is a white seedling of Martha, and much\r\nresembles that variety. It was originated by J. A. Putnam, Fredonia, New\r\nYork, who writes that the vine was first fruited in 1890. On account of\r\nits close resemblance to Martha it was generally considered unworthy of\r\nperpetuation and is now practically obsolete.\r\n\r\n\r\n(II) ALICE.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Aestivalis?, Vinifera?)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Rural N.

The grape is of little value in New York.\r\n\r\nThis variety was found growing near an old stone wall by Ward D. Gunn of\r\nClintondale, Ulster County, New York, and was transplanted into his\r\nvineyard in the spring of 1884. It was introduced by F. E. Young of\r\nRochester. This is a Labrusca, with a few characters that indicate\r\nAestivalis and Vinifera blood.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to medium, hardy, produces fair crops. Leaves medium\r\n     to large, sometimes strongly rugose, with lower surface heavily\r\n     pubescent. Flowers self-fertile or nearly so, open in mid-season;\r\n     stamens upright. Fruit ripens with Concord or slightly earlier, the\r\n     different clusters varying in season of ripening, ships well and\r\n     keeps in good condition far into the winter. Clusters intermediate\r\n     in size, usually with a small single shoulder, medium to compact.\r\n     Berries above medium to small, roundish although frequently\r\n     strongly compressed on account of compactness of cluster, rather\r\n     dull, pale red, somewhat lighter than Catawba, covered with thin\r\n     lilac bloom, persistent. Skin very thick. Flesh tender, vinous,\r\n     somewhat foxy, sweet at skin to agreeably tart at center, good in\r\n     quality, resembling Diana or Catawba. The seeds, which are few in\r\n     number, often show a rough granular, warty surface around the\r\n     chalaza.\r\n\r\n\r\nALLEN'S HYBRID.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mag.

Bul._, =53=:40. 1901.\r\n\r\nA half century ago Allen's Hybrid was the vine of promise in America. It\r\nwas the first named hybrid between _Vitis labrusca_ and _Vitis vinifera_\r\nto be disseminated and as such awakened the slumbering hopes of the\r\nhorticulturists of a continent. American grape-growers had all but given\r\nup the expectation of ever growing the European grape in the New World\r\nwhen Allen announced this hybrid. Auspicious hope! Grape-growers\r\neverywhere hybridized grapes and the growing of the vine received an\r\nimpetus surpassed only by that of the introduction of the Concord.\r\nBotanists and horticulturists had doubted the possibility and the\r\npracticability of crossing the Old World grape with the New World\r\nspecies, when this variety removed the doubt and led them to hope that\r\nwe were to have varieties of grapes in America possessing many of the\r\ncoveted characters of the grapes of Europe.\r\n\r\nAfter its introduction the variety was tested wherever grapes were grown\r\nin the United States and Canada,--and for a generation. Its high\r\nquality, entirely free from what was then considered objectionable\r\nfoxiness, handsome appearance, with some other qualities of its Vinifera\r\nparent, at first indicated that it was a most valuable acquisition; but\r\nit soon developed the tenderness of vine and susceptibility to fungi and\r\ninsects which have come to be the distinguishing marks of the primary\r\nhybrids of native species and the European grape. Its cultivation has\r\nlong since ceased and it has now a place only in the history of American\r\ngrape-growing. It has been one of the parents of a number of other\r\ngrapes, chief of which is Lady Washington, produced from a cross between\r\nAllen's Hybrid and Concord. The grape is lost to cultivation but the\r\nname should be perpetuated as commemorating one of the great events in\r\nAmerican viticulture.\r\n\r\nAllen's Hybrid was originated by John Fiske Allen of Salem,\r\nMassachusetts. In the winter of 1843-44 he fertilized the blossoms of an\r\nIsabella vine growing in a greenhouse with pollen from Chasselas de\r\nFontainbleau. Seeds were produced and planted the next year the vines of\r\nwhich began to fruit in 1853 and 1854. One of these seedlings of greater\r\nmerit than the others was saved and named Allen's Hybrid; the others\r\nwere destroyed.\r\n\r\n     \"The vine is not hardy, and requires winter protection, but is\r\n     vigorous and productive, ripening quite early, and in sheltered\r\n     situations is a desirable variety. Bunch medium to large,\r\n     shouldered, compact; berry medium to large, round, sometimes\r\n     depressed; skin thin, white, changing to pale yellow when fully\r\n     ripe; flesh tender, juicy, sweet, rich, with a delicate slightly\r\n     vinous flavor, and one of the best in quality.\"[158]\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBER QUEEN.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Riparia, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mass.

The fruit strongly indicates the\r\nVinifera parentage, the continuous tendrils Labrusca, and the vine, in\r\nvigor of growth and several botanical characters, shows its descent from\r\nRiparia. The variety has never been much grown, and when cultivated\r\ncould be best characterized by its faults--of not setting fruit well,\r\nsusceptibility to mildew and black-rot and of unproductiveness. It is,\r\nhowever, reasonably successful in especially favorable localities.\r\n\r\nThe variety was first exhibited at a meeting of the Massachusetts\r\nHorticultural Society in 1870. It was originated by N. B. White,\r\nNorwood, Massachusetts, from seed of Marion fertilized with Black\r\nHamburg. Bush questions this parentage owing to the fact that Amber\r\nQueen frequently shows continuous tendrils. In the vineyard of this\r\nStation, however, Marion shows continuous as well as intermittent\r\ntendrils, indicating that it would be quite possible for the Amber Queen\r\nto have inherited its aberrant tendrils from that source.\r\n\r\n     Vine a strong grower, usually hardy, produces light crops except in\r\n     favored locations, both leaves and fruit subject to attacks of\r\n     fungal diseases. Leaves above medium size, roundish, rather thick.\r\n     Flowers sterile or nearly so, practically incapable of setting\r\n     fruit when self-fertilized, open about in mid-season and bloom a\r\n     long time; stamens reflexed. Fruit variable in season of ripening,\r\n     sometimes before, at other times after Concord, usually requires\r\n     more than one picking to secure the fruit at its best, does not\r\n     keep well as the berries soon wither. Clusters variable in size but\r\n     not large, usually loose and open but sometimes compact. Berries\r\n     not uniform in size, roundish to oval, dark red covered with more\r\n     or less lilac bloom, somewhat resembling Catawba in color, not very\r\n     firm as the berries soon shrivel, persistent. Flesh very juicy,\r\n     soft and tender, mildly sweet at skin to acid at center, good to\r\n     very good in quality. Seeds variable in size, frequently with\r\n     enlarged neck; chalaza distinctly above center.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBROSIA.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _N. Y. Sta. An.

In quality, while\r\nhardly worthy of its name, it ranks high and for this reason may be\r\nworth a place in the vineyard of the amateur. On the Station grounds it\r\nshells badly, differing in this respect from its supposed parent Salem.\r\n\r\nThe variety was originated by Alfred Rose of Penn Yan, New York, from\r\nseed of Salem, planted in 1884. It was received for testing by this\r\nStation in 1888. There are no records of its having been tested\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, healthy, usually hardy, moderately productive.\r\n     Leaves intermediate in size; lower surface heavily tinged with\r\n     bronze. Flowers occasionally on plan of six, fertile, open in\r\n     mid-season or earlier; stamens upright. Fruit ripens about with\r\n     Concord or Delaware, appears to keep well. Clusters large to\r\n     medium, broadly and irregularly tapering, sometimes blunt at ends,\r\n     usually not shouldered or shoulder when present small and short,\r\n     compact to medium. Berries large to above medium, slightly oblate,\r\n     attractive green changing to a yellow tinge, covered with a more or\r\n     less gray bloom, drop from clusters easily. Flesh rather\r\n     transparent and tender, mild, sweetish from skin to center,\r\n     pleasant-flavored but somewhat variable in flavor and quality,\r\n     ranking from medium to very good. Seeds separate readily from the\r\n     pulp, quite large; raphe often shows as a partly submerged cord.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA.\r\n\r\n(Lincecumii, Rupestris.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _N. Y. Sta. An.

It may also be worth\r\ngrowing in a limited way in this State for wine-making as it is reputed\r\nby all who have tried it to be one of the best native grapes for a dark\r\nred wine and to make a very good port. The notable qualities of the\r\nvariety as it grows at Geneva are: Vigor of growth, health of foliage,\r\npersistence of berries, high sugar content and the peculiar flavor of\r\nthe fruit, liked by some and not by others. At least it can be said that\r\nthe taste of America is new to northern grape-growers; and, since it\r\nwholly lacks the foxy taste and aroma of Labrusca, it offers\r\npossibilities for breeding varieties lacking the distinguishing flavor\r\nof Concord and Niagara. This variety would probably be somewhat\r\nobjectionable in northern markets as a table fruit because of the highly\r\ncolored juice, which stains the hands and the lips. The flavor is\r\ndecidedly that of _Vitis rupestris_.\r\n\r\nIts originator claims for America great resistance to heat and cold; and\r\nour experience, though limited, confirms the claim. So, too, it is said\r\nto be a suitable stock upon which to graft Vinifera varieties to resist\r\nphylloxera, a matter concerning which our experience in this region\r\noffers nothing, though the parentage strongly suggests such resistance\r\nto be the case. The vigor of the vine and the luxuriance of the foliage,\r\nprobably still more marked farther south, cannot but make it an\r\nexcellent sort for arbors. But the fact must be emphasized that America\r\nis preeminently of interest to the northern grape-grower because it\r\ngives him an opportunity to make use in breeding work, of the qualities\r\nof Rupestris and Lincecumii, southern species combined in this variety\r\nand thriving in the combination in northern conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICA]\r\n\r\nThe grape described here was originated by Munson from seed of _Jaeger\r\nNo. 43_ pollinated by a male Rupestris. It was received at this Station\r\nin 1892 which was practically the date of its introduction. America has\r\nbeen widely tested by experiment stations and the reports of its\r\nbehavior are generally favorable.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to very vigorous, usually hardy, produces heavy\r\n     crops. Canes long, numerous, of medium size, dark reddish-brown,\r\n     covered with heavy blue bloom; nodes enlarged, strongly flattened;\r\n     internodes of average length; diaphragm medium in thickness; pith\r\n     rather large; shoots glabrous, covered with blue bloom; tendrils\r\n     intermittent; long, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds open in mid-season, medium to small, of average length,\r\n     rather thick, conical to obtuse. Young leaves tinged on both sides,\r\n     making the prevailing color rose-carmine. Leaves healthy, inferior\r\n     in size, rather thin; upper surface attractive medium green,\r\n     glossy, smooth; lower surface light green, hairy; veins indistinct;\r\n     lobes lacking or faintly showing, terminal lobe acute; petiolar\r\n     sinus moderately deep and wide; teeth of average depth and width.\r\n     Flowers sterile, usually on plan of six, open late; stamens\r\n     reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens with Concord or later, keeps well. Clusters nearly\r\n     large, above medium length, broad, tapering, somewhat cylindrical,\r\n     irregular, usually single-shouldered, averaging two or three\r\n     bunches per shoot, usually compact; peduncle of medium length,\r\n     rather thick; pedicel short, slender, covered with few, small,\r\n     inconspicuous warts; brush short, thick, with reddish tinge.\r\n     Berries medium to small, variable in size, roundish, attractive\r\n     black or purplish-black, glossy, covered with heavy blue bloom,\r\n     persistent, somewhat soft. Skin thin, very tender, adheres slightly\r\n     to the pulp, contains an unusually large amount of purplish-red\r\n     pigment, slightly astringent. Flesh dull white with faint reddish\r\n     tinge, translucent, not very juicy, tender, not stringy, melting,\r\n     spicy, vinous, sweet, good in quality. Seeds separate easily, two\r\n     to five, average four, above medium size, long, of moderate width,\r\n     pointed, yellowish-brown; raphe prominent, cord-like; chalaza\r\n     large, slightly above center, irregularly circular, distinct.\r\n\r\nThere is a second variety under the name America, as Ricketts years ago\r\nintroduced an America which has probably passed from cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMETHYST.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera, Bourquiniana.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt._, =1903=:82.\r\n\r\nAmethyst is one of Munson's hybrids as yet unknown to the grape-growers\r\nof New York. It is a most excellent table grape, coming after the\r\nDelaware which it much resembles in habit of growth and in fruit. It is\r\na stronger grower than Delaware, has proved to be as hardy, is seemingly\r\nnot attacked readily by black-rot, but like the Delaware is susceptible\r\nto mildew. In quality it ranks with Delago, Brilliant, Goethe, Lindley\r\nand Delaware, all parents one or two generations removed. According to\r\nMunson it makes a good white wine. It is at least an amateur's grape, to\r\nbe sought because of high quality. It was originated by T. V. Munson of\r\nDenison, Texas, being first fruited in 1898. It is a cross of Delago and\r\nBrilliant and was introduced in 1902.\r\n\r\n     Vine moderately vigorous, hardy, medium to productive, susceptible\r\n     to attacks of mildew. Canes intermediate in length, number and\r\n     thickness, light and dark brown deepening in color at the nodes.\r\n     Leaves medium to nearly large, light green; lower surface pale\r\n     green, pubescent. Flowers nearly fertile to slightly sterile, open\r\n     rather late; stamens upright. Fruit ripens after Delaware, keeps\r\n     well. Clusters medium to large, intermediate in length and width,\r\n     usually single-shouldered, compact. Berries above medium to small,\r\n     roundish to oval, strongly narrowing toward the pedicel on account\r\n     of compactness of cluster, rather attractive dark red, covered with\r\n     lilac bloom, usually persistent. Skin thick, of average toughness.\r\n     Flesh rather tough, solid, vinous, sweetish at skin to agreeably\r\n     tart at center somewhat resembling Brilliant, good to very good in\r\n     quality. Seeds intermediate in size and length, often with enlarged\r\n     neck.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMINIA.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mag. Hort._, =31=:333. 1865. =2.= _Mass. Hort. Soc.

Besides being early and of good quality it keeps\r\nwell. It ripens with or a little after Moore Early and Hartford,\r\nproducing berries of high quality and attractive appearance but the\r\nbunches are small, variable in size, not well formed as a rule, and the\r\nberries ripen unevenly. The vine is vigorous, not as hardy as might be\r\nwished for in New York, nor as productive as a commercial variety must\r\nbe, and shows the weaknesses characteristic of all of Rogers' hybrids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMINIA]\r\n\r\nFor an account of the origin of the Aminia see page 390 under \"Rogers'\r\nHybrids.\" In 1867 Bush secured vines of _Rogers' No. 39_ from several\r\ndifferent sources. When these came into bearing he found he had three\r\ndifferent varieties. The original vine of _Rogers' No. 39_ having been\r\ndestroyed it was impossible to determine which was the correct one. Bush\r\nselected the best of these and to avoid further confusion, with the\r\nconsent of Rogers, named it Aminia. But in spite of Bush's care there\r\nare still at least two different varieties cultivated under this name.\r\nAlthough the Aminia is found in many varietal vineyards, an examination\r\nof over forty of the leading grape nurserymen's catalogs shows only\r\nthree who offer vines for sale.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, not always hardy, lacking somewhat in\r\n     productiveness. Canes slightly rough, long, medium in number,\r\n     thickish, dark brown to reddish tinge; nodes enlarged, usually not\r\n     flattened; internodes medium to long; diaphragm somewhat thick;\r\n     pith large; shoots pubescent; tendrils intermittent, long to\r\n     medium, trifid to bifid, persistent.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds open in mid-season, about medium in size and length,\r\n     above average thickness, prominent, obtuse to conical. Young leaves\r\n     colored on both sides, prevailing color rather bright carmine.\r\n     Leaves large, of average thickness; upper surface medium green,\r\n     rather dull, nearly smooth; lower surface light green, slightly\r\n     pubescent; veins distinct; lobes usually three, terminal lobe\r\n     acute; petiolar sinus rather deep, narrow, often closed and\r\n     overlapping; basal sinus usually lacking; lateral sinus nearly\r\n     shallow, narrow; teeth somewhat shallow, inclined to wide. Flowers\r\n     open in mid-season, sterile; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens early, just after Hartford, keeps well. Clusters\r\n     medium to small, of average length, broad, irregular, somewhat\r\n     conical, sometimes with a long shoulder, rather loose; peduncle\r\n     long, thick; pedicel longish, not slender, broad at point of\r\n     attachment, covered with few warts; brush short, thick,\r\n     brownish-red. Berries range from large to small, decidedly\r\n     variable, roundish, dull black, covered with blue bloom,\r\n     persistent, firm. Skin rather thick, somewhat tender, adheres\r\n     considerably to the pulp, contains a large amount of purplish-red\r\n     pigment, slightly astringent. Flesh greenish, translucent,\r\n     moderately tender, rather solid and coarse, foxy, sweet at skin but\r\n     somewhat acid at center; quality good.

It is very similar to the several other white seedlings\r\nof Concord, all of which have a decided varietal resemblance and which,\r\nexcept in color of fruit, have the general characters of Concord.\r\n\r\nT. B. Miner, of New Jersey, produced Antoinette from Concord seed over\r\nthirty years ago.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, usually hardy, fairly productive.

In appearance of berry and in\r\ntaste, when well grown, August Giant greatly resembles Black Hamburg.\r\nThe vine is unusually vigorous and, considering its parentage, is quite\r\nhardy. The foliage is thick and luxuriant, though somewhat subject to\r\nmildew. The vigor of vine, beauty of foliage, and the high quality of\r\nthe fruit make the variety a desirable one for the amateur, especially\r\nwhere an ornamental vine is wanted. The variety needs to be grown where\r\nthe fruit can have a long and favorable maturing season.\r\n\r\nAugust Giant was originated by N. B. White of Norwood, Massachusetts, in\r\n1861 from seed of an early, large-berried red grape of the Labrusca\r\ntype, pollinated by Black Hamburg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUGUST GIANT]\r\n\r\n     Vine very vigorous, usually hardy, not a heavy bearer, somewhat\r\n     subject to mildew. Canes medium to long, numerous, thick, light to\r\n     dark brown; nodes enlarged, slightly flattened; internodes below\r\n     average length; diaphragm rather thick; pith large to medium;\r\n     shoots slightly pubescent; tendrils continuous, medium to long,\r\n     bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds open in mid-season, of average size, short, rather thick,\r\n     conical to obtuse. Young leaves tinged with carmine on lower side\r\n     extending beyond border of upper side. Leaves medium to very large,\r\n     thick; upper surface dark green, glossy, smooth, slightly rugose on\r\n     older leaves; lower surface pale green to indistinct bronze,\r\n     pubescent; veins rather indistinct; lobes usually three, terminal\r\n     lobe acute; petiolar sinus medium to deep, narrow, frequently\r\n     closed and overlapping; lateral sinus shallow to a mere notch;\r\n     teeth shallow, narrow. Flowers open in mid-season, sterile; stamens\r\n     reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens about a week later than Moore Early, keeps well.\r\n     Clusters of average size or sometimes larger, medium to short,\r\n     rather broad, irregularly tapering, not uniform, usually\r\n     single-shouldered, loose to nearly compact; peduncle long to medium\r\n     in length, somewhat thick; pedicel longish, thick, wide at\r\n     attachment to berry, covered with numerous large warts; brush\r\n     short, thick, greenish or with brown tinge. Berries resemble Black\r\n     Hamburg in general appearance but somewhat variable, averaging\r\n     large, oval to roundish, dark purplish-red or black, dull, covered\r\n     with thick blue bloom, hang well to pedicel, firm. Skin of average\r\n     thickness, tough, adheres slightly to pulp, contains a small amount\r\n     of bright red pigment, strongly astringent.

It was heralded as\r\nthe \"best white grape in America--a veritable treasure.\" Later it was\r\ngrown and somewhat widely tested in France. But in neither country has\r\nit come up to expectations. In America it has proved to be somewhat\r\ntender to cold, an unreliable bearer and subject to rot and mildew. In\r\nFrance it shows the same weaknesses and is not as resistant to\r\nphylloxera as are other and better American sorts. The quality of\r\nAutuchon is excellent, being that of its European parent with the\r\nagreeable sprightliness of its American ancestor. According to the\r\nreports regarding it from France it makes a \"wine remarkably white,\r\nvinous and fresh, slightly musky and agreeable, and of a beautiful\r\nyellow color.\"[159]\r\n\r\nAutuchon was originated by Charles Arnold of Paris, Canada, from seed\r\nplanted in 1859, The parents are Clinton pollinated by Golden Chasselas.\r\nIt is not in the Station collection, and the following description is\r\ntaken from the _Bushberg Catalogue_.[160]\r\n\r\n     \"Leaves dark green, very deep lobed and sharp pointed serratures;\r\n     the unripe wood is very dark purple, nearly black. Bunches very\r\n     long, not heavily shouldered, rather loose; berries medium size,\r\n     round, white (green), with a moderately firm, but readily melting\r\n     flesh, and an agreeable sprightly flavor, resembling the White\r\n     Chasselas.

It is an offspring of Clinton which it much\r\nresembles in vine and leaf characters but surpasses in quality of fruit\r\nand in productiveness. In New York Bacchus has very generally superseded\r\nClinton though neither is extensively grown. It is vigorous, productive,\r\nhardy, free from mildew and adapted to a variety of soils; it requires a\r\nlong season for full maturity and cannot therefore be well grown in\r\nnorthern locations though the seasons in the grape regions of New York\r\nare usually sufficiently long. The wine-makers of the State mention it\r\nas one of the most desirable grapes for a dark red wine. While it is\r\ngenerally too tart for a dessert grape, yet if left on the vine until\r\nfrost, as late as it can hang, it becomes a good late table grape.\r\nBacchus is one of the best, if not the best, cultivated types of\r\nRiparia, or of the Clinton group of Riparia. Its special points of merit\r\nfrom a broad standpoint are: Resistance to cold, resistance to\r\nphylloxera, value for wine-making, freedom from fungi and insects,\r\nproductiveness, ease of multiplication, and capacity to bear grafts. For\r\nthe above qualities it offers exceptional opportunities to the\r\nplant-breeder. Its most prominent limitations are: Poor quality for\r\ntable use, inability to withstand dry soils or droughts and\r\nnon-adaptability to soils containing much lime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BACCHUS]\r\n\r\nThere is no question about the origin of Bacchus. It is a seedling of\r\nClinton which, as mentioned above, it greatly resembles in every\r\ncharacter. The variety was originated by J. H. Ricketts of Newburgh, New\r\nYork, and was first exhibited by him before the American Pomological\r\nSociety in 1879. It is well known in eastern United States and, as in\r\nNew York, is highly thought of as a wine grape.\r\n\r\n     Vine very vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes average in\r\n     length, numerous, of medium size, rather light to dark brown with\r\n     some bloom at nodes which are somewhat enlarged and flattened;\r\n     internodes intermediate in length; diaphragm below average\r\n     thickness; pith large to medium; shoots nearly glabrous; tendrils\r\n     continuous, of mean length, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds open early, of average size, rather short, thick, obtuse\r\n     to conical. Young leaves faintly tinged with carmine on lower side\r\n     only, prevailing color pale green with faint carmine tinge. Leaves\r\n     medium to small, thin; upper surface dark green, glossy, smooth;\r\n     lower surface dull green, not pubescent; veins indistinct; lobes\r\n     three in number, terminal lobe acuminate; petiolar sinus medium to\r\n     shallow, narrow sometimes nearly overlapping; basal sinus lacking;\r\n     lateral sinus shallow, wide; teeth of average depth and width.\r\n     Flowers open early, sterile; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens late and keeps well, hanging a long time on the vine.\r\n     Clusters small to medium, below average length, rather slender,\r\n     uniform, cylindrical, often single-shouldered, compact; peduncle\r\n     almost short, intermediate in size; pedicel short to medium,\r\n     slender, covered with a few small warts; brush short, wine-colored.\r\n     Berries variable in size, below medium to small, roundish, black,\r\n     glossy, covered with a moderate amount of blue bloom, hang well to\r\n     pedicels, firm. Skin thin, of average toughness, adheres only\r\n     slightly to the pulp, contains much wine-colored pigment, slightly\r\n     astringent. Flesh dark green, translucent, fine-grained, somewhat\r\n     tough, vinous, sweet at skin to tart near seeds, with slight\r\n     Riparia spiciness, of medium quality, improving as the season\r\n     advances. Seeds cling to pulp, one to four, average two, often many\r\n     abortive, above medium size, rather short and wide, usually plump,\r\n     sharply pointed, brownish; raphe obscure; chalaza above center,\r\n     pear-shaped, distinct. Must registers 95°-110°.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAILEY.\r\n\r\n(Lincecumii, Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Rural N. Y._, =50=:221, 222. 1891. _fig._ =2.= _Bush. Cat._,\r\n     =1894=:159. =3.= _N. Y.

Moreover the characters of\r\nVinifera and Labrusca have been transmitted to Bailey through Triumph,\r\nin which variety they are as well combined as in any other hybrid of the\r\ntwo species. The Lincecumii parent, Big Berry, is at the head of\r\nMunson's \"Big Berry Family\" of hybrids; brought in from the wild, it is\r\none of the best representatives of its species. Bailey, therefore, has\r\nroyal blood and if parentage counts in grapes, it should prove valuable.\r\nUnfortunately New York, at least the Station vineyard, is a little too\r\nfar north for the fruit to mature well. In cold winters the vine is\r\nliable to winter injury. In seasons when the grapes have matured the\r\nappearance and quality of the fruit have been such as to recommend it.\r\nIts vigor of vine and productiveness give it additional value, and if\r\nnot to be recommended for commercial plantings in this State, it can\r\nsurely be named as valuable for breeding purposes. The name of the\r\nvariety was bestowed upon it by its originator in honor of L. H. Bailey,\r\nknown by all grape-growers for his services to viticulture.\r\n\r\nBailey was originated by Munson from seeds of a wild Post-oak grape\r\ncalled Big Berry, fertilized with pollen of Triumph. The seed was\r\nplanted in 1887 and the original vine came into fruiting in 1889-90. The\r\nvariety is now very generally disseminated throughout the East, and the\r\nreports of its behavior, in the North at least, generally accord with\r\nthat from this Station given above.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, injured in severe winters, produces good crops of\r\n     fruit. Canes dark reddish-brown, of good length, of medium size and\r\n     number. Leaves average in size, light green, dull to slightly\r\n     glossy, with very distinct veins on lower surface which is\r\n     cobwebby. Flowers open late, fertile; upright stamens.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens unevenly almost as late as Catawba, keeps well.\r\n     Clusters rather large and long, not very broad, often blunt at\r\n     ends, cylindrical to irregularly tapering, usually not shouldered\r\n     but sometimes with a small, short shoulder, compact. Berries\r\n     persistent, medium to large, vary in shape from roundish to ovate\r\n     on account of compactness of clusters, change in color from\r\n     purplish-black to black, covered with a heavy blue bloom. Skin\r\n     medium to thin, strongly astringent, tough, adheres somewhat to the\r\n     pulp, contains a large amount of purplish-red pigment. Flesh\r\n     moderately juicy and tender, coarse, vinous, good in quality,\r\n     releases the seeds rather easily. Seeds numerous, medium to above\r\n     in size, moderately broad, above medium to medium length, blunt,\r\n     brownish; raphe buried in a shallow, narrow groove; chalaza large,\r\n     above center, circular to oval, distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nBANNER.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera, Bourquiniana?)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _U.

The Station\r\nwas not able to secure vines until 1906 and these have not yet fruited.\r\nSo far as is known it is not grown elsewhere in the State. Since the\r\nvariety has been well spoken of by horticulturists who have seen it, and\r\nsince it has been deemed worthy a place among the promising new fruits\r\nillustrated and described in the _Year Book of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture_ for 1906, the variety is discussed here. The\r\ntechnical description of it is quoted from the above reference.\r\n\r\nThe variety was originated by Joseph Bachman of Altus, Arkansas, from\r\nseed of Lindley pollinated by Delaware. The seed was planted in 1898.\r\nThe originator states that he suspects a Stark-Star vine growing\r\nalongside also furnished pollen as the Lindley blossoms were\r\nunprotected.\r\n\r\n     \"Cluster large, broad conical, heavily shouldered, very compact;\r\n     stem short; berries globular, of medium size, adhering tenaciously\r\n     to the small green peduncles; skin moderately thick, and rather\r\n     tough; amber red and glossy, but covered with a profuse bloom;\r\n     flesh translucent, juicy, and rather meaty; seeds few, very small,\r\n     brown; flavor refreshing subacid to sweet and aromatic; quality\r\n     good to very good.

Happily the variety is such that it should long honor the\r\nname it bears. The Barry is one of our best black grapes, resembling in\r\nberry and somewhat in flavor and keeping quality its European parent,\r\nBlack Hamburg. The flavor is delicate and sweet, the flesh tender, with\r\nthin skin and unobjectionable seeds. The appearance of berry and bunch\r\nis attractive. The fruit keeps splendidly, and as this is written, on\r\nthe twenty-ninth of February, leap-year, there are before the writer\r\nbunches of the Barry, kept in common storage without wrapping or other\r\nspecial care, which are in perfect condition. The vine is vigorous,\r\nhardy, and productive, but susceptible to mildew. The ripening season is\r\nusually said to be that of the Concord but, while it may color with the\r\nConcord it requires a longer time to ripen thoroughly and it is not at\r\nits best, or even good, unless properly matured. For the table, for\r\nwinter keeping, and for an amateur grape in general the Barry may be\r\nhighly recommended.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the origin of Barry see page 390 under \"Rogers'\r\nHybrids.\" It is first mentioned separately from the rest of Rogers'\r\nhybrids in 1864, though not named until 1869. Barry was placed on the\r\nlist of the American Pomological Society in 1869 where it is still\r\nretained. It is known and grown in the garden throughout the grape\r\nregions of eastern America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARRY]\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, usually hardy, productive, somewhat susceptible to\r\n     mildew. Canes long to very long, numerous, usually thick, dark\r\n     brown to slightly reddish-brown covered with a small amount of blue\r\n     bloom; nodes not enlarged, very slightly flattened; internodes\r\n     intermediate in length; diaphragm of average thickness; pith medium\r\n     to above in size; shoots nearly glabrous; tendrils intermittent,\r\n     fair length, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds open early, of average size, short, of medium thickness,\r\n     obtuse to conical.

It was received at this Station in 1892 and has borne fruit\r\nmany times since so that there has been abundant opportunity to see\r\ngrapes and vine. The variety is not especially well adapted to New York\r\nas the fruit is dull in color, lacking in quality, and shells somewhat\r\nbadly. The vine is very vigorous, bearing a handsome, compact mass of\r\nfoliage which retains its color and freshness throughout drouths and the\r\nheat of summer. In New York it must compete with Concord in commercial\r\nvineyards and since it does not equal that variety, taking its character\r\nas a whole, it cannot be recommended as a market grape. Its quality and\r\nappearance are such that it will never be largely grown by the amateur\r\nin the North. The variety, however, is of much interest and of possible\r\nvalue to the grape-breeder.\r\n\r\nMunson produced Beacon in 1887 from seed of Big Berry (a variety of\r\nLincecumii) pollinated by Concord, securing the first fruit in 1889. The\r\nvariety has been generally disseminated among grape specialists and\r\nexperiment stations and is now well known by grape-growers in general.\r\n\r\n     Vine a medium to very strong grower, not always hardy, productive.\r\n     Canes short, medium to rather slender, light brown. Leaves healthy,\r\n     variable in size, rather thick, inclined to dark green, sometimes\r\n     rugose, with veins showing indistinctly through the slight\r\n     pubescence of the lower surface. Flowers open in mid-season, on\r\n     plan of five or six, nearly fertile.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens with Concord or later and keeps fairly well. Clusters\r\n     are attractive in general appearance, of good size, rather long,\r\n     medium to slightly slender, cylindrical to somewhat tapering,\r\n     usually single-shouldered, compact to medium. Berries medium but\r\n     variable in size, roundish, purplish-black to black, dull in\r\n     appearance, covered with heavy blue bloom, inclined to shell in\r\n     some localities, moderately firm. Skin medium to thin, tough,\r\n     adheres strongly to pulp, contains a large amount of purplish-red\r\n     pigment, astringent. Flesh moderately tender, slightly aromatic,\r\n     spicy, vinous, mildly subacid to agreeably tart, often with a\r\n     noticeable Concord flavor, about as good as Concord in quality.\r\n     Seeds separate easily from the pulp, large to above medium, of\r\n     average length, broad, blunt to medium, slightly notched; raphe\r\n     obscure; chalaza above center, irregularly circular to slightly\r\n     oval.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAUTY.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera, Bourquiniana?)\r\n\r\n     =1.= Downing, =1881=:165 app. =2.= _Ill.

It had the honor, according\r\nto the _Bushberg Catalogue_,[161] of receiving at the Exposition at\r\nBordeaux, France, in 1880, the praise of having produced \"the best\r\nAmerican white wine on exhibition.\" According to the above authority\r\nRommel stopped its propagation and dissemination because of its\r\nsusceptibility to fungi. The variety is now practically lost to\r\ncultivation and was never largely grown in New York.\r\n\r\nBeauty is a cross between Delaware and Maxatawney originated by Jacob\r\nRommel of Morrison, Missouri, over thirty years ago. Bush questions the\r\nparentage as given by Rommel and thinks it more likely Catawba and\r\nMaxatawney. Rommel's Beauty should not be confused with the Beauty of\r\nMinnesota, a grape from the State for which it was named, which has been\r\ndiscarded because of poor quality.\r\n\r\n     Vine fairly vigorous, usually healthy and hardy, produces medium to\r\n     good crops. Canes long to medium, numerous, dark reddish-brown\r\n     often with a strong ashy-gray tinge, surface covered with slight\r\n     blue bloom.

WILLIE BELL (4, 9).\r\n\r\nBell is still another of Munson's hybrids, its parents being Elvira\r\ncrossed with Delaware. Its characters are chiefly those of Elvira and in\r\nparticular it has the Elvira flavor, which is somewhat against it for a\r\ntable grape. As to its value for wine-making there are no records though\r\nit may be assumed that it has the same value for this purpose as the\r\nElvira, which it so greatly resembles in flavor. From its behavior here,\r\nthis Station does not recommend Bell for New York.\r\n\r\nMunson produced Bell in 1881 from seed of Elvira pollinated by Delaware.\r\nAfter having tested it thoroughly the originator disseminated it and\r\ncontinues to offer it in his catalog; proof of its value for some of the\r\ngrape regions.\r\n\r\n     Vine a strong grower, hardy, usually produces full crops although a\r\n     shy bearer in some localities. Leaves vigorous, healthy, medium to\r\n     very large. Flowers open before mid-season, nearly fertile; stamens\r\n     upright. Fruit ripens in mid-season or later, keeps well. Clusters\r\n     intermediate in size and length, frequently shouldered, compact to\r\n     medium.

Berckmans was disseminated nearly forty years ago and\r\nthough the fruit is seemingly better adapted for the market than\r\nDelaware, and the vine much more vigorous, as hardy and as productive as\r\nits better known parent, yet the variety is seldom grown other than as\r\nan amateur grape. The berry and bunch resemble Delaware in shape; the\r\nfruit is of the same color; bunch and berry are larger, but the vine is\r\nnot quite as productive; the flesh is firmer, making it a better shipper\r\nand it keeps better; the quality is not so good, the flesh lacking\r\ntenderness, sweetness and richness in comparison with Delaware. The vine\r\nof Berckmans is much more vigorous and is less subject to mildew than\r\nthat of Delaware, but there are many reports that it suffers from\r\nleaf-hoppers and the rose bug, insects which seem inordinately fond of\r\nits foliage. The vine characters are not as good as those of Clinton.\r\nThe variety seems illy adapted to some soils and in particular does not\r\ncolor well if not suited in this respect. In spite of its many good\r\nqualities, popular verdict has decreed that Berckmans is but an\r\namateur's grape. The name commemorates the viticultural labors of P. J.\r\nBerckmans, a contemporary and friend of Dr. A. P. Wylie of Chester,\r\nSouth Carolina, who originated the variety and christened it Berckmans.\r\n\r\nBerckmans was produced by Dr. A. P. Wylie[162] of Chester, South\r\nCarolina, from Delaware seed fertilized by Clinton. The seed was\r\nplanted in 1868 and the plant bore its first fruit in 1870, the variety\r\nbeing introduced some years later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BERCKMANS]\r\n\r\n     Vine similar to Clinton in growth and foliage, vigorous to very\r\n     vigorous, hardy, produces average to good crops. Canes long,\r\n     numerous, rather slender, light to dark brown; nodes prominent,\r\n     flattened; internodes short; diaphragm below medium thickness; pith\r\n     medium to above in size; shoots not pubescent; tendrils\r\n     intermittent, long, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds intermediate in size, short, of average thickness,\r\n     conical to nearly obtuse, open very early. Young leaves decidedly\r\n     pale green with faintest trace of carmine, prevailing color green\r\n     on both sides. Leaves medium to small, thin; upper surface light\r\n     green, smooth; lower surface pale green, not pubescent; veins\r\n     inconspicuous; lobes vary from none to three, terminal lobe acute;\r\n     petiolar sinus medium to shallow, wide; basal sinus usually\r\n     lacking; lateral sinus shallow; teeth intermediate in depth and\r\n     width. Flowers open rather early, fertile; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens with Delaware and keeps unusually well. Clusters\r\n     attractive, much like Delaware in shape and size but slightly\r\n     longer and more often shouldered, compact to medium, averaging\r\n     slightly looser than either parent; peduncle rather short, slender;\r\n     pedicel longish, slender, covered with but few warts; brush short,\r\n     light green. Berries intermediate in size, slightly larger than\r\n     Delaware, roundish to slightly oval, resemble Delaware in color but\r\n     somewhat darker when well ripened, covered with lilac bloom,\r\n     persistent, of average firmness. Skin thin, somewhat tough,\r\n     slightly adhering to pulp, contains no pigment, nearly astringent.\r\n     Flesh pale yellowish-green, translucent, fine-grained, tender,\r\n     inclined to melting, vinous, sweet to agreeably tart, sprightly,\r\n     very good in quality. Seeds separate easily from the pulp, one to\r\n     four, average three, slightly below medium in size, rather broad\r\n     and blunt, brownish; raphe obscure; chalaza of average size,\r\n     slightly above center, irregularly oval, distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nBERTRAND.\r\n\r\n(Bourquiniana.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Am.

The\r\nvariety is hardy only as far north as Maryland and even in that State\r\nmust be planted in sheltered situations.\r\n\r\nJudge J. B. Jones, Herndon, Burke County, Georgia, found Bertrand as an\r\naccidental seedling, which had germinated in the spring of 1878. Judge\r\nJones gives the species as being Cordifolia but Berckmans says it looks\r\nlike an Aestivalis; it is now generally classed in the Bourquiniana\r\ngroup. The following description of this variety is compiled from\r\nvarious sources:\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous. Cluster above medium to rather large, usually\r\n     conical, most often shouldered, moderately compact; peduncle long.\r\n     Berries below medium in size, round, black with blue bloom; flesh\r\n     melting, juicy, very high flavored. Skin thin, tough. Ripens late.\r\n     Seeds few. Very productive in the South. Of value only for wine.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK DEFIANCE.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mass. Hort. Soc.

It ripens too late to be of much value in New York.\r\nWhen phylloxera had driven French grape-growers to look to America for\r\nvarieties of grapes, and before grafting on resistant stocks was\r\npracticed in that country, Black Defiance was looked upon with much\r\nfavor in France where it succeeded very well. The fruit is distinguished\r\nby the size, lustrous blackness and handsome bloom of the berry. It is\r\nnow rarely cultivated in New York having been replaced by varieties more\r\ncertain to mature in this State.\r\n\r\nStephen Underhill of Croton-on-Hudson, New York, produced Black Defiance\r\nfrom seed of Concord fertilized by Black Prince. It first fruited in\r\n1866. The variety was introduced without the originator's consent.\r\n\r\nBlack Defiance is described as follows:[163]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK EAGLE]\r\n\r\n     \"Growth medium, shoots smooth; leaves large, more or less\r\n     three-lobed, with uneven margin; bunches large, oblong with large\r\n     base, frequently branched; berries black, decidedly acid, pulp\r\n     rather firm, ripe July 22nd; defoliated on October 6, 1896.

On our grounds its season is about with Concord. The quality\r\nof Black Eagle is of the best, but the vine lacks in vigor, hardiness\r\nand productiveness and the fruit is susceptible to black-rot. As the\r\ncolor-plate shows, bunch and berry are large and attractive; bunches\r\nweighing nearly two pounds have been grown for exhibition purposes and\r\nprobably there are few if any showier hybrid grapes than this when at\r\nits best. The leaf is that of _Vitis vinifera_, deeply lobed, of a\r\nbeautiful green, and with firm texture, making with thrifty vines one of\r\nthe most attractive grape plants to be found in our vineyards. The\r\nvariety is self-sterile. Black Eagle has wholly failed as a commercial\r\nvariety and its several weaknesses will prevent amateurs from growing it\r\nlargely, yet it is far too good a grape to give up altogether and lovers\r\nof grapes should keep it in cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe variety originated with Stephen W. Underhill, Croton-on-Hudson, New\r\nYork, from seed of Concord pollinated by Black Prince. It first fruited\r\nin 1866. The variety was sent out by Underhill for testing and was\r\nintroduced without the originator's consent.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, not always hardy, not productive. Canes\r\n     rather rough, medium to long, of average number, thick, approaching\r\n     dark reddish-brown, covered with slight blue bloom; nodes strongly\r\n     enlarged, slightly flattened; internodes above medium length;\r\n     diaphragm thick; pith of average size; shoots pubescent; tendrils\r\n     continuous, long, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds intermediate in size, short, rather thick, pointed to\r\n     conical, open very late. Young leaves tinged with carmine on the\r\n     under surface and along margin of upper surface making the\r\n     prevailing color a light rose-carmine. Leaves of average size,\r\n     medium to thick; upper surface dark green, slightly glossy, smooth\r\n     to rugose; lower surface pale grayish-green, somewhat pubescent;\r\n     veins not distinct; lobes five in number, terminal lobe acute;\r\n     petiolar sinus deep to narrow, often closed and overlapping; basal\r\n     sinus very wide and deep; lateral sinus wide at bottom narrowing\r\n     towards top, deep; teeth intermediate in depth and width. Flowers\r\n     open in mid-season or later, fully self-sterile; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens in mid-season, keeps well if picked before overripe.\r\n     Clusters of large to average size, rather long, tapering, varying\r\n     from single-to double-shouldered, loose to compact; peduncle\r\n     longish, rather thick; pedicel long to medium, somewhat slender,\r\n     covered with very few warts, enlarged at point of attachment to\r\n     fruit; brush short, pale green. Berries variable in size averaging\r\n     large, slightly oval, black, glossy, covered with a moderate amount\r\n     of blue bloom, do not shatter, somewhat soft. Skin thin, rather\r\n     tender, adheres strongly to pulp, with slight amount of\r\n     wine-colored pigment, not astringent. Flesh pale green,\r\n     translucent, somewhat tender, vinous, not foxy, sweet at skin to\r\n     agreeably tart at center, quality good. Seeds separate easily, one\r\n     to four, average two or three, rather large and broad, nearly long.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK HAMBURG.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= Speechly, =1791=:11,179. =2.= _London Hort.

Since it is a standard of excellence which\r\nAmerican breeders of table grapes have long sought to attain, we may\r\nname its points of superiority over the table grapes now grown in our\r\nvineyards. 1st. Bunch and berry are large, well formed, and uniform.\r\n2nd. The fruits have a higher sugar and solid content than most American\r\ngrapes and keep better, ship better, make better wine and will make\r\nraisins. 3d. The flavor, to most palates, is richer, more delicate, and\r\nlacks the acidity of some American grapes and the foxiness of others.\r\n4th. The pulp and skin of Black Hamburg are more tender than the\r\nvarieties of the species of this country and the seeds are readily\r\nseparated from the pulp. 5th. The berries do not shell from the stem\r\nreadily. 6th. The vines are more compact in habit, make a shorter and\r\nstouter annual growth, and hence require less pruning and training. 7th.\r\nThe fruit is borne in greater quantity, vine for vine or acre for acre.\r\nAdded to the above qualities which make it desirable as a parent when\r\ncrosses are made between the grapes of this country and _Vitis\r\nvinifera_, are comparative hardiness among its kind, a short seasonal\r\ncycle of vegetation giving early maturity to fruit, ability to stand\r\nmore hardships than most of its species, and especially ability to\r\nmature its fruit with as small amount of solar heat as any of its\r\nspecies. Its weaknesses when planted out of doors in eastern America are\r\nthose of its species, which wholly prevent its successful cultivation in\r\nthe vineyards of this region and make it of interest and value only in\r\nbreeding and as an ideal toward which to breed.\r\n\r\nThe origin of Black Hamburg is apparently unknown. It was sent from\r\nHamburg, Germany, to England sometime in the early part of the\r\neighteenth century and it was in the latter country that it was given\r\nthe several variations of the name Hamburg. In the north of Europe it is\r\nknown as Frankendale or Frankenthal. Black Hamburg is grown in Europe\r\nchiefly as a forcing grape. It is doubtful if all the synonyms refer to\r\none seed variety, but if not the same, they are so similar as to be\r\ndifficult if not impossible to distinguish from each other.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, tender, productive. Canes long, numerous, rather\r\n     thick to medium, light brown but darker at nodes, covered with\r\n     faint pubescence; nodes enlarged, slightly flattened; internodes\r\n     short to medium; diaphragm thick; pith large; shoots slightly\r\n     pubescent; tendrils intermittent, frequently several nodes with no\r\n     tendrils, long, bifid to trifid, dehisce early.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds large to medium, rather long, somewhat thick, conical to\r\n     obtuse. Leaves good size, thin; upper surface light green, rather\r\n     dull, of average smoothness; lower surface slightly lighter than\r\n     upper surface, with small amount of pubescence, hairy; veins\r\n     moderately distinct; lobes vary from none to five, terminal lobe\r\n     nearly acute; petiolar sinus often strongly urn-shaped, of average\r\n     depth, nearly narrow, sometimes closed and overlapping; basal sinus\r\n     shallow to narrow; lateral sinus rather deep to narrow, often\r\n     notched; teeth very irregular in depth and width.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens early in October, keeps well. Clusters large, long to\r\n     medium, rather broad, cylindrical to tapering, inclined to\r\n     irregular, usually single-shouldered, nearly compact; peduncle\r\n     medium to short, somewhat thick; pedicel long, slender, covered\r\n     with small, numerous, prominent warts; brush short, thick, tinged\r\n     with red. Berries rather large, oval to nearly roundish, dark\r\n     purple to nearly black, slightly glossy, covered with faint blue or\r\n     lilac bloom, do not drop from pedicel, moderate in firmness. Skin\r\n     thin, tender, adheres to the pulp, contains no pigment, not\r\n     astringent. Flesh pale green, tender, fine-grained, vinous,\r\n     sprightly, rather sweet and refreshing, very good to best. Seeds\r\n     separate easily, one to four averaging two or three, above medium\r\n     size, long, rather narrow, sharply pointed, brownish; raphe\r\n     obscure; chalaza intermediate in size, decidedly above center,\r\n     distinct, circular to oval.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK HAWK.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _U.

It is chiefly remarkable because of its\r\nvery dark green foliage which at a little distance seems almost black.\r\nIt is rarely or almost never cultivated in New York.\r\n\r\nSamuel Miller of Calmdale, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, in the fifties\r\nproduced Black Hawk from Concord seed sent to him by E. W. Bull. The\r\nstock was bought and the variety introduced by a Mr. Knox of Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nThe following description was compiled from various sources:\r\n\r\n     Vine hardy, resembles Concord except for foliage being much darker.\r\n     Bunch medium to sometimes large; berry medium to above, nearly\r\n     round, black, of tender flesh but hardly good in quality; sometimes\r\n     shatters. Ripens with Concord or slightly before. Self-sterile.\r\n     Rather late in blooming.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK IMPERIAL.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Bourquiniana, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mo. Hort. Soc.

It has high quality\r\nand is handsome in appearance but is so susceptible to fungi as to be\r\nalmost worthless and has now passed from cultivation.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Stayman of Leavenworth, Kansas, produced Black Imperial from seed\r\nof Dutchess some time in the eighties. The variety was first called\r\nBlack's Imperial. There was another variety preceding this which is\r\nmentioned by Prince[164] and Fuller[165] in the sixties by the name of\r\nBlack Imperial.\r\n\r\nThe following description is taken largely from that of the originator:\r\n\r\n     Vine usually moderately vigorous and productive. Cluster large,\r\n     shouldered, compact. Berries of medium size, black, tender, juicy;\r\n     flavor sweet, vinous; quality good to very good. Flowers\r\n     self-fertile.

Unfortunately the vine is not in the Station vineyard and our\r\nestimate of its vine characters is taken from the descriptions of\r\nothers. According to the _Bushberg Catalogue_,[166] \"The vine is a\r\nvigorous healthy grower similar in appearance of growth and foliage to\r\nElvira and Noah.\" The bunches and berries, as they have been sent to\r\nthis Station, are larger than Clinton and of better quality though of\r\nsmall value as a table fruit. It seems well agreed among wine-makers\r\nthat Black Pearl makes an exceptionally good red wine equalling or\r\nsurpassing any other of our northern varieties for this purpose. Without\r\ndoubt, from the many testimonials as to its value for wine-making, it\r\ncan be highly recommended for this purpose and as a good starting point\r\nfrom which to breed wine grapes. So far, though grown for more than\r\nthirty years, its culture is confined to the islands in Lake Erie\r\ndevoted to grape-growing and the variety can hardly be said to be known\r\nin New York. It is probably too late for most parts of New York as it\r\nripens with Catawba.\r\n\r\nBlack Pearl was originated by Casper Schraidt of Put-in-bay, Ohio, over\r\nthirty years ago. The originator states that it is a seedling of\r\nDelaware but this has generally been discredited, as the vine is\r\nevidently of the Riparia type. Bush says it is probably a seedling of\r\nClinton or Taylor.\r\n\r\n     Vine a strong grower, does not winter-kill, usually a good yielder,\r\n     susceptible to attacks of mildew. Canes are long, numerous, and of\r\n     average thickness. Leaves are intermediate in size. Flowers open in\r\n     mid-season or before, sterile or nearly so; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens with Catawba, keeps fairly well. Clusters small to\r\n     medium, larger than Clinton, medium to rather slender, tapering to\r\n     cylindrical, often single-shouldered, intermediate to compact.\r\n     Berries below medium to very small, roundish, oblate or frequently\r\n     compressed on account of compactness of cluster, black, glossy,\r\n     covered with a moderate amount of blue bloom, persistent, firm.\r\n     Skin thin, tender, adheres strongly to the pulp, contains an\r\n     unusually large amount of purplish-red pigment, astringent. Flesh\r\n     moderately juicy, usually with a decided red tinge, nearly tender,\r\n     slightly spicy, tart, medium to below in flavor and quality. Seeds,\r\n     which adhere but little to the pulp, are medium to below in size,\r\n     short to medium, broad, slightly notched, blunt, dark brown; raphe\r\n     obscure; chalaza central, oval to circular, distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRANT.\r\n\r\n(Riparia, Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= Downing, =1869=:532. =2.= _Am.

Neither has ever become popular in\r\nNorth America because of their susceptibility to fungi. As Riparia and\r\nVinifera hybrids, the best of Arnold's seedlings from crosses of these\r\ntwo species, they are of interest and of possible value in\r\ngrape-breeding. Since Brant and Canada are so nearly alike a discussion\r\nof one will suffice for both and this is reserved for Canada, the better\r\nknown and more valuable of the two varieties.\r\n\r\nCharles Arnold of Paris, Canada, produced this variety sometime in the\r\nsixties. It is a seedling of Clinton pollinated by Black St. Peters. The\r\nfollowing description of it is taken from Downing's _Fruits and\r\nFruit-Trees of America_:[167]\r\n\r\n     \"Vine strong, healthy grower.

It has the distinction, too, of\r\nbeing one of the first, if not the first, secondary or attenuated hybrid\r\nof Labrusca with Vinifera, _i. e._, the offspring of a hybrid crossed\r\nwith one of the original parents or with a variety of the same species.\r\nThe parents of Brighton were Diana Hamburg, a hybrid of Vinifera crossed\r\nwith Labrusca, and Concord, a pure-bred Labrusca. As we have seen, the\r\nfirst or primary hybrids of Vinifera with Labrusca have given grapes of\r\nhigh quality, but lacking in vigor, in resistance to fungi and\r\nphylloxera, and for most part infertile in bloom. The secondary hybrids\r\nhave not shown the weaknesses of the primary hybrids in nearly so marked\r\na degree but have given, in many instances, as in Brighton, Diamond and\r\nprobably Delaware, varieties of nearly as high quality. It is now\r\ngenerally recognized by viticulturists that the secondary hybrids with\r\nVinifera promise much more than do the primary ones and it is no mean\r\ndistinction that Brighton has of being the first secondary hybrid\r\nbrought about by the hand of man.\r\n\r\nBrighton ranks as one of the leading amateur grapes in New York and is\r\namong the ten or twelve chief commercial sorts of the State. Its good\r\npoints are: High quality, handsome appearance, certainty of ripening,\r\nbeing earlier than Concord, vigorous growth, productiveness,\r\nadaptability to various soils, and, for a hybrid, ability to withstand\r\nfungi. It is thus seen that the infusion of foreign blood has given the\r\nfruit of Brighton some of the excellencies of _Vitis vinifera_ while the\r\npreponderance of _Vitis labrusca_ blood has preserved the vigor and\r\nhardiness of the native species. Brighton has two serious defects which\r\nno doubt have kept it from taking higher rank as a commercial variety:\r\nIt deteriorates in quality very quickly after maturity so that it cannot\r\nbe kept for more than a few days at its best, hence cannot be well\r\nshipped to distant markets; and it is self-sterile to a more marked\r\ndegree than any other of our commonly grown grapes. To have it at its\r\nbest the fruit should be thinned.\r\n\r\nThis grape is a signal example of a variety resulting from careful and\r\nskilful work in grape-breeding. Its originator, Jacob Moore,[168]\r\npossessed of a high degree of intelligence and an unusually keen sense\r\nof the latent possibilities in plants, with unwearied perseverance spent\r\nyears in the attempt to produce grapes combining the good characters of\r\nthe Old and the New World grapes. As a result of his zeal and patience\r\nwe have Brighton and Diamond, the most valuable grapes of their class.\r\nJacob Moore's demonstration of the value of the secondary hybrid, and\r\nthese two grapes, must serve to commemorate a life spent in self denial,\r\nimposed poverty and comparative obscurity that horticulture might be\r\nenriched.\r\n\r\nBrighton is a seedling of Diana Hamburg pollinated by Concord, raised by\r\nthe late Jacob Moore at Brighton, New York. The original vine fruited\r\nfor the first time in 1870 and fruit was first exhibited at the meeting\r\nof the New York Horticultural Society in 1872.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIGHTON]\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous and hardy, producing average to good crops, often\r\n     subject to mildew.

In cluster and size of berry, Brilliant resembles\r\nLindley; in color and quality of fruit it is about the same as\r\nDelaware, differing from it chiefly in having more astringency in the\r\nskin and therefore not quite equal to Delaware as a table grape. The\r\nvine is strong and hardy; season about with Delaware. Brilliant does not\r\ncrack or shell and therefore ships well, and has very good keeping\r\nqualities, especially on the vine, where it will often hang for weeks.\r\nThe defects which have kept it from becoming one of the standard\r\ncommercial sorts in New York are: Marked susceptibility to fungi but not\r\nmore susceptible than Delaware; variable in size of cluster; uneven in\r\nripening; and lack of productiveness. Brilliant is well known by amateur\r\ngrape-growers in New York and is grown somewhat for the market. All in\r\nall it is probably the best known and most widely grown of Munson's\r\nvarieties in this State. In favorable situations, this variety may\r\nalways be expected to please the amateur, and the commercial grower will\r\noften find it a profitable sort.\r\n\r\nThe seed which produced Brilliant was planted by Munson in 1883 and the\r\nvariety was introduced by him in 1887. It has been widely tested by\r\nexperimenters and grape-growers and is highly spoken of, whether in the\r\nEast, West, North or South.\r\n\r\n     Vine variable in growth averaging vigorous, usually hardy, not\r\n     always productive. Canes long, numerous, thick, darkish-brown;\r\n     nodes enlarged, usually flattened; internodes long to medium;\r\n     diaphragm thick; pith large, shoots pubescent; tendrils\r\n     intermittent, long, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds somewhat large, short, thick, obtuse to conical, open\r\n     late. Young leaves heavily tinged on both sides with mahogany-red\r\n     changing to light carmine. Leaves medium to large, thick; upper\r\n     surface dark green, dull, rugose; lower surface grayish-green,\r\n     downy; veins well defined; entire or obscurely three-lobed with\r\n     terminal lobe blunt to acute; petiolar sinus deep, narrow,\r\n     V-shaped; basal and lateral sinuses obscure and shallow when\r\n     present; teeth intermediate in depth and width. Flowers open medium\r\n     late, fertile; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens unevenly, in season about with Delaware, keeps a long\r\n     time. Clusters average larger than Delaware, intermediate in length\r\n     and breadth, often blunt, cylindrical to somewhat conical, usually\r\n     slightly shouldered, medium to compact; peduncle rather thick;\r\n     pedicel medium to short, thick, covered with few small warts, wide\r\n     at point of attachment to berry; brush short, thick, pale green\r\n     with reddish-brown tinge. Berries average larger than Delaware,\r\n     roundish to very slightly oval, attractive dark red, not so\r\n     brilliant as Delaware but more so than Brighton, rather glossy,\r\n     covered with abundant lilac bloom, adhere strongly to pedicel,\r\n     firm. Skin rather thin and tough, adheres considerably to pulp,\r\n     contains no pigment, slightly astringent. Flesh pale green, rather\r\n     transparent, juicy, slightly stringy, inclined to tenderness when\r\n     fully ripe, fine-grained, vinous, sweetish at skin but tart next\r\n     the seeds, good but not equal to Delaware. Seeds cling somewhat to\r\n     pulp, one to four in number, average three, rather large and broad,\r\n     slightly elongated, plump, light brown; raphe obscure; chalaza\r\n     large, slightly above center, irregularly circular to slightly\r\n     oval, distinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRILLIANT]\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera?)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _N.

BROWN SEEDLING (5, 6, 8).\r\n\r\nWm. B. Brown of Newburgh gives the history of the grape bearing his name\r\nas follows:[169] \"Brown's seedling came up in my yard at Newburgh, New\r\nYork, about fifteen years ago [this statement was made in 1899] near an\r\nIsabella vine. There was not and never had been any other vine in the\r\nyard at that time.\" The statement is further made that Charles Downing\r\nexamined the vine several times and said \"there was no doubt but that it\r\nwas a seedling of the Isabella.\" Brown was exhibited at the New York\r\nState Fair in 1892 and was given a first prize. It was again exhibited\r\nat the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893 and was awarded a diploma\r\nand honorable mention. The originator states that the variety \"has been\r\nexhibited in at least twenty-five fairs and has always received first\r\nprize.\" Since 1892 Brown has been several times described with favorable\r\nmention in the horticultural press. This variety was distributed in 1907\r\nto the subscribers of the _Rural New Yorker_ as Brown's Early. In spite\r\nof the encomiums of fairs and newspapers during the past fifteen or\r\ntwenty years, Brown has not received favorable recognition from the\r\ngrape-growers of New York. As the variety grows on the Station grounds\r\nthe quality is only good, not high, and the berries shatter badly.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to medium, hardy, very productive. Canes medium to\r\n     short, intermediate in number, medium to slender, moderately dark\r\n     brown. Leaves of average size and thickness, healthy, rather light\r\n     green, slightly glossy; veins well defined, distinctly showing\r\n     through the thick bronze pubescence of the lower surface. Flowers\r\n     open medium early, nearly fertile; stamens upright. Tendrils\r\n     continuous; diaphragm below medium to thin.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Hartford or a little earlier, appears to\r\n     keep fairly well, inclined to shatter. Clusters variable in size,\r\n     averaging medium to small, of mean length, slender to medium,\r\n     cylindrical to slightly tapering, usually single-shouldered, loose\r\n     to medium in compactness. Berries intermediate in size, roundish to\r\n     slightly oval, black, covered with rather thick blue bloom,\r\n     inclined to shatter from cluster soon after ripening, of average\r\n     firmness. Skin intermediate in thickness and toughness, adheres\r\n     slightly to the pulp, contains a small amount of wine-colored\r\n     pigment, astringent. Flesh juicy, rather tough, fine-grained, foxy,\r\n     mild next the skin to slightly tart at center, good in quality but\r\n     not equal to the best varieties. Seeds intermediate in size, medium\r\n     to short, rather blunt, light brown; raphe buried in a shallow\r\n     groove; chalaza small, central to slightly above center, circular,\r\n     moderately distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPBELL EARLY.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Ohio Hort.

The fact that it came from a grape-breeder who had already\r\ngiven viticulture several valuable varieties, with the statement that\r\nthis was the result of years of experimenting and the greatest triumph\r\nof a life devoted to improving grapes, gave warrant for the enthusiasm\r\nwith which it was received. Nor did first impressions belie the oft-made\r\nstatement that Campbell Early represented a phenomenal advancement in\r\ngrape culture. Bunch, berry and vine seemed to indicate that this was\r\nthe best black American grape under cultivation. Nearly two decades have\r\npassed since Campbell Early was introduced, and though admitted by all\r\nto be a good grape, yet it has hardly met the expectations of the\r\ngrape-growers who from almost every state and territory welcomed the\r\nnewcomer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMPBELL EARLY]\r\n\r\nThe preeminently meritorious qualities of Campbell Early are: High\r\nquality when mature; freedom from foxiness and from acidity about the\r\nseeds; small seeds which easily part from the flesh; earliness of\r\nmaturity, ripening nearly a fortnight before Concord; large size and\r\nattractive appearance of bunch and berry (the color-plate does not do\r\nthe Campbell Early justice as to size of berry and bunch); comparative\r\nhardiness of the vine; and good shipping and keeping qualities. Campbell\r\nEarly falls short chiefly in not being adapted to as many soils and\r\nconditions as are some of the varieties with which it must compete and\r\nin all but localities well adapted to it the variety lacks\r\nproductiveness. In other words it is somewhat lacking in that elasticity\r\nof constitution so characteristic of Concord. Its reputation for quality\r\nhas suffered, and to the detriment of the variety, because it attains\r\nits full color before it is ripe and is therefore often marketed in an\r\nunripe condition. The fruit is quite variable in size as grown under\r\ndifferent conditions and somewhat so as grown in the same vineyard,\r\nranging in size of bunch from very large to small, differing somewhat in\r\nshape and with some compact and with some loose clusters. The color of\r\nthe berry is not as attractive as that of Concord as it has less of the\r\nwaxy bloom which makes the last named sort so handsome.\r\n\r\nBut the weaknesses attributed to Campbell Early do not wholly explain\r\nwhy so good a variety has seemingly failed to meet expectations. Can it\r\nbe that the fault is with the American grape-grower more than with the\r\ngrape? American growers are not yet willing to give varieties of grapes\r\nthe particular care that each may need for its best development, but\r\nseemingly prefer to grow those sorts which are cosmopolitan as to\r\nenvironment and which will thrive under a general treatment. It cannot\r\nbe that the consumers of this fruit care for less than a dozen of the\r\nseveral hundred American grapes; or that under the varied conditions of\r\nhalf a continent over which grow a score of species of wild grapes but a\r\nmeager half dozen varieties can be grown for commercial purposes. If our\r\ngrape-growers were willing to give the Campbell Early, and a score of\r\nother sorts of superior merit, the special care that European\r\nvineyardists give the hundreds of varieties they successfully grow, our\r\nviticulture would not long remain confined to the culture of a few\r\ngrapes of mediocre quality.\r\n\r\nThe name commemorates the services to viticulture of the originator of\r\nthe variety, Geo. W. Campbell[170] of Delaware, Ohio, who devoted a long\r\nand active life to the improvement of the grape. The variety is a\r\nseedling of Moore Early pollinated by another production of Campbell's,\r\nwhich was a seedling of Belvidere pollinated by Muscat Hamburg. Campbell\r\nEarly bore for the first time in 1892, and was soon after introduced by\r\nGeorge S. Josselyn of Fredonia, New York. It is now known and grown\r\nthroughout the grape regions of eastern America.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to medium, hardy, productive to very productive.\r\n     Canes of average length and number, somewhat thick, dark\r\n     reddish-brown, surface often roughened with small warts; nodes\r\n     intermediate in size, flattened; internodes medium to short;\r\n     diaphragm of mean thickness; pith of average size; shoots\r\n     pubescent; tendrils intermittent, rather short, trifid to bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds intermediate in size, inclined to long, slender to\r\n     medium, pointed to conical, open early. Young leaves heavily tinged\r\n     on lower surface and along margin of upper surface with bright\r\n     carmine. Leaves medium to large, thick to medium; upper surface\r\n     green, slightly glossy, intermediate in smoothness; lower surface\r\n     bronze to pale green, heavily pubescent; veins distinct; lobes\r\n     often three in number but usually entire, terminal lobe acute;\r\n     petiolar sinus rather shallow, medium to wide; basal sinus usually\r\n     pubescent; lateral sinus varying from medium wide to a mere notch,\r\n     frequently dentate; teeth shallow to medium, narrow. Flowers\r\n     fertile, open in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit variable in season, extending through a long period, becomes\r\n     marketable somewhat earlier than Worden, keeps and ships unusually\r\n     well. Clusters variable in size ranging from very large to medium,\r\n     rather long and broad, tapering to cylindrical, frequently\r\n     single-shouldered, usually two bunches per shoot, compact to\r\n     slightly loose; peduncle short to medium, thick; pedicel below\r\n     average in length and thickness, covered with small numerous warts;\r\n     brush long, light wine color. Berries somewhat variable in size,\r\n     usually large, roundish to slightly oval, dark purplish-black,\r\n     rather dull as the season advances, covered with heavy blue bloom,\r\n     persistent, moderately firm. Skin medium to thin, tough, does not\r\n     crack, adheres slightly to the pulp, contains a small amount of\r\n     dark red pigment, somewhat astringent. Flesh greenish, translucent,\r\n     juicy, varying from rather tough to nearly soft, slightly coarse,\r\n     not foxy, somewhat vinous, nearly sweet from skin to center,\r\n     quality good and improves by hanging on the vines, superior to\r\n     Concord. Seeds separate readily from the flesh, one to four,\r\n     average three, of medium size and length, rather broad, light\r\n     brown, often with yellowish tips; raphe obscure; chalaza\r\n     intermediate in size, slightly above center, oval, obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANADA.\r\n\r\n(Riparia, Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Horticulturist_, =22=:363, 365. 1867. _fig._ =2.= _Rec. of\r\n     Hort._, =1868=:44. =3.= Downing, =1869=:533. =4.= _Bush.

In France when American varieties were being largely used in\r\nthe reconstruction of the vineyards destroyed by phylloxera, Canada was\r\none of the prime favorites, because of its short period for fruit\r\ndevelopment and maturity and the comparatively high quality of the wine\r\nwhich could be made from it. In America it has never gained great\r\npopularity on account of its susceptibility to fungal diseases. In this\r\nrespect as in some others, it shows Vinifera more than Riparia\r\nparentage; thus in shape, color and texture of foliage, in the flavor of\r\nthe fruit, and in the seeds there are decided indications of Vinifera\r\nwhile the vine, especially in the slenderness of the shoots, and the\r\nbunch and berry, shows Riparia. If, as is surmised, there is some\r\nLabrusca in Clinton, the Riparia parent of Canada, there are no\r\ndiscernible traces of the first named species in this variety. Canada\r\nand Brant, its full brother, are often confused with each other but\r\nthere are numerous minor differences in buds, foliage, canes, in the\r\nshape of the bunch, in the seeds and in the time of ripening which a\r\nreading of the descriptions of the two varieties will reveal. Canada has\r\nlittle value as a dessert fruit but makes a very good red wine, having,\r\naccording to the French, a most agreeable bouquet, but in America it is\r\nsurpassed by other wine grapes in so many characters that it can\r\nprobably never attain a place in this country for other than breeding\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe grape to which Arnold[171] gave the name Canada is a seedling of\r\nClinton, a Labrusca-Riparia hybrid, fertilized by Black St. Peters, a\r\nvariety of _Vitis vinifera_. Arnold planted the seed which produced\r\nCanada and its brother Brant about 1860. During the decade that followed\r\nthe variety was sent out as _Arnold No. 16_, but as it became more\r\nwidely distributed the name was changed to Canada.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to very vigorous, hardy, not always healthy, usually\r\n     productive. Canes long, numerous, variable in size but averaging\r\n     slender, nearly ash-gray at internodes to reddish-brown at nodes,\r\n     covered with a slight blue bloom; nodes enlarged, not flattened;\r\n     internodes above medium to short; diaphragm of average thickness,\r\n     rather large; shoots strongly pubescent; tendrils intermittent,\r\n     nearly short, trifid to bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds intermediate in size, short, of average thickness,\r\n     conical to obtuse, open rather late. Young leaves pale green with\r\n     faintest trace of carmine, prevailing color green on upper and\r\n     lower sides. Leaves intermediate in size, medium to thin; upper\r\n     surface light green, nearly smooth; lower surface pale green,\r\n     hairy; veins obscure; lobes five in number, often obscure, terminal\r\n     lobe acute to acuminate; petiolar sinus deep, medium to narrow;\r\n     basal sinus variable in depth and width; lateral sinus usually deep\r\n     and narrow when well defined; teeth deep, wide. Flowers\r\n     occasionally on plan of six, somewhat fertile to partly sterile,\r\n     open moderately early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens in mid-season or later, keeps fairly well. Clusters\r\n     intermediate in size, long to medium, rather slender, uniform,\r\n     often strongly cylindrical, sometimes single-shouldered, very\r\n     compact; peduncle short, slender; pedicel long, slender, nearly\r\n     smooth; brush short, light brown. Berries not uniform, average\r\n     medium to small, roundish when not compressed by compactness of\r\n     cluster, attractive purplish-black to black, glossy, covered with\r\n     heavy dark blue bloom, persistent, firm. Skin thin, does not crack,\r\n     rather tough, adheres but slightly to the pulp, contains a slight\r\n     amount of pigment, not astringent. Flesh rather dark green, very\r\n     juicy, fine-grained, somewhat tender when fully ripe, spicy,\r\n     pleasant vinous flavor, nearly sweet to agreeably tart, ranking\r\n     medium to above in quality. Seeds separate readily from pulp, one\r\n     to three, average two, intermediate in size and breadth, of average\r\n     length, blunt, light brown; raphe completely obscure; chalaza\r\n     intermediate in size, slightly above center, oval, distinct,\r\n     somewhat obscure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANADA]\r\n\r\n\r\nCANANDAIGUA.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\nCanandaigua has not been generally distributed and would not be\r\nmentioned here were it not for its exceptional keeping qualities. To\r\ntest the keeping qualities of grapes in common storage, 265 varieties\r\nwere put in the fruit house at this Station in the fall of 1907. The\r\ntest ended April 16, 1908, when it was found that Canandaigua was in the\r\nbest condition of all varieties. Its quality is very good at picking\r\ntime but seems, if anything, to improve in storage, and it was as good\r\nat the end of the test as at the beginning. Its vine characters are\r\nthose of Labrusca-Vinifera hybrids and such, as the variety grows on the\r\nStation grounds, as make it the equal of the average cultivated hybrid\r\nof these two species. The characters of the fruit, too, show plainly an\r\nadmixture of Vinifera and Labrusca so combined as to make the grapes\r\nvery similar to the best of such hybrids. The variety is quite worthy of\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nCanandaigua is a chance seedling found by E. L. Van Wormer of\r\nCanandaigua, New York, growing among wild grapes. Its high quality and\r\nhandsome appearance attracted his attention and the vine was put under\r\ncultivation, after which its long-keeping qualities were discovered.\r\nVines were sent to this Station for testing in 1897. All of its\r\ncharacters indicate that it is a hybrid between Labrusca and Vinifera.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, doubtfully hardy, medium to productive. Tendrils\r\n     semi-continuous to semi-intermittent, bifid, dehisce early. Leaves\r\n     large to medium, thin. Flowers sterile or sometimes partly fertile,\r\n     open in mid-season; stamens reflexed. Fruit ripens after\r\n     mid-season, keeps unusually well. Clusters variable in size,\r\n     usually heavily single-shouldered, loose to medium. Berries large\r\n     to medium, slightly oval to roundish, black, covered with a fair\r\n     amount of blue bloom, persistent. Flesh firm, sweet and rich, good\r\n     in quality, improving as the season advances. Seeds often long,\r\n     with enlarged neck; raphe shows as a partially obscured cord in a\r\n     medium deep groove; chalaza above center, distinctly pear-shaped.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\n\r\n(Lincecumii, Rupestris, Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Rural N.

The clusters are large\r\nand long but very loose and unattractive in appearance, and the fruit\r\nranks low in quality. We are forced to conclude, judging from the\r\nseveral seasons the variety has fruited on these grounds, that it is of\r\nlittle value in New York. The breeding of Captain is such that it could\r\nhardly be expected to thrive in this latitude.\r\n\r\nCaptain was produced by T. V. Munson from seed of America fertilized\r\nwith R. W. Munson.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, moderately productive. Canes long to medium,\r\n     numerous, covered with rather thick blue bloom; tendrils\r\n     intermittent, bifid and trifid. Leaves very large to medium, thick,\r\n     not pubescent but very hairy along ribs. Flowers semi-fertile, open\r\n     rather late; stamens upright. Fruit ripens later than Concord, does\r\n     not keep long although it ships well. Clusters large to above\r\n     medium, long, slender, sometimes double-shouldered, very loose.\r\n     Berries very large to below medium, inclined to roundish, black,\r\n     covered with heavy blue bloom, persistent. Skin contains a large\r\n     amount of purplish-red pigment. Flesh medium juicy, coarse, tender,\r\n     lacks character, tart from skin to center, fair in quality.

In the twenty-three years it\r\nhas been known in New York it has not become popular with grape-growers\r\nchiefly because it ripens too late for this region and when ripe does\r\nnot attain the high quality ascribed to it elsewhere. Its most valuable\r\ncharacter is that of long keeping, whether while hanging on the vine or\r\nafter harvesting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARMAN]\r\n\r\nT. V. Munson of Denison, Texas, raised Carman from seed of a wild\r\nPost-oak grape taken from the woods, pollinated with mixed pollen of\r\nTriumph and Herbemont. It was introduced in 1892 and placed on the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society fruit catalog list in 1897. The variety\r\nwas named in honor of E. S. Carman, for many years editor of the\r\n_Rural New Yorker_, and a plant-breeder of note.\r\n\r\n     Vine very vigorous to medium, hardy, lacking in productiveness.\r\n     Canes long, numerous, thick, brown to reddish-brown; nodes but\r\n     slightly enlarged, flattened; internodes long to medium; diaphragm\r\n     somewhat thick; pith above medium size; shoots very pubescent;\r\n     tendrils intermittent, long, trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds rather large, nearly short, thick, conical to obtuse,\r\n     open rather late. Young leaves slightly tinged with rose on upper\r\n     and lower sides. Leaves in good condition until injured by frost,\r\n     large, thick; upper surface light to dark green, somewhat glossy,\r\n     older leaves rugose; lower surface pale green, pubescent; veins\r\n     indistinct; terminal lobe acute to obtuse; petiolar sinus deep to\r\n     narrow; basal sinus often absent or shallow; lateral sinus medium\r\n     to shallow when present; teeth intermediate in depth and width.\r\n     Flowers on plan of five or six, fertile or nearly so, open very\r\n     late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens just before Catawba, an excellent keeper. Clusters\r\n     variable in size, of average length and breadth, tapering to\r\n     cylindrical, frequently single-shouldered, usually compact;\r\n     peduncle above medium length and thickness; pedicel short, slender,\r\n     smooth with very slight swelling at point of attachment to berry;\r\n     brush short, slender, wine-colored. Berries inferior in size,\r\n     roundish to slightly oblate, dark purplish-black to black, glossy,\r\n     covered with a fair amount of blue bloom, persistent, firm. Skin\r\n     rather thin, tough, nearly free from pulp, contains little or no\r\n     pigment, not astringent. Flesh yellowish-green, not juicy, somewhat\r\n     tender when fully ripe, has some Post-oak flavor, vinous, spicy,\r\n     sweetish at skin to tart next the seeds, good to very good. Seeds\r\n     separate easily from pulp, one to four, average two or three,\r\n     small, of mean length and breadth, blunt, brownish; raphe sometimes\r\n     cord-like; chalaza intermediate in size, slightly above center,\r\n     oval to pear-shaped, distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATAWBA.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= Adlum, =1823=:109, 139. =2.= Ib., =1828=:173. =3.= Ib.,\r\n     =1828=:176. =4.= Prince, =1830=:175. =5.= Ib., =1830=:180. =6.= _U.\r\n     S.

The elasticity of constitution which enables it to\r\nadapt itself to many environments and therefore to succeed in a vast\r\nregion; its possible existence for centuries in the wild state, for the\r\nrecords of a century have not divulged the secret of its origin, of its\r\nancestry, or of its introduction; its high quality and attractive\r\nappearance which give it intrinsic value as a table grape and for making\r\nwine; the fact that it was our first great American grape and that after\r\na century it is still one of the four leading varieties of grapes\r\ncultivated in eastern America and that after this lapse of time it is\r\nthe chief of all northern varieties for wine-making; all these make\r\nCatawba of prime interest to the grower of American grapes. The Catawba,\r\ntoo, has had the rare distinction of having a poet, Longfellow, sing its\r\npraises:\r\n\r\n    \"Very good in its way is the Verzenay\r\n       Or the Sillery, soft and creamy,\r\n     But Catawba wine has a taste more divine,\r\n       More dulcet, delicious and dreamy.\r\n     There grows no vine, by the haunted Rhine,\r\n       By the Danube or Guadalquiver,\r\n     Nor island or cape, that bears such a grape\r\n       As grows by the beautiful River.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATAWBA]\r\n\r\nIn Chapter II, American Grapes, we have seen how important a part the\r\nCatawba played in the first grape regions of this country. It is still\r\nthe leading grape along the shores of Lake Erie in northern Ohio, and\r\nabout the Central Lakes of New York. In the latter region immense areas\r\nare devoted to this variety, the product going to the general market and\r\nto the wine-cellars where it is the chief sort used in the making of\r\nchampagne. Its characters are such that it is not too much to say that\r\ndid it but ripen two weeks earlier in the other grape regions of New\r\nYork, the Chautauqua, Hudson and Ontario regions, the Catawba would\r\nrival the Concord. Because of late ripening in New York this variety is\r\nat its best only about the Central Lakes and on land extending back from\r\nthe water to an altitude of one hundred feet above the lake surface;\r\nhere as fine Catawbas are grown as anywhere in the world. As to soil, it\r\nthrives in sand, gravel or clay provided there be an abundance of food\r\nand humus, good drainage and plenty of bottom heat.\r\n\r\nOf all the commercial grapes grown in New York Catawba is the best\r\nkeeper, lasting until March or later. Because of its fine quality it\r\noften brings a higher price than other varieties and its reputation as a\r\ndessert grape would be still better were it not too often picked before\r\nfully ripe and therefore sour and unpalatable. The Catawba is the\r\nstandard red grape in the markets, and other red varieties are often\r\nsold under its name. It makes a good light-colored wine, which as has\r\nbeen said, is largely used as a base for champagne. The vine is\r\nvigorous, hardy and productive but the foliage and fruit are susceptible\r\nto fungi and this constitutes the chief defect of the variety and\r\naccounts for the decline and the passing out of Catawba in many of the\r\ngrape regions of the past in the United States and its unpopularity in\r\nsome of the grape regions of the present. In its botanical characters,\r\nin its adaptation, and in its susceptibilities it suggests _Vitis\r\nvinifera_ crossed with _Vitis labrusca_, a possibility to be discussed\r\nin a later paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe characters of Catawba seem readily transmissible to its offspring\r\nand, beside having a number of pure-bred descendants which more or less\r\nresemble it, it is one of the parents of a still greater number of\r\ncross-breeds which, as a rule, inherit many of its characters. As with\r\nCatawba, most of its progeny show Vinifera characters; as intermittent\r\ntendrils, the Vinifera color of foliage, a vinous flavor wholly or\r\nnearly free from foxiness, and the susceptibilities of Labrusca-Vinifera\r\nhybrids to certain insects, fungi, and environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nCatawba was introduced by John Adlum of the District of Columbia about\r\n1823. Adlum secured cuttings of this variety from a Mrs. Scholl of\r\nClarksburgh, Montgomery County, Maryland, in the spring of 1819. This\r\nvine had been planted by Mrs. Scholl's husband, who had since died. He\r\nhad always called it Catawba, but the family did not know from what\r\nsource it had been secured. Owing to the statement of a German priest\r\nthat it was the same as the Tokay of Hungary, Mr. Adlum called it by\r\nthat name. Some years later, when he found this to be a mistake, he\r\nchanged the name back to Catawba. Adlum found the same variety on a\r\ntrellis on land belonging to a Mr. J. Johnston, near Fredericktown,\r\nMaryland. He also found a similar variety on a farm of his in Lycoming\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania, which he introduced under the name of Muncy. Later\r\nthese two varieties were judged to be identical. Neither Adlum nor\r\nPrince was able to trace the origin of Catawba, though both were among\r\nthe chief viticulturists of their day, were instrumental in distributing\r\nthis variety, and had correspondents in all parts of the Union.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, S. Mosher of Saloma Springs, Kentucky, wrote an article in the\r\n_Western Horticultural Review_, giving an account of the finding of the\r\noriginal vine by Dr. Solomon Beach, in 1821, on the farm of William\r\nMurry, about ten miles from Asheville, Buncombe County, North Carolina.\r\nThe Murrys informed Beach that the grape was an old variety in the\r\nneighborhood and that cuttings and roots had been sent to various\r\nplaces. This story was later confirmed by Ravenel, who talked with a son\r\nof the original Murry and was told that General Davy, in 1807, then\r\nUnited States Senator from South Carolina, had secured some of the vines\r\nand had carried some of them to Washington. This would account for its\r\nfalling into the hands of Adlum. It must be said, however, that it\r\nappears strange that none of the many correspondents of Adlum or Prince,\r\nsome of whom lived not very far from where the Catawba was supposed to\r\nhave been found, had heard of this variety. That the Murrys had a vine\r\ngrowing on their farm of peculiar excellence, is probable; that it was\r\nCatawba is by no means certain. All that can be said is that the origin\r\nof Catawba is not positively known.\r\n\r\nCatawba was introduced into the grape region around Cincinnati by\r\nLongworth in 1825. The favorable reports of the variety from this region\r\nundoubtedly did much to secure its early and wide distribution. In most\r\nsections it was compared with the Alexander or Cape grape, and proved\r\nitself easily the superior in both vine and fruit characters. Up to the\r\ntime of the introduction of Concord, Catawba was the most popular\r\nAmerican grape cultivated. After that time, the earlier season and\r\nsuperior vine of the former variety enabled it to supplant Catawba in\r\nmany sections. The Catawba was placed on the grape list in the first\r\nAmerican Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1852.\r\n\r\nThe species to which Catawba belongs is uncertain. It is generally\r\nclassed as Labrusca, but practically all of those who have raised large\r\nnumbers of seedlings of the variety are of the opinion that it has some\r\nVinifera blood in its composition. The general appearance of the vine\r\nwould indicate Labrusca, but the vinous flavor of the fruit, the\r\nsusceptibility to mildew, the appearance of occasional seeds, and the\r\ncharacter of the seedlings, many of which resemble Vinifera more than\r\nthe parent, all indicate that there is a strain of Vinifera present.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to medium, hardy, productive, subject to mildew in\r\n     unfavorable seasons. Canes of average length, numerous, rather\r\n     thick, moderately dark brown with slight ash-gray tinge; nodes\r\n     enlarged, sometimes slightly flattened; internodes of mean length;\r\n     diaphragm rather thin; pith rather large; shoots slightly\r\n     pubescent; tendrils continuous, of fair length, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds intermediate in size and thickness, short, conical to\r\n     nearly obtuse, open moderately late. Young leaves tinged rose\r\n     carmine on upper and lower sides. Leaves large, of average\r\n     thickness; upper surface rather light green, dull, moderately\r\n     smooth; lower surface grayish-white, heavily pubescent; veins well\r\n     defined; lobes sometimes three, terminal lobe acute; petiolar sinus\r\n     deep, narrow to medium; basal sinus often lacking; lateral sinus of\r\n     average depth, narrow; teeth rather shallow, narrow. Flowers\r\n     fertile, open rather late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit late, one of the best keepers, lasting until March or later.\r\n     Clusters large to medium, rather long, usually broad, nearly\r\n     cylindrical to tapering, single-shouldered to sometimes\r\n     double-shouldered, rather loose to compact; peduncle of average\r\n     length, rather slender; pedicel variable in length, intermediate in\r\n     thickness, covered with but few small, inconspicuous warts,\r\n     considerably swollen at point of attachment to berry; brush short,\r\n     pale green. Berries intermediate in size, oval to roundish, dull\r\n     purplish-red, covered with a moderate amount of lilac bloom, not\r\n     inclined to drop from pedicel, firm. Skin rather thick, variable in\r\n     toughness, slightly adheres to pulp, with no pigment, somewhat\r\n     astringent. Flesh green, translucent, juicy, fine-grained, slightly\r\n     tough to soft, depending upon age, vinous, often sprightly with\r\n     some foxiness, sweet and rich, very good in quality. Seeds separate\r\n     easily from flesh, frequently abortive, average two, medium size,\r\n     broad, often with a short prominent neck, distinctly notched,\r\n     blunt, brownish; raphe obscure; chalaza large, above center, oval\r\n     to nearly roundish, rather distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAYUGA.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera?)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Rural N.

Although known\r\nsince 1886, the Cayuga was never widely distributed in New York and is\r\nnow rarely found.\r\n\r\nThe variety was originated by D. S. Marvin, Watertown, New York, from\r\nseed of Adirondac. Marvin, in a personal letter, says that the usually\r\nimputed parentage of Eumelan crossed with Adirondac is a mistake, and\r\nrefers to another variety. Bush gives Sharon as a synonym of Cayuga but\r\nthis appears to be an error.\r\n\r\n     Vine not vigorous, lacks in hardiness, an uncertain bearer,\r\n     unproductive. Tendrils continuous, bifid. Leaves medium to small,\r\n     inclined to dark green, thick. Flowers vary from nearly fertile to\r\n     almost sterile, open in mid-season; stamens upright. Fruit ripens\r\n     as early as Champion. Clusters variable in size, usually short and\r\n     not shouldered, not uniform in compactness. Berries medium to large\r\n     but some years often small and seedless, much like Isabella in\r\n     shape, unattractive in color, ranging from dull reddish-purple to\r\n     blackish, covered with blue bloom. Flesh tender, vinous, mild from\r\n     skin to center, variable in flavor and quality, ranking from fair\r\n     to very good. The seed-coat is often rough and warty.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTENNIAL.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Aestivalis, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt._, =1881=:66. =2.= _Bush.

Its chief meritorious attributes are high\r\nquality and attractive appearance; while its faults, which greatly\r\noutweigh its merits, are lack of vigor, susceptibility to fungi, and\r\nlack of hardiness. Centennial is much like Delaware and is surpassed by\r\nit in nearly all respects.\r\n\r\nThe variety was originated by D. S. Marvin, of Watertown, New York. It\r\nis a cross between a Labrusca seedling of Marvin's and a seedling of\r\nEumelan. It was first fruited in 1875, and was introduced in 1882 by the\r\noriginator. Vines were received by this Station in 1883. The tenderness\r\nand lateness of ripening of Centennial, as well as its botanical\r\ncharacters, indicate Vinifera blood.\r\n\r\nThe following description is a compilation from several sources:\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, somewhat tender, fairly productive. Leaves rounded,\r\n     slightly three-lobed, smooth. Clusters medium to small, compact,\r\n     tapering or cylindrical, sometimes slightly shouldered.

Small plantations of\r\nit still exist in New York, but it is rapidly passing out of\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nChallenge was originated about 1860 by Archer Moore, of Hammonton, New\r\nJersey. He supposed it to have come from seed of Concord fertilized by\r\nRoyal Muscadine. The variety was introduced by William F. Bassett of the\r\nsame place. We do not have a vine of Challenge growing on the Station\r\ngrounds, and the description written below is compiled from various\r\nsources.\r\n\r\n     Vine very vigorous; shoots slender, long.

Champion and Hartford are\r\nrivals as early market grapes and for the distinction of being the\r\npoorest in quality of all commonly cultivated grapes. The variety under\r\nconsideration is sourer and less agreeable to the taste than many wild\r\ngrapes. The characters which have kept it in cultivation are earliness,\r\ngood shipping qualities, though it does not keep well, productiveness,\r\nattractive appearance, and a vigorous hardy vine. The hardiness of the\r\nvine and its short season of fruit development and maturity make it a\r\ngood variety for northern and cold climates. This grape is best, in\r\nappearance of fruit, in quality, and in the quantity produced, on a\r\ncomparatively light sandy soil. As grape consumers become more\r\nappreciative of quality, Champion will be grown less and less.\r\n\r\nThe origin of Champion is unknown. It was first grown about 1870 in New\r\nYork. In 1871 Elliott acknowledged receipt of specimens of this variety\r\nfrom William Chorlton of Staten Island. It was at that time generally\r\nknown as Tallman or Tallman's Seedling. At about the same time it was\r\nbeing propagated and sold by R. J. Donnelly and J. I. Stone of\r\nCharlotte, Monroe County, as Champion. Although many efforts have been\r\nmade, no one has succeeded in tracing the variety to the original vine.\r\nAt one time it was stated to have originated in the vicinity of New\r\nOrleans, Louisiana, but later the southern Champion was found to be a\r\ndifferent variety. This variety was early introduced into Canada where\r\nit was known as Beaconsfield, owing to its being first planted in that\r\ncountry in a large vineyard owned by a gentleman of that name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHAMPION]\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to very vigorous, hardy, productive to very\r\n     productive. Canes intermediate in length and number, of average\r\n     size, rather dark brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes\r\n     medium to below in length; diaphragm thick; pith nearly large;\r\n     shoots pubescent; tendrils continuous, inclined to long, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds of medium size, short, rather thick, obtuse to conical,\r\n     open in mid-season.

Leaves medium to large, intermediate in\r\n     thickness; upper surface dark green, dull, rugose; lower surface\r\n     dull gray often with trace of bronze, slightly downy; veins\r\n     indistinct; lobes usually three, often obscurely five, terminal\r\n     lobe acute; petiolar sinus deep to medium, of average width; teeth\r\n     of fair depth, shallow. Flowers fertile, open medium early; stamens\r\n     upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens early, three weeks or more before Concord and about a\r\n     week before Hartford, ships well but does not keep well, as its\r\n     season is very short.

Inasmuch as it originated, and for\r\nfifteen years has been known, in the region where the Concord reigns\r\nsupreme, and has not yet come into prominence, it is fair to assume that\r\nit has some weakness and that the parent will remain dominant.\r\n\r\nChautauqua is a volunteer seedling of Concord found in a Concord\r\nvineyard near Brocton, Chautauqua County, New York, by H. T. Bashtite\r\nwho sent vines of it to this Station in 1892.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, not always hardy, not productive. Tendrils\r\n     continuous, mostly trifid. Leaves large, irregularly roundish, dark\r\n     green; lower surface tinged with bronze. Flowers semi-fertile to\r\n     nearly fertile, open in mid-season or earlier; stamens upright.\r\n     Fruit ripens in mid-season or a few days earlier.

In\r\nthese general observations we need to consider but the northern one of\r\nthe two grapes. This variety has long been grown in New Jersey and in\r\nNew York and in both States is highly esteemed as a wine grape, the\r\nresulting wine being well flavored and of a dark inky-red color. The\r\nfruit is remarkable in coloring very early and in ripening very late.\r\nThe vine is hardy, very vigorous, succeeds in various soils and since it\r\nbears grafts well it seems an excellent sort upon which to graft\r\nvarieties which do not thrive on their own roots. It is self-sterile and\r\nmust be planted with some other variety to set fruit well. Clinton makes\r\nan excellent pollenizer because it blooms at the same time, and because\r\ntwo wine grapes may be thus grown together. In spite of its good\r\nqualities, Clevener is hardly holding its own in the commercial\r\nvineyards of the State and it is not a desirable fruit for the amateur\r\nwho wants a table grape.\r\n\r\nThe Clevener here described has been raised in the vicinity of Egg\r\nHarbor, New Jersey, for about forty years, but its place and time of\r\norigin are unknown. It is generally considered to be a Riparia but the\r\ncontinuous tendrils and other botanical characters indicate a strong\r\nadmixture of Labrusca blood and possibly Aestivalis or Bicolor as the\r\nshoots and canes show considerable bloom.\r\n\r\nThe other variety under the name Clevener is a southern grape strongly\r\nresembling Rulander or Louisiana. Opinions differ as to whether it be\r\nof Aestivalis or Bourquiniana blood. This variety is unknown in New\r\nYork and of its origin and history there is no information.\r\n\r\n     Vine a rampant grower, hardy, medium to productive, somewhat\r\n     subject to attacks of leaf-hoppers. Canes long, numerous, rather\r\n     thick, dark reddish-brown, covered with a slight amount of bloom;\r\n     tendrils continuous, bifid. Foliage very healthy; leaves unusually\r\n     large, intermediate in thickness, dark green with well defined ribs\r\n     showing through the thin pubescence of the under surface. Flowers\r\n     sterile, open very early; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens late, and appears to keep well. Clusters do not always\r\n     fill well, small to medium, rather short and slender, irregularly\r\n     tapering, often with a medium-sized single shoulder, variable in\r\n     compactness. Berries small to medium, roundish to slightly\r\n     flattened, black, rather glossy, covered with blue bloom,\r\n     persistent, firm. Skin rather tough, thinnish and inclined to\r\n     crack, adheres slightly to the pulp, contains an unusually large\r\n     amount of dark purplish-red pigment. Flesh reddish-green,\r\n     moderately juicy, rather tender and soft, fine-grained, very\r\n     slightly aromatic, spicy, neither so sprightly nor so high-flavored\r\n     as other varieties of the same season, not good enough in flavor\r\n     and quality in general for dessert purposes. Seeds separate rather\r\n     easily from the pulp, intermediate in size and length, medium to\r\n     above in width, notched, nearly sharp-pointed, dark brown; raphe\r\n     shows as a very small cord; chalaza large, at center or slightly\r\n     above, irregularly oval, distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLINTON.\r\n\r\n(Riparia, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= Adlum, =1823=:140. =2.= Ib., =1828=:176. =3.= Prince,\r\n     =1830=:179. =4.= Rafinesque, =1830=:11. =5.= _N.

It has historical interest if not intrinsic\r\nvalue, for it played an important part in the beginning of American\r\nviticulture. Most viticulturists have ascribed to Clinton the\r\ndistinction of being the first cultivated \"variety of _Vitis riparia_\"\r\nbut without question this honor belongs to the Worthington of Adlum and\r\nPrince, with a strong probability that Clinton may be Worthington\r\nrenamed. But it was as Clinton that _Vitis riparia_ was disseminated for\r\ngeneral culture and it is the name Clinton that stands at the parental\r\nhead of the long list of grapes now under cultivation from this species;\r\nand so, in spite of its being the usurper of Worthington's honor, and\r\nwhether or not it be the older variety under an assumed name, it is\r\nprobably best that Clinton continue to be considered the first of its\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nClinton came into prominence, and brought the species to which it\r\nbelongs to the notice of grape-growers, because of its vigor, hardiness\r\nand fruitfulness; and, later, its popularity was added to because of its\r\nimmunity to phylloxera. The vine is so vigorous that its growth is rank\r\nand because of this and the straggling habit of growth it is very\r\ndifficult to keep under control on trellises and in most situations\r\nneeds a great deal of room. It can be grown in as high a latitude as any\r\nof our native grapes but it blooms so early in the spring that the\r\nblossoms are often caught by late frosts in northern climates. The\r\nimmunity of Clinton to phylloxera led to its being planted very largely\r\nin France some years ago but it has now been discarded for better direct\r\nproducers in that country. The defects of the variety are: The fruit is\r\ntoo small and sour and the seeds and skins too prominent for a market\r\ngrape and the wine is not of high quality, being too raucous, though the\r\nharshness disappears somewhat with age. The fruit colors early in the\r\nseason but does not ripen until late and therefore suffers greatly from\r\nbirds. A slight touch of frost is supposed to improve its flavor. This\r\nvariety is so sensitive to calcareous soils that where lime or chalk\r\nabounds the vines often die out after a few years. Clinton bears grafts\r\nwell, making a quick and firm union with Labruscas and Viniferas, and\r\nroots very freely from cuttings.\r\n\r\nThis variety has been much used in grape-breeding and its blood can be\r\ntraced in many valuable varieties, among which are most of the desirable\r\nwine grapes for the North. The offspring of Clinton are usually very\r\nhardy and this, taken with other desirable characters, makes it an\r\nexceptionally good starting-point for breeding grapes for northern\r\nlatitudes. Its seedlings often show intermittent characters and\r\notherwise indicate a strong strain of Labrusca.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLINTON]\r\n\r\nClinton began to attract attention in New York about 1840. J. W.\r\nBissell, of Rochester, in the _Horticulturist_ of January, 1848, writes\r\nthat the vine from which cuttings were taken was found by L. B.\r\nLangworthy, in the garden of a Mr. Peebles above Waterford on the\r\nHudson. The name Clinton was given by Langworthy, who introduced it to\r\nthe trade around Rochester about 1835. There were other cultivated\r\nvarieties growing in the Peebles garden and the Clinton was not supposed\r\nto be a seedling. Although this account of the origin of the Clinton was\r\npublished in the then most popular horticultural publication in the\r\nUnited States, there were no denials nor corrections made in any of the\r\nsucceeding numbers. In 1863 there appeared in the _Elmira Advertiser_ an\r\naccount of the origin of this variety in which it was stated that the\r\nseed from which this variety had sprung was planted by Hugh White, then\r\na member of Congress, in his father's garden in Whitesboro, in 1819. Two\r\nyears later, so the story runs, when he was a junior in Hamilton\r\nCollege, Clinton, New York, White transplanted the vine east of the\r\nhouse of Dr. Noyes, with whom he then boarded. There were no denials of\r\nthis report, probably on account of the fact that the introducer at\r\nRochester was dead; and the account and Whitesboro as the place of\r\norigin were later generally accepted by horticultural writers. In 1852\r\nthe Ohio Pomological Society determined that the Worthington and the\r\nClinton grapes were identical. Later this was generally accepted by\r\nviticulturists as being correct. The Worthington is an old sort known to\r\nAdlum and Prince, and was said by the latter to have originated in the\r\nvicinity of Annapolis, Maryland.\r\n\r\nClinton was placed on the grape list of the American Pomological Society\r\nfruit catalog in 1862, where it has since been retained.\r\n\r\nClinton is usually considered a Riparia, as most of the botanical\r\ncharacters indicate this species. However, occasional canes with\r\ncontinuous tendrils are characteristic of Labrusca.\r\n\r\n     Vine a rank grower, healthy, hardy, productive. Canes long,\r\n     numerous, slender to medium, brown to reddish-brown; nodes\r\n     enlarged, slightly flattened; internodes of average length;\r\n     diaphragm thick to medium; pith large; shoots smooth; tendrils\r\n     usually intermittent but sometimes continuous, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds rather large and short, thick, obtuse to conical, open\r\n     early.

It has the characteristic foliage and habit of growth of\r\nits parent but is earlier by at least a week, is of much higher quality\r\nand lacks somewhat the foxiness of most Labruscas. Colerain is sprightly\r\nand vinous and neither seeds nor skins are as objectionable as in the\r\nparent variety; the fruit hangs well to the vine and keeps as well as\r\nmost of the varieties of its class but owing to its tender pulp does not\r\nship well. It is reported to be more or less unproductive in some\r\nlocalities. While Colerain has not attained commercial importance, it is\r\nrecognized as well worthy a place in home vineyards, and for this reason\r\nand because it is one of the best if not the best of the white seedlings\r\nof Concord it is given the honor of a color-plate and full description\r\nin _The Grapes of New York_.\r\n\r\nDavid Bundy of Colerain, Belmont County, Ohio, produced Colerain from\r\nseed of Concord planted in 1880. The variety was soon after introduced\r\nby the Colerain Grape Company of Colerain, Ohio.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, usually hardy, healthy, not always\r\n     productive.

Young leaves lightly tinged on lower side and\r\n     along margin of upper side with a faint trace of carmine. Leaves of\r\n     average size, nearly thick; upper surface light green, dull,\r\n     moderately smooth; lower surface slightly bronze, downy; veins\r\n     rather distinct; leaf not lobed, terminus acute; petiolar sinus\r\n     shallow to medium, usually wide; basal and lateral sinuses very\r\n     shallow when present; teeth shallow, of average width. Flowers\r\n     fertile, opening in mid-season or earlier; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens a week or more earlier than Concord, keeps fairly well\r\n     but does not ship well.

JUMBO (1). _Jumbo_ (2, 3).\r\n\r\nColumbian Imperial is a showy, reddish-black, Labrusca-Riparia hybrid\r\nchiefly remarkable for the great size of its berries; though the vine is\r\nso exceptionally healthy and vigorous as to give it prominence for these\r\ncharacters. The variety has remarkably thick, leathery leaves which seem\r\nalmost proof against either insects or fungi. The quality of the fruit,\r\nhowever, is very inferior and the clusters are uneven as to the number\r\nof berries and these shell off readily. The only possible value of the\r\nvariety is for exhibition purposes and for breeding to secure the\r\ndesirable characters named above. Columbian Imperial is a frequent\r\nadornment of the salesbook of the fruit tree agents and the panegyrics\r\nheaped upon it by misinformed or unscrupulous salesmen have given it a\r\nrather wide distribution in the gardens of the amateur where it has no\r\nplace whatever.\r\n\r\nThe parentage of Columbian Imperial is unknown. The fruit was originated\r\nby J. S. McKinley, Morgan, Orient P. O., Ohio, in 1885. It was\r\nintroduced by the Columbian Grape Company, of Kingston, Ohio, under the\r\nname Columbian, also by J. R. Johnson of Dallas, Texas, under the name\r\nColumbian Imperial.

The most widely grown of the grapes of this\r\ncontinent, it also represents the dominant type of our native species\r\nand with its offspring, pure-bred and cross-bred, furnishes seventy-five\r\nper ct. or more of the grapes of eastern America. In New York,\r\napproximately seventy-five per ct. of all the grapes grown are Concords\r\nalone. The preeminently meritorious character of Concord, which has\r\nenabled it to take first place in American viticulture, is the\r\nelasticity of its constitution whereby it adapts itself to varying\r\nconditions; thus the Concord is grown with more or less profit in every\r\ngrape-growing State in the Union and to an extent not possible with any\r\nother grape. It succeeds on a greater number of soils than any other\r\nvariety. In the Chautauqua grape region there are six distinct types of\r\nsoil upon which grapes are grown and the Concord is the leading grape on\r\neach of them.\r\n\r\nA second character which commends Concord as a commercial variety is its\r\nhigh degree of fruitfulness, as it gives large crops year in and year\r\nout. Added to the above points of superiority are hardiness; ability to\r\nwithstand the ravages of both diseases and insects; comparative\r\nearliness and therefore certainty of maturity in northern regions; fair\r\nsize of bunch and berry, good color, and an abundance of bloom, making a\r\nmost handsome grape. The Concord leaves out and blossoms somewhat late\r\nin the spring and does not therefore often suffer from spring frosts and\r\nthe fruit is not easily injured by late frosts and hangs well on the\r\nvine.\r\n\r\nThe Concord is not, however, without faults. Its quality is not high,\r\nthe grapes lack richness, delicacy of flavor and aroma, and have a foxy\r\ntaste disagreeable to many; on the other hand, the fruit is sprightly\r\nand refreshing and does not cloy the appetite as do richer grapes. The\r\nseeds and skin of Concord are objectionable, the seeds being large and\r\nabundant and difficult to separate from the flesh and the skin is tough\r\nand unpleasantly astringent. The Concord does not keep nor ship well as\r\ncompared with grapes having Vinifera blood and it rapidly loses flavor\r\nafter ripening; the skin is inclined to crack and the berries to shell\r\nfrom the stems after picking. Concord is but slightly resistant to\r\nphylloxera and in calcareous soils is subject to chlorosis. It requires\r\na rich soil and thrives best on a virgin soil; thus, in the Chautauqua\r\nregion of this State, much concern is now felt because of the failing\r\nvineyards, most of which should not as yet have reached their prime.\r\nWhile Concord is grown in the South, it is essentially a northern grape,\r\nbecoming susceptible to fungi in southern climates and suffering from\r\nphylloxera in dry, warm soils.\r\n\r\nConcord is a table grape and, to use an oft quoted expression coined by\r\nHorace Greeley, it is \"the grape for the millions.\" It can be produced\r\nso cheaply that no other grape can compete with it in the markets. The\r\ndominance of Concord is not wholly desirable for viticulture, as by\r\nkeeping out better varieties, the consumer is prevented from obtaining\r\ngrapes high in quality; and by giving the grower a feeling of\r\nsufficiency in having this sort, other varieties do not receive the\r\nconsideration they deserve. The variety is used somewhat for making red\r\nwines and a white wine as a base for champagne but it is a poor wine\r\ngrape, as much sugar must be added to attain the amount of alcohol\r\nnecessary for a good wine and the foxy taste is not a pleasant flavor.\r\nGrape juice is made almost entirely from Concords and during the past\r\nfew years many carloads of grapes have been used in the Chautauqua\r\nregion for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONCORD]\r\n\r\nThe botanical characters of Concord indicate that it is a pure-bred\r\nLabrusca; thus the seed with obscure raphe and chalaza, the pubescence\r\non the under surface of the leaf, the flesh characters of the fruit, the\r\ncontinuous tendrils, the diaphragm, all belong to _Vitis labrusca_.\r\nThere are those, however, who maintain that it is possibly a\r\nLabrusca-Vinifera hybrid, basing their claim upon the upright stamens,\r\nthe characters of some of the seedlings, and the opinion expressed by\r\nBull that a Catawba vine growing near by had fertilized the seed from\r\nwhich Concord was raised.\r\n\r\nConcord is a virile variety, having begotten a great number of valuable\r\noffspring, both as pure-breeds and as cross-breeds. To these it has\r\nseemingly transmitted its characters to a high degree. The reader who\r\ntakes the pains to look them up will find that many of these, even of\r\nthe pure-breeds, are white and that they are usually of higher quality\r\nthan the parent, indicating a white ancestor of Concord in which high\r\nquality was possibly correlated with the light color.\r\n\r\nThe seed of a wild grape was planted in the fall of 1843 by E. W.\r\nBull[173] of Concord, Massachusetts, from which fruit was borne in 1849.\r\nThe wild grape from which the seed came had been transplanted from\r\nbeside a field fence to the garden in which there was at least another\r\ngrape, the Catawba, and the wild vine was open to cross-pollination. One\r\nof these seedlings was named Concord and the variety was exhibited\r\nbefore the Massachusetts Horticultural Society in the fall of 1852. The\r\nnew grape was introduced in the spring of 1854 by Hovey & Co., of\r\nBoston. From the time of its introduction the growth of this variety in\r\npopularity was phenomenal. In 1854, the year of its introduction, it was\r\nplaced on the grape list of the American Pomological Society fruit\r\ncatalog as one of the \"new varieties which promise well.\" In 1858 it was\r\nplaced on the regular list of recommended sorts where it has since been\r\nretained. Husmann states, in the winter of 1855, that he secured buds at\r\nHermann, Missouri, from Soulard of Galena, Illinois. In other words,\r\nits culture had spread halfway across the continent in the brief period\r\nof a year. Before 1860, vineyards of Concord had been planted in\r\nChautauqua County, this State. In 1865 it was awarded a prize by the\r\nAmerican Institute known as the Greeley prize, from its donor, Horace\r\nGreeley, as the best grape for general cultivation.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to very vigorous, hardy, healthy, usually productive\r\n     of heavy crops.

It is noted, too, for its strong, branching root system.\r\nWith good foliage and good roots it is not surprising that it is a\r\nvigorous, thrifty grower--if anything surpassing its parent in vigor of\r\ngrowth. The canes are so rough as to be almost spiny indicating,\r\nseemingly, outbursts of growth-force. The Cottage is of better quality\r\nthan its parent having far less foxiness and a richer, more delicate\r\nflavor. It is given credit, too, of being a better shipper and a better\r\nkeeper and is from one to two weeks earlier. Its good qualities are\r\noffset, however, by the fact that it lacks in soil adaptability, is\r\ncomparatively unproductive, and ripens unevenly. It blooms much earlier\r\nthan Concord. Cottage is recommended as an early grape of the Concord\r\ntype for the garden and a standard variety for northern localities. The\r\nvariety is widely distributed in varietal vineyards.\r\n\r\nCottage is another of E. W. Bull's seedlings, having been produced by\r\nhim from seed of Concord.

The name Creveling came from a family\r\nof that name, who cultivated the variety and may possibly have\r\noriginated it. It was placed upon the grape list of the American\r\nPomological Society fruit catalog in 1867 and dropped from their list in\r\n1899. It is still widely cultivated in varietal vineyards.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, not quite hardy, usually not very productive. Canes\r\n     long, above medium in number, rather thick, dark reddish-brown;\r\n     nodes slightly enlarged, flattened; internodes medium to long;\r\n     diaphragm thick; pith large; shoots glabrous; tendrils usually\r\n     continuous, long, trifid to bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds rather large, short, thick, obtuse, open in mid-season.\r\n     Young leaves tinged on upper and lower sides with rose-carmine.\r\n     Leaves below medium to large, thick; upper surface dark green,\r\n     dull, slightly rugose; lower surface pale green, rather pubescent;\r\n     veins somewhat prominent; lobes usually three, sometimes obscurely\r\n     five, terminal lobe acute to blunt; petiolar sinus deep to\r\n     narrow, closed and sometimes overlapping; basal sinus very shallow\r\n     when present; lateral sinus rather shallow, narrow; teeth shallow,\r\n     of average width. Flowers sometimes on plan of six, sterile, open\r\n     in mid-season or earlier; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: CREVELING]\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens a few days later than Hartford, does not keep well.\r\n     Clusters resemble Isabella in general appearance, good size, medium\r\n     to long, rather broad, irregularly tapering, usually\r\n     single-shouldered the shoulder often being connected to the cluster\r\n     by a long stem, loose; peduncle long, rather slender, often with a\r\n     distinct reddish tinge; pedicel variable in length, thick, usually\r\n     with no warts, wide at point of attachment to berry; brush\r\n     intermediate in length, thick, dark wine-color. Berries medium to\r\n     large, oval, dull black, covered with heavy blue bloom, persistent,\r\n     rather firm. Skin thick, tough, adheres considerably to the pulp,\r\n     with a moderate amount of wine-colored pigment, astringent. Flesh\r\n     pale green, translucent, juicy, very stringy, tender, coarse,\r\n     somewhat foxy, sweet at skin to tart at center, good in quality.\r\n     Seeds separate rather easily, one to five in number, average two or\r\n     three, above medium in size, broad, slightly notched, intermediate\r\n     in length, blunt, light brown; raphe shows as a narrow groove;\r\n     chalaza of fair size, at center or slightly above, oval, obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROTON.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca, Bourquiniana.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Am.

The accompanying\r\ncolor-plate does not do it justice as grown at its best, as it shows a\r\nloose, straggling bunch, a characteristic of the variety only when\r\npoorly grown. Unfortunately it has the fault of being difficult to grow\r\nwell, being adapted to but few soils and proving unfruitful, weak in\r\ngrowth, precariously tender, and somewhat subject to mildew and rot in\r\nunfavorable situations. But when well grown the consensus of opinion\r\namong viticulturists is that it has few superiors among white grapes. It\r\nhas a sweet, delicate Vinifera flavor, with melting flesh which readily\r\nseparates from the few seeds. The fruit hangs on the vines until frost,\r\nand keeps well into the winter. The Croton is among green grapes what\r\nits parent, the Delaware, is among red grapes. In spite of its high\r\nquality it has never become widely distributed, failing utterly as a\r\ncommercial variety, quality counting for but little in grape markets.\r\nIf this delicious fruit is to be saved to cultivation it must be by the\r\nhands of the amateur.\r\n\r\nCroton came from Stephen W. Underhill[174] of Croton Point, New York,\r\nfrom seed of Delaware pollinated by Chasselas de Fontainbleau. The seed\r\nwas planted in the spring of 1863 and the vine fruited for the first\r\ntime in 1865. The grape was first exhibited at the Massachusetts\r\nHorticultural Society meeting in 1868. It was placed on the grape list\r\nof the American Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1871 but was\r\ndropped in 1883, chiefly on account of its susceptibility to fungal\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, often somewhat tender, usually productive,\r\n     subject to disease in unfavorable locations. Canes long, numerous,\r\n     thick, rather dark reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, usually not\r\n     flattened; internodes medium to short; diaphragm very thick; pith\r\n     large; shoots glabrous; tendrils intermittent, long, bifid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROTON]\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds large, prominent, long, of average thickness, conical,\r\n     open late. Young leaves tinged on lower side and at margin of upper\r\n     side with faint carmine. Foliage remains until late in the season;\r\n     leaves of medium size, intermediate in thickness; upper surface\r\n     light green, dull, nearly smooth to rugose; lower surface pale\r\n     green, slightly cobwebby or hairy; veins indistinct; lobes five in\r\n     number, terminal lobe blunt to acute; basal sinus of average depth,\r\n     rather narrow; lateral sinus inclined to deep and nearly narrow;\r\n     petiolar sinus medium deep, narrow, often closed and overlapping;\r\n     teeth inclined to shallow, wide. Flowers fertile, open late;\r\n     stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens in mid-season or later, keeps fairly well. Clusters\r\n     not uniform, very large to medium, longish, rather slender,\r\n     irregularly tapering, often with an unusually heavy single\r\n     shoulder, very loose to medium; peduncle long, thick; pedicel\r\n     somewhat long, thick, covered with few, small, inconspicuous warts;\r\n     brush intermediate in length, greenish. Berries irregular in size\r\n     averaging about medium, roundish to slightly elongated, light\r\n     green, changing to yellowish-green, covered with thin gray bloom,\r\n     persistent, slightly soft. Skin thin, rather tough, adheres very\r\n     slightly to the pulp, contains no pigment. Flesh green, somewhat\r\n     transparent, very juicy, melting, vinous, pleasant flavor,\r\n     agreeably sweet, good to very good in quality. Seeds separate very\r\n     easily from the flesh, one to three, above medium in size, slightly\r\n     elongated, fair breadth, notched, rather sharply pointed, light\r\n     brown; raphe obscure; chalaza small, above center, irregularly\r\n     circular to oval, indistinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUNNINGHAM.\r\n\r\n(Bourquiniana.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= Prince, =1830=:191. =2.= _U.

It is not now largely grown in France, however,\r\nhaving been superseded by better American varieties for the uses for\r\nwhich it was formerly cultivated. It was much sought for by the French\r\nas a stock for large Vinifera cions, the size of the vine giving an\r\nopportunity for making a good graft. In the South, Cunningham is not\r\nlargely grown as there are several other varieties of its class superior\r\nto it in quality of fruit and in vine characters as well. It seems\r\neverywhere to have been an exceedingly capricious grower and very\r\nparticular as to soil and climate. It is said to make a deep yellow\r\nwine of very good quality. It has little or no value as a table grape.\r\n\r\nCunningham originated in the garden of Jacob Cunningham of Prince Edward\r\nCounty, Virginia, about the year 1812. Cuttings of this vine were sent\r\nby Dr. D. N. Norton of Richmond to Prince in 1829. Prince introduced it\r\nto the public. Its botanical characters mark it as an offshoot of the\r\nHerbemont group of Bourquiniana.\r\n\r\nThe following description is a compilation from several sources:\r\n\r\n     Vine very vigorous, spreading, rather productive, somewhat\r\n     suceptible to mildew. Canes large and long, with stiff reddish\r\n     hairs at base; shoots showing considerable bloom; tendrils\r\n     intermittent, usually trifid. Leaves large, rather thick, roundish,\r\n     entire or slightly lobed; smooth and dark green above,\r\n     yellowish-green below and slightly pubescent; petiolar sinus\r\n     narrow, frequently overlapping. Clusters of medium size, long,\r\n     sometimes shouldered, very compact; peduncle short, strong; pedicel\r\n     long, slender. Berries small, purplish-black with thin, grayish\r\n     bloom. Skin thin, tough with considerable underlying pigment. Flesh\r\n     tender, juicy, sprightly or somewhat acidly sweet. Seeds two to\r\n     five, rather oval; beak short; chalaza distinct; raphe showing as a\r\n     ridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYNTHIANA.\r\n\r\n(Aestivalis, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _U. S. D. A.

There has long been a\r\nheated controversy as to whether this variety differs from Norton. The\r\nbotanical differences between the two varieties are not greater than\r\nmight be attributed to environment, soil, climate and culture; but side\r\nby side the two grapes ripen at different times, and the quality of the\r\nfruit, and more particularly of the wine, is such that the varieties\r\nmust be considered as distinct. The distinction should be maintained for\r\nCynthiana is the better grape of the two. It has been much grown in\r\nFrance for its intrinsic value and in the reconstruction of vineyards\r\ndestroyed by phylloxera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYNTHIANA]\r\n\r\nAs the history given below shows, the variety is an old one but it, with\r\nNorton, was condemned by the early vineyardists because it could be\r\npropagated from cuttings only with the greatest difficulty. Like most of\r\nits species, Cynthiana is somewhat particular as to soil and location,\r\npreferring sandy or gravelly loams and not thriving on clays or\r\nlimestones. While very resistant to phylloxera, it is not now much used\r\nas a resistant stock because of the superiority of varieties of\r\nRupestris and because it is not easily propagated. It is very resistant\r\nto cryptogamic diseases, mildew, black-rot and anthracnose, and is a\r\nstrong, vigorous grower. Its cycle of vegetation is long, the buds\r\nbursting forth early and the fruit maturing very late. It has no value\r\nas a table grape but according to the _Bushberg Catalogue_[175] it is\r\nthe best American grape for red wine. So, too, according to Viala,[176]\r\nthe wine from Cynthiana is the best of all the red wines produced from\r\nAmerican vines. It is said by French wine-makers[177] to contain \"an\r\nexcess of all the elements which constitute the best ordinary wines,\r\ncolor, tannin, acidity, and bouquet,\" and therefore to make a splendid\r\nbase for blending with wine from varieties lacking in the above\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nCynthiana was received, some time in the fifties by Prince of Flushing,\r\nLong Island, from Arkansas where it is said to have been found growing\r\nin the woods. It was sent by Prince to Husmann at Hermann, Missouri,\r\nwhere it did so well and was so highly spoken of by Husmann and his\r\nneighbors that it soon became known to grape-growers. It was placed upon\r\nthe grape list of the American Pomological Society fruit catalog in\r\n1881, where it still remains. Like Norton, Cynthiana is often considered\r\npure Aestivalis, although a strain of some other blood, probably\r\nLabrusca, is apparent. Because of the similarity of this variety and\r\nNorton the one is often grown as the other.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, healthy, hardy, usually a good yielder. Canes medium\r\n     to nearly long, numerous, of average size, dark brown to\r\n     reddish-brown, sometimes with faint ash-gray tinge, surface covered\r\n     with thick blue bloom; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes short\r\n     to medium; diaphragm rather thin; pith of medium size; shoots\r\n     slightly glabrous; tendrils intermittent to continuous, above\r\n     medium in length, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds small, short, slender, pointed to conical.

Clusters medium to small,\r\n     rather long, intermediate in breadth, tapering to cylindrical, not\r\n     very uniform, often single-shouldered, compact; peduncle above\r\n     medium length, small; pedicel rather short and slender, covered\r\n     with numerous warts, enlarged at point of attachment to berry;\r\n     brush short, thick, wine-colored. Berries small, roundish, black,\r\n     covered with a moderate amount of blue bloom, persistent, firm.\r\n     Skin thin, tough, rather adherent to the pulp, contains a slight\r\n     amount of purple pigment, astringent. Flesh darkish green,\r\n     translucent, juicy, tough and solid, spicy, rather tart, poor in\r\n     quality as a dessert grape. Seeds separate with difficulty from the\r\n     pulp, one to six, average three, small, of mean breadth, short,\r\n     blunt, dark brown; raphe distinct, cord-like; chalaza small,\r\n     slightly above center, circular, distinct.

It is probably\r\nnot worth perpetuating.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Stayman, Leavenworth, Kansas, is supposed to have originated\r\nDaisy from seed of Goethe. On account of the fruit characters, Bush\r\nquestions the parentage but as it grows at this Station the reputed\r\nparentage appears to be quite probably correct.\r\n\r\n     Vine intermediate in vigor, not hardy nor productive, an uncertain\r\n     bearer.

Its introduction raised\r\nthe standard of quality in our viticulture to that of the Old World, for\r\nthere is no variety of _Vitis vinifera_ more richly or more delicately\r\nflavored or with a more agreeable aroma than the Delaware. This variety\r\nis rightly used wherever American grapes are grown as the standard\r\nwhereby to gauge the quality of other grapes. Added to high quality it\r\nis endowed with a constitution which enables it to withstand climatic\r\nconditions to which all but the most hardy varieties will succumb, and\r\nso elastic as to adapt it to many soils and conditions, and to bear\r\nunder most situations an abundant crop. All of this makes it, next to\r\nthe Concord, the most popular grape for garden, vineyard and wine-press,\r\nnow grown in the United States. As with the Concord, its introduction\r\ngave American grape-growing a great impetus and it is a question whether\r\nor not, with its high quality, it has not had a more beneficial effect\r\non the viticulture of the country than the Concord.\r\n\r\nBeside the qualities named above for the Delaware, it matures\r\nsufficiently early to make its crops certain, is attractive in\r\nappearance, keeps well on the vine and in the package, ships well and is\r\nmore immune than other commercial varieties to black-rot. Its faults\r\nare: The small size of the vine, slowness of growth, susceptibility of\r\nthe foliage to mildew, its capriciousness in certain soils, and the\r\nsmall size of the berries. The first two faults make it necessary to\r\nplant the vines more closely than other commercial varieties stand. It\r\nsucceeds best in deep, rich, well-drained, warm soils but even on these\r\nit must receive good cultivation, close pruning, and in some cases the\r\nfruit must be thinned. It is, too, a necessity, where mildew is\r\nabundant, to spray with bordeaux mixture which keeps the disease well in\r\ncheck. Birds are very fond of this variety and it suffers in particular\r\nfrom the depredations of robins.\r\n\r\nDelaware is the best American table grape and as such commands a premium\r\nin all of the markets, selling oftentimes for double the price of\r\nConcord. It is also much sought for by wine-makers both for Delaware\r\nwine and for blending in making champagne or other wines of high\r\nquality. It is grown North and South and westward to the Rocky\r\nMountains, and is now proving especially profitable in many southern\r\nlocations as an early grape to ship to northern markets. The Delaware is\r\nan especially desirable grape to cultivate in small gardens because of\r\nits delicious and handsome fruit, its compact habit of growth, and when\r\nin health, its ample and lustrous green, delicately formed leaves which\r\nmake it one of the most ornamental of the grapes.[178]\r\n\r\nDelaware is the parent of an interesting but not particularly valuable\r\nprogeny; none of the pure-bred offspring nearly equal the parent though\r\nmany of them inherit its fine color and high quality. Among its\r\ncross-bred offspring are some notable varieties, all of which are\r\ndescribed in their proper places in this work. An interesting fact\r\nregarding the pure-bred progeny of Delaware is that, so far as we have\r\nrecords, it seems to have given very few black grapes though there are\r\noften white or rose-colored seedlings among them. Even in its cross-bred\r\noffspring, red, or some tint of it greatly predominates, indicating\r\npower in the transmission of color and suggesting the value of this\r\nvariety in breeding red grapes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DELAWARE]\r\n\r\nThe Delaware grape was first brought to notice by Abram Thompson, editor\r\nof the _Delaware Gazette_ of Delaware, Ohio. In the summer of 1849 he\r\nsaw fruit of this variety which had been brought into town from one of\r\nthe neighboring farms. An investigation disclosed that the variety was\r\nbeing raised on the farms of a Mr. Warford and of a Mr. Heath, near the\r\nbanks of the Scioto River, a few miles from the town of Delaware, and\r\nthat Warford had brought the variety from the State of New Jersey more\r\nthan twenty years before. It was known in this neighborhood under the\r\nname of Heath, or Powell. Thompson sent fruit of the variety to A. J.\r\nDowning who gave it the name Delaware, after the town from which the\r\nsamples had been sent. Thompson also brought it to the notice of the\r\nOhio Pomological Society in the autumn of 1851. It was found that the\r\nDelaware vines secured by Warford could be traced back to the garden of\r\nPaul H. Provost, a Swiss of Frenchtown, Kingswood Township, Hunterdon\r\nCounty, New Jersey. Provost, at this time, was dead, and definite\r\ninformation was very difficult to secure as to where he had obtained his\r\nvines. One account was that they had been received from a brother\r\nresiding in Italy, and in deference to this story, the variety was\r\nlocally known as the Italian wine grape. Another story was to the effect\r\nthat they had been brought to Provost's place by a German who had been\r\nin this country only a short time but who had spent this interval with\r\nHare Powell of Philadelphia. Whether the German secured the vines from\r\nthe Old Country or from Powell is uncertain. There was a report that\r\nthey had been secured from Powell and that he in turn had received them\r\nfrom Bland of Virginia. All of the stories as to how the vines came into\r\nProvost's garden lack supporting evidence and some were of the opinion\r\nthat it had grown in the garden as a seedling.\r\n\r\nThe Delaware at once attracted great attention and the horticultural\r\njournals were full of conflicting accounts of its history and of warm\r\ndiscussions as to its botany. In 1856 it was placed on the grape list of\r\nthe American Pomological Society fruit catalog as \"a new variety which\r\npromises well;\" two years later it was placed on the list of recommended\r\nsorts.\r\n\r\nThere is still a difference of opinion as to the botany of this variety.\r\nThe theory advanced by many when it was first introduced, that it is a\r\npure Vinifera, has been abandoned. Millardet and others considered the\r\nDelaware a hybrid between Vinifera, Labrusca, Cinerea and Aestivalis.\r\nMunson holds that it is of Labrusca-Bourquiniana origin with a probable\r\nslight admixture of Vinifera. He further states that he considers\r\nElsinburgh probably one of the parents. Historically this is\r\ncorroborated by the fact that Elsingburgh originated in New Jersey not\r\nfar from where Provost lived.\r\n\r\n     Vine not a strong grower, hardy except in unfavorable locations,\r\n     fairly productive, somewhat subject to leaf-hoppers and mildew.\r\n     Canes medium to below in length, numerous, slender, rather light to\r\n     medium dark brown; nodes slightly enlarged, not flattened;\r\n     internodes rather short; diaphragm intermediate in thickness; pith\r\n     small; shoots glabrous; tendrils intermittent, somewhat short,\r\n     bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds rather small, of average length, slender, pointed to\r\n     conical, prominent, open early.

It is an offspring of Delaware crossed with Catawba, as the\r\nname indicates, and was introduced with the expectation that it would\r\ntake the place of one or the other or both of its parents. However, it\r\nhas made no impress upon the viticulture of this State though it has\r\nbeen tested here and there in the several grape regions during the past\r\nten years. The fruit resembles Catawba, though not as attractive, the\r\nberries averaging smaller, but it ripens almost as early as Delaware, a\r\ngreat point in its favor. The vine, too, is more like Catawba than the\r\nDelaware, being more vigorous and productive than the latter. The\r\nreports of this variety indicate that it is very promising but it seems\r\nnot to be making headway as either a fancy or a commercial fruit\r\nprobably because of characters lacking in the fruit.\r\n\r\nDr. L. C. Chisholm of Spring Hill, Tennessee, produced the Delawba some\r\ntime about 1880 from seed of Delaware fertilized by Catawba. The variety\r\nwas introduced in 1895, after having received high encomiums from\r\nvarious horticultural authorities. The following is a compiled\r\ndescription:\r\n\r\n     Vine usually vigorous and productive, resembling Catawba very\r\n     closely, blooming with Concord. Cluster above medium to large,\r\n     moderately compact, cylindrical or slightly tapering, sometimes\r\n     slightly shouldered. Berries variable in size, ranging from above\r\n     medium to below, of amber color with lilac bloom; skin quite tough.\r\n     Not attractive in appearance. It is self-fertile and ripens its\r\n     berries evenly. Quality good to very good. Ripens shortly after\r\n     Delaware.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVEREAUX.[179]\r\n\r\n(Bourquiniana.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mag.

When it can be grown it is of high\r\nquality and makes a very good wine. The variety is of only historical\r\nand botanical interest. In France the Devereaux was at one time\r\nconsidered a valuable wine grape.\r\n\r\nAn article in the _Horticulturist_[180] for 1857 states that the\r\nDevereaux was found in the woods over forty years before that date by\r\nSamuel M. Devereaux, who lived near Sparta, Georgia. It has been\r\nconsiderably confused with varieties which resemble it. The name\r\nLincoln, in particular, is a questionable synonym which Dr. Curtis of\r\nHillsboro, North Carolina, in a letter to the _Gardener's Monthly_ for\r\n1860,[181] states was found near the junction of the South Fork and\r\nCatawba Rivers by Dr. William McLean. It was known locally under the\r\nnames of McLean and Hart. Later it was sent to Longworth, who gave it\r\nthe name Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions of this variety from various sources are conflicting.\r\nThat given below is copied from the _Bushberg Catalogue_.[182]\r\n\r\n     \"Bunch long, loose, slightly shouldered; berry black, below medium,\r\n     round; skin fine, tender; flesh meaty, juicy without pulp, and\r\n     vinous; quality best.

MOORE'S DIAMOND (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.)\r\n     _Moore's Diamond_ (15, 17).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAMOND]\r\n\r\nDiamond is surpassed in quality and beauty by few other grapes. When to\r\nits desirable fruit characters are added its earliness, hardiness,\r\nproductiveness and vigor it is surpassed by no other green grape.\r\nNiagara is more productive and therefore more profitable in most\r\nlocalities but in many essential characters it falls short of Diamond\r\nand the difference in productiveness is not marked. We usually accord\r\nNiagara first place among green grapes but Diamond rivals it for the\r\nhonor. The former attained high rank not only through merit but by much\r\nadvertisement while Diamond has made its way by merit alone. If we\r\nconsider the wants of the amateur and of the wine-maker as well as those\r\nof the commercial vineyardist, unquestionably Diamond must be accorded a\r\nhigh place among the best all-around grapes.\r\n\r\nDiamond is a diluted hybrid between _Vitis labrusca_ and _Vitis\r\nvinifera_; the touch of the exotic grape given by the Vinifera parents\r\nhas been just sufficient to give it the richness in flavor of the Old\r\nWorld grape and not overcome the refreshing sprightliness of our native\r\nfox grapes. It is without the insipid sweetness of the first or the\r\nfoxiness of the latter. The Vinifera characters are wholly recessive in\r\nvine and foliage, the plant resembling very closely its American parent,\r\nConcord. Diamond is not as highly esteemed as a commercial variety as it\r\ndeserves to be, for beside being of high quality the fruit packs,\r\ncarries and keeps well. Were it known by consumers the demand for it\r\nwould be such that it would command a fancy price and thereby more than\r\nmake up for its lack in fruitfulness, but through the unfortunate\r\ncondition of American fruit markets it is, more often than not, sold as\r\nNiagara and has not therefore established the reputation it should have\r\nin the markets. Diamond is in demand among wine-makers and especially\r\nfor the making of champagnes. For the amateur it has few superiors, the\r\nchief drawback for the small garden being that robins prefer it to most\r\nother varieties and greatly reduce the crop. Diamond is well established\r\nin Canada and can be grown in as great a range of latitude as the\r\nConcord. The vine is as free from the attacks of fungi as the Concord\r\nbut the fruit is a little more susceptible to cryptogamic diseases and\r\nespecially to black-rot, though not attacked by fungi so much as\r\nNiagara.\r\n\r\nThe late Jacob Moore of Brighton, New York, originated Diamond about\r\n1870 from Concord seed fertilized by Iona. It was introduced about 1885.\r\nIt has gained in favor somewhat slowly, and was not placed on the grape\r\nlist of the American Pomological Society fruit catalog until 1897.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, hardy, productive in most locations. Canes\r\n     medium to short, not very numerous, of average thickness, brownish\r\n     or with a slight reddish tinge; nodes slightly enlarged, not\r\n     flattened; internodes medium to short; diaphragm intermediate in\r\n     thickness; pith of medium size; shoots pubescent; tendrils\r\n     intermittent, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds small, short, pointed to conical, open in mid-season.\r\n     Young leaves tinged on lower side and along the edges with red.\r\n     Leaves of average size, thick; upper surface light green, dull,\r\n     nearly smooth; lower surface light bronze, downy; veins distinct;\r\n     lobes usually three in number, indistinct; petiolar sinus very\r\n     shallow; teeth shallow, of mean width.

Its many good qualities warranted the high\r\nhopes of those who first grew it but time revealed so many defects that\r\nthe variety never became widely distributed although few grapes surpass\r\nit, or even equal it, in high quality and handsome appearance when at\r\nits best. Diana is a seedling of Catawba and was hailed as superior to\r\nits parent in quality, appearance and earliness. It was the last named\r\ncharacter that especially commended it to northern grape-growers.\r\nCatawba can be grown in New York only in the most favored locations and\r\nhardly at all in New England even in its southern parts. It fails in the\r\nNorth because the seasons are too short for the fruit to mature. Diana\r\nis about two weeks earlier than Catawba and it was therefore thought\r\nthat the offspring, lacking the defect of the parent, would take the\r\nrank in the North that the older variety held in the South.\r\n\r\nDiana bears a strong resemblance to Catawba, differing chiefly in having\r\na lighter color, a delicate pale red or rose, and in being less pulpy\r\nand more juicy. Usually the bunches, too, are more compact, those of\r\nCatawba as grown in the North being as a rule loose and sometimes\r\nstraggling. The flavor resembles that of Catawba but when well grown and\r\nfully ripe it is more delicate and has less of the wild taste. The\r\ngrapes keep exceptionally well. But its great point of superiority over\r\nCatawba is its earliness; it ripens from ten days to a fortnight\r\nearlier, making possible, as said above, its culture far to the north.\r\nThe defects of Diana are as marked as its good qualities. It is\r\nprecariously tender in cold winters and in regions where Concord goes\r\nwithout protection Diana must be favored. The grapes ripen unevenly,\r\nmany being green when others are mature, and berries and foliage are\r\nboth susceptible to fungi. Lastly it is in many localities a shy bearer\r\nand is almost always capricious. During the first few years in bearing,\r\nthe fruit of Diana is very imperfect in flavor and deficient in size,\r\ntrue of many grapes but particularly so of this one. The best qualities\r\nof Diana are not brought out until the vines are seven or eight years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no grape better illustrates the importance of local influences\r\nand of knowledge of the peculiarities of varieties than Diana. All\r\ngrapes have their likes and dislikes but this one is capricious beyond\r\nmost others. It wants, for instance, comparatively poor, dry, gravelly\r\nsoil without any considerable amount of humus or nitrogen. On clays,\r\nloams, or rich soils, the vines make a rank growth and the fruits are\r\nfew, late and of poor quality. So, too, it needs to be long pruned, and\r\nto have all surplus bunches removed leaving a comparatively small crop\r\nto mature, and these should hang until frost. To the fact that Diana is\r\nso easily influenced must be attributed the great diversity of opinion\r\nas to its worth, some holding it to be a most excellent variety while in\r\na nearby vineyard it is considered worthless.\r\n\r\nIn favorable situations Diana may be expected to make a most\r\nsatisfactory grape for the amateur and where it does especially well it\r\nwill prove a profitable variety for the local market. Its splendid\r\nkeeping qualities make it a very desirable grape for late winter. It is\r\neven better in this respect than Catawba, one of the best keepers. While\r\nthe pulp of Diana has the meaty structure which adapts it for long\r\nkeeping its pulpiness is not objectionable as in some grapes and its\r\nthick skin has a rich, spicy flavor. Wine made from Diana is said to be\r\nsecond to none from our native grapes, equalling or surpassing that made\r\nfrom Catawba.\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Diana Crehore of Milton, Massachusetts, is due the honor of\r\nhaving originated Diana. The variety was produced from seed of the\r\nCatawba open to cross-pollination, planted about 1834. It was exhibited\r\nbefore the Massachusetts Horticultural Society in 1843. The Pomological\r\nCongress at their second meeting in 1850 placed Diana on their list as a\r\n\"new variety which promises well,\" and in 1854 it was included in the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society list of sorts recommended for general\r\ncultivation. The demand for this grape was so keen that in 1850 it was\r\nsold for $15 a vine.\r\n\r\nThe species of Diana is usually given as Labrusca but the Vinifera-like\r\nberries and the intermittent tendrils indicate Vinifera and the bloom on\r\nthe shoots suggests a strain of either Bicolor or Aestivalis.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, not always hardy, produces light to medium crops,\r\n     somewhat susceptible to attacks of leaf-hoppers and fungi. Canes\r\n     pubescent, long, of average number, thick to medium, light brown to\r\n     reddish-brown, covered with thin blue bloom; nodes enlarged,\r\n     slightly flattened; internodes medium to long; diaphragm thick;\r\n     pith medium to large; shoots pubescent; tendrils intermittent,\r\n     long, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds large, of average length, thickish, obtuse to conical,\r\n     open in mid-season. Young leaves colored on lower side and along\r\n     margin of upper side with faint carmine, the smaller leaves usually\r\n     heavily coated with thick silvery down. Leaves medium to large,\r\n     inclined to thick; upper surface variable in color ranging from\r\n     light to dark green, usually rather dull, nearly smooth to slightly\r\n     rugose; lower surface pale green, heavily pubescent; lobes vary\r\n     from three to five, terminal lobe acute; petiolar sinus moderately\r\n     deep, wide to medium, often closed and overlapping; basal sinus\r\n     shallow, not wide; lateral sinus not deep, medium to narrow; teeth\r\n     shallow, intermediate in width. Flowers fertile, open in\r\n     mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens earlier than Catawba, keeps unusually well. Clusters\r\n     medium to large, intermediate in length, rather broad, tapering to\r\n     slightly cylindrical, occasionally shouldered, the shoulder being\r\n     attached to the cluster by a rather long stem, compact to medium;\r\n     peduncle short to medium, slender; pedicel above average length,\r\n     covered with small scattering warts; brush of fair length, rather\r\n     slender, pale green. Berries somewhat irregular in size, above\r\n     medium to small, roundish to slightly ovate in compact clusters,\r\n     rather light red covered with thin lilac bloom, persistent, firm.\r\n     Skin very thick, tough, adheres slightly to the pulp, contains no\r\n     pigment, with but little astringency. Flesh pale green,\r\n     translucent, juicy, tough, fine-grained, vinous, with a little\r\n     foxiness, sweet at skin to agreeably tart at center, good in\r\n     quality. Seeds do not separate readily from the pulp unless fruit\r\n     is fully ripe, one to three, average two, intermediate in size,\r\n     breadth and length, light brown; raphe buried in a rather wide,\r\n     shallow groove; chalaza large, above center, circular, distinct.\r\n     Must 88°-90°.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIANA HAMBURG.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca, Aestivalis?)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _N.

It is worth\r\ndiscussion here only because it is an illustration of what can be done\r\nin grape-breeding and because it was one of the parents of several\r\nbetter known sorts chief of which is Brighton. The fruit of Diana\r\nHamburg is that of the European parent, while the vine is more nearly\r\nthat of Diana in appearance but quite that of Black Hamburg in\r\nconstitution, being very susceptible to disease, somewhat tender,\r\nunproductive in our climate and ripening its fruit late.\r\n\r\nDiana Hamburg was the first of Jacob Moore's productions, having been\r\nraised from seed of Diana fertilized by pollen of Black Hamburg about\r\n1860. It was first exhibited at the New York Agricultural Society\r\nmeeting in September, 1864. For a few years it attracted some attention\r\nbut soon passed from cultivation. The following description is compiled\r\nfrom various sources:\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous when not diseased; canes short-jointed. Leaves of\r\n     medium size, somewhat concave. Fruit-clusters large, compact,\r\n     shouldered. Berries above medium, slightly oval, dark red, tender,\r\n     free from pulp. Except in color, which shows a more reddish tinge,\r\n     it very closely resembles Black Hamburg. The vine is tender and\r\n     very susceptible to mildew.\r\n\r\n\r\nDON JUAN.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Horticulturist_, =29=:329. 1874. =2.= _Am. Pom. Soc.

It has been\r\ntested by grape collectors for forty years and is now passing from even\r\nthe collections. Its chief fault in this State is that it ripens too\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nDon Juan was originated by J. H. Ricketts of Newburgh, New York, over\r\nthirty years ago from seed of Iona pollinated by General Marmora. The\r\noriginator claimed that Don Juan was a better grape than its parent,\r\nIona, but it has fallen far short of this in the vineyards of the State.\r\nThe connection of the name with the grape is not apparent.\r\n\r\n     Vine intermediate in vigor, appears hardy and productive. Canes\r\n     short, rather brittle, slightly roughened; tendrils intermittent,\r\n     bifid. Leaves medium to thin, not very large, light green. Fruit\r\n     ripens rather late, keeps well. Clusters medium to large, rather\r\n     broad, shouldered, strongly tapering, very loose. Berries large to\r\n     medium, distinctly oval, dark red, covered with dark lilac or\r\n     slightly blue bloom, strongly persistent, somewhat soft. Flesh\r\n     tender and nearly melting, vinous, resembles Black Hamburg somewhat\r\n     in flavor, good in quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOWNING.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Aestivalis, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Am.

RICKETTS' NO. 1 (2).\r\n     _Ricketts' No. 1_ (10).\r\n\r\nLittle known in cultivation, although it has been grown since 1870 and\r\nhas had the recommendations of our most expert horticulturists, Downing\r\nis well worthy a place in the garden of grape-growers at least.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOWNING]\r\n\r\nIts high quality, handsome appearance, and excellence as a keeper, make\r\nit desirable in all regions where the climate is sufficiently temperate\r\nto allow it to withstand the winter and to develop in full its admirable\r\nfruit characters. Added to the above qualities are fair vigor and health\r\nof vine, while with its defects must be mentioned late ripening and\r\nsusceptibility to mildew in unfavorable seasons. When grown in most\r\nparts of New York the vine of Downing should be laid down in the winter\r\nor receive other protection. In most seasons, too, unremitting warfare\r\nmust be kept up with bordeaux mixture to check mildew. In appearance of\r\nbunch and berry Downing is one of the most distinct of our varieties,\r\nthe clusters being large and well formed and the berries having the long\r\noval shape of a Malaga with a delicate light bloom. The flesh, too,\r\nshows _Vitis vinifera_ in texture as well as quality while neither seeds\r\nnor skins are as objectionable as in the best of our pure-bred American\r\nvarieties. Few amateurs realize the richness of our cultivated\r\ngrape-flora or the garden would be supplied by other varieties than\r\nConcord, Niagara and Delaware and of these Downing would be one.\r\n\r\nJ. H. Ricketts of Newburgh, New York, originated Downing some time about\r\n1865. It is one of the first of Ricketts' hybrids and was first known as\r\n_Ricketts' No. 1._ The parentage is variously given as Isabella\r\nfertilized by Muscat Hamburg, Croton fertilized by Black Hamburg, and\r\nIsraella fertilized by Muscat Hamburg.[183] The last combination is that\r\ngiven by J. G. Burrows of Fishkill, New York, who was connected with J.\r\nH. Ricketts in his work and who introduced Downing in 1883; hence it is\r\nprobably correct. Ricketts thought highly of this variety and gave it\r\nthe name of America's great pomologist, Charles Downing.\r\n\r\n     Vine variable in vigor, usually winter-kills somewhat, not very\r\n     productive, especially where it winter-kills. Canes short, few,\r\n     rather slender, nearly dark green to slightly ash-gray tinge,\r\n     surface covered with thin blue bloom, often roughened with few\r\n     small warts; nodes much enlarged, strongly flattened; internodes\r\n     medium to short; diaphragm rather thick; pith large to medium;\r\n     shoots glabrous; tendrils intermittent, of average length, bifid to\r\n     trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds intermediate in size and thickness, short, obtuse to\r\n     nearly conical, open very late. Leaves medium to small, roundish,\r\n     thick; upper surface dark green, slightly glossy, rugose; lower\r\n     surface rather deep green with almost no pubescence; veins somewhat\r\n     distinct; lobes none to five, terminal lobe acute; petiolar sinus\r\n     of medium depth, very narrow, closed and overlapping; basal sinus\r\n     usually lacking but shallow and narrow when present; lateral sinus\r\n     shallow to medium, narrow; teeth above average in width and depth.\r\n     Flowers open late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens a little later than Concord, often keeps until spring.\r\n     Clusters large, long, rather slender, cylindrical to slightly\r\n     tapering, uniform, sometimes loosely shouldered, variable in\r\n     compactness; peduncle short to medium, inclined to thick; pedicel\r\n     intermediate in length, slender, covered with numerous warts; brush\r\n     long, slender, greenish. Berries large to medium, distinctly oval,\r\n     dark purplish-black, glossy, covered with light blue bloom,\r\n     strongly persistent, almost firm. Skin very thick, tender, adheres\r\n     considerably to the pulp, contains almost no pigment, without\r\n     astringency. Flesh greenish or with slight yellow tinge,\r\n     translucent, very juicy, tender, fine-grained, vinous, mild, very\r\n     good in quality. The few seeds separate easily from the pulp, one\r\n     to three, average two, intermediate in size and breadth, strongly\r\n     notched, rather long, brownish; raphe obscure; chalaza of mean\r\n     size, surface frequently roughened, above center, circular to oval,\r\n     variable in distinctness.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRACUT AMBER.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _U.

The fruit has no particular merit, its thick skin, coarse\r\npulp, seeds and rank foxy taste all being objectionable. But the vine is\r\nvery hardy and productive, and the fruit ripens early making it valuable\r\nin the northern limits of viticulture and in other locations where a\r\nvigorous, hardy early grape is wanted. It is of no value for the market\r\nor for wine-making and therefore of use only for the home in the far\r\nNorth, though the fact that it does not keep well is still further\r\nagainst it for this purpose. The variety is of interest to the breeder\r\nwho desires a red Labrusca of the northern type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRACUT AMBER]\r\n\r\nAsa Clement of Dracut, Massachusetts, originated Dracut Amber from\r\nseed of a native reddish Labrusca that grew near a Catawba vine. The\r\nseed was planted about 1855 and Mr. Clement called the resulting vine\r\nthe Amber grape. Later the new variety was introduced by Jacob W.\r\nManning under the name Dracut Amber. Catawba is supposed by Clement to\r\nhave been the male parent, but this is wholly conjectural and doubtful\r\nas the botanical and horticultural characters are those of a northern\r\nLabrusca. It was placed on the grape list of the American Pomological\r\nSociety fruit catalog in 1883 and was dropped, probably inadvertently,\r\nin 1897, as it was replaced in 1899 and has since remained.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, productive, somewhat susceptible to attacks\r\n     of leaf-hoppers. Canes long, rather numerous, medium to below in\r\n     size, darkish-brown; nodes slightly enlarged, usually flattened;\r\n     internodes medium to below in length; diaphragm of average\r\n     thickness; pith above medium size; shoots pubescent; tendrils\r\n     continuous, long, bifid to sometimes trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds decidedly variable in size, length, and thickness,\r\n     prominent, obtuse to conical. Young leaves tinged on lower side\r\n     with bright carmine and very strongly colored along margin of upper\r\n     side with carmine. Leaves large to medium, rather thick; upper\r\n     surface dark green, dull, smoothish; lower surface pale green or\r\n     grayish, faintly cobwebby; veins indistinct; lobes three or\r\n     sometimes five in number with terminal lobe obtuse to acute;\r\n     petiolar sinus moderately deep, rather narrow to medium; basal\r\n     sinus shallow to narrow; lateral sinus usually shallow, medium to\r\n     rather wide; teeth shallow, of average width. Flowers sometimes on\r\n     plan of six, slightly sterile to fertile, open in mid-season;\r\n     stamens variable in length.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens earlier than Concord, does not keep well, as the\r\n     berries soon shrivel. Clusters not especially satisfactory in\r\n     general appearance, variable in size, short to medium, rather\r\n     broad, somewhat cylindrical, irregular, rarely shouldered, compact\r\n     to medium; peduncle short, slender; pedicel nearly short, of\r\n     average thickness, covered with numerous warts, enlarged at point\r\n     of attachment to berry; brush rather long, light yellowish-green.\r\n     Berries medium to large, variable in shape ranging from oval to\r\n     roundish, dull pale red or dark amber, covered with thin lilac or\r\n     faint blue bloom, often inclined to drop when overripe, soft. Skin\r\n     unusually thick, somewhat tender, adheres slightly to pulp,\r\n     contains no pigment, slightly astringent. Flesh greenish,\r\n     translucent, juicy, rather fine-grained and tough, very foxy,\r\n     moderately sweet to decidedly acid at center, inferior in quality.\r\n     Seeds adherent, two to five in number averaging three, large to\r\n     below medium, broad to medium, light brown; raphe shows only as a\r\n     groove; chalaza intermediate in size, oval, above center, rather\r\n     distinct and in a depression.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTCHESS.[184]\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca, Bourquiniana?

It has never been largely grown in commercial vineyards\r\nbecause the vine is tender to cold and capricious as to soil and other\r\nconditions. Moreover the berries do not ripen quite evenly and berries\r\nand foliage are very susceptible to fungi. In soils to which it is not\r\nadapted berries and bunches are small and the latter are loose and\r\nstraggling. But in spite of its defects Dutchess should not be discarded\r\nby the grape-lover for there are few grapes better for the table and\r\nthat will take its place as a pure-flavored, refreshing, juicy grape. It\r\nis sweet and rich and yet does not cloy the appetite; the flesh is\r\ntranslucent, sparkling, fine-grained and tender; the seeds are small,\r\nfew and part readily from the pulp; the skin is thin yet tough enough\r\nfor good keeping but not so much so as to be objectionable in eating.\r\nThe bunches are large and compact when well grown and the berries,\r\nthough but medium sized, are attractive because of their translucency,\r\nthe touch of amber when fully ripe, and the distinctive dots so well\r\nshown in the color-plate. Dutchess does not want an extremely rich soil\r\nnor close pruning and the bunches should be thinned and as soon as ripe\r\nought to be picked as there is a tendency to crack when overripe or\r\nexposed to the wet. Dutchess is self-fertile and therefore desirable\r\nwhere only a few vines are wanted, obviating the trouble of mixed\r\nplanting for cross-pollination. The clusters are especially fine when\r\nbagged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUTCHESS]\r\n\r\nDutchess is another variety from A. J. Caywood[185] of Marlboro, New\r\nYork, from seed of a white Concord seedling pollinated by mixed pollen\r\nof Delaware and Walter planted in 1868. The white fruited maternal vine\r\nwas an offspring of Concord pollinated by Montgomery. Dutchess was\r\nintroduced by its originator about 1880. The variety was placed on the\r\ngrape list of the American Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1881\r\nwhere it has since been retained.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to weak, depending upon amount of winter injury,\r\n     often not hardy, an uncertain bearer, susceptible to mildew in some\r\n     localities. Canes intermediate in length and number, medium to\r\n     below in size, moderately dark brown, covered with a slight amount\r\n     of bloom, surface usually somewhat roughened; nodes slightly\r\n     enlarged and flattened; internodes short to very short; diaphragm\r\n     unusually thick; pith below average size; shoots slightly\r\n     pubescent; tendrils intermittent, short, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds large to medium, short, thick to medium, conical to\r\n     obtuse. Young leaves faintly tinged on lower side and along margin\r\n     of upper side with light rose-carmine. Leaves above medium to\r\n     below, irregular in outline, of average thickness; upper surface\r\n     light green, slightly glossy, moderately smooth; lower surface pale\r\n     green, pubescent; veins not distinct; leaf usually not lobed, with\r\n     terminus slightly acute; petiolar sinus of average depth, medium to\r\n     narrow; basal sinus shallow when present; lateral sinus varies from\r\n     medium in depth to a mere notch; teeth intermediate in depth and\r\n     width. Flowers fertile or nearly so, open somewhat late; stamens\r\n     upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens in mid-season, keeps and ships well. Clusters large to\r\n     medium, long, rather slender, below average width, not very\r\n     uniform, slightly tapering to cylindrical, with prominent single\r\n     shoulder, medium to compact; peduncle short to medium, not very\r\n     thick; pedicel inferior in length, quite slender, nearly smooth,\r\n     enlarged at point of attachment to fruit; brush amber-colored.\r\n     Berries of medium size, roundish to oval, pale yellowish-green\r\n     verging on amber, some berries showing a decided bronze tinge,\r\n     covered with thin gray bloom, persistent, firm. Skin sprinkled with\r\n     small dark dots, rather thin, tough, adheres to the pulp, contains\r\n     no pigment, without astringency. Flesh very pale green,\r\n     translucent, juicy, fine-grained, tender, vinous, sweet, of\r\n     pleasant flavor, quality high; on heavy clay soils the quality is\r\n     not fully developed. The seeds, which are tender and easily\r\n     crushed, separate readily from the pulp, one to two or occasionally\r\n     three, rather small, wide, short to medium, plump, moderately\r\n     sharp-pointed, brownish; raphe obscure; chalaza of average size,\r\n     roundish, above center, distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY DAISY.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Pa.

Its\r\nearliness ought to commend it somewhat as the ripening period is eight\r\nor ten days earlier than Champion or Moore Early, making it one of the\r\nvery earliest varieties. For a grape maturing at its season it both\r\nkeeps and ships well. It would seem to be as desirable, or more so, than\r\nHartford or Champion.\r\n\r\nEarly Daisy was originated by Mr. John Kready of Mount Joy,\r\nPennsylvania, in 1874, as a chance seedling in his garden. It is\r\nsupposed by many, from its general characters, to be a seedling of\r\nHartford.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, produces fair crops. Tendrils continuous,\r\n     bifid. Leaves medium to small, light green; lower surface slightly\r\n     pubescent, cobwebby. Flowers nearly sterile. Fruit ripens as early\r\n     or earlier than Hartford and is a good shipper and keeper for an\r\n     early grape. Clusters small to medium, often blunt at ends,\r\n     slightly cylindrical, sometimes single-shouldered, compact. Berries\r\n     of medium size, roundish, rather dull black, covered with abundant\r\n     blue bloom, persistent. Skin tough, contains a large amount of\r\n     purplish-red pigment. Flesh tough, solid, slightly aromatic, rather\r\n     tart at skin to acid at center, inferior in flavor and quality.\r\n     Seeds numerous, of average size. Not good enough for dessert\r\n     purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY OHIO]\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY DAWN.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera, Aestivalis.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Am. Pom. Soc.

Although it originated in New York\r\nit was never widely grown in this State. It is now, so far as records\r\nshow, nearly obsolete.\r\n\r\nDr. Wm. A. M.

The fruit resembles that of Concord, of which it is\r\nprobably a seedling. The claims made for this variety that it is hardy,\r\nvigorous and productive, have not been borne out on the Station grounds;\r\nbut on the contrary the vine is somewhat tender, is not a strong grower,\r\nand does not bear large crops. The quality is very poor. Now that the\r\nSouth is sending many grapes of high quality to northern markets at the\r\ntime Early Ohio and other grapes of its season are ripening it is\r\ndoubtful if a grape having only earliness to commend it should have a\r\nplace in our viticulture. Notwithstanding its defects Early Ohio is\r\ngrown somewhat commonly in New York though its culture is on the wane.\r\n\r\nThe original seedling of Early Ohio was found in the year 1882 in the\r\nvineyard of R. A. Hunt, at Euclid, Ohio, between rows of Delaware and\r\nConcord. It was introduced in 1892 by the C. S. Curtice Company, of\r\nPortland, New York.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to weak, often tender, usually produces medium crops.\r\n     Canes short to very short, few in number, rather slender, brownish\r\n     with a slight reddish tinge; nodes somewhat enlarged, flattened;\r\n     internodes short; diaphragm thick; pith intermediate in size;\r\n     shoots pubescent; tendrils continuous, usually short, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds rather small and short, inclined to slender, pointed to\r\n     conical, open in mid-season. Young leaves lightly tinged on under\r\n     side and along margin of upper side with rose-carmine. Leaves\r\n     intermediate in size, of average thickness; upper surface light\r\n     green, dull, smoothish; lower surface varies from pale green to\r\n     slight bronze, pubescent; veins fairly distinct; lobes vary from\r\n     none to three, with terminal lobe acute; petiolar sinus medium to\r\n     shallow, rather wide; basal sinus usually absent; lateral sinus\r\n     nearly shallow, wide to rather narrow; teeth shallow to sometimes\r\n     medium, somewhat narrow. Flowers fertile, open in mid-season;\r\n     stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens two or three weeks earlier than Concord, some seasons\r\n     a few days earlier than Moore Early, does not keep well. Clusters\r\n     medium in size, intermediate to long, below average in thickness,\r\n     tapering, frequently not shouldered, moderately compact; peduncle\r\n     short to medium, of fair thickness; pedicel intermediate in length,\r\n     medium to rather slender, covered with few, small warts; brush\r\n     above average length, slender, tinged with red. Berries not very\r\n     uniform in size, averaging medium, roundish, purplish-black,\r\n     slightly glossy, covered with rather heavy blue bloom, persistent,\r\n     firm. Skin intermediate in thickness and toughness, adheres\r\n     slightly to the pulp, contains a moderate amount of reddish\r\n     pigment, astringent. Flesh greenish, translucent, juicy, somewhat\r\n     tough, slightly aromatic, sweet at skin but slightly acid at\r\n     center, inferior in quality. Seeds do not separate easily unless\r\n     fully ripe, one to four, average three, intermediate in size,\r\n     length, and breadth, notched, light brown with yellowish-brown\r\n     tips; raphe obscure; chalaza of fair size, slightly above center,\r\n     circular to oval, rather obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY VICTOR.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Bourquiniana?)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Am.

When one tastes this variety at\r\nthe beginning of the grape season, he has no palate for Hartford,\r\nChampion, Ives, Janesville, or even Moore Early, and he will be\r\nconscious of defects in the flavor of many of the later grapes which are\r\nsupposed to have high quality. Early Victor is especially pleasing to\r\nthose who want a pure-flavored grape and object to the foxiness of our\r\nnative varieties so marked in Hartford and Champion but almost wholly\r\nlacking in this variety. Were it but a few days earlier and bunch and\r\nberry a little larger and more attractive, Early Victor might be the\r\ngrape _par excellence_ for home and market to begin the grape season.\r\nThe vines are hardy, healthy, vigorous, and productive, with growth and\r\nfoliage greatly resembling Hartford, which is probably one of its\r\nparents, Delaware being the other. The bunches are small and compact and\r\nsomewhat variable in shape; the berries are about the size and shape of\r\nthose of Delaware. Its season is that of Moore Early and Hartford, or a\r\nlittle later, though, like many black grapes, it colors before it is\r\nripe and is often picked much too green. Unfortunately the fruit is\r\nsusceptible to black-rot and a little inclined to shrivel after\r\nripening. Although introduced into American viticulture in 1881, Early\r\nVictor is still little known and deserves far more general recognition\r\nboth by the amateur and the commercial grape-grower.\r\n\r\nJohn Burr,[186] of Leavenworth, Kansas, originated Early Victor about\r\n1871 and sent it out for testing in 1881. It was placed on the grape\r\nlist of the American Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1883 and is\r\nstill retained. Early Victor is said to be a seedling of Delaware\r\npollinated by Hartford. This, however, is mere surmise, as nothing is\r\nknown positively as to its parentage, and the statement was made\r\nfrequently by the Kansas Horticultural Society, of which Burr was a\r\nmember, that it was a seedling of Concord. It was introduced, probably\r\nabout 1887, by Stayman & Black of Leavenworth.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, healthy, hardy, productive. Canes long, numerous,\r\n     rather slender, dark brown to slightly reddish-brown, surface\r\n     pubescent; nodes enlarged, usually not flattened; internodes long\r\n     to medium; diaphragm nearly thin; pith intermediate in size; shoots\r\n     pubescent; tendrils continuous, of average length, bifid to\r\n     sometimes trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds of average size, short to medium, rather thick, often\r\n     strongly compressed, nearly obtuse to conical, open in mid-season.\r\n     Young leaves tinged lightly on upper and lower sides with\r\n     rose-carmine. Leaves medium to above in size, rather thick; upper\r\n     surface dark green, moderately smooth; lower surface nearly\r\n     whitish, heavily pubescent; veins well defined; lobes three to five\r\n     in number, terminal lobe acute; petiolar sinus intermediate in\r\n     depth and width; basal sinus shallow and moderately wide when\r\n     present; lateral sinus medium to above in depth, narrow to medium\r\n     in width; teeth of average depth and width. Flowers nearly fertile\r\n     to somewhat sterile, open in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens with Moore Early or a little later, does not keep\r\n     well. Clusters medium to small, below average length, variable in\r\n     shape, cylindrical to tapering, frequently single-shouldered,\r\n     compact; peduncle intermediate in length and thickness; pedicel\r\n     medium to short, covered with numerous small warts; brush\r\n     wine-colored or pinkish-red. Berries small to medium, roundish to\r\n     slightly oblate, dark purplish-black, rather dull, covered with\r\n     heavy blue bloom, persistent, not very firm. Skin rather thin,\r\n     medium to tough, adheres but slightly to the pulp, contains much\r\n     red pigment, astringent. Flesh greenish-white, nearly opaque,\r\n     fine-grained, of medium toughness, aromatic, slightly vinous, not\r\n     foxy, sweet at skin but slightly acid at center, good in quality.\r\n     Seeds do not separate easily from the pulp unless the fruit is\r\n     thoroughly ripe, one to four, average three, of medium size, broad,\r\n     notched, below mean length, usually somewhat blunt, dark brown;\r\n     raphe obscure; chalaza of fair size, slightly above center,\r\n     circular, somewhat obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nEATON.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mass.

In appearance of bunch it is\r\none of the handsomest of our native grapes but as a table grape it ranks\r\nlow. Its flesh is tough and stringy and, though sweet at the skin, is\r\nacid at the seeds. It has the same foxiness that characterizes Concord\r\nbut with more juice and less richness than its parent so that it is well\r\ndescribed as a \"diluted Concord\". The skin is very similar to that of\r\nConcord, neither thicker nor thinner, and the fruit packs, ships and\r\nkeeps about the same, though if any thing less well because of the\r\ngreater amount of juice. The season is a few days earlier than Concord.\r\nThe vine is healthy, vigorous, hardy and productive and very similar in\r\nall botanical characters to its parent. The grapes ripen unevenly, the\r\nflowers are self-sterile and in some locations it is a shy bearer. Eaton\r\nhas been grown for nearly forty years and has not found favor with\r\neither the grower or the consumer and is being less and less grown,\r\nremaining in our viticulture only as a handsome exhibition grape and an\r\ninteresting seedling of Concord.\r\n\r\nThis mammoth Concord, the Eaton, originated with Calvin Eaton of\r\nConcord, New Hampshire, about 1868 from seed of Concord. Mr. Eaton\r\nstates that this was the best vine out of a lot of two thousand\r\nseedlings. The new variety was purchased by John B. Moore & Son of\r\nConcord, Massachusetts, in 1882, and was introduced by them in 1885.\r\nOwing to Mr. Moore's death it soon passed into the hands of the T. S.\r\nHubbard Company, of Fredonia, New York. It at once attracted much\r\nattention on account of its fine appearance and for a time was very\r\npopular, its popularity declining chiefly because of the poor quality of\r\nthe fruit.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, healthy, hardy, usually productive. Canes\r\n     intermediate in length and number, thick to medium, light brown\r\n     changing to darker brown at the nodes, covered with a small amount\r\n     of blue bloom; nodes enlarged, slightly flattened; internodes short\r\n     to medium; diaphragm of average thickness; pith large to medium;\r\n     shoots pubescent; tendrils continuous, rather long, bifid to\r\n     trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds medium to below in size, short, of nearly mean thickness,\r\n     conical to pointed, open in mid-season. Young leaves lightly tinged\r\n     on under side and along margin of upper side with carmine. Leaves\r\n     healthy, large, often roundish, thick; upper surface dark green, of\r\n     average smoothness; lower surface tinged with bronze, heavily\r\n     pubescent; veins distinct; lobes three when present, with terminal\r\n     lobe acute; petiolar sinus medium to shallow, rather wide; basal\r\n     sinus usually lacking; lateral sinus shallow, narrow, often\r\n     notched; teeth shallow to medium, not very wide. Flowers partly\r\n     fertile to somewhat sterile, open early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens slightly before Concord, keeps and ships only fairly\r\n     well. Clusters large to medium, short to above medium, often very\r\n     broad, blunt, slightly tapering, usually single-shouldered but\r\n     sometimes double-shouldered, compact to medium; peduncle short to\r\n     medium, thick; pedicel medium to rather long, thick, nearly smooth,\r\n     wide at point of attachment to berry; brush slender, pale green.\r\n     Berries rather uniform in size, averaging large, roundish, black,\r\n     not glossy, covered with heavy blue bloom, persistent, firm. Skin\r\n     intermediate in thickness, rather tough, adheres considerably to\r\n     the pulp, contains much purplish-red pigment, slightly astringent.\r\n     Flesh greenish, translucent, juicy, rather tough, slightly stringy\r\n     and foxy, nearly sweet at skin but quite acid at center, fair in\r\n     quality, ranking below Concord. Seeds rather adherent, one to four\r\n     in number, average two or three, above mean size, inclined to\r\n     broad, notched, intermediate in length, plump, somewhat blunt,\r\n     light brown; raphe buried in a rather wide, shallow groove; chalaza\r\n     nearly large, slightly above center, irregularly circular to oval,\r\n     obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\n(I) ECLIPSE.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Ill.

RIEHL'S NO. 10 (1, 2). _Riehl's No.\r\n     10_ (4).\r\n\r\nThere are two grapes bearing the name Eclipse, the origin and history of\r\nboth of which are briefly set forth below. Of the two, Riehl's Eclipse\r\nalone is deemed worthy of general discussion, the other, a green variety\r\nof this name, having passed out of cultivation if it were ever grown in\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ECLIPSE]\r\n\r\nThe grape under consideration, known for some years as _Riehl's No. 10_,\r\nis a comparatively new candidate for pomological honors, not having been\r\nnamed and introduced as Eclipse until 1906. It has not been grown\r\nlargely in New York and the East and we can therefore say but little of\r\nit other than to describe it as it grows on the Station grounds and to\r\nstate that in the West, Illinois in particular, it is most highly\r\nrecommended. At Geneva the Eclipse is very like the Concord, one of its\r\ngrandparents, it being a seedling of Niagara, differing chiefly in being\r\nearlier and of better quality. Bunches and berries are a little smaller\r\nthan Concord. The vines are hardy, healthy and productive, promising\r\nwell for commercial plantations. In Illinois it is said to hang on the\r\nvines long after it is ripe without deterioration and not to crack in\r\nwet weather. The color-plate and the description given below show the\r\nEclipse as it grows at this Station and if the grape-grower wishes a\r\nvariety answering to the general characters so depicted, the Eclipse is\r\ncertainly worthy a trial in New York.\r\n\r\nE. A. Riehl of Alton, Illinois, is the originator of Eclipse, the date\r\nof its origin being about 1890. He states that this is one of the\r\nseedlings from a lot of Niagara seed which was probably cross-pollinated\r\nby other varieties. The variety was introduced in 1906 by the Stark\r\nBrothers Nurseries and Orchards Company, Louisiana, Missouri.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes medium to above in length\r\n     and number, intermediate in size, rather dark reddish-brown; nodes\r\n     slightly enlarged; internodes of average length; diaphragm thick;\r\n     pith large to medium; shoots pubescent; tendrils continuous,\r\n     somewhat long, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds medium to nearly small, short, inclined to slender,\r\n     pointed to conical, open in mid-season. Young leaves colored on\r\n     lower side only, prevailing color pale green with slight\r\n     rose-carmine tinge. Leaves medium to large, of average thickness;\r\n     upper surface dark green, intermediate in smoothness; lower surface\r\n     whitish with slight bronze tinge, heavily pubescent, veins well\r\n     defined; lobes none to three with terminal lobe acute to acuminate;\r\n     petiolar sinus deep, medium to narrow; basal sinus usually lacking;\r\n     lateral sinus of average depth, rather narrow, often notched; teeth\r\n     medium to shallow, nearly narrow. Flowers sterile, open in\r\n     mid-season; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens slightly earlier than Concord, keeps fairly well.\r\n     Clusters intermediate in size, below average length, medium to\r\n     rather broad, tapering to cylindrical, frequently\r\n     single-shouldered, moderately compact; peduncle nearly short, thick\r\n     to medium; pedicel short, somewhat thick, covered with numerous\r\n     small warts; brush long, pale green. Berries large to medium,\r\n     slightly oval, rather dull black, covered with abundant blue bloom,\r\n     persistent, firm. Skin intermediate in thickness, tender, adheres\r\n     but slightly to the pulp, contains a small amount of wine-colored\r\n     pigment, somewhat astringent. Flesh pale green, translucent, juicy,\r\n     tender, rather fine-grained, foxy, sweet next the skin to agreeably\r\n     tart at center, resembles Concord very closely in flavor, good in\r\n     quality. Seeds separate very easily from the pulp, one to four,\r\n     average two or three, of mean size, somewhat short, broad to\r\n     medium, distinctly notched, rather blunt, brownish; raphe buried in\r\n     a deep groove; chalaza of average size, slightly above center to\r\n     nearly central, circular to nearly pear-shaped, distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n(II) ECLIPSE.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mo.

It attracted some attention in the Middle West,\r\nwhere the fruit was exhibited at various meetings but failed to attain\r\nfavor in the vineyard. It is now practically obsolete.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, injured in severe winters, variable in\r\n     productiveness, somewhat susceptible to mildew. Canes long to\r\n     medium, of average number, thick; internodes long; tendrils\r\n     continuous to intermittent, bifid to sometimes trifid. Leaves not\r\n     healthy, large to medium, of average greenness; lower surface\r\n     grayish-white. Flowers partly sterile; stamens upright. Fruit\r\n     ripens a little later than Diamond, keeps well. Clusters medium to\r\n     small, of average length, frequently single-shouldered, medium to\r\n     broad, compact to medium. Berries large to medium, roundish to\r\n     oblate, light green often with tinge of yellow, covered with thin\r\n     gray bloom, persistent. Skin thin, of average toughness, covered\r\n     with scattering, small, reddish-brown dots. Flesh tender, vinous,\r\n     sprightly, less sweet than Niagara, good to very good in quality.\r\n     Seeds separate easily from the pulp, one to four, average three,\r\n     above medium in size, intermediate in length and width; raphe\r\n     obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nELDORADO.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Am.

It is delicately\r\nflavored, with a very distinct aroma and taste; the flesh is tender,\r\nmelting and sweet from skin to seeds, all qualities rarely found in an\r\nearly grape. The season is about that of Moore Early, a time when there\r\nare few other really good white grapes. Eldorado is a full sister of\r\nLady Washington and is if anything better flavored than that most\r\nexcellent variety. These two grapes are secondary hybrids of Labrusca\r\nand Vinifera, Concord being the native parent. The vines inherit most of\r\nthe good qualities of Concord but Eldorado does not inherit Concord's\r\nability to set fruit well; even with cross-pollination it sometimes\r\nfails to bear and is not worth growing unless planted in a mixed\r\nvineyard. The clusters are so often small and straggling under the best\r\npossible conditions that the variety cannot be highly recommended to the\r\namateur yet its delightful flavor and its earliness may commend it to\r\nsome.\r\n\r\nJ. H. Ricketts of Newburgh, New York, produced Eldorado some time about\r\n1870 from seed of Concord fertilized by Allen's Hybrid. It was\r\nintroduced by the originator about 1881 and is still offered for sale by\r\na few nurserymen. Eldorado has been somewhat commonly grown in gardens\r\nand collections in the East but does not succeed in the West.\r\n\r\n     Vine usually a strong grower, hardy except in severe winters, an\r\n     uncertain bearer. Canes long, not very numerous; tendrils\r\n     intermittent to rarely continuous, bifid to trifid. Leaves below\r\n     medium to large, irregularly roundish, dark green, rugose on older\r\n     leaves; lower surface tinged with bronze, pubescent. Flowers\r\n     sterile, open medium late; stamens reflexed. Fruit ripens earlier\r\n     than Concord, keeps well. Clusters do not always set perfectly and\r\n     are quite variable in size, frequently single-shouldered, not\r\n     uniform in compactness. Berries large to medium, roundish,\r\n     yellowish-green changing to a golden yellow, covered with thin gray\r\n     bloom. Flesh tender, slightly foxy, sweet from skin to center,\r\n     mild, high flavored, good to very good in quality. Seeds\r\n     intermediate in size and length, blunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nELSINBURGH.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Aestivalis.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Amer.

It is certainly not\r\nknown in New York now and it is doubtful if it was ever much grown as it\r\nfruits very sparingly in the North and is but half hardy in the latitude\r\nof this State. In quality it is one of the best of the Aestivalis\r\ngrapes, having a pure, rich, vinous, spicy flavor without a trace of\r\nfoxiness. It would undoubtedly add variety to any amateur's vineyard\r\nand might prove of value in grape-breeding, otherwise it is not worth\r\ngrowing; it undoubtedly makes a very good red wine.\r\n\r\nThe origin of Elsinburgh is very uncertain. It was named after the\r\ntownship, Elsinborough, Salem County, New Jersey. In this neighborhood\r\nit was much raised at an early day. From here it was sent to various\r\nparts of the country. Whether it originated in this section or whether\r\nit was introduced at a still earlier date from elsewhere is unknown. It\r\nwas brought into notice by a Dr. Hulings. Although Elsinburgh has long\r\nsince ceased to be of importance, it is still offered for sale by an\r\noccasional nurseryman. It was placed on the grape list in the American\r\nPomological Society fruit catalog in 1862 and removed in 1891.\r\nElsinburgh is of especial interest as being the probable parent of\r\nDelaware. The variety shows Bourquiniana or Aestivalis in flavor and\r\ntexture of fruit, in texture and pubescence of leaf, and the bloom on\r\nyoung canes; its tenderness and susceptibility to mildew suggest\r\nVinifera.\r\n\r\n     Vine weak to moderately vigorous, not very hardy, produces light\r\n     crops. Canes short to medium, slender, covered with thin blue\r\n     bloom; tendrils intermittent, bifid to trifid. Leaves small to\r\n     medium, variable in color; lower surface hairy and slightly\r\n     pubescent. Flowers nearly fertile, open very late; stamens upright.\r\n     Fruit ripens early in October. Clusters medium to large, usually\r\n     single-shouldered, loose to medium. Berries small, roundish, black,\r\n     covered with blue bloom, contain but little pulp. Flesh vinous,\r\n     sweet, quality good. Seeds few, small.\r\n\r\n\r\nELVICAND.\r\n\r\n(Candicans, Riparia, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _An. Hort._, =1892=:176. =2.= _Bush.

It is interesting because of its parentage,\r\nhaving in it the blood of three species: Riparia, Labrusca and\r\nCandicans, and might prove valuable in breeding work, as starting a new\r\nand somewhat distinct group of grapes. There has been much complaint of\r\nthis variety being unproductive but Munson states that this is due to\r\nshort pruning and that it will bear heavily with very long pruning. It\r\nis too late in season for New York.\r\n\r\nThe variety was originated by T. V. Munson of Denison, Texas, from seed\r\nof Elvira accidentally fertilized by pollen of _Vitis candicans_. It was\r\nintroduced by the originator in 1893, and was placed on the grape list\r\nin the American Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1897, where it has\r\nsince been retained. It was dropped from the originator's catalog eight\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous and hardy. Shoots and under side of leaves showing\r\n     much white cottony pubescence. Leaves large to medium, shallowly\r\n     three-lobed. Flowers self-fertile.

The qualities which commended it were its great productiveness,\r\nin which character it is hardly surpassed in favorable locations by any\r\nother of our native grapes; its earliness, ripening in the North with\r\nConcord; its exceedingly good health, being almost free from cryptogamic\r\ndiseases and having almost no touch of black-rot in the average season\r\neven in the Southwest; its great vigor as shown by a strong stocky\r\ngrowth and ample foliage; and, lastly, almost perfect hardiness even as\r\nfar north as Canada. Its good qualities are offset by one or two defects\r\nwhich have caused it to lose in popularity as time has gone by until now\r\nit is not as widely grown as some of its seedlings. The most noticeable\r\nof its defects is its thin skin which bursts easily, thus wholly\r\ndebarring it from distant markets. Beside this, its flavor and\r\nappearance, as it grows here, are not sufficiently good to make it a\r\ntable grape and it can be used only for wine for which purpose it is\r\nmuch valued, though its habit of cracking in the bunch is sometimes much\r\nagainst it as a wine grape. The wine made from Elvira is light,\r\ncontaining comparatively little alcohol, and by those wine-makers who do\r\nnot dislike a slight foxiness in flavor, it is considered very good,\r\nimproving with age and being well adapted for blending with more highly\r\nflavored wines.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the reconstruction period in France, Elvira was used\r\nmore or less as a resistant stock and somewhat as a direct producer but\r\nwithin a few years it was condemned and abandoned for either purpose and\r\nis now known in France[187] only in varietal vineyards.\r\n\r\nElvira is a seedling of Taylor, a Riparia-Labrusca hybrid, and shows\r\nwell the peculiarities and general characters of the group of which\r\nTaylor is supposed to be the parent. Of the numerous hybrid Riparia\r\ngrapes, Elvira seems to have given the best coign of vantage for\r\nbreeding work and is the parent of a number of worthy pure-bred and\r\ncross-bred varieties. While it is to the species to which Elvira belongs\r\nthat we must look for our hardiest grapes, this variety and most of its\r\nprogeny are not suited to northern conditions, not because of tenderness\r\nto cold, but because they must have a long season for maturity and to\r\nattain their best quality. Riparia is largely used as a resistant stock\r\nin combating phylloxera, and Elvira and other similar hybrid offspring\r\nare almost proof against this pest.\r\n\r\nElvira was originated by Jacob Rommel of Morrison, Missouri, from seed\r\nof Taylor which some say was pollinated by Martha. It was planted in\r\n1863 and fruited for the first time in 1869. Bush & Son & Meissner\r\nintroduced the variety in 1874. It was placed on the grape list of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1881 where it is still\r\nretained. Its great popularity in Missouri was largely due to the energy\r\nwith which it was advertised by certain prominent viticulturists, they\r\nhaving been most favorably impressed with it because of its withstanding\r\nthe severe cold of the winter of 1873 without protection. Husmann, in\r\nparticular, spoke of Elvira in the highest terms and recommended its\r\ncultivation. Its popularity spread from Missouri to the islands and the\r\nOhio shore of Lake Erie but scarcely reached New York. In all of these\r\nregions its culture is now on the wane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELVIRA]\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, produces very heavy crops, more\r\n     productive than Concord.

The variety is equally vigorous in\r\ngrowth, just as free from predaceous parasites, whether fungi or\r\ninsects, and upon vines of the same age it is as productive but is a\r\nlittle less hardy and the grapes are not as attractive in appearance as\r\nthe other varieties named. In particular the clusters are small in some\r\nlocalities, a defect which can be overcome only by severe pruning or by\r\nthinning. The quality is very good, much better than Niagara, somewhat\r\nbetter than Pocklington and nearly as good as Diamond. It approaches the\r\nflavor of the Old World grapes, its slight wild taste suggesting one of\r\nthe Muscats rather than the foxiness of the Niagara. Empire State is\r\nesteemed for the table wherever known and is in demand for wine-making,\r\nthe wine from it being most excellent for champagne according to reports\r\nfrom the Keuka champagne-makers. Empire State ripens a little earlier\r\nthan Niagara, hangs long upon the vine and keeps well after picking and\r\nwithout losing flavor. The variety is quite distinct in its\r\nhorticultural as well as its botanical characters.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat remarkable white grape was originated by James H. Ricketts\r\nof Newburgh, New York. The variety was fruited for the first time in\r\n1879. The originator says that it came from seed of Hartford pollinated\r\nby Clinton but this parentage has been questioned by many viticulturists\r\nas it does not show characters of either of the reputed parents. A very\r\ngeneral supposition is that the variety is a hybrid between Clinton and\r\nsome variety of Vinifera, the characters of the fruit in particular\r\nindicating such breeding. Empire State was bought from the originator by\r\nGeorge A. Stone of Rochester for $4,000, a record price for an American\r\ngrape. It was introduced about 1884 and was placed on the grape list of\r\nthe American Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1889, where it still\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n     Vine a fair to good grower, usually healthy, in some locations\r\n     appears somewhat tender, moderately productive to productive.

Its\r\nfruit is almost identical with Barry, though the bunches do not equal\r\nthat variety in size, but the vine is not as desirable, being only\r\nhalf-hardy, not productive, with sterile flowers and not setting fruit\r\nwell even in mixed vineyards.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the origin and parentage of Essex see \"Rogers'\r\nHybrids.\" Essex, then known as _Rogers' No. 41_, is first mentioned\r\nseparately from the other hybrids about 1865. There appears to have been\r\nsome confusion in the numbers, as some of the early describers speak of\r\nthe grape as red, others black. The name Essex was given by Mr. Rogers\r\nin 1869, in honor of Essex County, Massachusetts. The same year it was\r\nplaced on the grape list of the American Pomological Society fruit\r\ncatalog, where it was retained until 1895, when it was dropped.

It\r\nhas several defects which make it less valuable than many other better\r\nknown white grapes and is therefore not recommended for New York. Its\r\ndefects appear in the description given below.\r\n\r\nThe variety was originated by E. W. Bull of Concord, Massachusetts, from\r\nseed of Concord. It was introduced by George S. Josselyn of Fredonia,\r\nNew York, in 1889.

ROMMEL'S ETTA (4, 12). _Rommel's No.\r\n     3_ (1).\r\n\r\nIn appearance, taste and texture of flesh Etta is very similar to Elvira\r\nof which it is a seedling. The small yellowish clusters which\r\ncharacterize Elvira are almost exactly reproduced in Etta differing\r\nchiefly in often having a shoulder quite as large as the main bunch\r\nitself, and in having, for most palates, a better flavor, lacking the\r\nslight foxiness of Elvira. The vine is very vigorous, hardy, and\r\nproductive to a fault. The fruit ripens late, at the time of Catawba,\r\nand too late to make the variety of value for New York. Etta is not a\r\ngood table grape and, as with its parent, makes only a fair grade of\r\nwhite wine but this can be produced in such quantity as to give the\r\nvariety value in producing a wine for blending with more highly flavored\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of Elvira to crack and overbear caused the originator of\r\nthat variety, Jacob Rommel of Morrison, Missouri, to try for a grape\r\nwithout these faults and the result was Etta from seed of Elvira. It was\r\nfirst exhibited in 1879 as _Elvira Seedling No. 3_ and was awarded the\r\npremium as a seedling wine grape at the Mississippi Valley Horticultural\r\nSociety meeting in St. Louis in 1880. It has never become popular in the\r\nEast, probably on account of its late ripening. In Missouri Etta is\r\ngenerally considered to be, all characters taken into account, a better\r\ngrape than Elvira, falling below it in but one particular, resistance to\r\nblack-rot.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to very vigorous, hardy except in severe winters,\r\n     productive. Canes long, rather numerous, about average size, nearly\r\n     light to medium dark brown; tendrils continuous, bifid. Leaves\r\n     healthy, above medium to large, thickish; upper surface dark green,\r\n     slightly glossy, nearly smooth; lower surface pale green, somewhat\r\n     cobwebby; veins rather distinct. Flowers fertile or nearly so, open\r\n     medium early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens late, two or three weeks after Concord, keeps fairly\r\n     well. Clusters medium to small, rather short and broad, irregularly\r\n     cylindrical, usually with a short, medium-sized single shoulder\r\n     but sometimes so heavily shouldered as to form a double bunch, very\r\n     compact.

It\r\nseems now, as one studies its characters, to show an association of as\r\ngreat a number of valuable good qualities and as few objectionable ones\r\nas almost any other of our black grapes, yet the variety is now but\r\nlittle grown. Briefly summarized, its good qualities are: Vines above\r\nthe average in vigor, hardiness and productiveness, remarkable for their\r\nshort-jointed wood; clusters and berries well-formed, of good size and\r\nthe latter a handsome black with fine bloom, making a very attractive\r\ncluster of grapes; flesh tender, seemingly dissolving into wine-like\r\njuice under slight pressure; the flavor is pure without a trace of\r\nfoxiness, rich, sweet, and vinous, making a very delicious and\r\nrefreshing fruit, though the large seeds are somewhat objectionable.\r\nEumelan makes a very good red wine. The season of ripening is such that\r\nthe variety may be called early, yet it keeps much better than most of\r\nthe other grapes maturing with it and becomes, therefore, a mid-season\r\nand late grape as well as an early one. It neither cracks nor shells\r\nbadly, and ships very well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EUMELAN]\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to name its defects. So far as we can discover,\r\nthese are susceptibility to mildew, sterile flowers, and difficulty in\r\npropagation. Unquestionably the latter character has greatly hindered\r\nits culture, as the vines can be had only at extra expense and\r\nnurserymen are loath to grow it at all. Eumelan can at least be\r\nrecommended to amateur growers and for the garden and it is well worth\r\nfurther trial by grape-growers.\r\n\r\nEumelan is a chance seedling which grew from seed about 1847 in the yard\r\nof a Mr. Thorne at Fishkill Landing, New York. About 1860 it fell into\r\nthe hands of Dr. C. W. Grant of Iona Island and was introduced by him in\r\n1867. By some it is supposed to be a seedling of Isabella. Bush gives\r\nthe species as Aestivalis. Munson states, however, that he can see\r\nnothing in it but Labrusca and Vinifera. Labrusca seems to be indicated\r\nvery plainly by the texture of the fruit and by the seeds, Vinifera\r\npossibly by a general appearance of the vine difficult to define and\r\nalso by the tendency to mildew. Besides this, however, there are the\r\nbluish bloom on shoots and canes, the pigment beneath the skin, the\r\nspicy taste in the berries, and the difficulty of propagation from\r\ncuttings, all of which are difficult to account for except by\r\nrecognizing the presence of Aestivalis or Bicolor blood.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to medium, hardy, medium to productive, inclined to\r\n     mildew. Canes intermediate in length, numerous, of average\r\n     thickness, covered with considerable blue bloom; nodes enlarged,\r\n     flattened; internodes short to medium; diaphragm thick; pith about\r\n     medium size; shoots glabrous; tendrils intermittent, rather long,\r\n     trifid to bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds large, long, rather thick, conspicuous, obtuse to\r\n     conical, open in mid-season. Young leaves heavily tinged on under\r\n     side and lightly tinged along margin of upper side with bright\r\n     carmine. Leaves medium to large, of average thickness; upper\r\n     surface rather dark green, glossy, smooth to medium; lower surface\r\n     pale green, not pubescent; veins distinct; lobes usually three in\r\n     number with terminal lobe acute to acuminate; petiolar sinus medium\r\n     to deep, variable in width; basal sinus usually lacking; lateral\r\n     sinus shallow to medium, rather narrow or often a mere notch; teeth\r\n     inclined to shallow, usually above medium in width. Flowers\r\n     sterile, open in mid-season; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens before mid-season, keeps frequently until late winter.\r\n     Clusters of average size, long to medium, rather slender, slightly\r\n     tapering to cylindrical, often with a long, loose, single shoulder,\r\n     variable in compactness; peduncle medium to long, of average size;\r\n     pedicel somewhat short, rather slender, covered with few small\r\n     warts, wide at point of attachment to fruit; brush short, stubby,\r\n     pale green. Berries medium in size, roundish to frequently\r\n     compressed, black, glossy, covered with abundant blue bloom,\r\n     persistent, firm. Skin intermediate in thickness, tough, rather\r\n     adherent to the pulp, contains a moderate amount of wine-colored\r\n     pigment, slightly astringent. Flesh somewhat dark green, juicy,\r\n     fine-grained, nearly tender, stringy, not foxy, rather spicy and\r\n     aromatic with Aestivalis flavor, sweet, ranks good or higher in\r\n     quality. Seeds adhere slightly to the pulp, one to four, average\r\n     three, above medium to large, rather wide, intermediate in length,\r\n     somewhat blunt, plump, brownish; raphe obscure; chalaza oval to\r\n     circular, slightly above center, rather distinct.

Eureka resembles the Isabella very closely\r\nin both fruit and vine. The fruit ripens about two weeks earlier, is\r\nsomewhat more tender in pulp, more compact in the bunch, and with the\r\nvine of greater vigor.\r\n\r\nEureka was originated by S. Folsom of Attica, Wyoming County, New York,\r\nsome time in the fifties, and was introduced a few years later by Bogue\r\n& Son, nurserymen, of Genesee County. It is said to be a seedling of\r\nIsabella, resembling the parent very closely, except for being earlier\r\nin ripening. It is now practically out of cultivation, and was never\r\nsuperior to its reputed parent in desirable characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n(=II=) =EUREKA.=\r\n\r\n(Bourquiniana, Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n=1.= _Mo.

It does not\r\nappear ever to have been disseminated except to a few of Dr. Stayman's\r\npersonal friends. It is very rare in varietal vineyards and hardly known\r\nto nurserymen. The variety as it grows in New York is surpassed by its\r\nparent in practically all desirable horticultural characters.\r\n\r\n     Vine a strong grower, usually rather tender, produces medium to\r\n     good crops. Canes long, numerous, slender; tendrils intermittent,\r\n     bifid to trifid. Leaves medium to above in size, variable in\r\n     color; lower surface pale green; pubescence often distributed in\r\n     flecks. Fruit ripens soon after Concord, does not keep well.\r\n     Clusters above medium to medium in size and length,\r\n     single-shouldered to sometimes double-shouldered, of average\r\n     compactness. Berries intermediate in size, roundish, attractive\r\n     dark red, covered with heavy lilac or slightly blue bloom, inclined\r\n     to shell somewhat from pedicel. Skin thin, rather tender, inclined\r\n     to crack. Flesh moderately juicy and tough, aromatic, nearly sweet\r\n     next the skin to acid at center, vinous, desirable in flavor, good\r\n     in quality. Seeds small to medium, of average width and length,\r\n     nearly sharp-pointed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCELSIOR.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n=1.= _Mass. Hort. Soc. Rpt._, =1880=:237. =2.= _Bush.

Ricketts, Excelsior was \"the\r\nfinest grape in his collection.\" The grapes are delicious, having the\r\nflavor of Black Hamburg; the flesh characters are good, the pulp being\r\nmelting and juicy yet holding together and having sugar enough to give\r\nkeeping quality; neither seeds nor skins are objectionable; the grapes\r\nare handsome in appearance; but unfortunately the variety ripens too\r\nlate to make it of much value in New York. At best it is suitable only\r\nfor the amateur and, as with all of the varieties which Ricketts sent\r\nout, it is adapted to few localities and must have the best care in all\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nExcelsior came from seed of Iona fertilized with pollen of some unknown\r\nVinifera. The variety was introduced in the autumn of 1882. Excelsior is\r\nto-day rather rare in varietal vineyards and is apparently not offered\r\nfor sale by any nurserymen.\r\n\r\n     Vine moderately vigorous, not always hardy, medium to productive.\r\n     Canes long, numerous, rather thick; tendrils intermittent, bifid.\r\n     Leaves large to below medium, sometimes rugose; lower surface\r\n     pubescent. Fruit ripens later than Concord, keeps well. Clusters\r\n     unusually large, long, broad, frequently with a heavy double\r\n     shoulder, loose. Berries large to medium, oval to nearly roundish,\r\n     dark red covered with thin lilac bloom, very persistent, rather\r\n     soft. Skin thick, tough, adheres considerably to the pulp. Flesh\r\n     very juicy, rather soft, granular, sweet and sprightly, high in\r\n     flavor, good to best in quality, closely resembling Black Hamburg\r\n     in many characters. Seeds medium in size, rather blunt, sometimes\r\n     with a short enlarged neck.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAITH.\r\n\r\n(Riparia, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n=1.= _Ill. Hort. Soc. Rpt._, =1881=:164. =2.= _Bush.

It is very unattractive in appearance as\r\nit grows in this State, both in cluster and in berry, the clusters being\r\nsmall and variable and the berries small and of unattractive color. The\r\nquality of the fruit is not high and there are many other white sorts\r\nwhich surpass it as a table grape, more especially Diamond which ripens\r\nat the same time. If it has any preeminently good character for this\r\nregion it is productiveness but this cannot offset its mediocre\r\ncharacters. Another fault is that the blossoms put forth so early that\r\nthey often suffer from spring frosts.\r\n\r\nFaith is of the same breeding and from the same originator, Jacob Rommel\r\nof Morrison, Missouri, as Etta, both having come from seed of Elvira.\r\nThis seedling was introduced to the public about 1881 and though an\r\nexcellent grape it is hardly the equal of Etta and has never been able\r\nto compete with that variety. It was named in honor of Jacob Faith, a\r\nprominent Missouri viticulturist.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, hardy except in severe winters, usually\r\n     healthy, variable in productiveness. Canes long to medium,\r\n     numerous; tendrils continuous, bifid. Leaves large to medium, dark\r\n     green; lower surface grayish-green, thinly pubescent. Flowers\r\n     sterile to partly fertile, open medium early; stamens upright.\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Diamond or slightly earlier, does not keep\r\n     well. Clusters above medium to small, variable in length, usually\r\n     slender, often heavily single-shouldered, loose. Berries quite\r\n     small, roundish, dull green, frequently with yellow tinge changing\r\n     to pale amber, covered with abundant gray bloom, persistent, rather\r\n     soft. Flesh moderately juicy, nearly tender, agreeably flavored,\r\n     sweet next the skin to somewhat tart at center, fair to good in\r\n     quality. Seeds numerous, of average size, broad.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERN MUNSON.\r\n\r\n(Lincecumii, Vinifera, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _N. Y. Sta. An. Rpt._, =11=:623. 1892. =2.= _Bush.

FERN (2, 5). _Fern Munson_ (2). _Hilgarde_ (4).\r\n     _Munson's No. 76_ (4).\r\n\r\nFern Munson is not adapted to northern regions, forty degrees north\r\nlatitude being its limit of adaptation according to Munson,[188] its\r\noriginator. Nevertheless when it has ripened in New York the fruit has\r\nshown some very good characters, as attractive appearance, agreeable\r\nquality, and unobjectionable seeds and skin. The vines are vigorous and\r\nproductive but the foliage is not remarkably healthy in the Station\r\nvineyard though it has been very abundant.\r\n\r\nThis variety was originated by T. V. Munson of Denison, Texas, from seed\r\nof Post-oak which has been variously stated to have been pollinated by\r\nTriumph, mixed pollen of Triumph and Herbemont, and by Catawba. Which of\r\nthese is correct we cannot say. The seed was planted in 1885 and the\r\nvariety was introduced by the originator in 1893. It was placed on the\r\ngrape list of the American Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1899,\r\nwhere it still remains. Dickens, of Kansas, states that this variety was\r\nformerly disseminated under the name of Admirable but this appears to be\r\na mistake as Admirable is invariably given as having recurved stamens\r\nwhile the stamens of Fern Munson are erect.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, not always hardy, usually produces as good or\r\n     sometimes better crops than Concord. Canes long, medium or above in\r\n     number, medium to thick, rather dark brown with faint red tinge;\r\n     tendrils intermittent, bifid. Leaves large and thick; upper surface\r\n     rugose and often heavily wrinkled; lower surface dull, pale green\r\n     with slight bronze tinge, faintly pubescent; veins quite obscure.\r\n     Flowers semi-fertile, open very late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens later than Concord, appears to keep well. Clusters\r\n     medium to large, not very long, variable in width, irregularly\r\n     tapering to rather cylindrical, usually single-shouldered, variable\r\n     in compactness, often with many abortive fruits. Berries medium to\r\n     large, roundish to slightly flattened, dark purplish-black, rather\r\n     glossy, covered with thin blue bloom, strongly persistent, firm.\r\n     Skin thin, tough, contains a small amount of wine-colored pigment,\r\n     rather astringent. Flesh juicy, tough and solid, becoming tender as\r\n     it reaches maturity, fine-grained, vinous, briskly sub-acid to\r\n     acid, ranking good in quality when properly ripened. Seeds adhere\r\n     somewhat to the pulp, medium in size, rather broad, of average\r\n     length; raphe shows as a small cord; chalaza central to slightly\r\n     above center, obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORENCE.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera, Bourquiniana?)\r\n\r\n=1.= _Bush. Cat._, =1894=:127.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Florence here described has been discarded by all\r\nvineyardists is presumptive evidence that the variety has little\r\nintrinsic value and this proves to be the case in New York. Neither\r\nfruit nor vine characters are such that the Station can recommend it. It\r\nis doubtful if the variety is longer worthy of preservation.\r\n\r\nFlorence is one of the productions of A. J. Caywood of Marlboro, New\r\nYork, from seed of Niagara pollinated by Dutchess. But little is known\r\nof its time of origin or of its introduction. It is very rare in\r\nvarietal vineyards and not known to nurserymen.\r\n\r\n     Canes medium to above in length, often somewhat slender, slightly\r\n     roughened and pubescent; tendrils intermittent, bifid. Stamens\r\n     upright. Fruit ripens slightly earlier than Niagara, does not keep\r\n     well. Clusters above medium in size, rather long to medium,\r\n     sometimes slightly single-shouldered, loose. Berries large to above\r\n     medium, roundish, green often with tinge of yellow, covered with\r\n     thin gray bloom, nearly persistent.

Fruit and clusters are large\r\nand handsomely colored making a showy grape which attracts attention\r\nwherever shown and which sells in fancy fruit stores at the highest\r\nprice. The plant is vigorous, productive, and as hardy as any of the\r\nprimary hybrids between Labrusca and Vinifera. In view of its good\r\nqualities Gaertner has not received the attention it deserves from\r\neither the amateur or the commercial grape-grower, probably because it\r\nis more capricious as to soils than some others of its related hybrids\r\nand that to have it in perfection it must have the very best care. As a\r\nmarket grape it has the faults of ripening somewhat unevenly and of\r\nshipping rather poorly because of a thin tender skin. As with nearly all\r\nof the hybrids of its kind it keeps well and this, with the desirable\r\nqualities above noted, makes it a splendid grape for the home vineyard\r\nwhere in favorable situations it may be expected to bear annual crops of\r\nmost excellent grapes. Gaertner is often compared with Massasoit, the\r\ntwo varieties being very similar in fruit characters, but Gaertner is of\r\ndistinctly better quality than Massasoit.\r\n\r\nGaertner was originated by E. S. Rogers of Salem, Massachusetts, and the\r\nearly history of the variety will be found under \"Rogers' Hybrids.\" It\r\nwas first mentioned separately from the other seedlings of Rogers about\r\n1865 under the name _Rogers' No. 14_. In 1869, at the request of the\r\nLake Shore Grape Association, Rogers gave names to certain of his\r\nproductions which had previously been known by numbers only. One of the\r\nvarieties then named was Gaertner, in honor of the German botanist of\r\nthis name. It has never been as popular as some of the other Rogers'\r\nhybrids and is to-day offered for sale by but few nurserymen.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, usually hardy except in severe winters,\r\n     produces fair to good crops. Canes rather long; intermediate in\r\n     number, medium to below in size, vary in color from dark\r\n     reddish-brown to ash-gray tinge, surface covered with thin blue\r\n     bloom; tendrils continuous, bifid to trifid. Leaves medium to above\r\n     in size, often rather roundish; upper surface moderately dark\r\n     green, intermediate in thickness; lower surface pale green,\r\n     pubescent; veins distinct. Flowers sterile, open moderately late;\r\n     stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Concord, matures unevenly, keeps only\r\n     fairly well. Clusters above medium to medium in size, short to\r\n     medium, cylindrical to slightly tapering, usually with a fair-sized\r\n     single shoulder but sometimes double-shouldered, rather loose, with\r\n     many abortive fruits. Berries large to below medium, roundish to\r\n     sometimes slightly oval, light to dark red, rather glossy, covered\r\n     with a moderate amount of lilac bloom, persistent, intermediate in\r\n     firmness. Skin medium to thin, inclined to tender, contains no\r\n     pigment. Flesh very pale green, juicy, fine-grained, somewhat\r\n     tough, slightly stringy, agreeably vinous, sweet at skin to tart at\r\n     center, good to very good in quality. Seeds separate from the pulp\r\n     rather easily, large to above medium, intermediate in length, broad\r\n     to medium, distinctly notched, sometimes with a very short enlarged\r\n     neck, brownish; raphe obscured in a deep groove; chalaza of average\r\n     size, above center to nearly central, oval to roundish, somewhat\r\n     obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENEVA.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n=1.= _An.

In quality it is\r\nsomewhat below any of the other grapes put out by Moore and is surpassed\r\nby so many other grapes of its season that it has never become popular\r\nthough it has much to recommend it. Thus it is vigorous, though not\r\nquite hardy, only fairly productive, with ample foliage which is very\r\nhealthy. The berries and clusters are attractive. The color is more\r\nnearly transparent than any other of our grapes and there is so little\r\nbloom that the grapes are a beautiful lustrous green often becoming\r\niridescent in sunlight. It is pure in flavor but somewhat insipid. The\r\nberries cling well to the stem and the fruit keeps exceptionally well.\r\n\r\nGeneva was originated by Jacob Moore, Brighton, Monroe County, New York,\r\nfrom seed planted in 1874 of a hybrid vine fertilized by Iona. The\r\nmaternal vine was from seed of a wild Labrusca fertilized with Muscat\r\nAlexandria. The variety was introduced by the R. G. Chase Company, of\r\nGeneva. It is still quite commonly found in varietal vineyards and is\r\nlisted by a few grape nurserymen. Geneva seems to have succeeded\r\nsomewhat better to the south of New York and is notably better in\r\nquality when grown in lower latitudes.\r\n\r\n     Vine moderately vigorous to vigorous, not very hardy, healthy,\r\n     produces smaller crops than Concord. Canes intermediate in length\r\n     and number, covered with slight blue bloom; tendrils intermittent\r\n     to continuous, bifid to trifid. Leaves medium in size, light\r\n     green; lower surface grayish-white, pubescent. Flowers nearly\r\n     sterile to partly fertile, open medium late; stamens upright. Fruit\r\n     ripens soon after Niagara, ships well and keeps into the winter.\r\n     Clusters medium to above in size, of average width, often blunt at\r\n     ends, usually not shouldered, intermediate in compactness, with\r\n     many abortive fruits. Berries medium to large, slightly oval or\r\n     obovate, dull green changing to a faint yellow tinge, covered with\r\n     thin gray bloom. Flesh pale green, tender and soft, vinous, nearly\r\n     sweet at skin to tart at center, fair to good in quality but not\r\n     equal to some other white grapes of the same season. Seeds\r\n     intermediate in size and length.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLENFELD.[189]\r\n\r\n(Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n=1.= _N. Y. Sta. An. Rpt._, =11=:624. 1892. =2.= _Am. Pom. Soc. Cat._,\r\n=1897=:19. =3.= _N. Y.

It is\r\nequaled or surpassed, however, by many other varieties of its season in\r\nvine characters and there is therefore little need that it should be\r\nlonger perpetuated, though it may be worthy a place in the garden.\r\n\r\nGlenfeld was found on the place of George J. Magee of Watkins, New York.\r\nMr. Magee reports that the vine was on the place when he purchased it\r\nand the former owner knew nothing of it. The variety was locally\r\nsupposed to be a seedling of Concord. It was sent to this Station for\r\ntesting in 1889. For some reason it was placed upon the grape list of\r\nthe American Pomological Society fruit catalog for 1897. Such action was\r\nhardly justified, as the variety had never been tested except in one or\r\ntwo neighborhoods, and it was taken off at the next meeting.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy except in severe winters, produces good crops.\r\n     Canes long, numerous to medium, intermediate in thickness; tendrils\r\n     continuous to intermittent, bifid to trifid. Leaves often very\r\n     large, variable in color, medium to thick; lower surface tinged\r\n     with bronze, strongly pubescent. Flowers nearly fertile, open in\r\n     mid-season or earlier; stamens upright. Fruit ripens early in\r\n     October, keeps fairly well. Clusters large to below medium,\r\n     variable in shape, usually with a medium-sized single shoulder,\r\n     not uniform in compactness. Berries nearly large to below medium,\r\n     roundish, unique in color being a rather dull olive green covered\r\n     with ash-gray bloom, somewhat inclined to shatter. Flesh tender,\r\n     vinous, with an agreeable flavor, sweet at skin to tart at center,\r\n     good in quality. Seeds medium to below in size, broad.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOETHE.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n=1.= _Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt._, =1860=:86. =2.= _Mass. Hort. Soc.

When it does\r\nripen in northern latitudes it is unsurpassed in flavor by any other of\r\nthe grapes of its class. The vine is hardy in New York; vigorous to a\r\nfault, for in very rich soils it makes too great a growth; it does best\r\nin sands or gravels; it is fairly immune to mildew, rot and other\r\ndiseases; and where it succeeds often bears so freely that thinning\r\nbecomes a necessity. Added to its high quality, which makes it a\r\nsplendid table grape, Goethe keeps well, lasting long into the winter.\r\nIt is excellent for wine though it is too difficult to grow to make it\r\nprofitable for this purpose. Unfortunately this variety ripens so late\r\nthat it cannot be recommended for New York. The accompanying color-plate\r\ndoes not do the variety full justice as good specimens could not be\r\nobtained for illustration in the unfavorable season of 1907. Neither\r\nsize, nor shape of cluster, nor color of fruit are quite as we should\r\nlike to have them shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOETHE]\r\n\r\nE. S. Rogers of Salem, Massachusetts, produced Goethe as one of his\r\nfamous Labrusca-Vinifera hybrids and for its early history the reader is\r\nreferred to \"Rogers' Hybrids.\" It is first mentioned separately from\r\nothers of these productions in 1858 under the name _Rogers' No. 1_. It\r\nwas placed upon the grape list of the American Pomological Society\r\nfruit catalog in 1867, where it still remains. In 1869 Mr. Rogers named\r\nthe grape Goethe after the great German poet and naturalist. While\r\nhighly esteemed in the North, it succeeds better and is therefore more\r\ncommonly grown in the Middle and South Atlantic States and in the\r\nvalleys of the Ohio and of the lower Missouri.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to medium, hardy, variable in productiveness,\r\n     somewhat subject to mildew in unfavorable locations. Canes above\r\n     medium to short, of average number and thickness, rather dark\r\n     brown; nodes enlarged, slightly flattened; internodes very short;\r\n     diaphragm thick; pith below medium in size; shoots strongly\r\n     pubescent; tendrils continuous with tendency to intermittent,\r\n     rather long, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds intermediate in size, length and thickness, conical to\r\n     nearly obtuse, open very late. Young leaves tinged lightly on under\r\n     side and along margin of upper side with rose-carmine. Leaves\r\n     variable in size, irregularly roundish, medium to somewhat thin;\r\n     upper surface light green, glossy, of average smoothness; lower\r\n     surface pale green to bronze, pubescent, veins very distinct; leaf\r\n     usually not lobed, with terminus broadly acute; petiolar sinus of\r\n     average depth, narrow, closed and frequently overlapping; basal\r\n     sinus usually lacking; lateral sinus shallow, often a mere notch;\r\n     teeth shallow to medium, rather narrow. Flowers partly fertile,\r\n     open in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens considerably later than Concord, keeps unusually well.\r\n     Clusters intermediate in size, short to medium, rather broad,\r\n     widely tapering, frequently single-shouldered, usually two bunches\r\n     to a shoot, intermediate in compactness; peduncle short to medium,\r\n     of average thickness; pedicel nearly long, thick, covered with\r\n     numerous, conspicuous warts, wide at point of attachment to berry;\r\n     brush long, slender to stout, pale green to yellowish-brown.\r\n     Berries very large to above medium, oval to nearly roundish, pale\r\n     red, covered with thin gray or slightly lilac bloom, persistent, of\r\n     average firmness. Skin thin, tender to medium, adheres slightly to\r\n     the pulp, contains no pigment, faintly astringent. Flesh pale\r\n     green, translucent, inclined to tenderness, rather coarse, nearly\r\n     sweet at skin but decidedly tart at center, with some Vinifera\r\n     sprightliness, ranking good to very good in quality, does not reach\r\n     its best flavor in many localities in this State. Seeds separate\r\n     from the pulp with difficulty unless fully ripe, one to three,\r\n     average two, large, long, of average thickness, very slightly\r\n     notched, inclined to bluntness, brownish; raphe obscure; chalaza of\r\n     fair size, decidedly above center, pear-shaped, distinct. Must 78°.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOFF.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera, Aestivalis.)\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter century the New York Agricultural Experiment Station\r\nhas been in existence, the breeding of grapes has been one of the chief\r\nlines of horticultural work. Professor E. S. Goff, the first Station\r\nhorticulturist, began this work as early as 1885 and produced a number\r\nof seedling grapes which were numbered but not named. In continuing this\r\nwork, Professor S. A. Beach, successor to Professor Goff, planted seed\r\nfrom some of the original seedlings and from one of these came a\r\nsomewhat remarkable grape to which we have given the name Goff. This new\r\nvariety first bore fruit in 1898 and at once attracted attention. In\r\n1901 it was awarded a silver medal as a meritorious seedling at the\r\nPan-American Exposition. Specimens of it sent to several viticultural\r\nexperts were highly spoken of and in the years it has been in fruit on\r\nthe Station grounds it has made a most excellent record.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the pedigree of this grape can never be known. Not only\r\nwere the parents of the original seedling unknown, but the immediate\r\nparent was open to cross-pollination in a vineyard of many varieties.\r\nAll who have examined the fruit and vines of Goff are well agreed that\r\nthe variety shows very distinctly Labrusca and Vinifera characters and\r\nsome maintain that there are indications of Aestivalis as well. As to\r\nthe proportion of these three species, if all be present, no one would\r\ncare to hazard a guess.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of Goff is well shown in the accompanying\r\ncolor-plate though the cylindrical shape and enlarged lower end of the\r\nbunch are more pronounced than in typical specimens. Because of the\r\npeculiar shape of both bunch and berry the fruit cannot be called\r\nhandsome though the color is sufficiently attractive. The quality of\r\nGoff is of the highest, being hardly surpassed by any of the commonly\r\ngrown grapes of this country. The flavor is sweet, rich and vinous and\r\nthe pulp, while firm, is tender and readily parts from the seeds. In\r\ngeneral the flavor is that of a Labrusca-Vinifera hybrid though there is\r\na spiciness in it that suggests an admixture of Aestivalis; the flesh\r\ncharacters are better than those of the average hybrid of the two first\r\nnamed species, being less pulpy and coarse. Probably the most valuable\r\ncharacter of Goff is the long keeping quality of the fruit in which\r\nrespect it far surpasses the several commercial varieties of this State\r\nand equals the best keeping American grapes known. In a test during the\r\nwinter of 1907-08 of the keeping qualities of 255 varieties of grapes\r\nfrom the Station vineyards, kept in eight-pound baskets in common\r\nstorage, unwrapped, Goff was one of the four best keepers, Canandaigua,\r\nWilder and Vergennes being the other three. These four varieties kept in\r\nvery good condition until April 16, and under circumstances not\r\naltogether favorable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOFF]\r\n\r\nThe vine characters of Goff are exceptionally good on the Station\r\ngrounds. The vines are vigorous, hardy, very productive, and the foliage\r\nis healthy. All of the above characters are developed to an extent\r\nseldom found in a variety showing the specific blood indicated in the\r\nGoff. In these respects, taking all of them, this variety surpasses any\r\nof Rogers' hybrids, grapes with which it can be best compared. The\r\nvariety is now distributed for testing in the various grape regions of\r\nthe State and if the reports of its behavior are satisfactory, it will\r\nbe generally distributed within a few years.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to very vigorous, hardy, very productive.

Unfortunately the variety is\r\nonly of general interest in New York as it does not succeed so far\r\nnorth, the summer seasons being too short. Where it succeeds it is a\r\nhandsome market variety of very good quality and makes an excellent\r\nwhite wine. The vines are productive and are reported to be unusually\r\nfree from attacks of fungal diseases.\r\n\r\nAs indicated in the preceding paragraph, this variety was originated by\r\nT. V. Munson of Denison, Texas. It sprung from seed of Cynthiana or\r\nNorton[191] pollinated by Martha which was planted in 1883 and was\r\nintroduced by the originator in 1894.

Its hardiness and\r\nearliness might make it a valuable grape for northern latitudes where\r\nmore commonly cultivated varieties do not mature with certainty. It is\r\nsomewhat susceptible to fungal diseases, mildew especially, and needs\r\nmore than ordinary care.\r\n\r\nThis variety was originated by C. G. Pringle of Charlotte, Vermont, from\r\nseed of Adirondac fertilized with Delaware, planted in 1869 and\r\nintroduced by B. K. Bliss of New York, about 1880. It has never been\r\npopular but is still sold by an occasional nurseryman.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to weak, not productive, inclined to mildew.

This variety is\r\nnot to be confused with \"Chas. A. Green,\" also a white grape, which was\r\noriginated by F. W. Loudon of Janesville, Wisconsin, and was introduced\r\nby Chas. A. Green of Rochester. We have not been able to get a complete\r\ndescription of the latter variety.\r\n\r\nGreen Early was found growing by the side of a ditch near a Concord\r\nvineyard, on land belonging to O. J. Greene of Portland, Chautauqua\r\nCounty, New York. The vine was transplanted into a nursery in 1887. The\r\nparentage of the variety is unknown but it is credited to Concord owing\r\nto its resemblance to that variety. It was introduced in the late\r\nnineties by J. H. Greene of Portland, New York, and H. W. Blowers of\r\nWestfield, New York.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to very vigorous, usually hardy, productive. Canes\r\n     variable in length and thickness, dark-reddish brown; tendrils\r\n     continuous, sometimes intermittent, bifid to trifid. Leaves\r\n     variable in size, medium green; lower surface pale green,\r\n     pubescent; stamens upright. Fruit ripens about with Moore Early or\r\n     with Concord in some locations, does not keep long and is only a\r\n     fair shipper. Clusters variable in size, length and breadth,\r\n     sometimes single-shouldered, variable in compactness. Berries above\r\n     medium to nearly small, oval to slightly roundish, light green\r\n     tinged with yellow, covered with thin gray bloom, moderately\r\n     persistent, rather soft. Skin nearly thin, tender, inclined to\r\n     crack. Flesh slightly tough and aromatic, almost sweet at skin to\r\n     acid at center, fair flavor and quality.

It is very similar to Missouri Riesling but is, on the\r\nStation grounds, and in general, a much stronger grower. For a variety\r\nof the Taylor group, both cluster and berry are large and uniform,\r\nwhich, with the attractive golden color of the berries, make it a most\r\nhandsome fruit. But as the variety grows in New York the flavor is not\r\nat all pleasing, being an unusual commingling of sweetness and acidity\r\nquite disagreeable to most palates; and so while its habit of growth,\r\nhardiness, health of vine and productiveness are such as would make the\r\nvariety acceptable the quality of the fruit condemns it for table use.\r\nIn fact the last remark applies in a greater or less degree to all of\r\nthe varieties of the Taylor group for this State--they fall so far short\r\nin quality that they can never be of value as market or table grapes.\r\nAll are suitable for wine and Grein Golden in particular is said to make\r\na very good white wine. The fruit of this variety cracks badly in wet\r\nweather and does not keep nor ship well, skin and flesh being very\r\ntender.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREIN GOLDEN]\r\n\r\nNicholas Grein of Hermann, Missouri, produced Grein Golden over thirty\r\nyears ago. It is generally supposed to be from seed of Taylor. Grein\r\nstates that he planted seed of the European Riesling and of Taylor at\r\nthe same time, and that the Taylor did not germinate but that the\r\nEuropean Riesling did, one of the seedlings being Grein Golden. As the\r\nGrein Golden shows Riparia very plainly, with no trace of Vinifera, it\r\nis generally supposed that the seeds were mixed and that Grein Golden is\r\na Taylor seedling. The variety has been and still is a commercial sort\r\nin the wine districts of the middle West.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes long to medium, numerous,\r\n     somewhat slender, rather dark reddish-brown; nodes slightly\r\n     enlarged, usually flattened; internodes long to medium; diaphragm\r\n     of average thickness; pith intermediate in size; shoots pubescent;\r\n     tendrils intermittent, of fair length, trifid to sometimes bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds of average size, short to medium, intermediate in\r\n     thickness, conical to pointed, open in mid-season. Young leaves\r\n     faintly tinged on lower side only with faintest rose carmine.\r\n     Leaves large to medium, thick; upper surface dark green, dull,\r\n     moderately smooth; lower surface pale green, slightly pubescent;\r\n     veins not conspicuous; lobes none to three with terminus acute;\r\n     petiolar sinus deep, medium to narrow; basal sinus usually lacking;\r\n     lateral sinus shallow, wide, frequently obscure; teeth medium to\r\n     deep, of average width. Flowers sterile, open in mid-season;\r\n     stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Niagara, does not keep nor ship well.\r\n     Clusters large, long to medium, somewhat broad, tapering,\r\n     irregular, often heavily single-shouldered, loose to moderately\r\n     compact; peduncle above average length, thickish; pedicel\r\n     intermediate in length and thickness, covered with few,\r\n     inconspicuous warts; brush slender, medium in length, pale green.\r\n     Berries uniform in size, rather large, roundish, attractive light\r\n     green often with tinge of golden yellow or pinkish-yellow, glossy,\r\n     covered with thin gray bloom, persistent, intermediate in firmness.\r\n     Skin very thin, tender, often inclined to crack, does not adhere to\r\n     the pulp, contains no pigment. Flesh greenish, translucent, very\r\n     juicy, tender, vinous, slightly sweet next the skin but decidedly\r\n     acid at center, medium to good in quality, better than Elvira.\r\n     Seeds separate easily from the pulp when mature, two to four in\r\n     number, average two and three, above medium in size, broad,\r\n     intermediate in length, plump, light to dark brown; raphe shows as\r\n     a small but prominent cord; chalaza rather large, at center or\r\n     slightly above, oval, usually distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARTFORD.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera?)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mag.

It is now being very largely\r\nsuperseded, and greatly to the betterment of viticulture, by other\r\ngrapes of its season of better quality, though it is still quite\r\ncommonly grown in New York at least. It is probable that for many years\r\nthere will be locations in which Hartford may be profitably cultivated\r\n(some in which it alone will be worth growing), and purposes for which\r\nit may be recommended. The many good characters of the vine make it a\r\ndesirable grape for breeding work.\r\n\r\nThe vine of Hartford can be well characterized by its good qualities but\r\nthe fruit is best described through its faults. The plants are vigorous,\r\nprolific, healthy, and the fruit is borne early in the season, ripening\r\nfrom a week to two weeks in advance of the Concord. After Concord the\r\nHartford is one of the most fruitful of American grapes. The canes are\r\nremarkable for their stoutness and for the crooks at the joints. The\r\nbunches are not unattractive (the color-plate fails to do them justice\r\nas to size and color), but the quality of the fruit is low, even for an\r\nearly grape where the highest quality is hardly expected. The flesh is\r\npulpy and unpleasant to eat while the flavor is both too insipid and too\r\nfoxy to be good. Because of its poor quality, now that there are so many\r\nreally good early grapes, Hartford should be discarded. But there is\r\nanother reason for ceasing its culture. The berries shell badly either\r\non the vine or when packed for shipping, so that the fruit neither\r\nships, packs, nor keeps well. The competition of the southern states\r\nfrom which later and better varieties can be shipped to northern cities\r\nto compete with Hartford is still another reason for the passing of this\r\nvariety from commercial cultivation. Still other faults are that it\r\ncolors a long while before it is ripe; and it is only partly\r\nself-fertile so that in seasons when there is bad weather during\r\nblooming time the clusters are usually loose and straggling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARTFORD]\r\n\r\nThe original vine of Hartford was a chance seedling in the garden of\r\nPaphro Steele of West Hartford, Connecticut. It fruited for the first\r\ntime in 1849. This seedling was supposed by those familiar with the\r\nsurroundings at the time to be a cross of Isabella and the wild fox\r\ngrape. It was named Hartford Prolific by the Hartford County\r\nHorticultural Society. The American Pomological Society placed it in\r\ntheir fruit catalog in 1862 and it has never been removed. The word\r\n\"Prolific\" appears to have been dropped from this name by common consent\r\nabout 1890.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, injured in severe winters, very productive\r\n     as an early grape. Does not require as close pruning as many other\r\n     varieties. Canes above medium in length, intermediate in number,\r\n     not thick, dark brown, covered with considerable pubescence; nodes\r\n     enlarged, flattened; internodes medium to short; diaphragm medium\r\n     to below in thickness; pith of average size; shoots very pubescent;\r\n     tendrils continuous, long, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds of average size, short, thick to medium, obtuse to\r\n     conical. Leaves nearly large, thick; upper surface dark green,\r\n     dull, rugose; lower surface pale green, often with trace of bronze,\r\n     thinly pubescent; veins indistinct; lobes variable with terminus\r\n     blunt to acute; petiolar sinus medium to deep, narrow; basal sinus\r\n     usually lacking; lateral sinus shallow, narrow, often a mere notch;\r\n     teeth shallow, of average width. Flowers fertile, open in\r\n     mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens early, does not keep well. Clusters above average\r\n     size, nearly long, slender except when shouldered, slightly\r\n     tapering, irregular, often with a long, large, single shoulder,\r\n     loose; peduncle long to medium, of fair size; pedicel short,\r\n     intermediate in thickness, covered with few small warts; brush\r\n     greenish with dull tinge of reddish-brown. Berries regular in size\r\n     averaging above medium, roundish to oval, black, not glossy,\r\n     covered with blue bloom, drop badly from pedicel, of average\r\n     firmness. Skin thick, tough, adheres considerably to the pulp,\r\n     contains much purplish-red pigment, somewhat astringent. Flesh\r\n     greenish, translucent, juicy, toughish, stringy and foxy, rather\r\n     sweet at skin but somewhat tart at center, resembles Concord but\r\n     ranks below that variety in flavor and quality.

Hayes_ (2,\r\n     6). _Moore's No. 31_ (2).\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the Massachusetts Horticultural Society awarded a first class\r\ncertificate of merit to Hayes and it was very favorably spoken of by\r\nmany expert grape-growers in New England and the East. These\r\nrecommendations brought it prominently before grape-growers and for a\r\ntime it was a somewhat popular variety, but as it became better known\r\nseveral defects became apparent and its popularity waned. The vine is\r\nhardy and vigorous but the growth is slow and in New York at least the\r\nvariety is a shy or precarious bearer and both bunches and berries are\r\ntoo small and variable to make it an attractive grape. Besides it comes\r\nat a time, a week or ten days earlier than Concord, when there are many\r\nother really good green grapes. Excellent though it is in quality, it is\r\nhardly worth giving a place in this State for any purpose. The foliage\r\nis tender to the heat of summer and the variety is not therefore adapted\r\nto southern or western localities.\r\n\r\nJohn B. Moore of Concord, Massachusetts, is the originator of Hayes. It\r\nis said to be a seedling of Concord and one of the same lot of seedlings\r\nas Moore Early. It was first fruited in 1872 and was exhibited at Boston\r\ntwo years later. The variety was not introduced, however, until the fall\r\nof 1884. It is a somewhat remarkable seedling of Concord for it shows no\r\nfoxiness of flavor and has tender, delicate flesh, which taken together\r\nmake it of high quality. Hayes illustrates well the fact mentioned under\r\nConcord that the light colored seedlings of that variety are usually of\r\nhigh quality. The intermittent tendrils and certain characters of the\r\nseeds indicate that there is some species present besides Labrusca,\r\nprobably Vinifera.\r\n\r\n     Vine variable in vigor and productiveness, usually hardy and\r\n     healthy. Canes intermediate in length, numerous, rather slender;\r\n     tendrils intermittent, bifid to trifid. Leaves not uniform in size,\r\n     nearly dark green; lower surface considerably pubescent. Flowers\r\n     almost sterile, open medium late; stamens upright. Fruit ripens\r\n     from a week to ten days earlier than Concord, keeps well. Clusters\r\n     variable in size and length, often single-shouldered, not uniform\r\n     in compactness. Berries above medium to small, roundish,\r\n     greenish-yellow to slightly golden yellow, covered with thin gray\r\n     bloom, persistent. Skin thin, tender, covered with few small\r\n     reddish-brown dots. Flesh fine-grained, tender, vinous, sweet at\r\n     skin to agreeably tart at center, rather mild, good in quality.\r\n     Seeds few, of average size, medium to short, often plump.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADLIGHT.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca, Bourquiniana.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Rural N.

Its meritorious characters\r\nare: Productiveness, outyielding Delaware with which it would compete in\r\nNew York; disease-resistant foliage and vines little affected by mildew\r\nand rarely attacked by black-rot even in the South; more than average\r\nvigor of vine, though it has fallen short of expectations in this\r\nrespect in the Station vineyard; high quality of the fruit, being almost\r\nthe equal of Delaware in flavor and having tender melting pulp which\r\nreadily parts from the seeds; and earliness, ripening before Delaware\r\nand hanging on the vines or keeping after being picked for some time\r\nwithout deterioration in either quality or appearance. Though a southern\r\ngrape it has proved perfectly hardy here and were it not that it must\r\ncompete in the North with many other good grapes, Delaware in\r\nparticular, it might take high place in northern viticulture. Even with\r\nsuch competition it is well worth a trial in either the amateur or\r\ncommercial vineyards of New York. It would seem that for the South its\r\nresistance to disease should make it a valuable commercial variety.\r\n\r\nThe originator of Headlight, T. V. Munson, states in a personal letter\r\nthat it came from Moyer seed fertilized by Brilliant. The seed from\r\nwhich the variety came was planted in 1895 and the new grape was\r\nintroduced in 1901 by the producer. While Headlight is as yet\r\ncomparatively little known, it is being tested in many of the grape\r\nregions of the country and its value should soon be known. Such reports\r\nof its behavior as have been made are in the main very favorable.\r\n\r\n     Vine at this Station medium to weak, hardy, very productive. Canes\r\n     short to medium, few in number, slender, dark brown to\r\n     reddish-brown with small amount of bloom at nodes, which are\r\n     enlarged and usually not flattened; internodes short; diaphragm\r\n     thick; pith below medium to nearly small; shoots more or less\r\n     pubescent; tendrils continuous, short, bifid, very persistent.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds small and short, inclined to slender, pointed to conical,\r\n     open late. Young leaves heavily tinged on under side and lightly on\r\n     the upper side with bright carmine.

The variety is injured by\r\ncold below zero or thereabouts and cannot be grown north of the Ohio\r\nRiver and fails somewhat in Missouri and Arkansas because of its\r\ntenderness. It requires, too, a long season for perfect maturity.\r\nHerbemont is also fastidious as to soil and its cultivation is somewhat\r\nlimited by this factor. It requires a well-drained warm soil and one\r\nwhich is abundantly supplied with humus; though the variety often\r\nthrives on the comparatively poor hill-land of the South. Despite these\r\nlimitations, this variety is grown in an immense territory, extending\r\nfrom Virginia and Tennessee to the Gulf and westward through Texas. The\r\nsynonyms given above are many of them allusions to the localities in\r\nwhich it has been grown, while most of the others pertain to its origin,\r\nbut all show to some extent the wide dissemination of this grape and\r\nindicate in a measure its merit.\r\n\r\nHerbemont is known and widely grown in Europe as well as in the southern\r\nUnited States. In southwestern France where the demands of the variety\r\nseem to be particularly well fulfilled, it is firmly established and is\r\nhighly regarded as a direct producer. In northern and central France,\r\nhowever, the winters are too cold and the seasons too short for its\r\nprofitable culture. Its use as a stock in France is limited for it has\r\nbeen found to be but medium in its resistance to phylloxera; does not\r\ngrow well from cuttings and is therefore propagated with difficulty; the\r\nwood does not bear grafts well and is worked with difficulty in either\r\nfield or bench grafting; and lastly the French find it very subject to\r\nchlorosis, especially in calcareous soils.\r\n\r\nThe vine is, according to all accounts, a remarkably vigorous, rapid and\r\nhealthy grower, being hardly surpassed in these characters by any of our\r\nnative grapes. The wood is strong, abundant and very hard, the latter a\r\nserious difficulty in grafting. The fruits are attractive because of the\r\nsize of the bunch and the glossy black of the berries, which are small\r\nas compared with northern grapes. Fruit is borne abundantly and with\r\ncertainty year in and year out in suitable localities. The flesh\r\ncharacters of the fruit are good for a small grape, neither flesh, skin\r\nnor seeds being especially objectionable in eating; the pulp is tender\r\nand juicy; rich, sweet and highly flavored, the combination of flesh and\r\nflavor characters giving a grape of high quality. Herbemont is greatly\r\nesteemed as a table grape and is said to make a very good light red\r\nwine. The ample, lustrous green foliage makes the variety one of the\r\nattractive ornamental plants of the South.\r\n\r\nHerbemont has been much used in grape-breeding and to advantage, for\r\nprobably no other species offers as many desirable characters for the\r\nSouth and Southwest as the one to which this variety belongs and best\r\nrepresents. There are now several pure-bred seedlings of Herbemont under\r\ncultivation and a greater number in which it is one of the parents. Of\r\nthe former Black Herbemont and the Onderdonk are good representatives\r\nand Jaeger, Delicious, Muench, Vinita, Perry, Mrs. Munson and Neva\r\nMunson, all from Munson of Texas, are Herbemont cross-breeds.\r\n\r\nThe history of Herbemont, as it must be written from such information as\r\ncan now be obtained, is scarcely more than a collection of mythical\r\nstories. The variety is known to have been in cultivation in Georgia\r\nbefore the Revolutionary War, when it was generally known under the name\r\nof Warrenton or Warren. In the early part of the last century it came to\r\nthe hands of Nicholas Herbemont of Columbia, South Carolina, who gave it\r\nthe name Madeira under a temporary supposition that it came from the\r\nisland of that name. This name was generally changed to Herbemont's\r\nMadeira. Herbemont made the variety known to the public, sending it to\r\nWilliam R. Prince of Flushing, Long Island, and Nicholas Longworth of\r\nCincinnati, the two most prominent viticulturists of that time who, in\r\nturn, aided in its distribution.\r\n\r\nThere have been many contradictory accounts of the origin of the grape,\r\ncrediting it to Georgia, the Carolinas, or Europe. None is supported by\r\nsufficient evidence to make it creditable and most of them arose at so\r\nlate a date that it was impossible for the writers to know anything\r\nabout the facts of the case except by hearsay evidence. The early idea\r\nof many that it is a Vinifera was soon dropped. Later this variety and\r\nothers of its class were known as southern Aestivalis; however, it was\r\nadmitted that they were unlike other southern Aestivalis. Munson gave\r\nthese grapes the name Bourquiniana, a name that has been accepted as a\r\nconvenient designation for the group by some who do not accept his\r\naccount of its origin. The Herbemont and Lenoir are the two varieties\r\ncommonly referred to as typical of this so-called species.\r\n\r\nThe history of the culture of Herbemont in the North has been the same\r\neverywhere. It was early introduced around Cincinnati, Ohio, and\r\nHermann, Missouri, and for a time the growers had high hopes of its\r\nvalue. It winter-killed slightly but they overcame this by covering the\r\nvines; then the variety showed itself susceptible to rot and its culture\r\nwas soon dropped. In 1867 the Herbemont was placed on the grape list of\r\nthe American Pomological Society fruit catalog and it has never been\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nWe have no vines of Herbemont growing in the Station vineyard and the\r\nfollowing description has been collected from a variety of sources.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to very vigorous. Canes rather long and strong,\r\n     bright green, with more or less purple, with considerable\r\n     bluish-white bloom; internodes short; tendrils intermittent, of\r\n     medium size, bifid or trifid.

Barry\r\nequals it and possibly surpasses it to the taste of most grape\r\nconnoisseurs in delicacy of flavor but Herbert is the handsomer fruit,\r\nis a little earlier and if anything its vine characters are somewhat\r\nbetter. When at its best, Herbert, and Barry too, nearly equal Black\r\nHamburg in the characters that constitute high quality. They lack the\r\nrichness of the Old World variety but they are more sprightly and\r\nrefreshing and do not cloy the appetite as does the Vinifera variety. In\r\nall that constitutes a fine table grape Herbert is about as near\r\nperfection as we have yet reached in the evolution of American grapes.\r\nAs is the case with most black grapes the fruit colors long before it is\r\nripe and when thus picked there is an astringency in its taste that\r\nwholly disappears when the fruit is fully ripe. For a Vinifera-Labrusca\r\nhybrid the Herbert is vigorous, hardy and fruitful ranking in these\r\nrespects above many pure-bred Labruscas. While the fruit ripens with\r\nConcord it keeps long after and is a very good winter grape. It keeps,\r\npacks and ships well. It is unable to fertilize itself and must be set\r\nnear other varieties. Herbert is well deserving attention from\r\ncommercial growers who supply a discriminating market and its many good\r\nqualities will give it a high place in the esteem of grape connoisseurs.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the origin and early history of Herbert the reader is\r\nreferred to \"Rogers' Hybrids.\" The Herbert is first mentioned separately\r\nfrom the rest of Rogers' seedlings in 1865, under the designation\r\n_Rogers' No. 44_. In 1869 Rogers gave names to several of his seedlings\r\nand the _Rogers' No. 44_ received the name Herbert. The same year it was\r\nplaced on the grape list of the American Pomological Society fruit\r\ncatalog. It has never been cultivated extensively but has always been a\r\nfavorite with amateur growers. The differences in the descriptions\r\nfurnished by different growers leads one to suspect that there are two\r\nor more varieties passing under this name.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to very vigorous, injured in severe winters,\r\n     productive. Canes very long, numerous, unusually thick, dark brown;\r\n     nodes enlarged, somewhat flattened; internodes long to medium;\r\n     diaphragm thick; pith medium to large; shoots pubescent; tendrils\r\n     intermittent, long, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds above medium in size, shortish, plump, obtuse, open\r\n     early.

The fruit is\r\nhandsomely colored and the cluster, when at its best, is large and\r\nwell-formed with a striking resemblance to Black Hamburg. The flavor,\r\nwhile not of the best, is good. But large size, handsome appearance, and\r\ngood flavor cannot make up for the several defects of the variety. The\r\nfruit drops and cracks badly and the pulp is too tough and adheres too\r\nfirmly to the seed for a dessert grape. These faults are so marked as to\r\nmake Hercules almost worthless except for breeding purposes. Added to\r\nthe desirable characters of the fruit given above, the vines are hardy,\r\nvigorous and productive so that this variety offers an unusual array of\r\nvaluable qualities for the grape-breeder.\r\n\r\nAt one time it was claimed that Hercules was a seedling of a California\r\ngrape but later it was said to have come from seed of one of Rogers'\r\nhybrids. This opinion was based solely upon the characters of the plant,\r\nas the originator, the late G. A. Ensenberger of Bloomington, Illinois,\r\ngave no satisfactory account of the parentage of the grape. Hercules was\r\nexhibited at the Columbian Exposition at Chicago, where, on account of\r\nits large size and showy appearance, it attracted much attention. It is\r\nunfortunate that the parentage of this grape is not known as it is\r\nlikely to be used not a little in the grape-breeding of the future in\r\nproducing large-fruited varieties.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to very vigorous, hardy except in extreme winters,\r\n     very productive. Canes long to medium, intermediate in number and\r\n     thickness, brown or dark reddish-brown; nodes slightly enlarged,\r\n     flattened; internodes medium to long; diaphragm thick; pith large\r\n     to medium; shoots slightly pubescent; tendrils continuous, of\r\n     average length, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds medium in size, short, thickish, pointed to conical, open\r\n     in mid-season. Young leaves lightly tinged on lower side and along\r\n     margin of upper side with rose carmine. Leaves large, intermediate\r\n     in thickness; upper surface light green, slightly glossy,\r\n     smoothish; lower surface grayish-green, pubescent; veins distinct;\r\n     lobes none to three, with terminus acute; petiolar sinus deep to\r\n     medium, intermediate to narrow; basal sinus usually absent; lateral\r\n     sinus shallow to a mere notch; teeth medium to shallow,\r\n     intermediate in width. Flowers sterile, open in mid-season; stamens\r\n     reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit comes in season about with Concord, somewhat subject to rot,\r\n     keeps fairly well. Clusters attractive, somewhat resembling Black\r\n     Hamburg, very large to medium, of average length, broad to medium,\r\n     slightly tapering to nearly cylindrical below the single shoulder,\r\n     one to three clusters per shoot, medium to rather compact; peduncle\r\n     short and thick; pedicel inclined to shortness, thickish, much\r\n     enlarged at point of attachment to the fruit; brush of average\r\n     length, pale green. Berries unusually large but somewhat variable,\r\n     roundish, black, glossy, covered with more or less blue bloom, not\r\n     persistent, firm. Skin cracks badly in some seasons, intermediate\r\n     in thickness and toughness, adheres slightly to the pulp, contains\r\n     some wine-colored pigment, astringent.

When the variety was introduced, fifty or more\r\nyears ago, it was considered a valuable addition to the list of wine\r\ngrapes but it has not grown in favor nor popularity nor been extensively\r\nplanted in any of the grape regions of the South. It is said to be\r\nvigorous, hardy and productive; to defy all attacks of phylloxera; and\r\nto make a very superior wine. But the berries are very small, ripen\r\nvery late, in some localities crack badly and in others rot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERCULES]\r\n\r\nThe variety was originated by F. Langendoerfer of Hermann, Missouri,\r\nfrom seed of Norton planted in 1860. The first fruit was borne in 1863.\r\nAt one time it was considerably planted in Missouri as a wine grape but\r\nit did not become popular nor spread from varietal vineyards to any\r\nextent on account of its lack of quality for either the table or wine.\r\nIt is of interest chiefly as a seedling of Norton and for its very good\r\nvine characters. The following description has been taken from a number\r\nof sources, chiefly from the _Bushberg Catalogue_:\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, somewhat tender, resembling Norton in foliage except\r\n     that the leaves are of a lighter color and somewhat more deeply\r\n     lobed. Stamens erect. Clusters long and narrow, rather compact,\r\n     rarely shouldered. Berries small, round, black with blue bloom;\r\n     pulp tender, juicy, and of the characteristic spicy Aestivalis\r\n     flavor. Must heavy and very fragrant, brownish-yellow making a wine\r\n     the color of Brown Sherry or Madeira, of great body and fine\r\n     flavor; registers 94°-105°.\r\n\r\n\r\nHICKS.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mo.

The\r\nfact that it was introduced some years ago and has not found great favor\r\nwith growers is assumptive evidence that it cannot make headway against\r\nConcord with which it must compete. On the Station grounds it is more\r\nprolific than Concord and its vines are of stronger growth. The variety\r\nis well worthy a trial.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Hicks is apparently unknown. It was introduced in 1898\r\nby Henry Wallis of Wellston, Missouri, who states that it is a chance\r\nseedling sent from California about 1870 to Richard Berry, a well-known\r\nnurseryman of St. Louis County, Missouri. After Berry's death it passed\r\ninto the hands of Wallis, who named it Hicks. It is supposed from its\r\ncharacters to be of Concord parentage.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to very vigorous, hardy, very productive. Canes\r\n     medium to long, numerous, of average thickness, moderately dark\r\n     brown to reddish-brown, surface covered with thin blue bloom;\r\n     tendrils continuous, bifid to trifid. Leaves large, medium to\r\n     thick; upper surface dark green, slightly glossy, of average\r\n     smoothness; lower surface whitish, changing to a rather heavy\r\n     bronze, strongly pubescent; veins well defined. Flowers fertile or\r\n     nearly so, open early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens with Concord or slightly earlier, keeps fairly well.\r\n     Clusters large to medium, long to medium, broad, tapering, often\r\n     single-shouldered, medium in compactness. Berries large, roundish,\r\n     dark purplish-black to black, covered with heavy blue bloom,\r\n     inclined to shatter somewhat when overripe, firm. Skin intermediate\r\n     in thickness, tender, contains a small amount of very dark\r\n     wine-colored pigment. Flesh greenish, juicy, rather tough,\r\n     fine-grained, faintly foxy, sweet at skin to acid at center, mild\r\n     when fully ripe, good in quality. Seeds somewhat adherent, above\r\n     medium in size, short, broad, blunt, brownish; raphe buried in a\r\n     rather broad groove; chalaza of average size, slightly above\r\n     center, oval to circular.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDALGO.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca, Bourquiniana.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Rural N.

While it has not been tried generally, and is not widely\r\nknown as yet, it is accorded a color-plate and a full description in\r\nthis work chiefly because of its remarkably fine quality. It is rich and\r\nsweet, delicately flavored, yet sprightly, and with color, size and form\r\nof berry and bunch so well combined as to make it a singularly handsome\r\nfruit. The skin is thin but firm and the variety keeps well and ships\r\nwell. The vine characters for this State are not well known. On the\r\ngrounds of this Station it is doubtfully hardy, variable in vigor, and\r\nnot always fruitful. While Hidalgo may not prove of value for the\r\ncommercial vineyard, in favorable situations it may be expected to give\r\na supply of choice fruit for the amateur.\r\n\r\nThe parentage of Hidalgo as given by its originator, T. V. Munson, is\r\nDelaware, Goethe and Lindley. The variety was introduced by the\r\noriginator in 1902 and is now being tested in various parts of the\r\ncountry. The reports that come from those who have seen or grown Hidalgo\r\nagree in the main with the characterization given above and bespeak for\r\nit a high degree of popularity, at least as a table grape for the garden\r\nand possibly for the vineyard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIDALGO]\r\n\r\n     Vine variable in vigor, not always hardy, somewhat uncertain in\r\n     bearing. Canes intermediate in length and number, above average\r\n     thickness, dark reddish-brown; nodes enlarged and flattened;\r\n     internodes of fair length; diaphragm thick; pith medium to below in\r\n     size; shoots slightly pubescent to nearly glabrous; tendrils\r\n     intermittent to continuous, intermediate in length, bifid to\r\n     trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds rather small and short, medium to slender, conical to\r\n     pointed, open late.

Leaves medium to large, often irregularly\r\n     roundish, thick; upper surface light green, dull, medium to\r\n     slightly rugose; lower surface pale green to bronze, heavily\r\n     pubescent; veins distinct; lobes three when present with angle at\r\n     terminus variable; petiolar sinus not uniform in depth, narrow,\r\n     sometimes closed and overlapping; basal sinus usually none; lateral\r\n     sinus shallow, narrow, often a mere notch; teeth very shallow,\r\n     narrow to medium. Flowers semi-fertile, open after mid-season;\r\n     stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Concord, keeps and ships well.

The chief trouble\r\nhas been that the variety is too late for New York, ripening with, or a\r\nlittle later than Catawba. When given good care and under favorable\r\nconditions the bunches are unusually large and handsome in appearance,\r\nsometimes attaining a weight of two pounds and having beautiful\r\nbluish-black berries with something of the fine flavor and tender\r\ntexture of the Jura Muscat, one of its parents. The flesh is solid, and\r\nwhile the skin is thin, yet it is firm and the fruit keeps and ships\r\nwell. The vine is fairly vigorous but doubtfully hardy and productive to\r\na fault. In all localities where the climate is sufficiently temperate\r\nand the season sufficiently long for vine and fruit of Highland to\r\ndevelop perfectly, it is one of the choicest of grapes for the amateur.\r\n\r\nThis fine grape was originated at about the close of the Civil War by\r\nJames H. Ricketts of Newburgh, New York, from seed of Concord fertilized\r\nby Jura Muscat. It was introduced by Messrs. Asher Hance & Sons, who\r\nbought it of the originator. It is very common in varietal vineyards but\r\nit has not become popular as a commercial sort; it is a popular grape\r\nfor exhibitions where, when well grown, it is hardly surpassed in\r\nappearance by any other American grape.\r\n\r\n     Vine variable in vigor, productive, healthy, often inclined to\r\n     overbear. Canes long, numerous, medium to thick, light and dark\r\n     brown, often with a dull, ash-gray tinge, covered with thin bloom;\r\n     nodes strongly enlarged, not flattened; internodes medium to very\r\n     long; diaphragm thick; pith large to medium; shoots usually\r\n     pubescent; tendrils intermittent, of average length, bifid to\r\n     trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds large to medium, rather short and thick, obtuse to\r\n     conical. Leaves large, intermediate in thickness, upper surface\r\n     often dark green, dull, medium to rugose; lower surface\r\n     grayish-green, pubescent; veins rather indistinct; lobes none to\r\n     five, with terminal lobe acute to obtuse; petiolar sinus rather\r\n     deep, variable in width; basal sinus shallow, narrow; lateral sinus\r\n     of average depth and width, sometimes a mere notch; teeth rather\r\n     deep and wide. Flowers fertile or nearly so, open in mid-season;\r\n     stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens with Catawba or after, keeps fairly well. Clusters\r\n     large, rather long and broad, tapering, usually single-shouldered\r\n     but sometimes with a double shoulder, usually two bunches per\r\n     shoot, intermediate in compactness; peduncle of average length and\r\n     thickness; pedicel long to medium, moderately thick, nearly smooth;\r\n     brush below average length, green with yellowish-brown tinge.\r\n     Berries large, roundish-oval, dark purplish-black to bluish-black,\r\n     rather dull, covered with dark lilac or slightly blue bloom,\r\n     persistent, moderately firm. Skin intermediate in thickness, tough,\r\n     nearly free from the pulp, contains little, if any, pigment, not\r\n     astringent. Flesh greenish, translucent, juicy, somewhat tender,\r\n     slightly vinous, good in quality. Seeds separate rather easily from\r\n     the pulp, one to six, average three, above medium to large, nearly\r\n     long, intermediate in breadth, slightly notched with a one-sided\r\n     tendency, riper seeds brownish; raphe obscure; chalaza of average\r\n     size, above center, variable in shape, not distinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIGHLAND]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOSFORD.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Can.

HOSFORD'S SEEDLING (1).\r\n\r\nHosford is an offspring of Concord, differing from the parent chiefly in\r\nthe greater size of bunch and berry and in being less fruitful. The\r\nvariety is surpassed by Worden and Eaton, of the same type, and is\r\nprobably not worth cultivation. It is claimed by some that this variety\r\nis identical with Eaton. It is true that Hosford has a marked\r\nresemblance to Eaton but there are noticeable differences in both vine\r\nand fruit characters and the pure seedlings of the two varieties are\r\nentirely different, those of Eaton being much darker in color and more\r\nvigorous. Hosford was sent out several years before Eaton. The vine of\r\nthis variety looks very much like Concord except that the indentations\r\nalong the margins of the leaves are deeper.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the black seedlings of Concord which have been introduced are\r\nlarger in cluster and berry than the parent and either not as high in\r\nquality or no higher, differing materially from Concord's light-colored\r\nseedlings, which are usually smaller in bunch and berry, or at least not\r\nlarger, and of distinctly better quality. Hosford is a typical black\r\nseedling in the above respects.\r\n\r\nThis variety originated in the garden of George Hosford of Ionia,\r\nMichigan. It was found by the owner about 1876 as a chance seedling\r\ngrowing between two Concord vines.\r\n\r\n     Vine not very vigorous, nearly hardy, unproductive. Canes short,\r\n     few in number, rather slender; tendrils continuous, bifid to\r\n     trifid. Leaves medium to below in size, intermediate in thickness;\r\n     lower surface grayish-white to bronze, heavily pubescent. Flowers\r\n     semi-fertile, open in mid-season; stamens upright. Fruit ripens\r\n     shortly before Concord, does not keep very well. Clusters medium to\r\n     large, tapering, slightly shouldered, moderately compact. Berries\r\n     large to medium, roundish to slightly oval, dull black covered with\r\n     abundant blue bloom, persistent. Skin medium to thick, tender.\r\n     Flesh very pale green, unusually juicy, fine-grained, rather\r\n     tender, vinous, sweet, good in quality. Seeds not numerous, nearly\r\n     large, very broad, blunt, plump.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYBRID FRANC.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Rupestris.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Am.

The vine characters are seemingly all\r\ngood,--hardy, vigorous and very productive. The fruit is fit only for\r\nwine being too acid for a table grape. The coloring matter in the fruit\r\nis very intense and it might be used for giving color to wines. Hybrid\r\nFranc is of much interest to the grape-breeder, and experiments with it\r\nas a parent are desirable for New York. The variety is of French origin.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes variable in length,\r\n     numerous, thick to medium, light brown, covered with slight blue\r\n     bloom; nodes enlarged, roundish; internodes very short; diaphragm\r\n     thin; pith unusually large; shoots glabrous; tendrils intermittent,\r\n     often rather long, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds large to medium, short, above average thickness, obtuse\r\n     to conical, open moderately late. Young leaves tinged on upper and\r\n     lower sides with carmine; the tips of the buds in opening show\r\n     strongly the leaf serrations. Leaves very small to medium, rather\r\n     thin; upper surface light green, decidedly glossy, smooth; lower\r\n     surface greenish, showing Riparia characters, quite hairy along\r\n     ribs and larger veins; lobes usually three to five with terminal\r\n     lobe acute to acuminate; petiolar sinus intermediate in depth,\r\n     narrow to medium, sometimes closed and overlapping; basal sinus of\r\n     average depth and width; lateral sinus medium in depth to a mere\r\n     notch; teeth intermediate in depth and width. Flowers semi-fertile,\r\n     open early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens before mid-season, does not always keep well. Clusters\r\n     medium to below in size, short, intermediate in breadth, tapering\r\n     to cylindrical, usually single-shouldered, average three bunches\r\n     per shoot, medium to compact; peduncle below medium length, rather\r\n     slender; pedicel long, slender, covered with few, small,\r\n     inconspicuous warts; brush short, wine-colored. Berries below\r\n     medium to small, uniform, slightly oblate to roundish, black,\r\n     glossy, covered with thick, blue bloom, persistent, firm. Skin\r\n     thin, tender, does not adhere to the pulp, contains a very dark\r\n     wine-colored pigment, not astringent. Flesh pale green, often with\r\n     a slight reddish tinge, translucent, juicy, fine-grained, somewhat\r\n     tender, spicy, tart to acid, fair in quality. Seeds separate easily\r\n     from the pulp, one to five, average three and four, medium to\r\n     small, rather short, intermediate in breadth, light brown; raphe\r\n     obscure; chalaza of average size, slightly above center, oval to\r\n     pear-shaped, distinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HYBRID FRANC]\r\n\r\n\r\nIDEAL.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera, Bourquiniana.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Kan.

In Kansas and Missouri it\r\nis most highly recommended, not only for the high quality of the fruit,\r\nranking with Delaware in quality, but because of vigorous, healthy,\r\nproductive vines. But in New York, on the Station grounds at least, the\r\nvines are precariously hardy and not sufficiently fruitful, healthy nor\r\nvigorous to warrant a very high recommendation for the variety. Were the\r\nvariety of recent introduction it might be recommended for trial but it\r\nhas been grown for more than twenty years and has, therefore, been well\r\ntried and has not proved of general value. It may be worth planting for\r\nhome use.\r\n\r\nOriginated by John Burr of Leavenworth, Kansas, over thirty years ago\r\nfrom seed of Delaware, the attention of the public was attracted to\r\nIdeal about 1890, first by glowing descriptions of the variety from the\r\noriginator and his friend and co-worker, Dr. Stayman, and later by\r\nreports from various persons who had tested the variety. It does not\r\nappear to have ever been regularly introduced but was sent to various\r\npersons for testing by whom it was distributed. It is now found only in\r\nthe occasional variety vineyard and apparently not offered for sale by\r\nany nurserymen. Ideal is better known, and possibly succeeds better in\r\nthe West than in the East.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, not always hardy, productive, but yielding\r\n     smaller crops than Concord; tendrils intermittent, bifid to trifid.\r\n     Canes long, numerous, rather slender. Leaves medium to large,\r\n     variable in color; lower surface pale green, slightly pubescent and\r\n     cobwebby. Fruit ripens about with Delaware, keeps only fairly well.\r\n     Clusters large to above medium, long to medium, often rather broad\r\n     and heavily shouldered, intermediate in compactness.

In appearance and quality Imperial is very good and were\r\nits vine characters better, and were there not so many excellent green\r\ngrapes of its season with which it must compete, the variety would be\r\nmore generally cultivated.\r\n\r\nImperial is a seedling of Iona fertilized by Sarbelle Muscat and was\r\nraised by J.

In spite of these several good qualities it\r\nhas never been very generally grown, chiefly for the reason that it\r\nrequires more care than commercial grape-growers are willing to give\r\ngrapes, though, beside requiring the best of care, its cultivation is\r\nhindered by several serious faults. Iona rivals Delaware as the\r\nstandard in quality of American grapes, though if flavor alone be\r\nconsidered, grape connoisseurs generally agree that it surpasses\r\nDelaware and is the finest flavored of all our grapes.\r\n\r\nIn flavor Iona has a rare combination of sweetness and acidity, pure,\r\ndelicate and vinous. The flesh is transparent, melting, tender, juicy,\r\nand of uniform consistence quite to the center. The seeds are few and\r\nsmall and part readily from the flesh. The color is a peculiar dark-red\r\nwine with a tint of amethyst, somewhat variable and not always\r\nattractive. The bunch, at its best, is large but rather loose with\r\nberries varying somewhat in size and ripening unevenly. It cannot be\r\ncalled a particularly handsome grape. The fruit does not decay readily\r\nand may be kept in a good fruit room until late winter without loss of\r\nflavor and with the berries adhering to the bunch. Beside being a most\r\nexcellent table grape, it is much sought for by wine-makers for\r\nchampagne and for making finely-flavored white wines.\r\n\r\nThe vine characters of Iona are not nearly as good as those of the\r\nfruit. To do well it must have a soil exactly suited to its wants.\r\nSeemingly it does best in deep, dry, sandy or gravelly clays and cannot\r\nbe grown in damp, rich, black soils on the one hand nor poor sands or\r\ngravels on the other. Vergil's lines as to the treatment of soils for\r\nvines are especially applicable to the Iona.\r\n\r\n    \"A free loose earth is what the vines demand,\r\n     Where wind and frost have help'd the lab'rer's hand,\r\n     And sturdy peasants deep have stirr'd the land.\"\r\n\r\nThis variety does especially well when trained against walls or\r\nbuildings, attaining under such conditions rare perfection. It is not\r\nhardy in any but favored localities in New York and in many parts of the\r\nState must have careful winter protection. The vines are not vigorous\r\nand are inclined to overbear, to remedy which it must have close\r\npruning, or be grafted on a strong growing stock. In localities where\r\nmildew and rot thrive Iona is badly attacked by these diseases. The\r\nvines bear early and the fruit ripens at mid-season or shortly after.\r\nIona is a grape for the amateur and for the careful vineyardist. Few\r\nvarieties are more desirable or satisfactory for the garden when\r\nplanted in soils to which it is adapted, when given good care, properly\r\nprotected from cold, and the vines restrained from overbearing.\r\n\r\nIona was originated by Dr. C. W. Grant[192] of Iona Island, Westchester\r\nCounty, New York, and the name commemorates the scene of the\r\nviticultural labors of one of the founders of American viticulture.\r\nGrant states that Iona is from seed of Diana planted in 1855, the plant\r\nfrom which fruited for the first time four years later. Caywood,\r\nhowever, says that Grant informed him that it was found growing as a\r\nchance seedling under a Catawba vine. Since Diana is a seedling of\r\nCatawba there is too little difference in the character of the older\r\nvarieties to enable one to tell from which Iona came. This variety[193]\r\nwas awarded the Greeley prize of $100, offered by Horace Greeley during\r\nthe Civil War for a grape adapted to general cultivation in the Eastern\r\nand Middle States. The requirements which a variety had to possess to\r\nsecure this prize were certainly sufficiently high; it was asked that\r\nthe vine should be as hardy, healthy and vigorous as the strongest\r\nAmerican vine and the fruit of a quality equal to the best European.\r\nSuch a grape would be a boon to European as well as to American\r\ngrape-growers. Though the prize went to Iona it must not be thought that\r\nit meets these requirements.\r\n\r\nIona was introduced by the originator in 1864. It was overpraised,\r\nextensively advertised, and for some time the prices of vines were kept\r\nat an exorbitant figure from which there was a reaction detrimental to\r\nthe variety. It was placed on the grape list of the American Pomological\r\nSociety fruit catalog in 1867. Probably no American variety has been the\r\nsubject of more caustic discussions than this one and it is only within\r\nthe last few years that its merits could be impartially estimated. Iona\r\nwas extensively tried in all the grape regions of America but has been\r\ngenerally dropped as a commercial grape. It is still to be found in all\r\nvarietal vineyards, in occasional commercial plantings and somewhat\r\ncommonly in gardens.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to weak, precariously hardy, unproductive, often\r\n     susceptible to attacks of mildew. Canes short to medium, of average\r\n     number and size, light brown; nodes enlarged, roundish; internodes\r\n     short; diaphragm thick; pith nearly intermediate in size; shoots\r\n     show some pubescence; tendrils intermittent, of average length,\r\n     bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds about medium in size, short to medium, thick, conical to\r\n     pointed, open very late.

PEARSON'S IRONCLAD (4). _Pearson's\r\n     Ironclad_ (5). _Scott_ (4, 5).\r\n\r\nIronclad is of interest because of its history, and because of its\r\npossible value for breeding purposes. If the history given below is\r\ncorrect, this variety is one of the oldest of our cultivated grapes.\r\nFrom the accounts of those who have grown it, Ironclad is as free from\r\nmildew and rot, in fruit at least, as any of our cultivated native\r\ngrapes. It is also very resistant to phylloxera and has been used\r\nsomewhat in France and Spain as a resistant stock for Vinifera. It is\r\nalso extremely vigorous and hardy and is very productive. The fruit is\r\nnot of sufficiently high quality nor attractive enough in appearance to\r\nmake a good table grape but it is said to make very excellent wine, the\r\njuice having color and body enough to make it of value for adding color\r\nto lighter colored musts. Ironclad is a very capricious bearer and\r\nespecially so on rampant growing vines, one of the faults of the variety\r\nbeing that it makes too rank a growth.\r\n\r\nThe history of this grape, as given by A. W. Pearson of Vineland, New\r\nJersey, is as follows: In 1873 Pearson secured from Colonel Scott, then\r\npresident of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, cuttings of a vine\r\ngrowing on the latter's grounds, near Darby about seven miles west of\r\nPhiladelphia. Scott's gardener reported the vine to be free from rot and\r\nPearson, who had named the variety Scott, changed the name to Ironclad\r\nwhen he found the gardener's report as to rot verified. On investigation\r\nPearson found that the variety was over two hundred years old, and that\r\nit had been cultivated locally under the name of Ash, from a former\r\nowner of the Scott place and an ancestor of Pearson. This account is not\r\nfully corroborated by early horticultural writers but appears to be\r\nsufficiently accurate to give the variety historical interest. Ironclad\r\nis said to be a hybrid between Labrusca and Riparia and its botanical\r\ncharacters justify such a supposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IRONCLAD]\r\n\r\n     Vine a rank grower, hardy, productive.

In the early days of grape-growing in\r\nthis country Isabella was the grape of the North Atlantic and New\r\nEngland States while the vineyards of the South were planted with\r\nCatawba, the latter requiring too long a season and being too\r\nsusceptible to fungal diseases for a northern grape. Isabella has been\r\nalmost wholly replaced in the North by Concord, because the latter is\r\nearlier, hardier and more productive, and the older variety can now\r\nhardly be found except in the collections of experimenters and amateurs.\r\n\r\nIn appearance Isabella is quite as attractive as any of the black\r\ngrapes, having large, well-formed clusters and a deep black color with\r\nthick bloom. The flavor is good but the thick skin and muskiness in\r\ntaste are objectionable. The fruit keeps and ships well and seldom\r\nrattles or cracks but the variety is surpassed in vine characters by\r\nmany other standard kinds, notably Concord, which, as stated above, has\r\ntaken its place. The lustrous green, ample foliage which remains late in\r\nthe season, and the vigor of Isabella, make it an attractive ornamental,\r\nwell adapted for growing on arbors, porches and trellises. Individual\r\nvines of this variety growing in New York, the Middle States, and New\r\nEngland, realize more than any other grape that ideal of peace and\r\nplenty for which the grape has been the symbol since the vines of Judah\r\nand of Israel. While it is of small commercial importance, Isabella is\r\nstill worthy a place in the garden and as an ornamental.\r\n\r\nThe origin of Isabella is not certainly known. It was secured by William\r\nPrince of Flushing, Long Island, from Mrs. Isabella Gibbs, the wife of\r\nGeo. Gibbs, a merchant then living in Brooklyn, New York. Prince states\r\nthat he first saw this grape in 1816 and was so struck with its\r\nappearance that he considered it worthy of a name and introduction to\r\nthe public. It was consequently named in honor of Mrs. Gibbs and\r\nintroduced shortly after 1816. In answer to a request from Prince as to\r\nthe place of its origin, Mrs. Gibbs reported that it had come originally\r\nfrom the vicinity of Dorchester, South Carolina. This account of its\r\norigin was published at the time in several agricultural periodicals and\r\nlater in Prince's _Treatise on the Vine_. The whole question was\r\nthoroughly discussed in the agricultural press of that day but without\r\na satisfactory solution of the place of its nativity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ISABELLA]\r\n\r\nNicholas Herbemont[194] who sought the history of the variety in the\r\nneighborhood of Dorchester, South Carolina, doubted its having\r\noriginated there, as he found it known only as a cultivated sort with a\r\ntradition of its having been introduced years before by a gentleman then\r\ndead. There were various accounts published of its having originated in\r\nNorth Carolina, Virginia, Delaware and Europe, none of which are worthy\r\nof any credence. All that can be said is that it originated some time in\r\nthe eighteenth century, probably in one of the Carolinas and that it was\r\ncultivated in many widely separated neighborhoods prior to 1800.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 Isabella was placed on the grape list of the American\r\nPomological Society fruit catalog, for general cultivation. In 1864, on\r\naccount of its susceptibility to mildew it was transferred to a list for\r\ncultivation in special localities. It was soon, however, restored to the\r\noriginal list where it still remains. After the introduction of Concord,\r\nas noted above, the popularity of Isabella waned but it is still to be\r\nfound in many sections as one of the less planted of the market sorts\r\nand is in practically all varietal vineyards. It was introduced into\r\nEurope before 1830 where it was quite extensively cultivated for the\r\nmanufacture of a low grade wine, and it is quite probable that the\r\nphylloxera, which later became such a pest, was introduced on roots of\r\nthe Isabella.\r\n\r\nIsabella is generally classed as a pure Labrusca but there are many who\r\nthink there is a strain of Vinifera present. This is indicated by the\r\nshape of the berries, certain characters of the seeds, the\r\nsusceptibility of the vine to mildew and of the fruit to black-rot. The\r\ncharacters of Isabella can be traced in a great number of offspring\r\nthough comparatively few of them have outlived the parent in usefulness.\r\nPure-bred progeny of the Isabella differ but little from the parent and\r\nare classed as strains of the original rather than as new varieties.\r\nHybrids of it with pure Vinifera are usually worthless, lacking in vigor\r\nand hardiness, and so much more so than in the case of hybrids of\r\nVinifera and known pure American grapes as to further suggest Vinifera\r\nblood in Isabella. Such hybrids, too, usually bear a stronger\r\nresemblance to the Old World grape than offspring of pure-bred parents\r\nof the two species.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to medium, usually hardy, variable in productiveness,\r\n     but sometimes producing heavy crops, somewhat subject to mildew in\r\n     certain locations. Canes short to above medium, numerous, covered\r\n     with heavy pubescence, thick, light to dark brown; nodes enlarged,\r\n     strongly flattened; internodes short to medium; diaphragm thick;\r\n     pith intermediate to below in size; shoots covered with heavy\r\n     pubescence; tendrils continuous, long, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds small, short, thickish, conical, open very late. Young\r\n     leaves tinged on lower side and along margin of upper side with\r\n     light rose carmine. Leaves intermediate in size, often roundish,\r\n     thick; upper surface dark green, smooth to medium, glossy; lower\r\n     surface whitish-green, heavily pubescent; veins distinct; lobes\r\n     three when present with terminal lobe obtuse to acute; petiolar\r\n     sinus shallow to medium, narrow, often closed and overlapping;\r\n     basal sinus usually none; lateral sinus shallow, narrow, frequently\r\n     notched; teeth shallow, medium to wide. Flowers usually strongly\r\n     self-fertile, open in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit usually ripens with Catawba or earlier, keeps and ships well.\r\n     Clusters large to medium, intermediate in length, nearly\r\n     cylindrical to conical, frequently single-shouldered, variable in\r\n     compactness; peduncle short to medium, thick; pedicel variable in\r\n     length, slender, almost smooth, much enlarged at point of\r\n     attachment to fruit; brush long, yellowish-green. Berries variable\r\n     in size, medium to large, oval, deep black, color long before ripe,\r\n     covered with considerable blue bloom, usually persistent, soft.\r\n     Skin thick to medium, very tough, adheres considerably to the pulp,\r\n     contains no pigment, astringent. Flesh pale green, sometimes with\r\n     yellowish tinge, translucent, juicy, fine-grained, tender but\r\n     meaty, somewhat stringy, inclined to foxiness, sweet to agreeably\r\n     tart at center, slightly astringent when not mature, ranks good in\r\n     quality.

In fruit characters it greatly resembles its parent but is\r\nmuch earlier, ripening shortly after Moore Early, and has a more compact\r\nbunch. Like its parent, the fruit is of good quality and keeps\r\nremarkably well for so early a grape. It is now grown in New York more\r\nthan Isabella and while not of any considerable commercial importance,\r\nis far more deserving attention as a market grape than some of the\r\npoorly flavored kinds more generally grown.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties under this name. Two are mentioned by\r\nWarder; one of Ohio and one of New York origin. The Isabella Seedling\r\nhere described was originated by G. A. Ensenberger, Sr., of Bloomington,\r\nIllinois, who sent it to this Station for testing in 1889. Full details\r\nof the origin and history of this grape are not known, Mr. Ensenberger\r\nhaving died soon after its dissemination, without leaving a record of\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to very vigorous, usually hardy, healthy, productive.\r\n     Canes long to medium, intermediate in number, thickish, dark brown,\r\n     often with a tinge of red, surface covered with thin bloom;\r\n     tendrils intermittent to continuous, bifid. Leaves healthy, medium\r\n     to large, rather thick; upper surface medium green, dull, of\r\n     average smoothness; lower surface pale green or grayish-green,\r\n     occasionally with tinge of bronze, pubescent; veins distinct.\r\n     Flowers nearly fertile; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens early but later than Moore Early, keeps well. Clusters\r\n     large to medium, long, slender to medium, cylindrical to slightly\r\n     tapering, usually single-shouldered, loose to medium but more\r\n     compact than Isabella. Berries large to medium, distinctly oval,\r\n     often pear-shaped, dull black, covered with a moderate amount of\r\n     blue bloom, persistent, rather soft. Skin medium to thick,\r\n     intermediate in toughness, contains some red pigment. Flesh pale\r\n     green, juicy, somewhat tender, slightly coarse, vinous, sweet next\r\n     the skin to acid at center, good in quality. Seeds numerous,\r\n     separate rather easily from the pulp, inclined to large, of medium\r\n     length, broad, notched, plump, dark brown; raphe buried in a groove\r\n     of average width; chalaza large, above center, circular to slightly\r\n     oval, somewhat obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nISRAELLA.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera?)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Horticulturist_, =18=:313, 314. 1863. =2.= Grant, _Descript.\r\n     Cat._, =1864=:5, 8, 18, 19, 21, 32. =3.= Grant, _Grape Vines_,\r\n     =1864=:1, 2, 13. =4.= _Mag.

Grant contemporaneously with Iona, and was\r\nheralded far and wide as the earliest good grape in cultivation. For\r\nseveral years after its introduction it was widely tried and almost\r\neverywhere discarded because of the poor quality and unattractive\r\nappearance of the fruit and lack of vigor, hardiness and productiveness\r\nof the vine.\r\n\r\nDr. Grant grew the Israella from seed of Isabella planted in 1855. In\r\n1859 or 1860, Peter B. Mead, then editor of the _Horticulturist_,\r\nselected this variety from several thousand seedlings of the same\r\nparentage and named it in honor of Dr. Grant's wife. The first fruit was\r\nborne in 1859. It was placed on the grape list of the American\r\nPomological Society fruit catalog in 1867 and was dropped from their\r\nlist in 1881. It has been gradually dropped from cultivation although it\r\nis still to be found in many varietal vineyards and is listed for sale\r\nby an occasional nurseryman.\r\n\r\n     Vine intermediate in vigor, usually hardy, hardly productive. Canes\r\n     of average length, not numerous, slender, medium to dark brown;\r\n     tendrils continuous, bifid. Leaves large to medium, intermediate in\r\n     thickness; upper surface light green, dull, medium to rugose; lower\r\n     surface pale green to grayish-green, faintly pubescent. Stamens\r\n     upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens a little later than Concord, appears to keep well.\r\n     Clusters above average size, intermediate in length and breadth,\r\n     strongly tapering, often single-shouldered, usually compact,\r\n     frequently with many abortive fruits. Berries small to medium,\r\n     roundish to oval, black or purplish-black, not glossy, covered with\r\n     a fair amount of bloom, inclined to drop somewhat from the pedicel,\r\n     not firm. Skin thick, tough, contains a large amount of\r\n     purplish-red pigment. Flesh pale green, juicy, tender, stringy,\r\n     mild, sweet from skin to center, appears to lack character, not so\r\n     good in flavor or quality as Concord, ranks no more than fair in\r\n     quality. Seeds separate easily from the pulp, medium to below in\r\n     size, intermediate in length, broad to medium, decidedly notched,\r\n     blunt, light brown, seed-coat often covered with numerous grayish\r\n     warts; raphe buried in a shallow, wide groove; chalaza small, at\r\n     center or above, irregularly circular, obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nIVES.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Aestivalis?)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _U.

It is hardy, healthy, vigorous, and fruitful, but poor in\r\nquality as a table grape, not ranking above Hartford, with which it\r\nsometimes competes in the market though wrongfully, as it is a much\r\nlater grape. Ives colors long before it is ripe and is often sent to\r\nmarket before sufficiently matured, at which stage of development it is\r\nbarely edible. Even when ripe it has a foxy odor objectionable to nearly\r\nall; moreover, its flesh is tough and pulpy. The bunches are compact\r\nwith well-formed, jet-black grapes, which make it an attractive fruit.\r\nIt is easily propagated and is adapted to any good grape soil. It is so\r\nrampant in growth that it is difficult to manage in the vineyard. The\r\ngood characters of the vine, as well as one or two of the fruit,\r\nindicate that Ives might be desirable for breeding purposes, but its\r\nspecial value is for the making of red wines of the claret type, in\r\nwhich it is said to have a fine red color but a foxy taste and odor\r\nwhich, however, improve with age. Ives is hardly as widely grown as\r\nformerly, having been most popular at the time when the Catawba along\r\nthe Ohio River was succumbing to fungal diseases and a more healthy and\r\nproductive grape was wanted. It has never been very largely grown\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nIves was grown by Henry Ives from seed planted in 1840 in his garden in\r\nCincinnati, Ohio. It was exhibited in 1844 before the Cincinnati\r\nHorticultural Society. Ives insisted that it came from seed of Madeira\r\ngrapes which had been sent him from abroad. As the variety is evidently\r\nlargely, if not wholly Labrusca, it has always been supposed that his\r\nMadeira seedlings became accidentally mixed with a chance seedling.\r\nBecause of some of its characters the parentage of Ives has been\r\nvariously credited to Isabella, Alexander, Hartford and others, but\r\nnothing is positively known as to this phase of its origin. It was\r\nplaced on the grape list in the American Pomological Society fruit\r\ncatalog in 1869 where it is still retained. Ives was awarded in 1868 the\r\npremium offered by the Longworth Wine House of Cincinnati for the best\r\nwine grape for the United States. It is still cultivated to a\r\nconsiderable extent although not nearly so popular as forty years ago.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive to very productive. Canes\r\n     long to medium, of average number, thick, dark brown to\r\n     reddish-brown, surface covered with thin blue bloom; nodes\r\n     enlarged, slightly flattened; internodes short; diaphragm thick;\r\n     pith medium to below in size; shoots pubescent; tendrils\r\n     continuous, of average length, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds medium to large, short, thick, obtuse to conical,\r\n     sometimes strongly compressed.

Stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Concord or slightly later, keeps well.\r\n     Clusters of fair size, intermediate in length and breadth, tapering\r\n     to nearly cylindrical, three or four bunches per shoot, frequently\r\n     single-shouldered, compact to medium, often with numerous abortive\r\n     berries; peduncle long to medium, of average thickness; pedicel\r\n     above medium in length, slender, covered with numerous, small\r\n     warts; brush short, slender, pale green with reddish-brown tinge.\r\n     Berries intermediate in size, oval to roundish, jet-black, covered\r\n     with a moderate amount of blue bloom, very persistent, firm.

JAEGER,\r\n     _Hermann_ (6). _Munson No. 81_ (2).\r\n\r\nJaeger is a large-clustered, small-berried grape from Munson of\r\nTexas.[195] It is said to be very successful in the South and Southwest\r\nboth as a table and a wine grape. Its meritorious qualities are\r\nvigorous, productive vines with foliage free from mildew and rot, and\r\nwell-flavored, tender-fleshed berries with thin tough skins. It requires\r\ntoo long a season for maturity for successful cultivation in New York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES]\r\n\r\nMunson grew Jaeger from seed of a selected wild Post-oak vine pollinated\r\nby Herbemont. The seed was planted in 1885 and the variety was\r\nintroduced by the originator in 1890. The culture of Jaeger seems to be\r\nslowly spreading.

The accompanying color-plate, while not wholly satisfactory, yet\r\nshows characteristic fruit and foliage somewhat reduced in size. James\r\nis one of the largest of the Rotundifolia grapes and probably the best\r\ngeneral purpose variety of this species. It cannot be grown north of\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\nThe variety was originated by J. Van Lindley of Pitt County, North\r\nCarolina. It was introduced about 1890 and was placed on the grape list\r\nof the American Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1899. It is not\r\nknown in the North but is cultivated more or less throughout the habitat\r\nof _Vitis rotundifolia_ in the South.\r\n\r\nThe following description of the variety is a compilation:\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, healthy, productive. Flowers open very late; stamens\r\n     reflexed. Fruit ripens late, hangs on the vines for three weeks,\r\n     keeps well. Clusters small, containing from four to twelve berries,\r\n     irregular, loose. Berries large, three-fourths to one and\r\n     one-quarter inches in diameter, roundish, black or blue-black.

Moreover, it\r\nripens very early, being one of the first to color though not ripe until\r\nsome time after fully colored; and earliness is another requisite for a\r\nnorthern location. The vine, too, is generally healthy, vigorous and\r\nproductive. But the fruit is worthless where better sorts can be grown.\r\nThe clusters and berries are small, or of only medium size, while the\r\ngrapes are pulpy, tough, seedy, with a thick skin and a disagreeable\r\nacid taste. Janesville has so many good vine characters that it may be\r\nof value for breeding purposes. It is fit for cultivation only in\r\nnorthern localities where better grapes cannot be grown or where fruit\r\nfor a cheap red wine is wanted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JANESVILLE]\r\n\r\nJanesville was grown by F. W. Loudon, of Janesville, Wisconsin, from\r\nseed secured at the Rock County Fair in 1858. It fruited for the first\r\ntime in 1861 and was introduced several years later by C. H. Greenman of\r\nMilton, Wisconsin, who had bought the variety from the originator for\r\n$1000. It was named by the Wisconsin Horticultural Society in 1868.\r\nJanesville was placed on the grape list in the American Pomological\r\nSociety fruit catalog in 1883 and is still retained. It is said by many\r\nto be a cross of Hartford and Clinton but this is a surmise and nothing\r\nis positively known as to its parentage. Its botanical characters are\r\nplainly those of a Labrusca-Riparia cross but with what admixture of the\r\ntwo species cannot be told. The early blooming season, and sometimes\r\nintermittent tendrils, indicate _Vitis riparia_, while foliage and\r\nfruit show both this species and _Vitis labrusca_.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to very vigorous, healthy, hardy, productive to very\r\n     productive. Canes spiny, intermediate in length, numerous, medium\r\n     to below in size, dark brown; nodes flattened; internodes long to\r\n     medium; diaphragm thick; pith intermediate in size; shoots thinly\r\n     pubescent; tendrils intermittent to continuous, long, bifid to\r\n     trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds medium to below in size, short, thick, conical,\r\n     prominent, open early. Young leaves tinged on under side and\r\n     faintly along margin of upper side with rose carmine. Leaves small\r\n     to medium, somewhat thin; upper surface variable in color, glossy\r\n     and smooth; lower surface pale green, slightly pubescent; veins\r\n     indistinct; leaf usually not lobed with terminus acute; petiolar\r\n     sinus intermediate in depth, narrow, often closed and overlapping;\r\n     basal and lateral sinuses lacking; teeth shallow, of average width.\r\n     Flowers fertile, open very early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens slightly earlier than Concord although it colors much\r\n     earlier, keeps well.

It falls considerably\r\nshort of being an Iona fruit on a Concord vine, however, which would\r\nhave made it one of the most valuable of American grapes. The vine\r\nproduces its fruit two weeks later than Concord and is not nearly as\r\nhardy, faults that debar it from taking high rank as a commercial grape\r\nin New York. In its botanical characters and in immunity from diseases\r\nit is almost identical with Concord. Fortunately the vines yield readily\r\nto \"laying down\" for winter protection so that even in commercial\r\nplantations it is not difficult to cover the vines and so prevent winter\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of Jefferson is handsomer than that of Iona and of almost\r\nequal quality. The accompanying color-plate shows the large,\r\nwell-formed, compact bunch, with berries of uniform size and color,\r\nwhich, taken together, make it one of the most attractive of red grapes.\r\nThe flesh is firm, yet tender and juicy with a rich, vinous flavor and a\r\ndelicate aroma which persists even after the berries have dried into\r\nraisins. The fruit ships and keeps well, the berries adhering to the\r\ncluster and the fruit retaining its freshness into late winter. The vine\r\ncharacters, with the exceptions of late bearing and tenderness to cold,\r\nare in the main good.\r\n\r\nJefferson is widely distributed and is well known by viticulturists in\r\neastern America. It is not particular as to localities, if the season be\r\nlong and the climate temperate, and thrives in nearly all grape soils\r\nthough it does not flourish in a soil strongly impregnated with lime.\r\nThis variety is deserving greater recognition as a commercial grape than\r\nit now receives. In a discriminating market it should command a\r\nsufficiently high price to make it a profitable variety to grow in this\r\nState despite its need of protection. Few grapes, and probably no red\r\ngrape, are more desirable inhabitants of the garden than Jefferson; it\r\nnot only furnishes an abundance of the best long-keeping fruit, but is\r\nalso very ornamental throughout the season.\r\n\r\nThis variety is one of J. H. Ricketts'[196] grapes from seed of\r\nConcord pollinated with Iona. It fruited for the first time in 1874\r\nand was introduced about 1880. In 1881 it was placed on the grape list\r\nof the American Pomological Society fruit catalog and has never been\r\nremoved. Of all the remarkable seedlings raised by Ricketts the\r\nJefferson is best known and most widely disseminated. The variety won\r\nfor its originator the Wilder silver medal and as grown by him seldom\r\nfailed to take premiums at exhibitions where shown. It is greatly to be\r\nregretted that the variety does not have all of the characters requisite\r\nto adapt it to culture in commercial vineyards.\r\n\r\n     Vine normally vigorous, healthy, not always hardy, medium in\r\n     productiveness. Canes short, numerous, about medium in thickness,\r\n     light to dark brown; nodes enlarged, roundish; internodes short;\r\n     diaphragm thick; pith medium to below in size; shoots heavily\r\n     pubescent; tendrils intermittent, medium to short, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds small, short, slender, pointed to conical, open very\r\n     late.

In flavor it is very\r\ngood for so early a variety, being sweet, rich yet sprightly and almost\r\nfree from foxiness. But the fruit lacks in attractiveness and keeping\r\nquality, and shells badly when overripe. The clusters and berries are\r\nsmall, and the color is too green and the cluster too loose for a good\r\ngrape. Jessica may be commended for earliness and hardiness and is\r\ntherefore desirable, if at all, in northern regions.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Read of Port Dalhousie, Ontario, grew Jessica from seed\r\nplanted some time between 1870 and 1880. It was introduced in 1884 by D.\r\nW. Beadle of St. Catharines, Ontario. Jessica has been quite thoroughly\r\ntested in different parts of the United States but has never become\r\npopular and is to be found only in varietal vineyards. The parentage of\r\nthe variety is unknown but it is generally considered to be of mixed\r\nLabrusca and Vinifera blood, the tendrils, foliage, fruit characters and\r\nthe weaknesses of the grape all showing a Vinifera hybrid.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium in vigor, usually healthy, hardy, variable in\r\n     productiveness. Canes medium to long, numerous, thickish,\r\n     moderately dark brown with red tinge changing to ash-gray on some\r\n     canes; tendrils continuous to intermittent, bifid or trifid. Leaves\r\n     small to medium, intermediate in thickness; upper surface medium to\r\n     dark green, glossy, often somewhat rugose; lower surface pale\r\n     green, very pubescent; veins indistinct. Flowers nearly fertile,\r\n     open in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEWELL]\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens among the earliest of the white grapes, keeps only\r\n     fairly well. Clusters medium to small, not long, slender, tapering,\r\n     usually single-shouldered, intermediate in compactness. Berries\r\n     small to medium, roundish, light green, often tinged with yellow,\r\n     covered with thin grayish-white bloom, rather persistent unless\r\n     overripe, moderately soft.

Its strong characters\r\nare earliness and high quality, though as compared with Delaware, its\r\nparent, it is not lacking in vigor, health, or hardiness, the vine\r\ncharacters that contribute most to a desirable variety. For a grape of\r\nthis parentage, it is remarkably free from fungal diseases. In form and\r\nsize of bunch and berry it closely resembles Delaware but is a deep\r\nblack in color. The flesh characters and flavor are much like those of\r\nDelaware, the pulp being tender, yet firm, and the flavor having the\r\nsame rich, sprightly, vinous taste found in the parent, though it can\r\nhardly be said to equal the Delaware in the characters which make high\r\nquality. The seeds are few and small. The skin is thin but tough, and\r\nthe fruit, considering the tenderness of the flesh, ships remarkably\r\nwell. It keeps long and does not shell, and though an early grape, will\r\nhang until frost if the robins, one of the worst pests of the\r\ngrape-grower, can be kept from them.\r\n\r\nJewel is a most excellent little grape, almost worthy the place among\r\nblack grapes that Delaware has among red ones. In particular it is\r\nrecommended for its earliness and for those localities to the North\r\nwhere standard varieties, as Concord, do not ripen. Our list of early\r\ngrapes is large, but most of them are poor in quality, while Jewel is\r\ndeserving in this respect to stand well toward the head of the list.\r\n\r\nJohn Burr of Leavenworth, Kansas, grew Jewel from seed of Delaware\r\nplanted about 1874. The blossoms being open to cross-pollination, the\r\nmale parent is unknown. It was introduced in 1887 by Stayman & Black of\r\nLeavenworth. Jewel has been quite widely tested in varietal vineyards\r\nbut has never become popular and in the East, in particular, is hardly\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, healthy, hardy except in exposed\r\n     locations, medium to productive. Canes intermediate in length and\r\n     number, slender, light to dark reddish-brown; nodes enlarged,\r\n     flattened; internodes medium to short; diaphragm thickish; pith\r\n     medium to below in size; shoots thinly pubescent; tendrils\r\n     continuous, of average length, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds of medium size, short, thick, conical, open early. Young\r\n     leaves heavily tinged on under side and along margin of upper side\r\n     with rose-carmine. Leaves scant, intermediate in size, thick; upper\r\n     surface light green, dull, medium to rugose; lower surface tinged\r\n     with bronze, heavily pubescent; veins well defined; lobes three\r\n     when present, with terminus acute; petiolar sinus of average depth,\r\n     narrow to medium; basal sinus usually lacking; lateral sinus\r\n     shallow, wide; teeth shallow, of ordinary width. Flowers sterile,\r\n     open in mid-season or somewhat earlier; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Moore Early, keeps and ships well. Clusters\r\n     medium to small, slender to medium, tapering to cylindrical,\r\n     single-shouldered, medium to compact; peduncle inferior in length,\r\n     of average size; pedicel short to medium, slender; brush short,\r\n     wine-colored. Berries medium in size, roundish to oval, dark\r\n     purplish-black, dull, covered with heavy, blue bloom, persistent,\r\n     moderately firm. Skin inclined to thin, tough, adheres to the pulp,\r\n     contains dark, wine-colored pigment, not astringent. Flesh pale\r\n     green, translucent, juicy, fine-grained, usually tender, sprightly,\r\n     vinous, sweet from skin to center, not foxy, good to very good in\r\n     quality. Seeds do not separate readily from the pulp, one to four,\r\n     average two, intermediate in size and breadth, frequently\r\n     one-sided, blunt, light brown; raphe hidden in a deep groove;\r\n     chalaza small, above center, circular to oval, distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nKENSINGTON.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Riparia, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Can.

The grape is a handsome yellowish-green\r\nwith large oval berries in a somewhat loose cluster of medium size. As\r\nit grows on the grounds of this Station, the clusters contain many\r\nundeveloped berries and are not as uniform in size and shape as might be\r\ndesirable. While the quality is not equal to that of Buckland\r\nSweetwater, it is much better than Clinton, ranking among good to best\r\ngrapes. The flesh is tender and juicy, though slightly stringy, with a\r\nrich, sweet, vinous flavor. The seeds are markedly those of Vinifera.\r\nThe hardiness of the vine and the high quality of the fruit should make\r\nKensington a favorite green grape in northern gardens. It is doubtful if\r\nits good characters are sufficient in number or degree to make it of\r\nvalue for commercial vineyards.\r\n\r\nThis variety was produced by William Saunders of London, Ontario, from\r\nseed of Clinton pollinated by Buckland Sweetwater. It was sent out for\r\ntesting sometime between 1870 and 1880 and since that time has been\r\ncarefully tried at the Canadian Experiment Station and this Station, and\r\nwith very favorable results. For some reason it seems not to have been\r\nvery generally introduced into cultivation and nurserymen scarcely\r\nhandle it though it ought to be found in gardens and in northern\r\nvineyards at least.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, usually productive but sometimes an uncertain\r\n     bearer, somewhat susceptible to attacks of mildew and leaf-hoppers.\r\n     Canes medium to long, of average number, somewhat slender, light\r\n     brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes short to medium;\r\n     diaphragm intermediate in thickness; pith of medium size; shoots\r\n     thinly pubescent; tendrils persistent, intermittent to continuous,\r\n     rather long, bifid to sometimes trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds medium to below in size, variable in length, slender,\r\n     conical to pointed, open very late. Young leaves tinged with faint\r\n     rose-carmine on lower side only; upper side heavily pubescent,\r\n     prevailing color pale green with faintest trace of carmine. Leaves\r\n     small to medium, thin; upper surface light green, glossy, smooth to\r\n     medium; lower surface pale green, pubescent, somewhat hairy; lobes\r\n     none to three with terminus obtuse to acute; petiolar sinus of\r\n     average depth, moderately narrow; basal sinus shallow when present;\r\n     lateral sinus shallow, usually a notch; teeth deep and wide.\r\n     Flowers strongly self-fertile, open medium early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Concord, does not keep very long in good\r\n     condition.

The following was the estimate of it made at that time:\r\n\r\n\"The King is more vigorous and prolific than the Concord, time of\r\nripening and length of season the same, clusters are one-fourth larger,\r\ngrapes are more persistent in pedicels, pulp is more tender, flavor\r\nnearly the same, but more sprightly, seeds fewer in number, wood harder\r\nand of shorter joints and the pedicels are larger.\"\r\n\r\nThis variety was found growing in the Concord vineyard of W. K. Munson,\r\nGrand Rapids, Michigan, in 1892. The vine was set for a Concord, and is\r\neither a bud-sport of that variety or is some other sort that became\r\naccidentally mixed with the Concord vines. Mr. Munson believes it to be\r\nthe former. King is thought by some to be Eaton on account of its close\r\nresemblance to that variety but the grape-growers who have examined it,\r\ngenerally hold it to be distinct. It is in all respects a typical black\r\noffspring of Concord, whether superior remains to be determined. It has\r\nbeen widely disseminated and its place in viticulture should soon be\r\nknown. In seeking the origin of the grapes described in this work, an\r\neffort has been made to determine whether any could be said with\r\ncertainty to have arisen from bud-sports. King is the best authenticated\r\nbud-sport among the grapes here listed and yet there is, as the above\r\nhistory shows, some doubt as to its having originated in this way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADY]\r\n\r\nThe description of King given below was made from vines and fruit from\r\nEllwanger & Barry's vineyards, Rochester, New York.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to very vigorous, hardy, productive.

It is not, however, without faults, one of which, a thin, tender\r\nskin which cracks badly, wholly debars it from ever making a commercial\r\nvariety for other than nearby markets. The vine is much like that of\r\nConcord, though not as vigorous nor as productive, but ripening its\r\nfruit fully two weeks earlier. The fruit is much superior to Concord in\r\nquality, being richer, sweeter, and having less foxiness. It hangs on\r\nthe vines well but deteriorates rapidly after picking. The term\r\n\"ironclad\" used by grape-growers to express hardiness and freedom from\r\ndiseases, is probably as applicable to Lady as to any other of our\r\nLabrusca grapes. The foliage is dense and of a deep glossy green color,\r\nneither scalding under a hot sun, nor freezing until heavy frosts,\r\nmaking it an attractive ornament in the garden. It is deservedly popular\r\nas an amateur grape and should be planted more for nearby markets. It\r\nmay be expected to succeed wherever Concord is grown, and because of its\r\nearly ripening is especially adapted to northern latitudes where Concord\r\ndoes not always mature. Though it ripens early it starts its buds late\r\nand blossoms late, thereby often escaping late spring frosts.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady was first heard of, it was in the hands of a Mr. Imlay of\r\nMuskingum County, Ohio. He had received it as a premium from an\r\nagricultural paper with others, all represented to be pure Concord\r\nseedlings. This was during the Civil War. Later the variety was sold to\r\nGeorge W. Campbell of Delaware, Ohio, who introduced it in 1874. Lady\r\nwas placed on the grape list of the American Pomological Society fruit\r\ncatalog in 1881 where it is still retained. The Lady is another example\r\nof a green seedling of Concord which excels its parent in quality. Among\r\nseveral of such seedlings, this variety is one of the highest in\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n     Vine weak to moderately vigorous, hardy, medium in productiveness,\r\n     healthy. Canes short, medium in number, slender, dark\r\n     reddish-brown; nodes of fair size, flattened; internodes short;\r\n     diaphragm thick; pith intermediate in size; shoots pubescent;\r\n     tendrils intermittent, of average length, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds small, short, pointed to conical. Leaves medium to below\r\n     in size, of average thickness; upper surface light green, glossy,\r\n     medium to somewhat rugose; lower surface pale green; pubescent;\r\n     veins rather indistinct; lobes none to five, with terminal lobe\r\n     acuminate; petiolar sinus shallow to medium, wide; basal sinus of\r\n     average width; lateral sinus variable in depth and width; teeth\r\n     medium to shallow, intermediate in width. Flowers fertile, open in\r\n     mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens with Winchell, does not keep well. Clusters not\r\n     uniform, small to above medium, short, slender, cylindrical,\r\n     sometimes single-shouldered, compact to straggling; peduncle medium\r\n     to short, of average size; pedicel intermediate in length, thick\r\n     and smooth, wide at point of attachment to fruit; brush slender,\r\n     long, greenish-white.

The fruit makes an excellent appearance, keeps well\r\nand ships well, and is fairly tender, juicy and sweet, with a delicate\r\naroma. The vine is very luxuriant,--too much so,--hardy for a grape with\r\nVinifera blood, and healthy, though slightly susceptible to mildew. As\r\nan exhibition grape few green varieties show better when grown with all\r\npossible care and in a favorable location, for the variety is somewhat\r\ncapricious as to soils and locations. It appears to be a desirable\r\nvariety for home use. In the West and Southwest it is said to succeed\r\nbetter than most others of Ricketts' grapes.\r\n\r\nLady Washington is another of J. H. Ricketts' fine seedlings, this\r\nvariety having come from seed of Concord fertilized by Allen's Hybrid.\r\nIt was introduced in 1878, placed on the grape list of the American\r\nPomological Society fruit catalog in 1881, and is still retained there.\r\nThe vine characters of Lady Washington are mostly those of _Vitis\r\nlabrusca_ but the fruit plainly shows the admixture of Vinifera.\r\n\r\n     Vine usually more vigorous than Concord, sometimes sustains winter\r\n     injury, productive, susceptible to mildew. Canes long, few, thick,\r\n     moderately dark brown; nodes greatly enlarged, variable in shape;\r\n     internodes medium to long; diaphragm thick; pith large to medium;\r\n     shoots strongly pubescent; tendrils continuous, long, bifid to\r\n     trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds large to medium, short, thick, open late. Young leaves\r\n     lightly tinged on under side and along margin of upper side with\r\n     light rose-carmine. Leaves medium to large, rather thick; upper\r\n     surface dark green, older leaves strongly rugose, glossy; lower\r\n     surface pale green, strongly pubescent; veins distinct; leaf not\r\n     lobed, with terminus acute; petiolar sinus medium to deep, narrow,\r\n     frequently closed and overlapping; basal sinus usually none;\r\n     lateral sinus shallow, often a mere notch; teeth shallow to medium,\r\n     rather narrow. Flowers fully self-fertile, open in mid-season;\r\n     stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens after mid-season, keeps and ships well. Clusters large\r\n     to medium, broad to medium, irregularly cylindrical,\r\n     single-shouldered to frequently double-shouldered, loose to medium;\r\n     peduncle long, slender to medium; pedicel inclined to short, not\r\n     thick, covered with numerous conspicuous warts, distinctly enlarged\r\n     at point of attachment to fruit; brush very short, greenish.\r\n     Berries variable in size, roundish to oblate, dark green changing\r\n     to yellowish-amber, glossy, covered with thin gray bloom,\r\n     persistent, of medium firmness. Skin thin, tender, adheres\r\n     considerably to the pulp, contains no pigment, not astringent.\r\n     Flesh pale green, transparent, juicy and tender, somewhat stringy,\r\n     aromatic, sweet, ranks above Concord in quality.

This variety has been largely used in France, both as\r\na resistant stock and as a direct producer, but for some years has been\r\nlosing favor for either purpose. It has also been grown more or less in\r\nCalifornia as a resistant stock. It is highly valued for its dark red\r\nwine, is considered a very good table grape, is very resistant to\r\nphylloxera, and withstands drouths well.\r\n\r\nThe origin of Lenoir is unknown. It was in cultivation in the South as\r\nlong ago as the early part of the last century. Nicholas Herbemont[197]\r\nstates in 1829 that its name was given it from a man named Lenoir who\r\ncultivated it near Stateburg, South Carolina, in the vicinity of the\r\nSantee River. There are traditions of its being imported from Europe, of\r\nits being found by Lenoir alongside a hedge, and so on, but none of them\r\nseem in any way authoritative. All that can be said is that Lenoir\r\noriginated probably in one of the Carolinas or Georgia some time in the\r\nEighteenth Century. This variety was tried at an early day in the\r\nnorthern and middle states, by Longworth at Cincinnati, by the Germans\r\nin Missouri, and in other places. On account of its being only\r\nsemi-hardy and somewhat susceptible to rot, its cultivation was soon\r\nabandoned. It was early introduced into Texas and cultivated in the\r\nvicinity of El Paso, from which it derived one of its synonyms. It was\r\nplaced on the grape list of the American Pomological Society fruit\r\ncatalog in 1889 and is still retained. Lenoir differs from Herbemont,\r\nwith which it is often confused, in having wood of a darker color,\r\nlarger and darker leaves and slight differences in the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe following description is taken from various accounts of the variety:\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, thrifty, semi-hardy, usually quite productive. Canes\r\n     rather numerous with some bloom at the nodes; tendrils\r\n     intermittent. Leaves from two to seven-lobed, usually five, and of\r\n     a characteristic bluish-green color above and a more pale green\r\n     below. Clusters quite variable, medium to very large, tapering,\r\n     usually shouldered. Berries small to medium, round, of a dark\r\n     bluish-purple, nearly black, with lilac bloom. Skin rather thick,\r\n     tough. Flesh slightly juicy, tender, subacidly sweet, very rich in\r\n     coloring matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINDLEY.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _U. S. D. A.

By common consent it is the best\r\nof the red grapes originated by Rogers in his crosses between Labrusca\r\nand Vinifera. Unfortunately the color-plate does not do the variety\r\njustice. Both berry and bunch should be shown a little larger, even for\r\naverage-sized specimens.\r\n\r\nWhen well grown Lindley is a very handsome grape. The bunches are of\r\nonly medium size and are somewhat loose but the berries are well-formed,\r\nof uniform size, and of an attractive dark red color. The flesh is firm,\r\nfine-grained, juicy and tender without pulpiness and with a peculiarly\r\nrich aromatic flavor. The skin is thick and rather tough but is not\r\nobjectionable in fully ripe fruit. The fruit keeps well and ships well\r\nand the berries neither crack nor shatter. The vine is vigorous,\r\ncomparatively hardy for a Vinifera hybrid, fairly healthy, but as with\r\nmost of its kind, susceptible to mildew. The chief defects of Lindley\r\nare its self-sterility and precariousness in bearing, and its lack of\r\nadaptation to many soils. Lindley has long been a favorite grape in the\r\ngarden and should continue to be such, and might well be grown in\r\ncommercial plantations as a fancy product.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the origin and parentage of Lindley see \"Rogers'\r\nHybrids.\" _Rogers' No. 9_, or Lindley, is first mentioned separately\r\nfrom the others of Rogers' hybrids about 1862. In 1869 Rogers gave this\r\ngrape the name Lindley in honor of John Lindley, the English botanist.\r\nThe variety has been used by a number of breeders, Munson in particular,\r\nas a parent for improved pure-bred or cross-bred offspring. Lindley was\r\nplaced on the American Pomological Society fruit catalog list in 1867\r\nand has not been removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LINDLEY]\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to rank, usually hardy but sometimes injured in\r\n     exposed locations, not a heavy yielder, somewhat susceptible to\r\n     mildew, often subject to attacks of leaf-hoppers.

Reference number 6 is\r\n     to a red grape. Louisiana is black.)\r\n\r\nThe grape here discussed is of cultural value in the South and is of\r\ninterest from the standpoint of grape-breeding and, historically, to\r\nnorthern grape-growers. Louisiana first came to notice in Missouri. It\r\nwas received about 1860 or before by Frederick Muench of Marthasville,\r\nWarren County, Missouri, from a Mr. Theard of New Orleans, Louisiana,\r\nunder the name White and Red Burgundy. Both supposed varieties proved to\r\nbe alike. Theard informed Muench that the varieties had been imported\r\nfrom France about the first of the century by his (Theard's) father.\r\nThere has been much difference of opinion as to whether this imputed\r\norigin is correct or not. Munson classes it with the Devereaux section\r\nof the Bourquiniana. It is undoubtedly closely related to Herbemont,\r\nLenoir, and others of that class.\r\n\r\nThe variety has been much confused with Rulander and some are of the\r\nopinion that the two varieties are identical. Those who cultivated it\r\nearliest and most extensively were, however, of the opinion that they\r\nwere very similar but distinct. The vine is too tender in the North for\r\ncultivation and there are complaints from some sections in the South of\r\nthe fruit rotting badly.\r\n\r\nThe following description is taken from various sources:\r\n\r\n     Vine very vigorous, stocky, short-jointed; leaves cordate, not\r\n     lobed. Cluster medium to small, shouldered, compact. Berry small,\r\n     round, black with blue bloom, without pulp, juicy, spicy, sweet.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCILE.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _N. Y. Sta.

In vigor, health, hardiness and productiveness it is not\r\nsurpassed by any of the cultivated native grapes. It is probably a\r\nseedling of Wyoming but the vine is much more vigorous than even that\r\nvariety, which is considered a very strong grower. Yet with all of its\r\ngreat growth Lucile ripens its wood almost perfectly. It is very\r\nproductive, as much so as any other of our native grapes, often bearing\r\nfour bunches to the shoot, its crops exceeding those of Concord. It has\r\nnever been known to winterkill in the grape regions of New York and is\r\nprobably as hardy as any other of our Labruscas. Its fruit and foliage\r\nare very nearly immune to the fungal diseases of the grape.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the fruit characters of Lucile are not as desirable as the\r\nvine characters. The size, form, and color of bunches and berries are\r\nall good, making a very attractive fruit, but it has an obnoxious, foxy\r\ntaste and odor objectionable to those who know good grapes though even\r\nin flavor it is better than its supposed parent and is on a par with\r\nsome of the other varieties of its season. A further objection to the\r\nberries is that they are both pulpy and seedy. It is earlier than\r\nConcord, coming about with Worden or preceding it a few days. For so\r\nearly a variety the fruit keeps very well and in spite of its somewhat\r\nthin skin ships very well. It is not at all capricious as to soils,\r\nseemingly thriving in all good grape soils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUCILE]\r\n\r\nLucile may be recommended where an extra hardy grape is desired, for\r\nlocalities where the season is short, and as a variety for breeding\r\npurposes, should it prove capable of transmitting its vine characters,\r\nand for those who do not object to foxiness of taste and aroma in\r\ngrapes.\r\n\r\nJ. A. Putnam of Fredonia, Chautauqua County, New York, is the producer\r\nof Lucile. The vine fruited for the first time in 1890, it being then\r\ntwo years old, and was introduced by Lewis Roesch of Fredonia in 1899.\r\nIt is supposed to be a seedling of Wyoming which it resembles very much\r\nin both fruit and vine characters and surpasses in both. It is a typical\r\nred Labrusca in all of its characters.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, very productive, yielding as good or better\r\n     crops than Concord. Canes medium to long, rather numerous,\r\n     intermediate in thickness, light brown; nodes strongly enlarged,\r\n     usually flattened; internodes medium to short; diaphragm moderately\r\n     thick; pith about medium in size; shoots slightly pubescent;\r\n     tendrils continuous, of average length, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds below medium to small, short, moderately thick, pointed\r\n     to conical, open in mid-season. Young leaves heavily tinged on\r\n     lower side and along margin of upper side with bright carmine.\r\n     Leaves healthy, medium to large, of average thickness, firm; upper\r\n     surface light green, glossy, moderately smooth; lower surface pale\r\n     green or with tinge of bronze, pubescent; veins distinct; leaf\r\n     usually not lobed, with terminus acute; petiolar sinus shallow,\r\n     narrow to medium, sometimes closed and overlapping; basal sinus\r\n     usually absent; lateral sinus a mere notch when present; teeth very\r\n     shallow, of average width. Flowers fertile, open early; stamens\r\n     upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens earlier than Concord or in some seasons about with\r\n     Worden, keeps fairly well. Clusters medium to large, above average\r\n     length, slender, cylindrical to tapering, usually\r\n     single-shouldered, very compact; peduncle intermediate in length,\r\n     large; pedicel short, thick, covered with few, small, inconspicuous\r\n     warts; brush light brown. Berries large to medium, roundish to\r\n     somewhat oval when strongly compacted, dark red, duller than\r\n     Wyoming, covered with thin lilac bloom, persistent, firm. Skin\r\n     medium to thin, somewhat tender, contains a small amount of light\r\n     red pigment and some astringency. Flesh pale green, translucent,\r\n     juicy, rather tough, sometimes stringy, foxy, sweet next the skin\r\n     to slightly tart at center, fair to good in quality, not equal to\r\n     Concord but superior to Wyoming. Seeds separate with difficulty\r\n     from the pulp, one to four, average three, small, broad, short to\r\n     medium, blunt, dark brown; raphe obscure; chalaza intermediate in\r\n     size, slightly above center, oval, distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUTIE.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Gar.

It is vigorous, hardy, healthy, and fruitful, though\r\nscarcely equaling Lucile in any of these characters. Pomologists differ\r\nwidely as to the merits of the fruit, some claiming high qualities for\r\nit and others declaring that it is no better than the average wild\r\nLabrusca. The difference in opinion is partly due to a peculiarity of\r\nthe fruit. If eaten fresh from the vines, the quality, while far from\r\nbeing of the best, is not wholly bad, but after being picked for several\r\ndays it develops so much foxiness of flavor and aroma that it is\r\nscarcely edible. As Lutie grows on the Station grounds its fruit has\r\nlittle merit, though somewhat attractive in appearance, and the variety\r\ncan be recommended only for vigor, hardiness, resistance to disease and\r\nfruitfulness. It is given the prominence of an illustration in _The\r\nGrapes of New York_ out of respect for the opinions of others rather\r\nthan for its merits as it grows here. It makes a better showing in other\r\ngrape regions.\r\n\r\nLutie is a chance seedling found on the grounds of Dr. L. C. Chisholm of\r\nSpring Hill, near Nashville, Davidson County, Tennessee. It was\r\nintroduced in 1885 by Messrs. Coleman, Webber and Newson of Nashville.\r\nLutie was placed on the grape list of the American Pomological Society\r\nfruit catalog in 1899 where it has since been retained. Its gross\r\ncharacters are much the same as those of Dracut Amber, Lucile, Wyoming,\r\nand Woodruff, all typical red Labruscas and worthy of cultivation only\r\nwhere better-flavored varieties cannot be grown.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes short, of average\r\n     number, slender, dark reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, roundish;\r\n     internodes short; diaphragm thin; pith inclined to small; shoots\r\n     pubescent; tendrils continuous, short to medium, bifid.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: LUTIE]\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds small, short to medium, slender, open in mid-season.\r\n     Young leaves tinged on lower side and along margin of upper side\r\n     with bright carmine. Leaves medium to small, of average thickness;\r\n     upper surface dark green, often rugose; lower surface bronze to\r\n     whitish-green, pubescent; veins somewhat distinct; leaf usually not\r\n     lobed, with terminus acute to acuminate; petiolar sinus moderately\r\n     deep, medium to sometimes wide; basal sinus lacking; lateral sinus\r\n     rather shallow and narrow when present; teeth shallow, narrow.\r\n     Flowers fertile, open somewhat early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens earlier than Concord, some seasons about with Worden,\r\n     does not keep nor ship well. Clusters medium to small, short and\r\n     broad, blunt at end, cylindrical to sometimes conical, usually not\r\n     shouldered, compact; peduncle intermediate in length, rather thick;\r\n     pedicel short, of average thickness, covered with small,\r\n     scattering, inconspicuous warts; brush slender, of average length,\r\n     pale green. Berries large to below medium, roundish, light to dark\r\n     red, dull, covered with thin, whitish or lilac bloom, drop badly\r\n     from pedicel, nearly firm. Skin intermediate in thickness somewhat\r\n     tender, adheres to the pulp, contains no pigment, astringent. Flesh\r\n     pale green, translucent, moderately juicy, somewhat tough, strongly\r\n     foxy, sweet next the skin to slightly tart at center, fair to\r\n     possibly good in quality.

The accompanying illustration\r\nshows the size of the berry accurately but the bunch, as shown here, is\r\ntoo small.[198]\r\n\r\nMcPike in vine and fruit characters is very similar to its parent,\r\nWorden, differing in having fewer but larger berries per bunch, grapes\r\nnot as high in flavor, and fewer and smaller seeds. Because of a thin,\r\ntender skin the berries crack somewhat, shell more or less, and the\r\nvines are less productive than those of Worden. The faults just named\r\nseem to debar it pretty effectually from becoming a commercial grape in\r\nNew York and it is not high enough in quality and is lacking in too many\r\nother fruit characters to make it of value for the amateur. It should\r\nbe said, however, that the variety has not been largely tested in New\r\nYork and further experience with it is needed to fully determine its\r\nvalue in this State.\r\n\r\nThis variety was originated by H. G. McPike of Mount Lookout Park,\r\nAlton, Illinois, from seed of Worden planted in 1890. It was introduced\r\nin 1897 by Silas Wilson of Atlantic, Iowa. McPike is a typical black\r\ndescendant of Concord, bearing a strong resemblance in its gross\r\ncharacters to Eaton, Hosford, Chautauqua, King, and its parent, Worden.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to medium, hardy, productive to very productive.\r\n     Canes intermediate in length, number and thickness, dull dark\r\n     reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes very short;\r\n     diaphragm thick to medium; pith large; shoots thinly pubescent;\r\n     tendrils continuous, of average length, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds about average size, short, thick to medium, obtuse to\r\n     conical, compressed. Leaves large, thick; upper surface light\r\n     green, dull, medium to slightly rugose; lower surface grayish-white\r\n     to bronze, heavily pubescent; veins fairly distinct; leaf not\r\n     lobed, with terminus acute to obtuse; petiolar sinus deep to\r\n     medium, rather wide; basal and lateral sinuses lacking; teeth\r\n     intermediate in depth and width. Flowers fertile or nearly so.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Concord or earlier, appears to keep well.\r\n     Clusters variable in size, medium to short, rather broad,\r\n     irregularly tapering with slight tendency to cylindrical, often\r\n     blunt at ends, usually not shouldered, two to three bunches per\r\n     shoot, of average compactness; peduncle medium to above in length,\r\n     thick; pedicel long to medium, thick, quite brittle, nearly smooth;\r\n     brush long, slender, greenish with brown tinge. Berries unusually\r\n     large, roundish, purplish-black to black, covered with blue bloom,\r\n     firm. Skin of medium thickness, variable in toughness, sometimes\r\n     cracks, adheres considerably to the pulp, contains a large amount\r\n     of purplish-red pigment, astringent. Flesh pale green, translucent,\r\n     very juicy, rather tender, stringy, vinous, nearly sweet at skin to\r\n     rather acid at center, fair to good in quality. Seeds moderately\r\n     adherent to the pulp, one to four, average two, medium to below in\r\n     size, short, broad, blunt, rather plump, light brown; raphe buried\r\n     in a wide, shallow groove; chalaza rather large, at center or\r\n     slightly above, somewhat obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNATE.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera?)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mo.

It is remarkable in having for its immediate ancestors five\r\nspecies, Lincecumii, Rupestris, Labrusca, Vinifera, and Bourquiniana. As\r\nManito grows at this Station, its vine characters are all good and the\r\nfruit is passably so. According to the originator, the variety endures\r\nextremes of climate very well and has stood the cold of the New York\r\nwinter and the heat of summer without any perceptible injury. The fruit\r\nis not sufficiently handsome nor of high enough quality to recommend the\r\nvariety highly for this State, but it keeps well, ships well, is said to\r\nmake good wine, and is worthy a trial in experimental vineyards at\r\nleast. A point of merit is earliness, as it ripens just before Moore\r\nEarly.\r\n\r\nThe variety was produced from seed of America pollinated by Brilliant.\r\nThe seed of Manito was planted in 1895 and the variety was introduced by\r\nthe originator in 1899.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, hardy, medium to productive. Canes long,\r\n     rather numerous and thick, dark reddish-brown, surface covered with\r\n     blue bloom, nodes enlarged, often flattened; internodes\r\n     intermediate in length; diaphragm thick; pith large to medium;\r\n     shoots thinly pubescent; tendrils medium to above in length, bifid\r\n     to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds large, of average length, thickish, conical to obtuse,\r\n     open very late.

Flowers semi-fertile,\r\n     open in mid-season or later; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Moore Early, keeps and ships well. Clusters\r\n     large to below medium, often quite long, slender to medium,\r\n     cylindrical, sometimes with enlarged end, usually not shouldered,\r\n     loose; peduncle intermediate in length, slender; pedicel short,\r\n     slender, nearly smooth; brush light green with faint reddish tinge.\r\n     Berries intermediate in size, roundish to slightly oval, dull\r\n     purplish-black, covered with a medium amount of blue bloom,\r\n     persistent, moderately firm.

It is surpassed by Diamond, Lady, Martha, and nearly a\r\nscore of other green grapes.\r\n\r\nThe vine characters here are not satisfactory. It is only moderately\r\nproductive and for some years has been affected with chlorosis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANITO]\r\n\r\nMarie Louise was originated by Theophile Huber of Illinois City,\r\nIllinois, about 1880.

MARION PORT (2, 4).\r\n\r\nMarion is an old variety of unknown parentage but so closely resembling\r\nClinton in both botanical and horticultural characters as to be clearly\r\nof the type of that variety. In many grape regions it is held that this\r\nvariety surpasses Clinton as both a table and a wine grape. The growth\r\nof Marion is vigorous, the vine is hardy but hardly sufficiently\r\nproductive, and is susceptible to mildew and to leaf-hoppers. The fruit\r\nis pleasantly sweet and spicy though not of high enough quality for a\r\ntable grape, but making, according to the following, from a French\r\nauthority, a very good dark red wine.[199]\r\n\r\n\"With regard to intense coloring, without any foxy taste, nothing equals\r\nthe wine made of the Marion grape; one-twentieth part is sufficient to\r\ngive to water even a superior wine color; the somewhat violet shade is\r\neasily transformed into a lively red by adding some acid wine or a very\r\nsmall quantity of tartaric acid.\"\r\n\r\nThe fruit colors early in the season but ripens very late, hanging well\r\non the vines and improving with a light touch of frost. Marion is not\r\nmuch grown in New York as a wine grape, though it might prove of value\r\nbecause of its coloring properties for the making of some wines.\r\n\r\nThis variety was brought to notice by a Mr. Shepherd of Marion, Ohio,\r\nover fifty years ago. It was first known as Black German but this name\r\nwas changed to Marion Port. At about the same time, Nicholas Longworth\r\nreceived a variety resembling the Isabella from Marion, Ohio, probably\r\nalso from Shepherd, which he disseminated under the name Marion. Owing\r\nto the similarity of the names, the two varieties became badly confused.\r\nThe true Marion, which many believed to be identical with York Madeira,\r\nwas soon dropped from cultivation and the Marion Port assumed the name\r\nof Marion. Shepherd did not know where the Marion Port had originated\r\nbut stated that it had come originally from Pennsylvania. It is quite\r\npossible that it is some old variety reintroduced under this name. The\r\nspecies of the variety is usually given as Riparia but as the tendrils\r\nare often continuous, there is evidently an admixture of Labrusca blood.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, usually hardy, medium to productive, susceptible to\r\n     injury from leaf-hoppers. Canes very long, intermediate in number\r\n     and thickness, dark reddish-brown, surface covered with blue bloom;\r\n     nodes slightly enlarged, flattened; internodes very long to medium;\r\n     diaphragm thin; pith of average size; shoots glabrous, younger\r\n     shoots tinged with reddish-purple; tendrils continuous, sometimes\r\n     intermittent, long, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds nearly medium in size and thickness, short, conical,\r\n     often strongly compressed, open early; young leaves tinged on under\r\n     side and along margin of upper side with carmine. Leaves unusually\r\n     large, of average thickness; upper surface dark green, glossy;\r\n     lower surface pale green, somewhat cobwebby to nearly smooth; veins\r\n     well defined; leaf not lobed with terminus acuminate; petiolar\r\n     sinus very deep, narrow, often closed and overlapping; basal and\r\n     lateral sinuses lacking; teeth shallow, rather wide. Flowers\r\n     sterile, open very early; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: MARION]\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens in mid-season, keeps fairly well. Clusters medium to\r\n     below, short and slender, cylindrical to tapering,\r\n     single-shouldered, compact; peduncle short, intermediate in\r\n     thickness; pedicel short, slender, covered with few, inconspicuous\r\n     warts; brush very short, wine-colored.

It is a seedling of Concord and resembles its parent\r\ngreatly, differing from it chiefly in the following particulars: Fruit\r\ngreen, a week or more earlier, bunch and berries smaller, quality far\r\nbetter, being sweeter, more delicate, and with less foxiness and less\r\npulp. About the only difference in the vines is a lighter shade of green\r\nin Martha and less robustness, with blossoms opening a few days earlier\r\nthan Concord. Martha is often sold in the markets as Niagara, though the\r\nresemblance between the two is not strong, the Niagara being larger in\r\nbunch and berry and not as high in quality. One of the defects of\r\nMartha, and the chief cause of its going out of favor, is that it does\r\nnot keep nor ship well. A very good white wine is made from Martha. The\r\nvariety is still being planted in some parts of the South, but is\r\ngenerally abandoned in the North.\r\n\r\nSamuel Miller, then of Calmdale, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, grew\r\nMartha from seed of Concord sent him by E. W. Bull. The variety was\r\nintroduced about 1868 by J. Knox of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. It was\r\nplaced on the American Pomological Society fruit catalog list in 1869\r\nand dropped from that list in 1899.\r\n\r\n     Vine variable in vigor, hardy, intermediate in productiveness,\r\n     somewhat susceptible to attacks of mildew in unfavorable seasons.\r\n     Canes medium to long, of average number and size, rather dark\r\n     reddish-brown, surface covered with thin bloom, slightly roughened;\r\n     tendrils continuous to intermittent, bifid. Leaves large to medium,\r\n     rather thick; upper surface light green, intermediate in\r\n     smoothness; lower surface light bronze, heavily pubescent; veins\r\n     well defined. Flowers self-fertile, open in mid-season; stamens\r\n     upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens somewhat earlier than Concord, does not keep nor ship\r\n     well. Clusters medium in size, often below average length,\r\n     intermediate in width, tapering to cylindrical, usually\r\n     single-shouldered, inclined to be loose. Berries medium in size,\r\n     roundish, light green with tinge of yellow, covered with thin gray\r\n     bloom, persistent, medium in firmness. Skin thin, very tender, does\r\n     not usually crack, adheres considerably to the pulp, contains no\r\n     pigment, with scarcely any astringency. Flesh pale yellowish-green,\r\n     juicy, moderately tough, fine-grained, slightly foxy, sweet at skin\r\n     to somewhat tart at center, mild, good to very good in quality but\r\n     not as good as Lady.

It has the peculiarity\r\nor defect of being at its best before full maturity, and of developing\r\nafter ripening a degree of foxiness which impairs its quality. In shape\r\nand size of berry, and sometimes in bunch, there is a striking\r\nresemblance to Isabella, another suggestion of Vinifera in the latter\r\nsort, but the color is that of Catawba. The texture of the fruit is\r\nespecially good, firm but tender and juicy, while the flavor, as with\r\nall of Rogers' grapes, is rich and sweet, though in the case of\r\nMassasoit, hardly as good as others of these hybrids. The vine is\r\nvigorous, hardy and productive but very subject to mildew and rot.\r\nMassasoit is well worth a place in the home vineyard, and as an early\r\ngrape, of fine quality for the local market.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the early history and parentage of Massasoit the\r\nreader is referred to Rogers' Hybrids. The variety attracted\r\nconsiderable attention even while it was known only as _Rogers' No. 3_\r\nand was placed on the American Pomological Society's list of recommended\r\nsorts as early as 1867. In 1869 it was named by Rogers after Massasoit,\r\nthe Indian chief who was so intimately connected with the early history\r\nof Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to very vigorous, hardy in all but unusually cold\r\n     winters, often very productive, very subject to rot and mildew.\r\n     Canes long, intermediate in number, thick, inclined to dark brown\r\n     with slight reddish tinge; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes\r\n     long to medium; diaphragm of average thickness; pith large; shoots\r\n     thinly pubescent; tendrils continuous, long, trifid to bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds large to medium, long, unusually thick, obtuse to\r\n     conical, heavily coated with brownish pubescence. Young leaves\r\n     tinged on upper and under sides with rose-carmine. Leaves variable\r\n     in size, medium to thin, upper surface light green, dull, smooth\r\n     to medium; lower surface pale green, slightly pubescent; veins well\r\n     defined; lobes three to sometimes obscurely five with terminus\r\n     acute; petiolar sinus deep, narrow to medium; basal sinus shallow,\r\n     narrow, often obscure; teeth very shallow, of average width.\r\n     Flowers sterile, open moderately late; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Delaware, keeps well. Clusters variable in\r\n     size, of medium length, often rather broad, cylindrical to\r\n     tapering, frequently single-shouldered, variable in compactness;\r\n     peduncle short to medium, thick; pedicel of average length, slender\r\n     to medium, covered with few, indistinct warts, enlarged at point of\r\n     attachment to fruit; brush of fair length, pale green.

It is an\r\ninteresting variety historically as being one of the first good green\r\ngrapes and as showing almost unmistakable Vinifera characters, probably\r\nanother example of the fortuitous hybridization which gave us so many\r\nvaluable varieties before artificial hybridization of Vinifera with\r\nnative grapes had been tried.\r\n\r\nIn 1843, a man living in Eagleville, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania,\r\nreceived several bunches of grapes from a friend in Maxatawney, Berks\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania. The seeds of these grapes were planted and the\r\nfollowing spring one seed grew. This was the original vine of what was\r\nlater named Maxatawney. It attracted no more than local attention until\r\nabout 1860 when, through the efforts of Peter Crans of Philadelphia, it\r\nreceived several favorable notices in the horticultural press and\r\ncuttings were disseminated for testing. The man who had originated the\r\nvariety, for fear of being besieged by amateur grape cultivators, never\r\nallowed his name to become known. Maxatawney was placed on the American\r\nPomological Society list of sorts recommended for cultivation in 1862,\r\nbut was dropped in 1897. From the first it has been recognized that\r\nMaxatawney shows Vinifera blood. Some have even gone so far as to say\r\nthat it is a derivative, in part, from Malaga. It does not appear,\r\nhowever, that such preciseness is justified. The vine shows the\r\ncontinuous tendrils and the thick, pubescent leaf of Labrusca. In the\r\nlobing of the leaves, the susceptibility to mildew, the oval berries,\r\nthe vinous flavor, and the appearance of occasional seeds, one can\r\ndetect the characters of Vinifera.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, not always hardy, variable in\r\n     productiveness. Canes medium to above in length, of average number,\r\n     slender to medium; tendrils continuous, bifid. Leaves medium to\r\n     large, dark green, thick; lower surface grayish-white with tinge of\r\n     bronze, heavily pubescent. Flowers sterile or nearly so, some\r\n     blossoms imperfectly self-fertile, open in mid-season; stamens\r\n     upright. Fruit ripens after Concord, in some seasons fully as late\r\n     as Catawba, keeps fairly well. Clusters small to above medium,\r\n     often short and slender, cylindrical, occasionally with a small\r\n     single shoulder, rather open to fairly compact. Berries variable in\r\n     size, oval, not uniform in color, pale red or dull greenish with\r\n     amber tinge, covered with thin gray bloom, persistent. Skin medium\r\n     in thickness, often very tough, astringent. Flesh slightly tender,\r\n     foxy, sweet at skin to tart at center, good to very good in\r\n     quality.

The attributes of\r\nMerrimac are so nearly those given for the several others of these\r\ngrapes hitherto described, that there need be no general discussion of\r\nit here other than to state its chief points of difference. It is\r\nstronger in growth, slightly more productive, possibly hardier, and more\r\nexempt from fungal diseases than the average of Rogers' hybrids. Its\r\nseason is about that of Concord, a little earlier than that of most of\r\nits kindred hybrids. It is not as high in quality, and its flesh, skin\r\nand seed characters are such that it is not as pleasant to eat as the\r\nblack varieties named above. Merrimac is worthy a place in collections\r\nand in the gardens for the sake of variety.\r\n\r\nFor a full account of the parentage and details of the origin of the\r\nvariety see \"Rogers' Hybrids.\" Merrimac was first known as No. 19, and\r\nwas considered by those to whom Rogers sent his grapes of peculiar\r\nexcellence, and was granted a premium by the Essex Agricultural Society\r\nin 1859. In 1867, Merrimac, with five others of Rogers' numbered\r\nvarieties, was placed on the grape list of the American Pomological\r\nSociety fruit catalog, where it is still retained. In 1869, Rogers gave\r\nthis variety the name Merrimac after the historic New England river.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, usually hardy but subject to injury in severe\r\n     seasons, moderately productive to productive.

It is chiefly from this fact\r\nthat viticulturists are so diverse in their opinions of it, some\r\nclaiming that it is among our best grapes and others pronouncing it\r\nalmost worthless. Mills grown in the vineyards of this Station is one of\r\nthe half dozen best out of 270 varieties in its fruit characters. The\r\nbunches and berries are large and well-formed, the berries being a\r\nhandsome black with bluish bloom and adhering so firmly to the stem that\r\nthe fruit may be left until April without shelling. The berries are firm\r\nand solid, with the skin adherent to the pulp almost as in the\r\nViniferas, and with the same texture of flesh as in Black Hamburg. The\r\nflesh, despite the solidity, is juicy and parts readily from the seeds.\r\nIts flavor is rich, sweet, vinous, with a trace of muskiness. The grapes\r\nare hardly surpassed in keeping quality and seldom if ever crack or\r\nshatter. The season is a little earlier than Concord.\r\n\r\nBut when we have described its fruit characters, practically all that\r\ncan be is said in its favor. The vines are of only medium vigor, are not\r\nhardy, are fruitful only under the most favorable conditions, and are\r\nvery subject to mildew. In New York neither wood nor roots ripen well in\r\nthe average season and the variety is a most difficult one for\r\nnurserymen to handle. That it succeeds only on certain soils is known\r\nbut data are not at hand to determine what conditions of soil suit it\r\nbest. The soil on which the vines of this Station are growing is a\r\nrather heavy, rich clay and Mills makes a very fair growth here. The\r\nvariety is of doubtful commercial value, unless it be for a special\r\nmarket, but for the garden or the amateur viticulturist it is\r\nundoubtedly one of the best if adapted to the soil and location. It is\r\npossible that the commercial grower may be able to graft it to advantage\r\non some variety with better vine characters.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Mills of Hamilton, Ontario, produced the Mills grape about\r\n1870 from seed of Muscat Hamburg fertilized by Creveling. It was not\r\nintroduced to the public, however, until 1888, when it was offered for\r\nsale by Ellwanger & Barry of Rochester, New York. Mills was placed on\r\nthe grape list of the American Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1897\r\nbut was dropped from the list two years later. The variety has been\r\nwidely tested but as yet has not become of commercial importance in any\r\nof the grape regions of the country.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to above in vigor, not hardy, productive unless injured\r\n     by the winter, somewhat subject to mildew. Canes long, of medium\r\n     size, rather thick, light brown; nodes slightly enlarged and\r\n     flattened, internodes medium to large; diaphragm rather thick; pith\r\n     quite large; shoots slightly pubescent; tendrils intermittent, of\r\n     average length, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds small to medium, short, somewhat slender, conical to\r\n     pointed, open very late.

It is only in the long seasons\r\nand under the sunny skies of the South that the varieties of this group\r\nof Riparias are well grown. As one of these grapes, Missouri Riesling is\r\nnot adapted to New York; as it grows here it is not of high quality and\r\ndoes not mature. The variety is illustrated and described not because of\r\nintrinsic value in this region but as of interest as representing a\r\nsomewhat distinct and important group of native grapes. It is a\r\nbeautiful fruit when well grown and has many good qualities as a wine\r\ngrape, and should it prove adapted to some favored nook or corner of the\r\nState, its culture would probably prove profitable.\r\n\r\nMissouri Riesling was originated by Nicholas Grein about 1870, probably\r\nfrom seed of Taylor. Grein planted seeds of the European Riesling and of\r\nTaylor at the same time and he always supposed that none of the Taylor\r\nseeds grew and that the Missouri Riesling was a seedling of the Riesling\r\nof Germany. Since the Missouri Riesling is evidently of Riparia-Labrusca\r\nlineage and shows no Vinifera whatever, it is to be presumed that\r\nGrein's labels were confused. It was placed on the grape list of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1889 and is still retained\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n     Vine variable in vigor, usually hardy, medium to productive. Canes\r\n     very long, numerous, thick, dark brown; nodes enlarged, not\r\n     flattened; internodes long; diaphragm below average thickness;\r\n     pith medium to above in size; shoots pubescent; tendrils\r\n     continuous, long, trifid to bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds medium in size, short, thick, obtuse to conical, open in\r\n     mid-season. Young leaves slightly tinged on under side only with\r\n     faint brownish-carmine. Leaves large, thick to medium; upper\r\n     surface dark green, glossy, nearly smooth; lower surface pale\r\n     green, thinly pubescent; veins distinct; lobes usually five with\r\n     terminal lobe acuminate; petiolar sinus deep, narrow to medium;\r\n     basal sinus shallow and wide; lateral sinus deep, above average\r\n     width; teeth deep to medium, wide. Flowers fertile to semi-fertile,\r\n     open in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit usually ripens later than Concord and a little before\r\n     Catawba, does not keep nor ship well. Clusters variable in size,\r\n     medium to short, of average width, sometimes cylindrical,\r\n     frequently single-shouldered, variable in compactness; peduncle\r\n     medium to long, slender; pedicel above average length, covered with\r\n     few small warts; brush green with tinge of yellow. Berries\r\n     intermediate in size, roundish to oval, pale or yellowish-green\r\n     changing to light red or with tinge of pink when fully ripe, not\r\n     glossy, covered with thin gray bloom, persistent, firm.

The variety has been\r\nlargely grown in Missouri and the Southwest as a claret wine grape but\r\nis almost unknown in New York and the East. Montefiore is reported as\r\nsucceeding in the Lake District of Ohio and, with the exception that it\r\nis somewhat uncertain in bearing and not always productive on the\r\ngrounds of this Station, it has grown well in this section of New York.\r\nWhile Montefiore is essentially a wine grape, yet it is pleasing in\r\ntaste and texture of fruit and is far better in quality than many of the\r\ncoarser Labruscas so commonly cultivated. It keeps and ships well and\r\npresents an attractive appearance as a table grape.

It comes in season from\r\ntwo to three weeks earlier than Concord and the last fruits of it are\r\nsent to market before those of the later grape are picked. The vines are\r\nreadily recognizable from those of Concord, differing chiefly in being\r\nless productive and more precarious bearers. To grow the variety\r\nsatisfactorily the soil must be rich, well drained and loose, must be\r\nfrequently cultivated and the vines should be carefully pruned and cared\r\nfor in every way. The bunches of Moore Early are not as large as those\r\nof Concord and are more inclined to looseness, and the berries sometimes\r\nshell rather badly. The berries are larger and, as with Concord, crack\r\nunder unfavorable conditions. The flesh characters and the flavor are\r\nessentially those of Concord, though the quality, representing all of\r\nthe characters which make a fruit pleasant to the palate, is not as high\r\nas in the older variety; it is however much higher than that of Champion\r\nand Hartford, its chief competitors in this State and varieties which it\r\nshould replace. Moore Early is by no means an ideal grape for its season\r\nbut until something better is introduced it will probably remain the\r\nbest early commercial grape for New York.\r\n\r\nCaptain John B. Moore of Concord, Massachusetts, is said to have\r\noriginated this variety from seed of Concord. In 1871 it was exhibited\r\nbefore the Massachusetts Horticultural Society with fifty other\r\nseedlings of the same parentage. It was awarded a first class\r\ncertificate of merit by this Society in 1877, and was introduced by the\r\noriginator the same year. In 1881 Moore Early was placed on the grape\r\nlist of the American Pomological Society fruit catalog where it still\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, hardy, not a heavy yielder. Canes medium\r\n     to short, of average number, medium to below in thickness, rather\r\n     dark reddish-brown, surface slightly roughened; nodes enlarged,\r\n     flattened; internodes short to medium; diaphragm thinnish; pith\r\n     intermediate in size; shoots pubescent; tendrils continuous, of\r\n     fair length, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds small and slender, short, pointed to conical, open medium\r\n     early. Young leaves tinged on lower side and along margin of upper\r\n     side with rose-carmine. Leaves large to medium, thick; upper\r\n     surface medium dark green, dull, of average smoothness; lower\r\n     surface tinged with bronze, heavily pubescent; veins distinct; leaf\r\n     usually not lobed, with terminus acute; petiolar sinus of average\r\n     depth, wide to medium; basal sinus lacking; lateral sinus a notch\r\n     when present; teeth shallow, narrow to medium. Flowers fertile,\r\n     open in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens from two to three weeks earlier than Concord, does not\r\n     keep well.

It has\r\nall of the faults of Delaware and some added ones. Were it not for the\r\nfact that the variety is from one to two weeks earlier than its parent,\r\nand somewhat hardier, hence better adapted for colder regions, it could\r\nnot have received the recognition given it by viticulturists. As\r\ncompared with Delaware, it is hardly as vigorous and is less productive.\r\nIt is reputed to be more free from rot and mildew, the latter\r\nespecially. The bunches are much like those of Delaware but with the\r\nfault of setting fruit imperfectly oftentimes even when\r\ncross-pollination is insured. The berries are a little larger but of\r\nmuch the same color and of like flavor, rich, sweet, and with pure\r\nvinousness without a trace of foxiness but withal not of so high quality\r\nas Delaware. The fruit keeps well, ships well, and does not crack nor\r\nshell in New York. Moyer is well established in Canada, where it\r\noriginated, and is highly thought of, proving perfectly hardy wherever\r\nthe Concord is grown and possibly standing even more cold. Its place is\r\nas an early Delaware for northern regions.\r\n\r\nW. H. Read of Port Dalhousie, Lincoln County, Ontario, raised the\r\noriginal vine of Moyer about 1880, from seed of Delaware fertilized by\r\nMiller's Burgundy. It was named after Allan Moyer of St. Catharines,\r\nOntario, who introduced the variety in 1888. Moyer was placed on the\r\ngrape list of the American Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1899.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to medium, hardy, healthy, not productive. Canes\r\n     intermediate in length, numerous, medium to slender, rather dull\r\n     dark reddish-brown; nodes slightly enlarged, flattened; internodes\r\n     short to medium; diaphragm thin; pith medium to below in size;\r\n     shoots pubescent; tendrils continuous, medium to rather long, bifid\r\n     to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds of about average size and thickness, short, conical to\r\n     rather obtuse, open very late. Young leaves tinged on under side\r\n     and along margin of upper side with rose-carmine. Leaves small to\r\n     medium, of average thickness; upper surface dark green, dull and\r\n     smooth; lower surface very pale green or with faint blue tinge,\r\n     heavily pubescent; lobes two to five with terminus acute; petiolar\r\n     sinus shallow to medium, not narrow; basal sinus usually lacking,\r\n     but shallow when present; lateral sinus shallow, narrow; teeth very\r\n     shallow, medium to narrow. Flowers sterile, open early; stamens\r\n     reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens from one to two weeks earlier than Delaware, keeps\r\n     well but loses its color if kept too long. Clusters medium to\r\n     small, short and slender, irregularly tapering, sometimes\r\n     single-shouldered, medium in compactness; peduncle intermediate in\r\n     length, somewhat slender; pedicel inclined to short, of average\r\n     thickness, covered with very small warts; brush yellowish-green.\r\n     Berries medium to small, oblate, dark red covered with dark lilac\r\n     to faint blue bloom, persistent, rather firm. Skin intermediate in\r\n     thickness, not tender, does not adhere to the pulp, astringent.\r\n     Flesh light green, translucent, juicy, rather tender, fine-grained,\r\n     somewhat vinous, good to very good. Seeds separate easily from the\r\n     pulp, one to four, average two or three, intermediate in size,\r\n     broad, short, very blunt, brown with yellow tinge at tips; raphe\r\n     obscure; chalaza of fair size, slightly above center, irregularly\r\n     circular, obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSCAT HAMBURG.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Gar.

It is described below in detail that grape-breeders\r\nmay detect any of its characters transmitted to its offspring. The\r\ngrapes and vines described here were grown under glass, as the variety\r\ncannot be grown out of doors in eastern America.\r\n\r\nMuscat Hamburg is a forcing grape only and is apparently unknown in the\r\ngrape-growing districts of Europe. It is said to grow better grafted on\r\nBlack Hamburg than on its own roots.\r\n\r\nSeward Snow of Wrest Park, Bedfordshire, England, originated Muscat\r\nHamburg more than a half century ago from seed of Black Hamburg\r\nfertilized by White Muscat of Alexandria. It was placed on the grape\r\nlist of the American Pomological Society fruit catalog for 1862 as an\r\nexotic recommended for growing under glass.\r\n\r\n     Vine very vigorous, tender, productive. Canes long, numerous,\r\n     slender to medium, light brown, slightly darker at nodes which are\r\n     enlarged and somewhat flattened; internodes short to medium;\r\n     diaphragm thick; pith nearly large; shoots glabrous; tendrils\r\n     inclined to dehisce early, intermittent or frequently with only one\r\n     tendril present with vacancy on either side, long, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds large, long to medium, inclined to thick. Leaves medium\r\n     to large, intermediate in thickness; upper surface light green,\r\n     dull, somewhat smooth; lower surface slightly lighter green than\r\n     upper surface, faintly pubescent, densely hairy; lobes usually five\r\n     with terminus acute to acuminate; petiolar sinus of average depth,\r\n     medium to narrow, rarely closed or overlapping; basal sinus\r\n     intermediate in depth; lateral sinus deep; teeth very irregular in\r\n     depth and width, some teeth approaching a tendency to lobing.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: MUSCAT HAMBURG (Reduced Size)]\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens the latter part of October under glass, keeps\r\n     unusually well. Clusters very large to medium, long, broad,\r\n     tapering, frequently single-shouldered but sometimes\r\n     double-shouldered, rather loose; peduncle intermediate in length,\r\n     medium to rather thick; pedicel of average length and thickness,\r\n     very much enlarged at point of attachment to fruit. Berries large\r\n     to below medium, oval, dark red, rather dull, covered with lilac\r\n     bloom, very persistent, of average firmness. Skin medium to thick,\r\n     adheres strongly to the pulp, contains no pigment, not astringent.\r\n     Flesh pale green, translucent, very juicy, fine-grained, tender,\r\n     vinous, sweet, very good to best in quality. Seeds separate easily\r\n     from the pulp, one to four, average two, large to medium, long and\r\n     broad, sharply pointed, brownish; raphe hidden in a shallow, broad\r\n     groove; chalaza intermediate in size, decidedly above center,\r\n     pear-shaped, distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAOMI.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Riparia, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Gar.

But\r\nviticulturists have never agreed with the producer of Naomi in his\r\nestimate of it and the variety is now scarcely known. So far as New York\r\nis concerned, Naomi has been discarded because it ripens too late for\r\nthis latitude and is very subject to mildew. Moreover, grapes of its\r\ncolor are not as highly esteemed as red or black grapes and the demand\r\nfor green grapes does not sustain the varieties we have of this color.\r\n\r\nThis variety was originated by J. H. Ricketts of Newburgh, New York,\r\nfrom seed of Clinton fertilized with Muscat Hamburg. It was first\r\nexhibited before the American Pomological Society in 1879. It has not\r\nbeen widely disseminated.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, variable in productiveness. Canes very long\r\n     to medium, numerous, not uniform in size, medium dark brown\r\n     deepening in color at the nodes; tendrils intermittent, bifid.\r\n     Leaves large to below medium, thin, frequently inclined to be torn\r\n     by heavy winds, medium green; lower surface pale green, slightly\r\n     pubescent. Stamens upright. Fruit ripens late. Clusters large to\r\n     above medium, above average in length, broad to medium,\r\n     single-shouldered to sometimes double-shouldered, compact. Berries\r\n     intermediate in size, roundish to oval, light green, occasionally\r\n     with reddish-yellow tinge, glossy, covered with thin gray bloom,\r\n     persistent. Skin moderately thick, tough, not astringent. Flesh\r\n     greenish, juicy, slightly tough and solid, aromatic, sweet at skin\r\n     to tart at center, good in quality when fully ripened.

Reports from different sources give the vigor as\r\nfrom weak to vigorous, the hardiness from hardy to tender, the season\r\nfrom earlier than Moore Early to later than Concord, the size of berry\r\nfrom small to large, the productiveness from unproductive to productive\r\nto a fault.\r\n\r\nThe Nectar vines at this Station were secured from Caywood, the\r\noriginator, in 1888, and from the T. S. Hubbard Company, in 1883. Vines\r\nfrom both sources are vigorous, small-leaved, bearing medium-sized black\r\nberries of good but not high quality. These vines are nearly worthless\r\non account of their susceptibility to mildew. The resemblance to\r\nDelaware is not apparent.\r\n\r\nWe have received from Massachusetts, under the name Black Delaware, and\r\nthere is described in several publications, a grape which is strikingly\r\nlike Delaware except that the color is black. It is a grape of high\r\nquality, and the vine is described as being resistant to mildew. This\r\nvariety may be worth something. The Nectar on the Station grounds is\r\nnot. Possibly Nectar and Rommel's Black Delaware have been confused.\r\n\r\nThe variety here described was originated by Caywood. It is said to be\r\nfrom seed of Concord fertilized by Delaware. Nectar first became known\r\nto the public about 1880 under the name Black Delaware, which was\r\nafterward changed by Caywood to Nectar. It was placed on the grape list\r\nof the American Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1899, as a\r\nrecommended variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NECTAR]\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, not always hardy, usually produces light\r\n     crops, very susceptible to attacks of mildew. Canes long, of\r\n     average number, thick, surface roughened, dark reddish-brown;\r\n     nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes variable in length, of medium\r\n     thickness; pith intermediate in size; shoots pubescent; tendrils\r\n     intermittent to continuous, long, trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds medium to above in size, short and thick, open in\r\n     mid-season. Young leaves faintly tinged on under side and along\r\n     margin of upper side with rose-carmine. Leaves small to medium,\r\n     thick; upper surface dark green, rugose, often heavily wrinkled;\r\n     lower surface dull whitish or light gray, strongly pubescent; veins\r\n     distinct; lobes three to five with terminus obtuse to acute;\r\n     petiolar sinus medium in depth, wide; basal sinus shallow and open\r\n     when present; lateral sinus medium to deep, often wide; teeth very\r\n     shallow, medium to narrow. Flowers partly self-fertile, open\r\n     moderately late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Concord, does not keep long in good\r\n     condition. Clusters intermediate in size, length, and thickness,\r\n     irregularly cylindrical to tapering, often single-shouldered but\r\n     sometimes double-shouldered, medium to compact; peduncle variable\r\n     in length, slender to medium; pedicel medium to short, slender,\r\n     smooth; brush yellowish-green.

It is,\r\nhowever, a less valuable grape than Concord, and all in all, it is\r\ndoubtful if it should be ranked much if any higher than several others\r\nof the green grapes with which it must compete. Much of the popularity\r\nof Niagara is due to the novel way in which the variety was sold to the\r\npublic. For many years after its origin, the entire stock of this grape\r\nwas owned by the Niagara Grape Company, who retained all of the\r\npropagating wood, and in many instances well guarded interests in the\r\nvineyards of this variety. The advantages gained by this method of\r\ndistribution enabled the promoters of the variety to advertise it to an\r\nextent not equaled in the dissemination of any other grape. As is likely\r\nto be the case with new fruits, Niagara was overpraised by the company\r\nselling it and for a time by the horticultural press and viticulturists\r\nas well. When vineyards of the variety came into bearing, a reaction set\r\nin, and Niagara lost in popularity; many who had planted it condemned it\r\nand oftentimes unjustly. For years the reports for and against it were\r\nmore or less colored by personalities and it has not been until a\r\ncomparatively recent day that a just estimate of the variety could be\r\nobtained from grape-growers.\r\n\r\nSince one of the parents of Niagara is Concord, and since the two grapes\r\nare largely grown in the same regions and for the same general markets,\r\nand chiefly as table grapes, we may best arrive at the status of Niagara\r\nby comparing it with Concord.\r\n\r\nIn vigor and productiveness, where the two grapes are upon equal footing\r\nas to adaptability, Niagara and Concord rank the same. In these respects\r\nboth are standards scarcely surpassed among our cultivated native\r\ngrapes. In hardiness of root and vine Niagara falls somewhat short of\r\nConcord; practically all grape-growers who have tested the two varieties\r\nin cold climates agree as to the greater hardiness of Concord. In some\r\nof the grape regions of New York Niagara is not grown profitably because\r\nof its susceptibility to cold. The variety cannot be relied upon without\r\nwinter protection where the thermometer falls much below zero. Like\r\nConcord the Niagara has much of the foxiness of the wild Labrusca,\r\ndistasteful to many palates. On the other hand there are many Americans\r\nwho really like the foxy taste and aroma and count it an asset in these\r\nvarieties. The foxiness of Niagara is most marked just after the fruit\r\nis picked, and it is usually better flavored after having stood for a\r\nfew days. The flavor is not at its best unless the grapes be fully ripe.\r\nBoth bunches and berries of Niagara are larger than those of Concord and\r\nare better formed, making a handsomer fruit if the colors are liked\r\nequally well. The skin of Niagara does not crack as easily as that of\r\nConcord. The fruit shells as badly and does not keep much, if any,\r\nlonger. Both vines and fruits of Niagara are more susceptible to fungal\r\ndiseases than are those of Concord and especially to black-rot, which\r\nproves a veritable scourge with this variety in unfavorable seasons and\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NIAGARA]\r\n\r\nIt is likely that Niagara will continue for some time to be the leading\r\ngreen grape for the market. As long as grape consumers demand a showy\r\ngrape to be had at a low price, and without much regard as to quality,\r\nif the grape be passably good, Niagara will be popular. For those who\r\nrank quality first, with appearance and reasonable cost as secondary\r\nconsideration, there are other green grapes superior.\r\n\r\nNiagara was produced by C. L. Hoag and B. W. Clark of Lockport, Niagara\r\nCounty, New York. The originators state that the variety was grown from\r\nseed of Concord fertilized by Cassady, planted in 1868, and that it\r\nfruited for the first time in 1872. It was introduced about 1882 by the\r\nNiagara Grape Company. In 1885 it was placed on the grape list of the\r\nfruit catalog of the American Pomological Society. Niagara has attained\r\nits greatest popularity and is most grown in New York and in the North.\r\nIn the grape regions of the South and Southwest, it is too susceptible\r\nto fungi especially the mildews and black-rot. It is said that the\r\nquality of the variety, however, is improved as grown to the southward\r\nand that where comparatively free from diseases, or when they are\r\ncontrolled by spraying, it becomes a profitable early market grape. In\r\nOhio, Niagara is grown more or less for wine. This variety is a typical\r\nwhite seedling of Concord showing little trace of any other variety.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to medium, less hardy than Concord, productive to\r\n     very productive, somewhat subject to mildew and black-rot in\r\n     unfavorable locations. Canes medium to long, of average number,\r\n     thick, dark reddish-brown deepening in color at the nodes which are\r\n     strongly enlarged and slightly flattened; internodes medium to\r\n     long, thick; pith large to medium; shoots pubescent; tendrils\r\n     continuous, long, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds medium in size and thickness, short, slightly compressed,\r\n     conical to pointed, open in mid-season. Young leaves lightly tinged\r\n     on under side and along margin of upper side with rose-carmine.\r\n     Leaves medium to large, thick; upper surface glossy, medium dark\r\n     green, rather smooth; lower surface pale green, pubescent; veins\r\n     distinct; lobes three to five with terminus acute to acuminate;\r\n     petiolar sinus intermediate in depth and width; basal sinus\r\n     shallow, wide, often toothed; lateral sinus of mean depth, wide,\r\n     frequently toothed; teeth shallow, variable in width. Flowers\r\n     fertile, open in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Concord, keeps fairly well. Clusters large\r\n     to medium, long to medium, somewhat broad, tapering to often\r\n     cylindrical, frequently single-shouldered, moderately compact;\r\n     peduncle short to medium, thick; pedicel intermediate in length,\r\n     thick, covered with few, small, inconspicuous warts; brush pale\r\n     green, medium to long. Berries above medium to large, slightly\r\n     oval, light green changing to a pale yellowish-green tinge as the\r\n     ripening season advances, covered with thin gray bloom, persistent,\r\n     firm. Skin thin, tender, adheres somewhat to the pulp, contains no\r\n     pigment, slightly astringent. Flesh light green, translucent,\r\n     juicy, fine-grained, moderately tender, foxy, sweet next the skin\r\n     to agreeably tart at center, as good or better than Concord in\r\n     quality. Seeds separate rather easily from the pulp, one to six,\r\n     average three, intermediate in size, length and breadth, deeply\r\n     notched, brownish; raphe buried in a deep groove; chalaza of fair\r\n     size, above center, circular to oval, moderately distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOAH.\r\n\r\n(Riparia, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Gar.

It is now, however, but little grown\r\noutside of Missouri where it is still used somewhat in wine-making. In\r\nFrance Noah was largely grown for a time both as a stock for grafting\r\nand as a direct producer for the making of wine and brandy. Probably no\r\nother American grape has caused more general discussion, or received\r\nmore praise and more condemnation in France, with the result that it is\r\nnow but little grown. The name was given the variety on account of the\r\nalcoholic strength of its wine, the originator holding that the\r\nlamentable accident which befell the patriarch Noah could easily have\r\nhappened had he partaken of the wine of this grape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOAH]\r\n\r\nNoah is so like Elvira that the two are often confused. There are,\r\nhowever, very marked differences in the vine characters; and the\r\nclusters of Elvira are smaller, the berries more foxy in taste and the\r\nskins more tender and crack much more than do those of Noah. The large,\r\ndark, glossy green leaves make the vines of this variety very handsome\r\nand a vineyard of them is a pleasing sight. As with Elvira, Othello,\r\nRommel, and other varieties of this group of grapes, Noah is of little\r\nvalue in New York. These grapes are fit only for wine but the\r\nwine-makers in this State seem not to have found them desirable for\r\ntheir wants. Noah shatters badly and does not keep nor ship at all well,\r\nand buyers therefore do not care for it.\r\n\r\nNoah was originated by Otto Wasserzieher of Nauvoo, Illinois, from seed\r\nof Taylor planted in 1869, and fruited for the first time in 1873. It\r\nwas exhibited before the American Pomological Society in 1879. It was\r\nplaced on the grape list of the American Pomological Society fruit\r\ncatalog in 1881. Noah shows, like its parent, characters of both Riparia\r\nand Labrusca. The vine characters are markedly those of Riparia and,\r\namong others of these, the healthiness of the foliage is an asset of the\r\nvariety; the Labrusca shows more plainly in the fruit of Noah than in\r\nthat of Taylor, the berries being larger and having more of the foxiness\r\nthan the last named variety.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to sometimes vigorous, not hardy in severe winters,\r\n     productive, susceptible to attacks of mildew. Canes long, of\r\n     average number, thick to medium, dark brown, surface roughened;\r\n     nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes intermediate in length;\r\n     diaphragm of mean thickness; pith medium in size; shoots slightly\r\n     pubescent; tendrils usually continuous, of average length, bifid to\r\n     trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds medium to small, very short, thick to medium, somewhat\r\n     compressed, obtuse, open very late. Young leaves faintly tinged on\r\n     under side and along margin of upper side with rose-carmine. Leaves\r\n     large to medium, of average thickness; upper surface dark green,\r\n     glossy, smooth; lower surface pale green, thinly pubescent; veins\r\n     distinct; leaf usually not lobed, with terminus acuminate; petiolar\r\n     sinus deep to medium, rather wide; basal sinus lacking; lateral\r\n     sinus very shallow when present; teeth somewhat shallow, moderately\r\n     wide. Flowers sterile to semi-fertile, open early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens with Concord or later, does not ship nor keep well.\r\n     Clusters variable in size and length, above average breadth,\r\n     cylindrical to nearly tapering, usually single-shouldered, medium\r\n     to compact; peduncle intermediate in length, thick; pedicel short\r\n     to medium, covered with few, small warts; brush medium to short,\r\n     brownish. Berries small, usually roundish, light green tinged with\r\n     yellow, somewhat dull, covered with thin gray bloom, not\r\n     persistent, nearly firm. Skin variable in thickness and tenderness,\r\n     adheres to the pulp, contains no pigment, not astringent. Flesh\r\n     yellowish-green, translucent, juicy, tough, fine-grained, vinous,\r\n     tart at skin to acid at center, sprightly, good in quality. Seeds\r\n     separate with difficulty from the pulp, one to four, average two or\r\n     three, intermediate in size and breadth, rather dark brown; raphe\r\n     buried in a shallow groove; chalaza of average size, slightly above\r\n     center, oval, obscure.

Unlike the Catawba too, the fruit does not keep well, nor is\r\nthe flavor quite up to the high quality of the older variety, more\r\nnearly resembling, as it grows here, that of Agawam. It is not, however,\r\nthe fruit characters so much as those of the vine that have kept Norfolk\r\nfrom becoming popular. It falls short in several vine characters,\r\nchiefly in productiveness, and after having been known for many years is\r\nnow scarcely cultivated.\r\n\r\nN. B. White[203] of Norwood, Massachusetts, originated this variety some\r\ntime in the sixties from seed of a native Labrusca fertilized with Black\r\nHamburg.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, usually hardy, variable in productiveness.\r\n     Canes long, numerous, thick; tendrils usually intermittent, bifid\r\n     to trifid. Leaves large to medium, moderately light green, thick;\r\n     lower surface grayish-white with tinge of bronze, pubescent.\r\n     Flowers nearly fertile, open early; stamens upright. Fruit ripens\r\n     earlier than Concord, does not keep very well. Clusters medium to\r\n     small, often broad, tapering, usually with a long single shoulder,\r\n     loose. Berries large to medium, oval to roundish, dark\r\n     purplish-red somewhat resembling Catawba, covered with a fair\r\n     amount of dark lilac or faint blue bloom, shatter, rather soft.\r\n     Skin thin, inclined to tender, astringent.

Many of the differences in opinion to be\r\nfound in grape literature regarding the quality of grapes have hinged\r\nupon whether foxiness in taste and aroma is liked or not. Thus some\r\nhorticulturists put Northern Muscadine, both for the table and for wine,\r\nwell toward the head of the list of American grapes, while others\r\ncondemn it as unfit to eat. The fact that this variety, with Lucile,\r\nLutie, and others with the foxy taste strongly marked, has not become\r\npopular, in spite of particularly good vine characters, is presumptive\r\nevidence that the American public do not want such grapes. In appearance\r\nof fruit Northern Muscadine is much like Lutie, and much like it in\r\nquality, the two being distinguished from most other grapes by an\r\nunmistakable odor. A serious defect of the fruit is that the berries\r\nshatter badly as soon as the grape reaches maturity. Taken as a whole,\r\nthe vine characters of this variety are very good and it offers\r\npossibilities for the grape-breeder because of them. It cannot be\r\nrecommended for either the vineyard or the garden.\r\n\r\nThis variety originated at New Lebanon, Columbia County, New York. It\r\nwas first brought to notice by D. J. Hawkins and Philemon Stewart of the\r\nUnited Society of Shakers at that place about 1852. It was placed on the\r\ngrape list of the American Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1862 and\r\ndropped in 1871. It is a typical red Labrusca in all of its characters.\r\n\r\n     Vine variable in vigor and productiveness, healthy, not always\r\n     hardy. Canes intermediate in length and number, medium to slender,\r\n     dark brown, sometimes with a a slight red tinge, heavily pubescent;\r\n     tendrils continuous, bifid, dehisce early. Leaves medium to very\r\n     large and of distinct Labrusca type, inclined to roundish, thick;\r\n     upper surface of medium greenness, dull, medium to rugose; lower\r\n     surface dark bronze, heavily pubescent; veins well defined. Flowers\r\n     fertile to sterile, open in mid-season or earlier; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Worden, does not keep well. Clusters medium\r\n     to small, short, of average width, frequently oval but sometimes\r\n     roundish, occasionally single-shouldered, medium to compact.\r\n     Berries medium to large, roundish to oval, dark amber to dull\r\n     brownish-red, covered with thin gray bloom, drop badly from\r\n     pedicel. Skin variable in thickness, medium to tough, adheres\r\n     considerably to the pulp, contains little or no pigment, slightly\r\n     astringent. Flesh very pale green, juicy, fine-grained, tender and\r\n     soft, unusually foxy, sweet, poor in quality. Seeds separate easily\r\n     from the pulp, often numerous, large, broad, faintly notched, long,\r\n     not blunt, brownish; raphe obscure; chalaza of average size,\r\n     slightly above center, variable in shape, often showing as an\r\n     obscure depression.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTON.\r\n\r\n(Aestivalis, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= Prince, =1830=:186. =2.= _U.

NORTON'S VIRGINIA (3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,\r\n     11, 12, 13, 15, 21). _Norton's Virginia_ (14, 18). NORTON'S\r\n     VIRGINIA SEEDLING (1, 2, 4). _Virginia Seedling_ (9, 13).\r\n\r\nNorton is the leading wine grape in eastern America, and, if we except\r\nCynthiana, which can hardly be told from it, the wine made from it is\r\nthe best of its class made in the regions in which the variety will\r\ngrow. The fruit is of small value for any other purpose than wine.\r\nNorton is fairly hardy but requires a long warm season to reach\r\nmaturity. While it is said that it may be grown wherever Catawba\r\nthrives, this has not proved to be the case in New York; Norton in this\r\nState is far more precarious than Catawba in maturity, so much so that\r\nit is now scarcely grown even in the most favored parts of New York. It\r\nhas great adaptability to soils and thrives in rich alluvials or clays,\r\ngravels or sands, the only requisite seemingly being a fair amount of\r\nfertility and soil warmth. The vines are robust, very productive,\r\nespecially on fertile soils, as free, or more so, from fungal diseases\r\nthan any others of our native grapes, and very resistant to phylloxera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORTON]\r\n\r\nThe bunches of Norton are of medium size, not averaging nearly as large\r\nas the one shown in the illustration, and the berries are small; the\r\nfruit is not at all attractive in appearance. The grapes are pleasant\r\neating when fully ripe, rich and spicy, and pure-flavored but tart if\r\nnot quite ripe; but still are in no sense table grapes. The fruit keeps\r\nwell. The cluster usually ripens evenly and the berries neither shatter\r\nnor crack. The variety is difficult to propagate from cuttings and to\r\ntransplant, and the vines do not bear grafts readily.\r\n\r\nNorton has been used to quite an extent in breeding work and the blood\r\nmay be found in a number of desirable grapes but it is not a prolific\r\nparent of worthy grapes as has been the case with so many of its\r\ncontemporary varieties. Like Concord, Norton gives, in experimental\r\nwork, many white seedlings.\r\n\r\nThe origin of Norton is rather uncertain. In 1830 Prince writes that he\r\nreceived the grape from Dr. D. N. Norton, one of the pioneer\r\ngrape-growers of Richmond, Virginia, who had originated it from the seed\r\nof Bland with Miller's Burgundy growing nearby. This parentage, it\r\nappeared later, was undoubtedly an error as the Norton shows none of the\r\ncharacters of either Bland or Miller's Burgundy. Prince's description\r\nleaves little doubt but that his Norton was the Norton of to-day. In\r\n1861 there was an article published in the _Horticulturist_[204] by a\r\nMr. Lemosy saying that the original Norton vine had been discovered in\r\n1835 by his father, Dr. F. A. Lemosy of Richmond, Virginia, on an island\r\nin the James River and that Dr. Norton secured the variety from this\r\nsource. Since Norton had sent this variety to Prince prior to 1830, this\r\nstory is evidently wrong as to dates and is suspicious as to facts. It\r\nis probable that the true history of the variety will never be known.\r\nMany grapes of the Norton class have been found at the South, a fact\r\nwhich has led to much confusion as to the origin of varieties as well as\r\nin the varieties themselves. Grapes of the Norton type were not looked\r\nupon with favor by the early viticulturists and it was not until some\r\nyears after its introduction that the variety was widely planted--and\r\nthen in Missouri and not in the region of its origin. The Norton was\r\nplaced on the grape list of the American Pomological Society fruit\r\ncatalog in 1867, and is yet retained.\r\n\r\nThis variety has been usually classed as Aestivalis, which is\r\napproximately correct although most viticulturists agree that there is a\r\nstrain of Labrusca present as indicated by the occasional continuity of\r\ntendrils. Millardet, of France, believes that the variety may contain a\r\nstrain of Cinerea as well. But in fruit at least, Norton is essentially\r\na variety of Aestivalis.\r\n\r\n     Vine very vigorous, healthy, usually hardy but sometimes\r\n     half-hardy, an uncertain bearer at this Station but producing heavy\r\n     crops in more southern localities. Canes long, of average number,\r\n     thick to medium, dark brown to reddish-brown, surface covered with\r\n     considerable blue bloom; nodes much enlarged; internodes medium to\r\n     long; diaphragm thick; pith large to medium; shoots pubescent;\r\n     tendrils intermittent, occasionally continuous, long, bifid to\r\n     sometimes trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds above average size and thickness, short to medium, often\r\n     compressed, obtuse to conical, open late. Young leaves considerably\r\n     tinged on upper and under sides with bright carmine. Leaves medium\r\n     to large, irregularly roundish, of average thickness; upper surface\r\n     green, dull, rugose on older leaves; lower surface pale green,\r\n     slightly pubescent; veins indistinct; leaf usually not lobed with\r\n     terminus acute to sometimes obtuse; petiolar sinus deep to medium,\r\n     narrow, sometimes closed and overlapping; basal sinus usually\r\n     absent; lateral sinus shallow to a mere notch when present; teeth\r\n     variable in depth and width. Flowers self-fertile, open late;\r\n     stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens too late for this locality, keeps well when properly\r\n     matured. Clusters medium to small, inclined to short, moderately\r\n     broad, tapering, usually single-shouldered, medium to compact;\r\n     peduncle short to medium, thick, sometimes flattened; pedicel\r\n     intermediate in length, slender, covered with few warts; brush\r\n     dull, wine-colored. Berries medium to small, roundish to oblate,\r\n     black, somewhat glossy, covered with heavy blue bloom, persistent,\r\n     soft. Skin thin, of average toughness, does not adhere to the pulp,\r\n     contains a large amount of dark red pigment, no astringency. Flesh\r\n     greenish, translucent, juicy, tender, spicy, tart and somewhat\r\n     astringent. Seeds separate fairly easily from the pulp, two to six,\r\n     average three, numerous, medium to small, intermediate in breadth\r\n     and length, not notched, brownish; raphe distinct; chalaza small,\r\n     above center, circular, obscure.

It is rather\r\nmore hardy than most other grapes of its breeding and is preeminently a\r\nlong keeper, surpassing most of the similar hybrids in this respect,\r\nthough all of these are notable for their keeping quality. But the\r\nvariety is incapable of self-fertilization and does not set its fruit\r\nwell even in a mixed vineyard, which fault should debar it from either\r\nthe commercial or the amateur list. The quality is from good to very\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nN. B. White originated Norwood from seed of Concord fertilized with\r\nBlack Hamburg. It was introduced about 1880 and has been rather widely\r\ntested but has never been popular, and is now seldom seen in varietal\r\nvineyards.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, subject to winter injury in unfavorable locations,\r\n     variable in productiveness. Canes intermediate in length and\r\n     number, slender; tendrils continuous to intermittent, bifid. Leaves\r\n     large, not uniform in color, thin; lower surface grayish-green,\r\n     thinly pubescent. Flowers sterile to imperfectly self-fertile, open\r\n     late; stamens short. Fruit ripens a little earlier than Concord,\r\n     keeps and ships well. Clusters large to medium, often long and\r\n     broad, irregularly tapering, sometimes heavily single-shouldered,\r\n     intermediate in compactness. Berries large, roundish to oval,\r\n     purplish-black covered with heavy blue bloom, very persistent,\r\n     firm. Skin thick, rather tough, adheres considerably to the pulp,\r\n     decidedly astringent.

The grape is somewhat interesting from its singular\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 some grape cuttings in a cigar-box were left at the home of\r\nNicholas Longworth of Cincinnati, Ohio, during Mr. Longworth's absence\r\nfrom home. The man who left them did not return and Longworth could not\r\nsucceed in tracing the donor's identity. From these came Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio has, at different times, been said to be the same, in turn, as\r\nHerbemont, Lenoir and Norton. In regard to the first, Longworth had\r\nHerbemont in cultivation before he received the Ohio and neither he nor\r\nhis vineyardists failed to see distinct and constant differences between\r\nthe two varieties. The last two are disposed of in the _Cincinnati\r\nHorticultural Society Report_ given on the next page. Longworth and\r\nothers corroborated these statements from their own comparisons of the\r\nvarieties growing in the vineyards around Cincinnati. Many\r\ngrape-growers, and Longworth of the number, have been of the opinion\r\nthat Ohio might be the same as the variety cultivated in Mississippi\r\nunder the name Jack or Jacques, both names being corruptions of Jacquez,\r\nan old Spaniard who had introduced the grape into the section around\r\nNatchez. The Ohio is probably now obsolete. It did not succeed north of\r\nCincinnati and its culture was dropped in the place of its origin on\r\naccount of its susceptibility to mildew and black-rot.\r\n\r\nThe following description of Ohio is taken from a report to the\r\nCincinnati Horticultural Society:[205] \"Very fine specimens of the grape\r\ncultivated under this name, were presented by N. Longworth and J. E.\r\nMottier, some of the bunches measuring nine inches in length. As there\r\nhas been some belief expressed by eastern cultivators, that this grape\r\nis the same as Norton's Seedling, of Virginia, the committee took pains\r\nto examine them together, in Mr. Longworth's garden, where both were\r\npointed out to us by Mr. Sleath, the gardener. The difference between\r\nthe two was at once apparent and striking. In the grape shown as the\r\nNorton's Seedling, said by Mr. Sleath to have been obtained from Mr.\r\nNorton himself, the wood is not so bright a red as in the Ohio, and the\r\nleaf is large and entire, whereas that in the Ohio is three-lobed; the\r\nbud is also much less prominent and not so pointed as in the Ohio. The\r\nbunches of fruit in the Norton's Seedling were shorter and more compact,\r\nwith a thick pulp. In the Ohio, the bunches were long, very much\r\nshouldered, conical or sharp-pointed, and the fruit without\r\npulp--sweeter, more juicy and vinous in flavor, and the seeds smaller,\r\ndarker colored and less numerous than in the Norton's Seedling.\r\n\r\n\"The Committee think the grape brought into notice here, by N.\r\nLongworth, Esq., under the names of the Ohio or Cigar box, a valuable\r\nand distinct variety, and well worthy of cultivation. This grape has a\r\nstronger resemblance to the Le Noir which was also growing near; but its\r\nbunches were more shouldered, more pointed, and less compact.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(II) OHIO.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _U.

It was sold by subscription in 1884\r\nand thereby somewhat widely distributed but has not generally been\r\nreported upon with favor and is of doubtful value. There are many\r\ncomplaints of its being unfruitful and some of its being unhealthy and\r\nin consequence a weak grower. In some sections, however, it is fairly\r\nsatisfactory. While it keeps well it is said to lose flavor soon after\r\npicking. Oneida is one of the rare sorts with erect stamens and yet\r\nself-sterile.\r\n\r\nH. Thacher of Oneida County, New York, originated Oneida from seed of\r\nMerrimac planted in 1871. It bore its first fruit in 1875 and was\r\nintroduced by A. M. Purdy of Palmyra in 1884. The vine characters are\r\nlargely those of Labrusca but the fruit shows very strongly the descent\r\nfrom Vinifera. Unlike the berries of Labrusca there is no disagreeable\r\ntaste near either skin or seeds and the texture of skin and flesh is\r\nmuch like that of the European Malaga.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium in vigor, not hardy, variable in productiveness,\r\n     somewhat subject to attacks of fungi. Canes medium to long,\r\n     numerous, often rather slender, roughened; tendrils continuous,\r\n     bifid. Leaves large to medium, moderately light green; lower\r\n     surface pale green, pubescent. Flowers sterile, open medium late;\r\n     stamens upright. Fruit ripens later than Concord, keeps well.\r\n     Clusters small to medium, tapering, usually single-shouldered,\r\n     loose. Berries variable in size, roundish, handsome red in color,\r\n     almost equal to Delaware although in some seasons the berries have\r\n     an unattractive greenish-red color. Skin thick, adheres\r\n     considerably to the pulp. Flesh somewhat stringy, tender, vinous,\r\n     sweet from skin to center, with some Vinifera sprightliness, fair\r\n     to good in quality. Seeds separate easily from the pulp, not\r\n     numerous, rather large, broad, short, plump, usually with a small\r\n     enlarged neck; chalaza large, distinct, roughened.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPORTO.\r\n\r\n(Riparia, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mag.

The name\r\nhas given many the idea that the grape is a European variety--a misnomer\r\nin this respect, as its botanical characters show it to be a cross\r\nbetween Riparia and Labrusca. The variety is now scarcely known, being\r\ninferior in most of its horticultural characters to others of its\r\nspecies, but it might be valuable in breeding work for some of its\r\ncharacters. Oporto is very hardy, unusually free from fungal diseases,\r\nand its must is very thick and dark, even staining the hands a deep\r\npurple, hence suitable for adding color to wines. The variety is very\r\nresistant to phylloxera and has been used in France as a\r\nphylloxera-resistant grafting stock.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this variety is unknown. It was introduced into\r\ncultivation about 1860 by E. W. Sylvester of Lyons, New York. The Oporto\r\nwas placed on the American Pomological Society list in 1862 and removed\r\nin 1867. The botanical characters indicate that this variety is a\r\nRiparia-Labrusca cross-breed. It has much the same vine characters as\r\nClinton, but is, if anything, more rampant in growth than that vigorous\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to very vigorous, unusually hardy, healthy, variable\r\n     in productiveness. Canes above medium to long, of medium thickness,\r\n     dark brown to reddish-brown, surface covered with thin blue bloom;\r\n     tendrils continuous, bifid. Stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens with Concord, ships and keeps well. Clusters medium to\r\n     small, inferior in length, intermediate in width, cylindrical to\r\n     oval, often single-shouldered, variable in compactness. Berries\r\n     below medium in size, roundish to oblate, frequently compressed on\r\n     account of compactness of cluster, black, glossy, covered with\r\n     abundant blue bloom, persistent, firm. Skin very thin, tender,\r\n     contains a large amount of dark wine-colored pigment. Flesh nearly\r\n     white, or sometimes with purplish tinge, moderately juicy,\r\n     fine-grained, inclined to solid, sweet to somewhat acid, decidedly\r\n     spicy, of fair quality. Seeds separate somewhat easily from the\r\n     pulp, often numerous, below medium to small, of average length,\r\n     inclined to broad, faintly notched, often sharply pointed, plump,\r\n     dark brown; raphe sometimes shows as a partly submerged cord in the\r\n     shallow groove; chalaza of average size, above center, oval, nearly\r\n     obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIENTAL.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= Barry, =1883=:449. =2.= _Kan.

While a good\r\ngrape, it is doubtful if it can take the place of the better known\r\nvarieties of Rogers. Like many grapes of this class its fruit is of high\r\nquality but the vine is of only moderate vigor and is susceptible to\r\nmildew and black-rot. Oriental is more satisfactory in the dry portions\r\nof the middle West than in New York.\r\n\r\nThis variety was produced by N. B. White of Norwood, Massachusetts, from\r\nseed of a wild Labrusca fertilized with Black Hamburg pollen.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, not always hardy, averages with Concord in\r\n     productiveness. Canes unusually long, above medium in number and\r\n     thickness, surface slightly roughened; tendrils continuous,\r\n     sometimes intermittent, bifid to trifid. Leaves large, green; lower\r\n     surface grayish-green, pubescent. Fruit ripens about ten days\r\n     before Concord, keeps well. Clusters intermediate in size and\r\n     length, broad, vary from single-shouldered to double-shouldered,\r\n     loose. Berries large to medium, oval to roundish, dull dark red,\r\n     covered with lilac bloom, inclined to drop somewhat from pedicel,\r\n     soft. Skin thick, tough, with but little astringency. Flesh\r\n     somewhat tough, stringy, coarse, vinous, sweet from skin to center,\r\n     good in quality. Seeds adherent to the pulp, often numerous, large,\r\n     long, medium to broad, blunt; chalaza central to distinctly above\r\n     center, frequently with shallow radiating furrows.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Riparia, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Gar.

The significance of the name is not apparent unless,\r\nbecause of its dark color, it was christened after Shakespeare's dusky\r\nMoor. In France, Othello does remarkably well as a direct producer and\r\nis used somewhat for a resistant stock. While most of its characters are\r\nspoken of in the superlative by the French, in America it is not so\r\nhighly thought of chiefly because of its susceptibility to fungi, though\r\nit shows other weaknesses which seem inherent to hybrids of Vinifera and\r\nnative species when grown in this country. The fruit of Othello matures\r\nso late that it could never become a valuable variety for any\r\nconsiderable portion of New York. It is in no sense a table grape nor\r\ndoes it make, according to the French,[206] a high grade of wine, but\r\nrather a well-colored, pleasant, ordinary wine of considerable alcoholic\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OTHELLO]\r\n\r\nCharles Arnold of Paris, Brant County, Ontario, produced Othello from\r\nseed of Clinton fertilized by Black Hamburg. The seed was planted in\r\n1859 and the variety was sent out for testing about ten years later.\r\nThere seems considerable doubt whether Arnold's Clinton was the same as\r\nthe variety known under that name in the United States, but if not, it\r\nwas similar. Assuming that Arnold's is the well known Clinton, Othello\r\nis descended from Labrusca, Riparia and Vinifera. The characters of the\r\nthree species are shown in the variety. The foxy flavor, the tomentum of\r\nthe leaf, the pulpy flesh, and the usually continuous tendrils are all\r\nfrom Labrusca. Riparia is revealed in the long, slender canes, the\r\nresistance to phylloxera and the shallow, spreading root system. There\r\nare but few of the characters of Black Hamburg, the Vinifera parent, to\r\nbe found and yet the much lobed leaf, the cluster, the oval berry and\r\nthe flavor indicate the Old World grape and make fairly certain the\r\ntriple origin.\r\n\r\n     Vines vigorous, hardy, usually productive, slightly susceptible to\r\n     attacks of mildew in some localities. Canes long, intermediate in\r\n     number and size, light to dark brown; nodes enlarged, frequently\r\n     strongly flattened; internodes medium to below in length; diaphragm\r\n     of average thickness; pith intermediate in size; shoots pubescent;\r\n     tendrils continuous, sometimes intermittent, of medium length,\r\n     bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds intermediate in size, length and width, conical to nearly\r\n     obtuse. Leaves of average size and thickness; upper surface light\r\n     green, dull and smooth; lower surface pale green, pubescent; lobes\r\n     three to five with terminal lobe acute to obtuse; petiolar sinus\r\n     deep to medium, very narrow, frequently closed and overlapping;\r\n     basal sinus shallow, narrow; lateral sinus deep to medium, not\r\n     wide; teeth medium to very deep, rather wide; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens late, keeps fairly well. Clusters very large to above\r\n     medium, long, broad, tapering, frequently with a loose single\r\n     shoulder, two to three bunches per shoot, compact; peduncle medium\r\n     to long, intermediate in thickness; pedicel nearly long, medium to\r\n     slender, covered with numerous small warts, enlarged at point of\r\n     attachment to fruit; brush very short, wine-colored. Berries large\r\n     to medium, oval to roundish, black, glossy, covered with abundant\r\n     blue bloom, very persistent, intermediate in firmness. Skin thin,\r\n     tough, adheres strongly to the pulp, contains a moderate amount of\r\n     bright colored red pigment, without astringency. Flesh dark green,\r\n     very juicy, fine-grained, slightly tough, sprightly, low in quality\r\n     for table use. Seeds separate somewhat easily from the pulp, one to\r\n     three in number, medium to below in size, of average length and\r\n     breadth, with neck sometimes slightly swollen, brownish; raphe\r\n     usually distinct; chalaza small, above center, oval to circular,\r\n     not obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nOZARK.\r\n\r\n(Aestivalis, Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mo.

Its\r\nmerits and demerits have been threshed out by the Missouri grape-growers\r\nwith the result that its culture is somewhat increasing. It is a wine\r\nand not a table grape, of low quality, partly, perhaps, from overbearing\r\nwhich it habitually does unless the fruit is thinned. It is healthy and\r\na very strong grower; but is self-sterile, which is against it as a\r\nmarket sort. In spite of self-sterility and low quality, however, it is\r\na promising sort for the country south of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nOzark was originated by Dr. J. Stayman of Leavenworth, Kansas, from seed\r\nwhich he states was from an unknown source. The variety was introduced\r\nby Stayman & Black about 1890. The variety apparently is of Aestivalis\r\ndescent with a slight admixture of Labrusca. There was another\r\nOzark[207] raised by Frederick Muench of Marthasville, Warren County,\r\nMissouri, in 1851. It has probably long been obsolete.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to very vigorous, usually hardy, medium to very\r\n     productive. Canes rather long, often somewhat thick, intermediate\r\n     in number, covered with thin blue bloom, surface slightly\r\n     roughened; tendrils intermittent, usually bifid. Leaves unusually\r\n     healthy and attractive, dense, medium to large, light green; lower\r\n     surface pale green, thinly pubescent and cobwebby. Flowers sterile\r\n     or nearly so, open late; stamens reflexed. Fruit ripens late, keeps\r\n     well. Clusters medium to large, long to medium, usually with a long\r\n     and loose single shoulder, very compact. Berries variable in size,\r\n     dull black, covered with abundant blue bloom, persistent. Skin\r\n     variable in thickness, tough, contains a large amount of\r\n     wine-colored pigment. Flesh not very juicy, tender when fully ripe,\r\n     mild, fair in quality. Seeds separate somewhat easily from the\r\n     pulp, medium to small, not notched; raphe shows as a distinct\r\n     cord-like ridge; chalaza plainly above center, very distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEABODY.\r\n\r\n(Riparia, Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Bush.

The grapes are too small for dessert purposes and their value\r\nfor wine seems not to have been determined though from its parentage it\r\nwould be called a wine grape. In general appearance Peabody resembles\r\nRicketts' Advance but is later, not so strong a grower, nor so prolific\r\nnor hardy. It appears to do better in the northern tier of states or in\r\nCanada than farther south.\r\n\r\nThis variety is supposed to be a seedling of Clinton grown by J. H.\r\nRicketts about 1870 and introduced in 1882. The fruit is distinctly\r\ndifferent in several characters from Clinton or other seedlings of that\r\nvariety suggesting that Peabody is not a pure-bred seedling.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, produces medium crops. Canes long, numerous,\r\n     often thick, light brown with ash-gray tinge, considerably darker\r\n     at nodes, covered with thin blue bloom; tendrils intermittent,\r\n     bifid to trifid. Leaves medium to above in size, dark green, thin,\r\n     lower surface pale green, nearly glabrous. Flowers semi-fertile,\r\n     open in mid-season; stamens upright. Fruit ripens rather early,\r\n     keeps well. Clusters large to medium, medium to long, usually with\r\n     a fair-sized shoulder connected to the bunch by a long stem,\r\n     compact to medium. Berries intermediate in size, distinctly oval to\r\n     roundish, black, glossy, covered with abundant blue bloom,\r\n     persistent. Skin thick, tough, not astringent. Flesh very juicy,\r\n     tender, vinous, spicy, agreeably sweet at skin to tart at center,\r\n     good in quality. Seeds usually separate from the pulp easily when\r\n     fully mature, intermediate in size, broad; raphe sometimes shows as\r\n     a partially submerged cord in the bottom of a rather wide, deep\r\n     groove; chalaza distinctly above center, often roughened.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERFECTION.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Bourquiniana, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mo.

In its vine\r\ncharacters it is much more like a Labrusca than Delaware, suggesting\r\nthat it is a Delaware cross. In the Southwest it is considered a\r\nvaluable early red grape.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Stayman of Leavenworth, Kansas, originated Perfection from seed\r\nof Delaware; sent out for testing about 1890.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, healthy, injured in severe winters,\r\n     productive. Canes intermediate in length and number, slender;\r\n     tendrils intermittent, trifid to bifid. Leaves healthy, medium in\r\n     size and color; lower surface grayish-white with tinge of bronze,\r\n     heavily pubescent. Flowers fertile or nearly so, open in\r\n     mid-season; stamens upright. Fruit ripens before Delaware, does not\r\n     keep well. Clusters intermediate in size, averaging slightly larger\r\n     than Delaware, of fair length, usually single-shouldered, compact.\r\n     Berries medium to small, nearly roundish when not misshapen by\r\n     compactness of cluster, attractive red but slightly less brilliant\r\n     than Delaware, covered with thin gray or faint lilac bloom,\r\n     inclined to drop from pedicel, soft. Skin thin, variable in\r\n     toughness, not astringent. Flesh medium in juiciness and\r\n     tenderness, vinous, mild, moderately sweet, good in quality but\r\n     inferior to Delaware.

Its pulp is\r\nhard and its flavor is that of Wyoming, Northern Muscadine and their\r\nlike, all easily identified and best characterized by their disagreeable\r\nfoxiness. As with nearly all Labruscas it is a very poor keeper.\r\nNotwithstanding the faults of its fruit, Perkins may have value in\r\nregions where grape-growing is precarious; for it is one of the most\r\nreliable grapes cultivated, being hardy, vigorous, productive, and very\r\nfree from fungal diseases. Added to the above qualities, it is early,\r\nthus making a plant well worthy the attention of the grape-breeder.\r\n\r\nThis variety is said to be an accidental seedling found about 1830 in\r\nthe garden of Jacob Perkins of Bridgewater, Massachusetts. For many\r\nyears it had only a local reputation and became known to viticulturists\r\nabout 1860. It was placed on the grape list of the American Pomological\r\nSociety fruit catalog in 1875 and although several efforts have been\r\nmade to have it removed it still remains. It was suspected by some of\r\nthose familiar with its early history to be a seedling of Isabella or\r\nCatawba but there is little or nothing in the vine or fruit to\r\nsubstantiate such a supposition.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, healthy, hardy, productive. Canes long to medium,\r\n     numerous, thick to medium, rather dark brown, deepening in color at\r\n     the nodes, surface heavily pubescent; tendrils continuous, bifid to\r\n     trifid. Leaves above medium to small, thick; upper surface medium\r\n     green, medium to slightly rugose; lower surface grayish-white,\r\n     heavily pubescent; veins distinct. Flowers nearly fertile, open\r\n     medium early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens earlier than Delaware, ships well for an early grape.\r\n     Clusters intermediate in size and length, broad to medium,\r\n     cylindrical to slightly tapering, often with a short single\r\n     shoulder, compact. Berries large to medium, distinctly oval, dull\r\n     green changing to an attractive pale lilac or light red when fully\r\n     ripe, covered with rather abundant gray or lilac bloom, inclined to\r\n     drop considerably from the pedicel, somewhat soft. Skin thin,\r\n     tough, contains no pigment. Flesh nearly white, medium juicy,\r\n     stringy, fine-grained, firm and meaty, very foxy, sweet at skin to\r\n     nearly acid at center, poor to fair in quality. Seeds decidedly\r\n     adherent, numerous, medium to above in size, width and length,\r\n     somewhat blunt, light brown with yellow tips; raphe buried in a\r\n     narrow, nearly deep groove; chalaza small, distinctly above center,\r\n     oval to pear-shaped, rather distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOCKLINGTON.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Gar.

The\r\nvariety had the fatal fault, however, of ripening late in the latitude\r\nof New York which, with some minor defects, has caused it to fall below\r\nNiagara in value for the grape districts of this region if not for the\r\nwhole country. It is now being grown less and less, and though still\r\ncommonly found, must soon become largely a grape for the amateur and the\r\ncollector.\r\n\r\nPocklington is a seedling of Concord and resembles its parent in most of\r\nits vine characters, fully equaling or surpassing it in hardiness, but\r\nof slower growth and not quite as healthy, vigorous or productive. In\r\nquality it is as good if not better than either Concord or Niagara,\r\nbeing sweet, rich and pleasant flavored, though as with the other two\r\ngrapes it has a little too much foxiness for critical consumers of\r\ngrapes. It is a handsome fruit, a delicate golden yellow in color, being\r\noften called the Golden Pocklington, and with finely formed bunches and\r\nberries making it one of the most attractive of all green grapes.\r\nPocklington keeps and ships better than Concord or than any of the\r\nlatter's seedlings, having a tough, though comparatively thin, skin.\r\nUnder some conditions, it ripens unevenly and in some localities it is\r\nunfruitful. Pocklington is not equal to several other of the grapes of\r\nits season in quality, as, for instance Iona, Jefferson, Diana, Dutchess\r\nand Catawba, but it is far above the average as a table grape and for\r\nthis reason and because of its handsome appearance, one of the most\r\nattractive of all green grapes, it should be retained in our list of\r\ngrapes for the garden.\r\n\r\nJohn Pocklington of Sandy Hill, Washington County, New York, originated\r\nPocklington from seed of Concord about 1870. The variety was first\r\nexhibited at the New York State fair in Rochester, in 1877, and was\r\nexhibited before the American Pomological Society two years later. It\r\nwas introduced by John Charlton of Rochester, New York, about 1880. In\r\n1881 it was placed on the grape list of the American Pomological Society\r\nfruit catalog. In spite of its general failure as a commercial sort, it\r\nis still offered for sale by many nurserymen.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium in vigor, hardy, variable in productiveness, somewhat\r\n     subject to mildew in the Hudson River and Central Lakes districts.\r\n     Canes intermediate in length, number, and size, very dark\r\n     reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes medium to\r\n     below in length; diaphragm thin; pith slightly above average size;\r\n     shoots pubescent; tendrils continuous, of fair length, bifid to\r\n     trifid.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: POCKLINGTON]\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds small, very short, slender, pointed, open late.

There is no doubt as to its quality, both as a\r\ntable grape and for wine; in this respect it is considered by many as\r\nequal to the best of our American varieties and quite the equal of some\r\nof the finer European sorts. But the vine characters are practically all\r\npoor and the variety is thus effectually debarred from common\r\ncultivation. Both vine and fruit greatly resemble Delaware but it is not\r\nthe equal of the latter variety in vine characters and does not surpass\r\nit in fruit. In particular, it is more easily winter-killed and is less\r\nproductive than Delaware. It ripens with us a little earlier than the\r\nlast named sort and this with its beauty and fine quality is sufficient\r\nto recommend it for the garden at least.\r\n\r\nA. J. Caywood of Marlboro, New York, originated Poughkeepsie, it is\r\nsaid, from seed of Iona fertilized by mixed pollen of Delaware and\r\nWalter. The original seedling was raised in the sixties but the variety\r\nwas only known locally until about 1880 when it was brought before the\r\npublic. It has never been popular in any section and is now nearly\r\nobsolete.\r\n\r\n     Vine intermediate in vigor, doubtfully hardy, variable in\r\n     productiveness, some seasons producing such heavy crops that the\r\n     vine is weakened, and on this account a somewhat uncertain bearer.\r\n     Canes medium to short, intermediate in number, thick to medium,\r\n     dark reddish-brown; tendrils intermittent, frequently three in\r\n     line, bifid to trifid. Leaves not healthy, medium to small, of\r\n     average thickness; upper surface medium green, glossy, somewhat\r\n     rugose on older leaves; lower surface pale green to grayish-green,\r\n     thinly pubescent. Flowers fertile, open medium late; stamens\r\n     upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Delaware, keeps and ships fairly well.\r\n     Clusters medium to below in size, intermediate in length and width,\r\n     tapering to cylindrical, usually single-shouldered, very compact.\r\n     Berries small, roundish, pale red to attractive red when properly\r\n     ripened, covered with a medium amount of dark lilac bloom,\r\n     persistent, firm. Skin thin and tender but does not crack, contains\r\n     no pigment. Flesh pale green, very juicy, tender, nearly melting,\r\n     fine-grained, vinous, sweet or nearly so from skin to center,\r\n     refreshing, very good to best in quality. The flesh characters\r\n     closely resemble Delaware. Seeds separate easily from the pulp,\r\n     small, of medium length, medium to broad, usually plump with\r\n     slightly enlarged neck, brownish; raphe obscure; chalaza of average\r\n     size, distinctly above center, circular, obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRENTISS.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mich.

If popular preference\r\nturned upon quality, we should still grow this variety, but\r\nconsideration must be given to other characters and in these Prentiss\r\nfails. Those who have grown it in the several grape districts of New\r\nYork accredit the vines with about all the faults a grape can have.\r\nThus, it is almost universally considered tender to cold, lacking in\r\nvigor and being unproductive, while in some localities it is looked upon\r\nas uncertain in bearing, and subject to rot and mildew. On the other\r\nhand, there are vineyards in which it does very well and in such it is a\r\nremarkably attractive green grape, especially in form of cluster and in\r\nform and color of berry, in these respects resembling the one-time\r\nfavorite Rebecca though never so high in quality as that variety. Its\r\nseason is given as both before and after Concord. It must always remain\r\na variety for the amateur and for special localities.\r\n\r\nThis variety is said to have been originated by J. W. Prentiss of\r\nPulteney, Steuben County, New York, about forty years ago, from seed of\r\nIsabella.[208] It was introduced about 1880 by T. S. Hubbard of\r\nFredonia, New York. In 1881 it was placed on the catalog of the American\r\nPomological Society and is still retained.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to weak, with a tendency to winter injury, unfruitful,\r\n     capricious in bearing, somewhat subject to attacks of mildew. Canes\r\n     intermediate in length and number, thick, light to dark brown;\r\n     tendrils continuous, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaves above medium to small, thick; upper surface light green,\r\n     smooth to rugose in the older leaves; lower surface pale green,\r\n     pubescent; veins obscure. Flowers self-fertile, open in mid-season;\r\n     stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit variable in season of ripening averaging about with Concord,\r\n     keeps well. Clusters not large, medium to short, of average width,\r\n     tapering to cylindrical, sometimes with a slight single shoulder,\r\n     compact. Berries above medium to small, vary in shape from roundish\r\n     to oval, light green with strong yellowish tinge covered with thin\r\n     gray bloom, persistent, firm. Skin of medium thickness, somewhat\r\n     tough, contains no pigment. Flesh pale green, juicy, medium in\r\n     tenderness, slightly foxy, sweet next the skin to agreeably tart at\r\n     center, good in quality.

It is wholly unsuited for\r\ncommercial vineyards and for years has gradually been disappearing from\r\ncultivation. The fruit of Rebecca is exceptionally fine, consisting of\r\nwell-formed bunches and berries, the latter a handsome yellowish-white\r\nand semitransparent. In quality it is of the best, with a rich, sweet\r\nflavor and pleasing aroma. But the vine characters condemn it for any\r\nbut the amateur and even in the garden it must have exceptionally good\r\ncare to succeed. The vines lack in hardiness and vigor, are susceptible\r\nto mildew and other fungi, and are productive only under the best\r\nconditions. It is recommended as being especially desirable to plant on\r\nsouth walls where it seems to succeed much better than in exposed\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\nThe original vine of this variety was an accidental seedling found in\r\nthe garden of E. M. Peake at Hudson, New York. It bore its first fruit\r\nin 1852 when the vine was four years old and was brought to the notice\r\nof the public four or five years later. The Massachusetts Horticultural\r\nSociety awarded the variety their silver medal in 1856 and it was\r\nexhibited before the American Pomological Society the same year. Here it\r\nmade so favorable an impression that it was placed with Concord and\r\nDelaware under \"new varieties which promise well.\" In 1862 it was placed\r\non the regular list where it remained till 1891, when it was removed. It\r\nwas introduced by W. Brooksbank of Hudson.\r\n\r\n     Vine weak to vigorous, not always hardy, not productive, somewhat\r\n     susceptible to attacks of mildew. Canes long to below medium,\r\n     numerous, above medium to slender, inclined to dull brown,\r\n     deepening in color at the nodes; tendrils continuous to\r\n     intermittent, bifid to trifid.

It is one of comparatively few\r\npure-bred offspring of Vinifera-Labrusca crosses of the second\r\ngeneration and therefore of interest to grape-breeders. Munson, the\r\noriginator of the variety, does not include Red Eagle in his last\r\ncatalog but on the grounds of this Station it takes high rank as a grape\r\nof quality and at least can be recommended to the amateur. In general it\r\nshows the characters found in Rogers' first generation hybrids and ranks\r\nwith them in fruit and vine.\r\n\r\nThe variety was originated by T. V. Munson, from whom it was received at\r\nthis Station in 1888.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium in vigor, injured in severe winters, moderately\r\n     productive. Canes of average length, medium to few, slender, dark\r\n     brown, surface covered with a small amount of blue bloom; nodes\r\n     prominent, slightly flattened; internodes of fair length; diaphragm\r\n     intermediate in thickness; pith medium in size; shoots pubescent;\r\n     tendrils continuous to intermittent, long to medium, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds medium to below in size, short, of average thickness,\r\n     conical to obtuse, open late. Young leaves heavily tinged on under\r\n     side and lightly along margin of upper side with rose-carmine.\r\n     Leaves intermediate in size, thick; upper surface light green,\r\n     dull, medium to slightly rugose; lower surface grayish-green,\r\n     slightly pubescent; veins well defined; lobes three to five with\r\n     terminus obtuse to acute; petiolar sinus deep, medium to narrow,\r\n     sometimes closed and overlapping; basal sinus variable in depth,\r\n     wide; lateral sinus often very deep, somewhat wide; teeth medium to\r\n     deep, wide. Flowers sterile to fertile, open moderately late;\r\n     stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens a little before Concord, keeps fairly well. Clusters\r\n     medium to small, variable in length, broad, slightly tapering,\r\n     usually single-shouldered but sometimes double-shouldered, loose to\r\n     medium with many abortive berries; peduncle nearly long to medium,\r\n     inclined to slender; pedicel very long, slender; brush pale green\r\n     with brown tinge, short to medium, rather slender. Berries variable\r\n     in size, roundish, light to very dark red, not glossy, covered with\r\n     heavy lilac or faint blue bloom, persistent, rather soft. Skin\r\n     medium to thick, tender, adheres slightly to the pulp, contains a\r\n     small amount of red pigment, without astringency. Flesh greenish,\r\n     transparent, juicy, very tender and melting, slightly foxy,\r\n     agreeably tart next the skin to slightly acid at center, very good\r\n     in quality. Seeds separate easily from the pulp, one to five,\r\n     average three or four, often rather large, of mean breadth, long,\r\n     somewhat blunt, light brown; raphe buried in a narrow, shallow\r\n     groove; chalaza large, above center, irregularly circular to oval,\r\n     distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGAL.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Rural N.

The fact is again demonstrated in this variety that the\r\ncharacters of grape-hybrids, at least of these two species, are passed\r\nto subsequent generations much as they were found in the first\r\ngeneration. The fruit of Regal is attractive in appearance and in\r\nquality, its characters being much the same as those of Lindley. A\r\nseemingly insignificant fault might make it somewhat undesirable in a\r\ncommercial vineyard; it is that the clusters are borne so close to the\r\nwood that it is difficult to harvest the fruit, and especially to avoid\r\ninjury to the berries next to the wood. The variety is worthy of\r\nextensive trial in the vineyards and gardens of the State.\r\n\r\nRegal was originated in Rockford, Illinois, in 1879 by A. W. Woodward.\r\nIt was introduced some years later by M. Crawford of Cuyahoga Falls,\r\nOhio. The original vine was one of a lot of Lindley seedlings. Some\r\nvines of this variety were sent out by the introducer under the title\r\n_Crawford No. 99_.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, very productive. Canes intermediate\r\n     in length and size, rather numerous, medium dark reddish-brown.\r\n     Tendrils intermittent, bifid to trifid. Leaves healthy, medium to\r\n     nearly large, of average thickness; upper surface green, slightly\r\n     glossy and rugose; lower surface pale green with bronze tinge,\r\n     strongly pubescent. Flowers fully self-fertile, open in mid-season;\r\n     stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens with Lindley or later; keeps well. Clusters small to\r\n     medium, shorter than Lindley, medium to broad, cylindrical to\r\n     tapering with sometimes an inclination to oval, usually with a\r\n     short single shoulder, sometimes double-shouldered, very compact.\r\n     Berries above medium to below, averaging larger than Brighton,\r\n     roundish but frequently compressed on account of compactness of\r\n     cluster, purplish-red to dark red, covered with lilac bloom,\r\n     persistent, of average firmness. Skin thin, medium to tough,\r\n     contains no pigment. Flesh pale green, very juicy, fine-grained,\r\n     slightly stringy and solid until fully ripe when it becomes rather\r\n     tender, sweet at skin to acid at center, slightly musky, good in\r\n     quality but not equal to Lindley. Seeds separate easily from the\r\n     pulp, rather numerous, intermediate in size, long to below medium,\r\n     above medium to narrow, slightly notched, inclined to blunt,\r\n     frequently with a short enlarged neck, brownish; raphe buried in a\r\n     medium-sized groove; chalaza small, above center, circular to oval,\r\n     distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUA.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _U.

It is an attractive grape in cluster and berry and of very good\r\nquality but quite subject to rot and ripening too late for the grape\r\nregions of this latitude, being as late as Catawba. In giving his grapes\r\nnames, Rogers used those of English or German horticultural or botanical\r\ncelebrities and of some of the Indian names of counties and towns of\r\nMassachusetts. Requa was dedicated by Rogers to a Mr. Requa, a\r\nhorticulturist of local note, of Salem-on-Erie, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the parentage and early history of this variety see\r\nRogers' Hybrids. In 1869 this variety was named Requa, it having been\r\npreviously known as _Rogers' No. 28_. There appear at present to be two\r\nvarieties passing under this name. Georgia, Texas and Missouri report\r\nthis variety as having erect stamens but in our vineyard it shows only\r\nrecurved stamens.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, hardy except in severe winters, medium in\r\n     productiveness, not always healthy. Canes medium to long,\r\n     intermediate in number and thickness; tendrils continuous to\r\n     intermittent, trifid to bifid. Leaves large to medium, dark green,\r\n     often thick and rugose; lower surface grayish-green, pubescent.\r\n     Flowers sterile to partly fertile, open late; stamens reflexed.\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Catawba or earlier, keeps a long time in\r\n     good condition. Clusters large to medium, intermediate in length\r\n     and width, nearly cylindrical, often with a long single shoulder,\r\n     compact. Berries medium to large, slightly oval to roundish, dark\r\n     dull red covered with thin gray or lilac bloom, strongly adherent,\r\n     not firm. Skin thin, nearly tough, adheres considerably to the\r\n     pulp. Flesh very pale green, somewhat tender, rather stringy,\r\n     vinous, slightly foxy, almost sweet from skin to center, good to\r\n     very good in quality. Seeds slightly adherent to the pulp, above\r\n     medium to medium in size and length, often rather broad, somewhat\r\n     blunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nROCHESTER.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _W.

The vine\r\nis a particularly strong grower and very productive and in the locality\r\nin and about Rochester at least, very free from diseases. It is so very\r\nvigorous that it needs much room and long pruning. The variety is\r\ndifficult to propagate and therefore not in favor with nurserymen, and\r\nis to be had, if at all, usually at extra expense. The grapes are sweet,\r\nrich, and vinous, ranking from good to very good in quality. The fruit,\r\nhowever, should be used as soon as ripe, as it does not keep well and\r\nthe berries quickly shatter from the bunch. As an attractive early red\r\ngrape Rochester is well worth a place in the garden and possibly in\r\nfavored locations for a special market.\r\n\r\nEllwanger & Barry of Rochester, Monroe County, New York, in 1867 fruited\r\nover one hundred seedling grapes which they had raised from mixed seed\r\nof Delaware, Diana, Concord, and Rebecca. Only two of these seedlings\r\nwere finally saved, the Rochester and the Monroe. The Rochester was\r\nintroduced by the originators about 1880.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, usually hardy, medium to productive. Canes\r\n     long, intermediate in number and size, dark reddish-brown; nodes\r\n     moderately enlarged, slightly flattened; internodes short;\r\n     diaphragm thick; pith small, shoots pubescent; tendrils\r\n     intermittent, long, bifid or trifid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROCHESTER]\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds medium to below in size, short, of average thickness,\r\n     conical, open in mid-season. Young leaves tinged on upper and under\r\n     sides with dull rose-carmine. Leaves medium to large; upper surface\r\n     light green, slightly glossy, nearly smooth; lower surface\r\n     grayish-green, pubescent; veins distinct; lobes none to three with\r\n     terminus acute; petiolar sinus deep to medium, variable in width;\r\n     basal sinus absent; lateral sinus shallow to a mere notch when\r\n     present; teeth shallow, of average width. Flowers fertile, open\r\n     mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens earlier than Concord, does not always ripen evenly,\r\n     does not keep well. Clusters large to medium, about average length,\r\n     broad, tapering, usually single-shouldered but sometimes heavily\r\n     double-shouldered, very compact; peduncle short, intermediate in\r\n     thickness; pedicel short, slender, covered with few warts; brush of\r\n     medium length, slender, yellowish-brown. Berries above medium to\r\n     small, oval, dark red to purplish-red but the berries do not color\r\n     uniformly, dull, covered with thin, lilac bloom, inclined to drop\r\n     from pedicel, soft.

It is of higher quality than its parent\r\nand since it is earlier, coming with Moore Early or just after, it is\r\nworthy a place in garden collections as an early black grape. It has\r\nbeen thoroughly tested and discarded as unprofitable by commercial\r\nvineyardists probably on account of its vine characters which on our\r\ngrounds are not as good as those of Concord and would disqualify it for\r\na market variety. In appearance the fruit is much like Concord.\r\n\r\nThe variety was originated by E. W. Bull of Concord, Massachusetts, from\r\nseed of Concord. It was introduced in 1889 by George S. Josselyn of\r\nFredonia, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nROGERS' HYBRIDS.\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mag. Hort._, =23=:86. 1857. =2.= _Horticulturist_, =13=:86,\r\n     119. 1858. =3.= _Am. Pom. Soc.

Rogers of Salem, Massachusetts.[209] Rogers states that the\r\nsuggestion which started him in this work was an article by Dr. Lindley\r\nof the University of London, originally printed in the London\r\n_Horticulturist_ and reprinted in Downing's _Horticulturist_ for\r\nSeptember, 1847. This article, which is entitled \"Remarks on Hybridizing\r\nPlants,\" is a general discussion of the results of this practice so far\r\nas they were then known.\r\n\r\nThe female parent used by Rogers was a four or five year old,\r\nlarge-fruited Labrusca known locally as Carter or Mammoth Globe, and\r\nvery similar to, but not identical with Sage. The pollen for fertilizing\r\nthe blossoms of this vine was secured from vines of Black Hamburg and\r\nWhite Chasselas growing in a cold grapery near by. In the summer of\r\n1851, clusters of the Carter were fertilized with pollen from the\r\nVinifera vines both at the time of emasculation and later, and small\r\ncotton bags were tied on the blossoms to prevent the interference of\r\nforeign pollen. In addition to the repeated applications of pollen to\r\nthe stigmas, Rogers placed clusters of blossoms of the Vinifera sorts in\r\nthe enclosing sacks. As a result of these pollinations, he secured about\r\none hundred and fifty seeds which were planted in the garden that fall.\r\nIn the spring of 1852 practically every seed germinated, but cut worms\r\nand other accidents reduced the number to forty-five which finally\r\nfruited. These were left to grow on poles where they were originally\r\nplanted for three years, when, because of crowding, twenty-five of them\r\nwere removed to another part of the garden. The untransplanted vines\r\nbegan to bear fruit in 1856 and the transplanted ones a few years later.\r\nThe seedlings were numbered by Rogers from one to forty-five and for a\r\nlong time they were known under these numbers. Of these, one to five\r\ninclusive were of the Carter-Black Hamburg cross; six to fourteen\r\ninclusive were of the Carter-White Chasselas cross; and all of the\r\nnumbers from fifteen to forty-five were of Hamburg parentage. As will be\r\nnoted under Salem, this was later given a number higher than forty-five,\r\nowing to the confusion of the sort with some other after being sent out.\r\nWith this exception, the original crosses were all included in these\r\nnumbers. In 1858 and 1859, Rogers sent many of these varieties, under\r\nthe original numbers, to various people for testing. He was compelled to\r\ndo this, owing to lack of room in the half acre which comprised the\r\nRogers' garden, to properly test the sorts himself. Of this garden\r\nMarshall P. Wilder says: \"It is 150 years old; a cold matted soil,\r\nfilled with old apple and pear trees, currant bushes, flax, and\r\neverything mingled in together. It is in a close, hived up place in the\r\ncity of Salem, and it is a wonder that he ever had a bunch of grapes to\r\nshow.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this dissemination led to the confusion of some of the\r\nnumbers, a confusion which has never been satisfactorily straightened\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, No. 22, or 53, was given the name Salem. Two years later at the\r\nearnest request of a committee from the Lake Shore Grape Growers'\r\nAssociation, Rogers gave names to several of his hybrids, as listed\r\nbelow. He stated that the names selected were either those of persons\r\nnoted for scientific or literary attainments, or else of counties and\r\ntowns in Massachusetts. There was some criticism at the time from those\r\nwho thought there were other numbers as well deserving of names as\r\nthose which were so distinguished. And it must be admitted that the\r\nvines of this collection are remarkably equal in their possession of\r\ngood and bad characters. About 1870, Bush of Bushberg, Missouri,\r\nreceived three sorts as _Rogers' No. 39_. One of these which was\r\nparticularly promising, he, with Rogers' consent, named Aminia. None of\r\nthe others has ever been named, although several of them are still\r\ncultivated to a minor extent. The named varieties, with the\r\ncorresponding numbers, are as follows: 1. Goethe. 3. Massasoit. 4.\r\nWilder. 9. Lindley. 14. Gaertner. 15. Agawam. 19. Merrimac. 28. Requa.\r\n39. Aminia. 41. Essex. 43. Barry. 44. Herbert. 53 or 22. Salem (but not\r\nthe Salem now known).\r\n\r\nFor some years, many grape-growers believed that these hybrids were\r\nnothing more than seedlings of the wild Labrusca mother but it was soon\r\ngenerally accepted that they were genuine hybrids. To those who are\r\nfamiliar with Rogers' work, this was evident from the first, as the\r\nCarter or Mammoth Globe is a self-sterile sort, and the sacks enclosing\r\nthe blossoms would prevent the introduction of other pollen than that\r\nintentionally placed on the stigmas by Rogers himself. A. D. Rogers, a\r\nbrother of E. S. Rogers, in a communication to the _Horticulturist_, in\r\n1858, says that \"many of these seedlings had upright stamens,\" but of\r\nthe ones which were later named, Agawam alone is thus characterized.\r\nThis is important in considering the value of these varieties, as no\r\nvariety has ever become popular as a market sort which is self-sterile.\r\n\r\nRogers' Hybrids are unique in that the standard of excellence was so\r\nhigh in all of the forty-five seedlings produced. Some have credited\r\nthis to the manner in which he did his work and in particular to the\r\nexcess of pollen applied to the stigmas; others consider it more likely\r\ndue to his choice of parent vines. Unfortunately the evidence bearing on\r\nthis point is not sufficient to form definite conclusions.\r\n\r\nAfter the production of the seedlings mentioned above Rogers continued\r\nthe work, recrossing the varieties already produced with various\r\nVinifera varieties. None of these ever showed sufficient promise to be\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROMMEL]\r\n\r\n\r\nROMMEL.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Riparia, Vinifera.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _An.

The variety comes from Munson of Denison, Texas, and\r\nis seemingly too far removed from the warm climate in which it\r\noriginated to be profitable in New York. Besides the defects named\r\nabove, it does not attain its natural high quality in this latitude and\r\nthe grapes crack badly as they ripen. The bunch and berry are attractive\r\nin form, size and color as shown in the color-plate, though the\r\nillustration does not do justice to the size of the bunch, the season of\r\n1908, in which the fruit was produced, having been cold and wet and\r\ntherefore very unfavorable to this variety. At its best, Rommel is a\r\nvery good table grape and the authorities say makes a very fine white\r\nwine. The variety is of interest to the student of grapes from the\r\nstandpoint of its breeding, having very largely the vine characters of\r\nits maternal parent, Elvira, with somewhat better fruit. The name\r\ncommemorates the service to viticulture of Jacob Rommel of Morrison,\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\nT. V. Munson originated Rommel in 1885 and introduced it in 1889. The\r\nparents are Elvira pollinated by Triumph. Rommel was placed on the grape\r\nlist of the American Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1899.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, not always hardy, medium to productive,\r\n     susceptible to injury by leaf-hoppers.

Munson, from Texas, is a somewhat promising variety for the North\r\nfor its intrinsic value, and is certainly interesting from the\r\nstandpoint of its breeding as it gives Northern growers a grape with a\r\ngenerous admixture of Lincecumii blood. Its several essential vine\r\ncharacters are very good though it is self-sterile and needs a companion\r\nvariety which produces an abundance of pollen. Concord and Brilliant are\r\nrecommended by the originator as notable pollenizers. R. W. Munson is\r\nparticularly resistant to black-rot, making it valuable for regions\r\nwhere this fungus is a scourge. The fruit is sweet, juicy and very\r\npleasantly flavored, with tender pulp, and while not of the highest\r\nquality yet a most pleasing and particularly refreshing grape. The\r\nvariety is well worthy more extensive trial in New York.\r\n\r\nT. V. Munson of Denison, Texas, raised the original vine of R. W. Munson\r\nfrom seed of Big Berry (a variety of Post-oak) pollinated by Triumph.\r\nThe seed was planted in 1887 and the resulting variety introduced by the\r\noriginator in the fall of 1894.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, doubtfully hardy, productive, healthy. Canes medium\r\n     to nearly long, intermediate in number, thick to medium, dark red;\r\n     internodes medium to long; tendrils intermittent, bifid. Leaves\r\n     healthy.

A variety similar\r\nto this was used in particular by E. S. Rogers as the mother plant in\r\nmaking his notable crosses. They have also been used by White and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe original vine was a chance seedling found by Henry E. Sage about\r\n1811 on the banks of a small stream near Portland, Connecticut. The\r\nvariety was first brought to public notice by John Fiske Allen in 1848\r\nthrough a very laudatory description which was much criticised by those\r\nwho objected to the foxy aroma of the Sage but as warmly defended by\r\nothers who liked the foxiness. The variety was later advertised and sent\r\nout by the Shaker community at Harvard, Worcester County, Massachusetts.\r\nWithin a few years it seems to have been disseminated throughout eastern\r\nNew England, and was particularly acceptable in those sections where\r\nIsabella failed to ripen. There is no evidence that it was ever planted\r\nexcept in gardens. With the introduction of Concord and other early\r\nvarieties of higher quality the cultivation of the Sage was dropped. It\r\nis probably now obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe best description we have of Sage is the following, copied from the\r\n_United States Department of Agriculture Report_ for 1864:\r\n\r\n     \"It is much like most of the wild Fox grapes of this vicinity,\r\n     [Massachusetts] but the berries are much larger, light chestnut or\r\n     mahogany color, and they have a flattened or compressed shape,\r\n     instead of being round, frequently an inch in diameter. The bunch\r\n     is small with three to six berries in a round, ball-like cluster,\r\n     with sometimes a side stem with one berry at the end of it for a\r\n     shoulder. The stem of the bunch is not very long. The leaves\r\n     usually are 'entire' with a short pointed termination at the end of\r\n     the midrib, and two other points of the other divisions into which\r\n     all American leaves are divided, making always either plainly, or\r\n     in the rudimental state, five lobes. Thus the leaves are not much\r\n     lobed, scarcely toothed, and have a rusty, woolly appearance. The\r\n     young wood, last season's growth, is hard and wiry and covered with\r\n     bristles. The grape itself is sweet, but has a hard pulp, that some\r\n     compare to a piece of India-rubber when eating it. It is early, and\r\n     perfectly hardy, as much so as any wild grape in this vicinity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nST. LOUIS.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mo. Hort. Soc. Rpt._, =1899=:54. =2.= _Ia. Hort.

But the variety is so highly recommended in the West, especially\r\nin the states from which the above references come, that it is possibly\r\nworthy of trial in the grape regions of New York as an early type of\r\nConcord.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis was introduced by Henry Wallis of Wellston, Missouri, about\r\n1897. In 1900, he states that it is a seedling of Concord, was\r\noriginated in St. Louis, and that it had created a sensation for twenty\r\nyears in the St. Louis markets. The general character of both fruit and\r\nvine corroborates the Concord parentage though the frequently\r\nintermittent tendrils indicate there is a strain of other than Labrusca\r\nblood present.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, medium to productive.

Leaves very large to medium, variable in color, thick;\r\n     lower surface grayish-white tinged with bronze; heavily pubescent.\r\n     Flowers fertile or nearly so, open medium early; stamens upright.\r\n     Fruit ripens about with Concord, or slightly earlier, keeps and\r\n     ships well. Clusters large to medium, intermediate in length,\r\n     rather broad, usually single-shouldered but occasionally with a\r\n     double shoulder, medium to compact. Berries nearly large to medium,\r\n     roundish, dull black, covered with thick blue bloom, persistent.\r\n     Skin of average thickness and toughness.

Taking all of its characters, the variety is as close an\r\napproximation to the ideal Rogers had in mind of a European grape and an\r\nAmerican vine as any one of the score or more of his hybrids. Salem\r\nranks among the best of these hybrids for either the garden or the\r\ncommercial vineyard, and while commonly found in both it has not been\r\nsufficiently recognized by those who grow grapes for the market. It is\r\ndifficult to say why it is not more largely grown as a market fruit in\r\nNew York. The two chief faults, unproductiveness and susceptibility to\r\nmildew, are not found in all localities, and in these at least and\r\nespecially near good markets, Salem ought to take high rank as a\r\ncommercial fruit.\r\n\r\nAs compared with other hybrids of Vinifera and Labrusca, Salem is early,\r\nhardy, vigorous and fairly productive of handsome fruit of high quality\r\nboth for table and for wine-making. Though the color-plate does not show\r\nit, there is a suggestion in bunch and berry of Black Hamburg, the\r\npaternal parent. So, too, there is such a suggestion in the flavor and\r\nthe keeping quality and, as with the parent, the fruit neither cracks\r\nnor shatters and therefore ships well. To the two faults named above\r\nmust be added that of pulpiness of berry, a defect common to many\r\nhybrids of the two species represented in Salem. It is useless to\r\nrecommend for testing varieties that have been known as long and as\r\nwidely grown as Salem but it is worth while, is almost a duty, in a work\r\nof this kind to urge further trials of some of the grapes of highest\r\nquality, as Salem, on a commercial basis. Such fruit properly grown,\r\npacked, and placed in the market ought to bring remunerative prices.\r\n\r\nThis one of Rogers' hybrids is _No. 22_ of his Vinifera-Labrusca\r\ncrosses. It early attracted favorable attention from the various\r\ncultivators who had received vines from the originator for testing. It\r\nwas christened Salem by Rogers in 1867, two years earlier than his other\r\nhybrids were named. At about this time, owing to a confusion of this\r\nvariety with some other, and charges that certain parties were sending\r\nout a black grape under the name _Rogers' No. 22_, Rogers changed the\r\nnumber of Salem to 53.\r\n\r\nSalem was placed on the grape list of the American Pomological Society\r\nfruit catalog in 1869 and was removed in 1871, reinstated in 1873, and\r\nhas since been retained. It is possible that the dropping of the name\r\nfrom the catalog for the one year was a printer's oversight as there is\r\nnothing in the body of the text to indicate a reason for such action.\r\nSalem has always been one of the most popular of Rogers' hybrids and it\r\nis offered for sale to-day by practically all grape nurserymen.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to vigorous, unusually hardy, variable in\r\n     productiveness, susceptible to severe attacks of mildew.

It is the chief\r\nrepresentative of the great species _Vitis rotundifolia_, which runs\r\nriot in natural luxuriance from Delaware and Maryland to the Gulf, and\r\nwestward from the Atlantic to Arkansas and Texas. The name Scuppernong\r\nwas taken from the Indians and is now common in the geography of North\r\nCarolina; a river, a town, a lake, and a swamp all bear this\r\nappellation. Calvin Jones, an agriculturist of note in North Carolina\r\nduring the early part of the last century, gives the following history\r\nof the name as applied to the grape it now distinguishes:[211] \"This\r\ngrape & wine had the name of Scuppernong given to them by Henderson &\r\nmyself, in compliment to James Blount of Scuppernong, who first diffused\r\na general knowledge of it in several well written communications in our\r\npaper--and it is cultivated with more success on that river than in any\r\nother part of the state, perhaps, except the Island of Roanoke.\"\r\n\r\nScuppernong is said to have been found on Roanoke Island at the time of\r\nthe landing of Sir Walter Raleigh's colony. There is a tradition that an\r\nold vine now growing on this island is the original vine. At an early\r\nday it was quite common to propagate Scuppernong by seed, pulling out\r\nall vines bearing black fruit as soon as the color of the fruit could be\r\ndetermined. Because of this practice it is probable that there are many\r\nseminal varieties under the general name Scuppernong. All that seems to\r\nbe required for a grape to pass under this name is that the vine should\r\nbe a Rotundifolia and the fruit white.\r\n\r\nIn the horticultural accounts of the history of Scuppernong it is\r\ncommonly spoken of as having been found wild during the latter part of\r\nthe eighteenth century. But Lawson, writing about 1700, in the account\r\nquoted on page 37 of this work, describes with sufficient accuracy a\r\nwhite Rotundifolia which could hardly be any other than the Scuppernong.\r\nIt is, thus, in a sense, a botanical as well as a horticultural variety.\r\nIts close relationship to the black form of Rotundifolia is attested by\r\nthe fact that its seedlings are as often, probably more often, black\r\nthan white. That Scuppernong is more distinct than the other varieties\r\nof Rotundifolia is indicated by the fact that of the ten cultivated\r\nvarieties of Rotundifolia now grown in the South, James, Thomas, Eden,\r\nMeisch, Flowers, Memory, Seedlin, Tenderpulp, Jeter, and Scuppernong as\r\ngiven by Newman,[212] all are black but the last named.\r\n\r\nScuppernong vines are to be found on arbors, in gardens, or half wild,\r\non trees and fences on nearly every farm in the South Atlantic States.\r\nAs a rule, these vines receive little cultivation, are unpruned, and\r\nare given no care of any kind, but even under neglect they produce large\r\nand sure crops, are almost immune to mildew, rot, phylloxera, or other\r\nfungal or insect pests. The plants give not only an abundance of fruit\r\nbut on arbors and trellises are much prized for their shade and beauty.\r\nThe growth of the vine is prodigious; seemingly well authenticated\r\nreports state that vines are known which cover an acre of land; other\r\ntales, having at least the semblance of truth, are equally marvellous.\r\nThus there are accounts of vines of this variety over a hundred years\r\nold and which bear 500 bushels of fruit and make 2000 gallons of wine.\r\n\r\nThe fruit, to a palate accustomed to other grapes, is not very\r\nacceptable, having a musky flavor and a somewhat repugnant odor, which,\r\nhowever, becomes with familiarity, it is said, quite agreeable. The pulp\r\nis sweet and juicy but is lacking in sprightliness. From the Scuppernong\r\nare made several very good wines and it would seem that the future of\r\nthis and other varieties of Rotundifolia, from a commercial standpoint,\r\nlies largely in their value for wine. Quite aside from the quality of\r\nthe fruit as a table grape, they are not suitable for the market from\r\nthe fact that the berries drop from the bunch in ripening and become\r\nmore or less smeared with juice so that as they are brought into market\r\nin quantity, their appearance is not at all appetizing.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to rank, not hardy in the North, very productive.\r\n     Canes long, numerous, slender, vary from ash-gray to grayish-brown;\r\n     surface smooth, thickly covered with small, light brown dots; pith\r\n     greenish; tendrils intermittent, simple.

Flowers open very late; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens late, even in the South, often ripening unevenly,\r\n     appears to keep well but berries drop as they mature.

Nevertheless it has\r\nmany excellent qualities as an amateur grape and should not be lost to\r\ncultivation. The fact that it is the result of the fecundation of a\r\nRiparia by a Vinifera, both parents being excellent varieties, gives\r\nSecretary added interest and value and makes its perpetuation still\r\nfurther worth while.\r\n\r\nThere is no question as to the rank of the fruit characters of\r\nSecretary. Taken together they make it a grape of exceptionally high\r\nquality, the berries being meaty yet juicy, fine-grained and tender with\r\na sweet, spicy, vinous flavor. The bunches are large, well formed with\r\nmedium-sized, purplish-black berries covered with thick bloom, making a\r\nvery handsome cluster. While the vine and foliage somewhat resemble\r\nthose of Clinton, one of its parents, the variety is not nearly as\r\nhardy, vigorous or productive nor as healthy, falling short in all of\r\nthese respects and making its culture in New York precarious. Moreover,\r\nin any but favored localities in this State, its maturity is somewhat\r\nuncertain. These defects of vine have kept Secretary from becoming of\r\ncommercial importance and make it of value only to the amateur.\r\n\r\nSecretary is one of the first productions of Ricketts of Newburgh. He\r\ngrew the original vine from seed of Clinton fertilized by Muscat\r\nHamburg. Planted in 1867, it is said to have borne a little fruit when\r\none year old from the seed. Specimens of the variety were exhibited\r\nbefore the American Pomological Society in 1871. Ricketts sold the\r\nvariety about 1875 to S. W. Underhill of Croton Point, New York, who\r\nintroduced it a few years later. On account of its many weak points it\r\nhas never been popular and it is apparently not offered for sale by any\r\nof the nurserymen to-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENASQUA]\r\n\r\n     Vine not uniform in vigor, doubtfully hardy, quite variable in\r\n     productiveness, inclined to be an uncertain bearer, subject to\r\n     attacks of fungi.

The merits and demerits of the cross-breeds\r\nof these two species are so similar in the varieties of them now in\r\ncultivation that they can be placed in a group having as few variations\r\nas can be found in the parent species. The characters of these hybrid\r\ngrapes have been well discussed in writing of the varieties sent out by\r\nRogers and the place of Senasqua is well designated when the statement\r\nis made that it is very similar to Rogers' hybrids. The vine lacks\r\nsomewhat in vigor, hardiness, productiveness and health. The grapes are\r\nof good quality and when well grown the variety is up to the average of\r\nsuch hybrids in fruit characters so far as the palate is concerned.\r\nUnfortunately the berries have a tendency to crack which is aggravated\r\nby the fact that the bunches are so compact as to crowd the berries and\r\nthus add to the cracking. Senasqua is one of the latest to open its buds\r\nand is therefore seldom injured by late frosts. This variety is hardly\r\nas well adapted for commercial viticulture as several other such hybrids\r\nand can be recommended only for the garden for the sake of variety.\r\n\r\nStephen W. Underhill of Croton Point, New York, originated Senasqua from\r\nseed of Concord pollinated by Black Prince. The seed was planted in 1863\r\nand the resulting variety introduced about 1870. This variety, although\r\nit attracted much attention at the time of its introduction, was never\r\npopular. It was rather widely tested but was soon dropped and is to-day\r\npractically obsolete. The foliage and vines of Senasqua show little\r\ntrace of Vinifera but the descent from the foreign species is plainly\r\nmarked in the fruit.\r\n\r\n     Vine variable in vigor, sometimes weak and tender, medium to\r\n     unproductive, somewhat susceptible to attacks of mildew. Canes\r\n     short, few in number, above average size, light to dark\r\n     reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes short to\r\n     medium; diaphragm thick; pith of medium size; shoots slightly\r\n     pubescent; tendrils intermittent, long to medium, trifid to bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds below average size, short, of medium thickness, conical,\r\n     open very late, tinged on under side and slightly along margin of\r\n     upper side with light rose-carmine. Leaves intermediate in size and\r\n     thickness, light green, slightly glossy, medium to somewhat rugose;\r\n     lower surface whitish-green, pubescent; veins distinct; leaf\r\n     usually not lobed with terminus acute; petiolar sinus of average\r\n     depth, medium to narrow; basal and lateral sinuses shallow and\r\n     narrow when present; teeth intermediate in depth and width. Flowers\r\n     fertile, open late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens a little later than Concord, keeps well. Clusters\r\n     large to medium, intermediate in length, broad to medium,\r\n     irregularly tapering, usually with a small single shoulder, very\r\n     compact with uneven surface; peduncle short to medium, thick;\r\n     pedicel intermediate in length, thick, usually smooth, enlarged at\r\n     point of attachment to fruit; brush short to medium, green with\r\n     slight red tinge. Berries above medium in size, roundish,\r\n     reddish-black to black, covered with heavy blue bloom, persistent,\r\n     firm. Skin medium to thick, tender, inclined to crack, adheres\r\n     strongly to the pulp, contains a fair amount of light wine-colored\r\n     pigment, without astringency. Flesh greenish, translucent, very\r\n     juicy, tender, meaty, vinous, somewhat spicy, sprightly, good in\r\n     quality. Seeds separate readily from the pulp, one to five, average\r\n     two, intermediate in size, rather long, narrow, usually one-sided,\r\n     light brown; raphe buried in a narrow groove; chalaza small, above\r\n     center, oval, obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELBY.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Riparia.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Vineyardist_, Oct. 15, 1893. =2.= _Rural N.

It ripens at a time when\r\nthere are many other grapes which surpass it in flavor and appearance.\r\nIt has, however, been somewhat highly spoken of and grape experimenters\r\nmay want to try the variety. The name is from Shelby, Ohio, the\r\nbirthplace of the originator.\r\n\r\nD. S. Marvin of Watertown, New York, originated the Shelby about 1880.\r\nIt was introduced in the fall of 1894. The originator writes that the\r\nparentage of this variety is not positively known but it is supposed to\r\nbe a Labrusca-Riparia cross. The botanical characters of the fruit and\r\nvine as it grows on the Station grounds verify this supposition.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, variable in hardiness, medium to productive. Canes\r\n     long, numerous, medium to slender; tendrils intermittent, sometimes\r\n     continuous, bifid to trifid. Leaves uniform in size, green, often\r\n     thin; lower surface grayish-green with tinge of bronze, strongly\r\n     pubescent. Flowers fertile or nearly so, open in mid-season or\r\n     earlier; stamens upright. Fruit ripens early, sometimes before\r\n     Winchell, does not keep nor ship well. Clusters medium to below in\r\n     size, short, frequently with a single shoulder, shorter and more\r\n     compact than Winchell. Berries medium to small, roundish, light\r\n     green to yellowish-green, covered with thin gray bloom, somewhat\r\n     inclined to shatter. Skin thin, variable in toughness, peculiarly\r\n     astringent. Flesh tough, stringy, foxy, sweet from skin to center,\r\n     mild, fair to good in quality. Seeds do not separate readily from\r\n     the pulp, not very numerous, medium to below in size, short, broad,\r\n     plump.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera, Bourquiniana?)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Kan.

The variety\r\nseems to be thought highly of in the West and it is possible that it has\r\ngreater value there than in New York. The quality of the grape is high\r\nand it is said to make a light-colored wine of good body, taste and\r\naroma, but taking it all and all it does not rise above mediocre and\r\ncannot be recommended unless for trial.\r\n\r\nThe variety was originated by John Burr of Leavenworth, Kansas, from\r\nseed of Delaware planted about 1874. It was introduced in 1887 by\r\nStayman & Black of Leavenworth, Kansas. There are few characters of\r\neither vine or fruit that show evidence of having come from Delaware.\r\n\r\n     Vine variable in vigor, usually hardy in ordinary seasons,\r\n     productive. Canes short to medium, few in number, rather slender;\r\n     tendrils continuous to intermittent, bifid to trifid. Leaves not\r\n     very healthy, medium to small, moderately light green; lower\r\n     surface tinged with bronze, pubescent. Flowers partly fertile, open\r\n     in mid-season; stamens upright. Fruit ripens about with Concord,\r\n     usually keeps fairly well. Clusters not uniform in size, short,\r\n     frequently with a small single shoulder, compact to medium. Berries\r\n     small to above medium, roundish, very dark reddish-black covered\r\n     with a large amount of lilac bloom, sometimes shatter considerably\r\n     from pedicel. Skin thin, rather tender. Flesh unusually pale green,\r\n     somewhat stringy, vinous, tender, sweet from skin to center, good\r\n     in quality. Seeds slightly adherent, medium to small, intermediate\r\n     in width; chalaza oval, often distinctly above center.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARK-STAR.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera, Aestivalis.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _National Nur._, =10=:128, 133. 1902. =2.= _Rural N.

On the Station grounds it ripens after Catawba, which does not\r\nalways mature. If the variety fulfills the high expectations of it in\r\nthe region of its origin it is worthy a trial in the regions of this\r\nState where the Catawba ripens.\r\n\r\nThe variety was originated by Joseph Bachman of Altus, Arkansas, from\r\nseed of Catawba fertilized by Norton or Hermann. The seed was planted\r\nabout 1892. Stark-Star was introduced by Stark Brothers, of Louisiana,\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes medium to short,\r\n     numerous, often slender, roughened; tendrils continuous to\r\n     intermittent, bifid to trifid. Leaves large to medium, dark green,\r\n     frequently thin; lower surface pale green, slightly pubescent,\r\n     cobwebby. Fruit ripens later than Catawba, appears to be an\r\n     excellent keeper. Clusters large, medium to long, inclined to\r\n     broadness, frequently with a well marked short single shoulder,\r\n     very compact. Berries medium to below in size, oval to roundish but\r\n     frequently compressed on account of compactness of cluster, black\r\n     when ripe, covered with blue bloom, persistent. Skin intermediate\r\n     in thickness, tender. Flesh pale green, not very juicy, tough and\r\n     solid, slightly aromatic and spicy, almost sweet, fair to good in\r\n     quality. Seeds adhere somewhat to the pulp, numerous, medium to\r\n     small, intermediate in length and width, plump; raphe shows as a\r\n     distinct cord; chalaza distinctly above center to nearly central.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPERB.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera, Aestivalis.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Am.

It resembles Eumelan, the reputed\r\nparent, in size, shape, and color but is not as attractive. The vine on\r\nthe Station grounds is not such as to recommend it highly, and since it\r\nhas been known for at least twenty years without having become at all\r\npopular with grape-growers, it may be assumed that the grape has\r\nweaknesses elsewhere as well as here.\r\n\r\nA. F. Rice of Griswoldville, Georgia, originated this variety, it is\r\nsaid, from seed of Eumelan. The seed was planted in 1880 near South\r\nWeymouth, Massachusetts.

Leaves healthy,\r\n     medium to large, moderately light green; lower surface\r\n     grayish-green, thinly pubescent, the pubescence being distributed\r\n     in flecks. Flowers strongly self-fertile, open in mid-season or\r\n     later; stamens upright. Fruit ripens before Concord, keeps and\r\n     ships well.

TAYLOR BULLIT (13, 14). TAYLOR'S BULLITT (8, 11).\r\n     _Taylor's Bullitt_ (12).\r\n\r\nTaylor is hardly known in New York nor, indeed, is it now much grown\r\nelsewhere. It is of interest for the part it has played in the grape\r\nculture of the past and especially for its worthy offspring. Many of\r\nthese now outrank the parent in the regions and for the purposes for\r\nwhich Taylor is grown. In truth, the most valuable quality of Taylor\r\nseems to be its capacity for transmitting its good characters to its\r\nseedlings; some of course fall much below it, as a table or wine grape,\r\nbut a considerable number quite equal it, and a few surpass it, but all\r\nresemble the parent vine much more than is common among grapes. While it\r\nis from the species to which Taylor belongs that we must look for our\r\nhardiest vines yet this grape and its offspring, though not particularly\r\ntender to cold, do best in southern regions as they require a long, warm\r\nsummer and fall to mature properly. Taylor was long grown in both Europe\r\nand California as a grafting stock for the Old World varieties as a\r\nprotection against phylloxera, and is still somewhat cultivated in these\r\nregions for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the fruit of Taylor is from fair to good, the flavor\r\nbeing sweet, pure, delicate and spicy and the flesh tender and juicy,\r\nbut the bunches are small, the flowers infertile so that the berries do\r\nnot set well and give very imperfect and unsightly clusters. The skin is\r\nsuch, too, that it cracks badly, a defect that is seemingly transmitted\r\nto many of the seedlings of the variety. The vine is strong, healthy,\r\nhardy but not very productive. Taylor is essentially a wine grape, and\r\nit is not likely that it or many of the varieties bred from it will make\r\ntable grapes. The wine is said to be exceptionally good, of great body\r\nand high flavor.\r\n\r\nThe original vine of Taylor was a wild seedling found in the early part\r\nof the last century on the Cumberland Mountains near the\r\nKentucky-Tennessee line by a Mr. Cobb who planted the vine on his farm\r\nin Shelby County, Kentucky. Later the farm was sold to Cuthbert Bullitt.\r\nAbout 1840, the grape came to the attention of Judge John Taylor of\r\nJericho, Henry County, Kentucky, an enthusiastic amateur horticulturist\r\nwho secured the vine from Bullitt and sent cuttings to many\r\ngrape-growers for testing. It was early introduced into the grape region\r\nof the middle West where it was widely tested but was never extensively\r\nplanted owing to its lack of productiveness. Its culture has been on the\r\nwane for many years and only an occasional nurseryman in that section\r\nhandles the variety to-day. This variety has, at different times, passed\r\nunder the names Bullitt, Taylor, Taylor's Bullitt, with various\r\nspellings of the name Bullitt.\r\n\r\nThe following description has been compiled from various sources:\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to rank, healthy, hardy, variable in productiveness.\r\n     Leaves small, attractive in color, smooth. Flowers bloom early;\r\n     stamens reflexed. Fruit ripens about two weeks before Isabella.\r\n     Clusters small to medium, shouldered, loose to moderately compact.\r\n     Berries small to medium, roundish, pale greenish-white, sometimes\r\n     tinged with amber.

Its most remarkable character is\r\ncompact, well shouldered bunches, making them attractive in appearance\r\nthough somewhat small for a commercial variety. Telegraph is susceptible\r\nto rot and the birds are particularly fond of its fruit. It ripens very\r\nearly and is of better quality than Hartford--not high praise. The\r\nvariety is peculiar in that the ripening season seems to vary from a\r\nfew days after Hartford to as late as Concord. It is earlier,\r\ncomparatively, in the South than in the North; that is, in cool summers\r\nit matures slowly.\r\n\r\nTelegraph, or Christine, as it appears to have first been called, is a\r\nchance seedling which appeared about the middle of the last century in\r\nthe yard of a Mr. Christine, Hestonville, near Westchester, Chester\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania. About 1860 P. R. Freas, editor of the _Germantown\r\nTelegraph_, to whom fruit was sent, bestowed upon it the name of his\r\npaper, which finally supplanted the original name. It was placed on the\r\ngrape list of the American Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1869 and\r\nremoved in 1899. Telegraph is apparently a Labrusca with a strain of\r\nAestivalis.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, usually healthy, very productive. Canes\r\n     unusually long, medium to numerous; tendrils continuous, trifid to\r\n     bifid.

Fruit usually\r\n     ripens soon after Hartford but sometimes later, a fair shipper and\r\n     keeper. Clusters medium to small, often short, broad, cylindrical,\r\n     blunt at ends, single-shouldered, very compact. Berries\r\n     intermediate in size, roundish to slightly oval on account of\r\n     compactness of cluster, dull black covered with a large amount of\r\n     blue bloom, persistent.

Beside duplicating the Catawba in\r\nfruit the vines are not healthy, being very susceptible to mildew and\r\nrot, the fruit drops badly, and the crop does not ripen well. The\r\nquality of the fruit is very good, once it can be secured. A point in\r\nits favor is that it ripens a little before Catawba. The variety long\r\nsince ceased to be of commercial importance and can now be found but\r\nrarely in collections.\r\n\r\nTo-Kalon was originated in the early part of the last century by Dr.\r\nSpofford of Lansingburg, New York. The originator states that it is a\r\nseedling of a European grape, but from its resemblance to Catawba it is\r\nsupposed by many to have been a seedling of that variety. Wyman and\r\nCarter are two varieties of later introduction which are said to be\r\nidentical with To-Kalon, but as the origin of each is apparently\r\nauthentic and distinct it appears more probable that they are merely\r\nsimilar sorts. To-Kalon was placed on the list of sorts recommended by\r\nthe American Pomological Society in 1862 but was dropped from this list\r\nin 1871.\r\n\r\nThe following description has been compiled from various sources:\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to rank, variable in productiveness, hardy, often\r\n     mildews badly. Foliage large, abundant. Flowers do not always set\r\n     well. Fruit ripens somewhat earlier than Catawba. Clusters large,\r\n     shouldered.

When\r\nat its best it is a magnificent bunch of golden grapes of highest\r\nquality, esteemed even in southern Europe where it must compete with the\r\nbest of the Viniferas, though unfortunately it is nearly as susceptible\r\nin that region to phylloxera as the Old World varieties, a defect which\r\nhas caused its relegation there from commercial vineyards to the\r\ncollections of experimenters and amateurs. In America its commercial\r\nimportance is curtailed by the fact that it requires a long season for\r\nits proper development and the variety justifies its name only in the\r\nSouth and more particularly in the Southwest. In the latitude of New\r\nYork it is doubtfully hardy and the short summer season never permits it\r\nto attain the quality and beauty which characterize it further south.\r\n\r\nTriumph has, in general, the vine characters of the Labrusca parent\r\nConcord, especially its habit of growth, vigor, productiveness and\r\nfoliage characters, falling short in hardiness, resistance to fungal\r\ndiseases and earliness of maturity. Even in New York the vines are as\r\nvigorous and set nearly as much fruit as Concord; but they are injured\r\nin cold winters unless protected, and suffer in particular from the\r\nmildews. The fruit matures with or a little later than the Catawba. It\r\nproves, in regions where it is largely grown, to be quite adaptable to\r\ndifferent soils and locations and the small amount of data at hand on\r\nthis point in New York suggests that this adaptability holds for the\r\ngrape regions of this State as well. It prefers, if anything, a deep\r\nsoil to a shallow one and alluvial or clayey soils to lighter lands.\r\n\r\nWhile the vine characters of Triumph are those of Labrusca there is\r\nscarcely a suggestion of the coarseness, or of the foxy odor and taste\r\nof Labrusca; and the objectionable seeds, pulp, and skin of the native\r\ngrape give way to the far less objectionable structures of Vinifera.\r\nGrapes of this variety do not have the firm and often disagreeable\r\npulpiness of many other similar hybrids, as for instance most of Rogers'\r\nhybrids. The flesh is tender and melting and the flavor rich, sweet,\r\nvinous, pure and delicate, giving the variety high rank among the best\r\nAmerican grapes. In the North, as would be expected from its lack of\r\nproper maturity, the flavor is insipid as compared with the same\r\ncharacter in the South. The skins of the berries are faulty being more\r\napparent in eating than those of Vinifera and under unfavorable\r\nconditions crack badly; because of the tenderness of the skin the\r\nvariety neither ships nor keeps remarkably well. Triumph is not only one\r\nof the best dessert grapes but it is said to make a very good white\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRIUMPH]\r\n\r\nThere are numerous pure-bred and cross-bred offsprings of Triumph in\r\nAmerica which indicate that this variety may be very successfully used\r\nin grape-breeding. Munson of Texas, in particular, among other\r\nviticulturists, has used it to advantage in breeding work, his Bailey,\r\nBig Extra, Big Hope, Carman, Early Golden, Fern Munson, Governor Ross,\r\nNewman, Ragan, Rommel, R. W. Munson, W. B. Munson, all having been bred\r\nwith Triumph as an ancestor.\r\n\r\nWhen all of its qualities and characters are considered, and for all\r\nparts of America, it can hardly be disputed that Triumph is the best of\r\nthe hybrids of the two species from which it comes that has been\r\nproduced by artificial fertilization. That it does not succeed better in\r\nNew York is a distinct loss to the viticulture of the State.\r\n\r\nTriumph was originated nearly a half century ago by George W. Campbell\r\nof Delaware, Ohio, from seed of Concord fertilized by Chasselas Musque\r\n(Joslyn's St. Albans). The originator considered it of no value in his\r\nvineyard but sent it to Samuel Miller of Bluffton, Missouri, who gave it\r\nthe name Triumph. It was placed on the grape list of the American\r\nPomological Society fruit catalog in 1883.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, doubtfully hardy, medium to very productive,\r\n     somewhat subject to attacks of mildew. Canes medium to long,\r\n     intermediate in number and thickness, moderately dark brown,\r\n     surface covered with a slight amount of bloom; nodes enlarged,\r\n     variable in shape; internodes medium to above in length; diaphragm\r\n     thick; pith medium in size; shoots slightly pubescent; tendrils\r\n     intermittent, medium to long, trifid, sometimes bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds large to medium, long and thick, obtuse to conical, open\r\n     late.

The vines usually set too much fruit in spite of efforts\r\nto control the crop by pruning, and two undesirable results follow: The\r\nbunches are small and the vines, lacking vigor at best, fail to fully\r\nrecover from the over-fruitfulness. Over-productiveness and lack of\r\nvigor are the two defects in Ulster that have kept it from becoming of\r\nmore importance commercially and a greater favorite as a garden grape.\r\nThe quality of the fruit is very good, being much like that of Catawba\r\nboth in flesh characters and in flavor. The color of the berries seems\r\nto vary greatly, sometimes being nearly as red as Catawba and under\r\nother conditions an unattractive green with a reddish tinge. As a rule\r\nthe fruit keeps well but there are exceptions especially when the\r\nvariety is not grown under the conditions best suited to it. Ulster has\r\nmany good qualities but its deficiency in vigor and capriciousness in\r\nboth vine and fruit characters prevent its becoming a grape of value for\r\neither vineyard or garden.\r\n\r\nUlster was originated by A. J. Caywood of Marlboro, New York, and was\r\nintroduced by the originator about 1885. It was included in the list of\r\nsorts recommended by the American Pomological Society in 1899. Its\r\nparents are said to be Catawba pollinated by a wild Aestivalis. Both\r\nvine and fruit show unmistakable traces of Labrusca and Vinifera, but\r\nthe Aestivalis characters, if present, are not apparent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ULSTER]\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to weak, usually hardy, productive, often overbears,\r\n     sometimes susceptible to attacks of mildew.

It ripens somewhat\r\nlate and quite unevenly. It might prove of some value in breeding for\r\nthe characters for which, even among the largest and most vigorous\r\ngrapes of to-day, it is distinguished.\r\n\r\nThis variety was originated by the Shakers at Union Village, Warren\r\nCounty, Ohio. It was introduced by Nicholas Longworth of Cincinnati\r\nabout the middle of the last century. In 1858 it was placed on the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society's list of grapes that promise well and in\r\n1862 was placed on the regular list of recommended sorts. Here it\r\nremained until 1883, when it was dropped. Ontario, another grape of this\r\ntype, which was originated by W. H. Read of Port Dalhousie, Ontario, was\r\nconsidered by many synonymous with Union Village but the evidence seems\r\nto show that, though very similar, it had a distinct origin. Union\r\nVillage is said to be a seedling of Isabella. The characters generally\r\nindicate Labrusca although the lobing of the leaves and the\r\nsusceptibility to fungi may indicate a strain of Vinifera.\r\n\r\nThe following description has been compiled from various sources:\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous to rank, usually productive, somewhat tender, subject\r\n     to attacks of fungi.

One of the most valuable attributes of Vergennes is that\r\nit seldom fails to bear a crop though it has a tendency to overbear\r\nwhich causes it to be variable in size of fruits and in time of\r\nripening; with a moderate crop it ripens with Concord but with a heavy\r\nload of grapes the crop matures from one to two weeks later. Vergennes\r\nis somewhat unpopular with vineyardists because of the sprawling habit\r\nof the vine making a vineyard of this grape untractable for vineyard\r\noperations. This fault is obviated somewhat by grafting it on other\r\nvines. In some of the grape regions of New York the vines are\r\nprecariously hardy though tenderness to cold can hardly be said to be a\r\nserious fault of the variety.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the fruit is attractive and while the quality is not\r\nhigh, yet it is good; the flavor is agreeable, the flesh is tender and\r\nseeds and skin are not objectionable. Considering all of its fruit\r\ncharacters, Vergennes may be said to be more than an ordinary\r\ngrape--much better than several better known commercial varieties. The\r\nvariety is somewhat remarkable in being probably the best shipper and\r\nthe best keeper among the pure Labrusca varieties. Nearly all of the\r\ngrapes which ship and keep well have more or less Vinifera blood, but if\r\nVergennes has any foreign blood it shows it only in its keeping and\r\nshipping qualities. At present Vergennes is the standard late-keeping\r\ngrape for this region being very commonly found in the markets as late\r\nas January and sometimes February. A number of seedlings of Vergennes,\r\npure-bred and cross-bred, growing on the Station grounds, show that this\r\nvariety transmits its characters well to its offspring indicating that\r\nit has value for grape-breeding. Vergennes may be recommended for its\r\nintrinsic value for the vineyard and the garden and to the experimenter\r\nas one of the best pure Labruscas for the production of new and improved\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nThe original vine of this variety was a chance seedling found in the\r\ngarden of William E. Greene, Vergennes, Vermont. It fruited for the\r\nfirst time in 1874. It was placed on the list of sorts recommended by\r\nthe American Pomological Society in 1883 and is still retained.\r\n\r\n     Vine variable in vigor, not always hardy, medium to very productive\r\n     depending upon amount of winter injury, usually healthy. Canes long\r\n     to medium, intermediate in number and size, dark dull brown; nodes\r\n     enlarged, strongly flattened; internodes of average length;\r\n     diaphragm thick; pith medium in thickness; shoots pubescent;\r\n     tendrils continuous, long to medium, bifid or sometimes trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds large to medium, long, thick; open very late. Young\r\n     leaves tinged on under side and along margin of upper side with\r\n     rose-carmine. Leaves large to medium, thin; upper surface light\r\n     green, glossy, somewhat rugose; lower surface pale green, very\r\n     pubescent; veins indistinct; leaf usually not lobed with terminus\r\n     broadly acute; petiolar sinus of average depth, medium to wide;\r\n     teeth shallow, often wide. Flowers nearly sterile, open in\r\n     mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit variable in season but usually ripens one to two weeks later\r\n     than Concord, keeps and ships well. Clusters intermediate in size\r\n     and length, broad, cylindrical to tapering, sometimes\r\n     single-shouldered, variable in compactness but inclined to be\r\n     loose; peduncle short to medium, thick; pedicel intermediate in\r\n     length and thickness, covered with numerous small warts, enlarged\r\n     at point of attachment to fruit; brush slender, short, pale green.\r\n     Berries large to below medium, oval to roundish, light and dark\r\n     red, covered with lilac bloom, persistent, medium in firmness.

In particular it resembles\r\nHayes but does not equal it, being of poorer quality and having smaller\r\nand less attractive fruits; neither does it equal Martha. Victoria is\r\nmarked by having more foxiness in flavor than do most of the white\r\nseedlings of Concord. In view of the many good green grapes, there is\r\nlittle about Victoria to recommend it,--there are many commonplace\r\ngrapes of its color and season quite its equal.\r\n\r\nThis variety was originated by T. B. Miner of Linden, Union County, New\r\nJersey, about 1871.\r\n\r\n     Vine of medium vigor, usually hardy, productive, subject to attacks\r\n     of mildew in unfavorable locations. Canes medium to short, not\r\n     numerous, slender; tendrils continuous, trifid to bifid. Leaves\r\n     medium in size, dark green; lower surface pale green with tinge of\r\n     bronze, covered with short down. Flowers nearly fertile, open in\r\n     mid-season; stamens upright. Fruit ripens about with Concord, does\r\n     not keep well. Clusters average in size, long, inclined to slender,\r\n     often single-shouldered, compact. Berries intermediate in size,\r\n     roundish, light green with pale yellow tinge, covered with thin\r\n     gray bloom, persistent. Skin thin, tender. Flesh pale green,\r\n     slightly tough, foxy, sweet at skin to acid at center, good in\r\n     quality. Seeds do not separate readily from the pulp, medium to\r\n     below in size, of average width and length.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALTER.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca, Bourquiniana.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mag.

But stunted by fungi\r\nwhich nearly every year attack leaves, young wood and fruit, it is only\r\npossible in exceptionally favorable seasons to produce a crop of grapes\r\nwith this variety. Not infrequently the attacks of mildew are so severe\r\nthat the vines are defoliated before mid-season. Besides its\r\nsusceptibility to cryptogamic diseases the variety is fastidious as to\r\nsoils and even in localities to which it seems adapted it is variable in\r\ngrowth. While not to be classed among the tender grapes yet it is\r\ninjured in severe winters, and is almost certain to suffer some injury\r\nafter defoliation by fungi. There are several reports at hand which seem\r\nto show that it is hardier and more vigorous on the roots of hardy,\r\nstrong-growing varieties.\r\n\r\nAs if to atone for the faults of the vine the fruit of Walter is almost\r\nperfect, lacking only in the size of bunch and berry. The bunch and\r\nberry resemble Delaware, one of its parents, while it has the peculiar\r\nflavor of Diana, the other parent. Well grown, the fruit is more\r\nattractive than that of Delaware but it cannot be said that the quality\r\nis quite the equal of that of either of its parents. It does not have\r\nthe fault of ripening its berries unevenly, one of the defects which\r\ndebars Diana from profitable cultivation. Though more fastidious, Walter\r\nis usually adapted to conditions under which Delaware thrives. The\r\nvariety has been cultivated for nearly half a century but is seemingly\r\nless and less grown, a fact to be regretted; for there are few American\r\ngrapes of more exquisite flavor and aroma and more dainty appearance. It\r\nis said that when protected from dew by walls or other shelter the vines\r\nare not so badly attacked by fungi, if at all, and that Walter may thus\r\nbe grown to perfection. If this be true grape-lovers should see that the\r\nvariety is long retained in collections and for the garden.\r\n\r\nA. J. Caywood originated this variety about 1850 from seed of Delaware\r\npollinated by Diana. It was placed on the grape list of the American\r\nPomological Society fruit catalog in 1871. Walter is still to be found\r\nin an occasional varietal vineyard but it is seldom offered for sale by\r\nnurserymen.\r\n\r\n     Vine moderately vigorous, not hardy in exposed locations, variable\r\n     in productiveness, subject to attacks of fungi. Canes medium to\r\n     above in length and size, dark reddish-brown, surface covered with\r\n     thin blue bloom; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes medium to\r\n     above in length; diaphragm thick; pith of fair size; shoots\r\n     pubescent; tendrils intermittent, medium to above in length, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds small, intermediate in length and thickness, pointed to\r\n     conical. Foliage of average size, thick; upper surface dark green,\r\n     glossy, smooth; lower surface tinged with bronze, heavily\r\n     pubescent; lobes none to three with terminus acute; petiolar sinus\r\n     of average depth, narrow to medium; basal sinus lacking; lateral\r\n     sinus usually a notch if present; teeth intermediate in depth and\r\n     width. Flowers open in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit somewhat variable in season of ripening, averaging about with\r\n     Delaware, keeps and ships well. Clusters medium in size and length,\r\n     broad, cylindrical to tapering, usually single-shouldered, compact;\r\n     peduncle short to medium, of average thickness; pedicel medium in\r\n     length, slender, covered with small scattering warts; brush short,\r\n     slender, green with brownish tinge. Berries small to medium, often\r\n     strongly ovate, red, much like Delaware, glossy, covered with a\r\n     moderate amount of lilac bloom, persistent, firm. Skin intermediate\r\n     in thickness, very tough, adheres but slightly to the pulp,\r\n     contains no pigment, without astringency. Flesh pale green,\r\n     translucent, juicy, tough, somewhat foxy, vinous, quite strongly\r\n     aromatic, sweet next the skin to tart at center, good to very good\r\n     in quality. Seeds do not separate easily from the pulp, one to\r\n     four, average three, below medium in size and length, intermediate\r\n     in width, medium to sharp-pointed, light brown; raphe obscure;\r\n     chalaza large, above center, irregularly circular, distinct.

Rpt._, =1905=:302.\r\n\r\nThough there are many qualities to commend Wapanuka, yet it is not as\r\npopular in the North as was expected it would become at the time of its\r\nintroduction. The chief reason for its failure is that it does not ship\r\nwell, seemingly a prime requisite for a commercial grape in New York,\r\nthough the markets are seldom far distant. It is probable, too, that the\r\nflavor is not quite as high in this latitude as in the South, or it may\r\nbe that the grapes with which we compare it here are better flavored\r\nthan in the South. At any rate it does not have the comparatively high\r\nquality in New York that it is reported to have elsewhere, being too\r\ninsipid. There is a tendency, too, for the grapes to shatter. The fruits\r\nwhen well grown are attractive and the quality is from fair to good.\r\nWapanuka is worthy a trial in commercial vineyards; and because of the\r\nhandsome appearance and distinct flavor of the fruit it deserves a place\r\nin the garden.\r\n\r\nMunson of Texas, originated Wapanuka from seed of Rommel fertilized by\r\nBrilliant. It was introduced by the originator in the fall of 1898.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, usually hardy, productive. Canes medium to short,\r\n     intermediate in number and size, dark reddish-brown, often with\r\n     ash-gray tinge; tendrils continuous, bifid to trifid. Leaves large,\r\n     moderately light green, somewhat rugose on older leaves; lower\r\n     surface dull green tinged with bronze, pubescent. Flowers fertile\r\n     or nearly so, open before mid-season; stamens upright. Fruit ripens\r\n     about with Concord, does not keep well. Clusters intermediate in\r\n     size, long to medium, frequently with a long-peduncled single\r\n     shoulder, compact. Berries large, roundish, very pale\r\n     yellowish-green, covered with thin gray bloom, with a tendency to\r\n     shatter, soft. Skin covered with few, small, dark dots, very thin\r\n     and tender. Flesh unusually pale green, tender, somewhat foxy,\r\n     sweet and mild, good in quality. Seeds separate easily from the\r\n     pulp, intermediate in size, broad, distinctly notched, short.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE IMPERIAL.\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca, Bourquiniana.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Mo. Hort.

The\r\noriginator thought it one of the most valuable, if not the most\r\nvaluable, of his white grapes. As the variety grows in the Station\r\nvineyard the fruit is neither especially attractive in appearance nor of\r\nvery high quality though better in the latter respect than the average.\r\nWhite Imperial is one of a somewhat large number of offspring of\r\nDutchess now known to viticulture in which the good qualities of the\r\nparent have been transmitted in a large measure to the progeny. White\r\nBeauty, described in the next chapter, is of the same parentage and is\r\nsimilar in general characters of vine and fruit, though berries and\r\nbunches are a little larger and the vines a little more vigorous. White\r\nImperial was introduced with great expectations in the West, but,\r\nespecially in the vineyards of Missouri, while still grown somewhat is\r\nnot holding its own with better known grapes of its class.\r\n\r\nWhite Imperial was produced by Dr. J. Stayman of Leavenworth, Kansas,\r\nfrom seed of Dutchess. The variety was introduced about twenty-five\r\nyears ago by Stayman & Black.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to very vigorous, hardy, variable in productiveness,\r\n     susceptible to attacks of fungi under unfavorable conditions. Canes\r\n     intermediate in length, rather numerous, inclined to slender;\r\n     tendrils continuous to intermittent, bifid to trifid. Leaves above\r\n     average size, intermediate in color and thickness; lower surface\r\n     pale green, often with considerable pubescence, slightly cobwebby.\r\n     Flowers partly sterile, open early; stamens upright. Fruit ripens\r\n     about a week before Delaware, keeps well. Clusters variable in\r\n     size, intermediate in length, slender, frequently\r\n     single-shouldered, variable in compactness. Berries medium to\r\n     small, oval to roundish, light green, sometimes with a yellow\r\n     tinge, covered with thin gray bloom, persistent. Skin sprinkled\r\n     with reddish-brown dots, thin, tender, without astringency. Flesh\r\n     pale green, fine-grained, tough, sweet at skin to agreeably tart at\r\n     center, somewhat sprightly, good to best in quality.

The berries when fully ripe are quite\r\nsimilar in size and color to Black Hamburg but the bunches have fewer\r\nberries than the European parent and the quality, as would be expected,\r\nis not so good, falling short chiefly in flesh characters. While Wilder\r\nis surpassed in quality, and, as usually grown, in appearance by other\r\nof Rogers' hybrids, it is one of the most reliable of all of them for\r\nvineyard culture, the vines being vigorous, hardy, fairly productive,\r\nand, though somewhat susceptible to mildew, as healthy as any of the\r\nhybrids of Labrusca and Vinifera. Wilder is not as well known in the\r\nmarkets as it should be, and now that fungal diseases can be controlled\r\nby spraying, this, with other such hybrids, should be more generally\r\nplanted in commercial vineyards and especially for local and special\r\nmarkets. The wine from this, and for that matter from any of Rogers'\r\ngrapes, is not of quality such as recommends it and neither are the\r\ngrapes suitable for grape juice. Surplus fruit would often, therefore,\r\nbe a loss in large plantations.\r\n\r\nWilder is one of the forty-five Labrusca-Vinifera hybrids raised by E.\r\nS. Rogers of Salem, Massachusetts. For an account of its origin and\r\nparentage, see Rogers' Hybrids. The first notes as to the qualities of\r\nthis variety were published in 1858. The variety was placed on the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society list of recommended sorts in 1867 and has\r\nnever been removed. In 1869, Rogers expressing a desire to name one of\r\nhis seedlings after Marshall P. Wilder, Mr. Wilder selected this one as\r\nin his estimation the best of all Rogers' hybrids and it was given his\r\nname.\r\n\r\n     Vine medium to very vigorous, hardy, productive, somewhat\r\n     susceptible to attacks of mildew.

But this is not all that can be said;\r\nthe vines are vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive, and the fruit keeps\r\nand ships well, altogether making a most admirable early grape.\r\nUnfortunately the berries, and under some conditions the bunches, are\r\nsmall, and this, combined with the fact that green grapes are not as\r\npopular as black and red ones, has kept Winchell from being as largely\r\nplanted as it otherwise would have been. Then, too, as has been noted\r\nbefore, the competition from the South, in which larger, cheaper and as\r\ngood grapes compete with early northern crops of this fruit, is limiting\r\nthe production of early varieties of grapes in the North.\r\n\r\nThere are some minor faults, too, which under some conditions become\r\ndrawbacks to the culture of Winchell. At best the bunch of this variety\r\nis loose and characterized by a large shoulder. Sometimes this looseness\r\nbecomes so pronounced as to give a straggling, poorly-formed cluster;\r\nso, too, the shoulder when as large as the cluster itself, which often\r\nhappens, makes the cluster unsightly. There is a tendency, under some\r\nconditions, for the grapes to shell when fully ripe and this is often a\r\nserious fault. Again, while the crop usually ripens evenly yet there are\r\nseasons when two pickings are needed because of unevenness in ripening.\r\nLastly the skin is thin and there is danger in unfavorable seasons, or\r\nin shipping, of the berries cracking though this is seldom a serious\r\nfault. These defects do not begin to offset the several good characters\r\nof Winchell and it is, for New York at least, the standard early green\r\ngrape and deserving to rank with the best early grapes of any color.\r\n\r\nThe original vine of this variety was raised by James Milton Clough of\r\nStamford, Bennington County, Vermont, about the middle of the last\r\ncentury from seed of an unknown purple grape. For some years it had a\r\nlocal reputation and was propagated by some of Clough's neighbors. By\r\nwhat name it was then known does not appear. In December, 1885,\r\naccording to their statements, Ellwanger & Barry of Rochester, New York,\r\nreceived this variety from C. E. Winchell, then of Stamford. In 1888,\r\nthis firm introduced the variety to the trade. The same year there was\r\nintroduced by Stephen Hoyt's Sons of New Canaan, Connecticut, a variety\r\nunder the name Green Mountain. This firm states that they bought the\r\nvariety from James M. Paul, of North Adams, Massachusetts, in December,\r\n1885. Previous to his sale Paul had sent a vine of the grape to this\r\nStation; he exhibited fruit of Green Mountain before the American\r\nPomological Society in 1887, but without any name.\r\n\r\nLater grape-growers found that Winchell and Green Mountain were very\r\nsimilar or identical. Unfortunately, in the meantime, Paul had died and\r\nno one knows positively where he secured his vines although there is\r\nevery reason to believe they were from Mr. Clough. Those who consider\r\nthe Winchell and Green Mountain separate varieties say the Winchell has\r\nlarger berries and is somewhat later in ripening than the Green\r\nMountain. Though unable to make a close comparison of vines and fruits\r\nof the two supposed varieties, the authors of _The Grapes of New York_\r\nchoose to consider them so nearly identical, if not identical, as to\r\npass under one name which should be the one first published, Winchell.\r\n\r\nAlthough the botanical characters of this variety are chiefly Labrusca,\r\nthe thin bloom which sometimes shows on the canes, the occasional\r\nintermittent tendrils, and the lobing of the leaf, indicate slight\r\nadmixtures of Vinifera and Aestivalis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINCHELL]\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, very productive. Canes long to\r\n     medium, numerous, slender, medium dark brown, surface covered with\r\n     very thin bloom; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes above medium\r\n     to short; diaphragm thick; pith medium to below in size; shoots\r\n     pubescent; tendrils continuous, sometimes intermittent, of average\r\n     length, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds medium to below in size, short to medium, thick, open\r\n     early.

While very attractive in appearance its taste belies its looks,\r\nfor the flesh is coarse and the flavor foxy. In spite of its attractive\r\nappearance, Woodruff would scarcely be worth attention were it not for\r\nits excellent vine characters. The vines are hardy, vigorous, productive\r\nand fairly healthy. In appearance it is a typical strong-growing\r\nLabrusca with the varied adaptabilities of that species for soils and\r\nability to withstand adverse conditions. It ripens a little before or\r\nwith Concord and comes on the market at a good time, especially for a\r\nred grape. When introduced Woodruff promised to be a valuable commercial\r\ngrape but its poor quality, the fact that it does not keep well, and a\r\npronounced tendency to crack and shatter, have kept the variety from\r\nbecoming prominent for either vineyard or garden. While it is worthy of\r\nattention under some conditions because of hardiness and possibly other\r\nvine characters, yet it is hardly worth growing where other varieties of\r\nits color and season can be had.\r\n\r\nWoodruff, or as it was first known, Woodruff Red, came from C. H.\r\nWoodruff of Ann Arbor, Michigan. He reported it as a chance seedling\r\nwhich came up in 1874 and fruited for the first time in 1877. It was\r\nsupposed to be a cross of Catawba and Concord. It was introduced in 1885\r\nand placed on the grape list of the American Pomological Society fruit\r\ncatalog in 1889.\r\n\r\n     Vine very vigorous, hardy, produces as heavy or heavier crops than\r\n     Concord, inclined to mildew in unfavorable locations. Canes\r\n     intermediate in length, number and thickness, dark brown; nodes\r\n     slightly enlarged, flattened; internodes medium to short; diaphragm\r\n     medium to above in thickness; pith below average size; shoots\r\n     pubescent; tendrils continuous, of mean length, bifid to trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds small, short to medium, slender, pointed to conical.\r\n     Leaves intermediate in size, of average thickness, somewhat\r\n     roundish; upper surface light green, dull, rugose; lower surface\r\n     greenish-white to bronze, pubescent; veins indistinct; leaf usually\r\n     not lobed with terminus acute to obtuse; petiolar sinus\r\n     intermediate in depth, medium to wide; basal sinus lacking; lateral\r\n     sinus shallow and narrow when present; teeth very shallow and\r\n     narrow. Flowers semi-fertile, open moderately early; stamens\r\n     upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit variable in season of ripening, usually shortly before\r\n     Concord but sometimes slightly later, does not always keep well.\r\n     Clusters variable in size, of fair length, broad, often widely\r\n     tapering, usually single-shouldered or with largest clusters\r\n     sometimes double-shouldered, compact; peduncle medium to long,\r\n     variable in thickness; pedicel medium to short, thick, smooth, with\r\n     scarcely any enlargement at point of attachment to fruit; brush\r\n     long, pale green. Berries large to below medium, roundish to oval,\r\n     dark red, dull, covered with thin lilac to faint blue bloom,\r\n     sometimes drop badly from pedicel, firm. Skin thin, medium to\r\n     tender, adheres strongly to the pulp, contains no pigment, slightly\r\n     astringent. Flesh very pale green to nearly white, translucent,\r\n     juicy, tough, coarse, very foxy, sweet at skin but quite tart at\r\n     center, fair in quality. Seeds do not separate easily from the\r\n     pulp, one to five, average, three or four, intermediate in size,\r\n     medium to broad, short, rather plump, blunt, brownish; raphe\r\n     obscure; chalaza small, slightly above center, oval, not distinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOODRUFF]\r\n\r\n\r\nWORDEN.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _Am.

Of all the offspring of Concord, this variety is best\r\nknown and is most meritorious. It is of the type into which nearly all\r\nof the black seedlings of Concord fall and surpasses all of these in\r\nquality though it does not equal the best of the green seedlings of the\r\nparent in fruit characters, especially in flavor. It differs chiefly\r\nfrom Concord in having larger berries and bunches, in having better\r\nquality and in being from a week to ten days earlier. It is equally\r\nhardy, healthy, vigorous and productive. It is more fastidious in its\r\nadaptations to soil and other conditions than its parents but now and\r\nthen it is found to do even better under some conditions.\r\n\r\nWorden is not as good a grape in many minor characters as the Concord\r\nand this is the chief reason why it is not grown as much as its\r\ndistinguished parent. Its chief fault is that the fruit cracks badly,\r\noften preventing the profitable marketing of a crop. The Concord cracks\r\nalso in unfavorable weather but the cracked berries often, or nearly\r\nalways, partly or wholly recover from the injury through the growing\r\nover of the wounds. The Worden lacks the power of overcoming the\r\ncracking. Beside this tenderness of skin, the pulp of Worden is softer\r\nthan that of Concord, there is more juice and the keeping qualities are\r\nnot as good, so that the variety hardly ships as well as the more\r\ncommonly grown grape. In some seasons there is a decided tendency to\r\nshell or shatter if the fruit is overripe. Worden is very popular in New\r\nYork and the North both for commercial plantations and the garden. It is\r\na more desirable inhabitant of the garden and for nearby markets,\r\nbecause of higher quality, than Concord, and under conditions well\r\nsuited to it, is better as a commercial variety, as it is handsomer as\r\nwell as of better quality. In the markets it ought to sell for a higher\r\nprice than Concord if desired for immediate consumption and if it can be\r\npromptly harvested, as it does not hang well on the vines. In many\r\nmarkets Worden is sold as Concord and has the effect of extending the\r\nConcord season. Its earlier season is against it for a commercial\r\nvariety in the great Chautauqua Grape Belt of New York and with the\r\ndefects mentioned will prevent its taking the place of Concord to a\r\ngreat degree.\r\n\r\nThe Worden was originated by Schuyler Worden of Minetto, Oswego County,\r\nNew York, from seed of Concord planted about 1863. It bore its first\r\nfruit when four years old. Its history is peculiar in that it was for\r\nmany years unappreciated, being confused with Concord, which was\r\nfrequently sent out as Worden. It was placed on the grape list of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1881, where it still\r\nremains. The variety was given its name by J. A. Place of Oswego, New\r\nYork, a local horticulturist of some note and a friend of Worden.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive, yielding as heavy crops\r\n     as Concord. Canes above medium in size and number, thick, dark\r\n     brown with reddish tinge; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes\r\n     intermediate in length; diaphragm thick; pith of fair size; shoots\r\n     pubescent; tendrils continuous, somewhat slender, bifid, sometimes\r\n     trifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds small, short, slender, pointed, open in mid-season. Young\r\n     leaves tinged on under side and along extreme margin of upper side\r\n     with light rose-carmine. Leaves healthy, large, thick; upper\r\n     surface dark green, glossy, smooth; lower surface light bronze,\r\n     pubescent; leaf usually not lobed; petiolar sinus of average depth,\r\n     medium to wide, often urn-shaped; teeth shallow, medium in width.\r\n     Flowers fertile, open in mid-season or earlier; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n     Fruit ripens one or two weeks earlier than Concord, does not keep\r\n     long. Clusters large, medium to long, broad, tapering to\r\n     cylindrical, usually single-shouldered, somewhat compact; peduncle\r\n     short, thick; pedicel of medium length, slender, covered with few\r\n     small warts; brush long, light green. Berries large, roundish to\r\n     oval, dark purplish-black to black, glossy, covered with heavy blue\r\n     bloom, not always persistent, moderately firm. Skin of average\r\n     thickness, somewhat tender, cracks badly, adheres slightly to the\r\n     pulp, contains considerable dark red pigment, astringent. Flesh\r\n     greenish, translucent, juicy, fine-grained, tough, slightly foxy,\r\n     sweet at skin to tart at center, mild, good to very good in\r\n     quality. Seeds adherent, one to five, average three, large, broad,\r\n     medium to short, blunt, brownish; raphe buried in a shallow groove;\r\n     chalaza of average size, slightly above center, oval, somewhat\r\n     obscure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WORDEN]\r\n\r\n\r\nWYOMING.\r\n\r\n(Labrusca.)\r\n\r\n     =1.= _N.

WYOMING RED (1, 2,\r\n     4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15). _Wyoming Red_ (5).\r\n\r\nSuch value as Wyoming has lies in its hardiness, productiveness,\r\nhealthiness and earliness. The general appearance of the fruit of the\r\nvariety is very good; the bunches are well-formed and composed of rich\r\namber-colored berries of medium size. But the quality is poor, being\r\nthat of the wild Labrusca in foxiness of flavor and in the flesh\r\ncharacters. It is not nearly as valuable as some other of the red\r\nLabruscas hitherto described and can hardly be recommended for either\r\nthe garden or the vineyard. It may be of value in breeding work and\r\npossibly for localities in which grapes are precariously hardy or in\r\nwhich more fastidious varieties cannot be grown. Wyoming is illustrated\r\nin _The Grapes of New York_ chiefly because it is a typical red Labrusca\r\nthough in times past it has been of commercial importance and hence has\r\nsome historical interest.\r\n\r\nWyoming was introduced to public notice by Dr. S. J. Parker of Ithaca,\r\nNew York, who states that it came from northern Pennsylvania in 1861.\r\nAbout 1870 it was fruited in central New York where it immediately\r\nattracted attention and was exhibited at various fairs and horticultural\r\nsociety meetings. It was named after the Wyoming Valley, beyond which\r\nplace it could not be traced, and where it presumably originated. The\r\nvariety was first known as Wyoming Red but later the Red was dropped.\r\nAnother variety under the name Wyoming preceded this. It was a\r\nblack-fruited sort of apparently no value and seems now to be obsolete.\r\nThe name Wilmington Red has been used to designate this variety, by what\r\nauthority does not appear, as it was apparently first described under\r\nthe name Wyoming Red. The Wyoming was placed on the grape list of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society fruit catalog in 1889 and removed in 1899.\r\nIn spite of the fact that this variety has been discarded by the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society, it is still offered for sale by many grape\r\nnurserymen.\r\n\r\n     Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive to very productive. Canes\r\n     medium to below in length, numerous, slender, dark reddish-brown,\r\n     surface covered with a slight amount of blue bloom; nodes enlarged,\r\n     frequently flattened; internodes short to medium; diaphragm medium\r\n     to below in thickness; pith medium in size; shoots thinly\r\n     pubescent; tendrils continuous, rather short, bifid.\r\n\r\n     Leaf-buds small, short, slender, pointed to conical, open late.\r\n     Young leaves slightly tinged on under side only with faint\r\n     rose-carmine. Leaves medium in size, of average thickness; upper\r\n     surface light green, dull, smooth; lower surface dull green with\r\n     tinge of bronze, slightly pubescent; lobes none to three with\r\n     terminus acute to acuminate; petiolar sinus medium to shallow, wide\r\n     to medium; basal sinus usually none; lateral sinus shallow and wide\r\n     when present; teeth shallow, of average width. Flowers sterile,\r\n     open in mid-season; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n     Fruit usually ripens from a week to ten days earlier than Concord,\r\n     keeps and ships well for a grape of its species. Clusters medium to\r\n     small, frequently below average length, medium to rather slender,\r\n     slightly cylindrical to tapering, usually not shouldered but\r\n     sometimes with a small single shoulder, compact to medium. Peduncle\r\n     short to medium, slender; pedicel short, slender, covered with few\r\n     small warts; brush slender, medium in length, pale green with\r\n     brownish tinge. Berries above medium to small, roundish, dark dull\r\n     red to rich amber red, covered with thin lilac bloom, persistent,\r\n     firm. Skin medium in thickness, tender, adheres slightly to the\r\n     pulp, contains no pigment, astringent. Flesh pale green,\r\n     translucent, juicy, tough and solid, strongly foxy, vinous, sweet\r\n     at skin to tart at center, poor in quality. Seeds do not separate\r\n     easily from the pulp, one to three, average two and three,\r\n     intermediate in size, breadth and length, slightly notched, usually\r\n     rather blunt, light brown; raphe buried in a narrow, shallow\r\n     groove; chalaza of average size, slightly above center, irregularly\r\n     circular to oval, obscure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WYOMING]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE MINOR VARIETIES OF AMERICAN GRAPES.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Abby Clingotten.= (Lab.)

He stated that the Taylor seedlings failed to germinate\r\nbut that the European Riesling seeds germinated and of the resulting\r\nseedlings Missouri Riesling, Grein Golden and Grein Extra Early were\r\nnamed and introduced. As they are all of the Riparia type, very similar\r\nto Taylor, and show no trace of Vinifera, it has always been supposed\r\nthat Grein had his seeds confused and that it was the European Riesling\r\nthat failed to germinate, Taylor being the real parent of these\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n=Grevaduly.= A Massachusetts seedling of over fifty years ago, mentioned\r\nin the _United States Patent Office Report_ of 1859.\r\n\r\n=Greverson.= A seedling received by the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture over fifty years ago.\r\n\r\n=Grote.= (Rip.)

His\r\nefforts were similar to those of Rogers in that he produced direct\r\nhybrids of Vinifera with early ripening selected Labruscas. He used\r\nseveral varieties of both parent species and produced several thousand\r\nseedlings. Experts to whom samples were sent affirmed that their quality\r\nwas of the best. A few were sent out for testing but the most of them\r\nwere destroyed as Mr. Haskell did not think that any of the offers would\r\nrecompense him for the cost of production. Those sent out were highly\r\ncommended at first but soon dropped from sight. The only named variety\r\nof his is Ruby.\r\n\r\n=Haskew.= Noted in the _American Horticultural Annual_ for 1871 as a\r\nnative grape from W. B. Kelly, Abingdon, Virginia.\r\n\r\n=Hattie.= (Lab.

He corresponded with Frederick Muench,\r\nof Marthasville, who encouraged him in his efforts. Beside selecting\r\nvarious vines from the woods he made crosses of species. His object was\r\nto secure more vigorous, productive and disease-resistant sorts than any\r\nof our standard varieties. He was particularly impressed with the\r\nLincecumii or so-called Summer grapes of his section. His selections of\r\nthis species are notable for their extreme vigor but many of them are\r\nsusceptible to fungi and as they are all self-sterile they are uncertain\r\nbearers when removed from the wild male vines. His most promising\r\nseedlings are as follows:\r\n\r\n_No. 9._ Productive; subject to black-rot; cluster large; berry below\r\nmedium; juicy, sweet; good.\r\n\r\n_No. 12._ Cluster and berry medium; sweet.\r\n\r\n_No. 13._ Hardy, prolific; as large as Ives and of no better quality.\r\n\r\n_No. 17._ Cluster large; berries medium; sweet; good.\r\n\r\n_No. 42._ Cluster very large; berry medium; very sweet and juicy; good.\r\n\r\n_No. 43._ (Linc.)

Does not ripen its wood well\r\nand is slightly tender and very susceptible to leaf-hopper here.\r\nSelf-sterile.\r\n\r\n_No. 50._ See Longworth.\r\n\r\n_No. 56._ See Dufour.\r\n\r\n_No. 70._ See Munson.\r\n\r\n_No. 72._ (Linc. Rup.) A seedling of _No. 43_ crossed with a male vine\r\nof _Vitis rupestris_. Bunch medium, very compact; berry size of Concord,\r\nblack with pale bloom; sweet, of pure flavor; ripens with Norton.\r\n\r\n_No. 100._ (Rip. Lab.) A seedling of Elvira. Vine shows Labrusca\r\ncharacters, very hardy, productive; bunch and berry as large as\r\nConcord, yellowish with reddish tinge; quality and flavor similar to\r\nCatawba; cracks when ripe; season with Delaware.\r\n\r\n=James Seedling.= (Lab.

This is thought to be more just to the writers as the copyright\r\ndate is usually a better indication of the time when the book was\r\nwritten than the date of publication. An effort has been made to present\r\na complete bibliography of grape literature in the United States\r\nincluding many books which, owing to their nature, have been of no use\r\nin the preparation of this work.

Pliny says of this practice: \"In Campania they attach\r\nthe vine to the poplar; embracing the tree to which it is thus wedded,\r\nthe vine grasps the branches with its amorous arms, and as it climbs,\r\nholds on with its knotted trunk till it has reached the very summit; the\r\nheight being sometimes so stupendous that the vintager when hired, is\r\nwont to stipulate for his funeral pile and grave at the owner's\r\nexpense.\"\r\n\r\n[4] Bailey gives the following interpretation of the word \"fox\" and its\r\nderivatives as applied to grapes: \"The term fox-grape was evidently\r\napplied to various kinds of native grapes in the early days, although it\r\nis now restricted to the _Vitis labrusca_ of the Atlantic slope. Several\r\nexplanations have been given of the origin of the name fox-grape, some\r\nsupposing that it came from a belief that foxes eat the grapes, others\r\nthat the odor of the grape suggests that of the fox--an opinion to which\r\nBeverly subscribed nearly two centuries ago--and still others thinking\r\nthat it was suggested by some resemblance of the leaves to a fox's\r\ntrack. William Bartram, writing at the beginning of this century, in the\r\nMedical Repository, is pronounced in his convictions: 'The strong,\r\nrancid smell of its ripe fruit, very like the effluvia arising from the\r\nbody of the fox, gave rise to the specific name of this vine, and not,\r\nas many have imagined, from its being the favourite food of the animal;\r\nfor the fox (at least the American species) seldom eats grapes or other\r\nfruit if he can get animal food.' I am inclined to suggest, however,\r\nthat the name may have originated from the lively foxing or intoxicating\r\nqualities of the poor wine which was made from the wild grapes. At the\r\npresent day we speak of 'foxiness' when we wish to recall the musk-like\r\nflavor of the wild _Vitis labrusca_; but this use of the term is of\r\nlater origin, and was suggested by the name of the grape.\" Bailey, L. H.\r\n_Evolution of Our Native Fruits_: 5. 1898.\r\n\r\n[5] The phylloxera (_Phylloxera vastatrix_ Planch.) has four forms: the\r\nleaf-gall form, the root form, the winged form, and the sexual form.\r\nIndividual leaf insects produce from 500 to 600 eggs, the root insect\r\nabout 100, the winged insect from 3 to 8, and the sexual insect but 1.\r\nThe last is laid in the fall on old wood; the following spring a louse\r\nhatches from it and at once goes to the upper surface of a leaf and\r\ninserts its beak. The irritation thus produced causes a gall to form on\r\nthe lower side of the leaf. In fifteen days the louse becomes a\r\nfull-grown wingless female and proceeds to fill the gall with eggs after\r\nwhich it dies. In about a week females hatch from the eggs and migrate\r\nto form new colonies. Several generations of females occur in a summer.\r\nAt the approach of winter the lice go into the ground where they remain\r\ndormant until spring when they attack the roots forming galls analogous\r\nto those on the leaves and passing through a series of generations\r\nsimilar to those above ground. In the fall of the second year some of\r\nthe root forms give rise to winged females which fly to neighboring\r\nvines. These lay eggs in groups of two or four on the wood of the grape.\r\nThe eggs are of two sizes; from the smaller size, males hatch in nine or\r\nten days; from the larger, females. In the sexual stage no food is taken\r\nand the insects quickly pair. The female produces an egg which fills its\r\nentire body and after three or four days lays it, this being the winter\r\negg, the beginning of the cycle.\r\n\r\nThere are no remedies worthy the name and the only efficient preventive\r\nis to graft susceptible varieties on resistant stocks. Species are\r\nresistant about in the order named: _V. rotundifolia_, _V. riparia_, _V.\r\nrupestris_, _V. cordifolia_, _V. berlandieri_, _V. cinerea_, _V.\r\naestivalis_, _V. candicans_, _V. labrusca_, _V. vinifera_.\r\n\r\n[6] Delaware wrote as follows: \"In every boske and hedge, and not farr\r\nfrom our pallisade gates we have thousands of goodly vines running along\r\nand leaving to every tree, which yealds a plentiful grape in their\r\nkinde. Let me appeale, then, to knowledge if these naturall vines were\r\nplanted, dressed and ordered by skilfull vinearoons, whether we might\r\nnot make a perfect grape and fruitfull vintage in short time?\"\r\nDelaware's Relation. _Brown's Genesis of the United States._ 1611.\r\n\r\n[7] Discourse of the Old Company, _British State Papers_, Vol. III:40\r\nSee _Virginia Magazine of History_, Vol. I:159.\r\n\r\n[8] Laws and Orders of Assembly, Feb. 16, 1623. _McDonald Papers_, Vol.\r\nI:97.

Adding in the conclusion, that they had not heard of the like\r\nin any other country.' Neither was this out of the way, for I have made\r\nthe same experiment, both of their natural vine, and of the plants sent\r\nthither from England.\" _Beverly's Virginia_, Second Edition: 107. 1722.\r\n\r\n[11] Fiske, John. _Old Virginia and Her Neighbors._ Vol. II:372, 385.\r\n\r\n[12] _American Farmer_, Baltimore, 11:35. 1829-30. _Ib._, 12:396.\r\n1830-31.\r\n\r\n[13] Dankers, Jasper, and Sluyter, Peter. _Journal of a Voyage to New\r\nYork in 1679-80_: 130.\r\n\r\n[14] _Documents Relating to the Colonial History of the State of New\r\nYork_, Holland Documents, 1603-1656.

In the first place Nature has given us an index in\r\nthese Plantations that points to us what may be done in that by the help\r\nof art.

The article contains\r\nabout 2000 words, the main part of it being \"A Statement of the Expense\r\nand Income of a Vineyard, Made on Four Acres of Land, situated in\r\nPennsylvania, in the 40th Degree of Latitude.\"\r\n\r\nOf Legaux's life, little is known, other than that he was a French\r\nvine-grower with an experimental vineyard, as he says in the above\r\narticle, at \"Spring Mill, 13 miles N. N. W. from Philadelphia.\" Johnson\r\nspeaks of Legaux as a philanthropist; McMahon calls him a \"gentleman of\r\nWorth and Science\"; while Rafinesque accuses him of fraud and deception\r\nin the matter of calling the native grapes Bland and Alexander,\r\n_Madeira_ and _Cape_.\r\n\r\nJudging the man from his article in _The True American_ and from the\r\nwords of his contemporaries, he was a capable, enthusiastic and\r\nintelligent grape-grower. His philanthropy is more doubtful. It is true\r\nthat he distributed many grape plants but as he himself says to \"fellow\r\ncitizens possessing pecuniary means.\" That he practiced deceit in the\r\nmatter of the introduction of the Alexander as the Cape is probable.\r\nHowever, his deceit, if such it were, may be forgotten and he should be\r\nremembered as the chief disseminator of the Alexander, the first\r\ndistinctive American variety of commercial value.\r\n\r\n[24] _The True American_, March 24, 1800.\r\n\r\n[25] Johnson, S.

Yet, notwithstanding this\r\nmisfortune, the grantees, with increased diligence, are using every\r\nexertion to procure others which are thought to be more congenial to the\r\nsoil and climate, and are now generally engaged in replanting.'\" Quoted\r\nfrom _Studies in Southern and Alabama History_, 1904:131.\r\n\r\n[32] William Robert Prince, fourth proprietor of the Prince Nursery and\r\nLinnæan Botanic Garden, Flushing, Long Island, was born in 1795 and died\r\nin 1869. Prince was without question the most capable horticulturist of\r\nhis time and an economic botanist of note. His love of horticulture and\r\nbotany was a heritage from at least three paternal ancestors, all noted\r\nin these branches of science, and all of whom he apparently surpassed in\r\nmental capacity, intellectual training and energy. He was a prolific\r\nwriter, being the author of three horticultural works which will always\r\ntake high rank among those of Prince's time. These were: _A Treatise on\r\nthe Vine_, _Pomological Manual_, in two volumes, and the _Manual of\r\nRoses_, beside which he was a lifelong contributor to the horticultural\r\npress. All of Prince's writings are characterized by a clear, vigorous\r\nstyle and by accuracy in statement. His works are almost wholly lacking\r\nthe ornate and pretentious furbelows of most of his contemporaries\r\nthough it must be confessed that he fell into the then common fault of\r\nfollowing European writers somewhat slavishly. During the lifetime of\r\nWm. R. Prince, and that of his father Wm. Prince, who died in 1842, the\r\nPrince Nursery at Flushing was the center of the horticultural nursery\r\ninterests of the country; it was the clearing-house for foreign and\r\nAmerican horticultural plants, for new varieties and for information\r\nregarding plants of all kinds.\r\n\r\n[33] Prince, Wm. R. _A Treatise on the Vine_: 337. 1830.\r\n\r\n[34] Nicholas Longworth, known as the \"father of American grape\r\nculture\", was born in 1783, in Newark, New Jersey. At an early age he\r\nwent West making his home in Cincinnati where he became a lawyer,\r\nbanker, and a man of large business affairs in what was then the far\r\nfrontier. From his boyhood Longworth was interested in horticulture and\r\nas a young man became greatly interested in native grapes. He was one of\r\nthe men to whom John Adlum sent the Catawba and he became its\r\ndisseminator and a promoter for the region in which he lived, making\r\nthis grape the first great American grape and Cincinnati the center of\r\nthe foremost grape-growing region of the Continent. He was the first\r\nvineyardist to make wine on a large scale and perfected methods of\r\nmaking wine from the native grapes so that the product was comparable to\r\nthat from the best wine cellars of Europe. Longworth introduced the\r\nfirst cultivated variety of the wild black raspberry, _Rubus\r\noccidentalis_, under the name of the Ohio Everbearing. His interest in\r\nthe strawberry was second only to that in the grape and he not only did\r\nmuch to encourage its cultivation in America but also, after a long\r\ncontroversy with horticulturists and botanists, fully established the\r\nfact that many varieties of this fruit are infertile with themselves and\r\nthat under cultivation infertile varieties must have sorts planted near\r\nthem capable of cross-pollinating them. Longworth took a deep interest\r\nin horticulture generally and gathered about him a group of pioneer\r\nhorticulturists who did much for American fruit-growing in the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century, in many respects molding and guiding the\r\nhorticulture of that time in this country. Longworth wrote much for the\r\ncontemporary horticultural magazines and published two small books,\r\n\"_The Cultivation of the Grape and Manufacture of Wine_\" and \"_Character\r\nand Habits of the Strawberry Plant_.\" He died in 1863, aged 80, at\r\nCincinnati, one of the most distinguished, enterprising and wealthy\r\ncitizens of his State.

Mr. E. Q. Norton of Daphne writes of this vine as\r\nfollows: \"There is little known regarding the Jackson grape vine beyond\r\nthe fact that the oldest man living here when I came here--20 years\r\nago--told me that the Indians told him when he came here as a boy--90\r\nyears ago--that the vine was at that time an old one, which had been\r\ngrowing longer than any of them could remember. It was 27 inches through\r\nthe trunk, four feet above the ground, when I measured it ten years\r\nsince, and the vines were running over the surrounding trees for many\r\nrods. The grapes were very small, quite hard and not very juicy.\"\r\n\r\n[39] The following is an account of the discovery of grapes in Vinland\r\ntranslated from the Icelandic manuscript by Reeves:\r\n\r\n\"When they had completed their house Leif said to his companions, 'I\r\npropose now to divide our company into two groups, and to set about an\r\nexploration of the country; one half of our party shall remain at home\r\nat the house, while the other half shall investigate the land, and they\r\nmust not go beyond a point from which they can return home the same\r\nevening, and are not to separate. Thus they did for a time; Leif\r\nhimself, by turns, joined the exploring party or remained behind at the\r\nhouse. * * *\r\n\r\n\"It was discovered one evening that one of their party was missing, and\r\nthis proved to be Tyrker the German. Leif was sorely troubled by this,\r\nfor Tyrker had lived with Leif and his father for a long time, and had\r\nbeen very devoted to Leif, when the latter was a child. Leif severely\r\nreprimanded his companions, and prepared to go in search of him, taking\r\ntwelve men with him. They had proceeded but a short distance from the\r\nhouse, when they were met by Tyrker, whom they received most cordially.\r\nLeif observed at once that his foster-father was in lively spirits. * *\r\n* Leif addressed him, and asked: 'Wherefore art thou so belated,\r\nfoster-father mine, and astray from the others'. In the beginning Tyrker\r\nspoke for some time in German, rolling his eyes, and grinning, and they\r\ncould not understand him; but after a time he addressed them in the\r\nNorthern tongue: 'I did not go much further [_than you_], and yet I have\r\nsomething of novelty to relate. I have found vines and grapes.' 'Is this\r\nindeed true, foster-father?' said Leif. 'Of a certainty it is true',\r\nquoth he, 'for I was born where there is not lack of either grapes or\r\nvines.' They slept the night through, and on the morrow Leif said to his\r\nshipmates: 'We will now divide our labours, and each day will either\r\ngather grapes or cut vines and fell trees, so as to obtain a cargo of\r\nthese for my ship.' They acted upon this advice, and it is said, that\r\ntheir after-boat was filled with grapes. A cargo sufficient for the ship\r\nwas cut, and when the spring came, they made their ship ready, and\r\nsailed away; and from its products Leif gave the land a name, and called\r\nit Wineland.\" _Finding of Wineland the Good_: 66.

Adlum was one of the first men to see\r\nclearly the possibility of improving the wild grapes of America and of\r\nbringing them under cultivation. He published accounts of this fruit in\r\nhis _Cultivation of the Vine_ and in the agricultural papers of his\r\ntime, thereby aiding in bringing it into public notice as a cultivated\r\nplant. At \"The Vineyard\", near Georgetown, he established an\r\nexperimental plantation of grapes from which he distributed many vines,\r\nchief of which were those of the Catawba, a variety for whose\r\ndissemination he is largely responsible. Adlum tried without avail to\r\nhave the national government found an experimental farm for the culture\r\nof grapes and his effort was one of the first to secure governmental aid\r\nin agricultural experimentation. Beside his work with the grape, Adlum\r\nwas deeply interested in other phases of agriculture and in the\r\nscientific movements of his time. He was a soldier of the Revolution, a\r\nbrigadier-general in the militia of Pennsylvania, a county judge, and a\r\ncivil engineer and surveyor. In spite of his work in the early part of\r\nthe last century for agriculture and for his State and country, Adlum\r\nwas practically unknown to the present generation until a sketch of his\r\nlife and work appeared in Bailey's _The Evolution of Our Native Fruits_\r\nfrom which this sketch is written. Adlum's memory is perpetuated in the\r\nname of the beautiful climbing fumitory of one of the Northern Atlantic\r\nStates, _Adlumnia cirhosa_, bestowed upon him by his contemporary,\r\nRafinesque.

Brown, at Eagleville.\"\r\n\r\nContinuing, he gives an idea of grape production in 1830:--\"The average\r\ncrop of wine with us is 300 gallons per acre. At York, where 2700 vines\r\nare put on one acre, each vine has often produced a quart of wine, and\r\nthus 675 gallons per acre, value $675 in 1823, besides $200 for 5000\r\ncuttings. One acre of vineyard did then let for $200 or 300, thus value\r\nof the acre about $5000: This was in poor soil unfit for wheat, and for\r\nmere Claret.\r\n\r\n\"Now in 1830, that common French Claret often sells only at 50 cents the\r\ngallon, the income must be less. I hope our claret may in time be sold\r\nfor 25 cents the gallon, and the table grapes at one cent the lb. and\r\neven then an acre of vineyard will give an income of $75, and be worth\r\n$1000 the acre.\r\n\r\n\"The greatest check to this cultivation is the time required for grapes\r\nto bear well, from 3 to 6 years: our farmers wishing to have quick\r\nyearly crops; but then when a vineyard is set and in bearing, it will\r\nlast forever, the vines themselves lasting from 60 to 100 years, and are\r\neasily re-placed as they decay.\r\n\r\n\"The next check is the precarious crops if badly managed. Every year is\r\nnot equally plentiful and sometimes there is a total failure when rains\r\ndrown the blossoms; but an extra good crop of 500 or 600 gallons\r\ncommonly follows and covers their loss.\" Rafinesque, C. S. _American\r\nManual of the Grape Vines._, Philadelphia. 1830. pp. 43-45.\r\n\r\n[72] Tradition relates that the first Scuppernong vine known by\r\ncivilized man was found on the coast of North Carolina by Amadas and\r\nBarlowe in 1584 and was transplanted by them to Roanoke Island. An old\r\nvine of great diameter of stem and spread of vine, gnarled in trunk and\r\nbranch, evidently of great age, is known as the \"Mother Scuppernong\" and\r\nis supposed to be the vine transplanted in 1584.\r\n\r\n[73] Calvin Jones writing June 17, 1817, in the _American Farmer_,\r\n=3=:332, from Raleigh, North Carolina, gives the following account of\r\nthe name Scuppernong: \"This grape & wine, had the name of Scuppernong,\r\ngiven to them by Henderson & myself, in compliment to Jas. Blount, of\r\nScuppernong, who first diffused a general knowledge of it in several\r\nwell written communications in our paper--and it is cultivated with more\r\nsuccess on that river, than in any other part of the state, perhaps,\r\nexcept the Island of Roanoke.\" It is worthy of note that Scuppernong is\r\nlargely a sea-board name for _Vitis rotundifolia_ and is not commonly\r\napplied to it outside of the Atlantic States.\r\n\r\n[74] There is some evidence to show that the Clinton contains Labrusca\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n[75] Buchanan, Robert. _Grape Culture_: 61. 1850.\r\n\r\n[76] British Parliamentary Papers (Library of Congress), Vol. 30. 1859.\r\n\r\n[77] _American Pomological Society Report_ for 1852:45.\r\n\r\n[78] _Horticulturist_, 6:445. 1851.\r\n\r\n[79] _Horticulturist_, 6:444. 1851.\r\n\r\n[80] _American Pomological Society Report_ for 1852:45.\r\n\r\n[81] _Magazine of Horticulture_, 11:134. 1845.\r\n\r\n[82] Nuttall says: \"It is probable that hybrids betwixt the European\r\nVine (_Vitis vinifera_) and those of the United States would better\r\nanswer the variable climates of North America, than the unacclimated\r\nvine of Europe. When a portion of the same industry shall have been\r\nbestowed upon the cultivation of the native vines of America, which has\r\nfor so many ages and by so many nations, been devoted to the\r\namelioration of _Vitis vinifera_, we cannot imagine that the citizens of\r\nthe United States will be longer indebted to Europe for the luxury of\r\nwine. It is not however in the wilds of uncultivated nature that we are\r\nto obtain vines worthy of cultivation. Were this the case, Europe would\r\nto the present have known no other Malus than the worthless austere\r\ncrab, in place of the finest apple; no other Pyrus than the acerb and\r\ninedible Pyraster or stone Pear, from which cultivation has obtained all\r\nthe other varieties. It is from seed that new and valuable varieties are\r\ninvariably to be obtained. There is however at the present time, a\r\nvariety of one of the native species cultivated under the name of\r\n'Bland's grape', a hybrid no way in my opinion inferior to some of the\r\nbest European grapes.\"\r\n\r\n[83] \"People who have a good deal of leisure time, ought to make those\r\nexperiments which take many years to know the result. If any where in\r\nthe United States a public Botanic garden should be established, there\r\nwould be the proper place, to have a corner of it appropriated solely\r\nfor the purpose of trying the raising of new species of grapes, either\r\nby seeds or grafts; and if there was a green or hot house, several\r\nspecies of the best grapes, and even a male plant of the most vigorous\r\nindigenous ought to be introduced in it, and trained so that the\r\ncrossing of the breed may be easily done, by bringing two different\r\nsorts of grapes together in time of blossoming, and sow the seeds. I\r\nthink we may anticipate some very good results from such an\r\narrangement.\" _Vine Dresser's Guide_: 228. 1826.\r\n\r\n[84] Of hybridization he says: \"In all attempts at artificial\r\nfecundation, I would recommend that one of the varieties selected be of\r\nnative origin, as there exists no want of hybrids between European\r\nvarieties alone; a large proportion of those now in cultivation having\r\nbeen doubtless produced by natural admixture of the pollen, in the\r\nvineyards where they originated. For the purpose of hybridizing, the\r\nvarieties of _Vitis aestivalis_ should be selected in preference to\r\nthose of _Vitis labrusca_, on account of the much higher vinous\r\nproperties of the former; and there cannot exist a doubt but that we may\r\nreadily produce well acclimated hybrids between the native and foreign\r\nvarieties, without the trouble of continuing the course of reproduction\r\nfor many generations, although such reproduction from species so\r\ndissimilar may continue to present additional modifications of\r\ncharacter.\" _A Treatise on the Vine_: 253-254. 1830.\r\n\r\n[85] U. S. Dept. of Agriculture. Special Report, No. 36. 1880.\r\n\r\n[86] Wine is the fermented juice of the grape. When the juice or must of\r\nthe grape is exposed to temperatures ranging from 55° to 65°F. the\r\nmicro-organisms which accompany the fruit, the yeast of the wine-maker,\r\nare transformed from a comparatively dormant state to one of great\r\nactivity. The action of the organisms on grape must is called\r\nfermentation and through it certain physical and chemical changes take\r\nplace whereby the must is changed in taste and in color, and a part or\r\nall of its sugar is changed into alcohol. The methods of making wine\r\ndiffer in different countries and in different localities depending upon\r\nthe climate, kind of grapes grown, condition of growth, and the kind of\r\nwine produced, yet the principles and chief processes are much the same\r\nand may be briefly described as follows:\r\n\r\nIn general grapes are not picked for wine-making until they have reached\r\nfull maturity thus insuring a higher sugar content, richness of flavor\r\nand perfect color. It is customary to determine the composition of the\r\nmust as to sugar and acid content by various instruments devised for the\r\npurpose and if it lack sugar this ingredient is added; if it be too acid\r\nwater is added; or the composition may be otherwise changed depending\r\nupon a number of circumstances though manifestly reputable wine-makers\r\nchange the natural grape juice as little as possible. Soon after\r\nharvesting the grapes are crushed. The ancient method, which still\r\nprevails in many parts of Europe, was to tramp the grapes with bare feet\r\nor wooden shoes. Tramping is for most part superseded by mechanical\r\ncrushers which break the skins but do not crush the seeds. For some\r\nwines the stems of the grapes are removed; for others it is essential\r\nthat the grapes be not stemmed. Stemming may be done by hand, by a rake\r\nover a screen, or by specially devised machines. If white wine is to be\r\nmade the juice is separated from skins and pulp at once; if red wine is\r\ndesired fermentation takes place in the crushed grapes or marc.\r\n\r\nFermentation is carried on in large tanks or vats varying in capacity\r\nfrom 1000 gallons to 10,000 gallons or more. Some wine-makers prefer\r\nopen vats, others keep them closed. The duration of fermentation depends\r\nupon many conditions and varies from two or three to fifteen or twenty\r\ndays, depending upon the amount of sugar in the must, the temperature,\r\nactivity of ferments, etc., etc. Wine-makers observe several distinct\r\nstages of fermentation which must be closely watched and controlled. A\r\nmost important influence is exerted on fermentation by temperature. The\r\nlimits below which and above which fermentation does not take place are\r\n55° and 90°F. In general it is desirable that fermentation take place at\r\ntemperatures ranging about 70°. When it is found that the sugar is\r\npractically all converted into alcohol, or that such conversion has\r\nproceeded far enough, the new wine is drawn or pumped from the\r\nfermenting vats into casks or barrels where it ages though it may\r\nrequire special treatment for clearing. Before bottling it is usually\r\nnecessary to rack the wine into new barrels twice or three times to stop\r\nsecondary fermentations which invariably take place.\r\n\r\nSpecial treatments result in several distinct classes of wine. Thus we\r\ncan divide wine into _red_ and _white_ as to color. Red wines are\r\nproduced from colored grapes the color being extracted in the process of\r\nfermentation. White wines are made from light colored grapes or if from\r\ncolored fruit the must is not allowed to ferment on the marc and so\r\nextract the color. We may again divide wines into _dry_ and _sweet_. Dry\r\nwines are those in which the sugar is practically all converted into\r\nalcohol. Sweet wines are those which retain more or less sugar. These\r\nare often fortified by the addition of alcohol. A third division is that\r\nof _still_ and _sparkling_ wines. Still wines are those in which the\r\ncarbonic acid gas formed by fermentation has wholly escaped. Sparkling\r\nwines retain a greater or less amount of this carbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\nAll of the above classes are further divided into well marked types\r\naccording to their color and taste, their alcoholic content, and the\r\ncountries in which they are produced. The following are the leading\r\nwines made from native grapes: _Catawba_, _Delaware_, _Concord_,\r\n_Norton's Virginia_, _Ives_, _Scuppernong_, _Iona_, _Claret_, _Port_ and\r\n_Champagne_. Of these _Claret_, _Norton's Virginia_ and _Ives_ are red\r\ndry wines. _Catawba_, _Delaware_, _Iona_ and _Scuppernong_ may be either\r\ndry or sweet white wines. _Port_ is a red sweet wine.\r\n\r\n[87] Vol. 22: No. 3:22.\r\n\r\n[88] Champagne obtains its name from the fact that it is chiefly\r\nproduced in the Province of Champagne in France. Its special\r\ncharacteristic is that during fermentation, which is usually brought\r\nabout in the bottle, the carbonic acid gas generated is absorbed by the\r\nwine. When the bottle is opened the gas is disengaged and the wine\r\neffervesces or \"sparkles\". Good champagne requires grapes of high\r\nquality and of special adaptability; the fruit must be well ripened,\r\nfree from decayed berries, and clean. The first fermentation takes place\r\nduring a period of several months in the regular receptacles for this\r\npurpose after which the wine from several varieties of grapes is\r\nblended. Good champagne usually contains some old wine. After bottling,\r\nthe wine is held at slightly different temperatures for varying lengths\r\nof time to secure proper fermentation in the bottle until at the end of\r\nseveral months it is held at a comparatively low temperature in which\r\nthe bottles remain from three to four years. The bottles must then\r\nreceive some treatment which will remove the sediment which has been\r\nformed by fermentation. This is usually done by placing them in racks\r\ncork down at about an angle of 45 degrees or a little more. By\r\ndexterously shaking and jarring the bottles the sediment is loosened and\r\ndeposited in the neck of the bottle. Lastly the sediment is disgorged by\r\nskillfully withdrawing the cork, a small portion of the wine being\r\nwasted in the operation. The bottles are then filled with a dosage of\r\nrock-candy dissolved in an old dry wine, the amount used determining the\r\nsweetness of the champagne. The bottles are then corked, wired, capped,\r\nlabelled and cased, after which the champagne is ready for the market.\r\n\r\n[89] _Champagne: Decrease in Imports and Increase in Domestic\r\nProduction_, April 25, 1907, p. 427.\r\n\r\n[90] Grape juice is made from clean, sound but not over-ripe grapes. The\r\njuice is pressed out by machinery in commercial practice but in the home\r\nmanufacture of the product, the grapes may be pressed by the hands. If a\r\nlight-colored juice is desired the liquid is extracted without heating\r\nthe grapes; for a red juice the pulp is heated before pressing and the\r\ngrapes must be dark in color. In either case the heating is done in a\r\ndouble boiler so that the juice does not come in direct contact with the\r\nfire. The proper temperature ranges from 180° F. to 200° F. and must\r\nnever exceed the 200° mark if the flavor of uncooked grapes is desired.\r\nAfter heating, the juice is allowed to settle for twenty-four hours in a\r\nglass, crockery or enameled vessel after which it is carefully drained\r\nfrom the sediment and strained through some sterilized filter. In home\r\npractice several thicknesses of flannel, previously boiled, will do for\r\na filter. The liquid is then filled into clean bottles leaving room for\r\nexpansion in the second heating. The bottled juice is now heated a\r\nsecond time after which it is immediately corked and sealed. The\r\nprinciples involved in making grape juice are the same as those observed\r\nin canning fruit and the operation may be varied in the former as it is\r\nin the latter if only certain fundamental processes are followed.\r\n\r\n[91] A raisin is a dried and cured grape. Raisin-making is a simple\r\nprocess. The grapes are arranged on shallow trays, and placed in the sun\r\nto dry, being turned now and then by placing an empty tray on a full one\r\nand turning both over after which the top tray is removed. When the\r\ngrapes are properly dried they are put in bins to sweat preparatory to\r\npacking and shipping. The finishing touch in the drying is sometimes\r\ngiven in curing-houses, however, to avoid injury from rain or dust.\r\nSeeding, grading, packing and selling are now separate industries from\r\ngrowing and curing. At present all raisins are made from varieties of\r\nthe Old World grape, no American sort having been found suitable for\r\nraisin-making. A variety adapted for making a raisin, something better\r\nthan simply a \"dried grape\", must have a large percentage of sugar and\r\nsolids, a thin skin, and a high flavor. American grapes lack in sugar\r\ncontent and have a skin so thick and tough that the fruit does not cure\r\nproperly for a good raisin. The raisin industry in the United States is\r\ncarried on only in California, the great bulk of the crop coming from\r\nthe San Joaquin Valley and a few of the southern counties of that State.\r\nFormerly the raisins used in this country were wholly imported; now this\r\nproduct of the grape is exported and in increasing quantities. The\r\nannual production of raisins is in the neighborhood of 100,000,000\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n[92] According to Bartram, the aborigines of eastern America made\r\nraisins from the wild grapes. He describes the process they used as\r\nfollows: \"The Indians gather great quantities of wild grapes which they\r\nprepare for keeping, by first sweating them on hurdles over a gentle\r\nfire, and afterwards dry them on their bunches in the sun and air, and\r\nstore them up for provisions.\"\r\n\r\n[93] Tarr, R.

The\r\nearly history of not only the viticulture but of the horticulture of the\r\nChautauqua region is interwritten with that of the Fay family. Elijah\r\nFay's children and grandchildren inherited a love of horticulture from\r\ntheir ancestor and several of them, as mentioned in the text, have been\r\nnoted for their horticultural work in this region. Lincoln Fay, a nephew\r\nof Elijah Fay, one of the first men to grow and sell grape vines in the\r\nregion, originated the Fay currant which was afterwards introduced by\r\nhim and his son Elijah H. Fay. Of the Fay family, noted in the annals of\r\ngrape-growing in this region, only G. E. Ryckman and L. R. Ryckman,\r\ngrandchild and great-grandchild of Elijah Fay, are now living. Elijah\r\nFay lived to the ripe age of eighty, dying in 1860. His memory should be\r\nlong cherished as one of the founders of the viticulture of New York.\r\n\r\n[98] The writer is indebted to Mr. G. E.

The beetle lays its eggs in the\r\ncracks and crevices of the bark of the grape vines well above ground.\r\nThe eggs are produced in large numbers, often as many as several hundred\r\nto the vine. Upon hatching, the larvae quickly worm their way into the\r\nground and begin to feed upon the fibrous roots of the vine, passing\r\nfrom these to the larger roots. Possibly the chief damage is done on the\r\nlarger roots which are often entirely stripped of bark for a length of\r\nseveral feet. The larvae attain their full size, a half inch in length,\r\nby the middle of August, and then hibernate until the following June.\r\nThe winter is spent in earthen cells. After about two weeks as pupae in\r\nJune, the full grown beetles emerge from the ground and begin to feed\r\nupon the upper surface of the leaves, eating out the cellular tissue,\r\nthus skeletonizing the foliage. The adults disappear the succeeding\r\nAugust. The most efficient means of checking the fidia so far found is\r\nan application of an arsenical spray applied during the time the beetles\r\nare feeding on the foliage.\r\n\r\n[102] Grape-vine flea-beetle (_Haltica chalybea_ Ill.).--The adult\r\ninsects are shining steel-blue flea-beetles measuring about one-fifth of\r\nan inch in length. They live during the winter under the bark of the old\r\nvines or in rubbish in the fields. They emerge from their winter\r\nquarters during the first warm days of spring, and feed upon the opening\r\nbuds and young leaves. Egg-laying begins late in April or early in May.\r\nThe eggs are placed singly near the buds or upon the leaves and hatch in\r\nabout ten days. The young larvae are dark brown in color but soon become\r\nprominently marked with black dots and patches. They are full grown in\r\nfrom three to four weeks at which time they measure about a quarter of\r\nan inch in length. They feed on the leaves devouring only the soft parts\r\nat first, but finally eating irregular holes through the leaves. When\r\nready to pupate they go a short distance into the ground. The adults\r\nemerge during the latter part of June or early in July. They probably\r\nfeed during all of the summer, finally seeking shelter for the winter as\r\nabove indicated.\r\n\r\nThe vines should be sprayed with paris green, one pound to fifty gallons\r\nof water, just before the buds begin to swell or with some other\r\narsenite. Much pains should be taken to make this application thorough.\r\nLater when the worms appear on the leaves, paris green may be applied at\r\nthe usual strength, one pound to 150 gallons of lime and water, or\r\ncombined with bordeaux mixture. Both upper and under surfaces of the\r\nleaves should be covered. Applications of arsenicals for the grape-vine\r\nfidia will help greatly to keep this insect in check.\r\n\r\n[103] Grape leaf-hopper (_Typhlocyba comes_ Say).--There are several\r\nspecies of leaf-hoppers which attack the grape but this species is\r\nprobably the most common in this State. These little leaf-hoppers are\r\noften erroneously called thrips. The adult insects measure about\r\none-eighth of an inch in length. They vary greatly in color but the\r\nprevailing color is usually light yellowish-green. The back and wings\r\nare ornamented with bright red, yellow and brown. They are found upon\r\nthe vines from spring until fall. They feed together, sucking the sap\r\nfrom the leaves, principally from the under surface, causing them to\r\nturn brown in patches. The eggs are deposited singly in the tissue of\r\nthe under surface of the leaves. The young resemble the adults in form\r\nbut are not provided with wings and are green or yellowish-green in\r\ncolor. There are several broods during the season. Some of the adults of\r\nthe last brood hibernate in any convenient rubbish about the vineyard.\r\nTreatment for young hoppers should be made early in July. To obtain the\r\nbest results use whale-oil soap at the rate of one pound to ten gallons\r\nof water, directing the spraying with the hand. Vineyards and adjacent\r\nland should be kept as free as possible from grass and weeds as they\r\nafford shelter to the insect.\r\n\r\n[104] Grape berry moth (_Polychrosis viteana_ Clem.).--The young\r\ncaterpillars feed within the grapes finally causing them to turn dark\r\ncolored and to wither. This injury is sometimes mistaken for the\r\nblack-rot. After devouring the soft parts of one grape the caterpillar\r\ngoes to another, fastening the two together by a silken thread. This may\r\nbe continued until several in a bunch have been destroyed by one\r\ncaterpillar. The young caterpillars are very light green in color with a\r\nbrown head. When full grown they measure about one-fourth of an inch in\r\nlength and are dark olive green in color tinged slightly with red. The\r\ncocoon is formed on a leaf and is partially composed of two small pieces\r\ncut out of the leaf. The adults of the spring brood emerge in from\r\ntwelve to fourteen days. The fore-wings have a bluish tinge and are\r\nmarked with brown, while the posterior wings are dull brown. The moths\r\nare small measuring nearly half an inch from tip to tip when the wings\r\nare spread. The eggs are probably laid late in June or early in July.\r\nThere are two broods annually in this State. As the caterpillars spend\r\nmost of their lives within the grape berries, spraying does not entirely\r\ncontrol the pest. Yet the arsenicals applied for the grape-vine fidia\r\nwill help much in keeping it in check. Picking and destroying the\r\ninfested fruit and the leaves containing the cocoons helps much.\r\n\r\n[105] For a full account of the geology of these lakes and the valleys\r\nin which they lie, see the _Physical Geography of New York State_ by\r\nRalph S. Tarr. New York. 1902.\r\n\r\n[106] Black-rot (_Guignardia bidwellii_ (Ell.) V. & R.) usually appears\r\nfirst on the leaves where it forms circular, reddish-brown spots on\r\nwhich black pimples, or spore cases, develop. Within these spore cases,\r\nat maturity, are the summer spores. These are distributed by the\r\nelements to the growing parts of the plant and form new centers of\r\ninfection. The diseased berries show analogous circular spots bearing\r\nspores and as the disease progresses the grapes wither, turn black, and\r\nbecome hard and shrivelled, sometimes clinging to the vine until the\r\nfollowing spring. Growing shoots are attacked as well as leaves and\r\nfruit. During the winter and spring the resting spores are formed,\r\nusually upon the shrivelled berries.\r\n\r\nTreatment consists of destroying as far as possible all diseased fruit,\r\nold leaves and prunings and in spraying thoroughly with bordeaux mixture\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n1. Just as the pink tips of the first leaves appear.\r\n\r\n2. From ten days to two weeks after the first spraying.\r\n\r\n3. Just after the blossoming.\r\n\r\n4. From ten to fourteen days after the third spraying.\r\n\r\n5. After an interval of from ten to fourteen days from the fourth\r\nspraying.\r\n\r\n[107] Downy mildew (_Plasmopara viticola_ (B. & C.) Berl. & De Toni) is\r\na troublesome fungus attacking all of the tender growing parts of the\r\ngrape. It does most damage to the leaves, upon the upper surface of\r\nwhich it produces greenish-yellow spots of irregular outline. At the\r\nsame time a loose white downy growth appears on the under side of the\r\nleaves. This growth consists of short filaments bearing spores, the\r\nsummer spores, which are carried by the elements to other growing parts\r\nof the plant, thus spreading the disease. Affected berries, if young,\r\nfirst show a brown spot, and become covered with the gray down which\r\ndistinguishes the fungus. On older berries the fungus causes a\r\nbrown-purple spot which spreads until it takes in the whole berry, which\r\nthen becomes soft and often falls, or they may become hard and persist.\r\nAt this stage the disease is commonly known as \"brown rot\". The winter,\r\nor resting, spores are produced in the tissue of fruit and leaves and\r\nwith a thick protective covering. The winter spores are dark, almost\r\nblack, in color. Downy mildew spreads and does most damage in hot wet\r\nweather. Spraying with bordeaux mixture as indicated for black-rot will\r\nkeep downy mildew in check.\r\n\r\n[108] Powdery mildew (_Uncinula necator_ (Schw.) Burr.) is caused by a\r\nfungus which lives on the surface of the leaves. It subsists by means of\r\nsucker-like organs which penetrate the walls of the surface layer of\r\ncells. The vegetative portion of the parasite consists of fine white\r\nfilaments which spread over the surface of the leaves, shoots and fruit.\r\nIn the summer these filaments send up short, irregular stalks upon which\r\nlarge numbers of barrel-shaped spores are produced in chain-like\r\narrangement. These are the summer spores of the fungus. They are borne\r\nin greatest quantity on the upper surfaces of the leaves and give the\r\nleaf a gray, powdery appearance--hence the name, powdery mildew.\r\nAffected leaves finally become light brown and often fall. Diseased\r\nfruits are gray in color, scurfy, become specked with brown, fail to\r\ndevelop and often burst on one side thereby showing the seeds. The\r\nwinter or resting spores are borne in sacs, in the latter part of the\r\nseason. The spore sacs, in their turn, are borne in small, black,\r\nspherical spore cases, each furnished with a number of slender\r\nappendages having curled tips. The powdery mildew, unlike most other\r\nfungus troubles of the grape, is most prevalent in hot dry weather. The\r\ndisease is combatted by dusting with flowers of sulphur or by spraying\r\nwith bordeaux mixture as for black-rot.\r\n\r\n[109] Anthracnose (_Sphaceloma ampelinum_ De By.).--This disease attacks\r\nany of the tender portions of the growing vine. When the leaves are\r\naffected dark spots are first formed on their surface. As the disease\r\nadvances these spots enlarge, and irregular cracks are often formed\r\nthrough the dead tissue. Frequently many of these small cracks run\r\ntogether, forming a long irregular slit through the leaf. Similar marks\r\nare formed on the tender shoots, though they are not so noticeable. When\r\nthe fruit is attacked the disease is sometimes called bird's-eye rot.\r\nCircular spots are formed on the surface of the berry. The spots may be\r\nof different colors and usually have a dark border; as the spots enlarge\r\nand eat in, a seed is often exposed in the center. In rotting the tissue\r\nbecomes hard and wrinkled. Sometimes the disease girdles the stem of a\r\nfruit cluster, cutting off the supply of sap from the grapes beyond the\r\ndiseased line and causing them to shrivel and die.\r\n\r\nAnthracnose does not spread as rapidly as some other vineyard diseases,\r\nneither does it yield as readily to treatment. When a vineyard is badly\r\ninfested with anthracnose, it requires prompt attention and a careful\r\ntreatment to control the disease. It is not satisfactorily controlled by\r\nbordeaux mixture alone. It is suggested that in addition to such\r\ntreatment with this mixture as is given for black-rot the plan be\r\nfollowed which is advocated by certain European authorities, of applying\r\na warm saturated solution of copperas (iron sulphate) in spring when the\r\nbuds are swelling but before they begin to open. One per ct. or more of\r\nsulphuric acid may be added to the solution before it is applied. This\r\nsolution must be handled with care as it is very caustic. It is applied\r\nwith swabs or if the acid is not used it may be sprayed. It is essential\r\nthat the work be done thoroughly, covering all the surface of the canes.\r\n\r\n[110] Chlorosis or yellow leaf.--The name is applied to a grape disease\r\nin which the foliage turns yellow, later becoming brown. It is common in\r\nseveral parts of the State but more particularly in the Central Lakes\r\ndistrict. Chlorosis is more likely to appear in wet seasons. Some\r\nvarieties, as the Diamond, are much more susceptible than others. In\r\nsome seasons portions of the leaves may become yellow but eventually\r\nregain their normal color so that at the close of the season the vine\r\nappears to be in a healthy condition. In other instances the yellow\r\ncolor extends over the entire leaf; brown, dead patches appear; the leaf\r\ncurls and eventually drops from the vine. If the vine loses its leaves\r\ntwo or three seasons in succession it is likely to die. One striking\r\npeculiarity of the disease is the fact that a badly diseased vine may\r\nappear by the side of a perfectly healthy vine of the same variety.\r\n\r\nThe cause of chlorosis, as given by foreign investigators, is the\r\npresence of a large amount of lime in the soil which prevents the roots\r\nfrom taking up an amount of iron sufficient for satisfactory growth.\r\nTheir experiments seem to show that the difficulty may be overcome by\r\napplying a small amount of sulphate of iron around affected plants. But\r\nsince there are a number of good American varieties that are not subject\r\nto chlorosis, perhaps the better method to pursue is to plant only such\r\nvarieties as are known to be free from this trouble.\r\n\r\nThe standard varieties given in the following list are, so far as we\r\nknow, practically exempt from chlorosis: Moore Early, Concord, Winchell,\r\nDelaware, Worden, Niagara, Catawba, Vergennes and Agawam.\r\n\r\n[111] Tarr, R. S., _The Physical Geography of New York State_: 4. 1902.\r\n\r\n[112] See _Story of the Vine_, E. R. Emerson: 198. 1902.\r\n\r\n[113] Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, a French botanist of considerable\r\nreputation in his day, was born at Aix, Provence, in 1656 and died in\r\n1708. He was educated by the Jesuits for a priest but following a\r\nnatural inclination he later became a botanist. In 1683 he became\r\nprofessor of botany at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. While occupying\r\nthis position he made trips through western Europe, Greece and Asia\r\nMinor. His principal work, and the one quoted here, is _Institutiones\r\nRei Herbariae_ in three volumes, published in Paris in 1700. He was one\r\nof the most prominent systematic botanists who preceded Linnaeus.\r\n\r\n[114] Humphrey Marshall was born in the town of West Bradford,\r\nPennsylvania, in 1722, of Quaker parents. He was a cousin of John\r\nBartram, their mothers being sisters. Like Bartram, he had few\r\nopportunities for education, not going to school after he was twelve\r\nyears of age. He was a stone-mason by trade, studying botany in his\r\nleisure moments. In 1773 he started a botanic garden at Marshallton. In\r\n1785 he published _Arbustrum Americanum, The American Grove, or An\r\nAlphabetical Catalog of Forest Trees and Shrubs, Natives of the American\r\nUnited States_. This work had been in preparation about five years\r\nprevious to its publication. It is said to be the first botanical work\r\nof a native American. Marshall died in 1801.\r\n\r\n[115] But little is known of the life of Thomas Walter. He was a native\r\nof Hampshire, England, and migrated to St. John's Parish, South\r\nCarolina, where he had a plantation on the Santee River. Here he died in\r\n1788 at about the age of forty-eight years. His only publication of note\r\nis the _Flora Caroliniana_, published in the year of his death. He must\r\nhave been in correspondence with European botanists of that time as his\r\nherbarium is preserved in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[116] Grapes are not to-day considered dioecious but polygamo-dioecious,\r\na distinction which will be defined later.\r\n\r\n[117] John Bartram was born near the village of Darby in Delaware (then\r\nChester) County, Pennsylvania, in 1699. Bartram is generally credited\r\nwith having established the first botanical garden in America. This\r\ngarden was founded about 1728, some four miles south of what was the\r\ntown of Philadelphia and is now a part of the Park System of that city.\r\nHe was bred a Quaker but owing to his liberal opinions was excluded from\r\nthat Society in 1758. During his life he was in correspondence with many\r\nof the leading scientific men of Europe to whom he sent many specimens\r\nof plants and other things of scientific interest. He made many trips\r\ninto various parts of the colonies, to Ontario, Lake George, the\r\nCarolinas, Florida and Georgia, in search of information. The last of\r\nthese journeys, that to the southern states, was made after he was\r\nseventy years of age. Bartram is blamed by all of his contemporaries for\r\nnot having published more than he did. His death occurred in 1777.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bartram, son of John Bartram, was born in 1739 and died in 1823.\r\nMuch of his work was done in connection with his father under whom he\r\nreceived his botanical training. His best known work is his _Travels in\r\nthe Carolinas, Georgia and Florida_ (1791), in which he gives an\r\ninteresting account of that region, including descriptions of a number\r\nof new southern plants. His article on grapes which is here quoted was\r\npublished in the _Domestic Encyclopedia_, 1804, and also in the _Medical\r\nRepository_ of the same year.\r\n\r\n[118] Thomas Nuttall was born in Settle in Yorkshire, England, in 1786.\r\nHe migrated to the United States in 1807, making his home in\r\nPhiladelphia where he became acquainted with William Bartram and Dr.\r\nBarton. It was largely owing to the influence of these men that he\r\nturned his attention to botany. Nuttall was an extensive traveler and\r\nmade botanical expeditions into many parts of the country. He explored\r\nthe Middle West up to the Rocky Mountains and made a trip around the\r\nHorn to California. From 1825 to 1834 he was connected with Harvard\r\nCollege. In 1842 he was called to England by a bequest from an uncle\r\nleft to him conditional on his residing for nine months of each year in\r\nEngland; compliance with this request caused a cessation of his\r\nbotanical work in America. He died at Nutgrove, Lancashire, in 1859.\r\nNuttall's first and probably greatest work was his _Genera of North\r\nAmerican Plants and Catalogue of the Species_, published in 1818.\r\nBesides various accounts of his expeditions he made an addition of three\r\nvolumes to Michaux's _Sylva_ bringing that work up to six volumes.\r\n\r\n[119] Constantine Samuel Rafinesque was born in Galata, a suburb of\r\nConstantinople in European Turkey, in 1783. He was of French-German\r\ndescent, his father being a French merchant of Marseilles, and his\r\nmother of Saxon parentage. In 1802 he came to Philadelphia. While here\r\nhe was busied with mercantile pursuits, occupying a position as clerk,\r\nbut studied botany out of office hours for amusement. In 1805 he went to\r\nSicily where he spent the next ten years. Here he commenced the\r\nextensive series of publications which have made his name so well known\r\nto scientists. In 1815 he returned to the United States, traveling about\r\nfrom place to place for some time and finally settling in Lexington,\r\nKentucky, where he became a professor in Transylvania University. He\r\nleft Lexington in 1825, removing to Philadelphia, where he spent the\r\nremainder of his life, dying in poverty in 1840. Rafinesque's biographer\r\ngives 420 differently titled articles on nearly all scientific subjects\r\nas the product of his pen. His monograph on grapes, entitled _American\r\nManual of the Grape Vine and The Art of Making Wines_, etc., was\r\npublished in Philadelphia in 1830.\r\n\r\n[120] _Mo. Ent.

W.\r\n\r\n[126] André Michaux was a French botanist, born at Satory, Versailles,\r\nin 1746. He took up the study of botany and made many trips to foreign\r\nlands in behalf of the French Government. One of these was an expedition\r\nto North America where he remained from 1785 to 1796 exploring the\r\ncountry and gathering many botanical specimens through Canada, Nova\r\nScotia and the United States as far west as the Mississippi. His chief\r\nworks are _Histoire des chenes de l'Amerique Septentrionale (History of\r\nthe Oaks of North America)_, 1801; and _Flora Boreali Americana_, 1803.\r\nHe described and named _Vitis rotundifolia_, _V. aestivalis_, _V.\r\ncordifolia_, _V. riparia_, and _V. rubra_, as well as giving much\r\ninformation on other species. Michaux died on the Island of Madagascar\r\nin 1802.\r\n\r\nF. André Michaux was born at Versailles in 1770 and died at Vaureal in\r\n1855. He was a son of André Michaux and also a botanist, and like his\r\nfather employed by the French Government to explore North America with a\r\nview of introducing valuable plants into France. He published in\r\n=18=10-13 a _Histoire des Arbres Forestieres de l'Amerique\r\nSeptentrionale_ which was later translated into English under the name\r\n_North American Sylva_. He also published _A Voyage a l-ouest des Monts\r\nAlleghanys_, 1804.\r\n\r\n[127] For discussion of _Vitis vulpina_ see foot-note under _Vitis\r\nriparia_.\r\n\r\n[128] All grapes, other than the Rotundifolia, are in the South known as\r\n\"bunch grapes\" because they are sold on the market in clusters, the\r\nRotundifolia being sold off the stems.\r\n\r\n[129] _S. C. Sta. Bul._ =132. 1907.=\r\n\r\n[130] _Bush. Cat._, =1894=:22.\r\n\r\n[131] Husmann, =1895=:188.\r\n\r\n[132] Husmann, G. C., _California Fruit Grower_, Mar. 14, 1908.\r\n\r\n[133] Samuel Botsford Buckley was born in 1809, in Yates County, New\r\nYork, and was educated at Wesleyan University, where he graduated in\r\n1836. In 1866 he was appointed State Geologist of Texas where he resided\r\nuntil he died in 1884. Buckley traveled extensively in connection with\r\nhis work, explored the southwestern region of the Appalachian Mountains,\r\nas well as the southwestern portion of the United States. He was at\r\ngreat disadvantage in his publications in that they were prepared\r\nwithout the benefit of a library. His articles on grapes were published\r\nin the _Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences_ for\r\n1861, and in the _United States Patent Office Report_ for the same year.\r\n\r\n[134] The description of _Vitis vulpina_ by Linnaeus is so meager,\r\nincluding the leaves only, that for many years botanists were in doubt\r\nas to the species intended. Muhlenberg was the single exception when he\r\ngave Linnaeus' Vulpina and Michaux's Cordifolia as synonymous. Whether\r\nhe did this from knowledge, or whether it was by chance, it is\r\nimpossible to say. He states no reasons and consequently received no\r\nfollowing among other botanists. Elliott supposed that Linnaeus intended\r\nto describe the southern Rotundifolia and this view seems to have been\r\ngenerally accepted.\r\n\r\nIn the late eighties or early nineties, Planchon first, and later\r\nBritton, by referring to Linnaeus' specimens, determined that the\r\nlatter's Vulpina was the same as Riparia, and in accordance with\r\nbotanical rules, presented the name Vulpina as the correct name for this\r\nspecies. Bailey, however, states (_Ev. Nat. Fr._, =1898=:102) that he\r\nfound two specimens in the Linnaeus collection labeled Vulpina, one of\r\nwhich was the true Riparia and the other Cordifolia. Since a change of\r\nthe name would bring confusion to more than ninety years of botanical\r\nand horticultural literature, it seems inadvisable to make one on such\r\ncontradictory evidence.\r\n\r\n[135] Planchon is our authority for calling this Riparia.\r\n\r\n[136] Translation from the Latin.\r\n\r\n[137] Isadore Bush was born at Prague, Bohemia, in 1822. Bush was one of\r\nthose Germans who, taking part in the troubles of the Fatherland in\r\n1848, found it necessary to seek a home in the New World. He went to\r\nMissouri upon his arrival in the country and there spent the remainder\r\nof his life. During the Civil War he was secretary to General Frémont\r\nand at various times occupied many other positions of trust. He\r\nestablished the Bushberg nursery which for many years was the leading\r\ngrape nursery of this country. With the aid of Engelmann and others he\r\nwrote the _Bushberg Catalogue and Grape Manual_, a work which has passed\r\nthrough many editions and has probably been more popular and useful than\r\nany other book on American grapes published in the English language.\r\nBush died in St. Louis in 1898, having been a citizen of that place for\r\nforty-nine years.\r\n\r\n[138] Thomas Volney Munson, the well-known nurseryman, viticulturist,\r\nand plant-breeder, was born near Astoria, Illinois, September 26, 1843.\r\nHe graduated from Kentucky University, Lexington, Kentucky, in 1870. His\r\nnursery has for thirty-one years been located at Denison, Texas. Munson\r\nhas introduced more hybrid grapes than any other man in America and\r\nprobably in the world. He has paid great attention to grape botany,\r\nparticularly to the southwestern species. Monographs on grapes, from his\r\nhand, have appeared in the proceedings of various horticultural\r\nsocieties and in horticultural journals. Bulletins written by him have\r\nbeen issued by the United States Department of Agriculture and the Texas\r\nExperiment Station. He has at present a book ready for publication\r\nentitled _Foundations of American Grape Culture_. The varieties produced\r\nby Munson are particularly successful in the Southwest where conditions\r\nare such that most of our northern varieties fail. The most valuable of\r\nthose that have been thoroughly tested are Brilliant, America, Carman,\r\nGold Coin and Rommel.\r\n\r\n[139] See page 21.\r\n\r\n[140] Jules Emile Planchon, a French systematic and horticultural\r\nbotanist, was born in Ganges (Herault) in 1823, and died at Montpellier\r\nin 1888. Planchon was a writer of many valuable monographs on botanical\r\nsubjects and in combination with F. Sahut and J. Bazille discovered that\r\nthe cause of a mysterious and serious malady which had been affecting\r\nthe French vineyards for some years, was due to an insect on the roots,\r\nthe phylloxera. Later, he and C. V. Riley determined that this insect\r\nwas a native of America. Planchon was one of the first to suggest, and\r\nalways urged, the reconstitution of French vineyards by the use of\r\nAmerican stocks. During the later years of his life he was professor of\r\nbotany in the School at Montpellier. His most noted contribution to\r\ngrape literature is his monograph of the grape vine and other plants of\r\nthe Ampelopsis family which appeared as the second half of the fifth\r\nvolume of the continuation of De Candolle's _Prodromus Systematis\r\nNaturalis_.\r\n\r\n[141] Martin Vahl, a Norwegian, was born in 1749, and died in 1804. As a\r\npupil of the great Linnaeus, Vahl became a prominent worker in botany\r\nand natural history in Denmark and was an author and writer of note on\r\nthese subjects, publishing much on botany. He traveled extensively, but\r\nit does not appear that he visited North America, though he wrote three\r\nlarge volumes on the flora of tropical America. It is probable that he\r\nnamed and described _Vitis palmata_ from herbarium specimens.\r\n\r\n[142] Jean Louis Berlandier was a Belgian pupil of the great De\r\nCandolle, but left Europe about 1828 for America and became a druggist\r\nin Matamoras, Mexico. He was one of the first botanists to explore\r\nnorthern Mexico and Texas. In attempting to cross one of the small\r\nstreams south of the Rio Grande in 1851, he was drowned. Many of his\r\npapers, plants and some paintings are preserved in the herbarium of\r\nHarvard University and his services to botany are commemorated by the\r\ngenus Berlandiera, dedicated to him by De Candolle, and the species\r\n_Vitis berlandieri_ here described.\r\n\r\n[143] George Engelmann was born at Frankfurt-on-the-Main in 1809. He was\r\neducated at the Universities of Heidelberg, Berlin and Wurzburg,\r\nreceiving a doctor's degree in medicine from the latter institution. In\r\n1832 Dr. Engelmann sailed for America and spent some months in exploring\r\nthe forests of the Mississippi Valley studying the plants of the region,\r\nhaving become deeply absorbed in botany. He soon after began the\r\npractice of medicine in St. Louis where he spent the remainder of his\r\nlife, dying in 1884. Engelmann was one of the most patient and devoted\r\nstudents of natural history of his time. He mastered several difficult\r\ngenera of plants, doing his work so well that his monographs will long\r\nremain, not only authorities on the plants described, but models for the\r\nsystematic botanist. Among the genera to which he devoted his time was\r\nVitis, upon which he published several monographs. These appeared in\r\nvarious publications, particularly the _Proceedings of the Academy of\r\nScience of St. Louis_ in 1860, the _American Naturalist_ for 1868,\r\nRiley's reports as entomologist of Missouri for 1872 and 1874, and the\r\nthird and all later editions of the _Bushberg Catalogue_.\r\n\r\n[144] George Bentham was born near Plymouth, England, in 1800. His\r\nfather was a man of considerable wealth and the son was privately\r\neducated. Early in life he showed an inclination toward botany, writing\r\na book on _The Plants of the Pyrenees and Lower Languedoc_ which was\r\npublished when he was only twenty-six years old. For a time he studied\r\nlaw in which he showed considerable talent and where his original views\r\nattracted some attention. Later, however, he gave his attention to\r\nbotany almost exclusively, joined the London Horticultural Society and\r\nthe Linnaean Society, and was more or less closely connected with the\r\nworkers at Kew. In connection with J. D. Hooker he wrote the _Genera\r\nPlantarum_. Others of his well-known works are _Flora Australiensis_ and\r\n_Handbook of the British Flora_. Bentham died in 1884.\r\n\r\n[145] This name has been spelled \"Lincecumii\" and \"Linsecomii.\" Buckley\r\ntells us (_U. S. Pat. Off. Rpt._, =1861=:486) that this grape was named\r\nin honor of \"Dr. Gideon Linsecom\" of Long Point, Washington County,\r\nTexas. Engelmann changed the spelling to Lincecum without giving any\r\nreason for the change. Munson states that a daughter of Dr. Lincecum\r\nsays that her father always spelled his name Lincecum. It is\r\ninconceivable that Buckley did not know how to spell his friend's name.\r\nThere is other corroborative evidence that Buckley was either a poor\r\npenman, or did not read proof, or both. In his Latin description of this\r\nspecies nearly every other word is misspelled, and the mistakes are\r\nthose of a printer rather than of one whose Latin is weak, such as\r\n\"totis\" for \"lobis,\" etc. Munson says that on the different herbarium\r\nspecimens of this species collected by Buckley, the name is spelled both\r\nways but he is not able to tell which are in Buckley's hand. As the\r\noriginal error seems to be one by the printer or amanuensis it does not\r\nseem desirable to perpetuate it. We have consequently adopted the\r\nspelling of Engelmann and Munson.\r\n\r\n[146] Liberty Hyde Bailey was born in 1858 in South Haven, Michigan. He\r\ngraduated from the Michigan Agricultural College in 1882 and then\r\nstudied botany for two years with Asa Gray at Harvard University. He\r\nbecame professor of horticulture at his Alma Mater in 1885 and resigned\r\nin 1888 to accept the Chair of Horticulture in Cornell University, a\r\nposition which he filled until 1904 when he became Director of the\r\nCornell University Agricultural Experiment Station and Dean of the New\r\nYork State College of Agriculture. In 1907 he was given the degree of\r\nDoctor of Laws by the University of Wisconsin. Dr. Bailey is known as a\r\nteacher and experimenter but is better known for his horticultural and\r\nbotanical writings. He has published many popular books on agricultural\r\nsubjects. The best known of these are: _The Nursery Book_; _The Rule\r\nBook_; _Principles of Vegetable Gardening_; _Garden Making_; _The\r\nPruning Book_; _The Survival of the Unlike_; _The Evolution of Our\r\nNative Fruits_. Besides these popular, or semi-popular works he has\r\npublished two cyclopedias: _The Cyclopedia of American Horticulture_ and\r\n_The Cyclopedia of American Agriculture_. Dr. Bailey's position in\r\nAmerican horticultural literature is unique in that he represents the\r\nbotanical side of horticulture. He has written monographs on several of\r\nour cultivated fruits, notably grapes and plums, both appearing in _The\r\nEvolution of Our Native Fruits_.\r\n\r\n[147] _Am. Gard._, =12=:584. 1891.\r\n\r\n[148] John Eaton Le Conte was born near Shrewsbury, New Jersey, in 1784\r\nand died at Philadelphia in 1860. In 1817 he entered the army as a\r\ntopographical engineer, and in 1831 was retired with the grade of major.\r\nLe Conte early became interested in natural history and his military\r\nexpeditions gave him ample opportunity for studying the flora and fauna\r\nof eastern America. He published a number of important botanical papers,\r\none of which was _The Vines of North America_ published in 1854-55. His\r\ncontributions to the genus Vitis will be found under that head.\r\n\r\n[149] Augustin Pyramus De Candolle was born at Geneva, Switzerland,\r\n1778, and died at Turin, Italy, in 1841. He came of an ancient French\r\nfamily which had been driven out of Provence in the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century owing to their religion. He began his scientific\r\nstudies at the College of Geneva, but later removed to Paris where he\r\nattended courses of lectures on natural science under the greatest\r\nscientists of that day. His best known works are: _Historia plantarum\r\nSucculentarum_; _Synopsis plantarum in flora Gallica descriptarum_; and\r\n_Prodromus Systematis regni vegetabilis_ (1824-), this last being only\r\nabout two-thirds completed at the time of his death.\r\n\r\nAlphonse Louis Pierre Pyrame De Candolle was born in Paris, France, in\r\n1806. Like his father, whose life is sketched above, he became a noted\r\nbotanist. His most important works have been translated into English and\r\nare as follows: _Geographical Botany_, 1855; _Origin of Cultivated\r\nPlants_, 1883; and the _Memoirs_ of his father, 1862. He died in Geneva,\r\nSwitzerland, in 1893.\r\n\r\n[150] The name Labrusca is an old one originally applied to a grape\r\ngrowing wild in Italy. Engelmann states that this grape is still known\r\nto the Italians by the name Brusca. It was probably applied to the\r\nAmerican species by Linnaeus under the mistaken supposition that our\r\nnorthern Fox grape was the same as the wild Italian species.\r\n\r\n[151] Carl von Linne, better known in the Latin form of Carolus\r\nLinnaeus, was born in 1707 at Rashult in the province of Smäland,\r\nSweden. His father, a minister, endeavored to educate his son to follow\r\nthe same profession. In this he failed, as Linnaeus from his earliest\r\nyears took no interest in the classical studies then taught. His father\r\nwas finally induced to educate young Linnaeus as a physician. Linnaeus\r\nwas the greatest systematist in the history of botany. His general\r\nsystem, though much modified, is still in use. Although he named many\r\nspecies of plants, it was not as a traveler and explorer but as a\r\nrecipient of the results of travels of others that the specimens were\r\nsecured from which the descriptions were made. Linnaeus died at Upsala,\r\nSweden, in 1778. His herbarium after his death was sold and finally\r\nbecame the property of the Linnaean Society of London, where the\r\nspecimens are frequently used by botanists from various parts of the\r\nworld for purposes of comparison.\r\n\r\n[152] Husmann, =1895=:189.\r\n\r\n[153] _Grape Cult._, =1=:4. 1869.\r\n\r\n[154] _U.

Besides being a physician he worked\r\nwith many different plants, producing new varieties of cotton, peach,\r\nnectarine, magnolia and other species. His hybrids were produced chiefly\r\nduring the sixties and early seventies. His method of testing hybrid\r\ngrapes was unique; as soon as the fruit from the cross-fertilized\r\nblossoms ripened, the seeds were planted and the seedlings forced the\r\nfirst winter in a hothouse. In the spring it was planted by the side of\r\na mature vine outside and the seedling grafted by inarching on the\r\nestablished vine. In this manner, his son writes us, he frequently\r\nsecured fruit the second summer. In 1873 he suffered the irreparable\r\nmisfortune of losing his residence by fire. This destroyed all of his\r\nseeds and also his seedlings, which were in an adjacent hothouse. The\r\nnumber of Dr. Wylie's grape seedlings cannot be accurately told as many\r\nof them were never disseminated. Of his better known sorts there are\r\nBerckmans, Dr. Wylie, Mrs. McClure, and Peter Wylie, the best known of\r\nwhich is the first. Dr. Wylie was the first man to hybridize the _Vitis\r\nrotundifolia_ with other species of grapes. Unfortunately these hybrids\r\nappear to have been lost to cultivation. He died at his home in Chester,\r\nSouth Carolina, in 1877.\r\n\r\n[163] _Tex. Sta. Bul._, =48=:1153. 1898.\r\n\r\n[164] _Mag. Hort._, =1863=:67.\r\n\r\n[165] Fuller, =1867=:237.\r\n\r\n[166] _Bush.

He early\r\nengaged in the nursery business and about 1860 began to experiment in\r\nhybridizing grapes, his first production of note being Diana Hamburg\r\nwhich proved too tender to be of value in New York. In 1873 he sold the\r\nBrighton to its introducer, the grape having come from a union of Diana\r\nHamburg and Concord. In 1882 Moore's third grape of note, the Diamond,\r\nwas introduced, its parents being Concord, fertilized by Iona. One other\r\ngrape completes his list of varieties of this fruit--the Geneva, a\r\nVinifera-Labrusca hybrid from seed planted in the spring of 1874. Beside\r\nthese grapes, Moore was the originator of the Ruby, Red Cross and\r\nDiploma currants and the Bar-seckel pear. Jacob Moore died in January,\r\n1908, having devoted a life to the improvement of fruits and having\r\nspent a patrimony of no small amount and all of his earnings in carrying\r\non experiments in horticulture. It saddens one to know that after having\r\ndevoted a half century to the enrichment of agriculture, poor Moore\r\nshould have passed his last years in comparative poverty, and that they\r\nwere embittered with the thought that, unlike the inventor, the producer\r\nof new fruits can in no way protect the products of his originality,\r\neven though they added millions to the wealth of the country as have his\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\n[169] Advertising circular sent out by Wm. B. Brown in 1899.\r\n\r\n[170] George W. Campbell was born in Cortlandville, New York, in 1817.\r\nThe family moved to Ohio in 1821. In early life Campbell was a printer\r\nand editor, as his father had been before him. In 1849 he moved from\r\nSandusky, Ohio, to Delaware in the same State and it was in the latter\r\nplace that his attention was first turned to horticulture as a\r\nlivelihood, although he had been interested in it as an amateur much\r\nearlier. He was a continuous member of the American Pomological Society\r\nfrom the time of its organization in 1850 until his death. He raised\r\nthousands of seedling grapes, of which the following were given names:\r\nCampbell Early, Concord Chasselas, Concord Muscat, Juno, Lady, Purity,\r\nTriumph, White Delaware. All of these are practically obsolete in the\r\nNorth except Campbell Early and Lady.\r\n\r\nCampbell died at his home in Delaware, Ohio, in 1898. For many years\r\nbefore his death he had been the leading writer and speaker in the North\r\non the culture of the grape and on grape-breeding, and his work had a\r\nmarked influence on the improvement of viticulture.\r\n\r\n[171] Charles Arnold was born in Bedfordshire, England, in 1818. In 1833\r\nhe removed to Paris, Ontario. He was an enthusiastic hybridizer in many\r\nlines, producing a white wheat, the Ontario apple, and the American\r\nWonder pea. In 1853 he established the Paris Nurseries. Of his numerous\r\nseedling grapes he gave names to Autuchon, Brant, Canada, Cornucopia and\r\nOthello. He was for many years prominent in the agricultural and\r\nscientific associations of his adopted country. His object in crossing\r\ngrapes was to secure varieties sufficiently hardy and early for the\r\nCanadian climate. In this he was in a measure successful but his crosses\r\nare so susceptible to mildew and rot that their culture has been\r\ngenerally abandoned in both Canada and the United States. He died at his\r\nhome in Paris, Canada, in 1883.\r\n\r\n[172] _Cat._, =1908=:18.\r\n\r\n[173] Ephraim W. Bull was born in Concord, Massachusetts, in 1805 and\r\ndied in 1895. He will long be remembered by grape-growers as the\r\noriginator and introducer of the Concord grape, the history of which is\r\ngiven in the above account of that variety. Bull grew many other\r\nseedlings, none of which attained a reputation among growers unless it\r\nbe Cottage. Ephraim Bull's ninety years were spent in the quiet of his\r\nConcord home and he would have remained unknown by others than his\r\nneighbors, who honored and loved him, had it not been for his fortunate\r\ndiscovery of the Concord grape, which must always give him a place in\r\nthe history of American grape culture. The grape which has added\r\nimmensely to the wealth of a nation, brought its originator scarcely a\r\nyear's competence. As a partial recompense for his great service to\r\nhorticulture and to the nation, the memory of Ephraim W. Bull should\r\nlive long.\r\n\r\n[174] No one family has furnished so many members who have been\r\nprominent in American grape-growing as the Underhills. The first of this\r\nremarkable family, Robert Underhill, was born in Yorktown, Westchester\r\nCounty, New York, in 1761. During his early life he appears to have been\r\nengaged in various enterprises. At one time he was part owner and\r\nconductor of a flouring mill at the head of navigation on the Croton\r\nRiver; later he sold his interest in this business and in 1804 removed\r\nto Croton Point, which he had previously bought. Here, during the War of\r\n1812, the supply of watermelons from the South being cut off, he planted\r\neighty acres of melons, and it is said that as many as six vessels were\r\nlying off Croton Point at one time waiting for the melons to mature.\r\nAmong other of his ventures was the growing of castor beans, and toward\r\nthe end of his life he became interested in viticulture. An account of\r\nhis operations cultivating grapes is given in the first part of this\r\nwork. Robert Underhill died at Croton Point in 1829. After his death his\r\ntwo sons, William Alexander Underhill and Robert T. Underhill, bought\r\nfrom their father's estate the two hundred and fifty acres comprising\r\nCroton Point. Their holdings were not in common, William A. Underhill\r\nhaving about one hundred and sixty-five acres and his brother the\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nR. T. Underhill was born on the Croton River in 1802 and died in 1871 at\r\nCroton Point. William A. Underhill was born at the same place as his\r\nbrother in 1804, and died suddenly while on a trip to New York City in\r\n1873. The first three Underhills were pioneer vineyardists in this\r\nState, and were men of great enterprise and initiative, contributing\r\nmuch to American viticulture by precept and example; but none of them\r\nwas an originator of new varieties.\r\n\r\nStephen W. Underhill, son of William A. Underhill, was born at Croton\r\nPoint in 1837. In his boyhood he became familiar with the grape-growing\r\noperations of his father and uncle, and about 1860 became interested in\r\nhybridizing as a means of originating new varieties. Most of his work\r\nwas done between 1860 and 1870. He originated Black Defiance, Black\r\nEagle, Croton, Irving, Senasqua and many other named and unnamed sorts.\r\nOf his varieties it may be said that they generally show too many\r\nVinifera weaknesses for profitable commercial sorts. S. W. Underhill is\r\nstill living at Croton-on-Hudson, a short distance from Croton Point,\r\nthe scene of the labors of three generations of the Underhill family.\r\nSince the death of his father, in 1873, he has devoted himself almost\r\nexclusively to brick-making, an occupation in which his father had been\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n[175] _Bush. Cat._, =1883=:89.\r\n\r\n[176] _Traité gen. de vit._, =6=:278. 1903.\r\n\r\n[177] _Ib._, p. 279.\r\n\r\n[178] The grape vine in the vineyard is not ornamental, but only because\r\nits beauty is marred by the formal shapes in which it must be trained to\r\nmeet the purposes of the cultivator. But as a festoon for an arbor, or\r\nfor hiding a neglected building, for the porch of the farmhouse, or for\r\nany place where a bold or picturesque effect is wanted, or for giving an\r\nexpression of strength, no vine surpasses some of the varieties of our\r\nnative grapes. Properly planted they are not only beautiful in\r\nthemselves but attractive through their suggestiveness. To sit under\r\none's own vine and fig tree is the ancient idea of a life of peace,\r\ncontentment and security; and this association with the patriarchal use\r\nof the vine is one of the charms of the grape.\r\n\r\n[179] Often incorrectly spelled Devereux.\r\n\r\n[180] _Horticulturist_, =12=:458. 1857.\r\n\r\n[181] _Gar. Mon._, =2=:265. 1860.\r\n\r\n[182] _Bush. Cat._, =1894=:116.\r\n\r\n[183] After the above was in type we received a communication from\r\nRicketts stating that Downing came from seed of Concord fertilized by\r\nMuscat Hamburg. If this is true it is difficult to account for the\r\napparent Aestivalis characters.\r\n\r\n[184] This variety was named after Dutchess County, New York, and the\r\nspelling is as given in this text and not \"Duchess\" as usually spelled.\r\n\r\n[185] Andrew Jackson Caywood was born near Modena, Ulster County, New\r\nYork, in 1819. During his early life he was a mason and contractor and\r\nengaged in building operations in Orange and Ulster counties. When about\r\ntwenty-five years of age he became interested in fruit culture and was\r\nsoon one of the leading fruit-growers in his section. Caywood's\r\ngrape-breeding work appears to have started about 1850, while he still\r\nlived at Modena. In 1861 he removed to Poughkeepsie, and about 1865,\r\nwhat was probably his first grape, the Walter, was brought to the\r\nattention of the public. In 1877 he removed to Marlboro, where for many\r\nyears he conducted a nursery business in connection with fruit raising,\r\nfirst under the firm name of Ferries & Caywood, and later as Caywood &\r\nSon, his son Walter having entered the business. Caywood's last years\r\nwere clouded with financial troubles and failing health. In 1889 he died\r\nat his home in Marlboro. No record is available of Caywood's productions\r\nnor his manner of work. He appears to have differed from the\r\ngrape-breeders of his day in that he produced second rather than first\r\ngeneration hybrids. Of these his most important productions are:\r\nDutchess, Metternich, Nectar, Poughkeepsie, Ulster and Walter, though he\r\nraised many others, most of which were never named nor disseminated.\r\nCaywood's years of unremitting labor in improving grapes will long make\r\nhis name prominent in American viticulture.\r\n\r\n[186] John Burr was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 1800. In early\r\nlife he removed to Ohio, where, although he was engaged in mercantile\r\npursuits, he passed his leisure time in experimenting with strawberries.\r\nIn this work he was quite successful, producing Burr's Pine and Burr's\r\nSeedling, once popular sorts. In 1858 Burr moved to Kansas and soon\r\nafter began breeding grapes. For this work he was a believer in natural\r\npollination and planted the varieties which he desired to use as parents\r\nin close proximity that they might pollinate each other. Burr at first\r\nused Concord, Hartford, Isabella, and other grapes of this class as\r\nparents, but later he destroyed all of the seedlings of these and used\r\nDelaware, Goethe, Salem, Catawba, and other Vinifera hybrids. He did not\r\ntake trouble to note from which variety the seed came but mixed and\r\nplanted all together. The records of the parentage of his productions\r\nare consequently usually unsatisfactory. Most of his grape productions\r\nwere introduced to the public by Stayman & Black, a nearby nursery firm.\r\nOf Burr's many seedlings he gave names to the following: Cochee, Early\r\nVictor, Eclipse, Evaline, Ideal, Iola, Jewel, Magnate, Matchless,\r\nMendota, Omega, Osage, Osee, Paragon, Peola, Primate, Pulasky, Seneca,\r\nSuperior, Standard, Supreme, and White Jewel. Burr died at his home in\r\nLeavenworth, Kansas, in 1892.\r\n\r\n[187] _Traité gen. de vit._, =6=:192. 1903.\r\n\r\n[188] _Cat._, =1907-8=:18.\r\n\r\n[189] This variety was named Glenfeld by Mr. Magee, its originator, not\r\nGlenfield as it is frequently spelled.\r\n\r\n[190] _Tex. Sta. Bul._, =56=:267. 1900.\r\n\r\n[191] Munson regards them as identical.\r\n\r\n[192] Dr. C. W. Grant was born in Litchfield, Connecticut, in 1810.\r\nEarly in life he became a Doctor of Medicine but soon became\r\ndissatisfied with that profession as it was then practiced, and entered\r\ndentistry. He settled in Newburgh, New York, where he built up a very\r\nlarge dental practice. Dr. Grant was an enthusiastic amateur\r\nhorticulturist and numbered among his friends such men of national note\r\nas A. J. and Charles Downing, Horace Greeley, Henry Ward Beecher, W. C.\r\nBryant, Donald G. Mitchell and others like these who were interested in\r\nrural pursuits. He bought Iona Island in the Hudson River and planted\r\nthereon a commercial vineyard. On the death of his wife in 1856 he gave\r\nup his dental practice and took up his residence on Iona Island. Here\r\nfor twelve years he grew grapes and conducted a grape nursery.\r\nUnfortunately Dr. Grant's business experience was not such as to enable\r\nhim to make a success of a commercial nursery. In 1868 he retired from\r\nactive pursuits and returned to his old home at Litchfield, where he\r\ndied in 1881. Dr. Grant's chief interest to grape-growers lies in the\r\nfact that he was the originator of Iona and Israella and the introducer\r\nof Anna and Eumelan. He was one of the first and a most ardent\r\ngrape-breeder, working especially toward improving the quality of\r\ncommercial varieties of grapes.\r\n\r\n[193] On account of criticisms of the justice of the award, Grant\r\nreturned the prize to be competed for a second time. At the second trial\r\nit went to Concord on vine characters.\r\n\r\n[194] _Sou. Agr._, =2=:552. 1829.\r\n\r\n[195] In 1889 Munson sent out a grape under the name Jaeger and in 1890\r\nhe introduced the variety here described under the name Hermann Jaeger,\r\nat the same time withdrawing the former variety from further\r\ndissemination. As the first named Jaeger is apparently obsolete there\r\nseems to be no objection to shortening the name so as to conform in\r\nnomenclature with the recommendations of the American Pomological\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n[196] James H. Ricketts was born in Oldbridge, Middlesex County,\r\nMassachusetts, in 1830, the family moving to Indiana while Ricketts was\r\nstill a child. When a young man Ricketts learned the trade of\r\nbookbinding in Cincinnati and later practiced this art in New York City.\r\nIn 1857 he established a bookbinding business at Newburgh, New York;\r\nhere he became interested in raising fruit, devoting to it such time as\r\ncould be be spared from his business. In 1861 he started his work in\r\ngrape improvement, reading all the books then published on this subject\r\nin order to prepare himself to carry on the work intelligently. His\r\nfirst production was Raritan which he says he thought not much\r\nimprovement. In 1862, he built a glass house in order that he might have\r\nVinifera vines for crossing with natives outside. His first production\r\nof foreign cross-breeds was the Charles Downing, now known as Downing.\r\n\r\nRicketts produced many hundred seedlings, and for ten or twelve years\r\nexhibited them at various fairs, horticultural society meetings and\r\nother places, where their magnificent appearance and fine flavor\r\nattracted universal and favorable attention and made him the recipient\r\nof many medals and prizes. Unfortunately Ricketts, like many other\r\nAmerican grape-breeders, fell into financial difficulties, and in 1877\r\nlost his vineyard and home by foreclosure. In 1888, he moved to\r\nWashington, D. C., to work at his trade but has again started to improve\r\ngrapes and is now growing a number of new varieties which will probably\r\nbe shown to the public in the near future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEFFERSON]\r\n\r\nRicketts' seedlings are characterized by a large size of bunch and\r\nberry, and by high quality. Unfortunately it has been the experience of\r\ngrowers in nearly all grape regions that the vine characters of his\r\nvarieties are not equal to those of the fruit, the vines being subject\r\nto mildew and other Vinifera weaknesses. However, Ricketts produced\r\nmagnificent specimens of his grapes, year after year, under conditions\r\nwhich every one admits were less favorable than those of the average\r\ngrape-grower. The secret of his success seems never to have been\r\ndiscovered. This anomaly is so striking that Campbell did not hesitate\r\nto suggest that the fault was with the American grape-grower rather than\r\nwith Ricketts' grapes or the location of the vineyard. The best known of\r\nhis varieties are: Advance, Bacchus, Don Juan, Downing, Eldorado, Empire\r\nState, Highland, Jefferson, Lady Washington and Secretary. Besides these\r\nhe produced many others, some of which were named but many of which were\r\nknown only under numbers.\r\n\r\n[197] _Amer. Farmer_, =11=:237, 412. 1829-30.\r\n\r\n[198] The illustrations in _The Grapes of New York_, unless otherwise\r\nmentioned, are life-size; but it must be remembered that when objects\r\nhaving three dimensions are reproduced on a flat surface there is\r\nseemingly a considerable reduction in size. Allowance should be made for\r\nthis illusion in comparing fruit with illustration.\r\n\r\n[199] _Bush. Cat._, =1883=:120.\r\n\r\n[200] Downing, =1857=:341.\r\n\r\n[201] Pronounced Reezling.\r\n\r\n[202] Jacob Rommel was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1837. The\r\nfamily moved to Hermann, Missouri, in 1838 where his father, Jacob\r\nRommel, Sr., engaged in the nursery business and became interested in\r\ngrape-growing and wine-making. In 1860 the younger Rommel removed to\r\nMorrison where he entered into partnership with H. Sobbe to grow nursery\r\nstock and cultivate grapes. At this time much dissatisfaction was felt\r\namong the grape-growers of the Middle West with the standard varieties\r\nthen grown, most of which were table grapes secured from the East, and\r\nwere poorly adapted to wine-making and to Missouri conditions. To remedy\r\nthis defect Rommel originated many new varieties, using Taylor chiefly\r\nas a parent. Among others he produced Amber, Beauty, Black Delaware,\r\nElvira, Etta, Faith, Montefiore, Pearl, Transparent and Wilding.\r\nRommel's seedlings are characterized by extreme vigor and\r\nproductiveness. They were not designed for table grapes and they lack\r\nthe qualities to recommend them as such. In 1900 Rommel retired from\r\nbusiness and removed to Chamois, Missouri, where he still lives.\r\n\r\n[203] Nelson Bonney White was born in the town of Putney, Windham\r\nCounty, Vermont, in 1824. During his younger years he lived for a time\r\nin Ohio and in New York but finally settled in Norwood, Massachusetts.\r\nWhite was a cabinet maker by trade, but coming under the influence of E.\r\nS. Rogers at the time when Rogers' hybrids were causing a stir in New\r\nEngland, he took up grape-breeding as a pastime. He is probably the\r\noldest grape-breeder of note now alive, as he has been engaged in this\r\noccupation over fifty years. His best known productions are August\r\nGiant, Amber Queen, and Norfolk. Two other of his varieties,\r\nInternational and King Philip, are very highly spoken of but have not\r\nyet been distributed.\r\n\r\n[204] _Horticulturist_, =16=:286. 1861.\r\n\r\n[205] _Mag. Hort._, =9=:430. 1843.\r\n\r\n[206] _Traité gen. de vit._, =6=:166. 1903.\r\n\r\n[207] _U. S. Pat. Off. Rpt._, =1855=:308.\r\n\r\n[208] A. J. Caywood, of Marlboro, New York, published the claim that\r\nthis variety was originated by him, that he had named it Hudson but had\r\ndelayed sending it out on the advice of several grape experts till it\r\nhad been further tested. For this purpose Caywood says he sent the\r\nvariety to about sixty men, among them J. W. Prentiss. Those who\r\nexamined fruit from the two original vines said they were certainly very\r\nsimilar if not identical.\r\n\r\n[209] Edward Staniford Rogers was born in the old family mansion on\r\nEssex Street, Salem, Massachusetts, June 28, 1826, and died in Peabody,\r\nMassachusetts, March 29, 1899. He was the son of Nathaniel Leverett\r\nRogers, an old-time Salem merchant, who, with his brothers John and\r\nRichard, was engaged in the maritime trade. Edward Rogers was educated\r\nin Master Ira Cheever's school, a famous Salem school of the day, and,\r\nlater, he made several voyages in his father's ships as clerk and\r\nsupercargo and, finally, passed a number of years in the counting-room\r\nof the firm in Salem. After his father's death, Mr. Rogers lived in the\r\nold family home with his brother and their mother, and in the garden\r\nback of the house, quite large for a city lot, he indulged his natural\r\ntaste for horticulture and conducted his experiments in grape\r\nhybridization.\r\n\r\nBy temperament Mr. Rogers was quiet and retiring and so generous that he\r\ngained practically no profit from his horticultural productions, for he\r\nfreely gave cuttings and rooted plants of the hybrids he raised to\r\nfriends and visitors before his own stock was by any means large. Mr.\r\nRogers possessed literary ability and was an extensive reader, but could\r\nrarely be drawn into conversation excepting among his most intimate\r\nfriends who were wont to \"drop in\" at his long, low greenhouse in the\r\ngarden or at his office, extemporized in the old colonial barn at the\r\nrear of the house. After the death of his mother the old house was sold\r\nand the brothers removed to another house in Salem and some years later,\r\nafter the death of his brother, Mr. Rogers bought the place, his last\r\nhome, in Peabody, Massachusetts, where he cultivated trees and flowers\r\nfor pleasure and experiment. An accident which resulted in a permanent\r\nlameness prevented much physical labor during his last years and\r\nprobably in a measure hastened his death.\r\n\r\n[210] In the eastern portion of the Southern States, the section where\r\nthis variety originated and where it is still most largely grown,\r\nScuppernong is applied only to a white variety of _Vitis rotundifolia_.\r\nUnfortunately in many portions of the South and in the North, the word\r\nScuppernong is apparently taken as meaning a grape of the southern Fox\r\nor Rotundifolia class; thus we find some writers using such\r\ncontradictory expressions as White Scuppernong, Green Scuppernong, and\r\nBlack Scuppernong. In the South, at least, this use of the term appears\r\nto have arisen in the last fifty years, usage previous to that time\r\nbeing practically unanimous in recognizing that the Scuppernong was the\r\nwhite Rotundifolia which had been selected at an early day for\r\ncultivation on account of certain superior cultural characters\r\ndistinguishing it from the rest of the species.\r\n\r\n[211] _Amer. Farmer_, =3=:332. 1822.\r\n\r\n[212] _S. C. Sta. Bul._, =132=:17, 18. 1907.\r\n\r\n[213] Dr. Joseph Stayman was born in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, in\r\n1817. The family was of German descent and had long been identified with\r\nthe Mennonites of the region of his birthplace. Stayman's father was a\r\nfarmer and miller and during early life the son was engaged in these\r\noccupations. In 1839 he accompanied his parents to Ohio, where he was\r\nengaged in the milling business with his father for a time and later\r\nentered the lecture field and studied medicine. In 1849 he married and\r\nestablished his home in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, removing two years later\r\nto Abingdon, Illinois. For several years he practiced medicine but in\r\n1858 purchased a nursery which was the beginning of his connection with\r\nthe fruit business. In 1860 he removed to Leavenworth, Kansas, where he\r\nlived the remainder of his life, dying at his home in that city in 1903.\r\n\r\nDr. Stayman was a man of great originality and had varied interests. In\r\nplant-breeding he worked with strawberries, apples, raspberries and\r\ngrapes, producing among others the Clyde strawberry, the Stayman apple\r\nand a host of varieties of grapes. Of his named sorts of grapes there\r\nare: Black Imperial, Cherokee, Concordia, Daisy, Darwin, Exquisite,\r\nMarsala, Mary Mark, Mrs. Stayman, Osceola, Oscaloosa, Oswego, Ozark,\r\nPawnee, Perfection, Prolific, Snowflake, White Beauty, White Cloud and\r\nWhite Imperial.\r\n\r\nStayman and John Burr were neighbors and friends, and held similar\r\nopinions as to the best methods of procedure in originating new\r\nvarieties. Neither believed in artificial pollination but grew the\r\nseveral varieties from which crosses were desired in close proximity and\r\nthen planted seed from the best developed fruits. Their methods\r\ncertainly gave them varieties with a high standard of excellence.\r\nStayman may be regarded as one of the leading viticulturists of the\r\nGreat Plains region. He was, too, one of the pioneers of America in\r\nbreeding fruits. His many contributions to our lists of fruits make his\r\nname memorable to fruit-growers and lovers of fine fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTypographical errors corrected by the etext transcriber:\r\n\r\nsuspectible=> susceptible {pg 136}\r\n\r\nwhile the the chalaza=> while the chalaza {pg 119}\r\n\r\nsuceptible=> sucseptible {pg 228}\r\n\r\nMust 888=> Must 88° {pg 261}\r\n\r\nMust 808=> Must 80° {pg 314}\r\n\r\n1889 and it still retained=> 1889 and is still retained {pg 329}\r\n\r\npossiby=> possibly {pg 346}\r\n\r\napperance=> appearance {pg 469}\r\n\r\ngoverment=> government {pg 521}\r\n\r\nMunson' scrosses=> Munson's crosses {pg 493}\r\n\r\nenlongated=> elongated {pg 500}\r\n\r\nBrillant, 193=> Brilliant, 193 {pg 540 index}\r\n\r\nselfsterility of, 104;=> self-sterility of, 104; {pg 546 index}\r\n\r\nmeans of dstribution of, 27;=> means of distribution of, 27; {pg 553}",
