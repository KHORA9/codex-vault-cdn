For\r\ngeneral distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the serious pests in orchards and tree plantations are the several\r\nnative species of rabbits. These animals do considerable damage to\r\ngarden truck and other farm crops also, especially on lands recently\r\nopened to cultivation. North American rabbits belong to two general\r\nclasses easily distinguished by their size and habits.\r\n\r\nThe larger forms[1] include the arctic and varying hares, or snowshoe\r\nrabbits, and the jack rabbits, and are found throughout nearly all of\r\nAlaska and Canada and in all the States west of the Mississippi except\r\nArkansas and Louisiana. East of the Mississippi they inhabit the\r\nnorthern parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, most of New York\r\nand New England, and southward in the Appalachian Mountains, parts of\r\nPennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Genus _Lepus_.]\r\n\r\nThe smaller forms,[2] generally called \"cottontail rabbits,\" occur in\r\nevery State, but are absent from the greater part of Maine, the\r\nnorthern parts of New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Michigan, Wisconsin,\r\nand Minnesota, and from the western parts of Washington and Oregon. In\r\nrecent years they have extended their range northward in the New England\r\nStates, New York, and portions of the West, and have invaded and\r\noccupied a considerable part of the Province of Ontario. In habits they\r\ndiffer materially from the larger rabbits. They live in copses and\r\nthickets more than in open fields. The young are born blind, naked, and\r\nhelpless, while those of the larger rabbits have the eyes open, are\r\npartially furred, and active when born.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Genus _Sylvilagus_.]\r\n\r\nRabbits of both genera, however, feed exclusively on vegetation, and are\r\nat times harmful to crops and especially to trees. Because of their size\r\nand great abundance in parts of their range, jack rabbits are by far the\r\nmost destructive, but, except in a few places where they have been\r\nintroduced, none are found east of the Mississippi. Epizootics (diseases\r\nwhich attack many animals at the same time) are an effectual natural\r\ncheck, and after such attack occurs, jack rabbits are usually so reduced\r\nin numbers that they are not troublesome again for several years.\r\n\r\nTraps and other devices that are effective with cottontail rabbits do\r\nnot always succeed with jack rabbits. The recommendations contained in\r\nthis bulletin will, therefore, apply only to cottontail rabbits, but\r\nthey may suggest methods that, with modifications, may be used against\r\nthe larger forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS OF COTTONTAIL RABBITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCottontail rabbits (fig. 1) are so well known that little need be said\r\nof their habits. They breed several times each year during the warmer\r\nmonths, the litters averaging five or six young. The nest is usually\r\nplaced in a hollow or depression of the ground, often in open fields or\r\nmeadows. It is composed of dead grass and warmly lined with fur which\r\nthe female pulls from her own body. The male rabbit takes no part in\r\ncaring for the young, and the female weans them as soon as they are able\r\nto leave the nest. These animals breed so rapidly that in spite of many\r\nnatural enemies, and of the fact that they are hunted for human food,\r\nthey often become numerous enough to inflict serious losses on farmers\r\nand fruit growers in many parts of the United States (fig. 2).\r\n\r\nCottontail rabbits eat all sorts of herbage--leaves, stems, flowers, and\r\nseeds of herbaceous plants and grasses--and leaves, buds, bark, and\r\nfruits of woody plants or trees. They usually prefer the most succulent\r\nfoods, as young shoots, tender garden vegetables, clover, alfalfa, and\r\nfallen ripe fruits; but they exhibit also a remarkable delicacy of\r\ntaste in their selection of certain varieties of cultivated plants and\r\nin their neglect of others of the same species. Prof. C. V. Piper\r\nreports that in Oregon rabbits ate Arabian alfalfa down to the ground,\r\nwhile they did little or no damage to other varieties grown in\r\nsurrounding plats. Prof. C. A. Mooers, of the Tennessee Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station, reports similar observations in regard to their\r\ntaste for soy beans, stating that they greatly relish the mammoth yellow\r\nvariety and that it is practically the only one that suffers from their\r\ndepredations. When favorite foods are absent rabbits resort to whatever\r\nis available. It is during summer droughts or when deep snows cut off\r\nordinary supplies that the animals attack the bark of growing trees or\r\nshrubs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 1.--Cottontail rabbit in its \"form.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION OF RABBITS.\r\n\r\nCottontail rabbits are valuable for food and afford excellent sport for\r\ngunners. In many States, especially east of the Mississippi River, they\r\nare protected as game. In fruit-growing and truck-farming districts\r\nfarmers regard them with disfavor, and there is considerable rivalry\r\nbetween sportsmen and farmers to have their opposing views reflected in\r\ngame laws. The interests of the two classes do not seriously differ,\r\nhowever, for when rabbits are closely hunted losses from their\r\ndepredations are usually reduced to a minimum. Still there is danger\r\nthat in years favorable for their increase the animals may inflict\r\nserious injury to trees during severe winters.\r\n\r\nRabbits are protected (1915) by close seasons in States and Provinces as\r\nshown in Table I. Twenty-eight States, Alaska, and the Canadian\r\nProvinces not mentioned in the table do not protect rabbits of any kind.\r\nIn the District of Columbia all shooting is prohibited except on certain\r\nriver marshes. In Kentucky rabbits may be taken with dog, trap, or snare\r\nat any time, and the close season for shooting is evidently solely for\r\nthe purpose of keeping gunners out of fields and woods during the two\r\nmonths immediately preceding the open season for quails. In Wisconsin 46\r\ncounties, mostly in the southern half of the State, have no close season\r\nfor rabbits. In California only cottontails, or bush rabbits, are\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 2.--Apple tree killed by rabbits.]\r\n\r\nTABLE I.--_Lengths of open season for rabbits or hares._\r\n\r\n----------------------+-----------+-----------+---------\r\n                      | Beginning | Beginning | Length\r\nState or Province.    | of        | of        | of open\r\n                      | open      | close     | season.\r\n                      | season.   | season.   |\r\n----------------------+-----------+-----------+---------\r\n                      |           |           | _Months._\r\nMaine                 | Oct. 1    | Apr. 1    |  6\r\nNew Hampshire         | do.       | Mar. 1    |  5\r\nVermont               | Sept. 15  | do.       |  5-1/2\r\nMassachusetts         | Oct. 12   | do.       |  4-3/5\r\nRhode Island          | Nov. 1    | Jan. 1    |  2\r\nConnecticut           | Oct. 8    | do.       |  2-3/4\r\nNew York              | Oct. 1    | Feb. 1    |  4\r\n  Long Island         | Nov. 1    | Jan. 1    |  2\r\nNew Jersey            | Nov. 10   | Dec. 16   |  1-1/5\r\nPennsylvania          | Nov. 1    | Dec. 1    |  1\r\nDelaware              | Nov. 15   | Jan. 1    |  1-1/2\r\nMaryland              | Nov. 10   | Dec. 25   |  1-1/2\r\nDistrict of Columbia  | Nov. 1    | Feb. 1    |  3\r\nVirginia              | do.       | do.       |  3\r\nKentucky              | Nov. 15   | Sept. 15  | 10\r\nOhio                  | do.       | Dec. 5    |  2/3\r\nIndiana               | Apr. 1    | Jan. 10   |  9-1/3\r\nIllinois              | Aug. 31   | Feb. 1    |  5-1/30\r\nMichigan              | Oct. 1    | Mar. 2    |  5-1/30\r\nWisconsin:            |           |           |\r\n  6 counties          | Sept. 10  | Feb. 1    |  4-2/3\r\n  13 counties         | Oct. 10   | do.       |  3-2/3\r\n  6 counties          | Nov. 1    | Jan. 1    |  2\r\nColorado              | Oct. 1    | Mar. 1    |  5\r\nCalifornia            | July 31   | Feb. 1    |  6-1/30\r\nBritish Columbia      | Sept. 1   | Jan. 1    |  4\r\nOntario               | Oct. 1    | Dec. 16   |  2-1/2\r\nQuebec:               |           |           |\r\n  Zone 1              | Oct. 15   | Feb. 1    |  3-1/2\r\n  Zone 2              | do.       | Mar. 1    |  4-1/2\r\nNewfoundland          | Sept. 20  | Jan. 1    |  3-1/3\r\nPrince Edward Island  | Nov. 1    | Feb. 1    |  3\r\nNova Scotia           | Oct. 1    | Mar. 1    |  5\r\n----------------------+-----------+-----------+---------\r\n\r\nIn about half the States that have a close season for rabbits the laws\r\npermit farmers and fruit growers to destroy the animals to protect crops\r\nor trees. Such provision might well be incorporated in game laws of all\r\nStates. For lack of it farmers have sometimes suffered severe losses,\r\nand not a few have been compelled to pay fines for trying to protect\r\ntheir property from rabbits. In States that protect rabbits it is well\r\nfor the farmer to be acquainted with the game laws and in case of doubt\r\nto have a clear understanding with local and State game, wardens before\r\nundertaking to destroy rabbits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANS OF REPRESSING RABBITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL ENEMIES.\r\n\r\nAmong the agencies that help to keep down the numbers of rabbits few are\r\nmore effective than carnivorous birds and mammals. These include large\r\nhawks and owls, eagles, coyotes, wildcats, foxes, minks, weasels, dogs,\r\nand cats. Eagles, the larger species of hawks, and all the large and\r\nmedium-sized owls make rabbits a great part of their food. From the\r\nstandpoint of the farmer and fruit grower these birds and certain\r\ncarnivorous mammals are far more beneficial than harmful. On the other\r\nhand, poultry growers and sportsmen regard them as enemies to be\r\ndestroyed whenever possible. In the absence of such natural enemies,\r\nrabbits, as well as rats and mice, often become a menace to valuable\r\ncrops. Indiscriminate slaughter of carnivorous birds and mammals should\r\nbe suppressed whenever rodent pests are to be controlled.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTING.\r\n\r\nHunting has been the most important factor in keeping down the numbers\r\nof rabbits in America. In some parts of the country the animals have\r\nbeen so reduced in numbers by shooting that sportsmen have invoked\r\nlegislation to prevent their extermination. Shooting is undoubtedly the\r\nbest method for hunting this animal. Ferreting is often impracticable,\r\nsince our native rabbits do not habitually burrow; besides, the use of\r\nferrets is forbidden by law in many States that protect the rabbit.\r\nCoursing with greyhounds is popular in the West, where the swifter jack\r\nrabbits are abundant. Cottontails are often chased with foxhounds, but\r\nthe beagle is rapidly taking precedence as a favorite for hunting these\r\nanimals, the gun being used to secure the game.\r\n\r\nWhere the country is sufficiently open for the purpose, the organized\r\nhunt, in which everyone who owns a gun is supposed to take part, is a\r\ngood means of reducing the number of rabbits. These organized hunts are\r\npopular in the West, where they are also varied, in the case of jack\r\nrabbits, by what is known as the \"rabbit drive.\" A large territory is\r\nsurrounded by men and the animals are driven into a corral built of wire\r\nnetting. While a few cottontails are sometimes included in the catch,\r\nthese usually find refuge in open burrows or under cover of rocks or\r\nbrush, so that this method is hardly applicable to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAPPING.\r\n\r\nRabbits are easily trapped or snared, and while these methods of taking\r\nthem are slow, they are always feasible when cottontails infest woodlot,\r\norchard, nursery, field, or garden. Many are caught in old-fashioned box\r\ntraps set with a figure-4 trigger with cord attached to hold up the box\r\nlid.\r\n\r\nAn improvement on this familiar trap, widely used in the Middle West,\r\nand often called the Wellhouse[3] trap, is a box 21 inches long and\r\nabout 6 inches high and 4 inches wide (inside measurements) made of\r\n6-inch fence boards, preferably old ones. The box is closed at the rear\r\nand has a wire door in front which swings inward from the top, a cleat\r\nat the bottom preventing its opening outward. The trap is set and the\r\nwire door kept open by a wire trigger-rod held in place by two staples\r\nin the top of the box. The trigger-rod is bent downward into a loop or\r\nfigure 8 near the rear of the trap. As the rabbit enters the trap and\r\ncrowds into the back part it presses against the loop, moves the\r\ntrigger-rod backward and is imprisoned as the wire door is released and\r\nfalls. Bait may be used but is unnecessary, since cottontails frequently\r\ntake refuge in dark places from enemies or inclement weather.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: After the late Mr. Fred Wellhouse, of Topeka, Kans.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Details of a Wellhouse rabbit trap.]\r\n\r\nThe materials needed for making a Wellhouse trap are: Four boards 1 by\r\n6, 21 inches long, for the sides; a piece 1 by 6, 8 inches long, for the\r\nback; a small cleat for the door stop; 28-1/2 inches of wire for the\r\ndoor; 22 inches of wire for the trigger; 4 small staples for hanging the\r\ndoor and trigger; and nails (fig. 3).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Cross section of a Walmsley tile trap for\r\nrabbits.]\r\n\r\nMr. J. M. Walmsley recently sent to the department photographs and a\r\ndescription of a permanent rabbit trap made of sewer tile and used on\r\nhis and other farms in Kansas (fig. 4). A 12 by 6 inch \"tee\" is set with\r\nthe long end downward and buried so that the 6-inch opening is below the\r\nsurface of the ground. Two lengths of 6-inch sewer pipe are then\r\nconnected horizontally with the opening. Soil is placed over the joints\r\nto exclude light. The upright tile should be fitted with a tight\r\nremovable cover--Mr. Walmsley uses old harrow disks for the purpose. The\r\nprojecting end of the small tile is surrounded with rocks, brush, or\r\nwood, so as to make the hole look inviting to rabbits (fig. 5), and that\r\nthey may appropriate the den as a place of concealment and shelter. A\r\nnumber of these traps in various places, and especially in the vicinity\r\nof the orchard, have kept Mr. Walmsley's farm comparatively free of\r\nrabbits. Rabbits occupy these tile traps, go in or out at will, and may\r\nbe captured when desired. Whenever Mr. Walmsley visits his traps he is\r\naccompanied by a trained dog that locates the trapped animals. The cover\r\nis lifted from the upright tile and the rabbit captured by hand; if it\r\nbolts from the side opening it is caught by the dog. A short pole fitted\r\nwith a 5-inch wooden disk may be inserted in the side opening to prevent\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--A Walmsley tile trap in use.]\r\n\r\nThese traps are especially suitable for open lands and prairies, where\r\nrabbits can not find many natural hiding places. Built on waste land,\r\nthey may become a permanent part of the farm equipment and will cost\r\nnothing for repairs from year to year. Their first cost may be greatly\r\nreduced by use of second-grade or even broken tiles. If one wishes to\r\npoison rabbits, the baits may be placed inside these traps and domestic\r\nanimals or birds will not be endangered. The Walmsley trap also\r\nfurnishes an excellent means of obtaining rabbits for the table or even\r\nfor market without damaging them by shooting.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONING.\r\n\r\nPoison for killing rabbits has been used in the West with considerable\r\nsuccess. Only in exceptional cases, however, is its use advisable in\r\nStates that protect rabbits. The most favorable season for using poison\r\nis in winter or after a long drought in summer has made green food\r\nscarce. In some localities summer poisoning is interfered with by\r\ncrickets or grasshoppers consuming the bait.\r\n\r\nThe following method is adapted for general use: Insert crystals of\r\nstrychnine or powdered strychnine in pieces of apple or melon rind and\r\nplace these baits at intervals along rabbit runs or paths. ~Take care to\r\nput the poisoned baits where children and domestic animals can not get\r\nthem.~ Where no well-defined runs are visible in orchards, artificial\r\nones may be made with a narrow drag or scraper. Along such runs or the\r\ndead furrows of plowed fields rabbits habitually travel. Baits may be\r\nplaced on the ground or elevated on short sticks along the path, and\r\nshould be looked after with care. ~Any baits left after poisoning\r\noperations are finished should be destroyed.~\r\n\r\nFor poisoning rabbits in winter or during droughts the following formula\r\nis recommended: Good oats, 12 quarts; powdered strychnine, 1 ounce;\r\nlaundry starch, 1 tablespoonful; soda (bicarbonate), 1 ounce;\r\nsaccharine, 1/8 ounce; water, 1 quart. Mix the starch with 1/2 pint of\r\ncold water. Pour this into 1-1/2 pints of boiling water and continue the\r\nboiling for a minute or two until the starch is clear. Mix the dry\r\nstrychnine and soda in a small pan and sift it over the hot starch,\r\nstirring thoroughly to form a smooth paste. Add the saccharine and stir\r\nagain. Pour the mixture over the oats in a metal tub, mixing until all\r\nthe grain is wet. Allow the oats to dry before distributing. Not over a\r\ntablespoonful of the grain should be put in a single bait and this\r\nshould be scattered considerably. A little alfalfa hay will help attract\r\nrabbits to the poisoned grain. This poison is recommended for use when\r\nsnow covers the ground. It is effective against both cottontails and\r\nlarge rabbits.\r\n\r\nPartly ripened heads of barley or wheat soaked in a solution of\r\nstrychnine and saccharine or coated with the starch-strychnine solution\r\njust described have also proved effective baits for rabbits, but ~great\r\ncare must be exercised~ in using them, as ~they are likely to be eaten by\r\nlive stock~.\r\n\r\nCottontail rabbits may be poisoned in winter by baiting them with twigs\r\ncut from apple trees and dipped in or thinly coated with the\r\nstarch-strychnine poison. These twigs are scattered along rabbit trails\r\nand are effective against both meadow mice and rabbits. They are less\r\ndangerous to domestic animals than grain baits.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTERIAL DISEASES.\r\n\r\nThe fact that when rabbits become excessively abundant in any locality\r\nepizootic diseases often destroy them in large numbers has led many\r\npeople to expect that a micro-organism would be found which would afford\r\na ready means of rabbit control. The Biological Survey receives many\r\napplications for such bacterial preparations. In reply to all of them it\r\nhas been necessary to state that thus far all attempts to spread\r\ncontagious disease artificially among wild rabbits have failed to give\r\npractical results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION OF CROPS FROM RABBITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nComplete extermination of rabbits in any part of the United States is\r\nnot desirable, even if possible. They should be reduced in numbers only\r\nsufficiently to secure comparative safety to crops, and before active\r\nwholesale destruction of the animals is attempted the possibility of\r\ncrop protection by other means should be carefully considered. In many\r\ncases one of these means would probably be the more economical method.\r\n\r\n\r\nRABBIT-PROOF FENCES.\r\n\r\nWhen rabbits are abundant and the area to be protected is not too great,\r\na rabbit-proof fence may profitably be used. Woven-wire netting is\r\nrecommended for this purpose. This material is in general use, not only\r\nagainst the rabbit pests of Australia and Europe, but in our own country\r\nagainst both large and small rabbits. As our species burrow less than\r\nthe European rabbit the requirements for rabbit proofing a fence here\r\nare not so great. Even the cottontails, when driven by hunger, will dig\r\nunder a fence, but this may be prevented either by use of wire with\r\nclose barbs in contact with the ground or by plowing a furrow against\r\nthe lower edge. A netting of galvanized wire with 1-1/2-inch mesh and\r\n2-1/2 to 3 feet high is a sufficient barrier against cottontails. Where\r\nsnow is infrequent market gardeners and nurserymen use a 2-foot fence,\r\nbut in the North they prefer to use a netting 3-1/2 feet wide, and to\r\nturn from 4 to 6 inches of the lower edge flat and cover it with soil.\r\nNetting made of No. 20 wire costs from 25 to 35 cents a rod. Heavier\r\nnetting slightly increases the cost, but adds to the durability of the\r\nfence. Where lumber is cheap, a picket fence or one made of laths and\r\nwire is practicable. When deep snows fall and drifts form, fences offer\r\nno protection to crops against rabbits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREE PROTECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHES.\r\n\r\nMany devices for protecting trees from rabbits have been recommended,\r\nthe majority of which are paints, smears, or washes supposed to be\r\ndistasteful to the animals. Many are not sufficiently permanent to\r\nafford protection for an entire winter, and most of those that are\r\nlasting are injurious to trees. Coal tar, pine tar, tarred paper, and\r\noils, under certain conditions, are dangerous to young trees. Carbolic\r\nacid and other volatile substances afford only temporary protection, and\r\nmust be renewed too often to warrant their use. Bitter substances, like\r\ncommercial aloes and quassia, are useless against rabbits.\r\n\r\nThe most promising simple washes for protecting large trees from rabbits\r\nare those containing lime mixed with sulphur or copperas in various\r\ncombinations. Lime alone is not sufficiently permanent, especially where\r\nmuch rain falls. When mixed with sufficient copperas it has a deep green\r\ncolor and sticks much better. The lime-sulphur wash commonly used to\r\ndestroy San Jose scale in winter has often proved successful as a rabbit\r\nrepellent, but its lack of adhesive qualities often makes it fail. The\r\ndefects may be partly corrected by mixing salt, soap, or a cheap glue\r\nwith the lime and sulphur while the wash is still hot.\r\n\r\nA poisoned wash of starch and glycerin, tried during the winter of\r\n1913-14 in Idaho by a field agent of the Biological Survey, gave\r\nexcellent results in protecting young orchards from jack rabbits, and\r\nwould probably be equally effective where cottontails are concerned. The\r\nwash is prepared as follows:\r\n\r\nDissolve 1 ounce of strychnine (sulphate) in 3 quarts of boiling water.\r\nDissolve 1/2 pound of laundry starch in 1 pint of cold water. Pour the\r\nstarch into the vessel containing the strychnine and boil the mixture a\r\nshort time until it is clear, adding 6 ounces of glycerin and stirring\r\nthoroughly. When it is cool enough apply with a paint brush to the tree\r\ntrunks.\r\n\r\nThe glycerin and starch adhere well and form a thin coating to the bark.\r\nRabbits attacking the trees will be quickly killed. In the Idaho\r\nexperiments none of the trees were damaged badly enough to affect their\r\ngrowth and all the rabbits in the orchards were destroyed. The method is\r\nwell worth trying; but ~care should be taken not to endanger domestic\r\nanimals~.\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL CONTRIVANCES.\r\n\r\nAmong the best mechanical contrivances for protecting trees from rabbits\r\nare cylinders of woven wire netting. Poultry netting of 1-inch mesh,\r\nmade of No. 20 galvanized wire, will answer every requirement. Rolls 18\r\ninches wide are used for cottontails, and the material is cut into\r\n1-foot lengths. One of the sections is rolled into cylindrical shape\r\nabout the trunk of each tree and fastened at several places by bending\r\nand twisting the projecting ends of wire. No other fastening is needed,\r\nbut stakes or spreaders may be used to prevent rabbits from pressing the\r\nwire against the bark and doing injury through the meshes. These guards\r\nshould be left on the trunks, and will last as long as the trees require\r\nprotection. The cost of material is less than 2 cents for each tree.\r\nThese protectors may vary in size to suit the requirements of any\r\nparticular locality or kind of tree. They may be adapted to protection\r\nfrom the larger rabbits by using wider rolls and to protection from both\r\nmeadow mice and rabbits by using wire of finer mesh and by pressing the\r\nlower edges into the ground.\r\n\r\nVeneer and other forms of wooden protectors are popular, and have\r\nseveral advantages when used for cottontail rabbits. When left\r\npermanently upon the trees, however, they furnish retreats for insect\r\npests. For this reason they should be removed each spring. While the\r\nlabor of removing and replacing them is considerable, they have the\r\nadvantage when pressed well into the soil of protecting from both mice\r\nand rabbits. They cost from 60 cents a hundred upward, and are much\r\nsuperior to building paper or newspaper wrappings. The writer has known\r\ninstances where rabbits tore wrappings of building paper from apple\r\ntrees and in a single night injured hundreds. \"Gunny-sack\" and other\r\ncloth wrappings well tied on are effective protectors. Cornstalks\r\nfurnish a cheap material for orchard protection when cut into lengths of\r\n18 to 20 inches, split, and tied with the flat side against the tree, so\r\nas fully to cover the trunk. However, they last but one season and\r\nputting them in place involves much labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER MEANS.\r\n\r\nFew of these methods for the protection of individual trees in orchards\r\nor elsewhere are applicable to young woodlands or forest plantations\r\nwhere trees grow close together. In these cases the only remedy is the\r\ndestruction of the animals or their exclusion by wire nettings.\r\n\r\nClean cultivation, generally, possesses advantages in preventing rabbit\r\ndepredations, since it reduces the number of places of refuge for the\r\nanimals; but rabbits go long distances in search of food, especially in\r\nwinter, and clean cultivation can not be applied on the western plains,\r\nwhere dense windbreaks are essential to successful orcharding.\r\n\r\nFeeding rabbits in winter to prevent their attacks on orchards has been\r\npracticed successfully, on the theory that it is cheaper to feed than to\r\nfight them. One plan is to leave the winter prunings of apple trees\r\nscattered about the orchard. Another is to furnish corn, cabbage, or\r\nturnips in sufficient quantity to provide food for the rabbits during\r\ncold weather. These methods have considerable merit, particularly the\r\nfirst, which seems to give satisfactory results when both mice and\r\nrabbits are present.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON: GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE: 1916",
