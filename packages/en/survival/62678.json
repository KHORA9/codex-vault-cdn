The esthetic value of birds is\r\ngreat--greater, indeed, than that of any other group of animals; and that\r\nthis is a real and especially treasured value is not to be denied. But it\r\nis in their relation to insect and other enemies of crops that birds are\r\nmost directly associated with the welfare of mankind, and their value in\r\nthis particular should be made as widely known as possible.\r\n\r\nThis bulletin is one of a series designed to assist in doing this. Not\r\nall birds are beneficial, and all facts tending to show in which class\r\neach species belongs will be set forth. The useful kinds far outnumber\r\nthe injurious, however, and so great is their value as insect destroyers\r\nin the United States that to them may be given the credit of being one of\r\nthe greatest controlling factors in limiting the development of insect\r\npests and in preventing many disastrous outbreaks.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages are discussed the habitat, food habits, and\r\nrelation to agriculture of more than 50 species of birds common to\r\nfarming sections.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, D.

In the case of species which are very abundant, or which\r\nfeed to some extent on the crops of the farmer, the question of their\r\naverage diet becomes one of supreme importance, and only by stomach\r\nexaminations can it be satisfactorily answered. Field observations are\r\nat best but fragmentary and inconclusive and lead to no final results.\r\nBirds are often accused of eating this or that product of cultivation,\r\nwhen an examination of the stomachs shows the accusation to be unfounded.\r\nAccordingly, the Biological Survey has conducted for some years a\r\nsystematic investigation of the food of those species which are most\r\ncommon about the farm and garden.\r\n\r\nWithin certain limits birds eat the kind of food that is most accessible,\r\nespecially when their natural food is scarce or wanting. Thus they\r\nsometimes injure the crops of the farmer who has unintentionally\r\ndestroyed their natural food in his improvement of swamp or pasture.\r\nMost of the damage done by birds and complained of by farmers and\r\nfruit growers arises from this very cause, the berry-producing shrubs\r\nand seed-bearing weeds have been cleared away, and the birds have no\r\nrecourse but to attack the cultivated grain or fruit which has replaced\r\ntheir natural food supply. The great majority of land birds subsist upon\r\ninsects during the period of nesting and molting, and also feed their\r\nyoung upon them during the first few weeks. Many species live almost\r\nentirely upon insects, taking vegetable food only when other subsistence\r\nfails. It is thus evident that in the course of a year birds destroy an\r\nincalculable number of insects, and it is difficult to overestimate the\r\nvalue of their services in restraining the great tide of insect life.\r\n\r\nIn winter, in the northern part of the country, insects become scarce or\r\nentirely disappear. Many species of birds, however, remain during the\r\ncold season and are able to maintain life by eating vegetable food, as\r\nthe seeds of weeds. Here again is another useful function of birds in\r\ndestroying these weed seeds and thereby lessening the growth of the next\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages are discussed the food habits of more than\r\n50 birds belonging to 12 families. Many are eastern forms which are\r\nrepresented in the West by slightly different species or subspecies, but\r\nunless the food habits differ they are not separately described. In some\r\ncases specific percentages of food are given, but for the most part the\r\nstatements are made without direct reference to the data on which they\r\nare based.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLUEBIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eastern bluebird[2] (fig. 1), one of the most familiar and welcome\r\nof our feathered visitors, is a common inhabitant of all the States east\r\nof the Rocky Mountains from the Gulf of Mexico to southern Canada. In\r\nthe Mississippi valley it winters as far north as southern Illinois, and\r\nin the East as far as Pennsylvania. It is one of the earliest northern\r\nmigrants, and everywhere is hailed as a harbinger of spring. Very\r\ndomestic in habits, it frequents orchards and gardens, and builds its\r\nnests in cavities of trees, crannies in farm buildings, or boxes provided\r\nfor its use.\r\n\r\n[2] _Sialia sialis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Bluebird. Length, about 6½ inches.]\r\n\r\nThe bluebird has not been accused, so far as known, of stealing fruit or\r\nof preying upon crops. An examination of 855 stomachs showed that 68 per\r\ncent of the food consists of insects and their allies, while the other\r\n32 per cent is made up of various vegetable substances, found mostly in\r\nstomachs taken in winter. Beetles constitute 21 per cent of the whole\r\nfood, grasshoppers 22, caterpillars 10, and various other insects 9,\r\nwhile a number of spiders and myriapods, about 6 per cent, comprise\r\nthe remainder of the animal diet. All these are more or less harmful,\r\nexcept a few predacious beetles, which amount to 9 per cent. In view\r\nof the large consumption of grasshoppers and caterpillars, we may at\r\nleast condone this offense, if such it may be called. The destruction\r\nof grasshoppers is very noticeable in August and September, when these\r\ninsects make up about 53 per cent of the diet.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in the selection of its food the bluebird is governed\r\nmore by abundance than by choice. Predacious beetles are eaten in spring,\r\nas they are among the first insects to appear; but in early summer\r\ncaterpillars form an important part of the diet, and these are later\r\nreplaced by grasshoppers. Beetles are eaten at all times, except when\r\ngrasshoppers are more easily obtained.\r\n\r\nSo far as its vegetable food is concerned the bluebird is positively\r\nharmless. The only trace of any useful product in the stomachs consisted\r\nof a few blackberry seeds, and even these probably belonged to wild\r\nrather than cultivated varieties. Following is a list of the various\r\nseeds which were found; Blackberry, chokeberry, juniperberry, pokeberry,\r\npartridgeberry, greenbrier, Virginia creeper, bittersweet, holly,\r\nstrawberry bush, false spikenard, wild sarsaparilla, sumac (several\r\nspecies), rose haws, sorrel, ragweed, grass, and asparagus. This list\r\nshows how little the bluebird depends upon the farm or garden to supply\r\nits needs and how easily, by encouraging the growth of some of these\r\nplants, many of which are highly ornamental, the bird may be induced to\r\nmake its home on the premises.\r\n\r\nTwo species of bluebirds inhabit the Western States--the mountain\r\nbluebird[3] and the western bluebird.[4] In their food habits they are\r\neven more to be commended than their eastern relative. Their insect food\r\nis obtainable at all times of the year, and the general diet varies only\r\nin the fall, when some fruit, principally elderberries, is eaten, though\r\nan occasional blackberry or grape is also relished. In an examination of\r\n217 stomachs of the western bluebird, animal matter (insects and spiders)\r\nwas found to the extent of 82 per cent and vegetable matter to the extent\r\nof 18 per cent. The bulk of the former consists of bugs, grasshoppers,\r\nand caterpillars. Grasshoppers, when they can be obtained, are eaten\r\nfreely during the whole season. Caterpillars also are a favorite food\r\nand are eaten during every month of the year; March is the month of\r\ngreatest consumption, with 50 per cent, and the average for the year is\r\n20 per cent. Two stomachs taken in January contained 64 and 50 per cent,\r\nrespectively, of caterpillars. Beetles also are eaten and comprise mostly\r\nharmful species.\r\n\r\n[3] _Sialia currucoides_.\r\n\r\n[4] _Sialia mexicana_ subspecies.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable matter consists of weed seeds and small fruits. In December\r\na few grapes are eaten, but elderberries are the favorites whenever they\r\ncan be found. It is only when these are in their greatest abundance that\r\nvegetable exceeds animal food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROBINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Robin. Length, about 10 inches.]\r\n\r\nThe robin[5] (fig. 2), in many parts of the country one of the most\r\ncherished of our birds, is found throughout the States east of the Great\r\nPlains, and is represented farther west and south by slightly different\r\nsubspecies.[6], [7] It breeds far north through Canada, and is found even\r\nin Alaska. Although the great bulk of the species leaves the Northern\r\nStates in winter, a few individuals remain in sheltered swamps, where\r\nwild berries furnish abundant food. The robin is an omnivorous feeder\r\nand its food habits have sometimes caused apprehension to the fruit\r\ngrower, for it is fond of cherries and other small fruits, particularly\r\nthe earlier varieties. For this reason many complaints have been lodged\r\nagainst robins, and it has been necessary to permit the killing of the\r\nbirds in some fruit-growing regions.\r\n\r\n[5] _Planesticus migratorius_.\r\n\r\n[6] _Planesticus migratorius propinquus_.\r\n\r\n[7] _Planesticus migratorius achrusterus_.\r\n\r\nExaminations of 1,236 stomachs show that 42 per cent of its food is\r\nanimal matter, principally insects, while the remainder is made up\r\nlargely of small fruits or berries. Over 16 per cent consists of beetles,\r\nabout one-third of which are useful ground beetles, taken mostly in\r\nspring and fall when other insects are scarce. Grasshoppers make up about\r\n5 per cent of the whole food, but in August they comprise 17 per cent.\r\nCaterpillars form about 9 per cent, while the rest of the animal food,\r\nabout 11 per cent, is made up of various insects, with a few spiders,\r\nsnails, and angleworms. All the grasshoppers, caterpillars, and bugs,\r\nwith a large portion of the beetles, are injurious, and it is safe to say\r\nthat noxious insects comprise more than one-third of the robin's food.\r\n\r\nVegetable food forms 58 per cent of the stomach contents, over 42 per\r\ncent being wild fruits and only a little more than 8 per cent being\r\npossibly cultivated varieties. Cultivated fruit amounting to about 25 per\r\ncent was found in the stomachs in June and July, but only a trifle in\r\nAugust. Wild fruit, on the contrary, is eaten every month and constitutes\r\na staple food during half the year. No less than 65 species of fruit were\r\nidentified in the stomachs; of these, the most important were 4 species\r\nof dogwood, 3 of wild cherries, 3 of wild grapes, 4 of greenbrier, 2\r\nof holly, 2 of elder; and cranberries, huckleberries, blueberries,\r\nbarberries, service berries, hackberries, and persimmons; together with 4\r\nspecies of sumac and various other seeds not strictly fruit.\r\n\r\nThe depredations of the robin seem to be confined to the smaller and\r\nearlier fruits, few, if any, complaints being made that it eats apples,\r\npeaches, pears, grapes, or even late cherries. By the time these are\r\nripe the forests and hedges are teeming with wild fruits which the bird\r\nevidently finds more to its taste. The cherry, unfortunately for man,\r\nripens so early that it is almost the only fruit accessible at a time\r\nwhen the bird's appetite has been sharpened by a long-continued diet of\r\ninsects, earthworms, and dried berries, and it is no wonder that at first\r\nthe rich juicy morsels are greedily eaten.\r\n\r\nWhile the robin takes some cultivated fruits, it must be remembered that,\r\nbeing a natural enemy of the insect world, it has been working during the\r\nwhole season to make that crop a possibility, and when the fruit ripens\r\nthe robin already has a standing account with the farmer for services\r\nrendered, with the credits up to this time entirely on his side.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written about the delicate discrimination of birds for\r\nchoice fruit and their selection of only the finest and costliest\r\nvarieties. This is contrary to observed facts. Birds, unlike human\r\nbeings, seem to prefer fruit that, like the mulberry, is sweetly insipid,\r\nor that, like the chokecherry or holly, has some astringent or bitter\r\nquality. The so-called black alder, a species of holly, has bright\r\nscarlet berries tasting as bitter as quinine, that ripen late in October\r\nand remain on the bushes through November. Though frost grapes, the fruit\r\nof the Virginia creeper, and several species of dogwood are abundant at\r\nthe same time, the birds have been found to eat the berries of the holly\r\nto a considerable extent. It is, moreover, a remarkable fact that the\r\nwild fruits upon which birds largely feed are those which man neither\r\ngathers for his own use nor adopts for cultivation.\r\n\r\nWhere wild fruit is not abundant, a few fruit-bearing shrubs and vines\r\njudiciously planted will serve for ornament and provide food for the\r\nbirds. The Russian mulberry is a vigorous grower and a profuse bearer,\r\nripening at the same time as the cherry. So far as observation has gone,\r\nmost birds seem to prefer its fruit to any other. It is believed that a\r\nnumber of mulberry trees planted around the garden or orchard would fully\r\nprotect the more valuable fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TITMICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBirds of the titmouse family, though insignificant in size, are far from\r\nbeing so in the matter of food habits. What they lack in size of body\r\nthey more than make up in numbers of individuals. While in the case of\r\nsome larger birds, as, for instance, the flicker, there is one pair of\r\neyes to look for food for one large stomach, we have in the case of the\r\nten times as numerous titmice an equivalent stomach capacity divided into\r\n10 parts, each furnished with a pair of eyes and other accessories, as\r\nwings and feet. As against the one place occupied by the larger bird, 10\r\nare being searched for food at the same time by the smaller species.\r\n\r\nThe character of the food of titmice gives a peculiar value to their\r\nservices, for it consists largely of the small insects and their eggs\r\nthat wholly escape the search of larger birds. Throughout the year most\r\nof the species of this group remain on their range, so that they are\r\nconstantly engaged in their beneficial work, continuing it in winter when\r\nthe majority of their coworkers have sought a milder clime. It is at\r\nthis season that the titmice do their greatest good, for when flying and\r\ncrawling insects are no more to be found, the birds must feed upon such\r\nspecies as they find hibernating in crevices, or upon the eggs of insects\r\nlaid in similar places. In winter's dearth of moving insects the search\r\nfor such animal food as may be found is perforce thorough and unremitting.\r\n\r\nWithin the boundaries of the United States are some 17 species of\r\ntitmice, with nearly as many races or subspecies, so that there is\r\nno portion of the country lacking one or more forms. The western\r\ncoast region is peculiarly rich In representatives of the family. In\r\nthe eastern portion of the country the best-known and most widely\r\ndistributed species is the common black-capped chickadee[8] (fig. 3).\r\nThis bird, or some of its subspecies, occupies the whole of that part of\r\nthe United States north of the latitude of Washington and extends into\r\nCanada. It is a prolific breeder, usually rearing from six to eight young\r\nin a brood.\r\n\r\n[8] _Penthestes atricapillus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Black-capped chickadee. Length, about 5¼\r\ninches.]\r\n\r\nExamination of 289 stomachs of this chickadee shows that its food\r\nconsists of 68 per cent animal matter (insects) and 32 per cent vegetable\r\nmatter. The former is made up of small caterpillars and moths and their\r\neggs. Prominent among the latter are the eggs of the tent caterpillar\r\nmoths, both the orchard and forest species. As these are two of our most\r\ndestructive insects, the good done by the chickadee in devouring their\r\neggs needs no comment. During the winter the chickadee's food is made\r\nup of larvæ, chrysalids, and eggs of moths, varied by a few seeds, but\r\nas spring brings out hordes of flying, crawling, and jumping insects,\r\nthe bird varies its diet by taking also some of these. Flies and bugs\r\nare the favorites until the weather becomes quite warm, when beetles and\r\nsmall wasps also are enjoyed. Among the bugs may be mentioned the plant\r\nlice and their eggs which are eaten in winter. The beetles nearly all\r\nbelong to the group of snout beetles, more commonly known as weevils.\r\nThese insects are mostly of small size, and nearly all are known to the\r\nfarmer or fruit raiser as pests. Seventeen of them were found in one\r\nstomach. Grasshoppers do not at any time constitute an important element\r\nof the food of the chickadee, as they are too large for so small a bird;\r\nmoreover, they are for the most part terrestrial Insects, while the bird\r\nis essentially arboreal. Small wasps and ants are eaten to some extent\r\nSpiders constitute an Important element of the food and are eaten at all\r\ntimes of the year, the birds locating them when they are hibernating in\r\nwinter, as well as when they are active in summer. The vegetable food of\r\nthe chickadee consists largely of small seeds, except in summer, when\r\nthey are replaced by pulp of wild fruit. The wax from the seeds of poison\r\nivy Is eaten during the winter months, but the seeds themselves are not\r\ntaken. In this respect the chickadee differs from most other birds, which\r\nswallow the seeds whole; these, after digesting the wax, pass the seeds\r\nthrough the alimentary canal, or regurgitate them, and so scatter them\r\nbroadcast to reproduce the noxious plants.\r\n\r\nIn the southern part of the country the Carolina chickadee[9] and the\r\ntufted tit[10] replace the black-cap, but their food habits are so\r\nsimilar that there is practically no difference in the work done. In the\r\nWest several other species occur; one of the most interesting is the\r\nbush tit[11] which, with several subspecies, occupies the whole Pacific\r\ncoast region. They are active, social little creatures, and except for a\r\nshort time during the breeding season are found in flocks, flitting from\r\ntree to tree, busily hunting for Insects and their eggs. The contents\r\nof 66 stomachs of these birds were found to consist mostly of injurious\r\ninsects to the extent of 83 per cent. Of these the most important was a\r\nsmall hemipterous insect which amounted to more than half of the stomach\r\ncontents. These insects are of considerable economic importance, as they\r\nfrequently infest grapevines and other plants to a harmful extent Several\r\nstomachs were almost exclusively filled with these minute creatures, some\r\ncontaining as many as 100 individuals.\r\n\r\n[9] _Penthestes carolinensis_.\r\n\r\n[10] _Bæolophus bicolor_.\r\n\r\n[11] _Psaltriparus minimus_.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important and interesting insect found was the black\r\nolive scale, which occurred in 24 stomachs and amounted to a little more\r\nthan 18 per cent of the food. In addition, a number of the stomachs were\r\nmore or less filled with another scale, which was not further identified.\r\nA number of small snout beetles (weevils) were eaten and some small\r\ncaterpillars; there were also the remains of a spider.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable food of the species seemed to consist mostly of seeds, but\r\nthey were so broken up as to defy recognition. A little fruit pulp and a\r\nlittle mast were also found.\r\n\r\nAmong the stomachs of the bush tits examined were those of one brood\r\nof eight nestlings about 10 days old. The vegetable matter in these\r\nstomachs was only three-fourths of 1 per cent and consisted of one seed\r\nand some rubbish. The animal matter was made up of beetles, wasps, bugs,\r\ncaterpillars and pupæ, and spiders. The greatest interest lies in the\r\nfact that every one of these stomachs contained pupæ of the codling\r\nmoth, on an average of over five to each. The oak tree in which these\r\nbirds were found was in a belt of timber near a neglected orchard which\r\nthe parent birds used as a foraging ground, and they did their best to\r\nremedy the neglect of the owner. As feeding and digestion in the case of\r\nnestling birds is almost continuous during the hours of daylight, the\r\nabove record would be several times repeated during a day's feeding.\r\nThere were probably not less than a dozen nests of the bush tit along\r\nthe border of this orchard, and these birds must have exerted a great\r\nrestrictive influence upon the increase of the codling moth, as well as\r\nof other insects in that vicinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--House wren. Length, about 4¾ inches.]\r\n\r\nThe diminutive house wren[12] (fig. 4) frequents barns and gardens, and\r\nparticularly old orchards in which the trees are partially decayed. He\r\nmakes his nest in a hollow where perhaps a woodpecker had a domicile the\r\nyear before, but he is a pugnacious character, and if he happens to fancy\r\none of the boxes put up for bluebirds, he does not hesitate to take it He\r\nis usually not slow to avail himself of boxes, gourds, tin cans, or empty\r\njars placed for his accommodation.\r\n\r\n[12] _Troglodytes aëdon_.\r\n\r\nIn food habits the house wren is entirely beneficial. He may be said to\r\nlive upon animal food alone, for an examination of 88 stomachs showed\r\nthat 98 per cent of the contents was made up of insects or their allies,\r\nand only 2 per cent was vegetable food, including bits of grass and\r\nsimilar matter, evidently taken by accident with the insects. Half\r\nof this food consisted of grasshoppers and beetles; the remainder of\r\ncaterpillars, bugs, and spiders. As the wren is a prolific breeder,\r\nfrequently rearing in a season from 12 to 16 young, a family of these\r\nbirds must cause considerable reduction in the number of insects in a\r\ngarden. Wrens are industrious foragers, searching every tree, shrub, and\r\nvine for caterpillars, and examining every post and rail of the fence and\r\nevery cranny in the wall for insects or spiders.\r\n\r\nThe house wren is only one of a numerous group of small birds of similar\r\nhabits. There are within the limits of the United States 28 species\r\nand subspecies of wrens, occupying more or less completely the whole\r\ncountry from the Atlantic to the Pacific. With the exception of the marsh\r\nwrens,[13] they all appear to prefer some cosy nook for a nesting site,\r\nand, as it happens, the farm buildings afford just the place desired.\r\nThis has led several of the wrens to seek out the habitations of man,\r\nand he is benefited by their destruction of noxious insects. Wrens have\r\nrarely been accused of harm, and their presence should be encouraged\r\nexcept when undue interference with the nests of other birds is noted.\r\n\r\n[13] _Telmatodytes palustris_ and _Cistotherus stellaris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN THRASHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brown thrasher[14] (fig. 5) breeds throughout the United States\r\neast of the Great Plains, and winters in the South Atlantic and Gulf\r\nStates. It visits the garden or orchard, its nest, however, being in\r\ndense shrubbery or groves. The thrasher's favorite time for singing is\r\nin early morning, when, perched on the top of a bush or tree, it gives\r\nan exhibition of vocal powers which would do credit to the mockingbird.\r\nIndeed, in the South, where the latter bird is abundant, the thrasher is\r\nknown as the sandy mocker.\r\n\r\n[14] _Toxostoma rufum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Brown thrasher. Length, about 11 inches.]\r\n\r\nThe food of the brown thrasher consists of both fruit and insects. An\r\nexamination of 636 stomachs showed 59 per cent of vegetable and 41 per\r\ncent of animal food, practically all insects, and mostly taken in spring\r\nbefore fruit was ripe. Half the insects were beetles and the remainder\r\nchiefly grasshoppers, caterpillars, bugs, and spiders. A few predacious\r\nbeetles were eaten, but on the whole the work of the species as an insect\r\ndestroyer may be considered beneficial.\r\n\r\nEight per cent of its food is made up of fruits like raspberries and\r\ncurrants which are or may be cultivated, but the raspberries at least\r\nare as likely to belong to wild as to cultivated varieties. Grain, made\r\nup mostly of scattered kernels of oats and corn, is merely a trifle,\r\namounting to only 3 per cent. Though some of the corn may be taken from\r\nnewly planted fields, it is amply paid for by the destruction of May\r\nbeetles which are eaten at the same time. The rest of the food consists\r\nof wild fruit or seeds. Taken all in all, the brown thrasher is a useful\r\nbird, and probably does as good work in its secluded retreats as it would\r\nabout the garden, for the swamps and groves are no doubt the breeding\r\ngrounds of many insects that migrate thence to attack the crops of the\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCATBIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Catbird. Length, about 9 inches.]\r\n\r\nThe catbird[15] (fig. 6), like the thrasher, is a lover of thickets and\r\ndelights to make its home in a tangle of wild grapevines, greenbriers,\r\nand shrubs, where it is safe from attack and can find its favorite food\r\nin abundance. It is found throughout the United States west to the Rocky\r\nMountains, and extends also from Washington, Idaho, and Utah northward\r\ninto the Provinces of Canada. It winters in the Southern States, Cuba,\r\nMexico, and Central America.\r\n\r\n[15] _Dumetella carolinensis_.\r\n\r\nReports from the Mississippi Valley indicate that the catbird is\r\nsometimes a serious annoyance to fruit growers. The reason for such\r\nreports may possibly be found in the fact that on the prairies\r\nfruit-bearing shrubs, which afford so large a part of this bird's food,\r\nare conspicuously absent With the settlement of this region comes an\r\nextensive planting of orchards, vineyards, and small-fruit gardens, which\r\nfurnish shelter and nesting sites for the catbird as well as for other\r\nspecies. There is in consequence a large increase in the numbers of the\r\nbirds, but no corresponding gain in the supply of native fruits upon\r\nwhich they were accustomed to feed. Under these circumstances what is\r\nmore natural than for the birds to turn to cultivated fruit for their\r\nfood. The remedy is obvious: Cultivated fruits can be protected by the\r\nsimple expedient of planting the wild species which are preferred by the\r\nbirds. Some experiments with catbirds in captivity show that the Russian\r\nmulberry is preferred to any cultivated fruit.\r\n\r\nThe stomachs of 645 catbirds were examined and found to contain 44 per\r\ncent of animal (insect) and 56 per cent of vegetable food. Ants, beetles,\r\ncaterpillars, and grasshoppers constitute three-fourths of the animal\r\nfood, the remainder being made up of bugs, miscellaneous insects, and\r\nspiders. One-third of the vegetable food consists of cultivated fruits,\r\nor those which may be cultivated, as strawberries, raspberries, and\r\nblackberries; but while we debit the bird with the whole of this, it is\r\nprobable--and in the eastern and well-wooded part of the country almost\r\ncertain--that a large part is obtained from wild vines. The rest of the\r\nvegetable matter is mostly wild fruit, as cherries, dogwood, sour gum,\r\nelderberries, greenbrier, spiceberries, black alder, sumac, and poison\r\nivy. Although the catbird sometimes does considerable harm by destroying\r\nsmall fruit, it can not on the whole be considered injurious. On the\r\ncontrary, in most parts of the country it does far more good than harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWALLOWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven common species of swallows are found within the limits of the\r\nUnited States, four of which have abandoned to some extent their\r\nprimitive nesting habits and have attached themselves to the abodes of\r\nman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Barn swallow. Length, about 7 inches.]\r\n\r\nIn the eastern part of the country the barn swallow[16] (fig. 7) now\r\nbuilds exclusively under roofs, having entirely abandoned the rock\r\ncaves and cliffs in which it formerly nested. More recently the cliff\r\nswallow[17] has found a better nesting site under the eaves of buildings\r\nthan was afforded by the overhanging cliffs of earth or stone which it\r\nonce used and to which it still resorts occasionally in the East and\r\nhabitually in the unsettled West. The martin[18] and the white-bellied,\r\nor tree, swallow[19] nest either in houses supplied for the purpose, in\r\nabandoned nests of woodpeckers, or in natural crannies in rocks. The\r\nnorthern violet-green swallow,[20] the rough-winged swallow,[21] and the\r\nbank swallow[22] still live in practically such places as their ancestors\r\nchose.\r\n\r\n[16] _Hirundo erythrogastra_.\r\n\r\n[17] _Petrochelidon lunifrons_.\r\n\r\n[18] _Progne subis_.\r\n\r\n[19] _Iridoprocne bicolor_.\r\n\r\n[20] _Tachycineta thalassina_.\r\n\r\n[21] _Stelgidopteryx serripennis_.\r\n\r\n[22] _Riparia riparia_.\r\n\r\nField observation convinces an ordinarily attentive person that the food\r\nof swallows must consist of the smaller insects captured in mid-air or\r\npicked from the tops of tall grass or weeds. This observation is borne\r\nout by an examination of stomachs, which shows that the food is made up\r\nof many small species of beetles which are much on the wing; many species\r\nof flies, together with large quantities of flying ants; and a few\r\ninsects of similar kinds. Most of these are either injurious or annoying,\r\nand the numbers destroyed by swallows are not only beyond calculation but\r\nalmost beyond imagination.\r\n\r\nUnlike many other groups of birds, the six species of swallows found in\r\nthe Eastern States extend in a practically unchanged form across the\r\ncontinent, where they are reinforced by the northern, or Pacific-coast,\r\nviolet-green swallow.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to tear down from the eaves of a barn the nests of a\r\ncolony of cliff swallows, for so far from disfiguring a building they\r\nmake a picturesque addition to it, and the presence of swallows should\r\nbe encouraged by every device. It is said that cliff and barn swallows\r\nmay be induced to build their nests in a particular locality, otherwise\r\nsuitable, by providing a quantity of mud to be used by them as mortar.\r\nBarn swallows may also be encouraged by cutting a small hole in the gable\r\nof the barn, while martins and white-bellied swallows will be grateful\r\nfor boxes like those for the bluebird, but placed in a higher situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWHEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Towhee. Length, about 8 inches.]\r\n\r\nThe towhee, chewink, or ground robin[23] (fig. 8), as it is variously\r\nknown, inhabits nearly the whole of the United States east of the Great\r\nPlains. It breeds from the Middle States northward and winters in the\r\nsouthern half of the country. Naturally associated with the catbird and\r\nbrown thrasher, it lives in much the same places, though it is more given\r\nto haunting hedgerows along roads and fences. After snow has disappeared\r\nin early spring an investigation of the rustling so often heard among the\r\nleaves near a fence or in a thicket will frequently disclose a towhee\r\nhard at work scratching for his dinner after the manner of a hen; and\r\nin these places and along the sunny border of woods old leaves will\r\nbe found overturned where the bird has been searching for hibernating\r\nbeetles and larvæ. The good which the towhee does in this way can hardly\r\nbe overestimated, since the death of a single insect at this time,\r\nbefore it has had an opportunity to deposit its eggs, is equivalent to\r\nthe destruction of a host later in the year. The towhee has also been\r\ncredited with visiting potato fields and feeding upon the potato beetle.\r\nIts vegetable food consists of seeds and small wild fruits, but no\r\ncomplaint on this score is known to have been made. So for as observation\r\ngoes, the bird never touches either cultivated fruit or grain; in fact,\r\nit is too shy and retiring even to stay about gardens for any length of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[23] _Pipilo erythrophthalmus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPARROWS.[24]\r\n\r\n[24] The sparrows here mentioned are all native species. A full account\r\nof the English, or house, sparrow (_Passer domesticus_), including its\r\nintroduction, habits, and depredations, was published In Bull. No. 1\r\nof the Division of Ornithology in 1889. For information in regard to\r\ncombating the English sparrow, see U. S. Department of Agriculture\r\nLeaflet 61, English Sparrow Control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSparrows are not obtrusive birds, either in plumage, song, or action.\r\nThere are some 40 species, with nearly as many subspecies, in North\r\nAmerica. Not more than half a dozen forms are generally known in any one\r\nlocality. All the species are more or less migratory, but so widely are\r\nthey distributed that there is probably no part of the country where some\r\ncan not be found throughout the year.\r\n\r\nWhile sparrows are noted seed eaters, they do not by any means confine\r\nthemselves to a vegetable diet. During the summer, and especially in\r\nthe breeding season, they eat many insects and feed their young largely\r\nupon the same food. Examination of stomachs of three species--the song\r\nsparrow[25] (fig. 9), chipping sparrow,[26] and field sparrow[27]\r\n(fig. 10)--shows that about one-third of the food consists of insects,\r\ncomprising many injurious beetles, as snout beetles or weevils, and\r\nleaf beetles. Many grasshoppers are eaten. In the case of the chipping\r\nsparrow these insects form one-eighth of the food. Grasshoppers would\r\nseem to be rather large morsels, but the bird probably confines itself to\r\nthe smaller species; indeed, the greatest amount (over 36 per cent) is\r\neaten in June, when the larger species are still young and the smaller\r\nmost numerous. Besides the insects already mentioned, many wasps and\r\nbugs are taken. Predacious and parasitic hymenopterous insects and\r\npredacious beetles, all useful, are eaten only to a slight extent, so\r\nthat as a whole the insect diet of the native sparrows may be considered\r\nbeneficial. There are several records of potato-bug larvæ eaten by\r\nchipping sparrows.\r\n\r\n[25] _Melospiza melodia_.\r\n\r\n[26] _Spizella passerina_.\r\n\r\n[27] _Spizella pusilla_.\r\n\r\nTheir vegetable food is limited almost exclusively to hard seeds. This\r\nmight seem to indicate that the birds feed to some extent upon grain, but\r\nthe stomachs examined show only one kind, oats, and but little of that.\r\nThe great bulk of the food is made up of grass and weed seeds, which form\r\nalmost the entire diet during winter, and the amount consumed is immense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Song sparrow. Length, about 6½ inches.]\r\n\r\nIn the agricultural region of the upper Mississippi Valley, by roadsides,\r\non borders of cultivated fields, or in abandoned fields, wherever they\r\ncan obtain a foothold, masses of rank weeds spring up and often form\r\nalmost impenetrable thickets which afford food and shelter for immense\r\nnumbers of birds and enable them to withstand great cold and the most\r\nterrible blizzards. A person visiting one of these weed patches on a\r\nsunny morning in January, when the thermometer is 20° or more below\r\nzero, will be struck with the life and animation of the busy little\r\ninhabitants. Instead of sitting forlorn and half frozen, they may be\r\nseen flitting from branch to branch, twittering and fluttering, and\r\nshowing every evidence of enjoyment and perfect comfort. If one of them\r\nis captured it will be found in excellent condition; in fact, a veritable\r\nball of fat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Field sparrow. Length, about 5½ inches.]\r\n\r\nThe snowbird[28] and tree sparrow[29] are perhaps the most numerous of\r\nall the sparrows. Examination of many stomachs shows that in winter the\r\ntree sparrow feeds entirely upon seeds of weeds. Probably each bird\r\nconsumes about one-fourth of an ounce a day. In an article contributed in\r\n1881 to the New York Tribune the writer estimated the amount of weed seed\r\nannually destroyed by these birds in Iowa. On the basis of one-fourth\r\nof an ounce of seed eaten daily by each bird, and an average of 10 birds\r\nto each square mile, remaining in their winter range 200 days, there\r\nwould be a total of 1,750,000 pounds, or 875 tons of weed seed consumed\r\nin a single season by this one species. Large as are these figures, they\r\nunquestionably fall far short of the reality. The estimate of 10 birds\r\nto a square mile is very conservative, for in Massachusetts, where the\r\nfood supply is less than in the Western States, the tree sparrow is even\r\nmore abundant than this in winter. The writer has known places in Iowa\r\nwhere several thousand tree sparrows could be seen within the space of a\r\nfew acres. This estimate, moreover, is for a single species, while, as a\r\nmatter of fact, there are at least half a dozen birds (not all sparrows)\r\nthat habitually feed during winter on these seeds. Farther south the\r\ntree sparrow is replaced in winter by the white-throated sparrow,[30]\r\nthe white-crowned sparrow,[31] the fox sparrow,[32] the song sparrow,\r\nthe field sparrow, and several others; so that all over the land a vast\r\nnumber of these seed eaters are at work during the colder months reducing\r\nnext year's crop of worse than useless plants.\r\n\r\n[28] _Junco hyemalis_.\r\n\r\n[29] _Spizella monticola_.\r\n\r\n[30] _Zonotrichia albicollis_.\r\n\r\n[31] _Zonotrichia leucophrys_.\r\n\r\n[32] _Passerella iliaca_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSE FINCH\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the sparrow groups, there is probably no member, unless it be\r\nthe exotic form known as the English sparrow,[33] that has by reason\r\nof Its food habits called down so many maledictions upon Its head as\r\nthe house finch,[34] red head, or linnet, as it is variously called.\r\nThis bird, like the other members of its family, is by nature a seed\r\neater, and before the beginning of fruit raising in California probably\r\nsubsisted upon the seeds of weeds, with an occasional taste of some wild\r\nberry. Now, however, when orchards have extended throughout the length\r\nand breadth of the State and every month from May to December sees\r\nsome ripening fruit, the linnets take their share. As their number Is\r\nlegion, the sum total of the fruit that they destroy is more than the\r\nfruit raiser can well spare. As the bird has a stout beak, it has no\r\ndifficulty in breaking the skin of the hardest fruit and feasting upon\r\nthe pulp, thereby spoiling the fruit and giving weaker-billed birds a\r\nchance to sample and acquire a taste for what they might not otherwise\r\nhave molested. Complaints against this bird have been many and loud, more\r\nespecially in the years when fruit crops first came to be an important\r\nfactor in the prosperity of the Pacific coast. At that time the various\r\nfruits afforded the linnets a new and easily obtained food, while\r\ncultivation had reduced their formerly abundant supply of weed seed.\r\nWhen the early fruit growers saw their expected golden harvest suddenly\r\nsnatched away or at least much reduced in value by the little marauders,\r\nit is no wonder that they were exasperated and wished to destroy the\r\nauthors of the mischief.\r\n\r\n[33] _Passer domesticus_.\r\n\r\n[34] _Carpodacus mexicanus frontalis_.\r\n\r\nIn order to test the matter thoroughly and ascertain whether these birds\r\nate any other kind of food that might to some extent offset the damage\r\ninflicted upon the fruit, the horticulturists and ornithologists of\r\nCalifornia were requested to secure a number of the stomachs of these\r\nbirds and send them to the Biological Survey. An agent was also sent to\r\nthe fruit-raising sections, who watched the birds in the orchards and\r\ncollected a number of them. In this way 1,206 stomachs were obtained\r\nand carefully examined, and the result shows that animal food (insects)\r\nconstituted 2.44 per cent and vegetable food 97.56 per cent of the\r\nstomach contents, not counting gravel.\r\n\r\nSo small a proportion of animal food can not, of course, mean a great\r\ndestruction of insects. As these stomachs were collected in every month,\r\nwith the greater number taken during the summer, it is evident that\r\nwhatever good one may expect from the linnet must not be looked for\r\nin this direction. Unlike most of the sparrow family, the linnet does\r\nnot feed its young upon Insects to any great extent. The contents of\r\nthe stomachs of a number of nestlings were carefully examined, and the\r\nonly animal food was found to consist of wooly plant lice. These also\r\nconstituted the great bulk of the animal food eaten by adults.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable food of the species consists of three principal\r\nitems--grain, fruit, and weed seeds. Grain amounts to less than 1½\r\nper cent in August, which is the month of greatest consumption, and the\r\naverage for the year is a trifle more than one-fourth of 1 per cent.\r\nFruit attains its maximum in September, when it amounts to 27 per cent\r\nof the whole food, but the average for the year is only 10 per cent. The\r\nseeds of weeds constitute the bulk of the diet of the linnet, and in\r\nAugust, the month of least consumption, amount to about 64 per cent of\r\nthe food. The average for the year is 86 per cent.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it is evident that whatever the linnet's sins may\r\nbe, grain eating is not one of them. In view of the great complaint\r\nmade against its fruit-eating habits, the small quantity found in the\r\nstomachs taken is somewhat of a surprise. But it must be remembered that\r\nthe stomach contents do not tell the whole story. When a bird takes a\r\nsingle peck from a cherry or an apricot, it spoils the whole fruit, and\r\nin this way may ruin half a dozen in taking a single meal. It is safe to\r\nsay that the fruit pulp found In the stomach does not represent more than\r\none-fifth of what is actually destroyed. That the linnets are persistent\r\nand voracious eaters of early fruits, especially cherries and apricots,\r\nevery fruit raiser hi California will bear testimony. That the damage\r\nis often serious no one will deny. It is noticeable, however, that the\r\nearliest varieties are the ones most affected; also, that in large\r\norchards the damage is not perceptible, while in small plantations the\r\nwhole crop is frequently destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRACKLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crow blackbird or grackle[35] (fig. 11) in one or more of its\r\nsubspecies is a familiar object in all the States east of the Rocky\r\nMountains. Throughout the year it is resident as far north as southern\r\nIllinois, and in summer extends its range into the Canadian Provinces.\r\nIn the Mississippi Valley it is one of the most abundant of birds,\r\npreferring to nest in the artificial groves and windbreaks near farms\r\ninstead of in the natural \"timber\" which it formerly used. It breeds also\r\nin parks and near buildings, often in considerable colonies. Farther\r\neast, in New England, it is only locally abundant, though frequently seen\r\nin migration. In the latter days of August and throughout September it is\r\nfound in immense numbers before moving southward.\r\n\r\n[35] _Quiscalus quiscula_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Purple grackle. Length, about 12 inches.]\r\n\r\nThe grackle is accused of many sins, such as stealing grain and fruit and\r\nrobbing the nests of other birds. An examination of 2,346 stomachs shows\r\nthat nearly one-third of its food consists of insects, most of which are\r\ninjurious. The bird also eats a few snails, crawfishes, salamanders,\r\nsmall fish, and occasionally a mouse. The stomach contents do not\r\nindicate that it robs other birds' nests to any great extent, as remains\r\nof birds and birds' eggs amount to less than half of 1 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt is on account of its vegetable food that the grackle most deserves\r\ncondemnation. Grain is eaten during the whole year, and only for a short\r\ntime in summer is other food attractive enough to induce the bird to\r\nalter its diet. The grain taken in winter and spring probably consists of\r\nwaste kernels from stubble. The stomachs do not indicate that the bird\r\npulls sprouting grain; but the wheat eaten in July and August and the\r\ncorn eaten in the fall are probably from fields of standing grain. The\r\ntotal amount of grain consumed during the year constitutes 45 per cent\r\nof the food, but it is safe to say that at least half is waste grain and\r\nconsequently of no value. Although the crow blackbird eats a few cherries\r\nand blackberries in their season, and in the fall some wild fruit, it\r\napparently does no damage in this way.\r\n\r\nLarge flocks of grackles no doubt do considerable injury to grain crops,\r\nand there seems to be no remedy, except the destruction of the birds,\r\nwhich is in itself expensive. During the breeding season, however, the\r\nspecies does much good by eating insects and by feeding them to its\r\nyoung, which are reared almost entirely upon this food. The bird does the\r\ngreatest amount of good in spring, when it follows the plow in search of\r\nlarge grubworms, of which it is so fond that it sometimes literally crams\r\nits stomach full of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBREWER BLACKBIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Brewer blackbird[36] takes the place in the Western States of the\r\ngrackle, or crow blackbird, which lives in the Mississippi Valley and\r\nfarther east and is very similar in appearance and habits. It breeds east\r\nto the Great Plains and north into Canada, and winters over most of its\r\nbreeding range in the United States and south to Guatemala. At home in\r\nfields, meadows, and orchards, and about ranch buildings and cultivated\r\nlands generally, it nests in bushes and weeds, sometimes in trees, and is\r\nvery gregarious, especially about barnyards and corrals. The bird feeds\r\nfreely in stockyards and in cultivated fields, and when fruit is ripe\r\ndoes not hesitate to take a share During the cherry season in California\r\nthe birds are much in the orchards. In one case they were observed\r\nfeeding on cherries, but when a neighboring fruit grower began to plow\r\nhis orchard almost every blackbird in the vicinity was upon the newly\r\nopened ground close after the plowman's heels in its eagerness to secure\r\nthe insects turned up.\r\n\r\n[36] _Euphagus cyanocephalus_.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory investigation of this bird's food covered 312 stomachs,\r\ncollected in every month and representing especially the fruit and grain\r\nsections of southern California. The animal portion of the food was 32\r\nper cent and the vegetable 68 per cent.\r\n\r\nCaterpillars and their pupæ amounted to 12 per cent of the whole food\r\nand were eaten every month. They include many of those pests known as\r\ncutworms. The cotton-boll worm, or corn-ear worm, was identified in at\r\nleast 10 stomachs, and in 11 were found pupæ of the codling moth. The\r\nanimal food also included other insects, and spiders, sow bugs, snails,\r\nand eggshells.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable food may be divided into fruit, grain, and weed seeds.\r\nFruit was eaten in May, June, and July, not a trace appearing in any\r\nother month, and was composed of cherries, or what was thought to be\r\nsuch, strawberries, blackberries or raspberries, and fruit pulp or skins\r\nnot further identified. However, the amount, a little more than 4 per\r\ncent for the year, was too small to make a bad showing, and if the bird\r\ndoes no greater harm than is involved in its fruit eating it is well\r\nworth protecting. Grain amounts to 54 per cent of the yearly food and\r\nforms a considerable percentage in each month; oats are the favorite and\r\nwere the sole contents of 14 stomachs, and wheat of 2, but no stomach\r\nwas completely filled with any other grain. Weed seeds, eaten in every\r\nmonth to the extent of 9 per cent of the food, were found in rather small\r\nquantities and irregularly, and appear to have been merely a makeshift.\r\n\r\nStomachs of nestlings, varying in age from 24 hours to some that were\r\nnearly fledged, were found to contain 89 per cent animal to 11 per cent\r\nvegetable matter. The largest items in the former were caterpillars,\r\ngrasshoppers, and spiders. In the latter the largest items were fruit,\r\nprobably cherries; grain, mostly oats; and rubbish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE ORIOLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Baltimore oriole. Length, about 7½ Inches.]\r\n\r\nBrilliancy of plumage, sweetness of song, and food habits to which no\r\nexception can be taken are some of the striking characteristics of the\r\nBaltimore oriole[37] (fig. 12). In summer it is found throughout the\r\nnorthern half of the United States east of the Great Plains. Its nest\r\ncommands hardly less admiration than the beauty of its plumage or the\r\nexcellence of its song. Hanging from the tip of the outermost bough of\r\na stately elm, it is almost inaccessible to depredators and so strongly\r\nfastened as to bid defiance to the elements.\r\n\r\n[37] _Icterus galbula_.\r\n\r\nObservation both in the field and laboratory shows that caterpillars\r\nconstitute the largest item of the fare of the oriole. In 204 stomachs\r\nthey formed 34 per cent of the food, and they are eaten in varying\r\nquantities during all the months in which the bird remains in this\r\ncountry. The fewest are eaten in July, when a little fruit also is taken.\r\nThe other insects consist of beetles, bugs, ants, wasps, grasshoppers,\r\nand some spiders. The beetles are principally click beetles, the larvæ of\r\nwhich are among the most destructive insects known; and the bugs include\r\nplant and bark lice, both very harmful, but so small and obscure as to\r\nbe passed over unnoticed by most birds. Ants are eaten mostly in spring,\r\ngrasshoppers in July and August, and wasps and spiders with considerable\r\nregularity throughout the season.\r\n\r\nDuring the stay of the oriole in the United States, vegetable matter\r\namounts to only a little more than 16 per cent of its food, so that the\r\npossibility of its doing much damage to crops is very limited. The bird\r\nis accused of eating peas to a considerable extent, but remains of such\r\nwere found in only two cases. One writer says that it damages grapes, but\r\nnone were found in the stomachs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBULLOCK ORIOLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bullock oriole[38] is practically a counterpart of the Baltimore\r\noriole, taking the place of that species west of the Plains and\r\nthroughout the Pacific coast region. It does not essentially differ in\r\nits habits of nesting or in its food from its eastern relative, but it\r\nis less beautiful in plumage. The examination of 162 stomachs shows\r\nthat 79 per cent of its food consists of insects, with a few spiders, a\r\nlizard, a mollusk shell, and eggshells. Beetles amounted to 35 per cent,\r\nand all except a few ladybugs were harmful species. Ants were found in\r\n19 stomachs, and in one there was nothing else. Bees, wasps, etc., were\r\nin 56 stomachs, and entirely filled 2 of them. Including the ants, they\r\namount to nearly 15 per cent of the food of the season.\r\n\r\n[38] _Icterus bullocki_.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting articles of food in the oriole's dietary was\r\nthe black olive scale, found in 45 stomachs, and amounting to 5 per cent\r\nof the food. In several cases these scales formed 80 per cent or more of\r\nthe contents, and in one, 30 individual scales could be counted. They\r\nwere evidently a standard article of diet, and were eaten regularly in\r\nevery month of the oriole's stay except April. Hemipterous insects other\r\nthan scales, eaten quite regularly, make up a little more than 5 per cent\r\nof the food. They were mostly stinkbugs, leaf hoppers, and tree hoppers.\r\nPlant lice were found in one stomach.\r\n\r\nMoths, pupæ, and caterpillars compose the largest item of the oriole's\r\nanimal food; the average consumption during its summer stay Is a little\r\nmore than 41 per cent. Of these, perhaps the most interesting were the\r\npupæ and larvæ of the codling moth. These were found in 23 stomachs,\r\nshowing that they are not an unusual article of diet. No less than 14 of\r\nthe pupal cases were found in one stomach, and as they are very fragile\r\nmany others may have been present, but broken beyond recognition.\r\n\r\nGrasshoppers probably do not come much in the oriole's way. They were\r\neaten, however; to the extent of a little more than 3 per cent. But in\r\nspite of the fact that grasshoppers are eaten so sparingly, 2 stomachs,\r\nboth taken in June, contained nothing else, and another contained 97 per\r\ncent of them.\r\n\r\nVarious insects and spiders, with a few other items, make up the rest of\r\nthe animal food, a little more than 5 per cent. Spiders are not important\r\nin the oriole's food, but are probably eaten whenever found. They were\r\nidentified in 44 stomachs, but in small numbers. The scales of a lizard\r\nwere found in one stomach and the shell of a snail in another.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable contingent of the oriole's food is mostly fruit, especially\r\nin June and July, when it takes kindly to cherries and apricots, and\r\nsometimes eats more than the fruit grower considers a fair share.\r\nHowever, no great complaint is made against the bird, and it is probable\r\nthat as a rule it does not do serious harm. With such a good record as an\r\ninsect eater it can well be spared a few cherries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEADOWLARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eastern meadowlark[39] (fig. 13) is a common and well-known bird\r\noccurring from the Atlantic coast to the Great Plains, where it gives\r\nway to the closely related western species,[40] which extends thence\r\nwestward to the Pacific. It winters from our southern border as far north\r\nas the District of Columbia, southern Illinois, and occasionally Iowa.\r\nThe western, form winters somewhat farther north. Although it is a bird\r\nof the plains, and finds its most congenial haunts in the prairies of the\r\nWest, it is at home wherever there is level or undulating land covered\r\nwith grass or weeds, with plenty of water at hand.\r\n\r\n[39] _Sturnella magna_.\r\n\r\n[40] _Sturnella neglecta_.\r\n\r\nIn the 1,514 stomachs examined, animal food (practically all insects)\r\nconstituted 74 per cent of the contents and vegetable matter 26 per cent.\r\nAs would naturally be supposed, the insects were ground species, as\r\nbeetles, bugs, grasshoppers, and caterpillars, with a few flies, wasps,\r\nand spiders. A number of the stomachs were collected when the ground\r\nwas covered with snow, but even these contained a large percentage of\r\ninsects, showing the bird's skill in finding proper food under adverse\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nOf the various insects eaten, crickets and grasshoppers are the most\r\nimportant, constituting 26 per cent of the food of the year and 72 per\r\ncent of the food in August. It is scarcely necessary to mention the\r\nbeneficial effect of a number of these birds on a field of grass in the\r\nheight of the grasshopper season. Of the 1,514 stomachs collected at\r\nall seasons of the year, 778, or more than half, contained remains of\r\ngrasshoppers, and one was filled with fragments of 37 of these insects.\r\nThis seems to show conclusively that grasshoppers are preferred, and\r\nare eaten whenever they can be found. Especially notable is the great\r\nnumber taken in August, the month when grasshoppers reach their maximum\r\nabundance; stomach examination shows that large numbers of birds resort\r\nat this time to this diet, no matter what may be the food during the rest\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\nNext to grasshoppers, beetles make up the most important item of the\r\nmeadowlark's food, amounting to 25 per cent, about one-half of which are\r\npredacious ground beetles. The others are all harmful species.\r\n\r\nForty-two individuals of different kinds of May beetles were found in\r\nthe stomachs of meadowlarks, and there were probably many more which\r\nwere past recognition. To this form and several closely allied ones\r\nbelong the numerous white grubs, which are among the worst enemies to\r\nmany cultivated crops, notably grasses and grains, and to a less extent\r\nstrawberries and garden vegetables. In the larval stage they eat the\r\nroots of these plants, and being large, one individual may destroy\r\nseveral plants. In the adult stage they feed upon the foliage of trees\r\nand other plants, and in this way add to the damage which they began in\r\nthe earlier form. As these enemies of husbandry are not easily destroyed\r\nby man, it is obviously wise to encourage their natural foes.\r\n\r\nAmong the weevils found in the stomachs the most important economically\r\nare the cotton-boll weevil and the recently introduced alfalfa weevil\r\nof Utah. Several hundred meadowlarks were taken in the cotton-growing\r\nregion, and the boll weevil was found in 25 stomachs of the eastern\r\nmeadowlark and in 16 of the western species. Of the former, one stomach\r\ncontained 27 individuals. Of 25 stomachs of western meadowlarks taken in\r\nalfalfa fields of Utah, 15 contained the alfalfa weevil. In one stomach\r\n23 adults were found, in another 32 adults and 70 larvæ, still another\r\nhad 10 adults and 40 larvæ, and a fourth had 4 adults and 100 larvæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Meadowlark. Length, about 10 inches.]\r\n\r\nCaterpillars form a very constant element of the food, and in May\r\nconstitute over 24 per cent of the whole. May is the month when the\r\ndreaded cutworm begins Its deadly career, and then the lark does some of\r\nits best work. Most of these caterpillars are ground feeders, and are\r\noverlooked by birds which habitually frequent trees, but the meadowlark\r\nfinds and devours them by thousands. The remainder of the insect food is\r\nmade up of ants, wasps, and spiders, with some bugs, including chinch\r\nbugs, and a few scales.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable food consists of grain and weed and other hard seeds. Grain\r\nin general amounts to 11 per cent and weed and other seeds to 7 per cent.\r\nGrain, principally corn, is eaten mostly in winter and early spring\r\nand consists, therefore, of waste kernels; only a trifle is consumed\r\nin summer and autumn, when it is most plentiful. No trace of sprouting\r\ngrain was discovered. Glover seed was found in only six stomachs, and but\r\nlittle in each. Seeds of weeds, principally ragweed, barnyard grass, and\r\nsmartweed, are eaten from November to April, inclusive, but during the\r\nrest of the year are replaced by insects.\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, more than half of the meadowlark's food consists of\r\nharmful insects; its vegetable food is composed either of noxious weeds\r\nor waste grain; and the remainder is made up of useful beetles or\r\nneutral insects and spiders. A strong point in the bird's favor is that,\r\nalthough naturally an insect eater, it is able to subsist on vegetable\r\nfood, and consequently is not forced to migrate in cold weather farther\r\nthan is necessary to find ground free from snow.\r\n\r\nTHE RED-WINGED BLACKBIRDS.\r\n\r\nThe red-winged or swamp blackbird[41] in its various forms (fig. 14) is\r\nfound all over the United States and the region immediately to the north.\r\nWhile common in most of its range, its distribution is more or less\r\nlocal, mainly on account of its partiality for marshes. It builds its\r\nnest over or near standing water, in tall grass, rushes, or bushes. Owing\r\nto this peculiarity the bird may be absent from large tracts of country\r\nwhich afford no swamps or marshes suitable for nesting. It usually breeds\r\nin large colonies, though single families, consisting of a male and\r\nseveral females, may sometimes be found in a small slough, where each\r\nfemale builds her nest and rears her own little brood. While her liege\r\nlord displays his brilliant colors and struts in the sunshine. In the\r\nupper Mississippi Valley the species finds most favorable conditions, for\r\nthe countless prairie sloughs and the margins of the numerous shallow\r\nlakes afford nesting sites for thousands of red-wings; and here are bred\r\nthe immense flocks which sometimes do so much damage to the grain fields\r\nof the West. After the breeding season the birds congregate preparatory\r\nto migration, and remain thus associated throughout the winter.\r\n\r\n[41] _Agelaius phœniceus_.\r\n\r\nThree species and several subspecies of red-wings are recognized,[42]\r\nbut practically no difference exists in the habits of these forms either\r\nin nesting or feeding, except such as may result from local conditions.\r\nMost of the forms are found on the Pacific side of the continent, and\r\nmay be considered as included in the following statements as to food and\r\neconomic status.\r\n\r\n[42] Agelaius phœniceus (8 forms), Agelaius gubernator, and Agelaius\r\ntricolor.\r\n\r\nMany complaints have been made against the red-wing, and several States\r\nhave at times placed a bounty upon its head. It is said to cause great\r\ndamage to grain in the West, especially in the upper Mississippi Valley,\r\nbut few complaints come from the northeastern section, where the bird is\r\nmuch less abundant than in the West and South.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Red-winged blackbird. Length, about 9½\r\nInches.]\r\n\r\nExamination of 1,083 stomachs showed that vegetable matter forms 74 per\r\ncent of the food, while animal matter, mainly Insects, forms but 26 per\r\ncent A little more than 10 per cent consists of beetles, mostly harmful\r\nspecies. Weevils, or snout beetles, amount to 4 per cent of the year's\r\nfood, but in June reach 25 per cent. As weevils are among the most\r\nharmful insects known, their destruction should condone some, at least,\r\nof the sins of which the bird is accused. Grasshoppers constitute nearly\r\n5 per cent of the food, while the rest of the animal matter is made up\r\nof various insects, a few snails, and crustaceans. The few dragon flies\r\nfound were probably picked up dead, for they are too active to be taken\r\nalive, unless by a bird of the flycatcher family. So far as the insect\r\nfood as a whole is concerned, the red-wing may be considered entirely\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\nThe interest in the vegetable food of this bird centers around grain.\r\nOnly three kinds, corn, wheat, and oats, were found in the stomachs\r\nin appreciable quantities. They aggregate but little more than 13\r\nper cent of the whole food, oats forming nearly half of this amount.\r\nField investigation has shown, however, that, when local conditions\r\nare favorable, large flocks of red-wings may do considerable damage.\r\nConspicuous among such cases are the losses suffered by farmers to sweet\r\ncorn in some of the northeastern States and to milo in the South and\r\nWest. In the rather limited grain-raising area of the Imperial Valley\r\nof California the annual damage to milo alone by enormous flocks of\r\nred-wings and yellow-headed blackbirds has been estimated to be fully\r\n$50,000. The most important item of the bird's food, however, is weed\r\nseed, which forms practically all of its food in winter and about 57\r\nper cent of the fare of the whole year. The principal weed seeds eaten\r\nare those of ragweed, barnyard grass, and smartweed. That these seeds\r\nare preferred is shown by the fact that the birds begin to eat them in\r\nAugust, when grain is still readily obtainable, and continue feeding on\r\nthem even after insects become plentiful in April. The red-wing eats very\r\nlittle fruit and does practically no harm to garden or orchard. It is\r\napparent that where moderately abundant, the red-wing does more good than\r\nharm, but in sections where it becomes excessively abundant a reduction\r\nin its numbers is justifiable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOBOLINK.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Bobolink, ricebird, or reed bird. Length, about\r\n7 inches.]\r\n\r\nThe bobolink, ricebird, or reedbird[43] (fig. 15) is a common summer\r\nresident of the United States, north of about latitude 40°, and from\r\nNew England westward to the Great Plains, wintering beyond our southern\r\nborder. In New England there are few birds about which so much romance\r\nclusters as this rollicking songster, naturally associated with sunny\r\nJune meadows; but in the South there are none on whose head so many\r\nmaledictions have been heaped on account of its fondness for rice. During\r\nits sojourn in the Northern States it feeds mainly upon insects and seeds\r\nof useless plants; but while rearing its young, insects constitute its\r\nchief food, and almost the exclusive diet of its brood. After the young\r\nare able to fly, the whole family gathers into a small flock and begins\r\nto live almost entirely upon vegetable food. This consists for the most\r\npart of weed seeds, since In the North these birds do not appear to\r\nattack grain to any great extent. They eat a few oats, but their stomachs\r\ndo not reveal a great quantity of this or any other grain. As the season\r\nadvances they gather into larger flocks and move southward, until by the\r\nend of August nearly all have left their breeding grounds. On their way\r\nthey frequent the reedy marshes about the mouths of rivers and on the\r\ninland waters of the coast region and subsist largely upon wild rice. In\r\nthe Middle States, during their southward migration, they are commonly\r\nknown as reedbirds, and, becoming very fat, are treated as game.\r\n\r\n[43] _Dolichonyx oryzivorus_.\r\n\r\nFormerly, when the low marshy shores of the Carolinas and some of the\r\nmore southern States were devoted to rice culture the bobolinks made\r\ngreat havoc both upon the sprouting rice in spring and upon the ripening\r\ngrain on their return migration in the fall. While the damage is not\r\nso great as when this region was the center of rice production, still\r\nit amounts to many thousands of dollars annually. As a remedy, an open\r\nseason on ricebirds was provided in the Coast States from New Jersey to\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one or another of its geographic races the common crow[44] (fig. 16)\r\nbreeds in great numbers throughout the States east of the Plains and\r\nfrom the Gulf well up into Canada, while in less abundance it is found\r\nin California and in the Northwestern States. During the colder months a\r\nsouthern migratory movement brings most of these birds within the borders\r\nof the United States, and at about the latitude of Philadelphia and\r\nsouthern Illinois we find them congregating nightly in roosts. Farmers\r\ndwelling in the vicinity of such roosts frequently suffer losses to\r\nshocked corn.\r\n\r\n[44] _Corvus brachyrhynchos_.\r\n\r\nIn fact, none of our native birds so much concerns the average farmer of\r\nthe Eastern States as the common crow. Many of our present criticisms\r\nof this bird, as its pulling sprouting corn, feeding on ripening ears,\r\ndamaging fruits of various kinds, destroying poultry and wild birds,\r\nand disseminating diseases of live-stock, were common complaints in the\r\ndays of the early colonists. Many of the virtues of the crow, now quite\r\ngenerally recognized, also have been matters of record for many years. In\r\nrecent times, however, scientific study of these problems, including the\r\nexamination of the stomachs of hundreds of crows secured in every month\r\nof the year and under a variety of conditions, has enabled us to render a\r\nmuch fairer verdict than was formerly possible.\r\n\r\nThe crow is practically omnivorous. During spring and early summer any\r\nform of insect life seems to make a desirable item in its diet, and in\r\nwinter when hard pressed nothing in the animal or vegetable kingdoms\r\nwhich contains a morsel of nutriment is overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe insect food of the crow, which comprises about a fifth of its yearly\r\nsustenance, does much to atone for its misdemeanors. Grasshoppers,\r\nMay beetles and their larvæ (white grubs), caterpillars, weevils, and\r\nwireworms stand out prominently. In 1,340 stomachs of adults examined\r\nthese highly Injurious forms comprised over 80 per cent of the insect\r\nfood. Grasshoppers are naturally taken in greatest abundance late in the\r\nseason. September being the month of largest consumption, when they form\r\nabout a fifth of the total food. May beetles and white grubs are eaten\r\nin every month, but occur most prominently in May. In June caterpillars\r\nare a favorite food, and weevils of various kinds are taken in varying\r\nquantities throughout summer and fall. About half of the remaining\r\n20 per cent of insect food is composed of beneficial ground beetles,\r\nladybirds, predacious bugs, and parasitic wasps, and related forms, the\r\nrest consisting of neutral or injurious forms. Numerous instances are on\r\nrecord where fields badly infested with white grubs or grasshoppers have\r\nbeen favorite resorts of crows, whose voracity has resulted in a material\r\nsuppression of the pest. When the amount of food required to sustain the\r\nindividual crow is considered, the work of these birds appears all the\r\nmore important Single stomachs containing upward of 50 grasshoppers are\r\nnot uncommon. Thus in its choice of insect food the crow is rendering an\r\nimportant service to the farmer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Crow. Length, about 19 inches.]\r\n\r\nIn the other animal food of the crow are several items of the utmost\r\neconomic importance. Spiders are taken in considerable numbers in May and\r\nJune, but the yearly total is a little over 1 per cent of the food. In\r\nearly spring crawfish are eagerly sought, and other aquatic food, as fish\r\nand mollusks, lend variety to the crow's bill of fare the year round.\r\nIn the consumption of toads, salamanders, frogs, and some snakes, which\r\ntogether compose a little over 2 per cent of the yearly food, the crow is\r\ndoubtless doing harm. Small rodents occurred in the stomachs collected\r\nnearly every month, but it Is often difficult to determine whether small\r\nmammals found in birds' stomachs were taken alive or found dead.\r\n\r\nFrom its carrion-eating habits the crow has been unfairly criticized as\r\na disseminator of live-stock diseases. While this may be to some extent\r\njust, the fact that there are many other important carriers which lie\r\nlargely beyond our control, shows that we must seek final relief only\r\nthrough the strictest methods of sanitation.\r\n\r\nThe nest-robbing habit of the crow, long a serious criticism, is verified\r\nby stomach analysis. Of the 1,103 crows examined, 47 had fed on wild\r\nbirds or their eggs, and the eggs of domestic fowls were found somewhat\r\nmore frequently. The crow's habit of rummaging about garbage piles may\r\nexplain much of this latter material.\r\n\r\nOf the vegetable food, corn, which is eaten every month, is the most\r\nimportant item and forms about 38 per cent of the diet. Much of this,\r\nhowever, must be considered waste, since over 60 per cent of it is\r\nconsumed from the first of November to the end of March. During the\r\nperiods when corn is sprouting and when in the \"roasting-ear\" stage the\r\ncrow is eating this grain at a rate considerably less than the yearly\r\naverage, and the months of smallest consumption are July and August. At\r\ntimes, however, the damage to corn becomes a serious problem, and were\r\nit not possible to make use of such deterrents as coal tar upon seed\r\ncorn there would be little friendship for the crow in some sections of\r\nthe East. The \"pulling\" of corn is a trait most prevalent in small-field\r\nareas. Wheat and oats suffer similar damage at times, especially in the\r\nNorthwestern States, where these grains predominate. About the only\r\nsafeguard to ripening grain is the constant use of powder and shot or the\r\nscarecrow.\r\n\r\nVarious kinds of cultivated fruits are also eaten, and local damage\r\nto such crops as apples, melons, peas, beans, peanuts, and almonds is\r\noccasionally reported. In long, rigorous winters, the crow, like other\r\nbirds, resorts to the fruit of numerous wild plants, as dogwood, sour\r\ngum, hackberry, smilax, and the several species of sumac and poison ivy.\r\n\r\nDamage to the eggs of poultry may be reduced to a minimum by careful\r\nhousing of lasting hens, and the farmer can protect his sprouting grain\r\nto a large extent by the use of tar-coated seed. It will be well also\r\nto keep the crow within reasonable numbers on game preserves and public\r\nparks where it is desired to encourage the nesting of smaller birds.\r\nWhile legal protection is not needed for so wary an individual as the\r\ncrow, it seems well, where local conditions have not aggravated some\r\nparticular shortcomings of the bird, to allow it to continue the good\r\nservices gendered to man in the destruction of noxious insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE JAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blue jay[45] (fig. 17) is a conspicuous member of our bird population\r\neast of the Plains, especially in autumn when his brilliant plumage\r\ncontrasts vividly with the brown> foliage. Even in winter he stays with\r\nus, though at this time he is less common along our northern border. In\r\nspring and summer, while by no means uncommon, the blue jay is not so\r\noften noticed, as the retiring disposition which he assumes during the\r\nbreeding season assists in protecting him from enemies. This also allows\r\nhim to carry on with considerable impunity that inglorious practice of\r\nnest robbing of which, in a measure, he has been rightfully accused.\r\n\r\n[45] _Cyanocitta cristata_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Blue Jay. Length, about 11½ inches.]\r\n\r\nExamination of 530 stomachs collected at all times of the year in 30\r\nof our Eastern States and Canada shows that insects comprise about 22\r\nper cent of the yearly sustenance. About three-fourths of these are\r\ninjurious, the remainder being neutral or beneficial. Of the injurious\r\ninsects, grasshoppers form the largest portion; in August nearly a fifth\r\nof the food. Caterpillars are conspicuous in July and August and at this\r\ntime average about a tenth of the stomach contents. Both laboratory\r\ninvestigations and field observations have established the fact that in\r\nwinter the eggs of the tent caterpillar and the hibernating larvæ of the\r\nbrown-tail moth in New England are eagerly sought Scarabæid beetles form\r\nabout 4 per cent of the yearly food, and click beetles and wire-worms\r\nabout 1 per cent. Of the beneficial forms, ground beetles (3 per cent)\r\nand hymenopterous insects, part of which are parasitic (2.5 per cent),\r\nare taken most frequently. A few other invertebrates, as spiders,\r\nmillipedes, mollusks, and crustaceans, also are eaten throughout the year.\r\n\r\nIn the consideration of the vertebrate food of the blue jay we are\r\nconfronted with the problem of the destruction of wild birds and their\r\neggs. Special search was made for every possible trace of such material\r\nin the stomachs, and in 6 of the 530 were found the remains of wild birds\r\nor their eggs. In February two jays had killed a small bird apiece; in\r\nMay one had robbed a nest of eggs; in June two had taken a small bird and\r\na clutch of eggs, respectively; and in August another had robbed a nest\r\nAs this trait of the jay appears to be most pronounced during its own\r\nbreeding season, it is quite possible for many birds which have suffered\r\nfrom its boldness early in the season to raise another brood unmolested.\r\nThirty-nine of the 530 jays examined had fed on hen's eggs. Much of this\r\nfood, however, was picked up about rubbish heaps, to which the jay, like\r\nother members of the crow family, is partial. While the result of stomach\r\nanalysis would appear to belittle this fault of the blue jay, it is\r\ndoubtless quite characteristic of the bird under favorable conditions.\r\n\r\nComplaint that the jay is the source of considerable damage to corn in\r\nthe fall has been verified to a certain degree by stomach examination.\r\nThis grain is taken in every month of the year, but in greater\r\nquantities during winter and early spring, when much of it is necessarily\r\nwaste, and it forms about 18 per cent of the yearly food. Cultivated\r\nfruits of various kinds are eaten from June to the end of the year, and\r\nthe 15 per cent taken in July apparently justifies complaints against\r\nthe bird on this score. The favorite vegetable food of the blue jay is\r\nmast of various kinds, acorns predominating, but beechnuts, chestnuts,\r\nchinquaquins, and hazelnuts also are relished. This food is important in\r\nevery month but July and August, the yearly average being over 43 per\r\ncent, and from October to March it constitutes about two-thirds of the\r\ndiet. Occasionally harm is done by feeding also on cultivated nuts, as\r\npecans. Wild fruits are eaten during the summer and fall and constitute\r\nabout 7 per cent of the yearly sustenance.\r\n\r\nThe blue jay probably renders its best services to man in destroying\r\ngrasshoppers late in the season and in feeding on hibernating insects and\r\ntheir eggs, as it does in the case of the tent caterpillar and brown-tail\r\nmoth. Such forest insects as buprestid beetles and weevils of various\r\nkinds also fall as its prey.\r\n\r\nThe blue jay's vegetable food, with the exception of some cultivated\r\nfruit and corn in the fall, is largely neutral. The severest criticism\r\nagainst the species is the destruction of other birds and their eggs.\r\nWhere we wish to attract birds in large numbers about our dooryards, in\r\nour parks, and in game preserves, it will be well not to allow the jays\r\nto become too abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPACIFIC COAST JAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn California and adjacent States two species of jays are much in\r\nevidence under several more or less well-marked forms.\r\n\r\nThe Steller jay[46] much resembles the eastern bird, but it is more shy\r\nand retiring and seldom visits the orchard or vicinity of the ranch\r\nbuildings. Stomach examination shows that its food does not radically\r\ndiffer from that of the eastern blue jay. As is the case with that bird,\r\na very considerable part of the food consists of mast, together with\r\na little fruit and some insects. The insects are largely wasps, with\r\nsome beetles and grasshoppers. This jay also eats some grain, which is\r\nprobably waste or volunteer. No complaints, so far as known, are made\r\nagainst this bird. Until it shall become less wary it is not likely to\r\ntrespass to a serious extent upon the farmer's preserve.\r\n\r\n[46] _Cyanocitta stelleri_.\r\n\r\nThe California jay,[47] although of a different genus, more nearly\r\nresembles its eastern relative in food habits and actions. It freely\r\nvisits the stockyards near ranch buildings, and orchards and gardens. As\r\na fruit stealer it is notorious. One instance is recorded where seven\r\njays were shot from a prune tree, one after the other, the dead bodies\r\nbeing left under the tree until all were killed. So eager were the birds\r\nto get the fruit that the report of the gun and the sight of their dead\r\ndid not deter them from coming to the tree. In orchards in canyons or on\r\nhillsides adjacent to chaparral or other cover great mischief is done by\r\nthis bird. In one such case an orchard was under observation at a time\r\nwhen the prune crop was ripening, and jays in a continuous stream were\r\nseen to come down a small ravine to the orchard, prey upon the fruit, and\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n[47] _Aphelocoma californica_.\r\n\r\nFruit stealing, however, is only one of the sins of the California jay.\r\nThat it robs hens' nests is universal testimony. A case is reported of a\r\nhen having a nest under a clump of bushes; every day a jay came to a tree\r\na few rods away, and when it heard the cackle of the hen announcing a new\r\negg it flew at once to the nest. At the same time the mistress of the\r\nhouse hastened to the spot to secure the prize, but in most cases the jay\r\nwon the race. This is only one of many similar cases recounted. The jays\r\nhave learned just what the cackle of the hen means. Another case more\r\nserious is that related by a man engaged in raising white leghorn fowls\r\non a ranch several miles up a canyon. He stated that when the chicks were\r\nvery young the jays attacked and killed them by a few blows of the beak\r\nand then pecked open the skull and ate out the brains. In spite of all\r\nefforts to protect the chicks and kill the jays the losses in this way\r\nwere serious.\r\n\r\nExamination of the stomachs of 326 California jays shows that 27 per cent\r\nof the contents for the year consists of animal matter and 73 per cent\r\nof vegetable. Although the great bulk of the animal food is made up of\r\ninsects, the remains of eggshells and birds' bones appear much too often.\r\nThe insect food is fairly well distributed among the more common orders,\r\nbut grasshoppers are slightly the most numerous and constitute 4.5 per\r\ncent of the year's food. In July, August, and September, however, the\r\namount is 14, 18, and 19 per cent, respectively. Four per cent of the\r\nfood consists of wasps, bees, etc., but in the three months named they\r\nconstitute 15, 7, and 9 per cent, respectively. A worker honeybee found\r\nin each of two stomachs is rather surprising, for it is unusual to find\r\na bird like the jay eating these active and elusive insects, which enter\r\ninto the diet of the flycatchers. The remainder of the insect food is\r\npretty evenly distributed among beetles, bugs, flies, and caterpillars.\r\nEggshells were found in 21 stomachs and birds' bones in 5. Six stomachs\r\ncontained the bones of mammals and two those of a lizard. No bird has a\r\nworse reputation for nest robbing than has the eastern jay, and yet of\r\n530 stomachs of the eastern species only 6 contained eggshells or the\r\nbones of birds. This comparison serves to show what a marauder and nest\r\nthief the California jay really is.\r\n\r\nIn its vegetable diet this bird much resembles its eastern relative,\r\nthe most remarkable difference being in the matter of fruit eating.\r\nWith greater opportunities the California bird has developed a greater\r\nappetite for fruit and indulges it to the fullest extent. Remains of\r\nfruit were found in 220 of the 326 stomachs. The percentage for the year\r\nis only 16, but for the four months of June, July, August, and September\r\nit is 44, 33, 53, and 25, respectively. Cherries, apricots, and prunes\r\nare the favorites among cultivated fruits, and elderberries are relished\r\nto some extent. Grain, which was found in 48 stomachs, amounts to 6 per\r\ncent of the food of the year. Practically all of it was taken in the\r\nfour months above mentioned, but it is not probable that much damage\r\nis done by the jay in this respect. The major portion of the grain was\r\noats. What was not wild was probably simply scattered grain gleaned\r\nafter the harvest. Mast is eaten by the California jay from September\r\nto March, inclusive, and constitutes during most of that period one of\r\nthe principal elements of its food. In this respect the bird shows a\r\nremarkable similarity to the eastern species. A few weed seeds and other\r\nmiscellaneous items make up the balance of the vegetable food.\r\n\r\nIn summing up from an economic point of view the character of the food of\r\nthe California jay, it must be conceded that it is not all that could be\r\nwished. Its taste for birds' eggs and fruit is entirely too pronounced,\r\nand at present the species is superabundant in California. While the\r\nnatural food supply of the bird has been lessened by bringing the woods\r\nand brushy canyons under cultivation, the same areas have been planted to\r\nfruit, and naturally the jay takes the fruit as an acceptable substitute.\r\nA considerable reduction of the bird's numbers would appear to be the\r\nonly effective remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHŒBES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the early spring arrivals to their northern homes none is more\r\nwelcome than the phœbe (fig. 18). The common phœbe[48] breeds\r\nthroughout the United States east of the Great Plains, and winters from\r\nthe South Atlantic and Gulf States southward. Its western relative, the\r\nblack phœbe,[49] is found from Texas west to the Pacific coast, which\r\nit occupies as far north as Washington, replacing through most of this\r\nregion the common or eastern form.\r\n\r\n[48] _Sayornis phœbe_.\r\n\r\n[49] _Sayornis Nigricans_.\r\n\r\nThough naturally building its nest under an overhanging cliff of rock\r\nor earth, or in the mouth of a cave, the preference of the eastern\r\nspecies for the vicinity of farm buildings is so marked that in the more\r\nthickly settled parts of the country the bird is seldom seen at any\r\ngreat distance from a farmhouse, except where a bridge spanning a stream\r\naffords a secure spot for a nest. Its confiding disposition renders it a\r\ngreat favorite, and consequently it is seldom disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe phœbe subsists almost exclusively upon insects, most of which are\r\ncaught upon the wing. An examination of 370 stomachs showed that over 89\r\nper cent of the year's food consists of insects and spiders, while wild\r\nfruit constitutes the remainder. The insects belong chiefly to noxious\r\nspecies, and include many click beetles. May beetles, and weevils.\r\nOther beetles, belonging to 21 families that were identified, make up\r\n10.65 per cent. They appear to be eaten very regularly in every month,\r\nbut the most are taken in spring and early summer. May is the month of\r\nmaximum consumption, with 20.43 per cent. Beetles altogether amount to\r\n15.3 per cent, which places them second in rank of the items of animal\r\nfood. The notorious cotton-boll weevil was found in six stomachs taken\r\nin the cotton fields of Texas and Louisiana, and five individuals of the\r\nstrawberry weevil were taken from one collected in Texas. Many other\r\nbeetles contained In the stomachs are equally harmful, but are not so\r\nwidely known. Such are the corn leaf-beetle, which feeds upon corn; the\r\n12-spotted cucumber beetle, and the striped cucumber beetle, both of\r\nwhich seriously injure and sometimes destroy cucumber and squash vines;\r\nand the locust leaf miner, which is sometimes so numerous that all the\r\nlocust trees over large areas are blasted as by fire.\r\n\r\nIn the phœbe's diet hymenopterous insects stand at the head, as\r\nis the case with most of the flycatchers. They are eaten with great\r\nregularity and are the largest item in nearly every month. A few are\r\nuseful parasitic species, but these are offset by a number of sawfly\r\nlarvæ, which are very harmful insects. Ants were found in 24 stomachs.\r\nNo honeybees were identified. In their season grasshoppers are much\r\nrelished, while wasps of various forms, many flies of species that annoy\r\ncattle, and a few bugs and spiders are also eaten regularly. It is\r\nevident that a pair of phœbes must materially reduce the number of\r\ninsects near a garden or field, as the birds often, if not always, raise\r\ntwo broods a year, and each brood numbers from four to six young.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a more useful species about the farm than the phœbe,\r\nand it should receive every encouragement. To furnish nesting boxes is\r\nhelpful, but not necessary, as it usually prefers a more open situation,\r\nlike a shed or a nook under the eaves, but it should be protected from\r\ncats and other marauders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Phœbe. Length, about 6½ inches.]\r\n\r\nThe black phœbe has the same habits as its eastern relative, both as\r\nto selection of food and nesting sites, preferring for the latter purpose\r\nsome structure of man, as a shed or, better still, a bridge over a stream\r\nof water, and the preference of the black phœbe for the vicinity of\r\nwater is very pronounced. One may always be found at a stream' or pool\r\nand often at a watering trough by the roadside.\r\n\r\nCareful study of the habits of the bird shows that it obtains a large\r\nportion of Its food about wet places. While camping beside a stream in\r\nCalifornia the writer took some pains to observe the habits of the black\r\nphœbe. The nesting season was over, and the birds had nothing to do\r\nbut eat. This they appeared to be doing all the time. When first observed\r\nin the morning, at the first glimmer of daylight, a phœbe was always\r\nfound flitting from rock to rock, although it was so dusky that the bird\r\ncould hardly be seen. This activity was kept up all day. Even in the\r\nevening, when it was so dark that notes were written by the aid of the\r\ncamp fire, the phœbe was still engaged in its work of collecting,\r\nthough it was difficult to understand how it could catch insects when\r\nthere was scarcely light enough to see the bird. Exploration of the\r\nstream showed that every portion of it was patrolled by a phœbe, that\r\neach one apparently did not range over more than 12 or 13 rods of water,\r\nand that sometimes two or three were in close proximity.\r\n\r\nThe number of insects destroyed in a year by the black phœbe is\r\nenormous. Fortunately, the examination of stomachs has supplemented\r\nobservation in the field, and we are enabled to give precise details. Of\r\nthe 333 stomachs examined, every one contained insects as the great bulk\r\nof the food. Only 15 contained any vegetable food at all, and in no case\r\nwas it a considerable part of the contents of the stomach. The insects\r\neaten were mostly wasps, bugs, and flies, but many beetles also were\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nUseful beetles belonging to three families amount to 2.8 per cent of the\r\nfood. Other beetles of harmful or neutral species reach 10.5 per cent.\r\nWasps, the largest item of the food, were found in 252 stomachs and\r\nwere the whole contents of 15. The average for the year is 35 per cent.\r\nParasitic species were noted, but they were very few. Ants were found in\r\n48 stomachs, and for a short time in midsummer they constitute a notable\r\npart of the food. Various wild bees and wasps make up the bulk of this\r\nitem. No honeybees were found.\r\n\r\nBugs in various forms constitute 10.56 per cent and are eaten in every\r\nmonth but May. Stinkbugs appear to be the favorites, as they were\r\ncontained in 10 stomachs. Plant lice were found in one stomach. Flies,\r\nforming the second largest item, were found in 97 stomachs and completely\r\nfilled 3. They constitute the most regular article in the black\r\nphœbe's diet. The maximum consumption occurs in April, 64.3 per cent.\r\nThe black phœbe well merits its title of flycatcher.\r\n\r\nMoths and caterpillars amount to 8.2 per cent of the food. They were\r\nfound in 72 stomachs, of which 51 contained the adult moths and 28 the\r\nlarvæ or caterpillars. One stomach was entirely filled with adults. This\r\nis one of the few birds studied by the writer that eats more moths than\r\ncaterpillars, for as a rule the caterpillars are largely in excess.\r\nFlycatchers, taking their food upon the wing, would naturally prove\r\nexceptions to the rule. Crickets are evidently not a favorite food of the\r\nblack phœbe, as they amount to only 2.45 per cent. They were found in\r\n39 stomachs, but usually the amount in each was small, though one stomach\r\nwas entirely filled with them. Grasshoppers did not appear. Dragon flies\r\nwere eaten to some extent, and these illustrate the fondness of the\r\nspecies for the neighborhood of water.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable matter eaten consisted chiefly of small wild fruits of no\r\neconomic importance.\r\n\r\nAnother phœbe inhabiting the Western States and breeding as far north\r\nas Alaska is the Say phœbe.[50] Investigation of its food was based\r\non the examination of 86 stomachs, and while none were available for the\r\nmonths when insects are most numerous, the bird proved to be one of the\r\nmost exclusively insectivorous of the family. That it takes a few useful\r\ninsects can not be denied, but these are far outnumbered by the harmful\r\nones it destroys, and the balance is clearly in favor of the bird. Its\r\nvegetable food amounts to only 2 per cent and is made up of a little wild\r\nfruit, seeds, and rubbish.\r\n\r\n[50] _Sayornis sayus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KINGBIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe well-known eastern kingbird[51] (fig. 19) is essentially a lover of\r\nthe orchard, though groves and the edge of forests were probably its\r\noriginal habitat. It breeds in the States east of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nand less commonly in the Great Basin and on the Pacific coast. Its\r\nhostility to hawks and crows is proverbial, and for this reason a family\r\nof kingbirds is a desirable adjunct to a poultry yard. On one occasion\r\nin the knowledge of the writer a hawk which attacked a brood of young\r\nturkeys was pounced upon and so severely buffeted by a pair of kingbirds\r\nwhose nest was near by that the would-be robber was glad to escape\r\nwithout his prey. Song birds that nest near the kingbird are similarly\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\n[51] _Tyrannus tyrannus_.\r\n\r\nThe kingbird is largely insectivorous. It is a true flycatcher and takes\r\non the wing a large part of its food. It does not, however, confine\r\nitself to this method of hunting, but picks up some insects from trees\r\nand weeds, and even descends to the ground in search of myriapods\r\nor thousand legs. The chief complaint against the species by both\r\nprofessional bee keepers and others has been that it preys largely upon\r\nhoneybees. One bee raiser in Iowa, suspecting the kingbirds of feeding\r\nupon his bees, shot a number near his hives; but when the stomachs of the\r\nbirds were examined by an expert entomologist, not a trace of honeybees\r\ncould be found.\r\n\r\nAn examination of 665 stomachs collected in various parts of the\r\ncountry, was made by the Biological Survey, but only 22 were found to\r\ncontain remains of honeybees. In these 22 stomachs there were in all 61\r\nhoneybees, of which 51 were drones, 8 were certainly workers, and the\r\nremaining 2 were too badly broken to be further identified.\r\n\r\nThe insects that constitute the great bulk of the food of the bird\r\nare noxious species, largely beetles--May beetles, click beetles (the\r\nlarvæ of which are known as wire-worms), weevils, which prey upon\r\nfruit and grain, and a host of others. Wasps, wild bees, and ants are\r\nconspicuous elements of the food, far outnumbering the hive bees.\r\nDuring summer many grasshoppers and crickets, as well as leaf hoppers\r\nand other bugs, also are eaten. In the stomachs examined were a number\r\nof robber files--insects which prey largely upon other insects,\r\nincluding honeybees, and which are known to commit in this way extensive\r\ndepredations. It is thus evident that the kingbird by destroying these\r\nflies actually does good work for the apiarist. The 26 robber flies found\r\nin the stomachs may be considered more than an equivalent for the 8\r\nworker honeybees already mentioned. A few caterpillars are eaten, mostly\r\nbelonging to the group commonly known as cutworms, all the species of\r\nwhich are harmful.\r\n\r\nAbout 11 per cent of the food consists of small native fruits, comprising\r\nsome 30 common species of the roadsides and thickets, as dogwood berries,\r\nelderberries, and wild grapes. The kingbird is not reported as eating\r\ncultivated fruit to an injurious extent, and it is very doubtful if this\r\nis ever the case.\r\n\r\nIn the Western States the Arkansas kingbird[52] is not so domestic in\r\nits habits as its eastern relative, preferring to live among scattering\r\noaks on lonely hillsides, rather than in orchards about ranch buildings.\r\nThe work it does, however, in the destruction of noxious insects fully\r\nequals that of any member of its family. Like other flycatchers, it\r\nsubsists mostly upon insects taken in mid-air, though it eats a number\r\nof grasshoppers, probably taken from the ground. The bulk of its food\r\nconsists of beetles, bugs, wasps, and wild bees. Like its eastern\r\nrepresentative, it has been accused of feeding to an injurious extent\r\nupon honeybees. In an examination of 62 stomachs of this species,\r\ngreat care was taken to identify every insect or fragment that had any\r\nresemblance to a honeybee; as a result, 30 honeybees were identified, of\r\nwhich 29 were males or drones and 1 a worker. These were contained in\r\nfour stomachs, and were the sole contents of three; in the fourth they\r\nconstituted 99 per cent of the food. It is evident that the bee-eating\r\nhabit is only occasional and accidental, rather than habitual; and it is\r\nalso evident that if this ratio of drones to workers were maintained, the\r\nbird would be of more benefit than harm to the apiary.\r\n\r\n[52] _Tyrannus verticalis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Kingbird. Length, about 8½ inches.]\r\n\r\nThe Cassin kingbird[53] has a more southerly range than the Arkansas\r\nflycatcher. Examination of a number of stomachs shows that its food\r\nhabits are similar to those of others of the group.\r\n\r\n[53] _Tyrannus vociferans_.\r\n\r\nThree points seem to be clearly established in regard to the food of\r\nthe kingbirds--(1) that about 90 per cent consists of insects, mostly\r\ninjurious species; (2) that the alleged habit of preying upon honeybees\r\nis much less prevalent than has been supposed, and probably does not\r\nresult in any great damage; and (3) that the vegetable food consists\r\nalmost entirely of wild fruits which have no economic value.\r\n\r\nAll of the kingbirds are of the greatest importance to the farmer and\r\nfruit grower, as they destroy vast numbers of harmful insects, and do no\r\nappreciable damage to any product of cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHTHAWK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nighthawk, or bull-bat,[54] breeds throughout most of the United\r\nStates and Canada, and winters in South America. It is strictly\r\ninsectivorous, and hence does no damage to crops. The only charge that\r\ncan be made against the bird is that it destroys some useful insects, but\r\nthese are greatly in the minority in its food.\r\n\r\n[54] _Chordeiles virginianus_.\r\n\r\nNighthawks are so expert in flight that no insects can escape them. In\r\ntheir capacious mouths they sweep up everything from the largest moths\r\nand dragon flies to the tiniest ants and gnats, and in this way sometimes\r\ngather most remarkable collections of insects. Several stomachs have\r\ncontained 50 or more different kinds, and the number of individuals ran\r\ninto the thousands.\r\n\r\nNearly a fourth of the birds' total food is composed of ants. These\r\nInsects are generally annoying and often very injurious, especially on\r\naccount of their damage to stored products and because of their habit of\r\nfostering destructive plant lice. More than a fifth of the nighthawk's\r\nfood consists of June bugs, dung beetles, and other beetles of the\r\nleaf-chafer family. These are the adults of white grubs, noted pests, and\r\neven as adults many members of the family are decidedly harmful.\r\n\r\nNumerous other injurious beetles, as click beetles, wood borers, and\r\nweevils, are relished. True bugs, moths, flies, grasshoppers, and\r\ncrickets also are important elements of the food. Several species of\r\nmosquitoes, including the transmitter of malaria, are eaten. Other\r\nwell-known pests consumed by the nighthawk are Colorado potato beetles,\r\ncucumber beetles, rice, clover-leaf, and cotton-boll weevils, billbugs,\r\nbark beetles, squash bugs, and moths of the cotton worm.\r\n\r\nNighthawks are much less numerous than formerly, chiefly because of\r\nwanton shooting. They are given full legal protection almost everywhere,\r\nand citizens should see that the law is obeyed. The bird is far too\r\nuseful and attractive to be persecuted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOODPECKERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Hairy woodpecker. Length, about 9 inches.]\r\n\r\nFive or six species of woodpeckers are familiarly known throughout the\r\neastern United States, and In the West are replaced by others of similar\r\nhabits. Several species remain in the Northern States through the entire\r\nyear, while others are more or less migratory.\r\n\r\nFarmers are prone to look upon woodpeckers with suspicion. When the birds\r\nare seen scrambling over fruit trees and pecking holes in the bark, it\r\nis concluded that they must be doing harm. Careful observers, however,\r\nhave noticed that, excepting a single species, these birds rarely leave\r\nany conspicuous mark on a healthy tree, except when it is affected by\r\nwood-boring larvæ, which are accurately located, dislodged, and devoured\r\nby the woodpecker.\r\n\r\nTwo of the best-known woodpeckers, the hairy woodpecker[55] (fig.\r\n20) and the downy woodpecker,[56] including their races, range over\r\nthe greater part of the United States. They differ chiefly in size,\r\ntheir colors being practically the same. The males, like those of\r\nmany other woodpeckers, are distinguished by a scarlet patch on the\r\nhead. An examination of many stomachs of these two species shows that\r\nfrom two-thirds to three-fourths of the food consists of insects,\r\nchiefly noxious kinds. Wood-boring beetles, both adults and larvæ, are\r\nconspicuous, and with them are associated many caterpillars, mostly\r\nspecies that burrow into trees. Next in importance are the ants that\r\nlive in decaying wood, all of which are sought by woodpeckers and eaten\r\nin great quantities. Many ants are particularly harmful to timber, for\r\nif they find a small spot of decay in the vacant burrow of a wood borer,\r\nthey enlarge the hole, and, as their colony is always on the increase,\r\ncontinue to eat away the wood until the whole trunk is honeycombed.\r\nMoreover, they are not accessible to birds generally, and could pursue\r\ntheir career of destruction unmolested were it not that the woodpeckers,\r\nwith beaks and tongues especially fitted for such work, dig out and\r\ndevour them. It is thus evident that woodpeckers are great conservators\r\nof forests. To them more than to any other agency we owe the preservation\r\nof timber from hordes of destructive insects.\r\n\r\n[55] _Dryobates villosus_.\r\n\r\n[56] _Dryobates pubecens_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Flicker. Length, about 12½ inches.]\r\n\r\nOne of the larger woodpeckers familiar to everyone is the flicker, or\r\ngolden-winged woodpecker[57] (fig. 21), which is generally distributed\r\nthroughout the United States from the Atlantic coast to the Rocky\r\nMountains. There it is replaced by the red-shafted flicker,[58] which\r\nextends westward to the Pacific. The two species are as nearly identical\r\nin food habits as their respective environments will allow. The flickers,\r\nwhile genuine woodpeckers, differ somewhat in habits from the rest of\r\nthe family, and are frequently seen searching for food upon the ground.\r\nLike the downy and hairy woodpeckers, they feed upon wood-boring grubs\r\nand ants, but the number of ants eaten is much greater than that eaten\r\nby the other two species. Of the flickers' stomachs examined, three were\r\ncompletely filled with ants. Two of these contained more than 3,000\r\nindividuals each, while the third contained fully 5,000. These ants\r\nbelong to species which live in the ground. It is these insects for\r\nwhich the flicker searches when it runs about in the grass, although\r\nsome grasshoppers also are then taken. The flicker's habit of pecking\r\nholes in buildings sometimes greatly annoys its human friends, and it\r\nis particularly noticeable in the California species. Observation has\r\nshown that the object of the work is to obtain shelter for the winter.\r\nIn the East most of the flickers are migratory, and only a few remain\r\nNorth where shelter is necessary. These generally find a safe retreat\r\nin the hollow tree In which they nested. In California, however, where\r\nthe birds do not migrate, trees are not so abundant as in the East, and\r\nconsequently buildings are brought into requisition, and in them holes\r\nare drilled, usually under the eaves, where snug nights' lodgings are\r\nfound. Often a dozen holes may be seen in one building. Barns or other\r\noutbuildings are usually selected, though churches sometimes have been\r\nused.\r\n\r\n[57] _Colaptes auratus_.\r\n\r\n[58] _Colaptes cafer collaris_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Red-headed woodpecker. Length, about 9½\r\ninches.]\r\n\r\nThe red-headed woodpecker[59] (fig. 22) is well known east of the Rocky\r\nMountains, but Is rather rare in New England. Unlike some of the other\r\nspecies, it prefers fence posts and telegraph poles to trees as a\r\nforaging ground. Its food therefore naturally differs from that of the\r\npreceding species, and consists largely of adult beetles and wasps which\r\nit frequently captures on the wing after the fashion of flycatchers.\r\nGrasshoppers also form an important part of the food. Among the beetles\r\nare a number of predacious ground species and some tiger beetles, which\r\nare useful insects. The red-head has been accused of robbing nests of\r\nother birds, and of pecking out the brains of young birds and poultry;\r\nbut as the stomachs showed little evidence to substantiate this charge,\r\nthe habit probably is exceptional.\r\n\r\n[59] _Melanerpes erythrocephalus_.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable food of woodpeckers is varied, but consists largely of\r\nsmall fruits and berries. The downy and hairy woodpeckers eat such\r\nfruits as dogwood and Virginia creeper and seeds of poison ivy, sumac,\r\nand a few other shrubs. The flicker also eats a great many small fruits\r\nand the seeds of a considerable number of shrubs and weeds. None of\r\nthe three species is much given to eating cultivated fruits or crops.\r\nThe red-head has been accused of eating the larger kinds of fruit, as\r\napples, and also of taking considerable corn. Stomach examinations show\r\nthat to some extent these charges are substantiated, but that the habit\r\nis not prevalent enough to cause much damage. The bird is fond of mast,\r\nespecially beechnuts, and when these nuts are plentiful it remains north\r\nall winter.\r\n\r\nWoodpeckers apparently are the only agents which can successfully cope\r\nwith certain insect enemies of the forest, and, to some extent, with\r\nthose of fruit trees also. For this reason, if for no other, they should\r\nbe protected in every possible way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CUCKOOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo species of cuckoos are common In the United States east of the Great\r\nPlains, the yellow-billed cuckoo[60] (fig. 23) and the black-billed\r\ncuckoo,[61] and in the West a relative of the yellow-bill, the California\r\ncuckoo,[62] ranges from Colorado and Texas to the Pacific coast. While\r\nthe two species are quite distinct, the food habits of the yellow-bill\r\nand the black-bill do not greatly differ and their economic status is\r\npractically the same.\r\n\r\n[60] _Coccyzus americanus_.\r\n\r\n[61] _Coccyzus erythyropthalmus_.\r\n\r\n[62] _Coccyzus americanus occidentalis_.\r\n\r\nExamination of 155 stomachs has shown that these species are much given\r\nto eating caterpillars, and, unlike most birds, do not reject those\r\ncovered with hair. In fact, cuckoos eat so many hairy caterpillars that\r\nthe hairs pierce the inner lining of the stomach and remain there, and\r\noften when the stomach is opened it appears to be lined with a thin\r\ncoating of fur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Yellow-billed cuckoo. Length, about 12 inches.]\r\n\r\nAn examination of the stomachs of 46 black-billed cuckoos, taken during\r\nthe summer months, showed the remains of 906 caterpillars, 44 beetles,\r\n96 grasshoppers, 100 sawflies, 30 stinkbugs, and 15 spiders. In all\r\nprobability more individuals than these were represented, but their\r\nremains were too badly broken for recognition. Most of the caterpillars\r\nwere hairy, and many of them belong to a genus that lives in colonies and\r\nfeeds on the leaves of trees, including the apple tree. One stomach was\r\nfilled with larvæ of a caterpillar belonging to the same genus as the\r\ntent caterpillar, and possibly to that species. Other larvæ were those\r\nof large moths, for which the bird seems to have a special fondness. The\r\nbeetles were for the most part click beetles and weevils, as well as a\r\nfew May beetles. The sawflies were contained in two stomachs, one of\r\nwhich held no less than 60 in the larval stage.\r\n\r\nOf the yellow-billed cuckoo, 109 stomachs (collected from May to October)\r\nwere examined. They contained 1,865 caterpillars, 93 beetles, 242\r\ngrasshoppers, 37 sawflies, 69 bugs, 6 flies, and 86 spiders. As in the\r\ncase of the black-billed cuckoo, most of the caterpillars belonged to\r\nhairy species and many of them were of large size. One stomach contained\r\n250 American tent caterpillars; another 217 fall webworms. The beetles\r\nwere distributed among several families, all more or less harmful to\r\nagriculture. In the same stomach which contained the tent caterpillars\r\nwere 2 Colorado potato beetles; in another were 3 goldsmith beetles, and\r\nremains of several other large beetles. Besides the ordinary grasshoppers\r\nwere several katydids and tree crickets. The sawflies were in the larval\r\nstage, in which they resemble caterpillars so closely that they are\r\ncommonly called false caterpillars by entomologists. The bugs consisted\r\nof stinkbugs and cicadas, or dog-day harvest flies, with the single\r\nexception of one wheel bug, which was the only useful insect eaten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOBWHITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo bird is better known to country residents than the bobwhite[63] (see\r\nillustration on title-page). The bird's cheery calls the year round form\r\npart of the most pleasant associations of country life, and its neat form\r\nand harmonious coloration, and especially its confiding habits, make it a\r\ngeneral favorite.\r\n\r\n[63] _Colinus virginianus._\r\n\r\nAny bushy fence row serves as a retreat for its nest, or for winter\r\nshelter, and weed-covered fields are its favorite feeding places. Weed\r\nseeds form more than half the total food and include those of all\r\nthe worst weed pests of the farm. Among them may be mentioned crab,\r\ncockspur, witch, and foxtail grasses, sheep sorrel, smartweed, bindweed,\r\nlamb's-quarters, pigweeds, corn cockle, chickweed, charlock, partridge\r\npea, beggar lice, nail grass, rib grass, ragweed, and Spanish needles.\r\n\r\nAcorns, beechnuts, chestnuts, and pine seeds make up about 2.5 per cent\r\nof the food, and wild fruit about 10 per cent The fruits include berries\r\nof palmetto, smilax, wax myrtle, mulberry, sassafras, blackberries and\r\nraspberries, rose haws, cherry, sumac, grapes, sour gum, blueberries,\r\nhoneysuckle, partridgeberry, and a number of others. The bobwhite feeds\r\nto a slight extent upon buds and leaves, including those of yellow and\r\nred sorrel, cinquefoil, and clover.\r\n\r\nGrain forms scarcely more than a sixth of the food, and most of it is\r\ntaken during winter and early spring when nothing but waste grain is\r\navailable The habit of gleaning this after the harvest is beneficial\r\nto the farm, for volunteer grain is not desirable, especially where it\r\nserves to maintain certain insect and fungus pests. Although most of the\r\ngrain and seed crops grown upon the farm are represented in bobwhite's\r\ndietary, no significant damage can be attributed to the bird.\r\n\r\nAnimal food, chiefly insects, composed nearly a sixth of the bird's\r\nsubsistence. From June to August, inclusive, when insects are most\r\nnumerous, their proportion in the food is about 36 per cent. The variety\r\nof insect food is great and includes a number of the most destructive\r\nagricultural pests. Among them may be mentioned the Colorado potato\r\nbeetle, 12-spotted cucumber beetle, bean leaf beetle, squash ladybird,\r\nwire-worms. May beetles, corn billbugs, clover-leaf weevil, army worm,\r\nboilworm, cutworms, and chinch bug.\r\n\r\nThe food habits of the bobwhite undoubtedly are beneficial and the bird\r\nshould be maintained in numbers on every farm. This is not to say that\r\nall shooting should be prohibited, for the bird is very prolific. But its\r\nnumbers should not be reduced below what the available nesting sites and\r\nrange will support. On the other hand the policy of absolute protection\r\nrecently adopted by one of the States is not called for by strictly\r\neconomic considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n       ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\r\n                 WHEN THIS PUBLICATION WAS LAST PRINTED\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_            Henry A.
