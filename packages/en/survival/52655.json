First, a series of\r\nindexes to the specimens in the great divisions into which the Museum\r\nis arranged; secondly, a series of memoirs upon the orders and classes\r\nof animals concerning which new knowledge is given by fossils in the\r\nMuseum; and, thirdly, memoirs descriptive of those species contained\r\nin the arranged collections which are at present unknown in scientific\r\nwritings.\r\n\r\nFor the convenience of students the Catalogue is made in parts. The\r\nSyndics of the University Press printed last autumn as an example of\r\nthe \"Indexes to the Museum,\" an Index to the Pterodactyles, Birds,\r\nand Reptiles from the Secondary Strata. And this memoir is an example\r\nof the second kind of Catalogue, which explains the structures of the\r\nPterodactyles of the Cambridge Greensand. In its progress questions\r\nhave arisen which necessitated an examination both of the method, of\r\nresearch in comparative anatomy and of its results in classification.\r\nAnd in so far as the views here advanced differ from those commonly\r\ntaught, the discrepancy is due to the writer's imperfect faith in the\r\nresults of the inductive method of research, as commonly used by modern\r\nwriters on Palæontology. It has not been consistent with the plan of\r\nthis little work to do more than scatter through it a few hints upon\r\nmethod, a subject which will more fitly be discussed with a part of the\r\nCatalogue which forms a synopsis of the osteology of the fossil animals\r\nusually named Reptiles. The views here urged have however but little\r\nof novelty. The name Ornithosauria was proposed by the distinguished\r\nnaturalist Prince Charles Bonaparte in 1838. The group as an order was\r\nrecognized by Von Meyer in 1830. The affinities of the brain appear\r\nto have been detected by Oken, and the bird-like character of the\r\nrespiratory system was expounded by Von Meyer. And most of whatever\r\nthis memoir contains has been already thought or discovered by the\r\nGerman philosophers, who have had the Pterodactyles as fossils of their\r\nfatherland, though my own conclusions were arrived at separately and\r\nfrom different materials.\r\n\r\nThe oldest Ornithosaurians are from the Muschelkalk of Germany.\r\nIn England the oldest are from the Lias,--several species of\r\nDimorphodon--a genus in some respects nearly resembling the\r\nPterosaurians of the Cambridge Upper Greensand. In the Oolite of\r\nStonesfield are several species of Rhamphorhynchus or a similar genus.\r\nThe great Pælolithic period from the Oxford Clay to the Kimeridge\r\nClay, has yielded in its several divisions small Pterodactyles of\r\nnew species. And the Psammolithic period from the Portland Sand to\r\nthe Lower Greensand has afforded many excellent remains both of true\r\nPterosaurians in the Purbeck, Wealden, and Potton Sands, and of animals\r\nwhich indicate a new order of Ornithosauria having affinities with\r\nVon Meyer's thick footed saurians, the Dinosauria. In the Cretaceous\r\nseries, Galt, Upper Greensand, and Chalk all have representatives\r\nof the Pterosauria; but no English stratum has hitherto yielded\r\nso many as the Cambridge Upper Greensand. From this formation the\r\ncollection accumulated during Prof. Sedgwick's long professoriate is\r\nunequalled; though, excepting a few fine bones from the Chalk and\r\nthe Purbeck Limestone, the Woodwardian Museum is as yet deficient in\r\nOrnithosaurians from the other Secondary Rocks. Until descriptions\r\nof these animals shall have been published a classification of the\r\nOrnithosauria must necessarily be provisional. And it cannot be\r\nexpected that descriptions of the structure of Cretaceous Pterosaurians\r\nhere given will hold good for all the Ornithosaurian sub-class.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have gratefully to express my thanks to the many friends,\r\nEnglish and German, who have aided me with specimens and with their\r\nwritings; to the chiefs and officers of the English museums, especially\r\nProf. Owen, Prof Humphry, Prof Newton, Prof Phillips, Prof Flower, and\r\nProf. Huxley; to the officers of the University Library, especially\r\nMr Bradshaw, and Mr Crotch, for aid in consulting books; but chiefly\r\nto Prof Sedgwick, who while employing me as his paid Assistant to\r\naid him in his Museum work, has generously encouraged me to carry on\r\nfor several years, without restraint and as part of my daily labour,\r\nan investigation of which this treatise is the first fruit. Prof.\r\nSedgwick has placed at my disposal an ample number of copies for\r\ndistribution among those who take an interest in the Museum; and\r\nespecially among those who have contributed to the Ornithosaurian\r\ncollections, and aided me in my work.\r\n\r\n  _January 3, 1870._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         _Page_\r\n  Introduction

          TO THE\r\n\r\n\r\n                OSTEOLOGY OF THE ORNITHOSAURIA FROM THE\r\n                      CAMBRIDGE UPPER GREENSAND.\r\n\r\n                          --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cambridge Upper Greensand has yielded to collectors bones which\r\nillustrate nearly every part of the skeleton of the animals that are\r\ncommonly named Pterodactyles. Large collections have been acquired\r\nfor the Woodwardian Museum. A series of more than 500 bones have\r\nbeen arranged to exemplify the osteology and organization of the\r\nOrnithosauria in the area when the Cambridge Greensand was deposited.\r\nAnd this memoir is written to explain briefly some of the structures\r\nof the soft and hard parts of those animals which are exhibited or\r\ndemonstrated by these relics. Another collection of nearly 400 bones\r\nhas been arranged, which displays in association, as they were found\r\nentombed in the old Greensand sea-bed, the remains of the skeletons of\r\nthirty-three animals of the Pterodactyle kind. The whole of the remains\r\nfrom this formation hitherto gathered cannot be computed to have\r\npertained to fewer than 150 individuals, which indicate a new sub-class\r\nof animals, two new genera and at least twenty-five new species.\r\n\r\nThe bones were mostly of a paper or card-like thinness, and were\r\noriginally hollow like the thin bones of birds. In the jaws of other\r\nanimals, and in the sea, they were easily fractured, so that proximal\r\nends and distal ends and shafts and split bones abound, while perfect\r\nbones are almost unknown. Even those bones like the carpals, which\r\nalmost retain their entirety, invariably show indications of having\r\nbeen rolled on the sea-shore among the nodules of phosphate of lime\r\nwith which they now occur, in their angular margins being rounded, and\r\nin the removal of slender processes. The rock in which these fossils\r\nare found is a thin bed of chalky marl which is heavily charged with\r\ndark-green grains of Glauconite, and is quarried largely, and entirely\r\ndug away to be deprived of the dark-brown nodules of phosphate of lime\r\nwith which it is stored. In digging and in the subsequent washing, the\r\nworkmen, stimulated by an ample reward, pick out the fossils as they\r\nare discovered. They are separated easily from the matrix of investing\r\nmarl, so that every aspect of each bone is seen, except for the\r\noccasionally adherent oysters and the masses of phosphate of lime, with\r\nwhich material the bones are also filled. Hence these remains afford\r\nfacilities for the study of the _joints_ such as no other specimens\r\nhave presented; and from their large size and comparatively great\r\nnumbers, render easy the labour of the student who seeks to contrast\r\nthem with the bones of other animals.\r\n\r\nThe osteological collection has been formed without regard to species\r\nor genera, and arranged to exhibit the structure and organization of\r\nthe tribe of animals. So far as possible each bone, as humerus, femur,\r\n&c., has its variations of structures and form contrasted on a single\r\ntablet. The series comprises the following bones:\r\n\r\n  Fore-part of sternum. Coracoid (perfect). Scapula (nearly perfect).\r\n  Humerus (perfect). ?Radius (proximal end). Radius (distal end). ?Ulna\r\n  (proximal end). Ulna (distal end). Proximal carpal. Distal carpal.\r\n  Lateral carpal. Wing-metacarpal (proximal and distal ends). First\r\n  phalange (proximal and distal ends). Second phalange (proximal end).\r\n  Metacarpal or metatarsal (distal end). Claw phalange. Os innominatum\r\n  (parts of ilium, ischium, and pubis). Femur (perfect). ?Tibia\r\n  (proximal end). Atlas and axis. Cervical vertebræ. Dorsal vertebræ.\r\n  Sacrum and sacral vertebræ. Caudal vertebræ. Lower jaw (dentary and\r\n  articular ends). Premaxillary bones, &c. Teeth. Quadrate bone (distal\r\n  end with quadrato-jugal). Ethmoid with basi-sphenoid. Occipital and\r\n  parietal segments of skulls. Basi-occipital and basi-temporal. Cast\r\n  of brain-cavity.\r\n\r\nThey are exhibited in Compartments _a_, _b_, _c_ of the Table-case of\r\nCabinet =J=. The letter =F= in a circle is placed against figured\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory.\r\n\r\nThe Cambridge Pterodactyles first attain prominence in scientific\r\nliterature in the year 1859. Professor Owen had figured (plate 32, fig.\r\n6-8) fragments of bones in the Palæontographical Society's Monograph\r\nfor 1851; the distal end of a large ulna (fig. 6); the shaft of a\r\nphalange of the wing-finger, probably the first (fig. 7); and the upper\r\nportion of the shaft of a small humerus showing part of the radial\r\ncrest (fig. 8). Inadvertently the last specimen was referred to the\r\nLower Greensand. But although fragments of humerus of Pterodactyle and\r\nvertebræ of Pterodactyloid animals have in the last few years been\r\ngathered from the Potton Sands, those deposits were believed to be\r\nbarren of fossils when Prof. Owen wrote; and all the Pterodactyles yet\r\nmade known from near Cambridge were collected from the Cambridge Upper\r\nGreensand.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest successful collectors were Mr James Carter, the\r\nRev. H. G. Day, St John's Coll.; Prof. G. D. Liveing, St John's Coll.;\r\nthe Rev. T. G. Bonney, St John's Coll.; and Mr Lucas Barrett, Trin.\r\nColl.; and the Rev. Prof. Sedgwick, Trin. Coll., on behalf of the\r\nWoodwardian Museum. Mr Day and Mr Bonney both presented every specimen\r\nfrom their cabinets which could enrich the University collection. And\r\nin the last ten years the Woodwardian Museum has acquired, through the\r\nskillful collecting of the Messrs Farren, the present materials. The\r\nassociated sets of bones were formed by William and Robert Farren,\r\nwho, obtaining the specimens from day to day as they were discovered,\r\nwere enabled to put together such parts of the skeleton as remained\r\ntogether on the sea-bottom. These collections will hereafter be used\r\nfor the elucidation of species. They are the only materials which can\r\ngive the proportions of the Cambridge Ornithosaurians, and the contrast\r\nof aspect which distinguished the living animals from those from other\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nThe other collections of these fossils are those of Mr William Reed\r\nand Mr J. F. Walker at York, the Museum of Practical Geology, and the\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\nThe Woodwardian specimens as collected were placed in the hands of\r\nProf. Owen, and were first made known in the Professor's lectures on\r\nreptiles and birds delivered at the Museum of Practical Geology in\r\n1858. In that year Prof. Owen communicated to the British Association\r\nfor the Advancement of Science, and printed in their Report, the matter\r\nof the memoir which was published with plates by the Palæontographical\r\nSociety in 1859. In this latter year Prof. Owen communicated to the\r\nRoyal Society an account of the vertebral column of Pterodactyles. In\r\n1859 Prof. Owen also produced a classification of recent and fossil\r\nreptiles at the meeting of the British Association, in which the\r\norder Pterosauria appears with new characters--such as the pneumatic\r\nstructure of most of the bones--drawn from Cambridge specimens. In\r\n1860 Prof. Owen produced another memoir on Pterodactyles, which was\r\npublished by the Palæontographical Society. A brief account of the\r\ntribe appeared about the same time in the Professor's _Palæontology_.\r\n\r\nIn these writings are descriptions of the various parts of the\r\nvertebral column. Their procœlian centra are described, and the\r\npneumatic foramina are noticed and supposed to have communicated\r\nwith air-cells. They are compared with birds, and distinguished from\r\nbirds; but although the order is classed with reptiles no contrast with\r\nreptiles is made. Other bones described are a basi-occipital, and a\r\ndoubtful bone, then thought to be a frontal, but which is more like the\r\nneural region of the sacrum.\r\n\r\nThe sternum is compared with the sternum of the birds Apteryx and\r\nAptenodytes, is stated to be formed, in the main, on the Ornithic type,\r\nand to possess distinct synovial articular cavities for the coracoids\r\nsuch as only occur in birds. The inter-coracoid process of the sternum\r\nis compared with that of Bats, Birds, and Crocodiles.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of the framework of the wings is said to be much\r\nmore bird-like than bat-like, the anchylosed scapula and coracoid\r\nbeing remarkably similar to those of a bird of flight. The coracoid\r\nis shorter and straighter in birds than in Pterodactyles, but no\r\ncomparisons are made with reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe humerus is known only by the proximal end. It is said to conform\r\nat its proximal end more with the Crocodilian than with the Avian\r\ntype, but to have the radial crest much more developed than in either\r\nCrocodile or Bird. The bone is, however, chiefly compared with\r\nbirds, and is figured between corresponding bones of a Vulture and a\r\nCrocodile. The pneumatic texture is said to be as well marked as in any\r\nbird of flight.\r\n\r\nOf the carpus it is said, the Pterodactyle, in the complete separation\r\nof the metacarpus from the antibrachium by two successive carpals\r\nanswering to the two rows, adheres more closely to the reptilian type\r\nthan to that of birds. But the row which was regarded as proximal is\r\nthe distal row, while the supposed distal row is proximal.\r\n\r\nThe claw-phalange and distal end of the wing-metacarpal, the mandible,\r\nteeth, and jaw are the other bones described, but their comparative\r\nosteology is not discussed. In the Professor's account of a fragment of\r\na jaw it is said, \"The evidence of the large and obviously pneumatic\r\nvacuities now filled with matrix, and the demonstrable thin layer of\r\ncompact bone forming their outer wall, permit no reasonable doubt\r\nas to the Pterosaurian nature of this fossil. All other parts of\r\nthe flying reptile being in proportion, it must have appeared with\r\noutstretched pinions like the soaring Roc of Arabian romance, but with\r\nthe demoniacal features of the leathern wings with crooked claws, and\r\nof the gaping mouth with threatening teeth, superinduced.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the specimens on which Prof. Owen had founded the foregoing views\r\nof the osteology and classification of these animals were at length\r\nreturned to the Woodwardian Museum, it became a duty of the present\r\nwriter to arrange and name them. And in a Memoir on Pterodactyles which\r\nwas communicated to the Cambridge Philosophical Society and read March\r\n7 and May 2 and 16, 1864, a position was claimed for them, distinct\r\nfrom reptiles, as a separate sub-class of Sauropsida, nearly related to\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nIn September of the same year a communication was made to the British\r\nAssociation \"On the Pterodactyle as evidence of a new sub-class of\r\nvertebrata (Sauromia),\" with enlarged drawings of the skull and some\r\nof the other bones, in which the conclusions arrived at were that,\r\nexcepting the teeth, there is little in such parts of the head as are\r\npreserved to distinguish the Cambridge Pterodactyles from birds; and\r\nthat the remainder of the skeleton gives a general support to the\r\ninference from the skull.\r\n\r\nPapers were communicated to the Cambridge Philosophical Society\r\non February 17, 1868, on indications of Mammalian affinities in\r\nPterodactyles in the pelvis and femur, and February 22, 1869, on the\r\nbird-like characters of the brain and metatarsus in the Pterodactyls\r\nfrom the Cambridge Greensand. The other references to Cambridge\r\nspecimens are in a paper \"On the literature of English Pterodactyles\"\r\nin the _Annals and Magazine of Natural History_ for Feb. 1865, and in\r\n\"An epitome of the evidence that Pterodactyles are not reptiles, but\r\na new sub-class of vertebrate animals allied to birds,\" in the same\r\nmagazine for May, 1866.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Prof. Owen's views have somewhat changed. In the first\r\nvolume of the _Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Vertebrata_\r\n(1866), the Pterosauria are classed as the highest group of reptiles,\r\nand take rank above the Dinosauria. In the second volume of that work\r\n(1866), occurs the following passage:\r\n\r\n\"Derivatively the class of birds is most closely connected with the\r\nPterosaurian order of cold-blooded air-breathers. In equivalency it is\r\ncomparable rather with such a group than with the Reptilia in totality,\r\nor with the Mammalia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganization.\r\n\r\nNearly every writer on Pterodactyles, who has expressed any opinion\r\nat all, has formed an estimate of his own of their organization. They\r\nhave been assigned to almost all possible positions in the vertebrate\r\nprovince, by great anatomists who all had before them very similar\r\nmaterials. An account of these views is given by von Meyer in his\r\nmonograph of the Pterodactyles of the Lithographic Slate. It will not\r\nbe necessary to discuss these conclusions here, for the materials\r\nfrom the Lithographic Slate and those from the Cambridge Greensand\r\nare so different that no light would be thrown on the organization of\r\nthe animals by an exposition of any fallacious inferences from German\r\nspecimens. In England they are classed with Reptilia, chiefly through\r\nthe influence of the discourse upon them given by Baron Cuvier in his\r\n_Ossemens Fossiles_[A]. It therefore may conduce to a clear view of\r\nthe subject to quote in Cuvier's words the passages in that memoir\r\nwhich have been supposed to establish their position among reptiles. He\r\nsays,--\"Ayant encore porté mon attention sur le petit os cylindrique\r\nmarqué _g_ (i.e. os quadratum) qui va du crâne à l'articulation des\r\nmâchoires, je me crus muni de tout ce qui étoit nécessaire pour classer\r\nostéologiquement notre animal parmi les reptiles.\" The exact relations\r\nof the quadrate bone are not seen in either Cuvier's or Goldfuss' or\r\nvon Meyer's figures of this Pterodactyle, the P. longirostris; but in\r\nvon Meyer's figures of P. crassirostris, P. longicollum, and P. Kochi\r\nit appears to be a free bone articulated to the squamosal and petrosal\r\nregion of the skull and with the lower jaw. This is not the case with\r\neither Chelonians or Crocodiles, which have the quadrate bone firmly\r\npacked in the skull; nor is it paralleled even among those lizards\r\nand serpents which have the bone as free; while, on the contrary, it\r\nis characteristic of the whole class of birds. The form of the bone\r\nis not more Lacertian than Avian, while its direct attachment to the\r\nbone of the brain-case finds no parallel among lizards, but is exactly\r\nparalleled in all birds.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Tome V. Part a, pp. 358, 383. Edition, 1814.]\r\n\r\nCuvier then goes on to say, \"Ce n'étoit pas non plus un oiseau,\r\nquoiqu'il eût été rapporté aux oiseaux palmipèdes par un grand\r\nnaturaliste[B].\" Which position he supports as follows:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Blumenbach.]\r\n\r\n(1) \"Un oiseau auroit des côtes plus larges, et munies chacune d'une\r\napophyse récurrente[C]; son metatarse n'auroit formé qu'un seul os,\r\net n'auroit pas été composé d'autanut d'os qu'il a de doigts.\" These,\r\nthough they may not be characters which are those of birds, are\r\ncertainly not eminently reptilian. The elongated form of the tarsals\r\nin birds is peculiar, but quite functional, as may be seen among the\r\nPenguins, where, when the so-called tarso-metatarsal bone is no longer\r\nerect, it becomes much shorter, and is nearly separated into three\r\ndistinct bones. The cretaceous Pterodactyles appear to have this bone\r\nexactly like that of birds.\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: This shown in other specimens since figured, and in the\r\nspecimen from Stonesfield in the Oxford Museum.]\r\n\r\n(2) \"Son aile n'auroit eu que trois divisions après l'avantbras, et non\r\npas cinq comme celle-ce.\" This is a difference, but a difference of\r\ndetail only, and not a reptilian character. The creatures have wings;\r\nand no reptile known, from recent or fossil specimens, has wings. The\r\ngeneral plan of the wing, though very unlike, approximates to that of\r\na bird. Most birds have two phalanges in the long finger, though some\r\nhave three. One Pterodactyle is described as having only two phalanges\r\nin the wing-finger, while most of the German specimens appear to have\r\nfour phalanges. In birds the longest finger appears to be the middle\r\none, while in Pterodactyles it is the innermost one.\r\n\r\n(3) \"Son bassin auroit eu une toute autre étendue et sa queue\r\nosseuse un toute autre forme; elle seroit élargie, et non pas grêle\r\net conique.\" The pelvis of Pterodactyle is not reptilian, and no\r\nliving reptile has a pelvis like it. It is not unlike the pelvis of\r\na Monotreme, but the ilium is more Avian. It resembles the pelvis\r\nof Dicynodon. And the discovery of a long-tailed bird-like the\r\nArchæopteryx shows that the tail is like that of old birds, even if\r\nit also presents some analogy in form to that of certain reptiles and\r\nmammals.\r\n\r\n(4) \"Il n'y auroit pas eu de dents au bec; les dents des _harles_ ne\r\ntiennent qu'à l'enveloppe cornée, et non à la charpente osseuse.\" This\r\nis not a reptilian character. Among reptiles some tribes have teeth,\r\nothers want them; and among mammals some animals are without teeth,\r\nthough they are so characteristic of the class. It is an anomaly that\r\nbirds should all be toothless. And so, without citing the supposed\r\nteeth of _Archæopteryx_, it may be affirmed that it would be no more\r\nremarkable for some birds to have teeth than it is for some mammals and\r\nreptiles to be without them.\r\n\r\n(5) \"Les vertèbres du cou auroient été plus nombreuses. Aucun\r\noiseau n'en a moins de neuf; les palmipèdes, en particulier, en ont\r\ndepuis douze jusqu'à vingt-trois, et l'on n'en voit ici que six ou\r\ntout au plus sept.\" This is a variation of detail such as, had it\r\noccurred among birds, would hardly have been deemed evidence of their\r\naffinities. When the variation of the neck-vertebræ ranges from 23 to\r\n9, the further reduction of the number to 7 becomes insignificant, and\r\ndoes not show that the animal was a reptile.\r\n\r\n(6) \"Au contraire, les vertèbres du dos l'auroient été beau-coup moins.\r\nIl semble qu'il y en ait plus de vingt, et les oiseaux en ont de sept\r\nà dix, ou tout au plus onze.\" This modification is obviously the\r\nresult of smaller development of the pelvic bones from front to back,\r\nand hence of the small number of vertebræ in the sacrum. It does not\r\nsupport the reference of Pterodactyles to the class of reptiles.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the teeth, it is said, \"Elles sont toutes simples,\r\nconiques, et à peu près semblables entre elles comme dans les\r\ncrocodiles, les monitors, et d'autres lézards.\" The teeth of\r\nPterodactyles are (in the skull) for the most part in the premaxillary\r\nbones, in which it is so characteristic for the teeth of animals to, be\r\nmerely conical and simple. Therefore it would have been difficult to\r\nimagine the teeth to have been anything but what they are, whatever the\r\naffinities of the Pterodactyle might be.\r\n\r\nIt is remarked, \"La longueur du cou est proportionée à celle de la\r\ntéte. On y voit cinq vertèbres grandes et prismatiques comme celles des\r\noiseaux à long cou, et une plus petite se montre à chaque extrémité.\"\r\nThis adds nothing to the evidence for its reptilian character.\r\n\r\n\"Ce qui est le plus fait pour étonner, c'est que cette longue téte\r\net ce long cou soient portés sur un si petit corps; les oiseaux\r\nseuls offrent de semblable proportions, et sans doute c'est, avec la\r\nlongueur du grand doigt, ce qui avoit determiné quelques naturalistes\r\nà rapporter notre animal à cette classe.\" Nor is this evidence that\r\nthe animal was a reptile. And in many minor matters Cuvier is careful\r\nto show how their modifications resemble those of birds; and when\r\nthis is not so, birds are the only animals from which he finds them\r\nvarying. And the few suggestions which are thrown out respecting their\r\naffinities with lizards are upon points which are also common to birds.\r\n\r\nThus what Cuvier did was to distinguish these animals from birds, and\r\nincidentally to show that their organization was a modification of\r\nthat of the Avian class. And the legitimate inference would have been\r\nthat their systematic place was near the birds, and not that they were\r\nreptiles.\r\n\r\nBut in Germany Cuvier's views on Pterodactyles have by no means been\r\nsubmissively received; and great anatomists, since he wrote, have\r\npropounded and defended views as various as those of the anatomists\r\nwho preceded him, and with no less confidence in the results of their\r\nscience. In the brief space at my command it would be impossible to\r\ndo justice to the works of this array of philosophers, and therefore\r\nI present in a somewhat condensed version the epitome of their\r\nconclusions given by Hermann von Meyer in his _Reptilien aus dem\r\nLithographischen Schiefer der Jura_. They form a commentary on the\r\ncasts of Solenhofen Pterodactyles contained in the Woodwardian Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nSömmerring\r\n\r\nregarded the Pterodactyle as an unknown kind of bat, and thought that\r\nCuvier was misled by Collini's imperfect description. He believed that\r\nhe found in them different kinds of teeth as in mammals; and regarded\r\nthem as differing from bats chiefly in having larger eye-holes, a\r\nlonger neck, four fingers and four toes, a longer metatarsus, and in\r\nhaving but one elongated finger; and found the closest analogue of the\r\nfingers in Pteropus marginatus of Bengal. And although inclined to\r\nplace the Pterodactyle between Pteropus and Galeopithecus, he suspects\r\nfrom the bird-like characters of the head and feet that its true place\r\nis intermediate between mammals and birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nOken[D].\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: _Isis_, 1818, p. 551.]\r\n\r\nOken reasoned carefully so far as his materials went. He dwells much\r\non the analogy of the wing to that of a bat, and seems to suspect that\r\nthe marsupial bones would hereafter be found; and, excepting the head,\r\nfinds that the other parts of the skeleton have their corresponding\r\nbones among mammals.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, when he saw the specimens at Munich, he was so much struck\r\nat finding the quadrate bone of Lacertian form, though Sömmerring\r\ncould not detect it even with a microscope, that he is shaken in his\r\nmammalian faith, and inclines to consider the animal a reptile.\r\n\r\n\r\nWagler[E].\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: _System der Amphibien_, 1830, p. 75.]\r\n\r\nWagler was impressed with the resemblance of the jaws and the rounded\r\nback part of the skull to those of Dolphins, and so far as the head\r\nwent conceives it to have had nothing in common with Lizards. He\r\nrecognizes mammalian characters in the pelvis and sternum, and fails,\r\nlike Sömmerring, to detect a quadrate bone, and finds the sum of the\r\ncharacters like those of other extinct animals, such as Ichthyosaurus\r\nand Plesiosaurus, suggesting for it a position between mammals and\r\nbirds. He supposed it unable to fly, that it never left the water,\r\nbut swam about on the surface like a swan, and sought its food on\r\nthe sea-bottom. He imagined the long arms to have been used after\r\nthe fashion of turtles and penguins to row the body along; while to\r\nthe claws he attributes the function of holding the females in the\r\ngenerative process.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoldfuss[F].\r\n\r\n[Footnote F: _Nova Acta Acad. Leopold._, 1831, Vol. XV. Pt. I. p. 103.]\r\n\r\nsees in Pterodactyle an indication of the course that nature took in\r\nchanging the reptilian organization to that of birds and mammals. The\r\nless important organs, those of motion, assimilate partly to those\r\nof the bird and partly to those of the bats, but always preserve\r\nthe fundament reptile type and reptile number of bones. The skull,\r\nfluctuating in character between the monitor and crocodile, hides its\r\nreptile nature under the outer form of the bird, but retains the teeth.\r\nTo change the skull into a bird's skull it would only be necessary that\r\na few separate elements should be blended together, and that a few\r\npeculiar bones should be removed. The length of the neck, varying only\r\nin a few species, is a deviation from the reptile type, and indicates\r\nan approximation to the structure of 'the bird; but the number of\r\nthe vertebræ remains constant notwithstanding the increased length.\r\nThe fundamental plan of the crocodile may be recognised in all the\r\nimportant parts of the vertebræ. The body of the reptile, to be enabled\r\nto fly, would need a larger breast and a stronger structure of the\r\nfore-limbs. The shoulder-blade of the reptile, with its extremities\r\nforming the glenoid cavity, is necessarily smaller and prolonged\r\nbackward, and altered to resemble that of a bird. The scapula only\r\nformed the back part of the glenoid cavity, but it is thick and strong,\r\nsuggesting an affinity with the bats.\r\n\r\nThe breast-bone, in the form of a shield, is changing into that of a\r\nbird; as are the ribs, which are attached in a peculiar way to the\r\nvertebral column. It is really the strong sternum of the Chameleon,\r\nwith moveable dorsal vertebræ. The whole chest is supported by the\r\npeculiar continuation of the wings of the pubic bones (Schambein).\r\nThe ischiac and pubic bones resemble those of the Chameleon, but the\r\nilium runs a little down, like that of a bird, and is only slightly\r\nconnected with two sacral vertebræ, as in reptiles, prolonging itself\r\na little upward and forward, as in mammals. The wings of the pubic\r\nbones exist in the Turtle and Monitor, but of small extent; they are\r\nalso represented in the mammals by the upward development of the pubic\r\nbones in those families, genera, and species, in which nature has\r\nindicated by variety of shape, or peculiarities of development, or by\r\naffinities with reptiles, quite a new type and capacity for variation\r\nwithin certain limits, which is especially the case with certain\r\nRodents and Opossums, and Monotremes. It would not be astonishing to\r\nfind in Pterodactyles the marsupial bones. And indeed the Pterodactylus\r\ncrassirostris has a small tongue-shaped bone, probably belonging to the\r\npelvis. The less important part of the skeleton, the tail, is formed\r\nprecisely as in mammals, and is identical with that of the bats. Both\r\nthe thigh and shin are mammalian, and only the foot retains the same\r\nnumber of parts as in reptiles.\r\n\r\nThis animal was enabled by means of the pelvic bones and the long\r\nhind-legs to sit like the squirrels.\r\n\r\nWe should regard this position as natural but for the long wing-finger\r\nhanging far down the sides. If it were to creep along it would have\r\nthe same difficulties as a bat, and the length and weight of the\r\nhead, as well as the proportional weakness of the bind limb, make it\r\nimprobable that they progressed by leaping. These animals made use of\r\ntheir claws only to hang on to rocks and trees and to climb up steep\r\ncliffs. They could fly with their wings, and keep themselves aloft in\r\norder to catch insects or sea animals. The wide throat and the weak\r\nand high supports of the jaw-bone make it probable that they only used\r\ntheir teeth to capture their prey and not to mince it. By means of\r\ntheir long neck, which they usually bore curved backward in order to\r\nkeep their balance, they could stretch out their head to their prey\r\nand change their centre of gravity, and so fly in different positions.\r\nThe fundamental type of the Crocodile and Monitor leads us to suspect\r\nthat they had a skin covered with scales. The approximation to the\r\nshape of the Bird makes it probable that they were feathered. And the\r\nwhole outline, similar to that of the Bat, leads to the supposition\r\nthat they were covered with hair, like the Monotremes. Goldfuss thinks\r\nhe has got a clear insight into the covering of the body and the whole\r\ncondition of the wing in examining the Pt. crassirostris. And the soft\r\nstate of the stone near the bones he attributes to the presence of\r\nthe soft parts of the animal; and supposes that on the original folds\r\nof the wing-membrane are to be seen tufts and bunches of curved hair\r\ndirected downward and sideway[G]. And on the principal slab he finds\r\nevidence that the Pterodactyle had a mane on the neck like a horse.\r\nThe tufts on the counter slab have some similarity with the feathers\r\nof the ostrich. Some very tender impressions on both plates still more\r\nresemble feathers. He recognizes the outline and faint diverging rays\r\nof a bird's feather, but never sees a strong quill. The microscope,\r\ninstead of making the image clearer, makes it, on the contrary, vanish,\r\nbecause then the rough parts become prominent. Also on the slab which\r\ncontains the Pterodactylus medius[H], are seen numerous lines and\r\nfibres diverging like a bird's feathers. And on the upper part of the\r\nbelly is the appearance of a scanty texture of hairs and feathers. The\r\nvisible marks of two cylinders of the thickness of a quill, made of\r\nthin substance and filled with limestone, he would regard as quills if\r\nthere were clearer marks of their feathers to be seen. As a note upon\r\nthis von Meyer says, after examining the slabs, that the particles\r\nconsidered by Goldfuss to be hairs and feathers rest upon appearances\r\nnot only to be seen in the vicinity of Pterodactyles, but which occur\r\nupon many other kinds of petrifactions that have nothing in common with\r\nthe Pterodactyle; and that the roughnesses of the slab have nothing to\r\ndo with the folds of the wing or the muscles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: This is represented in Pl. 7, 8 of his memoir, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: Pl. 6, _Nova Afta Acad. Leopold_, Vol. XV. Pt. 1.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWagner[I]\r\n\r\n[Footnote I: _Abhandl. Bayerischen Acad._ 1852, Vol. VI.]\r\n\r\nis so convinced that the Pterodactyles are Amphibians approximating\r\nto the Saurians, that he does not think it necessary to go into\r\nany controversy in the matter; but he acknowledges that their\r\nforms sometimes present peculiarities of bird and mammal. The head\r\nespecially shows a blending of the bird and reptile types. Its outline,\r\nparticularly when seen from above, is that of a long-beaked water-bird.\r\nAnd the long interval between the nose-holes and the tip of the jaw,\r\nand the peculiar fact of a hole between the nose and eye-holes, and\r\nthe want of the continuation of the coronoid of the lower jaw, rather\r\nresemble a water-bird than a Saurian. But the presence and the form\r\nof the teeth show it to be a Saurian; and not only the teeth, but the\r\nconfiguration of the whole back part of the skull, reproduces the type\r\nof the Monitor. The sclerotic circle is a peculiar mark of birds and\r\nsaurians. Very peculiar, however, is the extremely short back part\r\nof the skull; and the articulation of the lower jaw, stretched far\r\nforward and united just under the middle of the eye-hole. The more\r\nor less long neck, which may assume the form of an S, deviates very\r\nmuch from the short stiff neck of reptiles, and is quite bird-like,\r\nthe neck-vertebræ of which those of the Pterodactyle closely resemble\r\nin shape; while their constant number of seven reminds us of mammals\r\nand crocodiles. The neck has the same flexibility as in a bird. The\r\nshort and weak trunk-vertebræ are in such disproportion to the length\r\nand strength of the neck-vertebræ as is never met with even in the\r\nbirds and mammals which have the longest necks. The trunk-vertebræ\r\nare completely separated from each other, and may be divided into\r\ndorsal, lumbar, and sacral vertebræ. The transverse processes of the\r\nback-vertebræ are notched out like those of the crocodile. The tail\r\nis short in most species, and this is a deviation from the type of\r\nthe Saurians, and an approximation to birds and to many mammals. But\r\nthere are some kinds with very long tails, as is the case with mammals\r\nand usually with Saurians. But the vertebræ of these long-tailed\r\nPterodactyles deviate very much from those of Saurians. And while\r\nthe Saurian vertebræ are provided with long transverse processes and\r\nupper and lower spinous-processes (Dorn-Fortsätzen), they seem in\r\nthe Pterodactyle to be almost devoid of processes and resemble those\r\nof mammals, on the tails of which these processes soon disappear.\r\nIn a certain point of view we could say of the vertebral column of\r\nthe Pterodactyle, that it has borrowed the neck from the bird, the\r\ntrunk from the reptile, and the tail from the mammal. The ribs are\r\nconnected to the transverse processes as in crocodiles, except with the\r\natlas and axis. Quite in the type of the Saurians are the abdominal\r\nribs, which are wanting to all birds and mammals, but often occur in\r\nthe Lacertian order. The structure of the shoulder and breast-bone\r\nseparate the Pterodactyle from the mammal, these parts being formed\r\nafter the type of the Birds and Saurians, the characters of which are\r\nblended together. The small and elongated shoulder-blade, like the\r\ncoracoid bone, belongs to the type of the bird rather than to that\r\nof the Saurians, of which, in reference to the last-named bone, only\r\ncrocodiles have a similar one. The breast-bone, by its large expansion,\r\npoints to the crocodiles, but at the same time, by the want of the\r\nkeel, points to the ostrich-like birds, save that it is proportionally\r\nlarger and wider than in these. The Pterodactyle, in common with the\r\ncrocodile, wants the patella. The pelvis is formed on the type of the\r\nSaurians, although the ilium, by length and form, points somewhat to\r\nthe mammals. The length and delicate form of the long bones of the\r\nlimb, as well as the larger development of the fore-arm than of the\r\nupper-arm, and larger development of the lower thigh than of the upper\r\nthigh, and the thinness and elegance and shortness of the ?fibula\r\n(Wadenbein) have the characters of birds. The length of the middle hand\r\n[metacarpals] resembles that of birds, but its form in Pterodactyle\r\nis conformable to that of mammals. The first three fingers have the\r\nform and condition of the phalanges of lizards. The phalanges form the\r\nseries 2, 3, and 4. The fourth, or air-finger, on the contrary, is\r\nof a peculiar type, of which no analogue is found in other animals,\r\nunless a somewhat similar arrangement be accredited to the bats. It\r\nis of enormous length, composed of four parts and without a claw.\r\nThe hind-leg is, in proportion to the fore-leg, weak, and in general\r\ndoes not take the bird-form, but that of a Saurian. It has five toes,\r\nwith unusual arrangement of the phalanges into the series 1, 5, 4,\r\n3, 2. One toe has no nail, and the others have claws weaker than\r\nthose of the hand. It can hardly be supposed that the animal lived\r\nin the water. All Saurians that live either in the water or on land\r\nare short-legged; it is the same with the swimming birds. But the\r\nPterodactyle has its hind-legs as long as a land or air-bird; and as in\r\nthese, the shin especially exceeds the length of the thigh. At the same\r\ntime the toes, when they are in their natural position, were so close\r\ntogether that we may suppose the animal not to have been web-footed.\r\nThe great development of the hand, by means of the long middle hand\r\nand especially of the enormous length of the air-finger, makes it\r\nprobable that it was the chief organ of flight, as in birds and bats;\r\nalso deviating in a peculiar manner from both these types, the long\r\nair-finger served to expand the wing-membrane, which extended from the\r\nupper part of the finger to the trunk, and which in all probability\r\ndid not touch the hind-legs. This we infer from the circumstance that\r\nthe animal, in a position with the organs of flight folded up, was\r\nnot supported like the bat on its four feet, but stood upright on its\r\nhind-legs like a bird. Such a position presumes the same freedom in\r\nmoving the hind extremities as with birds; only in such a position\r\ncould the animal walk on without being hindered by its flying organs\r\nwhen they were folded up like those of a bird. Only in such an upright\r\nposition could the animal keep upright its unusually long head with the\r\nlong and strong neck and be kept in balance, the neck being able to\r\ntake a sigmoid curve like that of a bird.\r\n\r\nWagner concludes: \"By these means we have recognised in the\r\nPterodactyle a Saurian, but of a habitude which greatly removes him\r\nfrom all others of his kind, and approximates him to birds. Excepting\r\nin ability to fly, he has nothing in common with the birds. The opinion\r\n'that the animal is half crocodile half monitor disguised as a bird,\r\nbut intending to be a bird,' is therefore not only a paradox but also\r\nfalse. With more truth, but less phantasy, we could say that the\r\nPterodactyle was a Saurian in transition to the Birds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nQuenstedt[J].\r\n\r\n[Footnote J: _Ueber Pterodactylus Suevicus._ Tubingen 1855.\r\n\r\nIn the long thigh, with the long neck, Quenstedt sees evidence that the\r\nanimal was able to walk upright, being probably still more upright than\r\nbirds, since the great disproportion between the neck on the one hand,\r\nand the thigh on the other, could not have allowed a more appropriate\r\nposition. At the same time he makes a question, Did it go on four feet?\r\nBut a little later, in his book, _Sonst und Jetzt_, 1856, he gives\r\na sketch of the animal resting on its four legs; and remarks, \"The\r\nposition upon four feet is however hypothetical, but is probable. It\r\nhad its wings folded back. The slightly curved and thin bones of the\r\nmiddle hand probably served to support the flying-membrane, and had\r\ntherefore the same function as the spur-bone in the bats.\" Finally, he\r\nsays in his book, _der Jura_, p. 813, \"Perhaps this animal walked from\r\ntime to time on four legs, being then supported by the fore-end of the\r\nmetatarsal bone.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nBurmeister[K].\r\n\r\n[Footnote K: _Beleuchtung uniger Pterodactylus arten._ 1855.]\r\n\r\nentirely rejects Quenstedt's opinions with regard to their upright\r\nposition. He makes the following remarks: 'The animal walked on the\r\nfree fore-toes and bore the wings like a bat, though with the body not\r\nin an upright position like a bird, but four-footed. The hind-foot is\r\nmuch too small for such an upright position, and the fore-foot much too\r\nstrongly developed. I therefore believe that the Pterodactyle could\r\nmuch better have walked four-footed than a bat, because it possessed so\r\nmuch better developed fore-feet.' In the length of the tibia Burmeister\r\nsees no reason for the upright position, but, as he says, only a means\r\nfor the wide expansion of the flying-membrane;--and an endeavour in\r\nwalking on four feet to bring the leg into the necessary harmony with\r\nthe arm, which is so much elongated with the flat-hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nHermann von Meyer[L].\r\n\r\n[Footnote L: _Fauna der Vorwelt. Reptilien aus dem Lithographischen\r\nschiefer._ Frankfurt am Main. 1859. pp. 15-23.]\r\n\r\nThe skull of the Pterodactyle can only be compared with those of\r\nbirds and lizards. The form is essentially Avian, and the sutures are\r\nindistinct or obliterated as in birds, while in reptiles they are\r\npersistent The temporal bone enters into the formation of the reservoir\r\nfor the brain, which is eminently characteristic of birds and quite\r\ndifferent from anything found in lizards. The snout resembles a bird in\r\nbeing chiefly formed by the intermaxillary bone, which bounds the front\r\nof the anterior nares; and, as in birds, the bone extends backward\r\nbetween the eye-cavities to the frontal bone. The corresponding\r\nintermaxillary ridge of the Monitor is of less extent.\r\n\r\nThe frontal-bone forms the highest part of the skull, and is similar\r\nto that of birds. The principal frontal is double, and forms the upper\r\nand hind part of the cavity for the eye, and covered the greater part\r\nof the large brain, composed of two hemispheres, in which Oken long\r\nago saw a similarity to the higher animals. The arched form of the\r\nback part of the skull is bird-like. The double parietal adjoins the\r\nprincipal frontal, and is conditioned like the parietal in birds. The\r\nsupra-occipital is single as in birds, expanded, and forms the part of\r\nthe skull which extends furthest back. From the form of the back part\r\nof the skull it may be concluded that the foramen magnum was situated\r\nas in birds, and that the head and neck were moved as in birds, and not\r\nas in reptiles and mammals.\r\n\r\nThe temporal bone rests upon the parietal and frontal, and forms much\r\nof the temporal foss. Its anterior border does not appear to enter\r\ninto the margin of the orbital cavity as in birds, but seems to be\r\nreplaced by the post-frontal, which resembles that of the Chameleon.\r\nIts hindmost branch, which can hardly be supposed to be the jugal,\r\nforms the outer boundary of the temporal foss by uniting with a process\r\nwhich is probably part of the mastoid. A similar closing of the cavity\r\nfor the temporal muscles is also to be found in birds. The jugal\r\nand maxillary do not follow the bird type. The jugal consists of a\r\nsingle bone which forms the greater part of the anterior and inferior\r\nboundary of the cavity of the eye, which is surrounded with bones, as\r\nin Dragons and Iguana. In those birds in which the cavity of the eye is\r\nsurrounded with bones the jugal does not enter into it. As in lizards,\r\nat its upper end the jugal is commonly connected with the lachrymal,\r\nwhich bone is like that of a bird. A bone, which appears to be the\r\npre-frontal, enters into the back of the nasal aperture.\r\n\r\nThe nostril is double and often of large size.\r\n\r\nThe perforation in the skull between the orbit and nares is bird-like.\r\n\r\nThe quadrate bone is not quadratic as in birds, but cylindrical and\r\nshaft-like, as in the Chameleon. The articulation of the quadrate with\r\nthe lower jaw is placed further forward than in birds and reptiles. The\r\nlower jaw, but for the teeth, has great similarity with that of a bird.\r\nAmong reptiles its nearest resemblance is with Chameleons and Turtles.\r\nThe hyoid is more bird-like than reptile-like.\r\n\r\n_Ribs and vertebræ._\r\n\r\nIt is uncertain whether the Pterodactyle had lumbar vertebræ. If they\r\nare wanting, therein the animals resemble birds, of which we are\r\nreminded in the short and stiff back and moveable neck. Pterodactyles\r\npossess a smaller number of neck-vertebræ and a larger number of\r\nback-vertebræ than birds. The long neck-vertebræ are paralleled by\r\nthose of water-birds, by the Giraffe, the Camel, Protosaurus and\r\nTanystrophæus. There are 7 cervical vertebræ, the 1st very short, 2nd\r\nnot longer, but rather shorter than those which follow. There are in\r\nPterodactyles from 12 to 16 dorsal vertebræ, while birds have never\r\nmore than 11. It is not certain whether all Pterodactyles have an os\r\nsacrum; most have it, and therein resemble Mammals, Birds, and some\r\nfossil Saurians. In Pterodactylus dubius and P. grandipelvis and P.\r\nKochi there are 5 or 6 vertebræ in the sacrum. In birds the sacral\r\nvertebræ vary from 5 to 22; in bats the number is from 5 to 6.\r\n\r\nThe short tails of Pterodactyles are more like those of mammals than\r\nbirds; they include from 10 to 15 tail-vertebræ. In birds there are\r\nfrom 6 to 10 tail-vertebræ. Rhamphorhynchus has 38-40 tail-vertebræ,\r\nsecured between thread-bones like those in the tail of rats.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal ribs are reptile-like. In herbivorous mammals and birds\r\nthey are broader. A few species have the first pair of ribs large. The\r\nabdominal ribs belong neither to birds nor mammals, but are reptilian.\r\nIn Rhamphorhynchus Gemmingi there are 6 pairs of sternal ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The sternum_\r\n\r\nis bird-like, somewhat resembling lizards. It consists of a simple\r\nflat bone, but without the keel of a bird's sternum. It is relatively\r\nsmaller than in birds, is broader than long, and therefore comparable\r\nwith Struthious birds. They were not able flyers, since the part to\r\nwhich the muscles for flight should be affixed is wanting. And for\r\nthe same reason they could not have been wandering animals. But Moles\r\npossess a keel on the breast-bone, which therefore is no evidence\r\nof flight. And in swimming-birds which do not fly the keel is much\r\ndeveloped; and in swimming-birds the sternum is also long, so that\r\nneither length nor keel prove flight. So far as the evidence from the\r\nsternum goes, they were neither water-birds, nor diggers, but denizens\r\nof the air. In Rhamphorhynchus Gemmingi, besides the usual breast-bone,\r\nthere is a plate with breast-ribs uniting the sternum with the dorsal\r\nribs; they are cartilaginous, or horny, as in birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The scapula and coracoid_\r\n\r\npresent the closest resemblance with those of a bird, and only deviate\r\nin the coracoid not being inserted in the breast-bone in the manner\r\nof birds[M]. It at first seemed that Rhamphorhynchus differed from\r\nPterodactyle in having the scapula and coracoid anchylosed. In R.\r\nGemmingi the bones are either separated or only slightly united.\r\n\r\n[Footnote M: See however Pl. 1 and 2 of this memoir.]\r\n\r\nOken and Goldfuss thought that the scapula consists of an upper and\r\nunder part, as in lizards. Von Meyer sees nothing of the kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The humerus_\r\n\r\npresents no striking similarity with birds, and differs from bats.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The carpus_\r\n\r\nis more reptile-like. It consists of two rows of small bones. In birds\r\nthere is one row made up of two bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The pteroid bone._\r\n\r\nVon Meyer regards it as having supported the wing-membrane in flight.\r\nThere has been a good deal of difference of opinion about it, some\r\nthinking it, with Quenstedt, an ossified tendon; others, like Wagner\r\nand Burmeister, regarding it as an essential part of the Pterodactyle\r\nskeleton. Von Meyer regards its extent as indicating the extent of the\r\nwing-membrane. See p. 42.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Metacarpus._\r\n\r\nIn length the metacarpus resembles that of the Ruminants, in which\r\nhowever it consists of but one bone; while in Pterodactyles there is\r\na separate bone for each of the four fingers; they are closely united\r\ntogether without being blended. In some Pterodactyles the metacarpals\r\nof the short fingers are as fine as hairs, so that it is impossible\r\nthat they should have articular facets on the carpus. In Ornithopterus\r\nthe metacarpus has some resemblance with that of the bird, but the\r\narticulation with the phalanges of the finger for flight is stiff. In\r\nPterodactylus and Rhamphorhynchus there is a free articulation.\r\n\r\nBurmeister remarks that the chief articulation of the wing in bats is\r\nwith the carpus, while in Pterodactyle the articulation is with the end\r\nof the metacarpus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The hand._\r\n\r\nVon Meyer finds four fingers. It was formerly supposed that the order\r\nof the phalanges was 2, 3, 4, 4, but in the fly-finger this is not the\r\ncase, Ornithopterus having but two. The number of joints in the other\r\nfingers is quite as irregular.\r\n\r\nIn Pt. longicollum the thumb consists of but one joint.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ilium_\r\n\r\nis more mammalian and avian than reptilian.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pubis._\r\n\r\nThe pubis appears to have been excluded from the glenoid cavity, as\r\nin Crocodiles. It is more mammal-like than bird-like, and is to be\r\ncompared with the marsupial bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The femur._\r\n\r\nIn certain Pterodactyles the proximal condyle of the femur resembles\r\nbirds; but in other Pterodactyles the bone is more mammal-like in its\r\nstraightness, and development of the upper condyle, and in the presence\r\nof a trochanter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The tibia and fibula_\r\n\r\nmay be compared, from their great length, with birds and flying\r\nvertebrate animals.\r\n\r\nThe fibula is style-shaped, like that of a bird, the lower part being\r\nwanting; while in bats the upper part is wanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The tarsus,_\r\n\r\nof two rows, is best compared with that of reptiles. The number of\r\nconstituent bones has not been definitely determined.\r\n\r\n_The metatarsus_\r\n\r\nshows a certain return from the bird type to that of reptiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Foot._\r\n\r\nVon Meyer never finds more than four toes, and sometimes a stump of a\r\nfifth. As a whole, the foot is Saurian-like. It differs from lizards in\r\nthe number of toes, and approximates to Crocodiles. In Pterodactylus\r\nlongirostris the formula of the toes is 2, 3, 4, 5, with a stump of two\r\njoints;--like lizards, if we abstract the outer toe; and like birds\r\nwith four toes; but they are liable to variations.\r\n\r\nIn Pterodactylus scolopaciceps and P. Kochi the formula is 2, 3, 3,\r\n4 joints. In Winkler's specimen of P. Kochi there is also a stump of\r\nthree joints.\r\n\r\nIn Pterodactylus micronyx the formula is 2, 3, 3, 3, and a stump of two\r\njoints. In P. longicollum the number appears to be different from all\r\nthe foregoing.\r\n\r\nThe stump was attached to the side of the outer toe. Wagner, in P.\r\nKochi, supposed it to be on the inner side, and so gave a reverse\r\narrangement to the toes. The stump may be compared with that of some\r\nChelonians, in which it is not furnished with a claw.\r\n\r\nThere is a difference from birds in the claws being much less\r\ndeveloped. It has a true reptile foot. In bats the toes are of equal\r\nlength. Von Meyer thinks the hind-legs did not enable it to walk on the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIn some Pterodactyles the flying-membrane is faintly seen. The presence\r\nof feathers might be inferred from there being but one finger for\r\nflighty as in birds; but the function of feathers is subserved by the\r\nlong and stiff finger. If it had been covered with scales, as was\r\nsupposed by Cuvier, some traces of them would be found. The skin was\r\nprobably naked, and had no connection with the hind-legs as it has in\r\nbats; in this respect resembling birds.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the several parts of the skeleton completely proves\r\nthat the Pterodactyle was a reptile. Its head, neck, shoulder, and\r\nback, resemble a bird; while there are, on the other hand, some\r\nstriking resemblances with the reptile in the pelvis, tail, and\r\narticular parts of the limbs. Sometimes the characters of the two\r\nclasses run side by side, as in the skull, the fore-limbs, and\r\nespecially in the hind-limbs, where the shin of a Bird is connected\r\nwith the foot of a Saurian. The parts in which it corresponds with\r\nbirds show that Pterodactyles also were flying animals. That we should\r\nbe entitled to conclude, from the hollow state of the bones, that they\r\nbelonged to flying animals, is sufficiently proved by Blumenbach,\r\nBuckland, Mantell, Owen having mistaken them for bones of birds.\r\n\r\nThe most absolute proof that it was a flying animal is the pneumatic\r\ncharacter of its bones. This condition was discerned by me in some\r\nPterodactyle bones from the Lias of Franken (_Jahrb. für Mineral_,\r\n1837, p. 316), and was afterwards established by Owen in the\r\nPterodactyles from the Chalk of England. This structure was previously\r\nonly known in birds. And the supposition readily follows that in the\r\nrespiratory process there was some similarity between the Pterodactyle\r\nand the Birds. They have the proportions of upper-arm and fore-arm\r\nwhich characterize birds of great flight, the humerus short and the\r\nfore-arm long; hence it may be presumed that Pterodactyles could fly\r\nwell. From the absence and presence of the bony sclerotic ring in the\r\neye, it may be supposed that the Pterodactyles were active in the\r\nday-time, while Rhamphorhynchus was nocturnal.\r\n\r\nAfter this statement von Meyer gives a discursive summary, in which his\r\nviews of the classification of reptiles in general and of Pterodactyles\r\nin particular are epitomized. And then goes on to combat the views of\r\npeople who have departed from his classification and attempted to set\r\nup classifications of their own; and cites a number of authors who,\r\nlabouring at the vertebrata, have endeavoured to find a resting-place\r\nin their systems for the Pterodactyle. But the chief thing we learn of\r\nvon Meyer's own views is, that in 1830 he published a classification of\r\nextinct Saurians, dividing them into those with limbs like the larger\r\nand heavier land-mammals, those with fin-like limbs, and those with a\r\nflying-finger. Which divisions have been widely adopted, though authors\r\nhave sometimes given them other names than those by which they were\r\nfirst made known.\r\n\r\nVon Meyer has freely stated the facts about the Pterodactyle, and draws\r\nthe conclusion that the animal was a reptile; but how such a conclusion\r\nwas obtained from such facts is a matter on which his pages are silent.\r\nOne seems to hear the chirrup of the bird in almost every paragraph.\r\nThe head is in the main a bird's head; the pectoral girdle and the\r\nsternal ribs are those of a bird; and very few are the structures in\r\nwhich some reminder of the bird is not present; and in their bones he\r\ndiscovered the pneumatic characteristic and inferred, for the animals\r\nbird-like lungs. How, then, comes it that the Pterodactyle is a\r\nreptile? We can only suppose the answer to be, Because if the head and\r\npectoral girdle and other bones had been reptilian it would have been a\r\nbird.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the views here epitomized it is difficult always to make out the\r\nlogical foundations of the conclusions arrived at. Sometimes they have\r\nno foundations, and sometimes they represent the different aspects\r\nin which a truth presents itself to minds differently constituted\r\nor differently conversant with the structures of living animals. In\r\nnow stating my own views I shall avail myself of the example of some\r\nprevious writers, and attempt to investigate the Pterodactyle as though\r\nthey had not written. And then, having placed before him all the\r\ntheories that are known, the reader will be able to choose the theory\r\nthat pleases him best, if indeed he needs one.\r\n\r\nMuch of the discrepancy of opinion that exists is probably due to the\r\nuse of the inductive method of thought for the discovery of fundamental\r\nprinciples in classification. In palæontology, where the types are\r\nmore generalized than are living forms, it must always be difficult to\r\nreason from the known to the unknown. The known is always more or less\r\nincomparable with the unknown; and there can be no reason for inferring\r\nthat the specialities of structure which now accompany specialities\r\nin organization would justify us in inferring for the animal, in which\r\nthe structures formerly were united, the combined organizations of\r\nthe living animals in which they are now found. On any hypothesis\r\nof evolution it would be allowed that the special modifications of\r\na group were attained subsequently to the common plan of the larger\r\ngroup to which it belongs, and are entirely to be attributed to the\r\nfunction which the necessities or organization of the animal caused\r\nits structures to subserve. Inductive thought may sometimes discover\r\nfunction from structure, but never makes more than an approximate\r\nguess when it endeavours to determine fundamental organization from\r\nosseous structures which are not fundamental. And before a naturalist\r\ncan say, since an animal has for instance a tail like a mammal that in\r\nso far it must be affiliated to the mammalia, he must have determined\r\nwhy the mammalian tail has its peculiar characters, and whether it is\r\ncompatible with any other common plan of organization. And perhaps it\r\nmight with equal reason be considered reptilian.\r\n\r\nTherefore I prefer at firsts instead of reasoning from the details\r\nof structure, to adopt the _à priori_ method, and ask, not what the\r\nPterodactyle is like in its several bones, but what common plan it had\r\nwhereon its hard structures were necessarily moulded. For I imagine, if\r\nit can be determined what the nervous and respiratory and circulatory\r\nstructures of the Pterodactyle were, it becomes a secondary matter to\r\nknow whether the phalanges are like a lizard's, or the pelvis like that\r\nof a mammal. If the animal is asserted to be a mammal, a reptile, or a\r\nbird, we ought to be able to adduce evidence that it had the soft parts\r\nwhich are deemed distinctive of the selected class. This no one has\r\ndone or attempted to do.\r\n\r\nHereafter it will be necessary to describe the Pterodactyle's brain.\r\n\r\nThere is no organ more distinctive between hot-blooded animals on the\r\none hand, and cold-blooded animals on the other, than the brain. In\r\nthe cold-blooded groups, or those in which respiration is feeble and\r\ncirculation imperfect, that is to say, in existing fishes, amphibians,\r\nand reptiles, the parts of the brain are arranged one behind another,\r\nso that when looked upon from above, a portion called the optic lobes\r\nintervenes between the anterior masses called the cerebrum and the\r\nposterior mass called the cerebellum. In the hot-blooded groups, or\r\nthose with an enormous extent of lung-surface for oxidation of the\r\nblood and a four-celled heart for its rapid circulation, that is to\r\nsay, in birds and mammals, the front part of the brain called the\r\ncerebrum is immensely developed in proportion to the other parts,\r\nand abuts against the cerebellum and more or less completely covers\r\nthe optic lobes, which in birds are squeezed out to the sides. The\r\nPterodactyle brain is of this latter kind. And it being taken as a\r\npostulate that this kind of brain is the product of the organization\r\nwhich produces hot blood, it follows that the Pterodactyle was a\r\nhot-blooded animal.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Pterodactyle has perforations for pneumatic cells in many of\r\nthe bones.\r\n\r\nThere is no structure in the animal kingdom more distinctive of a\r\nClass of animals than air-cells perforating the limb-bones. They are\r\nconnected with a peculiar kind of lung and heart--those of the bird;\r\nfor in this Class the bronchial tubes open on the outer surface of\r\nthe lungs into air-cells, which are prolonged through the body into\r\nthe bones. They follow the blood-vessels, and are most developed in\r\nthe part of the body most used. In some lizards, as the Chameleon,\r\nthe sack-like lung at its distal termination is as simple as the\r\nair-cells of a bird; but those air-cells are not comparable with the\r\nbird's air-cells, since they are not prolongations of the bronchial\r\ntubes through the walls of the lungs. And it cannot be inferred that\r\na reptile with wings would develop air-cells like those of a bird:\r\nin the first place, because those mammals which have wings do not\r\ndevelop air-cells; and, in the second place, because there is nothing\r\nin existing nature to lead any one to think that reptiles might have\r\nwings. The mammalian lung is better comparable to that of a bird than\r\nis the Chameleon lung, and therefore the air-cell structure might\r\nwith better reason have been anticipated to occur in the Chiroptera\r\nthan in a Lizard-ally, if it were dependent on the development of\r\nwings. Moreover, among Struthious birds the legs have more of the\r\nair-cell prolongations than the wings. Therefore, being a peculiar\r\nAvian structure which only exists in association with the Avian heart\r\nand lung, it follows that because the Pterodactyle had the pneumatic\r\nforamina it also had the structures of which they are the evidence,\r\nviz. lung and heart formed on the bird plan.\r\n\r\nThus Pterodactyles have a nervous system of the bird type. That kind of\r\nbrain only exists in association with a four-celled heart and hot blood.\r\n\r\nThey have a respiratory organization which is only met with among birds.\r\n\r\nWith that respiratory apparatus is always associated a four-celled\r\nheart and hot blood, which it would necessarily produce.\r\n\r\nAnd with that respiratory organization is always associated a brain of\r\nthe type that the Pterodactyle is found to possess.\r\n\r\n_Therefore it is firmly indicated that the general plan of the most\r\nvital and important of the soft structures was similar to that of\r\nliving birds._\r\n\r\nThis proposition will be incidentally proved in the following memoir,\r\nin which it will be seen that with such a common plan, is associated a\r\ndiversity of details sufficient to demonstrate that these animals are\r\nnot birds, but constitute a new group of vertebrata of equal value with\r\nthe birds--the sub-class, Ornithosauria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        OSTEOLOGICAL COLLECTION\r\n\r\n\r\n               ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE MODIFICATIONS OF THE\r\n                ORNITHOSAURIA (OR PTERODACTYLES) IN THE\r\n                      CAMBRIDGE UPPER GREENSAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pectoral Girdle.\r\n\r\n  STERNUM.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 1, fig. 1.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet.\r\n   =J=     _a_      1\r\n\r\nThe Sternum is the key to the bony apparatus supporting the anterior\r\nlimbs. In the Pterodactyles from the Cambridge Greensand it has been\r\nwell figured and described by Professor Owen, who enunciated its\r\nresemblance to the sternum of birds. The sternum in Pterodactyles from\r\nthe Lithographic Slate, shows its proportional size to the body. The\r\nexamples found in the Cambridge Greensand have as yet shown no evidence\r\nof a composite character like that attributed to Rhamphorhynchus\r\nGemmingi.\r\n\r\nThe sternum consists of an expanded symmetrical shield having its\r\nlateral halves, which are inclined to each other at a large angle\r\n(about 150°), contracted superiorly, behind and immediately below the\r\nsynovial cavities for the coracoids. The vertical angular ridge in\r\nwhich the lateral portions of the sternum unite becomes elevated as it\r\nis followed anteriorly, into a strong keel. This keel or interpectoral\r\nprocess is highest in front of the articulations for the coracoids; but\r\nthe degree of elevation varies with the species. It is prolonged upward\r\nand in front of the coracoids for some distance, becoming very massive,\r\nand the prolonged mass which is flattened from side to side, reaches\r\nlaterally to the outer margins of the coracoid articulations, and on\r\nthe visceral side a little between and over them. The anterior crest of\r\nthe keel shows the attachment of powerful muscles.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen has observed that only in birds are distinct synovial\r\ncavities provided for the coracoids, and that no reptile has a\r\nsternum showing characters like those seen in the Pterodactyle. These\r\ncoracoid cavities are placed as in birds, close together, behind the\r\n_manubrium_, which forms the hindermost part of the keel. They are\r\nconvex transversely, concave from front to back as in birds, and\r\nlook upward at an angle of 35°, their main direction being outward\r\nand a little backward. Professor Owen recognises the function of the\r\nshield-shaped sternum in relation to the mechanism of respiration on\r\nthe one hand, and on the other hand, for the attachment of pectoral\r\nmuscles of great bulk and strength.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the muscles of the breast in most birds consist\r\nchiefly of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd pectoral muscles, and the\r\ncoraco-brachialis.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar form of the bird's sternum appears to be due to the\r\nvertical development of the second pectoral muscle, since when the 1st\r\nand 3rd muscles are dissected off, the appearance presented nearly\r\nresembles that of the sternum in Pterodactyles. There can however be\r\nno doubt but that the third pectoral muscle, which in most birds is\r\nbut feebly developed, attained a far greater bulk in the Pterodactyle,\r\nbecause there is evidence of its powerful insertion in the distal\r\nanterior face of the coracoid, as well as of the great lateral\r\nextension of the sternal shield to which such a muscle must--by the\r\nanalogy of birds--have been attached. The peculiar lateral emargination\r\nof the sternum appears to be due to the anterior sternal termination of\r\nthis muscle, caused by the outward direction of the coracoid bone.\r\n\r\nSince the coracoids were developed outward and backward so much more\r\nthan in birds, it would happen, from the apparent different direction\r\nof the second pectoral muscle, that the first pectoral muscle which in\r\nbirds skirts the furculum, must have passed over the coracoid, probably\r\npulling on its inside in opposition to the third pectoral. Either a\r\nsubdivision of this muscle or a distinct muscle in the same place, in\r\nfunction corresponding to the subclavius muscle, appears to have been\r\npowerfully attached from the anterior prolongation of the keel of the\r\nsternum to the front face of the coracoid. It is improbable that the\r\nsecond pectoral muscle was undeveloped, but merely directed differently\r\nto what it is in birds, since, as will be seen, there is a process at\r\nthe proximal end of the coracoid homologous with that which forms the\r\npulley round which this muscle in birds works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen concludes his remarks by observing that the Pterosaurian\r\nbreast-bone is in the main formed on the ornithic type. The muscles\r\nalso appear to be similar to those of birds.\r\n\r\nAll the specimens are much mutilated, but all show the distinctive\r\npost-coracoid lateral emarginations, but as these are not seen in\r\nGerman Pterodactyles they are to be regarded as characters of a\r\npeculiar sub-order and not as characteristics of the sub-class.\r\n\r\nThe example figured in this memoir and by Professor Owen is 2-5/8\r\ninches in antero-posterior measurement, probably about one third its\r\nentire length.\r\n\r\nA small example in the collection of Mr Reed of York extends 1-1/4\r\ninch in the same measurement, and by the analogy of _P. suevicus_ was\r\nmore than twice that length when perfect. It is remarkable in that the\r\ncoracoid facets look much less outward and much more backward than in\r\nthe larger species.\r\n\r\nThe mammalian sternum is usually in many consecutive pieces like the\r\nvertebral column. The types in which it attains any size as an expanded\r\nshield are Cetaceans and the Manatee, but in these groups it has no\r\nkeel and is not connected with the other bones of the pectoral girdle.\r\nThe proximal portion of the sternum of the Mole is elongated and\r\nbird-like, with the shield narrower than in the typical gallinaceous\r\nbirds, and with the keel similarly developed. It is connected with the\r\nhumerus by small sub-quadrate bones named clavicles placed at the sides\r\nof the proximal end. The sternum in Bats usually consists of a proximal\r\nand a distal part. It is narrow except at the proximal-termination\r\nwhere it widens like the letter T or Y; and to the sides of the lateral\r\nprolongations are attached the long, slender, curved bones named\r\nclavicles, and a pair of ribs. This sternum develops a bird-like keel.\r\nBoth Mole and Bat are regarded as differing from Pterodactyles in the\r\nbone giving attachment to the clavicles instead of to the coracoids.\r\nThe proximal part of the sternum in both the living animals, gives\r\nattachment to but one pair of sternal ribs. The Pterodactyle sternum\r\notherwise differs from the Bats in having the articulations for the\r\ncoracoids close together, of a peculiar concavo-convex character, with\r\na massive portion or keel prolonged forward in front of the coracoid\r\narticulations. The Bat cannot be said to resemble the Pterodactyle\r\nclosely. The sternum of the Mole differs from that of the Pterodactyle\r\nin having a less developed shield, and in having a more developed keel\r\nwhich is not prolonged in front of the coracoid articulations. These\r\nexamples demonstrate that resemblance in conformation is functional,\r\nand no proof of affinity.\r\n\r\nPterodactyles make some approach in the proportions of their sternum\r\nto Struthious birds. But the Struthionidæ have the bone thick, do\r\nnot develop a keel, nor, have they an inter-coracoid process while\r\nthe coracoid articulations are singularly long and narrow instead\r\nof being ovate. With other birds the Pterodactyle sternum agrees in\r\ngiving attachment to the coracoid bones by synovial articulations, in\r\nthe bone being shield-shaped, and supporting a more or less developed\r\nkeel. The keel is chiefly developed at the proximal end, as in the\r\nAlbatross, which has the bone broad; and it is prolonged in front of\r\nthe coracoids exactly as in _Mergus merganser_, which sternum if a\r\nlittle broader in the shield and thicker in the keel would very nearly\r\nreproduce the sternum of the Pterodactyle, even to the \"post-coracoid\r\nlateral emargination\" of Cambridge specimens. Among reptiles the only\r\nform which suggests comparison is the Chameleon, in which however the\r\nsternum consists of an anterior and a posterior part as in the Bats,\r\nthe back part narrow, and the front part a long lozenge shape, with\r\na keel made by inclination of the sides of the bone to each other as\r\nin the Dodo, but the keel such as it is, is at the back part of the\r\nbone, and there is no prolongation in front of the coracoids as in\r\nPterodactyle. The coracoids are broad, and are applied to the two\r\nanterior sides of the lozenge. The Crocodile has a narrow flat sternum\r\nwhich is prolonged anteriorly between the coracoids.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance is greater with mammals than with reptiles. From birds\r\nthe Pterodactyle sternum makes no essential difference, and in the\r\nMerganser finds a close ally.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CORACOID.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 2, fig. 1-6.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _a_     2      1-23\r\n\r\nCommonly the coracoid in the Cambridge Pterodactyles is anchylosed to\r\nthe scapula: occasionally the bones are separate, though the separation\r\nhas hitherto only been observed in the largest species. In 1851\r\nProfessor Owen, when figuring the anchylosed ends of the scapula and\r\ncoracoid in Pterodactylus giganteus (Bowerbank), observed that in no\r\npart of the skeleton does the Pterodactyle more nearly resemble a bird\r\nthan in the scapular arch; a view again urged emphatically in 1859 when\r\nsimilar fragments were described from the Cambridge Greensand. Since\r\nthen perfect examples of the coracoid have occurred, which show the\r\ncharacters given in the following description.\r\n\r\nThe bone is long, with sub-parallel sides, sub-triangnlar in section,\r\nwith the proximal end expanded exteriorly and posteriorly, resembling\r\nin form the coracoid of a bird. The front surface looks forward and\r\noutward; it is flattened, is a little convex transversely, and a\r\nlittle convex in length; it is rugose with muscular attachments, which\r\nterminate in a tubercle on the uppermost fourth of the front, usually\r\nnear to the inner side. The middle third of the slightly concave\r\ninside margin of the front aspect, is sharply angular; the parts above\r\nand below it have the angularity rounded off. The outside margin, a\r\nlittle more concave than the inside margin, is sharply angular in its\r\ndistal third, in which the front gradually widens to near the sternal\r\narticulation, when it contracts--the whole sternal termination of\r\nthe bone being directed a little inward towards the manubrium of the\r\nsternum. The inside, which faces the opposite coracoid, is convex\r\ntransversely in the lower half or two-thirds; its distal termination is\r\ncarried inward. The expanded proximal end of the inside is flattened,\r\nor channelled, by the developement inwardly, at the proximal end\r\nof the ridge formed with the front side, of a long strong process\r\nhomologous with that on the inner side of the coracoid in birds. The\r\nchannel so formed rounds on to the proximal surface of the bone, and\r\nextends backward to the limit of the scapula; over it the second\r\npectoral muscle may be presumed to have worked[N]. The third side of\r\nthe bone is much more concave in length than either of the others;\r\nit looks backward, outward, and downward, the proximal end being\r\nturned outward and downward more than the distal end; it is a little\r\nconcave transversely at the expanded proximal end. Near the distal\r\nend there are sometimes visible a few faint marks of the insertion of\r\nmuscular fibres, but they are much less distinct than those made by the\r\ncoraco-brachialis muscle in the corresponding region of the coracoid\r\nin birds. Throughout its length it rounds into the inner side, and the\r\nupper third rounds convexly into the front. On the most posterior part\r\nof this aspect of the proximal end is a groove terminating in a long\r\npneumatic foramen, partly in the coracoid, partly in the scapula.\r\n\r\n[Footnote N: The homologous process is more developed in Pterodactylus\r\ngiganteus. See f. 7. pl. XXXI. Owen, Cret. Rept.]\r\n\r\nThe muscular attachments on the front aspect of the coracoid appear to\r\nbe two; one large and long inserted into the inner half of the middle\r\nthird of the bone, terminating at the proximal end in a tubercle. No\r\nspecimen shows the distal end of the insertion. This may indicate a\r\nsubdivision of the first pectoral muscle. The other insertion, if it be\r\ndistinct, is long and much narrower and at the distal end of the bone.\r\nThis, according to the analogy of birds, should be the third pectoral\r\nmuscle; if the insertion should be but part of that to which it is\r\ndistally adjacent, then the third pectoral muscle must have had an\r\nenormous developement unparalleled in birds.\r\n\r\nThe distal end of the bone terminates in a synovial articulation\r\nconcave transversely, convex from front to back, in form transversely\r\novate: the narrow side of the articulation, like the thin edge of the\r\ncoracoid, being exterior. The articulation is about three fourths of\r\nthe transverse diameter of the distal end; it is at right angles with\r\nthe long axis of the bone, and looks downward and a little backward.\r\n\r\nThe proximal end, massively enlarged outward and backward, presents on\r\nthe proximal surface three well defined regions. The largest of these\r\nis an irregular flattened surface half ovate in form, inclined to the\r\naxis of the bone at about 45°, looking backward, and upward also,\r\nwhen the bone is held vertically; the mesial hindermost half of the\r\nradius of this area is occupied by a pneumatic cavity: to this surface\r\nis applied the scapula. The next largest surface is rectangular and\r\noblong, looking upward, outward, and a little forward. The transverse\r\naspect which looks outward being nearly half as long again as the\r\nantero-posterior aspect which looks forward; in the latter direction\r\nthe area is slightly concave, in the former direction it is slightly\r\nconvex; its posterior boundary is parallel with the front of the bone:\r\nthis area forms the anterior moiety of the glenoid cavity, to which the\r\nproximal end of the humerus is applied.\r\n\r\nThe remaining surface of the proximal end is sub-quadrate, adjoins the\r\ntwo other surfaces as well as the front and the inside of the shaft, it\r\nis conically concave.\r\n\r\nThe entire bone when applied to the sternum looked outward, backward\r\nand upward.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen remarked (1859) that the \"coracoid is shorter and\r\nstraighter in birds than in Pterodactyles, but is commonly broader, and\r\nwith a longer and stronger anterior process.\"\r\n\r\nThe points in which the Pterodactyle coracoid resembles that of\r\nbirds (e. g. Gallinaceæ) are the long slender triangular shaft; the\r\nconcavo-convex articulation to the sternum; the convexity of the distal\r\nend in front, and its concavity behind; the posterior aspect of its\r\nscapular surface, and the pneumatic foramen.\r\n\r\nThe points in which it is distinct from birds are that the bone is\r\nnot produced proximally beyond the glenoid cavity for the humerus,\r\nwhich, instead of being lateral as in birds, and looking outward,\r\nin Pterodactyles forms the proximal-termination of the bone. The\r\nsternal articulation is proportionally much shorter transversely in\r\nPterodactyles, terminating in a convex margin which rounds up into the\r\nthin outer margin, as in the immature coracoid of the common Cock.\r\nIt is bow-shaped in front instead of being straight, and is commonly\r\nlonger than in birds. The usual ossified connection with the scapula\r\nis not entirely unparalleled in birds, the whole pectoral girdle being\r\nsometimes anchylosed into a bony mass as in the frigate bird.\r\n\r\nIn the monotremata, the only mammals in which the coracoids are\r\nseparate bones, they rather recall those of Ichthyosaurus than those of\r\nany other animals, and have no connection with the sternum. The bone\r\nwhich represents it functionally in placental mammals is the clavicle.\r\n\r\nIn no reptile is there any structure resembling the Ornithosaurian\r\ncoracoid. The nearest approximation is made by the Crocodile, in which\r\nas in the Chameleon the pectoral girdle is formed as in pterodactyles\r\nand struthious birds by scapula, coracoid and sternum. But in the\r\nCrocodile the coracoid is compressed, and expanded from side to side\r\nboth proximally and distally. Distally it has no synovial articulation\r\nwith the sternum; and proximally a wide process of the bone extends\r\nbeyond the articulation for the humerus as in birds, only the scapula\r\nunites with the prolonged part, and the glenoid cavity looks forward\r\nand inward.\r\n\r\nThe coracoid is essentially avian in its affinities, though with\r\npeculiar characters of its own. In the German genera it closely\r\nresembles specimens from the Cambridge Greensand.\r\n\r\n23 specimens are exhibited. Nos. 4, 10, 12, are the middle parts of\r\nshafts of left coracoids. Nos. 3-12, 22, are the middle parts of shafts\r\nof right coracoids. Nos. 2, 5, 14, are proximal ends of left coracoids.\r\nNos. 1, 6, 8, 9, 23, are proximal ends of right coracoids. Nos. 15,\r\n16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, are distal ends of left coracoids. No. 13 is a\r\nnearly perfect left coracoid, and No. 7 is the glenoid cavity for the\r\nhumerus formed by a right coracoid with the anchylosed scapula.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SCAPULA.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 1, figs. 2-12.\r\n\r\n  Case.

The only example sufficiently\r\nperfect to give the length and proportions of the bone is preserved in\r\nthe collection of Mr Reed, of York. This left scapula is a stout strong\r\nbone, short in proportion to its strength, of flattened ovate form in\r\nsection, expanding at the humeral end into an irregular sub-rhomboid\r\nmass. It is smaller in the middle, contracting both from side to side\r\nand from back to front till the back to front measurement is 7/16 of\r\nan inch, and the side to side measurement is 11/16 of an inch, and\r\nit expands a little at the free end, which terminates in a smooth\r\nheart-shaped surface, convex in the long diameter, which measures 7/8\r\nof an inch, and flat in the short one, which measures nearly 5/8 of\r\nan inch; it is at right angles with the inside of the bone. The sharp\r\nsuperior lateral outline is concave, but less so than the inferior\r\nlateral outline; into that inferior aspect of the bone the sides are\r\nmore fully rounded. The flattened inner surface applied to the ribs is\r\nconcave in the length of the bone, which measures 3-1/2 inches; the\r\nposterior half of which is convex transversely, the anterior humeral\r\nhalf is concave transversely so as to be cup-shaped, and measures in\r\nextreme width 1-11/16 inch; the outline of the transversely convex\r\nouter side in length is nearly straight, but the exterior part and\r\nglenoid cavity of the proximal end is broken away, and there only\r\nremains a small median proximal sur&ce broken at both ends, a little\r\nconcave in length, measuring 5/8 of an inch, and convex in breadth\r\nmeasuring 1/4 of an inch.\r\n\r\nAs there is no specimen in the Woodwardian Museum showing clearly the\r\nconnection of the proximal with the distal end, the specimens are\r\narranged on separate tablets.\r\n\r\n\r\nHumeral End of Scapula.\r\n\r\nThe humeral end of the scapula exhibits in the different species much\r\ndiversity of form, spreading laterally from the shaft, and terminating\r\nin an elongated articular surface truncating the bone nearly at\r\nright angles. On its inferior border it throws out a large convex\r\ntuberosity, separated from the humeral articular surface by a deep\r\nemargination. From the tuberosity usually arises a crescentic row of\r\nmuscular insertions, which is continued inward and forward over the\r\nmost compressed part of the scapula towards the middle of the humeral\r\narticulation. From the superior margin, interior to the coracoid,\r\narises a prominent ridge, the spine of the scapula, which is directed\r\ndiagonally backward and downward, terminating in the middle of the\r\nouter surface, where it is bordered on the anterior aspect by a long\r\nnarrow muscular attachment. Between this spine and the elevated margin\r\nof the glenoid cavity the bone is much compressed and concave.\r\n\r\nOn the inside surface of the bone there appear to be small muscular\r\nattachments in front of and behind the great tuberosity. The area\r\nbetween the spine and the inner surface is sometimes flattened,\r\nsometimes gently convex.\r\n\r\nWith well-marked distinctive characters in the inferior tuberosity,\r\nthe pre-tuberous emargination and the thick rounded form of the bone,\r\nthe Pterodactyle scapula is intermediate in character between that\r\nof a mole, a bird, and the crocodile; wanting the sabre shape of the\r\nbird's scapula, it also wants the wide expanded form of the scapula of\r\nthe Crocodile, but resembles the latter in the direction and degree of\r\ndevelopement of the spine. This modification is probably due to the\r\noutward direction and clavicular function of the coracoid, as well as\r\nto the raptorial habit of the organism.\r\n\r\nIn no living Reptile is there a scapula to be compared with that\r\nof the Pterodactyle, for besides the free end being expanded, in\r\nthe crocodile, it is also thin and squamous and the bone makes a\r\ncontinuous curve with the coracoid as in struthious birds, and not a\r\nsharp angle as in Pterodactyles. The \"spine\" in crocodiles is on the\r\nanterior border of the bone and directed upward and backward, while in\r\nPterodactyles it is on the posterior border and directed upward and\r\nforward. In the Chameleon the scapula is more elongated and narrow,\r\nnarrower in proportion to its length than in Pterodactyle, but becomes\r\nrapidly wide at its union with the coracoid. It is curved in length so\r\nas to fit on to convex ribs. A scapula presenting some resemblance to\r\nPterodactyle is found in certain Liassic Ichthyosaurs.\r\n\r\nAmong mammals a straight elongated narrow scapula is rare. The mole\r\nhowever has a scapula of this kind somewhat cylindrical in its proximal\r\nhalf and not much expanded at the free end, on which there is a\r\nsmall spine. The anterior emargination above the glenoid cavity in\r\nPterodactyle is entirely mammalian, as is the anterior tuberosity above\r\nthe emargination, for it entirely corresponds with what in ruminants,\r\npachyderms and many mammals would be named the coracoid process. If\r\nthat process is accurately determined it is difficult to say what this\r\nis.\r\n\r\nIn birds there is often a prolonged process on the inner side of the\r\ncoracoid, which however extends interior to other parts of the scapula,\r\nand to this the furculum is attached. Such traces of a spine as are to\r\nbe detected in the swan conform to the Pterodactyle.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo bird has the scapula cylindrical, even struthious birds only making\r\nan approximation to such a condition; and no birds have the scapula so\r\nstraight. The bone is more avian and mammalian than reptilian; and\r\nmore avian than mammalian but with strong distinctive characters of its\r\nown.\r\n\r\n17 specimens of the humeral ends of scapulæ are exhibited. Nos. 1, 4,\r\n6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17 are left scapulæ.

In the group having the ulnar ridge developed\r\nthe pneumatic foramen is on the posterior aspect of the bone[O] under\r\nthe ulnar ridge, as in birds; but in some of the small Pterodactyles\r\nthe foramen is on the anterior surface, and on its radial side. This\r\nlatter kind of humerus has the distal end more or less divided into\r\nthree convex surfaces, while the radial crest is enormously developed\r\nand terminates in a smooth oblong flattened surface nearly as large\r\nas the proximal articular surface, and looking anteriorly. The distal\r\narticular surfaces are not as in birds parallel to that of the proximal\r\nend, though they agree with those of birds in being at right angles\r\nto the radial crest; this ridge in Pterodactyles being directed much\r\nfurther outward and backward than in birds.\r\n\r\n[Footnote O: Professor Owen states (p. 16, 3d Supt.) that the foramen\r\nis palmar. Fig. 15. T. III. 2d Supt. shows it to be anconal.]\r\n\r\nThe largest forms of Pterodactyle all have the distal articular surface\r\nflatter, and the proximal articulation less bent back so as to look\r\nmore upwards. No specimen of this kind of humerus has occurred with the\r\nradial crest preserved; but it is apparently carried farther down the\r\nshaft and not so far forward as in the other group. This latter kind\r\nof bone is shown by Prof. Owen in T. III. figs. 1, 2, 3rd Sup. Cret.\r\nReptiles; the former kind has been illustrated in figure 5 of the same\r\nplate.\r\n\r\nSome of the most gigantic Pterodactyles appear to have had the\r\nlimb-bones as solid as those of crocodiles, and unpermeated by air;\r\nand there is no evidence that the high Avian characteristics of most\r\nof these Greensand fossils also pertained to all the previously known\r\ntypes from the lower secondary rocks.\r\n\r\nThe osteological series comprises 46 specimens. No. 30 is a nearly\r\nperfect right humerus. Nos. 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 18, 22, 23, 25, 39\r\nare examples of the proximal ends of left humeri. Nos. 3, 4, 10, 12,\r\n13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 24, 26, 27, 28, 38, 40, 41 are examples of the\r\nproximal ends of right humeri. Nos. 20, 21, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 42, 44,\r\n45, are examples of the distal ends of left humeri. Nos. 29, 31, 36, 43\r\nand 46 are distal ends of right humeri.\r\n\r\nNo. 30 shows the entire length of the humerus to be 2-1/2 inches. It\r\nhas a nearly circular shaft with a diameter of a little more than a\r\nquarter of an inch, being more slender than the corresponding bone\r\nof Pt. suevicus, which has the same length. The _proximal_ articular\r\nsurface is crescentic, the anterior concavity corresponding with\r\nthe concave anterior aspect of the proximal end, while the convex\r\nborder corresponds to the convex posterior side of the bone, which\r\nit overhangs: it is worn, but appears to measure half an inch from\r\nthe radial to the ulnar side. The ulnar ridge (which is worn) has\r\nnot extended more than a quarter of an inch beyond the articular\r\nsurface. The thin bird-like radial crest, arising rather more distally\r\nthan the ulnar ridge, is flat on its posterior surface, and extends\r\nanteriorly for a distance nearly half as far again as the length of\r\nthe proximal articular surface of the humerus. On the proximal third\r\nof the posterior face are two contiguous long narrow oblique muscular\r\ninsertions. The proximal ends Nos. 22, 23, 24, 25 are examples of this\r\nkind of bone, having the pneumatic foramen radially situated on the\r\nanterior aspect near to the articular surface, as may be seen in No.\r\n24. No. 25 shows the termination of the radial crest in an oblique\r\noblong smooth surface, slightly convex in length and breadth, directed\r\ndistally towards the ulnar side.\r\n\r\nNo. 6, 7, 13, 27, are examples of another kind of proximal end,\r\nwhere the pneumatic foramen is an oval hole on the ulnar side of the\r\nposterior sur&ce. The radial crest arises more distally, and the ulnar\r\nridge more proximally, than in the small species, like No. 30.\r\n\r\nNos. 4, 11, 14, 16 are examples of other species with the foramen\r\nplaced as in the last group, only less near to the proximal end, while\r\nit enters obliquely, being directed distally from the broad concave\r\narea proximal to it. The largest proximal ends known, such as No. 2,\r\nwhich though very imperfect measures 2-3/4 inches over what remains of\r\nthe articular surface, appear to conform to this latter type.\r\n\r\n_Distally_ the humerus No. 30 enlarges, widening rapidly on the radial\r\nside, which is bordered near the distal end by a sharp ridge showing\r\na muscular attachment, while the ulnar side is rounded and rather\r\ninflated. The articular surface looks downward and in the direction\r\nof the radial process. There is a mesial concavity on the radial side\r\nwhich is bordered on the right and on the left by a prominent rounded\r\ncondyle, and behind by a condyloid convexity. On that side which in\r\nconformity with the nomenclature applied to birds' bones, has here been\r\nnamed the ulnar side, the ulnar and mesial condyles are impressed with\r\na flattened slightly concave sub-rhomboid area, which looks downward,\r\nbackward, and towards the ulnar side. These characters are not well\r\nseen in No. 30, but may be effectively studied in their specific\r\nvariations in Nos. 36, 37, 42, 43, 44, 45, and 46.\r\n\r\nNos. 20, 21, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, are examples of the distal ends of\r\nhumeri of a different type. They are mostly larger than the preceding\r\ngroup, and correspond in characters with the large proximal ends, but\r\nappear to be separable into two groups, namely those with a pneumatic\r\nforamen on the anterior radial side near to the articular surface,\r\nand those where no pneumatic foramen is seen. Unlike the previously\r\nconsidered type, the ulnar side is sometimes more inflated than the\r\nradial side.\r\n\r\nThe mesial condyle in this group appears in every case to be an\r\nepiphysis, which is wanting. The radial condyle becomes a large\r\nflattened slightly convex surface looking downwards, which in some of\r\nthe species, as Nos. 21 and 32 (in other respects remarkable species),\r\nshows an approach to a trochlear character on its anterior side. In\r\nNos. 33, 34 and 35 the mesial anterior concavity becomes flattened and\r\nabuts at an angle against the flattened radial condyle. No. 20 shows\r\nthe rhomboid impression on the ulnar side to be more concave and more\r\novate. The ulnar condyle remains a smaller but prominent tubercle\r\ndirected distally. Nos. 21, 22 and 34 show a ridge developed on the\r\nulnar side of the shaft like that on the radial side in the other\r\ngroup, while the radial ridge is not so near to the articular surface.\r\nThe largest and smallest distal ends of humeri known, both show the\r\ncharacters here enumerated. The great distal end of a left humerus,\r\nfigured by Prof. Owen, Pl. IV. f. 1, 2, 3 of the 1st Supplement to the\r\nCretaceous Pterosauria, is of this kind, and though imperfect measures\r\nmore than three inches over what remains of the articular surface. In\r\nthe small humerus, No. 30, the width over the distal articular surface\r\nis 5/8ths of an inch. If it is assumed that the large bone was no more\r\nthan 5 times the length of the small one, the entire length of the\r\nhumerus would have been about twelve inches. The smallest humerus, No.\r\n29, measures over the shaft rather more than one eighth of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe Ornithosaurian humerus has but little in common with that of any\r\nmammal. Most mammals have the proximal head of the bone hemispherical,\r\nand a pit at the distal end for the olecranon process of the ulna,\r\nwhile there is usually little indication of a radial crest, and the\r\nproximal and distal ends are in the same plane. In the Bat however the\r\nbone is twisted a little so that the slight radial crest looks in the\r\nsame direction as the distal end, here also there is no pit for the\r\nolecranon; but the bone is sigmoid and proportionally much longer than\r\nin Pterodactyles. In the horse, hippopotamus, &c., the radial process\r\nbecomes more developed but never resembles that of a Pterodactyle.\r\n\r\nAmong reptiles, the bone may be compared with lizards and crocodiles.\r\nIn crocodiles the proximal and distal ends are nearly in the same\r\nplane, the distal end has two condyles, the head is convex from side to\r\nside, and the radial crest is moderately developed and never extends so\r\nfar outward or so far proximally as in Pterodactyle. In the Chameleon\r\nthe bone is more twisted than in Crocodile, and as in Pterodactyle\r\nthe distal end is compressed on the radial side to a sharp margin.\r\nIn Iguana, Scink, and Monitor both proximal and distal ends are much\r\nexpanded, and the radial process makes no approximation to that of a\r\nPterodactyle.\r\n\r\nThe bird humerus does not approximate more closely in form to that\r\nof the Pterodactyle than does the Chameleon humerus, though it has\r\nthe cardinal distinction of pneumatic foramina, and these sometimes\r\ncorresponding in position in the two groups.\r\n\r\nThe bird humerus is commonly longer, though in the parrots the\r\nproportions and straightness are not unlike Pterodactyle. In\r\nsome respects a nearer resemblance is seen in the raptorial bird\r\n_Gypogeranus serpentarius_, in which the radial process is rather more\r\ndeveloped than in the Crocodile, and extends further proximally though\r\nstill much smaller than in Pterodactyle; here too the superior surface\r\nis concave from side to side, and the distal articulation is not unlike\r\nthat of some Pterodactyles. But no Pterodactyle has the head of the\r\nhumerus convex from the radial to the ulnar sides, and the bird is\r\ndistinctive in having the ulnar crest developed on the inferior side\r\nof the head: a faint approximation to a similar development is seen in\r\nCrocodile, but there is no trace of such a process in Pterodactyle. The\r\ndistal end is more Bird-like than Lacertian in form, but is twisted to\r\na greater angle with the proximal end than in birds.\r\n\r\nAltogether the bone is distinctive. The points in which it is unlike\r\nbirds and reptiles are those in which Birds and Lizards resemble each\r\nother; it would not be easy to say that in form it resembles one group\r\nmore than the other. But it is linked with birds by the pneumatic\r\nforamina.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIUS AND ULNA.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _a_      9       5- 6\r\n                 10       1-10\r\n                 11       1- 7\r\n                 12       1- 4\r\n                 13       5- 6\r\n\r\nOf neither of these bones has a perfect specimen been found. While\r\nfragments of humeri are met with frequently, fragments of these bones\r\nare rare. In accordance with the analogy with birds the Ulna might\r\nbe presumed to be the larger bone of the two. But from a study of\r\nGerman specimens the larger bone is found to be the Radius, which\r\naccording to the mammalian plan is placed in front of the ulna. As a\r\nwhole, the fore-arm of Ornithosaurians is only to be compared with the\r\ninsectivorous mammal _Chrysochloris Capensis_, in which there are also\r\nthree bones in the fore-arm,--the third bone like the _Pteroid bone_\r\nin Ornithosaurians, extending about half-way from the carpus to the\r\nhumerus, and holding, relatively, a similar position and development to\r\nthe fibula in bats.\r\n\r\nThe pteroid bone articulated with a separate carpal, and was placed\r\non the side of the arm, adjacent to the radius, which at the distal\r\nend extended in German specimens more inward than the ulna. In\r\nChrysochloris the third bone appears to be behind the other bones, and\r\nadjacent to the ulna[P].\r\n\r\n[Footnote P: See D'Alton and Pander _Chiropteren und Insectivoren_,\r\nBonn, 1831, pl. 5, Chrysochloris.]\r\n\r\nAmong neither birds nor reptiles is any comparable modification of\r\nthe fore-arm to be found. Then by examining the proximal surface of\r\nthe proximal carpal, the characters of the distal end of the Radius\r\nare readily discovered. The proximal carpal shows on the same surface\r\nanother articular facets with which however only one fragmentary distal\r\nend of a bone corresponds. That accordingly is identified as the ulna.\r\nBesides these, three other articular ends of bones occur, one of which\r\nfits on to the distal end of the femur. The remaining two are both\r\nlarge bones, with epiphyses which formed portions of the articular\r\nsurfaces, and are usually wanting. One of these bones corresponds in\r\nform with the ulna of a bird, and would fit the facet on the ulnar\r\nside of the distal end of the Pterodactyle humerus. The other bone\r\nis massive with a sub-quadrate articular end, and might well be the\r\nproximal end of the radius. Some specimens are among the largest\r\nfragments of Pterodactyle bone known. The only other bone that either\r\nof these could be is the distal end of the tibia, a bone not yet known,\r\nbut probably not unlike that of a bird.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Distal End of Ulna.\r\n\r\nFour specimens which show articular ends such as the ulna should have,\r\nare mounted together. They are compressed bones with the section of\r\nthe fracture elongately oval; and the shaft widens from the fracture\r\nto the articulation without increasing in thickness. The outer surface\r\nis gently convex, becoming concave mesially near the articulation;\r\nthe inner surface has the same characters, only the concavity at the\r\nextreme distal end reaches from side to side of the bone. The two short\r\nsides both look outward as well as laterally; one of them flattened so\r\nas to thicken the bone, is concave in vertical outline owing to the\r\nextreme distal end turning suddenly outward; the other side a little\r\nconvex, compresses the bone and inflects its inner margin. The longest\r\nspecimen measures 1-5/8 inch; 5/8 inch wide at the fracture, and 1-1/8\r\ninch wide at the distal end. The greatest thickness at the distal end\r\nis half an inch, the thickness of the fractured shaft is 5/8 of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe articular surface appears to have an elongated sub-reniform shape,\r\nthe part at the compressed side of the bone being narrower than the\r\nbroad ovate part on the thick side of the bone, to the lateral limit\r\nof which it extends, while the narrow part does not extend laterally\r\nnearly so far as the inflected border, which appears to give attachment\r\nto powerful muscles. There is also a strong muscular attachment at the\r\ncorresponding diagonal corner of the bone where the outer surface on\r\nits right meets the side of the bone in an elevated ridge.\r\n\r\nIn its long diameter the articulation is a little convex; transversely\r\nit is very convex in the ovate part, but more flattened in its narrower\r\ncontinuation. Where widest it measures about 4/10ths of an inch.\r\n\r\nNos. 5 and 6 on another tablet appear to be distal ends of ulna of\r\nanother kind of Pterodactyle. They are less compressed, more quadrate\r\nin section, and have the sides more nearly parallel The flattened\r\nside similarly has a concave border, but instead of having its distal\r\ntermination developed laterally, has it thickened behind. The opposite\r\nside of the bone which in the other specimens was compressed is here\r\nthick and well rounded, and not at all inflected. There is an absence\r\nof the concavity noticed on the outer surface of the bone in the\r\ncompressed specimens. The articular surface is much flatter, and a\r\nlittle concave in length instead of being convex; as in the other\r\nexamples it looks downward. The largest fragment. No. 5, measures 1-3/8\r\ninch long; it is 6/8 inch wide at the fracture, and 4/8 inch thick. The\r\nsub-quadrate distal end is more than an inch long, more than 4/8ths\r\ninch thick on the thick side, and nearly 4/8ths inch thick on the\r\ncompressed side.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Distal End of Radius.\r\n\r\nThe best preserved of the 10 specimens here exhibited is 3 inches long,\r\nNo. 2. The shaft is oval, flattened on one side; measuring at an inch\r\nfrom the fractured end 7/10ths of an inch in the least diameter, and\r\none inch in the wide diameter. It widens distally at first slowly,\r\nthen rapidly, till at the articular end its greatest width is two\r\ninches. But while expanding laterally it contracts from side to side,\r\nthe more convex side of the two at about an inch from the articular\r\nend, beginning to approximate to the flatter side till the articular\r\nend has a short diameter of less than half an inch.\r\n\r\nOn the left-hand corner of the convex inner side of the bone is an\r\nelevated flattened disc for muscular attachments, fully half an inch\r\nin diameter, there is a slight muscular attachment interior to this,\r\nnearer the middle of the bone. The left-hand corner of the flattened\r\nouter side of the distal end of the radius is marked by a vertical\r\nridge bordering a similarly elevated oval muscular attachment. Parallel\r\nto this nearer the middle of the side is a much stronger and acutely\r\nelevated ridge.\r\n\r\nThe articulation is made up of three distinct parts, all in a straight\r\nline. The portion of bone adjacent to the large muscular disc is\r\ncompressed and rounded on the distal end; then first there is a rather\r\ndeep circular cup 3/8ths of an inch wide, nearer to the more convex\r\nthan to the flatter side of the bone; adjacent to this cup is a convex\r\nball of about the same size; while the remainder of the articulation\r\nis concave in length, convex from side to side, and looks downward and\r\na little towards the inner convex side of the bone. The specimens are\r\narranged so as to display these characters.--The example described is\r\nof nearly the same size as that figured for the humerus in fig. 1, T.\r\nXXIV. of the Cretaceous Reptilia. The less well preserved bone in that\r\nfigure exhibits the Ulna in its true position behind the Radius.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Proximal End of Ulna.\r\n\r\nThis bone has much the proportions of the Ulna in birds, the smaller\r\nspecimens nearly resembling the ulna of the Heron. The specimen (No.\r\n1) with the shaft best preserved is 2-1/4 inches long, cylindrical at\r\nthe fracture, where it measures in diameter 3/16ths of an inch. It\r\ngradually enlarges proximally widening to about 7/10ths of an inch;\r\nnear the proximal end it is a little curved, the side which is concave\r\nin length being a little flattened, while there is a lateral elevation\r\non the opposite side, apparently corresponding to the quill-ridge on\r\nthe convex side of the bird-ulna. There is a separate ossification for\r\nthe olecranon, which is an irregular sub-oblong bone forming the outer\r\npart of the articulation; it is only preserved in No. 1. Nos. 4, 5 and\r\n6 show the concave transverse groove from which it has come away.\r\n\r\nThe articular surface looks upward and forward, in which aspect it has\r\na trapezoidal form. Sometimes, as in No. 2, the great sigmoid area is\r\ndivided into two parts by a vertical ridge, the more elevated part\r\nof the articulation on the radial side of the bone being concave,\r\nwhile the outer part, as in the heron, besides being concave, has its\r\nborder on the concave side of the bone produced and rounded. There is\r\na small triangular elevation on the radial aspect of the proximal end\r\nlike that on the corresponding part of the ulna of the heron. On this\r\naspect the bone is flattened, on the opposite and outward aspect it is\r\ncompressed and produced as in the bird. No. 2 measures 1-1/8 inch over\r\nthe articular end. The series includes 6 specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Proximal End of Radius.\r\n\r\nThis bone terminated in an epiphysis which formed part of the articular\r\nsurface, and has disappeared from all the 7 specimens mounted. So much\r\nof the articulation as remains does not oppose the idea of its having\r\nbeen attached to the humerus, while the large size of the example No.\r\n7, which could not have measured less than 2-1/2 inches from side to\r\nside over the articulation, is more in accordance with what is at\r\npresent known of the dimensions attained by the distal end of the\r\nhumerus than with the size that would be expected in the distal end\r\nof the tibia, which is the only other unknown bone to which these\r\nspecimens could be referred.\r\n\r\nThe longest specimen, No. 3, is 3 inches long; broadly ovate at the\r\nfracture, measuring in the long diameter 1 inch, and in the short\r\ndiameter more than 3/4ths of an inch. Nearer the articular end the bone\r\nbecomes in section sub-quadrate or rather sub-rhomboid. No. 1 shows\r\nthese terminal characters extremely well. On the posterior aspect of\r\nthe specimen the surface is divided into two flattened slightly convex\r\nparts by a median vertical well-rounded angular bend. In front the side\r\nis similarly divided into two parts, both of them a little concave\r\nproximally, by a sharp median vertical ridge, which does not reach to\r\nthe articulation by a varying distance, never so long as the bone is\r\nwide. The ridge terminates in, and is pierced by, a vertical groove\r\napparently for a nutritive vessel. Where the anterior and posterior\r\naspects of the bone converge laterally the sides are well rounded.\r\n\r\nOnly a small part of the articular surface is preserved, looking upward\r\nand a little forward; it terminates the wider of the halves of the\r\nbone laterally and in front. The remainder of the articular surface,\r\nfrom which the epiphysis has come away, may be divided principally in\r\nthe majority of specimens into a posterior flattened median rhomboid\r\nspace and an oblong cup-shaped anterior space divided from it by an\r\nelevated ridge. The extreme lateral termination appears to have been a\r\nball-shaped convexity.\r\n\r\nThe great length of the fore-arm relatively to the humerus,\r\ncharacteristic of German Ornithosaurians, from the fragmentary\r\ncondition of Cambridge specimens is not seen.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fore-arm resembles Chrysochloris in _plan_ the\r\nresemblance is not close in the details of form. In many Mammals it is\r\ncharacteristic for the radius to be the principal bone of the fore-arm,\r\nand among Ruminants in which this is especially the case the radius is\r\naltogether in front and the ulna behind as is the position with Birds\r\nand Crocodiles. And among mammals with claws, as in the Lion, Bear,\r\n&c., and in the Chameleon, it is characteristic, for the radius also to\r\nbe on the inside of the limb at the distal end, as in Ornithosaurians.\r\nIn form, ridges, and muscular attachments (see pl. 3) the distal end of\r\nthe radius approximates closely to the Bear and the Lion, and may also\r\nbe compared with the Bats and Birds, though with Birds it is a small\r\nbone. From the epiphysis of the proximal end apparently being wanting\r\nit would be difficult to compare closely. But though not like any\r\nparticular mammal, it might have pertained to a mammal since it has the\r\nlarge perforation for the nutritive vessel near to the proximal end as\r\nin the Camel and many of the mammalia.\r\n\r\nThe ulna of the Pterodactyles is at the proximal end altogether\r\ndistinguished from mammals by the slight development of the olecranon,\r\nnor can the distal end, especially in its relation to the carpus, be\r\nparalleled.\r\n\r\nAmong birds and reptiles the ulna is the large bone, and here a\r\ngeneral resemblance in form to the ulna of Pterodactyles is seen at\r\nthe proximal end. It is not compressed from side to side as in the\r\nCrocodile, Iguana, Monitor, &c., but from back to fronts in this\r\nrather resembling Birds than the Chameleon. It however at the distal\r\nend is more crocodilian.\r\n\r\nThe fore-arm in plan is mammalian. The Pteroid bone is mammalian, the\r\nRadius is mammalian and avian; the Ulna is avian, and crocodilian in\r\nform, but mammalian in proportion. The pneumatic foramen of the ulna is\r\npeculiarly avian.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CARPUS.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 5.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _b_   1     1-13\r\n               2     1-18\r\n               3     1- 4\r\n               4     1- 8\r\n\r\nThe pterodactyle wrist is made up of three bones, arranged as a\r\nproximal carpal, a distal carpal, and a lateral carpal. Two of them\r\nare figured by Professor Owen, who regarded the distal carpal of\r\nthis description as the scapho-cuneiform; while A very imperfect\r\nexample of the proximal carpal is named the unciform: neither of these\r\ndeterminations, the reverse of those which follow, were given as more\r\nthan probable guesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Proximal Carpal.\r\n\r\nNo. 10 shows the proximal surface well; portions of it are seen in\r\nNos. 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12. The distal surface is best exhibited\r\nin No. 1; portions of it are shown in Nos. 2, 3, 5, 7, 8. No. 13 is an\r\nimpression taken from the proximal sur&ce of a distal carpal to show\r\nits correspondence with distal surface of the proximal carpal. The\r\nbone is proximally of an irregular oblong form, being five sided, and\r\nmuch broader towards the inner end than towards the outer end. The two\r\nends are sub-parallel, and rather obliquely connected on one side by\r\na nearly straight border more than twice as long as the shorter end.\r\nThe other limits of the sub-parallel ends are connected by two concave\r\nborders meeting in a well rounded convexity, which is near to the\r\nbroader inner end.\r\n\r\nThe proximal surface of the bone is flattened, and may be divided into\r\na sub-rhomboid space, adjacent to the shorter of the sub-parallel ends,\r\nwhich is moderately concave in the long axis of the bone and slightly\r\nconvex transversely, and an oblong space adjacent to the longer of\r\nthe two ends. This is separated from the sub-rhomboid space, toward\r\nthe straight side of the bone, by an elevated ridge sub-parallel\r\nwith the ends. It is directed towards the convexity on the opposite\r\nside, in which the long and short concave parts meet, but after half\r\ncrossing the bone it becomes forked in a U shape, and less elevated;\r\nthe smooth unarticular included space shows an oval pneumatic foramen,\r\nwhich varies in size with the different species. The region between\r\nthis Y-shaped ridge and the longer of the two ends, is sub-reniform,\r\nslightly concave in its long diameter, and deeply concave in the short\r\ndiameter, exactly corresponding in form with the articular surface\r\nalready described as the distal end of the ulna. Also parallel with\r\nthe long end of the bone are marks of an articular surface exactly\r\ncorresponding with those described as the distal end of the radius;\r\nthat is, at the convex angle of the angulated side is placed a\r\nhemispherical boss,' interior to which is a hemispherical concavity,\r\nand extending toward the straight side is the oblique smooth border\r\nof the sub-rhomboid area described. There still remains a space to be\r\naccounted for. This consists of a sub-quadrate area forming the corner\r\nof the bone made by the concave side and the shorter outer end; it is\r\nmade up of an inner concave part separated from the radial articulation\r\nby a ridge, and an outer convex part constituting the shorter end of\r\nthe bone.\r\n\r\nThis carpal is moderately compressed from the proximal to the distal\r\nside, except towards the shorter end of the bone, being there prolonged\r\ndistally into a wedge-shaped process, showing at its termination marks\r\nof a powerful muscular attachment.\r\n\r\nThe outer lateral surface is of variable antero-posterior extent.\r\n\r\nThe distal articular surface is placed entirely toward the narrow\r\nend of the bone, leaving at the proximal end a large smooth rhomboid\r\nunarticular area, of which every side is a little concave: it connects\r\nobliquely the proximal with the distal articular surfaces. The distal\r\narticular area is divided by a diagonal ridge into a long oblong area\r\nof which the inner and outer sides are sub-parallel and the ends\r\nrounded: it is slightly concave in length as well as transversely, and\r\nis slightly twisted like the flukes of a screw. Adjacent to this region\r\nlaterally is the other and sub-triangular part of the articulation.\r\nThe broad end of the triangle is toward the broad end of the bone; it\r\nis concave in length and flattened transversely. The two parts of the\r\narticulation are inclined to each other at a large angle, both looking\r\ndownward and outward, but on opposite sides of the bone.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Distal Carpal.\r\n\r\nThe tablets of this bone comprise 22 specimens. Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\r\n8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 19 and 22 are so mounted as to exhibit the proximal\r\nsurface. Nos. 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 and 21 show the distal\r\nsurface of the bone. No. 17 is a cast from the distal sur&ce of a\r\nproximal carpal for comparison with the proximal surface of the distal\r\ncarpal. No. 16 is a cast from the proximal end of the wing-metacarpal\r\nfor comparison with the distal surface of the distal carpal. No. 20\r\nis a distal carpal of unusual type, 19 is a cast from its proximal\r\nsurface, and 21 is a cast from the distal surface of the same specimen.\r\n\r\nThe proximal aspect of this bone is rather narrower than the distal\r\naspect; each is sub-triangular in outline, the sides being convexly\r\ncurved. In the long axis from the apex on the inside to the short\r\nouter[Q] side the bone is convex proximally with an oblique transverse\r\ndepression; in the short axis, that is, between the two longer sides,\r\nthe middle of the bone is hollow, but the oblique transverse depression\r\nmakes both sides of the hollow convex,--so that excepting the smooth\r\nunarticular triangular area adjacent to the apex, the sub-quadrate\r\narticular surface is shaped somewhat like two cones put side by side\r\nin such manner that the apex of each touches the base of the other:\r\nthe apex of that cone which should touch the short side or base of\r\nthe triangle formed by the bone, is truncated by a depression which\r\nexhibits an oval pneumatic foramen. Towards the apex, on the same side\r\nas the pneumatic foramen, the margin of the bone is rounded for a small\r\nterminal oval articulation which looks outward and upward.\r\n\r\n[Footnote Q: Outer and inner are here used in accordance with the usual\r\ninterpretation, and the better to compare with birds.]\r\n\r\nThe lateral aspects of the bone are at right angles to the proximal and\r\ndistal surfaces. They are smooth, a little concave in antero-posterior\r\nextent, and convex in the opposite direction. That one on to which\r\nthe marginal articular surface impinges is except for that surface\r\nsub-quadrate in outline; the opposite side has a slightly crescentic\r\nform, the flattened outline being distal. They show several small\r\nforamina.\r\n\r\nThe distal aspect of the bone is comparatively flat. The distal surface\r\nconsists of a smooth unarticular part adjacent to the apex, rather\r\nsmaller than the corresponding area on the proximal aspect of the bone.\r\nBetween this part and the sub-crescentic articular surface, which\r\noccupies the remainder of the distal area, is a large circular pit,\r\nfurthest removed from the side of the bone which forms the sub-apical\r\nmarginal articulation. The pit on the apical side shows several small\r\nforamina; on the outer side of the bone the roughened articular\r\nsurface extends down the pit side. The articulation is flattened from\r\nside to side of the bone. Its outer margin is slightly prominent, and\r\nthe margin of the pit is slightly convex and prominent, so that the\r\nintervening articular surface in the direction between these limits\r\nis concave. It is commonly divided into two parts by a median band\r\nlimiting a depressed half, which is in a slightly different plane\r\nfrom the other half of the articulation. Where the depressed part\r\nterminates towards the marginal articulation, which does not extend\r\nso far distally, there is between the two a small step-like roughened\r\narticular portion.\r\n\r\nThe large crescentic articulation described gave attachment to the\r\nwing-metacarpal bone; if there was a second metacarpal terminating\r\nin a claw, it must have been attached to the small articulation last\r\nreferred to. In No. 20 the pit is extremely small, the impressed part\r\nof the articulation is small and deeply sunk, while the apicular\r\narticulation is widened and shortened so as to make the outline of the\r\nbone quadrate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Lateral Carpal.\r\n\r\nThe tablet exhibits eight examples of a bone which at its distal end is\r\nattached to the marginal apicular articulation of the distal carpal,\r\nthence extending proximally, and terminating in an articular facet for\r\nthe third bone of the fore-arm, so as to overlap laterally both of the\r\nother carpals. The bone is compressed, is three times as wide as thick,\r\nand in outline sub-quadrate with a distal talon. On the inner side it\r\nis flat, and on the outer side above the talon it is concave vertically\r\nand convex transversely in such way that the side of the bone to which\r\nthe distal articulation is adjacent is thicker than the other side,\r\nand sometimes bent at a sharp angle. The talon on the inner aspect of\r\nthe bone is flat and continuous with the quadrate side, but on the\r\nouter aspect it is separated from the side by an elevated transverse\r\nthickening, distally to which the bone is compressed, and rounded into\r\nthe adjacent parts. The talon extends over more than half of the distal\r\nend of the bone, and constitutes with the remainder of the distal end,\r\nthe distal articulation, which is flat from front to back, and concave\r\nfrom side to base. The proximal articulation is cupped and extends over\r\nthe whole proximal surface; it is at right angles with the sides of the\r\nbone. Both the inner and outer sides exhibit small pneumatic foramina.\r\nNo. 8 differs from the other specimens in its sub-triangular lateral\r\noutline, and general less complex modifications.\r\n\r\nThe Carpus of the Cambridge Ornithosaurians at first sight is not\r\neasily compared with that of Birds; Birds having but one bone between\r\nthe radius and the metacarpus. But that one bone in the Ostrich, for\r\ninstance, is not unlike in form to the proximal carpal of Pterodactyle;\r\nwhile the proximal end of the metacarpus presents so close an analogy\r\nwith the distal carpal of the Pterodactyle, that even were it not\r\neasily demonstrated that the bone in Birds commonly called the\r\nmetacarpus is a carpo-metacarpus[R], it would be strong evidence for\r\nsuch a determination. In Birds there is a small lateral bone between\r\nthe ulna and carpo-metacarpus which is evidently homologous with the\r\nlateral carpal of our Pterodactyles, and so, since this lateral carpal\r\nof the Ostrich is the pisiform bone, it results that the lateral\r\ncarpal of Pterodactyle is the pisiform bone also. From this follows a\r\nconclusion of the first importance in the interpretation of the hand.\r\nThe fine hair-like metacarpals of the Pterodactyle are on the side\r\ntowards the pisiform bone, while the great wing-metacarpal is on the\r\nside towards the index finger.\r\n\r\n[Footnote R: They separate without difficulty in the Chicken.]\r\n\r\nIn Birds the rudimentary thumb (or second finger, according to Owen)\r\nhas no connection with the carpus. In the Penguin, _Aptenodytes\r\nPatagonica_, it has disappeared altogether, and there then remain two\r\nfingers of which the outer one (seen from the front as we have placed\r\nour animal) is the larger, and has the greatest number of phalanges,\r\nprecisely as in Ornithosaurians. Moreover the wing-metacarpal, in the\r\nPenguin especially, is seen to unite with the carpus directly under the\r\nradius, as is the case with the Cambridge Ornithosaurians. Hence it\r\nfollows that in Pterodactyles the thumb is not developed, and that the\r\nwing-finger is not the little finger, but the index finger, precisely\r\nas in Birds. If Goldfuss gave a reverse arrangement it was because the\r\nhand in his specimen, as is proved by the claws, was upside down. In\r\nthe immature state the distal carpal of Pterodactyle appears to have\r\nbeen composite.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the opinions of eminent German philosophers to\r\nthe contrary no reptile has a carpus comparable to that of the\r\nPterodactyle. If some of them have two rows of bones and a pisiform\r\nbone, so have mammals, and the mammalian arrangement is not more like\r\nthe Ornithosauria than is that in Reptiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n  METACARPAL BONE.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 6.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _b_     5      1-3\r\n\r\nThe illustrations of this bone comprise 31 specimens. Nos. 1 to 15\r\nare examples of the proximal end, and Nos. 16 to 31 show the distal\r\ntrochlear end of the bone. No. 1, which is nearly entire, gives the\r\nform and proportions of the wing-metacarpal in one species, but a\r\nknowledge of its variableness in German forms would guard against an\r\nassumption that all the other Greensand species were to be restored\r\non the plan of this example. It is 3-5/8 inches long, to which\r\nthree-eighths of an inch may be added for the distal articulation,\r\nmaking the length up to 4 inches. The proximal end is not well\r\npreserved, but in its wide measurement is 5/8ths of an inch; the distal\r\nend in the same measurement is about 3/8ths of an inch. A large example\r\nfrom the Chalk, in the Museum of C. Moore Esq. of Bath, shows the bone\r\nmore attenuated distally. No. 1 is compressed so as to be oblong in\r\nsection at the proximal end, and ovate in the middle of the shaft,\r\nwhich is slightly smaller than the distal end. One of the lateral\r\noutlines is straight; the other is concave. The bone is straight. In\r\nNo. 30 the shaft where thickest measures less than 1/4 of an inch,\r\nbecoming nearly circular in section. The shaft of No. 31 measures\r\nnearly an inch in width at its distal end, rather more than half an\r\ninch in thickness. No. 10 is 1-1/2 inch wide at the proximal end and\r\n7/8ths of an inch thick. No. 9 would not have measured less when\r\nperfect than 2-1/2 inches over the proximal end, so that if it had the\r\nproportions of No. 1 it would have measured when entire not less than\r\n16 inches in length.\r\n\r\nThe Proximal End.\r\n\r\nThe proximal end has never been figured. Prof. Owen's figure pl. IV.\r\nfig, 4-5, First Supt. Cret. Rep. is probably part of a jaw, and not\r\nthe wing-metacarpal. The articular surface is oblong with one corner\r\nrounded off so that the adjacent long and short sides become confluent\r\non the exterior surface of the bone.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the flat inside margin and extending proximally is\r\na semi-cylindrical process, which is prolonged a short distance down\r\nthe side of the bone as an elevated ridge. On the flattened articular\r\nend this process is bordered by a semicircular furrow which extends\r\nhalf-way across the bone, outside of which is a slightly convex\r\nsemicircular band which extends to the outer margin of the bone,\r\nexcept towards the short side opposite to that one which rounds into\r\nthe outer side, where there appears to be a narrow unarticular area.\r\nOn the inside of the bone where the two ends of the semicircular\r\nproximal furrow terminate are two deep grooves which extend a short\r\ndistance distally; they are both limited by inward extensions of the\r\nshort sides of the bone, that crest being most developed in height and\r\nlength which is toward the flattened short side. The outline which\r\nthese modifications give to the inner side of the proximal surface\r\nis intermediate in form between the letters S and [sideways M].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Distal End.\r\n\r\nThe distal end has been figured by Prof. Owen in the British Fossil\r\nMammals, p. 545; in Dixon's Geology of Sussex, Pl. XXIX. fig. 12; Cret.\r\nReptiles, Pl. XXXII. figs. 4 and 5, First Supt. Pl. IV, fig. 9-11, and\r\nother places, and fully described. It closely resembles the distal end\r\nof a bird's tibia; and consists of a pulley-shaped end set obliquely\r\non to the compressed shaft, which just above the junction is reniform\r\nin section, owing to the development of _a median rounded ridge_ on\r\nthe same inner side of the bone which bears the median ridge at the\r\nproximal end, while on the opposite side there is a corresponding\r\n_median depression_ which does not extend far proximally. In this\r\ndepression is an oval pneumatic foramen; on the right of the median\r\nridge of the other side, but placed more distally, is another pneumatic\r\nforamen. The median ridge has sometimes a slight furrow on each side.\r\nIt terminates proximally in strong muscular insertions, which extend\r\nround the right side of the bone; and distally, becoming more elevated\r\nand rounded, it curves obliquely to the rights and forming one of the\r\nsides of the pulley, passes round the base as three quarters of a\r\nspiral, the termination extending laterally beyond the shaft. On this\r\nside of the bone, distal to the median depression, arises another ridge\r\nstrong and well rounded, which is directed to the right, similarly\r\npasses round the base as a spiral, and forms the other side of the\r\npulley. It is not so prominent as the border previously described.\r\nWhile the spirals approximate at their origin, they become widely\r\nseparated at the base, making the articulation wider than the shaft. In\r\nNo. 31 the three inches of the shaft which remain show both pairs of\r\nits sides sub-parallel; the widest measures nearly an inch; the base of\r\nthe articulation is less than a quarter of an inch wider.\r\n\r\nLimited to the base, between the two outer ridges of the pulley, is\r\na short median ridge slightly developed; so as to flatten the middle\r\nof the concavity between the ridges, and divide it into two grooves.\r\nThe degree to which the middle ridge is developed varies in different\r\nspecies. In No. 30, the smallest pterodactyle, remarkable for a long\r\nwing-metacarpal bone, it is not to be detected. The exterior sides of\r\nthe trochlear articulation are broad, flattened, and a little concave.\r\n\r\nThere is some variation in the way in which the shaft is set on the\r\ntrochlear end. It being often in the middle, but not unfrequently\r\ninclined more to one side than to the other.\r\n\r\nThe metacarpus finds no close parallel among living animals. The\r\nthread-like metacarpal bones suggest the condition of the hind-foot\r\nin the Kangaroo. The predominant metacarpal suggests the ruminants.\r\nBut the nearest approximation is found among birds where the bone\r\nfor the middle finger is large and the bone for the third finger is\r\nslender. This may be observed (among other examples) in the Penguin\r\nand the Swan. But here the parallel ends. The proximal end in Birds,\r\nwe have already seen to be hidden by the anchylosed distal row of the\r\ncarpus, and the distal end though often convex from side to side never\r\npresents the trochlear joint of the Pterodactyle. Consequently so far\r\nas regards the form of the articular ends the resemblance is closer\r\nwith Reptiles and clawed Mammals than with Birds. In Birds the small\r\nmetacarpal is usually of similar length with the large one as is the\r\ncase with Pterodactyles.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FIRST PHALANGE.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 7.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _b_     6      1-10\r\n\r\nNo perfect specimen of the first phalange has been found in the\r\nCambridge Greensand. Ten bones are mounted to illustrate it, all of\r\nthem less perfect than others in the series of associated bones. No.\r\n1 shows the heel of the proximal end; Nos. 9 and 10 are portions of\r\nthe proximal articulation from which the epiphysis which forms the\r\narticular heel-part seen in No. 1 has come away. Nos. 2 to 8 are the\r\ndistal articular ends of first phalanges. It is improbable that any of\r\nthem belong to the second phalange, since they agree in form, and show\r\nmuscular attachments which correspond.\r\n\r\nProf. Owen has figured the shaft of a fine example of this bone in\r\nDixon's Geology of Sussex, Pl. XXXIX. fig. 11. A good proximal end is\r\nshown in Pl. XXXII. fig. 2, of Prof. Owen's monograph of the Cretaceous\r\nReptilia, but the figure appears to have been previously given in Pl.\r\nXXIV. fig. 2 of the same monograph. By far the grandest specimens are\r\ndrawn in Pl. XXX. Prof. Owen names these wing bones. In the \"Literature\r\nof English Pterodactyles\" the loss of the proximal epiphysis from the\r\nspecimen represented in Prof Owen's fig. 1 and 2 led me to interpret\r\nthe bone as an ulna. Figs. 1 to 4 represent the proximal ends and\r\ngreater portions of the shafts of first phalanges. The lower bone\r\nin fig. 5 is neither radius nor ulna, as stated in the text of the\r\nCretaceous Reptilia, but the shaft and distal end of a first phalange;\r\nthe upper bone being the second phalange.\r\n\r\nThe Proximal End.\r\n\r\nThe straight shaft throughout its length is triangular in section. One\r\nside of the bone is gently convex; this may be named for convenience\r\nthe outside. The two parts which make up the other side are inclined,\r\nand have the angle in which they meet rounded; one part looks upward\r\nand inward, the other downward and inward. Towards the proximal end the\r\nbone widens and thickens, and the moiety of the inner side which is\r\naway from the heel becomes cleft, and has the sides of the depression\r\nrounded to form a large pneumatic foramen. The articular surface looks\r\nupward and a little outward on the side of the pneumatic foramen.\r\nIt consists of two semicircular concave grooves, separated by an\r\nintervening low convexity. The outer of these grooves extends from the\r\nmargin of the extreme proximal point of the heel to the widest point\r\nof the bone; the other groove more deeply concave, is a third shorter,\r\nextending from inside the pneumatic foramen to the heel. Here both\r\ngrooves converge, terminating in a point, exterior to which a little\r\ndistally is a hemispherical mammilate eminence. On the distal side of\r\nthe eminence there is a depression so as to make the angle behind the\r\nheel almost hemispherically rounded. This articulation fits on to the\r\ndistal articulation of the wing-metacarpal.\r\n\r\nWhen the proximal epiphysis forming the heel comes away, it leaves a\r\nlarge sub-circular pit with a depressed narrow border.\r\n\r\nDistal End.\r\n\r\nOn nearing the distal end, the angle of the inner side of the shaft\r\nbecomes more depressed; and the articulation becomes an elongated oval,\r\nslightly convex transversely and convex in length so as to extend\r\ndistally in a curve in such way that the articulation looks downward\r\nand outward from an aspect of the bone exactly opposite to the aspect\r\nfrom which the proximal articulation looks upward and inward. Hence\r\nthe two articular surfaces are sub-parallel; but the distal one at\r\nits distal termination is bent inward, so as to make the adjacent\r\nlateral outline of the bone concave on the inside at its termination.\r\nThe articulation does not cover the most proximal part of the distal\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SECOND PHALANGE.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 7.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _b_     7      1-14\r\n\r\nOn this tablet are mounted 14 specimens. Nos. 1 to 9 are examples of\r\nthe proximal end of the second phalange. If there were more than two\r\nphalanges, of which there is no osteological evidence, it is possible\r\nthat proximal ends of succeeding phalanges may be included with these.\r\nThey all however resemble each, other so closely as to lend no support\r\nto such a supposition. Nos. ?10 to ?14 have been mounted with the\r\nproximal ends because they appear to be portions of the middle of the\r\nshaft of the second phalange; they indicate a rapid distal attenuation,\r\nfavouring the idea of there being but two phalanges.\r\n\r\nThe proximal end of the shaft has the outer side flattened, rarely\r\nconcave, commonly slightly convex; the inner side being much more\r\ninflated, and not dissimilar in form to the inner side of the first\r\nphalange. Proximally the bone widens and one lateral outline extends\r\noutward in a curve, on the inner side of which, under the proximal\r\narticulation, is placed the pneumatic foramen. The elongated oval\r\narticular surface is concave from side to side and concave in length;\r\nit does not extend in length so far as the straight side outline,\r\nexterior to it being a crescentic flattened or convex area. The distal\r\nend attenuates more rapidly in some specimens than others, and appears\r\nin Nos. 11, 12, and 14 eventually to become cylindrical; but none of\r\nthe specimens show its distal termination.\r\n\r\nThe phalanges of the wing-finger attain a grand development in length\r\nwhich is not paralleled in Birds, nor surpassed in Bats. In the Ostrich\r\nthere are three phalanges in the wing-finger, while in Ornithopterus\r\nthere are two joints, and in other German Pterodactyles four joints.\r\nThe terminal joint in the Ostrich is a claw, but in Pterodactyle the\r\nterminal joint appears to be unarmed as in ordinary birds. The form of\r\nthe bones in being compressed from side to side is more bird-like than\r\nbat-like. But the claws in their compression from side to side are more\r\nlike the bat than the bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DISTAL END OF METACARPAL\r\n\r\n  or Metatarsal Bones.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 6.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _b_     7      1-14\r\n\r\nSub-cylindrical bones, apparently elongated, and a little compressed\r\nobliquely, terminating distally in a slightly expanded trochlear\r\narticulation. Some of them show on one side marks of an osseous\r\nadhesion: this has led to their being regarded as claw metacarpals\r\nrather than as the distal ends of tibiæ. But on the supposition of\r\ntheir being claw metacarpals, they are as compared with the same bones\r\nin _Pt. Suevicus_, out of all proportion large, since wing-metacarpals\r\nfrom the Cambridge Greensand would not as a rule have a diameter\r\nmore than twice that of these bones. The trochlear articulation is\r\nsmaller in proportion to the shaft than in the wing-metacarpal, and\r\nusually shows a pit at the side and grooves above for ligaments; the\r\nmesial pulley groove is shallow and broad. Seven specimens are mounted\r\nin illustration, of which No. 3 may be regarded as doubtful. It is\r\npossible that they may be metatarsals.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CLAW PHALANGE.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 8.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _b_     8      1-3\r\n\r\nThese three sub-triangular bones, which supported the claws, are much\r\ncompressed from side to side, and consequently deep. The superior\r\noutline is convex from front to back and rounded from side to side. The\r\ninferior outline is concave from front to back, sometimes narrower,\r\nsometimes broader than the upper part of the bone, while the inferior\r\naspect is always more flattened than the superior aspect. On each side\r\non the lower half of the bone is a deep groove. The articular end is\r\ndivided into an upper articular part, which extends as far down as the\r\nlateral groove and a lower non-articular part with ligament markings.\r\nThe articulation is concave from above downward, and is divided into\r\ntwo lateral parts by a mesial vertical ridge. The articular end is\r\nabout half as deep as the bone is long.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pelvic Girdle and Hind Limb.\r\n\r\n  OS INNOMINATUM.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 8.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _b_    10      1-9\r\n\r\nNine specimens are mounted in illustration of the pelvic girdle: Nos.\r\n1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 show the acetabular or femoral aspects. The right os\r\ninnominatum is exemplified by Nos. 1, 4 and 5; the left by Nos. 3 and\r\n6. No. 2 shows the sacral aspect of a left ischium, and its attachments\r\nwith the pubis and ilium. No. 8 is the sacral aspect of a left os\r\npubis. No. 9 is the femoral aspect of a right OS pubis. None of the\r\nspecimens are sufficiently complete to give the form of any of the\r\nbones. The only known example of an entire or nearly entire pelvis at\r\nall comparable in form, is seen in the original specimen of Dimorphodon\r\nmacronyx figured by Buckland, _Trans. Geol. Soc._ Ser. 2. vol. III. p.\r\n217. In nearly all the fossils from the Cambridge Greensand the bones\r\nof the pelvis are anchylosed together.\r\n\r\nThe ossa innominata have been determined as right and left on the\r\nsupposition that the pelvis of the Dimorphodon is in situ, and from the\r\ngeneral correspondence of the form of the constituent elements with\r\nelements of the pelvis in the lower mammals, reptiles, and birds.\r\n\r\nEach os innominatum shows a hemispherical acetabulum which is slightly\r\nelongated in antero-posterior extent In the Dimorphodon the bone which\r\nis superior to the cup, that is to say, which extends dorsally along\r\nthe sacral vertebræ is prolonged anteriorly as a strong narrow straight\r\nstyle, the base of which is seen in the parts marked _Ilium_ in Nos.\r\n1 and 6. A more perfect example may be studied in a pelvis from the\r\nCambridge Greensand preserved in the collection of the Geological\r\nsurvey. Posterior to the acetabulum a similar but stronger bony style\r\nextends for more than the length of the acetabulum, curving slightly\r\ndownward at its posterior part. The dorsal outline of this portion of\r\nthe bone is slightly concave. The posterior horn like the anterior\r\nhorn forms part of the ilium which constitutes the upper half of the\r\nacetabular cup. The os innominatum contracts in antero-posterior\r\nextent below the acetabulum, and immediately widens again in a thin\r\nconcave bony expansion. The anterior or pubic outline is comparatively\r\nstraight, and at right angles with the ilium; the posterior or ischiac\r\noutline is deeply cupped where the ischium unites with the ilium, and\r\nbecoming straight extends backward at a considerable angle. The ischium\r\ncontributes less to the pelvic cup than either the ilium or pubis;\r\nit is flat in front and convex on the visceral side, rounding into\r\nthe narrow flattened posterior side. The pubis is separated from the\r\nischium by a suture extending vertically through the obturator foramen.\r\nThe obturator foramen [seen in No. 9] is small and oval, less than half\r\nthe diameter of the acetabulum, situated below its ventral border. It\r\npasses obliquely downward and a little forward, and its opening makes\r\nthe exterior aspect of the pubis concave; the visceral aspect of the\r\npubis is convex from side to side like the ischium. The sacral aspect\r\nof so much of the os innominatum as is seen, is concave from the dorsal\r\nto the ventral margins, and is cupped behind and below the acetabulum,\r\nthe surface being rough. Among reptiles the ilium is chiefly behind\r\nthe acetabulum, in mammals it is chiefly in front. In the over-lapping\r\ngroup, Aves, it extends both ways. Among the Amphibia the ilium is\r\nchiefly anterior to the acetabulum. In Crocodiles it has a slight\r\nextension both ways, in Dinosaurs the extensions are more marked and\r\nthe whole arrangement approximates to birds. But among animals which\r\nhave been affiliated with reptiles the Dicynodonts are the only order\r\nin which there is a pelvis so mammalian and massive. If the ilium of\r\nthe Monotreme genus Echidna had a posterior extension, the pelvis would\r\nbe altogether comparable with the pelvis of this Pterodactyle, and\r\nwould differ chiefly in the larger obturator foramen, the perforated\r\nacetabulum and the unanchylosed condition of the pelvic elements. The\r\npelvis of Apteryx does not make any near approximation.\r\n\r\nMoreover specimens Nos. 3 and 4 show on the anterior pubic border,\r\nabout the base of the acetabulum, a slight pit or roughness to\r\nwhich something has been attached, and in the original specimen of\r\nDimorphodon associated with the pelvis are two triangular bones which\r\nrecall something of the form of the prepubic bones of Echidna. Most\r\nGerman Pterodactyles show on the OS pubis an enormous prepubic bone.\r\nIn Iguana the pubis forms at its anterior border, a sharp angular\r\nprocess. In Chelydra the process is long and narrower, and arises\r\nfrom the middle of the border. In Echidna this prepubic process has\r\nbecome a distinct prepubic bone and is more elongated. Unlike the\r\nmarsupial bones it is attached to the pubis by a wide base. The\r\nanterior pubic roughness of Cambridge specimens, and the loose bones\r\nof the Dimorphodon, &c. indicate the existence of structures in the\r\nOrnithosauria homologous with the prepubic bones of the Ornithodelphia.\r\n\r\nSo far as it is comparable with living animals, the ilium is altogether\r\navian, differing in being narrower; and the pubis and ischium are\r\nmammalian.\r\n\r\nThe upper anterior corner is the most elevated part of the acetabular\r\nborder, as in the great Auk and some birds of vertical position of\r\nbody, and many mammals.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FEMUR.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 8.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _b_    11      1-16\r\n\r\nTwenty-six specimens are mounted to illustrate the Femur. 10 are\r\nproximal ends; 16 distal ends. But in the series illustrative of\r\nspecies is an entire specimen of a right Femur 4 inches long. Fragments\r\nNos. 3 and 12 show proximal and distal ends twice as large, but most of\r\nthe examples are about the size of the entire femur.\r\n\r\nIt is a straight sub-cylindrical bone, flattened in front, a little\r\ncompressed from front to back distally, and (in one type) compressed\r\nproximally from side to side behind. The distal articulation has a\r\nbroad shallow channel passing down from the front and imperfectly\r\nseparating two condyloid parts, which extend a little backward and\r\nare divided behind. The outer condyle extends a little outward, and\r\nso gives the outer side of the bone at the distal end an oblique\r\ncompressed aspect like that which prevails among birds and many\r\nmammals. Proximally the shaft contracts suddenly and is produced\r\nupward, forward, and inward as a rounded neck, as long as in the femur\r\nof any mammalian carnivore, which expands rapidly at the end to form\r\nthe hemispherical ball, which articulates with the pelvic acetabulum.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 shows a well-marked pit for the ligamentum teres at the back part\r\nof the ball. At the proximal end of the shaft below the neck is a large\r\npit for the obturator muscle, and at the outer front angle a great\r\ntrochanter. Proximally the bone can only be compared with the mammalian\r\nCarnivora, Quadrumana and Man; distally it is avian and mammalian.\r\n\r\nIn one genus exemplified by specimens 5-10 the obturator pit is not\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nSometimes the shaft is curved a little convexly, outward and forward.\r\n\r\n  TIBIA.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 8.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _b_    12      1-11\r\n\r\nEleven specimens are mounted to illustrate the tibia, of which 1 to\r\n9 are regarded as proximal ends; and 10, 11 with less confidence are\r\nregarded as distal ends from which the distal epiphysis has come\r\naway. It is to be anticipated that the distal end of the tibia in\r\nPterodactyle will when found approximate to the distal end of the tibia\r\nin the bird.\r\n\r\nThe bone is at the proximal end straight and sub-cylindrical, slowly\r\nenlarging proximally; convex behind, except for an elevated boss some\r\nlittle way below the proximal articulation for the attachment of\r\npowerful muscles. In front the shaft is a little flattened proximally,\r\nwith a mesial groove dividing two prominences which are apparently\r\nhomologous with the ridges below the patella in birds. The proximal\r\narticular surface truncates the shaft at right angles except at what\r\nis regarded as the outer front aspect, where it rises into a small\r\npatelloid prominence.\r\n\r\nIt shows the impressions of two condyles, which correspond in form with\r\nthe distal end of the Femur.\r\n\r\nNos. 3 and 6 are regarded as left tibia; Nos. 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 as examples\r\nof right tibia.\r\n\r\nNo specimen likely to be a fibula has been found. In Dimorphodon and\r\nin German Genera the fibula is Avian in form. The Crocodile offers\r\nsome approximation to the Pterodactyle shape in the proximal end of\r\nthe Tibia, but the Pterodactyle has Avian characters in addition. Its\r\nstraightness and length, ridges on the front and patelloid prominence,\r\nare Avian.\r\n\r\n  TARSUS OR TARSO-METATARSUS.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 8.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _b_    13       1\r\n\r\nThis fragment, which may be the distal end of the bone corresponding\r\nto that called in birds the tarsus or tarso-metatarsus, is badly\r\npreserved. Yet so close is its resemblance in form, structure, and\r\napposition of the constituent bones to what obtains among birds,\r\nthat it may probably be identified as the tarsus; while the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of Pterodactyle bones which it shows, demonstrate that\r\nit is not from a bird, but from an Ornithosaurian skeleton.\r\n\r\nThe bones are of paper thinness, and consist of a strong bone behind\r\nwhich distally appears on the inner side to be compressed and thrown\r\nbackward and flattened at the side, exactly like the inner toe in\r\nNatatorial birds. On the front of this strong support, confluent with\r\nit, and confluent together, so that the places of union are only seen\r\nat the distal end and in transverse section, are three bones, together\r\nas wide as the bone on which they rest. It does not appear possible\r\nthat the distal articulations could have supported more than three\r\ndigits.\r\n\r\nThis bone, if correctly determined, offers points of affinity\r\nwith birds as pronounced and as important as any thing shown by\r\nthe extremities, for among reptiles a welding of the (tarsal or)\r\ntarso-metatarsal bones is unknown, and here it is as absolute as in any\r\nbird, and takes a characteristic bird shape. In the Rodent Jerboa the\r\nmetatarsus has much the same form as in a bird.\r\n\r\nNo phalanges have been recognised.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vertebral Column.\r\n\r\n  ATLAS AND AXIS.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 9.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_     1      1-15\r\n\r\nFifteen specimens are mounted to exemplify the structures of the\r\nPterodactyle atlas and axis. Nos. 1, 11, and 2 have already been\r\nfigured, and described by Prof Owen, the latter as a section of a\r\ncervical vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe _atlas_ centrum, a saucer-shaped disk of bone, commonly united more\r\nor less intimately with the centrum of the axis, but sometimes free. It\r\npresents in front a hemispherical cup for the basi-occipital, and is\r\nflattened or slightly convex behind. Its neural arch is seen in Nos.\r\n2, 10, and 12; but the only specimen with the arch entire is in the\r\nmuseum of James Carter, Esq. The neurapophyses vary in form and size,\r\nbut always are small obliquely flattened lamellar bones, which extend\r\nupward and backward to meet the neural arch of the axis, just above the\r\nneural canal, where a thin and small cross piece connects them together.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive aspect of these bones is given by the neural arch of\r\nthe _axis_, which is very much elevated, and is formed by two flattened\r\nsides, which meet in a vertical ridge above the neural canal, and look\r\nforward, outward and upward; extending laterally more and more beyond\r\nthe side of the centrum, but not reaching so far back as the posterior\r\narticulation of the centrum. Each side of the neural arch at its middle\r\npart behind is produced into a thick obliquely flattened process,\r\nthe under portion of which shows the small posterior zygapophysial\r\nfacets, which look downward, outward and backward. The lateral outline\r\nof the part of the neural arch above this process is concave; as is\r\nthe lateral outline between it and the centrum. Behind, the neural\r\narch is concave, and looks a little backward. The neural canal is\r\nstirrup-shaped in front, but is higher and sub-ovate behind. The neural\r\narch of this, as of all the other vertebræ, except a few dorsals, is\r\ninseparably united to the centrum, without a trace of the line of\r\nunion. In the middle of the side of the vertebra, and at what may be\r\npresumed to be the union between the neural arch and the centrum, in a\r\nconcavity, is the pneumatic foramen. It is round or oval, and varies\r\nin form and size though not in position. In No. 8 it exhibits the\r\nsubdivided reticular structure characteristic of the pneumatic foramina\r\nof birds. In No. 10, which has a short centrum, the pneumatic cavities\r\nare reduced to a few small perforations, no larger than would be made\r\nwith fine needles.\r\n\r\nThe centrum is shorter than in cervical vertebræ, commonly convex\r\n(No. 8) on the visceral surface; often with a slight longitudinal\r\nhypapophysial ridge (Nos. 1; 7; 12) rarely flattened (No. 10). Towards\r\nthe hinder part the centrum widens, and becomes concave on the visceral\r\nsurface, sending off as do the other cervicals, below the transversely\r\nelongated posterior articulation, a pair of short strong apophyses.\r\n\r\nThe posterior articulation can only by a modification of the idea\r\nbe said to conform to the cup-and-ball plan, for though convex from\r\nabove downward and convex from side to side, the elongated transverse\r\nmeasurement would be three times the depth. On the under side an\r\nimpressed transverse line divides the articulation from the concave\r\npart of the centrum below.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cervical Vertebræ.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 9.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_     2      1-43\r\n\r\nForty-three specimens are mounted to exemplify the variations in size\r\nand characters of cervical vertebræ. These for the most part are\r\nspecific characters; and between the axis and the first dorsal vertebra\r\nthe variations in an individual were slight. [Those nearest to the\r\nback, as in birds, are widest in front, and have the highest neural\r\narches.] The associated series show commonly four cervical vertebræ\r\nbehind the axis, and in two cases apparently five; never more. So that\r\nas seven appears to be the number of true cervical vertebræ in most\r\nif not all of the German Pterodactyles, it may be presumed that the\r\nCretaceous Ornithosaurians also had this character in common, with\r\nMammals, and probably as persistent. In Iguana there are 6, in Monitor\r\n7, and in Crocodile 8.\r\n\r\nThe centrum is united to the neural arch as in birds, without a trace\r\nof suture; sometimes the neural arch is no wider than the centrum,\r\nsometimes it extends over the centrum on each side. Those forms\r\nwith a narrow neural arch have the neural spine high, and its sides\r\nlook forward as well as outward. The pneumatic foramen is oblique.\r\nAn example is figured by Prof. Owen, in the memoir on Pterodactylus\r\nsimus, pl. 2, fig. 4. The forms with a wide neural arch have the neural\r\nspine rising from the middle of the dorsal surface, erect and equally\r\ncompressed from side to side. The pneumatic foramen is horizontal. An\r\nexample is figured in Prof. Owen's memoir on Pt. simus, pl. 2, fig. 1.\r\nThese two forms of cervical vertebræ may be regarded as typifying two\r\ngenera.\r\n\r\nIn both forms many characters occur in common, and as the specimens\r\nillustrative of special modifications will be described hereafter,\r\nthe following description has been made to embrace the chief\r\ncharacteristics of these vertebræ in Cretaceous Ornithosaurians.\r\n\r\nThe inferior aspect of the centrum is oblong (being narrower than\r\nlong), or quadrate; when quadrate the additional lateral expansions are\r\nexternal to the pneumatic foramina, and are formed by the neural arch\r\nand zygapophyses. The centrum proper is a little wider in front than\r\nbehind, and the side outlines are concave. The base of the centrum is\r\nflattened, or more or less hollow, or more or less tumid and regularly\r\nconvex; in front there is often a mesial ridge, which never reaches\r\nthe posterior articulation, and forms a prominent tubercle at the base\r\nof the anterior articulation. At the posterior end the outline of the\r\ncentrum is concave, and mesially the bone has a hollow corresponding\r\nto the tubercle in front of the adjacent vertebra; and the part of\r\nthe centrum on each side is prolonged slightly into a strong rounded\r\nor flattened tubercle below the side borders of the posterior\r\narticulation; these posterior processes, in vertebræ in situ, fitted,\r\non each side of the mesial anterior process of the vertebra behind, on\r\nto concavities more or less marked. Analagous processes are developed\r\nin the cervical vertebræ of many birds.\r\n\r\nAll the Cretaceous Pterodactyles have the articular surfaces of\r\nthe centrum transversely oblong, as have some birds. The posterior\r\narticulation is convex from side to side, and convex from above\r\ndownward, and appears to extend a little further on this neural than\r\non the hæmal surface; in outline it is commonly an elongated oval,\r\nbut sometimes attends on the upper surface of the inferior lateral\r\ntubercles. The anterior articulation is transversely elongated, concave\r\nin both directions, and sub-triangular in outline; that is to say, the\r\nsuperior outline is more or less convex, and from its limits to the\r\nmesial tubercle at the base, the inferior outlines are more or less\r\nconcave.\r\n\r\nThe neural canal is sub-circular or ovate in outline, and quite as\r\nlarge as the neural canal in vertebræ of Dinornis of similar size.\r\n\r\nThe neural arch like the centrum has commonly a depressed appearance.\r\nIt always has a neural spinous process which is directed upward. In\r\nthe depressed type the neural surface of the vertebra is in outline\r\nusually sub-quadrate, but concave at each side, and concave in front\r\nand behind; the four corners are the processes which support the\r\nzygapophysial facets, the surface is divided into two lateral parts by\r\nthe strong neural spine. These lateral parts are from front to back\r\nflat, or slightly concave, or slightly convex; and from the neural\r\nspine outward they are always concave. The neural spine is commonly\r\nsharp in front and flattened behind. The neural arch is placed well\r\nforward, so that while a third of the neural canal remains uncovered by\r\nit behind, rarely a sixth would be uncovered in front.\r\n\r\nThe anterior and posterior zygapophyses are commonly connected by a\r\nmore or less rounded ridge, undefined above, but well defined below,\r\nsince under its posterior part at about the middle of the side of the\r\ncentrum is placed the pneumatic foramen.\r\n\r\nThe anterior zygapophysial processes are separated from the anterior\r\narticular surface of the centrum by a more or less oblique channel.\r\nTowards the base of this channel in many vertebræ may be seen a small\r\nand short flattened antero-posterior perforation corresponding in\r\nposition with the usually large perforation for the vertebral artery.\r\nIf the passages are to be regarded as having subserved such a function,\r\nit will not be without interest to remark the small relative size of\r\nthe cerebellum in these animals; since the vertebral artery conveys the\r\nblood to that region of the brain.\r\n\r\nThe anterior zygapophyses are strong processes directed forward and\r\noutward, compressed a little from side to side; they are placed at the\r\nouter sides of the anterior articular face of the centrum, and extend\r\nin front of it.\r\n\r\nThe zygapophysial facet is commonly oval and looks upward and inward\r\nand forward.\r\n\r\nThe posterior zygapophyses are short and massive, but otherwise\r\ncorrespond closely with the anterior zygapophyses, only with all the\r\nparts reversed, and except that necessarily they are relatively to the\r\nneural canal a little higher.\r\n\r\nA sharp and well defined angular ridge, commencing at the back of the\r\nzygapophysis, is directed inward, and forward, and upward along the\r\nposterior margin of the neural arch to the top of the neural spine. The\r\nposterior aspect of the neural arch is concave from side to side, and\r\nmakes a right angle with the superior lateral aspect.\r\n\r\nThe part of the centrum exposed behind the neural arch is convex above\r\nfrom side to side.\r\n\r\nThe pneumatic foramen between the centrum and the neural arch varies\r\ngreatly in size; it is oval and longitudinal.\r\n\r\nThe largest specimens have the centrum 2-1/2 inches long; in the\r\nsmallest the centrum measures 5/8ths of an inch in length.\r\n\r\nIn the second type of cervical vertebra the side of the centrum makes\r\na right angle with the base, and is separated from it by a sharp angle\r\nas in struthious birds. The side of the centrum is concave, with a\r\nfew small pneumatic perforations; and the side of the centrum, which\r\nis high posteriorly, rounds over the oblique ridge connecting the\r\nzygapophyses, into the oblique lateral face of the neural arch. The\r\nanterior zygapophyses are very large and the posterior zygapophyses\r\nsmall and placed as high as the top of the neural canal.\r\n\r\nEvery region of the vertebral column displays pneumatic foramina,\r\nsituated as in the vertebræ of birds.\r\n\r\nThe large proportional size of the neck-vertebræ is common to some\r\nbirds, and is conspicuous in many mammals, like the Llama. In most\r\nmammals where the vertebræ have a cup-and-ball articulation, the ball\r\nis in front, as it is in the dorsal vertebræ of the penguin, so that\r\nthose vertebræ are not comparable with Pterodactyles, although on the\r\nunder side of the centrum they similarly give off a mesial process\r\nbelow the cup, and a lateral process below the ball on each side. The\r\nneural spine in Pterodactyle is commonly more developed than is the\r\ncase with long-necked birds or mammals. Reptiles such as Crocodiles and\r\nLizards have the neural spines of the neck-vertebræ well developed.\r\nBirds differ from Pterodactyles in the peculiar articulation of their\r\nvertebræ. In both the centrum is often depressed, in both it is concave\r\nfrom side to side in front, and convex from side to side behind, but\r\nin birds it is also convex from above downward in front, and concave\r\nfrom above downward behind, while the reverse arrangement obtains in\r\nPterodactyles. A similar condition to that of the bird is seen in\r\nthe neck-vertebræ of the Kangaroo, of Man, and several mammals, only\r\nthe vertical curves are less marked. Vertebræ concave in front, and\r\nconvex behind, and devoid of cervical ribs, are met with among the\r\nLizards, but neither Monitor nor Iguana offer any parallel to the form\r\nof the cervical vertebræ of Pterodactyle, which is best matched among\r\nMarsupials and Birds. Birds commonly have more vertebræ in the neck\r\nthan have Pterodactyles, which in that respect resemble mammals and\r\nsome Lizards.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dorsal Vertebræ.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 10.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_     3      1-20\r\n\r\nTwenty specimens are mounted to exemplify pectoral and dorsal vertebræ.\r\nLike the cervical vertebræ, they include two types of form, one with\r\nthe centrum flat, figured in pl. 2. fig. 20-22 of the memoir on\r\nPterodactylus Sedgwicki, and regarded by Prof Owen as anterior dorsal;\r\nand the other form with a convex centrum, figured 24-25 of the same\r\nplate of the same memoir, regarded by Prof. Owen as posterior dorsal.\r\nFollowing the analogy of birds such determination is as well supported\r\nas the similar reference of the two types of cervical vertebræ to\r\nanterior and posterior parts of the neck, but fuller materials compel a\r\nreference of the two types of dorsal vertebræ to two different genera.\r\n\r\n  Nos. 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 19 belong to the flat type. Nos.\r\n  2, 4, 5, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18 exemplify the convex type.\r\n\r\nDorsal vertebræ are rare fossils; and in the associated sets of bones\r\nnever more than four dorsal vertebræ are found, rarely more than one.\r\nNo specimen of the type with a convex centrum occurs in the associated\r\nsets.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal vertebræ with convex centra have all lost their neural\r\narches except No. 2. The form of the centrum is half a cylinder, as\r\nlong, or longer than wide, but sometimes depressed, and wider behind\r\nthan in front. The exterior surface is smooth, convex from side to\r\nside, and slightly concave from front to back. The neural surface is\r\nmesially excavated. Both anterior and posterior articular surfaces are\r\nsemicircular or sub-ovate, being wide from side to side.\r\n\r\nThe anterior articulation is cupped, concave from the neural to\r\nthe hæmal surface, and concave from side to side. The posterior\r\narticulation is convex from the neural to the hæmal surface, in which\r\ndirection, it usually shows striations, and from side to side has a\r\ngentle convexity, sometimes so slight as to be nearly flat.\r\n\r\nThe neural canal is large, ovate, and as high as is the centrum.\r\n\r\nThe neural arch is strong, compressed from back to front, and placed\r\nas usual on the anterior part of the centrum. In outline it is\r\nsub-rhomboid with the sides concave. There is a strong process on\r\neach side above the neural canal for a rib, and apparently a neural\r\nspine, but all are broken. The transverse processes for the ribs are\r\ndirected outward, and a little forward, flattened in front and behind,\r\nthe surfaces being sub-parallel, so that in front the neural arch\r\nis concave from side to side. Behind, the neural spine is directed\r\nbetween the transverse processes so as to over-hang the exposed part\r\nof the superior surface of the centrum. At the points where the neural\r\nspine bends back from the transverse processes are the posterior\r\nzygapophyses, high above the neural canal, and parted from each other\r\nby an interspace as wide as the canal is high. They look downward,\r\noutward, and backward. The lateral surface below the transverse process\r\nis narrow, flattened, bends at a right angle with the posterior\r\nsurface, rounds into the anterior surface, is a continuous curve with\r\nthe side of the centrum, and is concave from below upward. The superior\r\nsurfaces of the neural arch have the sides sub-parallel, they are\r\neach concave from side to side; and these surfaces are excavated for\r\npneumatic foramina.\r\n\r\nDorsal vertebræ of the type with the centrum flattened closely resemble\r\ncervical vertebræ with the centrum flattened, differing chiefly in the\r\nless length of the centrum. Occasionally (as in No. 3) the neural arch\r\ncomes away from the body of the vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe centrum is very depressed, sub-quadrate, and wider than long;\r\nthe base is flat, or slightly concave, with occasionally a slight\r\nlongitudinal mesial ridge; the lateral outlines are concave, so that\r\nthe bone is pinched in from side to side. The neural surface of the\r\ncentrum is flat and parallel with the base, and, as usual, wider behind\r\nthan in front, but the centrum is not there so high. The surfaces for\r\nthe neural arch are flat, and extend nearly to the base of the centrum\r\nin front, so that they look upward, outward and a little forward.\r\n\r\nThe articular ends are remarkable for their depressed oblong character,\r\nstill preserving the anterior concavity with a small mesial process\r\nbelow, as in cervical vertebræ, and similar but smaller processes\r\nat the inferior outer angles of the posterior sub-semicylindrical\r\nconvexity. The middle third of the anterior cup is made by the\r\ntrapezoidal anterior end of the centrum; sometimes the sutures between\r\nit and the neural arch are well marked.\r\n\r\nThe neural arch is large, commonly with a sub-circular neural canal.\r\nThe neural spine is high, compressed so as to have the lateral surfaces\r\nsub-parallel and rounding into each other superiorly; and it has a\r\nless antero-posterior extent than the centrum. At its base behind\r\nit widens rapidly, and forms massive quadrate processes, extending\r\noutward and backward, which on the outside each have a flattened ovate\r\nzygapophysial facet, which also looks downward. Above the facet and\r\nseparated from it by a groove is a tubercle. Between the zygapophyses\r\nbehind the bone is concave from side to side; the facets are placed\r\nabove the neural canal.\r\n\r\nThe posterior zygapophyses are placed considerably higher than the\r\nanterior zygapophyses, and the part of the neural arch between is\r\nrather constricted from front to back. The neural arch steadily widens\r\nin front down to the base of the anterior zygapophysial processes in\r\nsuch way that the more or less flattened lateral surface looks outward\r\nand is gently concave from above downward. A ridge commencing at the\r\ntubercle over the posterior zygapophysial facet descends in a curve\r\nforward and downward, to form the posterior border of the anterior\r\nzygapophysial process. This is separated by a groove from the anterior\r\narticular surface, and anterior part of the base of the centrum, and\r\nhas the aspect of a compressed part of the neural arch, extending\r\nobliquely downward, and forward, over and beyond the articular surface\r\nof the centrum. The anterior zygapophysial facets are oblong, narrow\r\nfrom side to side, and long from front to back; they are directed\r\nforward and a little outward, and are flattened, make nearly a right\r\nangle behind with the front of the neural arch, and look upward and\r\ninward. They are sometimes placed as high as the top of the neural\r\ncanal, but are commonly lower. Around the neural canal the bone is\r\nconically impressed.\r\n\r\nMinute pneumatic foramina are in the usual position, between the\r\ncentrum and the neural arch; and sometimes others behind the anterior\r\nzygapophysial process.\r\n\r\nThe largest specimen known has the centrum nearly an inch and a half\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal vertebræ in Cambridge specimens would appear to make a\r\nnearer approximation in number to birds than to Mammals or Lizards or\r\nCrocodiles, though Chelonians have few vertebræ in the back. Among\r\nReptiles the form of the vertebra makes some approach to that of the\r\nMonitor, Chameleon and Scink. In most Mammals the dorsal vertebræ have\r\nthe centrum convex, though in the lumbar region its visceral surface\r\noften becomes flattened. But though very unlike there is a nearer\r\nresemblance to the lower dorsal vertebræ of a Struthious bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sacrum.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 10.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_     4      1-7\r\n\r\nSeven specimens are mounted to exemplify the ordinary structures of the\r\nOrnithosaurian sacrum.\r\n\r\nNos. 1 and 2 have the centrum convex, exactly as in the dorsal vertebræ\r\nof the convex type. Nos. 3-7 have the centrum flattened, following in\r\ngeneral features the plan of the dorsal vertebræ with flat centra.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 is a vertebra from a sacrum, where perfect anchylosis had not\r\nbeen induced; it has the neural arch well preserved, and shows the\r\nsharp suture which united it to the preceding vertebra.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 shows two entire vertebræ and part of a third, which have lost\r\nthe neural arches but have the centra perfectly anchylosed together.\r\nThe middle vertebra measures 5/8 of an inch in length, and at the\r\nsuture from side to side measures more. The surface is smooth,\r\nregularly convex from side to side, and gently concave from back\r\nto front. The last vertebra shows the articular vertebral surface;\r\nit is convex in both directions, and oblique, so that a large part\r\nlooks upward. The anterior of the three vertebræ is pinched in at the\r\nlower part of the sides of the centrum. No. 1 shows that the neural\r\nsurface of the centrum is deeply excavated, making the neural canal\r\nan elongated upright oval. Above the centrum, which forms only the\r\nmiddle third of the articular surface, the neural arch expands on each\r\nside into a wedge-shaped transverse process, the lower surfaces are\r\nflattened, and continuous with the centrum, while the upper surfaces\r\nare flat and horizontal as in birds and Dinosaurs, and form the\r\nplatform from which arises the massive neural spine.\r\n\r\nIn front the transverse wedge is flattened and compressed, so as\r\nto look forward and outward, and in the middle shows a large ovate\r\npneumatic foramen. Behind, the wedge is compressed so as to look\r\nbackward and downward.\r\n\r\nThe neural spine is massive and forms rather more than half the height\r\nof the vertebra. It is flattened with a ridge rising near its base in\r\nfront and ascending in a concave curve obliquely backward and upward.\r\nThe anterior parts approximate a little in front, while the small parts\r\nposterior to the ridge approximate a little behind. The sides of the\r\nneural spine approximate superiorly, and appear to round into each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThere is a notch on each side in front at the base of the neural spine,\r\nand another above the central articulation. The neural spines appear to\r\nhave been united by suture. It may be instructive to compare the neural\r\nspine just described with the specimens =J=. _c_. 10.\r\n\r\nOf the second type or genus No. 4 to 7 all show the anterior cup for\r\nthe last lumbar vertebra. No. 3, 5 and 6 all show two entire vertebræ\r\nand part of a third preserved, but no specimen shows the posterior\r\ntermination of the sacrum. No. 7 has the articular face of the centrum\r\nvery broad, and greatly depressed. In No. 6 it is ovate and has the\r\nneural arch preserved; above a semicircular neural canal it sends\r\nout on each side a short horn-like zygapophysial process. No. 4 is\r\nremarkable for the small size of the circular neural canal, the centrum\r\nwhen entire measuring an inch from side to side, while the neural canal\r\nonly measures 5/16 of an inch. No. 5 is figured by Prof. Owen. No. 4-6\r\nappear to have given off transverse processes from the sides of the\r\ncentra. No. 7 appears to widen into transverse processes at the point\r\nof suture between the centra.\r\n\r\nIn No. 3 the base of the sacrum is flattened, and its sides pinched in,\r\nand concave in outline from back to front. In this hollow are small\r\npneumatic foramina, and between the hollows the vertebræ widen in the\r\nline of the suture so as to send out strong short transverse processes\r\nor tubercles. Above the hollows are given out the strong horizontal\r\nquadrate pyramidal transverse processes. All their sides are flattened\r\nor a little concave, and the under side displays a large ovate\r\npneumatic foramen. Each of the four angles of the transverse process\r\ngives off a ridge. The lower ones descend obliquely to the anterior\r\nand posterior intersutural tubercles. The upper two ascend obliquely,\r\nin front and behind, and form rounded ridges on the neural spine. The\r\nneural spine is flattened, moderately compressed from side to side, and\r\ncupped a little over each transverse process. In front the neural spine\r\nis flattened transversely and perpendicular; the transverse processes\r\nare also flattened and a little in advance of the neural spine.\r\n\r\nThe sacrum in its general aspect is Mammalian. In the Bird the\r\nvertebræ are much more numerous and do not retain their individuality\r\nso well. In Reptiles properly so called, the sacrum never includes more\r\nthan two or three vertebræ, and those commonly remain unanchylosed. But\r\nin almost any placental Mammal in which several vertebræ are anchylosed\r\ntogether, a sacrum similar to that of the Pterodactyle is met with. No\r\nmammalian sacrum, however, is furnished with pneumatic foramina.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Caudal Vertebræ.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 10.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_     5      1-13\r\n\r\nThirteen specimens are mounted to exemplify the osteology of caudal\r\nvertebræ. No. 7 has been figured by Prof. Owen in the memoir on\r\nPterodactylus simus, pl. 2 fig. 13-16. The centrum of the largest\r\nspecimens measures one inch and a quarter long, and the vertebra\r\nis half an inch wide from side to side in the middle. The smallest\r\nspecimen No. 13 has the centrum 3/4 of an inch long. The vertebræ vary\r\nin proportions, some being much more slender than others. They present\r\na close approximation in form to the first type of cervical vertebræ,\r\ndiffering chiefly in being more elongated.\r\n\r\nThey are elongated bones constricted in the middle, so that the\r\noutlines of the sides seen from above or below are gently concave;\r\nthe outline of the anterior end is sub-rhomboid, the outline of the\r\nposterior end is sub-pentagonal, as would be a transverse section of\r\nthe vertebra. The long outlines of the base of the centrum and of the\r\ntop of the neural arch are sub-parallel.\r\n\r\nThe two sides of the upper surface of the neural arch are smooth,\r\nflattened, a little concave from back to front; they are inclined to\r\neach other pent-house wise at about a right angle, and are separated\r\nthroughout their length by a narrow slightly elevated neural spine.\r\nBehind, the neural arch is truncated transversely so as to expose\r\nthe posterior neural surface of the centrum, which is convex from\r\nside to side. The outermost lateral angles of the neural arch are the\r\nposterior zygapophysial processes, short and strong above the centrum,\r\nwith a tubercle on the upper surface, and showing the sub-circular\r\nzygapophysial facets behind; they look backward and downward, and\r\nare separated by a groove from the region of the centrum. Under the\r\nsharp ridge which connects these zygapophyses behind, the neural arch\r\nis excavated, and the cup shows the termination of three canals. The\r\nlargest one is the upright oval of the neural canal in the middle,\r\non each of its sides separated by a narrow bony wall is another\r\nperforation, very variable in size and shape, sometimes b& large as the\r\nneural canal, but usually small and circular. The anterior end of the\r\nneural arch is cut into, so that as seen from above, the straight sharp\r\nanterior margins diverge mesially from each other at a right angle, and\r\nso expose to view a small anterior part of the neural surface of the\r\ncentrum. These lines are prolonged forward and outward, to form the\r\nupper margin of the anterior zygapophyses, which are compressed and\r\nprolonged over and beyond the sides of the anterior articulation, from\r\nwhich they are separated by a slight groove; the anterior and posterior\r\nzygapophyses are connected by a rounded ridge. The anterior end of the\r\nneural arch is excavated, but less so than the posterior end; in the\r\nmiddle is the oval perforation of the neural canal, and at the sides\r\nother perforations corresponding to those behind are placed a little\r\nin advance of the neural canal. The anterior and posterior articular\r\nsurfaces differ in no respect from those of cervical vertebræ.\r\n\r\nThe inferior surface of the centrum is separated from the sides by two\r\nridges parallel to the lateral concave outlines of the neural arch;\r\nthey extend from sides of the front, more or less well marked, to the\r\ntubercular processes at the base of the sides of the centrum behind.\r\nThe dice-box shaped area of the centrum so inscribed is usually concave\r\nfrom front to back, and concave from side to side behind, and convex\r\nfrom side to side in the middle; this convexity is only broken in front\r\nby the development of the slight mesial hypapophysial ridge.\r\n\r\nThe sides are narrow, flattened, look downward and outward, are a\r\nlittle concave from front to back, round into the centrum and into the\r\nneural arch, and show at about the middle a small pneumatic foramen,\r\nwhich is variable in size, but largest in No. 8, and sometimes a mere\r\npuncture.\r\n\r\nThe caudal vertebræ differ in many ways from other animals. They\r\nhave neither transverse processes, neural spines, hypapophyses or\r\nhæmapophyses. In the persistence of the neural arch down the tail they\r\nresemble reptiles and birds rather than mammals, in which nothing but\r\nthe centrum persists to the end of the tail. The vertebræ are furnished\r\nwith vertebral arteries which run through the neural arch parallel to\r\nthe neural canal, in exactly the same position as do the vertebral\r\narteries in the neck-vertebræ of the Llama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BONES OF THE HEAD.\r\n\r\nPl. 11, 12.\r\n\r\nThe skull of Dimorphodon differs in form and in many important details\r\nof structure from that of Rhamphorhynchus; and both of these types of\r\nskull are strikingly unlike that of the short-tailed animals named\r\nPterodactyle. Hence, as it will be shown that the Cretaceous fossils\r\nof this class belong to very distinct new genera, there is no reason\r\nfor assigning to them by anticipation any class of cranial structures.\r\nThe cranium of this type of animal has never been critically described,\r\nand for all that is yet known to the contrary Pterodactyles may differ\r\nbetween themselves as much as birds or mammals. Their affinities have\r\nbeen unknown. Therefore, before describing bones it may be desirable\r\nto state the grounds on which the several specimens are referred to\r\nthe Ornithosauria. The fossils on which this section of the memoir is\r\nfounded are, the basi-occipital and basi-temporal bones, the anterior\r\nportion of a cranium, the back parts of four crania, facial bones, and\r\nthe quadrate and quadrato-jugal.\r\n\r\nThe crania are all no larger than that of the Heron; though from\r\nthe Greensand are bones and jaws indicating Pterodactyles both\r\nsmaller and larger. The skulls are mostly remarkable for wanting\r\nboth basi-occipital and basi-temporal bones. And the specimen of\r\nbasi-temporal and basi-occipital corresponds posteriorly with the\r\nPterodactyle atlas, anteriorly with these crania; it is hence concluded\r\nto have belonged to a similar animal. Being relatively twice as\r\nlarge, it indicates that in these animals the basi-occipital condyle\r\nwas proportionally larger than in known birds; and that animals of\r\na cognate kind had skulls probably twice the size of these. The\r\nanterior basal part of the hinder sphenoid terminates in a remarkable\r\ntriangular surface, with two perforations, which are separated by a\r\nmedian ridge. Almost entirely corresponding with this is the basal\r\nsurface of the anterior part of a cranium, fractured in front of the\r\npituitary fossa. Therefore, and as it indicates a similar capacity of\r\nbrain, it is regarded as belonging to the same kind of animal as the\r\nothers ; but being five times the size, it must, if the proportions of\r\nthe Heron were preserved, have been part of a head a yard long.\r\n\r\nNow, as there is no other animal with the same texture of bone, or\r\nexhibiting with high organization the same diversity of size, these\r\ncranial fragments are referred to the jaws and bones of Pterodactyle.\r\nSo marked are their structures that many quarry-men refer vertebrate\r\nfossils to their several orders with almost as much accuracy as would a\r\npractised anatomist.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Basi-occipital and Basi-temporal.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 11.\r\n\r\n  Basi-occipital, Owen, _Sup. Cret. Rep._ p. 6, T. 1, figs. 11, 12, 13.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet.\r\n   =J=   _c_     7\r\n\r\nThis bone was not found associated with any set of fossils that\r\nwould induce us to refer it to one species more than to another. Its\r\nOrnithosaurian character was probable; and Prof. Owen described it in\r\nhis last memoir on the Greensand Pterodactyles.\r\n\r\nBut though indubitably basi-occipital, it is so anomalous in some\r\nrespects that the Professor regarded the under as the upper surface;\r\nsince then the investing phosphate of lime has been removed, and the\r\nbone is now described in what appears to be its natural position.\r\n\r\nViewed from above the fossil divides into two parts; the occipital\r\ncondyle, and an anterior, wide, transversely oblong extension\r\nterminating at each side in a strong short horn. The posterior half\r\nof the condyle shows large cancelli as though so much of it had been\r\ncovered by the articular cartilage. The sides of the condyle converge,\r\nso that posteriorly it is only two-thirds of the width it has at the\r\nforamen magnum, which would appear to indicate a comparatively slight\r\nlateral motion of the head. The condyle is hemispherical posteriorly\r\nand superiorly; there is a depression between it and the great foramen\r\nof the skull; inferiorly it is flat.\r\n\r\nIt is 7/16 of an inch long; posteriorly 9/16 wide, nearly 6/16 of an\r\ninch high anteriorly. It terminates in front superiorly in an elevated\r\ntransverse ridge.\r\n\r\nOn removing the matrix, the anterior surface of this occipital bone\r\nwas found to be concave; yet as nothing but cancellous structure is\r\nseen it may be but imperfectly ossified or more probably, imperfectly\r\npreserved. And the bottom of this cup expands forward in a thin sheet\r\nof bone a quarter of an inch long and half an inch wide, which on the\r\nunder side is continuous with the base of the condyle.\r\n\r\nOn each side of this floor and partly extending in front of it, and\r\nbelow it, is an irregular piece of bone, half an inch long, resembling\r\nanterior zygapophyses of cervical vertebræ.\r\n\r\nThough in most vertebrates the basi-occipital enters into the basal\r\nfloor of the skull, the median bones are either so placed that they\r\nrest one upon another from before backwards or abut against one another\r\nnearly perpendicular, so that the basi-sphenoid comes commonly to\r\nunderlap and partly hide the basi-occipital. Nowhere among Amphibia or\r\nReptilia do I know of the reverse position occurring. In some fishes\r\nthere is an approach to it. Thus a slight anterior bony expansion of\r\nthe basi-occipital in the Cod fits partly into a horizontal slit in\r\nthe basi-sphenoid[A]. In the Carp the basi-occipital has a spathulate\r\nbasal expansion like that of Pterodactyle, but it is underlapped by the\r\nbasi-sphenoid[S]. In some mammals the under side of the basi-occipital\r\nextends further forward than does the neural side, as for example\r\nin the Sheep and Goat; while in a few others, as in the Walrus, the\r\nreverse positions obtain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote S: Parasphenoid of Prof. Huxley.]\r\n\r\nBut it is among Birds that the structure described in Pterodactyle\r\nis evident and characteristic. For although the bony plate under the\r\nsphenoid,--Mr Parker's basi-temporals,--is mostly anchylosed to the\r\nbones about it, and less with the occipital than with others, its\r\nposition and relations are quite the same as those of the expanded flap\r\nof this Pterodactyle basi-occipital. Therefore it is identified with\r\nthe basi-temporal bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Back of the Cranium.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 11.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_     8       1\r\n\r\nThis fossil is an inch high, rather wider, and half an inch long. It\r\nwell shows the bones at the back of the skull, the basi-cranial bones,\r\nand the bones posterior to the frontals, which roof in the Cranium.\r\nThere are in it striking resemblances to the back of the skull of some\r\nNatatores, as the Grannet and Cormorant, and of some Grallatores as the\r\nHeron, and Gallinaceous birds as the Cock.\r\n\r\n_The base of the skull._ The bones here indicated are the\r\nbasi-occipital, basi-temporal, and basi-sphenoid. The former two\r\nhave come away as from an articular joint, and are wanting. The\r\nbasi-occipital does not enter into the floor of the cranial cavity, and\r\nonly rims the foramen magnum. But its basi-temporal expansion rests\r\nbeneath the posterior part of the basi-sphenoid forming the base of the\r\nskull; its long convex anterior end fits into the concave groove at the\r\nback of the anterior part of the sphenoid. The squamous basi-temporal\r\nbone appears in this species to have been as long as the foramen magnum\r\nis wide, and to have been relatively thicker than in the other form\r\nalready described.\r\n\r\nThe _basi-sphenoid_ is a thin expanded bone forming the floor for the\r\ncerebellum, and terminating anteriorly in a triangular mass, while the\r\nslightly convex part behind, covered with the basi-temporals, is nearly\r\nsquare. It enters into the foramen magnum, forming its lower part;\r\nand is confluent with the ex-occipitals behind, with the periotic,\r\nalisphenoid and perhaps with the squamosal at the side; and as in birds\r\nall these sutures are obliterated. This is probably the only instance\r\nin the Animal Kingdom in which the basi-sphenoid takes so important\r\nand singular a share in the functions of the basi-occipital bone. The\r\nanterior part of the basi-sphenoid projects below the posterior part,\r\nis nearly flat on the basal surface, and forms an equilateral triangle\r\nwith the apex in front and base behind. In the middle of the triangular\r\nbone is a slight longitudinal ridge, and behind the middle of each\r\nouter side a rather large foramen which appears to be the inferior\r\nopening for the carotid artery. The triangular part is hollow and as\r\nlong as the quadrate portion. The lateral parts of this anterior bone\r\nare nearly flat. They converge upwards and are rounded in front to\r\nform the boundary of the pituitary fossa, and do not appear to have\r\nterminated in a spine. Above are the alisphenoids.\r\n\r\n_The upper part of the skull_ is divided into two segments by a strong\r\nstraight transverse ridge, which leaves the occipital bones behind, and\r\nthe parietal &c. in front.\r\n\r\nThe occipital bones anchylosed together are about two-thirds the width\r\nof the foramen magnum, and of the parietal bones, with which latter the\r\nsupra-occipital makes an angle of 45°. The surface is irregular, and\r\nespecially is marked by a deep concavity just above each ex-occipital.\r\nThe supra-occipital projects slightly over the plane of the foramen\r\nmagnum, to which the strong ridge bounding the segment in front is\r\nparallel. The great foramen is nearly round, being slightly compressed\r\nat the upper part of the sides: it measures 3/8 of an inch high and is\r\nnearly as wide.\r\n\r\nThe _occipital bones_ make with those at the base of the skull an\r\nangle of about 145° or 150°. In outline they are a transverse diamond\r\nshape. The mastoid portion is not to be distinguished from the other\r\nbones, but appear to terminate the sides of the strong occipital\r\ncrest, which by posterior compression of the squamosals and parietals,\r\nbecomes very strong, and makes the backward boundary of the temporal\r\nfoss. This crest is in the same plane with the anterior border of the\r\nbasi-temporals.\r\n\r\nThe _parietals_ meet above in a slight ridge. They are two rectangular\r\nbones twice as wide as long, forming a semicircular roof for the brain,\r\nwhich looks outward and a little backward. Anteriorly these bones\r\nunite with the frontals in a slightly flexuous transverse line; and\r\ninferiorly they are connected with the periotic, the squamosal, and\r\nperhaps with the anterior point of the alisphenoid: they do not descend\r\nto the plane of the articulations of the free quadrate bones. The\r\nsurface is smooth, and on the upper part flat, but concave below from\r\nside to side.\r\n\r\nBelow these parietals are the _squamosals_ and _alisphenoids_, but the\r\nsuture between them is not seen. They are in form a trapezium where\r\nthe short side is anterior, and the lower third is folded inward so as\r\nto be confluent with the anterior part of the sphenoid. The fold forms\r\na ridge, which I suppose may run obliquely over the alisphenoid. The\r\nunfolded squamosal part is a flat and smooth oblong, with parallel\r\nsides, the bones are in parallel planes and nearly perpendicular to the\r\nbase of the skull. Where the alisphenoid joins the sphenoid, there is\r\na considerable concavity, above which is a small circular impression.\r\nThese strips approximate inferiorly, so that the width of the skull\r\nthere is rather more than half what it is at their outer margins. They\r\nshut off the pituitary body in front of them, and appear to form part\r\nof the wall for the orbit of the eye.--The slightly convex, lateral,\r\nsquamosal parts above the fold continue the circular transverse outline\r\nof which the parietals are the upper half. They extend anterior to the\r\nparietals, and on the inside give attachment to the frontals. Like the\r\nparietals, they make a sharp bend outward at their hinder border, and\r\nform the lateral terminations of the occipital ridge, which is the\r\nwidest part of this fossil.\r\n\r\nThe only portion of the specimen now to be described is the large\r\nregion at each side looking downward, which extends from the occipital\r\nridge to the sphenoid. It is an irregular pentangular hollow with many\r\ncavities, the hinder of which are for the ear. Two cavities above\r\nthese, under the widest part of the skull, appear to be a double\r\narticulation for the quadrate bone. The outer transverse one with\r\nthe squamosal is separated by a deep groove from the inner and more\r\nvertical one, which may therefore be regarded as with the petrosal\r\nbone. These excavations form the posterior half of the pentagon. The\r\nanterior half is a smooth rhombus not separable from the basi-sphenoid.\r\n\r\nSuch is the external appearance of the occipital and parietal segments\r\nof the skull of a Cambridge Pterodactyle. Each segment forms a large\r\nring of thin bone, inclosing part of a brain-cavity as large as that\r\nof a bird and shaped like that of a bird; and which moreover is made\r\nup of the same bones as the cranium of a bird; and these are in almost\r\nexactly the same proportions as those of the Common Cock.\r\n\r\nMy own investigations do not substantiate Wagner's discovery, that the\r\nback part of the skull resembles that of the Monitor. Iguana would\r\nhave offered a slightly nearer comparison, but they both differ from\r\nCambridge specimens of Pterodactyles in characters like these.\r\n\r\nIn the lizard,\r\n\r\n  The cranial bones do not enclose the brain.\r\n\r\n  There is no division of the back of the skull into an occipital\r\n  segment and a parietal segment by a girdling crest.\r\n\r\n  The squamosal bone does not enter into the cranial wall.\r\n\r\n  The quadrate bone does not articulate with the wall of the brain-case.\r\n\r\nWhile the peculiar backward development of wings of the parietal in a\r\ndiverging V form, give the Lizard skull an aspect of its own.\r\n\r\nSo that it must be asserted that the differences of these Pterodactyles\r\nfrom Lizards are so wide as to preclude comparison.\r\n\r\nWith the Crocodile, in which the cranial bones are massive, and the\r\nquadrate bone firmly packed in the skull, comparison would be no less\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nThe Delphinidæ, in both the form of the jaws and of the back of the\r\nhead, give some support to Wagler's fancy, in putting the Pterodactyle\r\ninto his curious creation, the Gryphi[T]. But in the porpoises the\r\nparietal bones form as narrow a band as they do in the Duck; and are\r\nquite unlike the bones here described. In the Dolphin the two condyles\r\nalmost unite into one semicircular condyle (in young specimens), owing\r\nto the enormous development of the ex-occipitals, which almost if\r\nnot entirely exclude the basi-occipital from the foramen magnum. The\r\ndolphin moreover has no quadrate bone. But notwithstanding the absence\r\nof a division into occipital and parietal segments, the form and\r\narrangement of the bones in the skull of the porpoises approximate more\r\nto the Cambridge Pterodactyles than is the case with Lizards.\r\n\r\n[Footnote T: The Gryphi are a class of animals intermediate between\r\nBirds and Mammals according to Wagler, and including Pterodactyles,\r\nIchthyosaurus, Plesiosaurs, Ornithorhynchus, and Myrmecophaga.]\r\n\r\nBut with Birds the correspondence is so close that it would be\r\ndifficult to discover differences. That one of the condition of the\r\noccipital bone seems to be the most important; another is, that from\r\nthe relatively smaller size of the cerebellum the parietal bones appear\r\nto cover a larger part of the cerebrum; and a third is the strong\r\ntriangular condition of the sphenoid in front of the sella tursica.\r\nWith these exceptions there is nothing to distinguish the fossil\r\ndescribed from the cranium of a bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Back of another Cranium.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 11. fig. 1, 2.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_     8       2\r\n\r\nAnother cranium has occurred which must be referred to a different\r\ngenus. Its preservation is less perfect, but it similarly exhibits the\r\noccipital and parietal segments of the skull. All the bones are blended\r\ntogether without a trace of a suture.\r\n\r\nThe _occipital region_ is flat. Its outline is not defined owing to\r\nthe extent to which the sharp crest, in which it terminated outwardly,\r\nhas been broken away. The occipital condyle is broken off. The foramen\r\nmagnum is of an ovate form--flattened at the base. The ex-occipitals at\r\nits sides are impressed as though from contact with the neurapophyses\r\nof the atlas. Mesially, over the foramen magnum is a vertical elevated\r\ncrest (now rubbed away), which may have given attachment to a bone\r\nlike that post-superoccipital crest described by Quenstedt in the\r\n_Pterodactylus suevicus_. The occipital region makes a great angle with\r\nthe flat basi-temporal region, as in birds.\r\n\r\nThe _parietal region_ is convex from below upward, the lateral parts\r\nconverging towards the crown, which however presents a broken and\r\nworn surface. From side to side the squamosal and parietal bones are\r\nconcave, owing to the extended occipital crest behind, and the rapid\r\nwidening of the skull in front caused by the large size of the brain.\r\n\r\nIn _front_ is seen a section of the brain-cavity. It is very like in\r\nform to the two halves of a pear put together side by side with the\r\nstalk downward. I have removed some of the phosphate of lime from the\r\nbrain-cavity, and although it has not been excavated to the cerebellum,\r\nthe great depth of the brain is well seen, and the convex character of\r\nthe cerebral lobes, between which a crest of bone descends mesially as\r\nin the ethmo-sphenoid mass next described. At each of the lower outer\r\nangles of the brain, extending into the cancellous brain-walls to the\r\noutermost film, is an ovoid convexity, covered with a thin film of\r\nbone. They entirely correspond with the optic lobes, being in exactly\r\nthe same position as in birds, only relatively rather small. Underneath\r\nthe optic lobe on the outside is a small concavity, apparently the\r\narticulation for the quadrate bone. The basi-sphenoid mass below the\r\nbrain is of considerable height, the upper half flat and smooth, the\r\nlower half fractured and cancellous.\r\n\r\nIn the main this skull is like the other one, differing chiefly in the\r\ndepth of the sphenoid, in the mesial ridge between the cerebral lobes,\r\nin showing the optic lobes, and in having anchylosed basi-temporal\r\nbones. There would hence appear to have been considerable variations in\r\nthe skulls of Pterodactyles even in the Cambridge Greensand.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Orbito-ethmo-sphenoid bone.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 11.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet.\r\n   =J=   _c_     9\r\n\r\nThe symmetrical bone which I have so named is a wedge-like mass\r\ntapering in front, keeled above; flattened below, and cupped behind\r\non each side. It belonged to a very much larger animal than the last\r\nfossil, and probably to a very different genus.\r\n\r\nThe _inferior surface_ is triangular, an inch and an eighth wide\r\nbehind, at the base, and an inch and a quarter long; but it is broken\r\nat both ends. In its longitudinal median line is a strong keel stopping\r\nshort in front, dying away behind, and forming with the compressed\r\nmargins a considerable hollow on each side, at the back part of which\r\nis a large oval foramen. This surface, though five times the size,\r\ncorresponds in form, ridges, and foramina with the anterior part of the\r\nsphenoid described in the article on the back of the cranium.\r\n\r\nThe _posterior surface_ is at right angles to the inferior one, but its\r\nlower third shows only fractured phosphate of lime filling perhaps the\r\nanterior part of the pituitary fossa. Its upper part also is broken.\r\nBut on each side is a large concavity measuring in the fractured fossil\r\nan inch and a quarter high, three quarters of an inch wide, and half\r\nan inch deep from the unbroken median ridge where the cups become\r\nconfluent at their base. The whole specimen is two and a quarter inches\r\nhigh. From the determination of the under side it follows that these\r\nsmooth hollows, over each of which an impressed mesial line descends\r\nobliquely outward, are a part of the anterior boundary of the brain.\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of the outer convex border of the oval remains of\r\nthese cups for the cerebral hemispheres, a strong blunt ridge descends\r\nobliquely down the sides of the bone to terminate the compressed\r\nanterior end of the bone just in front of the hypapophysial ridge of\r\nthe sphenoid. Above this ridge the bone is much compressed anteriorly,\r\nforming a strong straight mesial keel above, which rapidly approximates\r\nto the base; the height of the bone in front being one inch and a half,\r\nwhich is also its extreme length.\r\n\r\nThe region below the oblique ridge is a concavity, but it is a little\r\ncompressed from side to side behind, and has the same anterior\r\ncompression, so that the elongated oval of the fracture at the anterior\r\nend of the bone is only three-eighths of an inch wide.\r\n\r\nThe superior ridge will probably have supported the frontals, and the\r\nanterior end would terminate in the orbito-sphenoid.\r\n\r\nThe lateral ridges appear to correspond with what Prof. Huxley has\r\ndescribed in the Ostrich as the ridge indicative of a supra-presphenoid\r\nossification pointed out by Kölliker. The groove which is here noticed\r\non the cerebral surface may indicate the same division. If so, the\r\nupper and anterior part of the mass would be the ethmoid.\r\n\r\nThis mass offers a considerable resemblance to the frontal portion\r\nof the skull of a dolphin (_e. g._ Delphinus delphis) from which the\r\nmaxillary, premaxillary, palatine and nasal bones have been removed.\r\nBut in the Porpoise the mesial ridge dividing the cerebral hemispheres\r\nis not prolonged so far forward as in the Pterodactyle; the cranial\r\nbones are often as smooth on the inside. Notwithstanding Wagner's\r\nassurance that the Pterodactyle skull is very like a Monitor's, he\r\nwould have looked in vain for an ossification in Monitor, Iguana, or\r\nother Lizards, comparable with this mass. And although the brain is\r\nclosed in front by bones in Serpents, it is by the frontal bones,\r\nwhich form a covering for nearly the whole of the conical cerebrum.\r\nNor in the Crocodile is there any ossified mass in front of the brain,\r\nalthough the brain approximates nearer to Birds than is the case with\r\nother living Reptiles. Among Birds such a structure as that of the\r\nPterodactyle is characteristic, but no bird has it so massive and\r\nmammal-like, though an approximation is made in some thick-skulled\r\nbirds like _Ciconia marabou_. And in birds it usually is prolonged much\r\nfurther forward than appears to have been the case with Pterodactyle,\r\nwhere from the rapid tapering of the mass in front it appears to have\r\nended in a vertical ridge like that in Parrots and Birds with a\r\nmoveable beak. In Birds there is usually a median ridge dividing the\r\ncerebral hemispheres, but there is also often a small olfactory lobe\r\nprolonged in front of the cerebrum, to which nothing analogous is\r\nindicated in these fossils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL MOULD OF THE BRAIN CAVITY OF A CAMBRIDGE ORNITHOSAURIAN[U].\r\n(Cast.)\r\n\r\nPl. 11.\r\n\r\n[Footnote U: For the opportunity of making this description, I am\r\nindebted to the kindness of John Francis Walker, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.,\r\nF.C.S., &c., who some time since forwarded to me the whole of his rarer\r\nOrnithosaurian remains for description in the Geological Magazine,]\r\n\r\nThe original specimen is in the collection of J. F. Walker, Esq., of\r\nSidney Sussex College. When found it only displayed the front of the\r\ncerebral hemispheres, and Mr. Walker generously gave me permission to\r\nremove the investing cancellous bone and phosphate of lime, and thus\r\nexhibit the form of the cerebrum and its relations to the cerebellum.\r\nThe lower part of the brain is not preserved. But adherent to the sides\r\nof the fossil are still left parts of the temporal bones, and part of\r\nthe bone at the back of the orbit which closes in the brain. The form\r\nof the cerebellum is not quite perfect behind, but it must have been\r\nunusually small.\r\n\r\nThe cerebral lobes taken together are much wider from side to side than\r\nfrom back to front, and have a transverse elliptical outline, except\r\nfor the mesial notch behind for the cerebellum. The lobes are a little\r\nflattened above, and divided from each other by a deep mesial groove,\r\nwhich makes each lobe convex from side to side. They are well rounded\r\nat the front and at the sides, and are a little compressed towards each\r\nother below in the region of the orbits. Behind they become covered\r\nsuperiorly as in birds with a greatly thickened part of the squamosal\r\nand parietal bones. The surface of the cerebrum is smooth. There is\r\nno indication of a pineal gland. The cerebellum is small, like a pea\r\nbetween two filberts. It is sub-hemisphercal, is placed close against\r\nthe cerebrum, and appears to give off narrow lateral parts, like\r\nthose seen in many birds, only that they abut against the back of the\r\ncerebral lobes as in the Hare and some Mammals. In no reptile is there\r\na brain in which the cerebrum embraces the front of the cerebellum,\r\nor in which it attains to such an enormous size. Fœtal Mammals (_e.\r\ng._ the horse and the sheep), even when they have attained to a\r\nconsiderable bulk, and many adult mammals, still have the optic lobes\r\ndividing the cerebrum from the cerebellum as in Reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe only Mammal which shows any near approximation to this brain is\r\nthe _Ornithorhynchus_, in which the cerebellum is very small, but the\r\ncerebrum is not so well rounded in front. The form approximates to\r\nthe brain in Man. But with Birds the resemblance is so close--with\r\nthe owl and the goose--that there is no character to distinguish the\r\nbrain of the fossil animal from those of the recent ones. A section of\r\nthe cerebrum in this specimen entirely corresponds with a section of\r\nthe brain-cavity in the second skull described, as does the backward\r\nextension of the cerebrum with the extent of the cerebral cavity, and\r\nthe narrow cerebellum with the narrow channel parallel to the walls\r\nof the foramen magnum, as in _Gallus domesticus_ and Birds. The front\r\nof the brain corresponds with the cast of the front of the cerebral\r\nlobes taken from the Ethmo-sphenoid mass. Thus the specimens agree\r\namong themselves, and prove the Pterodactyle to have had a brain\r\nindistinguishable from that of a Bird. And when it is remembered how\r\ndistinctive this kind of brain is, and that it approximates rather\r\ntowards the higher Mammals than towards Reptiles, the fact attains\r\nunusual importance in determining the Pterodactyle's place in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n?NEURAL ARCH OF SACRAL VERTEBRA, ?VOMER.\r\n\r\nPl. 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrontal(?) Owen. _Palæontographical_, 1859\r\n\r\nPl. 4, fig. 6, 7, 8.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_    10      1-3\r\n\r\nIn 1859 Prof. Owen described with doubt as the Frontal\r\nof Pterodactyle, a symmetrical bone. A smaller but more perfect\r\nspecimen has since been obtained for the Woodwardian\r\nMuseum; and a fragment of intermediate size is in the rich\r\ncollection of the Rev. T. G. Bonney. From the descriptions\r\nalready given it is impossible for it to be the frontal. There\r\nis no proof that it is a skull bone. If of Pterodactyle the\r\ncompressed lateral spaces could only be part of the nasal passages,\r\nor the impressions of a palatine or pterygoid articulation.\r\nAnd as the external surface of every specimen is keeled, and\r\nas the palatal surface of the upper jaw of every known Greensand\r\nPterodactyle is keeled, and as the concavities slightly converge\r\nto the keel, it might be a bone from the under side of the\r\nhead,--the vomer.\r\n\r\nThe smallest specimen is a compressed sub-semicircular bone\r\n1-1/4 inch long, 9/16 inch high, and a 1/4 inch thick. The under surfaces\r\nconverge to form a strong keel, which is flattened off behind.\r\nAbove this, the posterior third of the bone is compressed\r\nobliquely to half the thickness, as though a bone had over-lapped\r\nthis area on each side. If the oval spaces are nares, that\r\nbone might have been the pterygoid or palatine. Three-fifths\r\nof the remainder of the bone are taken up by the smooth oval\r\ndepressions, which might be the inner walls of the nares; and above\r\nthis is a margin of bone widening into the triangular compressed\r\npart in front, which, if the fossil is rightly determined, must have\r\nfitted into the posterior end of the maxillary or anterior end of\r\nthe palatine bones.\r\n\r\nA specimen collected by the Rev. T. G. Bonney is preserved on\r\nthe sacral side of a left _os innominatum_ with the keel downward.\r\nIt appears to show a sutural surface from which an anterior part\r\nhas come away. And if this specimen is compared with the\r\nneural arch of the sacral vertebra =J=._c_.4.1, it will be found to\r\ncorrespond entirely. It is not impossible that _c_.10.1, 2 may be\r\nvomerine, and _c_.10.3 sacral, but there are no distinctive characters\r\nbetween the specimens to warrant such a determination.\r\n\r\n\r\n  QUADRATUM.\r\n\r\n  Pl. II.\r\n\r\n  and Quadrato-Jugal.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_    11      1-4\r\n\r\nIn the Woodwardian Museum are two distal ends of the quadrate bone and\r\ntwo other fragments showing the quadrato-jugal with it.\r\n\r\n_Quadrate._ The smallest specimen is 1/2 an inch over the articular\r\nsurface for the lower jaw and a quarter of an inch thick. It is concave\r\nfrom side to side in front where it shows a large pneumatic foramen\r\nnear the basal end; it is bent from the articulation a little backward.\r\nIt is convex behind; and between the foramen and the articulation sends\r\ninward and forward a great wing like that of the quadratum in birds.\r\nThe specimens are broken short off and do not show any articulation\r\nabove, where the bone contracts.\r\n\r\nThe distal articulation is double, like two long cones placed together;\r\nthat in front having the base outward, while the hinder one has the\r\nbase on the inner side. The largest specimen, which is much broken,\r\nshows the articulation half an inch thick.\r\n\r\n_Quadrato-jugal._ This is a thin flat squamous bone, apparently of a\r\ntransverse diamond shape, which is anchylosed to the anterior lateral\r\nmargin of the quadrate, at right angles to the articulation. The lower\r\nmargin is straight, as is the upper anterior margin, which appears to\r\nhave received the malar bone above.\r\n\r\nThe upper posterior side is broken, but shows a large foramen near\r\nto the side of the quadrate. The base of the diamond is at the\r\narticulation, and at its apex is a small fragment of smooth surface,\r\neither part of a foramen, or the orbit of the eye.\r\n\r\nIn this specimen the articulation, which is broken, is about 3/4 of an\r\ninch wide, 3/8 of an inch thick. The remaining piece of the quadrate is\r\nan inch long. The quadrato-jugal is an inch and 3/16 high, and between\r\nits broken ends 1-3/4 inch long. It is thick and strong where joining\r\nthe quadrate, but the rest of the bone is about an 1/8th of an inch\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nThe quadrate bone is Avian in possessing a pneumatic foramen, and Avian\r\nin the form of so much of the distal end as is preserved, and in the\r\narticulation for the lower jaw. The process which it sends inward on\r\nthe inside is probably for the pterygoid bone, after the manner of\r\nBirds. Before anchylosis with the quadrato-jugal bone set in, as may\r\nbe seen in =J=._c_.11.4, the union was made by a hemispherical knob on\r\nthe outside of the quadrate, as in _Gallus domesticus_. The squamose\r\nquadrato-jugal is a distinctive character.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ?PTERYGOID END OF PALATINE BONE.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 12.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_    14      1-2\r\n\r\nThis determination is conjectural. Its form is such as would make it\r\nprobable that it is part of the head. A more perfect specimen is seen\r\nin =J=._c_.1.2.7.\r\n\r\nThe best specimen is a compressed sub-quadrate fragment of bone\r\nterminating at one end in a long reniform articular surface, and at\r\nthe other end in a fracture where the bone is rapidly thickening. A\r\nside, regarded as the outer one, is flattened, being slightly concave\r\nin length, and slightly convex from side to side. The form of the\r\ninner side of the bone is determined by the inward curve of the thick\r\npart of the articular surface, which sends a rounded ridge obliquely\r\non to the side, so that while it is concave from side to side at the\r\narticulation, at the fracture it is convex from side to side. All the\r\nspecimens are large, the articulation being not less than an inch long.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PREMAXILLARY BONES\r\n\r\n  Pl. 12.\r\n\r\nappear to be developed as in birds. An account of their structure will\r\nbe found in the notes on the species, page 112.\r\n\r\n                   ------------\r\n\r\n  OS ARTICULARE AND PROXIMAL END OF LOWER JAW.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 12.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_    12      1-6\r\n\r\nProf. Owen has described in a 'Palæontographical' monograph the\r\nproximal end of a mandible in which the sutures are obliterated.\r\nBut there is one specimen of a young right ramus showing the inner\r\nand under part of the mandible to be the surangular bone which\r\nunites with the angular or outer bone by a longitudinal and vertical\r\nsuture traversing on the inner side the great upper groove; and on\r\nthe surangular the greater part of the articular bone rests. The\r\narticulation is strong and double, consisting of a deep transverse\r\nhollow, bounded by a strong over-locking ridge in front and a slight\r\nridge behind; and this area is divided into two tapering furrows by\r\na strong oblique and rounded crest, which passes from behind inward\r\nand forward. Just behind the articulation is a ?pneumatic aperture,\r\nand then the upper surface tapers to the under surface, forming a\r\nheel, of which one specimen measuring an inch deep on the inside of\r\nthe articulation has 3/4 of an inch still left and is more than 1/4\r\ninch thick at the fracture. In a specimen belonging to the Rev. T. G.\r\nBonney the outside of the jaw is 11/16 of an inch deep, and under the\r\narticulation 5/16 of an inch deep. The articular area is 3/4 of an inch\r\nwide and 6/16 of an inch long.\r\n\r\nSeven specimens indicate four species.\r\n\r\nThe proximal end of the lower jaw is entirely Avian. The pneumatic\r\naperture, as in birds, is placed behind the articulation, which is\r\nshaped as in many birds. Commonly in Ornithosaurians the bones are\r\nanchylosed and all trace of sutures obliterated, as in most birds. In\r\nthe Goose, however, the six elements of each side are sometimes as\r\nreadily separated as in reptiles. And in some Pterodactyles the bones\r\nseparate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DENTARY BONE\r\n\r\nPl. 12.\r\n\r\nThe dentary bone consists of a single piece, as in birds and\r\nchelonians; and differs from both in being provided with teeth. It is\r\ndescribed under the species O. machærorhynchus, page 113.\r\n\r\n                   ------------\r\n\r\n  THE TEETH.\r\n\r\n  Pl. 12.\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_    17      1-39\r\n\r\nThe first three teeth are usually larger than those which are\r\nplaced behind them, in this respect rather resembling some fossil\r\nreptiles than Dolphins, and presenting a character like that seen\r\nin the Dimorphodon. They are placed in oblique oval sockets. They\r\nhave a single fang like Cetaceans, Edentates, Reptiles, and like\r\nthe premaxillary teeth of Mammals. Cambridge specimens of jaws are\r\nnot sufficiently perfect to show whether the teeth are limited\r\nto the premaxillary bone; but this appears to be the case in\r\n_Pterodactylus crassirostris_ (Goldf.), and probably in _Ornithocheirus\r\ncompressirostris_ (Owen), [_Palæontographical Society_, 1851, Pl. 27],\r\nand is so regarded by Professor Owen in his later writings. Yet the\r\nsignificance of this fact seems to have been forgotten, and Cuvier's\r\ndictum about their teeth still has influence. He says, \"The teeth, by\r\nwhich the examination of an animal ought always to be commenced, here\r\npresent nothing equivocal. They are all simple, conical, and nearly\r\nalike, as in the crocodiles, monitors, and other lizards.\" But, on the\r\none hand, the Dolphins demonstrate that a mammal might have similar\r\nteeth even in the maxillary bone; and, on the other hand, since teeth\r\nin the premaxillary bone always are single-fanged, and commonly have\r\na simple sub-conical crown, there is absolutely no evidence in the\r\nteeth of the affinities of the animal, which, so far as this portion\r\nof its economy went, might as well have been a fish or a mammal as\r\nanything else. In the succession there is nothing very distinctive.\r\nIn the Crocodile one tooth comes up under another, as is commonly\r\nthe case with mammals; and in mammals the fangs of the old teeth are\r\noften partially absorbed so that the teeth drop out into the mouth. In\r\nthe Pterodactyle the new teeth came up on the inner side, as in the\r\nIchthyosauria--a tribe of animals as singular in their affinities as\r\nthe Ornithosauria. Occasionally specimens show a small furrow on the\r\ninner side of the fang, indicating absorption, but there is nothing\r\nto show how many times the teeth were renewed: in the Dolphins there\r\nis but one set, and in Crocodiles the teeth are replaced many times.\r\nIn form and size the teeth are very variable. They are directed\r\nobliquely forward, and are curved backward and inward. They taper\r\nin an elongate cone, compressed from side to side, flattened on the\r\noutside, moderately convex on the inside; rarely the sides meet in a\r\nridge after the plan of Pliosaurus, Megalosaurus, Dakosaurus, &c.;\r\nmore frequently the lateral margins round into each other. Usually\r\nthe enamel is quite smooth, sometimes, as in No. 1, it is finely\r\nstriated and wrinkled. Some teeth are nearly circular and some quite\r\nstraight. The ovate fang contracts below, conically, and is closed,\r\nleaving a long hollow pulp-cavity in its interior. Nos. 9, 10 show the\r\nmarks of the successional teeth on their inner sides. No. 11 appears\r\nto have had the crown slightly worn at the tip during the animal's\r\nlifetime. In transverse section of the crown the tooth structure\r\nresembles Ichthyosaurus, Cetaceans, and Bats. The dentine is filled\r\nwith calciferous tubes which radiate as in Ichthyosaurus, and towards\r\nthe centre of the tooth are seen in transverse section to present\r\nmany angles, almost like radiated corpuscles. They are separated by\r\ninterspaces of their own width, and run towards the circumference,\r\nsometimes straight and sometimes wavy, parallel to each other. They\r\nsend off branches usually at right angles which anastomose with the\r\nadjoining tubes. The dentine is in concentric layers, and shows layers\r\nof sub-circular cells as in the teeth of Mammals. The enamel is a thin\r\ntransparent layer with fewer and finer tubes than the dentine.\r\n\r\n                   ------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUMMING UP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of the structure of the Ornithosaurians of the Cambridge\r\nGreensand has now been told, and it only remains to gather up the\r\nthreads of their affinities and determine the Pterodactyle's place\r\nin nature. But before doing so, so various in importance are the\r\ncharacters enumerated, that I would first offer a few remarks on the\r\nclassificational value of characters among the Reptilia, with which\r\nPterodactyles have been most commonly grouped.\r\n\r\nThe naturalist who only examines organisms now living on the earth,\r\nsymbolizes to himself, by the term Reptile, a definite sum of\r\ncharacters, with definite subdivisions and subordinate grouping, to\r\nwhich the extinct types of life extricated from the rocks cannot\r\nentirely be adapted. When the fragmentary, and often isolated or\r\nill-associated, bones of fossilized animals are contrasted with\r\ncorresponding bones in the skeletons of Serpents, Crocodiles, Lizards\r\nand Turtles, not infrequently it is found that the characters\r\nattributed to different Ordinal groups are interlaced in a single\r\nindividual with a type of organization peculiar to itself, and\r\nimportant as are the modifications of existing orders. These characters\r\noccasionally are grouped with others which in living animals had been\r\ndeemed characteristic of Fishes, Amphibia, Birds, and Mammals.\r\n\r\nThe Reptilia of the Palæontologist is therefore a vast and provisional\r\ngroup, ever acquiring new characters, to which no diagnosis can be\r\napplied. And although certain empirical characters have served to\r\nallocate the specimens in their several orders, in general with\r\nsufficient accuracy, yet from the imperfect preservation of some of the\r\nremains, or the imperfect extent to which their structures are known,\r\nand the want of recognised canons by which to measure their relative\r\nvalues, it has not been possible to discuss the relations of the\r\nseveral orders to each other or with the larger groups on which some of\r\nthem impinge.\r\n\r\nClassifications represent more or less faithfully the gradational\r\nincrease in the sum of the characters of an organism, as well as the\r\nincrease in importance that those character severally attain. Thus\r\ngathering, so far as may be, from the chaos of individuals, _a common\r\nplan of structures_ on which the genus, order, or class is moulded\r\nfrom a less specialized group of organs. The fundamental structures\r\nof a vertebrate animal, so far as their persistent importance can be\r\nmeasured, are, those connected with\r\n\r\n    I. Perpetuating the race.\r\n\r\n   II. Construction of the brain.\r\n\r\n  III. Circulation and oxidation of the blood.\r\n\r\n   IV. Locomotion, i.e. skeleton, muscles, &c.\r\n\r\nAnd these characteristics are for the most part so interlinked, that\r\nit becomes difficult to assign to one order of animals a relative\r\nsuperiority over another order; since when a single set of organs is\r\nprominently developed in one group it often happens that another set of\r\norgans has a like pre-eminence in an allied group. Thus among reptiles\r\nit might be considered that\r\n\r\n  _Crocodiles_ have the best hearts, and _Turtles_ the best lungs.\r\n\r\nAnd since these structures in their functions severally modify and\r\ndetermine the use of other structures, the meaning that terms like\r\nCrocodilian and Chelonian really have is that they represent the\r\naspect of Reptilian organization when seen through the specialization\r\nof respiration, or circulation of the blood. The soft parts thus\r\ndetermining the nutrition and function of the muscles and skeleton,\r\nanatomists in examining the bones of extinct animals are accustomed to\r\nreverse the order of their inferences, and infer from modifications of\r\nthe skeleton what had been the characters of the soft and more vital\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nOn the presumed accuracy of this method of research rest many results\r\nof Comparative Anatomy. But since the shapes of bones are determined by\r\nthe muscles as well as by inheritance, it is always to be remembered\r\nthat a similar form of bone may obtain in different orders or classes\r\nof animals, as the result of a similar function in a special region of\r\nthe body. Such resemblances are familiar to anatomists. Hence much\r\ncaution is required from the Palæontologist to distinguish between\r\nthe characteristics of a group, and the extent to which they may be\r\nmodified by function. This distinction is the first principle of\r\nclassification. But it is always difficult to estimate the importance\r\nof characters in fragments of bones or parts of skeletons, and the\r\ndifficulty is increased by the fact that if what appears to be but a\r\nfunctional modification should pervade all the species, it becomes\r\na characteristic of the group, and its power of modifying the other\r\norgans in a peculiar way has to be considered.\r\n\r\nThus for all practical purposes birds may be said to be characterized\r\nby wings, which almost acquire the dignity of class characters from\r\ntheir influence on the respiratory function. But in some birds it has\r\nbeen thought that no bone of the fore-limb was ever developed[V]; and\r\nthe difference between such a phenomenon and the wing of a Swift, for\r\nexample, is one almost of infinity, as compared with any other aspect\r\nthat the anterior limb might have assumed. Therefore, since a bird may\r\npart with its fore-limbs and yet remain a bird, I infer that it might\r\napply its fore-limbs to the ground, become a quadruped, and be a bird\r\nstill. And if in this process the other structures remained unchanged,\r\nno one would regard the modification as more than an ordinal one. But\r\nshould the vertebræ change also, or the pelvis, or the covering of\r\nthe integument, or the jaws become toothed, then, although the heart\r\nand lungs and brain of the imaginary animal retained their class\r\ncharacters, the functional differences being more than those of an\r\norder would constitute it a sub-class.\r\n\r\n[Footnote V: According to Prof. Owen, in Dinornis.]\r\n\r\nIn the same way it is conceivable that serpents may have existed with\r\nwell-developed limbs, and if they retained their other characters the\r\nlimbed forms would constitute a sub-order of serpents; but if to these\r\ncharacters they added a closed palate united to the cranium, they would\r\nconstitute a new order of reptiles. A chelonian might be entirely\r\ndeprived of its bony covering, and it would still be a chelonian,\r\ndiffering only as a separate family. So that structures which to the\r\neye appear fundamental may be lost without affecting an animal's\r\nsystematic position, just as animals while resembling each other in\r\nform may possess dissimilar organization.\r\n\r\nEven with the living or typical Reptilia, naturalists are divided as\r\nto the number of ordinal groups into which they naturally fall. It is\r\nhowever generally agreed that the Amphibia or Dipnoa of Fitzinger, have\r\nno near affinity with the true reptiles. Milne-Edwards, Van der Hoeven\r\nand Agassiz make the remainder into three orders, as did Cuvier:\r\n\r\n  Chelonia,\r\n  Sauria,\r\n  Ophidia.\r\n\r\nStannius, Gray, Owen and Huxley, on the other hand, by dividing the\r\nSaurians make four orders, to which Dr Günther by his description of\r\nSphenodon has given evidence of a fifth:\r\n\r\n  Crocodilia,\r\n  Chelonia,\r\n  Sauria,\r\n  Ophidia,\r\n  (Rhynchocephalia.)\r\n\r\nDe Blainville in a remarkable classification (1816), made three orders,\r\nChelonians, Emydosaurians [crocodiles], and Saurophidians; the latter\r\ngroup being subdivided into Saurians and Ophidians.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Handbuch der Anatomie der Wirbelthiere\" Stannius unites the\r\nCrocodilia and Chelonia into a group called Monimostylica; while of\r\nthe Sauria and Ophidia he makes another group called Streptostylica.\r\nSimilar groups were made by Dr Gray, and named Cataphracta and\r\nSquamata. They are identical with the \"cuirassed\" and \"scaly\" reptiles\r\nof Dumeril and Bibron.\r\n\r\nThe _Astylica_ (Sphenodon) have no penis.\r\n\r\nThe _Streptostylica_ have a double penis, lungs simplified at the\r\ndistal end into a mere air-bladder, brains with a moderately elongated\r\ncerebrum, the palate mesially open, scales, leathery shell to the egg\r\ncut through by a tooth on the premaxillary bone.\r\n\r\nThe _Monimostylica_ have a single penis, lungs well subdivided,\r\nventricle of heart partly [turtles] or entirely divided [crocodiles],\r\nbrains having the cerebrum broad or high, a closed palate, scutes, a\r\ncalcareous shell to the egg.\r\n\r\nThus the chief differences between Turtles and Crocodiles on the one\r\nhand, and Lizards and Serpents on the other hand, are not so much\r\nin the fundamental vital structures, though these undergo changes\r\neven in the families, as in the different ways in which the muscles\r\nand skeleton are modified. The typical lizards diverge widely from\r\nthe crocodiles, and in those osteological features which admit of\r\ncomparison they make at least as near an approach to the Chelonians.\r\nBut leaving the limbs and pectoral and pelvic girdles out of\r\nconsideration, lizards find their natural place side by side with the\r\nserpents.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made by Palæontologists to incorporate the new\r\nordinal groups which they have been compelled to create for some\r\nfossils, along with the true Reptilia; but such a proceeding destroys\r\nthe value of the term Reptile as a measure of a known organization. In\r\nthe absence of knowledge of the brains of Dinosaurs, Ichthyosaurs, and\r\nDicynodonts, their union with the Reptilia can only have a stagnating\r\neffect on Palæontology, for there is no proof that they are Reptiles\r\nin the same sense as are Crocodiles or Chameleons: while their bones\r\nbeing used as standards of Reptilian structure in comparisons, they\r\nadjudicate the place in nature of other animals by an authority which\r\nhas never been established.\r\n\r\nBefore any inference can be drawn from the forms of bones in extinct\r\nanimals, their relations to vital structures and to way of life must\r\nbe known in animals which still live. This may give some clue both\r\nto their functional significance and to the extent to which they are\r\ninherited and not directly attributable to function. But an idea of\r\nthe morphological value of the bones of living animals is only gained\r\nby comparing them with the remains of their extinct allies, tracing\r\nthe now imitative structure back to its origin in a function which has\r\nceased to be displayed.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen in his \"Comparative Anatomy of the Vertebrates\" (1866)\r\nadmits nine orders of Reptiles, five of which are extinct, some of the\r\nextinct orders being supposed to rank lower, while others are higher\r\nthan the living types. They are arranged in this way,\r\n\r\n      * Pterosauria,\r\n      * Dinosauria,\r\n        Crocodilia,\r\n        Ophidia,\r\n        Lacertilia,\r\n        Chelonia\r\n      * Anomodontia,\r\n      * Sauropterygia,\r\n      * Ichthyopterygia.+\r\n\r\n  * Extinct.\r\n\r\n  + Prof. Owen, _Comp. Anat._ Vol. I. p. 7-9, defines his\r\n      sub-classes. At p. 15, in the details of the orders, he puts\r\n      Ichthyosaurus in the 5th sub-class _Monopnoa_. But at p. 50,\r\n      treating of the vertebral column of Ichthyosaurus, it is written of\r\n      as an extinct order of _Dipnoal_ reptiles. The Dipnoa then\r\n      would include\r\n\r\n        Ichthyosauria,\r\n        Batrachia,\r\n        Labyrinthodontia,\r\n        Ganocephala.\r\n\r\n      But Ichthyosaurus obviously belongs to Haeckel's group Monocondylia.\r\n\r\nIn what characters the Ichthyosaurs are lower than living reptiles I\r\nhave been unable to discover. The palate may be better compared with\r\na struthious bird than with a reptile; and the pectoral girdle may be\r\nbetter compared with the Ornithodelphia than with a reptile, while all\r\nthe trunk-vertebræ have ribs such as are associated in living animals\r\nwith a four-celled heart. But if it is a lower animal type than living\r\nreptilia, the student will ask, how much lower? does it descend to\r\nthe Dipnoa, and prove to be the missing link between the Amphibia and\r\nReptilia? and wherein is the evidence? Or does it not with Dicynodonts\r\nand Dinosaurs rather form an outlying class uniting the reptiles with\r\nthe mammals.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, when Pterosauria and Dinosauria are placed above\r\nliving reptiles, we are compelled to ask how much are they above, or\r\nwhat are the characters which bind them to the Reptilia at all? No\r\nsatisfactory evidence has ever been adduced to show that the Dinosauria\r\nare Reptiles. And of the claim of the Pterodactyles to such a position,\r\nthe facts detailed and now summarised will be the best evidence.\r\n\r\nThe highest structure shown in these remains is the brain-case. The\r\ncavity for the brain is in every respect like that in the skull of a\r\nbird. It resembles brains of a high type in having the cerebral lobes\r\nconvex in front; since, in the lower mammals, there is a resemblance\r\nto reptiles in the conical form of the cerebrum; while the brains even\r\nof some of the placental mammals are not well distinguished from those\r\nof reptiles. Although the brain of the Ornithorhynchus is entirely\r\nmammalian, it is more like the brain of a reptile than is the brain\r\nof the Pterodactyle. No evidence of affinities could be adduced which\r\nwould outweigh this. Taken by itself it would lead us to anticipate for\r\nthe Pterodactyle those vital structures which birds have in common.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the brain are the pneumatic perforations in\r\nthe bones. They are seen in the lower jaw, the quadrate bone, in the\r\nwhole of the vertebral column, in all the bones of the fore-limb,\r\nexcepting one or two fragments, in the scapula and coracoid, in the\r\nos innominatum, in the femur and in the tibia. In such of the bones\r\nas can be compared, the pneumatic perforation is usually situated in\r\nBirds as it is in Pterodactyles. In Birds the bones are filled with\r\nair through these perforations, and as a principle the greater the\r\nmotion of the animal, the greater is the number of bones filled with\r\nair. This air is received from the air-sacs which receive it from the\r\nlungs, and return it through the lungs again. There is thus in birds\r\na sort of supplemental lung-system, which circulates air through the\r\nbody. Nothing of the kind exists in any other class of animals. The\r\nrespiratory system in birds is more perfect and complex than in the\r\nother vertebrata, and, as a result, the temperature of the blood on the\r\nwhole is hotter.\r\n\r\nIn Pterodactyles the reticulate character of the perforations proves\r\nthat they were pneumatic, and supplied the bones with air. The fact\r\nthat the bones were supplied with air, necessitates an elaborate system\r\nof air-sacs to furnish the supply. And the existence of these air-sacs\r\nspeaks incontestably to bronchial tubes opening on the surface of the\r\nlungs to supply them, and to the existence of lungs essentially like\r\nthose of birds. The outward and backward direction of the coracoid\r\nbones may indicate that the lungs were larger than in a bird.\r\n\r\nThe circulation of air through the bird's body has relation to rapid\r\nmotion through the atmosphere, which necessarily produces more rapid\r\nrespiration than would comparative quiescence. The same inference must\r\nbe applied to the Pterodactyles. But rapid respiration only means more\r\nrapid oxidation of the blood, and conversion of the purple cruorine\r\ninto scarlet cruorine,--that is, the conversion of venous blood into\r\narterial blood. And if venous blood is converted into arterial blood by\r\na lung-apparatus like that of a bird, and with a rapidity like that in\r\na bird, there must be a circulation of the blood as rapid as in birds.\r\nSuch a circulation is only maintained by a heart with two auricles and\r\ntwo ventricles. Therefore Pterodactyles had the heart like that of\r\nbirds and mammals.\r\n\r\nNow, since the temperature of the blood is chiefly dependent on\r\nrespiration and circulation, and Pterodactyles had respiratory and\r\ncirculatory organs which in living animals produce hot blood, it\r\nresults that they were hot-blooded animals.\r\n\r\nThus the heart and lungs are exactly such as would have been inferred\r\nfrom the brain, and, like it, they are avian. And so important are\r\nthese vital structures all taken together, that the inference from them\r\nupon an animal's affinities would overbear all other evidence that\r\ncould be adduced except reproduction; for they demonstrate the plan on\r\nwhich an animal was built, and are the motor power which enabled it to\r\nuse its skeleton in a way that stamped upon it a peculiar form.\r\n\r\nIn the head such structures as are preserved conform with slight\r\nvariations to the avian plan. Other Ornithosaurians show in the parts\r\nwhich are not preserved in Cambridge specimens some characters which\r\nare not avian; they are in part as much mammalian as reptilian, and\r\nin a few points entirely reptilian. But it might be misleading to\r\ntake German specimens into consideration in forming an estimate of\r\nthe Pterodactyles of the Cambridge Greensand, which were probably a\r\ndifferent ordinal group, and may have had material differences in\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThe vertebral column as a whole is distinctive.\r\n\r\nThe neck and sacrum are mammalian, and the tail reptilian. The\r\nprocœlous vertebræ are characteristic of reptiles, but in some animals,\r\nas Chelonians, they vary in different regions of the body; and among\r\namphibians the character is inconstant in genera nearly allied.\r\n\r\nThe hind-limb is in part mammalian and in part avian; if there be any\r\nreptilian characters in the foot, they are not less mammalian.\r\n\r\nThe os innominatum is avian and mammalian.\r\n\r\nThe pectoral girdle is avian.\r\n\r\nThe fore-limb is avian and mammalian.\r\n\r\nThe wing-finger is distinctive, though formed on the avian plan.\r\n\r\nThus, if with an avian basis some parts of the skeleton present points\r\nof agreement with reptiles, in other points there are resemblances\r\nwith mammals not less characteristic. These phænomena do not show that\r\nin so far the animal is a mammal or a reptile, but only that mammals,\r\nornithosaurians, and reptiles have had a common origin, and that while\r\nthey have been differentiated so as to form separate classes they have\r\nseverally retained characters which formerly were united in one class.\r\nIt is a skeleton intermediate between reptiles and mammals, and well\r\ndistinguished by mammalian, reptilian, and peculiar characters, from\r\nbirds. It therefore forms a parallel group with birds, displaying\r\nthe ornithic organization in a differently modified skeleton. Yet it\r\ndiffers more from existing birds than they differ among themselves,\r\nfor the discrepancies are in points of structure in which all existing\r\nbirds agree: they are in having teeth, in the procœlous centrum, in the\r\nseparate condition of the carpal and metacarpal (and of the tarsal and\r\nmetatarsal) bones; in having more than two bones in the fore-arm, in\r\nthe sacrum formed of few vertebræ, in the expanded pubic (and prepubic)\r\nbones, in a long neck to the femur, and in the modification of the wing\r\nby the great development of the phalanges of one finger.\r\n\r\nI therefore regard the Pterodactyles as forming a group of equal value\r\nwith birds, for which group the name Ornithosauria is here used.\r\nIt cannot form a separate class, because they have a fundamental\r\norganization in common; and it cannot form an order of birds, because\r\nits differences from birds are greater than those of an order. It\r\nis a group which itself probably includes several orders, and must\r\nconstitute a sub-class, which finds its place in nature side by side\r\nwith birds and between mammals and reptiles, thus:--\r\n\r\n  Mammalia. \\\r\n            |\r\n            | Ornithosauria.

The centrum alone is between 9 and 10 inches\r\nlong and 8 inches deep. It is named Streptospondylus, but constitutes\r\na new group of Ornithosaurians. Nothing so gigantic exists in the\r\nWoodwardian Museum. Another vertebra of the same or an allied genus has\r\nbeen figured by Prof. Owen as the tympanic bone of ?Iguonodon (Fossil\r\nReptilia of the Wealden, Part 2, pl. 10).]\r\n\r\nIn the species Ornithocheirus nasutus (Seeley), =J=._c_.2.11.1:\r\n\r\nThe premaxillary extends for 6 inches without reaching the nares.\r\n\r\nThe lower jaw is 3/4 of an inch deep at the articulation.\r\n\r\nThe four cervical vertebræ are each 1-1/2 inch long.\r\n\r\nThe sternum measures 1-1/2 inch over the facets for the coracoids.\r\n\r\nThe humerus is 2-1/16 inches over the proximal end, the radial crest\r\nnot being preserved.\r\n\r\nThe coracoid is 1-1/4 inch over the proximal end.\r\n\r\nThe scapula is about 3-1/2 inches long.\r\n\r\nThe proximal carpal (imperfect) is 1-5/8 inch wide.\r\n\r\nThe distal carpal is 1-1/2 inch wide.\r\n\r\nThe lateral carpal is 1-1/4 inch long.\r\n\r\nThe wing-metacarpal is 1-1/4 inch wide at the proximal end, and 7/8\r\ninch wide at the distal end.\r\n\r\nThe proximal end of the first phalange is about 1-5/8 inch wide.\r\n\r\nThe proximal end of the second phalange is less than an inch wide.\r\n\r\nThe claw-phalange (imperfect) is about 1-1/4 inch long.\r\n\r\nThe femur is 4 inches long.\r\n\r\nPutting the animal together, the bones give this size :\r\n\r\n  Head                     1 ft. 3 in. long.\r\n  Neck                           9    \"\r\n  (_Back and sacrum_)    ?  8    \"\r\n  (_Tail_)               ? 10    \"\r\n\r\nWith the hypothetical parts, this would give a length of about 3 ft. 6\r\nin. from the tip of the snout to the tip of the tail. Then\r\n\r\n    Humerus                8 in. long.\r\n    (_Fore-arm_)   ?1 ft.  0    \"\r\n    Carpus                 2    \"\r\n    Metacarpus            10    \"\r\n\r\nWhich, if the fore-limbs were kept together as in ordinary quadrupeds,\r\nwould give a height to the body of about 2 ft. 6 in., but as the limbs\r\nprobably spread in walking as among the bats, the hind-limb would give\r\na better idea of the height of the animal.\r\n\r\n    (Flesh, sacrum, os innominatum). 2 in.\r\n    Femur                            4  \"\r\n    (_Tibia_)                       6  \"\r\n    (Metatarsus, &c.)                1  \"\r\n\r\nWhich would give a height of about 13 inches; and, standing in the\r\nposition of a bird, the height to the crown of the head would be about\r\n2 feet. The majority of the Ornithosaurians of the Cambridge Greensand\r\nare of this size.\r\n\r\nThe spread of the wings, if there were 4 phalanges, would be\r\n\r\n    Body                      10 in. wide.\r\n    Two arms            5 ft.  2    \"\r\n    Two wing fingers    7      0    \"\r\n\r\nGiving a total expanse of about 13 feet. But, from the indications\r\nof the wing-finger, I should incline to think an expanse of 10 feet\r\na truer estimate. The largest species attained to twice this size,\r\nand the smallest was a fourth as large. Another memoir will present\r\ndescriptions and restorations of the Greensand species.\r\n\r\n\r\nHabits.\r\n\r\nThe varying organization of different Ornithosaurians probably depends\r\non the different habits of the tribes. That they could all fly is\r\nprobable from the enormous radial crest to the humerus and the great\r\ndevelopment of the wing-bones, to which a wing-membrane was stretched,\r\ncomparable to that of a Bat in texture, but more comparable to a\r\nBird in its extent. The groups with long hind-legs probably had the\r\nmembrane limited to the bones of the arm, while in the species with\r\nsmall hind-legs it may have attained even as great a development as in\r\nBats, though there is no reason for suspecting that it extended to\r\nthe tail. A Pterodactyle cannot be supposed to have hung itself up by\r\nthe hind-legs as does a Bat, because the hind-claws appear invariably\r\nto be directed forward. A Bat walks upon four legs with considerable\r\nelegance and speed; the wing is folded in, close to the side, so as to\r\nbe scarcely noticed; and the outer claw is free to climb with. There\r\ncan be little doubt but that Pterodactyles walked in a similar way. The\r\nthickened mammilate knob at the proximal end of the first phalange is\r\nwell calculated for contact with the ground. And if it were supposed\r\nthat the large wing-metacarpal bone were only used to support the wing,\r\nand the small metacarpals only used to support the claws by which\r\nthe creature has sometimes been pictured suspending itself, it would\r\nbe difficult to believe that the forces of pressure and tension in\r\nflying so exactly corresponded to the forces manifested in suspension\r\nas to cause the large and the small metacarpals invariably to attain\r\nthe same length. A correspondence of this kind may be presumed to\r\nindicate a correspondence in function; and since the animal did not\r\nfly by means of its claws, the inference is that it walked by means of\r\nthe metacarpal bones. In no other way could the bones have been used\r\nequally. The avian ilium would suggest a probability that they also at\r\ntimes stood erect like birds, from which position they could with more\r\nease expand their wings; nor is such an idea opposed by the resemblance\r\nof some bones of the hind-limb to what obtains in birds, and of the\r\nneck of the femur to what is seen in mammals of great power in the\r\nhind-legs.\r\n\r\nThat they lived exclusively upon land and in air is improbable,\r\nconsidering the circumstances under which their remains are found.\r\nIt is likely that they haunted the sea-shores, and, while sometimes\r\nrowing themselves over the water with their powerful wings, used the\r\nwing-membrane as does the Bat to enclose their prey and bring it to the\r\nmouth. But the superior development of the pneumatic foramina suggest\r\nthat their activity was greater than in ordinary sea-birds.\r\n\r\nThe large Cambridge Pterodactyles probably pursued a more substantial\r\nprey than dragon-flies. Their teeth are well suited for fish, but\r\nprobably fowl and small mammal, and even fruits, made a variety in\r\ntheir food. As the lord of the cliff, it may be presumed to have taken\r\ntoll of all animals that could be conquered with tooth and nail. From\r\nits brain it might be regarded as an intelligent animal. The jaws\r\npresent indications of having been sheathed with a horny covering, and\r\nsome of the species show a rugose anterior termination of the snout\r\nsuggestive of fleshy lips like those of the Bat, and which may have\r\nbeen similarly used to stretch and clean the wing-membrane.\r\n\r\nThe high temperature, coupled with the sub-aerial life, are opposed to\r\nthe idea of the animal having been naked. The undisturbed condition of\r\nthe skeleton and some points of structure are opposed to the idea of\r\ntheir having had large feathers. The absence of such remains does not\r\nfavour the hypothesis of their having been covered with scales, though\r\nin the legs of birds a scaly covering is met with. I should anticipate\r\nfor them a filamentous downy feather, or hair, like a Bat's. The Bat\r\ncombs its hair with its claws, and the Ornithosaurians may have used\r\ntheir claws in a similar way.\r\n\r\nThey cannot be supposed to have been gregarious, from the large number\r\nof species relatively to specimens. The reproduction may have been\r\nmuch the same as in birds; and the young were probably reared with\r\naffectionate care[X].\r\n\r\n[Footnote X: Mr Carruthers has shown me crushed Turtle-like eggs from\r\nthe Stonesfield slate, which in the external pitting of the egg-shell\r\nare not so different from some birds as to preclude a suspicion that\r\nthey might possibly be Ornithosaurian.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The following notes indicate structures in perfect specimens from the\r\nLithographic slate which supplement the fragmentary remains from the\r\nCambridge Greensand_[Y].\r\n\r\n[Footnote Y: The German animals form different family groups. And\r\nit cannot be inferred that the structures seen in them pertained to\r\nCambridge specimens.]\r\n\r\nIn the head, Cambridge specimens show no trace of the parts which are\r\nbetween the brain-cavity and the fore-part of the jaw. The form and\r\ncondition of the orbits, nares, and of the space between them, vary\r\nin German specimens. Some Birds and certain Ruminants, such as deer,\r\nthe giraffe, &c., have an interspace between the orbits and nares\r\ncorresponding to that in some Pterodactyles, but no such perforation\r\nis found in living reptiles. In mammals it appears to be surrounded\r\nby the frontal, nasal, lachrymal, and often by the maxillary bone.\r\nIn birds the bones appear to be the lachrymal, nasal, maxillary and\r\npremaxillary, as is the case with Pterodactyles, except that the nasal\r\nbones would seem sometimes to be excluded. The chief peculiarity of\r\nthe Pterodactyle skull in this region is made by the malar bone (and,\r\naccording to some authors, the maxillary also) sending up a process to\r\nmeet the lachrymal. This is not seen in birds, but is characteristic of\r\nmany mammals and reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe premaxillary bone is single, as in birds and Iguana; but it appears\r\nto attain as great a development as in birds, and to occupy the portion\r\nof the jaw which among reptiles and mammals is made by the maxillary\r\nbone. Owing to the great development of the premaxillary bones, the\r\nexterior nares are placed far back toward the middle of the skull as in\r\nbirds, and not near the tip of the snout as in living reptiles and most\r\nmammals.\r\n\r\nThe orbits in Pterodactyles are surrounded with bone, as is commonly\r\nthe case with mammals and reptiles. Among birds a complete orbit\r\nis seen among the parrots, in which it is completed below by a\r\nprolongation of the outer posterior corner of the frontal, which would\r\ncorrespond to the post-frontal bone, and by the lachrymal bone. Thus\r\nthe malar bone, which in most mammals and reptiles forms an important\r\npart of the lower margin of the orbit, is in birds entirely excluded.\r\nIn Pterodactyles the malar bone is placed between the lachrymal and the\r\npost-frontal process of the frontal bone.\r\n\r\nThe quadrate bone in German Pterodactyles, instead of being vertical\r\nas in birds, stretches obliquely forward below the malar bone, so that\r\nthe articulation for the lower jaw is brought forward to be under the\r\nmiddle of the orbit. In _Pterodactylus Kochi_ and in other species\r\nthere appears to be a process, or small separate triradiate bone,\r\ncomparable to a diminished lacertian post-frontal, and homologous\r\nwith the post-frontal process of the parrots. Its upper branch meets\r\nthe frontal. In some genera the front appears to meet the malar. The\r\nlower branch goes to the front of the quadrate bone, and the backward\r\nbranch goes to the squamosal immediately above the articulation for\r\nthe quadrate bone. Thus it is a post-frontal bone resembling that\r\nof the Iguana, but modified and adapted to a cranium like that of a\r\nbird. Its form and size in the different genera are very variable. No\r\nsimilar development is seen among mammals, where the post-frontals have\r\nprobably ceased to exist. It is a carious point of resemblance, but\r\nfrom the other resemblances to Iguana being so few it is robbed of much\r\nof its force as a mark of affinity, and becomes of interest chiefly as\r\nan evidence of independent persistence of structures.\r\n\r\nThe pterygoid and palatine bones approximate to those of bird and\r\nlizard in Pterodactylus crassirostris. And the bones in Pterodactylus\r\nsuevicus, which Quenstedt names vomera, should rather have been named\r\npalatines. There is a bone in Goldfuss' specimen, between the malar and\r\npalatine, which he identifies with the transverse bone, but it is not\r\nseen in any other specimen.\r\n\r\nThe ribs sometimes appear to articulate by single heads, but in P.\r\ncrassirostris they are apparently articulated as in the Crocodile.\r\nSome species show abdominal ribs like those of some reptiles; but the\r\nsegments of the mammalian sternum and abdominal ribs are to be regarded\r\nas homologous structures. The vertebræ offer considerable variety in\r\nsize and shape, but the greatest variation in number is seen in the\r\ntail, which is sometimes stiff and long, and sometimes short. The\r\npelvic bones show a large amount of variation in different genera,\r\noften appearing to be crocodilian, sometimes lacertian, sometimes\r\nmammalian. In the aim the humerus is variable in the length of the\r\nradial crest, and the metacarpus also varies in length.\r\n\r\nWhen the external similarity of the skeletons of birds is borne\r\nin mind, it is impossible, without disregard of classification\r\naltogether, to place animals differing so widely as do the different\r\nOrnithosaurians in the few genera in which they are at present packed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe orders of Ornithosaurians may be established hereafter. Under the\r\nname Pterosauria, Prof. Owen founded one order which has for its type\r\nthe Pterodactylus longirostris.\r\n\r\nVon Meyer proposed to separate this order into two groups, one with\r\ntwo phalanges in the wing-finger, of which Ornithopterus is the only\r\nexample, forming his Diathri; while the other group, Tetrathri,\r\nor those \"with four fingers, comprised all other Pterosaurians.\r\nThe Tetrathri he again subdivided, following out, as he states,\r\nthe suggestion of Munster and Goldfuss, into _Dentirostres_ or\r\nsuch Pterodactyles as have the jaws furnished with teeth to their\r\nanterior termination; and the _Subulirostres_, or such as want teeth\r\nat the extremities of the jaws. To the former group he left the name\r\nPterodactylus, and to the latter was given the name Rhamphorhynchus.\r\nVon Meyer says that he might easily have made a few more species, as\r\nwill be evident to those who inspect his plates, but he \"believes\r\nthat the students of living animals go too far in their tendency to\r\nsubdivide:\" a fancy that, if indulged in by Palæontologists, would have\r\nthe effect of restoring the old Linnæan groups; and a complaint which,\r\nalthough often heard, has usually come from those who do not readily\r\ndiscern and appraise classificational characters. In Palæontology\r\ngenera are sometimes co-extensive with orders, while species often mean\r\ngenera. It may be wearisome to the collector to be lured on to follow\r\nthe devious ways of a science, but Palæontology, the source whence\r\nthe mysteries of existing nature must unravel their meaning, is the\r\nhandmaid of all nature's truths which have been buried in evolving the\r\nexisting creation; and a duty devolves upon Palæontologists to make the\r\npast an inseparable part of the present, by applying to the two the\r\nsame scientific method.\r\n\r\nA year previous to the formation of Owen's Pterosauria, Bonaparte named\r\nthe Order Ornithosaurii, and divided it into a family--Pterodactylæ,\r\nand a sub-family Pterodactylinæ.\r\n\r\nFitzinger (_Systema Reptilium_, 1843) also used the same ordinal name,\r\nand recognized three genera--\r\n\r\n_Pachyrhamphus_, of which the type is Pterodactylus crassirostris\r\n(Gold.).\r\n\r\n_Pterodactylus_, with the type P. longirostris (Cuv.).\r\n\r\nAnd _Ornithocephalus_, with the type O. brevirostris (Sömm.).\r\n\r\nThese and other attempts at classification all endeavour to subdivide\r\nOrnithosaurians by the head or by the tail. Other characters for\r\nprimary divisions may be obtained from the pelvis.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of German Pterodactyles the ilium extends for a long\r\ndistance in front of the os pubis, and only for a very short distance\r\nbehind the large ischium; and the small pubis from its anterior margin\r\ngives attachment to a large prepubic bone, which resembles in form\r\nthe os pubis of the Crocodile[Z], and is unlike that of the Monotreme.\r\nThese appear to include the long-legged animals with short tails, at\r\npresent called Pterodactyles, and form a well-marked family or order.\r\n\r\n[Footnote Z: Prof. Haughton, from a study of the bones and muscles,\r\ncame to the conclusion that the pubic bones of Crocodiles are the\r\nmarsupial bones.]\r\n\r\nAnother kind of pelvis is that in which the ilium extends a short\r\nway in front of the acetabulum, in which the pelvic bones inclose a\r\nmuch larger space. These include the Cambridge Ornithosaurians, the\r\nRhamphorhynchus, and the Dimorphodon, and form another well-marked\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThese long-tailed Pterodactyles subdivide into three\r\nsub-families--Rhamphorhynchæ, Dimorphodontæ, and Ornithocheiræ. The\r\nfour families may then be defined thus:\r\n\r\n  _Pterodactylæ_. Tail short. Hind-legs long. Ilium narrow, extending\r\n    far anterior to the acetabulum; ischium extending behind the\r\n    acetabulum. Epipubic bones ficiform. Head with the middle holes\r\n    large, often confluent with the exterior nares. Jaws toothed to the\r\n    anterior extremity.\r\n\r\n  _Rhamphorhynchæ_. Tail long and stiff. Hind-legs short. Pubis and\r\n    ischium small, oblique to ilium, which extends less far anteriorly\r\n    than in Pterodactylæ. Epipubic bones narrow and bent; they unite\r\n    mesially and form a three-sided bow in front of the pelvis. Head\r\n    with the middle holes and nares both small. Jaws never toothed to\r\n    the anterior extremity.\r\n\r\n  _Dimorphodontæ_. Tail long and stiff. Hind-legs long. Pubis and\r\n    ischium forming an expanded sheet of bone at right angles with the\r\n    narrow ilium, which extends as far behind as in front [prepubic\r\n    bones triangular (?) attached by the apex of the triangle]. Head\r\n    with the nares and middle holes large. Quadrate bone large. Jaws\r\n    with large teeth at the extremities, and small teeth behind. No\r\n    sacrum.\r\n\r\n  _Ornithocheiræ_. Tail long and flexible. Hind-legs short. Pelvis as\r\n    in Dimorphodontæ. [Epipubic bones with a small attachment, form\r\n    unknown.] Head with the quadrate bone small. Sacrum of not fewer\r\n    than three vertebræ.\r\n\r\nIn the Pterodactylæ the genera are--\r\n\r\n  _Pterodactylus_ (Cuvier), in which the exterior nares are at the\r\n    sides of the face, very large, and only partially, if at all,\r\n    separated by bone from the small middle hole of the head. The head\r\n    is elongated. The neck is long. Among others, it includes the\r\n    species P. longirostris, P. Kochi, P. scolopaciceps, P. longicollum.\r\n\r\n  _Ornithocephalus_ (Sömmerring), in which the anterior nares are\r\n    entirely separated from the middle holes of the head, both being\r\n    small, and the latter exceedingly small. The head is short The\r\n    neck is short. The large ischium appears to be excluded from the\r\n    acetabulum, and the ilium appears to extend less far forward than\r\n    in Pterodactylus[AA].\r\n\r\n[Footnote AA: So far as can be judged from figures, it appears to have\r\nbut three bones in the wing-finger: what Cuvier regarded as a terminal\r\nand fourth joint, the bone _n_, Pl. XXIII. fig. 7, _Oss. Foss._,\r\nappearing to me to be the fibula of the tibia marked _e_. _s_ in the\r\nsame figure would be the terminal phalange, and _r_ the first phalange,\r\nas may be proved by measuring them with those of the other hand,\r\nso that a phalange is missing from between them. Both the terminal\r\nphalanges appear to be hooked at the termination. Goldfuss figures\r\nthe phalanges so as to make the bone which appears to be fibula in\r\nSömmerring and Cuvier look like a fourth phalange.]\r\n\r\n  _Pachyrhamphus_ (Fitzinger). The nares are entirely separated from\r\n    the middle holes of the head; both are large. The head is thick\r\n    and massive. The prepubic bones meet mesially. No evidence of\r\n    the number of phalanges in the wing-finger. The quadrate bone\r\n    is massive, but has small attachment to the skull. Two sacral\r\n    vertebræ. Wing-metacarpal very short. The type is P. crassirostris\r\n    (Goldfuss).\r\n\r\n  _Cycnorhamphus_ (Seeley). Nares very small, looking upward from\r\n    a swan-like beak. The middle hole of the skull very large and\r\n    elongated and lateral. Neck long. Wing-metacarpal long. Four joints\r\n    in the wing-finger. Ilium widening in front. Epipubic bones meeting\r\n    mesially. The type is Pterodactylus suevicus (Quenstedt).\r\n\r\nIn the Rhamphorhynchæ at present there appears to be but one genus\r\nknown:\r\n\r\n  Rhamphorhynchus (von Meyer). The nares and middle holes are both\r\n    small, ovate, of nearly equal size, and close together at the side\r\n    of the head in front of the orbit.\r\n\r\nIn the Dimorphodontæ the only genus is\r\n\r\n  _Dimorphodon_ (Owen). It has the nares enormously large. The middle\r\n    holes are also large.\r\n\r\nIn the Ornithocheiræ the genus is\r\n\r\n  _Ornithocheirus_ (Seeley), in which teeth are prolonged anterior to\r\n    the muzzle, and the palate has a longitudinal ridge.\r\n\r\nWith the osteological illustrations of the Ornithosauria are arranged\r\nsome premaxillary bones, which show varieties of form of the snout.\r\nThese variations of shape serve easily to indicate different species.\r\nAnd the following memoranda from those specimens and other specimens\r\nin the drawers form a synopsis of the species of the Cambridge genera,\r\nwhich may hereafter be fully elucidated from the copious materials in\r\nthe series of associated remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus Sedgwicki (Owen).\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_    13       2\r\n\r\nThe fragment is 2-7/8ths inches long, with the elliptical teeth\r\nopposite to each other, 6 on a side on the palate, and one pair in\r\nfront. The first three teeth are large; behind these the teeth are\r\nabout half the size. The palate is gently convex, with a faint median\r\nridge, and measures from side to side over the fourth and subsequent\r\nsockets 13/16ths of an inch. The height of the jaw at the fourth socket\r\n1-1/4 inch. The sides converge to an acute rounded rostral keel. The\r\njaws appear to have been long. The anterior termination is vascular.\r\n\r\nThe rostral keel figured by Owen Pl. I, fig. 1 _d_, in the 1st Supt.\r\n_Cret. Reptiles_, is not square as represented there, but rounded;\r\nthe sides converge more acutely, and at the ridge the keel is not\r\nhalf so wide as the figure makes it. The enormous size of the third\r\ntooth-socket is partly due to the cracked bone having absorbed\r\nmore phosphate of lime than it could hold, and extended the cracks\r\nto fissures. The type specimen shows that there was another pair\r\nof sockets in front of, but quite close to, those which appear to\r\nterminate the lower jaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n  II.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus Cuvieri (Bowerbank).\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_    15      1-3\r\n\r\nA portion of a premaxillary bone fractured at both ends, and two inches\r\nlong, corresponds with Dr Bowerbank's fossil figured Pl. XXVII. fig. 1,\r\n3, 4, in the Palæontographical volume for 1851. The palate is just as\r\nwide; the median ridge, the same; the teeth the same in shape and as\r\nfar apart. The jaw is of the same depth, but does not deepen so rapidly\r\nbehind. The only other difference is that the sockets of the teeth are\r\nless prominent on the sides, and appear to look more directly down.\r\n\r\nThe ridge in which the converging sides meet is well rounded in a\r\ndentary bone which may have pertained to this species. In the space\r\nof two inches and a quarter are 5 teeth, the posterior four extending\r\nover two inches, the other pair being in front. The palatal surface is\r\n3/4 of an inch broad behind the third tooth, and rather more than 5/8\r\nof an inch broad behind the fourth tooth. The length of the 4th or of\r\nthe 5th sockets is two-thirds that of the second or third. In front of\r\nthe 5th tooth, the jaw is an inch deep, and it tapers in a curve to\r\nthe anterior end. The teeth behind the third have interspaces greater\r\nthan the length of the sockets; that between the 4th and 5th being 3/8\r\nof an inch, while the socket only measures a quarter of an inch long.\r\nBehind the 2nd socket commences the palatal groove, broad in fronts but\r\nnarrowing behind; and its sides instead of diverging as in the type,\r\nare concave so as to form a channel like a straightened _Siliquaria_\r\nshell. The halves of the palate bevel off so as to make a right angle\r\nwith each other, and greater angles with the flat sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n  III.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus machærorhynchus (Seeley).\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c6_   35       1\r\n\r\nDentary bone. Broken at both ends, and wanting all its teeth, this\r\ninteresting fossil shows the suture where its whole length rests on the\r\nangular bone which almost reached to the termination of the beak, quite\r\nunlike what is seen in any German Pterodactyle.\r\n\r\nIt is a narrow mandible, less than three quarters of an inch wide, with\r\nthe alveolar margins parallel. The palatal surface 1-1/2 inch long,\r\nis divided into 3 equal strips; the middle one being a deep glossal\r\ngroove, slightly narrowing in front, and deepening behind, made by two\r\ninclined flat surfaces. The lateral strips are horizontal behind, and\r\nin front slope a little outward. The tooth-sockets are oval, directed\r\noutward, and as long as the interspaces, though these seem to get\r\nlonger behind. In an inch and a quarter there are four teeth. Below\r\nthe teeth, the sides of the jaw are compressed: though nearly parallel\r\nat the hinder fracture, the flattened surfaces approximate in front\r\ntill they meet in a sharp keel, which appears to make an acute angle\r\nof about 45° with the palate; and below, where the jaw is an inch deep\r\nextends for half an inch in front of the suture with the angular bone:\r\nthis suture is straight and irregularly concave, and in an inch and a\r\nquarter approximates to within 5/8ths of an inch of the palate.\r\n\r\n\r\n  IV.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus tenuirostris (Seeley).\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c2_   12       1\r\n\r\nMiddle part of a premaxillary bone fractured behind and in front,\r\nslightly distorted by compression; it is 2-1/8th inches long, and\r\nnearly resembles _O. compressirostris_ (Owen). The palate is about\r\n1/2 an inch wide in front, and 5/8ths of an inch wide behind; it is\r\ncompressed mesially into a strong angular keel, between which and\r\nthe teeth there is a shallow groove on each side. The groove dies\r\naway behind, and the converging parts of the keel occupy the whole\r\nspace between the teeth. The teeth-sockets are small, elliptical, not\r\nopposite to each other, and placed along a distinct flattened tooth\r\narea, which looks downward and outward and separates the palate from\r\nthe side of the jaw. The first pair of sockets preserved are almost\r\n3/16ths of an inch long and 1/16th of an inch wide. The interspace\r\nbetween that tooth and the next tooth behind is 7/16 of an inch.\r\nSeparated by similar interspaces, behind these on one side are two\r\nsockets, and on the other side one socket. The sides are flattened in\r\nfront, and convex behind, (making the section of the jaw lanceolate);\r\nthey are compressed and round into a narrow rostral keel. The height\r\nfrom the palatal ridge to the rostral keel in front is 11/16ths of an\r\ninch; behind it is fractured, but the height was probably 14/16ths of\r\nan inch.\r\n\r\nThe palatal keel, distance of the teeth, and proportions of the jaw,\r\ndistinguish it from O. compressirostris (Owen).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  V.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus Oweni (Seeley).\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet.\r\n   =J=   _c_    20\r\n\r\nThe small piece of premaxillary on which this species is founded\r\nindicates a small animal, and nearly resembles the jaw of _O. microdon_.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely an inch long; nearly 9/16ths inch high behind, and\r\nnearly 7/16ths of an inch high in front, so that it tapers very\r\nrapidly, and could scarcely have been an inch longer in front.\r\n\r\nThe nose is well rounded, but the sides are a little concave, and\r\nbecome well pinched in in the middle, behind, showing the near approach\r\nas I think to the nostril.\r\n\r\nThe palate half an inch broad, is divided into two concave channels by\r\nthe strong and sharp median ridge, which projects below the alveolar\r\nmargins. The dental margins are not rounded as in _C. microdon_, but\r\nflattened, making more than a right angle with both the outer side-wall\r\nand palate. The interspaces between the teeth are rough, looking as\r\nthough they had supported minute teeth. The alveolar margin is a\r\ntenth of an inch wide; along it are the perfectly circular sockets, a\r\nsixteenth of an inch in diameter. There are 3 sockets between 5/8 of an\r\ninch, so that they are separated by 3 times their diameter. The palate\r\nis obliquely impressed with blood-vessels running forward to the teeth\r\nfrom the median ridge.\r\n\r\nThe points in which this jaw differs from that of _O. microdon_ are\r\nthat in this species the teeth are circular instead of being oval; that\r\nthe interspaces here are as long as in that species, though this jaw\r\nis only two-thirds the width; that instead of having a sharp keel on\r\nthe upper surface, this has a well rounded roof. That though the jaw\r\nis scarcely higher than it is wide, it shows strong furrows running up\r\nto the nares, while in _O. microdon_, though the proportions are the\r\nsame, the sides are perfectly flat without trace of pinching in, while\r\nthe line of the nasal opening is indicated by a faint furrow running\r\nall along the jaw. And lastly it differs in size, which, where the\r\nsutures are lost, may be important in discriminating forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VI.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus microdon (Seeley).\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_    29      1-2\r\n\r\nPremaxillary bone. The fossil is nearly 1-3/4ths inch long, and at the\r\nproximal end, where it is less than 3/4ths of an inch high, has flat\r\nsides, which converge to form a keel which is depressed anteriorly\r\nand rounded so that where fractured in front the bone is 7/16ths of\r\nan inch deep. The palatal surface contains two wide concave channels,\r\nbetween which descends a sharp median ridge, which behind becomes more\r\nprominent than the alveolar border.\r\n\r\nThe palate is 5/8ths of an inch wide. The alveolar margins are\r\ncompressed and rounded. The small tooth-sockets are oval, and four are\r\ncontained in 1-1/8th inch; they look downward.\r\n\r\nThere is a small tip of a jaw associated with this fossil, which is so\r\nlike that it might be part of the bone broken off before fossilization.\r\nIt corresponds in every way except that the teeth are closer. In this\r\nterminal lanceolate fragment there are in 5/8ths of an inch four teeth.\r\nThe snout is terminated by two, which are close together.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VII.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus Huxleyi (Seeley).\r\n\r\nThe only specimen of this species yet known is the greater part of a\r\ndentary bone contained in the Museum of the Geological Survey. An inch\r\nand 1/4 long and 3/4ths of an inch wide, it is less than half an inch\r\ndeep: the sides slowly converge towards the front, and it appears to\r\nhave had an obtusely lanceolate beak. The under surface is convex, too\r\ninflated for trace of a keel, and tapers to the end of the beak, which,\r\nwith the left alveolar margin is abraded. The palatal surface is smooth\r\nat its front end, but two diverging ridges soon arise and form the\r\nboundary of a posteriorly deepening mesial channel, which is a quarter\r\nof an inch wide at the fracture. These ridges too, which are parallel\r\nwith the compressed and rounded alveolar margins, convert the lateral\r\nspaces into shallow channels. The right side shows the sockets of 3\r\nsmall oval teeth separated by interspaces wider than teeth. A tooth and\r\ntwo interspaces measure 7/16ths of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe only cretaceous Pterodactyle which this at all resembles is _O.\r\nmicrodon_, but the palate is wider than in that species; the sides\r\nconverge towards each other more rapidly, as though it belonged to a\r\nspecies with a shorter snout.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Prof. Huxley for the opportunity of making a notice of\r\nthis species.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VIII.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus oxyrhinus (Seeley).\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c2_   13       1\r\n\r\nThis well-marked species is a portion of a premaxillary bone 1-1/4 inch\r\nlong, fractured behind and in front. The palate is half an inch wide;\r\nits two halves are inclined to each other at a considerable angle, and\r\nwhere they meet form a more prominent keel. The tooth-sockets look more\r\noutward than downward, are nearly circular, separated by interspaces\r\nas long as the sockets; three sockets and two interspaces measure one\r\ninch. The jaw is about 5/8ths of an inch high in front, and about\r\n1/16th of an inch higher behind. The sides are flat and converge like\r\nthe sides of a wedge to a sharp rostral keel.\r\n\r\n\r\n  IX.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus xyphorhynchus (Seeley).\r\n\r\nI have seen but one example of this form. It has lost much of the outer\r\nlayer of bone, and shows on the sides impressions like tooth-marks from\r\nan eater of Pterodactyles. A groove which has some appearance of being\r\ndue to fracture traverses each side, but the specimen is symmetrical,\r\nand has its characters in no way changed by the accident.\r\n\r\nIt is a portion of a lower jaw of a long-beaked Pterodactyle of the\r\n_O. Sedgwicki_ type, with parallel sides, and the rounded basal ridge\r\nnearly parallel with the palate.\r\n\r\nThe fragment is two inches long, showing four large and obliquely set\r\nsockets in If inch. The tooth-sockets are on the outer two-thirds of\r\nthe palate, and looked forward, upward, and outward The interspaces\r\neach measure 5/16ths of an inch.\r\n\r\nEach half of the palatal surface which is 5/16 of an inch wide,\r\ninclines to the other half at a right angle, being parted by a narrow\r\ngroove; the diameter of the jaw is half an inch.\r\n\r\nThe depth of the jaw is 5/8ths of an inch in front, and 3/4ths of an\r\ninch behind. The sides are flat and approximate below to a sharp keel.\r\nThis species is one of many in the collection of W. Reed, Esq. of\r\nYork, kindly placed in my hands for the elucidation of those in the\r\nWoodwardian Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n  X.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus Fittoni (Owen).\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n    =J=  _c_    14      1, 2\r\n\r\nThe fragment is 1-1/2 inch long, with two large elliptical\r\ntooth-sockets on each side of the flattened palate, and one pair in\r\nfront. The third socket is separated from the fourth by a considerable\r\ninterspace. Between the third sockets arises the median palatal ridge,\r\nand from the inner margin of each socket a lateral ridge appears to be\r\ncontinued. Behind the third socket the jaw measures 11/16ths of an inch\r\nfrom side to side, and 10/16ths of an inch high. The sides converge\r\nand round convexly into each other. The jaws appear to have been long;\r\nIt is only known by upper jaws. The type specimen shows the socket of\r\nanother tooth in front of the last one figured by Prof. Owen. It is\r\ndirected outward at a greater angle, and separated from the hinder one\r\nby a wall not 1/16th of an inch thick, and the teeth of this pair must\r\nhave been parted from each other by a film equally thin. There is no\r\ntruncation of the snout as in _O. Woodwardi_.\r\n\r\nAnother specimen shows some variations. This fragment of a premaxillary\r\nbone is fractured through the third pair of tooth-sockets in front\r\nand through the seventh pair behind. It is about 2-1/8th inches\r\nlong; the palate is 11/16ths of an inch wide behind the great tooth,\r\nand maintains the same width. The jaw is 11/16ths of an inch high\r\nbehind, and 10/16ths high in front. The sides are gently convex, and\r\nimperceptibly unite to form the well-rounded depressed mesial ridge of\r\nthe beak. From the front of the third to the back of the fifth socket\r\nmeasures 1-3/8ths inch. The sockets are ovate, rather smaller, and\r\ncloser together than in the type of _O. Fittoni_; margins elevated.\r\nThe variations from types are so many, and often so considerable, as\r\nto suggest the idea that the fossil groups called species may in the\r\nliving animals have often been genera.\r\n\r\nIn all the specimens the end of the palate is a little reflected upward.\r\n\r\n\r\n  XI.\r\n\r\n  _Ornithocheirus dentatus_ (Seeley).\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Series. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c1_   9        1\r\n\r\nA fragment of premaxillary bone two inches long, fractured behind the\r\nsocket for the seventh tooth. It most nearly resembles _O. Sedgwicki_\r\nand _O. Cuvieri_. Behind the second tooth the palate is 1/2 an inch\r\nwide; behind the sixth socket it is 5/8ths of an inch wide; the\r\ndistance between these points is nearly 1-1/2 inch. The palate is\r\nflattened, with a sharp slight mesial keel and a wide concave channel\r\non each side which dies away in front. The first pair of teeth are in\r\nfront of the snout, rather small, and look forward. In this specimen\r\nthe large third tooth is not developed on the left side. The second and\r\nthird sockets are large and close together; the succeeding teeth are\r\nparted from each other by interspaces equal to their own diameter. They\r\nare gibbously elliptical. The sides of the jaw are gently convex from\r\nabove downward; they round into each other to form a narrow rostral\r\nkeel. Behind the second socket the jaw is 1/2 an inch high; behind the\r\nsixth it is nearly 7/8ths of an inch high.\r\n\r\nThe grooved and relatively wider palate, and the relatively smaller\r\nteeth, abundantly distinguish this species from _O. Sedgwicki_ (Owen).\r\n\r\nThe smaller, more circular teeth, placed closer together, distinguish\r\nit from _O.

The\r\nsides converge superiorly to form a well-rounded keel. The palate is\r\nflattened, with a slightly elevated blunt median keel. There appears to\r\nbe a pair of small teeth in front of the snout as usual, and six on the\r\npalate, with an indication of another at the posterior fracture. The\r\nteeth are of moderate size and almost circular.

The palate is flat, with the faintest\r\nmedian ridge, and the sides are flat and round into a narrow\r\nrostral keel, which in front approximates rapidly towards the\r\npalate. The first pair of sockets are missing; what appears to be\r\nthe second pair are about 1/8th of an inch long, separated from the\r\npair behind by an interspace of 1/4th of an inch. These are ovate\r\nand less than 1/4th of an inch long, and separated from the next\r\npair by an interspace of not less than 1/4th of an inch. The height\r\nof the jaw over the first pair of sockets preserved is 9/16ths of an\r\ninch; over the second pair it is 14/16ths of an inch; the space\r\nbetween these points is 9/16ths of an inch. Behind the second pair\r\nof teeth the palate is nearly 5/8ths of an inch wide.\r\n\r\nThe only species which it resembles is _O. brachyrhinus_, but\r\ndiffers from that in the flatter, narrower palate, which makes a\r\ngreater angle with the rostral keel, and in the smaller teeth,\r\nwhich are separated by wider interspaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n  XIV.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus nasutus (Seeley).\r\n\r\n  Case.

Cuvieri_ in the aspect of the palate, but the jaw\r\nis more elongated, and expands from side to side at the anterior\r\nend. The teeth are opposite to each other in front, but become\r\nirregular after the sixth. The palate measures behind the second\r\npair of sockets 3/4ths of an inch, behind the third pair it is a sixteenth\r\nof an inch wider, behind the ninth pair half an inch, and in the\r\nlast two inches it begins to widen again. A sharp keel arises\r\nbehind the second pair of sockets and becomes more prominent to\r\nbehind the tenth pair, when the channel which accompanies it on\r\neach side seems to disappear. The first pair of teeth, which look\r\nforward, is smaller than the second and third pairs; they are closer\r\ntogether than those which follow. The third sockets are 7/8ths of\r\nan inch from the tip of the snout. Then follow three smaller,\r\nmore circular teeth, which are separated from each other by interspaces\r\nas long as the sockets. The back of the sixth sockets are\r\n2-1/4 inches from the tip of the snout. Then follow two larger\r\nmore elliptical sockets; after which the sockets become smaller\r\nand are separated by longer distances, that between the 10th and\r\n11th pairs is nearly 3/4ths of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe height of the jaw behind the second pair of sockets is 5/8ths\r\nof an inch, behind the sixth sockets 15/16ths, behind the tenth sockets\r\n1-1/4 inch. In front, the nose has the aspect of being compressed\r\nfrom above downward, and behind it is compressed from side to\r\nside. The sides are flattened and round into a narrow rostral\r\nridge which is depressed at the anterior end.\r\n\r\n\r\n  XV.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus polyodon (Seeley),\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp.

It is 5/8ths of an inch wide; the\r\nlateral margins approximate very slowly, and in front it appears to be\r\ntruncated. It is an inch and a quarter long, and in that space were\r\non each side six large round teeth, almost as close together as they\r\ncould be, five on the palate and a pair in front. The terminal two\r\nare no wider apart than the rest, and point more forward. A moderate,\r\nsharp, median ridge descends in the flattened palate, making its\r\nlateral halves a little concave. The front termination of the palate is\r\nslightly reflected upward. The jaw, which is 1/2 an inch deep behind,\r\ntapers to its termination more rapidly than does _O. Fittoni_. The flat\r\nsides similarly converge, and form a well-rounded ridge, which does not\r\nget blunter in front. From their close approximation, it results that\r\nthe tooth-sockets are entirely above the palatal surface, so that they\r\nare better seen from the side of the jaw than from the palate.\r\n\r\nIt is a clearly marked species, as well distinguished from _O. Fittoni_\r\nby the closeness of its teeth, as _O. Sedgwicki_ is from _O. Cuvieri_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  XVI.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus denticulatus (Seeley).\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Series.

Comp. Tablet.\r\n   =J=   _c_    24\r\n\r\nThis fragment of a premaxillaiy bone is fractured behind the sockets\r\nfor the third pair of teeth. It is 1-1/8 inch long, and shows one pair\r\nof small teeth in front and two pairs of large ovate teeth on the\r\npalate. The first pair are divided from each other and from the second\r\npair by films of bone; and the second pair are separated from the\r\nthird by rather more than half the length, of the third socket. Behind\r\nthe third pair of sockets the palate is 5/8ths of an inch wide; it is\r\nflattened, and has a blunt moderately elevated mesial ridge. Behind\r\nthe second pair of sockets the jaw is 5/8ths of an inch high; behind\r\nthe third pair of sockets it is 3/4ths of an inch high; the distance\r\nbetween the places of measurement is 1/2 an inch. The sides are flat\r\nand converge to a rounded nose. The jaw is rounded from side to side\r\nin front, and the outline of the top of the nose rounds over the blunt\r\ntermination of the snout above the teeth on to the palate.\r\n\r\nIn the shortness of the nose it somewhat resembles the _?P. giganteus_\r\n(Bowerbank), but the jaw attenuates less rapidly, is truncated, and has\r\nlarger teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  XIX.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus enchorhynchus (Seeley).\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet.\r\n   =J=   _c_    25\r\n\r\nThis species nearly resembles _O. brachyrhinus,_ from which it differs\r\nin larger size, with a relatively wider palate, which is without a\r\nkeel, and in a larger front pair of teeth. It approximates towards\r\n_O, colorhinus_, but is smaller, and wants the rugose lunate area\r\nover the front pair of teeth characteristic of that species. There\r\nare many varieties or species nearly related to this type, but from\r\ntheir imperfect preservation and the small part of the head which they\r\nrepresent, it is not possible to give descriptions of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  XX.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus eurygnathus (Seeley).\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Series. Tablet.\r\n   =J=   _c3_   16      1\r\n\r\nA fragment of a ?dentary bone, fractured behind through the socket for\r\nthe third tooth. The sockets are nearly circular. It measures about an\r\ninch long,, and behind the socket for the second tooth 1-3/4 inch high.\r\nThe sides of the jaw are gently concave from above downward, having\r\na pinched aspect and approximating; they round into a narrow rostral\r\nridge, which widens towards the tip of the snout and is truncated by\r\na small sub-circular [or sub-pentagonal] rugose area at right angles\r\nwith the part of the palate behind the first pair of sockets. The first\r\npair of sockets are nearly as large as the second, and from the steep\r\nincline of the jaw look more than usually upward; they are 7/16ths of\r\nan inch long, are separated from each other by an interspace of 6/16\r\nths, and from the second sockets by an interspace of more than 1/8th of\r\nan inch, while the second socket is separated from the third by about\r\n1/4th of an inch. The palatal space between the second pair is about\r\n3/4ths of an inch.\r\n\r\n\r\n  XXI.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus colorhinus (Seeley).\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_    17      1, 2\r\n\r\nFragments of premaxillary bones. The largest portion is 2-1/2 inches\r\nlong, and is fractured behind the socket for the fourth tooth, and the\r\nupper part of the nose is also broken away. The palate is flattened,\r\nwith the median part slightly convex. The sides of the jaw converge\r\nupward, but not rapidly; in front they round into each other, but there\r\nis a slight mesial depression. The front pair of teeth are large,\r\nseparated from each other and from the second pair by films of bone.\r\nAbove the first pair of sockets, so as to look downward and forward, is\r\nan impressed lunate area 9/16ths of an inch wide and 5/16ths of an inch\r\nhigh, to which a soft lip may have been attached. This area is in the\r\nsame plane with the first pair of teeth and at right angles with the\r\nupper outline of the nose. The sockets of the first pair of teeth are a\r\nlittle smaller than the second pair; they are both about half an inch\r\nin diameter and nearly circular. An interspace of 3/16ths of an inch\r\nseparates the second socket from the third. The tooth is elliptical,\r\nthe socket being narrower and longer than that of the second. The\r\npalatal interspace between the third pair is more than 3/4ths of an\r\ninch. The interspace between the third and fourth sockets is about\r\n3/8ths of an inch. The diameter of the nearly circular fourth socket is\r\n1/4th of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe overhanging lunate lip space, with the size of the teeth and width\r\nof the palate, abundantly distinguish this species.\r\n\r\n\r\n  XXII.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus woodwardi (Owen).\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Tablet. Specimen.\r\n   =J=   _c_    18      1-4\r\n\r\nI regard the fragment on which this species was founded as being the\r\nterminal end, and not a section of a jaw; partly from the rounding of\r\nthe lateral surfaces to the front, and chiefly from the snapped off\r\nteeth in the middle of the truncated anterior end, for they are smaller\r\nthan the pair behind them, and look forward at a greater angle, so that\r\nthe converging sockets of both pairs meet behind. These characters are\r\nwell shown in Mr Dinkel's excellent figure, Pl. II. fig. 3_a_. Second\r\nSup. Palæont. The palate is destroyed, and gives no clue to the bone\r\nbeing either lower or upper.\r\n\r\nAnother specimen, rather smaller, shows the rostrum well rounded; the\r\nfront is truncated at right angles to it: there is the same rounding\r\nof its lower part into the sides, and the stumps of the front pair of\r\nteeth are visible though they are again worn level with the rugose\r\nfront of the snout.\r\n\r\nBut the finest fragment of this species is a rostral end, (perhaps of\r\nthe upper jaw) three inches long, two inches deep, and with the palate\r\nas wide. It indicates 5 teeth on a side: the front pair small, 2nd and\r\n3rd much larger, and two pairs behind, which are smaller. The palate\r\nis flat, and attains its greatest width at the third tooth, behind\r\nwhich it contracts noticeably. The third tooth is more than half an\r\ninch in diameter, the fourth is 5/16ths of an inch long. The spaces\r\nbetween teeth seem equal to the long diameter of the sockets, which\r\nare oval and straight. The sides round into the front of the muzzle\r\nmore gradually in this specimen than in the others. An impressed line\r\nruns along the median ridge of the upper surface. Just as the jaw gets\r\nnarrower behind, so the well-rounded upper surface becomes more acute\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nBehind the third socket the palate measures 1-7/8 inch from side to\r\nside, and the jaw is there nearly 2 inches high.\r\n\r\nThis is the most massive Pterodactyle jaw known. In the recent state\r\nit may have indicated a creature sufficiently distinguished from\r\nthose to which the smaller fossils belonged, but now the divergence of\r\ncharacters is so slight as to be for zoological purposes of no value.\r\n\r\nIt is related to O. Fittoni; the chief points of difference being the\r\ntruncated muzzle, the compression behind the third tooth, the much\r\nsharper (?) dorsal ridge, and the large size of the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n  XXIII.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus capito (Seeley).\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Series. Tablet.\r\n   =J=   _c3_   14      1\r\n\r\nA fragment of premaxillary bone, well distinguished from every other\r\nspecimen, except one in the collection of Mr Reed of York, which is\r\nhere named _O. Reedi_. It is a large head, with larger teeth than any\r\nknown species. The jaw is truncated in front, with a rugose vertical\r\narea in front reaching 1-3/4 inch high from the palate, on which the\r\nusual front pair of teeth are not seen. At the angle of this front area\r\nwith the palate is a large elliptical tooth 9/16ths of an inch wide,\r\nand behind it, with an interspace of 3/16ths of an inch, is a socket\r\nmeasuring 10/16ths of an inch in length; the next interspace is about\r\n1/8th of an inch, and the next nearly circular socket is 5/16ths long;\r\nthen another interspace of 1/8th of an inch, and another and a smaller\r\ntooth. The palate appears to have been channelled. The sides of the\r\njaw are flat, or slightly concave, and where fractured above, are 3\r\ninches high. Above the rugose vertical area of the snout, is an area,\r\nconcave from back to front, reaching up to the rostral keel; it is flat\r\nfrom side to side behind, and convex from side to side in front. So\r\nmuch as is preserved measures 1-3/4 inch in length, and appears to be\r\nrelatively narrower than in O. Reedi.\r\n\r\n\r\n  XXIV.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus Reedi (Seeley).\r\n\r\nThe anterior part of an upper jaw has flattened slightly concave sides,\r\nwhich converge above so as to form boundaries of (1) a flat triangular\r\narea which looks anteriorly, and of (2) an oblong area, traversed by\r\na mesial groove, which looks upward and forward and is concave from\r\nback to front. In the lower half of the truncated triangular anterior\r\ntermination are the remains of the stumps of the two anterior teeth;\r\nthey are oval in outline, 9/16ths of an inch high, and 7/16ths of an\r\ninch wide; they are parted by an interspace nearly 1/4 of an inch\r\nwide, which becomes concave vertically as it rounds on to the palatal\r\nsurface. All the front triangular surface above the teeth is rough: its\r\nentire height is about 1-1/4 inch, and is nearly as wide across the\r\nbase. The side rounds a little into the concave median upper surface,\r\nand into the triangular front; so much as is preserved measures 2-1/2\r\ninches high, and 1-3/8 inch long. The palatal surface, which is very\r\nsmall and badly preserved, is 1-3/4 inch wide behind, but gives no\r\nindication of further widening. On its outer border are seen two large\r\ncircular teeth 5/8ths of an inch in diameter; they are separated by a\r\nmedian palatal interspace of 7/8ths of an inch. Where it is fractured\r\nbehind, the specimen shows the sockets of another pair of teeth behind\r\nthese, with an interspace of 1/4 of an inch in the antero-posterior\r\ndirection. The palate is convex.\r\n\r\nThe superior oblong area is concave in length as well as transversely.\r\nIt makes a great angle with the triangular front of which it is the\r\nupward continuation; so much as is preserved extends 1-1/2 inch in\r\nlength; it is about 1/2 an inch wide.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to W. Reed, Esq. of York, for the opportunity of making a\r\nnotice of this species, which closely resembles _O. capito_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The species which follow were separated in the \"Index to the\r\n  Ornithosauria,\" &c. as a different genus. That proposal might\r\n  still be sustained, for these massive truncated jaws are unlike\r\n  the spear-shaped jaws of many of the species. And to the minds of\r\n  some readers the forms already described will arrange themselves in\r\n  groups which not improbably indicate genera. But a re-examination of\r\n  the type _Pterodactylus simus_ (Owen) has convinced me that it is a\r\n  _lower jaw_, and therefore it affords no evidence of the presence or\r\n  absence of the peculiar front premaxillary teeth which characterize\r\n  nearly all the Cretaceous species.\r\n\r\n\r\n  XXV.\r\n\r\n  Ornithocheirus simus (Owen).\r\n\r\n  Case. Comp. Specimen.\r\n    =J=  _c_  16\r\n\r\nThe palate is 2-3/4 inches long, and at the second pair of teeth\r\nabout 7/8ths of an inch wide. It is fractured at the end through\r\nthe fifth socket, and at the side along the palatal groove. The\r\nfirst pair of teeth is smaller and closer together than the others.\r\nThe palatal interspace between the second pair is 3/8ths of an inch;\r\nbetween the third pair, which are large teeth, it is 1/2 an inch.\r\nThe sockets are sub-circular, and are not separated from each\r\nother by wider interspaces than their own length. In front is a\r\nlong triangular rugose area, convex from above downward, a distance\r\nof 1-1/2 inch; and concave from side to side, a width above of\r\nrather more than 1/2 an inch. Below this the flattened sides converge\r\nto a blunt keel; where, fractured, the jaw is 2-1/2 inches deep.\r\nThere are several fragments of species allied to the last; one\r\nhas the triangular area in front very small, only half as high as\r\nin the type and very narrow, for the sides are gently rounded\r\ninto it. It is marked by short longitudinal furrows, impressed\r\nvessels I think, while in O. simus the surface is irregularly rough.\r\nThe first pair of teeth are much larger than in O. simus; they\r\nare longer, more conical, and circular, and separated by as wide a\r\nspace as the second pair. There is not much to found a species on,\r\nbut as it appears to be quite distinct from O. simus, it is named\r\n_O. Carteri_. Another fragment, with the area very long, is marked\r\n_O. platyrhinus_. But a sufficiency of species has been indicated to\r\nmake known the Ornithosaurian fauna of the Cambridge Greensand.\r\nAnd the detailed description of critical types and of the\r\nother parts of the skeletons is beyond the general osteology of the\r\ntribe, and will rather belong to a memoir in which this flock of\r\nPterodactyles will be restored to their living forms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  A fragment of the lower jaw of a large Ornithocheirus has been\r\n  obtained from an outlier of the Upper Greensand at Rocken End in\r\n  the Isle of Wight. It appears to indicate a distinct species. It is\r\n  2-1/2 inches long, and shows three large teeth still preserved in\r\n  their sockets. The extreme width outside the third pair of sockets\r\n  is nearly 2 inches. The sides, which are slightly concave from above\r\n  downward, converge so as to give the broken end a triangular outline.\r\n  In front is a small sub-triangular area, deeply scored with vascular\r\n  markings; below this the outline slopes obliquely backward, and the\r\n  two sides there round convexly into each other. The first socket is\r\n  7/16ths of an inch long, the tooth coarsely striated, and like the\r\n  others elliptical; the interspace between the first and the second\r\n  teeth is 5/16ths of an inch. The second tooth, probably immature, is\r\n  an inch in length, smooth, and like the third traversed in front and\r\n  behind by a slight lateral ridge; at the base it measures 5/16ths\r\n  of an inch from front to back. The third tooth is rather less than\r\n  5/8ths of an inch from front to back. The interspace between the\r\n  first and second _sockets_, which the teeth do not entirely fill,\r\n  is more than 1/4 of an inch. The posterior margin of each socket is\r\n  elevated into a sort of collar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n  _Enumeration of some of the principal writings on the Ornithosauria\r\n    (selected chiefly from Von Meyer's Reptilien aus dem\r\n    Lithographischen Schiefer), with references to the shelves in the\r\n    Cambridge University Library, where the books may be consulted._\r\n\r\n  Agassiz (Louis).--Memoires Soc.
