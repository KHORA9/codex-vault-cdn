She was opposite the California shore, only a day's sail\r\ndistant from the City of the Golden Gate, and many of the passengers had\r\nalready begun making preparations for landing, even though a whole night\r\nand the better part of a day was to intervene ere they could expect to\r\nset their feet upon solid land.\r\n\r\nShe was one of those magnificent steamers that ply regularly between\r\nPanama and California. She had rather more than her full cargo of\r\nfreight and passengers; but, among the hundreds of the latter, we have\r\nto do with but three.\r\n\r\nOn this moonlight night, there were gathered by themselves these three\r\npersonages, consisting of Tim O'Rooney, Elwood Brandon and Howard\r\nLawrence. The first was a burly, good-natured Irishman, and the two\r\nlatter were cousins, their ages differing by less than a month, and both\r\nbeing in their sixteenth year.\r\n\r\nThe financial storm that swept over the country in 18--, toppling down\r\nmerchants and banking-houses like so many ten-pins, carried with it in\r\nthe general wreck and ruin, that of Brandon, Herman & Co., and the\r\nsenior partner, Sylvanus Brandon, returned to his home in Brooklyn, New\r\nYork, one evening worse than penniless. While he was meditating,\r\ndejected and gloomy, as to the means by which he was to keep the wolf\r\nfrom the door, his clerk brought him a letter which had been overlooked\r\nin the afternoon's mail, postmarked, \"San Francisco, Cal.\" At once he\r\nrecognized the bold, handsome superscription as that of his kind-hearted\r\nbrother-in-law, Thomas Lawrence. His heart beat with a strong hope as he\r\nbroke the envelope, and his eyes glistened ere he had read one-half.\r\n\r\nIn short, it stated that Mr. Lawrence had established himself\r\nsuccessfully in business, and was doing so well that he felt the\r\nimperative need of a partner, and ended by urging Mr. Brandon to accept\r\nthe position. The bankrupt merchant laid the epistle in his lap, removed\r\nhis spectacles and looked smilingly toward his wife. They held a long\r\ndiscussion, and both decided to accept the offer at once, as there was\r\nno other recourse left to them.\r\n\r\nIt was evident from the letter that Mr. Lawrence had some apprehensions\r\nregarding Mr. Brandon's ability to weather the storm, but he could not\r\nbe aware of his financial crash, as it had only become known on the\r\nstreet within the last twenty-four hours. Mr. Brandon deemed it proper,\r\ntherefore, before closing with the offer, to acquaint his brother-in-law\r\nwith his circumstances, that he might fully understand the disadvantage\r\nunder which he would be placed by the new partnership.\r\n\r\nThe letter was written and duly posted, and our friends rather anxiously\r\nawaited the answer. It came in the gratifying form of a draft for $1,000\r\nto defray \"his necessary expenses,\" and an urgent entreaty to start\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nThe advice was acted upon, and within two weeks of the reception of the\r\nsecond letter, Mr. Brandon and his wife were on board the steamer at New\r\nYork, with their state-rooms engaged for California. They had but one\r\nchild, Elwood, whom they had placed at a private school where he was to\r\nprepare himself for college, in company with his cousin, Howard\r\nLawrence, who had been sent from California by his father and had\r\nentered the school at the same time.\r\n\r\nMr. Brandon learned that Mr. Lawrence was a brother indeed. The position\r\nin which the two men were placed proved so favorable to the former that\r\nin a few years he found himself almost as wealthy as in his palmiest\r\ndays, when his name was such a power in Wall Street. He had come to like\r\nthe young and growing State of California, and ere he had been there two\r\nyears both himself and wife had lost all longings for the metropolis of\r\nthe New World.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Elwood and Howard were doing well at their studies in\r\nBrooklyn. They had been inseparable friends from infancy, and as their\r\nyears increased the bonds of affection seemed to strengthen between\r\nthem. They were the only children of twin sisters, and bore a remarkable\r\nresemblance in person, character and disposition. Both had dark,\r\ncurling, chestnut hair, hazel eyes, and an active muscular organization\r\nthat made them leaders in boyish pastimes and sports. If there was any\r\nperceptible difference between the two, it was that Elwood Brandon was a\r\nlittle more daring and impetuous than his companion; he was apt to\r\nfollow out his first impulses and venture upon schemes without\r\ndeliberating fully enough. Both were generous, unselfish, and either\r\nwould have willingly risked his life for the other.\r\n\r\nThus matters stood until the summer when our young heroes had completed\r\ntheir preparatory course, and were ready to enter college. It was\r\ndecided by their parents that this should be done in the autumn, and\r\nthat the summer of this year should be spent by the boys with their\r\nparents in California. They had been separated from them for five years,\r\nduring which they had met but once, when the parents made a journey to\r\nNew York for that purpose, spending several months with them. That\r\nvisit, it may be said, was now to be returned, and the boys meant that\r\nit should be returned with interest.\r\n\r\nAnd so Tim O'Rooney, a good-natured, trustworthy Irishman, who had been\r\nin the employ of Mr. Lawrence for eight years, almost ever since his\r\narrival in America, was sent to New York to accompany the boys on their\r\nvisit home.\r\n\r\nHoward and Elwood were standing one afternoon on the corner of Montague\r\nStreet, in Brooklyn, chatting with each other about their expected trip\r\nto California. They had closed their school studies a week before, and\r\nboy-like were now anxious to be off upon their journey. Suddenly an\r\nIrishman came in sight, smoking furiously at a short black pipe. The\r\nfirst glance showed them that it was no other than Tim O'Rooney, the\r\nexpected messenger.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that good?\" exclaimed Elwood, \"the steamer sails on Saturday, and\r\nwe'll go in it. Here he comes, as though he was in a great hurry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say anything, and see whether he will know us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know we've grown a good deal since he was here, and the beard is\r\ngetting so stiff on my chin that it scratches my hand every time I touch\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; that mustache, too, is making you look as fierce as a Bluebeard;\r\nbut here he is!\"\r\n\r\nAt this instant Tim O'Rooney came opposite them. He merely glanced up,\r\npuffed harder than ever and was passing on, when both burst out in a\r\nloud laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Be the powers! what's the mather with ye spalpeens?\" he angrily\r\ndemanded. \"Can't a dacent man be passing the sthrats widout being\r\ninsulted----Howly mother! is it yerselves or is it your grandfathers?\"\r\n\r\nHe had recognized them, and a hearty hand-shaking followed. Tim grinned\r\na great deal over his mistake, and answered their questions in his dry,\r\nwitty way, and assured them that his instructions were to bring them\r\nhome as soon as possible. Accordingly, they embarked on the steamer on\r\nthe following Saturday; and, passing over the unimportant incidents of\r\ntheir voyage, we come back to our starting point, where all three were\r\nwithin a day's journey of their destination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow we shall be home,\" said Elwood Brandon, addressing his\r\ncompanion, although at the time he was looking out on the moon-lit sea,\r\nin the direction of California.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; if nothing unexpected happens,\" replied his cousin, who was\r\npushing and drawing a large Newfoundland dog that lay at his feet.\r\n\r\n\"And what can happen?\" asked his cousin, turning abruptly toward him.\r\n\r\n\"A hundred things. Suppose the boiler should blow up, we run on a rock,\r\ntake fire, or get struck by a squall----\"\r\n\r\n\"Or be carried away in a balloon,\" was the impatient exclamation. \"One\r\nis just as likely to happen as the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly--heigh-ho!\"\r\n\r\nHoward at that moment had twined his feet around the neck of Terror, the\r\nNewfoundland, and the mischievous dog, springing suddenly to his feet,\r\nbrought his master from his seat to the deck, which, as a matter of\r\ncourse, made both of the cousins laugh.\r\n\r\n\"He did that on purpose,\" said Howard, recovering his position.\r\n\r\n\"Of course he did. You have been pestering him for the last half-hour,\r\nand he is getting tired of it; but I may say, Howard, I shall hardly be\r\nable to sleep to-night, I am so anxious to see father and mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I; a few years makes such a difference in us, while I can't\r\ndetect the least change in them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except a few more gray hairs, or perhaps an additional wrinkle or two.\r\nWhat's the matter with Tim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tim! O nothing, he seems to be meditating and smoking. Fact is that is\r\nabout all he has done since he has been with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's been a grand time for Tim, and I have no doubt he has enjoyed the\r\ntrip to and from California as much as either of us.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject of these remarks was seated a few feet away, his arms\r\nfolded, while he was looking with a vague, dreamy expression out upon\r\nthe great Pacific, stretching so many thousand miles beyond them,\r\nrolling far off in each direction, until sky and ocean blended in great\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe he is looking for Asia,\" laughed Elwood in an undertone.\r\n\r\n\"More likely he is hoping to get a glimpse of Ireland, for he would be\r\nas likely to look in that direction as any other. I say, Tim!\"\r\n\r\nThe Irishman did not heed the call until he was addressed the second\r\ntime in a louder tone than before, when he suddenly raised his head.\r\n\r\n\"Whisht! what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you thinking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothin', I was dreaming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dreaming! what about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Begorrah but that was a qua'r dream, was that same one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's hear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's onplaiasnt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, out with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, thin, if I must tell yees, I was thinking that this owld staamer\r\nwas all on fire, and all of us passengers was jumping around in the\r\nwather, pulling each other down, away miles into the sea, till we was\r\ngone so long there wasn't a chance iver to git up agin.\"\r\n\r\nA strange fear thrilled both of the boys at the mention of this, and\r\nthey looked at each other a moment in silence.\r\n\r\n\"What put that into your head, Tim?\"\r\n\r\n\"And it's just the question I was axing meself, for I never draamed of\r\nsuch a thing in my life before, and it's mighty qua'r that I should take\r\na notion to do it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"It ain't worth talking about,\" said Elwood, showing an anxiety to\r\nchange the subject.\r\n\r\n\"Be yees going to bed to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't feel a bit sleepy,\" replied Elwood. \"I'd just as soon sit up\r\nhalf the night as not.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so would I; it must be after eleven o'clock, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's near 'levin,\" replied Tim. \"I'm not able to examine me watch; and\r\nif I was, I couldn't tell very well, as it hasn't run for a few months.\"\r\n\r\nHoward took out his watch, but the moonlight was too faint for him to\r\ndistinguish the hands, and the three were content to let the precise\r\ntime remain a matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\n\"Tim, how close are we to land?\" asked Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"I should say about the same distance that the land is from us, and\r\nbegorrah that's the best information I can give yees.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could see the mountains very plainly when the sun was setting,\" said\r\nHoward, \"and it cannot be many miles away.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of a country is it off here?\" pursued Elwood, pointing in the\r\ndirection of the land.\r\n\r\n\"It is wild and rocky, and there are plenty of Indians and wild animals\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\" asked Elwood, in some amazement.\r\n\r\n\"I have taken the trouble to learn all about California that I could\r\nbefore coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe they have _gold_ there?\" said Elwood, in rather a bantering\r\nvein.\r\n\r\n\"Tim can tell you more about that than I can, as he came to California\r\nto hunt gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is that, Tim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Begorrah, but he shpakes the truth. I wint up among the mountains to\r\nhunt gowld.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what luck had you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Luck, is it?\" repeated the Irishman, with an expression of ludicrous\r\ndisgust. \"Luck, does ye call it, to have your head cracked and your\r\nshins smashed by the copper-skins, chawed up by the b'ars, froze to\r\ndeath in the mountains, drowned in the rivers--that run into the top of\r\nyer shanty when yer sound asleep--your feet gnawed off by wolverines, as\r\nthey call--and--but whisht! don't talk to me of luck, and all the time\r\nye never gets a sight of a particle of gowld.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys laughed, Howard said:\r\n\r\n\"But your luck is not every one's, Tim; there have been plenty who have\r\nmade fortunes at the business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, but they wasn't Tim O'Rooneys. He's not the man that was born to\r\nbe rich!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're better satisfied where you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, thank God, that I've such a good home, and an ongrateful dog would\r\nI baa if I should ask more.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Elwood, it's getting late, and this night air begins to feel\r\nchilly. It can't be far from midnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am willing; where's Terror? Ah! here he is; old fellow, come along\r\nand keep faithful watch over your friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boys,\" said Tim O'Rooney, with a strange, husky intonation, \"you\r\nremember my dream about this steamer burning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; what of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is coming thrue!\"\r\n\r\n_He spoke the truth!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAFLOAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Tim O'Rooney spoke, he pointed to the bow of the steamer, where, in\r\nthe bright moonlight, some smoke could be seen rising--where, too, the\r\nnext instant, they caught sight of a gleam of fire.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, heaven! what shall we do?\" exclaimed Elwood, struck with a panic.\r\n\r\n\"Wait and trust to Providence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us jump overboard; I'd rather be drowned than burned to death.\r\nCome, Howard, let's jump over this minute!\"\r\n\r\nHe made a move toward the stern of the steamer, near which they had been\r\nseated, as if he intended to spring overboard, when his arm was sternly\r\ncaught by the Irishman, who said in an indignant tone:\r\n\r\n\"Kaap cool! kaap cool! don't make a fool of yoursilf. Can ye swim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Howard, \"we can both swim very well. Can you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indaad, I can--swim like a stone.\"\r\n\r\n\"But good heavens!\" exclaimed Elwood, who had not entirely recovered\r\nfrom his excitement, \"the land is miles off, and we can't swim there,\r\nnot taking into account the heavy sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\"\r\n\r\nAs Howard spoke, the bow of the steamer made a sweeping bend to the\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\"They've headed toward shore,\" said Elwood.\r\n\r\nThis snatch of conversation had occupied the shortest possible space of\r\ntime. The fire had been discovered by the officials on board fully as\r\nsoon as by our friends, and the men could be seen running hurriedly to\r\nand fro, all quiet and still, for they knew too well what the result\r\nwould be if the alarm was communicated to the sleeping passengers. The\r\npilot had headed the vast craft toward land, and by the furious\r\nthrobbing of the engines it could be seen that the doomed vessel was\r\nstraining to the utmost, like some affrighted, faithful horse striving\r\nto carry his master as nearly as possible to the port of safely ere he\r\ndropped down and died.\r\n\r\nIt was fully midnight, and, as a matter of course, very nearly all the\r\npassengers were in their berths. There were a few, however, who were\r\nlingering on the promenade deck, some smoking--here and there a couple\r\nof lovers all unconscious of everything else--one or two avaricious\r\nspeculators; and but a few minutes could elapse before the startling\r\ndanger should become known.\r\n\r\nThe last words, which we have given as spoken by our friends, had\r\nscarcely been said, when a man, who apparently had been stretched out\r\nsound asleep, suddenly sprung up, wild with terror. \"The boat is on\r\nfire! _fire! fire_!\"\r\n\r\nHe darted hither and thither like some wild animal compassed on every\r\nhand by death, and then suddenly made a leap overboard, and was\r\nswallowed up in the sea.\r\n\r\nThe alarm spread with fearful rapidity, and was soon ringing through\r\nevery part of the steamer, and now began that fearful confusion and\r\npanic which no pen can clearly picture, and which, once seen, can never\r\nbe forgotten to the dying day.\r\n\r\nOur three friends were gathered at the stern of the steamer, earnestly\r\nand anxiously discussing the best course to pursue.\r\n\r\n\"Let's stay here,\" said Howard, \"for every second is taking us nearer\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what nearly all will do,\" said Elwood, \"but we can never reach\r\nthe shore, and when the time comes we shall all be in the sea together,\r\nstruggling and sinking, and we shall then be sure to go down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yez are right,\" said Tim, addressing the last speaker. \"Our only chance\r\nis to jump overboard this very minute, before the sea is full of the\r\npoor fellows. They'll begin to go over the ship's side and will kaap it\r\nup until the thing is burned up.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's time then that we hunted our life-preservers,\" said Howard.\r\n\r\n\"Git out wid yer life-presarvers!\" impatiently exclaimed Tim. \"Didn't me\r\nuncle wear one of 'em for six months, and then die with the faver! I'll\r\nheave over one of these settaas, and that'll kaap up afloat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be quick about it, Tim,\" urged Elwood, who was beginning to get\r\nnervous. \"See, the fire is spreading, and everybody seems to have found\r\nout what the matter is.\"\r\n\r\nThere was indeed no time to be lost. The steamer was doomed beyond all\r\npossibility of salvation, and must soon become unmanageable, when\r\neverything would be turned into a pandemonium. One of the large settees\r\nwas wrenched loose and lifted over the stern of the steamer.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Tim, \"the minute it goes over yez must follow. The owld\r\nstaamer is going like a straak of lightning, and if aither of yez wait,\r\nhe'll be lift behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, no danger, go ahead!\"\r\n\r\nThey now clambered up, and sat poised on the stern. In this fearful\r\nposition Tim O'Rooney held the settee balanced for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Be yez riddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do yez jump a little to the right, Elwood, and yez a little to the\r\nleft, Howard, so as not to hit the owld thing. All riddy; here we go!\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment the three were spinning down through the air, and struck\r\nthe water. They went below the surface, the boys sinking quite a\r\ndistance; but almost instantly they arose and struck bravely out.\r\n\r\n\"Tim, where are you?\" called out Elwood, not seeing his friend.\r\n\r\n\"Here, to the left,\" responded the Irishman, as he rose on a huge swell.\r\n\"Can ye swim to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, but my clothes bother me like creation.\"\r\n\r\nStrange! that not one of the three had once thought of removing their\r\nsuperfluous clothing before jumping into the ocean. But Elwood was a\r\nfine swimmer, and he struggled bravely, although at a great\r\ndisadvantage, until his outstretched hand was seized by the Irishman,\r\nand he then caught hold of the settee and rested himself.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Howard?\" he asked, panting from his exertions.\r\n\r\n\"Here he is,\" responded Howard himself. \"I struck the water so close\r\nthat when I came up my hand hit the settee.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what it is,\" said Elwood. \"We ought to have brought\r\nsomething else with us beside this. We have got to keep all of our\r\nbodies underwater for this to bear us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose some poor fellow claims a part. Gracious! here comes a man this\r\nminute!\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't turn him off,\" said Tim, \"but this owld horse has all the\r\ngrist he can carry.\"\r\n\r\nA dark body could be seen struggling and rapidly approaching them.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever he is, he is a good swimmer,\" remarked Howard, watching the\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\n\"Of course he is, for it comes natural; don't you see it isn't a man,\r\nbut old Terror.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank heaven for that! we never thought about him. I am glad he is with\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment the Newfoundland placed his paw on the settee and gave a\r\nlow bark to announce his joy at being among his friends. The sagacious\r\nbrute seemed to understand how frail the tenure was that held them all\r\nsuspended over eternity; for he did nothing more than rest the top of\r\nhis paw on the precious raft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA PASSENGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time our friends were a quarter of a mile in the rear of the\r\nburning steamer. The furious pulsations of the engines had stopped, and\r\nfrom stern to stern the great ship was one mass of soothing flame. The\r\nlight threw a glare upon the clouds above, and made it so bright where\r\nour friends were floating in the water that they could have read the\r\npages of a printed book. The illumination must have been seen for many\r\nand many a mile in every direction upon the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the steamer has stopped,\" said Howard; \"the fire has reached the\r\nengines, and now they must do as we have done.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they have boats and may escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not half enough of them; and then what they have got will be seized by\r\nthe crew, as they always do at such times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look! you can see them jumping over. The poor wretches hang fast till\r\nthey are so scorched that they have to let go.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's mighty lucky yees are here,\" said Tim, \"for every mother's son\r\nthat can swim will be hugged by a half-dozen that can't, which would be\r\nbad for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so; can't you swim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And nothing but this bench to keep us from sinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"And be the same towken isn't that good enough, if it only kaaps us\r\nafloat? Can't ye be satisfied?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look! how grand!\"\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a fearful sight, the steamer being one pyramid of roaring,\r\nblazing fire, sweeping upward in great fan-like rifts, then blowing\r\noutward, horizontally across the deep, as if greedy for the poor beings\r\nwho had sprung in agony from its embrace. Millions of sparks were\r\nfloating and drifting overhead and falling all around. The shrieks of\r\nthe despairing passengers, as with their clothes all aflame they sprung\r\nblindly into the ocean, could be heard by our friends, and must indeed\r\nhave extended a far greater distance.\r\n\r\nFor an hour the conflagration raged with apparently unabated violence,\r\nthe wreck drifting quite rapidly; but the fire soon tired of its work,\r\nlarge pieces of burning timber could be seen floating in the water, and\r\nfinally the charred hull made a plunge downward into the sea, and our\r\nfriends were left alone upon their frail support.\r\n\r\n\"Now, it's time to decide what we are going to do,\" said Howard.\r\n\r\n\"You are right, and what shall it be? Shall we drift about here until\r\nmorning, when some vessel will pick us up? I have no doubt this fire has\r\ndrawn a half-dozen toward it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; let's make for shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the best plan,\" said Tim.\r\n\r\n\"But it is a good way off,\" remarked Howard; \"and I have little hope of\r\nreaching it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind; it, will keep us busy, and that will make the time pass\r\nfaster than if we do nothing but float.\"\r\n\r\n\"We may need our strength; but it is the best plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do we know the direction?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can tell you that,\" said Elwood; \"for the moon was directly over the\r\nshore; so all we've got to do is to aim for the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Begorrah! we can walk and talk, as the owld lady said when her husband\r\nstopped on the way to the gallows to bid her good-by. So paddle away!\"\r\n\r\nIt being a warm summer night, the water was quite pleasant, although our\r\nfriends were sure to get enough of it long before they could hope to\r\nplace their feet upon the earth. Having now an object, they began\r\nworking with a will, the boys swimming as lustily as possible straight\r\nfor the shore, while Tim assisted materially in pushing forward the\r\ncraft.\r\n\r\nThe intelligent Newfoundland appeared to comprehend what was wanted, and\r\ncontributed not a little to the momentum.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think we are making any progress----\"\r\n\r\n\"O, save me! save me! I'm drowning!\"\r\n\r\nThe voice sounded close by them, and caused an involuntary start from\r\nall three.\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\" asked Howard, in a terrified whisper.\r\n\r\n\"There!\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment they caught sight of a man fiercely buffeting the waves,\r\nas he rose on an immense swell, and then sunk down again in the trough\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Can we do anything for him?\" asked Elwood. \"It's too bad to see the\r\npoor fellow sink when we may save him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afeared the owld bench won't bear another hand on it.\"\r\n\r\nBut Terror had heard that cry and anticipated the wishes of his friends.\r\nLeaving them with their raft, he struck powerfully out toward the\r\ndrowning man, and they both went down in the vast sea chasm together.\r\nWhen they came in view again upon the crest of the swell, the\r\nNewfoundland had the hair of the man's head in his teeth and had begun\r\nhis return. A moment later the gasping man threw out his hands and\r\ncaught the settee with such eagerness that it instantly sunk.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful!\" admonished Howard, \"or you'll drown us all. One of us\r\ncan't swim!\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't your raft bear us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if you keep only your head above water and bear very lightly upon\r\nit. Don't attempt to rise up.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right!\"\r\n\r\nThe buoyant raft came to the surface, and was instantly grasped firmly\r\nbut carefully by all. Poor Tim O'Rooney had come very near drowning. A\r\nman when suddenly cast into the water for the first time has been known\r\nto swim long and well; and the Irishman, by the most furious effort, had\r\nsaved himself from strangling and sinking, although he had swallowed a\r\ngood deal of the nauseating sea-water, and was now ejecting it.\r\n\r\n\"Worrah! I took an overdose that time, and it wouldn't sthay on my\r\nstomach!\" he said. \"I'm thinking there'll be no necessity of me\r\nswallowing any salts for some time to coom, be the towken that I've\r\nenough to last me me life-time.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are all right now!\" said the stranger. \"I can swim, but I was just\r\nabout used up when your dog took me in tow. May I inquire who my friends\r\nare?\"\r\n\r\nHoward gave their names and destination, and he instantly said:\r\n\r\n\"My name is Manuel Yard, and my place of business is next door to that\r\nof your fathers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know them then.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have known them both very well for years, and now that you have given\r\nme your names I remember you both.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a few more words, our friends recognized him as a tall,\r\npale-looking man, with whom they had exchanged greetings more than once\r\non their passage from Panama.\r\n\r\n\"I've been down to the Isthmus,\" he added, \"and was on my way home when\r\nthe steamer took fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where were you when you heard the alarm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sound asleep in my berth; I had no time even to put on my clothes; but,\r\nthank God, if I can escape in any way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stick to us, and help shove this craft, and I'm in hopes we'll fetch up\r\nsomewhere by morning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the united propulsion of three men and a large Newfoundland dog,\r\nthe small raft moved shoreward with no insignificant speed. It was found\r\namply sufficient to preserve them all from drowning had none known how\r\nto swim, provided they managed the matter prudently. There is so little\r\ndifference in the quantity of water and the human body, that a slight\r\neffort, if properly made, will keep it afloat. The trouble with new\r\nbeginners is that when they first go beyond their depth their blind\r\nstruggles tend to carry them downward more than upward.\r\n\r\n\"This is rather pleasant,\" remarked Mr. Yard. \"There is little doubt, I\r\nthink, of reaching land. There is only one thing that makes the shivers\r\nrun over me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The thought of _sharks_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ugh! Why did you spake of them?\" asked Tim, with a strong expression of\r\ndisgust. \"I've been thinking of 'em ever since I've been in the water,\r\nbut I didn't want to skeer the boys.\"\r\n\r\n\"They never once entered my head,\" said Howard.\r\n\r\n\"Nor mine either,\" added Elwood. \"Are they in this part of the ocean?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will find them in almost every part of the sea, I was going to say.\r\nThey abound off the coast of California.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is night, and they will not be apt to see!\"\r\n\r\n\"This fire and the numbers of drowning people will draw hundreds of the\r\nfinny inhabitants toward us. You know a fire at night is sure to attract\r\nfish.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem determined to frighten us,\" said Howard, \"but I shall continue\r\nto think that God who has so mercifully saved us intends to save us to\r\nthe end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so, too, but it does no harm to understand all the dangers to\r\nwhich we are subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe with Howard,\" said Elwood. \"I ain't afraid of sharks, but for\r\nall that, they are ugly creatures. They swim under you and the first\r\nthing you know clip goes one of your legs off, just the same as a pair\r\nof snuffers would clip off a piece of wick.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are the hyenas of the sea,\" said Howard, \"although I believe some\r\nkinds are stupid and harmless. I think I have heard them called that by\r\nsomebody, I don't remember who. They will snap up anything that is\r\nthrown to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it make their eyes water to come this way then? Jis' to think\r\nof their saaing four pair of legs dancing over their hids, not to spake\r\nof the dog that could come in by way of dessart.\"\r\n\r\n\"O Tim! keep still, it is too dreadful!\"\r\n\r\n\"Worrah! it wasn't meself that introduced the subject, but as yez have\r\ngot started, I've no objection to continue the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us try and talk about something more pleasant----\"\r\n\r\n\"A shark! a shark!\" suddenly screamed Elwood, springing half his length\r\nout of the water in his excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" demanded Mr. Yard, while the others were speechless with\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n\"He has hold of my leg! O, save me, for he is pulling me under!\"\r\n\r\nThere was danger for a moment that all would go to the bottom, but Mr.\r\nYard displayed a remarkable coolness that saved them all.\r\n\r\n\"It is not a shark,\" said he, \"or he would have had your leg off before\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it then? What can it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a drowning man that has caught your foot as he was going down.\r\nYou must kick him off or he will drown you. Has he one foot or both?\"\r\n\r\n\"My left ankle is grasped by something.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is good; if he had hold of both feet it would be bad for you. Use\r\nyour free foot and force his grasp loose.\"\r\n\r\nElwood did so with such vigor that he soon had the inexpressible relief\r\nof announcing that the drag weight was loosed and his limbs were free\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"That is terrible,\" said he, as they resumed their progress. \"Just to\r\nthink of being seized in that way by some poor fellow who, I don't\r\nsuppose, really knew what he was doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"How came he there?\" asked Howard.\r\n\r\n\"You see, we ain't far from where the steamer sunk, and there may be\r\nmore near us. This man has gone down just as we were passing by him, and\r\nin his blind struggles has caught your ankle.\"\r\n\r\n\"If a drowning man will catch at a straw, wouldn't he be after catching\r\nat a leg?\" inquired Tim.\r\n\r\n\"It seems natural that he should do so; but we are in the most dangerous\r\nplace we could be. Let's keep a sharp lookout.\"\r\n\r\nOur friends peered in every direction, as they rose and sunk on the\r\nlong, heaving swell of the sea. They saw pieces of charred wood and\r\nfragments of the wreck, but caught sight of no human being until Mr.\r\nYard pointed, to a dark mass some distance away.\r\n\r\n\"That is a raft covered with people,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"They seem to be standing still.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they merely want to keep afloat until morning, when no doubt they\r\nwill be picked up and cared for. Keep quiet, for if we talk too loud\r\nsome one may start for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And work hard,\" whispered Tim, struggling harder than ever. \"Aich of\r\nyees shove like a locomotive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good advice,\" added Mr. Yard, in the same cautions undertone. \"Let's\r\nget away as fast as possible.\"\r\n\r\nHour after hour the men toiled, following the moon, that appeared to\r\nrecede from them as they advanced. They had passed safely the debris of\r\nthe wrecked steamer, and were again talking loudly and rather\r\ncheerfully, when Tim O'Rooney interrupted them:\r\n\r\n\"Yonder is something flowting in the darkness.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a boat full of people,\" said Mr. Yard. \"I have noticed it for the\r\nlast few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nAll turned their eyes toward the spot indicated, and agreed that Mr.\r\nYard was correct in his supposition.\r\n\r\n\"I will hail it,\" he quietly added, and then called out: \"Boat ahoy!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" came back in a gruff voice.\r\n\r\n\"Can you take four drowning passengers on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much,\" was the unfeeling answer, \"Paddle away and you'll reach\r\nCalifornia one of these days.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far are we from it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Double the distance, divide by two, and you'll have it.\"\r\n\r\nNothing further was extracted from the men, but they could be heard\r\nlaughing and talking boisterously with each other, and the odor of their\r\npipes was plainly detected, so close were the parties.\r\n\r\n\"Thank heaven, we are not dependent upon them!\" said Mr. Yard. \"If we\r\nwere, we should fare cruelly indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"A part of the crew of the steamer, who seized the boat at the first\r\nappearance of danger, and left the helpless to perish.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later, long after the boat had disappeared, and when our friends\r\nwere toiling bravely forward, a low, dark object directly in front\r\nattracted their notice.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" whispered Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"_It is land!_\" was the joyful reply. \"I am walking upon the sand this\r\nminute, and you can do the same!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE CALIFORNIA COAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were safe at last! The four dropped their feet and found them\r\nresting upon smooth packed sand, and wading a few rods they all stood\r\nupon dry earth. Terror, as he shook his shaggy coat and rubbed his nose\r\nagainst his young masters seemed not the least joyful of the party.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't this grand!\" exclaimed Elwood. \"When did the ground feel better\r\nto your feet? Saved from fire and water!\"\r\n\r\n\"Our first duty is to thank God!\" said Mr. Yard reverently. \"He has\r\nchosen us out of the hundreds that have perished as special objects of\r\nhis mercy. Let us kneel upon the shore and testify our gratitude to\r\nHim.\"\r\n\r\nAll sunk devoutly upon their knees and joined the merchant, as in a low,\r\nimpressive tone he returned thanks to his Creator for the signal mercy\r\nhe had displayed in bringing them safely through such imminent perils.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what is to be done next?\" inquired Mr. Yard, as they arose to\r\ntheir feet and looked around them. \"The first thing I should like to do\r\nis to procure a suit of clothes, and I hope I shall be able to do it\r\nwithout stripping any of the dead bodies that will soon wash ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the naad?\" asked Tim O'Rooney. \"Baing that it's a warrum summer\r\nnight, and there saams to be few in the neighborhood that is likely to\r\ntake exsaptions to your costume.\"\r\n\r\n\"But day is breaking!\" replied the merchant, pointing across the low,\r\nrocky country to a range of mountains in the distance, whose high,\r\njagged tops were blackly defined against the sky that was growing light\r\nand rosy behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it will soon be light,\" said Howard. \"See! there are persons along\r\nthe shore that have come down to the wreck?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are some of the passengers that have managed to reach land. I will\r\ngo among them and see whether any of them have any clothing to sell,\"\r\nlaughed Mr. Yard as he moved away.\r\n\r\nAs the sun came up over the mountains it lit up a dreary and desolate\r\nscene. Away in the distance, until sky and earth mingled into one,\r\nstretched the blue Pacific, not ridged into foam and spray like the\r\nboisterous Atlantic, but swelling and heaving as if the great deep was a\r\nbreathing monster. A few fragments of blackened splinters floating here\r\nand there were all that remained to show where a few hours before the\r\nmagnificent steamer, surcharged with its living freight, so proudly cut\r\nthe waters on her swift course toward the Golden Gate.\r\n\r\nSeveral ghastly, blue-lipped survivors in their clinging garments were\r\nwandering aimlessly along the shore, the veriest pictures of utter\r\nmisery, as they mumbled a few words to each other, or stared absently\r\naround. They seemed to be partially bereft of their senses, and were\r\nprobably somewhat dazed from the fearful scenes through which they had\r\nso recently passed.\r\n\r\nSeveral sails were visible, but they were so far away that it was vain\r\nto hope to attract their attention. Three large boats could be seen away\r\nto the northwest, skirting along shore and making their way toward San\r\nFrancisco as rapidly as muscle and oars could carry them. What recked\r\nthey whether the passengers were buried with the steamer, sunk in the\r\nocean, or left to perish on the desolate coast?\r\n\r\nThe Coast Range, which descends into California from Oregon, in some\r\nplaces comes within twenty-five or thirty miles of the sea, while at\r\nother times it recedes to over a hundred. The particular point where our\r\nfriends were suffered to land was rough, barren and rocky, and behind\r\nthem, with many peaks reaching the line of perpetual snow, rose the\r\nnoble Coast Range, between which and them stretched a smaller range of\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nAround them the country appeared desolate and uninhabited. Howard and\r\nElwood were well acquainted with geography, and had a general idea of\r\nCalifornia, although they could not be expected to know much of the\r\nminor facts of the State. They were aware that at no great distance--but\r\nwhether north or south it was impossible to say--lay the missionary town\r\nof San Luis Obispo, and between them and the Coast Range ran the Salinas\r\nRiver, formerly known as the San Buenaventura, and a smaller chain of\r\nmountains or highlands.\r\n\r\nThey knew, too, that after crossing the Coast Range, you descended into\r\nthe broad and beautiful Sacramento Valley, where abounded wild animals,\r\nIndians, gold, silver, and the most exuberant vegetation. This was about\r\nall they knew; and this, after all, was considerable. When persons\r\nexpect to make a journey to some distant country they are very apt to\r\nlearn all that they possibly can about it; and this was the way they\r\ncame to understand so much regarding the young State of California.\r\n\r\nThey had stood some little time conversing together when they saw Mr.\r\nYard approaching, clad in quite a respectable suit of black, albeit, as\r\na matter of course, it was thoroughly soaked with salt water.\r\n\r\n\"You are fortunate,\" remarked Howard.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he laughed; \"what strange beings we are! Do you see that elderly\r\ngentleman yonder, with his hands in his pockets walking back and forth\r\nas though he expected some arrival from the sea?\"\r\n\r\nThe personage alluded to could be easily distinguished from the others.\r\n\r\n\"Well, his berth was next to mine. When the alarm of fire was first\r\nheard he sprung from his bed, dressed himself and caught up his valise,\r\nwhich contained an extra suit of clothing, and rushed on deck with the\r\nother passengers.\"\r\n\r\n\"How was he saved?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is hard to tell. He and several others hung fast to some such sort\r\nof a raft as we had, and managed to get ashore. And all the time he\r\ngrasped that valise, even when besought by his companions to let it go,\r\nfind when it endangered his chances of life fully ten-fold.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must be very poor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor! He is worth half a million in gold this minute. That valise\r\ncontained all his property that he had entrusted to the steamer, and it\r\nwas his fear that he might lose the few dollars that it is worth that\r\nmade him cling so tenaciously to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How was it that he gave them to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear that he gave them. I stated in the presence of two witnesses\r\nthat, I would give him a hundred dollars for the suit as soon as we\r\nreached San Francisco. He racked his brains to see whether there was not\r\nsome means of my giving him my note for the amount; but as that couldn't\r\nbe done under the circumstances, he did the next best thing and\r\nestablished my obligation in the mouth of several witnesses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange man! But, Mr. Yard, what is to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I intend to wait here during the day, as I know of nothing better that\r\nwe can do. I think some friends will find us before nightfall.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have decided to go inland a short distance, dry our clothes and give\r\nour bodies a good rubbing, to prevent our taking cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"A wise precaution, but useless in my case as I have already caught a\r\nvery severe one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Should we become separated, you will tell our parents that we reached\r\nthe land in safety and are in good spirits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course; but don't wander too far away, as you may lose your chance\r\nof being taken off. You know this isn't the most hospitable country in\r\nthe world. There are treacherous and thieving Indians in these parts,\r\nand they would have swooped down on us long ago if they had only known\r\nwe were here. As it is, I fear their approach before a friendly sail\r\ncomes to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never fear; we will take good care not to wander too far away.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the parties separated for a much longer time than any of them\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE RESCUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur three friends--although it seems equally proper to speak of four, as\r\nTerror was a most important member of the party--walked away from the\r\nsea-shore and began making their way back into the country. As we have\r\nhinted in another place, they found this section wild and desolate.\r\nLittle else than huge rocks, bowlders and stunted trees met the eye,\r\nwhile there was no appearance of vegetation, nor was the slightest\r\nvestige of a human habitation visible, let them look in whatever\r\ndirection they chose.\r\n\r\nThe air was clear, the sky decked by a few fleecy clouds over the\r\nPacific, and there was little doubt that the day would be a fine, warm\r\none. The climate of California is mild, except when the winds from the\r\nPacific bring chilling fogs along the coast. The view in the east was\r\nparticularly grand, the peaks of the gigantic Coast mountains and of the\r\nsmaller range rising and swelling in vast peaks, appearing as if the\r\nPacific when tossed and driven by some hurricane had suddenly congealed\r\nwith the foam upon the tops of its mountainous billows. Looking\r\nnorthward, the last object that met the eye was these mountains\r\ngradually blending with the brilliant sky, while to the southward the\r\nprospect was repeated.\r\n\r\nThey wandered along, springing up the sides of rocks, jumping quite a\r\ndistance to the ground, again passing around those that were too high to\r\nclimb, Terror all the time frolicking at their sides, certainly as happy\r\nas any of them, while they chatted and laughed, their hearts buoyant in\r\nthe beautiful summer and the pleasing retrospect of a thrilling\r\nadventure already safely passed through and the prospect of a few others\r\nclose at hand.\r\n\r\nIn this wandering manner they at last found themselves fully a mile from\r\nshore, and in a wild, rocky place where they felt secure from\r\nobservation. Here all removed their clothes, subjected their bodies to a\r\nvigorous rubbing that made the surface glow with warmth and reaction,\r\nand then spread their garments out to dry. Their extended walk before\r\nreaching this place had partially done the latter for them, so that in\r\nthe course of an hour or so they found them free from all moisture, and\r\nas they donned them they once more felt like themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Elwood, \"I am very tired and sleepy; is not this a good\r\nplace to lie down and rest?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was going to suggest the same thing,\" added Howard. \"I do not see in\r\nwhat better manner we can spend a few hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it's the same idaa that has been strhiking me ever since we sot\r\nfoot in this qua'r looking place. It's meself that is so sleapy that at\r\nivery wink I makes I has to lift the eyelids up with my fingers, and me\r\neyes feels as though the wind has been blowing sand in 'em all day.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposal thus being satisfactory to all, they proceeded to carry it\r\nout at once. The day was so mild that the only precaution necessary was\r\nto secure themselves against the rays of the sun. This was easily done,\r\nand stretching out beneath the shelter of a projecting ledge of rocks\r\nthey had scarcely laid down when all were sound asleep.\r\n\r\nAnd leaving them here for the time being, we give our attention for a\r\nfew moments to the survivors of the steamer.\r\n\r\nSome thirty odd of the passengers succeeded in reaching the shore, while\r\nabout a dozen were saved with the crew, who, as is generally the case at\r\nsuch times, acted upon the idea that it was their duty to take charge of\r\nthe boats and prevent the passengers from risking themselves in such\r\nfrail structures. After all, no doubt their lives were as valuable as\r\nwere those of the hundreds they carried, and their conduct, when viewed\r\nin an unprejudiced manner, perhaps was not so criminal.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of so large a steamer along the California coast, in the\r\nregular track of the vessels going to and coming from Panama, could not\r\noccur without the knowledge of many upon the ocean. Indeed, the glare\r\nupon the heavens was seen far up the coast, and in San Luis Obispo, to\r\nthe south, was pronounced by all to be caused by the burning of some\r\nlarge vessel at sea.\r\n\r\nIt so came about that there were but two vessels near enough to go to\r\nthe relief of the unfortunate steamer; but these were controlled by\r\nrival captains, each of whom hoped to enter the Golden Gate an hour or\r\nso in advance of the other; and therefore they had not time to slacken\r\nsail and lay to, but pressed forward with an expression of regret that\r\nthe necessities of the case compelled them thus to refuse all succor to\r\nthe needy ones.\r\n\r\nBut there were others at a greater distance who bore down upon the fiery\r\nscene at once; but they were miles away when the last vestige of the\r\nsteamer disappeared, and it was only a matter of conjecture as to where\r\na few of the survivors might be struggling with the waves. Not until the\r\nsun had been up over an hour did the man at the mast-head of the nearest\r\nvessel call out that he saw several boats pulling up the coast, while a\r\nfew persons could be seen on the shore making signals to attract their\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nSome time after, the Relief--happily named--cast anchor a half-mile from\r\nland and two boats put off from her side. The survivors were quickly\r\nwithin them, and they were about putting off again when the mate of the\r\nRelief said:\r\n\r\n\"Are you all here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" was the impatient reply of Mr. Tiflings, the man who had\r\nsold the suit of clothes to Mr. Yard, \"don't wait any longer. I shall\r\nlose $500 by not being in San Francisco to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they are not all here,\" interrupted Mr. Yard, in some excitement.\r\n\"There are two boys in charge of an Irishman that are missing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are they?\" asked the mate.\r\n\r\n\"They went back from the shore some time ago. I do not think they can be\r\nat any great distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps if you called to them they might hear you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Yard sprung out upon the beach, ran to and mounted a goodly-sized\r\nrock, and shouted at the top of his voice. He called again and again,\r\nand listened intently, but there was no response.\r\n\r\nAll this time Mr. Tiflings sat leaning his head forward and nervously\r\nbeating a tattoo upon the side of the boat with his long, thin fingers.\r\nOccasionally he glanced at the \"foolish\" Mr. Yard, and muttered:\r\n\r\n\"What nonsense! What valuable time we are losing by his childishness!\r\nTime is too precious to fritter away in this manner!\"\r\n\r\nWhile the kind-hearted merchant was shouting himself hoarse, our friends\r\nwere heavily and sweetly slumbering, totally oblivious to external\r\nthings, as indeed they would have been were he within a few rods of\r\nthem, instead of over a mile away. Finally he was compelled to give up\r\nthe task and reluctantly return to the boat.\r\n\r\n\"This is too bad,\" said he, \"to leave them in this manner. What will\r\nbecome of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"They will be picked up by some of the passing vessels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, certainly,\" assented Mr. Tiflings, \"don't wait any longer;\r\nit will be a week before we get into San Francisco.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will row away,\" said the mate, \"and if we see anything of them\r\nbefore we reach the vessel we will put back and take them aboard.\"\r\n\r\nThis was reasonable, and Mr. Yard could not object to it. The sailors\r\nplied their oars, and the passengers were borne swiftly toward the\r\nfriendly Relief. Mr. Yard kept his eyes fixed upon the bleak coast which\r\nthey were so rapidly leaving behind them. He saw nothing of his friends;\r\nbut, after reaching the ship's deck, he took the spy-glass from the\r\ncaptain and discovered a party of a dozen Indians wandering up and down\r\nthe beach as if in quest of plunder. Finally, sail was hoisted, the\r\nRelief bore away to the northward, and the scene of the rescue dwindled\r\naway and vanished in the distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nINDIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sleep of perfect health is dreamless, and is not easily aroused by\r\nexternal disturbance. Tim O'Rooney, Elwood Brandon and Howard Lawrence,\r\nsweetly forgetful of the need of their being within sight and hearing of\r\nthe shore, slept through the entire day without once awaking. The sun\r\nwas just dipping beneath the Pacific when Howard opened his eyes with\r\nthat confused, indistinct recollection which often takes possession of\r\nour faculties when first aroused from a deep slumber. He stared around\r\nand the sight of the unconscious forms of his two companions, and the\r\nmute Newfoundland dog with his nose between his paws, but blinking as if\r\nto show he \"slept with one eye open,\" quickly recalled his situation. In\r\nconsiderable alarm, he sprung up, and began rousing the others. As they\r\nrubbed their eyes and rose to the sitting position, he said in\r\nexcitement:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know we have slept ever since morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"It can't be possible!\" exclaimed Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"I should say we had slept a waak be the token of the hunger I feels,\"\r\nsaid Tim, with a most woeful countenance.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see any likelihood of our getting anything to digest in these\r\nparts,\" replied Howard.\r\n\r\n\"And where else shall we look for the same?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere that I know of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose some ship has stopped here while we have been asleep!\" suddenly\r\ninterrupted Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't they have looked for us? But then they couldn't have known\r\nwhere we were,\" said Howard, asking and answering his own question in\r\nthe same breath.\r\n\r\n\"We are in a pretty fix then,\" was the comment of Elwood, laughing at\r\nthe doleful countenances he saw.\r\n\r\n\"Boys,\" said Tim, hitching up his pantaloons and scratching his head,\r\n\"shall I tell yees something to your advantage, as the papers say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" answered Howard, \"nothing could suit us better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, while we've been slaaping, our friends along shore have\r\nbeen carried away, and we're lift to make ourselves comfortable, as the\r\npeddler said when he hung himself up by his foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us see!\" exclaimed Elwood, \"perhaps we are not too late yet.\"\r\n\r\nThe three rushed ever the rocks pell-mell, the dog being at their side,\r\nand giving vent now and then to short, sharp barks, as if he enjoyed the\r\nramble.\r\n\r\nElwood was at the head, and had run but a short distance when he sprung\r\nupon a bowlder higher than the others, and shading his eyes for a moment\r\nas he looked off toward the sea, he called back:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yonder they are! We are not left alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's good to have company!\" laughed Tim, \"it won't be long before\r\nsome vessel will step in and lift us aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"How odd they look!\" remarked Elwood, as his friends clambered up beside\r\nhim. \"They don't seem dressed in their usual fashion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irishman, upon rising to his feet on top of the rock, uttered an\r\nexpression of surprise, looked intently toward the sea, and then quickly\r\nsprung back again.\r\n\r\n\"Off of there quick!\" he commanded in a hoarse whisper, at the same time\r\ncatching the shoulder of the up-climbing Howard and forcing him back\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what's the matter?\" asked Elwood, a vague alarm taking possession\r\nof him, as he rather hurriedly obeyed him.\r\n\r\n\"May the good Lord presarve us! _them are Injuns!_\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'May the good Lord preserve us! them are Injuns,' said\r\nTim.\"]\r\n\r\n\"I thought they looked odd,\" said Elwood, \"but I did not think of that.\r\nAre they friendly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Friendly!\" repeated Tim, with an expression of intense disgust. \"Do you\r\nknow what they are walking up and down the sand fur in that sassy\r\nshtyle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plunder, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis; they are in hopes the saa may wash up some poor fellow that they\r\nmay have the pleasure of hacking him to pieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they such terrible creatures. Perhaps they have slain those who\r\nescaped from the steamer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Niver a fear; there was too many of 'em, as me brother used to say when\r\nhis wife tuk her broomstick at him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they had no weapons to use.\"\r\n\r\nTim shook his head. He evidently had a small opinion of the courage of\r\nthe California aborigines.\r\n\r\n\"Had they massacred the survivors, we could see their bodies along\r\nshore,\" remarked Howard. \"The sun throws such a glare upon the sand that\r\nwe can detect a very small object.\"\r\n\r\nThis settled the matter in the mind of Elwood, who had been heartsick at\r\nthe great fear of such a fate having befallen his friends.\r\n\r\n\"Then the burning of the steamer has attracted the notice of a great\r\nmany vessels, and I think Mr. Yard was right when he was sure of being\r\ntaken off by some one.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a mistake we made in wandering away and going to sleep where no\r\none could find us!\"\r\n\r\n\"We did, indeed, Elwood; we voluntarily banished ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Mr. Yard certainly knows we are here, and will he not get a company\r\nof men to come after us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so; but, if he doesn't, your father and mine will certainly do\r\nso, so soon as they find where we are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but what is to become of us between to-night and that time? I am\r\nhalf-starved to death, and must get something to eat pretty soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Providence, that has preserved us so kindly thus far, will still watch\r\nover us.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's one bad thing,\" remarked Tim, \"them Injins will hang around the\r\nshore, and it won't do for us to show ourselves niver a bit.\"\r\n\r\nThe faces of the two boys now blanched with fear, for they understood\r\nthe danger that threatened them. It was truly a fear-inspiring sight, as\r\nthey gazed out from their hiding-place in the direction of the sea. The\r\nsun was partially down the horizon, and appeared unnaturally large,\r\nwhile the gaunt Indians, in their fantastic costume, assumed the form of\r\ngiants striding along apparently on the gleaming surface of the ocean\r\nitself. They were outlined with that sharp, black distinctness which is\r\nseen when at night a fireman runs along the outer walls of a burning\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\"Just to think!\" said Elwood \"we haven't a gun or a pistol with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'm a little hungry, as the man said after fasting three waaks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose they saw you?\" said Howard.\r\n\r\n\"I ain't sure but what they did. They are looking in this direction, and\r\nappear to be disputing about some matter.\"\r\n\r\nThere were grounds for this alarming view of the case. The Indians\r\nnumbered about a dozen, and half of these could be seen in a knot,\r\ngesticulating in their extravagant manner, while the others were running\r\nup and down the shore as if they had detected something interesting in\r\nthe surf.\r\n\r\n\"Are they looking at us?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is such a glare, from the sun that I cannot tell whether their\r\nfaces or backs are toward us. Tim, what do you say?\"\r\n\r\nThe Irishman gazed long and carefully over the face of the rock, and\r\nfinally said:\r\n\r\n\"They've seen something this way that has tuk their eye.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are moving, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe they've seen the dog, and are coming to look for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven save us!\" exclaimed Tim, in some excitement, \"there's no maybe\r\nabout it; they're coming, sure!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE PURSUIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time that Tim O'Rooney made a mistake. The Indians\r\nwere excited over something, but as yet they held no suspicion that\r\nthree white persons stood behind them and could be so easily reached.\r\nThey were talking in a wild manner, and ran several rods from the beach,\r\nwhen they suddenly paused and picked up an object over which they\r\nquarreled and were almost ready to proceed to violence. From where our\r\nfriends stood it looked as if it were nothing more than a coat or some\r\ncast-off garment that had been thrown aside by so me of the survivors\r\nwhen they were taken away by the Relief.\r\n\r\n\"No, they have not seen us yet,\" said Howard, who was watching them\r\nintently, while his two companions where looking upon the readiest means\r\nof escape.\r\n\r\n\"Then why did they start after us, be the same token?\" demanded Tim,\r\nwith a great sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\"They are quarreling over something that lies upon the beach.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they'd only have the onspakable kindness to go to fighting each\r\nother like a lot of Kilkenny cats, and not sthop till there's not one of\r\n'em left--I say if they'd have the kindness to do that, it would be\r\nfortinit for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly probable, Tim; the fact, is they appear to have settled the\r\nmatter already, and have gone down to the edge of the sea again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see the use of our remaining here,\" said Howard. \"We daren't go\r\nany nearer them than we now are, while if we put back into the country\r\nwe stand a chance of getting something to eat. As near as I can\r\ncalculate, the Salinas River isn't very far away, and California is said\r\nto be very fertile along its streams, if it is barren in such places as\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we may come upon a party of miners further inland.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know about that,\" rejoined Howard. \"The diggings are on the\r\nother side of the Coast Range, between that and the Sierra Nevada, in\r\nthe Sacramento Valley, and I think they are further north, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's lave,\" said Tim; \"if we only start tramping perhaps I may git my\r\nmind off the subjact and forgit that I'm hungry enough to eat a toad,\r\nwhich I'd starve to death afore I'd do the same.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus debating with themselves, Terror, unobserved by any\r\nof them, whisked to the top of a high rock and announced his discovery\r\nof the Indians by several loud, gruff barks. At so great a distance it\r\nwas impossible that the dog should be heard, but the danger was that the\r\nlynx-eyed savages would see him, and thus discover the presence of his\r\nfriends. The peril was imminent, and a hasty word from Howard brought\r\nthe Newfoundland to their feet.\r\n\r\nBut it was too late. He had scarcely ascended his perch when an Indian\r\ncaught sight of him, and giving out a strange half-whoop and stream, he\r\nstarted on a full run toward him, closely followed by half of the entire\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\"There's no mistake this time!\" exclaimed Howard, wheeling round and\r\nspringing away. \"Don't wait.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no waiting by either Tim or Elwood. The two boys were slim and\r\nfleet-footed, and could easily distance their more awkward companion;\r\nbut they could not leave him alone, although he besought them to secure\r\ntheir own safety, while he would attend to his.\r\n\r\nThere were several things in favor of the fugitives and several against\r\nthem. It was growing dark quite rapidly, and they had a good start; but\r\nthe pursuers ran over the rocks and bowlders with the facility of\r\nmountain goats and gained very rapidly; they were also familiar with the\r\nface of the country, while our friends were literally \"going blind.\"\r\n\r\n\"But don't we make 'em run!\" called out Tim, glancing over his shoulder.\r\n\"Them fellers was made to travel, and if they'd only throw down their\r\nguns and take up a sprig of the shillaleh, like an ilegant gintleman\r\nshould do, I wouldn't ax better fun than to jine in wid 'em and tach 'em\r\na few scientific tricks, such as can be got in Tipperary and nowhere\r\nilse--Worrah!----\"\r\n\r\nTim's exclamation was caused by catching his foot against a large stone\r\nand falling flat upon his face with considerable violence. He quickly\r\nscrambled up again, while Elwood anxiously inquired whether he was hurt\r\nby the fall.\r\n\r\n\"Not by the fall, plase your honor, but by the stone that whacked me\r\nbetwaan the eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are gaining!\" whispered Howard, pausing a moment for his\r\ncompanions to come up.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it will be so dark in a few minutes that they can't see us,\r\nand then we will hide ourselves until the danger is past. Let us get\r\nalong an fast as possible while the danger lasts.\"\r\n\r\nThey did strain themselves to the utmost, and speedily reached a more\r\nopen country, where they could travel with greater safety. This, which\r\nat first appeared sadly against their prospects, was really the means of\r\nsecuring their escape. The moment they reached it they darted away at\r\nalmost double their rate of speed, and shortly reached another hilly\r\nportion, into which they plunged, and running a short distance, at a\r\nsignal from Howard, they dropped flat upon their faces, and crawled\r\nbeneath thy sheltering projections of the rocks, Terror at the same time\r\nnestling down by the prostrate form of Elwood.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes they heard the tramp of their swift-footed pursuers,\r\nwho were running without exchanging words with each other, or uttering\r\nthose exultant whoops which the Indian of other portions of our country\r\nare so accustomed to give when exulting in the certainty of capturing\r\ntheir enemies.\r\n\r\nOur friends did not venture to exchange a word with each other until a\r\nlong time after the Indians had passed, and nothing could be heard to\r\nindicate that they were anywhere in the neighborhood. Then they crawled\r\nnear together and spoke in low whispers.\r\n\r\n\"They are gone!\" said Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" replied Howard, \"but they may be watching somewhere. We\r\nmust be very careful. How is it, Terror, are there any strangers near\r\nus?\"\r\n\r\nThe dog snuffed the air, but made no sound, which was a negative reply.\r\n\r\n\"I guess he is right,\" added Howard. \"We will get as far away from here\r\nas we can, for I am sure those Indians will look around here until\r\nmorning in the hope of getting us then.\"\r\n\r\nAll three crawled a considerable ways on their hands and knees, when\r\nthey stealthily arose to their feet, and seeing nothing suspicious,\r\nfollowed a northeasterly direction--one that would both lead them away\r\nfrom their pursuers and at the same time take them toward the Salinas or\r\nSan Buenaventura River, which point they hoped to reach some time the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nAfter going some distance they walked more rapidly, and ventured to\r\nexchange words with each other. Terror kept the advance, fully aware of\r\nthe responsibility that rested upon him. There was little fear but that\r\nhe would give timely notice of the approach of danger, and a sense of\r\ncomparative security took possession of our friends as they proceeded.\r\n\r\nTo their great surprise, after journeying a half-mile or so, the\r\ncharacter of the country underwent a great change. The ground became\r\nmore level, and they found themselves traveling among stunted trees and\r\nsparse vegetation. The moon did not rise until quite late, so that until\r\nthen they could barely see each other's bodies as they moved along. This\r\nmade them uncertain as to whether they were following the right course;\r\nbut they were greatly pleased to find that they had deviated but\r\nslightly from the line they intended to pursue.\r\n\r\nAll at once a low whine from Terror arrested them. At the same instant\r\nall three detected the glimmer of a light among the trees. Cautiously\r\napproaching, Tim O'Rooney in the advance, he said in his husky whisper:\r\n\r\n\"There's an owld Injin noddin' by the fire, and if he has a gun, or\r\nanything to eat, we'll try and get him to lend 'em to us!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nA GOOD SAMARITAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three carefully approached the camp-fire, and soon assured themselves\r\nthat there was but a single person near it, an old Indian who sat with\r\nclosed eyes and nodding head, totally unmindful of their presence.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he is all alone,\" remarked Howard, in response to the statement\r\nthat Tim had made on first seeing the fire. \"But he has no gun, so far\r\nas I can see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has he anything to eat?\" inquired Elwood. \"For that is getting to be\r\nthe most important matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"There doesn't appear to be any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jist howld still where you baas, till I takes a look around,\" said Tim,\r\nwith an admonitory wave of the hand.\r\n\r\nThey obeyed while he went still nearer on tiptoe. When he was scarcely\r\ntwenty feet away he paused, and stooping down and bending his head first\r\nto one side and then to the other, and raising and arching his neck\r\nuntil his longitudinal dimensions became fearful, he at last satisfied\r\nhimself that the Indian was alone.\r\n\r\nWithout moving his feet, Tim now turned his head and motioned for his\r\ncompanions to join him. They did so very carefully and silently, and the\r\nthree men then stood where the light of the fire shone full in their\r\nfaces, and where they could not help being the first objects the Indian\r\nwould see when he was pleased to look up.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to wake him,\" whispered Tim, \"and shall I yill, or hit him\r\nwith a stone on top of the head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither; I have heard that the slumber of Indians is very light, and if\r\nyou just speak or make a slight noise I have no doubt it will rouse\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nThe fire, which had at its first kindling been large, was now\r\nsmouldering as though it had not been touched for several hours. The\r\nIndian was seated on a large stone, his arms hanging listlessly over his\r\nknees, and his head sunk so low that his features could not be seen.\r\nInstead of the defiant scalp-lock drooping from his crown, his hair was\r\nlong and luxuriant, and plentifully mixed with gray. It hung loosely\r\nover his shoulders, and in front of his face, and helped to give him a\r\nstrange, repulsive appearance.\r\n\r\n\"I say, owld gintleman, are you draaming, or--\"\r\n\r\nAs quick as lightning the head of the Indian flashed up, and his black\r\neyes were centered with a look of alarm upon the individuals before him.\r\nTim had had some experience with these people when a miner, and he now\r\nbegan making signs to the savage, who seemed on the point of springing\r\nup and darting away. Naturally enough the Irishman continued talking,\r\nalthough it was certain that the one could not understand a word the\r\nother uttered.\r\n\r\n\"We maan no harrum,\" said the Irishman, raising his hands and letting\r\nthem fall at his side, to show that he carried no weapons, and held good\r\nwill toward the stranger. The boys judged it best to imitate their\r\ncomrade; and after standing a few moments, the three walked quietly up\r\nto the fire. The startled Indian instantly rose to his feet and placed\r\nhis hand upon the haft of a large knife at his waist.\r\n\r\n\"None of that, ye spalpeen, or I'll smash you to smithereens!\" said Tim,\r\nwho, although his words were of such dire portent, spoke as gently as if\r\nhe were seeking to quiet an infant.\r\n\r\nThey now noticed that the Indian was very old. His face was scarred and\r\nwrinkled, his body bent, and his limbs tottered as if scarcely able to\r\nbear his weight; but his eye was as keen and defiant as the eagle's, and\r\nhe stood ready to defend himself if harm were offered him.\r\n\r\nTim did the most prudent thing possible. He advanced straight to the\r\nsavage and offered his hand. This means of salutation was understood by\r\nthe latter, who, after some tottering hesitation, raised his right hand\r\nfrom the knife and returned the pressure. Dropping it, he looked toward\r\nElwood and Howard, who saluted him in the same manner, and the parties\r\nwere now satisfied regarding the feelings of each other.\r\n\r\n\"Ask him for something to eat!\" said Elwood; \"I am beginning to feel\r\nfaint for the want of food.\"\r\n\r\n\"What good will the same do? He hasn't anything to give.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must live some way himself, and what will support such an old man as\r\nhe is, is surely good for us.\"\r\n\r\nThe signs that Tim now made were unmistakable in their import. He opened\r\nhis huge mouth until the cavern was fearful to contemplate; then he\r\nsnapped his teeth together like a dog that has failed to catch a piece\r\nof meat thrown to him; after which he carried his hand back and forth to\r\nhis mouth, and opened and shut it again.\r\n\r\nThe Indian watched these manuevers a moment, and then gave an\r\nexclamation intended solely for his own benefit--and which, therefore,\r\nit is not necessary to give, if we could, and we can't--and turning his\r\nback, commenced moving away with the feeble, uncertain gait of old age.\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\" inquired Howard.\r\n\r\nThe savage, seeing they did not follow, paused and looked back.\r\n\r\n\"That is an invitation,\" said Tim; \"do yees foller.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where will he lead us?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell?\"\r\n\r\n\"But it may be into danger,\" admonished the most cautious Howard.\r\n\r\n\"It's the only chance we've got to save ourselves from starving, and for\r\nme getting a shmoke out of a pipe, which I am as hungry for as I am for\r\na few pounds of mate.\"\r\n\r\nThe three, the Irishman taking the lead, did not hesitate longer, but\r\nstepped forward, and the Indian immediately resumed his guidance. The\r\nboys could not avoid some alarm and misgiving in thus following blindly\r\nan Indian whom they had not seen until a few minutes before, and who,\r\nthey had every reason to believe, was hostile; but there seemed no other\r\ncourse, and they obeyed the suggestion of Tim O'Rooney.\r\n\r\nThe Indian led the way for several hundred yards, when he halted before\r\none of the rudest and oddest habitations imaginable. It was made of\r\nstones, stumps, limbs, dirt and skins, its dimensions being about twenty\r\nfeet in every direction. The savage paused but a moment when he shoved a\r\nlarge skin aside, entered and held it open for his friends to do the\r\nsame. Tim O'Rooney peered cautiously into the lodge before trusting\r\nhimself within it, but seeing nothing alarming, he stepped briskly\r\nforward, and was followed by the two boys and Terror.\r\n\r\nA dim fire was burning in one corner, against the face of a rock, and\r\nopposite it lay a bundle of clothes, which, upon being rather roughly\r\ntouched by the foot of the Indian, resolved itself into a being of the\r\nfeminine gender, unquestionably the partner of the master of the lodge.\r\nA few words were exchanged between the two, when the squaw busied\r\nherself in preparing a meal, while her husband stirred the fire into a\r\ncheerful blaze that brightly illuminated every portion of the singular\r\ndwelling. He seemed entirely forgetful of the presence of the strangers,\r\nwho seated themselves upon a broad flat stone and calmly awaited the\r\nresult of his doings.\r\n\r\nThe old lady speedily appeared with a huge piece of meat, which was soon\r\nroasting on the fire, its savory odor filling the apartment, and\r\nrendering our friends half frantic in their starving condition. It was\r\nquickly cooked; the Indian severed it into four equal portions with his\r\nhunting-knife, and tossed one to each of his visitors, including the\r\ndog, which was really suffering for the want of nourishment.\r\n\r\nAs Elwood and Howard ravenously ate the well-cooked, juicy meat, free\r\nfrom pepper and salt, they were sure they had never tasted such a\r\ndelicious morsel in all their life. The pieces were of a generous size,\r\nand after all three had gormandized themselves until, absolutely, they\r\ncould contain no more, each had some left. This, as a matter of course,\r\nwas thrown to Terror, and by the time he had swallowed them all, he\r\nlicked his jaws to show that his pangs of hunger were also fully\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nFURTHER EAST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With your lave?\" said Tim O'Rooney, stepping forward and drawing the\r\npipe of their Indian host from his mouth. The latter gazed at him in\r\namazement but said nothing, and offered no objection to the impudent\r\nproceeding.\r\n\r\n\"I fales better,\" complacently added the Irishman as he emitted volume\r\nafter volume of tobacco smoke. \"We've had a good schlape, a good male,\r\nand I'm quieting my narves with the ould gintleman's pipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"It strikes me, Tim, you were rather discourteous,\" said Elwood. \"Be\r\ncareful that we do not trespass too much on his good nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the calomel o' pace, as they calls it, and when you shmoke it\r\nit manes there's no enmity atween us. You see, the ould gintleman and\r\nmeself have shmoked it together, and that makes us frinds. That is a\r\nwise shtroke of policy on the part of Tim O'Rooney, beside the comfort\r\nit gives him. Will aither of yez indulge in a few whiffs?\"\r\n\r\nBoth replied that they did not use the weed in any form.\r\n\r\n\"That's right. It makes me indignant when I sees a youngster puffing\r\naway at a pipe or a segar; but never mind that, boys; do yez jist look\r\nover the top of our ould frind's head and tell me whether yez sees\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have noticed that fine-looking rifle before,\" replied Howard; \"I only\r\nwish each of us had such a one.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will have that before we lave this mansion. Do ye mind that, boys?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will starve to death before I will consent to take it away from the\r\nold Indian after the kind treatment he has given us,\" said Howard.\r\n\r\n\"So would I,\" promptly added Elwood. \"No matter how badly we may want it\r\nI shall never consent to steal it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shtale it! Who talks of shtaling it!\" indignantly demanded Tim. \"You're\r\na couple of fine spalpeens, ain't you, to think that of me. I mane to\r\nbuy it, and give the ould man his own price.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you to buy it with?\" asked Elwood in surprise. \"I have a\r\nlittle money, but I don't believe it is enough to buy such a\r\ngood-looking gun as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; if your pockets were lined with gold pieces he would care nothing\r\nfor them,\" said Howard; \"but what will you offer him, Tim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Each of you has a knife, and likewise have I; you carry two pretty fine\r\ngold watches, while I've a bull's-eye as big as a half-dozen like them.\r\nAn Injun will sell his squaw and lodge for such trifles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, try it, then.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irishman arose to his feet when, as a matter of course, the black\r\neye of the old man was fixed upon him. He pointed to the gun overhead,\r\nwhereupon the Indian, with surprising quickness, caught it down and held\r\nit with a nervous grasp, his squaw taking his seat beside him. Tim\r\noffered the three knives which the party owned for it, opening and\r\nflicking them to excite his cupidity. The eager look that came into his\r\nface showed that he understood what was meant; but he only hugged his\r\nproperty more tightly and shook his head from side to side.\r\n\r\n\"I knew he wouldn't part with it,\" said Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"Howld on a minute,\" replied Tim; \"I'm only throwing out me skirmishers;\r\nI'll fetch him yet. He's larned how to make a bargain.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irishman now produced his watch--an immense affair that would have\r\nmade a load for a small child. He pried open its gigantic case and\r\nshowed the dazzling array of brass wheels and the glittering coil of\r\nsteel. It could not but be attractive to a savage mind, and the Indian's\r\neyes sparkled as he looked upon it.\r\n\r\n\"Keep yours and let me offer mine,\" said Howard.\r\n\r\n\"Howld on, I tell yees, howld on; maybe you'll both have to offer 'em\r\nafore he'll bite. My repater is like myself--it took too much salt water\r\nfor its good and hasn't been well for a few months. If the ould thing\r\nwould only tick a little he couldn't resist it; it has a beautiful voice\r\nwhen it starts--like a thrashing machine.\"\r\n\r\nEqually to the surprise of Tim and the boys, the savage arose and handed\r\nthe gun to the Irishman, who was only too glad to put his watch and\r\nthree knives into his possession.\r\n\r\n\"I only wish he had a couple more,\" said Howard, \"so that we could each\r\nget one. We ought to be able to take care of ourselves then.\"\r\n\r\nTim in the meantime was turning the rifle over in his hand and examining\r\nit with an appearance of great pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"That come from San Francisco,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"How did it reach these parts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aisy enough, as me uncle said when he fell off the house. Some trader\r\nhas let him have it for about five hundred dollars' worth of furs and\r\npeltries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't forget the ammunition,\" admonished Elwood, \"or the gun will do us\r\nlittle good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Worrah! it's meself that came nigh doin' the same. That's a fine\r\npowdther-horn that he has. I say, Misther----\"\r\n\r\nTim now began motioning very earnestly for this article, bullet-pouch\r\nand box of percussion caps that the savage had at his side; but the\r\nshrewd old fellow was sharper than they expected. He indulged in a\r\npeculiar grin, and held them very rigidly.\r\n\r\nHoward laughed.\r\n\r\n\"You don't get anything more without paying for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall I pay? I've alriddy overdrawn me bank account, as they say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him take my watch,\" said Elwood. \"Fact is, I think it has been\r\nruined by the salt water.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that's too much; haven't ye got some trinket about yees that isn't\r\ngood for nothing and that you doesn't want?\"\r\n\r\nThe boys searched themselves. Elwood finally produced a small silver\r\npencil.\r\n\r\n\"Just the thing,\" said Tim.\r\n\r\nBut the old Indian, evidently failed to consider it just the thing, for\r\nhe continued obdurate and shook his head.\r\n\r\nA new idea struck Howard. He wrenched off several brass buttons from his\r\ncoat, and handed them to Tim. The eyes of their host fairly sparkled, as\r\ndoes a child's at sight of a coveted toy, and rising to his feet he\r\ntottered hastily toward them, and tossed the coveted articles into the\r\nIrishman's lap.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if the owld gentleman would only dispose of his pipe and a ton or\r\ntwo of tobaccy to me, or make me a prisent of 'em, I'd lave and feel\r\naisy.\"\r\n\r\nA few more brass buttons procured this also, and our friends had good\r\ncause to feel delighted over the result of the bargain.\r\n\r\n\"There doesn't seem to be anything more that we can do, and it strikes\r\nme that it would be prudent for us to leave,\" said Howard.\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" added Elwood. \"I believe there are other Indians at hand,\r\nor within call, else he wouldn't be so willing to part with his gun.\"\r\n\r\nThe savage now rose and acted in rather a singular manner. Walking to\r\nthe opening which answered for a door, he passed out and motioned for\r\nhis visitors to follow. They did so, and when upon the outside he\r\npointed off to the east, nodded his head, and swept his left arm.\r\n\r\n\"What does he mean?\" asked Howard, totally at a loss to understand him.\r\n\r\n\"He means that this is the direction for us to follow.\"\r\n\r\n\"He maans, too, that there's danger in waiting here, and that we'd\r\nbetter be thramping.\"\r\n\r\nElwood took a step or two in the direction indicated to test the meaning\r\nof their friend. He nodded very earnestly, and satisfied them all that\r\nthe safest plan was for them to leave as soon as possible, and take the\r\ncourse pointed out by him.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, thanking him as well as they could by signs, the three\r\nmoved away toward the east.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE SALINAS VALLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur friends journeyed forward until broad daylight, when they found\r\nthemselves fairly among the high range of hills which in this portion of\r\nCalifornia comes down almost to the edge of the sea. The scenery was\r\nbleak and rugged, and the country was barren and showed very few signs\r\nof vegetation, so that for all practical purposes they were little\r\nbetter than if in the sandy desert of the south-eastern portion of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThey observed, too, a disagreeable change in the climate. The moist\r\nwinds of the Pacific being cooled by these mountains caused the air to\r\nbecome chilly and foggy and all felt the need of additional clothing.\r\n\r\nThey had now concluded to pass through these hills to the Salinas Valley\r\nand then follow this northward until they reached the more settled\r\nportion of California, or come upon a party of miners or hunters, in\r\nwhose company they could feel safe against the treacherous Indians, and\r\nwho might perhaps afford them their much-needed weapons and more\r\nabundant food.\r\n\r\nThe latter question assumed the first importance with them. They saw no\r\nfruits, and very few animals. The discharge of their rifle was\r\ndangerous, as it could be heard at a great distance, and if there is any\r\ncreature that is extraordinarily inquisitive it is the American\r\naborigine.\r\n\r\nSeveral times they heard the faint report of guns in the distance, but\r\nfor some days saw no human beings except themselves. At night, when they\r\nlay down to rest, Terror kept a more faithful watch over them than\r\neither of their number could do. They generally found some secure place\r\namong the rocks where they could slumber in safety.\r\n\r\nOn the third day after the shipwreck they crossed the dividing ridge and\r\nhad a view of Salinas or San Buenaventura Valley. It was comparatively\r\nnarrow, looking straighter than it really was, from the towering Coast\r\nRange that rose in vast massive ridges, several of the peaks piercing\r\nthe clouds and reaching far up into the snow line. This was indeed an\r\nimpassable barrier to their further progress beyond the valley, had they\r\nwished to make the attempt; for among those wild regions, where at\r\nmidsummer the snow is whirled in blinding eddies, and the storm howls\r\nthrough gorges and canyons, and the lost traveler gropes blindly for a\r\nsecure foothold along the mountain paths--it would have been fatal for\r\nthem to venture without a sure guide.\r\n\r\nThe Salinas Valley looked like a garden to them, and was indeed a\r\npromised land. There was fruit in abundance, and every prospect of\r\nmeeting some of their own people. The Buenaventura, years ago, was a\r\nfabled river, and the geographies made it a huge stream, taking every\r\ncourse except the true one. They found it a river inferior in breadth\r\nand length to the Hudson, but vastly more interesting from its primeval\r\ncharacter and the wild scenery along its banks.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern slope of the mountains they discerned a great variety of\r\ntrees, among them the _Palo Colorado_ or Lambertine fir, some of them a\r\ndozen feet in diameter, although they did not attain any remarkable\r\nheight. These were not the colossal pines so famous the world over.\r\nThere were quite a number of beech, sycamore, oak, spruce, and maple,\r\nand other trees whose particular names they were unable to tell.\r\n\r\nThere was a noticeable change in the climate also. The air had parted\r\nwith a great deal of its moisture, and although very warm, it had a\r\ndryness about it that made it more grateful and pleasant than the\r\ncoolness along the coast.\r\n\r\nWhen fairly in the Salinas Valley, and along the river, they found the\r\nvegetation remarkably luxuriant. Oats grew wild in many places, and the\r\nplants partook greatly of a tropical character. Grapes were very\r\nabundant, although it was too early in the season to find them ripe; yet\r\nthey gathered a few berries that were very pleasant to the taste.\r\n\r\nThe first day among the hills was spent like the first one on\r\nshore--without food, although they had so gormandized themselves on the\r\npreceding evening that they were able to stand this privation much\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nOn the second morning among the hills, just as they had risen and\r\nresumed their journey, Terror gave notice of something unusual in his\r\ncharacteristic manner--by halting and uttering a low whine. At that\r\nmoment they were making their way around a huge mass of rocks, in a path\r\nthat seemed to have been worn by the feet of wild animals. Tim paused,\r\ncocked his rifle and held it ready for instant use, while the boys\r\nlooked around for some covert into which to retreat, if danger\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\nWhile they stood in anxious suspense, an animal about the size of Terror\r\nwalked leisurely into view, and catching sight of the strangers raised\r\nits head with a look of alarm, then uttered a shrill _baa-aa_ after the\r\nmanner of affrighted sheep, and turned to flee. But he was too valuable\r\na prize to be let run away in this manner, and ere he could turn round,\r\nor the Newfoundland could reach him, Tim had sent a bullet through his\r\nhead that tumbled him over and over as if he had been hit by a\r\ncannon-ball.\r\n\r\nHurrying up to him, they found they had been fortunate enough to secure\r\na good large mountain sheep, a species of animal that run wild in\r\nCalifornia, and at certain seasons of the year are in prime condition.\r\nThis was found only tolerable, but he was fully appreciated by our\r\nfriends. Tim O'Rooney had managed to conceal a second knife about his\r\nperson when bargaining with the Indian--one made on the liberal ideas\r\nthat was displayed in the construction of his watch, and far more useful\r\nthan the ornamental trifles that the boys carried.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this and the anatomical knowledge he possessed, he was\r\nnot long in dressing the sheep, and everything was made ready for\r\ncooking him. The sticks were placed together, the choice steaks were\r\nsuspended on cross pieces, and the leaves heaped up, only awaiting\r\nignition.\r\n\r\n\"I declare!\" exclaimed Howard, \"how are we going to kindle it?\"\r\n\r\nEvery face looked blank, for the thought had never entered their minds\r\nuntil that moment.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't yees a match about you?\" he asked, turning to the boys.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough the two searched every pocket, and having finished\r\nsearched them over again, even turning them wrong side out, and then\r\nturning them in and turning them wrong side out again; but all in vain,\r\nthere was not a lucifer in the party.\r\n\r\n\"Too bad!\" exclaimed Elwood, \"we are all as hungry as we can be, and we\r\nshall have to remain so for the want of fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we wait a while we'll not need the match.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't very hard to git hungry enough to ate the same without waiting\r\nfor the benefit of cooking.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't do that,\" added Elwood, with an expression of disgust.\r\n\r\n\"Nor can I,\" added Howard.\r\n\r\n\"I've done it, and found it tasted good,\" said Tim, \"and so would\r\nyez--but howld on! One of yez whack me over the head!\"\r\n\r\n\"For what?\" they demanded in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"For being an owld fool, and be the same towken it's yourselves that is\r\nthe same.\"\r\n\r\n\"We do not understand you,\" they said, in some perplexity.\r\n\r\n\"Yez are talking about fire when we has it here at hand.\"\r\n\r\nThey looked inquiringly around, but did not understand the allusion\r\nuntil he began loading the gun, when a new light broke upon them, and\r\nthey smiled knowingly at each other.\r\n\r\nTim put in a good wadding composed of dry leaves, and placing the muzzle\r\nof his gun among the leaves that they had gathered for ignition, he\r\ndischarged it. The intense flame of fire that streamed forth for an\r\ninstant communicated itself to the kindlings, and this being quickly and\r\nvigorously blown by all three, almost immediately spread into a blaze,\r\nthe wood gathered heat speedily, and in a few minutes the juicy steaks\r\nof the mountain sheep were steaming and ready for the voracious mouths\r\nof the four gathered around.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nANOTHER BARGAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur friends were prudent enough to cook every available portion of the\r\nmountain sheep, and to preserve what remained for future contingencies.\r\nThe climate was so warm that they could not hope to keep it more than a\r\nday or two; and, as it was, they took the wise course of placing as much\r\nof it within their stomachs as they could conveniently carry. The\r\ngood-tempered red Newfoundland seemed to be growing corpulent on this\r\nspecies of living, protracted hunger alternating with an over supply of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThey saw no more wild animals during the day, but just as they were\r\nentering the Salinas Valley Elwood discovered something lying in the\r\npath before them which at first he believed to be an Indian, either\r\nasleep or dead; but Terror instantly ran up, and seizing it in his teeth\r\nlaid it at his feet, and discovered a beautiful Indian blanket.\r\n\r\n\"Strange!\" exclaimed the boy, holding it up before him. \"This shows that\r\nwe are not the first persons who have traversed this section.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder that we do not see more savages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it beautiful?\" said Elwood, turning the blanket over and\r\nexamining its texture and designs. It was indeed handsome and very\r\nvaluable, resembling much the famous blankets made by the Apache\r\nIndians. It was fully a half-inch in thickness, so compactly knit\r\ntogether as to be water-proof. Its border and the design of the figures\r\nwere a miracle of skill in color and combination. Every hue of the\r\nrainbow seemed reproduced in the most pleasing combinations. The\r\ncenter-piece was a figure of the sun which, with the rays radiating from\r\nit, was of a most intense yellow, while around the border were pictured\r\nall the fruits that any one has ever heard as being indigenous to\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n\"That must be very valuable,\" said Howard.\r\n\r\n\"It is so heavy it tires my arms to hold it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That same thing would bring yez five hundred dollars, any day, in San\r\nFrancisco,\" added Tim O'Rooney. \"It'll pay yez to carry it there.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is just the thing to wrap around us when we lie down to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, if ye wraps up in that yez'll wake up and find yersilves roasted\r\nto dith. Yez might as well crawl into an oven and bake yersilves and be\r\ndone with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can then spread it on the ground, and protect ourselves from the\r\nmoisture!\" said Howard, who was beginning to appreciate the value of the\r\narticle.\r\n\r\n\"I've saan them things before,\" added Tim O'Rooney. \"The Apaches and\r\nMohaws in New Mexico make 'em. It has tuk a couple of squaws the bist\r\npart of a year to do the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where is the owner? An Indian could not lose such a thing without\r\nknowing it. Why, it is a load to carry, and I should expect to lose my\r\ncoat as soon as to part with this.\"\r\n\r\nOf course there could be no explanation of the cause of the blanket\r\nbeing found where it was. It was plain that no Indian could have parted\r\nwith it unknowingly, and its high value made it still more puzzling that\r\nit should have been left in such a place. It might be that the\r\nowner--some fragile Indian girl--had wearied with carrying it, and had\r\nthrown it down for a warrior friend of hers to pick up and take to its\r\ndestination for her.\r\n\r\nThis conjecture, made by Tim O'Rooney himself, raised a serious question\r\nas to whether they had a right to carry the blanket away when there was\r\ngood reason to doubt its being lost or abandoned.\r\n\r\n\"If a year's work has been lavished upon it,\" said Elwood, \"it cannot be\r\npossible that it has no owner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think Tim is right; he or she expects to return or send and get it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is singular that if such is the case it should be left here,\r\nwhen it could have been easily hid in these bushes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That only proves that there are no people about--no white ones at\r\nleast. If the owner had any fear of this place being visited by\r\n_Christians_, he would have taken pains to hide his property; but as he\r\nwas sure there were none but savages and heathen, he was certain his\r\nblanket was safe.\"\r\n\r\nHoward Lawrence, jesting though he was, spoke the truth, and deeply\r\nashamed are we to confess it.\r\n\r\nThe question received an unexpected and unmistakable solution. While\r\nthey were still conversing, they descried a gaudily dressed, rather\r\nhandsome-looking squaw tripping lightly behind them. Her head was bent,\r\nand she did not discover them until the growl of the dog caused her to\r\nraise her head. She was then within a dozen yards of Howard, he being in\r\nthe rear and holding the blanket in his hand. She looked at them with an\r\nalarmed expression in her strange dark eyes, and seemed to be too much\r\nfrightened to think of fleeing.\r\n\r\nHoward signified his friendship by walking quietly toward her and\r\nholding out the blanket as if inviting her to take it. She readily\r\ncomprehended the meaning of his advance, and when the article was within\r\nreach she took it.\r\n\r\n\"Now make a bargain if you can,\" called out Elwood.\r\n\r\nHoward produced the gold watch--a small hunting-case--and offered it to\r\nthe young woman. She examined it with childish curiosity, but in a\r\nmanner that showed that it was not the first time she had looked upon\r\nsuch an article. She held it a for moments, and then with a pleased\r\nsmile passed the blanket to him, bowed gracefully, wheeled quickly, and\r\nslipped away charmingly.\r\n\r\n\"Hurra!\" fairly shouted Elwood, \"you are as good as Tim at making a\r\nbargain.\"\r\n\r\n\"She must live somewhere about here, and no doubt will tell how she got\r\nthe watch, and that may set some of her friends on our track.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let 'em come,\" said Tim. \"I've a gun that I larned how to shoot, and\r\nthat blanket we can wrap around us, and I don't believe you could shoot\r\na bullet through it by raison of its thickness.\"\r\n\r\nThe party resumed their journey, quite jubilant over the rifle and\r\nblanket. They still needed but one thing, or rather two things, guns for\r\nthe boys. Terror was such a sharp and faithful sentinel they would have\r\nfelt almost safe with these additional fire-arms. Howard and Elwood were\r\nquite confident that they could shoot with remarkable precision,\r\nalthough, neither had ever aimed or discharged a gun; but in this\r\nrespect they were not so very different from other boys.\r\n\r\nAt noon they made a hearty meal upon a portion of what still remained of\r\nthe mountain sheep, and then stretched themselves out for an hour's\r\nrest. Tim O'Rooney was plentifully supplied with tobacco, and perhaps\r\ncould not have felt more comfortable or satisfied with his situation. He\r\nlolled on the grass, and wondered whether Mr. Lawrence was anxious for\r\nhim to get home or not, finally reaching the conclusion that he was\r\nrather indifferent upon the subject himself. The greatest distress of\r\nHoward and Elwood was the pain that their parents would feel regarding\r\nthem; but they hoped to reach home without great delay, when they would\r\nquickly turn their weeping into joy.\r\n\r\nThe two could not grow weary of admiring their beautiful blanket. It was\r\na wonderful affair indeed, and doubtless contained within it enough\r\nmaterial to supply a \"shoddy\" contractor with the basis for a thousand\r\narmy blankets. The boys would have willingly given both their watches\r\nfor it and considered themselves greatly the gainers. They looked upon\r\nit as their joint property.\r\n\r\n\"I do believe it is rifle-proof,\" said Howard. \"The fine threads of\r\nwhich it is composed are woven so compactly that you can hardly\r\ndistinguish them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be rather fearful of risking a rifle-shot from any one if that\r\nwere all that protected me.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can easily test it. Let's hung it up and shoot a bullet at it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that would be too bad. The ball might go through, and then it would\r\nbe spoiled in its looks. Now it seems really perfect----\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, me boys----\"\r\n\r\nTim's utterance was checked by the discharge of a rifle and the near\r\nwhistle of the bullet. He started up and glanced around him.\r\n\r\n\"Injuns, or me name isn't Tim O'Rooney, from Tipperary, Ireland, the gem\r\nof the say!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nA STRANGE OCCURRENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a slight eminence, about an eighth of a mile south of them, stood the\r\nsolitary Indian who had fired the alarming shot, he was in open view, as\r\nthough he had no fears of the results of his challenge, and appeared to\r\nbe surveying the white people with an air of curiosity that they should\r\npresume to encroach upon his hunting-grounds.\r\n\r\n\"If yez manes that, there's two of us, as me brother Pat towld the judge\r\nwhen he called him a good-for-nothing dog.\"\r\n\r\nWith which exclamation Tim O'Rooney sighted his rifle at the aborigine,\r\nand taking a tedious, uncomfortable aim, pulled the trigger, and then\r\nlowered his piece and stared at his target to watch the result. The\r\nIndian stood as motionless as a statue, and finally the Irishman drew a\r\ndeep sigh.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder whether the bullet has reached him yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Reached him!\" laughed Howard. \"I saw it clip off a piece of rock fully\r\nforty feet from him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Worrah, worrah! but I've ate so much dinner I can't howld the gun\r\nstiddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw it vibrate----\"\r\n\r\n\"Look out! he's going to shoot again!\" called Elwood, as he and Howard\r\ndropped on their faces. \"Get down, Tim, or he'll hit you. He's a better\r\nmarksman than you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who cares----Heaven! save me!\"\r\n\r\nThe second discharge sent the bullet within a few inches of the\r\nIrishman's face, and somewhat alarmed him.\r\n\r\n\"Load quick!\" admonished Howard, \"and shelter yourself, or you are a\r\ndead man.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irishman obeyed this, and had his gun reloaded in a few moments.\r\n\r\n\"Now let me try my hand,\" said Elwood; \"you can never hit him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be all manes, if yez wish it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The piece is too heavy for me to shoot off-hand and I'll rest it on my\r\nknee.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy took the gun, and placing the barrel on his knee, drew back the\r\nhammer, when presto! the savage whisked out of sight like magic. The\r\nnoble aborigine had come to the conclusion that discretion was the\r\nbetter part of valor.\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\" asked the bewildered boy, rising to his feet and looking\r\naround him.\r\n\r\n\"He is gone,\" replied Howard.\r\n\r\n\"I admire his sense; he doesn't care about being shot just yet.\"\r\n\r\nHoward laughed.\r\n\r\n\"You have a good opinion of your marksmanship, Elwood, and he seems to\r\nfear you more than Tim.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he didn't give me time to practice on 'im,\" said the latter. \"If he\r\nhad stood there an hour or two I'd hit him sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and he would have picked you off at the next fire. He's a good\r\nmarksman at any rate.\"\r\n\r\nThey kept their position for some time, but saw nothing more of the\r\nIndian.\r\n\r\n\"He has left,\" said Elwood, \"and will give us a wide berth after this.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was rather curious that he should expose himself in that manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly natural,\" replied Elwood. \"He knew there was no danger until\r\n_I_ took the gun; then he thought it best for him to clear out.\"\r\n\r\n\"He may turn up again when we least expect it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do yees understand the maning of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not precisely; do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a lover of the fair female that ye gave the watch to for the\r\nblanket, and he had been watchin' us till he sane me, and then he got so\r\njailous of me that he has tried to put me out of the way.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys laughed at this explanation, which Tim gave with every\r\nappearance of earnestness, and were rather doubtful about believing it.\r\n\r\nThere was some fear expressed that this Indian might send them a bullet\r\nfrom some covert, when he could make his aim sure and shelter himself\r\nfrom all danger of a return fire; although as regards that the specimen\r\nhe had been given of the skill of the whites should have convinced him\r\nthat there was no need of his being particularly alarmed on this point.\r\n\r\nOur friends were sufficiently rested, and the associations of the place\r\nwere such that they resumed their journey at once toward the Salinas\r\nriver. They had gone but a short distance when Howard exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Halloo! yonder goes that Indian!\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed in the direction of the river fully a mile away, and looking\r\nthere they saw very near the center of the stream a small Indian canoe,\r\npropelled by a single occupant. The distance was so great that they\r\ncould decide nothing regarding his dress and appearance, and for a time\r\nit was doubtful whether there were one or two in the boat. They were\r\nsure, however, that it was the same personage that had so startled them,\r\nand that he was returning to his home.\r\n\r\n\"That looks as though he did not belong to these parts,\" said Elwood,\r\n\"and seems to throw doubt on his being the young squaw's lover.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it's a qua'r lover the same would be if he wouldn't go five hundred\r\nmiles for the smile of his beloved. Begorrah! but it was meself that\r\nused to walk five miles and back agin ivery Sunday night in Tipperary to\r\nsee Bridget Ann Mulloney, and then lost her after all when I'd spent\r\nalmost half a pound on her.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's another thing I'd like to buy, beside our rifles,\" said Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"A canoe. See how smoothly the savage floats down the river. The current\r\nis quite rapid, and it would take very little labor for us to make much\r\nbetter headway than we now do.'\"\r\n\r\n\"But we do not know how to paddle one of those frail concerns.\"\r\n\r\n\"We could learn soon enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"We may find one of them along the shore, as there seem to be plenty of\r\nIndians hereabouts, and I suppose every one of them is the proprietor of\r\none of these establishments.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't likely if yees finds one ye'll find the owner,\" said Tim, \"and\r\nI s'pose your conscience wouldn't let you take it unless you made a fair\r\nbargain with the owner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" laughed Howard, \"but what under the circumstances we\r\ncould persuade ourselves to take it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few hours they found themselves in the vicinity of\r\nthe Salinas River, and turned to the left so as to follow its windings\r\nas nearly as possible to the mouth, where they hoped to secure safer and\r\nspeedier transportation to their homes.\r\n\r\nAt night when they encamped the soft murmur of the river was in their\r\nears, and the cool, dry wind fanned them quietly as they sat down near a\r\ncluster of thick cottonwood to smoke their pipe, chat and prepare for\r\nthe night's rest. They made a good meal from their mountain sheep, and\r\ngorging Terror, threw the rest away as they deemed it hardly fit for\r\nfurther use.\r\n\r\nIt was quite late when they camped. Tim would have nothing to do with\r\nthe blanket, so the boys spread it upon the earth, lay down upon it, and\r\nthen drew the borders over them.\r\n\r\nWearied out they soon fell asleep, depending, under the kindness of\r\nheaven, upon the watchfulness of the faithful Newfoundland that had\r\nnever yet proved unfaithful to his trust.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the night Elwood awoke from a feeling of uncomfortable\r\nwarmth, and threw the blanket off and slept thus until morning. He was\r\nthe first to awake, just as light was dawning, and was on the point of\r\nrising when he started and became suddenly transfixed with horror at a\r\nsight directly before his eyes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE CROTALUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several species of rattlesnakes found in California, among\r\nwhich are the black, spotted and striped. Some of them grow to an\r\nenormous size and are anything but pleasant strangers to encounter,\r\nespecially when you come upon them suddenly and find them coiled. It is\r\na peculiarity of these specimens of the _Crotalus_ of America that they\r\nstrike only from the coil, are easily killed, and generally, although\r\n_not always_, do they rattle before they dart forward their poisonous\r\nfangs.\r\n\r\nWe can conceive of nothing upon the face of this beautiful earth more\r\nshudderingly repulsive than a rattlesnake. The arrowy head, and shiny,\r\nflabby body, with its glistening scales and variegated color, its\r\ntapering tail, with that dreadful arrangement by which it imitates so\r\nclosely the _whirr_ of the locust, the bead-like eyes, with no lids and\r\na fleshy film dropping over them--all these make up the most terrible\r\nreptile found on the American continent.\r\n\r\nAnd then imagine one of these creatures _coiled_! The thick, heavy body\r\nwith the tail projecting upward from the center, the head drawn back,\r\nand the red, cavernous mouth open, with the curved, hollow teeth and the\r\nsacs at their roots filled nigh to bursting with this concentrated\r\nessence of the vilest of all poison--imagine this, we say--but don't do\r\nit either! If you have never seen a rattlesnake, don't go near one,\r\nunless you have a chance to kill it, even if his fangs have been\r\nextracted. The heel shall bruise the serpent, and that is the best use\r\nto which they can be put.\r\n\r\nBut as Howard Lawrence opened his eyes, in the dull light of this summer\r\nmorning, he saw coiled within five feet of him a striped rattlesnake,\r\nits intensely black eyes fairly scintillating light, and its rattle\r\ngently waving but making no noise.\r\n\r\nIn a single second his true peril flashed upon him. If he moved the\r\nreptile would strike. He might throw himself suddenly backward, but in\r\nthat case if he escaped, the malignant fangs would be buried in the\r\nsleeping Elwood ere he could open his eyes and understand the danger\r\nthat threatened him. And he was afraid, too, to speak to him and Tim in\r\nthe hope of awaking them. There would be blundering upon their part, and\r\nblundering meant but one thing--death.\r\n\r\nHoward looked straight at the serpent's eyes and became conscious of a\r\nstrange sensation passing through him. The small, black orbs seemed to\r\nadvance, shrink and float away through the air, enchaining his own\r\nvision until the will, which had so vehemently repelled the danger grew\r\nindifferent, and the thought of peril merged into a vague, dreamy\r\nsemi-consciousness, which, while it took knowledge of the terrible\r\nreptile, coiled and ready to strike, yet failed to impress the mind with\r\nthe energy to withdraw from its terrible power. His blood slowly\r\nchilled, as if vein by vein it froze throughout his person, until from\r\nhead to foot the vital current was congealed. At times he strove to\r\nmove, or more properly sought, in the mysterious make-up of our\r\ncomposition, to rouse the will from its torpor, but with the same result\r\nas follows the effort of the sufferer to use his paralyzed limb. The\r\nwill seemed to make a feeble twitch or two and then subside, unable to\r\nbreak the fatal spell spreading over his mind and faculties. The eyes of\r\nthe reptile glared upon his own, their bead-like blackness taking the\r\nform of a point of fire waving, floating, gyrating and circling in the\r\nair, doubling in and out in rings of the rainbow's hues, melting away\r\ninto the distance, then drifting forward until mingled with his own, up\r\nand down in the same bewildering maze of color and design that visits\r\nthe patient when lost in the delirium of fever. And all the time it was\r\nas if the rattlesnake was conscious of the dreadful power he held over\r\nhis victim. Its arrowy head and long neck were started silently toward\r\nhim, as if threatening instant destruction; and then, like the cat\r\ntoying with her victim, it was withdrawn again, and the spell deepened\r\nand increased. A strange whirl passed through the mind of the boy. By a\r\nviolent attempt to call in his wandering thoughts he gathered an idea of\r\nthe mortal danger impending over him, but he could not centralize his\r\nmental powers.\r\n\r\nThe bewildering sensations were somewhat similar to that of a man whose\r\nbrain has received a violent concussion--the mysterious chambers and\r\nchannels through which thought forced its way were choked up and the\r\nsubtle impetus recoiled, powerless to perform its function. He felt the\r\nnecessity of clear, vigorous thought, but his dull brain would not\r\nwork--the cold incubus upon it chilled it through and through; and all\r\nthe time the malignantly beautiful reptile was partly coiling and\r\nuncoiling, the articulated ring giving a faint rattle, as if caused by\r\nthe slight vibration of its body. After a while the serpent lay still,\r\nbut never once was its eye removed from its victim. It was growing tired\r\nof dallying with its prey and was making ready to strike. The coil\r\nbecame close and compact, the rattle rising from the center, and the eye\r\nassumed a clear, metallic sharpness that appeared to throw forward its\r\nfateful rays into his own. He saw that the sport was done and the snake\r\nwas ready to strike; he strove to move, but could not; he essayed to\r\nspeak, but the words choked him unuttered. He saw the reptile calling in\r\nits strength and----\r\n\r\n_\"Quick, Howard, draw the blanket over you! He can't strike through\r\nthat!\"_\r\n\r\nThe practical, energetic words of Elwood Brandon, whom he had imagined\r\nasleep at his side, broke the dreadful spell that had enchained Howard.\r\nHe felt the mist pass from his eyes, his mind threw off the incubus\r\nwhich had borne it down, and he was himself again, with clear mental\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nHis right hand lay upon the thick blanket, and sensible of his extreme\r\nperil, he quickly closed it, grasping the edge firmly, and then threw\r\nhimself over upon his face and against his cousin, but covering both\r\ntheir bodies at the same instant with the heavy, closely-knit cloth.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment of doing so the angry locust-like ring of the reptile\r\nand a sharp thrust against the blanket as if struck by a small stick\r\nannounced that it has given its blow.\r\n\r\nHoward and Elwood both shouted to Tim to come to their assistance; but\r\nere he could respond a rush was heard, followed by a fierce growl, and\r\nthey understood at once that Terror had appeared upon the scene.\r\n\r\nThey let him rage for a few moments and then, Tim having informed them\r\nthat the snake was \"kilt entirely,\" they cautiously crept forth. As they\r\nlooked furtively around they saw at once that the Newfoundland had done\r\nhis work well. The reptile was torn into shreds and strewn over an area\r\nof several yards. Its fangs had entered the blanket where, while they\r\ndid not pierce through they stuck irrevocably, holding the reptile a\r\nprisoner to the fury of the dog.\r\n\r\nThankful indeed were the boys for their providential escape from this\r\ndreaded creature. Elwood had been awakened by its slight rattling, when,\r\nsuspecting the danger that was closing around his cousin, he uttered the\r\nwarning words which we have given and which proved the means of robbing\r\nthe blow of the reptile of its danger.\r\n\r\nThe fangs were carefully extracted from the blanket, and Howard declared\r\nhis intention of preserving them as a curiosity; but within a half-hour\r\nafter leaving the camp they were lost, and he did not judge it worth\r\nwhile to search for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE CAMP-FIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs our three friends on that bright summer morning stood on the slope of\r\nthe mountains and gazed down into the beautiful Salinas Valley before\r\nthem, Elwood Brandon suddenly pointed a little to the north and said:\r\n\r\n\"See! there are others beside us!\"\r\n\r\nAbout a mile distant, and not far from the river, they saw a thin, black\r\ncolumn of smoke rising among the trees, of so dark and palpable a\r\ncharacter that it could be distinguished at once.\r\n\r\n\"Another party of Indians,\" replied Howard. \"We seem to be getting into\r\ntheir neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only wish they were a party of white hunters or miners, for I long to\r\nsee a friendly face.\"\r\n\r\n\"What good could it do us? They wouldn't accompany us home, or take any\r\ntrouble to see that we were protected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not, but I tell you, Howard, this begins to look dangerous when\r\nwe see nothing but enemies. There are but three of us, and one gun only\r\nbetween us. I believe a single Indian could destroy us all if he chose\r\nto do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except in one contingency.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"That you should aim the gun. He would then flee at once.\"\r\n\r\nElwood laughed and added:\r\n\r\n\"But we have no breakfast, and we may as well be moving.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a sensible boy,\" added Tim O'Rooney, \"be the towken that when ye\r\nspakes ye quiverally anticipates me own thoughts.\"\r\n\r\nThey soon reached the level of the valley, and then took a direction\r\nstraight toward the spot where they had seen the camp-fire burning. The\r\nintervening space was quite thickly grown with trees and vegetation, so\r\nthat they could obtain no sight of the fire itself until they were very\r\nclose to it.\r\n\r\n\"We must be careful,\" admonished Howard. \"If it is a party of Indians\r\nthey may discover us before we do them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose it will do for us all to walk straight up to them, for\r\nthey'll be sure to see us then.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, one must creep up and find whether the coast is clear. Tim has seen\r\nmore of California than we have, and he can do that if he wishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sinsible agin, for I was about to spake the same. Do yees tarry here\r\nwhile I takes a look around. Whist! now, and kaap so still that ye'll\r\nhear me brathe all the way there and back agin.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys took their position each behind a large tree, and looking\r\ncautiously forth they awaited the return of their friend.\r\n\r\nWhen these precautions were taken they were not a hundred yards distant\r\nfrom the strangers. The Irishman stepped very carefully, moving on\r\ntiptoe, and not making any noise that was perceptible. This was no great\r\nattainment in woodcraft, as any person could have done the same with\r\nordinary care, when the woods were of the character of this one. Had\r\nthere been briers or brambles, or swampy ground, or that which was\r\nunusually dry, and covered with twigs, it would have been a feat far\r\nmore difficult of attainment.\r\n\r\nJust before Tim disappeared from view they saw him sink down upon his\r\nhands and knees and creep forward; but the bushes soon shut him out from\r\nview and they could only wait with all the patience possible.\r\n\r\nAt the end of about ten minutes the genial face of the Irishman\r\nappeared, and the expression upon it gave rise to pleasant\r\nanticipations.\r\n\r\n\"Who are they?\" asked the two boys together, as soon as they deemed it\r\nprudent.\r\n\r\n\"Whist! now don't spake so loud. Ye'll wake 'em out.\"\r\n\r\nTim looked behind, and became satisfied that there was no fear of\r\ndiscovery, when he arose to his feet, and took his careless, sauntering\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Tim!'\" said Howard inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"What is it yez wishes?\"\r\n\r\n\"We wish to know whether these strangers are white men or Indians.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, ye saas, I had to crawl up to 'em mighty careful, for if you step\r\nupon a stick no bigger than a tooth-pick, yees are sortin to wake up a\r\nslaapin' copper-skin----\"\r\n\r\n\"So they were Indians, then,\" interrupted Elwood somewhat impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Do yes be aisy now, and not be interruptin' of me, and yer observations\r\nand questions which ain't naaded in this case. Me owld grandfather used\r\nto till a great many stories to us spalpaans about the part he took with\r\nyoung Emmett--when owld Ireland stood up against England. He used to\r\ntell us his stories--did the same--and just so sure as one of us axed\r\nhim a question, he'd go back to the beginning and till the whole story\r\nover again. He'd begin airly in the evening, and kaap it going till tin\r\nor eleven o'clock. I belave the old gintleman rather liked to have us be\r\ninterruptin' him, for he laid bates for us wee ones, and ye see by that\r\nmanes one story sometimes kept him going for a waak. Heaven bliss the\r\nowld gintleman--he had a habit of stopping in the middle of an exciting\r\npart and lighting his dudheen, and then when he'd begin again, he'd skip\r\nover a part on purpose to make us ax him a question----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Tim, we will talk about your grandfather some other day,\" said\r\nHoward, who, as naturally may be supposed, was impatient for him to come\r\nto the point.\r\n\r\n\"Yis, I was just through with him, but yees should never be overmuch in\r\nhaste. Me blessed mother always told me that it was the same as being\r\ntoo slow, and if anybody could spake of the same, could me mother do it.\r\nI was about to obsarve when yees interrupted me, that a man must be\r\nmighty careful in going up to a camp-fire, for these Indians slaap so\r\nquietly that the overturning of a leaf is sure to wake 'em, and you saa\r\nby this, if we'd all three gone up, as we war thinkin' about, they'd\r\nheard us long before we could have got sight of 'em, and our tramping in\r\nCaliforny would be done with----\"\r\n\r\n\"So they were Indians were they?\" asked Elwood again, partly amused and\r\npartly vexed at Tim's persistent dallying with their curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"Who said the same?\"\r\n\r\n\"You implied it. Were they red or white men? Answer us--yes or no!\"\r\n\r\n\"And that is just the pint I's raching for, as me frind, Michael\r\nO'Shanghangly, said when he took a half-quart of whisky. Yez understands\r\nthat I wanted to make sure just who the same might be, and what was\r\ntheir number. 'Spose, now, I should have come back and said there war\r\nbut three of the same, and there should be a half-dozen, or I should say\r\nthey was white gintlemen like ourselves, and they should turn out to be\r\nof a darker hue. Ye saas that it wouldn't do.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys had become so uneasy by this time that they were walking back\r\nand forth, and talking to each other in low tones.\r\n\r\n\"I will go forward and see for myself,\" said Elwood. \"I don't care about\r\nwaiting an hour or two for him to answer my question.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will soon answer us; he is only indulging in a little pleasantry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather a bad time for jesting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we can be sure of one thing,\" added Howard a moment later.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"That we are not in much danger. If we were he wouldn't wait so long to\r\ntell us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know about that; it would be in keeping with his foolishness. I\r\ntell you, Howard, I will ask him once more, and if he doesn't answer me\r\nat once, I shall go forward and learn for myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tim, are those Indians or white men?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it, is it? Why didn't yez ax me before? They're a party of white\r\nmen, be the same!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE MINERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I wished to give yez a pleasant surprise, as the doctor said when he\r\ntold the man that his wife was dead,\" remarked Tim, in explanation of\r\nhis conduct. \"Had there really been any of the red gintlemen around I'd\r\nhave told you soon enough.\"\r\n\r\nOur young friends were too well pleased at the intelligence to feel\r\nother than good natured, and they gladly forgave Tim for his trespass\r\nupon their patience. Without waiting further they walked hastily\r\nforward, and a moment later stood by the camp-fire.\r\n\r\nThree men, apparently, had just aroused themselves from slumber, and\r\nwere now stirring around making preparations for their breakfast. They\r\nwere shaggy, unshorn, grimy-looking fellows, who had \"run wild\" for\r\nseveral years, but who had not necessarily lost their humanity, even\r\nthough they had in a great degree lost its outward semblance. In the\r\ncenter, a large bundle of sticks were burning quite briskly, and one of\r\nthe men was turning and watching some meat that was cooking over it. The\r\nothers had evidently just returned from the river, for their red temples\r\nand foreheads still glistened with moisture which sparkled like dew on\r\ntheir patriarchal beards.\r\n\r\nThey were rough, hardy-looking fellows, but Elwood felt little\r\napprehension as he stepped forward and said:\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, gentlemen!\"\r\n\r\nHe who was cook turned his head, but a hot drop of moisture from the\r\nsteaming meat at that moment flew in his eye, and clapping his finger to\r\nit, he muttered something, and forthwith and instantly gave his\r\nexclusive attention to his culinary duties.\r\n\r\nThe second man was rubbing his face with a piece of coarse cloth, and he\r\nsuddenly paused with his black eyes glaring over the top, his face\r\nresembling the head of some huge animal clambering over the edge of a\r\nrock, and who, having just gained a foothold, is looking hurriedly\r\naround for his prey.\r\n\r\nThe third was combing his hair, and just at this moment it was moistened\r\nand sticking straight over his forehead like the horn of an animal. He\r\nwould run the comb through with his right hand and then smooth the hair\r\nwith his left. He stopped with both arms crooked over his head, and\r\nwheeled around like an automaton, and stared at the boy a moment, and\r\nthen said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, there! Why didn't you ring the door-bell? I say, youngster, come\r\nforward and give us a grip of your hand. Halloo! you've got your brother\r\nwith you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not my brother, but my cousin, Howard Lawrence.\"\r\n\r\nThe two boys shook hands with the three, and the grip that they received\r\nfrom the horny palms made them wince with pain.\r\n\r\n\"But where'd you come from? We don't see a couple of youngsters dressed\r\nup in your style promenading 'round in these parts every day. Where'd\r\nyou come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"The steamer on which we took passage the other day from Panama, was\r\nburned off the coast, and we got ashore on a raft.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be you the only ones?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; there were quite a number that escaped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where be they?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were carried away by a vessel while we had wandered inland.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you two--halloo! here's your grandfather!\"\r\n\r\n\"No; that is Tim O'Rooney, a good friend of ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your humble sarvint!\" saluted the Irishman, removing his hat, making a\r\nprofound bow and scraping a large foot upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there! We're glad to see you. What's all your names?\"\r\n\r\nThey were given several times, and then carefully spelled at the request\r\nof the large-whiskered man, who desired that no mistake might be made.\r\n\r\n\"You may call me Ned Trimble, and that ugly-looking fellow 'tending to\r\nthe fire is George Wakeman, and that horrid-looking chap scrubbing off\r\nhis dirty face, is Alfred Wilkins. Neither of them know much, and I\r\nbrought them along to black my boots and dress my hair.\"\r\n\r\nIt looked as though Ned was a sort of a wag, for his companions smiled\r\nas if they were used to that thing. He continued:\r\n\r\n\"We're a party of hunters that have been in Californy for the last five\r\nyears, and I rather guess I've prospected through every part of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must be rich by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rich!\" laughed Ned Trimble. \"Well there, we're everything but rich.\r\nSomehow or other we hain't had the luck. We sold a claim up in the\r\ndiggings for five hundred dollars, and the next week the party sold it\r\nfor fifteen thousand. That's the way it has always gone with us; but we\r\nare going to be rich yet--ain't we, boys.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if we only live long enough,\" replied Wakeman.\r\n\r\n\"I told you that chap hadn't much sense,\" remarked Ned, addressing his\r\nthree visitors. \"He doesn't know enough to answer a question as he\r\noughter. I've been trying to teach him something, but I shall have to\r\ngive it up as a bad job. Been to breakfast?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--not yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thought you hadn't. Cook, put up another slice, douse it in butter,\r\nsalt and pepper, and serve it up as you used to do when I employed you\r\nat the Astor. Gentlemen, how do you like it, rare or well done?\"\r\n\r\nAll made answer that they were not particular, and Ned replied thereunto\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"Sensible fellows! If you don't care what you get, you won't have to\r\ncare much for what you don't get. What will you select as a dessert?\r\nPlum, rice, bread, or cherry pudding? Apple, mince, cranberry, plum,\r\npeach, or lemon pie? Cup-custard, tapioca, watermelon, citron, or\r\nsherry, maderia, or port. Order which ever you choose, gentlemen, it\r\ndon't make any difference to us. We can give you one just as well as the\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you can,\" laughed Howard; \"so we'll not take the trouble to\r\norder any.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right; as you please, gentlemen. We haven't any turkey or oysters\r\nleft so you will have to put up with a little antelope that we shot\r\nyesterday afternoon. Fine condition for this time of year, and the best\r\nkind of flesh to starve to death on.\"\r\n\r\n\"We haven't had a taste of it yet; but we devoured a goodly piece of a\r\nmountain sheep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so. I was going to speak of a mountain sheep, if my servants\r\nhadn't interrupted me so often with inquiries as to how they should make\r\nthe wine sauce. Ah! I see our meal is ready; we will therefore repair to\r\nthe banquet hall.\"\r\n\r\nThe six took their seats upon the leaves, and ate the meal in the usual\r\nprimitive manner, verifying the adage, \"hunger is the best sauce.\"\r\n\r\nNed Trimble enlivened the meal in his usual loquacious manner; and after\r\na great many words and circumlocution, the fact was discovered that he\r\nand his friends had spent the last five years in California, not having\r\nvisited a civilized post within two years.\r\n\r\nDisgusted with their ill success in the Sacramento Valley, they had\r\npulled up stakes and started off to hunt new fields for themselves. They\r\nwere very cheerful and hopeful, and according to their accounts had\r\nencountered every imaginable danger of the California wilds.\r\n\r\nElwood inquired whether they had met any grizzly bears.\r\n\r\n\"Grizzly bears!\" repeated Ned, stopping just as he was about to insert a\r\nhuge piece of meat in his mouth. \"Grizzly bears? Well, there! _We've\r\nlived among 'em!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I tracked a big grizzly in the Sierra Nevada for two days and then\r\nI stopped.\"\r\n\r\n\"What made you stop?\"\r\n\r\n_\"I concluded the bear tracks were getting a little too fresh!\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nA WANT SUPPLIED.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing attracted the notice and pleased our friends, and gave them a\r\nhope of being able to supply a want they had felt every moment since\r\nlanding upon the California coast. Each of the miners had two rifles,\r\nand were abundantly supplied with ammunition and mining tools. The\r\nwonder was how they could carry so heavy a load for such a distance. It\r\ncould not be understood until Ned Trimble stated that they had two good,\r\ntough mules pasturing in a secluded place about a half-mile distant.\r\n\r\n\"That 'ere Injin blanket you're carryin' is rather pretty!\" remarked Ned\r\nas he rubbed his greasy fingers through his hair.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we got it of an Indian girl, and take great pride in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did, eh? What did you give her for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A gold watch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Well, if the watch was a first-rate one maybe she got her pay; but\r\nwhat did she want with a watch? That's just the way with all women.\r\nThey'll give ten times the value for some little gewgaw to wear about\r\n'em. I was engaged to a fine-looking girl in North Carolina, but I seen\r\nshe was getting so extravagant that I couldn't understand it, so I left\r\nbefore it was too late.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very wise plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she was very extravagant.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what respect?\" asked Elwood, who was quite amused at their\r\nnewly-found friend.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, she would persist in wearing shoes on Sunday instead of\r\ngoing barefoot like the rest of the young ladies. I warned her two or\r\nthree times, but I catched her at church one day with them on, and so I\r\nwent over to the house that night and told her I couldn't trust her any\r\nlonger, and we exchanged presents and parted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exchanged presents?\" laughed Wakeman. \"What sort of presents were\r\nthey?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish no trifling insinuations, sir,\" replied Ned, with a\r\ngrandiloquent air. \"She returned to me a tooth brush that I had\r\npresented her some months before, and I gave back to her a tin button\r\nthat she had bought of a traveling peddler, and that I had been wearing\r\non Sundays for my breastpin. 'Tis not the intrinsic worth you know, but\r\nthe associations connected with such things that makes 'em dear. But it\r\nis a painful subject, gentlemen, and let us, therefore, dismiss it.\"\r\n\r\nHoward and Lawrence thought it best to introduce the matter upon which\r\nthey had been so long meditating.\r\n\r\n\"I notice that each of you have two guns apiece. Did you leave San\r\nFrancisco with that supply?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; we've got 'em of the redskins we've run agin on the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you be willing to sell us a couple? You observe we have but one\r\nbetween us, and it makes it rather dangerous, as none of us are very\r\nskillful in the use of the rifle.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't take the trouble to tell us that,\" replied Ned, with a\r\nquizzical look. \"I'd like to accommodate you, but we had begun to think\r\nthat we needed three or four guns apiece; for, you see, we intend to\r\nstay in these parts some time, and we are sure to have trouble with the\r\nredskins.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you really wish them,\" remarked Elwood, \"of course we cannot ask you\r\nto part with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What'll you give?\" abruptly asked Ned.\r\n\r\n\"What will you take?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't sell you both of mine, as I wouldn't have one; but, Wakeman,\r\nif I part with one of mine will you do the same?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; for I know they'll need the arms before they get back to San\r\nFrancisco.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the question is, what will you ask us for the two guns?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you give us a hundred dollars?\"\r\n\r\n\"Apiece?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no; for both of 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; we will gladly do that.\"\r\n\r\nNow came the crisis. The party had not a dozen dollars among them.\r\nHoward and Elwood had left their money in the berth of the steamer, and\r\nof course it was irrevocably gone. But Elwood's watch remained, and that\r\nat the least calculation was worth one hundred and fifty; but whether\r\nthe miners would accept it at a fair valuation for their pieces, was in\r\ntheir minds very doubtful.\r\n\r\n\"We have no money,\" said Howard, \"but my cousin has a watch that is\r\nworth more than that sum, which he will give you for the two guns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's see it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was produced and passed around the company. Ned opened and shut it,\r\nand shook it and placed it to his ear.\r\n\r\n\"It ain't running,\" he suddenly said.\r\n\r\n\"No; the salt water has stopped it, but I do not think it is really\r\ninjured. A little cleaning will speedily set it going.\"\r\n\r\nNed passed the time-piece back again.\r\n\r\n\"Don't want it; it won't do us no good.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are hunting for gold, and there is enough in it to make it\r\nworth your while to take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We expect to find all the gold we can carry back with us without\r\nloading our mules down with gold watches.\"\r\n\r\nElwood replaced the watch in his pocket, disheartened at the failure of\r\nhis offer.\r\n\r\n\"We have no money; if you will call at my father's the next time you go\r\nto San Francisco, he will gladly give you your price.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know as we shall go to San Francisco for the next five years;\r\nshan't go any way until we are loaded down with gold, and then we won't\r\ncare about calling on your father--more likely he'll want to call on\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nAn idea struck Howard.\r\n\r\n\"You are pleased with our blanket. Will you exchange your guns for\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\nNed shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Got all the blankets we want; don't want it; keep it yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you not give us one gun for both the blanket and watch?\"\r\n\r\nThe miner now laughed, and shook his head again.\r\n\r\n\"Don't want either; can't do it.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys now despaired.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we may as well give up. We can't get any guns of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the reason you can't?\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem unwilling to trade, and we can not buy them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you can't; but----\"\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon the miner rose to his feet and handed one gun to Elwood\r\nand the other to Howard.\r\n\r\n\"What does this mean?\" asked the latter, not comprehending him.\r\n\r\n\"You don't suppose we would be _mean_ enough to _sell_ you anything you\r\nneeded so bad, do you? No; take them both, and here's a lot of lead,\r\ngun-caps and ammunition.\"\r\n\r\n\"But----\"\r\n\r\n\"No _buts_ about it. Take 'em, you're welcome, for you need 'em. I was\r\nonly joking with you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE CANOE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNed Trimble would not hear the repeated thanks of our friends, but waved\r\nthem an impressive and magnificent farewell as they took their\r\ndeparture. They were not yet beyond sight of each other when they heard\r\nhim calling to them in excited tones, and the next moment he came\r\nrunning after them.\r\n\r\n\"I think you said you was going to undertake to foller the river down\r\nthe valley, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\nThey made answer that such was their intention, whereupon he hastened to\r\nadd:\r\n\r\n\"About a mile down, under some bushes that stick out by a big rock, on\r\nthe same side that you're traveling, is a little Injin canoe that is\r\njust the thing you want. You're welcome to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how shall we thank you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know; again, my noble friends, I bid thee farewell, and if\r\nforever, still forever, fare thee well.\"\r\n\r\nThe eccentric miner lifted his hat, bowed very low, and sauntered back\r\nto his friends with the air of a monarch who had just indulged in some\r\ngracious act of condescension, while our friends, delighted beyond\r\nmeasure, hurried forward on their journey.\r\n\r\nThey were now amply provided--each having a gun and plenty of\r\nammunition, and their faithful dog. They began to look upon themselves\r\nas on a holiday excursion. The only thing was, that there was rather too\r\nstrong a tinge of danger about it. If they were but a hundred or two\r\nmiles nearer home, and their parents had no anxiety regarding them, it\r\nwould be more pleasant. But then, they could easily understand how much\r\nworse it easily could be, and they were heartfelt at the good fortune\r\nwhich had followed them thus far on their strange entry into California.\r\nThe most that they could ask was that it might continue.\r\n\r\nElwood and Howard were anxious to test their marksmanship, but prudence\r\nforbade it, as the chances were that they would need all their\r\nammunition, and the report of their guns might draw inconvenient\r\nattention to themselves.\r\n\r\nThey were walking cheerily along when a singular object caught their\r\neyes. At first sight it resembled an Indian hut; but it was much too\r\nsmall to be inhabited by a human being, and therefore must have been the\r\nhandiwork of some animal.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we batter it down?\" asked Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"No; we do not know what is in it, and there is no use of wantonly\r\ndestroying the home of any dumb creature.\"\r\n\r\n\"It reminds me of me birthplace in ould Ireland,\" said Tim, with a sigh.\r\n\r\nBut Terror was not so considerate as his masters; for bursting forward\r\nhe placed his snout at the lower orifice, snuffed furiously, and then\r\nclawed so savagely that the greater part of the singular fabric came\r\ntumbling to the ground. It was made of brush and twigs, and like\r\neverything constructed by instinct, was put together with great skill.\r\nTerror could not be restrained until he had inflicted great injury.\r\n\r\n\"Look! what are they?\" exclaimed Howard in astonishment. \"What\r\nstrange-looking creatures!\"\r\n\r\n\"Snapping tortles!\" replied Tim, staring with an expression of the\r\ngreatest astonishment at the objects.\r\n\r\nThree animals, about the size of a musk-rat, with webbed feet, and the\r\ncolor of mice, came scrambling forth and scampered away for the shelter\r\nof the rocks.\r\n\r\nTerror by this time had been brought under restraint, and was prevented\r\nfrom crushing them to death as they ran.\r\n\r\nGreat speculation was caused by their appearance, as none of our friends\r\nhad seen anything like them, nor had they ever heard or read of such.\r\nThey were, in fact, a species of mountain rat living in the vicinity of\r\nmountains and constructing their singular-looking huts with remarkable\r\nskill, often building them to a height of six feet. Their fur is very\r\nfine, and the hunters and trappers frequently take the animals for their\r\ncoats, although their diminutive size, when compared with the beaver,\r\notter, and other fur-bearing animals, prevents their being much in\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nThe hunters, as perhaps it is proper to term them, were too anxious to\r\ndiscover the canoe to pause long at any curiosity unless it was\r\nsomething extraordinary. They carefully noted the distance they\r\njourneyed, and when they judged they had gone about a mile, stepped into\r\nthe edge of the river and looked about them. But they saw nothing\r\nanswering to Ned Trimble's description of the hiding-place of the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he was jesting,\" remarked Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"No; I think he is too kind-hearted for that. He may have been mistaken\r\nas to whether it is precisely a mile or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whist! but it strikes me that the bushes are rather thick just ayonst\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nTim pointed to a spot a hundred rods away which had failed to arrest\r\ntheir attention. There was nothing unusual, except mayhap that the\r\noverhanging shrubbery was rather denser than usual; but it held out\r\nhope, and the party hurried pell-mell to the spot.\r\n\r\nThere, sure enough, they descried the rock, and lifting the bushes,\r\ncaught sight of the small, delicate canoe concealed beneath. Elwood was\r\nin the advance, and quickly pulled it forth with the wildest expressions\r\nof delight.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it splendid!\" he fairly shouted. \"And here is a long paddle. Our\r\nwork is now done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do yees jist stand up in the same,\" said Tim, \"and see what a beautiful\r\nrest it gives to the faat.\"\r\n\r\nThe impulsive boy caught up the paddle, and rose to his feet; but it was\r\nlike unto him who first puts on skates. It flashed from beneath him, and\r\nhe was precipitated headlong into the water. The others, as a matter of\r\ncourse, laughed.\r\n\r\n\"That was done on purpose,\" said Elwood as he clambered to his feet\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"I wished to give yees a little insthruction, and that was me first\r\nlesson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I learned considerable at any rate.\"\r\n\r\nThe canoe was caught, and the three carefully entered and seated\r\nthemselves. It was made of bark, bound together with cord and gum, and\r\nwould have held double their weight, being very light and buoyant.\r\n\r\nA vast amount of sport was afforded the party in learning to navigate\r\nthe frail vessel. Tim had had some experience in the matter, and could\r\npropel it quite dexterously; but the boys were much at fault: they\r\nexpended far more strength than there was any need for, and soon\r\nexhausted themselves so thoroughly that they were obliged to relinquish\r\nthe sole management of the boat into the hands of Tim O'Rooney.\r\n\r\n\"There's a bootiful current here,\" said he, \"and we can have the\r\nillegant pleasure of moving along without working ourselves, as me\r\nfrind, Michael McGubbens, said when they carried him off to Botany Bay.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irishman first dipped his paddle upon the one side and then upon the\r\nother, and imparted quite a velocity to the canoe. The boys were so\r\npleased with the easy, gliding motion that they failed to notice the\r\nshores they were passing between. When finally Tim lay down his paddle\r\nand rested they were charmed.\r\n\r\nAll were tired enough to make them enjoy this relaxation and the\r\nsensation of floating so idly forward. The sky was clear and almost free\r\nof clouds, the dry air was not uncomfortably warm, and an occasional\r\nbreeze that came floating apparently from the snowy peaks of the Coast\r\nRange imparted delicious coolness. On the left stretched the high hills\r\nintervening between them and the Pacific, and on the right rose the vast\r\nCoast Mountains, forming in its extensive line some of the finest\r\nscenery on the North American Continent.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by, as they rounded a bend in the river, a small island appeared\r\nnear the center of the channel.\r\n\r\n\"There we will rest,\" said Howard.\r\n\r\nA half-hour later the canoe lightly touched the shore, and springing out\r\nthey pulled it up on the land after them. They had scarcely done so when\r\na groan very near them startled them all.\r\n\r\n\"Whisht!\" whispered Tim; \"there's somebody else beside us on this\r\nisland.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nSHASTA, THE PAH UTAH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll three paused and listened. For a moment all was still; and then the\r\nsuppressed groan of distress was heard, as though the sufferer were\r\nseeking to keep back the outcry that was forced from him.\r\n\r\n\"There it is!\" whispered Howard, pointing to a clump of bushes near the\r\nedge of the river.\r\n\r\n\"It strikes me we had better leave!\" replied Elwood, looking forward to\r\nthe canoe as if fearful that that would be taken from them and all\r\nescape be thus cut off.\r\n\r\n\"Do you sind the dog forward and let him smell out the difficulty,\"\r\nsuggested Tim O'Rooney.\r\n\r\nTerror stood there between the boys, his head raised and his whole\r\nappearance indicating that he had scented something unusual, but was\r\nawaiting orders before advancing upon it. The Newfoundland looked up as\r\nif asking for directions. Elwood simply pointed toward the brush and the\r\ndog galloped to it. Instead of entering, he stopped by it and gave a low\r\ngrowl of discovery.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Terror?\" asked Howard.\r\n\r\nThe brute whined and ran to his masters and then back to the bushes.\r\n\r\n\"It maybe a trap to catch us,\" said Elwood. \"I prefer very much taking\r\nto the canoe and getting away from the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it may be some one suffering and needing help. He may perish if we\r\nleave him here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yez spakes the truth,\" said Tim. \"The blessed Father would never\r\nforgive us if we should desart one of his creatures when he needed\r\nhilp.\"\r\n\r\nTim now advanced straight to the bushes, paused, and then parted them\r\nand looked in. He was heard to mutter something to himself; then he came\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"It's an Injin, a-layin' on the ground, a-groanin' and a-rollin' over. I\r\nguess the poor fellow has got his last sickness, and we can't help him\r\nany.\"\r\n\r\nAll feelings were at once merged into that of pity. The three advanced\r\nand parted the bushes. There, sure enough, lay an Indian apparently nigh\r\nunto death. He turned his black eyes up to the white people in a manner\r\nthat would have melted the heart of a Nero. He lay doubled up on his\r\nblanket, with his gun a short distance from him. He belonged to the Pah\r\nUtah tribe, although their hunting-grounds are further to the southwest.\r\nThis fact, as a matter of course, was unknown to our friends.\r\n\r\nThe first impression was that he had been badly wounded, but a second\r\nglance showed that he was deadly sick.\r\n\r\nElwood Brandon had placed his hand upon the dusky forehead, and the heat\r\nand throbbing temples told him at once that he was possessed with a\r\nburning fever.\r\n\r\nThe poor Indian muttered something unintelligible, but which bore some\r\nresemblance to the word \"Shasta,\" and he made a motion toward his mouth\r\nand then threw his head back and imitated the act of drinking.\r\n\r\n\"He must be suffering with thirst,\" said Howard. \"How shall we manage to\r\ngive him water?\"\r\n\r\n\"God save the poor fellow! I will soon fix that!\" exclaimed the\r\nkind-hearted Tim, rising to his feet and hurrying to the river's edge.\r\nHere he speedily constructed quite a capacious cup of leaves, and\r\ncarefully filling it with cool water he as carefully carried it back to\r\nwhere he lay.\r\n\r\n\"Now, me good felly, just tip up his noddle and we'll make him faal\r\naisy.\"\r\n\r\nElwood carefully raised his head, and the trembling sufferer eagerly\r\nreached forward for the cooling fluid. It was placed to his parched lips\r\nand swallowed hastily, when he immediately motioned for more.\r\n\r\n\"Will it do to give it?\" asked Howard. \"Will it not injure him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Niver a bit,\" replied Tim, hurrying away for another supply.\r\n\r\nIn a moment it was brought and swallowed with the same avidity. He then\r\nlay his head back upon the blanket of the boys, which had been folded\r\ninto a pillow by Howard. His great black eyes looked the thanks which\r\nhis tongue was unable to express.\r\n\r\n\"Now he will slaap,\" said Tim. \"Lave him alone.\"\r\n\r\nHe was relinquished to slumber while our friends retired a short\r\ndistance to consult.\r\n\r\n\"How providential that we landed here,\" said Howard. \"He was too feeble\r\nto help himself, and might have died in great distress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am glad that we found him, for if he does die we may be the\r\nmeans of robbing his last moments of great suffering.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boys,\" said Tim, hitching up his pantaloons and scratching his head,\r\n\"me mind is made up to one thing.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys looked inquiringly at him.\r\n\r\n\"I stays here till that poor copper-skin gets well or dies.\"\r\n\r\nThis decision pleased his companions, who declared their resolve of\r\ndoing all they could for the sufferer.\r\n\r\n\"How much more pleasant than shooting at him,\" said Elwood. \"I never\r\nfelt better in my life than when I found I was able to do something for\r\nthis Indian.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a happiness it is indeed to minister to the wants of the suffering\r\nand distressed! What purer joy than to wipe away the damp from the brow\r\nof the dying and to speak words of consolation in their ears? That last\r\nagony must come to us all sooner or later, and oh how deeply we shall\r\nthen appreciate the kindness of the friend who stands beside us,\r\nministering to our wants and doing all possible to cheer and soothe our\r\nsuffering! True, we must go alone through the Dark Valley, but others\r\nmay lead us down to the border, and their cheering words may yet linger\r\nwith us as the day closes and we step into that awful gloom through\r\nwhich we must pass before we can enter into the eternal day beyond.\r\nThough we know that He stands waiting to take our hand in His and lead\r\nus through the solemn darkness, yet the soul, hovering in its flight,\r\nlongs for the companionship of the dear ones, until the final adieu must\r\ncome! Oh, loving Father, whose sympathizing arms reach out to enfold us\r\nall, grant that such may be mine and the lot of all my friends.\r\n\r\nUpon looking at the Indian an hour later, he was seen to be sleeping as\r\ncalmly as an infant, while his face was covered with a mild, healthful\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\n\"He will git well!\" said Tim. \"Did I not stand by the bedside of my poor\r\nmother and give her the cowld water that brought her back to life agin?\"\r\n\r\n\"The crisis of the fever has passed, or is passing,\" said Howard. \"He\r\nmust have an iron constitution, like all his people, and he will rally,\r\nI have no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" added Elwood, with much feeling, \"there is one thing certain;\r\n_all_ are not our enemies; we have made one friend at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, an Indian never forgets an injury nor a kindness, and his\r\nfriendship may be of benefit to us before we reach home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I b'laves you, boys; that Injin will remember us as long as he lives,\r\nand will sarve us a good turn if the chances for the same be iver given\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"But see, he has awaked!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nA HUNT FOR FOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indian was awake and making signs to his friends. For some time they\r\nwere at a loss to understand their meaning, but Howard noticed that he\r\nhad a leaf in his hand which he offered to them. When the boy took it\r\nhis face showed that he was pleased, but continued his signs as before.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Elwood's eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n\"He wants us to bring him some of those leaves. Let me have it; they\r\nmust be on the island.\"\r\n\r\nHe hastened away and was not long in finding a bush that bore precisely\r\nthe same species, and gathering quite a lot he returned to the Indian\r\nand offered them to him. But he did not seem satisfied. He looked at the\r\nleaves, nodded his head, and then taking them by the slight twigs to\r\nwhich they were fastened, he made as if to pull them up again.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I know what he means!\" said Howard. \"It is not the leaf but the\r\nroot that he wishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can soon get that.\"\r\n\r\nElwood verified his words, and scarce ten minutes elapsed ere he\r\nreturned with several goodly-sized roots, which were washed and cleaned.\r\nThe look of the Indian showed that he had now got what he wanted, and he\r\nbegan gnawing the bark and chewing it.\r\n\r\n\"He's a docthering himself now!\" said Tim, \"as the patient said when he\r\ngave the docther his own medicine and pisened him to death by raisin of\r\nthe same. He will get along.\"\r\n\r\nThey watched the sufferer for a few moments. Gathering his mouth nearly\r\nfull of the bark, he continued chewing and swallowing for some time\r\nlonger, when he finally shut his eyes and again slept.\r\n\r\nPicking up a piece of the root which he had gathered Elwood tasted of\r\nit. He found it so bitter that he instantly spat it out.\r\n\r\n\"It must have some medicinal quality,\" remarked Howard, \"or he would not\r\nuse it. I believe the Indians doctor entirely with herbs, and I have no\r\ndoubt that he will soon be well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do yez mind that if it isn't noon it is close to the same? And be the\r\ntame towken we are all slightly hungry.\"\r\n\r\nNow arose a query. The island was so small that it contained no game of\r\nany kind, and so was unavailable to supply their wants. The river\r\nabounded in fish, but there was no means of catching them; and finally,\r\nafter some discussion, it was agreed that Tim should cross over to the\r\nmainland and shoot something.\r\n\r\n\"Do yez kaap your eyes about yez till I'z back again, for some of the\r\ncoppery gintlemen may take a notion to pay yez a visit.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys felt a little uneasiness as they saw their companion enter the\r\ncanoe and paddle toward the eastern shore--the shore which as yet had\r\nbeen unvisited by them. They watched until he landed, pulled the boat up\r\nbehind him into shelter, and then disappeared in the wood.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be in rather a bad situation if he never comes back,\" remarked\r\nElwood.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know about that; in what better occupation can we be found than\r\nin ministering to the wants of a suffering Indian? Would not that itself\r\nprotect us from injury?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it might; but what would become of us any way? They wouldn't be\r\nkind enough to guide us up to San Francisco.\"\r\n\r\n\"They might take us so far that we could find our way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly; I don't like to see Tim go to that shore; it looks too\r\ndangerous. I wonder why he did it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He must have believed there is more game there.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is enough on the other side, and he would avoid this greater\r\ndanger by going there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I imagine that a river running through a hostile country is as\r\ndangerous upon one side as upon the other, and there is little choice,\r\nHoward, in the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I know _you_ feel unpleasant in being thus left alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know I shall be glad to see Tim come back again, for there is always\r\ngreat danger in such a small party separating.\"\r\n\r\n\"Halloo! there goes his gun or somebody else's.\"\r\n\r\nThe sharp crack of the rifle came from the shore, and Elwood was sure he\r\nsaw the faint smoke of the discharge ascend from some thick bushes near\r\nthe edge of the wood. But he was no doubt mistaken, for as they\r\nscrutinized the spot they detected nothing of him who had fired the gun.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it was Tim firing at some game. You know he is not a very\r\ngood shot, and so he has badly wounded without killing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we ought to hear his gun again.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall no doubt----\"\r\n\r\n\"Hark!\"\r\n\r\nCrack went a gun, almost instantly followed by three similar reports.\r\nThe boys turned pale and looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\" whispered Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"That is bad; Tim is in trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"He ought to have had better sense than to paddle out there in open day,\r\nplunge right into the woods and go to shooting without stopping to see\r\nwhat the danger is. But what will become of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"And of us?\"\r\n\r\n\"This Indian here must have had some way of getting upon the island. I\r\nbelieve he has a canoe hid somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what of it? We cannot think of leaving until we know something\r\ndefinite about Tim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless some of the Indians start to come over to the island, and then\r\nwe'll leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that would be the wisest plan, Elwood? They can handle the\r\npaddle so much better than we that it would take but little time for\r\nthem to overhaul us. Then, too, if they should find us by this suffering\r\nbrother of theirs would it not make friends of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose this Indian here is one of their enemies?\"\r\n\r\nThis was a supposition that had never occurred to Howard before, but\r\nwhich he saw was very reasonable. All Indians not belonging to the same\r\ntribe might be supposed to be enemies of each other, and thus the mercy\r\nand kindness of our young heroes might be made the means of their\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think of that,\" said Howard, \"it may be so. But let us hope\r\nfor the best. Tim may soon return to us again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if he has a grain of sense left.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has been seen by Indians, and if they haven't got him now they will\r\nsoon have him if he undertakes to paddle his canoe over to the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Elwood; he will no doubt wait until it is dark, and then\r\ncome out to us as stealthily as he can.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is if he gets the chance. I tell you, Howard,\" said his cousin,\r\nstarting up, \"this begins to look bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it does.\"\r\n\r\n\"We know how those red men handle their guns, and it don't look likely\r\nto me that all those shots have missed Tim.\"\r\n\r\n\"They may be quite a distance apart--far enough to make their aim\r\nuncertain.\"\r\n\r\n\"But then they could cut off his return to the shore.\"\r\n\r\nHoward suddenly laid his hand upon the arm of his cousin and pointed to\r\nthe other shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nDANGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree Indians walked leisurely down to the shore of the river, as though\r\nin quest of nothing particular, and stood gesticulating as they\r\ngenerally do with their whole arms. They were about two hundred yards\r\nabove the point where Tim O'Rooney landed, but their position was such\r\nthat the canoe might have rested on the surface of the water without\r\nbeing seen. Sensible of their danger, the boys at first sight of them\r\nwithdrew into cover, from which they cautiously peered out and watched\r\ntheir movements.\r\n\r\n\"Those must be the three who fired the guns,\" whispered Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"Very probably they are; that looks more encouraging, for I do not see\r\nTim among them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe they have slain him and are talking as to where he came from.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven! I hope not.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I; but it looks reasonable that they have made away with him and\r\nare now looking for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did they know he had any friends with him? Then, too, if they had\r\nslain him, would they not have followed his trail straight down to the\r\nwater?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think of that. _That_ question makes me more hopeful than\r\nanything else. It does now look somewhat cheering. But what are they\r\nafter?\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians were still talking in an excited manner, and more than once\r\npointed across the river to the island as if there were something there\r\nwhich claimed their attention. It might be the boys themselves, or they\r\nmay have known that one of their race lay there in dire extremity; but\r\nwhatever the cause was it boded no good to the two boys, who were\r\ncrouching in the bushes and grass and furtively watching their motions.\r\n\r\nThe latter were still gazing at them when their hearts were thrilled by\r\nthe sight of Tim O'Rooney. The eyes of Elwood chanced to be fixed upon a\r\nsmall open space, a rod or two from where the canoe lay, when he saw the\r\nIrishman come cautiously into view, and then pause and look around him.\r\nHe had an animal slung over his shoulders, whose weight was sufficient\r\nto make him stop and travel with some difficulty. They saw him turn his\r\nhead and carefully scrutinize every suspicious point that was visible,\r\nand then he walked slowly toward the spot where the canoe was concealed.\r\nWhether his low stoop was caused by the weight of his game, or whether\r\nit was a precautionary measure on his part, was difficult to decide. The\r\nboys at once became painfully excited and alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"They will see him! they will see him!\" said Elwood, \"and it will be all\r\nover with us. What a pity! when he has got along so well!\"\r\n\r\n\"Can we not warn him in some manner? The Indians do not know how near he\r\nis, nor does he know how close they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we do it?\" asked Elwood, who was anxious to give Tim some\r\nwarning of his danger. \"If we make any sign the Indians will see us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not; for they are not looking in this direction all the time,\r\nwhile Tim knows that we are watching him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but he has his hands full to see that the savages do not find\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nThe case looked critical indeed. Tim was nearing the point where it\r\nseemed inevitable that a discovery should take place. He paused at\r\nnearly every step or two, looked behind him and up and down the river in\r\na manner that showed plainly enough his fear of his enemies. Elwood\r\nBrandon in his eagerness had risen to his feet, and was looking intently\r\nat him, waiting until he should cast his eye toward the island that he\r\nmight give him warning. But the Irishman was so occupied with his\r\nenemies that he appeared to forget the existence of his friends.\r\n\r\nElwood did not remove his gaze, and all at once he saw him raise his\r\nhead. Quick as a flash the boy sprung up a foot or two from the ground\r\nand waved his hat toward him.\r\n\r\n\"Did he see me?\" he asked, as he sunk down to the earth again.\r\n\r\n\"He has paused and is looking toward us.\"\r\n\r\nTim had caught sight of the signal of the boy, but was uncertain as to\r\nits meaning. The waving of the hat might be supposed as an act of\r\nencouragement than otherwise; but there was something in the silent,\r\nhurried manner of his young friend, united with the fact that he had\r\nbeen, and was still, in great personal peril, that arrested his\r\nattention and set him to thinking.\r\n\r\n\"Did the Indians see me?\" asked Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"I can't say positively, as I was looking at Tim at the moment you made\r\nyour signal, but they do not seem to act as if they had discovered us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tim saw me, didn't he? He doesn't know what to make of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irishman had laid the animal he was carrying upon the ground, and\r\nstood looking toward the inland as if waiting for some further\r\nmanifestation before advancing or retreating. Believing the safety of\r\nthe entire party demanded it, Elwood begun cautiously rising to his feet\r\nto repeat his warning, when he was quickly caught by his cousin.\r\n\r\n\"Down! those Indians are suspicious; they are looking right at us--don't\r\nstir.\"\r\n\r\nThe admonition was not a moment too soon; but while it prevented\r\ndiscovery on the part of the boys, it rendered the signal already given\r\nthe Irishman void and of no effect. Tim, seeing nothing more of his\r\nyoung friend, concluded that all was right, and lifting his game to his\r\nshoulder continued his descent until he reached his canoe. This was\r\ndrawn from its hiding place and launched in the water, and the animal\r\nplaced in the rear. Seating himself carefully in the front, Tim lifted\r\nhis paddle and began making his way toward the inland.\r\n\r\n\"Too bad! too bad!\" muttered Elwood, unable to repress his feelings. \"He\r\nis coming right out where they will have a fair chance with their\r\nrifles.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he would only turn up stream, they would see nothing of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Can't_ I warn him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Elwood, it will make matters worse. Their eyes are fixed upon us.\"\r\n\r\nGrasping the long oar Tim headed his boat somewhat up stream, so as not\r\nto let it drift by the island, and commenced paddling across. He had\r\ngone twenty rods or thereabouts when he was discovered by the Indians,\r\nand one of them raised his rifle and took aim at him.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, Tim, drop down, or you'll be shot!\" called out Howard, forgetful\r\nof his own danger in the single hope of saving his friend from a violent\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant that this cry was uttered the terrified boy saw a\r\npuff of smoke issue from the Indian rifle, and simultaneous with the\r\nsharp crack Tim O'Rooney was seen to fall flat in the canoe.\r\n\r\n\"He is shot!\" called out Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"It is time then for us to do some of the same kind of business,\"\r\nreplied Howard, sighting his own gun at the savage upon the shore. The\r\ndistance was too great and his skill too slight to guide the ball with\r\nanything like certainty, but it skipped over the water at their very\r\nfeet, and so alarmed them that they immediately dodged back under the\r\nshelter of the rocks and trees.\r\n\r\n\"What is the use?\" asked Elwood gloomily. \"Poor Tim is killed and there\r\nis no chance for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look! he is not dead!\" whispered Howard.\r\n\r\nThe head of the Irishman was seen to rise stealthily from the bottom of\r\nthe canoe, and to peer around, and then to dash down again as though\r\nfearful of another shot.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe he has been struck!\" added Howard. \"He dropped down so\r\nas to save himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I hope so, for we need him bad enough. See! he is fixing the body\r\nof the animal so that it shall be between him and the Indians' guns.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the case. Tim was arranging and placing the carcass so that it\r\nmight shield his own body while he managed the paddle. This completed he\r\nturned his face toward his young friends and called across the water:\r\n\r\n\"Be aisy, me darlings! The owld bullet come close, but not a hair of Tim\r\nO'Rooney's head was touched, and thanks be to heaven for it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nDRIFTING AWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bullet of the treacherous Indian had indeed whizzed harmlessly by\r\nthe head of Tim O'Rooney and when he fell to the bottom of the canoe it\r\nwas for the purpose of preventing any more of their missiles passing too\r\nnear him.\r\n\r\nThe savages, hastily driven to shelter by the unexpected shot from the\r\nisland, did not by any means relinquish their designs upon the\r\nunfortunate white man in the canoe. He who had taken the quick aim and\r\nfired saw that his bullet missed, but he understood the disadvantage of\r\nhis enemy, and was confident that he would still fall into their hands.\r\n\r\nAs we have shown, when the Irishman was thus suddenly interrupted, he\r\nwas but a short distance from the shore. So abruptly compelled to\r\nrelinquish his paddle and simply shelter his person, the current carried\r\nhim quite rapidly down the stream.\r\n\r\nTim did not become sensible of his disadvantage until he had drifted\r\nbelow the island, and then upon partly rising to use his paddle the\r\ncrack of a gun from the shore told him that he was watched by vigilant\r\neyes, and that _that_ occupation was vetoed most unmistakably.\r\n\r\nForced thus to act entirely on the defensive, he carefully drew out his\r\nrifle and resting it on the body of his game waited his chance to avenge\r\nhimself upon the unrelenting savages. He could tell from the faint blue\r\nsmoke that curled upward where they were concealed, but could not catch\r\nsight of them.\r\n\r\nHad they shown themselves, the Irishman knew it was about impossible for\r\nhim to harm them at such a distance, while their dexterity in the use of\r\nthe gun made it too dangerous for him to expose himself to their fire.\r\nHe watched them until he had floated quite a way below, when he began to\r\nhope that they had given up their designs upon him, and he might make\r\nhis way back to his friends upon the island in safety.\r\n\r\nBut when on the point of rising to a sitting position he saw them whisk\r\nthrough the bushes he knew they were following him along the\r\nshore--following him, too, with that skill and stealth which prevented\r\nhis getting a shot at them, and placing it totally out of his power to\r\nprevent himself from being \"commanded by their fire.\"\r\n\r\nAs may well be imagined, Howard and Elwood were deeply interested\r\nspectators of these events. Now that they had revealed their presence\r\nupon the island, and there was no further use in attempting to conceal\r\nthe fact, they were eager to render their companion all the assistance\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nBut the nature of the occurrences made them helpless. Tim had drifted\r\nsuch a distance down stream, and had consequently drawn his enemies so\r\nfar after him, that they had not the slightest chance of reaching them\r\nwith their rifles, if they chose to expose themselves. They could only\r\nwatch, therefore, and pray for their safety.\r\n\r\nFloating slowly onward, onward, they observed that Tim's canoe gradually\r\nswerved to the left until it disappeared around a curve in the river. It\r\ncrossed the center and was nearer the western than the eastern shore.\r\nThis seemed to show that, despite his unfavorable situation, he was able\r\nto impart a motion to the boat, which, slight as it was, would\r\neventually bring him to the opposite side of the stream.\r\n\r\nNothing more was seen of the Indians, although the report of several\r\nguns, heard within a half-hour of the disappearance of the canoe,\r\nprevented their feeling too sanguine over the position of Tim O'Rooney.\r\n\r\n\"We can now see the blunder he committed,\" said Howard. \"He did wrong in\r\ngoing to the eastern bank when he could have secured his game as well\r\nupon the other side.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he will be able to get away, unless they have a canoe with\r\nwhich to follow him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even then he can take to the woods and hide himself until dark, and\r\nthen make his way back to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, but fear he will be prevented or overtaken before he can\r\nreach shelter.\"\r\n\r\n\"But think, Howard, he has a gun and plenty of ammunition, and there are\r\nbut three of them. I should say they would hesitate some time before\r\nadvancing upon him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he is a poor shot, like ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"He could not miss them if they came very close to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; there seems to be a good chance, if they don't find more Indians\r\nto unite with them in the hunt.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a contingency that had not occurred to Elwood, and he was\r\nalmost overwhelmed at its import until he came to reason upon it, when\r\nthe likelihood of such being the case dwindled away until it almost\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n\"We have seen no large bodies of savages, and I don't believe they care\r\nenough about catching or slaying a single man to go to all that\r\ntrouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so much trouble, perhaps, as you are apt to think. War is the\r\nbusiness of the American Indians, you know, as it is of all barbarous\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"But look at Ned Trimble and his friends. There are but three of them,\r\nand I have no doubt that their security is in their strength--otherwise\r\nthey would not be so indifferent as to what is going on around them. You\r\nremember they did not see us until we first spoke to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it appeared; but I have an idea that they knew of our presence\r\nbefore Tim discovered them.\"\r\n\r\n\"They did not show it, at any rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"They looked surprised when we came up, but if we had been enemies\r\ninstead of friends I believe we would have been the surprised parties.\r\nThey have lived too long in the wilds of California to permit a party of\r\nstrangers to steal upon them unaware.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is to become of us if Tim doesn't come back?\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to put ourselves under the care of Shasta--that is, if he\r\ngets well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you call him _Shasta_? Where did you hear that name?\"\r\n\r\n\"The only word I have heard him speak sounded like that, and I do not\r\nknow of any better name. Can you think of one?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; that is good enough; let him be called Shasta, then. There may be a\r\ngreater Providence in our coming upon this island than we imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a Providence in everything that occurs, though it may be that\r\nwe are not always able to see it. Do you remember the copy we had so\r\noften at school, 'Misfortunes are often blessings in disguise?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but like the truths that were driven into our heads so often at\r\nschool, we fail to appreciate them until some occasion like this\r\nimpresses them upon our minds. But I declare, Howard, we are turning\r\nphilosophers.\"\r\n\r\n\"What better can we do, when there is nothing else to employ ourselves\r\nabout? We need all our philosophy at such a time.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we must not forget our patient, Shasta.\"\r\n\r\n\"True. He had gone almost out of my mind until you referred to him a\r\nmoment ago. Let us look at him.\"\r\n\r\nThe two had been stationed near the lower end of the island, and they\r\nnow walked back to where they had left the suffering stranger. What was\r\ntheir surprise to see him standing on his feet, his blanket wrapped\r\naround him, and his attitude and position such as to raise a strong\r\nsuspicion that he understood all that had taken place within the last\r\nhour or two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nA HUNT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Tim O'Rooney left the island and crossed to the eastern shore of\r\nthe Salinas he had almost forgotten the existence of any such thing as\r\nhostile Indians. He was after something to eat, and some how or other it\r\nseemed to him that the climate of California had given him a most\r\nravenous appetite, which demanded satisfaction regardless of\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nTouching land, he pulled his canoe up the bank to prevent its being\r\ncarried away by the current, and then plunged boldly into the forest.\r\nThe land from the river rose quite rapidly until it reached an elevation\r\nof several hundred feet, when it was broken by gorges, ravines and\r\nchasms, which made it rattier difficult to travel, and gave it an\r\nextremely wild and picturesque appearance.\r\n\r\nFairly among these broken hills, Tim began to look for his game, but for\r\na time saw nothing to draw his fire. Finally he reached a wild-looking\r\ngorge which descended over a hundred feet below him, while upon the\r\nopposite side it rose to a greater height than the place upon which he\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nThe Irishman was so struck with the wild scenery that he stood a few\r\nmoments contemplating it in silent admiration, when all at once he\r\nbecame conscious that something else beside himself was engaged in\r\nlooking. Directly across the gorge, so as to be almost opposite to him,\r\nhe saw the head of an animal which he recognized at once as belonging to\r\na black-tailed deer.\r\n\r\n\"Be the powers! but you're jist the gintleman that I'd like to make an\r\nacquaintance with, as me mither said when me father axed her hand in\r\nmarriage.\"\r\n\r\nTim drew his rifle carefully and rested it upon a rock beside him. The\r\ndeer gazed at him with that expression of stupid wonder which wild\r\nanimals assume when confronted with something, and they seem to be\r\ndebating with themselves whether to leap away at high speed or to stare\r\na moment longer.\r\n\r\nThe distance was so slight that Tim was sure of his aim. Nevertheless,\r\nhe took great care in sighting his piece, and as his finger gently\r\npressed the trigger, he held his breath. The bullet sped true, entering\r\njust below and between the eyes, and with such deadly effect that the\r\nmortally wounded deer sprung several feet in the air and fell dead\r\nwithin a rod of the spot where it had stood when struck.\r\n\r\n\"That is plaisant,\" muttered the Irishman, as he saw the animal fall,\r\n\"and yez hav the distinguished honor of baing the first deer that Tim\r\nO'Rooney brought down; but yez ain't the first he fired at--but whist,\r\nTim, don't be telling your secrets, for somebody else might larn them.\"\r\n\r\nHe now began making his way carefully down the gorge in order to ascend\r\nupon the opposite side and secure his prize. He had no thought that the\r\nreport of his gun could reach the ears of hostile persons, and he did\r\nnot heed anything except the place and manner in which he put his feet\r\nin going down and up the ravine.\r\n\r\nAfter no little toiling he reached the dead body, and found that he had\r\nshot a rather small black-tailed deer. It was in middling condition, and\r\nwas the very prize he was anxious to secure for his hungry self and\r\nequally hungry friends.\r\n\r\nAs he stood admiring it, for the first time the thought of personal\r\ndanger crossed his mind, and he glanced hurriedly around him, but saw\r\nnothing to occasion alarm. Then he leaned forward and gazed down the\r\ngorge, and as he did so he descried three Indians looking up the side of\r\nthe chasm. Slight as was the distance his head projected, it was seen by\r\nthem, and he only drew it back to escape the effect of three discharges\r\nof their guns.\r\n\r\n\"And that is your shtyle of saluting a gintleman is it?\" said Tim in\r\nsome trepidation. \"But yez has a forcible way of saying 'how do yez do,'\r\nin this counthry, that a stranger would do well to imitate.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irishman hastily debated with himself upon the best plan to pursue\r\nto escape the serious peril that threatened him, for he was sure the\r\nsavages would follow up their shot.\r\n\r\n\"The best thing I can do is to lave,\" he concluded. \"There is strong\r\nraison for belaving that I've given some one slight offinse by walking\r\ninto their house without ringing the bell.\"\r\n\r\nHe stooped over and lifted his game. He found its weight somewhat less\r\nthan he had suspected.\r\n\r\n\"I have no objiction to your going wid me. If I has to have the same\r\ndispute about ivery deer I tips over, I may as well hang on to the fust\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nSlinging it over his shoulder, he began his return with the carcass. It\r\nproved beneficial to him in a way that he had little suspected. Not\r\nwishing to go any further down the gorge, where there was reason to fear\r\na collision with the savages, he clambered still higher, taking great\r\ncare to shield himself from observation from below.\r\n\r\nThis made his labor excessive, and he was often obliged to pause and\r\nrest himself. But at length he reached what might be termed the brow of\r\nthe hill, and began making his way along the edge of a smaller ravine,\r\nthat led toward the river. While thus engaged, the body of the deer\r\nstruck a projecting rock, and before Tim could save himself he rolled\r\nover and over for a distance of twenty odd feet, coming down plump upon\r\nthe deer without injuring himself in the least.\r\n\r\n\"I'm obliged to yez,\" he said, as he rose and stared around with a\r\nbewildered air. \"That was kind in yez, and I'll not forget the favor.\"\r\n\r\nAgain raising his carcass to his shoulder, he resumed his journey toward\r\nthe river. But as he progressed the weight upon his shoulder seemed to\r\ngrow heavier, and he was obliged to pause and rest himself quite often.\r\nOn these occasions he looked around him half-expecting to see the three\r\nsavages spring out of the bushes.\r\n\r\nIf such a thing should occur, Tim had already decided upon his mode of\r\nprocedure. He intended to sink to the ground at once, with the body of\r\nthe deer as a sheltering breastwork, and make as gallant fight as\r\npossible. His success in bringing down his game, when it was fully fifty\r\nyards distant, gave him quite a flattering estimate of his prowess.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, as the Irishman had anticipated, hastened up the gorge to\r\nsecure the daring hunter, who had so audaciously exposed himself to\r\ntheir anger. It required some time for them to find the exact spot where\r\nthe deer had fallen, and when they did so, they followed him readily by\r\nthe blood which had trickled from its drooping head, which as Tim bore\r\nhis prize away he little dreamed would betray the course he took.\r\n\r\nWhen the point of Tim's fall was reached, all signs of his trail ceased,\r\nand they supposed he had checked the flow of blood, and thus concealed\r\nhis tracks. The surface over which he traversed being rock and flinty\r\nground, left no evidence of his passage; and resigning, therefore, the\r\npursuit in this manner, they made their way leisurely down to the river\r\nand waited until the hunter appeared.\r\n\r\nTim's heart beat high with hope when he found himself close by the\r\nstream and saw nothing of his pursuers. The hasty signal given by Elwood\r\nBrandon, as we have shown, caused him some uneasiness, but not being\r\nrepeated, and being very anxious to get back to the island, he placed\r\nthe deer in the canoe and paddled away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nA SINGULAR ESCAPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shot from the treacherous Indian upon the shore was the first\r\nintelligent warning Tim had that he was discovered by them. The kind\r\nProvidence who had so often turned aside the dangerous missile still\r\nprotected him, and when he so suddenly dropped to the bottom of his\r\ncanoe, it was with a bullet-hole through his coat but not through his\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\"Another illigant compliment to mesilf that it would afford me great\r\npleasure to return, and if you'll only be kind enough to wait a few\r\nmoments, I'll do the same.\"\r\n\r\nBut ere he could bring his gun to bear, the wild shot from the island\r\ndrove the savages to cover, and raised the Irishman's finger that was\r\npressing the trigger.\r\n\r\nWe have already told how, when he undertook to use the paddle, he found\r\nit too dangerous, and coming again behind the deer, he floated down the\r\ncurrent. This, after the severe labor he had undergone, was an agreeable\r\nchange, but he was not long in discovering it was dangerous. He was\r\ndrifting away from his friends, and the further he went the greater did\r\nthe danger become to both parties. He speedily discovered that the\r\nIndians were following him, and the interposing body of the black-tailed\r\ndeer was a most effectual protection. More than his own bullets were\r\nburied in it ere he had gone a half-mile down stream.\r\n\r\n\"If I entertained a small doubt that yez was killed, I couldn't howld it\r\nwith them bullets rattlin' in your hide, me owld friend.\"\r\n\r\nThe efforts of a child, if steadily persevered in, would move the Great\r\nEastern in calm water, and Tim was not long in making the discovery\r\nthat, if he could not use the paddle, he still was able to exert a\r\nmotive power upon the canoe by a very slight means.\r\n\r\nReaching his hand over the side, he began paddling the water, and soon\r\nhad the gratifying consciousness that he was moving across the river.\r\nTrue, it was slow, but it was nevertheless certain and positive, and was\r\ncarrying him further away from his troublesome pursuers, and must\r\neventually bring him against the western shore.\r\n\r\nBut when the island disappeared from view, and he had barely crossed the\r\ncenter of the stream, he begun to think that this species of locomotion\r\nwas rather tardy, and he partially came to the sitting position and\r\nventured to take his paddle in hand. A discharge from the shore warned\r\nhim of the danger he ran, and he was reluctantly forced to drop his head\r\nagain and resort to his tedious method of moving.\r\n\r\nBy this time the afternoon was well advanced, and it looked as though it\r\nwould be fully dark before Tim could regain the ground he had lost. Now\r\nand then he peered over the top of the deer to see whether he could\r\npossibly catch sight of his acquaintances, but they whisked from cover\r\nto cover so dexterously that he had not the encouragement even to hope\r\nfor success, and so he did not fire.\r\n\r\nBut a new fear took possession of the fugitive. If they were Indians, it\r\nwas to be expected that they had canoes somewhere, and if they were\r\nspeedily found, he would as speedily be overhauled.\r\n\r\n\"In which case Tim O'Rooney will lose his daar, and be the same towken\r\nlose himself, and the boys won't get their dinner.\"\r\n\r\nHe squinted at the sun, now low in the sky, and quickly asked himself:\r\n\r\n\"If a man doesn't git his dinner, and ates half-way atween noon and\r\nmidnight, is it his dinner or supper? But that is a mighty question, is\r\nthe same.\"\r\n\r\nHe evidently concluded it was too vast for him to decide, for he\r\nspeedily dismissed it and turned his attention to that which more nearly\r\nconcerned him. Still toiling with his hand, much in the same manner that\r\na child would dabble in the water, he kept up the tardy movement of the\r\ncanoe until he began to grow fearless again, and he took his paddle once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nNow, when it was almost too late, he found that he could use it without\r\ndanger to himself. By bending his body forward, the deer protected him\r\nand he could labor with impunity.\r\n\r\n\"Tim O'Rooney, I fears yez are lacking in the iliments which go to make\r\nup a mon of sense. Why didn't yez think of this when it would have done\r\nyez more good?\"\r\n\r\nWhen he was yet within a few yards of shore, he looked back and was not\r\na little frightened to see that the savages had launched a canoe and\r\nwere coming across the river with the speed of the swallow.\r\n\r\n\"Whisht now! but that is onexpected,\" said he, as he redoubled his own\r\nexertions. Observing that his pursuers were rapidly gaining, he suddenly\r\nrecalled an artifice that he had seen practiced during his experience in\r\nthe mines years before. Catching up his rifle, he aimed it at the\r\nadvancing Indians.\r\n\r\nQuick as a flash they ducked their heads and held up the two paddles\r\nthey were using as a protection against the expected bullet. But it was\r\nnot Tim's purpose to fire. He knew better than to do that, for ere he\r\ncould have reloaded they would have been upon him.\r\n\r\nThe minute they stooped he lowered his gun and caught up his paddle and\r\nused it furiously. In this he was imitated by the Indians, whose\r\nsuperior skill sent their frail vessel forward with such velocity that\r\nit looked as if they would reach the shore but a short distance behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAgain he raised his gun, and as before they attempted to screen\r\nthemselves from danger, while the next impulse of his paddle sent his\r\ncanoe high up the bank, and he sprung out and plunged into the woods.\r\n\r\nTim O'Rooney had no thought of the particular manner in which he was to\r\neffect his escape. His one desire was to get away from them. The\r\nprobabilities are that, beyond all doubt, he would have been speedily\r\novertaken and slain but for one of those singular occurrences which do\r\nnot happen to a man more than once in a life-time, and which seem to\r\nshow unmistakably that Providence often interferes directly in favor of\r\nthe innocent and distressed.\r\n\r\nHe had run perhaps a couple of hundred yards, or thereabouts, when a\r\npeculiar whoop from his pursuers announced that they had landed and were\r\nnow coming speedily behind him. He knew that he had no chance in\r\nrunning, and was looking about him for some place in which to take\r\nshelter, when a furious growl startled him and he found himself within a\r\ndozen feet from enormous grizzly bear. This quadruped seemed anxious for\r\na fight, for he came straight at the fugitive, who might certainly be\r\nexcused for being dazed at the combination of dangers by which he was\r\nsurrounded.\r\n\r\nThat of the grizzly bear was the greatest; for with mouth open and his\r\nred tongue lolling out he came fiercely at him. His gait was awkward and\r\nshambling, but he managed to get over the ground very rapidly. Indeed,\r\nthe danger was so imminent that Tim, seeing there was no choice, raised\r\nhis gun and fired at the monster.\r\n\r\nThe bullet struck him near the head, but it did not kill him, nor did it\r\ncause him to fall, but it bewildered him, and he rose on his hind feet\r\nand clawed the air as if the bullet was a splinter and he was seeking to\r\npluck it from his flesh.\r\n\r\nThis bewilderment was the means of Tim being saved. Before the animal\r\nhad entirely recovered, he had darted out of sight, and when the Indians\r\ncame up the bear was just in \"fighting trim,\" and immediately made at\r\nthem. Consequently they were compelled to give over all thoughts of the\r\nflying hunter and attend to their own personal safety. What the final\r\nresult was Tim never learned, and we cannot speak with certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nSHASTA'S HUNT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the Pah Utah in the extremity of his suffering had been betrayed into\r\nthe extraordinary weakness of manifesting it, he now seemed anxious to\r\nmake amends for the humiliating fact. It may have been that among his\r\nown people he would have restrained those utterances which declared his\r\nagony, and borne the utmost with the stoicism of his race; but knowing\r\nthat civilization does not teach such outward indifference to pain, he\r\nhad adopted the surest means to reach the sympathy of the white\r\nstrangers; or, if we may conjecture still further, the consciousness of\r\nthe instinctive feud between the American and Caucasian race told him\r\nthat the plan he took was the only one that offered safety to himself.\r\nWhat reason had he to believe that the hunters were kind of heart? If he\r\nhid his distress, would he not be treated as a well Indian? And was\r\nthere any but the one common ground upon which the two races met?\r\n\r\nBut the fever had passed and he was himself again. True, he was still\r\nfeeble, and his limbs trembled at times like those of an old man; but\r\nthe disease had gone, and the stern, unbending will had resumed its\r\nsway. He was not a child, but he was Shasta, the Pah Utah Indian.\r\n\r\nThe inexperience of Elwood Brandon and Howard Lawrence with these\r\nstrange people made this savage an enigma to them. As he stood with his\r\narms folded, his blanket wrapped around him, his long black hair\r\nstreaming over his shoulders, and the mingling of the paint on his crown\r\nand over his face, and his midnight eyes fixed upon them, it was hard\r\nindeed to conjecture the thoughts filtrating through his brain.\r\n\r\nBut there is a language in which the human heart can speak--that of\r\nemotion. The boys felt no fear--ingratitude is not an element of the\r\nsavage character, though sad to say it is sometimes manifested among us\r\nof greater moral pretensions.\r\n\r\nHe looked at them as they came up and paused a few feet from him.\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be better?\" asked Elwood, feeling it incumbent that he\r\nshould make some remark, even though it was incomprehensible to their\r\ndusky friend. He muttered something and then stretched out his arms as\r\nif to show that he had recovered from his illness.\r\n\r\nAt this point Terror went up to the savage and snuffed around him, as if\r\nto satisfy himself of his identity. The latter laid his hand upon his\r\nknife and watched the dog narrowly, but he appeared to judge the animal\r\nby the company, and quietly removed his hand and folded his arms again.\r\n\r\nHe stood thus a moment, when he pointed to the eastern shore and then\r\ndown the river, nodding his head and gesticulating somewhat excitedly.\r\nThe boys in return nodded, which satisfied the aborigine. All at once he\r\nmoved off and strode rapidly to the other side of the island, where he\r\ndrew forth a tiny canoe and shoved it into the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"The Indian drew forth a tiny canoe and shoved it into\r\nthe water\"]\r\n\r\nWhen it was launched he turned again toward his friends, and looking\r\nsteadily at them a moment, once more pointed down stream, sprang into\r\nthe boat and dipped his paddle first upon one side and then upon the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIt was a sight to see him manage the canoe! It seemed made to contain a\r\nsingle person, and the way it skimmed over the water was a perfect\r\nmarvel to the spectators. It appeared fairly to fly, scarcely touching\r\nthe water, while human art could not have exceeded the skill with which\r\nhe managed the paddle. He sat as motionless as a statue, like the\r\nartistic violinist. It could not be seen that he raised his arms above\r\nthe elbow.\r\n\r\nThe sun was just going over the western hills, and the reflection of the\r\nwater as it flashed and rippled from his paddle gave a fairy-like\r\nappearance to the Indian as he sped down stream that was pleasing to the\r\nlast degree.\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\" asked Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"It means that he is going to the rescue of Tim.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he goes after him he will bring him back. Just see the way in which\r\nhe manages that canoe! It is worth going a hundred miles to see!\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt he has practiced it long enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what of our remaining here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how it can be helped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose those Indians that have followed Tim take it into their heads\r\nto pay us a visit?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will take all their attention, if Shasta concludes to have a part in\r\nthe matter, and they won't have time to think of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose they _do_ come back here?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must be prepared at any rate; but don't let the thought make us\r\nuneasy. We have two good guns, and Terror would be worth half a dozen\r\nmen if we get into close quarters.\"\r\n\r\n\"He may be all that; but a rifle-shot could quickly stretch him out\r\nlifeless. It won't do for us to go to sleep until Tim or Shasta come\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not. I do not feel like it, even if we were satisfied that it\r\nwas safe for us to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at Shasta!\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian was far down the stream, still speeding with his\r\nextraordinary velocity, using his arms as though they would never tire.\r\n\r\n\"So sick a few hours ago!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well enough now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you notice how he trembled?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he is still weak, but an Indian soon recovers himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"All he needed was the root which he chewed and which cured him almost\r\nimmediately. These savages are what you call Thomsonians I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are the original ones no doubt. I have heard that some of their\r\nmedicine men are the most skillful of physicians.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; we hear all kinds of things about them. What stories we have read,\r\nand yet they don't look and act as I imagined they would. I thought they\r\nwould suffer and die without showing the least pain, and yet Shasta\r\nwasn't anyways backward about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt the poor fellow felt bad enough, and he hasn't got over it\r\nyet. You can tell that from his appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will take all his skill to help Tim. Just as like as not he will\r\ntake Shasta for an enemy and shoot him.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they only see each other before dark, so that Tim can understand\r\nthat he has a friend at work.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you see it is nearly dark now, and it is likely he is in the woods\r\nby this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"What danger can he be in then?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Indians may cross over to follow him.\"\r\n\r\nThey were silent a while when Elwood suddenly exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose Shasta is an enemy and has gone to help his people?\"\r\n\r\nHoward shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No fear of that. That is the last thing that can occur.\"\r\n\r\nThe night gradually deepened and proved to be quite dark, a faint moon\r\nshedding a luster that made the dim light more impressive. The boys\r\nwalked back and forth, watching and listening for some evidence of the\r\napproach of their friends, and gradually becoming apprehensive despite\r\nthe attempt each made to cheer the spirits of the other.\r\n\r\nIt was not until quite late that Terror gave utterance to a low, warning\r\ngrowl, and as they looked across the river they descried a dark object\r\ncautiously approaching.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" whispered Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"It is too dark to tell; but it can't be Tim or Shasta for it's coming\r\nfrom the wrong direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aisy now, Mr. Shasta, aisy I say, for the boys may be asleep and we\r\nwon't come upon them too sudden't like, as me uncle said when he sat on\r\na barrel of gun-powder and it blowed up with him. Aisy, Mr. Shasta,\r\naisy!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE NIGHT VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe indistinct object gradually took shape, and the boys then saw Shasta\r\nsitting in his small canoe, while directly behind him was Tim O'Rooney,\r\nhis left hand extended backward and grasping the prow of his own boat,\r\nwhich was being towed by the Indian.\r\n\r\nThe next moment the foremost lightly touched the shore and the savage\r\nsprung out, quickly followed by the Irishman.\r\n\r\n\"I beg yez pardon, boys, for the time I tuk to git your dinner; but to\r\nshpake the thruth, I was unavoidably detained, as me brother writ me\r\nwhen he was locked up in Tipperary jail on his way to visit me.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are glad enough to see you again, but where is your game?\"\r\n\r\n\"Worrah, worrah, but I had bad luck wid it. When I tuk it ashore, I sat\r\nit down for a minit, and I hadn't the time to pick it up again.\"\r\n\r\n\"But tell us all about it.\"\r\n\r\nThis was quickly done, up to the point where Tim was saved by the timely\r\nappearance of the grizzly bear, when, as may well be supposed, the\r\nexpressions of wonder were loud and continued.\r\n\r\n\"You saw nothing more of your pursuers?\" asked Howard.\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit--nor be the same towken do I think they saw me.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you and Shasta meet?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was shtrange, was the same. After I found I was cl'ar of the\r\nvarmints, from the raisin that their exclusive attention was occupied by\r\nthe b'ar, I stopped and went to thinking--did I. I could saa the great\r\nnecessity of our having me own canoe and I went back to whom I left the\r\nsame. It took me some time to find it, and when I did find it, it wasn't\r\nit, but the one that belonged to the red gintlemen.\r\n\r\n\"There was little difference atwixt the two and I thought the best thing\r\nwas to make a thrade, and just as I thought that I spied another canoe\r\ncoming along the shore as though it was looking for something. I stepped\r\nback and raised the hammer of my gun, when I obsarved there was but one\r\nInjin in the same--was there. So, 'Tim,' says I, ''twould be a shame,'\r\nand I lowered me gun agin.\r\n\r\n\"Just then, and fur the life of me I don't know what put it into me\r\nhead, I thought it was Shasta, though I knowed I had lift him with a big\r\npain all through him. So I give a low whistle like, and called out\r\n'Shasta,' and with one whip of his paddle he sent his canoe right at my\r\nfaat, though I was sure he didn't saa me, and then waited fur me to step\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\"But he's a quaar fellow, is Shasta,\" added Tim. \"I rached out me hand\r\nto shake his own, but he never noticed it, but motioned fur me to stow\r\nmesilf into the bottom of the canoe; and thin, after some muttering and\r\nthrowing of his arms, I could saa he wanted me to howld on to the other\r\ncanoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I did the same, and the way he towed us over the water would have\r\nfrightened a steamboat.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a smart fellow, indeed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian upon landing had just pulled his canoe slightly up the bank\r\nand then had gone at once to the opposite side of the island where he\r\nhad lain when sick. They could see him walking slowly back and forth us\r\nif searching for something which he had some difficulty in finding.\r\n\r\n\"Well, boys, I shpose you are hungry,\" said Tim, \"If yez isn't I begins\r\nto howld a very strong suspicion that it's meself that is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Elwood, \"we are both very hungry, but we had little\r\nappetite so long as we knew you were in danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was very kind of yez to restrain your appetite out of respict to me,\r\nand I'll not forgit to do the same when yez git into throuble.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can afford to go supperless to-night,\" remarked Howard, \"and feast\r\non the contemplation of our good fortune. There was a time when our\r\nprospects looked pretty dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, sir; you may well say that. When I had the big bear walking at me\r\nfrom one direction and the three red gintlemen from the other, I thought\r\nto mesilf what a shplendid opportunity there was for the illigant\r\nexercise of one's idaas. But it was all the doings of the good Lord\r\nabove,\" added Tim very reverently.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; there can be no doubt of that,\" replied Howard. \"He has cared for\r\nus all the time.\"\r\n\r\nTim now gave an account of his adventures in his hunt after the deer,\r\nprevious to when he was first seen from the island. When he had finished\r\nElwood asked:\r\n\r\n\"Are we to stay here over night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not, but I defers to the judgment of Mr. Shasta. It's just as\r\nhe says about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"He appears to be taken up with something over yonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is searching for some object that he left when he made up his mind\r\nto get well,\" said Howard.\r\n\r\n\"He must know all that has occurred, for when we came back from watching\r\nyou, there he stood with his arms folded, and a look in his eye that\r\nsaid he understood more about matters and things than we imagined he\r\ndid.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must know that we are in danger so long as we are upon this island,\r\nand I should think he would leave it while it is dark.\"'\r\n\r\n\"Do yez rest on that pint?\" said Tim. \"The red gintlemen will attind to\r\nthe same--will he.\"\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the Pah Utah was observed walking slowly toward them,\r\nhis long blanket grasped at the breast by his left hand, while his right\r\nwas free. As soon as he came up he pointed at the canoes and muttered\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\"What does he mean?\" asked Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"Terror understands him better than we do,\" replied Howard, as the\r\nNewfoundland sprung into the larger boat and nestled down near the\r\nstern.\r\n\r\nOur friends were not long in imitating the action of the dog. Tim made\r\nas if to step into the Indian's boat, but he motioned him back, and took\r\nhis seat in the front of the larger canoe. The savage now produced a\r\ncord, probably the tendon of some wild animal, with which he speedily\r\nfastened the prow of the larger canoe to the stem of his own.\r\n\r\nThis done he turned the head down stream and began using his paddle with\r\nthe same wonderful dexterity he had displayed during the afternoon. The\r\nboys watched and admired his skill for a long time. The faint moon\r\nbarely revealed the shores on either hand, stretching away in misty\r\ngloom, while all before and behind them was darkness.\r\n\r\nThe muscular arms of Shasta appeared to be as tireless as the\r\npiston-rods of an engine, and at last our friends grow weary of watching\r\nhim. The boys became drowsy, and they finally lay down in the bottom of\r\nthe boat, with their blanket over them, and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nIn the course of an hour Tim did the same, and the Pah Utah was this\r\nleft alone to ply the canoe, the Newfoundland now and then raising his\r\nhead and looking over the edge as if to satisfy himself that all was\r\nright.\r\n\r\nOnce near the middle of the night Elwood awoke, and pushing his blanket\r\nfrom his face, raised himself on his elbow and looked around. The same\r\npicture met his eye--the dark-hued Shasta, his long hair streaming over\r\nhis shoulders, the blanket down to his waist, and his bronzed arms\r\nworking with the silence, skill and regularity of a perfect machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nA PAH UTAH'S METHOD OF FISHING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gray light of dawn was spreading over the wood and river when Elwood\r\nBrandon again opened his eyes. He was somewhat startled to see nothing\r\nof the Pah Utah, although his canoe was still in the advance; but a\r\nsecond look showed that they were resting against the bank, and the\r\nIndian lay asleep in the front of his boat, his body and face covered\r\nentirely by his somber-hued blanket.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt he needs rest, and so I will not wake him!\" was Elwood's\r\nthought, as he carefully raised himself to the sitting position. But he\r\nhad scarcely moved when the end of Shasta's blanket was raised, and the\r\nboy saw his dark eyes fixed inquiringly upon him. Satisfied that there\r\nwas nothing wrong the blanket dropped again and all was still.\r\n\r\nElwood now looked around. Howard was sleeping soundly, his feet resting\r\nagainst the shaggy sides of Terror, who was equally oblivious to the\r\nexternal world. There could be no doubt of Tim's somnolence for he gave\r\nunmistakable evidence of it. The light was just sufficient to afford a\r\ndistinct view of the other shore, and in the clear summer air of the\r\nmorning it had a cool appearance, very pleasing and refreshing to the\r\neye.\r\n\r\nElwood, of course, had no knowledge of the distance they had come during\r\nthe night; but he believed Shasta had not slept more than an hour or\r\ntwo, and that as a consequence they were many miles from their starting\r\npoint--far enough at any rate to make them perfectly easy regarding the\r\ntroublesome visitors of yesterday.\r\n\r\nHe noticed the peculiar character of the place in which Shasta had run\r\nthe canoe. It was a small indentation covered with overhanging limbs and\r\nshrubbery in such manner that while the whites could peer out upon the\r\nriver there was no danger of their being seen by any passers-by, unless\r\nparticular suspicion was directed toward the spot.\r\n\r\nElwood's limbs were so cramped from the forced position in which he had\r\nlain during the night, that he concluded there could be no harm in\r\nstepping ashore to yawn and stretch himself. Of course he would take\r\ngood care not to wander away from the boat, as he had seen the danger of\r\nsecession in a small party like theirs. As he was stepping over the\r\ncanoe he saw Shasta looking at him so intently that he paused. The Pah\r\nUtah nodded, but made a rather odd gesture, which Elwood took as a\r\ncaution not to wander away. He nodded assent and stepped out upon the\r\nland. At this juncture Howard awoke and followed him.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we try and hunt something for breakfast?\" asked Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"Tim's troubles have proved that it is hardly safe; I think we had\r\nbetter leave all such matters to Shasta.\"\r\n\r\nThis was good advice certainly, and the boys acted upon it. They walked\r\nup and down the banks of the river admiring the beautiful scenery, but\r\nseeing nothing of wild animals. They heard the whirr of a flock of birds\r\noverhead, alarmed by the apparition of two human beings, but the\r\nluxuriant vegetation allowed but a glimpse of them as they shot away.\r\n\r\nWhile a few rods distant, they heard the discharge of a rifle, and in no\r\nlittle trepidation they hastened back to their friends. They were\r\nrelieved by finding that it had been done by Tim O'Rooney for the\r\npurpose of affording a means of ignition to some sticks and leaves. He\r\nand the Pah Utah were on shore, making as much preparation for their\r\nbreakfast as though they had a dozen men to provide for.\r\n\r\n\"What does yez think of it?\" asked Tim.\r\n\r\n\"All very well, but where is your breakfast?\"\r\n\r\nThe Irishman jerked his thumb in a very significant manner toward\r\nShasta.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to eat him,\" laughed Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"Git out wid yer nonsense!\" retorted Tim. \"He and meself have been\r\ntalking together, and we've fixed the whole thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What language did you use?\"\r\n\r\n\"This kind of talk.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Irishman explained himself by several extravagant but\r\nmeaningless gestures.\r\n\r\nThe fire being nicely burning, Shasta took some white crumbs from a sort\r\nof receptacle in his hunting-shirt, stepped carefully into the canoe,\r\nand then gently dropped them upon the surface of the water. Our friend\r\nwatched his movements with interest.\r\n\r\nLeaning carefully over the boat, he curved his arm and held his closed\r\nfingers so that they were just within the water, looking down into the\r\nstream all the time with the fixedness of gaze that characterizes the\r\nhawk when about to dart downward after his prey.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a flight ripple was heard, and before either of the three on\r\nshore comprehended what he was doing, something flashed before their\r\ngaze, and a plump, glistening fish, fully two pounds in weight, lay\r\nfloundering at their feet.\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\" shouted Elwood in his excitement, and he was proceeding to\r\npay the Pah Utah several highly flavored compliments, when he raised his\r\nhand as a warning for them to remain quiet. Bending still further over\r\nthe canoe, he soon thrust his hand beneath, and with the same\r\nlightning-like quickness flung a still larger fish up the bank. This was\r\ncontinued for some time, until he had five fine plump-looking fellows\r\nall shining and fresh, waiting for the hungry stomachs.\r\n\r\nThey had an abundance of food, and its preparation now only remained.\r\nHere Shasta displayed his remarkable culinary skill. With his keen-edged\r\nhunting-knife he slitted the fish, excepting Terror's portion, which of\r\ncourse was devoured raw, the entire length of the bodies, and throwing\r\naside the superfluous portion, then skewered them upon some green prongs\r\nin such a manner that they were completely flat, and the entire internal\r\nand external surface exposed.\r\n\r\nThe fire, which had been burning some time, was now raked down until\r\nseveral square feet of live red coals lay bare, when one of the fish was\r\nheld down within a few inches. As soon as one side was thoroughly cooked\r\nthe other was turned under, and after this same fashion the four were\r\nmost speedily and thoroughly prepared for the palate.\r\n\r\n\"Luxurious!\" exclaimed Howard, as he took his prize and buried his teeth\r\nin its flesh. \"It is cooked to perfection--a trifle of pepper and salt\r\nwould make this the best dish I ever tasted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never enjoyed a meal more,\" replied Elwood. \"But when I come to\r\nthink, the first one I tasted in California was nearly as good as this.\"\r\n\r\nTim was too much engaged to take time for conversation. He waited until\r\nhe had filled himself to repletion, when he gave a great sigh of relief\r\nand remarked:\r\n\r\n\"I ain't hungry--not a bit; I've lost me appetite very quickly. Mr.\r\nShasta, you're an excellent cook--worthy of the honor of attending to\r\nthe wants of Timothy O'Rooney, Esquire.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pah Utah paid no heed to this praise, but contented himself with\r\ndevouring his fish, which he did until he had all that he wished, when\r\nfrom some hidden recess he produced a beautifully carved Indian pipe.\r\n\r\n\"There I'm wid yees agin,\" remarked Tim, as he replenished his own. \"The\r\npipe is very soothin' to one's faalings after sevare labor, as me\r\nbrother's wife used to say after whacking a few hours wid her\r\nbroomstick--what is your opinion upon the same, Mr. Shasta?\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian nodded his head and murmured some unintelligible reply.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" assented Tim, as he puffed forth a thick volume of smoke;\r\n\"that's me own idaas exactly, and the boys here will bear me witness\r\nthat I've always contended for the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"Ax him,\" replied Tin, nodding his head toward his dusky friend. \"He's\r\nable to explain better nor is meself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nA NIGHT DISTURBANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither the Pah Utah nor the Irishman were disposed to make a move until\r\nthey had finished their \"smoke,\" and both of them whiffed as leisurely\r\nas though they had contracted to spend several hours thus. Howard and\r\nElwood passed the time in walking around the woods and along the stream,\r\ntaking particular care not to go beyond sight of Shasta, whose black\r\norbs they could see attentively following their movements.\r\n\r\n\"All aboord!\" shouted Tim at the expiration of an hour or so, and the\r\nboys hurried down to the \"wharf\" with as much alacrity as if they had\r\nheard the last bell of the steamer.\r\n\r\nThe Indian stood upon the shore with a look of inquiry. He pointed up\r\nstream and then down.\r\n\r\n\"He is inquiring which way we wish to go,\" said Howard.\r\n\r\n\"That, is strange, after bringing us so many miles from the island.\"\r\n\r\nElwood pointed down stream, but Shasta was not satisfied; he wished to\r\nknow something more. He described several circles, terminating each time\r\nby pointing to the north. All three looked inquiringly at one other's\r\nfaces. They could not comprehend his meaning.\r\n\r\n\"What does he wish to say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I cannot tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"He wants us to travel the rest of the way by turning summersits.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing that he was not understood, the Pah Utah took the paddle from the\r\ncanoe and made in the air as if he were impelling the boat, then\r\npausing, he again pointed to the north, and took several long strides in\r\nthat direction, as though he were going to walk a long distance.\r\n\r\nElwood's eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n\"I know what, he means! I know what he means!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He wishes to ask whether we want to _go a good ways_!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" replied Howard. \"He doesn't know whether we are hunting\r\nin these parts, and wish to stay in the neighborhood, or whether we are\r\nhurrying home as fast as we can.\"\r\n\r\nShasta's motions and signs were imitated as nearly as possible, and he\r\nnodded his head and muttered something doubtless to signify that he was\r\nsatisfied. Terror whisked into the canoe and took his position in the\r\nprow, while his three masters, if a dog can own that many, arranged\r\nthemselves behind him. The tendon still united the two boats, and one\r\nsweep of Pah Utah's paddle sent the two far out into the river, where he\r\nbegan his work.\r\n\r\nFor a time our friends gave themselves up to the enjoyment of this\r\npleasant motion. At each dip of the paddle, or contraction of the iron\r\nmuscles of Shasta, they could feel the canoe jump forward as does a\r\nsteamboat under the throbs of the mighty engine. At the same time the\r\nmotion was light and airy, as if the boat were skimming over the very\r\nsurface. Indeed, by shutting the eyes and feeling the light wind fanning\r\nthe temples, it was easy to imagine that they were borne through the air\r\nby some great bird whose wings could be felt to pulsate beneath them.\r\n\r\n\"Look at that machinery!\" exclaimed Howard. \"Did you ever see anything\r\nlike it? Not an ounce of superfluous flesh upon him. See how the muscles\r\nswell and ridge, and yet he doesn't swerve his body a hair's breadth to\r\nthe right or left.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can 'paddle his own canoe,'\" laughed Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"Look at those shoulders; they are perfect mountains of muscle, and\r\nthose sinewy arm! His legs are fully as perfect, and I'll warrant he can\r\nrun a dozen miles an hour for a whole day without getting tired. He\r\nwould be a dangerous man to meet as an enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a good one as a friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I can hardly see what chances we would have had of reaching the\r\nmouth of the river without his help.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had no chance unless we could join a party of hunters and induce\r\nthem to go with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boys,\" said Tim, looking hard at them, \"it isn't right--isn't the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"That Mr. Shasta should tow us along in this shtyle, and we sit in the\r\nowld boat and permit him. No, it's wrong.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys admitted that it looked hardly proper, whereupon Tim took the\r\npaddle and began plying it with all the skill of which he was master.\r\nThe Pah Utah looked over his shoulder now and then with a strange\r\nexpression, as if he were amused at the white man's furious efforts, but\r\nhe did not abate his own labor in the least.\r\n\r\nTim O'Rooney made a great deal of splashing, occasionally flirting a\r\nshower of spray over his friends as the paddle took an unexpected twist\r\nin his hand; but, as we have said before, he had had considerable\r\nexperience in propelling a canoe, and he gave a little assistance to\r\ntheir dusky friend.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun was overhead, Shasta directed the prow of the boat toward\r\nthe western bank, and they landed in a place somewhat resembling that of\r\nthe morning. The boats were drawn upon land in the usual manner, by\r\nwhich they were concealed from the observation of any passing up or down\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nThe Indian resorted to the same means by which he had caught the fish in\r\nthe morning and with equal success. They were rather smaller, but none\r\nthe less savory, either to man or brute. An hour sufficed to rest them\r\nall, and to give Shasta all the pleasure of his pipe that he wished,\r\nwhile Tim continued his after entering the canoe. Howard and Elwood made\r\nan essay with the paddle, but the result with the latter was that the\r\ninstant he so cautiously thrust it beneath the surface, it was suddenly\r\nwrung from his hand, and in an instant left a rod or two astern. This\r\nnecessitated a delay in order to pick it up, and the boys concluded to\r\nawait another time to perfect themselves in the art of managing an\r\nIndian canoe.\r\n\r\nIt was not until it was quite dark that they once more set foot upon\r\nland and kindled their fire. There was quite a strong wind blowing, and\r\nthe chill of the air appeared to indicate that it came from the snowy\r\npeaks of the Coast Range. Fully an hour was taken in gathering wood,\r\nsticks, broken limbs and branches, for they had concluded to keep it\r\nburning until morning.\r\n\r\nThe fire was kindled against the trunk of a giant sycamore, and as the\r\nflames waved up the shaggy bark the reflection upon the outstretched\r\nlimbs and neighboring trees gave them a weird appearance that made the\r\nboys gather close to the somber-hued Pah Utah as though conscious of his\r\nability to stand between them and evil.\r\n\r\nTim and Shasta were leisurely smoking their pipes, and Howard and Elwood\r\nwere conversing together in low tones of their homes and friends, when a\r\nquick bark from Terror, as he rose to his feet and looked in the\r\ndarkness, drew all eyes in one direction. A score of flashing eyes,\r\ngleaming teeth, lank, restless bodies and greedy jaws announced, that a\r\nnew danger threatened them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE WOLVERINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pah Utah was the only member of the party that did not manifest any\r\nalarm or excitement. Carelessly removing his pipe from his mouth, he\r\nturned his head, looked at the animals a moment, and then resumed\r\nsmoking, without giving utterance to a single sound or changing his\r\nposture in the least.\r\n\r\nTim O'Rooney, with an ejaculated prayer, caught up his rifle, and\r\nturning his back toward the fire, stood like a person driven at bay and\r\nwaiting to decide in his mind the best way to strike his last blow. In\r\nhis haste and alarm his pipe fell from his mouth and lay unheeded at his\r\nfeet. Shasta quietly picked it up, handed it to him, and motioned for\r\nhim to seat himself upon the ground again. Tim stared alternately at the\r\nanimals, the Indian and his pipe, and finally gathered the idea that no\r\nimminent danger threatened them.\r\n\r\nHoward and Elwood also held their rifles ready for it charge from the\r\ngrowling wolverines, for such they were, while the Newfoundland growled\r\nin turn, and glared defiantly at them. The intelligent brute appeared to\r\ncomprehend that it would not do for him to sally out and charge upon the\r\nenemy's works, but he stood ready to fight and die in the defense of his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't they attack us?\" asked Elwood, seeing that they didn't\r\nadvance nearer than a dozen feet.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know that wild animals are afraid of fire? That is what\r\nrestrains them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course! I didn't think of that. How fortunate that we gathered\r\nenough wood to last!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just look at Shasta! He doesn't even stop smoking!\"\r\n\r\n\"He must know there is no danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us try our guns upon them!\"\r\n\r\nThe proposal pleased both, especially as there was no fear but what they\r\ncould make every discharge tell. Each of them singled out two of the\r\nlargest wolverines, and fired their guns at the same instant. An\r\near-splitting clamor succeeded, and as the brutes scampered away in the\r\ndarkness two of their number were seen stretched out, quivering and\r\ndying.\r\n\r\nThe wolverine is an animal found in California which unites the\r\ncharacteristics of the bear, weasel, fox and wolf. It is sullen and\r\nferocious, and one of the most troublesome of the wood-denizens. When\r\nfirst seen it is apt to be mistaken for a small bear, or rather\r\nheavy-looking wolf. The sensuous neck and head bespeak the wolf and\r\nweasel nature, the sly persistency the fox, and the savage stubbornness\r\nthat of the bear; while a resemblance to all four can be seen in the\r\ngeneral contour, appearance and habits of the animal.\r\n\r\nAttracted, no doubt, by the smell of the cooking fish, a number of these\r\nbrutes had slyly gathered and crept to the camp, where, finding their\r\nprey protected by the fire, they proclaimed their furious disappointment\r\nby loud howls--half bark and half yell--springing hither and thither\r\namong each other, sometimes vaulting over each other's backs, and\r\ndarting as close to the bristling dog as their mortal dread of the fire\r\nwould permit.\r\n\r\nTerror stood on the outskirts of the camp, occasionally moving forward\r\ntoward the animals, as if to match his long white teeth and massive\r\nstrength against their glittering fangs and treacherous ferocity.\r\n\r\nWhen the two guns were discharged the rest disappeared as if a bombshell\r\nhad exploded in their midst; but scarcely a dozed seconds elapsed ere\r\nthey closed together again, fiercer and more clamorous, if possible,\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the boys had their guns reloaded, and they immediately\r\nrepeated their former proceeding with precisely the same result. At this\r\npoint a surprising occurrence came to pass. The dead wolverines were\r\npounced upon by their survivors and torn instantly to shreds, and even\r\ndevoured with as much avidity as if they were Terror and his human\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear of such a thing?\" asked Elwood, watching them in\r\ngreat amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I have read of wolves doing the same, even when one of their\r\nnumber was not killed but only wounded slightly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any animals that act in that manner deserve death; so let's send a few\r\nmore rifle-balls among them.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we keep this up for a few hours I don't see that there will be any\r\nleft, and we may rest in peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will keep on gathering until there are twice that number. If it\r\nwasn't for our fire we should have to take to the trees; and what, then,\r\nwould become of poor Terror?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will get into trouble as it is,\" said Howard, \"if we don't keep an\r\neye on him.\"\r\n\r\nThe dog had continued advancing closer to the wolverines, until there\r\nwas an imminent probability of a collision occurring between him and two\r\nof the largest, that sprung forward until they were within a few inches\r\nof him, when they darted back again to repeat the feint, seemingly with\r\nthe purpose of drawing the Newfoundland further toward their clutches.\r\n\r\nHoward spoke sharply to Terror, but he paid no heed to the call. The boy\r\nrepeated it with the same uselessness, and he was beginning to become\r\nseriously alarmed for his fate when Shasta laid down his pipe and rose\r\nto his feet. The eyes of the three were now centered upon him.\r\n\r\nThe Pah Utah left his gun and blanket upon the ground, so that his arms\r\nand breast, excepting a few ornaments, were bare. He then drew his keen\r\nhunting-knife and held it rigidly grasped in his right hand. Stooping\r\ndown, he caught a blazing brand with his left, swung it rapidly over his\r\nhead a few times to give it additional blaze, and then darted away like\r\na meteor directly among the wolverines. The latter scattered in greater\r\nterror than ever, but the Indian, instead of returning, actually\r\nfollowed them.\r\n\r\nThe brand could only be seen flitting among the trees, its flaming glare\r\ngiving a wild, unearthly appearance to the face and breast of the Savage\r\nas he sped swiftly in and out among the trunks and vegetation, like an\r\navenger bent on destroying the entire band.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest wolverines, in his wild fear, sprung so close to\r\nElwood that his tail whisked against him. Ere he could clear himself the\r\nIndian burst upon him, his iron arm flashed out with lightning-like\r\nswiftness, the wire-like fingers caught the brute by the neck, and the\r\nknife was buried so deep in his throat that when he was thrown back he\r\nfell limp and dead to the ground. After which Shasta sat down upon the\r\nground again, folded his blanket over his shoulders and appeared much\r\noccupied in contemplating the burning sticks before him.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Shasta, that was well done!\" exclaimed Tim in admiration. \"I very\r\nmuch doubt whether it could be excelled by your humble servant, the\r\nundersigned.\"\r\n\r\n\"I very much doubt it also,\" said Elwood. \"I shouldn't fancy chasing\r\nthose animals with a firebrand.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; if you should drop it or fall down unpleasant consequences might\r\nfollow.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys kept up their loading and firing among the wolverines until\r\nthey had slain over a dozen. But instead of diminishing, the number\r\ncontinued to increase till there must have been nearly two-score\r\ngrowling, snapping and snarling around the camp-fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nSHASTA'S HUMOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe camp-fire was kept burning unremittingly until morning, and the\r\nwolverines as unceasingly continued their clamor, so that none of the\r\nparties secured a moment's sleep. The boys were signaled several times\r\nby Shasta to lie down, but they were too unaccustomed to such sights and\r\nsounds to permit them to do so with anything like peace; so they used\r\ntheir rifles upon the savage animals until prudence advised them to\r\nhusband their ammunition until they had better use for it.\r\n\r\nTim O'Rooney was fully as restless as they. He was in continual dread\r\nthat some of the treacherous animals would steal up behind him and\r\nfasten their teeth so securely in him that they could not be shaken off.\r\nThis uneasiness caused him ever to be shifting his position, now on one\r\nside the fire, now on the other--springing suddenly upward as though he\r\nalready felt the nip of their fangs.\r\n\r\nThe Pah Utah, at this time, displayed a grim humor, so exceptional with\r\nhis people, as to be almost incredible, except to the boys who were\r\nwitnesses to it. Believing such traits should be encouraged among all\r\naborigines as an antidote for their melancholy dispositions, it gives us\r\ngreat pleasure to record it, and it will afford us far greater enjoyment\r\nto testify regarding any other such performances that may come under our\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nTim was standing with his back toward the fire, and his hands,\r\ncarelessly crossed behind him. He was intently watching the quarrelsome\r\nanimals, and all thoughts of attack in the rear had for the time\r\ndeparted. Shasta leaned silently forward and lifted a small brand to\r\nrelight his pipe, which had gone out some time before. As he was passing\r\nit back to the embers the red coal just grazed one of Tim's fingers,\r\nwhile at the same instant the Indian imitated the snarl of the wolverine\r\nso exactly that the follow was sure he was seized, and he made the most\r\nagile leap of his life.\r\n\r\n\"Murther! murther! pull him off, Mr. Shasta, catch hold of him!\"\r\nexclaimed the affrighted Irishman, springing wildly on every side of the\r\nfire, and striking with blind fierceness at the imaginary brute in his\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nHoward and Elwood laughed till the tears rolled down their cheeks. They\r\nhad seen Shasta's trick and they could therefore appreciate it. Never a\r\nsmile lit up the grim face of the Pah Utah. He continued leisurely\r\nsmoking, his keen black eyes looking dreamily into the fire, as if lost\r\nin some pleasant reverie.\r\n\r\nBut what of that? Who can doubt, that he laughed internally full as\r\nheartily as the youngsters? Who can tell what surges, and waves, and\r\nripples of laughter went through and through him, until his whole being\r\nwas absorbed in merriment?\r\n\r\nFinally Tim's terror passed away and he became comparatively quiet.\r\n\r\n\"Worrah! worrah!\" he exclaimed, panting from his severe exertions. \"What\r\na narra 'scape I had.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he really bite you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bite me! Didn't ye see him fasten his teeth in me and hang on till I\r\nshuk him off?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I didn't observe him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Git out wid ye nonsense. But I felt him sure and it was meself that\r\nthought once he'd pull me off into the darkness and make me a prey to\r\nthe beasts there--that I did think, did I.\"\r\n\r\n\"No danger,\" remarked Howard, as he and his cousin were unable to\r\nrestrain their laughter.\r\n\r\n\"What be ye spalpeens laughing at?\" indignantly demanded the Irishman.\r\n\r\n\"But, Tim, are you sure you were not mistaken? We saw nothing of the\r\nkind,\" pursued Howard.\r\n\r\nThe fellow looked too full of indignation to speak.\r\n\r\n\"What is getting into your heads? Ye saam to be losing your sinses\r\nintirely.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I can say I saw none of them touch you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you was blind,\" was the indignant retort. \"Ye harrd him sing out\r\nat me heels, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, we heard them all the time, as we do now; but the one you\r\nimagined so close may have been a dozen feet distant.\"\r\n\r\n\"_But he bit me!_\" was the triumphant reply to this.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us see the mark!\"\r\n\r\nThe boys arose and walked up to their friend, who bent over the fire,\r\nheld his hand close to his face, turning it over and over and\r\nscrutinizing it with the closest attention. Concluding he was mistaken,\r\nhe exchanged it for its fellow, which was subjected to an equally severe\r\ncross-examination. Still nothing confirmatory of his words could be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe amazed Irishman now held up both his hands, turning them over and\r\nover and pressing them close to his face.\r\n\r\n\"Do yees saa anything?\" he abruptly asked, thrusting them toward the\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nThey went through the form of a search for a scratch or a bite, but\r\ndeclared themselves unable to discover any.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you feel any pain?\" asked Howard.\r\n\r\n\"I thought I did,\" replied Tim, with a serious, puzzled look upon his\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\"In what part of your body?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whisht!\"\r\n\r\nHe motioned to them to maintain silence, while he closed his eyes and\r\nwaited for some evidence of the pain he had so sharply felt a few\r\nminutes before. As he stood thus, he stealthily brought each hand around\r\nin front of his face and subjected them to the same examination.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his eye sparkled, and he held out his left:\r\n\r\n\"That's the hand!\" he exclaimed exultingly.\r\n\r\n\"Let's see?\" asked the boys, stepping up to him.\r\n\r\n\"Yees'll find it somewhere there, if yees'll take the throuble to\r\nexamine it closely.\"\r\n\r\nThey did so, but declared themselves unable to find the wound.\r\n\r\nTim finally showed a small red spot upon one of the fingers, which he\r\naffirmed was where the cruel tooth did bite him.\r\n\r\n\"That cannot be, for the skin is not broken.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it faals as if the same had been bit off.\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks more like a burn,\" added Elwood.\r\n\r\nTim now turned around and looked at the Pah Utah. The latter was smoking\r\nhis pipe, as if unconscious of the presence of any being or animal near\r\nhim. Perhaps they were mistaken, but Howard and Elwood always affirmed\r\nthat they detected a twitching at the corners of his mouth, as if he\r\nwere ready to explode with laughter.\r\n\r\nBut if it was that, it was nothing more, and it manifested itself in no\r\nother manner. Tim gazed fixedly at him a moment, and then turning to the\r\nboys, asked in a whisper:\r\n\r\n_\"But didn't ye hear it snarrl at meself?\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nAGAIN ON THE RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Newfoundland, Terror, occasioned more apprehension to his friends\r\nthan did anything else. They came to see that no personal danger\r\nthreatened so long as the fire kept burning, and as there was an\r\nabundance of fuel, this settled that point; but the dog grew enraged at\r\nthe furious uproar, which drove away all sleep, and appeared to give him\r\nfear that the entire party were in danger.\r\n\r\nSeveral times, when some of the wolverines came too close, he made a\r\nspring at them, and they snapped back. But the good sense of the dog\r\nkept him from venturing among the ravenous brutes, and they in turn were\r\nin too much dread of the fire to do more than spring at him and then as\r\nquickly dart back again.\r\n\r\nIt was an impressive sight and one which could never be forgotten. The\r\nlarge, noble Newfoundland, standing out in relief against the glare of\r\nthe camp-fire, his eyes aflame with anger, every muscle braced, the jaws\r\nparted and his eyes fixed upon the dark bodies plunging over each other,\r\ndarting forward and back again, snapping, snarling and furious; the Pah\r\nUtah stretched upon the ground, deliberately smoking, all unheedful of\r\nthe deafening clangor and the savage brutes that sometimes approached\r\nalmost within striking distance; the two boys, so close to the fire that\r\nthey were often scorched by it, gazing at the animals with an expression\r\nof half fear and half wonder, starting when one of them came unusually\r\nnear, and now and then sending the fatal bullet among them; the nervous\r\nIrishman, darting hither and thither, taking great care that the fire\r\nwas kept fully burning; all these, we say, made a scene impressive in\r\nthe highest degree.\r\n\r\nTerror, when sharply spoken to, would withdraw from his dangerous\r\nproximity to the wolverines, but almost immediately he stepped forward\r\nto the same spot he first occupied, and his obedience to the commands of\r\nthe boys was so sullen and ill-natured that they forebore speaking to\r\nhim except when his safety seemed absolutely to demand it.\r\n\r\nAt times there was an interruption in the clamor, but the wolverines did\r\nnot appear to relax their vigilance in the least. It was as if they had\r\ndetermined to make their evening meal upon the party though they were\r\nforced to wait until morning for it. During these intervals of\r\ncomparative silence our friends gained opportunity for the exchange of a\r\nfew words, but they were often compelled to shout at the top of their\r\nvoices to make themselves heard.\r\n\r\nDuring one of these lulls Elwood spoke to Howard.\r\n\r\n\"What will take place in the morning, when these creatures are not\r\nafraid of our fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think they will go away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so: but we are not so sure of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shasta will no doubt turn the whole thing over in his mind, and be\r\nprompt enough to act when the danger comes. I suppose we can take to our\r\ncanoes and give them the slip in that manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; the Indian appears to have rather a contemptible opinion of them.\r\nHe scarcely heeds their wrangling.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not so timid as we and Tim are; but he doesn't forget to look at\r\nthem once in a while, so as not to forget what they are doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are a savage set of animals. How angry Terror is! Don't you notice\r\nthat they are trying to entice him to venture out a little nearer them?\r\nThey hate him more than all of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can see it in their manner. If they can once get hold of him they\r\nwill tear him to shreds.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they will catch him, too, if he isn't careful. He is so surly and\r\ncross himself that it is dangerous to touch or speak to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't afford to lose him. We must watch, and if he gets too close to\r\nany of them, why, all we shall have to do is to crack them over, and\r\ngive the others warning to keep their distance.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they were speaking a huge wolverine darted close enough to strike\r\nTerror. Instantly the two closed and rolled upon the ground in the\r\nfierce death struggle. Over and over, snapping, snarling, growling,\r\nbiting, scratching with lightning-like fierceness, now one below and\r\nthen the other, and finally the dog on top.\r\n\r\nThe conflict was as short as it was furious. The massive jaws of the\r\nNewfoundland closed on the throat of his antagonist and his teeth met\r\nthrough his windpipe. There they stuck for a minute, and when he relaxed\r\nhis hold it was all over with the reckless animal.\r\n\r\nStill it would have fared ill with the dog but for Shasta, for the other\r\nwolverines would have sprung upon him and destroyed him before he could\r\nhave escaped. At the moment the two closed the Indian darted forward,\r\nseized a brand and flourished it over the combatants. This so terrified\r\nthe others that they kept their distance until the conqueror resumed his\r\nplace in triumph by the fire.\r\n\r\nThis encounter proved it lesson to both the dog and the wolverines. The\r\nlatter appeared to comprehend the disadvantage under which they were\r\nplaced, while Terror, having had a taste of their mettle, was satisfied\r\nfor the time, and kept a safe position further away from the brutes that\r\nwere so eager to fasten their teeth in him.\r\n\r\nIt was now verging toward morning, and the Pah Utah looked about him as\r\nif he were going to make his preparations for moving. He looked toward\r\nthe raging creatures, still fierce and furious, and then glanced at the\r\ncanoes drawn up within a few feet of the camp-fire, and pointed toward\r\nthem and the river.\r\n\r\nFortunately but a few feet intervened between their present position and\r\nthe stream, so that the latter was easy of access in case it should\r\nbecome necessary to retreat before the wolverines. Still the fire did\r\nnot protect this enough to make it a safe undertaking in their present\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nShasta picked up several blazing sticks, and carrying them to the\r\nwater's edge, placed them together and covered them with some dry\r\nbrush-wood. They speedily fanned themselves into a flame, and the\r\ngathering brutes withdrew and offered a fine approach to the river.\r\n\r\nThe Indian's next proceeding was to launch the two boats. This was done\r\neasily and without difficulty. The blankets and guns were placed within,\r\nand then motioned for the dog to follow; but Terror did not seem\r\ndisposed to leave his present quarters. Perhaps the idea worked its way\r\ninto his shaggy head that it savored too much of deserting his friends,\r\nor it may be that he still coveted a taste for another collision with\r\nthe audacious animals that had pressed him so sorely.\r\n\r\nOur brave soldier boys, who abhor bloodshed from a principle, still have\r\na love for the wild abandon of camp life, and many a one looks back with\r\na sigh to the rough experiences which we all pray may never come again.\r\nSo it may be the Newfoundland, naturally peaceful, having had his blood\r\nfairly roused by his tussle and triumph, yet longed for more of victory.\r\n\r\nFinally Howard and Elwood took their seats, and Tim O'Rooney followed;\r\nthen Terror, casting one reluctant look behind him, jumped into the boat\r\nand lay down in his usual position; and so, at length, they all were\r\nembarked in safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nA HALT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was just growing light as the two canoes shoved out in the river and\r\nresumed their journey. The rapacious wolverines, enraged at the loss of\r\ntheir expected prey, followed them to the very edge of the stream, where\r\ntheir ear-splitting clamor grew more furious than ever. At one time,\r\nindeed, it looked us though they were about to jump into the water and\r\nswim out to them; and both the boys looked inquiringly at the face of\r\nthe Pah Utah. The stolid, indifferent expression that they there saw\r\nrelieved them, and they withdrew all further thought regarding the\r\ntroublesome animals.\r\n\r\nShasta had loosened the connection between the two boats--not, perhaps,\r\nthat he was unwilling to carry them also along, but because he judged it\r\nwas time that the party learned to navigate for themselves.\r\n\r\nTim O'Rooney grasped the paddle, and his handling of it showed no\r\nordinary skill. He had greatly improved upon his performance of\r\nyesterday, and kept his position slightly in the rear of the other\r\ncanoe, whose owner, as a matter of course, timed his speed to that of\r\nhis pupil.\r\n\r\nWhen the Irishman was tired he passed the paddle to Howard, who had been\r\ncarefully studying the \"style\" of Shasta, and whose efforts were modeled\r\nafter his. Practice alone can make perfect, no matter if the theory in\r\nabsolutely so. The mind may hold the exact idea, and may send the\r\nprecise message through the nerves to the muscles, but the latter must\r\nmake a good many trials before they can carry out orders with exactness.\r\n\r\nAnd so the boy, although, as he believed, he imitated exactly the manner\r\nof their dusky friend, was not long in finding that the paddle was by no\r\nmeans as obedient. The reason was that the delicate play of the iron\r\nmuscles of the Pah Utah could not be seen. They had done this thing so\r\noften that it became a matter of course with them.\r\n\r\nBut having started upon right principles, by the time the boy was so\r\nexhausted that he could not move his arms, he could see that he had\r\nimproved, or as the sovereign people say, \"he was getting the knack of\r\nit.\" It was now Elwood's turn, and he caught the paddle with all the\r\nenthusiasm which might be expected in a youngster who had been\r\nimpatiently waiting to take part in some game.\r\n\r\nBy the time Elwood needed rest, Tim O'Rooney was ready, and so the\r\npaddle did unceasing work, each member having all the time necessary for\r\nrest, until after they had been to work some hours, the boys found their\r\narms remained tired, and a longer cessation needed.\r\n\r\nShasta seemed to look upon these essays of his friends with no little\r\npleasure. He watched their movements all the time, and a horrible\r\nsuspicion once entered the head of Tim O'Rooney that he saw him come\r\nvery near smiling. Whether there were any grounds for this suspicion\r\nprobably will never be known, unless the Pah Utah takes it into his head\r\nto write and tell us.\r\n\r\nShasta remained a few feet in advance, his back being placed toward the\r\nprow of his own boat. This relative position--and our \"pale faced\"\r\nfriends, it may be said, labored savagely--was kept by him without any\r\neffort. Now and then he touched the point of his paddle, but there was\r\nscarcely a ripple. It was as a fish is sometimes seen to move through\r\nthe water with the slightest quiver of its fins.\r\n\r\nWhen all three of our friends were used up, red in the face, panting and\r\nsighing for a chance to take a good long rest, a tiny island came in\r\nview round a bend in the river, and to their joy they saw Shasta fix his\r\neye upon it and then head his canoe toward the point. Cheered by the\r\nprospect, they renewed their work with greater ardor, and in a few\r\nmoments the boats buried their points in the luxuriant undergrowth along\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nThe island was quite small, and offered no inducements in the way of\r\ngame, unless some animal in crossing the river had paused to rest itself\r\nand make an exploration of the place. This was scarcely to be expected,\r\nand none of the party based any hopes upon it.\r\n\r\nAfter the inmates of the large canoe had stepped upon shore, Shasta sent\r\nhis backward into the river again by a sweep of his paddle, and headed\r\nfor the eastern bank, shooting over the surface with amazing speed. His\r\nmovements were watched with interest and some surprise.\r\n\r\n\"What can it mean?\" asked Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he is going to leave us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think he would do it in that manner. He will make an elaborate\r\ngood-by for us, for we are getting to understand each other quite well\r\nby means of signs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrah now!\" exclaimed Tim O'Rooney, \"didn't ye saa that he was\r\ndisgusted wid our paddling and kaaping him back, and has gone out jist\r\nthat he may enj'y the pleasure of shtretching his arms in the\r\nowld-fashioned manner, as Father O'Shaughnessy said when he tipped over\r\nhis brother?\"\r\n\r\nThis may have satisfied the Irishman, but hardly the boys. It did not\r\nlook reasonable to them that the Indian, having just finished three\r\ntimes the amount of work performed by each, was in so great need of\r\nadditional exercise that he must abandon his friends and paddle off over\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\n\"I think he is going to hunt for fish,\" said Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"But he could have caught them without going to land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not. I noticed yesterday that he went where there was a sort of\r\neddy, and you see he can't find that very well unless it is close by\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\nHoward pointed to the lower end of the island:\r\n\r\n\"What better place could he find than that? It is just the spot to catch\r\nfish.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Shasta's canoe had reached the bank, but instead of landing\r\nhe turned the prow down stream, and slowly glided along as if in quest\r\nof something. This to Tim O'Rooney was proof of the truth of his\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\n\"What did I tell yees? The thrip to shore was not enough, and he's\r\ntaking a wee turn further.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is looking for a good fishing ground,\" affirmed Howard. \"If it were\r\nanything else he would not go so slowly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, see! he has stopped?\"\r\n\r\nAs Elwood spoke the Pah Utah rose in his canoe and stepped ashore. He\r\nstooped and employed himself a moment with the canoe and then\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\"It cannot be that he has left us,\" said Elwood, in considerable alarm.\r\n\r\n\"No; I think he is hunting for game.\"\r\n\r\nThis seemed very reasonable, and the party waited patiently for his\r\nreturn. No personal danger to himself could be expected, as he could not\r\nbe approached undiscovered by any hostile white man, and being an Indian\r\nhe could have no cause to fear anything from his own race.\r\n\r\nStill there was a vague misgiving that everything was not right--that\r\nsomething unusual would be the result of this separation--and each\r\nmember of the little party awaited, with more anxiety than he would have\r\nconfessed, some evidence of the intention of the Pah Utah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nEXIT SHASTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three whites were still gazing toward the eastern shore, intently\r\nlooking for some sign, or listening to some sound which might tell\r\nsomething regarding Shasta, when they were startled by a loud whirring\r\nor buzzing overhead, and looking up saw a large bird passing within a\r\nfew feet of them--so close that its claws could be seen curled up\r\nagainst its body, as it made a sudden sweep to the right, frightened at\r\nits near approach to its human enemies.\r\n\r\n\"Shoot it!\" called out Elwood to Howard. \"My gun isn't loaded, and it\r\nwill make us a good breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nBut the bird, whatever it was, did not choose to wait until the heavy\r\nrifle could be brought to bear upon it; and by the time Howard had\r\nfairly got the idea through his head, it was skimming away over the\r\ncountry toward the Coast Range.\r\n\r\nBut a sharper eye and an unerring aim was leveled against it, and as\r\nthey were watching its flight it suddenly turned over and over, its\r\ngreat wings going like the arms of a windmill as it dropped swiftly to\r\nthe earth; and, as it disappeared in the trees and undergrowth, the\r\ncrack of a rifle came across the intervening space.\r\n\r\n\"That was Shasta!\" exclaimed Elwood in delight.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, we might have known what he was after. He thinks we do not\r\nadmire fish as a steady diet and has gone after fowl for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know about that,\" said Elwood, who sometimes seemed to\r\nalternate with Howard in his knowledge of the ways of the wood. \"I can't\r\nsee that there was any more chance of seeing birds there than upon the\r\nisland. That same fowl passed closer to us than it did to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" laughed Howard, \"that he was hunting after game of some\r\nkind, and had no idea of shooting the bird until it passed so near him\r\nthat he saw it was quite the thing we needed, and so he toppled it\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me views intirely,\" assented Tim. \"I agraas wid both of yees.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments later the Pah Utah appeared with the bird in his hand, and\r\nflinging it into the canoe quickly paddled back to the island. His bird\r\nproved to be a species of wild goose, that seemed to have strayed from\r\nits flock and gone wandering through the Salinas Valley at this season\r\nof the year ultimately to fall before the rifle of Shasta.\r\n\r\nOur friends were in ecstasies over their prospective meal. The Indian\r\ndisplayed the same skill in dressing the bird that he did in preparing\r\nthe fish. The feathers were quickly twitched off, and the dry driftwood\r\npiled upon the upper end of the island was the best fuel they could have\r\nhad for the purpose. When done, it was \"done brown,\" and to a turn; and\r\nto the famishing travelers nothing could have been more savory and\r\nluscious.\r\n\r\nThe truth of it was, the boys found that this kind of life was agreeing\r\nwith them amazingly. Their appetites were fierce, their sleep sound, and\r\na feeling of perfect health diffused itself through their glowing\r\nframes, such as they had never known before. Their exposure to the night\r\nair troubled them at first, but they soon recovered from it and enjoyed\r\n\"camping out\" as thoroughly as did old campaigners.\r\n\r\nIt was a very good thing, it is true, for a while; but don't let any\r\nboys get the idea of following their example, unless they are compelled\r\nin precisely the same manner to do so. If any youngster imagines he has\r\nformed true ideas of distant countries from the narratives of adventures\r\nwhich he may have read, he will find himself most woefully mistaken.\r\nNever think of traveling until you are a married man, and by that time\r\nyou will have made up your mind to be sensible and stay at home.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was finished, and their appetites satisfied, the Pah Utah,\r\ninstead of immediately embarking, walked to the lower end of the island,\r\nand stood for some time apparently examining some sign further down the\r\nriver. Following the direction of his eyes, our friends could see\r\nnothing unusual until Elwood detected something in the air on the\r\nwestern bank which at first resembled a light cloud, but which they\r\nimagined might be caused by a camp-fire.\r\n\r\nWhatever it was that attracted the attention of Shasta he took but a few\r\nmoments to decide regarding it. Going again to his canoe, he entered it\r\nwithout a word or sign, and paddled away at his swiftest rate straight\r\ntoward it, while his companions watched the proceeding with as much\r\ninterest as in the preceding case.\r\n\r\nThe camp appeared fully a half-mile distant, and it took but a short\r\ntime for the Indian to reach a point opposite, when he sprung lightly\r\nashore and disappeared with his usual celerity.\r\n\r\n\"He is cautious,\" remarked Elwood. \"He doesn't wish us to undertake to\r\npass it unless he is sure there will be no trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"A sinsible young man!\" asserted Tim. \"His parents have the best raison\r\nfor faaling proud of so promising a young gintleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so have we.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments elapsed, when the Pah Utah reappeared and came back as\r\nrapidly as he went.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he did upon reaching the island was again to fasten the\r\nboats together, and then motion to the three to enter. This, of course,\r\nthey did without delay, and took their usual positions.\r\n\r\nBut Shasta was not satisfied. He told them, in his manner, to lie down;\r\nand not until the three had so arranged themselves as to be invisible\r\nfrom both shores, did he dip his paddle and resume his journey.\r\n\r\n\"This means danger,\" said Elwood. \"He doesn't wish any one to know we\r\nare in the boats.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we must be sure and obey him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's aisy doing, as my brother used to say whin his wife tould him, in\r\nher gintle manner, by the help of her broomstick, to go to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, Elwood, you are close to Terror, see that he doesn't let his\r\ncuriosity got the better of his judgment.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pah Utah was satisfied, and now began plying his paddle. It was\r\ndifficult for the three so to govern their curiosity as not to peep over\r\nthe side of the canoe; but there were good reasons for their not doing\r\nso, and they scarcely moved a limb for the next hour.\r\n\r\nThey had gone but a little way when Terror raised his head and uttered a\r\nslight bark; but a word from Elwood quieted him. Finally, Shasta paused\r\nand uttered a guttural sound in his own tongue, which was taken as\r\npermission for them to rise.\r\n\r\nAs they did so, they looked behind. The dim smoke ascending in the\r\nsummer sky was seen far behind, and between it and them the Salinas made\r\nanother bend, so that they had no cause to fear observation from that\r\nparty at least.\r\n\r\nShasta again disconnected the two canoes--an act which did not surprise\r\nthem; but his next proceeding astonished them a good deal.\r\n\r\nReaching across the boats, he shook hands with them all, at the same\r\ntime muttering a word or two to each.\r\n\r\n\"He is going to leave us,\" said Elwood, with an air of disappointment.\r\n\r\n\"He has good reason for doing so, but I am afraid it will be bad for\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Adieu, Mr. Shasta, adieu!\" said Tim O'Rooney, with considerable\r\nfeeling. \"You've done us a good turn and we'll not forget you. If yez\r\never drifts into San Francisco, give us a call.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian motioned to them to proceed, and using his paddle with his\r\nextraordinary skill, he sped up the river toward the camp-fire, and in a\r\nvery short time vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE WESTERN SHORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe departure of Shasta gave rise to all manner of doubt and\r\nspeculation. None of them believed he meditated bidding the party\r\ngood-by until he went through the ceremony of shaking hands. This\r\nsettled the matter, and they could have no cause for hope of seeing him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"That must have been a party of his people,\" said Howard, \"or he would\r\nnot have taken the pains to help us out of sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, he has done us good service,\" replied Elwood. \"I don't\r\nknow what would have become of us but for him.\"\r\n\r\nThey had not yet begun using their paddle, but were drifting with the\r\ncurrent, debating upon their course of action.\r\n\r\n\"I think I understand why he left us,\" added Howard, after a moment's\r\npause.\r\n\r\nTim and Elwood looked up in his face.\r\n\r\n\"I think we have passed through most of the danger, and he thought we\r\nwere just as safe without him as with him. Don't you see, Elwood, that\r\nwe have come a good ways down the river, and we must be near some\r\nsettlement. I think there is a place called Soledad somewhere along this\r\nriver, but whether on the eastern or western bank I cannot tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a good ways off, I should say fifty miles, and is on the western\r\nbank.\"\r\n\r\n\"How comes it that _you_ are so well informed?\" asked Howard, repeating\r\nthe question that had been asked him by his cousin when on the steamer.\r\n\r\n\"It is only accidentally that I know that. A few weeks ago I was\r\ncomparing an old and new geography and noticed what different views they\r\ngave of the western part of our country. The old maps had the\r\nBuenaventura so wrong in every particular that I learned considerable\r\nabout the true one, which you know is called Salinas by most people.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we are very careful, I think we can get home without trouble; but\r\nalthough there must be white people--settlers and miners--in these\r\nparts, still they are so scattered that we are less likely to see them\r\nthan we are the Indians.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boys,\" said Tim O'Rooney, who had not let his pipe go out since\r\nmorning. \"Shall I give yez some good advice?\"\r\n\r\nBoth expressed their eagerness to receive it.\r\n\r\n\"There bees plenty of the rid gintlemen yet in this counthry, and we\r\nhaven't got beyant them. If we goes paddling in this canoe when the sun\r\nis shining overhead, some of 'em will see us, and if we don't put into\r\nshore they'll put out after us--that they will.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it that you propose, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"That we turns the night into day, and slaaps and smokes and meditates\r\nby sunlight, and does our traveling by moonlight, or what is bether,\r\nwithout any light at all.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposal suited the boys exactly. It was so plainly dictated by\r\ncommon sense that the wonder was they had not thought of it long before.\r\nElwood took the paddle in his hand and held it poised.\r\n\r\n\"Which way--east or west?\"\r\n\r\nHoward pointed to the left bank.\r\n\r\n\"That is the side where _they_ are,\" replied Elwood, referring to the\r\nIndian party they had passed.\r\n\r\n\"And where _he_ is,\" meaning their good friend, the Pah Utah.\r\n\r\n\"To the left--to the left,\" said Tim. \"Didn't I git into the worst\r\nthrouble of me life--always barring the repulse me Bridget give me--by\r\nhunting in them parts?\"\r\n\r\nElwood delayed no longer, but plied the oars with a dexterity that\r\nshowed his experience had not been lost upon him.\r\n\r\n\"You understand it quite well,\" said Howard approvingly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but my arms ache terribly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! here we are.\"\r\n\r\nThe prow of the canoe moved as silently and easily into the undergrowth\r\nas if it were water, and our friends at a step passed from every portion\r\nof it to dry land.\r\n\r\nAs they intended remaining in their present quarters until darkness,\r\nthey took some pains to select a suitable place. They finally hit upon a\r\nspot, on an incline of the river bank, and about a dozen yards distant.\r\nHere the grass was green and velvety, and the wood so thick that they\r\nhad little fear of discovery, unless by some who had seen them land and\r\ntook the trouble to hunt them out.\r\n\r\nIt was about noon when they landed, and as they had all spent a wakeful\r\nnight, their first proceeding was so to arrange themselves as to enjoy a\r\nquiet sleep. Terror was placed on duty as sentinel, and all lay down\r\nwith a sense of security to which they had been strangers in a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the boys were the first to awake, doing so almost at the same\r\nmoment. They saw by the sun that the afternoon was about half gone, but\r\nthey were not troubled from hunger, as their morning meal may be said to\r\nhave been their midday one, and had been one of those royal ones whose\r\nmemory is apt to linger a long time with us, especially if we are boys.\r\n\r\n\"This is tiresome,\" said Elwood, yawning and stretching his limbs, \"let\r\nus take a tramp of discovery.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposal suited Howard, although prudence told him to remain where\r\nhe was and keep his friend with him. But the restraint was so irksome\r\nthat he was all too willing a listener to the persuasions of his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"I noticed there was quite a high range of hills just back of us,\" added\r\nElwood. \"Let's take a look at them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it prudent?\" and Howard only repeated audibly the question that his\r\nconscience had just asked him.\r\n\r\n\"Prudent? Of course it is, if we only take good care of ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we awake Tim before we go?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; he will sleep until to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must leave Terror to watch him then, for it wouldn't do for him to\r\nlie alone and asleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not.\"\r\n\r\nThe Newfoundland, which had risen to his feet, was told to remain on\r\nguard, and the boys started off on a ramble that was to be a most\r\neventful one to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE RAMBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the restraint the boys had undergone, cramped in the canoe, and\r\nnot daring to wander out of sight of their camp-fire when upon shore,\r\nthere was a delicious relief in rambling through the woods. The clear,\r\npure air that was dry and cool in the shadow of the forest, the\r\nundulating, charming scenery, the novel look that rested upon all they\r\nsaw--these possessed a charm to our young friends which they hardly\r\ncould have resisted, even if they had the will to do so; but when we say\r\nthat after starting forth scarcely a thought of their imprudence entered\r\ntheir heads, it was but natural that they should find themselves led\r\nmuch further away than was either wise or consistent with the resolves\r\nwith which they left their friends, Tim and Terror.\r\n\r\nThey took no notice of the direction they were following, nor of the\r\ndistance they had gone, until near the middle of the afternoon Howard\r\nabruptly paused and asked, with a look of alarm:\r\n\r\n\"Elwood, what have we done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? What is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must be a mile off from Tim, and it will be dark before we can get\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\n\"O! I think not. You know we have walked very slowly, and we can hurry\r\nwhen we take it into our heads to return.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you know the way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. Don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"What course must we follow?\"\r\n\r\nElwood pointed to the northwest, which, while it was not far from their\r\ngeneral course, was by no means the proper one by which to rejoin their\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"How strange!\" said Howard. \"It seems to me that yonder is the point\r\nfrom which we started.\"\r\n\r\nAnd _he_ pointed nearly due west, just as wrong as he could possibly be.\r\n\r\n\"You are wrong,\" said Elwood positively. \"I am sure of the right way.\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't dispute over it,\" replied his companion, with some sadness,\r\n\"for it is very doubtful if either of us is right.\"\r\n\r\n\"All we have to do then, is to hunt for the river and follow that up\r\nuntil we find Tim sound asleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yea; but how is the river to be found? To you it lies in one place, and\r\nto me in another.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can prove that you are wrong, and,\" laughed Elwood, \"that I am,\r\ntoo, although I was never right.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sun sets in the west, and notice where it is.\"\r\n\r\nHoward now opened his eyes in amazement. He would have been sure that it\r\nwas going down in the other part of the sky; but the proof before his\r\neyes was irrefragable.\r\n\r\n\"It must be,\" he replied. \"We have been 'turned round.' Just as when we\r\nleft the wharf at New York. I was below when the steamer came out, and\r\nso long as New York was in sight I was sure it lay in the wrong place.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, how bad even that makes it! We cannot reach the river before dark,\r\nand we shall not know whether we am a mile above or below where Tim is\r\nsleeping.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we go straight for the river, I think it likely that we shall come\r\nmuch nearer him than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be, but how are we to tell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, if we don't find him by night, we can fire oft our guns and call\r\nto him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And bring a party of the savages down upon us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be if there are any in the neighborhood, but we shall have to\r\nrun the risk.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the boys were fully impressed with their want of discretion\r\nand with the urgent necessity of making all haste back to the river.\r\n\r\n\"Let us keep our thoughts about us,\" said Howard, \"for we have been\r\nwithout them long enough. Now, the Salinas River runs very nearly north\r\nand south, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"This portion of it does.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must go as nearly east as we can, and let's be off.\"\r\n\r\nTurning their backs upon the sun, they began retracing their steps; but\r\nthey had journeyed scarce half an hour when they found themselves near a\r\nrange of hills, which they were sure they had not passed through, and\r\ndid not remember to have seen.\r\n\r\n\"What does this mean?\" asked Howard, still more alarmed. \"We never have\r\nbeen near these.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they not the hills we noticed just us we were about starting?\"\r\n\r\n\"They cannot be;--these are larger, have not half as much wood upon\r\nthem. I tell you, Elwood, there is one thing sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what you mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n_\"We are lost!\"_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"We are lost.\"]\r\n\r\n\"You are right. We may find Tim again, but we are going to have trouble\r\nto do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen! He may call to us.\"\r\n\r\nThey stopped walking find held their breath, but not a sound broke the\r\nsolemn stillness, save a faint, hollow roar--whether the deep murmur\r\nthat is always heard in a great forest, or the sound of the distant\r\nPacific Ocean they could not tell.\r\n\r\n\"No; he is asleep yet,\" said Elwood. \"If he would only wake up he would\r\nshout to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus you see, if we shoot our guns, the chances are that _he_ will not\r\nhear it, while it may be the means of bringing to us the very ones we\r\nare so anxious to keep away.\"\r\n\r\nSo they concluded not to fire their rifles for the present.\r\n\r\n\"But these hills,\" continued Howard, \"they don't extend in any great\r\ndirection either north or south. The question now is, shall we pass\r\naround the northern or southern end?\"\r\n\r\n\"What difference will it make?\"\r\n\r\n\"All the difference in the world. If Tim is to the south of us, and we\r\npass around that way, I think we shall find him without much hunting,\r\nwhile if we take the wrong course it will be night before we can get\r\nanywhere near him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" replied Elwood. \"We shall have to guess at it. But, hold!\" he\r\nexclaimed, with sparkling eyes. \"You go one way and I will another!\"\r\n\r\nHoward shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"There is too much risk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. The distance is short, and we can whistle to each other\r\nevery few minutes. Then, you know, as we shall be looking for each\r\nother, we cannot lose ourselves in these still woods. The minute I get\r\nsight of the river I can tell whether we are above or below Tim.\"\r\n\r\nHoward would not consent at first, but his cousin set forth the\r\nadvantages of the plan so eloquently that he finally agreed. Arranging\r\ntheir signals and manner of proceeding, the boys, therefore, separated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nBACK TO CAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hill which the boys proposed to pass around was about a quarter of a\r\nmile in length and but slightly less in breadth--much greater than\r\neither of them suspected when they set out. It rose like a peak to the\r\nheight of several hundred feet, as if it were an offshoot from the main\r\nridge of hills, left to flourish by itself.\r\n\r\nHoward walked slowly along, after glancing back at his cousin until the\r\nintervening wood concealed him from view, when he gave a short, sharp\r\nwhistle, which was immediately answered. Then, appreciating the\r\nnecessity of haste, he quickened his footsteps.\r\n\r\nAs he advanced the hills assumed proportions of which he had not\r\ndreamed, and that raised in his mind strong doubts as to the wisdom of\r\nseparating from his companion. He would not have done it had not the\r\nlatter urged him so. Misgivings now arose in the mind of the boy. He\r\nlooked upon his duty as that of restraining and tempering Elwood's\r\nimpulsiveness. He had done so several times to his manifest advantage;\r\nbut on this day, as Howard looked back, it really appeared as if he had\r\nbidden good-by to his senses. Their separation from Tim was almost\r\ncriminal in its foolishness, and yet he had scarcely raised an\r\nobjection; and now, was not the last proceeding still more imprudent? As\r\nit stood, the three members of the little party who should never have\r\nbeen out of each other's sight, were now a good distance from each\r\nother, and that, too, when in a hostile country.\r\n\r\nFrom these rather sad reflections Howard was roused by the faint,\r\nechoing whistle of Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"He is all right,\" thought he, feeling much relieved, as he placed his\r\nfingers to his mouth and returned the whistle. \"We are both now passing\r\naround the hill, so that we cannot get further apart, and can keep\r\nwithin call all the time.\"\r\n\r\nAdmonished by the lateness of the hour, Howard almost ran. He grew\r\nsomewhat impatient at the unexpected extent of the hill; but finally he\r\npassed beyond the southern point, and as he stood and listened, he heard\r\nthe murmur of the river--proof that it was close at hand.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" thought he, \"if Elwood will only hurry, we have a good chance of\r\nfinding Tim before he gives us up for lost.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy could not see that anything at all was gained by their course in\r\npassing around the ridge. Neither of them, were in sight of the river,\r\nand would have to advance still further before they could form any idea\r\nof their whereabouts. He was resolved to do this in company with his\r\ncousin, so that precisely the same thing would have been accomplished\r\nhad they remained together.\r\n\r\nHoward having hurried a great deal, thought it likely that he was some\r\ndistance in advance of his cousin. He stood some minutes listening for\r\nhis signals, and then began walking toward the northern end of the hill\r\nthat he might meet him as he came around. He observed as he advanced\r\nthat they increased in rocky ruggedness, and could see that it was quite\r\na feat to pass through them.\r\n\r\nGoing some distance he paused again, and listened intently, but nothing\r\nbeside the deep murmur of the woods reached his ear.\r\n\r\n\"What can it mean?\" he finally asked himself, as a vague alarm crept\r\nover him. \"We must be much closer together than we were before, and I\r\nhaven't heard him whistle for the last half-hour.\"\r\n\r\nHe began to doubt whether it was best to proceed further or not. It\r\nmight serve only to mislead in case Elwood was searching for him. Still\r\nhearing nothing to indicate the location of his friend, he made the\r\nsignal himself--a long, screeching whistle, that rang out in the solemn\r\nstillness with a penetrating clearness that sent the chills over him\r\nfrom head to foot.\r\n\r\n\"He must hear that if he is within a mile,\" was his reflection, as he\r\nleaned his head forward and listened for the first approach of the\r\nanswering sound.\r\n\r\nTen, fifteen, twenty minutes passed away, but nothing was heard, and the\r\npoor boy looked around in sore alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Can it be that Elwood is jesting?\" he asked himself. \"He would not do\r\nso if he knew what I am suffering.\"\r\n\r\nHoward was now in great distress. He could not decide what to do. If he\r\nadvanced he could feel no assurance of meeting his friend, while a\r\nretreat was equally hopeless.\r\n\r\nWhere was Elwood? Had he wandered off among the hills, tempted by the\r\nwild scenery, and had he lost his way? Was he searching for his cousin?\r\nOr had he been found by Indians?\r\n\r\nThe last inquiry had been rising in Howard's mind for a half-hour, but\r\nhe had resolutely forced it down again, until he could keep it away no\r\nlonger. He could find no other reason to account for the silence, and\r\nfailure to answer his call. The whistle which he had given must have\r\nspread miles in every direction--so far that Elwood could not have got\r\nbeyond its range had the course of both been precisely opposite. No; it\r\nmust----\r\n\r\nBut, hark! A faint, tremulous whistle comes to his ear. It is far away\r\nand sounds among the hills behind, as though it had labored up from some\r\ncave or chasm miles distant. Howard held his breath, and as he\r\nanticipated, it came again so faintly and distantly that had he been\r\nwalking he could not have heard it.\r\n\r\nOn both occasions it sounded behind him among the hills, though its\r\ntremulous faintness made it appear as though it came from far up in the\r\nair, or down deep in some of the gorges of the hills--so uncertain was\r\nthe exact point of its starting.\r\n\r\nPoor Howard was now in a dilemma. Whether to attempt to follow up the\r\nsignal or to go on to the river and search out Tim O'Rooney and the\r\nNewfoundland was a question which was difficult to decide. But his\r\neagerness to find his cousin led him on into the hills, until he had\r\npenetrated quite a distance. He then paused and listened for the signal,\r\nbut none was ever to come to his ears again.\r\n\r\nHoward repeated the whistle over and over, and finally fired his gun;\r\nbut both were equally fruitless. He waited where he was until dark, when\r\nwith a sad heart he withdrew and resumed his tramp toward the river.\r\nGloomy indeed were his meditations, as he reflected on the occurrences\r\nof the day, and there was scarcely anything he would not do, if by any\r\nmeans he could recall _his_ part since he landed upon the main shore.\r\n\r\nIn the course of half an hour he reached the river, and looked intently\r\nout into the semi-darkness to see whether he could recognize anything\r\nfamiliar; but so far as he was able to see, all was strange, from which\r\nhe concluded that he had struck at a point lower down than where Tim had\r\nbeen left.\r\n\r\nHe therefore began making his way south, that is, toward the source of\r\nthe river, after halting and listening for some sound that might tell\r\nsomething either of Tim or Elwood. Suddenly a threatening growl startled\r\nhim, and then came the welcome bark of Terror, and the next moment the\r\ndog was frolicking around him and showing his delight in the most\r\nextravagant manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nWAITING AND WATCHING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Worrah! worrah! but this is a fine scare you've been givin' Tim\r\nO'Rooney, so me uncle said whin they towld him his wife was coming over\r\nto Ameriky to see him. Here I've been awake fur the last two hours,\r\njist, looking and expacting you to come back, and thinking the red\r\ncolored gintleman had carried you away entirely----\"\r\n\r\nHoward impatiently interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen or heard anything of Elwood?\"\r\n\r\n\"No-o-o!\" replied Tim, his answer rising and falling in a circumflex\r\nthrough a half-dozen notes of the scale.\r\n\r\n_\"Then he is lost!\"_\r\n\r\n\"What?\" fairly shrieked the Irishman.\r\n\r\n\"He is lost in the woods.\"\r\n\r\nHoward had little heart to go over the experiences of the afternoon. He\r\nsimply told his friend that he and Elwood had separated on their return,\r\nand he had been unable to find him again.\r\n\r\n\"What did you separate for?\" asked the listener.\r\n\r\n\"Because I was a fool; but O, Tim, there is no use of regretting what\r\nhas been done. If Elwood is lost, I shall never leave this place.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a while Howard became more composed, and they conversed rationally\r\nupon the best plan for them to follow. Tim O'Rooney was strenuous in his\r\nbelief that Elwood had wandered off among the hills, and finding it\r\ngrowing dark, had sought some secure shelter for the night. He was sure\r\nthat he would give vigorous signs of his whereabouts as soon as day\r\ndawned.\r\n\r\nThere was something in the daring nature of the boy that made it\r\nprobable that Tim was right. Tempted out of his path by some singular or\r\nunexpected sight, he had wandered away until he found it too dark to\r\nreturn, and so had made the best of the matter and camped in some tree,\r\nor beneath the ledge of some projecting rock.\r\n\r\nSuch was the theory of Tim O'Rooney, and so ingeniously did he enforce\r\nit that Howard could not avoid its plausibility. None knew better than\r\nhe the impulsive nature of the boy, and such an act upon his part would\r\nbe in perfect keeping with similar exploits.\r\n\r\nThere was but one thing that raised a doubt in the mind of Howard--and\r\nslight as was this, it was enough to give him sore uneasiness, and at\r\ntimes almost to destroy hope. At the time the boys separated, Elwood had\r\nshown a great anxiety to reach Tim, and proposed his plan in the belief\r\nthat it would bring them together the more quickly.\r\n\r\nThis made it seem improbable to Howard that he would have allowed\r\nanything to divert him from his course unless his personal safety caused\r\nhim to do so; but Tim said that if such were the case they would have\r\nheard his gun.\r\n\r\n\"Do you s'pose he's the boy to lit a wild animal or any of them red\r\ngintlemen step up to him without his tachin' thim manners? But he's the\r\nyoungster that wouldn't do the same. You'd hear that gun of his cracking\r\naway as long as there was any lift for him to crack.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be as you think, Tim, but I believe it is worse. Suppose he is\r\nin the hands of some of these wandering bands of Indians.\"\r\n\r\n\"S'pose he isn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have done that; but let us face the worst. If he has been taken away\r\nby them, what shall we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hunt him up.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true, but how that is to be done is the difficulty. If we only\r\nhad Shasta with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrah, now, if ye'd had him ye'd've niver gone thramping off in the\r\nwoods and having me alone here with the dog. The red gintleman knowed\r\nwhat was best for us, and do ye mind, he kept his eye upon yez all the\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nHoward had thought the same thing a score of times since noon, and there\r\nwas no need of his being told how the Pah Utah would have acted had he\r\nremained with them.\r\n\r\n\"I thinks Mr. Shasta isn't a great many miles off. P'rhaps,\" added Tim,\r\nsignificantly, \"he's kapin' watch upon us and will come to our help in\r\nour throuble.\"\r\n\r\nBut the contingency, to Howard at least, was too remote for him to build\r\nany hopes upon it. It seemed more probable that the Indian's friendship\r\nhad led him much further out of the way than they had suspected, and\r\nthat he was now many a long mile off, speeding toward home.\r\n\r\n\"He may find out that the youngster is wid 'em,\" added Tim, \"whin he\r\nwill hasten to his relaaf.\"\r\n\r\n\"That seems the most likely.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's but one thing agin it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is that?\"\r\n\r\nBut the Irishman was silent. The boy repeated his question.\r\n\r\n\"It's bad--let it be.\"\r\n\r\nBut Howard insisted.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, you know, they may--wal--_put him out the way_.\"\r\n\r\n\"O Tim!\" groaned Howard, \"that cannot be, that cannot be!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hopes not, but there's no telling what these sarpints may take into\r\ntheir heads to do. They're a bad set of craytures, always barring Mr.\r\nShasta, and I'd've thought a good daal more of the same if he'd only\r\nstaid a few days longer wid us.\"\r\n\r\n\"He thought we had enough sense to take care of ourselves, after he had\r\nseen us through the most dangerous part of our journey, otherwise he\r\nwould have remained with us to the end. But, as I said a minute ago, it\r\ndoes no good for us to lament what cannot be helped. As soon as it is\r\nlight we must go up among the hills with Terror and make a hunt for\r\nElwood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yees spake the truth. The dog may be smarter than we is, and I'm\r\nthinkin' it wouldn't have to be very smart to be in that same fix, and\r\nwe'll sarch till we finds out something about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is fortunate for poor Elwood that the night is so mild and\r\npleasant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fort'nit for ourselves, be the same towken; for without our fire we'd\r\nbe rather cool when we slept, and the cold would keep us awake all\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we have the blanket with us, and that would protect us at any time,\r\nno matter how cold it might be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis,\" assented Tim, with a great sigh. \"If I only had me pipe under way\r\nI'd faal somewhat more comfortable, barring the worriment I faals at the\r\nabsence of the youngster. May God watch over him through the darkniss!\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen!\" was this reverent response of Howard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE SEARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll through the night Tim O'Rooney and Howard Lawrence sat in close\r\nconsultation. Hunger and sleep were alike unthought of. Elwood Brandon\r\nwas lost, and that was all of which they could think or speak. How they\r\nlonged for the morning, and how impatient they were to be on the hunt!\r\nIt seemed to Howard as if he could go leaping and flying down the chasms\r\nand gorges among the hills, and never tire until he had hunted out and\r\nbrought back his cousin. Where could he be? If nestling in the branches\r\nof a tree, or hid away among the rocks, was he asleep? Or if awake, of\r\nwhat was he thinking? Did he believe that Howard was searching for him?\r\nOr did he imagine him also lost? It would not be reasonable to suppose\r\nthat he had any suspicion of his finding Tim O'Rooney.\r\n\r\nIf in the hands of California Indians----But it would be vain to trace\r\nout all the thoughts and speculations that ran through the head of the\r\nboy. Some of them were of the wildest and most grotesque character, and\r\nwould assume a ludicrous phase to one whose mind was not in such a whirl\r\nof excitement and distress.\r\n\r\nIn the gloom of the wood the darkness was so intense that neither Tim\r\nnor Howard could distinguish each other, though only a few feet apart.\r\nThe Newfoundland lay close to his master, seemingly sound asleep, but\r\nmore heedful than the two of the approach of danger.\r\n\r\nOccasionally through the night the call of some wild animal was\r\nheard--sometimes distant and sometimes so near that they started to\r\ntheir feet and were about to enter their canoe and shove out into the\r\nstream; but when it came no more they were reassured. Then something\r\nlike the report of a gun came faintly up the river to their ears.\r\n\r\nThese sounds only served to render the night more gloomy and lonely, and\r\nto make the daylight the more welcome.\r\n\r\n\"Now let's be off,\" said Howard, as soon as it was light enough to\r\ndistinguish each other's faces.\r\n\r\n\"We must find some means of remembering this place, or we'll never see\r\nthe canoe agin, and will be obliged to sail into San Francisco on fut.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat was drawn entirely out of the water and covered as much as\r\npossible with leaves and undergrowth; for it was a loss that under any\r\ncircumstances they could not sustain. The feat of marking the place so\r\nthat they could readily return to it from any direction was more\r\ndifficult; but Howard finally hit upon quite an ingenious scheme. They\r\nwaited until the sun had approached near enough to the horizon that they\r\ncould tell precisely the point where it would appear, and then turning\r\ntheir backs against it they walked forward until they reached the hills\r\nwhere Elwood had disappeared. Here they noticed the character and\r\nformation of the rocks so particularly that they could recognize them\r\nthe moment they saw them. Thus the hills were such a conspicuous\r\nlandmark as to be seen from a great distance; and, as they did not\r\nintend to go out of their sight, all they had to do was to hunt till\r\nthey found this spot, and then walk due east.\r\n\r\nAll this was agreed upon, and they were among the hills just as the sun\r\nwas coming up the horizon. Here, after whistling and shouting for\r\nsometime without receiving any response, they concluded to search for\r\nthe point where the boys separated. This was quite distant, and over an\r\nhour was required to find the place, and when it was discovered Howard\r\ncould not be positive that he was right.\r\n\r\nBut as time was of the greatest importance, they pressed on, the dog\r\nsnuffing the ground as though he had scented the footprints, but he\r\nfailed to follow them with certainty. Several hundred yards brought them\r\nto an opening in the hills just broad enough to admit the body of a man.\r\nIt was not a tunnel-like opening, but a rent, as if the hills had been\r\npulled a few feet asunder by the power of an earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe two paused in doubt before this.\r\n\r\n\"He went in there,\" said Tim. \"He couldn't help it, no matter how great\r\nhis hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am half disposed to believe you; at any rate let us follow it some\r\nways.\"\r\n\r\nTerror was running over the ground, as though he had made a discovery,\r\nand he finally whisked forward out of sight.\r\n\r\n\"That looks as if he were upon his trail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, or somebody ilse's; maybe some of the rid gintlemen has took his\r\nmarnin' walk in this direction.\"\r\n\r\nThey followed the path with caution, and were surprised the further they\r\nadvanced. It wound around and among the rocks, which came so close\r\ntogether as to forbid the passage of a man, and the sides never\r\nwithdrawing more than a dozen feet.\r\n\r\n\"It looks as though it had been made on purpose,\" said Tim, gazing\r\naround him in admiration.\r\n\r\nFinally, it was broken up among the hills, after winding through every\r\npoint of the compass for fully an eighth of a mile. It gradually rose\r\nfrom its commencement--occasionally interrupted by sharp ascents--until\r\nits termination, when they found they had reached no mean elevation.\r\n\r\nStill the rocks rose on every hand, and shut out their view of the\r\nsurrounding country, but showed them a specimen of the wild scenery\r\nproduced in California. The interior of the hills was cut up by chasms,\r\ngorges and ravines, and they heard, but did not see, the rush of a small\r\nstream of water.\r\n\r\nThey stood in silence a few moments and then Howard said:\r\n\r\n\"If he is lost in here there is no need of us looking for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"We might search till we died of old age, and never find the least trace\r\nof him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And might discover the poor youngster's body the first half-hour we\r\nspint in looking.\"\r\n\r\nThis last remark caused Howard to start off at once, fully resolved not\r\nto pause again in the search until compelled to do so.\r\n\r\nTerror was constantly commanded to hunt for the trail of the boy, and\r\nthe dog appeared to understand what was expected of him, for he was\r\nrunning constantly hither and thither, but never gave sign that he had\r\nfound anything positive.\r\n\r\nThis fact led Howard to doubt whether Elwood had preceded them in this\r\nplace. If he had really been here, he must have passed directly over the\r\nspot upon which they were standing, and it seemed hardly possible that\r\nthe dog could miss the scent. So strong was he impressed with this that\r\nhe proposed to Tim O'Rooney to turn back and resume their search outside\r\nthe hills; but he was so sure that Elwood Brandon could never have\r\npassed unentered such an inviting opening that he would not consent to\r\nwithdraw until they examined further.\r\n\r\nLooking around they saw several paths by which they could enter the\r\nwild, desolate-looking scene before them. Of course, it was all a matter\r\nof chance whether they took the one which had been followed by their\r\nlost friend. Tim affirmed that the one that looked the most dangerous\r\nand uninviting was surely the right one; but Howard was hardly prepared\r\nto admit this. Selecting the most accessible, they carefully followed it\r\nfor over an hour. In and out among the rocks, sometimes over their tops,\r\nthen between or around them, down through ravines, and then along their\r\nedges, up the stony, earthy sides of the gorges, until at length they\r\nhalted as they believed in the very heart of this wild looking place.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are!\" said Howard. \"I don't see how we can advance much further\r\nwithout going out to the other side.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the qua'rest sight I iver looked upon,\" said Tim, turning round\r\nand round, meaning the wild scenery.\r\n\r\n\"But there is nothing learned of Elwood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Niver a sign do I saa of the youngster,\" rejoined Tim. \"I graive to\r\nthink we cannot be near him.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have gone on the wrong track.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a feared so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too bad, too bad,\" wailed Howard, \"what is to come of the poor fellow?\"\r\n\r\n\"But we can't till,\" hastily added Tim, \"do yees put your fingers in\r\nyour mouth and give that jolly little whistle.\"\r\n\r\nHoward Lawrence was in the very act of doing so when his arm was\r\nsuddenly arrested by his companion, who, with an exclamation of surprise\r\npointed to a ledge of rocks above them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE SEARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a hundred and fifty feet above them, almost perpendicularly\r\nupward, stood an antelope, its small neck outstretched, and its dark,\r\nbeautiful eyes fixed upon them with a wondering expression. It was on\r\nthe very edge of a projecting rock where one step more would bring it\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\"It is jist the jintleman we wants,\" whispered Tim, fearful that he\r\nwould alarm the timid animal. \"We've ate but once in twenty-four hours,\r\nand I've jist learned from me stomach that it would have no objection to\r\nbreaking the same fast; so do yez jist kape still till I pops him over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you hit him?\" asked Howard, scarcely less excited than his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"Be aisy now till ye see the scientific manner I takes to doot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, be quick, for he is likely to vanish any moment.\"\r\n\r\nTim O'Rooney carefully sighted his rifle, took a quick, steady aim, and\r\npulled the trigger. Howard, who was keenly watching the antelope, saw it\r\nspring up, and as it came down it missed the cliff and fell almost at\r\ntheir very feet with a violence and crash which must have broken half\r\nthe bones in its body.\r\n\r\n\"Arrah now, an' wasn't that done nicely?\" exclaimed Tim, in great\r\nexultation, as he ran up to the animal with his knife.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to dress it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis; an' do yez gather what sticks an' stuff ye can, an' we'll have him\r\ncooked in a jiffy.\"\r\n\r\nHoward set about it, for he understood the wisdom of providing\r\nthemselves with food in the prosecution of this hunt, which in all\r\nprobability would employ them for some time to come.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I will give the signal,\" said he, when his work was completed. \"If\r\nhe is within hearing he will answer it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis; do your bist, while I pays my respects to this gintleman, an' do\r\nye do the listenin' while ye are about it, for I'm so taken up with this\r\njob that I haven't the time to attend to that aither.\"\r\n\r\nHoward strained his cheeks nearly to bursting, and completely exhausted\r\nhimself in giving forth those ringing screeches which seem to come\r\nnatural to all school-boys, and are made by uniting the ends of two\r\nfingers, inserting them between the lips, and blowing with all the\r\nmight.\r\n\r\nHe listened--listened--listened--and then repeated the signal with a\r\ndesperate fierceness that left him no strength at all; but all in\r\nvain--the echoes died away among the rocks and hills, but no answer came\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use,\" remarked Tim O'Rooney, who despite what he had said was\r\nlistening as earnestly as his young friend.\r\n\r\n\"The youngster don't hear us. We've got to make a hunt through this old\r\nplace, and afore we begins it we'll take something for the stomach's\r\nsake.\"\r\n\r\nThe fire was kindled in the usual manner, and the dinner was not\r\nunskillfully prepared by the Irishman. They ate all they could hold. The\r\ndog did the same. Tim lit his pipe, and then declared that he was ready\r\nfor any duty that might be required of him.\r\n\r\nAs they rose to their feet they were somewhat alarmed at the appearance\r\nof the sky. It was overspread with dark, threatening clouds, from which\r\nissued rumbling peals of thunder and arrowy lines of lightning. They\r\nbecame darker and more tumultuous each moment, until semi-darkness\r\nshrouded them.\r\n\r\n\"We are going to have a storm,\" remarked Howard.\r\n\r\n\"Yis; and a good-sized one, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to find shelter for ourselves. If much rain falls, this\r\ngorge looks to me as if it will be filled with water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Worrah, now, but yez are a smart child!\" exclaimed Tim O'Rooney,\r\nlooking admiringly at the boy. \"Scarcely mesilf would have thought of\r\nthe same, and what a credit, therefore, that it should have come into\r\nyour own.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see nothing so wonderful about that. Almost any one would see the\r\ndanger we are in if we remain here when there is much rain falling. It\r\nis just the place for a stream of water.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is--so it is; and yez can saa that there has wather been running\r\nover the stones upon which we are standing.\"\r\n\r\nThe storm which was so near at hand admonished them to lose no time in\r\nseeking shelter. This was a matter of small difficulty, as in such a\r\nwild, rugged place there were any number of retreats. They clambered up\r\nthe path and over the rocks until they reached a point higher yet than\r\nwhere the antelope had stood when pierced by the bullet that had tumbled\r\nhim over the cliff. They had brought a goodly portion of his meat with\r\nthem, for there was no telling when they would dare fire a gun again.\r\n\r\nA gaping, overhanging ledge, which fortunately was turned from the\r\ndirection of the storm, was selected as their house, and here they and\r\nthe dog nestled and waited for the storm to burst. A few large drops\r\nthat cracked smartly upon the rocks and stones, was the herald of the\r\ncoming deluge; and then, at the same moment, with a terrific flash and\r\nreport, came the rain in torrents.\r\n\r\nThey stood and watched the storm as it raged, and when there was a\r\nmomentary cessation Howard threw his blanket over his head and said:\r\n\r\n\"I will run out to the edge of that rock and see whether there is any\r\nwater in the place where we took our dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be careful yez don't tumble over,\" admonished Tim, feeling it his duty\r\nto say something.\r\n\r\n\"Never fear.\"\r\n\r\nHoward stepped hastily to the spot and looked carefully over. A tiny\r\nstream was just beginning to run through the path they had occupied,\r\nwhich was increasing each moment, and would speedily reach the\r\nproportions of a torrent. But, although he saw this, there was something\r\nwhich interested him still more, and that was a party of five Indians\r\nattentively examining the remains of the antelope, and the signs around\r\nit, as if they were seeking their explanation. They looked down to the\r\nground, and two of them pointed precisely in the direction which Tim and\r\nHoward had taken in leaving the place.\r\n\r\nThe rain began falling again more copiously than ever, but Howard would\r\nnot have heeded it had he not been shrouded in the water-proof blanket.\r\nThose Indians had found their camp-fire and were at that moment\r\ndiscussing the best method of capturing him and Tim; but the rain came\r\ndown so furiously that they finally darted away to seek shelter, and\r\nHoward thereupon hurried back to his friend and told him all that he had\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n\"That settles the matter,\" he added. \"Elwood is in their hands, and if\r\nwe aint careful we shall be with him, for they are searching for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they can't find us--that they can't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"This rain will wipe out our tracks as aisy as if yees had taken a cloth\r\nand done it yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true.\"\r\n\r\nHoward was greatly relieved when he reflected that this was true, and\r\nthat he and Tim were in no danger of capture from being pursued.\r\n\r\nThe storm lasted several hours, and when it was finished they came\r\ncautiously forth and made their way stealthily back to where they had\r\nleft the canoe. They had deliberated long and earnestly regarding Elwood\r\nBrandon, and neither of them had any doubt but what he was in the hands\r\nof Indians. They had little fear of his being put to death, but believed\r\nhe would be held a prisoner until either rescued by Shasta, or a party\r\ncould be sent from the nearest post to ransom him. They had concluded to\r\nmake all haste homeward and adopt this method of rescue.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as they had given him up for a while, it is high time we took\r\nhim in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nA BOY LOST.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Elwood Brandon separated from Howard Lawrence on the afternoon of\r\ntheir ramble in the woods, it was with the firm intention of making all\r\nhaste around the range of hills, and there to unite with him in their\r\nhunt for Tim.\r\n\r\nBut, like too many boys, he suffered himself to be led from the sure\r\npath by the allurements of the false one. His example furnished a\r\nstriking moral lesson, which he will doubtless remember to the day of\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\nWhen we are following the course which conscience tells us is the true\r\none, although it may be rough and stony, and at times most difficult to\r\nkeep, yet the knowledge of what awaits us at the end should be proof\r\nagainst temptations to turn aside. Woe to him who chides the voice of\r\nconscience and listens to that of the charmer!\r\n\r\nElwood had gone some distance, and was walking very rapidly, when he\r\ncame abruptly upon the opening in the rocks which has been mentioned in\r\nanother place.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! here is a shorter cut across,\" was his reflection as he saw it, and\r\nnot stopping to think further, he turned and walked rapidly through it.\r\n\"I will beat Howard,\" and he smiled at the thought. \"What will he think\r\nwhen he gets around to see me waiting for him? I know he will run so as\r\nto be there first.\"\r\n\r\nThus hopeful, Elwood hurried forward, thinking only of the surprise he\r\nwould give his cousin when they met again. As he found the path taking a\r\nmost sinuous course, a dim idea came through his head that perhaps after\r\nall he had not gained so much by \"cutting across.\" He would have turned\r\nback as it was but for the rapidly increasing darkness and the belief\r\nthat he must speedily emerge from the eastern side of the hills.\r\n\r\nWhile walking through a narrow part of the path, he was alarmed by the\r\nrattling of some dirt, stones and debris over his head, and before he\r\ncould retreat or advance he was stricken on the head by several pieces\r\nwith such violence that he staggered and fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nHe was not senseless, but somewhat stunned, and placed his hand on his\r\nhead to see whether it was cut. Finding no blood, he arose to his feet\r\nand replied to the whistle of Howard, which had been ringing in his ears\r\nfor the last ten minutes.\r\n\r\nImmediately after, he was taken with a sickness at the stomach, the\r\nresult, doubtless, of the mental shock received. Such was his faintness\r\nand nausea that he lay down upon the ground for relief. When a boy feels\r\nso sick--as shown also by older persons in seasickness--he generally\r\nbecomes perfectly indifferent to everything else in the world. Elwood\r\nconcluded that Howard might whistle as long as he chose, and he would\r\nreply when he felt able. As for the gathering darkness, wild animals and\r\nsavages, what did he care for them? They could exist and get along\r\nwithout his taking any trouble to think about them.\r\n\r\nAnd so he lay still until his sickness diminished and was gradually\r\nsucceeded by drowsiness, which was not long in merging into slumber.\r\n\r\nWhoever yet remembered the moment he went to sleep? Whoever lay still to\r\ngain a few moments of slumber without obtaining far more than he\r\nexpected, and regretting it when his intellect became sharp and clear?\r\n\r\nIt was near midnight when Elwood awoke, and all was blank darkness. He\r\ncalled to Howard and Tim, and not until he had felt around with his\r\nhands, did he remember his situation. Then it all came to him.\r\n\r\n\"This is a pretty piece of business,\" he thought, as he arose to his\r\nfeet. \"Poor Howard is half-frightened to death, and I suppose is still\r\nhunting for me. But I don't hear him.\"\r\n\r\nHe listened, but all was still.\r\n\r\n\"It may be that he has grown tired, but will hear me if I call to him.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon he whistled again and again, and shouted and listened and then\r\nrepeated his signals, but there was no response. But for the intervening\r\nhills his cry would have reached the two watchers by the river shore,\r\nbut with twice the penetrating power he still would have failed to reach\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the best thing I can do is to wait here until morning, and then I\r\ncan make my way back again.\"\r\n\r\nHis sickness was gone, but he felt somewhat chilled from lying upon the\r\nground with no extra covering, although the night was quite moderate, if\r\nnot really warm. The contact with the ground had made a portion of his\r\nbody cold, and the sluggish circulation prompted him to exercise.\r\n\r\n\"I hardly know whether to stay here or to go back to the woods and take\r\nrefuge in a tree. Some animals may find me here, while I shall be safe\r\nif I am only twenty feet above ground.\"\r\n\r\nThe vivid recollection of the wolverines gave him this fear and finally\r\ninduced him to leave the place and seek shelter.\r\n\r\nBut at the moment of starting he was confronted by an alarming\r\ndifficulty. He found it impossible to decide upon the proper course to\r\nfollow, and could not tell with certainty which way led in or out. This\r\nresulted from his having turned around several times in his effort to\r\nrestore warmth and circulation on awaking from his sleep. Had he not\r\ndone this the position in which he lay during slumber would have told\r\nhim the truth.\r\n\r\n\"How strange!\" he reflected, vainly seeking to recover from his\r\nbewilderment. \"If I only had a little light I think I could tell, but\r\nthis is rather delicate business when I don't know whether I may go over\r\nthe rocks or not.\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned against the wall of the path and thought. At last he believed\r\nhe knew which way to turn, and facing backward he began to pick his way\r\nout. This, we may say, was the right course, and had he only persevered\r\nin it would have brought him out of the hills into the woods, restored\r\nhim to Tim and Howard a few hours later and saved him one of the most\r\nmomentous experiences of his life.\r\n\r\nHe had retreated but a few rods when he became sure he had made a\r\nmistake and was going wrong. It seemed from his contact with the rocks\r\nand the curious windings it made, that he had never passed over the\r\nground, but was advancing further into the hills.\r\n\r\n\"This will not do,\" he said aloud, as he paused. \"I am astray and must\r\nchange about.\"\r\n\r\nHe did so at once, and believing, of a surety, that he was now upon the\r\nright path he walked much faster than was prudent. The truth was, the\r\nassociations of the plate were such as to make him in a hurry to get\r\naway from it. He knew he would feel relieved when he could get once more\r\ninto the open air of the woods. A strange fear that the overhanging rock\r\nwould fall or imprison him caused him to hasten still more. After\r\nwalking some time further he slackened his steps.\r\n\r\n\"I must be pretty near the opening, judging by the distance I have come;\r\nand if such be the case--\"\r\n\r\nFurther words were checked, for at that instant Elwood stepped off the\r\npath and went down--down!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nA DREARY NIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nElwood fell about twenty feet, striking the solid earth, without losing\r\nhis own perpendicular position. He was considerably pained, but not\r\nseriously hurt. His rifle had fallen from his hand, and was not found\r\nagain until daybreak, as not knowing where he stood, whether upon the\r\nedge of some precipice or ravine, he scarcely dared move a limb.\r\n\r\nAh! if the night was so weary to the watchers by the river shore, it was\r\nmuch more so to him for whom they thus lay awake. Utter midnight\r\nblackness all around, the profound and impressive stillness made more\r\nprofound and impressive by the trickling of some current near, the\r\noccasional glimpse of some tiny star twinkling among the dark,\r\nstraggling clouds overhead; such was Elwood Brandon's situation and\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nHis only resource was thought, and the direction which this took for a\r\ntime was anything but a relief. He saw that he himself was to blame for\r\nthe disaster of the day. It was he who proposed this ramble, and he who\r\ninsisted so strenuously upon separating from Howard in the journey\r\naround the hills. And then his present situation resulted wholly from\r\nhis own foolishness--to call it no milder term--in entering an unknown\r\npath with the simple hope of reaching a designated point a few minutes\r\nin advance of his friend, whom he knew well enough had carried out to\r\nthe letter their agreement, and was waiting his coming.\r\n\r\nHad Howard found Tim O'Rooney? That was the next question. Or was he\r\nstill lingering on the other side of the hills, waiting for the morning\r\nto renew his hunt for himself before he sought out his companion? The\r\nlatter seemed the most probable supposition to Elwood, and the odd whim\r\ntook him that his cousin was close at hand and listening for the\r\nfamiliar signal. So he placed his fingers to his mouth and repeated the\r\nwhistle which they had used so many times between them.\r\n\r\nHe did this again and again, but there was no response, and he finally\r\nconcluded that it was rather a monotonous manner of passing the time and\r\nceased, and again gave himself up to thought.\r\n\r\nIf he ever lived to see his friends at home what an experience would be\r\nhis to tell! The burning steamer, the hours spent in drifting ashore,\r\nthe wanderings through the wilds of California, this adventure among the\r\nhills--surely they were enough to last a life-time.\r\n\r\nNow and then a cold draft of wind swept by him, as though the\r\ntemperature of the air was changing. It was in fact the premonition of\r\nthe gathering storm to which we have referred in another place.\r\n\r\nElwood had been in his constrained position a couple of hours when he\r\nwas subjected to a terrible fright. Suddenly some dirt and stones\r\ncommenced moving near him and he felt it strike his feet. He was fearful\r\nthat a landslide was about to take place, but did not dare attempt to\r\nget out of the way. He could only shrink closer against the rocks, pray\r\nto Heaven for protection, and await the issue.\r\n\r\nThe pebbles rattled around him for a long time, and when they had nearly\r\nceased he learned that the whole tumult was caused by some wild animal.\r\nThis dissipated all fear of being engulfed by a landslide, but scarcely\r\nrelieved him. It was simply a change of species in the danger.\r\n\r\nHe could hear the footsteps of the animal as it walked back and forth.\r\nThey sounded above his head, but he could not judge with certainty.\r\nSeveral times it gave a low growl, from which he was sure that it was\r\ndangerous, and if it knew of his presence and could reach him would\r\nspeedily end his reckless conduct forever.\r\n\r\nThe animal was still for a while and the boy was indulging in the belief\r\nthat it had gone, when he heard its footsteps so near that his hair\r\nfairly rose with terror. He stooped down and felt around in the darkness\r\nfor his gun, but it was not within reach. He caught a huge stone and\r\nheld it in reserve for defense.\r\n\r\nStraining his eyes through the darkness, he fancied he could see a dark\r\nobject above him; but it was only fancy, for to his excited imagination\r\nthe most extraordinary phantoms were flitting before him--floating in\r\nthe air, around and above him, like the wonderful visions that visit us\r\nin delirium--until he closed his eyes to shut out the tormenting\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, after all, the presence of the wild animal was the means of\r\nsaving him, for it kept his mind down to the hard, practical fact that\r\nimminent danger was close at hand, and all his thoughts were needed to\r\nmeet it. He stood a long time grasping the stone and expecting the\r\nassault; but the tumult finally ceased and all became still.\r\n\r\nWhen Elwood looked up again he saw that it was growing light, and day\r\nwas indeed breaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nWANDERINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe light increased each moment, and Elwood Brandon soon saw the\r\nposition in which he was placed. He had walked along the path and fallen\r\nabruptly off, alighting on a projection that ran along the edge of the\r\nravine, and was of sufficient width to only comfortably hold him. Had he\r\ngone a yard forward he would have fallen over to another ledge, although\r\nthis was not more than a dozen feet below. Indeed, his rifle had done\r\nthis, and now lay on this broad band of earth and gravel, which here\r\nsloped so gradually down to the bottom of the ravine that it could be\r\ndescended without difficulty.\r\n\r\nHis first proceeding, after thanking Heaven for the protection of the\r\nnight, was to let himself down to where his rifle lay. An examination\r\nproved it uninjured, and with its possession came a feeling of\r\nconfidence and safety such as he had not felt for a moment during the\r\nhours of darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if that wild creature, whatever it was, would like to introduce\r\nitself, I am prepared.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he looked around as if he expected its appearance; but it had left\r\nsome time before. At first he was at a loss to understand what it had\r\nchosen as its parade ground, but, concluded it must have been the very\r\npath from which he had fallen, and where, had he remained, he could not\r\nhave avoided falling into its power.\r\n\r\nElwood could not see the possibility of extricating himself by the same\r\nway in which he had entered. In some places it was necessary to climb a\r\nscore or two feet up the perpendicular side of the ravine; and as there\r\nwas no means at hand for doing this, he thought it best to press on down\r\namong the hills in the hope of discovering a new way of egress, or an\r\neasier access to the paths behind him.\r\n\r\nHe wandered rather aimlessly forward, his path being over loose,\r\nrattling stones, constantly descending, until he reached the hard-packed\r\nearth, and judged himself to be in about the lowermost part of the\r\nvalley. On every hand rose the ridges, rocks and peaks of the hills,\r\nuntil, as he looked up at the cloudy sky so far above him, he seemed but\r\nthe merest pigmy.\r\n\r\nAs he turned his head he caught sight of something a few rods ahead that\r\npuzzled him. For some time he could not make out its meaning, but\r\nfinally he saw that it was a smouldering camp-fire, while around it were\r\nstretched five Indians--although at the moment he could not be positive\r\nas to their number--their blankets over them and they seemingly sound\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nHe concluded that the best thing he could do was to leave that immediate\r\nneighborhood as speedily as possible. He looked hurriedly around for the\r\nbest line of retreat. It was difficult to decide, and he was still\r\ndebating with himself when, as he glanced at the terrifying forms, he\r\nfancied, or really saw, one of them move. Without further reflection he\r\ndarted a rod or two backward and shrunk in behind a breach in the rocks.\r\n\r\nThis was no hiding-place in case the Indians came along this path. He\r\ncould not conceal his body, as it was merely a niche such as would have\r\nbeen made had this portion of the rocky wall been set back about a foot\r\nfrom the rest. If the savages left the ravine by another direction there\r\nwas no cause for fear, but if they came this way he had good reason to\r\ntremble.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely ensconced himself in this place of refuge when from the\r\nwoods and rocks above him came the clear, echoing whistle of Howard\r\nLawrence. It startled him as if it were the whoop of this Indians so\r\nclose at hand. Of course he dare not reply to it, for it could only\r\nprecipitate his capture.\r\n\r\nBut he trembled more for the safety of his friends than himself. They\r\nwere advancing hurriedly in their search, without one suspicion of the\r\nenemies so near them. Had he dared, to make a noise it would have have\r\nbeen one of warning for Tim and Howard to hasten away ere it was too\r\nlate; but even that small comfort was denied him.\r\n\r\nHe peered cautiously out and saw that the Indians were awake, but\r\ncuriously enough appeared to pay no heed to the whistling, which to the\r\nboy were uttered twenty times as often and as loud as there was any\r\nneed. One of the savages was stirring the fire with a stick, while the\r\nothers were looking stupidly on.\r\n\r\nDrawing back his head, Elwood looked up among the rocks in the direction\r\nof the signals for some sign of his friends. He was startled into a\r\nsuppressed exclamation by the sight of Tim O'Rooney's hat and face\r\npassing along the path above him; but before he could catch his eye it\r\nwas gone and he saw it no more.\r\n\r\nThe whistling sound now gradually retreated until it sounded quite far\r\naway, and Elwood began to feel more at ease, although not entirely so.\r\nHe wondered greatly that the suspicions of the Indians were not excited,\r\nand that they did not hasten away at once to destroy his friends.\r\n\r\nThe report of Tim O'Rooney's gun that slew the antelope sounded\r\nfearfully near, and sent a shiver of terror through the youngster\r\ncrouching in his hiding-place. At the same time, as he looked stealthily\r\nout, he saw that it had attracted the attention of the Indians. All five\r\nwere standing on their feet, with their loose blankets hung over their\r\nshoulders, and gesticulating with their arms. The sound of their voices\r\nwas plainly heard where he stood, and a thrill of hope ran through him\r\nas he imagined that he recognised in one of them a resemblance to that\r\nof Shasta, the Pah Utah.\r\n\r\nAt this point the boy observed the storm gathering overhead--the sullen\r\nbooming of thunder, the black clouds sweeping tumultuously across the\r\nsky, the vivid spears of lightning darting in and out among them. A cool\r\nwind whistled through the gorge overhead, and dust and leaves came\r\nwhirling in the air and settled all around him.\r\n\r\nThe boy looked above, and saw that when the storm did burst it was sure\r\nto spend its full fury upon his head. Not the least particle of shelter\r\ncovered him, and he had to expect a full drenching; but this he was\r\nwilling to bear, if it would only tend to keep the attention of the\r\nIndians diverted. It seemed to him very probable, as he stood between\r\nthem and his own friends, that in following up the suspicious report of\r\nthe rifle they would pass directly by him, in which case he had about\r\none chance out of a thousand of remaining unseen by them.\r\n\r\nElwood did not dare to look out, so fearful was he of being seen. He\r\nbelieved that the heads of the savages were turned toward him, in which\r\ncase the risk was too great. He therefore, unheedful of the large drops\r\nthat were beginning to patter around him, stood and listened.\r\n\r\nHark! He hears their tread! His heart throbs faster than ever, as he\r\nknows they are coming toward him! Closer and closer he shrinks to the\r\nrock, as if to bury himself in its flinty surface.\r\n\r\nAll at once, an Indian, too tall and muscular to be Shasta, steps to\r\nview and passes beyond him without turning his head; the second is about\r\nthe right height, but the one furtive glance stole at him shows that he\r\nis a stranger; so as regards the third; the fourth is too short, he\r\npasses on in the procession. The fifth and last Elwood at first believed\r\nto be Shasta, but a second look showed him his mistake. Had he held any\r\ndoubts they were removed by the Indian abruptly pausing, turning his\r\nface full toward him, and uttering the _\"hoogh!\"_ of surprise, as he saw\r\nthe boy cowering against the rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nA OLD ACQUAINTANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instant the hindmost Indian uttered his exclamation of surprise, the\r\nothers paused, and thus, before Elwood Brandon fully realized his\r\ndanger, he found himself confronted by the whole force. Resistance or\r\nflight was not to be thought of, so he merely stood still and\r\ntremblingly awaited their will regarding him.\r\n\r\nThey were plainly surprised at finding a boy pressing against the rooks\r\nwith an appearance of the greatest terror, and they gazed at him a\r\nmoment as if uncertain what to do about it. However, they didn't seem to\r\nbe particularly savage or blood-thirsty, nor frightened, as they kept\r\ntheir guns in their hands and their knives in their belts.\r\n\r\nHe who stood nearest to Elwood reached out his brawny arm, grasped him\r\nfirmly and drew him out from his hiding-place. All then scrutinized him\r\nas if to make sure whether he was some wild animal or human being.\r\nSatisfied on this point, the boy was then shoved forward so as to be\r\nbetween the savages, and as they stepped off he was motioned to do the\r\nsame. Elwood understood that he was a prisoner, and he philosophically\r\nsubmitted to his fate.\r\n\r\nAs yet they had not disturbed his weapons; but he had gone a short\r\ndistance only when the Indian directly behind him placed his hand upon\r\nthe muzzle of the gun which was protruding over the youngster's shoulder\r\nand began drawing it. The latter disliked very much to part with the\r\nrifle, and held it as tightly as possible; but as the savage only drew\r\nit the more powerfully, he finally let go and it instantly went from his\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nElwood could not forbear looking around at the one who had thus deprived\r\nhim of his property. As he gazed into his face he was at a loss to\r\nunderstand the expression. The Indian fixed his black eyes upon him, but\r\nhis lips were closed and not a feature moved or twitched. The boy could\r\nnot withstand the fierceness of those orbs and was glad to turn his head\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThey walked quite rapidly up the path, making a turn that gave them a\r\nvery steep ascent. The thunder was booming louder than ever, and the\r\nrain by this time was falling furiously. The party hurried forward until\r\nthey reached the camp which Tim O'Rooney and Howard had so recently\r\ndeserted. Here Elwood took the liberty of protecting himself by backing\r\nagainst the overhanging rock. This was precisely the position which he\r\noccupied when Howard Lawrence gazed over and missed seeing him by such a\r\nnarrow chance.\r\n\r\nWhen the descent of the rain became so copious as to scatter the\r\nsavages, two of them ran up beside Elwood and imitated his action in\r\nprotecting himself from the descending deluge. This was only a partial\r\nsuccess, yet much preferable to standing in the open air and receiving\r\nthe full pelting of the storm.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Howard Lawrence waited until he saw the\r\nIndians hurry away for shelter, when he returned to Tim O'Rooney and the\r\ntwo effected a safe retreat from the dangerous locality. They saw\r\nnothing more of the savages, and their conjecture that Elwood was a\r\nprisoner among them was merely a conjecture, although absolutely\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nThe tiny stream running so quietly at the feet of the two aboriginal\r\nAmericans and Elwood Brandon increased so rapidly that it was evident it\r\nwould speedily become a torrent that would sweep them off their feet,\r\nand that the only safety was to effect as speedy an escape as possible.\r\nTaking him between them, they started directly up the path in the\r\ndirection of their companions. The falling rain and splashing water\r\nalmost blinded Elwood, but he pressed bravely forward until conscious\r\nthat they were beneath some kind of covering, and looking around, saw\r\nthat they stood in a sort of cave, and where they had rejoined the three\r\nIndians who had fled some time before.\r\n\r\nThe shelter proved a secure one, although it was reached rather late to\r\nbe of much benefit to Elwood, who was thoroughly wetted to the skin. He\r\nwas, however, rather pleased at the lenient disposition shown by his\r\ncaptors. They had not offered him the least violence, rudeness or\r\ninsult, and appeared to maintain a very indifferent watch over him. He\r\ndid not believe they intended him any bodily harm, although he trembled\r\nat the consequences when they joined another party or should reach their\r\nown homes. They probably intended to hold him a prisoner so long as he\r\nwas no particular trouble to them; but their leniency was more the\r\nresult of indifference than of genuine kindness--and indifference that\r\nwould as soon witness death as life, and that would not stretch out the\r\nhand to avert the impending doom.\r\n\r\nThe storm raged with unabated fury for several hours, and the tiny\r\nstream, whose murmur could scarcely be heard as it coursed its way\r\nthrough the hills, was now swelled to the dimensions of a torrent, and\r\nroared through its course with a clamor almost deafening. A vast amount\r\nof water had fallen within the few hours, and it would have been very\r\nperilous had any of the party remained where the fire that cooked the\r\nantelope was kindled. A yellow stream some six feet in depth rushed\r\nfuriously through the narrow passage, like some river when compressed\r\ninto its narrow canyon.\r\n\r\nThe Indians stood as motionless as the rocks themselves until the storm\r\nwas over. Each had his blanket slung over his shoulder, extending down\r\nto his knees, and effectually protecting their bodies from the rain\r\nwhich had so thoroughly soaked poor Elwood. None of them sported the\r\ndefiant scalp-locks so common among the more northern Indians; but their\r\nlong, black, stiff hair, resembling precisely that of a horse's mane,\r\ndangled around their shoulders, neck and ears and over their breasts.\r\nMixed in among the hair on the crown were a number of painted feathers,\r\nwhich, having had a touch of rain, drooped down like those of an humbled\r\nchanticleer that has been rescued from the river by some kind hand.\r\nTheir faces being daubed over with green, yellow and red, mixed and\r\nmingled with a sublime disregard of proportion, gave their features a\r\npeculiarly unnatural appearance, such as we see when we survey our\r\nparticular friends through differently and highly colored pieces of\r\nglass. They were fine specimens of the \"noble red man\" that are\r\noccasionally met with now-a-days; but they are of that species of sights\r\nof which it may be said \"distance lends enchantment to the view.\"\r\nHowever, they were happy, for as yet they had not come in contact with\r\ncivilization, and had had no taste for the white man's \"fire-water,\"\r\nthat scourge of the aboriginal race, and which seems destined finally to\r\nsweep them from the continent.\r\n\r\nElwood occupied himself in looking from one of these Indians to the\r\nother, and speculating regarding their thoughts and opinions about\r\nhimself, of whose presence they seemed so unconscious. Indeed, they\r\nscarcely looked at him except when he sneezed, and then their heads shot\r\nround as suddenly as if they were moved by machinery and the spasm had\r\nlet on the steam.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the falling of the rain ceased, two of the Indians went\r\nout to look for the remainder of their prisoner's party, which they\r\nknew, if not already there, had been so recently among the hills. The\r\nvast rush of water, of course, had obliterated all signs where they had\r\nmade any, and they could only hope to find them by discovering the trail\r\nmade since the storm, or by the sight of themselves.\r\n\r\nNot a word did the savages exchange with each other. They appeared to\r\nunderstand what each thought, and what duty was required of them, which\r\nduty for the present resembled that of watching and waiting.\r\n\r\nAs the day wore away the boy began to feel chilly and hungry. His wet\r\nclothes were anything but comfortable, and his hollow stomach was a poor\r\nprotection against the sinking feeling. As his captors showed no\r\ndisposition to leave the place, or even to change their statue-like\r\npositions, he began to grow anxious. He feared an attack of sickness if\r\nhis wants were not supplied; and after debating with himself a few\r\nmoments, he walked up to the tallest Indian and motioned that he needed\r\nsomething to eat.\r\n\r\nThe reply was startling and decisive. The dusky rascal surveyed him\r\nsharply a moment, and then drew his knife and raised it in a menacing\r\nmanner over his head. And thereupon Elwood retreated to his position,\r\nand concluded he wasn't quite as hungry as he first imagined.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to tell what this singular captivity of Elwood Brandon's\r\nwould have eventuated in had not an unexpected diversion occurred in his\r\nfavor. Just as it was getting dark, the two Indiana who had gone out at\r\nthe close of the storm returned. They had a companion with them, and we\r\nleave our readers to imagine what the boy's feelings were when he\r\nrecognized in the third his old friend Shasta, the Pah Utah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nA FRIEND IN NEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Pah Utah entered the cave he did not appear to notice Elwood\r\nBrandon. The latter attributed this to the semi-darkness in which he\r\nstood, and was about to go forward and claim his friendship when\r\nsomething restrained him, and he concluded to wait until the Indian\r\nfirst recognized him.\r\n\r\nShasta exchanged a few words with his friends, and immediately several\r\nof them went out in the darkness. When they returned, which was very\r\nspeedily, they each bore a goodly bundle of sticks and kindlings. In\r\nwhat part of the wide creation they obtained them, directly after such a\r\ndeluge of rain, it is impossible to tell, but American Indians have a\r\npeculiar faculty of doing such odd things.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later a blaze sprung out from the center of the bundle\r\nplaced in the middle of the cave, and when Elwood looked downward toward\r\nit, he saw that Shasta was kneeling before the pile engaged in igniting\r\nit. As the flame flared out and illuminated the cave, the Pah Utah\r\nlooked up and met the eyes of Elwood. For an instant, his black eyes\r\nwere fixed upon him, and then he placed his finger to his lips and\r\nlooked down again. The boy understood it all. _He didn't know anything\r\nof the Pah Utah._\r\n\r\nThe fire burned vigorously and soon diffused a genial warmth throughout\r\nthe cave. It was most grateful indeed to Elwood, who approached and\r\nsubjected himself to a toasting process. The savages offered no\r\nobjection, and he soon managed to secure a pleasant warmth, and\r\npartially to dry his damp clothes.\r\n\r\nHe could not prevent himself from continually glancing at Shasta, but he\r\nnever once caught his eye, and understanding the Indian's wishes, he\r\ncompensated for this impertinence by staring twice as long at the other\r\nhideous visages.\r\n\r\nAfter all the great want of Elwood was food. He had fasted for thirty\r\nhours, and was faint and feeble. A month before such severe abstinence\r\nwould have left him unable to stand; but the severe deprivation and\r\nhardship of the last week, united with its firm, buoyant constitution,\r\nand his freedom from the degrading use of tobacco, had developed a\r\nstrength and endurance remarkable in one so young. He felt that he could\r\nwait until the next day without a mouthful, and still be able to travel;\r\nbut the fainting, craving, hollow feeling rendered him uncomfortable and\r\ncaused more than one longing look around the cavern and in the faces of\r\nhis dusky-hued friends; but if the Indians understood his suffering they\r\ncertainly did not care enough about them to give them heed.\r\n\r\nHis hope was in the Pah Utah, but his situation was such as to deprive\r\nhim of the expression of this hope. Shasta had given him to understand\r\nin an unmistakable manner that for the present they were to remain\r\nstrangers; and no matter what his distress might be, he dare not\r\ndisregard this command.\r\n\r\nYet Elwood Brandon believed, if the Indian understood his case, he would\r\nfind some means to relieve him, slight though it was. Finally he decided\r\nupon his course of action.\r\n\r\nWalking up to the tall Indian, who had received his previous request in\r\nsuch a threatening manner, and halting when at a safe distance, he\r\nmotioned to him for something to place in his mouth. The unfeeling\r\nfellow scrutinized the boy a moment, and then coolly turned his back\r\nupon him, and acted as though the supplication had not been made.\r\n\r\nHe was equally unsuccessful with the others, and the refusal of Shasta\r\nwas made in a most emphatic manner. Glaring at the boy like an enraged\r\ntiger, he brandished his knife and sprung toward him with such a\r\ncurdling yell that the youngster sprung trembling back to the furtherest\r\nverge of the cavern, and the eyes of the other Indians were all turned\r\ntoward the expected tragedy. But Elwood wasn't frightened--not a bit; he\r\nunderstood what it all meant.\r\n\r\nThe performance was followed by a conversation between Shasta and the\r\ntall Indian, who doubtless belonged to the Pah Utah nation or some tribe\r\nfriendly with them. It's precise import Elwood found impossible to\r\ndetermine, but he could not avoid a feeling of uneasiness when he saw by\r\nunmistakable signs that it referred to himself.\r\n\r\nIt looked very much as though Shasta was urging immediate disposal of\r\nthe prisoner, and his friend was strenuously maintaining a different\r\naction. The Pah Utah showed great excitement, very often turning and\r\ngesticulating toward Elwood, and once or twice he look a step or two in\r\nthat direction, as if he had resolved on a certain and speedy death for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFinally, he appeared to yield the point, and turned his back upon his\r\ndisputant and walked to the fire. As he did so his face was revealed\r\nalone to Elwood Brandon, and looking toward him, the boy again saw him\r\nplace his finger to his lips and give that warning expression, which\r\nsaid as plainly as words, \"Don't be frightened; all things are working\r\nright!\"\r\n\r\nThis was certainly gratifying, but our young friend was already\r\nsatisfied upon this point, and would have much preferred a more\r\nsubstantial mark of friendship in the shape of something to supply the\r\ncraving within. But on the very eve of despair he was delighted to see a\r\ncouple of Indians--whose absence he had noted for the last\r\nhalf-hour--return heavily laden with fish. These were immediately taken\r\nin charge, by Shasta, and the savor of them as they were cooking drove\r\nthe famishing boy almost frantic.\r\n\r\nWhile he sat with longing eyes, watching the motions of the cook, one of\r\nthe fat roasted fellows suddenly shot from his hand and fell into the\r\nlap of the boy. The Pah Utah did not raise his head, and the act looked\r\nas if it were a voluntary one upon the part of the fish to escape the\r\nhands of its tormentors--so dexterously was the whole thing done.\r\n\r\nElwood did not stop to thank his considerate friend, but devoured the\r\nfood precisely in the fashion that a boy attacks a pile of gingerbread\r\nwhich he has been expecting and longing for during a half-day. When he\r\nhad finished the fish, another in just as prime condition dropped into\r\nhis lap, apparently from the top of the cave above.\r\n\r\nThis satisfied his hunger, and he arose to his feet, casting his eyes\r\ntoward Shasta, and testifying by his looks the gratitude which he dare\r\nnot express audibly. He remained in the rear of the cavern, patiently\r\nwaiting the pleasure of the Pah Utah regarding himself.\r\n\r\nThe Indians completed their meal, and then exchanged a few words, when\r\nthey prepared to leave. Elwood watched them with interest, and when the\r\ntall fellow motioned for him to come forward, he did so with alacrity,\r\nand took him place in the rear of the line which was formed. Glancing\r\nback as they were about to start, he saw by the light of the fire that\r\nthe one immediately behind him was Shasta.\r\n\r\nThe night was utterly dark--above, below and all around. The hand of the\r\nPah Utah was placed upon his shoulder, as if to guide him aright, and\r\nthe march began.\r\n\r\nOf course it was impossible for Elwood to tell where he was going, but\r\nhe followed blindly the direction of him behind for a hundred yards,\r\nwhen he knew by the brushing of his hands against the sides that they\r\nwere passing through a narrow passage. All at once he felt himself\r\nseized by an iron grip from behind, lifted from his feet and tossed into\r\nthe air. He did not fall back in the path they were traversing, but lit\r\nlightly upon a ledge, where he concluded to remain until he heard\r\nfurther from the gentleman who had elevated him to that position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nWHAT SHASTA DID.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night was still, and the regular tramp of the Indians sounded like\r\nthe march of a file of soldiers, as they passed over the grass-covered\r\nearth. Elwood listened, hardly daring to breathe, as the tread grew\r\nfainter, fainter, fainter still, then died out; then was revived by a\r\nsigh of the night air, and all was still.\r\n\r\nThe boy raised his eyes and looked upward. Through the dark clouds\r\ndrifting tumultuously across the sky he detected the glimmer of a star\r\nor two, and in that moment of deep solemnity a passage of the Holy Bible\r\ncame to him.\r\n\r\n     \"They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no\r\n     city to dwell in.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Hungry and thirsty, their souls fainted in them.\"\r\n\r\n     \"When they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered\r\n     them out of their distress.\"\r\n\r\nIt came from his heart, and he repeated it over again.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful! How appropriate to the situation! The tears welled to his\r\neyes, and his heart overflowed at the repeated remembrance of the\r\nall-merciful Father, whose eye alone saw him and whose ear alone heard\r\nthe thankfulness that would find expression.\r\n\r\nHe fell into a sweet reverie, from which he was awakened by a slight\r\nnoise below. He leaned his head over the ledge and listened. All at once\r\nhe heard a soft rush, and the next moment an Indian was holding on to\r\nthe edge of the tabular-like projection with one hand, while his other\r\nwas outstretched and placed upon his body.\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Shasta?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oogh! Sh-e-asta!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right! I am waiting for you.\"\r\n\r\nThe hand closed upon his right arm; he was lifted bodily as if he were\r\nan infant, and held in mid-air; and the next instant the Pah Utah\r\ndropped lightly to the earth, and the two stood upon their feet. The\r\nIndian uttered an exclamation which seemed to be one of inquiry, and the\r\nboy made answer in this manner:\r\n\r\n\"I am ready for anything, Shasta; lead the way.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of allowing him to walk, as Elwood confidently expected, the Pah\r\nUtah flung him over his shoulder and then started on a long, loping trot\r\nup the path. His extraordinary agility and muscular power made the\r\nweight he carried of the same effect as if it were his rifle he was thus\r\ntransporting.\r\n\r\nThis rapid progress continued but a few minutes, when he sunk into a\r\nwalk--one of long strides, such as would have compelled the boy to a\r\nmoderate run to equal. He could tell that he was going up quite an\r\nascent, but toward what point it was impossible to tell. Occasionally\r\nhis hand or his foot struck the projecting rocks, and the rush of the\r\nwind now and then against his face told when they were passing through\r\nthe more open space.\r\n\r\nWonderful indeed was the skill of the Pah Utah, that in the dense\r\ndarkness showed him, just where and just the outlay of strength that\r\nwould land his young white friend upon the shelf of safety. Equally\r\nextraordinary was the woodcraft that brought him back to the precise\r\nspot, and enabled him to thread his way through the impenetrable gloom\r\nwith the surety of the mountain chamois, which bounds over the\r\nfastnesses of the Alps at midday.\r\n\r\nElwood was quiescent, for he know whose hand held him upon those brawny\r\nshoulders, and he felt that the moccasined foot which touched the earth\r\nso lightly was too sure to miss its hold, and the heart throbbing within\r\nthat dusky bosom pulsated too powerfully with the common humanity of our\r\nnature ever to falter or hesitate in its work of love.\r\n\r\nThis singular means of progress was continued for the better part of an\r\nhour, when the Indian paused and placed him gently on his feet. The sky,\r\nwhich had partially cleared, enabled him to see that they had emerged\r\nfrom the ridge of hills whose entrance had been so eventful to him, and\r\nthey now stood in the open woods.\r\n\r\nElwood Brandon admitted to himself that the work of Shasta was now\r\nfinished, and he fully expected to be left alone in the forest to seek\r\nhis way back to his friends; but if _he_ thought so the Pah Utah\r\ncertainly did not.\r\n\r\nEven in that moment the boy could not fail to notice that the Indian's\r\nbreathing could not be heard. Not the slightest panting nor exhaustion\r\nfrom the tremendous exertion undergone!\r\n\r\nShasta waited but a moment, and then gripping Elwood by the wrist he\r\nbegan threading his way through the forest. As he did so, instead of\r\nallowing the youngster to walk by his side, he held his arm backward, so\r\nthat to all intents and purposes the boy was following behind him, and\r\nyet at such an angle that their feet did not interfere with each other.\r\n\r\nNot once did either the Pah Utah or his dependent strike a tree. Often\r\ndid they graze the back, and brush through the limbs and undergrowth,\r\nbut the uplifted arm of the Indian parted asunder the obstructions, and\r\nopened the way, as does the snow plow of the locomotive to the engine\r\nthat drives it forward and the train coming behind.\r\n\r\nWhether the marvelous vision of the Pah Utah penetrated the Egyptian\r\ndarkness or not, cannot be said. The veteran backwoodsman, as he strides\r\nthrough the midnight forest, seems to _feel_ the presence of each\r\ntree-trunk as he approaches it, just as the fingers of pianists strike\r\nthe piano keys with such bewildering certainty, without their once\r\nlooking at them.\r\n\r\nOnward they pressed, Elwood only now and then able to catch a glimpse of\r\nhis faithful guide, who never vouchsafed a word or exclamation for his\r\nbenefit. There was no need of it. Both fully understood each other, and\r\nthe boy did not attempt to divert the attention which was so needed, at\r\nthe present time, for the work before him.\r\n\r\nFinally Shasta seemed to hesitate--not the hesitation of doubt and\r\nuncertainty, but as if he had neared if not reached his destination, and\r\nhad slackened his pace that he might not pass the exact point.\r\n\r\nHe was not long in finding the proper spot, and Elwood could see that he\r\nwas stooping down and busy at something. While he was closely\r\nscrutinizing him, he suddenly became aware that they stood beside the\r\nriver, and the Pah Utah was engaged with his canoe. It occupied him but\r\na moment, when he turned around, lifted the boy over and laid him down\r\nupon the blanket which was spread over the bottom of the boat, the\r\nremainder was folded carefully around his body, and then the Indian\r\nstood back, as if to command his young friend to go to sleep without any\r\ndelay or questioning.\r\n\r\nThe boy had lain but a short time when he found the blanket so\r\nintolerably warm that he threw a portion from him. It was instantly and\r\nrather roughly replaced--evidence that Shasta meant that his wishes\r\nshould be obeyed. At any rate the boy thought so, and dared not repeat\r\nthe act.\r\n\r\nThe great warmth of the blanket caused Elwood to break out into a\r\ncopious perspiration from head to foot, and caused him almost to gasp\r\nfor breath; but when he seemed only to meditate on relieving himself of\r\nthe superabundant clothing, the dusky watcher leaned forward to see\r\nwhether he dared violate his implied commands. It looked very much as\r\nthough the Pah Utah was acting as a physician to his youthful friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nSTILL WAITING.\r\n\r\n\r\nTim O'Rooney and Howard Lawrence, after making their way out of the\r\nrange of hills to the river-side, where their canoe lay, waited until\r\ndark, in accordance with their agreement, before venturing out upon the\r\nriver. They were quite uneasy, and to prevent their trail revealing them\r\nthey dropped a few hundred yards down the shore, where they awaited the\r\ncoming of darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Worrah! worrah!\" said Tim with an immense sigh, \"this is a bad day when\r\nwe came to leave the youngster with the rid gintleman. A fine youngster\r\nwas the same--bowld and presumin'. It's a qua'ar failin', Masther\r\nHoward, that comes to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am sad enough, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! but it is not exactly that be the towken of another faaling\r\nintirely.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whin it's yourself that is lost and awandtherin' off by yourself all\r\nalone, and nobody with yees, then I thinks it's yees that I loves more\r\nnor him that stays with me. But now, whin it's Elwood--God bless\r\nhim!--that's gone, he's dearer to me than all the rest of the world, not\r\nexceptin' yourself. But,\" and Tim scratched his head in great\r\nperplexity, \"it's the same that puzzles me sorely. Could yees be afther\r\naccounting for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Elwood and I both know that you think a great deal of us, and no doubt\r\nit is because your affection is so equally divided.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it. Yees have made it all plain. I likes each of yees more than\r\nthe other, and both of yees a great deal the most, whither be the towken\r\nof takin' yees apart or together, or takin' both of yees separate, and\r\nalso wid each other.\"\r\n\r\nTim nodded his head again and again, as if to signify that it was clear\r\nto his mind. Perhaps it was; but if so, one may doubt whether it was as\r\nclearly expressed.\r\n\r\n\"There's another thing that troubles me,\" added the Irishman, with one\r\nof those great inhalations of breath which seem to fill the entire\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me pipe has gone out, and I hasn't the maans convanient to relight it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a small infliction which you can well afford to bear. I am only\r\nanxious for the night, that we may speed on our way home to get\r\nassistance for poor Elwood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, if it's bist.\"\r\n\r\nAnd just in that exclamation Tim O'Rooney echoed the sentiments of his\r\ncompanion. Ever since leaving the range of hills, with the resolve to\r\nhurry away in search of help, the question had been constantly rising in\r\nhis mind: \"Is it best to do so?\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to put it out of hearing, with the determination that he had\r\nalready decided; but, as if it were the pleadings of conscience, it\r\nwould not be stifled, and it came again and again, until when Tim spoke\r\nit seemed almost as loud as his.\r\n\r\n\"I can't make up my mind about that,\" said he. \"When we left the hills I\r\nhad not a moment's doubt but that he was in the hands of the Indians,\r\nwhere there was great danger of our getting ourselves; but then we are\r\nnot sure of it, and suppose we go away and leave him wandering through\r\nthe woods until he is captured or is obliged to give himself up to keep\r\nfrom starving. I imagine him following along the shore of the river\r\nlooking for us----\"\r\n\r\n\"There! there! do yez shtop! No more for me; I've plenty,\" and the\r\nIrishman drew his sleeve across his eyes, as if he were wiping an undue\r\naccumulation of moisture, while Howard Brandon was scarcely less\r\naffected at the touching picture which he had drawn, and which he felt\r\nmight be realized from his own remissness.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I cannot tell which is for the best,\" he added in great\r\nperplexity. \"If a prisoner, he may be able to get away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, yees are right; some dark night he can give the owld haythen the\r\nslip, and make thracks for the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who knows but he has been able to elude them, and is only waiting\r\nuntil dark to hunt us up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yez are right agin; I was about to obsarve the same myself.\"\r\n\r\nThere was one view of the case, which if it did occasionally force\r\nitself upon the attention of Howard, he resolutely refused to utter a\r\nreference to it. It was that Elwood had been killed accidentally, or by\r\nthe savages. That was too terrible a contingency to take definite shape\r\nuntil there was no escaping it, and as all of us know better we won't\r\nrefer to it again.\r\n\r\n\"Then he may be in the power of these wandering Indians that took such\r\nan interest in the antelope we left lying down among the rocks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis; yez are correct sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it, Tim, that you agree with every supposition I make, no matter\r\nbow different they are from each other?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, you saas me mind is a little foggy, be the towken that I hasn't\r\nhad the pipe atween me lips since yesterday. When I'm deprived of that\r\npleasure I finds meself unable to reason clearly.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the first time I have heard that smoke makes a thing clearer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that's the trouble,\" added Tim, with a desponding shake of his\r\nhead. \"If this bad state of things continyees fur a few days longer,\r\nyees'll have to laad me around wid a string, or else taach Terror to do\r\nthe same, as yez have saan a poor blind man and his dog do.\"\r\n\r\n\"You draw rather a woeful picture of yourself. But I suppose you can\r\nhold out for a few hours longer, and when it becomes dark, we can make a\r\nfire, light your pipe and get far away from it before any of the Indians\r\ncould reach the spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think yez are right, but me intellect is working so faably this\r\nafternoon, that I faars to tax it too hard lest it topples over and gits\r\nupsit intirely. Yis, yez are right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Somehow or other I think Shasta is in this neighborhood----\"\r\n\r\n\"So does meself,\" interrupted Tim, in his anxiety to give assent.\r\n\r\n\"If he is, he will not forget the kindness of Elwood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\"\r\n\r\n\"And whether we wait here or not he will attend to his safety all the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\n\"That he will--you may depend on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then shall we wait here or hurry down the river for help?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both, or aither as yez plaise.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Tim, we must do one or the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us slaap and draam over it.\"\r\n\r\nThis struck Howard as a good suggestion, as they both needed slumber\r\nsorely, and adjusting themselves in the canoe, with the Newfoundland as\r\never maintaining guard, they were quickly wrapped in deep slumber.\r\n\r\nWhen they awoke it was broad day, and the whining of the dog told them\r\nat once that he had detected something suspicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MEETING.\r\n\r\n\r\nTim O'Rooney and Howard Lawrence, awaking at the same moment, observed\r\nthe alarming action of the dog. Raising their heads they looked\r\ncarefully around but could detect nothing unusual. They were so securely\r\ndrawn under the overhanging shrubbery and undergrowth that they were\r\npretty certain no one else was aware of their presence; but the gaze of\r\nthe dog being turned toward the river they judged that something must be\r\nnearing them from that direction.\r\n\r\nNor were they mistaken. A slight ripple was heard, and the next moment a\r\ncanoe glided to view. In the center, controlling its movements, sat\r\nShasta, the Pah Utah, and directly behind was Elwood Brandon.\r\n\r\nHoward could scarcely believe his eyes. He stared again and again, while\r\nTim rubbed his organs of vision, winked and blinked, as though vainly\r\nseeking to recover from the bewilderment of a sudden awaking from sleep.\r\nFinally he muttered to himself:\r\n\r\n\"Heaven save me! me intellect has toppled over intirely by raison of the\r\nwant of me pipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Elwood! Elwood!\" called Howard, leaning forward and pulling the bushes\r\napart.\r\n\r\nBut secure as they deemed their concealment, the eagle eyes of the Pah\r\nUtah had penetrated it, while they were yet several rods apart, and\r\nabruptly turning the prow of his canoe to one side, he brought it to\r\nrest directly opposite and within two feet of the other boat.\r\n\r\nElwood heard his name and saw his friends the next instant. Reaching\r\nforward, he grasped the hands of his cousin and the tears trickled down\r\ntheir smiling faces, while Tim continued rubbing his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Am I draaming? as me uncle said when they towld him his grandfather had\r\ndied and willed him two pounds and a half, or does I raaly see before me\r\nthe youngster that the rid gintlemin had burned up? Let me faal the baal\r\nof yer hand.\"\r\n\r\nThe two closed hands, and the joy of both was unbounded. Shasta, at this\r\npoint, showed a delicacy of feeling that did his heart credit. Joining\r\nthe canoes together in the old-fashioned manner, he motioned Elwood to\r\nenter that of his friends, while he gave his exclusive attention to that\r\nof propelling the two.\r\n\r\nOf course, now that the three were reunited, they overran each other\r\nwith questions, exclamations and the interchange of experiences since\r\nthey had separated. It did not require much time for the voluble tongue\r\nof Elwood to rattle on his brief stay with the Indians and the\r\nremarkable manner in which Shasta had secured his escape. Howard had but\r\nlittle to tell, and that was soon given, and they were left to speculate\r\nand conjecture on the future.\r\n\r\nTim's joy drowned his craving for his tobacco, and as he joined in the\r\nglowing conversation of the boys he made no reference to it.\r\n\r\n\"I think for the prisent,\" he remarked, \"we won't take any hunts upon\r\nshore, especially if aich of us has to go alone. The red gintlemen, for\r\nsome raisin at all, or more likely without any raisin, have taken a\r\ngreat anxiety to make our acquaintance. As fur meself, I prefers to live\r\nupon fish to having these same fellows faading upon me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Elwood, \"I have learned something during the last few\r\ndays. It is all well enough to be reckless and careless about danger\r\nwhen we are at home and there is no danger, but it is another thing when\r\nwe are in these parts.\"\r\n\r\n\"As the Frenchman remarked, 'tiger hunting is very fine so long as we\r\nhunt the tiger, but when he takes it into his head to hunt us the\r\nmischief is to pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Shasta will have the onspakable kindness to tow us along in this\r\nshtyle for a few waaks, I think we will cast anchor at the wharf in San\r\nFrancisco without any loss to passingers and freight.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has seen what ninnies we were,\" said Elwood, \"and no doubt will\r\naccompany us some distance further when he certainly ought to let us try\r\nit alone again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! but he's a smart young gintleman, as the acquaintances of Tim\r\nO'Rooney used to say when they made the slightest reference to him.\r\nCouldn't we persuade him to go on to San Francisco wid us? I think your\r\nfather would be plaised to take him in as a partner in their business\r\nwid them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But _he_ would hardly fancy the change,\" laughed Howard.\r\n\r\n\"He might now. When we should state the sarvices he has rindered to us,\r\nit's meself that doesn't think they'd require him to put in a very large\r\npile of capital.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure if he should prove as keen and sharp in business matters as\r\nhe does in the way of the woods, he would make one of the most\r\nsuccessful merchants in the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a pity that he doesn't understand the illegant use of the tongue,\r\nthat we might confaar wid him. We could lay the proposition forninst\r\nhim, and he could gives us the tarms to carry wid us.\"\r\n\r\nHowever philanthropic this might be as regarded the Pah Utah, our\r\nfriends deemed it hardly feasible to make the attempt to reach his views\r\nthrough the medium of signs.\r\n\r\nAs for Shasta, he did not once look backward to observe what his\r\npassengers were doing. He was propelling his boat through the water with\r\nhis usual celerity, his head occasionally turning slightly as he glanced\r\nfirst at one shore and then the other, as though looking for some sign\r\nor landmark.\r\n\r\nThe day that succeeded the storm was beautiful and clear, everything in\r\nnature wearing a fresh and rosy look, as if refreshed by the needed\r\nshower. The current of the Salinas was as clear and crystal-like as\r\nthough it had not received the muddy contents of a thousand brooks,\r\nrivulets and torrents gorged with the debris and leaves of its own\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\n\"I am troubled by one sore anxiety.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can that be?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is for Mr. Shasta. He seems quite forgetful this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what respect?\" asked Elwood, who did not see the drift of the\r\nIrishman's remarks.\r\n\r\n\"He hasn't had his breakfast, and he must be faaling a wee bit hungry,\r\nand be the same token, he must be the victim of great distress, that he\r\nhasn't indulged in the use of his pipe.\"\r\n\r\nAs Tim O'Rooney had made similar remarks on more than one previous\r\noccasion, it may be that the Pah Utah gathered an inkling of his\r\nmeaning, for the words were scarce uttered when the canoes were headed\r\ntoward shore, and a landing speedily made.\r\n\r\nA piscatorial meal was provided after the manner already fully given,\r\nand when finished the soothing pipe of Tim O'Rooney was produced and\r\nenjoyed to its full extent.\r\n\r\nBut Shasta showed no disposition to wait, or to indulge in the solace of\r\nthe weed. Motioning to his friends to enter the boat, he towed them to\r\nthe center of the river, where he loosed the fastenings, and without a\r\nword or sign he headed his canoe up stream and sped away.\r\n\r\n\"He is going home,\" said Howard.\r\n\r\n\"He must imagine that we are owld enough to walk alone,\" remarked Tim as\r\nhe took the paddle.\r\n\r\n\"But why not bid us good-by?\" asked Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"As he has already done so,\" replied Howard, \"he doubtless does not\r\nbelieve in adding a postscript.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nHOMEWARD BOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that our friends were left entirely alone, it became a question\r\nwhether they should continue journeying by day or night.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that we are approaching a more civilized part of the\r\ncountry,\" said Howard. \"I think there will be little risk in continuing\r\nour journey.\"\r\n\r\nTim industriously used his paddle, and shortly afterward, Elwood pointed\r\nto an open space some distance inland.\r\n\r\n\"Yonder are people, and they look as if they were gathered around a\r\ncamp-fire at their dinner.\"\r\n\r\nTim jerked his head around, gave a puff of his pipe and said:\r\n\r\n\"Rid gintlemen ag'in, and I'll shy the canoe under the bank, and craap\r\nalong till we gets beyonst thim.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they are not Indians--they are white men,\" quickly added Elwood.\r\n\r\nA careful scrutiny by all ended in a confirmation of Elwood's suspicion.\r\n\r\n\"That is good,\" said Howard, with a pleased expression, \"it shows that\r\nwe are getting beyond the wild country into a neighborhood where white\r\nmen abound, and where we can feel some degree of safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose they are miners or hunters who are taking their midday meal\r\nin the open air,\" added Elwood, who was still gazing at them.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we heave too, pitch over the anchor, and s'lute them?\" asked Tim.\r\n\r\n\"No; go ahead, we have no time to spare.\"\r\n\r\nThe cheering signs continued. An hour later they descried several white\r\nmen seated in canoes and fishing near shore. They exchanged the\r\ncourtesies of the day with them and passed on, growing more eager as\r\nthey neared the goal.\r\n\r\nIt would have been no difficult feat of the imagination for one standing\r\non shore to fancy that the cause was a pocket edition of a Hudson River\r\nsteamboat, so powerfully did Tim O'Rooney puff at his pipe, the whiffs\r\nspeeding away over his shoulder in exact time with the dipping of the\r\npaddle, as though the two united cause and effect. The fellow was in the\r\nbest of spirits. Suddenly he paused and commenced sucking desperately at\r\nhis pipe-stem, but all in vain; no smoke was emitted.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"Steam is out, and the paddle won't go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me relieve you.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy used it with good effect, while Tim shoved his blunt finger into\r\nthe pipe-bowl, shut one eye and squinted into it, rattled it on his\r\nhand, puffed at it again, turned his pockets wrong side out, then put\r\nthem to rights, and repeated the operation, just as we open the door a\r\nhalf-dozen times to make sure our friend isn't behind it, then gave one\r\nof his great sighs and looked toward Howard.\r\n\r\n\"I put the last switch of tobaccy I had in the world into that pipe,\r\njust arter throwing myself outside of that quince of fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quience?\" laughed the boy, \"you mean _quintal_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, and what's to come of Tim O'Rooney, if he doesn't git some more\r\nright spaddily. His intellect toppled all the mornin', and can't stand\r\nanother such strain, or it'll be nipped in the bud afore it has reached\r\nthe topmost round at the bar of fame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Tim, you are growing poetical,\" called Elwood over his shoulder,\r\nnot a little amused at his bewildering metaphors.\r\n\r\n\"We shall doubtless come across some friends before long who will be\r\nglad to supply you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Elwood!\" called Tim.\r\n\r\n\"What is it!\" he asked, pausing in his paddling.\r\n\r\n\"If you saas a rid gintleman do yez jist rist till I takes aim and\r\nshoots him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so blood-thirsty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not blood-thirsty, but tobaccy thirsty. The haythen deal in the\r\narticle, and if we saas one he must yield.\"\r\n\r\nElwood promised obedience, but they saw nothing of the coveted people\r\nwhom they had been so anxious to avoid hitherto, but a half-hour later\r\nHoward said:\r\n\r\n\"Heigh-ho! Yonder is just the man you want to see!\"\r\n\r\nA single person dressed in the garb of a miner was standing on the shore\r\nleisurely surveying them as they came along. There could be no doubt\r\nthat he was supplied with the noxious weed, for he was smoking a pipe\r\nwith all the cool, deliberate enjoyment of a veteran at the business.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I head toward shore!\" asked Elwood.\r\n\r\n\"Sartin, sartin. Oh that we had Mr. Shasta here that he might hurry to\r\nland wid the ould canoe!\"\r\n\r\nA few minutes sufficed to place the prow of the boat against the shore,\r\nand Tim O'Rooney sprung out. The miner, if such he was, stood with his\r\nhands in his pockets, looking sleepily at the stranger.\r\n\r\n\"How do yez do, William?\" reaching out and shaking the hand which was\r\nrather reluctantly given him.\r\n\r\n\"Who you calling William?\" demanded the miner gruffly.\r\n\r\n\"I beg yez pardon, but it was a slip of the tongue, Thomas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who you calling Thomas?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is your family well, my dear sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whose family you talking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did yez lave the wife and childer well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whose wife and childer you talking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yez got over the cowld yez had the other day?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Pears to me you know a blamed sight more about me than I do,\r\nstranger.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir, I have the greatest affection for yez. The moment I seen\r\nyez a qua'ar faaling come over me, and I filt I must come ashore and\r\nshake you by the hand. I faals much better.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I does. Would yez have the kindness to give me a wee bit of\r\ntobaccy?\"\r\n\r\nThe sleepy-looking stranger gazed drowsily at him a moment and then made\r\nanswer:\r\n\r\n\"I'm just smoking the last bit I've got. I was going to ax you for some,\r\nbeing you had such a great affection for me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nRESCUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe miner having made his reply, turned on his heel, still smoking his\r\npipe, and coolly walked away, while Tim O'Rooney gazed after him in\r\namazement. The boys were amused spectators of the scene, and Elwood now\r\ncalled out.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Tim, don't wait! We shall meet somebody else before long; and as\r\nyou have just had a good smoking spell, you can certainly wait a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" added Howard, \"no good can come of waiting; so jump in and let's\r\nbe off.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irishman obeyed like a child which hardly understood what was\r\nrequired of it, and taking his seat said never a word.\r\n\r\n\"Let me alternate with you for a while,\" said Howard to his cousin, \"you\r\nhave worked quite a while with the paddle.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not tired, but if you are eager to try your skill I won't object.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys changed places, and while Howard gave his exclusive attention\r\nto the management of the canoe, Elwood devoid himself to consoling Tim\r\nO'Rooney in the most serio-comic manner.\r\n\r\n\"Bear up a little longer, my good fellow. There's plenty of tobacco in\r\nthe country, and there must be some that is waiting expressly for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where bees the same?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we are to find that out; and I haven't the least doubt but\r\nthe way will appear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Elwood,\" sighed Tim, \"'spose by towken of the severe suffering that\r\nmeself is undergoing I should lose me intellect----\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think there's any danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\" demanded the Irishman, in assumed fierceness.\r\n\r\n\"For the good reason that you haven't any to lose.\"\r\n\r\nTim bowed his head in graceful acknowledgment.\r\n\r\n\"But suppose I does run mad for all that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can easily dispose of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Afther what shtyle?\"\r\n\r\n\"A madman is always a dangerous person in the community, and the moment\r\nI see any signs of your malady all I have to do is to shoot you through\r\nthe head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do yez obsarve any signs at presint?\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't ask the question, for the moment it breaks out the report\r\nof the gun and the crash of the bullet will give you a hint of the\r\ntrouble.\"\r\n\r\nTim laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Yez are a bright child, as me mother used to obsarve whin I'd wash me\r\nface in her buttermilk and smiled through the windy at her. If ye\r\ncontinues to grow in your intellect yez may come to be a man that I\r\nwon't be ashamed to addriss and take by the hand when I maats yez in the\r\nstraats.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope I shall,\" laughed Elwood, \"the prize that you hold out is enough\r\nto make any boy work as he never did before. I hope you will not wish to\r\nwithdraw your offer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Niver a faar--niver a faar, as Bridget Mughalligan said, when I asked\r\nher if she'd be kind enough to remimber me for a few days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tim,\" added Elwood, after a moment's silence, \"we are out of the\r\nwoods.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do yez maan by that?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can see signs of the presence of white men all around us, and we\r\nhave nothing further to fear from Indians.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point Howard called the attention of his companion to a large\r\ncanoe which was coming around a curve in the river. It contained nearly\r\na dozen men, and was the largest boat of the kind which they had ever\r\nseen, and savored also of a civilized rather than a savage architect.\r\n\r\n\"They are white men,\" said Howard.\r\n\r\n\"Do yez obsarve any pipes sticking out of their mouths?\"\r\n\r\n\"One or two are smoking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then boord them if they won't surrender.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have headed toward us,\" remarked Elwood, \"and must wish to say\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments later the two boats came side by side, and before any one\r\nelse could speak Tim made his request known for tobacco. This was\r\nfurnished him, and as he relit his pipe he announced that he had no\r\nobjection to their proceeding with their business.\r\n\r\nThere were nine men in the larger boat, and all were armed with pistols,\r\nrifles and knives. In truth they resembled a war party more than\r\nanything else bound upon some desperate expedition.\r\n\r\nThe boys noticed as they came along, and while Tim O'Rooney was\r\nspeaking, that several of the men looked very keenly at them, as though\r\nthey entertained some strong suspicion. Finally one of the men asked:\r\n\r\n\"Are you youngsters named Lawrence and Brandon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHere the questioner produced a paper from his pocket, and seemed to read\r\nhis questions from that.\r\n\r\n\"And is that man Timothy O'Rooney?\"\r\n\r\n\"Timothy O'Rooney, Esquire, from Tipperary, at your sarvice,\" called out\r\nthe Irishman from the stern of the canoe, where he was elegantly\r\nreclining, and without removing the pipe from his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Were you on the steamer ---- ---- that was burned off the coast of\r\nCalifornia?\" pursued the interlocutor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you are just the party we are looking for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are from San Francisco, sent out by Messrs. Lawrence and Brandon in\r\nsearch of their children, whom they learned a few days ago from Mr.\r\nYard, one of the survivors, were left on the coast, having wandered\r\ninland at the time the others were taken off by the Relief.\"\r\n\r\nThis was to the point.\r\n\r\n\"It is fortunate for all parties that we met you,\" added the man with a\r\nsmile, \"for we receive a very liberal reward to bring you back, no\r\nmatter whether we met you within a dozen miles of San Francisco, or were\r\nobliged to spend the summer hunting for you among the mountains, only to\r\nsucceed after giving the largest kind of a ransom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prosaad,\" said Tim O'Rooney, with a magnificent wave of his hand,\r\nwithout rising from his reclining position. \"We're glad to maat yez, as\r\nme uncle obsarved, whin Micky O'Shaunhanaley's pig walked into his\r\nshanty and stood still till he was salted down and stowed away in the\r\nbarrel, by raisin of which Micky niver found his pig agin.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day the party reached the outlet of the Salinas River, Monterey\r\nBay, where they succeeded in securing transit to San Francisco, and the\r\ntwo boys were once more clasped in the loving arms of their anxious\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nHoward and Elwood remained in San Francisco until autumn, when they came\r\nEast again and entered college, and having passed through with honor\r\nthey returned to the Golden City, and are now partners in a flourishing\r\nbusiness. Tim O'Rooney is in their service, and they both hold him in\r\ngreat regard. He is as good-natured as when \"Adrift in the Wilds\" with\r\nthe boys, and his greatest grief is that he has never been able to meet\r\nMr. Shasta, the most \"illigent savage gintleman that iver paddled his\r\nown canoe.\"\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOYS' HOME SERIES.\r\n\r\nUniform with this Volume.\r\n\r\nThis series affords wholesome reading for boys and girls, and all the\r\nvolumes are extremely interesting.--_Cincinnati Commercial Gazette._\r\n\r\nJoe's Luck; or, A Boy's Adventures in California.
