The existence of a specific contagious disease causing abortion in\r\ncows has been recognized for a long time, and it is certain that the\r\ndisease known abroad as infectious or contagious abortion is also\r\nprevalent in the United States.\r\n\r\n2. The infectious agent is a bacterium first described by the Danish\r\ninvestigators, Bang and Stribolt. This microorganism has been isolated\r\nfrom aborting cows in various European countries and in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n3. Bacteriological examination of afterbirths from aborting cows at this\r\nStation revealed the presence of this germ.\r\n\r\n4. To eradicate the disease from a herd, the affected cows should be\r\nisolated, and their genital passages cleansed once or twice daily with\r\nan antiseptic solution until all discharge has ceased, when they may be\r\nreturned to the herd; all infectious material (afterbirth and\r\ndischarges) should be burned; infected stalls should be cleaned and\r\ndisinfected; the sheath of the herd bull should be cleansed with a\r\ndisinfectant solution before and after service, and a separate, clean\r\nbull should be used for heifers and clean cows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTAGIOUS ABORTION OF COWS\r\n\r\nBY W. J. MACNEAL, ASSISTANT CHIEF IN BACTERIOLOGY, IN COOPERATION\r\nWITH HERBERT W. MUMFORD, CHIEF IN ANIMAL HUSBANDRY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe premature discharge of the products of conception from the uterus is\r\na not infrequent occurrence among domestic animals, and doubtless\r\nvarious factors may from time to time operate in its causation. For a\r\nlong time, however, practical husbandmen have recognized an epizootic or\r\ncontagious kind of abortion, a definite transmissible disease in which\r\nthe loss of the fetus is the most prominent characteristic. The\r\ntransmissibility of contagious abortion of cows appears to have been\r\ndemonstrated experimentally for the first time by Brauer. Experimental\r\ntransmission has been performed by a number of investigators\r\nsubsequently, the work of Nocard (1886) furnishing conclusive evidence\r\nupon this point.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that a disease, or possibly more than one disease, of this\r\nnature is a source of serious loss to the live stock industry in the\r\nUnited States, and there can no longer be any doubt that a considerable\r\npart of this loss is due to the definite specific disease prevalent on\r\nthe continent of Europe and in England, and known as Contagious,\r\nInfectious, or Epizootic Abortion. The purpose of this bulletin is the\r\nbrief presentation of some of the facts concerning the cause, prevention\r\nand restriction of this disease, which have been established by modern\r\ninvestigation, for the information of men engaged in live stock\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTERIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS ELSEWHERE\r\n\r\nNocard carried out the first extensive bacteriological investigation of\r\ncontagious abortion. In microscopic preparations of the diseased\r\nplacenta he was able to recognize numerous short bacilli and micrococci.\r\nThese were also found in the amniotic fluid. He obtained pure cultures\r\nof these two organisms, but failed to induce abortion upon inoculating\r\nthese cultures into other animals. Neither of the germs obtained in\r\nculture could therefore be regarded as the causative agent in the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Bang and Stribolt undertook the investigation of this disease,\r\nand their results are now generally regarded as the most important of\r\nall the contributions to the study of this subject. A cow showing all\r\nthe symptoms of impending abortion was purchased and slaughtered. The\r\nunopened uterus was removed to the laboratory where it was opened with\r\nspecial precautions to avoid all contamination. An abundant, grayish\r\nyellow, odorless exudate was found between the ovum and the inner wall\r\nof the uterus. Upon standing this exudate separated into two layers, a\r\nreddish yellow serum above, and a grayish yellow partly solid layer\r\nbelow. In microscopic preparations of this exudate, stained with\r\nLoeffler's methylene blue, numerous very small bacilli were found,\r\napparently in pure culture, some of them lying free, but large numbers\r\nof them crowded together inside cells. These latter appeared at first to\r\nbe micrococci, but more careful examination proved them to be really\r\nshort rods. Bang and Stribolt were able to cultivate this organism in\r\ntubes of a gelatin-agar-serum medium, the germ developing only in a\r\nparticular zone beginning about 5 mm. beneath the surface of the medium\r\nand extending downward 10 to 15 mm. After considerable work with\r\ncultures, they concluded that the bacillus is neither an aerobe nor an\r\nanaerobe, in the ordinary sense, but exhibits a very peculiar behavior\r\nin respect to oxygen, requiring for its development a partial pressure\r\nof oxygen somewhat less than that present in the atmosphere. They were\r\nunable to obtain growth of the germ in the presence of the ordinary\r\natmosphere, nor in the absence of oxygen (Pyrogallol method). Curiously\r\nenough, by placing their tube cultures in an atmosphere of pure oxygen,\r\nthey obtained cultures developing in two zones, one near the top and the\r\nother near the bottom of the tube, indicating that there are two optima\r\nin the oxygen requirement of the organism. This very interesting\r\ncharacter of the organism received great attention at their hands, but\r\nnevertheless Bang points out that typical development such as he has\r\npictured was not always obtained, a number of factors seeming to cause\r\nvariation in the position and extent of the developmental zones in these\r\ntube cultures. By exhausting the air above the medium in the tube, the\r\ngrowth was made to extend to the surface. In this way they were able to\r\nobtain growth of the bacillus on plates, but they did not work out a\r\nreliable plate method, preferring to employ the dilution tube cultures\r\nfor separation in all their work. Bang and Stribolt subsequently\r\nexamined pieces of placenta from a large number of cases of contagious\r\nabortion, and found the bacillus microscopically in practically all\r\ncases. Sometimes they were abundant, in other instances very scarce.\r\nMost of this material was badly contaminated, yet, from that sent in\r\nduring the colder season they successfully isolated the bacillus in pure\r\nculture in a majority of the cases. In three fetuses the bacillus was\r\nfound in the intestinal contents in pure culture; in one fetus it was\r\nisolated from the blood. Two cows with mummified fetus _in utero_ were\r\nexamined _post mortem_. These fetuses had been dead 9 months and 5\r\nmonths respectively but the surrounding exudate still contained the\r\nabortion bacillus and pure cultures of it were obtained from each case.\r\nUterine exudate kept in the refrigerator still contained living abortion\r\nbacilli after seven months.\r\n\r\nHaving found the same bacillus microscopically in a series of cases of\r\nabortion, and having obtained it in pure culture from a number of them,\r\nit now remained for Bang and Stribolt to produce the disease by\r\ninoculation of these cultures into healthy animals. Four pregnant cows\r\nwere obtained without knowledge of their previous history. Two of them\r\nwere inoculated by intravaginal application of pure cultures, and two by\r\nintravaginal application of pieces of afterbirth from aborting cows. No\r\nabortion resulted in any of the cows and at slaughter 19 to 29 days\r\nafter inoculation, there was no evidence of the disease. This result was\r\nsurprising, as Brauer had induced abortion by the second of the\r\nabove-mentioned procedures in from 9 to 21 days, Lehnert in from 12 to\r\n20 days, and Trinchera in 9 to 13 days. The authors thought that the\r\nanimals may have been immune on account of a previous attack of the\r\ndisease, or that possibly the interval between innoculation and\r\nslaughter (19 to 29 days) may have been too brief for the disease to\r\nhave developed. For the next experiment two cows were purchased from a\r\nregion where abortion was unknown. Pregnancy began January 14 and\r\nJanuary 16, 1896. On April 14, a rich culture of the abortion bacillus\r\nwas injected well up into the anterior end of the vaginal canal of each\r\nof these cows. The inoculation was repeated in the same way on May 23,\r\nand again on June 4. One cow aborted June 24, the fetus evidently having\r\nbeen dead some days. The abortion bacillus was isolated from the\r\nafterbirth. The other cow showed the signs of impending abortion on June\r\n23, and was slaughtered on June 24. The condition inside the uterus\r\nresembled in every respect that observed in the cow from which the\r\noriginal culture had been isolated, and the bacillus was present in pure\r\nculture. In these cows the disease had appeared 10 weeks after the first\r\ninoculation. A third cow was inoculated by intravaginal application\r\nJanuary 19, 1897, and subcutaneously March 6, in both instances with\r\npure cultures of the bacillus. Premature delivery of a living calf\r\noccurred April 9, 80 days after the first inoculation. Abortion was also\r\ncaused in sheep by intravaginal application and by intravenous injection\r\nof pure cultures. Inoculation by the latter method proved to be more\r\ncertain in these animals, and the incubation period after intravenous\r\ninjection was only 7 days in one case and 12 days in another.\r\nIntravenous inoculation of a mare resulted in a premature delivery after\r\n28 days. In all these cases the bacillus was recovered from the\r\nafterbirth.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, Preisz at Budapest isolated the same bacillus from two cases of\r\ncontagious abortion in cows. He confirmed the findings of Bang in\r\nrespect to the oxygen requirements of the organism, and was able to\r\nobtain cultures by a variety of methods on ordinary media. Apparently\r\nhis cultures were less vigorous than those of Bang, for they soon died\r\nout, their resistance to germicides was slight, and all his\r\ninoculations into animals, including two pregnant cows, two pregnant\r\nguinea pigs, and one pregnant rabbit, as well as a number of other small\r\nanimals, were without positive result. Preisz named the organism\r\n\"_Corynebacterium abortus endemici (s. infectiosi)_.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1908, Nowak at the University of Krakau in Austria made a very\r\nimportant contribution to the study of this disease. He found the\r\nculture method of Bang and Stribolt very useful for the identification\r\nof the organism when obtainable in pure culture, and when the\r\ncontaminating bacteria were few in number. When other bacteria were\r\nnumerous, as is frequently the case in material obtained for\r\nexamination, he found this method difficult. The pyrogallol method of\r\nPreisz also proved to be unreliable in his hands. Eventually he devised\r\na method of plate culture which proved to be very useful. Ordinary agar\r\nwas melted and cooled to 50 deg. C. then mixed with about one fourth its\r\nvolume of naturally sterile blood serum, and poured into sterile Petri\r\ndishes where it was allowed to solidify. The piece of placenta or other\r\nmaterial to be examined was then streaked over several of these plates\r\nin succession, and the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 deg. C., to\r\nallow contaminating bacteria to develop. The plates were next placed in\r\na glass jar together with a culture of _Bacillus subtilis_, one square\r\ncentimeter of culture surface of the latter organism being provided for\r\neach 15 cc. capacity of the jar. The jar was sealed and placed at 37 deg. C.\r\nfor three days, at the end of which time excellent surface colonies of\r\nBang's bacillus were obtained. By the application of this method Nowak\r\nhas succeeded in isolating the bacillus from the blood and intestinal\r\ncontents of a number of fetuses, and from uterine discharge, when other\r\nmethods failed. He has also observed that one could gradually decrease\r\nthe amount of culture surface of _B. subtilis_ employed in succeeding\r\ncultures and eventually get the bacillus of Bang to grow in the presence\r\nof atmospheric air, altho the cultures were relatively poor ones. Nowak\r\nalso confirmed Bang by obtaining cultures in an atmosphere of nearly\r\npure oxygen, as well as in ordinary air under a pressure of three\r\natmospheres. His cultures were evidently vigorous for some of them were\r\nsuccessfully transplanted after two years. Nowak used ordinary agar as a\r\nmedium with considerable success, and found glucose agar to be almost as\r\nfavorable to the growth of the bacillus. For the detection of the germ\r\nin pathological material, however, these media proved to be inferior to\r\nthe serum-agar mixture in several cases. Cultures were obtained in broth\r\nand in milk without coagulation, contrary to the statement of Preisz. No\r\ngas was produced in sugar broth. Nowak inoculated a number of pregnant\r\nlaboratory animals, and produced abortion with great regularity in\r\nguinea pigs and rabbits by subcutaneous, intravenous and intraperitoneal\r\ninjection. He did not succeed in producing abortion by intravaginal\r\napplication nor by feeding. No tests were made upon larger animals much\r\nto his regret, as in his opinion the experiments of Bang upon cows still\r\nleft something to be desired in the way of experimental evidence.\r\n\r\nMcFadyean and Stockman (1909) have investigated the contagious abortion\r\nof cattle in Great Britain, and have found it to be identical with that\r\nstudied by Bang in Denmark. They were able to produce the disease in\r\ncows by intravenous injection of natural virus and of active pure\r\ncultures, without a failure in eight experiments. By intravaginal\r\napplication they caused the disease twice with cultures and three times\r\nwith natural virus, but also failed to obtain any result in three trials\r\nwith the natural virus. Subcutaneous inoculation was successful three\r\ntimes in five trials. By feeding they produced the disease three times\r\nin four trials. These authors consider ingestion to be an important mode\r\nof contracting contagious abortion in nature.\r\n\r\nZwick (1910) has made a preliminary report of the bacteriological\r\ninvestigation of contagious abortion at the German Imperial Health\r\nOffice. By a comparative study of cultures, the unity of the disease in\r\nDenmark, Germany, England, and Holland has been established. Certain\r\nindividual differences were detected in the various culture strains\r\nexamined, and it was found that the bacillus could be readily cultivated\r\nupon various ordinary laboratory media, and that it could also adapt\r\nitself to an aerobic existence, thus confirming the work of Nowak. In\r\none instance the bacillus grew aerobically immediately upon isolation\r\nfrom the animal body. Abortion was induced in sheep, goats, and rabbits\r\nby intravenous injection, intravaginal application, and also by feeding.\r\nWork upon the use of abortin (analogous to tuberculin) for diagnosis,\r\nand upon the agglutination and complement fixation tests, was in\r\nprogress at the time the report was made.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTERIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS AT THIS STATION\r\n\r\nIn the United States contagious abortion is widespread, and has been\r\nrecognized for a number of years by practical husbandmen as an important\r\neconomic factor in animal industry. Epidemiological studies have\r\nrecently been reported from Arizona and Connecticut. At the Illinois\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station the beef cattle herd has suffered\r\nconsiderable loss from abortion for several years past, and the presence\r\nof contagious abortion had been recognized by Professor Mumford, altho\r\nthis diagnosis was disputed by other authorities. In order to settle the\r\nquestion it seemed best to undertake a bacteriological study of the\r\ndisease. This seemed the more desirable because, so far as we have\r\nascertained, there was no known microorganism generally recognized and\r\naccepted as the cause of the disease in this country, the bacillus\r\ndescribed by Bang having been found only in Europe and his work having\r\nfailed to be confirmed by American investigators.\r\n\r\nAltogether eighteen parturient cows have been examined\r\nbacteriologically. Ten of these calved at term and the births appeared\r\nto be normal. The abortion bacillus was not found in any of these. Eight\r\nwere cases of premature delivery, and of these, six appeared clinically\r\nto be cases of contagious abortion. Placental tissue from two of these\r\ncases was examined by the Nowak plate method and a bacillus isolated,\r\napparently identical with that isolated by Bang in Denmark and by Nowak\r\nin Austria.\r\n\r\nThe organism is a very small short rod, usually oval in shape, from 0.8 mu\r\nto 2.0 mu long by 0.7 mu wide, practically always single, rarely in short\r\nthreads of two to four cells. It is not motile, and does not form\r\nspores. It stains with moderate rapidity with the ordinary anilin dyes,\r\nand is decolorized by Gram's method. The colonies on serum-agar are\r\nraised, with smooth circular borders, appearing almost like drops of\r\ndew. They are transparent and very clear, with a bluish gray color by\r\ntransmitted light. Under the microscope a few coarse granules may be\r\nseen near the center of the colony but the greater part of it appears\r\nvery homogenous and almost water-clear. The appearance of the colony is\r\nreally a very characteristic feature of the organism and enables one to\r\ndistinguish readily the colony of the abortion bacillus from other\r\ncolonies on the serum-agar plates.\r\n\r\nThe behavior toward oxygen is another character upon which considerable\r\nreliance may be placed in the identification of strains recently\r\nisolated from the animal body. This is tested by transplanting the\r\ncolonies from the serum-agar plates to two series of agar streak\r\nsub-cultures, of which one series is incubated in the atmospheric air\r\nand the other in the closed jar together with cultures of _B. subtilis_.\r\nUnless the growth under the latter condition is much better than the\r\ngrowth outside the jar, the culture may be discarded as one not\r\nbelonging to this species.\r\n\r\nA final important test in identification is that of pathogenicity. Nowak\r\ninduced abortion in pregnant guinea pigs with great regularity by\r\nsubcutaneous, intraperitoneal, and intravenous injection of pure\r\ncultures of the abortion bacillus. So far, four pregnant guinea pigs\r\nhave been inoculated subcutaneously with the pure cultures isolated by\r\nus, and the inoculation has been followed by premature evacuation of the\r\nuterus with death of the fetuses in 3-1/2 8, 6, and 7 days\r\nrespectively. In the first guinea pig the two fetuses were practically\r\nfully developed and covered with hair. In this instance the abortion\r\nbacillus was isolated only from the subcutaneous tissue of the mother\r\nat the point of inoculation, the cultures from the uterus, the placenta,\r\nand the fetuses remaining negative. In the other three cases the fetuses\r\nwere undeveloped and the condition was that of a true abortion. In these\r\ninstances the abortion bacillus was demonstrated by culture tests at the\r\npoint of inoculation in pure culture in two, in mixed culture in the\r\nother one; in the interior of the uterus in pure culture in all three;\r\nin each of the four placentae of two cases in mixed culture, as these\r\nplacentae had been passed some time before they were found, and in the\r\nthree placentae of the other case in pure culture; in the livers of all\r\nthree fetuses of the one case in pure culture, but not in the other four\r\nfetuses; in the heart blood of the mother in pure culture in one case,\r\nbut not in the other two cases. In all these tests the mother guinea pig\r\nwas killed by chloroform soon after the abortion had occurred.\r\n\r\nFrom the results of these tests we have concluded that the bacillus\r\nisolated by us from aborting cows is identical with that isolated by\r\nBang and by Nowak. Further, the investigations of Bang, Preisz, Nowak,\r\nMcFadyean and Stockman, and Zwick, seem to justify the acceptance of\r\nthis organism as the infectious agent in the contagious abortion of\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nThe principles of bacteriological nomenclature have not as yet been\r\nuniversally adopted, and most of the investigators quoted in this paper\r\nhave avoided the use of a specific name for the abortion bacillus. Bang\r\nhimself seems not to have given it a binomial designation, but he\r\nrepeatedly employed the term \"Abortusbacillus\" as a specific term.\r\nChester (1901) has named the organism \"_Bacterium abortivum_\" with the\r\nsynonym \"Bacillus of contagious abortion in cows, Bang.\" Preisz (1902)\r\nsuggested the name \"_Corynebacterium abortus endemici (s.\r\ninfectiousi)_.\" This generic name Corynebacterium appears to be\r\nincorrect, as the organism is very different from those to which this\r\nname has been previously applied. It would seem best to employ the more\r\ngeneral term Bacillus (or Bacterium) as a confessedly temporary generic\r\nname until a more definite generic nomenclature of bacteria shall have\r\nbeen developed and generally adopted. In determining the specific name\r\nit would seem that the term \"Abortusbacillus\" employed by its\r\ndiscoverer as early as 1907 should receive first consideration. We[1]\r\nhave therefore suggested the name _Bacillus_ (or _Bacterium_)\r\n_abortus_, Bang, for this organism. The term \"_abortus_,\" being in the\r\ngenitive case, may be employed with either generic term.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: MacNeal and Kerr, 1910.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRESTRICTION AND ERADICATION OF THE DISEASE\r\n\r\nReliable methods for restricting the spread of contagious abortion and\r\nfor eradicating it from a herd may be expected as the result of more\r\ncomplete and accurate knowledge of the nature of the disease and its\r\nmode of spread. Some of these methods, such as that of artificial\r\nimmunization, are being tested experimentally by the Departmental\r\nCommittee appointed by the British Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to\r\ninquire into Epizootic Abortion. Until these methods have been developed\r\nbeyond the experimental stage, the older more or less empirical methods\r\nwill have to be relied upon. Fortunately these older methods can now be\r\nsubjected to careful scrutiny in the light of modern knowledge of the\r\ndisease, and they have been studied in this way by the British Committee\r\nmentioned above. The following summary has been copied, with only slight\r\nabridgment and very few alterations, from the report of this Committee.\r\n\r\n\"The methods which have been relied upon in the past for the prevention\r\nof abortion and its eradication from a herd are:--\r\n\r\n(1) Periodical spraying of the external genital organs and hind quarters\r\nwith disinfectant solutions.\r\n\r\n(2) Isolation of animals as soon as they show the premonitory signs of\r\nabortion.\r\n\r\n(3) Internal administration of carbolic acid to animals supposed to be\r\ninfected or exposed to infection.\r\n\r\n(4) Irrigation of the genital organs of animals which have aborted with\r\nantiseptic solutions.\r\n\r\n(5) Removal and disposal of animals which have aborted.\r\n\r\n(6) The keeping of a special bull for serving animals which have\r\naborted, or, what is based on the same idea, the disinfection of the\r\nexternal genital organs of the bull with antiseptic solutions after he\r\nhas served such a cow.\r\n\r\n(7) Destruction of the abortion membranes, and disinfection of the parts\r\nof the buildings, litter, etc., with which the infective material has\r\ncome in contact.\r\n\r\n(8) The keeping of a goat, especially a male goat, in a byre with the\r\ncows.\"\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said of the above measures that either singly or\r\ncollectively they have brought about any material improvement in the\r\ngeneral condition of our herds in relation to abortion. According to\r\nreports, decided improvements have been effected in individual herds by\r\nthe adoption of isolation and disinfection, while in others very little\r\nhas been accomplished. Some of the above methods are founded on nothing\r\nmore than ignorant empiricism, while others are based upon pathological\r\nand physiological considerations which are only partially correct in\r\ntheir applications. Since most of them have obtained a certain amount of\r\nhold, at least on the minds of stockowners, it may be useful to discuss\r\neach measure separately in the light of our recent investigations.\r\n\r\n_Spraying of the External Genital Organs._--This is a procedure which\r\nprobably has little or no value. (_Abridged._)\r\n\r\n_Isolation of Animals as soon as they show Signs of Abortion._--The\r\nnecessity for this measure is obvious, and its importance cannot be too\r\nmuch insisted on. An infected animal only becomes infective to others\r\nimmediately before the act of abortion, and may remain so for some weeks\r\nafterwards. However, only a proportion of the affected animals show\r\npremonitory signs, and quite a number may abort amongst their companions\r\nwithout warning. Under such conditions, then, measures of immediate\r\nisolation lose much of their undoubted theoretical value, owing to the\r\ndifficulty in the way of carrying them out in practice. There is not\r\nlikely to be any serious difficulty in diagnosing the bacterial disease\r\nafter an act of abortion, even in an isolated case, if the membranes are\r\navailable in a reasonably fresh state. (_Abridged._)\r\n\r\nIsolation of the affected animals, however, must be complete before and\r\nafter the act to be of any real value. Having regard to what appears to\r\nbe the most common form of infection, viz., by ingestion, we do not\r\nthink that anything material is to be gained by merely putting all the\r\ncows about to abort and those which have aborted at the lower end of a\r\nbyre, so that the infective discharges may not come in contact with the\r\nexternal genital organs of their fellows, unless we assume that\r\ninfection frequently takes place by an animal licking virulent material\r\nfrom a part of its body where it has been deposited by flicks of the\r\ntail which has been contaminated by lying in the gutter behind the\r\nstalls.\r\n\r\n_Internal Administration of Carbolic Acid._--The uselessness of carbolic\r\nacid and other antiseptics as curative agents has already been referred\r\nto. As a preventive agent by internal administration we believe carbolic\r\nacid to be equally useless. Even if it were possible to administer very\r\nlarge doses of this poisonous substance, one could not expect to be able\r\nto give enough to destroy the bacilli which have been swallowed and\r\nmixed with the contents of the enormous stomachs and intestines, and it\r\nwould be equally hopeless to expect to destroy in this way the bacilli\r\nwhich have already reached the womb. This alleged measure of prevention\r\nmust be regarded as an absurdity which has gained a certain amount of\r\nsupport owing to observations carelessly collated and carelessly\r\ninterpreted.\r\n\r\n_Irrigation of the Genital Passages after Abortion._--With the act of\r\nabortion the greater part of the uterine exudate is immediately ejected.\r\nThat some of it remains behind for a short period is certain, since we\r\nwere able to demonstrate abortion bacilli in material obtained from the\r\nvagina of a heifer three days after she had aborted. On the other hand,\r\nno abortion bacilli could be found in the uterus of another heifer a\r\nmonth after she had aborted. It seems probable that, as a rule, the\r\ngenital organs cleanse themselves by natural means a comparatively short\r\ntime after abortion has taken place. Almost immediately after abortion\r\nand expulsion of the membranes the uterus contracts, and its internal\r\nsurfaces come into apposition. Its condition is such that it would not\r\nbe possible to force fluid into it with a pump from the vagina. Apart\r\nthen, from the probability that disinfection of the uterus by\r\nantiseptics is not necessary to rid the organ of abortion bacilli, we\r\nare of opinion that it is futile to attempt it by irrigation methods. So\r\nlong as a discharge continues to come from the genital passages, we\r\nthink that for hygienic and therapeutic reasons they ought to be\r\ncleansed once or twice by the intravaginal injection of tepid antiseptic\r\nsolutions, such as a 2 per cent solution of carbolic acid or a 1 in\r\n3,000 solution of corrosive sublimate, but not on the ground that the\r\ninjections will disinfect the uterus. We are of opinion that it will\r\nseldom be necessary to continue the injections for more than a month,\r\nand that after three months there should be small risk in putting the\r\ncow to the bull, provided she is afterwards protected from fresh\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\n_Removal and disposal of Animals which have aborted._--It is quite a\r\nprevalent custom to feed for the butcher cows which have aborted. It is\r\nalso customary to sell such cows alive in the open market. The second\r\ncustom we consider likely to introduce disease to other establishments,\r\nunless the animals have ceased to discharge; they should, we think, be\r\nkept for at least three months after abortion before being sent for\r\nsale.\r\n\r\nThe first custom is less objectionable than the second, but we think\r\nthat a breeder will be more likely to get rid of abortion from his herds\r\nby keeping such animals than by disposing of them and bringing in new\r\nones before his entire herd is free from the disease. There can be no\r\ndoubt that in most cases an attack of the disease greatly increases an\r\nanimal's resistance to future attacks, and that in a large proportion of\r\nthe affected, probably in the majority, this resistance is sufficient to\r\nfortify them against infection during their next pregnancy. It is beyond\r\ndoubt that a considerable proportion may abort twice in succession, but\r\nit is not improbable that inoculation methods may now be successfully\r\nemployed to exalt their resistance. In the midst of infection there is\r\nno better guarantee against the disease than the possession of an immune\r\nstock, and for this reason we consider that on infected premises the\r\nanimals which have already aborted are to be looked upon as valuable\r\nassets for purposes of eradication, much more valuable than the new and\r\nsusceptible animals brought in. We find, however, that a small\r\nproportion of cows will not hold to the bull for an indefinite period\r\nafter abortion, and it may be found better to fatten off such animals,\r\nunless they are of high value.\r\n\r\n_The Keeping of a Special Bull for Cows which have aborted._--We have\r\nalready stated that we do not consider the bull a factor of the first\r\nimportance in the dissemination of abortion but that infection by means\r\nof a contaminated bull must be looked upon as a distinct possibility. We\r\nthink, therefore, that there is something to be said in favor of keeping\r\na bull for the service of cows which have aborted, and, when that is not\r\npossible, of disinfecting the external genital organs of the bull after\r\nhe has served such cows. Of course, if the cows can be immunized the\r\nsame bull might be used for all. We do not think that cows from a clean\r\nestablishment should be sent even to a clean bull on infected premises,\r\nand it is also inadvisable that cows from infected premises should be\r\nsent to a bull on a clean establishment.\r\n\r\n_Destruction of Virulent Material and disinfection of everything\r\ncontaminated by it._--The immediate disinfection of the virulent\r\nmaterials and contaminated objects is of great importance, more\r\nespecially as it appears that the natural virus may remain active for a\r\nlong time outside the body. The soiled litter, dung, exudate, membranes,\r\nand fetus should all be removed at once, preferably after they have been\r\ntreated with caustic lime. After removal they should be soaked in\r\nparaffin and burned, or buried in a deep pit, preferably the former. On\r\nno account should the fetus and membranes be fed to pigs or dogs. When a\r\nfetus is aborted alive, as sometimes happens, it seldom survives long,\r\nand it is advisable to kill and destroy it, since it may excrete\r\nabundance of virulent material from its intestines if allowed to live.\r\nIf, however, it be decided not to kill it, it should immediately be\r\nisolated. The walls of the stall and the floor should be washed or\r\nstrewn thickly with caustic lime, or drenched freely with boiling water.\r\nThe temperature necessary to kill the bacillus is not great, and this\r\nsimple method of disinfection should prove efficacious. Lastly, the\r\nboots, clothing, and hands of attendants should be disinfected by making\r\nuse of any reliable disinfectant, such as 3 or 4 per cent solution of\r\ncarbolic acid.\r\n\r\n_The keeping of a Goat amongst the Cows._--This, we believe can only\r\nhave had its origin in ignorant superstition, but we feel bound to\r\nmention it, as the question of its efficacy has quite frequently been\r\nseriously put to us. We would point out that goats themselves can be\r\ninfected with cattle abortion, and that both male and female goats were\r\non our premises during the greater part of the time occupied with the\r\ncattle experiments, and their presence did not prevent animals from\r\naborting.\r\n\r\n_Preventive Inoculation._--This is still in the experimental stage and\r\ndefinite results are hoped for. (_Abridged._)\r\n\r\nThe Committee refrained from making any recommendations in regard to\r\nmeasures to be taken by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries for the\r\nprevention of the disease.\r\n\r\nExperience in connection with the beef cattle herd at the Illinois\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station with the methods of isolation, careful\r\ndisposal of infected material, cleaning and disinfection of infected\r\nstalls, antiseptic irrigation of the genital passages of cows which had\r\naborted, and antiseptic irrigation of the bull before and after service,\r\ntogether with the use of a special bull for heifers and clean cows, has\r\nbeen very satisfactory. These measures were applied under the direction\r\nof Professor H. W. Mumford and Mr. H. O. Allison. During the year\r\nprevious to the inauguration of these measures a large percentage of the\r\ncalves were lost by abortion. A decided improvement in respect to the\r\nnumber of calves saved was coincident with the use of the procedures\r\nmentioned above. They were applied to each case of abortion as it\r\noccurred, until in the course of two years abortions have become very\r\ninfrequent and the herd is now considered free from the disease. It\r\nshould be noted, however, that those cows which had aborted were not\r\nnecessarily disposed of, but after local irrigation treatment until the\r\ndischarge had ceased, they were bred again. Some of the improvement in\r\nthe herd has, therefore, doubtless been due merely to the retention of\r\nrelatively immune cows.\r\n\r\nAltho the experience here has been rather fortunate and the results\r\nobtained seem to bear some relation to the employment of the measures\r\ndeemed worthy by the British Committee, we hesitate to state that there\r\nwas any necessary relation between them, because cattle men have\r\nobserved somewhat similar improvement in herds without the use of any\r\ntreatment at all. In other words, there appears to be a tendency for the\r\ndisease sometimes to die out in a herd or to become quiescent for a year\r\nor two. On the other hand, the recommendations of the British Committee\r\nsupported as they seem to be by our local experience, certainly warrant\r\nthe recommendation of these measures for use in combating contagious\r\nabortion. In any event good results cannot be expected without\r\nintelligent, careful, and painstaking work, and it may be that some of\r\nthe failures in applying these measures have resulted from lack of\r\nefficiency in applying them rather than from insufficiency of the\r\nmeasures themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n1. =Bang.= Die Aetiologie des seuchenhaften (\"infectioesen\") Verwertens.\r\nZtschr. f.
