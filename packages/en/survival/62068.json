Not only\r\ndoes it offer a new means of efficiency in military reconnaissance,\r\nrapid delivery of mail, fire patrol of forests, and the constantly\r\nincreasing number of commercial and scientific pursuits to which it is\r\nbeing adapted; but it has also opened a new world to the geographer, the\r\nphysiographer, and the geologist.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIRPLANE PHOTOGRAPHY: ITS DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION\r\n\r\nVery early in the war the airplane was recognized as a useful, in fact a\r\nnecessary, means of observing enemy positions and movements. But the\r\nspeed of the airplane was found to preclude the taking of more than the\r\nmost hurried of notes during a flight, and notes written from memory are\r\nnot the most satisfactory. Photography was found to obviate this\r\ndifficulty. The ability of the camera to make instantaneous exposures\r\nand fix a clear image on a photographic plate enabled the observer to\r\nobtain a record not only of the scenes that he had viewed but also of\r\nmany that he might have missed while engaged in the necessary business\r\nof watching the sky for the enemy--a record that for detail and accuracy\r\ncould not be approached by the most elaborate notes or the most graphic\r\ndescription. Immediately inventive genius was set at work to adjust the\r\nmechanism of the camera to the demands of air photography and to prepare\r\nthe rapidly working films and highly sensitized paper necessary for the\r\nbest results.\r\n\r\nSo satisfactory were the results and so great are the possibilities of\r\nfurther adaptation that there is an unfortunate tendency on the part of\r\ncertain enthusiasts to make exaggerated claims that may react to retard\r\nprogress. This is particularly true in the use of the air photograph in\r\nmapping. There are limitations to this use of air photography. It cannot\r\nbe reasonably expected to do away entirely with the ground work of the\r\nsurveyor. Rather, the camera is to be regarded as one of the instruments\r\nof the surveyor. Observation from the air can never take the place of\r\nclose examination of the ground, but it can be of great use in the\r\nlocation and study of land forms and geologic relations. Air photography\r\nis only an added means of obtaining information, although it promises to\r\nbecome a very important means.\r\n\r\nObservations from the air described in numerous reports and articles in\r\ngeographic magazines during the war and since its close indicate that\r\nair craft, especially in connection with air photography, can be of\r\ngreat use in studying the physical features of the face of the earth. In\r\norder to make a practical test of the use of the airplane in the study\r\nof geography the writer spent about nine months during the year 1920\r\nmaking flights, taking pictures from air craft, and gathering\r\ninformation from various sources. This book embodies the chief results.\r\n\r\nThe material presented here is by way of illustrating the possibility of\r\nusing the airplane and airplane photography as a means of securing\r\ninformation that should become increasingly useful in the study of\r\ngeography, and of showing geographic and geologic features better than\r\nin any other way. The views have been chosen to illustrate the three\r\nuses of air photographs with which this book deals--the presentation of\r\nnew views of subjects of popular interest and the practical value of\r\nsuch views; the study of land forms from a new and advantageous point\r\nof view; and the use of the air photograph as an aid in mapping.\r\n\r\nIn presenting these illustrations there is no intention that the list of\r\ntypes should be considered in any sense complete. Physiographic\r\nobservation from the air is a relatively new undertaking, and results\r\nare limited and imperfect. As improvements in mechanism and technique\r\nare made, observations will be extended and better photographs and a\r\ngreater variety of them will be secured. Such as are presented here,\r\nhowever, serve to demonstrate that the air photograph will come to be\r\nrecognized as a valuable source of information for the student of\r\ngeography and geology.\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\nThe results here presented were secured by the co-operation of the Air\r\nServices of the United States Army and Navy. Hydroplanes were placed at\r\nmy disposal on several occasions, and a number of flights were made over\r\nwater bodies, particularly over the Potomac River, Chesapeake Bay, and\r\nNew York Harbor. But the information was gathered chiefly through the\r\nArmy Air Service. Many flights were made in army planes, some for\r\ngeneral observation, others for photographing specific objects. Also the\r\narmy photographers, particularly those at Langley Field, near Newport\r\nNews, Va., made several photographic trips at my request, and a large\r\nnumber of prints were furnished from negatives stored at this and other\r\nflying fields.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I wish to express appreciation for the many\r\ncourtesies extended by Major General C. T. Menoher, U. S. A., Chief of\r\nAir Service at the time the work was done, and by Major J.W. Simons,\r\nJr., A.S., Acting Administrative Executive, Air Service. These officers\r\nplaced at my disposal every facility of the service that I could use. It\r\nwould be a pleasure, if space allowed, to mention the names of the\r\nnumerous pilots and other officers to whom I am directly indebted for\r\nthe safe completion of some of the most thrilling adventures of my life.\r\nI must, however, mention the officer to whom I am perhaps more indebted\r\nthan to any other. My introduction to this study was through Major J.W.\r\nBagley of the United States Army Engineering Corps, who has done much\r\ntoward making the camera a valuable instrument in mapping.[1] Through\r\nhis active interest I became acquainted with the officials of the Army\r\nAir Service, who gave the necessary authorization for flights and for\r\nsecuring most of the photographs used to illustrate this book. During\r\nthe time spent at this work I retained my position as geologist of the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey. Hence the work is one of co-operation\r\nchiefly between the United States Army Air Service and the United States\r\nGeological Survey, and to a lesser degree with the United States Navy\r\nAir Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE VIEWPOINT\r\n\r\n(FIGS. 1 TO 4)\r\n\r\n\r\nOBLIQUE AND VERTICAL AIRPLANE PHOTOGRAPHS\r\n\r\nAir photographs are, in general, of two sorts, depending upon whether\r\nthe photograph was taken with the camera pointing vertically or\r\nobliquely downward. In either case the air photographer is free from the\r\nlimitations that hamper the ground photographer in choosing a point of\r\nview. For he can ascend to any desired height and not only select an\r\nadvantageous position from which to photograph the feature which he\r\nwishes to emphasize but also, at the same time, avoid obstacles which\r\nmight obstruct his view from the ground. Vertical photographs are\r\npreferable where the accurate location of objects is desired. When\r\nproperly taken they serve many of the purposes of maps and are, in many\r\nways, even more useful than maps. They furnish the untrained mind with\r\nmuch of the information that the trained mind reads from a topographic\r\nmap and, in addition, supply details and relations that a map cannot\r\ndepict. Exact accuracy, however, cannot be claimed for them until they\r\nhave been corrected for distortion and adjusted to some system of\r\ncontrols.\r\n\r\nWhere the photograph is to be used as a means of securing a more\r\nadvantageous view of a subject than can be had from the ground rather\r\nthan as a map on which distances are to be scaled off, the oblique\r\nphotograph is probably the more desirable, since it is as easily\r\nintelligible as a photograph taken laterally. The advantage of such\r\nphotographs is obvious. To the architect, the landscape gardener, the\r\ncity planner is given the opportunity to study their projects free from\r\nall obstructions yet in such perspective that their relations to their\r\nsurroundings are brought out as would be possible by no other means.\r\nViews like that of West Point (Fig. 3) are occasionally to be had from\r\nsome hilltop, but the limited choice of position on the ground contrasts\r\nsharply with the unlimited choice in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nELEMENTS TO BE RECORDED\r\n\r\nAir photography is by no means simple. Much still remains to be done by\r\nway of adapting the camera to its peculiar demands. Its present degree\r\nof perfection, of course, is largely due to the impetus given its\r\ndevelopment during the war because of its great importance in military\r\nreconnaissance. The adaptation of the camera to operation from the\r\nairplane might be described with profit but will be passed with slight\r\nmention because it is the results of air photography rather than the\r\nmechanism that are to be considered here. Technically, a photograph of\r\nthe earth’s surface may not be a map, but, given certain means of\r\ninterpretation, it can be made to serve as such. In using air\r\nphotographs, particularly the vertical ones, it is desirable to know the\r\nscale, which is dependent upon the altitude at which the exposure is\r\nmade; the angle of the lens; and the variation from the vertical, in\r\norder to make corrections for distortion. Therefore, it is desirable\r\nthat each photograph show the altitude, date, time of day, and position\r\nof the lens at which the exposure was made. Cameras have been\r\nconstructed that automatically record these data on each negative. This\r\ninformation is illustrated in Figure 2. The circular symbol at the left\r\nin the white strip at the top of the photograph represents a circular\r\nlevel, or inclinometer. The small round dot close to the center of the\r\ninclinometer indicates that, at the time the exposure was made, the axis\r\nof the lens was very nearly vertical. The symbol in the center of the\r\nwhite strip indicates an altitude of about 9,800 feet, and that at the\r\nright, that the exposure was made 7 seconds after 11 A.M. The other\r\nsymbols record that this photograph was No. 13 of a series made at\r\nRochester, N. Y., October 23, 1920, with an Eastman mapping camera known\r\nas K-2. The symbol 8-P is non-essential and records that this negative\r\nis No. 8 of panchromatic film.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2--Symbols of automatic register in the Eastman\r\nmapping camera, photographed with the body of the picture showing roads,\r\nstreams, orchards, cultivated fields, etc. For explanation of the\r\nsymbols, see the text.]\r\n\r\nThe information given by the symbols is corroborated by the picture.\r\nOrchard and shade trees appear as circular dots in place of the\r\nelongated images characteristic of pictures taken obliquely downward,\r\nand the short, squat shadows denote exposure near midday. Shocks of corn\r\nstanding in the fields show that the season is autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO READ AIRPLANE PHOTOGRAPHS\r\n\r\nNot all the features, however, are so easily recognizable. Oblique\r\nphotographs are often more readily interpreted than ordinary\r\nphotographs, since they combine with the usual view the essentials of a\r\nplan; but in vertical photographs very few objects present an appearance\r\nthat is natural in the light of our experience as lateral observers. The\r\nuninitiated, on attempting systematically to identify the features of a\r\nvertical photograph, find a very large number that are foreign in\r\nappearance. A necessary preliminary is an acquaintance with the ground\r\nphotographed or with similar regions and features. Without such a key\r\nthe air photograph is not always self-interpretative and is often\r\nunintelligible. Military observers are carefully trained to recognize\r\nfeatures of military significance. It is not to be expected, however,\r\nthat they should be trained in the observation of land forms except such\r\nas are of military importance. Consequently, whereas a great variety of\r\nphotographs is now easily obtainable at many flying fields, the\r\ninformation that a scientist would desire concerning them is not so\r\neasily available. Most of the photographs used in this paper were taken\r\nby men who were not trained in observing land forms. Many were taken\r\nsimply as a requirement in practice flights and meant so little to the\r\nobserver that no record was made concerning them. For several not even\r\nthe location was recorded.\r\n\r\nIt is of primary importance that the picture be held in the right\r\nposition. Not only must the observer imagine himself looking directly\r\ndown on the scene but he must hold the photograph in the position in\r\nwhich experience has shown that the image appears the most natural.\r\nOtherwise a depression will appear as an elevation and an elevation as a\r\nhollow. It is a well-known fact that in telescopic photographs of the\r\nmoon the craters appear like hollows when the print is held in one\r\nposition and like elevations when the position is reversed. Experience\r\nshows that if the print is held _so that the shadows fall toward the\r\nobserver_ the objects appear natural. The reason is that the observer\r\nsees only those shadows that are caused by light falling towards him.\r\nConsequently, the only interpretation that the brain can give to shadows\r\non a photograph is that they are cast by an elevation between the eye\r\nand the light. In a picture, therefore, in which shadows fall away from\r\nthe eye instead of towards it valleys are seen as hills and hills as\r\nvalleys. In the northern hemisphere this prescribed orientation\r\nconflicts with the convention of placing the north side of a map at the\r\ntop of the page and also with the modern shaded map on which the light\r\nis represented as coming from the upper left, or northwest, corner of\r\nthe map.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAILURE OF AIR PHOTOGRAPHS TO SHOW RELIEF, AND MEASURES TO REMEDY THIS\r\nDEFECT\r\n\r\nIn photographs taken from the ground the lights and shadows are such\r\nthat a high degree of naturalness is possible. But objects seen from\r\ndirectly above, and even those viewed obliquely, though to a lesser\r\ndegree, are illuminated so uniformly that photographs of them are apt to\r\nappear flat. To some extent this has been overcome by the use of\r\nextra-sensitive emulsions, special ray filters, and printing papers\r\nadapted for accentuating contrast. Many of the photographs used in this\r\nbook did not allow satisfactory reproduction till the contrast of the\r\nnegatives was greatly increased by the arts of the photographic\r\nlaboratory. But, even at its best, no photograph taken vertically\r\naffords an adequate idea of the height of hills or the depth of hollows.\r\nOnly shadows that are particularly well defined can be distinguished as\r\nshadows, while small elevations and depressions affect the negative no\r\ndifferently than a difference in marking or color. In military defenses,\r\nif the mere surface of the camouflage is sufficiently realistic, the\r\nordinary camera is even more easily deceived than the human eye. It is a\r\nwell-known fact that man and other animals of the higher order see\r\nobjects in relief, within a certain range of vision, because the eyes\r\nconvey to their respective retinas slightly different images of the same\r\nobject which the brain combines into a relief image. The stereoscopic\r\ncamera has long been used for the same purpose. Its principle, with\r\ncertain adaptations that need not be discussed here, has been to some\r\nextent employed in airplane pictures, with such excellent results that\r\nit is claimed by some that by further development actual contouring will\r\nbe possible by this means. It is reported that in military\r\nreconnaissance stereoscopic pictures render ordinary camouflage useless\r\nand that bridges, observation towers, gun emplacements, etc., are shown\r\nin relief and, therefore, easily detected.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFAMILIAR SCENES FROM A NEW ANGLE\r\n\r\n(FIGS. 1, 3, AND 4)\r\n\r\n\r\nPictures of well-known buildings are of wide appeal. In so far as they\r\ncreate an interest in the activities for which the buildings stand they\r\nare distinctly educative. Such widely known buildings as the National\r\nCapitol and the Library of Congress are used repeatedly for\r\nillustration. They are as welcome as the sight of a familiar face. Any\r\nunusual circumstance connected with them is seized upon as an excuse for\r\nrepublishing pictures of them. Views of them from a new angle are always\r\nin demand. Not only do air photographs offer a welcome novelty, but they\r\nhave the added advantage of lifting the subject out of the clutter of\r\nsurrounding buildings and making it really the central figure of the\r\npicture. It would be difficult to get a more impressive view of the\r\nNational Capitol than that of Figure 1 or a more attractive glimpse of\r\nthe Naval Academy at Annapolis than that of Figure 4. The objects of\r\nchief interest occupy the center of view without distracting\r\nobstructions. In the former, the imposing structure of the Capitol\r\nbuilding appears in a pleasing setting of minor details. The proximity\r\nof the Senate Office Building and the Library of Congress is at once\r\napparent, and the radiating systems of the avenues of approach.\r\nStrangers may have wondered as to the nature of the environs of the\r\nCapitol. The tree-lined streets and the apartment houses seen in the\r\npicture answer the question. In the view of the Naval Academy the\r\nbuildings occupy the center of the scene, with the beautiful dome of the\r\nmemorial to John Paul Jones, the first great American naval fighter,\r\nprominently in view. Spa Creek in the foreground, a part of the capital\r\ncity of Maryland at the left, and the Severn River, with its low wooded\r\nbanks, stretching away\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3--West Point, N. Y., and the Hudson River. An air\r\nview of the United States Military Academy and the gorge of the Hudson.\r\nThe picture shows the commanding view of the river to be had from the\r\npoint of land 180 feet above the river on which the Military Academy is\r\nlocated and shows the wisdom of the choice of this spot as one of the\r\nchain of redoubts by which the river was fortified during the\r\nRevolution.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4--The Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md. Oblique view\r\nfrom an airplane from a position over Eastport in a general\r\nnorthwesterly direction. The water in the foreground is Spa Creek. The\r\nSevern River, spanned by the county bridge and the Baltimore and\r\nAnnapolis Railroad bridge, stretches away to the left. The buildings in\r\nthe middle of the picture are those of the Naval Academy. The domed\r\nmausoleum built in honor of John Paul Jones, which serves as his final\r\nresting place, appears at the left. Still farther to the left lies\r\nMaryland’s capital city. Of interest is a comparison of the low-lying\r\nand stream-cut banks of the drowned valley now occupied by the Severn\r\nRiver with the mountains through which the Hudson River has cut its\r\ngorge at West Point (see Fig. 3).]\r\n\r\nin the distance, spanned by the county bridge and the Baltimore and\r\nAnnapolis Railroad bridge, form an interesting setting and show, without\r\ndetracting from the importance of the academy itself, its advantageous\r\nlocation with regard to the city and the water approaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE, LANDSCAPE GARDENING, AND ENGINEERING\r\n\r\n(FIGS. 5 TO 14)\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly a few photographs are necessary to show how valuable to the\r\narchitect, the construction engineer, the city planner, or the landscape\r\ngardener the air photograph, both vertical and oblique, is destined to\r\nbecome. Pictorial records of progress in the construction of buildings,\r\nbridges, ships, canals, reservoirs, etc., that partake also of the\r\nnature of ground plans, as do air photographs, furnish an admirable\r\nmeans of study and comparison. No photograph of the great shipyards at\r\nNewport News taken from the ground would show the relation of the shops\r\nand drydocks to the deep-water approaches as does Figure 7. Figure 8\r\ngives an unusually comprehensive idea of the location, magnitude, and\r\nconstruction of Hell Gate Bridge; and Figure 10, Rockaway Beach, now a\r\ndensely populated town where a few years ago was a barren strip of sand,\r\nsuggests that photographic records of construction in rapidly growing\r\ncommunities where changes are being made in streets, railroads, and\r\nbuildings, will come to be a part of the equipment of the city engineer\r\nand architect.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE AND LANDSCAPE GARDENING\r\n\r\nEqually useful will the air photograph become to the landscape gardener\r\nand architect. Heretofore, in order to get a comprehensive conception of\r\nhis task and a definite picture of its completion, the landscape\r\ngardener has had to depend upon the use of maps and such views as could\r\nbe made by the sketch artist or the ordinary lateral photograph. In the\r\nfuture, from vertical and oblique photographs of the area to be\r\ndeveloped, he will have the means of studying its features in their\r\ncorrect proportions and relationship. By means of similar photographs of\r\ncompleted projects he can choose and combine until he has developed the\r\nplans best suited to his purpose. He can bring to his aid first-hand\r\nstudies of gardens and grounds the world over whose beauties have made\r\nthem famous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5--Monument Avenue, Richmond, Va., and the statue of\r\nRobert E. Lee. An oblique photograph illustrating the use of aerial\r\nphotography in landscape gardening and street planning.]\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINEERING PROJECTS COVERING LARGE AREAS\r\n\r\nWhere the project covers large areas, the “mosaic,” or group of matched\r\nphotographs, can be used in the study of problems of construction or\r\nimprovement. Figure 13, a mosaic of the Anacostia flats, the site of\r\nimprovements under way in the District\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6--The United States Naval Observatory and grounds,\r\nWashington, D.C., as seen from an airplane at a height of a few hundred\r\nfeet above the ground, showing an unusually attractive arrangement of\r\nshrubbery and trees.]\r\n\r\nof Columbia, shows the Anacostia marshes as they appeared in the autumn\r\nof 1920, after the changes effected since 1915, as can be seen by\r\ncomparison with Figure 14, the topographic map of the same area. To the\r\nright is the terraced slope rising to a height of about 150 feet above\r\nthe river--an elevation so low that the air photograph does not properly\r\nreproduce it. Near the foot of the principal terrace lie the tracks of\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad, on which can be seen Benning, Deanewood, and\r\nKenilworth. Between the railroad and the Anacostia River are the Benning\r\nrace track and the swampy lowland and tidal marshes of the Anacostia\r\nflats. The river and the marshland on either side of it from the\r\nPennsylvania Avenue Bridge to Benning Road have been modified by\r\ndredging, but north of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7--Shipyards at Newport News, Va., showing docks and\r\ndeep-water approaches, steamships, and drydocks, in one of which is a\r\nvessel for repairs.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8--The New York Connecting Railroad Bridge, which\r\naffords an all-rail passenger and freight route between Boston and\r\nWashington. The bridge, which was completed in 1917, starts on the\r\nmainland in the Port Morris section of southern Bronx Borough, New York\r\nCity, seen in the background, then crosses Bronx Kill, Randalls Island,\r\nLittle Hell Gate, Wards Island, and Hell Gate to reach the Long Island\r\nshore, seen in the extreme lower right corner, at Long Island City,\r\nQueens Borough. The tracks continue towards Washington by way of tunnels\r\nunder the East River and the Hudson.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9--A part of Washington, D.C., showing the White\r\nHouse, Treasury, State-War-Navy, and other public buildings in the\r\nforeground; the Ellipse, Washington Monument, and new War and Navy\r\noffices in the middle ground; and the Tidal Basin, Potomac Park, and the\r\nPotomac River in the distance. By no other means could so informative a\r\nglimpse be given of a spot of such wide interest. Every feature in the\r\npicture is more or less familiar to a large number of Americans, but\r\ntheir familiarity is with the individual features rather than with their\r\nsituation and relation to one another as shown here.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10--Part of Rockaway Beach, Long Island, N.Y.,\r\nshowing city blocks, streets, and buildings covering the sand which a\r\nfew years ago was barren and unoccupied.

In the mosaic are\r\nshown at the left the highlands west of the marshes, wooded in some\r\nplaces but cleared and improved in others. In the northern part can be\r\nseen land wooded north of the District line but cleared south of it. So\r\ncomprehensive a view of the field of the project and of the progress to\r\ndate should be of great service to the engineers and promoters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE MOSAIC\r\n\r\n(FIGS. 13 AND 22)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its simplest form, the mosaic is made by mounting overlapping prints\r\nso that the corresponding details coincide. This type of mosaic is quite\r\nadequate for relatively small areas or where a high degree of accuracy\r\nis not required. For larger areas and greater accuracy, an accurate\r\noutline map is used as a base upon which the prints are mounted so that\r\nrecognizable features coincide with their location on the map. When the\r\nprints are properly arranged, the better print of each overlapping pair\r\nis selected, the excess paper removed, and the whole mounted and\r\nphotographed. Figure 13 is left untrimmed to illustrate the method of\r\nmatching the overlapping prints. The differences in shade are due to\r\ndifference in printing and developing the pictures which make up the\r\nmosaic. The slight offsetting of line at the junction of the prints may\r\nbe due to errors in mounting, shrinking, or stretching of the\r\nphotographic paper, tilting of the camera at the time of exposure, or\r\nother cause. Such errors and imperfections illustrate the difficulty of\r\nusing these photographs in the making of maps.\r\n\r\nA skillful manipulation of both airplane and camera is necessary to the\r\nsuccess of the mosaic. To prevent distortion and variation of scale, the\r\ncamera must be maintained at the same altitude at all times and pointed\r\ndirectly downward. This can be accomplished by flying with an even keel\r\nat a uniform altitude. Mechanical devices are also being perfected to\r\naccomplish the same result. Still greater skill is necessary when\r\nconsecutive rows of exposures are made for the purpose of placing strips\r\nof photographs side by side to cover a large area. It is difficult under\r\nthe varying conditions of wind and weather to fly so evenly and so\r\nnearly at the same level that distortions and differences in scale are\r\nnot noticeable. Strong objection to the mosaic is frequently raised\r\nbecause of inaccuracies due to difference in scale in neighboring\r\nprints. Until these defects are overcome, such a group of matched\r\nphotographs cannot take the place of an accurate map. Much, however, is\r\nbeing done to correct these defects, and, even in photographs where\r\ninaccuracies in scale are many, the value of the photograph for the\r\nportrayal of detail cannot be denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nGENERAL ASPECTS OF THE SURFACE AS SEEN FROM THE AIR\r\n\r\n(FIGS. 12 TO 18)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12--Benning, D.C., and the Anacostia River, showing,\r\nfrom right to left, cultivated lands 40 to 20 feet above sea level, an\r\nelevation too slight to be shown in a vertical photograph; a brushy\r\nslope running from 20 feet to sea level; and marshland along the stream.\r\nThe checkered pattern of the upland fields is caused by\r\ndifferent-colored crops. Shocks of corn, spaced evenly in rows,\r\nbuildings and shade trees, and light-colored roads and a race track are\r\nshown. The light-colored areas along the stream are occupied by tidal\r\nmarsh and are free from brush but covered with vegetation of annual\r\ngrowth. The figure is one of the photographs used to make the mosaic\r\nshown on Fig. 13. It should be compared with Fig. 13 and with the\r\ntopographic map, Fig. 14. Scale, 1: 11,000.]\r\n\r\nWhen a region is viewed from an altitude of several thousand feet the\r\nobserver can readily imagine himself looking down on a large map. The\r\nchief features stand out prominently, the smaller to a lesser degree.\r\nMountains, rivers, and the seashore are\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13--Vertical photograph of the land along the\r\nAnacostia River on the eastern edge of Washington, D.C., made up of\r\nseveral photographs matched together and adjusted to points located by\r\nordinary survey methods, and reduced in size to correspond with the map,\r\nFig. 14. The photographs were taken from an airplane with a so-called\r\nmapping camera at such intervals of time that the prints overlap, thus\r\nmaking it possible to adjust them to each other and to form a continuous\r\npicture of the area. The region shown is the site of improvements that\r\nare at present under way, mainly the regulation of the Anacostia River.\r\nThe channel has been widened by dredging and part of the bordering marsh\r\nareas filled in. The photograph shows that this work had progressed to\r\nthe Benning Road bridge by the autumn of 1920, when the photograph was\r\ntaken, while in 1915, when the area was surveyed for the map, it had\r\nbeen carried out only as far as the Pennsylvania Avenue bridge. Such\r\nairplane photographs furnish an incomparable tool in the handling of\r\nlarge-scale engineering projects, both in the study of the territory in\r\nits unimproved state and to follow the progress of the work after\r\noperations are under way.

The higher land, about 10 feet above\r\nsea level as determined by surveys on the ground, is shown at the right\r\nby roads and cultivated fields. It is to be noted that roads outline the\r\ndividing line between the high ground and the marsh. At the left are\r\nlower areas of wooded or brushy swampland and of grassy marsh. They\r\ncontain a number of abandoned channels: some completely silted up,\r\nothers containing small thoroughfares, and still others drained by\r\nmeandering streams which seem to have developed after the channels were\r\ndefinitely abandoned by the streams which originally occupied them.\r\n\r\nThe streams which drain the marshes have many characteristics of streams\r\nwhich drain higher lands. They have dendritic patterns, so called from\r\nresemblance to the forking branches of a tree; channels which widen\r\ndownstream; and winding or meandering courses. The island terminates in\r\na long spit composed of silt and fine sand. The banks to the left on\r\nJames River are low and marshy: those to the right on Warwick Creek,\r\nexcept for one small marsh, form low bluffs.\r\n\r\nIn order that the mosaic may be compared with the map, Fig. 16, it has\r\nbeen placed with the northerly part at the top of the page, with the\r\nresult that, until the page is reversed, the trees in the swampland\r\nappear like hollows in the earth.

Streams appear as smooth, winding\r\nribbons--glistening if the sunlight reflected from them enters the eye,\r\ndark if the bright rays are reflected away from the eye. Railroads can\r\neasily be traced and towns recognized by their form. Concrete roads and\r\nothers of light-colored material are plainly visible. Those built of\r\ndark-colored material appear less prominently. Something even of the\r\ncharacter of the forests can be ascertained--whether evenly timbered or\r\npartly of primary and partly of secondary growth; whether intact or\r\npartly burned over; whether consisting chiefly of one species of trees\r\nor of many. The cultivated fields and their relations to roads, streams,\r\nand forests are conspicuous. Towns and cities are spread out like\r\npanoramic views in which are strikingly visible the residence and\r\nmanufacturing centers, the layout of streets, the systems of parks, the\r\nposition of suburbs, and the relation of these to routes of\r\ntransportation and travel--roads, railroads, and waterways.

Ga. A part of a mosaic made at Camp\r\nBenning near-by in 1909 showing the town, river, and surrounding\r\ncountry. The scale is so small that buildings and trees appear as dots,\r\ncity blocks as small parallelograms, streets and roads as light-colored\r\nlines. The cultivated fields appear as irregularly checkered areas, and\r\nthe concentric lines of the terraced slopes have the appearance of\r\ncontour lines on a topographic map (see Fig. 18). The picture\r\nillustrates many of the features of city geography. The comparatively\r\nstraight course of the river and the heavy growth of trees and bushes\r\nalong its edges indicate a minimum of flood-plain and steep banks--an\r\ninference supported by the fact that the principal business center of\r\nthe city, shown by large, closely set roofs, is built close to the\r\nriver. Surrounding this section is the most densely populated district,\r\nwhich in the northern part of the city gives way to a district of houses\r\nset farther apart and separated by lawns set with trees. Other less\r\nextensive business centers are shown as small spots of closely grouped\r\nbuildings. A variety of suburban types is to be seen: some quite\r\ncity-like, with a business center, a densely populated residential\r\ndistrict, and a district of houses separated by grounds; others more\r\nvillage-like in their lack of a well-developed center but still more or\r\nless completely separated from the city proper; still others, sporadic\r\nscatterings of houses and grounds extending from the city for some\r\ndistance along the principal roads. The railroad center is located\r\nconveniently near the business center, and the radiating lines of road\r\nand railroad communications are in strong contrast to the rectangular\r\narrangement of the city streets. Factories, indicated by large,\r\nlight-colored roofs, are located along the railroad in the southern part\r\nof the city and along the river to the north. Those along the river are\r\noperated by power from the falls which the picture shows. The terraced\r\nslopes are characteristic of the region, the farmers here and elsewhere\r\nin the South making these terraces in their plowed fields to prevent\r\nrain water from washing away the soil.

Swamps, parts of everglades, peaks in the\r\nmidst of difficult country, precipitous canyon walls, and many volcanic\r\ncraters cannot be seen from the ground without undue effort. Photographs\r\nof bluffs, terraces, and other slopes facing bodies of water have\r\nhitherto been adequately obtainable only from the water. All of these\r\ncan be readily viewed and photographed from the airplane. Pictorial\r\nrepresentations of drainage systems were rare until photographs such as\r\nFigure 19 were taken from airplanes. The intricate drainage of marshes\r\nlike those along the Pamunkey River in Virginia pictured in Figure 20\r\nwas never accurately shown until photographed from the air.\r\n\r\nOf frequent occurrence on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the United\r\nStates are swamps and marshes inaccessible from the ground. Much of the\r\nsurface material is so soft that they cannot be easily traversed; and,\r\neven where firm enough to support a man’s weight, few of the details are\r\ndeemed of sufficient importance to warrant the trouble and expense of\r\nmapping by ordinary methods. Yet the trapper would scarcely admit that\r\nthese details are unimportant, and, to the student, they are an\r\ninteresting feature of marsh topography that has thus far received\r\nlittle attention.\r\n\r\nFigure 25 is part of the excellent New Kent, Va., sheet of the\r\ntopographic map and is probably as detailed as a map of this character\r\nshould be when made from ground surveys only. However, on comparison of\r\nthe map with a photograph of the same area (Fig. 24), there is no\r\ndifficulty in detecting errors; and it is probable that, had the\r\nphotograph been available when the map was made, the marshes would have\r\nbeen represented differently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19--Stream development in a tidal marsh, showing, at\r\nthe right, the northern end of Ludlam Beach, about 6 miles south of\r\nOcean City, N.J., and the mouth of Corsons Inlet leading to Ludlam Bay,\r\nand, at the left, the marsh just west of the inlet, with streams rising\r\nclose to the bank of the larger stream at the extreme left and flowing\r\nin meandering courses across the marsh. The great variety of types of\r\nvegetation probably is one cause of the remarkable meandering of these\r\ndrainage lines by reason of the fact that the accumulated remains as\r\nwell as the annual growth of different weeds and grasses offer varying\r\nresistance to the current of the streams. Scale, about 1:10,000.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMARSH DRAINAGE\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking characteristics of marsh topography illustrated\r\nby the photographs presented here is the great wealth of drainage lines\r\nand the resemblance of the drainage patterns to those of river systems\r\ndeveloped on higher ground. The dendritic patterns, the meanders, and\r\nthe sharply outlined divides are surprising in areas which have\r\naltitudes varying from only a few inches to a little more than a foot at\r\ntimes of ordinary high tide and which are wholly submerged at times of\r\nmaximum tide. Some of the streams have gently winding courses suggestive\r\nof normal stream development. Others, particularly the smaller, have a\r\nconspicuous angularity of course. It is possible that the latter may\r\nhave originated as the trails of animals. Some of the lines are observed\r\nto cross the larger streams and are probably tracks made by muskrats.\r\nSome of the streams rise close to the river’s brink and lead to\r\nthrough-going waterways near the center of the marsh. This suggests the\r\ndeposition of silt on the brink of the river at times of high water. The\r\nnotched appearance of the shore in Figure 20 seems to be due to\r\noverhanging bunches of sedge grass and, in some instances, to the\r\nbreaking away of the surface mat or crust of the marsh formed by the\r\ninterlacing roots of grass. The mottled appearance of the marsh in this\r\npicture may be partly due to shadow of clouds, but to some extent, at\r\nleast, the difference in shade is caused by differences in the character\r\nof the plants.\r\n\r\nThe marshes used for illustration here are typical of many along the\r\nAtlantic Coast. They are situated near West Point, Va. The Pamunkey and\r\nthe Mattaponi Rivers both rise in the Piedmont Plateau, flow\r\nsoutheastward through the tidewater portion of Virginia, and join about\r\nmidway of the Coastal Plain to form the York River[3] (see Fig. 58).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20--Details of marshland. A part of Lee Marsh near\r\nWest Point, Va. (cf. Fig. 26), as photographed from a height of 2,000\r\nfeet, June, 1920. Local observers report that this marsh has been\r\nsubmerged only twice in nineteen years. The drainage systems are well\r\nentrenched. The larger stream channels are cut 1 to 5 feet or more below\r\nlow tide (the tidal variation at West Point is about 3.4 feet), and\r\ntheir form is made stable by the tough surface crust of the marsh,\r\nconsisting of the matted roots of the luxuriant sedge grass. The\r\nintricate, veinlike appearance of the drainage lines and the furry\r\nappearance of the edges of all the waterways, showing overhanging\r\nvegetation, are of interest.

Cousaic Marsh lies to the left and Hill Marsh\r\nto the right of the central meander. Some of the watercourses in these\r\nmarshes are thoroughfares, or channels opening to the river at both\r\nends, that can be traversed by boat at high tide.

The cross section at the left lies along the line\r\nindicated on the map and extends somewhat beyond its borders. The\r\nsomewhat greater height of the map than of the photograph, although both\r\ncover exactly the same area, is due to the unavoidable slight difference\r\nin tilt of each of the exposures of which the photographic mosaic is\r\nmade up. This illustrates the fact that airplane photographs cannot be\r\ndirectly used as equivalent to maps, until the necessary adjustments\r\nhave been made.

Eltham Marsh, in the center of the illustration, is traversed\r\nby a so-called thoroughfare, through which boats of light draft make\r\ntheir way at high tide. At one point in the middle of the marsh the\r\nthoroughfare is perceptibly broader than elsewhere, and the tidal\r\ncurrents entering from opposite ends of the thoroughfare meet there and\r\ncause slack water in which silt is deposited, forming mud flats exposed\r\nat low tide. The cultivated fields south of the marsh are on a bench\r\nabout 10 feet higher than the marsh.

The cross section at the left lies along the line\r\nindicated on the map and extends somewhat beyond its borders. Scale,\r\n1:31,000.]\r\n\r\nThe York is one of the estuaries of the tidewater portion of Virginia,\r\nand the water level at West Point, the junction of the two tributaries,\r\nrises and falls about 3½ feet under tidal action. The Pamunkey is\r\naffected by the tide 53 miles by channel above West Point, and the\r\nMattaponi 42 miles. Much of the broad lowland along these rivers is\r\nmarshy, but the largest marshes are found near West Point, where the\r\nriver current in swinging from side to side has formed great meanders.\r\nFor some reason the valleys eroded long ago by these streams have filled\r\nwith sediment here to a greater extent than farther downstream; perhaps\r\nbecause this is essentially the head of sea water, so that the checking\r\nof the current of the river causes it to deposit much of its load. Sea\r\nwater regularly mingles with the river water as far upstream as West\r\nPoint, but above this point the water is chiefly fresh. The marshes\r\nconsist of soft mud and muck to a considerable depth. A well driven in\r\nHill Marsh to an underlying artesian horizon penetrated 50 feet of this\r\nsoft material before entering rock such as is exposed in the river bank.\r\nThe thickness of the mud is comparable to the maximum depth of the York\r\nfarther downstream and suggests that the old valley which there is\r\nfilled with water is here filled to a depth of 50 feet or more with\r\nsediment brought down by the river. Only a small part of the marsh near\r\nthe landward margin has surface material firm enough to support the\r\nweight of large animals except when the surface is frozen.\r\n\r\nMany kinds of marsh plants grow here, among which is sedge grass\r\n(_Spartina cynosuroides_ (L.) Willd.), which grows to a height of 10\r\nfeet or more and forms dense thickets. Its roots interlace to form a\r\ntough mat which in some places will support the weight of a man. In\r\nother places the soft muck reaches to the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n“THOROUGHFARES”\r\n\r\nThese marshes are cut by a few waterways open at both ends, known as\r\nthoroughfares, or tidal runs, which also serve as the trunk streams\r\nthrough which the marsh is drained. Some of the thoroughfares may be\r\ntrunk streams modified by tides, or they may be silted remnants of\r\nabandoned river channels. Some seem to be channels in the last stages of\r\nsilting. The incoming tide enters the down-river end but ascends the\r\nthoroughfare more slowly than it ascends the river. The tide in the\r\nriver reaches the upper end of the thoroughfare, enters it, and meets\r\nthe opposing tide within the marsh near the upstream end of the\r\npassageway. Where the tides meet, thus causing slack water, silt is\r\ndeposited and mud flats are formed. In Eltham Marsh (Fig. 26) these\r\nflats are well within the marsh. In the larger thoroughfares of Sweet\r\nHall Marsh (Fig. 24) the tide passes entirely through while the tide in\r\nthe river is making its long way around, so that slack water and the\r\ndeposition of silt occur at the extreme upper end of the passage. In all\r\nof the thoroughfares the silting has reached the stage that precludes\r\ntheir use by boat, except at times of high water. Even at high tide some\r\nare navigable only by small skiffs, although throughout much of the\r\ncourse the water is many feet deep.\r\n\r\nSome of the thoroughfares become narrow and shallow upstream in a manner\r\nthat suggests that they originate as two normal streams flowing in\r\nopposite directions from a common point and that they were later united\r\nby the breaking down of the divide between their headwaters. Such a\r\njunction might be affected by an unusually high tide breaking through a\r\ndivide and cutting a channel. Such a divide, be it noted, consists of\r\nsoft mud only a few inches above the general level and might readily be\r\nbroken down. In some instances the connection may have originated as an\r\nanimal trail, as we have seen. Muskrats, otters, and other marsh\r\nanimals use the waterways as lines of travel and make paths in between\r\nthem from one to another. Apparently many of the small drainage lines\r\noriginated in this way, but in some instances stream systems of\r\nconsiderable size and complexity are independent of all others and\r\npossess all the characteristics of normally developed river systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCOASTAL MUD FLATS\r\n\r\n(FIGS. 28 AND 29)\r\n\r\n\r\nOf frequent occurrence along the Atlantic Coast of the United States are\r\nlow mud flats which are practically at sea level and which are covered\r\nwith water at times of high tide. Where these tracts are exposed to the\r\nair during ebb tide for so short a time that plants have not taken root\r\nand where the surface material is fine-grained and soft, the tracts are\r\nknown as mud flats. In the part of the peninsula between Delaware and\r\nChesapeake Bays belonging to the state of Virginia which is called the\r\nEastern Shore a low barrier beach of sand has formed on the ocean side\r\nseveral miles off shore, and the space between this and the mainland is\r\noccupied by mud flats, broad, shallow lagoons, and an intricate maze of\r\ninterlacing channels and winding, branching, interlocking, vermicular\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nThe mud flats are exposed for a short time during low tide, and, as the\r\nsurface of the water here rises and falls with the tide more than 4\r\nfeet, with a maximum fluctuation considerably greater, large volumes of\r\nwater are continually flowing backward and forward over the flats. As\r\nthe tide rises, strong currents of sea water set in through the inlets,\r\nflow up the main channels and through the thoroughfares, and gradually\r\nfind their way into the countless small channels and out of them over\r\nthe broad level stretches of soft mud. As the tide falls, this action is\r\nreversed, and the broad sheet of water finds its way by devious paths\r\nthrough the winding watercourses out to sea. The larger channels extend\r\nconsiderably below the surface at times of highest water and may be\r\nquite deep even at times of low water. They are, perhaps, stream courses\r\nexcavated before the region was drowned. Many of the smaller channels\r\nalso have the general form characteristic of normal stream channels,\r\nalthough others show peculiarities not common to subaerial drainage. The\r\norigin of these submarine and tidal features is not well understood, but\r\nthe photographs of them show their form and furnish some basis for a\r\nstudy of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28--A stream system of the mud-flat area on the\r\nocean side of the Eastern Shore, Virginia. The light-colored area is\r\nbeach sand above water. The treelike form is a stream system of\r\nsubnormally developed pattern.

The\r\nlight-colored ribbon-like bands represent water-filled channels; and the\r\ndarker-colored areas, either wet mud exposed to the air or mud slightly\r\nsubmerged. However, photographs taken under certain conditions of light\r\nmay show the exact line between the exposed and the drowned portions of\r\na land surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSUBMERGED LAND FORMS\r\n\r\n(FIGS. 30 TO 33)\r\n\r\n\r\nHeretofore the study of beaches, deltas, and other partly submerged land\r\nforms has been chiefly confined to the exposed parts, the underwater\r\nforms being largely matters of conjecture. By means of air photographs\r\nnot only can the exposed parts of the delta and beach be studied, but\r\nthe forms of shoals and terraces, the underwater portions of river\r\ndeltas, tidal deltas and their underwater distributaries, and many other\r\nsubmerged forms can be shown clearly. Sand bars, terraces, and other\r\nsubmerged forms appear in many of the photographs already presented; but\r\na few so taken that the bars and terraces appear to be the chief objects\r\nin the picture may be useful for illustrating the underwater land forms\r\nand for demonstrating that these forms can be successfully photographed.\r\nUnfortunately not many photographs could be found which were taken with\r\nthe express object in view of illustrating underwater land features. In\r\nmost of the available photographs these features were only incidental,\r\nthe chief purpose in taking them being to photograph the shore.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written concerning the physiographic history of the\r\nAtlantic Coastal Plain of the United States, and the question is still\r\nbeing debated whether the land is rising, sinking, or stationary. To\r\nsome extent these questions are answered by the exposed land forms. The\r\nsubmarine forms are imperfectly known. The possibility of recognizing\r\nshoals and channels from a photograph and of determining in some measure\r\nthe shapes of the submerged land forms opens a new avenue of approach to\r\nthe study of submarine geography. In some places, especially in regions\r\nof drowned topography, it is possible that, by using the air photograph\r\nin working out the physiographic processes that have produced the land\r\nforms that are now under water, some of the vexing problems of earth\r\nhistory may be solved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30 (left)--Sand bars and drowned terrace about Stove\r\nPoint Neck, at the mouth of the Piankatank River, Virginia, as\r\nphotographed from a height of about 10,000 feet at 11:30 A.M., December\r\n11, 1920. West (left) of the neck, at the outer edge of the terrace, the\r\nwater is 2 to 3 feet deep at low tide, or 5.7 feet and 6.7 feet at high\r\ntide, but deepens abruptly westward, where it is 20 to 30 feet deep in\r\nFishing Bay (see Fig. 32).

Scale, 1:70,000.]\r\n\r\nThe photographic study of underwater land forms is relatively new, and\r\nlittle information concerning it is available. It is annoyingly obvious\r\nto the air observer that at times he can see nothing beneath the surface\r\nof the water, whereas at other\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33--A drowned valley: Lambs Creek, 8 miles southeast\r\nof Yorktown, Va., one of the estuary-streams tributary to Chesapeake\r\nBay, showing the broad mouth narrowing upstream and the irregular\r\nmargins caused by partial submergence of the valley slopes, eroded\r\nbefore the rise of the water to its present height. Even the vertical\r\nphotograph, which does not register relative elevations, shows a\r\ndistinct difference between the shore line of this type of body of water\r\nand rivers with broad, low flood plains. The large trees close to the\r\nmargin of the river and the cultivated fields just back of them indicate\r\na relatively high bank. Scale, about 1:9,000.]\r\n\r\ntimes he can see with great distinctness. In trying to ascertain the\r\nmost favorable conditions for such observation, it was found that\r\nsubmerged objects are seen best when the sky is evenly overcast or when\r\nit is uniformly clear. Sometimes when the sky is only partly cloudy the\r\nsurface of the water seems to act as a mirror and nothing is seen but\r\nthe reflection of cloud and sky. Waves have less effect on the\r\nvisibility of objects beneath the surface than was expected, although\r\nthey diffuse the reflected light to some extent and consequently weaken\r\nthe image on the negative. But the reflected light from the surface of\r\nthe water is stronger than that coming from objects under water. Hence,\r\nto photograph underwater features successfully, a time should be chosen\r\nwhen direct reflection of light from the sun or from a brightly\r\nilluminated cloud will not enter the lens.\r\n\r\nExperience in both the air and the laboratory shows that the best\r\nresults are likely to be obtained when the sunlight strikes the surface\r\nat an oblique angle. In summer favorable times are mid-forenoon or\r\nmid-afternoon under an evenly illuminated sky. In winter the sun is low\r\nenough at midday to avoid direct reflection into the lens. But\r\nexperience also indicates that often photographs taken at moments when\r\nthe eye caught the image of a submerged object show only the surface of\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE PLAIN FROM THE AIR\r\n\r\n(FIGS. 34 TO 41)\r\n\r\n\r\nA RIVER ON THE GREAT PLAINS\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of photographing a plain from a point on its surface\r\nneeds no emphasis, but its successful representation by means of air\r\nphotographs is illustrated by many figures in this book. The Great\r\nPlains of the west-central part of the United States are illustrated\r\nhere by a view of the Red River (Fig. 36), which shows the flat surface\r\nof the land and the broad sandy bed of the river only partly covered by\r\nthe intricately woven strands of the braided channels--a scene\r\ncharacteristic of the Great Plains.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANDERING STREAMS ON THE COASTAL PLAIN\r\n\r\nThe ox-bow curves of meandering streams are among the features of the\r\nearth’s surface most familiar to the student of physical geography; yet,\r\nheretofore, they have been illustrated only by maps, constructed at\r\ngreat labor and expense. Comprehensive photographs of them are rare and\r\nare, at best, imperfect and unsatisfactory for purposes of illustration.\r\nOn the other hand, meandering streams lend themselves admirably to air\r\nphotography. Equally familiar to the student of geography and\r\nphysiography is the term “abandoned meander.” These ancient stream\r\ncourses, many of which are now occupied by marsh, brush, or forest, have\r\nbeen still more difficult to illustrate by means of photographs. In some\r\ninstances wooded meanders like those near Columbus, Ga. (Fig. 34), long\r\nago abandoned by the stream that formed them, are shown in air pictures\r\nin a manner but little less conspicuous than the meanders of the\r\npresent-day stream. It is believed that instructors will find Figure 34\r\nuseful, not only in illustrating meandering streams and abandoned\r\nmeanders but also in showing how meanders develop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34--The Chattahoochee River south of Columbus, Ga.,\r\nshowing the results of progressive lateral shifting of a meandering\r\nstream. In the upper part of the illustration to the left (west) of the\r\nstream are light-colored concentric markings which probably represent\r\nthe gradual shifting of the stream toward the right. As interpreted from\r\nthe information at hand, this section of the stream at one time occupied\r\na position much farther west than now. It cut away the bank on the east,\r\nforming a curved course, depositing sand and mud on the inside of the\r\ncurve. This typical feature of stream erosion and deposition is to be\r\nnoted from the picture of the present course of the stream. At the\r\noutside of each meander stretches of the bank appear light-colored and\r\ndenuded of the trees and bushes that line the bank elsewhere. These are\r\nscours, a slipping away of the bluff caused by the cutting of the stream\r\ninto the foot of the bank at points where the velocity of the outside of\r\nthe current, and consequently its corrosive power, is increased as it\r\nswings round the curve. The inside of the sharpest meander shows also\r\nthe deposit of material due to the fact that the velocity of the inside\r\nof the current is checked by the bank, causing it to deposit some of its\r\nload. Added to this deposit is much of the material brought by\r\ncross-currents from the opposite-lying scour. The light-colored banks\r\nare probably successive deposits. Finally, either by a gradual wearing\r\naway or by some whim of the current at flood tide, the river chose a\r\nshorter course, leaving its old channel as an abandoned meander. Farther\r\nsouth several abandoned meanders may be distinguished, each\r\ndistinctively marked by a steep bank on the outside of the curve and\r\nconcentric bandings on the inside. The abandoned channels are especially\r\nmarked by the trees and brush that fill them in many places. It appears\r\nthat a well-developed growth of trees is to be found only along the\r\nriver banks in this region and the growth in the abandoned channels is\r\nprobably due to the fact that in flood time there is much seepage of\r\nwater into these old channels if not an actual overflow from the present\r\ncourse of the stream. At the bottom of the picture is to be seen the\r\nrecently made land under cultivation. The fields appear striated and\r\ncheckered, obscuring the concentric banding. The illustration is from a\r\nmosaic made up at Camp Benning near-by of many photographs matched\r\ntogether, hence there are certain differences in shade due to dark and\r\nlight prints.

Between the bluffs is seen the\r\ndark-colored water of the braided stream flowing on a broad sandy bed\r\nmore than a mile wide, which is completely covered with water only at\r\nflood time. The river forms the Texas-Oklahoma boundary, and frequent\r\nchanges in the position of the channel during periods of high water make\r\nthe exact position of the interstate boundary uncertain and give rise to\r\ndisputes and litigation over the ownership of land. North of the river\r\n(top of figure) to the right are sand dunes with a sprinkling of trees\r\nand bushes; in the middle of the channel there is an island of\r\nlight-colored sand. The stream channel bites sharply into the southern\r\nbluff, which is cut by many strong gulches. Across the river is the\r\nfamiliar sand flat built of the material washed downstream at flood time\r\nand spread out by the subsiding water. The channel at this point shows\r\nthe changes that have taken place in the position of the stream and,\r\nwhere the stream crosses the sandy floor, affords an example of\r\nbraiding.

Scale, 1:14,000.]\r\n\r\nSome of the characteristics of a third type of plain, the glacial drift\r\nplain, are shown in Figures 37 to 41. Here are pictured glacial lakes,\r\nbogs, marshes, moraines, and outwash plains, peat-filled depressions,\r\nkettleholes and gullied slopes--typical features of a glaciated region.\r\nThe views show, also, many of the familiar aspects of the central and\r\nwestern parts of the United States: the rectangular pattern formed by\r\nthe land subdivisions established by the United States Land Office, the\r\ncheckerboard pattern being emphasized by the section-line roads; the\r\nminor subdivisions into fields; and the cultivation of a variety of\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41--Kettleholes and other depressions in glacial\r\ntill, on the Grand Trunk Railway about 5 miles southwest of Schoolcraft,\r\nMich. The distance between the eastern (right) edge of this view and the\r\nwestern (left) of Fig. 37 is about 1 mile. Scale, about 1:15,000.]\r\n\r\nThese photographs were selected from a series taken as an experiment in\r\nmap-making. In June, 1920, the United States Air Service sent a plane\r\nequipped with a K-1 camera from Dayton, Ohio, to Schoolcraft, Mich,\r\nwhere in seven hours’ flying time a fifteen-minute quadrangle, about 220\r\nsquare miles, was photographed. The prints were matched together and\r\nreduced to a scale of 1:48,000. From them such features as roads,\r\nstreams, forests, land corners, etc., were transferred to plane-table\r\nsheets, which the topographic engineers on the ground then used for\r\ncontouring the relief. Figure 38 is a part of the preliminary proof of\r\nthis map. It may be added that the experiment is regarded as highly\r\nfavorable to the use of the airplane camera as an instrument in\r\nmapping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN FEATURES\r\n\r\n(FIGS. 42 TO 52)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn obtaining photographic illustrations from the ground of mountains,\r\ncanyons, and associated land forms, the same difficulty, but in\r\nexaggerated form, is encountered that obtains in securing an\r\nadvantageous point of view for small objects. The difficulty is overcome\r\nin large measure by the use of aircraft. In an airplane the observer can\r\nrise above the obstructions which interfere with the view desired; can\r\nlook an isolated mountain peak squarely in the face, as in the case of\r\nthe photograph of Mt. Shasta (Fig. 42); can study the details of its ice\r\ncap (Fig. 42) and gaze downward on the lateral and recessional moraines\r\nleft by the retreat of the mountain’s glaciers (Fig. 43). Few volcanic\r\ncraters, occurring as they do at the top of cones, have been\r\nsuccessfully photographed unless some higher mountain stands near-by on\r\nwhich a favorable viewpoint can be found. From an airplane, however, one\r\ncan look into the very throat of a crater, as into that of Cinder Cone\r\n(Fig. 48), near Lassen Peak, California.\r\n\r\nMuch attention has been given to the interrelations of canyons, gorges,\r\nand mountain ridges, but these relations have hitherto been illustrated\r\nchiefly by means of maps and charts. Figures 49, 50, and 52 picture\r\nthree relations more expressively than any map. To the experienced\r\ngeographer a map may illustrate perfectly the action of a stream working\r\nheadward into higher land; but the student to whom the conception of\r\nheadward erosion is new will certainly grasp the idea more readily from\r\nthe picture presented in Figure 52. No map could give so clear a\r\nconception of a maturely dissected highland as does a photograph like\r\nthat of the Santa Monica Mountains (Fig. 50).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42--A glaciated volcanic Cone: Mt. Shasta,\r\nCalifornia, 14,162 feet high, as seen by an airplane observer from the\r\nnortheast, showing Hotlum Glacier in the foreground and Wintun Glacier\r\nat the extreme left. The monadnock which separates the two main lobes of\r\nHotlum Glacier appears as the dark-colored mass of rock in the midst of\r\nthe ice. To be noted are the many indications of movement in the\r\nglaciers shown by curved lines, eddies, and crevasses, and the glacial\r\nstreams flowing away from the ends of the glaciers. The long lobe at the\r\nleft center shows the formation of both lateral and recessional as well\r\nas terminal moraines.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43--A glacial gorge on the northeastern face of Mt.\r\nShasta, California, below Hotlum Glacier (see Fig. 42), the lower end of\r\nwhich is to be seen in the upper part of the photograph. At the left are\r\ntwo ridges, one the edge of a sheet of flow lava, the other, in part at\r\nleast, a lateral moraine. In the center, at the bottom of the gorge,\r\nbetween the two white lines which represent glacial streams, is a system\r\nof concentric ridges which are probably recessional moraines. At the\r\nright is the western slope of the gorge. (This figure is the lower\r\noverlapping continuation of Fig. 42.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44--Yosemite Valley, California, a typical\r\nice-shaped gorge, showing at the left the granite face of El Capitan,\r\nabout 3,000 feet above the bottom of the famous gorge, and, at the\r\nright, the pinnacle of Sentinel Rock and the well-known form of Half\r\nDome. At the sky line in the center of the picture is Clouds Rest, and\r\nwell down in the gorge Washington Column and the Royal Arches can be\r\ndistinguished.]\r\n\r\nThese photographs have the advantage of appealing to the mind through\r\nthe sense of vision and will serve the same purpose as plaster models.\r\nThus, in Figure 52, a variety of topographic forms are to be\r\ndistinguished, including slightly dissected highlands with sharply\r\nincised gorges; maturely dissected highlands made up now of canyons and\r\nridges; a mountain valley broadening out toward an intermontane plain;\r\nseveral arroyos; and many minor features.\r\n\r\nIn the interpretation of the features shown in a vertical view of a\r\nmountainous country the orientation of the photograph is of prime\r\nimportance. When viewed in proper orientation, that is, as already\r\npointed out (p. 5), with the shadows falling toward the observer,\r\nmountains and valleys appear in their correct relation. But, if the\r\nposition of the picture is reversed, a mountain will look like a\r\ndepression and a valley like a ridge. This reversal of the image can be\r\ntested by looking at Figures 49 or 52 from both viewpoints. However,\r\nsince the vertical photographs will be compared with maps of the same\r\narea, it is thought better to place them on the page as if they were\r\nmaps. In order to make them appear natural the prints can be turned in\r\nthe necessary direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45--Map of the Yosemite Valley, showing the area\r\nincluded within the angle of vision of Fig. 44.

For instance, an area of\r\nupturned sedimentary rocks would be readily distinguished from one of\r\nhorizontal rocks. Figure 42 shows how the character of glaciated\r\nmountains is revealed, and Figures 37 to 41 of the Michigan area show\r\nwell the familiar features of continental glaciation.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps premature to say much of the use of the airplane in the\r\nstudy of geology until it has been thoroughly tested. But it should be\r\npossible from the air to locate and map ore bodies, metalliferous veins,\r\nand outcrops of rock: for it is well known that rocks at the outcrop\r\ndiffer in color, in the forms of erosion developed in them, and in the\r\nkind of plants which they support. It is of interest that Colonel Alfred\r\nH. Brooks, who was Chief Geologist of the American Expeditionary Forces\r\nin France during the war, found that geologic boundaries could be\r\nrecognized on air photographs and that by means of these photographs he\r\ncould correct existing geologic maps and identify\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53--Canyon in sedimentary rocks near the mouth of\r\nthe Pecos River, Texas. The rocks consist of flat-lying strata, and the\r\ntortuous lines resembling the grain in wood denote the outcrops of hard\r\nlayers and the benches formed on these layers by erosion. This\r\nphotograph illustrates the use of air photography in geological\r\nreconnaissance. Scale not known.]\r\n\r\nformations in inaccessible areas within the enemy lines. His method was\r\nto use air photographs in the study of the geologic formations of areas\r\naccessible to him. Then, having familiarized himself with the appearance\r\nof the different rock formations and structures on the photographs, he\r\nwas able to recognize the same features on photographs of areas held by\r\nthe enemy and so project his mapping over into inaccessible\r\nterritory.[4]\r\n\r\nThe prospector should effect a great saving of time by using air\r\nphotographs to guide him to places where he can find exposures of rock\r\nand to help him to avoid places where it would be useless to look for\r\nexposures. Particularly in wooded regions air photographs are valuable\r\nin indicating localities where exposures can be found in areas so\r\ncovered with forest that examination on the ground would not be worthy\r\nof consideration. Prospectors for oil are planning to use airplanes for\r\nthis purpose in northern Canada, in South America, and in other places\r\nwhere much of the country is so densely wooded that much time is usually\r\nspent in looking for clear space.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE IN EXPLORATION\r\n\r\nExploratory work should benefit in many ways. General reconnaissance has\r\nbeen carried on to a considerable extent in foreign lands with airplanes\r\nand to some extent also in America. Wide areas along the Mexican border\r\nhave been photographed for the making of new maps and for the correction\r\nof existing maps. The same photographs would be useful in geologic\r\nreconnaissance. The new photographs of southern Arizona are said to show\r\nmountain ranges many miles away from their location on existing maps.\r\nSuch corrections are of importance to the geologist as well as to the\r\ngeographer and the map-maker. Amundsen intends to employ several small\r\nplanes in his Arctic work now under way. Mjöberg[5] has projected an\r\nexpedition to New Guinea in which the use of airplanes is a fundamental\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nMAPPING AND CHARTING FROM THE AIR\r\n\r\n(FIGS. 54 TO 82)\r\n\r\n\r\nMention has already been made (p. 56) of the experiment in map-making\r\ncarried out by the Army Air Service and the United States Geological\r\nSurvey at Schoolcraft, Mich. The results of that experiment and of\r\nothers of the sort are sufficient to establish the fact that the air\r\ncamera is destined to become a valuable addition to the map-maker’s\r\nequipment. The extent to which it will be used depends, of course, upon\r\nthe degree to which its present imperfections are corrected and its\r\npossibilities developed. The Board of Surveys and Maps of the United\r\nStates government has recently published the results of its study of air\r\nphotography for use in map-making.[6]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54--View across the western end of Lake Erie,\r\nlooking in a northeasterly direction (see Fig. 55). Oblique photograph\r\ntaken from 18,000 feet above Port Clinton, Ohio, by Lieut. G.

The\r\nmonument commemorating this victory can be distinguished in the\r\nphotograph as a white shaft.\r\n\r\nAlthough most vertical airplane photographs are in the nature of\r\nlarge-scale maps, this view illustrates how a large area can be covered\r\nin an oblique view taken at a high altitude--an area, when transformed,\r\nof appreciable size even on a small-scale map, such as, for example,\r\nFig. 55.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55--Map of the western end of Lake Erie showing the\r\narea covered within the angle of vision of Fig. 54.

In all of these maps a degree of accuracy is\r\ndemanded that will give the exact location of all the features included\r\non the map and permit the precise measurement of distances between them.\r\nTo obtain such accuracy necessitates an elaborate system of control\r\nstations as a basis on which the surveyor works out his triangulations\r\nand traverses. In the United States these controls have been established\r\nprincipally by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey.[9] To\r\nconstruct a map from air photographs, varying in scale and distorted as\r\nthey often are because of the impossibility of holding the plane at an\r\nabsolute level and because of the stretching or shrinkage of the\r\nphotographic paper, would require a great amount of triangulation and\r\ntraverse in order that the control might be sufficiently detailed to\r\npermit the accurate mounting of the photographic prints. But, given\r\nthese controls, the air camera can, without further adaptation, supply\r\ndetails that heretofore required the laborious processes of plane-table\r\nmapping. The topographer can place the two-dimensional details from\r\nphotographs and then go into the field with only the contouring to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58--Index map showing the location of the areas\r\nshown on airplane photographs in this book within the Atlantic seaboard\r\nof the northeastern United States, except those whose exact location is\r\nunknown (Figs. 21, 23, 28, 29, and 77).

Note that a wave breaks into foam at the point of each cusp.\r\nScale, about 1:9,000.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE IN CITY MAPPING\r\n\r\nIn city mapping, even though time be taken to establish a very elaborate\r\nsystem of controls, the air camera can accomplish in a few hours a task\r\nof years by ordinary methods. In fact it is only by means of air\r\nphotographs that maps of a growing city can be kept at all up to date.\r\nParis was mapped with 800 plates in less than one day of actual flying.\r\nWashington was completely mapped in two and a half hours with less than\r\n200 exposures.[10] For the mosaic of Rochester, N. Y. (Fig. 56) 82\r\nphotographs were made in one hour and twenty minutes. There is no reason\r\nwhy such a mosaic with an original survey or even a number of accurately\r\nlocated points as a basis of control should not be sufficiently accurate\r\nfor all purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE IN REVISION OF EXISTING MAPS\r\n\r\nAnother immediate use of air photographs in mapping is in the correction\r\nand revision of existing maps. So far as individual features are\r\nconcerned, the air photograph is an exact record of the area exposed to\r\nits lens, and natural and artificial features are easily transferred\r\nfrom the picture to the map. Its great value in the saving of time and\r\nmoney has been demonstrated in the rapidly developing territory near Los\r\nAngeles. In 1893 the Santa Monica quadrangle was surveyed, and houses,\r\nroads, etc., as they existed at that time, are shown on the map. This\r\narea was later built up and so changed that the map was practically\r\nworthless. From information derived from air photographs the map was\r\nrevised in 1920 (Fig. 51). Evidence has already been given of the\r\nefficiency of the air photograph in elaborating maps where the\r\nimportance of the region is not sufficient to warrant the expense of a\r\ndetailed survey of minor features, and in mapping areas inaccessible\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62--Beach cusps extended under water and showing the\r\ninterference of waves off the curved beach on the bay side north of\r\nBeach Haven, N.

They are the distributaries of this underwater delta. Scale, about\r\n1:11,000.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE IN COAST CHARTING\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65--A tidal delta built up until it is partly above\r\nwater: Popes Creek, Virginia, on the right bank of the lower Potomac\r\nRiver, 4 miles southeast of Colonial Beach, as seen obliquely from a\r\nheight of 4,000 feet at 3:30 P.M., August 31, 1920. The tidal currents\r\nfrom the Potomac have built hook-shaped bars nearly across the outlet of\r\nthe creek, and the inflowing currents have built a delta from the mouth\r\nof the creek upstream.]\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate for those engaged in the study of shore features and the\r\nmapping of coasts that, being flat, shore features are particularly well\r\nadapted to representation by air photographs, for on coasts exposed to\r\nthe wind and waves the channels, shoals and bars are continually\r\nchanging. Air photography offers a quick and convenient means of keeping\r\ncharts up to date. The intricacies of the water line in some places\r\nmakes accurate charting by the ordinary survey methods a slow, laborious\r\nprocess. When bluffs or relatively steep slopes, like those of York\r\nRiver, Virginia, near Gloucester Point, shown in Figure 60,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.

To the east\r\n(right) the breaking waves and shadowy depths indicate the position of\r\nshoals. West of the surf belt are the light-colored beach sand, shading\r\noff from the conspicuous hook at the southern end of Island Beach into\r\nunderwater shoals and bars, and older surfaces made dark-colored by the\r\ngrowth of plants. South of the hook are the inlet leading into Barnegat\r\nBay and the northern end of Long Beach, at the point of which stands a\r\nlighthouse whose long shadow is to be seen across the beach sand. The\r\nmottled appearance of the bay to the left is due to shoals slightly\r\nsubmerged or perhaps exposed at low tide, where dark-colored drainage\r\nlines appear, and shading off to deeper water, where the submerged land\r\nforms have a shadowy appearance. The distribution of the shoals\r\nindicates that this is a double tidal delta, an infacing part west of\r\nthe inlet and an ocean-facing part to the right.

J., connecting the Atlantic Ocean to the right\r\n(east) with Little Egg Harbor to the left. The beach sand south of the\r\ninlet is little above water level and is frequently washed by waves,\r\nwhich shift the sand and produce the clouded appearance of the sandy\r\nsurface. The light-colored ragged belt at the right is surf; the\r\ncontinuous narrow belt, beach sand; the clouded areas, recently washed\r\nwet or slightly submerged sand. (The ordinary tidal variation here is\r\n4.2 feet.) This inlet does not appear on the 1914 edition of U. S. Coast\r\nand Geodetic Survey Chart 1216, and sand hooks had little more than\r\nbegun to form then. Scale, about 1:14,000.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68. (For explanation see bottom of next page.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68--Beach between Brigantine and Little Egg Inlets,\r\nNew Jersey, showing a variety of features characteristic of a wave-built\r\nsand barrier. The upper (northern) part of the illustration shows\r\nseveral places where waves have broken over the sand barrier and washed\r\nthe sand westward, where it was redeposited at the left in the quiet,\r\nprotected water. Farther south are older wash-overs, where the enclosed\r\nbay is nearly filled with sand. At the left are numerous islands,\r\nstreams, and flats characteristic of the salt marshes west of the\r\nbarrier beach along the New Jersey coast. Scale, about 1:7,000.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69--A simple spit: Lower Cedar Point, Maryland, on\r\nthe left bank of the lower Potomac River, 6 miles north of Colonial\r\nBeach, Va., as seen obliquely downward from a height of 4,000 feet. The\r\nwhite line on either side of the point is sand at the foot of bluffs.\r\nHouses and fields are seen at the left.]\r\n\r\noccur along the shore, the water line varies little from year to year.\r\nBut on very low lands, like those along Chesapeake Bay south of the\r\nmouth of York River, shown in Figure 59, the strand may migrate over a\r\nbroad belt between high and low tide. For this reason it is desirable\r\nthat photographs of areas affected by the tide be accompanied by a\r\nrecord of the date and time of day at which the exposure was made, in\r\norder that the height of the tide at the time of exposure can be\r\ncomputed. As the shore on the Coast and Geodetic Survey charts denotes\r\nthe water line at high tide, a photograph taken at low tide might be\r\ninterpreted as indicating an error on the chart. Where the water\r\nmigrates over such a broad belt of sand or mud, the problems of\r\ncharting become very troublesome. Photographs of such areas could be\r\ntaken at both low and high tide, and from these the belt of daily\r\nflooding could be charted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70--A hook, or recurved spit, south of Brigantine\r\nInlet, New Jersey, as photographed from a height of 10,000 feet, showing\r\nthe strong curving upstream characteristic of spits on this ocean-facing\r\ncoast.

During the flight the camera was maintained at an\r\naltitude of about 10,000 feet. The course was covered by 183 exposures\r\nmade at such intervals of time that the prints overlap. Unfortunately\r\nthe exposures were not sufficient to give all the details desired for\r\nmarsh and water areas, but prints were made on developing paper suitable\r\nfor showing extreme contrast. These were matched together and a\r\ncontinuous picture obtained.

Scale, about 1:12,000.]\r\n\r\nescaped attention during very detailed surveys. He states that with\r\nproper plates and ray filters the presence of objects invisible to the\r\neye is revealed by the camera.[13] Similar use of air photographs has\r\nbeen made by the English in charting reefs, shallows, and harbors.\r\nThomas says: “In 1917 aeroplane photography was successfully used for\r\ncharting the harbor of Rahbeg on the Arabian coast.”[14] It is a\r\nwell-known fact that, under proper conditions, objects submerged to a\r\nconsiderable depth under clear water can be seen from points high above\r\nthe surface. During the war, submarines were detected and followed by\r\nobservers in airplanes, and sunken vessels, mines, and other submerged\r\nobjects have been located by observation from the air. Illustrations in\r\nthis paper show the possibility of using this method of observation, to\r\nsome extent at least, in detecting and mapping shoals, channels, and\r\nother features under water.\r\n\r\nPhotographs of channels like those of the Potomac River and its\r\ntributaries will be commercially as well as scientifically valuable. The\r\ndeep-water channel of the Potomac is well known and has been charted;\r\nbut very little is known of many of the small tributary channels, such\r\nas that of Powells Creek (Fig. 75). Where the channels are not well\r\nknown, such a photograph could be used to advantage in avoiding the\r\nshoals, and, by surveyors, first in exploratory work and later as a\r\ngeneral guide in charting. Small boats entering this channel could use\r\nthe photographs either for the original location of the deep channel in\r\ncase no chart were available or for detecting changes in its course\r\nafter the chart was made. For uncharted channels, like those of many of\r\nthe tributaries of the Potomac River, air photography furnishes a quick\r\nand accurate means of location.\r\n\r\nNo amount of sounding, charting, or description could produce so\r\naccurate a mental picture of a drowned valley as that produced by Figure\r\n76. In Figures 78 and 79, both of which were taken near Miami, Florida,\r\nis illustrated the difference in appearance between natural and\r\nartificial channels. The straightaway course and regular outlines of the\r\ndredged channel contrast sharply with the winding course and merging\r\noutlines of the natural channel. To the student of physiography and\r\nearth history the photographs furnish a means of observation of a\r\ndefiniteness heretofore quite unthought-of. On them the actual shape of\r\nthe channels, submerged terraces, and drowned land forms are shown in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS UNDER WAY POINT TO PROMISING OUTLOOK FOR AIRPLANE\r\nPHOTOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nThere is, however, need of careful research to determine the conditions\r\nunder which the best results can be obtained. The height and time of day\r\nfor exposures with a certain lens, the emulsion and kind of ray filter\r\nbest suited under certain conditions, the effect of light as it enters\r\nand emerges from the water, and the effect of polarization are subjects\r\ndemanding consideration. Chief among the experiments now under way is\r\nthe determination of the kind of emulsion and ray filter or color screen\r\nthat will give the best results. It is a demonstrated fact that, with an\r\nemulsion sensitive to red light, objects in the air invisible to the eye\r\nbecause of intervening haze can be photographed through a red filter. It\r\nis possible that water can be penetrated in the same way and that\r\nfilters of other colors will prove advantageous.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the air photograph is only in its infancy--but an infancy\r\nfull of promise. As a means of securing new and advantageous views of\r\nsubjects of interest, it is not only entertaining but scientifically\r\nand commercially valuable. As an aid in mapping it can, even in its\r\npresent stage of development, serve an important purpose by supplying\r\naccurate knowledge of otherwise inaccessible regions, by furnishing\r\ndetails that are valuable but expensive to obtain, and by permitting the\r\nfrequent and inexpensive revision of existing maps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAccuracy, 1, 74\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments, viii, xi\r\n\r\nAerial photo-hydrography, 99\r\n\r\nAerial photo-topography, 93\r\n\r\nAir photographs, how to read, 4;\r\n  improvements under way, 102;\r\n  oblique and vertical, 1;\r\n  value in coast charting, 93, 99, 101\r\n\r\nAir photography, application, ix;\r\n  development, ix;\r\n  elements to be recorded, 2;\r\n  outlook, 102\r\n\r\nAir Services, co-operation, xi\r\n\r\nAircraft, x\r\n\r\nAirplane photography. _See_ Air photography\r\n\r\nAliso Creek, California, 68\r\n\r\nAmundsen, Roald, 71\r\n\r\nAnacostia flats, D.
