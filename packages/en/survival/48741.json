I. PHILADELPHIA, _Second Month_, 1820. _No. 2._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE TEACHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot exactly tell why it was, that I felt particularly\r\ninterested in the prospectus for the _Rural Magazine_; but I\r\ninstantly resolved to become a subscriber, and fell to ruminating\r\nupon the benefits it might confer upon the country. Whether I\r\nconceived at once the idea of writing these essays, and took to\r\nmyself a full share of its imagined usefulness and celebrity; or\r\nwhether my satisfaction arose from disinterested motives, I felt\r\na glow of kind feeling towards the editors, which expanded itself\r\nupon all around me. I dismissed my little school at an earlier hour\r\nthan usual, and having simply reprimanded some idle culprits, to\r\nwhom I should otherwise have administered the _ferule_, I devoted\r\nthe remainder of the afternoon to writing a letter to a friend in\r\ntown; in which I concluded a declamation upon the worthlessness of\r\nliterary fame, by requesting him to place my name in the list of\r\nsubscribers and contributors.\r\n\r\nSince then, the Magazine has frequently been the subject of my\r\nreveries; for the design is exactly what I have long desired to see\r\nattempted. Every man who has travelled half way up the hill of life,\r\nand has gained its fortieth milestone, will have amassed stores of\r\nthought and observation, which he is apt to think of inestimable\r\nvalue:--at least I find it so with me. There are many topics on\r\nwhich I differ from my friends, and in regard to which I am anxious\r\nto develope my opinions. Some others to which I attach a greater\r\nimportance than is usually done; and many upon which my particular\r\nstation in life has thrown lights which may be new and interesting\r\nto the public mind. For these reasons, I have long desired to extend\r\nmy voice and authority beyond the precincts of my little kingdom,\r\nand to try the experiment of schooling the public in some of those\r\ngreat truths, which are too little regarded or understood, and\r\nbringing back its taste to the pure and simple enjoyments of rural\r\nlife. Whether I shall succeed in my attempt to gain the public ear,\r\nwill depend, perhaps, upon accident; for while the greatest merit\r\nhas often languished in obscurity, folly and incapacity have as\r\noften caught the gale of popular favour. If I fail, I shall not\r\nbe without consolation; for the most unsuccessful author finds it\r\neasier to censure the public for want of penetration, than himself\r\nfor want of talent. I trust that I shall have occasion for no such\r\nreflections. It may be an author's vanity, and yet the voice of\r\npraise can scarcely reach my secluded abode; but my fancy already\r\npaints the bright eyes, and glowing cheeks that will hang over\r\nthese essays, and the sober approbation with which mature age will\r\nperceive that they are devoted to the cause of truth and sound\r\nmorality. Neighbour Schemer is welcome to pass over my numbers in\r\nsearch of the newest plans of farming, so long as he allows his\r\nblooming Emily to pause over them; and what do I care though old\r\nLovegain pronounce them to be stupid stuff? I had rather possess the\r\napprobation and esteem of his lovely Sophia, than half his acres!\r\n\r\nIt is a hopeless task, and may seem full of vanity, to enter the\r\nlists where so many have been foiled, and where all the great prizes\r\nhave been born away by the master spirits of former times. But not\r\nto mention that fame is no object of my pursuit; the lofty rewards\r\nI speak of, were gained by the finest geniuses in our language, and\r\nconferred by the approbation of the world. My humbler attempt is\r\nto please villagers and farmers; and my ambition will be attained,\r\nif they crown me with the fragrant and perishing wreath that shall\r\nresemble their grateful though short-lived recollections.\r\n\r\nCustom and authority have assigned to the essayist a peculiar\r\ncharacter. He is privileged at all places and in every family.\r\nChildhood loves and fondles upon him; and age and fashion, the man\r\nof pleasure and the man of business, alike consult and confide in\r\nhim: above all, he is the particular favourite of the ladies, and is\r\nsupposed to be knowing in all the labyrinths of the female heart,\r\nand all the points of etiquette and gallantry. He has, therefore,\r\nfrom time immemorial, been their faithful adviser, transmitted their\r\nbilletsdoux, and corrected their letters. He is a notable dreamer,\r\na great traveller, and a universal scholar: he generally passes for\r\na grey headed sage, and yet is a very Proteus in his appearance and\r\nbehaviour. The family is descended from Isaac Bickerstaff, esq.; a\r\nvenerable gentleman, who made a considerable figure, and acquired\r\nmuch substance in queen Anne's time. Some of his descendants have\r\nbeen solemn and pedantic, and others giddy and frolicksome; but\r\nthe features I have portrayed, run more or less through the whole\r\nfamily. Its enemies say that it is no longer what it was; that it\r\nhas retained its homely peculiarities, without its originality\r\nand freshness, its wit and gallantry of character. Gentle reader,\r\nbelieve me, this is an unfounded calumny!\r\n\r\nA branch of the family settled in this country about eighty years\r\nsince, and some of the American descendants have proved worthy of\r\nthe original stock. One of them, renouncing the social habits of\r\nhis kinsmen, went abroad among the fields and the solitudes of\r\nNature, and there poured forth his soul in strains, of which a poet\r\nmight have been emulous. It was he who first made the English Muses\r\nfamiliar with the sublimity of our native forests. Another, whose\r\nnatural disposition was checked by the force of circumstances,\r\ndevoted himself to the education of a favourite niece and nephew;\r\nand has given a signal example that an old bachelor is not always\r\na useless being. A third, more merry and more melancholy, more\r\nsarcastic and more eccentric than all who went before him, divided\r\nhis time between laughing at the world, and wandering over the\r\nscenes of his youthful and perished enjoyments. He still lives,\r\nalthough in a foreign clime and under an assumed name, to enjoy the\r\nlove and admiration of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nReader, I have already told thee how humble are my own pretensions.\r\nIf I do not attract thy regard from my own merits, love me for the\r\nsake of my family; and have a kind eye to my rude speech and rustic\r\nmanners, in the recollection of those from whom I boast to have\r\ndescended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nON THE PURSUIT OF PLEASURE.\r\n\r\n     ----Trahit sua quemque voluptas.... Virgil.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a fact which can never be successfully controverted, that man,\r\nin every stage of society, is addicted to pleasure; the uncultivated\r\nsavage, and the sage philosopher are equally devoted to the\r\nattainment of felicity; are equally desirous to secure a perpetuity\r\nof happiness. The benevolent Creator of the universe seems to have\r\nendowed the human race with faculties peculiarly susceptible of\r\npleasurable sensations; accordingly it becomes the business of\r\nevery one, almost from his first entrance into life, to seek after\r\nsuch pleasures as are peculiar to the bent of his disposition, and\r\nto avoid every object or pursuit that has a tendency to pain or\r\ndisappointment. If, however, all pleasures were in their nature\r\ninnocent, and left behind no sting of remorse and anxiety, still man\r\nwould inevitably soon feel the approaches of languor, especially\r\nwhilst indulging in a round of mere sensual gratifications, and\r\nwould earnestly sigh for some more permanent species of felicity; a\r\nfelicity which might gently affect his mind, without overpowering\r\nhis faculties in such a degree as to produce subsequent pain. But\r\nas the world is now constituted, it becomes the indispensable duty\r\nof the moralist, not only to guard mankind against excess in their\r\npleasures, but also to warn them against such as are accompanied\r\nwith vice and criminality. He therefore is not the true friend of\r\nmankind, who recommends to his fellow beings a continual abstinence\r\nfrom every gratification, or who would lead them to expect pleasure\r\nfrom sensual gratifications alone; but he who points out to their\r\nnotice, those delights which are most durable, and at the same time,\r\nconsistent with the strictest virtue.\r\n\r\nIt must, without hesitation, be allowed, that religion is the\r\nsource of the most exalted happiness that any human being can\r\nenjoy. Religion alone inspires the soul with a perfect dependance\r\non the goodness and love of the DEITY, and diffuses over the\r\nmind that calmness and serenity, which inevitably proceed from a\r\nreception of his mercy and benevolence, ever manifested towards\r\nall his creatures. All the pleasures of life are so many poisonous\r\ningredients in our cup, till religion purifies and destroys the\r\nnoxious qualities with which they are tainted. Let religion mingle\r\nwith our pleasures, and every thing of an evil tendency vanishes\r\nbefore it. Religion furnishes genius with its noblest theme, and\r\nit affords the fullest employment for all the energies of the\r\nhuman intellect. But another species of pleasure, most grateful,\r\nand ennobling to the human mind, arises from the exercise of the\r\nunderstanding in literary pursuits, and in the study and admiration\r\nof the various productions of human genius. A life thus devoted\r\nwill afford more real gratification to an uncorrupted mind, than\r\nvoluptuousness, with all her allurement, can offer, or than\r\nintemperance, with her bacchanalian crew, has power to bestow. We\r\nmay indeed almost venture to assert, that if pure and rational\r\nhappiness is any where to be found, except in the temples of\r\nreligion, she resides in the studies of the learned, and sweetens\r\nall their labours. The cultivation of a literary taste is the\r\nsource of rational and innocent entertainment; it is a powerful\r\npreservative from vice, and contributes to exercise in the soul a\r\nlove of virtue. The pleasures of sense are all transitory in their\r\nnature, and have a direct tendency to debase the mind; while on the\r\ncontrary, intellectual pursuits, delight us the more we are engaged\r\nin them, and even when their novelty is worn off, they still retain\r\ntheir charms. From the first period in which man is endowed with\r\nthe use of his reasoning faculties, there is a constant struggle\r\nbetween the animal and intellectual powers. These endeavour to raise\r\nman to a state of immortal felicity, those, to sink and degrade him\r\nto a level with the brutes. Whatever pleasures, therefore, tend to\r\nincrease the predominance of reason over the sensual desires, are\r\nfavourable to the interests of virtue and religion. The pleasures\r\nof literature are of this nature; they strengthen and invigorate\r\nthe faculties of the mind, and render it capable of manly exertion;\r\nthey inspire cheerfulness and serenity, and produce an exquisite\r\ngratification to the mental powers; in short, they are as much\r\nsuperior to any thing of a sensual nature, as the nature of the\r\nhuman soul is superior to that of the body.\r\n\r\n  W. M.\r\n  Jan. 4th, 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy from the original of a letter written by\r\nDr. Franklin, and never before published. As the subject is one,\r\ninvested at the present moment, with considerable interest to the\r\npeople of this country, and coming from the pen of a celebrated man,\r\nwhose patriotism, it is believed, was never doubted, it may perhaps\r\nbe acceptable to your readers, and worthy of preservation in the\r\npages of the _Rural Magazine_. Whether the Doctor is right or wrong\r\nin his theory, the public will determine.\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n\r\n  _\"London, Feb. 20, 1768._\r\n\r\n\"DEAR FRIEND.--I wrote to you a few lines by Capt. Falconer, and\r\nI sent you Dr. Watson's new piece, of experiments in inoculation,\r\nwhich I hope will be agreeable to you.\r\n\r\n\"The Boston people pretending to interfere with the manufactures\r\nof this country, make a great clamour here against America in\r\ngeneral. I have endeavoured, therefore, to palliate matters a\r\nlittle in several public papers. It would, as you justly observe,\r\ngive less umbrage if we meddled only with such manufactures as\r\nEngland does not attend to. That of linen might be carried on\r\nmore or less in every family, (perhaps it can only do in a family\r\nway) and silk I think in most of the colonies. But there are many\r\nmanufactures that we cannot carry on to advantage, though we\r\nwere at entire liberty. And after all, this country is fond of\r\nmanufactures beyond their real value: _for the true source of riches\r\nis husbandry_. Agriculture is truly _productive of new wealth_;\r\nmanufacturers only change forms; and whatever value they give to\r\nthe materials they work upon, they in the meantime consume an\r\nequal value in provisions, &c.; so that riches are not _increased_\r\nby manufacturing; the only advantage is, that provisions in the\r\nshape of manufactures, are more easily carried for sale to foreign\r\nmarkets, and where the provisions cannot be easily carried to\r\nmarket, 'tis well so to transform them for our own use as well as\r\nforeign sale. In families also, where the children and servants\r\nof farmers have some spare time, 'tis well to employ it in making\r\nsomething; and in spinning, or knitting, &c. to _gather up the\r\nfragments_ of time, _that nothing be lost_; for these fragments\r\nthough small in themselves, amount to something great in the year,\r\nand the family must eat whether they work or are idle. But this\r\nnation seems to have increased the number of its manufactures beyond\r\nreasonable bounds, (for there are bounds to every thing,) whereby\r\nprovisions are now risen to an exorbitant price by the demand for\r\nsupplying home mouths; so that there must be an importation from\r\nforeign countries: but the expense of bringing provisions from\r\nabroad to feed manufacturers here, will so enhance the price of the\r\nmanufactures, that they may be made cheaper where the provisions\r\ngrow, and the mouths will go to the meat.\r\n\r\n\"With many thanks for your good wishes, I am, dear friend,\r\naffectionately yours,\r\n\r\n  B. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n  \"DR. CADWALLADER EVANS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE DESULTORY REMARKER.--No. I.\r\n\r\n      At lucre or renown let others aim,\r\n      I only wish to please the gentle mind,\r\n    Whom Nature's charms inspire, and lore of humankind.\r\n\r\n    _Beattie._\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no nation existing, amongst whom there is so large\r\na proportion of readers, as may be found in the United States. The\r\nfreedom of our form of government, and its appropriate concomitant,\r\nthe freedom of the press, impart the requisite facilities for a wide\r\ndissemination of knowledge, and furnish the motives and the means\r\nfor cultivating it with success. Of newspapers, we have, if not\r\na redundant, at least a copious supply. They are introduced into\r\nalmost every nook and by-place of our extensive territory; and no\r\nindividual who can read, need deny himself the gratification, of\r\nporing over their pages, and learnedly descanting on their contents.\r\nThe moral influence of these popular vehicles of intelligence,\r\nmay therefore from these facts, be properly estimated, and the\r\nimportance of their being judiciously conducted, will at once be\r\nacknowledged. It is not the ponderous volume, the learned and\r\nelaborate dissertation, the abstruse researches of the ontologist,\r\nthat moulds the sentiments of the great mass of any people, and\r\nimplants in their bosoms the every-day principles of action; for\r\nto these they are utter strangers, and the laborious student may\r\ncontinue to monopolize them, without exciting in their minds the\r\nslightest regret: that however, which is brief, and simple, and\r\npractical, in other words, that which will be _generally read_,\r\ncannot fail to produce a deep and lasting impression on the public\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nWith these convictions on the subject, it is contemplated, as\r\nleisure and inclination may suggest, to furnish a series of\r\noccasional papers, under the title indicated above. The plan of\r\nthe writer, like those of his illustrious predecessors, is broad\r\nand liberal; unencumbered by systematic restraint; he intends to\r\nramble over hill and dale, to seek for admission, not only at the\r\ncottage, but also at the mansion of opulence; and no topic shall be\r\nexcluded calculated to promote general utility. To liberalise the\r\npublic sentiment, to enlighten the public mind, in fine, to _make\r\nmen better_, and by a necessary consequence, to promote public and\r\nprivate happiness, shall be his cardinal and favourite object. Human\r\nlife and its incidents, men and things, literature and morals,\r\nwill all be kept in view; and facts and illustrations, which may\r\nbe subservient to his purpose, whether derived from observation or\r\nreflection, from society or from books, will not be forgotten or\r\ndisregarded. Of the negative qualities of his proposed papers, he\r\ncan speak without reserve and with entire confidence; they shall\r\nnever offend the eye or ear of delicacy or of virtue. Immediate and\r\npersonal observation, is entitled to a decided preference where\r\nit is possible to be consulted; but to him, the extent of whose\r\nmigrations have been merely \"from the blue bed to the brown,\" this\r\nis a resource which will often fail. Distant countries and former\r\nperiods of time will therefore be contemplated, to use a significant\r\nphrase of Dryden, \"through the spectacles of books.\" By thus\r\ncultivating an acquaintance with the generations which are past,\r\nand by thus holding converse with the mighty dead, we may augment\r\nthe power of useful information, fortify our good principles, and\r\nbecome better qualified to perform the respective duties assigned\r\nus in the world. Human nature continues to travel onward with her\r\nvenerable but untiring companion, Time, without the least change of\r\ncharacter. Every feature, which appertained to her, six thousand\r\nyears ago, will still be recognized by the discerning observer. It\r\nis, therefore, extremely desirable, that experience should not be\r\nlost upon us; but that her beacons should serve as a polar star, by\r\nwhich to steer our course with safety, through the dangerous and\r\nperplexing labyrinths of life.\r\n\r\nThere is no question, that the very essence of papers, which shall\r\nsuccessfully prefer claims to popular favour, or to practical\r\nutility, _must be variety_. The strength of Johnson himself could\r\nnot shield his great moral work from the charge of unvaried and\r\nmonotonous solemnity. He inculcated the doctrine, and exemplified it\r\nby his own writings, that even \"uniformity of excellence\" will at\r\nlength nauseate the palate, not merely of the fastidious reader, but\r\nof him likewise whose only object is truth.\r\n\r\nA prominent purpose will be attained, if the dominion of fashionable\r\nfolly shall be narrowed, and the attention of her votaries withdrawn\r\nfrom the frivolous and giddy circles in which they revolve; and\r\nsteadfastly directed to the great interests of society, the cause of\r\nsound morals and unsophisticated virtue. Is it not a fact calculated\r\nto awaken the most profound regret, that many of our fellow\r\ncitizens, particularly in the wealthy metropolis of Pennsylvania,\r\nwho are invested with an elevated rank in life, and enjoy in\r\nprofusion its good things, appear to live only for themselves? Men\r\nof this description, are really blanks in existence; and mistake\r\nmost egregiously, the great errand of life. They may appropriately\r\nadopt the language of Pomfret:\r\n\r\n    Custom the world's great idol we adore;\r\n    And knowing this, we seek to know no more.\r\n    Now education more than truth prevails,\r\n    And naught is current but what custom seals.\r\n    Thus from the time we first began to know,\r\n    We live and learn, but not the wiser grow.\r\n\r\nAlthough sometimes assuming the province of a censor, the _Desultory\r\nRemarker_ will on all proper occasions, delight to unbend the stern\r\nand rigid brow of reproof, to mingle in the circles of innocent\r\nmirth and cheerfulness. He who increases the stock of \"harmless\r\npleasure,\" makes the public his debtor; but in order to ascertain\r\nthat such is the character of pleasure, the requisite tests must be\r\nfaithfully and rigorously applied. Cheerfulness uniformly shuns all\r\nintercourse with vice, but virtue is her favourite and appropriate\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n    The innocent are gay--the lark is gay,\r\n    That dries his feathers, saturate with dew,\r\n    Beneath the rosy cloud, while yet the beams\r\n    Of day-spring overshoot his humble nest.\r\n\r\nThe _Desultory Remarker_ having thus in a spirit at once unreserved\r\nand candid, introduced himself to the reader will for the present\r\nrespectfully take his leave; but with the hope of having other\r\nopportunities of cultivating a further acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n_Letters of a Citizen to his Friends in the Country._\r\n\r\nNo. II.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy own observation, and the opinions of others, induce me to\r\nbelieve, that generally speaking, less attention is given to\r\n_education_ among the farmers of Pennsylvania than was the case\r\nhalf a century ago. At any rate, the opportunity for instruction\r\nwithin the last fifty years, has not kept pace with the increased\r\nability to furnish it.\r\n\r\nLand has appreciated, and the productions of the soil have yielded\r\ngreat profits to the husbandman; but the intellectual harvest has\r\nbeen of little account. The habits and manners of each successive\r\ngeneration, display the avidity with which foreign customs and\r\nfashions are embraced by the yeomanry of the country, but these\r\n_outside_ evidences of what is called _refinement_, have added\r\nnothing to the stock of our mental resources, and greatness. My\r\npurpose however, is to suggest plans of improvement, rather than\r\nto find fault with existing errors, for I am convinced that if a\r\nliberal and judicious system be adopted for enlarging the minds of\r\nour youth, and storing them with sound principles, the follies,\r\n(perhaps the vices,) which now so much engross their attention,\r\ndisfigure their character, and mar their usefulness, would be\r\nultimately corrected. Scholastic learning _alone_ will not, I am\r\nfully satisfied, mend the heart, or sanctify the understanding; but\r\nI am equally sure, that _ignorance as a quality_, never contributed\r\nto render the mind over which it held a dark and dreary reign, in a\r\ngreater degree susceptible of those benign views, and exalted aims,\r\nwhich give to the _accountable being_, a just conception of the\r\ndesign of his Creator.\r\n\r\nIf my opinion be worth any thing, of which you must be the judges, I\r\nwould recommend the establishment of schools in every neighbourhood;\r\nbut upon a very different foundation from that which generally\r\nobtains. Instead of an itinerant schoolmaster, who goes forth in the\r\nlatter part of autumn in search of subsistence through the winter\r\nmonths, often without qualifications for the task he solicits, and\r\nnot unfrequently of equivocal moral reputation, select a teacher\r\nestimable for his private virtues as a man, and respectable for\r\nhis literary and scientific acquirements; remunerate him with a\r\nliberal salary; erect a suitable and comfortable building for the\r\naccommodation of the school: supply it with maps, globes, &c., and\r\ncommence a library of useful books. Send your children regularly\r\nto school throughout the year, and thus make their education as\r\nmuch a business, and duty, as the cultivation of your farms. Short\r\nof this, will not fulfil the obligations which every parent owes\r\nto his offspring. We are social beings, and our prosperity and\r\nhappiness depend primarily upon ourselves, and secondarily upon\r\nothers; so that we are advancing our own interests and comforts,\r\nwhen we promote that of those by whom we are surrounded. In every\r\nneighbourhood in the country there are a few individuals whose\r\npecuniary means will not permit them to defray the expenses of\r\neducation, which the more wealthy can afford, and the condition\r\nof the indigent has been seriously affected in this respect,\r\nby the institution of _boarding schools_. To those seminaries,\r\nthe children of the affluent are sent; the common schools are\r\nconsequently neglected; the poor go uninstructed, and a wide, and\r\nfatal distinction is thus created, among the inhabitants of the\r\nsame vicinage. Rather, fellow citizens, than perpetuate this sort\r\nof classification in society, direct your attention to the formation\r\nof good schools at home, to which every child may be admitted; where\r\nall may partake of the same common benefits and blessings. You will\r\nthus place all on a par in the advantages of instruction, create in\r\nthe minds of all, the same respect for those moral obligations which\r\nhold the community together in the bond of safety and peace, and\r\nconfer upon your offspring the most solid security.\r\n\r\nA youth, the son of one who is competent to defray the expense of\r\nhis education at a boarding school, or college, is sent from home\r\nat the age of sixteen; is absent three or four years; has formed\r\nnew associations, and contracted new notions; he returns to his\r\nbirth-place; he has outgrown the recollections, and intimacies of\r\nhis childhood; he feels a sort of elevation above the children of\r\nhis neighbourhood, who have been groping in ignorance during his\r\nabsence; he stands aloof; jealousy takes hold on the minds of those\r\nwho observe this difference, and every evil passion begins its\r\noperation; the consequences are as sad, as they are certain.\r\n\r\nContemplate the reverse of the picture. Behold the youth of\r\nadjoining farms for several miles in circumference, collected\r\ntogether in one school; pursuing the same studies; partaking of the\r\nsame general care, in a moral and religious point of view, which\r\nevery conscientious teacher will find it his pleasure to extend\r\ntoward his pupils; participating in the same innocent recreations;\r\ngrowing up together with similar views of private duty, and public\r\nobligation; witness such an instance as this, and you may be assured\r\nthat from hence will proceed much which will dignify and adorn the\r\nlocality, where it is found to exist.\r\n\r\nAs these reflections have occurred to me, I have taken the freedom\r\nof presenting them to your consideration. I am influenced by no\r\nother motive than that which would induce me to be the humblest\r\nagent in promoting the true interests of our country, and enlarging,\r\nif it were in my power, the circle of human happiness.\r\n\r\n  CIVIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nHISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any thing which is more injurious to the\r\nmind, or which will more effectually prevent the acquisition of\r\nknowledge, than a habit of reading for amusement only.--For, it\r\nwill necessarily happen, that impressions, which have not been\r\nstrengthened by reflection, will be quickly obliterated; and we\r\ncannot expect to derive permanent advantage from the mere pursuit of\r\ntemporary enjoyment.\r\n\r\nTo obviate the effects of a practice so pernicious, and to accustom\r\nthe mind to the investigation of causes, the study of history\r\nis peculiarly adapted, for while it furnishes to the reflecting\r\nmind, ample room for the exercise of its powers, it is in itself,\r\nsufficiently attractive, to engage the attention of the most\r\ncareless reader, it is indeed delightful, to\r\n\r\n      --------------------------\"Steal\r\n    From all we may be, or have been before;\r\n\r\nto associate with men, upon whom a world has gazed with fear and\r\nwonder, to mingle in the conflicts Of nations, and to dwell upon the\r\nrestlessness of ambition, the fearless perseverence of patriotism:\r\nnor is it less instructive to mark the gradual unfoldings of\r\nvirtuous or vicious propensities, and to observe how frequently\r\nthe sacrifice of all the enjoyments of life to the attainment of\r\nsome favourite objects has been rewarded, with the hopeless gloom\r\nattendant upon satiety. History may thus be said to convey to us the\r\nexperience of ages; and he must be an indifferent or a prejudiced\r\nobserver, who cannot find his own feelings portrayed in the motives\r\nwhich it developes.\r\n\r\nBut, with whatever views we may have undertaken this important\r\nstudy, we shall find it fruitless of permanent benefit, unless\r\nwe shall have been impressed with the conviction of the absolute\r\nnecessity of examining into the evidence of facts, and the\r\ncorrectness of deductions. It is thus only that we can be preserved\r\nfrom the danger of imbibing erroneous opinions on subjects affecting\r\nthe common prejudices of mankind, or the peculiar doctrines of our\r\nauthors. It is this assumption of popular sentiments which has\r\ndegraded the human character, and reduced the highest intellectual\r\npowers to a dependence upon the lowest; and it is this reliance upon\r\nthe impartiality of the historian, which has lent its assistance\r\nto the speculations of a false philosophy, in leading men into all\r\nthe wanderings of scepticism. Let the student of history who is in\r\npursuit of truth, endeavour to acquaint himself with the private\r\nopinions of the author whom he has taken for his guide, and let\r\nhim beware, lest he admit any conclusion, however unimportant,\r\nwhich may seem to be at variance with the dictates of reason\r\nor of experience. Two important ends will thus be attained. By\r\nestablishing a connection between the events detailed in history,\r\nand the reasonings founded upon them, they will be more likely to be\r\nretained in the memory; and by convincing himself of the fallacies\r\nin the arguments of its opponents, the reality of any truth will be\r\nmore deeply impressed upon the mind. He who is thus habituated to\r\nscrutiny, will derive instruction from the errors of those with whom\r\nhe is conversant; and may be compared (to borrow from the beautiful\r\nsimile of bishop Horne,) to those who visit the country in spring,\r\nfor whom \"the very hedges are in bloom, and every thorn produces a a\r\nflower.\"\r\n\r\n  C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract of a letter from the late President\r\nAdams, to a friend of the editors. Any thing from the pen of this\r\neminent and venerable man will be read with interest, and ought to\r\nbe public property. The anecdote is characteristic, and the obvious\r\nmoral influence to be deduced from it, will strike the mind of every\r\nattentive reader.\r\n\r\n  _Quincy, January_ 12th, 1820.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR.--I thank you for your New-Year's letter, &c. * * * * As\r\nagriculture is the nursing mother of us all, it cannot be too\r\nassiduously cultivated; nor is it likely to be too much honoured,\r\nwhile mercantile profits are so much greater, and military glory is\r\nesteemed the highest glory!\r\n\r\nThe \"American\"[1] is an able writer; but I wish he had avoided\r\nso many appearances of endeavouring to justify, or at least to\r\napologize for slavery in general. His arguments _ad hominem_ from\r\nthe Bible, reminded me of an anecdote, which as I am an old man, and\r\nas old age has a privilege to be talkative and narrative, I will\r\nattempt to relate: In the winter of '76, Mr. Paine's Common Sense\r\nand my Thoughts on Government, made their appearance in public, the\r\none not long after the other. Common Sense recommended the Thoughts\r\non Government; an organization in three distinct departments, as\r\nindependent of each other as human beings can be;--the legislature\r\nto consist of three branches. Mr. Paine came flying to my apartment,\r\nto reproach me for publishing a monarchico, aristicratico,\r\ndemocratico system. He scolded violently, but I soothed him down by\r\nlaughing at him in my turn. Paine, said I, how could you be such an\r\nabominable hypocrite, as to pretend to prove in your Common Sense\r\nfrom the Old Testament, that monarchy was not lawful by the word of\r\nGOD? This struck him dumb for a moment, but recovering himself, and\r\nshrugging his shoulders, and laughing, said, with great contempt; \"I\r\nbelieve nothing of the Old Testament, nor the New neither;\" and then\r\npausing, said, \"I have had thoughts of publishing my opinions upon\r\nreligion, but upon the whole I have concluded to put _it_ off till\r\nthe latter part of my life.\" This plan he consistently pursued.\r\n\r\n  [1] The author of a long letter to the \"Edinburgh Reviewers,\"\r\n  published in the National Intelligencer.\r\n\r\nI am not sorry his bones are gone to England, to moulder in the soil\r\nwhere they grew; for I claim neither to myself or to my country, any\r\nhonour from having once supported them.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your obliged friend, and humble servant,\r\n\r\n  JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILIAR LETTERS\r\n\r\n_From an Englishman in this country to his Friend at home._\r\n\r\n(Communicated for the Rural Magazine.)\r\n\r\nNo. II.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Philada. Sept. 16, 1819._\r\n\r\n  My Dear G.\r\n\r\nYou know how very apt persons are to form an opinion of other\r\npersons with whom accident or design makes them acquainted, either\r\non the _very_ wise principles of Lavater, or the _still wiser_\r\nprinciples of Doctor--what's his name--(I wish I could forget as\r\neasily the labour I lost in studying him)--who first conceived\r\ncraniology. You know also that I had every predisposition to\r\nthe study of both these abstruse sciences, and the consequent\r\ndeductions; so you will not be much surprised when I tell you that I\r\nhave employed the time that has elapsed since the date of my last,\r\nin observing the physiognomy of Philadelphia. I did this, before\r\nI trespassed on the good-will, the hospitality, or the politeness\r\nof any of its citizens. You will observe I am perfectly distinct\r\nin my classification, and I beg of you to remember this, when you\r\nperuse any of my rambling epistles hereafter. My letters would, I\r\nhope, have commanded the civil attention of any person to whom they\r\nwere addressed, independent of any particular kindness to which the\r\nrecommendation of our venerable Quaker friend D---- of London would\r\non the principle of reciprocity entitle me. But before I penetrated\r\nlike Asmodeus in \"Le Diable Boiteaux,\" into the domestic circle,\r\nthe parlour, the halls, the tables, or the toilettes, or (shall I\r\nsay it) to the counter and the desk. I wished to see the roofs, at\r\nleast, if I could not see through them. So for the last week I have\r\nbeen studying physiognomies. There can be no need of apology to you\r\nmy friend, who, (Heaven be praised) have never had occasion to leave\r\nthe precincts of your ancient patrimony for any thing but pleasure,\r\nfor dilating on a city that so far as it regards myself, has\r\nhitherto been on a par with Herculaneum or Pompeia. Some manuscripts\r\nand some printed accounts I _have_ seen, but like those saved from\r\nthe lava of Vesuvius, they were hardly worth unfolding. Indeed, I\r\nalways pitied poor Sir Humphrey for so incomprehensible a task. He\r\nhad better have staid at home, and made experiments in separating\r\nthe brick and mortar from the old ruins lord L---- boasts of having\r\nbeen in his family, at the smallest calculation from William Rufus.\r\nI do wonder what it could have been that the ancients took such care\r\nof.\r\n\r\nWell--I have _seen_ Philadelphia.--And if it were not for the dull\r\nmonotony of its right angles--the wide streets that throw such an\r\nimmense space between your lodgings and any desired object--the want\r\nof all the cries I have been used to in all the popular cities I\r\nhave frequented, except, indeed, the solitary halloo of a _sweep_,\r\n(and then only before one gets up in a morning) and the everlasting\r\n_gong_ that wakes me from my sweetest slumber, and dreams of home,\r\nwith all its indefinable attractions, I would say that Philadelphia\r\nwas a very decent, orderly, well arranged, and handsome city. But\r\ngive me Hogarth's line of beauty; I hate your everlasting parallels\r\nthat run together to infinity, and never unite. By the way I am told\r\nthat I shall be amply gratified in this respect in New York and\r\nBoston. There is only one street in this city, called Dock street,\r\nthat is entitled to any claim to my fancy; and that is too broad,\r\nand nobody lives in it--all shops and warehouses.\r\n\r\nThe weather is remarkably fine,--every body complains of a want\r\nof rain:--for my part I must confess I had enough at home; and if\r\nI must find fault with the climate, it is too hot. Yet I do not\r\nfind the lassitude I expected, consequent on exercise in the open\r\nair. Notwithstanding a mid-day sun, that in England we should\r\nhave thought intolerable, a young gentleman with whom I formed an\r\nacquaintance at our excellent hotel, prevailed upon me to take\r\na promenade along the Philadelphia Bond street, which here is\r\ndenominated Chesnut street. We saw some mansions that would not have\r\ndisgraced one of our fashionable squares;--some ladies that would\r\nhave honoured the very first equipage that sports in Hyde Park. Only\r\na few could boast of our Saxon complexion; but their forms were cast\r\nin a superior mould;--this I apprehend is aboriginal--and although\r\nI cannot learn that any are willing to acknowledge their derivation\r\nfrom the native Indians, several circumstances induce me to believe\r\nthere has been a greater mixture with the first occupants of this\r\nvast continent than has been generally supposed. But more of this\r\nhereafter--if in my contemplated visit next summer to the falls of\r\nNiagara, I should meet with some of the _deer_ skinned heroes and\r\nheroines of this western hemisphere. I have laid all those of the\r\nsock and buskin on the shelf, and am enthusiast enough to expect\r\nperfection among the savages of North America. Why should I not?\r\nThrough all the obloquy that has been thrown upon them by their\r\nruthless despoilers,\r\n\r\n  \"More savage still than they,\"\r\n\r\nthrough all that inveteracy of feeling which those who injure\r\nuniversally entertain--and \"they who injure never pardon,\" you may\r\nstill find a confession, or rather an admission of their virtues\r\nand their talents, of their magnanimity of character, and their\r\nelevation of soul. Not merely that indifference to privation and\r\nbodily suffering which we have been taught, was characteristic of\r\nsavage life, but in spite of the natural principle of retaliation\r\nand revenge, (and I will maintain that it is a natural principle)\r\nthey have evinced that virtue which the Bible has never taught many\r\nof us who have had access to it--_forgiveness of our enemies_.\r\n\r\nDo not, however, think that I have lost myself in the interminable\r\nforests which still remain to the original proprietors of this\r\ncontinent--or that I have assumed the rifle and the moccasin. I\r\nshould even prefer taking up my residence in this place which you\r\nknow we have always considered one of the advanced posts in the\r\nmarch of civilization. It is true I have not yet descended from the\r\nroofs as aforesaid, to see what kind of an animal a Philadelphian\r\nreally is in his own family circle, and shall have to defer a\r\npicture of this non-descript till opportunity of observation occurs.\r\nI have as yet seen only the outside. I have seen the Pennsylvania\r\nhospital externally; I have seen the figure of old William Penn\r\nstanding like a good old fashioned broad brimmed sentinel before\r\nthe door of the edifice, like all sentries exposed to the wind\r\nand the weather, with his head as it were drooping over the fine\r\nhot-house plants that surround him. But a bronze statue of the old\r\ngentleman I must confess seemed rather _outre_, although he richly\r\ndeserved an equipment in that same costume from the perseverance\r\nwhich history tells us he evinced in the strife with the bailiffs\r\nthat beset him in our old island. But let that pass; I would consent\r\nto be surrounded by tipstaves all my life to leave such a character\r\nas he did behind.--I have seen the Academy of Fine Arts, most\r\nmodestly retiring from public view, behind a range of buildings\r\nthat some of the cits have unconscionably erected on the front of\r\nthe street, thus clearly evincing their disposition, to use the\r\nwords of my Chesnut street friend, to throw the fine arts in the\r\n_back ground_. By the way the good people here are said to be (by\r\nthe New Yorkers at least) most intolerably given to _punning_, and\r\nI must admit that some of the gentlemen who attend our excellent\r\nordinary, have put off a few attempts at that vile species of wit,\r\nof a most contemptible character. I should, however, be very sorry\r\nto pass an opinion on the whole genus by the few specimens I have\r\nseen. Philadelphia is really a very handsome city; yet to take a\r\npanoramic view of it, _you_ would be exceedingly disappointed. There\r\nare no steeples, or rather there is _one_, and that a very decent\r\none--the architecture of which is by no means contemptible; but then\r\nthere is _but one_ steeple in a city of upwards of fifteen thousand\r\nhouses, principally constructed of brick. If there were only a\r\nstandard or ensign appended to its spire, which is about 200 feet\r\nfrom the ground, and that standard in proportion to its height, this\r\ngoodly town would look like one grand encampment. Few of the houses\r\nexceed three stories, of about ten or twelve feet each. The city is\r\nhowever, flanked by two shot towers, one in the southeast, the other\r\nin the northwestern extremity; which afford some relief to the dead\r\nuniformity in the general aspect of the town. How successful the\r\nproprietors of these said towers may have been in the pursuit of\r\ntheir vocation, I know not; but for ornament to this place, I would\r\nnot give one steeple, like that which is bottomed in the good old\r\ndiocesan episcopal church for a thousand of them.\r\n\r\nYou see I have obeyed the injunction laid on me at parting, to\r\nexpress every thing as it presented itself to my observation, but in\r\nnothing can you find more sincerity of feeling than when I assure\r\nyou neither time nor distance has diminished the warmth of affection\r\nwith which I continue to be your friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Treatise on Agriculture._\r\n\r\nSECT. II.\r\n\r\nOf the actual state of Agriculture in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is very different in different states, and even in different\r\nparts of the same state; its greater or less degree of perfection,\r\ndepending on causes physical, or political, or both. Where a\r\nstate, or part of a state, from _soil_, _climate_, _manners_, or\r\n_geographical position_, draws its principal subsistence from the\r\nfishery or the chase, as in the more northern parts of Europe,\r\nagriculture will not succeed; when a state is from any cause both\r\nessentially maritime or manufacturing, as in England, or principally\r\nmanufacturing, as in Prussia; where public opinion has degraded\r\nmanual labour, as in Spain, Portugal, and the Papal territory; or\r\nwhere laws villainize it, as in Russia, Prussia, Poland, Hungary,\r\n&c. &c. it is in vain to expect pre-eminent agriculture.--These\r\nprinciples will receive illustration as we go along.\r\n\r\n1. In the Campania of Rome, where in the time of Pliny were counted\r\ntwenty-three cities, the traveller is now astonished and depressed\r\nat the silence and desolation that surround him.--Even from Rome\r\nto Trescati, (four leagues of road the most frequented) we find\r\nonly an arid plain, without trees, without meadows, natural or\r\nartificial, and without villages, or other habitation of man!\r\nYet is this wretchedness not the fault of soil or climate, which\r\n(with little alteration[2]) continue to be what they were in the\r\ndays of Augustus. \"_Man is the only growth that dwindles here_,\"\r\nand to his deficient or ill directed industry, are owing all the\r\ncalamities of the scene.[3] Instead of the hardy and masculine\r\nlabours of the field; the successors of Cato and of Pliny employ\r\nthemselves in fabricating _sacred vases, hair powders and pomatums,\r\nartificial pearls, fiddle strings, embroidered gloves, and religious\r\nrelics_! They are also great collectors of pictures, statues, and\r\nmedals--\"dirty gods and coins,\" and find an ample reward in the\r\nignorance and credulity of those who buy them.\r\n\r\n  [2] The climate of Italy is now warmer than it was in the Augustan\r\n  age, which Buffon ascribes to the draining of great tracts of swampy\r\n  lands in Germany.\r\n\r\n  [3] \"Un Romain meme le plus indigent rougiroit de cultiver la\r\n  terre.\" Bosc.\r\n\r\n2. How different from this picture is that of _Tuscany_! where\r\nthe soil, though less fertile,[4] is covered with grains, with\r\nvines, and with cattle; and where a surface of 1200 square\r\nleagues, subsists a population of nine hundred and fifty thousand\r\ninhabitants, of whom eighty thousand are agriculturists. It may\r\namuse, if it does not instruct, the reader, to offer a few details\r\nof a husbandry, among the most distinguished of the present age. The\r\nplough of the north of Europe, as of this country, has the powers of\r\na wedge, and acts perpendicularly; but that of Tuscany resembles a\r\nshovel, is eight or nine inches long, and nearly as broad, and cuts\r\nthe earth horizontally. This instrument is particularly adapted to\r\nthe loose and friable texture of the soil. A second plough, of the\r\nsame shape, but of smaller size, follows that already described, and\r\nwith the aid of the hoe and the spade,[5] throws the earth, already\r\nbroken and pulverised, into four feet ridges, or beds, on which the\r\ncrop is sown. The furrows answer a threefold purpose; they drain the\r\nbeds of excessive moisture, ventilate the growing crops, and supply\r\npaths for the weeders.\r\n\r\n  [4] \"Two thirds of Tuscany consist of mountains.\" Vol. viii. p. 232.\r\n  _Geographic, Mathematique et Phisique_: See also Forsyth's remarks,\r\n  p. 80, where are detailed the principal causes of her prosperity.\r\n  \"Leopold,\" says he, \"in selling the crown lands, studiously _divided\r\n  large tracts_ of rich but neglected land, into _small properties_.\r\n  His favourite plan of encouraging agriculture consisted, not in\r\n  _boards_, _societies_, and _premiums_, but in giving _the labourer\r\n  a security and interest in the soil_--in multiplying small\r\n  freeholders--in extending the livelli, or life leases, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n  [5] It is among the most important covenants of a Tuscan lease, that\r\n  one third of the ground be annually worked with a spade.\r\n\r\nThe _rotation of crops_, employs two periods of different length;\r\nthe one of three, the other of five years. In the rotation of\r\n_three_ years, the ground is sown five times, and in that of four\r\nyears, seven times, as follows.\r\n\r\nFirst year, wheat, and after wheat lupins.\r\n\r\nSecond year wheat, and after wheat turnips.\r\n\r\nThird year, Indian corn or millet.\r\n\r\nFirst year, wheat, and after wheat beans.\r\n\r\nSecond year, wheat, and after wheat lupins.\r\n\r\nThird year, wheat, and after wheat lupinella: (annual clover.)\r\n\r\nFourth year, Indian corn, or millet.\r\n\r\nIn the _Syanese Maremna_, where the lands want neither repose or\r\nmanure, the constant alternation is _hemp_ and _wheat_, and the\r\nproduce of the latter, often twenty-four bushels threshed, for one\r\nsown.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this course of crops, that the principal\r\nobject of Tuscan agriculture, is wheat, of which they have two\r\nspecies, the one bald, the other bearded; both larger than the\r\ncorresponding species in other countries of Europe; convertible\r\ninto excellent bread and pastes, and probably but varieties of that\r\n_Sicilian family_, which Pliny describes, as yielding \"_most flour_\r\nand _least bran_, and _suffering no degradation from time_.\" It\r\nis harvested about the middle of June and when the grain crop is\r\nsecured, the ploughing for the second, or forage crop, begins; which\r\nbesides lupins, lupinella, and beans, often consists of a mixture of\r\nlupins, turnips, and flax. The lupins ripen first and are gathered\r\nin autumn; the turnips are drawn in the winter and the flax in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nBesides the application of _ordinary manures_, the lupin is ploughed\r\ndown, _when in flower_; a practice that began with the Romans:\r\nColumella says, \"of all leguminous vegetables, the _lupin_ is\r\nthat which most merits attention, because it costs least, employs\r\nleast time and furnishes an _excellent manure_.\" The culture of\r\nthis vegetable is different, according to the purposes for which\r\nit is raised; if for grain, the ground has two ploughings and\r\ntwenty-five pounds weight of seed to a square of a hundred toises:\r\nif for manure, one ploughing is sufficient. Like our buckwheat,\r\nits vegetation is quick and its growth rapid; whence the farther\r\nadvantage of suppressing, and even of destroying the weeds that\r\nwould have infested any other crop. In the neighbourhood of\r\nFlorence, they are in the practice of _burning the soil_; which they\r\ndo by digging holes, filling them with faggots and raising the earth\r\ninto mounds over them.--The faggots are then inflamed and burnt, and\r\nwith them the incumbent earth, which is afterwards scattered, so as\r\nto give the whole field the same preparation.\r\n\r\n3d. \"The countries,\" says Arthur Young, \"the most rich and\r\nflourishing of Europe, in proportion to their extent, are probably\r\n_Piedmont_ and the _Milanese_. We there meet all the signs of\r\nprosperity--an active and well conditioned population, great\r\nexportations, considerable interior consumption, superb roads, many\r\nopulent towns, a ready and abundant circulation, the interest of\r\nmoney low, the price of labour high; in one word, it is impossible\r\nto cite a single fact that shews that Manchester, Birmingham, Rouen,\r\nand Lyons, are in a condition equally prosperous, as the whole of\r\nthese Dutchies.\" Their population is stated at \"1,114,000, and the\r\nterritory at little more than two millions of arpents, (acres.)\r\nWheat, rye, indian corn, flax and hemp, the vine and the olive,\r\nthe caper and the cotton tree, with all kinds of garden fruits and\r\nvegetables, are cultivated here: the soil knows no repose, and much\r\nof it yields annually and uniformly two crops of grain, or three\r\nof grass.\"[6] These are the miracles of irrigation; not a drop of\r\nwater is lost. Besides the permanent supplies furnished from lakes,\r\nponds, rivers, creeks and springs, even the winter torrent and\r\nsummer shower, are every where intercepted by drains, and led to\r\nreservoirs; whence they are distributed at will to the neighbouring\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\n  [6] Geographic, Mathematique, &c. Article Italie.\r\n\r\nIn 1770, an agricultural school was established at Milan, consisting\r\nof 220 boys, who were instructed in theoretical and practical\r\nhusbandry.--This institution has escaped the notice of travellers;\r\nand we are unable to say whether it has or has not, fulfilled the\r\nintentions of its projectors.\r\n\r\n4. _Switzerland_ has about 1444 square leagues of surface, and\r\npresents an assemblage of mountains, one rising above another, until\r\nthe summits are lost in masses of snow and ice, which never melt.\r\nThis short description sufficiently indicates the character of both\r\nthe soil and the climate; yet unpropitious as these are, we find\r\na population of 1242 inhabitants to each square league! \"This is\r\nperhaps the country of the world, which presents the most happy\r\neffects of an industry always active and persevering. The traveller\r\nwho climbs her mountains, is struck with admiration when he beholds\r\nvineyards and rich pastures in those places, which before appeared\r\nnaked and barren rocks. The traces of the plough are perceived on\r\nthe border of precipices, where the most savage animals do not pass\r\nwithout danger; in one word the inhabitants appear to have conquered\r\nall obstacles, whether arising from soil, position or climate and\r\nto have drawn abundance from territory, condemned by nature to\r\nperpetual sterility.\"[7]\r\n\r\n  [7] Idem. Article Helvetia.\r\n\r\n5. The classical reader will remember, that _Spain_ was the garden\r\nof the Hesperides of the Roman writers; by which was meant the\r\ncombinations of a fine climate, a rich soil and an active and\r\nintelligent agriculture. To this state of things, even the empire of\r\nthe Goths was not fatal,[8] and that of the Moors rendered it still\r\nmore distinguished. In their hands, the plains of Valentia were\r\ncultivated throughout, with the utmost care and skill; and where\r\ntheir wheels, reservoirs, and drains of irrigation, yet remain, the\r\nsoil continues to yield the richest and most abundant products.\r\nIn Catalonia, Navarre, Galitia and the Austurias, many species of\r\nthe ancient agriculture are yet in vigour, because \"the _leases\r\nare long_, and the _landlord cannot capriciously violate them_.\"\r\nThe same causes are followed by the same effects, in the three\r\ndistricts of Biscaya, Guiposcoa and Alava. \"In running over these,\r\nevery thing one finds is animated by the presence of liberty and\r\nindustry; nothing can be more charming than the coasts, nothing more\r\nattractive than the culture of the vallies. Throughout the thirty\r\nleagues that separate Bedassod from Vittoria, every quarter of an\r\nhour we discover some well built village, or comfortable cottage.\"[9]\r\n\r\n  [8] It appears from Varro _Dere rustica_ and the letters of\r\n  Cassiodorus, that the Goths introduced into Spain the subterranean\r\n  granaries, called _Siilos_, and the _art of irrigation_. The former\r\n  are now exclusively used in Tuscany, and Cato's precept, 'Prata\r\n  irrigua,' &c. shews whence their knowledge of the latter was derived.\r\n\r\n  [9] Burgoing's modern Spain, vol. i.\r\n\r\nHow different is the aspect of the other provinces! In these, not\r\nmore than two thirds of the earth are cultivated; and \"it is not\r\nuncommon to travel eight and ten leagues together, without finding\r\na trace of human industry. In the district of Badejoz alone, is a\r\ndesert of twenty-six leagues in length and twelve in breadth.[10]\r\nTen of the fourteen leagues that traverse the duchy of Medina\r\nSidonia, consist altogether of pasturage. There is no where a\r\nvestige of man; not an orchard, not a garden, not a ditch, not a\r\ncottage to be seen! The great proprietor appears to reign, like the\r\nlion in the desert, repulsing by his roaring all who would approach\r\nhim. But, instead of human colonies, we encounter troops of horned\r\ncattle and of _mares_, wandering, self directed, over plains, to\r\nwhich the eye can discover no boundary or barrier, and which brings\r\nto one's recollection the days when the beasts shared with man the\r\nempire of the earth.\"[11]\r\n\r\n  [10] Borde's Hineraira de l'Espagne, vol. iv. p. 30.\r\n\r\n  [11] Burgoing. Spain has been long renowned for its horses. The\r\n  Romans, in settling their pedigree and illustrating their swiftness,\r\n  called them '_the children of the winds_.'\r\n\r\n\"Even when the plough is used, it is little more than a great knife\r\nfastened to a stick, that just scratches the surface. The grain is\r\nthreshed by horses, or mules driven over it, of by means of a plank\r\nstudded with nails or flint stones and drawn across it. With even\r\nthis miserable culture, the land in Andalusia yields considerable\r\ncrops; yet are the inhabitants too lazy or too few to gather them\r\ntogether. This is done by Galiegos, who are the labourers of Spain.\"\r\nWe need scarcely remark, that in a state of agriculture like this,\r\nthe peasantry cannot be either well fed or well clothed. \"The\r\nmountaineers live principally upon roasted acorns and goats' milk,\r\nand those of the plain (from Barcelona to Malaga) on bread steeped\r\nwith oil, and occasionally seasoned with vinegar.\"[12]\r\n\r\n  [12] Swinburne's Travels, Vol. I. A Spanish peasant, who has earned\r\n  or begged enough for the wants of the day, will refuse to earn more,\r\n  even by running an errand. Striking as this fact is, it does not so\r\n  well illustrate Spanish indolence as the following anecdote from the\r\n  same pen. In the great sedition at Madrid, which ended in the defeat\r\n  of the king and the disgrace of his minister, (the Marquis des\r\n  Squillas) and in its most fervid moments, both parties retired about\r\n  dinner time to take their _nap_ or _meridiana_, after which they\r\n  returned to the combat with new vigour and enraged fury. If _habits_\r\n  can thus control the _passions_, to what important uses might not a\r\n  wise legislation turn them?\r\n\r\nIt is wide of our object to examine the causes of the degradation\r\nof character, which marks the agriculture of Spain. Well informed\r\nwriters have ascribed it to the expulsion of the Moors and Jews,\r\nto the weight of taxes and imposts, to the _mesta_ or common right\r\nof pasturage, to the discovery of America and its consequences,\r\nto the effect of climate and the ill judged charity of bishops\r\nand convents, but principally to the great _manorial grants_ and\r\n_unequal division_ of the soil, which followed the conquest. \"We\r\noften find six, eight, ten, and even fifteen leagues of extent\r\nbelonging to one master. The nobility and clergy possess nearly the\r\nwhole country. One third of Spain belongs to the families of Medina,\r\nCeli, D'Alva, De l'Infatado, D'Aceda, and to the archbishops,\r\nbishops and chapters of Toledo, Compostella, Valentia, Seville\r\nand Murcia. A great proportion of these lands remain untilled and\r\nuntenanted, and those which are let in _Cortijo_ or farms are double\r\nor treble the quantity that can be occupied in tillage.\"[13]\r\n\r\n  [13] Le Borde's Heneraire D'Espagne, Vol. 1.\r\n\r\n6. The agriculture of _Portugal_, has been subjected to the same\r\nevils as that of Spain, to which may be superadded, her connexion\r\nwith Great Britain; under whose policy she has become a raiser of\r\n_fruit_ instead of _grain_.\r\n\r\n7. _France_ is probably the country of Europe, which most unites\r\nthe great desiderata of an extended and profitable agriculture;\r\nfertility of soil, mildness of climate, a dense population, an\r\nenlightened government, and facility of exportation. Within her\r\nancient limits, she boasts of a surface of more than one hundred and\r\nfifteen millions of arpents, and a population of twenty-two millions\r\nof inhabitants. The following tables will shew, in a compressed\r\nform, the nature of her soil, and the use to which it is put.[14]\r\n\r\n  [14] See Geographique, &c. Vol. VI.

T. Those of manufacturing labour at\r\n  128,015,000.\r\n\r\n  [16] The effects of the revolution of 1789 on _agriculture_ are no\r\n  longer doubtful. The suppression of _tythes_--of the _exclusive\r\n  privilege_--of the _chase_--of every species of _corvee_ (labour\r\n  performed by tenants for landlords)--of _taxes_ or _rents_, and of\r\n  _rights_ of _commonage_--was among these effects; and if to these\r\n  we add the _division_ of the _great landed estates of the nobility\r\n  and clergy_, there can no longer be any scepticism on this point. No\r\n  truth is better established than the advantage of _small_ farms over\r\n  _great_, as far as the _public_ is concerned. The Roman latifundia\r\n  (military grants) destroyed Roman agriculture.\r\n\r\n1. A supposed resemblance between the earth and animals, gave rise\r\nto _fallows_; because men and horses required repose after _labour_,\r\nit was supposed that after _cropping_, the earth also required it.\r\nFaithful to this absurd analogy, the French landlord binds down his\r\ntenent by lease, not to crop the soil more than _three_ years in\r\n_four_, which in effect is to consign to barrenness or weeds, one\r\nfourth of the whole arable land of France yearly!\r\n\r\n2. There is not a sufficiently fixed, or steady proportion, between\r\n_arable_ and _pasture_ land.--The production of grain is the great\r\nobject of culture--often with too little regard to the nature of the\r\nsoil, and generally without any to its improvement. \"Where pasturage\r\nis scanty, where natural meadows are bad, where artificial are rare,\r\nand root husbandry little extended, cattle cannot be either numerous\r\nor well conditioned; and as without these there can be no manure, so\r\nwithout manure there can be no abundance.\"[17]\r\n\r\n  [17] Herbin's statistique Gen. de la France Vol. I. introduc.\r\n\r\n3. The land is generally worked by _farmers, hired for that purpose,\r\nor by renters on short leases_; which in neither case betters the\r\ncondition of the soil; the one having no interest in improvements,\r\nand the other too small a one to justify any expense in making them.\r\n\r\n4. A _good rotation system_, adapted to the soil and climate, is not\r\nabsolutely unknown, and may be found even in whole districts (as\r\nin French Flanders) but much too rarely. We have seen _wheat_ and\r\n_fallows_ alternately for years; and _wheat_, _rye_, _hemp_, and\r\n_rye_, and many others equally ridiculous.\r\n\r\n5. To the eye, more than one half of France is a common, without\r\nfences of any kind, excepting garden or park walls. Can there be\r\norder, economy and security, under such circumstances? Can the\r\n_police_ and the _gens d'armes_ be sufficient substitutes?\r\n\r\n  [_Albany Argus._\r\n\r\n  (To be continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Moral Plough Boy._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that volume whose morality is as sound, as the religion, it\r\ninculcates is celestial; and which is in fact an inexhaustible\r\nsource of human wisdom, as well as a pure and incorruptible fountain\r\nof divine light; we are taught to \"_despise not the day of small\r\nthings_.\"\r\n\r\nHow much better off than they are, would thousands of their\r\ncountrymen be at this moment, had this injunction never failed\r\nof its proper effect upon their conduct! If they had constantly\r\ncherished it in their recollection and carried it into practice in\r\ntheir daily occupations. But to contemplate the past or the present\r\nis needless, if it be not with a view to awaken the soul not only to\r\na proper train of reflection, but to a salutary system of practice\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\nIf we had not \"_despised the day of small things_,\" and sought\r\ntoo eagerly after brilliant speculations and splendid fortunes,\r\nthousands of us might now be blessed with ease and competence, and\r\nstill animated by a sober and useful spirit of industry, who are, on\r\nthe contrary, plunged into embarrasment, stripped of our property,\r\nand paralyzed in our energies.\r\n\r\nWe began the world with fair prospects, and we thought, at the same\r\ntime with firm resolutions not to blast them by seeking too eagerly\r\nafter _fairer_ ones; but man is rarely contented with what is simply\r\ngood or bright; he must have something _better_ and _brighter_.\r\nThere is always some tree whose fruit is forbidden, or beyond his\r\nreach, but of which he cannot rest easy till he has tasted. He\r\ncan never think of resting upon the clear declivity, whilst the\r\n\"cloud-capped\" summit is above him, veiling something which he has\r\nnot seen, and which may be, as he is apt to imagine, a pleasing, a\r\nvaluable or a wonderful discovery.\r\n\r\nThus it is that we always reject the good within our grasp, in\r\nthe delusive hope of grasping something better beyond it; that we\r\nlose sight of the content and happiness which are to-day within\r\nour reach; and look to the morrow to bring forth that which will\r\nsatisfy our desires, and cause us to rejoice in our existence. But\r\nthe morrow comes, our anticipations are not realized, and we vainly\r\nregret that we had not enjoyed the day before, as we might have\r\ndone, without trusting to a deceitful futurity.\r\n\r\nWe aim to inculcate moderation in the desire of wealth, or of\r\nany other acquisition which is supposed to contribute to human\r\nhappiness, combined with a steady, industrious and persevering\r\nattention to the means of obtaining what we desire. To this end, we\r\nmust not \"_despise the day of small things_;\" but must set out in\r\nevery undertaking with a determination to take advantage of the most\r\ntrivial, as well as the most important circumstance, calculated to\r\nfavour our designs. We must watch with the eyes of an _Argus_ for\r\nOpportunity, never forgetting, that she is bald behind, and must\r\ntherefore be caught by the forelock, if caught at all. When once\r\nshe turns her back upon us, she is soon out of sight, and we vainly\r\nattempt to overtake her. She mocks at our folly, and leaves us to\r\nbrood, in hopeless amazement, over our own blindness and imbecility.\r\n\r\nBut who are they that \"_despise the day of small things_?\" They\r\nare too numerous for description in a brief essay; but we shall\r\npoint out a few, and leave the reader's imagination to enlarge the\r\ncatalogue.\r\n\r\nThe MECHANIC who puts off a small job, as unworthy of his attention,\r\nbecause he happens to have a larger one on hand; without stopping\r\nto reflect, that small streams are more numerous than large ones;\r\nthat the former continually supply the latter; and that by a steady\r\nsuccession of small jobs, he may acquire a capital to execute large\r\nones upon his own account.\r\n\r\nThe MERCHANT who will sit behind his counter with a segar in his\r\nmouth, and think it derogatory to his dignity to reply to a demand\r\nfor a shilling's worth of any thing. Such \"_small things_\" are too\r\ninsignificant for this man of smoke; and consequently when those who\r\ncall for them, and find themselves neglected, have occasion to make\r\na _large_ purchase, they go to him, who will not only lay down his\r\nsegar, but leave his dinner, if required to wait upon them in ever\r\nso small a way.\r\n\r\nThe PHYSICIAN, who passes by the the poor man's door hardly stopping\r\nto give a hasty prescription, although he never fails to loiter in\r\nthe sick rooms of the rich and the powerful, till his sycophancy\r\nbecomes as disgusting to the mind, as his medicine is nauseating to\r\nthe stomach of his patient.\r\n\r\nThe LAWYER who turns a deaf ear to an honest client with but _five_\r\ndollars in his pocket; but is quick of hearing when accosted by a\r\nparty with a _fifty dollar bill_, and not over scrupulous either\r\nabout the justice of the cause.\r\n\r\nThe CLERGYMAN--and what shall we say of the Clergyman, who\r\n\"_despises the day of small things_;\" who forsakes and forgets the\r\npoor, but pious flock, which first cherished him, to gratify his\r\npride and ambition, and acquire those robes and riches which moths\r\nmay corrupt and thieves may steal; and who is so eager withal to\r\nmake converts, that he does not stop to be satisfied that conversion\r\nis the offspring of conviction, forgetting how much joy there is in\r\nHeaven over one sinner that truly repenteth; and that the hope of\r\nthe hypocrite shall perish for-ever!\r\n\r\nThe FARMER who clears more land than he can cultivate to advantage,\r\ndestroying the present and preventing the future growth of timber to\r\nno purpose; who keeps his produce on hand, when he can get a good\r\nand saving price, in hopes it may rise; who sells it at last for\r\nless than he could have had at first; and who is not as grateful to\r\nGod for a scanty harvest, as he is for a plentiful one.\r\n\r\nWe might enlarge the catalogue of those, who, by \"_despising the day\r\nof small things_,\" never arrive at that of great ones; but we do\r\nnot wish to tire the reader with a tedious essay, when a light and\r\npleasant one is our aim.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one precious delinquent, in whose soul we would\r\ngladly awaken those moral energies which alone can save it from\r\neventual ruin; from the tortures of self condemnation, the contempt\r\nof mankind, and the horrors of despair.\r\n\r\nWe mean the YOUNG STUDENT of GENIUS, who consumes the vigour of his\r\nyouth in the haunts of vice and infamy--who despises the minutia\r\nof his profession, whatever it may be, and wantonly neglects his\r\ndaily studies for the _present_, in pursuit of pleasure, intending,\r\nperhaps, to make great and rapid strides at a _future_ time--but\r\nwhen that time arrives may find his former neglect and dissipation\r\nhave destroyed the energies of his mind, and left it like a sieve,\r\nincapable of containing any thing but dregs! In this case the ruin\r\nis indeed a melancholy one; for instead of being \"led, through paths\r\nof glory, to the grave,\" the stews and the state prison are too\r\noften the pathways of such a youth to that closing scene; and his\r\n_hic jacet_ may be found, if found at all, in the _Potter's field_,\r\nthat last receptacle of the dregs of humanity! Think of this, ye\r\ngiddy, ye thoughtless young men, who are squandering your precious\r\nmoments in idleness and vice, dishonouring yourselves, disgusting\r\nyour friends, disappointing the expectations of your country,\r\nbreaking the hearts of your fond parents, and bringing their \"grey\r\nhairs with sorrow to the grave!\" How bitter will be your feelings,\r\nwhen you are driven to reflect, as you finally must be, and perhaps\r\nat the foot of the gallows, that by your folly and wickedness, you\r\nhave not only sealed your own ruin, but madly\r\n\r\n          \"Steep'd a mother's couch in tears,\r\n    \"And ting'd a father's glowing cheek with shame!\"\r\n\r\nMany of those giddy young men, to whom these remarks apply, may\r\nperhaps sneer at the idea of being brought up at last, in their mad\r\ncareer, by the arm of the public executioner. But let them turn, in\r\nsome hour of solitude, if such hours ever bless them with the sweets\r\nof calm reflection, to the pages of the _Criminal Recorder_! They\r\nwill there find, that from GEORGE BARNWELL, down to JAMES HAMILTON,\r\nthose who have died upon the gallows have not always plunged at\r\nonce into the depths of depravity; but have gone on, step by step,\r\nfrom slight deviations to serious ones, till they have lost all\r\nsense of shame, and become rebels to God as well as man. In this\r\ndegraded state of their souls, they have not stopt at the brothel,\r\nthe cock-pit, or the gambling table; but urged by the demons of\r\nhell, they have wantonly seized the dagger of assassination, and\r\nbathed it in the blood of innocence! thus closing their criminal\r\ncareer by a deed of desperation.\r\n\r\n  H. H. jr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Nicholson's Prize Essay.\r\n\r\n     _On a Rotation of Crops, and the most profitable mode of\r\n     collecting, preserving, and applying Manures._\r\n\r\n(Communicated to the Albany County Agricultural Society.)\r\n\r\n[CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the third year, we propose to sow the ground with\r\nbarley, after two or three ploughings--seed, two and a half bushels\r\nto the acre. At the same time also, give the ground at least 12\r\npounds of red clover seed to the acre, which may be carefully mixed\r\nwith the barley, and sown together. Harrow the ground before sowing,\r\nand harrow in the seed, after it has been prepared in the manner\r\nbefore directed; then, if the farmer is in possession of the roller,\r\nlet this be passed over the ground, particularly if it be somewhat\r\ndry; for, in such case, barley, being covered with a husk, requires\r\na close envelopement with earth, in order that the progress of its\r\ngermination be not either partially or wholly retarded. Next spring\r\ngive the ground a top dressing of gypsum, of from one to two bushels\r\nto the acre, as circumstances may seem to require.--Two clover\r\ncrops are to be expected this season. The next, either one or two\r\nmay be taken, according to the climate, but usually one only in\r\nmore northerly regions; and in this case let the second growth be\r\nlaid prostrate, by the roller passing over it in the same direction\r\nin which the plough is to follow, in order that the growth may be\r\ncarefully turned under, which will form an excellent lay for winter\r\nwheat, or for rye, if the climate is not adapted to the growth of\r\nthe former crop. In suitable climates, wheat will succeed on a good\r\nclover lay even on light sandy lands. It is believed, however,\r\nthat the species of wheat which is considerably cultivated in\r\nPennsylvania, called spelt, (_triticum spelta_) may be successfully\r\ncultivated in any part of the northern states where wheat of the\r\ncommon sorts do not flourish.--When the sward has thus been turned\r\nunder, let the surface be levelled by running the harrow lightly\r\nover it, in the same direction in which the plough runs, and then\r\ncover the seed with the harrow, run in a similar direction. Let the\r\nseed wheat be prepared in the manner before described, and let it\r\nbe free from any mixture of rye, or the seeds of cockle, or other\r\nweeds. Next spring give the ground another top dressing of gypsum,\r\nin order that a growth of white clover may rise after harvest, as\r\nthis will afford considerable fall feed, and a fresh sward to be\r\nturned under in the latter part of the fall, the effect of which\r\nwill be explained when speaking of manures, &c.\r\n\r\nThus our rotation requires six seasons for its completion, and\r\nis composed of six or more different and successive crops. In\r\nexhibiting our plan, we intend it merely as an outline of what\r\nwe deem at least one of the best and most profitable systems\r\nof culture that can be pursued in good arable lands, where all\r\nobstructions to the most complete culture have been removed.--Other\r\ncourses may probably be devised which may be as good, but we feel\r\nconfident there can be none better. We consider this rotation\r\nas comprehending a sufficient variety of crops for every purpose\r\nof affording the land rest by changes; and although a course of\r\nrotation might be made to include a greater variety of crops,\r\nstill the profits of them in the aggregate, would probably be less\r\nthan in the plan we propose. We insist much on the culture of root\r\ncrops for the greatest possible profits. In some instances the\r\ngrowths of roots and vines we propose, as well as of the grain\r\ncrops, might be substituted for others, and sometimes, for the sake\r\nof further variety of growths, particularly of roots, it might\r\nbe advisable; all this must, however, depend on the soil, and on\r\nother circumstances. If the soil be rich and deep, perhaps the\r\nmangel wurzel, should have a preference to the common turnip, and\r\nthe pumpkin, in the first years crop, and perhaps in such soil the\r\ncabbage culture should sometimes come in for a share.\r\n\r\nWe should hardly advise that crops of carrots or of parsnips should\r\never enter the list of a general rotation of crops, as they require\r\npeculiar soils, and uncommon preparation. They are very valuable\r\ncrops for particular purposes, but their uses for feeding and\r\nfatting cattle seem to be in a great measure superseded by the less\r\nexpensive culture of the crops before-mentioned. There are, however\r\nsome mellow fertile soils, of sandy texture, where these roots,\r\nparticularly carrots, may be cultivated with great advantage. A very\r\nserious objection to the culture of parsnips is, that in the soils\r\nmost suitable for them they extend so deeply that their extraction\r\nfrom the earth is a matter of no small difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn recommending the alternate culture of the pumpkin with the corn\r\ncrop, we have been influenced by two considerations; firstly, from\r\nan account we have lately seen of a trial made of the culture of\r\nthe large sort of pumpkin by itself, in which at the rate of 25\r\ntons to the acre were raised; and, secondly we are of opinion that\r\nin cultivating the crop in the way we propose, nearly as great a\r\nproduct may be obtained as if the ground were planted entirely\r\nwith this crop.--Growing in drills by itself it will not impede\r\nthe growth of the corn, nor do we conceive that this crop will be\r\ninjured by the extension of the pumpkin vines over the ground;\r\nwhereas if the two crops were planted together in the same hills, or\r\ndrills, as is commonly practised, the growth of the one must, in a\r\ngreat measure, serve to rob the other of its due share of nutriment.\r\nThe large sort of pumpkin, to which we have reference, has been\r\nraised of the weight of upwards of 150 pounds, but it is probably\r\nless nutritious, because less sweet, than pumpkins of the common\r\nsorts. Another large sort, which we have seen exhibited in this\r\ncounty, of more than four feet in length, is probably entitled to a\r\npreference for culture, as it appears to be as sweet as pumpkins of\r\nthe smaller kinds.\r\n\r\nIn selecting seed for the pumpkin crop, take such plants as bear the\r\ngreatest weight of pumpkins, and from the largest of these let the\r\nseed be preserved.\r\n\r\nWe have next to speak of the rotations proper for clayey lands,\r\nor those which have more or less alumin in their composition.\r\nLands of this description are various, as well in regard to their\r\nnatural fertility, as to their being more or less inclined to\r\na superabundance of moisture. Some are naturally too wet for\r\ncultivating even grain crops with success, and should therefore\r\nbe kept for mowing and grazing lands. Some again may be merely\r\ntoo wet for crops of winter grain, and in such case spring crops\r\nshould be substituted, while at the same time the lands should be\r\nmore applied to the business of the dairy, and of the grazier. In\r\nthe mean time, let the possessor of lands which are naturally\r\ntoo wet, proceed to laying at least a part of them dry, by hollow\r\ndrains; and then by making his barn dung principally into heaps\r\nof compost, in which lime and sand shall be considerably used as\r\nadditional ingredients, and applying such compost manure to the\r\ndrilled crops before-mentioned, and in the manner before directed,\r\nhe will find no difficulty whatever in pursuing the course of crops\r\nwe have recommended, nor of raising them of luxuriant growth. Where\r\nclayey lands are naturally dry enough for winter crops, we advise\r\nto a similar course of crops, with the manure prepared and used in\r\na similar manner. In all stiff soils, however, an important point\r\nin husbandry, is to keep the ground, while under a course of crops,\r\nin a mellow crumbly state; and for this purpose nothing is more\r\nconducive than frequent deep ploughings, and raising the ground into\r\nhigh narrow ridges, as well to lie in that state during winter, as\r\nfor the culture of all the drilled crops in particular. The ridges\r\nare to be formed by four gathering furrows, and in cleaving the\r\nridges down new ones are formed with the middle or highest part\r\nof each where the last furrows were of the former ridges. When,\r\ntherefore, the manure is to be used for the drilled crop, it is to\r\nbe laid in the furrows, between the ridges, and then covered over\r\nwith two gathering furrows run on each side, and thus the beds or\r\nridges for the crop prepared.\r\n\r\nIf, however, it should still be found that some clays, even with\r\nthis management for the purpose of ameliorating them, should still\r\nbe found unsuitable for Indian corn, and for the turnip and ruta\r\nbaga crops, we can only advise that, for the former, the Windsor\r\nbean, and for the two latter the mangle wurzel and the cabbage crop,\r\nbe made substitutes. The Windsor bean is considerably cultivated\r\nin the clay lands of Great Britain; and Mr. Deane, in his Farmer's\r\nDictionary, says its growth on such lands in this country is\r\nluxuriant. Perhaps in place of this species of the bean, another,\r\nwhich is cultivated in the southern states, and is there called the\r\ncow pea, should be prefered.\r\n\r\nIt should be further observed, that gypsum, when applied as a top\r\ndressing to clay lands, particularly those which are too wet,\r\nhas but very little effect; but when they are laid dry by hollow\r\ndrains, and thrown into ridges as before-mentioned, the effect of\r\nthis manure upon them is nearly the same as in other dry arable\r\nlands.--And as we conceive it essentially necessary that all clay\r\nlands which are to be cultivated for spring crops, as well as all\r\nother soils which are naturally too wet, should lie in ridges during\r\nthe winter, we advise that, at the beginning of the rotation we have\r\nmentioned, such lands have a second ploughing in the fall, for the\r\npurpose of being laid in such ridges. When thus laid they are easily\r\nreduced to a mellow state in the spring; but if this be neglected,\r\nthey will usually be found, more or less, in hard baked clods, a\r\nstate very unfit for good cultivation.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain it is found essentially requisite that clay lands\r\nshould be effectually summer fallowed as often as every sixth year;\r\nas well for the purpose of extirpating growths of weeds, as for\r\nmellowing the soil, and rendering it more lively. A fallowing there\r\nis performed by many repeated ploughings and harrowings during the\r\nsummer. But it should be remembered that the climate of that country\r\nis very different from this. Their wheat harvest is in autumn, their\r\nsummers being wet and cool. Here we have time after the harvest is\r\nover to cleanse and enliven the soil by repeated ploughings and\r\nharrowings.\r\n\r\nOn hard gravelly lands, which are unfit for any crops of roots,\r\nexcept perhaps potatoes, no very extensive rotation can be had\r\nto advantage without plentiful manuring. Gypsum has a powerful\r\neffect on such lands, and with the aid of this manure alone even\r\nthe poorest of gravels may be made to yield good crops of buckwheat\r\nand of red clover; and on a lay of this latter crop turned under,\r\na tolerable good crop of rye may be had. St. Foin, and some other\r\ntap rooted grasses, flourish in such soils better than might be\r\nexpected. Gravelly lands require very deep and frequent ploughings,\r\nin order to make them sufficiently retentive of moisture. They are\r\nusually much assisted by compost manures where clay, mud, upland\r\nmarl, &c. form a considerable share of the ingredients. But as there\r\nare different degrees of fertility in gravelly lands, according\r\nto the nature of the gravel, and its greater or less predominance\r\nin the soil, we can lay down no definite course of crops that in\r\nall cases would be found most advisable. Say, however, that with\r\neffectual deep ploughings, and plenty of suitable manure for the\r\ndrills, the first crop shall be Indian corn, intermixed with the\r\npotato and the pumpkin growths, as before-mentioned; next spring,\r\noats, or barley, if the ground will answer for this crop. As soon\r\nas this crop comes off, turn the stubble under, and harrow in\r\nbuckwheat for a green dressing, in the manner mentioned in treating\r\nof manures, and on this growth, turned under, sow rye, if the ground\r\nis too gravelly for wheat. Sow the clover seed the next spring, in\r\nthe quantity before-mentioned, and then harrow the ground, which\r\nwill serve the purpose of covering the seed, and also of assisting\r\nthe growth of the crop of wheat, or rye, as the case may be. The\r\nadvantage derived from harrowing these crops in the spring has been\r\nwell ascertained by experiment. After the second year's growth of\r\nclover has been fed or mowed off, turn over the ground in the fall\r\nto commence the rotation anew.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of gravelly lands, we do not mean to include those\r\nwhich are, properly speaking gravelly loams; for soils of this\r\ndescription are generally well fitted for the rotation first\r\nmentioned. By gravelly lands we mean those where gravel is mostly\r\npredominant, as we call those lands sandy where silex forms the\r\ngreatest proportion of the soil, and of these something is now to be\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of what may be called light sandy lands we will refer\r\nto much of those lying between Albany and Schenectady. These, like\r\nthe gravelly lands just mentioned, are not, in their natural state,\r\ncalculated for the production of many different crops in perfection,\r\nnor indeed for any without manure. With the aid of gypsum alone,\r\nhowever, good crops of peas, and of buckwheat, may be had on most\r\nof these lands, tolerable of red clover, and on the lay of clover\r\nturned under, middling crops of rye may be had. Probably, with this\r\nmanure, valuable crops of pumpkins might be raised on them. Lands\r\nof this description have, however, very essential properties, which\r\ngravelly lands do not possess; they are much easier cultivated than\r\nthe harder soils, and, in proportion to their natural fertility,\r\nno lands are better adapted for root crops of almost every sort,\r\nor for the grasses whose roots extend deep into the earth, among\r\nwhich are clover of different kinds, St. Foin, Lucerne, &c.--Such\r\nlands are least adapted for crops of wheat and Indian corn; but when\r\nsufficiently manured with clay, or upland marle, which is better,\r\nthey will yield tolerable crops of the latter, and also of the\r\nformer, when raised on a lay of red clover.\r\n\r\nWhere little else than the contents of the barn yard and gypsum\r\ncan be had for manuring sandy lands of the above description,\r\nthe common turnip and ruta baga culture would not, perhaps, be\r\nadvisable, but the rotation should be something like the following:\r\nFirst year, potatoes and pumpkins in alternate drills, manured and\r\ntreated as before described; second, peas, soaked in the solution\r\nbefore-mentioned, and rolled in gypsum before sowing, with a top\r\ndressing of that manure; third, buckwheat, treated in the same\r\nmanner, and clover seed sown with the crop; third and fourth,\r\nclover, with a top dressing of gypsum each spring; fifth, rye, on\r\nthe clover turned under, as before described, which completes the\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nBut where upland marle, or even clay, can be had, for the purpose\r\nof forming compost manures with the barn dung and the addition of\r\nsome lime, as is described under manures, &c. we should advise to\r\nthe rotation first described, or something similar, in which the\r\nroot crops should form a prominent part; and in such case, let\r\nthe manure be plentifully applied to the drilled crops. At first,\r\nperhaps, some of the crops would not be so abundant; but under this\r\nmanagement the soil would be constantly improving, and of course the\r\ncrops increasing. At first, perhaps, rye should be substituted for\r\nthe wheat crop, but each addition to the soil of the caluminous and\r\ncalcarious matter, of which the compost is principally composed,\r\nwould render the land better adapted for grain crops of every\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of the first importance to the cultivator to possess\r\nan adequate knowledge of the different substances which may be used\r\nwith advantage for fertilizing his land, of the different soils to\r\nwhich such substances are best adapted, of the proper quantities\r\nto be used, and of the most advantageous time and manner of their\r\napplication. There is but little even of the richest earths that\r\nwill not become exhausted with constant cropping without manure; and\r\nsoils are seldom so sterile, but that with a proper application of\r\nsuitable manures to them, they may be made the residence of plenty.\r\n\r\nManures are of different kinds: of animal, of vegetable, of fossil,\r\nand of mixed; of each of which notice will be taken in their order.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of animals is an excellent manure for all soils, and\r\nis used to a considerable extent on the sea coast, where fish\r\nare caught in plenty. It is believed that flesh is used to most\r\nadvantage in composts, and the same may be observed with more\r\ncertainty in regard to the use of the blood. The shavings of the\r\nhorney substances of animals, have very desirable effects as a\r\nmanure, in dry soil, by enduing such with a greater power to retain\r\nmoisture: and the same may also be observed of the hair and wool.\r\nThe bones, when calcined, are also valuable, as they are principally\r\nphosphate of lime. The miasma, produced by the putrefaction of\r\nthe flesh and blood of animals, is also food for plants, or at\r\nleast its presence assists their growth. The urine is a fertilizer\r\nprincipally by reason of the salt it contains, and probably also by\r\nits producing miasma.\r\n\r\nWhen animals die, it is usual to let them lie above ground, to the\r\nannoyance of the public; but, if covered with earth, this together\r\nwith the flesh, &c. of the animal, would be converted into good\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\nOf vegetable substances, it may be generally observed, that almost\r\nevery sort of vegetable, not of woody texture, buried in the soil\r\nwhile green, is more or less efficacious as a manure; and that many\r\nsorts of these, when turned under where they grew, and while in a\r\ngreen state, will add much more fertility to the soil than their\r\ngrowth extracted from it; but that the same growth, when suffered\r\nto ripen on the ground, and then turned under, after the exhaustion\r\nof its juices, will not generally repay the soil the nutriment it\r\nextracted from it while growing. It would seem that the ripening\r\nof plants is the principal cause of the exhaustion of soils, and,\r\nfor this reason, green dressings, that is, ploughing of green crops\r\nunder, has been found advantageous in enriching lands. Where green\r\ndressings are resorted to, as a manure, such growth should be\r\nselected for the purpose as are cheap in the article of seed, and at\r\nthe same time quick and bulky in their growths. Buckwheat has been\r\nmuch used for the purpose, though perhaps some other plants should\r\nbe preferred. The growth should be turned under when in blossom;\r\nand, in order that this be done effectually, it should be laid\r\nprostrate, by running the roller over it, in the same direction in\r\nwhich the plough is to follow; after which, the ground should not be\r\nstirred again till this manure has sufficiently rotted. Generally,\r\nwe think it would be most advisable to sow on the lay or furrow, by\r\nwhich the green crop is turned under.\r\n\r\nThere may be some instances where manuring with green dressings may\r\nbe advisable, particularly where it can be done without preventing\r\nthe growth of any intervening crop: Where this is not practicable,\r\nwe should hardly advise to this method of manuring, unless in\r\ncases where other manures were not to be obtained. One case we\r\nwill however mention, where a green dressing might be given to\r\nadvantage. Suppose, for instance, a crop of rye, oats, or barley,\r\nharvested, and the ground cleared of the crop by the 20th of July;\r\nin that case, let the stubble be immediately turned under, and the\r\nground harrowed in with buckwheat; by the 20th of September this\r\ngrowth would be fit to be turned under, when a crop of wheat might\r\nbe sown on the lay. It should be understood, that rye is one of the\r\nbest crops to precede a crop of wheat, or to follow it. In the same\r\nmanner, therefore, the crop for a green dressing may be raised in\r\nthe wheat stubble turned under, and the green crop turned under for\r\na crop of rye.\r\n\r\nBut the contents of the barn-yard, and the excrements of cattle, are\r\nthe principal sources of manure of the vegetable kind; and of these\r\nit is necessary to treat particularly, as well of the qualities of\r\nthe different sorts, as of their most advantageous applications to\r\nsoils. The sorts of dung or excrement to be noticed, are those of\r\nhorses, neat cattle, sheep, and swine. The dung of swine is most\r\nvaluable, where properly applied; that of sheep is the next; that of\r\ncows ranges in the third degree, and that of horses in the fourth.\r\nThe dung of the latter, if suffered to lie in a heap till it becomes\r\nthoroughly heated, assumes a white, or mouldy colour, and is then\r\nof but little value. It is of a warm nature, and is best adapted\r\nfor being well buried in moist or clayey soils; cow dung on the\r\ncontrary, is most suitable for dry soils; sheep dung answers best\r\non the soils for which that of horses is best suited, but is very\r\nvaluable for almost any soil. Hog dung should only be applied to dry\r\narable lands, and is most powerful in those of a sandy or gravelly\r\nnature. Dung, of all sorts, loses much of its valuable qualities by\r\nexposure to frequent rains, particularly when lying at but little\r\ndepth over a considerable surface. Its good qualities are best\r\npreserved by lying in large heaps, and if under cover so much the\r\nbetter. The stercorary is the most effectual method for preserving\r\nbarn dung, and it is believed that every farmer will find his money\r\nwell expended in the erection of this receptacle for the contents\r\nof that part of his barn-yard, which is not used in the spring.\r\nThe stercorary may serve for a sheep fold during winter, and will\r\nthus answer a two fold purpose. It may be, for instance, 40 feet\r\nin length, 16 in breadth, and of suitable height. The floor is to\r\nbe made of a layer of clay, with the surface smoothly paved with\r\nsmall stones, and highest in the middle, so that the juices of the\r\ndung may run off to the sides, where a gutter receives this liquid,\r\nand carried it into a reservoir, sunk at one end, into which a pump\r\nis to be fixed to raise the liquid and throw it back over the heap.\r\nThe floor, gutter, and reservoir, are on a plan similar to those\r\nof a cider press. The liquid that runs from the heap is the most\r\nvaluable part, and should never be lost: this plan is therefore\r\ncalculated to preserve it; and, for the purpose of absorbing the\r\nwhole of it, any dry vegetable matter, or rich earth, may be laid\r\nover the heap, and this liquid thrown on that, which will serve to\r\nconvert the whole into good manure. The juices and the soluble and\r\ngaseous parts of the excrements of cattle, together with the stale,\r\nare what principally affords nutriment for growing plants; and every\r\nmeans by which these can be saved, by their being absorbed in other\r\nsubstances, of rich earthy or vegetable matter, would seem to be\r\nwell worthy of attention. We will next designate what is usually\r\nconsidered the methods most proper for the application of dung.\r\n\r\nWhere lands are in grasses of the fibrous rooted kinds, it is the\r\ngenerally received opinion of the best cultivators, that barn dung,\r\nas well as every other kind, should be applied as a top dressing,\r\nthat is, by spreading it on the surface; but that for tap rooted\r\ngrasses, or those whose roots extend deeply, as well as for all\r\ngrain and root crops, this manure should be buried in the soil, at\r\nsuch depths as are best suited to the nature of the roots of the\r\nplants to be cultivated. The operation of barn dung, and of all\r\nvegetable and animal substances used in manure, seems to be this:\r\nIf laid at a certain depth beneath the surface of the soil, in the\r\nprogress of their decomposition their soluble parts pass into the\r\nform of gas, or vapour, and of course rise to the surface, and in\r\ntheir ascent are more or less absorbed by the roots of the plants;\r\non the contrary, if these manures be laid on the surface, these\r\nsoluble parts, in the progress of decomposition, never become\r\naeriform, but are washed downwards, in their liquid state, where\r\nthey are in like manner absorbed by the roots of the plants. This\r\nis probably as correct an explanation as can be given of the effect\r\nof these manures. It is well known, that ground long used as a\r\ngraveyard, becomes very fertile, notwithstanding the substances\r\nwhich are the cause of such fertility, are laid at a very great\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nIt has been held by some English writers that barn dung should\r\nbe well rotted previous to its application as a manure, but this\r\nopinion is rejected by Sir Humphrey Davy, one of the most scientific\r\nagriculturists of Great Britain, and also by Arthur Young, Esq. Mr.\r\nDavy contends that this manure may in most instances be as well\r\napplied fresh as in any other way, by its being laid at a proper\r\ndepth beneath the surface, and that in scarcely any instance it\r\nis advisable that it should undergo more than the first stage of\r\ndecomposition before it is used. When well rotted it is, however,\r\nmore efficacious for a single crop, but its use is of much shorter\r\nduration. It seems, also, to be generally agreed that using this\r\nmanure for drill crops, burying it at a good depth, and raising the\r\nplants over the dung thus buried, is the best possible way in which\r\nit can be used. We lately saw an account published of upwards of\r\n100 bushels of Indian corn to the acre being raised by this mode of\r\nculture. The success of Mr. Cobbett, and others, in raising great\r\ncrops of ruta baga by this method of using this manure, seems to\r\ndemonstrate its utility, if evidence was wanting further than what\r\nappears in English publications on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe plan that we would therefore recommend, is, to apply the fresh\r\nbarn dung to all drill crops which are to be put in the ground in\r\nthe spring, and for these we refer to what has been said under\r\nrotation of crops. The shortest dung should be used for these\r\npurposes, except for potatoes, and it should, as far as practicable,\r\nbe applied to the soils best adapted for each kind of dung, as has\r\nbefore been mentioned. The longer or more strawey parts of the dung\r\nwe should advise to be laid in the stercorary, if this building has\r\nbeen provided, or else somewhere under cover; or if no cover can\r\nbe afforded, let it be thrown into a heap about 3 or 4 feet high;\r\nand wherever it be laid let it be stirred up from the bottom in the\r\ncourse of about five or six weeks after it has thus been heaped or\r\notherwise stored away, after which it will soon be found well fitted\r\nfor being used for the crop of ruta baga. It is also advisable to\r\ncover the heap with a layer of good earth, which will serve to\r\nabsorb and retain much of the steam or gaseous matter that rises\r\nfrom the heap, and when saturated with this, and mixed with the mass\r\nof dung, will be found a valuable addition.\r\n\r\n  (To be continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCER.\r\n\r\n_On the Grape Vine, with its wines, brandies, and dried fruits._\r\n\r\nNo. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo principle of action in the business and industry of the United\r\nStates has been so beneficial to them as the adoption of _new\r\nobjects of culture_ by the planters and farmers, whose old objects\r\nof culture were likely to become redundant, and to fall in price.\r\n_Cotton_ and _sugar_ are well known and important examples. There\r\nare good grounds for estimating our whole cotton of our best year,\r\n(Sept. 1817, to Sept. 1818,) at forty-two millions of dollars,\r\naccording to the price on the wharves of our sea-ports for that\r\nwhich was exported to foreign countries, and the price at our\r\nfactories, stores, and dwellings, of that which was manufactured at\r\nhome. It is now manifest that the East Indian and South American\r\ncotton greatly injure our markets; and as this arises from growing,\r\npermanent, and substantial causes, there is reason to expect the\r\ncontinuance of the injury to us from the foreign rival cotton\r\ncultivation. A brief and plain view of the history and prospect\r\nof cotton, will be found in the Philadelphia edition (A.D. 1818)\r\nof _Rees' English Cyclopædia_, by Murray, Bradford & Co. under\r\nthe article or head of the \"_United States_.\" The facts there\r\nstated, with many known subsequent circumstances, will give rise\r\nto serious reflections, in the minds of the landholder and the\r\nstatesman, upon the subject of the protection of the productions\r\nof our own soil. The industry of the landed men of the United\r\nStates is manifestly and unalterably much greater than any, and\r\nthan all, the other branches of our domestic or national industry.\r\nThe mercantile and manufacturing branches result almost entirely\r\nfrom the landed industry. While, therefore, the legislative and\r\nexecutive governments raise revenues of 27½ to 60 per cent. on a\r\ngreat quantity of foreign cotton cloths from India and Europe, and\r\na greater revenue from the foreign manufactures of tobacco, and a\r\nstill greater revenue from the foreign manufactures of grain, of\r\nfruit, and of the cane, to the great fundamental and convenient\r\nsupport of American manufactures, and while they are free to go\r\nfurther, if they find it right, in the joint encouragement of our\r\nagricultural and manufacturing industry it will be found beneficial\r\nto the landed interest to inquire into other means of promoting\r\nthe prosperity of the _Colossus of our country_--the agricultural\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that, between the sites of the vineyards\r\nof the Lower Schuylkill, Southwark, of Pennsylvania, Butler, of\r\nPennsylvania, Glasgow, of Kentucky, New Vevay, of Indiana, and\r\nHarmony, of the same state, on the north, and the coasts of the Gulf\r\nof Mexico, on the south, the United States possess the climates\r\nand soils of \"_the vine-covered hills and gay regions of France_.\"\r\nThe sweet orange grows, in safety, in groves and gardens, in the\r\nvicinity of New Orleans, at a greater distance from the sea than\r\nany place of equally safe growth, in Provence or Languedoc, of\r\nFrance. As our country shall be cleared and drained, our climate\r\nwill be still less severe in the states on the Mexican gulf. In the\r\nnorth, our climates of New Vevay and Harmony, in Indiana, Glasgow,\r\nin Kentucky, 37° to 38° 30' N. which are the present northern\r\nextremes of successful experiments in the vine cultivation, are as\r\nfavourable and mild as the climates of Champagne, Tokay, Lorraine,\r\nBurgundy, and Hockheim, which are fine northern regions of the\r\nvine in France and Germany. Between our New Vevay, in Indiana, and\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico, the states of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi,\r\nGeorgia, South and North Carolina, Tennessee, Indiana, and large\r\nparts of Virginia and Kentucky, must give us _all the vine climates\r\nof France_, _Germany_, _Switzerland_, and _Upper Italy_. This vine\r\ndistrict of the United States is much larger than all those vine\r\ncountries of France, Germany, Switzerland, and Upper Italy. The\r\ncrop of wine and brandy in the vine country of France alone--though\r\nour vine country is more than twice the size--has been estimated\r\nat 100 millions of dollars. Let us then consider the propriety\r\nof a diligent inquiry into the cultivation of the vine, and the\r\npreparation of wines, brandies, dried fruits, and cremor tartar, in\r\nthe United States, in order to maintain the prosperity of the landed\r\ninterest by the variety and prices of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe present duties on foreign distilled and fermented spirits and\r\nliquors, (brandy, gin, rum, arack, wines, beer, ale, and porter,)\r\nand on dried fruits, though laid for revenue, afford a great and\r\nsure encouragement to the establishment and the manufacture of\r\nthe grape. The demand will increase with our population, and the\r\nfacility and certainty of the culture and crop will grow with the\r\nclearing and draining of our country. Ridges, hills, mountains,\r\nrocky lands, any steep ground, gravelly, stony, sandy, and other\r\ninferior lands, (if only dry,) will yield profit in large crops\r\nor in fine qualities of wine, or both. Fresh and dried grapes are\r\nboth favourable to health and frugality. Ripe grapes have been\r\nadministered to whole regiments of troops in France, who have been\r\nravaged by fluxes and dysentaries.[18] The quantity of wine computed\r\nto be produced in France, is ten millions of casks, of nearly 63\r\ngallons each, on two millions of arpents (not 2,000,000 acres) of\r\nland, often not fit for wheat, rice, or tobacco, valued very low,\r\non a medium at fifty francs the cask or French hogsheads. This is\r\nthree times the value of the cotton crop of the U. States, on a\r\nmedium value, produced in 1818 or in 1819, and demands our early and\r\nserious attention, particularly from the Gulf of Mexico to the end\r\nof the 39th degree, when the country in that degree shall be cleared\r\nand drained in its wet or marshy parts.\r\n\r\n  [18] See Doctor Tissot's advice to the people of Lusanne.\r\n\r\nIt has been already observed, that ridges and hills are the most\r\nsuitable shape or form of country for vineyards. The most proper\r\nexposure is from south-east to south. It is believed that all\r\nsouthern exposures will do. The propagation may be by seeds, or by\r\ncuttings, or by bending and covering a part of an old vine so as to\r\nmake it grow out in another place at a proper distance. The plough\r\nis of much use in the cultivation, so that care must be taken to\r\nplant the vines at such distances as to facilitate the use of the\r\nplough and the harrow. The best grapes which can be obtained should\r\nbe used, in order to put the culture forward. These may be foreign\r\nor American, native or imported. A harsh grape to the taste may\r\nproduce a better wine than was expected, and more and better brandy.\r\nThe finest grapes of Europe and the African isles are supposed to be\r\nnative wildings improved by culture and selection. The region of the\r\nplum and peach appears to include the region of the vine. Although\r\nthe south is the proper sphere of the grape, its cultivation there\r\nwill leave the bread grains, tobacco, hemp, the grasses and cattle,\r\nto the more exclusive and profitable culture of the states north\r\nof the proper region of fine and abundant crops of wine. We pay\r\nannually to foreign nations a sum of money for wines, spirits,\r\nand materials to make spirits, and for fresh and dried grapes, as\r\ngreat as our whole specie medium. So important is this subject, in\r\nvarious points of view, to all the states, that it is respectfully\r\nrecommended to the superintendants of all our public, agricultural,\r\nand philosophical libraries, to procure all the treatises on the\r\nculture of vines and making of grapes which are to be found in the\r\nlanguages of France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe experiments made at Harmony in Pennsylvania, at Vevay, on the\r\nOhio, and Harmony, on the Ouabache, both in Indiana, merit the\r\nutmost attention of the United States. It appears that in the\r\npresent uncleared and uncultivated state of the country, Harmony,\r\non the Ohio, in Penn. was probably too far north for making wine,\r\nthough not for fruit. That Vevay and Harmony, in Indiana, are more\r\nsuitable climes for the wines, will appear from the following\r\nletter from a respectable gentleman at Vevay to a very respectable\r\nfriend of his, lately on a visit to Philadelphia. It is dated the\r\n28th of August, 1819. The intelligent and experienced writer from\r\nVevay, thus expresses himself: He \"thinks the whole of Alabama\r\ndoubtless better adapted to the culture of vines than the more\r\nnorthern country of the United States;[19] because the only two\r\nspecies of grapes that succeed in the United States are of the late\r\nsort, _having not time at Vevay, (Ind.) to ripen_. The Alabama\r\nseason, being longer, will give more time, especially the Madeira\r\ngrape, which gives the best wine of the two, where it can ripen and\r\nyields most. But it will not do at all at Vevay; and does better\r\nat Glasgow,[20] Ky. The various gardeners at Kentucky can furnish\r\nsome. Vine dressers would go to new vineyards from Vevay. They have\r\nhad 500 gallons of wine per acre at Vevay; more often 150; and 260\r\nis a good crop. The Madeira grape would give more than the Cape of\r\nGood Hope grape, _where it would prosper_, but must have time to\r\nripen, to be good. Of the labour, much may be done by women. They\r\ndo about half. The men trim, make layers to fill vacancies, plough,\r\nharrow, hoe, and carry the grapes, and make the wine. None of those\r\nworks are heavy. But trimming requires attention and discernment,\r\nfor the vine-dresser must look two years before him, when he cuts\r\neach scion; women never do it, though light work. He has seen many\r\nwomen do it as well as any man. A little work in vineyards is to\r\nbe done by night with lamps. When the grapes have got their size,\r\nthe crickets, (not of the house or field) eat, in the night, the\r\nbark of the stem of the bunches, and ring or girdle them so that\r\nthey die. They injure the bunches rapidly. They must be watched\r\nand searched for with lamps, by night, and destroyed. He says the\r\nnative vines will not do to graft good kinds of grapes on: he has\r\ntried it often, without success. Grape vines grafted on the same\r\nkinds do well, yet they are a different tree, being _dioic_, while\r\nthe vineferous kinds are _hermaphrodites_. I have found the same\r\nwild vines in Switzerland, and the kind called sour grapes makes\r\npretty good wines; but are a smaller bearer than the grape vines.\r\nThey are in Morerod's vineyard, at Glasgow, Kentucky. The Spanish\r\ngrapes of Mexico and South America should be tried. They have\r\nbeen long cultivated. He is raising grape vines from the seed, to\r\nobtain flavour and quantity of wine. _The vine is of long life_,\r\nbut it is ten or fifteen years before it bears _fully_ from the\r\n_seed_. Variety, however, is an object. Vines planted by cuttings,\r\nwhich have taken root freely in the first year, bear fruit in\r\nthree years: in five they are in full force. He has considered and\r\ninspected the vineyards of Europe, and the cultivation by the plough\r\nand otherwise. It is to be studied to _save labour_ and make the\r\n_greatest crops_. If the _fendant vert_ will grow as well here as in\r\nSwitzerland, 800 gallons per acre might be made. They cultivate by\r\nthe plough in Languedoc, about Montpelier and Lunel. We make wine\r\nhere to be like Madeira, and sell it at 37½ cents per quart,\r\nand $1 25 per gallon; but cannot make enough to send abroad, or\r\nto keep for ripening. Morerod made a cask of 800 gallons, full of\r\nwine, of last vintage, to be kept eighteen months or two years. He\r\nhas seen wine (made of grapes like Vevay) at Glasgow, (in Barren\r\ncounty, Kentucky,) better than Vevay wine. The grapes were gathered\r\na fortnight before the Vevay grapes. It is probable that wine of the\r\nbanks of Tennessee will make 1-4 brandy; if of Cape of Good Hope\r\ngrapes, common proof; Vevay yielded 1-5th; the best cider 1-10th;\r\nso do the best Burgundy wine, and that of the border of the lake of\r\nGeneva, in good years. The strongest of all the wines that I know\r\nof, is that of the south of France and Spain, which yields 1-3d\r\nbrandy. The peculiar mode of vine cultivation at Vevay, Indiana, is\r\nworthy of attention, being a combination of various European modes,\r\nand American improvements adapted to the country. Some young men,\r\nbred at Vevay, would be useful in other places. Mr. D. thinks the\r\nblacks may be taught to cultivate vines.\" So runs and concludes the\r\nletter from the judicious writer, at Vevay of the United States,\r\nsettled by persons from the original Vevay of Switzerland. It is\r\nvery instructive and would seem to prove, as so much of our country\r\ncontinues in the wood and forest state, and with many undrained\r\nswamps, making a humid atmosphere, and a moist soil. Vevay, in 38°\r\n30', is not yet perfectly so favourable, as the vicinity of Glasgow,\r\nin Kentucky, where a dry, hard soil, occasions the grape to be\r\nfreer from injury by moisture of the earth, and of the air. Glasgow\r\nis about one degree and one half more southern than Vevay. These\r\nindications are distinct, nice, clear, and strong in regard to the\r\nvine climate of our country, at present and in prospect.\r\n\r\n  [19] Vevay, on the Ohio, is in 38° 30' N.\r\n\r\n  [20] Glasgow is in 37°.\r\n\r\nIn the hilly Spanish colonial country of North America, about the\r\n29th degree of north latitude, south of the Rio bravo del Norte,\r\nthere is authentic evidence, in a report to the government, that\r\nthe vine grows well, though its culture was forbidden by the crown,\r\nproduces good crops of fine wine, and supplies the province and\r\nits neighbours. That country being as far south as any part of the\r\nFloridas, it is ascertained that, where this country has become, or\r\nshall be made dry enough and cleared, the vine region runs to the\r\nsouthern limits of the United States, even if we should maintain\r\nour right to Louisiana _in extenso_, in consequence of the apparent\r\nfrustration of our offer _to limit ourselves by the Sabine_.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished wine of Spain is the true and best _Xeres_,\r\nor Sherry of the district around the city of _Xeres_ de la Frontera,\r\nin Andalusia. The vineyards of that district are, in situations\r\ncorresponding in temperature with the most extreme southern parts of\r\nEast Florida and Louisiana. It is interesting to our inquiry, that\r\nall the Portuguese European wines are produced in situations north\r\nof Xeres, such as those called by us the Lisbon, the Careavella,\r\nthe red and the white Port, or Oporto. It is observable, also, that\r\nthe Malaga, or sweet and dry mountain wines of Spain, long highly\r\nesteemed by medical men, those of Alicante and Catalonia, which\r\nthree kinds we principally import, and all the Spanish brandies\r\nwe consume, come from districts as far north as that of Xeres.\r\nThe wines of Castile, and other interior districts of Spain which\r\nare consumed at home, and are not exported, are from places also\r\nnorth of Xeres. We can have no reason to doubt, then, that, as our\r\ncountry now is, and shall in future be cleared and drained, and if\r\nridges, hills, and mountain sides, with south exposures, shall be\r\ncarefully selected, the most southern of our states, territories,\r\nand districts, will be as suitable for the vine, its wines, and\r\ndried fruits, as the most proper and fruitful parts of the peninsula\r\nof Spain and Portugal. The works of travellers, agriculturists,\r\nand men of distinction in the arts and sciences, upon the subject\r\nof the vine, and wines, and dried grapes of Spain and Portugal,\r\nare therefore strongly recommended, by our best interests, to the\r\nattention of our citizens, especially concerning the vineyards of\r\n_Xeres_, St. Lucar, Malaga, and Oporto. The Portuguese send to us no\r\nbrandy; the Spaniards a little of that spirit which is not estimated\r\nas good. It seems, from the excellence of the French _Cognac_\r\nbrandy, the best, and the farthest north of any denomination of\r\nbrandy which we know, that the extreme south is not the most\r\nfavourable for the delicacy, though it is for the quantity of that\r\nspirit. The _Cette_ brandy of France is not liked here, but it has\r\nbeen said that much Armagnac brandy is used in Paris. The celebrated\r\nFrench chemist[21] of the grape and of distilled and fermented wine\r\nspirits, was a native of Montpelier, and took very great pains to\r\nimprove the vine, and all its liquors, in that southern region.\r\n\r\n  _A Friend to the National Industry._\r\n  PHILADELPHIA, NOV. 1, 1819.\r\n\r\n  [21] _Chaptal_, whose writings on the subject should be in every\r\n  planter's hands, and in every agricultural and public library.

He saw seven wild\r\ngeese in the river, at which he fired, and hit the gander so as to\r\nbreak his wing. The other geese immediately flew; but the call of\r\nthe gander brought them down again, so that he had the chance of\r\nfiring again, and killed the old goose, and one of the young; the\r\nfour others rose, but the wounded gander by his calls served as\r\na decoy, and they again alighted by him. The third shot crippled\r\nanother.--Mr. T. then took a boat, and from it killed two as they\r\nrose to fly; and soon after shot the seventh. He returned home to\r\nhis breakfast, about nine o'clock, bringing his seven geese, which\r\nweighed about eight pounds each, and produced him above 3 _lbs._ of\r\nfeather.\r\n\r\n  [_Salem Gazette._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Imports of Wool into England._\r\n\r\n  WOOL.\r\n\r\n  AN ACCOUNT OF THE QUANTITY OF WOOL, (SHEEP'S) IMPORTED INTO GREAT BRITAIN,\r\n  IN TEN YEARS; DISTINGUISHING EACH YEAR, AND THE COUNTRIES FROM WHENCE\r\n  IMPORTED.--_From an English Paper._\r\n\r\n  Countries from whence\r\n  imported.                1802.      1803.      1804.      1805.      1806.\r\n                       ------------------------------------------------------\r\n                            lbs.       lbs.       lbs.       lbs.       lbs.\r\n  Denmark & Norway           --      105,956    212,086    445,125     61,783\r\n  Heligoland                 --         --         --         --         --\r\n  Russia                     --         --         --         --        7,567\r\n  Sweden                     --         --         --         --         --\r\n  Poland and Prussia          228      3,532      7,925     25,189     30,767\r\n  Germany                 426,091    238,256     21,628     36,787    683,988\r\n  Holland                 195,843    155,270     63,019     30,244      1,127\r\n  Flanders and France     201,195     54,714       --         --         --\r\n  Portugal & Madeira      495,213    230,430    161,204    200,366    239,945\r\n  Spain and Canaries    5,646,522  4,355,254  6,990,194  6,858,738  5,444,165\r\n  Gibraltar and Malta      25,000    107,876    159,176     41,395     28,216\r\n  Italy and Levant         86,258    437,856    206,426     35,173      8,679\r\n  Ireland, Guernsey        80,754    117,225    242,113    484,929    576,914\r\n    and Jersey\r\n  Asia                       --         --        --         --           245\r\n  Africa                  453,953    163,746      3,360      --          --\r\n  America, North           40,216     26,073      4,939      5,304      1,636\r\n  America, South             --       20,012     86,898     21,649     20,493\r\n          Prize           105,839      4,568     48,175    361,499    168,468\r\n                       ------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Total                 7,749,112  6,020,775  8,157,213  8,546,378  7,333,996\r\n\r\n\r\n  Countries from whence\r\n  imported.                1807.       1808.      1809.      1810.      1811.\r\n                       ------------------------------------------------------\r\n                            lbs.       lbs.       lbs.       lbs.       lbs.\r\n  Denmark & Norway        481,696     11,253     35,523    363,671     12,081\r\n  Heligoland                 --       58,814    246,441     67,311        112\r\n  Russia                    5,211        168        896     32,149       --\r\n  Sweden                     --         --        8,633     15,424        504\r\n  Poland and Prussia         --         --       76,528    123,057       --\r\n  Germany                 192,010      7,549    367,372    711,524     30,165\r\n  Holland                  34,536       --      237,052      2,873       --\r\n  Flanders and France      61,633       --         --         --         --\r\n  Portugal & Madeira      289,067     30,619    969,033  3,018,961  1,790,286\r\n  Spain and Canaries   10,291,316  1,961,750  4,283,674  5,952,407  2,581,262\r\n  Gibraltar and Malta      14,349     78,130    297,445    889,098    210,236\r\n  Italy and Levant          6,992       --       10,244     21,554        780\r\n  Ireland, Guernsey       299,809     75,409     93,341     63,494     10,353\r\n    and Jersey\r\n  Asia                      3,222       --         --          868       --\r\n  Africa                    6,298     10,717      3,320     29,717     11,791\r\n  America, North              406     14,196       --        4,111     20,192\r\n  America, South           61,176     67,193    213,812    116,178     69,323\r\n          Prize            25,205     37,927      3,619     23,837      2,551\r\n                       ------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Total                11,768,926  2,353,725  6,845,933 10,936,224  4,739,972\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States transmitted a message to Congress\r\non the 20th of last month, relating to the acts prohibiting the\r\nslave trade, in which he stated that a public vessel was to be sent\r\nto Africa, with two public agents, tools and implements necessary to\r\nform a settlement, and thereby give relief and support to the people\r\nof colour who may be captured on board of slave ships and returned\r\nthither.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Denmark much confusion is stated to prevail, on account of the\r\nJews, particularly at Copenhagen.

Soon after the inoculation,\r\nthe patients experienced some slight attacks, and little sores broke\r\nout on them; but in a few days they were all restored to health.\r\nThese experiments are calculated to induce a belief that inoculation\r\nfor the plague may prove as beneficial as it has for the small pox.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mechanics of Ontario county, (N.

The name of\r\nBoerhaave is regarded as the most illustrious in the annals of\r\nmodern medicine. After having courageously withstood the evils of\r\npoverty in his youth, his talents and reputation enabled him, it\r\nis said, to realize a property of two millions of florins, which\r\nhe left to an only daughter. Let us see whether his wealth had not\r\nchanged his occupations and taste.\r\n\r\nIn a letter, written in his 67th year, to his old pupil Bassand,\r\nthen appointed Physician to the Emperor of Germany, he speaks thus\r\nof himself:\r\n\r\n\"My health is very good--I sleep at my country house, and return to\r\ntown at five in the morning; I am engaged till six in the evening\r\nin visiting the sick. I know something of chemistry--I amuse myself\r\nwith reading--I revere, I love, I adore God alone. On my return\r\nto the country, I visit my plants--and gratefully acknowledge and\r\nadmire the liberal presents of my friend Bassend. My garden appears\r\nproud of the variety and vigour of its trees. I waste my life in\r\ncontemplating my plants, and grow old with the desire of possessing\r\nnew ones--Pleasing delusion! who will give me the large-leaved\r\nlinden tree of Bohemia, and that of Silicia, more extraordinary,\r\nwith _folio cucullato_. Thus riches serve only to increase the\r\nthirst for wealth, and the covetous man abuses the liberality of his\r\nbenefactor. Pardon the dotage of an old friend, who wishes to plant\r\ntrees, the beauty and shade of which can charm only his nephews.\r\nThus my years glide on without any chagrin, but that of your\r\nabsence.\"\r\n\r\nHow much is there in these few lines! what activity, what zeal for\r\nsuffering humanity, what piety; what innocence and vivacity in his\r\ntaste, at an age when they are nearly extinct in most men.\r\n\r\n  [_Literary Panorama._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Mummies._\r\n\r\nUnder the mountains adjoining Kiow, on the frontiers of Russia and\r\nin the deserts of Podolia, are several catacombs or subterranean\r\nvaults, which the ancients used for burying places, and where a\r\ngreat number of human bodies are still preserved entire, though\r\ninterred many ages since, having been better embalmed, and become\r\nneither so hard nor so black as the Egyptian mummies. Among them are\r\ntwo princes in the habits they used to wear. It is thought that this\r\npreserving quality is owing to the nature of the soil, which is dry\r\nand sandy.\r\n\r\n  [_London Paper._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA correspondent, who observed some time since a publication\r\nrelative to the extraction of oil from pumpkin seeds, has recently,\r\nfrom curiosity, made an experiment of the same on a very limited\r\nscale. He assures us, the extract obtained, is of equal flavour\r\nand sweetness with the best of olive oil. Our correspondent is of\r\nopinion, that the publication alluded to above, originated with\r\nthe \"Harmony Society,\" in the state of Pennsylvania; and if so, is\r\ndesirous of knowing the best method in practice for extracting the\r\noil from the seed.\r\n\r\n  [_Bost. Pat._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are few sentiments stronger, or more natural to the human\r\nheart, than that of indignation at oppression. So predominant is\r\nit, that it is to be found, not with the good and virtuous only,\r\nbut even amongst the most unprincipled and vicious. If there is any\r\nthing that addresses itself to all that is generous in the heart, it\r\nis this sentiment. What is more, it is the solemn duty of every man,\r\nto set his face against injustice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_New Invention._\r\n\r\nWe understand a patent has lately been taken out, by a gentleman\r\nfrom Massachusetts, for an invention which seems to promise\r\nextensive, advantage to navigation, if once fairly brought into\r\noperation. It consists, principally, in a new method for _sub-marine\r\nploughing_, to any necessary depth, by the power of a steam boat.\r\nWhen the matter is effectually loosened up and pulverized, it cannot\r\nreasonably be doubted but the rapidity of ebb-tides, united with the\r\nnatural current of the rivers, will soon carry it off, and keep the\r\nchannel open. The inventor is now in this city, giving a perspicuous\r\nview of his plan, which appears uncommonly simple and practicable.\r\nThe advantages of being able to plough open channels through the\r\nshoals which so frequently form in many of our immense rivers,\r\nwould, alone, be an object of very great advantage to our southern\r\nand western states; but, when we consider the invention as extending\r\nto opening channels for large ships to enter the harbours and rivers\r\nthroughout our whole sea-board, the advantages presented to view are\r\nincalculable.\r\n\r\n  [_Nat.

Jan. 5th._\r\n\r\nSaturday about noon two very brilliant PARHELIA, (or Mock Suns[22])\r\nand beautiful CORONA, attracted the attention of numerous\r\nspectators. Mock Suns were equidistant from the Sun (by conjecture\r\nabout 20° East and West of it) with _comas_, or tails, extending\r\nin opposite directions from the luminary five or six times their\r\ndiameter, which appeared to the eye a little less than the apparent\r\ndiameter of the Sun. The Corona was estimated to be about 30° to the\r\nnorthward of the Sun, and nearly in our zenith, and exhibited all\r\nthe bright colours of the rainbow, the inside next the Sun being\r\nred. The colour of the Parhelia was orange colour of white flame.\r\nThe Corona formed an are of about a quarter of a circle; and between\r\nit and the Sun was a segment less brilliant and defined.\r\n\r\n  [22] Sailors, we believe, call them _dog suns_.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was unusually clear, and the space between the\r\nMock Suns, and the real Sun, was a perfect blue expanse, without\r\nthe least appearance of the vapour and spicula which must have\r\noccasioned the phenomena. We noticed them nearly an hour, when they\r\ngradually disappeared, leaving a cloudless sky. The phenomena was\r\nobserved at Salem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A curiosity._--It is stated in an English paper of Nov. 12th, that\r\nMr. Creswick, of New Street, Birmingham, has a singular article of\r\ncutlery in his possession, viz: a knife which contains 400 _blades_,\r\nand which, before it was put together, consisted of 5000 _parts_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Public libraries of Germany._\r\n\r\nThe royal library of Munich contains a collection of 400,000\r\nvolumes.

The library of\r\nWolfenbuttel is particularly celebrated for its valuable collection\r\nof ancient works; it contains 190,000 printed volumes, 10,000\r\ndissertations, and 4000 manuscripts. Among the 182,000 volumes which\r\ncompose the library of Stutgard, there are 12,000 different editions\r\nof the Bible. There are seven public libraries in Berlin; the two\r\nprincipal ones are the royal library and the library of the academy;\r\nthe former contains 160,000 volumes, and the latter 30,000.
