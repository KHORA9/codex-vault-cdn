Succeeding impressions were even more\r\ndisconcerting. It seemed that he had also gone to bed with his clothes\r\non; that the bed was unaccountably hard; that the pillow had borrowed\r\nthe characteristics of a pillory.\r\n\r\nSitting up to give these chaotic conclusions a chance to clarify\r\nthemselves, he was still more bewildered. That which had figured as the\r\nblaze of the neglected electrics resolved itself into the morning sun\r\nreflecting dazzlement from the dimpled surface of a woodland lake. The\r\nhard bed proved to be a sandy beach; the pillory pillow a gnarled and\r\ntwisted tree root which had given him a crick in his neck.\r\n\r\nWhen he put his hand to the cramped neck muscle and moved to escape the\r\nbedazzling sun reflection, the changed point of view gave him a shock.\r\nSitting with her back to a tree at a little distance was a strange young\r\nwoman--strange in the sense that he was sure he had never seen her\r\nbefore. Like himself, she had evidently just awakened, and she was\r\nstaring at him out of wide-open, slate-gray eyes. In the eyes he saw a\r\nvast bewilderment comparable to his own, something of alarm, and a trace\r\nof subconscious embarrassment as she put her hands to her hair, which\r\nwas sadly tumbled.\r\n\r\nPrime scrambled to his feet and said, \"Good morning\"--merely because the\r\nconventions, in whatever surroundings, die hard. At this the young woman\r\ngot up, too, patting and pinning the rebellious hair into subjection.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning,\" she returned, quite calmly; and then: \"If you--if you\r\nlive here, perhaps you will be good enough to tell me where I am.\"\r\n\r\nPrime checked a smile. \"You beat me to it,\" he countered affably. \"I was\r\nabout to ask you if you could tell me where _I_ am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know where you are?\" she demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Only relatively; this charming sylvan environment is doubtless\r\nsomewhere in America, but, as to the precise spot, I assure you I have\r\nno more idea than the man in the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a dream--it must be!\" the young woman protested gropingly. \"Last\r\nnight I was in a city--in Quebec.\"\r\n\r\n\"So was I,\" was the prompt rejoinder. Then he felt for his watch,\r\nsaying: \"Wait a moment, let's see if it really was last night.\"\r\n\r\nShe waited; and then--\"Was it?\" she inquired eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it must have been; my watch is still running.\"\r\n\r\nShe put her hand to her head. \"I can't seem to think very clearly. If we\r\nwere in Quebec last night, we can't be so very far from Quebec this\r\nmorning. Can't you--don't you recognize this place at all?\"\r\n\r\nPrime took his first comprehensive survey of the surroundings. So far as\r\ncould be seen there was nothing but the lake, with its farther shore\r\ndimly visible, and the primeval forest of pine, spruce, fir, and ghostly\r\nbirch--a forest all-enveloping, shadowy, and rather forbidding, even\r\nwith the summer morning sunlight playing upon it.\r\n\r\n\"It looks as if we might be a long way from Quebec,\" he ventured. \"I am\r\nnot very familiar with the Provinces, but these woods----\"\r\n\r\nShe interrupted him anxiously. \"A long way? How could it be--in a single\r\nnight?\" Then: \"You are giving me to understand that you are not--that\r\nyou don't know how we come to be here?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must believe that, if you can't believe anything else,\" he hastened\r\nto say. \"I don't know where we are, or how we got here, or why we should\r\nbe here. In other words, I am not the kidnapper; I'm the kidnapped--or\r\nat least half of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems as if it _must_ be a bad dream,\" she returned, with the frown\r\nof perplexity growing between the pretty eyes. \"Things like this don't\r\nreally happen, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know they don't, as a rule. I've tried to make them happen, now and\r\nthen, on paper, but they always seem to lack a good bit in the way of\r\nverisimilitude.\"\r\n\r\nThe young woman turned away to walk down to the lake edge, where she\r\nknelt and washed her face and hands, drying them afterward on her\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" she asked, coming back to him, \"have you thought of anything\r\nyet?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \"Honestly, I haven't anything left to think with.\r\nThat part of my mind has basely escaped. But I have found something,\"\r\nand he pointed to a little heap of provisions and utensils piled at the\r\nupper edge of the sand belt: a flitch of bacon, sewn in canvas, a tiny\r\nsack of flour, a few cans of tinned things, matches, a camper's\r\nfrying-pan, and a small coffee-pot. \"Whoever brought us here didn't mean\r\nthat we should starve for a day or two, at least. Shall we breakfast\r\nfirst and investigate afterward?\"\r\n\r\n\"'We?'\" she said. \"Can you cook?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so that any one would notice it,\" he laughed. \"Can you?\"\r\n\r\nShe matched the laugh, and it relieved him mightily. It was her\r\nundoubted right as a woman to cry out, or faint, or be foolishly\r\nhysterical if she chose; the circumstances certainly warranted\r\nanything. But she was apparently waiving her privilege.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I ought to be able to cook. When I am at home I teach domestic\r\nscience in a girls' school. Will you make a fire?\"\r\n\r\nPrime bestirred himself like a seasoned camper--which was as far as\r\npossible from being the fact. There was plenty of dry wood at hand, and\r\na bit of stripped birch bark answered for kindling. The young woman\r\nremoved her coat and pulled up her sleeves. Prime cut the bacon with his\r\npocket-knife, and, much to the detriment of the same implement, opened a\r\ncan of peaches. For the bread, Domestic Science wrestled heroically with\r\na lack of appliances; the batter had to be stirred in the tiny skillet\r\nwith water taken from the lake.\r\n\r\nThe cooking was also difficult. Being strictly city-bred, neither of\r\nthem knew enough to let the fire burn down to coals, and they tried to\r\nbake the pan-bread over the flames. The result was rather smoky and\r\nsaddening, and the young woman felt called upon to apologize. But the\r\npeaches, fished out of the tin with a sharpened birch twig for a fork,\r\nwere good, and so was the bacon; and for sauce there was a fair degree\r\nof outdoor hunger. Over the breakfast they plunged once more into the\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\n\"Let us try it by the process of elimination,\" Prime suggested. \"First,\r\nlet me see if I can cancel myself. When I am at home in New York my name\r\nis Donald Prime, and I am a perfectly harmless writer of stories. The\r\neditors are the only people who really hate me, and you could hardly\r\ncharge this\"--with an arm-wave to include the surrounding\r\nwilderness--\"to the vindictiveness of an editor, could you?\"\r\n\r\nHe wished to make her laugh again, and he succeeded--in spite of the sad\r\npan-bread.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you have been muck-raking somebody in your stories,\" she\r\nremarked. \"But that wouldn't include me. I am even more harmless than\r\nyou are. My worst enemies are frivolous girls from well-to-do families\r\nwho think it beneath them to learn to cook scientifically.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a joke,\" Prime offered soberly; \"it can't be anything else.\" Then:\r\n\"If we only knew what is expected of us, so that we could play up to\r\nour part. What is the last thing you remember--in Quebec?\"\r\n\r\n\"The most commonplace thing in the world. I am, or I was, a member of a\r\nvacation excursion party of school-teachers. Last evening at the hotel\r\nsomebody proposed that we go to the Heights of Abraham and see the old\r\nbattle-field by moonlight.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you did it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. After we had tramped all over the place, one of the young women\r\nasked me if I wouldn't like to go with her to the head of the cove where\r\nGeneral Wolfe and his men climbed up from the river. We went together,\r\nand while we were there the young woman stumbled and fell and turned her\r\nankle--or at least she said she did. I took her arm to help her back to\r\nthe others, and in a little while I began to feel so tired and sleepy\r\nthat I simply couldn't drag myself another step. That is the last that I\r\nremember.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell quite such a straight story,\" said Prime, taking his turn,\r\n\"but at any rate I shan't begin by telling you a lie. I'm afraid I\r\nwas--er--drunk, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" she commanded, as one who would know the worst.\r\n\r\n\"I, too, was on my vacation,\" he went on. \"I was to meet a friend of\r\nmine in Boston, and we were to motor together through New England. At\r\nthe last moment I had a telegram from this friend changing the plan and\r\nasking me to meet him in Quebec. I arrived a day or so ahead of him, I\r\nsuppose; at least, he wasn't at the hotel where he said he'd be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" she encouraged.\r\n\r\n\"I had been there a day and a night, waiting, and, since I didn't know\r\nany one in Quebec, it was becoming rather tiresome. Last evening at\r\ndinner I happened to sit in with a big, two-fisted young fellow who\r\nconfessed that he was in the same boat--waiting for somebody to turn up.\r\nAfter dinner we went out together and made a round of the movies, with\r\nthree or four cafes sandwiched in between. I drank a little, just to be\r\nfriendly with the chap, and the next thing I knew I was trying to go to\r\nsleep over one of the cafe tables. I seem to remember that my chance\r\nacquaintance got me up and headed me for the hotel; but after that it's\r\nall a blank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you know any better than to drink with a total stranger?\" the\r\nyoung woman asked crisply.\r\n\r\n\"Apparently I didn't. But the three or four thimblefuls of cheap wine\r\noughtn't to have knocked me out. It was awful stuff; worse than the _vin\r\nordinaire_ they feed you in the Paris wine-shops.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems rather suspicious, doesn't it?\" she mused; \"your sudden\r\nsleepiness? Are you--are you used to drinking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tea,\" he laughed; \"I'm a perfect inebriate with a teapot.\"\r\n\r\n\"There must be an explanation of some sort,\" she insisted. Then: \"Can\r\nyou climb a tree?\"\r\n\r\nHe got up and dusted the sand from his clothes.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't done it since I used to pick apples in my grandfather's\r\norchard at Batavia, but I'll try,\" and he left her to go in search of a\r\ntree tall enough to serve for an outlook.\r\n\r\nThe young woman had the two kitchen utensils washed and sand-scoured by\r\nthe time he came back.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\n\"A wild and woolly wilderness,\" he reported; \"just a trifle more of it\r\nthan you can see from here. The lake is five or six miles wide and\r\nperhaps twice as long. There are low hills to the north and woods\r\neverywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no houses or anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing; for all I could see, we might be the only two human beings on\r\nthe face of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be quite cheerful about it,\" she retorted.\r\n\r\nHe grinned good-naturedly. \"That is a matter of temperament. I'd be\r\ngrouchy enough if it would do any good. I shall lose my motor trip\r\nthrough New England.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think--think hard!\" the young woman pleaded. \"Since there is no sign of\r\na road, we must have come in a boat; in that case we can't be very far\r\nfrom Quebec. Surely there must be some one living on the shore of a lake\r\nas big as this. We must walk until we find a house.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll do anything you say,\" Prime agreed; and they set out together,\r\nfollowing the lake shore to the left, chiefly because the beach\r\nbroadened in that direction and so afforded easy walking.\r\n\r\nA tramp of a mile northward scarcely served to change the point of view.\r\nThere was no break in the encircling forest, and at the end of the mile\r\nthey came to a deeply indented bay, where the continuing shore was in\r\nplain view for a doubling of another mile. The search for inhabitants\r\nseeming to promise nothing in this direction, they turned and retraced\r\ntheir steps to the breakfast camp, still puzzling over the tangle of\r\nmysteries.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you think of _any_ way of accounting for it?\" the young woman\r\nurged for the twentieth time in the puzzlings.\r\n\r\n\"I can think of a million ways--all of them blankly impossible,\" said\r\nPrime. \"It's simply a chaotic joke!\"\r\n\r\nThe young woman shook her head. \"I have lost my sense of humor,\" she\r\nconfessed, adding: \"I shall go stark, staring mad if we can't find out\r\nsomething!\"\r\n\r\nMore to keep things from going from bad to worse than for any other\r\nreason, Prime suggested a walk in the opposite direction--southward from\r\nthe breakfast camp. While they were still within sight of the ashes of\r\nthe breakfast fire they made a discovery. The loose beach sand was\r\ntracked back and forth, and in one place there were scorings as if some\r\nheavy body had been dragged. Just beyond the footprints there were wheel\r\ntracks, beginning abruptly and ending in the same manner a hundred yards\r\nfarther along. The wheel tracks were parallel but widely separated,\r\nill-defined in the loose sand but easily traceable.\r\n\r\n\"A wagon?\" questioned the young woman.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Prime soberly; \"it was--er--it looks as if it might have been\r\nan aeroplane.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                           AMATEUR CASTAWAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCETTA MILLINGTON--she had told Prime her name on the tramp to the\r\nnorthward--sat down in the sand, elbows on knees and her chin propped in\r\nher hands.\r\n\r\n\"You say 'aeroplane' as if it suggested something familiar to you, Mr.\r\nPrime,\" she prompted.\r\n\r\nTruly it did suggest something to Prime, and for a moment his mouth went\r\ndry. Grider, the man he was to have met in Quebec, was a college\r\nclassmate, a harebrained young barbarian, rich, an outdoor fanatic, an\r\nowner of fast yachts, a driver of fast cars, and latterly a dabbler in\r\naviatics. Idle enough to be full of extravagant fads and fancies, and\r\nwealthy enough to indulge them, this young barbarian made friends of his\r\nenemies and enemies of his friends with equal facility--the latter\r\nchiefly through the medium of conscienceless practical jokes evolved\r\nfrom a Homeric sense of humor too ruthless to be appreciated by mere\r\ntwentieth-century weaklings.\r\n\r\nPrime had more than once been the good-natured victim of these jokes,\r\nand his heart sank within him. It was plain now that they had both been\r\nconveyed to this outlandish wilderness in an aircraft of some sort, and\r\nthere was little doubt in his mind that Grider had been at the controls.\r\n\r\n\"It's a--it's a joke, just as I have been trying to tell you,\" he\r\nfaltered at length. \"We have been kidnapped, and I'm awfully afraid I\r\nknow the man who did it,\" and thereupon he gave her a rapid-fire sketch\r\nof Grider and Grider's wholly barbarous and irresponsible proclivities.\r\n\r\nMiss Millington heard him through without comment, still with her chin\r\nin her hands.\r\n\r\n\"You are standing there and telling me calmly that he did this--this\r\nunspeakable thing?\" she exclaimed when the tale was told. Then, after a\r\nmomentary pause: \"I am trying to imagine the kind of man who could be so\r\nferociously inhuman. Frankly, I can't, Mr. Prime.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I fancy you can't; I couldn't imagine him myself, and I earn my\r\nliving by imagining people--and things. Grider is in a class by himself.\r\nI have always told him that he was born about two thousand years too\r\nlate. Back in the time of Julius Caesar, now, they might have appreciated\r\nhis classic sense of humor.\"\r\n\r\nHe stole a glance at the impassive face framed between the supporting\r\npalms. It was evident that Miss Millington was freezing silently in a\r\nheroic effort to restrain herself from bursting into flames of angry\r\nresentment.\r\n\r\n\"You may enjoy having such a man for your friend,\" she suggested with\r\nchilling emphasis, \"but I think there are not very many people who would\r\ncare to share him with you. Perhaps you have done something to earn the\r\nconsequences of this wretched joke, but I am sure _I_ haven't. Why\r\nshould he include me?\"\r\n\r\nPrime suspected that he knew this, too, and he had to summon all his\r\nreserves of fortitude before he could bring himself to the point of\r\ntelling her. Yet it was her due.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you will think of me, Miss Millington, but I guess\r\nthe truth ought to be told. Grider has always ragged me about my\r\nwomen--er--that is, the women in my stories, I mean. He says they are\r\nall alike, and all sticks; merely wooden manikins--womanikins, he calls\r\nthem--upon which to hang an evening gown. I shouldn't wonder if it were\r\npartly true; I don't know women very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" she commanded.\r\n\r\n\"The last time I was with Grider--it was about two weeks ago--he was\r\nparticularly obnoxious about the girl in my last bit of stuff--the story\r\nthat was printed in the _New Era_ last month. He said--er--he said I\r\nought to be marooned on some desert island with a woman; that after an\r\nexperience of that kind I might be able to draw something that wouldn't\r\nbe a mere caricature of the sex.\"\r\n\r\nAt this, as was most natural, Miss Millington's ice melted in a sudden\r\nand uncontrollable blaze of indignation.\r\n\r\n\"Are you trying to tell me that this atrocious friend of yours has taken\r\n_me_, a total stranger, to complete his cast of characters in this\r\nwretched burlesque?\" she flashed out.\r\n\r\n\"I don't wish to believe it,\" he protested. \"It doesn't seem possible\r\nfor any human being to do such a thing. But I know Grider so well----\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the smallest possible credit to you, Mr. Prime,\" she snapped.\r\n\"You ought to be ashamed to have such a man for a friend!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" he acceded, humbly enough. \"Grider weighs about fifty pounds\r\nmore than I do, and he took three initials in athletics in the\r\nuniversity. But I pledge you my word I shall beat him to a frazzle for\r\nthis when I get the chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"A lot of good that does us now!\" scoffed the poor victim. And then she\r\ngot up and walked away, leaving him to stand gazing abstractedly at the\r\nwheel tracks of the kidnapping air-machine.\r\n\r\nHaving lived the unexciting life of a would-be man of letters, Prime had\r\nhad none of the strenuous experiences which might have served to preface\r\na situation such as this in which he found himself struggling like a\r\nfly in a web. It was absurdly, ridiculously impossible, and yet it\r\nexisted as a situation to be met and dealt with. Watching the indignant\r\nyoung woman furtively, he saw that she went back to sit down beside the\r\nashes of the breakfast fire, again with her chin in her hands. Meaning\r\nto be cautiously prudent, he rolled and smoked a cigarette before\r\nventuring to rejoin her, hoping that the lapse of time might clear the\r\nair a little.\r\n\r\nShe was staring aimlessly at the dimpled surface of the lake when he\r\ncame up and took his place on the opposite side of the ashes. The little\r\nheap of provisions gave him an idea and an opening, but she struck in\r\nahead of him.\r\n\r\n\"Let me know when you expect me to pose for you,\" she said without\r\nturning her head.\r\n\r\n\"I was an idiot to tell you that!\" he exploded. \"Can't you understand\r\nthat that fool suggestion about the desert island and a--er--a woman was\r\nGrider's and not mine? How could I know that he would ever be criminal\r\nenough to turn it into a fact?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if you can call it criminal, and really mean it--\" she threw out.\r\n\r\n\"I'll call it anything in the vocabulary if only you won't quarrel with\r\nme. Goodness knows, things are bad enough without that!\"\r\n\r\nShe let him see a little more of her face. The frown had disappeared,\r\nand there were signs that the storm of indignation was passing.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it isn't a particle of use to quarrel,\" she admitted. \"What\r\nis done is done and can't be helped, however much we may agree to\r\ndespise your barbarous friend, Mr. Grider. How is it all going to end?\"\r\n\r\nAt this Prime aired his small idea. \"Our provisions won't last more than\r\na day or two; they were evidently not intended to. If that means\r\nanything, it means that Grider will come back for us before long. He\r\ncertainly can't do less.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us hope so. Have you ever camped out in the woods before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither have I. What I don't know about woodcraft would make a much\r\nlarger book than any I ever hope to write. You probably guessed that\r\nwhen you saw me make the fire.\"\r\n\r\nThe corners of the pretty mouth were twitching. \"And you probably\r\nguessed my part of it when you saw me try to make that dreadful\r\npan-bread. I _can_ cook; really I can, Mr. Prime; but when one has been\r\nused to having everything imaginable to do it with----\"\r\n\r\nPrime thought he might venture to laugh once more. \"Your revenge is in\r\nyour own hands; all you have to do is to continue to make the bread.\r\nIt'll get me in time. My digestion isn't particularly good, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think we shall be rescued soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the sake of my own sanity, I'm obliged to think it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in the meantime we must sit here and wait?\"\r\n\r\n\"We needn't make the waiting any harder than we are obliged to. Suppose\r\nwe call it a--er--a sort of surprise-party picnic. I imagine it is no\r\nuse for us to try to escape. Grider probably picked the lonesomest\r\nplace he knew of.\"\r\n\r\nShe fell in with the idea rather more readily than he could have hoped,\r\nand it gave him a freshening interest in her. The women he knew best\r\nwere not so entirely sensible. During what remained of the forenoon they\r\nrambled together in the forest, care-free for the moment and postponing\r\nthe evil day. In such circumstances their acquaintance grew by leaps and\r\nbounds, and when they came back to make a renewed attack upon the\r\nprovisions, the picnic spirit was still in the saddle.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was spent in much the same manner; and in the absence of\r\nthe conventional restraints, a good many harmless confidences were\r\nexchanged. Before the day was ended the young woman had heard the moving\r\nstory of Prime's struggle for a foothold in the field of letters, a\r\nstruggle which, he was modest enough to say, was still in the making;\r\nand in return she had given her own story, which was commonplace\r\nenough--so many years of school, so many in a Middle Western\r\ncoeducational college, two more of them as a teacher in the girls'\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\"Humdrum, isn't it?\" she said. They had made the evening fire, and she\r\nwas trying to cook two vegetables and the inevitable pan-bread in the\r\none small skillet. \"This is my first real adventure. I wish I might know\r\nwhether I dare enjoy it as much as I'd like to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the conventions, I suppose. We can't run fast enough or far enough\r\nto get away from them. I am wondering what the senior faculty would say\r\nif it could see me just now.\"\r\n\r\nPrime grinned appreciatively. \"It would probably shriek and expire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Happily it can't see; and to-morrow--surely Mr. Grider will come back\r\nfor us to-morrow, won't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are going to sleep soundly in that comforting belief, anyway. Which\r\nreminds me: you will have to have some sort of a place to sleep in. Why\r\ndidn't I think of that before dark?\"\r\n\r\nImmediately after supper, and before he would permit himself to roll a\r\ncigarette from the diminishing supply of precious tobacco, Prime fell\r\nupon his problem, immensely willing but prodigiously inexperienced. At\r\nfirst he thought he would build a shack, but the lack of an axe put that\r\nout of the question. Round by round, ambition descended the ladder of\r\nnecessity, and the result was nothing better than a camper's bed of\r\nbroken pine twigs sheltered and housed in by a sort of bower built from\r\nsuch tree branches as he could break off by main strength.\r\n\r\nThe young woman did not withhold her meed of praise, especially after\r\nshe had seen his blistered hands, which were also well daubed with pitch\r\nfrom the pines.\r\n\r\n\"It's a shame!\" she said. \"I ought not to have let you work so hard. If\r\nit should happen to rain, you'd need the shelter much more than I\r\nshould.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you say that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't look so very fit,\" was the calm reply; \"and I _am_ fit. Do\r\nyou know, my one ambition, as a little girl, was to grow up and be an\r\nacrobat in a circus?\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet you landed in the laboratory of a girls' school,\" he laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Not exclusively,\" she countered quickly. \"Last year I was also an\r\nassistant in the gymnasium. Swimming was my specialty, but I taught\r\nother things as well.\"\r\n\r\nPrime laughed again. \"And I can't swim a single stroke,\" he confessed.\r\n\"Isn't that a humiliating admission on the part of a man who has lived\r\nthe greater part of his life in sight of the ocean?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Millington said she thought it was, and in such gladsome fashion\r\nthe evening wore away. When it came time to sleep, the lately risen moon\r\nlighted the young woman to her bower; and Prime, replenishing the fire,\r\nmade his bed in the sand, the unwonted exertions of the day and evening\r\nputting him to sleep before he had fairly fitted himself to the\r\ninequalities of his burrow below the tree roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                             SENSIBLE SHOES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE dawn of the second morning was much like that of the first, cool and\r\ncrystal clear, and with the sun beating out a pathway of molten gold\r\nacross the mirror-like surface of the solitary lake.\r\n\r\nPrime bestirred himself early, meaning to get the breakfast under way\r\nsingle-handed while Miss Millington slept. But the young woman who had\r\ndescribed herself as being \"fit\" had stolen a march upon him. He was\r\nfrying the bacon when she came skimming up the beach with her hair\r\nflying.\r\n\r\n\"I got up early and didn't want to disturb you,\" she told him. \"There is\r\na splendid swimming place just around that point; I don't know when I've\r\nenjoyed a dip more. Wouldn't you like to try it while I dry my hair and\r\nmake some more of the homicidal bread?\"\r\n\r\nPrime went obediently and took the required bath, finding the water\r\nbracingly cold and scarcely shallow enough to be reassuring to a\r\nnon-swimmer. Over the breakfast which followed, the picnic spirit still\r\npresided, though by now it was beginning to lose a little of the lilt.\r\nFor one thing, the bacon and the pan-bread, though they were ameliorated\r\nsomewhat by the tinned things, were growing a trifle monotonous; for\r\nanother, the limitless expanse of lake and sky and forest gave forth no\r\nsign of the hoped-for rescue.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they made a careful calculation to determine how long\r\ntheir provisions would last. This, too, was unhopeful. With reasonable\r\neconomy they might eat through another day. Beyond that lay a chance of\r\nfamine.\r\n\r\n\"Surely Grider will come back for us to-day,\" Prime asserted when\r\nDomestic Science had done its best in apportioning the supplies. But at\r\nthis the young woman shook her head doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I have had time to think,\" she announced. \"It is all a guess, you\r\nknow--this about Mr. Grider--and the more I think of it the more\r\nincredible it seems. Consider a moment. To make the kidnapping possible\r\nwe must both have been drugged. That is a serious matter--too serious to\r\nhave a part in the programme of the most reckless practical joker.\"\r\n\r\nPrime looked up quickly. \"I might have been drugged very easily. But\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nThe young woman bared a rounded arm to show a minute red dot half-way\r\nbetween wrist and elbow. \"I told you about the young woman who stumbled\r\nand turned her ankle: when I took hold of her to help her, something\r\npricked my arm. She said it was a pin in the sleeve of her coat and\r\napologized for having been so careless as to leave it there.\"\r\n\r\nPrime looked closely at the red dot.\r\n\r\n\"A hypodermic needle?\" he suggested.\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \"That is why I became so sleepy. And your potion was put in\r\nthe wine, which you say tasted so bad.\"\r\n\r\nPrime admitted the deduction without prejudice to his belief that Grider\r\nwas the arch-plotter, saying: \"Grider is quite capable of anything, if\r\nthe notion appealed to him. And, of course, he must have had hired\r\nconfederates; he couldn't manage it all alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still,\" she urged, \"it seems to me that we ought to be trying to help\r\nourselves in some way. It doesn't seem defensible just to sit here and\r\nwait, on the chance that your guess is going to prove true.\"\r\n\r\nPrime laughed. \"You are always and most eminently logical. Where shall\r\nwe begin?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the geography end of it,\" she replied calmly. \"How far could an\r\naeroplane fly in a single night?\"\r\n\r\nPrime took time to think about it. He had never had occasion to use a\r\nlong aeroplane flight in any of his stories; hence the special\r\ninformation was lacking. But common sense and a few figures helped\r\nout--so many hours, so many miles an hour, total distance so much.\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred miles, let us say, as an extreme limit,\" he estimated, and\r\nat this the young woman gave a faint little shriek.\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred miles! Why, that is as far as from Cincinnati to Lake Erie!\r\nSurely we can't be that far from Quebec!\"\r\n\r\n\"I merely mentioned that distance as the limit. We are evidently\r\nsomewhere deep in the northern woods. I don't know much about the\r\ngeography of this region--never having had to stage a story in it--but a\r\nlake of this size, with miles of marketable timber on its shores, argues\r\none of two things: it is too far from civilization to have yet tempted\r\nthe lumbermen, or else it has no outlet large enough to admit of logging\r\noperations. You may take your choice.\"\r\n\r\n\"But two hundred miles!\" she gasped. \"If some one doesn't come after us,\r\nwe shall _never_ get out alive!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is why I think we ought to wait,\" said Prime quietly.\r\n\r\nSo they did wait throughout the entire forenoon, sitting for the most\r\npart under the shade of the shore trees, killing time and talking\r\nlight-heartedly against the grim conclusion that each passing hour was\r\nforcing upon them. They contrived to keep it up to and through the\r\nnoonday _seance_ with the cooking fire; but after that the barriers, on\r\nthe young woman's part, went out with a rush.\r\n\r\n\"I simply can't stand it any longer,\" she protested. \"We must do\r\nsomething, Mr. Prime. We can at least walk somewhere and carry the bits\r\nof provisions along with us. Why should we stay right in this one spot\r\nuntil we starve?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am still clinging to the Grider supposition,\" Prime admitted. \"If we\r\nmove away from here he might not be able to find us.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is only a supposition,\" she countered quickly. \"You accept it, but,\r\nwhile I haven't anything better to offer, I cannot make it seem real.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you throw Grider out of it, it becomes an absolutely impossible\r\nriddle.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know; but everything is impossible. We are awake and alive and lost,\r\nand these are the only facts we can be sure of.\" Then she added: \"It\r\nwill be so much easier to bear if we are only doing something!\"\r\n\r\nPrime had an uncomfortable feeling that a move would be a definite\r\nabandonment of the only reasonable hope; but he had no further argument\r\nto adduce, and the preparations for the move were quickly made. Though\r\nthe young woman was the disbeliever in the Grider hypothesis, it was at\r\nher suggestion that Prime wrote a note on the back of a pocket-worn\r\nletter and left it sticking in a cleft stake by the waterside; the note\r\nadvertising the direction they were about to take. They had no plan\r\nother than to try to find the lake's outlet, and to this end they laid\r\ntheir course southward along the shore, dividing the small \"tote-load\"\r\nof dunnage at the young woman's insistence.\r\n\r\nSo long as they had the sandy lake margin for a path, the going was\r\neasy, but in a little time the beach disappeared in a rocky shore, with\r\nthe forest crowding closely upon the water, and they were forced to make\r\na long circuit inland. Still having the protective instinct, Prime\r\n\"broke trail\" handsomely for his companion, but, since he was something\r\nless than an athlete, the long afternoon of it told upon him severely;\r\nso severely, indeed, that he was glad to throw himself down upon the\r\nsands to rest when they finally came back to the lake on the shore of a\r\nnarrow bay.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know before how much I lacked of being a real man,\" he\r\nadmitted, stretching himself luxuriously upon his back to stare up into\r\nthe sunset sky. Then, as if it had just occurred to him: \"Say--it must\r\nhave been something fierce for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am all right,\" was the cheerful reply. \"But I shall never get over\r\nbeing thankful that I put on a pair of sensible shoes, night before\r\nlast, to walk to the Heights of Abraham.\"\r\n\r\nAfter he had rested and was beginning to grow stiff, Prime sat up.\r\n\r\n\"We can't go much farther before dark; shall we camp here?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe young woman shook her head. \"We can't see anything from here; it is\r\nso shut in. Can't we go on a little farther?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Prime assented, scrambling up and stooping to rub the stiffness\r\nout of his calves, and at this the aimless march was renewed, to end\r\ndefinitely a few minutes later at the intake of a stream flowing\r\nsilently out of the lake to the southeastward; a stream narrow and not\r\ntoo swift, but sufficiently deep to bar their way.\r\n\r\nTwilight was stealing softly through the shadowy aisles of the forest\r\nwhen they prepared to camp at the lake-shore edge of the wood. Prime\r\nmade the camp-fire, and, since the lake water was a little roiled at\r\nthe outlet mouth, he took one of the empty fruit-tins and crossed the\r\nneck of land to the river. Working his way around a thicket of\r\nundergrowth, he came upon the stream at a point where the little river,\r\nas if gathering itself for its long journey to the sea, spread away in a\r\nquiet and almost currentless reach.\r\n\r\nClimbing down the bank to fill the tin, he found a startling surprise\r\nlying in wait for him. Just below the overhanging bank a large\r\nbirch-bark canoe, well filled with dunnage, was drawn out upon a tiny\r\nbeach. His first impulse was to rush back to his companion with the good\r\nnews that their rescue was at hand; the next was possibly a hand-down\r\nfrom some far-away Indian-dodging ancestor: perhaps it would be well\r\nfirst to find out into whose hands they were going to fall.\r\n\r\nThe canoe itself told him nothing, and neither did the lading, which\r\nincluded a good store of eatables. There was an air of isolation about\r\nthe birch-bark which gave him the feeling that it had been beached for\r\nsome time, and the dry paddles lying inside confirmed the impression.\r\nHe listened, momently expecting to hear sounds betraying the presence of\r\nthe owners, but the silence of the sombre forest was unbroken save by\r\nthe lapping of the little wavelets on the near-by lake shore.\r\n\r\nRealizing that Miss Millington would be waiting for her bread-mixing\r\nwater, Prime filled the tin and recrossed the small peninsula.\r\n\r\n\"I was beginning to wonder if you were lost,\" said the bread-maker. \"Did\r\nyou have to go far?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not very far.\" Then, snatching at the first excuse that offered: \"I\r\nsaw some berries on the river-bank. Let me have the tin again and I'll\r\nsee if I can't gather a few before it grows too dark.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus given a plausible reason for a longer absence, he went back\r\nto the canoe to look in the fading light for tracks in the sand. Now\r\nthat he made a business of searching for them, he found plenty of them;\r\nheelless tracks as if the feet that had made them had been shod with\r\nmoccasins. A little farther down the stream-side there were broken\r\nbushes and a small earth-slide to show where somebody had scrambled up\r\nto the forest level. Following the trail he soon found himself in a\r\nnatural clearing, grass-grown and running back from the river a hundred\r\nyards or more. In the centre of this clearing he came upon the ashes of\r\nfive separate fires, disposed in the form of a rude cross.\r\n\r\nStill there was no sign of the canoe-owners themselves, and the\r\ndiscovery of the curiously arranged ash-heaps merely added more mystery\r\nto mystery. The fires had been dead for some time. Of this Prime assured\r\nhimself by thrusting his hand into the ashes. Clearly the camp, if it\r\nwere a camp, had been abandoned for some hours at least. The gathering\r\ndusk warned him that it would be useless to try to track the\r\nfire-makers, and he turned to make his way back to the lake shore and\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nIt was in the edge of the glade, under the gloomy shadow of a giant\r\nspruce, that he stumbled blindly over some reluctantly yielding obstacle\r\nand fell headlong. Regaining his feet quickly with a nameless fear\r\nunnerving him, he stooped and groped under the shadowing tree, drawing\r\nback horror-stricken when his hand came in contact with the stiffened\r\narm of a corpse.\r\n\r\nHe had matches in his pocket, and he found one and lighted it. His hand\r\nshook so that the match went out and he had to light another. By the\r\nbrief flare of the second match he saw a double horror. Lying in a\r\nlittle depression between two spreading roots of the spruce were the\r\nbodies of two men locked in a death-grip. Another match visualized the\r\ntragedy in all its ghastly details. The men were apparently Indians, or\r\nhalf-breeds, and it had been a duel to the death, fought with knives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\n                              IN THE NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIME made his way to the camp-fire at the lake edge, a prey to many\r\ndisturbing emotions. Having lived a life practically void of adventure,\r\nthe sudden collision with bloody tragedy shocked him prodigiously. Out\r\nof the welter of emotions he dug a single fixed and unalterable\r\ndecision. Come what might, his companion must be kept from all knowledge\r\nof the duel and its ghastly outcome.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me! You look as if you had seen a ghost,\" was the way the battle\r\nof concealment was opened when he came within the circle of firelight.\r\n\"Did you find any berries?\"\r\n\r\nPrime shook his head. \"No, it was too dark,\" he said; \"and, anyway, I'm\r\nnot sure there were any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" was the cheerful rejoinder. \"We have enough without them,\r\nand, really, I am beginning to get the knack of the pan-bread. If you\r\ndon't say it is better this evening--\" She broke off suddenly. He had\r\nsat down by the fire and was nursing his knees to keep them from\r\nknocking together. \"Why, what _is_ the matter with you? You are as pale\r\nas a sheet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I stumbled over something and fell down,\" he explained hesitantly.\r\n\"It wasn't much of a fall, but it seemed to shake me up a good bit. I'll\r\nbe all right in a minute or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are simply tired to death,\" she put in sympathetically. \"The long\r\ntramp this afternoon was too much for you.\"\r\n\r\nPrime resented the sympathy. He was not willing to admit that he could\r\nnot endure as much as she could--as much as any mere woman could.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not especially tired,\" he denied; and to prove it he began to eat\r\nas if he were hungry, and to talk, and to make his companion talk, of\r\nthings as far as possible removed from the sombre heart of a Canadian\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nImmediately after supper he began to build another sleeping-shelter,\r\nthough the young woman insisted that it was ridiculous for him to feel\r\nthat he was obliged to do this at every fresh stopping-place. None the\r\nless, he persevered, partly because the work relieved him of the\r\nnecessity of trying to keep up appearances. Fortunately, Miss Millington\r\nconfessed herself weary enough to go to bed early, and after she left\r\nhim Prime sat before the fire, smoking the dust out of his tobacco-pouch\r\nand formulating his plan for the keeping of the horrid secret.\r\n\r\nThe plan was simple enough, asking only for time and a sufficient\r\nquantity--and quality--of nerve. When he could be sure that his\r\ncamp-mate was safely asleep he would go back to the glade and dispose of\r\nthe two dead men in some way so that she would never know of their\r\nexistence alive or dead.\r\n\r\nThe waiting proved to be a terrific strain; the more so since the\r\nconditions were strictly compelling. The chance to secure the ownerless\r\nand well-stocked canoe was by no means to be lost, but Prime saw\r\ndifficulties ahead. His companion would wish to know a lot of things\r\nthat she must not be told, and he was well assured that she would have\r\nto be convinced of their right to take the canoe before she would\r\nconsent to be an accomplice in the taking. This meant delay, which in\r\nits turn rigidly imposed the complete effacement of all traces of the\r\ntragedy. He was waiting to begin the effacement.\r\n\r\nBy the time his tobacco was gone he was quivering with a nervous\r\nimpatience to be up and at it and have it over with. After the crackling\r\nfire died down the forest silence was unbroken. The young woman was\r\nasleep; he could hear her regular breathing. But the time was not yet\r\nripe. The moon had risen, but it was not yet high enough to pour its\r\nrays into the tree-sheltered glade, and without its light to aid him the\r\nhorrible thing he had to do would be still more horrible.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly midnight when he got up from his place beside the\r\nwhitening embers of the camp-fire and pulled himself together for the\r\ngrewsome task. Half-way to the glade a fit of trembling seized him and\r\nhe had to sit down until it passed. It was immensely humiliating, and he\r\nlamented the carefully civilized pre-existence which had left him so\r\nhelplessly unable to cope with the primitive and the unusual.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the glade and the big spruce the moon was shining full\r\nupon the two dead men. One of them had a crooking arm locked around the\r\nneck of the other. Prime's gorge rose when he found that he had to\r\nstrain and tug to break the arm-grip, and he had a creeping shock of\r\nhorror when he discovered that the gripped throat had a gaping wound\r\nthrough which the man's life had fled. In the body of the other man he\r\nfound a retaliatory knife, buried to the haft, and it took all his\r\nstrength to withdraw it.\r\n\r\nWith these unnerving preliminaries fairly over, he went on doggedly,\r\ndragging the bodies one at a time to the river-brink. Selecting the\r\nquietest of the eddies, and making sure of its sufficient depth by\r\nsounding with a broken tree limb, he began a search for\r\nweighting-stones. There were none on the river-bank, and he had to go\r\nback to the lake shore for them, carrying them an armful at a time.\r\n\r\nThe weighting process kept even pace with the other ghastly details.\r\nThe men both wore the belted coats of the northern guides, and he first\r\ntried filling the pockets with stones. When this seemed entirely\r\ninadequate he trudged back to the abandoned canoe and secured a pair of\r\nblankets from its lading. Of these he made a winding-sheet for each of\r\nthe dead men, wrapping the stones in with the bodies, and making all\r\nfast as well as he could with strings fashioned from strips of the\r\nblanketing.\r\n\r\nAll this took time, and before it was finished, with the two stiffened\r\nbodies settling to the bottom of the deep pool, Prime was sick and\r\nshaken. What remained to be done was less distressing. Going back to the\r\nglade he searched until he found the other hunting-knife. Also, in\r\ngroping under the murder tree he found a small buckskin sack filled with\r\ncoins. A lighted match showed him the contents--a handful of bright\r\nEnglish sovereigns. The inference was plain; the two men had fought for\r\nthe possession of the gold, and both had lost.\r\n\r\nPrime went back to the river and, kneeling at the water's edge, scoured\r\nthe two knives with sand to remove the blood-stains. That done, and the\r\nknives well hidden in the bow of the canoe, he made another journey to\r\nthe glade and carefully scattered the ashes of the five fires.\r\n\r\nOwing to the civilized pre-existence, he was fagged and weary to the\r\npoint of collapse when he finally returned to the campfire on the lake\r\nbeach and flung himself down beside it to sleep. But for long hours\r\nsleep would not come, and when it did come it was little better than a\r\nsuccession of hideous nightmares in which two dark-faced men were\r\nreproachfully throttling him and dragging him down into the bottomless\r\ndepths of the outlet river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n                            A SECRET FOR ONE\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIME awoke unrefreshed at the moment when the morning sun was beginning\r\nto gild the tops of the highest trees, to find his campmate up and\r\nbusying herself housewifely over the breakfast fire.\r\n\r\n\"You looked so utterly tired and worn out I thought I'd let you sleep as\r\nlong as you could,\" she offered. \"Are you feeling any better this\r\nmorning?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sick,\" he protested, wincing a little in spite of himself in\r\ndeference to the stiffened thews and sinews.\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't be,\" she argued cheerfully. \"To-day is the day when we must\r\ngo back a few thousand years and become Stone-Age people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meaning that the provisions will be gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are rabbits,\" he asserted. \"I saw two of them yesterday. Does\r\nthe domestic-science course include the cooking of rabbits _au\r\nvoyageur_?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is going to include the cooking of anything we can find to cook.\r\nDoes the literary course include the catching of rabbits with one's bare\r\nhands?\"\r\n\r\n\"It includes an imagination which is better than the possession of many\r\ntraps and weapons,\" he jested. \"I feel it in my bones that we are not\r\ngoing to starve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us be thankful to your bones,\" she returned gayly, and at this\r\nPrime felt the grisly night and its horrors withdrawing a little way.\r\n\r\nThere was more of the cheerful badinage to enliven the scanty breakfast,\r\nbut there was pathos in the air when Prime felt for his cigarette-papers\r\nand mechanically opened his empty tobacco-pouch.\r\n\r\n\"You poor man!\" she cooed, pitying him. \"What will you do now?\"\r\n\r\nPrime had a thought which was only partly regretful. He might have\r\nsearched in the pockets of the dead men for more tobacco, but it had not\r\noccurred to him at the time. He dismissed the thought and came back to\r\nthe playing of his part in the secret for one.\r\n\r\n\"The lack of tobacco is a small consideration, when there is so much\r\nelse at stake,\" he maintained. \"If the Grider guess is the right one, it\r\nis evident that something has turned up to tangle it. Unscrupulous as he\r\nis in the matter of idiotic jokes, I know him well enough to be sure\r\nthat he wouldn't leave us here to famish. He is only an amateur aviator,\r\nand it is quite within the possibilities that he has wrecked himself\r\nsomewhere. It seems to me that we ought to take this river for a guide\r\nand push on for ourselves. Doesn't it appear that way to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"If we only had a boat of some kind,\" she sighed. \"But even then we\r\ncouldn't push very far without something to eat.\"\r\n\r\nIt was time to usher in the glad surprise, and Prime began to gather up\r\nthe breakfast leavings. \"We'll go over and have a look at the river,\r\nanyway,\" he suggested, and a few minutes later he had led the way across\r\nthe point of land, and had heard the young woman's cry of delight and\r\nrelief when she discovered the stranded canoe.\r\n\r\n\"You knew about this all the time,\" was her reproachful accusation. \"You\r\nwere over here last night. That is why you had the prophetic bones a\r\nlittle while ago. Why didn't you tell me before?\"\r\n\r\nHe grinned. \"At the moment you seemed cheerful enough without the\r\naddition of the good news. Do you know what is in that canoe?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Things to eat,\" he avouched solemnly; \"lots of them! More than we could\r\neat in a month.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they are not ours,\" she objected.\r\n\r\n\"No matter; we are going to eat them just the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that we can hire the owners to take us out of this wilderness?\r\nHave you any money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty of it,\" he boasted, chinking the buckskin bag in his pocket, the\r\nfinding of which he had, up to this moment, entirely forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"But where are the owners? I don't see any camp.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is one reason why I didn't tell you last night. I found the canoe,\r\nbut I didn't find anything that looked--er--like a camp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall have to sit down patiently and wait until they come back.\r\nThey wouldn't go very far away and leave a loaded canoe alone like this,\r\nwould they?\"\r\n\r\nPrime gave a furtive side glance at the shadowy pool in the eddy. Truly\r\nthe canoe-owners had not gone very far, but it was quite far enough. If\r\nhe could have framed any reasonable excuse for it, he would have urged\r\nthe immediate borrowing of the canoe, and an equally immediate departure\r\nfrom the spot of grisly associations. Indeed, he did go so far as to\r\nsuggest it, and was brought up standing, as he more than half expected\r\nto be, against Miss Millington's conscience.\r\n\r\n\"Why, certainly we couldn't do anything like that!\" she protested. \"It\r\nwould be highway robbery! We must wait until they return. Surely they\r\nwon't be gone very long.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it except in telling her the shocking truth, and\r\nPrime was not equal to that. So he reconciled himself as best he could\r\nto the enforced delay, hoping that the tender conscience would not\r\ndemand too much time.\r\n\r\nAlmost at once the owner of the conscience suggested that they make a\r\nround through the adjoining forest in an attempt to discover the camp of\r\nthe missing men. Prime acceded cheerfully enough, though he was\r\nimpatient to examine the canoe-load, in which he was hoping there might\r\nprove to be a supply of tobacco. For the better part of the forenoon\r\nthey quartered the forest around and about between the river and the\r\nlake in widening circles, missing nothing but the glade of horrors,\r\nwhich Prime took good care to avoid. At noon they came back to the\r\ncanoe-landing and made a frugal meal on the remains of their own store\r\nof food.\r\n\r\n\"We are too punctiliously foolish,\" Prime declared when the second meal\r\nwithout its tobacco aftermath had been endured. \"You say we are obliged\r\nto wait, and in that case we shall have to borrow, sooner or later. I\r\ndon't see any reason why we shouldn't begin it now. We can explain\r\neverything, you know; and, besides, I have money with which to pay for\r\nwhat we take.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your money isn't Canadian money,\" was the ready objection voiced by\r\nthe tender conscience.\r\n\r\nPrime's laugh did not ring quite true. \"That is where you are mistaken,\"\r\nhe retorted. \"It is good English gold, in sovereigns.\"\r\n\r\nIf the young woman were surprised to learn that a man who had expected\r\nto motor out of Canada in a day or two at the most had supplied himself\r\nwith a stock of English sovereigns, she did not question the fact. But\r\nfor fear she might, Prime went on hastily:\r\n\r\n\"I always like to be prepared for all kinds of emergencies when I leave\r\nhome, and this time I wasn't sure just where I was going to bring up,\r\nyou know--after Grider had changed his mind as to our starting-point.\"\r\n\r\nThe evasion served its purpose, and the young woman assented to an\r\nimmediate examination of the canoe-load. Prime helped her down the steep\r\nbank, and they began to rummage, spreading their findings out on the\r\nlittle beach. As Prime had intimated, there was a liberal stock of\r\nprovisions--jerked deer-meat, smoke-cured bacon, flour, meal, salt,\r\nbaking-powder, tea, and sugar, but no coffee, a few tins of vegetables,\r\na small sack of potatoes, and, last but not least, a canvas-covered mass\r\nof something which they decided was pemmican.\r\n\r\nRummaging further, the precious tobacco came to light--two huge twists\r\nof it hidden in the centre of one of the two remaining blanket-rolls.\r\nPrime stopped right where he was, crumbled a bit of the dried leaf in\r\nhis hands, and made a cigarette, his companion looking on with a little\r\nlip-curl which might have been of derision or merely of amusement.\r\n\r\n\"Is it good?\" she asked, when he had inhaled the first deep breath.\r\n\r\n\"It's vile!\" he returned. \"At the same time, it is so much better than\r\nnothing that I could do a Highland fling for pure joy. Take my advice,\r\nMiss Millington, and never become a slave to the tobacco habit.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Miss Millington,'\" she repeated, half musingly. \"Doesn't that strike\r\nyou as being a trifle absurd at this distance from a drawing-room?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Is it good?\" she asked, when he had inhaled the first\r\ndeep breath.]\r\n\r\n\"It surely does,\" he admitted frankly; \"and so, for that matter, does\r\n'Mr. Prime.'\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him with a charming little grimace.\r\n\r\n\"I'll concede the 'Lucetta' if you will concede the 'Donald.'\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a go,\" he laughed. \"It is the last of the conventions, and we'll\r\ntell it good-by without a whimper.\" With the goodly array of foodstuff\r\nspread out upon the sand, and with his back carefully turned upon the\r\npool of dread, he felt that he could afford to be light-hearted.\r\n\r\nThere was only a little more of the rummaging to be done. A\r\ncanvas-covered roll unlashed from its place beneath a canoe-stay proved\r\nto be a square of duck large enough to make a small sleeping-tent.\r\nInside of this roll there was an ample stock of cartridges for the two\r\nrepeating rifles lying cased in their canvas covers in the bottom of the\r\nboat, and an Indian-tanned deerskin used as a wrapping for the\r\nammunition. With the guns there was a serviceable woodsman's axe. In\r\nthe bow, where Prime had dropped the two savage-looking hunting-knives,\r\nthere were a few utensils: a teapot, a camper's skillet large enough to\r\nbe worth while, tin cup and plates, an empty whiskey-bottle, and a\r\nbasin--the latter presumably for the dough-mixing.\r\n\r\nAfter they had their findings lying on the sand the tender conscience\r\ncame in play again, and nothing would do but everything must be put back\r\njust as they had found it, Prime drawing the line, however, at a portion\r\nof the tobacco and enough of the food to serve for supper and breakfast.\r\nDuring the remainder of the afternoon they left the canoe-load\r\nundisturbed, but when evening came Prime borrowed the basin, the cups,\r\nplates, and the larger skillet. Farther along he borrowed the canvas\r\nroll and the axe and set up the tiny sleeping-tent, placing it so that\r\nLucetta, if she were so minded, could see the fire.\r\n\r\nJust before she retired the young woman made a generous protest.\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't do all the borrowing for me,\" she insisted. \"Go right down\r\nthere and get one of those blanket-rolls for yourself. I shan't sleep a\r\nwink if you don't.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning there were more speculations, on the young woman's\r\npart, as to the whereabouts of the canoe-owners, with much wonderment at\r\ntheir protracted absence and the singular abandonment of their entire\r\noutfit, even to the weapons. Whereat Prime invented all sorts of\r\ntheories to account for this curious state of affairs, all of them much\r\nmore ingenious than plausible.\r\n\r\nFor himself, the mystery was scarcely less unexplainable. Why two men,\r\nevidently outfitted for a long journey, should stop by the way, build\r\nfive fires that were plainly not camp-fires, and then fall to and fight\r\neach other to death over a bag of English sovereigns, were puzzles that\r\nhe did not attempt to solve in his own behalf. It was enough that the\r\nfacts had befallen, and that the net result for a pair of helpless\r\ncastaways was a well-stocked canoe which Lucetta's acid-proof honesty\r\nwas still preventing them from appropriating.\r\n\r\nAfter a breakfast served with the garnishings afforded by the\r\nHeaven-sent supplies, Prime uncased the two rifles and looked them\r\nover. They were United States products of an early edition, but were\r\napparently serviceable and in good order. In the canvas case of one of\r\nthe guns there was a packet of fish-lines and hooks. At Lucetta's\r\nsuggestion a few shots were fired as a signal for the lost canoe-owners.\r\nNothing coming of this, they tried a little target practice, selecting\r\nthe largest tree in sight for a mark, and both missing it with\r\nmonotonous regularity. Later in the day Prime brought the talk around by\r\ndegrees to the expediencies. How much of the present good weather must\r\nthey waste in waiting for the hypothetical return of the absentees?\r\nPerhaps some accident had happened; perhaps the absentees would never\r\nturn up. Who could tell?\r\n\r\nDomestic Science, with gymnasium-teaching on the side, fought the\r\nsuggestion to which all this pointed. They had no manner of right to\r\ntake the canoe and its belongings without the consent of the owners.\r\nWhat was the hurry? By waiting they would be sure to obtain the help\r\nthey were needing, and another day or two must certainly end the\r\nsuspense.\r\n\r\nPrime went as far as he could without telling the shocking truth. With\r\nthe dead men's pool so near at hand he was shudderingly anxious to be\r\ngone, but the young woman's logic was unanswerable and the delay was\r\nextended. A single small advance marked this second day. Along toward\r\nevening Prime unloaded the canoe, and together they made a few heroic\r\nattempts to acquire the art of paddling. It was apparently a lost art so\r\nfar as they were concerned. The big birch-bark, lightened of its load,\r\ndid everything but what it was expected to do, yawing and careening\r\nunder the unskilful handling in a most disconcerting manner.\r\n\r\n\"If I could only rig up some way to row the thing!\" Prime exclaimed,\r\nwhen they had contrived to drift and seesaw half a mile or more down the\r\nalmost currentless first reach of the stream.\r\n\r\n\"You couldn't,\" asserted the more practical young woman. \"The sides are\r\nas thin as paper, and they wouldn't hold rowlocks if you could make\r\nthem. Besides, who ever heard of rowing a birch-bark canoe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Somebody will hear of it, if I ever live to work this vacation trip of\r\nours into a story--No, no; paddle the other way! We want to turn around\r\nand go back!\"\r\n\r\nThey got the hang of it a little better after a while, the young woman\r\ncatching the knack first; and after much labor they won back to their\r\ncamping-place on the small peninsula. Over the evening fire Prime\r\nunwrapped the deerskin they had found in the canvas-roll.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to have moccasins of some sort,\" he announced. \"That\r\nflimsy boat isn't going to stand for shoes with heels on them. Does\r\ndomestic science include a semester in shoemaking? I can assure you in\r\nadvance that literature doesn't.\"\r\n\r\nLucetta took the leather and sat for a time regarding it thoughtfully.\r\n\"No needle, no thread, no pattern,\" she mused. \"And if we cut it and\r\nspoil it there won't be enough left for two pairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you have an idea, try it; I'll stand the expense of the leather,\"\r\nchuckled Prime, with large liberality.\r\n\r\nBut now the young woman was hesitating on another score.\r\n\r\n\"This leather belongs to the owners of the canoe; I don't know that we\r\nhave any right to cut it,\" she objected.\r\n\r\nPrime was tempted to say things objurgatory of these phantom owners who\r\nwould not down, but he didn't. Every fresh reference to the two dead men\r\ngave him an impulse to glance over his shoulder at the silent pool in\r\nthe eddy, and the longer the thing went on the less able he was to\r\ncontrol the prompting.\r\n\r\n\"You forget that we are able to pay for all damages,\" was what he really\r\ndid say, and at that the young woman removed a shoe, placed a neatly\r\nstockinged foot on the skin and marked around it with a bit of charcoal\r\ntaken from the fire, leaving a generous margin. Borrowing Prime's\r\npocket-knife she cut to the line, made tiny buttonholes all around the\r\npiece, and threaded them with a drawing-string made of the soft leather.\r\n\r\n\"You've got it!\" exclaimed the unskilled one in open-eyed admiration,\r\nafter the one-piece slipper was fashioned and tried on. \"You are a\r\nwonder! I shouldn't have thought of that in a month of Sundays. It's\r\ncapital!\"\r\n\r\nThere was enough material in the single skin to make the two pairs, with\r\nsomething left over, and Prime put his on at once with a sigh of relief\r\nborn of the grateful chance to get rid of the civilized shoes. Past that\r\nthere was more talk about the ever-thickening mysteries, and again\r\nLucetta refused to accept the Grider explanation, while Prime clung to\r\nit simply because he could not invent any other. Yet it was borne in\r\nupon him that the mystery was edging away from the Grider hypothesis in\r\nspite of all he could do. There was nothing to connect the two canoemen,\r\nfighting over the purse of gold, with Grider, or with the abduction of a\r\nschool-teacher and a writer of stories; yet there were pointings here,\r\ntoo, if one might read them. Why were the five fires lighted in the\r\nglade unless it were for a signal of some sort? Prime wished from the\r\nbottom of his heart that he could set the keen mentality of his\r\ncompanion at work on this latest phase of the mystery, but with the dead\r\nmen lying stiff and still at the bottom of their pool less than a\r\nstone's throw away, his courage failed him and his lips were sealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\n                              CANOEDLINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nON the fifth morning--their third at the peninsula camp--Prime\r\nregistered a solemn vow to make this the last day of the entirely\r\nunnecessary delay. More and more he was tormented by the fear that the\r\ndead men might escape from their weightings and rise to become a menace\r\nto Lucetta's sanity or his own; and, though he had been given the best\r\npossible proof that his companion was above reproach in the matter of\r\ncalm courage and freedom from hysteria, he meant to take no chances--for\r\nher or for himself.\r\n\r\nAt his suggestion they began the day by making another essay at the\r\npaddling, embarking in the emptied canoe shortly after breakfast.\r\nGaining a little facility after an hour or so, they headed the\r\nbirch-bark downstream past the point which they had reached the previous\r\nafternoon, and soon found themselves in a quickening current. Prime,\r\nkneeling in the bow, gave the word, and Lucetta obeyed it.\r\n\r\n\"We'll try the quick water,\" he flung back to her. \"We'll have to have\r\nthe experience, and we had better get it with the empty canoe, rather\r\nthan with the load.\"\r\n\r\nThis seemed logical, but it led to results. In a short time the shores\r\ngrew rocky and there was no safe place to land. Moreover, the little\r\nriver was now running so swiftly that they were afraid to try to turn\r\naround. Rapid after rapid was passed in vain struggles to stop the\r\ntriumphal progress, and if the canoe's lading had been aboard, Prime\r\nwould have been entirely happy, since every rapid they shot was taking\r\nthem farther away from the scene of the tragedy. But the lading was not\r\naboard.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to do something to head off this runaway!\" the bowman shouted\r\nback over his shoulder in one of the quieter raceways. \"We're leaving\r\nour commissary behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything you say,\" chimed in the steers-woman from the stern of the\r\ndancing runaway. \"My knees are getting awfully tired, but I can stand it\r\nas long as you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the trouble,\" Prime called back.\r\n\r\n\"We're staying with it too long. The next pool we come to, you paddle\r\nlike mad, all on one side, and I'll do the same. We've simply _got_ to\r\nturn around!\"\r\n\r\nThe manoeuvre worked like a charm. A succession of the eddy-pools came\r\nrushing up from down-stream, and in the third of them they contrived to\r\nget the birch-bark reversed and pointed up-stream. Then it suddenly\r\noccurred to the young woman that they had had their trouble for nothing;\r\nthat the same end might have been gained if they had merely turned\r\nthemselves around and faced the other way. Her shriek of laughter made\r\nPrime stop paddling for the moment.\r\n\r\n\"I need a guardian--we both need guardians!\" he snorted, when she told\r\nhim what she was laughing at, and then they dug their paddles in a\r\nfrantic effort to stem the swift current.\r\n\r\nIt was no go--less than no go. In spite of all they could do the\r\nbirch-bark refused to be driven up-stream. What was worse, it began to\r\ndrift backward, slowly at first, but presently at a pace which made them\r\nquickly turn to face the other way lest they be smashed in a rapid. A\r\nmile or more fled to the rear before they could take breath, and two\r\nmore rapids were passed, up which Prime knew they could never force the\r\ncanoe with any skill they possessed or were likely to acquire.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the next lull in the unmanageable flight, he shouted\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to go ashore! We are getting so far away now that we shall\r\nnever get back. You're steering: try it in the next quiet place we come\r\nto, and I'll do all I can to help.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"next quiet place\" proved to be a full half-mile farther along, and\r\nthey had a dozen hairbreadth escapes in more of the quick stretches\r\nbefore they reached it. Prime lived years in moments in the swifter\r\nrushes. Knowing his own helplessness in the water, he was in deadly fear\r\nof a capsize, not from any unmanly dread of death but because he had a\r\nvivid and unnerving picture of Lucetta's predicament if she should\r\nescape and be left alone and helpless in the heart of the forest\r\nwilderness. He drew his first good breath after the runaway canoe had\r\nbeen safely beached on the shore of an eddy and they had tottered\r\ncarefully out of it to drag it still higher upon the shelving bank.\r\n\r\n\"My heavens!\" he panted, throwing himself down to gasp at leisure. \"I\r\nwouldn't go through that again for a farm in Paradise! Weren't you\r\nscared stiff?\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly was,\" was the frank admission. The young woman had taken\r\nher characteristic attitude, sitting down with her chin propped in her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"But, just the same, you didn't forget to paddle!\" Prime exulted. \"You\r\nare a comrade, right, Lucetta! It's a thousand pities you aren't a man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it?\" she murmured, without turning her head.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know--I was simply paralyzed at the thought of what would happen\r\nif we should upset--not so much at the thought of what would be certain\r\nto happen to me, but on your account.\"\r\n\r\n\"The protective instinct,\" she remarked; \"it is like a good many other\r\nthings which we have outgrown--or are outgrowing--quite useless, but\r\nstubbornly persistent.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that you don't need it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't needed it yet, have I?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he admitted soberly. \"So far, you have had the nerve, and more\r\nthan your share of the physique.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had better training, perhaps,\" she offered, as if willing to\r\nmake it easier for him. \"A little farther along you will begin to\r\ndevelop, while I shall stand still.\"\r\n\r\nBut Prime would not let it rest at that.\r\n\r\n\"I have always maintained that most women have a finer nerve, and finer\r\ncourage, than most men; I am speaking now of the civilized average. You\r\nare proving my theory, and I owe you something. But to get back to\r\nthings present; doesn't it occur to you that we have gotten ourselves\r\ninto a rather awkward mess?\"\r\n\r\n\"It does, indeed. We must be miles from anything to eat, and if you know\r\nof any way to take this canoe up-stream I wish you would tell me; I\r\ndon't.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be by main strength and awkwardness, as the Irishman played the\r\ncornet, if we do it at all,\" Prime decided.\r\n\r\n\"And if, in the meantime, the owners come back and find it gone----\"\r\n\r\nPrime got up stiffly. \"I have a feeling that they haven't come back yet,\r\nand it is growing fast into a feeling that they are not going to come\r\nback at all. Shall we try a towing stunt?\"\r\n\r\nThey tried it, though they had no towline and were reduced to the\r\nnecessity of dragging the canoe along in the shallows, each with a hand\r\non the gunwale. This did not answer very well, and after fighting for a\r\nhalf-hour in the first of the rapids and getting thoroughly wet and\r\nbedraggled they had to give it up and reverse the process, letting the\r\nbirch-bark drift down to the safe dockage again.\r\n\r\nWhile they were resting from their labors, and the hampered half of the\r\ntowing squad was wringing the water from her skirts, Prime looked at his\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n\"Heavens and earth!\" he exclaimed. \"It is noon already! I thought I was\r\nbeginning to feel that way inside. Why didn't we have sense enough to\r\ntake a bite along with us when we left camp this morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if you are going into the whys, why didn't we have sense enough to\r\nknow that we couldn't handle the canoe? How far have we come?\"\r\n\r\nPrime shook his head. \"You couldn't prove it by me. A part of the time\r\nit seemed to me that we were bettering a mile a minute.\" He got up and\r\nhobbled back and forth on the little beach to work the canoe-cramp out\r\nof his knees. \"It looks to me as if we are up against it good and hard;\r\nthe canoe is here, and the dunnage is up yonder. Which do we do: carry\r\nthe canoe to the dunnage, or the dunnage to the canoe? It's a heavenly\r\nchoice either way around. What do you say?\"\r\n\r\nLucetta voted at once for the canoe-carrying, if it were at all\r\npossible. So much, she said, they owed to the owners, who had every\r\nright to expect to find their property where they had left it. Again\r\nPrime was tempted to say hard things about the ghosts which so\r\nstubbornly refused to be laid, and again he denied himself.\r\n\r\n\"The canoe it is,\" he responded grimly, but by the time they had dragged\r\nthe light but unwieldy craft out of the water and part way up the bank\r\nthey were convinced that the other alternative was the only one. A\r\nshort portage they might have made, or possibly a long one, if they had\r\nknown enough to turn the birch-bark bottom-side up and carry it on their\r\nheads _voyageur_-fashion. But they still had this to learn.\r\n\r\n\"It's a frost,\" was Prime's decision after they had tugged and stumbled\r\na little way with the clumsy burden knocking at their legs. \"The\r\nmountain won't go to Mohammed--that much is perfectly plain. Are you\r\ngame for a long portage with the camp outfit? It seems to be the only\r\nthing there is left for us to do.\"\r\n\r\nThe young woman was game, and since they were on the wrong side of the\r\nriver they put the canoe into the water again and paddled to the other\r\nside, leaving the birch-bark drawn out upon the bank of the eddy-pool.\r\nFrom that they went on, hunger urging them and the water-softened\r\nmoccasins holding them back and making them pick their way like children\r\nin the first few days of the barefoot season. The distance proved to be\r\nabout three miles and they made it in something over an hour. The embers\r\nof their morning fire were still alive, and the belated midday meal was\r\nquickly cooked and despatched.\r\n\r\n\"Now for the hard part of it,\" Prime announced, as he began to pack the\r\ncamp outfit. \"You sit right still and rest, and I'll get things ready\r\nfor the tote.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have determined to ride roughshod over the rights of the\r\npeople who own the things?\" the young woman asked.\r\n\r\nPrime turned his back deliberately upon the pool of dread.\r\n\r\n\"Necessity knows no law, and we can't stay here forever waiting for\r\nsomething to turn up. Somebody has given us a strong-hand deal, for what\r\nreason God only knows, and we've got to fight out of it the best way we\r\ncan. We'll take these things, and we are willing to pay for them if\r\nanybody should ask us to; but in any event we are going to take them,\r\nbecause it is a matter of life and death to us. I'll shoulder all the\r\nresponsibility, moral and otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed a little at this. \"More of the protective instinct? I can't\r\nallow that--my conscience is my own. But I suppose you are right. There\r\ndoesn't seem to be anything else to do. And you needn't fit all of\r\nthose packs to your own back; I propose to carry my share.\"\r\n\r\nHe protested at that, and learned one more thing about Lucetta\r\nMillington: up to a certain point she was as docile and leadable as the\r\nwoman of the Stone Age is supposed to have been, and beyond that she was\r\nadamant.\r\n\r\n\"You said a little while ago it was a pity I wasn't a man: it is the\r\nwoman's part nowadays to ask no odds. Will you try to remember that?\"\r\n\r\nHere was a hint of a brand-new Lucetta, and Prime wondered how he had\r\ncontrived to live twenty-eight years in a world of women only to be\r\nbrought in contact for the first time with the real, simon-pure article\r\nin the heart of a Canadian wilderness. Nevertheless he took her at her\r\nword and made a small pack for her, with a carrying-strap cut from the\r\nremains of the deerskin. At the very best the portage promised to demand\r\nthree trips, which was appalling.\r\n\r\nIt was well past the middle of the afternoon when they reached the canoe\r\nat the end of the first carry. The three-mile trudge had been made in\r\nsilence, neither of the amateur carriers having breath to spare for\r\ntalk. Since they had the tent and one of the blanket-rolls and\r\nsufficient food, Prime was for putting off the remaining double carry to\r\nanother day, but again Lucetta was adamant.\r\n\r\n\"If we do that we shall lose all day tomorrow,\" was the form her protest\r\ntook; \"and now that we have started we had better keep on going.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what is the frantic hurry?\" Prime cut in. \"You said your school\r\ndidn't begin until September. Haven't we the entire, unspoiled summer\r\nahead of us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Clothes,\" she remarked briefly. \"Yours may last all summer, but mine\r\nwon't--not if we have to go on tramping through the woods every day.\"\r\n\r\nPrime's laugh was a shout. \"We'll be blanket Indians, both of us, before\r\nwe get out of this. I feel that in my bones, too. But about the second\r\ncarry; we'll make it if you say so. It will at least give us a good\r\nappetite for supper.\"\r\n\r\nThey made it, reaching the end of the six-mile doubling a short while\r\nbefore the late sunset. Prime was all in, down, and out, but he would\r\nnot admit it until after the supper had been eaten and the shelter-tent\r\nset up over its bed of spruce-tips. Then he let go with both hands.\r\n\r\n\"I'm dog-tired, and I am not ashamed to admit it,\" he confessed. \"But\r\nyou--you look as fresh as a daisy. What are you made of--spring steel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not by any manner of means; but I wasn't going to be the first to say\r\nanything. I feel as if I were slowly ossifying. I wouldn't walk another\r\nmile to-night for a fortune.\"\r\n\r\nPrime stretched himself lazily before the fire with his hands under his\r\nhead. \"Luckily, you don't have to. You had better turn in and get all\r\nthe sleep that is coming to you. I'm going to hit the blankets after I\r\nsmoke another pinch of this horrible tobacco.\"\r\n\r\nAs he sat up to roll the pinch a rising wind began to swish through the\r\ntree-tops. A little later there was a fitful play of lightning followed\r\nby a muttering of distant thunder.\r\n\r\n\"That means rain, and you are going to get wet,\" said the young woman,\r\nas she was preparing to creep under her canvas. An instant later a gusty\r\nblast came down the river, threatening to scatter the fire. Prime sprang\r\nup at once and began to take the necessary precautions against a\r\nconflagration. In the midst of the haste-making he heard his companion\r\nsay: \"We might drag the canoe up here and turn it over so that you could\r\nhave it for a shelter.\"\r\n\r\nWith the fire safely banked they went together to the river's edge to\r\ncarry out her suggestion. By this time the precursor blast of the shower\r\nwas lashing the little river into foam, and the spray from the rapid\r\njust above them wet their faces. One glance, lightning assisted, at the\r\nlittle beach where they had drawn up the canoe was enough. The\r\nbirch-bark was gone.\r\n\r\nThe young woman was the first to find speech. At another lightning-flash\r\nshe cried out quickly:\r\n\r\n\"There it is! Don't you see it?--going down the river! The wind is\r\nblowing it away!\"\r\n\r\nImmediately they dashed off in pursuit, stumbling through the forest in\r\ndarkness, which, between the lightning-flashes, was like a blanketing of\r\ninvisibility. The race was a short one. One flash showed them the canoe\r\ndancing down the raceway of a lower rapid, and at the next it had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n\r\n                          _ROULANT MA BOULE_\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the disappearance of the canoe Prime called the halt which the black\r\ndarkness was insisting upon, and they made their way back in the teeth\r\nof the storm to the camp-fire. In a few minutes the summer squall had\r\nblown itself out, with scarcely enough rain to make a drip from the\r\ntrees. Weary as he was, Prime took the axe, searched until he found a\r\npine stump, and from it hewed the material for a couple of torches. With\r\nthese for light they set out doggedly down-stream in search of their\r\nlost hope.\r\n\r\nHappily, since they were both fagged enough to drop in their tracks, the\r\nbirch-bark was discovered stranded on their side of the river a hundred\r\nyards below the lower rapid. This time they ran no risks, and, though it\r\ncost them a half-hour of stumbling toil, they did not rest until they\r\nhad carried the canoe around the rapid to place it high and dry in the\r\nlittle glade where they had made their camp.\r\n\r\nThe next morning found them plentifully stiff and sore from their\r\nstrenuous exertions of the day before, but there was good cheer in the\r\nthought that thus far they had triumphed stoutly over difficulty and\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\n\"I feel as if I couldn't put one foot before the other, and I am sure\r\nyou must be in the same condition,\" Prime groaned, over the second\r\nhelping of fried potatoes and bacon, served in Domestic Science's best\r\nstyle. \"Just the same, I mean to take a dose of the hair of the dog that\r\nbit me and go up after the remainder of our loot. While I am doing it\r\nyou must stay here and watch the canoe, to see that it doesn't run away\r\nagain. I wouldn't trust it a single minute, even on dry land.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" was the firm rejoinder. \"You must get the sex idea out of your\r\nhead once for all, Donald. It will be time enough for you to make it\r\neasy for me when I need it worse than I do now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday I said you were a wonder, Lucetta; to-day I rise to remark\r\nthat you are two wonders, and mighty plucky ones at that.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to-morrow I shall be three wonders, and the next day four, and so\r\non to infinity, I suppose,\" she said, laughing. \"By the way, speaking of\r\ndays, what day is this?\"\r\n\r\nPrime drew a notched twig from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Don't ever say after this that I am not the original Robinson Crusoe,\"\r\nhe grinned. \"I cut this twig the second day, just before we began the\r\nhike for the river.\" Then he counted up: \"According to my almanac, this\r\nought to be Monday--wash-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then yesterday was Sunday, which is why we had all our bad luck. We\r\nought to have gone to church. Is it possible that we were both in Quebec\r\nno longer ago than last Tuesday night? It seems as if months had elapsed\r\nsince then--months, I said, but I ought to have said ages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are things changing for you so radically, then?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"They are, indeed. And for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I guess so. For one thing, I have discovered the habitat of about\r\na million muscles that I didn't know I had; and for another----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" she challenged, \"why don't you say it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will say it. For another, I have discovered the most remarkable woman\r\nthat ever lived.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed joyously. \"See what a few days of unavoidable propinquity\r\nwill do! But you are mistaken--I'm not especially remarkable. You are\r\nonly doing what Mr. Grider said you ought to do--studying the female of\r\nthe species at short range.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grider was an ass!\" was the impatient rejoinder. \"If I had him here I'd\r\nduck him in the river in spite of his fifty pounds excess. But this\r\nisn't getting the remainder of the dunnage. Are you quite sure you want\r\nto go along?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite sure,\" she returned, and once more they took the riverside trail\r\nto the stream-head.\r\n\r\nThe third carry was lighter than the others had been, and the six-mile\r\ntramp was the best possible antidote for stiffened joints and lamed\r\nmuscles. By the time they had reassembled themselves and their\r\nbelongings in the little glade between the rapids they were both in fine\r\nfettle, and ready to begin the real journey.\r\n\r\nThe loading of the canoe was a new thing, but in this they gave common\r\nsense a free rein. The camp stuff and provisions were made into packages\r\nwith the blankets and the tent canvas for wrappings; and each package\r\nwas securely lashed beneath the brace-bars of the birch-bark, so that in\r\ncase of a capsize there would still be some chance for salvage. Prime's\r\nfinal precaution was worthy of a real woodsman. Drying the empty\r\nwhiskey-bottle carefully with a wisp of grass, he filled it with\r\nmatches, corked it tightly, and skewered it in an inside pocket of his\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\n\"You are learning,\" Lucetta observed; and then: \"Did you get that out of\r\na story?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed; I dug it up whole out of my literary imagination. If I\r\nshould tumble overboard you want to be sure to save the pieces, if you\r\never hope to see a fire again. Are we all ready?\"\r\n\r\nFive minutes later they had taken their lives in their hands and were\r\nshooting the rapids. With the laden canoe the paddling was an entirely\r\ndifferent proposition. Mile after mile the quick water held, with only\r\nthe shortest of reaches between Scylla and Charybdis for the\r\nbreath-catching. At first the keen strain of it keyed nerve and muscle\r\nto the snapping-point; but after a time the fine wine of peril had its\r\ndue and exhilarating effect, and they shouted and laughed, calling to\r\neach other above the turmoil of the waters, gasping joyously when the\r\nspray from the white-fanged boulders slapped them in the face, and\r\nhaving the luck of the innocent or the drunken, since disaster held\r\naloof and they escaped with nothing more serious than the spray\r\nwettings.\r\n\r\nThough light-heartedness thus sat in the saddle--or knelt on the\r\npaddling-mat--prudence was not wholly banished. At noon, when they\r\npulled out at the foot of a quiet reach to make a pot of tea, they found\r\nthat they were at the head of a rapid too swift and tortuous to offer\r\nanything but certain catastrophe. While the tea water was heating Prime\r\nwent ahead to reconnoitre.\r\n\r\n\"Too many chances,\" he reported on his return. \"And, besides, the carry\r\nis only a few hundred yards. It means more hard work, but we can't\r\nafford to run the risk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear me!\" sighed the young woman in mock despair; \"have we got to\r\nunload that canoe piece by piece, and then carry and load it all over\r\nagain?\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall doubtless have to do it so many times that we shall count that\r\nday lost when we are denied the opportunity,\" Prime laughed. \"But,\r\nHeaven helping us, we shall make no more three-mile portages, as we did\r\nyesterday.\"\r\n\r\nThe task did not seem quite so formidable after they had broken their\r\nfast. Moreover, in the repeated packings and unpackings, they were\r\ngaining facility. With the dunnage transported they were ready to attack\r\nthe birch-bark, and Lucetta had an inspiration.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't I seen a picture somewhere of the old _voyageurs_ carrying\r\ntheir canoes on their heads?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course!\" said Prime. \"Why didn't we think of that last night? I\r\nbelieve I could carry it that way alone. Now, then, over she goes and\r\nup she goes; you set the pace, and for pity's sake don't stumble.\"\r\n\r\nNobody stumbled, and in due time the canoe was launched below the\r\nrapids, was reloaded, and the paddling was resumed. This day, which\r\nended in a snug camp at the foot of a stretch of slow water which had\r\nkept them paddling all the afternoon, was a fair sample of their days\r\nthrough the remainder of the week. Night after night, after they had\r\nbeen shooting rapids, or making long carries, or paddling steadily\r\nthrough stretches where the current did not go fast enough for them,\r\nPrime found Lucetta's prophecy as to his growth coming true. Day by day\r\nhe was finding himself anew, advancing by leaps and bounds, as it\r\nseemed, into a stronger and fresher and simpler manhood.\r\n\r\nAnd as for the young woman--there were times when the realization that\r\nin a few hours of a single mysterious night she had passed from the\r\nworld of the commonplace into a world hitherto unpictured even in her\r\nwildest imaginings, was graspable, but these moments were rare.\r\nAdaptable, even under the fetterings of the conventions, Lucetta\r\nMillington was finding herself fairly gifted now that the fetterings\r\nwere removed. From childhood she had longed for an opportunity to\r\nexplore the undiscovered regions of her own individuality, and now the\r\nopportunity had come. It pleased her prodigiously to find that Prime\r\nseemed not to be even remotely touched by their unchaperoned condition.\r\nFrom the first he had been merely the loyal comrade, and she tried\r\nconsistently to meet him always upon his own ground--tried and\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday night they found themselves at the head of a long\r\nportage, still in the heart of the wilderness, and having yet to see the\r\nfirst sign of any human predecessor along the pathway traced through the\r\ngreat forest by their little river.\r\n\r\n\"I can't understand it,\" Prime said that night over the camp-fire. \"We\r\nhave covered a good many miles since last Monday, and still we don't\r\nseem to be getting anywhere. Another thing I don't fancy is the way the\r\nriver has changed its course. Have you noticed that for the last three\r\ndays it has been flowing mainly northward?\"\r\n\r\nThe young woman became interested at once. \"I hadn't noticed it,\" she\r\nadmitted, and then: \"Why don't you like it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it seems a bit ominous. It may mean that we were carted clear\r\nover to the northern side of the big watershed, though that doesn't seem\r\npossible. If we were, we are going painstakingly away from civilization\r\ninstead of toward it. That would account at once for the fact that we\r\nhaven't come across any timber-cuttings. The northern rivers all flow\r\ninto Hudson Bay.\"\r\n\r\nLucetta's gaze became abstracted. \"Besides that, we are still groping in\r\nthe blind alleys of the mysteries,\" she put in. \"Have you given up the\r\nMr. Grider idea?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't give it up wholly and save my sanity,\" Prime averred. \"Think a\r\nminute; if we throw that away, what have we to fall back upon? Nothing,\r\nabsolutely nothing! Nature abhors a vacuum, and so does the sane mind.\r\nDon't mistake me; I haven't the slightest idea that Grider let us in for\r\nany such experience as this, meaning to. But he took a chance, as every\r\npractical joker does, and the result in our case has spelled disaster.\r\nI am only hoping that it has spelled disaster for him, too, confound\r\nhim!\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled sweetly.\r\n\r\n\"Are you calling it disaster now? Only yesterday you said you were\r\nenjoying it. Have you changed your mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have, and I haven't. From a purely selfish point of view, I'm having\r\nthe finest kind of a vacation, and enjoying every blessed minute of it.\r\nMore than that, the raggeder I grow the better I feel. It's perfectly\r\nbarbarous, I know; but it is the truth. My compunctions are all\r\nvicarious. I shouldn't have had half so much fun if I had gone motoring\r\nthrough New England.\"\r\n\r\nThe young woman smiled again. \"You needn't waste any of the vicarious\r\ncompunctions on me. Honestly, Donald, I--I'm having the time of my life.\r\nIt is the call of the wild, I suppose. I shall go back home, if I ever\r\nreach home, a perfect savage, no doubt, but the life of the humdrum will\r\nnever be able to lay hold of me again, in the sense that it will possess\r\nme, as it used to.\"\r\n\r\nPrime's grin was an expression of the purely primitive.\r\n\r\n\"It is a reversion to type,\" he asserted, getting up to arrange\r\nLucetta's sleeping-tent. \"It makes one wonder if all humanity isn't\r\nbuilt that way; if it wouldn't go back at a gallop if it were given half\r\na chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't call it going back,\" was the quiet reply. \"I feel as if I had\r\nmerely dropped a large number of utterly useless hamperings. Life has\r\nnever seemed so free and completely desirable before, and yet, when we\r\nhave been running some of the most terrifying rapids, I have felt that I\r\ncould give it up without a murmur if I shouldn't prove big enough to\r\nkeep it in spite of the hazards. At such times I have felt that I could\r\ngo out with only one big regret--the thought that I wasn't going to live\r\nlong enough to find out _why_ I had to be drowned in the heart of a\r\nCanadian forest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VIII\r\n\r\n                            CRACKING VENEERS\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the foot of the long portage which had closed the week for them the\r\ntwo voyagers found the course of their river changing again to the\r\nsoutheastward, and were encouraged accordingly. In addition to the\r\nchanging course the stream was taking on greater volume, and, while the\r\nrapids were not so numerous, they were more dangerous, or at least they\r\nlooked so.\r\n\r\nBy this time they were acquiring considerable skill with the paddles,\r\ntogether with a fine, woodcrafty indifference to the hardships. In the\r\nquick water they were never dry, and they came presently to disregard\r\nthe wettings, or rather to take them as a part of the day's work. As the\r\ncomradeship ripened, their attitude toward each other grew more and more\r\nintolerant of the civilized reservations.\r\n\r\nOver the night fires their talk dug deeply into the abstractions, losing\r\nartificiality in just proportion to the cracking and peeling of the\r\nveneers.\r\n\r\n\"I am beginning to feel as though I had never touched the real realities\r\nbefore,\" was the way Prime expressed it at the close of a day in which\r\nthey had run a fresh gamut of all the perils. \"Life, the life that the\r\nvast majority of people thrive upon, will always seem ridiculously\r\ntrivial and commonplace to me after this. I never understood before that\r\ncivilization is chiefly an overlaying of extraneous things, and that,\r\ngiven a chance, it would disintegrate and fall away from us even as our\r\ncivilized clothes are doing right now.\"\r\n\r\nThe young woman looked up with a quaint little grimace. She was trying\r\nto patch the frayed hem of her skirt, sewing with a thread drawn from\r\none of the blankets and a clumsy needle Prime had fashioned for her out\r\nof a fish-bone.\r\n\r\n\"Please don't mention clothes,\" she begged. \"If we had more of the\r\ndeerskin I'd become a squaw at once. The fringes wouldn't look so bad if\r\nthey were done in leather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mere accessories,\" Prime declared, meaning the clothes. \"Civilization\r\nprescribes them, their cut, fashion, and material. The buckskin Indians\r\nhave the best of us in this, as in many other things.\"\r\n\r\n\"The realities?\" she queried.\r\n\r\n\"The simplicities,\" he qualified. \"Life as we have lived it, and as we\r\nshall probably live it again if we ever get out of this, is much too\r\ncomplex. We are learning how few the real necessities are, and it is\r\ngood for the soul. I wouldn't take a fortune for what I've been learning\r\nin these weeks, Lucetta.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been learning, too,\" she admitted.\r\n\r\n\"Other things besides the use of a paddle and a camp-fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Many other things. I have forgotten the world I knew best, and it is\r\ngoing to require a tremendous effort to remember it again when the need\r\narises.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall never get back to where I was before,\" Prime asserted with\r\ncheerful dogmatism. Then, in a fresh burst of confidence: \"Lucetta, I'm\r\ncoming to suspect that I have always been the merest surface-skimmer. I\r\nthought I knew life a little, and was even brash enough to attempt to\r\nwrite about it. I thought I could visualize humanity and its\r\npossibilities, but what I saw was only the outer skin--of people and of\r\nthings. But my greatest impertinence has been in my handling of women.\"\r\n\r\n\"Injustice?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Not intentional; just crass ignorance. I know now that I was merely\r\nimitative, choosing for models the character-drawings of men who knew\r\neven less about women than I did. Vapid sentimentality was about as far\r\nas I could get. It revolts me to think of it now.\"\r\n\r\nHer laugh was as unrestrained as that of a child. \"You amuse me, Donald.\r\nMost women are hopelessly sentimental. Don't you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not,\" he retorted soberly.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavens and earth! if I haven't had an opportunity to find out----\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't,\" she returned quietly; \"not the least little morsel of an\r\nopportunity. A few days ago we were thrown together--a man and a woman\r\nwho were total strangers, to live or die as the chance might fall. I\r\ndefy any one to be sentimental in such circumstances. Sentiment thrives\r\nonly in the artificialities; they are the very breath of its life. If\r\nmen and women could know each other as they really are, there would be\r\nfewer marriages, by far.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the few would be far happier,\" Prime put in.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so? I doubt it very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, in the most admirable marriage there must be some preservation\r\nof the reticences. It is possible for people to know each other too\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so, if the qualities are of the kind that will stand the\r\ntest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who has such qualities?\" she asked quickly.\r\n\r\n\"You have, for one. I didn't believe there was a human woman on earth\r\nwho could go through what you have and still keep sweet. Setting aside\r\nthe hardships, I fancy most other women would have gone stark, staring\r\nmad puzzling over the mystery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes; the mystery. Shall we ever be able to explain it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if we decide to throw Grider overboard, I'm afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't the Mr. Grider solution seem less and less possible to you as\r\ntime goes on?\" she asked. \"It does to me. The motive--a mere practical\r\njoke--isn't strong enough. Whoever abducted us was trying for something\r\nlarger than a laugh at our expense.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd think so, wouldn't you? Big risks were incurred, and the expense\r\nmust have been considerable, too. Still, as I have said before, if we\r\nleave Grider out of it we abandon the one only remotely tenable\r\nexplanation. I grant you that the joke motive is weak, but aside from\r\nthat there is no motive at all. Nobody in this world could have any\r\npossible object in getting rid of me, and I am sure that the assumption\r\napplies with equal force to you. You see where it leaves us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" was the ready rejoinder. \"If the mystery had stopped with our\r\ndiscovery of the aeroplane-tracks, it would have been different. But it\r\ndidn't stop there. It continued with our finding of the ownerless canoe\r\nstocked for a long journey. Was the canoe left for us to find?\"\r\n\r\nPrime knew his companion well enough by this time to be willing to trust\r\nher with the grewsome truth.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what connection the canoe may have had with our\r\nkidnapping, if any, but I am going to tell you something that I didn't\r\ncare to tell you until we were far enough away from the scene of it. We\r\nreasoned that there were two owners for the canoe, arguing from the two\r\nrifles and the two hunting-knives. Do you know why they didn't turn up\r\nwhile we were waiting for them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was because they couldn't. They were dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"You knew it at the time?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I found them. It was in a little glade just below our camp at the\r\nriver-head. They had fought a duel with knives. It was horrible, and I\r\nthought it best not to tell you--it seemed only the decent thing not to\r\ntell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you find them?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was when I went over to the river on the excuse of trying to get\r\nsome berries while you were cooking supper. I had seen the canoe when I\r\nwent after the can of water. Instead of looking for berries I began to\r\nhunt around for the owners, thinking that probably they were camped\r\nsomewhere near by. I didn't find any traces of a camp; but in the glade\r\nthere were the ashes of five fires arranged in the shape of a Greek\r\ncross: one fire in the middle and one at the end of each arm. This\r\nmystified me still more, but it was then growing so dark that it was no\r\nuse to look farther. Just as I was leaving the glade I stumbled over the\r\ntwo men, locked in each other's arms; they had evidently been dead for\r\nsome hours, or maybe days.\"\r\n\r\n\"How perfectly frightful!\" she exclaimed. \"I don't wonder that you\r\nlooked ill when you came back.\"\r\n\r\n\"It nearly knocked me out,\" Prime confessed. \"But I realized at once\r\nthat it wasn't necessary to multiply the shock by two. After you were\r\nasleep that night I went over and buried the two men--weighted them\r\nwith stones and sunk them in the river, since I didn't have anything to\r\ndig with. Afterward, while I was searching for the other knife, I found\r\na little buckskin bag filled with English sovereigns, lying, as I\r\nsupposed, where one of them had dropped it. It seemed to indicate the\r\nmotive for the desperate fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it adds just that much more to the mystery,\" was the young woman's\r\ncomment. \"Were they white men?\"\r\n\r\n\"Half-breeds or Indians, I couldn't tell which.\"\r\n\r\n\"Somebody hired them to do something with us?\" she suggested\r\ntentatively.\r\n\r\n\"That is only a guess. I have made it half a dozen times only to have it\r\npushed aside by the incredibilities. If we are to connect these two men\r\nwith our kidnapping, it presupposes an arrangement made far in advance.\r\nThat in itself is incredible.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of the five fires?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could make nothing of them unless they were intended for signal-fires\r\nof some kind; but even in that case the arrangement in the form of a\r\ncross wouldn't mean anything.\"\r\n\r\nThe young woman had finished her mending and was putting the fish-bone\r\nneedle carefully away against a time of future need.\r\n\r\n\"The arrangement might mean something if one were looking down upon it\r\nfrom above,\" she put in quietly.\r\n\r\nPrime got up to kick the burned log-ends into the heart of the fire.\r\n\r\n\"If I didn't have such a well-trained imagination, I might have thought\r\nof that,\" he said, with a short laugh. \"It was a signal, and it was\r\nlighted for the benefit of our aeroplane. How much farther does that get\r\nus?\"\r\n\r\nThe young woman was letting down the flaps of her sleeping-tent, and her\r\nanswer was entirely irrelevant.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad the protective instinct was sufficiently alive to keep you\r\nfrom telling me at the time,\" she said, with a little shudder which she\r\ndid not try to conceal. \"You may not believe it, Donald Prime, but I\r\nstill have a few of the civilized weaknesses. Good night; and don't sit\r\nup too long with that horrid tobacco.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IX\r\n\r\n                               SHIPWRECK\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGH the castaways had not especially intended to observe the day of\r\nrest, they did so, the Sunday dawning wet and stormy, with lowering\r\nclouds and foggy intervals between the showers to make navigation\r\nextrahazardous. When the rain settled into a steady downpour they pulled\r\nthe canoe out of water, turning it bottom-side up to serve as a roof to\r\nshelter them. In the afternoon Prime took one of the guns and went\r\nafield, in the hope of finding fresh meat of some sort, though it was\r\nout of season and he was more than dubious as to his skill as either a\r\nhunter or a marksman. But the smoked meats were becoming terribly\r\nmonotonous, and they had not yet had the courage to try the pemmican.\r\nQuite naturally, nothing came of the hunting expedition save a thorough\r\nand prolonged soaking of the hunter.\r\n\r\n\"The wild things have more sense than I have,\" he announced on his\r\nreturn. \"They know enough to stay in out of the rain. Can you stand the\r\ncold-storage stuff a little while longer?\"\r\n\r\nLucetta said she could, and specialized the Sunday-evening meal by\r\nconcocting an appetizing pan-stew of smoked venison and potatoes to vary\r\nthe deadly monotonies.\r\n\r\nThe Monday morning brought a return of the fine weather. The storm had\r\nblown itself out during the night and the skies were clearing. The day\r\nof rain had swollen the river quite perceptibly, and a short distance\r\nbelow their Sunday camp its volume was further augmented by the inflow\r\nof another river from the east, which fairly doubled its size.\r\n\r\nOn this day there were fewer water hazards, and the current of the\r\nenlarged river was so swift that they had little to do save to keep\r\nsteerageway on the birch-bark. Nevertheless, it was not all plain\r\nsailing. By the middle of the forenoon the course of the stream had\r\nchanged again to the northward, swinging around through a wide\r\nhalf-circle to the west, and this course, with its Hudson Bay\r\nthreatenings, was maintained throughout the remainder of the day.\r\n\r\nTheir night camp was made at the head of a series of rapids, the first\r\nof which, from the increased volume of the water, looked more perilous\r\nthan any they had yet attempted. It was late when they made camp and,\r\nthe darkness coming on quickly, they were prevented from reconnoitring.\r\nBut they had the thunder of the flood for music at their evening meal,\r\nand it was ominous.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that noise is telling us that we are to have no\r\nthoroughfare to-morrow,\" was the young woman's comment upon the thunder\r\nmusic. \"Let us hope it will be a short carry this time.\"\r\n\r\nPrime laughed. \"Isn't there a passage somewhere in the Bible about the\r\nback being fitted to its burden?\" he asked. Then he went on for her\r\nencouragement: \"It's all in the day's work, Lucetta-woman, and it is\r\ndoing you no end of good. The next time you are able to look into a\r\nmirror you won't know yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThough she had thought that she was by this time far beyond it, the\r\nyoung woman blushed a little under the rich outdoor brown.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'm not growing haggard and old?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, you are not!\" he asserted loyally. \"I'm the beauty of the\r\ntwo\"--passing a hand over the three weeks' growth of stubble beard on\r\nhis face. \"You are putting on weight every day. In another week your\r\nface will be as round as a full moon. It may not sound like it, but that\r\nwas meant for a compliment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was I too thin?\" she wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"Er--not precisely thin, perhaps; but a little strenuous. You gave me\r\nthe idea at first that Domestic Science, with gymnasium teaching on the\r\nside, had been a trifle too much for you. Had they?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I was perfectly fit. But one acquires the habit of living tensely\r\nin that other world that we have lost and can't find again. It is human\r\nto wish to make money, and then a little more money.\"\r\n\r\n\"What special use have you for a little more money?\" Prime asked\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n\"Travel,\" she said succinctly. \"I should like to see the world; all of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"That wouldn't take so very much money. Goodness knows, the pen isn't\r\nmuch of a mining-pick, but with it I have contrived to dig out a year in\r\nEurope.\"\r\n\r\n\"You couldn't have done it teaching the daughters of retired farmers how\r\nto cook rationally,\" she averred. \"Besides, my earning year is only nine\r\nmonths long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you really do want money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; not much money, but just enough. That is, if there is any such\r\nhalf-way stopping-point for the avaricious.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is,\" he asserted. \"I have found it for myself. I should like to\r\nhave money enough to enable me to write a book in the way a book ought\r\nto be written--in perfect leisure and without a single distracting\r\nthought of the royalty check. No man can do his best with one eye fixed\r\nfirmly upon the treasurer's office.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had never thought of that,\" she mused. \"I always supposed a writer\r\nworked under inspiration.\"\r\n\r\n\"So he does, the inspiration of the butcher and the baker and the\r\nanxious landlord. I can earn a living; I have done it for a number of\r\nyears; but it is only a living for one, and there isn't anything to put\r\naside against the writing of the leisurely book--or other things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! then you have other ambitions, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"The one ambition that every normal-minded man ought to have: I want a\r\nwife and babies and a home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you certainly need money,\" she laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Sure I do; but not too much--always remember that--not too much.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you call 'too much'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough to spoil the children and to make it unnecessary for me ever to\r\nwrite another line.\"\r\n\r\nThis time her laugh was mocking. \"Just now you said you wanted enough so\r\nthat you could write without thinking of money,\" she reminded him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there is a golden mean; it doesn't have to be all honey or all\r\nvinegar. A nice tidy little income that would provide at a pinch for\r\nthe butcher and the baker and the other people. You know what I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think I do; and my ambition is hardly more soaring than yours.\r\nAs you remarked, it doesn't cost so frightfully much to travel and live\r\nabroad.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her dubiously. \"You don't mean that you'd wish to travel\r\nall the time, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--er--I don't know precisely. But you'd want to settle down and have\r\na home some time, wouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"And cook for a man?\" she put in. \"Perhaps I haven't found the man.\"\r\n\r\nPrime's laugh was boyishly blatant.\r\n\r\n\"I notice you are cooking pretty assiduously for a man these days. But\r\nperhaps that is only in self-defense. If the man cooked for you you\r\nwouldn't live very long.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am merely doing my bit, as the English say,\" was the cool retort. \"I\r\nhaven't said that I like to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you do like to do it,\" he insisted. \"If you didn't, you couldn't\r\nhit it off so cheerfully. I know a thing or two, and what I don't know\r\nI am learning. You are a perfectly normal woman, Lucetta, and normality\r\ndoesn't mean continuous travel.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have changed your mind again. Last week you were calling me\r\nabnormal, and saying that you had never met a woman like me before.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hadn't; but that was my misfortune. I hope there are a good many like\r\nyou; I've got to hope it for the sake of humanity and the good of the\r\nrace. But this talk isn't getting us anywhere. We had better turn in;\r\nthere is a hard day ahead of us tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nIn the morning the prophecy seemed destined to fulfil itself in heaping\r\nmeasure. While Lucetta was getting breakfast Prime took to the woods and\r\nmade a careful survey of some portion of the hazards ahead. He was gone\r\nfor the better part of an hour, and when he came back his report was not\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\n\"Worse and more of it,\" was the way he described the difficulties. \"It\r\nis just one rapid after another, as far as I went; and that must have\r\nbeen a mile and a half or more. Coming back, I kept to the river bank,\r\nand tried to imagine us picking the way between the rocks in the\r\nchannel. I believe we can do it if you have the nerve to try.\"\r\n\r\n\"If _I_ have the nerve?\" she flung back. \"Is that a revival of the sex\r\nidea?\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he hastened to say. \"It was simply a manner of\r\nspeaking. Your nerve is like the rest of you--superb. We'll shoot the\r\nrapids if it takes a leg. It would ask for more than a leg to make the\r\ncarry.\"\r\n\r\nA little later they loaded the canoe carefully for the greater hazard,\r\npacking the dunnage securely and protecting the meal and the flour as\r\nwell as they could by wrapping them tightly in the canvas roll. Past\r\nthis, they cut strips from the remaining scraps of deerskin and tied\r\neverything, even to the utensils, the guns, and the axe, to the braces,\r\ntaking time to make their preparations thorough.\r\n\r\nIt was well that they took the time while they had it. After the\r\nbirch-bark had been headed into the first of the rapids there was no\r\ntime for anything but the strenuous fight for life. Faster and still\r\nfaster the frail craft leaped on its way, down one rapid and into\r\nanother before they could congratulate themselves upon the latest\r\nhairbreadth dodging of the thickly strewn boulders.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time in the brief respites Prime shouted encouragement to\r\nhis canoe-mate. \"Keep it up--it can't last forever! We're doing nobly.\r\nLook out for this big beggar just ahead!\"\r\n\r\nSo it went on, from bad to worse and then to bad again, but never with a\r\nchance for a landing or a moment's rest from the engrossing vigilance.\r\nPrime gasped and was thankful that there were days of sharp\r\nmuscle-hardening behind them to fit them for this crowning test. He was\r\nsure he could measure Lucetta's fortitude by his own. So long as he\r\ncould endure the strain he knew he could count upon hearing the steady\r\ndip of her paddle keeping time with his own.\r\n\r\nBut the worst of the worst was yet to come. At the foot of a series of\r\nrapids which were like a steeply descending stair, they found themselves\r\nin a sluiceway where the enlarged river ran like a torrent in flood. On\r\nthe still air of the summer day a hoarse clamor was rising to warn them\r\nthat there was a cataract ahead. Prime's cry of alarm was not needed.\r\nWith the first backing dip of the paddle he felt the braking impulse at\r\nthe stern striking in with his own.\r\n\r\n\"Hold her!\" he shouted. \"We've got to make the shore, if it smashes us!\"\r\nBut the puny strength of the two pairs of arms was as nothing when\r\npitted against the onsweep of the mighty flood. For a brief instant the\r\ndownward rush of the canoe was checked; then it was caught in a whirling\r\neddy and spun end for end as if upon a pivot. When it straightened up\r\nfor the leap over the shallow fall it was headed the wrong way, and a\r\nmoment later the crash came.\r\n\r\nThe young woman was the only one of the two who knew definitely what\r\nfollowed. In the tipping glide over the brink they were both thrown out\r\nof the canoe and spilled into the whirlpool at the foot of the cataract.\r\nLucetta kept her head sufficiently to remember that Prime could not\r\nswim, and when she came up from the plunge she saw him, and saw that he\r\nwas not struggling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Hold her!\" he shouted. \"We've got to make the shore, if\r\nit smashes us!\"]\r\n\r\nTwo quick strokes enabled her to get her fingers in his hair, and then\r\nbegan a battle in which the strength of the single free arm had to match\r\nitself against the swirling current of the whirlpool. Twice, and yet\r\nonce again, the young woman and her helpless burden were swept around\r\nthe circle, each time drawing a little nearer to the recurving eddy\r\nunder the fall. Lucetta knew well enough that a second ingulfing under\r\nthe cataract meant death for both, and at the beginning of the fourth\r\ncircling she made the supreme effort, winning the desperate battle and\r\nstruggling out upon the low shingly bank of the pool, to fall exhausted\r\nwhen she had dragged her unconscious canoe-mate out of the water.\r\n\r\nAfter a dazed minute or two she was able to sit up and realize the\r\nextent of the disaster. The canoe had disappeared after its leap into\r\nthe pool, and she did not know what had become of it. And Prime was\r\nlying just as the dragging rescue had left him, with his arms flung\r\nwide. His eyes were closed, and his face, under the three weeks' growth\r\nof stubble beard, was haggard and drawn. In the dive over the fall he\r\nhad struck his head, and the blood was oozing slowly from a great bruise\r\non his forehead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X\r\n\r\n                                HORRORS\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is a trite saying that even the weakest strand in the cable never\r\nknows how much it can pull until the demanding strain comes. As a young\r\nwoman with athletic leanings, Lucetta had had arduous drillings in\r\nfirst-aid, and had drilled others. If Prime had been merely drowned she\r\nwould have known precisely what to do. But the broken head was a\r\ndifferent matter.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when her own exhaustion was a little assuaged, she essayed\r\nthe first-aid. Dragging the hapless one a little farther from the\r\nwater's edge, she knelt beside him to examine the wound with fingers\r\nthat trembled a little as they pressed, in spite of the brave diagnostic\r\nresolution. There was no skull fracture, but she had no means of\r\ndetermining how serious the concussion was. Prime was breathing heavily,\r\nand the bruise was already beginning to puff up and discolor.\r\n\r\nWith hope still in abeyance, she worked swiftly. Warmth was the first\r\nnecessity. Her hands were shaking when she felt in the pocket of Prime's\r\ncoat for the precious bottle of matches. Happily it was unbroken, and\r\nshe could have wept for joy. There was plenty of fuel at hand, and in a\r\nfew minutes she had a fire blazing brightly, before which she propped\r\nthe wounded man to dry out, though his wet clothing gave him a\r\nsweltering steam bath before the desiccating process began. It was\r\nheroic treatment, but there was no alternative, and by the time she had\r\nhim measurably dried and warm, her own soggy discomfort was also\r\nabating.\r\n\r\nHaving done what she could, her situation was still as forlorn as it\r\ncould well be; she was alone in the heart of the forest wilderness with\r\na wounded man, who might live or die as the chance should befall--and\r\nthere was no food. She set her face determinedly against the erosive\r\nimpatience of despair. There was nothing to do but to wait with what\r\nfortitude she could muster.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon dragged on interminably, and to make the prospect more\r\ndispiriting the sky clouded over and the sun disappeared. Toward\r\nevening Prime began to stir restlessly and to mutter in a sort of feeble\r\ndelirium. The young woman hailed this as a hopeful symptom, and yet the\r\nmutterings of the unconscious man were inexpressibly terrifying. What if\r\nthe recovery should be only of the body and not of the mind?\r\n\r\nAs the dusk began to gather, Lucetta found her strong resolution ebbing\r\nin spite of all she could do. The thunder of the near-by cataract\r\ndeafened her, and the darkling shadows of the forest were thickly shot\r\nwith unnerving suggestions. To add the finishing touch, her mind\r\nconstantly reverted to the story of the finding and disposal of the two\r\ndead men and she could not drive the thought away. In a short time it\r\nbecame a frenzied obsession, and she found herself staring wildly in a\r\nsort of hypnotic trance at the waterfall, fully expecting to see one or\r\nboth of the dead bodies come catapulting over it.\r\n\r\nWhile it was still light enough to enable her to distinguish things\r\ndimly, something did come over the fall, a shapeless object about the\r\nsize of a human body, shooting clear of the curving water wall, to drop\r\nwith a sullen splash into the whirlpool. Lucetta covered her eyes with\r\nher hands and shrieked. It was the final straw, and she made sure her\r\nsanity was going.\r\n\r\nShe was still gasping and trembling when she heard a voice, and\r\nventuring to look she saw that Prime was sitting up and holding his head\r\nin his hands. The revulsion from mad terror to returning sanity was so\r\nsudden and overpowering that she wanted to go to him and fall on her\r\nknees and hug him merely because he was a man and alive, and hadn't died\r\nto leave her alone with the frightful horrors.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I--didn't I hear you scream?\" he mumbled, twisting his tongue to\r\nthe words with the utmost difficulty. And then: \"What on earth has\r\nhappened to me? I feel--as if--I had been run through--a\r\nthreshing-machine.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were pitched out of the canoe and hurt,\" she told him. \"I--I was\r\nafraid you were going to die!\"\r\n\r\n\"Was that why you screamed?\" The words were still foolishly hard to\r\nfind and still harder to set in order.\r\n\r\nAt this she cried out again, and again covered her eyes. \"No--no! It is\r\nthere yet--in the whirlpool--one of the--one of the dead men!\"\r\n\r\nThough Prime was still scarcely more than half conscious of his\r\ncondition and cripplings, the protective instinct was clamoring to be\r\nheard, dinning in his ears to make him realize that his companion was a\r\nwoman, and that her miraculous courage had for some cause reached its\r\nultimate limit. With a brand from the fire for a torch, he crept half\r\nmechanically on hands and knees to the edge of the bowl-like whirlpool.\r\nIn due time he had a glimpse of a black object circling past in the\r\nfroth and spume, and he threw the firebrand at it. A moment later he was\r\nsetting the comforting prop of explanation under Lucetta's toppling\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing but a log--just a broken log of wood,\" he assured her.\r\n\"Forget it, and tell me more about how I came to get this bushel-basket\r\nhead of mine. It aches like sin!\"\r\n\r\nShe described the plunge of the unmanageable canoe over the fall and its\r\nimmediate consequences, minifying her own part in the rescue.\r\n\r\n\"You needn't try to wiggle out of it,\" he said soberly at the end of the\r\nbrief recounting. \"You saved my life. If you hadn't pulled me out, I'd\r\nbe down there in that pool right now, going round and round like that\r\nbally log of wood. What do you charge for saving a man's life, Lucetta?\"\r\n\r\n\"A promise from the man to be more careful in future. But we mustn't\r\nslide back into the artificial things, Donald. For all you know, my\r\nmotive might have been altogether selfish--perhaps it was selfish. My\r\nfirst thought was a screaming horror of being left alone here in this\r\nwilderness. It made me fight, _fight_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that the truth, Lucetta?\" he inquired solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"Y-yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"All of the truth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, perhaps not quite all. There is such a thing as the life-saving\r\ninstinct, isn't there? Even dogs have it sometimes. Of course I\r\ncouldn't very well swim out and leave you to drown.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he put in definitively, \"you couldn't--and what's more, you hadn't\r\nthe first idea of doing such a thing. And that other thing you told me\r\nwas only to relieve my sense of obligation. You haven't relieved it--not\r\nan ounce. And I don't care to have it relieved. Let it go for the time\r\nbeing, and tell me what became of the canoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the faintest notion. I didn't see it again after we went over\r\nthe fall. Of course it is smashed and ruined and lost, and we are\r\nperfectly helpless again.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long minute Prime sat with his throbbing head in his hands, trying\r\nto think connectedly. When he looked up it was to say: \"We are in a\r\npretty bad box, Lucetta, with the canoe gone and nothing to eat. It is\r\nhammering itself into what is left of my brain that we can't afford to\r\nsit still and wait for something to turn up. If we push on down river we\r\nmay find the canoe or the wreck of it, and there will surely be some\r\nlittle salvage. I don't believe the birch-bark would sink, even if it\r\nwere full of water.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not able to push on,\" she interposed quickly. \"As it is, you\r\ncan hardly hold your head up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can do whatever it is needful to do,\" he declared, unconsciously\r\ngiving her a glimpse of the strong thread in the rather loosely woven\r\nfabric of his character. \"I have always been able to do what I had to\r\ndo. Let's start out at once.\"\r\n\r\nWith a couple of firebrands for torches they set out down the river\r\nbank, following the stream closely and keeping a sharp lookout for the\r\nwreck. Before they had gone very far, however, the blinding headache got\r\nin its work, and Prime began to stumble. It was at Lucetta's insistence\r\nthat they made another halt and gave up the search for the night.\r\n\r\n\"It is no manner of use,\" she argued. \"You are not able to go on; and,\r\nbesides, we can't see well enough to make sure that we are not passing\r\nthe thing we are looking for. We had much better stop right where we are\r\nand wait for daylight.\"\r\n\r\nThe halt was made in a small opening in the wood, and the young woman\r\npersuaded Prime to lie down while she gathered the material for another\r\ncamp-fire. Almost as soon as it was kindled Prime dropped off into a\r\nheavy sleep. Lucetta provided fuel to last through the night, and then\r\nsat down with her back to a tree, determined to stay awake and watch\r\nwith the sick man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XI\r\n\r\n                        \"A CRACKLING OF THORNS\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGH she had formed her resolution with a fair degree of\r\nself-reliance, Lucetta Millington soon found that she had set herself a\r\ntask calling for plenty of fortitude and endurance. Beyond the circle of\r\nfirelight the shadows of the forest gloomed forbiddingly. They had seen\r\nbut little of the wild life of the woods in their voyagings thus far,\r\nbut now it seemed to be stirring uneasily on all sides of the lonely\r\ncamp-fire.\r\n\r\nOnce some large-hoofed animal went crashing through the underbrush\r\ntoward the river; and again there were other hoof-beats stopping\r\nabruptly at a little distance from the clearing. Lucetta, shading her\r\neyes from the glow of the fire, saw two gleaming disks of light shining\r\nin the blackness of the backgrounding forest. Her reason told her that\r\nthey were the eyes of the animal; that the unnerving apparition was\r\nprobably a deer halted and momentarily fascinated by the sight of the\r\nfire. But the incident was none the less alarming to the town-bred young\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nLater there were softly padding footfalls, and these gave her a sharper\r\nshock. She knew next to nothing about the fauna of the northern woods,\r\nnor did she have the comforting knowledge that the largest of the\r\nAmerican cats, the panther, rarely attacks a human being unless wounded,\r\nor under the cruelest stress of winter hunger. Breathlessly she listened\r\nand watched, and presently she saw the eyes of the padding intruder\r\nglowing like balls of lambent green fire. Whereupon it was all she could\r\ndo to keep from shrieking frantically and waking her companion.\r\n\r\nAfter the terrifying green eyes had vanished it occurred to her to\r\nwonder why they had seen and heard so little of the night prowlers at\r\ntheir former camps. The reason was not far to seek. Days well filled\r\nwith toil and stirring excitement had been followed by nights when sleep\r\ncame quickly and was too sound to be disturbed by anything short of a\r\ncataclysm.\r\n\r\nAs midnight drew near, Prime began to mutter disconnectedly. Lucetta\r\ndid not know whether he was talking in his sleep or whether he had\r\nbecome delirious again, but at all events this new development\r\nimmeasurably increased the uncanny weirdness of the night-watch. Though\r\nmany of the vaporings were mere broken sentences without rhyme or\r\nreason, enough of them were sufficiently clear to shadow forth a sketchy\r\nstory of Prime's life.\r\n\r\nLucetta listened because she could not well help it, being awake and\r\nalert and near at hand. Part of the time Prime babbled of his boyhood on\r\nthe western New York farm, and she gathered that some of the bits were\r\ncurious survivals of doubtless long-forgotten talks with his\r\ngrandfather. Breaking abruptly with these earlier scenes, the wandering\r\nunderthought would skip to the mystery, charging it now to Watson Grider\r\nand again calling it a blessed miracle. With another abrupt change the\r\nbabbler would be in Europe, living over again his trampings in the\r\nTyrol, which, it seemed, had been taken in the company of an older man,\r\na German, who was a Heidelberg professor.\r\n\r\nFarther along, after an interval of silence in which Lucetta began to\r\nhope that the talkative fit had passed, Prime broke out again--this time\r\nwaxing eloquent over his struggles in New York as a beginner in the\r\nwriting trade. Here there were revelations to make her sorry that she\r\nwas obliged to listen; for years, it seemed, the fight had gone\r\ndiscouragingly hard with him; there had been times when he had had to\r\nchoose between giving up in defeat or going hungry.\r\n\r\nLucetta pieced together a pitiful little story of this starving time.\r\nSome one--once Prime called the some one Grider, and later gave him\r\nanother name--had tempted the struggler with an offer of a comfortable\r\nincome, the single condition precedent being an abandonment of the\r\nliterary fight. Prime's mutterings made the outcome plain for the\r\nlistener on the opposite side of the camp-fire: \"No, I couldn't sell\r\nsoap; it's honest enough, no doubt--and decent enough--everybody ought\r\nto use soap. But I've set my hand to the plough--no, that isn't it....\r\nOh, dammit, Peter, you know what I mean; I can't turn back; that is the\r\none thing I've never learned how to do. No, and I can't take your money\r\nas a loan; that would be only another way of confessing defeat. No, by\r\nGeorge, I won't go out to dinner with you, either!\"\r\n\r\nLucetta wept a little in sheer sympathy. Her own experience had not been\r\ntoo easy. Left an orphan while she was still too young to teach, she\r\nknew what it meant to set the heart upon a definite end and to strive\r\nthrough thick and thin to reach it. She was relieved when Prime began to\r\ntalk less coherently of other incidents in his life in the great\r\nmetropolis. There were more references to Grider, and at last something\r\nthat figured as Prime's part in a talk with the barbarian. \"Yes, by\r\nJove, Watson, the scoundrels tried to pull my leg; actually advertised\r\nfor me in the _Herald_. No, of course, I didn't fall for it. I know\r\nperfectly well what it was ... same old gag about the English estate\r\nwith no resident heirs in sight. No, the ad. didn't say so, but I know.\r\nWhat's that?--I'm a liar? Like Zeke I am!\"\r\n\r\nThere were more of the vaporings, but neither these nor the young\r\nwoman's anxiety about the wounded man's condition were disturbing\r\nenough at the last to keep her eyelids from drooping and her senses from\r\nfluttering over the brink of the sleep abyss. Once she bestirred herself\r\nto put more fuel on the fire, but after that the breeze blew the\r\nmosquitoes away, the warmth from the upleaping blaze added its touch,\r\nand she fell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke the sun had risen and Prime was up and mending the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Better,\" he said cheerfully, in answer to her instant question. \"Much\r\nbetter; though my head reminds me of the day when I got the check for my\r\nfirst story--pretty badly swelled, you know. But after I've had a good\r\ncup of hot tea\"--he stopped in mid-career with a wry laugh. \"Bless my\r\nfool heart! If I hadn't totally forgotten that we haven't any tea or\r\nanything else! And here I've been up a quarter of an hour and more,\r\ntrying to get a good cooking-fire started! Where were we when we left\r\noff last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had set out to search for the wreck of the canoe,\" she explained,\r\nrising to stand before the fire. \"We came this far, and concluded it\r\nwas no use trying to go on in the dark. You were pretty badly off, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's coming back to me, a little at a time and often, as the cat\r\nremarked when it ate the grindstone,\" he went on, determined to make her\r\nsmile if it were within the bounds of possibility. He knew she must have\r\nhad a bad night of it, and the brightness of the gray eyes told him that\r\neven now she was not very far from tears. \"Don't cry,\" he added\r\nabruptly; \"it's all over now.\"\r\n\r\nHer laugh was the sort that harbors next door to pathos.\r\n\r\n\"I'm hungry!\" she said plaintively. \"We had no dinner yesterday, and no\r\nsupper last night, and there doesn't seem to be any very brilliant\r\nprospect for breakfast this morning.\"\r\n\r\nPrime put his hand to his bruised head as if to satisfy himself that it\r\nwas all there.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you ever gone without a meal before for the raw reason that you\r\ncouldn't get it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not since I can remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have; and it's bad medicine--mighty bad medicine. We'll put the fire\r\nout and move on. While there's life there's hope; and our hope this\r\nmorning is that we are going to find the wreck of that canoe. Let's\r\nhike.\"\r\n\r\nThey set out courageously, keeping close to the bank of the river and\r\nscanning every eddy and backwater as they moved along. For this cause\r\ntheir progress was slow, and it was nearly or quite noon when they came\r\nto a quiet reach in the river, a placid pond with great trees\r\noverhanging its margins and wide stretches of reeds and bulrushes\r\ngrowing in the shallows. And on the opposite side of the pond-like\r\nexpanse and apparently grounded among the bulrushes they saw their\r\ncanoe. It was bottom side up with care, and on the wrong side of the\r\nriver; also they knew that its lading, if any of this had survived the\r\nrunaway flight, must be soaked and sodden. But the triumphant fact\r\nremained--the canoe was found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XII\r\n\r\n                        IN SEARCH OF AN ANCESTOR\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR a moment neither of them spoke. Then Prime broke out in a sardonic\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"That is a heavenly prospect for dinner, supper, breakfast, and dinner\r\nall rolled into one, isn't it, now? If there is anything left in the\r\ncanoe, it's soaked to a pulp--to say nothing of the fact that we can't\r\nget to it. How are we going to raft ourselves over there without the\r\naxe?\"\r\n\r\nLucetta went down to the margin of the pond-like reach and tested its\r\ndepth with a tossed stone.\r\n\r\n\"It is deep,\" she said, \"swimming-deep. The shallows must be all on the\r\nother side.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go down-stream a piece and see if there isn't some place where I\r\ncan wade,\" Prime offered. But at this she shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"We passed out of all the wading depths days and days ago. If you will\r\nmake a fire, I'll swim over and get the canoe.\"\r\n\r\nPrime had a world of objections to offer to this, and he flung them into\r\nthe breach one after another. It was no woman's job. The water was cold,\r\nand it would be a long swim--for a guess, not less than a hundred yards;\r\nshe had gone without food so long that she was not fit for it; if she\r\nshould try it and fail, he would have to go in after her, and that would\r\nmean suicide for both of them.\r\n\r\nShe heard him through with a quaint little lip-curl of amusement at his\r\nfertility in obstacle raising, and at the end calmly fished the remains\r\nof his handkerchief out of his pocket and bound it about her head.\r\n\r\n\"Another attack of the undying protective instinct,\" she retorted\r\nlight-heartedly. \"You go on and make the fire and I'll save the wreck,\r\nor what there is left of it.\" Whereupon she walked away up-stream,\r\nlosing herself shortly for Prime in a thicket beyond the first bend of\r\nthe river above.\r\n\r\nPrime fell to work gathering fuel, feeling less like a man than at any\r\ntime since the voyage had begun. It stabbed his _amour-propre_ to the\r\nheart to be compelled to let her take the man's part while he did the\r\nsquaw's. But there seemed to be no help for it.\r\n\r\nWhile he was kindling the fire he heard a plunge, and a little later saw\r\nthe coifed head making diagonally across from the upper bend toward the\r\ncanoe. She was swimming easily with the side stroke, and he could see\r\nthe rhythmical flash and swing of a white arm as she made the overhand\r\nreach. Then he dutifully turned his back and gave his entire attention\r\nto the firemaking.\r\n\r\nWhen he looked again she had righted the canoe and was coming across\r\nwith it, swimming and pushing it ahead of her. At a little distance from\r\nthe shore she called to him: \"Take it; it's all yours\"--giving the\r\nbirch-bark a final shove. \"I'll be with you in a few minutes.\" And with\r\nthat she turned off and swam away up-stream to her dressing-thicket.\r\n\r\nPrime gave her time to disappear and then went to draw the canoe out on\r\nthe bank and to begin an inventory of the losses. Thanks to the care\r\nthey had taken in tying everything in, nothing was missing save the\r\npaddles. Such food as was still in the original tin was undamaged, but\r\nthe meat was soaked and the flour and meal were soggy masses of paste.\r\nPrime was dismayed. The small stock of potatoes would not last forever,\r\nand neither would the canned vegetables. They were not yet backwoodsmen\r\nenough to live upon meat alone; and another and crowning misfortune was\r\nthe loss of the salt.\r\n\r\nPrime was lamenting over the wet salt-sack and trying to save some\r\nlittle portion of the precious condiment when Lucetta came on the scene,\r\nlooking as bright and fresh as the proverbial field-flower after her\r\nplunge and swim, and took over the culinary problem. Fortunately, they\r\nstill had the salt pork, and the pretty _cuisiniere_ issued her orders\r\npromptly.\r\n\r\n\"Find some nice clean pieces of birch bark and spread this flour and\r\nmeal out so that it will dry before the fire,\" she directed; and while\r\nhe was doing that and hanging the blankets and tent canvas up to drip\r\nand dry, she opened a tin of baked beans and made another of the\r\ntriumphant stews of jerked deer meat and potatoes seasoned with a bit\r\nof the salt pork. Upon these two dishes they presently feasted royally,\r\nmaking up for the three lost meals, and missing the bread only because\r\nthey didn't have it.\r\n\r\n\"I have settled one thing in my own mind,\" Prime declared, while he was\r\nassiduously drying a leaf of the soaked tobacco for the after-dinner\r\nsmoke. \"If I am ever cast away again, I'm going to make dead sure that I\r\nhave a Domestic Science expert for a fellow sufferer. Lucetta, you are\r\nsimply great when it comes to making something out of nothing. What are\r\nwe going to do with this flour-and-meal pudding?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are going to dry it carefully and then grind it up again on a flat\r\nstone and go on as before,\" was the cheerful reply. \"That is my part of\r\nit, and yours will be a good bit harder; you will have to make some new\r\npaddles and contrive some way to patch that big hole in the canoe.\"\r\n\r\nPrime laughed hilariously. His head was still aching, but the disaster\r\nhad fallen so far short of the ultimate fatalities that the small\r\ndiscomforts were as nothing.\r\n\r\n\"I can imagine both the paddles and the patch,\" he boasted. \"It remains\r\nto be seen whether or not I can turn them into serviceable realities.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the dunnage was drying and Lucetta was regrinding her flour and\r\nmeal Indian-fashion on a smooth stone, Prime hacked manfully at a small\r\nspruce and finally got it down. It took him the better part of the\r\nafternoon to split the tree with wooden wedges and to get out two pieces\r\nto be hewn roughly with the axe into the paddle shape. Over the evening\r\nfire he whittled laboriously with the sharper of the two hunting-knives,\r\nand when the knife grew dull he learned by patient trial to whet it on a\r\nbit of stone. To keep him company, Lucetta had recourse to the fish-bone\r\nneedle. Her clothes had not come scathless out of the cataract disaster\r\nand its aftermath.\r\n\r\n\"You have one of the best of the good qualities, Donald,\" she said,\r\nmarking the patience with which the whittling went on. \"You are not\r\nafraid to buckle down to the necessity and keep on trying.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Patient continuance in well-doing,'\" he quoted, grinning. \"I learned\r\nthat, up one side and down the other, in the writing trade. It is about\r\nthe only thing that gets you anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had a hard time making your start in the writing, didn't you?\" she\r\noffered.\r\n\r\n\"When did I ever tell you that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You told me something about it the first day we were together, and a\r\ngood bit more last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh! Talking in my sleep, was I? What did I say?\"\r\n\r\n\"A lot of things; I can't remember them all. You talked about Mr.\r\nGrider, and the mystery, and the dead men, and I don't know what all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say anything about the girl, did I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a word,\" she returned.\r\n\r\n\"For the best possible reason on earth, Lucetta: there hasn't been any\r\ngirl. You don't believe that, I suppose. You wouldn't believe it of any\r\nman of my age, and--and temperament?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet you said night before last that you wanted a wife and children and\r\na home. Doesn't that presuppose a girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my case it presupposes a handsomely imaginary girl; I'm great on the\r\nimaginary things.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does she look like--this imaginary girl of yours?\"\r\n\r\nHe glanced up from the paddle-whittling. \"Some day, when we get back\r\ninto the world again, I'll show you what she looks like. Can you wait\r\nuntil then?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't leave me any choice.\"\r\n\r\n\"We ran off the track,\" he went on, after a little interval of silence.\r\n\"You were telling me what I talked about last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; I have forgotten most of it, as I said; but along at the last\r\nthere were a good many disjointed things about your fight for\r\nrecognition. Once, I remember, you were talking to somebody about soap.\"\r\n\r\nPrime's laugh was a guffaw.\r\n\r\n\"I can laugh at it now,\" he chuckled; \"but it was mighty binding at the\r\ntime--that soap incident. I was down in a hole, in the very bottom of\r\nthe hole. I had written a book and couldn't get it published; couldn't\r\nget anybody to touch it with a ten-foot pole. I had friends who were\r\nwilling to lend me money to go on with, and one who offered me a job\r\nwriting advertisements for his soap factory. It was horribly tempting,\r\nbut when I was built, the ability to let go, even of a failure, was left\r\nout. So I didn't become an ad. writer. What else did I say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a lot of things that didn't make sense; one of them was about an\r\nadvertisement you said you had seen in the _New York Herald_. I couldn't\r\nmake out what it was; something about an English estate.\"\r\n\r\nPrime looked up quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it odd how these perfectly inconsequent things bury themselves\r\nsomewhere in the human brain, to rise up and sneak out some time when\r\nthe bars happen to be left down,\" he speculated. \"There was such an ad.,\r\nand I saw it; but I don't believe I have given it a second thought from\r\nthat time to this.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you spoke of it last night, you seemed to be telling Mr. Grider\r\nabout it. Was it addressed to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was addressed to the heirs of Roger Prime, of Batavia, and Roger\r\nPrime was my father. If I remember correctly, the advertisers gave a\r\nCanadian address--Ottawa, I think--and the 'personal' was worded in the\r\nusual fashion: 'If the heirs of Roger Prime will apply'--and so on; you\r\nknow how they go. It was the old leg-pull.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't quite understand,\" she demurred. \"What do you mean by\r\n'leg-pull'?\"\r\n\r\n\"The swindle is so venerable that it ought to have whiskers by this\r\ntime. Every once in a while a rumor leaks out that some great estate has\r\nbeen left in England, or somewhere else across the water, with no native\r\nheirs. You or I, if we happen to have a family name that fits in, are\r\ninvited to contribute to a sum which is being made up to pay the cost of\r\nestablishing the rights of the American descendants, and there you are.\r\nI suppose hundreds of thousands of dollars have been buncoed out of\r\ncredulous Americans in that way, first and last.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you could remember the Canadian address which you say you think\r\nwas Ottawa,\" rejoined the young woman reflectively.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I saw in a Cleveland newspaper an advertisement of the same\r\nnature, addressed to the heirs of the body of Clarissa Millington, born\r\nBradford. Clarissa Millington was my mother. There was no name signed,\r\nbut a business address was given, and it was in Ottawa.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have forgotten the address?\" said Prime.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't try to remember it. I wrote it down, and I have it in my\r\nluggage in Quebec.\"\r\n\r\nThe paddle-maker looked up with an accusing laugh.\r\n\r\n\"You were planning to return from Quebec by way of Ottawa; you were\r\ngoing to give those sharks some of your hard-earned teaching money.\r\nDon't deny it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't,\" she confessed. \"I meant to do that very thing. And I thought\r\nI had plenty of time. There was a date limit set in the advertisement,\r\nand it was July thirty-first. Do you think it was a swindle?\"\r\n\r\n\"There isn't the least doubt of it. Your kidnapping has saved you some\r\nmoney. The date limit was merely to make you hustle. I have seen the\r\ngame worked before, and it is very plausible. And since it is usually\r\nworked from Canada, a citizen of the United States has no recourse in\r\nlaw. You had a narrow escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"We may call it that, anyway,\" was the young woman's reply. \"The\r\nthirty-first of July will probably be nothing more than a memory by the\r\ntime we find our way back to the world.\"\r\n\r\nA busy silence followed the dismissal of the subject, and then Lucetta\r\nbegan to tell about the various alarms she had had during the previous\r\nnight. \"All of which goes to prove that I am still the normal woman,\"\r\nshe concluded.\r\n\r\n\"You are a heroine, and one of these days I mean to put you in a book,\"\r\nPrime threatened. \"You saved my life yesterday and my self-respect\r\nto-day; and that is more than a man ought to expect from the most normal\r\nwoman in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your self-respect?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; you heard me babbling all night, and you have been good-hearted\r\nenough not to report anything that a man need be ashamed of.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't say anything to be ashamed of,\" she returned quickly. \"Most\r\nof the talk was about the old farm near Batavia; that and your\r\ngrandfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grandfather Bankhead,\" he mused; \"they don't make any finer characters\r\nnowadays than he was--or as fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bankhead?\" she asked suddenly; \"was that your grandfather's name?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was: Abner Greenlow Bankhead. It is not such a very usual name. Have\r\nyou ever heard it before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Heard it? Why--why, it was my mother's mother's maiden name! She was a\r\nBankhead, and she married Josiah Greenlow Bradford!\"\r\n\r\nPrime dropped both paddle and knife.\r\n\r\n\"Well--wouldn't that jar you!\" he exclaimed. \"Can it be possible\r\nthat--hold on a minute; my grandfather had a Bankhead cousin who grew up\r\nin the family, and she married and moved to Ohio, away along back in the\r\nother century. What was your grandmother's Christian name?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was an old-fashioned one--Lorinda. I can remember her indistinctly\r\nas a little old lady with white hair and the brightest possible blue\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\nPrime was wagging his head as one in a daze. \"It is too wonderful to be\r\ntrue, Lucetta! But it must be true. My grandfather's cousin's name was\r\nLorinda, and I can remember seeing an oil portrait of her, a horrible\r\nthing done by some local artist, hanging in the old farmhouse at\r\nBatavia. I can't figure it out, but the way it is working around, we\r\nought to be cousins of some sort. Can you believe it?\"\r\n\r\nThe young woman put her mending aside to trace the relationship\r\nthoughtfully, counting the generations on her finger-tips. When she had\r\nfinally determined to her own satisfaction that they really had a common\r\nancestor four generations back, she laughed.\r\n\r\n\"It is wonderful,\" she said; \"almost too wonderful to be true. But the\r\nwonder of it is completely overshadowed by the unbelievable coincidence\r\nwhich dropped us two, cousins and descendants of that far-away Bankhead,\r\ndown together on the beach of a forest lake in the wilds of the Canadian\r\nbackwoods--a lake that neither of us ever saw or heard of before. Will\r\nthe mysteries never end?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute; let's get it straight,\" Prime interposed. \"We are really\r\ncousins, aren't we? Don't you figure it out that way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Third cousins; yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to show me,\" he invited. \"Genealogy is like Sanskrit to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nShe proceeded to show him, and from that the talk drifted rather\r\nexcitedly into family reminiscences. After the manner of people who\r\nreally have ancestors, neither of them was able to remember many of the\r\ntraditions. Prime's recollections, indeed, stopped short with his\r\ngrandfather, but Lucetta knew a little more about the older generations,\r\nand she dug the individuals out one by one, offering them to Prime as\r\nspurs to further rememberings.\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't remember anything about Jabez,\" he said. \"And Elvira and\r\nElmina and John I never heard mentioned. Grandfather Bankhead had no\r\nnear relations that I know of except his brother Jasper and his cousin\r\nLorinda, who grew up with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I seem to remember something about grandmother's cousin Jasper,\"\r\nLucetta put in. \"Didn't something happen to him--something out of the\r\nusual?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" was the prompt reply. \"He disappeared--went to the Far West when\r\nhe was a young man and was never heard of afterward. Grandfather often\r\nwondered what had become of him, and in his later years spoke of him\r\nquite frequently.\"\r\n\r\nLucetta went on with her mending, the fish-bone needle making her\r\nprogress primitively slow. Prime got up and strolled down to the\r\nriver-bank. When he returned he went around to her side of the fire to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n\"I'm mighty glad we have found out that we are cousins, Lucetta; twice\r\nglad, for your sake. It makes things a bit easier for you, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\nShe did not look up.\r\n\r\n\"Why should it?\" she asked quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know; we have both been throwing tin cans and brickbats at\r\nthe conventions; but I haven't any idea that we have killed them off\r\npermanently. And they die harder in a woman than in a man. We have\r\njollied things along pretty well, so far, but that isn't saying that I\r\nhaven't known how hard it must have been for you. As matters stand now,\r\nI am your natural protector.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up with the quaint little smile that he had learned to know,\r\nto interpret, and to love.\r\n\r\n\"What difference does the relationship make, Donald, so long as you are\r\nwhat you are? And what difference would it make if you happened to be\r\nthe other kind of man?\"\r\n\r\nHe stood smiling down upon her with his hands in his pockets.\r\n\r\n\"Your trust is the most wonderful thing in this world, Lucetta--and the\r\nmost beautiful. I should have to be a much worse man than I have ever\r\ndared to be to do anything to spoil it,\" he said slowly, and with that\r\nhe went to set up her sleeping-tent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIII\r\n\r\n                             AT CAMP COUSIN\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIME whittled through the better part of the succeeding forenoon on the\r\npaddles, and for the midday bread Lucetta tried her domestic-science\r\nhand upon the dried and reground flour. Not to draw too fine a\r\ncomparison, the paddles were the better success, though the bread was\r\neatable. In the afternoon the man of all work, with Lucetta for\r\nconsulting engineer, tackled the broken canoe.\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of materials with which to make the repairs if they\r\nhad only known how to use them. Attempts to sew a patch of birch bark\r\nover the hole with threads drawn from the blanket were dismal failures.\r\nAt each of the thread punctures the patch would split and curl up most\r\nperversely; and when night came they had succeeded only in making a bad\r\nmatter slightly worse.\r\n\r\nAfter supper they put their heads together to become, if the oracles\r\nshould prove auspicious, inventors in this hitherto untried field.\r\n\r\n\"If we only had a few drops of Indian blood in us!\" Prime complained.\r\n\"What do you suppose they daub this bark thing with to make it\r\nwater-tight? It must be something they find in the woods.\"\r\n\r\nLucetta went over to the canoe, chipped a bit of the daubing from one of\r\nthe seams, and tasted it appraisingly.\r\n\r\n\"It tastes like spruce-gum,\" she offered; \"do you suppose it can be?\"\r\n\r\nPrime ate a little in his turn and confirmed the guess. \"That is about\r\nwhat it is,\" he decided. \"The next thing is to find out how they\r\ncontrive to get enough of it. I wonder if they tap the trees as we do\r\nsugar-maples?\"\r\n\r\n\"If we could find a tree that has been broken,\" Lucetta suggested. And\r\nthen: \"How have we managed to live so long without learning some of\r\nthese perfectly simple things, Cousin Donald?\"\r\n\r\n\"Too much education and too little instinct,\" he scoffed. \"To-morrow\r\nmorning I'll climb trees and become a gum-gatherer. It seems\r\ninexpressibly humbling to think that a small hole in a piece of birch\r\nbark is all that prevents us from going on our way rejoicing. Never\r\nmind, there is another day coming, and if there isn't, success or\r\nfailure won't make any considerable difference to either of us.\"\r\n\r\nBright and early the next morning they tried the spruce-gum experiment.\r\nPrime found that he could have plenty of it for the gathering, and when\r\nthey had a sufficient quantity they melted it in one of the empty\r\nvegetable tins and used it as a glue with which to make the patch\r\nadhere. The result was not entirely satisfactory. The melted gum\r\nhardened quickly, but it became so brittle that a touch would loosen it.\r\n\r\n\"This is where we set up a laboratory for original research,\" Lucetta\r\nsaid, laughing. \"I wonder if some more cooking would do it any good.\"\r\n\r\n\"'The ruling passion strong in death,'\" Prime quoted with good-natured\r\nsarcasm. \"You are a born cook. Let's try it.\"\r\n\r\nThey tried it and merely succeeded in making the product still more\r\nbrittle. They then tried adding a little grease from the fat pork to\r\nmake it more flexible, and that ruined it completely.\r\n\r\n\"Two civilized brains, college-trained to a piano-polish finish, and not\r\na single workable idea between them,\" Prime derided. \"It's\r\nhumiliating--disgusting!\"\r\n\r\n\"The brains are still available,\" asserted the undaunted one. \"Go and\r\nfind some pine pitch and we'll mix it with the spruce.\"\r\n\r\nThis experiment promised better success. A gluey mixture resulted that\r\nstuck, not only to the canoe body and the patch, but to their fingers\r\nand to everything it touched. Inventing still further, they contrived a\r\nrude clamp to hold the patch in place while it was drying, if by good\r\nhap the glue would consent to dry at all; and with the new paddles\r\nwhittled and scraped into shape, there was nothing to do but to wait\r\nupon the drying process.\r\n\r\nPrime spent the afternoon fishing, with the tackle found in one of the\r\ngun-cases, and was lucky enough to accumulate a noble string of trout.\r\nLucetta would not say what she was going to do, merely hinting that\r\nPrime's absence until supper-time would be a boon. Only the buzzard\r\nswinging in slow circles overhead could have told tales of the doing\r\nafter the young woman had obtained her meed of solitude in the little\r\nglade, and possibly the buzzard had seen a sufficient number of\r\nblanketed women washing clothes at a river brink not to be unduly\r\nstirred at the sight.\r\n\r\nLater, Prime came in to exhibit his string of fish with true sportsman's\r\npride, and again they feasted royally, forgetting their late\r\ntribulations, and looking forward half-regretfully to a resumption of\r\ntheir journey on the morrow.\r\n\r\n\"It is astonishing how rapidly one can revert to the cave-man type,\" was\r\nPrime's phrasing of the regret. \"I have been a person of pavements and\r\ncement walks all my life, as I suppose you have--of the paved streets\r\nand all that they stand for. Yet I shall go back to them with something\r\nlike reluctance. Shan't you?\"\r\n\r\nShe did not reply to the direct question.\r\n\r\n\"You speak as if you had some assurance that we are approaching the\r\npavements. Have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A bare hint. I fished along the river for about a mile down-stream,\r\nspying out the land--or the water--as I went, for future reference. We\r\ncan't claim this region by the right of discovery. Somebody has been\r\nhere before us.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't find a house?\" she ventured.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; nothing like that. But I did find the stump of a tree, and the\r\ntree had been felled with an axe. It wasn't recently; the stump was old\r\nand moss-grown. But it was axe work just the same.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed softly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know whether to be glad or sorry, Donald; for myself, I mean.\r\nOf course, you want to get back to your work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I?\" he inquired. \"I suppose I ought to want to. I left a book half\r\nfinished in my New York attic.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could you do that? I should think such work would be ruined by\r\nhaving a vacation come along and cut it in two.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was sick of it,\" he confessed frankly. \"It was another pen picture of\r\nthe artificialities, and I shall never finish it now. I'll write a\r\nbetter one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Staging it in a Canadian forest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Staging it among the realities, at least. And there shall be a real\r\nwoman this time.\"\r\n\r\nIn his new character of cousin-in-authority, Prime sent Lucetta early to\r\nbed to catch up on her arrears of sleep. After she had disappeared\r\nbehind the curtains of the small shelter-tent, he sat for a long time\r\nbefore the fire smoking the rank tobacco and letting his thoughts rove\r\nat will through the mazes of the strange adventure which had befallen\r\nhim and this distant cousin, of whose very existence he had been\r\nignorant.\r\n\r\nMore and more the mazes perplexed him, and the coincidences, if they\r\nwere coincidences, began to verge upon the fantastic or the miraculous.\r\nWas it by accident or design that they had both chanced to be in Quebec\r\nat the same time? If the plot were of Grider's concocting, did the\r\nbarbarian know of the cousinship beforehand? Prime was charitable enough\r\nto hope that he did. It made the brutal joke--if it were a joke--a\r\nlittle less criminal to suppose that Grider knew of the relationship.\r\n\r\nStill, it was all vastly incredible on any joking hypothesis. Taking\r\nthe most lenient view of it--that Grider had pre-arranged the assault\r\nupon their liberty and had hired the two half-breeds to pick them up and\r\nconvoy them out of the wilderness--it was unbelievable that the\r\nbarbarous one, with all of his known disregard for the common humanities\r\nwhere his Homeric sense of humor was involved, would have turned them\r\nover to the tender mercies of two semi-savages whose character had been\r\nsufficiently demonstrated by the manner of their death.\r\n\r\n\"It simply _can't_ have been Watson Grider,\" Prime mused over his sixth\r\ncigarette--he was rolling them now in the label paper of the vegetable\r\ntins, frugally soaked off and saved. \"If it had been his joke, he\r\nwouldn't have left it up in the air; he would have followed along to get\r\nthe good of it. But if it isn't Grider, who is it, and what is it all\r\nabout?\"\r\n\r\nThe riddle always worked around thus to the same tormenting question,\r\nwith no hint of an answer; and, as many times before, Prime was obliged\r\nto leave it hanging, like Mohammed's coffin, between heaven and earth.\r\nBut when he renewed the fire and rolled himself in his blankets for the\r\nnight, he was still casting about for some means of bringing it to\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nFiguring it out afterward, he was certain that he could not have been\r\nasleep for more than an hour or two before he was awakened, with the\r\necho of a noise like volley-firing of some sort still ringing in his\r\nears. His first impulse was to spring up, but the second, which was the\r\none he obeyed, was more in keeping with the new character development.\r\nDeftly freeing himself from the blanket wrappings, he reached over to\r\nmake sure that one of the guns could be caught up quickly, and lay\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\nFor some little time nothing happened, and the night silence of the\r\nforest was undisturbed. Just as he was beginning to think that it had\r\nbeen the mosquitoes, and not a noise, which had awakened him, and was\r\nabout to get up and renew the smudge which he had made to windward\r\nbefore turning in, he heard cautious footsteps as of some one\r\napproaching from the direction of the river.\r\n\r\nThe measured tread assured him that the footfalls were human, and his\r\nhold tightened mechanically upon the grip of the gun-stock. By this time\r\nhe was thinking quite clearly, and he told himself that the militant\r\nprecaution was doubtless unnecessary; that there was little chance that\r\nthe approaching intruder--any intruder who would be attracted by the\r\nlight of the camp-fire--would be unfriendly. Yet it was the part of\r\nprudence to be prepared.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment or two he was able to note that the approaching footsteps\r\nwere growing more cautious. At this he rolled over by imperceptible\r\ninchings to face toward the river, drawing the gun with him. It was\r\nuseless to try to penetrate the black shadows of the background. The\r\nfire had died down to a mass of glowing embers, its bedtime replenishing\r\nof dried wood blazing up fitfully only now and then to illumine a\r\nslightly wider circle. Prime saw nothing, and, for a time after the\r\nfootfalls ceased, heard nothing. But the next manifestation was\r\nstartling enough. At a moment when he was beginning to wonder if his\r\nimagination had been playing tricks on him, he heard a curious ripping\r\nsound coming, this time, from behind the inverted canoe.\r\n\r\nSilently he rose to his knees with the rifle held low. For shelter, in\r\ncase of a shower, the provisions had been placed under the inverted\r\nbirch-bark, and he decided instantly that the intruder was trying to\r\nsteal them. Not wishing to alarm Lucetta, he got upon his feet and\r\nwalked toward the canoe, meaning to put the man behind it between\r\nhimself and the firelight.\r\n\r\nThe manoeuvre was never completed. Before he had taken half a dozen\r\nsteps a blinding flashlight was turned upon him from behind the canoe,\r\nand it stopped him as suddenly as if the dazzling radiance had been a\r\nvolley from a machine-gun. But the stopping shock was only momentary.\r\nDashing forward around the end of the canoe, he had a glimpse of a\r\nbig-bodied man in a golf cap and sweater crashing his way through the\r\nundergrowth toward the river, and promptly gave chase.\r\n\r\n\"Grider!--Watson!\" he called, but there was no reply. The intruder, as\r\nhe ran, had the benefit of his flashlight; Prime could see the momentary\r\ngleams as the runner took a diagonal course which would bring him out a\r\nhundred yards down-stream from a point directly opposite the camp-fire.\r\n\r\nPrime collided with a tree, stumbled and fell, and sprang up to call\r\nagain. The retreating footfalls were no longer audible, but now there\r\nwas another cacophony of noise--the sputtering exhausts of a\r\nmotor-boat--and Prime reached the river-bank in time to see the dark\r\nshape of the power-driven craft losing itself in the starlight in its\r\nswift rush down the river.\r\n\r\nIn the first flush of his rage at what figured as a second heartless\r\ndesertion, Prime was strongly tempted to open fire on the retreating\r\nmotor-boat and its occupant. This was purely a cave-man prompting, and\r\nbefore it could translate itself into action the opportunity was gone.\r\nWhen the motor-boat had disappeared, losing itself to sight and sound,\r\nthe breathless pursuer went back to his blankets, swearing gloomily at\r\nthe spiteful chance which had opened the door of misfortune by making\r\nhim a college classmate of one Watson Grider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV\r\n\r\n                         OF THE NAME OF BANDISH\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next morning Prime waited until after breakfast before telling\r\nLucetta about the visit of the intruder, the postponement basing itself\r\nupon a very natural disinclination to re-align himself, even\r\nconstructively, with such a brutal humorist as Watson Grider. Indeed,\r\nwhen he told the story, he omitted to mention the barbarian's name;\r\nwould never have mentioned it if Lucetta had not pushed him into a\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n\"You say you saw the man; was it a stranger, or some one you knew?\" she\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't be sure,\" Prime evaded. \"The fire wasn't burning very\r\nbrightly, and he had just blinded me with his flashlight.\"\r\n\r\nThe gray eyes were regarding him calmly.\r\n\r\n\"It is to be hoped, Cousin Donald, that you will never have to fib\r\nyourself out of a real difficulty. You prevaricate so clumsily, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't lying,\" he protested; \"really, you know, I couldn't be sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you thought you recognized him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did,\" he admitted doggedly. \"I didn't mean to tell you, but I\r\nfancy it doesn't make any great difference now. It was Grider, of\r\ncourse.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have just said that I wasn't sure. I didn't see his face. But I saw a\r\ngolf cap and a sweater, and Grider wears both upon any and all\r\noccasions; he has even been accused of sleeping in them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should he come here like that and then run away again?\"\r\n\r\n\"He wanted to find out how his execrable joke was getting along, of\r\ncourse! I had a mind to fire at him after he got into the boat, and I\r\nwish now that I had. You didn't hear any of the noise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a sound.\" They had taken the cooking utensils down to the river\r\nedge to wash them, and Lucetta scoured for a silent half minute on the\r\nskillet before she picked the one comforting grain of assurance out of\r\nthe midnight adventure. \"We ought to be obliged to this outrageous\r\nfriend of yours for one thing, anyway,\" she commented. \"He has told us\r\nthat there are no more rapids to be shot. If he could come up the river\r\nin a motor-boat, we can go down it safely in a canoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so,\" said Prime; \"I hadn't thought of that. I wonder if our\r\npatch is sticking all right. Suppose we go and see.\"\r\n\r\nThey went to look, and what they saw struck them both dumb. The clamped\r\npatch was still in place, but a glance at the upturned canoe bottom\r\nshowed them what the midnight marauder had done and explained for Prime\r\nthe cause of the ripping noise he had heard. For a distance fully\r\none-third of its length the thin sheathing of the canoe had been cut as\r\nif with the slashing blow of a sharp knife.\r\n\r\nPrime was the first to find speech, and what he said would have kindled\r\na fire under wet wood. Then he remembered and made gritting amends. \"I\r\nbeg your pardon; I couldn't help it, Lucetta. I'm not taken that way\r\nvery often, but I should have blown up like a rotten boiler if I\r\ncouldn't have relieved the pressure. Did you ever hear of such an\r\ninfernally idiotic scoundrel in all your life? I wish to gracious I'd\r\nhad the courage of my convictions and turned loose on him with the gun!\r\nHe deserves to be shot!\"\r\n\r\nLucetta was examining the damaged canoe bottom more closely. \"But why?\"\r\nshe protested. \"Why should he follow us up so vindictively, Donald?\r\nSurely it has passed all the limits of any kind of a joke by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of a joke?--yes; I should say so! I hate to think it of him, Lucetta--I\r\ndo for a fact. If I hadn't seen him I wouldn't believe it was Watson;\r\nbut seeing is believing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not always,\" was the reflective dissent. And then: \"This is the work of\r\na spiteful enemy, Donald; not that of any friend, however harebrained.\r\nIt is the work of some one who has a particular object in keeping us\r\nfrom getting back to civilization.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have been over all that ground until it is worn out,\" Prime broke in\r\nimpatiently. \"It is Grider; it can't be anybody else; and I wish I had\r\npotted him while I had the chance. But that is a back number now. The\r\nmischief is done and we must repair it if we can. Get your glue-pot\r\nready and I'll go and hunt for some more of the sticky stuff.\"\r\n\r\nLucetta was laughing silently.\r\n\r\n\"We are so humanly inconsistent--both of us!\" she commented. \"Yesterday\r\nwe were almost willing to be sorry because our woods idyll couldn't last\r\nforever; and now we are ready to draw and quarter Mr. Grider--or whoever\r\ndid this--because it makes the idyll last a few days longer.\"\r\n\r\nIt took them the better part of the day to patch the knife-gash, and,\r\nthough the other patch seemed to be holding satisfactorily, they were\r\ndoubtful of the results in the more serious hurt. It was impossible to\r\ndevise any clamp for the greater rent, but they did their best,\r\noverlaying the fresh patches with clean sheets of the bark and weighting\r\nthe whole down with flat stones carried laboriously from the river\r\nbrink.\r\n\r\nThat night Prime slept with one eye open and with both guns where he\r\ncould lay his hands upon them quickly. Somewhile past midnight he got up\r\nand built a small fire beyond the canoe as another measure of safety,\r\nlocking the stable carefully after the horse had been stolen. When he\r\nwent back to his blankets he found Lucetta up and sitting under the\r\nturned-up flap of the shelter-tent.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear anything?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \"No; I thought I'd light up a little more so that we\r\ncouldn't be stalked again as we were last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are losing too much sleep. Let me have one of the guns and I'll\r\nkeep watch for a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"What could you do with a gun?\" he demanded gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"I can at least make a noise and waken you if needful.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no sleep for either of them for a long time; but after a while\r\nPrime lost himself, and when he awoke it was daylight and Lucetta was\r\ncooking breakfast.\r\n\r\nOn this day they were fairly out of an occupation. With the stone\r\nweightings removed, the canoe patches seemed to be sticking bravely,\r\nbut they still required to be daubed with another coating of the pitch,\r\nwhich must dry thoroughly before they could venture upon a relaunching.\r\nThe small job done, they took turns sleeping through the forenoon, and\r\nafter the midday meal Prime went fishing, taking care, however, not to\r\ngo beyond calling distance from the glade.\r\n\r\nWhen night came they carried the precious canoe to the exact centre of\r\nthe clear space and built a circle of small fires all around it, at the\r\nimminent risk of burning it up or at least of melting the pitch from its\r\nseams. The afternoon had been cloudy and there were indications of a\r\nstorm. Prime made the fastenings of the shelter-tent secure and stowed\r\nthe provisions under the overturned birch-bark, leaving a space where he\r\ncould crawl under himself if the storm should break. For a long time\r\nafter supper they sat together beside the cooking-fire. The mosquitoes\r\nwere worse than usual, and Prime had provided some rotting wood for a\r\nsmudge, in the reek of which they wept in sympathetic companionship.\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of smoked meat,\" Prime grumbled, after they had exhausted all\r\nother topics, \"that jerked stuff under the canoe hasn't any the best of\r\nus.\" Then, with a teasing switch to their rapidly disintegrating\r\nclothes: \"How would you like to walk into your classroom in the girls'\r\nschool just as you are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just about as well as you'd like to walk down Fifth Avenue under the\r\nsame conditions,\" was the choking reply. \"My! but that smoke is\r\ndreadful!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is like the saw-off between any two evils: when you are enduring the\r\none you think you'd rather endure the other. Let us hope and pray that\r\nthis is the last night for us in this particular sheol, at least. I've\r\nheard and read a good bit about the insect pests of the northern woods,\r\nand I have always taken it with a grain of salt. That is another mistake\r\nI shall never make again.\"\r\n\r\n\"They were not bad on the St. Lawrence nor in Quebec,\" observed the\r\nother martyr.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Quebec started a new subject or, rather, revived an old\r\none, and they fell to talking of their short experience in the historic\r\ncity. One thing leading to another, Prime went more specifically into\r\nhis evening excursion with the athletic young fellow who had seemed so\r\nanxious to increase the dividends of the motion-picture houses and the\r\ncafes.\r\n\r\n\"He was a handsome fellow, and he didn't begin to have the face of a\r\nvillain,\" he commented. \"A good talker too. He had travelled--been\r\neverywhere. One of the pictures we saw was a 'Western,' and that brought\r\non more talk. I remember he told me a lot about his own experience in\r\nthe British Columbia mines. It was great stuff. He had been manager and\r\ngeneral factotum for some rich old money-bags--if he wasn't lying to me\r\nand making it all up out of whole cloth.\"\r\n\r\n\"He didn't do anything to make you suspect that he might have designs\r\nupon you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a thing in the world. He was as frank and open-hearted as a boy.\r\nThere wasn't anything peculiar about him except his habit of looking at\r\nhis watch every few minutes. I asked him once if I was keeping him from\r\nan appointment, and he laughed and said he wished that I were; wished\r\nthat he were well enough acquainted in the city to be able to make\r\nappointments.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he tell you his name?\" queried the weeping listener.\r\n\r\n\"He did, and ever since we woke up and found ourselves back yonder on\r\nthe lake shore I have been trying to recall it. It is gone completely.\r\n'Bender' is the nearest I can come to it, and that isn't it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you know it if you should hear it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I should. It was a queer name, and I remember thinking at the\r\ntime that I would jot it down and use it for the name of a character in\r\na story--simply because it was so delightfully odd.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" she broke in quickly; \"was this young man of yours fair, with\r\nblue eyes, and hair that reminded you a little of a hayfield?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the man!\"\r\n\r\n\"How would 'Bandish' do for the name?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"You've got it! That's what it was. How in the name of all that is\r\nwonderful did you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was merely putting one and one together to make two,\" was the quiet\r\nrejoinder. \"The young woman I was with that same night was Mrs. Bandish.\r\nShe was the one whose careless sleeve-pin scratched my arm and put me to\r\nsleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you knew them both?\" Prime demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Only slightly. They claimed to be teachers from some little town in\r\nIndiana. I don't know where they joined our party, but I think it was\r\nbefore we took the St. Lawrence River boat. Anyway, it was somewhere in\r\nCanada. They were easy to get acquainted with. At first I didn't like\r\nthe young woman any too well; there was something about her that gave me\r\nthe idea that she was--well, that she was somehow too sophisticated. But\r\nthat wore off. She was quick-witted and jolly, and both she and her\r\nhusband were the life of the party coming down the big river.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose Grider bribed them to join the party and thus get you in\r\ntow?\" Prime asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't suppose anything of the kind. You are forgetting that Mr.\r\nGrider didn't even know of my existence at that time--if he does now,\"\r\nshe added, after a moment's hesitation.\r\n\r\n\"Grider knew, and he knew that we were cousins,\" Prime insisted. \"That\r\nis a guess, but you will see that it will turn out to be the right one.\r\nBut even that doesn't explain why he should come up here in the woods\r\nand cut a hole in our canoe, confound him!\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't explain a good many things which are much more mysterious\r\nthan they were before,\" said Lucetta; and shortly after that she smoked\r\nher tent blue with a bit of smudge wood and disappeared for the night,\r\nleaving Prime to pull reflectively at a clumsy pipe which he had\r\ncontrived to whittle out of a bit of birch wood during the day of\r\nwaiting, to smoke and to hope that the threatening rain-storm would\r\nmaterialize and drown a few millions of the tormenting mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XV\r\n\r\n                             JEAN BA'TISTE\r\n\r\n\r\nON a morning which Prime, consulting his notched stick, named as the\r\ntwenty-fourth of July, they gave the canoe patches another daubing of\r\npitch for good luck, relaunched their argosy, loaded the dunnage, and\r\nbegan to learn the art of paddling anew--the relearning being made\r\nstrictly necessary by the new green-wood paddles.\r\n\r\nFrom a boisterous mill-race in its upper reaches, their river had now\r\nsubsided into a broad stream with a current so leisurely that they had\r\nto paddle continuously to make any headway. With this handicap their\r\nprogress was slow, and it was not until the afternoon of the second day\r\nthat they began to see signs to hint that they were approaching the\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\nThe signs were neither numerous nor indicative of any recent habitancy:\r\na few old clearings with their stumps weathered and rotting; here and\r\nthere a spot luxuriantly green to mark an area where slashings had been\r\nburned; in one place a decaying runway to show where the logs had been\r\nskidded into the river; all these proved that they were not pioneers;\r\nbut withal they saw no human being to dispute possession with them.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of this second day they camped on the right-hand bank a\r\nshort distance below one of the old clearings, kindling their night fire\r\na few yards from the river in a small grove of second-growth pines. The\r\nplace was not entirely to their liking; the river-bank was high, and\r\nthey could not draw the canoe out without partially unloading it. While\r\nLucetta was busying herself with the supper, Prime, as a precautionary\r\nmeasure, made a porter of himself to the extent of carrying a good part\r\nof the dunnage up to the fire, and after thus lightening the canoe he\r\nhauled it out of water as far as the steep bank would permit.\r\n\r\nWhile they were eating supper an unexpected guest turned up. Lucetta was\r\nthe first to hear the dip of a paddle in the stream, and a moment later\r\nthey both heard the grating of a boat bottom on the sand. Prime sprang\r\nup, rifle in hand, and went to meet the newcomer, prepared to do battle\r\nif needful. When he returned he was followed by a small man, dark,\r\nbearded, and with bead-like black eyes roving and shifty. He was dressed\r\nmore like an Indian than a white man; there were fringes on his\r\nmoccasins and also on the belted coat, which was much the worse for wear\r\nand hard usage.\r\n\r\n\"_Moi_, Jean Ba'tiste; I mek you de good evenin', _m'sieu' et madame_,\"\r\nhe said, introducing himself brusquely, and as he spoke the roving eyes\r\nwere taking in every detail of the bivouac camp. Then, with no more ado,\r\nhe squatted beside the fire and became their supper guest, saying\r\nsimply: \"You eat?--good; _moi_, I eat, too.\"\r\n\r\nSince there seemed to be no question of ceremony, Prime made the guest\r\nwelcome, heaping his tin plate and pouring tea for him in the spare cup.\r\nThe small man ate as if he were half starved, and was saving of speech\r\nduring the process, though the roving eyes seemed to be doing double\r\nduty. The meal devoured, he produced a black clay pipe with a broken\r\nstem and uttered a single word, \"Tabac'?\" and when the want was supplied\r\nhe crumbled himself a pipeful from the twist which Prime handed him.\r\n\r\nPrime filled his own home-made pipe, and at its lighting the guest began\r\na curt inquisition.\r\n\r\n\"W'ere you come from?\"\r\n\r\nPrime explained without going into any of the kidnapping details.\r\n\r\n\"You campin' out for fon, mebbe, yes?\" was the next query.\r\n\r\n\"A little that way,\" said Prime.\r\n\r\n\"You shoot wiz ze gon? W'ere all dat game w'at you get?\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't the game season,\" Prime parried. \"We haven't tried to shoot\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you 'ave ze gon. Lemme see 'um,\" holding out a hand for the rifle.\r\n\r\nPrime passed over the gun nearest at hand and drew the other one up\r\nwithin reach. The inquisitive supper guest looked the weapon over\r\ncarefully and seemed to be trying to read something in the scratches on\r\nthe stock.\r\n\r\n\"_Vraiment!_ she's one good gon,\" he commented, passing it back. \"W'ere\r\nyou get 'um?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_Vraiment!_ she's one good gon,\" he commented.... \"W'ere\r\nyou get 'um?\"]\r\n\r\nPrime did not answer the question. He thought it was high time to ask a\r\nfew of his own.\r\n\r\n\"What river is this?\" he wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"You make canoe on him and you not know dat? She is Mishamen; comes\r\nbimeby to Riviere du Lievres.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far?\"\r\n\r\n\"One, two, t'ree day; mebbe more.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that we will reach a town in two or three days?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mebbe so, if you don' get los'.\"\r\n\r\nPrime exchanged a quick glance with his fellow castaway. Lucetta\r\nsignalled \"Yes,\" and he acted accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"What will you charge to show us the way to the nearest town?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe small man did not seem especially eager for money. He was examining\r\nthe gun again. \"_Moi_, I can't go--too bizzee. W'ere you got dis gon?\"\r\n\r\n\"It came with our outfit,\" said Prime shortly. \"We got it when we got\r\nthe canoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And w'ere you got dat canoe?\"\r\n\r\nThe inquisition was growing rather embarrassing, but Prime answered as\r\nbest he could.\r\n\r\n\"We got the outfit up at the big lake where we started from. We have\r\ncome all the way down the river.\"\r\n\r\nWith this the restless-eyed querist appeared to be satisfied. At all\r\nevents he did not press the questioning any further, and was content to\r\ntake another pipe-filling from Prime's tobacco twist and to tell a\r\nlittle more about himself. He was \"one ver' great trapper,\" in his own\r\nphrase, and was also a \"timber looker\" for a lumber company. Lucetta had\r\nwithdrawn to the privacy of her tent, and Prime could not divest himself\r\nof the idea that the small man whose tongue had been so suddenly\r\nloosened was merely sparring for time, time in which to accomplish some\r\nend of his own. In due course the battery was unmasked.\r\n\r\n\"You say you begin _voyageur_ on ze big lake. W'ere you leave Jules\r\nBeaujeau an' Pierre Cambon, eh, w'at?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know them,\" said Prime, telling the simple truth.\r\n\r\n\"Dis Pierre Cambon's gon,\" said the little man, suddenly tapping the\r\nweapon he had been inspecting. \"She 'ave hees name on ze stock. An' ze\r\nbirch-bark down yonder; she's belong' to Jules Beaujeau. You buy 'um?\"\r\n\r\nPrime scarcely knew what to say; whether to tell the truth, which would\r\nnot be believed, or to make up a lie, which might be believed. As a\r\ncompromise he chose a middle course, which is always the most dangerous.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know these two you speak of, by name; but the two men who owned\r\nthe canoe and the guns are both dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe supper guest sprang up as if a bomb had been exploded under him and\r\nquickly put a safe distance between himself and the camp-fire.\r\n\r\n\"You--you kill 'um?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"No; come back here and sit down. They had a fight and killed each\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nThe man returned hesitantly and squatted beside the fire to press\r\nanother live coal into the bowl of his pipe. Prime switched the talk\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better change your mind about the offer I made you and pilot us\r\nto the nearest town. We will pay you well for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You got money?\" was the short question.\r\n\r\n\"Plenty of it.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the \"ver' great trapper\" assumed to take the proposal under\r\nconsideration, smoking other pipes, chaffering and bargaining and\r\nprolonging his stay deep into the night. When he finally took his leave,\r\nsaying that he must go on to his camp, which was a few miles up one of\r\nthe smaller tributaries of the main stream, it was with a half promise\r\nto come back in the morning for the piloting.\r\n\r\nPrime took counsel of prudence and did not settle himself for the night\r\nimmediately after the sharp-eyed one had gone. Laying his pipe aside, he\r\ncrept cautiously out to the river-bank and assured himself that his late\r\nvisitor was doing what he had said he would do, namely, heading off up\r\nthe river with clean, quick strokes of the paddle, which soon sent his\r\nlight craft out of sight. Prime climbed down the bank, satisfied\r\nhimself that the patched canoe and its partial lading had not been\r\ndisturbed, and then went back to the fire to roll himself in his\r\nblankets. The incident, with its inquisitorial pryings, had been rather\r\ndisturbing, in a way, but it was apparently an incident closed.\r\n\r\nTurning in so late after a laborious day on the river, Prime overslept\r\nthe next morning, and when he awoke he found Lucetta already up and\r\nfrying the bacon.\r\n\r\n\"Your man didn't stay all night?\" she questioned, after Prime had\r\nscolded her for not making him get up and do his part.\r\n\r\n\"No; he sat here until between ten and eleven o'clock and gave me two or\r\nthree bad minutes. He recognized our canoe and one of the guns, told me\r\nthe names of the dead men, and wanted to know what had become of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't tell him?\" she gasped.\r\n\r\n\"In the cold light of the morning after, I am afraid I told him too much\r\nor too little. I told him the men who owned the canoe and its outfit\r\nwere dead; that they'd had a fight and killed each other. Candidly, I\r\ndon't think he believed it. It scared him until I thought he was going\r\nto have a fit. I had to jolly him up a bit before he would come back to\r\nthe fire and talk some more.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does he believe?\" she inquired anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"He wouldn't tell me, and I couldn't decide by merely looking at him. I\r\nhope I've hired him to pilot us to the nearest town. When he went away\r\nhe intimated that he might be back this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we wait for him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; if he isn't here by the time we are ready to start, we'll go on and\r\ntake our chance of 'gettin' los',' as he put it. I think that was a\r\nbluff, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nThey breakfasted leisurely, and Prime even took time to smoke a pipe\r\nbefore beginning to break camp. But his first trip to the river-bank\r\nwith a load of the dunnage brought him back on a run.\r\n\r\n\"Our canoe's gone!\" he announced breathlessly. \"That little wretch came\r\nback and stole it while we were asleep!\"\r\n\r\nLucetta sat down and propped her chin in her hands.\r\n\r\n\"This is the beginning of the end, Donald,\" she said quite calmly and\r\nwith a touch of resignation in her voice. \"Do you know why he took the\r\ncanoe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he's an infernal thief!\" Prime raged hotly.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she contradicted. \"It is because he thinks we have murdered the\r\ntwo owners of the canoe, and he wanted to make sure that we wouldn't run\r\naway while he went after help to arrest us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XVI\r\n\r\n                              _MARCHONS!_\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIME leaned against a tree and took a full minute for a grasping of the\r\nnew situation.\r\n\r\n\"I more than half believe you are right,\" he admitted at length. Then,\r\nwith a crabbed laugh: \"If there is any bigger dunce on earth than I am I\r\nshould like to meet him--just as a matter of curiosity. I'll never brag\r\non my imagination after this. I could see plainly enough that the fellow\r\nwas fairly eaten up with suspicion, and it would have been so easy to\r\nhave invented a plausible lie to satisfy him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be sorry for that,\" the young woman put in quickly. \"If they\r\narrest us we shall have to tell the truth.\"\r\n\r\nPrime was frowning thoughtfully. \"That is where the shoe pinches. Do you\r\nrealize that the story we have to tell is one that no sane magistrate or\r\njury could ever believe, Lucetta? These two men, Beaujeau and Cambon,\r\nmust have started from some known somewhere, alive and well. They\r\ndisappear, and after a while we turn up in possession of their\r\nbelongings and try to account for ourselves by telling a fantastic\r\nfairy-tale. It's simply hopeless!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are killing the only suggestion I had in mind,\" was the dispirited\r\nrejoinder. \"I was going to say that we might wait here until they came\r\nfor us, but that won't do at all. We must hurry and disappear before\r\nthey come back and find us!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it will be best,\" Prime decided promptly. \"If we had a\r\nreasonable story to tell it would be different. But we haven't, and the\r\nchances are that we should get into all sorts of trouble trying to\r\nexplain for other people a thing that we can't explain for ourselves. It\r\nis up to us to hit the trail. Are you fit for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't I be?\" she asked, but there was no longer the old-time\r\nbuoyancy in her tone.\r\n\r\n\"I have had a notion the last day or two that you were not feeling quite\r\nup to the mark,\" Prime explained soberly. \"It is something about your\r\neyes; they look heavy, as if you hadn't had sleep enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can do my part of anything that we have to do,\" she returned, rising;\r\nand together they made a judicious division of the dunnage, deciding\r\nwhat they could take and what they must leave behind.\r\n\r\nThe uncertainties made the decision hard to arrive at. If the tramp\r\nshould last no more than three or four days they could carry the\r\nnecessary food without much difficulty. But they could scarcely afford\r\nto give up the blankets and the shelter-tent, and Prime insisted that\r\nthey must take at least one of the guns and the axe. These extras, with\r\nthe provisions and the cooking-utensils, made one light load and one\r\nrather heavy one, and under this considerable handicap the day's march\r\nwas begun.\r\n\r\nThe slow progress was difficult from the very outset. Since the river\r\nwas their only guide, they did not dare to leave it to seek an easier\r\npath. By noon Prime saw that his companion was keeping up by sheer force\r\nof will, and he tried to get her to consent to a halt for the\r\nafternoon. But she would not give up.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she insisted. \"We must go on. I am tired; I'll admit it; but I\r\nshould be something worse than tired if we should have to stop and be\r\novertaken.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the day's march they seemed to have left behind\r\nall of the former hopeful signs, and were once more making their way\r\nthrough a primeval forest, untouched, so far as they could see, by the\r\nwoodsman's axe. Their night camp was made among the solemn spruces by\r\nthe side of a little brook winding its way to the nearby river. Prime\r\nmade a couch of the spruce-tips, the folded tent cloth, and the\r\nblankets, and persuaded Lucetta to lie down while he prepared the\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was ready the substitute cook was the only one who could\r\neat. Lucetta said she didn't care for anything but a cup of tea, and\r\nwhen Prime took it to her he saw that the slate-gray eyes were\r\nunnaturally bright and her face was flushed. Whereat a great fear seized\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n\"You are sick!\" he exclaimed, grappling helplessly with the unnerving\r\nfear. \"Why didn't you tell me before? I thought--I hoped you were just\r\ntired out with the long tramp.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be better in the morning,\" she answered bravely. \"It has been\r\ncoming on for a day or two, I think. Why did we camp here in this close\r\nplace, where it is so hot?\"\r\n\r\nPrime gripped his fleeting courage and held it hard. It was not hot\r\nunder the spruces; on the contrary, the evening was almost chilly.\r\nBestirring himself quickly to do what little he was able to do, he moved\r\nthe sick one gently and set up the tent to shelter her, dipped the\r\nremaining bit of the soft deerskin into the brook and made a cold\r\ncompress for the aching head, and then sat down with a birch-bark fan to\r\nkeep the mosquitoes away.\r\n\r\nAs the night wore on he realized more and more his utter helplessness.\r\nHe had had no experience with sickness or with the care of the sick, and\r\nif the remedies had been at hand he would not have known how to use\r\nthem. Time and again, after Lucetta had fallen into a troubled sleep, he\r\nmade his way to the riverbank to stare anxiously in the darkness up and\r\ndown the stream in the faint hope that help might appear. But for all\r\nhis longings the silent river gave back neither sight nor sound.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Lucetta's fever had abated, but it had left her weak and\r\nexhausted; much too weak to continue the march, though she was willing\r\nand anxious to make the trial. Prime vetoed that at once and tried his\r\nbest to concoct something out of their diminished store of provisions\r\nthat would prove appetizing to the invalid. She ate a little of the\r\nbroth prepared from the smoked deer meat merely to please him, and drank\r\nthirstily of the tea; but still Prime was not encouraged.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon Lucetta's temperature rose again, and, harassed and\r\nanxious as he was, Prime was thankful that the fever did not make her\r\ndelirious. That, he told himself, would be the final straw. So far from\r\nwandering, she was able to talk to him; to talk and to thank him\r\ngratefully for his earnest but skilless attempts to make her more\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\"It is simply maddening to think that there isn't anything really\r\nhelpful that I can do,\" he protested, at one of these pathetic little\r\noutbreaks of gratitude. \"What do they do for people who have fevers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quinine,\" she said, with a twitching of the lips which was meant to be\r\na smile. \"Why don't you give me a good big dose of quinine, Donald?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, why don't I?\" he lamented. \"Why do I have to sit here like a bump\r\non a log and do nothing!\"\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't worry,\" she interposed gently. \"You are not responsible for\r\nme and my aches and pains. You must try to remember that only a little\r\nmore than three weeks ago we were total strangers to each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three weeks ago and now are two vastly different things, Lucetta. You\r\nhave proved yourself to be the bravest, pluckiest little comrade that a\r\nman ever had! And I--I, whose life you have saved, can do nothing for\r\nyou in your time of need. It's heartbreaking!\"\r\n\r\nThe night, which came on all too slowly for the man who could do\r\nnothing, was even less hopeful than the previous one had been. Though he\r\nhad no means of measuring it, Prime was sure that the fever rose higher.\r\nFor himself he caught only cat-naps now and then during the long hours,\r\nand between two of these he went to the river-bank and built a\r\nsignal-fire on the remote chance of summoning help in that way.\r\n\r\nBetween two and three o'clock in the morning the fever began to subside\r\nagain, and the poor patient awoke. She was perfectly reasonable but\r\ngreatly depressed, not so much over her own condition as on Prime's\r\naccount. Again she sought to make him take the purely extraneous view,\r\nand when that failed she talked quite calmly about the possibilities.\r\n\r\n\"I have had so little sickness that I hardly know whether this is really\r\nserious or not,\" she said. \"But if I shouldn't--if anything should\r\nhappen to me, I hope you won't--you won't have to bury me in the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"For Heaven's sake, don't talk that way!\" he burst out. \"You're not\r\ngoing to die! You _mustn't_ die!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I don't want to,\" she returned. \"Especially just now, when I\r\nwas beginning to learn how to live. May I have a drink of water?\"\r\n\r\nHe went to the brook and got it for her, raging inwardly at the thought\r\nthat he could not even offer her a drink out of a vessel that wouldn't\r\ntaste tinny. When her thirst was quenched she went on half musingly.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad there isn't any one to be so very sorry, Donald. I know it\r\nmust be fine to have a family and to be surrounded by all kinds of love\r\nand affection; but those things carry terrible penalties. Did you ever\r\nthink of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hadn't,\" he confessed. \"I've been a sort of lonesome one, myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"The penalties work both ways,\" she went on. \"It breaks your heart to\r\nhave to leave the loved ones, and it breaks theirs to have you go. I\r\nsuppose the girls in the school will be sorry; they all seem to like me\r\npretty well, even if I am a 'cross old maid,' as one of them once called\r\nme to my face.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't imagine you cross; and as to your being old, why you're nothing\r\nbut a kid, Lucetta--just a poor little sick kiddy. And, goodness knows,\r\nyou've had enough to knock you out and to make you think all sorts of\r\ngrubby thoughts. You mustn't; you are going to get well again, and we'll\r\nmarch along together the same as ever. Or perhaps the sheriff will find\r\nus, after all. I've kindled a big fire down on the river-bank so that he\r\nwon't have any excuse for overlooking us. Day before yesterday I would\r\nhave tramped twenty miles to dodge him, but to-night I'd welcome him\r\nwith open arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were foolish to try to run away,\" she said. \"And that was my fault,\r\ntoo. The--the next time you are kidnapped, you must be careful not to\r\nlet yourself be tied to a petticoat, Cousin Donald. They are always in\r\nthe way.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I hadn't been tied to a petticoat that could swim, I shouldn't be\r\nhere to-night fanning the mosquitoes away from you,\" he retorted, with a\r\nlaugh that was meant to be cheering. And then he reverted to his one\r\noverwhelming and blankly insoluble problem: \"If I only knew what to do\r\nfor you!\"\r\n\r\n\"When I was a little girl we lived in the country, and my mother\r\ndoctored the entire neighborhood with roots and herbs. It is a pity I\r\nhaven't inherited a little of her skill, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are lashings of pitiful things in this world, Lucetta, and we are\r\ngetting acquainted with a few of them right now. But I mustn't let you\r\ntalk too much. Try to go to sleep, if you can, and get a little rest\r\nbefore the fever comes on again.\"\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes obediently, and after a time he knew by her regular\r\nbreathing that she was asleep. For a patient hour he kept the birch-bark\r\nfan in motion and with the first streakings of dawn got up stiffly to\r\nmake his way to the river-bank, dragging with him a half-rotted log to\r\nturn the pillar-of-fire signal into a pillar of smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XVII\r\n\r\n                            ROOTS AND HERBS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE dawning of the second day in the camp under the great spruces found\r\nPrime still struggling desperately with the problem of what to do.\r\nLucetta's condition seemed to be rather worse than better. There was the\r\nusual morning abatement of the fever, but she was evidently growing\r\nweaker. Prime's too vivid imagination pictured an impending catastrophe,\r\nand the canoe thief, no less than Watson Grider, came in for wordless\r\nand despairing maledictions. If the canoe had not been stolen they might\r\nby now be within reach of help.\r\n\r\nIt was when matters were at this most distressing pass that the\r\nwriting-man's invention, pricked alive by what Lucetta had said\r\nconcerning her mother's skill with simples, opened a temerarious door of\r\nhope. Making his charge as comfortable as he could, and leaving a cup of\r\nwater where she could reach it, he told her he was going for a walk.\r\n\r\nTaking the brook for a pathfinder, he traced its course until it led him\r\ninto a region of opener spaces where there was a better chance for\r\nground growth. In the first weed patch he came to he began to pluck and\r\ntaste. Unhappily, his knowledge of botany was perilously near a minus\r\nquantity; there were few of the weeds that he knew even by name. At the\r\nimminent risk of poisoning himself, he went on, chewing a leaf here and\r\nthere, not knowing in the least what he was looking for, but having an\r\ninchoate idea that a febrifuge ought to be something bitter.\r\n\r\nThe tasting process gave him a variety of new experiences. The leaves of\r\none weed burned his mouth like fire, and he had to stop and plunge his\r\nface into the brook to extinguish the conflagration. Those of another\r\nmade him deathly sick. Finally he came to a tall plant with bluish-white\r\nflowers which looked familiar, in a way, though he could not recall its\r\nname. A chewed leaf convinced him at once that he need seek no farther.\r\nThere was the bitterness of hopeless sorrow in its horrible acridity; it\r\nclung to him tenaciously while he was gathering an armful of the plant,\r\nand went with him on his return to the camp--this, in spite of the fact\r\nthat he stopped frequently to wash his mouth with brook water.\r\n\r\n\"What have you there?\" was Lucetta's query when he came in with his\r\nburden.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, but I am hoping you can tell me,\" he said, giving her a\r\nspray of the weed to look at. \"Have you ever seen it before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hundreds of times,\" she returned. \"It is a common weed in Ohio. But I\r\nhaven't the slightest idea what it is.\"\r\n\r\nPrime groaned. \"More of the town-bred education,\" he deprecated. \"But\r\nnever mind; they can't call us nature-fakirs, whatever other foolish\r\nname we may be earning for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with it?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Wait and you'll see.\"\r\n\r\nWith the bread-mixing tin for a stew-pan Prime made a rich decoction of\r\nthe leaves. When the mess began to simmer and steam the poor patient\r\nraised herself on one elbow to look at it.\r\n\r\n\"You are not going to make me drink all that, are you, Donald?\" she\r\nprotested weakly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; not all of it. Wait until it's properly cooked and I'll show\r\nyou what I am going to do with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe cooking took some time, but the culinary effort offered a mild\r\ndiversion and was at least a change from the deadly routine of doing\r\nnothing. The steam rising from the stewing leaves gave off a peculiarly\r\nafflicting odor, and Lucetta sniffed it apprehensively.\r\n\r\n\"It smells very horrible,\" she ventured. \"Is it going to taste as bad as\r\nit smells?\"\r\n\r\n\"That, my dear girl, is on the knees of the gods,\" he returned\r\noracularly.\r\n\r\n\"How did you find it?\" she wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"By the simple process of cut and try. And I can assure you that,\r\nhowever bad it may smell or taste, it hasn't anything on some of the\r\nleaves I've been chewing this morning.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the dose was sufficiently cooked Prime fished the leaves out of the\r\nliquor with a forked twig, and carried the stew-pan to the brook to\r\ntake the scalding edge off of the ill-smelling decoction.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ready to be poisoned?\" he asked when he came back.\r\n\r\n\"You're--you're sure it _isn't_ poison, aren't you?\" she quavered.\r\n\r\n\"No, but I am going to be,\" and with that he shut his eyes, held his\r\nbreath, and took a long drink from the stew-pan of fate, disregarding\r\neasily, in the frightful bitterness of the draft, Lucetta's little cry\r\nof dismay.\r\n\r\n\"Merely trying it on the dog,\" he gasped when he put the pan down and\r\nturned away so that she should not see the face contortions--grimaces\r\nforthshowing the resentment of an outraged palate. Then he went to sit\r\non his blanket-roll to await results. \"If--if it doesn't kill me, then\r\nyou can try it; but--but we'll wait a few minutes and see what it's\r\ngoing to do to me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the results proved to be merely embittering and not immediately\r\ndeadly, he became a nurse again.\r\n\r\n\"I have left it as hot as you can drink it,\" he said, offering the\r\nbasin. \"It seems as if it ought to do more good that way. Take a good\r\nlong swig, if you can stand it.\"\r\n\r\nLucetta put her lips to the mixture and made a face of disgust.\r\n\r\n\"Ou-e-e-e!--_boneset!_\" she shuddered. \"I'd know it if I should meet it\r\nin another world--it takes me right back to my childhood and mother's\r\nroots and herbs! I can't, Donald; I simply _can't_ drink all of that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Drink as much as you can. It's good for little sick people,\" he urged,\r\ntrying to twist the wryness of his own aftermath into a smile. \"If the\r\nhorrible taste counts for anything, it ought to make you well in five\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\nLucetta did her duty bravely, and when the worst was over Prime tucked\r\nher up in the blankets, adding his own for good measure. Then he made up\r\na roasting fire, having some vague notion brought over from his boyhood\r\nthat fever patients ought to sweat. Past this, he made a sad cake of\r\npan-bread for his own midday meal, and when it was eaten he found that\r\nLucetta had fallen asleep, and was further encouraged when he saw that\r\nfine little beads of perspiration had broken out on her forehead.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon before she awoke and called him.\r\n\r\n\"Are you feeling any better?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Much better; only I'm so warm I feel as if I should melt and run away.\r\nCan't you take at least one of the blankets off?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. You like to cook things, and I am giving you some of your own\r\nmedicine. This is Domestic Science as applied to the human organization.\r\nJust imagine you are a missionary on one of the South Sea Islands, and\r\nthat you are going to be served up presently _a la_ Fiji. Shall I try to\r\nfix you up something to eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. But I feel as if I could drink the brook dry.\"\r\n\r\n\"No cold water,\" he decided authoritatively. \"The doctor forbids it. But\r\nyou may have another drink of hot boneset tea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please, not again!\" she pleaded; and at that he made her a cup of\r\nthe other kind of tea, which she drank gratefully.\r\n\r\n\"Taste good?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"It tastes like the boneset--everything is going to taste like boneset\r\nfor the next six weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't I know?\" he chuckled. \"Hasn't it already spoiled my dinner for\r\nme? I could taste it in everything.\" Then he told her about his\r\nexperiment in pan-bread, adding: \"I have saved a piece of it so that if\r\nyou wish to commit suicide after you get well, the means will be at\r\nhand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I am going to get well, Donald?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure you are! You'll have to do it in self-defense. Just think of the\r\noceans of bitterness you'll have to swallow if you don't. What is\r\npuzzling me now is to know what I am going to feed you. Do you suppose\r\nyou could tell me how to make some pap or gruel, or something of that\r\nsort?\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled at this, as he hoped she would, and said there was no need of\r\ncrossing that bridge until they should come to it. Shortly after this\r\nshe fell asleep again, and by nightfall Prime was overjoyed to find that\r\nher breathing was more natural, and that the fever was not rising. With\r\nthe coming of the darkness a fine breeze blew up from the river, and he\r\nwas overjoyed again when it proved strong enough to drive the tormenting\r\nmosquitoes back into the forest.\r\n\r\nThat night he was able to make up some of the lost sleep of the two\r\npreceding nights, and when daybreak came another burden was lifted.\r\nLucetta had slept all night, and she declared she was feeling much\r\nbetter; that the fever seemed to be entirely gone. This brought the\r\nquestion of nourishment to the fore again, and Prime attacked it\r\nbravely, opening their last tin of peas and making a broth of the liquor\r\nthickened with a little of the reground flour. Lucetta ate it to oblige\r\nhim, though it was as flat and tasteless as any unsalted mixture must\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\"Are you always as good as this to every strange woman you meet, Cousin\r\nDonald?\" she said, meaning to make the query some expression of her own\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\n\"Always,\" he returned promptly. \"I can't help it, you know; I'm built\r\nthat way. But you are no strange woman, Lucetta. If I can't do more for\r\nyou, I couldn't very well do less. We are partners, and thus far we\r\nhave shared things as they have come along--the good and the bad. What\r\nis troubling me most now is the same thing that was troubling me last\r\nnight: I don't know what I am going to feed you. You need a meat broth\r\nof some kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not any more of the smoked venison, please!\" she begged.\r\n\r\n\"No, it ought to be fresh meat of some sort. By and by, if the fever\r\ndoesn't come back, I'll take the gun and see if I can't get a rabbit. I\r\nsaw three yesterday morning while I was out chewing leaves. You won't be\r\nafraid to be left alone for a little while, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"After what we have been through, I think I shall never be afraid of\r\nanything again,\" she averred soberly. \"And to think that I was once\r\nafraid of a mouse!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is nothing,\" he laughed; \"you probably will be afraid of a mouse\r\nagain when you get back to an environment in which the mouse is properly\r\nan object of terror. I shan't think any the less of you if that does\r\nhappen.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled up at him.\r\n\r\n\"Men always talk so eloquently about the womanly woman: just what do\r\nthey mean by that, Donald? Is it the mouse-coward?\"\r\n\r\n\"It differs pretty widely with the man, I fancy,\" he returned. \"I know\r\nmy own ideal.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is the imaginary girl whose picture you are going to show me when\r\nwe get out?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed happily. \"You mustn't make me talk about that girl now,\r\nLucetta. Some day I'll tell you all about her. Perhaps it is only fair\r\nto say that she is not so terribly imaginary as she might be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not--if you have her picture,\" was the quiet reply; and a\r\nlittle while after that she told him she was sleepy again, and that he\r\nmight take the gun and go after a rabbit if that was what he wished to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nShe did go to sleep, but Prime did not go hunting until after the midday\r\nmeal; and thus it happened that when Lucetta awoke, along in the\r\nafternoon, she found herself alone. For an hour or two she was content\r\nto lie quietly, waiting for Prime to return, but when the afternoon\r\ndrew to a close and he still failed to put in an appearance she got up,\r\nrather totteringly, and replenished the camp-fire.\r\n\r\nAnother hour passed and she began to grow anxious. The spruce grove was\r\nplunged in shadows, but the sun had not yet set for the upper regions of\r\nthe air. By the time it was fully dark she knew that Prime was lost, and\r\nin this new terror she was able to forget, in some measure at least, the\r\neffects of her late illness. Bestirring herself once more, she put more\r\nwood on the fire, hoping that it might blaze high enough to serve as a\r\nsignal for the wanderer.\r\n\r\nIt was all she could do, and having done it she sat down to wait, her\r\nanxiety growing sharper as the evening wore on and there was neither\r\nsight nor sound to foreshadow the lost one's return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XVIII\r\n\r\n                           HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf she had not known it before, Lucetta was to learn now that sickness\r\nof any sort is but a poor preparation for a battle of anxiety and\r\nendurance. On the one other occasion when she had been thrown upon her\r\nown resources Prime had been at least visibly present, and his\r\nhelplessness had given her strength to fight off the terrors. But now\r\nshe was alone and the terrors pressed thickly.\r\n\r\nWhat if something had happened to the rabbit-hunter? She knew his utter\r\nlack of gun dexterity, and her terrified imagination conjured up\r\nharrowing pictures of the missing one lying wounded and helpless in some\r\ndistant forest solitude, a victim of his unselfish effort to provide not\r\nfor his own needs but for hers. The thought was a keen torture, but she\r\ncould not banish it, and as the hours lengthened it threatened to drive\r\nher mad. There was nothing she could do save to keep the fire burning\r\nbrightly, and this she did, breaking the monotony of the unnerving\r\nsuspense from time to time by collecting dry wood to heap upon the\r\nblaze.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly midnight before the agony came to a sudden end. She was\r\nlying on the blanket pallet, with her face hidden in the crook of an\r\nelbow when she looked up and saw Prime standing beside her. It was not\r\nin human nature to undergo the revulsion from the depths of despair\r\ncalmly.\r\n\r\n\"Donald!\" she shrieked faintly, and forgetting her weakness, she sprang\r\nup and flung herself into his arms, sobbing in an ecstasy of relief.\r\n\r\nHe took it in good brotherly fashion, and if the fraternal attitude was\r\nnot strictly sincere, it was made to appear so.\r\n\r\n\"There, there, little woman,\" he comforted, \"you mustn't turn loose that\r\nway--you'll make yourself sick again. It's all over now, and I got your\r\nrabbit. See, here it is\"--drawing it from his pocket and dangling it\r\nbefore her as if it were a new toy and she a child to be hastily\r\ndiverted.\r\n\r\nThe diversion was not needed; she was freeing herself from the clasp of\r\nthe remaining reassuring arm, and her cheeks were aflame.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know I could be so silly! Please don't hold it against me,\r\nDonald,\" she begged. \"If you only knew what I have been through since it\r\ngrew dark! You'll forgive me and--and not remember it after we--after\r\nwe----\"\r\n\r\nHis weariness fell from him like a castoff garment. \"Not if you don't\r\nwant me to, Lucetta. But it was rather--er--pleasant, you know--to find\r\nthat some one really cared enough about what had become of me to--to\r\nsort of forget herself for a moment.\"\r\n\r\nThe firelight was strong, and if he saw the adoring look that flashed\r\ninto the gray eyes he was magnanimous enough, or modest enough, to pass\r\nit over to the sudden transition from despair to relief.\r\n\r\n\"It must have been something fierce for you,\" he went on; \"but I did the\r\nbest I could after I had been idiotic enough to get lost. Of course,\r\nsince I had the gun with me, it was hours before I got sight of a\r\nrabbit; and even then I had to shoot at half a dozen of them before I\r\ncould manage to hit one. By that time it was getting on toward sunset,\r\nand I had lost the brook which I had taken for a guide.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew you would,\" she broke in. \"But that wasn't the worst of it. I\r\nkept imagining that you had shot yourself accidentally, and every time I\r\nclosed my eyes I could see you lying wounded and helpless!\"\r\n\r\n\"You poor little worrier!\" he pitied; \"I knew you would be scared stiff\r\nif I didn't get back by dark, and in my hurry I bore too far to the\r\nleft; a great deal too far, as it turned out, for when I reached the\r\nriver I recognized the place. It was just this side of the grove where\r\nwe were camping when the canoe was stolen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horrors!\" she gasped faintly. \"And you have walked all that distance?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he grinned; \"I ran a good part of it. When I came in a few minutes\r\nago I was dead from the waist down; but I am all right now. You sit down\r\nand drink broth while I skin this rabbit. It's a juicy one--as fat as\r\nbutter.\"\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes later the rabbit was stewing in the larger skillet, and\r\nPrime found time to ask Lucetta how she was feeling.\r\n\r\n\"Just plain hungry,\" she returned. \"The fever hasn't come back any more,\r\nand if I ever have a medicine-chest of my own there will be boneset in\r\nit; great, big, smelly packages of it. Aren't you going to let me make a\r\nbit of bread to eat with that delicious gravy broth?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it won't tire you too much,\" he consented, and at that he sat back\r\nand watched her while she mixed the bread, a housewifely little figure\r\nkneeling before the fire and patting the dough into a cake with hands\r\nthat not all the rough work of the adventure weeks had made misshapen.\r\n\r\nSomewhat beyond this they made their post-midnight meal, and were once\r\nmore light-hearted and care-free. In the aftermath of it, when Prime had\r\nlighted his homemade pipe, they were even buoyant enough to plan for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\"We'll go on again to-morrow, shan't we?\" the young woman assumed. \"We\r\ncan't be so very far from the towns now, with the river grown so\r\nlarge.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fancy we are nearer than we thought we were,\" Prime replied. \"Over to\r\nthe west, where I went this afternoon, there is another and still larger\r\nriver. On its banks the timber has all been cut off and there is nothing\r\nbut second and third growth. It is a safe bet that the two rivers come\r\ntogether a little below here, and if we are not stopped by our inability\r\nto cross the bigger river----\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not going to be stopped,\" she prophesied hopefully. \"I have a\r\nfeeling that our troubles, or the worst of them, are all over.\"\r\n\r\nPrime smiled. \"The joyous reaction is still with you, but that is all\r\nright and just as it should be. We'll keep on going until we come to a\r\ntown or a railroad, and then----\"\r\n\r\nShe was sufficiently light-hearted to laugh with him when he glanced\r\ndown at his torn and travel-worn clothes.\r\n\r\n\"And then we shall be arrested for tramps,\" she finished for him. \"There\r\nis one consolation--neither of us will look any worse than the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"When we find a town we shall find clothes,\" he asserted. \"Luckily we\r\nhave English money to buy with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you--would you spend that money?\" she asked, half fearfully.\r\n\r\n\"Why not? I'd hock the dead men themselves if we had them and there\r\nwasn't any other way to raise the wind. But I have some good,\r\nold-fashioned American money, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall have to borrow of you when we get to where we can buy things,\"\r\nshe said, with a sudden access of shyness that was new to him. \"I had a\r\npurse with a little money in it that night at Quebec, but it\r\ndisappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is mine is yours, Lucetta; surely you don't have to be told that,\r\nat this stage of the game.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said softly. \"That goes with everything else you have\r\ndone for me.\" Then, after a pause: \"Will you tell the other girl about\r\nthis--about this adventure of ours, Donald?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think I ought to tell her? Isn't it her right to know?\"\r\n\r\nShe took time to consider.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure; women are singular about some things; they don't always\r\nunderstand. Perhaps they don't care to understand--too much. Then there\r\nis always the difficulty of explaining things just as they were. I could\r\ntell better if I knew the girl. Is she young?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, y-yes--some years younger than I am. But she is all kinds of\r\nsensible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she in New York?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered soberly. \"She is not in New York.\"\r\n\r\nShe took it as a hint that she was not to ask any more questions about\r\nthe girl and changed the subject abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Shall you go and look for Mr. Grider after we find a railroad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not immediately. I shall first see you safe at home in your\r\ngirls'-school town in Ohio,\" he assured her firmly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that won't be necessary,\" she protested. \"I have travelled alone\r\nmany times. And I have my return ticket; or I shall have it when I get\r\nback to Quebec.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, I am going home with you,\" Prime insisted stubbornly.\r\n\"It is up to me to see you out of this, and I shall make a job of it\r\nwhile I am about it. When it is done I shall come back to Canada to find\r\nout who shanghaied us and what for. And when I find the people who did\r\nit they are going to pay for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if they include Mr. Grider?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, by Jove! Even if the man higher up happens to be Watson Grider. I\r\ndon't mind the kidnapping so much for myself, but the man doesn't live,\r\nLucetta, who can make you go through what you have gone through in the\r\npast month and get away with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't ask you to fight for me, Donald,\" she interposed. \"And,\r\nbesides, it hasn't been all bad--or has it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have agreed every little while, between jolts, that it hasn't. I'll\r\ngo further now, and say that it is the finest, truest, happiest thing\r\nthat has ever happened to me--hardships and all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean because it has given you new working material?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I wasn't thinking so much of that, though the new material, and\r\nmore especially the new angle, are worth something, of course. But there\r\nare bigger consequences than these--for me--Lucetta.\" Then he broke off\r\nand plunged headlong into something else. \"How much of an income should\r\na man have before he can ask a girl to marry him? Does the Domestic\r\nScience course include any such practical data as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all you are waiting for?\" she inquired, ignoring his question.\r\n\"Have you asked the girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I haven't asked her yet. And the money is the main thing that I\r\nshall be waiting for from this time on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say it would depend entirely upon the girl--upon what she had\r\nbeen used to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think--she hasn't--been used to having things made so very soft for\r\nher,\" he answered rather uncertainly. \"But she has at least one ambition\r\nthat is going to ask for a good chunk of money at first, until\r\nshe--until she gets ready to--to settle down.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that is----?\"\r\n\r\nThe suggestive query was never answered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"None o' that, now! Ye'll be puttin' yer hands up ower\r\nyer heids--the baith o' ye--or it'll be the waur f'r ye!\"]\r\n\r\nAs Prime laid his pipe aside and was about to speak, the dark\r\nbackgrounding of shadows beyond the circle of firelight filled suddenly\r\nwith a rush of men. Prime saw the glint of the firelight upon a pair of\r\nbrown gun-barrels, and when he mechanically reached for his own weapon a\r\nharsh voice with a broad Scottish burr in it broke raggedly into the\r\nstillness.\r\n\r\n\"None o' that, now! Ye'll be puttin' yer hands up ower yer heids--the\r\nbaith o' ye--or it'll be the waur f'r ye! I'd have ye know I'm an\r\nunder-sheriff o' this deestrict, and ye'll be reseestin' the officers o'\r\nthe law at yer eril!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIX\r\n\r\n                            IN DURANCE VILE\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIME stood up, spreading his empty hands in reasonable token of\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\n\"If you are an officer of the law we have no notion of resisting you,\"\r\nhe said placably. \"What is the charge against us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye'll be knowin' that weel enough, I'm thinkin'. Whaur's Indian Jules\r\nand the Cambon man? Maybe ye can tell me that! Aiblins ye'd better not,\r\nthough. I'll gie ye fair warnin' that whatever ye say'll be used against\r\nye.\"\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be nothing for it but an unconditional surrender. Prime\r\nlooked the posse over appraisively as the men composing it moved forward\r\ninto the circle of firelight. The under-sheriff was what his speech\r\ndeclared him to be--a Scotchman; stubby, square-built, clean-shaven,\r\nwith a graying fringe of hair over his ears, a hard-lined mouth, shrewd\r\neyes under penthouse brows, and a portentous official frown. His posse\r\nmen were apparently either \"river hogs\" or saw-mill hands--rough-looking\r\nyoung fellows giving the impression that they would obey orders with\r\nsmall regard for consequences. Prime saw nothing hopeful in the\r\nScotchman's face, but it occurred to him that a too easy yielding might\r\nbe construed as an admission of guilt.\r\n\r\n\"I take it that a false arrest and imprisonment is actionable in Canada,\r\nas well as in the United States,\" he threw out coolly, helping Lucetta\r\nto her feet. \"We'll be glad to have you take us with you--but not as\r\nprisoners.\" And thereupon he briefed for the square-built one the story\r\nof the kidnapping and its results.\r\n\r\n\"And ye're expectin' me to believe any such fule's rubbish as that?\"\r\nsnapped the Scotchman wrathfully when the tale was told.\r\n\r\n\"You can believe it or not, as you choose; it is the plain truth. We'll\r\ngo along with you cheerfully, and be grateful enough to you or to\r\nanybody who will show us the way out of this wilderness. But, as to the\r\ncrime you are charging us with, there isn't a particle of evidence, and\r\nyou know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's evidence to hang the baith of ye! Ye've admitted that the\r\nhalf-breeds are baith deid; and John Baptist will sweer that ye had\r\ntheir canoe and Cambon's gun. For the matter o' that, ye're not denyin'\r\nit, yerself.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are merely wasting time,\" put in Prime quietly. \"You evidently have\r\nno wish to be convinced; and if you are willing to take the chance of\r\nmaking a false arrest you may have your own way. Let me say first,\r\nthough, that this lady is just recovering from a severe attack of fever,\r\nand you will be held strictly accountable if you make her endure any\r\nunreasonable hardships.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis not for you to make terms,\" was the irascible rejoinder, and then\r\nto his men: \"Tie their hands, and we'll be goin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment,\" Prime interposed; and stooping swiftly he caught up the\r\nrifle. \"You may do anything you please to me, but the first man who lays\r\na hand on the lady is going to get himself killed.\"\r\n\r\nThe under-sheriff screwed out a bleak smile at the naive simplicity of\r\nthe threat. \"And if we say 'Yes,' and truss you up first,\" he\r\nsuggested, \"what'll ye be doin' then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall take your word for it as from one gentleman to another,\" was\r\nPrime's quick concession, and with that he dropped the gun and held out\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nThey bound him securely with buckskin thongs, and at a word from the\r\nScotchman the camp dunnage was gathered up, the fire trodden out, and a\r\nshift was made to the river-bank. A three-quarter moon, riding high,\r\nshowed the two captives a large birchbark drawn out upon the sands. The\r\nembarkation was quickly accomplished, the under-sheriff planting himself\r\namidships with his two prisoners, and the four posse-men taking the\r\npaddles as if they had been bred to it.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour or more of swift downstream gliding the current quickened\r\nand a sound like the wind sweeping through the tree-tops warned the\r\nvoyagers that they were approaching a rapid. At this the canoe was sent\r\nashore and the Scotchman changed places with his bow-man, letting the\r\nchange stand even after the slight hazard of quick water was passed.\r\nPrime soon saw that his new guard was nodding, and bent to whisper to\r\nhis fellow captive:\r\n\r\n\"This is mighty hard for you--after yesterday and last night,\" he\r\nprotested. \"Can't you shift a little and lean against me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am doing quite well,\" was the low-toned answer. And then: \"What is\r\ngoing to come of all this, Donald?\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall get out of the woods for one thing. And for another we are\r\ngoing to hope that a real court will not be so obstinately suspicious as\r\nthis Scotchman. But, whatever lies ahead, we must just stand by and face\r\nit out--together. They can't punish us for a crime that we didn't\r\ncommit.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence for another half-hour, and then Lucetta whispered\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Which pocket is your penknife in?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"The right-hand pocket of my waistcoat. What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to cut the thongs. It is barbarously cruel for them to leave\r\nyou tied this way!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he forbade. \"That would only make matters worse. The buckskin is\r\nnot hurting me much. Lean your head against my shoulder and see if you\r\ncan't get a little sleep.\"\r\n\r\nAt the morning breakfast halt Prime tried to extract a bit of\r\ngeographical information from the Scotchman. It was given grudgingly.\r\nDuring the night they had passed from their own river to the larger\r\nRiviere du Lievres and they were still twenty-four hours or more from\r\ntheir destination--a place with a long French name that Prime did not\r\ncatch and which the Scotchman would not repeat. For the first time in\r\ntheir wanderings the two castaways ate a meal that they had not prepared\r\nfor themselves; and Prime, observing anxiously, was glad to note that\r\nLucetta's wilderness appetite seemed to be returning.\r\n\r\nThroughout the day, during which the crew took turns paddling and\r\nsleeping, the big birch-bark held to its down-stream course. But now the\r\nscenery was changing with each fresh looping of the crooked river, the\r\nRiver of the Hares. Recent timber-cuttings appeared; the river\r\nbroadened into lake-like reaches; here and there upon the banks there\r\nwere lumber camps; in the afternoon a small town was passed, and later\r\nthe site of another that had been destroyed by a landslide.\r\n\r\nWith an eye single to his purpose, the Scotchman made no noon stop, and\r\nthe supper fire was built on the right-hand bank of the broadened stream\r\nat a spot where there were no signs of human habitation. As at the\r\nbreakfast, Prime's bonds were taken off to permit him to feed himself,\r\nand when the voyage was resumed they were not put on again.\r\n\r\n\"The wumman tells me ye can't swim, and I'm takin' her word for it,\" was\r\nthe gruff explanation. \"If ye go overboard in the night, I'll juist lat\r\nye droon.\"\r\n\r\nWith his hands free, Prime asked if he might smoke. The permission was\r\ngiven, and, since they had confiscated Prime's store of tobacco with the\r\nremainder of the dunnage, the Scotchman opened his heart and his\r\ntobacco-pouch in the prisoner's behalf, filling his own pipe at the same\r\ntime. When the dottles were glowing, the under-sheriff thawed another\r\ndegree or so.\r\n\r\n\"D'ye mean to tell me that ye're goin' to hold to that rideeculous story\r\nof yours in the coort?\" he questioned. \"It may do for auld Sandy\r\nMacdougal, the under-sheriff; but ye'll no be expectin' a jury to listen\r\ntill it.\"\r\n\r\nPrime laughed soberly. \"I wish, for your sake and our own, Mr.\r\nMacdougal, that we had a more believable story to tell. But facts are\r\nhard matters to evade. Things have happened to us precisely as I have\r\ntried to tell you. We were drugged in Quebec and abducted--carried off\r\nin an air-machine, as well as we can reason it out--and that is all\r\nthere is to it. We don't know any more than you do what we were\r\nkidnapped for--or by whom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weel, ye're a main lang ways from Quebec the noo--some twa hunnerd\r\nmiles or mair. And ye're not dressed for the timmer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly,\" said Prime.\r\n\r\nMacdougal jerked a thumb over his shoulder toward Lucetta. \"Is the\r\nwumman yer wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; we are distant cousins, though we had never met before the morning\r\nwhen we found ourselves on the shore of the big lake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye mean that ye were strangers to each ither?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just that. Up to that moment neither had known of the existence of the\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman stared hard at Prime from beneath his shaggy brows.\r\n\r\n\"Young man, ye'll juist be tellin' me what's yer business, when ye're\r\nnot trollopin' round in the timmer with a young wumman that's yer\r\ncousin, and that ye never saw or heard of before.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a fiction-writer,\" Prime admitted, not without some little anxiety\r\nas to the effect the statement might have upon the hard-headed\r\nunder-sheriff.\r\n\r\n\"Ou, ay! That's it, is it? A story-writer? And, besides that, ye're the\r\nbiggest fule leevin' to tell it to me. Ye'll no be expectin' me to\r\nbelieve anything ye're sayin', after that! A novel-writer--losh!\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the greatest Scotchmen the world ever saw was a novel-writer,\"\r\nPrime ventured to suggest.\r\n\r\n\"And it's varra little to his credit, let me tell ye that, young man!\r\n'Tis mair becomin' to Sir Walter that he was sheriff depute o'\r\nSelkirkshire and clerk o' session for abune twenty-five year on end.\r\nThat's a canty story for ye!\"\r\n\r\nPrime saw that he was making no headway with the Macdougal, and after\r\nthe pipes were out he tried to compose himself to sleep. Some time later\r\non, Macdougal changed places with one of the paddlers, and, seizing her\r\nopportunity, Lucetta crept back to take her place beside Prime. They\r\ntalked in whispers for a while, each trying to cheer the other. The\r\nmorning of new and more threatening involvements was only a short night\r\ndistant, and in the light of the month of hardship and mystery they\r\ncould only fear the worst and hope for the best.\r\n\r\n\"You must try to get what sleep you can,\" Prime urged at the last,\r\narranging the nearest blanket-roll for her back-support. \"We shall be up\r\nagainst it again in the morning, and we both ought to have clear heads\r\nand a good, cold nerve. Snuggle down and shut your eyes. I am going to\r\ndo the same after I've smoked another pipe.\"\r\n\r\nHe kept his word, dropping off shortly after the big canoe had entered a\r\nlong straight reach with twinkling lights on either shore to prove that\r\nthe moving world was once more coming within shouting distance. How long\r\nhe slept he did not know, but when he awoke the canoe was stopped in\r\nmidstream, and was lying stem to stern beside a larger craft, in the\r\nhold of which throbbing machinery seemed to be running idle.\r\n\r\nVaguely he gathered the impression that the canoe had been held up by\r\nthe motorcraft; then he realized that a fierce altercation was going on\r\nbetween a big man who was leaning over the side to grip the gunwale of\r\nthe birch bark and Under-sheriff Macdougal.\r\n\r\n\"I'll fight it out with you in any court you like, you stubborn\r\nblockhead!\" Prime heard the big man bellow at Macdougal, and then the\r\ncanoe was passed swiftly aft, somebody reached over the side and lifted\r\nhim bodily into the cockpit of the motorboat, and a moment later he\r\nfound Lucetta beside him, staring wildly and clinging to him as if he\r\nwere her only hope.\r\n\r\n\"Wha-what are they doing to us now?\" she quavered, and as she spoke the\r\ngrumbling machinery in the depths below roared a louder note, and the\r\nbig motor-craft cut a careening half-circle in midstream, leaving the\r\nbirch-bark to dance and wabble in the converging area of the furrowing\r\nbow wave. By this time Prime had shaken himself fully awake. The two\r\ndeck-hands who had pulled him and Lucetta aboard had disappeared, and\r\nthe big man who had been bullying Macdougal was at the wheel. There was\r\na single electric bulb in the centre of the cockpit awning, and by its\r\nlight Prime had his first good look at the big steersman.\r\n\r\n\"_Grider!_\" he exploded, taking a step toward the man at the wheel; and\r\nat that Miss Lucetta Millington drew herself up icily and turned her\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XX\r\n\r\n                             WATSON GRIDER\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIME had often made his fictional heroes \"see red\" in exceptionally\r\nvigorous crises, and he was now able to verify the colorful figure of\r\nspeech in his own proper person. Like a submerging wave the recollection\r\nof all that the heartless joke might have meant to a pair of helpless\r\nvictims--of all that it had actually entailed in hardships and peril and\r\nsickness--rushed over him as he faced the handsome young giant at the\r\nwheel of the motor-cruiser.\r\n\r\n\"So it _was_ you, after all!\" he gritted. Then: \"There are some few\r\nthings that won't keep, Grider. Put this boat ashore where we can have a\r\nlittle more room. The account between us is too long to wait for\r\ndaylight!\"\r\n\r\nThe barbarian's answer to this was a shout of derisive laughter, and he\r\nmade a show of putting the small steering-wheel between himself and his\r\nbelligerent passenger.\r\n\r\n\"Give me time, Don--just a little time to take it all in!\" he gurgled.\r\n\"Oh, my sainted grandmother! what a perfectly ripping fling you must\r\nhave had, to make you turn loose all holds like this! And the\r\nlady--won't you--won't you introduce me?\"\r\n\r\nLucetta faced about, and, if a look could have crippled, the\r\nmotor-cruiser would have lost its steersman.\r\n\r\n\"Cousin Donald has tried to tell me about you, but the reality is worse\r\nthan he or anybody could put into words!\" she broke out in indignant\r\nscorn. \"Of all the inhuman, dastardly things that have ever been done in\r\nthe name of a practical joke, yours is certainly the climax, Mr.\r\nGrider!\"\r\n\r\nThe young man at the wheel pursed his lips as if he were going to\r\nwhistle; then he appeared to comprehend suddenly and went off in another\r\ngust of Hudibrastic mirth.\r\n\r\n\"I've been figuring it all out as I came along up river,\" he choked;\r\n\"how you had tried to account for yourselves to each other--how you had\r\nbeen wrestling with the lack of all the little civilized knickknacks and\r\nnotions--how you'd look when you came out. Excuse me, but your--your\r\nclothes, you know; you're a pair to make a wooden idol hold his sides\r\nand chortle himself to death!\"\r\n\r\nThis seemed to be adding insult to injury, and by this time Prime was\r\nspeechless, Berserk-mad, as he himself would have written it. Nothing\r\nbut Lucetta's restraining hand upon his arm kept him from hurling\r\nhimself, reckless of consequences, upon the heartless jester. When he\r\ncould control his symptoms sufficiently to find a few coherent words, he\r\ncontrived to ease the soul-nausea--in some small measure.\r\n\r\n\"There is another day coming, Grider; don't you lose sight of that for a\r\nsingle minute!\" he raged. \"I'm not saying anything about myself; perhaps\r\nI have given you cause to assume that you can pull off your brutal\r\ninitiation stunts on me whenever you feel like it. That's all right, but\r\nyou've overdone the thing this time. Miss Millington's quarrel is my\r\nquarrel. If I can't get you in any other way, I'll post you in every\r\nclub you belong to as the man who plays horse-laugh jokes on women!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"The account between us is too long to wait for\r\ndaylight!\"]\r\n\r\nAt this outburst Grider only laughed again, appearing to be entirely and\r\nquite joyously impervious to either scorn or red rage.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I do owe you both an apology--not for the joke--that is too\r\nripping good to be spoiled--but for breaking your night's rest in that\r\npeppery Scotchman's birch-bark,\" he offered. \"If you'll duck under the\r\nraised deck, you'll find two dog-kennel staterooms. The port-side kennel\r\nis yours, Don, and the other is Miss Millington's. Suppose you turn in\r\nand get your nap out. To-morrow morning, if you still feel in the humor\r\nfor it, you can get together and give me what you seem to think is\r\ncoming to me. _Shoo!_ I can't steer this boat and play skittles with you\r\nat the same time. Run along to bed--both of you!\"\r\n\r\nWith such a case-hardened barbarian for a host, there seemed to be\r\nnothing else to be done, and Prime took Lucetta's arm and helped her\r\ndown into the tiny cabin. It was lighted, and the doors of the two\r\nbox-like staterooms were open. Prime felt for the button on the jamb of\r\nthe right-hand door and Lucetta's sleeping-niche sprang alight. She\r\nlooked in and gave a little cry of astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"My suitcases!\" she exclaimed; \"the ones I left in the Quebec hotel!\"\r\n\r\nPrime snapped the opposite switch and looked on his own side. \"My auto\r\ntrunk, too,\" he conceded sourly. \"We didn't need any more evidence, but\r\nthis is conclusive. Grider has had his horse-laugh, and the least he\r\ncould do in the wind-up was to bring us our belongings. I suppose we are\r\ncompelled to be indebted to him for getting us out of the scrape with\r\nMacdougal, much as it goes against the grain; but to-morrow we'll settle\r\nwith him.\"\r\n\r\nLucetta braced herself in her doorway against the surge and swing of the\r\nracing cruiser.\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't look like a man who could be so wholly lost to all sense\r\nof--of the fitness of things, Donald,\" she ventured, as one who would\r\nnot be immitigably vindictive.\r\n\r\n\"He looks, and acts, like a wild ass of the desert!\" Prime stormed, in a\r\nfresh access of resentment. And then: \"You'd best go to bed and get\r\nwhat sleep you can. Heaven only knows what new piece of buffoonery will\r\nbe sprung upon us to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up with the adorable little grimace, a copy of which he had\r\nlong since resolved to wish upon his next and most bewitching heroine.\r\n\r\n\"I believe you are angry yet,\" she chided, half in mockery. \"I like you\r\nbest when you don't scowl so ferociously, Cousin Donald. You forget that\r\nwe have agreed that it wasn't all bad. Good night.\" And she closed her\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nTurning out of his box-berth the next morning, Prime found the sun\r\nshining broadly in at the stateroom port-light. The motorboat was at\r\nrest and the machinery was stopped. A bath, a shave, and a complete\r\nchange to fresh haberdashery made him feel somewhat less pugnacious, and\r\nstumbling up the companion to the cockpit he saw that the cruiser was\r\ntied up at a wharf on the river fringe of a considerable city; saw,\r\nalso, that Lucetta, likewise renewed as to her outward appearance, was\r\nawaiting him.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Grider?\" he demanded shortly.\r\n\r\n\"He has gone somewhere to get an auto to take us to a hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"What city is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is Ottawa. Don't you see the government buildings up there on the\r\nhill?\"\r\n\r\nPrime was silent for a moment. Then he said: \"He needn't think he is\r\ngoing to smooth it all over by showing us a few little neighborly\r\nattentions. We are back in the good old civilized world once more, and\r\nwe are not asking any favors of Watson Grider.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I shouldn't feel that way, if I were you,\" she qualified. \"He seems\r\nvery humble and penitent this morning, though he is still twinkly-eyed,\r\nand I couldn't make him talk much. He said we'd want to be having our\r\nbreakfast, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't breakfast with him,\" was the crabbed rejoinder.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Donald!\" she protested, in a laughing mockery of deprecatory\r\nconcern. \"I believe you are still angry. You really mustn't hold spite,\r\nthat way. It isn't nice--or Bankhead-y.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked her fairly in the eyes. \"Don't begin by throwing the old\r\nminister ancestor up at me, Lucetta. I can't help the grouch, and I\r\ndon't know as I want to help it. Every time I think of you lying there\r\nunder the big spruces, sick and discouraged, suffering for the commonest\r\nnecessities and with no possible chance of getting them, I want to go\r\nout and swear like a pirate and murder somebody. Why doesn't he bring\r\nthat auto, if he is going to?\"\r\n\r\nAs if the impatient demand had evoked him, Grider appeared on the wharf\r\nand beckoned to them. Prime helped his companion up to the string-piece,\r\nand had only a scowl for their late host as Grider led the way to the\r\nstreet and a waiting auto. The barbarian stood aside while Prime was\r\nputting Lucetta into the car and clambering in after her. Then he took\r\nthe seat beside the driver, and no word was said until the car was\r\nstopped before the entrance of an up-town hotel, where Grider got down\r\nto open the tonneau door for the pair on the rear seat.\r\n\r\n\"You'll want to have your first civilized breakfast by yourselves and I\r\nshan't butt in,\" he offered good-naturedly. \"Later on, say about ten\r\no'clock, I'll be glad to see you both in the ladies' parlor--if you can\r\nforgive me that far.\"\r\n\r\nPrime made no reply, but after they were seated in the comfortable\r\nbreakfast-room and were revelling in their surroundings and in the\r\nefficient service he broke out again.\r\n\r\n\"Grider still has his brass-bound nerve with him; to ask us to meet him!\r\nI'd see him in kingdom come first, if I wasn't spoiling to tell him a\r\nfew things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he wishes to try to explain,\" came from the less vindictive\r\nside of the table-for-two. \"Think a moment, Cousin Donald: you two have\r\nbeen friends and college chums, and--and Mr. Grider has been brotherly\r\ngood to you in times past, hasn't he? And I don't want you to quarrel\r\nwith him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you have said enough to make me understand that you are doing\r\nit for my sake. That won't answer at all, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why it won't,\" Prime objected with sudden obtuseness.\r\n\r\n\"For the best possible reason; there is another woman to be considered.\r\nSooner or later she will hear that you have broken with your best friend\r\non account of a--a person she has never even heard of, and there will be\r\nconsequences.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if that is all\"--and then he laughed. \"You are either the most\r\nchildlike bit of femininity the world has ever seen--or the most\r\nwilfully blind, Lucetta.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Cousin Lucetta,'\" she corrected. \"We are back among the conventions,\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the implied readjustment of their relations rather hard.\r\n\r\n\"That wasn't worthy of you,\" he protested warmly. \"We have been too much\r\nto each other in the past month to go back of the returns in that way,\r\ndon't you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can tell better what I think after I have climbed down into my little\r\ngroove in the girls' school,\" she returned half-absently, and beyond\r\nthis the talk concerned itself with their plans for the immediate\r\nfuture, Prime still insisting that he meant to see his table companion\r\nsafely home and setting the difficulties and objections aside as one who\r\nhad a perfect right to do so.\r\n\r\nWhen the leisurely meal was finished Prime pushed his chair back and\r\nglanced at his watch.\r\n\r\n\"It is nearly ten o'clock,\" he announced. \"Shall we go and meet Grider?\r\nOr shall we give him the cold shoulder he so richly deserves and go hunt\r\nup the railroad timetables? It is for you to say.\"\r\n\r\nShe decided instantly.\r\n\r\n\"I think we ought to go and hear what Mr. Grider has to say for himself.\r\nWe owe him that much for rescuing us from that terrible old Scotch\r\nunder-sheriff.\"\r\n\r\nAnd together they sought the hotel parlors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XXI\r\n\r\n                           THE FAIRY FORTUNE\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. WATSON GRIDER was not alone when they found him. He was sharing a\r\nsofa in the public parlor with an elderly little gentleman whose\r\nwinter-apple face was decorated with mutton-chop whiskers and wreathed\r\nin smiles--the smiles of a listener who has just heard a story worth\r\nretailing at the dinner-table.\r\n\r\nThe two stood up when Prime led his companion into the room, and Grider\r\ndid the honors.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Millington, let me introduce Mr. Shellaby, an old friend of my\r\nfather's and the senior member of the firm of Shellaby, Grice, and\r\nShellaby, solicitors. Mr. Shellaby--Miss Millington and Mr. Donald\r\nPrime.\"\r\n\r\nThe little gentleman adjusted his eyeglasses and looked the pair over\r\ncarefully. Then the twinkling smile hovered again at the corners of the\r\nnear-sighted eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Are you--ah--are you aware of your relationship to this young lady,\r\nMr. Prime?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nPrime made a sign of assent. \"We figured it out one evening over our\r\ncamp-fire. We are third cousins, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" said Mr. Shellaby, matching his slender fingers and making a\r\nlittle bow. \"Now another question, if you please: Mr. Grider tells me\r\nthat you have just returned from a most singular and adventurous\r\nexperience in the wilds of the northern woods. This experience, I\r\nunderstand, was entirely involuntary on your part. Have\r\nyou--ah--formulated any theory to account for your--ah--abduction?\"\r\n\r\nPrime glanced at Grider and frowned.\r\n\r\n\"We know all we need to know about that part of it,\" he rejoined curtly.\r\n\"Mr. Grider is probably still calling it a practical joke; but we call\r\nit an outrage.\"\r\n\r\nThe little man smiled again. \"Exactly,\" he agreed; and then: \"Do you\r\nhappen to know what day of the month this is?\"\r\n\r\nPrime shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"We have lost count of the days. I kept a notched stick for a while, but\r\nI lost it along toward the last.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Shellaby waved them to chairs, saying: \"Be seated, if you please; we\r\nmay as well be comfortable as we talk. This is the last day of July.\r\nDoes that mean anything in particular to either of you?\"\r\n\r\nLucetta gave a little cry of surprise.\r\n\r\n\"It does to me,\" she said quickly. \"Did you--did you put an\r\nadvertisement in a Cleveland newspaper addressed to me, Mr. Shellaby?\"\r\n\r\n\"We did; and we also advertised for the heirs of Roger Prime, of\r\nBatavia, New York. We believed at the time that it was a mere matter of\r\nform; in fact, when we drew his will our client informed us that there\r\nwould most probably be no results. He was of the opinion that neither\r\nRoger Prime nor Clarissa Millington had left any living children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your client?\" Prime interrupted. \"May we ask who he is?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Was_,\" corrected the small man gravely. \"Mr. Jasper Bankhead died last\r\nJanuary. You didn't know him, I'm sure; quite possibly you have never\r\nheard of him until this moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"We both know of him,\" Prime amended. \"He was my great-uncle, and a\r\ncousin of Miss Millington's grandmother. He was scarcely more than a\r\nfamily tradition to either of us, however. We had both been told that he\r\nwent west as a young man and was never heard of afterward.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Shellaby nodded soberly.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bankhead was a rather peculiar character in some respects; quite\r\neccentric, in fact. He accumulated a great deal of property in British\r\nColumbia--in mining enterprises--and it was only in his latter years\r\nthat he came here to live. We drew his will, as I have said. He was\r\nwithout family, and he left the bulk of his estate--something over two\r\nmillions--to various charities and hospitals. There were other legacies,\r\nto be sure, and among them one which was to be divided equally between,\r\nor among, the direct heirs, if any could be discovered, of Clarissa\r\nMillington and Roger Prime.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if no such heirs could be found?\" Prime inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Our client was quite sure that they wouldn't be found. It seems that he\r\nhad previously had some inquiries made on his own account. For that\r\nreason he placed a comparatively short time limit upon our efforts and\r\nprescribed their form. We were to advertise in certain newspapers, and\r\nif there should be no answer within six months of the date of his death\r\nthe legacy in question was to revert to his private secretary, a young\r\nman who had served him in many capacities, and who was, by the by,\r\nalready generously provided for in a separate bequest.\"\r\n\r\nLucetta's gray eyes lighted suddenly and she spoke with a little\r\ncatching of her breath.\r\n\r\n\"The name of that young man, Mr. Shellaby, is Horace Bandish, isn't it?\"\r\nshe suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" nodded the little man; and then, with the amused twinkle\r\nreturning to point the bit of dry humor: \"I am sorry to have to spoil\r\nyour estimate of Mr. Grider's capabilities as a practical joker; yes,\r\nvery sorry, indeed; but I'm afraid I must. Bandish was your kidnapper,\r\nyou know, and it is owing entirely to Mr. Grider's energetic efforts\r\nthat the fellow is at present safely lodged in the Ottawa jail awaiting\r\nindictment and trial. In order that he might be certain of adding your\r\nlegacy to his own, he meant to deprive you both of any possible\r\nopportunity of communicating with us before July thirty-first. The young\r\nwoman who calls herself his wife was his accomplice, but she has\r\ndisappeared. Mr. Grider can give you the details of the plot better than\r\nI can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then Grider didn't--then the legacy is ours?\" Prime stammered,\r\nclutching manfully for handholds in the grapple with this entirely new\r\narray of things incredible.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely, Mr. Prime; yours and Miss Millington's. There will be some\r\nlegal formalities, to be sure, but Mr. Grider assures us that you can\r\ncomply with them. Compared with Mr. Bankhead's undivided total, the\r\namount of the legacy is not great; some two hundred thousand dollars,\r\nless the costs of administration, to be divided equally between you if\r\nyou prove to be the only surviving heirs direct of the two persons named\r\nin the will.\"\r\n\r\nPrime turned slowly upon his companion castaway.\r\n\r\n\"You said you wanted enough, but not too much,\" he reminded her\r\nsolemnly. \"I hope you're not disappointed, either way. At all events,\r\nyou'll never have to cook for a man again unless you really wish to, and\r\nyou can have your wish about the world travel, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you can have yours about the writing of the leisurely book,\" she\r\nflashed back; \"about that, and--and----\"\r\n\r\nPrime's laugh ignored the presence of Grider and the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"And the imaginary girl, you were going to say? Yes; I shall certainly\r\nmarry her, if she'll have me.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Shellaby was on his feet and bowing again.\r\n\r\n\"I think I have said all that needs to be said here and now,\" he\r\nconcluded mildly. \"If you will excuse me, I'll go. We are a rather busy\r\noffice. Later, Mr. Grider may bring you to us and we can set the legal\r\nmachinery in motion. I congratulate you both very heartily, I'm sure,\"\r\nand he shook hands all around and backed away.\r\n\r\nWhen they were left alone with the barbarian, Prime wheeled short upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Watson, will you raise your right hand and swear that this isn't\r\nanother twist in your infernal joke?\" he demanded. \"Because, if it\r\nis----\"\r\n\r\nGrider fell back into the nearest chair and chuckled like a fat boy at a\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n\"If it only were!\" he gloated. \"Wouldn't it be rich? Oh, Great Peter!\r\nwhy didn't I think of it in time and run a sham lawyer in on you? It\r\nwould have been as easy as rolling off a log. Unhappily, Don, it's all\r\ntoo true. I didn't invent it--more's the pity!\"\r\n\r\nPrime stood over the joker, menacing him with a clenched fist. \"If you\r\nwant to go on living and spending your swollen fortune, you'll tell us\r\nall the ins and outs of it,\" he rasped, in well-assumed ferocity.\r\n\r\n\"I was only waiting for an invitation,\" was the laughing rejoinder.\r\n\"When you didn't turn up in Boston to go motoring with me I ran over to\r\nNew York and broke into your rooms. On your desk I found a telegram\r\npurporting to have come from me at Quebec. Since I hadn't wired you from\r\nQuebec, or anywhere else, I began to ask questions. Your janitor\r\nanswered the first one: you had already gone to Canada. I couldn't\r\nimagine what was going on, but it seemed to be worth following up, so I\r\ntook the next train for Quebec.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you didn't wire ahead?\" said Prime.\r\n\r\n\"No; it didn't occur to me, but it wouldn't have done any good. Your\r\ndisappearance was two days old when I reached Quebec. You weren't missed\r\nmuch, but Miss Millington was; the school-teachers were milling around\r\nand raising all sorts of a row. But in another day it quieted down flat.\r\nSomebody started the story that you two had run off together to get\r\nmarried; that it had been all cut and dried between you beforehand.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was probably a part of the plot--to account for us in that way,\"\r\nLucetta put in.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt it was,\" Grider went on. \"But the elopement story didn't\r\nsatisfy me. I knew there wasn't any reason in the wide world why Don\r\nshouldn't get married openly, if he could find any girl foolish enough\r\nto say 'yes,' so I simply discounted the gossip and wired for\r\ndetectives. A very little sleuth work developed the fact that each of\r\nyou had been seen last in company with one of the Bandishes. That gave\r\nus a sort of a clew, and we began to trail Mr. Horace Bandish and dig up\r\nhis record.\"\r\n\r\n\"And while you were doing all this for us, we ... honestly, Mr. Grider,\r\nI am ashamed to tell you what we were saying of you,\" said the young\r\nwoman in penitent self-abasement.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that was all right. In times past I had given Don plenty of\r\nmaterial of that sort to work on; only I wish I had known how you were\r\nlooking at it--that you were charging it all up to me. It would have\r\nlightened the gloom immensely. But to get on: we trailed Bandish, as I\r\nsay, and found that he had had an aeroplane shipped to him at Quebec a\r\nfew days before your arrival there. That looked a bit suspicious, and a\r\nlittle more digging made it look more so. The 'plane had been unloaded\r\nand carted away, and a few days later had been brought back and shipped\r\nto Ottawa. That left a pretty plain trail, but still there was no\r\nevidence of criminality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, you didn't know anything about the legacy, at that stage of\r\nit?\" Prime threw in.\r\n\r\n\"Not a thing in the world. More than that, Bandish's record was decently\r\ngood. We found that he had been a sort of general factotum for a rich\r\nold man, and had been left comfortably well off when his employer died.\r\nThere was absolutely no motive in sight; no reason on earth why he\r\nshould drug a couple of total strangers and blot them out. Just the\r\nsame, I was confident that he had done it, and that I should eventually\r\nfind you by keeping cases on him. So I dropped the detectives, who were\r\nbeginning to give me the laugh for being so pig-headed about an ordinary\r\nelopement, gathered up your belongings on the chance that you'd need 'em\r\nif I should make good in the search for you, and came here to Ottawa to\r\nkeep in touch with Bandish.\"\r\n\r\nPrime's smile was grim. \"You were taking a lot of trouble for two people\r\nwho were just about that time calling you all the hard names in the\r\ncategory,\" he interposed.\r\n\r\n\"Wasn't I?\" said the barbarian with a grin. \"But never mind about that.\r\nI came here, as I said, and settled down to keep an eye on Horace. For\r\nquite some time I didn't learn anything new. I found that Bandish was a\r\nclub man, well known and rather popular; also that he was an amateur\r\naviator and had made a number of exhibition flights. Everybody knew him\r\nand everybody seemed to like him. In the course of time we met at one of\r\nthe clubs, and I watched him carefully when we were introduced. If he\r\nhad sent the forged telegram it was proof that he knew me by name, at\r\nleast. But he never made a sign.\r\n\r\n\"It was about a week later than this when I stumbled upon Mr. Shellaby\r\nand got my first real clew in the story of the legacy muddle. Of course,\r\nthat opened all the doors, and after that I laid for Horace like a cat\r\nwatching a mouse. Before long I could see that he was growing mighty\r\nnervous about something, and the next thing I knew he turned up missing.\r\nRight there I lost my head and wasted two whole days trying to find out\r\nwhich railroad he had taken out of town. Late in the evening of the\r\nsecond day I learned, by the merest bit of bull-headed luck, that he\r\nhad gone up the Riviere du Lievres in a motor-launch. I had a quick\r\nhunch that that motor-launch was pointing in your direction and that it\r\nwas up to me to chase him and find you and get you back here before the\r\nthirty-first. Three hours later I had borrowed the _Sprite_ and was\r\nafter him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He found us,\" said Prime, rather grittingly. \"We had stopped to patch\r\nour canoe, and he came up in the night and cut another hole in it. I\r\nmistook him for you--which was the chief reason why I didn't take a\r\npot-shot at him as he was running away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew I had no chance to overtake him,\" Grider went on, \"but it seemed\r\na safe bet that I'd get him coming out. I did; captured him, took him\r\nashore, built a fire, and told him I was going to roast him alive if he\r\ndidn't come across with the facts. He held out for a while, but finally\r\ntold me the whole of it: how he had figured to get you two together in\r\nQuebec after he had learned that you, Miss Millington, were due to be\r\nthere with the teachers. You see, he knew all about you--both of you.\r\nAs Mr. Bankhead's secretary he had made, at Mr. Bankhead's dictation,\r\nall the former inquiries, and, of course, had carefully kept the answers\r\nfrom reaching the old gentleman. With a little more cooking he told me\r\nhow he and the woman had drugged you both, after which he had carried\r\nyou in the 'plane to the shore of some unpronounceable lake in the north\r\nwoods.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he mean to do?--let us starve to death?\" Prime asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; nothing so murderous as that! He had it all doped out\r\nbeforehand. There is a Hudson Bay post on one of the streams flowing\r\ninto the lake, and he had arranged with a couple of half-breed canoe-men\r\nto happen along and pick you up and bring you back, stipulating only\r\nthat they should kill time enough to make the return trip use up the\r\nentire month of July. As the fatal date drew near, he grew uneasy and\r\nmade the launch trip to see to it personally that you were not getting\r\nalong too fast. He found your camp and cut your canoe merely to add a\r\nlittle more delay for good measure. He couldn't tell me what had become\r\nof his half-breeds.\"\r\n\r\nPrime laughed. \"I suppose the old Scotch under-sheriff told you, didn't\r\nhe?\"\r\n\r\n\"He tried to tell me that you and Miss Millington had assassinated the\r\ntwo men and stolen their canoe and outfit. You didn't do that?--or did\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly,\" Prime denied. Then he told the story of the finding of the\r\ndead men, capping it with an account of the chance visit of Jean\r\nBa'tiste.\r\n\r\nGrider left his chair and took a turn up and down the room.\r\n\r\n\"It was a great adventure,\" he declared, coming back to them. \"Some day\r\nyou are going to tell me all about it, and the kind of a time you had.\r\nI'll bet it was fierce--some parts of it, anyway. I can't answer for\r\nyou, Miss Millington; but what Don doesn't know about roughing it is--or\r\nused to be--good and plenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"You sent Bandish back to town after you were through with him?\" Prime\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I had taken a pair of handcuffs along, just on general\r\nprinciples, and I lent him my engineer to run the launch. Afterward, I\r\nkept on up-stream in the _Sprite_, hoping to meet you coming down; and\r\nhoping against hope that we would be able to beat the calendar back to\r\nOttawa.\"\r\n\r\n\"We never should have beaten it if the old Scotchman hadn't taken a\r\nhand,\" was Prime's comment. \"He saved us at least a full day.\"\r\n\r\nGrider was edging toward the door. \"I guess you don't need me any more\r\njust now,\" he offered. \"I'm due to go and thank the good-natured lumber\r\nking who lent me the _Sprite_. By and by, after the dust has settled a\r\nbit, I'll come around and show you where Mr. Shellaby holds forth.\"\r\n\r\n\"One minute, Mr. Grider,\" Lucetta interposed hastily. \"We can't let you\r\ngo without asking your forgiveness for the way in which we have been\r\nvilifying you for a whole month, and for what we both said to you last\r\nnight. I must speak for myself, at least, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't,\" said Grider, laughing again. \"It's all in the day's work. As it\r\nhappened, I wasn't the goat this time, but that isn't saying that I\r\nmightn't have done something quite as uncivilized if you had given me a\r\nchance. You two gave me one of the few perfect moments of a rather\r\nuneventful life last night when you made me understand that you were\r\ngiving me credit for the whole thing--as a joke! I only wish I could\r\ninvent one half as good. And that reminds me, Don; can you--er--do you\r\nthink you'll be able to put a real woman into the next story?\"\r\n\r\nFor some few minutes after the barbarian had ducked and disappeared a\r\nstiff little silence fell upon the two he had left behind. In writing\r\nabout it Prime would have called it an interregnum of readjustment. He\r\nhad gone to a window to stare aimlessly down into the busy street, and\r\nLucetta was sitting with her chin in her cupped palms and her eyes fixed\r\nupon the rather garish pattern of the paper on the opposite wall. After\r\na time Prime pulled himself together and went back to her.\r\n\r\n\"It is all changed, isn't it?\" he said, in a rather flat voice.\r\n\"Everything is changed. You are no longer a teacher, working for your\r\nliving. You are an heiress, with a snug little fortune in your own\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him with the bright little smile which had been brought\r\nover intact from the days of the banished conventions.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you say I am, you are,\" she retorted cheerfully. \"Only I can't\r\nquite believe it yet--about the money, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better,\" he returned gloomily. \"Besides, it is just what you said\r\nyou wanted--neither too little nor too much: one hundred thousand at a\r\ngood, safe six per cent will give you an income of six thousand a year.\r\nYou can travel on that for the remainder of your natural life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Easily,\" she rejoined. \"And you can write the leisurely book and marry\r\nthe girl. Perhaps you will be doing both while I am getting ready to go\r\non my travels. You won't insist upon going back to Ohio with me now,\r\nwill you? You--you ought to go straight to the girl, don't you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are forgetting that I said she was an imaginary girl,\" he parried.\r\n\r\n\"You said so at first; but afterward you admitted that she wasn't. Also,\r\nyou promised me you would show me her picture after we should get out of\r\nthe woods.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never had her picture,\" he denied. \"I said I would show you what\r\nshe looks like. Come to the window where the light is better.\"\r\n\r\nShe went with him half-mechanically. Between the two windows there was\r\nan old-fashioned pier-glass set in the wall. Before she realized what he\r\nwas doing he had led her before the mirror.\r\n\r\n\"There she is, Lucetta,\" he said softly; \"the only girl there is--or\r\never will be.\"\r\n\r\nShe started back with a little cry, putting out her hands as if to push\r\nhim away.\r\n\r\n\"No, Donald--a thousand times no!\" she flashed out. \"Do you think I\r\ndon't know that this is only another way of telling me how sorry you are\r\nfor me? You know well enough what people will say when they hear how we\r\nhave been together for a whole month, alone; and in your splendid\r\nchivalry you would----\"\r\n\r\nHe did not let her finish. The hotel parlor was supposed to be a public\r\nroom, but he ignored that and took her in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"From the first day, Lucetta, dear--from the very first day!\" he argued\r\npassionately. \"And it grew and grew with your absolute, your simply\r\nangelic trust in me until I was half-mad with the desire to tell you.\r\nBut I couldn't tell you then; I couldn't even let you suspect and still\r\nbe what you were believing me to be. Don't you think you could learn, in\r\ntime, you know, to--to----\"\r\n\r\nHer face was hidden, but she made her refusal quite positive.\r\n\r\n\"No, Donald, I can never learn it--again. Because, you see, in spite of\r\nthe other girl I was believing in--that you made me believe in--I--Oh,\r\nit was wicked, _wicked_!--but I couldn't help it! And all the time I was\r\nsc-scared perfectly frantic for fear you would find it out!\"\r\n\r\n\"You were, were you?\" he laughed happily. \"Perhaps I did find it\r\nout--just a little....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was something like an hour later, and an overruling Providence had\r\ngraciously preserved the privacy of the public parlor for them during\r\nthe entire length of the precious interval, when Prime looked at his\r\nwatch and said: \"Heavens, Lucetta! it's nearly noon! Let's go quickly\r\nand beard the Shellaby in his den before he goes to luncheon. The fairy\r\nfortune may escape us yet if we don't hurry up and nab it.\"\r\n\r\nShe had risen with him, and her eyes were shining when she lifted her\r\nface and let him see them.\r\n\r\n\"As if the money, or anything else in this world, could make any\r\ndifference to either of us now, Donald, dear!\" she protested, with a\r\nfine scorn of such inconsequent things as fairy fortunes.\r\n\r\nAnd Prime, seeing the unashamed love in the shining eyes, joyously\r\nagreed with her.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe End\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nThe Contents section has been modified so that the chapter titles would\r\nmatch the titles in the book.
