APPLETON AND COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the introduction of a complete series of star maps, drawn specially\r\nfor the use of the amateur and distributed through the body of the work,\r\nthus facilitating consultation, it is believed that this book makes a\r\nstep in advance of its predecessors. The maps show all of the stars\r\nvisible to the naked eye in the regions of sky represented, and, in\r\naddition, some stars that can only be seen with optical aid. The latter\r\nhave been placed in the maps as guide posts in the telescopic field to\r\nassist those who are searching for faint and inconspicuous objects\r\nreferred to in the text. As the book was not written for those who\r\npossess the equipment of an observatory, with telescopes driven by\r\nclockwork and provided with graduated circles, right ascensions and\r\ndeclinations are not given. All of the telescopic phenomena described\r\nare, however, represented in the maps. Star clusters are indicated by a\r\nconventional symbol, and nebulæ by a little white circle; while a small\r\ncross serves to mark the places where notable new stars have appeared.\r\nThe relative magnitudes of the stars are approximately shown by the\r\ndimensions of their symbols in the maps, the smaller stars being\r\nrepresented by white dots and the larger by star-shaped figures.\r\n\r\nIn regard to binary stars, it should be remembered that, in many cases,\r\ntheir distances and angles of position change so rapidly that any\r\nstatement concerning them remains valid only for a few years at the\r\nmost. There is also much confusion among the measurements announced by\r\ndifferent authorities. In general, the most recent measurements\r\nobtainable in 1900 are given in the text, but the observer who wishes to\r\nstudy close and rapid binaries will do well to revise his information\r\nabout them as frequently as possible. An excellent list of double stars\r\nkept up to date, will be found in the annual Companion to the\r\nObservatory, published in London.\r\n\r\nIn the lunar charts the plan of inserting the names of the principal\r\nformations has been preferred to that usually followed, of indicating\r\nthem only by numbers, accompanied by a key list. Even in the most\r\ndetailed charts of the moon only a part of what is visible with\r\ntelescopes can be shown, and the representation, at best, must be merely\r\napproximate. It is simply a question of what to include and what to\r\nomit; and in the present case the probable needs of the amateur observer\r\nhave governed the selection--readiness and convenience of reference\r\nbeing the chief aim.\r\n\r\nIt should, perhaps, be said here that the various chapters composing\r\nthis book--like those of \"Astronomy with an Opera-glass\"--were, in their\r\noriginal form, with the single exception of Chapter IX, published in\r\nAppletons' Popular Science Monthly. The author, it is needless to say,\r\nwas much gratified by the expressed wish of many readers that these\r\nscattered papers should be revised and collected in a more permanent\r\nform. As bearing upon the general subject of the book, a chapter has\r\nbeen added, at the end, treating on the question of the existence of\r\nplanets among the stars. This also first appeared in the periodical\r\nabove mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the author wishes for his readers as great a pleasure in\r\nthe use of the telescope as he himself has enjoyed.\r\n\r\nG.

Is not he who holds thee in his hand made king and lord of\r\n    the works of God?\"--JOHN KEPLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the pure and elevated pleasure to be derived from the possession and\r\nuse of a good telescope of three, four, five, or six inches aperture\r\nwere generally known, I am certain that no instrument of science would\r\nbe more commonly found in the homes of intelligent people. The writer,\r\nwhen a boy, discovered unexpected powers in a pocket telescope not more\r\nthan fourteen inches long when extended, and magnifying ten or twelve\r\ntimes. It became his dream, which was afterward realized, to possess a\r\nmore powerful telescope, a real astronomical glass, with which he could\r\nsee the beauties of the double stars, the craters of the moon, the spots\r\non the sun, the belts and satellites of Jupiter, the rings of Saturn,\r\nthe extraordinary shapes of the nebulæ, the crowds of stars in the Milky\r\nWay, and the great stellar clusters. And now he would do what he can to\r\npersuade others, who perhaps are not aware how near at hand it lies, to\r\nlook for themselves into the wonder-world of the astronomers.\r\n\r\nThere is only one way in which you can be sure of getting a good\r\ntelescope. First, decide how large a glass you are to have, then go to a\r\nmaker of established reputation, fix upon the price you are willing to\r\npay--remembering that good work is never cheap--and finally see that the\r\ninstrument furnished to you answers the proper tests for a telescope of\r\nits size. There are telescopes and telescopes. Occasionally a rare\r\ncombination of perfect homogeneity in the material, complete harmony\r\nbetween the two kinds of glass of which the objective is composed, and\r\nlens surfaces whose curves are absolutely right, produces a telescope\r\nwhose owner would part with his last dollar sooner than with it. Such\r\ntreasures of the lens-maker's art can not, perhaps, be commanded at\r\nwill, yet, they are turned out with increasing frequency, and the best\r\nartists are generally able, at all times, to approximate so closely to\r\nperfection that any shortcoming may be disregarded.\r\n\r\nIn what is said above I refer, of course, to the refracting telescope,\r\nwhich is the form of instrument that I should recommend to all amateurs\r\nin preference to the reflector. But, before proceeding further, it may\r\nbe well to recall briefly the principal points of difference between\r\nthese two kinds of telescopes. The purpose of a telescope of either\r\ndescription is, first, to form an image of the object looked at by\r\nconcentrating at a focus the rays of light proceeding from that object.\r\nThe refractor achieves this by means of a carefully shaped lens, called\r\nthe object glass, or objective. The reflector, on the other hand, forms\r\nthe image at the focus of a concave mirror.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMAGE AT THE FOCUS OF A LENS.]\r\n\r\nA very pretty little experiment, which illustrates these two methods of\r\nforming an optical image, and, by way of corollary, exemplifies the\r\nessential difference between refracting and reflecting telescopes, may\r\nbe performed by any one who possesses a reading glass and a magnifying\r\nhand mirror. In a room that is not too brightly illuminated pin a sheet\r\nof white paper on the wall opposite to a window that, by preference,\r\nshould face the north, or away from the position of the sun. Taking\r\nfirst the reading glass, hold it between the window and the wall\r\nparallel to the sheet of paper, and a foot or more distant from the\r\nlatter. By moving it to and fro a little you will be able to find a\r\ndistance, corresponding to the focal length of the lens, at which a\r\npicture of the window is formed on the paper. This picture, or image,\r\nwill be upside down, because the rays of light cross at the focus. By\r\nmoving the glass a little closer to the wall you will cause the picture\r\nof the window to become indistinct, while a beautiful image of the\r\nhouses, trees, or other objects of the outdoor world beyond, will be\r\nformed upon the paper. We thus learn that the distance of the image from\r\nthe lens varies with the distance of the object whose image is formed.\r\nIn precisely a similar manner an image is formed at the focus of the\r\nobject glass of a refracting telescope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMAGE AT THE FOCUS OF A CONCAVE MIRROR.]\r\n\r\nTake next your magnifying or concave mirror, and detaching the sheet of\r\npaper from the wall, hold it nearly in front of the mirror between the\r\nlatter and the window. When you have adjusted the distance to the focal\r\nlength of the mirror, you will see an image of the window projected upon\r\nthe paper, and by varying the distance, as before, you will be able to\r\nproduce, at will, pictures of nearer or more remote objects. It is in\r\nthis way that images are formed at the focus of the mirror of a\r\nreflecting telescope.\r\n\r\nNow, you will have observed that the chief apparent difference between\r\nthese two methods of forming an image of distant objects is that in the\r\nfirst case the rays of light, passing through the transparent lens, are\r\nbrought to a focus on the side opposite to that where the real object\r\nis, while in the second case the rays, being reflected from the\r\nbrilliant surface of the opaque mirror, come to a focus on the same side\r\nas that on which the object itself is. From this follows the most\r\nstriking difference in the method of using refracting and reflecting\r\ntelescopes. In the refractor the observer looks toward the object; in\r\nthe reflector he looks away from it. Sir William Herschel made his great\r\ndiscoveries with his back to the sky. He used reflecting telescopes.\r\nThis principle, again, can be readily illustrated by means of our simple\r\nexperiment with a reading glass and a magnifying mirror. Hold the\r\nreading glass between the eye and a distant object with one hand, and\r\nwith the other hand place a smaller lens such as a pocket magnifier,\r\nnear the eye, and in line with the reading glass. Move the two carefully\r\nuntil they are at a distance apart equal to the sum of the focal lengths\r\nof the lenses, and you will see a magnified image of the distant object.\r\nIn other words, you have constructed a simple refracting telescope. Then\r\ntake the magnifying mirror, and, turning your back to the object to be\r\nlooked at, use the small lens as before--that is to say, hold it between\r\nyour eye and the mirror, so that its distance from the latter is equal\r\nto the sum of the focal lengths of the mirror and the lens, and you will\r\nsee again a magnified image of the distant object. This time it is a\r\nreflecting telescope that you hold in your hands.\r\n\r\nThe magnification of the image reminds us of the second purpose which is\r\nsubserved by a telescope. A telescope, whether refracting or reflecting,\r\nconsists of two essential parts, the first being a lens, or a mirror, to\r\nform an image, and the second a microscope, called an eyepiece, to\r\nmagnify the image. The same eyepieces will serve for either the\r\nreflector or the refractor. But in order that the magnification may be\r\neffective, and serve to reveal what could not be seen without it, the\r\nimage itself must be as nearly perfect as possible; this requires that\r\nevery ray of light that forms the image shall be brought to a point in\r\nthe image precisely corresponding to that from which it emanates in the\r\nreal object. In reflectors this is effected by giving a parabolic form\r\nto the concave surface of the mirror. In refractors there is a twofold\r\ndifficulty to be overcome. In the first place, a lens with spherical\r\nsurfaces does not bend all the rays that pass through it to a focus at\r\nprecisely the same distance. The rays that pass near the outer edge of\r\nthe lens have a shorter focus than that of the rays which pass near the\r\ncenter of the lens; this is called spherical aberration. A similar\r\nphenomenon occurs with a concave mirror whose surface is spherical. In\r\nthat case, as we have seen, the difficulty is overcome by giving the\r\nmirror a parabolic instead of a spherical form. In an analogous way the\r\nspherical aberration of a lens can be corrected by altering its curves,\r\nbut the second difficulty that arises with a lens is not so easily\r\ndisposed of: this is what is called chromatic aberration. It is due to\r\nthe fact that the rays belonging to different parts of the spectrum\r\nhave different degrees of refrangibility, or, in other words, that they\r\ncome to a focus at different distances from the lens; and this is\r\nindependent of the form of the lens. The blue rays come to a focus\r\nfirst, then the yellow, and finally the red. It results from this\r\nscattering of the spectral rays along the axis of the lens that there is\r\nno single and exact focus where all meet, and that the image of a star,\r\nfor instance, formed by an ordinary lens, even if the spherical\r\naberration has been corrected, appears blurred and discolored. There is\r\nno such difficulty with a mirror, because there is in that case no\r\nrefraction of the light, and consequently no splitting up of the\r\nelements of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nIn order to get around the obstacle formed by chromatic aberration it is\r\nnecessary to make the object glass of a refractor consist of two lenses,\r\neach composed of a different kind of glass. One of the most interesting\r\nfacts in the history of the telescope is that Sir Isaac Newton could see\r\nno hope that chromatic aberration would be overcome, and accordingly\r\nturned his attention to the improvement of the reflecting telescope and\r\ndevised a form of that instrument which still goes under his name. And\r\neven after Chester More Hall in 1729, and John Dollond in 1757, had\r\nshown that chromatic aberration could be nearly eliminated by the\r\ncombination of a flint-glass lens with one of crown glass, William\r\nHerschel, who began his observations in 1774, devoted his skill entirely\r\nto the making of reflectors, seeing no prospect of much advance in the\r\npower of refractors.\r\n\r\nA refracting telescope which has been freed from the effects of\r\nchromatic aberration is called achromatic. The principle upon which its\r\nconstruction depends is that by combining lenses of different dispersive\r\npower the separation of the spectral colors in the image can be\r\ncorrected while the convergence of the rays of light toward a focus is\r\nnot destroyed. Flint glass effects a greater dispersion than crown glass\r\nnearly in the ratio of three to two. The chromatic combination consists\r\nof a convex lens of crown backed by a concave, or plano-concave, lens of\r\nflint. When these two lenses are made of focal lengths which are\r\ndirectly proportional to their dispersions, they give a practically\r\ncolorless image at their common focus. The skill of the telescope-maker\r\nand the excellence of his work depend upon the selection of the glasses\r\nto be combined and his manipulation of the curves of the lenses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ACHROMATIC OBJECT GLASS.\r\n\r\n_a_, crown glass; _b_, flint glass.]\r\n\r\nNow, the reader may ask, \"Since reflectors require no correction for\r\ncolor dispersion, while that correction is only approximately effected\r\nby the combination of two kinds of lenses and two kinds of glass in a\r\nrefractor, why is not the reflector preferable to the refractor?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer is, that the refractor gives more light and better\r\ndefinition. It is superior in the first respect because a lens transmits\r\nmore light than a mirror reflects. Professor Young has remarked that\r\nabout eighty-two per cent of the light reaches the eye in a good\r\nrefractor, while \"in a Newtonian reflector, in average condition, the\r\npercentage seldom exceeds fifty per cent, and more frequently is lower\r\nthan higher.\" The superiority of the refractor in regard to definition\r\narises from the fact that any distortion at the surface of a mirror\r\naffects the direction of a ray of light three times as much as the same\r\ndistortion would do at the surface of a lens. And this applies equally\r\nboth to permanent errors of curvature and to temporary distortions\r\nproduced by strains and by inequality of temperature. The perfect\r\nachromatism of a reflector is, of course, a great advantage, but the\r\nchromatic aberration of refractors is now so well corrected that their\r\ninferiority in that respect may be disregarded. It must be admitted that\r\nreflectors are cheaper and easier to make, but, on the other hand, they\r\nrequire more care, and their mirrors frequently need resilvering, while\r\nan object glass with reasonable care never gets seriously out of order,\r\nand will last for many a lifetime.\r\n\r\nEnough has now, perhaps, been said about the respective properties of\r\nobject glasses and mirrors, but a word should be added concerning\r\neyepieces. Without a good eyepiece the best telescope will not perform\r\nwell. The simplest of all eyepieces is a single double-convex lens. With\r\nsuch a lens the magnifying power of the telescope is measured by the\r\nratio of the focal length of the objective to that of the eye lens.\r\nSuppose the first is sixty inches and the latter half an inch; then the\r\nmagnifying power will be a hundred and twenty diameters--i. e., the disk\r\nof a planet, for instance, will be enlarged a hundred and twenty times\r\nalong each diameter, and its area will be enlarged the square of a\r\nhundred and twenty, or fourteen thousand four hundred times. But in\r\nreckoning magnifying power, diameter, not area, is always considered.\r\nFor practical use an eyepiece composed of an ordinary single lens is\r\nseldom advantageous, because good definition can only be obtained in the\r\ncenter of the field. Lenses made according to special formulæ, however,\r\nand called solid eyepieces, give excellent results, and for high powers\r\nare often to be preferred to any other. The eyepieces usually furnished\r\nwith telescopes are, in their essential principles, compound\r\nmicroscopes, and they are of two descriptions, \"positive\" and\r\n\"negative.\" The former generally goes under the name of its inventor,\r\nRamsden, and the latter is named after great Dutch astronomer, Huygens.\r\nThe Huygens eyepiece consists of two plano-convex lenses whose focal\r\nlengths are in the ratio of three to one. The smaller lens is placed\r\nnext to the eye. Both lenses have their convex surfaces toward the\r\nobject glass, and their distance apart is equal to half the sum of their\r\nfocal lengths. In this kind of eyepiece the image is formed between the\r\ntwo lenses, and if the work is properly done such an eyepiece is\r\nachromatic. It is therefore generally preferred for mere seeing\r\npurposes. In the Ramsden eyepiece two plano-convex lenses are also used,\r\nbut they are of equal focal length, are placed at a distance apart equal\r\nto two thirds of the focal length of either, and have their convex sides\r\nfacing one another. With such an eyepiece the image viewed is beyond the\r\nfarther or field lens instead of between the two lenses, and as this\r\nfact renders it easier to adjust wires or lines for measuring purposes\r\nin the focus of the eyepiece, the Ramsden construction is used when a\r\nmicrometer is to be employed. In order to ascertain the magnifying power\r\nwhich an eyepiece gives when applied to a telescope it is necessary to\r\nknow the equivalent, or combined, focal length of the two lenses. Two\r\nsimple rules, easily remembered, supply the means of ascertaining this.\r\nThe equivalent focal length of a negative or Huygens eyepiece is equal\r\nto half the focal length of the larger or field lens. The equivalent\r\nfocal length of a positive or Ramsden eyepiece is equal to three fourths\r\nof the focal length of either of the lenses. Having ascertained the\r\nequivalent focal length of the eyepiece, it is only necessary to divide\r\nit into the focal length of the object glass (or mirror) in order to\r\nknow the magnifying power of your telescope when that particular\r\neyepiece is in use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEGATIVE EYEPIECE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POSITIVE EYEPIECE.]\r\n\r\nA first-class object glass (or mirror) will bear a magnifying power of\r\none hundred to the inch of aperture when the air is in good\r\ncondition--that is, if you are looking at stars. If you are viewing the\r\nmoon, or a planet, better results will always be obtained with lower\r\npowers--say fifty to the inch at the most. And under ordinary\r\natmospheric conditions a power of from fifty to seventy-five to the inch\r\nis far better for stars than a higher power. With a five-inch telescope\r\nthat would mean from two hundred and fifty to three hundred and\r\nseventy-five diameters, and such powers should only be applied for the\r\nsake of separating very close double stars. As a general rule, the\r\nlowest power that will distinctly show what you desire to see gives the\r\nbest results. The experienced observer never uses as high powers as the\r\nbeginner does. The number of eyepieces purchased with a telescope should\r\nnever be less than three--a very low power--say ten to the inch; a very\r\nhigh power, seventy-five or one hundred to the inch, for occasional use;\r\nand a medium power--say forty to the inch--for general use. If you can\r\nafford it, get a full battery of eyepieces--six or eight, or a\r\ndozen--for experience shows that different objects require different\r\npowers in order to be best seen, and, moreover, a slight change of power\r\nis frequently a great relief to the eye.\r\n\r\nThere is one other thing of great importance to be considered in\r\npurchasing a telescope--the mounting. If your glass is not well mounted\r\non a steady and easily managed stand, you might better have spent your\r\nmoney for something more useful. I have endured hours of torment while\r\ntrying to see stars through a telescope that was shivering in the wind\r\nand dancing to every motion of the bystanders, to say nothing of the\r\nwriggling contortions caused by the application of my own fingers to the\r\nfocusing screw. The best of all stands is a solid iron pillar firmly\r\nfastened into a brick or stone pier, sunk at least four feet in the\r\nground, and surmounted by a well-made equatorial bearing whose polar\r\naxis has been carefully placed in the meridian. It can be readily\r\nprotected from the weather by means of a wooden hood or a rubber sheet,\r\nwhile the tube of the telescope may be kept indoors, being carried out\r\nand placed on its bearing only when observations are to be made. With\r\nsuch a mounting you can laugh at the observatories with their cumbersome\r\ndomes, for the best of all observatories is the open air. But if you\r\ndislike the labor of carrying and adjusting the tube every time it is\r\nused, and are both fond of and able to procure luxuries, then, after\r\nall, perhaps, you had better have the observatory, dome, draughts and\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe next best thing in the way of a mounting is a portable tripod stand.\r\nThis may be furnished either with an equatorial bearing for the\r\ntelescope, or an altazimuth arrangement which permits both up-and-down\r\nand horizontal motions. The latter is cheaper than the equatorial and\r\nproportionately inferior in usefulness and convenience. The essential\r\nprinciple of the equatorial bearing is motion about two axes placed at\r\nright angles to one another. When the polar axis is in the meridian, and\r\ninclined at an angle equal to the latitude of the place, the telescope\r\ncan be moved about the two axes in such a way as to point to any quarter\r\nof the sky, and the motion of a star, arising from the earthy rotation,\r\ncan be followed hour after hour without disturbing the instrument. When\r\nthus mounted, the telescope may be driven by clockwork, or by hand with\r\nthe aid of a screw geared to a handle carrying a universal joint.\r\n\r\nAnd now for testing the telescope. It has already been remarked that the\r\nexcellence of a telescope depends upon the perfection of the image\r\nformed at the focus of the objective. In what follows I have only a\r\nrefractor in mind, although the same principles would apply to a\r\nreflector. With a little practice anybody who has a correct eye can form\r\na fair judgment of the excellence of a telescopic image. Suppose we have\r\nour telescope steadily mounted out of doors (if you value your peace of\r\nmind you will not try to use a telescope pointed out of a window,\r\nespecially in winter), and suppose we begin our observations with the\r\npole star, employing a magnifying power of sixty or seventy to the inch.\r\nOur first object is to see if the optician has given us a good glass. If\r\nthe air is not reasonably steady we had better postpone our experiment\r\nto another night, because we shall find that the star as seen in the\r\ntelescope flickers and \"boils,\" and behaves in so extraordinary a\r\nfashion that there is no more definition in the image than there is\r\nsteadiness in a bluebottle buzzing on a window pane. But if the night is\r\na fine one the star image will be quiescent, and then we may note the\r\nfollowing particulars: The real image is a minute bright disk, about one\r\nsecond of arc in diameter if we are using a four-and-a-half or five-inch\r\ntelescope, and surrounded by one very thin ring of light, and the\r\nfragments, so to speak, of one or possibly two similar rings a little\r\nfarther from the disk, and visible, perhaps, only by glimpses. These\r\n\"diffraction rings\" arise from the undulatory nature of light, and their\r\ndistance apart as well as the diameter of the central disk depend upon\r\nthe length of the waves of light. If the telescope is a really good one,\r\nand both object glass and eyepiece are properly adjusted, the disk will\r\nbe perfectly round, slightly softer at the edge, but otherwise equally\r\nbright throughout; and the ring or rings surrounding it will be exactly\r\nconcentric, and not brighter on one side than on another. Even if our\r\ntelescope were only two inches or two inches and a half in aperture we\r\nshould at once notice a little bluish star, the mere ghost of a star in\r\na small telescope, hovering near the polar star. It is the celebrated\r\n\"companion,\" but we shall see it again when we have more time to study\r\nit. Now let us put the star out of focus by turning the focusing screw.\r\nSuppose we turn it in such a way that the eyepiece moves slightly\r\noutside the focus, or away from the object glass. Very beautiful\r\nphenomena immediately begin to make their appearance. A slight motion\r\noutward causes the little disk to expand perceptibly, and just as this\r\nexpansion commences, a bright-red point appears at the precise center of\r\nthe disk. But, the outward motion continuing, this red center\r\ndisappears, and is replaced by a blue center, which gradually expands\r\ninto a sort of flare over the middle of the disk. The disk itself has in\r\nthe mean time enlarged into a series of concentric bright rings,\r\ngraduated in luminosity with beautiful precision from center toward\r\ncircumference. The outermost ring is considerably brighter, however,\r\nthan it would be if the same gradation applied to it as applies to the\r\ninner rings, and it is surrounded, moreover, on its outer edge by a\r\nslight flare which tends to increase its apparent width. Next let us\r\nreturn to the focus and then move the eyepiece gradually inside the\r\nfocal point or plane. Once more the star disk expands into a series of\r\ncircles, and, if we except the color phenomena noticed outside the\r\nfocus, these circles are precisely like those seen before in\r\narrangement, in size, and in brightness. If they were not the same, we\r\nshould pronounce the telescope to be imperfect. There is one other\r\ndifference, however, besides the absence of the blue central flare, and\r\nthat is a faint reddish edging around the outer ring when the expansion\r\ninside the focus is not carried very far. Upon continuing to move the\r\neyepiece inside or outside the focus we observe that the system of rings\r\nbecomes larger, while the rings themselves rapidly increase in number,\r\nbecoming at the same time individually thinner and fainter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STAR IMAGE.]\r\n\r\nBy studying the appearance of the star disk when in focus and of the\r\nrings when out of focus on either side, an experienced eye can readily\r\ndetect any fault that a telescope may have. The amateur, of course, can\r\nonly learn to do this by considerable practice. Any glaring and serious\r\nfault, however, will easily make itself manifest. Suppose, for example,\r\nwe observe that the image of a star instead of being perfectly round is\r\noblong, and that a similar defect appears in the form of the rings when\r\nthe eyepiece is put out of focus. We know at once that something is\r\nwrong; but the trouble may lie either in the object glass, in the\r\neyepiece, in the eye of the observer himself, or in the adjustment of\r\nthe lenses in the tube. A careful examination of the image and the\r\nout-of-focus circles will enable us to determine with which of these\r\nsources of error we have to deal. If the star image when in focus has a\r\nsort of wing on one side, and if the rings out of focus expand\r\neccentrically, appearing wider and larger on one side than on the other,\r\nbeing at the same time brightest on the least expanded side, then the\r\nobject glass is probably not at right angles to the axis of the tube and\r\nrequires readjustment. That part of the object glass on the side where\r\nthe rings appear most expanded and faintest needs to be pushed slightly\r\ninward. This can be effected by means of counterscrews placed for that\r\npurpose in or around the cell. But it, after we have got the object\r\nglass properly squared to the axis of the tube or the line of sight, the\r\nimage and the ring system in and out of focus still appear oblong, the\r\nfault of astigmatism must exist either in the objective, the eyepiece,\r\nor the eye. The chances are very great that it is the eye itself that is\r\nat fault. We may be certain of this if we find, on turning the head so\r\nas to look into the telescope with the eye in different positions, that\r\nthe oblong image turns with the head of the observer, keeping its major\r\naxis continually in the same relative position with respect to the eye.\r\nThe remedy then is to consult an oculist and get a pair of cylindrical\r\neyeglasses. If the oblong image does not turn round with the eye, but\r\ndoes turn when the eyepiece is twisted round, then the astigmatism is in\r\nthe latter. If, finally, it does not follow either the eye or the\r\neyepiece, it is the objective that is at fault.\r\n\r\nBut instead of being oblong, the image and the rings may be misshapen in\r\nsome other way. If they are three-cornered, it is probable that the\r\nobject glass is subjected to undue pressure in its cell. This, if the\r\ntelescope has been brought out on a cool night from a warm room, may\r\narise from the unequal contraction of the metal work and the glass as\r\nthey cool off. In fact, no good star image can be got while a telescope\r\nis assuming the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere. Even the air\r\ninclosed in the tube is capable of making much trouble until its\r\ntemperature has sunk to the level of that outside. Half an hour at least\r\nis required for a telescope to adjust itself to out-of-door temperature,\r\nexcept in the summer time, and it is better to allow an hour or two for\r\nsuch adjustment in cold weather. Any irregularity in the shape of the\r\nrings which persists after the lenses have been accurately adjusted and\r\nthe telescope has properly cooled may be ascribed to imperfections, such\r\nas veins or spots of unequal density in the glass forming the objective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OUT-OF-FOCUS RINGS.\r\n\r\n1, Correct figure; 2 and 3, spherical aberration.]\r\n\r\nThe spherical aberration of an object glass may be undercorrected or\r\novercorrected. In the former case the central rings inside the focus\r\nwill appear faint and the outer ones unduly strong, while outside the\r\nfocus the central rings will be too bright and the outer ones too\r\nfeeble. But if the aberration is overcorrected the central rings will be\r\noverbright inside the focus and abnormally faint outside the focus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO VIEWS OF MARS IN 1892.\r\n\r\nThe smaller with a three-and-three-eighths-inch telescope; the larger\r\nwith a nine-inch.]\r\n\r\nAssuming that we have a telescope in which no obvious fault is\r\ndiscernible, the next thing is to test its powers in actual work. In\r\nwhat is to follow I shall endeavor to describe some of the principal\r\nobjects in the heavens from which the amateur observer may expect to\r\nderive pleasure and instruction, and which may at the same time serve\r\nas tests of the excellence of his telescope. No one should be deterred\r\nor discouraged in the study of celestial objects by the apparent\r\ninsignificance of his means of observation. The accompanying pictures of\r\nthe planet Mars may serve as an indication of the fact that a small\r\ntelescope is frequently capable of doing work that appears by no means\r\ncontemptible when placed side by side with that of the greater\r\ninstruments of the observatories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nIN THE STARRY HEAVENS\r\n\r\n\"Now constellations, Muse, and signs rehearse;\r\nIn order let them sparkle in thy verse.\"--MANILIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us imagine ourselves the happy possessors of three properly mounted\r\ntelescopes of five, four, and three inches aperture, respectively. A\r\nfine midwinter evening has come along, the air is clear, cool, and\r\nsteady, and the heavens, of that almost invisible violet which is\r\nreserved for the lovers of celestial scenery, are spangled with stars\r\nthat hardly twinkle. We need not disturb our minds about a few thin\r\nclouds here and there floating lazily in the high air; they announce a\r\nchange of weather, but they will not trouble us to-night.\r\n\r\nWhich way shall we look? Our eyes will answer the question for us.\r\nHowever we may direct them, they instinctively return to the south, and\r\nare lifted to behold Orion in his glory, now near the meridian and\r\nmidway to the zenith, with Taurus shaking the glittering Pleiades before\r\nhim, and Canis Major with the flaming Dog Star following at his heels.\r\n\r\nNot only is Orion the most brilliant of all constellations to the casual\r\nstar-gazer, but it contains the richest mines that the delver for\r\ntelescopic treasures can anywhere discover. We could not have made a\r\nbetter beginning, for here within a space of a few square degrees we\r\nhave a wonderful variety of double stars and multiple stars, so close\r\nand delicate as to test the powers of the best telescopes, besides a\r\nprofusion of star-clusters and nebulæ, including one of the supreme\r\nmarvels of space, the Great Nebula in the Sword.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 1.]\r\n\r\nOur star map No. 1 will serve as a guide to the objects which we are\r\nabout to inspect. Let us begin operations with our smallest telescope,\r\nthe three-inch. I may remark here that, just as the lowest magnifying\r\npower that will clearly reveal the object looked for gives ordinarily\r\nbetter results than a higher power, so the smallest telescope that is\r\ncompetent to show what one wishes to see is likely to yield more\r\nsatisfaction, as far as that particular object is concerned, than a\r\nlarger glass. The larger the object glass and the higher the power, the\r\ngreater are the atmospheric difficulties. A small telescope will perform\r\nvery well on a night when a large one is helpless.\r\n\r\nTurn the glass upon beta (Rigel), the white first-magnitude star in\r\nOrion's left foot. Observe whether the image with a high power is clear,\r\nsharp, and free from irregular wisps of stray light. Look at the rings\r\nin and out of focus, and if you are satisfied with the performance, try\r\nfor the companion. A good three-inch is certain to show it, except in a\r\nbad state of the atmosphere, and even then an expert can see it, at\r\nleast by glimpses. The companion is of the ninth magnitude, some say the\r\neighth, and the distance is about 9.5\", angle of position (hereafter\r\ndesignated by p.) 199°.[1] Its color is blue, in decided contrast with\r\nthe white light of its great primary. Sir John Herschel, however, saw\r\nthe companion red, as others have done. These differences are doubtless\r\ndue to imperfections of the eye or the telescope. In 1871 Burnham\r\nbelieved he had discovered that the companion was an exceedingly close\r\ndouble star. No one except Burnham himself succeeded in dividing it, and\r\nhe could only do so at times. Afterward, when he was at Mount Hamilton,\r\nhe tried in vain to split it with the great thirty-six-inch telescope,\r\nin 1889, 1890, and 1891. His want of success induced him to suggest that\r\nthe component stars were in rapid motion, and so, although he admitted\r\nthat it might not be double after all, he advised that it should be\r\nwatched for a few years longer. His confidence was justified, for in\r\n1898 Aitken, with the Lick telescope, saw and measured the distance of\r\nthe extremely minute companion--distance 0.17\", p. 177°.\r\n\r\n[1] The angle of position measures the inclination to the meridian of a\r\nline drawn between the principal star and its companion; in other words,\r\nit shows in what direction from the primary we must look for the\r\ncompanion. It is reckoned from 0° up to 360°, beginning at the north\r\npoint and passing around by east through south and west to north again.\r\nThus, if the angle of position is 0° or 360°, the companion is on the\r\nnorth side of the primary; if the angle is 90°, the companion is to the\r\neast; if 180°, to the south; if 270°, to the west, and so for\r\nintermediate angles. It must be remembered, however, that in the field\r\nof the telescope the top is south and the bottom north, unless a prism\r\nis used, when directions become complicated. East and west can be\r\nreadily identified by noticing the motion of a star through the field;\r\nit moves toward the west and from the east.\r\n\r\nRigel has been suspected of a slight degree of variability. It is\r\nevidently a star of enormous actual magnitude, for its parallax escapes\r\ntrustworthy measurement. It can only be ranked among the very first of\r\nthe light-givers of the visible universe. Spectroscopically it belongs\r\nto a peculiar type which has very few representatives among the bright\r\nstars, and which has been thus described: \"Spectra in which the hydrogen\r\nlines and the few metallic lines all appear to be of equal breadth and\r\nsharp definition.\" Rigel shows a line which some believe to represent\r\nmagnesium; but while it has iron lines in its spectrum, it exhibits no\r\nevidence of the existence of any such cloud of volatilized iron as that\r\nwhich helps to envelop the sun.\r\n\r\nFor another test of what the three-inch will do turn to zeta, the lower,\r\nor left-hand, star in the Belt. This is a triple, the magnitudes being\r\nsecond, sixth, and tenth. The sixth-magnitude star is about 2.5\" from\r\nthe primary, p. 149°, and has a very peculiar color, hard to describe.\r\nIt requires careful focusing to get a satisfactory view of this star\r\nwith a three-inch telescope. Use magnifying powers up to two hundred and\r\nfifty diameters. With our four-inch the star is much easier, and the\r\nfive-inch shows it readily with a power of one hundred. The\r\ntenth-magnitude companion is distant 56\", p. 8°, and may be glimpsed\r\nwith the three-inch. Upon the whole, we shall find that we get more\r\npleasing views of zeta Orionis with the four-inch glass.\r\n\r\nJust to the left of zeta, and in the same field of view with a very low\r\npower, is a remarkable nebula bearing the catalogue number 1227. We must\r\nuse our five-inch on this with a low power, but with zeta out of the\r\nfield in order to avoid its glare. The nebula is exceedingly faint, and\r\nwe can be satisfied if we see it simply as a hazy spot, although with\r\nmuch larger telescopes it has appeared at least half a degree broad.\r\nTempel saw several centers of condensation in it, and traced three or\r\nfour broad nebulous streams, one of which decidedly suggested spiral\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nThe upper star in the Belt, delta, is double; distance, 53\", p. 360°;\r\nmagnitudes, second and seventh very nearly; colors, white and green or\r\nblue. This, of course, is an easy object for the three-inch with a low\r\nmagnifying power. It would be useless to look for the two fainter\r\ncompanions of delta, discovered by Burnham, even with our five-inch\r\nglass. But we shall probably need the five-inch for our next attempt,\r\nand it will be well to put on a high power, say three hundred diameters.\r\nThe star to be examined is the little brilliant dangling below the\r\nright-hand end of the Belt, toward Rigel. It appears on the map as eta.\r\nSpare no pains in getting an accurate focus, for here is something worth\r\nlooking at, and unless you have a trained eye you will not easily see\r\nit. The star is double, magnitudes third and sixth, and the distance\r\nfrom center to center barely exceeds 1\", p. 87°. A little tremulousness\r\nof the atmosphere for a moment conceals the smaller star, although its\r\npresence is manifest from the peculiar jutting of light on one side of\r\nthe image of the primary. But in an instant the disturbing undulations\r\npass, the air steadies, the image shrinks and sharpens, and two points\r\nof piercing brightness, almost touching one another, dart into sight,\r\nthe more brilliant one being surrounded by an evanescent circle, a tiny\r\nripple of light, which, as it runs round the star and then recedes,\r\nalternately embraces and releases the smaller companion. The wash of the\r\nlight-waves in the atmosphere provokes many expressions of impatience\r\nfrom the astronomer, but it is often a beautiful phenomenon\r\nnevertheless.\r\n\r\nBetween eta and delta is a fifth-magnitude double star, Sigma 725, which\r\nis worth a moment's attention. The primary, of a reddish color, has a\r\nvery faint star, eleventh magnitude, at a distance of 12.7\", p. 88°.\r\n\r\nStill retaining the five-inch in use, we may next turn to the other end\r\nof the Belt, where, just under zeta, we perceive the fourth-magnitude\r\nstar sigma. He must be a person of indifferent mind who, after looking\r\nwith unassisted eyes at the modest glimmering of this little star, can\r\nsee it as the telescope reveals it without a thrill of wonder and a cry\r\nof pleasure. The glass, as by a touch of magic, changes it from one into\r\neight or ten stars. There are two quadruple sets three and a half\r\nminutes of arc apart. The first set exhibits a variety of beautiful\r\ncolors. The largest star, of fourth magnitude, is pale gray; the second\r\nin rank, seventh magnitude, distance 42\", p. 61°, presents a singular\r\nred, \"grape-red\" Webb calls it; the third, eighth magnitude, distance\r\n12\", p. 84°, is blue; and the fourth, eleventh magnitude, distance 12\",\r\np. 236°, is apparently white. Burnham has doubled the fourth-magnitude\r\nstar, distance 0.23\". The second group of four stars consists of three\r\nof the eighth to ninth magnitude, arranged in a minute triangle with a\r\nmuch fainter star near them. Between the two quadruple sets careful\r\ngazing reveals two other very faint stars. While the five-inch gives a\r\nmore satisfactory view of this wonderful multiple star than any smaller\r\ntelescope can do, the four-inch and even the three-inch would have shown\r\nit to us as a very beautiful object. However we look at them, there is\r\nan appearance of association among these stars, shining with their\r\ncontrasted colors and their various degrees of brilliance, which is\r\nsignificant of the diversity of conditions and circumstances under which\r\nthe suns and worlds beyond the solar walk exist.\r\n\r\nFrom sigma let us drop down to see the wonders of Orion's Sword\r\ndisplayed just beneath. We can use with advantage any one of our three\r\ntelescopes; but since we are going to look at a nebula, it is fortunate\r\nthat we have a glass so large as five inches aperture. It will reveal\r\ninteresting things that escape the smaller instruments, because it\r\ngrasps more than one and a half times as much light as the four-inch,\r\nand nearly three times as much as the three-inch; and in dealing with\r\nnebulæ a plenty of light is the chief thing to be desired. The middle\r\nstar in the Sword is theta, and is surrounded by the celebrated Nebula\r\nof Orion. The telescope shows theta separated into four stars arranged\r\nat the corners of an irregular square, and shining in a black gap in the\r\nnebula. These four stars are collectively named the Trapezium. The\r\nbrightest is of the sixth magnitude, the others are of the seventh,\r\nseven and a half, and eighth magnitudes respectively. The radiant mist\r\nabout them has a faint greenish tinge, while the four stars, together\r\nwith three others at no great distance, which follow a fold of the\r\nnebula like a row of buttons on a coat, always appear to me to show an\r\nextraordinary liveliness of radiance, as if the strange haze served to\r\nset them off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TRAPEZIUM WITH THE FIFTH AND SIXTH STARS.]\r\n\r\nOur three-inch would have shown the four stars of the Trapezium\r\nperfectly well, and the four-inch would have revealed a fifth star, very\r\nfaint, outside a line joining the smallest of the four and its nearest\r\nneighbor. But the five-inch goes a step farther and enables us, with\r\nsteady gazing to see even a sixth star, of only the twelfth magnitude,\r\njust outside the Trapezium, near the brightest member of the quartet.\r\nThe Lick telescope has disclosed one or two other minute points of light\r\nassociated with the Trapezium. But more interesting than the Trapezium\r\nis the vast cloud, full of strange shapes, surrounding it. Nowhere else\r\nin the heavens is the architecture of a nebula so clearly displayed. It\r\nis an unfinished temple whose gigantic dimensions, while exalting the\r\nimagination, proclaim the omnipotence of its builder. But though\r\nunfinished it is not abandoned. The work of creation is proceeding\r\nwithin its precincts. There are stars apparently completed, shining like\r\ngems just dropped from the hand of the polisher, and around them are\r\nmasses, eddies, currents, and swirls of nebulous matter yet to be\r\ncondensed, compacted, and constructed into suns. It is an education in\r\nthe nebular theory of the universe merely to look at this spot with a\r\ngood telescope. If we do not gaze at it long and wistfully, and return\r\nto it many times with unflagging interest, we may be certain that there\r\nis not the making of an astronomer in us.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the Orion nebula do not fail to notice an\r\neighth-magnitude star, a short distance northeast of the Great Nebula,\r\nand nearly opposite the broad opening in the latter that leads in toward\r\nthe gap occupied by the Trapezium. This star is plainly enveloped in\r\nnebulosity, that is unquestionably connected with the larger mass of\r\nwhich it appears to form a satellite.\r\n\r\nAt the lower end of the Sword is the star iota, somewhat under the third\r\nmagnitude. Our three-inch will show that it has a bluish companion of\r\nseventh or eighth magnitude, at a little more than 11\" distance, p.\r\n142°, and the larger apertures will reveal a third star, of tenth\r\nmagnitude, and reddish in color, distance 49\", p. 103°. Close by iota we\r\nfind the little double star Sigma 747, whose components are of five and\r\na half and six and a half magnitudes respectively, and separated 36\", p.\r\n223°. Above the uppermost star in the Sword is a small star cluster, No.\r\n1184, which derives a special interest from the fact that it incloses a\r\ndelicate double star, Sigma 750, whose larger component is of the sixth\r\nmagnitude, while the smaller is of the ninth, and the distance is only\r\n4.3\", p. 59°. We may try the four-inch on this object.\r\n\r\nHaving looked at alpha (Betelgeuse), the great topaz star on Orion's\r\nright shoulder, and admired the splendor of its color, we may turn the\r\nfour-inch upon the star Sigma 795, frequently referred to by its number\r\nas \"52 Orionis.\" It consists of one star of the sixth and another of\r\nsixth and a half magnitude, only 1.5\" apart, p. 200°. Having separated\r\nthem with a power of two hundred and fifty diameters on the four-inch,\r\nwe may try them with a high power on the three-inch. We shall only\r\nsucceed this time if our glass is of first-rate quality and the air is\r\nperfectly steady.\r\n\r\nThe star lambda in Orion's head presents an easy conquest for the\r\nthree-inch, as it consists of a light-yellow star of magnitude three and\r\na half and a reddish companion of the sixth magnitude; distance 4\", p.\r\n43°. There is also a twelfth-magnitude star at 27\", p. 183°, and a tenth\r\nor eleventh magnitude one at 149\", p. 278°. These are tests for the\r\nfive-inch, and we must not be disappointed if we do not succeed in\r\nseeing the smaller one even with that aperture.\r\n\r\nOther objects in Orion, to be found with the aid of our map, are: Sigma\r\n627, a double star, magnitude six and a half and seven, distance 21\", p.\r\n260°; Omicron Sigma 98, otherwise named iota Orionis, double, magnitude\r\nsix and seven, distance 1\", p. 180°, requires five-inch glass; Sigma\r\n652, double, magnitudes six and a half and eight, distance 1.7\", p.\r\n184°; rho, double, magnitudes five and eight and a half, the latter\r\nblue, distance 7\", p. 62°, may be tried with a three-inch; tau, triple\r\nstar, magnitudes four, ten and a half, and eleven, distances 36\", p.\r\n249°, and 36\", p. 60°. Burnham discovered that the ten-and-a-half\r\nmagnitude star is again double, distance 4\", p. 50°. There is not much\r\nsatisfaction in attempting tau Orionis with telescopes of ordinary\r\napertures; Sigma 629 otherwise _m_ Orionis, double, magnitudes five and\r\na half (greenish) and seven, distance 31.7\", p. 28°, a pretty object;\r\nSigma 728, otherwise A 32, double, magnitudes five and seven, distance,\r\n0.5\" or less, p. 206°, a rapid binary,[2] which is at present too close\r\nfor ordinary telescopes, although it was once within their reach; Sigma\r\n729, double, magnitudes six and eight, distance 2\", p. 26°, the smaller\r\nstar pale blue--try it with a four-inch, but five-inch is better; Sigma\r\n816, double, magnitudes six and half and eight and a half, distance 4\",\r\np. 289°; psi 2, double, magnitudes five and a half and eleven, distance\r\n3\", or a little less, p. 322°; 905, star cluster, contains about twenty\r\nstars from the eighth to the eleventh magnitude; 1267, nebula, faint,\r\ncontaining a triple star of the eighth magnitude, two of whose\r\ncomponents are 51\" apart, while the third is only 1.7\" from its\r\ncompanion, p. 85°; 1376, star cluster, small and crowded; 1361, star\r\ncluster, triangular shape, containing thirty stars, seventh to tenth\r\nmagnitudes, one of which is a double, distance 2.4\".\r\n\r\n[2] The term \"binary\" is used to describe double stars which are in\r\nmotion about their common center of gravity.\r\n\r\nLet us now leave the inviting star-fields of Orion and take a glance at\r\nthe little constellation of Lepus, crouching at the feet of the mythical\r\ngiant. We may begin with a new kind of object, the celebrated red\r\nvariable R Leporis (map No. 1). This star varies from the sixth or\r\nseventh magnitude to magnitude eight and a half in a period of four\r\nhundred and twenty-four days. Hind's picturesque description of its\r\ncolor has frequently been quoted. He said it is \"of the most intense\r\ncrimson, resembling a blood-drop on the black ground of the sky.\" It is\r\nimportant to remember that this star is reddest when faintest, so that\r\nif we chance to see it near its maximum of brightness it will not\r\nimpress us as being crimson at all, but rather a dull, coppery red. Its\r\nspectrum indicates that it is smothered with absorbing vapors, a sun\r\nnear extinction which, at intervals, experiences an accession of energy\r\nand bursts through its stifling envelope with explosive radiance, only\r\nto faint and sink once more. It is well to use our largest aperture in\r\nexamining this star.\r\n\r\nWe may also employ the five-inch for an inspection of the double star\r\niota, whose chief component of the fifth magnitude is beautifully tinged\r\nwith green. The smaller companion is very faint, eleventh magnitude, and\r\nthe distance is about 13\", p. 337°.\r\n\r\nAnother fine double in Lepus is kappa, to be found just below iota; the\r\ncomponents are of the fifth and eighth magnitudes, pale yellow and blue\r\nrespectively, distance 2.5\", p. 360°; the third-magnitude star alpha has\r\na tenth-magnitude companion at a distance of 35\", p. 156°, and its\r\nneighbor beta (map No. 2), according to Burnham, is attended by three\r\neleventh-magnitude stars, two of which are at distances of 206\", p. 75°,\r\nand 240\", p. 58°, respectively, while the third is less than 3\" from\r\nbeta, p. 288°; the star gamma (map No. 2) is a wide double, the distance\r\nbeing 94\", and the magnitudes four and eight. The star numbered 45 is a\r\nremarkable multiple, but the components are too faint to possess much\r\ninterest for those who are not armed with very powerful telescopes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 2.]\r\n\r\nFrom Lepus we pass to Canis Major (map No. 2). There is no hope of our\r\nbeing able to see the companion of alpha (Sirius), at present (1901),\r\neven with our five-inch. Discovered by Alvan Clark with an eighteen-inch\r\ntelescope in 1862, when its distance was 10\" from the center of Sirius,\r\nthis ninth-magnitude star has since been swallowed up in the blaze of\r\nits great primary. At first, it slightly increased its distance, and\r\nfrom 1868 until 1879 most of the measures made by different observers\r\nconsiderably exceeded 11\". Then it began to close up, and in 1890 the\r\ndistance scarcely exceeded 4\". Burnham was the last to catch sight of it\r\nwith the Lick telescope in that year. After that no human eye saw it\r\nuntil 1896, when it was rediscovered at the Lick Observatory. Since\r\nthen the distance has gradually increased to nearly 5\". According to\r\nBurnham, its periodic time is about fifty-three years, and its nearest\r\napproach to Sirius should have taken place in the middle of 1892. Later\r\ncalculations reduce the periodic time to forty-eight or forty-nine\r\nyears. If we can not see the companion of the Dog Star with our\r\ninstruments, we can at least, while admiring the splendor of that\r\ndazzling orb, reflect with profit upon the fact that although the\r\ncompanion is ten thousand times less bright than Sirius, it is half as\r\nmassive as its brilliant neighbor. Imagine a subluminous body half as\r\nponderous as the sun to be set revolving round it somewhere between\r\nUranus and Neptune. Remember that that body would possess one hundred\r\nand sixty-five thousand times the gravitating energy of the earth, and\r\nthat five hundred and twenty Jupiters would be required to equal its\r\npower of attraction, and then consider the consequences to our\r\neasy-going planets! Plainly the solar system is not cut according to the\r\nSirian fashion. We shall hardly find a more remarkable coupling of\r\ncelestial bodies until we come, on another evening, to a star that\r\nbegan, ages ago, to amaze the thoughtful and inspire the superstitious\r\nwith dread--the wonderful Algol in Perseus.\r\n\r\nWe may remark in passing that Sirius is the brightest representative of\r\nthe great spectroscopic type I, which includes more than half of all the\r\nstars yet studied, and which is characterized by a white or bluish-white\r\ncolor, and a spectrum possessing few or at best faint metallic lines,\r\nbut remarkably broad, black, and intense lines of hydrogen. The\r\ninference is that Sirius is surrounded by an enormous atmosphere of\r\nhydrogen, and that the intensity of its radiation is greater, surface\r\nfor surface, than that of the sun. There is historical evidence to\r\nsupport the assertion, improbable in itself, that Sirius, within\r\neighteen hundred years, has changed color from red to white.\r\n\r\nWith either of our telescopes we shall have a feast for the eye when we\r\nturn the glass upon the star cluster No. 1454, some four degrees south\r\nof Sirius. Look for a red star near the center. Observe the curving rows\r\nso suggestive of design, or rather of the process by which this cluster\r\nwas evolved out of a pre-existing nebula. You will recall the winding\r\nstreams in the Great Nebula of Orion. Another star cluster worth a\r\nmoment's attention is No. 1479, above and to the left of Sirius. We had\r\nbetter use the five-inch for this, as many of the stars are very faint.\r\nNot far away we find the double star , whose components are of the fifth\r\nand eighth magnitudes, distance 2.8\", p. 343°. The small star is pale\r\nblue. Cluster No. 1512 is a pleasing object with our largest aperture.\r\nIn No. 1511 we have a faint nebula remarkable for the rows of minute\r\nstars in and near it. The star gamma is an irregular variable. In 1670\r\nit is said to have almost disappeared, while at the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century it was more than twice as bright as it is to-day. The\r\nreddish star delta is also probably variable. In my \"Astronomy with an\r\nOpera Glass\" will be found a cut showing a singular array of small stars\r\npartly encircling delta. These are widely scattered by a telescope, even\r\nwith the lowest power.\r\n\r\nEastward from Canis Major we find some of the stars of Argo Navis. Sigma\r\n1097, of the sixth magnitude, has two minute companions at 20\" distance,\r\np. 311° and 312°. The large star is itself double, but the distance,\r\n0.8\", p. 166°, places it beyond our reach. According to Burnham, there\r\nis yet a fourth faint star at 31\", p. 40°. Some three degrees and a half\r\nbelow and to the left of the star just examined is a beautiful star\r\ncluster, No. 1551. Nos. 1564, 1571, and 1630 are other star clusters\r\nwell worth examination. A planetary nebula is included in 1564. With\r\nvery powerful telescopes this nebula has been seen ring-shaped. Sigma\r\n1146, otherwise known as 5 Navis, is a pretty double, colors pale yellow\r\nand blue, magnitudes five and seven, distance 3.25\", p. 19°. Our\r\nthree-inch will suffice for this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 3.]\r\n\r\nNorth of Canis Major and Argo we find Monoceros and Canis Minor (map No.\r\n3). The stars forming the western end of Monoceros are depicted on map\r\nNo. 1. We shall begin with these. The most interesting and beautiful is\r\n11, a fine triple star, magnitudes five, six, and seven, distances 7.4\",\r\np. 131°, and 2.7\", p. 103°. Sir William Herschel regarded this as one of\r\nthe most beautiful sights in the heavens. It is a good object to try our\r\nthree-inch on, although it should not be difficult for such an aperture.\r\nThe star 4 is also a triple, magnitudes six, ten, and eleven, distances\r\n3.4\", p. 178°, and 10\", p. 244°. We should glance at the star 5 to\r\nadmire its fine orange color. In 8 we find a golden fifth-magnitude\r\nstar, combined with a blue or lilac star of the seventh magnitude,\r\ndistance 14\", p. 24°. Sigma 938 is a difficult double, magnitudes six\r\nand a half and twelve, distance 10\", p. 210°. Sigma 921 is double,\r\nmagnitudes six and a half and eight, distance 16\", p. 4°. At the spot\r\nmarked on the map 1424 we find an interesting cluster containing one\r\nstar of the sixth magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe remaining stars of Monoceros will be found on map No. 3. The double\r\nand triple stars to be noted are S, or Sigma 950 (which is also a\r\nvariable and involved in a faint nebula), magnitudes six and nine,\r\ndistance 2.5\", p. 206°; Sigma 1183, double, magnitudes five and a half\r\nand eight, distance 31\", p. 326°; Sigma 1190, triple, magnitudes five\r\nand a half, ten, and nine, distances 31\", p. 105°, and 67\", p. 244°.\r\nThe clusters are 1465, which has a minute triple star near the center;\r\n1483, one member of whose swarm is red; 1611, very small but rich; and\r\n1637, interesting for the great number of ninth-magnitude stars that it\r\ncontains. We should use the five-inch for all of these.\r\n\r\nCanis Minor and the Head of Hydra are also contained on map No. 3.\r\nProcyon, alpha of Canis Minor, has several minute stars in the same\r\nfield of view. There is, besides, a companion which, although it was\r\nknown to exist, no telescope was able to detect until November, 1896. It\r\nmust be of immense mass, since its attraction causes perceptible\r\nperturbations in the motion of Procyon. Its magnitude is eight and a\r\nhalf, distance 4.83\", p. 338°. One of the small stars just referred to,\r\nthe second one east of Procyon, distant one third of the moon's\r\ndiameter, is an interesting double. Our four-inch may separate it, and\r\nthe five-inch is certain to do so. The magnitudes are seven and seven\r\nand a half or eight, distance 1.2\", p. 133°. This star is variously\r\nnamed Sigma 1126 and 31 Can. Min. Bode. Star No. 14 is a wide triple,\r\nmagnitudes six, seven, and eight, distances 75, p. 65°, and 115\", p.\r\n154°.\r\n\r\nPROCYON AND ITS NEIGHBORS.\r\n\r\nIn the Head of Hydra we find Sigma 1245, a double of the sixth and\r\nseventh magnitudes, distance 10.5\", p. 25°. The larger star shows a fine\r\nyellow. In epsilon we have a beautiful combination of a yellow with a\r\nblue star, magnitudes four and eight, distance 3.4\", p. 198°. Finally,\r\nlet us look at theta for a light test with the five-inch. The two stars\r\ncomposing it are of the fourth and twelfth magnitudes, distance 50\", p.\r\n170°.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant constellations of Gemini and Taurus tempt us next, but\r\nwarning clouds are gathering, and we shall do well to house our\r\ntelescopes and warm our fingers by the winter fire. There will be other\r\nbright nights, and the stars are lasting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFROM GEMINI TO LEO AND ROUND ABOUT\r\n\r\n\"If thou wouldst gaze on starry Charioteer,\r\nAnd hast heard legends of the wondrous Goat,\r\nVast looming shalt thou find on the Twins' left,\r\nHis form bowed forward.\"--POSTE'S ARATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe zodiacal constellations of Gemini, Cancer, and Leo, together with\r\ntheir neighbors Auriga, the Lynx, Hydra, Sextans, and Coma Berenices,\r\nwill furnish an abundance of occupation for our second night at the\r\ntelescope. We shall begin, using our three-inch glass, with alpha, the\r\nchief star of Gemini (map No. 4). This is ordinarily known as Castor.\r\nEven an inexperienced eye perceives at once that it is not as bright as\r\nits neighbor Pollux, beta. Whether this fact is to be regarded as\r\nindicating that Castor was brighter than Pollux in 1603, when Bayer\r\nattached their Greek letters, is still an unsettled question. Castor may\r\nor may not be a variable, but it is, at any rate, one of the most\r\nbeautiful double stars in the heavens. A power of one hundred is amply\r\nsufficient to separate its components, whose magnitudes are about two\r\nand three, the distance between them being 6\", p. 226°. A slight yet\r\ndistinct tinge of green, recalling that of the Orion nebula, gives a\r\npeculiar appearance to this couple. Green is one of the rarest colors\r\namong the stars. Castor belongs to the same general spectroscopic type\r\nin which Sirius is found, but its lines of hydrogen are broader than\r\nthose seen in the spectrum of the Dog Star. There is reason for\r\nthinking that it may be surrounded with a more extensive atmosphere of\r\nthat gaseous metal called hydrogen than any other bright star possesses.\r\nThere seems to be no doubt that the components of Castor are in\r\nrevolution around their common center of gravity, although the period is\r\nuncertain, varying in different estimates all the way from two hundred\r\nand fifty to one thousand years; the longer estimate is probably not far\r\nfrom the truth. There is a tenth-magnitude star, distance 73\", p. 164°,\r\nwhich may belong to the same system.\r\n\r\nFrom Castor let us turn to Pollux, at the same time exchanging our\r\nthree-inch telescope for the four-inch, or, still better, the five-inch.\r\nPollux has five faint companions, of which we may expect to see three,\r\nas follows: Tenth magnitude, distance 175\", p. 70°; nine and a half\r\nmagnitude, distance 206\", p. 90°, and ninth magnitude, distance 229\", p.\r\n75°. Burnham has seen a star of thirteen and a half magnitude, distance\r\n43\", p. 275°, and has divided the tenth-magnitude star into two\r\ncomponents, only 1.4\" apart, the smaller being of the thirteenth\r\nmagnitude, and situated at the angle 128°. A calculation based on Dr.\r\nElkin's parallax of 0.068\" for Pollux shows that that star may be a\r\nhundredfold more luminous than the sun, while its nearest companion may\r\nbe a body smaller than our planet Jupiter, but shining, of course, by\r\nits own light. Its distance from Pollux, however, exceeds that of\r\nJupiter from the sun in the ratio of about one hundred and thirty to\r\none.\r\n\r\nIn the double star pi we shall find a good light test for our three-inch\r\naperture, the magnitudes being six and eleven, distance 22\", p. 212°.\r\nThe four-inch will show that kappa is a double, magnitudes four and ten,\r\ndistance 6\", p. 232°. The smaller star is of a delicate blue color, and\r\nit has been suspected of variability. That it may be variable is\r\nrendered the more probable by the fact that in the immediate\r\nneighborhood of kappa there are three undoubted variables, S, T, and U,\r\nand there appears to be some mysterious law of association which causes\r\nsuch stars to group themselves in certain regions. None of the variables\r\njust named ever become visible to the naked eye, although they all\r\nundergo great changes of brightness, sinking from the eighth or ninth\r\nmagnitude down to the thirteenth or even lower. The variable R, which\r\nlies considerably farther west, is well worth attention because of the\r\nremarkable change of color which it sometimes exhibits. It has been seen\r\nblue, red, and yellow in succession. It varies from between the sixth\r\nand seventh magnitudes to less than the thirteenth in a period of about\r\ntwo hundred and forty-two days.\r\n\r\nNot far away we find a still more curious variable zeta; this is also an\r\ninteresting triple star, its principal component being a little under\r\nthe third magnitude, while one of the companions is of the seventh\r\nmagnitude, distance 90\", p. 355°, and the other is of the eleventh\r\nmagnitude or less, distance 65\", p. 85°. We should hardly expect to see\r\nthe fainter companion with the three-inch. The principal star varies\r\nfrom magnitude three and seven tenths down to magnitude four and a half\r\nin a period of a little more than ten days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WONDERFUL NEBULA IN GEMINI (1532).]\r\n\r\nWith the four-or five-inch we get a very pretty sight in delta, which\r\nappears split into a yellow and a purple star, magnitudes three and\r\neight, distance 7\", p. 206°.\r\n\r\nNear delta, toward the east, lies one of the strangest of all the\r\nnebulæ. (See the figures 1532 on the map.) Our telescopes will show it\r\nto us only as a minute star surrounded with a nebulous atmosphere, but\r\nits appearance with instruments of the first magnitude is so\r\nastonishing and at the same time so beautiful that I can not refrain\r\nfrom giving a brief description of it as I saw it in 1893 with the great\r\nLick telescope. In the center glittered the star, and spread evenly\r\naround it was a circular nebulous disk, pale yet sparkling and\r\nconspicuous. This disk was sharply bordered by a narrow _black_ ring,\r\nand outside the ring the luminous haze of the nebula again appeared,\r\ngradually fading toward the edge to invisibility. The accompanying cut,\r\nwhich exaggerates the brightness of the nebula as compared with the\r\nstar, gives but a faint idea of this most singular object. If its\r\npeculiarities were within the reach of ordinary telescopes, there are\r\nfew scenes in the heavens that would be deemed equally admirable.\r\n\r\nIn the star eta we have another long-period variable, which is also a\r\ndouble star; unfortunately the companion, being of only the tenth\r\nmagnitude and distant less than 1\" from its third-magnitude primary, is\r\nbeyond the reach of our telescopes. But eta points the way to one of the\r\nfinest star clusters in the sky, marked 1360 on the map. The naked eye\r\nperceives that there is something remarkable in that place, and the\r\nopera glass faintly reveals its distant splendors, but the telescope\r\nfairly carries us into its presence. Its stars are innumerable, varying\r\nfrom the ninth magnitude downward to the last limit of visibility, and\r\npresenting a wonderful array of curves which are highly interesting from\r\nthe point of view of the nebular origin of such clusters. Looking\r\nbackward in time, with that theory to guide us, we can see spiral lines\r\nof nebulous mist occupying the space that now glitters with interlacing\r\nrows of stars. It is certainly difficult to understand how such lines of\r\nnebula could become knotted with the nuclei of future stars, and then\r\ngradually be absorbed into those stars; and yet, if such a process does\r\nnot occur, what is the meaning of that narrow nebulous streak in the\r\nPleiades along which five or six stars are strung like beads on a\r\nstring? The surroundings of this cluster, 1360, as one sweeps over them\r\nwith the telescope gradually drawing toward the nucleus, have often\r\nreminded me of the approaches to such a city as London. Thicker and\r\ncloser the twinkling points become, until at last, as the observers eye\r\nfollows the gorgeous lines of stars trending inward, he seems to be\r\nentering the streets of a brilliantly lighted metropolis.\r\n\r\nOther objects in Gemini that we can ill miss are: , double, magnitudes\r\nthree and eleven, distance 73\", p. 76°, colors yellow and blue; 15,\r\ndouble, magnitudes six and eight, distance 33\", p. 205°; gamma,\r\nremarkable for array of small stars near it; 38, double, magnitudes six\r\nand eight, distance 6.5\", p. 162°, colors yellow and blue (very pretty);\r\nlambda, double, magnitudes four and eleven, distance 10\", p. 30°, color\r\nof larger star blue--try with the five-inch; epsilon, double, magnitudes\r\nthree and nine, distance 110\", p. 94°.\r\n\r\nFrom Gemini we pass to Cancer. This constellation has no large stars,\r\nbut its great cluster Præsepe (1681 on map No. 4) is easily seen as a\r\nstarry cloud with the naked eye. With the telescope it presents the most\r\nbrilliant appearance with a very low power. It was one of the first\r\nobjects that Galileo turned to when he had completed his telescope, and\r\nhe wonderingly counted its stars, of which he enumerated thirty-six, and\r\nmade a diagram showing their positions.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting star in Cancer is zeta, a celebrated triple. The\r\nmagnitudes of its components are six, seven, and seven and a half;\r\ndistances 1.14\", p. 6°, and 5.7\", p. 114°. We must use our five-inch\r\nglass in order satisfactorily to separate the two nearest stars. The\r\ngravitational relationship of the three stars is very peculiar. The\r\nnearest pair revolve around their common center in about fifty-eight\r\nyears, while the third star revolves with the other two, around a center\r\ncommon to all three, in a period of six or seven hundred years. But the\r\nmovements of the third star are erratic, and inexplicable except upon\r\nthe hypothesis advanced by Seeliger, that there is an invisible, or\r\ndark, star near it by whose attraction its motion is perturbed.\r\n\r\nIn endeavoring to picture the condition of things in zeta Cancri we\r\nmight imagine our sun to have a companion sun, a half or a third as\r\nlarge as itself, and situated within what may be called planetary\r\ndistance, circling with it around their center of gravity; while a third\r\nsun, smaller than the second and several times as far away, and\r\naccompanied by a _black_ or non-luminous orb, swings with the first two\r\naround another center of motion. There you would have an entertaining\r\ncomplication for the inhabitants of a system of planets!\r\n\r\nOther objects in Cancer are: Sigma 1223, double star, magnitudes six and\r\nsix and a half, distance 5\", p. 214°; Sigma 1291, double, magnitudes\r\nboth six, distance 1.3\", p. 328°--four-inch should split it; iota,\r\ndouble, magnitudes four and a half and six and a half, distance 30\", p.\r\n308°; 66, double magnitudes six and nine, distance 4.8\", p. 136°; Sigma\r\n1311, double, magnitudes both about the seventh, distance 7\", p. 200°;\r\n1712, star cluster, very beautiful with the five-inch glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 5.]\r\n\r\nThe constellation of Auriga may next command our attention (map No. 5).\r\nThe calm beauty of its leading star Capella awakens an admiration that\r\nis not diminished by the rivalry of Orion's brilliants glittering to the\r\nsouth of it. Although Capella must be an enormously greater sun than\r\nours, its spectrum bears so much resemblance to the solar spectrum that\r\na further likeness of condition is suggested. No close telescopic\r\ncompanion to Capella has been discovered. A ninth-magnitude companion,\r\ndistant 159\", p. 146°, and two others, one of twelfth magnitude at 78\",\r\np. 317°, the other of thirteenth magnitude at 126\", p. 183°, may be\r\ndistant satellites of the great star, but not planets in the ordinary\r\nsense, since it is evident that they are self-luminous. It is a\r\nsignificant fact that most of the first-magnitude stars have faint\r\ncompanions which are not so distant as altogether to preclude the idea\r\nof physical relationship.\r\n\r\nBut while Capella has no visible companion, Campbell, of the Lick\r\nObservatory, has lately discovered that it is a conspicuous example of a\r\npeculiar class of binary stars only detected within the closing decade\r\nof the nineteenth century. The nature of these stars, called\r\nspectroscopic binaries, may perhaps best be described while we turn our\r\nattention from Capella to the second star in Auriga beta (Menkalina),\r\nwhich not only belongs to the same class, but was the first to be\r\ndiscovered. Neither our telescopes, nor any telescope in existence, can\r\ndirectly reveal the duplicity of beta Aurigæ to the eye--i. e., we can\r\nnot see the two stars composing it, because they are so close that their\r\nlight remains inextricably mingled after the highest practicable\r\nmagnifying power has been applied in the effort to separate them. But\r\nthe spectroscope shows that the star is double and that its components\r\nare in rapid revolution around one another, completing their orbital\r\nswing in the astonishingly short period of _four days_! The combined\r\nmass of the two stars is estimated to be two and a half times the mass\r\nof the sun, and the distance between them, from center to center, is\r\nabout eight million miles.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the spectroscope revealed the existence of two\r\nstars in beta Aurigæ is a beautiful illustration of the unexpected and,\r\nso to speak, automatic application of an old principle in the discovery\r\nof new facts not looked for. It was noticed at the Harvard Observatory\r\nthat the lines in the photographed spectrum of beta Aurigæ (and of a few\r\nother stars to be mentioned later) appeared single in some of the\r\nphotographs and double in others. Investigation proved that the lines\r\nwere doubled at regular intervals of about two days, and that they\r\nappeared single in the interim. The explanation was not far to seek. It\r\nis known that all stars which are approaching us have their spectral\r\nlines shifted, by virtue of their motion of approach, toward the violet\r\nend of the spectrum, and that, for a similar reason, all stars which are\r\nreceding have their lines shifted toward the red end of the spectrum.\r\nNow, suppose two stars to be revolving around one another in a plane\r\nhorizontal, or nearly so, to the line of sight. When they are at their\r\ngreatest angular distance apart as seen from the earth one of them will\r\nevidently be approaching at the same moment that the other is receding.\r\nThe spectral lines of the first will therefore be shifted toward the\r\nviolet, and those of the second will be shifted toward the red. Then if\r\nthe stars, when at their greatest distance apart, are still so close\r\nthat the telescope can not separate them, their light will be combined\r\nin the spectrum; but the spectral lines, being simultaneously shifted in\r\nopposite directions, will necessarily appear to be doubled. As the\r\nrevolution of the stars continues, however, it is clear that their\r\nmotion will soon cease to be performed in the line of sight, and will\r\nbecome more and more athwart that line, and as this occurs the spectral\r\nlines will gradually assume their normal position and appear single.\r\nThis is the sequence of phenomena in beta Aurigæ. And the same sequence\r\nis found in Capella and in several other more or less conspicuous stars\r\nin various parts of the heavens.\r\n\r\nSuch facts, like those connecting rows and groups of stars with masses\r\nand spiral lines of nebula are obscure signboards, indicating the\r\nopening of a way which, starting in an unexpected direction, leads deep\r\ninto the mysteries of the universe.\r\n\r\nSouthward from beta we find the star theta, which is a beautiful\r\nquadruple. We shall do best with our five-inch here, although in a fine\r\ncondition of the atmosphere the four-inch might suffice. The primary is\r\nof the third magnitude; the first companion is of magnitude seven and a\r\nhalf, distance 2\", p. 5°; the second, of the tenth magnitude, distance\r\n45\", p. 292°; and the third, of the tenth magnitude, distance 125\", p.\r\n350°.\r\n\r\nWe should look at the double Sigma 616 with one of our larger apertures\r\nin order to determine for ourselves what the colors of the components\r\nare. There is considerable diversity of opinion on this point. Some say\r\nthe larger star is pale red and the smaller light blue; others consider\r\nthe color of the larger star to be greenish, and some have even called\r\nit white. The magnitudes are five and nine, distance 6\", p. 350°.\r\n\r\nAuriga contains several noteworthy clusters which will be found on the\r\nmap. The most beautiful of these is 1295, in which about five hundred\r\nstars have been counted.\r\n\r\nThe position of the new star of 1892, known as Nova Aurigæ, is also\r\nindicated on the map. While this never made a brilliant appearance, it\r\ngave rise to a greater variety of speculative theories than any previous\r\nphenomenon of the kind. Although not recognized until January 24, 1892,\r\nthis star, as photographic records prove, was in existence on December\r\n9, 1891. At its brightest it barely exceeded magnitude four and a half,\r\nand its maximum occurred within ten days after its first recognition.\r\nWhen discovered it was of the fifth magnitude. It was last seen in its\r\noriginal form with the Lick telescope on April 26th, when it had sunk to\r\nthe lowest limit of visibility. To everybody's astonishment it\r\nreappeared in the following August, and on the 17th of that month was\r\nseen shining with the light of a tenth-magnitude star, _but presenting\r\nthe spectrum of a nebula!_ Its visual appearance in the great telescope\r\nwas now also that of a planetary nebula. Its spectrum during the first\r\nperiod of its visibility had been carefully studied, so that the means\r\nexisted for making a spectroscopic comparison of the phenomenon in its\r\ntwo phases. During the first period, when only a stellar spectrum was\r\nnoticed, remarkable shiftings of the spectral lines occurred, indicating\r\nthat two and perhaps three bodies were concerned in the production of\r\nthe light of the new star, one of which was approaching the earth, while\r\nthe other or the others receded with velocities of several hundred miles\r\nper second! On the revival in the form of a planetary nebula, while the\r\ncharacter of the spectrum had entirely changed, evidences of rapid\r\nmotion in the line of sight remained.\r\n\r\nBut what was the meaning of all this? Evidently a catastrophe of some\r\nkind had occurred out there in space. The idea of a collision involving\r\nthe transformation of the energy of motion into that of light and heat\r\nsuggests itself at once. But what were the circumstances of the\r\ncollision? Did an extinguished sun, flying blindly through space, plunge\r\ninto a vast cloud of meteoric particles, and, under the lashing impact\r\nof so many myriads of missiles, break into superficial incandescence,\r\nwhile the cosmical wrack through which it had driven remained glowing\r\nwith nebulous luminosity? Such an explanation has been offered by\r\nSeeliger. Or was Vogel right when he suggested that Nova Aurigæ could\r\nbe accounted for by supposing that a wandering dark body had run into\r\ncollision with a system of planets surrounding a decrepit sun (and\r\ntherefore it is to be hoped uninhabited), and that those planets had\r\nbeen reduced to vapor and sent spinning by the encounter, the second\r\noutburst of light being caused by an outlying planet of the system\r\nfalling a prey to the vagabond destroyer? Or some may prefer the\r\nexplanation, based on a theory of Wilsing's, that _two_ great bodies,\r\npartially or wholly opaque and non-luminous at their surfaces, but\r\nliquid hot within, approached one another so closely that the tremendous\r\nstrain of their tidal attraction burst their shells asunder so that\r\ntheir bowels of fire gushed briefly visible, amid a blaze of spouting\r\nvapors. And yet Lockyer thinks that there was no solid or semisolid mass\r\nconcerned in the phenomenon at all, but that what occurred was simply\r\nthe clash of two immense swarms of meteors that had crossed one\r\nanother's track.\r\n\r\nWell, where nobody positively knows, everybody has free choice. In the\r\nmeantime, look at the spot in the sky where that little star made its\r\nappearance and underwent its marvelous transformation, for, even if you\r\ncan see no remains of it there, you will feel your interest in the\r\nproblem it has presented, and in the whole subject of astronomy, greatly\r\nheightened and vivified, as the visitor to the field of Waterloo becomes\r\na lover of history on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe remaining objects of special interest in Auriga may be briefly\r\nmentioned: 26, triple star, magnitudes five, eight, and eleven,\r\ndistances 12\", p. 268°, and 26\", p. 113°; 14, triple star, magnitudes\r\nfive, seven and a half, and eleven, distances 14\", p. 224°, and 12.6\",\r\np. 342°, the last difficult for moderate apertures; lambda, double,\r\nmagnitudes five and nine, distance 121\", p. 13°; epsilon, variable,\r\ngenerally of third magnitude, but has been seen of only four and a half\r\nmagnitude; 41, double, magnitudes five and six, distance 8\", p. 354°;\r\n996, 1067, 1119, and 1166, clusters all well worth inspection, 1119\r\nbeing especially beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe inconspicuous Lynx furnishes some fine telescopic objects, all\r\ngrouped near the northwestern corner of the constellation. Without a\r\nsix-inch telescope it would be a waste of time to attack the double star\r\n4, whose components are of sixth and eighth magnitudes, distance 0.8\",\r\np. 103°; but its neighbor, 5, a fine triple, is within our reach, the\r\nmagnitudes being six, ten, and eight, distances 30\", p. 139°, and 96\",\r\np. 272°. In 12 Lyncis we find one of the most attractive of triple\r\nstars, which in good seeing weather is not beyond the powers of a\r\nthree-inch glass, although we shall have a far more satisfactory view of\r\nit with the four-inch. The components are of the sixth, seventh, and\r\neighth magnitudes, distances 1.4\", p. 117°, and 8.7\", p. 304°. A\r\nmagnifying power which just suffices clearly to separate the disks of\r\nthe two nearer stars makes this a fine sight. A beautiful contrast of\r\ncolors belongs to the double star 14, but unfortunately the star is at\r\npresent very close, the distance between its sixth and seventh magnitude\r\ncomponents not exceeding 0.8\", position angle 64°. Sigma 958 is a pretty\r\ndouble, both stars being of the sixth magnitude, distance 5\", p. 257°.\r\nStill finer is Sigma 1009, a double, whose stars are both a little above\r\nthe seventh magnitude and nearly equal, distance 3\", p. 156°. A low\r\npower suffices to show the three stars in 19, their magnitudes being six\r\nand a half, seven and a half, and eight, distances 15\", p. 312°, and\r\n215\", p. 358°. Webb describes the two smaller stars as plum-colored.\r\nPlum-colored suns!\r\n\r\nAt the opposite end of the constellation are two fine doubles, Sigma\r\n1333, magnitudes six and a half and seven, distance 1.4\", p. 39°; and\r\n38, magnitudes four and seven, distance 2.9\", p. 235°.\r\n\r\nUnder the guidance of map No. 6 we turn to Leo, which contains one of\r\nthe leading gems among the double stars, gamma, whose components, of the\r\nsecond and fourth magnitudes, are respectively yellow and green, the\r\ngreen star, according to some observers, having a peculiar tinge of red.\r\nTheir distance apart is 3.7\", p. 118°, and they are undoubtedly in\r\nrevolution about a common center, the probable period being about four\r\nhundred years. The three-inch glass should separate them easily when the\r\nair is steady, and a pleasing sight they are.\r\n\r\nThe star iota is a closer double, and also very pretty, magnitudes four\r\nand eight, colors lemon and light blue, distance 2.17\", p. 53°. Other\r\ndoubles are tau, magnitudes five and seven, distance 95\", p. 170°; 88,\r\nmagnitudes seven and nine, distance 15\", p. 320°; 90, triple, magnitudes\r\nsix, seven and a half, and ten, distance, 3.5\", p. 209°, and 59\", p.\r\n234°; 54, magnitudes four and a half and seven, distance 6.2\", p. 102°;\r\nand 49, magnitudes six and nine, distance 2.4\", p. 158°.\r\n\r\nLeo contains a remarkable variable star, R, deep red in color, and\r\nvarying in a space of a hundred and forty-four days from the fifth to\r\nthe tenth magnitude. It has also several nebulæ, of which only one needs\r\nspecial mention, No. 1861. This is spindle-shaped, and large telescopes\r\nshow that it consists of three nebulæ. The observer with ordinary\r\ninstruments finds little to see and little to interest him in these\r\nsmall, faint nebulæ.\r\n\r\nWe may just glance at two double stars in the small constellation of\r\nSextans, situated under Leo. These are: 9, magnitudes seven and eight,\r\ndistance 53\", p. 292°; and 35, magnitudes six and seven, distance 6.9\",\r\np. 240°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 6.]\r\n\r\nComa Berenices (map No. 6) includes several interesting objects. Let\r\nus begin with the star 2, a double, of magnitudes six and seven and a\r\nhalf, distance 3.6\", p. 240°. The color of the smaller star is lilac.\r\nThis hue, although not extremely uncommon among double stars elsewhere,\r\nrecurs again and again, with singular persistence, in this little\r\nconstellation. For instance, in the very next star that we look at, 12,\r\nwe find a double whose smaller component is _lilac_. The magnitudes in\r\n12 are five and eight, distance 66\", p. 168°. So also the wide double\r\n17, magnitudes five and a half and six, distance 145\", exhibits a tinge\r\nof _lilac_ in the smaller component; the triple 35, magnitudes five,\r\neight, and nine, distances 1\", p. 77°, and 28.7\", p. 124°, has four\r\ncolors yellow, _lilac_, and blue, and the double 24, magnitudes five and\r\nsix, distance 20\", p. 270°, combines an orange with a _lilac_ star, a\r\nvery striking and beautiful contrast. We should make a mistake if we\r\nregarded this wonderful distribution of color among the double stars as\r\naccidental. It is manifestly expressive of their physical condition,\r\nalthough we can not yet decipher its exact meaning.\r\n\r\nThe binary 42 Comæ Berenicis is too close for ordinary telescopes, but\r\nit is highly interesting as an intermediate between those pairs which\r\nthe telescope is able to separate and those--like beta Aurigæ--which no\r\nmagnifying power can divide, but which reveal the fact that they are\r\ndouble by the periodical splitting of their spectral lines. The orbit in\r\n42 Comæ Berenicis is a very small one, so that even when the components\r\nare at their greatest distance apart they can not be separated by a\r\nfive-or six-inch glass. Burnham, using the Lick telescope, in 1890 made\r\nthe distance 0.7\"; Hall, using the Washington telescope, in 1891 made it\r\na trifle more than 0.5\". He had measured it in 1886 as only 0.27\". The\r\nperiod of revolution is believed to be about twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nIn Coma Berenices there is an outlying field of the marvelous nebulous\r\nregion of Virgo, which we may explore on some future evening. But the\r\nnebulæ in Coma are very faint, and, for an amateur, hardly worth the\r\ntrouble required to pick them up. The two clusters included in the map,\r\n2752 and 3453, are bright enough to repay inspection with our largest\r\naperture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 7.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Hydra is the largest constellation in the heavens, extending\r\nabout seven hours, or 105°, in right ascension, it contains\r\ncomparatively few objects of interest, and most of these are in the head\r\nor western end of the constellation, which we examined during our first\r\nnight at the telescope. In the central portion of Hydra, represented on\r\nmap No. 7, we find its leading star alpha, sometimes called Alphard, or\r\nCor Hydræ, a bright second-magnitude star that has been suspected of\r\nvariability. It has a decided orange tint, and is accompanied, at a\r\ndistance of 281\", p. 153°, by a greenish tenth-magnitude star. Bu. 339\r\nis a fine double, magnitudes eight and nine and a half, distance 1.3\",\r\np. 216°. The planetary nebula 2102 is about 1' in diameter, pale blue in\r\ncolor, and worth looking at, because it is brighter than most objects of\r\nits class. Tempel and Secchi have given wonderful descriptions of it,\r\nboth finding multitudes of stars intermingled with nebulous matter.\r\n\r\nFor a last glimpse at celestial splendors for the night, let us turn to\r\nthe rich cluster 1630, in Argo, just above the place where the stream of\r\nthe Milky Way--here bright in mid-channel and shallowing toward the\r\nshores--separates into two or three currents before disappearing behind\r\nthe horizon. It is by no means as brilliant as some of the star clusters\r\nwe have seen, but it gains in beauty and impressiveness from the\r\npresence of one bright star that seems to captain a host of inferior\r\nluminaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nVIRGO AND HER NEIGHBORS\r\n\r\n                     ... \"that region\r\nWhere still by night is seen\r\nThe Virgin goddess near to bright Boötes.\"--POSTE'S ARATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 8.]\r\n\r\nFollowing the order of right ascension, we come next to the little\r\nconstellations Crater and Corvus, which may be described as standing on\r\nthe curves of Hydra (map No. 8). Beginning with Crater, let us look\r\nfirst at alpha, a yellow fourth-magnitude star, near which is a\r\ncelebrated red variable R. With a low power we can see both alpha and R\r\nin the same field of view, like a very wide double. There is a third\r\nstar of ninth magnitude, and bluish in color, near R on the side toward\r\nalpha. R is variable both in color and light. When reddest, it has been\r\ndescribed as \"scarlet,\" \"crimson,\" and \"blood-colored\"; when palest, it\r\nis a deep orange-red. Its light variation has a period the precise\r\nlength of which is not yet known. The cycle of change is included\r\nbetween the eighth and ninth magnitudes.\r\n\r\nWhile our three-inch telescope suffices to show R, it is better to use\r\nthe five-inch, because of the faintness of the star. When the color is\r\nwell seen, the contrast with alpha is very pleasing.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly anything else in Crater to interest us, and we pass over\r\nthe border into Corvus, and go at once to its chief attraction, the star\r\ndelta. The components of this beautiful double are of magnitudes three\r\nand eight; distance 24\", p. 211°; colors yellow and purple.\r\n\r\nThe night being dark and clear, we take the five-inch and turn it on the\r\nnebula 3128, which the map shows just under the border of Corvus in the\r\nedge of Hydra. Herschel believed he had resolved this into stars. It is\r\na faint object and small, not exceeding one eighth of the moon's\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nFarther east in Hydra, as indicated near the left-hand edge of map No.\r\n8, is a somewhat remarkable variable, R Hydræ. This star occasionally\r\nreaches magnitude three and a half, while at minimum it is not much\r\nabove the tenth magnitude. Its period is about four hundred and\r\ntwenty-five days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 9.]\r\n\r\nWhile we have been examining these comparatively barren regions, glad to\r\nfind one or two colored doubles to relieve the monotony of the search, a\r\nglittering white star has frequently drawn our eyes eastward and upward.\r\nIt is Spica, the great gem of Virgo, and, yielding to its attraction, we\r\nnow enter the richer constellation over which it presides (map No. 9).\r\nExcept for its beauty, which every one must admire, Spica, or alpha\r\nVirginis, has no special claim upon our attention. Some evidence has\r\nbeen obtained that, like beta Aurigæ and Capella, it revolves with an\r\ninvisible companion of great mass in an orbit only six million miles in\r\ndiameter. Spica's spectrum resembles that of Sirius. The faint star\r\nwhich our larger apertures show about 6' northeast of Spica is of the\r\ntenth magnitude.\r\n\r\nSweeping westward, we come upon Sigma 1669, a pretty little double with\r\nnearly equal components of about the sixth magnitude, distance 5.6\", p.\r\n124°. But our interest is not fully aroused until we reach gamma, a star\r\nwith a history. The components of this celebrated binary are both\r\nnearly of the third magnitude, distance about 5.8\", p. 150°. They\r\nrevolve around their common center in something less than two hundred\r\nyears. According to some authorities, the period is one hundred and\r\nseventy years, but it is not yet certainly ascertained. It was noticed\r\nabout the beginning of the seventeenth century that gamma Virginis was\r\ndouble. In 1836 the stars were so close together that no telescope then\r\nin existence was able to separate them, although it is said that the\r\ndisk into which they had merged was elongated at Pulkowa. In a few years\r\nthey became easily separable once more. If the\r\none-hundred-and-seventy-year period is correct, they should continue to\r\nget farther apart until about 1921. According to Asaph Hall, their\r\ngreatest apparent distance is 6.3\", and their least apparent distance\r\n0.5\"; consequently, they will never again close up beyond the separating\r\npower of existing telescopes.\r\n\r\nThere is a great charm in watching this pair of stars even with a\r\nthree-inch telescope--not so much on account of what is seen, although\r\nthey are very beautiful, as on account of what we know they are doing.\r\nIt is no slight thing to behold two distant stars obeying the law that\r\nmakes a stone fall to the ground and compels the earth to swing round\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nIn theta we discover a fine triple, magnitudes four and a half, nine,\r\nand ten; distances 7\", p. 345°, and 65\", p. 295°. The ninth-magnitude\r\nstar has been described as \"violet,\" but such designations of color are\r\noften misleading when the star is very faint. On the other hand it\r\nshould not be assumed that a certain color does not exist because the\r\nobserver can not perceive it, for experience shows that there is a wide\r\ndifference among observers in the power of the eye to distinguish color.\r\nI have known persons who could not perceive the difference of hue in\r\nsome of the most beautifully contrasted colored doubles to be found in\r\nthe sky. I am acquainted with an astronomer of long experience in the\r\nuse of telescopes, whose eye is so deficient in color sense that he\r\ndenies that there are any decided colors among the stars. Such persons\r\nmiss one of the finest pleasures of the telescope. In examining theta\r\nVirginis we shall do best to use our largest aperture, viz., the\r\nfive-inch. Yet Webb records that all three of the stars in this triple\r\nhave been seen with a telescope of only three inches aperture. The\r\namateur must remember in such cases how much depends upon practice as\r\nwell as upon the condition of the atmosphere. There are lamentably few\r\nnights in a year when even the best telescope is ideally perfect in\r\nperformance, but every night's observation increases the capacity of the\r\neye, begetting a kind of critical judgment which renders it to some\r\nextent independent of atmospheric vagaries. It will also be found that\r\nthe idiosyncrasies of the observer are reflected in his instrument,\r\nwhich seems to have its fits of excellence, its inspirations so to\r\nspeak, while at other times it behaves as if all its wonderful powers\r\nhad departed.\r\n\r\nAnother double that perhaps we had better not try with less than four\r\ninches aperture is 84 Virginis. The magnitudes are six and nine;\r\ndistance, 3.5\", p. 233°. Colors yellow and blue. Sigma 1846 is a\r\nfifth-magnitude star with a tenth-magnitude companion, distance only 4\",\r\np. 108°. Use the five-inch.\r\n\r\nAnd now we approach something that is truly marvelous, the \"Field of the\r\nNebulæ.\" This strange region, lying mostly in the constellation Virgo,\r\nis roughly outlined by the stars beta, eta, gamma, delta, and epsilon,\r\nwhich form two sides of a square some 15° across. It extends, however,\r\nfor some distance into Coma Berenices, while outlying nebulæ belonging\r\nto it are also to be found in the eastern part of Leo. Unfortunately\r\nfor those who expect only brilliant revelations when they look through a\r\ntelescope, this throng of nebulæ consists of small and inconspicuous\r\nwisps as ill defined as bits of thistle-down floating high in the air.\r\nThere are more than three hundred of them all told, but even the\r\nbrightest are faint objects when seen with the largest of our\r\ntelescopes. Why do they congregate thus? That is the question which\r\nlends an interest to the assemblage that no individual member of it\r\ncould alone command. It is a mystery, but beyond question it is\r\nexplicable. The explanation, however, is yet to be discovered.\r\n\r\nThe places of only three of the nebulæ are indicated on the map. No.\r\n2806 has been described as resembling in shape a shuttle. Its length is\r\nnearly one third of the moon's diameter. It is brightest near the\r\ncenter, and has several faint companions. No. 2961 is round, 4' in\r\ndiameter, and is accompanied by another round nebula in the same field\r\nof view toward the south. No. 3105 is double, and powerful telescopes\r\nshow two more ghostly companions. There is an opportunity for good and\r\nuseful work in a careful study of the little nebulæ that swim into view\r\nall over this part of Virgo. Celestial photography has triumphs in store\r\nfor itself here.\r\n\r\nScattered over and around the region where the nebulæ are thickest we\r\nfind eight or nine variable stars, three of the most remarkable of\r\nwhich, R, S, and U, may be found on the map. R is very irregular,\r\nsometimes attaining magnitude six and a half, while at other times its\r\nmaximum brightness does not exceed that of an eighth-magnitude star. At\r\nminimum it sinks to the tenth or eleventh magnitude. Its period is one\r\nhundred and forty-five days. U varies from magnitude seven or eight down\r\nto magnitude twelve or under and then regains its light, in a period of\r\nabout two hundred and seven days. S is interesting for its brilliant red\r\ncolor. When brightest, it exceeds the sixth magnitude, but at some of\r\nits maxima the magnitude is hardly greater than the eighth. At minimum\r\nit goes below the twelfth magnitude. Period, three hundred and\r\nseventy-six days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 10.]\r\n\r\nNext east of Virgo is Libra, which contains a few notable objects (map\r\nNo. 10). The star alpha has a fifth-magnitude companion, distant about\r\n230\", which can be easily seen with an opera glass. At the point marked\r\nA on the map is a curious multiple star, sometimes referred to by its\r\nnumber in Piazzi's catalogues as follows: 212 P. xiv. The two principal\r\nstars are easily seen, their magnitudes being six and seven and a half;\r\ndistance 15\", p. 290°. Burnham found four other faint companions, for\r\nwhich it would be useless for us to look. The remarkable thing is that\r\nthese faint stars, the nearest of which is distant about 50\" from the\r\nlargest member of the group and the farthest about 129\", do not share,\r\naccording to their discoverer, in the rapid proper motion of the two\r\nmain stars.\r\n\r\nIn iota we find a double a little difficult for our three-inch. The\r\ncomponents are of magnitudes four and a half and nine, distance 57\", p.\r\n110°. Burnham discovered that the ninth-magnitude star consists of two\r\nof the tenth less than 2\" apart, p. 24°.\r\n\r\nNo astronomer who happens to be engaged in this part of the sky ever\r\nfails, unless his attention is absorbed by something of special\r\ninterest, to glance at beta Libræ, which is famous as the only naked-eye\r\nstar having a decided green color. The hue is pale, but manifest.[3]\r\n\r\n[3] Is the slight green tint perceptible in Sirius variable? I am\r\nsometimes disposed to think it is.\r\n\r\nThe star is a remarkable variable, belonging to what is called the Algol\r\ntype. Its period, according to Chandler, is 2 days 7 hours, 51\r\nminutes, 22.8 seconds. The time occupied by the actual changes is about\r\ntwelve hours. At maximum the star is of magnitude five and at minimum of\r\nmagnitude 6.2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 11.]\r\n\r\nWe may now conveniently turn northward from Virgo in order to explore\r\nBoötes, one of the most interesting of the constellations (map No. 11).\r\nIts leading star alpha, Arcturus, is the brightest in the northern\r\nhemisphere. Its precedence over its rivals Vega and Capella, long in\r\ndispute, has been settled by the Harvard photometry. You notice that the\r\ncolor of Arcturus, when it has not risen far above the horizon, is a\r\nyellowish red, but when the star is near mid-heaven the color fades to\r\nlight yellow. The hue is possibly variable, for it is recorded that in\r\n1852 Arcturus appeared to have nearly lost its color. If it should\r\neventually turn white, the fact would have an important bearing upon the\r\nquestion whether Sirius was, as alleged, once a red or flame-colored\r\nstar.\r\n\r\nBut let us sit here in the starlight, for the night is balmy, and talk\r\nabout Arcturus, which is perhaps actually the greatest sun within the\r\nrange of terrestrial vision. Its parallax is so minute that the\r\nconsideration of the tremendous size of this star is a thing that the\r\nimagination can not placidly approach. Calculations, based on its\r\nassumed distance, which show that it _outshines the sun several thousand\r\ntimes_, may be no exaggeration of the truth! It is easy to make such a\r\ncalculation. One of Dr. Elkin's parallaxes for Arcturus is 0.018\". That\r\nis to say, the displacement of Arcturus due to the change in the\r\nobserver's point of view when he looks at the star first from one side\r\nand then from the other side of the earth's orbit, 186,000,000 miles\r\nacross, amounts to only eighteen one-thousandths of a second of arc. We\r\ncan appreciate how small that is when we reflect that it is about equal\r\nto the apparent distance between the heads of two pins placed an inch\r\napart and viewed from a distance of a hundred and eighty miles!\r\n\r\nAssuming this estimate of the parallax of Arcturus, let us see how it\r\nwill enable us to calculate the probable size or light-giving power of\r\nthe star as compared with the sun. The first thing to do is to multiply\r\nthe earth's distance from the sun, which may be taken at 93,000,000\r\nmiles, by 206,265, the number of seconds of arc in a radian, the base of\r\ncircular measure, and then divide the product by the parallax of the\r\nstar. Performing the multiplication and division, we get the following:\r\n\r\n19,182,645,000,000 / .018 = 1,065,702,500,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe quotient represents miles! Call it, in round numbers, a thousand\r\nmillions of millions of miles. This is about 11,400,000 times the\r\ndistance from the earth to the sun.\r\n\r\nNow for the second part of the calculation: The amount of light received\r\non the earth from some of the brighter stars has been experimentally\r\ncompared with the amount received from the sun. The results differ\r\nrather widely, but in the case of Arcturus the ratio of the star's light\r\nto sunlight may be taken as about one twenty-five-thousand-millionth--i.\r\ne., 25,000,000,000 stars, each equal to Arcturus, would together shed\r\nupon the earth as much light as the sun does. But we know that light\r\nvaries inversely as the square of the distance; for instance, if the sun\r\nwere twice as far away as it is, its light would be diminished for us to\r\na quarter of its present amount. Suppose, then, that we could remove the\r\nearth to a point midway between the sun and Arcturus, we should then be\r\n5,700,000 times as far from the sun as we now are. In order to estimate\r\nhow much light the sun would send us from that distance we must square\r\nthe number 5,700,000 and then take the result inversely, or as a\r\nfraction. We thus get 1 / 32,490,000,000,000, representing the ratio of\r\nthe sun's light at half the distance of Arcturus to that at its real\r\ndistance. But while receding from the sun we should be approaching\r\nArcturus. We should get, in fact, twice as near to that star as we were\r\nbefore, and therefore its light would be increased for us fourfold. Now,\r\nif the amount of sunlight had not changed, it would exceed the light of\r\nArcturus only a quarter as much as it did before, or in the ratio of\r\n25,000,000,000 / 4 = 6,250,000,000 to 1. But, as we have seen, the\r\nsunlight would diminish through increase of distance to one\r\n32,490,000,000,000th part of its original amount. Hence its altered\r\nratio to the light of Arcturus would become 6,250,000,000 to\r\n32,490,000,000,000, or 1 to 5,198.\r\n\r\nThis means that if the earth were situated midway between the sun and\r\nArcturus, it would receive 5,198 times as much light from that star as\r\nit would from the sun! It is quite probable, moreover, that the heat of\r\nArcturus exceeds the solar heat in the same ratio, for the spectroscope\r\nshows that although Arcturus is surrounded with a cloak of metallic\r\nvapors proportionately far more extensive than the sun's, yet, smothered\r\nas the great star seems in some respects to be, it rivals Sirius itself\r\nin the intensity of its radiant energy.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose the radiation of Arcturus to be the same per unit of\r\nsurface as the sun's, it follows that Arcturus exceeds the sun about\r\n375,000 times in volume, and that its diameter is no less than\r\n62,350,000 miles! Imagine the earth and the other planets constituting\r\nthe solar system removed to Arcturus and set revolving around it in\r\norbits of the same forms and sizes as those in which they circle about\r\nthe sun. Poor Mercury! For that little planet it would indeed be a jump\r\nfrom the frying pan into the fire, because, as it rushed to perihelion,\r\nMercury would plunge more than 2,500,000 miles beneath the surface of\r\nthe giant star. Venus and the earth would melt like snowflakes at the\r\nmouth of a furnace. Even far-away Neptune, the remotest member of the\r\nsystem, would swelter in torrid heat.\r\n\r\nBut stop! Look at the sky. Observe how small and motionless the disks of\r\nthe stars have become. Back to the telescopes at once, for this is a\r\ntoken that the atmosphere is steady, and that \"good seeing\" may be\r\nexpected. It is fortunate, for we have some delicate work before us. The\r\nvery first double star we try in Boötes, Sigma 1772, requires the use of\r\nthe four-inch, and the five-inch shows it more satisfactorily. The\r\nmagnitudes are sixth and ninth, distance 5\", p. 140°. On the other side\r\nof Arcturus we find zeta, a star that we should have had no great\r\ndifficulty in separating thirty years ago, but which has now closed up\r\nbeyond the reach even of our five-inch. The magnitudes are both fourth,\r\nand the distance less than a quarter of a second; position angle\r\nchanging. It is apparently a binary, and if so will some time widen\r\nagain, but its period is unknown. The star 279, also known as Sigma\r\n1910, near the southeastern edge of the constellation, is a pretty\r\ndouble, each component being of the seventh magnitude, distance 4\", p.\r\n212°. Just above zeta we come upon pi, an easy double for the\r\nthree-inch, magnitudes four and six, distance 6\" p. 99°. Next is xi, a\r\nyellow and purple pair, whose magnitudes are respectively five and\r\nseven, distance less than 3\", p. 200°. This is undoubtedly a binary with\r\na period of revolution of about a hundred and thirty years. Its distance\r\ndecreased about 1\" between 1881 and 1891. It was still decreasing in\r\n1899, when it had become 2.5\". The orbital swing is also very apparent\r\nin the change of the position angle.\r\n\r\nThe telescopic gem of Boötes, and one of \"the flowers of the sky,\" is\r\nepsilon, also known as Mirac. When well seen, as we shall see it\r\nto-night, epsilon Boötis is superb. The magnitudes of its two component\r\nstars are two and a half (according to Hall, three) and six. The\r\ndistance is about 2.8\", p. 326°. The contrast of colors--bright orange\r\nyellow, set against brilliant emerald green--is magnificent. There are\r\nvery few doubles that can be compared with it in this respect. The\r\nthree-inch will separate it, but the five-inch enables us best to enjoy\r\nits beauty. It appears to be a binary, but the motion is very slow, and\r\nnothing certain is yet known of its period.\r\n\r\nIn delta we have a very wide and easy double; magnitudes three and a\r\nhalf and eight and a half, distance 110\", p. 75°. The smaller star has a\r\nlilac hue. We can not hope with any of our instruments to see all of the\r\nthree stars contained in , but two of them are easily seen; magnitudes\r\nfour and seven, distance 108\", p. 172°. The smaller star is again\r\ndouble; magnitudes seven and eight, distance 0.77\", p. 88°. It is\r\nclearly a binary, with a long period. A six-inch telescope that could\r\nseparate this star at present would be indeed a treasure. Sigma 1926 is\r\nanother object rather beyond our powers, on account of the contrast of\r\nmagnitudes. These are six and eight and a half; distance 1.3\", p. 256°.\r\n\r\nOther doubles are: 44 (Sigma 1909), magnitudes five and six, distance\r\n4.8\", p. 240°; 39 (Sigma 1890), magnitudes both nearly six, distance\r\n3.6\", p. 45°. Smaller star light red; iota, magnitudes four and a half\r\nand seven and a half, distance 38\", p. 33°; kappa, magnitudes five and a\r\nhalf and eight, distance 12.7\", p. 238°. Some observers see a greenish\r\ntinge in the light of the larger star, the smaller one being blue.\r\n\r\nThere are one or two interesting things to be seen in that part of Canes\r\nVenatici which is represented on map No. 11. The first of these is the\r\nstar cluster 3936. This will reward a good look with the five-inch. With\r\nlarge telescopes as many as one thousand stars have been discerned\r\npacked within its globular outlines.\r\n\r\nThe star 25 (Sigma 1768) is a close binary with a period estimated at\r\none hundred and twenty-five years. The magnitudes are six and seven or\r\neight, distance about 1\", p. 137°. We may try for this with the\r\nfive-inch, and if we do not succeed in separating the stars we may hope\r\nto do so some time, for the distance between them is increasing.\r\n\r\nAlthough the nebula 3572 is a very wonderful object, we shall leave it\r\nfor another evening.\r\n\r\nEastward from Boötes shines the circlet of Corona Borealis, whose form\r\nis so strikingly marked out by the stars that the most careless eye\r\nperceives it at once. Although a very small constellation, it abounds\r\nwith interesting objects. We begin our attack with the five-inch on\r\nSigma 1932, but not too confident that we shall come off victors, for\r\nthis binary has been slowly closing for many years. The magnitudes are\r\nsix and a half and seven, distance 0.84\", p. 150°. Not far distant is\r\nanother binary, at present beyond our powers, eta. Here the magnitudes\r\nare both six, distance 0.65\", p. 3°. Hall assigns a period of forty\r\nyears to this star.\r\n\r\nThe assemblage of close binaries in this neighborhood is very curious.\r\nOnly a few degrees away we find one that is still more remarkable, the\r\nstar gamma. What has previously been said about 42 Comæ Berenicis\r\napplies in a measure to this star also. It, too, has a comparatively\r\nsmall orbit, and its components are never seen widely separated. In 1826\r\ntheir distance was 0.7\"; in 1880 they could not be split; in 1891 the\r\ndistance had increased to 0.36\", and in 1894 it had become 0.53\", p.\r\n123°. But in 1899 Lewis made the distance only 0.43\". The period has\r\nbeen estimated at one hundred years.\r\n\r\nWhile the group of double stars in the southern part of Corona Borealis\r\nconsists, as we have seen, of remarkably close binaries, another group\r\nin the northern part of the same constellation comprises stars that are\r\neasily separated. Let us first try zeta. The powers of the three-inch\r\nare amply sufficient in this case. The magnitudes are four and five,\r\ndistance 6.3\", p. 300°. Colors, white or bluish-white and blue or green.\r\n\r\nNext take sigma, whose magnitudes are five and six, distance 4\", p.\r\n206°. With the five-inch we may look for a second companion of the tenth\r\nmagnitude, distance 54\", p. 88°. It is thought highly probable that\r\nsigma is a binary, but its period has simply been guessed at.\r\n\r\nFinally, we come to nu, which consists of two very widely separated\r\nstars, nu^1 and nu^2, each of which has a faint companion. With the\r\nfive-inch we may be able to see the companion of nu^2, the more\r\nsoutherly of the pair. The magnitude of the companion is variously given\r\nas tenth and twelfth, distance 137\", p. 18°.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of the map we find the position of the new star of 1866,\r\nwhich is famous as the first so-called temporary star to which\r\nspectroscopic analysis was applied. When first noticed, on May 12, 1866,\r\nthis star was of the second magnitude, fully equaling in brilliancy\r\nalpha, the brightest star of the constellation; but in about two weeks\r\nit fell to the ninth magnitude. Huggins and Miller eagerly studied the\r\nstar with the spectroscope, and their results were received with deepest\r\ninterest. They concluded that the light of the new star had two\r\ndifferent sources, each giving a spectrum peculiar to itself. One of the\r\nspectra had dark lines and the other bright lines. It will be\r\nremembered that a similar peculiarity was exhibited by the new star in\r\nAuriga in 1893. But the star in Corona did not disappear. It diminished\r\nto magnitude nine and a half or ten, and stopped there; and it is still\r\nvisible. In fact, subsequent examination proved that it had been\r\ncatalogued at Bonn as a star of magnitude nine and a half in 1855.\r\nConsequently this \"blaze star\" of 1866 will bear watching in its\r\ndecrepitude. Nobody knows but that it may blaze again. Perhaps it is a\r\nsun-like body; perhaps it bears little resemblance to a sun as we\r\nunderstand such a thing. But whatever it may be, it has proved itself\r\ncapable of doing very extraordinary things.\r\n\r\nWe have no reason to suspect the sun of any latent eccentricities, like\r\nthose that have been displayed by \"temporary\" stars; yet, acting on the\r\nprinciple which led the old emperor-astrologer Rudolph II to torment his\r\nmind with self-made horoscopes of evil import, let us unscientifically\r\nimagine that the sun _could_ suddenly burst out with several hundred\r\ntimes its ordinary amount of heat and light, thereby putting us into a\r\nproper condition for spectroscopic examination by curious astronomers in\r\ndistant worlds.\r\n\r\nBut no, after all, it is far pleasanter to keep within the strict\r\nboundaries of science, and not imagine anything of the kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nIN SUMMER STAR-LANDS\r\n\r\n\"I heard the trailing garments of the night\r\n  Sweep through her marble halls,\r\nI saw her sable skirts all fringed with light\r\n  From the celestial walls.\"--H. W. LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the soft air of a summer night, when fireflies are flashing their\r\nlanterns over the fields, the stars do not sparkle and blaze like those\r\nthat pierce the frosty skies of winter. The light of Sirius, Aldebaran,\r\nRigel, and other midwinter brilliants possesses a certain gemlike\r\nhardness and cutting quality, but Antares and Vega, the great summer\r\nstars, and Arcturus, when he hangs westering in a July night, exhibit a\r\nmilder radiance, harmonizing with the character of the season. This\r\ndifference is, of course, atmospheric in origin, although it may be\r\npartly subjective, depending upon the mental influences of the mutations\r\nof Nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 12.]\r\n\r\nThe constellation Scorpio is nearly as striking in outline as Orion, and\r\nits brightest star, the red Antares (alpha in map No. 12), carries\r\nconcealed in its rays a green jewel which, to the eye of the enthusiast\r\nin telescopic recreation, appears more beautiful and inviting each time\r\nthat he penetrates to its hiding place.\r\n\r\nWe shall begin our night's work with this object, and the four-inch\r\nglass will serve our purpose, although the untrained observer would be\r\nmore certain of success with the five-inch. A friend of mine has seen\r\nthe companion of Antares with a three-inch, but I have never tried the\r\nstar with so small an aperture. When the air is steady and the companion\r\ncan be well viewed, there is no finer sight among the double stars. The\r\ncontrast of colors is beautifully distinct--fire-red and bright green.\r\nThe little green star has been seen emerging from behind the moon, ahead\r\nof its ruddy companion. The magnitudes are one and seven and a half or\r\neight, distance 3\", p. 270°. Antares is probably a binary, although its\r\nbinary character has not yet been established.\r\n\r\nA slight turn of the telescope tube brings us to the star sigma, a wide\r\ndouble, the smaller component of which is blue or plum-colored;\r\nmagnitudes four and nine, distance 20\", p. 272°. From sigma we pass to\r\nbeta, a very beautiful object, of which the three-inch gives us a\r\nsplendid view. Its two components are of magnitudes two and six,\r\ndistance 13\", p. 30°; colors, white and bluish. It is interesting to\r\nknow that the larger star is itself double, although none of the\r\ntelescopes we are using can split it. Burnham discovered that it has a\r\ntenth-magnitude companion; distance less than 1\", p. 87°.\r\n\r\nAnd now for a triple, which will probably require the use of our largest\r\nglass. Up near the end of the northern prolongation of the constellation\r\nwe perceive the star xi. The three-inch shows us that it is double; the\r\nfive-inch divides the larger star again. The magnitudes are respectively\r\nfive, five and a half, and seven and a half, distances 0.94\", p. 215°,\r\nand 7\", p. 70°.\r\n\r\nA still more remarkable star, although one of its components is beyond\r\nour reach, is nu. With the slightest magnifying this object splits up\r\ninto two stars, of magnitudes four and seven, situated rather more than\r\n40\" apart. A high power divides the seventh-magnitude companion into\r\ntwo, each of magnitude six and a half, distance 1.8\", p. 42°. But (and\r\nthis was another of Burnham's discoveries) the fourth-magnitude star\r\nitself is double, distance 0.8\", p. about 0°. The companion in this case\r\nis of magnitude five and a half.\r\n\r\nNext we shall need a rather low-power eyepiece and our largest aperture\r\nin order to examine a star cluster, No. 4173, which was especially\r\nadmired by Sir William Herschel, who discovered that it was not, as\r\nMessier had supposed, a circular nebula. Herschel regarded it as the\r\nrichest mass of stars in the firmament, but with a small telescope it\r\nappears merely as a filmy speck that has sometimes been mistaken for a\r\ncomet. In 1860 a new star, between the sixth and seventh magnitude in\r\nbrilliance, suddenly appeared directly in or upon the cluster, and the\r\nfeeble radiance of the latter was almost extinguished by the superior\r\nlight of the stranger. The latter disappeared in less than a month, and\r\nhas not been seen again, although it is suspected to be a variable, and,\r\nas such, has been designated with the letter T. Two other known\r\nvariables, both very faint, exist in the immediate neighborhood.\r\nAccording to the opinion that was formerly looked upon with favor, the\r\nvariable T, if it is a variable, simply lies in the line of sight\r\nbetween the earth and the star cluster, and has no actual connection\r\nwith the latter. But this opinion may not, after all, be correct, for\r\nMr. Bailey's observations show that variable stars sometimes exist in\r\nlarge numbers in clusters, although the variables thus observed are of\r\nshort period. The cluster 4183, just west of Antares, is also worth a\r\nglance with the five-inch glass. It is dense, but its stars are very\r\nsmall, so that to enjoy its beauty we should have to employ a large\r\ntelescope. Yet there is a certain attraction in these far-away glimpses\r\nof starry swarms, for they give us some perception of the awful\r\nprofundity of space. When the mind is rightly attuned for these\r\nrevelations of the telescope, there are no words that can express its\r\nimpressions of the overwhelming perspective of the universe.\r\n\r\nThe southern part of the constellation Ophiuchus is almost inextricably\r\nmingled with Scorpio. We shall, therefore, look next at its attractions,\r\nbeginning with the remarkable array of star clusters 4264, 4268, 4269,\r\nand 4270. All of these are small, 2' or 3' in diameter, and globular in\r\nshape. No. 4264 is the largest, and we can see some of the stars\r\ncomposing it. But these clusters, like those just described in Scorpio,\r\nare more interesting for what they signify than for what they show; and\r\nthe interest is not diminished by the fact that their meaning is more or\r\nless of a mystery. Whether they are composed of pygmy suns or of great\r\nsolar globes like that one which makes daylight for the earth, their\r\nassociation in spherical groups is equally suggestive.\r\n\r\nThere are two other star clusters in Ophiuchus, and within the limits of\r\nmap No. 12, both of which are more extensive than those we have just\r\nbeen looking at. No. 4211 is 5' or 6' in diameter, also globular,\r\nbrighter at the center, and surrounded by several comparatively\r\nconspicuous stars. No. 4346 is still larger, about half as broad as the\r\nmoon, and many of its scattered stars are of not less than the ninth\r\nmagnitude. With a low magnifying power the field of view surrounding the\r\ncluster appears powdered with stars.\r\n\r\nThere are only two noteworthy doubles in that part of Ophiuchus with\r\nwhich we are at present concerned: 36, whose magnitudes are five and\r\nseven, distance 4.3\", p. 195°, colors yellow and red; and 39, magnitudes\r\nsix and seven and a half, distance 12\", p. 356°, colors yellow or\r\norange and blue. The first named is a binary whose period has not been\r\ndefinitely ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe variable R has a period a little less than three hundred and three\r\ndays. At its brightest it is of magnitude seven or eight, and at minimum\r\nit diminishes to about the twelfth magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe spot where the new star of 1604 appeared is indicated on the map.\r\nThis was, with the exception of Tycho's star in 1572, the brightest\r\ntemporary star of which we possess a trustworthy account. It is\r\nfrequently referred to as Kepler's star, because Kepler watched it with\r\nconsiderable attention, but unfortunately he was not as good an observer\r\nas Tycho was. The star was first seen on October 10, 1604, and was then\r\nbrighter than Jupiter. It did not, however, equal Venus. It gradually\r\nfaded and in March, 1606, disappeared. About twelve degrees northwest of\r\nthe place of the star of 1604, and in that part of the constellation\r\nSerpens which is included in map No. 12, we find the location of another\r\ntemporary star, that of 1848. It was first noticed by Mr. Hind on April\r\n28th of that year, when its magnitude was not much above the seventh,\r\nand its color was red. It brightened rapidly, until on May 2d it was of\r\nmagnitude three and a half. Then it began to fade, but very slowly, and\r\nit has never entirely disappeared. It is now of the twelfth or\r\nthirteenth magnitude.\r\n\r\nIn passing we may glance with a low power at nu Serpentis, a wide\r\ndouble, magnitudes four and nine, distance 50\", p. 31°, colors\r\ncontrasted but uncertain.\r\n\r\nSagittarius and its neighbor, the small but rich constellation Scutum\r\nSobieskii, attract us next. We shall first deal with the western\r\nportions of these constellations which are represented on Map No. 12.\r\nThe star in Sagittarius is a wide triple, magnitudes three and a half,\r\nnine and a half, and ten, distances 40\", p. 315°, and 45\", p. 114°. But\r\nthe chief glory of Sagittarius (and the same statement applies to Scutum\r\nSobieskii) lies in its assemblage of star clusters. One of these, No.\r\n4361, also known as M 8, is plainly visible to the naked eye as a bright\r\nspot in the Milky Way. We turn our five-inch telescope, armed with a low\r\nmagnifying power, upon this subject and enjoy a rare spectacle. As we\r\nallow it to drift through the field we see a group of three\r\ncomparatively brilliant stars advancing at the front of a wonderful\r\ntrain of mingled star clusters and nebulous clouds. A little northwest\r\nof it appears the celebrated trifid nebula, No. 4355 on the map. There\r\nis some evidence that changes have occurred in this nebula since its\r\ndiscovery in the last century. Barnard has made a beautiful photograph\r\nshowing M 8 and the trifid nebula on the same plate, and he remarks that\r\nthe former is a far more remarkable object than its more famous\r\nneighbor. Near the eastern border of the principal nebulous cloud there\r\nis a small and very black hole with a star poised on its eastern edge.\r\nThis hole and the star are clearly shown in the photograph.\r\n\r\nCluster No. 4397 (M 24) is usually described as resembling, to the naked\r\neye, a protuberance on the edge of the Milky Way. It is nearly three\r\ntimes as broad as the moon, and is very rich in minute stars, which are\r\nat just such a degree of visibility that crowds of them continually\r\nappear and disappear while the eye wanders over the field, just as faces\r\nare seen and lost in a vast assemblage of people. This kind of luminous\r\nagitation is not peculiar to M 24, although that cluster exhibits it\r\nbetter than most others do on account of both the multitude and the\r\nminuteness of its stars.\r\n\r\nA slight sweep eastward brings us to yet another meeting place of stars,\r\nthe cluster M 25, situated between the variables U and V. This is\r\nbrilliant and easily resolved into its components, which include a\r\nnumber of double stars.\r\n\r\nThe two neighboring variables just referred to are interesting. U has a\r\nperiod of about six days and three quarters, and its range of magnitude\r\nruns from the seventh down to below the eighth. V is a somewhat\r\nmysterious star. Chandler removed it from his catalogue of variables\r\nbecause no change had been observed in its light by either himself,\r\nSawyer, or Yendell. Quirling, the discoverer of its variability, gave\r\nthe range as between magnitudes 7.6 and 8.8. It must, therefore, be\r\nexceedingly erratic in its changes, resembling rather the temporary\r\nstars than the true variables.\r\n\r\nIn that part of Scutum Sobieskii contained in map No. 12 we find an\r\ninteresting double, Sigma 2325, whose magnitudes are six and nine,\r\ndistance 12.3\", p. 260°, colors white and orange. Sigma 2306 is a\r\ntriple, magnitudes seven, eight, and nine, distances 12\", p. 220°, and\r\n0.8\", p. 68°. The third star is, however, beyond our reach. The colors\r\nof the two larger are respectively yellow and violet.\r\n\r\nThe star cluster 4400 is about one quarter as broad as the moon, and\r\neasily seen with our smallest aperture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 13.]\r\n\r\nPassing near to the region covered by map No. 13, we find the remaining\r\nportions of the constellations Sagittarius and Scutum Sobieskii. It will\r\nbe advisable to finish with the latter first. Glance at the clusters\r\n4426 and 4437. Neither is large, but both are rich in stars. The nebula\r\n4441 is a fine object of its kind. It brightens toward the center, and\r\nHerschel thought he had resolved it into stars. The variable R is\r\nremarkable for its eccentricities. Sometimes it attains nearly the\r\nfourth magnitude, although usually at maximum it is below the fifth,\r\nwhile at minimum it is occasionally of the sixth and at other times of\r\nthe seventh or eighth magnitude. Its period is irregular.\r\n\r\nTurning back to Sagittarius, we resume our search for interesting\r\nobjects there, and the first that we discover is another star cluster,\r\nfor the stars are wonderfully gregarious in this quarter of the heavens.\r\nThe number our cluster bears on the map is 4424, corresponding with M 22\r\nin Messier's catalogue. It is very bright, containing many stars of the\r\ntenth and eleventh magnitudes, as well as a swarm of smaller ones. Sir\r\nJohn Herschel regarded the larger stars in this cluster as possessing a\r\nreddish tint. Possibly there was some peculiarity in his eye that gave\r\nhim this impression, for he has described a cluster in the constellation\r\nToucan in the southern hemisphere as containing a globular mass of\r\nrose-colored stars inclosed in a spherical shell of white stars. Later\r\nobservers have confirmed his description of the shape and richness of\r\nthis cluster in Toucan, but have been unable to perceive the red hue of\r\nthe interior stars.\r\n\r\nThe eastern expanse of Sagittarius is a poor region compared with the\r\nwestern end of the constellation, where the wide stream of the Milky Way\r\nlike a great river enriches its surroundings. The variables T and R are\r\nof little interest to us, for they never become bright enough to be seen\r\nwithout the aid of a telescope. In 54 we find, however, an interesting\r\ndouble, which with larger telescopes than any of ours appears as a\r\ntriple. The two stars that we see are of magnitudes six and seven and a\r\nhalf, distance 45\", p. 42°, colors yellow and blue. The third star,\r\nperhaps of thirteenth magnitude, is distant 36\", p. 245°.\r\n\r\nRetaining map No. 13 as our guide, we examine the western part of the\r\nconstellation Capricornus. Its leader alpha is a naked-eye double, the\r\ntwo stars being a little more than 6' apart. Their magnitudes are three\r\nand four, and both have a yellowish hue. The western star is alpha^1,\r\nand is the fainter of the two. The other is designated as alpha^2. Both\r\nare double. The components of alpha^1 are of magnitudes four and eight\r\nand a half, distance 44\", p. 220°. With the Washington twenty-six-inch\r\ntelescope a third star of magnitude fourteen has been found at a\r\ndistance of 40\", p. 182°. In alpha^2 the magnitudes of the components\r\nare three and ten and a half, distance 7.4\", p. 150°. The smaller star\r\nhas a companion of the twelfth or thirteenth magnitude, distance 1.2\",\r\np. 240°. This, of course, is hopelessly beyond our reach. Yet another\r\nstar of magnitude nine, distance 154\", p. 156, we may see easily.\r\n\r\nDropping down to beta, we find it to be a most beautiful and easy\r\ndouble, possessing finely contrasted colors, gold and blue. The larger\r\nstar is of magnitude three, and the smaller, the blue one, of magnitude\r\nsix, distance 205\", p. 267°. Between them there is a very faint star\r\nwhich larger telescopes than ours divide into two, each of magnitude\r\neleven and a half; separated 3\", p. 325°.\r\n\r\nStill farther south and nearly in a line drawn from alpha through beta\r\nwe find a remarkable group of double stars, sigma, pi, rho, and omicron.\r\nThe last three form a beautiful little triangle. We begin with sigma,\r\nthe faintest of the four. The magnitudes of its components are six and\r\nnine, distance 54\", p. 177°. In pi the magnitudes are five and nine,\r\ndistance 3.4\", p. 145°; in rho, magnitudes five and eight, distance\r\n3.8\", p. 177° (a third star of magnitude seven and a half is seen at a\r\ndistance of 4', p. 150°); in omicron, magnitudes six and seven, distance\r\n22\", p. 240°.\r\n\r\nThe star cluster 4608 is small, yet, on a moonless night, worth a glance\r\nwith the five-inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 14.]\r\n\r\nWe now pass northward to the region covered by map No. 14, including the\r\nremainder of Ophiuchus and Serpens. Beginning with the head of Serpens,\r\nin the upper right-hand corner of the map, we find that beta, of\r\nmagnitude three and a half, has a ninth-magnitude companion, distance\r\n30\", p. 265°. The larger star is light blue and the smaller one\r\nyellowish. The little star nu is double, magnitudes five and nine,\r\ndistance 50\", p. 31°, colors contrasted but uncertain. In delta we find\r\na closer double, magnitudes three and four, distance 3.5\", p. 190°. It\r\nis a beautiful object for the three-inch. The leader of the\r\nconstellation, alpha, of magnitude two and a half, has a faint companion\r\nof only the twelfth magnitude, distance 60\", p. 350°. The small star is\r\nbluish. The variable R has a period about a week short of one year, and\r\nat maximum exceeds the sixth magnitude, although sinking at minimum to\r\nless than the eleventh. Its color is ruddy.\r\n\r\nPassing eastward, we turn again into Ophiuchus, and find immediately the\r\nvery interesting double, lambda, whose components are of magnitudes four\r\nand six, distance 1\", p. 55°. This is a long-period binary, and\r\nnotwithstanding the closeness of its stars, our four-inch should\r\nseparate them when the seeing is fine. We shall do better, however, to\r\ntry with the five-inch. Sigma 2166 consists of two stars of magnitudes\r\nsix and seven and a half, distance 27\", p. 280°. Sigma 2173 is a double\r\nof quite a different order. The magnitudes of its components are both\r\nsix, the distance in 1899 0.98\", p. 331°. It is evidently a binary in\r\nrapid motion, as the distance changed from about a quarter of a second\r\nin 1881 to more than a second in 1894. The star tau is a fine triple,\r\nmagnitudes five, six, and nine, distances 1.8\", p. 254°, and 100\", p.\r\n127°. The close pair is a binary system with a long period of\r\nrevolution, estimated at about two hundred years. We discover another\r\ngroup of remarkable doubles in 67, 70, and 73. In the first-named star\r\nthe magnitudes are four and eight, distance 55\", p. 144°, colors\r\nfinely contrasted, pale yellow and red.\r\n\r\nMuch more interesting, however, is 70, a binary whose components have\r\ncompleted a revolution since their discovery by Sir William Herschel,\r\nthe period being ninety-five years. The magnitudes are four and six, or,\r\naccording to Hall, five and six, distance in 1894 2.3\"; in 1900, 1.45\",\r\naccording to Maw. Hall says the apparent distance when the stars are\r\nclosest is about 1.7\", and when they are widest 6.7\". This star is one\r\nof those whose parallax has been calculated with a reasonable degree of\r\naccuracy. Its distance from us is about 1,260,000 times the distance of\r\nthe sun, the average distance apart of the two stars is about\r\n2,800,000,000 miles (equal to the distance of Neptune from the sun), and\r\ntheir combined mass is three times that of the sun. Hall has seen in the\r\nsystem of 70 Ophiuchi three stars of the thirteenth magnitude or less,\r\nat distances of about 60\", 90\", and 165\" respectively.\r\n\r\nThe star 73 is also a close double, and beyond our reach. Its magnitudes\r\nare six and seven, distance 0.7\", p. 245°. It is, no doubt, a binary.\r\n\r\nThree star clusters in Ophiuchus remain to be examined. The first of\r\nthese, No. 4256, is partially resolved into stars by the five-inch. No.\r\n4315 is globular, and has a striking environment of bystanding stars. It\r\nis about one quarter as broad as the full moon, and our largest aperture\r\nreveals the faint coruscation of its crowded components. No. 4410 is a\r\ncoarser and more scattered star swarm--a fine sight!\r\n\r\nFarther toward the east we encounter a part of Serpens again, which\r\ncontains just one object worth glancing at, the double theta, whose\r\nstars are of magnitudes four and four and a half, distance 21\", p. 104°.\r\nColor, both yellow, the smaller star having the deeper hue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 15.]\r\n\r\nLet us next, with the guidance of map No. 15, enter the rich star fields\r\nof Hercules, and of the head and first coils of Draco. According to\r\nArgelander, Hercules contains more stars visible to the naked eye than\r\nany other constellation, and he makes the number of them one hundred and\r\nfifty-five, nearly two thirds of which are only of the sixth magnitude.\r\nBut Heis, who saw more naked-eye stars than Argelander, makes Ursa Major\r\nprecisely equal to Hercules in the number of stars, his enumeration\r\nshowing two hundred and twenty-seven in each constellation, while,\r\naccording to him, Draco follows very closely after, with two hundred and\r\ntwenty stars. Yet, on account of the minuteness of the majority of their\r\nstars, neither of these constellations makes by any means as brilliant a\r\ndisplay as does Orion, to which Argelander assigns only one hundred and\r\nfifteen naked-eye stars, and Heis one hundred and thirty-six.\r\n\r\nWe begin in Hercules with the star kappa, a pretty little double of\r\nmagnitudes five and a half and seven, distance 31\", p. 10°, colors\r\nyellow and red. Not far away we find, in gamma, a larger star with a\r\nfainter companion, the magnitudes in this case being three and a half\r\nand nine, distance 38\", p. 242°, colors white and faint blue or lilac.\r\nOne of the most beautiful of double stars is alpha Herculis. The\r\nmagnitudes are three and six, distance 4.7\", p. 118°, colors orange and\r\ngreen, very distinct. Variability has been ascribed to each of the stars\r\nin turn. It is not known that they constitute a binary system, because\r\nno certain evidence of motion has been obtained. Another very beautiful\r\nand easily separated double is delta, magnitudes three and eight,\r\ndistance 19\", p. 175°, colors pale green and purple.\r\n\r\nSweeping northwestward to zeta, we encounter a celebrated binary, to\r\nseparate which at present requires the higher powers of a six-inch\r\nglass. The magnitudes are three and six and a half, distance in 1899,\r\n0.6\", p. 264°; in 1900, 0.8\", p. 239°. The period of revolution is\r\nthirty-five years, and two complete revolutions have been observed. The\r\napparent distance changes from 0.6\" to 1.6\". They were at their extreme\r\ndistance in 1884.\r\n\r\nTwo pleasing little doubles are Sigma 2101, magnitudes six and nine,\r\ndistance 4\", p. 57°, and Sigma 2104, magnitudes six and eight, distance\r\n6\", p. 20°. At the northern end of the constellation is 42, a double\r\nthat requires the light-grasping power of our largest glass. Its\r\nmagnitudes are six and twelve, distance 20\", p. 94°. In rho we discover\r\nanother distinctly colored double, both stars being greenish or bluish,\r\nwith a difference of tone. The magnitudes are four and five and a half,\r\ndistance 3.7\", p. 309°. But the double 95 is yet more remarkable for the\r\ncolors of its stars. Their magnitudes are five and five and a half,\r\ndistance 6\", p. 262°, colors, according to Webb, \"light apple-green and\r\ncherry-red.\" But other observers have noted different hues, one calling\r\nthem both golden yellow. I think Webb's description is more nearly\r\ncorrect. Sigma 2215 is a very close double, requiring larger telescopes\r\nthan those we are working with. Its magnitudes are six and a half and\r\neight, distance 0.7\", p. 300°. It is probably a binary. Sigma 2289 is\r\nalso close, but our five-inch will separate it: magnitudes six and\r\nseven, distance 1.2\", p. 230°.\r\n\r\nTurning to , we have to deal with a triple, one of whose stars is at\r\npresent beyond the reach of our instruments. The magnitudes of the two\r\nthat we see are four and ten, distance 31\", p. 243°. The tenth-magnitude\r\nstar is a binary of short period (probably less than fifty years), the\r\ndistance of whose components was 2\" in 1859, 1\" in 1880, 0.34\" in 1889,\r\nand 0.54\" in 1891, when the position angle was 25°, and rapidly\r\nincreasing. The distance is still much less than 1\".\r\n\r\nFor a glance at a planetary nebula we may turn with the five-inch to No.\r\n4234. It is very small and faint, only 8\" in diameter, and equal in\r\nbrightness to an eighth-magnitude star. Only close gazing shows that it\r\nis not sharply defined like a star, and that it possesses a bluish tint.\r\nIts spectrum is gaseous.\r\n\r\nThe chief attraction of Hercules we have left for the last, the famous\r\nstar cluster between eta and zeta, No. 4230, more commonly known as M\r\n13. On a still evening in the early summer, when the moon is absent and\r\nthe quiet that the earth enjoys seems an influence descending from the\r\nbrooding stars, the spectacle of this sun cluster in Hercules, viewed\r\nwith a telescope of not less than five-inches aperture, captivates the\r\nmind of the most uncontemplative observer. With the Lick telescope I\r\nhave watched it resolve into separate stars to its very center--a scene\r\nof marvelous beauty and impressiveness. But smaller instruments reveal\r\nonly the in-running star streams and the sprinkling of stellar points\r\nover the main aggregation, which cause it to sparkle like a cloud of\r\ndiamond dust transfused with sunbeams. The appearance of flocking\r\ntogether that those uncountable thousands of stars present calls up at\r\nonce a picture of our lone sun separated from its nearest stellar\r\nneighbor by a distance probably a hundred times as great as the entire\r\ndiameter of the spherical space within which that multitude is\r\ncongregated. It is true that unless we assume what would seem an\r\nunreasonable remoteness for the Hercules cluster, its component stars\r\nmust be much smaller bodies than the sun; yet even that fact does not\r\ndiminish the wonder of their swarming. Here the imagination must bear\r\nscience on its wings, else science can make no progress whatever. It is\r\nan easy step from Hercules to Draco. In the conspicuous diamond-shaped\r\nfigure that serves as a guide-board to the head of the latter, the\r\nsouthernmost star belongs not to Draco but to Hercules. The brightest\r\nstar in this figure is gamma, of magnitude two and a half, with an\r\neleventh-magnitude companion, distant 125\", p. 116°. Two stars of\r\nmagnitude five compose nu, their distance apart being 62\", p. 312°. A\r\nmore interesting double is , magnitudes five and five, distance 2.4\", p.\r\n158°. Both stars are white, and they present a pretty appearance when\r\nthe air is steady. They form a binary system of unknown period. Sigma\r\n2078 (also called 17 Draconis) is a triple, magnitudes six, six and a\r\nhalf, and six, distances 3.8\", p. 116°, and 90\", p. 195°. Sigma 1984 is\r\nan easy double, magnitudes six and a half and eight and a half, distance\r\n6.4\", p. 276°. The star eta is a very difficult double for even our\r\nlargest aperture, on account of the faintness of one of its components.\r\nThe magnitudes are two and a half and ten, distance 4.7\", p. 140°. Its\r\nnear neighbor, Sigma 2054, may be a binary. Its magnitudes are six and\r\nseven, distance 1\", p. 0°. In Sigma 2323 we have another triple,\r\nmagnitudes five, eight and a half, and seven, distances 3.6\", p. 360°,\r\nand 90\", p. 22°, colors white, blue, and reddish. A fine double is\r\nepsilon, magnitudes five and eight, distance 3\", p. 5°.\r\n\r\nThe nebula No. 4373 is of a planetary character, and interesting as\r\noccupying the pole of the ecliptic. A few years ago Dr. Holden, with the\r\nLick telescope, discovered that it is unique in its form. It consists of\r\na double spiral, drawn out nearly in the line of sight, like the thread\r\nof a screw whose axis lies approximately endwise with respect to the\r\nobserver. There is a central star, and another fainter star is involved\r\nin the outer spiral. The form of this object suggests strange ideas as\r\nto its origin. But the details mentioned are far beyond the reach of\r\nour instruments. We shall only see it as a hazy speck. No. 4415 is\r\nanother nebula worth glancing at. It is Tuttle's so-called variable\r\nnebula.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 16.]\r\n\r\nThere are three constellations represented on map No. 16 to which we\r\nshall pay brief visits. First Aquila demands attention. Its doubles may\r\nbe summarized as follows: 11, magnitudes five and nine, distance 17.4\",\r\np. 252°; pi, magnitudes six and seven, distance 1.6\", p. 122°; 23,\r\nmagnitudes six and ten, distance 3.4\", p. 12°--requires the five-inch\r\nand good seeing; 57, magnitudes five and six, distance 36\", p. 170°;\r\nSigma 2654, magnitudes six and eight, distance 12\", p. 234°; Sigma 2644,\r\nmagnitudes six and seven, distance 3.6\", p. 208°.\r\n\r\nThe star eta is an interesting variable between magnitudes three and a\r\nhalf and 4.7; period, seven days, four hours, fourteen minutes. The\r\nsmall red variable R changes from magnitude six to magnitude seven and a\r\nhalf and back again in a period of three hundred and fifty-one days.\r\n\r\nStar cluster No. 4440 is a striking object, its stars ranging from the\r\nninth down to the twelfth magnitude.\r\n\r\nJust north of Aquila is the little constellation Sagitta, containing\r\nseveral interesting doubles and many fine star fields, which may be\r\ndiscovered by sweeping over it with a low-power eyepiece. The star zeta\r\nis double, magnitudes five and nine, distance 8.6\", p. 312°. The larger\r\nstar is itself double, but far too close to be split, except with very\r\nlarge telescopes. In theta we find three components of magnitudes seven,\r\nnine, and eight respectively, distances 11.4\", p. 327°, and 70\", p.\r\n227°. A wide double is epsilon, magnitudes six and eight, distance 92\",\r\np. 81°. Nebula No. 4572 is planetary.\r\n\r\nTurning to Delphinus, we find a very beautiful double in gamma,\r\nmagnitudes four and five, distance 11\", p. 273°, colors golden and\r\nemerald. The leader alpha, which is not as bright as its neighbor beta,\r\nand which is believed to be irregularly variable, is of magnitude four,\r\nand has a companion of nine and a half magnitude at the distance 35\", p.\r\n278°. At a similar distance, 35\", p. 335°, beta has an\r\neleventh-magnitude companion, and the main star is also double, but\r\nexcessively close, and much beyond our reach. It is believed to be a\r\nswiftly moving binary, whose stars are never separated widely enough to\r\nbe distinguished with common telescopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nFROM LYRA TO ERIDANUS\r\n\r\n\"This Orpheus struck when with his wondrous song\r\nHe charmed the woods and drew the rocks along.\"--MANILIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 17.]\r\n\r\nWe resume our celestial explorations with the little constellation Lyra,\r\nwhose chief star, Vega (alpha), has a very good claim to be regarded as\r\nthe most beautiful in the sky. The position of this remarkable star is\r\nindicated in map No. 17. Every eye not insensitive to delicate shades of\r\ncolor perceives at once that Vega is not white, but blue-white. When the\r\ntelescope is turned upon the star the color brightens splendidly.\r\nIndeed, some glasses decidedly exaggerate the blueness of Vega, but the\r\neffect is so beautiful that one can easily forgive the optical\r\nimperfection which produces it. With our four-inch we look for the\r\nwell-known companion of Vega, a tenth-magnitude star, also of a blue\r\ncolor deeper than the hue of its great neighbor. The distance is 50\", p.\r\n158°. Under the most favorable circumstances it might be glimpsed with\r\nthe three-inch, but, upon the whole, I should regard it as too severe a\r\ntest for so small an aperture.\r\n\r\nVega is one of those stars which evidently are not only enormously\r\nlarger than the sun (one estimate makes the ratio in this case nine\r\nhundred to one), but whose physical condition, as far as the\r\nspectroscope reveals it, is very different from that of our ruling orb.\r\nLike Sirius, Vega displays the lines of hydrogen most conspicuously, and\r\nit is probably a much hotter as well as a much more voluminous body\r\nthan the sun.\r\n\r\nClose by, toward the east, two fourth-magnitude stars form a little\r\ntriangle with Vega. Both are interesting objects for the telescope, and\r\nthe northern one, epsilon, has few rivals in this respect. Let us first\r\nlook at it with an opera glass. The slight magnifying power of such an\r\ninstrument divides the star into two twinkling points. They are about\r\ntwo and a quarter minutes of arc apart, and exceptionally sharp-sighted\r\npersons are able to see them divided with the naked eye. Now take the\r\nthree-inch telescope and look at them, with a moderate power. Each of\r\nthe two stars revealed by the opera glass appears double, and a fifth\r\nstar of the ninth magnitude is seen on one side of an imaginary line\r\njoining the two pairs. The northern-most pair is named epsilon_1, the\r\nmagnitudes being fifth and sixth, distance 3\", p. 15°. The other pair is\r\nepsilon_2, magnitudes fifth and sixth, distance 2.3\", p. 133°. Each pair\r\nis apparently a binary; but the period of revolution is unknown. Some\r\nhave guessed a thousand years for one pair, and two thousand for the\r\nother. Another guess gives epsilon_1 a period of one thousand years, and\r\nepsilon_2 a period of eight hundred years. Hall, in his double-star\r\nobservations, simply says of each, \"A slow motion.\"\r\n\r\nPurely by guesswork a period has also been assigned to the two pairs in\r\na supposed revolution around their common center, the time named being\r\nabout a million years. It is not known, however, that such a motion\r\nexists. Manifestly it could not be ascertained within the brief period\r\nduring which scientific observations of these stars have been made. The\r\nimportance of the element of time in the study of stellar motions is\r\nfrequently overlooked, though not, of course, by those who are engaged\r\nin such work. The sun, for instance, and many of the stars are known\r\nto be moving in what appear to be straight lines in space, but\r\nobservations extending over thousands of years would probably show that\r\nthese motions are in curved paths, and perhaps in closed orbits.\r\n\r\nIf now in turn we take our four-inch glass, we shall see something else\r\nin this strange family group of epsilon Lyræ. Between epsilon_1 and\r\nepsilon_2, and placed one on each side of the joining line, appear two\r\nexceedingly faint specks of light, which Sir John Herschel made famous\r\nunder the name of the _debillissima_. They are of the twelfth or\r\nthirteenth magnitude, and possibly variable to a slight degree. If you\r\ncan not see them at first, turn your eye toward one side of the field of\r\nview, and thus, by bringing their images upon a more sensitive part of\r\nthe retina, you may glimpse them. The sight is not much, yet it will\r\nrepay you, as every glance into the depths of the universe does.\r\n\r\nThe other fourth-magnitude star near Vega is zeta, a wide double,\r\nmagnitudes fourth and sixth, distance 44\", p. 150°. Below we find beta,\r\nanother very interesting star, since it is both a multiple and an\r\neccentric variable. It has four companions, three of which we can easily\r\nsee with our three-inch; the fourth calls for the five-inch; the\r\nmagnitudes are respectively four, seven or under, eight, eight and a\r\nhalf, and eleven; distances 45\", p. 150°; 65\", p. 320°; 85\", p. 20°; and\r\n46\", p. 248°. The primary, beta, varies from about magnitude three and a\r\nhalf to magnitude four and a half, the period being twelve days,\r\ntwenty-one hours, forty-six minutes, and fifty-eight seconds. Two\r\nunequal maxima and minima occur within this period. In the spectrum of\r\nthis star some of the hydrogen lines and the D_3 line (the latter\r\nrepresenting helium, a constituent of the sun and of some of the stars,\r\nwhich, until its recent discovery in a few rare minerals was not known\r\nto exist on the earth) are bright, but they vary in visibility.\r\nMoreover, dark lines due to hydrogen also appear in its spectrum\r\nsimultaneously with the bright lines of that element. Then, too, the\r\nbright lines are sometimes seen double. Professor Pickering's\r\nexplanation is that beta Lyræ probably consists of two stars, which,\r\nlike the two composing beta Aurigæ, are too close to be separated with\r\nany telescope now existing, and that the body which gives the bright\r\nlines is revolving in a circle in a period of about twelve days and\r\ntwenty-two hours around the body which gives the dark lines. He has also\r\nsuggested that the appearances could be accounted for by supposing a\r\nbody like our sun to be rotating in twelve days and twenty-two hours,\r\nand having attached to it an enormous protuberance extending over more\r\nthan one hundred and eighty degrees of longitude, so that when one end\r\nof it was approaching us with the rotation of the star the other end\r\nwould be receding, and a splitting of the spectral lines at certain\r\nperiods would be the consequence. \"The variation in light,\" he adds,\r\n\"may be caused by the visibility of a larger or smaller portion of this\r\nprotuberance.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunate star, doomed to carry its parasitical burden of hydrogen and\r\nhelium, like Sindbad in the clasp of the Old Man of the Sea! Surely, the\r\nhuman imagination is never so wonderful as when it bears an astronomer\r\non its wings. Yet it must be admitted that the facts in this case are\r\nwell calculated to summon the genius of hypothesis. And the puzzle is\r\nhardly simplified by Bélopolsky's observation that the body in beta Lyræ\r\ngiving dark hydrogen lines shows those lines also split at certain\r\ntimes. It has been calculated, from a study of the phenomena noted\r\nabove, that the bright-line star in beta Lyræ is situated at a distance\r\nof about fifteen million miles from the center of gravity of the\r\ncuriously complicated system of which it forms a part.\r\n\r\nWe have not yet exhausted the wonders of Lyra. On a line from beta to\r\ngamma, and about one third of the distance from the former to the\r\nlatter, is the celebrated Ring Nebula, indicated on the map by the\r\nnumber 4447. We need all the light we can get to see this object well,\r\nand so, although the three-inch will show it, we shall use the\r\nfive-inch. Beginning with a power of one hundred diameters, which\r\nexhibits it as a minute elliptical ring, rather misty, very soft and\r\ndelicate, and yet distinct, we increase the magnification first to two\r\nhundred and finally to three hundred, in order to distinguish a little\r\nbetter some of the details of its shape. Upon the whole, however, we\r\nfind that the lowest power that clearly brings out the ring gives the\r\nmost satisfactory view. The circumference of the ring is greater than\r\nthat of the planet Jupiter. Its ellipticity is conspicuous, the length\r\nof the longer axis being 78\" and that of the shorter 60\". Closely\r\nfollowing the nebula as it moves through the field of view, our\r\nfive-inch telescope reveals a faint star of the eleventh or twelfth\r\nmagnitude, which is suspected of variability. The largest instruments,\r\nlike the Washington and the Lick glasses, have shown perhaps a dozen\r\nother stars apparently connected with the nebula. A beautiful sparkling\r\neffect which the nebula presents was once thought to be an indication\r\nthat it was really composed of a circle of stars, but the spectroscope\r\nshows that its constitution is gaseous. Just in the middle of the open\r\nring is a feeble star, a mere spark in the most powerful telescope. But\r\nwhen the Ring Nebula is photographed--and this is seen beautifully in\r\nthe photographs made with the Crossley reflector on Mount Hamilton by\r\nthe late Prof. J. E. Keeler--this excessively faint star imprints its\r\nimage boldly as a large bright blur, encircled by the nebulous ring,\r\nwhich itself appears to consist of a series of intertwisted spirals.\r\n\r\nNot far away we find a difficult double star, 17, whose components are\r\nof magnitudes six and ten or eleven, distance 3.7\", p. 325°.\r\n\r\nFrom Lyra we pass to Cygnus, which, lying in one of the richest parts of\r\nthe Milky Way, is a very interesting constellation for the possessor of\r\na telescope. Its general outlines are plainly marked for the naked eye\r\nby the figure of a cross more than twenty degrees in length lying along\r\nthe axis of the Milky Way. The foot of the cross is indicated by the\r\nstar beta, also known as Albireo, one of the most charming of all the\r\ndouble stars. The three-inch amply suffices to reveal the beauty of this\r\nobject, whose components present as sharp a contrast of light yellow and\r\ndeep blue as it would be possible to produce artificially with the\r\npurest pigments. The magnitudes are three and seven, distance 34.6\", p.\r\n55°. No motion has been detected indicating that these stars are\r\nconnected in orbital revolution, yet no one can look at them without\r\nfeeling that they are intimately related to one another. It is a sight\r\nto which one returns again and again, always with undiminished pleasure.\r\nThe most inexperienced observer admires its beauty, and after an hour\r\nspent with doubtful results in trying to interest a tyro in double stars\r\nit is always with a sense of assured success that one turns the\r\ntelescope to beta Cygni.\r\n\r\nFollowing up the beam of the imaginary cross along the current of the\r\nMilky Way, every square degree of which is here worth long gazing into,\r\nwe come to a pair of stars which contend for the name-letter chi. On our\r\nmap the letter is attached to the southernmost of the two, a variable of\r\nlong period--four hundred and six days--whose changes of brilliance lie\r\nbetween magnitudes four and thirteen, but which exhibits much\r\nirregularity in its maxima. The other star, not named but easily\r\nrecognized in the map, is sometimes called 17. It is an attractive\r\ndouble whose colors faintly reproduce those of beta. The magnitudes are\r\nfive and eight, distance 26\", p. 73°. Where the two arms of the cross\r\nmeet is gamma, whose remarkable _cortége_ of small stars running in\r\ncurved streams should not be missed. Use the lowest magnifying power.\r\n\r\nAt the extremity of the western arm of the cross is delta, a close\r\ndouble, difficult for telescopes of moderate aperture on account of the\r\ndifference in the magnitudes of the components. We may succeed in\r\ndividing it with the five-inch. The magnitudes are three and eight,\r\ndistance 1.5\", p. 310°. It is regarded as a binary of long and as yet\r\nunascertained period.\r\n\r\nIn omicron^2 we find a star of magnitude four and orange in color,\r\nhaving two blue companions, the first of magnitude seven and a half,\r\ndistance 107\", p. 174°, and the second of magnitude five and a half,\r\ndistance 358\", p. 324°. Farther north is psi, which presents to us the\r\ncombination of a white five-and-a-half-magnitude star with a lilac star\r\nof magnitude seven and a half. The distance is 3\", p. 184°. A very\r\npretty sight.\r\n\r\nWe now pass to the extremity of the other arm of the cross, near which\r\nlies the beautiful little double 49, whose components are of magnitudes\r\nsix and eight, distance 2.8\", p. 50°. The colors are yellow and blue,\r\nconspicuous and finely contrasted. A neighboring double of similar hues\r\nis 52, in which the magnitudes are four and nine, distance 6\", p. 60°.\r\nSweeping a little way northward we come upon an interesting binary,\r\nlambda, which is unfortunately beyond the dividing power of our largest\r\nglass. A good seven-inch or seven-and-a-half-inch should split it under\r\nfavorable circumstances. Its magnitudes are six and seven, distance\r\n0.66\", p. 74°.\r\n\r\nThe next step carries us to a very famous object, 61 Cygni, long known\r\nas the nearest star in the northern hemisphere of the heavens. It is a\r\ndouble which our three-inch will readily divide, the magnitudes being\r\nboth six, distance 21\", p. 122°. The distance of 61 Cygni, according to\r\nHall's parallax of 0.27\", is about 70,000,000,000,000 miles. There is\r\nsome question whether or not it is a binary, for, while the twin stars\r\nare both moving in the same direction in space with comparative\r\nrapidity, yet conclusive evidence of orbital motion is lacking. When one\r\nhas noticed the contrast in apparent size between this comparatively\r\nnear-by star, which the naked eye only detects with considerable\r\ndifficulty, and some of its brilliant neighbors whose distance is so\r\ngreat as to be immeasurable with our present means, no better proof will\r\nbe needed of the fact that the faintness of a star is not necessarily an\r\nindication of remoteness.\r\n\r\nWe may prepare our eyes for a beautiful exhibition of contrasted colors\r\nonce more in the star . This is really a quadruple, although only two of\r\nits components are close and conspicuous. The magnitudes are five, six,\r\nseven and a half, and twelve; distances 2.4\", p. 121°; 208\", p. 56°; and\r\n35\", p. 264°. The color of the largest star is white and that of its\r\nnearest companion blue; the star of magnitude seven and a half is also\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nThe star cluster 4681 is a fine sight with our largest glass. In the map\r\nwe find the place marked where the new star of 1876 made its appearance.\r\nThis was first noticed on November 24, 1876, when it shone with the\r\nbrilliance of a star of magnitude three and a half. Its spectrum was\r\ncarefully studied, especially by Vogel, and the very interesting changes\r\nthat it underwent were noted. Within a year the star had faded to less\r\nthan the tenth magnitude, and its spectrum had completely changed in\r\nappearance, and had come to bear a close resemblance to that of a\r\nplanetary nebula. This has been quoted as a possible instance of a\r\ncelestial collision through whose effects the solid colliding masses\r\nwere vaporized and expanded into a nebula. At present the star is very\r\nfaint and can only be seen with the most powerful telescopes. Compare\r\nwith the case of Nova Aurigæ, previously discussed.\r\n\r\nUnderneath Cygnus we notice the small constellation Vulpecula. It\r\ncontains a few objects worthy of attention, the first being the nebula\r\n4532, the \"dumb-bell nebula\" of Lord Rosse. With the four-inch, and\r\nbetter with the five-inch, we are able to perceive that it consists of\r\ntwo close-lying tufts of misty light. Many stars surround it, and large\r\ntelescopes show them scattered between the two main masses of the\r\nnebula. The Lick photographs show that its structure is spiral. The star\r\n11 points out the place where a new star of the third magnitude appeared\r\nin 1670. Sigma 2695 is a close double, magnitudes six and eight,\r\ndistance 0.96\", p. 78°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 18.]\r\n\r\nWe turn to map No. 18, and, beginning at the western end of the\r\nconstellation Aquarius, we find the variable T, which ranges between\r\nmagnitudes seven and thirteen in a period of about two hundred and three\r\ndays. Its near neighbor Sigma 2729 is a very close double, beyond the\r\nseparating power of our five-inch, the magnitudes being six and seven,\r\ndistance 0.6\", p. 176°. Sigma 2745, also known as 12 Aquarii, is a good\r\ndouble for the three-inch. Its magnitudes are six and eight, distance\r\n2.8\", p. 190°. In zeta we discover a beauty. It is a slow binary of\r\nmagnitudes four and four, distance 3.1\", p. 321°. According to some\r\nobservers both stars have a greenish tinge. The star 41 is a wider\r\ndouble, magnitudes six and eight, distance 5\", p. 115°, colors yellow\r\nand blue. The uncommon stellar contrast of white with light garnet is\r\nexhibited by tau, magnitudes six and nine, distance 27\", p. 115°. Yellow\r\nand blue occur again conspicuously in psi, magnitudes four and a half\r\nand eight and a half, distance 50\", p. 310°. Rose and emerald have been\r\nrecorded as the colors exhibited in Sigma 2998, whose magnitudes are\r\nfive and seven, distance 1.3\", p. 346°.\r\n\r\nThe variables S and R are both red. The former ranges between magnitudes\r\neight and twelve, period two hundred and eighty days, and the latter\r\nbetween magnitudes six and eleven, period about three hundred and ninety\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe nebula 4628 is Rosse's \"Saturn nebula,\" so called because with his\r\ngreat telescope it presented the appearance of a nebulous model of the\r\nplanet Saturn. With our five-inch we see it simply as a planetary\r\nnebula. We may also glance at another nebula, 4678, which appears\r\ncircular and is pinned with a little star at the edge.\r\n\r\nThe small constellation Equuleus contains a surprisingly large number of\r\ninteresting objects. Sigma 2735 is a rather close double, magnitudes six\r\nand eight, distance 1.8\", p. 287°. Sigma 2737 (the first star to the\r\nleft of Sigma 2735, the name having accidentally been omitted from the\r\nmap) is a beautiful triple, although the two closest stars, of\r\nmagnitudes six and seven, can not be separated by our instruments. Their\r\ndistance in 1886 was 0.78\", p. 286°, and they had then been closing\r\nrapidly since 1884, when the distance was 1.26\". The third star, of\r\nmagnitude eight, is distant 11\", p. 75°. Sigma 2744 consists of two\r\nstars, magnitudes six and seven, distance 1.4\", p. 1.67°. It is probably\r\na binary. Sigma 2742 is wider double, magnitudes both six, distance\r\n2.6\", p. 225°. Another triple, one of whose components is beyond our\r\nreach, is gamma. Here the magnitudes are fifth, twelfth, and sixth,\r\ndistances 2\", p. 274° and 366\". It would also be useless for us to try\r\nto separate delta, but it is interesting to remember that this is one of\r\nthe closest of known double stars, the magnitudes being fourth and\r\nfifth, distance 0.4\", p. 198°. These data are from Hall's measurements\r\nin 1887. The star is, no doubt, a binary. With the five-inch we may\r\ndetect one and perhaps two of the companion stars in the quadruple beta.\r\nThe magnitudes are five, ten, and two eleven, distances 67\", p. 309°;\r\n86\", p. 276°; and 6.5\", p. 15°. The close pair is comprised in the\r\ntenth-magnitude star.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 19.]\r\n\r\nMap No. 19 introduces us to the constellation Pegasus, which is\r\ncomparatively barren to the naked eye, and by no means rich in\r\ntelescopic phenomena. The star epsilon, of magnitude two and a half, has\r\na blue companion of the eighth magnitude, distance 138\", p. 324°; colors\r\nyellow and violet. A curious experiment that may be tried with this star\r\nis described by Webb, who ascribes the discovery of the phenomenon to\r\nSir John Herschel. When near the meridian the small star in epsilon\r\nappears, in the telescope, underneath the large one. If now the tube of\r\nthe telescope be slightly swung from side to side the small star will\r\nappear to describe a pendulumlike movement with respect to the large\r\none. The explanation suggested is that the comparative faintness of the\r\nsmall star causes its light to affect the retina of the eye less quickly\r\nthan does that of its brighter companion, and, in consequence, the\r\nreversal of its apparent motion with the swinging of the telescope is\r\nnot perceived so soon.\r\n\r\nThe third-magnitude star eta has a companion of magnitude ten and a\r\nhalf, distance 90\", p. 340°. The star beta, of the second magnitude, and\r\nreddish, is variable to the extent of half a magnitude in an irregular\r\nperiod, and gamma, of magnitude two and a half, has an\r\neleventh-magnitude companion, distance 162\", p. 285°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 20.]\r\n\r\nOur interest is revived on turning, with the guidance of map No. 20,\r\nfrom the comparative poverty of Pegasus to the spacious constellation\r\nCetus. The first double star that we meet in this constellation is 26,\r\nwhose components are of magnitudes six and nine, distance 16.4\", p.\r\n252°; colors, topaz and lilac. Not far away is the closer double 42,\r\ncomposed of a sixth and a seventh magnitude star, distance 1.25\", p.\r\n350°. The four-inch is capable of splitting this star, but we shall do\r\nbetter to use the five-inch. In passing we may glance at the\r\ntenth-magnitude companion to eta, distance 225\", p. 304°. Another wide\r\npair is found in zeta, magnitudes three and nine, distance 185\", p. 40°.\r\n\r\nThe next step brings us to the wonderful variable omicron, or Mira,\r\nwhose changes have been watched for three centuries, the first observer\r\nof the variability of the star having been David Fabricius in 1596. Not\r\nonly is the range of variability very great, but the period is\r\nremarkably irregular. In the time of Hevelius, Mira was once invisible\r\nfor four years. When brightest, the star is of about the second\r\nmagnitude, and when faintest, of the ninth magnitude, but at maximum it\r\nseldom exhibits the greatest brilliance that it has on a few occasions\r\nshown itself capable of attaining. Ordinarily it begins to fade after\r\nreaching the fourth or fifth magnitude. The period averages about three\r\nhundred and thirty-one days, but is irregularly variable to the extent\r\nof twenty-five days. Its color is red, and its spectrum shows bright\r\nlines, which it is believed disappear when the star sinks to a minimum.\r\nAmong the various theories proposed to account for such changes as these\r\nthe most probable appears to be that which ascribes them to some cause\r\nanalogous to that operating in the production of sun spots. The\r\noutburst of light, however, as pointed out by Scheiner, should be\r\nregarded as corresponding to the maximum and not the minimum stage of\r\nsun-spot activity. According to this view, the star is to be regarded as\r\npossessing an extensive atmosphere of hydrogen, which, during the\r\nmaximum, is upheaved into enormous prominences, and the brilliance of\r\nthe light from these prominences suffices to swamp the photospheric\r\nlight, so that in the spectrum the hydrogen lines appear bright instead\r\nof dark.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to suppose that Mira can be the center of a system of\r\nhabitable planets, no matter what we may think of the more constant\r\nstars in that regard, because its radiation manifestly increases more\r\nthan six hundred fold, and then falls off again to an equal extent once\r\nin every ten or eleven months. I have met people who can not believe\r\nthat the Almighty would make a sun and then allow its energies \"to go to\r\nwaste,\" by not supplying it with a family of worlds. But I imagine that\r\nif they had to live within the precincts of Mira Ceti they would cry out\r\nfor exemption from their own law of stellar utility.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful double star in Cetus is gamma, magnitudes three and\r\nseven, distance 3\", p. 288°; hues, straw-color and blue. The leading\r\nstar alpha, of magnitude two and a half, has a distant blue companion\r\nthree magnitudes fainter, and between them are two minute stars, the\r\nsouthernmost of which is a double, magnitudes both eleven, distance 10\",\r\np. 225°.\r\n\r\nThe variable S ranges between magnitudes seven and twelve in a somewhat\r\nirregular period of about eleven months, while R ranges between the\r\nseventh and the thirteenth magnitudes in a period of one hundred and\r\nsixty-seven days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 21.]\r\n\r\nThe constellation Eridanus, represented in map No. 21, contains a few\r\nfine double stars, one of the most interesting of which is 12, a rather\r\nclose binary. The magnitudes are four and eight, distance 2\", p. 327°.\r\nWe shall take the five-inch for this, and a steady atmosphere and sharp\r\nseeing will be necessary on account of the wide difference in the\r\nbrightness of the component stars. Amateurs frequently fail to make due\r\nallowance for the effect of such difference. When the limit of\r\nseparating power for a telescope of a particular aperture is set at 1\"\r\nor 2\", as the case may be, it is assumed that the stars composing the\r\ndoubles on which the test is made shall be of nearly the same magnitude,\r\nor at least that they shall not differ by more than one or two\r\nmagnitudes at the most. The stray light surrounding a comparatively\r\nbright star tends to conceal a faint companion, although the telescope\r\nmay perfectly separate them so far as the stellar disks are concerned.\r\nThen, too, I have observed in my own experience that a very faint and\r\nclose double is more difficult than a brighter pair not more widely\r\nseparated, usually on account of the defect of light, and this is true\r\neven when the components of the faint double are of equal magnitude.\r\n\r\nSigma 470, otherwise known as 32 Eridani, is a superb object on account\r\nof the colors of its components, the larger star being a rich topaz and\r\nthe smaller an ultramarine; while the difference in magnitude is not as\r\ngreat as in many of the colored doubles. The magnitudes are five and\r\nseven, distance 6.7\", p. 348°. The star gamma, of magnitude two and a\r\nhalf, has a tenth-magnitude companion, distant 51\", p. 238°. Sigma 516,\r\nalso called 39 Eridani, consists of two stars of magnitudes six and\r\nnine, distance 6.4\", p. 150°; colors, yellow and blue. The supposed\r\nbinary character of this star has not yet been established.\r\n\r\nIn omicron^2 we come upon an interesting triple star, two of whose\r\ncomponents at any rate we can easily see. The largest component is of\r\nthe fourth magnitude. At a distance of 82\", p. 105°, we find a\r\ntenth-magnitude companion. This companion is itself double, the\r\nmagnitudes of its components being ten and eleven, distance 2.6\", p.\r\n98°. Hall says of these stars that they \"form a remarkable system.\" He\r\nhas also observed a fourth star of the twelfth magnitude, distant 45\"\r\nfrom the largest star, p. 85°. This is apparently unconnected with the\r\nothers, although it is only half as distant as the tenth-magnitude\r\ncomponent is from the primary. Sigma 590 is interesting because of the\r\nsimilarity of its two components in size, both being of about the\r\nseventh magnitude, distance 10\", p. 318°.\r\n\r\nFinally, we turn to the nebula 826. This is planetary in form and\r\ninconspicuous, but Lassell has described it as presenting a most\r\nextraordinary appearance with his great reflector--a circular nebula\r\nlying upon another fainter and larger nebula of a similar shape, and\r\nhaving a star in its center. Yet it may possibly be an immensely distant\r\nstar cluster instead of a nebula, since its spectrum does not appear to\r\nbe gaseous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPISCES, ARIES, TAURUS, AND THE NORTHERN STARS\r\n\r\n\"Now sing we stormy skies when Autumn weighs\r\nThe year, and adds to nights and shortens days,\r\nAnd suns declining shine with feeble rays.\"--DRYDEN'S VIRGIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 22.]\r\n\r\nThe eastern end of Pisces, represented in map No. 22, includes most of\r\nthe interesting telescopic objects that the constellation contains. We\r\nbegin our exploration at the star numbered 55, a double that is very\r\nbeautiful when viewed with the three-inch glass. The components are of\r\nmagnitudes five and eight, distance 6.6\", p. 192°. The larger star is\r\nyellow and the smaller deep blue. The star 65, while lacking the\r\npeculiar charm of contrasted colors so finely displayed in 55, possesses\r\nan attraction in the equality of its components which are both of the\r\nsixth magnitude and milk-white. The distance is 4.5\", p. 118°. In 66 we\r\nfind a swift binary whose components are at present far too close for\r\nany except the largest telescopes. The distance in 1894 was only 0.36\",\r\np. 329°. The magnitudes are six and seven. In contrast with this\r\nexcessively close double is psi, whose components are both of magnitude\r\nfive and a half, distance 30\", p. 160°. Dropping down to 77 we come upon\r\nanother very wide and pleasing double, magnitudes six and seven,\r\ndistance 33\", p. 82°, colors white and lilac or pale blue. Hardly less\r\nbeautiful is zeta magnitudes five and six, distance 24\", p. 64°. Finest\r\nof all is alpha, which exhibits a remarkable color contrast, the larger\r\nstar being greenish and the smaller blue. The magnitudes are four and\r\nfive, distance 3\", p. 320°. This star is a binary, but the motion is\r\nslow. The variable R ranges between magnitudes seven and thirteen,\r\nperiod three hundred and forty-four days.\r\n\r\nThe constellation Aries contains several beautiful doubles, all but one\r\nof which are easy for our smallest aperture. The most striking of these\r\nis gamma, which is historically interesting as the first double star\r\ndiscovered. The discovery was made by Robert Hooke in 1664 by accident,\r\nwhile he was following the comet of that year with his telescope. He\r\nexpressed great surprise on noticing that the glass divided the star,\r\nand remarked that he had not met with a like instance in all the\r\nheavens. His observations could not have been very extensive or very\r\ncarefully conducted, for there are many double stars much wider than\r\ngamma Arietis which Hooke could certainly have separated if he had\r\nexamined them. The magnitudes of the components of gamma are four and\r\nfour and a half, or, according to Hall, both four; distance 8.5\", p.\r\n180°. A few degrees above gamma, passing by beta, is a wide double\r\nlambda, magnitudes five and eight, distance 37\", p. 45°, colors white\r\nand lilac or violet. Three stars are to be seen in 14: magnitudes five\r\nand a half, ten, and nine, distances 83\", p. 36°, and 106\", p. 278°,\r\ncolors white, blue, and lilac. The star 30 is a very pretty double,\r\nmagnitudes six and seven, distance 38.6\", p. 273°. Sigma 289 consists of\r\na topaz star combined with a sapphire, magnitudes six and nine, distance\r\n28.5\", p. 0°. The fourth-magnitude star 41 has several faint companions.\r\nThe magnitudes of two of these are eleven and nine, distances 34\", p.\r\n203°, and 130\", p. 230°. We discover another triple in pi, magnitudes\r\nfive, eight, and eleven, distances 3.24\", p. 122°, and 25\", p. 110°. The\r\ndouble mentioned above as being too close for our three-inch glass is\r\nepsilon, which, however, can be divided with the four-inch, although the\r\nfive-inch will serve us better. The magnitudes are five and a half and\r\nsix, distance 1.26\", p. 202°. The star 52 has two companions, one of\r\nwhich is so close that our instruments can not separate it, while the\r\nother is too faint to be visible in the light of its brilliant neighbor\r\nwithout the aid of a very powerful telescope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 23.]\r\n\r\nWe are now about to enter one of the most magnificent regions in the\r\nsky, which is hardly less attractive to the naked eye than Orion, and\r\nwhich men must have admired from the beginning of their history on the\r\nearth, the constellation Taurus (map No. 23). Two groups of stars\r\nespecially distinguish Taurus, the Hyades and the Pleiades, and both are\r\nexceedingly interesting when viewed with the lowest magnifying powers of\r\nour telescopes.\r\n\r\nWe shall begin with a little star just west of the Pleiades, Sigma 412,\r\nalso called 7 Tauri. This is a triple, but we can see it only as a\r\ndouble, the third star being exceedingly close to the primary. The\r\nmagnitudes are six and a half, seven, and ten, distances 0.3\", p. 216°,\r\nand 22\", p. 62°. In the Pleiades we naturally turn to the brightest star\r\neta, or Alcyone, famous for having once been regarded as the central sun\r\naround which our sun and a multitude of other luminaries were supposed\r\nto revolve, and picturesque on account of the little triangle of small\r\nstars near it which the least telescopic assistance enables us to see.\r\nOne may derive much pleasure from a study of the various groupings of\r\nstars in the Pleiades. Photography has demonstrated, what had long been\r\nsuspected from occasional glimpses revealed by the telescope, that this\r\ncelebrated cluster of stars is intermingled with curious forms of\r\nnebulæ. The nebulous matter appears in festoons, apparently attached to\r\nsome of the larger stars, such as Alcyone, Merope, and Maia, and in\r\nlong, narrow, straight lines, the most remarkable of which, a faintly\r\nluminous thread starting midway between Maia and Alcyone and running\r\neastward some 40', is beaded with seven or eight stars. The width of\r\nthis strange nebulous streak is, on an average, 3\" or 4\", and there is,\r\nperhaps, no more wonderful phenomenon anywhere in celestial space.\r\nUnfortunately, no telescope is able to show it, and all our knowledge\r\nabout it is based upon photographs. It might be supposed that it was a\r\nnebulous disk seen edgewise, but for the fact that at the largest star\r\ninvolved in its course it bends sharply about 10° out of its former\r\ndirection, and for the additional fact that it seems to take its origin\r\nfrom a curved offshoot of the intricate nebulous mass surrounding Maia.\r\nExactly at the point where this curve is transformed into a straight\r\nline shines a small star! In view of all the facts the idea does not\r\nseem to be very far-fetched that in the Pleiades we behold an assemblage\r\nof suns, large and small, formed by the gradual condensation of a\r\nnebula, and in which evolution has gone on far beyond the stage\r\nrepresented by the Orion nebula, where also a group of stars may be in\r\nprocess of formation out of nebulous matter. If we look a little farther\r\nalong this line of development, we may perceive in such a stellar\r\nassemblage as the cluster in Hercules, a still later phase wherein all\r\nthe originally scattered material has, perhaps, been absorbed into the\r\nstarry nuclei.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHIEF STARS IN THE PLEIADES.]\r\n\r\nThe yellow star Sigma 430 has two companions: magnitudes six, nine, and\r\nnine and a half, distances 26\", p. 55°, and 39\", p. 302°. The star 30 of\r\nthe fifth magnitude has a companion of the ninth magnitude, distance 9\",\r\np. 58°, colors emerald and purple, faint. An interesting variable, of\r\nthe type of Algol, is lambda, which at maximum is of magnitude three and\r\nfour tenths and at minimum of magnitude four and two tenths. Its period\r\nfrom one maximum to the next is about three days and twenty-three hours,\r\nbut the actual changes occupy only about ten hours, and it loses light\r\nmore swiftly than it regains it. A combination of red and blue is\r\npresented by Phi (mistakenly marked on map No. 23 as psi). The\r\nmagnitudes are six and eight, distance 56\", p. 242°. A double of similar\r\nmagnitudes is chi, distance 19\", p. 25°. Between the two stars which the\r\nnaked eye sees in kappa is a minute pair, each of less than the eleventh\r\nmagnitude, distance 5\", p. 324°. Another naked-eye double is formed by\r\ntheta^1 and theta^2, in the Hyades. The magnitudes are five and five and\r\na half, distance about 5' 37\".\r\n\r\nThe leading star of Taurus, Aldebaran (alpha), is celebrated for its\r\nreddish color. The precise hue is rather uncertain, but Aldebaran is not\r\norange as Betelgeuse in Orion is, and no correct eye can for an instant\r\nconfuse the colors of these two stars, although many persons seem to be\r\nunable to detect the very plain difference between them in this respect.\r\nAldebaran has been called \"rose-red,\" and it would be an interesting\r\noccupation for an amateur to determine, with the aid of some proper\r\ncolor scale, the precise hue of this star, and of the many other stars\r\nwhich exhibit chromatic idiosyncrasy. Aldebaran is further interesting\r\nas being a standard first-magnitude star. With the four-inch glass we\r\nsee without difficulty the tenth-magnitude companion following Aldebaran\r\nat a distance of 114\", p. 35°. There is an almost inexplicable charm\r\nabout these faint attendants of bright stars, which is quite different\r\nfrom the interest attaching to a close and nearly equal pair. The\r\nimpression of physical relationship is never lacking though it may be\r\ndeceptive, and this awakens a lively appreciation of the vast\r\ndifferences of magnitude that exist among the different suns of space.\r\n\r\nThe actual size and might of this great red sun form an attractive\r\nsubject for contemplation. As it appears to our eyes Aldebaran gives one\r\ntwenty-five-thousand-millionth as much light as the sun, but if we were\r\nplaced midway between them the star would outshine the sun in the ratio\r\nof not less than 160 to 1. And yet, gigantic as it is, Aldebaran is\r\npossibly a pygmy in comparison with Arcturus, whose possible dimensions\r\nwere discussed in the chapter relating to Boötes. Although Aldebaran is\r\nknown to possess several of the metallic elements that exist in the sun,\r\nits spectrum differs widely from the solar spectrum in some respects,\r\nand more closely resembles that of Arcturus.\r\n\r\nOther interesting objects in Taurus are sigma, divisible with the naked\r\neye, magnitudes five and five and a half, distance 7'; Sigma 674,\r\ndouble, magnitudes six and nine, distance 10.5\", p. 147°; Sigma 716,\r\ndouble, magnitudes six and seven, distance 5\", p. 200°--a pleasing\r\nsight; tau, triple, magnitudes four, ten and a half, and eleven,\r\ndistances 36\", p. 249°, and 36\", p. 60°--the ten-and-a-half-magnitude\r\nstar is itself double, as discovered by Burnham; star cluster No. 1030,\r\nnot quite as broad as the moon, and containing some stars as large as\r\nthe eleventh magnitude; and nebula No. 1157, the so-called \"Crab nebula\"\r\nof Lord Rosse, which our glasses will show only as a misty patch of\r\nfaint light, although large telescopes reveal in it a very curious\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 24.]\r\n\r\nWe now turn to the cluster of circumpolar constellations sometimes\r\ncalled the Royal Family, in allusion to the well-known story of the\r\nEthiopian king Cepheus and his queen Cassiopeia, whose daughter\r\nAndromeda was exposed on the seashore to be devoured by a monster, but\r\nwho was saved by the hero Perseus. All these mythologic personages are\r\nrepresented in the constellations that we are about to study.[4] We\r\nbegin with Andromeda (map No. 24). The leading star alpha marks one\r\ncorner of the great square of Pegasus. The first star of telescopic\r\ninterest that we find in Andromeda is , a double difficult on account of\r\nthe faintness of the smaller component. The magnitudes are four and\r\neleven, distance 49\", p. 110°. A few degrees north of the naked eye\r\ndetects a glimmering point where lies the Great Nebula in Andromeda.\r\nThis is indicated on the map by the number 116. With either of our three\r\ntelescopes it is an interesting object, but of course it is advisable to\r\nuse our largest glass in order to get as much light as possible. All\r\nthat we can see is a long, shuttle-shaped nebulous object, having a\r\nbrighter point near the center. Many stars are scattered over the field\r\nin its neighborhood, but the nebula itself, although its spectrum is\r\npeculiar in resembling that of a faint star, is evidently a gaseous or\r\nat any rate a meteoritic mass, since photographs show it to be composed\r\nof a series of imperfectly separated spirals surrounding a vast central\r\ncondensation. This peculiarity of the Andromeda nebula, which is\r\ninvisible with telescopes although conspicuous in the photographs, has,\r\nsince its discovery a few years ago, given a great impetus to\r\nspeculation concerning the transformation of nebulæ into stars and star\r\nclusters. No one can look at a good photograph of this wonderful\r\nphenomenon without noticing its resemblance to the ideal state of things\r\nwhich, according to the nebular hypothesis, must once have existed in\r\nthe solar system. It is to be remembered, however, that there is\r\nprobably sufficient material in the Andromeda nebula to make a system\r\nmany times, perhaps hundreds or thousands of times, as extensive as that\r\nof which our sun is the center. If one contemplates this nebula only\r\nlong enough to get a clear perception of the fact that creation was not\r\nended when, according to the Mosaic history, God, having in six days\r\nfinished \"the heavens and the earth and all the host of them,\" rested\r\nfrom all his work, a good blow will have been dealt for the cause of\r\ntruth. Systems far vaster than ours are now in the bud, and long before\r\nthey have bloomed, ambitious man, who once dreamed that all these things\r\nwere created to serve him, will probably have vanished with the\r\nextinguishment of the little star whose radiant energy made his life and\r\nhis achievements briefly possible.\r\n\r\n[4] For further details on this subject see Astronomy with an\r\nOpera-glass.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1885, a new star of magnitude six and a half made its\r\nappearance suddenly near the center of the Andromeda nebula. Within one\r\nyear it had disappeared, having gradually dwindled until the great\r\nWashington telescope, then the largest in use, no longer showed it. That\r\nthis was a phenomenon connected with the nebula is most probable, but\r\njust what occurred to produce it nobody knows. The observed appearances\r\nmight have been produced by a collision, and no better hypothesis has\r\nyet been suggested to account for them.\r\n\r\nNear the opposite end of the constellation from alpha we find the most\r\ninteresting of triple stars in gamma. The two larger components of this\r\nbeautiful star are of magnitudes three and six, distance 10\", colors\r\ngolden yellow and deep blue. The three-inch shows them finely. The\r\nsmaller star is itself double, its companion being of magnitude eight,\r\ndistance when discovered in 1842 0.5\", color bluish green. A few years\r\nago this third star got so close to its primary that it was invisible\r\neven with the highest powers of the great Lick telescope, but at present\r\nit is widening again. In October, 1893, I had the pleasure of looking at\r\ngamma Andromedæ with the Lick telescope, and at that time it was\r\npossible just to separate the third star. The angle seemed too small for\r\ncertain measurement, but a single setting of the micrometer by Mr.\r\nBarnard, to whose kindness I was indebted for my view of the star, gave\r\n0.17\" as the approximate distance. In 1900 the distance had increased to\r\n0.4\", p. 115°. The brilliance of color contrast between the two larger\r\nstars of gamma Andromedæ is hardly inferior to that exhibited in beta\r\nCygni, so that this star may be regarded as one of the most picturesque\r\nof stellar objects for small telescopes.\r\n\r\nOther pleasing objects in this constellation are the binary star 36,\r\nmagnitudes six and six and a half, distance 1\", p. 17°--the two stars\r\nare slowly closing and the five-inch glass is required to separate them:\r\nthe richly colored variable R, which fades from magnitude five and a\r\nhalf to invisibility, and then recovers its light in a period of about\r\nfour hundred and five days; and the bright star cluster 457, which\r\ncovers a space about equal to the area of the full moon.\r\n\r\nJust south of the eastern end of Andromeda is the small constellation\r\nTriangulum, or the Triangles, containing two interesting objects. One of\r\nthese is the beautiful little double 6, magnitudes five and six,\r\ndistance 3.8\", p. 77°, colors yellow and blue; and the other, the nebula\r\n352, which equals in extent the star cluster in Andromeda described\r\nabove, but nevertheless appears very faint with our largest glass. Its\r\nfaintness, however, is not an indication of insignificance, for to very\r\npowerful telescopes it exhibits a wonderful system of nuclei and\r\nspirals--another bit of chaos that is yielding by age-long steps to the\r\ninfluence of demiurgic forces.\r\n\r\nA richer constellation than Andromeda, both for naked-eye and telescopic\r\nobservation, is Perseus, which is especially remarkable for its star\r\nclusters. Two of these, 512 and 521, constitute the celebrated double\r\ncluster, sometimes called the Sword-hand of Perseus, and also chi\r\nPersei. To the smallest telescope this aggregation of stars, ranging in\r\nmagnitude from six and a half to fourteen, and grouped about two\r\nneighboring centers, presents a marvelous appearance. As an educative\r\nobject for those unaccustomed to celestial observations it may be\r\ncompared among star clusters to beta Cygni among double stars, for the\r\nmost indifferent spectator is struck with wonder in viewing it. All the\r\nother clusters in Perseus represented on the map are worth examining,\r\nalthough none of them calls for special mention, except perhaps 584,\r\nwhere we may distinguish at least a hundred separate stars within an\r\narea less than one quarter as expansive as the face of the moon.\r\n\r\nAmong the double stars of Perseus we note first eta, whose components\r\nare of magnitudes four and eight, distance 28\", colors white and pale\r\nblue. The double epsilon is especially interesting on account of an\r\nalleged change of color from blue to red which the smaller star\r\nundergoes coincidently with a variation of brightness. The magnitudes\r\nare three and eight, distance 9\", p. 9°. An interesting multiple is\r\nzeta, two of whose stars at least we can see. The magnitudes are three,\r\nnine, ten, and ten, distances 13\", p. 207°, 90\", and 112\".\r\n\r\nThe chief attraction in Perseus is the changeful and wonderful beta, or\r\nAlgol, the great typical star among the short-period variables. During\r\nthe greater part of its period this star is of magnitude two and two\r\ntenths, but for a very short time, following a rapid loss of light, it\r\nremains at magnitude three and seven tenths. The difference, one\r\nmagnitude and a half, corresponds to an actual difference in brightness\r\nin the ratio of 3.75 to 1. The entire loss of light during the\r\ndeclension occupies only four hours and a half. The star remains at its\r\nfaintest for a few minutes only before a perceptible gain of light\r\noccurs, and the return to maximum is as rapid as was the preceding\r\ndecline. The period from one minimum to the next is two days twenty\r\nhours forty-eight minutes fifty-three seconds, with an irregularity\r\namounting to a few seconds in a year. The Arabs named the star Algol, or\r\nthe Demon, on account of its eccentricity which did not escape their\r\nattention; and when Goodricke, in 1782, applied a scientific method of\r\nobservation to it, the real cause of its variations was suggested by\r\nhim, but his explanation failed of general acceptance until its truth\r\nwas established by Prof. E. C. Pickering in 1880. This explanation gives\r\nus a wonderful insight into stellar constitution. According to it, Algol\r\npossesses a companion as large as the sun, but invisible, both because\r\nof its proximity to that star and because it yields no light, and\r\nrevolving in a plane horizontal to our line of sight. The period of\r\nrevolution is identical with the period of Algol's cycle of variation,\r\nand the diminution of light is caused by the interposition of the dark\r\nbody as it sweeps along that part of its orbit lying between our point\r\nof view and the disk of Algol. In other words, once in every two days\r\ntwenty hours and forty-nine minutes Algol, as seen from the earth,\r\nundergoes a partial eclipse.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the great comparative mass of its dark companion,\r\nAlgol itself moves in an orbit around their common center with a\r\nvelocity quite sufficient to be detected by the shifting of the lines in\r\nits spectrum. By means of data thus obtained the mass, size, and\r\ndistance apart of Algol and its singular comrade have been inferred. The\r\ndiameter of Algol is believed to be about 1,125,000 miles, that of the\r\ndark body about 840,000 miles, and the mean distance from center to\r\ncenter 3,230,000 miles. The density of both the light and the dark star\r\nis slight compared with that of the sun, so that their combined mass is\r\nonly two thirds as great as the sun's.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of a slight irregularity in Algol's period of\r\nvariation. Basing his calculations upon this inequality, Dr. Chandler\r\nhas put forward the hypothesis that there is another invisible body\r\nconnected with Algol, and situated at a distance from it of about\r\n1,800,000,000 miles, and that around this body, which is far more\r\nmassive than the others, Algol and its companions revolve in a period of\r\none hundred and thirty years! Dr. Chandler has earned the right to have\r\nhis hypotheses regarded with respect, even when they are as\r\nextraordinary as that which has just been described. It needs no\r\nindulgence of the imagination to lend interest to Algol; the simple\r\nfacts are sufficient. How did that bright star fall in with its black\r\nneighbors? Or were they created together?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 25.]\r\n\r\nPassing to the region covered by map No. 25, our eyes are caught by the\r\ncurious figure, formed by the five brightest stars of the constellation\r\nCassiopeia, somewhat resembling the letter W. Like Perseus, this is a\r\nrich constellation, both in star clusters and double stars. Among the\r\nlatter we select as our first example sigma, in which we find a\r\ncombination of color that is at once very unusual and very\r\nstriking--green and blue. The magnitudes are five and seven, distance\r\n3\", p. 324°. Another beautiful colored double is eta, whose magnitudes\r\nare four and seven and a half, distance 5\", p. 200°, colors white and\r\npurple. This is one of the comparatively small number of stars the\r\nmeasure of whose distance has been attempted, and a keen sense of the\r\nuncertainty of such measures is conveyed by the fact that authorities of\r\napparently equal weight place eta Cassiopeiæ at such discordant\r\ndistances as 124,000,000,000,000 miles, 70,000,000,000,000 miles, and\r\n42,000,000,000,000 miles. It will be observed that the difference\r\nbetween the greatest and the least of these estimates is about double\r\nthe entire distance given by the latter. The same thing is practically\r\ntrue of the various attempts to ascertain the distance of the other\r\nstars which have a perceptible parallax, even those which are evidently\r\nthe nearest. In some cases the later measures increase the distance, in\r\nother cases they diminish it; in no case is there anything like a\r\ncomplete accord. Yet of course we are not to infer that it is hopeless\r\nto learn anything about the distances of the stars. With all their\r\nuncertainties and disagreements the few parallaxes we possess have laid\r\na good foundation for a knowledge of the dimensions of at least the\r\nnearer parts of the universe.\r\n\r\nWe find an interesting triple in psi, the magnitudes of the larger\r\ncomponents being four and a half and eight and a half, distance 30\". The\r\nsmaller star has a nine-and-a-half-magnitude companion, distance 3\". A\r\nmore beautiful triple is iota, magnitudes four, seven, and eight,\r\ndistances 2\", p. 256°, and 7.5\", p. 112°. Cassiopeia contains many\r\nstar clusters, three of which are indicated in the map. Of these 392 is\r\nperhaps the most interesting, as it includes stars of many magnitudes,\r\namong which are a red one of the eighth magnitude, and a ninth-magnitude\r\ndouble whose components are 8\" apart. Not far from the star kappa we\r\nfind the spot where the most brilliant temporary star on record made its\r\nappearance on November 11, 1572. Tycho Brahe studied this phenomenon\r\nduring the entire period of its visibility, which lasted until March,\r\n1574. It burst out suddenly with overpowering splendor, far outshining\r\nevery fixed star, and even equaling Venus at her brightest. In a very\r\nshort time it began to fade, regularly diminishing in brightness, and at\r\nthe same time undergoing changes of color, ending in red, until it\r\ndisappeared. It has never been seen since, and the suspicion once\r\nentertained that it was a variable with a period considerably exceeding\r\nthree hundred years has not been confirmed. There is a tenth-magnitude\r\nstar near the place given by Tycho as that occupied by the stranger.\r\nMany other faint stars are scattered about, however, and Tycho's\r\nmeasures were not sufficiently exact to enable us to identify the\r\nprecise position of his star. If the phenomenon was due to a collision,\r\nno reappearance of the star is to be expected.\r\n\r\nCamelopardalus is a very inconspicuous constellation, yet it furnishes\r\nconsiderable occupation for the telescope. Sigma 390, of magnitude five,\r\nhas a companion of magnitude nine and a half, distance 15\", 160°. Sigma\r\n385, also of the fifth magnitude, has a ninth-magnitude companion,\r\ndistance only 2.4\", p. 160°. According to some observers, the larger\r\nstar is yellow and the smaller white. The star 1 is a very pretty\r\ndouble, magnitudes both six, distance 10.4\". Its neighbor 2 of magnitude\r\nsix has an eighth-magnitude companion, distance 1.7\", p. 278°. The star\r\n7 of magnitude five is also double, the companion of magnitude eight\r\nbeing distant only 1.2\". A glance at star cluster 940, which shows a\r\nslight central condensation, completes our work in Camelopardalus, and\r\nwe turn to Ursa Major, represented in map No. 26. Here there are many\r\ninteresting doubles and triples. Beginning with iota we find at once\r\noccupation for our largest glass. The magnitudes are three and ten,\r\ndistance 10\", p. 357°. In the double star 23 the magnitudes are four and\r\nnine, distance 23\", p. 272°. A more pleasing object is sigma^2, a\r\ngreenish fifth-magnitude star which has an eighth-magnitude companion,\r\ndistance 2.6\", p. 245°. A good double for our four-inch glass is xi,\r\nwhose magnitudes are four and five, distance 1.87\", p. 183°. This is a\r\nbinary with a period of revolution of about sixty years, and is\r\ninteresting as the first binary star whose orbit was determined. Savary\r\ncalculated it in 1828. Near by is nu, a difficult double, magnitudes\r\nfour and ten and a half, distance 7\", p. 147°. In 57 we find again an\r\neasy double magnitudes six and eight, distance 5.5\", p. 4°. Another\r\nsimilar double is 65, magnitudes six and eight, distance 3.9\", p. 38°. A\r\nthird star, magnitude seven, is seen at a distance of 114\" from the\r\nprimary.\r\n\r\nWe come now to Ursa Major's principal attraction zeta, frequently called\r\nMizar. The naked eye perceives near it a smaller star, named Alcor. With\r\nthe three-inch glass and a medium power we divide Mizar into two bright\r\nstars brilliantly contrasted in color, the larger being white and the\r\nsmaller blue-green. Beside Alcor, several fainter stars are seen\r\nscattered over the field of view, and, taken all in all, there are very\r\nfew equally beautiful sights in the starry heavens. The magnitudes of\r\nthe double are three and four, distance 14.5\", p. 148°. The large star\r\nis again double, although no telescope has been able to show it so, its\r\nduplicity being revealed, like that of beta Aurigæ, by the periodical\r\nsplitting of the lines in its spectrum.\r\n\r\nUrsa Major contains several nebulæ which may be glimpsed with telescopes\r\nof moderate dimensions. An interesting pair of these objects, both of\r\nwhich are included in one field of view, is formed by 1949 and 1950. The\r\nfirst named is the brighter of the two, its nucleus resembling a faint\r\nstar. The nebula 2343 presents itself to us in the form of a faint, hazy\r\nstar, but with large telescopes its appearance is very singular.\r\nAccording to a picture made by Lord Rosse, it bears no little\r\nresemblance to a skull, there being two symmetrically placed holes in\r\nit, each of which contains a star.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP NO. 26.]\r\n\r\nThe portion of Canes Venatici, represented in map No. 26, contains two\r\nor three remarkable objects. Sigma 1606 is a close double, magnitudes\r\nsix and seven, distance 1\", p. 336°. It is a pretty sight with the\r\nfive-inch. The double star 2 is singular in that its larger component is\r\nred and its smaller blue; magnitudes six and eight, distance 11.4\", p.\r\n260°. Still more beautiful is 12, commonly called Cor Caroli. This\r\ndouble is wide, and requires but a slight magnifying power. The\r\nmagnitudes are three and six, distance 20\", colors white or light yellow\r\nand blue. The nebula 3572, although we can see it only as a pair of\r\nmisty specks, is in reality a very wonderful object. Lord Rosse's\r\ntelescope has revealed in it a complicated spiral structure, recalling\r\nthe photographs of the Andromeda nebula, and indicating that stupendous\r\nchanges must be in process within it, although our records of\r\nobservation are necessarily too brief to bring out any perceptible\r\nalteration of figure. It would seem that the astronomer has, of all men,\r\nthe best reasons for complaining of the brevity of human life.\r\n\r\nLastly, we turn to Ursa Minor and the Pole Star. The latter is a\r\ncelebrated double, not difficult, except with a telescope of less than\r\nthree inches aperture in the hands of an inexperienced observer. The\r\nmagnitudes are two and nine, distance 18.5\". The small star has a dull\r\nblue color. In 1899 it was discovered by spectroscopic evidence that the\r\nPole Star is triple. In pi' we see a wide double, magnitudes six and\r\nseven, distance 30\", p. 83°.\r\n\r\nThis completes our survey of the starry heavens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENES ON THE PLANETS\r\n\r\n    \"These starry globes far surpassed the earth in grandeur, and the\r\n    latter looked so diminutive that our empire, which appeared only as\r\n    a point on its surface, awoke my pity.\"--CICERO, THE DREAM OF\r\n    SCIPIO.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough amateurs have played a conspicuous part in telescopic discovery\r\namong the heavenly bodies, yet every owner of a small telescope should\r\nnot expect to attach his name to a star. But he certainly can do\r\nsomething perhaps more useful to himself and his friends; he can follow\r\nthe discoveries that others, with better appliances and opportunities,\r\nhave made, and can thus impart to those discoveries that sense of\r\nreality which only comes from seeing things with one's own eyes. There\r\nare hundreds of things continually referred to in books and writings on\r\nastronomy which have but a misty and uncertain significance for the mere\r\nreader, but which he can easily verify for himself with the aid of a\r\ntelescope of four or five inches aperture, and which, when actually\r\nconfronted by the senses, assume a meaning, a beauty, and an importance\r\nthat would otherwise entirely have escaped him. Henceforth every\r\nallusion to the objects he has seen is eloquent with intelligence and\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nTake, for instance, the planets that have been the subject of so many\r\nobservations and speculations of late years--Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,\r\nVenus. For the ordinary reader much that is said about them makes very\r\nlittle impression upon his mind, and is almost unintelligible. He reads\r\nof the \"snow patches\" on Mars, but unless he has actually seen the\r\nwhitened poles of that planet he can form no clear image in his mind of\r\nwhat is meant. So the \"belts of Jupiter\" is a confusing and misleading\r\nphrase for almost everybody except the astronomer, and the rings of\r\nSaturn are beyond comprehension unless they have actually been seen.\r\n\r\nIt is true that pictures and photographs partially supply the place of\r\nobservation, but by no means so successfully as many imagine. The most\r\nrealistic drawings and the sharpest photographs in astronomy are those\r\nof the moon, yet I think nobody would maintain that any picture in\r\nexistence is capable of imparting a really satisfactory visual\r\nimpression of the appearance of the lunar globe. Nobody who has not seen\r\nthe moon with a telescope--it need not be a large one--can form a\r\ncorrect and definite idea of what the moon is like.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction of viewing with one's own eyes some of the things the\r\nastronomers write and talk about is very great, and the illumination\r\nthat comes from such viewing is equally great. Just as in foreign travel\r\nthe actual seeing of a famous city, a great gallery filled with\r\nmasterpieces, or a battlefield where decisive issues have been fought\r\nout illuminates, for the traveler's mind, the events of history, the\r\ncriticisms of artists, and the occurrences of contemporary life in\r\nforeign lands, so an acquaintance with the sights of the heavens gives a\r\ngrasp on astronomical problems that can not be acquired in any other\r\nway. The person who has been in Rome, though he may be no archæologist,\r\ngets a far more vivid conception of a new discovery in the Forum than\r\ndoes the reader who has never seen the city of the Seven Hills; and the\r\namateur who has looked at Jupiter with a telescope, though he may be no\r\nastronomer, finds that the announcement of some change among the\r\nwonderful belts of that cloudy planet has for him a meaning and an\r\ninterest in which the ordinary reader can not share.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUPITER SEEN WITH A FIVE-INCH TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nShadow of a satellite visible.]\r\n\r\nJupiter is perhaps the easiest of all the planets for the amateur\r\nobserver. A three-inch telescope gives beautiful views of the great\r\nplanet, although a four-inch or a five-inch is of course better. But\r\nthere is no necessity for going beyond six inches' aperture in any case.\r\nFor myself, I should care for nothing better than my Byrne five-inch of\r\nfifty-two inches' focal distance. With such a glass more details are\r\nvisible in the dark belts and along the bright equatorial girdle than\r\ncan be correctly represented in a sketch before the rotation of the\r\nplanet has altered their aspect, while the shadows of the satellites\r\nthrown upon the broad disk, and the satellites themselves when in\r\ntransit, can be seen sometimes with exquisite clearness. The contrasting\r\ncolors of various parts of the disk are also easily studied with a glass\r\nof four or five inches' aperture.\r\n\r\nThere is a charm about the great planet when he rides high in a clear\r\nevening sky, lording it over the fixed stars with his serene,\r\nunflickering luminousness, which no possessor of a telescope can resist.\r\nYou turn the glass upon him and he floats into the field of view, with\r\nhis _cortége_ of satellites, like a yellow-and-red moon, attended by\r\nfour miniatures of itself. You instantly comprehend Jupiter's mastery\r\nover his satellites--their allegiance is evident. No one would for an\r\ninstant mistake them for stars accidentally seen in the same field of\r\nview. Although it requires a very large telescope to magnify their disks\r\nto measurable dimensions, yet the smallest glass differentiates them at\r\nonce from the fixed stars. There is something almost startling in their\r\nappearance of companionship with the huge planet--this sudden\r\nverification to your eyes of the laws of gravitation and of central\r\nforces. It is easy, while looking at Jupiter amid his family, to\r\nunderstand the consternation of the churchmen when Galileo's telescope\r\nrevealed that miniature of the solar system, and it is gratifying to\r\ngaze upon one of the first battle grounds whereon science gained a\r\ndecisive victory for truth.\r\n\r\nThe swift changing of place among the satellites, as well as the\r\nrapidity of Jupiter's axial rotation, give the attraction of visible\r\nmovement to the Jovian spectacle. The planet rotates in four or five\r\nminutes less than ten hours--in other words, it makes two turns and four\r\ntenths of a third turn while the earth is rolling once upon its axis. A\r\npoint on Jupiter's equator moves about twenty-seven thousand miles, or\r\nconsiderably more than the entire circumference of the earth, in a\r\nsingle hour. The effect of this motion is clearly perceptible to the\r\nobserver with a telescope on account of the diversified markings and\r\ncolors of the moving disk, and to watch it is one of the greatest\r\npleasures that the telescope affords.\r\n\r\nIt would be possible, when the planet is favorably situated, to witness\r\nan entire rotation of Jupiter in the course of one night, but the\r\nbeginning and end of the observation would be more or less interfered\r\nwith by the effects of low altitude, to say nothing of the tedium of so\r\nlong a vigil. But by looking at the planet for an hour at a time in the\r\ncourse of a few nights every side of it will have been presented to\r\nview. Suppose the first observation is made between nine and ten o'clock\r\non any night which may have been selected. Then on the following night\r\nbetween ten and eleven o'clock Jupiter will have made two and a half\r\nturns upon his axis, and the side diametrically opposite to that seen on\r\nthe first night will be visible. On the third night between eleven and\r\ntwelve o'clock Jupiter will have performed five complete rotations, and\r\nthe side originally viewed will be visible again.\r\n\r\nOwing to the rotundity of the planet, only the central part of the disk\r\nis sharply defined, and markings which can be easily seen when centrally\r\nlocated become indistinct or disappear altogether when near the limb.\r\nApproach to the edge of the disk also causes a foreshortening which\r\nsometimes entirely alters the aspect of a marking. It is advisable,\r\ntherefore, to confine the attention mainly to the middle of the disk. As\r\ntime passes, clearly defined markings on or between the cloudy belts\r\nwill be seen to approach the western edge of the disk, gradually losing\r\ntheir distinctness and altering their appearance, while from the region\r\nof indistinct definition near the eastern edge other markings slowly\r\nemerge and advance toward the center, becoming sharper in outline and\r\nmore clearly defined in color as they swing into view.\r\n\r\nWatching these changes, the observer is carried away by the reflection\r\nthat he actually sees the turning of another distant world upon its axis\r\nof rotation, just as he might view the revolving earth from a standpoint\r\non the moon. Belts of reddish clouds, many thousands of miles across,\r\nare stretched along on each side of the equator of the great planet he\r\nis watching; the equatorial belt itself, brilliantly lemon-hued, or\r\nsometimes ruddy, is diversified with white globular and balloon-shaped\r\nmasses, which almost recall the appearance of summer cloud domes hanging\r\nover a terrestrial landscape, while toward the poles shadowy expanses of\r\ngradually deepening blue or blue-gray suggest the comparative coolness\r\nof those regions which lie always under a low sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ECLIPSES AND TRANSITS OF JUPITER'S SATELLITES.\r\n\r\nSatellite I and the shadow of III are seen in transit. IV is about to be\r\neclipsed.]\r\n\r\nAfter a few nights' observation even the veriest amateur finds himself\r\nrecognizing certain shapes or appearances--a narrow dark belt running\r\nslopingly across the equator from one of the main cloud zones to the\r\nother, or a rift in one of the colored bands, or a rotund white mass\r\napparently floating above the equator, or a broad scallop in the edge of\r\na belt like that near the site of the celebrated \"red spot,\" whose\r\nchanges of color and aspect since its first appearance in 1878, together\r\nwith the light it has thrown on the constitution of Jupiter's disk, have\r\nall but created a new Jovian literature, so thoroughly and so frequently\r\nhave they been discussed.\r\n\r\nAnd, having noticed these recurring features, the observer will begin to\r\nnote their relations to one another, and will thus be led to observe\r\nthat some of them gradually drift apart, while others drift nearer; and\r\nafter a time, without any aid from books or hints from observatories, he\r\nwill discover for himself that there is a law governing the movements on\r\nJupiter's disk. Upon the whole he will find that the swiftest motions\r\nare near the equator, and the slowest near the poles, although, if he is\r\npersistent and has a good eye and a good instrument, he will note\r\nexceptions to this rule, probably arising, as Professor Hough suggests,\r\nfrom differences of altitude in Jupiter's atmosphere. Finally, he will\r\nconclude that the colossal globe before him is, exteriorly at least, a\r\nvast ball of clouds and vapors, subject to tremendous vicissitudes,\r\npossibly intensely heated, and altogether different in its physical\r\nconstitution, although made up of similar elements, from the earth.\r\nThen, if he chooses, he can sail off into the delightful cloud-land of\r\nastronomical speculation, and make of the striped and spotted sphere of\r\nJove just such a world as may please his fancy--for a world of some\r\nkind it certainly is.\r\n\r\nFor many observers the satellites of Jupiter possess even greater\r\nattractions than the gigantic ball itself. As I have already remarked,\r\ntheir movements are very noticeable and lend a wonderful animation to\r\nthe scene. Although they bear classical names, they are almost\r\nuniversally referred to by their Roman numbers, beginning with the\r\ninnermost, whose symbol is I, and running outward in regular order II,\r\nIII, and IV.[5] The minute satellite much nearer to the planet than any\r\nof the others, which Mr. Barnard discovered with the Lick telescope in\r\n1892, is called the fifth, although in the order of distance it would be\r\nthe first. In size and importance, however, it can not rank with its\r\ncomparatively gigantic brothers. Of course, no amateur's telescope can\r\nafford the faintest glimpse of it.\r\n\r\n[5] Their names, in the same order as their numbers, are Io, Europa,\r\nGanymede, and Callisto.\r\n\r\nSatellite I, situated at a mean distance of 261,000 miles from Jupiter's\r\ncenter--about 22,000 miles farther than the moon is from the earth--is\r\nurged by its master's overpowering attraction to a speed of 320 miles\r\nper minute, so that it performs a complete revolution in about forty-two\r\nhours and a half. The others, of course, move more slowly, but even the\r\nmost distant performs its revolution in several hours less than sixteen\r\ndays. The plane of their orbits is presented edgewise toward the earth,\r\nfrom which it follows that they appear to move back and forth nearly in\r\nstraight lines, some apparently approaching the planet, while others are\r\nreceding from it. The changes in their relative positions, which can be\r\ndetected from hour to hour, are very striking night after night, and\r\nlead to a great variety of arrangements always pleasing to the eye.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting phenomena that they present are their transits and\r\nthose of their round, black shadows across the face of the planet; their\r\neclipses by the planet's shadow, when they disappear and afterward\r\nreappear with astonishing suddenness; and their occultations by the\r\nglobe of Jupiter. Upon the whole, the most interesting thing for the\r\namateur to watch is the passage of the shadows across Jupiter. The\r\ndistinctness with which they can be seen when the air is steady is\r\nlikely to surprise, as it is certain to delight, the observer. When it\r\nfalls upon a light part of the disk the shadow of a satellite is as\r\nblack and sharply outlined as a drop of ink; on a dark-colored belt it\r\ncan not so easily be seen.\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to see the satellites themselves in transit. There\r\nappears to be some difference among them as to visibility in such\r\ncircumstances. Owing to their luminosity they are best seen when they\r\nhave a dark belt for a background, and are least easily visible when\r\nthey appear against a bright portion of the planet. Every observer\r\nshould provide himself with a copy of the American Ephemeris for the\r\ncurrent year, wherein he will find all the information needed to enable\r\nhim to identify the various satellites and to predict, by turning\r\nWashington mean time into his own local time, the various phenomena of\r\nthe transits and eclipses.\r\n\r\nWhile a faithful study of the phenomena of Jupiter is likely to lead the\r\nstudent to the conclusion that the greatest planet in our system is not\r\na suitable abode for life, yet the problem of its future, always\r\nfascinating to the imagination, is open; and whosoever may be disposed\r\nto record his observations in a systematic manner may at least hope to\r\nrender aid in the solution of that problem.\r\n\r\nSaturn ranks next to Jupiter in attractiveness for the observer with a\r\ntelescope. The rings are almost as mystifying to-day as they were in\r\nthe time of Herschel. There is probably no single telescopic view that\r\ncan compare in the power to excite wonder with that of Saturn when the\r\nring system is not so widely opened but that both poles of the planet\r\nproject beyond it. One returns to it again and again with unflagging\r\ninterest, and the beauty of the spectacle quite matches its singularity.\r\nWhen Saturn is in view the owner of a telescope may become a recruiting\r\nofficer for astronomy by simply inviting his friends to gaze at the\r\nwonderful planet. The silvery color of the ball, delicately chased with\r\nhalf-visible shadings, merging one into another from the bright\r\nequatorial band to the bluish polar caps; the grand arch of the rings,\r\nsweeping across the planet with a perceptible edging of shadow; their\r\nsudden disappearance close to the margin of the ball, where they go\r\nbehind it and fall straightway into night; the manifest contrast of\r\nbrightness, if not of color, between the two principal rings; the fine\r\ncurve of the black line marking the 1,600-mile gap between their\r\nedges--these are some of the elements of a picture that can never fade\r\nfrom the memory of any one who has once beheld it in its full glory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SATURN SEEN WITH A FIVE-INCH TELESCOPE.]\r\n\r\nSaturn's moons are by no means so interesting to watch as are those of\r\nJupiter. Even the effect of their surprising number (raised to nine by\r\nProfessor Pickering's discovery in 1899 of a new one which is almost at\r\nthe limit of visibility, and was found only with the aid of photography)\r\nis lost, because most of them are too faint to be seen with ordinary\r\ntelescopes, or, if seen, to make any notable impression upon the eye.\r\nThe two largest--Titan and Japetus--are easily found, and Titan is\r\nconspicuous, but they give none of that sense of companionship and\r\nobedience to a central authority which strikes even the careless\r\nobserver of Jupiter's system. This is owing partly to their more\r\ndeliberate movements and partly to the inclination of the plane of their\r\norbits, which seldom lies edgewise toward the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POLAR VIEW OF SATURN'S SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe orbits of the five nearest satellites are shown. The dotted line\r\noutside the rings shows Roche's limit.]\r\n\r\nBut the charm of the peerless rings is abiding, and the interest of the\r\nspectator is heightened by recalling what science has recently\r\nestablished as to their composition. It is marvelous to think, while\r\nlooking upon their broad, level surfaces--as smooth, apparently, as\r\npolished steel, though thirty thousand miles across--that they are in\r\nreality vast circling currents of meteoritic particles or dust, through\r\nwhich run immense waves, condensation and rarefaction succeeding one\r\nanother as in the undulations of sound. Yet, with all their inferential\r\ntumult, they may actually be as soundless as the depths of interstellar\r\nspace, for Struve has shown that those spectacular rings possess no\r\nappreciable mass, and, viewed from Saturn itself, their (to us) gorgeous\r\nseeming bow may appear only as a wreath of shimmering vapor spanning the\r\nsky and paled by the rivalry of the brighter stars.\r\n\r\nIn view of the theory of tidal action disrupting a satellite within a\r\ncritical distance from the center of its primary, the thoughtful\r\nobserver of Saturn will find himself wondering what may have been the\r\norigin of the rings. The critical distance referred to, and which is\r\nknown as Roche's limit, lies, according to the most trustworthy\r\nestimates, just outside the outermost edge of the rings. It follows that\r\nif the matter composing the rings were collected into a single body that\r\nbody would inevitably be torn to pieces and scattered into rings; and\r\nso, too, if instead of one there were several or many bodies of\r\nconsiderable size occupying the place of the rings, all of these bodies\r\nwould be disrupted and scattered. If one of the present moons of\r\nSaturn--for instance, Mimas, the innermost hitherto discovered--should\r\nwander within the magic circle of Roche's limit it would suffer a\r\nsimilar fate, and its particles would be disseminated among the rings.\r\nOne can hardly help wondering whether the rings have originated from the\r\ndemolition of satellites--Saturn devouring his children, as the ancient\r\nmyths represent, and encircling himself, amid the fury of destruction,\r\nwith the dust of his disintegrated victims. At any rate, the amateur\r\nstudent of Saturn will find in the revelations of his telescope the\r\ninspirations of poetry as well as those of science, and the bent of his\r\nmind will determine which he shall follow.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pickering's discovery of a ninth satellite of Saturn, situated\r\nat the great distance of nearly eight million miles from the planet,\r\nserves to call attention to the vastness of the \"sphere of activity\"\r\nover which the ringed planet reigns. Surprising as the distance of the\r\nnew satellite appears when compared with that of our moon, it is yet far\r\nfrom the limit where Saturn's control ceases and that of the sun becomes\r\npredominant. That limit, according to Prof. Asaph Hall's calculation, is\r\nnearly 30,000,000 miles from Saturn's center, while if our moon were\r\nremoved to a distance a little exceeding 500,000 miles the earth would\r\nbe in danger of losing its satellite through the elopement of Artemis\r\nwith Apollo.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as already remarked, the satellites of Saturn are not\r\nespecially interesting to the amateur telescopist, yet it may be well to\r\nmention that, in addition to Titan and Japetus, the satellite named\r\nRhea, the fifth in order of distance from the planet, is not a difficult\r\nobject for a three-or four-inch telescope, and two others considerably\r\nfainter than Rhea--Dione (the fourth) and Tethys (the third)--may be\r\nseen in favorable circumstances. The others--Mimas (the first),\r\nEnceladus (the second), and Hyperion (the seventh)--are beyond the reach\r\nof all but large telescopes. The ninth satellite, which has received the\r\nname of Ph[oe]be, is much fainter than any of the others, its stellar\r\nmagnitude being reckoned by its discoverer at about 15.5.\r\n\r\nMars, the best advertised of all the planets, is nearly the least\r\nsatisfactory to look at except during a favorable opposition, like those\r\nof 1877 and 1892, when its comparative nearness to the earth renders\r\nsome of its characteristic features visible in a small telescope. The\r\nnext favorable opposition will occur in 1907.\r\n\r\nWhen well seen with an ordinary telescope, say a four-or five-inch\r\nglass, Mars shows three peculiarities that may be called fairly\r\nconspicuous--viz., its white polar cap, its general reddish, or\r\norange-yellow, hue, and its dark markings, one of the clearest of which\r\nis the so-called Syrtis Major, or, as it was once named on account of\r\nits shape, \"Hourglass Sea.\" Other dark expanses in the southern\r\nhemisphere are not difficult to be seen, although their outlines are\r\nmore or less misty and indistinct. The gradual diminution of the polar\r\ncap, which certainly behaves in this respect as a mass of snow and ice\r\nwould do, is a most interesting spectacle. As summer advances in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere of Mars, the white circular patch surrounding the\r\npole becomes smaller, night after night, until it sometimes disappears\r\nentirely even from the ken of the largest telescopes. At the same time\r\nthe dark expanses become more distinct, as if the melting of the polar\r\nsnows had supplied them with a greater depth of water, or the advance of\r\nthe season had darkened them with a heavier growth of vegetation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARS SEEN WITH A FIVE-INCH TELESCOPE.]\r\n\r\nThe phenomena mentioned above are about all that a small telescope will\r\nreveal. Occasionally a dark streak, which large instruments show is\r\nconnected with the mysterious system of \"canals,\" can be detected, but\r\nthe \"canals\" themselves are far beyond the reach of any telescope except\r\na few of the giants handled by experienced observers. The conviction\r\nwhich seems to have forced its way into the minds even of some\r\nconservative astronomers, that on Mars the conditions, to use the\r\nexpression of Professor Young, \"are more nearly earthlike than on any\r\nother of the heavenly bodies which we can see with our present\r\ntelescopes,\" is sufficient to make the planet a center of undying\r\ninterest notwithstanding the difficulties with which the amateur is\r\nconfronted in his endeavors to see the details of its markings.\r\n\r\nTHE ILLUMINATION OF VENUS'S ATMOSPHERE AT THE BEGINNING OF HER TRANSIT\r\nACROSS THE SUN.\r\n\r\nIn Venus \"the fatal gift of beauty\" may be said, as far as our\r\nobservations are concerned, to be matched by the equally fatal gift of\r\nbrilliance. Whether it be due to atmospheric reflection alone or to the\r\nprevalence of clouds, Venus is so bright that considerable doubt exists\r\nas to the actual visibility of any permanent markings on her surface.\r\nThe detailed representations of the disk of Venus by Mr. Percival\r\nLowell, showing in some respects a resemblance to the stripings of Mars,\r\ncan not yet be accepted as decisive. More experienced astronomers than\r\nMr. Lowell have been unable to see at all things which he draws with a\r\nfearless and unhesitating pencil. That there are some shadowy features\r\nof the planet's surface to be seen in favourable circumstances is\r\nprobable, but the time for drawing a \"map of Venus\" has not yet come.\r\n\r\nThe previous work of Schiaparelli lends a certain degree of probability\r\nto Mr. Lowell's observations on the rotation of Venus. This rotation,\r\naccording to the original announcement of Schiaparelli, is probably\r\nperformed in the same period as the revolution around the sun. In other\r\nwords, Venus, if Schiaparelli and Lowell are right, always presents the\r\nsame side to the sun, possessing, in consequence, a day hemisphere and a\r\nnight hemisphere which never interchange places. This condition is so\r\nantagonistic to all our ideas of what constitutes habitability for a\r\nplanet that one hesitates to accept it as proved, and almost hopes that\r\nit may turn out to have no real existence. Venus, as the twin of the\r\nearth in size, is a planet which the imagination, warmed by its sunny\r\naspect, would fain people with intelligent beings a little fairer than\r\nourselves; but how can such ideas be reconciled with the picture of a\r\nworld one half of which is subjected to the merciless rays of a\r\nnever-setting sun, while the other half is buried in the fearful gloom\r\nand icy chill of unending night?\r\n\r\nAny amateur observer who wishes to test his eyesight and his telescope\r\nin the search of shades or markings on the disk of Venus by the aid of\r\nwhich the question of its rotation may finally be settled should do his\r\nwork while the sun is still above the horizon. Schiaparelli adopted that\r\nplan years ago, and others have followed him with advantage. The\r\ndiffused light of day serves to take off the glare which is so serious\r\nan obstacle to the successful observation of Venus when seen against a\r\ndark sky. Knowing the location of Venus in the sky, which can be\r\nascertained from the Ephemeris, the observer can find it by day. If his\r\ntelescope is not permanently mounted and provided with \"circles\" this\r\nmay not prove an easy thing to do, yet a little perseverance and\r\ningenuity will effect it. One way is to find, with a star chart, some\r\nstar whose declination is the same, or very nearly the same, as that of\r\nVenus, and which crosses the meridian say twelve hours ahead of her.\r\nThen set the telescope upon that star, when it is on the meridian at\r\nnight, and leave it there, and the next day, twelve hours after the star\r\ncrossed the meridian, look into your telescope and you will see Venus,\r\nor, if not, a slight motion of the tube will bring her into view.\r\n\r\nFor many amateurs the phases of Venus will alone supply sufficient\r\ninterest for telescopic observation. The changes in her form, from that\r\nof a round full moon when she is near superior conjunction to the\r\ngibbous, and finally the half-moon phase as she approaches her eastern\r\nelongation, followed by the gradually narrowing and lengthening\r\ncrescent, until she is a mere silver sickle between the sun and the\r\nearth, form a succession of delightful pictures.\r\n\r\nNot very much can be said for Mercury as a telescopic object. The little\r\nplanet presents phases like those of Venus, and, according to\r\nSchiaparelli and Lowell, it resembles Venus in its rotation, keeping\r\nalways the same side to the sun. In fact, Schiaparelli's discovery of\r\nthis peculiarity in the case of Mercury preceded the similar discovery\r\nin the case of Venus. There are markings on Mercury which have reminded\r\nsome astronomers of the moon, and there are reasons for thinking that\r\nthe planet can not be a suitable abode for living beings, at least for\r\nbeings resembling the inhabitants of the earth.\r\n\r\nUranus and Neptune are too far away to present any attraction for\r\namateur observers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE MOUNTAINS AND PLAINS OF THE MOON, AND THE SPECTACLES OF THE SUN\r\n\r\n                \"... the Moon, whose orb\r\nThe Tuscan artist views through optic glass\r\nAt evening from the top of Fesolé,\r\nOr in Valdarno, to descry new lands,\r\nRivers or mountains in her spotty globe.\"--PARADISE LOST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moon is probably the most interesting of all telescopic objects.\r\nThis arises from its comparative nearness to the earth. A telescope\r\nmagnifying 1,000 diameters brings the moon within an apparent distance\r\nof less than 240 miles. If telescopes are ever made with a magnifying\r\npower of 10,000 diameters, then, provided that atmospheric difficulties\r\ncan be overcome, we shall see the moon as if it were only about twenty\r\nmiles off, and a sensitive astronomer might be imagined to feel a little\r\nhesitation about gazing so closely at the moon--as if he were peering\r\ninto a neighbor world's window.\r\n\r\nBut a great telescope and a high magnifying power are not required to\r\ninterest the amateur astronomer in the study of the moon. Our three-inch\r\ntelescope is amply sufficient to furnish us with entertainment for many\r\nan evening while the moon is running through its phases, and we shall\r\nfind delight in frequently changing the magnifying power as we watch the\r\nlunar landscapes, because every change will present them in a different\r\naspect.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that a telescope, unless a terrestrial eyepiece\r\nor prism is employed, reverses such an object as the moon top for\r\nbottom. Accordingly, if the moon is on or near the meridian when the\r\nobservations are made, we shall see the north polar region at the bottom\r\nand the south polar region at the top. In other words, the face of the\r\nmoon as presented in the telescope will be upside down, north and south\r\ninterchanging places as compared with their positions in a geographical\r\nmap. But east and west remain unaltered in position, as compared with\r\nsuch a map--i. e., the eastern hemisphere of the moon is seen on the\r\nright and the western hemisphere on the left. It is the moon's western\r\nedge that catches the first sunlight when \"new moon\" begins, and, as the\r\nphase increases, passing into \"first quarter\" and from that to \"full\r\nmoon,\" the illumination sweeps across the disk from west to east.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUNAR CHART NO. 1, NORTHWEST QUARTER.]\r\n\r\nThe narrow sickle of the new moon, hanging above the sunset, is a\r\ncharming telescopic sight. Use a low power, and observe the contrast\r\nbetween the bright, smooth round of the sunward edge, which has almost\r\nthe polish of a golden rim, and the irregular and delicately shaded\r\ninner curve, where the adjacent mountains and plains picturesquely\r\nreflect or subdue the sunshine. While the crescent grows broader new\r\nobjects are continually coming into view as the sun rises upon them,\r\nuntil at length one of the most conspicuous and remarkable of the lunar\r\n\"seas,\" the _Mare Crisium_, or Sea of Crises, lies fully displayed amid\r\nits encircling peaks, precipices, and craters. The _Mare Crisium_ is all\r\nin the sunlight between the third and fourth day after \"new moon.\" It is\r\nabout 350 by 280 miles in extent, and if ever filled with water must\r\nhave been a very deep sea, since its arid bed lies at a great but not\r\nprecisely ascertained depth below the general level of the moon. There\r\nare a few small craters on the floor of the _Mare Crisium_, the largest\r\nbearing the name of Picard, and its borders are rugged with mountains.\r\nOn the southwestern side is a lofty promontory, 11,000 feet in height,\r\ncalled Cape Agarum. At the middle of the eastern side a kind of bay\r\nopens deep in the mountains, whose range here becomes very narrow.\r\nSoutheast of this bay lies a conspicuous bright point, the crater\r\nmountain Proclus, on which the sun has fully risen in the fourth day of\r\nthe moon, and which reflects the light with extraordinary liveliness.\r\nAdjoining Proclus on the east and south is a curious, lozenge-shaped\r\nflat, broken with short, low ridges, and possessing a most peculiar\r\nlight-brown tint, easily distinguished from the general color tone of\r\nthe lunar landscapes. It would be interesting to know what was passing\r\nin the mind of the old astronomer who named this singular region _Palus\r\nSomnii_. It is not the only spot on the moon which has been called a\r\n\"marsh,\" and to which an unexplained connection with dreams has been\r\nascribed.\r\n\r\nNearly on the same meridian with Proclus, at a distance of about a\r\nhundred miles northward, lies a fine example of a ring mountain, rather\r\nmore than forty miles in diameter, and with peak-tipped walls which in\r\nsome places are 13,000 feet in height, as measured from the floor\r\nwithin. This is Macrobius. There is an inconspicuous central mountain in\r\nthe ring.\r\n\r\nNorth of the _Mare Crisium_, and northwest of Macrobius, we find a much\r\nlarger mountain ring, oblong in shape and nearly eighty miles in its\r\ngreatest diameter. It is named Cleomenes. The highest point on its wall\r\nis about 10,000 feet above the interior. Near the northeast corner of\r\nthe wall yawns a huge and very deep crater, Tralles, while at the\r\nnorthern end is another oblong crater mountain called Burckhardt.\r\n\r\nFrom Cleomenes northward to the pole, or to the northern extremity of\r\nthe crescent, if our observations are made during new moon, the ground\r\nappears broken with an immense number of ridges, craters, and mountain\r\nrings, among which we may telescopically wander at will. One of the more\r\nremarkable of these objects, which may be identified with the aid of\r\nLunar Chart No. 1, is the vast ringed plain near the edge of the disk,\r\nnamed Gauss. It is more than a hundred and ten miles in diameter. Owing\r\nto its situation, so far down the side of the lunar globe, it is\r\nforeshortened into a long ellipse, although in reality it is nearly a\r\ncircle. A chain of mountains runs north and south across the interior\r\nplain. Geminus, Berzelius, and Messala are other rings well worth\r\nlooking at. The remarkable pair called Atlas and Hercules demand more\r\nthan passing attention. The former is fifty-five and the latter\r\nforty-six miles in diameter. Each sinks 11,000 feet below the summit of\r\nthe loftiest peak on its encircling wall. Both are full of interesting\r\ndetail sufficient to occupy the careful observer for many nights. The\r\nbroad ring bearing the name of Endymion is nearly eighty miles in\r\ndiameter, and has one peak 15,000 feet high. The interior plain is flat\r\nand dark. Beyond Endymion on the edge of the disk is part of a gloomy\r\nplain called the _Mare Humboltianum_.\r\n\r\nAfter glancing at the crater-shaped mountains on the western and\r\nsouthern border of the _Mare Crisium_, Alhazen, Hansen, Condorcet,\r\nFirmicus, etc., we pass southward into the area covered in Lunar Chart\r\nNo. 2. The long dark plain south of the _Mare Crisium_ is the _Mare\r\nFecunditatis_, though why it should have been supposed to be\r\nparticularly fecund, or fertile, is by no means clear. On the western\r\nborder of this plain, about three hundred miles from the southern end of\r\nthe _Mare Crisium_, is the mountain ring, or circumvallation, called\r\nLangrenus, about ninety miles across and in places 10,000 feet high.\r\nThere is a fine central mountain with a number of peaks. Nearly a\r\nhundred miles farther south, on the same meridian, lies an equally\r\nextensive mountain ring named Vendelinus. The broken and complicated\r\nappearance of its northern walls will command the observer's attention.\r\nAnother similar step southward, and still on the same meridian brings us\r\nto a yet finer mountain ring, slightly larger than the others, and still\r\nmore complicated in its walls, peaks, and terraces, and in its\r\nsurroundings of craters, gorges, and broken ridges. This is Petavius.\r\nWest of Petavius, on the very edge of the disk, is a wonderful\r\nformation, a walled plain named Humboldt, which is looked down upon at\r\none point near its eastern edge by a peak 16,000 feet in height. About a\r\nhundred and forty miles south of Petavius is the fourth great mountain\r\nring lying on the same meridian. Its name is Furnerius. Look\r\nparticularly at the brilliantly shining crater on the northeast slope of\r\nthe outer wall of Furnerius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUNAR CHART NO. 2, SOUTHWEST QUARTER.]\r\n\r\nSuppose that our observations are now interrupted, to be resumed when\r\nthe moon, about \"seven days old,\" is in its first quarter. If we had\r\ntime, it would be a most interesting thing to watch the advance of the\r\nlunar sunrise every night, for new beauties are displayed almost from\r\nhour to hour; but, for the purposes of our description it is necessary\r\nto curtail the observations. At first quarter one half of the lunar\r\nhemisphere which faces the earth is illuminated by the sun, and the line\r\nof sunrise runs across some of the most wonderful regions of the moon.\r\n\r\nWe begin, referring once more to Lunar Chart No. 1, in the neighborhood\r\nof the north pole of the moon. Here the line along which day and night\r\nmeet is twisted and broken, owing to the roughness of the lunar surface.\r\nAbout fifteen degrees southwest of the pole lies a remarkable\r\nsquare-cornered, mountain-bordered plain, about forty miles in length,\r\ncalled Barrow. Very close to the pole is a ring mountain, about\r\ntwenty-five miles in diameter, whose two loftiest peaks, 8,000 to 9,000\r\nfeet high, according to Neison, must, from their situation, enjoy\r\nperpetual day.\r\n\r\nThe long, narrow, dark plain, whose nearest edge is about thirty degrees\r\nsouth of the pole, is the _Mare Frigoris_, bordered on both sides by\r\nuplands and mountains. At its southern edge we find the magnificent\r\nAristoteles, a mountain ring, sixty miles across, whose immense wall is\r\ncomposed of terraces and ridges running up to lofty peaks, which rise\r\nnearly 11,000 feet above the floor of the valley. About a hundred miles\r\nsouth of Aristoteles is Eudoxus, another fine mountain ring, forty miles\r\nin diameter, and quite as deep as its northern neighbor. These two make\r\na most striking spectacle.\r\n\r\nWe are now in the neighborhood of the greatest mountain chains on the\r\nmoon, the lunar Alps lying to the east and the lunar Caucasus to the\r\nsouth of Aristoteles and Eudoxus, while still farther south, separated\r\nfrom the Caucasus by a strait not more than a hundred miles broad,\r\nbegins the mighty range of the lunar Apennines. We first turn the\r\ntelescope on the Alps. As the line of sunrise runs directly across their\r\nhighest peaks, the effect is startling. The greatest elevations are\r\nabout 12,000 feet. The observer's eye is instantly caught by a great\r\nvalley, running like a furrow through the center of the mountain mass,\r\nand about eighty or ninety miles in length. The sealike expanse south\r\nand southeast of the Alps is the _Mare Imbrium_, and it is along the\r\ncoast of this so-called sea that the Alps attain their greatest height.\r\nThe valley, or gorge, above mentioned, appears to cut through the\r\nloftiest mountains and to reach the \"coast,\" although it is so narrowed\r\nand broken among the greater peaks that its southern portion is almost\r\nlost before it actually reaches the _Mare Imbrium_. Opening wider again\r\nas it enters the _Mare_, it forms a deep bay among precipitous\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThe Caucasus Mountains are not so lofty nor so precipitous as the Alps,\r\nand consequently have less attraction for the observer. They border the\r\ndark, oval plain of the _Mare Serenitatis_ on its northeastern side. The\r\ngreat bay running out from the _Mare_ toward the northwest, between the\r\nCaucasus and the huge mountain ring of Posidonius, bears the fanciful\r\nname of _Lacus Somniorum_. In the old days when the moon was supposed to\r\nbe inhabited, those terrestrial godfathers, led by the astronomer\r\nRiccioli, who were busy bestowing names upon the \"seas\" and mountains of\r\nour patient satellite, may have pleased their imagination by picturing\r\nthis arm of the \"Serene Sea\" as a peculiarly romantic sheet of water,\r\namid whose magical influences the lunar gentlefolk, drifting softly in\r\ntheir silver galleons and barges, and enjoying the splendors of \"full\r\nearth\" poured upon their delightful little world, were accustomed to\r\nfall into charming reveries, as even we hard-headed sons of Adam\r\noccasionally do when the waters under the keel are calm and smooth and\r\nthe balmy air of a moonlit night invokes the twin spirits of poetry and\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nPosidonius, the dominating feature of the shore line here, is an\r\nextraordinary example of the many formations on the moon which are so\r\ndifferent from everything on the earth that astronomers do not find it\r\neasy to bestow upon them names that truly describe them. It may be\r\ncalled a ring mountain or a ringed plain, for it is both. Its diameter\r\nexceeds sixty miles, and the interior plain lies about 2,000 feet below\r\nthe outer surface of the lunar ground. The mountain wall surrounding the\r\nring is by no means remarkable for elevation, its greatest height not\r\nexceeding 6,000 feet, but, owing to the broad sweep of the curved walls,\r\nthe brightness of the plain they inclose, and the picturesque\r\nirregularity of the silhouette of shadow thrown upon the valley floor by\r\nthe peaks encircling it, the effect produced upon the observer is very\r\nstriking and attractive.\r\n\r\nHaving finished with Posidonius and glanced across the broken region of\r\nthe Taurus Mountains toward the west, we turn next to consider the _Mare\r\nSerenitatis_. This broad gray plain, which, with a slight magnifying\r\npower, certainly looks enough like a sea to justify the first\r\ntelescopists in thinking that it might contain water, is about 430 by\r\n425 miles in extent, its area being 125,000 square miles. Running\r\ndirectly through its middle, nearly in a north and south line, is a\r\nlight streak, which even a good opera glass shows. This streak is the\r\nlargest and most wonderful of the many similar rays which extend on all\r\nsides from the great crater, or ring, of Tycho in the southern\r\nhemisphere. The ray in question is more than 2,000 miles long, and, like\r\nits shorter congeners, it turns aside for nothing; neither \"sea,\" nor\r\npeak, nor mountain range, nor crater ring, nor gorge, nor cañon, is able\r\nto divert it from its course. It ascends all heights and drops into all\r\ndepths with perfect indifference, but its continuity is not broken. When\r\nthe sun does not illuminate it at a proper angle, however, the\r\nmysterious ray vanishes. Is it a metallic vein, or is it volcanic lava\r\nor ash? Was the globe of the moon once split open along this line?\r\n\r\nThe _Mare Serenitatis_ is encircled by mountain ranges to a greater\r\nextent than any of the other lunar \"seas.\" On its eastern side the\r\nCaucasus and the Apennines shut it in, except for a strait a hundred\r\nmiles broad, by means of which it is connected with the _Mare Imbrium_.\r\nOn the south the range of the Hæmus Mountains borders it, on the north\r\nand northwest the Caucasus and the Taurus Mountains confine it, while on\r\nthe west, where again it connects itself by a narrow strait with another\r\n\"sea,\" the _Mare Tranquilitatis_, it encounters the massive uplift of\r\nMount Argæus. Not far from the eastern strait is found the remarkable\r\nlittle crater named Linné, not conspicuous on the gray floor of the\r\n_Mare_, yet easily enough found, and very interesting because a\r\nconsiderable change of form seems to have come over this crater some\r\ntime near the middle of the nineteenth century. In referring to it as a\r\ncrater it must not be forgotten that it does not form an opening in the\r\ntop of a mountain. In fact, the so-called craters on the moon, generally\r\nspeaking, are simply cavities in the lunar surface, whose bottoms lie\r\ndeep below the general level, instead of being elevated on the summit of\r\nmountains, and inclosed in a conical peak. In regard to the alleged\r\nchange in Linné, it has been suggested, not that a volcanic eruption\r\nbrought it about, but that a downfall of steep walls, or of an\r\nunsupported rocky floor, was the cause. The possibility of such an\r\noccurrence, it must be admitted, adds to the interest of the observer\r\nwho regularly studies the moon with a telescope.\r\n\r\nJust on the southern border of the _Mare_, the beautiful ring Menelaus\r\nlies in the center of the chain of the Hæmus Mountains. The ring is\r\nabout twenty miles across, and its central peak is composed of some\r\nhighly reflecting material, so that it shines very bright. The streak or\r\nray from Tycho which crosses the _Mare Serenitatis_ passes through the\r\nwalls of Menelaus, and perhaps the central peak is composed of the same\r\nsubstance that forms the ray. Something more than a hundred miles\r\neast-southeast from Menelaus, in the midst of the dark _Mare Vaporum_,\r\nis another brilliant ring mountain which catches the eye, Manilius. It\r\nexceeds Menelaus in brightness as well as in size, its diameter being\r\nabout twenty-five miles. There is something singular underlying the dark\r\nlunar surface here, for not only is Manilius extraordinarily brilliant\r\nin contrast with the surrounding plain, but out of that plain, about\r\nforty miles toward the east, projects a small mountain which is also\r\nremarkable for its reflecting properties, as if the gray ground were\r\nunderlain by a stratum of some material that flashes back the sunlight\r\nwherever it is exposed. The crater mountain, Sulpicius Gallus, on the\r\nborder of the _Mare_, north of Manilius and east of Menelaus, is another\r\nexample of the strange shining quality of certain formations on the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nFollow next the Hæmus range westward until the attention falls upon the\r\ngreat ring mountain Plinius, more than thirty miles across, and bearing\r\nan unusual resemblance to a fortification. Mr. T. G. Elger, the\r\ncelebrated English selenographer, says of Plinius that, at sunrise, \"it\r\nreminds one of a great fortress or redoubt erected to command the\r\npassage between the _Mare Tranquilitatis_ and the _Mare Serenitatis_.\"\r\nBut, of course, the resemblance is purely fanciful. Men, even though\r\nthey dwelt in the moon, would not build a rampart 6,000 feet high!\r\n\r\nMount Argæus, at the southwest corner of the _Mare Serenitatis_, is a\r\nvery wonderful object when the sun has just risen upon it. This occurs\r\nfive days after the new moon.\r\n\r\nReturning to the eastern extremity of the _Mare_, we glance, in passing,\r\nat the precipitous Mount Hadley, which rises more than 15,000 feet above\r\nthe level of the _Mare_ and forms the northern point of the Apennine\r\nrange. Passing into the region of the _Mare Imbrium_, whose western end\r\nis divided into the _Palus Putredinis_ on the south and the _Palus\r\nNebularum_ on the north, we notice three conspicuous ring mountains,\r\nCassini near the Alps, and Aristillus and Autolycus, a beautiful pair,\r\nnearly opposite the strait connecting the two _Maria_. Cassini is\r\nthirty-six miles in diameter, Aristillus thirty-four, and Autolycus\r\ntwenty-three. The first named is shallow, only 4,000 feet in depth from\r\nthe highest point of its wall, while Aristillus carries some peaks on\r\nits girdle 11,000 feet high. Autolycus, like Cassini, is of no very\r\ngreat depth.\r\n\r\nWestward from the middle of an imaginary line joining Aristillus and\r\nCassini is the much smaller crater Theætetus. Outside the walls of this\r\nare a number of craterlets, and a French astronomer, Charbonneaux, of\r\nthe Meudon Observatory, reported in December, 1900, that he had\r\nrepeatedly observed white clouds appearing and disappearing over one of\r\nthese small craters.\r\n\r\nSouth of the _Mare Vaporum_ are found some of the most notable of those\r\nstrange lunar features that are called \"clefts\" or \"rills.\" Two crater\r\nmountains, in particular, are connected with them, Ariadæus at the\r\neastern edge of the _Mare Tranquilitatis_ and Hyginus on the southern\r\nborder of the _Mare Vaporum_. These clefts appear to be broad and deep\r\nchasms, like the cañons cut by terrestrial rivers, but it can not be\r\nbelieved that the lunar cañons are the work of rivers. They are rather\r\ncracks in the lunar crust, although their bottoms are frequently\r\nvisible. The principal cleft from Ariadæus runs eastward and passes\r\nbetween two neighboring craters, the southern of which is named\r\nSilberschlag, and is noteworthy for its brightness. The Hyginus cleft is\r\nbroader and runs directly through the crater ring of that name.\r\n\r\nThe observer will find much to interest him in the great, irregular, and\r\nmuch-broken mountain ring called Julius Cæsar, as well as in the ring\r\nmountains, Godin, Agrippa, and Triesnecker. The last named, besides\r\npresenting magnificent shadows when the sunlight falls aslant upon it,\r\nis the center of a complicated system of rills, some of which can be\r\ntraced with our five-inch glass.\r\n\r\nWe next take up Lunar Chart No. 2, and pay a telescopic visit to the\r\nsouthwestern quarter of the lunar world. The _Mare Tranquilitatis_\r\nmerges through straits into two southern extensions, the _Mare\r\nFecunditatis_ and the _Mare Nectaris_. The great ring mountains or\r\nringed plains, Langrenus, Vendelinus, Petavius, and Furnerius, all lying\r\nsignificantly along the same lunar meridian, have already been noticed.\r\nTheir linear arrangement and isolated position recall the row of huge\r\nvolcanic peaks that runs parallel with the shore of the Pacific Ocean in\r\nOregon and Washington--Mount Jefferson, Mount Hood, Mount St. Helen's,\r\nMount Tacoma--but these terrestrial volcanoes, except in elevation, are\r\nmere pins' heads in the comparison.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern part of the _Mare Fecunditatis_ lies a pair of relatively\r\nsmall craters named Messier, which possess particular interest because\r\nit has been suspected, though not proved, that a change of form has\r\noccurred in one or other of the pair. Mädler, in the first half of the\r\nnineteenth century, represented the two craters as exactly alike in all\r\nrespects. In 1855 Webb discovered that they are not alike in shape, and\r\nthat the easternmost one is the larger, and every observer easily sees\r\nthat Webb's description is correct. Messier is also remarkable for the\r\nlight streak, often said to resemble a comet's tail, which extends from\r\nthe larger crater eastward to the shore of the _Mare Fecunditatis_.\r\n\r\nGoclenius and Guttemberg, on the highland between the _Mare\r\nFecunditatis_ and the _Mare Nectaris_, are intersected and surrounded by\r\nclefts, besides being remarkable for their broken and irregular though\r\nlofty walls. Guttemberg is forty-five miles and Goclenius twenty-eight\r\nmiles in diameter. The short mountain range just east of Guttemberg, and\r\nbordering a part of the _Mare Nectaris_ on the west, is called the\r\nPyrenees.\r\n\r\nThe _Mare Nectaris_, though offering in its appearance no explanation of\r\nits toothsome name--perhaps it was regarded as the drinking cup of the\r\nOlympian gods--is one of the most singular of the dark lunar plains in\r\nits outlines. At the south it ends in a vast semicircular bay, sixty\r\nmiles across, which is evidently a half-submerged mountain ring. But\r\nsubmerged by what? Not water, but perhaps a sea of lava which has now\r\nsolidified and forms the floor of the _Mare Nectaris_. The name of this\r\nsingular formation is Fracastorius. Elger has an interesting remark\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n\"On the higher portion of the interior, near the center,\" he says, \"is a\r\ncurious object consisting apparently of four light spots, arranged in a\r\nsquare, with a craterlet in the middle, all of which undergo notable\r\nchanges of aspect under different phases.\"\r\n\r\nOther writers also call attention to the fine markings, minute\r\ncraterlets, and apparently changeable spots on the floor of\r\nFracastorius.\r\n\r\nWe go now to the eastern side of the _Mare Nectaris_, where we find one\r\nof the most stupendous formations in the lunar world, the great mountain\r\nring of Theophilus, noticeably regular in outline and perfect in the\r\ncompleteness of its lofty wall. The circular interior, which contains in\r\nthe center a group of mountains, one of whose peaks is 6,000 feet high,\r\nsinks 10,000 feet below the general level of the moon outside the wall!\r\nOne of the peaks on the western edge towers more than 18,000 feet above\r\nthe floor within, while several other peaks attain elevations of 15,000\r\nto 16,000 feet. The diameter of the immense ring, from crest to crest of\r\nthe wall, is sixty-four miles. Theophilus is especially wonderful on the\r\nfifth and sixth days of the moon, when the sun climbs its shining\r\npinnacles and slowly discloses the tremendous chasm that lies within its\r\ncircles of terrible precipices.\r\n\r\nOn the southeast Theophilus is connected by extensions of its walls with\r\na shattered ring of vast extent called Cyrillus; and south from\r\nCyrillus, and connected with the same system of broken walls, lies the\r\nstill larger ring named Catharina, whose half-ruined walls and numerous\r\ncrater pits present a fascinating spectacle as the shadows retreat\r\nbefore the sunrise advancing across them. These three--Theophilus,\r\nCyrillus, and Catharina--constitute a scene of surpassing magnificence,\r\na glimpse of wonders in another world sufficient to satisfy the most\r\nriotous imagination.\r\n\r\nSouth of the _Mare Nectaris_ the huge ring mountain of Piccolomini\r\nattracts attention, its massive walls surrounding a floor nearly sixty\r\nmiles across, and rising in some places to an altitude of nearly 15,000\r\nfeet. It should be understood that wherever the height of the mountain\r\nwall of such a ring is mentioned, the reference level is that of the\r\ninterior plain or floor. The elevation, reckoned from the outer side, is\r\nalways very much less.\r\n\r\nThe entire region south and east of Theophilus and its great neighbors\r\nis marvelously rough and broken. Approaching the center of the moon, we\r\nfind a system of ringed plains even greater in area than any of those we\r\nhave yet seen. Hipparchus is nearly a hundred miles long from north to\r\nsouth, and nearly ninety miles broad from east to west. But its walls\r\nhave been destroyed to such an extent that, after all, it yields in\r\ngrandeur to a formation like Theophilus.\r\n\r\nAlbategnius is sixty-five miles across, with peaks from 10,000 to 15,000\r\nfeet in height. Sacrobosco is a confused mass of broken and distorted\r\nwalls. Aliacensis is remarkable for having a peak on the eastern side of\r\nits wall which is more than 16,000 feet high. Werner, forty-five miles\r\nin diameter, is interesting because under its northeastern wall Mädler,\r\nsome seventy years ago, saw a light spot of astonishing brightness,\r\nunmatched in that respect by anything on the moon except the peak of\r\nAristarchus, which we shall see later. This spot seems afterward to have\r\nlost brilliance, and the startling suggestion has been made that its\r\noriginal brightness might have been due to its then recent deposit from\r\na little crater that lies in the midst of it. Walter is of gigantic\r\ndimensions, about one hundred miles in diameter. Unlike the majority of\r\nthe ringed plains, it departs widely from a circle. Stöfler is yet\r\nlarger than Walter; but most interesting of all these gigantic\r\nformations is Maurolycus, whose diameter exceeds one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles, and which has walls 13,000 or 14,000 feet high. Yet, astonishing\r\nthough it may seem, this vast and complicated mass of mountain walls,\r\ncraters, and peaks, is virtually unseen at full moon, owing to the\r\nperpendicularity of the sunlight, which prevents the casting of shadows.\r\n\r\nWe shall next suppose that another period of about seven days has\r\nelapsed, the moon in the meantime reaching its full phase. We refer for\r\nguidance to Lunar Chart No. 3. The peculiarity of the northeastern\r\nquadrant which immediately strikes the eye is the prevalence of the\r\nbroad plains called _Maria_, or \"seas.\" The northern and central parts\r\nare occupied by the _Mare Imbrium_, the \"Sea of Showers\" or of \"Rains,\"\r\nwith its dark bay the _Sinus Æstuum_, while the eastern half is covered\r\nby the vast _Oceanus Procellarum_, the \"Ocean of Storms\" or of\r\n\"Tempests.\"\r\n\r\nToward the north a conspicuous oval, remarkably dark in hue, immediately\r\nattracts our attention. It is the celebrated ringed plain of Plato,\r\nabout sixty miles in diameter and surrounded by a saw-edged rampart,\r\nsome of whose pinnacles are 6,000 or 7,000 feet high. Plato is a\r\nfavorite subject for study by selenographers because of the changes of\r\ncolor which its broad, flat floor undergoes as the sun rises upon it,\r\nand also because of the existence of enigmatical spots and streaks whose\r\nvisibility changes. South of Plato, in the _Mare Imbrium_, rises a\r\nprecipitous, isolated peak called Pico, 8,000 feet in height. Its\r\nresemblance in situation to the conical mountain Pico in the Azores\r\nstrikes the observer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUNAR CHART NO. 3, NORTHEAST QUARTER.]\r\n\r\nEastward of Plato a line of highlands, separating the _Mare Imbrium_\r\nfrom the _Mare Frigoris,_ carries the eye to the beautiful semicircular\r\n_Sinus Iridum_, or \"Bay of Rainbows.\" The northwestern extremity of\r\nthis remarkable bay is guarded by a steep and lofty promontory called\r\nCape Laplace, while the southeastern extremity also has its towering\r\nguardian, Cape Heraclides. The latter is interesting for showing,\r\nbetween nine and ten days after full moon, a singularly perfect profile\r\nof a woman's face looking out across the _Mare Imbrium_. The winding\r\nlines, like submerged ridges, delicately marking the floor of the _Sinus\r\nIridum_ and that of the _Mare_ beyond, are beautiful telescopic\r\nobjects. The \"bay\" is about one hundred and thirty-five miles long by\r\neighty-four broad.\r\n\r\nThe _Mare Imbrium_, covering 340,000 square miles, is sparingly dotted\r\nover with craters. All of the more conspicuous of them are indicated in\r\nthe chart. The smaller ones, like Caroline Herschel, Helicon, Leverrier,\r\nDélisle, etc., vary from eight to twelve miles in diameter. Lambert is\r\nseventeen miles in diameter, and Euler nineteen, while Timocharis is\r\ntwenty-three miles broad and 7,000 feet deep below its walls, which rise\r\nonly 3,000 feet above the surface of the _Mare_.\r\n\r\nToward the eastern border of the sea, south of the Harbinger Mountains,\r\nwe find a most remarkable object, the mountain ring, or crater plain,\r\ncalled Aristarchus. This ring is not quite thirty miles in diameter, but\r\nthere is nothing on the moon that can compare with it in dazzling\r\nbrilliance. The central peak, 1,200 or 1,300 feet high, gleams like a\r\nmountain of crusted snow, or as if it were composed of a mass of\r\nfresh-broken white metal, or of compacted crystals. Part of the inner\r\nslope of the east wall is equally brilliant. In fact, so much light is\r\npoured out of the circumvallation that the eye is partially blinded, and\r\nunable distinctly to see the details of the interior. No satisfactory\r\nexplanation of the extraordinary reflecting power of Aristarchus has\r\never been offered. Its neighbor toward the east, Herodotus, is somewhat\r\nsmaller and not remarkably bright, but it derives great interest from\r\nthe fact that out of a breach in its northern wall issues a vast cleft,\r\nor chasm, which winds away for nearly a hundred miles across the floor\r\nof the _Mare_, making an abrupt turn when it reaches the foot of the\r\nHarbinger Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively small crater, Lichtenberg, near the northeastern limb\r\nof the moon, is interesting because Mädler used to see in its\r\nneighborhood a pale-red tint which has not been noticed since his day.\r\n\r\nReturning to the western side of the quadrant represented in Lunar Chart\r\nNo. 3, we see the broad and beautifully regular ringed plain of\r\nArchimedes, fifty miles in diameter and 4,000 feet deep.\r\n\r\nA number of clefts extend between the mountainous neighborhood of\r\nArchimedes and the feet of the gigantic Apennine Mountains on the\r\nsouthwest. The little double crater, Beer, between Archimedes and\r\nTimocharis, is very bright.\r\n\r\nThe Apennines extend about four hundred and eighty miles in a\r\nnorthwesterly and southeasterly direction. One of their peaks near the\r\nsouthern end of the range, Mount Huygens, is at least 18,000 feet high,\r\nand the black silhouettes of their sharp-pointed shadows thrown upon the\r\nsmooth floor of the _Mare Imbrium_ about the time of first quarter\r\npresent a spectacle as beautiful as it is unique. The Apennines end at\r\nthe southeast in the ring mountain, Eratosthenes, thirty-eight miles\r\nacross and very deep, one of its encircling chain of peaks rising 16,000\r\nfeet above the floor, and about half that height above the level of the\r\n_Mare Imbrium_. The shadows cast by Eratosthenes at sunrise are\r\nmagnificent.\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to one of the supreme spectacles of the moon, the\r\nimmense ring or crater mountain Copernicus. This is generally regarded\r\nas the grandest object that the telescope reveals on the earth's\r\nsatellite. It is about fifty-six miles across, and its interior falls to\r\na depth of 8,000 feet below the _Mare Imbrium_. Its broad wall, composed\r\nof circle within circle of ridges, terraces, and precipices, rises on\r\nthe east about 12,000 feet above the floor. On the inner side the slopes\r\nare very steep, cliff falling below cliff, until the bottom of the\r\nfearful abyss is attained. To descend those precipices and reach the\r\ndepressed floor of Copernicus would be a memorable feat for a\r\nmountaineer. In the center of the floor rises a complicated mountain\r\nmass about 2,400 feet high. All around Copernicus the surface of the\r\nmoon is dotted with countless little crater pits, and splashed with\r\nwhitish streaks. Northward lie the Carpathian Mountains, terminating on\r\nthe east in Tobias Mayer, a ring mountain more than twenty miles across.\r\nThe mountain ring Kepler, which is also the center of a great system of\r\nwhitish streaks and splashes, is twenty-two miles in diameter, and\r\nnotably brilliant.\r\n\r\nFinally, we turn to the southeastern quadrant of the moon, represented\r\nin Lunar Chart No. 4. The broad, dark expanse extending from the north\r\nis the _Mare Nubium_ on the west and the _Oceanus Procellarum_ on the\r\neast. Toward the southeast appears the notably dark, rounded area of the\r\n_Mare Humorum_ inclosed by highlands and rings. We begin with the range\r\nof vast inclosures running southward near the central meridian, and\r\nstarting with Ptolemæus, a walled plain one hundred and fifteen miles in\r\nits greatest diameter and covering an area considerably exceeding that\r\nof the State of Massachusetts. Its neighbor toward the south, Alphonsus,\r\nis eighty-three miles across. Next comes Arzachel, more than sixty-five\r\nmiles in diameter. Thebit, more than thirty miles across, is very deep.\r\nEast of Thebit lies the celebrated \"lunar railroad,\" a straight,\r\nisolated wall about five hundred feet high and sixty-five miles long,\r\ndividing at its southern end into a number of curious branches, forming\r\nthe buttresses of a low mountain. Purbach is sixty miles broad, and\r\nsouth of that comes a wonderful region where the ring mountains Hell,\r\nBall, Lexell, and others, more or less connected with walls, inclose an\r\narea even larger than Ptolemæus, but which, not being so distinctly\r\nbordered as some of the other inclosed plains, bears no distinctive\r\nname.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUNAR CHART NO. 4, SOUTHEAST QUARTER.]\r\n\r\nThe next conspicuous object toward the south ranks with Copernicus among\r\nthe grandest of all lunar phenomena--the ring, or crater, Tycho. It is\r\nabout fifty-four miles in diameter and some points on its wall rise\r\n17,000 feet above the interior. In the center is a bright mountain peak\r\n5,000 feet high. But wonderful as are the details of its mountain ring,\r\nthe chief attraction of Tycho is its manifest relation to the mysterious\r\nbright rays heretofore referred to, which extend far across the surface\r\nof the moon in all directions, and of which it is the center. The\r\nstreaks about Copernicus are short and confused, constituting rather a\r\nsplash than a regular system of rays; but those emanating from Tycho are\r\nvery long, regular, comparatively narrow, and form arcs of great circles\r\nwhich stretch away for hundreds of miles, allowing no obstacle to\r\ninterrupt their course.\r\n\r\nSouthwest of Tycho lies the vast ringed plain of Maginus, a hundred\r\nmiles broad and very wonderful to look upon, with its labyrinth of\r\nformations, when the sun slopes across it, and yet, like Maurolycus,\r\ninvisible under a vertical illumination. \"The full moon,\" to use\r\nMädler's picturesque expression, \"knows no Maginus.\" Still larger and\r\nyet more splendid is Clavius, which exceeds one hundred and forty miles\r\nin diameter and covers 16,000 square miles of ground within its fringing\r\nwalls, which carry some of the loftiest peaks on the moon, several\r\nattaining 17,000 feet. The floor is deeply depressed, so that an\r\ninhabitant of this singular inclosure, larger than Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, and Rhode Island combined, would dwell in land sunk two\r\nmiles below the general level of the world about him.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of the south pole lies the large walled plain of\r\nNewton, whose interior is the deepest known depression on the moon. It\r\nis so deep that the sunshine never touches the larger part of the floor\r\nof the inner abyss, and a peak on its eastern wall rises 24,000 feet\r\nsheer above the tremendous pit. Other enormous walled plains are\r\nLongomontanus, Wilhelm I, Schiller, Bailly, and Schickard. The latter is\r\none hundred and thirty-four miles long and bordered by a ring varying\r\nfrom 4,000 to 9,000 feet in height. Wargentin, the oval close to the\r\nmoon's southeast limb, beyond Schickard, is a unique formation in that,\r\ninstead of its interior being sunk below the general level, it is\r\nelevated above it. It has been suggested that this peculiarity is due to\r\nthe fact that the floor of Wargentin was formed by inflation from below,\r\nand that it has cooled and solidified in the shape of a gigantic dome\r\narched over an immense cavity beneath. A dome of such dimensions,\r\nhowever, could not retain its form unless partly supported from beneath.\r\n\r\nHainzel is interesting from its curious outline; Cichus for the huge\r\nyawning crater on its eastern wall; Capuanus for a brilliant shining\r\ncrater also on its eastern wall; and Mercator for possessing bright\r\ncraters on both its east and its west walls. Vitello has a bright\r\ncentral mountain and gains conspicuousness from its position at the edge\r\nof the dark _Mare Humorum_. Agatharchides is the broken remnant of a\r\ngreat ring mountain. Gassendi, an extremely beautiful object, is about\r\nfifty-five miles across. It is encircled with broken walls, craters and\r\nbright points, and altogether presents a very splendid appearance about\r\nthe eleventh day of the moon's age.\r\n\r\nLetronne is a half-submerged ring, at the southern end of the _Oceanus\r\nProcellarum_, which recalls Fracastorius in the western lunar\r\nhemisphere. It lies, however, ten degrees nearer the equator than\r\nFracastorius. Billy is a mountain ring whose interior seems to have been\r\nsubmerged by the dark substance of the _Oceanus Procellarum_, although\r\nits walls have remained intact. Mersenius is a very conspicuous ring,\r\nforty miles in diameter, east of the _Mare Humorum_. Vieta, fifty miles\r\nacross, is also a fine object. Grimaldi, a huge dusky oval, is nearly\r\none hundred and fifty miles in its greatest length. The ring mountain\r\nLandsberg, on the equator, and near the center of the visible eastern\r\nhemisphere, is worth watching because Elger noticed changes of color in\r\nits interior in 1888.\r\n\r\nBullialdus, in the midst of the _Mare Nubium_, is a very conspicuous and\r\nbeautiful ring mountain about thirty-eight miles in diameter, with walls\r\n8,000 feet high above the interior.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to see the lunar mountains in all their varying aspects\r\nwill not content themselves with views obtained during the advance of\r\nthe sunlight from west to east, between \"new moon\" and \"full moon,\" but\r\nwill continue their observations during the retreat of the sunlight from\r\neast to west, after the full phase is passed.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the hemisphere of the moon which is forever turned\r\naway from the earth is quite as marvelous in its features as the part\r\nthat we see. It will be noticed that the entire circle of the moon's\r\nlimb, with insignificant interruptions, is mountainous. Possibly the\r\ninvisible side of our satellite contains yet grander peaks and crater\r\nmountains than any that our telescopes can reach. This probability is\r\nincreased by the fact that the loftiest known mountain on the moon is\r\nnever seen except in silhouette. It is a member of a great chain that\r\nbreaks the lunar limb west of the south pole, and that is called the\r\nLeibnitz Mountains. The particular peak referred to is said by some\r\nauthorities to exceed 30,000 feet in height. Other great ranges seen\r\nonly in profile are the Dörfel Mountains on the limb behind the ring\r\nplain Bailly, the Cordilleras, east of Eichstadt, and the D'Alembert\r\nMountains beyond Grimaldi. The profile of these great mountains is\r\nparticularly fine when they are seen during an eclipse of the sun. Then,\r\nwith the disk of the sun for a background, they stand out with startling\r\ndistinctness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUN\r\n\r\nWhen the sun is covered with spots it becomes a most interesting object\r\nfor telescopic study. Every amateur's telescope should be provided with\r\napparatus for viewing the sun. A dark shade glass is not sufficient and\r\nnot safe. What is known as a solar prism, consisting of two solid prisms\r\nof glass, cemented together in a brass box which carries a short tube\r\nfor the eyepiece, and reflecting an image of the sun from their plane of\r\njunction--while the major remnant of light and heat passes directly\r\nthrough them and escapes from an opening provided for the\r\npurpose--serves very well. Better and more costly is an apparatus called\r\na helioscope, constructed on the principle of polarization and provided\r\nwith prisms and reflectors which enable the observer, by proper\r\nadjustment, to govern very exactly and delicately the amount of light\r\nthat passes into the eyepiece.\r\n\r\nFurnished with an apparatus of this description we can employ either a\r\nthree-, four-, or five-inch glass upon the sun with much satisfaction.\r\nFor the amateur's purposes the sun is only specially interesting when it\r\nis spotted. The first years of the twentieth century will behold a\r\ngradual growth in the number and size of the solar spots as those years\r\nhappen to coincide with the increasing phase of the sun-spot period.\r\nLarge sun spots and groups of spots often present an immense amount of\r\ndetail which tasks the skill of the draughtsman to represent it. But a\r\nlittle practice will enable one to produce very good representations of\r\nsun spots, as well as of the whitish patches called faculæ by which they\r\nare frequently surrounded.\r\n\r\nFor the simple purpose of exhibiting the spotted face of the sun without\r\nmuch magnifying power, a telescope may be used to project the solar\r\nimage on a white sheet or screen. If the experiment is tried in a room,\r\na little ingenuity will enable the observer to arrange a curtain\r\ncovering the window used, in such a way as to exclude all the light\r\nexcept that which comes through the telescope. Then, by placing a sheet\r\nof paper or a drawing board before the eyepiece and focusing the image\r\nof the sun upon it, very good results may be obtained.\r\n\r\nIf one has a permanent mounting and a driving clock, a small\r\nspectroscope may be attached, for solar observations, even to a\r\ntelescope of only four or five inches aperture, and with its aid most\r\ninteresting views may be obtained of the wonderful red hydrogen flames\r\nthat frequently appear at the edge of the solar disk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nARE THERE PLANETS AMONG THE STARS?\r\n\r\n               \"... And if there should be\r\nWorlds greater than thine own, inhabited\r\nBy greater things, and they themselves far more\r\nIn number than the dust of thy dull earth,\r\nWhat wouldst thou think?\"--BYRON'S CAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis always interesting question has lately been revived in a startling\r\nmanner by discoveries that have seemed to reach almost deep enough to\r\ntouch its solution. The following sentences, from the pen of Dr. T. J.\r\nJ. See, of the Lowell Observatory, are very significant from this point\r\nof view:\r\n\r\n\"Our observations during 1896-'97 have certainly disclosed stars more\r\ndifficult than any which astronomers had seen before. Among these\r\nobscure objects about half a dozen are truly wonderful, in that they\r\nseem to be dark, almost black in color, and apparently are shining by a\r\ndull reflected light. It is unlikely that they will prove to be\r\nself-luminous. If they should turn out dark bodies in fact, shining only\r\nby the reflected light of the stars around which they revolve, we should\r\nhave the first case of planets--dark bodies--noticed among the fixed\r\nstars.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, Dr. See has no reference in this statement to the immense\r\ndark bodies which, in recent years, have been discovered by\r\nspectroscopic methods revolving around some of the visible stars,\r\nalthough invisible themselves. The obscure objects that he describes\r\nbelong to a different class, and might be likened, except perhaps in\r\nmagnitude, to the companion of Sirius, which, though a light-giving\r\nbody, exhibits nevertheless a singular defect of luminosity in relation\r\nto its mass. Sirius has only twice the mass, but ten thousand times the\r\nluminosity, of its strange companion! Yet the latter is evidently rather\r\na faint, or partially extinguished, sun than an opaque body shining only\r\nwith light borrowed from its dazzling neighbor. The objects seen by Dr.\r\nSee, on the contrary, are \"apparently shining by a dull reflected\r\nlight.\"\r\n\r\nIf, however (as he evidently thinks is probable), these objects should\r\nprove to be really non-luminous, it would not follow that they are to be\r\nregarded as more like the planets of the solar system than like the dark\r\ncompanions of certain other stars. A planet, in the sense which we\r\nattach to the word, can not be comparable in mass and size with the sun\r\naround which it revolves. The sun is a thousand times larger than the\r\ngreatest of its attendant planets, Jupiter, and more than a million\r\ntimes larger than the earth. It is extremely doubtful whether the\r\nrelation of sun and planet could exist between two bodies of anything\r\nlike equal size, or even if one exceeded the other many times in\r\nmagnitude. It is only when the difference is so great that the smaller\r\nof the two bodies is insignificant in comparison with the larger, that\r\nthe former could become a cool, life-bearing globe, nourished by the\r\nbeneficent rays of its organic comrade and master.\r\n\r\nJudged by our terrestrial experience, which is all we have to go by, the\r\nmagnitude of a planet, if it is to bear life resembling that of the\r\nearth, is limited by other considerations. Even Jupiter, which, as far\r\nas our knowledge extends, represents the extreme limit of great\r\nplanetary size, may be too large ever to become the abode of living\r\nbeings of a high organization. The force of gravitation on the surface\r\nof Jupiter exceeds that on the earth's surface as 2.64 to 1.\r\nConsidering the effects of this on the weight and motion of bodies, the\r\ndensity of the atmosphere, etc., it is evident that Jupiter would, to\r\nsay the very least, be an exceedingly uncomfortable place of abode for\r\nbeings resembling ourselves. But Jupiter, if it is ever to become a\r\nsolid, rocky globe like ours, must shrink enormously in volume, since\r\nits density is only 0.24 as compared with the earth. Now, the surface\r\ngravity of a planet depends on its mass and its radius, being directly\r\nas the former and inversely as the square of the latter. But in\r\nshrinking Jupiter will lose none of its mass, although its radius will\r\nbecome much smaller. The force of gravity will consequently increase on\r\nits surface as the planet gets smaller and more dense.\r\n\r\nThe present mean diameter of Jupiter is 86,500 miles, while its mass\r\nexceeds that of the earth in the ratio of 316 to 1. Suppose Jupiter\r\nshrunk to three quarters of its present diameter, or 64,800 miles, then\r\nits surface gravity would exceed the earth's nearly five times. With one\r\nhalf its present diameter the surface gravity would become more than ten\r\ntimes that of the earth. On such a planet a man's bones would snap\r\nbeneath his weight, even granting that he could remain upright at all!\r\nIt would seem, then, that, unless we are to abandon terrestrial\r\nanalogies altogether and \"go it blind,\" we must set an upper limit to\r\nthe magnitude of a habitable planet, and that Jupiter represents such\r\nupper limit, if, indeed, he does not transcend it.\r\n\r\nThe question then becomes, Can the faint objects seen by Dr. See and his\r\nfellow-observers, in the near neighborhood of certain stars, be planets\r\nin the sense just described, or are they necessarily far greater in\r\nmagnitude than the largest planet, in the accepted sense of that word,\r\nwhich can be admitted into the category--viz., the planet Jupiter? This\r\nresolves itself into another question: At what distance would Jupiter be\r\nvisible with a powerful telescope, supposing it to receive from a\r\nneighboring star an amount of illumination not less than that which it\r\ngets from the sun? To be sure, we do not know how far away the faint\r\nobjects described by Dr. See are; but, at any rate, we can safely assume\r\nthat they are at the distance of the nearest stars, say somewhere about\r\nthree hundred thousand times the earth's distance from the sun. The sun\r\nitself removed to that distance would appear to our eyes only as a star\r\nof the first magnitude. But Zöllner has shown that the sun exceeds\r\nJupiter in brilliancy 5,472,000,000 times. Seen from equal distances,\r\nhowever, the ratio would be about 218,000,000 to 1. This would be the\r\nratio of their light if both sun and Jupiter could be removed to about\r\nthe distance of the nearest stars. Since the sun would then be only as\r\nbright as one of the stars of the first magnitude, and since Jupiter\r\nwould be 218,000,000 times less brilliant, it is evident that the latter\r\nwould not be visible at all. The faintest stars that the most powerful\r\ntelescopes are able to show probably do not fall below the sixteenth or,\r\nat the most, the seventeenth magnitude. But a seventeenth-magnitude star\r\nis only between two and three million times fainter than the sun would\r\nappear at the distance above supposed, while, as we have seen, Jupiter\r\nwould be more than two hundred million times fainter than the sun.\r\n\r\nTo put it in another way: Jupiter, at the distance of the nearest stars,\r\nwould be not far from one hundred times less bright than the faintest\r\nstar which the largest telescope is just able, under the most exquisite\r\nconditions, to glimpse. To see a star so faint as that would require an\r\nobject-glass of a diameter half as great as the length of the tube of\r\nthe Lick telescope, or say thirty feet!\r\n\r\nOf course, Jupiter might be more brilliantly illuminated by a brighter\r\nstar than the sun; but, granting that, it still would not be visible at\r\nsuch a distance, even if we neglect the well-known concealing or\r\nblinding effect of the rays of a bright star when the observer is trying\r\nto view a faint one close to it. Clearly, then, the obscure objects seen\r\nby Dr. See near some of the stars, if they really are bodies visible\r\nonly by light reflected from their surfaces, must be enormously larger\r\nthan the planet Jupiter, and can not, accordingly, be admitted into the\r\ncategory of planets proper, whatever else they may be.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they are extreme cases of what we see in the system of\r\nSirius--i.e., a brilliant star with a companion which has ceased to\r\nshine as a star while retaining its bulk. Such bodies may be called\r\nplanets in that they only shine by reflected light, and that they are\r\nattached to a brilliant sun; but the part that they play in their\r\nsystems is not strictly planetary. Owing to their great mass they bear\r\nsuch sway over their shining companions as none of our planets, nor all\r\nof them combined, can exercise; and for the same reason they can not,\r\nexcept in a dream, be imagined to possess that which, in our eyes, must\r\nalways be the capital feature of a planet, rendering it in the highest\r\ndegree interesting wherever it may be found--sentient life.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow, however, that there are no real planetary bodies\r\nrevolving around the stars. As Dr. See himself remarks, such\r\ninsignificant bodies as our planets could not be seen at the distance of\r\nthe fixed stars, \"even if the power of our telescopes were increased a\r\nhundredfold, and consequently no such systems are _known_.\"\r\n\r\nThis brings me to another branch of the subject. In the same article\r\nfrom which I have already quoted (Recent Discoveries respecting the\r\nOrigin of the Universe, Atlantic Monthly, vol. lxxx, pages 484-492),\r\nDr. See sets forth the main results of his well-known studies on the\r\norigin of the double and multiple star systems. He finds that the\r\nstellar systems differ from the solar system markedly in two respects,\r\nwhich he thus describes:\r\n\r\n    \"1. The orbits are highly eccentric; on the average twelve times\r\n    more elongated than those of the planets and satellites.\r\n\r\n    \"2. The components of the stellar systems are frequently equal and\r\n    always comparable in mass, whereas our satellites are insignificant\r\n    compared to their planets, and the planets are equally small\r\n    compared to the sun.\"\r\n\r\nThese peculiarities of the star systems Dr. See ascribes to the effect\r\nof \"tidal friction,\" the double stars having had their birth through\r\nfission of original fluid masses (just as the moon, according to George\r\nDarwin's theory, was born from the earth), and the reaction of tidal\r\nfriction having not only driven them gradually farther apart but\r\nrendered their orbits more and more eccentric. This manner of evolution\r\nof a stellar system Dr. See contrasts with Laplace's hypothesis of the\r\norigin of the planetary system through the successive separation of\r\nrings from the periphery of the contracting solar nebula, and the\r\ngradual breaking up of those rings and their aggregation into spherical\r\nmasses or planets. While not denying that the process imagined by\r\nLaplace may have taken place in our system, he discovers no evidence of\r\nits occurrence among the double stars, and this leads him to the\r\nfollowing statement, in which believers in the old theological doctrine\r\nthat the earth is the sole center of mortal life and of divine care\r\nwould have found much comfort:\r\n\r\n\"It is very singular that no visible system yet discerned has any\r\nresemblance to the orderly and beautiful system in which we live; and\r\none is thus led to think that probably our system is unique in its\r\ncharacter. At least it is unique among all _known_ systems.\"\r\n\r\nIf we grant that the solar system is the only one in which small planets\r\nexist revolving around their sun in nearly circular orbits, then indeed\r\nwe seem to have closed all the outer universe against such beings as the\r\ninhabitants of the earth. Beyond the sun's domain only whirling stars,\r\ncoupled in eccentric orbits, dark stars, some of them, but no\r\nplanets--in short a wilderness, full of all energies except those of\r\nsentient life! This is not a pleasing picture, and I do not think we are\r\ndriven to contemplate it. Beyond doubt, Dr. See is right in concluding\r\nthat double and multiple star systems, with their components all of\r\nmagnitudes comparable among themselves, revolving in exceedingly\r\neccentric orbits under the stress of mutual gravitation, bear no\r\nresemblance to the orderly system of our sun with its attendant worlds.\r\nAnd it is not easy to imagine that the respective members of such\r\nsystems could themselves be the centers of minor systems of planets, on\r\naccount of the perturbing influences to which the orbits of such minor\r\nsystems would be subjected.\r\n\r\nBut the double and multiple stars, numerous though they be, are\r\noutnumbered a hundred to one by the single stars which shine alone as\r\nour sun does. What reason can we have, then, for excluding these single\r\nstars, constituting as they do the vast majority of the celestial host,\r\nfrom a similarity to the sun in respect to the manner of their evolution\r\nfrom the original nebulous condition? These stars exhibit no companions,\r\nsuch planetary attendants as they may have lying, on account of their\r\nminuteness, far beyond the reach of our most powerful instruments. But\r\nsince they vastly outnumber the binary and multiple systems, and since\r\nthey resemble the sun in having no large attendants, should we be\r\njustified, after all, in regarding our system as \"unique\"? It is true we\r\ndo not know, by visual evidence, that the single stars have planets, but\r\nwe find planets attending the only representative of that class of stars\r\nthat we are able to approach closely--the sun--and we know that the\r\nexistence of those planets is no mere accident, but the result of the\r\noperation of physical laws which must hold good in every instance of\r\nnebular condensation.\r\n\r\nTwo different methods are presented in which a rotating and contracting\r\nnebula may shape itself into a stellar or planetary system. The first is\r\nthat described by Laplace, and generally accepted as the probable manner\r\nof origin of the solar system--viz., the separation of rings from the\r\ncondensing mass, and the subsequent transformation of the rings into\r\nplanets. The planet Saturn is frequently referred to as an instance of\r\nthe operation of this law, in which the evolution has been arrested\r\nafter the separation of the rings, the latter having retained the ring\r\nform instead of breaking and collecting into globes, forming in this\r\ncase rings of meteorites, and reminding us of the comparatively\r\nscattered rings of asteroids surrounding the sun between the orbits of\r\nMars and Jupiter. This Laplacean process Dr. See regards as\r\ntheoretically possible, but apparently he thinks that if it took place\r\nit was confined to our system.\r\n\r\nThe other method is that of the separation of the original rotating mass\r\ninto two nearly equal parts. The mechanical possibility of such a\r\nprocess has been proved, mathematically, by Poincaré and Darwin. This,\r\nDr. See thinks, is the method which has prevailed among the stars, and\r\nprevailed to such a degree as to make the solar system, formed by the\r\nring method, probably a unique phenomenon in the universe.\r\n\r\nIs it not more probable that both methods have been in operation, and\r\nthat, in fact, the ring method has operated more frequently than the\r\nother? If not, why do the single stars so enormously outnumber the\r\ndouble ones? It is of the essence of the fission process that the\r\nresulting masses should be comparable in size. If, then, that process\r\nhas prevailed in the stellar universe to the practical exclusion of the\r\nother, there should be very few single stars; whereas, as a matter of\r\nfact, the immense majority of the stars are single. And, remembering\r\nthat the sun viewed from stellar distances would appear unattended by\r\nsubsidiary bodies, are we not justified in concluding that its origin is\r\na type of the origin of the other single stars?\r\n\r\nWhile it is, as I have remarked, of the essence of the fission process\r\nthat the resulting parts of the divided mass should be comparable in\r\nmagnitude, it is equally of the essence of the ring, or Laplacean\r\nprocess, that the bodies separated from the original mass should be\r\ncomparatively insignificant in magnitude.\r\n\r\nAs to the coexistence of the two processes, we have, perhaps, an example\r\nin the solar system itself. Darwin's demonstration of the possible birth\r\nof the moon from the earth, through fission and tidal friction, does not\r\napply to the satellites attending the other planets. The moon is\r\nrelatively a large body, comparable in that respect with the earth,\r\nwhile the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, for instance, are relatively\r\nsmall. But in the case of Saturn there is visible evidence that the ring\r\nprocess of satellite formation has prevailed. The existing rings have\r\nnot broken up, but their very existence is a testimony of the origin of\r\nthe satellites exterior to them from other rings which did break up.\r\nThus we need not go as far away as the stars in order to find instances\r\nillustrating both the methods of nebular evolution that we have been\r\ndealing with.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion, then, seems to be that we are not justified in assuming\r\nthat the solar system is unique simply because it differs widely from\r\nthe double and multiple star systems; and that we should rather regard\r\nit as probable that the vast multitude of stars which do not appear,\r\nwhen viewed with the telescope, or studied by spectroscopic methods, to\r\nhave any attendants comparable with themselves in magnitude, have\r\noriginated in a manner resembling that of the sun's origin, and may be\r\nthe centers of true planetary systems like ours. The argument, I think,\r\ngoes further than to show the mere possibility of the existence of such\r\nplanetary systems surrounding the single stars. If those stars did not\r\noriginate in a manner quite unlike the origin of the sun, then the\r\nexistence of planets in their neighborhood is almost a foregone\r\nconclusion, for the sun could hardly have passed through the process of\r\nformation out of a rotating nebula without evolving planets during its\r\ncontraction. And so, notwithstanding the eccentricities of the double\r\nstars, we may still cherish the belief that there are eyes to see and\r\nminds to think out in celestial space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Double, triple, multiple, and colored stars, star clusters,\r\nnebulæ, and temporary stars will be found arranged under the heads of\r\ntheir respective constellations.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDROMEDA, Map No. 24, 125.\r\n  Stars: alpha, 126.\r\n    gamma, 128.\r\n    , 126. 36, 128.\r\n  Temporary star: 1885, 127.\r\n  Cluster: 457, 128.\r\n  Variable: R, 128.\r\n  Nebula: 116, 126.\r\n\r\nAQUARIUS, Map No. 18, 107.\r\n  Stars: zeta, 106.\r\n    tau, 108.\r\n    psi, 108. 41, 106.\r\n    Sigma 2729, 106.\r\n    Sigma 2745 (12), 106.\r\n    Sigma 2998, 108.\r\n  Variables: R, 108.\r\n    S, 108.\r\n    T, 106.\r\n  Nebulæ: 4628 (Rosse's \"Saturn\"), 108.\r\n    4678, 108.\r\n\r\nAQUILA, Map No. 16, 95.\r\n  Stars: pi, 94.\r\n    11, 94.\r\n    23, 94.\r\n    57, 94.\r\n    Sigma 2644, 94.\r\n    Sigma 2544, 94.\r\n  Cluster: 4440, 94.\r\n  Variables: eta, 94.\r\n    R, 94.\r\n\r\nARGO: Map No. 2, 31; Map No. 7, 55.\r\n  Stars: Sigma 1097, 33.\r\n    Sigma 1146 (5), 35.\r\n  Clusters: 1551, 35.\r\n    1564, 35.\r\n    1571, 35.\r\n    1630, 56.\r\n  Nebula: 1564, 35.\r\n\r\nARIES, Map No. 22, 119.\r\n  Stars: gamma, 118.\r\n    epsilon, 120.\r\n    lambda, 118.\r\n    pi, 118.\r\n    14, 118.\r\n    30, 118.\r\n    41, 118.\r\n    52, 120.\r\n    Sigma 289, 118.\r\n\r\nAURIGA, Map No. 5, 45.\r\n  Stars: alpha (Capella), 44.\r\n    beta (Menkalina), 46.\r\n    epsilon, 50.\r\n    theta, 48.\r\n    lambda, 50.\r\n    14, 50.\r\n    26, 50.\r\n    41, 51.\r\n    Sigma 616, 48.\r\n  Temporary star: 1892, 48.\r\n  Clusters: 996, 51.\r\n    1067, 51.\r\n    1119, 51.\r\n    1166, 51.\r\n    1295, 48.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOÖTES, Map No. 11, 67.\r\n  Stars: alpha (Arcturus), 66.\r\n    delta, 71.\r\n    epsilon (Mirac), 71.\r\n    zeta, 70.\r\n    iota, 71.\r\n    kappa, 71.\r\n    , 71.\r\n    xi, 70.\r\n    pi, 70.\r\n    Sigma 1772, 70.\r\n    Sigma 1890 (39), 71.\r\n    Sigma 1909 (44), 71.\r\n    Sigma 1910 (279), 70.\r\n    Sigma 1926, 71.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMELOPARDALUS, Map No. 25, 133.\r\n  Stars: 1, 134.\r\n    2, 134.\r\n    7, 135.\r\n    Sigma 385, 134.\r\n    Sigma 390, 134.\r\n  Cluster: 940, 135.\r\n\r\nCANES VENATICI, Map No. 26, 137; Map No. 11, 67.\r\n  Stars: 2, 136.\r\n    12 (Cor Caroli), 136.\r\n    Sigma 1606, 136.\r\n    Sigma 1768 (25), 72.\r\n  Cluster: 3936, 72.\r\n  Nebula: 3572, 136.\r\n\r\nCANIS MAJOR, Map No. 2, 31.\r\n  Stars: alpha (Sirius), 30.\r\n    delta, 33.\r\n    , 33.\r\n  Clusters: 1454, 33.\r\n    1479, 33.\r\n    1512, 33.\r\n  Variable: gamma, 33.\r\n  Nebula: 1511, 33.\r\n\r\nCANIS MINOR, Map No. 3, 34.\r\n  Stars: alpha (Procyon), 36.\r\n    14, 36.\r\n    Sigma 1126 (31 Can.

SERVISS_\r\n\r\n    This book says to the amateur, in effect:--\"What if you have not all\r\n    advantages of clockwork and observatory equipment. You may know\r\n    something of the witchery of the heavens even with a little\r\n    telescope of three to five inches aperture!\" \"Pleasures of the\r\n    Telescope\" is popular in style rather than technical. For setting\r\n    forth \"the chief attractions of the starry heavens,\" a complete set\r\n    of star-maps is included, showing \"all the stars visible to the\r\n    naked eye in the regions of sky represented, and in addition some\r\n    stars that can only be seen with optical aid.\" In six chapters these\r\n    twenty-six maps are described so plainly that the amateur can\r\n    readily find all the interesting star-groups, clusters, and nebulæ,\r\n    and also the colored or double stars. In the three concluding\r\n    chapters the moon and planets receive special consideration. In the\r\n    opening chapter the amateur is told how to select and test a glass.\r\n\r\n    _Booklovers Bulletin._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note\r\n\r\n\r\nMinor errors and inconsistencies in punctuation and hyphenation have\r\nbeen silently corrected.\r\n\r\nSome illustrations have been relocated a short distance within the text.\r\n\r\nOriginal page numbers have been retained in the index.\r\n\r\nGreek letters, used to identify stars, are replaced with the full name\r\nof the Greek letter, e.g. alpha. Upper case Greek letters are shown by\r\ncapitalising the initial letter, e.g. Sigma 1126\r\n\r\nA caret (^) is used to represent superscripts, e.g. nu^1 and nu^2\r\n\r\nThe following minor corrections have also been made:\r\n\r\np3: \"wil\" has been corrected to \"will\".\r\n\r\np28: Sigma 629 is not shown on Map No. 1. The location of _m_ Orionis\r\nis marked as Sigma 696. This inconsistency has not been corrected.\r\n\r\np54: \"for colors\" has been corrected to \"four colors\".\r\n\r\np68: \"1,065,790,250,000,000\" has been corrected to\r\n\"1,065,702,500,000,000\".\r\n\r\np163-164: \"magnical\" has been corrected to \"magical\".\r\n\r\np179: A repeated \"and\" has been removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Pleasures of the telescope, by Garrett Serviss",
