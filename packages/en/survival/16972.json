The supposed enemy was\r\nrepresented by the Channel Squadron, under the command of Vice-Admiral\r\nBaird, and consisting of H.M.S. Northumberland (flag ship), the\r\nAgincourt, Monarch, Iron Duke, and Curlew. The \"general idea\" of the\r\noperations was that a hostile fleet was known to be cruising in the\r\nvicinity, and that an attack on the Rock might be made. The squadron\r\nleft Gibraltar and proceeded to the westward, returning to the\r\neastward through the Straits under cover of the night.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Gibraltar, General the Hon. Sir Arthur Hardinge,\r\nissued orders for the whole garrison to stand to their arms at dawn,\r\nand subsequent days, until the attack should be made; but by his\r\nexpress command no batteries were to be manned, or any troops moved\r\nfrom their alarm posts, until the signal was given that an attack was\r\nimminent. The alarm signal ordered was that of three guns fired in\r\nrapid succession from the Upper Signal Station on the summit of the\r\nRock, to be followed, after a short pause, by two more shots. It was a\r\nmatter of complete uncertainty as to the direction from which the\r\nattack would be made.\r\n\r\nEvery detail was carefully carried out, as if the impending attack was\r\na real affair. The telegraphic communication between the various parts\r\nof the Rock was supplemented by signalers; arrangements were made for\r\nthe ready supply of reserve ammunition for all arms; and the medical\r\nauthorities established dressing stations, at numerous points of the\r\nRock, to render \"first aid\" to those who might chance to be numbered\r\namong the \"wounded.\" Day broke with a \"Levanter,\" and the heavy clouds\r\nhanging about rendered any distant view a matter of difficulty.\r\nHowever, before it had become actually daylight the alarm guns gave\r\nnotice that the enemy had been sighted. The troops turned out with\r\ngreat promptitude, being all at their assigned stations in less than a\r\nquarter of an hour, and were shortly ordered to various points\r\ncommanding the east side of the Rock. As day broke, the hostile ships\r\nwere to be discerned steaming in single line ahead, from the northeast,\r\nalong the back of the Rock, and about 5,000 yards from it. The flag\r\nship, followed by the Monarch and the Agincourt, proceeded toward\r\nEuropa Point, while the Iron Duke and the Curlew stood close in to the\r\neastern beach, so as to engage the northern defenses of the fortress.\r\nThe first shot was fired by the flag ship, shortly before six o'clock\r\nin the morning, at the southern defenses. It was replied to, in less\r\nthan three minutes, by the Europa batteries, and very shortly the\r\nengagement became general. The plan of tactics employed by the\r\nsquadron was that of steaming rapidly up and down, and concentrating\r\ntheir fire in turn on the various shore batteries. Later on, the whole\r\nsquadron assembled off Europa Point, and fired broadsides by\r\nelectricity as they steamed past at speed. The spectacle at this\r\nmoment was a very fine one, the roar of the heavy guns of the ships\r\nbeing supplemented by the sharp, rapid report of the quick-firing\r\nguns, which were supposed to be sending a storm of small shell among\r\nthe defenders of the Rock. The incessant rattle of the ships' machine\r\nguns was also heard in the intervals between the thundering broadsides\r\nof heavy ordnance. All the ships were, of course, cleared for action,\r\nwith topmasts and yards sent down, and it is needless to say they\r\nlooked exceedingly workmanlike and formidable.\r\n\r\nThe various batteries on the Rock replied with great vivacity, and the\r\ngeneral effect produced as gun after gun was brought to bear on the\r\nships, and the white smoke wreathed itself round the many crags and\r\nprecipices of the grim old Rock, was a sight long to be remembered.\r\nThe exercise afforded to both branches of the service was undoubtedly\r\nmost instructive. Our illustration is a sketch by Captain Willoughby\r\nVerner from one of the batteries above the Europa Flats, at which\r\npoint the governor took up his position to watch the operations.\r\n--_Illustrated London News._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIBRALTAR AND NEIGHBORHOOD.\r\n\r\nREPORT BY CONSUL SPRAGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that the political situation of Europe seems to be\r\nless threatening among its leading powers, still the uncertainty\r\nprevalent among those who are generally considered the arbiters of\r\npublic affairs has had its influence in contracting the limits of\r\nspeculative adventure, thereby circumscribing the general course of\r\ntrade throughout the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nIn renewing to the department my reports upon the navigation and\r\ngeneral commerce of Gibraltar, I beg to state that there has been a\r\ntolerably fair current business prevailing in American produce during\r\nthe past quarter, consisting chiefly in flour, tobacco, and refined\r\npetroleum in cases, imported direct from New York.\r\n\r\nThe steady demand for American petroleum confirms the fact that\r\nRussian petroleum so far receives but little attention in this market\r\nfrom the regular traders and consumers, so long as supplies from the\r\nUnited States can be regularly imported at reasonable prices. It,\r\nhowever, remains an open question, in the event of lower prices ruling\r\nin the Russian petroleum regions, whether American supplies may not\r\nlater on experience some greater competitive foreign interference.\r\n\r\nAccording to the statistical data, steam vessels of all nationalities\r\nhave continued to make Gibraltar their port of call, not only for\r\norders, but also for replenishing their stock of fuel and provisions,\r\nand in larger numbers than ever before, the number in 1888 having\r\nreached 5,712 steam vessels, measuring in all 5,969,563 tons, while in\r\n1887 the number was only 5,187 steam vessels, with an aggregate\r\ntonnage of 5,372,962. This increase cannot but result in considerable\r\nbenefit to the coal and maritime traffic, which now forms the most\r\nimportant portion of the general commerce of Gibraltar, in spite of\r\nthe keen competition it experiences from other British and foreign\r\ncoaling ports.\r\n\r\nFreights have also advanced in favor of steamship interests, which,\r\nwith higher prices in England for coal, have also caused an advance in\r\nthe price of coal at this port, to the benefit of the coal merchants\r\nand others interested in this important trade. At present the ruling\r\nprice for steam coal is 24s. per ton, deliverable from alongside of\r\ncoal hulks moored in the bay. As near as I have been able to\r\nascertain, the quantity of coal sold in this market during the past\r\nyear for supplying merchant steam vessels has amounted to about\r\n508,000 tons, which is an increase of about 20,000 tons over the year\r\n1887.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that plans have already been submitted to the British\r\ngovernment for the construction of a dry dock in Gibraltar, the matter\r\nremains somewhat in suspense, since it meets with some opposition on\r\nthe part of the British government, which, in face of the European\r\nfever for general arming, seems more inclined to utilize in another\r\nform the expense which such a work would entail upon the imperial\r\ngovernment, by replacing the obsolete ordnance recently removed from\r\nthis fortress and substituting new defenses and guns of the most\r\napproved patterns, a matter which has evidently been receiving, for\r\nsome time past, the special attention of the British military\r\nauthorities, not doubting that the recent visit to the fortress of the\r\nDuke of Cambridge has had some connection with it. In fact, it is\r\nreported that the duke has already expressed the opinion that this\r\nfortress requires a larger number of artillerymen than are quartered\r\nhere at present to man its batteries, and it would seem that this\r\nrecommendation is likely to be carried out.\r\n\r\nIt is yet somewhat too early to venture an opinion regarding the\r\ngrowing crops of cereals in this Spanish neighborhood, but the\r\nagricultural and manufacturing interests in Spain have suffered so\r\nmuch in the past years that the general feeling in Spain continues to\r\ntend toward establishing increased restrictions against foreign\r\ncompetition in her home markets. There is every probability that the\r\nprovinces of Malaga and Granada may shortly be granted the privilege\r\nof cultivating the tobacco plant under government supervision, as an\r\nessay. If properly managed, it may form an important and lucrative\r\nbusiness for those interested in land and agricultural pursuits.\r\n\r\nAfter many consecutive years of heavy outlays, difficulties, and\r\nconstant disappointments, a new English company has recently succeeded\r\nin commencing the construction of a railway from the neighboring\r\nSpanish town of Algeciras to join, via Ronda, the railway station of\r\nBobadilla, on the railroad line toward Malaga. It is presumed that\r\nwhen this railroad will be in running order it will greatly benefit\r\nthis community, especially if the Spanish government should decide to\r\nestablish custom houses at Algeciras and the Spanish lines outside the\r\ngates of this fortress, similar to those existing on the frontiers of\r\nFrance and Portugal.\r\n\r\nThat some idea may be formed of the constant important daily\r\nintercourse which exists between this fortress and Spain, I may state\r\nthat late police statistics show that 1,887,617 passes were issued to\r\nvisitors entering this fortress on daily permits during the year 1888,\r\n1,608,004 entering by the land route and 279,613 by sea. I must,\r\nhowever, observe that the larger portion of these visitors consists of\r\nlaborers, coal heavers, market people, and others engaged in general\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\nA new industry in cork has lately sprung up, in which leading Spanish\r\nand native commercial firms in Gibraltar are directly interested to a\r\nconsiderable extent. Extensive warehouses for the storing of cork wood\r\nand machinery for the manufacture of bottle corks have recently been\r\nestablished at the Spanish lines, about a mile distant from this\r\nfortress, in Spanish territory, where large quantities of cork have\r\nalready been stored. The cork is obtained and collected from the\r\nvaluable trees, which are owned by the representatives of some of the\r\noldest nobility of Spain, who have sold the products of their\r\nextensive woods to private individuals for periods reaching as far on\r\nas ten years, for which concession large cash advances have already\r\nbeen made. The woods commence at a distance of about twelve miles from\r\nGibraltar, and are of considerable extent.\r\n\r\nThe railway now in course of construction passes through these woods,\r\nwhich may ere long offer quite picturesque scenery for travelers,\r\nespecially when the cork trees are bearing acorns, which form the\r\nprincipal food for the fattening of large herds of swine during\r\ncertain seasons of the year, in this way, also, contributing to the\r\nvalue of this tree, which, like the other kinds of oak trees, is of\r\nlong and tardy growth. The tree from which the cork is obtained is\r\nsomewhat abundant in the mountainous districts of Andalusia. It grows\r\nto a height of about 30 feet, and resembles the _Quercus ilex_, or\r\nevergreen oak, and attains to a great age. After arriving at a certain\r\nstate of maturity it periodically sheds its bark, but this bark is\r\nfound to be of better quality when artificially removed from the tree,\r\nwhich may be effected without injury to the tree itself. After the\r\ntree has attained twenty-five years it may be barked, and the\r\noperation is afterward repeated once in every seven years. The quality\r\nof the cork seems to improve with the increasing age of the tree,\r\nwhich is said to live over one hundred and fifty years. The bark is\r\ntaken off during July and August.\r\n\r\nCork dust is also obtained from this cork wood, and is much used in\r\nthe packing of grapes, which fruit is largely shipped from the eastern\r\ncoast of Spain, especially from Almeria, during the vintage seasons,\r\nfor the American and British markets.--_Reports of U.S. Consuls._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIBRALTAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe point or rock known as Gibraltar is a promontory two and one-half\r\nmiles long and from a quarter to three-quarters of a mile wide. It\r\nrises abruptly from the sandy shore to a height at its highest point\r\nof 1,408 ft. It is composed of gray limestone, honeycombed with caves\r\nand subterranean passages, some of which contain most beautiful\r\nstalactites in the form of massive pillars.\r\n\r\nGibraltar is emphatically a fortress, and in some respects its\r\nfortifications are unique. On the eastern side the rock needs no\r\ndefense beyond its own precipitous cliffs, and in all other directions\r\nit has been rendered practically impregnable. Besides a sea wall\r\nextending at intervals round the western base of the rock, and\r\nstrengthened by curtains and bastions and three formidable forts,\r\nthere are batteries in all available positions from the sea wall up to\r\nthe summit, 1,350 feet above the sea, and a remarkable series of\r\ngalleries has been hewn out of the solid face of the rock toward the\r\nnorth and northwest. These galleries have an aggregate length of\r\nbetween two and three miles, and their breadth is sufficient to let a\r\ncarriage pass. Portholes are cut at intervals of twelve yards, so\r\ncontrived that the gunners are safe from the shot of any possible\r\nassailants. At the end of one of the galleries hollowed out in a\r\nprominent part of the cliff is St. George's Hall, 50 feet long by 85\r\nfeet wide, in which the governor was accustomed to give fetes.\r\nAlterations, extensions, and improvements are continually taking place\r\nin the defensive system, and new guns of the most formidable sort are\r\ngradually displacing or supplementing the old fashioned ordnance.\r\n\r\nThe whole population of Gibraltar, whether civil or military, is\r\nsubjected to certain stringent rules. For even a day's sojourn the\r\nalien must obtain a pass from the town major, and if he wish to remain\r\nlonger, a consul or householder must become security for his good\r\nbehavior. Licenses of residence are granted only for short\r\nperiods--ten, fifteen, or twenty days--but they can be renewed if\r\noccasion require. Military officers may introduce a stranger for\r\nthirty days. A special permit is necessary if the visitor wishes to\r\nsketch.\r\n\r\nThough the town of Gibraltar may be said to date from the fourteenth\r\ncentury, it has preserved very little architectural evidence of its\r\nantiquity. Rebuilt on an enlarged and improved plan after its almost\r\ncomplete destruction during the great siege, it is still, on the\r\nwhole, a mean-looking town, with narrow streets and lanes and an\r\nincongruous mixture of houses after the English and the Spanish types.\r\nAs a proprietor may at any moment be called upon to give up his house\r\nand ground at the demand of the military authorities, he is naturally\r\ndeterred from spending his money on substantial or sumptuous\r\nerections. The area of the town is about one hundred acres.\r\n\r\nGibraltar was known to the Greek and Roman geographers as Calpe or\r\nAlybe, the two names being probably corruptions of the same local\r\n(perhaps Phenician) word. The eminence on the African coast near\r\nCeuta, which bears the modern English name of Apes' Hill, was then\r\ndesignated Abyla; and Calpe and Abyla, at least according to an\r\nancient and widely current interpretation, formed the renowned pillars\r\nof Hercules (Herculis columnæ), which for centuries were the limits of\r\nenterprise to the seafaring peoples of the Mediterranean world.\r\n\r\nThe strategic importance of the rock appears to have been first\r\ndiscovered by the Moors, who, when they crossed over from Africa in\r\nthe eighth century, selected it as the site of a fortress. From their\r\nleader, Tarik Ibn Zeyad, it was called Gebel Tarik or Tarik's Hill;\r\nand, though the name had a competitor in Gebel af Futah, or Hill of\r\nthe Entrance, it gradually gained acceptance, and still remains\r\nsufficiently recognizable in the corrupted form of the present day.\r\nThe first siege of the rock was in 1309, when it was taken by Alonzo\r\nPerez de Guzman for Ferdinand IV. of Spain, who, in order to attract\r\ninhabitants to the spot, offered an asylum to swindlers, thieves, and\r\nmurderers, and promised to levy no taxes on the import or export of\r\ngoods. The attack of Ismail Ben Ferez, in 1315 (second siege), was\r\nfrustrated; but in 1333 Vasco Paez de Meira, having allowed the\r\nfortifications and garrison to decay, was obliged to capitulate to\r\nMahomet IV. (third siege). Alphonso's attempts to recover possession\r\n(fourth siege) were futile, though pertinacious and heroic, and he was\r\nobliged to content himself with a tribute for the rock from Abdul\r\nMelek of Granada; but after his successful attack on Algeciras in 1344\r\nhe was encouraged to try his fortune again at Gibraltar. In 1349 he\r\ninvested the rock, but the siege (fifth siege) was brought to an\r\nuntimely close by his death from the plague in February, 1350. The\r\nnext or sixth siege resulted simply in the transference of the coveted\r\nposition from the hands of the King of Morocco to those of Yussef III.\r\nof Granada; and the seventh, undertaken by the Spanish Count of\r\nNiebla, Enrico de Guzman, proved fatal to the besieger and his forces.\r\nIn 1462, however, success attended the efforts of Alphonso de Arcos\r\n(eighth siege), and in August the rock passed once more under\r\nChristian sway. The Duke of Medina Sidonia, a powerful grandee who had\r\nassisted in its capture, was anxious to get possession of the\r\nfortress, and though Henry IV. at first managed to maintain the claims\r\nof the crown, the duke ultimately made good his ambition by force of\r\narms (ninth siege), and in 1469 the king was constrained to declare\r\nhis son and his heirs perpetual governors of Gibraltar. In 1479\r\nFerdinand and Isabella made the second duke Marquis of Gibraltar, and\r\nin 1492 the third duke, Don Juan, was reluctantly allowed to retain\r\nthe fortress. At length, in 1501, Garcilaso de la Vega was ordered to\r\ntake possession of the place in the king's name, and it was formally\r\nincorporated with the domains of the crown. After Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella were both dead the duke, Don Juan, tried in 1506 to recover\r\npossession, and added a tenth to the list of sieges. Thirty-four years\r\nafterward the garrison had to defend itself against a much more\r\nformidable attack (eleventh siege)--the pirates of Algiers having\r\ndetermined to recover the rock for Mahomet and themselves. The\r\nconflict was severe, but resulted in the repulse of the besiegers.\r\nAfter this the Spaniards made great efforts to strengthen the place,\r\nand they succeeded so well that throughout Europe Gibraltar was\r\nregarded as impregnable.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the war of the Spanish succession, however, it was\r\ntaken by a combined English and Dutch fleet under Sir George Rooke,\r\nassisted by a body of troops under Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt.\r\nThe captors had ostensibly fought in the interests of Charles Archduke\r\nof Austria (afterward Charles III.), but, though his sovereignty over\r\nthe rock was proclaimed on July 24, 1704, Sir George Rooke on his own\r\nresponsibility caused the English flag to be hoisted, and took\r\npossession in name of Queen Anne. It is hardly to the honor of England\r\nthat it was both unprincipled enough to sanction and ratify the\r\noccupation and ungrateful enough to leave unrewarded the general to\r\nwhose unscrupulous patriotism the acquisition was due. The Spaniards\r\nkeenly felt the injustice done to them, and the inhabitants of the\r\ntown of Gibraltar in great numbers abandoned their homes rather than\r\nrecognize the authority of the invaders. In October, 1704, the rock\r\nwas invested by sea and land; but the Spanish ships were dispersed by\r\nSir John Leake, and the Marquis of Villadarias fared so ill with his\r\nforces that he was replaced by Marshal Tesse, who was at length\r\ncompelled to raise the siege in April, 1705. During the next twenty\r\nyears there were endless negotiations for the peaceful surrender of\r\nthe fortress, and in 1726 the Spaniards again appealed to arms. But\r\nthe Conde de la Torres, who had the chief command, succeeded no better\r\nthan his predecessors, and the defense of the garrison under General\r\nClayton and the Earl of Portmore was so effectual that the armistice\r\nof June 23 practically put a close to the siege, though two years\r\nelapsed before the general pacification ensued. The most memorable\r\nsiege of Gibraltar, indeed one of the most memorable of all sieges,\r\nwas that which it sustained from the combined land and sea forces of\r\nFrance and Spain during the years 1779-1783. The grand attack on the\r\nplace was made on the 13th September, 1782, and all the resources of\r\npower and science were exhausted by the assailants in the fruitless\r\nattempt. On the side of the sea they brought to bear against the\r\nfortress forty-six sail of the line and a countless fleet of gun and\r\nmortar boats. But their chief hope lay in the floating batteries\r\nplanned by D'Arcon, an eminent French engineer, and built at the cost\r\nof half a million sterling. They were so constructed as to be\r\nimpenetrable by the red hot shot which it was foreseen the garrison\r\nwould employ; and such hopes were entertained of their efficiency that\r\nthey were styled invincible. The Count D'Artois (afterward Charles X.)\r\nhastened from Paris to witness the capture of the place. He arrived in\r\ntime to see the total destruction of the floating batteries and a\r\nconsiderable portion of the combined fleet by the English fire.\r\nDespite this disaster, however, the siege continued till brought to a\r\nclose by the general pacification, February 2, 1783. The history of\r\nthe four eventful years' siege is fully detailed in the work of\r\nDrinkwater, who himself took part in the defense, and in the life of\r\nits gallant defender Sir George Augustus Eliott, afterward Lord\r\nHeathfield, whose military skill and moral courage place him among the\r\nbest soldiers and noblest men whom Europe produced during the 18th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nSince 1783 the history of Gibraltar has been comparatively uneventful.\r\nIn the beginning of 1801 there were rumors of a Spanish and French\r\nattack, but the Spanish ships were defeated off Algeciras in June by\r\nAdmiral Saumarez. Improvements in the fortifications, maintenance of\r\nmilitary discipline, and legislation in regard to trade and smuggling\r\nare the principal matters of recent interest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRANZ JOSEF I., NEW WAR SHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother addition was made to the Austrian navy by the launching on May\r\n18 of the ram cruiser Franz Josef I. from the yards of S. Rocco in the\r\nStabilimento Tecnico Triestino. Her dimensions are: Length (over all),\r\n103.7 meters; length (between perpendiculars), 97.9 meters; greatest\r\nbreadth (outside), 14.8 meters; draught (bow), 5.28 meters; draught\r\n(stern), 6.05 meters; displacement on the construction water line,\r\n4,000 tons. The armament consists of two 24-centimeter and six\r\n15-centimeter Krupp breech loaders of 35 caliber length, two\r\n7-centimeter Uchatius guns as an armament for the boats and for\r\nlanding purposes, eleven Hotchkiss quick-firing guns, and several\r\ntorpedo-launching ports; indicated horse power with natural draught\r\n6,400, speed 17.5 knots; with forced draught 9,800, speed 19 knots.\r\n\r\nThe ship is built of steel, and constructed according to the \"double\r\nbottom\" system along the engine, boiler, and ammunition rooms. The\r\nvaulted armor deck, extending 1.25 meters below the water line and\r\nprotecting the most vital parts of the ship, is 0.057 meter thick.\r\nThere are more than 100 water tight compartments below and above the\r\ndeck. A protecting belt of \"cellulose\" is provided for the engines and\r\nboilers, extending from the armor deck downward.\r\n\r\nThe two main guns, placed on Krupp's hydraulic carriages, occupy\r\npositions in front and rear, and are protected by stands 0.09 meter\r\nthick and 1.60 meters high. They fire _en barbette_ with a lateral\r\nrange each of 260 degrees at bow and stern--i.e., 130 degrees on\r\neither of the broadsides. The weight of the barrel of the gun is 25\r\ntons, that of the steel shell 215 kilogrammes (about 430 lb.), that of\r\nthe brown powder charge 100 kilogrammes; initial velocity of\r\nprojectile, 610 meters; penetration, 0.524 meter iron; longest range,\r\n17 kilometers (about 10½ English miles); range at 15 deg. elevation,\r\n10 kilometers. The six 15-centimeter guns are placed in a kind of\r\nmachicouli arrangement in two tiers on each of the broadsides, so that\r\nalways four guns can fire in the direction of the keel to the front\r\nand rear. The weight of the barrel of the gun is each six tons, that\r\nof the steel shells 51 kilogrammes, that of the charge 22 kilogrammes;\r\ninitial velocity, 610 meters.\r\n\r\nThe 11 quick-firing guns are partly placed along the broadsides,\r\npartly in the masts, of which there are two. The triple expansion\r\nengines, having each a bronze screw of 4.42 meters diameter, with\r\nthree blades and a rise of 6.3 meters, make with natural draught 105\r\nrevolutions, and with forced draught 120. The pumping apparatus are\r\nable to lift in one hour 400 tons of water. The front boiler room\r\ncontains a special cylindrical boiler for the working of the\r\nelectrical apparatus, for hydraulic pumps of the artillery service,\r\nfor anchor windlasses, ventilators, fire engines, etc. The whole\r\nengines weigh 890 tons. The bunkers have a capacity for 660 tons of\r\ncoal, which allows for a run of 4,500 sea miles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLARK'S GYROSCOPIC TORPEDOES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigs. 1 and 2 represent, upon a scale of about 1/10, two types of\r\ntorpedoes, the greatest number possible of the parts of which are made\r\nrevolvable, so as to render the torpedoes as dirigible as the gyrating\r\nmotion permits of.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 represents an electric torpedo actuated by accumulators, A A,\r\nkeyed upon the shaft, and revolving along with the gearings. At the\r\nbeginning of the running, the accumulators are not all coupled, but\r\nunder the action of a clockwork movement which is set in motion at the\r\nmoment of starting, metallic brushes descend one after another upon\r\nthe collectors, B, and set in action new batteries for keeping\r\nconstant or, if need be, accelerating the speed at the end of the\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. CLARK'S GYROSCOPIC TORPEDOES.]\r\n\r\nFig. 2 represents an air torpedo proposed by the same inventor. The\r\nair reservoir, C, revolves along with the gearings under the action\r\nof the pneumatic machine, D. The central shaft is hollow, so as to\r\nserve as a conduit. The admission of air into the slide valve of the\r\nmachine is regulated by a clockwork which actuates a slide in an\r\naperture whose form and dimensions are so calculated that the speed\r\nremains as constant as possible toward the end of the travel.\r\n\r\nThe trajectory of the two torpedoes is regulated by a cylindrical\r\nbellows, F, which gives entrance to the sea water. The springs shown\r\nin the figure balance the hydraulic pressure. The tension of these\r\nsprings is regulated by the rod, H, according to the indications of\r\nthe scale of depths, I.\r\n\r\nWhen the torpedo reaches too great a depth, the action of the springs\r\ncan no longer balance the increase of the hydraulic pressure, and the\r\naccumulation of the charge in the rear causes the front to rise toward\r\nthe surface. When the torpedo reaches the surface, a contrary action\r\nis produced.--_Revue Industrielle._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STEAMBOAT ON THE SEINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST STEAMBOAT BUILT ON THE SEINE.]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying engraving represents the remarkable steamboat that\r\nthe unfortunate Marquis de Jouffroy constructed at Paris in 1816,\r\nafter organizing a company for the carriage of passengers on the\r\nSeine. De Jouffroy, as well known, made the first experiment in steam\r\nnavigation at Lyons in 1783, but the inventor's genius was not\r\nrecognized, and he met with nothing but deception and hostility. With\r\nthe obstinacy of men of conviction, he did not cease to prosecute his\r\ntask. He assuredly had an inkling of the future in store for the\r\ninvention that he was offering to humanity.\r\n\r\nThe paddle wheel boat that he constructed at Paris in 1816 did not\r\nsucceed any better than its predecessors; it was remarkable\r\nnevertheless in appearance and structure.\r\n\r\nThe engine was forward, as shown in the engraving, which is copied\r\nfrom a composition of Dubucourt's.\r\n\r\nThe company organized by the marquis was ruined, and, as well known,\r\nthe unfortunate inventor himself died in poverty in 1832, at the age\r\nof eighty-one years.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC MOTOR TESTS ON THE NEW YORK ELEVATED RAILROAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Institute of Electrical Engineers at its last meeting of\r\nthe season, held June 25, again considered the subject of electrical\r\ntraction, the paper presented by Mr. Leo Daft being based upon some\r\nrecent electrical work on the elevated railroads and its bearing on\r\nthe rapid transit problem. The _Railroad Gazette_ gives the following\r\nabstract:\r\n\r\n    He introduced the subject with a tribute to the efficiency of\r\n    the elevated railroad system as it is now operated by steam,\r\n    with special reference to that section of it known as the Ninth\r\n    Avenue line, upon which his experiments with the electric motor\r\n    have been conducted, over which passengers are now conveyed a\r\n    distance of five miles in 26 minutes for five cents, which he\r\n    considered the best and cheapest municipal rapid transit in the\r\n    world, and which is operated with a higher degree of safety than\r\n    any other railroad in the world making an equal number of stops\r\n    per 100 miles. On a recent holiday, April 30 last, 835,720\r\n    passengers were carried upon the entire system without\r\n    noticeable detention or accident. The rapidly increasing traffic\r\n    makes the demand for better facilities a pressing one, and as\r\n    the average half million now carried daily will soon become a\r\n    million, it appears doubtful if any method can be devised of\r\n    providing for the growth by the use of steam motors on the\r\n    present structures, which are now taxed to their utmost. To the\r\n    mind of the mechanical engineer, having in view the ordinary\r\n    coefficients of tractive ability, there is no remedy for this.\r\n    The speaker stated that these coefficients were not entirely\r\n    trustworthy. He reiterated his previously expressed opinion,\r\n    based on frequent experiments, that there is a decided increase\r\n    in traction gained by the passage of the electric current from\r\n    the wheels to the rails, giving the details of one test where a\r\n    motor with a load making a total of 600 lb. climbed a gradient\r\n    of 2,900 ft. per mile, starting from a state of rest. He stated\r\n    that some of those people who had ridiculed his statements had\r\n    finally admitted that they were true.\r\n\r\n    The motor Ben Franklin, which had been used in making these\r\n    tests on the elevated roads, weighed 10 tons, and performed\r\n    service nearly equal to the steam motors weighing 18 tons. The\r\n    object of these tests was the determination of coal economy.\r\n    Tests with a Prony brake showed that the motor developed 128\r\n    H.P. The piece of track on which the experiments were conducted\r\n    embraced 2,200 ft. of level track and 1-8/10 miles of gradients,\r\n    varying from 11-3/10 to 98-7/10 ft. per mile, while at Thirtieth\r\n    street the station is at the foot of the steepest grade, thus\r\n    testing to the utmost the tractive capacity of the motor. The\r\n    experiments were begun in October, 1888, and carried on between\r\n    the hours of 9 P.M. and 4 A.M., beginning with one or two cars,\r\n    the load being increased nightly until it was finally made up of\r\n    eight coaches of 12 tons each, which were hauled up the 98 ft.\r\n    grade at a speed of 7½ miles per hour, the entire distance being\r\n    covered at the rate of 14-6/10 miles per hour. The maximum speed\r\n    obtained on level with that train was 16.36 miles per hour.\r\n    Seventy trips were subsequently made with a 70 ton train\r\n    operated between the steam trains under 3 minutes headway, but\r\n    the work was considered too critical on account of the absence\r\n    of suitable brakes. A number of experiments made about this time\r\n    showed that the mean speed with a three-car train running\r\n    express on the up-town track was about 24 miles per hour,\r\n    although the ability of the motor on a level with a similar\r\n    train was nearly 28 miles per hour. This, however, was not the\r\n    maximum speed, as the level track was not long enough to permit\r\n    of its attaining the highest rate. It was the opinion of the\r\n    speaker, however, that the speed attained could not be exceeded\r\n    with prudence on the elevated structure.\r\n\r\n    The measurements of speed were made by dividing the track into\r\n    19 sections of 500 ft., each section being provided with a\r\n    circuit-closing plate connected with a chronograph which was\r\n    carefully tested. The indicator cards were taken at the central\r\n    station by Mr. Idell and his assistants, and the dynamometer\r\n    used was of the liquid type made by Mr. Shaw, of Philadelphia.\r\n    The diagrams prepared from the data obtained were then explained\r\n    by the speaker, who stated that there was not a marked\r\n    difference between the 10 ton motor and the 18 ton locomotive in\r\n    the initial effort on the level, as will be seen by comparing a\r\n    run observed by a railroad officer on March 9 with a steam motor\r\n    and a load of about 57½ tons. The steam motor required 1 min.\r\n    and 29 sec. to make the distance from 14th to 23d streets, while\r\n    the electric motor with a train of 70 tons made the same trip in\r\n    1 min. and 50 sec.; the absence of power brakes compelled the\r\n    current to be taken off at 19th street, while it was probable\r\n    that the throttle of the steam locomotive was not closed until\r\n    it reached 23d street, this being the usual practice. The data\r\n    obtained in these experiments shows that 29,940 h.p. is required\r\n    to operate the Ninth avenue railroad for the 16 hours' service,\r\n    or an average of 1,871 h.p. per hour, or 2,181 h.p., adding\r\n    station friction. The varying requirements of the traffic during\r\n    the day shows that the service could be advantageously divided\r\n    up between four stationary engines of 800 h.p. each, there being\r\n    but five hours of the day when all of them would be required.\r\n    The fuel consumption per day, allowing 22 lb. of coal per h.p.\r\n    per hour at $2.25 per ton, would make a total of $92.25 per diem\r\n    for fuel, the coal being a mixture deliverable at the dock for\r\n    about $1.80 per ton. The weight of coal used for the present\r\n    locomotives is about the same, viz., 40 tons per day, but\r\n    practice has shown it to be most economical to use coal of the\r\n    best quality, costing $5 per ton, making the cost of fuel about\r\n    double that required for the electric system. Without entering\r\n    into other economies which the speaker claimed were in favor of\r\n    electricity, and ignoring the plan suggested by Sir William\r\n    Siemens of braking the train by converting the motor into a\r\n    dynamo and thus utilizing the energy of momentum, he believed\r\n    that the economy in fuel alone was sufficient to prove that the\r\n    application of power by electricity was preferable to direct\r\n    steam propulsion for the elevated railroad service.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETISM IN ITS RELATION TO INDUCED ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE AND\r\nCURRENT.[1]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: A paper read before the American Institute of\r\n   Electrical Engineers, New York, May 22, 1889.]\r\n\r\nBy ELIHU THOMSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no subject which at the present time can have a\r\ngreater interest to the physicist, the electrician, and the electrical\r\nengineer than the one which heads this paper. The advances which have\r\nbeen made in the study from its purely theoretical or scientific side,\r\nand the great technical progress in the utilization of the known facts\r\nand principles concerning magnetic inductions, can but deepen and\r\nstrengthen that interest.\r\n\r\nOn the side of pure theory we find the eager collection of\r\nexperimental data to be submitted to the scrutiny of the ablest and\r\nbrightest minds, to be examined and reasoned upon with the hope of\r\nfinding some clew to satisfying explanations, and on the side of\r\npractice we find the search for new facts and relations no less\r\ndiligent, though often stimulated by practical problems presented for\r\nsolution. Indeed, the urgency for results is often the greater on the\r\npractical side, for theory can wait, practice cannot, at least in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWe must look for continued triumphs in both directions, and the most\r\nwelcome of all will be the framing of a theory or explanation which\r\nwill enable us to interpret magnetic and electric phenomena. The\r\nrecent beautiful experiments of Hertz on magnetic waves have opened a\r\nfertile region for investigation.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the study of magnetism and electricity will give us\r\nthe ability to investigate the ether of space, which medium has been\r\ntheorized upon at great length, with the result of leaving it very\r\nmuch where it was before, a mysterious necessity.\r\n\r\nFaraday says, speaking of magnetism:\r\n\r\n    \"Such an action may be a function of the ether, for it is not at\r\n    all unlikely that if there be an ether it should have other uses\r\n    than simply the conveyance of radiations.\" 3,075. Vol. III.,\r\n    Exp. Res.\r\n\r\n    \"It may be a vibration of the hypothetical ether, or a state of\r\n    tension of that ether equivalent to either a dynamic or a static\r\n    condition,\" etc. 3,263. Vol. III., Exp. Res.\r\n\r\nFaraday again says, speaking of the magnetic power of a vacuum:\r\n\r\n    \"What that surrounding magnetic medium deprived of all material\r\n    substance may be I cannot tell, perhaps the ether.\" 3,277. Vol.\r\n    III., Exp. Res.\r\n\r\nModern views would seem to point that through a study of magnetic\r\nphenomena we may take a feeble hold upon the universal ether.\r\nMagnetism is an action or condition of that medium, and it may be that\r\nelectrical actions are the expression of molecular disturbances\r\nbrought about by ether strains or interferences. The close relations\r\nwhich are shown to exist between magnetism and light tend to\r\nstrengthen such views. Indeed, it would not be too much to expect that\r\nif the mechanics of the ether are ever worked out, we should find the\r\nrelation between sensible heat and electric currents to be as close as\r\nthat of light to magnetism, perhaps find ultimately the forms of\r\nmatter, the elements and compounds to be the more complex\r\nmanifestations of the universal medium--aggregations in stable\r\nequilibrium. It is a difficult conception, I confess, and a most\r\nshadowy and imperfect one, yet facts and inferences which favor such\r\nviews are not wanting.\r\n\r\nOur science of electricity seems almost to be in the same condition\r\nthat chemistry was before the work of Lavoisier had shed its light on\r\nchemical theory. Our store of facts is daily increasing, and\r\napparently disconnected phenomena are being brought into harmonious\r\nrelation. Perhaps the edifice of complete theory will not be more than\r\nbegun in our time, perhaps the building process will be a very gradual\r\none, but I cannot refrain from the conviction that the intelligence of\r\nman will, if it has time, continue its advance until such a structure\r\nexists.\r\n\r\nI have been led to make these general allusions to electrical theory\r\nin order to emphasize the fact that in the present paper no unraveling\r\nof the mystery is to be attempted, but rather the presentation of some\r\nfew considerations upon a subject of absorbing interest.\r\n\r\nThe conception of Faraday in regard to the existence of lines of\r\nmagnetic force representing directions of magnetic strain or tension\r\nin a medium has not only lost nothing of its usefulness up to the\r\npresent time, but has continually been of great service in the\r\nunderstanding of magnetic phenomena. We need spend no time in showing,\r\nas Faraday and others have done, that these lines are always closed\r\ncircuits, polarized so that the direction of the lines cannot be\r\nreversed without reversal of the actions. Nor need we take time to\r\nshow that in any medium the lines are mutually repellent laterally if\r\nof the same direction of polarization. Opposing this tendency to\r\nseparation or lateral diffusion of magnetic force is the strong\r\napparent tendency of the lines to shorten themselves in any medium.\r\nThese actions are distributed by the presentation of a better medium,\r\nas iron instead of space or air. Lines of force will move into the\r\nbetter medium, having apparently the constant tendency to diminish the\r\nresistance in their paths.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar and mysterious nature of media, such as iron, is to\r\npermit an extraordinary crowding of lines on account of slight\r\nresistance to their passage through it. We need not, in addition, do\r\nmore than refer to the other well-known facts of an electric current\r\ndeveloping magnetic lines encircling the conductor, as being the\r\ngeneral type, which includes all forms of magnetic field or\r\nelectro-magnets, sustained by currents, and the fact of a development\r\nwhen magnetic lines or circuits and material masses are in relative\r\nmovement of electromotive forces transversely to the direction of the\r\nlines of magnetism, and also transversely to the direction of relative\r\nmovement, as in the case of electric conductors traversing or cutting\r\nthrough a field, or of a field traversing or being moved across a\r\nconductor. We must not forget that even insulators, as well as\r\nconductors, cutting lines of force, have the electromotive force\r\ndeveloped in them. The action simply develops potential difference,\r\nand this generates the current where a circuit exists. While we are in\r\nthe habit of saying that a conductor moved across a field of lines, or\r\n_vice versa_, generates electric current, I think the statement\r\nincomplete. The movement only sets up a potential difference, and the\r\npower expended in effecting the movement generates C × E. The current\r\nis energy less the potential, or the energy expended gives the two\r\neffects of potential or pressure and current or rate of movement.\r\nConsequently an insulator, or an open-circuited conductor, traversing\r\na field, consumes no energy, potential difference only being produced.\r\nNevertheless, as will be shown, the magnetic circuits or lines\r\nthemselves may furnish the energy for their own movement across a\r\nconductor, and so develop current as well as potential.\r\n\r\nThis occurs in the effort of lines to shorten their paths, to lessen\r\ntheir density, to pass to better media. Indeed, a close examination\r\nwill show that wherever power is expended in developing current in a\r\ncircuit, cutting lines of force, the energy expended is first employed\r\nin stretching the lines, which thus receive the energy required to\r\npermit them, in shortening, to cut the conductor and set up currents\r\nin the electric circuit in accordance with the potential difference\r\ndeveloped in that circuit and its resistance.\r\n\r\nI think we may also say, though I do not remember to have seen the\r\nstatement so put, that whenever electric potential is set up\r\ninductively, as in self-induction, mutual induction, induction from\r\none circuit to another, and induction from magnets or magnetic field,\r\nit is set up by the movement of lines of force laterally across the\r\nbody, mass or conductor in which the potential is developed, and that\r\nwhenever current is set up in a wire or an existing current prolonged,\r\nor an existing current checked by induction, self-induction, or\r\ninduction from magnets, the action is a transfer of energy,\r\nrepresented by strained lines of force shortening or lessening their\r\nresistance, or lengthening and increasing the resistance in their\r\npaths. The magnetic field is like an elastic spring--it can in one\r\ncondition represent stored energy--it can be strained and will store\r\nenergy--it can be made to relieve its strain and impart energy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nLet us examine some known phenomena in this light. Take the case of a\r\nsimple wire, conveying current, say, in a line away from observer,\r\nFig. 1. There exists a free field of circular magnetism (so called),\r\nshading off away from the wire, and which is represented by concentric\r\ncircles of increased diameter. The superior intensity or strength of\r\nthe lines near the wire may also be represented by their thickness.\r\nThis is often shown also by crowding the lines near the wire, though I\r\nam disposed to regard Fig. 1 as more nearly expressing the condition,\r\nunless we are to regard the lines as simply indicating a sort of\r\natmosphere of magnetic effect whose density becomes less as we proceed\r\noutward from the wire, in which case either form of symbol suffices.\r\nThe direction of polarization of the lines may be indicated by an\r\narrow head pointing in a direction of right-handed rotation in the\r\npath of the lines. This is the typical figure or expression for all\r\nforms of simple magnetic circuit--the form of the lines, their length,\r\nposition, density, will depend on the shape of the conductor or\r\nconductors (when more than one) and the materials surrounding or in\r\nproximity to the wire or wires.\r\n\r\nIf the current traversing the conductor is constant, the magnetic\r\nfield around it is stable and static, unless other influences come in\r\nto modify it. The cutting off of the current is followed by\r\ninstability of the field whereby it can and must produce dynamic\r\neffects. I say _must_ because the field represents stored energy, and\r\nin disappearing _must_ give out that energy. To throw light on this\r\npart of the subject is one of the objects of the present paper.\r\nCutting off the current supply in the case assumed leaves the\r\ndeveloped magnetic lines or strains unsupported. They at once shorten\r\ntheir paths or circuits, collapsing upon the conductor as it were, and\r\ncontinuing this action, cut the section of the conductor, and\r\napparently disappear in magnetic closed circuits of infinitesimal\r\ndiameter but of great strength of polarization. It appears to me that\r\nwe must either be prepared to give up the idea of lines of force or\r\ntake the position that the magnetic circuits precipitate themselves in\r\nshortening their circuits and disappearing upon and cut the conductor.\r\nIt was Hughes who put forward the idea that an iron bar in losing its\r\napparent magnetism really short-circuits the lines in itself as\r\ninnumerable strongly magnetized closed circuits among the molecules.\r\nIn becoming magnetic once more these short circuits are opened or\r\nextended into the air by some source of energy applied to strain the\r\nlines, such as a current in a conductor around the bar.\r\n\r\nMay not this idea be extended, then, to include the magnetic medium,\r\nthe ether itself? Does it contain intensely polarized closed circuits\r\nof magnetism which are ready to be stretched or extended under certain\r\nconditions by the application of energy, which energy is returned by\r\nthe collapse of the extended circuits? This is doubtless but a crude\r\nexpression of the real condition of things, for the lines are only\r\nsymbols for a condition of strain in a medium which cannot be\r\nrepresented in thought, as we know nothing of its real nature. There\r\nis one point in this connection which I must emphasize. The strained\r\nlines, Fig. 1, are indications of stored energy in the ether, and the\r\nlines _cannot_ disappear without giving out that energy. Ordinarily,\r\nit makes its appearance as the extra current, and adds itself so as to\r\nprolong the current which extended the lines when an attempt is made\r\nto cut off such current. Were it conceivable that the current could be\r\ncut off and the wire put on open circuit while the lines still\r\nremained open or strained, the energy must still escape when the field\r\ndisappears. It would then produce such a high potential as to be able\r\nto discharge from the ends of the conductor, and if the conductor were\r\nof some section, part of the energy would be expended in setting up\r\nlocal currents in it. The field could not disappear without an outlet\r\nfor the energy it represents. But we cannot cut off a current in a\r\nwire so as to leave the wire on open circuit with the lines of the\r\nmagnetic circuit remaining around it without iron or steel or the like\r\nin the magnetic circuit. We can approach that condition, however, by\r\nbreaking the circuit very quickly with a condenser of limited capacity\r\naround the break. This is done in the Ruhmkorff coil primary; the\r\ncondenser forms a sort of blind alley for the extra current on its\r\nbeginning to flow out of the primary coil. But the condenser charges\r\nand backs up and stops the discharge from the primary, even giving a\r\nreverse current. The lines of magnetic force collapse, however, and\r\nhave their effect in the enormous potential set up in the secondary\r\ncoil.\r\n\r\nTake away the secondary coil so as to stop that outlet, the energy\r\nexpends itself on the iron core and the primary coil. Take away the\r\niron core, and the energy of magnetization of the air or ether core\r\nexpends itself on the wire of the primary and, possibly, also on the\r\ndielectric of the condenser to some extent. The extra current becomes\r\nin this instance an oscillatory discharge of very high period back and\r\nforth through the primary coil from the condenser, until the energy is\r\nlost in the heat of C2 × R. This conversion is doubtless rendered\r\nall the more rapid by uneven distribution of current and eddy current\r\nset up in the wire of the coil.\r\n\r\nThe considerations just given concern the loss of field or the\r\nshortening and apparent disappearance of the magnetic lines or\r\ncircuits, as giving rise to the self-induction or increased potential\r\non breaking. Where the energizing current is slowly cut off or\r\ndiminished the energy is gradually transferred to the wire in\r\nproducing elevation of potential during the decrease; and the collapse\r\nand cutting of the wire by the collapsing circuits or lines is then\r\nonly more gradual.\r\n\r\nLet the current be returned to the wire after disappearance of\r\nmagnetism, and the lines again seem to emanate from the wire and at\r\nthe same time cut it and produce a counter potential in it, which is\r\nthe index of the abstraction of energy from the circuit, and its\r\nstoring up in the form of elastically strained lines of magnetism\r\naround the conductor. The effect is that of self-induction on making\r\nor upon increase of current, the measure of the amount being the\r\nenergy stored in the magnetic circuits which have been extended or\r\nopened up by the current. The greater the current and the shorter the\r\npath for the lines developed around the axis of the conductor, the\r\ngreater the energy stored up. Hence, a circular section conductor has\r\nthe highest self-induction, a tube of same section less as its\r\ndiameter increases, a flat strip has less as its width increases and\r\nthickness diminishes, a divided conductor much less than a single\r\nconductor of same shape and section. Separating the strands of a\r\ndivided conductor increases the length of magnetic paths around it,\r\nand so diminishes the self-induction. A striking instance of this\r\nlatter fact was developed in conveying very heavy alternating currents\r\nof a very low potential a distance of about three feet by copper\r\nconductors, the current being used in electric welding operations.\r\n\r\nThe conductors were built up of flat thin strips of copper for\r\nflexibility. When the strips were allowed to lie closely together, the\r\nshort conductor showed an enormous self-induction, which cut down the\r\neffective potential at its ends near the work. By spreading apart the\r\nstrips so as to lengthen a line around the conductor, the\r\nself-induction could be easily made less than 35 per cent. of what it\r\nhad been before. The interweaving of the outgoing and return conductor\r\nstrands as one compound conductor gets rid almost entirely of the\r\nself-inductive effects, because neither conductor has any free space\r\nin which to develop strong magnetic forces, but is opposed in effect\r\neverywhere by the opposite current in its neighbor.\r\n\r\nWhere a number of conductors are parallel, and have the same direction\r\nof current, as in a coil or in a strand, it is evident that statically\r\nthe conductor may be considered as replaceable by a single conductor\r\nwith the same external dimensions and same total current in the area\r\noccupied, the magnetic forces or lines surrounding them being of same\r\nintensity. But with changing current strength the distribution of\r\ncurrent in the conductor has also a powerful effect on the energy\r\nabsorbed or given out in accordance with the magnetism produced. Hence\r\nthe self-induction of a strand, coil or conductor of the same section\r\nvaries with the rapidity of current changes, owing to the conduction\r\nbeing uneven.\r\n\r\nThe uneven distribution of current, or its tendency to flow on the\r\nouter parts of a conductor when the rate of variation or alternation\r\nis made great, is in itself a consequence of the fact that less energy\r\nis transferred into magnetism in this case than when the current flows\r\nuniformly over the section, or is concentrated at the center. In other\r\nwords, when a uniform current traverses a conductor of the same\r\nsection, the circular magnetism, or surrounding magnetic lines, are to\r\nbe found not only outside the conductor, but also beneath its\r\nexterior. Since in forming these lines on passage of current the\r\nmiddle of section would be surrounded by more lines than any other\r\npart of the conductor, the current tends to keep out of that part and\r\nmove nearer the exterior in greater amount. Hence, in rapidly\r\nalternating currents the conductor section is practically lessened,\r\nbeing restricted largely to the outer metal of the conductor. If the\r\nround conductor, Fig. 2, were made of iron, the magnetism interior to\r\nit and set up by a current in it would be very much greater, the\r\nsection of the conductor being filled with magnetic circuits or lines\r\naround the center. The total magnetism, external and internal, would\r\nbe much greater in this case for a given current flow, and the energy\r\nabsorbed and given out in formation and loss of field or the\r\nself-induction would be much increased. This could, however, be\r\ngreatly diminished by slitting the conductor radially or making it of\r\na number of separate wires out of lateral magnetic contact one with\r\nthe other, Fig. 3. In these cases the resistance of the interior\r\nmagnetic circuits would be increased, as there would be several breaks\r\nin the continuity around the center of the conductor. The total\r\nmagnetism which could be set up by a current would be lessened, and\r\nthe self-induction, therefore, lessened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe moment we begin the bringing of iron into proximity with an\r\nelectric conductor conveying current, we provide a better medium for\r\nthe flow or development of magnetic lines or circuits. In other words,\r\nthe lines may then be longer, yet equally intense, or more lines may\r\nbe crowded into a section of this metal than in air or space. Figs.\r\n4a, 4b, 4c show the effect brought about by bringing iron of\r\ndifferent forms near to the conductor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4a.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4b.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4c.]\r\n\r\nIt shows, in other words, the development of the ordinary\r\nelectro-magnet of the horseshoe form, and the concentration of the\r\nlines in the better medium. The lines also tend to shorten and\r\ndiminish the resistance to their passage, so that attraction of the\r\niron to the conductor takes place, and if there is more than one piece\r\nof iron, they tend to string themselves around the conductor in\r\nmagnetic contact with one another.\r\n\r\nWhen copper bars of 1 inch diameter are traversed by currents of\r\n40,000 to 60,000 amperes, as in welding them, the magnetic forces just\r\nreferred to become so enormous that very heavy masses of iron brought\r\nup to the bar are firmly held, even though the current be of an\r\nalternating character, changing direction many times a second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6]\r\n\r\nWhen a conductor is surrounded by a cast iron ring, as in Fig. 5, the\r\ncurrent in such conductor has an excellent magnetic medium surrounding\r\nit. A large amount of energy is then abstracted on the first impulse\r\nof current, which goes to develop strong and dense magnetic lines\r\nthrough the iron ring and across the gap in it. On taking off the\r\ncurrent the energy is returned as extra current, and its force is many\r\ntimes what would be found with air alone surrounding the conductor. We\r\nhave then greatly increased the self-induction, the storing of energy\r\nand opposition to current flow at the beginning, the giving back of\r\nenergy and assistance to the current flow on attempting to remove or\r\nstop the current. Let us now complete the ring, by making it of iron,\r\nendless, Fig. 6, with the conductor in the middle.\r\n\r\nWe now find that on passing current through the conductor it meets\r\nwith a very strong opposing effect or counter potential. The evolution\r\nof magnetic lines, or the opening out of magnetic circuits, goes on at\r\na very rapid rate. Each line or magnetic circuit evolved, and cutting\r\nthe conductor, flies at once outward, and locates itself in the iron\r\nring. This ring can carry innumerable lines, and they do not crowd one\r\nanother. It permits the lines even to lengthen in reaching it, and\r\nyet, on account of its low resistance to their passage, the\r\nlengthening is equivalent to their having shortened in other media. We\r\nwill suppose the current not sufficient to exhaust this peculiar\r\ncapacity for lines which the iron has. Equilibrium is reached, the\r\nconductor has opened up innumerable closed circuits, and caused them\r\nto exist in the ring still closed; but in iron, not space or ether\r\nmerely. The current passing has continued its action and storage of\r\nenergy until to emit another line in view of the resistance now found\r\nin the crowded iron ring is impossible.\r\n\r\nNow let us cut off the current. We are surprised to find a very weak\r\nextra current, a practical absence of self-induction on breaking, or,\r\nat least, a giving out of energy in nowise comparable to that on\r\nmaking. Let us put on the current as it was before. Another curious\r\nresult. But little self-induction now on making energy not absorbed.\r\n\r\nNow cut off the current again. Same effect as before. Now let us put\r\non the current reversed in direction. At once we find a very strong\r\ncounter potential or opposing self-induction developed.\r\n\r\nThe ring had been polarized, or retained its magnetic energy, and we\r\nare now taking out one set of lines and putting in reversely polarized\r\nlines of force. This done, we break the reversed current without much\r\neffect of self-induction. The ring remains polarized and inert until\r\nan opposite flow of current be sent through. Iron is then a different\r\nmedium from the ether.\r\n\r\nThe ring once magnetized must, in losing its magnetism, permit a\r\nclosure of the lines by shortening. This involves their passage from\r\nthe iron across the space in the center of the ring, notwithstanding\r\nits great resistance to the lines of force. As passage from iron to\r\nair is equivalent to lengthening of the lines, it is readily seen that\r\nsuch lengthening may oppose more effect than a slight shortening due\r\nto leaving iron, for air or space may give in provoking a closure and\r\ndisappearance of the lines. Looked at from another standpoint, the\r\nlines on the iron may actually require a small amount of initial\r\nenergy to dislodge them therefrom, so that after being dislodged they\r\nmay collapse and yield whatever energy they represent.\r\n\r\nI must reserve for the future further consideration of the iron ring,\r\nbut in thinking upon this matter I am led to think that the production\r\nof a magnetic line in an iron ring around a conductor may represent a\r\nsort of wave of energy, an absorption of energy on the evolution of\r\nthe line from the conductor, and a slight giving out of energy on the\r\nline reaching that position of proximity to the iron ring, that its\r\npassage thereto may be said to be a shortening process or a lessening\r\nof its resistance.\r\n\r\nThe magnetism in air, gases, and non-magnetic bodies, being assumed to\r\nbe that of the ether, this medium shows no such effects as those we\r\nget with the ring. It does not become permanently polarized, as does\r\neven soft iron under the condition of a closed ring. The iron\r\npossesses coercive force, or magnetic rigidity, and a steel ring would\r\nshow more of it. The molecules of the iron or steel take a set. If we\r\nwere to cut the soft iron ring, or separate it in any way, this\r\nintroduction of resistance of air for ether in the magnetic circuit\r\nwould cause the lines to collapse and set up a current in the\r\nconductor. The energy of the ring would have been restored to the\r\nlatter. The curious thing is that physically the polarized ring does\r\nnot present any different appearance or ordinary properties different\r\nfrom those of a plain ring, and will not deflect a compass needle. Its\r\ncondition is discoverable, however, by the test of self-induction to\r\ncurrents of different direction. As a practical consideration, we may\r\nmention in this connection that a self-inductive coil for currents of\r\none direction must be constructed differently from one to be used with\r\nalternating currents. The former must have in its magnetic circuit a\r\nsection of air or the like, or be an imperfectly closed circuit, as it\r\nwere. The latter should have as perfectly closed a magnetic circuit as\r\ncan be made. We see here also the futility of constructing a Ruhmkorff\r\ncore coil on the closed iron magnetic circuit plan, because the\r\ncurrents in the primary are interrupted, not reversed.\r\n\r\nThe considerations just put forward in relation to the closed iron\r\nring, and its passive character under the condition of becoming\r\npolarized, are more important than at first appears. It has been found\r\nthat the secondary current wave of a closed iron circuit induction\r\ncoil or transformer, whose primary circuit receives alternating\r\ncurrent, is lagged from its theoretical position of 90 degrees behind\r\nthe primary wave an additional 90 degrees, so that the phases of the\r\ntwo currents are directly opposed; or the secondary current working\r\nlamps only in its circuit is one half a wave length behind a primary,\r\ninstead of a quarter wave length, as might have been expected.\r\n\r\nBut when it is understood that the iron core polarized in one\r\ndirection by the primary impulse does not begin to lose its magnetism\r\nwhen that impulse simply weakens, but waits until an actual reversal\r\nof current has taken place, it will be seen that the secondary\r\ncurrent, which can only be produced when magnetic lines are leaving\r\nthe core and cutting the secondary coil, or when the lines are being\r\nevolved and passing into the core from the primary coil, will have a\r\nbeginning at the moment the primary reverses, will continue during the\r\nflow of that impulse, and will end at substantially the same time with\r\nthe primary impulse, provided the work of the secondary current is not\r\nexpended in overcoming self-induction, which would introduce a further\r\nlag. Moreover, the direction of the secondary current will be opposite\r\nto that of the primary, because the magnetic circuits which are opened\r\nup by the primary current in magnetizing the core, or which are closed\r\nor collapsed by it in demagnetizing the core, will always cut the\r\nsecondary coil in the direction proper for this result. Transformers\r\nof the straight core type with very soft iron in the cores and not too\r\nhigh rates of alternation should approximate more nearly the\r\ntheoretical relation of primary and secondary waves, because the\r\nmagnetic changes in the core are capable of taking place almost\r\nsimultaneously with the changes of strength of the primary current.\r\nThis fact also has other important practical and theoretical bearings.\r\n\r\nLet us assume a plain iron core, Fig. 7, magnetized as indicated, so\r\nthat its poles, N, S, complete their magnetic circuits by what is\r\ncalled free field or lines in space around it. Let a coil of wire be\r\nwound thereon as indicated. Now assume that the magnetism is to be\r\nlost or cease, either suddenly or slowly. An electric potential will\r\nbe set up in the coil, and if it has a circuit, work or energy will be\r\nproduced or given out in that circuit, and in any other inductively\r\nrelated to it. Hence the magnetic field represents work or potential\r\nenergy. But to develop potential in the wire the lines must cut the\r\nwire. This they can do by collapsing or closing on themselves. The bar\r\nseems, therefore, to lose its magnetism by gaining it all, and in\r\ndoing so all the external lines of force moving inward cut the wire.\r\nThe magnetic circuits shorten and short-circuit themselves in the bar,\r\nperhaps as innumerable molecular magnetic circuits interior to the\r\niron medium. To remagnetize the bar we may pass an electric current\r\nthrough the coil. The small closed circuits are again distended, the\r\nfree field appears, and the lines moving outward cut across the wire\r\ncoil opposite to the former direction and produce a counter potential\r\nin the wire, and consequent absorption of the energy represented in\r\nthe free field produced. As before studied, the magnetism cannot\r\ndisappear without giving out the energy it represents, even though the\r\nwire coil be on open circuit, and therefore unable to discharge that\r\nenergy. The coil open-circuited is static, not dynamic. In such\r\nassumed case the lines in closing cut the core and heat it. Let us,\r\nhowever, laminate the core or subdivide it as far as possible, and we\r\nappear to have cut off this escape for the energy. This is not really\r\nso, however. We have simply increased the possible rate of speed of\r\nclosure, or movement of the lines, and so have increased for the\r\ndivided core the intensity of the actions of magnetic friction and\r\nlocal currents in the core, the latter still receiving the energy of\r\nthe magnetic circuit. This reasoning is based on the possibility in\r\nthis case of cutting off the current in the magnetizing coil and\r\nretaining the magnetic field. This is of itself probably impossible\r\nwith soft iron. That the core receives the energy when the coil cannot\r\nis shown in the well known fact that in some dynamos with armatures of\r\nbobbins on iron cores, the running of the armature coils on open\r\ncircuit gives rise to dangerous heating of the cores, and that under\r\nnormal work the heating is less. In the former case the core\r\naccumulates the energy represented in the magnetic changes. In the\r\nlatter the external circuit of the machine and its wire coils take the\r\nlarger part of the energy which is expended in doing the work in the\r\ncircuit. In this case, also, the current in the coils causes a\r\nretardation of the speed of change and extent of change of magnetism\r\nin the iron cores, which keeps down the intensity of the magnetic\r\nreaction. In fact, this retardation or lag and reduction of range of\r\nmagnetic change may in some machines be made so great by closing the\r\ncircuit of the armature coils themselves or short-circuiting them that\r\nthe total heat developed in the cores is much less than under normal\r\nload.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nI wish now, in closing, to refer briefly to phenomena of moving lines\r\nof force, and to the effects of speed of movement. In order to\r\ngenerate a given potential in a length of conductor we have choice of\r\ncertain conditions. We can vary the strength of field and we can vary\r\nthe velocity. We can use a strong field and slow movement of\r\nconductor, or we can use a weak field and rapid movement of the\r\nconductor. But we find also that where the conductor has large section\r\nit is liable to heat from eddy currents caused by one part of its\r\nsection being in a stronger field than another at the same time. One\r\npart cuts the lines where they are dense and the other where they are\r\nnot dense, with the result of difference of potential and local\r\ncurrents which waste energy in heat. We cannot make the conductor move\r\nin a field of uniform density, because it must pass into and out of\r\nthe field. The conditions just stated are present in dynamos for heavy\r\ncurrent work, where the speed of cutting of lines is low and the\r\narmature conductor large in section.\r\n\r\nBut we find that in a transformer secondary we can use very large\r\nsection of conductor, even (as in welding machines) 12 to 15 square\r\ninches solid copper, without meeting appreciable difficulty from eddy\r\ncurrents in it. The magnetic lines certainly cut the heavy conductor\r\nand generate the heavy current and potential needed. What difference,\r\nif any, exists? In the transformer the currents are generated by\r\nmagnetic field of very low density, in which the lines are moving\r\nacross the conductor with extreme rapidity. The velocity of emanation\r\nof lines around the primary coil is probably near that of light, and\r\neach line passes across the section secondary conductor in a\r\npractically inappreciable time. There is no cause then for differences\r\nof potential at different parts of the section heavy secondary. Then\r\nto avoid eddy currents in large conductors and generate useful\r\ncurrents in them, we may cause the conductor to be either moved into\r\nand out of a low density field with very great speed, or better, we\r\nmust cause the lines of a very low or diffused field to traverse or\r\ncut across the conductor with very high velocity.\r\n\r\nIt is a known fact that, in dynamos with large section armature\r\nconductors, there are less eddy currents produced in the conductors\r\nwhen they are provided with iron cores or wound upon iron cores than\r\nwhen the conductors are made into flat bobbins moved in front of field\r\npoles. Projections existing on the armature between which the\r\nconductors are placed have a like effect, and enable us to employ\r\nheavy bars or bundles of wire without much difficulty from local\r\ncurrents. The reason is simple. In the armatures with coils without\r\niron in them, or without projections extending between the turns, the\r\nconductor moves into and out of a very dense field at comparatively\r\nlow velocity, so that any differences of potential developed in the\r\nparts of the section of conductor have full effect and abundant time\r\nto act in setting up harmful local currents. In the cases in which\r\niron projects through the coil or conductor, the real action is that\r\nthe lines of the magnetic circuits move at high speeds across the\r\nconductor, and the conductor is at all times in a field of very low\r\ndensity. Figs. 8 and 9 will make this plain. In Fig. 8 we have shown a\r\nsmooth armature surface, having a heavy conductor laid thereon, and\r\nwhich is at a just entering a dense field at the edge of the pole,\r\nN, and at b leaving such field. It will be seen that when in such\r\nposition the conductor, if wide, is subjected to varying field\r\nstrength, and moves at a low speed for the generation of the working\r\npotential as it passes through the field, thus giving rise to eddy\r\ncurrents in the conductor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 9 the conductors are set down between projections, in which\r\ncase both armature and field poles are laminated or subdivided. As\r\neach projection leaves the edge of field pole, N, the lines which it\r\nhad concentrated on and through it snap backward at an enormous speed,\r\nand cross the gap to the next succeeding projection on the armature,\r\ncutting the whole section of the heavy armature conductor at\r\npractically the same instant. This brisk transfer of lines goes on\r\nfrom each projection to the succeeding one in front of the field pole,\r\nleaving a very low density of field at any time between the\r\nprojections. The best results would be obtained when the armature\r\nconductor does not project beyond or quite fill the depth of groove\r\nbetween the projections. Of course there are other remedies for the\r\neddy current difficulty, notably the stranding and twisting of the\r\nconductor on the armatures so as to average the position of the parts\r\nof the compound conductor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most extreme case of what may be called dilution of field\r\nby projections and by closed magnetic circuits in transformers would\r\nbe that of a block of iron, B, Fig. 10, moved between poles, N and S,\r\nand having a hole through it, into and through which a conductor is\r\ncarried. The path through the iron is so good that we can scarcely\r\nconsider that any lines cross the hole from N to S; yet as B moves\r\nforward there is a continual snapping transfer of lines from the right\r\nforward side of the hole to the left or backward side, cutting the\r\nconductor as they fly across, and developing an electromotive force in\r\nit. I have described this action more in detail because we have in it\r\nwhatever distinction in the manner of cutting the lines of the field\r\nis to be found between wire on smooth armatures and on projection\r\narmatures and modifications thereof; and also between flat, open coils\r\npassing through a field and bobbins with cores of iron. The\r\nconsiderations advanced also bring out the relation which exists\r\nbetween closed iron circuit transformers and closed iron circuit\r\n(projection) dynamos, as we may call them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\nI had intended at the outset of this paper to deal to some extent with\r\nthe propagation of lines of magnetism undergoing retardation in\r\nreference to alternating current motor devices, transformers with\r\nlimited secondary current, or constant average current, an alternating\r\nmotor working with what I may term a translation lag, etc.; but it was\r\nsoon found that these matters must remain over for a continuation of\r\nthis paper at some future time. My endeavor has been in the present\r\npaper to deal with the lines of force theory as though it were a\r\nsymbol of the reality, but I confess that it is done with many\r\nmisgivings that I may have carried it too far. Yet, if we are to use\r\nthe idea at all it has seemed but right to apply it wherever it may\r\nthrow any light on the subject or assist in our understanding of\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC LIGHTING AT THE PARIS EXHIBITION--THE OERLIKON\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately on entering the Machinery Hall by the _galerie_ leading\r\nfrom the central dome, and occupying a prominent position at the\r\ncommencement of the Swiss section, is a very important plant of\r\ndynamos, motors, and steam engines, put down by the Oerlikon Works, of\r\nZurich. During the time the machinery is kept running in the hall,\r\npower is supplied electrically to drive the whole of the main shafting\r\nin the Swiss section and part of that in the Belgian section,\r\namounting in all to some 200 ft., a large number of machines of\r\nvarious industries deriving their power from these lines of shafting,\r\nwhile during the evening a portion of the upper and lower galleries\r\nadjoining this section is lit by some twenty-five arc lamps run from\r\nthis exhibit. Steam is supplied from the Roser boilers in the motive\r\npower court. The whole of the generating plant is illustrated in one\r\nview, and a separate view is given of the motor employed to drive the\r\nmain shafting, this latter view showing the details of connection to\r\nthe same. On the extreme right hand side of the first view is a direct\r\ncoupled engine and dynamo of 20 horse power, a separate cut of which\r\nis given in Fig. 3. The engine is of the vertical single cylinder\r\ntype, standing 5 ft. high, and fitted, as are the other two engines\r\nexhibited, with centrifugal governor gear on the fly wheel, acting\r\ndirectly on the throw of the cutoff valve eccentric. The two\r\nstandards, supporting the cylinder and forming the guide bars,\r\ntogether with the entire field magnets and pole pieces of the dynamo,\r\nand the bed plate common to both, are cast in one piece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3 ENGINE AND DYNAMO FOR STEAMSHIPS.]\r\n\r\nThe machine is specially designed for ship lighting, and with the view\r\nof preventing any magnetic effect upon the ship's compass, the field\r\nis arranged so that the armature, pole pieces, and coils are entirely\r\ninclosed by iron. Any tendency to leakage of magnetic lines will\r\ntherefore be within the machine, the iron acting as a shield. This\r\nbuild of field--shown in Fig. 3A--is also advantageous as a mechanical\r\nshield to the parts of the machine most likely to suffer from rough\r\nhandling in transport, and it will be seen that the field coils are\r\neasily slipped on before the armature is mounted in its bearings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3A]\r\n\r\nThe winding is compound, and in such a direction that the two opposite\r\nhorizontal poles have the same polarity; it follows from this that\r\nthere will be two consequent poles in the iron, these being opposite\r\nin name to the horizontal poles and at right angles to them, viz.,\r\nabove and below the armature. Opposite sections of the commutator are\r\nconnected together internally as in most four-pole machines, so that\r\nonly two brushes are necessary, at 90 deg. apart.\r\n\r\nThe section of iron in the field is 60 square inches and rectangular\r\nin form, and the whole machine measures 4 ft. 3 in. in length, and 2\r\nft. in height, without including the height of the bed plate. The\r\narmature is 17 in. in length and the same in diameter, measured over\r\nthe winding, and develops at the machine terminals 70 volts and 200\r\namperes at 480 revolutions. The moving parts of the engine are well\r\nbalanced, and run remarkably well and without noise at this high rate\r\nof speed.\r\n\r\nThis dynamo serves to develop power to run a motor in an adjoining\r\ninclosure, containing some fine specimens of lathes and machine tools\r\nconstructed by the Oerlikon Works. These are driven by the motor\r\nthrough the medium of a countershaft, and the power and speed are\r\ncontrolled from the switch board seen at the left of the exhibit, and\r\nin Fig. 11. The resistance, R1, serves to vary the intensity of the\r\nshunt field of the dynamo, the volts being indicated by the voltmeter\r\nV1, and a resistance separate from the switch board is inserted in\r\nthe main circuit of the two machines. The ammeter, A2, is directly\r\nconnected to the dynamo, and therefore indicates the current, whatever\r\ncircuit this machine is running.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 5-9, 11 plus THE PARIS EXHIBITION--STAND OF THE\r\nOERLIKON WORKS.]\r\n\r\nA larger combined engine and dynamo, seen in the center of the stand,\r\nserves to run the lighting of the galleries. The engine is a 60 horse\r\npower compound, running at 350 revolutions, and fitted with a governor\r\non the fly wheel, like that described above.\r\n\r\nThe dynamo is a two-pole machine, the upper pole and yoke being cast\r\nin one, and the lower pole, yoke, and combined bed plate forming a\r\nseparate casting. The two vertical cores, over which the field bobbins\r\nare slipped, are of wrought iron, and are turned with a shoulder at\r\neither end, the yokes being recessed to fit them exactly. The cores\r\nare then bolted to the yokes vertically from the top and horizontally\r\nbelow. The field of this machine is shunt-wound, and in order to\r\nmaintain the potential constant a hand-regulated resistance--R2 on\r\nthe switch board--is added in circuit with the shunt field. The\r\nvoltmeter, V2, immediately above this resistance, serves to\r\nindicate the difference of potential at the machine terminals. Both\r\nvoltmeters are fitted with keys, so that they are only put in circuit\r\nwhen the readings are taken.\r\n\r\nThe main terminals of this machine are fitted on substantial\r\ninsulating bases, fixed one at each end of the top yoke. These connect\r\nto the external circuit by a heavy cable--the machine being capable of\r\ndeveloping 500 amperes--and to the shunt circuit, and regulating\r\nresistance by small wires; while the two connections to the brushes\r\nare by four covered wires in parallel on each side. This mode of\r\nconnection is more flexible than a short length of heavy cable, and\r\nlooks well, the wires being held neatly together by vulcanized fiber\r\nbridges. The dynamo is a low tension machine, the field being\r\nregulated to give 65 volts when running the lamp circuits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe illustration, Fig. 10, represents the automatic\r\nre-regulator--C.E.L. Brown's patent. Motion is imparted to the cores\r\nof two electro-magnets at the ends by the pulleys, W W1. The cores\r\nhave a projection opposite to the spindle, ab, which latter is\r\nscrew-threaded. By a relay one or other electro-magnet is put in\r\naction, and the rotating core, which is magnetized, causes rotation of\r\nthe spindle by attraction, resulting in the movement of the contact\r\nalong the resistance stops. The relay is acted upon directly by the\r\npotential of the dynamo, and the variable resistance is included in\r\nthe shunt field of the machine, so that changes in the potential,\r\nresulting from changes in load or speed, are compensated for.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements of the lamp circuits and the lamp itself may now be\r\ndescribed. The lamps are all run in parallel circuit, but are divided\r\ninto groups of five, each group being controlled by a separate switch\r\non the board--Figs. 11 and 11A. These switches are not in\r\ndirect communication with the dynamo, but make that connection through\r\na large central switch, S2, which therefore carries the whole\r\ncurrent. The returns from each group are brought to the connections\r\nseen between the two resistances, where the circuits may be\r\ndisconnected if desired, and the main current then passes through the\r\nammeter, A3, to the other terminal of the machine. One of the smaller\r\nswitches at the top, Fig. 11A, is directly connected with one terminal\r\nof the 20 horse power dynamo before mentioned, and the other side of\r\nthe switch to the motor in the machine tool exhibit. Also one of the\r\nswitches in connection with the central switch, S2, is connected to\r\nthe same motor, and therefore the latter may be run by either machine,\r\nor, in fact, any combination of machines, lamps, and motor be made as\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe form of switch made by the Oerlikon Works is illustrated in Fig.\r\n7. Two thick semicircular bands of copper are screwed at one end to\r\nopposite sides of a square block which is turned round by the switch\r\nhandle. The block has a projection at each corner, and two strong,\r\nflat, stationary springs are attached to the framework of the switch\r\nand press on opposite sides of the block. The ends of the springs\r\nengage in the projections and prevent the switch being turned round\r\nthe wrong way, while the pressure of the springs on opposite sides\r\nforces the copper bands to take up a position exactly in line with the\r\nterminal contacts when the switch is closed, or at right angles to\r\nthem when it is opened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 4, 4B and 4C]\r\n\r\nFurther, each lamp has its own separate adjustable resistance, fuse,\r\nand switch. These are of special construction, combined in one, and\r\nare illustrated in Figs. 4 and 4A; the other figures, 4B and 4C,\r\nshowing some of the details of the same. The wires, W W, lead from and\r\nto one lamp. The current enters at one wire, passes through the fuse,\r\nf--Figs. 4C and 4A--down the center of the cylinder to a divided\r\ncontact, into which a switch arm can be shot. When this is so, a\r\nconnection is made to the upright brass rod, T, which serves to grip\r\nthe band, R, passing round the body of the cylinder. The current then\r\npasses through all the turns of wire above the band, and out at the\r\nother terminal. The resistance can be varied by raising or lowering\r\nthe band. Fig. 4B shows the manner of tightening the band against the\r\nwires on the cylinder. The upright rod, T, is seen in section, and is\r\nfixed in one position to the frame of the apparatus. Abutting against\r\nthis, and working in the block to which the two ends of the band are\r\nscrewed, is a thumb screw, S, by turning which the band may be\r\nloosened for adjusting, and tightened when the right position is\r\nfound. The cylinder is covered with asbestos sheet, and the wire,\r\nwhich is of nickel, and measures altogether from 3 to 4 ohms, is wound\r\nhelically round this. The switch arm, to which the handle is attached\r\nbelow, does not itself make and break the circuit, but carries a\r\nspring, as shown, which, when the arm is at the end of its movement,\r\npulls over the contact lever with a rapid action, shooting the same\r\nbetween the divided contact piece, and making a perfect contact. The\r\nswitchboard forms one side of a closed wooden case or cupboard, with\r\nsufficient room for a man to enter and adjust the resistances or\r\nswitches for each lamp. These are screwed to the inside of the case in\r\nrows, to the number of twenty-five. The greatest care has been taken\r\nin the fixing of the connections to the inside of this case, and no\r\nleading wires of different potential are allowed to cross each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11A]\r\n\r\nThe Oerlikon lamp, which is designed to work with constant potential,\r\nis shown partly in section in Fig. 8. There is only one solenoid, A,\r\nthrough which all the current passes, and whose action is to strike\r\nthe arc and maintain the current constant. The soft iron core, C, is\r\nsuspended from the inside of the tube, T, in which it has an up and\r\ndown movement checked by an air piston in the tube. An end elevation\r\nof the brake wheels and solenoid is given in Fig. 9, where it will be\r\nseen that the spindle carrying these wheels also carries between them\r\na pinion engaging with the rack rod, R. The top carbon attached to the\r\nrack rod falls by its own weight, and is therefore in contact with the\r\nlower carbon before the lamp is switched in circuit. When this is done\r\nthe core is instantly magnetized, and attracted to the soft iron brake\r\nwheels, which it holds firmly. The air cushion in the tube prevents\r\nthe core being drawn up until it has fairly gripped the sides of the\r\nwheels. The subsequent raising of the core therefore turns the wheels,\r\nraises the rack rod, and strikes the arc. The feed is operated by the\r\nweakening of the magnetic field of the coil, which causes the core to\r\nlose its grip of the wheels, and allows the top carbon to descend. The\r\ncatch, L, Fig. 8, has a lateral play, and serves to engage in the\r\nteeth of the rack rod, so as to prevent its falling when being\r\ntrimmed. Each carbon when in position is held against two rectangular\r\nguide bars by the pressure of a wire spring--see figure. In this way\r\nthe carbon is pressed against two parallel knife edges, and is\r\ntherefore always in true alignment. The action of the lamp is very\r\nsimple, the working parts are few and solidly constructed, and the\r\nregulation, as exhibited by the lamps running in the galleries, is\r\nexceptionally steady.\r\n\r\nThe transmission of power plant consists of two 250 horse power\r\ndynamos--C.E.L. Brown's patent--the generator being driven by a\r\nvertical compound condensing engine of the same power, running at 180\r\nrevolutions. The dynamo generator is a four-pole 600 volt direct\r\ncurrent machine, series wound, and may be distinguished in the\r\nengraving next to the switch board; while the motor receiver\r\nconnected to it, and erected in another portion of the Swiss section,\r\nis of exactly the same size and type. The field, which is hexagonal in\r\nshape, is cast in two pieces, bolted together horizontally, the\r\ncross-sectional area of iron being 170 square inches. The armature is\r\ncylindrical, and built up of flat rings stamped out of soft sheet\r\niron, eight notches in the same being provided to fit over the arms of\r\nthe spider keyed to the shaft. The spider is in halves, which are\r\nbolted together longitudinally after the rings are in position. It is\r\nGramme wound, and measures over the winding 7 in. radial depth, 37 in.\r\noutside diameter, and 22 in. in length. The current is collected by\r\nfour brushes. The fitting and mechanical build of the dynamos leaves\r\nnothing to be desired. All the working parts of the dynamos and\r\nengines are turned up to gauge and template, so as to be\r\ninterchangeable. As an instance of this, the armature of the generator\r\nwas built in the works, while the field magnets were being erected in\r\nthe exhibition, and, on arrival, fitted in position perfectly, and ran\r\nat once without trouble.\r\n\r\nThe energy taken off on the motor shaft is close on 200 horse power,\r\nbut varies according to the machines at work; the speed of the motor\r\ndoes not, however, vary more than 3 per cent., and the brushes need no\r\nadjustment. About 6 ft. of shafting is coupled on in line with the\r\nmotor shaft, and an extra plummer block fixed at the end. This\r\nshafting carries at its extremity an additional 2 ft. pulley, the\r\npower being delivered by belting from these pulleys to two large\r\npulleys on the main shaft.\r\n\r\nThe machines run by this transmission consist of the looms of Rieter &\r\nCo., of Winterthur; the large flour mill and lift of A. Millot & Co.;\r\nthe flour milling machinery of Frederick Wegmann & Co., of Zurich; the\r\nbrick and tile making machines of the Rorschach foundries; and the\r\nlooms of Messrs. Houget & Teston, of Verviers, in the Belgian section.\r\nA 15 horse power two-pole Oerlikon dynamo is also run by a belt from\r\nthe main shaft, and generates power to drive a motor of similar type\r\nin the Swiss section of the upper gallery. This runs a length of\r\ncountershafting supplying power to three silk-weaving machines\r\nconstructed by Benninger Frères; six weaving machines from the Ruti\r\nworks, near Zurich; and one knitting machine exhibited by Edward\r\nDubied & Co., of Couvet.\r\n\r\nThe dynamo and motor are connected to the main cable by switches of\r\nthe type shown in Fig. 5. These are specially designed to destroy the\r\nextra current on breaking circuit by the formation of an arc which\r\ngradually increases the resistance till the break occurs, rendering it\r\nless sudden. One wire passes through the handle and makes contact with\r\nthe springs, and the other is attached to the clamp in which the\r\ncarbon rod is held. The current is made to enter at the carbon rod, so\r\nthat the arcs formed cause consumption of the carbon. A magnetic\r\ncut-out--Fig. 6--is also provided to each machine; this consists of an\r\nelectro-magnet, through which the main current passes, provided with\r\nside pole pieces. A flat soft iron plate armature is hinged so as to\r\ncome up against the pole pieces when attracted. When the current is\r\nnot sufficiently strong to cause the plate to be attracted, a hole in\r\nthe center of the latter engages over a small projection in the top of\r\na weighted arm hinged in the center of the board, and keeps it\r\nupright. If now the current exceeds the limits of safety to the\r\nmachine, due to a too heavy load being thrown on, the armature is\r\nattracted and releases the vertical arm, which falls over and enters\r\nwith considerable force between the two spring contacts below. These\r\ncontacts are connected to the field terminals, which are, therefore,\r\nshort-circuited, and prevent the dynamo generating any current. A\r\nretractile spring can be adjusted to cause cut-off at any required\r\ncurrent. These details are indicated in our illustrations mounted on\r\ntheir respective switch boards.\r\n\r\nSince the erection of plant by these works at Solothurn for\r\ntransmitting 50 horse power five miles distant, which attracted so\r\nmuch interest some time ago, several important works have been carried\r\nout. Among these we may mention a 280 horse power transmission at 1½\r\nkilom. distance to a cotton mill at Derendingen in Switzerland, a 250\r\nhorse power transmission at ½ kilom. distance, carried out for Gaetano\r\nRossi at Piovene in Italy, and a 300 horse transmission at 6 kilom.\r\ndistance installed for Giovanni Rossi, in which the power is given off\r\nat two different stations.--_The Engineer._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADER FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough telephonic novelties are not numerous at the Universal\r\nExposition, telephony--that quite young branch of electric science--is\r\ndaily the object of curious and interesting experiments which we must\r\nmake known to our readers, a large number of whom were not yet born to\r\nscientific life when the experiments were made for the first time at\r\nParis in 1881; and it is proper to congratulate the Société Générale\r\ndes Téléphones on having repeated them in 1889 to the great\r\nsatisfaction of the rising generation.\r\n\r\nWe allude to the Ader system of telephonic transmissions of sounds in\r\nsuch a way that they can be heard by an audience.\r\n\r\nThe essential parts of this mode of transmission consist of two\r\ndistinct systems--transmitters and receivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--THE ADER FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS]\r\n\r\nThe transmitters are four in number, and are actuated by the same\r\nnumber of musicians, each humming into them his part of the quartet\r\n(Fig. 1). This transmitter, represented apart in elevation and section\r\nin Fig. 2, is identical with the one used in the curious experiment\r\nwith the singing condenser. At A is a mouthpiece before which the\r\nmusician hums his part as upon a reed pipe. He causes the plate, B, to\r\nvibrate in unison with the sound that he emits, and this produces\r\nperiodical interruptions of varying rapidity between the disk, B, and\r\nthe point, C. The button, D, serves to regulate the distance in such a\r\nway that the breakings of the circuit shall be very complete and\r\nproduce sounds in the receivers as pure as allowed by this special\r\nmode of transmission, in which all the harmonics are systematically\r\nsuppressed in order to re-enforce the fundamental.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--DETAILS OF THE TRANSMITTER.]\r\n\r\nThis transmitter interrupter is interposed in the circuit of a battery\r\nof accumulators, with the five receivers that it actuates, in such a\r\nway that the four transmitters and five receivers form in reality four\r\ngroups of distinct autonomous transmission, the accordance of which is\r\nabsolutely dependent upon that of the artists who make them vibrate.\r\n\r\nThe five receivers are arranged over the front door of the telephone\r\npavilion, near the Eiffel tower (Fig. 3). Each consists of a horseshoe\r\nmagnet provided, between its branches, with two small iron cores\r\nhaving a space of a few millimeters between them (Fig. 4). Each of\r\nthese soft iron cores carries a copper wire bobbin, N, the number of\r\nspirals of which is properly calculated for the effect to be produced.\r\nOpposite the vacant space left by the two cores, there is a small\r\npiece, t, of rectangular form, and also of soft iron, fixed to a\r\nvibrating strip of firwood, L, of about 4 inches section. The\r\nperiodical breaking of the circuit produced by the transmitter causes\r\na variation in the magnetization of the iron cores of the five\r\nreceivers and makes the firwood strips vibrate energetically. These\r\nvibrations are received and poured forth as it were in front of the\r\ntelephone pavilion, by large brass trumpets arranged in front of each\r\nreceiver, as shown in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--THE ADER FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS]\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult for us to pass any judgment whatever upon the\r\nmusical and artistic value of these transmissions of trumpet music to\r\na distance; we prefer to confess our incompetency in the matter. But\r\nit is none the less certain that these experiments are having the same\r\nsuccess that they had at their inception in 1881 at the Universal\r\nExposition of Electricity, and they allow us to foresee that there is\r\na time coming in which it will be possible to transmit speech to a\r\ndistance with the same intensity that the present trumpet flourishes\r\nhave. Although all the tentatives hitherto made in this direction have\r\nnot given very brilliant results, we must not despair of attaining the\r\nend some day or other. Less than fifteen years ago the telephone did\r\nnot exist; now it covers the world with its lines.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--DETAILS OF THE RECEIVER.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON DYEWOOD EXTRACTS AND SIMILAR PREPARATIONS.\r\n\r\nBy LOUIS SIEBOLD, F.I.C., F.C.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last ten years there has been an enormous increase in the\r\nproduction of these preparations, and the time will come when their\r\napplication in dyeing and calico printing will become so general as to\r\ncompletely supersede the employment of the raw materials. The\r\nmanufacture of these extracts, to be thoroughly successful, requires\r\nto be so conducted as to secure the perfect exhaustion of the dyewoods\r\nwithout the slightest destruction or deterioration of the coloring\r\nmatters contained in them; and though nothing like perfection has been\r\nreached in the attainment of these objects, it is certain that the\r\nprocesses of extraction and evaporation now employed by the best\r\nmakers are a very great improvement on the older methods. Indeed,\r\nthere is no difficulty nowadays in procuring dyewood extracts of high\r\nexcellence if the consumer is willing to pay a price for them\r\ncorresponding to their quality, and knows how to avail himself of the\r\naid of chemical skill to control his purchases. Unfortunately,\r\nhowever, there is so much hankering after cheap articles, and so\r\nlittle care is taken to ascertain their real quality, that every scope\r\nis afforded to the malpractices of the adulterer. There are many dye\r\nand print works in which large quantities of these extracts are used\r\nwithout being subjected to trustworthy tests. Moreover, much of the\r\ntesting is done by fallacious methods and often by biased hands. So\r\nfallacious, indeed, are some of these tests, that grossly adulterated\r\nextracts are often declared superior to the purer ones, the cause of\r\nthis being the application of an insufficient proportion of mordant in\r\nthe dyeing or printing trials, and the consequent waste of the excess\r\nof coloring matter in the case of the purer preparation.\r\n\r\nProfessional analytical chemists have hitherto given but little\r\nattention to these preparations, and the employment of experienced\r\nchemists in works is as yet far from general. The testing of dyewood\r\nextracts in such a manner as to throw full light on their purity, the\r\nquality of raw material from which they are prepared, their exact\r\ncommercial value their suitability for special purposes, and the\r\nproportion and nature of any adulterants they may contain, is of\r\ncourse a difficult and tedious task, and must be left to the expert\r\nwho is in possession of authentic specimens prepared by himself of all\r\nthe different extracts made from every variety and quality of raw\r\nmaterials, and who combines a thorough knowledge of experimental\r\ndyeing and printing with a large experience in the chemical\r\ninvestigation of these preparations. But when the object of the\r\ntesting is merely careful comparison of the sample in question with an\r\noriginal sample or previous deliveries, the case is much simplified,\r\nand comes within the scope of the general chemist or the laboratory\r\nattached to works. A few years ago I recommended carefully conducted\r\ndyeing trials on woolen cloth mordanted with bichromate of potash as\r\nthe best and simplest mode adapted to such cases, and my subsequent\r\nexperience enables me to confirm that observation to the fullest\r\nextent. Most of these extracts contain the coloring matter in two\r\nstates, the developed and the undeveloped, and an oxidizing mordant\r\nsuch as bichromate of potash causes the latter as well as the former\r\nto enter completely into combination with a metallic base; whereas\r\nmany of the other mordants, such as alumina or tin compounds, merely\r\ntake up the developed portion of the coloring matter together with\r\nsuch small and variable proportions of the undeveloped as might\r\nundergo oxidation during the process of dyeing. I would therefore\r\nsuggest dyeing trials with alumina, tin, iron, etc., only as\r\nsubsidiary tests indicating the suitability of an extract for certain\r\nspecial purposes, while recommending the trial with bichromate of\r\npotash as the one giving the best information respecting the actual\r\nstrength of the extract in relation to the raw material from which it\r\nwas obtained, and as giving a fair idea of the money value of the\r\nsample. Cotton dyeing does not, as a general rule, afford a good means\r\nof assaying extracts, as it is generally done under conditions which\r\ndo not admit of complete exhaustion of the dye bath, but it might\r\noften with advantage be resorted to as an additional trial throwing\r\nfurther light on the degree of oxidation or development of the\r\ncoloring matter. Printing trials are apt to give fallacious results\r\nunless the proportion of mordant is carefully adjusted to the amount\r\nof coloring matter present, and several trials with different\r\nproportions would be necessary to prevent erroneous conclusions. For\r\nthe trials with bichromate of potash on wool I would recommend pieces\r\nof cloth weighing about 150 grains, and the most suitable proportion\r\nof bichromate of potash is 3 per cent. of the weight of the cloth. The\r\nrequisite number of pieces (equal to the number of samples to be\r\ntested) should be thoroughly scoured and then heated in the bichromate\r\nsolution at or near the boiling point for not less than 1½ hours,\r\nafter which they should be well washed and then dyed separately in the\r\nsolutions of equal weights of the extracts at the same temperature and\r\nfor the same length of time; 15 grains of extract is a suitable\r\nquantity for a first trial under these conditions. These trials can\r\nthen be repeated with different relative proportions of extract in\r\norder to ascertain what weight of a sample would give the same depth\r\nof color as 15 grains of the standard example. Many precautions are\r\nrequired both in the mordanting and dyeing processes in order to\r\nobtain trustworthy results; and though the trials with bichromate of\r\npotash give the most reliable information of any single test, they\r\nshould be supplemented by the subsidiary tests already alluded to, and\r\nalso by a chemical examination, in order to obtain a knowledge, not\r\nmerely of the wood strength, but also of the general nature of the\r\nextract. An adulteration with molasses or glucose can be best\r\ndetermined by fermentation in comparison with a pure sample. Mineral\r\nadulterants may, of course, be detected by an estimation and analysis\r\nof the ash, after making due allowances for variations due to\r\ndifferences in different kinds of the same dyewoods. The estimation of\r\nthe individual coloring matters in these extracts by means of a\r\nchemical analysis is under all circumstances a task requiring much\r\nexperience, especially as the coloring principles are associated in\r\ndifferent qualities of each class of dyewood with different\r\nproportions of other constituents which often give much trouble to the\r\nunpracticed experimenter. Extracts made from logwood roots are now\r\nlargely manufactured and often substituted or mixed with the extracts\r\nof real logwood, and have in some instances been palmed of as logwood\r\nextracts of high quality. The correct determination of such\r\nadmixtures, like the fixing of anything like the exact commercial\r\nvalue of dyewood extracts, requires nothing less than a complete\r\nchemical investigation coupled with numerous dyeing trials in\r\ncomparison with standard preparations, and should be left to an\r\nexpert.\r\n\r\nThe presence in dyewood extracts of coloring matters in various stages\r\nof development has hitherto militated against their use in place of\r\nthe raw materials by many dyers and printers who are still employing\r\ninherited and antiquated processes in which the whole of the coloring\r\nmatter is not rendered available. It is often asserted by these that\r\neven the best of extracts fail to give anything like the results\r\nattained by the use of well-prepared woods, and that, indeed, their\r\napplication proves a complete failure. Such failure, however, is\r\nsimply due to the want of chemical knowledge on the part of the dyers,\r\nfor there is no real difficulty in making any good and pure extract\r\nserve all the purposes for which the woods were used. It is to be\r\nhoped that in this branch of industry, as well as in many others, the\r\nemployment of chemists will become more general than at present, and\r\nnot be restricted, as is often the case, to young men without\r\nexperience and without the trained intellect so essential to success\r\nin chemical investigations. High class chemical skill is of course\r\navailable to the manufacturer, but the man of science who brings\r\nmatured knowledge and valuable brain work into the business required\r\nsocial as well as pecuniary recognition, and the sooner and more\r\nfuller this fact is appreciated the better it will be for the\r\nmaintenance and progress of our industries.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the astringent extracts, such as sumac, myrabolam,\r\ndivi, valonia, quebracho, oak, etc., it is the aim of the\r\nmanufacturer, whenever such extracts are intended for the purposes of\r\ndyeing and printing, to obtain the tannin in a form in which it is\r\nbest calculated to fix itself upon the fiber. The case is somewhat\r\ndifferent when the same extracts are required for tanning. For this\r\npurpose it is necessary that the extract shall have considerable\r\npermeating power, and that the tannin contained in it shall readily\r\nyield leather of the desired texture, color, and permanency. Extracts\r\nspecially suited for this purpose are by no means always the most\r\nsuitable for the dyer, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nA brief description of the processes by which the astringent extracts\r\nmay be tested with particular reference to their fitness for definite\r\npurposes concluded the paper.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the question as to whether experimental dyeing with\r\nbichromate of potash should be employed as a test even in works where\r\nall the dyeing was done with other mordants, he was decidedly of\r\nopinion that it should always be resorted to as one of the tests,\r\ninasmuch as it was the only simple and expeditious method giving a\r\nfair idea of the actual wood strength and money value of the extract.\r\nThe test should, in such cases, be supplemented by dyeing trials with\r\nthe mordants used at the works, and, if necessary, also by a chemical\r\nanalysis. Printing trials were not necessarily bad tests, since\r\noxidizing was usually added in these where it was necessary, and any\r\nundeveloped coloring matter would thus be oxidized during the steaming\r\nprocess: but, as he had stated before, it was essentially necessary in\r\nsuch cases to have a fair idea of the amount of actual coloring matter\r\nin the extract and to adjust the proportion of mordant accordingly.\r\nSuch trials should therefore be preceded by carefully conducted dyeing\r\ntrials with bichromate of potash. Mr. Thomson had raised the question\r\nwhether it would not be well for the manufacturer to prepare these\r\nextracts in such a manner that they would contain all the coloring\r\nmatter in one condition only, in order to insure greater uniformity in\r\ntheir quality and mode of application. This would, no doubt, be a\r\ndesirable step to take if the owners of dye and print works were more\r\nin the habit of availing themselves of the service of competent\r\nchemists experienced in this branch, for then they would be able to\r\nmake any extract do its full work irrespective of the state of\r\ndevelopment of the coloring matter. Such, however, was not the case,\r\nand it was a very common thing for the consumer of dyewood extracts to\r\nrequire the manufacturer to prepare them specially for him so as to\r\nsuit his own dyeing recipes, or in other words to give exactly the\r\nsame shades, weight for weight, by his own method of dyeing as the\r\narticle he was in the habit of using. The manufacturer was thus often\r\ncompelled to make many different qualities of the same extract to suit\r\ndifferent customers. For the same reason adulterated articles were\r\noften preferred to the pure ones. There was, perhaps, no branch of\r\nindustry in which chemical skill of a high order could be applied with\r\ngreater advantage than in dyeing, and nowhere was this fact less\r\nrecognized. Some of the processes of dyeing were exceedingly wasteful\r\nand stood in much need of improvement. He (Mr. Siebold) knew a large\r\nworks in which a ton of logwood extract was used daily for black\r\ndyeing only, and he might safely assert that of this enormous quantity\r\nonly a very small proportion would be fixed on the fiber, while by far\r\nthe greater proportion was utterly wasted. Such a waste could only be\r\nprevented by a searching investigation of its causes by trained skill.\r\nMr. Thomson had further alluded to the color obtained with logwood or\r\nlogwood extract and wool mordanted with bichromate of potash, and\r\nseemed to be under the impression that the color thus obtained was not\r\nblack, but blue. This was undoubtedly the case in dyeing trials\r\nperformed as tests, as these were conducted purposely with a very\r\nsmall proportion of coloring matter in order to admit of a better\r\ncomparison of the resulting depth of shades. But with larger\r\nproportions of logwood the color obtained was a fine bluish-black, and\r\nwith the addition of a small proportion of fustic or quercitron bark\r\nto the logwood a jet black was readily produced. With regard to Mr.\r\nWatson Smith's observation as to fractional dyeing, he (Mr. Siebold)\r\ndid not regard this method as a suitable trial for ascertaining the\r\nstrength of an extract, but he admitted it was occasionally very\r\nvaluable for detecting an admixture of extracts of other dyewoods,\r\nsuch as quercitron bark extract in logwood extract. It was also a good\r\nmethod of ascertaining the speed of dyeing and hence the relative\r\nproportion of fully developed coloring matter of an extract.--_Jour.\r\nSoc. Chem.

LITZKOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I want to show is the manner in which the process has been\r\ntested. My employer, Mr. Bierstadt, has given me permission to show\r\nyou some samples, and also his chart containing the spectrum colors:\r\nviolet, indigo blue, green, yellow, orange, red, and black. This chart\r\nhas been photographed in the orthochromatic and also in the ordinary\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of producing an orthochromatic effect; one is the\r\nuse of a glass tank placed behind or in front of the lens, in which a\r\ncoloring matter from either a vegetable or mineral product is placed;\r\nthis tank or cell is, however, only for use in the studio, as for\r\noutdoor photography we have a colored glass screen, so as not to be\r\nbothered with carrying colored solution.\r\n\r\nThe tank is constructed as follows: Procure two pieces of best white\r\nplate glass, about 6 inches square; between these place a piece of\r\nrubber of the same size square, and about 3/8 of an inch thick. In the\r\ncenter of this rubber cut out a circle about 4 inches diameter, and\r\nfrom one of the corners to the center of the circle cut out a narrow\r\nstrip ¼ inch wide; this serves as the mouth of the tank. The two\r\npieces of glass and the rubber are cemented together with rubber\r\ncement; then, to hold it firmly together, two brass flanges are used\r\nas a clamp, with four screws at an equal distance apart; a thin sheet\r\nof rubber is on the glass side of the flanges to prevent direct\r\ncontact with the glass, the center remaining clear for the rays of\r\nlight to pass through solution and glass.\r\n\r\nOne of the best orthochromatic effects made through this tank is with\r\na three-grains-to-the-ounce solution of bichromatic of ammonia or\r\nbichromate of potassium. In this method there is no preparation used\r\non the plate. A common rapid dry plate is exposed through this\r\nsolution; the exposure, however, is about twenty times longer than it\r\nwould be if you removed the tank with the yellow solution, or, in\r\nother words, if a dry-plate is exposed one minute without the yellow\r\nsolution it would have to be exposed twenty minutes through a\r\nthree-grain solution of bichromate of potassium or ammonia. It\r\nproduces wonderful results on an oil painting or any highly colored\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nAnother method, and the one best adapted for landscapes, is to bathe\r\nthe plate in erythrosine and then expose it through a yellow glass\r\nscreen.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration, suppose we have before us a beautiful landscape.\r\nIn the foreground beautiful foliage, in the center a lake, in the\r\ndistance hills, with a bluish haze appearing pleasing to the eye, also\r\na nice sky with light clouds. Now make a plain negative, and see what\r\nhas become of your clouds, hills, and the distance--not visible! Some\r\nphotographers have been led to think that by underexposing they retain\r\nthe distance, but they sacrifice the foreground; besides, it does not\r\nproduce an orthochromatic effect.\r\n\r\nBut it is a good idea to expose longer on the foreground than you do\r\non the distance. This can be done by raising the cap of the lens\r\nskyward and gradually shut off, giving the foreground more exposure.\r\n\r\nPlates are prepared for orthochromatic work as follows: Take any\r\nordinary rapid dry plate, place it in a bath containing\r\n\r\n  Distilled water                    200 c.c.\r\n  Strong liquid ammonia                2 c.c.\r\n\r\nRock it for two minutes, work as dark as you possibly can. Now take it\r\nout, and place it in the second bath for one and one-fourth minutes\r\nand keep it rocking. Have on hand for use a stock solution of\r\n\r\n  Distilled water                       1,000 parts.\r\n  Erythrosine \"Y\" brand                     1 part.\r\n\r\nPrepare second bath as follows:\r\n\r\n  Erythrosine stock solution               25 c.c.\r\n  Distilled water                         175 c.c.\r\n  Strong water ammonia                      4 c.c.\r\n\r\nAfter removing the plate, dip it again face down to rinse off any\r\nparticles of scum, etc., that may get in the bath accidentally. This\r\nbath may be used for one dozen 8 by 10, when it should be thrown away\r\nand fresh bath used.\r\n\r\nAfter the plates come out of the last bath, they should be stood on\r\nclean blotting paper to absorb the excess of solution. I would also\r\nadvise to use clean fingers. Pyro. or hypo. on the fingers is a\r\ndrawback to success.\r\n\r\nAfter plates have been drained, place them in a cleaned rack in an\r\nabsolutely light-tight closet, with air holes so constructed as to\r\nadmit air but no light; the plates will dry in from eight to twelve\r\nhours. They are best prepared in the evening, and, if the closet is\r\ngood, will be dry in the morning.\r\n\r\nAfter the plates are dry they may be packed face to face with nothing\r\nbetween them, in a double-cover paper box, and put in a dark closet\r\nfree from sulphureted hydrogen gas, until ready for use. I have kept\r\nplates for three months in this way, and they were in good condition.\r\nGreat care should be used in developing these plates, as they are\r\nsensitive to the red; get used to developing in a dark part of the\r\ndark room; occasionally you may look at the process of development in\r\na little stronger light.\r\n\r\nThe exposure through the yellow screen with an erythrosine plate is\r\nabout the same as if you had no orthochromatic plate--a plain plate\r\ninstead--provided you are not using too dark a yellow on your screen.\r\nThis can only be determined by experience. I will give to a common\r\nplate about four seconds, an orthochromatic plate under the same\r\nconditions five seconds.\r\n\r\nThe yellow glass screen is prepared as follows: Take a piece of best\r\nplate glass--common cannot be used--clean it nicely; take another\r\nlarge plate glass, or anything that is level and true, level it with a\r\nsmall spirit-level. Now take the cleaned piece of glass and coat it\r\nwith\r\n\r\nAURENTIA COLLODION.\r\n\r\n  Ether                                  5 oz.\r\n  Alcohol                                5 oz.\r\n  Cotton                                60 grs.\r\n\r\nThe aurentia to be added to suit your judgment; it takes a very small\r\nquantity to make an intense yellowish-red collodion. Pour it on the\r\ncenter of the glass, flow it to the edges, and before it sets place it\r\non the level glass and allow it to set; when set put it in a rack to\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nShould it dry in ridges, the collodion may be too thick, and it must\r\nbe thinned down with equal parts of alcohol and ether. A single piece\r\nof plate glass, about one-eighth inch thick, coated with aurentia\r\ncollodion, is all that is required with an erythrosine plate. Or,\r\nafter a piece has been successfully coated, another piece of the same\r\nplate glass, and the same size, may be cemented together with balsam,\r\nhaving the coated aurentia side between the two glasses; the edges may\r\nthen be bound with paper.\r\n\r\nIn using different colored solutions, collodion, etc., I have found\r\nthat one will change the focus and the other not. With some screens\r\nyou must focus with them in their positions; take away the screen, and\r\nthe picture appears out of focus. I cannot fully explain why it is,\r\nand for this reason will not make the attempt; experience alone can\r\nteach it.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that has been tried lately is to do away with the yellow\r\nscreen by substituting a yellow coating direct on the plate. No doubt\r\nthe focus on an object that requires absolute sharpness is somewhat\r\naffected by the use of a glass. We have been successful, on a small\r\nscale, to coat the plate with the following yellow solution:\r\n\r\nPlace in a tray enough of a saturated solution of tropæolin in wood\r\nalcohol to cover the plate; allow it to remain ten seconds. It is\r\nnecessary that the plate should be bathed previously in erythrosine\r\nand dried. Before applying the tropæolin, which, being in alcohol,\r\ndries in a few minutes, have some blotting paper on hand, as the\r\nsolution gathers in a pool and leaves bad marks on the end of the\r\nplate.\r\n\r\nThe plate can be developed in the usual way. Try it and see the\r\nresults.--_Reported in the Beacon._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATINOTYPE PRINTING.[1]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: A communication to the North London Photographic\r\n   Society.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPlatinotype, which may be considered to be the most artistic of\r\nphotographic printing processes, may be separated into its three\r\nmodifications--the hot bath and cold bath, in which a faintly visible\r\nimage is developed, and the Pizzighelli printing-out paper. The hot\r\nbath process, again, may be divided into the black and white and sepia\r\npapers. I intend to give you a rough outline of the preparation of the\r\npaper and working of these modifications, concluding by demonstrating\r\nthe hot bath method, and handing around prints by it.\r\n\r\nPlatinotype may almost be styled an iron printing process, for, while\r\nno trace of iron or its salts is found in the finished print, certain\r\nsalts of iron are mixed with the platinum salt, which is platinum\r\ncombined with two atoms of chlorine (PtCl2), as a means for readily\r\nreducing it; this, however, cannot be effected without the presence of\r\nneutral oxalate of potash, hence the use of the oxalate bath. There is\r\nno platinum in the paper for the cold bath process, it being coated\r\nwith ferric oxalate mixed with a very small quantity of chloride of\r\nmercury--somewhere about one grain to an ounce of ferric oxalate\r\nsolution. When dry it is ready for exposure, which is about three\r\ntimes less than with silver printing.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely necessary to store all papers for platinum printing\r\nin an air-tight tin containing chloride of calcium, which must be\r\ndried by heating from time to time. For the cold bath, however, it is\r\nimportant to have moisture present during printing, or it may be after\r\nprinting and before development. If the paper is left in a dampish\r\nroom for fifteen minutes, it should be sufficient. Prints made by\r\nexposing damp paper, or damping dry paper just before development,\r\nmust be developed within one hour if the maximum of vigor is desired;\r\nby delaying the development some hours, the prints in the meantime\r\nbeing stored in a drawer so that they may retain their moisture, an\r\nincrease of half tone and warmth of color will be obtained. If it\r\nshould be necessary to delay development for a day or two, the prints\r\nmust be dried before a fire soon after being removed from the frames,\r\nand then stored in a calcium tube until wanted for development.\r\n\r\nWhile printing, the lemon color of the paper receives a grayish\r\ncolored image, which, although faint, can, with practice, be judged as\r\neasily as silver printing.\r\n\r\nThe developer consists of oxalate of potash and potassic\r\nchloro-platinite--about thirty grains of the platinum salt to half an\r\nounce of oxalate forming about six ounces of solution; a great many\r\nvariations, however, may be made in the proportions of platinum salt\r\nand oxalate, and different effects secured. Development is effected by\r\nsliding the print face downward on to the developer, which must be\r\nrocked after the development of each print to avoid scum marks. To\r\nclear the prints they are washed in three or four baths of a weak\r\nsolution of hydrochloric acid after leaving the developer, to remove\r\nall traces of the iron salts, and finally washed for a quarter of an\r\nhour in three changes of water; they are then finished, and may be\r\ndried between clean blotting paper.\r\n\r\nPizzighelli's process differs from the above in being one that prints\r\nfully out in the frame without development; the paper contains the\r\nplatinum and iron salts as well as the developer, and so prints and\r\ndevelops at the same time. Although excellent prints can be produced\r\nwith it, for general work the results of the paper, as at present\r\nmade, will not compare with the hot and cold bath processes. It is,\r\nhowever, excellent for printing from very dense negatives, and\r\noccasional negatives that seem extremely suitable for it. The paper\r\nshould be breathed on before printing, as if it is quite dry the\r\nprinting will be very slow and irregular. The best conditions for the\r\npreparation of the paper have scarcely been decided upon yet, and it\r\nis not quite fair to judge the process. The prints are cleared in the\r\nacid baths and washed for about a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nThe sepia and black hot bath processes are much alike in the general\r\ntreatment. There are, however, some special precautions to be observed\r\nwith the sepia paper, the chief being to protect it from any but the\r\nfaintest rays of light; the prints, unlike the black ones, may be\r\naffected by light when in the acid bath. A special solution must be\r\nadded to the developer to keep the lights pure. Over-exposure cannot\r\nbe corrected by using a cooler bath, as is the case with the black\r\nprints, and the paper does not remain good so long.\r\n\r\nThe paper for the black prints by the hot bath process is washed with\r\na mixture of potassic platinous chloride and ferric oxalate, the\r\nproportion being about sixty grains of the platinum salt to one ounce\r\nof the iron solution. It will not keep good longer than twenty minutes\r\nor so, and must be applied to the paper directly after mixing. The\r\nferric oxalate in the paper is reduced by the action of light to\r\nferrous oxalate, which forms the faint visible image; this, when the\r\npaper is floated on the oxalate of potash bath, is capable of reducing\r\nthe platinum salt in contact with it into metallic platinum; but the\r\nferric salt, which remains unaltered, has no action on the platinum\r\nsalt, leaving these parts, which represent the high lights of the\r\nprint, untouched. The ferric oxalate is removed by the acid baths\r\nwhich follow the development. A good temperature for development is\r\n150° Fahr., and when using this so much detail should not be apparent\r\nas when printing for the cold bath process, in which all the detail\r\ndesired should be very faintly visible. There are, however, many\r\nmethods of exposing the paper and developing it, and no fixed rule can\r\nbe made, but the development must in every case be suited to the\r\nexposure or the result will be a failure. For instance, the paper may\r\nbe printed until all detail is visible, but a very much cooler\r\ndevelopment must be used, say 80° or 90°; on the other hand, a\r\nslightly short exposure may be given, and a temperature of 180° to\r\n200° used. 150° should be taken as the normal temperature, and kept to\r\nuntil some experience has been gained, as employing all temperatures\r\nwill lead to confusion, and nothing will be learned. Some negatives\r\nrequire a special treatment, and both printing and development must be\r\naltered, while for a very dense negative the paper may be left out in\r\na dampish room for some time. It will then print with less contrast\r\nand more half tone. A thin negative is better printed by the cold bath\r\nprocess, but negatives should be good and brilliant for platinotype\r\nprinting. Any one taking up platinotype and getting only weak prints\r\nwould do well to look to his negatives instead of blaming the paper,\r\nas the high lights should be fairly dense, and the deep shadows nearly\r\nclear glass.\r\n\r\nTime for complete development should always be allowed; with a hot\r\nbath fifteen seconds will be sufficient, but if a cooler development\r\nis used, or the prints are solarized in the shadows, more time should\r\nbe allowed. When the deep shadows are solarized, or appear lighter\r\nthan surrounding parts, a hot and prolonged development is required to\r\nobtain sufficient blackness, as they have a tendency to look like\r\nbrown paper. I have found breathing on solarized shadows useful, as in\r\nthe presence of slight moisture they begin to print out and become\r\ndark before development, getting black almost directly the print is\r\nfloated on the oxalate. Three or four acid baths of about ten minutes\r\neach are used, and the prints are washed as before. The process\r\nthroughout takes much less time than silver printing, and can be kept\r\non all the winter, when it is nearly impossible to print in silver.\r\nPrints can be developed in weak daylight or gaslight, and prolonged\r\nwashing is dispensed with.--_N.P.

CAREY LEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first part of this paper were described certain forms of\r\nsilver; among them a lilac blue substance, very soluble in water, with\r\na deep red color. After undergoing purification, it was shown to be\r\nnearly pure silver. During the purification by washing it seemed to\r\nchange somewhat, and, consequently, some uncertainty existed as to\r\nwhether or not the purified substance was essentially the same as the\r\nfirst product; it seemed possible that the extreme solubility of the\r\nproduct in its first condition might be due to a combination in some\r\nway with citric acid, the acid separating during the washing. Many\r\nattempts were made to get a decisive indication, and two series of\r\nanalyses, one a long one, to determine the ratio between the silver\r\nand the citric acid present, without obtaining a wholly satisfactory\r\nresult, inasmuch as even these determinations of mere ratio involved a\r\ncertain degree of previous purification which might have caused a\r\nseparation.\r\n\r\nThis question has since been settled in an extremely simple way, and\r\nthe fact established that the soluble blue substance contains not a\r\ntrace of combined citric acid.\r\n\r\nThe precipitated lilac blue substance (obtained by reducing silver\r\ncitrate by ferrous citrate) was thrown on a filter and cleared of\r\nmother water as far as possible with a filter pump. Pure water was\r\nthen poured on in successive portions until more than half the\r\nsubstance was dissolved. The residue, evidently quite unchanged, was,\r\nof course, tolerably free from mother water. It was found that by\r\nevaporating it to dryness over a water bath, most of the silver\r\nseparated out as bright white normal silver; by adding water and\r\nevaporating a second time, the separation was complete, and water\r\nadded dissolved no silver. _The solution thus obtained was neutral._\r\nIt must have been acid had any citric acid been combined originally\r\nwith the silver. This experiment, repeated with every precaution,\r\nseems conclusive. The ferrous solution, used for reducing the silver\r\ncitrate, had been brought to exact neutrality with sodium hydroxide.\r\nAfter the reduction had been effected, the mother water over the lilac\r\nblue precipitate was neutral or faintly acid.\r\n\r\nA corroborating indication is the following: The portions of the lilac\r\nblue substance which were dissolved on the filter (see above) were\r\nreceived into a dilute solution of magnesium sulphate, which throws\r\ndown insoluble allotropic silver of the form I have called B (see\r\nprevious paper). This form has already been shown to be nearly pure\r\nsilver. The magnesia solution, neutral before use, was also neutral\r\nafter it had effected the precipitation, indicating that no citric\r\nacid had been set free in the precipitation of the silver.\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, clear that the lilac blue substance contains no\r\ncombined citric acid. Had the solubility of the silver been due to\r\ncombination with either acid or alkali, the liquid from which it was\r\nseparated by digestion at or below 100° C. must have been acid or\r\nalkaline; it could not have been neutral.\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, this alternative: In the lilac blue substance we\r\nhave either pure silver in a soluble form or else a compound of\r\nsilver, with a perfectly neutral substance generated from citric acid\r\nin the reaction which leads to the formation of the lilac blue\r\nsubstance. If this last should prove the true explanation, then we\r\nhave to do with a combination of silver of a quite different nature\r\nfrom any silver compounds hitherto known. A neutral substance\r\ngenerated from citric acid must have one or more atoms of hydrogen\r\nreplaced by silver. This possibility recalls the recent observations\r\nof Ballo, who, by acting with a ferrous salt on tartaric acid,\r\nobtained a neutral colloid substance having the constitution of\r\narabin, C6 H10 O6.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the difficulty of arriving at a correct conclusion, it\r\nmust be remembered that the silver precipitate is obtained saturated\r\nwith strong solutions of ferric and ferrous citrate, sodium citrate,\r\nsulphate, etc. These cannot be removed by washing with pure water, in\r\nwhich the substance itself is very soluble, but must be got rid of by\r\nwashing with saline solutions, under the influence of which the\r\nsubstance itself slowly but continually changes. Next, the saline\r\nsolution used for washing must be removed by alcohol. During this\r\ntreatment, the substance, at first very soluble, gradually loses its\r\nsolubility, and, when ready for analysis, has become wholly insoluble.\r\nIt is impossible at present to say whether it may not have undergone\r\nother change; this is a matter as to which I hope to speak more\r\npositively later. It is to be remarked, however, that these allotropic\r\nforms of silver acquire and lose solubility from very slight causes,\r\nas an instance of which may be mentioned the ease with which the\r\ninsoluble form B recovers its solubility under the influence of sodium\r\nsulphate and borate, and other salts, as described in the previous\r\npart of this paper.\r\n\r\nThe two insoluble forms of allotropic silver which I have described as\r\nB and C--B, bluish green; C, rich golden color--show the following\r\ncurious reaction. A film of B, spread on glass and heated in a water\r\nstove to 100° C. for a few minutes becomes superficially bright\r\nyellow. A similar film of the gold colored substance, C, treated in\r\nthe same way, acquires a blue bloom. In both cases it is the surface\r\nonly that changes.\r\n\r\n_Sensitiveness to Light._--All these forms of silver are acted upon by\r\nlight. A and B acquire a brownish tinge by some hours' exposure to\r\nsunlight. With C the case is quite different, the color changes from\r\nthat of red gold to that of pure yellow gold. The experiment is an\r\ninteresting one. The exposed portion retains its full metallic\r\nbrilliancy, giving an additional proof that the color depends upon\r\nmolecular arrangement, and this with the allotropic forms of silver is\r\nsubject to change from almost any influence.\r\n\r\n_Stability._--These substances vary greatly in stability under\r\ninfluences difficult to appreciate. I have two specimens of the gold\r\nyellow substance, C, both made in December, 1886, with the same\r\nproportions, under the same conditions. One has passed to dazzling\r\nwhite, normal silver, without falling to powder, or undergoing\r\ndisaggregation of any sort; the fragments have retained their shape,\r\nsimply changing to a pure frosted white, remaining apparently as solid\r\nas before; the other is unchanged, and still shows its deep yellow\r\ncolor and golden luster. Another specimen made within a few months and\r\nsupposed to be permanent has changed to brown. Complete exclusion of\r\nair and light is certainly favorable to permanence.\r\n\r\n_Physical Condition._--The brittleness of the substances B and C, the\r\nfacility with which they can be reduced to the finest powder, makes a\r\nstriking point of difference between allotropic and normal silver. It\r\nis probable that normal silver, precipitated in fine powder and set\r\naside moist to dry gradually, may cohere into brittle lumps, but these\r\nwould be mere aggregations of discontinuous material. With allotropic\r\nsilver the case is very different, the particles dry in optical\r\ncontact with each other, the surfaces are brilliant, and the material\r\nevidently continuous. That this should be brittle indicates a totally\r\ndifferent state of molecular constitution from that of normal silver.\r\n\r\n_Specific Gravities._--The allotropic forms of silver show a lower\r\nspecific gravity than that of normal silver.\r\n\r\nIn determining the specific gravities it was found essential to keep\r\nthe sp. gr. bottle after placing the material in it for some hours\r\nunder the bell of an air pump. Films of air attach themselves\r\nobstinately to the surfaces, and escape but slowly even in vacuo.\r\n\r\nTaken with this precaution, the blue substance, B, gave specific\r\ngravity 9.58, and the yellow substance, C, specific gravity 8.51. The\r\nspecific gravity of normal silver, after melting, was found by G. Rose\r\nto be 10.5. That of finely divided silver obtained by precipitation is\r\nstated to be 10.62.[1]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: Watts' Dict., orig. ed., v. 277.]\r\n\r\nI believe these determinations to be exact for the specimens employed.\r\nBut the condition of aggregation may not improbably vary somewhat in\r\ndifferent specimens. It seems, however, clear that these forms of\r\nsilver have a lower specific gravity than the normal, and this is what\r\nwould be expected.\r\n\r\nChestnut Hill, Philadelphia, May, 1889.\r\n\r\n--_Amer.

In this definite class\r\nturpentine means the exudation from various trees of the natural order\r\nConiferæ, consisting of a hydrocarbon, C10 H16, and a resin. The\r\nconstitution of the hydrocarbons in turpentine from different sources,\r\nthough identical chemically, varies physically, the boiling point\r\nranging from 156° C. to 163° C., the density from 0.855 to 0.880, and\r\nthe action on polarized light from -40.3 to +21.5. They are very\r\nunstable bodies in their molecular constitution, heat, sulphuric acid,\r\nand other reagents modifying their properties. The resins are also\r\nvery variable bodies formed probably by oxidation of the hydrocarbons,\r\nand as this oxidation is more or less complete, mixtures are formed\r\nvery difficult to separate and study.\r\n\r\nTurpentine as met with in commerce is mainly derived from _Pinus\r\nmaritima_, yielding French turpentine, and _Pinus australis_,\r\nfurnishing most of the American turpentine. The latter is obtained\r\nfrom North and South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. In Hanbury and\r\nFluckiger's Pharmacographia there is a full description of the manner\r\nin which the trees are wounded to obtain the turpentine. Besides these\r\nthere are Venice turpentine from the larch, _Pinus Larix_, Strassburg\r\nturpentine from _Abies pectinata_, and Canada balsam from _Pinus\r\nbalsamea_.\r\n\r\nThe crude American turpentine is a viscid liquid of about the\r\nconsistence of honey, but varying to a soft solid, known as gum, thus,\r\naccording to the amount of exposure which it has undergone, it\r\ncontains about 10 to 25 per cent. of \"spirits,\" to which the name of\r\nturpentine is commonly given, the rest being resin, or as it is\r\nusually called, rosin.\r\n\r\nIn Liverpool almost all the spirits of turpentine comes from America,\r\nso that it is almost impossible to get a sample of French.\r\n\r\nThe terpene from American turpentine is called austraterebenthene. It\r\npossesses dextro-rotatory polarization of +21.5. Its density is 0.864.\r\nBoiling point 156° C.\r\n\r\nIn taking the boiling point of a commercial sample of spirits it is\r\nnecessary to wait until the thermometer becomes steady. Not more than\r\n5 per cent. should pass over before this takes place, and then there\r\nis not more than two or three degrees of rise until almost all is\r\ndistilled over.\r\n\r\nThe liquids of lower boiling point do not appear to have been much\r\nstudied. In French spirits they seem to be of the same composition as\r\nthe main product, but with more action on polarized light.\r\n\r\nFrench spirits of turpentine is mainly composed of terebenthene. The\r\nboiling point and sp. gr. are the same as those of the austraterebenthene,\r\nbut the polarization is left handed and amounts to -40.5.\r\n\r\nIsomeric modifications. Heated to 300° C. in a sealed tube for two\r\nhours, it becomes an isomeric compound, boiling at 175° C., while the\r\ndensity is lowered, being only 0.8586 at 0° C. The rotatory power is\r\nonly -9°. It oxidizes much more rapidly. It is called isoterebenthene\r\nand has a smell of essential oil of lemons.\r\n\r\nBy the action of a small quantity of sulphuric acid, among other\r\nproducts terebene is formed. It has the same boiling point and sp. gr.\r\nas terebenthene, but is without action on polarized light.\r\nAustraterebenthene forms similar if not identical bodies.\r\n\r\nPolymers. One part of boron fluoride BF3 instantly converts 160\r\nparts of terebenthene into polymers boiling above 300° C., and\r\noptically inactive. H2 SO4 does the same on heating and forms\r\nditerebene C20 H32.\r\n\r\nTerchloride of antimony does the same, and also produces tetraterebene\r\nC40H64, a solid brittle compound formed by the union of four\r\nmolecules of C10 H16. It does not boil below 350° C. and\r\ndecomposes on heating.\r\n\r\nCompound with H2O. Terpin C10 H18 2HO is formed when 1 volume\r\nof spirits of turpentine is mixed with 6 of nitric acid and 1 of\r\nalcohol, and exposed to air for some weeks. Crystals are formed which\r\nare pressed, decolorized by animal charcoal, and recrystallized from\r\nboiling water.\r\n\r\nCompounds with HCl. When a slow current of HCl is passed through\r\ncooled spirits of turpentine, two isomeric compounds are formed, one\r\nsolid, and one liquid. The lower the temperature is kept, the more of\r\nthe solid body is produced. To obtain the solid body pure it is\r\npressed and recrystallized from ether or alcohol. It is volatile and\r\nhas the odor of camphor. It is called artificial camphor, and has the\r\ncomposition C10 H16 HCl. There is also a compound with 2HCl.\r\n\r\nOxidation products. By passing air into spirits of turpentine oxygen\r\nis absorbed. It was thought at one time that ozone was produced, but\r\nKingzett's view is that camphoric peroxide is formed C10 H14 O4,\r\nand that in presence of water it decomposes into camphoric acid and\r\nH2 O2. This liquid constitutes the disinfectant known as\r\n\"sanitas,\" which possesses the advantages of a pleasant smell and\r\nnon-poisonous properties. C10 H18 O2 may be obtained by\r\nexposing spirits of turpentine in a flask full of oxygen with a little\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nCamphor C16 H16 O has been made in small quantity by oxidizing spirits\r\nof turpentine. Terebenthene belongs to the benzene or aromatic series,\r\nwhich can be shown from its connection with cymene. Cymene is\r\nmethylpropyl-benzene, and can be made from terpenes by removing two\r\natoms of H. It has not yet been converted again into terpene, but the\r\nconnection is sufficiently proved. The presence of CH3 in terpenes is\r\nshown by their yielding chloroform when distilled with bleaching\r\npowder and water. The resin is imperfectly known. It was supposed to\r\nconsist of picric and sylvic acids. It is also stated to contain\r\nabietic anhydride C44 H62 O4, but it is difficult to understand how a\r\ncompound containing C44 can be produced from C10 H16. The most\r\nprobable view is that it is the anhydride of sylvic acid, which is\r\nprobably C20 H30 O2.\r\n\r\nThe dark colored resin which is obtained when the turpentine is\r\ndistilled without water can be converted into a transparent slightly\r\nyellow body by distillation with superheated steam. A small portion is\r\ndecomposed, but the greater part distills unchanged. It is used in\r\nmaking soap which will lather with sea water.\r\n\r\nWhen distilled alone, various hydrocarbons, resin oil and resin pitch,\r\nare obtained.\r\n\r\nI find that commercial spirits of turpentine varies in sp. gr. from\r\n0.865 to 0.869 at 15° C. The higher sp. gr. appears to be connected\r\nwith the presence of resinous bodies, the result of oxidation. The\r\nboiling point is very uniform, ranging from 155° C. to 157° C. at 760\r\nmm. Taking these two points together, it is hardly possible to\r\nadulterate spirits of turpentine without detection. I give the figures\r\nfor a few imitations or adulterations:\r\n\r\n                              Sp. gr.

Partridge, class of\r\n   '89, Univ. of Pa. Read before the Chemical Section of the\r\n   Franklin Institute by Prof. S.P. Sadtler.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the paraffine obtained by the distillation of\r\npetroleum residues is crystalline, while that obtained directly (as in\r\nthe filtration of residuum) is amorphous. Ozokerite or ceresine\r\ndiffers but slightly from paraffine, the principal distinction being\r\nwant of crystalline structure in it as found. Other characteristics,\r\nsuch as the melting point, specific gravity, etc., vary in both, and\r\nso are not of importance in a comparison. Hence it has been asked, Is\r\nthe paraffine occurring in petroleum and ozokerite identical with that\r\nwhich is produced by their distillation? As crystalline paraffine\r\ncould be obtained from ozokerite by distillation alone, many persons\r\nhave supposed that it was engendered in the process. Recently,\r\nhowever, crystalline paraffine has been obtained from ozokerite by\r\ndissolving the latter in warm amyl alcohol; on cooling the greater\r\npart separates out in crystals having the luster of mother-of-pearl.\r\nBy repetition of this process, a substance is obtained that is\r\nscarcely to be distinguished from the paraffine obtained by\r\ndistillation. Apparently there exists then in ozokerite, together with\r\nparaffine, other substances not capable of crystallization which keep\r\nthe paraffine from crystallizing. These colloids appear to be\r\nseparated by amyl alcohol in virtue of their greater solubility in\r\nthat menstruum. It is also reasonable to suppose that they undergo\r\nchange or decomposition by distillation.\r\n\r\nSo as petroleum residues are amorphous, and the crystalline paraffine\r\nis first produced by distillation, it has been argued that the\r\nparaffine present in crude petroleum is approximately the same thing\r\nas ozokerite.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not sufficient to establish the pyrogenic origin of\r\nall crystallized paraffine, as crystals can be obtained from the\r\namorphous residues by distillation at normal or reduced pressure or in\r\na current of steam. To explain these facts two assumptions are\r\npossible. Either the chemical and physical properties of all or some\r\nof the solid constituents are changed by the distillation, and the\r\nparaffine is changed from the amorphous into the crystalline variety,\r\nor the change produced by the distillation takes place in the medium\r\n(i.e., the mother liquid) in which the paraffine exists. The change\r\neffected in ozokerite and in petroleum residues when crystalline\r\nparaffine is obtained by distillation is to be regarded as a\r\npurification, and can be effected partially by treatment with amyl\r\nalcohol. In the same way, by repeated treatment of petroleum residuum\r\nwith amyl alcohol, a substance of melting point 59° C. can be\r\nobtained, which cannot be distinguished from ordinary paraffine.\r\n\r\nThe treatment with amyl alcohol has therefore accomplished the same\r\nresults as was obtained by distillation, and the action is probably\r\nthe same, i.e., a partial separation of colloid substance. These\r\nfacts point to the conclusion that crystallizable paraffine exists\r\nready formed in both petroleum and in ozokerite, but in both cases\r\nother colloidal substances prevent its crystallization. By\r\ndistillation, these colloids appear to be destroyed or changed so as\r\nto allow the paraffine to crystallize.\r\n\r\nIt is a generally known fact that liquids always appear among the\r\nproducts of the distillation of paraffine, no matter in what way the\r\ndistillation be conducted. This shows that some paraffine is\r\ndecomposed in the operation.\r\n\r\nThe name _proto-paraffine_ has been given to ozokerite and to the\r\nparaffine of petroleum in contradistinction to _pyro-paraffine_, the\r\nname that has been applied to the paraffine obtained by distillation\r\nfrom any source.\r\n\r\nAccording to Reichenbach, paraffine may crystallize in three forms:\r\nneedles, angular grains, and leaflets having the luster of\r\nmother-of-pearl. Hofstadter, in an article on the identity of\r\nparaffine from different sources, confirmed this statement, and added\r\nfurther that at first needles, then the angular forms, and then the\r\nleaflets are formed. Fritsche found, by means of the microscope, in\r\nthe ethereal solution of ozokerite, very fine and thin crystal\r\nleaflets concentrically grouped, and in the alcoholic solution fine\r\nirregular leaflets. Zaloziecki has recently developed these\r\nmicroscopic investigations to a much greater extent. According to this\r\nobserver, the principal part of paraffine, as seen under the\r\nmicroscope, consists of shining stratified leaflets with a darker\r\nedge. The most characteristic and well developed crystals are formed\r\nby dissolving paraffine in a mixture of ethyl and amyl alcohols and\r\nchilling. The crystals are rhombic or hexagonal tablets or leaves, and\r\nare quite regularly formed. They are unequally developed in different\r\nvarieties of paraffine. The best developed are those obtained from\r\nceresine. Their relative size and appearance give an indication as to\r\nthe purity of the paraffine, and, as they are always present, they are\r\nto be counted among the characteristic tests for paraffine.\r\nReichenbach observed that mere traces of empyreumatic oil prevented\r\ntheir formation.\r\n\r\nThe old method of determining the amount of paraffine in petroleum was\r\nto carry out the refining process on a small scale; that is, to\r\ndistill the residue from the kerosene oils to coking, chill out the\r\nparaffine, press it thoroughly between filter paper, and weigh the\r\nresidue. The sources of error in this procedure are manifold; the\r\nprincipal one is the solubility of paraffine in oils, which depends\r\nupon the character of both the paraffine and the oil, and also upon\r\nthe temperature. The next greatest source of error is variation in the\r\nprocess of distillation and the difference between working on the\r\nsmall scale and on the large scale.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, where a paraffine determination is to be carried out,\r\none has to deal with a mixture of paraffine with liquid oils. Now,\r\nparaffine is not a substance defined by characteristic physical\r\nproperties which distinguish it from the liquid portions of petroleum.\r\nIt consists of a mixture of homologous hydrocarbons, which form a\r\nsolid under ordinary conditions. The hydrocarbons of this mixture show\r\na gradation in their properties, and gradually approximate to those\r\nwhich are liquid at ordinary temperatures. It is a well known fact\r\nthat a separation of these homologues is entirely impossible by\r\ndistillation. It has also been ascertained that the liquid\r\nconstituents of petroleum do not always possess boiling points that\r\nare lower than those of the solid constituents. This shows that we\r\nhave to deal not merely with hydrocarbons of one, but of several\r\nseries.\r\n\r\nWhen determinations of the amount of paraffine are to be made, then it\r\nbecomes necessary to specify with exactness what is to be called\r\nparaffine. The most definite property that can be made use of for this\r\npurpose is the melting point. For several reasons it is convenient to\r\ninclude under this name hydrocarbons of melting point as low as\r\n35°-40° C.\r\n\r\nThe method proposed by Zaloziecki for the determination of paraffine\r\nis the following: The most volatile portions of the petroleum are\r\nseparated by distillation, until the thermometer shows 200° C. These\r\nportions are separated, as they exert great solvent action upon\r\nparaffine. At the same time he finds that no pyro-paraffine is formed\r\nunder this temperature. A weighed portion of the residue is taken and\r\nmixed with ten parts by weight of amyl alcohol and ten parts of\r\nseventy-five per cent. ethyl alcohol: the mixture is then chilled for\r\ntwelve hours to 0° C. It is then filtered cold, washed first with a\r\nmixture of amyl and ethyl alcohols, and then with ethyl alcohol alone.\r\nThe paraffine is transferred to a small porcelain evaporating dish and\r\ndried at 110° C. It is then heated with concentrated sulphuric acid to\r\n150°-160° C. for fifteen to thirty minutes with constant stirring. The\r\nacid is then neutralized and the paraffine extracted by petroleum\r\nether. On evaporation of the solvent, the paraffine is dried at 100°\r\nC. and weighed. Zaloziecki found, according to this method, in three\r\nsamples of Galician petroleums, 4.6, 5.8 and 6.5 per cent.,\r\nrespectively, of proto-paraffine. The method was carried out as above\r\nwith four samples of American petroleums, Colorado oil from Florence,\r\nCol.; Warren County oil from Wing Well, Warren, Pa.; Washington oil\r\nfrom Washington County, Pa.; Middle District oil from Butler County,\r\nPa., all furnished by Professor Sadtler.\r\n\r\nThey were very different in physical properties and in appearance, the\r\nColorado oil being a much heavier oil than the others and the\r\nWashington oil being an amber oil, while the other two were of the\r\nordinary dark green color and consistence. The losses on distillation\r\nto 200° C. were very different, being about one-tenth in the case of\r\nthe Colorado oil and nearly one-half in the case of the others. The\r\npercentages of partially refined proto-paraffine in the four reduced\r\noils (all below 200° C. off) were as follows: for the Colorado oil,\r\n23.9 per cent.; for the Warren oil, 26.5 per cent.; for the Washington\r\noil, 26.6 per cent.; and for the Middle District oil, 28.2 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe question now arises, What value has this determination of the\r\nproto-paraffine which may exist in an oil? As before said, a portion\r\nof the paraffine is always decomposed in distillation at temperatures\r\nsufficiently high to drive over the paraffine oils, so the yield of\r\npyro-paraffine is always less than the proto-paraffine shown to be\r\npresent originally. Zaloziecki found this in the case of the several\r\nGalician oils he examined. Corresponding to the 4.6, 5.8 and 6.5 per\r\ncent. of proto-paraffine in the several oils he obtained 2.18, 2.65\r\nand 2.35 per cent., respectively, of pyro-paraffine.\r\n\r\nFor the present, however, the extraction of proto-paraffine on a large\r\nscale by means of such solvents as amyl and ethyl alcohols is out of\r\nthe question on account of their cost. A distillation, under reduced\r\npressure and with superheated steam, would, however, prevent much of\r\nthe decomposition of the original proto-paraffine and increase the\r\nyield of pyro-paraffine.\r\n\r\nThis study of Zaloziecki's method and the examination of American oils\r\nwas suggested by Professor Sadtler and carried out in his laboratory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSMISSION OF PRESSURE IN FLUIDS.\r\n\r\nBy ALBERT B. PORTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young student of physics occasionally has difficulty in grasping\r\nthe laws of pressure in fluids. His every day experience has taught\r\nhim that a push against a solid body causes it to push in the same\r\ndirection, and he often receives with some doubt the statement that\r\npressure applied to a fluid is transmitted equally in every direction.\r\nThe experiments ordinarily shown in illustration of this principle\r\nprove that pressure is transmitted in all directions, but do not prove\r\nthe equality of transmission, and in spite of all the text books may\r\ntell him, the student is apt to cling to the idea that a downward\r\npressure applied to a liquid is more apt to burst the bottom than the\r\nside of the containing vessel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 1. and 2.]\r\n\r\nThe little piece of apparatus shown in Fig. 1 was designed to furnish\r\na clear demonstration of the principle under consideration. It is\r\nessentially an arrangement by which a downward pressure is applied to\r\na confined mass of air or water, and the resultant pressures measured\r\nin the three directions, down, up, and sideways. By means of a broken\r\nrat tail file kept wet with turpentine three holes are bored through a\r\nbottle, one through the bottom, one through the side, and one through\r\nthe shoulder, as near the neck as may be convenient. The operation is\r\nquick and easy, the only precaution to be observed being to work very\r\nslowly and use but a slight pressure when the glass is nearly\r\nperforated. The holes may be enlarged to any size required by careful\r\nfiling with the wet file. From each of the holes a rubber tube leads\r\nto one of the glass manometer tubes at the right in the figure, the\r\njoints being made air tight by slipping into each rubber tube a piece\r\nof glass tubing about half an inch long in order to swell it to the\r\nsize of the hole it is to fit. The ends of these glass tubes must be\r\nwell rounded by partial fusion in a gas flame, that there may be no\r\nsharp edges to cut the rubber. The bottle rests in a depression in the\r\nturned wood base, the lower rubber tube passing out through a hole in\r\nthe wood. Fig. 2 shows the shape of the manometer tubes. They are made\r\nof quarter inch glass tubing bent to shape in a flame and left open at\r\nboth ends. They are mounted on a scale board which has several\r\nequidistant horizontal lines running across it. The two bent wires\r\nwhich support the scale board fit loosely in holes in it and in the\r\nbase. This method of mounting is very handy, since it permits the\r\nscale board to be swung to right or left as may be convenient, or\r\nturned round so as to show the fittings on its back, without moving\r\nthe bottle. The three manometers are filled to the same level with\r\nmercury, the quantity being adjusted by means of a pipette. A\r\nperforated rubber stopper, fitted with a glass tube on which is\r\nslipped a rubber syringe bulb, completes the apparatus.\r\n\r\nWhen the bulb is pinched between the fingers, the mercury is forced up\r\nto the same height in each of the manometers, thus proving that the\r\npressure is exerted equally in the three directions, up, down, and\r\nsideways. With the bottle filled with water the same effect follows,\r\nthe law being the same for liquids and gases. When using water in the\r\napparatus it is essential that the rubber tubes, as well as the\r\nbottle, be filled, and when used in the class room it is better to\r\nshow the experiment with water first, it being easier and quicker to\r\nempty the bottle and tubes than to fill them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAR DUCHESSE D'ANGOULEME.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough well known to fruit growers and generally represented in all\r\nparts of Britain, this noble French pear has not become a universal\r\nfavorite. If the quality of the fruit, independently of its fine,\r\nhandsome appearance, was bad, or even indifferent, it might be\r\nexterminated from our lists, but this we know is not the case, as any\r\none who has tasted good samples grown in France, the Channel Islands,\r\nand upon favorable soils in this country will bear out the statement\r\nthat the flavor is superb. Some fruits, we know, are quite incapable\r\nof being good, as they have no quality in them; but here we have one\r\nof the hardiest of trees, capable of giving us quantity as well as\r\nquality, provided we cultivate properly. Pears, no doubt, are\r\ncapricious, like our seasons, but given a good average year, soils and\r\nstocks which suit them, a light, warm, airy aspect, and good culture,\r\na great number of varieties formerly only good enough for stewing are\r\nnow elevated, and most deservedly so, to the dessert table. But,\r\nassuming that some sorts known to be good do not reach their highest\r\nstandard of excellence every year, they are infinitely superior to\r\nmany of the old stewers, as they carry their own sugar, a quality\r\nwhich fits them for consumption by the most delicate invalids. Indeed,\r\nso prominently have choice dessert pears, and apples too for that\r\nmatter, come to the front for cooking purposes, that a new demand is\r\nnow established, and although Duchesse d'Angoulême, always juicy and\r\nsweet, from bad situations does not always come up to the fine quality\r\nmet within Covent Garden in November, it is worthy of our skill, as we\r\nknow it has all the good points of a first rate pear when properly\r\nripened.\r\n\r\nThe original tree of this pear was observed by M. Anne Pierre\r\nAndusson, a nurseryman at Angers, growing in a farm garden near\r\nChampigne, in Anjou, and having procured grafts of it, he sold the\r\ntrees, in 1812, under the name of Poire des Eparannais. In 1820, he\r\nsent a basket of the fruit to the Duchesse d'Angoulême, with a request\r\nto be permitted to name the pear in honor of her. The request was\r\ngranted, and the pear has since borne its present name.\r\n\r\nThat such a fine pear, which does so well in France, would soon find\r\nits way to England there exists little doubt, as we find that within a\r\nfew years it became established and well known throughout the United\r\nKingdom. All the earliest trees would be worked upon the pear or free\r\nstock, and as root pruning until recently was but little practiced, we\r\nmay reasonably suppose that the majority of them are deeply anchored\r\nin clay, marl, and other subsoils calculated to force a crude, gross\r\ngrowth from which high flavored fruit could not be expected. These\r\ndefects under modern culture upon the quince and double grafting are\r\ngiving way, as we find, on reference to the report of the committee of\r\nthe pear conference, held at Chiswick in 1885, that twenty counties in\r\nEngland, also Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, contributed no less than\r\n121 dishes to the tables, and thirty-eight growers voted in favor of\r\nthe Duchesse being recognized as one of our standard dessert\r\nvarieties. This step looks like progress, as it is a record of facts\r\nwhich cannot be gainsaid, and it now remains to be seen whether the\r\nEnglish grower, whose indomitable will has brought him to the front in\r\nthe subjugation of other fruits, will be successful with the fine\r\nDuchesse d'Angoulême. Although this remarkable pear cannot easily be\r\nmistaken, for the benefit of those who do not know it, the following\r\ndescription may not be out of place. Fruit large, often very large, 3½\r\ninches wide and 3 inches to 4 inches high, roundish obovate, uneven,\r\nand bossed in its outline. Skin greenish yellow, changing to pale dull\r\nyellow, covered with veins and freckles of pale brown russet, and when\r\ngrown against a south wall it acquires a brown cheek. Eye open, with\r\nerect dry segments, set in a deep irregular basin. Stalk 1 inch long,\r\ninserted in a deep irregular cavity. Flesh white, buttery, and\r\nmelting, with a rich flavor when well ripened; otherwise rather coarse\r\ngrained and gritty.\r\n\r\nAs to culture, experienced fruitists say the tree grows vigorously and\r\nwell. It bears abundantly, and succeeds either on the pear or quince\r\nstock, forming handsome pyramids, but is better on the quince. Here,\r\nthen, we have the key to the secret of success: The cordon on the\r\nquince; roots near the surface; loam, sound, sandy, and good; and good\r\nfeeding. Aspect, a good wall facing south or west--the latter,\r\nperhaps, the best. Those who have not already done so, should try\r\ntrees on the quince as pyramids and bushes, as this, like some other\r\ncapricious pears, although the fruit be smaller, may put in better\r\nflavor than is met with in fruit from hot walls.--_The Garden._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESSION OF FOREST GROWTHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is from an address delivered by Mr. Robert Douglas\r\nbefore the Association of American Nurserymen at the meeting in\r\nChicago recently.\r\n\r\nIt is the prevailing and almost universal belief that when native\r\nforests are destroyed they will be replaced by other kinds, for the\r\nsimple reason that the soil has been impoverished of the constituents\r\nrequired for the growth of that particular tree or trees. This I\r\nbelieve to be one of the fallacies handed down from past ages, taken\r\nfor granted, and never questioned. Nowhere does the English oak grow\r\nbetter than where it grew when William the Conqueror found it at the\r\ntime he invaded Britain. Where do you find white pines growing better\r\nthan in parts of New England where this tree has grown from time\r\nimmemorial? Where can you find young redwoods growing more thriftily\r\nthan among their giant ancestors, nearly or quite as old as the\r\nChristian era?\r\n\r\nThe question why the original growth is not reproduced can best be\r\nanswered by some illustrations. When a pine forest is burned over,\r\nboth trees and seeds are destroyed, and as the burned trees cannot\r\nsprout from the stump like oaks and many other trees, the land is left\r\nin a condition well suited for the germination of tree seeds, but\r\nthere are no seeds to germinate. It is an open field for pioneers to\r\nenter, and the seeds which arrive there first have the right of\r\npossession. The aspen poplar (_Populus tremuloides_) has the advantage\r\nover all other trees. It is a native of all our northern forests, from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific. Even fires cannot eradicate it, as it\r\ngrows in moist as well as dry places, and sprouts from any part of the\r\nroot. It is a short-lived tree, consequently it seeds when quite young\r\nand seeds abundantly; the seeds are light, almost infinitesimal, and\r\nare carried on wings of down. Its seeds ripen in spring, and are\r\ncarried to great distances at the very time when the ground is in the\r\nbest condition for them. Even on the dry mountain sides in Colorado,\r\nthe snows are just melting and the ground is moist where they fall.\r\n\r\nTo grow this tree from seed would require the greatest skill of the\r\nnurseryman, but the burnt land is its paradise. Wherever you see it on\r\nhigh, dry land you may rest assured that a fire has been there. On\r\nland slides you will not find its seeds germinating, although they\r\nhave been deposited there as abundantly as on the burned land.\r\n\r\nNext to the aspen and poplars comes the canoe birch, and further north\r\nthe yellow birch, and such other trees as have provision for\r\nscattering their seeds. I have seen acorns and nuts germinating in\r\nclusters on burned lands in a few instances. They had evidently been\r\nburied there by animals and had escaped the fires. I have seen the red\r\ncherry (_Prunus Pennsylvanica_) coming up in great quantities where\r\nthey might never have germinated had not the fires destroyed the\r\ndebris which covered the seed too deeply.\r\n\r\nA careful examination around the margin of a burned forest will show\r\nthe trees of surrounding kinds working in again. Thus by the time the\r\nshort-lived aspens (and they are very short-lived on high land) have\r\nmade a covering on the burned land, the surrounding kinds will be\r\nfound re-established in the new forest, the seeds of the conifers,\r\ncarried in by the winds, the berries by the birds, the nuts and acorns\r\nby the squirrels, the mixture varying more or less from the kinds\r\nwhich grew there before the fire.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful how far the seeds of berries are carried by birds. The\r\nwaxwings and cedar birds carry seeds of our tartarean honeysuckles,\r\npurple barberries and many other kinds four miles distant, where we\r\nsee them spring up on the lake shore, where these birds fly in flocks\r\nto feed on the juniper berries. It seems to be the same everywhere. I\r\nfound European mountain ash trees last summer in a forest in New\r\nHampshire; the seed must have been carried over two miles as the crow\r\nflies.\r\n\r\nWhile this alternation is going on in the East, and may have been\r\ngoing on for thousands of years, the Rocky Mountain district is not so\r\nfortunate. When a forest is burned down in that dry region, it is\r\ndoubtful if coniferous trees will ever grow again, except in some\r\nlocalities specially favored. I have seen localities where short-lived\r\ntrees were dying out and no others taking their places. Such spots\r\nwill hereafter take their places above the timber line, which seems to\r\nme to be a line governed by circumstances more than by altitude or\r\nquality of soil.\r\n\r\nThere are a few exceptions where pines will succeed pines in a\r\nburned-down forest. _Pinus Murrayana_ grows up near the timber line in\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. This tree has persistent cones which adhere to\r\nthe trees for many years. I have counted the cones of sixteen years on\r\none of these trees, and examined burned forests of this species, where\r\nmany of the cones had apparently been bedded in the earth as the trees\r\nfell. The heat had opened the cones and the seedlings were growing up\r\nin myriads; but not a conifer of any other kind could be seen as far\r\nas the fire had reached.\r\n\r\nIn the Michigan Peninsula, northern Wisconsin and Minnesota, _P.\r\nBanksiana_, a comparatively worthless tree, is replacing the valuable\r\nred pine (_P. resinosa_), and in the Sierras _P. Murrayana_ and _P.\r\ntuberculata_ are replacing the more valuable species by the same\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nIn this case, also, the worthless trees are the shortest lived. So we\r\nsee that nature is doing all that she can to remedy the evil. Man only\r\nis reckless, and especially the American man. The Mexican will cut\r\nlarge limbs off his trees for fuel, but will spare the tree. Even the\r\npoor Indian, when at the starvation point, stripping the bark from the\r\nyellow pine (_P. ponderosa_), for the mucilaginous matter being formed\r\ninto sap wood, will never take a strip wider than one third the\r\ncircumference of the tree, so that its growth may not be injured.\r\n\r\nWe often read that oaks are springing up in destroyed forests where\r\noaks had never grown before. The writers are no doubt sincere, but\r\nthey are careless. The only pine forests where oaks are not intermixed\r\nare either in land so sandy that oaks cannot be made to grow on them\r\nat all, or so far north that they are beyond their northern limit. In\r\nthe Green Mountains and in the New England forests, in the pine\r\nforests in Pennsylvania, in the Adirondacks, in Wisconsin and\r\nMichigan--except in sand--I have found oaks mixed with the pines and\r\nspruces. In northwestern Minnesota and in northern Dakota the oaks are\r\nnear their northern limit, but even there the burr oak drags on a bare\r\nexistence among the pines and spruces. In the Black Hills, in Dakota,\r\npoor, forlorn, scrubby burr oaks are scattered through the hills among\r\nthe yellow pines. In Colorado we find them as shrubs among the pines\r\nand Douglas spruces. In New Mexico we find them scattered among the\r\npiñons. In Arizona they grow like hazel bushes among the yellow pines.\r\nOn the Sierra Nevada the oak region crosses the pine region, and\r\nscattering oaks reach far up into the mountains. Yet oaks will not\r\nflourish between the one hundredth meridian and the eastern base of\r\nthe Sierras, owing to the aridity of the climate. I recently found\r\noaks scattered among the redwoods on both sides of the Coast Range\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nDarwin has truly said, \"The oaks are driving the pines to the sands.\"\r\nWherever the oak is established--and we have seen that it is already\r\nestablished whereever it can endure the soil and climate--there it\r\nwill remain and keep on advancing. The oak produces comparatively few\r\nseeds. Where it produces a hundred, the ash and maple will yield a\r\nthousand, the elm ten thousand, and many other trees a hundred\r\nthousand. The acorn has no provision for protection and transportation\r\nlike many tree seeds. Many kinds are furnished with wings to float\r\nthem on the water and carry them in the air. Nearly every tree seed,\r\nexcept the acorn, has a case to protect it while growing, either\r\nopening and casting the seeds off to a distance when ripe or falling\r\nwith them to protect them till they begin to germinate. Even the\r\nequally large seeds of other kinds are protected in some way. The\r\nhickory nut has a hard shell, which shell itself is protected by a\r\nstrong covering until ripe. The black walnut has both a hard shell and\r\na fleshy covering. The acorn is the only seed I can think of which is\r\nleft by nature to take care of itself. It matures without protection,\r\nfalls heavily and helplessly to the ground, to be eaten and trodden on\r\nby animals, yet the few which escape and those which are trodden under\r\nare well able to compete in the race for life. While the elm and maple\r\nseeds are drying up on the surface, the hickories and the walnuts\r\nwaiting to be cracked, the acorn is at work with its coat off. It\r\ndrives its tap root into the earth in spite of grass, and brush, and\r\nlitter. No matter if it is shaded by forest trees so that the sun\r\ncannot penetrate, it will manage to make a short stem and a few leaves\r\nthe first season, enough to keep life in the root, which will drill in\r\ndeeper and deeper. When age or accident removes the tree which has\r\novershadowed it, then it will assert itself. Fires may run over the\r\nland, destroying almost everything else, the oak will be killed to the\r\nground, but it will throw up a new shoot the next spring, the root\r\nwill keep enlarging, and when the opportunity arrives it will make a\r\nvigorous growth, in proportion to the strength of the root, and throw\r\nout strong side roots, and after that care no more for its tap root,\r\nwhich has been its only support, than the frog cares for the tail of\r\nthe tadpole after it has got on its own legs.\r\n\r\nThere is no mystery about the succession of forest growths, nothing in\r\nnature is more plain and simple. We cannot but admire her wisdom,\r\neconomy, and justness, compensating in another direction for any\r\ndisadvantage a species may have to labor under. Every kind of tree has\r\nan interesting history in itself. Seeds with a hard shell, or with a\r\npulpy or resinous covering which retards their germination, are often\r\nsaved from becoming extinct by these means.\r\n\r\nThe red cedar (_Juniperus Virginiana_) reaches from Florida to and\r\nbeyond Cape Cod; it is among the hills of Tennessee, through the\r\nMiddle States and New England. It is scattered through the Western\r\nStates and Territories, at long distances apart, creeping up the\r\nPlatte River, in Nebraska. (I found only three in the Black Hills, in\r\nDakota, in an extended search for the different trees which grow\r\nthere. Found only one in a long ramble in the hills at Las Vegas, New\r\nMexico.) Yet this tree has crept across the continent, and is found\r\nhere and there in a northwesterly direction between the Platte and the\r\nPacific Coast. It is owing to the resinous coating which protects its\r\nseeds that this tree is found to-day scattered over that immense\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[NATURE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"HATCHERY\" OF THE SUN-FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have thought that an example of the intelligence (instinct?) of a\r\nclass of fish which has come under my observation during my excursions\r\ninto the Adirondack region of New York State might possibly be of\r\ninterest to your readers, especially as I am not aware that any one\r\nexcept myself has noticed it, or, at least, has given it publicity.\r\n\r\nThe female sun-fish (called, I believe, in England, the roach or\r\nbream) makes a \"hatchery\" for her eggs in this wise. Selecting a spot\r\nnear the banks of the numerous lakes in which this region abounds, and\r\nwhere the water is about 4 inches deep, and still, she builds, with\r\nher tail and snout, a circular embankment 3 inches in height and 2\r\nthick. The circle, which is as perfect a one as could be formed with\r\nmathematical instruments, is usually a foot and a half in diameter;\r\nand at one side of this circular wall an opening is left by the fish\r\nof just sufficient width to admit her body, thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe mother sun-fish, having now built or provided her \"hatchery,\"\r\ndeposits her spawn within the circular inclosure, and mounts guard at\r\nthe entrance until the fry are hatched out and are sufficiently large\r\nto take charge of themselves. As the embankment, moreover, is built up\r\nto the surface of the water, no enemy can very easily obtain an\r\nentrance within the inclosure from the top; while there being only one\r\nentrance, the fish is able, with comparative ease, to keep out all\r\nintruders.\r\n\r\nI have, as I say, noticed this beautiful instinct of the sun-fish for\r\nthe perpetuity of her species more particularly in the lakes of this\r\nregion; but doubtless the same habit is common to these fish in other\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nWilliam L. Stone.\r\n\r\nJersey City Heights, N.J.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT LAKE DWELLINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many traces which man has left of his existence in long past\r\nages on the face of the earth, says a correspondent of the _Scotsman_,\r\nnone are more interesting and instructive than the lake dwellings of\r\nSwitzerland and other countries, which have been discovered within the\r\nlast fifty years or so. Although these relics of the past are far more\r\nmodern than those which we referred to in a late article on \"Primeval\r\nMan,\" and are probably included within the range of Egyptian and\r\nother chronologies, yet they stretch far beyond the historic period,\r\nso far as Europe is concerned, and throw a flood of light on the\r\nhabits of our ancestors, or at any rate predecessors, in these\r\nregions. We are tolerably well acquainted with the history of the Jews\r\nwhen David worked his way up from the shepherd's staff to the royal\r\nscepter, or when Joshua drove out the Canaanites and took possession\r\nof their land, but of what was going on in Europe in these times we\r\nhave hitherto had no knowledge whatever. These lake dwellings,\r\nhowever, were in all probability inhabited by human beings somewhere\r\nabout the time when the events we have referred to took place, and may\r\nhave been inhabited before the earlier of them.\r\n\r\nThe first hint we had of the existence of these remarkable dwellings\r\nwas obtained in 1829, when an excavation was being made on the shore\r\nof a Swiss lake. Some wooden piles, apparently very old, and other\r\nantiquities were found by the workmen. Not much attention, however,\r\nwas paid to this discovery till 1854, when a Mr. Aeppli drew attention\r\nto some remains of human handiwork found near his house, in part of\r\nthe bed of a lake which had been left dry during a season of great\r\ndrought. The workmen employed in recovering some land from the lake\r\nfound the heads of a great many wooden piles protruding through the\r\nmud, and also a number of stags' horns, and implements of various\r\ndescriptions. Stimulated by this discovery, search was made in various\r\nlakes, and the result was truly astonishing. In every direction\r\nremains of the habitations of prehistoric man were discovered, and\r\nrelics were found in such abundance that the history of this unknown\r\npast could be traced through long ages, and the habits of the people\r\nascertained with a very considerable amount of probability. The\r\ndetails are so numerous that it would be impossible in the space at\r\nour disposal to go into them all.\r\n\r\nOf course, during the long time that has elapsed since these\r\nstructures were erected, their remains have been reduced to mere\r\nruins, and it is only by comparing one with another that we are able\r\nto picture to ourselves what they were originally like and what sort\r\nof life was led by the men who inhabited them. The oldest of these\r\ndwellings belong to the stone age, when man had not acquired any\r\nknowledge of the use of metal; when all his instruments were merely\r\nsharpened stones, fixed in wooden handles, or pieces of bone, horn, or\r\nother natural material. They are therefore somewhat roughly finished,\r\nbut at the same time exhibit considerable ingenuity and skill. The\r\nmethod of construction seems to have been somewhat as follows: A\r\nsuitable situation, not far from the shore, where the water was not\r\nvery deep, having been fixed upon, these prehistoric builders drove\r\ninto the muddy bottom of the lake a number of piles or long stakes,\r\narranged generally pretty close together, and in some sort of regular\r\norder. These piles were formed generally from stems of trees, with the\r\nbark on, but occasionally from split wood. The ends were sharpened to\r\na point by the aid of fire or by cutting with stone axes. On a\r\nsufficient number being driven in, and their upper ends brought to a\r\nlevel above the surface of the water, platform beams were laid across,\r\nfastened by wooden pegs, or in some cases fixed into notches cut in\r\nthe heads of the vertical piles. The platform was generally very\r\nroughly made, just a series of unbarked stems placed side by side and\r\ncovered with layers of earth or clay, with numerous openings through\r\nwhich refuse of all kinds fell into the water beneath. In many cases\r\nconnection with the shore was made by means of a narrow bridge or\r\ngangway, constructed in the same manner. On this rude platform huts\r\nwere erected by driving small piles or stakes which projected above\r\nthe floor, and to these were fastened boards standing edgeways like\r\nthe skirting of our ordinary rooms, and marking out the size of each\r\nbuilding. The walls of the huts were formed of small branches of twigs\r\ninterwoven and plastered over with clay. The roof was made of straw or\r\nreeds like a thatched cottage. In size these huts were probably\r\neighteen to twenty feet long, eight or ten feet broad, and about six\r\nfeet high. They may have been divided into rooms, but there is no\r\nevidence of this. Each was provided with a hearth formed of three or\r\nfour slabs of stone. The number of huts in each settlement must have\r\nbeen considerable, in fact, they must have formed villages of no mean\r\nextent, for as many as forty, fifty, or even a hundred thousand piles\r\nhave been found spread over a large extent of ground, forming the\r\nfoundation of one such settlement. It is probable, however, that these\r\nwere not so numerous when first erected, but were gradually added to\r\nas the population increased. This fact, along with many others, shows\r\nthat these dwellings were inhabited for long periods of time, during\r\nwhich the population pursued their ordinary life in comparative peace\r\nand quietness in their island homes.\r\n\r\nSuch is, in brief, a general account of these remarkable structures.\r\nOf course there were several variations in the methods of fixing these\r\npiles, one of which may be mentioned as showing the ingenuity of the\r\nbuilders. Where the piles did not get a firm hold of the lake bottom,\r\nthey carried out in boats or rafts loads of stones, which they threw\r\ndown between the piles, thus firmly fixing them, just as modern\r\nengineers sometimes do for a similar purpose. As to the habits of the\r\npeople who dwelt in these lake dwellings, we get a considerable amount\r\nof information from the various implements, refuse, etc., which fell\r\nthrough the imperfectly closed platforms into the lake, and which have\r\nbeen preserved in the mud at the bottom. They were fishers, hunters,\r\nshepherds, and agriculturists. Skeletons of fish are found in large\r\nabundance, and in some settlements even the fishing nets, and hooks\r\nmade of boar's tusks, have been discovered. Then again there is an\r\nabundance of remains of the hunter's feast; bones of the stag, wild\r\nboar, bear, wolf, otter, squirrel, and many other wild animals are\r\nfound in rich profusion, and often these are split and the marrow\r\nextracted. These ancient men, however, did not entirely rely on such\r\nprecarious provision for their wants, but were so far advanced in\r\ncivilization that they kept cattle and domestic animals of various\r\nkinds. They possessed dogs in great numbers, as well as cows, sheep,\r\ngoats, and pigs, and in winter time had these housed on their\r\nsettlements, as among the remains found are litters of straw, etc.,\r\nwhich had evidently served as bedding for these animals. This, of\r\ncourse, necessitated the gathering of grass or other material for\r\ntheir food. They also cultivated wheat, barley, flax, and a number of\r\nother vegetable products. Their methods of cultivation were no doubt\r\nvery rude, consisting of a mere scratching of the ground with crooked\r\nbranches of trees or with simple instruments made of stags' horn; but,\r\nnevertheless, they succeeded in getting very good results. Among the\r\nrelics which they have left are found stones for crushing corn, the\r\ngrain which they used, and even the very cakes or bread which they\r\nmade. There are also fruits, such as the apple, pear, nut, etc.; so\r\nthat the bill of fare of prehistoric man was by no means contemptible.\r\nHe had fish, game, beef, mutton, pork, bread, and fruit, besides a\r\nplentiful supply of water from the lake at his door. He was acquainted\r\nwith the potter's art, and manufactured earthen vessels of various\r\nkinds. He seems to have produced two kinds--a coarser and a finer; the\r\nformer made from clay mixed with a quantity of grains of stone, and\r\nthe latter of washed loam. These he ornamented in an elementary\r\nfashion with certain lines and marks. Some of the vessels he used have\r\nbeen found with a burnt crust of the porridge which he had been making\r\nadhering. As to his clothes, these were probably formed in great part\r\nfrom the skins of wild or domestic animals, but he also used fabrics\r\nmade from flax, which he had learned to weave, as remains of cloth,\r\ntwine, rope, etc., are not infrequently found in his dwellings.\r\n\r\nOne prominent feature in the history of these lake dwellers is their\r\ngradual advance in the arts of civilization. While the main features\r\nof their settlements remain very much the same during the whole period\r\nof their residence, there is a gradual improvement in the details; the\r\nsettlements become larger, and the implements, etc., better finished.\r\nAnd this is especially observable in the change of material which the\r\ndweller uses. In the earlier stages of his existence stone is the\r\npredominant feature, all his knives, saws, chisels, axes, etc., are\r\nmade from this substance; but as time rolls on, one or two implements\r\nare found made of bronze, which is a mixture of tin and copper, and\r\nrequires for its production a certain amount of knowledge and\r\nmechanical skill. Gradually the number of bronze implements increases\r\nuntil eventually stone is superseded altogether, and improved forms of\r\nweapons of war make their appearance, and his work has a more finished\r\nlook, arising from his improved implements. Whether the manufacture of\r\nbronze was an original discovery of his own, or whether it was an\r\nimportation from some more advanced race, is not certainly known; but\r\nas he undoubtedly had intercourse with the East, it is probable that\r\nthe first bronze was imported, and that afterward he discovered the\r\nway to manufacture it himself. However this may be, it seems evident\r\nthat the introduction of this material greatly aided his development.\r\nAs stone gave place to bronze, so in the course of time this latter\r\ngave place to iron, probably introduced in the same manner some\r\nconsiderable time before the dawn of history; and this metal held its\r\nplace until these habitations were finally abandoned.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the religion of these lake dwellers, if they had any,\r\nnothing is known. From some curious objects formed somewhat like the\r\ncrescent of the moon, which are found in considerable numbers, it has\r\nbeen supposed that they worshiped that body; but there seems to be\r\nreally no evidence for this supposition, and these objects may only\r\nhave been ornaments, or perhaps charms, fixed above the doors of their\r\nhuts something after the manner of the horse shoe nailed over the door\r\nin modern times to keep away evil spirits. So far as can be inferred\r\nfrom the remains that have been examined, the same race seems to have\r\ninhabited these dwellings from their commencement to their end. There\r\nis no appearance of invasion from without; all seems continuous.\r\nProbably his race came in early time from the East, and were a\r\npastoral people, with flocks, herds, and domestic animals, and built\r\ntheir peculiar habitations to protect themselves from human enemies.\r\nCertainly the arrangements were well fitted for the purpose in those\r\ndays, when the club and the spear were almost the only weapons of\r\noffense. Dr. Keller, who has investigated this subject with great\r\ncare, is of the opinion that these lake dwellers were a branch of the\r\ngreat Celtic race.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[New England Farmer.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO RAISE TURKEYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best feed for young turkeys and ducks is yelks of hard-boiled\r\neggs, and after they are several days old the white may be added.\r\nContinue this for two or three weeks, occasionally chopping onions\r\nfine and sometimes sprinkling the boiled eggs with black pepper; then\r\ngive rice, a teacupful with enough milk to just cover it, and boil\r\nslowly until the milk is evaporated. Put in enough more to cover the\r\nrice again, so that when boiled down the second time it will be soft\r\nif pressed between the fingers. Milk must not be used too freely, as\r\nit will get too soft and the grains will adhere together. Stir\r\nfrequently when boiling. Do not use water with the rice, as it forms a\r\npaste and the chicks cannot swallow it. In cold, damp weather, a half\r\nteaspoonful of Cayenne pepper in a pint of flour, with lard enough to\r\nmake it stick together, will protect them from diarrhea. This amount\r\nof food is sufficient for two meals for seventy-five chicks. Give all\r\nfood in shallow tin pans. Water and boiled milk, with a little lime\r\nwater in each occasionally, is the best drink until the chicks are two\r\nor three months old, when loppered and buttermilk may take the place\r\nof the boiled milk. Turkeys like best to roost on trees, and in their\r\nplace artificial roots may be made by planting long forked locust\r\npoles and laying others across the forks.--_American Agriculturist._\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO RAISE TURKEYS.\r\n\r\nKeep the turkey hens tame by feeding them close to the house. Have two\r\nor three barrels in sheltered corners containing plenty of straw or\r\nleaves for them to lay in. Gather the eggs every evening, as turkey\r\neggs are very easily chilled. Keep the eggs in a woolen cloth on end\r\nand turn them every three days. Set the first seven eggs under a\r\nchicken hen, as they get too old before the turkey hen will go to\r\nsitting. Make a board pen ten or twelve feet square and twelve or\r\nfourteen inches high. Put a coop in it and put your hen and turkeys in\r\nit. Feed the hen with corn and the turkeys soaked wheat bread (corn\r\nmeal will kill them), until they are a week old (I feed five or six\r\ntimes a day). Then feed wheat until they are big enough to eat corn.\r\nGive plenty of fresh water in a shallow vessel. Keep the mother in\r\nthe pen until they are large enough to fly over the top of the boards.\r\nLet them out awhile about the middle of the day. Shut them in at\r\nnight. A turkey hen does not like to be shut up, but have a good big\r\ncoop for her and she will go in. Don't let the little turkeys get\r\ntheir backs wet until they are feathered. The turkey hen will sit down\r\nwhen night comes just where she happens to be, but if you drive her\r\nhome a few times she will come herself after that. Always feed them\r\nwhen they come home, no matter if they are full of \"hoppers.\" Have\r\nyour No. 2 pen in the orchard under an apple tree where it is shady.\r\nHave the turkey hen's pen close to the chicken hen's pen, so that when\r\nthe chicken hen weans her turkeys, they will soon learn to go with the\r\nturkey hen. Give them a dose of black pepper in their feed every cold\r\nrain. And never, no never, get excited and in a hurry while working\r\nwith turkeys if you don't want them to get wild and fly all over the\r\nplantation. Three or four weeks before selling, feed all the corn they\r\nwill eat.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD HINTS.\r\n\r\nRestrain your desire to count your young turkeys, and let them alone\r\nfor twenty-four hours after they get into this world. Remove them to a\r\nclean, airy, roomy coop, and give them boiled eggs, stale wheat bread\r\ncrumbs just moistened with milk or water, \"Dutch\" cheese, or a mixture\r\nof all these.\r\n\r\nFor the first two weeks feed entirely with the eggs, bread, curds,\r\ncooked rice and cooked oatmeal. About the third week commence feeding\r\ncooked cornmeal; and from that on they may have any cooked food that\r\nwould be suitable for chickens of the same age. Season all food\r\nslightly with salt and pepper, and twice a week add a level\r\ntablespoonful of bone meal to a pint of feed. Never feed any sour food\r\nor sloppy food of any kind, except sour milk, and never feed any\r\nuncooked food of any kind until after they have thrown out the red on\r\ntheir heads. Feed often, five or six times a day, until after they are\r\nthree months old; then, if insects are numerous, you may gradually\r\nreduce the number of meals per day to three or even two.\r\n\r\nAfter they are three months old they may be given wheat, cracked corn,\r\netc., but not whole corn until they are five months old. Keep the\r\ncoops dry and clean, and the turkeys out of the dew and rain until\r\nthey are fully feathered, and have thrown out the red. Dampness and\r\nfilth will kill young turkeys as surely as a dose of poison. For the\r\nfirst few days confine the poults to the limits of the coop and safety\r\nrun; then, if all appear strong and well, give the mother hen and her\r\nbrood liberty on pleasant days after the dew is off.\r\n\r\nIf they get caught out in a shower, get them to shelter as soon as\r\npossible; and if they are chilled take them to the house and\r\nthoroughly dry and warm them. See that the little turkeys come home\r\nevery night. The turkey mother must, for the first few nights, be\r\nhunted up and driven home. After they are three months old, turkeys\r\nare quite hardy, and may be allowed range at all times. If turkeys\r\nthat are well cared for, and have always seemed all right, show signs\r\nof drooping when about six weeks or two months old, give Douglas\r\nmixture in the drink or food, and add a little cooked meat to the food\r\nonce a day.--_The Practical Farmer._\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT SITTING.\r\n\r\nFor an ordinary place, select from a good breed (I prefer the bronze)\r\na large gobbler and two or three hens. As soon as the warm weather\r\ncomes, place about the barn in sheltered places two or three barrels\r\non their sides, and in them make nice nests. In these the hens will\r\nlay. Gather the eggs every day, keeping them in a cool place. When a\r\nbox contains 23 eggs mark it No. 1 and begin to fill a second box, and\r\nwhen it contains 23 eggs mark it No. 2 and so continue. It is well to\r\nleave turkey hens on the nest two or three days, for they often lay\r\none or two eggs after they begin to show signs of sitting.\r\n\r\nWhen you have decided to sit a hen, give her a good nest and 15 eggs\r\nand at the same time give a common hen eight eggs. These, when\r\nhatched, are all to be given to the turkey hen. Never try to raise\r\nturkeys with a domestic fowl. If you have no place free of grass, you\r\ncan start turkeys with difficulty. Feeding is of the greatest\r\nimportance. For the first week I have found wheat bread moistened in\r\nwater the most satisfactory. If you can feed them by sunrise for the\r\nfirst three or four weeks, you need lose hardly a bird. Each evening\r\ntry and call them nearer and nearer home, so that you will not be\r\ntroubled with their wandering to the neighbors'. As early as possible\r\ntrain them to roost high, so as to be out of danger at night. Bird\r\ndogs are often very destructive to turkeys, at times destroying a\r\nwhole flock in a single night. Fatten with corn. The turkey crop ought\r\nto be one of the most profitable on our farms.\r\n\r\nDr. G.G. GROFF.\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAHAM.\r\n\r\nTurkeys want care, especially for the first two or three weeks. I feed\r\ngraham and wheat bread, made by scalding the flour, making a very\r\nstiff dough, and baking in a hot oven; soak over night in cold water.\r\nI also give them plenty of young onions, cutting them up with\r\nscissors. Be careful not to let young turkeys out in the morning while\r\nthe grass is wet. After the birds are two weeks old I feed wheat, but\r\nno corn until they are about a month old. I like hen mothers best, for\r\nturkey mothers are rangers, and do not take kindly to being kept in a\r\ncoop. The bread will keep a week if made right, but do not soak more\r\nthan will be wanted in a day, as it soon sours. I feed scraps from the\r\ntable, such as potatoes and bits of meat cut very fine, but not much\r\nof the latter to young birds. I rarely lose a bird.--_Mrs. E. Reith,\r\nin Homestead._\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE AND GENERAL MANAGEMENT.\r\n\r\nIn turkey raising the one who is the most careful and attentive to the\r\nsmall things is the most successful. The first laying of eggs should\r\nbe set under a chicken hen. The turkey hen will, after a few days'\r\nconfinement, lay another batch of eggs. A good-sized hen will cover\r\nand care for ten eggs; a turkey hen, seventeen. Make a large, roomy\r\nnest of soft, fine hay--straw is too brittle and slippery. If there is\r\ndanger of lice in the nest-box, sprinkle with water in which carbolic\r\nacid has been mixed in the proportion of eight drops to a half gallon\r\nof water. Don't wet the eggs with this. After the eggs have been sat\r\non one week, sprinkle with warm water every other day, until the last\r\nweek; then every day, until they hatch. Have the water clear, and use\r\na flower or fine rose sprinkler. Let the water be of the same\r\ntemperature as the eggs, which can be ascertained by slipping a\r\nthermometer under the hen for a few minutes. This softens the shells,\r\nand as a little turkey is very weak, it is helped out easily, and is\r\nstronger than if working long to get out.\r\n\r\nLet the little turkeys get well dried and strong enough to climb\r\naround the edges of their nest before taking them off. Have a pen, say\r\nsix feet square, built for them, and made tight at the sides clear\r\ndown to the ground, to keep them from getting out and being chilled.\r\nPut sand and fine gravel over the ground, and cover enough of it to\r\nafford shelter at night and when it rains. They may be kept in this\r\npen the first four or five days, then let out after dew is off, and\r\nshut up before night.\r\n\r\nFor the first few days' feed, nothing is better than clabber cheese or\r\ncurd made by scalding clabbered milk until the curd separates and is\r\ncooked, then skimmed out and fed. Mix a little black pepper with this\r\nevery other day. Meal must not be fed raw for several weeks, and then\r\nshould be mixed with sour milk instead of water. Bake the meal into\r\nbread by mixing it, unsifted, with sour milk, and adding a little soda\r\nand pepper. Spinach, lettuce, onion tops and any other tender greens,\r\nchopped fine, are excellent food. From the time a turkey is hatched\r\nuntil it is ready for market it should have plenty of milk. Give them\r\nclear water to drink, for milk is a food. See that the very young ones\r\nhave milk and water in quite shallow dishes, for they are in danger of\r\ngetting wet if the dish is deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nGATHER THE LITTLE TURKEYS IN\r\n\r\nat the first signs of rain, and they will soon learn to run and fly to\r\ntheir coop at the first drops. Always shut them up at night, for they\r\nare early risers and will be out long before the dew is dried off.\r\nDon't pen them too near the house. Feed them at or near the same place\r\nall the time and they will learn to go there when hungry. Give them a\r\ngood feed at night and they will remember to come home for it. If the\r\nmorning is dry, feed lightly and let them hunt the rest in the orchard\r\nand fields. Keep the grass and weeds mowed around their pen and\r\nfeeding places. Mix slaked lime in the dust for them to take their\r\ndust bath in, and sprinkle the carbolic acid and water over and around\r\ntheir roosting pen. Keep pails and kettles covered, for they will get\r\ndrowned if they have half a chance, as they begin to fly so young. Of\r\ncourse a turkey hen will take her young off, and care for them after a\r\nfashion, but the safest way to make them tame is to raise them where\r\nthey may be cared for. Even if the turkey hen hatches her last batch\r\nof eggs, it is a good plan to have a hen ready to take the little\r\nturkeys and slip them away at night. If she still stays on her nest\r\ngive her 20 or 25 hen's eggs, and if she hatches them let her run with\r\nthe chickens. They are not so tender or so easily led astray as\r\nturkeys are, nor as valuable.--_Mrs. Jas. R. Hinds, in Orange Judd\r\nFarmer._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER AS A THERAPEUTICAL AGENT.\r\n\r\nBy F.C. ROBINSON, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy experience in the use of water in almost every disease occurring in\r\nthis climate has long since satisfied me that it is less objectionable\r\nand produces quicker and better results than any other treatment, and\r\ncan be used when all other medication is contra-indicated. Drinking\r\nwater should be pure, uncontaminated by animal or vegetable\r\nimpurities, and given _ad libitum_, unless, in rare instances, it\r\nshould cause vomiting or interfere with the capability of digesting\r\nfood. If children are comatose or delirious, as they frequently are in\r\ntyphoid fever, give water to them regularly, or force it upon them, if\r\nthey refuse to take it, as I was obliged to do with a child of six\r\nyears just recovering from that fever.\r\n\r\nIt is my custom to allow cold drinks of water in all cases of measles\r\nwhenever patients desire it, and I am satisfied that it aids the early\r\nappearance of the rash, and certainly is cooling and grateful to the\r\npatient. Hot drinks or vile and nauseous teas are unnecessary in this\r\ndisease, and should be discarded as useless, odious, and disgusting.\r\nIf congestion of the lungs or any intercurrent inflammation occurs, or\r\nthe rash is much delayed, a hot water bath or the old reliable corn\r\nsweat will break up the complication with amazing rapidity, and if the\r\nhead is kept cool, will not generally be unacceptable to the patient.\r\n\r\nHot baths reduce temperature by causing free perspiration afterward,\r\nand cold packs reduce it by cooling the surface sufficiently long to\r\nreduce the heat of the blood, and, if used judiciously, seldom fail of\r\nsuccess. I have reduced the temperature four degrees in two hours by\r\nwrapping around a child a sheet wet with tepid water, and no other\r\ncovering. Cold packs are sometimes objectionable, because of their\r\ndepressing effects, and should only be used to reduce high temperature\r\nand when there is no congestion or inflammation of any of the vital\r\norgans of the body.\r\n\r\nCold water poured in a small stream from a pitcher upon the head for\r\nfive or ten minutes will often relieve headache, and is a benefit in\r\nall inflammatory brain diseases, if, at the same time, you can put the\r\nfeet into hot water containing mustard or pepper.\r\n\r\nLarge enemas of warm water will care for spasmodic colic, and I have,\r\nin one instance, relieved strangulated hernia by the same method, and\r\nat another time the same result was accomplished by a large injection\r\nof warm linseed oil. I have often applied a cloth wet with cold water\r\nupon the throats of children suffering with spasmodic croup, with\r\nsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\nI have seen infants suffering with diarrhea or summer complaint,\r\nsleepless, worrying, fretting, or crying from thirst, begging for\r\nwater, and the mother or nurse afraid to give it more than a\r\nteaspoonful or two at a time, saying that it vomited everything it\r\ndrank as soon as taken. I have often, when visiting such cases, called\r\nfor a glass of cold water, and, to the surprise of the mother, would\r\nallow it to take all it could drink, which usually would be retained,\r\nand the child would soon be wrapped in a refreshing sleep. Without\r\nmedicine, a proper regulation of the child's diet would soon restore\r\nit to health again.\r\n\r\nThe spasms of children, from whatever causes, or the eclampsia from\r\nuræmic poisoning, are often readily controlled when immersed in hot\r\nwater or given a hot vapor bath or corn sweat. If the convulsions of\r\nchildren are accompanied by a high temperature, put them into water of\r\n100° and then gradually cool it down to 68° or 70°, and then keep them\r\nin a room of the same temperature, with little covering. If the\r\ntemperature rises, repeat the treatment as frequently as necessary,\r\nand I think you will not be disappointed in the results.\r\n\r\nScarlet fever and diphtheria, two of the most dreaded and formidable\r\ndiseases of children, are largely shorn of their terrors when, in\r\naddition to an early and thorough medicinal treatment, the little\r\npatients are bathed in as warm water as the surface will allow\r\nfrequently, or for thirty minutes wrapped in a warm, wet blanket,\r\nfollowed by warm, dry coverings, to maintain the perspiration that\r\nsuch treatment usually produces. It has proved to me a valuable aid in\r\neliminating from the blood the specific poison which causes these\r\ndiseases, and I can safely recommend it to your notice and trial.\r\n\r\nThere is no disease more favorably influenced by this treatment than\r\npneumonia, and in mild cases one daily warm bath or sweat, without\r\nmedicine, will be sufficient to arrest this disease, and it is among\r\nthe first things I usually order. If I find a child or infant with a\r\ntemperature of 103° to 105°, short, dry, and painful cough,\r\ndyspnoea, rapid pulse, great thirst, or vomiting, with dry\r\ncrepitation in any part of the lung tissue, I order it rolled up in a\r\nblanket or sheet coming out of hot water, and in thirty minutes change\r\nit to warm, dry blankets, and soon the little fretful, worrying\r\nsufferer would rest in a quiet, peaceful sleep.--_Peoria Med.

KITCHEN, M.D., New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith perhaps the exception of heredity, the question of stimulants and\r\nnarcotics in their relation to the physical welfare of the race is\r\nsecond to none in importance. With trifling exceptions, the whole\r\nworld is addicted to their use. The universality of such use has led\r\nmany to consider them a necessity to man, and that they are God's\r\ngifts to him, and, if rightly used, are of physical benefit. It may\r\nnot be a perversion of judgment to consider that their widespread\r\npopular use is greatly due to the efforts of the race to gain\r\nanæsthesia for, and distraction from, those pains and punishments that\r\nare the inevitable sequence of departure from hygienic and social law\r\non the part of the individual, his ancestry, and society in general.\r\n\r\nThe taste for these things is acquired, not natural, though the\r\nacquisition may be through hereditary influence. An idea is held by a\r\nmajority of even fairly intelligent individuals that there is a\r\njustifiable, harmless, and even beneficial use of these substances by\r\nthe general public, though acknowledging that beyond a certain\r\nindefinite line this use becomes an abuse.\r\n\r\nI believe that there may occasionally be cases in which the physical\r\nbenefits derived from their use outweigh the injury they inflict, but\r\nI think this use is very much less than is generally supposed, and if\r\nwe can judge from the preponderance of evil effected by such use,\r\nthese substances ought to be considered as the materialized curses of\r\nGod rather than as beneficent gifts. The prevalent idea as to the\r\nbeneficent nature of these substances I consider to be a delusion that\r\ncan only be explained upon the hypothesis that there is a widespread\r\nlack of appreciation of the fact that, though they may have an\r\nimmediate pleasant and agreeable effect upon the body, their injurious\r\neffects are cumulative, and are usually ultimate, and so distant as to\r\nbe difficult of direct connection with their cause to ordinary\r\nobservation. The more moderate the use of these substances, the more\r\nremotely is the effect removed from the cause and more difficult of\r\ndetection. That the ordinary habitual, so-called moderate use of\r\nstimulants and narcotics, such as tea, coffee, tobacco, and alcohol,\r\nis, in the vast majority of cases, really an abuse, is a proposition\r\nthat I think should be admitted by all who have given the subject an\r\nunbiased study.\r\n\r\nThe idea that the user of tobacco and other injurious substances will\r\nbe cognizant of the injury inflicted by habitual use in moderate or\r\neven excessive amounts is an undoubted fallacy. The daily, weekly, or\r\nmonthly injurious effect may be entirely unobservable to even trained\r\nphysicians, and yet the ultimate cumulative effect may be fatal. I can\r\ninstance numerous cases of physicians directly fatally injured by the\r\nuse of alcohol, who have never had the slightest cognizance of the\r\nfact; and I can also instance cases of grave disease from the use of\r\ntobacco where the patients never have believed that tobacco has been\r\nthe cause of their troubles, even after a unanimous opinion to that\r\neffect has been expressed by a number of competent medical advisers.\r\nThe habitual consumption of opium, in doses of any amount, is\r\ngenerally admitted by most people to be physically injurious outside\r\nof its strict medicinal application. Moderate indulgence in alcohol as\r\na beverage is beginning to acquire a very widespread evil reputation.\r\nBut how about tobacco? Tea and coffee we can confidently leave to the\r\nconsideration of a somewhat remote posterity of a considerably\r\nadvanced intelligence and elevated hygienic ideals.\r\n\r\nThe relation of tobacco to the physical welfare of man can only be\r\nfairly estimated by viewing the subject in its broadest aspect; by\r\nconsidering its effects upon the race as a whole rather than in\r\nindividual cases; by taking into consideration economical and other\r\nsocial conditions that at first sight might be considered as having\r\nlittle relevancy to the medical side of the subject. But there can be\r\nno just consideration of the matter otherwise. The direct deleterious\r\neffects of the immoderate use of tobacco are readily observable; but\r\nthe great bulk of the evil physical effects due to the moderate use of\r\nthis plant are of an intermediate nature and not directly noticeable;\r\nnevertheless, they are real, and worthy of medical attention. The\r\nplainly marked results following the use of tobacco in relatively\r\nlarge amounts seem to be due to quick and extreme interference with\r\nnutrition, and a diminution of function of all kinds, which may be\r\nrepresented by anything from a slight decrease of appetite and\r\ndigestive ability up to a complete loss of function of almost any\r\nimportant organ. Tobacco has stimulating as well narcotic properties,\r\nbut as ordinarily used its stimulating effect appears to be slight as\r\ncompared with its narcotic influence. In this respect it differs from\r\nalcohol, the use of which, owing to the usual method of introduction\r\nin large amounts through the stomach, produces directly, by\r\nstimulation, readily noticeable structural changes. But with tobacco\r\nthe direct evil results are mostly of a functional character, and are\r\nmore generally diffused, owing to the usual slow manner of\r\nintroduction into the body. These two properties have an effect upon\r\nthe body in moderate use as well as in immoderate use, the effect\r\nbeing simply in proportion to the quantity used, though the effects of\r\nmoderate use may not be measurable by ordinary means. It is easy to\r\nsee the effects of large amounts of tobacco in the stunted growth of\r\nadolescents; in functional cardiac disorders; in intellectual\r\nsluggishness, loss of memory, and color blindness; in loss of\r\nappetite, and other neuroses of motion, and marked blunting of various\r\nfunctions of sensation, and in degeneracy of descendants; but that\r\nlesser evils are produced must be proved mostly by inference,\r\ncircumstantial collateral evidence, and analogy.\r\n\r\nThe greater evils that are the outcome of a moderate use of tobacco\r\nare probably due to prolonged slight interference with nutrition, and\r\nconsequent general decrease of vitality, which renders the individual\r\nmore susceptible through indirect influence to the invasion of\r\ndisease, and which lessens the capacity for productive effort.\r\n\r\nIt is of course difficult, and perhaps even impossible, to accurately\r\nestimate the value of tobacco to the race; but let us glance at the\r\npros and cons, and then each one can roughly estimate for himself.\r\nTobacco may be used medicinally, but it is a dangerous and uncertain\r\nremedy, and it probably has not one medicinal use that cannot be more\r\nsuitably met by other remedies. One can readily imagine easier\r\ndigestion as the result of the sedative influence of the after-dinner\r\ncigar upon a disquieted nervous system, especially if the coincident\r\nirritation of alcohol and coffee have need of correction; but it can\r\nalso be imagined that in most of such cases the remedy has been the\r\ncause of and will further increase the disordered condition, and that\r\nnutrition of deficiently nourished nerve tissue is rationally\r\nindicated rather than partial narcotization. There then remains, so\r\nfar as I can see, the solace of moderate anæsthesia and, occasionally,\r\nof occupation for idlers, as the only items that can be placed to the\r\ncredit of tobacco. There certainly are individual cases where such\r\nusage may be more provocative of physical benefit than evil, but,\r\nbefore judging for the race as a whole, compute the other side of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nTobacco injures the general health of the public through the economic\r\nloss caused by its consumption. The people of our country spend\r\nannually over seven hundred millions of dollars for tobacco--twenty\r\nper cent. more than is spent for bread. This sum represents only a\r\nminor part of the cost of the tobacco habit to the country. The crop\r\nis immensely exhaustive to the soil. Its culture has blighted whole\r\nsections of fertile territory. In the time consumed by the producer\r\nand the trader in its production, manufacture, and sale, and by the\r\nconsumer in its use, and by the general interference with vital\r\nactivity and consequent decreased productive capacity, there is\r\nrepresented an almost unimaginable sum of money. Certainly the people\r\nat large are not so well fed both as to quantity and quality, or so\r\nthoroughly clothed, or so hygienically housed that they can afford\r\nthis gigantic economic waste.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that if the people had sufficient\r\nintelligence and moral strength to taboo tobacco, this comparatively\r\nsenseless outgo would be largely devoted to supplying these and other\r\nnecessities of an exalted health status.\r\n\r\nTobacco injures health through its moral effects. The tobacco habit is\r\ncertainly a dirty and frequently a disgusting habit, and encourages\r\nother dirty practices. Its use tends to make men cowardly, irritable\r\nin temper, and low in spirits. It blunts ideas of purity and courtesy,\r\nleading to invasion of the rights of others. It is presumed that few\r\nmedical men would visit a delicate, sensitive patient after saturation\r\nwith the \"fragrant\" effluvia of onions, but thousands whose systems\r\nare saturated with nicotine and who reek with nauseating odor do not\r\nhesitate to inflict their presence on sick or well. The time will come\r\nwhen the tobacco user will not be allowed to poison the atmosphere\r\nthat is the common property of the public--will not be allowed to\r\nforce the inhalation of nicotine upon the general public, to say\r\nnothing of being allowed to poison the infants and women in his own\r\nfamily. What would be said of a man who introduced poison in any\r\ndegree into the food or drink of his child? Is the poisoning of the\r\nhousehold atmosphere by the ignorant, thoughtless, or selfish smoker\r\nmorally more defensible? Tobacco injures health through hereditary\r\ninfluence. The tobacco user begets, more certainly than the non-user,\r\npuny children with disordered nervous conditions. Luckily for our\r\nrace, the women, who have the most important prenatal influence in\r\nguarding its physical well-being, are practically non-users of the\r\nplant. The general health status of the race is improving, not because\r\nthe use of tobacco or the indulgence in other questionable practices\r\nis harmless, but because, among other things, of the great advance in\r\ngeneral intelligence and knowledge of hygienic law.\r\n\r\nA person, or the public in general, may practice an injurious habit,\r\nand yet more than counteract its influence by opposing beneficial\r\npractices.\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley said, \"Show me a drunkard who does not use tobacco, and\r\nI will show you a white blackbird.\" In this country, where dietetic\r\ndrinking habits are not common in the family, the weakening of moral\r\nfiber by indulgence in tobacco is usually the introduction into the\r\nround of vicious indulgences, and thus directly or indirectly affects\r\nhealth. Smoking induces dryness of the mucous membrane of the mouth\r\nand consequent thirst. The partially paralyzed nerve terminals want\r\nsomething more stimulating than water to afford relief. Furthermore,\r\nblunted appetite induces deficient nutrition, and consequently there\r\nis a call for some \"pick-me-up;\" hence we find that the use of tobacco\r\ntends to the habitual use of alcoholic beverages, and there are very\r\nfew habitual users of alcohol who escape without structural injuries\r\nto the body as well as perversion of its functions. Decrease of vital\r\nactivity in all the tissues of the body marks the use of tobacco. The\r\ntendency is toward functional paralysis, though occasional signs of\r\nstimulative irritation are to be noticed, especially in the\r\nrespiratory passages. The interference with intellectual activity is\r\nmarked. It is said that during a period of fifty years no tobacco user\r\nstood at the head of his class in Harvard. The accumulated testimony\r\nof investigating observers is conclusive that, other things being\r\nequal, users of tobacco, in schools of all grades, never do so well in\r\ntheir studies as non-users.\r\n\r\nOne head of a public school said he could always tell when a boy\r\ncommenced to use tobacco by the record of his recitations. Professor\r\nOliver, of the Annapolis Academy, said he could indicate the boy who\r\nused tobacco by his absolute inability to draw a clean, straight line.\r\nThe deleterious effects of tobacco have become so clearly apparent\r\nthat we find its sale to minors is prohibited in France, Germany, and\r\nvarious sections of this country. It is somewhat a question if, at the\r\npresent time, the race is not doing itself more injury by its use of\r\ntobacco than it is with alcohol, because of its more universal use,\r\nparticularly by youth, and because of the respectability of the habit,\r\nwhich comes of its use by a certain intelligent part of the race,\r\nincluding teachers of morals and physics, and even temperance\r\nreformers. There is a widespread sentiment in existence that it is not\r\na respectable thing to be even partly paralyzed by alcohol, but how\r\nfew there are who consider narcosis as in any way connected with the\r\nuse of tobacco. Its effect is more diffused and masked, and is not so\r\nacutely serious in individual cases, but through its interference with\r\nvital activity, tobacco is probably more generally injurious to the\r\nrace than alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe editorial fiat of \"too long\" prevents a full exposition of the\r\nsubject, but, in closing, let me say I hear millions of tobacco users\r\nask, \"Why, then, was this plant given to man, if its general effects\r\nare so decidedly evil?\" The question presupposes design in creation.\r\nWithout subscribing to this theory, or pretending to have solved the\r\nmystery of the presence of evil in the world, the answer may be\r\nsuggested that the overcoming of many seductive evils becomes to man a\r\nmeans of his progressive higher development. Of one thing I am\r\nconvinced, that the physical development and welfare of man is\r\ninterfered with in strict sequence to his consumption of substances\r\nthat are unnecessary for his nutrition--stimulants and narcotics\r\ninclusive.--_Medical Record._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACETIC ACID AS A DISINFECTANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. F. Engelmann, in _Cent. f. Gyn._, claims that acetic acid\r\npossesses equally as good antiseptic properties as carbolic acid; in\r\nfact, that it is to be preferred, as it is completely harmless, even\r\nif used in concentrated solutions, and that it is a valuable\r\nhæmostatic, an advantageous addition particularly in obstetrics.\r\nAnother important property is its ease of transition into the tissues,\r\nwhich, according to Engelmann's experiments, is by far greater than\r\nthat of all the other antiseptics. Of bichloride it is well known that\r\nit forms an insoluble combination with albumen, and can therefore act\r\nonly on the surface, while acetic acid extends into the deeper tissues\r\nwith ease.\r\n\r\nAcetic acid also affects the metal of the instruments, but not as\r\nseverely as the bichloride; the forceps, for instance, may be placed\r\nfor a quarter of an hour in an irrigator filled with a three per cent.\r\nsolution of acetic acid without being injured.\r\n\r\nA pleasant effect of acetic acid is that it softens and lubricates the\r\nskin. The author generally used a three per cent. solution; at times\r\nhe has made use of a five per cent. solution, which would easily cause\r\na painful burning at sore places, so that he only used the latter\r\nstrength in septic cases, as the three per cent. solution proved to be\r\na satisfactory antiseptic for general purposes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTER-IRRITATION IN WHOOPING COUGH.\r\n\r\nBy G.F. INGLOTT, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo combat this often distressing disease I have tried the\r\nadministration of several medicines, namely, bromide of potassium,\r\nasafoetida, valerian, morphine, belladonna, etc., and I have very\r\nclosely watched their effects, but none of them proved of much use.\r\nHaving observed, however, that during the late cholera epidemic some\r\nof the patients admitted into the hospital under my medical charge\r\nslept well, had their anxiety improved, and some of them ultimately\r\nrecovered, after the application of a strong counter-irritation of the\r\npneumogastric nerves in the neck, namely, between the mastoid process\r\nand the angle of the lower jaw, I tried the same treatment on whooping\r\npatients, and I have no hesitation in stating that the result was very\r\nsatisfactory. I may quote one single case of the many I have had under\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nA boy, aged twelve years, of weak constitution, was suffering from\r\nfrequent and intense attacks of whooping cough. At a time the fits\r\nwere so vehement that blood came out of his eyes and mouth. The case\r\nwas a severe one, and I thought it would very likely end fatally. I\r\nprescribed several medicines, and even subcutaneous injections of\r\nmorphine, but without any avail. I then tried for the first time the\r\ncounter-irritation on both sides of the neck, and this means acted\r\nlike magic. In four or five days the patient recovered, and was able\r\nto go to school. Since that time I have been applying the same\r\ntreatment, either on the right side only or on both, with the greatest\r\nbenefit.--_Br. Med.

His researches extended over many\r\nclasses of animals. As representing mammals, guinea pigs were chiefly\r\nused; and for reptiles, snakes; while in addition the embryos of\r\nfishes, frogs, mollusks, and other lower animals were also employed.\r\nBut of all animals birds are most suitable for embryological\r\nobservations, inasmuch as with due precautions the development of one\r\nand the same individual can be followed for a considerable time.\r\nBirds' eggs can be incubated in a warm chamber, and by removing a\r\nportion of the shell and replacing it by an unbroken piece from\r\nanother egg, it becomes possible to follow the daily development of\r\nthe chick and to experiment upon it. As early as the ninetieth hour of\r\nincubation, spontaneous \"impulsive\" movements may be observed, taking\r\nplace apparently without any external stimulus as a cause, and at a\r\ntime when no muscles or nerves have as yet been developed. After the\r\noccurrence of these spontaneous movements, and at the earliest on the\r\nfifth day of incubation, movements are observed to result from the\r\napplication of mechanical, chemical, and electrical stimuli. In order\r\nto observe these the eggs must be allowed to cool down until all\r\nspontaneous movements have ceased. From the tenth to the thirteenth\r\nday more complicated and reflex actions occur on the application of\r\nstimuli, as, for instance, movements of the eyelids, beak, and limbs;\r\nand if the stimuli are strong, reflex respiratory movements. These\r\nreflexes make their appearance before any ganglia have become\r\ndifferentiated. Prof. Preyer considered himself justified in\r\nconcluding from this that ganglia are not essential for the liberation\r\nof reflex actions. He intends, on some future occasion, to give a more\r\ndetailed account of these experiments, and of the conclusions which\r\nmay be drawn from them. In the discussion which ensued the conclusions\r\nof the speaker were contested from many sides.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRIDESCENT CRYSTALS.[1]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: Abstract of the Friday evening lecture delivered by\r\n   Lord Rayleigh, F.R.S., at the Royal Institution, on April 12,\r\n   1889.]\r\n\r\nBy LORD RAYLEIGH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal subject of the lecture is the peculiar colored\r\nreflection observed in certain specimens of chlorate of potash.\r\nReflection implies a high degree of discontinuity. In some cases, as\r\nin decomposed glass, and probably in opals, the discontinuity is due\r\nto the interposition of layers of air; but, as was proved by Stokes,\r\nin the case of chlorate crystals the discontinuity is that known as\r\ntwinning. The seat of the color is a very thin layer in the interior\r\nof the crystal and parallel to its faces.\r\n\r\nThe following laws were discovered by Stokes:\r\n\r\n    (1) If one of the crystalline plates be turned round in its own\r\n    plane, without alteration of the angle of incidence, the\r\n    peculiar reflection vanishes twice in a revolution, viz., when\r\n    the plane of incidence coincides with the plane of symmetry of\r\n    the crystal. [Shown.]\r\n\r\n    (2) As the angle of incidence is increased, the reflected light\r\n    becomes brighter and rises in refrangibility. [Shown.]\r\n\r\n    (3) The colors are not due to absorption, the transmitted light\r\n    being strictly complementary to the reflected.\r\n\r\n    (4) The colored light is not polarized. It is produced\r\n    indifferently, whether the incident light be common light or\r\n    light polarized in any plane, and is seen whether the reflected\r\n    light be viewed directly or through a Nicol's prism turned in\r\n    any way. [Shown.]\r\n\r\n    (5) The spectrum of the reflected light is frequently found to\r\n    consist almost entirely of a comparatively narrow band. When the\r\n    angle of incidence is increased, the band moves in the direction\r\n    of increasing refrangibility, and at the same time increases\r\n    rapidly in width. In many cases the reflection appears to be\r\n    almost total.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1 GENERAL SCHEME\r\n               FIG. 2 DETAIL OF LAZY-TONGS]\r\n\r\nIn order to project these phenomena a crystal is prepared by cementing\r\na smooth face to a strip of glass whose sides are not quite parallel.\r\nThe white reflection from the anterior face of the glass can then be\r\nseparated from the real subject of the experiment.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable feature in the reflected light remains to be\r\nnoticed. If the angle of incidence be small, and if the incident light\r\nbe polarized in or perpendicularly to the plane of incidence, the\r\nreflected light is polarized in the _opposite_ manner. [Shown.]\r\n\r\nSimilar phenomena, except that the reflection is white, are exhibited\r\nby crystals prepared in a manner described by Madan. If the crystal be\r\nheated beyond a certain point the peculiar reflection disappears, but\r\nreturns upon cooling. [Shown.]\r\n\r\nIn all these cases there can be little doubt that the reflection takes\r\nplace at twin surfaces, the theory of such reflection (_Phil. Mag._,\r\nSept., 1888) reproducing with remarkable exactness most of the\r\nfeatures above described. In order to explain the vigor and purity of\r\nthe color reflected in certain crystals, it is necessary to suppose\r\nthat there are a considerable number of twin surfaces disposed at\r\napproximate equal intervals. At each angle of incidence there would be\r\na particular wave length for which the phases of the several\r\nreflections are in agreement. The selection of light of a particular\r\nwave length would thus take place upon the same principle as in\r\ndiffraction spectra, and might reach a high degree of perfection.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of this explanation an acoustical analogue is\r\nexhibited. The successive twin planes are imitated by parallel and\r\nequidistant disks of muslin (Figs. 1 and 2) stretched upon brass rings\r\nand mounted (with the aid of three lazy-tongs arrangements) so that\r\nthere is but one degree of freedom to move, and that of such a\r\ncharacter as to vary the interval between the disks without disturbing\r\ntheir equidistance and parallelism.\r\n\r\nThe source of sound is a bird call, giving a pure tone of high pitch\r\n(inaudible), and the percipient is a high-pressure flame issuing from\r\na burner so oriented that the direct waves are without influence upon\r\nthe flame (see _Nature_, xxxviii., 208; Proc. Roy. Inst., January,\r\n1888). But the waves reflected from the muslin arrive in the effective\r\ndirection, and if of sufficient intensity induce flaring. The\r\nexperiment consists in showing that the action depends upon the\r\ndistance between the disks. If the distance be such that the waves\r\nreflected from the several disks co-operate,[2] the flame flares, but\r\nfor intermediate adjustments recovers its equilibrium. For full\r\nsuccess it is necessary that the reflective power of a single disk be\r\nneither too great nor too small. A somewhat open fabric appears\r\nsuitable.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 2: If the reflection were perpendicular, the interval\r\n   between successive disks would be equal to the half wave-length,\r\n   or to some multiple of this.]\r\n\r\nIt was shown by Brewster that certain natural specimens of Iceland\r\nspar are traversed by thin twin strata. A convergent beam, reflected\r\nat a nearly grazing incidence from the twin planes, depicts upon the\r\nscreen an arc of light, which is interrupted by a dark spot\r\ncorresponding to the plane of symmetry. [Shown.] A similar experiment\r\nmay be made with small rhombs in which twin layers have been developed\r\nby mechanical force after the manner of Reusch.\r\n\r\nThe light reflected from fiery opals has been shown by Crookes to\r\npossess in many cases a high degree of purity, rivaling in this\r\nrespect the reflection from chlorate of potash.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is to be sought in a periodic stratified structure.\r\nBut the other features differ widely in the two cases. There is here\r\nno semicircular evanescence, as the specimen is rotated in azimuth. On\r\nthe contrary, the colored light transmitted perpendicularly through a\r\nthin plate of opal undergoes no change when the gem is turned round in\r\nits own plane. This appears to prove that the alternate states are not\r\nrelated to one another as twin crystals. More probably the alternate\r\nstrata are of air, as in decomposed glass. The brilliancy of opals is\r\nsaid to be readily affected by atmospheric conditions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW CATALOGUE OF VALUABLE PAPERS\r\n\r\nContained in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT during the past\r\nten years, sent _free of charge_ to any address.
